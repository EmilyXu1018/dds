                        Hey, pipe down, you mugs.<br> Sorry to break up the game, boys...<br> but the old man's having bunk inspection<br> in an hour.<br> Give me my bones!<br> This man's army ain't been nothing<br> but just one inspection after another.<br> If ever I get back to Texas<br> on that range again...<br> the first man who says "inspection"<br> to me...<br> he's going to be S.O.L.,<br> because he'll hear from my six-shooter.<br> And I mean sure enough, too.<br> There'll be no inspection where I'm going.<br> Where's that?<br> Why, back into vaudeville<br> with my old lion-taming act!<br> I wonder if Oscar and Minnie will know me<br> when I step back into the cage.<br> You better hope they do.<br> I know what I'm gonna do.<br> Get me some kind of construction job.<br> I didn't know that was your line, Sergeant.<br> It wasn't, but it's going to be.<br> Being in the Engineering Corps<br> has been swell experience...<br> and I'm making the most of it.<br> Well, we'll be reading about you<br> in the newspapers, I'll bet.<br> "Mr. James Allen is building<br> a new Panama Canal." Or something.<br> You can bet your tin hat Mr. James Allen<br> won't be back in the old grind of a factory.<br> Do you think he'll be wearing his medal?<br> Why, of course he will.<br> - Mom!<br> - Jim!<br> It's good to have you back.<br> You're a little thinner, Jim.<br> Your cooking will fix that up.<br> Clint! Well, you haven't changed a bit.<br> But, Alice, I wouldn't have known you.<br> She's grown up, hasn't she?<br> She certainly has.<br> And you look different, too.<br> I think it's the uniform I miss.<br> It made you look taller<br> and more distinguished.<br> I got a regular welcome-home party here,<br> haven't I?<br> Mr. Parker, it's nice of you to be here.<br> You have a lot to thank Mr. Parker for.<br> That's nothing.<br> He feels after all you've been through,<br> we owe you something.<br> Mr. Parker is going to take you back<br> into the factory.<br> I've saved your old job for you.<br> You've done your bit<br> and your boss isn't going to forget you.<br> Well, I have...<br> I'm so glad to have you back.<br> I guess we'd better go home,<br> don't you think?<br> All right, I'll take this.<br> I'll see you later, Jim. Goodbye.<br> The old place hasn't changed a bit.<br> Well, let's sit down and have a talk.<br> Tell us all about the war.<br> I won't live that long.<br> What did you think<br> of Mr. Parker being at the station?<br> Say, Clint. Speaking of Mr. Parker,<br> will you do something for me?<br> Sure. What is it?<br> Well, will you talk to him for me<br> and tell him I'm not going to take that job?<br> And why should I tell him that?<br> It's kind of hard to explain.<br> But you see, the Army changes a fellow.<br> It kind of makes you think different.<br> I don't want to spend the rest of my life...<br> answering a factory whistle,<br> instead of a bugle call...<br> or be cooped up<br> in a shipping room all day.<br> I want to do something worthwhile.<br> Jim, how can you talk like that?<br> He's tired, Mother. Excited.<br> You don't know what you are saying.<br> But tomorrow morning,<br> after a good night's sleep...<br> you'll be ready to take up<br> where you left off at the factory.<br> A soldier of peace<br> instead of a soldier of war.<br> I don't want to be a soldier of anything.<br> You see, Mom...<br> I want to get out.<br> Away from routine.<br> I've had enough of that in the Army.<br> You found another job?<br> Not exactly, Mom...<br> but you see, I've been doing<br> engineering work in the Army...<br> and that's the kind of work<br> I want to do now.<br> A man's job.<br> Where you can accomplish things.<br> Where you can build, construct, create.<br> Do things!<br> That sounds very nice.<br> But after all...<br> a job in the hand is worth two in the bush.<br> I don't want to tell you what to do, Jim...<br> but when you were in the war...<br> every time I passed the factory...<br> I was wishing for the day<br> my boy would be working there again.<br> We've moved things around quite a bit.<br> This is a lot nicer<br> than the old shipping room, isn't it?<br> You'll sit by this window<br> and check the shipments.<br> The job's just about the same.<br> Before you know it, you'll be doing it again<br> with your eyes shut.<br> They're excavating. I shouldn't think<br> that would scare you.<br> I was looking for the nearest dugout.<br> You'll hear lots of those explosions.<br> They're building a new bridge over there.<br> Better get busy<br> and file those bills of lading.<br> Yes, sir.<br> It might do some good<br> if you had another talk with Jim.<br> I certainly intend to.<br> Parker's given him a job anyone in town<br> would grab, and what does he do?<br> Checks in day after day late from lunch.<br> Loitering around that new bridge<br> for no reason at all.<br> He'll come out of it...<br> but it worries me, too.<br> Is that you, Jim?<br> It's me, Mom.<br> Maybe you could speak to him now.<br> - Hello, Clint.<br> - You're quite a stranger here.<br> - Had your supper?<br> - No, I'm not hungry.<br> - But you should have a bite of something.<br> - I can't, Mom. I don't feel like it.<br> Well, anyway, sit down.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Jim, Mr. Parker's very disappointed in you.<br> You haven't shown him anything.<br> You know your duty is to your job.<br> I know it, but I just can't help it.<br> Maybe you're not well, dear.<br> It isn't that, Mom. I'm all right.<br> I try my best when I get there,<br> but I just can't concentrate.<br> It's not the kind of work I want to do.<br> I said so when I came home.<br> It's too monotonous.<br> But you don't seem to realize...<br> That's it, realize. No one seems to realize<br> that I have changed. I'm different now.<br> I've been through hell.<br> Folks here are concerned with my uniform,<br> how I dance.<br> I'm out of step with everybody.<br> All this while I was hoping to come home<br> and start a new life, to be free...<br> and again I find myself under orders.<br> A drab routine, cramped, mechanical.<br> Even worse than the Army.<br> And you, all of you trying your darnedest<br> to map out my future...<br> to harness me and lead me around<br> to do what you think is best for me.<br> It doesn't occur to you that I've grown...<br> that I've learned life is more important<br> than a medal on my chest...<br> or a stupid, insignificant job.<br> - Appreciation. Why, you've...<br> - Clint.<br> What would you do, son?<br> Where would you go?<br> Somewhere. Anywhere, Mom,<br> just where I can do what I want to.<br> If that's really in your heart...<br> I think you certainly should follow it.<br> I knew you'd understand.<br> Before we know it,<br> he'll be leaving us again.<br> That doesn't matter.<br> He's got to be happy.<br> He's got to find himself.<br> You're a peach, Mom.<br> I know where there's a lot of construction<br> going on. Up in New England.<br> Hey, Allen! Allen!<br> Calling me?<br> Yeah, knock off a minute.<br> I want to see you.<br> - Well?<br> - Bad news for you.<br> We're cutting down<br> and the new men will have to go. Sorry.<br> All right.<br> - You the boss here?<br> - Yep.<br> Think you could use a good man?<br> Last week I could have used you,<br> but I'm full up now.<br> - You're new here, ain't you, buddy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Just filling in for a couple of days.<br> Believe me, I'm glad to be working.<br> It's my first job in four months.<br> What can I do for you?<br> How much can you give me<br> for this Belgian Croix de Guerre?<br> Come here, mister.<br> Look.<br> How about some poker<br> to see who bums the handout?<br> No, I'm afraid not.<br> I'm new in this town<br> and not on to the ropes.<br> - Been on the road?<br> - Yeah.<br> I took to walking the ties<br> when my Rolls-Royce broke down.<br> - What's your name?<br> - James Allen.<br> James Allen? That'll do, I guess.<br> Mine's Pete.<br> - Glad to know you, Pete.<br> - Glad to know you, Allen.<br> I'm hungry.<br> What would you say to a hamburger?<br> What would I say to a hamburger?<br> I'd shake Mr. Hamburger by the hand<br> and say:<br> "Pal, I haven't seen you<br> in a long, long time."<br> I think I can mooch a couple<br> in the lunch wagon down the street.<br> The guy who runs it is a pretty soft egg.<br> What do you say?<br> Boy, I hope you ain't fooling.<br> How about giving<br> me and my friend a handout?<br> I was hoping you'd left town.<br> No, I've incorporated. Meet my partner.<br> Say, I've been laying off you<br> for a couple of days. Come on, be a sport.<br> All right. You guys sit over there.<br> What do I owe you?<br> Fifteen cents.<br> Business is pretty good?<br> Yeah, pretty good.<br> How good?<br> Hey, what is this?<br> Put your hands on that counter<br> and lean over like we're talking.<br> Get that dough out of the register.<br> - Listen...<br> - Go on, do as I say.<br> Go on.<br> How much is it?<br> Around $5.<br> There ought to be more. Where is it?<br> No, that's all.<br> Put it in your pocket and come on. Move!<br> And don't start yelling for the cops.<br> You don't have to yell, Mike.<br> Put them up.<br> Thought you'd get away?<br> I didn't do nothing.<br> - Oh, no?<br> - No.<br> I see no reason for leniency since<br> the money was found on your person.<br> Furthermore, upon detection,<br> you attempted to escape...<br> which would, of necessity,<br> increase the seriousness of your offence.<br> I therefore,<br> in accordance with the laws of this state...<br> sentence you to 10 years of hard labor.<br> A nice lucky number.<br> What's this for?<br> To put in your nose.<br> All right.<br> Follow me.<br> All right, pick them up.<br> Come on, pull them through.<br> All right, turn off.<br> That'll learn you to sit up<br> and hold on to this.<br> All right, you guys, get going there.<br> Get those shoes on and get up.<br> All right, come and get it.<br> Come on, hurry it up.<br> Pick up that chain.<br> Come on, move on.<br> Here, take that.<br> Grease, fried dough, pig fat and sorghum.<br> And you better get to like it...<br> because you're going to get<br> the same thing every morning, every year.<br> You can't get better food<br> on any chain gang in the state.<br> Yeah, and you can go all over the world<br> and you won't find worse.<br> How can anybody eat a mess like this?<br> Why do you take that slime<br> if you're going to spit it out?<br> I'm practicing.<br> The last day of my year here,<br> I'll spit it right in the warden's kisser.<br> Yeah? You'll blind him for life.<br> Hurry up, come on, let's go.<br> Come on, move on!<br> - Come on, there. You, get in there.<br> - Get in that line.<br> Hurry up. Come on, by me.<br> Line up, there. Come on.<br> All right, load the trucks.<br> Come on.<br> Hurry up.<br> Get your rings up.<br> Put them up.<br> All right.<br> Come on, get that ring up.<br> All right, take them out.<br> Are you up here for murder, kid?<br> No.<br> I heard that a guy that killed four people<br> was being sent up here.<br> Nordine's always worrying<br> about losing his spot here as high man.<br> He only killed three.<br> More than anyone else<br> in this here chain gang.<br> His wife, his sister-in-law,<br> and his mother-in-law.<br> Killed them in one night with an ax...<br> so as not to disturb the neighbors.<br> What are you taking the rap for, kid?<br> For looking at a hamburger.<br> Come on, tell us.

If I hurt your leg,<br> your foot will drop off with the shackle.<br> Again.<br> Now the other one.<br> Again.<br> Once more.<br> Five.<br> Six.<br> Seven.<br> Eight.<br> Nine.<br> Ten.<br> When you gonna do it?<br> - Monday.<br> - That's good.<br> You can rest up for it on Sunday.<br> - Got any dough?<br> - A little.<br> Here's $7.<br> When you get to Stanton,<br> look up Barney. Here's his address.<br> - He'll take care of you.<br> - Thanks, Bomber.<br> - Nervous?<br> - A little.<br> No matter what happens,<br> it's better than this.<br> Get them over there.<br> What do you think?<br> Looks pretty good to me.<br> Getting out here.<br> All right, get out over in there.<br> Hey, boss, we need some more help here.<br> Some of you boys give Bomber a hand.<br> All right, Allen. Get back to work.<br> Bring those dogs over here!<br> He won't get far.<br> Stand where you are.<br> Where do you suppose he's gone?<br> Let's try these woods over here.<br> Come on. Go get him.<br> Get him.<br> You look like a new man.<br> - Now show me something in a cheap hat.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> How did you get the scratches?<br> Lumberjacking, up in the hills.<br> Is that a fact?<br> I know many of them fellows up there.<br> Funny I ain't seen you before.<br> - Look out.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> How do you do?<br> Well, if it ain't old John Law himself.<br> - How's the rheumatism?<br> - Good.<br> If they don't take me off nights<br> and put me on days, I'm gonna...<br> I'll... What's the use?<br> What's new? Anything?<br> Nothing.<br> There was a break on the Merritt County<br> chain gang this morning.<br> They say he's headed up this way.<br> What's the guy look like?<br> He's about 5'10", heavy black hair...<br> brown eyes, stocky built,<br> around 30 years old.<br> Name is Allen, James Allen.<br> - Get us a hot towel, will you?<br> - Coming up.<br> Hope it's hot enough for you.<br> Those guys haven't got much chance<br> getting away with it, have they?<br> No. We've got the depot<br> and all the highways out of town covered.<br> They can get this far and no farther.<br> Thanks. Come in again.<br> How was it? Close enough?<br> Plenty.<br> So you hung it on the limb?<br> It's good to see you, kid.<br> - Well, how do you suppose I feel?<br> - What? How?<br> Bomber tipped me off where you were.<br> - All right for Bomber.<br> - Say, you got a place I can hide out?<br> - Sure, come on. I'll fix you up.<br> - That's great.<br> How are all the boys on the chain gang?<br> No, but I had to keep my eyes open<br> every minute.<br> Do you think I'll be safe here tonight?<br> It's a cinch,<br> unless the cops pull another raid.<br> But don't worry about that.<br> They're probably too busy<br> looking for you to raid any joints like this.<br> All I need is some sleep.<br> I'll lam out of here early in the morning.<br> Make yourself at home.<br> We got everything you dream about<br> in the chain gang.<br> Here. I guess you still know<br> what this is good for?<br> Thanks. I got a tough day<br> ahead of me tomorrow.<br> Well, I got a tough night ahead of me.<br> I got to beat it now, Jim.<br> But the place is yours.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I'll get somebody<br> to see that you're comfortable.<br> Linda, come here.<br> This is Jim Allen, a pal of mine<br> from the chain gang. He's just escaped.<br> - Listen, never mind the advertising.<br> - It's all right with Linda.<br> Take good care of him, babe.<br> He's my personal guest.<br> - So long, Jim. I hope you make it.<br> - Thanks.<br> You've got plenty of what it takes<br> to pull an escape from that place.<br> I'm not safe yet.<br> Not until I'm out of the state.<br> If there's anything I can do to help you,<br> just say the word.<br> Thanks.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> - How about a drink?<br> - No.<br> - You don't mind if I take one, do you?<br> - No, go right ahead.<br> Here's to you.<br> A guy with your nerves<br> got the breaks coming to him.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> I understand.<br> You're among friends.<br> You have about 35 minutes to wait.<br> The train is late.<br> - You want everything on this one, too?<br> - Yeah, same as the first one.<br> Well, look who's here.<br> Chief of police, in all his glory.<br> Must be looking for somebody important.<br> All right, boys, keep your eyes open.<br> All aboard!<br> There he is!<br> Did I get your ticket?<br> Here it is.<br> Booneville? You must have got on<br> without me seeing you.<br> They were chasing somebody.<br> I guess you were watching.<br> - They were after an escaped convict.<br> - Catch him?<br> No, the guy they caught<br> turned out to be a hobo.<br> They're still looking for the convict.<br> I guess we can use you. What's the name?<br> - Allen.<br> - Is that the first or last name?<br> Yeah, the first name.<br> The full name is Allen James.<br> - Report 8:00 tomorrow morning.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Say, James...<br> that's a swell idea you had<br> about the bend up there.<br> - I told the boss it was your suggestion.<br> - You did? That's very nice.<br> I don't think you'll be swinging a pick<br> much longer.<br> This is the room that's for rent.<br> Very nice room.<br> What are you asking for it?<br> - $25 a month. And that's very reasonable.<br> - Very.<br> But it's more than I feel I can pay.<br> I'm sorry, because I like the location.<br> It's not far from the bridge I'm working on.<br> I'm sorry, too...<br> because I'd like to rent this room<br> to a gentleman like yourself.<br> But you don't know anything about me.<br> I can tell. You look like you'd be friendly.<br> Not like a stranger around the house.<br> - How much would you be willing to pay?<br> - Really, it's out of the question.<br> Well, suppose I made it $20.<br> That's silly.<br> You can easily get your price for it.<br> I'm willing to let it go for $20. To you.<br> Well, it's a mighty nice room.<br> You'll like it.<br> - Hello, honey.<br> - Hello.<br> - All you do every night is study.<br> - I'll never get anywhere if I don't.<br> Anyway, that's not so.<br> We were out last night.<br> - I don't think you like me anymore.<br> - Of course I do.<br> We can't always be playing around.<br> Anyway, what's that got to do with it?<br> I don't know,<br> but you don't act like you used to.<br> - Now I don't seem good enough for you.<br> - You're imagining things.<br> No, I'm not. When you were first here<br> you weren't this way.<br> You've grown tired of me.<br> I was silly enough to believe you<br> when you said you loved me.<br> I said I loved you?<br> Now, Marie, you know that's not so.<br> I never said that.<br> You're just trying to put me in a spot.<br> And you know it wasn't love<br> just as well as I do.<br> So that's the way you feel?<br> You can't make me out cheap<br> and get away with it.<br> I know what I'm talking about, see?<br> And someday you're gonna be sorry.<br> Come in.<br> Well, so you really think you're leaving?<br> I'm moving to a bigger place.<br> I can afford it now.<br> In other words, that means<br> we won't see each other anymore.<br> No, I guess we'll see each other sometime.<br> You don't mean that.<br> Marie, I appreciate all you've done for me,<br> but I couldn't love you.<br> I can't change my feeling towards you<br> any more than...<br> I can change the color of my eyes.<br> I know I'm speaking bluntly, but frankly...<br> this will save us both a lot of misery.<br> And is that your only reason for leaving?<br> - That's a pretty good one, isn't it?<br> - Not very.<br> Of course, when a fellow wants<br> to ditch a girl he'll do most anything...<br> providing it doesn't land him<br> back in the chain gang...<br> where he probably belongs.<br> Here.<br> It's from your brother.<br> - You wouldn't...<br> - I wouldn't tell...<br> if I had a reason to protect you.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I wouldn't tell...<br> if you were my husband.<br> - Well, it means plenty of work.<br> - I'm used to that.<br> Yes. On the other hand,<br> all work and no play...<br> Makes Jack.<br> How about knocking off<br> and having a little recreation?<br> We're giving a party tonight<br> at the Club Chateau.<br> How about joining us?<br> - I'd like to, but...<br> - Fine. And that includes Mrs. James.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I'm not sure that she can come.<br> - I'll ask her.<br> - Right.<br> - Anyway, we'll expect you.<br> - Fine.<br> See you later.<br> Here's the revised budget<br> on the King's Highway Bridge.<br> By the way, while you were out,<br> your wife called.<br> Any message?<br> She won't be home until Wednesday.<br> She's gone to the country with her cousin.<br> I see.<br> She also said her account was overdrawn.<br> About $600.<br> She's got to stop it.<br> The same thing happened last month.<br> All right, make out a check<br> for the amount...<br> and deposit it in her bank<br> when you go to lunch.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Good night, Mr. James.<br> - Good night.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, yourself. Is Marie there?<br> That's funny. Where do you think she is?<br> She had a date with me<br> and she's giving me a stand-up...<br> and it's the first dame<br> that ever gave me a stand-up.<br> You can tell her that Sammy called...<br> and you can tell her where she can go<br> with little Sammy's compliments.<br> Tell her that, will you? And listen...<br> not a word to her husband, understand?<br> - Don't you dance?<br> - Not if I can get out of it.<br> That makes two of us.<br> I don't care much for dancing<br> in such a crowd.<br> - I don't like crowds anywhere.<br> - What do you like to do?<br> Build bridges, roads for people to use...<br> when they want to get away from things.<br> That sounds interesting.<br> But they can't get away. Nobody can.<br> You're a strange person.<br> Don't pay any attention to what I say.<br> You'd like to get away from here<br> right now, wouldn't you?<br> You don't like this party.<br> I like it better now.<br> Well, I was on the verge of sneaking home.<br> I'm not so sure I want to now.<br> We might make a getaway.<br> I don't think they'd miss us. How about it?<br> Come on.<br> Well, here we are.<br> Tell me some more about your work.<br> It sounds fascinating.<br> Why talk about work?<br> That's what interests you, isn't it?<br> No. There are other things<br> that interest me, too.<br> Do you mind if we stay here a while,<br> or must you go home?<br> There are no musts in my life.<br> I'm free, white and 21.<br> - You're lucky.<br> - Why?<br> You can go where you want,<br> when you want.<br> Can't you?<br> Yes. And no.<br> You're a strange, moody person.<br> You need somebody<br> to pull you out of those doldrums.<br> Are you applying for that job?<br> - I might consider it.<br> - You're hired.<br> - When do I start?<br> - You've started, several hours ago.<br> Don't you see, Marie?<br> If you get a divorce,<br> I'll give you anything you want.<br> I swear I will.<br> What's the use of arguing?<br> I told you I was satisfied<br> with the way things are.<br> - Can't you see that neither of us is happy?<br> - I'm happy!<br> I'm taking no chances of letting you go.<br> Listen. You're going to be a big shot<br> some day, with plenty of sugar...<br> and I'm going to ride right along. Get that?<br> I'm no fool.<br> I'd be a sucker to let you go now.<br> But I'm in love with another woman.<br> That's just too bad.<br> Why don't you play the game square?<br> Square? So that you and your sweet<br> mama can give me the grand go-by?<br> Be yourself.<br> If you don't listen to reason,<br> I'll find some way.<br> You do, and you'll serve out your time.<br> It's no worse than serving out my time<br> with you.<br> You'll be sorry you said that!<br> Now, listen.<br> You've held a sword over my head<br> about long enough.<br> It's about time you called it quits.<br> You've been bluffing me, and I've been<br> fool and coward enough to fall for it.<br> You filthy, good-for-nothing convict!<br> A bluff? You'll see.<br> - You'll see.<br> - Put that down.<br> - Give me the police station.<br> - Put that down!<br> You don't think you'll stop me, do you,<br> now that I've made up my mind?<br> We'll only take a minute of your time,<br> Mr. James.<br> In view of your marvelous achievement<br> on the new Stevens Bridge...<br> the Chamber of Commerce would like you<br> as their principal speaker at their banquet.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I feel highly complimented.<br> There's two detectives coming through,<br> Mr. James.<br> I told them you were busy<br> but they wouldn't wait.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.<br> Mr. James or Mr. Allen<br> or whatever your name is...<br> I have a warrant for your arrest.<br> - And we can quote you literally?<br> - Certainly.<br> Everything I've said are facts.<br> I want this rotten<br> chain-gang system exposed.<br> Print it all!<br> How about a special signed story<br> for our Sunday supplement?<br> Sure, I'll write it. Gladly.<br> How long were you<br> on the chain gang before, Mr. Allen?<br> Governor Baxter has not yet<br> signed the extradition papers.<br> Until he does, I cannot turn Mr. Allen<br> over to the custody of your state.<br> In view of Allen's record here<br> since his escape...<br> our state has authorized us<br> to assure you...<br> that if he'll return voluntarily...<br> and pay the state<br> the expense it's been put to...<br> he'll be pardoned in 90 days.<br> Why is it necessary<br> for my client to return at all?<br> Why mete out punishment to a man<br> who has proven himself a useful...<br> and honorable citizen?<br> Merely a technicality.<br> No prisoner is eligible for pardon<br> until he's served 90 days.<br> Does that mean<br> that I'll have to serve 90 days?<br> - Back on the chain gang?<br> - No.<br> You'll be given some clerical job<br> in one of the camps.<br> Well, it rests entirely with my client...<br> but I'd advise him to stay right here.<br> Gentlemen, there's someone else<br> I'd like to consult on the matter...<br> - if you don't mind.<br> - Certainly.<br> They've promised me a full pardon<br> within 90 days if I go back.<br> Can you trust them?<br> I don't see why not.<br> I'm giving myself up voluntarily.<br> Besides, I want to get it<br> all cleaned up now...<br> so that nothing will stand in the way<br> of our happiness.<br> I think it best, darling.<br> Why, they can't fail to pardon you.<br> And then, when you come back,<br> you'll be free. For always.<br> And we'll be together. Always.<br> These stories you've been hearing,<br> gentlemen, are absurd.<br> Why, our chain gangs are beneficial<br> to the convicts...<br> not only physically, but morally.<br> I can cite you...<br> Gentlemen, I've decided to go back.<br> Voluntarily.<br> On your assurance of a pardon.<br> And you won't regret your decision.<br> I presume, Mr. Allen,<br> your Chicago attorneys informed you...<br> that I would be in complete charge<br> of your case down here?<br> Yes, he did.<br> Let's get the financial end<br> straightened out first.<br> Your capture and return cost the state...<br> $350. My fee will be $2,500.<br> $1,000 now,<br> and $1,500 when you get your release.<br> This is for the state.<br> You know, of course...<br> that you'll have to go to a prison camp<br> for 90 days.<br> - There's your check.<br> - Thanks, Allen.<br> There's no reason to believe<br> that after the 90 days...<br> I won't get my pardon then, is there?<br> This is a funny state<br> and the Governor's a little peculiar.<br> You see, all that publicity you gave out<br> about the conditions here...<br> didn't help any.<br> But I'll get my pardon?<br> They'll give you the pardon.<br> But that clerical job they promised you<br> isn't so definite.<br> They might want you to work<br> for about 60 days.<br> This is the guy<br> that all that fuss was about.<br> And if he tries to escape this time,<br> shoot him!<br> Escape? I'm supposed to be a trustee here.<br> Haven't you had orders<br> from the Prison Commission?<br> Sure, I got orders...<br> that if you get away from here this time,<br> I lose my job.<br> And that goes for all of you. Get me?<br> - Now take him out of here.<br> - Come on.<br> Go on. Find yourself a bunk.<br> Go on down the line.<br> How did you get<br> to this little bit of heaven, kid?<br> It's a long story.<br> Sit down, make yourself at home.<br> If you can.<br> Boy, if you think<br> those other chain gangs are tough...<br> wait till you get a load of this joint.<br> These are the guys that were too tough<br> for the chain gangs.<br> Now give us the story.<br> How'd they snatch you back?<br> They didn't. I came back.<br> He just got lonesome.<br> They promised me a pardon<br> if I'd come back for 90 days.<br> What's a pardon?<br> These boys up here<br> ain't never heard that word.<br> Neither has the Prison Commission.<br> What'd you do<br> to get sent up here, Bomber?<br> I decided to hang it on the limb,<br> so I socked a guard with a sledge.<br> I aimed at the rat's head, but I missed.<br> I can't figure<br> a guy walking back into this...<br> just because they promised to spring him<br> in 90 days.<br> They just wanna make it tough on me,<br> I guess.<br> But I'll get the pardon, all right...<br> Listen, kid, they ain't thinking of handing<br> out pardons when you land in here.<br> This is the last word.<br> You might say it's "it."<br> Come on, get to work down there!<br> The case of James Allen.<br> - Is Mr. Ramsey present?<br> - Ready, Your Honor.<br> Please be brief. We have a great many<br> of these cases this afternoon.<br> I should first like to introduce...<br> the convict's brother,<br> the Rev. Robert Allen.<br> Your Honor...<br> I shall leave the legal technicalities<br> of the case to Mr. Ramsey...<br> and shall present the story of James Allen<br> as a human being.<br> A man of essential fineness<br> and integrity of character.<br> A man who was decorated for bravery<br> in the World War.<br> A man who committed a crime...<br> but only when forced to<br> at the point of a gun.<br> His first and only offence.<br> A man who showed his true character<br> by rising from less than nothing...<br> to become a prominent<br> and honored citizen.<br> ...and in conclusion,<br> I need not remind you...<br> that James Allen has kept<br> his part of the bargain.<br> He has returned voluntarily to this state...<br> and has paid<br> all the expenses demanded of him.<br> I cannot believe,<br> in the light of all this evidence...<br> and in the name of justice...<br> that you will bring yourselves<br> even to consider any other alternative.<br> First, I feel it is my duty...<br> to answer the malicious and unwarranted<br> attack upon the chain-gang system...<br> which we have heard here this afternoon.<br> Crime must be punished.<br> The men who commit crime<br> are hard men...<br> and their punishments must be hard.<br> But the brutality of which we hear<br> is a gross exaggeration...<br> born of the fancy of the misinformed.<br> The life of a convict in a chain gang<br> is one of hard labor.<br> The discipline is strict...<br> but there is no brutality.<br> The purpose of prison<br> is not only to punish crime...<br> but to discourage it.<br> And there is less crime in this state...<br> in proportion to her population...<br> than in 40 other states in this Union.<br> Finally, as evidence<br> of the chain gang's value...<br> as a character-builder,<br> I have but to present to you...<br> the very case that has been presented<br> to us here today...<br> the case of James Allen...<br> who entered the chain gang<br> as a worthless tramp...<br> and who left it<br> to become one of a great city's...<br> most worthy and respected citizens.<br> The Commission will take the case<br> of James Allen under consideration.<br> Five minutes, Allen.<br> They refused to pardon you.<br> They refused?<br> The state's promise didn't mean anything.<br> It was all lies!<br> They just wanted to get me back...<br> so they can have their revenge.<br> To keep me here nine more years!<br> Why, their crimes are worse than mine.<br> Worse than anybody here!<br> They're the ones that should be in chains,<br> not me!<br> You don't have to stay here nine years.<br> The Commission voted that if you were<br> a model prisoner for one year...<br> they would concede that you had paid<br> your obligations in full.<br> It's only nine months, Jim.<br> Nine months of this torture?<br> I won't do it!<br> I won't do it, I tell you!<br> I'll get out of here!<br> Even if they kill me for it!<br> It's still better to be honorably free.<br> And in those nine months,<br> we'll be working for you night and day.<br> But you've been working night and day!<br> It didn't do any good.<br> But, Jim, we'll have the whole country<br> behind you then...<br> and the state will be forced to release you.<br> All right.<br> I'll wait nine more months.<br> I'll be a model prisoner...<br> if it kills me.<br> Finally, not only has James Allen<br> been a model prisoner...<br> patient and uncomplaining<br> for a whole year...<br> but we have presented letters<br> from countless organizations...<br> and prominent individuals...<br> beseeching you to recommend his pardon.<br> I think it only just, Your Honors...<br> that he be given his freedom<br> while there is still time...<br> for him to regain<br> his former position in society...<br> of prominence and universal respect.<br> We've just had a final report<br> on your new hearing.<br> Well?<br> They've suspended decision. Indefinitely.<br> - Which one did you say it was?<br> - This one here.<br> Get up, you lazy skunk!<br> - Driver!<br> - What's on your mind?<br> - You better come take a look back here.<br> - I gotta get to the quarry.<br> You'll never make the quarry in this truck.<br> Your spring's broken.<br> Spring's broken?<br> - Where?<br> - There it is.<br> Thief! He's stealing my truck!<br> Stay where you are!<br> Keep driving, boy.<br> Throw that box out.<br> Nix, it's full of my favorite candy.<br> We're making it, Jim.<br> We'll make it yet.<br> Rip it, boy. Go on.<br> Keep going, kid.<br> That's once I didn't miss.<br> Getting out here.<br> Helen.<br> Jim!<br> - Why haven't you come before?<br> - I couldn't.<br> - I was afraid to.<br> - But you could have written.<br> It's been almost a year since you escaped.<br> But I haven't escaped.<br> They're still after me.<br> They'll always be after me.<br> I've had jobs, but I can't keep them.<br> Something happens, someone turns up.<br> I hide in rooms all day and travel by night.<br> No friends, no rest, no peace.<br> - Oh, Jim!<br> - Keep moving, that's all that's left for me.<br> Forgive me, Helen.<br> I had to take a chance to see you tonight.<br> Just to say goodbye.<br> - It was all going to be so different.<br> - It is different.<br> They've made it different.<br> I've got to go.<br> I can't let you go like this.<br> Can't you tell me where you're going?<br> Will you write? Do you need any money?<br> But you must, Jim. How do you live?<br> I steal.<br> SkyFury<br>
