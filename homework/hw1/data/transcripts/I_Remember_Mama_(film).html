If Martha thinks she'll<br> get the warm coat she always talks about...<br> ...out of that old broken-down actor...<br> - Jenny, Mr. Hyde is a gentleman.<br> He reads to us loud wonderful books.<br> Longfellow and Charles Dickens<br> and Fenimore Kipling.<br> Oh, come. Come in, Trina.<br> Come. Coffee's getting cold.<br> - I tell them.<br> - Why did you come to Martha first?<br> She think maybe<br> Martha would understand.<br> Maybe Mr. Thorkelson thinks<br> she will have dowry...<br> ...like the girls in the old country.<br> - Sigrid.<br> Well, why shouldn't I?<br> You all had dowries.<br> We were married in Norway,<br> and our parents were alive.<br> Where would your dowry<br> come from, I'd like to know?<br> - Uncle Chris. He's head of the family.<br> - And who will ask him?<br> He won't need asking<br> when Mr. Thorkelson...<br> Uncle Chris will eat him.<br> Timid Peter and Uncle Chris.<br> Maybe Uncle Chris will tell<br> him some family stories.<br> He knows many, does Uncle Chris.<br> - Where are the children?<br> - Yes, aren't we going to see them?<br> Yeah, sure. I'll call them.<br> - Children! Your aunts are leaving!<br> - Coming, Papa.<br> I help with the coffee things.<br> Is all right.<br> Here they come.<br> Good evening, Aunt Jenny, Aunt Sigrid.<br> Good evening. Where have you all been<br> hiding yourselves?<br> - Good evening, Nels.<br> - Good evening.<br> My, my, my, how tall he's getting.<br> Yeah, he's almost as tall as his Papa.<br> Looks to me as if he's<br> outgrowing his strength.<br> Dagmar is looking pale too.<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> What an awful-looking cat!<br> - She follows Dagmar everywhere.<br> - Next, she'll have it sleeping with her.<br> Don't you know a cat draws breath<br> from a sleeping child?<br> You wouldn't want to wake up<br> smothered, would you?<br> Elizabeth can have all my breath.<br> - There.<br> - Elizabeth.<br> - What a very silly name for a cat.<br> - It's a very silly name for that cat.<br> - That cat's a tom...<br> - Nels, you do not need to say it.<br> She better think up a new name.<br> He's Elizabeth, and he's gonna<br> stay Elizabeth.<br> Well, maybe you would call him<br> Uncle Elizabeth.<br> Uncle Elizabeth?<br> - Elizabeth, do you hear?<br> - Goodbye, all.<br> - Come on, sweetheart.<br> - You're called Uncle Elizabeth now.<br> Nels, go tell Mr. Hyde<br> we're ready for the reading.<br> You mind what I say, Martha.<br> It'd be a great pity if a boarder put<br> something over on a Norwegian woman.<br> Would be great pity if boarder put<br> something over on San Francisco woman.<br> You talk as if San Francisco<br> were the world.<br> Yeah, is my world.<br> Goodbye, Jenny, Sigrid.<br> - Goodbye, Martha.<br> - Goodbye, Aunt Martha.<br> Goodbye, Arne, sweetheart.<br> Oh, Mr. Hyde, this is my sister Trina.<br> Enchanted.<br> Mr. Hyde reads to us tonight<br> the Tales From Two Cities.<br> It's a beautiful story, but sad.<br> I like sad stories.<br> I should like to finish this tonight.<br> Is good.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - Yes, please, Mr. Hyde.<br> Yeah, Mr. Hyde.<br> "In the black prison of the Conciergerie...<br> ...the doomed of the day awaited their fate.<br> They were in numbers<br> the weeks of the year.<br> Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon<br> on the life-tide of the city...<br> ...to the boundless everlasting sea."<br> I don't think I shall ever<br> forget that night.<br> It was almost midnight<br> when he came to the end...<br> ...and none of us had noticed.<br> "It is a far, far better thing I do...<br> ...than I have ever done.<br> It is a far, far better rest I go to...<br> ...than I have ever known."<br> The end.<br> There were many nights<br> I couldn't sleep...<br> ...for the way Mr. Hyde had<br> set my imagination dancing.<br> I wrote in my diary, "What a<br> wonderful thing is literature...<br> ...transporting us to realms unknown. "<br> "His voice sank almost<br> to a whisper as he answered."<br> "'Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints...<br> ...of a gigantic hound."'<br> To be continued in our next.<br> - Lf you're interested.<br> - Oh, yes, Mr. Hyde.<br> If we were interested? You couldn't<br> have kept us from it.<br> It meant a lot to Mama too,<br> because Nels stopped going nights...<br> ...to the street corner to hang about<br> with the neighborhood boys.<br> The night they broke<br> into Mr. Dillon's store...<br> ...Nels was home with us.<br> This above all: to thine own self be true.<br> And it must follow, as the night the day...<br> ...thou canst not then be false to any man.<br> The more Mr. Hyde read,<br> the more I realized...<br> ...that the one thing I really wanted<br> in all the world was to become a writer.<br> I did write a piece once<br> about Mama's Uncle Chris...<br> ...but my schoolteacher said<br> it wasn't nice to write...<br> ...about a member of one's own family.<br> Once or twice a year...<br> ...our Uncle Chris, with his great,<br> loud voice...<br> ...with his fierce black mustache...<br> ...would come down<br> from his ranch in the north...<br> ...and descend upon San Francisco<br> in his automobile.<br> We knew that from the time<br> he roared off the ferry...<br> ...and charged up Market Street<br> to get a good run up the hill...<br> ...our quiet way of life<br> was due for a change.<br> Uncle Chris.<br> Uncle Chris.<br> We children didn't talk much about him...<br> ...but Mama used to say that the reason<br> Uncle Chris drove so fast...<br> ...was that it gave him a feeling of<br> freedom denied him when he walked.<br> For Uncle Chris limped badly because<br> of an accident back in the old country.<br> Martha!<br> Lars! Children, where are you?<br> Martha!

Can't you<br> see that Mama's heart is breaking?<br> You're always trying to make<br> everything so dramatic.<br> You only make things worse for Mama.<br> Well, it is dramatic.<br> - People's hearts don't actually break.<br> - They do.<br> Only in books.<br> Mama.<br> What are you going to do?<br> Scrub the floor.<br> But, Mama, you scrubbed<br> the floor yesterday.<br> Yeah, well, I scrub it again.<br> But, Mama.<br> Comes a time when you got<br> to get down on your knees.<br> Now will you believe me?<br> Mama, I wish you wouldn't do this.<br> You must be tired.<br> Let her alone, Nels.<br> Mama.<br> Mama.<br> What is it, Mama?<br> What is it?<br> I think of something.<br> I think I think of something.<br> "And drank real dew out of a crystal goblet.<br> And helped the stars to play peekaboo."<br> Uncle Chris?<br> - Yes, Arne?<br> - Does it have to hurt like this?<br> If you want it to be well...<br> ...and not walk always like Uncle Chris,<br> it does, for little.<br> Arne, the doctor give you something...<br> ...to make you go to sleep.<br> So maybe if you don't think of pain,<br> you go to sleep.<br> Is very bad?<br> It is, kind of.<br> Arne?<br> Don't you know any swear words?<br> What?<br> Don't you know any swear words?<br> No, Uncle Chris.

Teaching a child to swear.<br> You don't know<br> what "dum geit" means, eh?<br> Do I look like a foreigner?<br> If you were, you would know<br> that "dum geit" in Norwegian means:<br> "Stupid old goat."<br> Is different one.<br> You're working late, aren't you?<br> The floors need cleaning.<br> I'm glad they finally decided<br> to clean them.<br> Yeah.<br> Mama.<br> Mama.<br> Mama.<br> Mama.<br> Mama.<br> Dagmar.<br> Is Mama, Dagmar.<br> Mama.<br> There's no fever.<br> Is good.<br> Where you been?

It's morning.<br> Well, maybe it's good for her<br> to think that that cat died by itself.<br> We cannot tell her lies.<br> My, what a funny smell.<br> It's like it was in the hospital.<br> I'll take care of you, Elizabeth,<br> the way the nurses took care of me.<br> You'll soon be the wellest cat<br> in all of San Francisco.<br> My goodness, you put<br> enough blankets on him.<br> Did you think he'd catch cold?<br> Mama, look.<br> Dagmar, let me see.<br> Let me see that cat.<br> Here.<br> Uncle Elizabeth speak to me.<br> It's a miracle.<br> Oh, Mama, I knew you'd make him well.<br> - Oh, but, Dagmar...<br> - I'm gonna take him and show him to Nels.<br> Dagmar, I didn't...<br> Nels, Christine, look what Mama did!<br> You didn't give him enough.<br> You just give him good sleep.<br> But Lars, we must tell her.<br> Is not good to let her grow up<br> believing I can fix everything.<br> Maybe is best thing in the world<br> for her to believe.<br> Besides, I know exactly how she feels.<br> At the time, it seemed like ages.<br> But now I know that<br> the days and months...<br> ...went by too fast while we were<br> growing up and learning.<br> Graduation day assumed<br> monumental proportions.<br> Especially because I was to play Portia...<br> ...in the school production<br> of The Merchant of Venice.<br> The quality of mercy is not strained.<br> It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven...<br> ...upon the place beneath.<br> It is twice blest.<br> It blesseth him that gives<br> and him that takes.<br> Him that takes.<br> "It blesseth him that gives and him<br> that takes." What's after that?<br> - I don't know or care.<br> - Why, Chris.<br> I don't. It's all I've heard for weeks.<br> The school play and your graduation,<br> going on to high...<br> ...never a thought about home. All you<br> and your friends think about...<br> ...is the presents you'll get.<br> You make me ashamed of being a girl.<br> Have you heard about<br> Thyra's graduation present?<br> - Hello, Katrin.<br> - Hello, Madeline.<br> - What are you getting?<br> - Well, they haven't actually told me...<br> ...but I think I'm going to get that.<br> You mean the dresser set?<br> Your father took it out<br> so I could touch it.<br> It's got everything.<br> Even a hair receiver.<br> And it's genuine celluloid.<br> - Well, you're not gonna get it.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Because I know what you are getting.<br> - What is it?<br> Mama's giving you her brooch.<br> Her solje.<br> That old silver thing she wears<br> that belonged to grandmother?<br> What would I want<br> with an old thing like that for?<br> It's an heirloom.<br> Mama thinks a lot of it.<br> Then she ought to keep it.<br> That's all they're going to give me?<br> - What more do you want?<br> - I want the dresser set.<br> My goodness, if Mama doesn't realize<br> what's a suitable present...<br> It's practically the most important<br> time in a girl's life, when she graduates.<br> - And you say you're not selfish.<br> - It's not selfishness.<br> What else would you call it?<br> With Papa not working,<br> we need every penny we can get.<br> Even the little bank's empty.<br> But you'll devil Mama into giving you<br> the dresser set somehow.<br> So why talk about it?<br> Walk faster if you're<br> going to walk with me.<br> Christine was right.<br> I got the dresser set.<br> They gave it to me toward the end<br> of supper on graduation night.<br> Papa couldn't attend the exercises<br> because there was a strike meeting...<br> ...to decide about going back to work.<br> - I'll start the dishes, Mama.<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> We can wash them<br> when we come home.<br> Katrin, why you don't<br> eat your rice pudding?<br> Mama, I couldn't eat. Not now.<br> Who wants some coffee sugar? Dagmar?<br> Thank you, Papa.<br> Katrin?<br> No, Papa.<br> Katrin, get your coat. You'll need it.<br> Yes, Mama.<br> Aunt Jenny says if we drink<br> black coffee...<br> ...it turn our complexions dark.<br> I'd like to be a black Norwegian<br> like Uncle Chris.<br> I like you better blond, like Mama is.<br> When do you get old enough<br> to drink coffee and not turn dark?<br> Well, one day when you're grown up.<br> It's the most wonderful<br> night in my life.<br> Is that black coffee<br> you dip that sugar in?<br> You shouldn't. It's not good for them.<br> It will turn...<br> It will turn your complexion black.<br> Aunt Jenny, did you<br> see my graduation present?<br> Look, it's got a hair receiver.<br> But I thought... Martha.<br> - Yeah, Jenny, you were right.<br> - I thought you were...<br> She's too young to appreciate that.<br> She likes something more modern.<br> You're not wearing your solje.<br> No, I do not wear it tonight.<br> - Come on, Trina, we'll be late.<br> - Oh, but Peter isn't here yet.<br> - You like to wait for him?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I hope Katrin knows her part.<br> - She sure does. I know it too.<br> Lars, you be back before us?<br> - I don't think the meeting will take that long.<br> - Is good. All right, now we go.<br> Katrin, come.<br> - Goodbye, Papa.<br> - My daughter, I think of you.<br> - See you there, Aunt Trina.<br> - Good luck!<br> I knew you would devil Mama<br> into giving it to you.<br> I didn't.<br> I showed it to her in<br> Mr. Schiller's window.<br> And made her sell her brooch<br> her very own mother gave her.<br> - What?<br> - You weren't supposed to tell that.<br> I don't care. I think<br> she ought to know.<br> Is that true? Did Mama...?<br> - Nels?<br> - Well, yes.<br> - Come on.<br> - No, I don't believe it.<br> - I'm going to ask Papa.<br> - You haven't got time.<br> I don't care.<br> Well, I hope you're satisfied.<br> Papa! Papa!<br> Christine said...<br> Papa, did Mama sell<br> her brooch to give me this?<br> Well, Christine shouldn't have<br> told you that.<br> It's true, then.<br> Well, she didn't sell it. She traded<br> it to Mr. Schiller for your present.<br> Oh, but she shouldn't...<br> - I never meant...<br> - But, look, Katrin...<br> ...you wanted your present,<br> and Mama wanted your happiness.<br> Well, she wanted that more<br> than she wanted that brooch.<br> But I never meant her to do that.<br> She loved it so.<br> It was all she had of Grandmother's.<br> But she always meant<br> it for you, Katrin...<br> ...and you mustn't cry.<br> You have your play to act.<br> I don't want to act in it now.<br> - But you must. Your audience is waiting.<br> - I don't care.<br> But you must care.<br> Now, look, Katrin...<br> ...tonight you are not Katrin any longer.<br> Tonight you are an actress,<br> and an actress must act...<br> ...whatever she is feeling.<br> There's an old saying that says:<br> - The...<br> - The mails must go through!<br> The mail...<br> The show must go on.<br> Now, you stop crying and go back<br> and act your play.<br> We'll talk of this later. Afterwards.<br> All right.<br> I'll go.<br> I'm worried about her, Lars.<br> She was not good in the play tonight.<br> I've heard her practice it here.<br> She was good.<br> But tonight...<br> I don't know. She was not good.<br> Look, Martha, tonight after you leave...<br> ...Katrin found out about your brooch.<br> - My brooch?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How? Who told her?<br> Christine.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know.<br> Christine!<br> Christine!<br> Yes, Mama?<br> Did you tell Katrin tonight<br> about my brooch?<br> Yes.<br> Why did you?<br> Because I hated the smug way she was<br> acting about that dresser set.<br> Is no excuse. You make her unhappy.<br> You make her not good in the play.<br> Well, she made you unhappy,<br> giving up your brooch...<br> Is not your business.<br> I choose to give my brooch.<br> Is not you to judge. You know<br> I do not want you to tell.<br> I'm angry with you, Christine.<br> I'm sorry.<br> But I'm not sorry I told.<br> Christine is the stubborn one.<br> Come on, Katrin, it's all right.<br> What happened at the meeting tonight?<br> Oh, we go back to work<br> tomorrow morning.<br> That's bully, isn't it, Mama?<br> Yeah, is good.<br> Here's your brooch, Mama.<br> I'm sorry I was so bad in the play.<br> I'll go help Christine with the dishes.<br> Mr. Schiller give it back to her?<br> We went to his house to get it.<br> He didn't want to, but Katrin<br> begged and begged him.<br> And the dresser set,<br> she give that back?<br> It was awful hard<br> for her to do, Mama.<br> She's a good kid.<br> Good night. I gotta get up early.<br> - Good night, Nels.<br> - Good night, Papa.<br> - Good night, Nels.<br> - Good night, Mama.<br> Nels is the kind one.<br> Katrin.<br> Katrin.<br> Katrin, come here.<br> You put this on.<br> No, it's yours.<br> It is your graduation present.<br> I put it on for you.<br> I'll wear it always.<br> I'll keep it forever.<br> Christine should not have told you.<br> I'm glad she did now.<br> I'm glad too.<br> Good night, Christine.<br> Good night, Mama.<br> Good night, Papa.<br> Good night, baby.<br> Good night, Katrin.<br> Good night, Christine.<br> Katrin.<br> I'm sorry, Papa.<br> I just don't feel like it.<br> Katrin.<br> For me?<br> For our grown-up daughter.<br> - Katrin is the dramatic one.<br> - Yeah.<br> Is too bad. Her first cup of coffee,<br> and she doesn't drink it.<br> It would not have been good<br> for her so late at night.<br> Lars, you drink it.<br> We do not wanna waste it.<br> And you, Martha, are the practical one.<br> There is a time for everything.<br> A time for being born<br> and a time for coming of age...<br> ...and there is a time for death too.<br> I remember when the telegram arrived.<br> - Jenny! Uncle Chris is dying!<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - He's too mean to die, ever!<br> - I cannot stop to argue.<br> There's a train at 1 1:00.<br> It take four hours.<br> You call Sigrid and Trina!<br> When Mama told me I was to go with her,<br> I was thrilled...<br> ...and I was frightened.<br> It was exciting taking<br> sandwiches on the train...<br> ...as though we were going on a picnic.<br> But I was scared at the idea<br> of seeing death.<br> Although I told myself<br> that if I were going to write...<br> ...I'd have to experience everything.<br> But, even so, I hoped it would<br> all be over when we got there.<br> It was afternoon when we arrived.<br> The ranch was about<br> three miles from the town...<br> ...a rambling, derelict old place.<br> There were wide fields and tall trees<br> and the smell of honeysuckle.<br> The woman came out<br> on the steps to meet us.<br> How is he? Is he...?<br> Come in, won't you?<br> I want more.<br> Give me more.<br> There's still some in the bottle.<br> Uncle Chris, that will not help now.<br> It always help. Now especially.<br> Uncle Chris, I don't think you realize...<br> What don't I realize?<br> That I'm dying?<br> Why else do I think you come here?<br> Why else do I think you<br> stand there watching me?<br> Get out.<br> Get out. I don't want you here.<br> Oh, very well. Very well. We be outside<br> on the porch if you want us.<br> That is where I want you, on the porch.<br> Oh, wait. That is Arne. Come here, Arne.<br> How is your knee?<br> It... It's fine, Uncle Chris.<br> Does not hurt anymore?<br> No.<br> You don't say "dum geit" anymore?<br> No, Uncle Chris.<br> You walk good?<br> - Quite good?<br> - Yes.<br> Is good.<br> - Uncle Chris, Arne has always been...<br> - I tell you all to get out!<br> Except Martha.<br> Katrin.<br> Katrin can stay. She and I have secret.<br> Do you remember?<br> Yes, Uncle Chris.<br> Uncle Chris, what are you doing?<br> You must lie down again.<br> - Why didn't you give me drink?<br> - No, Uncle Chris.<br> We cannot waste what is left<br> in the bottle!<br> You do not drink it.<br> Who will drink it when I'm gone?<br> What harm can it do now? I die anyway.<br> You give it me.<br> All right. I give you drink.<br> You lie down again.<br> - Martha.<br> - Yeah.<br> You sell this ranch and give<br> the money to Jessie.<br> Jessie?<br> Jessie Brown, my housekeeper.<br> No. Why do I call her that to you?<br> She is my wife.<br> For several years, she has been my wife.<br> She used to have husband<br> in asylum in Stockton...<br> ...but when he die, we get married.<br> Only I do not tell the aunts.<br> They snub her before.<br> So...<br> - I play fine joke on them.<br> - Yeah.<br> But there is no money for you, Martha.<br> Always I wanted there should be<br> money to make Nels doctor.<br> But there were other things.<br> Quick things.<br> And now there is no time to make more.<br> There is no money.<br> But you make Nels doctor all the same.<br> - You like?<br> - Yeah, sure, Uncle Chris.<br> Is what Lars and I have always<br> wanted for him.<br> To help people who suffer.<br> Is greatest thing in world.<br> It is to have little of God in you.<br> Where is Jessie?<br> I think she wait outside, Uncle Chris.<br> You call her.<br> I like you both be here.<br> Oh, Katrin.<br> Your mama write me<br> you drink coffee now?<br> Katrin, who will be writer.<br> You're not frightened of me now.<br> No, Uncle Chris.<br> One day maybe you write story<br> from Uncle Chris.<br> If you remember.<br> I'll remember.<br> I think best maybe<br> Katrin go away now.<br> Farvel, Katrin.<br> Goodbye, Uncle Chris.<br> You say it in Norwegian, like I do?<br> Farvel, Uncle Chris.<br> Maybe I should introduce<br> you to each other.<br> Jessie...<br> ...this is my niece, Martha.<br> The only one of my nieces I can stand.<br> Martha...<br> ...this is my wife, Jessie...<br> ...who has given me much happiness.<br> I'm very glad to meet you.<br> - I am too, Martha.<br> - Is good.<br> And now...<br> ...you give me one more drink.<br> You have drink with me, both of you.<br> That way, we finish the bottle.<br> Yes?<br> Yeah, sure, Uncle Chris.<br> Jessie, you get best glasses.<br> What is the time?<br> Is about half past 4, Uncle Chris.<br> The sun come around this side<br> the house in afternoon.<br> I pull the shade.<br> No!

Did he say anything<br> about a will?<br> There's no will.<br> Well, then, that means...<br> We're his nearest relatives.<br> - There is no money either.<br> - How do you know?<br> He told me.<br> What's that?<br> Is an account of how he<br> spent the money.<br> Bills from a saloon.<br> No, Jenny.<br> No.<br> I read it to you.<br> You know how Uncle Chris was lame,<br> how he walked always with limp.<br> It was his one thought. Lame people.<br> He would have liked<br> to be doctor and help them.<br> Instead, he...<br> He help in other ways.<br> I read you the last page.<br> "Joseph Spinelli, 4 year old...<br> ...tubercular left leg, $337.1 8.<br> Walks now.<br> Esther Jensen, 9 year.<br> Club foot, $21 7.50.<br> Walks now.<br> - Arne Solfeldt."<br> - My Arne?<br> "Nine year.<br> Fractured kneecap...<br> ...$442.1 6."<br> Mother.<br> When do we eat?<br> What is it?<br> Is Uncle Chris...?<br> I like to write "walks now."

He's asleep.<br> - Trina.<br> - Yeah.<br> Do you know what next Thursday is?<br> Our anniversary.<br> What would you think<br> of our giving a little party?<br> I think it is time you took your place<br> in society.<br> Well, what would you say<br> to ice cream and cookies for the ladies?<br> And coffee, of course.<br> Perhaps port wine for the gentlemen.<br> - Port wine?<br> - Just a little.<br> You could bring it in already<br> poured out in little glasses.<br> And Jenny or Sigrid could<br> help me serve the ice cream.<br> No.<br> You will have someone in<br> to help you in the kitchen.<br> You mean a waitress?<br> Oh, Peter. But none of us have ever...<br> You don't really think...<br> Oh, no.<br> Trina...<br> ...there is something<br> I would like to tell you.<br> I am not very good<br> at expressing myself...<br> ...or my deeper feelings.<br> But...<br> ...I want you to know...<br> ...that I am not only very fond of you...<br> ...but I'm very proud of you as well.<br> And l... I want you to have the best<br> of everything...<br> ...as far as it is in my power<br> to give it to you.<br> I want you to have a waitress.<br> Oh, Peter.<br> Papa was working steadily now,<br> and the little bank was fuller...<br> ...than it had ever been, but the old<br> and thrifty ways continued.<br> I've just decided something.<br> What have you decided?<br> If Nels is gonna be a doctor, when I<br> grow up, I'm gonna be a veterinarian.<br> I remember one afternoon...<br> ...when I was going out<br> to shop for Mama.<br> - Goodbye, everybody.<br> - Goodbye.<br> A horse doctor? Goodbye, Katrin.<br> There are more animals in the world<br> than there are human beings...<br> ...and more human doctors<br> than there are animal ones.<br> It isn't fair, Mama.<br> I don't suppose we can have a horse,<br> can we, Papa?<br> - Maybe a pony?<br> - A pony?<br> Dagmar, what are you going to do<br> when the pony grows up to be a horse?<br> Oh, I never thought of that yet.<br> - What is it?<br> - Mama...<br> ...l'm not going to college.<br> And why not?<br> Because it'd be a waste of money.<br> The point of my going to college...<br> ...was to be a writer.<br> - Well, I'm not going to be one.<br> - Katrin. Is your letter makes you say this?<br> Has a story come back again?<br> This is the tenth time.<br> - It's the best I've ever written.<br> - What your teacher say about this?<br> Teachers don't know<br> anything about writing.<br> They just know about literature.<br> Say... Say, Katrin, last night,<br> I read an article in the newspapers.<br> I saved it for you.<br> You know, my eye just caught<br> a headline. It says...<br> Oh, here it is.<br> It says, "Woman writer tells key<br> to literary success."<br> - Who?<br> - Is a lady called...<br> - Where is everybody?<br> ...Florence Dana Moorhead.<br> - Lars, the spread.<br> - All right, Mama.<br> - "Florence Dana..."<br> - What's going on here?<br> - Nothing.<br> - It gives her picture here.<br> Did you ever hear of her?<br> Yes, of course. Everyone has.<br> - She's terribly successful.<br> - What does she say is the secret?<br> Well, she say... Katrin,<br> you better read it. Here.<br> Look.<br> "Florence Dana Moorhead, celebrated<br> novelist and short-story writer..."<br> Blah, blah, blah.<br> "Interviewed today in her suite<br> at the Fairmont."<br> Blah, blah.<br> "Pronounced sincerity the one essential<br> quality for success as a writer."<br> A lot of help that is.<br> If you sent your stories to this lady...<br> ...maybe she'd tell you<br> what's wrong with them.<br> - Oh, Mama, don't be silly.<br> - Well, why is silly?<br> In the first place, she's a very<br> important person, a celebrity.<br> And she'd never read them.<br> In the second place, you seem to think<br> that writing's like...<br> ...well, like cooking or something,<br> that you just need a recipe.<br> It takes a lot more.<br> You've got to have the gift for it.<br> You have to have the gift<br> for cooking too.<br> But there are things you must learn...<br> ...even if you have the gift.<br> Well, that's the whole point.<br> I haven't.<br> I know now.<br> So, Papa, if you're through<br> with the paper...<br> ...l'll take the want-ad section,<br> see if I can find myself a job.<br> This lady in the paper,<br> what else does she say, Nels?<br> Well, not much.<br> The rest seems to be<br> about her and her home.<br> "Apart from literature, Mrs. Moorhead's<br> main interest in life is gastronomy."<br> Gastronomy. The stars.<br> No, eating. "A brilliant cook herself,<br> she says that she would as soon...<br> ...turn out a good souffle<br> as a short story.<br> Or find a new recipe<br> as she would a first edition."<br> Mama, I'll go see if I have<br> any puppies yet.<br> Yeah.<br> Let's see her picture.<br> Is kind face.<br> What is "first edition"?<br> - Christine, look.<br> - What, Dagmar?<br> - I've got puppies!<br> - How many?<br> We'll see. What will I call them?<br> Are you coming?<br> Don't name them anything<br> till I get there.<br> Ms. Moorhead.<br> Calling Ms. Moorhead.<br> Ms. Moorhead.<br> Calling Ms. Moorhead.<br> - Call for Ms. Moorhead.<br> - Yes?<br> Ms. Moorhead?<br> - Ms. Florence Dana Moorhead?<br> - Yes?<br> Could I speak to you, please?<br> Yes. What's it about?<br> I read in the paper<br> what you say about writing.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - My daughter Katrin wants to be writer.<br> Oh, really?<br> - I bring her stories.<br> - Look, I'm afraid I'm in a hurry.<br> - I'm leaving San Francisco this evening.<br> - But if I could talk...<br> ...for just two minute. That's all.<br> - I've had to make it a rule...<br> ...never to read anyone's<br> unpublished material.<br> It said that you like to collect<br> recipes for eating.<br> Yes, I've written<br> several books on cooking.<br> l, too, am interested in gastronomy.<br> I am good cook. Norwegian.<br> I make good Norwegian dishes.<br> Lutefisk and koettbullar...<br> ...that's meatballs with cream sauce.<br> - I know. I've eaten them in Christiania.<br> My mother give me<br> special recipe for koettbullar.<br> She was best cook I ever know.<br> Never have I told this recipe,<br> not even to my sisters...<br> ...because they are not good cooks.<br> But if you let me talk to you,<br> I give it to you.<br> Is fine recipe.<br> Now, your daughter<br> wants to write, you say.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Does she write?<br> - Or does she only want to write?<br> - She writes all the time.<br> Maybe she should not be author,<br> but is hard to give up something...<br> ...that has meant so much.<br> - I agree.<br> - I bring her stories. I bring 1 2.<br> - Twelve.<br> Well, if you could read maybe just one.<br> To know if someone cooks well,<br> you do not need to eat a whole dinner.<br> You're very persuasive.<br> - Why didn't your daughter come herself?<br> - Well, she was too unhappy...<br> ...and too scared of you.<br> You are celebrity.<br> - But I see your picture in the paper.<br> - That frightful picture.<br> Well, is a picture of woman<br> who like to eat good.<br> It certainly is.<br> Now tell me about the koettbullar.<br> Yeah.<br> When you make the meatballs,<br> you drop them in boiling stock.<br> Not water. That is one of the secrets.<br> And the cream sauce is another secret.<br> Is half sour cream, added at the last.<br> Oh, that sounds marvelous.<br> You have to grind the meat six times...<br> ...and then you...<br> Well, I could write this out for you.<br> And while I write, you could read.<br> I remember that having written<br> a tragic farewell to my art...<br> ...I was busy tearing up<br> all the stories I'd ever written...<br> ...when I heard Mama's voice<br> at the foot of the attic stairs.<br> - Katrin?<br> - Yes, Mama.<br> You are writing?<br> No, Mama.<br> That's all over.<br> That's what I want to talk<br> to you about.<br> It's all right, Mama. Really, it is.<br> I've been tearing up my stories.<br> Only, I couldn't find half of them.<br> Well, they're here.<br> Did you take them?<br> What for?<br> Katrin, I've been to see Ms. Moorhead.<br> Who's Ms...?<br> Florence Dana Moorhead?<br> You took her my stories?<br> She read five of them.<br> I was two hours with her.<br> We have glass of sherry.<br> We have two glass of sherry.<br> What did she say about them?<br> Well, she say they are not good.<br> Well, I knew that.<br> It was hardly worth going to the trouble.<br> But she say more.<br> Will you listen, Katrin?<br> Sure. I'll listen.<br> She say you write now only because<br> of what you have read in other books.<br> That for years, she write bad stories<br> about people in the olden times...<br> ...until one day she remembers<br> something that happen...<br> ...in her own town,<br> and she feels she must tell that.<br> And that is how she write<br> her first good story.<br> She say you must write<br> about things you know.<br> That's what my teacher always told me.<br> Yeah, well, maybe<br> your teacher was right.<br> But she say you are to go on writing...<br> ...that you have the gift.<br> And that when you have written story<br> that is real and true...<br> ...then you are to send it to her agent<br> and say she recommend you.<br> Here.<br> No. Is recipe for goulash<br> as her grandmother make it.<br> Here.<br> It helps, Katrin, what I have told you?<br> Yes, I guess it helps...<br> ...some.<br> But I haven't been anywhere<br> or seen anything.<br> Well, could you write about<br> San Francisco, maybe?<br> Is fine city. Ms. Moorhead write<br> about her hometown.<br> Yes, I know, but you got to have<br> a central character or something.<br> She always writes about<br> her grandfather.<br> He was a wonderful man.<br> Well, could you maybe<br> write about Papa?<br> - Papa.<br> - Papa's a fine man.
