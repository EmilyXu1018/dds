But did you love him?<br> That's what I asked, honey.<br> Oh, Delilah,<br> I think I was too young<br> to know very much about love.<br> Mother was dead.<br> He was my father's choice.<br> Father wanted somebody<br> to take care of me,<br> so I married him.<br> Mmm, that's a pity.<br> It's too bad<br> when you get started off<br> on the wrong foot first.<br> Oh, but you'll<br> get over it.<br> Youse got a big surprise<br> comin' to you, Miss Bea.<br> You need some lovin',<br> honey child.<br> [Chuckles]<br> What I need<br> is a little supper.<br> Yes'm.<br> I got some nice food<br> ready for you tonight.<br> That's fine.<br> Thank you.<br> I've gotJessie.<br> That's enough.<br> Delilah, honestly now,<br> doesn't she look<br> like an angel?<br> Why she am an angel,<br> Miss Bea.<br> ## [Humming]<br> [Jessie]<br> Can we have<br> some pancakes too?<br> Please, Mammy.<br> They look awful tasty.<br> Go on out of here.<br> You two have had<br> your breakfast.<br> Go play, and take<br> that fleabag with you.<br> Okay, Aunt Delilah.<br> You'll be the death of me<br> with these pancakes.<br> I'm glad you finds 'em<br> to your taste, ma'am.<br> I've never tasted anything<br> so good in my life.<br> How do you make them?<br> It's a secret.<br> Them pancakes<br> is my grannie's secret.<br> She passed it down to my mammy,<br> and my mammy told me.<br> But I ain't tellin' nobody.<br> No, sir.<br> I don't blame you.<br> I wouldn't either.<br> Down South, my mammy<br> was famous for her pancakes.<br> White folks come<br> from miles around<br> just to taste 'em. Yes'm.<br> It's a secret, and<br> it's gonna die with Delilah.<br> All you do<br> is just take a little...<br> [Whispering]<br> That's all?<br> That's all.<br> There's your secret.<br> Course you've got<br> to be light with the flap.<br> Mmm, look at the time.<br> You've made me late<br> with your pancakes.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good-bye, honey.<br> And good luck for the day.<br> Thank you, Delilah.<br> Miss Bea?<br> Wait a minute.<br> What is it?<br> What's the matter?<br> I want you to take<br> this rabbit's foot and<br> put it in your money purse.<br> Now, Delilah!<br> Yes'm, you must take it.<br> Are you the owner?<br> Yes'm.<br> I'm Mrs. Pullman.<br> Mrs. B. Pullman.<br> You know.<br> Sorry,<br> but I don't.<br> My husband was B. Pullman,<br> the man who was killed<br> in the wreck.<br> The train wreck at Camden.<br> I remember the wreck,<br> but there were so many killed.<br> He used to sell<br> waffle syrup to<br> the hotels and places.<br> It's wonderful syrup.<br> A hundred percent<br> pure maple.<br> I don't eat it.<br> Bad stomach. Gas.<br> No, I don't mean...<br> I'm keeping up<br> the B. Pullman business.<br> I was wondering. Could<br> I make a deal with you<br> to rent this store?<br> I have a marvelous formula<br> for making pancakes,<br> and it's my intention...<br> to rent a store,<br> have a pancake place and<br> sell syrup on the side.<br> This morning I was going<br> to decide on several sites.<br> This is one of them.<br> It's a good concession.<br> One of the best<br> on the boardwalk.<br> How much are you asking<br> for rent?<br> Two hundred and fifty.<br> That's very high.<br> [Laughs]<br> That's terribly high.<br> You've got to pay<br> for a good location.<br> This store has nice<br> living quarters in the back.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Yes.<br> What will you do<br> in the way of decorating?<br> A lot will have to be done.<br> It's going to rent<br> as is.<br> You don't think I'd take it<br> in this condition?<br> Look at it.<br> It's filthy!<br> It needs new paint,<br> new paper.<br> And the floor.<br> That'll have to be fixed.<br> If it needs it,<br> you'll have to do it.<br> Will you give me<br> three months free?<br> What?<br> Give me three months free,<br> and I'll do all<br> the decorating and alterations.<br> What do you think<br> I am?<br> I might consider<br> one month.<br> Make it two,<br> and I'll take a year's lease.<br> It's a deal.<br> I'll have to have the first<br> and last month in advance.<br> I can't do that.<br> I can't give you anything<br> in advance.<br> When do you expect<br> to pay?<br> Well, you said<br> you'd give me two months.<br> So I'll start paying<br> the third month.<br> Nothing doing.<br> But I'll need every dollar<br> I have for alterations<br> and fixtures.<br> Delilah. Delilah!<br> We're going<br> into business.<br> We're which?<br> You're going to make<br> your pancakes, and I'm going<br> to sell them on the boardwalk.<br> I've rented a concession.<br> We're gonna live in rooms in the<br> back. The store's at the front.<br> Get buckets,<br> rags and soap. We've got<br> to start cleaning up.<br> Gather the children.<br> They'll have to go with us.<br> I talked to a painter<br> and a man<br> about the fixtures.<br> They'll be there,<br> so hurry up.<br> There.<br> This is it, Delilah.<br> My, it's<br> a very nice store.<br> You and Peola go outside<br> and play. There's a lovely<br> place for you in the back.<br> Go look at the nice yard<br> you've got to play in.<br> Won't that be pretty<br> when there's flowers in there?<br> Be careful. Don't sit<br> on the floor, 'cause<br> it's all dirty yet.<br> These will be the living<br> quarters. The most important<br> thing now is the store.<br> Take that sign down<br> and cover the front window<br> with Bon Ami.<br> Miss Bea?<br> Yes.<br> Is somebody died?<br> What?<br> Is you been left money?<br> Mercy, no!<br> Well you only had<br> $19 and some change<br> this morning.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Shh. Here's the painter.<br> How do you do?<br> Hello. You certainly did<br> come over right away.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> This is it.<br> All this has to be painted,<br> the ceiling calcimined,<br> and that back room papered<br> in the paper I selected.<br> I want you to give me an estimate,<br> and please make it low.<br> But I must-a see it first.<br> Oh, sure.<br> Go right ahead.<br> Do you paint signs?<br> No, but I can have<br> one made for you.<br> I'll tell you what I want.<br> I want a great big sign with lots...<br> [Bea]<br> Delilah?<br> Ma'am?<br> - Smile.<br> - Huh?<br> You know, smile.<br> No, no.<br> A great big one.<br> Oh, yes'm.<br> [Laughing]<br> That's it!<br> Now turn to the right.<br> Hold it.<br> That's what I want.<br> A big picture of Delilah<br> looking like that.<br> And underneath, "Aunt Delilah's<br> Homemade Pancakes."<br> You see what I mean?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> But I must send someone<br> to make that up for you.<br> All right. Thanks.<br> That's all right.<br> [Laughing]<br> Delilah! All right.<br> All right.<br> It's all over.<br> It's all over.<br> I'm gonna<br> make you famous yet.<br> ## [Humming]<br> ## [Humming Continues]<br> [Muttering In Italian]<br> My Lordy, who's that?<br> The furniture man<br> about the fixtures.<br> How do you do?<br> Did you bring the estimate<br> on the things I selected?<br> Yes, Mrs. Pullman.<br> Good.<br> This is where the grill<br> should be, I think.<br> And all across here<br> I'd like to have shelves.<br> The counter will be there.<br> If the shelves start there<br> and go straight up the top,<br> it should be nice,<br> don't you th...<br> Will you excuse me?<br> Surely.<br> I'll look around.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Did you get it<br> all figured out?<br> I tell you.<br> For a first-a class-a job,<br> there is lots of work here.<br> For a first-a class-a<br> A-one job,<br> because I don't<br> work cheap,<br> Yes.<br> The best-a figure<br> I can give you is $193.<br> A hundred and<br> ninety-three dollars?<br> That should be<br> a good job.<br> Sure!<br> Five percent off<br> for 30 days?<br> Huh?<br> No, no, no.
