Jack.!<br> - Up to The Hub.<br> - We just slipped.<br> You little brats!<br> - I'll... I'll...<br> - And who will you be hittin'?<br> - Look at me!<br> - A bit of mud, and it behind.<br> A pair of tender hands and plenty<br> of soap, it'll be as good as new.<br> You don't know what<br> you're talking about!<br> There's not a washerwoman in this<br> town that could save this dress.<br> Is that so now? And what<br> would you say if I told you...<br> that I could do it myself,<br> if it was worth me time?<br> All right. You're so smart. You<br> save this dress, and I'll give you...<br> I'll be namin' the price, and you<br> providin' the soap and the tub.<br> Hey, Ma.! Ma, I'm back.!<br> I got three from Gil Warren<br> and two from Mrs. Palmer.<br> - She says a pair of her whatchamacallems are missing.<br> - Oh, she did?<br> You can tell the fine lady she'll get 'em<br> back when she pays for the soap she owes.<br> - Yes'm.<br> - And put up the horse.<br> Give her some oats. And be<br> sure the barn door's fastened.<br> And then get your hands and<br> face washed before it's supper.<br> Yes'm.<br> Gretchen.<br> Ja?<br> - Look out!<br> - The milk!<br> - It's gone!<br> - Oh, it's all right.<br> No use crying over it now. It's spilt.<br> She might've kicked you.<br> I told you never to milk her without<br> putting that bar between her legs.<br> That's what it's<br> for. Daisy, you hussy!<br> Mrs. O'Leary! What will she say?<br> - Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it with Ma.<br> - Ja?<br> Ja.<br> Aw, gee.<br> Ja. Gut.<br> - Thank you, Daisy.<br> - Ma.! Ma.!<br> - Out here, Jack.<br> - I thought you were coming down to court to hear me.<br> With all Chicago waitin' to<br> be washed? Get along with ya.<br> - Where'd I get the time?<br> - I sure made 'em sit up and take notice.<br> - Did you now?<br> - I told 'em just what I thought about 'em.<br> "My client is right," I<br> said, " and you know it.<br> But what do you care about people,<br> as long as you can fill your pockets?"<br> No wonder they say this is the worst city,<br> with politicians like Gil Warren running things.<br> - And how did the fine gentleman like that?<br> - Oh, he was sweatin' plenty.<br> - " Sure," I said. " What do you care about Chicago being bad...<br> - Take the handle.<br> "as long as business is good and you've<br> got all the beef and pork in the world?<br> "But I'll tell you this. It takes more<br> than those things to make this a great city.<br> "It takes people with<br> some sense of decency...<br> to make this not only the biggest<br> city in the world, but the best. "<br> It's a fine silver tongue you ha'...<br> and your father would<br> be that proud of you.<br> And I told him...<br> Here you are!<br> Well, good-bye, boys. Don't<br> let 'em keep you too long.<br> If you see my old lady, tell her I'm<br> sitting up with a friend that was took sick.<br> Have a cigar, Jim. Thanks for the<br> ride. I'll do the same for you.<br> Thanks, lad. Anytime you're<br> coming our way, let us know.<br> - We'll be glad to have you with us.<br> - I'll remember that.<br> Watch the mud on your<br> shoes, Pickle. You know Ma.<br> Hey, Ma! It's me!<br> - Hello, Ma!<br> - Howdy, Mrs. O'Leary.<br> - Hi, Jack.<br> - Hello, Pickle.<br> - Sorry you lost your case, Jack.<br> - Lost?<br> Sure. I, uh... I forgot to tell<br> you. The judge dismissed it.<br> Heaven help me. And all the<br> time I thought he'd won it.<br> Don't worry. Warren won't hold it<br> against you, as long as you lost.<br> I heard about it. A fella said<br> Jack had the courtroom hypnotized.<br> Yeah, everybody but the judge.<br> Had him too, only Gil<br> Warren put him on the bench.<br> Keep your hand away from that.<br> But, Ma, it's just the right size.<br> - Ma, for the last time, will you quit this laundry business?<br> - Why should I be quittin'?<br> 'Cause I don't want my best girl<br> bending over a washtub all her life.<br> - Go along with you now.<br> - I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll get you a new place, out of the Patch,<br> set you up like the finest hussy in town.<br> Huh? Look. Look, Ma.<br> - Where did you get that money?<br> - A fellow paid me.<br> You're lyin'. You've been<br> gambling at that racetrack again.<br> There wasn't any gambling to it, Ma.<br> There are only eight horses in<br> the race... mine and seven others.<br> - All we had to do was shoot the other seven.<br> - Hmph!<br> Huh, indeed. Come on,<br> Ma. How about it, hmm?<br> - I'll not be livin' on money that isn't honestly got.<br> - Give us a kiss then, huh?<br> - Now, Dion, get along with ya. I've got my work. Dion!<br> - Aw, come on.<br> Won't wash out.<br> Look at it. I told that Gil Warren...<br> I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths<br> they'd been drawing pictures on.<br> - Send it back.<br> - Wait a minute. This looks like a map.<br> Maybe Warren's gonna hunt<br> for a buried treasure.<br> Hunt for it? He's already<br> found it in the city treasury.<br> Something about Randolph Street...<br> and... and Madison.<br> This looks like the tracks<br> for the horse car line.<br> I know what it is.<br> This means they're gonna run the<br> car line along Randolph Street.<br> You're crazy. They've already<br> surveyed Madison for the tracks.<br> Sure, they have. That's exactly what makes<br> me think they're gonna run along Randolph.<br> - By golly, maybe you're right.<br> - Of course I'm right!<br> That's the way they cheat the people...<br> get them to invest on Madison Street...<br> and then switch the line<br> by their own property.<br> - What an idea.<br> - You're right. This information is worth a fortune.<br> - Ha! Listen to him.<br> - And I'm gonna get part of it.<br> You with your fine talk<br> and your grand plans...<br> not a penny ever honestly<br> earned to your name.<br> Maybe so. But if I<br> had this corner here...<br> where all the traffic meets, I'd<br> put up the biggest saloon in town.<br> - Saloon?<br> - And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary.<br> I wouldn't be stepping my foot inside.<br> Then I guess we'll have to keep<br> on rushing the growler for you.<br> Oh, but look.<br> There's a name already<br> scribbled in right on my corner.<br> B- F-A-W-C-E-double<br> "T."<br> - B. Fawcett.<br> - Ever heard of him?<br> No. It's a new one on me.<br> - Stop it! Stop it! Are you out of your mind?<br> - I've gotta have this name.<br> We'll go down to Gil Warren's and see what<br> we can find out about this Fawcett fellow.<br> - You've ruined it!<br> - There was already a hole in it, Mrs. O'Leary.<br> The scamp.<br> Hello, Rondo.<br> - Where's Mr. Warren?<br> - The other end of the bar.<br> - Hello, Mr. Warren.<br> - Oh, hello, son.<br> - Howdy, Mr. Warren.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - I'd like to talk to you for a moment.<br> - Sure. Go ahead.<br> It's kind of private,<br> and I thought that, uh...<br> Not now. Not now.<br> Little later, perhaps.<br> Stick around. Glad to have seen you.<br> Whew!<br> - What a woman.<br> - Yeah. Yeah, that's right.<br> - Is she new?<br> - Yeah, she's new, new as far as Chicago's concerned.<br> She was the biggest hit Niblo's<br> Garden in New York ever had.<br> A sensation. And I'm<br> paying her a bigger price...<br> than any entertainer<br> in this town ever got.<br> - That's Belle Fawcett.<br> - Oh, Belle Fawcett.<br> B. Fawcett?<br> Ladies and gentlemen, as<br> an added treat tonight...<br> the proceeds to go to<br> the widow and orphans...<br> or our late bartender,<br> Aloysius O'Malley...<br> who was shot in front<br> of this very door...<br> my little girls are going to give a<br> special performance of our famous classic...<br> Living Statues...<br> an artistic divertissement straight<br> from New York and Paris, France.<br> And remember, gentlemen...<br> it's all for sweet<br> charity, and no tights.<br> What am I bid?<br> - One dollar.<br> - One dollar? Do I hear two?<br> - Four dollars.<br> - Four, the gentleman says.<br> - Who'll make it five?<br> - I'll pay five.<br> Five. Now we're getting<br> somewhere. Who'll make it six?<br> Speak right up,<br> handsome. What is it? Six?<br> I'll pay $100 to charity if<br> Belle Fawcett plays Venus.<br> We have a comedian in the house.<br> - Go ahead. Take his offer.<br> - Sold to handsome for $100.<br> Come on. Let's see the<br> color of your money.<br> Fifty, 70, 90, 100.<br> Whiskey!<br> Right through that door. I'll be<br> with you in a moment. Thank you.<br> Hey, what's this? Wait a minute!<br> Yes, Miss Fawcett.<br> Your carriage is here.<br> Will you tell Mr. Warren I'll meet him<br> for lunch tomorrow at the Palmer House?<br> - Yes, Miss Fawcett.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Oh!<br> - Get in.!<br> Let me go!<br> - Shut up!<br> - I won't! Let me out of here!<br> - Shut up.<br> - Let me out of here, or I'll jump!<br> Go ahead. Jump.<br> Oh, it's you. Driver! Driver!<br> - No use yelling at him. I fixed him.<br> - Oh, you're crazy!<br> Maybe. But I was sane<br> enough until tonight.<br> Then I heard you sing, and<br> something happened to me.<br> Something swept over me I've never felt<br> before or ever expect to feel again.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I'm in love with you, Belle.<br> - Get out, or I'll call the police!<br> - They can't stop me from loving you.<br> Maybe not, but they can<br> sure cool you off, brother.<br> I know it sounds crazy... and<br> I apologize... but it's true.<br> Right now, my heart's pounding so.<br> - Listen to it. Ow!<br> - Oh, you fool.<br> I'm trembling all over.<br> And I wanna be calm and cool<br> so I can make you understand.<br> Say, are you on the level?<br> Absolutely.<br> - But I don't even know who you are.<br> - Does that matter?<br> It does to me. And I'll<br> tell you another thing.<br> - I didn't like that cheap trick you pulled on me.<br> - I had to talk to you alone.<br> What gave you the idea you<br> could make love to me like this?<br> Just give me a chance. I'll<br> tell you the whole story.<br> All right. You can stop<br> here and buy me a drink.<br> No, not here. It's too crowded.<br> Since you've taken me by storm...<br> the least you might do is to take me<br> to your place so we can really talk.<br> Very well, but your<br> story had better be good.<br> All right, George. You can<br> drive to Miss Fawcett's home.<br> Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.<br> - So this is where you live?<br> - Yes.<br> Way up there on the second floor.<br> I think I can make it.<br> Back to The Hub quick!<br> Hey! Hey, wait a minute!<br> Whew! What a woman.<br> - Let's tell Ma.<br> - Ja. You want to?<br> Do you reckon she suspects?<br> I was never that<br> surprised in all me life.<br> All this hand-holdin' and goo-goo<br> eyein' and sighin' and gigglin'.<br> I'm all wore out tryin'<br> to look the other way.<br> - Aw, Ma.<br> - Now, I suppose you'll be tellin' me...<br> you want to get married.<br> - Why, sure.<br> - You scamp. Takin' the best ironer I ever had.<br> Well, if it's love you're after...<br> I guess a few shirts and<br> tablecloths can't stand in the way...<br> but I won't have you sittin'<br> around and waitin' and not eatin'.<br> You'll be gettin' married right away<br> and I want no back talk about it.<br> Now, give me that pail.<br> And I'd be ashamed, with a<br> fine spring moon outside...<br> and you in a barn puttin' ideas<br> in the head of a temperamental cow.<br> - So, you're in love at last.<br> - Sure, Mike... with you.<br> And are you now? And I suppose it's<br> for me that you're slickin' your hair...<br> anticipatin' yourself in front of<br> a mirror until it's half wore out.<br> Well, you want me to<br> look nice, don't you?<br> And I suppose you'll be holdin'<br> her hands, maybe stealin' a kiss...<br> and her tellin' ya how grand ya<br> are and callin' ya pretty names.<br> Here, let Ma do it.<br> And you believin' her.<br> That shirt! I thought so. Take it off.<br> Oh, but, Ma, it's a beaut.<br> Look. "D.V.S."... Who's that?<br> His name is Swift and he<br> sells pigs. Now take it off.<br> - It needs to go back in the morning.<br> - Oh, come on, Ma!<br> Take it off. Take it off.<br> Oh! Who's the best darn washer woman<br> in the whole bloomin' city of Chicago?<br> Ma! Say, Ma! I won my first case!<br> - I knew you would!<br> - Congratulations.<br> The jury wasn't out<br> more than 15 minutes...<br> and the judge said it was the<br> finest speech he's heard all session.<br> So did the lawyer from the<br> other side. And... yippee!<br> Congratulations. I always<br> knew you had it in your tongue.<br> A fellow from the Tribune<br> said he's gonna write it up.<br> - You're gonna get your name in the paper?<br> - Yes!<br> - How much did you get?<br> - Huh?<br> - How much did you get?<br> - You did get paid for it, didn't you?<br> The fellow only makes $10 a week,<br> and he's got a wife and a family.<br> Ten dollars a week? That's<br> just $10 more than you make.<br> - I couldn't take his money, could I?<br> - I give up.<br> I've got one son that steals my laundry<br> and spends his money heaven knows where...<br> another a lawyer and wins cases<br> and don't get paid for them.<br> I should have brought the two of you up as<br> Irish bricklayers, and every Saturday payday.<br> Don't mind her, as long<br> as she can keep her job.<br> - Night, Ma. Don't sit up for me. I may be late.<br> - Hmm.<br> Huh, indeed.<br> Where's he going all dressed up?<br> Where is any of us going? And<br> where is it all going to end?<br> For one thing, we can<br> be going in to supper.<br> I wish you could have<br> heard what that judge said.<br> - That you, Miss Belle?<br> - Yes.<br> - Any messages for me?<br> - No.<br> Nothing except a heap more flowers and<br> some champagne from that same gentleman.<br> Lord, honey, you sure got<br> him snortin' in his sleep.<br> I hope you threw them out.<br> I throwed out the roses, but you<br> knows what a mess broken bottles make.<br> Did you tell him not to<br> come around here anymore?<br> I done told him that till<br> I'm black in the face.<br> These corsets are so<br> tight, I can hardly breathe.<br> As long as the men folks likes a<br> small waist, us gals has got to suffer.<br> - You want anything else, Miss Belle?<br> - No, thank you, Hattie.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - You can call me early tomorrow afternoon.<br> - Yes'm.<br> Get out of here.<br> - Get out.!<br> - But listen...<br> - Get out.!<br> - I'll tell you, I wanna...<br> - Get out of here!<br> - Belle, I wanna talk to...<br> - Get out.!<br> - Listen, Belle. Don't act like that.<br> - What do you mean by breaking into my place?<br> - Don't be like that.<br> - Don't act like that. I want to speak to you.<br> - Get out of here!<br> - Get out of here! Hey! Help! Help!<br> - I want to speak to you.<br> Hattie! Hattie!<br> - You calling me, Miss Belle?<br> - Hattie.!<br> Help! Let me...<br> Police! Murder! Help!<br> Police! Police!<br> Hattie! Let me go!<br> Oh, you!<br> - Now, won't you tell me what this is all about?<br> - I love you, Belle.<br> I mean, really.<br> - Well...<br> - I want the truth.<br> - You have a piece of property on Randolph Street.<br> - Of all the...<br> I thought if you and I were to<br> put up a place like Warren's...<br> only better, more class...<br> we could make a lot of money.<br> But I really meant that<br> about being crazy about you.<br> Why didn't you say<br> so in the first place?<br> I'm a businesswoman. I'd have<br> listened to any proposition...<br> without all this foolishness.<br> - You would've?<br> - Of course I would.<br> What a woman.<br> Right through this way, Mr. Police.!<br> Sorry, boss...<br> but it looks like the fire's out.<br> Now, look, Senator.<br> Gil Warren controls...<br> the Patch with all its votes.<br> You need votes. Now, as<br> long as Warren goes along...<br> with no opposition, he has you and<br> your interests just where he wants them.<br> Who knows, but the day<br> may come when Warren...<br> gets other ideas<br> that'd be embarrassing.<br> - We have an offer to make you.<br> - Now, I have the greatest...<br> attraction that ever came<br> to Chicago... Miss Fawcett.<br> Now with your backing and<br> your money to get us started...<br> we'll open the greatest<br> saloon Chicago's ever known...<br> on the busiest corner in town...<br> and I'll control the Patch...<br> I'll tell 'em how to vote.<br> And what's more, Senator,<br> you see this floor?<br> You see those real silver dollars<br> that Potter Palmer put in there?<br> Well, every month after<br> we get started, Senator...<br> they'll be 1,000 of those for you.<br> What do you say? Are you in?<br> I'm always in the market<br> for marketable goods.<br> Go ahead.<br> Full protection for me, security<br> for you and your family...<br> and a hundred dollars in<br> cash every Monday from now on.<br> Young man, are you trying to bribe me?<br> Why, Commissioner, how<br> can you say such a word?<br> Mrs. Kelly, good evening. Welcome to The<br> Senate, and I hope you enjoy yourself.<br> Good evening, sir. Good<br> evening, Mr. O'Shaughnessy.<br> Welcome to The Senate.<br> Hey, you mugs, where do you<br> think you are? Take off your hats.<br> Keep on your coats and<br> shake hands with the boss.<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - Now listen, shorty.<br> You're taking the wrong "altitude"...<br> 'cause this is the only saloon in<br> town I ain't been thrown out of.<br> I'll give you just five minutes.<br> I can do it in three.<br> That's tellin' him.<br> - Captain Jamison.<br> - Captain Jamison, welcome.<br> - And this is my daughter Ann.<br> - Miss Colby.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> I've been begging Father to<br> bring me here for the opening.<br> - I'm glad he did.<br> - It's marvelous.<br> - I've never seen anything like it.<br> - Thank you.<br> - May I show you to your table?<br> - Please do.<br> Gentlemen, you give me The<br> Senate, I give you Chicago.<br> Father says you're the<br> smartest young man in Chicago.<br> That's because he knows I'll<br> deliver the Patch on Election Day.<br> He says you have a great future, as big<br> as Gil Warren's if you do as he says.<br> He's the boss, and one<br> of America's finest.<br> - And now... I must change my costume.<br> - Allow me.<br> I want to talk to you, my boy.<br> I have some great plans in store.<br> Surely not tonight, Senator, when you have<br> so beautiful a daughter to entertain us.<br> Father won't talk business if I<br> ask him not to. Will you, darling?<br> I can't imagine the senator doing<br> anything that you asked him not to.<br> That's right. She wraps me<br> around her finger all the time.<br> Uh, excuse me, please.<br> - I'll be right back.<br> - We'll expect you.<br> He's nice-looking, isn't he? I<br> mean, for someone from the Patch.<br> - Hello, Warren.<br> - Why, hello, son.<br> - Mr. O'Leary. - Jim-dandy<br> place you've got here.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Nothing like it in Chicago. I'm proud of you.<br> - You mean, you're not sore?<br> - Why, no. I've come over to bury the hatchet.<br> Live and let live... that's my motto.<br> - Come on. Have a drink.<br> - Matter of fact, I wanted a word in private with you.<br> - Oh, sure. Come on in my office.<br> - See you in a minute, Rondo.<br> Rondo, step up to the bar.<br> Anything you want, on the house.<br> Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.<br> - How old are you, son?<br> - Old enough to vote. Why?<br> I was just thinking, you've<br> come along mighty fast.<br> When I was your age, do<br> you know what I was doing?<br> I was rounding up runaway slaves<br> and practically starving to death.<br> - Sit down, Gil.<br> - Take it from me, times have changed.<br> - Everything's youth today.<br> - Well, you seem to have done pretty well, Gil.<br> I've managed, but you've got a great<br> future ahead of you. Mark my words.<br> Well, I hope you're right.<br> I don't blame you for taking<br> Belle. She's a great woman.<br> I'd have married her if I'd had the<br> chance, but she never cared for me.<br> - It was just a business deal, and you outbid me.<br> - What's on your mind?<br> What would you say, son, if I told<br> you I was gonna close The Hub, quit?<br> I'd say you were up to<br> something. What is it?<br> I'm thinking of running for mayor.<br> Mayor?<br> I've been electing them long enough.<br> Now I'm going to elect myself,<br> if you'll ride along with me.<br> - How do I come in?<br> - You're a smart young fella.<br> If you watch your step, you're<br> going to be a big power in this town.<br> I could build a bigger place and give you<br> trouble, but I've had all I want of this.<br> - You say the word, and I'm through.<br> - You close The Hub?<br> Exactly, and give you an open field.<br> Now, we either work together<br> politically or fight it out.<br> It's up to you.<br> It's a nice place you have<br> here, but, like a tinder box...<br> touch a match to it, and it'll<br> go off like a Roman candle.<br> But what the devil? Chicago is<br> big enough for both of us and more.<br> Together we could run<br> this town and run it right.<br> You, Belle and me pulling<br> together, it'd be a lead pipe cinch.<br> Yeah. Sounds all right.<br> But naturally there's a little expense<br> involved, and right now with the...<br> I took the liberty of<br> bringing my check for $10,000.<br> There'll be more between<br> now and election time.<br> I think we'll manage<br> very well, Your Honor.<br> Now I could use that drink<br> you were talking about.<br> Come on.<br> Now, Belle, you've got to<br> come to my table right now...<br> and have a bottle of wine with me.<br> I'd love to, but you'll have<br> to excuse me for one minute.<br> Belle!<br> Hello. I thought I<br> saw you come in here.<br> I was just telling Dion what<br> a great place you've got.<br> I never saw you looking so beautiful.<br> - I always did say she was the best looker Chicago ever saw.<br> - Thanks.<br> Better watch yourself, son.<br> I'll get her back if I can.<br> - But it looks like it won't be to The Hub.<br> - Gil's closing The Hub for good.<br> Really? Why?<br> There's the music for<br> your song. Better hurry.<br> Dion'll tell you all about it later.<br> Whew! What a woman.<br> Yes, that's exactly what I said<br> the first time I saw her. Remember?<br> Oh, I'm... Miss Colby, Miss Fawcett.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do? So sorry.<br> You'll have to excuse Mr. O'Leary<br> another few minutes. I'll send him back.<br> - That'll be very sweet of you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Is that the woman?<br> - Why, yes, I believe so.<br> She's pretty... in a way.<br> - Women like her have all the advantage, don't they?<br> - All except one.<br> I wasn't thinking of marriage.<br> - So you're taking his money?<br> - What's the matter with his money?<br> - The check's good, isn't it?<br> - You know how he feels about us, the threats he's made...<br> I wouldn't worry about<br> that if I were you.<br> Ever since I left his place,<br> he's schemed to get even.<br> Now he's trying to do<br> it with your own help.<br> - He knows that if he's mayor...<br> - What makes you think he's gonna be mayor?<br> - But you took his money.<br> - Sure.<br> Sure, and I'll vote for<br> him myself, if necessary...<br> but I didn't say how<br> the Patch'll vote.<br> - Why, that's...<br> - Politics.<br> He'd knife me if he could, and<br> I simply mean to beat him to it.<br> Why, you dirty dog.<br> - You love me?<br> - Certainly not.<br> Go on. Say it before<br> I break your back.<br> Who was that little doll-faced blonde<br> you were smiling all over yourself about?<br> Senator's daughter. I have<br> to be nice to him, don't I?<br> Why weren't you<br> breathing down his neck?<br> Stop it.<br> You and The Senate<br> and Warren on the run.<br> In other words, Mr. O'Leary<br> is rising in the world.<br> Mr. O'Leary and present company.<br> Chief, Mitch is here.<br> Come on in and shut the door.<br> Is it true that you were caught<br> registering under a false name?<br> Gee, chief, how was I to know<br> that guy was already registered?<br> I told you this bozo<br> don't use his head.<br> Oh, have a brain, you. Getting<br> caught with an election coming up...<br> and that reform crowd<br> already yelling its head off.<br> It would serve you right if I let<br> them send you to jail for life...<br> but, no, I've got to sit through a<br> trial and figure a way to get you out.<br> I oughta... Oh, get out.<br> Yeah! Come on out!<br> Now, where were we?<br> Oh, yes.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Everything fixed?<br> - The district attorney said if you're worried...<br> he'll let us have witnesses to prove<br> Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years.<br> That's the kind of prosecutor I like.<br> - What'd you give him?<br> - The usual.<br> Chief! It ain't fair! It ain't fair!<br> - It ain't fair!<br> - What's the matter?<br> The district attorney... and<br> after we had him all fixed.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Well, he fell down...<br> and broke his ankle and he ain't here!<br> - The fool doesn't know how to walk?<br> - And the judge appointed...<br> somebody to take his<br> place and I don't know who.<br> - What's this mean?<br> - It means it ain't fixed.<br> Oh, come on.<br> In view of the unavoidable<br> detention of the district attorney...<br> the court has appointed<br> a special counsel...<br> a representative of the<br> Election Reform Committee...<br> in the case of The City of<br> Chicago v. Edward Mitchell.<br> Mr. O'Leary, are you<br> prepared to proceed?<br> - We're ready, Your Honor.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Is the defense ready?<br> - Uh, Your Honor...<br> Your Honor, certain<br> matters have come up.<br> New evidence have been<br> uncovered that compels me to...<br> Go ahead with the trial.<br> - Go ahead?<br> - Proceed.<br> The defense is ready, Your Honor.<br> You may proceed, Mr. O'Leary.<br> Your Honor, it is no secret<br> that multiple voting...<br> for years has been<br> a common practice...<br> in that section of Chicago<br> known as the "Patch. "<br> So common, it has come to be<br> regarded as one of the minor evils...<br> in that district.<br> Men who occupy the highest<br> offices in this city...<br> openly and brazenly bid<br> against each other...<br> for that very vote.<br> Any mention of it is dismissed<br> with an indulgent smile...<br> as something that should<br> not be talked about.<br> There are men in this very<br> courtroom, Your Honor...<br> who control every<br> election in this city...<br> with such illegal votes.<br> Men who sit in their fine saloons...<br> surrounded by every luxury<br> that money can buy...<br> or that they can steal...<br> while public officials bow and smile<br> before them and fight for their favor.<br> Until today, nobody has ever obtained<br> sufficient evidence to convict them.<br> Now, however, we have an eyewitness...<br> who was actually present when<br> the defendant, Edward Mitchell...<br> was caught attempting to register<br> under four different names...<br> The last time, as the beloved<br> Bishop Cornwall himself.<br> You know, he's really good.<br> - Some day he'll be a great lawyer.<br> - I think he's all right now.<br> Mr. Clerk, call Carrie<br> Donohue to the stand.<br> Carrie Donohue take the stand.<br> - She can't do this to me.<br> - Shh! Quiet!<br> Stand up. Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear to tell the truth, the<br> whole truth and nothing but the truth...<br> - so help you God? What's your name?<br> - I do.<br> - Carrie Donohue.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Miss Donohue, you know this defendant?<br> - Do I know him?<br> - Hmph! That big squirt.<br> - None of that now.<br> - I'll haul off...<br> - Quiet!<br> - Order in the court.<br> - Refrain from personal remarks.<br> Tell the court what you know<br> about this man's registration.<br> - Well, my gentleman friend's...<br> - Face the judge.<br> hired to watch the registration<br> and I'm keeping him company...<br> when this big squirt walks in.<br> - Well, he don't see me<br> and I don't say anything...<br> but when he keeps comin'<br> back, I get suspicious...<br> and I'm just about to tell my friend<br> that something funny's going on...<br> when, sure enough,<br> back he comes again...<br> and, this time, he says he's a bishop.<br> Well, that's too much even for me.<br> Order in the court.<br> - That's what you get for marrying 'em.<br> - You married to this woman?<br> - What?<br> - Can you imagine it?<br> - Ever divorce her?<br> - No! - Your Honor!<br> May it please the court, we ask<br> that this woman's testimony...<br> be stricken from the records...<br> and this case dismissed on the<br> grounds that the law says...<br> a wife cannot testify<br> against her husband!<br> - That woman is my client's lawful-wedded<br> spouse.! - Madam, is this true?<br> - Well, I married him once,<br> if that's what you mean...<br> - but I can tell you...<br> - That will do.<br> - Well, I mean that he...<br> - That will do.<br> Well. Hmph.<br> Mr. O'Leary, you distinctly told me...<br> that you had had time to familiarize<br> yourself with all the facts in the case...<br> and, yet, you take up this court's<br> time allowing your only witness...<br> to testify, although<br> she's clearly unqualified.<br> Your Honor, I assure you, this is as<br> much a surprise to me as it is to you.<br> I ask the court's pardon.<br> Case dismissed.<br> - Tough break, kid.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Aw, you can never tell about these women.<br> They'll put it over on you<br> every time, if they can...<br> but you were great<br> yourself, I was proud of you.<br> Wait'll I go after the<br> big fish, the higher-ups...<br> - then you'll really hear something.<br> - That's the way to talk.<br> - How about meeting Belle?<br> - It's about time.<br> Belle, this is brother<br> Jack. Jack, Miss Fawcett.<br> - How do you do?<br> - I've been looking forward to this for a long time.<br> - You have?<br> - Yes.<br> Dion isn't the only admirer<br> of beauty in the family.<br> Thank you.<br> - That was a very nice thing to say.<br> - I couldn't help...<br> but look at you all through the trial.<br> Maybe that's why you lost your case.<br> - Uh, can we drop you someplace?<br> - Oh, no. No thanks.<br> I've, uh... I've got some things<br> to do here in the building.<br> You know, it seemed kind of<br> funny, you and Dion on one side...<br> and me on the other,<br> fighting each other.<br> When we were kids, we<br> were always fighting.<br> I bet if any other<br> Irishers tried to horn in...<br> it was the O'Learys against the world.<br> - Oh, you said it.<br> - You two must've had fun when you were little.<br> - We still do. - Even though<br> we don't always see eye-to-eye.<br> Well, I've got to leave you here...<br> but I'll tell ya what<br> you do, Miss Fawcett...<br> - or shall I call you "Belle"?<br> - Please do.<br> Let Dion bring you up the house<br> some time for dinner, meet Ma.<br> Well, I'd be delighted.<br> I wanna show you some<br> pictures of Dion...<br> in his First Communion<br> suit at the age of nine.<br> And some of you without any suit<br> at all at the age of six months.<br> I wish you'd keep an eye<br> on this fellow for us.<br> He's getting up in the world so<br> fast, it might go to his head.<br> I'd kind of hate to<br> have to knock it off.<br> I'll try.<br> Good-bye. See you soon.<br> Good-bye, Jack.<br> - You know, I like him.<br> - They don't make 'em any better.<br> That was nice of him, wanting<br> me to meet your mother.<br> Well, yes. I've been<br> thinking about that myself.<br> Oh, don't. I understand<br> how she feels about me.<br> Oh, Ma's all right... A<br> little old-fashioned, perhaps.<br> Oh, please.<br> I had no idea he was so... so human.<br> Oh, sure. Takes after me.<br> You know, there's something<br> almost normal about him.<br> He just looks so real, you know<br> he believes everything he says.<br> Honestly, it just makes me sick to<br> think of a man like Gil Warren...<br> trying to run Chicago when there<br> are men here like your brother.<br> Can you imagine the mayor<br> he'd make if he had the chance?<br> Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed<br> up with that reform crowd...<br> Wait a minute.<br> - I've got an idea.<br> - What?<br> I just thought what do with<br> that check Gil Warren gave me.<br> Back to The Senate.<br> In brief, we've come here<br> to ask you to run for mayor.<br> - What?<br> - We have canvassed the field, and you're the man we want.<br> Well, this is all very<br> flattering, gentlemen.<br> May I... May I ask whom you represent?<br> The respectable people of Chicago...<br> citizens who want a new deal<br> in our city administration.<br> We're organizing a reform party.<br> - I'm not sure I'm the man.<br> - We're willing to take that chance.<br> - It's a great opportunity.<br> - Decent people are waiting for an honest program.<br> You'll carry every district,<br> except, perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch.<br> I'm not so sure he won't get that too.<br> Your brother's influential<br> there. Surely he'll support you.<br> I'm afraid you can't<br> count on my brother.<br> You see, we O'Learys<br> are a strange tribe.<br> - Then we'll win without the Patch.<br> - Chicago needs you.<br> - Yes, Mr. O'Leary.<br> - Will you do it, sir?<br> Thank you, gentlemen. I'll run.<br> What did he say when you<br> suggested that I would support him?<br> He said he's afraid he<br> couldn't figure on you.<br> Well, at least he's agreed<br> to run. That's the first step.<br> What worries me is, can you<br> control him once he's in?<br> He's a pretty stubborn young fellow.<br> You leave that to me. We<br> O'Learys are a strange tribe.<br> - How's that?<br> - Not bad.<br> Of course, it doesn't<br> look much like you.<br> "Jack O'Leary, candidate<br> for mayor. Reform ticket. "<br> That's a great thing for<br> Chicago. I'd like to help.<br> - You help me?<br> - Sure. Why not?<br> If other people say you're good enough<br> to be mayor, I'm not going to say no.<br> Of course, I couldn't<br> support you openly.<br> You know how I feel about the Patch.<br> Oh, of course. No strings attached.<br> - The fact you're my brother wouldn't mean a thing.<br> - Stop arguing, will you?<br> If you stood in the way of<br> something I felt oughta be done...<br> I'd go after you as fast as I would<br> after anybody else, maybe faster.<br> Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago<br> as a great city people can be proud of.<br> I'd wipe out all this<br> mushroom growth...<br> start all over on a sound<br> basis, with steel and stone.<br> You don't have to make<br> speeches to me, Jack.<br> I just wanted you to<br> know where I stand.<br> - Well, how much do I owe you?<br> - I'm two games up on you.<br> Ah. Twenty cents. What a gambler.<br> It's in the blood.<br> It's in the blood.<br> Say, why don't you get Belle and come to the<br> house tonight and take her and Ma for a drive?<br> - Ha! You know Ma.<br> - We'll get a couple of beers under her belt.<br> Well, heaven help us<br> if it doesn't work out.<br> - To His Honor, the future mayor.<br> - To Chicago!<br> And to herself, the<br> first lady of the city!<br> Oh, to the lot of you!<br> - The compliments of the season to you, ma'am.<br> - Oh, go on. More presents.<br> You should see the grand house we're<br> gettin' for you. Inside plumbing.<br> - And a butler in short pants.<br> - Heaven help me.<br> It's himself.<br> - Pa.!<br> - It looks just like him.<br> Sure got my nose.<br> I can remember the day we took<br> it like it was yesterday...<br> and the trouble we had<br> puttin' the collar on him.<br> - Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him?<br> - Hang him?<br> You'll do no such. He's gonna spend<br> the rest of his days on this organ.<br> If he only could have seen it himself.<br> Isn't he beautiful? I<br> want the baby to see it.<br> Look, that's your grandpa.<br> Aw, Pat, would you believe it?<br> And Bob just a baby himself.<br> If you turn out half as good as the<br> blood that's in you, I'll not complain.<br> You know, Ma, it looks like Pa had...<br> sort of a roving eye for the ladies.<br> I'll thank you to keep a<br> civil tongue in your head.<br> Roving eye, ha! I'd like to catch him.<br> Look.<br> You're so good to me, the lot<br> of you. You'll have me in tears.<br> - Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry.<br> - Listen to him.<br> We'll play him a<br> tune, his favorite one.<br> - Come on, Ma, and play it.<br> - Come on, the four of you.<br> We'll show him a thing or two.<br> The O'Learys against the world.<br> The O'Learys against the world!<br> - We will. Come on, Ma.<br> You should've seen your father<br> dance, as light as a canary...<br> and stealing a kiss before<br> you could shut your eyes.<br> And the fair Molly Callahan<br> loving it, I'm thinking.<br> And why shouldn't I be loving it?<br> Himself as fine a man as ever stood<br> up with a girl in front of an altar.<br> And that's what you should be doin'.<br> - That's what I was telling him today.<br> - Is it herself, you mean?<br> I met Miss Fawcett. She's a<br> fine woman. You oughta know her.<br> Hmm. I will not. And her workin'<br> in a saloon like any hussy.<br> - Oh, that's not fair, Ma. We're living in modern times.<br> - That's right.<br> Don't forget, things have changed<br> since you were a girl. This is 1870.<br> Times may have changed,<br> but I haven't changed.<br> And I don't want any daughter-in-law<br> that's the talk of the town...<br> and kickin' her heels in<br> the air for anyone to see.<br> When you were a little one, no<br> bigger than that, and me over a tub...<br> I used to dream of the day when<br> you'd bring me home a sweet one...<br> and her all blushes, and<br> present me with fine grandsons...<br> as would be like sons<br> of my own, only sweeter.<br> It's my own life, Ma.<br> Who'll have some more beer?<br> - Me.<br> - I wouldn't mind another drop.<br> Here, Ma. Put a head on it.<br> Good evening, Mr. Jack. Will you<br> tell Mr. Dion his buggy's here?<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - He'll be right out.<br> Now, Ma, drink your beer and forget<br> about it, and let's go for a ride, huh?<br> Oh, sure. How about it, Ma?<br> - That I will.<br> - Oh, fine. I'll get your coat and hat.<br> Aw, Ma.<br> There you are.<br> Drink it all, Ma.<br> Come on, Ma.<br> Now, First Lady, I've got<br> a real surprise for you...<br> two of the fastest fillies<br> you ever sat behind.<br> Now, close your eyes and get inside.<br> Close 'em. Up one step. There you go.<br> Inside. Ma, this is Miss<br> Fawcett. This is Belle.<br> - Hmm! So it's a trick.<br> - No, wait a minute!<br> You're going to meet Belle, so you<br> might as well get used to the idea.<br> - The devil I will. Let me out.<br> - Ma, you always were so stubborn.<br> If you don't stop it, I'll give<br> you the licking of your life.<br> - Well, you don't think I'm gonna ride with her!<br> - Oh, come back here!<br> Sit down! Driver, drive on! Drive on!<br> Let me out! Let me out, I say!<br> - Sit still!<br> - Let me out! Stop it, I tell you!<br> I won't be treated this way!<br> You Irish lunkhead! What<br> do you think you're doing?<br> My son an Irish lunkhead? How'd you like<br> to be treated? You with your grand manners.<br> Just as any woman who's going to be<br> his wife has a right to be treated.<br> He'll never marry you. And now, if<br> you'll stop, I'll be takin' my leave.<br> - Stop here.<br> - Whoa!<br> - Wait. I'll get out.<br> - You'll do no such.<br> It's you who'll be saving<br> the wear and tear of walking.<br> - Ma.<br> - Hmm!<br> How could you?<br> I'm sorry. I didn't think<br> Ma would act like that.<br> Take me home, please.<br> My friends...<br> this campaign has resolved itself...<br> into one clear-cut issue.<br> Shall the Patch run Chicago...<br> or shall Chicago run the Patch?<br> I promise you that if I am elected...<br> the Patch will either be cleaned up...<br> or it will be wiped out like that.<br> Hooray for Gil Warren.!<br> - Who said that?<br> - Shh, shh.<br> - Oh, it's a shame.<br> - The trouble with him is he looks too honest.<br> People never trust an<br> honest man in office.<br> Well, I wish he hadn't tried it.<br> He'll never beat Warren.<br> Never say never about politics.<br> What are you up to now?<br> Well, I was just wondering<br> what would happen...<br> if all Gil Warren's ward heelers<br> and poll watchers and repeaters...<br> failed to show up on Election Day.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He wouldn't stand much chance of being elected, would he?<br> George, drive to<br> Commissioner Beavers'.<br> Gil Warren's my friend.<br> I won't do it. I can't.<br> I won't do it! I can't!<br> I'll be ruined forever.<br> For doing your duty? Oh, come,<br> come, Commissioner. Be a man.<br> He'll kill me.<br> Besides, what you're asking is against<br> the law, against all my principles.<br> You've been getting $100 a<br> week for doing what I tell you.<br> Every cent I got was in cash.<br> Sure, I paid you in cash, but I<br> always sent it by a different man.<br> What? What do you mean?<br> Those 15 or 20 people would make fine<br> witnesses if you ever got any ideas.<br> Blackmail, eh?<br> All right. I'll fight.<br> Go ahead. Fight.<br> And you'll be back pounding the pavement<br> so quick, it'll make your head swim.<br> Come on. He'll be there.<br> Hey, you! Where's your ticket?<br> - I'm with him.<br> - You know this guy?<br> - I never saw him before in my life.<br> - One of us is in error.<br> Outside, before I cloud<br> up and rain all over you.<br> - That severs our relationship.<br> - One of them Reform guys. They got no manners.<br> Belle, when you were<br> working for me at The Hub...<br> I bet you didn't think you'd be having the<br> first dance with the future mayor, did you?<br> Are you counting your chickens<br> before they're hatched?<br> - It's a lead pipe cinch.<br> - Oh.<br> You looking for me, Commissioner?<br> Hey, look what you done to my suit!<br> - Hey, what's the idea?<br> - Stop it!<br> Stop them, somebody.! Stop<br> them, somebody.! Stop them.!<br> Ladies and gentlemen!<br> The house is pinched!<br> Stay back!<br> Get back! You can't get out this way.<br> Can you beat that? And just when we<br> were beginning to have a little fun.<br> You let me catch you with that Colby<br> woman again, and you won't call it fun.<br> Come on, come on. Inside. Inside.<br> All right, take it away.<br> - What about it, chief?<br> - Yes, what about it?<br> It's all right, boys. It's all right.<br> You haven't got a thing to worry about.<br> I'll have you out of<br> here in no time at all.<br> - What about the bail?<br> - If it's bail they want, I've got it!<br> Better hurry, chief. The<br> polls are open already.<br> Don't worry. You'll be at your posts in<br> Sorry, Mr. Warren. Orders are to<br> hold them 24 hours without bail...<br> - On suspicion.<br> - What kind of suspicion?<br> - Suspicion of what?<br> - Just plain suspicion.<br> You can't do that. This is<br> Election Day. They're my workers.<br> By the Eternal, you've<br> got to let them go!<br> - It ain't up to me.<br> - I'll get the commissioner!<br> I'll get Senator Colby!<br> I'll get my lawyer! I'll<br> tear this town wide open!<br> - Where's Commissioner Beavers?<br> - Gone to the sanitarium.<br> - What sanitarium?<br> - I'm not allowed to give out his address.<br> Doctor's orders.<br> - Where's Judge Bender?<br> - Oh, the jud-jud-judge...<br> - I've got to see Judge Bender!<br> - Judge Bender left...<br> on a h-hunting<br> trip this m-morning.<br> All the jud-judges<br> in town went with him.<br> They're o-organizing<br> a h-hunting club.<br> - Then I've got to see Senator Colby.<br> - I'm afraid that's imposs...<br> You can't do it. See,<br> S-Senator Colby...<br> It's 12:00! The polls have been opened<br> six hours, and I'm tied hand and foot!<br> Every man in that jail controls at least<br> - What are we gonna do?<br> - We're gonna stop squawking.<br> - What's that?<br> - You're through. I've sold you out.<br> Don't try anything, Warren.<br> And now, if you'll excuse me,<br> I'll go and vote for my brother.<br> We O'Learys are a strange tribe.<br> Look at him. You know, he<br> really looks like a mayor.<br> Gee, I bet Ma feels great.<br> Dion, look at this!<br> Huh.<br> Huh, indeed.<br> Belle, we're friends, aren't we?<br> I hope so.<br> I've got a proposition<br> to put up to you.<br> It may startle you at first,<br> but I think you'll see my point.<br> I'm gonna clean out the Patch. I want<br> to be sure Dion doesn't oppose me.<br> - And you want me to help you?<br> - Exactly.<br> But after all, what<br> has it to do with me?<br> You know how things are down there.<br> Everything that's rotten in<br> Chicago comes out of the Patch.<br> The whole thing is an<br> atmosphere of vice and crime.<br> It's getting out of control,<br> and I'm gonna wipe it out.<br> How?<br> The law gives us the<br> right to condemn property.<br> The courts will have it<br> appraised and set a fair price.<br> It's what they call the right of eminent<br> domain. It's perfectly legal and fair.<br> But all of Dion's money is<br> tied up in The Senate. Mine too.<br> That's what's worrying me.<br> If he won't see it our<br> way, there'll be trouble.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Dion's a great person. He can<br> go anywhere, do anything...<br> if he only gets on the right track.<br> Belle, I want to see him marry you...<br> have a home and children, get<br> something real out of life.<br> Don't you think that's<br> what I've been hoping for?<br> That's what he wants too,<br> if he can only see it.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> He couldn't stand a<br> public investigation.<br> You know how he operates in the Patch.<br> I couldn't do a thing like that.<br> Believe me, Belle...<br> if I can't bring him to<br> his senses any other way...<br> I'll start an investigation<br> that'll crack this town wide open.<br> I'll use you as chief<br> witness against Dion...<br> let you tell the whole rotten story<br> of how he operates in the Patch.<br> How do you feel about that, Belle?<br> I just wanted Belle to<br> understand my position...<br> same as I want you to understand it.<br> - Dion, listen to Jack.<br> - I heard him. I know now where he stands.<br> You knew exactly where I<br> stood before the election.<br> I told you and I told<br> the people of this city.<br> - I elected you, not the people.<br> - You?<br> Sure. It was my idea. I sent<br> that committee to see you.<br> I paid for it, ran it, framed<br> it, threw Warren's men into jail.<br> I even voted for you.<br> I don't believe you.<br> Is that true?<br> - Yes. - I just wanted<br> it to look hunky-dory.<br> Why did you want me to be mayor?<br> Oh, a lot of reasons. I<br> wanted to see if I could do it.<br> Or maybe it was because I wanted<br> to see the smile on Ma's face...<br> when she rode with you in<br> the carriage election night.<br> All right. You elected<br> me, but I'm mayor.<br> Yes, you're mayor, but I'm Chicago.<br> I'd hate to have to kick you out.<br> Don't try it. A lot of<br> people like what I'm doing.<br> - What are you going to get out of this?<br> - Nothing.<br> But I happen to have sense enough to see<br> what Jack's after, even if you haven't.<br> - Now, wait a minute. Don't you two start...<br> - You keep out of this!<br> Well, of course, since<br> you've gone for Reform...<br> I guess we won't be seeing<br> very much of each other.<br> You're not gonna walk<br> out on Belle like that.<br> It seems that she's the one<br> that's done the walking out.<br> Dion. Dion!<br> Oh!<br> A grand jury investigation.!<br> Terrible.! Terrible.!<br> How did you ever get<br> involved in such a mess?<br> I wouldn't be a bit<br> surprised if you weren't...<br> in for a bit of sweatin'<br> yourself, Senator.<br> You've been milkin' the<br> Patch for a long time.<br> Me? Why I'll give you to understand,<br> sir, that my life is an open book.<br> Open or shut, brother, your<br> shirttail's out with the rest of us.<br> It's my daughter I'm thinking of.<br> I'll have to take her to<br> Europe, get her away from here.<br> - The trip would do her good.<br> - I'll have to ask you...<br> not to see my daughter again ever.<br> - To think I should be so deceived in the character...<br> - I've always wanted to see...<br> what a senator looks like...<br> when he gets a good,<br> swift kick in the pants.<br> - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?<br> - I'm hurrying, honey.<br> Miss Belle, you want this old plush?<br> Yes. No. Throw it away. I<br> don't care what you do with it.<br> Oh, this just fits in my trunk.<br> Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of<br> use in you carryin' on like this.<br> - Ain't no man worth it!<br> - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you?<br> I'm hurryin', honey.<br> - Get out of here!<br> - I'm gettin' out, honey.<br> - Get out of here!<br> - Belle, don't act like that.<br> Belle, I want to talk to you.<br> Hattie, get out of the way!<br> - Get him away from me!<br> - Get out of here, white man!<br> - Hattie, help me! Help me!<br> - Murder! Police! Help!<br> - Get out!<br> - Belle, please.<br> I'm sorry, but I had to come.<br> Just let me say one thing, then<br> you can put me out. I won't care.<br> - Oh, please go.<br> - I don't ask you to forgive me.<br> I've said and done things<br> no woman could ever forgive.<br> But you've got to<br> believe I love you, Belle.<br> I always have and I always will.<br> Oh, why talk about it?<br> But you said you loved me.<br> That's over.<br> You can't change in a<br> moment any more than I can.<br> We can't do without each other.<br> I can. I'll make myself.<br> Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll go<br> on fighting, but we'll do it together.<br> We were meant for each other.<br> Belle, marry me.<br> Now. Tonight.<br> I've got the license and the ring.<br> We'll go to Jack, have him marry us.<br> Will you, Belle?<br> Oh, my darling!<br> Come on, Mr. Policeman.<br> Right in here. She...<br> She's done backslid again.<br> Do you realize that 75% of<br> the buildings in the Patch...<br> are made of pine?<br> There are no sewers, no hydrants.<br> Nothing but filth, cesspools.<br> But worst of all, it<br> is a veritable firetrap.<br> Now, that sort of thing may have been<br> excusable when Chicago was just beginning...<br> but that time has passed.<br> Today it's a menace to a great city...<br> a cancer that must be cut out.<br> Now, I propose to condemn<br> the whole district...<br> wipe it out and start all over again.<br> Yes, what is it?<br> Tell him I'll be right out.<br> Will, uh, you gentlemen go<br> ahead with the discussion...<br> and excuse me for a<br> little while, please?<br> Yes, Mr. Mayor.<br> Well, Jack, you've won.<br> - I've won what?<br> - I've been a fool.<br> I wouldn't take a<br> million for this moment.<br> Now it's really the<br> O'Learys against the world.<br> Well, here's the little<br> lady who's responsible.<br> As if I didn't know it.<br> As the mayor of this great and<br> noble city, can you marry people?<br> Marry?<br> Why, sure!<br> Wait a minute. I'm not so sure.<br> But I'll find out.<br> What a mayor.<br> Is there anything in the charter about<br> whether the mayor can perform a marriage?<br> - I don't know, sir, but I'll find out.<br> - Hurry up and find out!<br> "Having taken these pledges of your<br> affection and vows of fidelity...<br> "I do, therefore, by right of<br> the authority in me vested...<br> "by the laws of the<br> state of Illinois...<br> "pronounce you, Dion<br> Patrick O'Leary...<br> "and you, Belle Catherine Fawcett...<br> lawfully married, husband and wife. "<br> That makes us kissing kin, doesn't it?<br> - I don't have to tell you how lucky you are.<br> - That's right.<br> - I just want to say congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> I wish you every happiness<br> and... good night.<br> Congratulations. Good night.<br> You'll never know how<br> much all this means to me.<br> Remember that day I told<br> you he wasn't so bad?<br> The O'Learys are a strange tribe.<br> Right.<br> Now, let's go home and tell Ma, huh?<br> Sure, but first there's just one<br> little matter I'd like to clear up.<br> And now, Mrs. O'Leary, suppose you<br> go ahead and testify against me?<br> Listen to him.<br> You didn't think I was gonna let<br> you two get away with it, did you?<br> - Why, Dion!<br> - Go ahead with your grand jury investigation.<br> She's my wife, and you know the law...<br> A wife cannot testify<br> against her husband.<br> Oh!<br> Belle, where are you going?<br> What do you think of that?<br> Why, you dirty...<br> I haven't licked you<br> since we were kids.<br> Of all the low, disgusting tricks<br> you ever pulled, this is the worst.<br> Well, you won't get away with it.<br> I'm gonna wipe out the<br> Patch and you along with it!<br> - Johnson!<br> - Yes, sir. I've sent for the police.<br> I don't want the police!<br> Get the city attorney!<br> Tell him to start the<br> condemnation proceedings.<br> And you get out of here! I never<br> want to see your face again!<br> Get the police commissioner. Tell<br> him to swear in 500 special deputies.<br> Get the newspapers. Tell them that<br> when I get through with the Patch...<br> - there won't be a stick or stone left standing.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hey, one at a time. Quit that nudging.<br> You'd think you never been fed before.<br> You're so full already, you oughta<br> be sleepin' it off on the parlor sofa.<br> Mutter, Mutter, komm schnell!<br> Stop that heathen<br> jabbering and talk sense!<br> Dion, Jack, they fight!<br> Bitte, Mutter, komm.!<br> The devil you say!<br> You can take one more nip while<br> I'm knockin' their heads together.<br> - Dion married Belle Fawcett.<br> - What?<br> Yeah, Jim Fellows just<br> came by to tell us.<br> Dion and Jack have had a knock-down,<br> drag-out fight about the Patch.<br> - And them grown-up and<br> brothers. - I'm gonna find 'em.<br> Wait. I'll go with you. And wait<br> till I get my hands on that Dion...<br> fightin' and marryin' that<br> creature behind my back.<br> Mrs. O'Leary! Mrs. O'Leary!<br> Oh, Mrs. O'Leary!<br> Your barn! Look! Look!<br> I didn't put the bar<br> between Daisy's legs.<br> Fire! Fire!<br> Get Daisy and the calf and the horse!<br> Get that baby back into the house!<br> Fire! Turn the alarm!<br> Fire! Turn the alarm!<br> Fire!<br> Come on, boys!<br> Never mind the barn! Let it go!<br> Save the house! The house!<br> Mrs. O'Leary, I'm gettin'<br> out everything that I can.<br> Mrs. Donovan, your<br> own house is a-goin'!<br> Me own house? Mrs. O'Leary,<br> me own house is a-burnin'!<br> - Get that cow!<br> - Come on, Daisy! Come on!<br> Get a hose over here.!<br> Come on.!<br> Giddyap.<br> - Chief!<br> - Dion!<br> Here I am, Pickle!<br> Dion, oh, Dion!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - There's a big fire in the Patch!<br> - Yeah? Where?<br> - DeKoven Street. The whole street's goin'!<br> You suppose that's some<br> of the mayor's doings?<br> Sure. The mayor's burning us out.<br> - He said he'd get us.<br> - Said he wouldn't leave a stick or a stone standing.<br> - Looks bad, boy.<br> - Yeah, burning us out, huh?<br> - Couldn't even wait for condemnation proceedings.<br> - I'll go with you.<br> No, you stay here. I've<br> gotta find out how Ma is.<br> Give the boys a drink. I'll<br> be back in half an hour.<br> He's asked for a fight.<br> Well, I'll give it to him.<br> Well, what'll you fellas have?<br> - I'll take some of this.<br> - Mighty funny business.<br> - What?<br> - Well, I'm not saying anything...<br> but I haven't got much faith in<br> these fights between brothers...<br> not when they're O'Learys.<br> They've pulled some pretty<br> smart tricks in the past...<br> and I wouldn't put it<br> past 'em to do it again.<br> You heard what Dion said! No one's gonna<br> burn him out, brother or no brother.<br> Well, I hope not. When I was running<br> things, nothing like this happened.<br> - Hmm! Come on, fellas.<br> - All right, boys. You heard what he said.<br> Spread the word. We'll have something<br> to say about bein' run out of the Patch.<br> Wait a minute. Get the boys together.<br> - Tell them that I said we'll meet at the armory.<br> - We'll get this Jack O'Leary!<br> Back up! Back up! I've<br> gotta get through! Back up!<br> Here, I think I can<br> make better time on foot.<br> All right, boys! Put<br> her on the other roof!<br> - Mommy!<br> - Mommy!<br> Mommy!<br> Mary!<br> All right, boys, pump!<br> It's moving might fast in this<br> wind, leaping ahead blocks at a time.<br> The Patch is like tinder.<br> There hasn't been a drop of<br> rain for nearly three months.<br> We've got to keep it away from the gas<br> works. We gotta keep it south of the river.<br> Have you any suggestions,<br> General Sheridan?<br> Yes. Make a firebreak<br> at the edge of the Patch.<br> Blow up that entire section<br> along Randolph Street.<br> - Fight this fire with dynamite!<br> - I authorize you to do everything possible to stop this fire.<br> Commissioner, mobilize<br> your whole force.<br> Swear in as many deputies as<br> you need. Clear that whole area.<br> - Requisition all the foodstuffs you need.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Donovan, you and Johnson get in touch<br> with Milwaukee, all the surrounding cities.<br> Ask them to send us all<br> the fire apparatus they can.<br> Wire Washington. Tell them we're gonna<br> need relief... money, medicine, troops.<br> - Keep me advised. I'll be with Gen. Sheridan.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Miss Belle, pull yourself together!<br> Come on, honey. Let's get<br> outta here. Come on, baby.<br> Pull yourself together. Let's get out<br> of here before judgment day gets us.<br> Come on, honey. Come on.<br> Bob! Bob! Where's Ma?<br> She's gone to the North Side with<br> Gretchen and the baby in the wagon.<br> They had to go. Our house<br> was the first to burn.<br> - Our house? Why, that dirty... Where did they start it?<br> - In our barn.<br> Ma heard about you fighting, she left the<br> lantern in there and Daisy kicked it over.<br> I thought Jack did it<br> to burn out the Patch.<br> That mob thinks so too.<br> We gotta get to him.<br> - Well, where is he?<br> - I don't know, but we've gotta stop that mob.<br> - Back up, I tell you!<br> - How can I back up?<br> Why can't you look where you're going?<br> Get that flea-bitten<br> thing out of here!<br> Come, darling, get<br> out. We have to walk.<br> Wait! I'll just be gettin' it.<br> I'll not be leavin' his<br> picture. It's all I've got left.<br> That fool cow!<br> Look out! The wall! It's falling!<br> Mutter.!<br> - Gretchen! Gretchen!<br> - Mutter.!<br> Gretchen!<br> Don't waste any time. Get<br> those people behind the line.<br> - Captain!<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Take all of your men you can spare.<br> Use some of mine if necessary.<br> Search every building. See that no<br> one is left behind. No one! Quickly!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Sergeant, move all police lines back<br> one full block and let no one through!<br> Hey, where are you going?<br> - I've got to get through to The Senate.<br> - Nobody's going through.<br> Mayor's orders. The streets<br> cleared. They're gonna dynamite.<br> - Dynamite?<br> - Yeah, to make a firebreak.<br> Come on, open up! Get back!<br> Back to the next corner!<br> - Come on. Back to the next block.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> I don't know. Jack! Jack!<br> Get back! Come on!<br> - I've gotta get through.!<br> - Jack! Jack, I...<br> Turn him loose. I'll take care of him.<br> Get away from here, you<br> dirty, contemptible liar.<br> I've stood for all I'm<br> gonna stand from you.<br> I've got work to do, and<br> nobody is gonna stop me.!<br> You've got to listen to me! Gil<br> Warren and his mob are out to get you!<br> Everybody down here thinks you set fire to<br> the Patch. They're organizing against you.<br> It's my fault. I thought so too.<br> - You lowdown,<br> good-for-nothing... - Jack!<br> Until I got home and found the<br> house burned to the ground...<br> - Ma, Gretchen and the baby gone.<br> - Where are they?<br> I put 'em in a wagon and<br> started them for the North Side.<br> They oughta be across<br> the river by now.<br> I'm sorry.

I'll look.<br> No. I'm gonna try the South Shore.<br> Mommy!<br> Mommy.!<br> Mommy.! Mommy.!<br> Mommy.!<br> Ma. Ma!<br> Ma! Ma!<br> Heaven be praised!<br> It's Dion! Oh, Dion!<br> - Oh, Ma!<br> - Dion!<br> - Oh, Ma!<br> - Oh, Dion, Dion!<br> - Ma!<br> - Are you hurt?<br> Come on. Come on up out of the wet.<br> - Oh, my child.<br> - Ma.<br> Where are the others?<br> Bob and Gretchen and<br> the baby are all right.<br> And Jack?<br> Oh, Ma.<br> He's dead?<br> - Did you make it up with him?<br> - Yes.<br> Then I'll not be weepin'.<br> It's the livin' that<br> need lookin' after.<br> Belle...<br> - Belle?<br> - What kind of a woman are you...<br> with that kind of a heart<br> and him your husband?<br> It's gone, and my boy's gone with it.<br> But what he stood for will never die.<br> It was a city of wood,<br> and now it's ashes.<br> But out of the fire<br> will be coming steel.<br> You didn't live to see it, my lad...<br> no more than your<br> father did before you.<br> God rest the two of you.<br> But there's Dion left, and<br> his children to come after.<br> He'll have his dream, Ma.<br> Nothing can lick Chicago, any<br> more than it could lick him.<br> Aye. That's the truth.<br> We O'Learys are a strange tribe.<br> There's strength in us.<br> And what we set out to do, we finish.<br>
