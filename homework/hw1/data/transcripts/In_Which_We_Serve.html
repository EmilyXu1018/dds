                        This is the story of a ship<br> (Cheering)<br> (Bosun's whistle)<br> Ship's company...'shun!<br> Turn aft, right and left.<br> Turn!<br> - Open fire!<br> - Open fire!<br> Shoot!<br> Look at the Huns, sir. They're jumping<br> overboard in full marching order.<br> Look at that. Come in, the water's lovely!<br> Look at'em. Somebody must have<br> blown a whistle. Layer on.<br> There are a lot more caques to port, sir,<br> and some bigger transports.<br> Shift to the big transports.<br> Aye aye, sir. Check, check, check.<br> Shift target right. Follow TBI.<br> (Explosion)<br> Can I fire torpedoes at the transports?<br> All right, get your old mouldies off,<br> but not more than two at any transport.<br> Flags, make to the division.<br> Train tubes to port.<br> - Ready port.<br> - Main office, make Tommy Tommy port.<br> (Explosion)<br> That's got'em!<br> - Shoot when you see the whites of their eyes.<br> - 0-3-5. 1-0 left<br> Bingo!<br> - Fire one!<br> - Fire one!<br> - Fire two!<br> - Fire two!<br> Torpedoes fired, sir.<br> Our fish have hit, sir,<br> and one transport has blown up.<br> There goes another.<br> Big stuff.<br> The rest of the division are doing well.<br> Must be an enemy destroyer, sir.<br> - Right, engage her.<br> - Aye aye, sir.<br> Check check check.<br> Shift target left Follow TBI.<br> Take this. It was my mother's.<br> Ah!<br> - Trainer on.<br> - Layer on.<br> - Left gun ready.<br> - Right gun ready.<br> I'll lay you 10-1 they're all Germans.<br> You'd never get the Macaronis to tackle<br> a job like that, not for love nor money.<br> The Eyeties will do anything for money.<br> Anything but fight.<br> That's why they were so lousy in the last war.<br> That's on account of their warm,<br> languorous southern temperament.<br> - Cocoa, sir.<br> - Thanks, Snotty.<br> Thank you.<br> Here comes the dawn of a new day, Flags.<br> It could be an uncomfortable one.<br> Yes, sir. It's a very pretty sky, sir.<br> Somebody sent me a calendar rather like that.<br> - Did it have a squadron of Dorniers on it?<br> - No, sir.<br> - That's where art parts company with reality.<br> - You're right, sir.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - Thanks.<br> Aircraft in sight astern, sir.<br> Angle of sight 2-0.<br> Looks like a couple of squadrons<br> of Junkers 88's.<br> - Starboard 20.<br> - Aye aye, sir. Starboard 20.<br> - One blast on the siren.<br> - Aye aye, sir.<br> (Siren)<br> Aircraft in sight, bearing green 1-7-0.<br> Angle of sight 2-0.<br> Short-range weapons.

Midships.<br> There's another wave on the port side, sir.<br> (Explosion)<br> - Hard a-starboard.<br> - Hard a-starboard, sir.<br> (Rapid gunfire)<br> The leader of this wave<br> is coming much lower, sir.<br> He'll probably hit our mast.<br> Well done.<br> We've got him, but I'm afraid he's got us too.<br> Midships.<br> Midships, sir.<br> - Carry on firing. Here comes the next wave.<br> - All guns are still in action.<br> Stop both.<br> No answer from the engine room, sir.<br> The telegraphs must be shot away.<br> I'm afraid we're going over.<br> Pass the word to cast loose the Carley floats.<br> (Gunfire and explosions)<br> Abandon ship!<br> (Echoing)<br> I'll sign for her now Ill sign for her now.<br> I'll sign for her now I'll sign for her now.<br> - Has Satterthwaite been sighted?<br> - No, sir, but it's just on ten o'clock.<br> (Banging)<br> Stop that hammering, Edgecombe.<br> I can't hear myself think.<br> Aye aye. sir<br> Tell No.1 to fall in the hands<br> on the quarterdeck.<br> Shall we have it on the desk or the shelf, sir?<br> Shelf. We'll have the usual one on the desk.<br> - Wedding dress, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> - It's here, sir.<br> - Good. Give it to me.<br> - Mr. Satterthwaite's coming on board, sir.<br> - Is No.1 bringing him down? Hands all aft?<br> (Knock at door)<br> Mr. Satterthwaite, sir.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Everything in order?<br> - Certainly.<br> We'd better get this little ceremony over.<br> - Were you satisfied with the trial?<br> - Yes, she's a well-found ship.<br> We'll be hoisting the ensign<br> in a couple of minutes, Edgecombe.<br> - Now, then.<br> - Are you prepared to take over the ship, sir?<br> Yes, I'll sign for her now.<br> Watch your head, sir.<br> Watch your head, sir.<br> Watch your head, sir.<br> (Klaxon)<br> - You can smoke if you like.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Will you have one, sir?<br> - No, thanks, not at the moment.<br> - Heard from your missus?<br> - I had a letter last week.<br> - One of the usuals, full of complaints.<br> - What's wrong?<br> Her mother was took bad<br> and had to go to hospital.<br> That old woman's always in trouble.<br> I think she enjoys it.<br> What's the matter with her?<br> Last time it was her back,<br> this time it's her stomach.<br> It seems she can't keep anything down.<br> It's not for want of trying.<br> - You'll be glad to be going to sea.<br> - To put it mildly, sir!<br> - Darling! I thought you were never coming.<br> - Everything under control?<br> Far from it. We've been in an uproar all day<br> since your telegram came.<br> Daddy!<br> Hello, Bobby.<br> - We've been waiting for hours.<br> - Mummy wanted us to go to bed.<br> - We saw the ship, Daddy.<br> - We took our tea on the cliffs and saw it go by.<br> - Not "it", Lavvy. Her.<br> - That's right.<br> She looked beautiful, Teddy.<br> How fast was she going? Was it 40 knots?<br> Good heavens, no. She was only doing 20.<br> - But she can do more than that, can't she?<br> - You bet she can.<br> Take the car round.<br> Then give Ellen a hand with dinner.<br> - Good evening, Edgecombe.<br> - Evening ma'am.<br> I hope it's a good dinner. I'm starving.<br> - Can I tell him what it is, Mummy?<br> - It's a surprise. She mustn't spoil it.<br> - Bobby, keep still. How long have you got?<br> - Till the morning.<br> Can we come to the dockyard?<br> No, son. We're commissioning,<br> making a rush job of it.<br> - But Mummy promised...<br> - That's enough. You heard Daddy.<br> But we shall be able to come on board<br> before you go, shan't we?<br> - Well, we'll make time somehow.<br> - When, Daddy? When?<br> Bobby, don't be so persistent.<br> Children, it's dreadfully late.<br> You really will have to go to bed.<br> Oh, Mummy.<br> Daddy will come up and say good night<br> if you're quick.<br> But I want to hear about the ship.<br> I'll tell you about it in the morning.<br> You can fire as many questions as you like.<br> Be good, do as your mother tells you,<br> and go to bed.<br> - Can I ask questions, too?<br> - You never do anything else.<br> Go on. Off you go, both of you.<br> - I'll be up in ten minutes. Promise.<br> - Promise?<br> - Are you coming up, too, Mummy?<br> - Yes.<br> Come on, Lavvy, I'll race you.<br> Wait. That's not fair!<br> They've been wild with excitement all day.<br> Darling, you must be exhausted.<br> I'll get you a drink.<br> Whisky and soda or a cocktail?<br> As it's a gala evening,<br> let's have a Kinross special.<br> I guessed it. It's all ready, only wants the ice.<br> I made a private bet<br> that you'd forget the Cointreau.<br> Wrong again.<br> I had a sort of feeling this was an occasion.<br> Were the trials satisfactory?<br> Were you pleased?<br> More than pleased. She's a lovely ship.<br> Does what she's told without a murmur.<br> Why are you making a rush job<br> of the commissioning?<br> - I like getting things done quickly.<br> - Is that the only reason?<br> We're living in strange times, darling.<br> It's as well to be prepared.<br> Yes, I suppose it is.<br> It's nothing to worry about.<br> No, of course not.<br> Here, try this. It may be a bit too sweet.<br> My love.<br> My love.<br> Just right, not a bit too sweet.<br> Miss me?<br> Of course not. I never gave you a thought.<br> What's the surprise for dinner?<br> Grouse. Maureen sent us a brace<br> from Scotland.<br> There's a girl of fine perception.<br> They're a bit high, but I expect you'll like that.<br> Is that a new dress?<br> Oh, no, darling. I've had it for ages.<br> - I swear I've never clapped eyes on it before.<br> - Only about 20 times, my love.<br> Perhaps it's you that looked new.<br> As good as new, anyway.<br> - Is there going to be a war, do you think?<br> - Yes, I think there is.<br> Oh.<br> No good worrying about it till it comes.<br> Not much good then, really.<br> No.<br> Don't be sad.<br> I'm not sad, really. I'm just sort of...<br> gathering myself together.<br> - Any more Kinross special left in the shaker?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> However busy you are, and however quickly<br> you've got to get your commissioning done,<br> I should like to come on board just once<br> before you go to sea to give the ship my love.<br> You'll have to.<br> My cabin's got to be made presentable.<br> - Is the chintz all right?<br> - First class.<br> Good. We'd better drink these up quickly<br> and go up to the children.<br> Dinner will be ready in a minute.<br> Here we go.<br> Here we go.<br> Swim to the float.<br> Swim to the float.<br> (Coughing and spluttering)<br> (Gunfire)<br> (Aircraft returns)<br> (Aircraft flies over)<br> Heave!<br> I've got some brandy in my Gieves.<br> Kath.<br> Kath.<br> Kath.<br> Here's the paper, dear.<br> I shan't have time<br> to do more than look at the headlines.<br> - There you are, then.<br> - It don't look too good, does it?<br> Oh, you can't believe anything they say.<br> Look at all the fuss we had last year.<br> Everybody flying about in aeroplanes<br> and making speeches.<br> After all that, nothing happened.<br> Nothing happened to us,<br> but a hell of a lot happened to other people.<br> - Do you really think we'll have another war?<br> - Looks like it.<br> Well, I'll believe it when I see it.<br> You may see it quicker than you bargained for.<br> I don't believe that Hitler'd be so silly.<br> What would he expect to gain by having a war?<br> World domination,<br> that's what that little rat's after.<br> They haven't got enough to eat in Germany<br> as it is.<br> Mrs. Blacket's nephew,<br> the one that travels in underwear,<br> came back from Berlin two months ago.<br> - He said they was all half-starved.<br> - I can't help what Mrs. Blacket's nephew says.<br> - I think we're for it.<br> - Well, if we have another war, I give up, see,<br> after all we went through last time.<br> All you went through? You was too young<br> and innocent to know about anything.<br> Don't talk so silly. You know perfectly well<br> how old I am, so don't pretend you don't.<br> You'll always be young and innocent to me.<br> Will I indeed, now?<br> If you ask me, you've got a hangover<br> from all that beer you put away last night.<br> I must be going.<br> - Is Mother coming down?<br> - I promised I'd call her. Wait a minute.<br> Mother? Walter's just going.<br> - You'd better come down as you are.<br> - That will be nice.<br> Will you get ashore after commissioning?<br> Before you go to sea, I mean.<br> That all depends. Don't forget<br> to put those bulbs in when the time comes.<br> - You and your bulbs!<br> - Goodbye, old girl.<br> Walter Hardy, whatever is the matter with you?<br> Anyone would think<br> you was going away for ever.<br> You never know.<br> You ought be ashamed of yourself, saying that.<br> And give them a piece of my mind.<br> Here comes Mother.<br> That spirit lamp of mine<br> will be the death of me yet.<br> - What's the matter with it?<br> - It blew up again. Frightened the wits out of me.<br> You will put in too much methylated.<br> What do you want to go fussing about<br> with spirit lamps in your bedroom for?<br> You could pop down to the kitchen.<br> Nobody'd notice.<br> I've made my own tea<br> in my own bedroom all my life.<br> I don't see any reason to stop now.<br> Yes, but that doesn't happen to be<br> your own bedroom. It's my spare.<br> If you go on blowing things up in it,<br> it won't be fit to sleep in.<br> Stop it, you two. I've got to go now.<br> A nice thing,<br> when my own daughter starts criticizing me.<br> Oh, shut up, Mother. Say goodbye to Walter.<br> That's what you came down for.<br> - Will you get ashore again?<br> - All depends on Hitler.<br> Who does he think he is, anyway?<br> That's the spirit! Goodbye, Mother.<br> Look after Kath for me.<br> Don't you two go nagging each other<br> from morning to night.<br> Nagging?<br> I like that, I must say.<br> Come on, Kath.<br> - Goodbye, old girl.<br> - Goodbye, dear.<br> Ship's company...'shun.<br> (Whistle)<br> - Ship's company present, sir.<br> - Thanks, No.1. Stand them at ease.<br> Ship's company, stand at... ease.<br> Break ranks and gather round me.<br> - Can you hear me all right at the back?<br> ALL: Aye aye, sir.<br> It's the custom for the captain to address<br> the ship's company on Commissioning Day<br> to give them his policy<br> and tell them the ship's programme.<br> Now, my policy's easy. If there are any here<br> who've served with me before, they'll know it.<br> Are there any old shipmates of mine here?<br> Oh, glad to see you again, Reynolds.<br> And Adams.<br> And Blake.<br> And Coombe.<br> Who's the small fellow behind the chief stoker?<br> Parkinson, sir.<br> Coxswain of the All Comers whaler<br> in the Valletta?<br> I was that, sir, when we won the cup<br> in the 1936 regatta.<br> And fell into the ditch when you got to the ship.<br> Well, there are enough old shipmates<br> to tell the others what my policy's always been.<br> Reynolds, Adams, Blake, Coombe, Parkinson,<br> what sort of a ship do I want the Torrin to be?<br> - A happy ship, sir.<br> - That's right.<br> An efficient ship, sir.<br> Correct.<br> A happy and efficient ship.<br> A very happy and a very efficient ship.<br> You might think I'm ambitious wanting both,<br> but in my experience,<br> you can't have one without the other.<br> A ship can't be happy unless she's efficient,<br> and won't be efficient unless she's happy.<br> Now for our programme.<br> You've seen the commissioning programme<br> published in Plymouth General Orders.<br> And you will have noted<br> that this allows the company three weeks.<br> Well, you've all read your papers.<br> Ribbentrop signed a non -aggression pact<br> with Stalin yesterday.<br> As I see it, that means war next week.<br> So I will give you not three weeks but exactly<br> three days to get this ship ready to sail.<br> None of us will turn in or take our clothes off<br> or sling our hammocks till the job's finished.<br> Then we'll send Hitler a telegram saying,<br> "The Torrin's ready. You can start your war."<br> You four bring in the sugar, you six gas masks,<br> and I'll join you and bring in the rum.<br> Wake up, England. You've had your hour.<br> It's my turn now.<br> RADIO: Here is an announcement.<br> At 11:15, that is, in about two minutes,<br> the Prime Minister will broadcast to the nation.<br> Please stand by.<br> (Bells chime)<br> CHAMBERLAIN: I am speaking to you<br> from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.<br> This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin<br> handed the German government a final note<br> stating that unless we heard from them<br> by 11 o'clock<br> that they were prepared at once<br> to withdraw their troops from Poland,<br> a state of war would exist between us.<br> I have to tell you now<br> that no such undertaking has been received<br> and that consequently<br> this country is at war with Germany.<br> You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me...<br> It ain't exactly a bank holiday for us.<br> She's still afloat.<br> Yes, sir.<br> ALIX KINROSS: God bless this ship<br> and all who sail in her.<br> God bless this ship and all who sail in her.<br> (Distant) # O hear us when we cry to thee<br> # For those in peril on the sea<br> # O Trinity of love and power<br> # Our brethren shield in danger's hour<br> # From rock and tempest, fire and foe<br> # Protect them wheresoe'er they go<br> # Thus evermore shall rise to thee<br> # Glad hymns of praise from land and sea<br> # Amen<br> Let us pray.<br> Eternal Lord God, who spreadest out<br> the heavens and rulest the raging of the sea,<br> who has compassed the waters with bounds<br> until day and night end,<br> be pleased to receive<br> into thy most gracious protection<br> the persons of us, thy servants,<br> and the fleet in which we serve.<br> Preserve us from the dangers of the sea<br> and the violence of the enemy,<br> that we may be a safeguard unto<br> our most gracious sovereign lord, King George,<br> and a security for such as pass on the seas<br> upon their lawful occasions.<br> That the inhabitants of our island may<br> in peace and quietness serve thee, our God,<br> and that we may return to enjoy the blessings<br> of the land with the fruits of our labours,<br> with the thankful remembrance of thy mercies<br> to praise and glorify thy holy name.<br> Through Jesus Christ our Lord...<br> Amen.<br> We will now sing the carol<br> on the back of the hymn card.<br> (Coughing)<br> # Good King Wenceslas looked out<br> # On the feast of Stephen<br> # When the snow lay round about<br> # Deep and crisp and even<br> # Brightly shone the moon that night<br> # Though the frost was cruel<br> # When a poor man came in sight<br> # Gathering winter fuel<br> # Hither, page, come stand by me<br> # If thou...<br> (Whistle)<br> (Laughter)<br> Them kids have been at it all day.<br> Beats me why their mothers let'em do it.<br> Oh, it's the Christmas spirit, Mum.<br> I'll give'em Christmas spirit, coming home<br> with their feet sopping, getting colds.<br> This is the time for goodwill towards all men.<br> Can't have you grumbling<br> as if it was an ordinary day.<br> Me grumble? Well, I like that, I must say.<br> I remember in the last war<br> spending Christmas in the Red Sea.<br> We was coming home from Aden.<br> Hot? You could have fried an egg on the deck.<br> The Red Sea is hot, all right.<br> So's the Persian Gulf.<br> I was out there two years ago.<br> The fridge went wonky and everything went bad,<br> including the language.<br> You certainly see life in the big ships.<br> We don't do so badly in the small ones.<br> Oh they're off again. Stop'em somebody.<br> I'm not starting anything.<br> It's a darned sight more lively in a big cruiser.<br> It stands to reason.<br> It don't do no such thing.<br> You're a Marine.<br> You don't know nothing about destroyers.<br> What's the matter with the Marines?<br> Well, Bert, I'm afraid I'll have to tell you.<br> - Where would the Navy be without us?<br> - Without a Navy, there wouldn't be no Marines.<br> Oh, shut up, you two. Who cares anyway?<br> That's a nice way to talk, and no mistake!<br> You, the mother of a sailor.<br> - And the mother-in -law of a Marine.<br> - Pass the port wine and don't talk so silly.<br> - I'm as dry as a bone.<br> - Mum's right. What's the sense in arguing?<br> We was only having a friendly discussion.<br> You'll be saying next it was a friendly discussion<br> last night in the Green Man.<br> Why, you had the whole place in an uproar!<br> Bert, I give you a toast.<br> The Royal Marines - God bless'em and<br> a happy Christmas to every man jack of'em.<br> The Royal Marines.<br> Thanks, Shorty, old man.<br> I respond to your toast in a fitting manner.<br> On behalf of my corps,<br> of which I am justly proud...<br> Hear, hear.<br> ...I give you destroyers,<br> and the Torrin in particular.<br> - May her shadow never grow less.<br> - It never will.<br> Destroyers and HMS Torrin.<br> I should like to take the opportunity<br> of this festive occasion<br> to drink the healths of one and all present,<br> and to thank a kindly fate for so arranging<br> that my ship should have to come home<br> for boiler cleaning two days before Christmas -<br> a bit of luck which any sailor would tell you<br> is little short of a bloody miracle.<br> Walter, how can you?<br> You know I don't like you using that word.<br> Be that as it may, Kath,<br> that's a highly expressive word.<br> It's been bound up with naval tradition<br> since times immemorial.<br> I have heard it whispered in the RAF.<br> Well, be that as it may, I would like to add<br> that I consider we're all...<br> ...very lucky...<br> ...to be together on this happy day,<br> taking into account there's a war on<br> and civilization happens to be trembling<br> on the edge of an abyss.<br> - There, now.<br> - What did you say, Kath?<br> I only said, "There, now."<br> Well, don't say it again.<br> You know it only puts me off.<br> What are you giggling about, Freda,<br> if I may make so bold?<br> Nothing, really. It's just the way you talk.<br> What you young flibbertigibbets don't realise<br> is that this is a very important war indeed.<br> War or no war, you certainly like listening<br> to the sound of your own voice.<br> Oh, let him get on with his speech, Kath.<br> Try and stop him.<br> I will treat these paltry interruptions<br> with the contempt they deserve,<br> and go on to propose the health<br> of one who is very dear to me.<br> She's a creature of many moods<br> and fads and fancies.<br> She is, to coin a phrase, very often uncertain<br> and coy and hard to please.<br> But I'm devoted to her<br> with every fibre in my being,<br> and I hereby swear to be true to her<br> in word and deed, so help me God.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, HMS Torrin.<br> ALL: HMS Torrin.<br> (Tapping on table)<br> Ladies and gentlemen, the King.<br> ALL: The King.<br> - We can smoke now, can't we?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> You promised to pull the first one with me.<br> Come on. Take a strong grip and pull.<br> Come on, old girl.<br> - Enjoying yourself?<br> - Very, very much.<br> That cap's absolutely wizard.<br> You ought to have a hat made like it.<br> Doesn't the tree look sweet?<br> Alix and I spent hours fixing it.<br> This is the best Christmas I've ever had.<br> - Is it?<br> - Stop whispering, you two.<br> You really oughtn't<br> to have put them next to each other.<br> We ought to drink to them.<br> Come on, everybody.<br> To the newly betrothed.<br> ALL: The newly betrothed.<br> - What's betrothed, Daddy?<br> - The beginning of the end, my boy.<br> On behalf of my fiance and myself,<br> thank you very kindly.<br> As Flags and Maureen are so bashful,<br> I think that you should make a speech, Alix.<br> - Oh, no, honestly, I couldn't.<br> - Come on, Alix. I'll support you.<br> Oh, Teddy, I shall never forgive you for this.<br> Oh, dear!<br> - What am I to say? Just you wait.<br> - Happy Christmas.<br> Come on, now. Silence, everybody.<br> The Lady Mayoress<br> is about to declare the bazaar open.<br> Don't let him get you down, Alix.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I'll begin by taking my husband's advice...<br> - Hooray!<br> ...and wishing you all a very happy Christmas.<br> I'm sure Elizabeth and June will back me up<br> when I say I am going to deliver,<br> on behalf of all wretched naval wives,<br> a word of warning to Maureen,<br> who has been unwise enough<br> to decide to join our ranks.<br> Hear hear!<br> Dear Maureen,<br> we all wish you every possible happiness,<br> but I think it only fair to tell you in advance<br> exactly what you are in for.<br> Shame, shame.<br> Speaking from bitter experience,<br> I can only say that the wife of a sailor<br> is most profoundly to be pitied.<br> To begin with, her home life,<br> what there is of it, has no stability whatever.<br> She can never really settle down.<br> She moves through a succession<br> of other people's houses,<br> flats and furnished rooms.<br> She finds herself having to grapple<br> with domestic problems<br> in Bermuda, Malta or Weymouth.<br> We will not deal with the question of pay.<br> That is altogether too painful.<br> What we will deal with<br> is the most important disillusionment of all.<br> - And that is...<br> - Stop her, somebody. This is rank mutiny.<br> And that is, that wherever she goes,<br> there is always in her life<br> a permanent and undefeated rival.<br> Her husband's ship.<br> Whether it be a battleship or a sloop,<br> a submarine or a destroyer,<br> it holds first place in his heart.<br> It comes before wife, home,<br> children, everything.<br> Some of us try to fight this<br> and get badly mauled in the process.<br> Others, like myself,<br> resign themselves to the inevitable.<br> That is what you will have to do,<br> my poor Maureen.<br> That is what we all have to do<br> if we want any peace of mind at all.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I give you my rival.<br> It's extraordinary<br> that anyone could be so fond...<br> ...and so proud of their most implacable enemy.<br> This ship.<br> God bless this ship, and all who sail in her.<br> Well... she did her stuff, sir.<br> Best ship I ever served in, sir.<br> That goes for me too, sir.<br> It makes one feel sort of lost, doesn't it?<br> A very happy and a very efficient ship, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> (Snivels)<br> Wipe your face, Edgecombe.<br> You don't want oil fuel in your eyes.<br> Aye aye, sir.<br> Well... do you know what I'd like now?<br> Anice hot cup of tea.<br> I'd like a nice beer myself.<br> Look out! Here come the bastards back again.<br> Keep your heads down, get as low as you can!<br> Missed, butterfingers!<br> Blimey. I spoke too soon.<br> - Aargh!<br> - Did it get you badly?<br> Don't rightly know, sir.<br> Knife, somebody.<br> Cut his sleeve carefully.<br> Hit a mother with a baby in her arms, you would.<br> Oh, look, boys.<br> Shot through the heart.<br> - I always did hate the sight of blood.<br> - Give us a rag, somebody.<br> What's your name? What's your name?<br> What's your name? What's your name?<br> What's your name? What's your name?<br> What's your name?<br> Quite a loving cup, isn't it?<br> You never know your luck.<br> I always say travel broadens the mind.<br> Now then, saucy.<br> You keep your hands to yourself.<br> - Want a drop, dear?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Come on. It won't hurt you.<br> I'd rather not, thanks all the same. I don't like it.<br> Oh, fancy that, now! Ever so sorry, I'm sure.<br> If she doesn't want it,<br> she doesn't have to have it.<br> Who do you think you are, anyway?<br> Father Flanagan?<br> Here, play a hymn, there's a dear.<br> I didn't know we was in Sunday school.<br> Some people don't know<br> when they've had enough.<br> What was that you said?<br> You heard. You ain't got cloth ears.<br> Here, miss, you change places with me.<br> - It's all right, really.<br> - You'll be more comfortable in the corner.<br> I'd be ever so much obliged, I'm sure,<br> if you'd change places with me, too.<br> My mother always warned me<br> never to sit next to sailors.<br> Pity she didn't warn you<br> about a few other things while she was at it.<br> Ah, shut up arguing, pal. Here, have a fag.<br> Life's too short.<br> # If you were the only<br> # Girl in the world<br> # And I was the only boy<br> # Nothing else would matter in the world today<br> # We could go on loving...<br> Comfy?<br> Yes, thanks.<br> What's your name?<br> Freda. Freda Lewis.<br> Freda? It's a pretty name, isn't it?<br> - Is it?<br> - Do you mind if I smoke?<br> Of course not.<br> - Have one?<br> - I don't mind.<br> These are special, HM ships only.<br> We get'em in the canteen.<br> My uncle by marriage is in the Navy.<br> He's on a destroyer.<br> Isn't that a coincidence, now? So am I.<br> There, now.<br> He's a petty officer.<br> They call him by a funny name.<br> We often call petty officers funny names.<br> - It begins with a B.<br> - It generally does.<br> Oh, you are awful!<br> What's his ship?<br> I'm not supposed to tell you that, am I?<br> It's careless talk.<br> You can tell me.<br> I'm in the same firm, as you might say.<br> Well, chief buffer, that's what he's called.<br> He's on the Torrin.<br> Well, it's a small world, and no error!<br> Here, Joey.<br> Our chief buffer's her uncle by marriage.<br> Makes you sort of Siamese twins.<br> This is my friend Joey Mackeridge.<br> Miss Lewis.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Pleased to meet you, I'm sure<br> What's your name?<br> - Funny us meeting like that, wasn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Sort of... unexpected.<br> - Yes.<br> That long train, all them people in it,<br> and I had to pick on that one carriage.<br> - It's fate, I shouldn't wonder.<br> - Yeah, I feel that way, too.<br> - I suppose we ought really to be going now.<br> - Yeah, I suppose we ought.<br> Your family will be wondering<br> what's happened to you.<br> - Well, I'm wondering that myself.<br> - How can you?<br> Does er... Does your aunt let you go out much?<br> She doesn't mind,<br> so long as I don't get back too late.<br> What about tomorrow?<br> We might go to the Palais de Danse.<br> - Do you like dancing?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, that's a date, then.<br> You don't waste much time, do you?<br> - I can't afford to. I've only got weekend leave.<br> - That's not long.<br> Well, here we are.<br> Come in and meet my mum and dad.<br> No, not now. I'd really rather not.<br> I've got to be getting along.<br> - And they wouldn't want a stranger butting in.<br> - You're not a stranger, not any more.<br> Ah, but to them I would be.<br> Give me that bag, there's a dear.<br> Not until you say it's OK about tomorrow night.<br> - Oh, you are awful!<br> - 6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.<br> All right.<br> Cross your heart and hope to die?<br> I cross my heart and hope to die.<br> - So long, Freda.<br> - So long, Shorty.<br> (Clattering)<br> (Whistles) Mum.<br> Shorty Blake!<br> You ought to be ashamed of yourself,<br> and no mistake.<br> Your telegram only arrived half an hour ago.<br> You never said what time you was coming.<br> I'm here, aren't I? Sound in wind and limb.<br> You can't grumble.<br> Oh, you bad boy, you!<br> May, Shorty's home!<br> Dad! Dad!<br> Doesn't he look well?<br> How's the war going, son?<br> See any submarines?<br> Hundreds. Sunk 14 last week,<br> and a couple of cruisers thrown in.<br> Oh, Mum, he's fibbing, isn't he?<br> In the last war, I was in a convoy once.<br> Put a sock in it, Fred.<br> We've heard quite enough<br> about all what you did in the last war.<br> - Dad?<br> - Yes, old man?<br> Where did you first meet Mum?<br> Why, whatever made you think of asking that?<br> We was in a train coming back from Herne Bay.<br> Well, it's a small world, and no error!<br> Mum, can I leave my bridge out<br> while Shorty's home?<br> It was fate, wasn't it?<br> You drink your tea up, my lad,<br> and don't talk so soft.<br> They're coming over again.<br> Get down.

Mrs. Blake.<br> Oh, it does sound funny, doesn't it?<br> You'll get used to it.<br> There's one thing I shall never get used to,<br> and that's you going away.<br> It's your own fault for marrying a sailor.<br> That's fairly asking for trouble, that is.<br> Can't trust any of'em an inch.<br> Wives in every port.<br> Coming home unexpected<br> and catching you having tea with the lodger.<br> I'm the one that will be the lodger<br> if I'm going to live with Kath.<br> That isn't for a whole week yet. Think of it.<br> Seven whole days of glorious life.<br> You'll like being with Kath, won't you?<br> Of course I shall.<br> It's you being away and me wondering<br> what's happening to you that I won't like.<br> Proceed with the following operations:<br> And 4: Give us another kiss.<br> Now, then, ship's company...'shun!<br> Oh, lay off, Shorty!

Congratulations.<br> Thank you, sir. This is my wife, Mrs. Blake.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.<br> Alix, come and meet my shipmate and his wife.<br> They've just been married.<br> Ordinary Seaman Blake, Mrs. Blake - my wife.<br> - How do you do? I hope you'll be very happy.<br> - Thanks ever so.<br> But we're old friends. He practically<br> saved my life when I came on board.<br> My foot slipped on the gangway,<br> and I nearly fell overboard. Do you remember?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Will you live in Plymouth?<br> Yes... that is, when he goes to sea again.<br> Chief Petty Officer Hardy's<br> her uncle by marriage, sir.<br> She's going to live at their place for the duration.<br> But we're spending the next few days<br> in Torquay.<br> Very nice, too. You begin as you intend<br> to go on, Mrs. Blake. Keep him in order.<br> My wife rules me with a rod of iron.<br> It's been quite successful so far.<br> Don't talk such nonsense.<br> I'm never allowed to have my own way.<br> Well, we won't interrupt you any longer.<br> Report him to me if he doesn't behave.<br> - Goodbye. The very best of luck.<br> - Thanks very much.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye for the present, sir.<br> - Have a good time. Enjoy your leave.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Coincidence them going to Torquay<br> for their honeymoon.<br> I thought that at the time,<br> but I didn't want to go on about it.<br> That first quarrel we had, remember?<br> When you went stamping off<br> to listen to the band and came back in tears.<br> It was only because they were playing<br> The Blue Danube.<br> That always makes me feel<br> pent-up and emotional.<br> That wasn't why you were in tears.<br> Don't pretend it was.<br> If I was in tears at all, which I hotly deny,<br> it was because that was when I discovered<br> what a disagreeable character you have.<br> Still, it was a good honeymoon,<br> as honeymoons go.<br> It went awfully quickly.<br> (Whistles The Blue Danube)<br> Stop it, Teddy. I refuse to be made sentimental<br> in the middle of a Great Western lunch.<br> Eat up your delicious piece of railway fish<br> and behave yourself.<br> - Damn!<br> - What's the matter?<br> That thing positively haunts me.<br> I'd have given my eyeteeth for a show like that.<br> Never mind, darling.<br> There'll be lots of other shows and<br> lots of other chances before the war's over.<br> (Wind howls)<br> Some damned poet at some time or other<br> wrote a very appealing little piece<br> about "the tiny feet of the rain".<br> There's a man I'd like to meet. I'd kill him.<br> Well, I'm going down to the wardroom.<br> Keep a stiff upper lip, old boy.<br> (Laughter)<br> Five on six,<br> two on three,<br> and ten - just what the doctor ordered.<br> The Doctor hasn't ordered a damn thing,<br> apart from a few doses of Cascara<br> and one splint since the ship commissioned.<br> That, I may say,<br> is what's getting the Doctor down.<br> Years of expensive medical training<br> resulting in complete atrophy.<br> The doctor wishes he was dead.<br> Someone give the Doctor a drink.<br> - Mitchell, a glass of port for the Doctor.<br> - Thank you.<br> There, just the girl I wanted.<br> - You do have the damnedest luck.<br> - Skill, old boy, sheer undiluted skill.<br> The usual triumph of mind over matter.<br> - It's a stinking awful night.<br> - Hello, No.1.<br> Mitchell, a gin for the First Lieutenant.<br> Thanks, Torps.<br> The sea is getting up<br> and I've got the middle watch.<br> Hey, stop. You should put the ten on the nine.<br> I never noticed the damn thing!<br> Here's peace, peace, perfect peace,<br> with loved ones far away.<br> - Feeling all right, old man?<br> - Yes. Why?<br> - Sure you're not running a temperature?<br> - No, of course not.<br> First time you haven't been late for a watch<br> since we commissioned.<br> - You're two minutes early.<br> - I'm sorry, sir. It won't occur again, sir.<br> Bearing green 3-0, vessel on fire.<br> (Bell)<br> Yes?<br> - Captain, vessel on fire, bearing green 3-0.<br> - Press the alarm rattlers.<br> (Rings)<br> Come on.<br> I was dreaming I was in a Turkish harem<br> and some fathead<br> has to go and sound off action stations.<br> I wondered why you was pinching me.<br> Report to TS<br> when closed up and cleared away.<br> Looks like a line of destroyers.<br> Number one gun cleared away.<br> Number two gun cleared away.

Here she comes.<br> What's the damage, No.1?<br> Mess deck bulkheads are being shored up.<br> It looks as if they're all right.<br> But there's a good deal of damage aft.<br> We'll be a nice sitting target when it gets light.<br> Is Captain D alive?<br> Yes, old chap. You haven't succeeded<br> to the command of this flotilla yet.<br> - What did you do to Jerry?<br> - Sunk one.<br> The rest escaped in a smoke screen<br> and one was badly damaged.<br> Not too bad.<br> Tell Tancred to take me in tow.<br> Aye aye, sir.<br> How far are we from home, Pilot?<br> About 120 miles, sir.<br> Snotty, ask the First Lieutenant<br> if he's all ready to tow for'ard.<br> - We have all the guns working in hand, sir.<br> - Good. We shall need'em, I expect.<br> Well, Blake. Don't move.<br> How are you feeling?<br> Fine, sir, thank you.<br> Got concussed a bit, didn't you?<br> Yes, sir. I think I did, sir.<br> The First Lieutenant tells me<br> that you stood by the gun<br> even when most of the crew were knocked out.<br> Well, sir... somebody had to do it, sir.<br> - You did damn well. I'm very proud of you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I want to see my captain.<br> It's all right, old man. I'm here.<br> Don't try to talk. Just rest.<br> (Explosion)<br> (Rapid gunfire)<br> Are the bulkheads holding all right?<br> Yes, sir, they're taking it very well.<br> How far have we made good the last two days?<br> We're about halfway there, sir.<br> The RAF ought to be here soon.<br> A nice nippy little fighter squadron,<br> that's what we want.<br> - I wish they'd get a move on.<br> - Give'em time, old boy.<br> I'm sick of wallowing about here<br> like a sitting duck.<br> Hurray! Bravo!<br> (Cheering)<br> Bravo!<br> Hooray!<br> (Cheering)<br> Make yourselves comfortable.<br> We're all pretty tired.<br> There are one or two things I want to say.<br> First...<br> First, I'll hold<br> a short memorial service next Sunday<br> for our 36 shipmates who lost their lives,<br> and return thanks that the old ship<br> came through with so many of her complement.<br> I expect that Hitler is conferring the Iron Cross<br> on the man who claims to have sunk us.<br> Secondly, I want to tell you<br> that you all did pretty well<br> in the trying time we've been through.<br> When a torpedo hits<br> so small a ship as a destroyer,<br> the result is bound to be fairly devastating,<br> if not fatal.<br> And I can understand<br> the tremendous temptation<br> to think of your own skin first<br> and the ship and your shipmates second.<br> I suppose, in a way, it's gratifying to feel<br> that out of a ship's company of 244 men,<br> as I hoped and expected they would.<br> One man, however, did not.<br> That man has been charged<br> with leaving his post without permission.<br> I needn't tell you how serious<br> an offence of this nature is in time of war,<br> nor how drastic is the punishment<br> that normally follows.<br> You will be surprised, therefore, to learn<br> that I have let him off with a caution.<br> Or perhaps I should say with two cautions -<br> one to him, and one to me.<br> For in a way,<br> I feel that what happened was my fault.<br> This man has only been in the Navy<br> for six months.<br> He has only been in this ship for two months.<br> Even so I feel that in that time<br> I should have been able to make it clear to him<br> that I did not expect<br> and would not tolerate such behaviour.<br> I feel I should have been able to get at least<br> that much of my creed across, but I failed.<br> I will not punish a man for an action<br> for which I must hold myself largely to blame.<br> But I should like you all to know<br> that after this, there will be no more cautions.<br> The next time we run into trouble -<br> and as leader of a striking force,<br> this ship's bound to be in more scraps -<br> I know that, come what may,<br> no-one will fail to do his duty to the very end.<br> Thank you all for making my task so easy,<br> and the Torrin a ship to be so very proud of.<br> - Carry on, No.1.<br> - Aye aye, sir.<br> Ship's company...'shun.<br> Turn for'ard Dismiss.<br> Look here, I've got to close up now.<br> It's no use your staying on any longer.<br> You can't have any more to drink.<br> It's after hours.<br> What's the matter with having some music?<br> If you've got a penny, you can have it.<br> If not, you can't.<br> I have.<br> Well, put it in the slot, then.<br> That's what it's there for.<br> I will.<br> (Pianola plays Run Rabbit Run)<br> Will you be requiring anything more<br> before we close?<br> Look here, miss. Judging by all<br> I've had tonight, I ought to be drunk, see.<br> I want to be drunk.<br> I want to be drunk more than<br> I've ever wanted anything in my whole life.<br> Who says sailors don't care?<br> #... farmer his fun, fun, fun<br> # He'll get by without his rabbit pie<br> # Run, rabbit, run, rabbit<br> # Run, run, run<br> # Run, rabbit, run, rabbit...<br> Oh, play another tune, for God's sake!<br> Anything to oblige.<br> (Plays Roll Out The Barrel)<br> #... the barrel<br> # We'll have a barrel of fun<br> # Roll out the barrel<br> # We've got the blues on the run<br> # Zing boom tararrel<br> # We'll have a bowl of good cheer<br> # Now's the time to roll...<br> # Now the gang's all here.<br> All together, boys.<br> # Roll out the barrel<br> # We'll have a barrel of fun<br> # Roll out the barrel<br> # We've got the blues on the run<br> # Zing boom tararrel<br> # Sing out a song of good cheer<br> # Now's the time to roll the barrel<br> # For the gang's all here<br> (Cheering)<br> Bravo! Bravo!<br> (Whistling)<br> Well... goodbye, Walter.<br> Goodbye, Freda.<br> Don't go overexerting yourself, now.<br> - Cheerio, Kath.<br> - Be good.<br> Go on, Freda. Go on up to the gate with him.<br> I'll wait here.<br> You shouldn't have come. It's bad for you.<br> Don't be silly.<br> It would be much worse sitting at home.<br> Besides, we've had an extra half-hour together.<br> It doesn't seem so bad this time, somehow.<br> Perhaps I'm getting used to it.<br> Come on, give us a kiss and hop it.<br> No sense hanging about.<br> All right.<br> Now, then. None of that.<br> Go on. Be a good boy. Don't get your feet wet.<br> I won't forget about having the mower mended.<br> That's right. And if things do get bad,<br> you can always go to Dorothy's.<br> They'll have to be good and bad<br> before I do that.<br> - All right, obstinate. Cheerio.<br> - Cheerio.<br> You know what you can do<br> with all your Packards and all your Cadillacs.<br> Give me a Rolls-Royce every time.<br> You're old-fashioned, that's what you are.<br> Time marches on, you know.<br> - What does the King have?<br> - A Daimler.<br> I suppose you think that's old-fashioned.<br> Well, so it is,<br> compared to a snappy 1940 Packard.<br> You couldn't have the King<br> whizzing along the streets in a flash roadster.<br> Who said anything about roadsters?<br> I said before, and I'll say it again,<br> there is nothing on land or sea<br> to touch a good old conservative British make.<br> Give me a Daimler every time.<br> You wanted a Rolls-Royce just now.<br> You can't have both. Looks like profiteering.<br> - Look here, old man...<br> - Oh, give it a rest.<br> I will.<br> How do you spell porpoise?<br> P-O-R-P-O-U-S, I suppose. Why?<br> I've told my missus<br> we've been escorting a convoy of'em.<br> Anybody seen the Chief<br> after the royal raspberry he got this morning?<br> - Poor old Chiefy.<br> - He hasn't been in to lunch yet.<br> - Hello, Chief. We were just talking about you.<br> - Damned nice of you.<br> - Made any more filthy vapours?<br> - Shut up, Guns. I've had enough of that.<br> I thought it looked very attractive, all that<br> dense black smoke belching from the funnel.<br> - I'll thank you all to lay off it.<br> - Never mind, Chiefy.<br> Old Tremoyne went one better<br> at about ten o'clock.<br> - I thought she was on fire.<br> - Bring me some food, Mitchell.<br> Have your sparkers picked up any titbits<br> about the war?<br> Not since yesterday. Pretty bad show.<br> My young brother's in the BEF.<br> He wasn't far from GHQ in Arras.<br> - God knows where he is now.<br> - The whole thing's been a lash-up.<br> You all know what we've got to do,<br> don't you?<br> The whole British Expeditionary Force<br> is falling back on Dunkirk.<br> Now, in peacetime, as you know, there's<br> a lot of leg-pulling between the services.<br> But the soldiers are our brothers in arms<br> and it's up to us to get'em off<br> so they can live to fight again.<br> Let them see how much we admire<br> the way they fought. And don't forget,<br> the success of our evacuation is measured<br> by the smallness of the military casualties,<br> not the naval ones.<br> The soldiers are our guests,<br> and their lives will be in our hands.<br> (Dive bomber approaches)<br> (Explosion)<br> (Dive bomber roars overhead)<br> Gangway, please<br> Gangway. Here we are. Excuse me.<br> Mind your backs.<br> Here you are, cock.<br> Wet and warm. Don't examine it too closely.<br> Hold on, Joey. Hold on.<br> Here you are, mate.<br> Try dipping the biscuit in the cocoa.<br> You can't hurt the cocoa<br> and you can save your teeth.<br> The champagne will be along in a minute.<br> That'll be hot, too.<br> Come on, Joey, up this way.<br> Mind your backs, please.<br> A woman's work is never done.<br> Here you are, mate.<br> Coming up. Here you are.<br> Here, don't you want none?<br> Can't hold it, son. My hand's gone wonky.<br> Half a mo. Here, Joey,<br> give us a couple of them biscuits.<br> - Here, don't gulp it, now. You'll choke yourself.<br> - Thanks, son.<br> (Bomb whistles)<br> (Explosion)<br> (Gunfire)<br> Why did we never think of this for elevenses<br> in the mess? It's damned good.<br> It's just Bovril rather heavily laced with sherry.<br> (Explosion)<br> Port 20.<br> How's the old country looking now?<br> I feel as if I've been away for years.<br> We've been away quite a while, too.<br> We put in up north every now and again<br> to refuel.<br> The country's looking much the same as usual<br> the last time I saw it.<br> Gentle, you know. Not exactly smug,<br> but not exactly warlike, either.<br> There'll always be an England, eh?<br> S u bboso that's as good a conviction as any<br> - A good deal better than most, sir.<br> - What?<br> A good deal better than most...<br> (Drowned out by dive bomber)<br> Here you are, chum.<br> Here's a nice cup of cocoa.<br> Want a biscuit?<br> Go on, leave it. He might fancy it later.<br> I never thought I'd be so glad<br> to see a cup of cocoa.<br> That's right, chum, have another go.<br> Come on, it's better with your boots off.<br> What a swallow! Lovely. Have some more.<br> We're getting quite close.<br> Good old white cliffs of Dover.<br> Look better with the sun on them.<br> Still, can't have everything.<br> - Damned lucky to see them at all.<br> - Quite right.<br> Haven't had a chance to thank you, Kinross.<br> The Navy's put up a fine show.<br> I hope you don't think we're not grateful.<br> - Perhaps you'd care to dine one night.<br> - Thanks. I'd love to.<br> We'd better get below, Jasper,<br> and start lining up the troops.<br> I expect you'll be wanting to push off<br> as soon as possible.<br> You've struck rather a busy day.<br> - Goodbye for the present.<br> - Forgive me for not coming down.<br> - Goodbye, sir. Thanks very much.<br> - Goodbye. Good luck.<br> - Just ordinary Bovril and sherry?<br> - Just ordinary Bovril and sherry.<br> Good. Thanks.<br> Battalion... sling your arms.<br> Battalion...<br> ...'shun!<br> Turn to the left in threes.<br> Left... turn.<br> By the right, quick march.<br> Left, right, left, right.<br> If I wasn't so tired, I'd give them a cheer.<br> And that's no error.<br> Ready to slip, No.1?<br> All ready, sir.<br> Let go aft.<br> Hold on to your spring, for'ard.<br> Slow ahead, Starboard Pilot.<br> You'd never think there was a war on.<br> But there isn't. Not just for a minute, that is.<br> We've got five more whole days.<br> Flat calm.<br> Looks like a piece of grey silk.<br> My auntie had a dress that colour,<br> and she sent it to the cleaner's<br> and it come back all spotty.<br> Funny to think this is such a little island,<br> isn't it?<br> Mm.<br> He's got France now,<br> and France is only 20 miles from England.<br> Makes you think, don't it?<br> Mummy, Trafalgar won't eat sausage roll.<br> That's because you spoil him so dreadfully.<br> Look, Bobby. That one diving is a Hurricane.<br> No, it isn't, Dad. It's an ME 109,<br> like the one they brought down last Tuesday.<br> Don't speak with your mouth full.<br> What a perfectly lovely day it's been.<br> Lovely for us, I mean.<br> - I suppose that's very selfish of me, isn't it?<br> - Extremely.<br> I can't believe it's so dreadfully wrong<br> to forget the war now and again...<br> when one can, just for a little.<br> I think it's very clever of you, with all hell<br> breaking loose over our defenceless heads.<br> I made the most tremendous effort<br> and pretended it wasn't real at all.<br> They were toys having a mock battle<br> just to keep us amused.<br> That's the most shameful confession.<br> Sheer escapism.<br> I don't care.<br> It has been a lovely day.<br> The sun's been shining and the country<br> looks so green and sweet and peaceful.<br> And you are on leave,<br> even if it's only till the day after tomorrow.<br> Teddy, I wonder where we shall all be<br> this time next year.<br> A lot might happen between now<br> and this time next year.<br> (Guard's whistle)<br> Take care of yourself, my darling.<br> It was a good honeymoon while it lasted.<br> Tweedledee smiled gently and began again.<br> The sun was shining on the sea,<br> shining with all his might.<br> He did his very best to make<br> the billows smooth and bright.<br> This cocoa gets thicker and thicker every night.<br> It's warming, anyhow, sir. Lines the stomach.<br> Well, it's practically porridge.<br> There goes another lot, sir.<br> Looks as if poor old Plymouth's<br> going to get it again.<br> Well, I will say one thing for that bit of fish.<br> There may not have been much of it,<br> but it was tasty.<br> It's that Mr. Morgan. He always favours us.<br> It's Freda that gets round him.<br> The moment we got into the shop,<br> up he comes with a chair as if we was royalty.<br> Oh, he's all right,<br> if only he wasn't quite so nosy.<br> - How are you feeling, dear?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> Did that letter from Shorty cheer you up?<br> I wish he was home,<br> and I wish that ship would get a bit damaged,<br> not so that anyone was hurt, mind you,<br> but just so as he could get a little bit of leave.<br> Never mind, dear.<br> Men must work and women must weep.<br> That's what I always say.<br> That sink's stopped up again.<br> It never rains but it pours.<br> We'd better get Mr. Luton in.<br> He was blitzed out last week.<br> Don't know where he's moved to.<br> - Anybody seen my scissors?<br> - Yes, I've got them. Here they are.<br> (Air-raid siren)<br> Oh, here they are again!<br> Bit later than they were last night.<br> (Siren continues)<br> I wish you'd go down to the shelter, Freda.<br> Please don't start all that again, Auntie.<br> You know I hate being shut up down there.<br> It makes me feel sick.<br> I'd much rather stay up here, I would really.<br> But in your condition, I honestly think...<br> It's no use, Mother. Leave her alone.<br> It's all very fine you being calm and collected,<br> but I'll tell you one thing here and now,<br> my nerves won't stand much more of this.<br> You can go down to the shelter.<br> Nobody's stopping you.<br> Try as I may, I can't understand why<br> you won't shut up the house and evacuate.<br> I've told you why till I'm blue in the face.<br> (Footsteps outside)<br> When you could go away somewhere quiet,<br> it seems just plain silly to sit here and ask for it.<br> Could go away! Where, I should like to know?<br> Well, there's Dorothy for a start.<br> She's got a spare room.<br> Thank you for nothing. I've slept in it.<br> It may be a bit poky, but it's safe.<br> Once and for all, Mother, will you<br> do me a favour and shut up about this?<br> I've told you how I feel and that's that.<br> This is Walter's home, and he expects<br> to find me in it when he comes back on leave.<br> What do you suppose he'd think<br> if he turned up unexpected<br> and found the house locked up<br> and me hiding in the country?<br> He might only have a few hours.<br> That'd be a nice thing.<br> You could let him know where we were,<br> couldn't you?<br> Oh, it's "we" now, is it?<br> I thought there was a catch in it.<br> Kathleen Hardy, how can you say such a thing<br> to your own mother?<br> (Bomb whistles)<br> Well, I'm sorry,<br> but you make me tired sometimes.<br> I'm sure I'm only trying to be sensible.<br> What about the garden and Walter's bulbs<br> that he's so proud of? Who'd look after them?<br> Bulbs don't need any looking after.<br> They just come up.<br> (Bomb whistles)<br> (Explosion)<br> Come on, Freda. Under the stairs you go.<br> Your chair's all ready for you.<br> Oh, I'm all right here, Kath.<br> Just do as you're told, there's a good girl.<br> We'll leave the door open like we did before<br> so you won't feel lonely.<br> - Oh, Kath!<br> - Come on. I'll bring your sewing.<br> The light's quite good in the hall.<br> (Rumbling)<br> (Explosion)<br> That sounds like a land mine.<br> No, just an ordinary HE.<br> Land mines make more of a rumble.<br> (Rumbling)<br> I don't like it, Kathleen.<br> It's no use pretending I do.<br> I know you don't, Mother. Nobody does.<br> But there's no use in making a fuss, is there?<br> Cheer up, there's a dear.<br> Are you all right, Freda?<br> Yes, thanks.<br> If you're cold, I can run up<br> and get you an eiderdown<br> I'm quite warm.<br> We'll have some tea in a minute, anyway,<br> just to keep us going.<br> (Bombs whistling)<br> (Explosion)<br> Right you are. Back.<br> Carefully, now.<br> Whoa. Back. Slow.<br> Whoa. Whoa.<br> (Explosion)<br> (Explosion)<br> Tell Walter...<br> Tell him I didn't want to leave the house.<br> (Footsteps)<br> Nurse?<br> Nurse!<br> Is it all over?<br> Yes, dear.<br> It's all over. Don't worry.<br> Mother and child doing well.<br> (Air-raid siren)<br> This is the fourth time in three months<br> we've put into this dead-and-alive hole.<br> Don't worry, cock. We'll be off again tonight.<br> I know. There's no need to rub it in.<br> But I'm chock-a-block with this place.<br> Well, where could you go<br> if you could get ashore?<br> Look at it. Nowt but sheep and seagulls.<br> Not even a tree.<br> What do you expect in the north of Scotland?<br> A blinkin' casino?<br> There must be one bottle of beer in Scotland.<br> Just one wonderful bottle of beer.<br> Well, here comes Posty, anyway.<br> Edgecombe, Blake...<br> There you are, Shorty. Hollett.<br> Stick it on the table, will you?<br> My hands are wet.<br> - I expect it's a bill from my tailor.<br> - Mackeridge.<br> - Only one?<br> - That's right.<br> It's from my young sister.<br> After months on the North ruddy Sea,<br> all I get is a letter from my young sister.<br> Shut up grumbling for a bit, can't you?<br> Cheer up. It may be bad news.<br> - Oh, dear, more trouble.<br> - What's up?<br> Some fathead left the coal hole open.<br> My old woman fell down it.<br> (Laughter)<br> Joey! Joey!<br> It's come. The baby's come.<br> It weighs 7lb and it's a boy.<br> Here, listen to what she says.<br> "It was born in the middle of a blitz..."<br> What's the matter?<br> Kath Hardy.<br> Kath and her mother.<br> - The whole house went and they got killed.<br> - Mrs. Hardy?<br> Yes. My missus was living with them,<br> you know.<br> I wonder if anybody's told him.<br> They hadn't got any kids, had they?<br> No, they ain't got no kids.<br> Well...<br> I suppose I'd better go and see if I can find him.<br> Hello, Shorty.<br> I er... just popped along<br> to see if you had any news from home.<br> Not so much as a postcard,<br> but that's Kath all over.<br> All the years we've been married,<br> I've never known her get a post right yet.<br> Have you heard from Freda?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How's she doing?<br> She's all right.<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> It's Kath, Walter.<br> She and Mrs. Lemmon.<br> You see...<br> They was all in the house together and...<br> it got blitzed.<br> What do you mean?<br> Kath got killed.<br> Both of them did.<br> Freda was all right. She...<br> She was under the stairs.<br> Oh, I see.<br> So, er...<br> I thought I'd better come along and tell you,<br> seeing that...<br> Thanks, son. I'm much obliged.<br> I'm much obliged.<br> I think I'll just go out on deck for a bit.<br> Righto.<br> - I'm glad Freda's all right.<br> - Yes, she's fine. We er...<br> We've got a son.<br> I'm glad.<br> Congratulations.<br> (Seagulls cry)<br> She's going, sir.<br> Three cheers for the ship.<br> Hip, hip, hooray!<br> Hi hi hooray!<br> (Aircraft approaches)<br> Look out. They're coming again.<br> Dark object floating off starboard bow, sir.<br> Looks like a raft.<br> You're right, Yeoman.<br> Stand by to pick up survivors.<br> Aye aye, sir.<br> (Coughing and spluttering)<br> Keep up your spirits.<br> I believe they've arrived at last.<br> (All shout)<br> Looks like one of the old flotilla.<br> (Cheering)<br> (Joey plays Roll Out The Barrel)<br> # We'll have a barrel of fun<br> # Roll out the barrel<br> # We've got the blues on the run<br> (Cheering)<br> (Ship's siren)<br> Thank you.<br> - I'm damned glad to see you, sir.<br> - Thanks, No.1.<br> Captain sends his compliments, sir.<br> Thank you. Tell him from me, I warned him.<br> He won't get command of this flotilla yet.<br> It was an extraordinary bit of luck finding you.<br> The Chief Yeoman spotted you.<br> We were about to give up.<br> - How many of my men have you picked up?<br> - 90, sir. Some are badly knocked about.<br> - Where are they?<br> - Between decks.<br> - The dive-bombing's been pretty incessant.<br> (Alarm)<br> Here we go again. Anybody got any Flit?<br> - Anybody happen to know where we're going?<br> - Alexandria, I expect.<br> Join the Navy and see the world.<br> Looks to me as if it's going to be the next world.<br> It's all right. Don't move.<br> (Dive bomber approaches)<br> - Glad you're OK, sir.<br> - Thanks, Fisher.<br> We were getting a bit worried about you, sir.<br> - Nothing like a good swim before breakfast.<br> - That's right, sir.<br> Snotty, give me a piece of paper and a pencil.<br> It's... No.17.<br> Just as you turn out of...<br> turn out of the high street.<br> All right. I've got the address straight.<br> I'll let her know.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> All right, son.<br> Try it a little louder, son. I can't quite hear.<br> All right. Don't worry.<br> I'll write and tell them they can be proud of you.<br> (Bomb whistles)<br> (Explosion)<br> Of all the persistent bastards!<br> You'd think they'd get tired, wouldn't you?<br> I'll tell you something -<br> strictly between you and I -<br> I'm scared stiff,<br> and it's no good pretending I'm not.<br> If I could be at a gun, I shouldn't mind,<br> but this sitting about and asking for it<br> is beginning to get me down.<br> - Brace up. Remember Nelson.<br> - Yeah, look what happened to him.<br> (Bomb whistles down)<br> (Barrel organ plays<br> If You Were The Only Girl In The World)<br> (Doorbell)<br> (Sobbing)<br> (Doorbell)<br> Oh, all right!<br> - Name of Blake?<br> - Yes, name of Blake.<br> - Here you are, then.<br> - Thanks.<br> There's no answer.<br> (Sobs)<br> Freda! Dad! Freda! May!<br> He's safe! He's all right! He's safe!<br> He's safe, Freda! He's safe!<br> He's all right! He's safe!<br> - What is it? It's not...<br> - It's from him.<br> He's sent a telegram. It's from him himself.<br> He's all right. My boy's all right.<br> But the ship went down.<br> It said so in the papers.<br> Ook<br> OK... love.<br> There, there, dear.<br> There isn't nothing to cry about no more.<br> Shall I wait for an answer?<br> Oh... Just a minute, I'll see.<br> Can we go down to the village after tea,<br> Mummy?<br> - I want to go on my bicycle.<br> - I want to go on mine, too.<br> - You can't. You've got a flat tyre.<br> - But I'm going to pump it up again.<br> The girl's waiting for an answer, ma'am.<br> There's no answer.<br> Tell Mrs. Bates and John it's from the Captain<br> and everything's all right.<br> - I'm so glad, ma'am.<br> - Thank you, Emily.<br> Darlings, it's from Daddy.<br> He was picked up and taken to Alexandria.<br> He's quite safe.<br> Oh, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!<br> Ship's company...'shun!<br> Ship's company present, sir.<br> Thank you, Torps. Stand them easy, please.<br> Ship's company, stand at ease!<br> Stand easy.<br> Come a little closer.<br> I have come to say goodbye<br> to the few of you who are left.<br> We've had so many talks, and this is our last.<br> I've always tried to crack a joke or two before,<br> and you've all been friendly<br> and laughed at them.<br> But today, I'm afraid I've run out of jokes,<br> and I don't suppose any of us<br> feels much like laughing.<br> The Torrin has been in one scrap after another,<br> but even when we had men killed, the majority<br> survived and brought the old ship back.<br> Now she lies in 1500 fathoms...<br> ...and with her, more than half our shipmates.<br> If they had to die, what a grand way to go.<br> For now they lie all together<br> with the ship we loved,<br> and they're in very good company.<br> We've lost her, but they're still with her.<br> There may be less than half the Torrin left,<br> but I feel that we'll all take up the battle<br> with even stronger heart.<br> Each of us knows<br> twice as much about fighting,<br> and each of us<br> has twice as good a reason to fight.<br> You will all be sent to replace men<br> who have been killed in other ships.<br> And the next time you're in action,<br> remember the Torrin.<br> I should like to add...<br> ...that there isn't one of you that I wouldn't be<br> proud and honoured to serve with again.<br> Goodbye.<br> Good luck.<br> And thank you all from the bottom of my heart.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> Goodbye, Rawlings.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Best of luck, sir.<br> - Thanks, Harris. Goodbye.<br> - Best of luck, sir.<br> - Thanks. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Good luck, sir.<br> - Thanks. Goodbye.<br> - Best of luck, sir.<br> - Thank you.
