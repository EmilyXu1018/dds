She shouldn't be.<br> I wish you hadn't put up<br> that monstrosity.<br> - We'll have to take it apart later.<br> - The swing?<br> The swing.<br> Come on, Ruth!

Looks like<br> a young couple lives here.<br> Well, he needs his head<br> in school, not in her.<br> So to speak.<br> It would help<br> if you were on my side.<br> I can be on your side.<br> I've got a needle!<br> - I've got a needle!<br> - You don't need those.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Adamson?<br> You can put your shirt back on now.<br> Yesterday he was up and around<br> all afternoon...<br> but today he tumbled.<br> He's fallen twice, I have all<br> I can do to get him up.<br> He's weak.<br> Said when he couldn't work no more,<br> he didn't want to live.<br> So, for awhile he sat<br> and just mended our nets...<br> but he can't do that no more.<br> - How's you dad, Matt?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.<br> Now, Elwyn, you remember. Jesse<br> Fowler passed away a while ago.<br> We were at his funeral, remember?<br> Back in an hour, Janelle.<br> I forgot my lunch.<br> Starting to become a habit.<br> You just missed him, Matt!<br> He went home for lunch today.<br> Right. I forgot,<br> he's got an interview.<br> Frank?<br> Hello?<br> Frank?<br> Yeah, Dad.<br> What are you doing here? I thought<br> you were in Boston for an interview.<br> No. It was rescheduled.<br> Hi, Dr. Fowler.<br> Oh, hi.<br> Where are the boys?<br> They're with my mom.<br> Do you like coleslaw?<br> Have some more.<br> You sure?<br> We gotta...<br> Come on, son!<br> - There, I see him right there!<br> - Hands up, chin up.<br> - Mom, I want to play!<br> - All right, all right.<br> - Mom, there's Frank!<br> - Here's your hat.<br> Wave, you guys.<br> - Mom, hurry up, I'm late!<br> - I'm hurrying.<br> - Mom, I want to play.<br> - All right, you'll play too.<br> But first watch...<br> Frank, did you tell your mom<br> how good it was?<br> How good what was?<br> Frank had quite a time<br> this afternoon.<br> Loved you coleslaw.<br> Ate enough for two.<br> Well, that's what it's for.<br> - Hot dogs?<br> - Yeah, I'll take one.<br> So, how are the kids?<br> Things okay?<br> Yeah, they're fine.<br> Good. That's good.<br> How was your interview?<br> - It was great.<br> - Good.<br> Jason? Jason!<br> Here!<br> - She's such a brave girl.<br> - That's it. You're driving me nuts.<br> I've had lots of girlfriends and...<br> I don't understand why<br> this one's any different.<br> I know you don't.<br> We're not serious, Ma.<br> No?<br> No.<br> It's a summer thing.<br> I see.<br> - How'd did you get in this time?<br> - Chimney.<br> Thank you.<br> What can I help you with?<br> I was just dropping that off<br> for Jason.<br> What?<br> That.<br> I didn't know where<br> he'd want to put it.<br> It's about time he got it.<br> What am I gonna do with it?<br> It's really gonna mean a lot to him.<br> He's really been improving lately.<br> Yeah, so I heard.<br> It would have been nice<br> if you'd come to his game.<br> Well, I just got your message.<br> Where are they? With him?<br> That's none of your business.<br> They're my boys,<br> but they're none of my business.<br> You know what I mean.<br> I was thinking about moving back.<br> Here. With you and the boys.<br> What are you talking about?<br> What am I talking about?<br> About moving back, that's what.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> It's different now.<br> How's the job? Your father take<br> you back on at the cannery?<br> That's funny.<br> Still getting checks, aren't you?<br> Do I have to call<br> my father's accountant?<br> Did you see my new rig out there?<br> It's really nice.<br> It's not exactly new.<br> I traded David the truck for it.<br> Got room for all of us.<br> Good grocery-getting car.<br> You wanna take a ride?<br> Richard, you don't change.<br> You don't change, do you?<br> Change? No.<br> No, I don't change.<br> Everything around me changes.<br> You change.<br> You take my house...<br> and you take my kids...<br> and you fuck this other guy.<br> But me, I don't change at all.<br> - It's not your house.<br> - Oh, really?<br> No. And as far fucking goes...<br> who answered the phone<br> the other morning?<br> - She...<br> - Doesn't matter! It's not working!<br> Nat, I just want a chance.<br> For what? So you can pretend to be<br> a real father for a few days, and...<br> I am their real father!<br> I am their father.<br> No, Richard. You know what defines<br> a father? It's what he does.<br> Not what he promises.<br> It's being a positive,<br> consistent presence.<br> A positive, consistent presence.<br> What does that mean?<br> I just don't get it.<br> But I'm not fucking<br> a college boy, am I?<br> Look, you...<br> Can you just go now? I don't want<br> you here when they get back.<br> You wouldn't want that?<br> No, you have to leave now.<br> Fine.<br> - I'll see you later, Richard.<br> - Goodbye, Nat.<br> I've ignored our difference in age,<br> but you play with those blocks.<br> I'm gonna start to worry.<br> You're not looking at the house.<br> Look.<br> It's not all mine, it's part Mack.<br> What Mack was trying to achieve<br> was a common area in the center.<br> Large open spaces<br> aren't unique to Mack...<br> but the idea of<br> separating the family...<br> so that the parents were on one side<br> and the kids are on the other side.<br> So they all spill into the center.<br> It's brilliant. It's...<br> I'm boring you, aren't I?<br> I was just thinking.<br> About what?<br> About you.<br> School.<br> What if I wait a year?<br> Frank!<br> - A year won't make a difference.<br> - You can't do that, Frank.<br> Why not?<br> I've thought a lot about this.<br> I have, and...<br> No. You...<br> You told me it takes forever<br> just to establish yourself.<br> Exactly.<br> So what's a year in forever?<br> That's twisted logic.<br> Do you know what Duncan<br> said to me today?<br> You wouldn't be changing<br> the subject, would you?<br> He said, "Frank, I don't think<br> Jason really understands girls".<br> - Oh, he didn't.<br> - He did.<br> Understands girls.<br> What did you say?<br> I just didn't know<br> what to say to that.<br> I said, "Give him time, Duncan,<br> he'll come around".<br> If this is how he is now,<br> then we're in trouble.<br> What is this? Action Man?<br> Richard gave it to Dunc<br> for his birthday.<br> Very good.<br> Okay, it's 7:30.<br> We should stop now.<br> Now remember,<br> when you sing these words...<br> the way we feel about<br> the harbor is the way...<br> the Balkans felt<br> about the River Sava.<br> And listen to your tapes.<br> "Moilih Ta" is still very rough<br> and we've got a 40-minute...<br> program to have ready<br> by Labor Day.<br> Labor Day.<br> - And Anna?<br> - Yeah, Mrs. Fowler?<br> Next time, duck.<br> Great.<br> Dad.<br> Is it acid?<br> What are you putting in there?<br> - My God, what happened?<br> - Frank, hold still.<br> - Dad.<br> - This was her husband, wasn't it?<br> Ex. He dropped in.<br> You gonna press charges?<br> What's to stop him<br> from doing it again?<br> Did you hit him at all?<br> Tell me you hit him.<br> - Just so he doesn't do it again.<br> - I don't think I touched him.<br> - Jesus! Dad. dad.<br> - So what are you gonna do?<br> - Take karate.<br> - That is not the problem.<br> - Mom, you know you like her.<br> - I like a lot of people, Frank.<br> What about the boys?<br> Did they see it?<br> No, they were asleep.<br> Did you leave her alone with him?<br> He left first.<br> She was yelling at him...<br> I believe she had<br> a skillet in her hand.<br> For God's sakes.<br> Did you call the police?<br> - Not yet.<br> - You didn't call them?<br> Well, I just got in. When did I have<br> the chance to call the police?<br> - Where's the phone?<br> - No, Mom. Don't call them!<br> They'll come over<br> and scare the kids.<br> - You gotta call them.<br> - It was a scuffle, wasn't serious.<br> - Like the relation isn't serious.<br> - Ruth, now is not the time.<br> When is the time?<br> After he knocks him into a coma?<br> - This is stopping now.<br> - Oh, really?<br> Come fall, you're on a plane.<br> Are you taking them with you?<br> What are the boys gonna think<br> when you just disappear?<br> Easy, Mom.<br> Frank, this is not some sweetie from<br> Vassar you can visit on holidays.<br> You're not in this alone.<br> And the sooner you end it,<br> the better.<br> - What are we gonna do?<br> - I don't know.<br> Well, you gotta talk to him, Matt.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe he's right<br> about scaring the kids.<br> Why don't we just sleep on it,<br> deal with it tomorrow?<br> Are you gonna call the police<br> or do I have to?<br> I just told you what I think.<br> If you want to call them, call them.<br> It's not the first time<br> she's played around, you know.<br> - She's not with the guy anymore.<br> - No, I mean from before.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You've heard the same things.<br> You seem to forget. I don't take my<br> lunches in the teachers' lounge.<br> Maybe he still loves her.<br> Best part of the cod.<br> The outsiders, they won't touch it.<br> The summer fishermen.<br> They're part-timers like Frank here.<br> Get in your hair.<br> As many as 80% of them<br> now with licenses.<br> Should put up a sign: "Stay in your<br> own back yard, or lose your traps".<br> Henry is just sore because I catch<br> about twice as much as he does...<br> with an old second-hand Boudreau.<br> Now don't you listen to him, son.<br> That boat is fine. She was my first.<br> I kind of miss her sometimes.<br> And that truck you're driving.<br> When you heading<br> back to school, Frank?<br> Hello, Dr. Fowler.<br> - How you doing, Jason?<br> - Good.<br> What'd you pull?<br> Not too bad. About 40 pounds.<br> I haven't caught sight of you<br> in days.<br> - You know where to find me.<br> - When are you coming home?<br> Has it come to this?<br> Come to what?<br> You having to run errands for Mom.<br> I'm thinking of building<br> a couple hundred more traps.<br> See if I can do better<br> than break even.<br> It'll take you more then 2 years<br> to get an off-season license.<br> Unless Henry takes me<br> on as his stern man.<br> - You think he'd do that?<br> - Maybe.<br> It's as good a life as any.<br> It was good enough for your father.<br> And sometimes things<br> just skip a generation.<br> You don't think...?<br> You don't think you might<br> need something more?<br> Why? So I can have an Ivy League<br> education like you, and...?<br> If it's so great, why do you<br> sneak out every day to come here?<br> I like spending time with my son.<br> I don't know, Dad.<br> It's just... I don't know.<br> She's a wonderful girl.<br> And that's what I see.<br> Frank! How long will<br> you be parked here?<br> I'd like to unload.<br> - Give me a hand?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> You can't hypnotize<br> the cards into changing, Matt.<br> Christ! Bet, or Carl'll start.<br> "The beggar's dog<br> and the widow's cat...<br> Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.<br> The gnat sings his summer's song,<br> poison gets from slander's tongue.<br> The poison of the snake and newt<br> is the sweat of envy's foot.<br> The poison of the honey bee<br> is the artist's jealousy. "<br> All right, Carl. Two bucks.<br> I tell you, man, you gotta<br> get out of this Blake thing.<br> - You're in a rut.<br> - Don't get him started.<br> Whenever I do my own stuff,<br> you guys bitch and moan.<br> - That's not true.<br> - We love your stuff. It's great.<br> - Carl?<br> - I'm in.<br> Everybody in? Frankie, you in?<br> Guess I'm the winner.<br> Always the quiet ones.<br> Deal.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Don't mind me.<br> Your father's snoring.<br> Eat. You must be hungry.<br> I'm not hungry.<br> Coffee?<br> So you talked to her?<br> And? How is she?<br> She's great.<br> Frank, I just want<br> to tell you that we...<br> That I liked her.<br> Do like her.<br> She's a wonderful girl.<br> Ma, you're not gonna have<br> this conversation with me...<br> right now, are you?<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Okay.<br> All right. No, that's fine, sir,<br> I'll send right away.<br> Okay. I'm very excited. I'm...<br> It's a beautiful campus<br> and I'm preparing already.<br> Yes, Thank you, thank you, sir.<br> Yes, well, compared<br> to your models...<br> It doesn't compare<br> to your models, but...<br> I am. I'm aware<br> of the Lautner house.<br> Yeah. Excuse me, sir,<br> can you hold on one second?<br> Jase?<br> Jase, what is it?<br> Okay, Jason, stay put.<br> I'll be right there. Stay put.<br> He just... he just pushed me.<br> - He didn't hit me.<br> - He didn't hit you?<br> Great. We should throw a party<br> for him. He didn't hit you.<br> - We're calling the police.<br> - No, wait, wait!<br> - We're calling the police.<br> - No, I don't...<br> I don't know what I want to do.<br> I hate this.<br> I hate the kids seeing this.<br> - I don't know what to do!<br> - Listen.<br> It's okay, it's okay.<br> I'm here now. I'm here now.<br> It's all right.<br> I'm not going anywhere.<br> Okay.<br> It's all right.<br> Mom!<br> - Go upstairs with the kids.<br> - No. Frank...<br> I'm not letting him in the house!<br> Go upstairs!<br> It's better if he doesn't see you.<br> Go upstairs!<br> Don't let him in. Don't let him in.<br> - Go.<br> - Frank, don't let him in.<br> Open the door!<br> Frank?<br> Frank, buddy. You in there?<br> Sorry about what happened.<br> All right?<br> I apologize. I'm sorry about<br> what happened. Now open the door.<br> - Richard, leave.<br> - Open up.<br> - Leave now! I'm not letting you in.<br> - Open the door!<br> She left! And I'm calling<br> the police if you don't leave.<br> Just go.<br> All right. All right.<br> Get out, motherfucker!<br> Read him a story,<br> I'll be right back.<br> - I don't want to stay here!<br> - You have to.<br> You have to stay here! Look at me!<br> You're staying here, okay?<br> Read him a story.<br> Where is she?<br> You're fucking lying!<br> Where is she? Natalie!<br> Put that away!<br> Put that away!<br> Mommy!<br> There's a Mrs. Strout on line two.<br> She says it's very important.<br> Natalie?<br> Great.<br> "Your fear of death is but the<br> trembling of the shepherd...<br> when he stands before the king...<br> whose hand is to be laid<br> upon him in honor.<br> Is the shepherd not joyful<br> beneath his trembling...<br> that he should wear<br> the mark of the king?<br> Yet is he not more mindful<br> of his trembling?<br> For what is it to die<br> but to stand naked in the wind...<br> and to melt into the sun?<br> And what is it to cease breathing...<br> but to free the breath<br> from its restless tides...<br> that it may rise and expand<br> and see God unencumbered?<br> Only when you drink from the river<br> of silence shall you indeed sing.<br> And when you have reached<br> the mountaintop...<br> then you shall begin to climb.<br> And when the earth shall<br> claim your limbs...<br> then shall you truly dance. "<br> Can I get you anything?<br> - Where's Ruth?<br> - She went to lie down, Matt.<br> Excuse me.<br> My next guest is a very talented man<br> who'll perform live this month...<br> at the Montreal Comedy Festival,<br> "Just For Laughs".<br> Please welcome Anthony Clark!<br> Some more?<br> - How we doing?<br> - So nice! Waw!<br> - They're good people.<br> - They're all-yare.<br> Some of them were packing,<br> but we've cleared that up.<br> - That's good.<br> - So, what's been on?<br> Actually I've been out with Ricky<br> Martin "Living the Vida Loca".<br> When you hang out with Ricky<br> people speak Spanish to you...<br> and I think that's cool after three<br> years of Spanish in high school...<br> Matt, I'm gonna go to lunch.<br> Can I get you anything?<br> No, I'm fine.<br> Are you sure?<br> Yeah, I'm okay.<br> Okay.<br> Don't worry. I didn't make them.<br> - I wanted cheese.<br> - What? Oh! That's mine.<br> Sorry.<br> You got back to work so quick.<br> It's no too soon?<br> I can't stay home.<br> - So, how's business?<br> - You know. Same old crap.<br> Got held up again. You know that.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - Yeah. They got 75 bucks.<br> Were you on the till?<br> They'd have gotten something else<br> if I'd been on the till.<br> So how you doing? You don't<br> write or call. Where'd the love go?<br> Nag, nag, nag.<br> They set the bail hearing yet?<br> - Sometime in the next few days.<br> - Are you going?<br> I don't know.<br> Davis says it's a formality,<br> really.<br> I haven't talked with Ruth about<br> whether or not we ought to go.<br> If it's too much for Ruth,<br> I'll come with you.<br> Thanks. It'll be all right.<br> Davis says it's a formality.<br> The criminal trial set yet?<br> - October.<br> - October?<br> - That's what they tell me.<br> - Christ, they take their time.<br> - He's in there now.<br> - They're keeping him busy, I'm sure.<br> You know where they'll move him<br> once he's sentenced?<br> You got any tabasco?<br> Anita! Tabasco!<br> Shit!<br> Next weekend we really want<br> you to come up to the camp.<br> Katie's insisting. Not to pressure<br> you, but if you don't come...<br> she'll invite her sister<br> and that idiot, and...<br> I'll wind up insulting him again.<br> The future of my family<br> is in your hands.<br> Let me ask Ruth.<br> - How was your day?<br> - Fine.<br> I had lunch with Willis.<br> - It was really great to see him.<br> - My day was fine too, thanks.<br> Sorry, did you say something?<br> Katie and Willis invited us<br> up to the camp for the weekend.<br> I said I'd check with you, in case<br> we were doing something else.<br> That sounds fine.<br> We don't have to go.<br> You don't want to?<br> Yeah, I want to.<br> Then tell them yes.<br> I thought you might be<br> busy getting the girls ready.<br> Al right. The next matter is the<br> state of Maine vs. Richard Strout.<br> The record should reflect<br> the defendant was...<br> incarcerated in Knox County<br> Jail without bail since...<br> the 17th of July.<br> We're here for a bail hearing.<br> Mr. Davis, given the fact we have<br> a very crowded trial calendar...<br> I suggest we do both bail hearing<br> and probable cause hearing today...<br> at 2:OO. So unless I hear<br> any objection on the contrary...<br> I'd like to set it for 2:OO...<br> and we will take testimony<br> of your witness at that time.<br> I...<br> I closed the door.<br> I walked through my room.<br> I heard some yelling.<br> I heard yelling. Heard yelling.<br> I got to the stairs...<br> and then I heard...<br> I heard the shot.<br> - And Richard...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Richard...<br> - Could we go back just a minute?<br> Mrs. Strout, you said<br> you heard the shot.<br> You heard the shot? Did you<br> actually witness the accident?<br> Objection. There are no grounds<br> to indicate this was an accident.<br> Sustained. Strike the word<br> "accident" from the record.<br> Rephrase your sentence, Ms. Keyes.<br> Mrs. Strout, in the police<br> report you stated...<br> that you had witnessed<br> the firearm discharge.<br> Did you witness<br> the firearm discharge?<br> I thought you said there'd be<br> a jury trial sometime in October.<br> If he was incarcerated...<br> the judge would have set<br> an October court date...<br> to save the county the cost<br> of housing him as an inmate.<br> But with bail, unfortunately,<br> the court date is always later.<br> You mean there's nothing<br> we can do about this?<br> You let him walk out,<br> and we're supposed to sit here?<br> We can't appeal bail.<br> It's just not set up that way.<br> The state's bail code is to ensure<br> future court appearances.<br> In this case, Strout's family put up<br> a great amount of property as bail.<br> That, along with his ties<br> to the community...<br> made it hard to convince the judge<br> there was a risk of flight.<br> Now, you can file a civil suit.<br> I recommend it.<br> But not now.<br> After the criminal trial.<br> And when will that be?<br> Well, honestly, could be<br> anywhere from 12 to 18 months.<br> My God.<br> You're confident you can put him<br> away for good then, right?<br> The things she said in there.<br> What's the damage?<br> The way this is going,<br> potentially... manslaughter.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> He killed our son!<br> - He... It was no accident!<br> - Ruth, Ruth.<br> How long will he be sent away for?<br> That's hard to say.<br> Anywhere from 5 to 15 years.<br> But we're confident<br> we'll get the maximum.<br> - So even with good behavior...<br> -5, 10 years? Are you crazy?<br> Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler,<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I understand.<br> - No, you don't.<br> No, you don't.<br> - Doctor, what were you expecting?<br> - I have no idea.<br> Dr. Fowler, how do you feel<br> about Strout's bail?<br> Dr. Fowler, have you had<br> contact with Mr. Strout?<br> How's Mrs. Fowler handling this?<br> - Dr. Fowler!<br> - Please! No more questions.<br> Can you believe this?<br> I ask those idiots to leave<br> and no one budges, not one.<br> What are we supposed to do,<br> make them sandwiches?<br> - What are you asking for?<br> - What?<br> If you want them to leave,<br> tell them to leave.<br> - Okay, I'll tell them to leave.<br> - Good.<br> They never come up<br> to the standard.<br> And so they're always<br> disappointed. Always.<br> They're never doing enough<br> or working hard enough...<br> they never behaved right enough,<br> were never a good enough father...<br> or husband. And not only can<br> they not please themselves...<br> sad to say, nobody else<br> can please them either.<br> - You slept late. For you.<br> - Yeah, I took one of your pills.<br> You never do that.<br> Well, there it is<br> in black and white.<br> You should read some of the<br> things he says. It's unbelievable.<br> I'd better be going.<br> Where? It's Saturday.<br> There's some stuff I have<br> to catch up on at the office.<br> I won't be long.<br> Do you want your receipt?<br> Natalie?<br> I hope I'm not disturbing you.<br> Not at all.<br> Could you break a 50, please?<br> Excuse me.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> Could I possibly have another bag?<br> Sure.<br> Yeah, well, I was just...<br> Just wondering how you're doing.<br> I tried to reach you.<br> We're at my mom's house now.<br> - I wanted to call you.<br> - No, that's... It's okay.<br> Dr. Fowler, I...<br> Yeah, I know.<br> I didn't lie.<br> I didn't lie the first time.<br> It was...<br> It's how it came out.<br> Mrs. Fowler?<br> Can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds?<br> How are the boys?<br> They all right?<br> I gotta go.<br> I'll see you.<br> So how much of this is yours?<br> You ask me that every time.<br> You know the cove<br> on the other side of the cabin?<br> All the way to the other shoreline.<br> Almost 350 acres.<br> Know what it went for<br> when I bought it?<br> You don't want to know.<br> Oh, and that's little Charles<br> down at the pool.<br> He figured out how to get down<br> to the pool on the elevator...<br> by himself.<br> You must have been very proud.<br> That's Shannon waiting in line for,<br> Oh, my God, that roller coaster.<br> - You know that one? My God.<br> - Were the lines very long?<br> Sometimes.<br> Unless, of course,<br> you got the... Fast Pass.<br> What's the Fast Pass?<br> Well, you know, you got all<br> these different kingdoms there.<br> So you take this Fast Pass.<br> It's kind of a laminated card.<br> You put into a machine, and<br> it tells you when to come back so...<br> so, you know, you don't have to wait<br> in line. You just go right in and...<br> You guys ever go to Florida?<br> How many grand children<br> do you have now?<br> Well, all right, there's little<br> Charles and Shannon...<br> the three older ones,<br> and the babies...<br> That's eleven.<br> It must be wonderful.<br> Willis always says, "I guess<br> there's no danger of us dying off".<br> I'm so sorry, Ruth.<br> I just wasn't thinking.<br> I wanted to have more.<br> But we had Frank, and...<br> Matt was just starting<br> his practice.<br> So I guess it made sense.<br> Little Charles.<br> Only half acord of oak<br> left at home...<br> and you know how much<br> that Daniels charges.<br> At least I can stack this up<br> to the cabin...<br> have something to burn this fall.<br> It's a wonderful product and<br> they treat you pretty good.<br> Because of selling Mary Kay<br> we got the new Subaru.<br> The ride up was very comfortable.<br> It's a nice car.<br> It's not really a car, it's got<br> - What the hell is all that SUV crap?<br> - Sports Utility Vehicle.<br> It's a little jeep. SUV!<br> And ATV, and KFC...<br> - What's with all these, these...?<br> - Acronyms.<br> I guess it's just too much trouble<br> to say what something is anymore.<br> - What does PMS stand for?<br> - All right, I was an army brat.<br> I grew up with jeeps.<br> Willy's uncomfortable...<br> that I know more about one<br> masculine thing than he does.<br> Only one?<br> - Thanks, buddy.<br> - I like this guy.<br> You've done a nice job<br> up here, Katie.<br> Don't tell me you made<br> these curtains.<br> - Is that antique linen?<br> - Well, sort of.<br> They're pillowcases<br> from our first house.<br> I've saved every knickknack<br> and whim-wham we've ever had.<br> You included.<br> My timing is off.<br> Of course, he don't like working<br> in recruitment anymore.<br> Them boys come<br> to the office in the mall.<br> They get half-processed, and<br> they opt for that "delayed entry".<br> - I couldn't do it.<br> - Or they decide not to join up.<br> Like that one kid there. He had<br> him all the way through the works.<br> Christ.<br> The boy's folks called.<br> Called David and said<br> the boy was...<br> He wanted out so bad that he...<br> he'd taken his own life.<br> Something like that gets to you.<br> Christ, I couldn't do it.<br> I'm going now.<br> Are you looking forward<br> to going back?<br> You look nice.<br> That was very good.<br> I goofed up a little bit, but...<br> Ruth?<br> It comes in waves...<br> and then nothing.<br> Like a rest in music.<br> No sound, but so loud.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I feel so angry!<br> Louise McVey...<br> Lost a child a few years back.<br> Maybe you remember.<br> She had four.<br> It was the youngest, wasn't it?<br> She told me about<br> a vision she had...<br> when she found out<br> her daughter had died.<br> She saw herself at a great<br> distance from the Earth...<br> and encircling it,<br> an endless line.<br> As she got closer...<br> she saw that it was made up<br> of mothers traveling forward.<br> She felt into line and<br> began walking with them.<br> When they reached a certain point<br> the line divided...<br> and she said she knew...<br> that all the millions of women<br> on her side...<br> were the mothers<br> who had lost children.<br> She seemed to find<br> great comfort in that.<br> How did the little girl die?<br> A drowning, some kind<br> of swimming accident.<br> The name of the game<br> is Texas Chase' Em.<br> - Oh, jeez.<br> - Is there a problem?<br> Why delude yourself with that crap?<br> - What?<br> - We're not in Vegas.<br> It's 5-a-card draw or 7-card stud.<br> That's what I said.<br> - Carl?<br> - Asshole.<br> I'll bet a buck.<br> Raise a buck.<br> Say something, for Christ sake.<br> Quit pussyfooting around me.<br> You want me to stare<br> at these cards all night?<br> "There are things of which<br> I may not speak.<br> There are dreams that cannot die.<br> There are thoughts that made<br> the strong heart weak...<br> and bring a pallor<br> into the cheek...<br> and a mist before the eye...<br> and the words of that fatal song...<br> come over me like a chill:<br> 'A boy's will...<br> is the wind's will...<br> and the thoughts of youth...<br> are long, long thoughts'."<br> Okay, you got the two.<br> - I'm in there.<br> - I'll take one.<br> Okay. I'm gonna need...<br> I need them all. Three.<br> - Make them good.<br> - They're good, all right.<br> You know where we're going?<br> It's a surprise.<br> Matt?<br> No. I'm sorry,<br> that's totally unacceptable.<br> Yeah, so what did he say?<br> No, we can't allow that.<br> - Hold on.<br> - Excuse me. Ryan Collit's out there.<br> - His mother just brought him in.<br> - I'll call you later, okay?<br> I'll be back at 4, Janelle.<br> Sorry, Dr. Fowler, but you<br> just missed him. Thank you.<br> I really need to see him.<br> He go to lunch?<br> That's right.<br> He's across the street.<br> Thank you.<br> Matt.<br> - Have a seat.<br> - Thank you.<br> - My assistant, Jack.<br> - Hi, Jack.<br> Don.<br> This is Ed.<br> Matt Fowler.<br> So how's everything going?<br> It's okay, you know...<br> I just wanted to go over<br> a couple of things, and...<br> - When you've had your lunch.<br> - Sure.<br> We're doing everything we can,<br> Matt. I promise.<br> - What can I do, Bill?<br> - There's nothing, really.<br> Look, it can't be manslaughter.<br> There's got to be something.<br> Can't you find something?<br> Like some piece of evidence?<br> Doesn't that happen?<br> We're doing everything we can.<br> But I'm not going to lie to you.<br> All we've got is Strout, and<br> he claims there was a struggle.<br> Forensics can't determine that<br> cause of the condition of the house.<br> The best thing for you<br> to do is just sit tight.<br> Now, we haven't thrown in the towel<br> yet, and you shouldn't either.<br> We have two investigators<br> working on this case.<br> It's still a priority case for us.<br> We've got leads<br> we're following up on...<br> we've got a lot of things to do<br> before we wrap this up...<br> and we're doing the best we can<br> with the resources that we have.<br> You've gotta hang in there with us.<br> You have to have some confidence.<br> He nails these bats<br> above this scale...<br> because Bigmouth's gonna come<br> in with his catch, you know?<br> An old-timer says, "Ivan,<br> what the hell are you doing?"<br> The old man says, "Sending a<br> message", and he walks out.<br> I walk in, there's these damn<br> baseball bats up on the wall, right?<br> With a big note written right<br> across the front of them!<br> What'd it say?<br> "Here's the bats,<br> if you got the balls. "<br> He never messed<br> with our traps again.<br> Hey, Dr. Fowler.<br> Hi, Tim.<br> Did he ever...<br> Did he ever talk to you<br> about what happened that day?<br> I don't even see Richard anymore.<br> And he'd never tell me anything<br> anyway. Believe me.<br> Sure, sure. Of course not.<br> I was just wondering if...<br> maybe you heard something<br> through the grapevine.<br> Maybe one of his buddies<br> said something?<br> I was thinking. His brothers<br> still work with you, right?<br> They must talk.<br> What I'm saying is,<br> if we could find something...<br> just something concrete.<br> I could be just<br> a slip of the tongue.<br> I'll keep my ears open.<br> Thank you.<br> It's funny running into you.<br> Here, Dr. Fowler.<br> You know, well...<br> I was hoping we could talk.<br> I...<br> I wanted to tell you<br> how truly sorry I am...<br> and...<br> if there's anything<br> that I can ever...<br> do to...<br> talk with you...<br> I better get back to the grind.<br> Don't steal anything.<br> Hello, Mrs. Fowler.<br> - Anything else?<br> - A pack of Marlboro Lights.<br> Sure.<br> Now, that will be $14,95<br> with the cigarettes.<br> Thank you.<br> How did it go today?<br> - Something wrong?<br> - Wrong?<br> What could be wrong, Matt?<br> - What do you want?<br> - I want to know what's going on.<br> Right.<br> You're obviously upset. Is there<br> something we can talk about?<br> Talk? Who, us?<br> What if somebody walked in?<br> They wouldn't recognize us. They'd<br> think they were in the wrong house.<br> - Do you want to talk or not?<br> - You mean about our dead son?<br> We haven't before.<br> Why should we bother now?<br> What can I do, Ruth?<br> Forget it, Matt.<br> Why don't you just go?<br> What do you want from me?<br> I want you to stop acting<br> like nothing's happened.<br> That's what I want.<br> - Because I'm not hitting the walls?<br> - That would require feelings.<br> We don't want you<br> to hurt yourself.<br> Do me a favor. You want a grieving<br> contest, go find someone else.<br> I know how you grieve.<br> Go have another beer.<br> What the hell is that<br> supposed to mean?<br> What do you know?<br> You know nothing.<br> You don't know what I go through.<br> No, I don't know what you go through<br> or if you go through anything!<br> But that's your choice,<br> dear, not mine.<br> You're right. My choice is<br> not to scream at the world.<br> Maybe one of us<br> has to be reasonable here.<br> Reasonable?<br> Gee, Matt...<br> I don't know about you,<br> but I miss my son.<br> I'm glad you have time for reason.<br> That's what you imparted to Frank,<br> that sense and reason.<br> He thought you were<br> very reasonable.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Nothing.<br> Are you saying that I...<br> that I'm the one responsible?<br> Is that it? Well...<br> Let me tell you something. Let me<br> tell you: you got it backwards!<br> I know what you think,<br> that I was too lenient!<br> - That I let him get away with...<br> - Everything!<br> Everything!<br> - And why didn't he come to you?<br> - He wouldn't listen to me!<br> - No, he wouldn't!<br> - He didn't trust me.<br> - Because you never listened to him.<br> - No, but you did.<br> You were winking at him the<br> whole time. You encouraged him.<br> You wanted what he had. Her.<br> - My God, you've gotta be kidding!<br> - You know it!<br> You wanted it and you couldn't get<br> it. That's why you didn't stop him.<br> So you could get your kicks<br> through your son.<br> You can't admit the truth<br> to me or to yourself...<br> that Frank died for your<br> fantasy piece of ass!<br> You want to know why our son<br> is dead? You really want to know?<br> He was with her not because of me.<br> He went there because of you.<br> Yes, he did.<br> Because you are so controlling...<br> so overbearing...<br> so angry that he was it!<br> That he was our only one.<br> - That is not true!<br> - Yes, it is. Yes, it is.<br> Even when he was a kid, you were<br> telling him how he was always wrong.<br> I remember. One time you yanked<br> him out of a Little League game...<br> and sent him home...<br> for throwing his glove<br> in the dirt.<br> He was what? 9 years old!<br> Everything he did was wrong.<br> Well, what was wrong<br> with him, Ruth?<br> You're... you're so unforgiving.<br> You are. That's what he said.<br> And you're pulling<br> the same shit with me.<br> And that's a horrible way to be.<br> It's horrible.<br> You're bitter, Ruth.<br> Point your finger at me<br> all you like...<br> but take a damn good look<br> at yourself.<br> I just wanted to talk about<br> what happened, Matt.<br> You want me to be open with you,<br> embrace you?<br> You scare me.<br> How can I talk to you?<br> Sometimes I...<br> Sometimes I can't even look at you.<br> God.<br> That's probably the police.<br> Hi. I'm Kristen Gellar from the<br> Rockland Gymnastics Association.<br> We're selling brand-name candy.<br> Each purchase is matched<br> by the Tandy Corporation...<br> to help us meet our goal<br> of traveling to Oahu...<br> to compete in the<br> East/West conference.<br> Okay, I'll take some.<br> Oh, and today we have a special.<br> Six bars for ten dollars.<br> Okay, I'll do that.<br> - Should I hold something?<br> - Could you hold this? Thank you.<br> - Okay, there's the ten.<br> - Thank you.<br> Here.<br> You can pick anything you want.<br> Any six?<br> Ruth...<br> what I said just now...<br> I...<br> I had no right.<br> No one...<br> No one should ever have<br> to hear stuff like that.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> You're right, Matt.<br> I am horrible.<br> Please, please, please don't.<br> I don't blame you.<br> It's just...<br> That girl came by the school...<br> and I couldn't forgive her.<br> I was...<br> I was so...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I've been so...<br> I've been so angry.<br> That's okay.<br> It's just...<br> I've seen him. I keep seeing him.<br> I know. I...<br> I know. In his room, you know,<br> sometimes I can swear he's there.<br> And today, at a stoplight...<br> ...I could've sworn Frank...<br> - Not Frank.<br> Richard.<br> And I don't know what to do.<br> Ruth?<br> Where did you see him?<br> Everywhere, Downtown,<br> at the market. I saw him...<br> I saw him at South End.<br> He smiled at me, Matt.<br> I keep running into him.<br> He smiled.<br> It's okay, it's okay.<br> - Honey, you coming to bed now?<br> - Soon. Matt's still here.<br> Oh, well... Well, hi, Matt.<br> Honey, when you come to bed,<br> would you bring me my pills?<br> They're on the top shelf<br> from where the kids were here.<br> - All right.<br> - Thanks, dear.<br> I never thought about bail.<br> I thought I wouldn't have<br> to worry about him for years.<br> You know what I heard?<br> He's tending bar up to<br> Old Orchard Beach for a friend.<br> You notice even the worst<br> bastards have a friend?<br> Nobody knows him there...<br> If they do, they don't care.<br> They drink what he mixes.<br> I hate him, Matt.<br> My boys went to school with him.<br> He was the same.<br> Know what he'll do?<br> Five years at the most.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Remember the woman<br> about seven years ago?<br> Shot her husband and<br> dropped him off the bridge...<br> with a 10O-pound sack of cement...<br> and said the whole way through it<br> nobody helped her.<br> - You know where she is now?<br> - Where?<br> She's up to Searsport now,<br> a secretary.<br> And whoever helped her,<br> where the hell is he?<br> It'd break my heart, Matt.<br> It would.<br> But, you ever think about just...<br> moving away?<br> Yeah, we have.<br> It wouldn't matter.<br> I'll lock up.<br> I'll walk you to your car.<br> - Good night. See you tomorrow.<br> - Wait up!<br> - Want to come over for a drink?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Come on!<br> - Maybe some other night.<br> Just one drink!<br> Come on!<br> All right.<br> Fucking bitch!<br> What are you doing here?<br> Anything I can help you with?<br> - Don't talk.<br> - God.<br> Unlock the door and get in.<br> Wait just a minute.<br> Let's calm down.<br> All right, all right.<br> All right.<br> All right, all right.<br> Unlock it.<br> Is there anyone in your place?<br> - Not tonight.<br> - Good.<br> Drive there.<br> Drive slowly.<br> - Don't try to get stopped.<br> - All right.<br> He was making it with my wife,<br> Dr. Fowler.<br> Don't talk.<br> Let's go to the back door.<br> Keep your mouth shut.<br> Turn the light on.<br> - Where's your suitcase?<br> - My suitcase?<br> - Yeah, where is it?<br> - In the bedroom closet.<br> Okay, that's where we're going.<br> When you come to a door, stop<br> and turn the light on. Let's go.<br> There's no wall switch.<br> - Where's the light?<br> - By the bed.<br> Go ahead.<br> Sit down. On the bed.<br> Which closet is it?<br> Where are the suitcases?<br> I wanted to work things out<br> with Natalie.<br> I tried to get back together again.<br> But I couldn't.<br> I couldn't talk to her.<br> He was always with her.<br> It was an accident.<br> I'm going to jail.<br> If I get out, I'll be an old man.<br> Isn't that enough?<br> You're not going to jail.<br> Pack clothes form warm weather.<br> You're going to let me go?<br> You're going to jump bail.<br> What?<br> Go ahead.<br> - Go ahead!<br> - All right, all right.<br> See, it's the trial. We can't go<br> through that, my wife and I.<br> That's why you're leaving.<br> I've got you a ticket.<br> My wife keeps seeing you.<br> I can't have that anymore.<br> Thank you, Dr. Fowler.<br> I'd go pick up my boys<br> and he'd be there.<br> Sometimes he spent the night.<br> Duncan told me.<br> - I'm sorry, Dr. Fowler.<br> - All right, that's enough.<br> I need some things<br> from the bathroom.<br> - Keep walking.<br> - I gotta pee.<br> Go ahead.<br> Wait.<br> Let's go.<br> They'll catch me. They're<br> going to check passenger lists.<br> I didn't use your name.<br> They'll figure that out. I would've<br> done it myself if it was that easy.<br> You were alone.<br> We got it worked out.<br> Who's "we"?<br> Start the engine. Let's go.<br> There's no planes this time<br> of night, Dr. Fowler.<br> Go north on 73.<br> The airport's south.<br> Someone's gonna keep you awhile.<br> They'll take you to the airport.<br> Turn the radio on.<br> Find the game.<br> - It's after 1:OO.<br> - They run it again.<br> No more talking.<br> Let's see, the last Red Sox player<br> to have a 3-home run game...<br> would've been Trot Nixon<br> last year in Detroit.<br> Norman had one previous to that...<br> off with a fastball, ball one.<br> He holds to get back at first, the<br> outfield swung around to their left.<br> And a groundball roll<br> at a stretch stop.<br> Flip to second before it starts<br> back, it's four on the fourth.<br> Actually hits to a fourth<br> play to end the inning.<br> The second the inning is over,<br> Red Sox have left 7 after 6.<br> The Red Sox 7, the Braves 2...<br> on the WEPI Red Sox Radio Network.<br> he had hit too.<br> Hits one into the air...<br> - Turn around.<br> - Why?<br> We missed it, turn around!<br> There's nothing back here,<br> Dr. Fowler.<br> I don't understand why we<br> don't just drive to the airport.<br> You don't think we'd leave<br> your car at the airport, do you?<br> I'll do 20 years, Dr. Fowler.<br> I'll be 53 years old.<br> That's a year younger<br> than I am now.<br> Where are we?<br> Almost there.<br> Turn it off. Leave the lights on.<br> - Is this your cabin, Dr. Fowler?<br> - No, it isn't. Let's get the bags.<br> - Mr. Grinnel.<br> - I'll get them, son.<br> Wait.<br> You can take this.<br> Matt!<br> What did you do?<br> This isn't what we talked about.<br> He...<br> He tried to run.<br> We were going to wait<br> and take him out in the woods.<br> I couldn't wait.<br> I better get the ATV.<br> Wait.<br> Come on, we gotta go.<br> Come on, go!<br> What time is it?<br> It's 10 to 4.<br> We lost an hour, I'm sorry.<br> Yeah. High tide.<br> Can't stop people from fishing,<br> Matt.<br> - Fucking bridge.<br> - I'm sorry, Willis.<br> Stopped into his little<br> shed there once.<br> Place reeked.<br> He's spilled more whiskey<br> than we've ever drunk.<br> We'll just pray he's already<br> three sheets to the wind.<br> Katie's pill will be<br> wearing off soon.<br> Did you do it?<br> Are you all right, Matt?<br> There was a picture of him<br> and Natalie on the wall.<br> What is it, Matt?<br> The way she was smiling.<br> What?<br> I don't know.<br> Matt...<br> What am I thinking?<br> You must be hungry.<br> Matt!<br> Matt?<br> Do you want coffee?<br> VIDEOLAR<br> KRiSTi@N.cz<br>
