Bein' she's<br> in there by her little old lonesome,<br> I'll let you have her for free.<br> I told you 'bout that "Sam" business,<br> didn't I? Hm?<br> Sorry, Mr Wood.<br> I mean, uh... Officer Wood.<br> Well, a bow-legged Polly<br> and a knocked-kneed Paul<br> A bow-legged Polly<br> and a knocked-kneed Paul<br> A bow-legged Polly<br> and a knocked-kneed Paul<br> They can't get together at all<br> Just like the worm in the cornfield<br> said to his brother<br> "Yeah, go in one ear and out the other"<br> Well, a bucktoothed Clara<br> and a cross-eyed Clyde<br> A bucktoothed Clara<br> and a cross-eyed Clyde<br> Like old bow-legged Polly<br> and a knock-kneed Paul<br> Every time I see your face<br> It's got a way of turnin' me around<br> You tune me in, pretty baby<br> Wild things begin<br> Baby, that ain't love<br> But it sure is groovy<br> It's Colbert, all right.<br> Skull's caved in.<br> You ever take a homicide<br> picture before, son?<br> Well, at least he won't be movin' on me.<br> That's for sure. I want you to cover every<br> angle. Do you hear me? Every angle.<br> Uh, you boys, move on back now, OK?<br> Came all this way to build us a factory,<br> make somethin' outta this town.<br> Look what it got him.<br> Yeah.<br> Sam, did he have a wallet,<br> identification, anything like that?<br> That's the first thing I looked for.<br> Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.<br> Nothin'.<br> - Any witnesses?<br> - I mean, not even a cat.<br> - How long's he been dead?<br> - Oh, less than an hour.<br> - Less than an hour.<br> - Maybe half that.<br> Maybe half.<br> Could have been a hitchhiker.<br> Check both ends of town, check<br> the depot, and check the pool hall. OK?<br> - Pool hall closed at one o'clock, Chief.<br> - I said check it, Sam.<br> Yes, sir.<br> On your feet, boy.<br> I mean now!<br> Get against that wall.<br> Get them hands high!<br> Spread them fingers out.<br> I wanna count all ten.<br> You move before I tell you to, boy,<br> by God, I'm gonna clean your plough.<br> That's pretty fat there, ain't it, boy? Huh?<br> Now, outside there's a police car.<br> You're gonna pick up that bag.<br> You're gonna walk out, and you're<br> gonna plant yourself in the back.<br> And you're gonna be<br> a real nice quiet boy all the way in.<br> You hear?!<br> C'mon, boy.<br> Move it!<br> Chief here?<br> - Hey, what's up, Sam?<br> - Chief?<br> What's goin' on?<br> Sam?<br> - Wood?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> When's the last time I asked Courtney<br> to get oil for this damn thing?<br> Uh, last Wednesday.<br> Would you be kind enough to go outside<br> and remind him what day it is today?<br> Well, uh... how about the prisoner here?<br> Don't you worry about him.<br> Got a name, boy?<br> Virgil Tibbs.<br> Virgil?<br> Well, I don't think we're gonna<br> have any trouble, are we, Virgil?<br> No trouble at all.<br> Oh, you can go now, Sam.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - What did you hit him with?<br> - Hit whom?<br> "Whom"? Whom?<br> You a Northern boy? What's a Northern<br> boy like you doin' all the way down here?<br> - I was waiting for the train.<br> - There ain't no trains this time of mornin'.<br> - Tuesdays only. 4.05 to Memphis.<br> - You say.<br> Well... All right, you say right.<br> All right... Virgil.<br> Oh!<br> Now look.<br> I try to run a nice, clean, safe town here.<br> A town where a man can sneeze and not<br> get his brains beat out. You follow me?<br> Yes.<br> Why don't you tell me how you killed<br> Mr Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.<br> Not now!<br> I was visiting my mother.<br> I came in on the 12.35 from Brownsville.<br> I was waiting to go out on the 4.05.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Yeah.<br> And meanwhile, you killed yourself<br> a white man and picked yourself up $200!<br> I earned that money,<br> ten hours a day, seven days a week.<br> Coloured can't earn that. It's more than I<br> make in a month! Where did you earn it?!<br> - Philadelphia.<br> - Mississippi?<br> - Pennsylvania.<br> - Just how do you earn that kinda money?<br> I'm a police officer.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - Wood!<br> - Yes, sir!<br> - Did you question this man?<br> - No, sir.<br> Would you mind taking a look at that?<br> Yeah! Oh, yeah!<br> I'll check on this wise city boy.<br> You take him outside and hold him.<br> Yes, sir.<br> May I suggest that you call my chief<br> rather than send a wire or anything?<br> I mean, it would be quicker.<br> And I'll pay for the call.<br> Did you hear? Did you hear him<br> say he'd pay for the call?<br> How much do they pay you<br> to do their police work?<br> $162.39 per week.<br> $162.39 a week!<br> Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.<br> But treat him easy,<br> because a man that<br> makes $162.39 a week -<br> man, we do not wanna ruffle him!<br> No, sir!<br> Courtney... would you try<br> and get me long-distance?<br> Police business, honey.<br> Chief's on the line.<br> No. He catch you listenin' in,<br> he'll run your butt around the block.<br> - He don't panic me none.<br> - No?<br> - Where's the chief?<br> - You got the pictures of the dead man?<br> Sure do. I got him top,<br> bottom, sideways - you name it.<br> - Good. I'll take 'em, son.<br> - No, I wanna give 'em to the chief.<br> - I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.<br> - Do like he tells you, Charlie.<br> Somebody owes me<br> some money for those.<br> I had to buy paper and film<br> and developin'.<br> That's all right. Just bill the department.<br> Everything will be taken care of.<br> God Almighty. He sure looks bad.<br> May I see the man<br> I am supposed to have killed?<br> Sure. I don't know why not.<br> Hey, Sam. He's finished talkin'.<br> - Here's the photos of the dead man.<br> - OK.<br> Got your chief on the phone.<br> He wants to talk to you.<br> Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry<br> to have gotten you involved in this.<br> I really had no choice.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even<br> if I could be of help, they wouldn't want it.<br> No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.<br> Yes, sir. I am a police officer<br> and they're police officers, but...<br> Hello. This is Gillespie.<br> Yes, sir. Yep, well...<br> You don't say?<br> He's your number one homicide expert?<br> Well, my, my, my.<br> I don't think we need any help.<br> We can wrap this up ourselves.<br> Yes, sir. But I do want to thank you<br> for offering me such a powerful piece<br> of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.<br> Yes, sir. Thank you.<br> Yeah. Goodbye, now.<br> Oh, it's all there.<br> We paid for the phone call ourselves.<br> Now, you are the number one<br> homicide expert.<br> - That's right.<br> - I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.<br> Lots.<br> Well?<br> - Well, what?<br> - Well...<br> I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you<br> wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?<br> No, thanks.<br> - Why not, expert?<br> - Because I've got a train to catch.<br> Wait a minute.<br> That train don't leave till noon.<br> They pay you $162.39 a week just to look<br> at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?<br> - Why can't you look at it for yourself?<br> - Because I'm not an expert...<br> Officer!<br> Ten cents, ten million dollars - just<br> doesn't matter when a man's time comes.<br> Mm-hm.<br> I could give him a nicer service<br> right here in Sparta<br> than he could ever get up there<br> in Chicago. And at half the price, too.<br> I got a rosewood casket out there...<br> Ted Ulam, Chief.<br> We haven't had the pleasure.<br> That's for sure.<br> He's with me.<br> Hello, Doc.<br> Yep.<br> Well...<br> Uh...<br> Do you wanna look at it?<br> New manicure. That's good.<br> That's very good.<br> - I'll need a few things.<br> - Such as?<br> Ammonium hydrosulphide,<br> benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.<br> Copper powder, distilled water.<br> A six-inch celluloid scale.<br> Thermometer.<br> Some tweezers.<br> Callipers. And some toothpicks.<br> Toothpicks?! Copper...?<br> What's goin' on here, Chief?<br> Who is this boy anyway?<br> I asked him to look at the body.<br> That's who he is.<br> It's 4.45. What time was this man killed?<br> Sam found him at 3am. The doctor says<br> it's possible he was killed an hour earlier.<br> - At two?<br> - Maybe a little later.<br> 2.15... 2.30?<br> Would you feel the face and jaw, please?<br> Am I mistaken, or has rigor begun?<br> It has.<br> You'll notice too<br> that postmortem lividity is present.<br> So the time of death really has<br> to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?<br> Mm.<br> Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that<br> as soon as I get a thermometer.<br> As you know, the loss of heat from<br> the brain is the most reliable way<br> of determining time of death.<br> Right, Chief?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Well...<br> Which one of you gentlemen<br> will assist me?<br> Ulam's Funer... It's for you, Chief.<br> Yeah. Talk to me.<br> When?<br> Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've<br> got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.<br> Now listen, you. Anything he wants,<br> man, you better see that he gets it.<br> Where can I wash my hands?<br> This here's Shagbag, you hear?<br> He's headed for the river.<br> The river, you hear?<br> He's gonna be in Arkansas.<br> Shoot.<br> OK. I got him.<br> Mrs Colbert.<br> - How is she taking it?<br> - Chief had to leave. She don't know it yet.<br> Hey! You can't go in there, boy!<br> - Mrs Colbert?<br> - Where's my husband?<br> What's happened to him? Why won't<br> anybody tell me what's happened to him?<br> Why won't anybody here tell me?<br> I have a right to know if he's hurt,<br> if he's been in an accident.<br> I want to know if he is all right!<br> Your husband is dead, Mrs Colbert.<br> Uh...<br> Somebody killed him.<br> We don't know who - yet.<br> It's, uh...<br> It's very hot in here.<br> It's very hot in this room.<br> Sit down.<br> No.<br> Would you...<br> Would you... leave me alone<br> for a few minutes, please?<br> Virgil, we don't need you or your<br> microscopes. Tell that to your chief.<br> We don't need him - or you.<br> Mrs Colbert's in there.<br> - I've already told her.<br> - I see.<br> Here is the examination results from<br> Ulam's. You wanna know what I found?<br> No. I don't need to look at 'em now.<br> May I examine this prisoner?<br> Yeah, you can look at him.<br> C'mon, let him look. Go on.<br> All right, now! Steady!<br> You finished?<br> Thank you.<br> All right, Fryer, bring him with me.<br> - Now we're grindin' corn!<br> - You shoulda been there!<br> If it weren't for them radios,<br> we woulda lost him goin' over that bridge.<br> That old boy highballing that train<br> like to cut us off.<br> And old Charlie's hound dog got loose...<br> - Did he confess?<br> - Huh?<br> The man you arrested, did he confess?<br> Well, I believe he will.<br> Yes siree, I believe he will.<br> I believe he will.<br> - He's left-handed, isn't he?<br> - How do I know?<br> Well, he seemed left-handed to me.<br> I believe Harvey is a southpaw.<br> Now, ain't he, Shagbag?<br> What if he is? What's that make him?<br> Innocent.<br> Mrs Colbert... There's just one more thing.<br> Yeah.<br> I picked it up, I tell you. He was already<br> lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!<br> I just picked it up, ma'am. That's all I did.<br> Shut up.<br> - Get him outta here.<br> - OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.<br> Mrs Colbert, I, uh... I wonder if you'd mind<br> if I have somebody drive you over<br> so you could, uh...<br> complete the identification?<br> Martin, I want you to take<br> Mrs Colbert over to the funeral parlour.<br> And, Wood, run Virgil down the depot.<br> Uh... Virge here, Chief,<br> he thinks that Harvey's innocent.<br> - Well, I'll be damned.<br> - Could I talk to you about it, in private?<br> No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my<br> hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.<br> - You think he gave it to him?<br> - I don't know.<br> But Oberst could have come along<br> after the crime, found it, picked it up.<br> - I don't know.<br> - That's what the boy said he did.<br> Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I say different.<br> When I examined the deceased,<br> it was obvious the fatal blow was struck<br> from an angle of<br> 17 degrees from the right,<br> which makes it almost certain<br> the person who did it is right-handed.<br> - So what?<br> - Harve's left-handed, Chief.<br> - Everybody in town knows that.<br> - We figured that out.<br> Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.<br> You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny<br> name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.<br> - What do they call you up there?<br> - They call me Mr Tibbs!<br> Mr Tibbs! Well, Mr Wood, take Mr Tibbs,<br> take him down to the depot.<br> And I mean, boy, like now!<br> I'll have the FBI lab<br> send you the report on this.<br> Not that it'll make any difference.<br> I'll take that.<br> No, you won't.<br> I'm sending it in personally.<br> My God!<br> What kind of people are you?<br> What kind of a place is this?<br> My husband is dead.<br> Somebody in this town killed him!<br> I want you to find out who!<br> You gonna give me that?<br> No, I'm not.<br> Wood, you take him,<br> and you lock him up<br> for withholding evidence.<br> Go on, move! Put him with<br> his friend, Harvey Oberst!<br> Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains<br> to the hogs, that's for damn sure.<br> Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.<br> We got another customer.<br> Hey, man, not in here.<br> - Put him somewheres else!<br> - Don't push the panic button.<br> Play it cool, boy. Play it cool.<br> Hey!<br> Hey!<br> What you doin'<br> wearin' white man's clothes?<br> Where d'you come from?<br> You deaf or somethin'?<br> Listen, I'm get...<br> Keep cool, Harvey.<br> I'm on your side.<br> Well, I don't need you!<br> I'm all you've got.<br> Police?<br> You're a cop?<br> - You're a cop.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Yeah?<br> So, how come they locked you up?<br> How come they lock up a cop?<br> Who said they locked me up?<br> How come with all these empty cells here<br> they'd throw me in with you? You dig?<br> Look.<br> I already told 'em.<br> I see this fella lyin' on the street there.<br> And there's this wallet lyin' beside him.<br> Boy, I mean, I come into<br> this worid outta luck.<br> Here's the first good thing<br> to come my way. And I pick it up.<br> But when I see whose wallet it is...<br> I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard<br> about this new chief. This Gillepsbie?<br> Got no more smile than a turnip.<br> So I cut across the fields, headin' for the<br> line, and got myself as far as the bridge<br> before Gillepsbie grabbed me.<br> What time did you find the wallet?<br> Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have<br> been after two, by the courthouse clock.<br> I'm interested in eleven to two.<br> Where were you?<br> Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.<br> I got there about ten.<br> - What time'd you leave?<br> - Closin'. Must have been one.<br> - Anybody can swear for you?<br> - Packy, Bert, Les.<br> Ever been in trouble<br> with the police before?<br> Come on.<br> I could ask at the desk, you know.<br> Well, they brought me in one time.<br> - On account of this Delores Purdy.<br> - On what charge?<br> Well, uh, this Delores, she, uh...<br> she's real proud of what nature<br> done for her, you know?<br> And, uh...<br> Well, we was on a date<br> up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...<br> she says, uh...<br> Anyway, she asks me, she says, uh...<br> "Don't you think I got a classy build?"<br> And I say "Sure."<br> And so she starts to show me.<br> But I didn't do nothin' wrong.<br> I just didn't stop her from<br> tryin' to prove her point.<br> Then this cop, Sam Wood,<br> comes chargin' outta the bush<br> and hauls me in.<br> He let you go, didn't he?<br> Told me not to mess with her no more.<br> She lives on Third, a block from me.<br> Traipsin' around in the altogether.<br> With the lights on.<br> Now, somebody sure oughta<br> make her stop doin' that.<br> Come here.<br> Let me see your right hand.<br> - What you doin'?<br> - Hold still.<br> All right now, give him<br> the waiver for false arrest.<br> Forget it.<br> I'm askin' you to sign it. Please.<br> Give him a pen. Give him a pen.<br> All right. Let him out.<br> You'll be able to catch the 12.10 train.<br> It wouldn't be a bad idea<br> to change the charge against Oberst.<br> He was nowhere near the scene<br> of the crime, and I think he can prove it.<br> - I bet you know when Colbert was killed.<br> - About 12.30.<br> - While Harvey was still shooting pool.<br> - Wait a minute. I'll get it.<br> There's cue chalk under his nails,<br> not dried blood.<br> - Thank God I don't live in Philadelphia.<br> - One more thing.<br> Colbert wasn't killed<br> where the body was found.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He was killed then moved to Main Street.<br> - Courtney?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Change the charge to theft.<br> D'you mean Harve?<br> Who the hell else do we have back there?!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hey.<br> Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?<br> No, not me, sir. Must have been<br> my brother Harold. He's on days.<br> Harold.<br> Police department.<br> Yes, he's here. Hold on, sir.<br> Mayor's on the line, Chief.<br> What's all this Miz Colbert's been<br> tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?<br> No, ma'am. We ain't had no cover-up.<br> In fact, we just dropped the charges<br> for insufficient evidence.<br> Miz Colbert, I told you<br> he was nobody's man.<br> I came by to make it<br> as clear as I possibly can<br> that I do not want that Negro officer<br> taken off this case.<br> Negro officer?<br> Yeah, well, he, uh...<br> He comes from up North, you see.<br> And he was, uh, kinda...<br> - passin' through...<br> - If it wasn't for him,<br> your impartial chief of police would still<br> have the wrong man behind bars.<br> I want that officer given a free hand.<br> Otherwise, I will pack up<br> my husband's engineers...<br> and leave you...<br> to yourselves.<br> Miz Colbert, now don't you<br> worry about a thing.<br> Believe me, we're gonna<br> take care of everything.<br> Bill?<br> I wanna see you come through<br> this now, you hear?<br> Even if we have to<br> step on Endicott's toes?<br> Even that.<br> But do it fast.<br> All right.<br> Now, Bill, how about<br> this here Negro officer?<br> Miz Colbert seems<br> to have confidence in him.<br> Oh, he ain't nothin'. Some kind of a...<br> some kind of a homicide expert.<br> But I don't need him.<br> You mean you don't want him.<br> But you do need him.<br> Now look, Bill.<br> Suppose he turns up the killer.<br> He has no police power here. He's gonna<br> have to hand him over on a platter, right?<br> That's right.<br> And if he fails, you're off the hook, cos it<br> was Miz Colbert's idea in the first place.<br> See what I mean?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Works out all the way around, Bill.<br> For all of us.<br> Excuse me.<br> Any reason why you have to leave today?<br> There's lots of reasons.<br> What would you say if<br> I asked you to stay for a while?<br> No.<br> This town needs a factory, Virgil.<br> Colbert come down<br> from Chicago to build it.<br> I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.<br> Half of them'd be coloured.<br> - Know what that means?<br> - Probably got him killed.<br> That's what Mrs Colbert thinks.<br> She wants us to catch her a killer.<br> No killer, no factory.<br> Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta<br> coloured people. You follow me?<br> - I'm going home, man.<br> - They're your people.<br> Not mine - yours. You made this scene.<br> - What do you want me to do? Beg you?<br> - Look, I've had your town up to here!<br> Boy, it would give me a worid<br> of satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!<br> My father used to say that.<br> - Even did, once or twice.<br> - Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.<br> Now you listen to me.<br> Just once in my life<br> I'm gonna hold my temper.<br> I'm tellin' you that you're gonna stay.<br> You'll stay here if I have to have your<br> chief remind you what he told you to do.<br> But I don't think<br> I have to do that, you see?<br> No. Because you're so damned smart.<br> You're smarter than any white man.<br> You're just gonna stay here<br> and show us all.<br> You could never live with yourself<br> unless you could put us all to shame.<br> You wanna know something, Virgil?<br> I don't think that you could let<br> an opportunity like that pass by.<br> Jess?<br> Jess, this is, uh...<br> This is Virgil. He's workin' for me.<br> Give him somethin' that runs. Fix him up.<br> What I fix, runs. Who pays?<br> Police.<br> Well, you know where to find me.<br> What you doin' here, man?<br> Policeman.<br> You're a policeman here in Sparta?<br> They've got a murder<br> they don't know what to do with.<br> They need a whipping boy.<br> You got a roof?<br> No. I'll find a motel.<br> Viola... We got company.<br> Know what's gonna happen?<br> He gonna get hisself killed.<br> You watch and see he don't.<br> I'm aware of the risk, Tom.<br> But, like it or not, we're stuck with him.<br> Not if the chief here is right on the ball.<br> What do you say, Chief? You got that old<br> killer all lined up in your front sights, hm?<br> I'm workin' on it.<br> Tom, climb off of Gillespie's back now.<br> You know damn well we didn't<br> hire him off a homicide squad.<br> Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week.<br> Cos Colbert's only the start.<br> I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.<br> Mrs Colbert, can you tell me<br> about your husband's enemies?<br> That's Endicott.<br> He's been fighting us all the way.<br> He sits up on his hill<br> and runs this county.<br> Or did, until we moved in.<br> Did your husband tell you<br> where he was going last night?<br> He said he wasn't sleepy. I went to bed.<br> What time was that?<br> A little after 11, I think.<br> Did he call you, or anybody<br> on your staff, after 11?<br> No.<br> Maybe the elevator boy<br> can tell us what time he went out.<br> They put it on self-service after ten.<br> Did your husband use a car here?<br> Find anything?<br> - Whoever killed Colbert drove this car.<br> - How do you know?<br> Where you goin'?<br> I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you don't<br> want me running up there by myself.<br> - Up where?<br> - Eric Endicott's.<br> Endicott's?! Come on, now!<br> None of that for you, huh, Virgil?<br> In the heat of the night<br> Mm-hm, ain't a woman yet been born<br> Yeah<br> Knows how to make the mornin' come<br> It's so hard to keep control<br> Yes, it is<br> When I could sell my soul<br> For just a little light<br> In the heat of the night<br> Listen. You know<br> something I don't know?<br> I found a piece of osmunda<br> in Colbert's car.<br> - A piece of what?<br> - On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.<br> Fern root? Oh, is Mr Endicott here?<br> Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.<br> Would you follow me, please?<br> - Gillespie.<br> - Mr Endicott.<br> This here's Virgil.<br> - Mr Tibbs.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> Oh, may I have Henry fetch you<br> somethin'? Some light refreshment?<br> - No, thank you. We're all right...<br> - I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.<br> Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.<br> I'll have one, too.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I didn't know it was possible<br> to grow this species locally.<br> - Oh, you like flowers?<br> - I do.<br> Mr Tibbs, do you know<br> anything about orchids?<br> - Not very much, but I do like them.<br> - Well, let me show you.<br> Endicott's folly.<br> - What do you think?<br> - It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.<br> - Have you a favourite, Mr Tibbs?<br> - Well, I'm partial to any of the epiphytics.<br> Why, isn't that remarkable!<br> That of all the orchids in this place,<br> you should prefer the epiphytics.<br> I wonder if you know why.<br> Maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me.<br> Because, like the Negro,<br> they need care and feedin' and cultivatin'.<br> And that takes time.<br> That's somethin' you can't make<br> some people understand.<br> That's somethin'<br> Mr Colbert didn't realise.<br> Is this what the epiphytics root in?<br> My point! They thrive on it.<br> Take it away from them, they do poorly.<br> - What do you call this material?<br> - That's osmunda. Fern root.<br> Well, we don't wanna take<br> any more of your time, Mr Endicott.<br> Why'd you two come here?<br> To ask you about Mr Colbert.<br> Let me understand this.<br> You two came here... to question me?<br> Well, your...<br> your attitudes, Mr Endicott,<br> your points of view,<br> are a matter of record.<br> Some people - let us say<br> the people who work for Mr Colbert -<br> might reasonably regard you as the<br> person least likely to mourn his passing.<br> We were just trying<br> to clarify some of the evidence.<br> Was Mr Colbert ever in this greenhouse?<br> Say, last night, about midnight?<br> Gillespie?<br> Yeah?<br> - You saw it.<br> - Oh, I saw it.<br> What are you gonna do about it?<br> I don't know.<br> I'll remember that.<br> There was a time...<br> when I could have had you shot.<br> - You better clear out. And I mean fast!<br> - What about that speech you gave me?<br> I didn't know you'd slap any white man!<br> Least of all Endicott!<br> All right. Give me another day.<br> Two days. I'm close.<br> I can pull that fat cat down.<br> I can bring him right off this hill!<br> Oh, boy.<br> Man, you're just like the rest of us.<br> Ain't ya?<br> It's all my fault.<br> But there's no point in ducking it.<br> It's gonna be tough<br> to keep you in your job now.<br> Now look here, Bill. I don't have to tell you<br> how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.<br> - No. I already told him to go.<br> - All right.<br> Now, Miz Colbert<br> is not gonna be back till Thursday.<br> You catch your guilty party by then,<br> she won't hold it against us we had<br> to send Tibbs home for his own good.<br> But you gotta do it, you hear?<br> I hear.<br> Bill?<br> What's made you change<br> your mind about Tibbs?<br> Who says I have?<br> Last chief we had,<br> he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he<br> slapped Endicott, claimed self-defence.<br> - Gillespie here.<br> - Courtney here, sir.<br> - Did you take Virgil down the depot?<br> - No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.<br> - Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.<br> - Check.<br> Hey! C'mon! C'mon!<br> Hey! C'mon!<br> OK, black boy. We come here<br> to teach you some manners.<br> We told you about them bad manners,<br> boy. You better put that down.<br> Why don't you<br> come and get it, baby?<br> C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.<br> C'mon. Let's get him.<br> We'll put that round your neck.<br> Hit him, man! Get him from the side!<br> Get behind him!<br> All right, hold it!<br> All right, boys.<br> You've had your fun.<br> Now go on, you just run along home.<br> Nigger-Iover.<br> - I didn't catch what you said.<br> - Get rid of the nigger.<br> You don't... we will.<br> Now, is that a suggestion,<br> or is that an order?<br> That's a warnin'!<br> I see.<br> I see.<br> Shut up and take this trash outta here!<br> Come on, move it and go!<br> Well, you finally get the message, Virgil?!<br> May I get in?<br> - Thought you left town.<br> - Not yet.<br> Could you follow the same route you<br> followed Tuesday night, same speed?<br> - Why?<br> - Why not?<br> - Maybe I better check with the chief.<br> - I wouldn't want him to slap you down<br> for steppin' outta line,<br> makin' decisions on your own,<br> and all that.<br> He don't knock me outta my socks.<br> Let's get rollin', Virgil.<br> All you little birds better lock up tight<br> Cos there's a foul owl<br> on the prowl tonight<br> Hey, little lark, get outta the dark<br> Foul owl on the prowl<br> Cute little jay, stay outta his way<br> Foul owl on the prowl<br> You just might be the quail he'll tail<br> Foul owl on the prowl<br> You just might be<br> the swallow he'll follow<br> Foul owl on the prowl<br> If you hear him hoot - scoot<br> If you pass his tree - flee<br> If you catch his eye - fly<br> Don't wait to say goodbye<br> Take ten minutes to get myself<br> a king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.<br> That is, if that peckerwood<br> ain't sold out again.<br> - Can I bring you anything?<br> - No. I'm coming in.<br> I thought I told you to get outta here.<br> - I'm not ready to leave.<br> - I was gonna tell you, Chief.<br> - You forget about those four maniacs?<br> - I need more time.<br> - Do I have to put you on the train myself?!<br> - I guess so!<br> Whoa.<br> All right, Virgil.<br> Just what the hell do you want?<br> I wanna know exactly where Sam was<br> at all times on the night of the murder.<br> If you pass his tree - flee<br> If you catch his eye - fly<br> Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have one hell<br> of a mess in this town. You know that?<br> I know.<br> Got some real luscious cream pie<br> for you tonight, Sam.<br> I mean Officer Wood.<br> Just like you always order.<br> You know I don't eat that stuff. The chief<br> likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?<br> Why don't you shut up, Sam?<br> - All right, what'll you have, Virgil?<br> - I ain't servin' him!<br> Tuesday night you walked<br> out of here at 2.40. Right?<br> Right on the button.<br> Two minutes from now.<br> That's for him.<br> Now, what'd you do<br> when you came out that night?<br> Well, I picked up the radio and called in.<br> Do it, please.<br> Go ahead. Go ahead.<br> Uh... Wood to radio.<br> I'm leavin' Compton's now.<br> Sam, look sharp.<br> Gillespie's sniffin' around.<br> Gimme that thing!<br> Courtney, your brother says I didn't<br> tell him to fix that hinge, so I told you.<br> Do you read me, Courtney?<br> - Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.<br> - I'd do that if I were you.<br> Yes, sir. Ten-four.<br> All right, you can move us. Officer Wood.<br> - Why'd you do that, Sam?<br> - Do what?<br> Change your route<br> back there at the corner.<br> Who says I changed?<br> Look, I oughta know what I did!<br> Chief, do I have to put up with this?<br> Do I work for you, or do I work for him?<br> Good night, gentlemen.<br> I don't know.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Well, I appreciate anything you can do.<br> - This is highly irregular.<br> - Yeah, I know that.<br> Showing our depositors' accounts?<br> Hm. I don't know.<br> - You sure this is an official request?<br> - Yes. It's official, yes.<br> - You willing to put that in writing?<br> - Yeah. I'll put it in writing.<br> On police department letterhead?<br> I would write it on the head of a pin<br> if you want it there.<br> - I gotta have somethin' for the file.<br> - I realise that, but I'm in a hurry.<br> Well, we'll see.<br> He's had an account with us<br> for several years now.<br> That so?<br> Not a large account.<br> Never more than... Yeah.<br> $208.<br> That was back in '62. September.<br> I am not interested in '62 September.<br> I am interested in yesterday.<br> Yesterday? Well...<br> Well.<br> According to this,<br> he made a deposit of... $632.<br> - Yesterday?<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Must have been when I was out to lunch.<br> A deposit that size, I'd remember.<br> Oh, you'll send me that letter<br> for the file, you hear?<br> I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief<br> didn't like him, not even from the first.<br> - Morning.<br> - Where do you think you're goin'?<br> It's all right. Let him go.<br> I just talked to the FBI lab. We can<br> prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.<br> Endicott's covering up.<br> I'm afraid you're too late.<br> We already got the guilty man.<br> - Who?<br> - Sam.<br> - Sam?<br> - That's right.<br> Our man is Endicott.<br> You just think a minute.<br> Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?<br> And yesterday he makes<br> a big cash deposit at the bank.<br> If I told you once,<br> I told you a hundred times<br> that I won that matchin' quarters<br> and halves. It took me three years!<br> Then why was it in big bills? I checked.<br> Because whenever I got enough change,<br> I'd trade it in on $20 bills.<br> And when I got up to $600,<br> I took it down and put it in the bank.<br> The day Colbert was killed, he cashed<br> a cheque for $900, $600 of which is gone,<br> $300 of which I believe you left in the<br> wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!<br> - What kinda man do you think I am?!<br> - Now, don't you push me, boy!<br> Now listen.<br> If you weren't suspicious of Sam here,<br> why did you question him last night<br> when he changed his route?<br> - I knew why he changed his route.<br> - Knew what?<br> He was afraid I'd see<br> some naked white girl down the block.<br> - What?<br> - Some girl named Delores Purdy.<br> She parades around in the nude<br> at night to get her kicks. That's...<br> - How do you know?<br> - I know.<br> Well, I know. Do you understand?<br> I know that Colbert<br> cashed a cheque for $900.<br> I know that Sam made a big cash deposit.<br> I know that you caught him in a lie.<br> And I know that's enough for me.<br> C'mon, Sam.<br> Martin, lock him up.<br> Well?<br> Well... you're making a mistake.<br> Don't you bet against it.<br> You can catch your train now, Virgil.<br> Tibbs?<br> Do you think Sam did it?<br> - Where do I find the chief?<br> - What's it all about?<br> My business.<br> Hey, look, Purdy.<br> Now, you got a complaint?<br> Well, right here's where you file it.<br> What I got to say, I say to the chief.<br> It's about Sam Wood.<br> All right.<br> Yeah?<br> Purdy's out here, sir.<br> It's about Sam.<br> All right. Send him in.<br> She is gonna have a baby.<br> Sam Wood's baby.<br> Well, ask her yourself<br> if you don't believe me!<br> What are you doin' here?<br> It's important that I hear this.<br> I ain't talkin' about this<br> with him in the room.<br> - Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!<br> - You be sensible. I'm a police officer.<br> You gonna get him outta here,<br> or do I gotta do it?!<br> You ain't gonna do nothin'.<br> You just stand there and shut up.<br> Sit down, little girl.<br> All right, now.<br> You tell me... all about it.<br> Just tell me how it happened.<br> Oh, come on. Come on, girl, speak!<br> - Well, you know how hot it's been.<br> - Yeah.<br> Nights, they aren't any better.<br> My brother works nights.<br> He leaves me all alone.<br> This particular night,<br> I go out on the porch.<br> I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be<br> if I had a fountain drink.<br> Sam comes down our road.<br> Just like he comes every night.<br> Passin' like a lord<br> in that fine, big, shiny car.<br> Only, this time he stops.<br> He's got a nice face,<br> don't you think, Chief?<br> So he stopped.<br> - He says...<br> - What? I didn't hear what you said.<br> He says...<br> "Hey, little girl,<br> you know what<br> the coolest spot in town is?"<br> And I said "No, Sam. I guess I don't."<br> And he said...<br> "The cemetery. That's where."<br> "Know why?"<br> "Cos they got all of them<br> big, cool tombstones."<br> "Ever stretch out<br> on a tombstone, Delores?"<br> "Feel all that nice, cool marble<br> along your body?"<br> - He said that?<br> - You hear, Chief? You hear?<br> Yeah, I hear. I hear.<br> All right. Sam comes along and stops in<br> front of your house and talks. What else?<br> Well, come on now, girl.<br> What else? What else? What else?<br> - Then I went for a ride with him.<br> - Where'd you go?<br> The cemetery.<br> So, Wood took you to<br> the cemetery in the patrol car, right?<br> And then things went a bit too far.<br> Is that what you're sayin'?<br> Did they get a little bit outta line?<br> Come on now.<br> Is that what you're tryin' to say?<br> Come on, girl! Is it or ain't it?<br> - Yeah, they went too far!<br> - Well, fine!<br> Now, I got one more question.<br> Very important.<br> Did he force you, or did you let him?<br> Don't mean a damn whether<br> she let him or not! She is still 16!<br> In this state, that's rape!<br> I know the plain law on that!<br> I know the laws in the state<br> of Mississippi, thank you!<br> - Are you sure you're pregnant?<br> - Yes, I am pregnant!<br> - Courtney!<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Better get in here with a pad and a pencil.<br> Come on in. I want you<br> to take this all down.<br> You had no right to keep a nigger<br> in the room, shame my little sister.<br> You had no right.<br> Virge, what's happenin'?<br> - Hi, Harve.<br> - How are you?<br> - Fine.<br> - Man, uh...<br> - You sure saved my hide.<br> - Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...<br> If a guy knocks up a girl in this town,<br> where can he go for help?<br> - Barbershop.<br> - Barbershop?<br> Borrow Mr Fanning's razor<br> and cut your throat!<br> Well...<br> But suppose<br> Mr Fanning's razor is too dull.<br> Suppose he's got some<br> real money to spread around.<br> Uh...<br> Well, uh...<br> There used to be a coloured gal.<br> But she kept bumpin' her price,<br> and I don't know if she's still in business.<br> - What's her name?<br> - Well, I ain't never had to look her up.<br> But, uh... Packy might know.<br> Where do I find Packy?<br> Down at the pool hall.<br> But, man, he wouldn't tell you.<br> Not unless I say so.<br> And how am I gonna say so<br> locked up in here?<br> Suppose I get word to Packy that you<br> wanna see him? Have him come here?<br> Will you let him<br> bring me a cheeseburger?<br> Onions?<br> Now you're talkin'!<br> Uh... Virge?<br> A little careless, ain't you, Virgil?<br> Parked in the road, you could get yourself<br> killed. Anybody'd know where you are.<br> - You know what this land is?<br> - Yeah. It's the site for the new factory.<br> I found a piece of wood in Colbert's scalp.<br> The lab identified it as pine.<br> Three people saw Colbert drive by -<br> alone - on the way back from Endicott's.<br> Colbert must have picked up somebody<br> in town and then come out here.<br> I tell you he didn't pick up nobody.<br> Sam followed him here, come up behind<br> him, just like I come up behind you.<br> - I heard you.
