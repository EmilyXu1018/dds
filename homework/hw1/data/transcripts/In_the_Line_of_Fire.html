                        Oh, my God!<br> Frank, thank God! I'm dead.<br> I'm dead.<br> Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.<br> This town is so confusing.<br> What a day.<br> My wife had to work early.<br> My kid was crying when I took him to<br> school. He hated to leave Chicago.<br> - It broke my heart, Frank.<br> - Any more excuses?<br> - No.<br> - Good. In the future be punctual.<br> - You got it?<br> - I'm sorry. It won't happen again.<br> - Frank, how are you doing?<br> - It's good to see you again.<br> - Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late.<br> - Al, go help Jimmy and Raul.<br> Yeah, sure. This is his.<br> - You don't trust me?<br> - I live in a crappy neighbourhood.<br> - Have you got that funny money?<br> - Yeah. Right here.<br> It looks good. It looks real good.<br> - We're in business.<br> - Excellent.<br> There's just one problem.<br> This guy Al...<br> He keeps asking all these questions<br> about my counterfeiter.<br> My instinct usually tells me<br> when something's wrong.<br> And there's something wrong.<br> So I had him followed.<br> He's a Secret Service agent, Frank.<br> - What do you think I ought to do?<br> - Be sure the body doesn't wash up.<br> I want you to pop him for me, okay?<br> - I think maybe you're with him.<br> - You came to me, remember?<br> - So pop him. Show me I'm an asshole.<br> - I'm just a businessman.<br> So pop him...<br> and let's do some business.<br> Yes, that's what I'm looking for.<br> Come on, let's go get an omelette.<br> Let me get my pistol.<br> My gun?<br> You're under arrest.<br> You're under arrest, too.<br> Secret Service.<br> You knew from the weight<br> of the gun that it was empty, right?<br> There could have been<br> one bullet there.<br> Do you think we can go someplace<br> and talk about this?<br> - Doesn't killing guys get to you?<br> - It gets to you.<br> I don't like this undercover stuff.<br> I was so scared.<br> I joined the Secret Service...<br> ...to protect people.<br> You like the idea of<br> throwing yourself in front of a gun?<br> Hoping you get hit instead of<br> the guy you're protecting?<br> I don't know. Maybe I'm...<br> - Maybe I'm just wrong for the job.<br> - You're a good man, Al.<br> - You'll make a good agent.<br> - How do you know?<br> I know things about people.<br> - Come on, let's eat.<br> - I've got to go home to my family.<br> A lot of guys warned me<br> you were a pain in the ass.<br> - I'll see you in the office.<br> - Damn! The office.<br> - Monroe wants us to check this out.<br> - I'll take care of it.<br> - I'll go with you.<br> - No. Go hug your wife and kid.<br> I was not snooping,<br> but the smoke alarm was going off.<br> I got scared.<br> I got more scared<br> when I saw what was inside.<br> The smoke was from crumbs<br> in the oven he left on.<br> I love the United States.<br> I've been to the White House.<br> Only in the United States can just<br> anybody go to visit the President.<br> So when I saw this,<br> these killing things...<br> ...I called the police.<br> They called the Secret Service.<br> That was two days ago.<br> The President gets 1,400 threats<br> a year. We've got to check them all.<br> - You say his name's McCauley?<br> - No, McCrawley, from Denver.<br> I remember it like yesterday.<br> I cried and cried.<br> Joseph McCrawley, Denver.<br> Died 30 years ago, age 11.<br> Your guy is using his ID.<br> Thanks, Jack.<br> Federal Agents.

I've got<br> to pull 75 agents out of Miami.<br> Keep me posted, Sam, will you?<br> - So what do we do with this guy?<br> - We keep investigating.<br> - Tap my phone.<br> - Will he call again?<br> - He'll call. He's got panache.<br> - Panache?<br> - Yes, it means flamboyance.<br> - I know what it means.<br> - Really? I had to look it up.<br> - All right, we'll tap your phone.<br> By the way, Watts isn't nearly<br> as arrogant as you were.<br> Just what reputation was Watts<br> referring to, Sam?<br> You know.<br> Am I considered a borderline burn-out<br> with questionable social skills?<br> What do you want to talk to me<br> about, besides your reputation?<br> I want to be assigned<br> to the President.<br> Protection? After all these years?<br> Frank, you're a dinosaur.<br> - This guy's gonna make a try.<br> - Watts will fight me all the way.<br> You owe it to me.<br> - I've kept you in a job.<br> - I've got to come back.<br> Do you really want<br> to stand post again? At your age?<br> Yeah, I've got at least<br> one pair of good shoes somewhere.<br> We're stopping.<br> Traveller wants to work the ropes.<br> The French President's coming.<br> Get a security man up here.<br> Damn it! Get back.<br> - What's going on here?<br> - Horrigan had a heart attack.<br> - Hey, are you okay?<br> - Get the hell out of here.<br> - What's going on?<br> - I had a call about a cardiac case.<br> - Are you all right, Frank?<br> - I'm on my break here.<br> I get it, you bastards.<br> Who's the wise guy?<br> Okay, everybody, back to work.<br> - All right, who was the joker?<br> - It may not have been a joke.<br> - You were looking peaked today.<br> - I'll pay him back in spades.<br> How can you be sure it was a him?<br> - You've missed my street, Al.<br> - Why don't you have a car?<br> I lived in New York a long time.<br> I like public transportation.<br> If you like buses,<br> why make me go out of my way?<br> I like your company.<br> - He's a weird-looking guy.<br> - Lf he still looks like that.<br> Pull up over here.<br> The President's election troubles<br> were hardly apparent today.<br> He and the French President<br> stopped twice to greet the crowds.<br> The Senate has yet to react<br> to the new French trade agreement.<br> The French will host a formal dinner<br> at their embassy for the President.<br> Presidential advisors are pleased...<br> ...with the publicity this<br> has brought in an election year.<br> It's a weird sub-culture, Al.<br> Send some agents to check this out.<br> - Ask about some whackos.<br> - I'll get on it in the morning.<br> Hang on, I've got the other line.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Frank.<br> - Booth, how are you doing?<br> - I'm fine, thanks.<br> Hang on,<br> I'll get rid of the other call.<br> - You got it?<br> - Yeah, keep him talking.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Trying to trace me?<br> - Why didn't I think of that?<br> - You did. You're a good adversary.<br> - But I was worried about you today.<br> - Why?<br> In the motorcade, I thought<br> you were going to pass out.<br> You should get in shape<br> for that kind of duty.<br> - Yeah, maybe you're right.<br> - I'm watching your movie.<br> - Movie?<br> - November '63. Kennedy's last days.<br> The arrival in Texas.<br> It must have been ex citing.<br> Dallas. That morning at Love Field.<br> You all look so radiant.<br> JFK, Jackie and you.<br> You look so young and able, Frank.<br> What did happen to you that day?<br> The only agent to react to the shots<br> was farther away than you.<br> You must have looked up at that<br> window, but you didn't react.<br> Late at night when the demons come...<br> ...do you see the rifle at the window,<br> or Kennedy's head being blown apart?<br> If you'd reacted in time,<br> could you have saved him?<br> If you had, that could've been<br> your head being blown apart.<br> Do you wish you'd succeeded,<br> or is life too precious?<br> What's done is done.<br> I have that Esquire article<br> about you and the other agents.<br> So sad how your wife left you<br> and took your little daughter.<br> You were so forthright<br> about your drinking problem.<br> And that you weren't easy to live with.<br> I was so moved by your honesty.<br> The world can be a cruel place<br> to an honest man.<br> What about you, Booth?<br> What's your story?<br> It's an epic saga.<br> I'll talk to you again soon.<br> It's nice to have a friend.<br> - Did you get him?<br> - We got him.<br> He may have a device that makes it<br> look like he's using another number.<br> - This device, how could he get it?<br> - He could build one.<br> - Can you trace it?<br> - We could run a parity check.<br> - Can you trace the call?<br> - Not if it's a para-analog line.<br> Give me a straight answer,<br> or Al will shoot off his foot.<br> If he calls again, keep him on<br> the line. We'll see what we can do.<br> You might suggest that the police<br> don't knock down any more doors.<br> I have that Esquire article<br> about you and the other agents.<br> So sad how your wife left you<br> and took your little daughter.<br> You were so forthright<br> about your drinking problem.<br> And that you weren't easy to live with.<br> I was so moved by your honesty.<br> - Okay, but why play it for me?<br> - Cancel the President's dinner.<br> The dinner at the French Embassy?<br> This close to the election?<br> He manipulated the phone system.<br> He could have knowledge of explosives.<br> - Do your job. There'll be no problems.<br> - There may be arms in the embassy.<br> You think the French<br> want to knock off the President?<br> Why does every chief of staff...<br> You have no reason to think that<br> this is anything but an idle threat.<br> You want me to cancel a state dinner<br> and risk offending the French?<br> This guy's pushed your buttons<br> and you're overreacting a little.<br> - I'm trying to protect your boss.<br> - So am I.<br> We're trailing 12 points in the polls,<br> and the election's in six weeks.<br> - He's got to be seen.<br> - Even if it kills him?<br> How could being down 12 points<br> look like good news?<br> The President was even worse off<br> weeks ago.<br> He'll be out with the voters in<br> the Midwest and then in California.<br> The President and First Lady<br> of the United States.<br> His Ex cellency, the<br> President of France and his wife.<br> Agent Raines,<br> you look devastating tonight.<br> Good enough to eat...<br> if you'll pardon the expression.<br> I try to sympathize with you,<br> but you really do annoy me.<br> Why sympathize?<br> The tape of that phone call.<br> When he mentioned your wife.<br> - Ex-wife.<br> - At any rate, I'm sorry.<br> Strange, I get sympathy from<br> an assassin and a woman I annoy.<br> - Would you care to dance?<br> - Perhaps some other time.<br> I get off in a couple of hours.<br> - What are you looking at?<br> - Where do you hide your firearm?<br> Don't tell me, let me guess.<br> We're on our final approach to L.A.<br> It's a beautiful day out there.<br> Thanks for flying with us.<br> We hope to see you again.<br> - Deposit this in the new account.<br> - I'll need to see your papers.<br> "Microspan Corporation.

I was wondering<br> if you'd care to join me for dinner.<br> That's sweet, but...<br> I also wanted to apologize for lying<br> to you about being from Minneapolis.<br> I shouldn't ask so many questions.<br> Did you mention our conversation<br> to anyone at the bank?<br> - No!<br> - May I?<br> Rory, settle down!<br> - Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi.<br> - This is my roommate.<br> - Sally, this is Mr. Carney.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - I was just on my way out.<br> - I'm sorry, but you can't leave.<br> What?<br> You shouldn't have been<br> from Minneapolis.<br> I don't know what you want, but...<br> - Hi, this is Sally.<br> - This is Pam. We're not in right now.<br> - Leave your name and number.<br> - And we'll call you back. Bye.<br> Frank, I hope you don't mind me<br> calling you at the office.<br> - No, why don't you drop by?<br> - I'd love to.<br> Let me take some time to welcome<br> those who are joining us late.<br> I'd love to drop by.<br> We've got so much in common.<br> We do? Like what?<br> We're both willing to trade<br> our lives for the President's.<br> We were both betrayed<br> by those we trusted.<br> - I wasn't betrayed, Booth.<br> - Sure you were, Frank.<br> The Warren Commission reported your<br> procedure as seriously deficient.<br> They criticized all the agents for<br> being out drinking the night before.<br> As if Kennedy would be alive today<br> if you'd been in bed by 10 p. m.<br> - Maybe they were right.<br> - No, they weren't right.<br> You wanted to have agents stationed<br> all around his car. He refused.<br> Do you know why?<br> Because he had a death wish.<br> He talked all the time<br> about being assassinated.<br> His favourite poem was about death.<br> I think he wanted to die.<br> And I think he didn't care that<br> his death would ruin your life.<br> What do you think?<br> Frank?<br> - What about you? Who betrayed you?<br> - I don't think he's scrambling it.<br> Some of the same people,<br> but I'm going to get even.<br> I'll have my day in the sun.<br> The question is, will you?<br> I think you're in<br> for a lot more pain.<br> How much of this shit<br> do I have to listen to?<br> He's across the street.<br> LaFayette Park.<br> Booth!<br> I told you to get in shape, Frank.<br> That's him! Al, that's him!<br> Secret Service! I'm impounding<br> this car. He put his hand on here.<br> - We got fingerprints.<br> - Are you all right, Frank?<br> Hey Tony, have a look at this.<br> - The print from Secret Service?<br> - Yeah, it's really strange.<br> This is C-12. We can't tell them.<br> Horrigan, I'm afraid<br> we've drawn a blank.<br> - You're sure?<br> - We ran it against everything.<br> I'm meeting with the President.<br> You keep investigating.<br> - What should I do?<br> - You'll think of something.<br> You're a real pain<br> when things don't go your way.<br> Your friends warned you about that.<br> The President hit the campaign trail<br> today on a 6-day tour of 12 states.<br> With just a month to the election,<br> he's trailing by 10 points.<br> He'll concentrate on the Midwest,<br> where he's sagging in the polls.<br> The campaign will wind up<br> in Chicago with a big rally.<br> Reservations.<br> Do you have a flight on Tuesday<br> from Washington to L.A.?<br> I'd like an open-ended ticket so I<br> can make some stops on my return.<br> C-5, off-load the choppers first.<br> Who's our route agent?<br> That'll be Jacqueline King.<br> This is Watts,<br> we have arrival at 13.15.<br> - Where are we keeping the cars?<br> - Denver PD has an area for us.<br> This is Watts,<br> we're ten minutes out.<br> Here in Denver we gather today<br> in the shadow of giants.<br> Brave pioneers who overcame the<br> wilderness and carved a new nation.<br> Today we are asked<br> to match our vision to their vision.<br> And to pass that legacy on.<br> - Is sector three secure?<br> - Sector three is secure.<br> The President was campaigning<br> today in Denver.<br> We are living in a time<br> of global economic transition.<br> We need compassion and vision<br> to create a future...<br> ...of peace and progress<br> for everyone.<br> The President is due to arrive<br> here in L.A. Later in the month.<br> He'll compete for California's<br> This is Sandy Riggs calling.<br> If you want to catch a rally<br> in the Midwest, you'd best call me.<br> The President has no fixed schedule.<br> In answer to your other question, just<br> send a cheque to party headquarters.<br> Ladies and gentlemen of Holly, Michigan,<br> the President of the United States.<br> We've gone a long way<br> toward achieving that goal...<br> We've got some trouble up ahead.<br> Notify the White House staff.<br> Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.<br> Flight 318 to Milwaukee<br> is now boarding at gate 21.<br> All passengers<br> proceed to the boarding area now.<br> Checking.<br> Hey, pal, found any bombs today?<br> - Did the First Lady ask about me?<br> - Have you gotten to know them yet?<br> - I prefer not to get to know them.<br> - Why is that?<br> They might not be worth<br> taking a bullet for.<br> Here comes my replacement.<br> Let's go to the bar.<br> - We can't drink on the road.<br> - But they have a great piano player.<br> I've played for presidents<br> and with presidents.<br> Nixon and I once did<br> a duet of "Moonglow. "<br> - I heard he didn't like you.<br> - We got on all right.<br> His Chief of Staff didn't like me.<br> He once ordered me to get rid of<br> some anti-war protesters.<br> I said I couldn't do that.<br> Freedom of speech and such.<br> He said, "When I'm talking to you,<br> I am the President. "<br> I said, "You look like a sack of shit<br> in a cheap suit to me, sir!"<br> - The "sir" was a classy touch.<br> - I thought so.<br> You never wear shades<br> when you're standing post.<br> I like the whackos<br> to see the whites of my eyes.<br> A glare can be just as effective<br> as a gun. Know what I mean?<br> You know what I mean?<br> You got me.<br> You'd better stick to the shades,<br> sweetheart.<br> What are you afraid of?<br> I'm afraid of making a big mistake.<br> Good night.<br> Good, we've got some updates<br> on Milwaukee.<br> Thanks.<br> Don't answer it.<br> Raines.<br> Okay, I'll be right down.<br> Traveller's losing ground in<br> Georgia. Milwaukee's out tomorrow.<br> And they're staging a rally<br> somewhere outside Atlanta.<br> Damn!<br> What am I doing?<br> Oh, Lilly...<br> I've got to put all that shit<br> back on, damn it!<br> I'm glad to see you all<br> out here in the rain with me today.<br> I've been saying,<br> "Don't just vote for me, join me. "<br> And today you certainly have.<br> We may get a tad damp today.<br> But guess who's gonna be all wet<br> on Election Day?<br> - How about the watch list?<br> - 23 crazies are under surveillance.<br> The hospital?<br> Extra units of Traveller's<br> blood type are on hand.<br> Accessible to the alternate route too.<br> - Under the weather?<br> - Sick as a dog, Lilly.<br> What's this? " Psychological<br> Profile of John Booth. "<br> - Did you make a mistake?<br> - What?<br> You said you were afraid<br> of making a big mistake.<br> With this job, let's be realistic.<br> It's not like we work in a bank.<br> - You had an affair with an agent?<br> - He wasn't an agent.<br> But he left you<br> because you wouldn't quit your job?<br> I left him.<br> I wouldn't quit my job for him.<br> It broke my heart.<br> You vowed never again to let a man<br> come between you and your career.<br> But now you're in love with me and<br> it scares you a little, doesn't it?<br> - Blow your nose.<br> - Sorry.<br> What would happen<br> if I gave up my job for you?<br> Why would you do that?<br> I vowed never again to let my career<br> come between me and a woman.<br> Frank...<br> Hey, be careful, will you?<br> This whole event's been advertised<br> in advance. Just be alert.<br> Watts, it's Horrigan, it's a zoo here.<br> We gotta take Traveller underground.<br> This is Watts. We are using the<br> alternate arrival site. Underground.<br> - Watts, Booth may be here.<br> - I thought you couldn't identify him.<br> - I can't. Just call it a hunch.<br> - Ignore your psychic abilities.<br> All posts take to your positions.<br> - You've got a fever, Frank.<br> - You stay alert in there, will you?<br> One quality above all<br> marks this President.<br> It has earned him the respect<br> of the people of this country.<br> That quality is courage.<br> The question is, will we stand<br> by the man who has stood by us?<br> - Stage right?<br> - Stage right, all clear.<br> - Stage left?<br> - Stage left, clear.<br> - Stage centre?<br> - Stage centre, clear.<br> The President of the United States<br> and the First Lady!<br> - Gun!<br> - Get down!<br> What the hell's going on in there?<br> All clear.<br> - False alarm.<br> - Traveller's secure. Resume positions.<br> - Are you hurt, Mr. President?<br> - I'm all right.<br> Everything's all right, folks.<br> We had a little false alarm there.<br> That was exciting, wasn't it?<br> Take your seat, please.<br> It was just a balloon popping.<br> Traveller wants to continue.<br> Do you have any idea how many<br> votes you cost us last night?<br> The President looked like a coward.<br> He looked all right. You were<br> the one who looked like a coward.<br> - Is this just a joke to you?<br> - No, you're a joke to me.<br> - You have no idea what we do.<br> - That's enough!<br> I'll have you busting<br> counterfeiters in Alaska!<br> Keep him away from the White House<br> and away from me!<br> - The man's a disgrace.<br> - You can't talk to him like that.<br> I don't work for him.<br> You work for me. At least<br> you did. You're off my detail.<br> My Super Bowl debt. In case<br> I don't see you after this trip.<br> You know, Frank...<br> ...if you just acknowledge that<br> it was an unfortunate situation...<br> - I'm not going to apologize.<br> - I'm not saying you should.<br> - But the President was humiliated.<br> - He's alive.<br> - We are here to save his dignity too.<br> - I'm not paid for that.<br> When Kennedy's girlfriend got into<br> trouble, you said she was with you.<br> - That was just a rumour.<br> - I heard the whole story.<br> You were suspended for a month<br> in order to save his dignity.<br> - He was different.<br> - Maybe you were different.<br> I was different.<br> The whole country was different.<br> Everything would be different if I'd<br> been half as paranoid as I am today.<br> Frank...<br> Why not just retire? Live off<br> your pension. What's the point?<br> Somebody else asked me that<br> not long ago.<br> You don't spend any money,<br> except on jazz records.<br> I want to stay<br> on the Booth case, Sam.<br> All right, but as for<br> protective detail...<br> I understand.<br> That thing in Chicago...<br> I've never been on the wrong side<br> of a judgement call like that.<br> You had the flu!<br> That can impair your judgement.<br> Face it, Frank.<br> You're too old for this shit.<br> What happened<br> in the Windy City, Frank?<br> Booth?<br> - Did the balloon get you panicky?<br> - You were there.<br> I couldn't help wondering why you'd<br> risk your life to save such a man.<br> You have such a strange job. I can't<br> decide if it's heroic or absurd.<br> Why would you risk your life<br> to kill a man like that?<br> - Read my psychological profile.<br> - I don't believe in them.<br> Nor do I. A man's actions don't equal<br> the sum of his psychological parts.<br> - It doesn't work that way.<br> - Just how does it work?<br> It doesn't work. God doesn't punish<br> the wicked and reward the righteous.<br> Everyone dies.<br> Some die because they deserve to.<br> Others die because they come<br> from Minneapolis. It's meaningless.<br> If none of this means anything,<br> why kill the President?<br> - To punctuate the dreariness.<br> - You need to get yourself laid.<br> You're the same. Name one thing<br> in your life that has any meaning.<br> - I play the piano.<br> - That's not enough.<br> How do you know? Do you play?<br> I've seen you in your bar alone.<br> There's no cause worth fighting for.<br> All we have is the game.<br> - I'm on offence. You're on defence.<br> - When do we start playing the game?<br> The clock's ticking, Frank.<br> Take care.<br> He scrambled it. I missed him.<br> Fuck!<br> Jesus, Frank.<br> I called for hours.<br> I thought something happened to you.<br> I'm sick, I'm tired<br> and I'm armed, too. So be careful.<br> - You're also maybe a genius.<br> - Not to be recognized in this lifetime.<br> - Did you listen to the call?<br> - Yeah, remember...?<br> Call the field office in Minneapolis.<br> See what you can find<br> about the accidental deaths.<br> Frank!<br> Will you listen to me, please?<br> - Spit it out, damn it!<br> - We spoke to some model builders.<br> There is a professor at Pasadena<br> College. I think we've got something.<br> I met him at a design conference<br> in New Orleans a year ago.<br> We ordered a few rounds of drinks.<br> He seemed like a nice enough guy.<br> But when we talked politics<br> he got a nasty edge.<br> He said the government betrayed him<br> and he was out for revenge.<br> The way he said it scared me.<br> I said, "Nice talking to you. "<br> And I got the hell out of there.<br> For the life of me<br> I cannot remember his name.<br> But I'm pretty sure<br> he said he was from Phoenix.<br> You ought to talk to a guy<br> in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.<br> - We're going to Phoenix.<br> - Let's get a police artist.<br> - Have a sketch faxed to us.<br> - You figured that out by yourself?<br> - Kiss my ass, Frank.<br> - I told you you'd make a good agent.<br> That doesn't look much like him,<br> but it's got to be Mitch Leary.<br> - I haven't seen him in over a year.<br> - What do you know about the guy?<br> You see this wheelchair?<br> Mitch bought it for me.<br> It cost over $1,000.<br> - You see this?<br> - Take it easy now.<br> This is in case he ever comes back.<br> He accused me<br> of ripping off his design.<br> He said my penalty for disloyalty<br> was death.<br> If you put him away,<br> I'll sleep better.<br> - Where can we find him?<br> - I've got his address somewhere.<br> Don't move.<br> Drop it!<br> - Let him go, Horrigan.<br> - I got him.<br> It's okay. We're on the same team.<br> - Hands, motherfucker!<br> - I'm getting my identification!<br> - Give it to me.<br> - David Coppinger. CIA.<br> - And who's this asshole?<br> - He's with me.<br> - God dammit!<br> - Are you here for Leary or me?<br> Mr. Leary used to be<br> one of our operatives.<br> - He's threatened to kill the President.<br> - We didn't think he was serious.<br> - But you knew. You and the FBI.<br> - I understand your frustration.<br> You understand my frustration?<br> You pompous son of a bitch!<br> What did Leary do for you?<br> Run drugs? Sell arms to Iran?<br> It's a C-12 matter,<br> so this is off the record.<br> If asked, I'm going to deny it.<br> - Leary's what we call a wet boy.<br> - What's a wet boy, Frank?<br> - Leary's an assassin.<br> - He's more like a predator.<br> - Was that you shooting?<br> - Yes.<br> - What kind of gun is that?<br> - Something I made.<br> You made it?<br> That beats paying for it.<br> - Can I see it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's light. What's it made of?<br> - It's composite. Like plastic.<br> Pretty neat!<br> Mind if I give her a little dance?<br> - Not at all.<br> - Go for it.<br> That is great! That is really great!<br> - Would you sell it?<br> - No, I need it.<br> - For what?<br> - To assassinate the President.<br> - Why would you want to do that for?<br> - Why did you kill that bird?<br> Leary was one of our most effective<br> contractors, but times changed.<br> Cutbacks had to be made.<br> Leary didn't take it too well.<br> - We've not been able to locate him.<br> - We can work together on this.<br> - Wouldn't that be refreshing?<br> - We have fingerprints and photos.<br> - These are at least 15 years old.<br> - He's camera-shy.<br> He'll be in disguise, anyway.<br> We need photo alterations, Sam.<br> What I'm about to show you<br> is highly classified.<br> This is a former colleague<br> of Leary's. A close friend.<br> He went by Leary's home to try<br> and get him to accept counselling.<br> This is how Leary<br> treats his friends.<br> We need every possible variable.<br> Facial hair, glasses, weight change.<br> Keep in mind<br> he's 15 years older now.<br> As good as they are, they aren't<br> much good. The eyes are dead.<br> You can always tell a man<br> by his eyes.<br> - Tomorrow morning I'd like you to...<br> - I'm resigning tomorrow.<br> What?<br> What for? Because you were scared<br> down in Phoenix? I was scared too.<br> I have nightmares about that<br> boat with the bag over my head.<br> I can't breathe.<br> Phoenix clinched it.<br> - The service has counsellors.<br> - I've been to counsellors.<br> - We can get this guy.<br> - I can't do it!<br> Stop this cockamamie shit.<br> Come on, pal, I need you.<br> Please.<br> Okay, Frank.<br> Cockamamie. That's a word<br> your generation hasn't embraced yet.<br> You ought to use it once in a while<br> to keep it alive.<br> - Cockamamie!<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, God!<br> - Well, it made you laugh.<br> You kill me, Frank.<br> Hello, Frank. And let me welcome<br> all of you joining our programme.<br> I know who you are, Leary.<br> I'm glad. Friends should be able<br> to call each other by name.<br> - We're not friends.<br> - Sure, we are.<br> I've seen what you do to friends.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - You slit your friend's throat.<br> - You talked to Coppinger?<br> - Yeah.<br> Did you de-louse?<br> The man's a professional liar.<br> - I saw the photos.<br> - No, you saw what he wanted you to see.<br> I saw a picture of your friend<br> with his throat cut.<br> What you don't know<br> is that they sent my best friend...<br> ...to my home to kill me!<br> - Your voice is shaking.<br> - I haven't lied to you, Frank!<br> Everyone who ever knew you<br> says you're sick.<br> - Your colleagues. Your wife.<br> - What does your wife say about you?<br> Frank, I want you to understand.<br> We both used to think that this<br> country was a very special place.<br> Do you have any idea<br> what I've done for God and country?<br> Some horrible things!<br> I don't even remember who I was<br> before they got their claws into me.<br> - They made you into a real monster.<br> - And now they want to destroy me.<br> What do you see when you're in<br> the dark and the demons come?<br> I see you standing over the grave<br> of another dead President.<br> - That's not gonna happen.<br> - Fuck you, Frank.<br> I'm willing to trade my life<br> for his and that's all it takes.<br> That President is coming home<br> from California in a box.<br> - Where in California?<br> - The address?<br> I'll keep you in the game,<br> but I won't throw it for you.<br> - I want you to give yourself up.<br> - To live a long and fruitful life?<br> Don't lie to me.<br> I have a rendezvous with death.<br> So does the President.<br> And so do you, if you get too close.<br> - You have a rendezvous with my ass!<br> - You know how easily I could kill you?<br> I've watched you go home.<br> You are alive because<br> I have allowed you to live.<br> Show me some damn respect!<br> St. Francis Hotel!<br> Frank.<br> Take my hand, Frank.<br> Take it. If you don't, you'll die.<br> Take it.<br> You're gonna shoot me<br> after I saved your life?<br> The only way to save the President<br> is to shoot me.<br> Are you willing<br> to trade your life for his...<br> ...or is life too precious?<br> Leary, don't move!<br> I got him!<br> Al?<br> There's nothing here.<br> Frank, you've got a phone call.<br> Frank, you looked so sad on the bus.<br> I'm sorry, it was self-defence.<br> - Tell me about Skellum.<br> - Skellum is worthless.<br> - Are you gonna meet him in L.A.?<br> - You're way behind in the game.<br> I'm way ahead. I know what you<br> look like. I've seen your eyes.<br> - They might look different next time.<br> - Not what's behind them.<br> - You better pray I never find you.<br> - You want to kill me, Frank?<br> That's right.<br> - The irony's so thick here.<br> - There is no irony!<br> The same government that trained<br> me to kill, trained you to protect.<br> Now you want to kill me.<br> Up on that roof I protected you.<br> They'll write books about us.<br> - I'm tired of your bullshit!<br> - Don't be a poor sport.<br> You could have taken me out,<br> but you chose to save your ass.<br> It does make me wonder about Dallas.<br> Did you really do all you could,<br> or did you make a choice there too?<br> Do you really have the guts<br> to take a bullet?<br> I'll be thinking about that<br> when I'm pissing on your grave.<br> There's no one named Skellum<br> in all of Los Angeles?<br> - What about Louisiana?<br> - Hang on.<br> No Skellums. Sorry.<br> Damn it!<br> - The election's in three weeks.<br> - Just stay out of California.<br> If this guy's so smart, he's not gonna<br> tell you where he'll do it.<br> I don't think he'd lie to me.<br> You've become that close?<br> California is the key<br> to the whole race.<br> - We can't let up now.<br> - We have to change our procedure.<br> - Frisk people within 50 yards.<br> - At $10,000 dinners?<br> - You're overreacting.<br> - Lf I don't, the President's dead.<br> - Why is he even here?<br> - He's heading this investigation.<br> Then let him investigate,<br> but keep him out of sight.<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> I'm in the middle of a campaign.<br> Frank. Hi.<br> - Up late?<br> - L.A. Will be a lot of work.<br> - What's up?<br> - I've got a request.<br> I'd like you to talk to Watts.<br> Get me on your team.<br> - He thinks you'll overreact.<br> - What do you think?<br> - You're too close to all this.<br> - That's why I've got to be there.<br> - I can spot him. Anticipate him.<br> - You think he'll be in California?<br> - Why would he tip you off?<br> - He wants to keep the game close.<br> This has nothing to do with<br> you and me. Strictly professional.<br> But that son of a bitch<br> killed my partner. My friend.<br> I know. I'm sorry.<br> You're looking at a living legend.<br> The only active agent<br> who ever lost a President.<br> Please.<br> Mr. Horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.<br> Can the President close the gap<br> in the little time he has left?<br> Today he's in California for a rally<br> at the Bonaventure Hotel.<br> Field office, the advance team<br> is at the Bonaventure.<br> - Any problems?<br> - No.<br> We've swept the motorcade route.<br> Manholes are secured. Mailboxes<br> removed.
