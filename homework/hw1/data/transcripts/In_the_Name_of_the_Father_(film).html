Annie.<br> But her rubber glove<br> showed a faint trace.<br> And the children?<br> Positive.<br> The results may not<br> be good enough for court.<br> Your word will be<br> good enough for the court.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Kill the bastards!<br> Kill 'em!<br> Shoot the bastards!<br> Call number one.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Jesus, it's a nightmare, Giuseppe.<br> Just stay calm, be on your best<br> behaviour, and this'll be behind us soon.<br> That's it, come on.<br> It'll be all right.<br> All rise.<br> Sir Michael Hagerty will present<br> the case on behalf of the Crown.<br> There are two series of charges here,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> The four defendants in front...<br> are charged with 11 counts in relation<br> to the explosion of the Guildford pub...<br> and the murders of five people.<br> The Crown will show<br> that these were the bombers.<br> The seven defendants behind...<br> are charged with the possession<br> of explosives, not charged with murder.<br> The Crown's case<br> against them is...<br> that they are a support network<br> for the bombers, and as such...<br> - should be considered independent.<br> - Control yourself. Pay attention.<br> My first witness is<br> Inspector Robert Dixon.<br> I swear by Almighty God that the<br> evidence I give shall be the truth...<br> the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth.<br> Inspector, why do you believe<br> these four are the bombers?<br> First Hill, then Conlon,<br> Armstrong, Richardson...<br> confessed to the bombing.<br> They are the IRA's ASU.<br> Can you explain ASU for us?<br> Active Service Unit.<br> They are the elite of the IRA...<br> who carry out<br> the bombings and the shootings.<br> Often they are combat veterans with<br> experience of shooting at soldiers...<br> and planting explosives.<br> And the others...<br> Annie Maguire and her family?<br> They are the IRA's support network.<br> Their families and friends store<br> the weapons and explosives...<br> and they provide<br> what we call "safe houses."<br> Thank you, Inspector.<br> These people were arrested<br> two days...<br> after the Prevention<br> of Terrorism Act was introduced.<br> That's correct.<br> Can you explain, please, the powers<br> that this gives to the police?<br> It permits us to hold<br> suspected terrorists...<br> for a period of up to seven days.<br> Quite extraordinary powers<br> in a democracy.<br> Quite difficult, I would think for<br> the police to resist the temptation...<br> - to deal forcibly with people.<br> - Objection.<br> People they suspect of the biggest<br> bombing campaign on British mainland...<br> - since the Second World War.<br> - Objection. My lord, I really must...<br> - Get to the point!<br> - Now, this bombing campaign...<br> struck deep into the British people's<br> sense of security.<br> The people looked to you,<br> Inspector, to find those responsible.<br> Yes.<br> You must have been under<br> the most intense pressure.<br> That's my job.<br> Now, all of the defendants claim...<br> including young Patrick Maguire,<br> aged just 14...<br> Patrick,<br> would you stand up, please?<br> Thank you.<br> All of the defendants claim...<br> that they were subjected to physical and<br> mental abuse while in police custody.<br> They were never harmed<br> in any way.<br> He's fucking lying!<br> They beat the shite out of us!<br> Silence!<br> Please believe us!<br> They beat us!<br> Just be quiet.<br> Sit them down!<br> Silence in the court!<br> Mr Conlon says...<br> that you pulled him by the hair<br> and squeezed his testicles.<br> I never even spoke to Mr Conlon.<br> I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.<br> Silence!<br> Mr Hill says the police sat astride him<br> and put a gun in his mouth.<br> There was no pressure of any kind.<br> You can go and fuck yourself,<br> you lying fucking bastard!<br> Order! Order in court!<br> Inspector, in the case<br> of the four main defendants...<br> you have no corroborating evidence<br> of any kind.<br> I have the confessions of four obvious<br> terrorists. What more do you want?<br> Well, nitroglycerine<br> is a highly toxic substance.<br> It's when the substance<br> to be tested...<br> After a fewweeks,<br> we were bored out of our minds...<br> just messed around<br> and that there.<br> They must've been<br> desperate for evidence.<br> They produced Annie's washing-up gloves<br> like a rabbit out of a hat at one point.<br> Then it was my turn<br> to take the stand.<br> Mr Conlon,<br> did you bomb Guildford?<br> No, I didn't.<br> The police claim that you were in<br> Guildford on the night of the bombing.<br> Can you tell us where you were?<br> I was in a park in London<br> at that time.<br> - Who with?<br> - With Paul Hill sitting there.<br> You met somebody else that night,<br> about 8:00 p.m.<br> - Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.<br> - And who is he?<br> He was just a fellow,<br> a homeless guy that we met in the park.<br> Why do you remember<br> this man so clearly?<br> I was thinking that if I didn't get out<br> ofLondon fast, I would end up like him.<br> - You told this to the police?<br> - Aye.<br> - What did they say?<br> - They said he didn't exist.<br> Mr Conlon, why did you confess<br> to the Guildford bombing?<br> They beat me...<br> and then they threatened<br> to kill my father.<br> - Will you repeat that please?<br> - They terrorized me for seven days.<br> After that,<br> they threatened to kill my father.<br> I'd have fucking signed anything<br> after that.<br> - Excuse my language.<br> - Thank you.<br> You expect thisjury to believe<br> that decorated police officers...<br> would risk their career<br> and their reputation...<br> by threatening your father?<br> I don't expect them to believe it<br> by the time you finish with them...<br> but it happens to be truth.<br> You're an honest man,<br> aren't you, Mr Conlon?<br> I like to think so.<br> You've told us you remember<br> this Charlie Burke very well.<br> Aye.<br> Do you remember telling the police<br> anything else about that night?<br> Let me refresh your memory.<br> You told Inspector Dixon...<br> that you had committed<br> a robbery on that night.<br> Now do you remember?<br> Aye.<br> - Who did you rob?<br> - Robbed a hooker.<br> - You robbed a prostitute?<br> - Aye.<br> And we are expected to believe a man<br> who claims he stole from a prostitute...<br> before we would believe ten police<br> officers who stood here on oath...<br> and called you a liar?<br> That was the truth.<br> I'm bound to say I don't find<br> you very convincing.<br> Thank you, Mr Conlon.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> that you'd stole from that woman?<br> You should've called me.<br> I would've sent the money.<br> Are you gonna be a thief<br> and a liar all your life?<br> Standing up in that witness box,<br> making faces to your mates.<br> At least you told the truth<br> in there. That'll stand you.<br> Are you not going<br> to eat that sausage?<br> They put a gun in my mouth...<br> and made me confess<br> to a murder I didn't commit.<br> So I said I did the big bombing...<br> and named anybody I knew<br> who was not in the IRA.<br> Not in the IRA?<br> - Definitely not in the IRA.<br> - Why?<br> You know why.<br> I just wanted to show<br> howridiculous it all was.<br> Inspector, the defendant Conlon<br> presented an alibi...<br> One Charlie Burke.<br> That name did appear in Mr Conlon's<br> statement. We investigated it.<br> We couldn't find any trace<br> of such a person.<br> And there was this question<br> of the robbery of a prostitute.<br> No robberies were reported<br> in that area that night.<br> At the start of this trial,<br> I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.<br> Subsequently, I was deeply shocked<br> when a fellowattorney came to me...<br> and asked me if I was now<br> going to wash my hand.<br> In my long legal career,<br> I cannot remember a case...<br> where emotions have<br> been so charged.<br> It falls to me now<br> to appeal to you...<br> the members of thejury,<br> not to get caught up in this...<br> tide of mass hysteria.<br> Inspector Dixon admits there are scores<br> ofinconsistencies in the confessions.<br> My clients contend that<br> they were forced to confess...<br> through brutality<br> and intimidation.<br> Now, they may be foolish...<br> petty thieves,<br> even drug abusers...<br> but they are not the ruthless bombers<br> who have terrorized Britain for months.<br> You should find these young people<br> not guilty.<br> - Bollocks!<br> - Okay, let's go.<br> - Get your fucking hands off me!<br> - Move it!<br> - Move it!<br> - Hands off!<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> like my learned colleague<br> in the defence...<br> I would caution you not<br> to be swayed by your emotions.<br> The four people<br> you see in the front...<br> are one of the most cunning and<br> cruel criminal conspiracies...<br> ever to set foot on English soil.<br> Now, here are the facts<br> of this case:<br> Inspector Dixon...<br> a decorated officer<br> of great expertise...<br> acting on reliable information<br> and good detective work...<br> arrested Paul Hill...<br> who, guilt-ridden by the shame<br> of his crime, confessed.<br> That confession led the police<br> to the ringleader, Conlon...<br> and his terrorist family...<br> his aunt, Annie Maguire,<br> the experienced bomb maker...<br> who wore rubber gloves<br> when handling explosives...<br> in the kitchen<br> of her home in Harlesden.<br> She even allowed her children<br> to handle explosives...<br> Vincent, aged 16,<br> Patrick, 14...<br> who did not... could not...<br> knowany better.<br> Giuseppe Conlon,<br> her brother-in-law...<br> the courier who arrived<br> with more explosives.<br> Armstrong and his dupe<br> Richardson, who carried the bomb.<br> Now, these are the people who,<br> in a panic...<br> had to dispose<br> of the nitroglycerine...<br> and that is what sealed<br> their fate.<br> How do we know this?<br> Because the truth was on their hands.<br> It is a story written<br> in the blood of their victims.<br> You have seen some of those<br> who survived...<br> their callous disregard<br> for human life.<br> It is now your duty<br> to protect society from them.<br> I am confident that<br> that is what you will do.<br> Have you reached a verdict?<br> Yes, we have, my lord.<br> - How do you find the defendants?<br> - Guilty as charged.<br> Hang the Irie bastards!<br> Order! Silence!<br> String 'em up!<br> Gerard Patrick Conlon.<br> Stand up.<br> I feel it is my duty<br> to wonder aloud...<br> why you were not charged<br> with treason to the Crown...<br> a charge that carries a penalty<br> of death by hanging...<br> a sentence I would have had<br> no difficulty in passing...<br> in this case.<br> I sentence you<br> to life imprisonment...<br> and I instruct<br> that you shall serve...<br> a minimum of 30 years.<br> Take him down.<br> Help me.<br> Paul Michael Hill.<br> In my view, your crime<br> is such that...<br> life shall mean life.<br> Annie Maguire,<br> I recommend you serve 14 years!<br> - What have I done, for Christ's sake?<br> - Take her down!<br> - Giuseppe Conlon, 12 years.<br> - No, my husband's innocent!<br> Lord have mercy on you!<br> Patrick Joseph Armstrong,<br> Carole Richardson,<br> Our case was so insane that if you<br> made it up, nobody would believe it.<br> Look, Gareth, I know people say<br> that I'm a compulsive storyteller...<br> and nobody believed<br> a word I said in court...<br> but Charlie Burke did exist... he's not<br> just a figment of my imagination.<br> Sorry.<br> We were shipped off<br> to Park Royal Prison...<br> an old Victorian fortress where the<br> most dangerous criminals were held...<br> in the maximum-security wing.<br> - Place of birth.<br> - Belfast.<br> Then you're British.<br> This is your home<br> for the rest of your life.<br> So accept it and get on with it.<br> Right, come this way.<br> The chief warder, Barker...<br> gave us blue denim uniforms<br> with yellow stripes.<br> We were Category A...<br> the highest-security class along<br> with the rapists and murderers.<br> My father said<br> we'd fight for an appeal...<br> but I didn't want to know<br> about the legal system.<br> - I'm going back to the cell.<br> - Come on. Followme.<br> Come on, Gerry.<br> Hey, Ronnie.<br> There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.<br> Irish scum.<br> My name's Giuseppe Conlon.<br> I'm an innocent man.<br> So is my son.<br> We shouldn't even be in here.<br> Get that fucking scum<br> off my floor.<br> I said, knock it off!<br> - They must know they've made a mistake.<br> - No, they don't.<br> The proof of our innocence<br> must be there in the evidence.<br> We have to fight 'em<br> to get an appeal.<br> - I'll speak to Father Wilson.<br> - Speak to everybody.<br> We'll write letters from in here.<br> Start a campaign.<br> Have they been<br> treating you all right?<br> Aye, fine.
