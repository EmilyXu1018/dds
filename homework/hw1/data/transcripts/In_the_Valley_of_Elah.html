You call me to invite me<br> a swig?<br> No, he/she hoped you even worked in the base.<br> I look for an expensive friend.<br> Some of your children this in problems?<br> - No.<br> I always forget their name, he/she is Ben.<br> - David.<br> Correct, the one managed airplanes in the armada, certain<br> - If.<br> Should it be strong, how him this llendo?<br> He died in a crash<br> of helicopter making<br> you have maneuvered for ten years.<br> I sit down to listen that, Hank.<br> I sit down it a lot.<br> What is there of the but young?<br> Mike.<br> - If.<br> Of the I exercise as their father.<br> It was him/her well in Iraq.<br> I am making him/her a<br> favor, one of their muchahos<br> this in problems<br> Some of those that we even know this<br> there?<br> No, all have left.<br> She wants to arrive quick.<br> The children are waiting for us.<br> I found their old notebook.<br> Is something written that says key?<br> No, there is not anything of that.<br> These sure one?<br> If this but I don't sit down with desires of<br> to tell it to you.<br> Don't worry Hank, he/she will already appear.<br> He is a good boy, you that it is it.<br> I will find it.<br> I call you tomorrow.<br> What this happening?<br> Don't worry, not this related with<br> animals.<br> What?<br> We find parts of a body in<br> the highway.<br> He/she looks, there this your family.<br> He/she stops to joke with that.<br> Shit.<br> Shit!<br> What do I make?!<br> Don't stop.<br> Don't stop!<br> Hurry!<br> - Hold on to!<br> What do you make?<br> Some evidence but Marcus?<br> It is all that we have.<br> See to buy some glasses descartables,<br> we go.<br> And bring me a receipt!<br> Shawn?!<br> Do tell me that you discovered?<br> Good it seems that it kills her it was murdered the one<br> side of that fire.<br> Then the body you burns, the animals<br> they made it pieces.<br> And is this our jurisdiction?<br> Good, this seems to have been ago<br> two months.<br> The property of the city<br> alone he/she extends until<br> this fence<br> I don't believe that it is our body, boss.<br> Hallelujah, let us go home!<br> Boys pack!<br> The soldiers took charge of this!<br> Mr. Deerfield?<br> Am I Jim Mosher, can I speak with you?<br> If, ahead, alone gives me one minute.<br> Mr., I sit down to inform him/her that a body<br> it was opposing last night<br> The investigation says that<br> they can be their son's remains<br> Correct, does he/she need him to identify the body?<br> Not Mister, they identified the body of<br> another way...<br> I believe that for partial fingerprints.<br> To that refers with partial?<br> What do I pass him/her?<br> Not I can say it Mister, somebody of the base...<br> I want to see their body now!<br> Agent Deerfield, this is not necessary.<br> Not it is the way like he/she should remember<br> to their son.<br> Perhaps not.<br> ... but it is the way like accent the earth,<br> so I want to see it.<br> The pattern shows that<br> the body was desmenbrado<br> before being burnt.<br> It perishes to have been with<br> a he/she arms piercing but even<br> we don't know with accuracy<br> that steel type.<br> For that reason the bones are cut and<br> not pulled up.<br> The pattern of the burnt sample parts<br> of the mienbros they were stabbed<br> and they put a fuel with intention<br> of burning the body.<br> It is ridiculous because it should it should not have cold<br> so that the fire spreads<br> What means that the<br> majority of the fabrics<br> So the damages are bigger in this part,<br> but I don't arrive to the bone<br> the cause of death<br> he/she delayed a little in knowing it<br> but there is multiple stabbed<br> How many?<br> How many stabbed?<br> Good with so much alone lost skin we will be able to<br> to count those that arrived to the bone.<br> Would how many be those?<br> A knife or several?<br> One.<br> did you give this to the I exercise?<br> They took their own pictures.<br> And they didn't make it very well.<br> If this well would like me<br> to ask him/her some things<br> when it arrives home.<br> Wonder them now.<br> Their son taenia a green car?<br> Mike non taenia a car.<br> Report they say that they saw it a green car<br> in the field on Saturday in the night.<br> A theory says it can have been a robbery<br> that I finish bad.<br> There is a lot of activity of robberies lately.<br> I want to see where he/she died.<br> I sit down it, it is even one<br> scene of the crime, but<br> I will warn him/her he/she hardly can.<br> This well.<br> What but he/she wanted to ask?<br> All this seems to have been<br> related with I traffic of drugs.<br> He/she asks me if my son was a trafficker of<br> you drug or alone an addict.<br> Not he/she wanted to ask him/her he/she swims.<br> You know that the one exercises ago<br> you prove regular with drugs.<br> Not when they are in Iraq.<br> We find this below of the mattress<br> of their son.<br> Non anger in my report.<br> I ask because last month we arrest<br> to 3 soldiers that tried<br> of bringing heroine from Kuwait.<br> They sold it to the gangs<br> Mexicans.<br> I understand that the wise one Spanish.<br> And you believe that it can have trafficked with<br> it drugs alone because he/she speaks Spanish.<br> No.<br> Because somebody cuts him/her the hands and<br> the head.<br> I sit down that of their son a lot.<br> Demonstrate it to me.<br> Do I sit down it?<br> I need to see where he/she died.<br> Not it is our case<br> the murder happened in another district.<br> But you know where it is.<br> Not there is anything to see.<br> Then there won't be problems<br> if I see it.<br> It is noticed that they know how to examine a scene of the crimer<br> I suppose that they thought that serious a good one<br> he/she devises to murder it here.<br> Their investigators found blood<br> in this part<br> here it should be murdered.<br> You don't see blood but he/she knows that it is there.<br> If.<br> It seems that their body was dragged<br> from here<br> until there.<br> That is impressive.<br> The road this clean one but you<br> you see marks of blood.<br> If they took the nuisance<br> of burning their body<br> he/she doesn't believe that also<br> they would cover their prints.<br> I will go to the bathroom.<br> If he/she entered with their car he/she would not make so much<br> I damage as the one that you leave<br> It seems that he/she knows everything.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Can I help him?<br> I suppose that the police<br> he/she has come to ask him/her<br> that I pass in that field.<br> If, they made it that terrible what you/they found.<br> I come on behalf of the family,<br> does something know about what I happen there?<br> Deseaia to know it, we didn't know what was<br> neither when we smelled it, certain affection?<br> Pardon?<br> That Sunday in the morning when we enter to the one<br> parking lot<br> we think that they had made barbecue<br> of somebody.<br> He/she smelled like to burnt meat.<br> Thank you.<br> Tell to their team that you/they should look for a car<br> blue and I don't unite green.<br> Because a blue car but the yellow lights<br> it is green.<br> It seems that if.<br> It is it less than I can make.<br> He/she would say that that is not enough.<br> I will buy an airplane passage.<br> To that refer with which not?<br> I will take it to house he/she hardly can.<br> I need to see it, I need to be with Michael.<br> It is he/she has left.<br> I need to be with my boy.<br> Not it has been anything of the one.<br> What devils does that mean?<br> Joan for once in your life you make I marry.<br> I remember to have been him/her the one that not said<br> when your you said that<br> serious good for their character<br> Who do win that
