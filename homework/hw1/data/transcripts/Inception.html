                        Hey! Come here!<br> We have a man on the shore!<br> I'm on my way.<br> He was hallucinating,<br> but he mentioned your name...<br> He only had this with him...<br> And this.<br> Are you here to kill me?<br> I know what this is.<br> I've seen one before.<br> Many, many years ago.<br> It belonged to a man I met<br> in a half-remembered dream.<br> A man possessed of some radical notions.<br> What is the most resilient parasite?<br> Bacteria? A virus?<br> An intestinal worm?<br> What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...<br> - An idea.<br> Resilient. Highly contagious.<br> Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,<br> it's almost impossible to eradicate.<br> An idea that is fully formed,<br> fully understood that sticks.<br> - Right in there somewhere.<br> - For someone like you to steal?<br> Yes. In the dream state, your<br> conscious defense is lowered<br> and it makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.<br> It's called extraction.<br> Sir Saito, we can train your<br> subconscious to defend itself from even<br> - the most skilled extractor.<br> - How can I do that?<br> Cause I am the most skilled extractor.<br> I know how to search your<br> mind and find your secrets.<br> I know the tricks. And I can teach them<br> to you so even when you're asleep<br> your defense is never down.<br> Look, if you want my help, you're gonna<br> have to be completely open with me.<br> I need to know my way around<br> your thoughts better than your wife<br> better than your therapist,<br> better than anyone.<br> If this is a dream and you<br> have a safe full of secrets<br> I need to know what's in that safe.<br> In order for this all to work,<br> you need to completely let me in.<br> Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.<br> But I'll consider your proposal.<br> He knows.<br> What's going on up there?<br> Saito knows.<br> He's playing with us.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I can get it here. Trust me.<br> The information is in the safe.<br> He looked right at it when I mentioned "secrets".<br> What's she doing here?<br> Just head back to the room, alright.<br> I'll take care of this.<br> Okay, make sure you do.<br> We're here to work.<br> If I jump, would I survive?<br> A clean dive, perhaps.<br> Mal, what are you doing here?<br> I thought you might be missing me.<br> You know that I am.<br> But I can't trust you anymore.<br> So what?<br> Looks like Arthur's taste.<br> Actually, the subject is partial<br> disposal of British painters.<br> Please, have a seat.<br> Tell me...<br> Did the two kids miss me?<br> You can't imagine.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Getting some fresh air. Stay where you are, Mal.<br> Goddamn it.<br> - Turn around.<br> - Put the gun down.<br> Please.<br> Now, the envelope Mr. Cobb.<br> Did she tell you?<br> Have you known all along?<br> That you're here to steal from me<br> or that we are actually asleep?<br> I want to know the<br> name of your employer.<br> There's no use in threatening<br> within a dream right, Mal ?<br> That depends on what you're threatening.<br> Killing him will just wake him up.<br> But pain...<br> Pain is in the mind and judging by<br> the decor we're in your mind right, Arthur?<br> - What are you doing? It's too soon!<br> - I know. But the dream has collapsed.<br> Just try to keep Saito lie a little bit longer.<br> We're almost there.<br> This place.<br> The paintings.<br> Stop him!<br> I think that's gonna work.<br> Wake him up!<br> You awake!<br> - Give him the kick!<br> - What?<br> Drop him.<br> He's up.<br> You came prepared, hmm?<br> Not even my head of security<br> knows this apartment.<br> How did you find it?<br> It's very difficult for a man of your position<br> to keep a love nest like this secret<br> particularly when there's a<br> married woman involved.<br> - She will never...<br> - Yet, here we are.<br> - For the dilemma.<br> - They're getting closer.<br> - You got what you need.<br> - Well, it's not true.<br> You left out a key piece<br> of information, didn't you?<br> You held something back because<br> you knew what we were up to.<br> Question is why do<br> you let us in at all?<br> - An audition.<br> - An audition for what?<br> Doesn't matter.<br> You failed.<br> We extracted every bit of<br> information you had in there.<br> But your dream approach is obvious.<br> So leave me alone.<br> You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.<br> The operation that hired us...<br> they won't accept failure.<br> We won't last two days.<br> Cobb?<br> Looks like I'm gonna have to<br> do this a little more simply.<br> Tell us what you know!<br> Tell us what you know, now!<br> I've always hated this carpet.<br> It stain and fade in such distinctive ways.<br> That way you know it's made of wool.<br> But now...<br> ...a line of polyester.<br> Which means I'm not lying on<br> my carpet in my apartment.<br> You have lived after your reputation, Mr. Cobb.<br> I'm still dreaming.<br> - Where did he go?<br> - We're not getting paid.<br> Dream within a dream, huh.<br> I'm impressed.<br> But in my dream,<br> you play by my rules.<br> - Yes, but you see Mr. Saito...<br> - We're not in your dream.<br> We're in mine.<br> Asshole.<br> How did you mess up the carpet?<br> - It wasn't my fault.<br> - You're the architect.<br> - I don't know he's gonna rub his damn cheek on it!<br> - That's enough.<br> - You, what the hell is all that?<br> - I have it under control.<br> I didn't see it under control.<br> We don't have time for this.<br> I'm getting off at Kyoto.<br> Why?<br> We still have to check every compartment.<br> I don't like trains.<br> Listen.<br> Every man for himself.<br> - Yes, hello.<br> - Hi, daddy.<br> Hi, dad..<br> Hey guys, hey.<br> How are you? How are you doing, huh?<br> Good.<br> - Okay, I guess.<br> - Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?<br> - Yeah, when are you coming home, dad?<br> Well, I can't sweetheart. I can't.<br> - It's not for a while, remember?<br> - Why?<br> I told you, I'm away<br> because I'm working, right?<br> Grandma says you're<br> never coming back.<br> Phillipa, is that you?<br> Put grandma on the phone for me, will you?<br> She's shaking her head.<br> Let's just hope she's wrong about that.<br> - Daddy?<br> - Yeah, James ?<br> Is Mommy with you?<br> James, we've talked about this.<br> Mommy's not here anymore.<br> Where?<br> That's enough, kids.<br> Say bye bye..<br> Listen, I wanna send some<br> presents with grandpa, alright?<br> And you be good,, you be...<br> - Our ride's on the roof.<br> - Alright.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.<br> - Why?<br> - Locked down in a dream, Mal showing up.<br> Sorry about your leg,<br> it won't happen again.<br> It's getting worse, isn't it?<br> One apology is all<br> you're getting huh, Arthur.<br> - Where's Nash ?<br> - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?<br> No, we're supposed to go over Saito's<br> expansion plans in Cobol Engineering<br> two hours ago. By now, they know we failed.<br> It's time we disappear.<br> - Where would you even go?<br> - Buenos Aires.<br> I'll cut my load, I may slip out a<br> job when things quiet down.<br> - You?<br> - States, sir.<br> Send my regards.<br> He sold the art. Fell off the company<br> and bargained for his life.<br> So I offer you the satisfaction.<br> It's not the way I deal with things.<br> - What will you do with him?<br> - Nothing.<br> But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.<br> - What do you want from us?<br> - Inception.<br> - Is it possible?<br> - Of course not.<br> If you can steal an idea from someone's mind<br> why can't you plant one idea instead.<br> Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.<br> I say to you...<br> "Don't think about elephants".<br> - What are you thinking about?<br> - Elephants.<br> Right. But it's not your idea<br> because you know I gave it to you.<br> The subject's mind can always<br> trace the genesis of the idea.<br> - True inspiration's impossible to fake.<br> - It's not true.<br> - Can you do it?<br> - Are you offering me a choice?<br> Cause I can find my own<br> way to square things with Cobol.<br> - You don't need to have a choice.<br> - And I choose to leave, sir.<br> Tell the crew where you want to go.<br> Hey, Mr. Cobb!<br> How would you like to go home?<br> To America ?<br> - To your children?<br> - Can't fix that!<br> - No one can!<br> - Just like inception.<br> Cobb, come on.<br> How complex is the idea?<br> - Simple enough.<br> - No idea is simple...<br> when you need to plant it<br> in somebody else's mind.<br> My main competitor is an<br> old man in poor health<br> His son will soon inherit<br> control of the corporation.<br> I need him to decide to<br> break up his father's empire.<br> - Cobb, we should walk away from this.<br> - Hold on.<br> If I were to do this...If I even could do it<br> I need a guarantee<br> How do I know you can deliver?<br> You don't<br> But I can.<br> So, do you want to take a leap of faith?<br> Or become an old man filled<br> with regrets, waiting to die alone?<br> Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.<br> And choose your people more wisely.<br> Look, I know how much<br> you wanna go home.<br> - But this can't be done.<br> - Yes, it can.<br> - You just have to go deep enough.<br> - You don't know that.<br> I've done it before.<br> Who'd you do it to?<br> Are we going to Paris?<br> We're gonna need a new architect.<br> You never did like your office, did you?<br> No space to think in<br> that room covered.<br> Is it safe for you to be here?<br> Extradition between France and the United States<br> is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.<br> I think they might find a way<br> to make it work in your case<br> Look, I..brought this for you to give<br> to the kids when you have a chance.<br> It will take more than the<br> occasional stuffed animal<br> to convince those children<br> they still have a father.<br> I'm just doing what I know.<br> - I'm doing what you taught me.<br> - I never taught you to be a thief.<br> No, you taught me to navigate people's<br> minds but after what happened<br> They wanna hold our legitimate<br> ways for me to use that skill.<br> What are you doing here, Dom?<br> I think I found a way home.<br> It's a job for some very very<br> powerful people.<br> People who I believe can<br> fix my charges permanently..<br> - But I need your help.<br> - You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.<br> You know what I'm offering.<br> You have to let them decide for themselves.<br> - Money.<br> - Not just money. You remember. It's...<br> the chance to build cathedrals,<br> entire cities, things that never existed.<br> Things that couldn't exist in the real world.<br> So, you want me to let someone<br> else follow you into your fantasy.<br> They don't actually come in to the dream.<br> They just design the levels...<br> and teach them to the dreamers.<br> That's all.<br> Design it yourself.<br> Mal won't let me.<br> Come back to reality, Dom.<br> Please.<br> Those kids, your grandchildren-<br> they're waiting for their father to come back home.<br> That's their reality. And this job,<br> this last job that's how I get there.<br> I would not be standing here<br> if I knew any other way.<br> I need an architect<br> who's as good as I was.<br> I got somebody better.<br> Ariadne?<br> I'd like you to meet, Mr. Cobb.<br> - Please to meet you.<br> - If you have a few moments...<br> Mr. Cobb has a job offer<br> he'd like to discuss with you.<br> - Is the work pretty soon?<br> - Not exactly.<br> - I have a test for you.<br> - You're not gonna tell me anything about this first?<br> Before I describe the job,<br> I have to know you can do it.<br> - Why?<br> - It's not, strictly speaking, legal.<br> Two minutes, design a maze<br> that it takes one minute to solve.<br> Stop.<br> Again.<br> Stop.<br> You have to do better than that.<br> That's more like it.<br> They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true<br> potential. Now, that's when we're awake.<br> When we're asleep, the mind<br> can do almost anything.<br> - Such as?<br> - Well, imagine you're designing a building, right?<br> You consciously create each aspect.<br> But sometimes, it feels like it's almost<br> creating itself. If you know what I mean.<br> - Yeah, yeah. Like, uhmm, discovering.<br> - Genuine inspiration, right?<br> Now in a dream, our mind<br> continuously does this. We...<br> create and perceive our world simultaneously.<br> And our mind does this so well<br> that we don't even know it's happening.<br> That allows us to get right<br> into the middle of that process.<br> - How?<br> - By taking over the creating part.<br> Now, this is where I need you.<br> You create the world of the dream.<br> We bring the subject into that dream.<br> And they feel it's their subconscious.<br> How can I ever acquire enough detail<br> to make them think that it's reality.<br> Well, dreams they feel<br> real while we're in them, right?<br> It's only when we wake up that we realize<br> something was actually strange.<br> Let me ask you a question. You never really<br> remember the beginning of a dream, do you?<br> You always wind up right in<br> the middle of what's going on.<br> - I guess, yeah.<br> - So how did we end up here?<br> - Well, we just came from the...<br> - Think about it, Ariadne.<br> How did you get here?<br> Where are you right now?<br> - We're dreaming?<br> - You're actually in the middle of<br> the workshop right now, sleeping.<br> And this is your first lesson in<br> shared dreaming, so there you go.<br> If it's just a dream<br> then why are you...<br> It's never just a dream, is it?<br> When your face is full of glass<br> feels like hell.<br> When you're in it, it feels real.<br> It's what the military developed.<br> During that time, it was a training program<br> for soldiers to shoot and stab and<br> strangle each other and then wake up?<br> How did architects think they belong?<br> Well, someone had to<br> design the dreams, right?<br> - Why don't you give us another five minutes?<br> - Five minutes?<br> We were talking for like at least an hour.<br> In a dream, your mind functions<br> more quickly therefore...<br> time seems to feel more slow.<br> Five minutes in the world<br> gives you an hour in the dream.<br> Why don't we see what you<br> can get up to in five minutes?<br> We got the basic layout.<br> Bookstore, cafe.<br> Almost everything else is here to.<br> - Who are the people?<br> - Projections of my subconscious.<br> - Yours?<br> - Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer.<br> You built this world. I am the<br> subject, my mind populates it.<br> You can literally talk<br> to my subconscious.<br> That's one of the ways we extract<br> information from a subject.<br> - How else do you do it?<br> - By creating something secure, like a...<br> like a bank vault or a jail.<br> The mind automatically fills it with<br> information it's trying to protect.<br> - Understand?<br> - Then you break in and steal it.<br> Well...<br> I guess I thought that the dream space should<br> be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.<br> My question is, what happens when you<br> start messing with the physics of it all?<br> - Something, isn't it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> Why are they all looking at me?<br> Cause my subconscious feels that<br> someone else is creating this world.<br> The more you change things,<br> the quicker the projections<br> start to converge them.<br> - Converge?<br> - It sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.<br> They attack like white blood<br> cells fighting an infection.<br> - Are they going to attack us?<br> - No. Just you.<br> This is great but I'm telling you,<br> if you keep changing things like this...<br> Jesus. Mind telling your<br> subconscious to take it easy?<br> It's my subconscious.<br> Remember, I can't control it.<br> Very impressive.<br> I know this bridge.<br> This place is real, isn't it?<br> Yeah, I cross it everyday<br> to get to the college.<br> Never recreate places from your memory.<br> Always imagine new places.<br> Well, you gotta draft from<br> stuff you know, right?<br> Only use details.<br> A street lamp or a phone booth.<br> - Never entire areas.<br> - Why not?<br> Because building a dream from<br> your memory is the easiest way<br> to lose your grasp from what's<br> real and what is a dream.<br> Is that what happened to you?<br> Listen to me.<br> This has nothing to do with me, understand?<br> Is that why you need me<br> to build your dreams?<br> Get off of her.<br> Back up.<br> - Back up!<br> - Cobb!<br> - Get off me!<br> - Let me go!<br> - Don't! Mal!<br> - Cobb!<br> - Mal!<br> - Wake me up!<br> - Mal!<br> - Wake me up!<br> - Mal, No! No!<br> - Wake me up!<br> Mal, no!<br> Hey, hey, hey, look at me.<br> You're okay.<br> - You're okay.<br> - Why...why wouldn't I wake up?<br> Cause there were still some time on the<br> clock and you can't wake up within a dream<br> unless you die.<br> - Show me the totem.<br> - What?<br> - A totem, it's a small, personal...<br> - That's some subconscious you got on you, Cobb!<br> - She's a real charmer.<br> - Oh I see, you met Mrs. Cobb.<br> - She's his wife.<br> - Yeah. So, a totem.<br> You need a small object to potentially have you...<br> something you have all the time.<br> that no one else knows.<br> - Like a coin?<br> - No. It must be more unique than that.<br> This is a loaded die.<br> I can't let you touch it.<br> That would defeat the purpose.<br> Only I, know the balance and the<br> weight of this particular loaded die.<br> That way, when you<br> look at your totem,<br> You know beyond a doubt<br> that you're not in someone else's dream.<br> I don't know if you can't see what's<br> going on or if you just don't want to<br> but Cobb has some serious problems<br> that he's trying to bury down there.<br> And I'm not about to just open<br> my mind to someone like that.<br> She'll be back. I've never seen anyone<br> pick it up that quickly before.<br> Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.<br> And when she comes back...<br> If she comes back, you're gonna<br> have her building mazes.<br> - Where are you gonna be?<br> - I gotta go visit Eames.<br> Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.<br> It's Cobol's backyard.<br> - It's a necessary risk.<br> - There is plenty of good thieves.<br> We don't just need a thief.<br> We need a forger.<br> You can rub them together all you want,<br> but they're not gonna breed.<br> - You'll never know.<br> - Let me get you a drink.<br> You might.<br> - Your spelling hasn't improved.<br> - Test me.<br> How's your handwriting?<br> - The best in town.<br> - Good.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Inception.<br> Now, before you bother<br> telling me it's impossible...<br> No, it's perfectly possible.<br> It's just bloody difficult.<br> - Interesting.<br> - So Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.<br> Arthur...<br> You still work with that stick and mind?<br> - He's good at what he does, right?<br> - Oh, he's the best. He has no imagination.<br> Not like you.<br> Listen, if you're gonna perform<br> inception you need imagination.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> Have you done it before?<br> We tried it. We got the idea in<br> place. But it didn't take.<br> - You didn't plant it deep enough?<br> - No, it's not just about depth.<br> You need the simplest version<br> of the idea in order for it...<br> to grow naturally in your subjects.<br> Mind is a very subtle art.<br> So what is this idea that you need to plant?<br> We need the heir of a major corporation<br> to dissolve his father's empire.<br> Well. you see right there, you have various political<br> motivations and anti-manipulistic sentiments to set forth.<br> And with all that stuff, it's really<br> at the mercy of your subject's prejudice.<br> And what you have to do is<br> start with the absolute basic.<br> - Which is what?<br> - The relationship with the father.<br> - Do you have a chemist?<br> - No, not yet.<br> Alright, well there is a man here. Yusuf.<br> He formulate his own versions of the compounds.<br> - When are you taking me there?<br> - Once you lost your tail.<br> - Men at the bar.<br> - Cobol Engineering.<br> That price on my head,<br> was that dead or alive?<br> I don't remember.<br> Let's see if they start shooting.<br> Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs<br> in the bar in, say, in half an hour.<br> - Be back here?<br> - It's the last place they'd suspect.<br> Alright.<br> Freddy ! Freddy Simmons.<br> My God, it's you, isn't it?<br> - Who?<br> - No, it isn't.<br> You're not dreaming now, are you?<br> Stay out!<br> No, cafe.<br> One cafe.<br> Cafe.<br> Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?<br> - What are you doing in Mombasa?<br> - I need to protect my investments.<br> Ah, so this is your idea<br> of losing your tail, huh.<br> Different tail.<br> Cobb said you'd be back.<br> - I tried not to come, but...<br> - But there's nothing quite like it.<br> It's just... pure creation.<br> Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?<br> You're gonna have to master a few tricks<br> if you're gonna build three<br> complete dream levels.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - What kind of tricks?<br> In a dream, you can cheat<br> architecture into impossible shapes.<br> That lets you create closed loops.<br> Like the Penrose Steps.<br> Infinite staircase.<br> See?<br> Paradox. So a closed loop like that will help you<br> disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.<br> How big do these levels have to be?<br> It could be anything from the<br> floor of a building to an entire city.<br> But they have to be complicated enough...<br> that we can hide from the projection.<br> - A maze.<br> - Right, a maze.<br> - And the better the maze...<br> - Then the longer we have...<br> - ...before the projections catch us?<br> - Exactly.<br> My subconscious<br> seems quiet enough.<br> You wait till it turns ugly.<br> No one likes to feel someone else<br> is messing around with their mind.<br> Cobb can't build anymore, can he?<br> I don't know if he can't,<br> but he won't.<br> He thinks it's safer if<br> he doesn't know the layouts.<br> - Why?<br> - He won't tell me.<br> But I think it's Mal.<br> - His ex-wife?<br> - No, not his ex.<br> - They're still together?<br> - No, she's...<br> She's dead.<br> What you're seeing there<br> is just his projection of her.<br> - What was she like in real life?<br> - She's lovely.<br> - You are seeking a chemist?<br> - Yes.<br> To formulate compounds for a job?<br> - And to go into the field with us.<br> - No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.<br> We'd need you there to tell the<br> compounds specific to our needs.<br> - Which are?<br> - Great depth.<br> A dream within a dream?<br> Two levels?<br> Three.<br> Not possible. That many dreams<br> within dreams is too unstable.<br> - It is possible you just had to have a sedative.<br> - Well, powerful sedative.<br> - How many team members?<br> - Five<br> Six.<br> The only way to know you've<br> done the job is if I am with you.<br> There's no room for tourists<br> on a job like this, Mr. Saito.<br> This time, it seems there is.<br> This, I think, is a good place to start.<br> I use it everyday.<br> - What for?<br> - Yeah, I'll show you.<br> - Perhaps you will not want to see.<br> - After you.<br> Six, ten, twelve.<br> All connected, bloody animal.<br> They come everyday to share the dream.<br> You see?<br> Very stable.<br> - How long do they dream for?<br> - Three, four hours, each day.<br> - And the dream time?<br> - With this compound?<br> - About forty hours, each and every day.<br> - Why do they do it?<br> Tell him, Mr. Cobb.<br> After a while it becomes the<br> only way you can dream.<br> Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?<br> - They come here everyday to sleep?<br> - No.<br> They come to be woken up.<br> The dream has become their reality.<br> Who are you to say otherwise, huh?<br> Let's see what you can do.<br> You know how to find me.<br> You know what you have to do.<br> Sharp enough?<br> Are you alright, Mr. Cobb?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> I'm just fine.<br> Robert Fischer, heir to the<br> Fischer-Morrow energy conglomerate.<br> What's your problem<br> with this Mr. Fischer?<br> That's not your concern.<br> Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical<br> corporate espionage.<br> You asked me for inception. I do hope you<br> understand the gravity of that request.<br> The seed that we plant in this<br> man's mind will grow into an idea.<br> This idea will define him.<br> It may come to change...<br> It may come to change<br> everything about him.<br> We're the last company standing between<br> them and total energy dominance.<br> We can no longer compete.<br> Soon, they'll control the energy supply<br> of half the world.<br> In effect, they become a new superpower.<br> The world needs Robert Fischer<br> to change his mind.<br> That's where we come in.<br> How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?<br> Rumor is, the relationship<br> is quite complicated.<br> But we can't work based<br> solely on rumor, can't we?<br> Can you get me access to this man here?<br> Browning, Fischer Sr's right hand man.<br> Fischer Jr's godfather.<br> It should be possible.<br> If you can get the right references.<br> References are something<br> of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.<br> I'm not smelling settlement here.<br> Take them down.<br> Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's<br> policy is always one of avoiding litigation.<br> Shall we voice your<br> concerns with Maurice directly?<br> - Not sure if that's necessary.<br> - No, no, no. I think we should.<br> How is he?<br> I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily, but...<br> Robert, did I tell you to keep out of town...<br> Wait, just do it.<br> No, don't speak, Mr. Fischer.<br> Follow through!<br> Never.<br> Never gonna send what I asked.<br> Leave town.<br> Terrible.<br> Must be a cherish memory of his.<br> I put it beside his bed.<br> He hasn't even noticed.<br> Robert...we need to talk about the power of attorney.<br> - I know this is hard right now.<br> - Not now, Uncle Peter.<br> but it's imperative that we start to...<br> The vultures are circling.<br> The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,<br> the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.<br> I've had ample opportunity<br> to observe Browning...<br> adopt his physical presence,<br> study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.<br> Now, in the first layer of the dream,<br> I can impersonate Browning.<br> And suggest concepts to<br> Fischer's conscious mind.<br> Then, when we take<br> him a level deeper his own<br> projection of Browning should,<br> should feedback right back to him.<br> - So he gives himself the idea.<br> - Precisely.<br> That's the only way it will stick.<br> He has to see himself generate it.<br> Eames, I am impress.<br> Your confession, has always as<br> much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.<br> Were you going out there on your own?<br> No, no. I was just...<br> just running some experiments.<br> I didn't realize anyone was here.<br> So...<br> - Yeah, I was just, I was working on my totem actually.<br> - Here, let me take a look.<br> So you're learning, huh?<br> An elegant solution for<br> keeping track of reality.<br> - Was it your idea?<br> - No, it was...it's Mal's, actually.<br> This. This one was hers.<br> You spin it in a dream and it would never topple.<br> Just...spin and spin.<br> - Arthur told me she past away.<br> - How are the mazes coming on?<br> Each level relates to the part of<br> the subject's subconscious that...<br> we are trying to access.<br> So, making the bottom level, hospitals.<br> So Fischer will bring his father.<br> Actually I have a question<br> about this layout.<br> No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.<br> Only the dreamer should know the layout.<br> Why is that so important?<br> In case one of us brings in our projections<br> we don't want them knowing<br> the details of the maze.<br> You mean, in case you bring Mal in.<br> - Well, you can't keep her out, can you?<br> - Right.<br> You can't build because if you<br> know the maze then she knows it.<br> Which should sabotage the whole operation.<br> - Cobb, did the others know?<br> - No. No, they don't.<br> You gotta warn them<br> if this is getting worse.<br> No one said it's getting worse.<br> I need to get home.<br> That's all I care about right now.<br> - Why can't you go home?<br> - Because they think I killed her.<br> - Thank you.<br> - For what?<br> For not asking whether I did.<br> "I'll split up my father's empire."<br> Now, this is obviously an idea<br> that Robert himself will choose to reject.<br> That's why we need to plant<br> it deep in the subconscious.<br> Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right?<br> Not reason.<br> We need to find a way to translate<br> this into an emotional concept.<br> How do you translate a<br> business strategy to an emotion?<br> MAURICE AND ROBER TWO GENERATIONS OF FISCHER<br> TWO VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MANAGEMEN<br> That's what we're here to figure out, right?<br> Now, Robert's relationship with his<br> father is stressed, to say the least.<br> I can't remember that.<br> Because suggesting him to break up his<br> father's company is a "screw you" to the old man.<br> No, cause I think positive emotion...<br> triumphs negative emotion everytime.<br> We're all hearing for a reconciliation.<br> A catharsis.<br> We need Robert Fischer to have a<br> positive emotional reaction to all this.<br> Alright, well, try this.<br> "My father accepts that I want to create<br> for myself not follow in his footsteps."<br> That might work.<br> Might.<br> We're gonna need to do a little<br> better than might.<br> Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.<br> Forgive me for wanting a little specificity,<br> Eames.<br> - Specificity?<br> - Inception is not about being specific.<br> When we get inside his mind, we're gonna<br> have to work at what we find.<br> On the top level, we open up<br> his relationship with his father.<br> And seed...<br> "I will not follow in my father's footsteps".<br> And the next level down, we feed him with:<br> "I will create something for myself".<br> By the time we hit the bottom level,<br> we bring out the big guns.<br> - "My father doesn't want me to be him".<br> - Exactly.<br> With three layers down, the dreams are<br> gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.<br> Sedation.<br> For a sleep stable enough to<br> create three layers of dreaming<br> we have to combine with<br> an extremely powerful sedative.<br> Good night.<br> The compound that'll be<br> used to share the dream<br> creates avery clear<br> connection between dreamers<br> plus actually accelerating brain function.<br> In other words, it gives us<br> more time on each level.<br> Brain function in the dream<br> will be about twenty times normal.<br> When you enter a dream within that dream<br> the effect is compounded.<br> - It's three dreams, that's 10 hours, that's twenty...<br> - I'm sorry, math is never my strong subject.<br> - How much time is that?<br> - It's a week the first level down.<br> Six months the second level<br> and the third level...<br> Is ten years.<br> Who would wanna be stuck<br> in a dream for ten years?<br> Depends on the dream.<br> So once we've made the plants<br> how do we get out?<br> I'm hoping you have something more elegant<br> in mind than shooting me in the head.<br> - A kick.<br> - What's a kick?<br> This, Ariadne, would be a kick.<br> It's that feeling of falling,<br> you get the jolts, you awaken<br> snaps you out of the dream.<br> Are we gonna feel a kick<br> with this kind of sedation?<br> Oh, that's the counterpart.<br> I've customized it to leave<br> any ear function unimpaired.<br> That way, however deep the sleep,<br> the sleeper still feels falling.<br> Or tipping.<br> The trick is to synchronize a kick<br> that can penetrate all three levels.<br> We can use a musical content<br> to synchronize the different kicks.<br> He doesn't have any surgery scheduled,<br> No dental, nothing.<br> Wasn't he suppose to<br> have a knee operation?<br> Nothing. Nothing that will put him under for any REM.<br> We need...We need at least a good ten hours.<br> Sydney to Los Angeles.<br> One of the longest flights in the world.<br> He makes it every two weeks.<br> And he must be flying private.<br> Not if there were unexpected<br> maintenance with his plane.<br> - But that should be a 747.<br> - Why is that?<br> Cause in a 747 the pilot's up top<br> and the first class cabin is in the nose.<br> So no one would walk through.<br> But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin.<br> And the first class flight.<br> I bought the airline.<br> It seemed little.<br> Well, looks like we have our ten hours.<br> Ariadne?<br> Terrific work, by the way.<br> You know how to find me.<br> You know what you have to do.<br> Do you remember when<br> you ask me to marry you?<br> - Of course I do.<br> - You said you had a dream.<br> That will grow old together.<br> And we can.<br> You shouldn't be here.<br> I just want to see what kind of tests<br> you're doing here alone every night.<br> - Whatever it was, it has nothing to do with you.<br> - It has everything to do with me.<br> - You've asked me to share dreams with you.<br> - Not these. These are my dreams.<br> - Why do you do this to yourself?<br> - It's the only way I can still dream.<br> - Why is it so important to dream?<br> - In my dreams, we're still together.<br> These aren't just dreams.<br> These are memories and you<br> said never to use memories.<br> - I know I did.<br> - You're trying to keep her alive.<br> - You can't let her go.<br> - You don't understand.<br> These are moments that I regret<br> and memories that I have to change.<br> Oh, what's down there that you regret?<br> Listen, I do know one thing that you<br> need to understand about me.<br> - Is this your house?<br> - Mine and Mal's, yes.<br> - Where is she?<br> - She's already died.<br> That's my son, James. He's digging<br> for something, maybe a worm.<br> That's Phillipa.<br> You see, I thought about calling out to them so<br> they'd turn and smile and I can those<br> those beautiful faces of<br> theirs but...it's all too late.<br> Right now, or never, Cobb.<br> Then I start to panic. I realized I<br> don't want to regret this moment that...<br> I need to see their faces one last time.<br> James! Phillipa!<br> Come on in!<br> But the moment's passed.<br> And whatever I do,<br> I can't change this moment.<br> So I'm about to call out<br> to them and run away.<br> If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,<br> I've gotta get back home.<br> The real world.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - My name is...<br> I know who you are.<br> What are you doing here?<br> - I'm just trying to understand.<br> - How could you understand?<br> Do you know what it is to be a lover?<br> - To be half in a whole?<br> - No.<br> I'll tell you a riddle.<br> You're waiting for a train.<br> A train that will take you far away.<br> You know where you hope this train will take you.<br> But you don't know for sure.<br> But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter<br> to you where the train will take you?<br> Cause we will be together.<br> - How could you bring her here, Dom?<br> - What is this place?<br> This is the hotel suite where<br> we should spend our anniversary.<br> What happened here?<br> You promised!<br> You promised we'll be together!<br> Please, I need you stay here!<br> Just for now!<br> You said we'll be together!<br> You said we'll grow old together!<br> I'll come back for you.<br> Promise.<br> Do you think you can just build a<br> prison of memories to lock her in?<br> Do you really think that<br> that's gonna contain her?<br> It's time.<br> Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.<br> - When is the funeral?<br> - Thursday, in Los Angeles.<br> Robert should accompany the body<br> no later than Tuesday. We should move.<br> Right.<br> - Cobb, I'm coming with you.<br> - I promised Miles, no.<br> The team needs someone who<br> understands what you're struggling with.<br> And it doesn't have to be me.<br> But then you have to show<br> Arthur what I just saw.<br> Get us another seat on the plane.<br> If I get on this plane and you<br> don't honor our agreement.<br> When we land, I go to jail<br> for the rest of my life.<br> Complete the job on board.<br> I'll make one phone call from the plane.<br> You will have no trouble<br> getting through Immigration.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> - Thanks.<br> Yes.<br> - Third seat on the right.<br> - Thanks.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Oh yeah, I'm sorry, my bad.<br> - Welcome aboard, sir. May I take your coat?<br> - Thank you.<br> FASTEN SEAT BELTS.<br> NO SMOKING.<br> Excuse me, I think this is yours?<br> You must've dropped it.<br> - Gentlemen, can I have your drink?<br> - Oh, water please.<br> The same, please.<br> Thank you.<br> You know I couldn't help but notice<br> but you won't happen to be related to...<br> "The Maurice Fischer", would you?<br> - Yes, he...he was my father.<br> - Well he was a very inspiring figure.<br> - I'm sorry for your loss.<br> - Sir.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hey, to your father.<br> May he rest in peace, huh.<br> You couldn't have peed<br> before you went on there.<br> Sorry.<br> Pitching much free champagne<br> before take off, right, Yusuf?<br> Haha. Bloody hard.<br> Well now, he's gonna be<br> looking for a taxi in this weather.<br> - Asshole! Hey man, why don't you try...<br> - Walk away.<br> Look, I gotta go. Alright.<br> Taxi. Thank you.<br> Alright. Third and Market. Snappy.<br> What are you doing?<br> - Oh sorry, I thought it was free.<br> - Well, it's not.<br> - Maybe we could share.<br> - Maybe not.<br> Can you pull over and get this...<br> Great.<br> Come on!<br> There's $500 in there and<br> the wallet's worth more than that.<br> So you might as well<br> drop me at my stop.<br> I'm afraid that this...<br> Cover him!<br> No! No! No!<br> What was going on?<br> This wasn't in my design.<br> Cobb?<br> Cobb?<br> Get him!<br> - Are you alright?<br> - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.<br> Fischer's okay.<br> Unless he gets carsick.<br> Saito?<br> Get Fischer in the back room now!<br> - Get him the back room.!<br> - What the hell...<br> - Has he been shot? Is he dying?<br> - I don't know.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> - Where were you? What happened to you?<br> - The girl played a freight train.<br> Why did you put a train crossing<br> in the middle of a downtown interstate?<br> - I didn't.<br> - Where did it come from?<br> Let me ask you a question!<br> Why the hell were you ambushed?<br> Those were not normal projections!<br> They've been trained for God's sakes!<br> - You're right.<br> - How can they be trained?<br> Fischer had an extractor that<br> teaches subconscious to defend itself.<br> So his subconscious is militarized.<br> It should've shown in the research.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - So why the hell didn't it?<br> - Calm down.<br> Don't tell me to calm down.<br> This was your job, goddamn it!<br> This was your responsibility! You were meant to<br> check Fischer's background thoroughly!<br> We are not prepared for<br> this type of violence!<br> We have dealt with<br> self-security before!<br> We'll be a little more careful<br> and we're gonna be fine!<br> This was not a part of the plan!<br> He's dying for God's sake!<br> - Now, let's put him out of his misery.<br> - No, no!<br> - Don't do that!<br> - What's the matter, Cobb?<br> - Don't do that<br> - He's in agony, I'm waking him up.<br> - No, it won't wake him up.<br> - What do you mean, it won't wake him up?<br> - It won't wake him up.<br> - When we die in a dream, we wake up.<br> Not from this. We're too heavily<br> sedated to wake up that way.<br> - Right, so what happens when we die?<br> - We drop in a limbo.<br> - Are you serious?<br> - Limbo?<br> - Unconstructed dream space.<br> - What the hell is down there?<br> Just raw infinite subconscious.<br> Nothing is down there.<br> Except for whatever might have been left<br> behind by anyone sharing the dream<br> who has been trapped there before.<br> Which in our case, is just you.<br> How long can we be stuck there?<br> I can't even think about trying to<br> escape until the sedation is...<br> - How long, Yusuf?<br> - Decades, It could be infinite. I don't know.<br> Ask him he's the one who's been there.<br> Just get him upstairs.<br> Great.<br> Thank you.<br> So, now we're trapped in Fischer's<br> mind battling his own private army...<br> and if we get killed,<br> we'll be lost in limbo<br> till our brains turn<br> to scrambled egg, hmm?<br> You got first aid?<br> So you knew about this<br> risk and you didn't tell us?<br> There weren't meant to be any risk cause<br> I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.<br> - You had no right<br> - It was the only way to go three layers deep.<br> - And you, you knew about this and went along with it?<br> - I trusted him.<br> You trusted him. What?<br> Did he promise you half his share?<br> No. His whole share.<br> It's like he said, he'd done it before.<br> He'd done it before, what, with Mal?<br> Cause that worked so good?<br> It has nothing to do with it. I did what<br> I had to do to get back to my children.<br> So you lead us into a<br> war zone with no way out.<br> There is a way out. Alright, we continue on with<br> the job and we do this as fast as possible.<br> and we get out using the kick.<br> Just like before.<br> Forget it, If we go any deeper<br> we'll just raise the stakes.<br> I am sitting this one<br> out on this level, boys.<br> Fischer's security is surrounding<br> this place as we speak.<br> Ten hours of flight time<br> is a week at this level.<br> That means each and every one of<br> us will be killed. That I can guarantee.<br> We have no other choice but to<br> continue on and do it as fast as possible.<br> Downwards is the only way forward.<br> Get ready.<br> You, come on let's go shake him up.<br> I'm insured against kidnapping<br> for up to ten million.<br> - This should be very simple.<br> - Shut up! It won't be.<br> In your father's office, below the<br> bookshelf is his personal safe.<br> - We need the combination.<br> - I don't know any safe.<br> It doesn't mean you<br> don't know the combination.<br> - Tell us what it is.<br> - I don't know.<br> We have an old good<br> authority you do know.<br> Yeah? Who is this authority?<br> $500, this cost?<br> - What's inside?<br> - Cash cards, ID, and this.<br> - Useful?<br> - Maybe.<br> - You're on. We've got an hour.<br> - An hour?<br> I was supposed to<br> have all night to practice.<br> Saito wasn't supposed to<br> be shot in the chest.<br> We got one hour, now get<br> use something useful, please.<br> - What's that?<br> - Good authority.<br> Uncle Peter...<br> No, no.<br> - Just make him stop.<br> - The combination.<br> - I don't know it.<br> - Why does Browning say you do?<br> I don't know.<br> Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.<br> You have one hour.<br> Start talking.<br> Are you alright?<br> Are you okay?<br> Those bastards bad<br> at me for two days.<br> They have someone with access to your father's<br> office and they're trying to open his safe.<br> - Yeah.<br> - They said I'd know the combination. But I don't know it.<br> - Yeah, neither do I.<br> - What?<br> Maurice told me that when he past,<br> you were the only to be able to open it.<br> No, he never gave<br> me any combination.<br> Maybe he did, I mean, maybe you just<br> didn't know it was a combination.<br> Well, what then?<br> I don't know. Some meaningful<br> combination of numbers<br> based on your experiences with Maurice.<br> We didn't have very...<br> many meaningful experiences together.<br> Perhaps after your mother died.<br> After my mother died,<br> you know what he told me?<br> - "Robert, there's really nothing to be said".<br> - Oh well, he was bad with emotion.<br> I was eleven, Uncle Peter.<br> - How is he doing?<br> - He's in a lot of pain.<br> When we get down to the lower levels,<br> the pain will be less intense.<br> - And if he dies?<br> - Worst case scenario?<br> When he wakes up,<br> his mind is completely gone.<br> - Cobb, I will still honor the arrangement.<br> - I appreciate that, Saito.<br> But when you wake up you won't even<br> remember that we had an arrangement.<br> Limbo is gonna become your reality.<br> You're gonna be lost down there so long<br> that you're gonna become an old man.<br> - Filled with regret?<br> - Waiting to die alone.<br> No, I'll come back.<br> And we will be alive together again.<br> Breath.<br> These people are gonna kill us if<br> we don't give them the combination.<br> - They just want a ransom.<br> - I heard them.<br> They're gonna whack us in that van<br> and then drive it into the river.<br> - Alright. What is in the safe?<br> - Something for you.<br> Maurice always said it was<br> his most precious gift to you.<br> A will.<br> Maurice's Will is with Port and Dunn.<br> That's an alternate. This would<br> supercede the other if you wanted to.<br> It splits off the component<br> business of Fischer-Morrow<br> And it'd be the end of the<br> entire empire as we know it.<br> Destroy my whole inheritance.<br> Why would he suggest that, you think?<br> I just don't know.<br> He loved you, Robert.<br> - In his own way.<br> - In his own way?<br> At the end, he called<br> me into his deathbed<br> And he could barely speak.<br> But he took the trouble<br> to tell me one last thing.<br> He pulled me closer.<br> And I could only make out... one word.<br> "Disappointed".<br> When were you in limbo?<br> You might have the rest of the team<br> convinced to carry on with this job<br> but they don't know the truth.<br> Truth? What truth?<br> The truth that at any minute, you might<br> bring a freight train through the wall.<br> The truth that Mal is bursting<br> through your subconscious.<br> And the truth that as we go<br> deeper into Fischer<br> we're also going deeper into you.<br> And I...I'm not sure we're<br> gonna like what we find.<br> We were working together. We were exploring<br> the concept of a dream within a dream.<br> I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper<br> and deeper. I wanted to go further.<br> I just didn't understand the concept that<br> hours could turn into years down there.<br> That we could get trapped so deep.<br> That when we...<br> when wind up on the<br> shore of our subconscious<br> we lost side of what was real.<br> We created.<br> We built a world for ourselves.<br> We did that for years.<br> We built our own world.<br> - How long were you stuck there?<br> - Something like fifty years.<br> Jesus.<br> How could you stand it?<br> It wasn't so bad at first.<br> Feeling like gods.<br> The problem was that I knew<br> that none of that was real.<br> Eventually, it has became impossible<br> for me to live like that.<br> And what about for her?<br> She has locked something away.<br> Something deep inside her.<br> The truth that she once known.<br> She chose to forget.<br> Limbo became her reality.<br> What happened when you woke up?<br> Well, to wake up from that after,<br> after years, after decades...<br> to become old souls thrown<br> back into youth like that....<br> I knew something was wrong with her.<br> She just wouldn't admit it.<br> Eventually, she told me the truth.<br> She was possessed by an idea.<br> This one, very simple idea<br> that changed everything.<br> That our world wasn't real.<br> That she needed to wake up<br> to come back to reality, that...<br> in order to get back home...<br> We had to kill ourselves.<br> - What about your children?<br> - She thought they were projections.<br> That our real children are waiting<br> for us out there somewhere.<br> - Look, Cobb! I'm their mother.<br> - Calm down.<br> Can't you even tell the difference?<br> If this is my dream, why can't I control this?<br> Because you don't know you're dreaming!<br> She was certain there was nothing<br> I could do, no matter how much I begged...<br> no matter how much I pleaded.<br> She wanted to do it.<br> But she could not do it alone.<br> She loved me too much so...<br> She came up with a plan on our anniversary.<br> - Sweetheart, what are you doing?<br> - Join me.<br> Just step back inside, alright?<br> Just step back inside now, come on.<br> - No. I'm going to jump and you're coming with me.<br> - No, I'm not. But now, you listen to me.<br> If you jump, you're<br> not gonna wake up, remember?<br> You're gonna die. Now, just step back inside, come on.<br> Step back inside so we can talk about this.<br> We've talked enough.<br> - Mal.<br> - Come out unto the ledge or I'll jump right now.<br> Okay.<br> We're gonna talk about this.<br> Alright?<br> - I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.<br> - No, honey.<br> I can't. You know,<br> I can't do that.<br> Take a second and think<br> about our children.<br> Think about James.<br> Think about Phillipa, now.<br> If I go without you,<br> they'll take them away, anyway.<br> What does that mean?<br> I filed a letter with our attorney<br> explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.<br> How you threatened to kill me.<br> - Why did you do that?<br> - I love you, Dom.<br> Why did you..why...<br> why would you do this to me?<br> I've freed you from the guilt<br> of choosing to leave them.<br> We're going home.<br> To our real children.<br> No, no, no, no, Mal, You listen to me!<br> Alright? Mal, look at me, please.<br> You're waiting for a train.<br> - Mal,goddamn it! Don't do this!<br> - A train that will take you far away.<br> - James and Phillipa are waiting for you!<br> - You know where you hope this train will take you.<br> - They're waiting for us!<br> - But you can't know for sure.<br> - Mal, look at me!<br> - But it doesn't matter.<br> - Mal, goddamn it!<br> - Because you will be together.<br> Sweetheart, look at me!<br> Mal, no! Jesus Christ!<br> She had herself declared sane<br> by three different psychiatrists.<br> That made it impossible for me to try to<br> explain the nature of her madness.<br> So, I ran...<br> Right now, or never, Cobb.<br> Alright, let's go.<br> I left my children behind and I've been<br> trying to buy myself back ever since.<br> Your guilt defines her.<br> It's what powers her.<br> But you are not responsible for<br> the idea that destroyed her.<br> And if we are gonna succeed in this...<br> you have to forgive yourself.<br> You're gonna have to confront her.<br> But you don't have to do that alone.<br> - No, no, you don't...<br> - I'm doing it for the others.<br> Because they have no idea of the risk<br> they've taken coming down here with you.<br> We have to move.<br> - Time's up.<br> - Alright. I don't know any combination.<br> - Not consciously anyway.<br> - How about instinctively, huh?<br> I got somebody standing in<br> front of his office right now<br> ready to tap in the combination.<br> I need the first six numbers that<br> come to your head right now.<br> - I have no idea.<br> - Right now!<br> - I said right now! Right now!<br> - 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1.<br> You'd have to do better than that.<br> Alright. Gag him.<br> We're going for a ride.<br> What more do you like?<br> To kill me?<br> What did you get?<br> That boy's relationship with his father<br> is even worse than we imagined.<br> This helps us how?<br> The stronger the issues,<br> the more powerful the catharsis.<br> How are you gonna reconcile<br> then pursue his strengths?<br> - Well I'm working on that, don't I?<br> - Move fast.<br> Projections are closing in quick.<br> We gotta break out of here<br> before we're totally boxed in.<br> Damn it.<br> You mustn't be afraid to<br> dream a little bigger, darling.<br> Now, we need to shift his animosity<br> from his father to his godfather.<br> We're gonna destroy his<br> one positive relationship?<br> No, we'll repair his relationship with his father<br> by exposing his godfather's true nature.<br> We should thrice Fischer's<br> loot more than Saito's mission.<br> What about his security?<br> It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.<br> - No, I think we're going with Mr. Charles.<br> - No.<br> - Who's Mr. Charles?<br> - A bad ides.<br> The second we get into that<br> hotel and approach Fischer<br> his security will be all over us.<br> We run with Mr. Charles like we did on this timed job.<br> - So, you've done it before?<br> - Yeah, and it didn't worked.<br> The subject realized that he was dreaming<br> and his subconscious tore us to pieces.<br> Excellent.<br> But you've learned a lot, right?<br> I need some kind of distraction.<br> No problem. How about a<br> lovely lady that I've used before?<br> - Listen to me. You drive carefully, alright?<br> - Yeah.<br> getting down there is<br> gonna be unstable as hell.<br> Don't jump too soon. We only have one<br> shot at that kick you're gonna make.<br> I'll play the music and you'll know<br> it's coming, the rest is on you.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - Ready!<br> Sweet dreams.<br> Am I boring you?<br> I was telling you my story.<br> I guess it wasn't to your liking.<br> I have a lot in my mind.<br> There goes Mr. Charles.<br> Mr. Fischer, right?<br> Pleasure to see you again.<br> Rod Green from marketing.<br> - And you must be?<br> - Leaving.<br> In case you get bored.<br> She must have blown you off.<br> That is unless her phone<br> number really is only six digits.<br> 528-491<br> Funny way to make friends,<br> someone stealing their wallet like that.<br> Goddamn it.<br> The wallet alone is worth at least...<br> $500, right?<br> Listen, don't worry about it.<br> My people are already on it as we speak.<br> Who or what is Mr. Charles?<br> It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer<br> against his own subconscious.<br> And why don't you approve?<br> Cause it involves telling<br> the mark that he's dreaming`<br> which involves attracting<br> a lot of attention to us.<br> So Cobb said he couldn't do that?<br> So now you've noticed<br> how much time Cobb spends<br> doing things he says never to do.<br> Mr. Saito, may I have a moment?<br> - I'm sorry, but...<br> - Wait!<br> - You looked to be "livelier".<br> - Very amusing, Mr. Eames.<br> Turbulence on the plane?<br> No, I mean, it's must closer.<br> It's Yusuf's driving.<br> - I'm sorry, who did you say you were?<br> - Rod Green from marketing.<br> That's not true at all, is it?<br> My name is Mr. Charles.<br> You remember me, don't you?<br> I'm the head of your security down here.<br> Get out on a different floor and keep moving.<br> Dump the wallet.<br> The security will look for that.<br> - Okay.<br> - We need to buy Cobb a lot more time.<br> Security, huh?<br> - You work for the hotel?<br> - No, no.<br> I specialize in a very specific type of security.<br> Subconscious security.<br> Are you talking about dreams?<br> Are you talking about extraction?<br> I am here to protect you.<br> Look...<br> Excellent work.<br> Now, what is your plan?...<br> Mr. Fischer, I am here to<br> protect you in the event<br> that someone tries to access<br> your mind through your dreams.<br> You're not safe here.<br> They're coming for you.<br> Strange weather, isn't it?<br> You feel that?<br> What's happening?<br> Cobb is drawing Fischer's attention<br> to the strangeness of the dream<br> which is making his subconscious<br> look for the dreamer.<br> For me.<br> Quick, give me a kiss.<br> -They're still looking at us.<br> - Yeah, it's worth a shot.<br> We should probably get out of here.<br> Feel that? You've actually been<br> trained for this, Mr. Fischer.<br> Pay attention to the strangeness<br> of the weather, the shifting gravity.<br> None of this is real.<br> You're in a dream.<br> Now, the easiest for you to test yourself...<br> is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel.<br> Can you do that?<br> See, I don't, I...<br> Breath, breath.<br> Remember your training.<br> Accept the fact that you're in a dream<br> and I'm here to protect you.<br> Go on.<br> - You're not real?<br> - No, no.<br> I'm a projection of your subconscious.<br> I was sent here to protect you in the event<br> that extractors try to pull you into a dream.<br> And I believe that's what's<br> going on right now, Mr. Fischer.<br> Yeah. Okay. Okay.<br> - Can you get me out of here?<br> - Right away, follow me.<br> Stay there.<br> Jesus Christ! What are you doing?<br> These men were sent<br> here to abduct you, alright.<br> If you want my help,<br> you have to remain calm.<br> I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.<br> If this is a dream, I should just<br> kill myself to wake up, right?<br> I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.<br> I believe they have you sedated and if you<br> pull that trigger, you may not wake up.<br> You may go into a further dream state.<br> Now, you know what I'm talking about.<br> You remember the training.<br> Remember what I said to you.<br> Give me the gun.<br> This room should be directly below 528?<br> Yeah.<br> Think, Mr. Fischer, think<br> what do you remember from before this dream?<br> There was...there was a lot of gunfires.<br> And there's....rain.<br> Uncle Peter.<br> Oh my God, we've been kidnapped.<br> Where were they holding you?<br> - They had us in the back of a van.<br> - That explains the gravity shifts.<br> You're in the back of a van right now.<br> Keep going.<br> It had something to do with...<br> something to do with a safe?<br> God, why is it so hard to remember?<br> It's like trying to remember a<br> dream after you've woken up.<br> Listen, it takes years of practice.<br> You and Browning has<br> been pulled into this dream...<br> because they're trying to<br> steal something from your mind.<br> I need you to focus and try<br> and remember what that is.<br> What is it, Mr. Fischer?<br> Think!<br> A combination.<br> They demanded the first<br> numbers to pop into my head.<br> They're trying to extract the<br> number from your subconscious.<br> It can represent anything.<br> We're in a hotel right now.<br> We should try hotel rooms.<br> What was the number, Mr. Fischer?<br> Try and remember for me.<br> This is very important.<br> Five.<br> Five, two...<br> It was something.. it was a long number.<br> That's good enough.<br> We could start there.<br> - Fifth floor.<br> - Yup.<br> - So do you use a timer?<br> - No, I have to judge it for myself.<br> While you're all asleep in 528,<br> I'll wait for Yusuf's kick.<br> - Well, how will you know?<br> - His music warns me.<br> And then when the van hits the barrier<br> of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.<br> So we get a nice, synchronized kick.<br> If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.<br> If it's too late...<br> I won't be able to drop us.<br> Why not?<br> Cause of the van, that will be in free fall.<br> Can't drop you without gravity.<br> Right.<br> You're with me.<br> Go on.<br> - Mr. Charles<br> - Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?<br> - Yeah, I think so, yeah.<br> - They were trying to put you under.<br> - I'm already under.<br> - Under again.<br> What do you mean?<br> A dream within a dream?<br> Hey. I see you've changed.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I've mistaken you for a friend.<br> Good looking fella, I'm sure.<br> That's Fischer's projection of Browning.<br> Let's follow him and see how he behaves.<br> - Why?<br> - Because how he acts would tell us...<br> if Fischer is going to suspect his motives,<br> the way we wanted to.<br> - Uncle Peter.<br> - You said you were kidnapped together?<br> Well, not exactly. They already had him.<br> They were torturing him.<br> And you saw them torture him?<br> - The kidnappers are working for you?<br> - Robert.<br> You're trying to get that safe open?<br> So you get the alternate will?<br> Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life.<br> I can't let you destroy it.<br> I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.<br> Why would I?<br> I couldn't let you rise to<br> your father's last taunt.<br> - What taunt?<br> - The will, Robert, that will.<br> That's his last insult.<br> A challenge for you to<br> build something for yourself...<br> by telling you you're not<br> worthy of his accomplishments.<br> What, that he was disappointed, hmm?<br> I'm sorry.<br> But...he's wrong.<br> You can build a better<br> company than he ever did.<br> Mr. Fischer?<br> He's lying!<br> - How do you know?<br> - Trust me, it's what I do.<br> He's hiding something and<br> we need to find out what that is.<br> I need you to do the same thing to<br> him that he was going to do to you.<br> We'll enter his subconscious and find<br> out what he doesn't want you to know.<br> Alright.<br> He's out.<br> Wait, whose subconscious<br> are we going into exactly?<br> We're going into Fischer's.<br> But I told him it was Browning's<br> so he can be a part of our team.<br> He's gonna help us break<br> into his own subconscious.<br> That's right.<br> Security's gonna run you down, huh.<br> And I will lead them on a merry chase.<br> Just be back here for the kick.<br> Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.<br> Are you good?<br> - Are you alright?<br> - Yes, yes. I'm..I'm fine. I'm ready.<br> Cobb? Cobb?<br> What's down there?<br> Hopefully the truth we<br> want Fischer to learn.<br> I mean, what's down there for you?<br> Did you see that?<br> Eames, this is your dream.<br> I need you to draw the security away<br> from the complex, you understand?<br> - Who will guide Fischer in?<br> - Not me.<br> Find all the route,<br> everything could be compromised.<br> - I designed the place.<br> - No, you're with me.<br> I could do it.<br> Alright, you'll reach on the<br> route into the complex.<br> - Fischer, you'll be going with him.<br> - Alright.<br> - What about you?<br> - Keep this alive. I'll be listening in the whole time.<br> The windows on that upper<br> floor are big enough for me...<br> to cover you from that south tower.<br> You see it?<br> - Yeah. You're not coming in?<br> - In order to find out the truth...<br> about your father, you're gonna need to<br> break into Browning's mind on your own.<br> Come, Fischer!<br> Sound the alarm!<br> Sound the alarm!<br> Move!<br> Go!<br> So they're shooting me!<br> I hope they're ready.<br> It's too soon.<br> Cobb, do you hear that?<br> First heard it about twenty minutes ago.<br> I thought it was the wind up here.<br> Yeah, I hear it.<br> It's music.<br> - So what do we do?<br> - Move fast.<br> Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump.<br> Which gives Arthur three minutes.<br> Hey!<br> - Which gives us what?<br> - Sixty minutes.<br> Can they make that<br> route in under an hour?<br> They still have to climb<br> down to the middle terrace.<br> Well then, they need a new route.<br> A more direct route.<br> It's designed as a labyrinth.<br> There must be access where<br> we can cut through the maze, right?<br> Eames?<br> Did Eames add any features?<br> I don't think I should tell you.<br> If Mal finds out...<br> We don't have time for this.<br> Did he add any?<br> He added an air duct system<br> that can cut through the maze.<br> Good. Explain it to them.<br> - Saito?<br> - Go ahead.<br> Paradoxical.<br> - What was that?<br> - The kick.<br> - Cobb, did we miss it?<br> - Yeah, we missed it.<br> Couldn't you instead just have<br> dreamt of a goddamn beach?<br> What the hell do we do now?<br> We finish the job before the next kick.<br> - What next kick?<br> - When the van hits the water.<br> If wanna make a call,<br> please hang up and try again.<br> If you need assistance...<br> How do I drop you without gravity?<br> Arthur has a couple of minutes,<br> we have about twenty.<br> Are you okay?<br> Move out!<br> To the base!<br> There's something wrong. They're heading<br> your way like they know something.<br> Just buy us some more time, alright?<br> Come on!<br> On my way.<br> That's the antechamber,<br> it's just stronger.<br> Was it stronger if it have any windows?<br> No, I mean it wouldn't<br> be very strong if it did.<br> Let's hope Fischer likes<br> what he finds in there.<br> Are those projections part<br> of his subconscious?<br> Yes.<br> Are you destroying<br> those parts of his mind?<br> No, no.<br> They're just projections.<br> We're here.<br> You're clear but hurry.<br> There's an entire army headed your way.<br> We're in.<br> - There's someone else in there.<br> - Fischer, it's a trap, get out!<br> Come on. A little lower.<br> - Cobb. No, she is not real!<br> - How do you know that?<br> She is just a projection.<br> Fischer...Fischer is real!<br> Hello.<br> Eames!
