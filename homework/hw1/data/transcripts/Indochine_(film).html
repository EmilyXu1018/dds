                        I never left Indochina.<br> Camille's hand was ice cold in mine.<br> Her father and mother had just died.<br> They had been my dearest friends.<br> Their plane had crashed<br> into the ocean.<br> I had no children.<br> She had no parents.<br> The little princess of Annam<br> became my daughter.<br> I adopted her.<br> Prince N'Guyen, his wife and I<br> had been inseparable.<br> In our youth we thought...<br> the world consisted<br> of inseparable things...<br> men and women...<br> mountains and plains...<br> humans and gods...<br> Indochina and France.<br> By adopting Camille<br> I inherited her parents' land...<br> increasing the property<br> my father and I already owned.<br> The Lang-Sai rubber plantation...<br> became one of<br> Indochina's ten biggest.<br> That was my domain:<br> No!<br> Watch it!<br> Mama! We'll never get it right.<br> Is something upsetting you?<br> Tomorrow, send away<br> Mr. Emile's new girl.<br> Send Hoa away? Why?<br> Too greedy, too expensive,<br> bad girl...<br> mouth too big...<br> always wants more.<br> Today it's rice,<br> tomorrow it's pig...<br> after that it's butfalo.<br> Me know many girls<br> ready to replace her.<br> Very nice ones,<br> with smaller mouths.<br> No. This one you will keep.<br> Father has never telt better.<br> He's almost cheertul.<br> He might even smile soon.<br> You keep her.<br> Congaie is no good.<br> Love costs too much.<br> But he's happy.<br> He may never love again.<br> Does your father train them<br> a lot?<br> Every morning<br> for the past month.<br> Then they're too tired to work<br> on the plantation, but he's happy.<br> Rowing is exhausting.<br> Harder! Harder!<br> And in this heat!<br> Your men-- okay, I understand.<br> But mine?<br> Still, I hope my sailors beat them!<br> But, Admiral, it's my crew.<br> Eliane, we shouldn't give<br> these people ideas of victory.<br> I bet you 2,000 piastres.<br> Fine, but you'll lose.<br> Oh, stop it!<br> In your condition!<br> Some days you drive me crazy.<br> We haven't done it in a week.<br> And what do we do at nap time?<br> That's not really making love.<br> And be pregnant during monsoon season?<br> No thanks! Not me!<br> Time to go all out!<br> Madame Devries,<br> how awful for Mr. Emile!<br> All that training,<br> and then to lose. How awtul!<br> Like Raymond says, the Indo-Chinese<br> aren't built tor it. Eh, Raymond?<br> Calm down, Yvette.<br> They haven't lost yet.<br> We won!<br> Admiral, you owe me 2,000 piastres.<br> Who won? I saw nothing.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the race was won...<br> by the crew of Madame Eliane Devries.<br> Crew members...<br> Lui Van Min,<br> Phan Van Dong--<br> Coxswain: Mr. Emile Devries!<br> A statue of Joan of Arc,<br> in stucco...<br> of uncertain origin,<br> attributed to a student ot Bouscasse.<br> Bidding starts at 600 piastres.<br> Sorry I'm late, madame.<br> I almost bought a bedroom set,<br> but I only liked the bed.<br> Buy the bed.<br> Oh, no. The pieces<br> have always been together.<br> They shouldn't be separated.<br> They'll bring good luck<br> to whoever buys them.<br> You are poetic.<br> That's exactly it, Yvette.<br> You're a poetic person.<br> Is that what you came for?<br> Has everyone seen it?<br> Thank you, Mr. Gabriel.<br> Painted with great sensitivity.<br> Starting price, 300.<br> Three hundred.<br> - Four hundred.<br> - Four-twenty.<br> Four-fifty.<br> Four-sixty.<br> Five hundred.<br> Madame, please let me have<br> the painting.<br> They say you're rich.<br> I'm not.<br> I can't continue bidding,<br> but this landscape means a lot to me.<br> Sit down, sir.<br> What is your bid?<br> Well?<br> - Wait.<br> - Stop. I'll lend you the money.<br> Let go!<br> Tell me why you like it...<br> and it's yours.<br> That's enough.<br> Madame Devries, 500?<br> I sketched that landscape<br> dozens of times as a boy.<br> But I was never satisfied.<br> It needed...<br> that valley and hill<br> in partial shade.<br> They don't exist.<br> The artist invented them.<br> Me, I wouldn't have dared.<br> At age ten, one doesn't know<br> the world needs to be changed.<br> I need this painting.<br> I suffocate in Saigon<br> without the seashore.<br> I do not parade my feelings<br> before strangers, as you do.<br> Especially when something moves me.<br> All right.<br> The benefit of the doubt, then.<br> Sold!<br> Madame Devries is a collector.<br> Sold!<br> Mind your own business!<br> Me no trafficker.<br> Me never traffic opium.<br> French officer knows me.<br> My madame sick...<br> I go get medicine.<br> What is the time?<br> No boats in the delta after 8:00.<br> You know what to do.<br> Stop! That man's papers are in order!<br> You're crazy!<br> They didn't do anything!<br> In just one year,<br> they've drained you!<br> You're already glassy-eyed,<br> like someone lying in an opium den.<br> Soon this country will suck you dry.<br> They'll drown !<br> Are you proud of yourself?<br> I followed orders.<br> I leave indulgence<br> and generosity to you.<br> You're like my father.<br> He always said the same thing.<br> ''Let yourself go.<br> Follow your instincts.''<br> And he'd disappear<br> to pursue some passion.<br> He spread unhappiness<br> all around him.<br> I'll never be like that man.<br> Nobody'll steal what's in my head.<br> Not even eternal Asia!<br> Nobody!<br> You wanted to run away.<br> You're a deserter. You made me beat you.<br> You think mothers like<br> beating their children?<br> You're my mother and father.<br> Why are you here?<br> I'm lost.<br> I took a wrong turn.<br> Going where?<br> I'm looking for the occupants<br> of a sampan the navy sank last week.<br> I heard it happened near here.<br> So you're the one<br> going village to village.<br> You're wasting your time.<br> People here won't tell you a thing.<br> Would you know something?<br> Maybe.<br> He's called Liem.<br> Let him go.<br> You're scaring him.<br> His father's fine too.<br> He came to see me last night.<br> We talked very late.<br> I ordered the sampan sunk.<br> I thought the boy had drowned.<br> I even dreamt about it.<br> I kept seeing it.<br> Why did you do it?<br> I had to.<br> You were right.<br> There was opium aboard.<br> They're traffickers...<br> ot high-quality opium.<br> Bao, the man you sank,<br> is a well-known supplier.<br> His father was before him,<br> and his son will be after him.<br> If you repeat what I've said,<br> I'll deny it all.<br> Don't you mind<br> how they look at you?<br> Why should I?<br> They're my coolies.<br> They're also men.<br> I'm their boss, that's all.<br> Commanding men is a man's job.<br> Men usually say that.<br> What's wrong?<br> I'm regressing back to childhood.<br> I had to stay this way for hours.<br> My head would spin.<br> I'd start dreaming.<br> Here.<br> About what?<br> The admiral who defeated<br> the Turkish fleet at Lepante.<br> He was 23.<br> The hero ot all of Europe.<br> Don Juan ot Austria.<br> What did you dream about?<br> I wanted to be a boy.<br> And now?<br> I don't need to dream.<br> Everything I love is right here.<br> Wait.<br> Don't move.<br> I think it's stopped now.<br> Don't get lost this time.<br> The chief is back trom his trip.<br> What's his mood?<br> It's always good to see you.<br> A secret?<br> With all these people?<br> Luxury, mystery--<br> That's all it takes<br> to seduce a woman.<br> - You look tired.<br> - This time it's serious.<br> In Canton the oftensive is ready.<br> The communists and nationalists<br> have joined forces.<br> With Moscow's blessing.<br> To us!<br> Now you have no choice.<br> You'll need protection.<br> And marriage is<br> the best protection.<br> - They're looking.<br> - I don't care.<br> No, what?<br> About the marriage, no.<br> Very well. To friendship.<br> Mama...<br> Tanh will forget me in Paris<br> when he meets those French girls.<br> Honestly, how do I look?<br> - Pertect.<br> - You always say that.<br> Do all French girls<br> have light skin like you?<br> The difference between people<br> isn't skin color...<br> it's this.<br> It's this. The taste...<br> the fruit.<br> A child who only crunches apples...<br> can't be like me.<br> I'm an Asian.<br> A mango.<br> - When will Tanh return?<br> - Not until next year.<br> Paris still fascinates him?<br> He asks whether I love him.<br> Well?<br> What's it like to love someone?<br> When it happens, you'll know.<br> I wanted to protect Camille.<br> She knew nothing about my life,<br> the men I'd met...<br> or those I'd loved.<br> I had had casual affairs...<br> the kind that leave no trace.<br> Jean-Baptiste met me at the house<br> where I grew up, near Saigon.<br> My father never wanted to sell it.<br> It contained his whole life<br> and all my childhood memories.<br> While waiting for you, I thought...<br> ''He won't be here at 4:00.<br> He'll be a little late.''<br> So I thought I'd quickly tidy up...<br> close the house and leave.<br> As it nothing had happened.<br> Our first meeting...<br> our rendezvous here, all erased.<br> Jean-Baptiste--<br> There's still time to keep<br> our story from beginning.<br> I should have fled.<br> But nothing existed but him.<br> I know he loved me too.<br> Prepare him the opium.<br> Good day, sir.<br> Eliane's not here.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Thursday she's at the bank.<br> She'd brought no one here<br> in years.<br> I'm going to tell you a story.<br> I'm not interested.<br> Oh, no, you don't!<br> You're in my house!<br> Now listen !<br> Father was so afraid of losing me.<br> He was capable of anything then.<br> Old Tchung told me one day...<br> that Father had offered<br> Jean-Baptiste money.<br> How much?<br> How much is your daughter worth?<br> Go ahead. Humiliate me, pay me!<br> Name a price.<br> Give me a figure!<br> I saw how the steward, the coolies, the<br> bankers were all at her beck and call!<br> So it'll cost you!<br> It I leave her to you,<br> Say it! I want to hear it!<br> Yes. 500,000.<br> No, sir.<br> Such things don't have a price.<br> You have your life ahead of you.<br> She and I don't. Leave her!<br> Jean-Baptiste?<br> Mister ofticer gone.<br> When will he be back?<br> Me not know.<br> ''Flee, jealousy, tortures--<br> Wherever you are,<br> your soul will embrace mine.''<br> Now, lovely archangel,<br> it's your turn.<br> Stop it.<br> I'm trying my luck.<br> An apparition !<br> You, here?<br> I've looked everywhere for you.<br> Talk to me, Jean-Baptiste, talk.<br> There will always be hours,<br> days and weeks to myself.<br> All to myself.<br> Understand?<br> The same goes for you.<br> We're two people.<br> I need you.<br> You're part of my life now.<br> I need your voice...<br> your tenderness, your hands--<br> Protect me.<br> You must protect me.<br> Stop it.<br> This pleading woman isn't you.<br> I want the world,<br> not a little corner like a tomb.<br> I want to discover the world.<br> Are you upset, madame?<br> No. Why?<br> Because you're crying.<br> Go away.<br> Go away. You're crazy!<br> Forgive me.<br> Jean-Baptiste!<br> Stop!<br> Stop!<br> Get out.<br> Satait, please leave.<br> Life continues as before.<br> The sound of footsteps<br> on dead leaves...<br> sap oozing from<br> the wounded trees...<br> and above all, what I loved most<br> and others didn't--<br> the smell of rubber.<br> I didn't believe it.<br> I'm so used to Guy's jokes.<br> - You arrived when?<br> - Two days ago.<br> You'll be staying?<br> Tanh was expelled from France.<br> What? What did you say?<br> He's been expelled. Positively.<br> But why?<br> She knows about Yen-Bay?<br> It's her country.<br> She's entitled to know.<br> Three months ago,<br> Indo-Chinese troops...<br> massacred their French otficers.<br> So we executed the assassins.<br> End of story.<br> Not at all! In Paris, supporters<br> ot the assassins demonstrated.<br> The demonstrators were jailed.<br> End of story.<br> Not at all.<br> It triggered solidarity movements.<br> They marched up the Elysee!<br> And Tanh was among them.<br> So they kicked him out.<br> And now?<br> Now it is over, Camille.<br> I was bad. I was punished.<br> On the boat coming back...<br> I thought about<br> our childhood here.<br> Soon this land<br> will be ours again.<br> I know my son.<br> Youthful tollies,<br> bad influences in Paris--<br> - I know how to straighten him out.<br> - Money?<br> He'll be an oil and soap merchant,<br> like me.<br> He'll be very rich.<br> Richer than the French engineers.<br> I was against<br> his studying in France.<br> But you and your friend Guy<br> kept insisting.<br> Young people like Tanh<br> are this country's tuture.<br> An Indo-Chinese elite<br> should be created.<br> We are the elite,<br> because we are rich.<br> Tanh is an intellectual.<br> Business wouldn't interest him.<br> He should stop dreaming.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - I've cried a lot.<br> My buffalo died<br> and my boy is sick.<br> The boy took the remedy?<br> Yes, but he's hungry<br> and I need money.<br> You'd gamble with money.<br> Send me your wite.<br> I'll give her the sack of rice<br> and the medicine.<br> You will get nothing.<br> Some champagne?<br> No thanks, Aunt.<br> Camille's mother was my cousin.<br> We always wished for<br> a marriage between our children.<br> When you adopted Camille...<br> that was my only condition.<br> The ties must not be broken.<br> Now she's my daughter<br> and I want her to be happy.<br> Two boys--<br> They'll give us two boys.<br> We'll be happy in our old age.<br> The older one<br> will marry a rich girl...<br> and our children<br> will care for us.<br> And when our time comes,<br> we'll die contentedly...<br> surrounded by our children<br> and grandchildren.<br> I hadn't seen Jean-Baptiste again,<br> but I hadn't forgotten him.<br> What did people know<br> about our story?<br> Certainly not my distress.<br> I hid my feelings so well.<br> And then we lived in peace,<br> under an illusion.<br> The thunderbolt shattered<br> the "Day of Tranquility. "<br> My father and I were the only Europeans<br> invited by the mandarins.<br> They killed the mandarin !<br> It's the communists!<br> They'll kill us all!<br> Run!<br> Madame Devries, Mr. Emile!<br> Come quickly!<br> The fire was no accident!<br> All the rubber has burned up.<br> When can the work start again?<br> The vats need cleaning.<br> - Maybe tomorrow.<br> - Why not now?<br> - They're afraid they'll get shot.<br> - By whom?<br> Boom!

It<br> resembled a place he'd dreamt about.<br> So, he designed it.<br> He had trees and flowers planted...<br> in gentle, continuous lines.<br> Not a single broken line.<br> Once it looked exactly<br> like in his dream...<br> he said...<br> ''I can die.''<br> I also dream of a harmonious place,<br> but to live in.<br> That place exists, Camille.<br> It's yours.<br> The domain is yours.<br> Soon you'll be my daughter.<br> She was so gentle,<br> so calm...<br> as if she had<br> accepted her fate...<br> to marry the man<br> chosen for her.<br> Actually, she had secretly<br> decided her future.<br> That's why she looked<br> so beautiful.<br> Tell them we know<br> what we're doing.<br> I loved her more than anything...<br> and I had never told her.<br> She was leaving for good.<br> She had decided<br> to join Jean-Baptiste.<br> She had chosen...<br> and I hadn't wanted to see it,<br> hadn't wanted to understand...<br> that she loved...<br> as one loves the first time.<br> Nothing would stop her.<br> Continue.<br> They didn't arrest her<br> at the Hanoi station.<br> She knew they'd be<br> waiting for her.<br> I remembered her father's phrase...<br> "In Asia one doesn't die.
