                        [DISTANT RUMBLING]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [MEN SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> While I'm very familiar<br> with you and your family,<br> I have no way of knowing if<br> you are familiar with who I am.<br> Are you aware<br> of my existence?<br> Yes.<br> This is good.<br> Now, are you aware of the job I've<br> been ordered to carry out in France?<br> Yes.<br> Please tell me<br> what you've heard.<br> I've heard<br> that the Fhrer has put you in charge<br> of rounding up the Jews left in France<br> who are either hiding<br> or passing for Gentile.<br> The Fhrer couldn't have<br> said it better himself.<br> But the meaning<br> of your visit,<br> pleasant though it is,<br> is mysterious to me.<br> The Germans looked through my house<br> nine months ago for hiding Jews<br> and found nothing.<br> I'm aware of that.<br> I've read the reports<br> of this area.<br> But like any enterprise,<br> when under new management,<br> there is always a slight<br> duplication of efforts,<br> most of it being a complete waste of<br> time, but needs to be done nevertheless.<br> I just have a few questions,<br> monsieur LaPadite.<br> If you can assist me<br> with answers,<br> my department can close<br> the file on your family.<br> Now,<br> before the occupation, there were<br> four Jewish families in this area,<br> all dairy farmers<br> like yourself.<br> Doleracs, Rollins,<br> the Loveitts<br> and the Dreyfuses.<br> Is that correct?<br> To my knowledge,<br> those were the Jewish families<br> among the dairy farmers.<br> Herr Colonel, would it disturb<br> you if I smoked my pipe?<br> [CHUCKLES] Please,<br> monsieur LaPadite,<br> this is your house,<br> make yourself comfortable.<br> Now, according<br> to these papers,<br> all the Jewish families in this<br> area have been accounted for<br> except the Dreyfuses.<br> Somewhere in the last year it<br> would appear they've vanished.<br> Which leads me to the conclusion that<br> they've either made good their escape<br> or someone is very<br> successfully hiding them.<br> What have you heard about the<br> Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?<br> Only rumors.<br> I love rumors!<br> Facts could be<br> so misleading,<br> where rumors, true or<br> false, are often revealing.<br> So, monsieur LaPadite,<br> what rumors have you heard<br> regarding the Dreyfuses?<br> [CLEARS THROAT]<br> Again,<br> this is just a rumor,<br> but we heard the Dreyfuses<br> had made their way into Spain.<br> [MATCHSTICKS SCRAPING]<br> So, the rumors you've heard<br> have been of escape?<br> [AGREES IN FRENCH]<br> Yes.<br> Having never met the Dreyfuses,<br> would you confirm for me<br> the exact members of the<br> household and their names?<br> [CLEARS THROAT]<br> There were<br> five of them.<br> The father, Jacob.<br> Wife, Miram.<br> And her brother, Bob.<br> How old is Bob?<br> Thirty, 31.<br> Continue.<br> And the children,<br> Amos<br> and Shosanna.<br> Ages of the children?<br> [SIGHS]<br> Amos was nine or 10.<br> And Shosanna?<br> And Shosanna was<br> I'm not really sure.<br> Well, I guess<br> that should do it.<br> [ZIPPER CLOSING]<br> However, before I go, could I have<br> another glass of your delicious milk?<br> But of course.<br> Monsieur LaPadite,<br> are you aware of the nickname the<br> people of France have given me?<br> [SIGHS]<br> I have no interest<br> in such things.<br> But you are aware<br> of what they call me.<br> I'm aware.<br> What are you aware of?<br> [THANKING IN FRENCH]<br> That they call you<br> "The Jew Hunter."<br> Precisely.<br> I understand your<br> trepidation in repeating it.<br> Heydrich apparently<br> hates the moniker<br> the good people of Prague<br> have bestowed on him.<br> Actually, why he would hate the<br> name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.<br> It would appear he has done<br> everything in his power to earn it.<br> Now I, on the other hand,<br> love my unofficial title<br> precisely because<br> I've earned it.<br> The feature that makes me such an<br> effective hunter of the Jews is,<br> as opposed to most<br> German soldiers,<br> I can think like a Jew<br> where they can only<br> think like a German.<br> [CHUCKLING] More precisely,<br> a German soldier.<br> Now, if one were to determine what attribute<br> the German people share with a beast,<br> it would be the cunning and the<br> predatory instinct of a hawk.<br> But if one were to determine what<br> attributes the Jews share with a beast,<br> it would be<br> that of the rat.<br> The Fhrer and Goebbels' propaganda<br> have said pretty much the same thing.<br> But where our conclusions<br> differ,<br> is I don't consider<br> the comparison an insult.<br> Consider for a moment<br> the world a rat lives in.<br> It's a hostile world,<br> indeed.<br> If a rat were to scamper through<br> your front door, right now,<br> would you greet it<br> with hostility?<br> I suppose I would.<br> Has a rat ever done<br> anything to you<br> to create this animosity<br> you feel toward them?<br> Rats spread disease.<br> They bite people.<br> Rats were the cause of the bubonic<br> plague, but that's some time ago.<br> I propose to you any disease<br> a rat could spread,<br> a squirrel could<br> equally carry.<br> Would you agree?<br> [AGREES IN FRENCH]<br> Yet, I assume you don't share<br> the same animosity with squirrels<br> that you do with rats,<br> do you?<br> No.<br> Yet, they're both rodents,<br> are they not?<br> And except for the tail, they<br> even rather look alike, don't they?<br> It's an interesting thought,<br> Herr Colonel.<br> However interesting<br> as the thought may be,<br> it makes not one bit of<br> difference to how you feel.<br> If a rat were to walk in<br> here, right now, as I'm talking<br> would you greet it with a<br> saucer of your delicious milk?<br> Probably not.<br> I didn't think so.<br> You don't like them.<br> You don't really know<br> why you don't like them.<br> All you know is<br> you find them repulsive.<br> Consequently, a German<br> soldier conducts a search<br> of a house suspected<br> of hiding Jews.<br> Where does the hawk look?<br> He looks in the barn, he looks in<br> the attic, he looks in the cellar,<br> he looks everywhere<br> he would hide.<br> But there are so many places it<br> would never occur to a hawk to hide.<br> However, the reason the Fhrer has<br> brought me off my Alps in Austria<br> and placed me in French cow country<br> today is because it does occur to me.<br> Because I'm aware what tremendous<br> feats human beings are capable of<br> once they abandon dignity.<br> May I smoke my pipe<br> as well?<br> Please, Herr Colonel,<br> make yourself at home.<br> Now, my job dictates<br> that I must have my men<br> enter your home<br> and conduct<br> a thorough search<br> before I can officially cross<br> your family's name off my list.<br> And if there are any irregularities<br> to be found, rest assured they will be.<br> That is unless you have<br> something to tell me<br> that makes the conducting<br> of a search unnecessary.<br> I might add, also,<br> that any information<br> that makes the performance of my duty<br> easier will not be met with punishment.<br> Actually, quite the contrary.<br> It will be met with reward.<br> And that reward will be,<br> your family will cease<br> to be harassed in any way<br> by the German military during the<br> rest of our occupation of your country.<br> You're sheltering enemies<br> of the state, are you not?<br> Yes.<br> You're sheltering them underneath<br> your floorboards, aren't you?<br> Yes.<br> Point out to me the areas<br> where they're hiding.<br> Since I haven't heard<br> any disturbance,<br> I assume, while they're listening,<br> they don't speak English.<br> Yes.<br> I'm going to switch back to French now,<br> and I want you to follow my masquerade.<br> Is that clear?<br> [SNIFFLES]<br> Yes.<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [SHUSHING]<br> It's the girl.<br> [SOBBING]<br> [EXCLAIMS]<br> [PANTING]<br> Au revoir, Shosanna!<br> [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]<br> ALDO: Ten-hut!<br> My name is<br> Lieutenant Aldo Raine.<br> And I'm putting together a special<br> team, and I need me eight soldiers.<br> Eight Jewish<br> American soldiers.<br> Now, you all might've heard rumors<br> about the armada happening soon.<br> Well, we'll be leaving<br> a little earlier.<br> We're going to be dropped into<br> France dressed as civilians.<br> Once we're<br> in enemy territory,<br> as a bushwhacking<br> guerrilla army,<br> we're going to be doing one<br> thing and one thing only.<br> Killing Nazis.<br> I don't know<br> about you all,<br> but I sure as hell didn't come down<br> from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,<br> cross 5, 000 miles of water,<br> fight my way through half of Sicily<br> and jump out of a fucking airplane to<br> teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.<br> Nazi ain't got no humanity.<br> They're the foot soldiers of a<br> Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac<br> and they need<br> to be destroyed.<br> That's why any and every son of a<br> bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,<br> they're going to die.<br> Now, I'm the direct descendent<br> of the mountain man Jim Bridger.<br> That means I got<br> a little Indian in me.<br> And our battle plan will be<br> that of an Apache resistance.<br> We will be cruel<br> to the Germans.<br> And through our cruelty,<br> they will know who we are.<br> And they will find<br> the evidence of our cruelty<br> in the disemboweled,<br> dismembered<br> and disfigured bodies of their<br> brothers we leave behind us.<br> And the German won't be able<br> to help themselves<br> but imagine the cruelty their<br> brothers endured at our hands,<br> and our boot heels<br> and the edge of our knives.<br> And the German<br> will be sickened by us.<br> And the German<br> will talk about us.<br> And the German<br> will fear us.<br> And when the German<br> closes their eyes at night<br> and they're tortured by their<br> subconscious for the evil they have done,<br> it will be with thoughts of us<br> that they are tortured with.<br> Sound good?<br> ALL: Yes, sir!<br> That's what I like to hear.<br> But I got a word of warning<br> for all you would-be warriors.<br> When you join my command,<br> you take on debit.<br> A debit you owe me,<br> personally.<br> Each and every man under my<br> command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.<br> And I want my scalps.<br> And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps<br> taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.<br> Or you will die trying!<br> [SHOUTING IN GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [INTERCOM BUZZING]<br> [KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN ON INTERCOM]<br> [KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [BASTERDS LAUGHING]<br> Hey, Hirschberg.<br> Send that Kraut<br> sarge over.<br> HIRSCHBERG: You. Go.<br> Sergeant<br> Werner Rachtman.<br> Lieutenant Aldo Raine.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> You know what<br> "sit down" means, Werner?<br> Yes.<br> Then sit down.<br> How is your English,<br> Werner?<br> Because if need be, we got a<br> couple of fellows who can translate.<br> Wicki here,<br> an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out<br> of Munich while the getting was good.<br> Became American, got drafted,<br> come back to give y'all what for.<br> Another one up there<br> you might be familiar with.<br> Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.<br> Heard of him?<br> Everybody in the German Army<br> has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.<br> [BASTERDS LAUGHING]<br> MALE NARRATOR: The reason<br> for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity<br> among German soldiers<br> is simple.<br> As a German-enlisted man,<br> he killed 13 Gestapo officers.<br> Instead of putting him up<br> against a wall,<br> the High Command decided<br> to send him back to Berlin<br> to be made an example of.<br> Needless to say, once the<br> Basterds heard about him,<br> he never got there.<br> [GASPING]<br> Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?<br> Lieutenant Aldo Raine.<br> These are the Basterds.<br> Ever heard of us?<br> We just want to say we're<br> a big fan of your work.<br> When it comes<br> to killing Nazis...<br> [MAN GROANING]<br> ...I think you show<br> great talent.<br> And I pride myself for having<br> an eye for that kind of talent.<br> But your status as a Nazi<br> killer is still amateur.<br> We all come here to see<br> if you want to go pro.<br> [BASTERDS LAUGHING]<br> Can I assume<br> you know who we are?<br> You're Aldo the Apache.<br> [BASTERDS WHOOPING]<br> Werner,<br> if you heard of us,<br> you probably heard we ain't in<br> the prisoner-taking business.<br> We in the killing Nazi business,<br> and, cousin, business is a-booming.<br> HIRSCHBERG:<br> [LAUGHING] Oh, yeah.<br> Now, that leaves two ways<br> we can play this out.<br> Either kill you<br> or let you go.<br> Whether or not you're going<br> to leave this ditch alive<br> depends entirely on you.<br> Up the road a piece,<br> there's an orchard.<br> Besides you, we know there's another<br> Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.<br> If that patrol were<br> to have any crack shots,<br> that orchard would be<br> a goddamn sniper's delight.<br> So if you ever want to eat<br> a sauerkraut sandwich again,<br> you got to show me on<br> this here map where they are.<br> You got to tell me how many<br> they are, and you got to tell me<br> what kind of artillery<br> they're carrying with them.<br> [SCOFFING]<br> You can't expect me to divulge information<br> that would put German lives in danger.<br> Well, now, Werner, that's where you're<br> wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.<br> I need to know about<br> Germans hiding in trees.<br> And you need to tell me. And<br> you need to tell me right now.<br> Now, just take that<br> finger of yours<br> and point out on this here map<br> where this party is being held,<br> how many is coming and what<br> they brought to play with.<br> I respectfully refuse,<br> sir.<br> [BATTAPPING]<br> Hear that?<br> Yes.<br> That's Sergeant<br> Donny Donowitz.<br> You might know him better<br> by his nickname.<br> The Bear Jew.<br> Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,<br> you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.<br> I heard of The Bear Jew.<br> What did you hear?<br> Beats German soldiers<br> with a club.<br> He bashes their brains in with<br> a baseball bat, what he does.<br> And, Werner, I'm going to<br> ask you one last goddamn time,<br> and if you still<br> respectfully refuse,<br> I'm calling<br> The Bear Jew over.<br> He's going to take<br> that big bat of his,<br> and he's going to beat<br> your ass to death with it.<br> Now, take your<br> Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,<br> and point out on this map<br> what I want to know.<br> Fuck you.<br> And your Jew dogs.<br> [BASTERDS LAUGHING]<br> [BASTERDS APPLAUDING]<br> Actually, Werner, we're all<br> tickled to hear you say that.<br> Quite frankly, watching<br> Donny beat Nazis to death<br> is the closest we ever get<br> to going to the movies.

Straight.<br> No junk in it.<br> It says here that<br> you speak German fluently.<br> Like a Katzenjammer Kid.<br> And your occupation<br> before the war?<br> I'm a film critic.<br> List your accomplishments.<br> Well, sir,<br> such as they are,<br> I write reviews and articles for a<br> publication called Films and Filmmakers,<br> and I've had<br> two books published.<br> Impressive. Don't be modest,<br> Lieutenant. What are their titles?<br> The first book<br> was called<br> Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:<br> A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.<br> And the second one was called<br> Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.<br> It's a subtextual film criticism study<br> of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.<br> What should we<br> drink to, sir?<br> Well...<br> Down with Hitler.<br> All the way down, sir.<br> Yes.<br> Are you familiar with German<br> cinema under the Third Reich?<br> Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of<br> the films made in the last three years,<br> but I'm familiar with it.<br> Explain it to me.<br> Pardon, sir?<br> Well, this little escapade of ours requires<br> a knowledge of the German film industry<br> under the Third Reich. Explain<br> to me UFA under Goebbels.<br> Goebbels considers<br> the films he's making<br> to be the beginning of a<br> new era in German cinema.<br> An alternative<br> to what he considers<br> the Jewish-German intellectual<br> cinema of the '20s,<br> and the Jewish-controlled<br> dogma of Hollywood.<br> How's he doing?<br> Frightfully sorry, sir.<br> Once again?<br> You say he wants to take on<br> the Jews at their own game.<br> Well, compared to,<br> say, Louis B. Mayer,<br> how's he doing?<br> Quite well, actually.<br> Since Goebbels<br> has taken over,<br> film attendance has steadily risen<br> in Germany over the last eight years.<br> But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be<br> Goebbels' proper opposite number.<br> I believe Goebbels sees himself<br> closer to David O. Selznick.<br> Brief him.<br> Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time<br> I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.<br> Three days from now<br> Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala<br> premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.<br> What film, sir?<br> The motion picture is<br> called Nation's Pride.<br> In attendance at this<br> joyous Germatic occasion<br> will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,<br> and most of the German High Command<br> including all high ranking officers<br> of both the SS and the Gestapo,<br> as well as luminaries of the<br> Nazi propaganda film industry.<br> The master race at play?<br> Basically, we have all our<br> rotten eggs in one basket.<br> The objective<br> of Operation Kino,<br> blow up the basket.<br> And like the snows of<br> yesteryear, gone from this earth.<br> Jolly good, sir.<br> An American Secret Service outfit<br> that lives deep behind enemy lines<br> will be your assist.<br> The Germans call them<br> the Basterds.<br> The Basterds.<br> Never heard of them.<br> Whole point of the Secret Service,<br> old boy, you not hearing of them.<br> But the Jerries have heard of them, because<br> these Yanks have been them the devil.<br> You'll be dropped into France,<br> about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.<br> The Basterds<br> will be waiting for you.<br> First thing, you'll go to a<br> little village called Nadine.<br> In Nadine, there's a<br> tavern called La Louisiane.<br> There you'll rendezvous with our<br> double agent. She'll take it from there.<br> She's the one who is going<br> to get you into the premiere.<br> It'll be you, her, and two<br> German-born members of the Basterds.<br> She's also made all the other<br> arrangements you're going to need.<br> How will I know her?<br> I suspect that won't be<br> too much trouble for you.<br> Your contact<br> is Bridget von Hammersmark.<br> Bridget von Hammersmark?<br> [CHUCKLING] The German movie<br> star is working for England?<br> Yes, for the last<br> two years now.<br> One could even say that<br> Operation Kino was her brainchild.<br> Indeed.<br> Got the gist?<br> I think so, sir.<br> Paris when it sizzles.<br> You didn't say the goddamn<br> rendezvous is in a fucking basement.<br> I didn't know.<br> You said it was<br> in a tavern.<br> It is a tavern.<br> Yeah, in a basement.<br> You know, fighting in a basement<br> offers a lot of difficulties.<br> Number one being, you're<br> fighting in a basement.<br> What if we go in there<br> and she's not even there?<br> We wait.<br> Don't worry. She's a British<br> spy. She'll make the rendezvous.<br> Stiglitz, right?<br> That's right, sir.<br> I hear you're pretty good<br> with that.<br> You know, we're not looking<br> for trouble right now.<br> Simply making contact with our<br> agent. Should be uneventful.<br> However, the off chance I'm<br> wrong, things prove eventful,<br> I need to know<br> we can all remain calm.<br> I don't look calm to you?<br> [LAUGHS]<br> Well, now that you put it<br> like that, I guess you do.<br> This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not<br> exactly the loquacious type, is he?<br> Is that the kind of man<br> you need? Loquacious type?<br> Fair point, Lieutenant.<br> So you all get in trouble in<br> there, what are we supposed to do?<br> Make bets<br> on how it all comes out?<br> If we get into trouble,<br> we can handle it.<br> But if trouble does happen,<br> we need you to make damn sure<br> no Germans, or French, for that<br> matter, escape from that basement.<br> If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is<br> compromised, the mission is kaput.<br> Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose<br> idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?<br> She chose the spot.<br> Isn't that just dandy?<br> Look, she's not a military<br> strategist. She's just an actress.<br> You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to<br> know you don't want to fight in a basement.<br> She wasn't picking<br> a place to fight.<br> She was picking a place<br> isolated and without Germans.<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [ORDERING IN GERMAN AND FRENCH]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [ALL LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [MAN LAUGHING]<br> [FEMALE SERGEANT SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [GLASS SHATTERING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH AND GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [PEOPLE LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN<br> SOFTLY]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [CORK POPPING]<br> Mmm.<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [ALL CHEERING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [ALL LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [ALL TOASTING IN GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [STAMMERING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [THANKING IN GERMAN]<br> [EXHALING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [PHONOGRAPH CRACKLING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [ALL LAUGHING]<br> [BOTH LAUGHING]<br> [CHUCKLING]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [SIGHS]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [HUMMING EXOTIC MELODY]<br> [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]<br> [WHIP CRACKING]<br> [GRUNTS]<br> [VON HAMMERSMARK LAUGHING]<br> [VON HAMMERSMARK AND HICOX<br> SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [EXHALES]<br> [ERIC SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [EXCLAIMS]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> Well, if this is it,<br> old boy,<br> I hope you don't mind if I<br> go out speaking the King's.<br> By all means,<br> Captain.<br> There's a special rung in hell reserved<br> for people who waste good Scotch.<br> Seeing as I may be rapping<br> on the door momentarily,<br> I must say,<br> damn good stuff, sir.<br> Now, about this pickle<br> we find ourselves in.<br> It would appear there's only<br> one thing left for you to do.<br> And what would that be?<br> Stiglitz.<br> Say auf Wiedersehen<br> to your Nazi balls.<br> [SCREAMING]<br> [PANTING]<br> [DOOR OPENING]<br> [GUN COCKING]<br> You outside.<br> Who are you?<br> British?

Make a deal.<br> Over there is a very capable<br> two-way radio and sitting behind it<br> is a more than capable<br> radio operator named Hermann.<br> Get me someone on the<br> other end of that radio<br> with the power of the pen<br> to authorize my,<br> let's call it, the terms<br> of my conditional surrender.<br> If that tastes better<br> going down.<br> You know,<br> where I'm from...<br> Yeah?<br> Where is that exactly?<br> Maynardville,<br> Tennessee.<br> I've done my share<br> of bootlegging.<br> Up there, if you engage in what the<br> federal government calls illegal activity,<br> but what we call just a man trying<br> to make a living for his family<br> selling moonshine liquor, it<br> behooves oneself to keep his wits.<br> Long story short, we hear<br> a story too good to be true,<br> it ain't.<br> Sitting in your chair, I would<br> probably say the same thing,<br> and 999. 999 times out of a<br> million, you would be correct.<br> But in the pages of history,<br> every once in a while,<br> fate reaches out<br> and extends its hand.<br> What shall<br> the history books read?<br> [PEOPLE ON FILM SHOUTING]<br> [GUNFIRE]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [SCREAMING]<br> MAN: I implore you.<br> We must destroy that tower.<br> Sarge, that tower...<br> MAN: The tower stands!<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> Psst! Psst!<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [GUNFIRE]<br> [PEOPLE CHEERING]<br> HANS: So when the military<br> history of this night is written,<br> it will be recorded that I<br> was part of Operation Kino<br> from the very beginning<br> as a double agent.<br> Anything I've done in<br> my guise as an SS Colonel<br> was sanctioned by the OSS<br> as a necessary evil<br> to establish my cover<br> with the Germans.<br> And it was my placement of<br> Lieutenant Raine's dynamite<br> in Hitler and Goebbels' opera<br> box that assured their demise.<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> By the way, that last<br> part is actually true.<br> I want my full military pension<br> and benefits under my proper rank.<br> I want to receive the<br> Congressional Medal of Honor<br> for my invaluable assistance in<br> the toppling of the Third Reich.<br> In fact, I want all the<br> members of Operation Kino<br> to receive the<br> Congressional Medal of Honor.<br> Full citizenship for myself.<br> Well, that goes without saying.<br> And I would like<br> the United States of America<br> to purchase property for me<br> on Nantucket Island<br> as a reward for all the<br> countless lives I've saved<br> by bringing the tyranny of<br> the National Socialist Party<br> to a swifter-than-imagined<br> end. Do you have all that, sir?<br> I look forward to seeing you<br> face to face as well, sir.<br> Lieutenant Raine?<br> Right here.<br> Yes, sir.<br> GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you and<br> Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.<br> Then he and his radio operator will<br> get in the truck and drive to our lines.<br> Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa<br> and his man will surrender to you.<br> You will then take over<br> driving of the truck<br> and bring them straight to me for<br> debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Over and out.<br> [GUNFIRE]<br> [AUDIENCE CHEERING]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> [CHIMING]<br> [KNOCKING ON DOOR]<br> [SPEAKING FRENCH]<br> [SIGHS]<br> [GUNFIRE ON FILM]<br> [GROANS]<br> [MOANS]<br> [SCREAMS]<br> When I kill that guy, you got<br> Can you do it?<br> I have to.<br> [AUDIENCE CHEERING]<br> Champagne?<br> [GUNSHOT]<br> [SCREAMING]<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> Who wants to send<br> a message to Germany?<br> I have a message<br> for Germany.<br> That you are<br> all going to die.<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> And I want you to look deep into the<br> face of the Jew who's going to do it!<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> Marcel, burn it down.<br> Oui, Shosanna.<br> [LAUGHING]<br> [PEOPLE SCREAMING]<br> My name<br> is Shosanna Dreyfus,<br> and this is the face<br> of Jewish vengeance.<br> [SHOSANNA LAUGHING]<br> [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br> HANS: Hermann,<br> uncuff them.<br> I'm officially surrendering myself<br> over to you, Lieutenant Raine.<br> We're your prisoners.<br> How about my knife?<br> [CHUCKLES]<br> Thank you very much,<br> Colonel.<br> Utivich, cuff the Colonel's<br> hands behind his back.<br> Is that really<br> necessary?<br> I'm a slave<br> to appearances.<br> [GUNSHOT]<br> Scalp Hermann.<br> Are you mad?<br> What have you done?<br> I made a deal with your<br> general for that man's life!<br> Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't<br> give a fuck about him. They need you.<br> You'll be shot for this!<br> Nah, I don't think so. More like<br> chewed out. I've been chewed out before.<br> You know, Utivich and myself heard<br> that deal you made with the brass.<br> End the war tonight?<br> I'd make that deal.<br> How about you, Utivich?<br> You make that deal?<br> I'd make that deal.<br> I don't blame you.<br> Damn good deal.<br> And that pretty little nest<br> you feathered for yourself.<br> Well, if you're willing to<br> barbecue the whole High Command,<br> I suppose that's worth<br> certain considerations.<br> But I do have<br> one question.<br> When you get to your little<br> place on Nantucket Island,<br> I imagine you are going to take off that<br> handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.<br> Ain't you?<br> That's what I thought.<br> Now, that I can't abide.<br> How about you, Utivich,<br> can you abide it?<br> Not one damn bit, sir.<br> I mean,<br> if I had my way,<br> you'd wear that goddamn uniform for<br> the rest of your pecker-sucking life.<br> But I'm aware<br> that ain't practical.<br> I mean, at some point, you're<br> going to have to take it off.<br> So,<br> I'm going to give you a little<br> something you can't take off.<br> [HANS SCREAMING]<br> You know something,<br> Utivich?<br> I think this just might be<br> my masterpiece.<br>
