Here's another one.<br> "Monkey Shines In Hillsboro."<br> The whole world's laughing at us.<br> Look. From Chicago.<br> "Heavenly Hillsboro. Does it have<br> a hole in its head or its head in a hole?"<br> I'm telling you we've gone too far.<br> Let 'em laugh. We fighting<br> the Lord's battle, ain't we?<br> I'd rather have a heathen laughing at me<br> than have my sons laughing at my Bible.<br> They mocked the Lord too.<br> They smote him and spat upon him<br> and he turned his other cheek.<br> Reverend, we don't want to smite 'em<br> back. We just want to make 'em stop.<br> Tom, you're a prosecuting attorney.<br> What can we do?<br> In view of my position, I hardly think<br> it ethical to express my opinion.<br> You'd better go back to law school.<br> What do we care what a bunch<br> of foreigners and city slickers think?<br> - Ever had a Frenchman at your hotel?<br> - You're missing...<br> How long since you sold a pound of grits<br> to some smart aleck from New York?<br> Heaven has chosen us to light the road<br> back to the shepherd, back to the fold.<br> - We're not sheep.<br> - I'd rather be a sheep than a Judas goat!<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> As mayor, I stand to uphold<br> the laws of this community,<br> no matter how<br> it may affect my political future.<br> Now, I shall just ignore these slanders,<br> like water off a duck's back.<br> You only got two months more as mayor<br> and you shouldn't have been elected.<br> You've been a lousy mayor!<br> (glass rings)<br> My friends,<br> as you all know, I deal with figures:<br> accounts, cheques, balances.<br> My bank operates on the principle<br> of practical reality and so do I.<br> Are you aware that the great big<br> universities throughout the country<br> will consider student applicants from<br> our state ineligible because of this law?<br> I don't know whose idea it was to hang up<br> a shingle spelling "horse and buggy",<br> but, as for me, I won't invest in antiquity.<br> I want my bank holding credit<br> with New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois.<br> And I may want my son to go to Yale.<br> Now, I believe,<br> just as much as anyone in this room,<br> in a basic fundamentalist<br> interpretation of the Bible.<br> But we can't close our eyes to all<br> progress, everything which represents...<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute!<br> "Matthew Harrison Brady<br> volunteers to prosecute in monkey trial."<br> Matthew Harrison Brady.<br> - The Lord has sent us his right hand.<br> - And I'll be working with him.<br> They'll pour out of the hills. This town<br> will fill up like a rain barrel in a flood.<br> It'll be bigger than<br> the chautauqua at Chattanooga.<br> People will have to have<br> someplace to stay.<br> And they gotta eat.<br> This will put Hillsboro<br> on the map of this country.<br> Let us give thanks to the Lord.<br> Let us pray.<br> You better start praying, son.<br> Imagine, Matthew Harrison Brady<br> coming here.<br> I voted for him for president. Twice.<br> Once in 1900 and again in '08.<br> I wasn't old enough to vote for him<br> the first time he run, but my pa did.<br> I seen him once.<br> At a chautauqua meeting in Chattanooga.<br> When he spoke, the tent poles shook.<br> - Who's gonna be your lawyer?<br> - I don't know yet.<br> I wrote to that newspaper in Baltimore.<br> They're sending somebody.<br> Well, he'd better be loud.<br> - (knocking)<br> - Ah.<br> Probably one of those newspaper<br> reporters. You're a popular fella.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, Bert.<br> You don't mind, do you? Just for<br> the looks of it. Can't tell who it might be.<br> Sure. Don't worry about it, Mort.<br> (knocking)<br> (knocking)<br> All right.<br> - Who is it?<br> - (woman) Mort?<br> Rachel! Come on in.<br> Ah, you got a present for Bert, huh?<br> Mort, don't let my father know<br> I came here.<br> The Reverend don't tell me his business.<br> I don't see why I should tell him mine.<br> - Is Bert all right?<br> - Of course he's...<br> The safest place in the world's in a jail.<br> Come on in. Come on.<br> Tell them you're sorry.<br> Tell them it was all a mistake. Please te...<br> Tell them if they let my body out of jail<br> I'd lock up my mind?<br> Could you stand that, Rachel?<br> - At least we'd be together.<br> - It wouldn't be the...<br> It wouldn't be the same.<br> Rachel.<br> Do you remember those warm dark nights<br> down by the river bank?<br> Just watching the water.<br> Wondering about the miracle of it.<br> Wondering what the stars were for.<br> What's on the other side of the moon.<br> There'd be no more of that, Rach.<br> - We could still have that.<br> - No, we couldn't.<br> That'd be in the locked-off part.<br> For both of us.<br> (man) Well!<br> So this is where the fate of learning<br> will be decided for the next 10,000 years.<br> O tempora, o mores.<br> Well, I see we have<br> both beauty and biology on our side.<br> - Who are you?<br> - This your writing?<br> - Yes.<br> - This is mine.<br> Hornbeck. EK Hornbeck.<br> Baltimore Herald.<br> - I've been waiting to hear from you.<br> - Read it.<br> My typewriter's been singing a sweet<br> sad song about the Hillsboro heretic.<br> B Cates: latter-day Dreyfus,<br> Romeo with a biology book.<br> Want a bite?<br> Don't worry, I'm not the serpent.<br> This isn't from the tree of knowledge.<br> Oh, no. You won't find one<br> growing in heavenly Hillsboro.<br> A few ignorance bushes, perhaps,<br> but no tree of knowledge.<br> Ask Adam.<br> You make me sound like a martyr.<br> You could be. Martyrs always have<br> a point to prove and so do you.<br> But you haven't won your halo yet.<br> That won't come until after they've<br> tossed you into the arena with the lion.<br> - You mean Brady?<br> - I don't want Bert to be a martyr.<br> - What are you trying to prove?<br> - I'm not trying to prove anything.<br> All I wanna do is teach my students that<br> man wasn't planted here like a geranium.<br> That life comes from a long miracle,<br> it didn't take seven days.<br> But it's against the law.<br> A schoolteacher's a public servant.<br> He should do what the law<br> and the school board want him to.<br> Has the accused<br> anything to say in his defence?<br> If not, I sentence you<br> to life as a public servant,<br> a silent butler<br> in the service of your school board.<br> Wastebaskets for ideas<br> on sale in the outer lobby.<br> I don't see anything funny in this,<br> Mr Hornbeck.<br> - Objection sustained. Neither do I.<br> - Then why don't you leave us alone?<br> You newspaper people have stirred up<br> enough trouble for Bert.<br> What do you want anyway?<br> I came to tell boy Socrates here<br> that the Baltimore Herald is opposed<br> to hemlock and will provide a lawyer.<br> - Who?<br> - Who? I don't know yet.<br> What's the difference? A new lawyer with<br> old tricks, an old lawyer with new tricks.<br> Wake up, Copernicus. The law's<br> still on the side of the lawmakers,<br> and everything revolves<br> around their terra firma.<br> Then why bother,<br> you and your newspaper?<br> Because I know<br> that the sunrise is an optical illusion.<br> My teacher told me so.<br> You don't seem like the kind<br> who'd want to bother. You seem so...<br> Cynical. True, true.<br> That's part of my fascination.<br> I do hateful things<br> for which people love me,<br> and I do lovable things<br> for which they hate me.<br> I'm admired for my detestability.<br> Now, don't worry, little Eva.<br> I may be rancid butter,<br> but I'm on your side of the bread.<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> And it's good enough for me<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> It was good for little David<br> It was good for little David<br> It was good for little David<br> And it's good enough for me<br> Oh, gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> It was good for little David<br> It was good for little David<br> It was good for little David<br> And it's good enough for me<br> Oh, gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> And it's good enough for me<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> It was good for old Jonah<br> And it's good enough for me<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> Matthew Harrison Brady,<br> as mayor of Hillsboro<br> may I say that this municipality<br> is proud to have within its city limits<br> the warrior who has always fought<br> for us ordinary people.<br> The ladyfolk of this town<br> would not have the vote<br> if it hadn't been for you fighting<br> to give them all that suffrage.<br> Mr President Wilson would not have<br> got to the White House and won the war<br> if it hadn't been for you supporting him<br> and being his secretary of state.<br> In conclusion,<br> the governor of our glorious state<br> has vested in me the authority<br> to confer upon you<br> a commission as honorary colonel<br> in the state militia!<br> (cheering)<br> It is good enough for Brady...<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> And it's good enough for me<br> (cheering)<br> "Colonel Brady."<br> I like the sound of that.<br> Friends,<br> Mrs Brady and I<br> are delighted to be among you.<br> We all voted for you. Three times!<br> I trust it was in three separate elections.<br> (laughter)<br> I can only wish for one thing:<br> that you had not given us<br> quite so warm a welcome.<br> - (woman) Mr Brady?<br> - Yes.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Oh, bless you.<br> - And Mrs Brady.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Now, who, may I ask,<br> is the spiritual leader of the community?<br> The Reverend Jeremiah Brown.<br> How are you, Reverend? Will you stand<br> here at my side? Thank you.<br> My friends of Hillsboro,<br> you know why I've come here.<br> It is not merely<br> to prosecute a lawbreaker,<br> a young man who has spoken out<br> against the revealed word.<br> I have come here<br> because what has happened in your town<br> has unloosed a wicked attack<br> from the big cities of the North.<br> We did not seek this struggle.<br> We are simple folk who seek only<br> to live in brotherhood and peace,<br> to cherish our loved ones,<br> to teach our children the ways<br> of righteousness and of the Lord.<br> But what would they teach them,<br> these idolaters?<br> These priests of evolution,<br> what would they have them do?<br> Measure the distance between the stars<br> and forget him who holds the stars.<br> They are lost, my friends.<br> I tell you, if man believes he is descended<br> from the beasts, he must remain a beast.<br> And as the young wolf turns upon the old,<br> these innocent ones,<br> corrupted and despairing of salvation,<br> will turn upon their fathers,<br> and our land will become<br> a land of Sodom and Gomorrah,<br> of pestilence, of fire,<br> of hatred and of death.<br> - I disagree.<br> - (woman) What a nerve!<br> Who are you?<br> Uh, Hornbeck.<br> EK Hornbeck of the Baltimore Herald.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, I know your paper.<br> And your writing, sir.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> my paper is happy to announce<br> that it is sending two representatives<br> to heavenly Hillsboro.<br> The most gifted reporter<br> in America today, myself,<br> and the most agile legal mind<br> of the 20th century, Henry Drummond.<br> - Henry Drummond?<br> - Who's Henry Drummond?<br> - We'll send him back to hell!<br> - Ride him out on a rail!<br> - Don't let him in the town!<br> - Keep him out! Keep him out!<br> (shouting)<br> No, no, no!<br> I believe we should<br> welcome Henry Drummond.<br> If the enemy sends his Goliath into battle,<br> it magnifies our cause.<br> Henry Drummond has stalked<br> the courtrooms of this land for 40 years.<br> When he fights, headlines follow.<br> The whole world will be watching<br> our victory over Drummond.<br> If St George had killed a dragonfly instead<br> of a dragon, who would remember him?<br> (laughter)<br> We have not only the opportunity to slay<br> the devil's disciple but the devil himself!<br> It is good enough for Brady...<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> And it's good enough for me<br> Oh, gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> It's good enough for me<br> Oh, gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time religion<br> Gimme that old-time...<br> You're the stranger, ain't you?<br> Are you looking<br> for a nice clean place to stay?<br> I had a nice clean place to stay, madam,<br> and I left it to come here.<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> It is good enough for Brady<br> And it's good enough for me<br> Oh, gimme that old-time...<br> (plays hymn on harmonium)<br> Rachel.<br> I waited supper for you. It's on the table.<br> Peace will come, my daughter.<br> We must thank God<br> that the sinner stands naked and exposed.<br> Stop preaching, Pa.<br> I have something to tell you.<br> You're upset.<br> Eat and we'll talk in the morning.<br> No. Now.<br> I'm not leaving Bert.<br> I don't understand.<br> You heard what Mr Brady said.<br> I love him, Pa. I love him.<br> No, no. That is the love of Judas.<br> He has nothing to offer you but sin.<br> I told you that from the beginning.<br> What's he done?<br> What's he done that's so terrible?<br> Why do you hate him so?<br> Because I love God<br> and I hate his enemies.<br> - Bert loves God.<br> - Then what is he doing with Drummond?<br> Why is he bringing him here to spew his<br> atheistic filth into the ears of our people?<br> You're a schoolteacher.<br> You know how easy it is to mould minds<br> for good or to twist them for evil.<br> - Bert didn't twist any minds.<br> - You're infected with his agnosticism!<br> - Get down and pray for forgiveness.<br> - Forgiveness for what?<br> Because you have betrayed me<br> and your faith.<br> I'm not betraying anybody.<br> I'm glad your mother isn't here<br> to see what's become of you.<br> - Pa, please listen.<br> - If she is looking down from heaven,<br> I ask her to forgive you<br> and to forgive me.<br> Pa, ever since I was a little girl,<br> I'd wake up in the middle of the night<br> afraid of the dark,<br> like the whole house was upside down<br> and if I didn't hang on to the mattress,<br> I'd fall out into the sky.<br> Forgive her, Mother.<br> Forgive her, dear God.<br> I wanted to run to you<br> to have you tell me that I was safe,<br> that everything was all right,<br> but I was always more afraid of you<br> than of falling.<br> - It's the same way now!<br> - I have failed. I have failed.<br> Tell me what to do, dear Lord.<br> Guide my faltering...<br> - Pa.<br> - I love my daughter.<br> - How can I save her? Tell me what to do.<br> - Please get up!<br> And I will sprinkle clean water upon you<br> and you shall be clean.<br> From all your filthiness<br> and from your idols will I cleanse you.<br> And a new heart also will I give you,<br> and a new spirit put within you.<br> And I will tear out the stony heart of flesh,<br> and I will give you a heart of flesh.<br> - Hello, devil. Welcome to hell.<br> - Hello, Hornbeck.<br> Hillsboro, heavenly Hillsboro,<br> the buckle on the Bible Belt.<br> Come on.<br> Where are we staying?<br> We're sharing a room<br> at the Mansion House.<br> Like everything else in this town,<br> misnamed.<br> Follow me and I shall point out<br> the unplumbed and plumbingless depths.<br> Bible? Bible?<br> Hot dogs. Here you are. Get your red-hot.<br> That poses a pretty problem. Which<br> is hungrier, my stomach or my soul?<br> - Hot dog.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What do you think of<br> all these monkey kinds?<br> Got no opinion, sir.<br> Opinions are bad for business.<br> Are you an evolutionist,<br> an infidel, a sinner?<br> The worst kind. I write for a newspaper.<br> - Want a hot dog?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Then you, sir, you must be a man of God.<br> No, no, no. Ulcers.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, devolution<br> is not a theory but a proven fact.<br> My friends,<br> man did not evolve from the ape,<br> but the ape devolved from man.<br> Take a look at this creature sitting here.<br> There before you<br> is an example of the ungrace<br> to which man can fall<br> because of his own bestiality.<br> Look at those beetling brows.<br> Look at those shifty eyes.<br> For as sure as the good Lord<br> cast out Satan from heavenly glory,<br> so did he devolve<br> this poor beast from man.<br> Quit looking at me, will you, son?<br> These are the wages of sin, my friends.<br> You take a lesson. Look and beware.<br> I thank you. Your contributions<br> will be gratefully received.<br> Grandpa. Welcome to Hillsboro, sir.<br> Have you come to testify<br> for the prosecution or the defence?<br> You.<br> - Are you Henry Drummond?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - I'm Royce McHenry, farmer hereabouts.<br> - Nice to know you.<br> I wanna tell you<br> we're just plain folk down here.<br> We don't need no outsiders<br> to tell us how or what to think.<br> That isn't my mission, Mr McHenry.<br> Then why don't you go back<br> where you came from?<br> Hmm.<br> - Pretty hot, aren't they?<br> - Their messiah arrived yesterday.<br> Drummond, why don't you give<br> your ulcers a break and go home?<br> You'll win no victories here.<br> I've been a lawyer long enough<br> to know there are no total victories.<br> There's only one man in this town<br> who thinks at all and he's in jail.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> Just plain folk, second generation.<br> Mr Drummond?<br> We're all members<br> of Mr Cates' homeroom and biology class.<br> We all like Mr Cates very much.<br> And we hope you do right by him.<br> Well, so do I, son. So do I.<br> - Sarah!<br> - It's good to see you, Henry.<br> I only wish it were<br> under different circumstances.<br> Sarah, you look lovelier than ever.<br> Oh, you know Mr Hornbeck?<br> - How do you do, Mrs Brady?<br> - How do you do?<br> Aha!<br> Excuse me.<br> Henry! Henry Drummond!<br> - How are you, Henry?<br> - Hello, Matt.<br> See you've already made<br> some young friends.<br> - Youth appeals to me these days.<br> - Room 206, Mr Drummond.<br> Neither of us is getting any younger.<br> Matt, you know what the doctor said<br> about not overeating in this heat.<br> Don't worry, Mother.<br> We need strength for the fight ahead.<br> - I'll take up your bags.<br> - Thank you.<br> Oh, it's you again, Mr Hornbeck.<br> I read your article yesterday.<br> Very biased reporting, I must say.<br> Mr Brady, it's the duty of a newspaper<br> to comfort the afflicted<br> and afflict the comfortable.<br> I don't like that fella. Oh!<br> Henry, I'd like for you to meet some of the<br> people of Hillsboro. Mr Carter, the mayor.<br> - Welcome to Hillsboro.<br> - Thank you.<br> Prosecuting attorney for this district,<br> Mr Davenport. We'll be working together.<br> Mr Drummond, let me assure you that<br> while we may not agree with your ideas,<br> - we respect your right to voice them.<br> - Good boy.<br> Drummond and I have worked side by<br> side in many battles for the common folk.<br> Twice he campaigned for me<br> when I ran for president.<br> That's right.<br> After all these years we find ourselves<br> on the opposite side of an issue.<br> Well, that's evolution for you.<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> Good day, young gentlemen,<br> and thank you. Sarah.<br> Goodbye, Henry.<br> (cheering)<br> (booing)<br> I believe we can desist with the taking<br> of photographs for the time being.<br> Mr Drummond, is the defence ready<br> for the selection of the next juror?<br> - The defence is ready, Your Honour.<br> - Colonel Brady, is the prosecution ready?<br> The prosecution is ready.<br> Mort, call a venireman to fill<br> the twelfth and last seat on the jury.<br> - Jesse H Dunlap.<br> - Here, sir.<br> - You're next, Jesse.<br> - (shouting)<br> (judge bangs gavel)<br> Order in the court!<br> Order in the court!<br> I wanna warn the spectators that the court<br> will not tolerate any undue disturbance.<br> The 11th juror...<br> I thought I made myself plain.<br> I'm not gonna warn you again...<br> as John P Carmody...<br> And you reporters have just one more<br> minute on those telephones.<br> (reporters talking)<br> As you know, for all last night and today<br> the legion of the unwashed and holy have<br> been rivering out of the rustic backways<br> to listen to their plump messiah<br> coo and bellow.<br> The high priest of mumbo jumbo,<br> Matthew Harrison Brady,<br> has alternately been stuffing himself<br> with fried chicken<br> and belching platitudes<br> since his arrival here two days ago.<br> (gavel)<br> Can we continue, Colonel Brady?<br> Your Honour, before we continue,<br> will the court entertain a motion<br> on a matter of procedure?<br> Will the learned prosecutor<br> state the motion?<br> It has been called to my attention<br> that the temperature in this courtroom<br> is now 97 degrees Fahrenheit.<br> And it may get hotter.<br> (laughter)<br> I do not think<br> the dignity of this court will suffer<br> if we remove<br> a few superfluous outer garments.<br> Does the defence have any objection<br> to Colonel Brady's motion?<br> I don't know if the dignity of this court<br> can be upheld with these galluses.<br> We'll take that chance, Mr Drummond.<br> Those who wish to remove<br> their coats may do so.<br> Is the counsel for the defence<br> showing us the latest fashion from<br> the great metropolitan city of Chicago?<br> (laughter)<br> Glad you asked me that.<br> I brought these along special.<br> I bought these in Peabody's general store,<br> in your home town, Mr Brady,<br> Weeping Water, Nebraska.<br> (laughter)<br> (gavel)<br> Let us proceed with the selection<br> of the final juror. Mort.<br> State your name and occupation, Jess.<br> Jesse H Dunlap. Farmer.<br> - Mr Davenport.<br> - Right.<br> Do you believe in the Bible, Mr Dunlap?<br> I believe in the holy word of God.<br> And I believe in Matthew Harrison Brady.<br> Amen!<br> Hallelujah, brother.<br> (applause followed by gavel)<br> This man is acceptable<br> to the prosecution.<br> - (judge) Mr Drummond?<br> - No questions. Not acceptable.<br> Does Mr Drummond<br> refuse this man a place on the jury<br> because he believes in the Bible?<br> If you find an evolutionist in this town,<br> you can refuse him.<br> I object to the defence attorney<br> rejecting a worthy citizen<br> without so much as<br> asking him a question.<br> All right, I'll ask him a question.<br> How are you?<br> Well, kinda hot.<br> Me too. Excused.<br> (laughter)<br> (gavel)<br> You are excused from jury duty, Jesse.<br> You may step down.<br> Your Honour,<br> I object to the note of levity which the<br> counsel for the defence is introducing.<br> The court agrees with you, Colonel Brady.<br> And I object to all this<br> "Colonel Brady" talk.<br> I am not familiar<br> with Mr Brady's military record.<br> He was made honorary colonel<br> in our state militia the day he arrived.<br> The use of the title<br> prejudices the case of my client.<br> It calls up a picture of the prosecution<br> astride a white horse<br> ablaze in the uniform of a military colonel,<br> and with all the forces of right and<br> righteousness marshalled behind him.<br> We want to give you<br> a fair hearing in this courtroom.<br> We don't want anything prejudicial<br> to your client.<br> What do you suggest we do, Counsellor?<br> Break him. Make him a private.<br> I have no serious objection<br> to the honorary title of Private Brady.<br> You'd better do something about this,<br> Jason.<br> - Get him up here.<br> - Oh, Mr Drummond.<br> - You know our mayor?<br> - Yes.<br> I believe he has a suggestion to make.<br> By authority of, uh...<br> I'm sure the governor won't object.<br> I hereby appoint you a temporary<br> honorary colonel in the state militia.<br> Well! Well, gentlemen, what can I say?<br> It is not every day that a man attains the<br> position of temporary honorary colonel.<br> I thank you.<br> Colonel Brady, Colonel Drummond,<br> you will examine the next venireman.<br> Mort.<br> George Sillers.<br> You're next, George.<br> State your name and occupation, George.<br> George Sillers. I work at the feed store.<br> Tell me, sir,<br> would you call yourself a religious man?<br> I'm as religious as the next fella.<br> In Hillsboro, sir, that means a great deal.<br> (murmurs of agreement)<br> Tell me, Mr Sillers,<br> do you have any children?<br> Not as I know of.<br> (laughter)<br> If you had a son, or a daughter,<br> what would you think<br> if that sweet child came home from<br> school and told you a godless teacher...<br> Objection! We're supposed<br> to be selecting jury members.<br> The prosecution is denouncing the<br> defendant before the trial has even begun.<br> Objection sustained.<br> Do you have any personal opinions<br> with regard to the defendant<br> that might prejudice you on his behalf?<br> - Cates?<br> - Hm.<br> I don't hardly know the man.<br> He bought some peat marsh from me<br> one time. He paid his bill.<br> Mr Sillers impresses me as an honest,<br> God-fearing man. I accept him.<br> Thank you, Colonel Brady.<br> Colonel Drummond?<br> Mr Sillers, you have just said that you are<br> a religious man. Do you work at it hard?<br> I'm pretty busy down at the feed store.<br> My wife tends the religion for both of us.<br> Oh, I see. I see.<br> You take care of this life<br> and she takes care of the next one?<br> That is objected to<br> as immaterial and argumentative.<br> (judge) Objection sustained.<br> While your wife has been<br> taking care of the religion,<br> have you ever heard of<br> a fella called Charles Darwin?<br> - Not till recent.<br> - Tell me something.<br> From what you've heard, is he the kind<br> of man you'd invite for Sunday dinner?<br> My opponent from Chicago is cluttering<br> up the issue with hypothetical questions.<br> I have established that Mr Sillers<br> is not working very hard at religion.<br> Now, for your sake, I'm trying to establish<br> that he is not working at evolution.<br> I'm just working at the feed store.<br> (laughter followed by gavel)<br> - Mr Sillers, do you think you can render...<br> - Objection. The prosecution's accepted...<br> - All I want is a fair trial.<br> - So do I.<br> Unless the state of mind of the members<br> of the jury conforms to the laws...<br> Oh, conform, conform!<br> Do you want to run the jury through<br> a meat grinder so they're all the same?<br> Take a box seat there, Mr Sillers.<br> Your Honour, this is ludicrous!<br> Gentlemen, you are both out of order.<br> The bench rules<br> that the jury has been selected.<br> Due to the excessive heat, court is<br> adjourned until ten tomorrow morning.<br> One moment, please. One moment.<br> Order in the court.<br> Reverend Brown has asked me<br> to announce<br> that there will be a prayer meeting tonight<br> to pray for justice and guidance.<br> All are invited.<br> Your Honour, I object to<br> that commercial announcement.<br> - Commercial announcement?<br> - Of Reverend Brown's product.<br> Why don't you announce there<br> will be an evolution meeting?<br> - I have no knowledge of such a meeting.<br> - That's quite understandable.<br> It isn't enough that everybody has to pass<br> under a sign that says "Read Your Bible".<br> - I want that sign taken down.<br> - No! No!<br> No! No!<br> Or else I want another sign put up,<br> just as big, with just as big letters,<br> which says "Read Your Darwin".<br> (cheering followed by booing)<br> That's what I mean about this man.<br> - (judge) Order!<br> - Your Honour.<br> We want the counsel from the North<br> to get every fairness and consideration.<br> We must not forget he is our guest.<br> Guest, hell! I'm a lawyer in a courtroom!<br> Then behave like it! Stop using this court<br> as a platform for your obscene ideas,<br> trying to dirty the minds of our young.<br> You are both out of order.<br> The court is adjourned.<br> My conduct is not under question,<br> and certainly not by you.<br> - Your language is.<br> - I don't swear just for the hell of it.<br> Language is a poor enough means<br> of communication.<br> We should use all the words we've got.<br> Besides, there are damn few words<br> that anybody understands.<br> Henry Drummond, atheist!<br> You, what are you gonna say<br> in your paper now?<br> He that sups with the devil<br> must have a long spoon.<br> We'll fix you, Cates.<br> We'll run you out of town.<br> Well, anyway, the Baltimore Herald<br> is with you, right up to the lynching.<br> Bert.<br> You've got to call the whole thing off now.<br> - Who are you?<br> - This is Rachel Brown. We're engaged.<br> Reverend Brown's daughter?<br> Don't you see what's happening?<br> They're using you as a weapon<br> against your own people.<br> What you think or believe isn't the point<br> any more. You're helping something bad.<br> It's not as simple as all that.<br> Good or bad, black or white, day or night.<br> Do you know that at the top of the world,<br> twilight is six months long?<br> Bert and I don't live on top of the world.<br> We live in Hillsboro,<br> and when the sun goes down, it's dark.<br> Why do you come here<br> to make it different?<br> I didn't come to make Hillsboro different.<br> I came to defend his right to be different.<br> That's the point. How about it, boy?<br> I don't know what the point is any more.<br> I tried to open their kids' minds.<br> Their kids.<br> To give them knowledge they could use.<br> They're using it, as a stranglehold on me.<br> You're learning, Cates. Disillusionment<br> is what little heroes are made of.<br> Do I finish with<br> a paper medal on my chest?<br> "Bert Cates: world's biggest chump.<br> He died fighting." Let's face it.<br> - To him I'm a headline. To you, a cause.<br> - And to yourself?<br> All right, let's face it.<br> You chose to get into this by yourself.<br> You didn't get into it<br> because of his headline or my cause,<br> or maybe even because of their kids.<br> You got into it because of<br> something you believed in for yourself.<br> - I didn't believe it would happen this way.<br> - It can get worse.<br> Those people are in<br> a lean and hungry mood.<br> They look at me as if I was a murderer.<br> In a way you are.<br> You killed one of their fairy-tale notions.<br> They'll bring down the wrath of God,<br> Brady and the state legislature on you.<br> - You make a joke out of everything.<br> - Young lady,<br> I know what Bert is going through.<br> It's the loneliest feeling in the world.<br> It's like walking down an empty street<br> listening to your own footsteps.<br> But all you have to do is<br> to knock on any door and say:<br> "if you'll let me in,<br> I'll live the way you want me to live,<br> and I'll think the way<br> you want me to think."<br> And all the blinds'll go up,<br> all the doors'll open,<br> and you'll never be lonely ever again.<br> It's up to you, Cates. You just say<br> the word and we'll change the plea.<br> That is, of course, if you honestly believe<br> that the law is right and you're wrong.<br> If that's the case,<br> tell me and I'll pack my bag<br> and go back to Chicago,<br> where it's a nice cool 100 in the shade.<br> Bert, I've gone to my father's church<br> every Sunday as long as I can remember.<br> This is where I live.<br> This is where my children'll be born.<br> What kind of a life could we have?<br> What kind of life could we have<br> if I gave up now?<br> Your father's kind?<br> Hallelujah and ignorance here we come?<br> What goes on here is not necessarily<br> the Christian religion everyplace else.<br> Rach, I can't live the way you want me to.<br> You're the one who's got to decide.<br> It's his church or our house.<br> You can't live in both.<br> Sorry, Bert. I have to take you back now.<br> You ever been in love, Hornbeck?<br> Only with the sound of my own words,<br> thank God.<br> I have been to their cities<br> and I have seen the altars<br> upon which they sacrifice the futures<br> of their children to the gods of science.<br> And what are their rewards?<br> Confusion and self-destruction.<br> New ways to kill each other in wars.<br> The way of scientism<br> is the way of darkness.<br> Mr Brady, do you believe seriously<br> that the majority of the American people<br> hold with your views?<br> Not just the views of<br> Matthew Harrison Brady, Mr Hornbeck.<br> There isn't one state where<br> the evolutionists are in the majority.<br> It'll be the people themselves<br> who will speak.<br> How do you account for the unfortunate<br> comment that your crusade has aroused?<br> The attacks stem from a vociferous<br> minority which controls the press.<br> I hope you gentlemen - madam - will not<br> be influenced by this same negative bias.<br> Pardon me.<br> Thank you, O Lord, dear Father, from<br> whom all blessings flow, for thy bounty.<br> Make us worthy of thy grace. Amen.<br> Go ahead, Henry. I said grace for you too.<br> God may be a matter of indifference to the<br> evolutionists and the life beyond hold no...<br> - Sarah!<br> - But the mass of mankind will worship.<br> Justice rests...<br> Here, sit with me.<br> He'll be busy for a while.<br> Where is it?<br> The hat with the little blue feather.<br> Blue feather?<br> You used to wear it to all the conventions.<br> And it was much too becoming.<br> And whatever happened<br> to that skinny black tie you used to wear?<br> Not very attractive. Like an old shoelace.<br> It's back in the shoe.<br> How are you, Sarah? How are you?<br> - A little greyer, Henry. And you?<br> - A little grimmer.<br> I don't believe it. I watched you in court.<br> You seemed to enjoy it as much as ever.<br> That's Matt. He brings out the worst in me.<br> We've missed you, Henry.<br> You don't make many good friends<br> in a lifetime.<br> I never dreamed<br> our ideas would separate us.<br> (Brady) I have reason to be. I have<br> messages of encouragement from...<br> - He still has a loud voice.<br> - He still has something to say, Henry.<br> - About how everybody else should live?<br> - Oh, don't be cynical.<br> I think every man longs to be his brother's<br> keeper and to be cared for in return.<br> It sounds more convincing<br> coming from you.<br> He doesn't have a blue feather in his hat,<br> that's all.<br> You know, looking back, I don't think<br> Matt would have made a great president.<br> But I would have voted for him for king<br> just to have you for queen.<br> - What would you have been?<br> - Your Majesty's loyal opposition.<br> (Brady) ..the written word of the Bible.<br> I believe that Hillsboro... Pardon me.<br> Will become the shrine<br> of all those millions upon millions<br> who find a rallying point<br> for their expression of God's will.<br> That's all for today, gentlemen.<br> Hearken to the Word.<br> Hearken to the Word!<br> The Word tells us<br> that the world was created in six days.<br> In the beginning<br> the earth was without form and void,<br> and the Lord said "Let there be light."<br> - (crowd murmurs)<br> - And there was light.<br> (crowd murmurs)<br> The Lord saw the light and the light saw<br> the Lord and it said "Am I good, Lord?"<br> And the Lord said "Thou art good."<br> Amen!<br> (man) And the evening and the morning<br> were the first day.<br> The Lord said "Let there be a firmament."<br> And even as he spoke it was so.<br> And the evening and the morning<br> were the second day.<br> On the third day brought he forth the<br> dry land and the grass and the fruit tree.<br> And on the fourth day<br> the sun, the moon and the stars,<br> and he pronounced them good.<br> The fifth day peopled he the sea with fish<br> and the air with fowl<br> and made he the great whale.<br> And he blessed them all.<br> (crowd shouts)<br> But... on the morning of the sixth day<br> the Lord rose,<br> and his eye was dark<br> and a scowl lay across his face.<br> Why? Why was the Lord troubled?<br> - Why? Tell us!<br> - Tell us the troubles of the Lord!<br> Tell us the troubles of the Lord!<br> The Lord looked around at all<br> his handiwork, bowed down before him,<br> and he said "it is not good.<br> It is not enough. It is not finished!"<br> "I shall make me a man!"<br> (enthusiastic shouting)<br> - Do we believe?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do we believe the Word?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do we believe the truth of the Word?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do we curse him who denies the Word?<br> - Yes.<br> Do we call down hellfire on the man<br> who has sinned against the Word?<br> Yes!<br> Whatever happened to silent prayer?<br> O Lord of the tempest and the thunder,<br> strike down this sinner<br> as thou did thine enemies of old<br> in the days of the Pharaohs.<br> Let him know the terror of thy sword.<br> Let his soul, for all eternity,<br> writhe in anguish and damnation!<br> No! No, Pa! Don't pray to destroy Bert!<br> Lord, we ask this same curse<br> for those who ask grace for this sinner,<br> though they be blood of my blood<br> and flesh of my flesh!<br> Reverend Brown. Reverend Brown.<br> I know it's the great zeal of your faith<br> which makes you utter this prayer,<br> but it is possible to be overzealous,<br> to destroy that which you hope to save<br> so that nothing is left but emptiness.<br> Remember the wisdom of Solomon<br> in the Book of Proverbs.<br> "He that troubleth his own house<br> shall inherit the wind."<br> The Bible also tells us<br> that God forgives his children.<br> And we, as children of God,<br> should forgive each other.<br> My good friends, return to your homes.<br> Go home.<br> The blessings of the Lord be with you all.<br> We'll take you home.<br> - I can't go home. He hates me.<br> - He doesn't hate you.<br> He damned me.<br> My own father damned me to hell.<br> No man has the power to damn.<br> He's always done it. He did it to Bert<br> and the little Stebbins boy.<br> The Stebbins boy?<br> That's how the whole thing started.<br> The Stebbins boy<br> was just an innocent child.<br> God has no wrath for the innocent,<br> my dear.<br> That's what Bert said.<br> He used to say that<br> when we were together.<br> If I could just explain it clearly,<br> then you'd understand. Mr Brady, please...<br> We'll do all we can to help you.<br> Come. Now let's go home.<br> - I'll be right up, Sarah.<br> - All right, Matt.<br> - Good night, Henry.<br> - Good night.<br> - You're up late.<br> - Too hot to sleep.<br> No use trying to fool ourselves, Henry.<br> We're just not the men we used to be.<br> By the size of that meal you packed away,<br> I'd say you hadn't changed in 40 years.<br> Funny how two people can start<br> from the same point and drift apart.<br> It's the nature of the life process.<br> There used to be<br> a mutuality of understanding<br> and admiration between us, Henry.<br> Why is it, my old friend,<br> that you've moved so far away from me?<br> All motion is relative, Matt. Maybe it's you<br> who have moved away by standing still.<br> Hm.<br> If progress means abandoning God,<br> abandoning the faith of our fathers...<br> I saw a demonstration of that faith.<br> It's a deadly instrument.<br> You saw a reflection of the violence<br> and hate in the world around them.<br> Your world.<br> But they were driven to it<br> because their faith was challenged.<br> These are simple people, Henry.<br> Poor people.<br> They work hard and they need to believe<br> in something... something beautiful.<br> They're seeking something<br> more perfect than what they have.<br> Window-shopping for heaven.<br> Why do you want to take it away<br> from them? It's all they have.<br> Like a golden chalice of hope.<br> Ah.<br> Like my golden Dancer.<br> - Your what?<br> - Golden Dancer.<br> She stood in the side window<br> of the general store in Wakeman, Ohio.<br> I used to say to myself "If I had Golden<br> Dancer I'd have everything I ever wanted."<br> I was about seven years old at the time<br> and a great judge of rocking horses.<br> Golden Dancer had<br> a bright red mane, blue eyes,<br> and she was gold all over<br> with purple spots.<br> And when the sun hit her stirrups<br> she was a dazzling sight to behold.<br> But she was a week's wages<br> for my father.<br> So Golden Dancer and I always had<br> a big plate glass window between us.<br> And then...<br> Let's see...<br> Couldn't have been Christmas.<br> It must have been my birthday.<br> I woke in the morning and there was<br> Golden Dancer at the foot of my bed.<br> Mom had skimped on the groceries and<br> my father had worked nights for a month.<br> I jumped into the saddle<br> and I started to rock.<br> And it broke. Split in two.<br> The wood was rotten.<br> The whole thing was put together<br> with spit and sealing wax.<br> All shine and no substance.<br> And that's how I feel about that<br> demonstration I saw tonight, Matt.<br> All glitter.<br> You say you're giving the people hope.<br> - I think you're stealing their hope.<br> - No, Henry.<br> As long as the prerequisite for that shining<br> paradise is ignorance, bigotry and hate,<br> I say to hell with it.<br> ...to keep an open mind<br> on the origin of species.<br> Very interesting, Howard. Very interesting.<br> Now go on, Howard. Tell us what else<br> Mr Cates told you in the classroom.<br> He said first the earth was too hot<br> for any kind of life.<br> Then it cooled off a mite<br> and cells and things began to grow.<br> Cell...<br> Oh.<br> Mr McKennon, Mr Galbraith. I think<br> you know the rest of these gentlemen.<br> (gavel)<br> - Cells, Howard?<br> - Little bugs in the water.<br> The little bugs got to be bigger bugs,<br> sprouted legs and crawled up on the land.<br> How long did this take,<br> according to Mr Cates?<br> A couple of million years. Maybe longer.<br> Then comes the fishes, and reptiles<br> and mammals. Man's a mammal.<br> Along with the dogs.<br> And the cattle in the fields.<br> - Did he say that?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Now, Howard, how does man come out<br> of this slimy mess of bugs and serpents,<br> according to your professor?<br> Well, man has sort of evoluted<br> from the Old World monkeys.<br> Did you hear that, my friends?<br> Old World monkeys! Ha!<br> According to Mr Cates, you and I aren't<br> even descended from American monkeys.<br> Listen carefully.<br> In all this talk of bugs and evolution,<br> of slime and ooze,<br> did Mr Cates ever make<br> any reference to God?<br> - Not as I remember.<br> - Of the miracle he achieved in 7 days,<br> as described in the beautiful<br> Book of Genesis?<br> No, sir.<br> - Ladies and gentlemen...<br> - Objection.<br> I ask the court to remind the learned<br> counsel he is not in a chautauqua tent.<br> He is submitting evidence to a jury.<br> There are no ladies on the jury.<br> Your Honour,<br> I have no intention of making a speech.<br> There is no need.<br> I am sure that everyone on the jury,<br> everyone within the sound<br> of this boy's voice,<br> is moved by his tragic confusion.<br> He has been taught<br> that he wriggled up like an animal<br> from the filth and muck below.<br> I say that these Bible-haters,<br> these evolutionists are brewers of poison.<br> And the legislature of this sovereign state<br> has had the wisdom to demand<br> that the pedlars of poison,<br> in bottles or in books,<br> clearly label the product<br> they attempt to sell.<br> I say that if this law is not upheld,<br> this boy will become one of a generation<br> shorn of its faith<br> by the teachings of godless science.<br> But if the full penalty of the law<br> is meted out to Bertram Cates,<br> the faithful the whole world over,<br> who are watching us here<br> and listening to our every word,<br> will rise up<br> and call this courtroom blessed.<br> Your witness, sir.<br> I sure am glad<br> the colonel didn't make a speech.<br> Now, Howard.<br> I heard you say<br> that the world used to get pretty hot.<br> That's what Mr Cates said.<br> Any hotter than it is right now,<br> do you think?<br> I guess it must have been.<br> Mr Cates read it to us from a book.<br> This the book?<br> Charles Darwin's Theory Of The Evolution<br> And The Descent Of Man.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - That's right, Howard.<br> That's the very book<br> he read to you in your classroom.<br> Now, Howard, tell me, do you think<br> there was anything wrong in there?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Objection, Your Honour.<br> The defence is asking that a 15-year-old<br> give an opinion on a question of morality.<br> I am trying to establish that Howard<br> or Colonel Brady or Charles Darwin<br> or anyone sitting in this courtroom,<br> or you, sir, has the right to think.<br> Colonel Drummond,<br> the right to think is not on trial here.<br> With all due respect to the court, sir,<br> I think the right to think<br> is very much on trial here.<br> And it is in danger<br> in the proceedings of this courtroom.<br> - A man is on trial.<br> - A thinking man.<br> He's faced with fine and imprisonment<br> because he speaks what he thinks.<br> Colonel Drummond,<br> will you please rephrase your question?<br> Let's put it this way, Howard.<br> All this fuss and feathers about evolution,<br> do you think it hurt you any?<br> - Sir?<br> - Did it do you any harm?<br> Still feel reasonably fit?<br> What Mr Cates told you,<br> did it hurt your baseball game any?<br> Did it affect your pitching arm?<br> No, sir. I'm a lefty.<br> A southpaw, huh? Still honour<br> your father and your mother?<br> - Sure.<br> - Haven't murdered anybody, have you?<br> Objection.<br> This is an absurd piece of jactitation.<br> (judge clears throat)<br> Counsel uses a word<br> with which the bench is not familiar.<br> Jactitation: a specious or false premise.<br> In this instance as to the murder<br> of known or unknown persons.<br> Objection sustained.<br> Ask him if his faith in the Holy Scriptures<br> has been shattered.<br> When I need your help, Colonel Brady,<br> you may rest assured<br> I shall humbly ask for it.<br> Any time, Colonel Drummond. Any time.<br> He's the only man I know<br> who can strut sitting down.<br> Now, Howard, tell me something.<br> Did you believe<br> everything Mr Cates told you?<br> I'm not sure. I gotta think about it.<br> Good for you. Good for you.<br> - Now, your pa's a farmer, isn't he?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Got a tractor?<br> - Brand-new one.<br> You think there's anything sinful about<br> a tractor because it's not in the Bible?<br> No.<br> You know,<br> Moses never made a phone call.<br> Do you figure that makes the telephone<br> an instrument of the devil?<br> - I never thought of it that way.<br> - Neither did anybody else.<br> Your Honour, the defence makes<br> the same old error of all godless men.<br> He confuses material things with<br> the spiritual value of the revealed word.<br> Why do you bewilder this child?<br> Does right have no meaning to you, sir?<br> Realising that I may prejudice<br> the case of my client,<br> I must tell you that<br> right has no meaning for me whatsoever.<br> (murmuring)<br> But truth has meaning, as a direction.<br> But it is one of<br> the peculiar imbecilities of our time<br> that we place a grid of morality<br> upon human behaviour,<br> so that the action of every man<br> must be measured against an arbitrary<br> latitude of right and a longitude of wrong<br> in exact minutes, degrees and seconds.<br> So...<br> Howard, do you know... Do you<br> understand what I'm talking about?<br> No, sir.<br> Maybe someday you will. That's all, son.<br> Thank you. You're excused.<br> This boy may not understand, but I do.<br> I've seen what you can do to a jury.<br> Twist them.<br> In the Endicott case you made the jury<br> believe the obscenity was in their mind.<br> It was immoral what you did to the jury.<br> Judgement by confusion.<br> - You think you can get away with it here?<br> - I'm not trying to get away with anything.<br> I am simply trying<br> to prevent the clock-stoppers<br> from dumping a lot of medieval nonsense<br> into the United States Constitution.<br> This is not a federal court.<br> - You have to stop them somewhere!<br> - It's obvious what he's doing.<br> He is trying to make us forget<br> the lawbreaker and put the law on trial.<br> We have the answer for you<br> in our next witness.<br> Call Miss Rachel Brown to the stand.<br> (man) Rachel Brown!<br> Rachel Brown come to the stand, please.<br> Did you know about this?<br> He didn't, but we should have.<br> Rach?<br> - Rach, what did you tell him?<br> - Take it easy, son.<br> Sit down, Samson.<br> You're about to get a haircut.<br> Rachel, do you solemnly swear<br> the testimony you're about to give<br> is the truth, the whole truth and<br> nothing but the truth, so help you God?<br> I do.<br> Now, my dear, I just want you to repeat<br> some of the things you told me last night.<br> Please, Mr Brady.<br> You said you wanted people<br> to understand, didn't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Just answer my question.<br> Now, Miss Brown, you are an old friend<br> of the defendant, Bertram Cates?<br> We're engaged to be married.<br> - Do you attend the same church?<br> - Yes.<br> We did.<br> - Do you now?<br> - What?<br> Attend the same church.<br> No.<br> Did Mr Cates leave the church?<br> No. Not really. Not the spirit of it.<br> But the body of it. Correct?<br> Mr Cates left the church<br> you and he once attended together?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> - Because of the Stebbins boy.<br> - The Stebbins boy.<br> Would you tell us about that, please?<br> It was two summers ago.<br> The little Stebbins boy was 13 years old.<br> He was one of Bert's students. He lived<br> right next door to the boarding house,<br> and he used to come over<br> and look through Bert's microscope.<br> Bert said the boy had a bright mind<br> and he might even be a scientist<br> when he grew up.<br> Yes?<br> He went to the river with the other boys<br> and went swimming.<br> He... He got a cramp... and drowned.<br> Go on.<br> At the funeral, Pa preached<br> that Tommy didn't die in a state of grace<br> because his father wouldn't allow him<br> to be baptised.<br> Tell 'em what your father really said.<br> That Tommy's soul was damned.<br> Cates, you sinner!<br> Religion's supposed to comfort people,<br> not frighten 'em to death!<br> (gavel)<br> We will have order, please.<br> Now, sit down, Bert.<br> Don't you see? Bert thought it wasn't fair<br> that a little child couldn't go to heaven.<br> It wasn't God he abandoned,<br> only the church.<br> It is true, then, that because of<br> what happened to the Stebbins boy,<br> Bert Cates left the church?<br> You've said nothing wrong.<br> We are merely gaining some insight<br> into the experiences that<br> sometimes will lead a young man astray.<br> Objection. Whether my client went astray<br> is a matter of interpretation.<br> Objection sustained. The jury is directed<br> to disregard the remarks of counsel.<br> Very well.<br> Will you tell the jury some more of Mr<br> Cates' opinions on the subject of religion?<br> Objection!<br> Hearsay evidence is not admissible.<br> The court sees no objection to this line<br> of questioning. Proceed, Colonel Brady.<br> Just repeat some of the conversations<br> you had with the defendant.<br> Rachel, you can't. The things I said to you<br> were questions you ask your own heart.<br> If you say them out loud,<br> you'll make them sound like answers.<br> - I can't.<br> - You won't hurt him.<br> This is for his good. Speak up.<br> - Mr Brady, I confided in you...<br> - We're here to serve the truth, Rachel.<br> I can't remember.<br> Rachel, you are testifying under oath.<br> It is unlawful<br> to withhold pertinent information.<br> Describe to the court your innermost<br> feelings when Bert Cates said to you:<br> "God did not create man.<br> Man created God."<br> Bert didn't say that. He was just bitter<br> because of the little Stebbins boy.<br> He said man created a vengeful God<br> out of his own bigotry, and the devil...<br> When he was wondering about the moon,<br> did he mention the possibility of heaven?<br> Or did he say there was nothing but<br> a world of stars and moons and galaxies?<br> What did he say about<br> the holy state of matrimony?<br> - Did he compare it to animals breeding?<br> - Objection!<br> You want people to see<br> what happened to his brain<br> so they can bring him back to his senses,<br> don't you? Come on! Tell it! Tell it all!<br> Matt!<br> (Rachel groans)<br> - Under the circumstances,<br> - (Rachel sobs)<br> I believe the witness should be excused.<br> Drummond, do you have any objection<br> to excusing the witness<br> from cross-examination at this time,<br> subject to later recall?<br> Your Honour, the defence must have<br> a chance to challenge the words<br> put into the mouth of the witness<br> by the prosecutor.<br> Don't plague her. Let her go.<br> May I have a moment, please?<br> Do you want every word he's put<br> into her mouth to go into the record?<br> - It's not that important.<br> - Not that...<br> They just pulled you apart.<br> - Please do as I say. You got to.<br> - I've got to what? Send you to jail?<br> - Let her go.<br> - You all-American idiot.<br> She handed them your head<br> on a silver platter...<br> Stay out of this!<br> It's none of your business.<br> Don't tie my hands, son.<br> Let her go or I'll change my plea to guilty.<br> No questions.<br> For the time being,<br> the witness is excused.<br> May I have your autograph?<br> Does the prosecution<br> wish to call any further witnesses?<br> Not at the present time, Your Honour.<br> The prosecution rests.<br> We shall proceed with the case<br> for the defence, Colonel Drummond.<br> I'd like to call Dr Amos Keller, the head<br> of Zoology at the University of Chicago.<br> - Objection.<br> - On what grounds?<br> I wish to enquire what possible relevance<br> the testimony of a zoology professor<br> can have in this trial.<br> Why, it has every relevance.<br> My client is on trial for teaching evolution.<br> Any testimony relating to his so-called<br> infringement of the law must be admitted.<br> - Irrelevant. Immaterial. Inadmissible.<br> - But why?<br> If Bertram Cates were on trial for murder,<br> would it be irrelevant to call in witnesses<br> to examine the weapon?<br> Would it rule out testimony that the<br> weapon was incapable of firing a bullet?<br> I fail to grasp<br> the learned counsel's meaning.<br> Oh.<br> Well, Your Honour, the defence<br> wishes to place Dr Keller on the stand<br> so that he can explain<br> to the gentlemen of the jury<br> the exact meaning<br> of the theory of evolution.<br> How can they judge<br> if they don't know what it's about?<br> I hold that the very law we are here<br> to enforce excludes such testimony.<br> The people of this state have made it clear<br> that they do not want zoological hogwash<br> slobbered around the schoolrooms.<br> And I refuse to allow<br> these agnostic scientists<br> to employ this courtroom<br> as a sounding board,<br> as a platform from which they can shout<br> their heresies into the headlines.<br> Colonel Drummond, the bench rules<br> that zoology is irrelevant to the case.<br> Agnostic scientists!<br> (clears throat)<br> I call Dr Allen Page,<br> deacon of the Congregational Church,<br> and professor of geology<br> and archaeology.<br> - Objection.<br> - Objection sustained.<br> Does Your Honour deny the existence<br> of zoology, geology and archaeology?<br> We do not deny<br> the existence of these sciences,<br> but they do not relate to this point of law.<br> I call Walter Aaronson,<br> anthropologist, philosopher, author,<br> and one of the most brilliant minds<br> in the world. Any objection?<br> - Objection.<br> - Your Honour,<br> the defence has brought, at great expense<br> and inconvenience, six noted scientists.<br> Their testimony is basic<br> to the defence of my client.<br> For I intend to show this court<br> that what Bertram Cates spoke quietly<br> one spring morning<br> in the Hillsboro high school is no crime.<br> It is incontrovertible as geometry<br> to any enlightened community of minds.<br> In this community, and in this sovereign<br> state, exactly the opposite is the case.<br> The language of the law is clear.<br> We do not need experts to question<br> the validity of a law already on the books.<br> What do you need?<br> A gallows to hang him from?<br> That remark<br> is an insult to this community.<br> And this community<br> is an insult to the world.<br> (murmuring followed by gavel)<br> Your Honour, I request permission<br> to withdraw from this case.<br> - You can't quit now.<br> - You were ready to five minutes ago.<br> Colonel Drummond.<br> What reasons can you possibly have?<br> Well, there are 200 of 'em.<br> And if that's not enough, there's one more.<br> I think my client<br> has already been found guilty.<br> Is Mr Drummond saying<br> that this expression of an honest emotion<br> will influence the court's<br> impartial administration of the law?<br> I say that you cannot administer<br> a wicked law impartially.<br> You can only destroy and punish.<br> And I warn you that a wicked law, like<br> cholera, destroys everyone it touches.<br> - Its upholders as well as its defiers.<br> - (judge) Colonel Drummond.<br> Can't you understand<br> that if you take a law like evolution<br> and make it a crime<br> to teach it in public schools,<br> tomorrow you could make it a crime<br> to teach it in private schools,<br> and tomorrow you may<br> make it a crime to read about it?<br> And soon you may<br> ban books and newspapers.<br> And then you may turn<br> Catholic against Protestant,<br> and Protestant against Protestant,<br> and try to foist your own religion<br> upon the mind of man.<br> If you can do one you can do the other,<br> because fanaticism and ignorance<br> is forever busy and needs feeding.<br> And soon, Your Honour, with<br> banners flying and with drums beating,<br> we'll be marching backward.<br> Backward!<br> Through the glorious ages<br> of that 16th century,<br> when bigots burned the man<br> who dared bring enlightenment<br> and intelligence to the human mind.<br> I hope counsel does not mean to imply<br> that this court is bigoted.<br> - Your Honour has the right to hope.<br> - I have the right to do more than that.<br> You have the power to do more than that.<br> And I exercise that power.<br> I order you to show cause<br> tomorrow morning at ten o'clock<br> why you should not<br> be held in contempt of court.<br> In the meanwhile, I order<br> that you be held in custody of the bailiff.<br> Bail is fixed at $2,000.<br> $2,000? Why don't you make it 4,000?<br> It's four, Colonel Drummond.<br> Your Honour, my paper will post the bond.<br> Can you prove legal authorisation to make<br> such a commitment for your employer?<br> - I'll wire my paper immediately.<br> - Fine.<br> Until then, Colonel Drummond can avail<br> himself of our municipal accommodation.<br> (murmuring)<br> Your Honour. Your Honour, sir.<br> I'll put up my farm for Mr Drummond.<br> We have no way of ascertaining<br> the value of your farm, sir.<br> It ought to be worth that much.<br> The law demands<br> that bond be posted in cash.<br> Your Honour, my bank will honour<br> the offer on the security of his farm.<br> He has considerably more equity<br> in it than that.<br> Very well. You can make arrangements<br> with the court clerk.<br> - Who are you?<br> - My name is John Stebbins.<br> (judge) The court will adjourn<br> and reconvene at 10am tomorrow.<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> Our God is marching on<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> She'll sleep all right tonight.<br> Give her these pills tomorrow<br> and keep her in bed.<br> Thank you, John.<br> Rachel.<br> Rachel?<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> Our God is marching on<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> His truth is marching on<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> We'll hang Bert Cates<br> to a sour apple tree<br> Our God is marching on<br> We'll hang Henry Drummond<br> to a sour apple tree<br> We'll hang Henry Drummond<br> to a sour apple tree<br> We'll hang Henry Drummond<br> to a sour apple tree<br> Our God is marching on<br> (knock at door)<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> Glory, glory, hallelujah<br> His truth...<br> Grrr!<br> - Trick or treat?<br> - Oh, for...<br> Hooligans of the world unite!<br> You've got nothing to burn<br> but your intellectuals.<br> Well, those are the boobs that make<br> our laws. It's the democratic process.<br> I suppose you have<br> something better to suggest.<br> We'll hang Henry Drummond<br> to a sour apple tree<br> Hm.<br> Looks like you're going out<br> in a blaze of glory, Counsellor.<br> Well, you were pretty impressive<br> for a while there today, Henry.<br> "Your Honour, after a while<br> you'll be setting man against man,<br> creed against creed, et cetera, et cetera.<br> Ad nauseam." Unquote.<br> Henry, why don't you wake up?<br> Darwin was wrong.<br> Man's still an ape<br> and his creed's still a totem pole.<br> When he first achieved the upright<br> position, he looked at the stars.<br> Thought they were something to eat.<br> He couldn't reach them, and he decided<br> they were groceries of a bigger creature.<br> That's how Jehovah was born.<br> I wish I had your worm's-eye view of<br> history. It would make things a lot easier.<br> Oh, no. Not for you. No.<br> You'd still be spending your time<br> trying to make sense out of what is<br> laughingly referred to as the human race.<br> Why don't you take your blinders off?<br> Don't you know<br> the future's already obsolete?<br> You think man still has a noble destiny.<br> Well, I tell you he's already started<br> on his backward march<br> to the salt and stupid sea<br> from which he came.<br> What about men like Bert Cates?<br> Cates?<br> A monkey who tried to fly.<br> Cates climbed to the top of the totem pole<br> but then he jumped.<br> And there was nobody there<br> to catch him. Not even you.<br> You were there.<br> You saw what they did to my witnesses.<br> - What you need's a drink.<br> - What I need is a miracle.<br> Miracle? Here's a whole bagful.<br> Courtesy of Matthew Harrison Brady.<br> Your Honour.<br> Your Honour, I feel I owe you an apology.<br> Any remarks leading up to<br> the contempt citation I regret.<br> I realise Your Honour is trying to be fair.<br> I'm very sorry for any remarks<br> that were made in the heat of the moment.<br> My friends, Colonel Drummond,<br> the man that I believe came<br> into the world to save mankind from sin<br> taught that it was godly to forgive.<br> I believe in those principles.<br> I accept Colonel Drummond's apology.<br> - I withdraw the contempt citation.<br> - Thank you.<br> I should like to add<br> that in the spirit of forgiveness<br> I feel no animosity<br> toward learned counsel from Chicago.<br> He is well known<br> to have ridden hobbyhorses before.<br> Perhaps he'll return home<br> having learned a lesson.<br> We commend him to learn<br> the words of him who said:<br> "if you thirst, come unto me<br> and I will give you life."<br> That's why he hasn't an enemy<br> in the world. Only his friends hate him.<br> (clears throat)<br> Perhaps there is much to learn<br> from the counsel for the prosecution.<br> Your Honour, there were<br> some remarks I made yesterday,<br> namely, that I wish to withdraw.<br> I should like to withdraw my withdrawal<br> and continue as counsel for Cates.<br> I see no reason why Colonel Drummond<br> should not continue as defence counsel.<br> - Proceed, Colonel Drummond.<br> - Thank you.<br> Your Honour, the court<br> has ruled out any evidence<br> as to scientific knowledge<br> or the Darwinian theory.<br> Would the court admit evidence,<br> expert evidence,<br> on a book known as the Holy Bible?<br> Any objection, Colonel Brady?<br> If counsel can advance the case<br> for the defendant<br> through the use of the Holy Scriptures,<br> prosecution'll take no exception.<br> Good. I call one of the world's foremost<br> experts on the Bible and its teachings.<br> Matthew Harrison Brady.<br> Your Honour, this is preposterous!<br> Brother, let us pray.<br> Well, it's highly unorthodox.<br> I've never known the defence to call<br> the prosecuting attorney as a witness.<br> Your Honour,<br> this entire trial is unorthodox.<br> But if the interests of right and justice<br> will be served, I will take the stand.<br> - But, Colonel Brady...<br> - (mutters)<br> The court will support you<br> if you wish to decline<br> to testify as a witness<br> against your own case.<br> Your Honour,<br> I shall not testify against anything.<br> I shall speak out, as I have all my life,<br> on behalf of the living truth<br> of the Holy Scriptures.<br> - Colonel Brady...<br> - It won't be necessary to swear him in.<br> I can make affirmation.<br> I've no objection to swearing to God.<br> I take it you will tell the truth.<br> Now, sir, I am right in calling upon you<br> as an authority on the Bible, am I not?<br> It is not boastful to say that I have studied<br> the Bible as much as any layman,<br> and I have tried to live<br> according to its precepts.<br> Bully for you.<br> I suppose you can quote me chapter<br> and verse in the King James Version.<br> There are many portions of the Holy Bible<br> that I have committed to memory.<br> I don't suppose you have committed<br> to memory The Origin Of The Species.<br> I am not interested in<br> the pagan hypotheses of that book.<br> - Never read it?<br> - I never will.<br> Then how in perdition<br> have you got the gall<br> to whoop up this holy war<br> about something you don't know about?<br> How can you be so cocksure<br> that the body of scientific knowledge<br> systematised<br> in the writings of Charles Darwin<br> is in any way irreconcilable<br> with the Book of Genesis?<br> Would you state that question again,<br> please?<br> Well now, let me put it this way.<br> On page ten of The Origin Of The Species,<br> Darwin states...<br> I object to this, Your Honour.<br> Colonel Brady was called<br> as an authority on the Bible.<br> The gentleman from Chicago is using<br> this opportunity to read into the record<br> scientific testimony which<br> you have previously ruled irrelevant.<br> If he's examining Colonel Brady on<br> the Bible, let him stick to the Bible -<br> the Holy Bible and only the Bible.<br> You will confine your questions<br> to the Bible.<br> All right. Forget it.<br> - We'll play in your ballpark, Colonel.<br> - (laughter)<br> Now, I'd like to get this part clear first.<br> This is the book<br> that you're an authority on, isn't it?<br> Correct.<br> You believe that every word written in<br> this book should be taken literally?<br> Everything in the Bible should be<br> accepted exactly as it is given there.<br> What about this part right here,<br> where it talks about Jonah<br> being swallowed by the whale?<br> You figure that really happened?<br> The Bible does not say a whale.<br> It says a big fish.<br> As a matter of fact, it says a great fish.<br> But I guess<br> one's pretty much the same as the other.<br> What do you think about that business?<br> I believe in a God who can make a whale<br> and who can make a man,<br> and make both do what he pleases.<br> God bless you, Matthew Harrison Brady.<br> (crowd) Amen!<br> I want those amens in the record.<br> Now I recollect a story about Joshua,<br> Joshua making the sun stand still.<br> As an expert, do you tell me<br> that's as right as the Jonah business?<br> That's a pretty neat trick.<br> I do not question or scoff at the miracles<br> of the Lord as do ye of little faith.<br> Have you pondered what would happen<br> to the earth if the sun stood still?<br> You can testify to that<br> if I get you on the stand.<br> If, as they say, the sun stood still,<br> they must have some kind of an idea<br> that the sun moved around the earth.<br> Do you think so, or don't you believe<br> the earth moves round the sun?<br> - I have faith in the Bible.<br> - But not much in the solar system.<br> - The sun stopped.<br> - Good.<br> Now, if what you say actually happened,<br> if Joshua stopped the sun in the sky,<br> the earth stopped spinning on its axis.<br> Continents toppled over one another,<br> mountains flew into space,<br> and the earth, shrivelled to a cinder,<br> crashed into the sun.<br> - How come they missed that bit of news?<br> - Because it didn't happen.<br> But it had to happen,<br> according to natural law.<br> Or don't you believe in natural law?<br> Would you ban Copernicus from<br> the classroom along with Charles Darwin?<br> Would you pass a law throwing out<br> all scientific knowledge<br> since Joshua, Revelations, period?<br> Natural law was born in the mind<br> of the heavenly Father.<br> He can change it, cancel it, as he pleases.<br> It constantly amazes me that you apostles<br> of science, for all your supposed wisdom,<br> fail to grasp this simple fact.<br> Now, listen to this.<br> This is Genesis, 4 to 16.<br> "And Cain went out<br> from the presence of the Lord<br> and dwelt in the Land of Nod,<br> on the east of Eden."<br> "And Cain knew his wife."<br> Now, where the hell did she come from?<br> - Who?<br> - Mrs Cain. Cain's wife.<br> If in the beginning there were<br> Cain and Abel and Adam and Eve,<br> where did this extra woman come from?<br> Did you ever stop to think about that?<br> No, sir.<br> I leave the agnostics to hunt for her.<br> (laughter)<br> - Never bothered you?<br> - Never bothered me.<br> - Never tried to find out?<br> - No.<br> Somebody else pulled<br> another creation in the next county?<br> The Bible satisfies me. It is enough.<br> It frightens me to think<br> of the state of learning in the world<br> if everybody had your driving curiosity.<br> Now, this book goes into a lot of "begats".<br> "And Arphaxad begat Salah;<br> and Salah begat Eber."<br> And so on and so on and so on.<br> Are these pretty important people?<br> They are the generations<br> of the holy men and women of the Bible.<br> - How did they go about all this begatting?<br> - What do you mean?<br> I mean did they begat in much the same<br> way as folks get themselves begat today?<br> The process is about the same.<br> I don't think your scientists<br> have improved it any.<br> (laughter followed by gavel)<br> In other words, all of these folks<br> were conceived and brought forth<br> by the normal biological function<br> known as sex?<br> What do you think of sex, Colonel Brady?<br> In what spirit is this question asked?<br> Well, I'm not asking you what<br> you think of sex as a father,<br> as a husband or even as<br> a presidential candidate.<br> You're up here as an expert on the Bible.<br> What is the biblical evaluation of sex?<br> It is considered original sin.<br> And all these holy people got<br> themselves begat through original sin?<br> Well, all that sinning<br> make 'em any less holy?<br> Where is this leading us? What has it to<br> do with the State versus Bertram Cates?<br> The court must be satisfied that this<br> questioning has a bearing on the case.<br> You've ruled out my witnesses.<br> You must allow me to examine<br> my one witness in my own way.<br> Your Honour, I am willing to sit here<br> and endure Mr Drummond's sneering<br> and his disrespect.<br> For he is pleading the prosecution's case<br> by his contempt for all that is holy.<br> I object, I object, I object!<br> On what grounds?<br> Is it possible that something is holy<br> to the celebrated agnostic?<br> Yes.<br> The individual human mind.<br> In a child's power<br> to master the multiplication table<br> there is more sanctity<br> than in all your shouted amens<br> and holy holies and hosannas.<br> An idea is a greater monument<br> than a cathedral.<br> And the advance of man's knowledge<br> is a greater miracle<br> than all the sticks turned to snakes<br> or the parting of the waters.<br> But now are we to forgo all this progress<br> because Mr Brady<br> now frightens us with a fable?<br> Gentlemen, progress has never been<br> a bargain. You have to pay for it.<br> Sometimes I think there's a man<br> behind a counter who says:<br> "You can have a telephone but you lose<br> privacy and the charm of distance."<br> "Madam, you may vote, but at a price."<br> "You lose the right to retreat behind<br> the powder puff or your petticoat."<br> "Mister, you may conquer the air,<br> but the birds will lose their wonder<br> and the clouds will smell of gasoline."<br> Darwin took us forward to a hilltop,<br> from where we could see<br> the way from which we came.<br> But for this insight<br> and for this knowledge,<br> we must abandon our faith<br> in the pleasant poetry of Genesis.<br> We must not abandon faith!<br> Faith is the most important thing!<br> Then why did God plague us<br> with the power to think?<br> Mr Brady,<br> why do you deny the one faculty of man<br> that raises him<br> above the other creatures of the earth?<br> The power of his brain to reason.<br> What other merit have we?<br> The elephant is larger.<br> The horse is swifter and stronger.<br> The butterfly is far more beautiful.<br> The mosquito is more prolific.<br> Even the simple sponge is more durable.<br> Or does a sponge think?<br> I don't know. I am a man, not a sponge.<br> (laughter)<br> Do you think a sponge thinks?<br> If the Lord wishes a sponge to think,<br> it thinks.<br> Do you think a man should have<br> the same privilege as a sponge?<br> Of course.<br> This man wishes to be accorded<br> the same privilege as a sponge.<br> He wishes to think.<br> (gavel)<br> But your client is wrong.<br> He is deluded. He has lost his way.<br> It's sad we don't all have your positive<br> knowledge of what is right and wrong.<br> How old do you think this rock is?<br> I am more interested in the rock of ages<br> than I am in the age of rocks.<br> Dr Page tells me<br> this rock is at least ten million years old.<br> Well, well. Colonel Drummond,<br> you managed to sneak in<br> some of that scientific testimony after all.<br> Look, Mr Brady.<br> These are the fossil remains of a marine<br> prehistoric creature found in this county,<br> and which lived here millions of years ago<br> when these mountain were underwater.<br> I know. The Bible gives<br> a fine account of the Flood.<br> But your professor's<br> mixed up on his dates.<br> That rock is not more<br> than 6,000 years old.<br> How do you know?<br> A fine biblical scholar, Bishop Ussher,<br> has determined for us<br> the exact date and hour of the Creation.<br> It occurred in the year 4004 BC.<br> Well, that's Bishop Ussher's opinion.<br> It's not an opinion. It's a fact, which the<br> bishop arrived at through computation<br> of the ages of the prophets<br> as set down in the Old Testament.<br> In fact, he determined that the Lord began<br> the Creation on 23rd October, 4004 BC,<br> at 9am.<br> Is that Eastern Standard Time?<br> Or Rocky Mountain Time?<br> It wasn't Daylight Saving Time, the Lord<br> didn't make the sun until the fourth day.<br> That is correct.<br> That first day, what do you think it was?<br> - The Bible says it was a day.<br> - There was no sun.<br> How do you know how long it was?<br> - The Bible says it was a day.<br> - A normal day, a literal day, 24-hour day?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What do you think?<br> I do not think<br> about things I do not think about.<br> Do you ever think about things<br> that you do think about?<br> Isn't it possible that<br> it could have been 25 hours?<br> There's no way to measure it,<br> no way to tell.<br> - Could it have been 25 hours?<br> - It's possible.<br> Then you interpret that the first day,<br> as recorded in the Book of Genesis, could<br> have been a day of indeterminate length?<br> I mean to state that<br> it is not necessarily a 24-hour day.<br> It could have been 3O hours.<br> Could have been a week.<br> Could have been a month.<br> Could have been a year, 100 years.<br> Or it could have been ten million years.<br> I protest! This is not only<br> irrelevant, immaterial, it is illegal!<br> I demand to know the purpose<br> of Mr Drummond's examination.<br> He wants to destroy everybody's belief<br> in the Bible and in God.<br> That's not true and you know it.<br> The Bible is a book. It's a good book.<br> But it is not the only book.<br> It the revealed word of the Almighty God,<br> spake to the men who wrote the Bible.<br> How do you know<br> God didn't spake to Charles Darwin?<br> I know because God tells me<br> to oppose the evil teachings of that man.<br> God speaks to you? He tells you what<br> is right and wrong? You act accordingly?<br> So you, Matthew Harrison Brady,<br> through oratory or legislature or whatever,<br> you pass on God's orders<br> to the rest of the world!<br> Well, meet the prophet from Nebraska!<br> - I... Please!<br> - Is that the way of things?<br> God tells Brady what is good.<br> To be against Brady is to be against God.<br> No! Each man is a free agent.<br> Then what is Bertram Cates<br> doing in the Hillsboro jail?<br> Supposing Mr Cates<br> had the influence and the lung power<br> to railroad through the state legislature<br> a law saying only Darwin<br> could be taught in school.<br> Ridiculous. Ridiculous.<br> There is only one great truth in the world.<br> The Gospel.<br> The Gospel according to Brady!<br> God speaks to Brady<br> and Brady tells the world!<br> - Brady, Brady, Brady Almighty!<br> - The Lord is my strength!<br> Suppose that a lesser human being,<br> suppose a Cates or a Darwin,<br> had the audacity to think<br> that God might whisper to him,<br> that an un-Brady thought<br> might still be holy.<br> Must a man go to prison because he<br> differs with the self-appointed prophet?<br> Extend the testaments.<br> Let us have a Book of Brady.<br> We shall hex the Pentateuch and slip you<br> in between Numbers and Deuteronomy.<br> - My friends, Your Honour...<br> - The witness is excused!<br> All of you know what I stand for,<br> what I believe.<br> I believe in the truth of the Book<br> of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,<br> Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,<br> First Samuel, Second Samuel,<br> First Kings, Second Kings,<br> Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel...<br> Court is adjourned<br> until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.<br> Matt. Matt, dear.<br> Let's go home.<br> - Home?<br> - Back to the hotel.<br> (knocking)<br> Who is it?<br> - Where is he? I've got to talk to him.<br> - Not now. He isn't feeling well.<br> - Now. He must tell Bert it wasn't my fault.<br> - Please be quiet. He's sleeping.<br> Why should I be quiet? I want the world<br> to know Matthew Harrison Brady is a fake.<br> Rachel!<br> I'm sorry.<br> I found myself in bed today,<br> in the middle of the day.<br> I was dreaming I was in the witness chair,<br> chained to it.<br> I kept begging him to let me go.<br> Rachel, it's been a nightmare for us all.<br> But mine was real.<br> I turned to your husband for help.<br> He encouraged me to open up my heart<br> to him and then he twisted my words.<br> He tricked me. Why? Why did he do it?<br> I don't know. I don't know why he did it.<br> Maybe it meant too much to him.<br> Maybe he was tired or afraid.<br> I taught my pupils that<br> Matthew Harrison Brady was a great man.<br> Next to God, almost.<br> What do you want me to teach them now?<br> - He's still the same man.<br> - No.<br> If he could do such an evil thing,<br> then he must be an evil man.<br> - And all he stands for must be evil too.<br> - Oh, stop it! Stop it!<br> Youth can be so pure.<br> What do you know of good or evil?<br> What do you understand<br> of the sum of a man's life?<br> - He betrayed me.<br> - You betrayed yourself.<br> You see my husband as a saint,<br> and so he must be right<br> in everything he says and does.<br> Then you see him as a devil,<br> and everything he says and does<br> must be wrong.<br> Well, my husband's<br> neither a saint nor a devil.<br> He's just a human being<br> and he makes mistakes.<br> - How can you defend him?<br> - It's not he I'm defending.<br> I'm defending the 40 years<br> I've lived with this man<br> and watched him<br> carry the burdens of people like you.<br> If he's been wrong, at least he stood<br> for something. What do you stand for?<br> Do you believe in Bertram Cates?<br> I believe in my husband.<br> What do you believe in?<br> Matt.<br> I was asleep, but...<br> What can I do for you, child?<br> I'm not your child any longer, Mr Brady.<br> Yours... or anyone else's.<br> What...<br> What did she want, Sarah?<br> She's been hurt, Matt.<br> You hurt her.<br> Oh, Matt, you were always a good man.<br> That's why I loved you,<br> even from the very beginning.<br> People have said you made mistakes,<br> wrong decisions.<br> You could have been president<br> three times over.<br> But I never doubted you, Matt.<br> Because your decisions were honest. You<br> never sacrificed your principles to win.<br> I didn't mean to hurt her.<br> Sarah,<br> a victory here would be a monument<br> to God that would last 1,000 years.<br> But, Matt, every man<br> has to build his own monument.<br> You can't do it for them.<br> If you do,<br> it becomes your monument, not theirs.<br> And they'll topple it<br> the minute they find a flaw in it.<br> You mean a flaw in me, don't you, Sarah?<br> They turned away from you<br> this afternoon.<br> Oh, they didn't understand.<br> But I'll make them understand.<br> They'll have to understand.<br> My speech. Where's my speech?<br> Matt.<br> I'll make them listen. Where's my speech?<br> I'll make them understand.<br> - Please don't get excited.<br> - Here it is. I have it all down on paper.<br> Sarah, it isn't just this case.<br> It's God himself that's on trial.<br> They'll have to listen to me.<br> They will listen to me.<br> They'll listen, dear.<br> - Mother, they laughed at me.<br> - Shh, baby.<br> I can't stand it when they laugh at me.<br> It's all right, baby. It's all right.<br> - They laughed.<br> - Baby.<br> Baby.<br> (clears throat)<br> Testing, testing. One, two, three, four.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> Testing. Testing. One, two, three, four.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> You've brought me<br> some more clean shirts?<br> Bert,<br> I left my father.<br> I messed things up<br> pretty badly for us, didn't I?<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> Brady can twist things...<br> It wasn't his fault.<br> I should have done this<br> in the beginning. I want...<br> Rach.<br> You don't have to say it.<br> I'm just glad you're here.<br> Come on, you sit down.<br> Well. Welcome back to our side,<br> Miss Brown.<br> - What's that?<br> - Enunciator.<br> - Do you want to broadcast?<br> - We got a direct wire to WGN Chicago.<br> As soon as the jury returns,<br> we'll broadcast the verdict.<br> Radio. God, that's gonna<br> break down a lot of walls.<br> - You're not supposed to say "God".<br> - Why the hell not?<br> You're not supposed to say "hell".<br> This is going to be<br> a barren source of amusement.<br> Hello, Colonel.<br> There's a little toy you'll never<br> have any use for. Not with your lungs.<br> - What?<br> - The radio.<br> You whisper into it and it shouts<br> at a million people through loudspeakers.<br> Get rid of this.<br> What do you think?<br> Can you tell from their faces?<br> Everybody rise. Hear ye, hear ye!<br> Court will reconvene in the case of<br> the State versus Bertram Cates.<br> All right. Go ahead.<br> This is Harry Esterbrook, speaking to you<br> from the courthouse in Hillsboro,<br> where the jury has just returned in<br> the historic Hillsboro Monkey Trial case.<br> The judge has taken the bench.<br> Soon we will know whether Cates<br> will be found innocent or guilty.<br> I wish I could describe the tension<br> in this courtroom today.<br> - One moment, please.<br> - Please stand by.<br> I've been on the phone<br> with the lieutenant governor all morning.<br> The newspapers<br> haven't been very kind to us.<br> The boys at the Capitol think it wouldn't<br> do any harm if you let this simmer down.<br> Wait, Jason.<br> I have an obligation to the law.<br> Of course you have, Merle, but don't<br> forget... November's not too far off.<br> (clears throat)<br> Gentlemen of the jury,<br> have you reached a verdict?<br> Yes, sir... Uh, Your Honour, we have.<br> The verdict of the jury is unanimous.<br> Bertram Cates is found guilty as charged.<br> You have heard the verdict of the jury<br> as read by presiding Judge Coffey.<br> Bertram Cates, defendant in one of<br> the greatest ethical contests known to us,<br> Bertram Cates has been found guilty.<br> The law has been satisfied.<br> But what repercussions of what happened<br> will be known only to the future.<br> - Quiet, please. Order.<br> - Stand by, please.<br> This court is still in session.<br> You remove that now, please.<br> The prisoner will rise<br> to hear the sentence of this court.<br> Bert, do you wish to make any statement<br> before sentence is passed?<br> Your Honour, I'm not a public speaker.<br> I do not have the eloquence of some of<br> the men you've heard in the last few days.<br> - I'm just a schoolteacher.<br> - Not any more, you ain't!<br> (booing followed by gavel)<br> I was a schoolteacher.<br> I feel that...<br> I've been convicted<br> of violating an unjust law.<br> I will continue in the future,<br> as I have in the past,<br> to oppose this law in any way I can.<br> Bertram Cates, this court has found you<br> guilty of violating public act volume 37,<br> statute 31428, as charged.<br> This violation is punishable<br> by fine and/or imprisonment.<br> But, since there has been<br> no previous violation of this statute,<br> there's no precedent<br> to guide the bench passing sentence.<br> The court deems it proper...<br> to sentence Bertram Cates<br> to pay a fine of... (clears throat)<br> one hundred dollars.<br> (shouting and applause)<br> But, uh... Uh, did, uh...<br> Did Your Honour say<br> one hundred dollars?<br> That is correct.<br> That seems to conclude the trial.<br> But the prosecution takes exception.<br> Where the issues are so titanic, the court<br> must mete out more drastic punishment.<br> - I object.<br> - To make an example of the transgressor.<br> - To show the world...<br> - Just a minute.<br> The amount of the fine<br> is of no concern to me.<br> Bertram Cates has no intention<br> of paying this or any other fine.<br> If it were one single dollar<br> he would not pay it.<br> We are going to appeal this decision<br> to the state supreme court.<br> Will the court grant us 3O days<br> in which to prepare the appeal?<br> Granted. Court fixes bond at $200.<br> I believe that concludes the business<br> of this trial. I declare this court adjourn...<br> Your Honour! With the court's permission,<br> I should like to read into the record<br> a few short remarks.<br> I object to that.<br> Mr Brady is free to read any remarks<br> in a chautauqua or political campaign,<br> but our business<br> in Hillsboro is completed.<br> - The defence moves that we adjourn.<br> - But I have a few remarks.<br> (judge) And we are all anxious<br> to hear them, sir.<br> But Colonel Drummond's<br> point of procedure is well taken.<br> I'm sure everyone will wish to remain<br> after we adjourn to hear your address.<br> I hereby declare<br> this court is adjourned sine die.<br> My friends! My dear friends!<br> Your attention, please!<br> Fellow citizens<br> and friends of the unseen audience,<br> from the hallowed hills of sacred Sinai<br> in the days of antiquity came a law<br> which has been<br> our bulwark and our shield.<br> Age upon age, men have looked to<br> the law as they would to the mountains.<br> And here, here in this courtroom...<br> Here in this courtroom. Oh, no. No.<br> ...as they would look to the mountains<br> whence cometh our strength.<br> From time remembered, wherever man's<br> body has known hunger and oppression,<br> lost in darkness and despair, and here,<br> here in this courtroom living still,<br> in spite of dungeon, fire and sword...<br> Eskimo pies! Five cents, Eskimo pies.<br> When he set fire...<br> Eskimo pies, sweet as honey.<br> Here's where you bring your money.<br> Eskimo pies.<br> ...lighting his way to everlasting salvation.<br> He would rob them of their creator<br> and their hope of heaven.<br> From the hallowed hills of sacred Sinai<br> in the days of antiquity came the law<br> which has been our bulwark and shield.<br> And here, here in this courtroom,<br> we have seen vindicated<br> the faith of our fathers,<br> living still in spite of<br> dungeon, fire and sword.<br> Our hearts beat high with joy<br> whenever we hear that glorious word.<br> Faith of our fathers, holy faith,<br> we will be true to thee...<br> till death.<br> (breathes heavily)<br> Matt! Matt!<br> - Oh, dear God in heaven! Matt!<br> - Get back.<br> O Lord, pass us a miracle<br> and save our holy prophet!<br> (man) Get a doctor!<br> (Drummond) I cannot imagine the world<br> without Matthew Harrison Brady.<br> Get me the Baltimore Herald.<br> - What did he die of? Did they say?<br> - He died of a busted belly.<br> There was much greatness in the man.<br> Can I quote you in the obituary?<br> Write anything you dare.<br> Write anything you please.<br> How do you write an obituary<br> for a man who's been dead 3O years?<br> Operator?<br> Say, what did he say to the minister?<br> You know, that fits.<br> He delivered his own obituary.<br> Where did you put that...<br> Ah, here it is.<br> His book.<br> It was Proverbs, wasn't it?<br> "He that troubleth his own house<br> shall inherit the wind."<br> "And the fool<br> shall be servant to the wise in heart."<br> Wow!<br> Well, Colonel Drummond, we're growing<br> an odd crop of agnostics this year.<br> You know, Hornbeck,<br> I'm getting damned sick of you.<br> Why?<br> You never pushed a noun against a verb<br> except to blow up something.<br> You know, that's a typical lawyer's trick,<br> accusing the accuser.<br> - What am I accused of?<br> - Contempt of conscience.<br> Sentimentality in the first degree.<br> Why? Because I refuse<br> to erase a man's lifetime?<br> No. You know what I thought of him<br> and I know what you thought,<br> so let's leave the lamentations<br> to the illiterate.<br> What is this? Be Kind To Bigots Week?<br> Why should we weep for him?<br> Because he's dead? Oh, no.<br> He cried enough for himself<br> during his lifetime.<br> The national tear duct<br> from Weeping Water, Nebraska.<br> He flooded the nation<br> like a one-man Mississippi.<br> You know what he was,<br> that Bible-beating bunko artist.<br> A giant once lived in that body.<br> But Matt Brady got lost because he looked<br> for God too high up and too far away.<br> Why, you hypocrite!
