                        The 24th of August, 1936.<br> ngel Beach, California, U.S.A.<br> The world, the universe. ngel Beach.<br> I'm 15 today,<br> but I won't let it go to my head.<br> I'm still the same happy, adjusted,<br> polite young lady.<br> People say<br> I'm quite sophisticated for my age.<br> That's only skin deep.<br> Underneath the veneer...<br> ...I'll bet my simple healthy instincts<br> against yours any day.<br> Look, Mrs. Clover,<br> were there any distinguishing marks?<br> I never heard of a distinguishing mark.<br> It's anything special about a person<br> like a scar or a missing tooth.<br> - Where you been? You had your breakfast?<br> - Yeah.<br> - This your daughter?<br> - Well, it's not my mother.<br> Mr. Clover never lost a tooth.<br> Your mother called us<br> to report the sad news about your father.<br> Does Mr. Clover often fail to come home?<br> It's too long ago to remember.<br> I haven't seen him in seven years.<br> You waited seven years<br> to report your husband's disappearance?<br> I only started to miss him this morning.<br> Human nature.<br> Photographs never did him justice,<br> but he looked exactly like this.<br> Okay, Mrs. Clover, you've had your fun.<br> Yeah, well, I certainly have not.<br> He's got a button missing.<br> Hey, how long<br> has your mother been like this?<br> Like what?<br> Like that.<br> The Dealer's been a little moody<br> since Mr. Clover took a powder, that's all.<br> - The Dealer?<br> - The Old Chap.<br> I call her The Dealer<br> because she plays a lot of cards.<br> - Well, that's no way to live.<br> - Oh, live and let live.<br> What do you do for money?<br> Mr. Clover left us some government bonds.<br> Plus his gold cuff links by mistake.<br> - What was your father's profession?<br> - He invented things.<br> What things?<br> Oh, like musical earrings, you know.<br> He got the idea from cowbells.<br> That one never caught on.<br> I'd better figure out<br> what kind of report to make.<br> Hey, wait.<br> Listen, take my advice<br> and drop the whole thing.<br> It's no good asking Daisy questions.<br> She doesn't remember as well as I do.<br> The cards are giving me nothing<br> but trouble this morning.<br> Hey, Old Chap?<br> After all this time,<br> you really want that old joker back?<br> Maybe I do, maybe I don't.<br> It's none of his business.<br> - Some people got no imagination!<br> - Yeah.<br> Milton.<br> Hey.<br> - You stinking sneak.<br> Daisy.<br> - You stinking sneak.<br> How is business?<br> Like to buy me out?<br> My folks get back from Hawaii tomorrow.<br> You said that yesterday.<br> I forgot about the time belt.<br> You gotta come down to the store and see<br> that Victorian brass bedstead we got.<br> It's fantastic.<br> - I can see it when your folks get back.<br> - You said that yesterday.<br> Daisy, dear,<br> when can I expect my Myrna Loy?<br> Oh, she just came in.<br> Milton, why don't you keep busy<br> in the summer vacation like I do.<br> Get your mind off it.<br> I helped my father move furniture<br> around the store for a whole month.<br> But it didn't take my mind off it.<br> Nothing takes my mind off of it.<br> Here she is.<br> You know,<br> even our handwriting's the same.<br> - Thanks, Daisy.<br> - Okay.<br> "'I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good. '<br> Daisy Clover. "<br> Oh!<br> You sing?<br> What's the matter?<br> Wanna be a singer or something?<br> What's the matter with wanting<br> to be a singer or something?<br> Don't you want to be anything?<br> I'm gonna be kept<br> by some rich older dame.<br> - It happens if you're good at it.<br> - Then get to work.<br> Daisy, what are you doing in there?<br> - I'm frying up fish burgers.<br> I got beans and hot chocolate too.<br> It's my birthday,<br> and I want a party, damn it.<br> Stay off those four-letter words.<br> There's too many of them around.<br> - Try and concentrate. It's my birthday.<br> - You take an awful lot for granted.<br> Well, the 24th of August<br> has always been my birthday.<br> - That's your story.<br> - You got a better one?<br> - I have never heard of such a thing.<br> - What?<br> Your sister, Gloria,<br> ought to be ashamed of herself.<br> If it's your birthday, she's forgot it.<br> Well, I certainly intend to forget hers.<br> Oh, the hell with Gloria's birthday,<br> it's my birthday.<br> Yeah, well...<br> Come on, Old Chap.<br> Pull yourself together, huh?<br> Try to get in a party mood.<br> We're gonna eat and cut up.<br> We'll take a walk along the beach. We'll<br> treat ourselves to a sweet sherry or two.<br> Maybe we'll call up Gloria<br> and give her the bird, okay?<br> Hey. Old Chap?<br> Hey!<br> Your mother just drew the ace of spades.<br> Her number may be up.<br> I'll let you know.<br> One.<br> Two.<br> Three.<br> Four. Five.<br> Close the door.<br> - Huh?<br> Close that door.<br> Something is very wrong.<br> There's a hearse outside.<br> And I got an insulting telegram.<br> Who from?<br> Some smart aleck asking me<br> to present myself for an interview.<br> I never give interviews.<br> - Where's the telegram?<br> - I threw it away.<br> No point in keeping trash like that around.<br> Daisy, I wish you'd send that hearse away.<br> Hey. Hey, you. I'll be right out. Wait.<br> Try and concentrate.<br> I got something to explain.<br> I can sing.<br> I open up my mouth,<br> and a song comes out.<br> - You ought to be in school.<br> - Try and concentrate.<br> I got an appointment<br> with Mr. Raymond Swan, see?<br> They said in the newspapers<br> that he was running this talent contest.<br> So I recorded my voice,<br> and I sent it to him.<br> Who is this joker? Some cop?<br> No, it's got nothing to do with the cops.<br> It's Mr. Raymond Swan. It's the movies.<br> Oh, I never go to them.<br> That hearse is still outside.<br> Go away, go away.<br> It's going away, Old Chap. With me in it.<br> You shouldn't accept rides<br> from strangers.<br> They take you to a foreign country.<br> They leave you there.<br> - Hi. I know, but I'm late.<br> - You never hear from them again.<br> There ought to be a law against it.<br> Wish me luck.<br> I'm gonna make a noise in the world.<br> Send me a postcard. If you get there.<br> Follow me.<br> What's your name?<br> Daisy Clover.<br> - What do you want to see me about?<br> - I thought you wanted to see me.<br> You sent me a telegram and a limousine.<br> I sent you a record with my voice on it.<br> Who taught you to sing?<br> No one.<br> Will you take your hand away<br> from your face?<br> All right, tell me why you sing.<br> - Why shouldn't I?<br> - Well, don't you know it's bad for you?<br> Huh?<br> Oh, yes, singers breathe out more air<br> than they breathe in.<br> Especially when they sing loud like you.<br> They get too much carbon dioxide.<br> It makes them jittery,<br> they start seeing things.<br> I can't see anything.<br> I didn't ask you that.<br> I asked you why you sing.<br> My mother says<br> this world's a garbage dump.<br> And we're just the flies it attracts.<br> Maybe she's right.<br> But when I sing,<br> the smell doesn't seem so bad.<br> I don't like your hair.<br> I think she looks charming.<br> Wonderful eyes.<br> Ray, won't you turn off<br> that horrible light?<br> This is my wife, Miss...?<br> - Clover.<br> My name is Melora.<br> Did you come here all by yourself?<br> I call that very brave.<br> Well, my mother's a little bit<br> under the weather today.<br> Tell me about the rest of your family.<br> My father took a powder.<br> So did my sister, Gloria.<br> She went off<br> and married some guy in real estate.<br> Stand up for Mrs. Swan, please.<br> Smile.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> I presume you can spare us<br> a little of your time today?<br> Everyone tells me to know my place<br> But that ain't the way I play<br> Why am I daring to show my face?<br> Because I've got something to say<br> Move over sun<br> And give me some sky<br> I've got me some wings<br> I'm eager to try<br> I may be unknown<br> But wait till I've flown<br> You're gonna hear from me<br> Make me some room<br> You people up there<br> On top of the world<br> I'll meet you, I swear<br> I'm staking my claim<br> Remember my name<br> You're gonna hear from me<br> Fortune smile<br> On the road before me<br> I'm fortune's child<br> Listen, world, you can't ignore me<br> I've got a song<br> That longs to be played<br> Raise up my flag, begin my parade<br> Then watch the world over<br> Start coming up, Clover<br> That's how it's gonna be<br> You'll see<br> You're gonna hear from me<br> All right, cut.<br> A little more.<br> Now did that seem<br> to block it down pretty well?<br> Right, quite hot.<br> We were trying to get that<br> hot spot right behind the girl's head.<br> You hit the same spot.<br> Yeah.<br> I can't.<br> Good enough.<br> You're in a dreadful mood.<br> I told you,<br> never accept rides from strangers.<br> All right, it's your birthday.<br> Last week, you wanted a birthday.<br> You live in a world of your own.<br> That's your trouble.<br> Don't go yet. Don't go away.<br> Old Chap, try and concentrate.<br> It's not the cops or the funeral home,<br> it's the movies.<br> It's your sister.

You report<br> to work next week. Mm-hm.<br> Incredible as it may seem,<br> I'm gonna make something out of you.<br> - What?<br> - Money. There's a certain mixture...<br> ...of orphan and clown<br> that always packs them in.<br> It's got a dirty face, heart of gold,<br> and it sings.<br> It doesn't smoke, or bite its fingernails,<br> or cut its hair without permission.<br> It becomes America's Little Valentine.<br> And it goes to the top of the tree.<br> Oh! Whoa!<br> We're on fire. Help, help.<br> - Mother needs help.<br> Help.<br> Help, help.<br> No, no, baby, you can't.<br> - Let me go, let me go.<br> Mother was always a cannon.<br> - Baby, you can't go in there, no.<br> Let me go.<br> No, baby,<br> sister is just looking out for you.<br> Please.
