                        Mom!<br> Mom! Help me.<br> What is it?<br> I wasn't dreaming, Walt.<br> I didn't imagine it.<br> I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.<br> I heard Chris.<br> - I heard him!<br> - I know.<br> No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.<br> No, I did. He's... He's...<br> - I heard him!<br> - Billie.<br> That's about as far as I can get you.<br> All right. Thank you.<br> - You left all your shit on my dash.<br> - Keep it.<br> Suit yourself.<br> Thanks again.<br> Hey, hold on a minute.<br> Here, take these.<br> They'll keep your feet dry.<br> If you make it out alive, give me a call.<br> My number's inside the boots.<br> Thanks.<br> Hello?<br> Is there anybody here?<br> Guess not!<br> Two years he walks the earth.<br> No phone, no pool, no pets,<br> no cigarettes.<br> Ultimate freedom.<br> An extremist. An aesthetic voyager<br> whose home is the road.<br> "Hey, listen, old man.<br> Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?<br> "Shut up.<br> I'm taking you out to where we're going."<br> "Where you going?"<br> "I told you. We're going nowhere!"<br> So now, after two rambling years<br> comes the final and greatest adventure.<br> The climactic battle to kill<br> the false being within<br> and victoriously conclude<br> the spiritual revolution.<br> No longer to be poisoned<br> by civilization, he flees,<br> and walks alone<br> upon the land to become<br> lost in the wild.<br> ... hard work and manifold contributions<br> to our community during their time here,<br> we salute you and offer all of you<br> one more round of applause<br> and congratulations.<br> Nina Lynn Lockwynn.<br> Vanessa Denise Lowery.<br> Christopher Johnson McCandless.<br> Regina Victoria McNabb.<br> I see them standing at the formal gates<br> of their colleges.<br> I see my father strolling out<br> under the ochre sandstone arch,<br> the red tiles glinting like bent plates<br> of blood behind his head.<br> I see my mother<br> with a few light books at her hip,<br> standing at the pillar made of tiny<br> bricks with the wrought-iron gates<br> still open behind her,<br> its sword-tips black in the May air.<br> They are about to graduate.<br> They are about to get married.<br> They are kids. They are dumb.<br> All they know is they are innocent,<br> they would never hurt anybody.<br> I want to go up to them and say,<br> "Stop, don't do it.<br> "She's the wrong woman,<br> he's the wrong man.<br> "You are going to do things<br> you cannot imagine you would ever do.<br> "You are going to do bad things<br> to children.<br> "You are going to suffer<br> in ways you never heard of.<br> "You are going to want to die."<br> I want to go up to them there<br> in the late May sunlight and say it.<br> But I don't do it. I want to live.<br> I take them up like the male and female<br> paper dolls, and bang them together<br> at the hips like chips of flint, as if<br> to strike sparks from them. I say,<br> "Do what you are going to do<br> and I will tell about it."<br> Here they are, Walt. Okay?<br> Who wrote that?<br> Well, could have been either one of us,<br> couldn't it?<br> Why is he letting Carine drive his car?<br> There's a lot of great poems in here.<br> I have to speak to her about it.<br> Sit down.<br> Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.<br> He just graduated today<br> from Emory College.<br> I'll get it. I'll get it.<br> Chris, hi!<br> We've been waiting and waiting.<br> You scared me half to death<br> jumping up there on that stage like that.<br> - Hi, Dad.<br> - Congratulations, Son.<br> - This is a big step.<br> - Thank you, Dad.<br> All right.<br> You're not supposed to be driving<br> in Georgia.<br> Why? I have my permit.<br> 'Cause it's against the law<br> for a learner's permit<br> to drive in another state<br> from one's home state. That's why.<br> I didn't know that. I thought that if I was<br> with a legal driver that it'd be okay.<br> Well, let's...<br> - Are they going to continue?<br> - No.<br> I guess everybody's celebrating today.<br> - They're going to stay in the bar, right?<br> - That's right.<br> My grades are good enough, I think,<br> to get into Harvard Law.<br> Chris, that's wonderful.<br> That is a big deal.<br> How much do you have left<br> in the college fund?<br> Exactly $24,500.68.<br> Well, that's specific.<br> I had to go to the bank<br> this morning, Mom.<br> Your mother and I will be glad<br> to contribute the balance for Harvard.<br> That's right.<br> I've got to figure out<br> what I'm going to do.<br> I've got a lot of things<br> to pack and organize here first.<br> Your father and I,<br> we want to make a present to you.<br> We want to get you out of that junker.<br> What junker?<br> That.<br> - We want to buy you a new car.<br> - That's right.<br> A new car?<br> Why would I want a new car?<br> Datsun runs great.<br> Do you think I want some fancy boat?<br> Are you worried<br> what the neighbors might think?<br> Well, we weren't gonna get you<br> a brand new Cadillac, Chris.<br> We just want to get you a nice new car<br> that's safe to drive.<br> And you never know when that thing<br> out there just might blow up.<br> Blow up. Blow up?<br> Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.<br> I don't need a new car.<br> I don't want a new car.<br> - I don't want anything.<br> - Okay.<br> - These things, things, things, things.<br> - Okay.<br> - Everything has to be difficult.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Maybe that's not what he means.<br> Maybe he just wants his old car.<br> It's not such a big deal.<br> Thank you. I just don't want anything.<br> Chris measured himself<br> and those around him<br> by a fiercely rigorous moral code.<br> Bye, Chris!<br> He risked what could have been<br> a relentlessly lonely path<br> but found company<br> in the characters of the books he loved<br> from writers like Tolstoy,<br> Jack London and Thoreau.<br> He could summon their words<br> to suit any occasion,<br> and he often would.<br> I forgot to ask what quote he'd have<br> picked for his graduation dinner,<br> but I had a good idea<br> of who the primary target would be.<br> It was inevitable<br> that Chris would break away.<br> And when he did, he would do it<br> with characteristic immoderation.<br> "It should not be denied that being<br> footloose has always exhilarated us.<br> "It is associated in our minds<br> with escape<br> "from history and oppression and law<br> and irksome obligations.<br> "Absolute freedom.<br> "And the road has always led west."<br> I need a name.<br> Toward the end of June,<br> Emory had mailed our parents<br> Chris' final grade report.<br> Almost all A's.<br> A in Apartheid in South African Society.<br> A- minus in Contemporary African<br> Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa.<br> And on it went. Clever boy, my brother.<br> But by the end of July,<br> we hadn't heard anything from him<br> and my parents<br> were becoming unsettled.<br> Chris had never had a phone,<br> so they decided to drive down<br> to Atlanta and surprise him.<br> When they arrived at the apartment,<br> there was a "For Rent" sign up<br> and the manager said that Chris<br> had moved out at the end of May.<br> Oh, yes. He left two months ago.<br> So when they got home,<br> I had to hand them all the letters that<br> they had sent Chris that summer,<br> which had been returned in a bundle.<br> Chris had arranged for the post office<br> to hold them until August 1st,<br> to buy himself some time.<br> Did you know about this?<br> He didn't say anything.<br> I understood what he was doing.<br> That he had spent four years<br> fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty<br> of graduating from college,<br> and now he was emancipated<br> from that world of abstraction,<br> false security, parents<br> and material excess,<br> the things that cut Chris off<br> from the truth of his existence.<br> Hey!<br> - Hey, man. Step around. Jump in.<br> - Okay, great.<br> We barely saw you there<br> underneath that crazy hat of yours.<br> This door's a little tricky.<br> There you go. Hop in.<br> That's Rainey.<br> - Hi, Rainey.<br> - Yeah, I'm Rainey.<br> - I'm Jan.<br> - Hi. I'm Alex.<br> Alex with the hat on.<br> - Yeah, I know. You said it, man.<br> - Yeah.<br> So you're a leather now.<br> I'm a leather?<br> Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they<br> call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.<br> Technically we're rubber tramps.<br> Because we have a vehicle.<br> - You don't have to push me away.<br> - Come on, please?<br> Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,<br> but he decided to burn all of his money.<br> And why did you do that?<br> I don't need money.<br> Makes people cautious.<br> Come on, Alex.<br> You gotta be a little cautious.<br> I mean, that book of yours is cool<br> and everything,<br> but you can't depend entirely<br> on leaves and berries.<br> I don't know if you want to depend on<br> much more than that.<br> Where are your mom and dad?<br> Living their lies somewhere.<br> You look like a loved kid. Be fair.<br> Fair?<br> You know what I mean.<br> I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.<br> "Rather than love, than money,<br> than faith,<br> "than fame, than fairness,<br> "give me truth."<br> From as long ago<br> as Chris and I could remember,<br> there have been<br> daily bouts of rage in our house.<br> Violence that we were forced<br> to witness. It was very real.<br> But it was also like theater.<br> They cast us as both judges<br> and the accused.<br> And I got you this token,<br> this expensive token.<br> Dad had been the young genius<br> that NASA enlisted to do crucial designs<br> for the American satellite radar systems<br> that would be our answer<br> to the Russian Sputnik.<br> And Mom and he later started up<br> a consulting firm<br> combining her<br> get-up-and-go resourcefulness<br> with his wealth of knowledge.<br> Look at this.<br> But by the time the company<br> actually made its first million,<br> the careerism and money seemed<br> only to embolden their blindness.<br> Thank you very, very much.<br> I remember the first family meeting<br> to let us in on their plans<br> for getting a divorce.<br> They wanted us to choose<br> which of them we'd live with.<br> We cried our eyes out.<br> The divorce never happened,<br> but the battles and the meetings<br> never stopped.<br> It wasn't very long<br> before Chris and I shut off.<br> We'd say "Go ahead.<br> "Get the divorce."<br> Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have<br> dinner and warmth at the same time.<br> Where's Jan going?<br> Well, my friend,<br> all is not well on the hippie front.<br> You're an industrious little fucker,<br> aren't you?<br> Little bit.<br> It's funny how things happen<br> at particular times.<br> I've loved that woman<br> for a lot of years, bro.<br> But, you know, she's got a story.<br> We've been going through this thing,<br> real quiet.<br> So when we ran into you yesterday,<br> this thing that we've been going<br> through real quiet,<br> she's talking about it.<br> You know what I mean?<br> - I think I do.<br> - You think what?<br> Well...<br> Some people feel like<br> they don't deserve love.<br> They walk away quietly<br> into empty spaces,<br> trying to close the gaps to the past.<br> That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!<br> - You're not Jesus, are you?<br> - Look who's talking.<br> You gonna walk across the water<br> and get her back for me, pal?<br> No. I'm afraid of water.<br> Always have been.<br> Something I've gotta get over sometime<br> though, huh? So I will swim in it<br> if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.<br> - Shit, yeah.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Call it carried.<br> - All right.<br> "The sea's only gifts are harsh blows,<br> "and, occasionally,<br> the chance to feel strong.<br> "Now, I don't know much about the sea,<br> "but I do know that<br> that's the way it is here.<br> "And I also know<br> how important it is in life<br> "not necessarily to be strong,<br> but to feel strong,<br> "to measure yourself at least once,<br> "to find yourself at least once in<br> the most ancient of human conditions,<br> "facing the blind, deaf stone alone<br> "with nothing to help you<br> but your hands and your own head."<br> There's a big wave coming!<br> Rainey, I'm freezing!<br> Could you put your arms around me?<br> The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this<br> base down there,<br> and all that's left is this huge grid<br> of concrete foundations, or slabs.<br> - Man, you would dig the Slabs.<br> - You would like it. You would like it.<br> - If you're on the road still.<br> - You'd love it.<br> Fellow travelers.<br> Just living on the cheap under the sun.<br> Can't beat it.<br> Sounds good.<br> If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.<br> - Promise?<br> - I swear to God.<br> Oh, baby. Baby.<br> - Stop it. Wait.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Okay.<br> Let me turn off the light.<br> - He reminded me of...<br> - I know.<br> Such is the way of the world<br> You can never know<br> Just where to put all your faith<br> And how will it grow?<br> Gonna rise up<br> Burning back holes in dark memories<br> Gonna rise up<br> Turning mistakes into gold<br> I mean, you're really good.<br> I mean, you're like<br> any apple I've ever had.<br> I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.<br> You're Superapple.<br> You're so tasty.<br> You're so organic, so natural.<br> You're the apple of my eye.<br> Hey! Such is the passage of time<br> Too fast to fold<br> And suddenly swallowed by signs<br> Lo and behold<br> Gonna rise up<br> Find my direction magnetically<br> Gonna rise up<br> Throw down my ace in the hole<br> In early September, Mom and Dad<br> got a call from the Annandale police<br> notifying them that<br> Chris' abandoned car<br> had been identified<br> by the Arizona Highway Patrol.<br> A group of rare flower hunters<br> stumbled upon it in the desert.<br> There were no signs that<br> Chris had intended to return to it.<br> But there wasn't<br> any evidence of struggle, either.<br> The police thought<br> Chris had chosen to leave it behind<br> and not that it was taken from him.<br> The initial comfort<br> that gave Mom and Dad quickly turned<br> to the realization that Chris<br> was actually trying not to be found.<br> Strong.<br> You can do anything.<br> You can go anywhere.<br> Money, power is an illusion.<br> It's up here.<br> You can be here.<br> Me and you.<br> One, two. No, no, no.<br> Two,<br> three...<br> Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.<br> That's good.<br> - That's your speed right here.<br> - Right.<br> You go too fast,<br> you won't get all the wheat.<br> That's it, straight line, straight line,<br> little straighter.<br> See how you're bearing? Just a little<br> straighter. Now you're a combiner.<br> Wow, look at this view!<br> But keep your eye on the wheat, here.<br> Make sure you're cutting it.<br> You can look back here and see<br> how much is coming out, all right.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - I feel great.<br> Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.<br> Make yourself some money, my friend.<br> I'll see you in a little bit.<br> Okay.<br> Wayne. Where you going?<br> Kevin, you know I love you.<br> I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.<br> - I'm joking with you.<br> - Mind your own business, Wayne!<br> - What are you getting so hostile for?<br> - I don't know.<br> Me and you are on the same side.<br> We're on the same side.<br> - I'm just tired of the teasing a lot.<br> - Kevin, we're on the same side.<br> Let me get some...<br> If I want some vagina, let me get it.<br> - Whoa. He's serious about this.<br> - Let's just play cards.<br> - Can we just play cards?<br> - Let's go, then.<br> $2, $4, $6, just put all the money in.<br> I just wanna see<br> everybody going for broke.<br> - You want to play?<br> - No.<br> - Kevin, what have you got for the week?<br> - I got 260.<br> We're at 260.<br> We're gonna stay right at 260,<br> that's our number.<br> We've got 20,000 pounds.<br> We've got 20,000 pounds<br> we need to get rid of.<br> Maybe just do all that after lunch<br> before we get back into everything else.<br> Can we do the $500 reserves...<br> What do you think about all this?<br> I like all this.<br> I don't think he can do it.<br> Is there a library<br> or bookstore around here<br> where I can get books<br> on hunting and preserving?<br> Anything at all to do with hunting<br> or preserving the meat,<br> smoking it, whatever the hell it is,<br> talk to Kevin over there.<br> That's your man.<br> Outdoorsman. What's your fascination<br> with all that stuff?<br> I'm going to Alaska.<br> Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?<br> Because they do have markets<br> in Alaska.<br> The city of Alaska. Not in Alaska.<br> In the city of Alaska, they have markets.<br> No, man. Alaska, Alaska.<br> I'm gonna be all the way out there,<br> all the way fucking out there.<br> Just on my own.<br> You know, no fucking watch,<br> no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.<br> Just be out there. Just be out there in it.<br> You know, big mountains, rivers,<br> sky, game.<br> Just be out there in it, you know?<br> In the wild.<br> - In the wild.<br> - Just wild.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Just...<br> What are you doing when we're there?<br> Now you're in the wild,<br> what are we doing?<br> You're just living, man.<br> You're just there, in that moment,<br> in that special place and time.<br> Yeah.<br> Maybe when I get back,<br> I can write a book about my travels.<br> Why not?<br> You know,<br> about getting out of this sick society.<br> - Society!<br> - Society!<br> - Society, man!<br> - Society!<br> - Society! Society!<br> - Society!<br> Society, you know! Society!<br> 'Cause you know<br> what I don't understand?<br> I don't understand why people,<br> why every fucking person<br> is so bad to each other so fucking often.<br> It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.<br> Control. All that, the whole spectrum.<br> - Well, it just...<br> - What "people" we talking about?<br> You know, parents, hypocrites,<br> politicians, pricks.<br> This is a mistake.<br> It's a mistake to get too deep<br> into all that kind of stuff.<br> Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,<br> a hell of a young guy.<br> But I promise you this.<br> You're a young guy! Can't be juggling<br> blood and fire all the time!<br> - You've got to just kind of...<br> - Wayne, what are you talking about?<br> - What?<br> - I mean...<br> I'm talking about blood and fire.<br> We're talking about<br> trying to juggle blood and fire.<br> Who are you to be giving advice<br> to anybody anyway?<br> Who am I to be giving advice<br> to anybody?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, it's nice to meet you.<br> - My name is Mr. Happy.<br> - Mr. Happy.<br> And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.<br> - Alex, please.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Sometimes Mr. Happy...<br> Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.<br> But you know when he's happiest?<br> - He's not always happy.<br> - When is he happy?<br> Are you really gonna say that to me?<br> Come on, tell me about it.<br> I am going to say that to you.<br> - Now...<br> - Sit down before you hurt yourself.<br> One thing that you should try<br> to keep your eye on<br> is what happened<br> in the late 1940s in Roswell.<br> When a search of tax records<br> revealed that<br> Chris had given<br> his life savings to charity,<br> Mom and Dad became<br> what Dad called "mobilized."<br> They hired a private investigator and<br> notified law enforcement nationwide,<br> determined to track him down.<br> I just figured he'd be with gypsies,<br> far from the eyes of the law.<br> These are those free satellite TV deals.<br> You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.<br> You're gonna need something.<br> What kind of gun you got?<br> I'm probably gonna get like a.22,<br> I think. A.22 caliber rifle.<br> All right, then.<br> When you get your kill,<br> time is of the essence.<br> Now, the first thing you wanna do<br> is make sure<br> that you got that meat<br> nice and shaved up.<br> And you don't have a lot of time to do<br> this. This is about an hour or two.<br> Depending on the weather. Especially if<br> it's hot, you've got less time to do it.<br> What you do is you want to make sure<br> that them flies don't land on your meat.<br> Because once them flies start<br> shitting out larvae and them maggots,<br> you know, those creepy crawlies,<br> it's too late. It's too late.<br> You got me. You got me.<br> I warned Wayne<br> about them little black boxes.<br> Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.<br> I think you know why we're here.<br> - Impressive turn-out.<br> - Yeah.<br> You mind grabbing that zipper<br> for me there? Thank you.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Sorry, boys.<br> We're gonna have to shut down<br> for a little while.<br> Alex, you come back<br> and work for me any time you want.<br> Gil's got your checks, guys.<br> I shouldn't be away too long.<br> Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.<br> South, kid. You wanna head south.<br> The year Chris graduated high school,<br> he bought the Datsun used<br> and drove it cross-country.<br> He stayed away most of the summer.<br> Come on. The neighbors<br> are gonna be watching, honey.<br> Can you spray it?<br> As soon as I heard he was home,<br> I ran into his room to talk to him.<br> In California,<br> he'd looked up some old family friends.<br> He discovered that our parents' stories<br> of how they fell in love and got married<br> were calculated lies<br> masking an ugly truth.<br> When they met,<br> Dad was already married.<br> And even after Chris was born,<br> Dad had had another son<br> with his first wife, Marcia,<br> to whom he was still legally married.<br> This fact suddenly re-defined<br> Chris and me as bastard children.<br> Dad's arrogance made him conveniently<br> oblivious to the pain he caused.<br> And Mom, in the shame and<br> embarrassment of a young mistress,<br> became his accomplice in deceit.<br> The fragility of crystal is not<br> a weakness but a fineness.<br> My parents understood that<br> a fine crystal glass had to be cared for<br> or it may be shattered.<br> But when it came to my brother,<br> they did not seem to know or care<br> that their course of secret action<br> brought the kind of devastation<br> that could cut them.<br> Their fraudulent marriage<br> and our father's denial of this other son<br> was, for Chris,<br> a murder of every day's truth.<br> He felt his whole life turn,<br> like a river suddenly reversing<br> the direction of its flow,<br> suddenly running uphill.<br> These revelations struck at the core<br> of Chris' sense of identity.<br> They made his entire childhood<br> seem like fiction.<br> Chris never told them he knew<br> and made me promise silence, as well.<br> I can't afford four.<br> Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?<br> Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?<br> Can I help you?<br> Yeah. If I wanted<br> to paddle down the river,<br> where's the best place to launch out of?<br> Hang on a second.<br> "To launch out of?"<br> What's your experience level?<br> - Not much.<br> - Any? Do you have a permit?<br> A permit? Permit for what?<br> You can't paddle down the river<br> without a permit.<br> If you want, you can apply for one here,<br> get some experience,<br> and I'll put you on the wait-list.<br> No, I got this guy in here.<br> We'll figure it out.<br> There's a wait-list<br> to paddle down a river?<br> That's right.<br> - Yeah, it's gonna be...<br> - Well, how long do I have to wait?<br> Yeah, hang on a second.<br> Now, the deal is<br> it's gonna be me and you<br> or it's gonna be me, you and her.<br> Next available is May 17th, 2003.<br> Great. Done. The three of us, then.<br> Twelve years?<br> - What's that?<br> - Twelve years?<br> To paddle down a river.<br> Let me call you back.<br> You can do that,<br> or you can join a commercial raft trip,<br> go with a licensed guide.<br> They may have some<br> last-minute cancellations,<br> but that's gonna cost you $2,000.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Helmet, man!<br> I'm Supertramp!<br> "If we admit that human life<br> can be ruled by reason,<br> "the possibility of life is destroyed."<br> Hello!<br> Hello.<br> Come. Join us.<br> We have hot dogs.<br> - I'm Mads.<br> - Mads?<br> - Mads. Hi.<br> - Mads.<br> - Alex.<br> - Hi, Alex.<br> Hey. I'm Sonja.<br> Hey, Alex.<br> We are from Copenhagen,<br> and you are from the rapids.<br> I am.<br> - You're crazy! You're crazy, man.<br> - My God!<br> Sonja, get away from him. Get away<br> from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.<br> I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.<br> I love this. Don't you love this?<br> You know, this is nature.<br> So where are you going?<br> - I haven't decided yet.<br> - Really?<br> Well, we like it here very much.<br> And it's so good to meet you, man.<br> So good to meet you.<br> You know, we went to Los Angeles,<br> and then we went to Las Vegas.<br> Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.<br> The universe is so good.<br> - The universe is very good.<br> - You know what I mean?<br> - Yeah.<br> - The whole universe.<br> Just the place. The city, she means.<br> Her English is not very good.<br> But then we came here. I don't care<br> if she's a little stupid, but I like her.<br> You know you can actually go<br> all the way down to Mexico from here.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> You can take the kayak,<br> and you can take it all the way around<br> down to Hoover Dam,<br> you can sail around,<br> and then from there you can take<br> the river all the way down to Mexico!<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on, come on!<br> She's so slow sometimes.<br> - Here's the map.<br> - But I like her.<br> - Here. Hoover Dam.<br> - Okay.<br> About 330 kilometers, I think.<br> - Miles?<br> - Yeah, miles, about 200 miles.<br> - Two hundred miles.<br> - Two hundred miles. Yeah, man.<br> You know, I wonder if I could paddle<br> all the way down that<br> into the Gulf of California.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.<br> You know, I will go with you.<br> I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,<br> and then we take the kayak.<br> No, no.<br> We go all the way down into Mexico.<br> You know, because in every man's<br> heart, there is a Mexican mistress.<br> Oh, man.<br> I've gotta go, you guys.<br> I'm really sorry. I gotta go.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Why?<br> The river patrol's after me. I'm actually<br> not supposed to be here, you know.<br> You have to have, like, a permit,<br> it's like a government thing to be here,<br> and I didn't get one.<br> If you see anybody,<br> any of the rangers or anything,<br> just tell them you didn't see me, okay?<br> Okay.<br> Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,<br> man. I wish I could stay, you know.<br> Take care, man.<br> - All right. Take care, Mads.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Bye, Alex.<br> - I wish... I wish I could stay.<br> Say hello to Mexico from me.<br> Bye, Alex!<br> It would be Christmas<br> in a couple of months,<br> and the last news we'd had<br> was about his car being found.<br> I woke up a couple of days ago,<br> and for the first time, it bothered me<br> that it wasn't only my parents<br> who hadn't heard from Chris.<br> Honey?<br> It's me. I'm sorry.<br> Everything that happened, it's my fault.<br> Give me another chance.<br> Please do that... Come on.<br> Do that for me.<br> Come on. They're calling<br> for another quarter right now,<br> and I ain't got it, so will you hurry it up?<br> Come on now, don't hang up on me.<br> Hey, here's a quarter.<br> Thank you.<br> There's a quarter<br> just happened out of the sky,<br> so I'm on here talking to you again.<br> I got the quarter now, let's...<br> No, no, no, no, no!<br> I wondered why he hadn't tried to call<br> in case I might answer.<br> He could've hung up if it wasn't me.<br> Why wouldn't he send a letter,<br> maybe through a friend?<br> It hurt a little,<br> but I told myself it was good.<br> He knew I loved him enough<br> to bear with the not knowing.<br> And it helped me remember that there<br> was something more than rebellion,<br> more than anger that was driving him.<br> Chris had always been driven,<br> had always been an adventurer.<br> When he was four years old,<br> he once wandered six blocks away<br> from home at 3:00 in the morning.<br> He was found in a neighbor's kitchen<br> up on a chair,<br> digging through their candy drawer.<br> Whatever drawer he was opening now<br> must have something pretty sweet in it.<br> - You lived in a cave for 36 days?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And how did you get into Mexico<br> in the first place?<br> Through the spillway at Morelos Dam.<br> River dries out pretty quickly<br> beyond there, doesn't it?<br> Yeah. Turns into a maze of irrigation<br> canals, thanks to our dams up north.<br> So I ported my kayak over the desert,<br> and I hitched down to Golfo.<br> But after a few weeks, a sandstorm<br> came up and blew the kayak away.<br> So I walked back north. Here I am.<br> Well, you just can't be crossing<br> the borders without any identification.<br> - Are we understood?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I've eaten enough sand to send me<br> back to the city anyway.<br> All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.<br> Some may ask,<br> "Why act now? Why not wait?"<br> The answer is clear.<br> The world could wait no longer.<br> Hi. Do you have the time?<br> - Time?<br> - Time?<br> Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> Front and back.<br> I don't have any more clipboards,<br> so get one from the other fellas.<br> - Next.<br> - Hi.<br> Can you tell me how to get an ID?<br> - Did you lose your identification, sir?<br> - Yeah.<br> No birth certificate? Nothing?<br> Ouch.<br> All right. Well, you're gonna<br> have to work that out with the DMV.<br> You can catch them in the morning.<br> The closest one is Montebello,<br> and we can help you<br> with the bus voucher.<br> So just come to this desk<br> when you're ready for the voucher.<br> - Okay.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Alexander Supertramp.<br> - What's that?<br> - Alexander Supertramp.<br> - Supertramp. Really?<br> Yeah.<br> Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,<br> Supertramp. I got something for you.<br> - Here you go, Supertramp.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Okay, baby.<br> - And one last thing.<br> - Yeah.<br> Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...<br> Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.<br> Sign your name right here.<br> You fill this out. And I'll set you right up.<br> Now, I'm out of...<br> - What's going on back there?<br> - I got it. I'm sorry.<br> - Come on, now. Work with me.<br> - All right. Thanks, ma'am.<br> Supertramp, huh?<br> You know the drill.<br> Move it!<br> Thanks, but I'm not gonna need<br> that bed after all.<br> You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!<br> Show me your face.<br> I never, ever, ever forget a face.<br> If I see yours again,<br> I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.<br> This is the goddamned railroad,<br> and we will do whatever we have to do<br> to keep you freeloaders<br> from violating our liability.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You got any ID?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Of course you don't.<br> Last time, my friend.<br> All clear.<br> Good boy!<br> Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.<br> Finally!<br> It's a mystery to me<br> We have a greed<br> With which we have agreed<br> You think you have to want more<br> than you need<br> Until you have it all you won't be freed<br> Society, you're a crazy breed<br> I hope you're not lonely without me<br> When you want more than you have<br> You think you need<br> And when you think more than you want<br> Your thoughts begin to bleed<br> I think I need to find a bigger place<br> 'Cause when you have<br> more than you think<br> You need more space<br> Society, you're a crazy breed<br> I hope you're not lonely without me<br> Society, crazy indeed<br> I hope you're not lonely without me<br> Thanks a lot.<br> In the letters<br> Chris wrote me from college,<br> it was clear his anguish and problems<br> with Mom and Dad had continued.<br> He said I was<br> the only person in the world<br> who could possibly understand<br> what he had to say.<br> With whose money are you buying<br> all these goddamn presents?<br> I work. The only reason<br> I'm not talking is because<br> you're wandering around acting like<br> the big-shot flirt with everybody.<br> I am making the contacts<br> for this business to work!<br> You don't care at all about what I do!<br> I don't even want to talk to you<br> about it anymore!<br> Don't you walk away from me, woman!<br> Woman!<br> Kids! Look what your dad<br> is doing to me!<br> For God's sake,<br> look what your mother is making me do!<br> Fuck you! I hate you!<br> There ain't gonna be no party.<br> I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.<br> Cancel Christmas?<br> Who do you think you are? God?<br> That's right! I'm God!<br> Well, you're not God.<br> You can't cancel Christmas.<br> That's bullshit!<br> We're 10 deep!<br> Alex, I don't mean to be on you about<br> everything. You're doing a great job.<br> I wanna keep you on and<br> we all wanna help you get to Alaska,<br> but you've got to start wearing socks.<br> With almost a year having passed<br> since Chris' disappearance,<br> my parents' anger, their desperation,<br> their guilt was giving way to pain.<br> And pain seemed to bring them closer.<br> Even their faces had changed.<br> She convinces herself it's Chris,<br> that it's her son<br> whenever she passes a stray.<br> That it's her son<br> whenever she passes a stray.<br> And I fear for the mother in her.<br> Instincts that seem to sense the threat<br> of a loss so huge<br> and irrevocable that the mind balks<br> at taking its measure.<br> I'd begin to wonder if I can understand<br> all that Chris is saying any longer,<br> but I catch myself and remember that<br> these are not the parents<br> he grew up with,<br> but people softened by the forced<br> reflection that comes with loss.<br> Still, everything Chris is saying<br> has to be said.<br> And I trust for him that<br> everything he is doing has to be done.<br> This is our life.<br> Big game. Very big game.<br> Got it.<br> Damn it!<br> Get off!<br> "Hey, Dad, can I light the barbeque,<br> please, Dad, this time?"<br> "Well, Son,<br> you can go get the lighter fluid."<br> "Come on, Dad. Please, Dad, please?"<br> "Well, why not, Walt?<br> That sounds like a good idea..."<br> "Shut up, Carine! Shut up, Carine!<br> "No, Billie. I told you once.<br> Don't make me tell you again. Okay?<br> "Okay?<br> "You hear me? You hear me, woman?<br> "You hear me, woman? Huh?<br> You hear me, woman?"<br> "Sorry. Sorry, Walt. I'm sorry."<br> Shit.<br> No! No! Damn it!<br> God damn it! Fuck!<br> "There was clearly felt the presence of<br> a force not bound to be kind to man.<br> "It was a place of heathenism<br> and superstitious rites,<br> "to be inhabited by men<br> nearer of kin to the rocks<br> "and to the wild animals than we."<br> Sunni.<br> Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.<br> No. No!<br> But now all I'm focused on<br> is just Alaska.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Alaska.<br> All right. Let's hear it for Insane Cain!<br> Let's give it up<br> for Slab City's own Tracy T!<br> Let's give it up<br> for Slab City's own Tracy T!<br> Hey. My name's Tracy.<br> - Tracy!<br> - Yeah!<br> Jack London is king.<br> Hey, you gonna stay with us long?<br> Well, I'm waiting on a check<br> from my last job<br> to come into Salton City<br> the day after Christmas.<br> I've got to start thinking about<br> getting ready for Alaska.<br> When the sun gets a little lower tonight,<br> I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.<br> After the check comes in,<br> I think I'm gonna try to find<br> some big old mountains I can climb<br> every day until spring comes.<br> I've got to see<br> how far the money's gonna go.<br> I've still got a lot of supplies<br> to pick up before spring.<br> So, I might get another job<br> or I might be okay.<br> Hell, we'd give you a little something for<br> the days you spend in the booth here.<br> I'm not taking<br> any money from you, Rainey.<br> It's been a real great twist<br> meeting you two.<br> You two look like you're doing good.<br> - We are doing good.<br> - Yeah?<br> We're doing real good.<br> Speaking of which, don't you think<br> you ought to introduce yourself<br> to our little Joni Mitchell over there?<br> I...<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> You selling these books?<br> I am. We are.<br> He was.<br> I like to read.<br> - Do you?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's good.<br> I heard you play your song last night.<br> - I'm terrible.<br> - You are not terrible. You sing sweet.<br> Thank you.<br> I was gonna go take a walk<br> to Salvation Mountain.<br> - You wanna go?<br> - Okay.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi. Alex.<br> I'd like to show you around up here.<br> I've been here since 1984, more or less.<br> A lot of tourists come in here<br> and they look at that car door up there.<br> They really like it.<br> And I found car doors and put them<br> up there and I bolted it all in.<br> Where did you get the telephone poles?<br> A lot of people in the valley<br> just love me a lot.<br> Everybody now, I think,<br> in the whole world is just loving me.<br> And I want to have the wisdom<br> to love them back.<br> And that's about it.<br> So I really get excited.<br> You really believe in love, then.<br> Yeah. Totally.<br> This is a love story that is staggering<br> to everybody in the whole world.<br> That God really loves us a lot.<br> Does that answer that?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Good.<br> I really love it here. I think the freedom<br> of this place is just so beautiful.<br> To me, I wouldn't move for $10 million,<br> unless I had to.<br> So I'm contented here in the desert,<br> and I'm living where I want to live.<br> And I think good gets better.<br> And I think those great big tanks there<br> were the sewer plant for<br> the Marine base in World War II.<br> If you want to,<br> you can try putting your hands in there.<br> And I'm gonna do the same thing,<br> just for the fun.<br> You're doing real good.<br> You can wipe your hands off on my shirt<br> if you want.<br> This is starting to make me hungry.<br> I was just a couple of years older<br> than Tracy when I got pregnant.<br> - Wow.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I thought my husband and I were<br> going to just make peace on Earth<br> and babies and love<br> and stay together forever,<br> and that didn't quite work out that way.<br> He left me.<br> So, I...<br> Anyway, whatever,<br> but I ended up raising Reno on my own.<br> That's my boy, his name's Reno.<br> Then I met Rainey.<br> That was sweet.<br> It was really good for a while. It's just...<br> You know, Reno was<br> a teenager already by then,<br> and he was just on his way<br> to becoming his own man.<br> And I haven't even heard from him<br> in two years.<br> I don't even know where he is.<br> I hope I get to meet him sometime.<br> Do your folks know where you are?<br> Hey, guys?<br> Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.<br> Yeah, we are. We're hungry.<br> I'll be all right.<br> You want to come and eat?<br> Or we'll sit here.<br> Because I will sit here with you all night.<br> Let's go. Let's go.<br> Guys, come on.

They went to call my grandma<br> for Christmas.<br> No, I mean we can't do that.<br> Why not?<br> How old are you?<br> Eighteen.<br> Seventeen.<br> What year were you born?<br> So I'm 16.<br> You want to do something together?<br> You can send mail to this address<br> in South Dakota.<br> I don't know when I'm going to get it,<br> but I'll get it.<br> You're pretty magic.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> And just remember<br> if you want something in life,<br> reach out and grab it.<br> - You take care, kiddo.<br> - You, too.<br> - New Year's resolution?<br> - We'll work on it.<br> Just get your pack<br> and get on out of here, okay?<br> I don't think I could take a hug.<br> Hey.<br> Bye!<br> A year and a half had passed in what<br> Dad called "suspended animation."<br> The weight of Chris' disappearance had<br> begun to lay down on me full-length.<br> "I have lived through much,<br> "and now I think I have found what is<br> needed for happiness.<br> "A quiet secluded life in the country,<br> "with the possibility of being useful to<br> people to whom it is easy to do good,<br> "and who are not accustomed<br> to have it done to them.<br> "And work which one hopes<br> may be of some use.<br> "Then rest, nature, books, music,<br> "love for one's neighbor.<br> "Such is my idea of happiness.<br> "And then, on top of all that,<br> you for a mate,<br> "and children perhaps.<br> "What more<br> can the heart of a man desire?"<br> Comes the morning when I can feel<br> That there's nothing<br> left to be concealed<br> Moving on<br> a scene surreal<br> But my heart will never<br> Never be far from here<br> Sure as I'm breathing<br> Sure as I'm sad<br> I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh<br> I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh<br> I leave here believing<br> More than I had<br> And there's a reason I will<br> A reason I'll be back<br> As I walk the hemisphere<br> I got my wish to up and disappear<br> I've been wounded<br> I've been healed<br> Now for landing I've been<br> Landing I've been cleared<br> Sure as I'm breathing<br> Sure as I'm sad<br> I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh<br> I leave here believing<br> More than I had<br> This love has got no ceiling<br> Where's your camp?<br> Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.<br> I've lived in and around here<br> for six years now<br> and I've never heard of any place<br> that goes by that name.<br> - Show me how to get there.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Ron Franz.<br> - Alex.<br> Alex? Where you from, Alex?<br> - West Virginia.<br> - Okay, Alex from West Virginia.<br> Well, this is something out here.<br> Don't you...<br> Don't you worry about those dope<br> smokers and nudists down below there?<br> No, they keep to themselves<br> pretty much.<br> You strike me as a bright young man.<br> Am I wrong about that?<br> I think I've got<br> my head on my shoulders pretty good.<br> Well, that's what I mean.<br> How long you been out here?<br> - Couple of weeks.<br> - And before that?<br> A lot of places.<br> Been moving around a lot.<br> - Well, how old are you?<br> - Twenty-three.<br> Twenty-three years old!<br> Son, don't you think<br> you ought to be getting an education?<br> And a job?<br> And making something of this life?<br> Look, Mr. Franz,<br> I think careers are a 20th century<br> invention, and I don't want one.<br> You don't need to worry about me.<br> I have a college education.<br> I'm not destitute.<br> I'm living like this by choice.<br> - In the dirt?<br> - Yeah, in the dirt.<br> - Where's your family?<br> - Don't have one anymore.<br> That's a shame.<br> Hey, Mr. Franz,<br> I want to show you something.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> It's getting a little steep.<br> A little high for me, kid.<br> All right,<br> but even from halfway out,<br> it's quite a sight, isn't it?<br> From the top, you can see all the way<br> to the Salton Sea, too.<br> You can see the Salton Sea<br> from up there?<br> Yes, sir.<br> My goodness.<br> - You don't want to go up?<br> - Nope. I don't do these kind of things.<br> I spent most of my life in the Army.<br> New Year's Eve, 1957,<br> I was stationed in Okinawa.<br> My wife and son were here in the States<br> just driving down the road,<br> and some fella who'd had too much<br> to drink plowed right into them.<br> Killed them both.<br> Now you might think<br> the last thing I would do in the world<br> is go to the whiskey.<br> But at the time,<br> it felt like the only thing I could do.<br> And I did it hard!<br> But pretty soon I realized<br> I wasn't doing my wife and son any good<br> mourning them with the bottle.<br> So I pulled myself together<br> and I quit drinking,<br> cold turkey.<br> So since all that, this is pretty much me.<br> Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?<br> No, I can't seem to get too far<br> from my leather.<br> I do a lot of leather engraving.<br> I got a little workshop out in the garage.<br> Between that and my pension,<br> I do pretty well.<br> But every time I think<br> I might take a trip somewhere,<br> I get too far behind on orders and such<br> to consider it.<br> When we finish eating,<br> I'd love to see your workshop.<br> - Would you?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I was hoping you'd say that.<br> - It's amazing how malleable this is.<br> - Yeah, it is.<br> When the leather is wet you can really...<br> - It's like butter.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's amazing. And then it hardens up,<br> and, I mean, it stays right there.<br> A good whack with the mallet.<br> Crack it down. Whack. Bang.<br> I went to South Dakota.<br> I worked at a grain elevator<br> for this guy named Wayne.<br> He was a really good guy.<br> So I took the Colorado River<br> all the way down through<br> the Grand Canyon and did rapids,<br> which is by far one of<br> the scariest things I've ever done.<br> And I took the Colorado down into<br> Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.<br> Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.<br> What's the "N" stand for?<br> North.<br> Alaska?<br> Son, what the hell<br> are you running from?<br> You know, I can ask you<br> the same question!<br> Except I already know the answer!<br> You do, do you?<br> I do, Mr. Franz!<br> You got to get back out in the world!<br> Get out of that lonely house,<br> that little workshop of yours.<br> Get back out on the road! Really!<br> You're going to live a long time, Ron!<br> You should make a radical change<br> in your lifestyle!<br> I mean, the core of man's spirit<br> comes from new experiences.<br> And there you are, stubborn old man,<br> sitting on your butt.<br> - Sitting on my butt?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'll show you sitting on my butt!<br> "Stubborn old man."<br> I'll show you!<br> Come on, then! Come on.<br> Sitting on my butt? Yeah.<br> Come on, old man. Come climbing.<br> Sitting on my butt.<br> Come on. Keep going!<br> You're doing great!<br> - Keep going. Keep going, Ron!<br> - Yeah!<br> Can anybody see this?<br> God, are you watching this right now?<br> Yeah.<br> - You all right?<br> - You little pinhead!<br> I'm gonna miss you when you go.<br> I'll miss you, too, Ron.<br> But you're wrong if you think<br> that the joy of life comes principally<br> from human relationships.<br> God's placed it all around us.<br> It's in everything.<br> It's in anything we can experience.<br> People just need to change the way<br> they look at those things.<br> Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.<br> No, I am.<br> I am.<br> I am.<br> But I wanted to tell you something.<br> From the bits and pieces I put together,<br> you know, from what you told me about<br> your family, your mother and your dad.<br> And I know you've got your problems<br> with the church, too.<br> But there's some kind of bigger thing<br> we can all appreciate,<br> and it sounds like<br> you don't mind calling it God.<br> But when you forgive,<br> you love.<br> And when you love,<br> God's light shines on you.<br> - Holy shit.<br> - I told you about that language.<br> I told you so!<br> Where are the fucking animals now?<br> I'm hungry!<br> I'm fucking hungry! I'm fucking hungry!<br> "For a moment she rediscovered<br> the purpose of her life.<br> "She was here on earth to grasp<br> the meaning of its wild enchantment,<br> "and to call each thing<br> by its right name."<br> "By its right name."<br> What is this? What is this one?<br> This is Viburnum edule.<br> Viburnum edule.<br> Hedysarum alpinum.<br> Hedysarum alpinum is wild potato root.<br> Wild potato root.<br> Epilobium angustifolium. Fireweed.<br> Fuck it all. Fuck it all!<br> Hi.<br> What are you doing up?<br> It's 3:30 in the morning.<br> I heard you get off the couch<br> about a half hour ago.<br> Had a funny feeling<br> you might not be here for our breakfast.<br> I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to<br> someplace where you can catch a train,<br> a plane or hitch a ride<br> and not get stuck out in this desert.<br> I'd take you all the way to Alaska<br> if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.<br> - Ron, you don't have to do that.<br> - I want to do it.<br> Get you started on this thing of yours.<br> - On my great...<br> - I know.<br> On your great Alaskan adventure.<br> Here. Here's a machete.<br> Collapsible fishing pole, a few other<br> odds and ends I stuck in there for you.<br> - Ron...<br> - Just take it.<br> I'll get dressed<br> and meet you in the truck.<br> Well, my friend.<br> Yep.<br> I had an idea.<br> You know, my mother was an only child<br> and so was my father,<br> and I was their only child,<br> so when I'm gone,<br> I'm the end of the line.<br> My family will be finished.<br> What do you say you let me adopt you?<br> I can be, say, your grandfather.<br> Ron,<br> could we talk about this<br> when I get back from Alaska?<br> Would that be okay?<br> Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.<br> All right, Ron.<br> Thank you.<br> What did his voice sound like now?<br> What would he tell about now?<br> ...nine, ten.<br> I realized that the words to my thoughts<br> were of less and less meaning.<br> Chris was writing his story,<br> and it had to be Chris who would tell it.<br> "To call each thing by its right name.<br> "By its right name."<br> What if I were smiling<br> and running into your arms?<br> Would you see then<br> what I see now?<br>
