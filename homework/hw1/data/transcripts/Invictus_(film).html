How is it going?<br> ANNOUNCER: Number 10.<br> Very badly.<br> Maybe it's just as well.<br> Why?<br> I've just been at a meeting<br> of the National Sports executive.<br> There's a strong support to drop the<br> Springbok emblem and colors altogether.<br> If they play badly,<br> maybe it's a good time to make a change.<br> This could be the last time<br> we have to look at the green and gold.<br> Fuck, man. This is bullshit.<br> MAN: Franois Pienaar's team came<br> to Loftus Versfeld Stadium this afternoon...<br> ...unprepared and arrogant.<br> They left 80 minutes later...<br> ...with their tails between their legs<br> like whipped mongrels.<br> And I, for one, am glad.<br> Not because they lost,<br> but because there is now no way...<br> ...to ignore the fact that we are<br> completely and utterly unprepared...<br> ...to reenter the world<br> of topnotch international rugby.<br> The Rugby World Cup<br> is now less than a year away.<br> And I, for one, am relieved<br> that we are the host nation...<br> ...and therefore qualify automatically<br> for the tournament.<br> - Somebody gets the ax.<br> - Because I am not sure...<br> ...that we would get in on merit alone.<br> - Who's it gonna be?<br> Pienaar's team played<br> without discipline...<br> ...without strategy and without courage.<br> - And therefore...<br> - He's trying to get them to drop me.<br> He's just bitter because the Springboks<br> were boycotted when he played.<br> Maybe. But people listen<br> to what he says.<br> They brought shame upon our nation.<br> And I, for one, can say<br> without fear of contradiction...<br> ...that today, these 15...<br> ...so-called men did not deserve<br> to wear the hallowed green and gold.<br> Here's your muti, Madiba.<br> I warmed the milk tonight.<br> Ah. You are too good to me, Mary.<br> Your daughter called<br> to cancel her visit this weekend.<br> Did she say why?<br> No, she didn't.<br> She said to tell you she was sorry.<br> I see.<br> Do you need anything else tonight?<br> No, Mary, thank you. I will go to bed.<br> Good evening, Dada.<br> Good evening, Mary.<br> - Hello. There you go.<br> DLAMINl: God bless you.<br> Thank you.<br> COLE: Some nice pants for you.<br> DLAMINl: God bless you.<br> COLE:<br> There you go.<br> There you go.<br> DLAMINl:<br> God bless you.<br> You're a very lucky boy.<br> It's a real Springbok practice jersey.<br> I mean, I know it's a bit big,<br> but it's warm and it'll last forever.<br> Huh? Come.<br> Go on, take it, it's yours.<br> - Why won't he take it?<br> - Lf he wears it, the others will beat him up.<br> Because the Springboks<br> are playing so badly?<br> No, because for them<br> Springbok still represents apartheid.<br> And now for the next item on our agenda.<br> The NSC executive proposes a vote<br> on the following motion:<br> That, as a permanent symbol<br> of the apartheid era...<br> ...the colors, emblem...<br> ...and the name of the Springboks,<br> be eliminated immediately.<br> And that all sports teams<br> representing South Africa...<br> ...shall be known forthwith...<br> ...as the Proteas.<br> Now, comrades,<br> we will submit this motion to a hand vote.<br> And in the event of a close count,<br> we'll go to a written ballot.<br> All of those in favor of eliminating<br> the Springboks, raise your hands.<br> - Viva, Proteas, viva!<br> - Viva!<br> Both units to their cars right now.<br> All right, let's go. Let's do it.<br> BRENDA: What do I tell<br> the Japanese trade delegation?<br> MANDELA:<br> I delegate that decision to you.<br> - Do you want me to inform the VP?<br> - No.<br> We should at least include<br> the minister of sport.<br> No.<br> I strongly advise against doing this,<br> especially on your own.<br> It gives the impression<br> of autocratic leadership.<br> You risk alienating your cabinet<br> and your party.<br> Your advice is duly noted.<br> Madiba.

I've always thought<br> to lead by example, sir.<br> Well, that is right. That is exactly right.<br> But how to get them to be better<br> than they think they can be?<br> That is very difficult, I find.<br> Inspiration, perhaps.<br> How do we inspire ourselves to greatness,<br> when nothing less will do?<br> How do we inspire everyone around us?<br> I sometimes think it is<br> by using the work of others.<br> On Robben Island...<br> ...when things got very bad...<br> ...I found inspiration in a poem.<br> - A poem?<br> - A Victorian poem.<br> Just words.<br> But they helped me to stand<br> when all I wanted to do was to lie down.<br> But you didn't come all this way<br> to hear an old man talk...<br> ...about things that make no sense.<br> No, no, please, Mr. President.<br> It makes complete sense to me.<br> On the day of a big match, say, a test...<br> ...in the bus on the way to the stadium,<br> nobody talks.<br> - Yes. They're all preparing.<br> - Right.<br> But when I think we're ready,<br> I have the bus driver put on a song.<br> Something I've chosen, one we all know.<br> And we listen to the words together.<br> And it helps.<br> I remember when I was invited to<br> the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.<br> Everybody in the stadium<br> greeted me with a song.<br> At the time, the future...<br> ...our future, seemed very bleak.<br> But to hear that song in the voices<br> of people from all over our planet...<br> ...made me proud to be South African.<br> It inspired me to come home<br> and do better.<br> It allowed me to expect more of myself.<br> May I ask, what was the song, sir?<br> Well, it was "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika".<br> A very inspiring song.<br> We need inspiration, Franois.<br> Because in order to build our nation...<br> ...we must all exceed<br> our own expectations.<br> So, what's he like?<br> He's not like anyone I've ever met before.<br> Yeah, I hope. What did he want?<br> What did he talk about? Did he talk<br> about rugby? What did he talk about?<br> Franois.
