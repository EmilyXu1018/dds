                        I want you to come quick.<br> Don't go!<br> Edward Lanman was sitting in<br> his pleasant house in London<br> The sun was shining<br> It was an early morning in June, not quite...<br> Iris.<br> Iris, wait for me.<br> Just keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right.<br> -You won't keep still.<br> -I can't keep still.<br> I can't catch up with you.<br> -Iris, you've got bicycle oil on your ankle.<br> -I don't care, John.<br> Those of you, our guests...<br> ... on whose magnificent generosity<br> we depend...<br> ...we really are most frightfully grateful...<br> ...will need no introduction to<br> one of our most distinguished graduates...<br> ... an honorary fellow, Dame Iris Murdoch.<br> She's a noted philosopher as well as<br> author of some twenty-six novels.<br> And we are honoured to have her with us today.<br> As well as the distinguished<br> Warton Professor of Literature..<br> ...who has the great good fortune<br> of being married to her.<br> I need say no more about her.<br> For good wine needs no bush.<br> But she will not mind comparison with...<br> ... say, a really fine vintage claret.<br> ... Dame Iris will speak to you<br> about the importance of education.<br> Education doesn't make you happy.<br> And nor does freedom.<br> We don't become happy<br> just because we're free -- if we are...<br> ... or because we've been educated, if we have.<br> But because education may be the means...<br> ... by which we realise we are happy.<br> It opens our eyes, our ears.<br> Tells us where delights are lurking.<br> Convinces us that there is only one freedom...<br> ... of any importance whatsoever.<br> That of the mind.<br> And gives us the assurance,the confidence...<br> ...to walk the path our mind,<br> our educated mind offers.<br> I shall tell him all my love.<br> All my soul's adoration.<br> And I think he will hear me.<br> And will not say me nay.<br> It is this that gives my soul.<br> All it's joyous elation.<br> As I hear the sweet larks sing.<br> In the clear air of the day.<br> Yes, of course there's something fishy...<br> ... about describing people's feelings.<br> Try hard to beaccurate, but...<br> ... as soon as you start to define<br> such and such a feeling...<br> ... language let's you down.<br> When we really speak the truth,<br> words are insufficient.<br> Almost everything,<br> except things like "pass the gravy" ...<br> ... is a lie of a sort.<br> And that being the case, I shall shut up.<br> And pass the gravy.<br> But love, or at least unsatisfied love...<br> ... is concerned as much with understanding.<br> And real love, extreme love...<br> ... once it's recognised<br> has stamp of the indubitable...<br> Ah, John, may I call you, John, may I?<br> Meet Miss Murdoch.<br> Iris, my dear, John Bayley.<br> One of the more promising young lecturers<br> in the English School.<br> Though I caught him out over<br> Old English grammar, his weaker side I fear.<br> A minor question of Anglo-Saxon syntax.<br> Wine!<br> I mean...<br> ... It went down the wrong way.<br> Yes, I like that.<br> There is a right way down, of course.<br> Amazing how most of us find it<br> without even thinking about it.<br> I rarely think...<br> If you think about it, you'll never find it.<br> Best thing to do<br> is hang on and trust the body. I do.<br> Human beings love each other.<br> In sex, in friendship...<br> ... and when they're in love.<br> And they cherish other beings.<br> Humans, animals, plants - even stones.<br> The quest for happiness<br> and the promotion of happiness--<br> --is in all of this<br> and the power of our imagination.<br> I'm writing a novel.<br> I don't suppose you have the time<br> or the inclination to even read a novel.<br> I've written one. It's going to be published.<br> And I'm writing another.<br> Can I read it?<br> No-one has read It -- None of my friends.<br> What's it about?<br> About? It has something for everyone.<br> A bit like Shakespeare?<br> Perhaps, yes.<br> Please don't talk to anyone about it.<br> No. Course not.<br> I won't tell a soul.<br> Every human soul has seen,<br> perhaps even before their birth...<br> ... pure forms. Such as justice, temperance...<br> ... beauty ...<br> ... and all the great moral qualities<br> which we hold in honour.<br> We are moved towards what is good...<br> ... by the faint memory of these forms.<br> Simple - -and calm and blessed...<br> ...which we saw once in a pure clear light...<br> ... being pure ourselves.<br> 'Wholegrain'.<br> Do we have wholegrain or something other?<br> What is whole?<br> Is It something in itself or does it have parts?<br> Oh, spaghetti.<br> If you have a whole you have a whole.<br> Ooh, sausages.<br> You and me is a whole.<br> If you toddle off there's a hole in the whole.<br> Or, if I do.<br> But a whole can't be broken,<br> it just forms another whole.<br> -Baked beans.<br> -Baked beans.<br> Do you want Premium points?<br> Do we deserve them?<br> -Do you want bags?<br> -Bags, yes.<br> You know, it's all around us,<br> people like you and me talking nonsense.<br> I know, I know.<br> Bag for life:<br> -For life?<br> -That's what it says.<br> We have to ask, give you the choice.<br> Ooh, rather.<br> You just have to listen, that's the job.<br> You call it a job but it's like music, what you do.<br> You live with the angels,<br> speak their language, the music of the spheres.<br> Nowadays the only language<br> anyone really understands...<br> ...is pictures. Paint the picture.<br> See, now I'm bagged for life.<br> Love's the only language everyone understands.<br> Ooh love, yes.<br> I can read It but I can't speak it.<br> My coat's caught on your chair.<br> And the captain said<br> as the two weevils dropped out of the biscuit...<br> ..."which would you rather have, Mr Smith?"<br> "The bigger one, sir."<br> "Wrong, Mr Smith, wrong."<br> "In the Navy you should always...<br> ...choose the lesser of the two weevils."<br> Patrick O'Brian.<br> "Between two evils<br> always choose the one you haven't tried before."<br> Mea West. Oh my vest!<br> I tore my vest again this morning.<br> You must get some new vests.<br> Jolly good.<br> You must get some new vests.<br> I just said that.<br> You're always saying<br> that you just said something. Me too.<br> Good job<br> you reminded me I had two lectures today.<br> You remembered.<br> No, but I remembered<br> to apologise for the one I forgot.<br> They were very sweet about it.<br> Glad not to have listen to you, I expect.<br> Oh, I'm sure.<br> They'd have been delighted<br> to have listened to you.<br> I always have been.<br> -Iris!<br> -John.<br> Than kyou. Keep the change.<br> -Janet. Janet!<br> -Oh my God, Iris.<br> Am I late?<br> Oh no, it's the hokie-cokie.<br> Everything will be over.<br> Oh, John, wait. I've got my stocking caught up.<br> Stupid things. Really.<br> I'm not sure I'm entirely -- I'm so sorry.<br> Oh, sorry.<br> Cha-cha-cha.<br> Cha-cha-cha.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You too.<br> That was my husband.<br> Cha-cha-cha.<br> Are you with Iris?<br> Hoping so.<br> You know we have...<br> I thought we had.<br> ...nearly met.<br> -Are you a friend of Iris?<br> -Yes.<br> She seems to have a lot of f...<br> Janet Stone. John Bayley.<br> -How do you do?<br> -How do you do?<br> Shall we?<br> What are your rooms like?<br> Adequate,thank you.<br> I'd like to see them.<br> Do you have a lot of friends?<br> Is a list of my friends necessary?<br> I justwondered if you had many.<br> There aren't many people<br> that one wants to know one.<br> Iris!<br> You might fall.<br> Would you like some champagne?<br> That would be nice.<br> I've had some since Christmas...<br> It does keep, doesn't it?<br> I shouldn't be doing this.<br> What?<br> Having women in my room. It's not permitted.<br> I wouldn't say you'd had me exactly.<br> Have you danced before?<br> It was all right, wasn't it?<br> Oh, I think so.<br> Broke the ice, so to speak.<br> -"Ice"?<br> -What?<br> It'll do.<br> Aren't you particular<br> about words at your college?<br> I'm only here under sufferance really,<br> as a tutor and guide.<br> I get all the Americans<br> and Frenchmen to mother.<br> You love words, don't you?<br> If one doesn't have words, how does one think?<br> Shall I do that?<br> What is your novel about?<br> About?<br> How to be free.<br> How to be good...<br> ...and how to love.<br> Well, that's all there is, I'd say.<br> Language is all very well, you know, but...<br> ...it's not the only way<br> of understanding each other.<br> There's sight and...<br> ...and smell and...touch, of course.<br> I love your nose.<br> It's snub.<br> Snubby...<br> ...snubby, snubby.<br> it's snubby, snubby, snubby.<br> Let me do that to you.<br> Take off your jacket.<br> If we were, as it were, married...<br> ...we could do this all the time.<br> Perhaps?<br> We should be doing it nearly all the time.<br> Yes, but if...<br> Thank you.<br> Look.<br> I'm stopping you working.<br> Yes, well, I don't mind.<br> How's it coming along?<br> It's harder to write than all the others. Much.<br> Have you noticed?<br> Just that you've seemed...<br> puzzled every now and again.<br> That's it, yes.<br> Puzzled.<br> Puzzled. It's a funny word.<br> All words are like that<br> when you take them by surprise, aren't they?<br> Have you got a title?<br> 'A lot of trees...<br> ...seem near.'<br> We must stop it.<br> What to do?<br> The window, John, the window!<br> We must stop it.<br> No. See...<br> ...it's gone.<br> We all worry about going mad, don'twe?<br> How would we know...<br> ...those of us who live in our minds anyway?<br> Other people would tell us.<br> Would they, John?<br> I don't want to set the world...<br> Sorry.<br> ...on fire.<br> John Bayley.<br> Haven't seen her for ages.<br> Jolly good -- nice.<br> Takes all sorts. Not that I ...<br> ...we're all men at St Anthony's.<br> Do you like women?<br> I mean, do women like you?<br> You mean lesbians?<br> Yes.<br> Would it bother you if they did?<br> Oh no, the some thing happens with me.<br> With homosexuals, I mean.<br> And do you go to bed with them?<br> Lord no.<br> At the college... they are all,<br> as somebody once said to me...<br> ..."Old fashioned lesbians of the highest type".<br> And do you go to bed with them?<br> -Dame Iris?<br> -Yeah.<br> It's this way.<br> She's written philosophy and plays and poetry...<br> ...but her novels are her lasting literay legacy.<br> Iris Murdoch is acknowledged<br> as the foremost English novelist...<br> ...of her generation.<br> A little excessive, don't you think?<br> What do you reckon, shall I take that again?<br> Her novels embrace the subjects of freedom...<br> ...and what it means to be good.<br> And they're all studies<br> in the successes and failures of love.<br> She's written philosophy and plays and poetry...<br> ...but her novels are her lasting literay legacy.<br> People, ofcourse,<br> are very secretive and for many reasons...<br> ...want to appear what they call 'ordinary'.<br> Everybody has thoughts they want to conceal.<br> Perhaps even<br> quite simple aspects of their lives.<br> People have obsessions and fears and...<br> ...and passions which they don't admit to.<br> I think any character<br> is interesting and has extremes.<br> it's a novelist's privilege to...<br> ...see how odd everyone is.<br> In your novels you yourself...<br> ...were very exacting your use of language...<br> ...but in general terms, do you think<br> the language is becoming debased?<br> Reading and writing...<br> ...and the preservation of language<br> and its forms...<br> ...and...<br> ...the kind of eloquence<br> and beauty that language is capable of...<br> ...is something terribly important<br> to human beings...<br> ...this is connected to thought.<br> If children are not taught...<br> What did you say? Did you ask...?<br> I was asking about the importance of language.<br> John.<br> John. John.<br> Iris?<br> John.<br> -Oh, you're there. I'm back.<br> -What is it?<br> -Much earlier than I thought.<br> -Yes, I came straight back.<br> I didn't know why I was there.<br> You were going to do an interview.<br> -Well,what interview?<br> -I don't know.<br> And see your publisher?<br> -Was it your publisher?<br> -So I came back.<br> I didn't expect you back for ages.<br> -Has Norah rung?<br> -I didn't answer.<br> Iris, Norah's dead.<br> Oh, so she is. Oh,that is sad.<br> Of, well, nevermind.<br> It must have been Ed.<br> What for?<br> Oh, so I came back.<br> What is...<br> ...the name of the Prime Minister?<br> -Are you asking me?<br> -Yes, I am.<br> I know.<br> Okay, what is the name of the Prime Minister?<br> I don't know. Ask John. Surely It doesn't matter.<br> Okay. Well, no, not really.<br> Someone will know.<br> Who would you like to see?<br> -I mean, is there anyone...?<br> -I don't know.<br> Shall I look up some names, talk to someone?<br> I've got a lot of ideas,<br> but they won't come together.<br> It happens all the time, forgetting names.<br> So, does it happens all the time?<br> Does she mean "writer's block"?<br> I suppose she does, but...<br> -Iris can always write, Doctor.<br> -Oh, I know.<br> -Iris is a person of some...<br> -Yes. But it doesn't work like that...<br> But surely in her case,<br> a woman with a first-class mind?<br> We'll have to be certain.<br> There'll have to be tests, scans.<br> Well, I don't think I can...<br> I mean it's a little beyond my competence.<br> Iris finds her new book very tiring and difficult.<br> Basically, I'll arrange something.<br> Iris has a very clear mind...<br> ...mine's a muddle but not hers.<br> She does everything, always has.<br> Food, shopping...<br> ...tickets for things...<br> I never know how she manages<br> and does her books as well.<br> Well, they can get your help.<br> No, nobody would suit. We're odd, you know.<br> There's a very good place,<br> a specialist nursing home, Vale Hose.<br> -Not necessary.<br> -Oh, no, not yet.<br> -Not your fault. I'm sorry.<br> -I'm orry.<br> Well...take care.<br> Goodbye, Doctor.<br> Thank you. Careful. Goodbye.<br> Iris!<br> I'm sure the country won't go to the dogs.<br> Not knowing the Prime Minister's name<br> is not a capital offence.<br> -Absolutely.<br> -I know the names that matter.<br> It'll be all right.<br> Well, it will be if you stop worrying.<br> I've got a book to finish.<br> ...Tony Blair. So there.<br> Iris, are you comfortable?<br> I'm going to start the scan now.<br> Just keep nice and still.<br> Try to relax.<br> It'll take about fifteen minutes.<br> John.<br> -Oh Janet.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> Is Iris still...? I'm so sorry I'm late.<br> I don't know what's going to happen, Janet.<br> I've left the car outside - the engine's running.<br> -...won't be a mo.<br> -Right.<br> -See you out there.<br> -Yes.<br> -John, I'm frightened.<br> -Everyone's doing their best.<br> Janet's got the car.<br> It will -- be...<br> -It's done.<br> -You're finished?<br> I thought you were close.<br> So far it hasn't made any difference.<br> Here's to it.<br> Must try and keep working.<br> -You must.<br> -I will.<br> And here's to the next one.<br> Just keep working,<br> keep talking, keep the words coming.<br> Keep at it.<br> I shall come on<br> like a deprived animal if I can't write.<br> Be liked a starved dog.<br> No, no, no. I'll keep you at it.<br> I feel...<br> ...as if I'm sailing into darkness.<br> Thing you eat with.<br> animal<br> An-im-al.<br> Toothbrush.<br> ...no...<br> Yes.<br> Por...<br> No. See...<br> Portrait<br> Tennis thing.<br> dog<br> God.<br> Iris is getting tired, I'm afraid.<br> Can we have the blinds?<br> Dame Iris, thank you very much. Than kyou.<br> Well done, puss.<br> Dame Iris, thank you very much indeed.<br> It's so kind of you to come, Dame Iris.<br> Thank you, I like it. Thank you very much.<br> Is it any help?<br> Well to us? Yes.<br> It's implacable.<br> What does that mean?<br> It means inexorable.<br> I know what the word means -- to me. To us.<br> You see, words have meant everything to her.<br> They would still mean something?<br> Some thought?<br> It can't just be dead birds dropping.<br> I know what it means and,<br> it doesn't surprise me...<br> ... it frightens me, but...<br> ...and then sometimes<br> it doesn't frighten me and ...<br> ...that's just as bad<br> because that's it winning, isn't it?<br> No, it's not...It won't win.<br> It will win.<br> There. It will win.<br> That's very kind.<br> Iris.<br> Iris,wait for me.<br> Just keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right!<br> You won't keep still!<br> I can' tkeep still!<br> I can't catch up with you!<br> Speed up!<br> Oh, good morning.<br> Ah, no...<br> I think it's the...<br> ...person who brings the post, John!<br> -Yes, it is.<br> -Yes.<br> John! So Sorry.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Thank you very much indeed.<br> So Sorry.<br> Go on. Go on, go on, go on...<br> It's only the postman.<br> -It's only the postman.<br> -Don't repeat everything, puss.<br> It's only the postman.<br> It's for you -- It's your book.<br> -What's that?<br> -Your book.<br> It's only the postman.<br> It's your book.<br> -IRIS MURDOCH - JACKSON'S DILEMA<br> -Isn't it perfectly splendid?<br> Why don't you look at it?<br> It's only the postman.<br> Oh, damn!<br> Stop nudging up to me like a water buffalo.<br> I have a lot to do. Lots to do, Iris.<br> See what I've done now?!<br> It's not your fault. Not your fault. Sorry, sorry.<br> -It's only the postman.<br> -Yes, all right, it's only the postman.<br> So sorry. There's lots to do.<br> Which side do I go?<br> Ask me my three<br> main priorities for Government...<br> ...and I tell you...<br> ...education, education and education.<br> John. John! Why does he keep saying that?<br> What does he mean?<br> -By what?<br> -Education, education, education.<br> I think he means learning,<br> everyone getting enough of it.<br> Why does he keep saying it?<br> Politicians have to keep repeating things<br> to make themselves heard.<br> They have to do anything<br> to make themselves liked.<br> Why does he want to eat a sheep's ear?<br> Shall I turn it off?<br> No!<br> We could go for a swim tomorrow,<br> if it's not raining.<br> -No.<br> -Yes, you love water.<br> When you swim you love it, swim?<br> Swim is good for you.<br> When are we leaving?<br> Not today.<br> Are we going to London?<br> No, we're going for a swim.<br> When are we leaving?<br> Not today.<br> When are we leaving?<br> Iris -- Iris, wait for me.<br> -You dirty old man!<br> -Hello.<br> There we go. Well done.<br> No, Iris, not with your socks on, your socks!<br> No, no, give me your hand. Give me your hand.<br> Give me your hand...<br> You'll pull me in. No, no...<br> You're all right. I won't let you go.<br> Let me get you dry. You're all right.<br> Where are your socks? Socks? No?<br> Uppy, uppy hands. Uppy hands. Let's get it on.<br> That's it.<br> Iris, come on. Just put your hand...<br> ...like this. Up hand. Up.<br> -Let's get your head through.<br> -Let's go now.<br> No, let's go now.<br> Iris, as soon as we've got your head in! Iris.<br> -Let's go now...<br> -Put your head down.<br> Where's my petticoat?<br> Here.<br> Are you sure he's expecting me?<br> Maurice.<br> I've brought John. You said I might...?<br> Did I? And did you say you would?<br> Yes. Well...come in.<br> -Maurice Charlton.<br> -John Bayley.<br> Isn't it hot?<br> Yes, Itis. I've got just the thing will cool.<br> I imagine your friend<br> Maurice is hoping to have his wicked will, is he?<br> Not today, is he?<br> You and I<br> are much the some age, aren't we, John?<br> I think so.<br> Does it matter?<br> No.<br> It's not important, is it?<br> What Maurice means is that most of my real...<br> ...my other friends are -- older than me.<br> Much older.<br> Yes, and there's a<br> very good reason for that, isn't there?<br> She likes people with a bit of a past.<br> She uses them... Don't you?<br> No I don't.<br> For your novel, don't you Iris?<br> -I haven't read it<br> -Haven't you?<br> Neither have you Maurice, so don't play games.<br> Nobody reads it.<br> The gentle lady hasn't yet<br> bestowed her favour on anyone.<br> Iris doesn't like to talk about it. Do you Iris?<br> It's because it's full of people she knows.<br> All these masters of thought<br> you're so chummy with.<br> Bound to be. We all know. Isn't it, Iris?<br> No. You can think what you like,<br> you know nothing about it.<br> Nobody knows but me.<br> And -- I'm not telling.<br> I thought it was as secret?<br> I know Iris doesn't want it talked about.<br> Come on, Iris,<br> I'm sure we'll all recognise ourselves.<br> I don't see how you -- anyone can.<br> They won't. They won't.<br> I hate that sort of thing. I won't ever do it.<br> I don't see the point<br> of writing a novel that's autobiography.<br> There's no fun in that.<br> They won't see themselves.<br> Don't people written about in novels<br> always see themselves differently?<br> -I'm sure they do, but...<br> -And who was it who said:<br> "You can use anyone you like in a novel...<br> ...as long as you<br> drop it in somewhere that they're good in bed...<br> -...even though..."<br> -...they might not be.<br> Evelyn Waugh.<br> "And so to bed." Samuel Pepys.<br> So, have you granted your favour to John?<br> Told him who's in the novel?<br> We have other things to talk about.<br> No-one has read my novel.<br> -No-one but the publisher.<br> -It doesn't matter.<br> Well, it does matter, I feel let down.<br> Am I not a small part of your life?<br> You were very gallant.<br> Very stupid.<br> No, John.<br> Will you come in?<br> Have you been entertained?<br> Yes.<br> All these people...<br> ...and to think I chose you<br> for your obvious lack of...<br> thought that... I thought no competition.<br> What's this?<br> A friend made it.<br> Is she a cook, your friend?<br> No, he's ap hilosopher. But<br> his real interests are cooking and telephones.<br> I'd like you to read this.<br> I was rather afraid you might not like it.<br> Thank you.<br> I value your opinion.<br> Perhaps it's time we made love?<br> Yes?<br> Yes. That's what I thought.<br> Have you got a French letter?<br> A rubber thingy?<br> Oh, good Lord, no.<br> Well...<br> ...we'll just have to be careful.<br> I don't exactly...<br> Probably easier if you take your trousers off.<br> Yes, of course. I've never...<br> I'm a rather late starter.<br> My brother used to have to...<br> ...tie my shoelaces for me till I was seven.<br> -I don't know if...<br> -I do.<br> It'll all go...<br> swimmingly.<br> -Help.<br> -No, no, no.<br> Iris, calm down. No.<br> No. Help, help.<br> I am trying to help you.<br> Sorry.<br> Please don't, Iris.<br> You have nothing to be sorry about.<br> It'd be unfair and I couldn't bear it.<br> We should be saying sorry to you.<br> And not just sorry, but...<br> Shall I read to you? Shall I?<br> Occupied in observing<br> Mr Bingley's attentions to her sister...<br> Elizabeth was far from suspecting...<br> ...that she was herself<br> becoming an object of some interest...<br> ...in the eyes of his friend.<br> Mr Darcy had, at first,<br> scarcely allowed her to be pretty...<br> I wrote.<br> Yes, my darling clever cat.<br> You wrote books.<br> Books. I wrote.<br> You wrote novels.<br> Wonderful novels.<br> I wrote.<br> Such things you wrote.<br> Special things...<br> ...secret things.<br> Do you know many secrets now, Iris?<br> You have shown me a map of Iris'...<br> ...brain world. Empty...<br> You tell me that its hidden mysteries and ...<br> ...and all the unknown life<br> in there has gone, has been wiped.<br> How then...<br> How can she say things<br> with such a terrible lucidity?<br> Which bit of the empty jungle<br> does that come from?<br> -We don't know.<br> -Not we. You don't know.<br> Don't hide, please.<br> Is it not remotely possible...<br> ...that what Iris says<br> is of some consequence, yes?<br> yes, perhaps.<br> So, perhaps we ought to learn her language...<br> ...before the lights go out.<br> The lights -- will go out.<br> Yes, of course they will.<br> You all keep telling me, us, that.<br> I know that. She may even know that herself.<br> Iris.<br> I'm sure you can write it.<br> Just get one word down.<br> Persevere.<br> Iris, your notebook!<br> No, Iris. No, no. Come, come.<br> That's it.<br> we'll walk -- we'll read...<br> ...and then you'll write. Be just like the old days.<br> It's Iris, mama.<br> Look who's here, Iris.<br> Hello. Hello.<br> Yes, Iris, sea.<br> I thought we'd walk, calm her down a bit.<br> She has an idea for a novel.<br> -Hello, Iris.<br> -Hello, Iris.<br> Talk to her, Janet.<br> Hello, Iris. The sea's a bit cold for swimming.<br> Stay as long as you like, there's plenty of room.<br> -We don't want to be nuisance...<br> -Oh, no you're not!<br> It's as much for mum as anyone,<br> give her a bit of a rest.<br> Can't rush around these days,<br> John, tummy trouble.<br> -Is she ill?<br> -She gets tired easily.<br> She's really not...<br> What do we do?<br> Just talk to her.<br> Say things to her<br> that she can write. She can you know.<br> It's all right, is it, John?<br> It'll get better<br> as you get to know each other better.<br> Iris has got more than one world<br> going on inside her head...<br> ...a secret world.<br> Until another book comes out.<br> I'm only friend that knows of her secret world.<br> Oh, John.<br> No, no, it's like living in a fairy story.<br> I'm the young man in love<br> with a beautiful maiden...<br> ...who disappears into an unknown<br> and mysterious world...<br> ...but who always comes back.<br> Iris!<br> Look.<br> Iris, look, he's got his clothes on.<br> He's got his clothes on!<br> He's got his clothes on. He's got his clothes on.<br> Seems very sensible to me.<br> -Janet, are you all right?<br> -I'm absolutely fine, John.<br> I thought I'd get her to sign this.<br> Anything is fine. Just get her to write.<br> Does she know anything about her past?<br> Her career, work, friends?<br> Something of a closed book.<br> But it's there -- I know it.<br> Oh, that's wonderful. Well done, puss.<br> Good to see your book so well received, Iris.<br> Yes, wasn't it?<br> You thought you'd never finish it, didn't you?<br> I read her the reviews.<br> You hated me doing it before.<br> Would you sign your new book for me, Iris?<br> Like postcards, do it at once or you don't.<br> Please?<br> I see an angel.<br> I think it's you.<br> We're undewater now.<br> There are some drugs, aren't there, Iris?<br> But they don't last long.<br> And when the friendly fog disperses...<br> ...there yawns<br> the precipice before you, doesn't it, puss?<br> They're beautiful.<br> Horrible, isn't it, puss?<br> Horrible thing...<br> ...when you're there<br> with your toes at the edge of the precipice.<br> You can say anything you like as...<br> ...long as you make it sound like it's a joke.<br> Oh, don't John, that's cruel.<br> that's where you're wrong.<br> It's not cruel, it's nothing...<br> ...because it's not understood.<br> She's in her own world now.<br> Which is perhaps what she's always wanted.<br> Come on. Let's go in.<br> When do we go?<br> Chin up, John.<br> Janet.<br> Yes, puss. Yes.<br> Going, going. No, I do go.<br> Soon, we'll -- we'll go soon.<br> Now... now.<br> Who is it? Who is it?<br> Hello, hello.<br> Are you there?<br> Where this?<br> ...soars enchanted...<br> As I hear the sweet lark sing<br> In the clear air of the day.<br> How much is that doggy in the window?<br> The one with the waggly tail<br> How much is that doggy in the window?<br> I do hope that doggy's for sale.<br> Sing your mother's song.<br> Sing your mother's song.<br> All my soul's adoration.<br> And I think he will hear me.<br> ...soars enchanted<br> I hear the sweet lark sing...<br> ...of the day.<br> It is this that gives my soul.<br> All its joyous elation<br> As I hear the sweet lark sing<br> In the clear air...<br> ...of the day.<br> Dear thoughts are in my mind<br> And my soul soars enchanted.<br> As I hear the sweet lark sing<br> In the clear air of the day.<br> For a tender beaming smile...<br> ...to my hope has been granted<br> And tomorrow he shall hear...<br> ...all my fond heart can say<br> As I hear the sweet lark sing...<br> ...in the...<br> Come, gentlemen...<br> ...we shall have to do better than this.<br> aren't you a bad cat?<br> And tomorrow he shall hear...<br> ...all my fond heart can say<br> Teletubbies!<br> Morning.<br> Morning. Oh thank you.<br> -Okay. Bye.<br> -Than kyou. Bye.<br> It's only the postman.<br> Time for teletubbies -- Time for Teletubbies.<br> Tinky winky Tinky Winky<br> It's only the postman.<br> It'sonlythepostman.<br> It's only the postman.<br> It's only the postman.<br> Where have the Teletubbies gone?<br> remember Proteus?<br> -What about Proteus?<br> -I'm like Proteus.<br> You've got to keep hold of me<br> the way Hercules kept hold of him.<br> Even thought he changed into...<br> ... a lion and a fish...<br> ...and a snake.<br> I'm worried about the river, we swim.<br> You never know, sir.<br> I have, of course,<br> looked everywhere here already.<br> Everything you do...<br> ...everything you say, write...<br> ...you do it superbly.<br> And you're always going to, all your life...<br> ...whatever you turn your hand to. I know it.<br> And I know you must feel<br> that I don't belong in your world.<br> I don't.<br> Between the soup and the baked beans.<br> Thank you so much.<br> I caught her before she got to the check-out.<br> She's been gone for hours...<br> ..I thought I'd never see her again. Never.<br> Well... all's well that...<br> Please do, tell me your name?<br> I'm Maurice, John.<br> Iris' friend.<br> I was a witness at your wedding.<br> Well, I'm late for a meeting.<br> -Maurice, so sorry...<br> -So sorry.<br> Were you trying to get away from me?<br> Did you want to leave me, Iris?<br> Please?<br> I feel as if I don't know anything about you.<br> When you know<br> everything about me, then I'll be dead.<br> He's a Professor of Ancient History..<br> They have a maling influence on you I think.<br> They all have, all your 'friends'.<br> He's a teacher, a master of thought.<br> You talk, do you. You master thoughts together?<br> We make love, yes,<br> but that's not the important thing.<br> Then he goes home to his wife in London.<br> Does it frighten you?<br> I feel as if I'm standing in a long line of suitors...<br> ...waiting for a kind word.<br> I'll always give you a kind word.<br> We must accept me as I am.<br> And I'm to be kept in my box or not kept at all.<br> Nothing matters except...<br> ...loving what is good.<br> Am I good?<br> Just...<br> ...keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right.<br> Who are you with now, Iris?<br> Who is it?<br> We're lost.<br> We're lost. We're lost...<br> There is no reason for this.<br> And if there is I don't know it.<br> I hate you Iris. You stupid cow.<br> I bloody loathe you.<br> Every bloody inch of you.<br> All your friends have finished with you.<br> Nobody else has you anymore...<br> ...except your fucking best friend<br> Doctor fucking Alzheimer....<br> ...with all his fucking gifts.<br> I've got you now and I don't want you.<br> I've never known anything about you at all...<br> ...and now I don't care.<br> I think it's time I told you about...<br> ...some of my friends...<br> ...the people in my past -- of my heart and...<br> ...and not.<br> Oh dear.<br> ought I to take notes?<br> There was a friend who was a student with me.<br> No, no, he can wait.<br> He was not the first person I went to bed with...<br> ...that was Harry..<br> then there was Roger,<br> who wanted to marry me...<br> And Oscar<br> who said he couldn't live without me...<br> ...and Tom...<br> ...who far too clearly could but...<br> So, the student friend<br> I had resisted going to bed with...<br> ...joined the Army during the war....<br> ...and promptly asked me to marry him for...<br> ...he was certain he was going to be killed...<br> ..and wanted me to have the window's pension.<br> Yes, I know they all said that.<br> Anyway...<br> ...I didn't want to marry him...<br> ...but I did go to bed with him.<br> ...I thought that best before<br> he went off to fight, because you never know...<br> ...anyway, he, he was killed--<br> --my student friend...<br> ...and we weren't married.<br> So no pension.<br> there.<br> It wouldn't have been much anyway...<br> I know, because I had friends killed.<br> Their wives got very little, they get very little.<br> Is that all? I mean, roughly?<br> What about the 'friends' in your other world?<br> You know more about me than anyone on earth.<br> You are my world.<br> Thank you.<br> After all that I rather hoped it might be time...<br> ...for me to get my kind word.<br> You don't need to do it on your own.<br> Vale House is very good.<br> You're exhausted, you know that.<br> Of course I am. It's something that we share.<br> We're in a state of grace.<br> I think we understand each other.<br> What do you think?<br> I don'tknow. There's always help if you need it.<br> There isn't any help for her.<br> What?<br> Sorry? Sorry?<br> Nothing.<br> Why has Willie Thorne<br> got two rabbits tattooed on his bald head?<br> I don't know, why has Willie Thorne<br> got two rabbits tattooed on his bald head?<br> Cos from a distance they look like hares.<br> Janet's dead, Iris.<br> They want me to say a few words<br> but I can't think of any.<br> Janet's dead, Iris.<br> I miss Janet very much.<br> I miss Janet because I used to store up...<br> ...funny things to tell her that happened to us.<br> ...things I can no longer tell Iris.<br> Another friend visited us...<br> ...in Oxford overnight recently....<br> ...and I found her cleaning the bath.<br> I said, "Oh, please, there's no need".<br> She said, "Oh yes there is,<br> I want to take a bath".<br> I was hoping to be able...<br> ...to tell Janet that story...<br> ...she would have enjoyed it.<br> She would have...laughed.<br> I mean, I think...<br> ...Anna Karenina, Tolstoy, you know...<br> ...when on her way to the station<br> to throw herself under a train...<br> ...sees something funny<br> which she thinks to tell Vronsky....<br> ...her lover, about...<br> ...we all do it, I do it with Iris...<br> ...and Janet, all our friends...<br> ...but, then Anna thought that<br> she wouldn't be seeing Vronsky again...<br> ...because she was about to kill herself.<br> Oh, but, you don't want to hear this...<br> ...Janet didn't kill herself...<br> But, if there's one thing<br> that would have prevented...<br> ...Anna from throwing herself under a train...<br> ...that would be it,<br> the thought of telling something funny...<br> ...to the man she loves.<br> The love is over...<br> ...though...<br> ...life will...<br> ...soon be over.<br> That's all.<br> Goodbye, Janet.<br> No, no, Janet. Jan!<br> It's all right, Iris.<br> Wrong, wrong, wrong.<br> -Wrong driving.<br> Stop it, Iris!<br> Wrong driving!<br> No. Stop it, Iris.<br> -Not house. Not mother..<br> -Iris, it's very dangerous.<br> Them! Them!<br> Iris!<br> Puss.<br> My old mouse -- My old cat mouse.<br> Where are you?<br> I...<br> ...love...<br> ...you.<br> Ah, little mouse.

Well, we must make a start.<br> -What do I do?<br> -Nothing any more.<br> Vale House is a very friendly place, you know.<br> I was, surpr....<br> ...I mean, this is one of the best.<br> More difficult to get into than...well, Eton.<br> -Taxi for Vale House?<br> -Yes.<br> Lady's on the stairs, but I can't get her down.<br> Shall I?<br> You all right, my love?<br> We're going for a little drive.<br> What's your name then?<br> Iris.<br> Yes, it's Iris.<br> All right then, Iris...<br> ...you'll be all right, my love, come on.<br> Come on, upsy-daisy.<br> There you go.<br> Lovely.<br> Human beings love each...<br> ...in sex -- in friendship...<br> ...and when they're in love.<br> And they cherish other beings...<br> ...humans -- animals, plants...<br> ...even stones.<br> She'll be fine now, won't you Iris?<br> You can visit any time you like...<br> ...come all day if you want to.<br> Stay the night, that's all right...<br> ...we can make arrangements<br> for you to do that anytime.<br> It was so quiet...<br> ...when she died.<br> Do you know,<br> I thought I wouldn't mind doing that myself..<br> I had a joke to tell her.<br> It wasn't a very good one<br> but she'd have laughed.<br> We need to believe in something divine.<br> Without the need for God.<br> Something we might call love...<br> ...or goodness.<br> As the psalm says...<br> ..."Whither shall I go from thy spirit...<br> ...whither shall I flee from thy presence?<br> If I ascend unto Heaven thou art there...<br> ...if I make my bed in Hell behold thou art there.<br> If I take the wings of the morning...<br> ...and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea...<br> ...even there shall thy hand lead me...<br> ...and thy right hand shall hold me."<br>
