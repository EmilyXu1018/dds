I'll have something to say<br> about that and so will King.<br> I expect him to.<br> The vittles. Come in.<br> I told you not to bring any food in here.<br> Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.<br> Put it down here.<br> Smart, aren't you? So subtle.<br> Strategy, my dear.<br> Was it strategy sending<br> those gorillas to drag me away...<br> ...from the Justice of the Peace?<br> Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.<br> I've won many arguments that way.<br> Besides not liking him,<br> you haven't got a thing against King.<br> - He's a fake.<br> - He's one of the best flyers in the country.<br> He's no good.<br> You married him because I said not to.<br> You're always telling me what not to do.<br> Because you've always been a stubborn idiot.<br> I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.<br> Don't shout so. You may work up an appetite.<br> I'll shout if I want to!<br> I'll scream if I want to!<br> All right, scream.<br> Let me off this boat or I'll break<br> every piece of furniture in here!<br> Here, now.<br> Have a nice piece of juicy steak.<br> You don't have to eat it.<br> Just smell it. It's a poem.<br> Lower the boats! Catch her!<br> Come on, men!<br> She got away, sir.<br> Of course, she's too smart for you.<br> Send a wireless to the Lovington Detective Agency.<br> "Daughter escaped again.<br> "Watch roads, airports and train stations in Miami."<br> All aboard! Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...<br> ...New York, Philadelphia.<br> We're wasting our time.<br> Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.<br> I told the old man it was bunk.<br> Ticket for New York, please.<br> - Here's your ticket.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Thank you.<br> What's going on here?<br> I'd like to use that phone.<br> Go away. This is history in the making.<br> - What?<br> - There's a man biting a dog in there.<br> Heel, boy.<br> I can't stand this any longer.<br> In a pig's eye, you will.<br> Listen monkey face, when you fired me,<br> you fired the best news hound...<br> ...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.<br> You wouldn't know a newspaper story<br> if it kicked you in the pants.<br> I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell<br> me you were gonna write it in Greek?<br> I'd start a new department.<br> That was free verse, you gas house palooka.<br> What was free about it?<br> It cost this paper a gob of dough.<br> And it's not going to cost us any more!<br> Gordon.<br> Did you know he reversed the charge?<br> What? Why you...<br> When you get back to New York,<br> you keep far away from this office.<br> You're fired. You don't work here<br> anymore and you never will.<br> What'd he say?<br> So, you're changing your tune?<br> You're late with your apologies.<br> I wouldn't go back to work for you<br> if you begged me on your hands and knees!<br> I hope this'll be a lesson to you.<br> Did we tell that baby?<br> - We don't need anymore of his lip.<br> - You told him, Pete.<br> I guess he knows now,<br> how I feel about his job.<br> I bet he does, too.<br> Is my chariot ready?<br> Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, mighty King.<br> - Lead on, sire.<br> - Make way for the king.<br> Make way for the king.<br> Long live the king.<br> Philadelphia, all aboard!<br> Step down Marty, King is back.<br> On the rack in the back.<br> It's your goodbye chariot.<br> Make hams of you and scram!<br> Two thousand miles is a long trip.<br> Make yourself comfortable<br> with a pleasant pillow.<br> Pillow, sir?<br> Driver! If you'll be good enough to move<br> those newspapers, I'll have a seat.<br> Hey, wait a minute!<br> What do you think you're doing?<br> The papers. What's the idea of throwing them out?<br> The papers? It's a long story, my friend.<br> I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers.<br> I did it once, and all the headlines<br> came off on my white pants.<br> It actually happened.<br> Nobody bought a paper that day.<br> They followed me all over town and read<br> the news off the seat of my pants.<br> A fresh guy. What you need is<br> a good sock on the nose.<br> Listen partner,<br> you may not like my nose, but I do.<br> I always wear it out in the open so...<br> ...if anybody wants to<br> take a sock at it, they can.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Now, that's a brilliant answer.<br> Why didn't I think of it?<br> Our conversation could have been over long ago.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> If you keep that up, we won't get anywhere.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> You got me. Yeah!<br> Excuse me, lady.<br> But that upon which you sit is mine.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Now listen,<br> I put up a stiff fight for that seat.<br> So, if it's just the same to you, scram.<br> Driver, are these seats reserved?<br> - No. First come, first serve.<br> - Thank you.<br> These seats accommodate two<br> people, don't they?<br> Maybe they do, maybe they don't.<br> Thank you.<br> Move over.<br> This is a "maybe they do."<br> If you'd ask me real nice,<br> I might put that bag up there for you.<br> Next time you drop in, bring your folks.<br> Get some! Come on, everybody!<br> Hot dogs, folks!<br> Rest station, 15 minutes.<br> We'll only be here 15 minutes.<br> Red hot coffee!<br> Right around there.<br> Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!<br> Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!<br> He got away.<br> I found myself in the middle of<br> brush and no sign of the skunk.<br> I don't know what you're<br> raving about, young man.<br> - Furthermore, I'm not interested.<br> - Well of all the...<br> Maybe you'll be interested<br> to know your bag is gone.<br> My heavens! It's gone!<br> I knew you'd catch on eventually.<br> - What am I going to do now?<br> - Don't tell me your ticket was in it.<br> No, got that all right. But not my money.<br> All I have here is $4.<br> You can wire home<br> for money in Jacksonville.<br> No, I can't.<br> - Yes, I guess I will.<br> - I'll tell the driver about your bag.<br> Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.<br> Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.<br> The company should pay for it.<br> - What's your name?<br> - I don't want it reported!<br> That's ridiculous.<br> The company will take care of it.<br> Can you understand English?<br> Would you please keep out of my affairs?<br> I want to be left alone.<br> Why, you ungrateful brat.<br> Board!<br> All aboard!<br> Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.<br> Only 30 minutes for breakfast.<br> Just 30 minutes.<br> That's all. No more.<br> Read all about it!<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Silly, isn't it?<br> Why, everybody's gone!<br> Thank you for that, very much.<br> - We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?<br> - Yes.<br> That was foolish of me.<br> Why didn't you shove me away?<br> I hated to wake you up.<br> You look kind of pretty asleep.<br> How about some breakfast?<br> No thank you. No, I'm going<br> to the Windsor Hotel.<br> Windsor? You'll never make it in time.<br> We leave in a half an hour.<br> No, they'll wait for me.<br> Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes<br> late. Be sure to wait for me.<br> Yeah?<br> Yes.<br> Where's the bus to New York?<br> It left about 20 minutes ago.<br> But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.<br> I told them to wait.<br> I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.<br> Good morning. Remember me?<br> I'm the fellow you slept on last night.<br> Seems to me, I've already thanked you for that.<br> What time's the next bus?<br> Sorry, miss.<br> What's the matter?<br> Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?<br> What are you so excited about?<br> You missed it, too.<br> Yeah, I missed it too.<br> Don't tell me you did it on my account.<br> I hope you haven't any idea<br> that what happened last night is...<br> Now look here young man,<br> you needn't concern yourself about me.<br> I can take care of myself.<br> You're doing a pretty sloppy<br> job of it. Here's your ticket.<br> My ticket?<br> I found it on the seat.<br> Thank you.<br> It must have fallen out of my purse.<br> You'll never get away with it,<br> Miss Andrews.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I said you'd never get away with it.<br> Your father will stop you before<br> you get halfway to New York.<br> You must have me confused<br> with someone else.<br> Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.<br> I've always been curious to know...<br> ...what kind of a girl would marry<br> a front-page aviator like King Westley.<br> Take my advice. Grab the next bus<br> back to Miami. That guy's a phoney.<br> I didn't ask for your advice.<br> That's right. You didn't.<br> You're not going to notify my father,<br> are you?<br> What for?<br> You probably could get<br> some money out of him.<br> I never thought of that.<br> If you promise not to do it,<br> I'll pay you as much as he will.<br> You won't gain a thing by giving me away<br> as long as I'm willing<br> to make it worth your while.<br> I've got to get to New York<br> without being stopped.<br> It's terribly important to me.<br> I'd pay you now, only...<br> ...all I had when I jumped off<br> the yacht was a wrist watch.<br> I had to pawn it to get these clothes.<br> I'll give you my address.<br> You can contact me in New York.<br> Never mind.<br> I had you pegged right from the jump.<br> Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.<br> The only way you get anything is to buy it.<br> You're in a jam and all you can think of<br> is your money. It never fails, does it?<br> Ever hear of the word "humility"?<br> No, you wouldn't.<br> It never occurred to you to say...<br> ..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.<br> Will you help me?"<br> That'd bring you down off your high horse.<br> I'll tell you something to ease your mind.<br> You don't have to worry about me.<br> I'm not interested in your<br> money or your problem.<br> You, King Westley, your father.<br> You're all a lot of hooey to me.<br> You send telegrams here?<br> I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?<br> "To Joe Gordon,<br> in care of New York Mail, New York.<br> "Am I laughing. The biggest scoop<br> of the year just dropped in my lap.<br> "I know where Ellen Andrews is."<br> No, do you really?<br> Go on. Send the telegram.<br> "How would you like to have the story?<br> You big tub of..."<br> Mush.<br> "Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.<br> "What I said about never writing<br> another line for you still goes.<br> "Are you burning? Peter Warne."<br> That'll be $2.60.<br> - Send it collect.<br> - Collect?<br> Collect.<br> Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,<br> Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...<br> ...Washington, Baltimore,<br> Philadelphia, New York...<br> Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.<br> May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.<br> Gets tiresome. Especially for somebody like you.<br> You look like you've got class.<br> Yes sir, with a capital "K". I'm the guy<br> that knows class when he sees it.<br> Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.<br> They'll tell you.<br> Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em.<br> Yes sir. Shapeley's the name<br> and that's the way I like 'em.<br> You made no mistake sitting next to me.<br> Just between us, the kind<br> of mugs you meet on the bus...<br> ...ain't nothing to write home<br> to the wife about.<br> You gotta be awful careful<br> who you hit it up with.<br> You can't be too particular, neither.<br> What's the matter, you ain't saying much?<br> Seems to me you're doing excellently<br> without any assistance.<br> That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're<br> doing excellently without any assistance."<br> Well shut my big, nasty mouth.<br> Looks like you're one up on me.<br> There's nothing I like better<br> than to meet a high-class mama...<br> ...that can snap back at you.<br> The colder they are, the hotter they get.<br> That's what I always say.<br> Yes, sir.<br> When a cold mama gets hot,<br> boy how she sizzles.<br> Now you're just my type.<br> Believe me, sister,<br> I could go for you in a big way.<br> "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.<br> With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.<br> Believe you me,<br> you bore me to distraction.<br> Looks like you're two up on me now.<br> Hey, you.<br> - There's a seat over there for you.<br> - What's the idea?<br> I'd like to sit next to my wife,<br> if you don't mind.<br> - Your wife?<br> - Yes.<br> Come on.<br> Yeah. Sure, excuse me.<br> You know, I was just...<br> Sure. Excuse me, miss.<br> I was just trying to make things pleasant.<br> Excuse me, I...<br> I didn't mean anything, Doc.<br> - No offence, Doc.<br> - No.<br> If you promise not to snap my head off,<br> I'd like to thank you.<br> Forget it. I didn't do it for you.<br> His voice gets on my nerves.<br> What'd you do all day?<br> Ran in and out of doorways.<br> Trying to keep out of the rain.<br> Your clothes are all wet.<br> Here.<br> You're as helpless as a baby.<br> Thank you.<br> Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,<br> chewing gum, candy, magazines.<br> Here, boy.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - A box of chocolates, please.<br> - Never mind. She doesn't want it.<br> - But...<br> - Of course, I do. What do you mean?<br> - Beat it.<br> Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!<br> $1.60.<br> You had $4 last night.<br> How will you get to New York at this rate?<br> That's none of your business.<br> You're on a budget from now on.<br> - Just a minute. You can't...<br> - Shut up.<br> - What's the matter, officer?<br> - Bridge washed out.<br> Looks like we can't get through<br> till morning.<br> If any passengers want a place to sleep...<br> ...you'll find an auto camp<br> up yonder a piece.<br> - Where?<br> - Right over there. See those lights?<br> Dyke's Auto camp.<br> All right, thanks. Hey, brat.<br> Are you talking to me?<br> Yeah. Come on,<br> we're stopping here for the night.<br> Hey! Come on, we're all set.<br> Good evening. Hope you<br> and your husband rest comfortable.<br> Come on! What are you going to do,<br> stay out there all night?<br> Darn clever, these Armenians?<br> Yeah, it's a gift.<br> I just had the unpleasant sensation<br> of hearing you referred to as my husband.<br> Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.<br> I registered as Mr. And Mrs.<br> You did?<br> What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?<br> I kind of half expected you to thank me.<br> Your ego is absolutely colossal.<br> Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?<br> You know, compared to you,<br> my friend Shapeley's an amateur.<br> Just whatever gave you any idea<br> I'd stand for this?<br> Now wait a minute.<br> Let's get this straightened out right now.<br> If you're nursing any silly notion<br> that I'm interested in you, forget it.<br> You're just a headline to me.<br> A headline?<br> You're not a newspaper man, are you?<br> Chalk up one for your side.<br> Now listen.

Including this.<br> This? Well, that's a matter<br> of simple mathematics.<br> These cabins cost $2 a night.<br> I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...<br> ...but the family purse won't stand<br> for our having separate establishment.<br> Thank you very much, sir.<br> You've been very kind.<br> It's all right with me.<br> Go on out in the storm.<br> But I'm going to follow you.<br> Yeah.<br> And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn<br> you over to your old man.

Peter Warne.<br> Peter Warne.<br> I don't like it.<br> Don't let it bother you.<br> You're giving it back to me in the morning.<br> Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.<br> The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.<br> - Another message, sir.<br> - What is it? What is it?<br> It's from Charleston.<br> "Checking every northbound train.<br> "Also assigned 20 operators<br> to watch main highways.<br> "No sign of her yet.<br> Will continue to do all possible.<br> "Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."<br> It's just the same as all the others.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.<br> - What are we crawling for?<br> - I got it wide open.<br> - All right, step on it.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I hope she's all right.<br> All right? Of course, she's all right.<br> What could happen to her?<br> - Nothing, sir.<br> - Then shut up about it.<br> Hello?<br> Hey, mister.<br> Hello.<br> What's the matter, you not up yet?<br> - What time is it?<br> - 8:00. Here.<br> It's a toothbrush, thanks.<br> My dress, you had it pressed.<br> Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.<br> You sweet thing.<br> Where'd you get it pressed?<br> I'll count to 10.<br> If you're not out of bed by then...<br> ...l'll drag you out myself.<br> - One, two, three, four, five...<br> - I really think you would!<br> I'm out! I'm out!<br> You'll find the showers<br> just behind the second cottage.<br> Outside?<br> All the best homes have them outside.<br> I can't go out like this.<br> - Like what?<br> - Like this. I have no robe.<br> Here, use mine.<br> Thanks.<br> Make it snappy.<br> Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.<br> - Here are my puppets.<br> - Thanks.<br> Where'd you say the showers were?<br> Here's a towel.<br> Thank you.<br> You're kind of little, aren't you?<br> Where's the shower?<br> Your hair's cute like that.<br> You should never comb it.<br> I'll find it myself.<br> Are the showers in there?<br> They ain't out here.<br> Thank you.<br> Can't a body have a little privacy<br> around here?<br> You want a shower around here,<br> you'll stand in line.<br> Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?<br> Say, I'm sorry about last night.<br> Didn't know you was married to that guy.<br> You should've told me right off.<br> High time you got back.<br> I met some very interesting women<br> at the showers.<br> We got chatting about this and that.<br> You know how time flies.<br> Come on. Sit down.<br> My, my. Scrambled eggs.<br> Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.<br> That's your ration till lunch.<br> Any complaints?<br> No. No complaints.<br> I'd have cream for your coffee,<br> but I'd be buying a whole pint.<br> You don't have to apologise to me.<br> You don't know how much<br> I appreciate all this.<br> What makes you so disgustingly<br> cheerful this morning?<br> Must be the spring.<br> I thought maybe "believe you me"<br> told you some more snappy stories.<br> No. He apologised for last night.<br> Said he didn't know we were married.<br> Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.<br> - Donut?<br> - Thanks.<br> You think this whole business is silly?<br> Running away and all.<br> No. Makes too good a story.<br> Yes, you do.<br> You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.<br> Perhaps I am.<br> Although, I don't see how I can be.<br> Spoiled people are used to<br> having their way.<br> I never have. On the contrary.<br> I've always been told what to do and how<br> to do it and when and with whom.<br> Can you believe, this is the first time<br> I've ever been alone with a man?<br> Yeah.<br> It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.<br> You're doing all right.<br> Thanks.<br> Nurses, governesses, chaperones,<br> even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.<br> One consolation,<br> you can never get lonesome.<br> It has its moments. It's become a sort of<br> game, trying to outwit father's detectives.<br> I did once. Actually went shopping<br> without a bodyguard.<br> It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.<br> It didn't last long,<br> they found me in a department store.<br> I was so mad, I ran out the back way<br> and jumped into the first car I saw.<br> Guess who was in it?<br> Santa Claus?<br> Gandhi?<br> King Westley was in it.<br> - Is that how you met him?<br> - Yes.<br> We rode around all afternoon.<br> Father was frantic.<br> By 6:00,<br> he was having all the rivers dragged.<br> Where'd you learn to dunk,<br> in finishing school?<br> Now don't you start telling me<br> I shouldn't dunk.<br> Of course you shouldn't.<br> You don't know how.<br> Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.<br> A dip and sock, into your mouth.<br> You leave it in too long,<br> it gets soft and falls off.<br> It's all a matter of timing.<br> I'll write a book about it.<br> Thanks, professor.<br> Just goes to show you. $20 million,<br> and you don't know how to dunk.<br> I'd change places with<br> a plumber's daughter any day.<br> How do I know who you are?<br> I never saw you before.<br> You can't go around bothering my tenants.<br> There's no girl by that name here.<br> How do I know you're detectives?<br> Show him your credentials, Mac.<br> Detectives.<br> That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?<br> Maybe I can jump out of the window.<br> They won't see me.<br> Get yourself all mussed up.<br> Get your hair down over your eyes<br> and undo your buttons.<br> I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.<br> She said if we don't stop over<br> in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.<br> What are you talking about?<br> The baby's due next month.<br> They want us to come.<br> She saw your sister on the street<br> the other day. Said she's looking swell.<br> Come in.<br> I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?<br> Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.<br> She hasn't missed calling one in years.<br> Man here to see you, sweetheart.<br> Who, me? You wanna see me?<br> What's your name?<br> - Are you addressing me?<br> - Yeah. What's your name?<br> Wait a minute.<br> That's my wife you're talking to.<br> What do you mean coming here?<br> What do you want?<br> - We're looking for somebody.<br> - Fine, but don't come busting in here.<br> This isn't a public park.<br> I got news to take a sock at you.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - The men are detectives.<br> Even if they're the<br> whole police department...<br> ...they can't bust in here,<br> questioning my wife.<br> Don't get so excited.<br> He asked you a simple question.<br> Is that so? How many times<br> have I told you not to butt in?<br> You don't have to lose your temper!<br> As usual. Every time I try to protect you.<br> At the elks dance,<br> when that big Swede hit on you.<br> He did not! I told you a million times.<br> He kept pawing you<br> all over the dance floor.<br> He didn't. You were drunk.<br> Nuts! Just like your old man.<br> Once a plumber's daughter,<br> always a plumber's daughter.<br> There ain't an ounce of<br> brains in your family.<br> Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!<br> - Shut up!<br> - You see what you've done?<br> Sorry, but you see,<br> we've gotta check up on everybody.<br> We're looking for a girl<br> named Ellen Andrews.<br> Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.<br> Too bad you're not looking for<br> a plumber's daughter.<br> Quit bawling!<br> I told you they were a perfectly<br> nice married couple.<br> You weren't bad, jumping in like that.<br> - You've got a brain.<br> - You're not so bad, yourself.<br> We could start a two-people<br> stock company.<br> Things get tough,<br> we'll play to small town auditoriums.<br> We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."<br> What about "Cinderella" or<br> a real hot love story?<br> No, too mushy.<br> I like mushy stuff.<br> Quit bawling!<br> Bus leaves in five minutes!<br> - What?<br> - Your bus leaves in five minutes.<br> Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.<br> I'm starting to think<br> you couldn't find your way home.<br> This is the last session...<br> - Yeah?<br> - Telegram for you.<br> - Bring it in.<br> - Another wire from Peter Warne.<br> Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.<br> Wait a minute. What does it say?<br> "Have I got a story. Stop.<br> It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.<br> "Hope you're the same."<br> - Collect?<br> - Yes.<br> - If you accept another one, you're fired.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And that gives me an idea for all of you.<br> I want action, Lovington, action.<br> - We can't do the impossible.<br> - It isn't impossible.<br> She's somewhere between here and Miami.<br> I want her found.<br> - I put extra men on, the whole way.<br> - That's not enough.<br> Send in Clark and Brown.<br> - You sure she isn't with King Westley?<br> - No.<br> He's being trailed 24 hours a day.<br> He can't even get a phone call<br> we don't know about.<br> I'm worried. After all,<br> something might have happened to her.<br> I don't think so.<br> Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.<br> Coast-to-coast hook up.<br> Offer a reward of...<br> ...$10,000 for information<br> on her whereabouts.<br> Clark, send the story<br> to all of the newspapers.<br> Some out-of-town papers<br> may not have a picture of her.<br> Wire this to them.<br> I want the story to break right away.<br> Now we'll get some action!<br> Fine, that's fine.<br> You know that one<br> about the man who flew on the trapeze?<br> Yeah.<br> Once I was happy but now I'm forlorn<br> Like an old coat that is tattered and torn<br> Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn<br> Betrayed by a maid in her teens<br> This maid that I loved she was handsome<br> And I tried all I knew how to please<br> But I never could please her one-quarter so well<br> As the man on the flying trapeze<br> He flies through the air<br> with the greatest of ease<br> The daring young man on the flying trapeze<br> His actions are graceful,<br> all the girls he does please<br> And my love he has stolen away<br> I know the second verse there.<br> Now he'd play with a miss<br> like a cat with a mouse<br> His eyes would undress every girl in the house<br> Perhaps he is better described as a louse<br> And still people came just the same<br> Now he smiles from the bar on the people below<br> And one night he smiled on my love<br> She blew him a kiss<br> And she hollered bravo<br> And he hung by his schnozzle from above<br> He floats through the air<br> with the greatest of ease<br> Daring young man on the flying trapeze<br> His actions are graceful<br> All the girls he does please<br> And my love he has stolen away<br> Do you mind if I take the third one?<br> I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks<br> While she spent her time<br> with the circus' freaks<br> The tears were like hailstones<br> that rolled down my cheeks<br> Alas, Alack and Alaska<br> I went to this fellow the villain, and I said<br> I'll see that you get your desserts<br> His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer<br> He sneered once again and said no<br> He flies through the air<br> with the greatest of ease<br> That daring young man on the flying trapeze<br> His actions are graceful<br> The girls he does please<br> My love he has stolen away<br> - Everybody keep your seats.<br> - Thank the man for me, Peter.<br> It's the first comfortable position<br> I've been in all night.<br> She flies through the air<br> with the greatest of ease<br> The daring young...<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Somebody help.<br> Something happened to her.<br> Look how pale she is.<br> Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.<br> Don't worry. She'll be all right.<br> We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.<br> What happened to your money?<br> Ma spent it all on the tickets.<br> We didn't know it was gonna be so much.<br> We shouldn't have come, I guess.<br> But Ma said there was a job<br> waiting for her in New York...<br> ...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.<br> She'll be all right<br> when she's had something to eat.<br> The next time we come to,<br> you buy some food. Now come on.<br> I shouldn't ought to take this.<br> Ma'll get mad.<br> Don't tell her.<br> You don't want her to get sick again.<br> No, but you might need it.<br> Come on.<br> I got millions.<br> Here.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Come on, go back.<br> Better phone for some help.<br> Go phone if you want to.<br> The nearest town is 10 miles away.<br> Yeah?<br> Say, buddy.<br> Like to take a look at my paper?<br> Travelling like this, you lose track<br> of what's going on in the world.<br> Take that story there, for instance.<br> If I was to see that dame,<br> you know what I'd do?<br> No.<br> I'd go fifty-fifty with you.<br> Why?<br> Because I don't believe in hogging.<br> A bird that figures that way<br> always ends up behind the eight ball.<br> That's what I always say.<br> What's on your mind?<br> Five G's or I crab the works.<br> Let's get away from here<br> and talk this over privately.<br> I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.<br> Lucky thing, my running into you.<br> Just the man I need.<br> - You made no mistake, believe you me.<br> - I can use a smart guy like you.<br> - When you're talking to old man Shapeley...<br> - Can you make a gat?<br> Huh?<br> A gat. A rod.<br> - Got any fireworks on you?<br> - No.<br> I got a couple of machine guns in my<br> suitcase. I'll give you one of them.<br> May have trouble up north.<br> Have to shoot it out with the cops.<br> If you manage, those five G's<br> are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.<br> I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.<br> Killer?<br> Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.<br> You're not kidnapping her, are you?<br> What else, stupid? You don't think<br> we're after that penny-ante reward?<br> $10,000? Chicken feed.<br> Now listen, we're holding that<br> dame for a million smackers.<br> Say, I didn't know it was anything<br> like this. You see, I've got...<br> What's the matter? You getting yellow?<br> I'm a married man. I got a couple<br> of kids. I can't afford to get...<br> Pipe down your mug before I...<br> What are you trying to do,<br> tell the whole world about it?<br> Listen, you're into this thing<br> and you're staying in, get me?<br> You know too much.<br> I won't say anything, honest I won't.<br> How do I know that? I got a notion to plug you.<br> - Why should I take a chance with you?<br> - Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.<br> Yeah?<br> What's your name?<br> Oscar Shapeley.<br> - Where do you live?<br> - Orange, New Jersey.<br> Got a couple of kids?<br> Yes, sir. Just babies.<br> A little golden-haired girl.<br> - You love them, don't you?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> You wouldn't. You're not thinking of...<br> - You keep your trap shut, all right?<br> - Sure.<br> - If you don't...<br> - I'll keep my trap shut. I will.<br> You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?<br> Bugs Dooley? No.<br> He was a nice guy, just like you.<br> And he made a big mistake one day.<br> Got a little too talkative.<br> - You know what happened to his kid?<br> - No.<br> I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard<br> about it he blew his brains out.<br> Gee! That's terrible.<br> He had it coming to him.<br> He talked too much. I never talk.<br> I never say a word. Word of honour.<br> I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.<br> Okay. Just remember that.<br> Now beat it.<br> Sure, mister. Thanks.<br> I always knew you guys were...<br> Come on, scram.<br> And stay away from that bus.<br> Sure. Anything you say.<br> - You ain't gonna shoot me in the back, are ya?<br> - If you don't beat it...<br> I'm going.<br> What's wrong?<br> Why do we have to leave the bus?<br> Come on. Don't ask so many questions.<br> Why?<br> Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have<br> frightened him like that.<br> At the rate he's going, he's probably<br> crossed two state lines by this time.<br> Why did we have to leave the bus?<br> When Shapeley stops running,<br> he's going to start thinking, isn't he?<br> I've been doing a little thinking myself.<br> The next town we come to,<br> you better wire your father.<br> What's the matter, are you weakening?<br> No. I was just thinking of you.<br> A starvation diet may not agree with you.<br> Did you give that child all your money?<br> I gave him nothing.<br> You were the big-hearted gal.<br> All the money I had was that ten spot.<br> So I've been thinking<br> you better wire your father.<br> No, sir. I started out for New York<br> and I'm going to get there...<br> ...if I have to starve all the way.<br> Okay.<br> What is this strange power<br> this man Westley has over you women?<br> Here, take these.<br> - Hold on to them. Get up on that log.<br> - That?<br> Get up on the log.<br> I wish you'd stop being playful.<br> So sorry. You know, this is the first<br> time in years I've ridden piggyback.<br> This isn't piggyback.<br> - Of course it is.<br> - You're crazy.<br> I remember distinctly my father<br> taking me for a piggyback ride.<br> - And he carried you like this?<br> - Yes.<br> Your father didn't know beans<br> about piggyback riding.<br> My uncle has four children.<br> I've seen them ride piggyback.<br> I'll bet there isn't a good<br> piggyback rider in your family.<br> I never knew a rich man<br> who could piggyback ride.<br> You're prejudiced.<br> Show me a good piggy backer.<br> I'll show you a real human.<br> Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.<br> A natural born piggy backer.<br> Where do you get off with<br> that stuffed-shirt family of yours?<br> My father was a great piggy backer.<br> Here, hold this a minute.<br> Thank you.<br> How long does this keep up?<br> My feet are killing me.<br> This looks like the best spot.<br> We're not going to sleep out here, are we?<br> I don't know about you, but I'm going<br> to give a good imitation of it.<br> Peter?<br> What?<br> I'm awfully hungry.<br> It's just your imagination.<br> No it isn't.<br> I'm hungry and scared.<br> You can't be hungry<br> and scared both at the same time.<br> Well, I am.<br> If you're scared, it scares the hunger out of you.<br> Not if you're more hungry than scared.<br> All right, you win. Let's forget about it.<br> I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.<br> Holy smoke!<br> Why did I ever get mixed up with you?<br> If I had any sense,<br> I'd be in New York by this time.<br> What about your story?<br> Taking a married woman back to her husband.<br> I turned out to be the prize sucker.<br> All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.<br> I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.<br> - Then take them off.<br> - What?<br> All right, don't take them off.<br> Do what you please, but shut up about it.<br> You're becoming awfully disagreeable lately.<br> You just snap my head off<br> every time I open my mouth.<br> If being with me is so distasteful<br> to you, you can leave.<br> You can leave any time you see fit.<br> Nobody's holding you here.<br> I can get along.<br> Peter?<br> Peter!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I was so scared!<br> What's got into you? I left for a minute<br> to find you something to eat.<br> I know but...<br> Here, eat your head off.<br> I don't want it now.<br> - I thought you said you were hungry.<br> - I was, but...<br> But what?<br> I was so scared, it scared the hunger...<br> Holy jumping catfish. You drive a guy crazy.<br> It's liable to get chilly before morning.<br> Better use this.<br> What are you thinking about?<br> By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> I was just wondering what makes<br> dames like you so dizzy.<br> What did you say we're supposed to be doing?<br> Hitchhiking.<br> You've given me a very good<br> example of the hiking.<br> Where does the hitching come in?<br> It's a little early yet. No cars out.<br> If it's the same to you...<br> ...I'm going to sit right here<br> and wait until they come.<br> You got a toothpick?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I got hay in my teeth.<br> No, I haven't got a toothpick.<br> Here, I got a penknife, though.<br> Now hold still.<br> - Be careful.<br> - All right. Where is it?<br> All right, now hold still.<br> Here. Get it?<br> Thanks.<br> You should have swallowed that.<br> You won't have any breakfast, you know?<br> You needn't rub it in.<br> - What are you eating?<br> - Carrots.<br> - Raw?<br> - Want one?<br> No. Why didn't you get me<br> something I could eat?<br> That's right, I forgot. The idea<br> of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.<br> You don't think I'm going around<br> panhandling for you, do you?<br> Have one of these.<br> Best thing for you, carrots.<br> I hate the horrid things.<br> I wish you wouldn't talk so much.<br> Now we let a car get away.<br> And suppose nobody stops for us?<br> They'll stop all right. It's a matter<br> of knowing how to handle them.<br> And you're an expert I suppose.<br> Expert. And I'll write a book<br> about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."<br> There's no end to your accomplishments,<br> is there?<br> - You think it's simple?<br> - No.<br> Well, it is simple.<br> It's all in that old thumb, see?<br> Some people do it like this. Or like this.<br> All wrong. Never get anywhere.<br> The poor things.<br> But that old thumb never fails.<br> It's all a matter of how you do it, though.<br> Now you take No. 1, for instance.<br> That's a short jerky movement, like this.<br> That shows independence.<br> You don't care if they stop or not.<br> You got money.<br> - Clever.<br> - No. 2, that's a little wider movement.<br> Smile goes with this one, like this.<br> That means you got a brand-new story<br> about the farmer's daughter.<br> You figured that out all by yourself?<br> That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.<br> That's the pitiful one.<br> When you're broke and hungry,<br> everything looks black.<br> It's a long sweeping movement like this.<br> Gotta follow through, though.<br> That's amazing.<br> But it's no good,<br> if you haven't got a long face to go with it.<br> Here comes a car.<br> Okay. Now watch me.<br> I'm gonna use No. 1.<br> Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,<br> and see what happens.<br> I still got my eye on the thumb.<br> Something must have gone wrong.<br> I'll try No. 2.<br> When you get to 100, wake me up.<br> I don't think I'll write that book after all.<br> Think of all the fun you had, though.<br> You mind if I try?<br> You?<br> Don't make me laugh.<br> You're such a smart aleck.<br> Nobody knows anything but you.<br> I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> It's a system all my own.<br> Aren't you going to give me a little credit?<br> What for?<br> I proved once and for all that<br> the limb is mightier than the thumb.<br> Why didn't you take off all your clothes?<br> You could have stopped 40 cars.<br> I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.<br> So, you're just married?<br> That's pretty good.<br> But if I was young, that's the way<br> I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.<br> Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway<br> "Of love on a honeymoon<br> "Hitchhiking down the highway, down"<br> Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?<br> Tonsil? Me? No.<br> Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"<br> All right, let it go.<br> "Turn"<br> How about a bite to eat?<br> - That would be lovely.<br> - No thanks, we're not hungry.<br> Young people in love are never hungry.<br> No.<br> "Young people in love<br> "Are very seldom hungry<br> "People in love are very seldom hungry"<br> What were you going to do?<br> Gold dig that guy for a meal?<br> Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.<br> Eat a carrot.<br> No.<br> I'm going in to ask him.<br> You do and I'll break your neck.<br> Come on, let's get out of here.<br> Stretch our legs.<br> I'm sorry...<br> That's all right.<br> Hey! Come here!<br> You've got my suitcase!<br> What happened to you? I was worried.<br> - Get in.<br> - Look at your face! You've got a cut!<br> Well, what happened?<br> A road thief. Picks people up,<br> runs off with their things. What a racket.<br> How'd you get the car?<br> I gave him a black eye for it<br> and had to tie him up to a tree.<br> Can't be much gas left in this thing.<br> Gotta start promoting some.<br> Better take the things out<br> of the pocket of that coat.<br> That'll be good for ten gallons.<br> I haven't changed my mind, Westley.<br> I want you to understand that.<br> I don't like you. Never have. Never will.<br> Now that's clear enough, isn't it?<br> You've made it evident<br> by your threats of annulment.<br> It hasn't worried me for a minute.<br> Ellie and I got married<br> because we love each other.<br> She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,<br> there's going to be no annulment.<br> I see. You've got hold of a good thing<br> and you're going to hang on to it?<br> All right, you win.<br> I'll just have to get used to you.<br> I admit, I'm licked.<br> But it's only because I'm worried.<br> If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.<br> I could have helped if it hadn't been<br> for you. I've been watched so closely...<br> I know. Well, you can help now.<br> I've got a room full of reporters in there.<br> Now, I want you to make a statement.<br> Say that we've talked things over<br> and come to an understanding.<br> And that if she returns<br> I won't interfere with your marriage.<br> - All right?<br> - Yeah, that's quite all right.<br> Okay.<br> I hope you and your wife<br> spend a pleasant week with us.<br> So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.<br> Goodnight.<br> - All right, brat.<br> - Any luck?<br> Yeah. He finally agreed to let us<br> have a cabin.<br> What about the money?<br> I talked him out of that idea.<br> He thinks we're staying a week.<br> - I must think something up before morning.<br> - That's swell.<br> Yeah? I'm glad you think so.<br> If you ask me, I think it's foolish.<br> I told you there's no use in staying here.<br> We can make New York in three hours.<br> I thought you were in a hurry to get back.<br> Whoever heard of getting in<br> at 3:00 in the morning?<br> Everybody will be asleep.<br> Okay. Cottage no. 6.<br> There you go, trusting people again.<br> How many times did I tell you...<br> But he looked like a nice,<br> upright young fellow, Ma.<br> We're on the last lap.<br> Tomorrow morning,<br> you'll be in the arms of your husband.<br> Yeah.<br> You'll have a great story, won't you?<br> Yeah. Swell.<br> Thanks.<br> We certainly outsmarted your father.<br> I guess you ought to be happy.<br> Am I going to see you in New York?<br> Nope.<br> Why not?<br> I don't make it a policy<br> to run around with married women.<br> There's no harm in your coming to see us.<br> Not interested.<br> Won't I ever see you again?<br> What for? I've served my purpose!<br> I brought you back to King Westley.<br> That's what you wanted, wasn't it?<br> Have you ever been in love, Peter?<br> Me?<br> Yes.<br> Haven't you ever thought about it at all?<br> It seems to me you could make<br> some girl wonderfully happy.<br> Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?<br> If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.<br> Where are you gonna find her?<br> Somebody that's real.<br> Somebody that's alive.<br> They don't come that way anymore.<br> Have I ever thought about it?<br> I've even been sucker<br> enough to make plans.<br> I saw an island in the Pacific once.<br> Never been able to forget it.<br> That's where I'd like to take her.<br> She'd have to be the sort of a girl...<br> ...who'd jump in the surf with me<br> and love it as much as I did.<br> Nights when you,<br> the moon and the water all become one.<br> You feel you're part<br> of something big and marvellous.<br> That's the only place to live.<br> The stars are so close overhead you feel<br> you could reach up and stir them around.<br> I've been thinking about it.<br> Boy, if I could ever find a girl<br> who was hungry for those things.<br> Take me with you, Peter.<br> Take me to your island.<br> I want to do all those things<br> you talked about.<br> You better go back to your bed.<br> I love you. Nothing else matters.<br> But we can run away.<br> Everything will take care of itself.<br> Please, Peter...<br> ...I can't let you out of my life now.<br> I couldn't live without you.<br> You'd better go back to your bed.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Did you mean that? Would you really go?<br> All I'm asking is enough gas<br> to get me to New York.<br> That bag's worth $25.<br> I got a bag. I got one for Christmas...<br> Here's what I'll do.<br> I'll come back in the morning...<br> ...and buy it back from you with a $10 profit.<br> - What do you say?<br> - I ain't got a hat.<br> - What?<br> - I ain't got a hat.<br> Well, you got one now.<br> Come on, fill her up.<br> Where you been all this time?<br> Everybody's been asking about you.<br> Get me one drink.<br> Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.<br> Sure, boss.<br> Hello, Agnes.<br> - Don't.

Get out of here before...<br> Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.<br> I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.<br> I'm in a jam.<br> What's the $1,000 for?<br> To tear down the walls of Jericho.<br> Never mind. If I told you that...<br> ...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?<br> - She'll marry somebody else.<br> - You're drunk.<br> Would such a story<br> be worth $1,000 to you?<br> - If it was on the level.<br> - I got it, Joe.<br> - Who's the guy she's gonna marry?<br> - I am.<br> - You?<br> - Yes.<br> Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.<br> Don't annoy me anymore.<br> For heaven sakes!<br> Stop being an editor for a minute.<br> We know each other.<br> You ought to know when I'm serious.<br> This is on the level.<br> I met her on a bus from Miami.<br> I've been with her every minute.<br> I'm in love with her.<br> You gotta get me this money now, quick.<br> Minutes count.<br> She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.<br> I gotta get right back.<br> She doesn't even know I'm gone.<br> A guy can't propose to a gal<br> without a cent in the world, can he?<br> What a story.

They're gone.<br> Looks like it, don't it? What's this?<br> Ma! Here's the woman.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Where's your husband?<br> - Husband?<br> - Yes, if he is your husband.<br> - Isn't he here?<br> - No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.<br> You got any money?<br> - No.<br> - Then you'll have to git!<br> Yeah. You'll have to git.<br> Please, may I use your phone?<br> I've got to call New York.<br> You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.<br> Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter<br> mile down the road. They'll fix you up.<br> And listen, next time you better not come<br> back here. I run a respectable place.<br> - Thanks, you saved my life.<br> - Okay. So long kid and good luck.<br> Goodbye. You're beautiful.<br> All women are beautiful.<br> For my dough, he's still the best<br> newspaper man in the business.<br> Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.<br> Hold up the morning edition.<br> Break down the front page.<br> We'll have a new layout.<br> Send in a couple of rewrite men.<br> And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.<br> I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.<br> Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.<br> Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up<br> all the pictures on that Andrews kid.<br> And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.<br> I want a cartoon and I want it quick.<br> Westley's in it.<br> He's waiting at the church...<br> ...with tears on his face.<br> The bride didn't show up.<br> Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.<br> Everything exaggerated.<br> Snap into it. What is it?<br> Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.<br> I'm not. She phoned her father<br> from an auto camp asking him to come.<br> He's getting a police escort<br> and Westley's going along.<br> Yes, she's been travelling by bus.<br> When she found out her father<br> and Westley made up, she phoned.<br> Okay, grab a car and stay with them.<br> Get Hank again.<br> Agnes, get me a doctor,<br> I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.<br> Hank, forget what I told you.<br> I'm having a nightmare.<br> Agnes, you call the police department.<br> Tell them to find Peter Warne.<br> Send out a general alarm.<br> I want that dirty crook pinched.<br> You want us?<br> Change the front page!<br> Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.<br> She's going home. She found<br> out Dad withdrew his objections.<br> She gave herself up.<br> Spread it all over the place!<br> Play it up big! Major league!<br> "Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.<br> Okay.<br> Come on, baby.<br> We gotta get there before she wakes up.<br> Can't you drive any faster?<br> "Young people in love are never hungry"<br> Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.<br> Come on, baby.<br> They can't make a sucker out of us.<br> All right, come on.<br> Step back. Give them room.<br> Come on, step back.<br> How about a picture for the paper,<br> Mr. Andrews?<br> Wait till she gets home.<br> Later, boys. Later.<br> "He floats through the air<br> with the greatest of ease<br> "The daring young man<br> on the flying trapeze"<br> Get that thing out of the way!<br> Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.<br> Hey, you darn fool!<br> Ellen Andrews is going to marry<br> that Westley guy again.<br> Gordon's out back some place.<br> When he comes in, give him this.<br> Tell him I was just kidding.<br> - You can't get a thing done around here.<br> - Peter was just in.<br> - What?<br> - He left this money.<br> - He said he was just kidding.<br> - Where is he?<br> - There he goes.<br> - Hey, Pete!<br> Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.<br> I thought I'd have some fun with you.<br> Yeah, sure you had me going<br> for a little while, too.<br> - It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.<br> - No, great.<br> But that's the way things go.<br> You think you've got a great yarn...<br> ...and then something comes along and<br> messes up the finish. And there you are.<br> Yeah. Where am I?<br> When you sober up, come in and talk to me.<br> Thanks.<br> Ellie?<br> Hello, Dad.<br> I knocked several times.<br> I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.<br> Everything's set.<br> Creating quite a furore, too.<br> Great stunt King is going to pull.<br> Stunt?<br> Yeah, he's landing on the lawn<br> in an autogyro.<br> Yes, I heard.<br> Personally, I think it's silly, too.<br> You look lovely, child.<br> Are you pleased with the gown?<br> Ellie?<br> The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?<br> What's the matter, child?<br> What's wrong?<br> Nothing.<br> You haven't changed your mind<br> about King have you?<br> No.<br> Because if you have, it isn't too late.<br> You know how I feel about him.<br> Well, you gave me such a scare<br> when I couldn't find you.<br> You know,<br> the old pump isn't what it used to be.<br> I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you<br> for anything in the world. You know that.<br> What's the matter, child?<br> Aren't you happy?<br> I thought so.<br> I knew there was something on your mind.<br> There, now.<br> What's the matter?<br> You haven't fallen in love<br> with someone else, have you?<br> Have you?<br> I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby.<br> This must be serious.<br> Where'd you meet him?<br> On the road.<br> Now don't tell me you've fallen<br> in love with a bus driver?<br> Oh, no.<br> Who is he?<br> I don't know very much about him.<br> Except that I love him.<br> If it's as serious as all that,<br> we'll move heaven and earth to...<br> No, it's no use. He despises me.<br> Come now.<br> Yes, he does.<br> He despises everything about me.<br> He says that I'm spoiled and selfish<br> and pampered and thoroughly insincere.<br> Ridiculous.<br> He doesn't think so much of you, either.<br> Well, l...<br> And he blames you for everything<br> that's wrong with me.<br> He says you raised me stupidly.<br> And now that's a fine man to fall in love with.<br> He's marvellous.<br> What are we going to do about it?<br> Where is he?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I'd like to have a talk with him.<br> It wouldn't do any good.<br> I practically threw myself at him.<br> Under the circumstances, don't you think<br> we'd better call this thing off?<br> No, I'll go through with it.<br> But that's silly.<br> Seeing the way you feel about him.<br> No, it doesn't matter.<br> I don't want to stir up any more trouble.<br> I've done it all my life.<br> I've made your life miserable.<br> And mine, too.<br> I'm tired, father. I'm tired<br> of running around in circles.<br> He's right, that's what I've been doing<br> ever since I can remember.<br> I've got to settle down.<br> It doesn't matter how, where, or with whom.<br> You've changed, Ellie.<br> I can't walk out on King now.<br> It would make us all look so ridiculous.<br> Anyway, what difference does it make?<br> I'll never see Peter again.<br> Is that his name?<br> Peter Warne.<br> Peter Warne.<br> Why, do you know him?<br> Why, no.<br> Father, you haven't heard from him, have you?<br> - Don't be silly, of course.<br> - Please, what's that?<br> I guess that was his only interest in me,<br> wasn't it?<br> - The reward.<br> - I'm sorry you read it.<br> - Are you going to see him?<br> - I suppose so.<br> Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.<br> He did an excellent job.<br> He kept me thoroughly entertained.<br> It's worth every penny he gets.<br> Thank you, Mary.<br> That's just what I needed.<br> Mr. Westley's on his way up.<br> Fine, have him come in.<br> I'll be going.<br> If it isn't the bridegroom himself.<br> You're just in time, King.<br> How are you, Ellie?<br> You happy?<br> Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?<br> Here we are, let's drink.<br> It's up to you now.<br> I want our life to be full of excitement.<br> We'll never let up, will we?<br> Never a dull moment.<br> We'll get on a merry-go-round<br> and never get off.<br> - Promise you'll never let me get off.<br> - Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.<br> Yeah. Who?<br> Why can't I see you at your office?<br> I'm leaving for Washington tonight.<br> I may be gone several weeks.<br> I thought, perhaps,<br> you'd like to get this thing settled.<br> Yeah. But I don't like the idea<br> of butting in on your jamboree.<br> Between you and me,<br> those things give me a stiff pain.<br> You don't have to see anybody.<br> You can come directly to my study.<br> No. Why do I wanna...<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Maybe I will come over. Yeah.<br> I'd like to get a load of<br> that three ring circus you're pulling.<br> I wanna see what love looks like<br> when it's triumphant.<br> I haven't had a good laugh in a week.<br> Mr. Warne?<br> Yeah.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thanks.<br> I was surprised to get your note.<br> My daughter hadn't told me anything...<br> ...about you. About your helping her.<br> That's typical of your daughter.<br> Takes those things for granted.<br> Why did she think I lugged her all the<br> way from Miami, for the love of it?<br> She thinks you're entitled<br> to anything you can get.<br> Oh, she does, eh? Now, isn't that<br> sweet of her? You don't, I suppose.<br> Well, I don't know. I'll have to see<br> on what you base your claim.<br> I presume you feel justified.<br> If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.<br> I got it all itemised.<br> "Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.<br> "Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.00.<br> "Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.<br> "All of the above items had<br> to be sold to buy gasoline."<br> And I sold some shorts and socks, too.<br> I'm throwing those in.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?<br> Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000, maybe more.<br> Now, let me get this straight. You want<br> $39.60 in addition to the $10,000?<br> What $10,000?<br> The reward.<br> Who said anything about a reward?<br> I'm afraid I'm a little<br> bit confused. I assumed...<br> All I want is $39.60. If you give<br> me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.<br> It gives me the jitters.<br> - You're a peculiar chap.<br> - We'll go into that some other time.<br> The average man would go after the reward.<br> All You seem to be...<br> Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you?<br> It's a matter of principle.<br> You probably wouldn't understand.<br> When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,<br> I don't like paying for the privilege.<br> Were you taken for a buggy ride?<br> Yes. With all the trimmings.<br> So how about the check, do I get it?<br> - Certainly.<br> - Thanks.<br> Here you are.<br> Thank you.<br> Do you mind if I ask you a question, frankly?<br> Do you love my daughter?<br> Any guy in love with your<br> daughter should be examined.<br> Now that's an evasion.<br> She picked herself a perfect running mate,<br> King Westley. The pill of the century.<br> She needs a guy that'd sock her once<br> a day whether it's coming to her or not.<br> If you were wiser,<br> you'd have done it yourself long ago.<br> Do you love her?<br> A normal man couldn't live<br> with her without going nutty.<br> She's my idea of nothing.<br> I asked you a simple question!<br> Do you love her?<br> Yes! Now don't hold that against me!<br> I'm a little screwy myself!<br> Here's to the merry-go-round.<br> Perfect. Now you look natural.<br> - I hope you got your money.<br> - You bet I did.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thanks. Same to you.<br> Stay around and watch the fun.<br> You'll enjoy it immensely.<br> I would, but I've got a weak stomach.<br> - I just had a long talk with him.<br> - I'm not interested.<br> Now just a minute, Ellie.<br> I don't want to hear another word about him.<br> Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.<br> Here they come, boys. Turn them over.<br> You're a sucker to go through with this.<br> That guy, Warne, is okay.<br> He didn't want the reward.<br> All he asked for was $39.60.<br> It's what he spent on you.<br> Said it was a matter of principle.<br> You took him for a ride.<br> He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.<br> You don't want to be married<br> to a mug like Westley.<br> I can buy him off for a pot of gold.<br> And you can make an old man happy.<br> And you won't do so bad for yourself.<br> If you change your mind,<br> your car's waiting at the back gate.<br> Dearly beloved, we are gathered<br> together here in the sight of God...<br> ...and in the face of this company,<br> to join together this man and this woman...<br> ...in holy matrimony. If any man can show<br> just cause why they may not lawfully...<br> ...be joined together, let him now speak<br> or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.<br> King, will thou have this woman to thy<br> wedded wife so long as you both shall live?<br> I will.<br> Ellen, will thou have this man<br> to thy wedded husband...<br> ...so long as you both shall live?<br> Ellen!<br> Ellie!<br> What happened?<br> I haven't the slightest idea.<br> Don't want to talk to you.<br> Don't want to talk to anybody.<br> Don't want to see anybody.<br> But it's King Westley on the phone.<br> Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.<br> I've sent you a check for $100,000.<br> That's the smartest thing you ever did,<br> Westley, not to contest that annulment.<br> That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.<br> I'm not complaining.<br> Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.<br> Don't fall out of any windows!<br> There's another wire from Peter.<br> They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.<br> "What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke.<br> "The walls of Jericho are toppling."<br> Send him a telegram right away.<br> Just say, "Let them topple."<br> - Funny couple, ain't they?<br> - Yeah.<br> If you ask me,<br> I don't believe they're married.<br> They're married, all right.<br> I just seen the license.<br> They made me get them a rope<br> and a blanket, on a night like this.<br> What do you reckon that's for?<br> Blamed if I know.<br> I just brung 'em a trumpet.<br> A trumpet?<br> Yeah one of them toy things.<br> They sent me to the store to get it.<br> What in the world do they want a trumpet for?<br> Don't know.<br>
