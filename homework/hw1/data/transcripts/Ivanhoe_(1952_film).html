                        In the 12th century, at the close of<br> the Third Crusade to free the Holy Land...<br> ... a Saxon knight,<br> called Wilfred of Ivanhoe...<br> ... undertook a private crusade of his own.<br> England's warrior king,<br> Richard the Lion-Hearted...<br> ... had disappeared during his<br> homeward march, vanishing without trace.<br> His disappearance dealt a cruel blow<br> to his unhappy country...<br> ... already in turmoil from the bitter conflict<br> between Saxon and Norman.<br> And in time, most of his subjects<br> came to mourn him as dead.<br> But Ivanhoe's faith<br> that his king still lived...<br> ... took him on an endless quest<br> from castle to castle...<br> ... until, at last, he came to Austria.<br> Who are you?<br> What do you want of me?<br> Tell me what is written here.<br> I read no Austrian.<br> Happily, I read English.<br> Read it to me happily, then.<br> "To the people of England...<br> ...I am here held captive<br> by Leopold of Austria.<br> My brother, Prince John,<br> has knowledge of it...<br> ...yet he has denied me ransom,<br> I fear he does conspire<br> with certain Norman knights...<br> ...to seize my throne.<br> People of England, speed my deliverance.<br> Your kingdom is at stake."<br> - It is signed...<br> - I know the hand that signed it.<br> But the eyes that saw it shall forget<br> that name and all they read.<br> Or this knife will pluck them out<br> and cast them to the crows.<br> Do you remember what you saw?<br> I have forgotten every syllable.<br> "Prince John...<br> ...and certain Norman knights."<br> "Certain Norman knights."<br> These glades go on forever.<br> I hope we find shelter before nightfall,<br> Bois-Guilbert.<br> What do you fear, De Bracy,<br> Saxon hobgoblins?<br> No, a Saxon arrow<br> in the small of my back.<br> I wager there's a cutthroat<br> behind every tree trunk.<br> Aye. And soon,<br> they'll be hanging from them.<br> Unless we are.<br> God save you, knight.<br> And God save you. We ride<br> to Ashby. Which crossroad do we take?<br> The right will take you to Ashby.<br> - Shall we get there by nightfall?<br> - By nightfall tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow? Can you show us the way<br> to a roof for the night?<br> I know of a roof nearby,<br> but perhaps you would scorn it.<br> Why? Is it humble?<br> No, sire. It is Saxon.<br> I'd sooner bivouac by the road.<br> - 'Tis a fine night.<br> - To be butchered in one's sleep.<br> - Would you sooner walk into a Saxon trap?<br> - What is this house you speak of?<br> Rotherwood, the keep of Cedric the Saxon.<br> I believe I know this Cedric the Saxon.<br> Has he a ward, a woman of great beauty?<br> The Saxon princess, Lady Rowena,<br> is his ward.<br> Aye, Rowena. 'Tis the same Cedric.<br> He loves us not, but we would<br> sleep safe beneath his roof.<br> - You know the way?<br> - Well enough to lead.<br> Then lead us, but one false step<br> and you'll sing a different song.<br> I have a song to fit every occasion.<br> - He means he'll lop your head off, minstrel.<br> - Yes, sire, I knew what he meant.<br> - Now, Locksley, while they're in range.<br> - Peace, hothead. Would you slay lvanhoe?<br> - Ivanhoe died in the Holy Land.<br> - The troubadour is lvanhoe.<br> He takes those Normans to his father's.<br> Ivanhoe defied his father when he went<br> to the war. Cedric cast him off.<br> He would never go back,<br> unless he's turned traitor to the Saxons.<br> Put down your bows.<br> I'll know why he takes those Normans<br> to his father before I'll believe ill...<br> ...of Sir lvanhoe or Cedric.<br> And so shall you, you rattle-pate.<br> By your leave, milord, two knights<br> do request food and lodging.<br> They are Normans,<br> lately returned from the Holy Land.<br> If they break no laws of courtesy as guests,<br> I'll break none as host.<br> Bid them enter and depart in peace,<br> or else depart in pieces.<br> Elgitha, tell the lady Rowena I do not<br> desire her presence here tonight.<br> But she is pining for news<br> from the Holy Land.<br> When she hears they are Normans,<br> she'll want none of their news.<br> Tell her to keep to her chambers<br> till we're quit of them tomorrow.<br> Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert<br> and Sir Hugh De Bracy, milord.<br> We come in peace, Sir Cedric.<br> In peace, I greet you.<br> We come, also, as friends.<br> I greet no one in friendship, save those<br> who share the royal Saxon blood.<br> Homely fare is before you.<br> Eat your fill of it.<br> Take me to the Lady Rowena.<br> Who is there?<br> A sort of fool, milady.<br> Come in, Wamba.<br> Make me laugh a little.<br> Tonight, milady, I do not play the fool.<br> I play the wizard.<br> Close your eyes, and I will perform...<br> ...a wonder.<br> How long must I keep my eyes closed?<br> Till you have wished.<br> What shall I wish for?<br> Whom do you hold most dear?<br> You know who that is.<br> Say his name, and he shall come to you.<br> Ivanhoe.<br> - Oh, I knew, I knew.<br> - Knew what, Rowena?<br> I knew that you were safe and that<br> you were alive and that you loved me still.<br> I used to reach out my hands at night<br> when I couldn't sleep...<br> ...and there was only darkness<br> all around me.<br> And I'd feel your fingertips touch mine...<br> ...and I knew you were still alive,<br> and I was comforted.<br> There was never a day nor an hour<br> when your hand was not in mine.<br> Why are you crying?<br> I'm... I'm too happy to laugh.<br> - I've never known such happiness.<br> - Nor have I, ever.<br> It's as if you'd never been away,<br> as if I'd never suffered any loneliness...<br> ...except in a dream that I awoke from<br> when you kissed me.<br> This was not a dream, though.<br> The scars are almost gone.<br> Do you remember how afraid you were?<br> Not when you cut my wrist,<br> only when you cut your own.<br> And I know I didn't show it.<br> You were trembling as you knelt beside me<br> when we made our vow to God.<br> While my blood mingled with yours.<br> Does my father hate me still?<br> No one is allowed to speak your name.<br> Then I must make my peace with him<br> as swiftly as I can.<br> - Ivanhoe, what trouble are you in?<br> - None yet.<br> But Richard is not dead.<br> He's held for ransom in Austria...<br> ...and John would keep him there.<br> I've snared two Norman hawks below.<br> I cannot hood them single-handed.<br> I need aid.<br> - What help can I be?<br> - Come and draw them out.<br> These are John's friends.<br> If my father will help me...<br> ...I can trick them into telling<br> what they know.<br> And if he will not help you?<br> Then, indeed, I have no father.<br> Where's Wamba? Where's my fool?<br> I want to be amused.<br> And you'll find it hard enough to do.<br> - I've been unavoidably delayed, milord.<br> - Delayed? How so?<br> When I heard Normans<br> were approaching...<br> ...I ran to lock up my wife.<br> But she'd also heard<br> they were approaching...<br> ...and locked me up instead.<br> A fool's wife is safe, milord.<br> We are bound for combat against your<br> Saxon knights at Ashby, three days hence.<br> - Not for any Saxon lady's chamber.<br> - And how will you spend...<br> ...your last three days on earth?<br> It will not be my friend and I who will die.<br> Will you be there to see the Saxons fall?<br> Milord, there is a stranger at your gate<br> who begs shelter.<br> He is a Jew who calls himself Isaac of York.<br> I share no roof with an infidel.<br> Why not, sir knight? For every Jew<br> you show me who's not a Christian...<br> ...l'll show you a Christian<br> who's not a Christian.<br> Why should my guests be subject<br> to your prejudices...<br> ...when they have not been subject to<br> my own? Bid this traveler enter in peace.<br> I come in peace, milord.<br> May God reward your mercy.<br> In peace, I greet you.<br> Make a place for him at the table,<br> and give him food and drink.<br> If hearsay does not lie, you have a ward<br> of surpassing beauty, milord.<br> Why is the hall dimmed by the absence<br> of the brightest flame in Saxon England?<br> Because, sir knight, we Saxons have learned<br> to hide our light under a bushel.<br> Are we condemned never to pay homage<br> to her?<br> No Saxon princess seeks homage from<br> the men who took her lands by conquest...<br> ...threw down her ancient laws<br> and put her subjects to the sword.<br> Those well-chewed scraps of bile<br> were better thrown to the dogs...<br> ...than to Normans.<br> While such as you were sulking<br> here at home...<br> ...we held the infidel at bay<br> in England's name...<br> ...and fell before his fury.<br> If our blood is red enough<br> to bleed for England...<br> ...it's red enough to pay homage<br> to any woman:<br> Saxon, Norman, Dane or Celt.<br> Then pay me your homage, sir...<br> ...and let me be the judge of its gallantry.<br> We pay you homage, milady.<br> But it must be silent homage,<br> for words would fail it...<br> ...just as they have failed my friend,<br> and all but failed me.<br> I thank you, sir knight.<br> There are questions<br> that I would ask of you...<br> ...as soon as your tongue is loose again.<br> At your command, milady.<br> What is the news from the Holy Land?<br> Alas, milady, I can add little<br> to what you must already know.<br> The war has ended<br> in a truceless truce once more...<br> ...and Richard vanished upon the wind<br> that once made up the better part of him.<br> Richard should've stayed at home<br> and kept England...<br> ...and left Jerusalem to be lost<br> by knights like you...<br> ...who lost it anyway.<br> Are you for Richard, milord, or for John?<br> Richard and John had the same mother<br> One was a Norman<br> So, what was the other?<br> Both were Norman, true.<br> But Richard, with all his faults,<br> was for England.<br> And John?<br> John is for John.<br> Then you're against John?<br> That's another Norman question.<br> Shall I answer it for you, milord?<br> No, I would have my questions<br> answered first. Sir knight...<br> ...I believe there were tournaments<br> between Saxon and Norman knights...<br> ...to prove which was more valiant.<br> - Aye, milady, in the Holy Land.<br> The Saxons were at last taught<br> to bow to their betters.<br> And yet, I hear the Saxons<br> won the tournaments.<br> How does a Saxon lady come to know<br> so much of such distant matters?<br> Only from the tales I hear, sir knight.<br> And I was told that<br> in the tournament at Acre...<br> ...Richard of England led five<br> of his Saxon knights into combat...<br> ...and vanquished all<br> who challenged them.<br> The one who fell was named De Bracy.<br> And another, Bois-Guilbert.<br> True, milady. I blush, but I admit it.<br> I can still feel the dust in my mouth.<br> Is it out of your teeth yet, Guilbert?<br> A broken saddle girth caused my fall,<br> not the bumpkin of a knight I tilted.<br> And who was this bumpkin of a knight?<br> He named himself Wilfred of lvanhoe.<br> - Ivanhoe?<br> - Aye, milady.<br> A friend of Richard's<br> who vanished as suddenly as his king.<br> What manner of knight<br> was he to look upon?<br> I never saw his face.<br> Few men did.<br> But he wore a dragon charge<br> upon his shield.<br> I shall know him by that,<br> if we ever meet again.<br> - And why did he vanish, sire?<br> - Because he was a coward.<br> Coward?<br> Aye, a coward who fled when there<br> was no Richard to hide behind...<br> ...before I could challenge him<br> to meet me.<br> Then I give you the challenge that lvanhoe<br> would give to you were he here, sir knight.<br> And I bid you drink to his honor<br> as a fellow knight.<br> And you, milord.<br> Will you drink to his honor too?<br> To lvanhoe.<br> - To lvanhoe.<br> - To lvanhoe.<br> Why this Saxon passion<br> for a stranger, milady?<br> Lvanhoe was not always a stranger<br> to these halls.<br> He's a stranger now.<br> He was my son.<br> Was?<br> Have I been cheated?<br> You mean he's dead?<br> He is to me.<br> I have come at my foster child's request.<br> Nothing else would've brought me.<br> What do you want of me?<br> - Your hand first, sire.<br> - I do not give it.<br> Milord, he is still your son.<br> What do you want of me?<br> Be brief, for I want none of you.<br> I will be brief, then.<br> I have found the king.<br> - The king is dead.<br> - He is alive...<br> ...held by Leopold of Austria.<br> It's all here in his hand.<br> Read it yourself.<br> John has left him in chains<br> so he can steal his throne.<br> As those two Norman knights in your castle<br> could testify, if you put them to the sword.<br> Is it Richard's hand?<br> Perhaps. Written before they killed him.<br> I heard his voice, I tell you.<br> The king is alive.<br> What is the ransom?<br> - There's not that sum in England.<br> - You could pay your share of it.<br> For what, to buy back Richard's corpse?<br> I'll use what money I have left to slay<br> the living Normans, not dig up the dead.<br> - You'll leave your king to rot, then?<br> - I'll leave him to mad, wild fools like you...<br> ...who can do neither harm nor good.<br> Then you force me to choose<br> between my father and my king.<br> Choose? Choose between whom?<br> You have no king, and I have no son.<br> I bid you take no part in this<br> nor look upon his face again.<br> Begone from here within the hour.<br> What will you do now?<br> Follow Bois-Guilbert to Ashby<br> and meet him in the lists.<br> Be cautious, lvanhoe.<br> Don't be afraid, Rowena.<br> Richard will be king again, and we shall be<br> there to see the crown set upon his head.<br> Look for me at the tournament<br> and pray for me.<br> - Farewell.<br> - Farewell, and God protect you.<br> Sir lvanhoe, I heard an old bear<br> and a young bear growling.<br> Which one would leave the den?<br> The young bear, Wamba.<br> - Alone?<br> - Alone.<br> No, sire. I will go with you.<br> My servant's collar and all.<br> Is your heart not here<br> with the Lady Rowena?<br> No, sire. My heart is in there, with yours.<br> Then henceforth,<br> you shall be my squire, Wamba.<br> Squire? Squire Wamba?<br> Wamba the squire. Oh, if it weren't for this,<br> I'd be a gentleman.<br> We'll have that collar off as soon as<br> we're away from here.<br> What...?<br> Help! Help!<br> Bind them together, Wamba.<br> How badly are you hurt?<br> Only a little.<br> My home, Sheffield town...<br> ...I want to go back there at once.<br> - Alone at night? You'd perish.<br> Even so, I must go back to Sheffield.<br> Then I shall take you there.<br> I've trussed them up,<br> like capons.<br> Bring our horses and meet me<br> in the courtyard.<br> - But, Sir lvanhoe, I have no horse.<br> - Then steal one.<br> A gentleman at last and my first task<br> is to steal a horse.<br> Take quarters at the sign of the longbow.<br> I'll join you.<br> - Master. Master.<br> - Enough, enough.<br> All's well with me. Let us in.<br> - Are you recovered?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> And much beholden to you<br> for your kindness, sire.<br> Yet there is one question I would ask.<br> - What is it?<br> - I heard the jester call you "lvanhoe."<br> But lvanhoe is Cedric's son,<br> and Cedric called him dead.<br> Who are you, then?<br> I am King Richard's envoy.<br> Does that make us friends or foes?<br> It does not make you my foe, sire...<br> ...but then, I am allowed no king.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because I am allowed no country.<br> I am deeply in your debt, sire.<br> Tell me how I can repay you.<br> I seek 150,000 marks of silver...<br> ...the price of Richard's ransom<br> from Leopold of Austria.<br> Glance around you, sire.<br> What you see is all we've saved...<br> ...from every home we tried to make.<br> A toy or two from every land<br> that cast us out.<br> I am not a rich man, Sir lvanhoe.<br> No, but you are the patriarch<br> of your tribe.<br> Tell your people Richard must be ransomed.<br> They will find the wealth.<br> I see you love Richard, sire...<br> ...but he was no friend to my people.<br> Our synagogues were looted<br> to send him on his crusades.<br> Do you prefer the persecution<br> of his brother, John?<br> There is little to choose between Black John<br> and Richard, yea and nay, if you are a Jew.<br> Then I pledge you this, Isaac.<br> You're a race without a home or a country.<br> Deliver Richard, and he will deliver<br> your people from persecution.<br> My friend, you ask for more<br> than we can give.<br> - And you offer more than Richard can give.<br> - Do you doubt my word?<br> Write down whatever terms you want.<br> I shall sign them in King Richard's name.<br> We shall need no pledge on paper,<br> you and I.<br> Let Richard promise this instead.<br> Let him promise justice to each man...<br> ...whether he be Saxon<br> or Norman or Jew...<br> ...for justice belongs to all men...<br> ...or it belongs to none.<br> But that is a Christian teaching.<br> Strange as it may be, sire,<br> we are taught it too.<br> What you ask shall be done.<br> So be it, then. Whatever money<br> you cannot find among your own people...<br> ...I shall try to find it for you.<br> Does that fulfill our pact?<br> Not quite.<br> This combat at arms at Ashby<br> is a weather vane...<br> ...to test the strength of John.<br> If his knights were to sweep the field,<br> how would it go with Richard's cause?<br> Badly, sire. Money takes fright<br> when might conquers right.<br> My worldly goods are what I stand in.<br> I have no armor and no warhorse.<br> But I must ride against John's knights<br> at Ashby, or they will win.<br> A horse and gear would borrow<br> from the ransom.<br> Then I'll seek them elsewhere.<br> You'll find me at the sign<br> of the longbow.<br> Here is my hand,<br> in token of my pledge to you.<br> Why do you look at me thus, Isaac?<br> This is the first time I touch a Saxon hand<br> in friendship, Sir lvanhoe.<br> It is Richard's hand you touch.<br> Now for thy collar, good squire.<br> Kneel down.<br> A cow jumped the moon<br> But a fool, he jumps higher<br> From Wamba the serf<br> To Wamba the squire<br> Oh, strike, Sir lvanhoe,<br> while I still have me courage.<br> Then off come your shackles.<br> Oh, no. Make sure it's the shackles,<br> not my head.<br> There.<br> May your next collar be no heavier<br> than a pretty woman's arms.<br> Oh, that, sire, is a collar<br> that I shall change every day.<br> When they first put this on me, sire,<br> I was 11 years old.<br> My father died with his<br> still around his neck.<br> I feel very strange.<br> Strange? To be free?<br> Yes, and I could wish that the whole<br> of England could feel as strange as I do.<br> And so they shall,<br> as soon as Richard's king again.<br> Now, good squire, get you to sleep.<br> Squire.<br> Stand and declare yourself.<br> Now, milady, what is your purpose here?<br> I was told to deliver this to your lodgings.<br> At this hour? By the window?<br> Who sent you?<br> This is no time to lose your tongue.<br> Who sent you?<br> I come from the household<br> of Isaac of York.<br> Open the box.<br> - What are these for?<br> - For you.<br> If these are Isaac's, he would have given<br> them to me before I left.<br> They are not his to give. They were handed<br> down to my mistress by her mother.<br> Who is your mistress?<br> Rebecca, the daughter of Isaac.<br> She bade me tell you that these<br> are for your armor and your horse...<br> ...so that you may ride at Ashby.<br> Is this with<br> your mother's knowledge, Rebecca?<br> My mother was killed in Spain<br> two years ago.<br> That is why my father<br> brought me to England.<br> If I should fall at Ashby, horse and armor are<br> forfeit to the victor. These would all be lost.<br> You will not fall.<br> But if I should?<br> Then England would fall too.<br> Do you love England so much?<br> Does a prisoner love his prison?<br> - Then why do you give me your jewels?<br> - In return for my father's life.<br> - Your father has rewarded me already.<br> - Then I reward you again.<br> If you change your mind, in fear, to ride<br> at Ashby, give these back to me.<br> Otherwise, use them to win the day.<br> I shall use them.<br> That is all I came to hear.<br> May I have your leave to go?<br> Not alone.<br> Squire? Wamba!<br> Squire Wamba? That's me. Coming, sire.<br> - My squire will attend you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Give this lady escort<br> to the house of Isaac.<br> Right willingly, sire.<br> I wish you well, sir knight. Farewell.<br> Farewell?<br> Will you not be there at Ashby,<br> when it is you who have put me in the lists?<br> Do not look for me at Ashby, sire.<br> Why not?<br> Because it is not wise for me to go...<br> ...and still less wise if you were seen<br> to greet me there.<br> But why?<br> Because I am my father's daughter,<br> sir knight.<br> Why else?<br> Nobly ridden, my lords.<br> I never yet saw better sport.<br> - The day is already ours, Your Highness.<br> - Aye, the Saxons are poor losers, Fitzurse.<br> Look at their faces now.<br> Richard destroyed the flower of the land.<br> And now his brother destroys<br> the seedlings that are left.<br> If only I were a man for one short hour.<br> We'd still need a hundred like you<br> to bring back Saxon glory to this field.<br> I was wrong to let you coax me here,<br> Rebecca. Only grief can come of it.<br> What's this, another challenger?<br> I thought we'd picked them clean.<br> Your name, sir knight, or your degree?<br> My name, I withhold. My allegiance<br> is to Richard, King of England.<br> Are you Norman or Saxon?<br> I am Saxon.<br> Choose your adversary...<br> ...by stroke of lance upon his shield.<br> Black from hoof to plume,<br> the ill-omened knave.<br> He'll soon be bright with blood,<br> Your Highness.<br> The madman. He defies all five!<br> Bash him quickly, Malvoisin.<br> By all that's wonderful, I almost see myself<br> grown young again, Rowena.<br> He reminds me much<br> of a certain pupil of mine.<br> I'll bring Malvoisin to his knees for this,<br> the empty-headed jay.<br> By holy St. Dunstan,<br> our champion pays homage to the Jews.<br> No, milord...<br> ...his homage was to beauty,<br> not to faith, I fear.<br> I think I know that knight, Rebecca.<br> But how do you?<br> But did you not bring him to our house?<br> How did he get his armor and his horse?<br> My mother's jewels were mine to give.<br> Did I do wrong?<br> Nay.<br> I approve.<br> But only of the gift.<br> Aye.<br> Hide that face from every man, save me.<br> His taste in women is a glove<br> in every Saxon face.<br> Now let Sir Ralph throw him,<br> and his shame's complete.<br> Front De Boeuf, the field is all yours.<br> I shall follow you to glory.<br> Follow with a basket, then.<br> I'm going to strew the field<br> with Saxon guts and bones.<br> If you could tear your eyes<br> from your light of love, Guilbert...<br> ...this black knight's tricks bear watching.<br> - I have been watching.<br> He swings his shield low, levels at the head,<br> but drops point before shock.<br> I swear I've met these methods<br> once before, but where?<br> Oh, rich. Oh, richly done.<br> Let him do it twice more, and I'll not say<br> a word if his love was a Barbary ape.<br> I would she were.<br> This knight is no stranger.<br> - Only one Saxon could ever fight like that.<br> - Sir lvanhoe?<br> - And you would've had me shoot him down.<br> - Why, it was I who stopped you.<br> May he choke on his beard!<br> He went at his foe like a stupid bull<br> to the slaughter.<br> Now it's De Bracy.<br> He's hurt.<br> Oh, I pray to God he rides no more.<br> To whose god shall a Jew pray<br> for a gentile?<br> To the same God who made them both.<br> Fitzurse, have this upstart<br> brought before me.<br> I intend to mark him well.<br> Marshal!<br> Ride again.<br> It takes more than a lisping Norman<br> to unhorse my son.<br> You have no son.<br> I've heard you say it.<br> Your foe has bloodied you, sir knight.<br> Will you concede defeat?<br> You fight too well to die so mean a death.<br> Will you not throw in your lot<br> with me instead?<br> That would be an even meaner death,<br> Your Grace.<br> Lower your lance.<br> By laws of chivalry,<br> you've earned the right to choose...<br> ...who shall be queen of love and beauty<br> at our sport.<br> It is our pleasure you shall appoint her...<br> ...so that one, at least, shall mourn you<br> when you lie cold beneath your shield.<br> A Saxon queen.<br> Confound the dog!<br> Is there no end to his insults?<br> - Why does he plague me so?<br> - Forget him, Your Highness.<br> His strutting cannot harm you.<br> You're too well-loved.<br> Wake up. The crown is not so firmly on my<br> head that I can let a rebel tilt at it in public.<br> You speak of the dead, Your Highness.<br> - He now faces Bois-Guilbert.<br> - I hope he cleaves him so he splits in two.<br> We know you, sir knight.<br> From this moment on, at any time,<br> at any price, we are your men.<br> My son.<br> Milord, your place is at his side.<br> Go to him and forgive him.<br> Go instead, to see that his wounds are cared<br> for. Then come to tell me how he fares.<br> But never let him know I sent you.<br> He will not let me touch him, milady, but<br> he'll die from loss of blood if we leave him.<br> He shall not be left here,<br> and I shall not let him die.<br> Sir squire, fetch a litter.<br> Ivanhoe.<br> Ivanhoe.<br> I failed you, Rowena...<br> ...as I failed my king.<br> You have won the king's first victory.<br> No.<br> Not until I have defeated Bois-Guilbert.<br> Wamba, go find a physician<br> and bring him here at once!<br> No physician, milady.<br> He's bled enough.<br> Who are you to say what shall be done?<br> I was taught medicine<br> by Miriam of Manassas...<br> ...and I can heal him.<br> Miriam of Manassas? But she was a witch.<br> They burned her at the stake.<br> Yes, milady, as they well may burn me too.<br> But the point of De Bracy's lance...<br> ...is still deep within that wound.<br> If it is probed for here...<br> ...not even you could answer for his life.<br> How can I be sure what you're telling me<br> is the truth?<br> Shall I argue with you while he dies?<br> I can heal him, milady.<br> If you can say the same, take him.<br> If you cannot, stand aside.<br> Stand aside, for you?<br> No, milady.<br> For lvanhoe.<br> How did you come to know him?<br> My father knows him, milady, not I.<br> - Where will you take him?<br> - To my father's house in Sheffield.<br> I leave him in your care.<br> I shall not fail him.<br> May I send his squire for the litter?<br> - Do as the lady bids, Wamba.<br> - Yes, milady.<br> Swear to me his wound will mend.<br> His wound will mend.<br> You love him.<br> Why, I told you,<br> I hardly know him, milady.<br> How shall I know how he fares?<br> I will send word to you<br> by his squire, milady.<br> I will await it.<br> - Well?<br> - He is in good hands, milord.<br> - His wounds, are they slight or heavy?<br> - Heavy, milord.<br> They'll carry him to Sheffield.<br> He will be tended there.<br> We'll go to Sheffield till he's out of danger.<br> See he never hears of it...<br> ...or he'll think I've softened into dotage.<br> Hundebert! The horses!<br> Roast your liver.<br> To the confusion and confounding<br> of that cursed death's-head knight.<br> - Why couldn't you fools kill him on the field?<br> - Because he was no fool.<br> How can a Norman hold the throne<br> of England...<br> ...when his knights go down like chaff...<br> ...beneath an unknown<br> Saxon mountebank?<br> Neither a mountebank nor yet unknown.<br> I rode against that knight at Acre,<br> in the war.<br> Then tell us who he is.<br> The favored henchman of your brother<br> Richard, my liege. Wilfred of lvanhoe.<br> Ivanhoe? Here in England?<br> You told me he was dead!<br> He should be, and he shall be<br> when he and I meet again.<br> I carry his death warrant here<br> against my breast.<br> Then why is he here?<br> Where else but among Saxons<br> would he seek the ransom for his Richard?<br> Do you know this?<br> Nay. I do but trust my nose,<br> sniffing like a badger in a wood.<br> To whom did lvanhoe tip his lance<br> in gallantry today?<br> To a Jewess named Rebecca, daughter<br> of Isaac, the banker of his tribe.<br> What could he want of the Jews<br> except money for the ransom?<br> - Where is he now?<br> - Not far from the money, if I know lvanhoe.<br> I empower you to find and seize him<br> and every man who's tried to help him.<br> - Their women too?<br> - Their women, their servants, their dogs.<br> I want every creature...<br> ...Saxon, Jew or Norman,<br> who's had a hand in aiding Richard.<br> But most urgently, I want lvanhoe...<br> ...no matter what it costs.<br> - You shall have him, my liege.<br> Set about it. De Bracy, go with him.<br> Front De Boeuf, you too.<br> Aye, my liege.<br> So the plum drops ripe<br> into your outstretched hand.<br> Into mine or no one's.<br> I love you.<br> And I must not feel it.<br> And yet I love you, lvanhoe...<br> ...with all the longing in the lonely world.<br> - How is he?<br> - All is well with him, Father.<br> And with you?<br> I've not been blind to the loneliness<br> of your life, my child.<br> The happiness you long for is real,<br> and all men long for it...<br> ...but you will not find it here.<br> This knight's faith forbids him<br> to look upon you as a woman...<br> ...even as yours forbids you to look<br> upon him as a man.<br> Then why does it not also forbid me<br> to feel joy or sorrow?<br> It tries to teach you that as well.<br> Then it has failed.<br> If our teachings are false,<br> they will pass away...<br> ...but until that time,<br> we must abide by them.<br> Perish by them, you mean.<br> My heart is breaking, Father.<br> My heart broke long ago...<br> ...but it serves me still.<br> My daughter brought you back here<br> and tended your wound, Sir lvanhoe.<br> Again, you come to my aid.<br> And you, Isaac.<br> Rest peacefully, sir knight.<br> The ransom is growing<br> even while we speak...<br> ...some here in Sheffield,<br> but most in York.<br> When you can,<br> we will journey there to gather it.<br> We?<br> You've risked enough.<br> Stay here in safety, Rebecca.<br> What place in England is safe<br> until the ransom is paid?<br> And you said you loved not England.<br> - Locksley seeks word with you, sire.<br> - Sir lvanhoe...<br> ...Prince John's jackals are upon you.<br> They know it's you and that Isaac aided.<br> And John's sent Bois-Guilbert<br> to seize you.<br> Will you be safe in York?<br> - Yes, Sir lvanhoe.<br> - Then get you there.<br> - They'll break down every door in Sheffield.<br> - Not every door. Not Cedric's.<br> - Or he'll bring the roof about their ears.<br> - Cedric in Sheffield?<br> Yes, sire, to hear news of you.<br> Take this lady and her father to him.<br> Beg him for protection as far as Rotherwood.<br> I'll join you in York as soon as I can ride<br> again. Guard your charges with your life...<br> ...until they're safe in York.<br> - I will.<br> Go, then, at once.<br> We'll hide you in the forest<br> till your wounds are healed.<br> - No one here.<br> - What did you expect?<br> They had wind of us and flew the trap,<br> your ladybird with them.<br> They'll not have flown far.<br> - I've traced Isaac and his daughter.<br> - Where are they?<br> On the way to Rotherwood<br> under Cedric's protection.<br> - And lvanhoe?<br> - Fled to the forest with Locksley's rebels.<br> Then we take the father first.<br> - Take Cedric and rouse all Saxon England?<br> - John gave me full powers. I'll use them.<br> Once we hold Cedric,<br> we'll smoke out lvanhoe.<br> - Assemble the men. We ride at once.<br> - Aye.<br> Guilbert.<br> - Have you weighed this well?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll risk all on one throw and win.<br> Win what? A Jewess or a hornet's nest?<br> Squire Wamba.<br> Squire Wamba!<br> I'll squire you, you renegade.<br> - I'll collar that neck again or wring it.<br> - Touched, milord.<br> Is that the tone for one gentleman<br> to use to another?<br> Out of my sight before my wrath boils over<br> and I squash you like a plum!<br> I left lvanhoe in your care to nurse<br> until his wound was healed.<br> And now you ride beside me as calmly<br> as I would ride to church.<br> Do you infidels never show your feelings?<br> We are taught not to have them, milady.<br> Will you see lvanhoe in York?<br> I do not know, milady.<br> But you hope to.<br> Yes, I hope to.<br> Does he know we quarreled<br> over him at Ashby?<br> No, milady.<br> Does a Jew feel jealousy?<br> Yes, milady.<br> Then they're not so different<br> from the Saxon, after all.<br> Death to the Norman dogs!<br> God save England!<br> God save Wamba.<br> I bid you right welcome to my keep,<br> Sir Cedric.<br> Your keep. Torquilstone was cursed forever<br> when you put your Norman foot across it.<br> Talk sweeter, Saxon, or I'll put my<br> Norman foot across your neck!<br> A horseman approaching from the south!<br> Milord, it's lvanhoe.<br> - Ivanhoe.<br> - Yes, milord.<br> Coming like a lamb to the butcher.<br> So we see his face at last.<br> Bois-Guilbert, you hold my father<br> and his train.<br> This issue concerns only the two of us.<br> I charge you to release them<br> and make your case with me.<br> What is your bargain,<br> if I let the rest go free?<br> I'll surrender for fair trial before Prince John<br> if they are no longer prisoners in an hour.<br> Clap the dog in irons<br> and have done with him.<br> Come forward and surrender,<br> and the rest shall go free.<br> By the authority conferred upon me<br> by Prince John, you're my prisoner, lvanhoe.<br> You do not fool us, lvanhoe.<br> No man gives himself up to his enemies<br> like a drunken apple woman. What's afoot?<br> Are you afraid of what<br> one unarmed man might do?<br> I ask time alone with my father<br> to make my peace with him.<br> - Let him go and take me before Prince John.<br> - You shall see your father alone.<br> Take this knight to his father,<br> but guard him well. Go with him, De Bracy.<br> - I am in your debt, Bois-Guilbert.<br> - You shall repay it, lvanhoe.<br> Here's the old bull's pen.<br> He's roared himself silent, it would seem.<br> Show your head,<br> and I'll knock it off your neck!<br> A reunion should be touching.<br> Are you such a ninny<br> that you let them catch you too?<br> I'm the only one they want.<br> - Bois-Guilbert pledged that you can go free.<br> - And leave you here to hang?<br> Be still and hear me. Locksley<br> and his bowmen are all around us...<br> ...but you're the only leader skilled<br> in siege to take this keep.<br> He's waiting for you. Go to him.<br> Aye, right willingly.<br> You went with Richard in defiance<br> of my will, but all's forgotten, boy.<br> Perhaps you'll listen next time.<br> My father is ready to leave.<br> So he shall, when you've told us where<br> Richard's ransom money is hidden.<br> - Take them to the dungeons and bind them.<br> - This is the way you pledge your word!<br> You cursed Norman!<br> Bois-Guilbert, you shall hang for this!<br> Lvanhoe! Lvanhoe!<br> I heard lvanhoe's voice.<br> You did indeed, milady.<br> And I hope you heard it clearly.<br> It'll be many a long year<br> before you hear it again.<br> If Prince John harms Sir lvanhoe...<br> ...may the curse of every Saxon bring ruin<br> and disaster upon the heads of you all.<br> May death blight you as you stand<br> and walk and ride and sleep.<br> Curse Prince John all you wish, but he'll<br> still put England's crown upon his head.<br> And I shall sit at his feet<br> when he's king.<br> So will you. We are neither of us fools.<br> - We?<br> - Yes, we.<br> You are the last in line<br> of the old Saxon royalty.<br> Now that Cedric can't find a Saxon king<br> for you to marry...<br> ...I am, by far, the most eligible<br> of the new order.<br> - Are you mad?<br> - No, dear lady, only ambitious.<br> I have a taste for beauty<br> and a love for money...<br> ...and you have both.<br> I see I shall have to mend<br> your Saxon manners for you.<br> Even that will be a pleasure.<br> Come in. Come in, Sir lvanhoe.<br> We were about to tickle<br> the old Jew into speech...<br> ...but you'll take precedence, being a Saxon<br> knight. String him up beside the other.<br> - Delay the questioning till I return.<br> - Return fast...<br> ...or 150,000 marks of silver may go.<br> - I shall be swift.<br> What have you done with my father?<br> Front De Boeuf plays host to him,<br> as I play host to you.<br> May God have mercy on him, then.<br> We are merciful men, Rebecca...<br> ...when our mercy is appealed to.<br> If you hold us for a price, name it. Our<br> people will raise it if my father is unharmed.<br> Your people cannot pay it.<br> You are the price, Rebecca...<br> ...and I am the collector of the debt.<br> Then you are a false coward<br> who believes in nothing...<br> ...least of all your vows of chivalry.<br> On the contrary, my vows of chivalry<br> bid me slay the infidel...<br> ...but my heart is stronger than my sword.<br> I shall possess you, Rebecca,<br> if I die for it.<br> Try to possess me,<br> and we shall both die for it.<br> I now, and you when Richard<br> returns to England.<br> You deny me because of lvanhoe,<br> do you not?<br> What would you say if he were within these<br> walls, held captive with the rest of you?<br> I would despise you for a liar.<br> Nevertheless, he is here.<br> You don't believe me, do you?<br> How, then, if I say he came delivering<br> himself as a hostage for his father...<br> ...and we took him without violence?<br> Still not enough?<br> How, then, if the bandage on the shoulder<br> of his shield arm were of fine linen...<br> ...and if the linen were fastened<br> with a golden pin?<br> I believe you.<br> Then believe this also.<br> He cannot save you.<br> But you can save him...<br> ...not by dying, but by living.<br> If you die, so does he and all the rest.<br> There are many ways of dying...<br> ...and this is the basest.<br> You mistake the nature of our bargain,<br> Rebecca. I want you alive, not dead.<br> When next I come to you,<br> meet me with desire in your breast...<br> ...or no man's life is saved.<br> The fire's at white heat, milord.<br> Tell us where the ransom's hidden,<br> and I'll make your dying fast instead of slow.<br> If you harm him, you Norman dog...<br> ...every Saxon in England<br> will avenge his blood.<br> Ever seen half a beef turning on a spit?<br> I've seen whole traitors.<br> Well-basted, they drip a rich, red gravy.<br> I command you, deliver up the captives<br> that you hold...<br> ...or suffer siege and attack!<br> This demand, we make but once!<br> Shall we hire him for a jester<br> or hang him for a lout?<br> Get you gone from here before we flay you<br> for your empty boasting!<br> I'll show you how emptily I boast.<br> Where's your laughter, Norman?<br> Does my jest fall flat?<br> Another blast on that horn<br> and even the trees will come alive.<br> - Have you men enough to hold the keep?<br> - Against that rabble?<br> - Twice as many as I need.<br> - I doubt it.<br> That rabble's drunk with hate of us.<br> Then let us feed their hate.<br> Bring lvanhoe to the battlement.<br> Cut him down.<br> Ready arrows!<br> I'll have your answer, Normans!<br> You have it, Saxon! Look, you.<br> One false move, and your knight shall hang<br> before your eyes.<br> Now, take your men and get you gone.<br> Hold fast, Locksley! In the name of Richard,<br> attack and wipe them out!<br> Why waste good rope?<br> This is how we deliver up<br> the captives that we hold.<br> Here comes the first!<br> Cut me loose or I take your master<br> to his death!<br> Cut nothing or I'll cut your throats!<br> If he has me, I also have him.<br> De Boeuf's a brave enough fool.<br> Too brave to lose.<br> Cut him loose!<br> I order it!<br> Away arrows!<br> After him!<br> - Blast! I lost him!<br> - We'll catch him soon.<br> - Look to your men. We're under siege.<br> - Sound the alarm!<br> Up drawbridge! Down portcullis!<br> Trumpets, sound every man to post!<br> Armor and swords!<br> To the drawbridge!<br> How goes it with us?<br> Locksley's attacking.<br> Show me a Norman throat.<br> Can Saxons fight?<br> - All day and through the night!<br> - All day and through the night!<br> It works for us! Feed it! Keep it going!<br> Hold!<br> Forward!<br> They're going to charge us<br> from the drawbridge gate.<br> Stand ready with your bows!<br> - Corked in like cider in a jug, eh?<br> - And now to burst the jug.<br> To the walls!<br> The keep's afire.<br> This time, men must go<br> where arrows went before.<br> - Can you take the barbican?<br> - What, that dog kennel? Single-handed.<br> Take it, then.<br> They can't fight fire and Saxons.<br> De Boeuf!<br> - Take 12 men and stamp that fire out.<br> - Hold!<br> - The fire must wait. We need your men.<br> - Then I'll do it myself, with two to help.<br> - What next, milord?<br> - Our women next. Where's Rowena?<br> - Close to the cell they locked me in.<br> - And Rebecca?<br> - We must look for her.<br> - No! Look for me, and look your last!<br> Make ready the boulders!<br> Away!<br> Rowena.<br> Come on! Hurry!<br> Faster! Faster! Ram!<br> Faster! Ram!<br> Ram! Ram!<br> The barbican's fallen. We've lost<br> the castle. It's the end of us all.<br> There's one chance left.<br> Not noble, but our last.<br> We could force through on horseback.<br> - Run before them, we two?<br> - We four. We use the women as our shields.<br> Come with me quickly!<br> The castle's in flames!<br> - Follow me. You're in danger.<br> - I'll die before I'll follow you.<br> No time for lovers' quarrels.<br> You will roast.<br> - Why make me use...<br> - Turn and defend yourself, De Bracy!<br> Enough. I cry quarter.<br> Where have you hidden Rebecca?<br> I fear you'll be too late.<br> Bois-Guilbert has fled with her.<br> Down drawbridge!<br> Hold your arrows! The maid's with him!<br> So Torquilstone is lost,<br> and you are our only prisoner, infidel.<br> Your pardon, my liege. My prisoner.<br> - Our prisoner.<br> - But, my liege...<br> Return to your keep until my plans are made<br> and I send for you again.<br> - What of my prisoner?<br> - She will remain within these walls.<br> - My liege...<br> - You have our leave to go hence.<br> Your defeat at Torquilstone can still be<br> twisted to advantage, Your Highness.<br> With the castle burned,<br> the good Boeuf dead...<br> ...and lvanhoe running loose,<br> gathering that infernal ransom...<br> ...with both hands?<br> - And the maid Rebecca in your hands.<br> A sorceress, taught by a witch<br> who was burnt at the stake.<br> - And you believe that nonsense?<br> - No, but your people shall.<br> I think you have the spade with which<br> to bury Richard at last.<br> Who needs more wealth<br> for Richard's ransom?<br> We're the new rich, milord.<br> We bank for the Normans<br> and lend to the Saxons.<br> From a Norman who has<br> no further use for it.<br> He plays a harp instead.<br> And this from his lady,<br> who gave everything she had to the poor.<br> Bless her generous nature.<br> Disclose no more former owners,<br> you villain...<br> ...lest my name be among them.<br> - Is this enough yet?<br> - Not yet.<br> From the people of Israel,<br> So do we fulfill our part of the pledge<br> to ransom Richard.<br> One hundred thousand marks of silver<br> in that scrap of nothing?<br> We need help for Richard<br> that a man can see and touch.<br> That scrap of nothing<br> is not nothing, milord.<br> There are merchants in Vienna<br> who owe sums to our people in York.<br> These writings call on our debtors<br> to pay what they owe in Austrian gold.<br> Can you also convert this weighty trash<br> to writings?<br> It shall be done.<br> My son.<br> - Have you news of Rebecca?<br> - Aye, at last.<br> Isaac, prepare your heart<br> for evil tidings.<br> Prince John holds your daughter captive<br> in the royal castle at Wallingford.<br> What is the charge against her?<br> I do not know. But you have 40 days<br> in which to find the ransom.<br> One hundred thousand marks of silver,<br> the very sum you give to Richard.<br> Can you raise as much again?<br> John knew that when he named the sum.<br> Then use what you have to free Rebecca.<br> We'll search again to find the ransom.<br> We lose a king,<br> or you lose your child.<br> Your will is ours, Isaac.<br> My will is God's.<br> Free the king.<br> Richard would not accept his throne<br> at such a price.<br> My daughter does not die<br> to save Richard's throne, Sir lvanhoe.<br> She dies to save her people.<br> Then I pledge my word to put all else aside<br> until she's free again.<br> But the ransom.<br> Who will take it to Austria?<br> - You will, sire.<br> - Aye, that I will.<br> Why are you so pale?<br> Are you afraid for me?<br> I shall only know that<br> when Rebecca is free.<br> That will be soon.<br> But will lvanhoe still be lvanhoe?<br> A man torn is two men.<br> I will still be lvanhoe.<br> Perhaps, and perhaps not.<br> The choice is yours, lvanhoe,<br> not mine and not Rebecca's.<br> Do you think I go to her aid<br> because I love her?<br> I shall know that when I know<br> where pity ends and love begins.<br> I am afraid, lvanhoe...<br> ...and I am jealous.<br> Go and free her.<br> Farewell.<br> Rise, infidel, so that the court<br> may gaze upon your face.<br> The infidel, Rebecca of York,<br> stands accused of the foul crimes...<br> ...of sorcery and black magic.<br> Let her trial begin.<br> The witness, Roger of Bermondsley,<br> a soldier at arms.<br> Tell the court what you know<br> of this woman.<br> At the castle of Torquilstone...<br> ...with my own eyes I saw this accused<br> perched on the highest parapet of the tower.<br> With my own ears I heard her call<br> upon the powers of darkness.<br> Forthwith, she was changed<br> into a black swan...<br> ...which three times circled the castle<br> and returned to the tower...<br> ...and was again this accused!<br> - My lord!<br> - The tribunal will address you...<br> ...when fitting, knight. Until then,<br> be you silent or quit this court!<br> I draw my wage, milords, as servant<br> to Isaac of York in Sheffield town.<br> Some nights past,<br> I heard the sound of chanting...<br> ...and I looked through a keyhole.<br> Through this I saw the body of a knight<br> lying dead on a pallet.<br> Above him crouched this evil spirit...<br> ...speaking in a soft tongue...<br> ...and lo, the knight stirred<br> and came back to life again.<br> Can you name this knight?<br> The name Sir Wilfred of lvanhoe<br> was spoken...<br> ...and he rose and replied as alive as me.<br> You may go.<br> Forgive me, milady! They made me say it!<br> The words of Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert<br> to the accused were these:<br> "I confess to living under a spell.<br> Who could cast it so well as you?<br> Who could bind me so fast<br> except a sorceress?"<br> Did the witch reply?<br> Only by the use of her evil powers...<br> ...which cast a palsy<br> into the knight's hand...<br> ...and drove him from her presence.<br> My lord, he lies. This woman<br> is no more a witch than you or I.<br> What further proof do you need than that<br> of the knight's bewitchment?<br> I lent my sanction to this inquiry<br> with a heavy heart...<br> ...but a duty seen must be discharged.<br> Like a plague passing from hand to hand...<br> ...so the scourge of witchcraft<br> spreads across this land...<br> ...even to men in other lands.<br> Aye, even to my brother Richard.<br> - No!<br> - No!<br> Aye, Richard, long sought by me<br> and long thought dead, has been found.<br> But better by far that he had died...<br> ...for he has fallen into the hands<br> of sorcerers and idolaters.<br> Consider this:<br> If one of their tribe can so deprave a man<br> like the Saxon lvanhoe...<br> ...and a man like the Norman<br> Bois-Guilbert...<br> ...what has the whole tribe done to Richard,<br> who is also a man?<br> They found him,<br> and with their accursed gold...<br> ...they bought his freedom and his soul.<br> Now he will try to return to these shores,<br> but he is no longer the Richard who left.<br> He is a man seduced and bewitched,<br> in league with the infidel against England.<br> Never was a king more cheaply bought.<br> - No!<br> - No!<br> I say save England without spilling<br> one drop of English blood.<br> For as the servant of the Jews,<br> who would call Richard English?<br> I say burn this infidel!<br> And with the same torch, drive her people<br> into the sea and Richard with them.<br> - No!<br> - No!<br> Justice of this court<br> allows the prisoner...<br> ...to speak in her own defense.<br> I was taught healing<br> by Miriam of Manassas.<br> That is true.<br> But I have always sought<br> to use that skill...<br> ...in the service of man, to relieve his pain.<br> If this convicts me of witchcraft,<br> and with me, my people...<br> ...then may God pity every man...<br> ...who seeks mercy and justice<br> from his fellow men.<br> For the only merciful power<br> in this world is death...<br> ...and the only justice is beyond the grave.<br> I am innocent.<br> Milords, before the prisoner<br> convicts herself out of her own mouth...<br> ...I demand the right to address her<br> before the court.<br> - Shall I refuse?<br> - No. Let him speak.<br> Your request is granted by the court,<br> sir knight.<br> This court long ago closed its eyes<br> and ears to your fate, Rebecca.<br> You will be found guilty...<br> ...and you will be burnt at the stake...<br> ...and the ashes of your body<br> will be scattered to the four winds.<br> I pray my people will not be ashamed<br> of the way I die.<br> The trial cannot be halted,<br> but the sentence can.<br> When charged, confess.<br> To what? Crimes I have not committed?<br> No matter, confess and ask for pardon.<br> They must grant it on one condition:<br> That you renounce the faith of Israel.<br> I would not live in the world you offer.<br> It has neither sun nor moon,<br> nor air to breathe.<br> It has no faith, no love, no honor.<br> When you leave it,<br> I think it will have no life.<br> Enough. You waste the time of the court.<br> Proceed.<br> It is the solemn judgment of this court...<br> ...that Rebecca of York be pronounced<br> a witch...<br> ...infected with satanic powers<br> and guilty of demoniacal arts.<br> For this, we abandon her<br> to her punishment:<br> Death by fire.<br> Hold, milords!<br> I, Wilfred of lvanhoe,<br> do challenge the judgment of this tribunal.<br> I demand that her guilt or innocence...<br> ...be determined in the eyes of God<br> by wager of battle.<br> Instruct me if this wager of battle<br> is mandatory upon the court.<br> It is, sire. An appeal<br> to God's judgment...<br> ...cannot be denied by common<br> or canon law.<br> Unless the accused rejects the offer<br> of championship.<br> What says the accused?<br> I accept the offer with all my heart.<br> - May the court choose its own champion?<br> - It may, sire.<br> Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert, you shall accept<br> this challenge on behalf of the court.<br> I do humbly accept<br> the honor bestowed upon me...<br> ...to uphold the mercy and justice<br> of my prince by wager of battle.<br> Court so orders.<br> On the third day hence,<br> let the wager of battle be fought...<br> ...in the lists at Ashby...<br> ...to the death.<br> As master of the lists,<br> I hereby charge ye...<br> ...that if either combatant violate<br> the laws of chivalry...<br> ...I will cry, "Foul craven!" And upon<br> the casting of my truncheon to the ground...<br> ...the offender shall instantly be slain<br> by the royal bowmen.<br> Rebecca, once I enter these lists<br> in combat...<br> ...I must maintain my name in arms.<br> And if I do so, lvanhoe dies quickly...<br> ...and then you in such pain as they say<br> is in store for the guilty hereafter.<br> If I withdraw now, lvanhoe wins by default,<br> and you both will live...<br> ...while I shall fall from grace, a degraded<br> knight without fame and without honor.<br> All this I would endure if you would say:<br> "Bois-Guilbert, I turn from lvanhoe to you."<br> We are all in God's hands, sir knight.<br> Then count your life by seconds,<br> and the Saxon's life as well.<br> Since you ride for the court, Bois-Guilbert,<br> choose first.<br> - What arm do you elect to bear?<br> - I bear mace and chain this day.<br> Your foe declares for close combat.<br> This denies to you the lance.<br> Therefore, elect from ax or blade.<br> I choose the ax.<br> Arm you, then, valiant sirs,<br> and to your stations.<br> May God defend the right.<br> May God defend the right!<br> Beware, Saxon, lest you strike horse!<br> Lvanhoe, God spare you.<br> Rebecca.<br> You must blame the Fates that it was<br> I who loved you and not Sir lvanhoe.<br> But you were always mine...<br> ...and only mine.<br> God keep you.<br> Milady, in death he spoke the truth.<br> You still love lvanhoe?<br> No, milady.<br> I stole a little happiness, perhaps...<br> ...but not from him or you...<br> ...only from my dreams.<br> His heart was always yours.<br> Before me kneels a nation divided.<br> Rise as one man,<br> and that one for England!<br> Long live England!<br> Long live England!<br>
