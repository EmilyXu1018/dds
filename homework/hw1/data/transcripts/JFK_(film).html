                        January, 1961.<br> President Dwight D. Eisenhower's<br> Farewell Address to the Nation.<br> This conjunction of an immense military<br> establishment and arms industry is new...<br> ...in the American experience.<br> The total influence...<br> ...economic, political, even spiritual...<br> ...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,<br> every government office.<br> We must guard against the acquisition...<br> ...of unwarranted influence,<br> whether sought or unsought...<br> ...by the military-industrial complex.<br> We must never let the weight<br> of this combination...<br> ...endanger our liberties<br> or democratic processes.<br> November, 1960.<br> Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy<br> of Massachusetts...<br> ...wins one of the narrowest election<br> victories in American history...<br> ...over Vice President Richard Nixon<br> by a little more than 100,000 votes.<br> Alongside his beautiful<br> and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier...<br> ...Kennedy is the symbol<br> of the new freedom of the 1960s...<br> ...signifying change and upheaval<br> to the American public.<br> "All men are created equal. "<br> Every degree of mind and spirit<br> that I possess will be devoted...<br> ...to the cause of freedom<br> around the world.<br> Today, the proudest boast is:<br> "Ich bin ein Berliner! "<br> He inherits a secret war against the<br> Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...<br> ...a war run by the CIA<br> and angry Cuban exiles.<br> Castro is a successful revolutionary...<br> ...frightening to American business<br> interests in Latin America.<br> This war culminates in the disastrous<br> Bay of Pigs invasion...<br> ...in April, 1961...<br> ...when Kennedy refuses to provide<br> air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.<br> Kennedy takes public responsibility<br> for the failure.<br> He privately claims the CIA lied to him...<br> ...and tried to manipulate him into ordering<br> an American invasion of Cuba.<br> In October, 1962...<br> ...the world comes to the brink<br> of nuclear war...<br> ...when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...<br> ...after announcing the presence<br> of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...<br> ...90 miles off American shores.<br> Soviet ships with more missiles<br> sail towards Cuba...<br> ...but at the last moment they turn back.<br> The world breathes with relief.<br> In Washington, rumors abound<br> that JFK has cut a secret deal...<br> ...with Russian Premier Khrushchev...<br> ...not to invade Cuba in return<br> for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.<br> Suspicions abound that Kennedy<br> is soft on communism.<br> Kennedy also finds himself embroiled<br> in Laos and Vietnam.<br> We've got our difficulties there.<br> Unless a greater effort is made<br> by the government...<br> ...to win popular support,<br> I don't think the war can be won there.<br> It's their war. They're the ones<br> who have to win it or lose it.<br> Early that fateful summer...<br> ...Kennedy speaks of his new vision<br> at the American University.<br> What kind of peace do I mean?<br> What kind of peace do we seek?<br> Not a Pax Americana...<br> ...enforced on the world<br> by American weapons of war.<br> We must re-examine our own attitudes<br> towards the Soviet Union.<br> Our most basic, common link...<br> ...is that we all inhabit...<br> ...this small planet.<br> We all breathe the same air.<br> We all cherish our children's futures.<br> And we are all mortal.<br> You fucking assholes!<br> Don't leave me here!<br> They've gone to Dallas.<br> Friday.<br> They're going to kill...<br> ...Kennedy.<br> Call somebody.<br> Stop them.<br> These are serious fucking guys.<br> She's been high on something<br> since they brought her in.<br> Help!<br> Please!<br> Here is a bulletin from CBS News.<br> In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...<br> ...at President Kennedy's motorcade<br> in downtown Dallas.<br> The first reports say<br> that President Kennedy...<br> ...has been seriously wounded<br> by the shooting.<br> What's wrong?<br> The President's been shot.<br> In Dallas. Five minutes ago.<br> Oh, no!<br> How bad?<br> No word. They think it's in the head.<br> Napoleon's has a TV set.<br> Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally<br> also appeared to have been hit.<br> The President was rushed to Parkland<br> Memorial Hospital, four miles away.<br> We are told the bullet entered the base<br> of the throat and came out the back...<br> ...but there is no confirmation.<br> Blood transfusions are being given.<br> A priest has administered the last rites.<br> There's still a chance.<br> Pull through, Jack.<br> From Dallas...<br> ...the flash, apparently official:<br> President Kennedy died...<br> ...at 1:00 p. m. Central Standard Time...<br> ...2:00 Eastern Standard Time...<br> ...some 38 minutes ago.<br> Vice President Johnson<br> has left the hospital.<br> Presumably he will take<br> the oath of office shortly...<br> ...and become the 36th President<br> of the United States.<br> He did so much for this country,<br> for colored people. Why?<br> Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!<br> Shut the fuck up!<br> I'm ashamed to be an American today.<br> The President of the United States is dead.<br> I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert<br> of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.<br> He told me...<br> ...President Kennedy has been given<br> the last rites.<br> Shortly after 12:30...<br> ...near the park in downtown Dallas...<br> ...the shots rang out.<br> The President is dead.<br> The bullets came up over our heads...<br> ...from that fence up on the knoll.<br> I seen his face when it hit.<br> His ear blew off and he turned real white.<br> He flopped over on his stomach...<br> ...with his foot sticking out.<br> None of us thought it could happen<br> in America or any place else.<br> All this blubbering over<br> that no-count son of a bitch!<br> They're bawling like they knew the man.<br> Makes me want to puke.<br> For God's sake, the President was shot.<br> A bullshit President!<br> Nobody's crying for the thousands<br> of Cubans...<br> ...that bastard condemned to death<br> and torture at Bay of Pigs.<br> Goddamn peace treaties!<br> I heard shots from over there.<br> - I heard shots from over there.<br> - How many?<br> That's what happens<br> when you let the niggers vote.<br> They get together with the Jews<br> and the Catholics...<br> ...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.<br> Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.<br> Bullshit!<br> Here's to the New Frontier.<br> Camelot in smithereens.<br> I'll drink to that.<br> Dallas police have just announced...<br> ...they have a suspect in the killing<br> of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit...<br> ...who was shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff,<br> a Dallas suburb.<br> Police say there could be a tie-in<br> to the President's murder.<br> The suspect,<br> identified as a Lee Harvey Oswald...<br> ...was arrested by more<br> than a dozen policemen...<br> ...after a short scuffle at a movie theater<br> in Oak Cliff.<br> Officer Tippit was killed...<br> ...by a revolver which was found<br> on Oswald.<br> Shoot the bastard!<br> Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!<br> I don't know what I am charged with...<br> ...but I emphatically deny these charges.<br> The kid must've gone nuts, right?<br> I said, Oswald must've flipped.<br> Right?<br> Just did this crazy thing<br> before anybody could stop him.<br> I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Who'd have ever thought...<br> ...that goofy Oswald kid would pull<br> a stunt like an assassination?<br> Goes to show you can never know<br> about some people. Am I right, Jack?<br> Am I right, Jack?<br> Well, bless my soul.<br> All these years,<br> I thought you were on my team.<br> Are you kidding?<br> I couldn't be more serious, Jack.<br> Your little red eyes have me wondering<br> about your loyalty.<br> Look at that, Martin.<br> Who's been going through my files?<br> You've been looking through my files,<br> you little weasel!<br> You're starting to get paranoid. Really!<br> You went through all my files!<br> You're a goddamn spy!<br> Why would I want to look<br> through your files?<br> I've seen enough here this summer<br> to write a book.<br> I always lock my files!<br> You're the only one here today.<br> What do you mean, you bastard?<br> You're going to write a book?<br> You know what I mean.<br> I've seen a lot of strange things here.<br> Strange people.<br> You didn't see a goddamn thing!<br> Not a goddamn thing!<br> The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.<br> - Did you shoot the President?<br> - I didn't shoot anybody.<br> They have taken me in<br> because I have lived in the Soviet Union.<br> I'm just a patsy!<br> He sure looks like a creep.<br> I protested at that time I was not allowed<br> legal representation...<br> ...during that very short and sweet hearing.<br> I really don't know...<br> ...what this situation is about.<br> Nobody has told me anything<br> except that I am accused...<br> ...of murdering a policeman.<br> I know nothing more than that.<br> I do request someone to come forward...<br> ...to give me legal assistance.<br> Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement<br> or whatever it's called?<br> It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.<br> Why were you in Russia?<br> What happened to your eye?<br> He seems pretty cool<br> for a man under pressure.<br> A policeman hit me.<br> He gives me the willies.<br> Come on, sugarplums,<br> it's past your bedtimes.<br> Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.<br> A fine man.<br> After a stint in the Marines...<br> ...he became fascinated by communism.<br> He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...<br> ...and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro<br> and ultra left-wing causes.<br> He spent last summer in New Orleans<br> and was arrested...<br> ...in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.<br> Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.<br> Matter of routine. Get on<br> this Oswald connection in New Orleans.<br> Check out his record. Find any friends<br> or associates from last summer.<br> Let's meet with the investigators<br> day after tomorrow.<br> On Sunday?<br> Sunday. 11:00.<br> Thanks, Lou.<br> I would say that he is the killer...<br> ...beyond a reasonable doubt<br> and to a moral certainty.<br> I thought a motorcycle had backfired.<br> I looked to my left.<br> A second shot hit him in the face.<br> The rifle, a cheap World War ll,<br> Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano...<br> ...was ordered from<br> a Chicago mailing house...<br> ...and shipped to Oswald's alias,<br> A. Hidell...<br> ...at a post office box in March of 1963.<br> This same rifle was used<br> to assassinate the President.<br> That ties it up.<br> Another nut. Jesus Christ,<br> anybody can get a rifle in Texas!<br> As far as Oswald's associates,<br> one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.<br> Oswald was seen with him<br> several times last summer.<br> I know David. Strange character.<br> He's been in trouble before. He was<br> a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.<br> Got canned after an alleged<br> homosexual incident.<br> These photos were found yesterday<br> among Oswald's possessions...<br> ...in the garage where Marina Oswald<br> and her children are living.<br> Somebody mentioned Ferrie<br> on that Texas trip. Find that out.<br> He no shoot anyone.<br> He good man. Good husband.<br> So it seems David Ferrie drove off<br> on Friday afternoon for Texas.<br> A source said he might have been<br> a getaway pilot for Oswald.<br> Hold your horses.<br> What kind of source?<br> The anonymous kind, Chief.<br> I remember Ferrie speaking<br> at a meeting of some veterans' group...<br> ...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.<br> They're bringing him out.<br> Numa, turn it up.<br> Here he comes!<br> Anything to say in your defense?<br> Oswald!<br> He shot him!<br> He shot him on TV!<br> There's a man with a gun!<br> Seventy cops there.<br> What were they doing?<br> No trial now. Somebody just saved<br> the Dallas DA a pile of work.<br> Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.<br> It's wrong. This is crazy!<br> Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,<br> the business of government went on.<br> The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,<br> our Ambassador to Vietnam...<br> ...and members of his Cabinet.<br> The major subject was Vietnam...<br> ...a crisis that does not pause<br> for bereavement.<br> From this meeting...<br> ...came affirmations that<br> the US would continue aiding...<br> ...the new government of Vietnam in<br> its war against the Communist insurgents.<br> David Ferrie.<br> Come on in.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Remember me? We met<br> on Carondelet Street after your election.<br> I remember.<br> You make quite an impression.<br> I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.<br> Legend has it you can get in<br> and out of the smallest field.<br> I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers<br> for the field artillery in the war.<br> Make yourself comfortable.<br> Mind if I smoke?<br> How could I?<br> As you know, President Kennedy<br> was assassinated on Friday.<br> A man named Lee Harvey Oswald<br> was arrested as a suspect...<br> ...then murdered yesterday<br> by a man named Jack Ruby.<br> We've had reports that Oswald<br> spent the summer here...<br> ...and that you knew Oswald.<br> I've never met anyone named Oswald.<br> Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.<br> He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit<br> when he was a teenager.<br> If he did, I don't remember him.<br> Lots of boys in and out.<br> Surely you've seen this. Perhaps<br> you knew him under another name?<br> I never saw him before in my life.<br> Then we must have gotten<br> mistaken information.<br> Thanks for straightening it out.<br> There's one other matter.<br> We heard you went to Texas<br> shortly after the assassination on Friday.<br> True. I drove to Houston.<br> What was so appealing about Houston?<br> I hadn't been ice-skating lately.<br> Some young friends and I...<br> ...decided to go skating.<br> Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...<br> ...during one of the worst thunderstorms<br> in recent memory?<br> Spur-of-the-moment thing.<br> Storm wasn't that bad.<br> Where did you drive?<br> We went to Houston.<br> Saturday we drove to Galveston,<br> and stayed there.<br> And Sunday?<br> In the morning, we went goose hunting.<br> Did you bag any?<br> The boys got a couple.<br> Boys said they didn't get any.<br> They're right.<br> There were thousands<br> of geese everywhere.<br> But you couldn't approach them.<br> They're wise.<br> Your friends said you had no weapons.<br> Isn't it difficult to hunt geese<br> without a shotgun?<br> I remember now. I'm sorry.<br> I got confused.<br> We got near the geese, then realized<br> we had forgotten our shotguns.<br> Stupid, right?<br> So, of course, we didn't get any geese.<br> Thank you for your time.<br> Sorry this must end inconveniently...<br> ...but I must detain you for questioning<br> by the FBl.<br> Why? What's wrong?<br> Your story is not believable.<br> Really?<br> What part?<br> This afternoon the FBI released<br> David W. Ferrie...<br> ...of New Orleans.<br> After extensive questioning<br> and a background check...<br> ...the Bureau found no evidence<br> that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...<br> ...or had any connection<br> with the assassination.<br> The agent in charge would like<br> to make clear...<br> ...that Ferrie was brought in<br> for questioning...<br> ...by the District Attorney<br> of Orleans Parish.<br> I thought we were on the same side.<br> Why are they saying that?<br> Pretty fast, the way they let him go.<br> They must know something we don't.<br> So let's get on with our lives.<br> We have many homegrown crimes<br> to prosecute.<br> The President has announced...<br> ...the creation of a commission<br> to probe the events in Dallas.<br> It will be headed<br> by Chief Justice Earl Warren...<br> ...and is expected to head off<br> several Congressional and Texas inquiries.<br> On the panel are Allen Dulles,<br> ex-chief of the CIA...<br> ...Representative Gerald Ford,<br> banker John McCloy...<br> Fucking out of control.<br> All these hippies running around on drugs.<br> You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.<br> I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.<br> You could see her whole belly.<br> You know what she had painted on it?<br> "Love Child. "<br> It's a mess down there, Jim.<br> We've bitten off more Vietnam<br> than we can chew.<br> It figures with that polecat Lyndon<br> in the White House.<br> I sometimes think things have gone<br> downhill since Kennedy died.<br> Don't get me started on that.<br> Those Warren Commission fellows<br> were picking gnat shit out of pepper.<br> Nobody's going to tell me that kid<br> shot like he did from that bookstore.<br> But the FBI test-fired the rifle<br> to see if it could be done.<br> Three experts and not one<br> of them could do it.<br> They say that Oswald got off three shots<br> with world-class precision...<br> ...from a manual bolt-action rifle<br> in less than six seconds.<br> According to his Marine buddies,<br> he got Maggie's drawers.<br> That means he wasn't any good.<br> Average man would be lucky<br> to shoot twice.<br> And the first would be the best.<br> Here the third shot's perfect.<br> And they got that bullet zigzagging<br> all over the place...<br> ...hitting Kennedy and Connally<br> seven times.<br> One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.<br> Something's always bothered me<br> about that from day one.<br> Think other men were involved?<br> If I was investigating the case, I'd round<br> up 100 of the world's best riflemen...<br> ...and find out which ones were<br> in Dallas that day.<br> You been duck hunting.<br> Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.<br> What did he say? "I'm just a patsy! "<br> Believe it.<br> Dinner's just about ready.<br> Got a surprise for you tonight.<br> Tried something new.<br> - What?<br> - Dinner.<br> Smells good. Do you know Oswald...<br> ...was interrogated for 12 hours<br> after the assassination...<br> ...with no lawyer present,<br> and nobody recorded a word of it.<br> I can't believe it. An experienced<br> police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...<br> ...had to know that with no record,<br> what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.<br> Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.<br> Sure it is.<br> If I handled a minor felon that way,<br> it'd be all over the papers.<br> This is the alleged murderer<br> of the President.<br> Again and again<br> credible testimony's ignored.<br> Leads are not followed up,<br> conclusions are selective, no index.<br> It's the sloppiest investigation<br> I've ever seen.<br> Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...<br> ...coming from the grassy knoll<br> in front of Kennedy...<br> ...not the Book Depository behind him.<br> But it's broken down and spread around.<br> You read it, but the point is lost.<br> I never believed it.<br> I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.<br> Elizabeth, your bedtime too!<br> That was three years ago.<br> We've tried to put it out of our minds.<br> You keep digging it up.<br> You're the DA of New Orleans.<br> Isn't the Kennedy assassination<br> a bit out of your domain?<br> All those important people studied it.<br> I can't believe a man as intelligent<br> as Earl Warren read those volumes.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> You got an hour to solve the case<br> while I get the kids in bed.<br> Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy<br> will have to wait until morning.<br> Look, Dad. Look what I drew.<br> That's something. What is it?<br> It's a rhino in a cage.<br> - Can I stay up another hour?<br> - I don't think so, Son.<br> Pickle and Snapper, my two...<br> ...dancing partners.<br> Good night, doodlebugs.<br> One hour, you hear?<br> Some Saturday-night date you are.<br> Mama warned me this would happen<br> if I married such a serious man as you.<br> When I come up, I'll show you<br> how Saturday night got invented.<br> I sealed off the area and held off the<br> trains till they could be examined.<br> There were some transients taken on<br> at least one train.<br> Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us<br> about this matter. Is that correct?<br> Yes.<br> Is there anything else you told us...<br> ...that I haven't asked you about,<br> that you can think of?<br> Nothing that I can recall.<br> Witness is excused.<br> A long freight was in there...<br> ...and we pulled some people off<br> and took them to the station.<br> Do you mean some transients?<br> Tramps and hobos.<br> Were they questioned?<br> They were questioned at the station.<br> Ask the question.<br> Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.<br> Traffic had been cut off<br> into the area since 10:00.<br> But three cars came in during this time...<br> ...from around noon till the time<br> of the shooting.<br> They circled the parking lot and left.<br> Like they was checking the area.<br> One of the drivers...<br> ...was holding something up to his mouth.<br> The last car came in about seven<br> to ten minutes before the shooting.<br> It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.<br> Muddy up to the windows.<br> Towards the underpass, I saw two men...<br> ...standing behind a picket fence...<br> ...looking up towards Main and Houston,<br> as the caravan came down.<br> One of them was middle-aged...<br> ...heavyset.<br> The other man was younger.<br> Two other men were on the east end<br> of the parking lot.<br> They both had uniforms.<br> At the time of the shooting...<br> ...there seemed to be some commotion.<br> I'm just unable to describe...<br> ...a flash of light or smoke or something...<br> ...which caused me to feel that something<br> out of the ordinary...<br> ...had occurred on the embankment.<br> Goddamn.<br> No!<br> - You all right?<br> - Honey, it's incredible.<br> What?<br> The whole thing.<br> A Lt. Colonel testifies that...<br> ...Oswald had a Russian language exam<br> as part of his Marine training...<br> ...only a few months before he defects<br> to the Soviet Union.<br> A Russian exam.<br> It's 4:30 in the morning!<br> I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.<br> In all my years in the military, I never<br> knew a single man who had a Russian test.<br> Oswald was a radar operator.<br> He'd have about as much use for Russian<br> as a cat has for pajamas.<br> These books have gotten to your mind!<br> - Stop reading.<br> - He makes it sound like nothing.<br> Oswald did badly on his test.<br> He got only two more Russian words right<br> than wrong.<br> That's like me saying,<br> Touchdown is not very intelligent...<br> ...because I beat him three games<br> out of five when we played chess.<br> Are you going to stay up all night,<br> every night? For what?<br> To be the only man who's read<br> all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?<br> Do I have to spell it out for you?<br> Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.<br> He was in military intelligence,<br> that's why he was trained in Russian.<br> It was no accident he was in Russia.<br> - Go back to sleep.<br> - I've been sleeping for three years!<br> 'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?<br> Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.<br> Old stains, but just as telling.<br> Remember whose office this was in '63?<br> Sure. Guy Banister.<br> Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.<br> He headed the Chicago office. When he<br> retired he became a private eye here.<br> I used to have lunch with him.<br> John Birch Society, Minutemen.<br> To the right of Attila the Hun.<br> Recruited students to infiltrate<br> radical organizations on campus.<br> Headed the Anti-Communist League<br> of the Caribbean.<br> All out of this office.<br> I want to show you something.<br> Take a look here.<br> Same building, right?<br> Different addresses, different entrances,<br> both going to the same place...<br> ...to the office upstairs.<br> Guess who used it?<br> Lee Harvey Oswald.<br> How do we know that?<br> This address was stamped on...<br> ...pro-Castro leaflets he handed out<br> in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.<br> The same leaflets they found<br> in his garage in Dallas.<br> After the arrest, 544 Camp St.<br> never appeared on the pamphlets again.<br> He was arrested for fighting<br> with anti-Castro Cubans.<br> But he'd contacted them already...<br> ...as an ex-Marine trying<br> to join their anti-Castro crusade.<br> When they heard he was now pro-Castro,<br> they paid him a visit.<br> What's this Fidel shit? You lied to me!<br> Liar! Son of a bitch!<br> Do not take this Communist propaganda!<br> If you want to hit me, hit me.<br> You pinko shit!<br> Go back to Moscow!<br> There was no real fight.<br> The arresting Lieutenant later said<br> he felt it was a staged incident.<br> In jail, Oswald has a private session...<br> ...with Special Agent John Quigley<br> of the FBl.<br> Oswald is released.<br> And Quigley destroys his notes<br> from the interview.<br> The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.<br> And he appears on a local TV debate.<br> You are a Communist, are you not?<br> No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.<br> I'm a Marxist-Leninist.<br> Communist, Marxist-Leninist,<br> what's the difference?<br> What if I told you Oswald was trained<br> in the Russian language in the Marines?<br> I'd say he got intelligence training.<br> You were a Marine. Who'd run it?<br> Office of Naval Intelligence.<br> Look across the street.<br> Post Office.<br> Upstairs, in 1963,<br> that was the Office of Naval Intelligence.<br> By coincidence, Banister,<br> before he was FBl, was ONl.<br> What's their saying?<br> "Once ONl, always ONl. "<br> He likes working near his old pals.<br> We are standing in the heart...<br> ...of the US government's intelligence<br> community in New Orleans.<br> That's the FBl.<br> That's the CIA.<br> That's the Secret Service.<br> That's the ONl.<br> Isn't this a strange place...<br> ...for a Communist<br> to spend his spare time?<br> What are you driving at?<br> We're going back into the case.<br> The murder of the President.<br> Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.<br> You're awake. I'm deadly serious.<br> Let's track down your anonymous source<br> from three years ago.<br> How'd you find out David Ferrie drove<br> to Texas that day?<br> I can't remember last night,<br> let alone three years ago, Boss.<br> You're not being cross-examined.<br> I need clarification about the night<br> Guy Banister beat you over the head.<br> Don't tell me you don't remember.<br> You called our office from your hospital<br> bed. You were hopping mad about it.<br> Here's my problem.<br> You told me you and Guy were<br> good friends for a long time.<br> - Over ten years.<br> - And he never hit you before?<br> Never touched me.<br> Yet, on November 22, 1963...<br> ...the day of the President's murder...<br> ...the police report says...<br> ...he pistol-whipped you<br> with a. 357 Magnum.<br> It also says you argued<br> about the phone bill. Look!<br> Is an argument over a phone bill<br> a believable explanation to you?<br> There's more to it.<br> How much more?<br> I shouldn't talk about it.<br> I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.<br> Heart attack?<br> You buy what you read in the papers.<br> - You have other information?<br> - I didn't say that!<br> All I know is he died suddenly.<br> Just before the Warren Report came out.<br> Why did Guy beat you, Jack?<br> You were the only one here!<br> The only one here!<br> You didn't see a goddamn thing!<br> Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter<br> no more. It was all about those...<br> ...people that was hanging<br> around the office that summer.<br> I was never part of the operation.<br> I just handled their private-eye work<br> as it came in for Guy.<br> Not much did, but that's why I was there.<br> It was a nuthouse.<br> Cubans coming, going. And Christ,<br> they all looked the same to me.<br> You going to play with<br> this rifle or pack it?<br> Dave Ferrie.<br> - You know about him?<br> - We know Dave. Was he there?<br> He practically lived there.<br> The whole thing was...<br> ...all cloak-and-dagger stuff.<br> They called it "Operation Mongoose. "<br> The idea was to train these Cuban exiles<br> for another invasion of Cuba.<br> Banister's office was part<br> of the supply line...<br> ...from Dallas through New Orleans<br> to Miami.<br> We stockpiled arms, explosives.<br> In view of the intelligence community<br> in Lafayette Square?<br> Yes. Everybody knew everybody.<br> They were all part of the network.<br> All worked for the CIA.<br> Pilots and black operators<br> and civilians and the military.<br> Everybody was running guns then.<br> Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,<br> Morgan City, you name it.<br> McAllen, Texas? Big gun-run operation.<br> Where does Banister fit in?<br> He was running his camp<br> north of Lake Pontchartrain.<br> Ferrie did a lot of the training.<br> They had a shooting range<br> and tropical territory, like in Cuba.<br> Some Americans were trained there too.<br> Nazi types. Mercenaries.<br> That Ferrie, though,<br> Jesus, he was the craziest.<br> Late summer the party was over.<br> Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.<br> He told the FBl, "Shut up the camp.<br> "Confiscate the napalm, C-4 and all. "<br> The G-men were just going<br> through the motions.<br> Their hearts were still<br> with their old FBI buddy Banister.<br> Oswald?<br> He was there too.<br> Sometimes meeting with Banister.<br> With the door shut.<br> Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.<br> But he was there, all right.<br> Anything more specific, Jack?<br> It's important.<br> One time, the secretary got upset.<br> I can't believe it, Mr. Banister,<br> Oswald is down on Canal Street...<br> ...handing out Communist leaflets<br> supporting Castro.<br> It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.<br> Was anyone else involved at...<br> ...Banister's level?<br> One guy. I don't know who.<br> Big. White hair.<br> I saw him in the office once.<br> He looked out of place.<br> You know, a society guy.<br> Can't remember his name,<br> but Oswald was with him.<br> He had something to do with money,<br> because Banister never kissed ass...<br> ...but he kissed his.<br> Clay something.<br> That was his name. Clay...<br> - Bertrand?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Clay Bertrand?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Maybe not.<br> - No, that's right.<br> I must go.<br> He was in the Warren Report.<br> He got Oswald a lawyer.<br> Was Kennedy discussed?<br> I don't know.<br> - The assassination?<br> - No.<br> - Not with me. I've got to go.<br> - Hold on.<br> - That's all I'll say.<br> - What's the problem?<br> Do I have to spell it out for you?<br> Nobody knows what<br> we're talking about here.<br> You are so naive.<br> - When'd you do business with Bertrand?<br> - Pipe the bimbo in red.<br> - Lawdy.<br> - She's not as cute as you.<br> - You should try a legitimate business.<br> - Why are you dancing on my head?<br> - We've been friends since law school.<br> - Because you're conning me.<br> - I read your testimony.<br> - Grain of salt.<br> You said Clay Bertrand called you<br> the day after the assassination...<br> - ... and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.<br> - Right.<br> That's pretty important.<br> You told the FBI he's 6' 2".<br> Then you tell the Commission he's 5' 8".<br> How the hell does a man shrink like that?<br> They put the heat on me, like you. I gave<br> them whatever popped in my cabeza.<br> Truth is, I never met the dude.<br> - One likes friends that have friends.<br> - Indeed.<br> I don't know what that cat looks like<br> or where he's at.<br> All I know is sometimes<br> he sends me some cases.<br> One day he calls, talks to me<br> about repping Oswald in Dallas.<br> - You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?<br> - No.<br> I told that Bertrand cat right off<br> this ain't my scene.<br> - I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.<br> - Then how did you get in the Commission?<br> Like I told the Washington boys...<br> ...Bertrand asked me that summer to help<br> the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.<br> Mr. Bertrand said<br> he would take care of any of-<br> Fine.<br> - To whom am I speaking?<br> - Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.<br> There was no conspiracy. If there was,<br> why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?<br> He was his brother.<br> How'd so many people keep such a secret?<br> - It was Oswald. He hated-<br> - We're having a communication problem.<br> I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.<br> Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.<br> I'm aware of our friendship,<br> but I'll call you before the grand jury.<br> You lie to them as you lied to me,<br> I'll charge you with perjury.<br> I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.<br> I beat them all.<br> Am I communicating with you?<br> Off the record?<br> In that case, let me sum it up for you.<br> If I answer that question you keep asking...<br> ...if I give you the name<br> of the big enchilada...<br> ...then it's bon voyage, Deano.<br> Like a bullet in my head, you dig?<br> You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.<br> JFK's dead as that crabmeat.<br> The government's still breathing.<br> Either you give the grand jury<br> Clay Bertrand's real identity...<br> ...or your fat behind's<br> going to the slammer.<br> You're as crazy as your mama.<br> It's in the genes.<br> Do you know what you're getting into?<br> The government will jump all over<br> your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.<br> Good day to you, sir.<br> District Attorney Garrison<br> to see Prisoner 5388.<br> Ward block 237B.<br> We don't need gates with that swamp.<br> Many of them gone in there,<br> none of them came out.<br> You got visitors here.<br> Don't give them trouble.<br> - How you doing, Mr. Broussard?<br> - Let's go, Willie.<br> Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.<br> I got nothing but time.<br> Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.<br> Time stands still here,<br> like a snake sunning itself.<br> Clay Bertrand?<br> I met him sometime in...<br> ...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.<br> Dave Ferrie took me there<br> expressly to meet him.<br> Sexual purposes?<br> Did he pay you?<br> $20 each time. Ain't no secret.<br> That's what I'm in here for.<br> Anything unusual about him...<br> ...you'd be able to describe in court?<br> He had something wrong with his leg,<br> a limp.<br> Don't get me wrong.<br> He's not one of those limp wrists.<br> He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,<br> you'd never snap.<br> You could play poker with him,<br> go fishing, you'd never snap.<br> One night we were at David Ferrie's...<br> ...sometime late in the summer of '63.<br> There was about nine to ten people there.<br> Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff<br> in the bush with him. Place was a mess.<br> Dave's mind was a mess.<br> He had caged mice...<br> ...'cause he's working on a cancer cure.<br> Dave's smart, though.<br> Speaks five languages.<br> Knows philosophy, medicine,<br> military history, politics.<br> He wanted to be a priest.<br> They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.<br> That's where you first met Oswald?<br> Strange guy. Dave introduced him as...<br> Leon Oswald.<br> How you doing?<br> What the fuck is he doing here?<br> Fuck you, motherfucker.<br> Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.<br> You said Leon was actually<br> Lee Harvey Oswald?<br> Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.<br> I'm already in jail.<br> Go on.<br> Finally they left<br> and I was alone with Dave...<br> ...and this Leon...<br> ...two of the Cubans,<br> and this guy Bertrand.<br> Dave pulled out some clippings.<br> He'd been obsessed with Castro<br> and Kennedy for months.<br> Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!<br> Took our C-4!<br> Took 10,000 rounds!<br> All our weapons!<br> You want to free Cuba?<br> Whack out the fucking beard!<br> Kennedy won't let us.<br> Our hands are empty. How can we?<br> Problem is getting to him.<br> Informers on every block.<br> They got new stuff!<br> I could show you dozens of poisons!<br> Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.<br> No trace!<br> Put something in his beard,<br> make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous...<br> Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals<br> with that bastard Khrushchev.<br> Licking his ass.<br> An inspired act of God should happen here<br> and put a Texan in the White House!<br> The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.<br> He started in on Kennedy again.<br> I will kill! In the White House!<br> Stab him in the heart!<br> Somebody must get rid of him!<br> You won't get that son of a bitch!<br> It won't be long.<br> That fucker will get what he deserves.<br> It could be blamed on Castro,<br> the country will want to invade Cuba.<br> We just need to get him in the open.<br> Always some harebrained scheme.<br> Let's have some more champagne,<br> shall we?<br> What about the Secret Service? The cops?<br> If it's planned right, no problem.<br> They got close to De Gaulle.<br> Eisenhower always rode in open top.<br> We need three mechanics<br> in three different locations.<br> An office building, a high-powered rifle.<br> Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.<br> That's the key.<br> A diversionary shot<br> gets the Secret Service looking one way.<br> Boom! Get the kill shot.<br> One man has to be sacrificed.<br> In the commotion, the job gets done.<br> The others leave the country.<br> Let's drop this subject.<br> It's one thing to banter with these kids...<br> ...but this sort of thing could be<br> so easily misunderstood.<br> I didn't think much about it then.<br> It's just bullshit.<br> People like to act more important<br> than they are.<br> Especially in the homosexual underworld.<br> But when they got him...<br> ...I got scared.<br> Real scared.<br> That's when I got popped.<br> The things you said will be attacked<br> by many people.<br> Bring them on. Bring their college degrees<br> in here, I got nothing to hide.<br> No one can buy me.<br> - I don't even need this parole.<br> - What parole?<br> You liberal, you don't know shit<br> 'cause you never been fucked in the ass.<br> This ain't about justice!<br> No, this is about order!<br> Who rules? Fascism is coming back.<br> Nobody wants to buy you.<br> No one's promising you parole.<br> What I need to know<br> is why are you telling us this.<br> 'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...<br> ...stole that motherfucking election,<br> that's why.<br> Nixon was going to be a great President<br> until Kennedy wrecked this country.<br> Niggers wanting rights!<br> Why do you think we have all this crime.<br> He promised those motherfuckers<br> too much!<br> Revolution's coming, bullshit!<br> Fascism's coming back!<br> The day that Communist son of a bitch<br> died was a great day!<br> A great day for this country.<br> I hate to think they blame it<br> on silly, fucking Oswald.<br> Didn't know shit, anyway.<br> People got to know.<br> People got to know why he was killed.<br> Because he was a Communist.<br> You go ahead, put me on the stand,<br> I'll tell the same goddamned story!<br> Don't matter to me!<br> All right, Willie. Thanks.<br> We'll be in touch.<br> All right.<br> You know, you're not a bad-looking man.<br> Not bad at all.<br> I get out of here, I'll come see you.<br> We can have fun!<br> Their testimony won't hold up in court.<br> Their reputations are lower<br> than crocodile piss.<br> That bothers you?<br> If a woman's a prostitute,<br> must she also have bad eyesight?<br> Find Clay Bertrand.<br> Start by checking around the Quarter.<br> The six of us,<br> with almost no budget and in secret...<br> ...will solve a case<br> the Warren Commission couldn't?<br> - I didn't pick you for your legal skill.<br> - Thanks, Boss.<br> You're a fighter.<br> I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.<br> Mr. Garrison, how are you?<br> Remember me?<br> You vote for me?<br> I did. We sang together<br> at the Royal Orleans, remember?<br> We sang:<br> "You're the cream in my coffee"<br> Haven't seen you much lately.<br> Been too busy. Elected men can't have<br> as much fun as they used to.<br> It's always nice to see you.<br> Pleasure to serve you always.<br> How are you? Nice to see you.<br> Welcome back, Lou.<br> - Think I could get a martini?<br> - They're waiting for you, sir.<br> Keep that table open for us.<br> Anything on the hoboes?<br> Dallas Times Herald photographer<br> got great shots.<br> Never published.<br> Can't say that comes as a surprise.<br> They took them to the sheriff's<br> and let them go. No record of questioning.<br> Do they look like the hoboes<br> you remember?<br> These two look young.<br> Not a frayed collar or cuff,<br> fresh haircuts and shaves...<br> - ... clean hands, new shoe leather.<br> - Who the hell are they then?<br> Sit down.<br> This could be it. Let's look for them.<br> What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,<br> who saw the men at the picket fence?<br> Graveyard. Dead. August this year.<br> Single-car accident on an empty road<br> in Midlothian, Texas.<br> The doctor said he was in a strange shock<br> when he died.<br> We need to find more witnesses.<br> There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.<br> She said she was a dope runner<br> for Jack Ruby.<br> And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.<br> - Can we talk to her?<br> - She's dead too.<br> Hit and run.<br> Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?<br> Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell<br> for three years. Maybe he'll crack.<br> Can't. If I go to him our investigation<br> will hit the front pages.<br> It'll blow up in our face.<br> Susie, what did you find on Oswald?<br> Negative on his tax records. Classified.<br> First time a DA can't get a tax record.<br> I asked for the CIA files on Oswald<br> that were part of the Warren Report.<br> About 1,200 documents.<br> Can't get one of them.<br> All classified as secret on the grounds<br> of national security.<br> Gave me his grammar school records.<br> It's a study of his pubic hairs.<br> Lonely kid, no father.<br> Joins the Marines at 17.<br> Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.<br> But he's stationed<br> at a top-secret air base in Japan...<br> ...where U-2 spy flights<br> over Russia originate.<br> He's discharged...<br> ...supposedly because his mother's sick.<br> Stays home three days.<br> Then, with a $1,500 ticket from<br> a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.<br> Mr. Oswald, do you understand...<br> - ... the action you are about to take?<br> - Yes, I do, sir.<br> I wish to renounce my citizenship...<br> ...and become a Soviet citizen.<br> I'll give them all the information<br> I have on the Marines.<br> He disappears for six weeks,<br> presumably with the KGB.<br> He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...<br> ...where he lives as high on the hog<br> as he ever has.<br> He's given 5,000 rubles,<br> a roomy apartment with a balcony.<br> Has affairs with local girls.<br> Makes sense. He's a spokesman.<br> But he never does any propaganda<br> for the Russians.<br> He meets Marina.<br> Her uncle is a colonel<br> in Soviet intelligence.<br> She thinks he's Russian by his speech.<br> Six weeks later they marry,<br> have a daughter.<br> Only explanation for the royal treatment<br> is he gave them radar secrets.<br> Or fake secrets.<br> Six months after he's in Russia...<br> ...Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight<br> goes down...<br> ...in Russia. That plane was untouchable.<br> Powers hinted that Oswald...<br> ...could've given the Russians<br> enough data to hit it.<br> As a result, the peace summit between<br> Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.<br> Perhaps our military didn't want<br> the conference to happen?<br> Maybe Oswald was part of that!<br> - Stick to what you can prove in court.<br> - You want facts?<br> Don't get sidetracked.<br> How'd he get back to the States?<br> Does he have any problems<br> with Uncle Sam?<br> No. The State Department issues him<br> a new passport in 48 hours...<br> ...and loans him travel money.<br> He's never investigated or charged<br> for revealing classified information...<br> ...or, as far as we know,<br> debriefed by the CIA.<br> Bastard should've been prosecuted<br> as a traitor when he got off the boat.<br> Did Marina have problems getting out?<br> None, though it's almost impossible<br> to get Russian sweethearts out.<br> This is a man who defected once already.<br> It's crazy. Ordinary people...<br> ...get blacklisted<br> for having leftist affiliations.<br> Doesn't add up.<br> Next thing, he's living in<br> Dallas-Fort Worth, October '62...<br> ...working six months<br> at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall...<br> ...a photographic firm that makes maps<br> for the US Army.<br> Oswald becomes chummy<br> with the Dallas White Russian community.<br> All rabid anti-Communists.<br> It's odd.<br> His closest friend is an oilman,<br> named George DeMohrenschildt.<br> He is 35 years older than Oswald,<br> who is only 23 and supposedly broke.<br> He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,<br> speaks five languages...<br> ...and was a French Vichy intelligence<br> during the war...<br> ...also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.<br> DeMohrenschildt draws a picture<br> of Oswald as an intellectual...<br> ...well read, speaks excellent Russian,<br> a man who adored JFK.<br> I think he's made some mistakes<br> regarding Cuba.<br> I think he's doing a pretty good job.<br> If he succeeds, in my opinion...<br> ...I think he'd make a great President<br> and a handsome one, too.<br> That's scenery, Susie.<br> Now, don't get sidetracked.<br> This is the same man that nailed Oswald<br> to the Warren Commission...<br> ...as a potentially violent man<br> and linked him to the rifle.<br> Well, in that sense<br> Castro is an experimenter.<br> It could go any way with that country.<br> - It could go the way of the communism-<br> - What you got there?<br> Do you have rifles in there?<br> Tell me what I'm shooting at,<br> rabbits or Fascists?<br> - I hunt.<br> - You hunt?<br> We don't know he's CIA.<br> Let's circle him very probable.<br> Call him Oswald's handler.<br> The Oswalds are introduced<br> to Janet and Bill Williams.<br> It's through Janet Williams,<br> in October '63, that Lee gets the job...<br> ...at the warehouse on Elm Street<br> at the Book Depository.<br> So he can now exercise his intellect,<br> stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.<br> Marina fights with Lee about many things.<br> His secrecy, their lack of money.<br> She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.<br> Lee hits her on several occasions.<br> At the age of 24...<br> ...he rents a room in Dallas<br> under the alias of O.H. Lee.<br> Do you want to watch TV?<br> Are you all right?<br> No, thank you. I'm fine.<br> All I know about the Williams is<br> their tax returns are classified.<br> Bill Williams has links to the CIA<br> through his family...<br> ...and does classified work<br> for Bell Helicopter.<br> Bill's convenient separation from Janet<br> allows Marina to move into her house...<br> ...where she suddenly becomes<br> Marina's best friend.<br> There Marina and Lee<br> have a second daughter.<br> I have to go away. Just for a short while.<br> What's wrong with this family?<br> I love Lee...<br> ...and I sorry him.<br> Sorry for him?<br> Yes.<br> When he's arrested,<br> Marina buries him with the public.<br> She describes him as a psychotic<br> and violent man.<br> I have too much facts...<br> ...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.<br> After being locked away<br> by the feds for two months...<br> ...and afraid she'd be deported...<br> ...she was probably suffering<br> from nervous exhaustion.<br> They taught her how to answer.<br> When they think she's ready,<br> they buy her dresses...<br> ...polish her appearance and wheel her out.<br> - I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.<br> - Oswald was no angel.<br> But who was he?<br> I'm lost. What are we saying?<br> That when Oswald went to Russia,<br> he was not a real defector.<br> He was an intelligence agent for our<br> government and remained one till he died.<br> So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...<br> ...the intelligence community<br> murdered the President?<br> I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...<br> ...didn't pull the trigger.<br> Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired<br> a rifle on November 22.<br> And they didn't bother to see<br> if the rifle'd been fired that day.<br> - His palm print was on it.<br> - It went to the FBl.<br> FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.<br> It comes back a week later and a Dallas<br> policeman suddenly finds a palm print?<br> It could've been taken at the morgue.<br> There's no chain of evidence.<br> I can't figure out why he orders<br> a traceable weapon...<br> ...to a P.O. box, when he can go<br> into any store in Texas...<br> ...give a phony name and walk out<br> with an untraceable rifle.<br> To frame him, obviously!<br> A lot of smoke, but some fire.<br> We're talking about our government!<br> We're talking about a crime.<br> You must think on a different level,<br> like the CIA does.<br> We're through the looking glass.<br> White is black.<br> And black is white.<br> Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.<br> A patsy.<br> Unbelievable. You were here?<br> Yes, this is where I was sitting.<br> Shots came from near the wooden fence<br> over there...<br> ...near the overpass.<br> I saw a man run from the fence<br> toward those railroad cars.<br> I made it clear to the Warren people.<br> One of the shots came<br> from behind that picket fence.<br> I heard the report and saw smoke,<br> six or eight feet above the ground.<br> Out from under those trees.<br> All four of us railroad men...<br> ...seen the same thing.<br> The smoke came from behind the hedge.<br> I was standing next to Mary Moorman,<br> who took the photo when he was killed.<br> I stepped down to the curb and yelled:<br> "Mr. President, look over here! "<br> Then shots rang out.<br> Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,<br> "They're shooting! Get down! "<br> I just stood there watching.<br> The driver had stopped.<br> I don't know what was wrong with him.<br> Out of the corner of my eye...<br> ...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.<br> And that last shot...<br> ...just ripped his head off.<br> I looked up and saw smoke coming<br> from over there, on the knoll.<br> We came around to look for tracks.<br> It rained that morning<br> and we found a bunch.<br> Cigarette butts.<br> Someone had stood about... here.<br> That's a good spot.<br> For the head shot.<br> Everything was just frozen.<br> Like people weren't breathing.<br> Like you were looking at a picture.<br> Except for one man.<br> I saw this one man running<br> from the corner of the Book Depository...<br> ...to the parking lot.<br> It was about 11:00 a. m.<br> I was driving on Elm Street<br> toward the underpass in a rented car.<br> A light-blue Valiant.<br> I'll never forget that day.<br> There was a lot of traffic...<br> ...and I stopped<br> alongside a green pickup truck.<br> It was very noticeable<br> because it had one wheel up on the curb.<br> When I saw the gun, I thought...<br> ..."The Secret Service is not very secret. "<br> The next morning, I went to the FBI office.<br> They showed me some pictures.<br> And I picked out three pictures<br> that looked like the truck's driver.<br> That's the man.<br> You mean you identified Jack Ruby<br> on Saturday?<br> That's right.<br> The day before he shot Oswald?<br> That's right. When I saw him on TV,<br> I was shocked.<br> I said to my family,<br> "That's the man I saw in the truck. "<br> You weren't so sure in your statement<br> to the Commission.<br> What about these others?<br> You said one might be him?<br> They look a bit like him,<br> but I'm sure this is the man.<br> It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.<br> I thought maybe our guys had shot back<br> and got one of them.<br> I got to the parking lot.<br> All I saw were the railroad workers<br> and Dallas' finest.<br> - Secret Service. Come with us.<br> - No! Find the shooter!<br> I want your pictures.<br> Son of a bitch!<br> He put a hurt on me, but good.<br> They must've seen everything because<br> they knew what we had done all day.<br> I wasn't hard to find,<br> wearing that red raincoat.<br> - How many shots did you hear?<br> - Four to six.<br> Impossible!<br> You heard echoes!<br> We have three bullets and three shots<br> that came from the Book Depository.<br> - That's all we'll say.<br> - No, sir.<br> I saw a man shooting from behind<br> that fence. What are you going to do?<br> - You go out there and get him!<br> - That's taken care of!<br> You only heard three shots,<br> and don't discuss this with anyone.<br> No one. Understand?<br> Which is strange 'cause it's less<br> than 20 minutes after the assassination.<br> Get her out of here.<br> I knew something was crooked<br> as a dog's hind leg.<br> When I read my testimony<br> in the Warren Report...<br> ...it was a total fabrication.<br> That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.<br> They've altered my statements.<br> This one says:<br> "Mercer couldn't identify any photograph<br> as being the man she observed...<br> "... slouched over the wheel<br> of the green truck. " Not true.<br> I recognized him and I told them so.<br> Take your time.<br> I'm sure.<br> And the sheriff's report...<br> This is really strange.<br> See that notarized signature?<br> That's not mine.<br> There wasn't any notary present<br> during my questioning.<br> Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man...<br> ...it's difficult to accept this.<br> Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison<br> about the Carousel Club.<br> I used to go there to see Jack<br> and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.<br> It was a real swinging spot in town.<br> Everybody came.<br> Businessmen, politicians from Austin,<br> LBJ's friends-<br> Dallas was a slowpokin' town then.<br> You chewed toothpicks, played dominoes,<br> spit, dated policemen.<br> But Jack was exciting.<br> There were always cops there.<br> Jack liked them around, even though<br> he threw out the drunks himself.<br> He had a violent temper.<br> Everyone in those days<br> knew Jack was in the mob.<br> Cops back then, they were bad.<br> They'd shake you down<br> for the money in your pocket.<br> What about Lee?<br> One time I came in.<br> Jack introduced me to two guys.<br> He says, "This is my friend, Lee... "<br> I don't remember the other guy's name.<br> He was a weird-looking guy.<br> He had these eyebrows.<br> And he looked like a buzzard.<br> Lee didn't make much of an impression.<br> He wasn't very handsome.<br> He didn't look like he had any money,<br> and he was in a bad mood.<br> So, I didn't pay him much mind.<br> I may not remember a name,<br> but I always remember a face.<br> Later, when I saw him on television...<br> ...I screamed, "My God, that's him!<br> "That's Jack's friend! "<br> Will you testify, Beverly?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - I thought we had an agreement.<br> - I don't want to be another statistic.<br> - We could call you in.<br> If they can kill the President<br> of the United States...<br> ...you think they'll think twice<br> about a two-bit showgirl like me?<br> I understand the pressure you're under.<br> Don't think that I don't.<br> We both do.<br> Mr. Chief Justice, do you understand<br> that I can't tell the truth in Dallas?<br> There are people here who do not want me<br> to tell the truth.<br> Who don't want me to have a retrial.<br> Why don't you just tell us now?<br> My life is in danger!<br> If you request that I go to Washington...<br> That is, if you want to hear<br> further testimony from me.<br> Can you take me with you?<br> No. It can't be done.<br> There would be no safe place for you.<br> We're not law-enforcement officers.<br> There's a great deal<br> at stake in this matter.<br> If I'm eliminated...<br> ...there won't be any way of knowing<br> any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.<br> Consequently, a whole new form<br> of government will take over.<br> And I won't live to see you<br> some other time.<br> I want to tell the truth.<br> And then...<br> ...leave this world.<br> The Zapruder film establishes<br> three shots in 5.6 seconds.<br> I'm Oswald.<br> Time me.<br> Go.<br> Time?<br> Between six and seven seconds.<br> Without really aiming.<br> The second and third shots came<br> almost right on top of each other.<br> It takes a minimum of...<br> ...2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.<br> The other problem is, there was a tree...<br> ...blocking the first two shots<br> when fired in the Zapruder film.<br> Didn't Hoover say something<br> about leaves falling in November?<br> It was Texas live oak, Chief.<br> It sheds its leaves in early March.<br> Take this Carcano,<br> world's worst shoulder weapon...<br> ...and try to hit a moving target<br> at 88 yards through heavy foliage.<br> No way.<br> FBI tried two sets of tests.<br> Not one sharpshooter could match<br> Oswald's performance.<br> Not one.<br> Oswald was at best a medium shot.<br> The scope was defective on it too.<br> This is the whole essence<br> of the case to me.<br> The guy couldn't do the shooting.<br> Nobody could.<br> They sold this lemon<br> to the American public.<br> The Zapruder film was the proof<br> they didn't count on.<br> We must get hold of it.<br> It means we'll have to subpoena Time-Life.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?<br> Plenty of time.<br> - He's out in the open.<br> - I keep asking myself the same thing.<br> - Frontal shot.<br> - Even if you miss him once...<br> ...if he accelerates, you get a second shot.<br> The only reason to get him on Elm...<br> ...is you got him in a<br> triangulated crossfire.<br> You put a team there down at the fence.<br> Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.<br> Put a third team down in this building...<br> ...on a low floor.<br> When Kennedy gets in the kill zone,<br> it's a turkey shoot.<br> How many men?<br> One shooter. One spotter on a radio.<br> Maybe three teams.<br> These are professional riflemen.<br> Serious people.<br> Hunters.<br> Patient.<br> It takes skill to kill with a rifle.<br> That's why no chief executive's<br> been executed with one in 200 years.<br> Three...<br> ...two...<br> ...one.<br> Main Street's over there.<br> Original parade route on the way<br> to the Trade Mart...<br> ...is too far, right?<br> Too far.<br> Impossible shot,<br> so they change the parade route.<br> Bring him down here.<br> Moving at a normal 25 mph.<br> They knew the motorcade would have<br> to slow down to about 10 mph...<br> ...to make that turn there.<br> And that's where they got him.<br> Who do you think changed<br> the parade route?<br> Beats me. Secret Service,<br> city officials, Dallas Police.<br> You know who was the mayor at the time?<br> Roy Cabell.<br> - Guess who his brother is?<br> - Who?<br> General Charles Cabell.<br> Deputy director of the CIA.<br> Kennedy fired him in '61<br> because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.<br> Moved back to the Pentagon<br> and called Kennedy a traitor.<br> When he came to New Orleans...<br> ...to address the Foreign Policy<br> Association, know who introduced him?<br> Our friend, Clay Shaw.<br> Didn't the Warren Commission call him?<br> His boss was the one<br> on the Warren Commission...<br> ...who handled the leads<br> in the intelligence community.<br> - Allen Dulles?<br> - Head of the CIA since '53.<br> Kennedy fired them both.<br> Cabell was his Deputy for nine years.<br> Talk about the fox investigating<br> the chicken coop.<br> Now, we'll have to subpoena them both.<br> Clay Bertrand? Sure, I know him.<br> Comes to the Quarter.<br> Who is he? I've been to all the bars.<br> Nobody wants to talk.<br> Why should they talk to you?<br> I told your uncle, I never met a lawman<br> who wasn't a punk.<br> A big-shot businessman.<br> I seen him on the TV news...<br> ...with all the other big shots.<br> The guy's a fag, you know?<br> Goes by another name.<br> What name?<br> Shaw.<br> Clay Shaw.<br> Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?<br> Guy who ran the International Trade Mart?<br> What's the mystery?<br> Everybody down here knows him.<br> Then why does he call himself Bertrand?<br> Who gives a shit what he calls himself?<br> Will you give us a little help<br> on that grand jury thing?<br> I hope so. We could use it.<br> Your hunch was right, Boss.<br> But it's even spookier than we thought.<br> Starting in September '63 on,<br> two months before the assassination...<br> ...there are sightings of Oswald<br> all over Dallas.<br> Buying ammunition,<br> getting a telescopic sight fixed.<br> Going to rifle ranges.<br> Early November,<br> at a downtown Dallas Lincoln dealership...<br> - ... he tells the salesman:<br> - Let's take it over for a test drive.<br> Despite the fact he has no license,<br> and doesn't know how to drive...<br> ...he hits the curves like A.J. Foyt<br> at the Indy 500.<br> Beauregard later told his boss<br> that he drove like a madman.<br> $300 down now, Mr. Oswald,<br> you can drive out of here.<br> What? For this heap?<br> No honest working man can afford to buy<br> a car in this goddamn country anymore.<br> Maybe I'll go to Russia and buy one.<br> Really dumb dialogue like he's trying<br> to draw attention to himself.<br> Salesman remembers him as about 5'7",<br> but his draft card says he's actually 5'11".<br> Other witnesses see him on several<br> separate days at different firing ranges.<br> One time, November 9...<br> ...he decides to practice<br> on the next guy's target.<br> I didn't pay for a target<br> just to have you shoot at it!<br> I'm sorry, buddy.<br> I thought I was shooting<br> at that son of a bitch Kennedy.<br> As subtle as a cockroach<br> crawling across a white rug.<br> Then he shows up at Sylvia Odio's...<br> ...a Cuban lady in Dallas<br> in the anti-Castro underground.<br> The two Cubans introduce him<br> as Leon Oswald.<br> Something about the man bothers her.<br> What did you think of me<br> and Oswald last night?<br> I don't care about Oswald.<br> You know what he said to us?<br> "Cubans don't have guts, 'cause Kennedy...<br> "... should have been killed<br> after the Bay of Pigs by a Cuban. "<br> It's like he's giving her information<br> she doesn't even ask for.<br> She's scared and doesn't see him again...<br> ...till she sees Oswald's picture<br> in the paper.<br> But the Warren Commission<br> says that Sylvia...<br> ...has bad eyesight because<br> they have Oswald in Mexico...<br> ...trying to get back into Cuba.<br> The CIA has a camera<br> outside the Cuban Embassy.<br> And they say that this...<br> ...is Oswald in Mexico.<br> If this is Oswald,<br> it must be our third Oswald.<br> The Warren Commission made great efforts<br> to make him a Communist.<br> I think the point of the Mexican episode<br> was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.<br> If Oswald, or someone purporting<br> to be Oswald...<br> ...had gotten into Cuba, come back,<br> and then killed the President...<br> ...the American public would've supported<br> a Cuban invasion.<br> I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.<br> This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.<br> But Oswald told Capt. Fritz<br> that the photo was a fake.<br> This is not me!<br> - That came from Janet Williams' garage.<br> - I never saw this picture.<br> It's my face but it's superimposed.<br> The rest is not me.<br> I know photographic work.<br> That picture was made by someone else!<br> I took this picture to two experts.<br> Look at how the shadows on the nose...<br> ...fall in a straight line,<br> like it's high noon.<br> But the shadow on the ground is more<br> like late afternoon or early morning.<br> It's not the same time.<br> And see the crop marks across the chin?<br> This head is pasted onto another body.<br> Implicating him with the rifle and the gun.<br> Who the hell are you?<br> Alex Hidell or Lee Oswald?<br> You're the policeman, you work it out.<br> Now it gets positively spooky.<br> In January 1961, in New Orleans,<br> at the Bolton Ford dealership...<br> ...when the Oswald we know is in Russia...<br> ...there is a man using the name of Oswald<br> to buy trucks...<br> ...for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.<br> Salesman never sees him again.<br> But who's on the Articles Of Incorporation<br> of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?<br> Guy Banister.<br> Banister has someone using<br> the name Oswald to buy the trucks.<br> Hoover at the FBI has a memo<br> dated June of 1960...<br> ...that someone may be using<br> Oswald's passport and identity.<br> They created Oswald from day one.<br> Like a dummy corporation in the Bahamas.<br> Just move him around a board.<br> Anybody want to quit?<br> Dumb question. Put your hands down.<br> I found Clay Bertrand.<br> Grab your socks and hose and pull.<br> Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw.<br> - Director of the Trade Mart?<br> - Former director.<br> Incredible.<br> Can you get some sworn statements?<br> That'll be tough. Nobody's talking.<br> Let's have him in for a chat.<br> I hate to get him dragged into this.<br> He's done so much for the city,<br> restoring the Quarter.<br> Remember, we saw him at a fund-raiser.<br> Seems like such a nice man.<br> It'll be off the record.<br> I'll bring him in on a Sunday.<br> A quiet little chat between gentlemen.<br> In heavy fighting in Vietnam today...<br> ...seven more American soldiers died<br> and 23 wounded.<br> The body count for this week<br> now stands at 67 Americans...<br> ...and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action.<br> President Johnson said he regretted<br> there's no end in sight to the war...<br> ...where 500,000 US troops<br> are now fighting.<br> We face more cost...<br> ...more loss...<br> ...and more agony.<br> Come hunt for Easter eggs.<br> That's the kids' job. You know I don't like<br> these tribal rituals, anyway.<br> I'm talking to Clay Shaw this morning.<br> We're going to Antoine's with the kids!<br> I told you I was talking to Shaw.<br> In the middle of Easter Sunday?<br> When I scheduled it,<br> I didn't know it was a holiday.<br> Look at the calendar!<br> You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.<br> Clay Shaw is important.<br> - And we're not.<br> - I didn't say that.<br> I didn't say that.<br> You're missing most of your life<br> and you don't know it.<br> The kids are missing out, too.<br> - You're not the only one making sacrifices.<br> - I'll be there by 2:00, I promise.<br> Just start without me.<br> Mr. Garrison, what can I do for you<br> on Easter Sunday?<br> I'm sorry to interrupt this holiday.<br> But this conversation is best kept out<br> of the everyday bustle of this office.<br> I don't understand.<br> In an investigation we're conducting,<br> your name keeps coming up.<br> Can't imagine where.<br> We've talked to a number of men<br> who claim to know you.<br> Do you know a David Logan?<br> No. Never heard of him.<br> Perry Russo?<br> No.<br> Willie O'Keefe?<br> I don't know anyone by that name.<br> Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you<br> at the Masquerade Bar in the Quarter.<br> Then you had him over for dinner<br> at your apartment on Dauphine Street.<br> - Do you recall that?<br> - I don't know this man.<br> Be still my heart.<br> Obviously, I wouldn't have him over.<br> Hope you like squab.<br> Champagne?<br> Perhaps a few more details about<br> the evening will refresh your memory.<br> Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served<br> by a uniformed waiter, a colored man.<br> You sat at one end and he at the other,<br> which he found unusual...<br> ...because the table was so long.<br> How was your mousse?<br> Bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?<br> Not at all.<br> But I do have...<br> ...a lovely Chippendale dining table.<br> I often have a friend sit at one end<br> while I sit at the other.<br> It's precisely the point<br> of a long dining table.<br> The splendor of the meal<br> adds to its enjoyment.<br> I imagine a uniformed waiter helps.<br> It adds elegance, for which I confess...<br> ...a weakness now and then.<br> I call him Smedley.<br> His real name's Frankie Jenkins,<br> but it would be so uncouth during dinner...<br> ...to turn toward the kitchen and holler...<br> ..."Frankie! "<br> Where is all this leading to?<br> After dinner, you paid him to have sex.<br> That is absolute nonsense.<br> The Quarter is filled<br> with vivid imaginations, dear Mr. Garrison.<br> Grimy young hoodlums who will say<br> and do anything!<br> Mr. O'Keefe told us...<br> ...David Ferrie came to the house<br> with another young man.<br> - Who?<br> - David Ferrie.<br> I don't know that name.<br> Never having met Mr. O'Keefe,<br> I couldn't have met Mr. Ferrie.<br> You're mine, Mary.<br> The four of you partied early<br> into the morning hours.<br> Look at this picture.<br> I've never met anyone<br> of such bizarre appearance.<br> Only way you get this,<br> you do exactly what I say.

Two wars.<br> A secret Pentagon guy,<br> supplying the hardware:<br> Planes, bullets, rifles...<br> ...for what we call "Black Operations. "<br> Black Ops. Assassinations. Coups d'etat...<br> ...rigging elections,<br> propaganda, psych warfare.<br> In World War ll, I was in Romania,<br> Greece, Yugoslavia.<br> I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence<br> at the end of the war.<br> And we used those guys<br> against the Communists.<br> In Italy, '48, we stole the elections.<br> France '49, we broke the strikes.<br> Overthrew Quirino in the Philippines,<br> Arbenz in Guatemala...<br> ...Mossadegh in Iran.<br> We were in Vietnam in '54...<br> ...Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.<br> Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.<br> Very good.<br> Then we got into the Cuban thing.<br> Not so good.<br> Set up an invasion to take place<br> in October, '62.<br> Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.<br> Kennedy didn't invade.<br> We just had our dicks in the wind.<br> A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.<br> Understand?<br> I'll come to that later.<br> So, 1963...<br> I spent much of September of '63...<br> ...working on the Kennedy plan<br> to get all US personnel...<br> ...out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.<br> One of the strongest plans issued<br> by the Kennedy White House...<br> ...National Security Memo 263...<br> ...ordered home the first 1,000 troops.<br> But in November, a week after the murder<br> of Vietnamese President Diem...<br> ...and two weeks before<br> Kennedy's assassination...<br> ...a strange thing happened to me.<br> Is Dave in there?<br> You wanted to see me, General?<br> I do, indeed.<br> You're going to the South Pole.<br> I am?<br> Dr. Mooney's got the details.<br> Check with him. Have a nice vacation.<br> I was sent by my superior,<br> we'll call him "Y"...<br> ...I was sent by General Y<br> to the South Pole...<br> ...as military escort for a group<br> of international VIPs.<br> I was on my way back, in New Zealand...<br> ...when the President was killed.<br> Oswald was charged at 7:00 p. m,<br> Dallas time...<br> ...with Tippit's murder. That's 2:00 p. m.<br> the next day in New Zealand.<br> But already their papers<br> had the entire history...<br> ...of this unknown, 24-year-old Oswald.<br> Studio picture, detailed biography,<br> Russian information...<br> ...and were sure that he killed<br> the President alone...<br> ...although it took them four more hours<br> to charge him with that crime in Dallas.<br> It felt to me as if...<br> ...a cover story was being put out.<br> Like we would in a Black Op.<br> After I came back...<br> ...I asked myself, why was I,<br> the chief of Special Ops...<br> ...sent to the South Pole to do a job...<br> ...many others could have done?<br> I wondered if it could've been because...<br> ...a routine duty,<br> if I'd been in Washington...<br> ...would've been to order<br> additional security in Texas.<br> I checked it out and found that someone...<br> ...told the 112th Military Intelligence<br> Group at Fort Sam Houston...<br> ...to stand down that day,<br> over the protests of Colonel Reich.<br> I believe it's a mistake.<br> It's standard procedure, especially<br> in a known hostile city like Dallas...<br> ...to supplement the Secret Service.<br> Even if we hadn't let him ride<br> with the bubble-top off...<br> ...we would've put 100 to 200 agents<br> on the sidewalk without question.<br> A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador<br> Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.<br> There had been attempts<br> on De Gaulle's life in France.<br> We'd have arrived days ahead,<br> studied the route...<br> ...checked all buildings.<br> Never would've allowed open windows<br> overlooking Dealey.<br> Our own snipers<br> would've covered the area.<br> If a window went up,<br> they'd have been on the radio!<br> We'd be watching the crowd:<br> packages, rolled-up newspapers, coats.<br> Never would've let a man<br> open an umbrella.<br> Never would've let the car slow down<br> to ten miles an hour.<br> Or take that unusual curve<br> at Houston and Elm.<br> You'd have felt an Army presence<br> in the streets that day.<br> But none of this happened. It violated<br> our most basic protection codes.<br> And it is the best indication<br> of a massive plot in Dallas.<br> Who could have best done this?<br> Black Ops. People in my business.<br> My superior might call Col. Reich and say:<br> "We have another unit coming for security.<br> You'll stand down. "<br> That day, some Army intelligence people<br> were in Dallas.<br> I don't know who or why.<br> But they weren't protecting clients.<br> And Oswald. Army Intell had<br> a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.<br> Those files have been destroyed.<br> Many strange things were happening.<br> Oswald had nothing to do with them.<br> The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.<br> A third of a combat division<br> was returning from Germany...<br> ...in the air above the United States,<br> at the time of the shooting.<br> At 12:34 p. m, the Washington<br> telephone system went out for an hour.<br> On the plane back to Washington...<br> ...word was radioed<br> from the Situations Room...<br> ...to Johnson that there was one assassin.<br> Sound like coincidences to you?<br> Not for one moment.<br> The Cabinet was out of the way.<br> Troops for riot control were in the air.<br> Telephones were out to stop<br> the wrong stories from spreading.<br> Nothing was left to chance.<br> He could not be allowed to escape alive.<br> Things were never the same after that.<br> Vietnam started for real.<br> There was an air of...<br> ...make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.<br> Those of us in Secret Ops knew<br> the Warren Commission was fiction.<br> But there was something...<br> ...deeper.<br> Uglier.<br> I knew Allen Dulles well.<br> I often briefed him in his house.<br> But why was he appointed to investigate<br> Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.<br> Dulles, by the way,<br> was General Y's benefactor.<br> I got out in '64.<br> Resigned my commission.<br> I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous<br> to the establishment.<br> Is that why?<br> That's the real question, isn't it? Why?<br> The how and the who is just scenery<br> for the public.<br> Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia...<br> ...keeps them guessing, like a game.<br> Prevents them from asking<br> the most important question: why?<br> Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?<br> Who has the power to cover it up? Who?<br> In 1961...<br> ...right after the Bay of Pigs,<br> very few people know this...<br> ...I participated in drawing up<br> National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 57.<br> These are documents classified top secret.<br> In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,<br> chairman of the Joint Chiefs...<br> ...that from here on, the Joint Chiefs<br> would be wholly responsible...<br> ...for all covert paramilitary action<br> in peacetime.<br> This ended the reign of the CIA.<br> Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,<br> as JFK promised he would.<br> And now he was ordering the military...<br> ...to help him do it. Unprecedented!<br> I can't tell you the shock waves this sent<br> along the corridors of power.<br> This and the firing of Allen Dulles...<br> ...Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.<br> All were sacred cows in Intell<br> since World War ll.<br> They got some very upset people.<br> Kennedy's directives weren't implemented<br> because of...<br> ...bureaucratic resistance.<br> But one of the results was...<br> ...the Cuban operation was turned over<br> to my department...<br> ...as Operation Mongoose.<br> Mongoose was pure Black Ops.<br> It was secretly based at Miami University...<br> ...which has the largest<br> domestic CIA station...<br> ...budgeted annually for hundreds<br> of millions of dollars.<br> Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.<br> Fifty fake business fronts<br> to launder money.<br> They waged a non-stop war against Castro.<br> Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.<br> All under the control of General Y.<br> He took the rules of covert warfare<br> he'd used abroad...<br> ...and brought them to this country.<br> Now he had the people,<br> the equipment, the bases...<br> ...and the motivation.<br> Don't underestimate the budget cuts<br> that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.<br> Nearly 52 military installations<br> in 25 states.<br> Twenty-one overseas bases.<br> Big money.<br> You know how many helicopters<br> have been lost in Vietnam?<br> Nearly 3,000 so far.<br> Who makes them?<br> Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?<br> Bell was nearly bankrupt when First<br> National Bank of Boston asked the CIA...<br> ...to use the helicopter in Indochina.<br> How about the F-111 fighter?<br> General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.<br> Who owns that?<br> Find out the defense budget since<br> the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.<br> Nearly $200 billion will be spent<br> before it's over.<br> In 1949, it was $10 billion.<br> No war... no money.<br> The organizing principle<br> of any society, Mr. Garrison...<br> ...is for war.<br> The authority of the state over its people<br> resides in its war powers.<br> Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War<br> in his second term.<br> He wanted to call off the moon race<br> and cooperate with the Soviets.<br> He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.<br> He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.<br> He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.<br> But all that ended<br> on the 22nd of November, 1963.<br> Since 1961, they knew Kennedy<br> was not going to war in Southeast Asia.<br> Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.<br> Something's underway, but it has no face.<br> Yet, everybody in the loop knows.<br> Forget about combat troops.<br> He told McNamara he would pull out<br> the goddamn advisors!<br> He fucked us in Laos and now<br> he will fuck us in Vietnam!<br> He can't afford to implement it<br> before the election.<br> I hear the NSC meeting<br> was a real barn burner.<br> I wouldn't have missed it for the world.<br> Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?<br> What?<br> Kennedy rubbed Lem's nose in shit.<br> Said if we didn't go into Cuba,<br> which was so close...<br> ...why go into Vietnam<br> which is so far away?<br> There he goes again.<br> Got his hand on the chicken switch.<br> Lem said that the Chiefs still think<br> we should go into Cuba.<br> Money's at stake.<br> Big money. $100 billion.<br> Kennedy bred voting districts<br> for defense dollars.<br> He gave TFX fighter contracts only<br> to those counties that will matter in '64.<br> The people in the loop fight back.<br> Their way.<br> We have to control the intelligence<br> from Saigon.<br> We just don't let McNamara<br> stick his nose in this thing!<br> Every time he goes over to Saigon<br> for a fact-finding mission...<br> ...he comes back<br> and scares the shit out of Kennedy!<br> Now I want Max Taylor<br> on him night and day...<br> ...like a fly on shit.<br> You control McNamara,<br> you control Kennedy.<br> I think it started like that.<br> In the wind.<br> Defense contractors, oil bankers.<br> Just conversation.<br> A call is made. Maybe to someone<br> like my superior officer General Y.<br> We're going. We need your help.<br> When?<br> In the fall.

Can someone else help you?<br> Special Agent Hosty made three visits<br> to Janet Williams' house...<br> ...to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.<br> Hosty told a newspaperman<br> it was a warning...<br> ...to stop questioning Marina<br> when Oswald was not present.<br> She was not a citizen, so possibly<br> he was threatening to deport her to Russia.<br> But what the note really said,<br> no one knows.<br> Hosty tore it up<br> and flushed it down the toilet.<br> This is just speculation.<br> But what if the note described<br> the assassination attempt on JFK?<br> Come on, think!<br> That's the only reason to destroy it.<br> If it was a threat like Hosty said,<br> they would have kept it.<br> It makes their case against the angry,<br> lone nut that much stronger.<br> Remember the meeting<br> with Agent Quigley...<br> ...the day he was arrested?<br> Quigley destroyed the notes<br> from the interview.<br> We can raise the possibility<br> that Oswald was not only an informant...<br> ...but he may have been the original source<br> for the telex dated November 17...<br> ...warning of Kennedy's assassination<br> in Dallas on November 22.<br> William Walter, the FBI night clerk,<br> gave me a copy.<br> It went all over the country.<br> Nothing was done.<br> The motorcade went ahead on schedule.<br> The Warren Report didn't mention it.<br> "A militant group may attempt<br> to assassinate President Kennedy...<br> "... on his proposed trip<br> to Dallas, Texas. "<br> Shortly after the assassination...<br> ...Walter says the telex was removed<br> from all the files...<br> ...as an obvious embarrassment<br> to the Bureau.<br> I believe Oswald sent information<br> through Hosty.<br> I have a hunch Oswald<br> had infiltrated this group:<br> Cubans or right-wing extremists.<br> He was told to be<br> at the Book Depository that day...<br> ...to either prevent the assassination<br> or take part in it.<br> Either they told him<br> they'd close down the plotters...<br> ...or simulate an attack...<br> ...on Kennedy to whip up public opinion...<br> ...so Kennedy would have to reverse<br> his policies on communism.<br> What they told him doesn't matter.<br> He was under orders.<br> He was a foot soldier.<br> You can't miss. He is a dead duck.<br> I don't buy it.<br> Why would the FBI cover it up?<br> A telex disappears from every FBI office<br> in this country?<br> There's a word, Bill.<br> - Orders.<br> - Or a cover-up.<br> Don't you have enough proof<br> of the FBl's complicity yet?<br> I respect this country's institutions!<br> How the hell can you keep<br> a conspiracy going...<br> ...between the mob, CIA, FBl, Army<br> intelligence and who knows what else...<br> ...when you can't keep a secret<br> in this room between 12 people?<br> I mean, we got leaks everywhere.<br> We are going to trial, y'all!<br> What the hell do we really got?<br> Oswald, Ruby, Banister,<br> and Ferrie are dead.<br> Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.<br> But as a covert operator...<br> ...he is wide open for blackmail<br> because of his homosexuality.<br> Shaw's our toehold.<br> I don't know or care exactly how he fits.<br> But he's lying through his teeth.<br> I won't let go of him.<br> That's why you're going to trial<br> against Clay Shaw?<br> You will lose!<br> We should investigate<br> our Mafia leads here.<br> I can buy that easier<br> than I can the government.<br> Ruby is all mob, knows Oswald,<br> sets him up.<br> Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,<br> they hire some guns and do Kennedy.<br> The government doesn't want<br> to open up a whole can of worms...<br> ...because it used the mob<br> to try to get Castro.<br> Castro being assassinated<br> by the mob by us...<br> ...sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.<br> So they close the book on JFK.<br> Makes perfect sense to me.<br> I don't doubt their involvement<br> at a low level.<br> Could the mob change the parade route?<br> Or eliminate the protection<br> for the President?<br> Could the mob send Oswald to Russia<br> and get him back?<br> Get the FBl, the CIA and the Dallas Police<br> to mess up the investigation?<br> Get the Warren Commission appointed<br> to cover it up?<br> Wreck the autopsy? Influence<br> the national media to go to sleep?<br> Since when has the mob used anything<br> but. 38's for hits up close?<br> The mob wouldn't have the guts or<br> the power for something of this magnitude.<br> Assassins need payrolls...<br> ...schedules, times, orders.<br> This was a military-style ambush.<br> A coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson<br> waiting in the wings.<br> You're saying Lyndon Johnson<br> was involved? The President?<br> Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,<br> Brown and Root...<br> ...to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.<br> Boss, are you calling the President<br> a murderer?<br> If I'm so far from the truth,<br> why is the FBI bugging our offices?<br> Why are witnesses being bought off<br> and murdered?<br> Why are federal agencies blocking<br> our extraditions and subpoenas?<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe there's some rogue element<br> in the government.<br> With a full-blown cover-up?<br> You ever read Shakespeare?<br> I do.<br> Julius Caesar?<br> "Brutus and Cassius,<br> they too are honorable men.

They can't.<br> - The camera can pick these up.<br> - Jim, I'm sorry.<br> They can't. We have libel laws.<br> Those men you just saw were arrested<br> in Dallas minutes after the assassination.<br> They were never seen again.<br> No record of arrest,<br> no mug shots, no fingerprints.<br> Hold that thought.<br> We'll be back,<br> right after these commercials.<br> Bill, what the hell are you doing here?<br> I'm sorry about the other day.<br> I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.<br> You came all this way<br> to tell me the obvious?<br> No. Look...<br> ...I just heard of an attempt to kill you<br> between here and New Orleans.<br> A mob guy was brought down by Shaw<br> from Canada.<br> This is serious.<br> You'll need a bodyguard tonight.<br> When you were in the Army,<br> did you ever find out what an order meant?<br> Do you remember my orders<br> about passing on rumors...<br> ...about someone going to be killed?<br> - Yes, I do, but this is-<br> - No, there is no "but.

Now, sit down!<br> That's the man right there.<br> To prove there was a conspiracy<br> involving Clay Shaw...<br> ...we must prove there was more than<br> one man involved in the assassination.<br> To do that...<br> ...we must look at the Zapruder film<br> which my office subpoenaed.<br> The American public has not seen...<br> ...has not seen the film. It's been locked<br> in a vault the last five years...<br> ...in the Time-Life Building in New York.<br> There's a reason for that.<br> Watch.<br> "The picture speaks 1,000 words.

That's enough.<br> It's duly noted.<br> Let's check the back.<br> I can feel the end of the wound<br> with my finger.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> Watch the ear!<br> Shot in the back. Cheap crime.<br> He said:<br> Who's in charge here?<br> I am.<br> I don't remember his name.<br> It was quite crowded.<br> And when you are called to look<br> at the wounds of the dead President...<br> ...you don't ask people for their names<br> and who they are.<br> But you were a qualified pathologist.<br> Was the Army General?<br> No.<br> But you took his orders.<br> Yes.<br> - So he was directing the autopsy.<br> - No.<br> There were others.<br> There were admirals.<br> When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,<br> you follow orders.<br> It is not our business to discuss this<br> with anyone outside this room.<br> As I recall, Admiral Kenney,<br> Navy Surgeon General...<br> ...specifically told us<br> not to discuss the case.<br> A lot of people were deciding<br> what was private...<br> ...none of the American people's business.<br> The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...<br> ...by his own admission,<br> voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.<br> President Johnson orders<br> the blood-soaked limousine...<br> ...filled with bullet holes and clues<br> to be washed and rebuilt.<br> He sends Connally's bloody suit<br> to the cleaners.<br> The Justice Department denied this office<br> access to the autopsy photos.<br> When we finally get a court order<br> to examine Kennedy's brain...<br> ...in the hopes of finding<br> from which direction the bullet came...<br> ...we're told...<br> ...by your government that<br> the President's brain has disappeared.<br> That's not all that's disappeared.<br> With it, the concept of justice.<br> Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting<br> the federal government-<br> Overruled!<br> So, what really happened that day?<br> Let's just for a moment speculate,<br> shall we?<br> We have the epileptic seizure...<br> ...distracting the police and allowing<br> the shooters to get into place.<br> The epileptic later vanished,<br> never checking into the hospital.<br> The A-team goes to the sixth floor<br> of the Depository.<br> They were refurbishing the floors<br> of the Depository that week...<br> ...allowing unknown workmen<br> in the building.<br> They move quickly into position,<br> minutes before the shooting.<br> The second spotter, talking by radio to<br> the other teams, has the best overall view.<br> The God spot.<br> B- team, one rifleman and one spotter<br> with access to the building...<br> ...moves into a low floor<br> of the Dal-Tex building.<br> The third team, C-team, moves in<br> behind the fence above the grassy knoll...<br> ...where the shooter and the spotter<br> are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.<br> They have the best position.<br> Kennedy is close and on a flat,<br> low trajectory.<br> Part of this team is a coordinator...<br> ...who flashed security credentials<br> at people, chasing them from the area.<br> Probably two to three more men<br> are in the crowd.<br> Ten to twelve men.<br> Three teams. Three shooters.<br> The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and<br> David Ferrie discussed two months before.<br> They blocked the plaza.<br> They know every inch.<br> They've calibrated their sights.<br> Practiced on moving targets.<br> They're ready.<br> Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn<br> from Main onto Houston.<br> It's going to be a turkey shoot.<br> They don't shoot him on Houston...<br> ...the easiest shot for a single shooter<br> in the Depository.<br> They wait till he gets to the killing zone<br> between three rifles.<br> Kennedy makes the turn<br> from Houston onto Elm.<br> Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.<br> The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,<br> taking their aim.<br> Waiting for the radio to say,<br> "Green! Green! "<br> Or, "Abort! Abort! "<br> The first shot rings out.<br> Sounding like a backfire,<br> it misses the car completely.<br> Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving<br> as he hears something.<br> Connally's head turns slightly to the right.<br> Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy<br> in the throat from the front.<br> Frame 225, Kennedy emerges<br> from behind the road sign.<br> He's been hit, raising his hands<br> to his throat.<br> The third shot, frame 232...<br> ...hits Kennedy in the back,<br> pulling him downward and forward.<br> Connally, you will notice,<br> shows no sign of being hit.<br> He is holding his Stetson, which is<br> impossible if his wrist is shattered.<br> Connally is turning now.<br> Frame 238. The fourth shot.<br> It misses Kennedy and takes Connally<br> in the back.<br> This is the shot that proves<br> there were two rifles.<br> Connally yells, "My God!<br> They're going to kill us all! "<br> Around this time,<br> another shot misses the car completely...<br> ...striking James Teague by the underpass.<br> The car brakes.<br> The sixth and fatal shot.<br> Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head<br> from the front.<br> This is the key shot.<br> The President going back and to his left...<br> ...shot from the front and right.<br> Totally inconsistent with the shot<br> from the Depository.<br> Again.<br> Back, and to the left.<br> Back, and to the left.<br> Back, and to the left.<br> So what happens then?<br> Pandemonium.<br> Let's go! We got him!<br> The shooters quickly disassemble their<br> various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.<br> Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot<br> behind the fence.<br> He smells gunpowder.<br> He produced credentials showing him<br> to be Secret Service.<br> Let's see your ID.<br> See anyone else up here?<br> I accepted that and let him go.<br> I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.<br> He had on a sports shirt and pants,<br> but he had dirty fingernails.<br> Afterward, it didn't ring true.<br> But at the time...<br> ...we were so pressed for time.<br> All Secret Servicemen<br> in Dallas are accounted for.<br> None were on foot in Dealey Plaza<br> before or after the shooting...<br> ...till the Dallas Secret Service chief<br> returned at 12:55.<br> The Dallas police took at least 12 people<br> into custody.<br> No record of their arrest.<br> Men acting like hoboes<br> were pulled off trains...<br> ...marched through Dealey Plaza,<br> photographed.<br> Yet there's no record of their arrest.<br> Men identifying themselves<br> as Secret Service agents were everywhere.<br> But who was impersonating them?<br> Where was Oswald?<br> Around 12:15, leaving the building<br> to see the motorcade...<br> ...Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald<br> in the second-floor snack room...<br> ...where he said he went for a Coke.<br> He was in a booth on the right side<br> of the room.<br> He was by himself as usual,<br> appeared to be having lunch.<br> I didn't speak to him,<br> but I recognized him clearly.<br> At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is<br> supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.<br> He's there until 12:15, maybe 12:20.<br> He sees nobody.<br> Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,<br> sees two men in the sixth-floor windows...<br> ...presumably after Williams<br> finished his lunch and left.<br> John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor<br> of the county jail, sees them.<br> Many of us saw them.<br> Everyone was hollering and yelling.<br> We thought they was security guys.<br> If Oswald was the assassin, he was<br> nonchalant about moving into position.<br> Later, he told police he was<br> in the second-floor snack room.<br> Probably told to wait there<br> by his handler for a call.<br> But the phone call never came.<br> Maximum 90 seconds<br> after Kennedy is shot...<br> ...Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald<br> in that second-floor lunchroom.<br> Is this man an employee?<br> Yes. The President's been shot.<br> The Commission would have us believe...<br> ...that after firing three bolt-action shots<br> in 5.6 seconds...<br> ...Oswald then leaves three cartridges<br> neatly side-by-side in the firing nest...<br> ...wipes fingerprints off the rifle,<br> stashes it on the other side of the loft...<br> ...sprints down five flights of stairs...<br> ...past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles<br> who never see him...<br> ...then shows up, cool and calm, on the<br> second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.<br> All this within a maximum of 90 seconds<br> of the shooting.<br> Is this man an employee?<br> Yes. The President's been shot.<br> Is he out of breath?<br> According to Baker, absolutely not.<br> Assuming he is the sole assassin,<br> Oswald is free to leave the building.<br> The longer he delays, the more chance<br> the building will be sealed by police.<br> Is he guilty? Does he walk<br> out the nearest staircase?<br> He buys a Coke...<br> ...and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid<br> on the second floor...<br> ...he strolls out<br> the more distant front exit...<br> ...where cops have gathered.<br> Odd, since three shots were fired<br> from there...<br> ...nobody seals the Depository<br> for ten more minutes.<br> Oswald slips out,<br> as do several other employees.<br> When he realized something had gone<br> wrong and Kennedy had been killed...<br> ...he knew there was a problem.<br> Maybe even that he was the patsy.<br> An intuition, maybe. The President killed<br> in spite of his warning.<br> The phone call that never came.<br> Perhaps fear now came to Oswald<br> for the very first time.<br> Oswald returns to his rooming house<br> around 1:00 p. m...<br> ...a half hour after the assassination.<br> A man shot the President!<br> He puts on his jacket,<br> grabs his. 38 revolver...<br> ...and leaves at 1:04.<br> Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,<br> heard two beeps on a car horn.<br> Two uniformed cops pulled up<br> while Oswald was in his room.<br> Like it was a signal.<br> Officer Tippit is shot between 1:10<br> and 1:15, a mile away.<br> And though no one saw him walking...<br> ...the government says<br> Oswald covered that distance.<br> Giving the government the benefit<br> of the doubt...<br> ...Oswald would've had to jog a mile<br> in six to eleven minutes...<br> ...then commit the murder,<br> reverse his direction...<br> ...and walk three-fifths of a mile<br> to the Texas Theater...<br> ...and arrive sometime before 1:30.<br> It's also a useful conclusion.<br> After all, why would Oswald<br> kill Officer Tippit...<br> ...unless he just shot the President<br> and feared arrest?<br> Domingo Benevides...<br> ...the closest witness to the shooting...<br> ...refused to identify Oswald as the killer<br> and was never taken to a lineup.<br> Acquilla Clemons...<br> ...saw the killer and another man<br> go off in separate directions.<br> Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup<br> or to the Warren Commission.<br> At the scene, Officer Poe marks<br> his initials on the shells...<br> ...to record the chain of evidence.<br> Those initials are not<br> on the three cartridge cases...<br> ...which the Warren Commission show him.<br> As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes<br> after the assassination...<br> ...the police put out a description<br> matching Oswald's size and build.<br> Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,<br> Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.<br> Oswald is scared. He begins to realize<br> the full implications of this thing.<br> He goes to the Texas Theater,<br> possibly a prearranged meeting point.<br> Though he has $14 in his pocket,<br> he doesn't buy the $0.75 ticket.<br> Brewer has the cashier call the police.<br> In response to that call...<br> ...at least 30 officers in patrol cars<br> descend on the movie theater.<br> This is the most remarkable example<br> of police intuition...<br> ...since the Reichstag fire.<br> I don't buy it!<br> They knew. Someone knew<br> Oswald would be there.<br> Brewer leads the cops into the theater...<br> ...and from the stage, points Oswald out.<br> There he is.<br> Sir, can I get you to stand up?<br> I am not resisting arrest!<br> I am not resisting arrest!<br> They have their man.<br> It's already been decided in Washington.<br> When he is brought from the theater...<br> ...a crowd is waiting to scream at him.<br> Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.<br> in Kafka's The Trial.<br> He's never given reasons for his arrest.<br> He doesn't know the unseen forces<br> ranging against him.<br> At police headquarters, he was booked<br> for murdering Tippit.<br> No legal counsel was provided.<br> No record made of the questioning.<br> When the sun rises the next morning...<br> ...he is booked for murdering the President.<br> The whole country, fueled by the media,<br> assumes he is guilty.<br> Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...<br> ...out to spare Jackie Kennedy<br> from testifying at a trial...<br> ...Jack Ruby is let into a garage...<br> ...by one of his inside men<br> on the police force.<br> Oswald is brought out<br> like a sacrificial lamb...<br> ...and nicely disposed of as an enemy<br> of the people.<br> Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...<br> ...buried in a cheap grave<br> under the name Oswald?<br> Nobody.<br> False statements and press leaks<br> about Oswald circulate the globe.<br> The official legend is created<br> and the media takes it from there.<br> The glitter of official lies<br> and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...<br> ...confuse the eye<br> and confound the understanding.<br> Hitler said:<br> "The bigger the lie,<br> the more people will believe it.

Holland...<br> ...Lee Bowers...<br> ...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...<br> ...have all taken that risk<br> and they've all come forward.<br> I have here some $8,000 in these letters...<br> ...sent from all over the country.<br> Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...<br> ...plumbers, car salesmen,<br> teachers, invalids.<br> These are people who cannot afford<br> to send money but do.<br> People who drive cabs...<br> ...who nurse in hospitals...<br> ...who see their kids go to Vietnam.<br> Why?<br> Because they care.<br> Because they want to know the truth.<br> Because they want their country back.<br> Because it still belongs to us...<br> ...as long as the people have the guts<br> to fight for what they believe in.<br> The truth is the most important value<br> we have, because if it doesn't endure...<br> ...if the government murders truth...<br> ...if we cannot respect these people...<br> ...then this is not the country I was<br> born in, or the country I want to die in.<br> Tennyson wrote:<br> "Authority forgets a dying king. "<br> This was never more true<br> than for John F. Kennedy...<br> ...whose murder was probably one<br> of the most terrible moments...<br> ...in the history of our country.<br> We, the people, the jury system sitting<br> in judgment on Clay Shaw...<br> ...represent the hope...<br> ...of humanity against government power.<br> In discharging your duty...<br> ...to bring a first conviction<br> in this house of cards...<br> ...against Clay Shaw...<br> "... ask not what your country can do for<br> you but what you can do for your country. "<br> Do not forget...<br> ...your dying king.<br> Show this world...<br> ...this is still a government "of the people,<br> for the people and by the people. "<br> Nothing as long as you live...<br> ...will ever be more important.<br> It's up to you.<br> Has the jury reached a verdict?<br> We have, Your Honor.<br> Please hand the verdict to the clerk.<br> Will the defendant please rise?<br> The clerk will now read the verdict.<br> "New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969.<br> "We, the jury, find the defendant,<br> Clay Shaw, not guilty. "<br> We believe there was a conspiracy.<br> Whether Shaw was a part of it<br> is another kettle of fish.<br> There's Jim!<br> Do you agree that this is a full vindication<br> of the Warren Commission?<br> It only proves you cannot run<br> an investigation...<br> ...questioning the intelligence operations<br> of the US government.<br> People claim you're unfit to hold office...<br> ...that you've ruined<br> Clay Shaw's reputation.<br> Are you going to resign?<br> Hell, no! I'm going to run again,<br> and I'm going to win!<br> Who will you persecute next?<br> If it takes me 30 years to nail every one<br> of the assassins...<br> ...then I will continue for 30 years!<br> I owe that to Jack Kennedy<br> and the country.<br> There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!<br> - How does it feel to be acquitted?<br> - It's been exhausting.<br> What'll you do now?<br> I'm going home and cook some touffe.<br> Were you confident about the outcome?<br> - Do you think Garrison will be back?<br> - I'm sure he will.<br>
