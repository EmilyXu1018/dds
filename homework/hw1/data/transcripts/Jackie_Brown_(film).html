No?<br> Because he knows you.<br> Well, he knew you.<br> He doesn't know anybody now.<br> He's dead.<br> They found him in a trunk<br> of a car this morning,<br> shot twice.<br> Once in the chest,<br> once in the head.<br> Here you go.<br> So I guess I'm wondering.<br> If you don't know Beaumont,<br> why do you suppose Beaumont<br> knows you?<br> Look, Miss Brown,<br> we don't give a fuck about you.<br> You know who we want.<br> If you cooperate, tell us what we want<br> to know, we'll help you get out of this.<br> If you refuse to cooperate,<br> continue to cop a shit attitude<br> like you're doing now,<br> we will give you to Customs<br> and they will take you to court.<br> With your prior, thejudge<br> will give you two years.<br> Now, you'll probably only end up<br> serving a year and some change,<br> but if I was<br> a 44-year-old black woman...<br> desperately clinging on to this<br> one shitty, little job I was<br> fortunate enough to get,<br> I don't think that I'd think<br> I had a year to throw away.<br> So let's start again now,<br> shall we?<br> Who in Mexico gave you this money, and<br> who in America were you bringing it to?<br> I'm not sayin'<br> another goddamn word.<br> I'd like your permission<br> to look through this again so<br> we'll know how much we're talking about.<br> Sure.

Varga.<br> - Dargas, Your Honor.<br> - Sorry.<br> Uh, you were the arresting officer<br> in this case?<br> - That's correct, Your Honor.<br> - And do you have a bail recommendation?<br> - Yes, I do, Your Honor.<br> - And that would be?<br> Based on the defendant's<br> prior conviction...<br> and the extreme possibility of flight<br> due to the occupation,<br> the state requests a bond<br> of no less than 25,000.<br> You people are fine with this?<br> I'm gonna set bond<br> at 10,000...<br> and set the date<br> of August 21...<br> for the prelim.<br> Your Honor,<br> when will that be?<br> That's six weeks from now.<br> We'll continue this matter then.<br> Owens, case 72242.<br> The charge is possession<br> of a concealed weapon...<br> and striking an officer.<br> - How does your client plead?<br> - I thought it'd be 25.<br> Uh, my client<br> would like to plead guilty, Your Honor.<br> Is the arresting officer<br> here in the courtroom?<br> Uh-uh-uh.

Yeah.<br> Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'<br> that shit "possession with intent".<br> A 44-year-old black woman<br> caught with less than two ounces,<br> they calling that shit "intent".<br> The same thing happen to a movie star,<br> they call it "possession".<br> Still sounds high.<br> Well, um, she had on her,<br> I believe it was 50 grand in cash.<br> All right, before we start<br> talking about stewardesses,<br> let's get Beaumont<br> out of the way first.<br> You know, I think<br> somebody already did.<br> - What?<br> - You ain't hear?<br> - Hear what?<br> - Somebody with a grudge<br> blew Beaumont's brains out.<br> Oh, shit.<br> That shit rhymes.<br> Blew Beaumont's<br> brains out.<br> Police make contact<br> with you?<br> Oh, hell, yeah.<br> First motherfucking thing they did.<br> You know, they see I pay<br> a big money bond for my boy,<br> they start thinking that "where there's<br> smoke there's fire" logic.<br> Rousted my ass out of bed<br> Scared the shit out<br> of my woman Sheronda.<br> She thought they was gonna<br> take my ass away for sure.<br> - This stewardess...<br> You know her last name?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Brown.<br> Jackie Brown.<br> - What does she do for you?<br> - Who said she do anything for me?<br> She's my friend. My friends get<br> in trouble, I like to help them out.<br> Beaumont worked for you.<br> This you and me talking,<br> like lawyer-client thing?<br> You can't tell nothing<br> I say to you?<br> You're not my client till you<br> get busted and I bond you out.<br> Well, we ain't got no, uh...<br> What you call that shit?<br> Confidentiality.<br> Why should I<br> tell you anything?<br> 'Cause you want me to know<br> what a slick guy you are.<br> You got stewardesses<br> bringing you 50 grand.<br> And why would a stewardess<br> be bringing me 50 grand?<br> Now you want me to speculate<br> on what you do.<br> I'd say you were in the drug business,<br> except the money's moving<br> in the wrong direction.<br> Whatever you're into, you seem<br> to be getting away with it,<br> so, uh, more power to you.<br> All right.<br> You want another bond?<br> You want to move the 10,000 you got<br> on Beaumont over to the stewardess.<br> That means paperwork.<br> I gotta get a death certificate,<br> present it to the court,<br> make out a receipt for<br> return of bond collateral,<br> I type up another application,<br> - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<br> - another indemnity agreement.<br> - I haven't got time.<br> - I'm telling you what I have to do.<br> What you have to do,<br> in case you forgot,<br> - is come up with a premium<br> of a thousand bucks.<br> - I can do that.<br> You know I got the money.<br> I just ain't got it with me.<br> Come back when you do.<br> I'll bond out the stewardess.<br> Look, you got to look at this<br> with a little compassion, all right?<br> Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't<br> used to this kind of treatment.<br> Gangsters don't give a fuck,<br> but your average citizen,<br> a couple of nights in County<br> get to fuckin' with their mind.<br> Ordell, this isn't a bar.<br> You don't have a tab.<br> Listen to me, all right?<br> You got a 44-year-old, gainfully<br> employed black woman falsely accused...<br> Falsely accused? She didn't come<br> back from Mexico with cocaine on her?<br> Falsely accused<br> of"intent".<br> If she had that shit...<br> and mind you, I'm saying if...<br> that was her own personal shit<br> to get high with.<br> Is white guilt supposed to make me<br> forget I'm running a business?<br> Oh, it's like that, huh?<br> All right.<br> I got your little<br> thousand bucks.<br> - Hey, Candy.<br> - Hey, Max.<br> Dropping off Lopez, Anita.<br> Picking up Brown, Jackie.<br> - Okay, no problem.

D?<br> You're serious?<br> # That wish would be<br> for you to live #<br> #Forever and ever #<br> Who paid my bond?<br> - Ordell?<br> - In cash.<br> #My heart skips a beat #<br> - #And I take to the sky<br> on a natural high #<br> - #I just take to the sky #<br> - #Loving you more till the day I die #<br> - # On a natural high #<br> - # Take to the sky on a natural high #<br> - #I don't know you #<br> #Loving you more ##<br> You got any cigarettes<br> in here?<br> You won't find<br> any cigarettes in there.<br> - Can we stop and get cigarettes?<br> - Sure.<br> Have you ever been<br> to the River Bottom?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - It's all right. It's a cop bar.<br> Can we just stop<br> at a 7-Eleven or something?<br> - I thought you might<br> like to have a drink.<br> - I'd love to, but not there.<br> How 'bout the Hilton<br> by the airport?<br> - Is it dark?<br> - Kind of a sports bar.<br> It doesn't sound dark.<br> Why does it<br> have to be dark?<br> Because it looks like I just<br> got out of jail, that's why.<br> You're dropping me off at my place.<br> There's a joint near me.<br> No, thanks.<br> I quit three years ago.<br> - Gain weight?<br> - Ten pounds.<br> Take it off and put it back on.<br> That's why I don't quit.<br> Mm.<br> If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch<br> of a time trying to find my rent.<br> You know,<br> the other day I figured out<br> that I must have written about...<br> I've been in the business.<br> I figure about 80% of those<br> were drug-related, so...<br> if you want, I could help you<br> figure out your options.<br> So far, they told me<br> if I cooperate,<br> then I'll get probation,<br> maybe.<br> Or if I stand mute,<br> I can get as much as five years.<br> Does that sound right?<br> I'd say that if they try you<br> and convict you, you won't get<br> more than a year and a day.<br> That's state time,<br> prison.<br> But they won't<br> want to do that.<br> They'll offer you simple possession,<br> a couple of months of county time...<br> and a year or two<br> of probation.<br> Do you happen to know who<br> put the dope in your bag?<br> Yeah.<br> But that's not<br> what this is about.<br> They were waiting<br> for my ass.<br> They knew about the money.<br> - They even knew the exact amount.<br> - What did they want to know?<br> Who gave me the money<br> and who I was givin' it to.<br> They found this guy in the trunk<br> of a car with his head blown off.<br> They said it was him<br> who told them about me.<br> That would be...<br> Beaumont Livingston.<br> How do you know<br> about him?<br> I wrote him on Monday.<br> They found him dead on Tuesday.<br> Ordell pick up his bond?<br> Same as you... $10,000.<br> #Back about 18 and 25 #<br> #I left Tennessee<br> very much alive #<br> - Thanks for the drink.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - The legal advice and the ride.<br> - You bet.<br> - # On a Tennessee stud #<br> - Good luck.

Oh, what is this?<br> What the fuck is this?<br> Hey, that ain't got nothing to do<br> with you. I carry that all the time.<br> You been talking<br> to them police too much.<br> - The police didn't try<br> and strangle my ass.<br> - Come on, girl.<br> - I was just playing with you.<br> - I ain't playing with you.<br> I'm gonna unload both<br> of these motherfuckers if you<br> don't do what I tell you to do.<br> - You understand what I'm saying?<br> - Jackie, stop acting crazy.<br> - Do you understand<br> what the fuck I'm saying?<br> - Yeah, woman. Damn!<br> Now, sit your ass down<br> on that sofa.<br> See?

You want to see<br> some motherfuckin' silly?<br> If I have to tell you to shut up<br> one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.<br> - I just came over here to talk to you.<br> - To talk?<br> The way I see it, you and me got one<br> motherfucking thing to talk about.<br> One thing,<br> and that's what you<br> are willing to do for me.<br> - I can get you a lawyer.<br> - No, let's be realistic.<br> Now, sooner or later they're gonna<br> get around to offering me a plea deal,<br> and you know that.<br> - That's why you came here to kill me.<br> - I ain't come over to kill you.<br> No, that's all right.<br> It's okay.<br> Now, I forgive you.<br> Now, let's say,<br> if I tell on you,<br> I walk.<br> - If I don't, I'll go to jail.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> I want $100,000...<br> in a escrow account<br> in my name...<br> if I'm convicted up to a year<br> or put on probation.<br> Now, if I have to do<br> more than a year,<br> you pay another $100,000.<br> I can do that.<br> - You know I got that problem.<br> All my money is...<br> - In Mexico.<br> - Right.<br> - Well, I been thinking about that too.<br> I got me an idea.<br> Uh...<br> Let me hear that.<br> We friends again.<br> Why don't you point that<br> motherfucking gun somewhere else?<br> - I'll talk to the cops tomorrow<br> and tell you if it's on.<br> - All right.<br> You want your gun back?<br> Come in and I'll<br> get it for you.<br> Max, look,<br> I am so sorry about this.<br> You know,<br> I was afraid to ask to borrow it,<br> 'cause I was afraid you would say no.<br> I mean, you'd have to.<br> Would you like<br> some coffee?<br> - If you're having some.<br> - I am. Come on in.<br> Why don't you make<br> yourself at home.<br> Just, you know,<br> have a seat.<br> Did you get a chance<br> to use it?<br> I felt a lot safer<br> having it.<br> Oh, the milk went bad<br> while I was in jail.<br> - Black's fine.<br> - Cool.<br> Would you, uh, care to<br> hang on to it for a while?<br> It wouldn't be legal, but if it<br> makes you feel better, I guess...<br> Well, thanks.<br> I got one now.<br> - You went out this morning<br> and bought a gun?<br> - What? I didn't hear you.<br> - You went out this morning<br> and bought a gun?<br> Well, let's say<br> I got one now, okay?<br> - Somebody loan it to you?<br> - Yeah.<br> All right!<br> We're on.<br> It might be a little black.<br> Would you like to hear some music?<br> Sure.<br> Cool.<br> You know, I couldn't wait<br> to get home last night...<br> and wash the jail<br> outta my hair.<br> - It looks nice.<br> - Thanks.<br> You never got into<br> the whole CD revolution?<br> Oh, I got a few, but I can't afford<br> to start all over again.<br> I mean, I've invested too much<br> time and money...<br> in my albums.<br> Yeah, but you can't get<br> new stuff on records.<br> I don't get new stuff<br> that often.<br> # I gave my heart<br> and soul #<br> #To you, girl #<br> #Didn't I do it, baby #<br> - #Didn't I do it, baby #<br> - It's pretty.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> - Who is this?<br> - The Delfonics.<br> - #Didn't I do it, baby #<br> - It's nice.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - #Didn't I do it, baby #<br> I called in sick today. As far as<br> the airline knows, I'm still available.<br> - Are you?<br> - I don't know. I'm gonna go in<br> and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today.<br> I'm going to do what you suggested...<br> offer to help and see what happens.<br> What I meant was to have a lawyer<br> do the negotiating for you.<br> No, I want to talk to them first.<br> I know more now about Ordell's money.<br> Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy<br> that wants you, that'll only<br> interest him up to a point.<br> I know, but it's<br> a lot of money.<br> It's a half a million dollars<br> all in Cabo, and more coming in.<br> - How'd you find that out?<br> - Ordell told me last night.<br> - He called?<br> - He came by.<br> - What'd you do?<br> - We talked.<br> Do you think<br> he still trusts you?<br> He had his doubts at first,<br> but he's always trusted me.<br> And he wants to believe more than<br> anything else that he still can.<br> - Why?<br> - Because he needs my ass.<br> Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit<br> over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?<br> No, thank you. There's gotta be<br> other ways of getting it out.<br> Maybe, but I'm the only one<br> he's ever used.<br> I mean, he can't use his other people.<br> They're crooks.<br> I mean, he might try to...<br> bring the money in himself,<br> but he ain't gonna wanna<br> stand in no customs lines.<br> So, either he recruits another Cabo<br> stewardess or he continues to trust me.<br> And I made him feel<br> like he still can.<br> Are you gonna offer<br> to set him up?<br> Yeah, if I get off.<br> Otherwise, fuck 'em.<br> It's very possible that<br> Ordell's killed somebody.<br> Do you realize that?<br> Well, I ain't going back to jail and I<br> ain't doing that probation thing again.<br> Max, how do you feel<br> about getting old?<br> You're not old.<br> You look great.<br> No, I'm asking you<br> how do you feel about getting old.<br> - Doesn't it bother you?<br> - It's not really something<br> I think about.<br> - Really?<br> - I guess I got sensitive<br> about my hair a few years ago.<br> It started falling out,<br> so I did something about it.<br> How'd you feel about that?<br> I feel fine with it.<br> Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.<br> I did it to feel better about myself,<br> and, you know, I do.<br> I look in the mirror.<br> Looks like me.<br> Yeah, but it's<br> different for men.<br> You know, I can't really feel<br> too sorry for you in this department.<br> I bet that,<br> except for possibly an afro,<br> you look exactly<br> the way you did at 29.<br> Well, my ass<br> ain't the same.<br> Bigger?<br> Yeah.<br> Ain't nothing wrong<br> with that.<br> Something else worry you?<br> Oh.<br> I always feel like I'm starting over.<br> - How many bonds you said you wrote?<br> - 15,000.<br> - Is that a lot?<br> - That's plenty.<br> #Pass them by #<br> Well, I've flown<br> over seven million miles,<br> and I've been waiting<br> on people for 20 years.<br> Then after my bust, the best job<br> I could get was with Cabo Air,<br> which is the worst job<br> you can get in this industry.<br> You know I make<br> plus retirement benefits<br> that ain't worth a damn?<br> And with this arrest hanging over<br> my head, Max, I'm scared.<br> And if I lose this job,<br> I gotta start all over again,<br> and I ain't got nothing<br> to start over with.<br> I'll be stuck<br> with whatever I can get.<br> # Oh, baby, please now #<br> And that shit is<br> more scary than Ordell.<br> #La, la, la means #<br> #I love you ##<br> - Let's go.<br> - You don't have to... Ow!<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey, great, you're here.<br> - Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing?<br> - Fine.<br> - Can I have a word outside<br> with Ray for a minute?<br> - Sure. Take your time.<br> - I'll just be a minute.<br> - May I smoke?<br> Absolutely.<br> - Dude, what up?<br> - She wants to make a deal.<br> - Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?<br> - She almost sounds scared.<br> - What's she want?<br> - She wants to go back to work.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> So what's she going to give us?<br> - She hasn't gone into specifics.<br> - She's been waiting for you to get here.<br> - She knows it's my case, right?<br> Well, she hasn't said it,<br> but she's not stupid.<br> - She knows it's you who wants her.<br> - Let's go. Cool.<br> Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.<br> Now, what can we do for you?<br> I need permission to leave<br> the country so I can keep my job.<br> - Yeah, we can look into that.<br> - I need it tomorrow.<br> If I don't show up for<br> work tomorrow, I'm fired.<br> Well, you know<br> what we want.<br> If I'm working,<br> I can help you.<br> Help us do what, Jackie?<br> - Help you get Ordell Robbie.<br> - So now, you do know him.<br> You never asked<br> if I did or not.<br> - So you're telling us now<br> that you do know him.<br> - Of course I do.<br> - I deliver money for him.<br> - No shit?<br> - You know how he makes his money?<br> - He sells guns.<br> - You ever see him sell a gun?<br> - No.<br> - Then how do you know he sells guns?<br> - He told me.<br> Besides, why else would<br> a A.T.F. man be after him?<br> Well, how can<br> you help us?<br> I'll do anything I can to help you<br> get his ass, short of wearing a wire.<br> And in return for my help,<br> I need permission to leave the country,<br> and immunity.<br> You don't want much,<br> do you?<br> Can you do it or not?<br> You know, I mean...<br> It's possible.<br> You're going to hear a guy<br> beg for his life, lady,<br> 'cause he betrayed<br> Nani Vitali.<br> Read the paper.<br> Read it!<br> Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.<br> He's already killed<br> two people.<br> - You know what he's known as?<br> The Mad Dog Murderer.<br> - Hey, girl.<br> - iHola!<br> Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like<br> somebody got some new clothes.<br> Yeah, we did<br> a little shoppin'.<br> You know, I couldn't have my boy<br> running around looking like no bum.<br> - I don't know. I didn't look like a bum.<br> - Come on now, man.<br> - You know you had that<br> Salvation Army thing going.<br> Goddamn, girl. You getting high already?<br> It's just 2:00.<br> It's that late?<br> You smoke too much of that shit, that<br> shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.<br> Not if your ambition<br> is to get high and watch TV.<br> - Oh, y'all a couple of<br> Cheech and Chongs, huh?<br> Oh, don't get up. I got it.<br> Have a seat.<br> Yo. Jackie!<br> What's up?<br> No, Jackie,<br> I didn't get your message.<br> - I was gonna tell you!<br> - No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.<br> - Is she a good lay, huh?<br> - Here.<br> - You gotta make sure<br> ain't nobody following you.<br> - It's ready to go?<br> Yeah.<br> There's another bowl left.<br> Let me go!<br> Take your thumb off the carb.<br> You mean, the sign that's<br> got the rooster on it?<br> Shit.<br> You okay?<br> I'm just... gettin' old.<br> I can't... smoke or laugh<br> now without coughing.<br> Coughing's good.<br> It opens up the capillaries.<br> You know, when you cough, you're<br> pulling air... or in this case, smoke...<br> into parts of the lungs that<br> don't normally get used.<br> And so, coughing's good.<br> It gets you higher.<br> You definitely know<br> a lot about that.<br> Look here, Louis, I got<br> to run out for a little while.<br> So, since you like<br> getting high so much,<br> why don't you hang out here with Mel,<br> watch a little TV?<br> - Way ahead of you.<br> - See, I get high later<br> on when I come back.<br> See, I get high at night when I<br> get through with all my business.<br> That Rutger Hauer?<br> No, it's Helmut Berger.<br> Hmm.<br> - Why don't you walk me<br> to the door, space girl?<br> - Okay.<br> - You know, I hope you don't mind<br> hanging out with Louis.<br> - No problem.<br> Try not to tear his clothes off of him,<br> all right? They're new.<br> - Ha, ha, ha!<br> - Ha, ha!<br> - Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.<br> - Okay. Later.<br> Want a Metrix?<br> Uh... Damn. Shit.<br> What's a Metrix?<br> It's like this major meal that you drink<br> in a shake instead of having a big meal.<br> - It's like a diet thing?<br> - No. It's what bodybuilders<br> drink to, you know, beef up.<br> No, thanks.<br> Okay.<br> When was the last time<br> I saw you?<br> Oh... six, seven years ago.<br> It doesn't seem<br> like that long ago.<br> It was that long ago.<br> - How old were you in this picture?<br> - Which one?<br> The roller disco picture.<br> This one.<br> Oh. Um, 14.<br> - You were 14 here?<br> - Yup.<br> Shit, man.<br> I thought you were at least 16.<br> Well, I'm about the same height<br> now as I was then.<br> Bruno! Sanchez!<br> - That other picture, that green one?<br> - Yeah?<br> That was taken at that place<br> called Flippers.<br> Do you remember that? It was in<br> Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then?<br> - No.<br> - Where were you?<br> I was in Detroit.<br> With Ordell?<br> Yeah. We had done<br> some time already.<br> Oh. Were you a...<br> disco guy?<br> Nah.<br> - Come on. Don't lie.<br> - No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.<br> - Were you ever in one?<br> - I went to a few just<br> to meet women, but...<br> it was so loud<br> and I didn't like to dance.<br> During that whole scene,<br> I just drank in bars usually.<br> So who didn't make the cut?<br> - That's a picture of me in Japan.<br> - Whose arm is that?<br> Uh, that's the guy<br> that I lived with.<br> His name was Hi-Hiro...<br> Hiro... Hiroshi.<br> He must have made quite an impression.<br> If you count cheese.<br> I never got to know him really.<br> You know, I couldn't speak anyJapanese,<br> and his English was terrible.<br> But what am I going to say? His English<br> was better than myJapanese, you know.<br> - That sounds like a problem.<br> - Not really.<br> You know, we didn't have that much<br> to say to each other anyway.<br> I never really got to know him,<br> but I knew enough to know...<br> that I wasn't<br> missing much, so...<br> Anyway, I keep that picture because,<br> of all the fucking time I was there,<br> that's the only picture<br> I've got of me in Japan.<br> - That's Japan.<br> - Oh. Yeah.<br> Well... Yeah, I can...<br> Yeah, it looks... I could tell.<br> Wanna fuck?<br> Yeah.<br> That was fun.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, that really hit the spot.<br> Now we can catch up.<br> Yeah.<br> You got a beer?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> In the fridge.<br> # Uh, I mean, damn<br> Me and you forever hand in hand #<br> #I'm married to the firm, boo<br> You got to understand #<br> #I'll die for 'em, gimme a chair<br> and then I'll fry for 'em #<br> - #And if I got to take the stand<br> I'ma lie for 'em #<br> - #Lie for 'em #<br> - #It's me and you hand in hand #<br> - #Forever #<br> - #I'm married to the firm, boo<br> You got to understand #<br> - # That we be #<br> #I'll die for 'em, gimme a chair<br> and then I'll fry for 'em #<br> - #And if I got to take the stand<br> I'ma lie for 'em #<br> - # Uhh, sugar ##<br> I'm going<br> to the bar, baby.<br> # Two people #<br> - JackieJack!<br> - Hey.<br> Damn! I'm gonna have to remember<br> this place. This is all right.<br> About two minutes from your crib,<br> ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.<br> - What's your drink, brother?<br> - Let me get a screwdriver, home.<br> - How're you doing?<br> - Oh, I'm fine.<br> Yes, you are.<br> Damn! I bet you come<br> in here on a Saturday night,<br> you need nigger repellant to keep<br> them motherfuckers off your ass.<br> - Oh, I do okay.<br> - Bullshit, Jackie.<br> You're a fine motherfucker. I bet<br> you do a damn sight better than okay.<br> - You think anybody followed you?<br> - I don't think so.<br> But it don't matter, 'cause they<br> already know I'm meeting you.<br> - How the fuck they know that?<br> - I told them.<br> - You told...<br> - 3.25.<br> - Here. Keep it.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - You told 'em it's me?<br> - They already know it's you.<br> Goddamn, that don't mean<br> you got to confirm it.<br> Look, the only way they're going<br> to give me permission to fly...<br> is if I agree to help 'em, which is<br> what I have to appear to be doing.<br> So I might as well give them<br> somebody they already know... you.<br> You tell 'em<br> anything else?<br> Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico<br> and you want me to bring it in.<br> - Goddamn... You told them all that?<br> - It's true, ain't it?<br> What the fuck that got<br> to do with anything?<br> They know I'm<br> delivering for you.<br> I told 'em about the half mil.<br> They could give a fuck about it.<br> All they wanna do<br> is catch your ass with guns.<br> So I said, "Look, you want proof<br> he's getting paid for selling 'em?<br> - Let me bring in the money".<br> - And they said?<br> Yes.<br> Hey, what's the matter? I mean,<br> that's what we discussed last night.<br> This is just seeming kind of risky now,<br> you know. Fuck this.<br> Now, let me lay it all out<br> to you, okay?<br> I make two deliveries...<br> the first with 10,000.<br> You know, like a dry run?<br> They watch it, see how it works.<br> Then the second delivery,<br> I come home with the half mil.<br> Mm-mm, mm-mm.<br> See, that's too much exposure.<br> - Now, I ain't goin'<br> nowhere near that money.<br> - You don't have to.<br> I told them you never<br> pick up the money yourself.<br> - You always send someone,<br> and I never know who it is.<br> - Mm.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> - If you listen, it's a damn good idea.<br> Now, the first time I do it,<br> they're looking around,<br> they see me hand<br> the 10,000 to someone.<br> - Who?<br> - I don't know. A friend of yours.<br> - Like a woman?<br> - If you want.<br> Yeah. Yeah,<br> I'm thinking a woman.<br> Wait a minute.<br> If they're gonna let you go,<br> - how come we don't bring all<br> the cash in the first time?<br> - 'Cause I don't trust 'em.<br> Now, the next trip,<br> when I bring in the half mils,<br> it's gonna look like I'm doing<br> the same thing as I did before.<br> - But you don't?<br> - No. I hand it to someone else first.<br> Hmm.<br> And they follow the wrong one,<br> thinking she's bringing<br> the money to me.<br> - That's the idea.<br> - So, we gonna need two women.<br> - Can you cover that?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I got<br> the women covered.<br> Where are you planning<br> on pulling this off?<br> The Del Amo Mall,<br> the food court.<br> And I suppose you see<br> a piece of this for yourself?<br> It's my plan.<br> We're in this together.<br> Yeah, but it's my money<br> and I don't need no fuckin' partners.<br> I ain't your partner.<br> I'm your manager.<br> And I'm managing to get your money out<br> of Mexico, into America, in your hands,<br> and I'm managing to do it<br> all under the nose of the cops.<br> So, therefore, I'm your manager,<br> and a manager gets 15%.<br> - No, a manager gets ten percent.<br> - No, that's an agent.<br> - I'm gonna give you ten.<br> - No. No.<br> A manager gets 15%,<br> agent gets 10.<br> I'm getting 15%,<br> all right?<br> All I'm gonna give you<br> is ten.<br> And the same deal<br> as before.<br> I can do that.<br> So he says, "Fuck that",<br> and moves over into guns.<br> See, you can sell guns wherever there's<br> a demand, and nobody gives a shit.<br> He's acting like he's this<br> big international arms dealer...<br> when, come on, face it, the only people<br> he ever sold to were dopers.<br> Well, he seems<br> to be making out.<br> - Is it dead?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, well...<br> so far, he is.<br> But you got to admit,<br> he's not too bright.<br> Oh... I wouldn't go<br> so far as to say that.<br> He moves his lips<br> when he reads.<br> What does that<br> tell you?<br> Let's say that he's<br> streetwise, you know.<br> We'll give him that.<br> He's still a fuckup.<br> He killed a man who<br> worked for him the other day.<br> Well...<br> So, what are you trying<br> to tell me?<br> That I should get<br> out of here?<br> That's not what<br> I'm saying at all.<br> You know where he went?<br> He went to go meet that stewardess.<br> - Does that bother you?<br> - Please!<br> Well, I don't know.<br> You live with him, so...<br> No, I live here.<br> He just drops in and out.<br> Did he tell you about that half million<br> he's got down in Mexico?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Of course he did.<br> He tells anybody who's gonna listen.<br> Well, that's what him<br> and that stewardess are doing.<br> They're scheming on how<br> they can get that money over here.<br> And your point is?<br> - Let him and the stewardess<br> get the money over here,<br> - Uh-huh.<br> and then just<br> take it from them.<br> #A man we passed<br> just tried to stare me down #<br> - Can I ask you a question?<br> - Oh, man.<br> - You ain't gonna get serious<br> while we're in here chilling?<br> - No. It's just about Melanie.<br> You know what?<br> I'm real sorry about that, man,<br> but I had to be somewhere<br> all of a sudden.<br> I figured, well, shit,<br> Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.<br> So I thought, let him<br> kick it here with Mel.<br> # The things that you do #<br> So, what she say?<br> She didn't have to say shit.<br> I know Melanie.<br> That bitch is gonna be fucking you<br> two minutes after I'm out the door.<br> Melanie real good about<br> throwing a fuck a nigger's way.<br> I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,<br> but she likes to fuck.<br> - Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?<br> - Is that what you thought?<br> - No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.<br> - But you fucked her anyway?<br> Well...<br> the "not your girlfriend" part<br> I felt more about.<br> Oh. Well, I hope you felt<br> appropriately guilty afterwards.<br> Afterwards, I did.<br> Oh, oh, shit.<br> But, um...

See, I knew it.<br> I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't<br> have to say nothing. I know that bitch.<br> I don't understand why you keep<br> someone around your business<br> and you can't even trust 'em.<br> I ain't gotta trust her.<br> I know her.<br> I don't know<br> what that means, man.<br> Well, you can't<br> trust Melanie,<br> but you can always trust<br> Melanie to be Melanie.<br> Well, I don't understand<br> why you keep her the fuck around.<br> I told you, man.<br> She's my fine little surfer girl.<br> You know, she ain't pretty<br> as she used to be...<br> and she bitch a whole lot more<br> than she used to,<br> but she white.<br> You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.<br> Hi, Jackie. It's Max.<br> I was just calling to find out<br> how everything went today at A.T.F.<br> If you want to call me,<br> my home number is...<br> 915-9302.<br> Or you can reach me<br> at my office, which is...<br> 313-3688.<br> It's on the card I gave you<br> when we first met.<br> I don't know whether you still have it,<br> but it's on it.<br> Oh, let me give you<br> my beeper number.<br> It's 991-1075,<br> then dial 6872.<br> Wait for a beep,<br> dial 59...<br> and hit the pound.<br> Um, okay, so I'll talk<br> to you later.<br> Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.<br> End of message.<br> Now, the money's gonna be in<br> a Del Amo shopping bag, all right?<br> I get some food, sit down here in<br> the food court, then your girl comes in.<br> - Did you find somebody yet?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Who?<br> - What you care?<br> What I care is my ass<br> facing the penitentiary.<br> - You send some hardheaded<br> rock whore up here and she...<br> - Hey, hey, hey, hey!<br> She ain't gonna be no rock whore.<br> She's gonna be cool, promise.<br> - All right, so we straight, right?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> I'm gonna roll up over here and<br> check out this shirt I was looking at.<br> - I'll catch you.<br> - Hey, don't forget your bags.<br> Shit!<br> Max! Max!<br> Hey.<br> Well, hello.<br> - Hey, surprise.<br> - I walked right past you.<br> I know, ignoring me.<br> So, what are you up to?<br> - Just catching a movie.<br> - What'd you see?<br> What the fuck<br> is up with this shit?<br> - I called you last night.<br> - I know. I got your message.<br> Ray wanted to have dinner<br> with me so we can, you know,<br> talk about the sting we're plotting.<br> That's what he calls it,<br> a sting.<br> He's been...<br> He's been real nice.<br> You think he's got<br> a thing for you?<br> Maybe.<br> But I'm thinking it's something more<br> like he wants the money for himself.<br> Has he hinted around?<br> No. He just tries<br> to act cool.<br> You know, I don't think there's<br> anything wrong with that.<br> He's just a young guy<br> having fun being a cop.<br> I know the type.<br> Trust me on this.<br> He's more interested in Ordell<br> than he is in the money.<br> If he does anything suspect, it'll be<br> cutting corners to get the conviction,<br> but he wouldn't walk off with the money;<br> it's evidence.<br> - And what about you, Max?<br> - What?<br> If I was<br> in Nicolet's place?<br> No, I mean you right now,<br> not if you were somebody else.<br> If I saw an opportunity to walk away<br> with a shopping bag full of money,<br> would I take it?<br> You know where it came from. It's not<br> like it's somebody's life savings.<br> It wouldn't even be missed.<br> Half a million dollars<br> will always be missed.<br> You're avoiding<br> the question, Max.<br> Okay, sure, I guess<br> I'd be tempted,<br> especially now since I'm getting out<br> of the bail bond business.<br> - Why?<br> - A lot of reasons.<br> I guess the main one would be,<br> uh... I'm tired of it.<br> When did you decide?<br> It's been<br> a long time coming,<br> but I finally<br> made up my mind.<br> I guess it was... Thursday.<br> Miss Brown?<br> - Yes?<br> - I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.<br> The night you got me<br> out of jail?<br> Yeah.<br> I went to pick up this guy.<br> I hear he's staying<br> at a house, and, uh...<br> I sneak in<br> and I'm waiting for him...<br> Wait a minute. After we were together,<br> you snuck into a guy's house?<br> Yeah. I went back to my office<br> and found out that you took my gun,<br> got another gun<br> and the stun gun,<br> went to this guy's house in El Monte<br> and waited for him to come home.<br> - What do you do when he comes home?<br> - Shoot him with the stun gun.<br> While he's incapacitated,<br> you cuff him and take him to County.<br> - You do that?<br> - It's my job.<br> - Did you do that that night?<br> - Well, the guy never came home.<br> But I'm sitting on his couch<br> in the dark holding my stun gun.<br> The whole house<br> smells of cat pee.<br> And after a couple of hours,<br> I think,<br> "What am I doing this?<br> It's 19 years<br> of this shit".<br> And I make up my mind.<br> That's it.<br> I'm not sure you answered<br> my question, Max.<br> Which one?<br> If you had the chance,<br> unemployed now,<br> to walk away<br> with a half million dollars,<br> would you take it?<br> We gotta stop<br> meeting like this.<br> - How was your flight?<br> - Fine.<br> - Bet you're happy to be working again.<br> - Yeah.<br> This is A.T.F.

Yeah.<br> I don't know if he lives there,<br> but I can find out.<br> - Did you talk to him?<br> - Not really. Mm-mm.<br> His full name's Louis Gara.<br> Just did four years up in Susanville.<br> - For what?<br> - Bank robbery.<br> We've been following him.<br> He definitely works for Ordell.<br> They did two years together about,<br> I don't know,<br> over at Huntsville.<br> He's not living over<br> in Hermosa Beach, though.<br> Ordell's got him staying<br> down in Compton.<br> living with some 56-year-old<br> petty thief, some woman named, uh...<br> Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.<br> Hmm.<br> - You know her?<br> - No.<br> - They ever talk about her?<br> - Not yet.<br> Okay, who's the other one?<br> Some white chick named Melanie,<br> another girlfriend of Ordell's.<br> - What's her deal?<br> - It was her coke I got busted with.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - She knows everything.<br> She's not a part of it,<br> and she's pissed off<br> that she's not a part of it.<br> Well, this is definitely<br> somebody I wanna meet.<br> Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?<br> Everything okay?<br> Everything's the same,<br> except for one change.<br> - I told him Ordell's changing<br> the amount he's bringing in.<br> - Think they bought it?<br> Mm, oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking<br> that Ordell's real nervous,<br> and they love thinking<br> that he's scared of'em.<br> You know, a good cop will never let you<br> know that he knows you're full of shit.<br> All he needed was<br> a reasonable explanation.<br> Everything's the same,<br> except for one change.<br> What's that?<br> Ordell feels way too hot<br> for him to bring in his money,<br> and he knows you're watching him<br> and he's fucking paranoid.<br> - So he's sweating a little bit.<br> - He's gonna keep his half mil<br> where it is,<br> but he's gonna bring in 50,000<br> just in case he needs bail.<br> - It'll be more than that.<br> - Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.<br> You still have to show him<br> the money at the airport.<br> I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.<br> He'll see 50,000.<br> - And where's the rest of it?<br> - In the bag, underneath.<br> - What ifhe checks?<br> - He won't. He didn't before.<br> He's expecting to see 50,000,<br> and there it is, on top.<br> - You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.<br> - Not really.<br> If he finds it, I'll say<br> Mr. Walker put it in there...<br> and I didn't know anything about it,<br> like the coke.<br> - Well, then you're out. You get nothing.<br> - Yeah, but I'm not in jail...<br> and at least I tried.<br> You're going to have<br> surveillance all over you.<br> That's why you don't make a move<br> until I come out of that fitting room.<br> - Wearing a dress.<br> - Well, a suit.<br> There's this one I had my eye on.<br> You know, it's like...<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello?<br> Look here, we got<br> a little change in plans.<br> No, no, no, no,<br> it ain't no thing.<br> Everything's the same,<br> except one little difference.<br> You know that bitch Simone<br> you saw in the mall?<br> Well, she wasn't here today<br> 'cause she done split on my ass.<br> Yeah. Me and Louis went by her pad.<br> She gone.<br> She gone, her shit's gone and my<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Don't start buggin' on me.<br> Goddamn it, I'm telling you,<br> ain't nothing different.<br> Everything's just like<br> we discussed.<br> Now, except for this time<br> when we make the split,<br> instead of Simone<br> it's gonna be Melanie.<br> I think someone's knocking<br> on the door.<br> Goddamn it, Melanie gotjust<br> as much sense as that bitch has,<br> she'd be in the same place.<br> All right.<br> Yeah, later.<br> Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.<br> I hope he's a good sailor.<br> Chicken shit.<br> Okay, the envelope contains $50,000.<br> I've counted it,<br> and I'm now marking the bills...<br> in the upper left-hand corner in the<br> second zero with a green felt-tip pen.<br> Ever been tempted?<br> What?<br> Put one of these in my pocket?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> If I did, I'd have to give<br> one to you, wouldn't I?<br> Of course, nobody knows<br> how much there is.<br> I guess we could take as much<br> as we want. Isn't that right?<br> Yes.<br> All those things are true.<br> I mean, it's not like<br> the money belongs to anybody.<br> - That would be one point of view.<br> - Yeah.<br> Except it's not a point of view<br> shared by the A.T.F.<br> Once we make this evidence,<br> it belongs to us.<br> You're officially out of trouble now.<br> Don't go doing<br> something stupid.<br> How can I do anything stupid<br> when I'm being watched every second?<br> You know,<br> I'm glad you pointed that out,<br> 'cause it saves me the trouble<br> of pointing it out to you.<br> Now, look.<br> Here's the deal.<br> I want you to take<br> all this cash.<br> I want you to put it in this<br> Billingsley shopping bag.<br> And that is exactly<br> what I expect to see...<br> when I look inside Sheronda's<br> Billingsley shopping bag.<br> Comprende?<br> - Si, comprende.<br> - Cool.<br> Hey, there's only three reasons<br> you couldn't make your court appearance.<br> One, you in a hospital,: two,<br> you in jail,: three, you ass is dead.<br> - That means you're not my friend, man.<br> Why're you putting...<br> - Winston!<br> - Wait.

Go get 'em.<br> There's nobody in there.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Last stall.<br> Got it.<br> I wasn't even gonna buy anything.<br> #...do it, baby #<br> #I tried so many times<br> and that's no lie #<br> #It seems to make you laugh<br> each time I cry ##<br> All right. Just keep drivin' to Ninth,<br> where all them car dealerships is.<br> We gonna leave this heap<br> in the parking lot and pick up...<br> a car the cops don't know<br> nothin' about.<br> Where's Melanie?<br> Well, that's what I wanna tell you. You<br> see, she was buggin' me the whole time.<br> She got pissy with me 'cause<br> I wouldn't let her carry the bag.<br> And then she started runnin' her<br> fuckin' mouth about, you know, like...<br> 'cause I couldn't remember where the car<br> was parked right away when we came out.<br> So then she got on me about that.<br> "Is it this aisle, Louis?<br> Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was<br> totally fuckin' with my nerves, man.<br> - So, what? You left her there?<br> - l-I shot her.<br> You shot Melanie?<br> - Twice. In the parking lot.<br> - You couldn't talk to her?<br> - Well, how can you talk to her?<br> You know how she is.<br> - You couldn't just hit her?<br> Maybe, but at that time...<br> moment, I don't know, l...<br> You shot her?<br> Twice?<br> - Is she dead?<br> - I-I... Pretty much.<br> What do you mean "pretty much", Louis?<br> That ain't no fuckin' answer.<br> - Yes or no. Is she dead?<br> - l-I think so.<br> - You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she...<br> - She's dead. She's dead.<br> - Well, where'd you shoot her?<br> - In the chest and the stomach.<br> If you had to do it,<br> then you had to do it, brother.<br> What we don't want<br> is that bitch survivin' on us.<br> Anybody but that woman.<br> Louis?<br> What?<br> Where's the rest of it?<br> - How much is there?<br> - I don't know. Maybe 40.<br> Shit, maybe less.<br> Well, you...<br> you said 550.<br> Yeah, so you light, ain't you?<br> You light about half a million, ten.<br> Look, look, man.<br> That's the bag she came out with.<br> - She never put her hand in it.<br> Neither did I.<br> - Came out of where?<br> The fitting room. It went down<br> exactly the way it was supposed to.<br> - How long was she in there?<br> - A minute. Not even a minute.<br> She came right out.<br> - Louis, you tellin' me the truth?<br> - Listen, I swear to God, man.<br> I swear on my life.<br> She came out with that fuckin' bag,<br> and I took it from her.<br> - And then what?<br> - And that was it.<br> We went to the parking lot.<br> - Where you shot her?<br> - That's right.<br> Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room<br> somewhere with a half million dollars...<br> I worked my ass off to get<br> waitin' for you?<br> - Oh, fuck you for asking me that.<br> - Hey, I know the bitch<br> tried to set me up.<br> - Fuck you, brother.<br> How could you fuckin' ask me that?<br> - She didn't ask you?<br> Shit!<br> Pull the car<br> over a minute.<br> Why'd you ask me that?<br> - All right, so where's<br> the gun you shot her with?<br> It's in there.<br> Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?<br> I could've taken two out already.<br> It's Jackie Brown.<br> Well, you know, if she got to it,<br> why didn't she take it all?<br> Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch<br> before I blow her brains out.<br> Well, maybe the Feds<br> got it.<br> Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.<br> See, if there wasn't nothin'<br> in that bag but them towels,<br> then maybe she didn't get<br> a chance to take the money...<br> out of her suitcase<br> and the A.T.F. got it.<br> But she put them books<br> in there to trick our ass.<br> Well, that's why I didn't check it.<br> Because the bag felt right.<br> That's right.<br> And then she puts 40 grand or so<br> in there to rub that shit in my face.<br> You know what I'm sayin'?<br> She wants me to know she ripped me off.<br> Ah. I don... I don... You know,<br> I don't know. I don't know.<br> Unless, you know, either she's<br> got it or the Feds got it.<br> Or... Or...<br> Now, check this out.<br> What if she gave the money<br> to somebody else first...<br> before Melanie even went<br> in the dressing room.<br> Uh-huh.<br> - Oh, man. You know what?<br> - What?<br> - Do you know who I saw<br> in the dress department?<br> - No, tell me.<br> I didn't think anything of it.<br> I... No, no, I did wonder<br> what he was doin' there.<br> I wondered what he was doin' there, but<br> I thought it had nothin' to do with us.<br> Like, maybe he was with his wife<br> or his girlfriend. It's a big place...<br> Louis, Louis, Louis!<br> You gonna tell me who you saw?<br> - Yeah, Max Cherry.<br> - Max Che...<br> You seen Max Cherry<br> in the dress department where we...<br> Man, look at me<br> when I'm talkin' to you!<br> You see that motherfucker<br> in the dress department when we<br> about to get a half million dollars.<br> - And you don't think nothin'<br> about him bein' there?<br> - No. Do they know each other?<br> Hell, yeah, they know each other.<br> He bonded her ass out of County.<br> - Well, how am I supposed to know that?<br> - You know your bail bondsmen.<br> You know all them motherfuckers<br> is crooked as a barrel of snakes,<br> don't you?<br> Why should I think something's weird<br> if I don't know nothin' about them<br> knowin' each other?<br> - I don't wanna hear<br> no fuckin'excuses, Louis.<br> - I ain't givin' you excuses.<br> But I'm tellin' you... I don't fuckin'...<br> I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.<br> Oh, you gonna tell me<br> the reason...<br> you lost every goddamned cent<br> I got in the world?<br> - Hey... Hey, man.<br> - You gonna tell me reasons?<br> - You better...<br> - Let me tell you the reason,<br> motherfucker.<br> The reason is your ass<br> ain't worth a shit no more.<br> You better fuckin'<br> back off, man.<br> What the fuck happened to you, man?<br> Her ass used<br> to be beautiful.<br> You didn't tell me<br> you were goin' shoppin'.<br> - I thought I did.<br> - Yeah, well, you didn't.<br> You know,<br> if it's me...<br> and I got all that shit hangin' over<br> my head like you got hangin' over yours,<br> I don't know,<br> I'd go shoppin' later.<br> Well, I got there early.<br> You see, I've had my eye on this suit...<br> that I've wanted, and, well,<br> I'm just gonna go try it on...<br> - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> - Wait, wait, wait. Just wait a minute.<br> Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?<br> Let me finish.<br> I got there early. The idea was to<br> try on the suit, see if I liked it.<br> If I did, they would wrap it up,<br> and I would put back on my uniform...<br> 'cause Sheronda<br> is expecting me to wear it.<br> Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag<br> with the $50,000 and go home.<br> Yeah, but you didn't do that.<br> Because I couldn't.<br> Ray, I swear.<br> Melanie burst in.<br> She grabbed the bag.<br> And then somebody<br> fuckin' killed her for it.<br> What happened<br> to the bag she gave you?<br> She didn't give me a bag.<br> Melanie was not a part of the plan.<br> Ordell probably told her<br> to do it.<br> That's why she came into the dressing<br> room, grabbed the bag, took off.<br> But I couldn't go after her,<br> because I was in my fucking underwear.<br> And I had to put on this suit because I<br> could put it on faster than my uniform...<br> - You had time to pay the sales chick.<br> - I had to. Ray, I was frantic.<br> What was I supposed<br> to do?<br> All right,<br> what you do after that?<br> I went lookin' for you. And I went<br> back to the place in the mall...<br> where you were before,<br> but you weren't there.<br> What was I supposed to do<br> if something happens?<br> You didn't tell me how to do that.<br> There was a guy<br> with Melanie?<br> There was nobody<br> in the fitting room.<br> Okay.<br> You've no idea what happened<br> to the $50,000.<br> - You're clueless, right?<br> You've no idea where the 50 grand is?<br> - I have no idea.<br> - None.<br> - You have no idea... It could've<br> gone here, could've gone there?<br> I know nothin'. Not a clue.<br> I don't have an idea where<br> the motherfuckin' money is.<br> - Not even a little idea. A maybe.<br> - Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.<br> - You'd take a polygraph?<br> - Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin'<br> make you happy!<br> Yeah, put it right there.<br> I'll do it.<br> Man.<br> I sure hope you didn't do<br> anything stupid, Jackie.<br> Can I talk to you<br> for a second?<br> Fuck.<br> Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him<br> shot in the car on Ninth.<br> And we lost Ordell.<br> I thought you were<br> fuckin' watchin' him.<br> We were,<br> and we lost him.<br> He walked into a strip bar sometime<br> around 3:30 and never came out.<br> The bar was on Ninth, what,<br> less than a mile and a half<br> from where they found Louis.<br> It looks like Louis' buddy<br> shot him twice, point-blank range.<br> - So what's gonna happen now?<br> - We pick up Ordell.<br> We got three murders we can link him to,<br> and we got you.<br> What about me?<br> What about you?<br> You think I took<br> some of that money?<br> Hey, I have no evidence<br> of you doin' anything.<br> You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit<br> with marked bills.<br> I'm glad to see that.<br> You've been helpin' us out.<br> You gave us Melanie.<br> You gave us Louis.<br> Melanie was found with a packet<br> of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.<br> That goes a long way<br> in backing up your story.<br> I'll settle for Ordell<br> with marked bills.<br> But if there's<br> anything else...<br> you haven't told me about, you know<br> what, that's between you and Ordell.<br> I just got one thing<br> to say.<br> You better hope we find him<br> before he finds you.<br> No, no, no, I done told you,<br> I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr. Walker.<br> I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway<br> till I get my motherfuckin' money.<br> Come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you<br> wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.<br> Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein' who<br> my friends are, motherfucker, right...<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Motherfucker hung up on me.<br> You believe that shit?<br> Ingrate nigger.<br> See, you bring a motherfucker up,<br> next thing you know they breaking<br> you off some goddamned disrespect.<br> Motherfuck!<br> Shit!<br> Goddamn, girl.<br> How you live like this?<br> - Like what?<br> - Like this.<br> This some repugnant shit.<br> Bail bonds.<br> - Yeah, Max there?<br> - He ain't here right now, man.<br> - Well, where he at? Out of town?<br> - He's around, man.<br> - Well, give me his home number.<br> - No, I'll give you his beeper number!<br> All right.<br> Break out the beeper number, nigger.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I've been looking for you.<br> - Do you know who this is?<br> - This is Mr. Robbie, isn't it?<br> I have your 10,000.<br> That's why you called.<br> The bond collateral that you put down<br> on Beaumont Livingston...<br> and moved over<br> to Miss Brown, remember?<br> Oh, she got off,<br> did she?<br> They decided to no-file<br> this morning.<br> Tell me where you are.<br> I'll come give you your money.<br> You still there?<br> Look here, man.<br> I know you helped her.<br> And I know you know<br> what I want.<br> And Jackie can tell me any story<br> comes into her pretty little head,<br> as long as at the end of that story<br> she hands me my motherfuckin' money.<br> Now, she wanna be my friend,<br> she do that.<br> She don't want to be<br> my friend no more,<br> well, you just tell her<br> to think about old Beaumont.<br> And if she go to the police,<br> you tell her I will name her ass<br> as my accessory.<br> And we'll go upstate,<br> hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.<br> And that's a promise.<br> Do you understand what I'm sayin'?<br> You tell her that,<br> and I'll call you back.<br> You're right.<br> It was Ordell.<br> If you have time, do you think you could<br> find out where he's stayin' for me?<br> Cops can't locate him, huh?<br> - They don't have<br> your winning personality.<br> Sure thing. I don't have to know what<br> I'm doing, just as long as you know.<br> I think I do.<br> Good enough?<br> You bet.<br> Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on<br> the door like the goddamned police?<br> - You lookin' to get shot?<br> - I thought you might be asleep.<br> You keep fuckin' with me,<br> you the one gonna be asleep... forever.<br> I'm alone.<br> Get your ass<br> in the house.<br> No, freeze, motherfucker.<br> What you doin'?<br> Got your money...<br> your bond refund?<br> This all?<br> - I have a receipt for you to sign.<br> - No, no, no, motherfucker.<br> You know what I mean.<br> You talked to her?<br> She wants to give you<br> your money.<br> If she didn't, there'd be cops<br> batter-ramming your door down right now.<br> - How'd you find me, anyway?<br> - Winston found you.<br> - How'd he find me?<br> - That's what he does.<br> He finds people<br> that don't wanna be found.<br> Oh, well,<br> bully for that nigger.<br> So, she wanna give me<br> my money, huh?<br> Yeah. She wants to give it<br> to you herself, and she wants<br> to collect her ten percent.<br> She also wants to explain<br> why she had to hang on to it.<br> Oh, and I wanna hear<br> that shit too.<br> Turn around.<br> Put your hands on your head.<br> Why don't you<br> tell me why?<br> Jackie didn't trust Melanie.<br> She'd already tried to getJackie<br> to go in with her,<br> split the half million<br> amongst themselves.<br> What she did was take quite a risk<br> to make sure you got your money.<br> And you helped her,<br> didn't you?<br> All I did was walk out<br> with it.<br> Y'all went to all that trouble<br> just to protect my interest?<br> In a way, yes.<br> My ass may be dumb,<br> but I ain't no dumb ass.<br> Go over there and sit<br> on that couch.<br> Don't worry about her.<br> She don't even know you're here.<br> Sit down.<br> Place stinks.<br> You get used to it.<br> - Where my money at?<br> - My office.<br> - WhereJackie at?<br> - She's been there since Thursday night.<br> If she want to talk to me,<br> how come she wasn't home?<br> - She's afraid.<br> - Oh, right. That I gotta see.<br> She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot<br> before she can tell you what happened.<br> - Tell her to bring the money over here.<br> - It's in the safe; she can't.<br> Call her and give her<br> the combination.<br> Look, I'm tellin'you,<br> you got her spooked.<br> She won't leave there till you<br> get your money and you're gone.<br> Oh, you expect me<br> to just go walkin' in there?<br> If she wanted to set you up,<br> you'd be in custody by now.<br> When you told her that<br> you'd name her as an accessory,<br> that scared her more than anything.<br> - She believed you.<br> - Mmm.<br> Then that's why she wanted<br> to give me my money, ain't it?<br> It ain't got nothin' to do<br> with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?<br> See, I ain't trust Melanie,<br> either, but I could handle her.<br> That was my little<br> blonde-haired surfer girl.<br> And I told that fuckin' Louis all he<br> had to do was hit her in the mouth.<br> But no,<br> he had to shoot her.<br> - Jackie's at your office, huh?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> She by herself? That big-ass nigger<br> Winston ain't there, is he?<br> She's all alone.<br> All right.<br> I call over there,<br> she better answer the phone.<br> She will.<br> I'll be here.<br> See you in a bit.<br> Goddamn.
