                        No!<br> No!<br> Details of the brutal slaying<br> of Page Forrester...<br> ...at the Forresters' Baker Beach<br> weekend retreat, are still sketchy.<br> Her husband, John C. Forrester,<br> has been rushed to St. Paul's Clinic.<br> The Times-Lofton publishing empire,<br> founded by her grandfather in 1876....<br> - I'm District Attorney Krasny.<br> - Yes, sir, Mr. Krasny.<br> - What are you doing outside?<br> - I needed air.<br> You got a lot of headlines in there.<br> It's a forced rear entry.<br> Window at the back. We're upstairs.<br> It's the maid.<br> Consuela Martinez.<br> And that's Page Forrester.<br> Christ!<br> We've got multiple stab wounds.<br> The wounds are jagged.<br> The blade must have a kind of serration.<br> I'll know much more tomorrow.<br> The cause of death is obvious.<br> - Where was Forrester?<br> - Over here.<br> He comes in, he gets hit. He blacks out.<br> He comes to and goes upstairs<br> and finds them.<br> - And saw what?<br> - The bodies.<br> - Where is he now?<br> - St. Paul's Clinic.<br> - Mr. Krasny, was she raped?<br> - Is it a ritual killing?<br> We have no comment.<br> Do you have any leads?<br> We have no comment.<br> No sign of sperm.<br> No evidence of any real sexual pattern...<br> ...apart from the specific wounds<br> we found on the wife.<br> The knife used was a heavy blade...<br> - ...six inches, with a serrated upper edge.<br> - I'm betting a hunting knife.<br> The rope you could buy at any Safeway.<br> No prints were found, except Forrester's,<br> his wife's and the maid's.<br> The blood on Forrester's clothes<br> was that of the wife but not the maid's.<br> What about his head wound?<br> No concussion, some bleeding.<br> Blunt object.<br> Come on, Hal,<br> you know what I'm asking you.<br> Possibly self-inflicted?<br> Got it! Everything was in her name.<br> The corporate stuff, personal, everything.<br> She owned the guy.<br> He was an employee, and you know what?<br> He gets it all.<br> Jack Forrester is the direct beneficiary...<br> ...of all Page Forrester's corporate<br> and personal assets.<br> Do you really think<br> he could've done that to his own wife?<br> What the hell is "that"? You murder<br> your wife to take all the money?<br> "That" is the oldest crime in the world.<br> Only you're real smart...<br> ...so you make it look like<br> some fucking Charlie Manson did it.<br> You want people to say: "Do you think<br> he could've done that to his own wife?"<br> If I was gonna kill my wife,<br> that's the way I'd do it.<br> Mr. Forrester, why didn't you go out<br> to the beach house with your wife?<br> I had dinner at the Union Club<br> and then I went back to the paper.<br> - I checked on the Sunday editorials.<br> - You don't write those yourself, do you?<br> I didn't think editors<br> wrote their own editorial.<br> Sometimes they do.<br> Did you write the ones about me?<br> Yes. I insisted on writing all of those.<br> Is that relevant here?<br> - The editorials I wrote on Mr. Krasny?<br> - I was just going to object.<br> Objection sustained.<br> I was just curious, that's all.<br> Page was a woman<br> of great generosity and compassion.<br> I think the thing I'll miss<br> about my sister the most...<br> ...is her great sense of resolve.<br> Page always did<br> whatever she set out to do.<br> I'll miss her more than I know how to say.<br> Thank you.<br> Nice service.<br> Krasny.<br> Now?<br> He's gonna ride my ass into the Senate.<br> He can't do that. You're innocent.<br> The fuck he can't.<br> You've been coming here for weeks now...<br> ...putting the best apples<br> on top of the barrel. I don't buy it!<br> You say you were happy?<br> You ever argue? Any problems?<br> We've been over this and over this.<br> And we're gonna go over it again,<br> and again and again.<br> Frank, there's no need<br> to badger Mr. Forrester.<br> Right, Counsellor?<br> Mr. Forrester...<br> ...I'm not trying to get you to admit<br> you whacked your wife around every day...<br> ...but I wanna know if you ever argued.<br> I never said we didn't argue.<br> - So, you argued.<br> - What did you argue about?<br> I told you, we had the usual arguments.<br> - We were married!<br> - Arnold needs to speak to you, sir.<br> I thought you had the only perfect<br> marriage in the state of California.<br> That's fine, Mr. Fabrizi, but let's get back<br> to the bit about the lockers.<br> The club gives me a passkey, you know.<br> So, I go through them.<br> The members don't even know<br> I've been in there.<br> I've seen all their stuff.<br> Their rubbers and everything.<br> - That's when I saw it.<br> - The knife?<br> - Yeah, the knife.<br> - When did you see it?<br> When?<br> It was right after New Year's last year.<br> They like me to go in there<br> at the start of the year and clean them out.<br> Start the year off with clean assholes.<br> Excuse me.<br> They let you clean out private lockers?<br> Sure, they trust me.<br> I been workin' for them for 20 years.<br> What kind of knife did you see?<br> A hunting knife, about 6 inches long<br> with a jag on the edge.<br> How'd you know it was Forrester's locker?<br> 'Cause it was numbered 122<br> and that's his number.<br> Because right after I saw it,<br> I thought to myself:<br> "I didn't know Mr. Forrester was a hunter."<br> It kind of made me feel good, you know...<br> ...that he was a hunter, you know?<br> Yeah. I know what you mean.<br> - I'm getting tired of this, Andrew.<br> - Look, admit it, she owned you.<br> - I'm getting tired of this.<br> - We're all getting tired of it.<br> We've been doing this too long.<br> I had no quarrel with the financial structure<br> of the company.<br> Do you hunt, Mr. Forrester?<br> What?<br> Have you ever been hunting?<br> No.<br> - Do you own a hunting knife?<br> - No.<br> What the fuck is going on?<br> Have you ever been in possession<br> of a hunting knife?<br> No.<br> I'm giving you a chance to cop a plea.<br> You think I killed my wife? Prove it.<br> You're under arrest for the murders<br> of Page Forrester and Consuela Martinez.<br> Frank, read him his rights.<br> You have the right to remain silent.<br> If you give up that right...<br> ...anything you say can and will be used<br> against you in a court of law.<br> Mr. Forrester is the editor<br> of the "San Francisco Times..."<br> ...and president of Times-Lofton Publishing.<br> He is, however,<br> charged with two capital offence felonies.<br> But, your Honour, the charges are based<br> purely on circumstantial evidence.<br> Mr. Forrester has no prior criminal record.<br> I don't expect him to flee the jurisdiction.<br> Fine. The set bail of $500,000 will stand.<br> I made some calls back east.<br> I'll get you a heavy hitter.<br> I don't want anyone from out of town.<br> I don't want to contribute<br> to the goddamn circus.<br> Your firm has got to handle it.<br> We're corporate lawyers.<br> We can barely handle a hearing.<br> - Jack, you got something for us?<br> - What do you think?<br> I'm innocent. That's all I can say.<br> - What do you think of Krasny?<br> - No further comment.<br> Come on!<br> Isn't this related to the Senate race?<br> No further comment.<br> My paper has been critical of Mr. Krasny's<br> conduct as district attorney.<br> That's no secret. He's an ambitious guy.<br> He's got big political aspirations...<br> ...so you can draw<br> your own conclusions. Excuse me.<br> No comments at this time. Please, folks.<br> This will be a show trial, for God's sake.<br> We've only one person<br> who's had any criminal experience.<br> - Who is he?<br> - She.<br> And she hasn't practised criminal law<br> for four years.<br> Jack, give us a --<br> - Is she any good?<br> - Yes, she was a very good prosecutor.<br> She worked for Krasny.<br> Well.<br> Teddy, are you familiar<br> with the Forrester case?<br> I go out of my way<br> not to be familiar with criminal cases.<br> Mr. Forrester wishes to speak to you<br> about representing him.<br> I'm in the middle of a case, Andrew.<br> I think it can wait, don't you, Andrew?<br> Oh, yes. Teddy --<br> Nothing in the world will make me go back<br> to criminal work, Andrew.<br> You know the decision I made.<br> There is nothing in the world I'd like less<br> than to lose Jack Forrester as a client.<br> Teddy, you know the affection<br> I've always had for you.<br> Nothing would please me more...<br> ...than one day being able to speak to you<br> as one of my partners.<br> Please, do an old man a personal kindness.<br> Speak to him.<br> Who lives here anyway, Joe Montana?<br> I told you. A guy called Jack Forrester.<br> He killed his wife. I saw it on TV.<br> He allegedly killed his wife.<br> That means he's gonna get away with it.<br> So, how do I look?<br> Weird.<br> - Good morning, madam.<br> - 'Morning.<br> Mr. Forrester is expecting you.<br> No, I agree Carl, but the murders<br> happened over two months ago...<br> ...and there's no leads<br> because Krasny's locked into me.<br> Excuse me, I'll be right with you.<br> I'll tell you guys<br> what I'm gonna do at the meeting.<br> All right, I've gotta go.<br> I'll be home all evening,<br> so if you need me you can catch me here.<br> All right, 'bye.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - I'm glad you came.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> Nice meeting you.<br> We met at a party five or six years ago.<br> You probably don't remember.<br> You said you like horses.<br> Very much.<br> Come on.<br> - Andrew spoke to you?<br> - Yes, he did.<br> And?<br> And the problem is,<br> I just don't do criminal work anymore.<br> Yes, I know, he told me.<br> I was hoping you'd reconsider.<br> I didn't kill my wife.<br> - I didn't ask you if you did.<br> - If you represented me, you would.<br> I'd ask about the case<br> they had against you.<br> I'd want to win my case.<br> Did you win all your cases<br> when you were a prosecutor?<br> Yes, I won every one.<br> Is that why you wanted me<br> to represent you?<br> Yes, and because you're a woman<br> and because you're good.<br> You know what Krasny's capable of.<br> Thanks, Karen.<br> All right, let's show her what you got.<br> Come on!<br> I love this beauty.<br> He was Page's pride and joy.<br> Isn't he beautiful?<br> The oldest equine species.<br> The most beautiful...<br> ...perfectly tempered...<br> "It makes men imperious<br> to sit on a horse."<br> Oliver Wendell Holmes, right?<br> Well, he was wrong.<br> Look at his legs.<br> Shows how vulnerable we all are.<br> What's with this lead on Krasny<br> we're running Sunday?<br> It's a profile. Reviews his career,<br> Iooks at the Senate race.<br> The Senate race is nine months away!<br> - I just thought now would be --<br> - Look, folks!<br> I don't want any slant, any bias<br> on our coverage of my case or of Krasny.<br> You hear me?<br> I've put my nuts into this paper<br> for 15 years. I want objective coverage.<br> I'll be taking a leave of absence<br> until my trial's over.<br> Carl's gonna be running things.<br> I'm gonna miss you.<br> Thank you.<br> You know how much I'm gonna miss<br> these goddamn machines?<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Barnes.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Is Mr. Barnes here?<br> - Yes, right over there.<br> - Hi.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> We went to the zoo.<br> David's been after me for weeks.<br> Damn! I was gonna take him<br> to the zoo next weekend.<br> Oh, well, we'll just do something else.<br> Starving.<br> Did I hear something about you<br> and the Forrester case?<br> You heard wrong.<br> Matthew, remember Tom Krasny?<br> May l?<br> I think you should take the case.<br> - Think of the fun we'll have.<br> - It wouldn't be any fun.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Too bad about Styles.<br> What?<br> Don't you remember Henry Styles?<br> He's dead.<br> What?<br> I'm sorry.<br> You didn't know.<br> He hanged himself.<br> When?<br> Day before yesterday.<br> I don't know how you figure it.<br> Teddy and I send this guy to the joint<br> four years ago.<br> He's halfway to his parole hearing,<br> and he hangs himself.<br> You take care.<br> Good night.<br> When's Bridget gonna be back?<br> Bridget is coming back tomorrow.<br> - What's for dinner?<br> - What do you want? I'll cook you anything.<br> - Oh, God, Mum. You can't cook.<br> - Either can Bridget.<br> Yes she can. I thought you liked Bridget.<br> She farts too much.<br> So do you.<br> At least not atom bombs.<br> - Did you finish your homework?<br> - Yes.<br> Was Dad here last night?<br> He was? Why didn't he wake us?<br> He kissed you when you were asleep.<br> - 'Bye, Mum.<br> - Bye-bye, honey.<br> David.<br> David!<br> Can I have my kiss?<br> Tell him to wake me next time.<br> I will.<br> 'Bye, Mum.<br> Have a good day.<br> Mrs. Styles.<br> You have no place here.<br> Just a goddamn minute!<br> Yes?<br> Christ.<br> You look like a real broad.<br> Come over here.<br> It's good to see you.<br> Come on in. Oh, yes.<br> Teddy, I'm a busted tyre for Christ's sake.<br> My lungs are shot.<br> I can't even piss straight.<br> You were the best investigator<br> the DA's office ever had.<br> - That was a long time ago.<br> - Four years!<br> I know the fuck how long ago it was.<br> Henry Styles.<br> Dumb fucking asshole. He hanged himself.<br> - I know.<br> - I know you know. You're here, aren't you?<br> Forrester isn't Styles, right?<br> Let's say the bastard didn't do it.<br> You're never gonna get him off.<br> If he didn't do it, I'll get him off.<br> Stop the horseshit, Teddy.<br> Look, I don't give a flying fuck<br> how much money he's got.<br> A rich guy like Forrester...<br> Where the hell's he going to find<br> a jury of his peers?<br> He'll get a lot of people<br> who hate him for what he's got.<br> If he didn't do it...<br> ...I'll get him off.<br> Forget Styles, will you? Forget him!<br> You're going to eat yourself alive<br> with all that guilt.<br> I can't forget him, and neither can you.<br> The fuck I can't!<br> - Sam, I'm responsible and so are you.<br> - Like hell I am!<br> Tom Krasny is responsible!<br> And fuck Styles and fuck you<br> and your goddamned guilt!<br> I'll take the case on one condition:<br> If you lie to me, or if I think you're guilty,<br> I'll drop out.<br> That's not professional, and you know it.<br> It's not a problem.<br> I'm not going to lie to you.<br> Okay.<br> I want Sam to have access to all your<br> personal and corporate correspondence.<br> Your financial records,<br> your wife's records...<br> - ...everything. Absolute access.<br> - You got it.<br> We've got four months to the trial.<br> I don't want you out in public.<br> I don't want pictures of you in the paper.<br> Look as if your life's been shattered.<br> My life has been shattered.<br> I don't want any visible support<br> from the firm, unless I ask for it.<br> I want to defend him alone.<br> Not with a team of high-priced lawyers.<br> The jury will like that.<br> I like her.<br> Yeah? She pisses me off.<br> Nice to meet you.
