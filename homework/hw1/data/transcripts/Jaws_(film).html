Never.<br> You're not born here,<br> you're not an Islander. That's it.<br> Don't bother him. Come right back.<br> I know you got<br> a lot of problems downtown...<br> ...but I've got a couple of problems<br> I wish you'd take care of.<br> One, I've got some cats parking<br> in front of the house, I can't get...<br> What I need is a red zone.<br> It's simple, you could take care of it.<br> Would you come here a minute, please?<br> Are you okay?<br> Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.<br> Look, if the kids goin'<br> in the water is worrying you...<br> ...they can play out here on the beach.<br> It's all right.

I can't talk to you.<br> I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner.<br> This is turning into a contest.<br> It's not just the Gazette.<br> She's advertising in out of town papers.<br> I suggest we move to council chambers<br> where we'll have more room.<br> I'm responsible for public safety here.<br> Then go out tomorrow<br> and see that no one gets hurt.<br> It's a small story.<br> I'll bury it as deep as I can.<br> The ad is gonna run on the back<br> along with the grocery ads.<br> Right in here, please.<br> Move on in, please.<br> Why do you insist on playing the heavy?<br> I have a point of view and it speaks<br> for many of the people here.<br> Not only me, because I have the motel.<br> How do you feel about it?<br> Let's have some order.<br> Let's have some order, please.<br> Any special questions?<br> Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark<br> in cash or check?<br> I don't think that's funny.<br> I don't think that's funny at all.<br> All right, all right.<br> That's private business between<br> you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.<br> Martin, would you please...<br> Chief Brody.<br> I just want to tell you<br> what we're planning so far.<br> What about the beaches, Chief?<br> We're gonna put on the extra<br> summer deputies as soon as possible.<br> And then we're gonna try<br> and use shark spotters on the beach.<br> Are you going to close the beaches?<br> Yes, we are.<br> We're also bringing in some experts<br> from the Oceanographic Institute.<br> Only 24 hours.<br> I didn't agree to that.<br> Only 24 hours.<br> You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.<br> I'll catch this bird for you.<br> It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.<br> Not like goin' down to the pond<br> and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.<br> This shark, swallow you whole.<br> Shakin', tenderizin'. Down you go.<br> And we got to do it quick.<br> Got to bring back the tourists that'll put<br> your businesses on a payin' basis.<br> But it's not gonna be pleasant.<br> I value my neck a lot more than $3,000.<br> I'll find him for $3,000,<br> but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.<br> You got to make up your minds.<br> Gonna stay alive and ante up...<br> ...gonna play it cheap<br> and be on welfare the whole winter.<br> I don't want no volunteers.<br> I don't want no mates.<br> There's too many captains on this island.<br> $10,000, for me, by myself.<br> For that, you get the head,<br> the tail, the whole damn thing.<br> Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.<br> We'll take it under advisement.<br> Mr. Mayor, Chief...<br> ...ladies and gentlemen.<br> Oh, God, you scared me.<br> People don't even know<br> how old sharks are.<br> If they live 2,000,<br> Enough. You're not going to be able<br> to go to sleep tonight.<br> Here. Come on.<br> Thanks.<br> Want to get drunk and fool around?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Mikey really loves his present.<br> Where is he?<br> Sitting in it.<br> Good God.<br> All right, Michael, out of the boat.<br> Tied up to the jetties, sittin' in the boat.<br> I'm helpin' Michael.<br> - Get out of that boat.<br> - Hi, Dad.<br> Just a little longer. Please?<br> - It's his birthday tomorrow.<br> - I don't want him on the ocean!<br> He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat.<br> He's not gonna go in the water.<br> I don't think he'll go in the water again,<br> after what happened yesterday.<br> Now don't say that.<br> I don't want that to happen,<br> you know that.<br> I want him to read the boating regulations,<br> the rules...<br> ...before he goes out on his own.<br> Michael, did you hear your father?<br> Out of the water now!<br> I'm tired.<br> Let's stop before someone reports us.<br> The chief lives on the other side<br> of the island.<br> Am I comin' in straight?<br> Just keep rowin'.<br> We better catch something,<br> this is my wife's holiday roast.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> $3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.<br> Come and get it.<br> The tide's takin' it right out.<br> Can't we go home?<br> He's takin' it.<br> Go, go, go.<br> Charlie, take my word for it.<br> Don't look back. Swim, Charlie. Swim.<br> Come on, Charlie, swim to me!<br> Keep comin'.<br> - I can't get up.<br> - Give me your hand, Charlie.<br> - Help me!<br> - Get your feet out of the water!<br> Can we go home now?<br> So then Denherder and Charlie<br> sat there tryin' to catch their breath...<br> ...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife<br> what happened to her freezer full of meat.<br> That's not funny. That's not funny at all.<br> Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad<br> in Field and Stream.<br> Looks more like The National Enquirer.<br> All right, hold it, hold it.<br> Hold everything. I said, hold it!<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, back, young feller. How are you?<br> Say, I hope you're not goin' out<br> with those nuts, are you?<br> The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.<br> You have to move out,<br> or he can't get out at all.<br> Don't raise sail, you're just gonna luff it.<br> You got a paddle on the boat?<br> Officer, wait a second. Wait a second.<br> How many guys are you gonna put<br> in that boat?<br> Whatever's safe, right?<br> - Yeah, well that ain't safe.<br> - Watch it, that's dynamite.<br> - Where are you goin' with that?<br> - I'm goin' on the boat.<br> - Help me get those guys out of the boat.<br> - Sure.<br> Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you<br> that you're overloading that boat.<br> Go on, get out of here.<br> - You ain't going. What do you care?<br> - Can you tell me...<br> ...if there's a good restaurant<br> or hotel here?<br> Yeah, you walk straight ahead.<br> They're all gonna die.<br> Listen to me.<br> We've got some road block signs outside.<br> You've got to get somebody to help us.<br> Yeah, get those road block signs<br> out on the highway.<br> Because we've got more people<br> down here than we can handle.<br> What are you doing?<br> These are your people. Go talk to them.<br> They aren't mine. They're from all over.<br> You see the plates in the parking lot?<br> Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...<br> I'm all by myself out there.<br> What happened to the extra help?<br> That's not until the Fourth of July.<br> You know those guys<br> in that fan-tail launch out there?<br> None of them will get<br> out of the harbor alive.<br> That's what I'm saying. You know<br> their names. Talk to those clowns.<br> - Everyone seems to be having a good time.<br> - Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.<br> Could you tell me<br> how I could find Chief Brody?<br> Who are you?<br> Matt Hooper.<br> I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.<br> For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.<br> I'm Brody.<br> - I'm glad to meet you.<br> - Me, too.<br> I know you got a lot<br> on your hands right now, but...<br> The best thing for me to do is<br> to see the remains of the first victim.<br> The girl on the beach.<br> - Just bear with me, will ya?<br> - Sure.<br> Wait'll we get them silly bastards<br> down in that rock pile.<br> There'll be some fun.<br> They'll wish their fathers<br> had never met their mothers...<br> ...when they start diggin' the bottoms out<br> and slammin' into them rocks.<br> Get away from there, you goddamn fool!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You want to swamp us,<br> you crazy son of a bitch?<br> What are these guys doin' out here?<br> - What are they doin' back there?<br> - They're chummin' right now.<br> - What is that?<br> - They're tracking the shark now.<br> $3,000 divided four ways is what?<br> Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.<br> Victim identified as Christine Watkins,<br> female Caucasian.<br> - And here's the way we have it.<br> - Probable boating accident.<br> The height and weight of the victim can<br> only be estimated from the partial remains.<br> The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.<br> There are no major organs remaining.<br> May I have a glass of water?<br> The right arm has been severed<br> above the elbow with massive tissue loss...<br> ...in the upper musculature.<br> Thank you, very much.<br> Partially denuded bone remaining.<br> This was no boat accident.<br> - Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?<br> - No. It was only local jurisdiction.<br> The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum<br> and portions of the rib cage are intact.<br> Do not smoke in here.<br> Thank you very much.<br> This is what happens.<br> Indicates the non-frenzy feeding<br> of a large squalus, possibly longimanus...<br> ...or isurus glaucus.<br> The amount of tissue loss<br> prevents any detailed analysis...<br> ...however, the attacking squalus<br> must be larger...<br> ...than any normal squalus<br> found in these waters.<br> Didn't you get a boat<br> and check these waters?<br> This is not a boat accident.<br> And it wasn't any propeller.<br> It wasn't any coral reef.<br> And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.<br> It was a shark.<br> I wanna go AP and UPI.<br> I wanna get on the state wire services.<br> See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.<br> Call Dave Axelrod in New York<br> and tell him he owes me a favor.<br> This is the shot I want<br> with everybody and the fish in it.<br> Guys, could we please get organized?<br> I want to get a picture for the paper.<br> - Ben Gardner get this?<br> - No, no. We caught it.<br> - That's swell.<br> - It's a beauty, eh?<br> I need a picture for the paper.<br> Clear out of the way, please.<br> Just the guys that caught the fish.<br> Open it up a little bit.<br> I want to get a picture<br> of the guy with the fish.<br> I need a picture for the paper.<br> Could we get the sign please?<br> Young fella,<br> could you step out of the picture?<br> We're ready.<br> - Can you get that, please.<br> - How's that?<br> Larry, you won't believe it.<br> - What kind of a shark is that?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I think it's a mako.<br> - It's got a deep throat, Frank.<br> - Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark?<br> - Tiger shark.<br> A what?<br> We can start breathing again.<br> - Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?<br> - You bet he is.<br> What is this bite radius crap?<br> You stuff your friggin' head in there man,<br> and find out if it's a man-eater.<br> All I'm saying,<br> is that it may not be the shark.<br> I want you to meet Matt.<br> This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.<br> - Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.<br> Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos...<br> And the chances that these bozos got<br> the exact shark...<br> - There are no other sharks like this here.<br> - It's 100 to 1.<br> I'm not saying that this is not the shark.<br> It probably is, Martin.<br> It's a man-eater.<br> It's extremely rare for these waters.<br> The fact is,<br> the bite radius on this animal is different...<br> ...than the wounds on the victim.<br> I want to be sure. You want to be sure.<br> We all want to be sure. Okay?<br> What I want to do is very simple.<br> The digestive system<br> of this animal is very, very slow.<br> Let's cut it open.<br> Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...<br> ...is bound to still be in there.<br> And then we'll be sure.<br> It may be the only way to confirm it.<br> Look, fellas let's be reasonable.<br> This is not the time or the place...<br> ...to perform some kind<br> of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.<br> I am not going to stand here<br> and see that thing cut open...<br> ...and see that little Kintner boy spill out<br> all over the dock.<br> I just found out...<br> ...that a girl got killed here last week.<br> And you knew it.<br> You knew there was a shark out there.<br> You knew it was dangerous.<br> But you let people go swimming anyway.<br> You knew all those things...<br> ...but still my boy is dead now.<br> And there's nothing you can do about it.<br> My boy is dead.<br> I wanted you to know that.<br> I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.<br> No, she's not.<br> All right, fellas...<br> ...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down<br> before it stinks up the island.<br> Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow<br> and dump it in the drink.<br> Come here.<br> Give us a kiss.<br> Why?<br> Because I need it.<br> Get out of here.<br> The door was open.<br> Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.<br> Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.<br> Your husband's home?<br> I'd really like to talk to him.<br> Yes, so would I.<br> Can I get you some coffee?<br> Wine. How nice.<br> How was your day?<br> Swell.<br> I got red and white.<br> I didn't know what you'd be serving.<br> That's nice.<br> Is anyone eating this?<br> My husband tells me you're in sharks.<br> Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it<br> quite put that way. But yes, I am.<br> I love sharks.<br> - You love sharks?<br> - Yeah, I love them.<br> When I was 12 years old, my father got me<br> a boat, and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.<br> I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...<br> ...I hooked a four and a half foot<br> baby thresher shark...<br> ...who proceeded to eat my boat.<br> He ate my oar, hooks,<br> and my seat cushions.<br> He turned an inboard into an outboard.<br> Scared me to death...<br> ...and I swam back to shore.<br> When I was on the beach...<br> ...I turned around and I saw my boat<br> being taken apart.<br> Ever since then,<br> I have been studying sharks...<br> ...and that's why I'm gonna go<br> to the Institute tomorrow...<br> ...and tell them that you still have<br> a shark problem here.<br> - Why do you have to tell them that?<br> - I'm sorry, I thought that...<br> You told me the shark was caught.<br> I heard it on the news.<br> I heard it on the Cape station.<br> They caught a shark, not the shark.<br> Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.<br> And probably not the shark<br> that killed the little boy.<br> Which I wanted to prove<br> by cutting the shark open...<br> You may want to let that breathe...<br> Nothing.<br> You'll be the only rational man<br> left on this island after I leave tomorrow.<br> Where are you going?<br> I am going on the Aurora.<br> - The Aurora? What is that?<br> - It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.<br> Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.<br> Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.<br> Martin sits in his car when we go<br> on the ferry to the mainland.<br> I guess it's a childhood thing.<br> There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?<br> Drowning.<br> Is it true that most people get attacked<br> by sharks in three feet of water...<br> ...about 10 feet from the beach?<br> And before people started<br> to swim for recreation...<br> ...I mean before sharks knew<br> what they were missing...<br> ...that a lot of these attacks<br> weren't reported?<br> That's right.<br> Now this shark that swims alone,<br> what's it called?<br> - Rogue.<br> - Rogue, yeah.<br> Now, this guy...<br> ...he keeps swimmin' around in a place<br> where the feeding is good...<br> ...until the food supply is gone. Right?<br> - That's called territoriality.<br> It's just a theory<br> that I happen to agree with.<br> Then why don't we have one more drink<br> and go down and cut that shark open?<br> Can you do that?<br> I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.<br> We start in the alimentary canal...<br> ...open the digestive tract.<br> - Just like I thought.<br> - What?<br> Came up from the Gulf Stream<br> from southern waters.<br> He didn't eat a car, did he?<br> Tiger shark's like a garbage can.<br> It'll eat anything.<br> Somebody probably threw that in the river.<br> That's it.<br> I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.<br> You got a bigger problem than that.<br> You still got a hell of a fish out there...<br> ...with a mouth about this big.<br> How do we confirm that by morning?<br> If he is a rogue, and there's any truth<br> to territoriality at all...<br> ...we could spot him<br> between Cape Scott and South Beach.<br> - Where're you going?<br> - To find him. He's a night feeder.<br> - On the water!<br> - We're not gonna find him on the land.<br> I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - No, I'm not!<br> - I can't do that.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> I'm tellin' you,<br> the crime rate in New York'll kill ya.<br> There's so many problems, you never feel<br> like you're accomplishing anything.<br> Violence, rip-offs, muggings.<br> The kids can't leave the house.<br> You've got to walk them to school.<br> But in Amity,<br> one man can make a difference.<br> In 25 years, there's never been a shooting<br> or a murder in this town.<br> No kidding? Want a pretzel?<br> Where are we?<br> We're right in the stretch<br> where he's been feeding.<br> Can you get the Late Show on this thing?<br> No, it's a closed circuit TV system.<br> I have underwater cameras fore and aft.<br> Who pays for all this stuff?<br> The Government? The Institute?<br> This stuff cost a lot of money.<br> - I paid for this mostly myself, actually.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - You rich?<br> - Yeah.<br> How much?<br> Personally or the whole family?<br> Doesn't make any sense.<br> They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?<br> It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates<br> the water to live on an island, either.<br> It's only an island<br> if you look at it from the water.<br> That makes a lot of sense.<br> What is that thing doing?<br> It's a fish finder.<br> It's probably just a school of mackerel<br> or something, all clumped together.<br> Wait a minute.<br> - There's somethin' else out there.<br> - What is it?<br> About 100 yards, south, southwest.<br> - That's Ben Gardner's boat.<br> - You know him?<br> It's all banged up. Sure I know him.<br> He's a fisherman.<br> What happened?<br> I got to go down there and check their hull.<br> Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?<br> We will. I just got to check something out.<br> Keep the lights going.<br> Let's tow it in.<br> Don't worry, Martin.<br> Nothing's gonna happen.<br> What am I supposed to do<br> while you're gone?<br> Nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br> Don't touch any of the equipment.<br> I'll be back in two minutes.<br> This is a great white. A big one.<br> Any shark expert in the world<br> will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.<br> A great white shark has staked a claim<br> in the waters off Amity Island.<br> He'll continue to feed here<br> as long as there's food in the water.<br> There's no limit to what he'll do.<br> We've had three incidents.<br> Two people killed in a week.<br> It'll happen again.<br> It happened before, the Jersey beach, 1916.<br> - Five people were killed...<br> - In one week.<br> Tell him about the swimmers.<br> A shark is attracted to the exact kind<br> of splashing and activity...<br> ...that occurs whenever people swim.<br> You can't avoid it.<br> If you open the beaches<br> on the Fourth of July...<br> ...it's like ringing the dinner bell,<br> for Christ sakes.<br> I pulled a tooth, the size of a shot glass,<br> out of a boat out there.<br> It was the tooth of a great white.<br> It was Gardner's boat all chewed up.<br> I helped tow it. You should've seen it.<br> Where is that tooth?<br> Did you see it, Brody?<br> I didn't see it.<br> - He dropped it on the way in.<br> - I had an accident.<br> And what did you say<br> the name of this shark is?<br> It's a carcharodon carcharias.<br> It's a great white.<br> You don't have the tooth?<br> We depend on the summer people<br> for our lives...<br> You are not gonna have a summer<br> unless you deal with this problem.<br> We have to close the beaches,<br> and hire somebody to kill the shark!<br> We have to tell the Coast Guard.<br> You'll have to contact<br> the Shark Research Panel.<br> You'll have to ring this entire harbor.<br> I don't think either one of you<br> are familiar with our problems.<br> I know that you are going to ignore...<br> ...this problem until it swims up<br> and bites you on the ass!<br> Wait a second.<br> There are two ways to deal with this.<br> You're either gonna kill this animal,<br> or cut off it's food supply.<br> We have to close the beaches.<br> Sick vandalism.<br> That is a deliberate mutilation<br> of a public service message.<br> I want those little paint-happy<br> bastards caught...<br> ...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.<br> - That's it. Goodbye.<br> I won't waste my time arguing with a man<br> who's lining up to be a hot lunch.<br> Don't do this.<br> What we are dealing with here,<br> is a perfect engine, an eating machine.<br> It's really a miracle of evolution.<br> All this machine does is swim...<br> ...and eat, and make little sharks.<br> And that's all.<br> Now, why don't you take a long,<br> close look at this sign.<br> - Those proportions are correct.<br> - You'd love to prove that.<br> Get your name<br> into the National Geographic.<br> Larry, if we make an effort today,<br> we might be able to save August.<br> August? For Christ sake,<br> tomorrow's the Fourth of July.<br> And we will be open for business.<br> This will be the best summer<br> we've ever had.<br> If you are concerned about the beaches<br> do what you have to, to make them safe.<br> But those beaches will be open<br> for this weekend.<br> I want to know how many men<br> you're going to send.<br> I don't need to come to Brisbane...<br> ...when I have a great white shark<br> right here.<br> We need men to patrol the swimming area.<br> We've got to have help.<br> Anybody with a gun or a boat.<br> Monday!<br> Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?<br> He's the little guy with a crew cut.<br> Operator, isn't there a phone on the island?<br> Could you connect me, please?<br> Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?<br> The guys from the TV station<br> on the mainland are here.<br> All right. I'll get to them later.<br> Brody to Scutbucket, please come in.<br> Brody to Daisy, do you read me?<br> Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me?<br> Come in, Hooper. What do you see?<br> Nothing, here, Martin.<br> And nothing on sonar.<br> Amity Island has long been known<br> for it's clean air, clear water...<br> ...beautiful white sand beaches.<br> But in recent days...<br> ...a cloud has appeared on the horizon<br> of this beautiful resort community.<br> A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.<br> - Hi, Larry.<br> - Why aren't you in the water?<br> I just put some sun tan lotion on,<br> and I'm trying to absorb some...<br> Nobody's going in.<br> Please, get in the water.<br> Do me a favor, will you?<br> You and the other guys take the boat<br> and put it in the pond instead.<br> The pond's for old ladies.<br> I know it's for the old ladies,<br> but just do it for the old man.<br> - All right.<br> - Thanks.<br> I've got Sean.<br> Michael, wait!<br> Michael, I don't like you no more.<br> Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.<br> Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.<br> False alarm. Must be this glare.<br> I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news<br> that we have...<br> ...caught and killed a large predator<br> that supposedly injured some bathers.<br> As you see, it's a beautiful day.<br> The beaches are open,<br> and people are having a wonderful time.<br> "Amity," as you know, means "friendship."<br> My God!<br> Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350!<br> Martin, get them the hell out of the water.<br> No whistles! No whistles!<br> Everybody please, get out of the water.<br> Everybody out of the water.<br> Give an answer, please.<br> What's going on out there?<br> He made me do it.

Now.<br> Kill it!<br> Now!<br> Shoot!<br> Time.<br> What were you doin', anyway?<br> I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.<br> Let's see how long that barrel takes<br> to bring him up.<br> Free another barrel.<br> I'm comin' around again.<br> What do we do now? We're quittin', right?<br> We got one barrel on him.<br> We stay out here until we find him again.<br> We could radio in and get a bigger boat...<br> Don't you worry about it, Chief.<br> It won't be permanent.<br> You want to see something permanent?<br> You want to feel somethin' permanent?<br> Just put your hand underneath my cap.<br> You feel that little lump?<br> Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.<br> I got that beat.<br> It's a moray eel.<br> It bit right through my wet suit.<br> I don't know about that,<br> but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...<br> ...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.<br> See this?<br> I can't extend that. You know why?<br> 'Cause in the semi-final...<br> ...celebrating my third wife's demise...<br> ...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over.<br> Look at that.<br> That's a bull shark.<br> He scraped me when I was takin' samples.<br> I got something for you.<br> There's a thresher.<br> You see that? A thresher's tail.<br> - Thresher?<br> - It's a shark.<br> - You want a drink? Drink to your leg?<br> - I'll drink to your leg.<br> So we drink to our legs.<br> I got the crme de la crme.<br> Right here. Hold on.<br> Here, you see that?<br> You're wearin' a sweater.<br> Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.<br> She broke my heart.<br> What's that one?<br> - What?<br> - That one, there. On your arm.<br> A tattoo. I got that removed.<br> Don't tell me. Don't tell me, "Mother."<br> What is it?<br> That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.<br> You were on the Indianapolis?<br> What happened?<br> Japanese submarine slammed<br> two torpedoes into her side, Chief.<br> I was comin' back<br> from the island of Tinian to Leyte...<br> ...just delivered the bomb,<br> the Hiroshima bomb.<br> Vessel went down in 12 minutes.<br> Didn't see the first shark<br> for about half an hour.<br> Tiger, 13-footer.<br> Know how you know that<br> when you're in the water?<br> You tell by lookin'<br> from the dorsal to the tail.<br> Well, we didn't know.<br> Because our bomb mission<br> had been so secret...<br> ...no distress signal had been sent.<br> They didn't even list us overdue<br> for a week.<br> Very first light, sharks come cruisin'...<br> ...so we formed ourselves<br> into tight groups.<br> Kinda like old squares in a battle<br> like you see on a calendar...<br> ...like the Battle of Waterloo.<br> The idea was,<br> the shark comes to the nearest man...<br> ...and he starts poundin'<br> hollerin' and screamin'.<br> Sometimes the shark would go away...<br> ...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.<br> Sometimes that shark,<br> he looks right into you...<br> ...right into your eyes.<br> You know, a thing about a shark, he's got...<br> ...lifeless eyes.<br> Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.<br> When he comes at you,<br> he doesn't seem to be livin'...<br> ...until he bites you.<br> Those little black eyes<br> roll over white and then...<br> ...then you hear<br> that terrible high-pitched screamin'.<br> The ocean turns red...<br> ...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin',<br> they all come in.<br> They rip you to pieces.<br> You know, by the end of that first dawn...<br> ...we lost 100 men.<br> I don't know how many sharks.<br> Maybe 1,000.<br> I don't know how many men,<br> they averaged six an hour.<br> On Thursday mornin',<br> I bumped into a friend of mine...<br> ...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.<br> Baseball player, Bosun's mate.<br> I thought he was asleep.<br> Reached over to wake him up.<br> He bobbed up and down<br> in the water just like a kind of top.<br> Upended.<br> He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.<br> Noon the fifth day,<br> a Lockheed Ventura saw us.<br> He swung in low and he saw us.<br> He was a young pilot.<br> Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...<br> ...and he came in low,<br> and three hours later...<br> ...a big fat PBY comes down<br> and starts to pick us up.<br> That was the time I was most frightened.<br> Waitin' for my turn.<br> I'll never put on a life jacket again.<br> So, 1,100 men went into the water...<br> ...316 men come out.<br> The sharks took the rest<br> June the 29th, 1945.<br> Anyway, we delivered the bomb.<br> What's that?<br> It's a whale.<br> "Farewell and adieu to you,<br> fair Spanish ladies<br> "Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain"<br> "Show me the way to go home<br> "I'm tired and I want to go to bed<br> "I had a little drink about an hour ago<br> "And it's gone right to my head<br> "Wherever I may roam<br> "By land, or sea, or foam<br> "Show me the way to go home<br> "I'm tired and I want to go to bed<br> "I had a little drink about a hour ago<br> "And it's gone right to my head<br> "Wherever I may roam<br> "On land or sea or foam<br> "You can always hear me singing this..."<br> Start the engines.<br> Fire her up!<br> Put out the fire, will ya?<br> - Pump her out.<br> - Done.<br> - Everybody on deck.<br> - He ate the light.<br> - Terrific.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Quint, what are you doing?<br> Don't waste your time.<br> What's wrong with this?<br> Hooper, take the wheel.<br> Brody, follow that. Watch for him.<br> You okay?<br> You okay?<br> More left rudder.<br> Pull your left hand down.<br> I can't. It'll only go about three inches.<br> All of our injectors got scored<br> from the salt water in the fuel.<br> Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.<br> Try the left rudder again. More left.<br> Good. Once again now.<br> There it is.<br> What do you say, Chief?<br> The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.<br> I think he's right under the keg.<br> Grab the boat hook.<br> If we can get close enough...<br> ...l've got things on board that'll kill it.<br> - Just want to goose him up. Come on.<br> When he runs, you drop that rope<br> or you'll lose your hands.<br> I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.<br> Whole sea's bones, full of 'em.<br> Give it to me a minute.<br> Haul in that line or it'll foul us.<br> Start the engine.<br> - Where are you goin'?<br> - I'm gonna make a phone call.<br> Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard?<br> Coast Guard, this is the Orca.<br> Do you read me?<br> Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you...<br> Excuse me, Chief.<br> That's great. That's just great.<br> Now, where the hell are we?<br> You're certifiable, Quint.<br> You know that? You're certifiable.<br> - You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this!<br> - Boys.<br> I think he's come back for his noon feeding.<br> Hook me up another barrel.<br> Bring her around after him.<br> Full throttle.<br> Get me right up alongside of him.<br> I can't rev it up that high,<br> it's not gonna take it.<br> Five degrees port.<br> All right, hold your course.<br> Five degrees port now.<br> Hold your course.<br> - Fast fish.<br> - Watch my hand.<br> Be sure you watch my hand.<br> Follow me. Follow me.<br> Lad, you watch him now.<br> Starboard. Starboard.<br> Run him down.<br> Hard apart.<br> Watch him.<br> Starboard.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Two barrels and he's going down again.<br> It's incredible.<br> - They're up again!<br> - Now what?<br> Why don't we lead the shark into shore<br> instead of him leading us out to sea?<br> Grab a couple of poles.<br> Hang on now, we're going around.<br> Into starboard. Easy.<br> I'm gonna back her off now.<br> Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.<br> All right, gentlemen, snag them.<br> Now then tie them to the stern cleats.<br> Brody, bring your end around the cleat.<br> That's right, it'll lock itself off.<br> Give him room, Brody.<br> Stay clear of the line.<br> Watch it. Stand clear.<br> Stand away from those stern cleats.<br> Back home we got a taxidermy man.<br> He gonna have a heart attack<br> when he sees what I brought him.<br> Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.<br> My God, this one, too. They're both going.<br> - He's eating his way through that line.<br> - He's working his way right up to us.<br> Come on, Quint. Hurry!<br> Out of my way.<br> Watch it.<br> Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.<br> Make it fast.<br> I can't. It's trying to run.<br> Pull, you son of a bitch!<br> Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.<br> It's impossible!<br> We're breaking up! Cut it!<br> Watch your hands!<br> Cut it quick. I can't hold it!<br> He can't stay down<br> with three barrels on him.<br> Not with three barrels, he can't.<br> What about us?<br> Get the pump out of the locker<br> in front of you, will you?<br> We're gonna sink, aren't we?<br> Keep an eye on the barrels.<br> Pump it out, Chief.<br> Starting to go under.<br> He can't with three barrels on him.<br> Not with three he can't.<br> You ever have one do this before?<br> No.<br> He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.<br> I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.<br> Draw him into the shallow water.<br> I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.<br> - We're headin' in, Brody.<br> - Thank Christ!<br> - You ever had a great white do that?<br> - No.<br> How far do we have to go?<br> Don't put that much pressure on it.<br> - Goddamn it.<br> - Shut up. Get back there.<br> Hold on.<br> "Farewell and adieu to you,<br> fair Spanish ladies<br> "Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain<br> "For we received order<br> for to sail back to Boston"<br> You idiot, you burned out the bearings.<br> All right stop the boat. Stop the boat.<br> Stop it.<br> What exactly can you do<br> with these things of yours?<br> I think I can pump 20 ccm<br> of strychnine nitrate into him.<br> If I can get close enough.<br> Get this little needle through his skin?<br> No, I can't do that.<br> If I can get him close to the cage,<br> I can get him in the mouth.<br> - That shark'll rip that cage to pieces.<br> - You got any better suggestions?<br> Easy.<br> Up she goes.<br> Ain't got no spit.<br> Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.<br> Okay, okay, I'm ready.<br> Bring him up, goddamn it.<br> Bring him up now!<br> Pull it up. Pull it.<br> Come on, Quint, bring him in.<br> It's giving way.<br> Rig something!<br> Got it?<br> It's comin'.<br> Slower.<br> Show me the tank.<br> Blow up!<br> Smile, you son of a bitch!<br> Quint?<br> No.<br> Can we get in on those?<br> What day is this?<br> It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think.<br> I think the tide's with us.<br> Keep kicking.<br> I used to hate the water.<br> I can't imagine why.<br>
