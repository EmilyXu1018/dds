                        Boy, stop here.<br> Might as well get us a ball.<br> Julie will have plenty<br> to drink at the party.<br> Party liquor. Messed up<br> with cherries and such. Come on.<br> - Wait right here.<br> - Yes, sir, Mr. Cantrell, sir.<br> Man, you talk crazy.<br> I say that horse is<br> out of the Truxton strain.<br> - Gentlemen.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - How are you, General Bogardus, sir?<br> - How are you, Buck? Ted?<br> - Going to the party?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> - See you later then, sir.<br> - Yes.<br> The Truxton strain's<br> the best horse blood in this state.<br> Here's somebody<br> that really knows bloodlines.<br> Hi, Buck Cantrell.<br> Come here and help us decide a bet.<br> Got no time, Huger.<br> Ted and I were just shifting.<br> Won't take any time at all, Buck.<br> You heard him, Huger.<br> Buck got no time.<br> Gentlemen, Buck Cantrell got no time.<br> Five-to-four, he doesn't know the day.<br> I'll do better. Even money,<br> he doesn't know what month.<br> Know what time of day it is, anyhow.<br> Must be getting on towards 3:00.<br> If it was any later,<br> De Lautruc would be a lot drunker.<br> Is it not admirable Monsieur Cantrell<br> can joke so cleverly...<br> ...when he has just lost<br> the lady of his heart?<br> - Better not, Rene.<br> - Yes, gentlemen.<br> Monsieur Cantrell<br> has just lost his lady.<br> I wouldn't go on, De Lautruc.<br> See, gentlemen,<br> Monsieur Cantrell is in bad humor...<br> ...because Julie Marsden is marrying...<br> - De Lautruc.<br> I thought I heard you mention<br> a lady's name.<br> Must have misunderstood you, sir.<br> And if I did mention<br> the name of a lady?<br> Why, just that a gentleman doesn't<br> mention a lady's name in a barroom.<br> Are you trying<br> to teach me manners, my friend?<br> Wouldn't think of trying, De Lautruc.<br> But I somehow don't like your hat<br> or your ears or anything between them.<br> - Plain enough?<br> - Amply, sir. Pierre?<br> I've the honor to ask you<br> to name a friend.<br> - I'm acting as...<br> - Shoot, Ted.<br> You're too young<br> for this sort of thing.<br> Gentlemen, a moment.<br> Buck, I ought to get De Lautruc myself.<br> It's my brother that's gonna marry her.<br> That makes it much more<br> my quarrel than yours.<br> - Let me act for you, Buck.<br> - Well, if you feel that bad about it.<br> I've the honor<br> to be acting for Mr. Cantrell.<br> - Sunrise at the Oaks satisfactory?<br> - Perfectly, sir.<br> Why do you wanna make it<br> so confounded early?<br> Make it 10:00. De Lautruc ain't wild.<br> We don't have to sneak up<br> on him in the dark.<br> Your servant, gentlemen.<br> Come on, youngster.<br> We gotta get on to the party.<br> Gentlemen, let's have another drink.<br> Buck, listen...<br> Here's something<br> I've been aiming to get all day.<br> - Must have trimmings for the party.<br> - Cantrell, one minute.<br> - You riding along with us?<br> - I have my carriage.<br> Cantrell, I don't like this.<br> Miss Julie's name was mentioned.<br> As her guardian,<br> I don't like her mixed up in this.<br> Miss Julie's name was mentioned?<br> Why, sir, if it was, I never heard it.<br> It's just that I don't<br> like De Lautruc, is all. May I?<br> Cantrell, you're a fool. De Lautruc's<br> an old hand. Been out a dozen times.<br> Thirteen's liable to be<br> unlucky for De Lautruc.<br> You know these French. They shoot<br> for the head and like as not, miss.<br> I'm gonna shoot for the body<br> and bust his tripes.<br> General Bogardus, sir, your servant.<br> Mrs. Kendrick. Miss Kendrick, ma'am.<br> - Keep in the shade, Albert.<br> - Yes, Mrs. Kendrick, ma'am.<br> I won't have the horses<br> standing in the sun, you hear?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Stay in your seat.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Keep your hat and gloves on.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - And your coat buttoned.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Mrs. Kendrick, ma'am.<br> - Good evening, Cato.<br> Miss Kendrick.<br> - Honoria, how good of you to come.<br> - Sweet of you to ask us, Belle.<br> And, Stephanie,<br> how pretty you look, child.<br> Oh, thank you, Miss Massie.<br> Stephanie, your manners.<br> - I do hope we aren't late, Belle.<br> - Late? Julie isn't here herself yet.<br> - What?<br> - At her own party in her own house.<br> Really, I don't know<br> what to do with that girl.<br> Well, I always say,<br> "Better late than never."<br> Excuse me, please, Honoria.<br> Mother, please don't fault me<br> like that before people.<br> Girls don't curtsey anymore.<br> - I read it in Godey's.<br> - They do in New Orleans.<br> You've no call to take up<br> with Yankee manners.<br> - How do you find yourself, Mrs. Petion?<br> - Honoria, Stephanie.<br> Belle just told me Julie is late<br> for her own party in her own house.<br> But I always say,<br> "Punctuality is the politeness of kings."<br> Politeness was never<br> one of Julie's virtues.<br> Ted, isn't it exciting?<br> I think your brother Pres<br> is the luckiest man.<br> Providing he keeps<br> a short reign on her.<br> Oh, you're just trying to talk<br> like Buck Cantrell.<br> I wish Julie would come.<br> So does Aunt Belle.<br> She's having a fit.<br> Tell me, wasn't Mr. Cantrell<br> just crushed?<br> Crushed? Buck Cantrell?<br> Hounds all over him. Tom with<br> his knife, high-tailing with a bear.<br> The only way you could tell<br> which was which, he had a hat on.<br> Laugh, I thought I...<br> - Yes, Miss Belle?<br> - Theophilus, that child isn't here yet.<br> You're her guardian.<br> You'll have to speak to her.<br> You're her aunt, Miss Belle.<br> Why don't you?<br> - Girl never was on time in her life.<br> - It's outrageous of her.<br> Oh, time ain't so important, Miss Belle.<br> Seems like the longer I live,<br> the more there is of it.<br> And I don't know<br> what to say to people.<br> Evening, Miss Julie.<br> Thank you, Gros Bat.<br> Take him around, Ti Bat.<br> Now, Ti Bat, don't stand there<br> with your eyes bulging out like that.<br> - He knows you're scared.<br> - Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie, but he bite.<br> Well, then you just plain<br> bite him back.<br> - Good evening, Uncle Cato.<br> - Praise be, Miss Julie.<br> - Miss Belle's been nigh on to a fit.<br> - I know, I'm late.<br> Miss Julie, I done laid out<br> your party dress.<br> Thanks. No time.<br> Got to go in to my guests.<br> - Miss Julie, in them horse clothes?<br> - They won't mind.<br> Good evening, everybody.<br> Terribly sorry to be late.<br> I had trouble with the colt.<br> - Hello, dumpling.<br> - Julie, your riding habit.<br> No time to change, darling. Stephanie.<br> - I think it looks lovely.<br> - Thank you, honey.<br> - How are you, Ted?<br> - Fine as frog's hair.<br> Good evening. Good evening.<br> How do you do?<br> So sorry, but when a colt<br> gets high-headed...<br> ...teach him his manners<br> or ruin him.<br> - Yes, that's so important, isn't it?<br> - Hello, Molly. Excuse me, will you?<br> I declare. I hope I'm broad-minded,<br> but I must say...<br> I know what Stephanie would get<br> if she did such a thing, big as she is.<br> I always say, "Spare the rod<br> and you spoil the child."<br> It sounds so thrilling, darling,<br> living way up North in New York.<br> Julie, I wish you and Pres<br> all the happiness...<br> ...the best of health...<br> - And the most of prosperity.<br> Sherry, ma'am?<br> You said the very same thing<br> the last time Pres and I were engaged.<br> We'll keep right on saying it<br> until you finally get married.<br> My dear, the toddies<br> are for the gentlemen.<br> - Whiskey, Uncle Billy?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - The very best of Bourbon.<br> - That's fine.<br> To the very good health<br> of the future Mrs. Dillard.<br> Buck.<br> Aren't you gonna wish me<br> happiness too?<br> What's the use? You won't get it<br> marrying a trader and going up North.<br> Pres is a banker, not a trader.<br> I'll thank you to remember that.<br> I keep forgetting there's a difference.<br> But you won't like it in the North,<br> Miss Julie, tell you what.<br> - I'll be happy anywhere Pres is.<br> - You won't like it at the North.<br> You know those little old white beans?<br> Horse-feed beans?<br> You know what they<br> do with them in Boston?<br> They eat them. Ladies and gentlemen<br> eat them, what I hear.<br> - Buck, you're...<br> - My dear.<br> Isn't Preston Dillard<br> ever going to arrive?<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Kendrick,<br> I tried to persuade him...<br> ...but he found it important<br> to meet with the directors of his bank.<br> Of course.<br> "Business before pleasure," I always say.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I give you a toast.<br> To the firm of Dillard and Sons,<br> a venerable institution...<br> ...a financial colossus<br> with branches in New York...<br> ...Boston, London and Paris.<br> I guess the one railroad we got<br> is not enough, huh?<br> Let's see what it does<br> before we finance another.<br> It's losing money by the fistful,<br> that's what.<br> Steam cars. Ten million dollars<br> to mess with another railroad.<br> Who's gonna ride on them?<br> All joggled up with any kind<br> of rag-tagging bobtail?<br> What's a gentleman<br> keep a carriage for?<br> What if a gentleman<br> ain't got a carriage?<br> He can borrow one.<br> What's he got friends for?<br> Gentlemen. Gentlemen.<br> We are here to listen<br> to Mr. Dillard's plans...<br> ...to finance the Nashville Pacific.<br> Pacific, and build it east.<br> When they gonna ask you<br> to build a railroad to California?<br> Gentlemen, I'm a banker,<br> not a conjure man.<br> But I can tell you this:<br> New York and Boston are steadily<br> laying in rails to the Northwest.<br> They're tapping<br> the trade of that country.<br> Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati,<br> the whole Great Lakes country...<br> ...beginning to ship east by rail.<br> - And New Orleans is missing the parade.<br> - The river's still there.<br> I reckon even those<br> Yankee sharpers aren't smart enough...<br> ...to turn the Mississippi around.<br> Yankees sharpers are smart enough<br> to turn the traffic around.<br> The railroads are getting it.<br> Cussed, snorting, tin teakettles.<br> Scaring my horses.<br> Every time we get a colt, I look for him<br> to be foaled with a whale-oil headlight.<br> I do not think they're so healthy too.<br> All that smoke and...<br> Since when have you become so suddenly<br> concerned about what's healthy?<br> He's off again.<br> You're old enough to remember<br> the epidemic of '30.<br> - Or are you so old you've forgotten it?<br> - I knew it.<br> Quick as anybody said "health"...<br> ...Doc Livingstone come surging out of<br> the cane-break, hollering, "Yellow jack."<br> And I'll keep on hollering<br> till you do something...<br> ...about cleaning up this town,<br> getting the filth off the streets.<br> I've been trying to pound sense<br> into your knotheads for years.<br> Just the same as Pres is trying to do<br> right now, and with no better luck.<br> But I'm warning you,<br> and you, Jean La Cour...<br> ...member of the City Counsel,<br> and all of you...<br> ...if we get us another dose of<br> yellow fever like we had back in '30...<br> ...when there wasn't enough men alive<br> to bury the dead...<br> ...there just isn't going to be any town<br> to run a railroad into.<br> I'm telling you what's a fact.<br> Dr. Livingstone,<br> let us not confuse the issue.<br> We are here to discuss a railroad.<br> Mr. Dillard.<br> Gentlemen, I have here the figures<br> on the declining river freight.<br> These figures don't lie.<br> Last year, our riverboat...<br> - Yes?<br> - It's Miss Julie's boy, sir.<br> - He insists to see you, sir.<br> - What does he want?<br> He insists that Miss Julie told him<br> to see you personally, sir.<br> One moment, please, gentlemen.<br> The lady's waiting, sir.<br> - Is the party over?<br> - Yes, Mr. Pres.<br> Miss Julie tell me to ask you...<br> ...would you most politely drop<br> what you're doing and come?<br> You tell her I'm in the middle<br> of something important.<br> Directors' meeting. I can't leave now.<br> She'll understand.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.<br> She'll understand, all right.<br> But liking it is gonna be different.<br> And expecting a man<br> to go to a dressmaker's with you.<br> I declare, I hope Pres doesn't come.<br> - He will.<br> - But, Julie...<br> Now, don't fret about Pres.<br> I've been training him for years.<br> Not with that man-killing<br> horse you bought.<br> Pres was outrageous.<br> He'd no right to tell me<br> what I could ride and couldn't.<br> Horse showed you<br> what you couldn't.<br> You broke your collarbone<br> and your engagement.<br> And they both mended,<br> so I was right after all.<br> - Miss Julie, ma'am.<br> - Ti Bat, did you tell him to hurry?<br> Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie. I tell him.<br> But he ain't come.<br> That is, not just exactly.<br> That is, he say,<br> will you please go along?<br> In the middle of some directions.<br> Causes some problems.<br> He can't see you later.<br> Did Mr. Pres say that?<br> Yes, ma'am, those his very words.<br> He says you'll understand.<br> - Yes. Yes, I understand perfectly.<br> - Julie.<br> Julie, in a bank.<br> I'll get him, Miss Julie. I'll get him.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Just a moment.<br> I'm not putting the bank<br> in a $ 10 million proposition...<br> ...without knowing<br> what I'm talking about.<br> I haven't spent six months getting<br> these figures for my album.<br> - Give me a little...<br> - Mr. Dillard, sir.<br> - Yes, what is it?<br> - It's Miss Julie, sir. She's waiting.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Certainly, my boy.<br> Everything waits<br> where beauty's concerned.<br> - You shouldn't...<br> - Are you coming or aren't you?<br> - Try to understand.<br> - I only understand that you promised.<br> - But this is important.<br> - I don't suppose it's important...<br> ...that I spent a whole month<br> having my ball dress made.<br> You promised to come and see it fitted.<br> I don't suppose it's important to you<br> what I wear to the Olympus ball.<br> It's only you that's so important.<br> I suppose Mr. La Cour and the others<br> couldn't possibly get on without you.<br> They'd love to, permanently.<br> - Now, Julie, you've got good sense.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm having the fight of my life in there.<br> I've gotta get back.<br> Just run along, I'll see you later.<br> Don't trouble.<br> I'm sure you'll be too exhausted<br> from your terrific struggle.<br> - Julie, you must realize...<br> - I realize only too well.<br> Good day, Mr. Dillard.<br> I'm so sorry to have troubled you.<br> To Madame Poulard's.<br> - Julie, it's perfectly lovely.<br> - I don't like the color.<br> And does it have to be so tight here?<br> - It binds. And the skirt...<br> - But it's adorable, Julie. It really is.<br> - Pres has always loved you in white.<br> - Yes.<br> If he isn't bowled over,<br> I won't know what to think.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Bring that over here.<br> - Saucy, isn't it?<br> - And vulgar.<br> Yes, isn't it?<br> - Come on. Get me out of this.<br> - Julie, what are you doing?<br> If it fits me, I'm gonna wear it<br> to the Olympus ball.<br> A red dress to the Olympus ball?<br> Why, you're out of your senses.<br> That creature, Julie.<br> You heard what Madame Poulard said.<br> - That infamous Vickers woman.<br> - Marie Vickers couldn't do it justice.<br> Child, you're out of your mind.<br> You know you can't wear red<br> to the Olympus ball.<br> Can't I? I'm going to.<br> This is 1852, dumpling.<br> Girls don't have to simper around<br> in white because they're not married.<br> In New Orleans, they do.<br> Julie, you'd insult every woman<br> on the floor.<br> Mademoiselle, your aunt, she's right.<br> Look how beautiful this dress is.<br> Will you kindly get me out of this?<br> Julie, you can't be serious.<br> Never more serious in my life.<br> But, Julie, think of Pres.<br> That's just exactly<br> what I am thinking of.<br> Preston, I'm not convinced,<br> but I consider, I think.<br> - Gentlemen, bon soir.<br> - Evening, La Cour.<br> Well, cheer up, son.<br> You've got La Cour to thinking anyhow.<br> That, my boy, is as good<br> as starting a balky mule.<br> - It took your support, doctor.<br> - Nonsense.<br> I'd always be with Tom Dillard's son,<br> right or wrong.<br> Best man I ever knew.<br> Don't breed men like that nowadays.<br> You measured right up to him<br> this afternoon.<br> I'm afraid not, doctor.<br> You been having you<br> some little fuss with Miss Julie?<br> - If you don't mind, sir.<br> - Certainly, my boy.<br> None of my business anyhow.<br> But speaking abstractly,<br> and nothing personal intended...<br> ...your generation<br> don't understand the darlings.<br> - Why, maybe not.<br> - Absolutely not, my boy.<br> Woman, sir, is a chalice...<br> ...a frail, delicate chalice,<br> to be cherished and protected.<br> But nowadays, no proper respect<br> for our Southern womanhood.<br> Think your father would<br> have allowed his lady...<br> ...to come surging<br> into his place of business?<br> What would he have done, sir?<br> He'd have cut him a hickory, sir.<br> A hickory.<br> He'd have flailed<br> the living daylights out of her...<br> ...and then helped put lard on her welts<br> and bought her a diamond brooch.<br> That's what he'd have done, sir,<br> and she'd have loved it.<br> Good evening, my boy.<br> Thank you, doctor. Good evening, sir.<br> - Evening, Mr. Preston.<br> - Hello, Cato. Is Miss Julie about?<br> She's up to her room, sir.<br> I'll tell her you're here.<br> Just rest yourself in there<br> with the folks.<br> Thanks, Uncle Cato.<br> - Evening.<br> - Pres, I'm so glad you've come.<br> I thought you...<br> Julie said you'd quarreled again.<br> It's time we all stopped<br> hanging on every word she says.<br> Most times,<br> she only half means them.<br> I was telling your aunt<br> the same thing. That girl...<br> She just had a little fuss with Pres.<br> That's all, isn't it, Pres?<br> If you can call it a fuss, Miss Belle.<br> - You see, Theophilus?<br> - I'm going to speak out.<br> That girl is high-headed and willful.<br> Son, if you just come to realize it,<br> what she needs is a firm hand.<br> I appreciate your interest,<br> but I believe I can handle this.<br> Mr. Preston, Miss Julie say,<br> will you most politely excuse her?<br> - Is she ill?<br> - Why, no, Pres.<br> She's sound as a nut.<br> - Excuse me a moment.<br> - Take your own good time, my boy.<br> Now, Belle.<br> Julie?<br> Julie, it's Pres.<br> Open the door. I want to talk to you.<br> Julie, why don't you answer?<br> Look here, Julie, you and I<br> have got to straighten things out.<br> There's no sense to all this.<br> I'm here because I love you<br> and because I know you love me...<br> ...but there are some things<br> we've got to see straight.<br> Julie, I couldn't leave the bank today,<br> you know that.<br> I was just as disappointed<br> as you were.<br> Now, please, Julie.<br> We've always had these silly quarrels.<br> Can't we stop?<br> Julie? Why don't you answer?<br> Darling, if you'll just open the door,<br> I'm sure I could...<br> Julie!<br> Open this door.<br> Julie!<br> Julie!<br> Who is it?<br> Open this door.<br> Why, Pres. Banging on a lady's door.<br> I'm scandalized at you.<br> Well, did you come up here<br> just to stand there?<br> Julie, how long must<br> we go on like this?<br> Like what, Pres?<br> Fighting, fussing all the time<br> like a couple of children.<br> Why do you treat me like a child?<br> Because you act like one.<br> A spoiled one.<br> You used to say<br> you liked me like that, once.<br> You never wanted me to change.<br> Remember?<br> Julie.<br> Why, Pres. In a lady's bedroom.<br> - Now you'll have to marry me.<br> - What do you figure I aim to do?<br> Then kiss me again.<br> - Would you like to see my new dress?<br> - That's what I wanted to do all day.<br> Well... Well, let me go, then.<br> There it is.<br> - For the Olympus ball?<br> - Isn't it lovely?<br> - Julie, it's red.<br> - It's gorgeously red.<br> - You can't wear red to the Olympus ball.<br> - Why not?<br> You never saw an unmarried girl<br> in anything but white.<br> And you're gonna see one<br> tomorrow night.<br> Julie, you can't be serious.<br> You afraid somebody will take me<br> for a girl from Gallatin Street?<br> - Julie!<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I forgot, I'm a child.<br> I'm not supposed to know about<br> things like Gallatin Street.<br> I'm supposed<br> to flutter around in white.<br> You're supposed to know better<br> than to scandalize the whole town.<br> It might be bad for the bank.<br> Of course.<br> Will you please hold another meeting<br> and ask them to decide what I can wear?<br> For heaven's sake,<br> will you be reasonable?<br> - Were you reasonable this afternoon?<br> - So that's it.<br> You're just nursing a spite.<br> Well, I'm not gonna let you.<br> You've made your point.<br> For once, you're gonna do as I say.<br> I'm calling for you<br> tomorrow night at 10...<br> ...and you're gonna be dressed<br> properly in white.<br> Am I?<br> Oh, but, of course, Preston,<br> if you say so.<br> Don't be absurd.<br> Your own good sense will say so.<br> And if it doesn't?<br> Then, my sweet, you and I will sit<br> at home quietly with our embroidery.<br> Good night.<br> Tomorrow night at 10.<br> Oh, Preston, you forgot your stick.<br> So I did. I forgot to use it too.<br> So you did.<br> - Did you call me, Miss Julie?<br> - Yes, Zette. I've got an errand for you.<br> - I'd rather not trust the others.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Miss Julie, this sure<br> is the most elegant dress.<br> You can have it after tomorrow.<br> - Me, Miss Julie?<br> - If you can keep a secret.<br> It's just like<br> you ain't never said nothing.<br> Zette, I want this delivered right away<br> to Mr. Buck Cantrell on Chartres Street.<br> And, Zette, remember,<br> not a word to anyone, understand?<br> I sure do understand, Miss Julie.<br> It's just like I was struck stone dumb<br> in both my ears.<br> Well, go on.<br> Zette. Zette, when Mr. Pres comes,<br> give him this.<br> Give him this, Miss Julie?<br> Just give it to him. He'll understand.<br> Yes, Miss Julie, ma'am.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Evening, Miss Julie.<br> You're late.<br> Sorry, I had a little business<br> to attend to.<br> Is it true about Mr. De Lautruc?<br> Don't you suppose<br> I know about the meeting?<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> - Is it true you killed him?<br> Sure. I never did him that bad.<br> Dr. Livingstone,<br> he had him an elegant name for it:<br> A fractured...<br> Well, anyway, it just looked<br> like a busted hip to me.<br> My zing, Miss Julie,<br> you all dressed up for a hog killing?<br> I hoped you'd like it.<br> Well, makes me feel kind of all-overish.<br> Well, your note said 10:00,<br> side entrance, Miss Julie.<br> What you up to?<br> Buck, you're taking me<br> to the Olympus ball.<br> - You do me a great honor.<br> - Then we'd better hurry.<br> Just a minute.<br> You had a set-to with Pres?<br> - I'd rather not discuss it.<br> - We'd better. Pres isn't gonna like it.<br> What's the matter, Buck?<br> Afraid Pres will call you out?<br> He'd do that.<br> Can't say I'd blame him much.<br> Where do I stand, carrying his lady?<br> - If I ask you to, isn't that enough?<br> - Not this time, Miss Julie.<br> I think too much of you<br> to help do something you'll regret.<br> - I know exactly what I'm doing.<br> - Most likely you do, but you're wrong.<br> That dress can cause<br> no end of trouble.<br> Folks will resent you<br> coming to the ball in it.<br> Well, let them. They're just petty<br> and narrow-minded.<br> No, ma'am, it's just that they got rules<br> and they go by them. Same as you and I.<br> - And do you prefer to go by your rules?<br> - I always have, Miss Julie.<br> Then I'm sorry I troubled you.<br> - Good night, Mr. Cantrell.<br> - Good night, Miss Julie.<br> - Good evening, Uncle Cato.<br> - Evening, Mr. Pres.<br> - Evening, Pres.<br> - Evening. Julie dressed?<br> Zette, tell Miss Julie Mr. Pres is here.<br> We're ready to go.<br> Well, don't stand there like a bump<br> on a log. Go along and tell her.<br> Yes, Miss Belle, ma'am.<br> Zette.<br> Good evening.<br> Well, shall we go, Pres?<br> Not till you're properly dressed.<br> You're sure it's the dress?<br> It couldn't be that you're afraid?<br> Afraid somebody will insult me and<br> you'll find it necessary to defend me?<br> May I?<br> - Ready, Aunt Belle?<br> - Pres, please...<br> We're ready, my boy.<br> ...that dress.<br> Hello, Molly.<br> Mrs. Kendrick. Hello, Dick.<br> - Miss Julie.<br> - Evening, Julie.<br> Stephanie, we must pay our respects<br> to Mrs. Zemal. You'll excuse us, please.<br> Gentlemen, you all have the privilege<br> of Miss Marsden's acquaintance, I think.<br> - Gentlemen.<br> - Good evening, Miss Marsden.<br> - Respects, ma'am.<br> - Good evening, Buck.<br> We were just fixing<br> to pour us a little libation.<br> That's right.<br> - Shall we see you later?<br> - Excuse me.<br> Oh, there's my partner now.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> You haven't a partner<br> you have to meet, Cantrell.<br> Why, no. Came alone.<br> A pleasant evening, isn't it?<br> Mighty pleasant.<br> Nice and cool.<br> Do you find it cool in here?<br> I don't find it particularly cool.<br> - Do you, Julie?<br> - Why... Why, no.<br> I don't find it particularly cool.<br> Miss Julie doesn't find it so.<br> Why, no.<br> Now you speak of it,<br> it's just about right.<br> It seems so to me.<br> Your servant.<br> Yours, Miss Julie.<br> Pres, I wanna leave.<br> Why? We haven't danced yet.<br> - Shall we?<br> - No.<br> Pres, let me go.<br> Take me out of here.<br> Go on and play.<br> Go on and play.<br> Pres, let me go.<br> Please take me out of here.<br> Good night, Aunt Belle.<br> Goodbye, Julie.<br> Is that all you've got to say to me?<br> There's nothing more to say.<br> Evidently you've made up your mind.<br> No, Julie. You've made up my mind.<br> Goodbye, Pres.<br> Goodbye, Julie.<br> Julie, don't let him go. Call him back.<br> Julie, you're a fool.<br> Not such a fool.<br> - He'll come back.<br> - He won't.<br> Not this time, he won't. Believe me.<br> Julie, honey, let me send for him.<br> No, he'll come back. Wait and see.<br> Yet tonight, I think.<br> If he does, say I've retired.<br> And that I'm sleeping late<br> in the morning.<br> Not to come around<br> till afternoon tomorrow.<br> Tell him to...<br> Huger's got himself a brand-new reason<br> for getting liquored.<br> Straight bourbon and lots of it.<br> That's a fact.<br> Ever hear of a man<br> and his liquor getting yellow fever?<br> I aim to carry all I can hold, and I<br> advise you gentlemen to do likewise.<br> Huger aims not to be carried off<br> by anything but drink.<br> It's no joking matter.<br> Looks mighty serious.<br> More cases than you hear about.<br> Doctors call it by another name,<br> any name but yellow fever.<br> Every time I see old dead wagon,<br> I pour me four fingers of bourbon.<br> Yesterday, I drunk<br> nigh on to two quarts.<br> Ain't any more yellow fever<br> than this time last year.<br> You never hear of fever talk<br> in racing season.<br> Folks got something better<br> to talk about.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Dillard.<br> How you, Ted?<br> - Something working on your mind.<br> - Pres is coming back.<br> Why, now, folks generally do.<br> - When did you hear this?<br> - Just now, from Dr. Livingstone.<br> He's bringing something rare<br> and precious from the North.<br> - What could it be, I wonder?<br> - A stem-winding watch, maybe.<br> And give yourselves a breathing spell<br> up there on the plantation.<br> Only a matter of a few weeks, I say,<br> until the scare blows over.<br> You'll be back in time<br> for the Mardi Gras and Olympus ball.<br> Is there really cause for alarm?<br> Well, I wouldn't go so far as that, but<br> the city's not going to be so pleasant.<br> No parties. Theater's liable to be closed<br> as a precautionary measure.<br> The theater.<br> I haven't been since...<br> - When was the last time, Aunt Belle?<br> - Camille.<br> I hated it. I wouldn't mind<br> if I never saw another play.<br> I strongly urge you go.<br> Who knows? Maybe we are in<br> for another time like '30.<br> Heaven forbid.<br> Dr. Livingstone's only looking after<br> our best interests, I'm sure, my dear.<br> I am indeed.<br> May I send instructions<br> to have the house made ready?<br> I'll try to persuade her,<br> Dr. Livingstone.<br> Julie don't look<br> as well as I've seen her.<br> It's all I can do to get her<br> to step from this house.<br> Won't go outside except to ride<br> that crazy thoroughbred of hers.<br> I'm in fear and trembling<br> she'll break her neck.<br> Won't go anyplace where there's<br> company. Won't have company in.<br> Young Mr. Cantrell and the others,<br> she hasn't received them in months.<br> They've stopped calling.<br> Only leave cards.<br> What does she do all day long?<br> Tends the house as no house<br> has ever been tended.<br> She's so particular, if an article<br> is half an inch out of place...<br> ...or if there's a speck of dust<br> on anything, she notices it.<br> Makes me uneasy.<br> You might be interested<br> in a bit of news I got today.<br> Preston Dillard's coming back.<br> Arrives Friday on the packet.<br> - What brings him?<br> - This yellow-fever business.<br> We two stand together<br> on what ought to be done about it.<br> Now it's busted loose,<br> he's coming back.<br> It's high time.<br> I suspect I know Julie<br> like nobody ever will...<br> ...every crook and cranny of her.<br> You ought to, Miss Belle.<br> She's more like you than you ever were.<br> Maybe I love her most<br> when she's her meanest...<br> ...because I know<br> that's when she's loving most.<br> I'll let you know about the plantation<br> just as soon as I can.<br> Do that, Miss Belle,<br> if you please, ma'am.<br> Don't bother, Miss Belle.<br> - Goodbye, Cato.<br> - Evening, Dr. Livingstone, sir.<br> I do believe Dr. Livingstone<br> takes pleasure in frightening people.<br> - Particularly women.<br> - You don't remember the last outbreak.<br> It was dreadful.<br> I guess it's pretty serious.<br> Pres Dillard's coming home<br> on account of it.<br> Pres is coming home.<br> Of course.<br> Did you know it?<br> Certainly, I knew it.<br> I knew all along.<br> He had to come back to me.<br> He couldn't help himself.<br> He wouldn't know<br> how to fight as hard as I have...<br> ...to keep from going to him.<br> We'll be married.<br> I'm gonna beg his forgiveness.<br> I was vicious, mean and selfish.<br> And I'm gonna tell him I hated myself<br> for being like I was, even then.<br> I'll humble myself before him.<br> And everything that ever stood<br> between us will be gone...<br> ...when he takes me in his arms.<br> Darling.<br> Perhaps we'd better go<br> to the plantation.<br> Of course, that's the place<br> for our meeting.<br> We'd better start packing.<br> Uncle Cato. Zette.<br> We'll give a party, dumpling.<br> We'll invite everybody.<br> A party to celebrate.<br> Uncle Cato, get the trunks<br> out of the attic.<br> And, Zette, lay out my dresses.<br> And have Gros Bat<br> polish up the big carriage.<br> Have Mammy Teel pack a basket.<br> And get the furniture covers out,<br> we're closing the house.<br> What are you standing there for?<br> Get a move on. We're going to Halcyon.<br> - You guess that's plenty, Uncle Cato?<br> - I guess so, Miss Julie.<br> If all that mint sticks in the juleps,<br> it's bound to be a powerful night.<br> Now, don't you forget a hard frost<br> on the glasses.<br> Miss Julie, when I ever serve<br> a gentleman a julep without the frost?<br> Mr. Pres sure gonna know<br> he's back home, all right.<br> You finish it, will you?<br> Zette, run a damp cloth over my mirror<br> and lay out my dress.<br> - I'll be up in a minute.<br> - Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.<br> - Zette.<br> - Yes?<br> - Is Gros Bat on the lookout?<br> - Yes, Miss Julie.<br> You're gonna wear those flowers out<br> with fixing and fussing.<br> Everything's got to be right, dumpling.<br> Just right.<br> Well, I guess everything is.<br> And you most of anything, honey.<br> - Excited?<br> - Feel my heart jumping?<br> Well, I guess I better go and dress.<br> Zette. Zette, help me out of this.<br> Did you hear a carriage?<br> Go on, Zette, see. Hurry.<br> Do you see any carriages just yet?<br> - No carriage coming yet.<br> - Nope, no carriages coming yet.<br> - Yes?<br> - No carriages yet.<br> Well, then hook me up, Zette.<br> Why you ain't never wear<br> this dress before, Miss Julie?<br> It's the most prettiest dress you own.<br> - I've been saving it for today.<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't never have no hopes<br> of falling heir to this dress, I don't.<br> No, not this one, Zette.<br> Carriages coming!<br> - Where?<br> - Carriages coming, down yonder.<br> - Carriages coming!<br> - Carriages coming!<br> - Carriages coming!<br> - Zette.<br> - Man on horseback too.<br> - Zette, yes.<br> - Carriages coming.<br> - Carriages coming.<br> - Carriages coming.<br> - Carriages coming.<br> Carriages coming.<br> Carriages coming.<br> - Glad to see you.<br> - I'm so glad to see you.<br> Mr. Buck and Mr. Dick<br> are on horseback.<br> - Keep an eye out for Mr. Pres.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Buck, I'm glad to see you.<br> - Hello.<br> Will you all go in<br> and just sort of carry on, right?<br> Go on and make yourselves at home.<br> Dick, I'm so glad.<br> Before it was a pleasure to be here,<br> but this time it's a blessing.<br> Yes, ma'am. I'm sure glad<br> to see you all back again.<br> I guess there's no use<br> my telling you folks...<br> ...how glad we are to have you here.<br> Miss Belle, I reckon none of us ever<br> could forget the hospitality of Halcyon.<br> Now, you stay out of my kitchen.<br> I haven't forgotten the time<br> you ate my party pompano.<br> Sure. Miss Julie and me,<br> we'd been bird hunting.<br> We were hungry,<br> and there was an elegant pompano.<br> Well, you were both of you<br> mighty reprehensible.<br> - Have you heard from Preston?<br> - No, but I had a note from Ted.<br> He said Pres would arrive<br> on the packet about noon.<br> He'd be responsible<br> for bringing him over.<br> They ought to be here by now.<br> Have to wait for the sheriff<br> to pass them through the parish line.<br> Pass them through?<br> Armed guards are patrolling the road<br> as far up as Riverview.<br> Stopping everybody<br> coming from the city.<br> It's mighty bad in the city,<br> mighty bad.<br> - We're all very fortunate to be up here.<br> - Are any gentlefolk taken down?<br> Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.<br> Ned Warrington's got it.<br> No telling how many others.<br> Where there's sickness<br> they're keeping it a secret.<br> There's talk of shipping<br> those who have it...<br> ...to Lazarette Island<br> where the lepers are.<br> "Lazarette Island<br> where the lepers are"?<br> Like in '30.<br> Why, it ain't civilized to condemn<br> Christian people to Lazarette Island.<br> Well, they won't have a chance at all.<br> No chance at all, Miss Belle.<br> But maybe the rest of us will.<br> Theophilus, we are safe up here?<br> This parish always has been<br> above the fever line.<br> They aim to keep it that way.<br> Excuse me for keeping you all standing.<br> Come on in and freshen up a bit.<br> - Carriage coming!<br> - That must be Pres and Ted now.<br> Carriage coming!<br> - Pres, my dear boy.<br> - Aunt Belle.<br> And Ted.<br> Aunt Belle, everybody,<br> this is Amy, my wife.<br> Pres, your wife?<br> You could have knocked me<br> over with a feather.<br> Hey, Buck, there's your stem-winder.<br> Oh, my dear...<br> Pres' wife would<br> naturally be welcome here...<br> ...but you are for your own sake.<br> - Thank you.<br> Pres' brother has been so gracious<br> in his welcome.<br> I hoped that the others he loves<br> would be the same.<br> Of course we will, my dear.<br> May I present our friends.<br> - May I present General Bogardus?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Mr. Cantrell.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Mr. Allen.<br> - How do you do?<br> My dear, will you come with me?<br> Howdy, ma'am.<br> Mighty nice to have you back<br> with us again, Pres.<br> See that the gentlemen get their juleps.<br> Yes, Miss Belle.<br> - Cato.

Excuse us, please.<br> - You got some mint juleps?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You just follow me now,<br> and I'll show you.<br> It's kind of you to have us. Tell you<br> the truth, I'd have come anyhow.<br> - I hope so.<br> - I've got to go back tomorrow.<br> Back to the city? But, Pres...<br> Things are at sixes and sevens.<br> The fever's left us short-handed.<br> But I want to ask if Amy may stay.<br> I want her out of the city.<br> - But perhaps it isn't convenient.<br> - My dear, Halcyon belongs to its guests.<br> And Pres' wife is, of course,<br> an honored one.<br> Come, my dear.<br> Is this your first visit south?<br> Yes, it's beautiful.<br> Strange and beautiful.<br> - A little frightening.<br> - Frightening?<br> Because of its strangeness<br> and beauty, I suppose.<br> This way, my dear.<br> - You haven't forgotten how.<br> - Me, sir?<br> The head might forget,<br> but the hand remembers.<br> Anyhow, Miss Julie, she's right in<br> behind me all day to fix them...<br> ...just the way you used to like them.<br> Uncle Cato, how is Miss Julie?<br> - Miss Julie? Why, she's just Miss Julie.<br> - Just the same?<br> I reckon princesses, they just naturally<br> grows up to be queens, that's all.<br> Uncle Cato, we've known<br> each other a long time.<br> I'm back now. Home.<br> It's a special occasion.<br> Will you join me in one?<br> Why... Why, Mr. Pres,<br> it ain't hardly proper.<br> But I'll kindly take<br> one out in the pantry...<br> ...and bless you and Miss Julie.<br> Pres.<br> Are you remembering the time<br> you wanted me to wear white?<br> Are you?<br> Well, until now, I never have.<br> Cat got your tongue, Pres?<br> Julie...<br> You said that plain enough.<br> Pres, what fools we were.<br> Julie, you're lovely.<br> Lovelier than ever.<br> Pres, I can't believe it's you here.<br> I dreamed about it so long. A lifetime.<br> No.<br> Longer than that.<br> I put on this white dress for you...<br> ...to help me tell you how humbly<br> I ask you to forgive me.<br> Pres, I'm kneeling to you.<br> Julie, don't.<br> To ask you to forgive me<br> and love me...<br> ...as I love you.<br> - Julie, please.<br> Julie...<br> ...this is Amy, my wife.<br> Your wife?<br> And you're... May I say "Julie"?<br> Pres' wife?<br> - You're funning.<br> - Hardly.<br> Married.<br> My felicitations, Pres.<br> Julie? Julie?<br> Yes, Aunt Belle, in here.<br> I was just congratulating Pres<br> on his marriage.<br> - You from the North, Mrs. Dillard?<br> - New York.<br> She was a Miss Bradford.<br> Isn't that what you told me, my dear?<br> Yes.<br> Bradford.<br> Amy Bradford...<br> ...from New York.<br> I'm very happy to welcome you<br> to Halcyon.<br> Thank you.<br> You have such charming customs here.<br> You may find our customs,<br> as you call them...<br> ...different from those<br> of your country.<br> I did want to meet you.<br> Pres had told me so much about you.<br> Everything, I suppose.<br> Are you very surprised<br> about our getting...?<br> We Louisianans are very impulsive.<br> I wouldn't be surprised<br> at whatever Pres did.<br> - Julie, the others will be coming down.<br> - Oh, yes, Aunt Belle, of course.<br> Would you excuse us a moment?<br> Julie...<br> Julie, child, I'm so sorry.<br> For heaven's sakes,<br> don't be gentle with me now.<br> Do you think I wanna be wept over?<br> I've gotta think, to plan, to fight.<br> - But you can't fight marriage.<br> - Marriage, is it?<br> To that washed-out little Yankee?<br> Pres is mine. He's always been mine.<br> And if I can't have him...<br> - Why, Buck.<br> - Miss Julie.<br> You don't know<br> how glad I am to see you.<br> And I am most pointedly delighted<br> to see you, Miss Julie.<br> Most pointedly delighted.<br> William Lloyd Garrison is a fanatic.<br> Wendell Phillips is another.<br> They've made a mighty<br> touchy situation.<br> But I can't believe<br> the intelligent men up North...<br> ...plot to destroy our sovereign rights.<br> - You sound calm now.<br> You were raring to go when you joined up<br> with Andrew Jackson to fight the British.<br> I was a lot younger then,<br> and a lot foolisher.<br> What Buck's been saying<br> doesn't sound so foolish to me.<br> Most of it makes sense.<br> And I'll take the rest on faith.<br> Why, that's the first time<br> you ever said I talked sense.<br> Well, you don't much.<br> But it's refreshing to see a man<br> who knows his own mind.<br> Don't you think so, Pres?<br> It's hard to know your mind sometimes.<br> If only we could put away<br> this stale old quarrel.<br> Exactly. I always say,<br> "Let sleeping dogs lie."<br> Trouble is, those abolitionists<br> don't act like sleeping dogs.<br> They're scratching their fleas all over.<br> Looks to me like we'll have<br> to hang a few to get us any peace.<br> This William Lloyd Garrison<br> would look elegant that way.<br> I'm afraid your problems wouldn't<br> be solved by hanging Mr. Garrison.<br> Why, there's plenty more.<br> I named Garrison because<br> he's a traitor by his own say-so.<br> And there's such meanness in a traitor.<br> Don't you think so, Pres?<br> Julie spoke to you, Pres.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Oh, just small talk. Don't trouble.<br> I'm sorry. It's... Tonight I'm haunted.<br> - Haunted?<br> - Only by memories, Uncle Cato.<br> It's just coming back here.<br> All my childhood summers.<br> There's so much to remember.<br> Remembering?<br> A forward-looking young banker?<br> Even a banker has memories.<br> Well, he ought to kill them, then,<br> or laugh at them.<br> I interrupted you. You were<br> about to hang somebody for a traitor.<br> Why, for an abolitionist, Miss Julie.<br> I think it was Voltaire who said,<br> "I disagree with everything you say...<br> ...and I will defend to the death<br> your right to say it."<br> Pres, that don't make sense.<br> Maybe Pres got a little beyond us, Buck.<br> We ignorant Southerners simply expect<br> a gentleman to go by his raising.<br> I think we're all agreed on that.<br> Here's how I see it. Cotton is king.<br> Folks are bound to ship cotton<br> down river.<br> So how can New Orleans keep from<br> being the greatest city in America,...<br> ...fever or no fever?<br> I'm afraid there's more than<br> fever the matter.<br> Being up North changed<br> your point of view.<br> I hate to say this, but in a war<br> of commerce, the North must win.<br> That's a curious thing<br> for a Southerner to say.<br> It strikes me that way.<br> But maybe Pres<br> has learned why. Up North.<br> If you must have it, it will be a victory<br> of machines over unskilled slave labor.<br> - Preston!<br> - I don't know that I like that, Dillard.<br> You're not expected to like it.<br> You'll like it a lot less<br> when it happens.<br> And you talk mighty<br> like a black abolitionist.<br> I think you know I'm no abolitionist.<br> I believe the tide has turned against us.<br> But I'll swim against that tide<br> just as far as you will, Cantrell.<br> Sure, we're all of one mind here.<br> We hate an abolitionist<br> as we hate the devil.<br> Naturally, we claim the right<br> to the customs we were born to.<br> Even some of us who question<br> the value of those customs.<br> I like my convictions undiluted,<br> same as I do my bourbon.<br> Frankly, I'm not impressed<br> by Pres' nightmares.<br> I've had dreams myself,<br> but they never come to much.<br> They slip away from you, and you<br> wonder how you could've been so silly.<br> Sure is a fact, Miss Julie.<br> - There was one very curious one I had.<br> - I'd certainly admire to hear it.<br> Oh, heavens, I wouldn't think<br> of boring our guests.<br> Shall we go into<br> the drawing room, ladies?<br> - It wouldn't bore me, Miss Julie.<br> - Perhaps to you later.<br> To you alone.<br> We'll be in the drawing room.<br> You can find us.<br> You can lay 10-1 on me,<br> Miss Julie.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Stephanie,<br> what you giggling about now?<br> Oh, nothing, Mother.<br> - Your health, sir?<br> - Thank you.<br> Mighty good to have you back, Pres.<br> Times are so unsettled<br> we need our good men about us.<br> Looks like it.<br> If the Yankees don't let us be...<br> ...we'll have to teach them manners.<br> I'm afraid facts are against<br> you doing it as easy as that.<br> Your facts are to scare women<br> and sell Northern bonds.<br> - Cantrell.<br> - I don't like to hear that.<br> One fact you can't deny: That we're<br> the guests of a charming hostess.<br> Sorry, general.<br> Most likely I misunderstood you, sir.<br> I don't think you misunderstood, sir.<br> I expressed an opinion.<br> There was nothing personal about it.<br> Take it as you like.<br> Why, if it wasn't personal,<br> I'm satisfied.<br> Just understand, Cantrell...<br> ...the question of being satisfied about<br> my opinions is of no importance to me.<br> Gentlemen. Gentlemen.<br> Don't look like we're in the mood<br> for political discussion.<br> - Come. Shall we go in to the ladies?<br> - I'm with you there, general.<br> Shucks, Buck, we're all friends here.<br> Old friends.<br> Naturally, we are. Come along.<br> Buck seems dead set<br> to pick a quarrel with you.<br> That's nothing new for Buck.<br> And Julie, she's set herself up<br> to fascinate Buck...<br> ...like a Gallatin Street girl.<br> Great ladies and Gallatin Street girls,<br> my dear brother, have a lot in common.<br> Look here, has Julie been...?<br> The less you crack your teeth,<br> the longer you'll have them, youngster.<br> Ted, Pres, Julie wants you both<br> right away.<br> - Miss Massie is gonna play for us.<br> - Thanks, Stephanie.<br> - Coming, Pres?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Uncle Cato.<br> - Yes, sir, Mr. Pres?<br> How's Miss Julie been?<br> Has she seen lots of people? I mean...<br> No, sir, she ain't.<br> She ain't seen nobody much.<br> Just stay in the house<br> or ride the horse.<br> Mr. Pres, your lady take tea<br> or coffee in the morning?<br> I hear folks<br> eats mighty curious up North.<br> Coffee.<br> Uncle Cato, has Mr. Cantrell<br> been up here? I mean, before today?<br> No, sir, he ain't. No company at all.<br> - Thanks, Uncle Cato.<br> - Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.<br> Pres, why did you do it?<br> Why, Pres?<br> Because I love her.<br> - But you had my love.<br> - And lost it.<br> Wasn't that memory more real<br> than anything she had to give to you?<br> Oh, don't be cross with me, Pres.<br> Just tell me.<br> - You must.<br> - Please don't, Julie.<br> Shall I cry for you?<br> Nobody ever made me cry but you...<br> ...and that was only twice.<br> - Do you remember?<br> - Yes.<br> How much do you remember?<br> Everything you ever said or did.<br> But that's passed now, Julie.<br> Done, finished.<br> I ought to have come to you.<br> I wanted to so terribly.<br> It was because I wanted to so much<br> that I couldn't.<br> You do understand that,<br> don't you, Pres?<br> I didn't understand.<br> I just knew what you did.<br> But you had to come home,<br> didn't you?<br> You had to come back to the country<br> and the things you know...<br> ...because you belong here.<br> Nothing can change that.<br> Pres, listen.<br> Can you hear them?<br> The night noises?<br> The mockingbird in the magnolia?<br> See the moss hanging<br> from the moonlight?<br> You can fairly taste<br> the night, can't you?<br> You're part of it, Pres.<br> And it's part of you...<br> ...like I am.<br> You can't get away from us, Pres.<br> We're both in your blood.<br> This is the country you were born to,<br> the country you know and trust.<br> Your country, Pres.<br> Amy wouldn't understand.<br> - She'd think there'd be snakes.<br> - Julie, please.<br> Oh, it isn't tame<br> and easy like the North.<br> It's quick and dangerous,<br> but you trust it.<br> Remember how the fever mist<br> smells in the bottoms, rank and rotten?<br> But you trust that too<br> because it's part of you...<br> ...just as I'm part of you,<br> and we'll never let you go.<br> Pres, you're afraid.<br> Miss Julie, I thought we'd lost you.<br> That's a right nice little Yankee.<br> Pretty as a red wagon.<br> But trying to talk to her...<br> - That must've been something.<br> - I tried her on horses.<br> She told me about a policeman's horse<br> she'd feed sugar to back North.<br> I tried her on hound dogs. She thinks<br> a Walker Hound is one that walks.<br> My zing, don't they educate women<br> up North? She's just plain ignorant.<br> Northern girls are just<br> educated differently.<br> - She probably knows calculus.<br> - Sure, Miss Julie.<br> Any flower wench knows calculus.<br> By Calculation, out of Siderial Maid.<br> Won the Ranger Stakes in '47.<br> What's the matter?<br> Do you ache anywhere?<br> - Oh, it's nothing.<br> - It is.<br> Look here, Miss Julie, you were out here<br> a mighty long time with Pres Dillard.<br> Oh, please, Buck.<br> Pres had just been<br> punishing the brandy and...<br> My back teeth.<br> Did he lose his capacity to drink<br> like a gentleman in the North?<br> What does he think a lady's house is?<br> A riverboat bar? What did he do?<br> Buck, I wouldn't have some silly thing<br> I said be the cause of anything.<br> Miss Julie, you won't be<br> the cause of anything.<br> Depend on me.<br> Thank you, Buck.<br> Oh, that's the cannon<br> from New Orleans.<br> - You can hear it when the wind's right.<br> - There it goes again.<br> - Wind has shifted to the south.<br> - I can't bear loud and sudden noises.<br> Even firecrackers give me palpitations.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's the fever cannon down in the city.<br> - Fever cannon?<br> - Yes.<br> At night they set tar barrels<br> blazing on every corner.<br> And the Washington artillery<br> fire a cannon to fight the plague.<br> What good does that do?<br> Everybody knows it starts<br> air currents to carry the fever away.<br> They might better drain the swamps<br> and clean up the city.<br> - Is that what they do in Yankee land?<br> - They do.<br> And other customs up North<br> that will bear copying.<br> Eating horse-feed beans, maybe?<br> Everyone to his own taste.<br> I'll have to remind you, sir,...<br> ...that my wife is a<br> Northerner and a stranger here.<br> - You talk like you're the same.<br> - See here, Buck!<br> I'm sorry, but this subject<br> is an unwelcome one.<br> Excuse me, but as mistress of the house,<br> you'll agree with me, I'm sure.<br> Why, Aunt Belle, I wouldn't think<br> of forbidding any subject to my guests.<br> Mr. Pres, sir? Here come<br> a white gentleman looking for you.<br> - Hello, Jenkins. What is it?<br> - Dr. Livingstone sent me.<br> Mr. La Cour's down bad with the fever.<br> Doctor says you better come right down.<br> Of course. Send a boy for my carriage.<br> You told him he could go visiting<br> with his folks down the Riverview.<br> - Well, Bat will drive you.<br> - Yes, hurry up.<br> Sir, Mr. La Cour is bad.<br> He wants to talk<br> some bank business to you before...<br> Well, before it gets too late.<br> - Was I you, I'd ride. Be quicker.<br> - All right.<br> You'll stop at Halcyon tonight, Jenkins.<br> Make the journey back at your pleasure.<br> Gracious of you, Mistress Massie,<br> but I must return at once.<br> Then you'll need a fresh mount.<br> There's Bayou Belle and Donna Cona<br> in the stables.<br> Bat will go with you<br> to bring the horses back.<br> - Go along and saddle them.<br> - Yes.<br> Thank you, Aunt Belle.<br> - I ought to go with you.<br> - No, won't take long.<br> You come down in the carriage.<br> - Ted, get me a coat.<br> - Right away.<br> I'm gonna put on some boots.<br> You take care of her.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Would you care to freshen up,<br> Mr. Jenkins?<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> - Would you mind?<br> Gladly.<br> Why, Erroneous.<br> What are you two doing here?<br> Zette done say for us<br> to make inquirements...<br> ...when we all is to sing<br> with you and Master Pres.<br> Just another old custom, Mrs. Dillard.<br> Tell Zette they can come up any time.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - What time, Miss Julie?<br> Ain't you hear?<br> She done say, "Any time."<br> - That don't mean nothing.<br> - It sure do.<br> Of course it does, Errata.<br> Just you tell her.<br> - Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.<br> - It do.<br> It don't.<br> Hope you'll all forgive me.<br> Goodbye, Mrs. Kendrick. Goodbye.<br> We understand perfectly, Pres.<br> - Now, darling, don't fret about me.<br> - I'll try not to.<br> - You'll look after Amy, won't you, Ted?<br> - You needn't have asked.<br> - Goodbye. Goodbye, everybody.<br> - Goodbye, Preston.<br> - Goodbye, Pres.<br> - Goodbye, Julie.<br> - I do hope everything will be all right.<br> - It always is.<br> Of course, it's a pity Pres<br> had to leave now.<br> But I suppose his bank comes first.<br> You don't find that admirable?<br> Oh, admirable, I suppose.<br> It just seems to me<br> there are other things more interesting.<br> I imagine Buck finds it so.<br> Why, I never go into<br> a bank if I can help it.<br> Seems like they're studying how<br> to get something away from somebody.<br> I wouldn't say that, Buck.<br> What Mr. Cantrell means<br> is that most folks down here...<br> ...prefer other pursuits, like planting.<br> You needn't apologize for Mr. Cantrell.<br> I'm sure he's capable of defending<br> his own insinuations.<br> Why, Mistress Dillard, ma'am,<br> I surely didn't mean to offend.<br> Of course, Amy.<br> Buck didn't realize what he was saying.<br> He doesn't even realize<br> how Julie's using him.<br> - Ted.<br> - How you mean that, son?<br> I don't get the sense of it,<br> but it don't sound polite.<br> You know what I mean.<br> Julie's been egging you on,<br> first against Pres and now his wife.<br> - Ted, be quiet!<br> - I meant what I said.<br> Let's figure I didn't hear, then.<br> And I'd keep Miss Julie's name<br> out of your conversation.<br> You're fool enough to defend<br> what you don't even understand?<br> Buck, don't you pay<br> any attention to him.<br> I don't see anybody<br> that needs any defense.<br> If I did, I'd make out<br> to defend them, yes.<br> - Let's put it this way, Mr. Cantrell.<br> - Now, Ted.<br> All evening long, I thought you coarse<br> and loud and not a gentleman.<br> That's better. No need for that.<br> Very well, Mr. Dillard, sir.<br> I'd be glad of your kindness, Dick.<br> Happy to do you the honor.<br> You young jackass.<br> - Buck, you surely don't mean to...<br> - Miss Belle, don't mean nothing at all.<br> Just talking.<br> What does he mean to do, Aunt Belle?<br> Buck.<br> - Of course you're joking?<br> - Joking, ma'am?<br> Buck, I forbid you.<br> As a guest in my house.<br> Forbid me what, ma'am?<br> - To do what you're planning.<br> - I don't know what you mean, Miss Julie.<br> Oh, stop play-acting.<br> Your stupid code. It's for fools.<br> You, too, beginning to think<br> our customs are old-fashioned?<br> Oh, Buck, I beg you.<br> This mustn't happen.<br> I don't understand.<br> I guess there's a lot<br> I don't understand.<br> Naturally, you'll apologize to Buck.<br> General Bogardus,<br> may I put myself in your hands?<br> You'll be good enough<br> to make the arrangements.<br> Ted, listen to me.<br> You can't do this. You must've...<br> Uncle Thee, you won't let this go<br> any further, will you?<br> Mighty little I can do about it now.<br> - Naturally, I'll do everything I can.<br> - Whatever it is, you must do it.<br> Isn't this what you wanted, Julie?<br> Or did your plans go astray?<br> We women can start the men quarreling<br> often enough.<br> We can't ever stop them.<br> Come on.<br> "Let's Raise a Ruckus Tonight."<br> - Julie.<br> - Come on, sing, Aunt Belle.<br> Have the little Yankee join in.<br> We have such charming customs<br> down here.<br> That's why I wore<br> my white dress tonight.<br> I'm being baptized.<br> You'd no business to take him up, a<br> youngster that's never been out before.<br> Why, if he's gonna talk man-size,<br> he's gotta act man-size.<br> - But, Buck...<br> - Why, Dick, he's lucky.<br> All I aim to do is clip a wing.<br> Fix him so he won't fly too high.<br> Mighty nervous feeling<br> the first time you face shot.<br> Wish I could tell him,<br> but that would be highly irregular.<br> Anyhow, it might hurt his feelings.<br> Don't be a fool, Ted. Buck has offered<br> twice to accept an apology.<br> He doesn't want to fight you.<br> You realize what you're up against?<br> I've had the benefit of Buck Cantrell's<br> skill and experience.<br> I'll make the best use of it I can.<br> Gentlemen, take your places.<br> Remember, gentlemen,<br> you turn and fire at the count of 10.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Places.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - At your service, sir.<br> Ready, sir.<br> Gentlemen. One, two, three, four...<br> ...five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.<br> Are you savages, you Southerners?<br> I'll fix him so he don't garter<br> around me no more.<br> Good morning.<br> What brought you all out so early?<br> It's a grand morning,<br> I couldn't resist it.<br> Where are the gentlemen?<br> - You know very well where they are.<br> - Oh, yes, at a meeting.<br> A silly custom, but a part of what<br> we Southerners call our chivalry.<br> You know, sometimes I envy them.<br> To face the one you hate,...<br> ...to kill or be killed,<br> to settle something.<br> We can't do that. We're women.<br> Oh, Zette, aren't they beautiful?<br> Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.<br> Right nice and pretty.<br> Right nice and pretty.<br> Pretty enough for Ted's grave.<br> Ted.<br> Buck's dead.<br> I never saw a man die before.<br> He knew what you had done.<br> Before he died, he told me so.<br> - Miss Amy, we're leaving, get ready.<br> - Thank you, general.<br> Miss Molly, you'll ride back with us.<br> Dick will follow.<br> I quite understand, Uncle Thee.<br> My respects, ma'am.<br> I'll arrange to turn my guardianship<br> over to the bank.<br> - Julie, I...<br> - Stephanie.<br> All right, Zette.<br> Well, say it.<br> What are you thinking?<br> I'm thinking of a woman<br> called Jezebel...<br> ...who did evil in the sight of God.<br> He's to bury.<br> - More killing.<br> - Sorry, gentlemen, a case of "had to."<br> - A fugitive?<br> - No.<br> Just a poor fool who was crazy enough<br> to think he could run the fever line.<br> - Has it spread this far?<br> - Sure.<br> Spreading like wildfire<br> all along the river, yellow jack is.<br> We got orders to shoot whoever tries<br> to pass the parish boundaries...<br> ...coming or going.<br> You mean no one can get<br> downriver to New Orleans?<br> That's the law, gentlemen.<br> Mind if we leave the body here<br> till we can get a wagon?<br> I'm sorry, ladies.<br> You heard what the sheriff said.<br> Uncle Cato,<br> bring the baggage back in.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> my home is yours, as always.<br> That's today's crop for Lazarette Island.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Good evening, doctor.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Bourbon.<br> - Certainly, doctor.<br> Make mine double.<br> Well, they might as well now.<br> Good a time as any.<br> Ain't that kind of unusual for you,<br> son?<br> Are you telling me what I can drink?<br> Why, Pres...<br> Lord.<br> Dr. Livingstone,<br> I don't know why I said that.<br> - Don't you feel right, son?<br> - Kind of edgy, maybe.<br> It's been a tough day.<br> I caught chill walking up.<br> Chill? You better be easing down.<br> With La Cour gone, we want you<br> to clear up that mess in the bank.<br> It couldn't be.<br> I saw him myself day before yesterday.<br> Well, I saw him an hour ago.<br> You think I don't know<br> a dead man when I see one...<br> ...and him laying in his coffin?<br> - His folks brought the body down.<br> - What happened now?<br> Huger here claims<br> Buck Cantrell is dead.<br> - What? Buck, dead?<br> - Fever?<br> Sure, Huger, you're crazy.<br> I'll give 20-1<br> Buck Cantrell is to bury.<br> I'll give 10-to-1<br> Ted Dillard shot him in a duel.<br> Ten-to-one?<br> Ted Dillard follows him<br> around like a hound dog.<br> Ted Dillard? And Buck? The best<br> pistol shot in Louisiana?<br> Come on.<br> - Twenty-to-one. Any takers?<br> - Yes.<br> I believe I heard you make<br> a private matter...<br> ...that concerns my family<br> the subject of a bet.<br> - Why, Dillard. I'm mighty sorry.<br> - It's not a thing to bet on.<br> No, I reckon you're right.<br> Only there's been so many<br> dead folks lately, that...<br> - Dillard.<br> - Why?<br> - Yellow jack!<br> - We must get out of here!<br> - Yellow jack!<br> - Yellow jack!<br> Get out of here!<br> One of you lend a hand here.<br> Ain't the one of you got enough whiskey<br> in him to give you a little courage?<br> You're gonna let him lie here,<br> you drunken blackguards?<br> If one of you don't help me, everyone<br> of you whose face I remember...<br> ...I'll call out, if you live through<br> this epidemic, to be challenged.<br> You, Laurette.<br> Taylor, Van Noy, come on! Come on!<br> - Some rice, Dick?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - More gumbo, Uncle Thee?<br> - Thank you.<br> Serve the wine, Uncle Cato.<br> Miss Julie, please, ma'am.<br> Bat, he just come.<br> Say Dr. Livingstone sent him back.<br> Mr. Pres, he got the fever bad.<br> - The fever?<br> - Pres? It can't be.<br> Yes, ma'am. He take him to your house<br> because hotel folks won't take him in.<br> He say y'all get there quick, before<br> they hustle him off to that leper place.<br> Leper place? What does he mean?<br> Lazarette Island,<br> where they ship the fever victims.<br> - Get our carriage.<br> - But, Ted, you can't get through.<br> Cato, have a couple of horses saddled.<br> Ted, come with me. You all stay here.<br> Miss Amy, I'll get a pass<br> from the governor, short of killing.<br> You and Miss Amy be dressed and ready.<br> We'll be back as soon as we can.<br> - Bat?<br> - Yes, Miss Julie.<br> Go on and eat. Go on.<br> How come they let you through<br> the fever line? Sit down and eat.<br> They never. I just<br> kind of oozed through.<br> How?<br> Well, when the white gentlemen<br> stop me...<br> ...I leave the horse and go walking<br> across the back of the parish...<br> ...because I'm bound<br> to get back to Halcyon.<br> I just kind of squinched<br> through the cane by the bayou.<br> - You swam the bayou?<br> - No, ma'am, Miss Julie.<br> I scared of them gators.<br> I just kind of found me<br> a double-end boat.<br> It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.<br> I fixing to take it back.<br> You are. You're going back right now.<br> And I'm going with you.<br> Get me a cloak.<br> I'll meet you at the smokehouse.<br> - Miss Julie...<br> - Go on. Hurry!<br> Miss Julie, ma'am!<br> It's too risky<br> for a white lady, Miss Julie.<br> I kind of mix in with the night.<br> But them sheriff folks ain't fooling.<br> They're shooting first<br> and asking after.<br> Bat, we're going!<br> But, Miss Julie...<br> Get me a coat.<br> All right, I'm coming.

His place is here.<br> Miss Julie!<br> I don't think<br> you ought to go up there.<br> Yes... Blood... Blood...<br> That's what is...<br> You oughtn't<br> to be in here, Miss Julie.<br> Yellow jack's mighty catching.<br> Pres.<br> It's my head.<br> Just keep on applying<br> the cold compresses.<br> That's all we can do.<br> - Get some ice.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Be quick.<br> It's a part of a...<br> Remember...

I will.<br> Whatever you might do,<br> I can do more...<br> ...because I know how to fight<br> better than you.<br> Amy, if you knew<br> the horror of that place.<br> It isn't a hospital.<br> It's a desolate island haunted by death.<br> They'll put Pres in an open shed<br> with a hundred others.<br> You must be there with him day and<br> night, watching every breath he draws.<br> You must bathe him, keep him clean...<br> ...give him drugs,<br> fight for his food and water.<br> You must keep the living from him,<br> and the dead.<br> Be there by him,<br> with your body between him and death.<br> Amy, I...<br> Where is he?<br> Upstairs. End of the hall.<br> - I'm not afraid.<br> - No, you're not afraid.<br> You're the bravest woman I ever saw.<br> I even believe<br> you have the courage to save him...<br> ...by giving me the right<br> to go in your place.<br> You're not afraid to die.<br> I boldly ask a greater sacrifice<br> in Pres' name, his life.<br> And for yourself?<br> I'm asking for the chance to prove I<br> can be brave and strong and unselfish.<br> Help me, Amy.<br> Help me make myself clean again,<br> as you are clean.<br> Let me prove myself worthy<br> of the love I bear him.<br> Julie, tell me, something<br> that only you can tell me...<br> ...does Pres still love you?<br> He himself might not know,<br> but you would.<br> - Amy, you must let me go with him.<br> - Tell me.<br> What does it matter who he loves?<br> It's his life that matters.<br> Tell me.<br> We both know.<br> Pres loves his wife.<br> Who else would he love?<br> Not me, surely.<br> I've done too much against him.<br> You see, I never knew<br> how to be gentle and brave as you are.<br> Had there been any love<br> in his heart for me...<br> ...I'd have taken him from you.<br> I tried and failed...<br> ...because he loves only you.<br> I'm grateful to you for telling me,<br> but I had to know.<br> Amy.<br> God protect you and Pres.<br>
