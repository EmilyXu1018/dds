                        JOAN OF ARC<br> And so by disposition<br> of the divine mercy,<br> it was done most opportunely,<br> that Joan, child of god,<br> daughter of France,<br> today be placed among the<br> number of the saints.<br> Saint Joan of Arc whose<br> history is recorded here,<br> lived only 19<br> years on this earth.<br> She was born in 1412<br> in a village of Domremy,<br> on the marche of Lorraine.<br> At the time when France,<br> losing the hundred years war,<br> was overrun by her enemies, her<br> cities ruined, her farms stripped bare,<br> her people hopeless.<br> But the enemies of France did<br> not reckon on the girl Joan<br> praying in the little<br> ruined church of her village.<br> As she knelt there, the voices of the<br> saint spoke to her again and again,<br> urging her to become a soldier,<br> to lead the armies of France<br> to victory.<br> But how?<br> How can I?<br> Save France? How can I?<br> Lead the Dauphin<br> to his coronation?<br> I'm only a poor girl of the farms.<br> I've never seen a king or an army.<br> How?<br> I'm not fitted to speak to<br> great people or among them.<br> All this time I have... I have<br> tried to make a beginning<br> but I can find no ways<br> so nothing is done.<br> I know that everyday<br> now we lose France.<br> But I still don't how to go<br> about what is asked of me.<br> So I do nothing.<br> Forgive me, forgive me.<br> I am helpless and anguish.<br> Will a voice come and<br> say that I am forgiven.<br> I've tried with all<br> my soul, I've tried.<br> Then I must go<br> and do what I can<br> without knowing how.<br> Uncle Durand!<br> Uncle Durand!<br> Uncle Durand!<br> Jeannette, did I forget<br> something? -No, only uncle Durand<br> I must go to Vaucouleurs,<br> take me with you.<br> To Vacouleurs? -Yes.<br> Your father said nothing about this to<br> me. Your mother said nothing about it.<br> No.<br> Well this is very<br> strange, Jeannette.<br> You want to buy<br> something in the city?<br> I have to speak to Sir<br> Robert de Baudricourt.<br> What about? Why would you<br> speak to the King's captain?<br> I can't tell you Uncle<br> Durand. -Then I can't take you.<br> I shall walk then.<br> Even if I wear my legs<br> to the knees, I must go.<br> It maybe that I do<br> wrong... but come.<br> Next. -Gerard<br> Morseau, Sir Robert.<br> Morseau, you are late for the taxes.<br> -Uh they burn my house, Sir Robert.<br> Stole my grain. -Give<br> him till next harvest.<br> Durand Laxart,<br> Taxes in your village is not<br> due yet. -I know, Sir Robert.<br> This is uh... this<br> is my niece. -Hm.<br> She is the daughter of Jacques<br> D'Arcde of Domrmy. -Yes, yes.<br> She wish to speak with you.<br> I... I... -Yes, yes, go<br> on, go speak up. Tell me.<br> I... I bring you a<br> message Sir Robert.<br> You must send me to the<br> Dauphin. My lord commands it.<br> Your lord? I am your lord!<br> My Lord is the King of Heaven.<br> -Hm, that's a point. That's a point.<br> But I am to lead<br> the Dauphin's armies.<br> To lead his armies? When<br> did the Dauphin have an army?<br> And women don't lead<br> armies girl, they follow!<br> And if you want to become them,<br> the camp follower can be arranged.<br> But I'm to save<br> France. -To save France?<br> Go home girl and<br> don't be an idiot!<br> If it would have<br> been possible to save<br> France, it would have<br> been done long ago.<br> But you must send me to the<br> Dauphin, I must save France!<br> I am sorry, Sir Robert. I didn't<br> know what she is going to say.<br> I'll take her home.<br> What a fool you<br> made out of me, if<br> I've known what you<br> are going to say...<br> I didn't want to<br> bring this on you<br> uncle Durand, but<br> there was no other way.<br> And I had to speak to him. -You had<br> to? Your father will never forgive me.<br> Never in the world!<br> -Hush, hush cousin.<br> Make way!<br> Attention! Make way!<br> Jeannette! No,<br> Jeannette, come back!<br> Sir Robert has<br> spoken! -Sir Robert!<br> Sir Robert, you must send me<br> out to take part in the war!<br> Orleans is in great danger, and<br> even today a battle is raging.<br> What? Orleans is 200 leagues from here,<br> nobody knows what's going on there.<br> Sir Robert!<br> Sir Robert!<br> Jeannette!<br> That's a very strange<br> thing you said girl.<br> Yes, they are strange.<br> I'm sent here to speak<br> to Sir Robert, but you<br> saw that he cares neither<br> for me nor for my words.<br> Nevertheless before the middle of<br> Lent I must be with the Dauphin.<br> Believe me I rather go home<br> and spin with my mother.<br> For this is not my proper place. But<br> there is not one person in the world,<br> not among Kings, or<br> nobles, or princes<br> who can bring help<br> to the France we love.<br> Not once save this<br> maid you see before you.<br> It's not because of<br> anything in me, but<br> because the King of<br> heaven wishes it so.<br> Have you heard of a prophecy?<br> There is a prophecy that a maid<br> from Lorraine will save France.<br> Have you heard it? -No, I<br> know nothing of a prophecy.<br> Why are you here again?<br> You know Sir Robert won't see you. Go<br> home girl and don't come back tomorrow.<br> That's she, coming now.<br> Forgive me, but are you the maid?<br> -I'm Joan, daughter of Jacques D'Arc.<br> We heard about you in<br> Lille, we wanted to see you.<br> And to tell you that we believe<br> in you, we prayed for you.<br> We held a mass for<br> you last Sunday.<br> Thank you.<br> I know that your<br> prayers will help.<br> The gates were locked<br> in my face again.<br> Mother.<br> I came to take you<br> home, Jeannette.<br> You must come home, Jeannette.<br> A dark dream has<br> crept over you for a<br> little while, but its<br> done no harm, and soon<br> it will be gone<br> and when it's gone<br> no one will think of it.<br> But come home.<br> I never wanted to<br> hurt you, mother<br> For I love you more than<br> anyone else in the world.<br> But if I had a 100<br> fathers and a 100 mothers,<br> I could not go back.<br> I must go forward now.<br> Then tell me where, Jeannette?<br> Toward what would you go?<br> Where's the<br> girl? -Sir Robert.<br> That's the one.<br> Exactly 2 weeks ago you came<br> to see me and spoke of a battle.<br> Today a courier<br> came with messages.<br> There was indeed a<br> great battle on that day.<br> And a heavy defeat<br> for the Dauphin.<br> How did you learnt this?<br> Have you studied witchcraft?<br> Oh surely you know I have not.<br> -That is just what we do not know.<br> Father Fournier,<br> put her to question.<br> If you are a thing of evil and<br> sent from Satan, depart from us.<br> If you are good and<br> from god, come near<br> I ask your blessing, father.<br> And I ask of whatever<br> is evil fly far from you<br> Whatever is good remain to help<br> our cause in the course of France.<br> She is no socerer, Sir Robert.<br> Whatever you have heard or<br> see, whether prophecy or not,<br> the devil has no part in it.<br> Thank you, father.<br> You still wish to go to the Dauphin.<br> -My Lord has commanded me to go.<br> These 2 gentlemen wish me to<br> send you forth on this wild<br> mission of yours, they are<br> willing to ride with you as escort.<br> To me it seems like<br> a fool's attempt,<br> but they believe you<br> may help our country.<br> Now if there is a chance of that, I<br> don't want to put anything in the way.<br> Then it shall all come true.<br> Goodbye, my child.<br> Ever since I heard you speak,<br> I've got a kind of dream.<br> But I never yet seen it<br> clearly where I must go,<br> or what I must<br> do with my life.<br> But suddenly, when I heard your<br> voice, it seem to me that I knew.<br> I come to be your follower.<br> Thank you. You are the first.<br> And I'm quite willing to be<br> the second. When do we set out?<br> Today rather than tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow rather than the day after.<br> Joan, have you ridden before?<br> By the time we reach<br> Chinon I should ride well.<br> Take care that you<br> ride only by night,<br> the news of your coming<br> will run ahead like<br> fire and the enemy will<br> want to watch for you.<br> I fear them not.<br> A mother bears children<br> and gives them to<br> the world and she thinks<br> she knows them well.<br> But she doesn't<br> know them at all.<br> And now you must<br> go. Guard her well.<br> With many leagues to ride<br> and icy rivers to cross.<br> Go to the shrine of redeemer,<br> mother, and pray for us.<br> Goodbye! -God be with you!<br> Godspeed, Joan, come<br> back soon! -Goodbye, Joan!<br> God help you<br> Joan. -Thank you!<br> Go then maid of Lorraine,<br> I expect but little of you,<br> but go... and come what may.<br> Farewell, Joan!<br> Goodbye! -Farewell, Joan!<br> Well, tell us who you are!<br> Travelers, my friend,<br> just travelers.<br> And who may you be? -I'm the<br> head constable of Clairevaux.<br> We're honest men.<br> You may be, but I<br> must look at you.<br> Are you a lad?<br> Let me tell you why we meet you<br> here. -Well, tell us and let us go on.<br> There is a party of Burgundy<br> soldiers in our town.<br> They say that they're here to lay<br> hands on the maid from Lorraine,<br> the one that is coming<br> to help the Dauphin.<br> If one of you<br> should be that maid,<br> Then go round our village.<br> -Thank you, constable.<br> This does not concern us.<br> My wife send two<br> loaves of bread.<br> That was the best we<br> could do. -Thank you again.<br> I would like to if<br> you would permit me to<br> lay them in the hands<br> of the lad myself.<br> If it should be that you're<br> the maid from Lorraine,<br> I don't say that you<br> are, but if it should be,<br> I have a message for you<br> from the people of Clairevaux.<br> It's this:<br> "God go with you."<br> "God go with you and save<br> France and save us too."<br> Now we can go to our<br> homes, neighbours,<br> we've seen her and we've<br> given her the warning.<br> Those are the<br> towers of Chinon.<br> Oh we've come through safely.<br> We're here.<br> Did you bring the<br> gold Tremouille? -Gold?<br> Gold? No, I did not.<br> You should bow when you<br> come into the presence, Duke.<br> Your attitude is... slovenly.<br> You owe me money. -Money?<br> I have definite information that<br> you plan to abandon your kingdom.<br> You're leaving us.<br> You're deserting us.<br> If I lent you 3,000 crowns,<br> you dissapear to the North or the<br> South and I can whistle for my money.<br> Not only this loan in question but<br> the enormous sums you already owe me.<br> Then lend me a thousand.<br> It's safer, I can't<br> go very far on that.<br> I'll need your signature.<br> I refuse to sign<br> until I have the money.<br> I'll need your<br> signature first.<br> Lacky, a quill for my Lord. -You<br> robber! You thief! You brigand!<br> Gentlemen, not<br> before the court.<br> Before he lends me<br> money he demands my<br> signature at the<br> bottom of a blank page,<br> and I know why.<br> Everytime I borrow from<br> him he uses my signature<br> to sell some of my<br> territory to Burgundy<br> to raise the<br> money he lends me.<br> A prophet has<br> come from Lorraine.<br> Promising to save France<br> and crown our Dauphin.<br> The game is we put the Count<br> of Clermont on the throne,<br> he will pretend that he<br> is the illustrious Charles.<br> When the evening is over, I shall<br> be Dauphin by popular demand, huh?<br> Fortunately, that<br> is not enough.<br> Now, sit on the<br> throne. -Please,<br> a little obeisance,<br> my good people.<br> That's better.<br> Now, let her enter.<br> Let her enter, I say.<br> Ah... there are three of you.<br> And which may I ask is<br> the maid of Lorraine?<br> I am the maid from Lorraine. -Who<br> are these other maidens with you?<br> This is Jean de Metz and Bertrand<br> de Poulengy came with me to guard me.<br> A family of three?<br> Sir if you mean anything against<br> the maid or doubt our respect for her<br> I advice to watch<br> what you say.<br> My apologies.<br> I'd rather nobody knelt to me.<br> Then nobody will. I assure you, it's<br> not a position one chooses for comfort.<br> But come, here's<br> our great Dauphin.<br> Well, here I sit waiting for the crown<br> you promised me, maid of Lorraine.<br> See that I am crowned.<br> See that I am crowned at once.<br> Here,<br> your Dauphin offers<br> you his hand, maiden.<br> My gentle Dauphin<br> it is you I seek.<br> I've come a long way to find you<br> and no other can take your place.<br> God has spoken to me<br> thru his messengers.<br> And it is his will that I come to aid<br> you and that you'll be King of France.<br> How did you know me?<br> I can tell you that<br> when we are alone.<br> What is your opinion? -This girl is<br> dangerous, there must be a third party.<br> I could swear she was sent by your<br> enemies. -My Dauphin, I say to you<br> from this hour the<br> war will change.<br> And your life will change.<br> But the truth is, Joan,<br> I'm not the sort of person<br> God would be very likely<br> to be interested in.<br> Truely, I'm not.<br> Though I'm no worse than the<br> others here probably but...<br> God bothers very little with<br> any of us if you should ask me.<br> Now, I've been honest with<br> you. Be honest with me.<br> What is it you want? Money?<br> Lands?<br> Presents?<br> I'm a poor man in<br> spite of being...<br> It is not true that God<br> takes no interest in you.<br> You say that to hide yourself from me<br> as you just now hid among the women.<br> But God will find you<br> out. And make you King.<br> This is an honest voice.<br> Listen to her, Charles.<br> I think you've<br> come just in time.<br> For a moment... I thought<br> you were the Dauphin.<br> I'm his cousin,<br> the Duke of Ronson.<br> I'm glad you're<br> here, good Duke.<br> The more we gather of<br> the royal blood of France,<br> the stronger is our cause.<br> -Don't trust her my Lord.<br> I'm trying not to trust her.<br> But everytime I<br> looked into her eyes,<br> I believe what she says is true.<br> -More reason to distrust her.<br> Gentle Dauphin,<br> if I tell you things so secret that<br> they are known to you and God alone,<br> will you believe<br> that I am sent by him?<br> Come with me, Joan.<br> Nicholas, unhinge from<br> the plow! Bring your horse!<br> Come and join the maid's army!<br> Maid? She has no army!<br> Then she will soon have<br> one! -Come along, Nicholas!<br> Come along! -Join us!<br> Men come flocking<br> by the thousands.<br> The maid's name is magic.<br> My people believe in<br> that. -Nobody holds back?<br> Why? Why? Why?<br> The army gathered.<br> Men are coming<br> from everywhere.<br> Gold and jewels are dug from the<br> ground and poured into the treasury.<br> Grain and cattle we couldn't<br> buy are sent as gifts.<br> You ordered us to raise<br> the army, we've done it.<br> But you still haven't<br> given us the word to march.<br> But I couldn't very well<br> before the girl had been<br> examined by the archbishop<br> and the officers of the church.<br> But the examination<br> has finished.<br> questioned her over<br> They sent to Domremy<br> and Vaoucouieurs<br> for all the available<br> evidence of allure.<br> The church finds Joan untouched,<br> religious and pure at heart,<br> and says so formally. -Yes.<br> Although we find nothing<br> except good in her,<br> still we are not certain if it's<br> wise to send her into battle.<br> At present you are at least alive,<br> Dauphin, but if you throw yourself<br> into this war you may lose not<br> only your kingdom, but your life.<br> I'm not going to lead the<br> army. She's going to lead it.<br> A green country girl<br> leading an army of France?<br> You will be the laughing<br> stock of Christiandom.<br> I've been there for a long<br> time. Thanks to you... and you.<br> For years you've<br> tried to convince me<br> that I'm a pretender<br> to my father's throne.<br> A scoundrel, an imbecile. At times<br> I've been inclined to believe you.<br> But then she came...<br> and sort me out.<br> What did she tell<br> you in the chapel?<br> I can't tell you that.<br> And I won't.<br> You'll tell us. You've never<br> kept a secret in your life.<br> I shall keep this one.<br> The truth is I don't yet<br> know what I want to do.<br> It's my own head, mind you.<br> My own head and my crown.<br> I don't know whether<br> I want to risk them.<br> But how long are we to wait?<br> Are we never to relieve Orleans.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> The longer you wait<br> the wiser, your Majesty.<br> I'm not sure of that either.<br> Your majesty, l... -My<br> Dauphin, forgive my bad manners.<br> For days I've tried to see you but the<br> guard said no, you were in council...<br> My dear Joan, that cloak<br> becomes you, you look radiant!<br> I thank you for it, my Dauphin,<br> all preparations are made.<br> Let us have action. Men of<br> action and not men of words!<br> Send me to Orleans, the sign<br> you asked for will be given.<br> Now is the time. -There<br> is always time, Joan.<br> No, there is not<br> always time, my Dauphin.<br> Use me well, for I've told you I<br> shall last a year but a little longer.<br> Come ride with us to Orleans.<br> If you wish me to say yes, you must<br> not ask for unreasonable things.<br> You must not ask<br> me to lead an army.<br> I warn you again, your Majesty. It's<br> not common sense to trust this girl.<br> If it be God's will to deliver<br> Orleans, Why do you need soldiers?<br> The soldiers will fight and<br> God will give them victory.<br> I cound be sure... You see it's<br> myself that I'm not sure of.<br> I'm not sure I would make a good<br> King. -What you need is faith in God.<br> When you have that you<br> have faith in yourself.<br> I'm not sure God<br> wants me to be King.<br> Why should God send<br> me help, when I am...<br> what I am?<br> Put aside your doubts<br> and fears, my Dauphin.<br> Be noble as I have dream you to<br> be, be as God requires you to be,<br> be as France needs you.<br> Your France, your<br> nation and your people,<br> so helpless without<br> you, but unconquerable<br> as soon as you turn<br> your trust to God.<br> Can you look at her face<br> and doubt, my Lord? -No.<br> I do not doubt now.<br> Alenson, take her<br> to the captains.<br> God is with this girl,<br> and will be with<br> her in battle.<br> Gentlemen, I present<br> you Joan the maid.<br> This is Antel,<br> Couvert,<br> Poulon,<br> Derrogaux,<br> Serseraille,<br> and this is Laire.<br> Hah! By the wild bull of Bujon! It's<br> a girl... and in harness! Hahaha!<br> Laire takes pride<br> in being a plain<br> blood fellow without<br> polish for anybody,<br> so think nothing of his<br> greeting. He fights well.<br> If he fights well,<br> I shall like him.<br> If I'm a fool, God at least<br> does not held it against me.<br> Joan I promise you, that<br> so long as you don't try<br> to give any commands, we<br> shall all get along well.<br> Oh, I shall not try<br> to give any commands?<br> I wouldn't know what<br> commands to give.<br> By the rock of Moses, that's the first<br> sensible word I heard you say, wench!<br> You stick to that and<br> by the thunders of God<br> there will be no trouble.<br> -Don't swear, Laire.<br> Don't swear?<br> Now, by the black rock<br> of... -There must be<br> no swearing in this<br> army among high or low.<br> Do you want to<br> strike the army dumb?<br> This must begin with you. -You<br> said you would give no order, Joan.<br> Oh, but this is not<br> a military order, sir.<br> Surely you must see that.<br> But the army that is to march on<br> Orleans was raised in a holy cause.<br> I saw the men today,<br> there were women among<br> them, they drank and swore.<br> These things must cease and every man<br> must go to confession before we march.<br> Before God...<br> -Don't swear, Laire.<br> But if you must,<br> swear by my staff.<br> By my staff? What kind<br> of an oath is that?<br> No army was ever<br> sent to confession.<br> If we gave such orders,<br> we'll be laughed at.<br> I shall give no such command! -Or<br> any of us, you may be sure of that.<br> By the swords of Lazarus!<br> What war have it's leaders had to sit<br> in council with a green country girl?<br> a pat on that silly<br> Dauphin of ours.<br> Bad enough when he was a plain coward.<br> Now he sends children to lead us.<br> She's not to lead<br> us, you great ark.<br> She's to ride before us as a<br> sort of symbol, a figurehead<br> for the soldiers to rally<br> around. -No by the love of Janice<br> and all his 2 face Janissaries,<br> she will not rally me around.<br> I don't expect she be<br> of much help in battle,<br> Nevertheless I'm grateful<br> to her. -For what?<br> For giving us another chance.<br> Do you play this game often?<br> Every day all day.<br> That takes it all.<br> From now on there won't<br> be much time for games.<br> It's the maid. -The maid.<br> The maid... the one we follow.<br> -Is it something we can do perhaps?<br> Yes. Pick up your<br> dice for a moment.<br> Pick up your dice, my friend.<br> They tell me that armies<br> are like this, that all<br> armies are like this and that<br> there is no changing them.<br> Yet we cannot have victory<br> we are not worthy of it.<br> But we came here because<br> you promised victory.<br> It is true that God has called<br> us to the work we are to do,<br> but it is not enough<br> that God is on our side,<br> we must be on his side.<br> What are we to do, maid?<br> There must be no gambling.<br> No gambling? -No,<br> not even in secret.<br> And you must not swear and<br> take God's name in vain.<br> What was that? -No<br> swearing the maid said.<br> And you must send<br> away all your women.<br> What? What's that? -No women.<br> There must be no camp<br> followers. -She means us.<br> And before we march each<br> man must go to confession<br> and clear his soul of<br> all evil he has done.<br> What does she<br> thinks we are? Monks?<br> Be quiet! -Let her speak!<br> Please hear me.<br> As many as can.<br> You see, there is<br> no strength in me.<br> And no strength in my hands.<br> There is no strength<br> in any of our hands<br> great enough to win<br> against the English.<br> Our strength is in our faith.<br> And if our faith is eaten away by<br> little things that God hates then,<br> so there be a million of us,<br> we shall be beaten back and die.<br> Yes, come near!<br> And you men too!<br> And those who cannot hear!<br> Give them this message!<br> We can win only if<br> we become God's army.<br> It is not easy to stand here<br> before you, and ask this of you.<br> Perhaps it will<br> not be easy to do.<br> But I know that if<br> these things are done<br> then though the English<br> hang from the clouds<br> and ride on the whirlwind,<br> we shall beat them.<br> Though their arrows fall<br> like hail from the sky<br> and their spears<br> be a ring of steel<br> and their cannons speak and strike<br> like the thunderstorm from heaven,<br> yet they shall be ours!<br> For this, God has promised.<br> Our father who is in<br> heaven is our leader.<br> He will be with us,<br> while we hallow his name.<br> He will give us all we need.<br> Our daily bread,<br> our victory and the land<br> that is forever free.<br> Why are we on this side of<br> the river if that is Orleans?<br> You've come this way<br> for order of Dunois.<br> Bastard of Orleans.<br> -He commands here?<br> Yes, girl. That must be he<br> riding out to welcome you.<br> Greetings Dunois.<br> -Greetings, my Lord.<br> You're most heartedly<br> welcomed, my friends.<br> More so since you<br> bring the maid with you.<br> This is the hour.<br> Now is the time.<br> In God's name,<br> strike! Strike boldly!<br> Forward! -Forward!<br> Forward!<br> Forward! -Fire!<br> Fire! Fire!<br> Forward! Man the slits!<br> Get those cannoneers!<br> Fire the catapults!<br> Fire!<br> Hurry with the meurtriere!<br> Follow the white banner!<br> Forward! For God and<br> our country, forward!<br> Follow the banner!<br> God is with you<br> all, Lords! All!<br> Fire!<br> Break thru the walls!<br> Close with them!<br> In God's name, forward!<br> The witch, the witch!<br> Stay there, coward!<br> Forward, my friends, forward!<br> Up and over!<br> France! France! God<br> is your protector!<br> Forward! Forward!<br> Brave men, good<br> soldiers, hurry!<br> On the walls!<br> Archer!<br> Hurry men! Altogether,<br> to the walls!<br> I hit the witch!<br> She's down, she's down!<br> She's down, the witch is down!<br> Victory, England has won!<br> That must come out, Joan.<br> Hold my amulet, maid. It<br> will conjure away your pain.<br> Thank you, my<br> friend. No, no thanks.<br> I rather die than use sorcery.<br> I'll cleanse your wound with<br> ointment, dress it with lard.<br> Yes. Bind me.<br> And I lie here... for a while.<br> Father Pasquerel, do you hear.<br> The Tourre has fallen. -No,<br> Joan. That's the note for recall.<br> We've been ordered to retreat.<br> Help me to my harness.<br> -Child, you are wounded.<br> I don't feel it.<br> No! No, men of<br> France! Do not give up!<br> Courage men, do not fallback!<br> Laire, Dunois,<br> Alenson, turn back!<br> Friends, come with me.<br> We must not give up.<br> We've done all we can this day,<br> Joan, our men are exhausted.<br> The English are just as exhausted. -We<br> held a council and decided to retreat.<br> You've been with your council<br> and I've been with mine.<br> And I say to you, the council of our<br> Lord is better and stronger than yours.<br> We need only to go forward<br> and the fort is ours!<br> If she wants to<br> attack, we attack.<br> When my banner<br> touches the wall<br> we shall have victory! -Sound<br> the trumpets, forward men!<br> Forward! Follow the banner!<br> On your feet!<br> Do not give up!<br> For the glory of France!<br> To the walls! To the walls!<br> French men, French men!<br> There is no turning back!<br> We shall have<br> victory, God wills it!<br> To the walls! -To the walls!<br> Scale the ladder!<br> France, rise above!<br> Death to the enemy!<br> Forward men, this<br> is the victory!<br> Resist!<br> Enter boldly,<br> victory shall be ours!<br> God say yield! God say yield!<br> God say yield! Yield<br> to redeem your life!<br> God say yield to<br> redeem your life!<br> I'll never yield to<br> you, sorceress witch!<br> You call me harlot,<br> but I have great pity<br> on your soul and the<br> souls of your men!<br> Yield to the King of heaven!<br> I say never! Not to<br> you, fiend from hell!<br> No, no, no!<br> Burn in hell!<br> Death by fire is<br> a horrible thing.<br> Joan! Joan, we've<br> been looking for you.<br> Why are you crying?<br> I thought victory<br> would be beautiful.<br> Look at this so<br> ugly and bloody.<br> Why it was never a more<br> beautiful victory than this.<br> And it's your victory. The whole<br> city is waiting to receive you.<br> You must lead the army<br> through the streets. -No!<br> Our soldiers see her<br> banner and run away.<br> Her victories will be remembered as<br> the most shameful episode of history.<br> I quite agree with you.<br> Mighty England<br> and great Burgundy,<br> the richest prince in Christendom,<br> beaten by a green country girl.<br> My Lord, did you come<br> to me for aid and advice,<br> I have this to<br> say: think, Duke.<br> Think carefully before you<br> reject the maid and her invitation<br> to the coronation<br> of your dear cousin.<br> This no moment for jesting,<br> Count of Luxembourg.<br> And no subject toyed.<br> The fact remains that tomorrow<br> in the Catherdral of Reims<br> the maid will crown her dancing<br> master, the Dauphin, King of France.<br> She's victorious and she<br> has made no mistakes so far.<br> If she decides to march on<br> Pars, and no doubt she will,<br> Paris will be lost...<br> and we'll fall.<br> This is a grave moment in<br> the history of Burgundy.<br> And of England.<br> -And of the church.<br> We had to deal with many heretics,<br> but none as dangerous as this one.<br> The maid a heretic?<br> I thought the church<br> had examined her<br> and found her good,<br> pious and untouched.<br> If I had sat as<br> judge of Poitiers,<br> I can assure you the verdict<br> would have been different.<br> Count Bishop your hatred<br> for the maid is justified.<br> Had she chased me from<br> my castle or I was noticed<br> I would have called her much<br> worst names... than a heretic.<br> It may be luck for us that<br> she's exactly where she is.<br> Luck? -She's about to<br> make her first error.<br> Tomorrow she will crown Charles. She<br> should set the crown on her own head.<br> Charles is a fool, a gull, a<br> knave. He sold out to us before.<br> He may do it again.<br> -You offer him money?<br> Not I, you. For a truce.<br> For first time in a 100<br> years France is victorious,<br> Why in heaven's name should<br> Charles grant us a truce?<br> Dangle gold in front of him and<br> he might take it, he always has.<br> Tremouille is<br> with him as usual.<br> And Tremouille<br> would sell anything.<br> Very well my Lord, I'll<br> send the messenger away.<br> Messenger? What<br> messenger? -By Burgundy.<br> He's here begging for a<br> truce. -Truce? What nonsense.<br> How much will they pay? -50,000 crowns<br> if you give the order to stop fighting.<br> And how much do you get? -I?<br> I... I've nothing to do with it.<br> Your usual share is half, my loving<br> crocodile and you haven't changed.<br> I want your share. I<br> want 100,000 in my hands.<br> And I'm not even sure<br> that I'll take it.<br> What shall I tell him?<br> You tell him to wait,<br> we are in no hurry.<br> Very well, my Lord.<br> Sire,<br> this is the day we fought for<br> and waited for and it has come.<br> I'm as happy as any<br> mortal has ever been,<br> for I've watched the anointing<br> and the coronation of my King.<br> Hurray! -Long live the King!<br> Long live the King!<br> Joan the Maid!<br> Joan the maid! On to Paris!<br> I'll see the messenger<br> in the robing room.<br> Oh, they didn't touch, they didn't<br> touch. -They kissed, they kissed.<br> Just as I kiss you now.<br> Your Majesty...<br> -Only our kissing is a<br> very different matter<br> isn't it, my dear?<br> Oh, your Majesty, you must take care.<br> -No, that's your part to take care.<br> Mine is to be bold,<br> careless and reckless.<br> To win the world I win<br> and depart when I choose.<br> For look, the world is<br> mine. Look about you,<br> this is a real court now and<br> I'm a King to be reckoned with.<br> It is lovely, the<br> scent of jasmine.<br> I could stay here<br> in Sully forever.<br> Yes, well next week we must<br> go to Lausa to be feasted,<br> And the week<br> after that to Pion.<br> There seems to be no<br> end to these invitations.<br> And to the tributes!<br> See?<br> And for the reference, do<br> you remember that little<br> tailor at Chinon who wouldn't<br> trust me for a new coat?<br> Now... Nay, here comes<br> that vulture again.<br> Well Tremouille, do you come to bring<br> me money? Or to take it away with you?<br> Your Majesty, this is a much<br> more important matter than money.<br> The man's mad. Here, take<br> my place. And don't cheat!<br> She's here. -Is she alone?<br> No, she brought<br> Alenson with her.<br> Remember Sire, it's<br> absolutely imperative<br> that this time<br> you keep your word.<br> When have I not kept<br> my word? -Yesterday.<br> Well, that was yesterday.<br> Greetings, my friends.<br> Joan, we've asked you<br> into the presence because<br> we've missed you, our<br> most favourite subject.<br> My noble King, for<br> weeks we have waited<br> outside the walls of<br> Paris for your arrival.<br> We should have struck<br> in the hour of victory.<br> But it is not too late now.<br> Keep your promise.<br> Ride with us and<br> Paris shall yet be ours.<br> I'm sorry Joan, but you've<br> to cancel all such plans.<br> I have just negotiated a<br> truce with Burgundy. -A truce?<br> That's madness. -It's<br> been too much bloodshed.<br> The Tourre has been<br> terribly torn, we need peace.<br> Our enemies need peace,<br> my King, but not you.<br> Let them go home to their island and<br> they can have a good and lasting peace.<br> We only have to<br> go forward now.<br> And their last great<br> stronghold will fall.<br> I tell you I have<br> decided upon a truce.<br> I have decided.<br> But you cannot<br> do this, my King.<br> It would mean that you threw<br> away all the advantages.<br> We have fought so hard and<br> have given so much blood to win.<br> His Majesty has signed<br> the truce. -Signed it?<br> Yes.<br> And our King never<br> repudiates his word.<br> You know how this<br> looks, your Highness?<br> Like betrayal or<br> stupidity. Or both!<br> I never said that I<br> was wise, I never said<br> I was honest, I never<br> said I was handsome.<br> I'm not a particularly<br> good person to be a King,<br> but as long as I am a<br> King, I will be a King.<br> What do you know statecraft?<br> What do you know of the experience<br> which the heads of nations must stoop?<br> A ruler must compromise<br> and bargain with<br> the lowest sort of<br> people, even the enemy.<br> Men are governed by<br> corruption, they like it.<br> Men hate corruption<br> and God hates it.<br> I don't know, but men<br> take to it very naturally.<br> Cannot be true.<br> My King,<br> have you taken...<br> money from our enemies?<br> That is not a question the<br> King should answer. Or be asked.<br> Then you have done it.<br> You have betrayed us.<br> All of us.<br> Your country and<br> even yourself.<br> I shall tell the people<br> of France what you've done.<br> I hate war, I<br> don't like battles,<br> everytime I see French<br> blood flowing I can...<br> I can feel the hair<br> rise on my head.<br> With all my soul I prayed<br> for peace. -We are at peace.<br> We cannot have peace so<br> till our land is free.<br> It happens that I am<br> the one that decides<br> what war we fight and<br> what peace we keep.<br> I warn you, make any<br> dirty truce you like.<br> We'll march on Paris<br> with or without sanction.<br> No my dear cousin,<br> you will not.<br> I ordered the<br> dismissal of the army.<br> I'm sick of all these warriors<br> clanking about in armour.<br> You Alenson, Laire,<br> Dunois, all of you.<br> Put down your battleaxes,<br> you're ordered home.<br> And from now on, all<br> commands come from me.<br> If my captains leave,<br> I shall leave also.<br> Not your captains,<br> my captains.<br> And you also will do as you<br> are told. Not as you pleased.<br> About the<br> present... -Ah, yes.<br> Joan, we've decided to ennoble<br> you as a token of our gratitude.<br> And your town of Domremy<br> will be exempt from taxation.<br> But you must remain<br> with the court<br> until you are given<br> permission to leave.<br> Now come and join us.<br> We'll meet again, Joan.<br> I was never much for... words,<br> Joan. Except for profanity.<br> This is beyond swearing.<br> Goodbye, dear friend.<br> And good soldier.<br> Did you say your<br> prayers this morning?<br> That's what I forgot.<br> Remember me when you say them.<br> Joan,<br> let me kneel to you this once.<br> You are more to me than any<br> King or Queen could ever be.<br> To me you are France<br> and France is yours.<br> You lifted her up when she was dying<br> and set a cup of victory to her lips.<br> We all drank from that cup.<br> To make a new nation of us.<br> Made new men of all of us.<br> Many have fallen and now dead,<br> as I could wish I were<br> now that this has happened.<br> King of heaven,<br> I've come to fulfill a vow.<br> The truce with<br> Burgundy signed.<br> We're at peace and I shall<br> wear this white armour no more.<br> I leave it here,<br> at your altar.<br> We're at peace, my King.<br> But not such a<br> peace as we dreamed.<br> No, horribly and evil in armies,<br> this was much of the war to be fought.<br> And our enemy is preparing.<br> And we dwindle here<br> from town to town,<br> holding court.<br> Receiving embassies<br> and dismissing soldiers.<br> From town to town<br> we have feasted.<br> From city to city I have<br> attended, doing the King's bidding.<br> We must feast in many<br> more if the plan holds.<br> Oh, my sweet God,<br> the food is bitter.<br> I would rather sleep<br> on the ground again<br> and chew my handful<br> of bean and rice and to<br> face the rank of English spears, for<br> this way we shall lose all we have won.<br> Even I can see that.<br> And my voices<br> have said nothing.<br> If only my voices<br> would speak to me again.<br> If they would tell me what I should<br> do then I could sleep at night<br> and accept what comes to<br> me but they are silent.<br> I asked again and again.<br> Must I remain with the<br> King and his household?<br> Busy with the nothings<br> that fill these days?<br> If my voices do not answer,<br> I cannot stay here.<br> I must arm again and find<br> the enemy and fight as before.<br> Let my voices speak<br> to me if this is wrong.<br> Let them speak to me now.<br> There is still no answer.<br> Then I must go.<br> And fight the enemy,<br> King of heaven.<br> I shall find another<br> armour, not this<br> shining one in which I<br> rode as your messenger.<br> But another dark and humble,<br> fitting to a common soldier.<br> Long ago my voices told me<br> that I would be taken prisoner.<br> When it comes, at least I<br> shall have arms in my hands.<br> I think I have courage to die.<br> But not to die thus<br> in small sick ways.<br> Inform the master that<br> we've bring in the witch.<br> The maid is captured.<br> Come here, look!<br> There's the witch! The witch!<br> The witch is a young girl!<br> So you are the maid...<br> The peasant girl who<br> leads armies, crowns Kings,<br> and sets soldiers<br> quaking in their boots.<br> As a French men,<br> your great admirer.<br> As a Burgundian,<br> your fortunate captor.<br> At the gates of<br> Compiegne? -Yes, my Lord.<br> The city shut the<br> gates in our faces,<br> we descended upon her<br> and her few followers.<br> We were careful not to wound<br> her. -Well done, captain.<br> My dear, look after<br> her good health.<br> You shall be in good hands,<br> Joan. -They've taken my ring.<br> I want it back.<br> His Grace, the<br> Bishop of Beauvals.<br> Welcome, your Grace.<br> -Greetings, Count.<br> A cup of wine? Wine is<br> always good over a bargain.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Seems to me, I remember this room<br> under less happy circumstances.<br> Yes, I remember you<br> were a bit breathless.<br> You were running<br> from the maid.<br> Whom you now have.<br> -Whom I now have.<br> Shall I have the<br> money sent up?<br> enough, your Grace.<br> I can do much<br> better elsewhere.<br> great deal of money.<br> Kings have been<br> ransomed for less.<br> But this is something different, this<br> is a witch. Witches are expensive.<br> I've use 10 bags.<br> The question is does each bag<br> contains 500 or 1,000 pounds.<br> Bishop, could it be<br> possible that you're lying?<br> It looks to me as if you're authorised<br> to go as high as 10,000 pounds.<br> If I said that I were,<br> you would want 15.<br> If you're a true christain,<br> you'd give her up for nothing.<br> She's a sorceress, a<br> heretic! An idolatress!<br> She must be burned. -Oh<br> now, now... wait Bishop.<br> If this is entirely a religious matter,<br> why do you offer me English coin?<br> England is a true<br> daughter of our church.<br> She's with us heart and soul, in<br> the matter of scorching this heresy.<br> Oh, yes. When the<br> maid beat the English.<br> Yes of course,<br> that was heresy.<br> Not to mention her putting<br> you out of your Bishoping.<br> Whose side are you on, my friend?<br> -This same side we're all on.<br> The me side, what's in it for me.<br> That's my side, and that's your side.<br> And the English side,<br> and the French side,<br> and the Burgundian<br> side. Of course...<br> this girl, she's the only one I<br> know who is not on the me side.<br> And that's why I'm ashamed<br> when I think I would sell her.<br> Yes, even for 10,000 gold pounds.<br> -Very well, 10,000. Will you take it?<br> If I am not, may<br> God put me there.<br> If I am me, may<br> he keep me there.<br> That is a good answer, Joan.<br> We can do without<br> your comments.<br> Who council you to throw off<br> womens clothes and dress like a man?<br> A thing indecent... and contrary to<br> the teachings of the holy scriptures.<br> For that I blame no one.<br> Having lived among soldiers it was more<br> fitting for me to wear mens clothes.<br> But give me a woman's dress and I will<br> wear it if you permit me to hear mass.<br> Otherwise I will not put it on since<br> it pleases God that I wear this one.<br> All I have done, I've done<br> by the command of my Lord.<br> That is all that<br> I've done well.<br> How do you know that<br> your voices come from God?<br> I knew that they<br> came from God because<br> what they commanded<br> me to do was only good.<br> My Lords, I have answered the<br> same questions at Poitiers.<br> My King charged the<br> Archbishop of Reims<br> and other loyal<br> and learned priest<br> to examine me before I was<br> allowed to lead his army.<br> Send for the records at Poitiers,<br> you shall have all my answers.<br> The examination at Poiters by the<br> Archbishop of Reims has no relevance.<br> We are your judges now<br> and you must answer us!<br> But you are not<br> fitted to be my judges.<br> You are my mortal enemies.<br> English... and Burgurdians.<br> All of you.<br> And you are not the church.<br> You are the valets of the enemy<br> King whose orders you obeyed.<br> If I am being<br> tried by the church,<br> why am I not in a church<br> prison among women.<br> I am in a English prison guarded<br> by English soldiers and chained...<br> chained to my bed. If I must rise<br> for any purpose I must ask the guards<br> to unlock the bonds.<br> We, your judges, keep you chained<br> because you've attempted to escape.<br> Is it not the right of all<br> prisoners of war to try to escape?<br> You say that you<br> are my judges.<br> I do not know if you<br> are, but I say this,<br> take care not to<br> judge me wrongly,<br> for in truth I am sent by God and<br> you place yourself in great danger.<br> Take her back to her cell!<br> Good day, my Lords.<br> You and your flawless trial.<br> The girl's too clever for<br> you! She ridicules you!<br> Yes and threatens you<br> in public. -I can assure<br> you, my dear Warwick.<br> It won't happen again.<br> No it will not, for there will<br> be no more public sessions.<br> You will continue behind closed<br> doors according to my orders.<br> Is that the chapel, Father?<br> Yes, Joan. -May I enter?<br> No daughter, it is forbidden.<br> Do you know why?<br> It is forbidden.<br> Your Grace,<br> perhaps we should not<br> say no so quickly to this<br> child's request concerning<br> the records of Poitiers.<br> Since we were not on the maid's side<br> in the war, we can hardly judge her...<br> in unbiased fashion. -This<br> is an ecclesiastical court,<br> governed solely by the<br> unbiased laws of the church.<br> The laws of the church?<br> Do they demand English<br> guards at the doors?<br> Do they insist that English<br> gold bears the expense?<br> Silence Calleis.<br> -No, your Grace.<br> Such a procedure<br> contravenes our laws.<br> I can take no part in this<br> trial. -Then you may leave.<br> And any of you who herd<br> his opinion may leave also.<br> But remember this,<br> if you go now, you<br> carry my enmity with you.<br> And the enmity of<br> the King of England.<br> The King of<br> France and England.<br> I'm sorry to leave what to your<br> mercy. Or your lack of mercy.<br> But for my conscience<br> sake I cannot witness what<br> seems to me but a preconceived<br> and shameful farce.<br> You will come with us.<br> I? -Yes. You're under arrest.<br> I should be in<br> a church prison,<br> guarded by women.<br> Must you leave<br> me here, Father?<br> I'm commanded to<br> leave you here.<br> God keep you, child.<br> Joan, this is<br> Master Jean Laverne,<br> who has been assigned by the<br> most revered Inquisitor of France.<br> to assist us at you trial.<br> Master Jean has read all the<br> reports of the preceding sessions.<br> And is therefore well<br> acquainted with your case.<br> I am Jean and I promise you<br> that we will judge you justly.<br> But you're an illiterate<br> girl and need council.<br> You may choose one of<br> the judges to advise you.<br> I thank you.<br> But I have no intention of departing<br> from the council of my Lord.<br> What do your voices tell you?<br> To answer you boldly.<br> Did they promise<br> to deliver you?<br> Saint Catherine told me<br> that I would be rescued.<br> I do not know whether<br> this means that I would be<br> delivered by a French<br> attack upon this city Rouen.<br> Or something else,<br> but I was told that I would<br> be freed by a great victory.<br> Can you remember the<br> exact words? -Yes.<br> Accept everything<br> with courage.<br> Do not fear your martyrdom.<br> For in the end, you shall be<br> in the kingdom of paradise.<br> What does the voice mean by...<br> your martyrdom?<br> I...<br> I am not sure.<br> It may mean what I<br> suffer here in prison.<br> Night after night, I<br> have no sleep and still<br> I must come before you<br> and answer questions.<br> Same questions.<br> Come before you've met with<br> what I must endure in my cell.<br> Without...<br> without rest, without<br> rest, day or night.<br> I do not know how much<br> more I would have to suffer.<br> I reave for myself to God.<br> This harlot mocks our court!<br> You ask me questions I<br> have sworn not to answer,<br> and yet you keep asking them.<br> What do you wish of me<br> that I perjure myself?<br> Scriveners, stay your hand.<br> Don't write that answer.<br> Joan, if we proof to you that<br> you have acted against the faith,<br> are you ready to<br> submit to the church?<br> I beg you to believe that,<br> I would never do or say<br> anything against the church.<br> And if I have done such a thing<br> I would willingly reject it.<br> That is a good<br> answer Joan. Now I...<br> If you accept the<br> decision of this court,<br> you would reject your voices.<br> If you still maintain that your voices<br> are right, you reject the church.<br> If you do not obey,<br> you are a heretic!<br> I would not reject the voices<br> of my Lord nor the church!<br> It seems to me<br> that it is all one.<br> Our Lord and our church.<br> Why do you make such<br> a difficulty about it?<br> Why did you display your<br> banner at the coronation?<br> It had shared in the toil.<br> It was only right that it<br> should share in the honour.<br> I appeal to the<br> Pope who is at Rome.<br> Take me there and I<br> shall submit to him.<br> Silence! -Silence!<br> This is very serious, my Lord.<br> She is within her rights.<br> -This appeal is expensive.<br> We cannot proceed with the<br> trial. -We shall proceed.<br> But if we were to continue, the trial<br> would be illegal and the verdict null.<br> You're saved, Joan. -The<br> devil's tail, Priest!<br> If I see you whisper to her again<br> I'll have you thrown into the Seine.<br> As for this appeal to the<br> Pope, I refuse to allow it.<br> The King commands<br> here, not the Pope.<br> He's paid a high<br> price for this witch.<br> And he's also paying for<br> your services, my Masters,<br> Doctors and Bishops.<br> That is why I appeal to the Pope,<br> who takes orders from no King.<br> The appeal is overruled.<br> Erase it from the record!<br> Yes, you surely write what is<br> against me but nothing that is for me.<br> Take her away!<br> May I have your<br> attention, my Lords?<br> His Grace, the<br> Bishop of Beauvals,<br> send me the articles of<br> accusation of this case,<br> and ask me to give him my opinion<br> of the conduct of this trial.<br> I assure your Grace, but<br> I would hardly hope that<br> you would trouble yourself<br> to appear in person.<br> I fear that my letter might become<br> lost, as so many others have.<br> However, having<br> witness today's session,<br> I am ready to<br> render my opinion.<br> Write this down, Scriveners.<br> I, Jean, Bishop of Avranche,<br> declared that this trial is unlawful.<br> That the appeal<br> made by the accused<br> and witnessed by me among others, is<br> definitely and completely suspensive.<br> And that all future<br> procedure of this case<br> must be referred to Rome.<br> Why don't we go to my apartment...<br> -If the maid's appeal is overruled,<br> it is further proof of<br> the widespread rumours<br> that circulate throughout<br> the Christain world<br> that this is not a religious<br> but a political trial.<br> I warn you, you<br> the so call judges,<br> you may suceed in<br> sending her to the stake.<br> But one day, your English King will<br> be ashamed of these proceedings.<br> Rome will declare the<br> truth about this girl.<br> And France will praise the maid<br> for it's birth as one nation.<br> And as for you, Pierre Cauchon,<br> Count Bishop of Beauvals,<br> I declare you a<br> traitor, for you have<br> betrayed your country<br> and you betrayed...<br> your church.<br> Your Grace, at this<br> time I cannot permit...<br> I will not permit...<br> Tomorrow morning, in<br> the cemetery of St Ouen,<br> we've decided to<br> hold our last session.<br> With your physician's consent,<br> we are taking Joan there.<br> And if she again refuses to<br> abjure, we're abandoning her<br> and handing her over to<br> the civil authorities.<br> I shall order the execution<br> under being readiness.<br> This Joan, whom<br> you see before you,<br> has fallen from<br> error into error,<br> from crime into crime.<br> Never before in France has<br> there appear such a monster.<br> She's a witch, a<br> heretic, a schismatic<br> even her King himself is a<br> heretic, because he sort to<br> regain his throne<br> with the help of such an apostate,<br> we brought you here to this<br> sacred and divinest cemetary to<br> give you your last chance in public.<br> Will you or will you not revoke all<br> the acts to which your voices drove you<br> and which where your<br> judges have condemned?<br> Burn the witch!<br> Burn the witch!<br> I submit to God and our<br> holy Father the Pope.<br> The Pope is in Rome,<br> we cannot go so far.<br> You must submit to us.<br> If you do not, we shall hand<br> you over to the executioner now<br> I submit to God and our<br> holy Father the Pope.<br> You must submit to us or die.<br> If you submit, we'll send<br> you to a church prison.<br> Do you hear, Joan. If you<br> submit, you'll be taken<br> to a church prison where<br> there will be women guard.<br> Joan,<br> he's reading the sentence<br> of your excommunication.<br> Submit.<br> This means her<br> death. -Abjure, Joan!<br> Abjure!<br> Abjure!<br> Abjure?<br> What does it mean to abjure?<br> It means to submit<br> to your judges.<br> If you do, you'll<br> escape the fire and<br> you'll be delivered<br> from the English prison.<br> Almost, sweet God.<br> Submit! Submit!<br> Abjure Joan! -Abjure!<br> Abjure! -Please abjure!<br> Save yourself!<br> Save yourself, Joan!<br> I submit<br> my words and actions to you.<br> I'll abjure than be burned. -She<br> submits herself! She submits!<br> Damn!<br> No, Joan. You'll<br> sign your name.<br> Silence!<br> The maid has submitted.<br> We must receive<br> her with penitence.<br> In the name of our Lord, Amen.<br> At last, you've come back to<br> the bosom of our mother church.<br> And thus we absolve you<br> from the excommunication.<br> But in order that you<br> should expiate your crimes.<br> And to make sure that you<br> would not fall back into heresy,<br> we condemn you to<br> perpetual prison,<br> to the bread and sorrow,<br> and the water of affliction.<br> Father, take me to<br> your church prison.<br> Give me women to guard me.<br> No! No!<br> They told me they would<br> take me to church prison!<br> Oh! They lied to<br> me! They lied to me!<br> No!<br> Oh, sweet God.<br> Forgive me. Forgive me.<br> I was afraid.<br> What I said...<br> was for fear of the fire.<br> I have damned my soul<br> to save my life.<br> You speak to me,<br> and I denied you.<br> Exactly as I expected.<br> She has not kept her word.<br> She meant nothing of what she<br> said. -She meant all that she said.<br> But we have not dealt<br> honestly with her.<br> The guards are still<br> here, just as before.<br> She has retained<br> the clothes of a man.<br> She has broken her<br> signed abjuration!<br> We made it impossible<br> for her to keep it.<br> You exceed your function here!<br> -I appeal to the Inquisitor.<br> She shall have her sentence and<br> nothing else. -One moment, my Lords.<br> If this girl has been<br> tricked into breaking her vow,<br> I will not share in a<br> sentence against her.<br> If we leave your<br> cell, all of us,<br> will you put on this dress?<br> No, my Lord, I will not.<br> I've heard my voices again.<br> They told me I did<br> a very wicked thing<br> by denying them but<br> they have forgiven me.<br> I have faith in them.<br> I have none in you.<br> This is a fatal answer.<br> Joan,<br> Do you know what this means?<br> To live without faith<br> is more terrible than<br> the fire, more terrible<br> than dying young.<br> I have nothing<br> more to do here.<br> Send me back to<br> God for whom I came.<br> Only a child!<br> Someone save her!<br> Save her! -Back away!<br> Back away! Back away!<br> You, the devil Bishop!<br> In the name of our Lord, Amen.<br> Could I have a cross!<br> To hold in my hands!<br> Ah, what shame that<br> after the abjuration<br> of your errors,<br> the devil of heresy<br> has once more<br> risen in your heart.<br> You've returned to your crimes,<br> therefore we the judges same decree<br> that you, Joan,<br> commonly called the maid,<br> have been on the subject of your<br> pretended divine revelations.<br> A relapsed heretic,<br> -God bless you.<br> a sorceress, lying, seducing,<br> pernicious, presumptuous, seditious,<br> cruel, apostate<br> and schismatic.<br> And so we abandon you<br> to the civil authorities,<br> requesting the same<br> authority that it<br> may be pleased to<br> moderate its judgement<br> and if true signs of<br> penitence should appear<br> that the sacrament of penance<br> may be administered to you.<br> I am a good Christain.<br> Executioner! Do your duty!<br> Thus the short life of<br> Joan nearing its end.<br> But the truth will emerge<br> in the pages of history.<br> Her physical death<br> was not a defeat<br> but her last and<br> greatest triumph.<br> Father, pray for me.<br> I will be damned forever,<br> I've burned a Saint!<br> Go,<br> child of God,<br> daughter of France!<br> Go.<br> Go! -Oh, sweet God.<br> You've been with me always.<br> Be with me now,<br> through the darkness.<br> For I meant to hurt no one.<br> Let none be hurt for me.<br> Come to her assistance,<br> she sings of God.<br> Come forth to meet her,<br> the angels of the Lord.<br> Receiving her soul, offering<br> it in the side of the almighty.<br> May Christ receive<br> you with choralty<br> and may the angels<br> lead thee to paradise.<br> And... and that the hour<br> of our death... amen.<br> Jesus.<br> Jesus!<br>
