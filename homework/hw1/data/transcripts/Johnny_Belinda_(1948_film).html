                        The island of Cape Breton,<br> the northeastern end of Nova Scotia...<br> is just a small chunk of land<br> sticking out into the Atlantic.<br> Roads haven't been built through<br> everywhere yet.<br> You mostly have to come in from the sea.<br> It needs an old hand to navigate<br> through the shoals offshore...<br> especially during the storms that come up<br> suddenly in the summertime...<br> and the little lighthouse<br> has saved many a life.<br> The village isn't much to shout about.<br> Just a quiet, peaceful place where<br> the people are proud of their church...<br> built with their own hands and what<br> little money they could scrape up.<br> Their farms don't bring in much...<br> but for a few months each year<br> when the cod are running...<br> there's a lot of excitement.<br> You should see the harbor then,<br> alive with boats.<br> They leave the women to take care<br> of the potatoes and livestock...<br> and put out to sea.<br> Not many of them are lucky enough<br> to have their own boat...<br> but they all get a share<br> when the catch is paid for at the cannery.<br> A fair-sized haul means everything.<br> It means food for the long winter...<br> new blades for tools,<br> grain bought for cattle.<br> That's why we watch each vessel<br> as she comes in...<br> to see how low she sets in the water.<br> Floyd, come on back here<br> and give us a hand with these fish.<br> Fergus, tack in on that line.<br> Help get this catch ashore.<br> Get that unloading net aboard.<br> -How many drags did you make?<br> -Two, three hours.<br> Take it away.<br> Get that boom over.<br> Don't tie it off, get it back onboard.<br> I don't want to hang around all day<br> on this reeking wharf.<br> -Look out!<br> -Hook's in his shoulder.<br> Hey, Dan'I!<br> -Do you know where the doctor is?<br> -Sure, he's dead.<br> No, the new doctor. Same place. Get.<br> Hurry up, bring him back, quick.<br> Come on, get going before this load<br> starts stinking the place up.<br> Yes?<br> I got to get the doctor.<br> Tim's been hurt down at the boat.<br> What is it, Stella?<br> There's a boy out here says a man's<br> been hurt down at the wharf.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Will you be giving me<br> some medicine, doctor?<br> No, Mrs. Poggety, just this diet list.<br> I think you'd better<br> have your teeth X-rayed.<br> -Oh, but Dr. Peterson always said--<br> -I'm not Dr. Peterson.<br> But what do my teeth to do<br> with my backache?<br> Well, it's taken medicine a good<br> many years to define that connection...<br> and I haven't time, unfortunately,<br> right now to explain it all to you.<br> Stella will take care of your things.<br> -Will you be back to supper?<br> -I don't know.<br> -When can I go back to work?<br> -No time at all.<br> The main thing is to see<br> there's no infection.<br> Would you like to put his coat on?<br> I'll take him in the buggy.<br> Hello, darling.<br> Hey, Locky. Going to the dance Saturday?<br> -Why? Your Gus going out with the fleet?<br> -I'll be on the wharf tonight.<br> Well, don't catch cold.<br> -So long, girls.<br> -Bye, Locky.<br> I looked for you, McCormick.<br> One half the fish you land yesterday<br> are undersize like little sardines.<br> Well, at 14 cents a pound I can't be<br> bothered sorting them. I'd starve to death.<br> If the buyer see them<br> he will not take them from me.<br> Well, boost your price<br> and I'll toss back the little ones.<br> And while we're talking about it...<br> -you miserable old skinflint....<br> -What's that?<br> Don't get your hackles up,<br> you Micmac Indian...<br> not with that tub of guts.<br> -Micmac?<br> -Micmac! You'd not last two rounds.<br> It's about time<br> somebody took you down a peg.<br> You sell our catch for fancy prices...<br> yet you knock down 12 cents the pound<br> on us farmers.<br> You do not like that?<br> Well now, you listen to me,<br> Mr. Locky McCormick...<br> you owe big bill in my store.<br> You know that.<br> Well, you pay or I take your stinky boat.<br> Why, you greasy old half-breed.<br> You try and take that boat<br> and I'll gut you out like a cod.<br> You keep your hands to yourself.<br> Pretty tony since you're working<br> for His Lordship, huh?<br> You mind your own business.<br> I've got to get supper ready.<br> I don't like to see you<br> working for this man, Stella.<br> He's a fine doctor. He's a....<br> Anyway he's something big.<br> Something even you can't pronounce.<br> Probably something not fit to mention.<br> What're you working your head off for,<br> anyhow?<br> What good's a dead uncle<br> if you don't use his money?<br> No hurry.<br> Plenty can happen between now<br> and the time the deeds will be signed.<br> You going to try to run it yourself?<br> That's a good farm, needs a man.<br> -We could make a lot out of that place.<br> -We?<br> Sure, I've been thinking things over.<br> You and me make a great pair.<br> We ought to get married,<br> the sooner, the better.<br> Well, this is a surprise,<br> Mr. Locky McCormick.<br> Blow your nose, don't look so silly.<br> Oh, Stella...<br> what dress you wearing<br> to the dance Saturday? The one I like?<br> Maybe.<br> -You're taking me then?<br> -Well, of course I am.<br> Fergus put in for it first.<br> We practiced a step for the jig contest.<br> I'm taking you.<br> He and Floyd can toss a coin to see<br> who dances with you, but I'm taking you.<br> The doctor's coming.<br> You'd better get out of here.<br> He's in my way.<br> -You're coming down to the wharf later?<br> -Might.<br> Thank you.<br> -Is the doctor in?<br> -He's eating his supper.<br> I've got to see him. She's awful bad.<br> I'll tell him as soon as he's finished<br> but I can't--<br> Stella?<br> -What is it?<br> -It's only Aggie MacDonald from the mill.<br> Nobody has anything to do with them...<br> and it's never a penny of pay<br> you'll get from her.<br> Well, she said someone was sick,<br> didn't she?<br> I didn't like bothering you,<br> but she's having so much trouble.<br> -The pain's that strong.<br> -I'll get my bag.<br> He didn't come at night last time.<br> It's 12 miles to the veterinary.<br> It's our cow,<br> she's the only good one we've got.<br> We'll fix her up.<br> He wouldn't have wanted me<br> to call you, Black wouldn't.<br> He'll say it costs money...<br> but if the critter dies,<br> then it's me who's to blame.<br> I'll do all I can to help.<br> In there.<br> Would you hold the light<br> a little higher, please?<br> She can't hear you. She's deaf, dumb.<br> That's too bad.<br> What she don't know don't hurt her none.<br> -By the way, it's a girl.<br> -Aye.<br> -Thanks for coming.<br> -Glad to help.<br> -Was she born deaf?<br> -No...<br> she took sick<br> when she was about a year old.<br> Come time to talk, no sound come out.<br> She growed up that way, dumb.<br> Blessing she has<br> such a fine father and mother.<br> That ain't her mother.<br> It's my sister, Aggie.<br> Her mother's dead. She killed her.<br> She died in childbed.<br> I guess sometimes it's meant to be.<br> Sometimes it's easier<br> to lose someone that way...<br> than to lose them when they're still alive.<br> I was in love with a girl.<br> She married another man.<br> I was wondering. A young chap like you,<br> burying himself here.<br> The other doctors was always old.<br> That was part of it.<br> There were lots of other things.<br> It's a pretty stale story.<br> Way things were going,<br> I sort of got fed up.<br> So I decided to look for another way.<br> Simple life, simple things.<br> If people would only learn<br> to let each other live...<br> it would be a different world.<br> What's the fee?<br> I wouldn't know.<br> I never delivered a heifer before.<br> I might take it out<br> in fishing in that pool of yours.<br> Looks like a wonderful place for trout.<br> -You're welcome anytime.<br> -Thanks.<br> Good morning, Stella.<br> I was early so I stopped in to tidy up a bit.<br> The dishes....<br> Please don't bother.<br> -Are you going out?<br> -For a little while.<br> That's a nice dress. New, isn't it?<br> -I made it myself. I make all my own--<br> -Very pretty.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> We may have fish for dinner.<br> I like fish.<br> I've got the most wonderful way of--<br> No guarantees.<br> Look, Mrs. Lutz, the new doctor.<br> He hasn't been to church once<br> in three whole months.<br> Nice example.<br> He's a fine doctor. What he did for my Tim.<br> She's always talking about,<br> ''He's a fine doctor...''<br> just because he put a bandage on a cut.<br> Hello?<br> Here, let me help you. Hello.<br> Now, where do they go?<br> Oh, the chickens.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> You watch me talk.<br> That is a...<br> rooster.<br> And these are...<br> hens.<br> Very good.<br> That's a tree.<br> Tree.<br> Yes.<br> Water.<br> Very good. Now if you give...<br> water to the tree...<br> it will grow.<br> Water to the tree, it will grow.<br> Yes, it will grow. The tree will grow.<br> It has very big roots. The roots go...<br> deep into the earth.<br> Earth.<br> And all of it together...<br> is land.<br> Land.<br> Good. Earth.<br> Eggs.<br> Four of them. Four.<br> No. One, two, three, four.<br> Four.<br> You're right. You're learning very fast.<br> Pretty soon you and I will be able to talk.<br> Talk. Right.<br> What're you trying to do, McCormick,<br> shake the clapper out of the bell?<br> -Where's my flour, Mac?<br> -Ain't it ready?<br> I can't see it.<br> The Dummy should be here to serve you.<br> She ain't done it.<br> I put it down for her.<br> You'll have to come back tomorrow.<br> Where can I get a team weekdays?<br> I'll have to wait till Saturday.<br> But if it ain't done then,<br> I'm going somewheres else.<br> It'll be ready. I'll make her remember.<br> How can you expect a dimwit<br> to use her head?<br> What's all this? What is it?<br> Water, ocean.<br> Ocean.<br> What's got into you?<br> I write it all down for you.<br> Here, it's as plain as the nose on your face.<br> Oh. Well, I guess I forgot.<br> Look.<br> Well, I was wondering.<br> She never makes a mistake.<br> Did you ever think<br> of sending her to school?<br> School?<br> She's deaf and dumb, man.<br> There's no teaching her nothing.<br> Here's the extent of her learning.<br> I make a sign at the top of each page.<br> A cross for Pacquet,<br> a circle for McCormick...<br> two lines for the McQuiggens and so on.<br> A mark for each bag.<br> I put them down when they come in,<br> she strikes them off when they're ready.<br> She's learned to identify every man<br> by his mark.<br> Must be over 40 names in this book<br> and she knows every one of them.<br> So that shows, Mr. MacDonald,<br> that your daughter is an intelligent girl.<br> Now, there's a special school<br> for the deaf at McGill.<br> Schools cost money...<br> and money don't grow on trees<br> in this country.<br> We're lucky to keep body<br> and soul together, we farmers.<br> I couldn't spare her. Thanks.<br> There's work enough around here as it is.<br> But she could be taught, I'm sure of it.<br> What's her name?<br> Me wife wanted her named after herself...<br> Belinda. Belinda MacDonald.<br> But they call her the Dummy around here.<br> They shouldn't.<br> Even though she can't hear,<br> these people have very keen perceptions.<br> -Aye.<br> -They notice things.<br> Come to think of it, she's fond of colors.<br> I took her to church once years ago.<br> They played the organ.<br> A look come over her face<br> as though she heard.<br> I knew all the time<br> she couldn't hear a thing.<br> Well, I'm losing time.<br> I must get on with my work.<br> Good day to you.<br> Would you mind if I talked to her<br> once in a while?<br> Talk?<br> When I was an intern at the hospital<br> I worked for a while with deaf children.<br> Why, I might even have one of the books<br> still kicking around somewhere.<br> I'd like to try<br> to teach her some lip-reading.<br> You'll be wasting your while, man.<br> But you're welcome here anytime.<br> -$1.80, Mrs. Lutz.<br> -Did you get the oilcloth?<br> No, but I will save it for you<br> when it comes in. Thank you.<br> Bye.<br> There's the doctor again.<br> Talking to himself.<br> -It's spooky.<br> -I think he's queer in the head.<br> Pretty smart<br> when it comes to making out his bills.<br> Hello. Happen to know what kind<br> of tobacco Black MacDonald uses?<br> MacDonald has not bought here in weeks.<br> Dr. Richardson, I receive your bill.<br> Rather steep for a stomachache, yes?<br> As far as I remember, it was three calls.<br> Two of them after midnight.<br> Dr. Peterson always took his fees out<br> in barter, like everyone else.<br> Mr. Pacquet,<br> I have to get cash somewhere.<br> You and a few others<br> are the only ones who can afford it.<br> You wouldn't have to pay me any bills<br> if you'd stick to that diet I gave you.<br> The only trouble with you is<br> you eat too well.<br> Now, I'll have this. See, 15, isn't it?<br> Or would you rather wait<br> and have me take out a splinter?<br> Get your filthy bug out of my dough.<br> The spuds is covered with them.<br> I can't pick everyone off single-handed.<br> And milk, and plow,<br> and blast stones without any help.<br> -Don't blame me.<br> -I'm not blaming you, I'm only telling you.<br> I suppose you want me to pull the plow.<br> I suppose I'm not doing my share, cooking,<br> and mending, and baking, and spinning.<br> -Who helps me?<br> -You got the Dummy.<br> A fine lot of help, that one.<br> All the grand ideas that doctor<br> has been putting into her head.<br> Filling her up with fancy notions.<br> You know what she was doing<br> instead of feeding the hogs?<br> Brushing her hair.<br> That's not fair to me.<br> I'm doing the work of six.<br> What's this I hear about you<br> loafing all day? There's work to do.<br> Aggie, did you see that?<br> She knew what I was saying.<br> Oh, tosh.<br> She can hear. Belinda, come here!<br> -I tell you she understands, woman.<br> -You're wandering in your head.<br> -But she came when I called her.<br> -She was reading your lips.<br> She's been a very good pupil.<br> Belinda, how do you say hello to a friend?<br> That's right.<br> ''I am happy to see you.''<br> And I'm happy to see you.<br> -Telling me she can talk that way?<br> -Of course.<br> We've been studying<br> from a book of signs...<br> which were devised by a Frenchman<br> a couple of hundred years ago...<br> the Abbe de I'Epee, he was a priest.<br> See, each word has its own sign.<br> For instance, there's ''man.''<br> The sign is this: touching the hat brim.<br> -And what would ''woman'' be?<br> -This. Comes from a bonnet string.<br> And that's ''mother.''<br> Baby. You see, woman with a child.<br> It's beyond believing. It's as clear as day.<br> And that is the sign for ''day.''<br> You see, this represents the horizon and<br> this is the sun coming up over the horizon.<br> This is noon<br> with the sun directly overhead.<br> Afternoon, evening, and night<br> when the sun has disappeared completely.<br> Good morning.<br> Good night.<br> And that's ''bread.''<br> What is it? It's a butterfly. Sure.<br> It is a butterfly. It flutters.<br> Aggie!<br> Aggie, come here.<br> -I got something.<br> -What?<br> Look sharp now. Think fast.<br> What does this mean?<br> -It means you've gone loony.<br> -It's a butterfly. Look.<br> Don't go waving your hands at me,<br> I'm not the Dummy.<br> And if you want to have any bread to eat<br> while I'm gone, leave me be.<br> It's a good job you're going.<br> We'll have peace around here<br> for a couple of days.<br> It's like a miracle.<br> -Would she be saying ''father''?<br> -Yes, she did.<br> It's the first time she ever called me that.<br> Daughter, my daughter.<br> What do they want?<br> What's going on here, McCormick?<br> Where's my flour?<br> McQuiggens want theirs, too.<br> It's all done.<br> We'd better load it<br> before we get too dizzy from dancing.<br> It's there on the racks. Load it and get out.<br> Here it is, boys. Get to it!<br> All these are mine.<br> Put them on the bottom.<br> Yes, Lock.<br> -Afraid you'll crack a fingernail?<br> -Flour don't go good on my suit.<br> This floor's slick as a whistle.<br> Hey, Hector, come on. Give us a tune.<br> Hi, Stella, you're looking very handsome.<br> You like to dance.<br> Why don't you come with us?<br> -Yes.<br> -It'll be fun. Basket supper.<br> I'd love to. Unfortunately,<br> I have a previous engagement.<br> Two measles cases five miles apart.<br> Hey, the Dummy's dancing.<br> -Her name's Belinda.<br> -She looks kind of cute fixed up that way.<br> You keep away from that Dummy.<br> Keep away.... The Dummy and me?<br> I saw you taking in her legs.<br> Jealous of a dimwit.<br> I'm plum ashamed of you, woman!<br> One thing, she'd never tell on you.<br> -But keep away from her or I'll be able--<br> -Well, I guess that's all.<br> What are we waiting for?<br> I want some cider. Come on, hurry up.<br> Locky!<br> -What's the damage, Mac?<br> -You know what it is.<br> Locky, come on.<br> Everybody, sing. Everybody, sing now.<br> Didn't have time to finish them.<br> I can't do 10 things at once.<br> It's not my fault if my sister got sick.<br> Well, I'll only be gone a few days.<br> You can manage.<br> -Aggie!<br> -I'm coming.<br> Well, goodbye, Belinda.<br> Sometimes a body'd almost think<br> you understood.<br> You'll miss the train.<br> Besides, I don't want to leave Belinda<br> alone too long.<br> Nobody would bother stealing her.<br> There's Mrs. Johnny John-John<br> just back from hospital.<br> She looks right spry for a woman<br> who's just had her arteries cut out.<br> Not her arteries, Mrs. Lutz.<br> Get off my feet. You're drunk.<br> Mrs. Moore is her own worst enemy.<br> Not while I'm alive, she isn't.<br> Hello, Dummy.<br> Look what I brought you.<br> Want to dance?<br> First time a man kissed you, wasn't it?<br> Don't be scared, Dummy.<br> Your heart's pounding.<br> I caught a sea gull once,<br> it had the same scared look.<br> Hello, Mac.<br> Glad you're here. You've been missed.<br> Well, I'm sorry. I was busy with my call.<br> I've been worried about the girl.<br> There's something wrong.<br> -Why?<br> -You can see for yourself.<br> All right.<br> Hello, Aggie. You get back all right?<br> Wouldn't be here if I hadn't, would I?<br> -Is your sister better?<br> -Yes.<br> -Did she have a good doctor?<br> -Didn't have any. Doesn't believe in them.<br> Well, that's the right attitude<br> as long as one can afford it.<br> How's Belinda?<br> Getting peevisher by the day.<br> -Where is she?<br> -Around here somewhere.<br> Belinda. How are you?<br> Are you cross with me<br> for not coming to see you?<br> Well, you see, I couldn't.<br> Many men and women<br> suddenly decided to be sick...<br> at the same time.<br> Would you like to study your lesson now?<br> All right, no lesson.<br> Belinda, if you could only hear me.<br> You think I don't know what it means<br> being lonely like you are?<br> I've been lonely myself,<br> even when I was a child.<br> Already then I wanted to be a doctor.<br> I thought that helping others<br> might help me. It did somehow.<br> Then all those other things happened.<br> The war and all that came after.<br> Made me lose faith in everything.<br> In myself, too.<br> Belinda.<br> Belinda, you must help me.<br> I need you.<br> Yes. I need you.<br> If you only knew what it meant<br> seeing you smile for the first time.<br> Bringing happiness, if it's only<br> to one single human being, is....<br> Belinda, don't let me think<br> I've failed again.<br> You'll help me.<br> Mac. Mac, come here.<br> Mac, Belinda's great trouble<br> is nothing more than loneliness.<br> And she's got to have a chance.<br> Now, there's a doctor in Stepney,<br> I met him at McGill.<br> A brilliant diagnostician.<br> I don't know exactly what good<br> it would do...<br> but I'd like to take Belinda to him.<br> Belinda...<br> how would you like to go with me<br> to see a town?<br> T-O-W-N.<br> A big town.<br> You've done such wonders<br> with her yourself.<br> Why does she have to go see that fellow?<br> Because, Mac, I don't know enough<br> and I think he does.<br> Doctor like that costs money.<br> Don't worry about that. I'm going to write<br> and ask him for an interview.<br> I'm sure he'll do it.<br> I'm going to write him tonight.<br> No, Belinda, not women. Men.<br> Do you see any hope, Doctor?<br> Aye, that's why we keep on practicing,<br> Robert.<br> I understand your concern,<br> but she needn't worry.<br> The one fact I'm sure of<br> is there's no otosclerosis...<br> so as you know, it can't be hereditary.<br> There's no possibility the expected child<br> could inherit it.<br> Clinically, the birth of the child<br> could make all the difference...<br> if my theory is correct.<br> I cannot say for certain, nobody can.<br> But what you've accomplished<br> is remarkable.<br> I'd hardly say that.<br> I just tried a few things I knew.<br> You've always been an idealist<br> from way back.<br> Yeah, that's what makes good doctors,<br> Robert.<br> Keep in communication with me.<br> I'll be interested in following<br> the case with you.<br> -I'd be very grateful.<br> -Goodbye, lad.<br> Dr. Gray said it wasn't possible<br> to determine her condition...<br> after only one examination.<br> He said she was very healthy,<br> very intelligent.<br> And that he wanted to see her again.<br> Fine. Now maybe she'll have a chance.<br> She's worn out.<br> She slept nearly the whole way home.<br> Belinda, why don't you go upstairs to bed?<br> Good night, daughter.<br> She looks so grand in that dress.<br> Beats me why I never noticed it before.<br> Do you think I could take her to church<br> come Sunday?<br> She's only been there the once,<br> when she was a child.<br> Of course, why not?<br> Right now, how about taking the cows<br> to the barn?<br> I'm forgetting everything.<br> You're not very fond of Belinda, are you?<br> I've always been civil to her.<br> She's my brother's daughter.<br> You should see to it that she doesn't<br> have to carry those heavy sacks.<br> She's not too strong.<br> Doctor, you'll be doing<br> my brother and me a favor...<br> if you'll stop putting<br> those grand ideas into her head.<br> There were no complaints until you came.<br> She did her work like the rest of us...<br> like we all have to do if we want<br> to keep a roof over our heads.<br> I have to tell you, Aggie,<br> you're the only woman she knows...<br> and she'll be in need<br> of your sympathy and help.<br> -My help?<br> -Belinda's going to have a child.<br> Oh, no. No, it's not true.<br> There isn't any doubt.<br> When her father finds out, he'll kill her.<br> That's why I told you.<br> She doesn't know.<br> Doesn't even realize it herself yet.<br> -But he must find out.<br> -I'll tell him, at the right moment.<br> Oh, it's....<br> Do you have any idea who the man was?<br> No.<br> Don't let anything happen to her.<br> I've been pretty brusque with her.<br> You're making up for it now.<br> We MacDonalds, we're high-tempered.<br> We fight amongst ourselves...<br> but let trouble come from outside...<br> and we'll stick together.<br> We will open our services by singing<br> the first verse of hymn number 73.<br> I'm requested to publish<br> the banns of marriage...<br> between Laughlin McCormick<br> of Carcadie...<br> and Stella Maguire, spinster of this parish.<br> If any of you know<br> cause or just impediment...<br> why these two persons should not<br> be joined together in holy matrimony...<br> ye are to declare it.<br> This is the first time of asking.<br> We will close our services<br> by singing hymn number 43.<br> You're the lucky one. Congratulations!<br> Mr. MacDonald, I'm so happy<br> to see you at our church again...<br> and Miss MacDonald.<br> I didn't know I could be so proud<br> of my own flesh and blood.<br> Did you see the way<br> they all turned and looked at her?<br> Well, Stella, this is quite a surprise.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, good luck to you.<br> When's the wedding?<br> You mustn't forget your chores, girl.<br> Have you lost your mind,<br> Black MacDonald?<br> What's the matter now?<br> She's no mule! She can't stand all that.<br> What's got into you, woman?<br> I have to have this mash mixed, haven't I?<br> She's done it ever since we had pigs.<br> Well, she won't do it anymore.<br> Now you leave her to me.<br> Sit down.<br> You're as white as a sheet.<br> I'll get you some water.<br> -Here.<br> -What's wrong with her?<br> She's out of sorts.<br> The doctor told her to take it easy.<br> Look, I work from 4:00 in the morning<br> till dark. Year in, year out.<br> What she has to do is no hardship.<br> Belinda's a healthy girl.<br> She's not.<br> Now you leave her to me<br> and to the doctor.<br> What do you make a mystery of it for?<br> She's my daughter.<br> I've a right to know<br> if there's anything serious.<br> Belinda's gonna have a.... A child.<br> Oh, no.<br> -It couldn't be.<br> -It's true.<br> That dirty, filthy doctor!<br> No! No, you're wrong.<br> Who would it be then?<br> I don't know.<br> -Tell me his name.<br> -Hold your temper.<br> Hold my temper?<br> What kind of a father do you think I am?<br> Listen, child, who was it that hurt you?<br> How do you expect her to tell you?<br> She doesn't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> Keep out of this.<br> Show me. Show me the man's name.<br> Who was it? Who was it that hurt you?<br> She doesn't know! Leave her be.<br> Don't be a fool, woman.<br> She's no babe in arms for all she's deaf.<br> She's trying to shield the man.<br> Listen, child, show me.<br> Show me, I tell you.<br> Do I have to beat it out of you?<br> Oh, no. No, don't!<br> Stop it!<br> You don't know what you're doing!<br> -Let go of me! I got to find the man!<br> -Come to your senses!<br> Even if she could talk,<br> she couldn't tell you.<br> You've no right to go on this way.<br> -No right? I'm her father.<br> -Then act like a father!<br> Leave her be. I couldn't help it.<br> You're the one person that can give her<br> what she needs most:<br> help, comfort, and understanding.<br> What are you trying to do,<br> drive her insane?<br> -I couldn't help it. Hard to go on....<br> -Aggie, come on. Take her to her room.<br> -Have her get some rest.<br> -Yes.<br> Now, Mac, you've got to listen to me.<br> I understand how you feel<br> and I don't blame you...<br> but believe me,<br> it's blotted out of her mind.<br> The way you forget a nightmare...<br> because you don't wanna bring back<br> that terrible fear.<br> I've seen it in the war.<br> It's nature throwing up a barrier<br> to prevent something worse.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> -I've got to find the man.<br> -What good will that do her?<br> I'll lay what he done<br> before the men of the village.<br> We'll show him what justice is.<br> And even if you do,<br> how will that help the girl?<br> Dragging her into a mess of scandal...<br> when she doesn't even know<br> what it's all about.<br> -It'll crucify her. Is that what you want?<br> -You know it isn't.<br> What am I going to do? The shame of it.<br> Mac, you've got to think of her now,<br> not of yourself and your pride.<br> There's only one shame,<br> failing a human being who needs you.<br> I'm going up and talk to her now.<br> He didn't mean to hurt you.<br> He's just.... Just very worried.<br> That's what makes him<br> seem harsh and unjust sometimes.<br> He works so hard.<br> That's why he hasn't been able<br> to give you more time.<br> You've been alone so much, Belinda...<br> but you're not going to be alone anymore.<br> You're going to be a mother.<br> Yes, Belinda.<br> You'll call it Johnny? But Belinda, you....<br> Well...<br> if you want it so much,<br> I guess you'll have a boy.<br> I'm sorry I couldn't get here any faster.<br> The horse could hardly break<br> through the drifts.<br> I was that worried.<br> Now, Aggie, I want you to get me<br> some more hot water, lots of it.<br> And woolen blankets. All you can find.<br> Why does it take so long? It's hours.<br> It's hard to get born and it's hard to die.<br> Do you have some brandy around?<br> I guess there's some.<br> -Aggie, now hold that just like that.<br> -Yes.<br> -On the corners.<br> -Her not making a sound, it's uncanny.<br> Here, try to drink this.<br> Got to keep that heart going.<br> What are you bawling about?<br> -How is she?<br> -She's all right.<br> The baby's here.<br> It's a boy.<br> Belinda, here's your boy.<br> Can he talk?<br> He certainly can.<br> That ain't dirt, that's good clean earth.<br> That won't hurt Johnny none.<br> I was brought up in a hog wallow.<br> You can't say I'm peaked.<br> What's eating you now?<br> You don't get something for nothing<br> in this world.<br> -What's that mean?<br> -It means no more credit.<br> We've had bad years before,<br> he's never stopped our credit.<br> Why didn't you try to reason with him?<br> Because nobody would listen to me.<br> I don't dare show my face in the village.<br> Everybody treating us like lepers.<br> Come, Aggie.<br> It's not like a MacDonald to give up...<br> because we're having a little hard time.<br> -We'll manage.<br> -Manage, is it?<br> And who's to manage the salt,<br> and the sugar, and the tea, and the like?<br> Where are they to come from?<br> We've managed to get deeper in debt<br> than anyone in Christendom.<br> We've managed to shut our eyes<br> to everything that's happening.<br> I don't even remember what<br> the grinding wheel sounds like anymore.<br> Try managing that!<br> He won't trust us for one more cent,<br> Pacquet won't, until that bill's paid.<br> Them sheets are white as snow.<br> I bleached them extra special.<br> The prettiest bride this town's ever seen,<br> that's what you'll be.<br> -And who told you about it first?<br> -You did.<br> The cards never lie. There he is.<br> There'll be many a broken heart<br> come this Friday night.<br> Hello, Stella. I can drop you off.<br> No, thanks.<br> Wait a minute. What's the matter?<br> Did Mrs. Poggety tell you to keep away<br> from men with blue eyes?<br> A grown-up girl about to be married<br> swallowing that hocus--<br> Can't you mind your own affairs?<br> Always being so superior.<br> Always finding fault with everybody.<br> You of all people, after what you've done.<br> -What have I done?<br> -You know well enough.<br> A girl who can't defend herself,<br> who can't even talk. Shaming her.<br> What do you mean?<br> Who said it? Locky?<br> Everybody says it.<br> The whole village is talking about it.<br> That's why nobody calls you.<br> So Locky said it.<br> I wouldn't have thought<br> you'd believe that, Stella.<br> Fog's rolling in.<br> Can hear the lighthouse<br> sounding off already.<br> Won't help the crops any.<br> The poorer the crops,<br> the peskier the crows.<br> Mac.<br> They're saying in the village<br> that I'm Johnny's father.<br> It's believable.<br> When they don't know the answer,<br> they make up one.<br> I've been around this place a lot.<br> At all hours.<br> I've been thinking about this<br> for a long time.<br> I've even thought of your leaving here,<br> but that wouldn't prove anything...<br> giving up something<br> you've worked for all your life.<br> I know of only one solution.<br> For me to marry Belinda.<br> That would really give them<br> something to talk about.<br> And pretty soon<br> the gossip would die down for good.<br> You're being generous, but it won't do.<br> You see, she kind of feels things,<br> and people, with her insides.<br> You don't love her,<br> you only feel a kind of pity for her.<br> You'd hurt her worse<br> than if you hated her.<br> Make me feel pretty cheap.<br> For a while there I guess I was thinking<br> I was quite a guy.<br> You're one of the best I've run across.<br> Sometimes you can be too good.<br> Harm others while doing it.<br> Well, look who's here.<br> I have something for Johnny.<br> You can see him. Watch.<br> Yes, you can see him hear.<br> -Coming up a blow.<br> -A storm?<br> Coming straight in.<br> I better get the cattle in.<br> I'll stay here. He has it.<br> Mac?<br> Mac!<br> Well.<br> You don't know me, huh?<br> You ought to, though.<br> What are you doing in here?<br> I just come by<br> to see about some ground barley.<br> That's a cute lad. Never seen him before.<br> Keep away from him.<br> What's the matter?<br> No harm in looking at him, is there?<br> -Don't be scared. I'm Locky.<br> -Take your hands off him.<br> All right, all right. He's a big boy, isn't he?<br> Spitting image of his father.<br> Well, all right, if you don't want business,<br> I can go somewheres else.<br> -Where you going?<br> -With you.<br> -Well, where to?<br> -Wherever you're going.<br> -Why?<br> -To tell them.<br> -To tell them what?<br> -What you done.<br> -So they'll know how low a man can get.<br> -You'll tell them nothing.<br> Go ahead, walk.<br> Something's wrong?<br> What's happened?<br> Belinda, what's the matter?<br> Belinda, what is it? What's bothering you?<br> Belinda.<br> ''Our Father, which art in heaven...<br> ''hallowed be thy name.<br> ''Thy kingdom come.<br> ''Thy will be done...<br> ''in earth, as it is in heaven.<br> ''Give us this day our daily bread.<br> ''Forgive us our debts...<br> ''as we forgive our debtors.<br> ''Lead us not into temptation.<br> ''Deliver us from evil.<br> ''For thine is the kingdom...<br> ''and the power...<br> ''and the glory...<br> ''for ever and ever.<br> ''Amen.''<br> He's trying to sell him<br> his horse and buggy, he is.<br> He stopped talking when I came in,<br> but I heard enough.<br> But what will he do without them?<br> A doctor.<br> What practice he has he can cover afoot.<br> Just to the mill and back.<br> His luck's run out, that's what.<br> I saw it in the cards, so help me.<br> Black. Spades, spades, spades,<br> no matter where I put them.<br> That rig is worth<br> two times more than this bill.<br> I make business and I have the right...<br> to get back what is owed me<br> all fair and honorable.<br> But I do not want people saying<br> that I take advantage.<br> You don't understand.<br> You'd be doing me a favor.<br> I have to get rid of them.<br> You mean, something is wrong?<br> The horse is lame, maybe, yes?<br> No, he's sturdy as a horse.<br> But I'm in a hurry,<br> so I have to take what I can get.<br> -I'm leaving here for good.<br> -You are? When?<br> You seem pleased about it.<br> -No, I think it's better for you.<br> -Why?<br> You see, in this village,<br> we do not appreciate people coming here.<br> Strangers who do not follow<br> our ways of living.<br> There are men here who can be very angry<br> and something can happen.<br> -What?<br> -Anything.<br> Look, Pacquet,<br> put away the tar and feathers.<br> Do you want the rig or don't you?<br> She's as pretty as a picture.<br> Good luck, my boy. Now you can pay me.<br> You know I can. And I want that boat back.<br> You will have it.<br> -You've a good man, Stella.<br> -Thank you, Pacquet.<br> Charlotte, catch!<br> -Bye!<br> -Bye!<br> It's about time Locky settled down.<br> He's led a stormy youth.<br> Out on the ocean, you mean, Mrs. McKee.<br> You know what I mean.<br> Belinda, I want you<br> to promise me something.<br> If anything ever happens to Johnny...<br> I want you to send for Dr. Gray.<br> I couldn't come, Belinda. I won't be here.<br> I have to go away.<br> After all, I'm a doctor.<br> I can't help anyone this way.<br> I can't even make a living for myself.<br> Anyway, it's the only thing to do.<br> So I made an application.<br> I made an application.<br> A staff job at the Toronto Hospital,<br> and they've taken me on.<br> I got the answer today.<br> Do you understand?<br> Do you understand, Belinda?<br> In a month or two...<br> I'll be able to take care of things,<br> help you out.<br> I've talked it over with Aggie.<br> You see, the trouble is<br> I have to leave very soon.<br> Tomorrow, in fact.<br> No, Belinda. I won't be able to come.<br> I'm going across the Gulf.<br> Yes, very far away.<br> Yes, I'll be careful.<br> Belinda....<br> Forgive me, I didn't know.<br> Don't be sorry.<br> I'm very glad.<br> Come on.<br> Hurry up, we're late.<br> It is the honor of the community<br> we have to think of.<br> Respectable people do not stand by...<br> and see shameful things like this happen,<br> and do nothing.<br> As a member of the Town Council,<br> I say it is our duty...<br> to correct this unfortunate situation.<br> And we do not want anyone<br> to come from outside...<br> and meddle in this.<br> We want to do this quietly.<br> We can take care of it ourselves.<br> Yes, Mrs. Moore?<br> Isn't it cruel to take a baby away<br> from its mother?<br> A creature who's a disgrace<br> to the whole village?<br> Who can't even teach a child his prayers?<br> Is it a crime to save a baby<br> from a life of misery?<br> These women can't provide for a child.<br> Already they've sold most of their cattle.<br> The place is run down.<br> There's no man to work it.<br> Why, the baby will be like her,<br> running loose like an animal.<br> The doctor. When he finds out,<br> couldn't he make trouble?<br> After what he did?<br> Sneaking out of town<br> in the middle of the night?<br> He will be too smart<br> to ever show his face here again.<br> I could almost feel sorry for her.<br> It's a good thing she can't think or feel.<br> Nothing better could happen for the child<br> than the offer we got.<br> He will have a name,<br> a home with respected parents...<br> Mr. and Mrs. McCormick.<br> Now, there's no need for a lot of red tape.<br> All we have to do is<br> get the release from the girl.<br> She only has to sign it.<br> It is an easy thing to make a cross.<br> With the release we send this petition.<br> I do not think there will be any trouble.<br> If the girl had normal intelligence<br> she would be grateful.<br> What are you stopping for?<br> Let's end this bickering.<br> He has the makings of a fine, sturdy lad.<br> I'm telling you again,<br> I'd sooner not take him...<br> than let you turn him<br> into a thickheaded farmer.<br> And I tell you he'll have to earn his keep<br> when he's growed.<br> What if he gets sick? It'll cost money.<br> Whose money?<br> I don't recall you bringing in any.<br> Well, it's ours, ain't it? You're my wife.<br> And you expect me to pay for the honor?<br> You needn't worry.<br> I'm not fooling myself<br> about why you married me.<br> And I know what started you on the idea.<br> You want the kid because of that doctor.<br> 'Cause you think it's his.<br> You're sweet on him<br> and couldn't hogtie him for yourself.<br> I loathe him.<br> A man that would do a thing like that.<br> All right,<br> then don't think to pamper the boy.<br> He'll work as soon as he's able.<br> Giddap there. Giddap.<br> I'll go by myself. Give me the letter.<br> What for?<br> She won't understand it anyhow.<br> Give me that letter.<br> Can't hear, can't read.<br> And don't be all day about it.<br> My coat?<br> May I see the baby?<br> May I hold him?<br> May I hold him?<br> Belinda.<br> Would you let me take care of him?<br> I mean, take him home just for a while.<br> He'd be very happy,<br> he'd have everything he wants.<br> You could see him whenever you like.<br> Please let me, just for a little while.<br> You have all this work.<br> Why not, Belinda? I only want to help you,<br> can't you understand?<br> Just sign here. Just make a cross.<br> If you don't give him to me,<br> they'll come and take him.<br> Belinda, listen, please! Let me take him.<br> I won't....<br> -What's happened?<br> -Locky, I can't do it.<br> What are you talking about?<br> He's ours, been given to us,<br> all legal and proper.<br> We must give him up.<br> We're being mean, Locky,<br> mean to the Dummy.<br> You think she had no feeling,<br> you should see her with the baby.<br> We just can't take him, she's his mother.<br> His mother.<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> I'm his father.<br> What?<br> His father, I'm telling you!<br> He's as much mine as hers.<br> Locky, I told you to keep away from her.<br> It's all over and in the past.<br> Unfortunate it is, it happened.<br> A man wants children and I want him.<br> Something in here wants him.<br> By the Godfrey, I'll have him !<br> Where's the kid?<br> Get out of the way.<br> It is the duty of the Crown Prosecutor...<br> to present the facts<br> which will prove to you...<br> that beyond a doubt,<br> Belinda MacDonald is guilty of murder.<br> This is a difficult case...<br> due to the unfortunate circumstances<br> of the accused.<br> But you and I, gentlemen,<br> must not allow these circumstances...<br> to bring about an undue amount<br> of sympathy for the accused.<br> A murder has been committed<br> and the full penalty must be paid.<br> Is there any reason you know of,<br> Mrs. McCormick...<br> why she should have killed your husband?<br> No.<br> -Your witness.<br> -No questions.<br> Miss MacDonald.<br> When the McCormicks...<br> arrived that afternoon...<br> is it true that you were<br> in the house alone?<br> Does she understand?<br> Well, what did she answer?<br> She's not answering my question.<br> She hasn't answered any of my questions.<br> All she says is,<br> ''I want my baby, I want my baby.''<br> There, ''Tell them<br> to give me my baby, please.''<br> The defendant obviously<br> doesn't want to answer the question.<br> My Lord...<br> under the circumstances,<br> the defendant is naturally confused.<br> Apparently she does not understand<br> the interpreter.<br> Since she was trained in the sign language<br> by one of the witnesses...<br> Dr. Richardson...<br> would it be permissible<br> for him to translate for her?<br> -Permission granted.<br> -Dr. Robert Richardson.<br> Would you mind facing her directly<br> so that she can read your lips?<br> Were you alone in the house...<br> when the McCormicks came to see you?<br> Did you understand?<br> ''I was with my baby.''<br> After you attacked Mrs. McCormick<br> and she ran out--<br> I object, My Lord.<br> The defendant has not admitted<br> attacking Mrs. McCormick.<br> Objection sustained.<br> I'll phrase the question differently.<br> After Mrs. McCormick left,<br> what did you do?<br> Isn't it true that as soon as she left<br> you went to get the gun?<br> ''I was very much afraid.''<br> So you did take the gun deliberately?<br> Objection!<br> The defendant has made<br> no such admission.<br> My Lord--<br> If the Prosecution will be patient,<br> I might be able to help.<br> Please try to understand<br> what it means to be as she is...<br> living in a world apart,<br> shut off from everyone...<br> never hearing the warmth<br> of a human voice.<br> Think of the loneliness and the fear.<br> These people, although tutored,<br> are governed almost solely by intuition.<br> Belinda's been instructed<br> in certain fundamentals.<br> -She knows right from wrong...<br> -My Lord--<br> ...but something in her was stronger than<br> the precept, ''Thou shalt not kill.''<br> My Lord, I object.<br> Dr. Richardson is completely out of order.<br> He's not the counsel for the accused.<br> Your Lordship, I insist this girl obeyed<br> an impulse older than the laws of man:<br> The instinct of a mother<br> to protect her child.<br> Any further breach of your capacity<br> as interpreter...<br> I shall hold as in contempt of this court.<br> Objection sustained.<br> Now please proceed.<br> When did you get the gun?<br> After Locky McCormick came in?<br> ''Yes.'' Why?<br> ''I was afraid he would hurt my baby.''<br> And that was your only motive?<br> Was there any other reason<br> why you were afraid of him?<br> Your Lordship! The interpreter,<br> in rephrasing my question...<br> is trying to coach the defendant.<br> This man is totally unqualified.<br> He's deeply involved in the case himself<br> and I can prove it.<br> May I present new evidence?<br> -Has it any bearing on this testimony?<br> -It has.<br> Permission granted.<br> Dr. Richardson, in your earlier testimony...<br> didn't you deny being the father<br> of Belinda MacDonald's child?<br> -I did.<br> -Did you write this?<br> I did.<br> I should like to read a passage<br> from this letter.<br> ''...physician takes a lot more time....<br> ''Work is hard. Be here soon.<br> ''I have found a house for us.<br> ''It is small but it has<br> a beautifully sunny room...<br> ''for our little son.''<br> I challenge this man's integrity<br> as a witness and as an individual.<br> His actions speak for themselves.<br> Betraying this girl, ignobly fleeing scandal.<br> He's laid himself open<br> to a charge of perjury.<br> His very appearance here is an affront<br> to the dignity of this court.<br> He has violated the ethics<br> of an honorable profession.<br> He should be stricken<br> from the medical register...<br> expelled from decent society.<br> No! No!<br> It was Locky's fault!<br> It was him, Locky. He's the baby's father.<br> It was his fault!<br> He told me<br> the day we went to get the baby.<br> I wanted the baby but...<br> somehow when I saw her with him<br> I couldn't.<br> I said, ''We shouldn't, it's mean,<br> she's his mother.''<br> And he said.... He said:<br> ''I'm his father.''<br> In this court's opinion,<br> the evidence is incontrovertible.<br> That she acted in defense of her home...<br> against a man<br> whose guilt has been proven.<br> The court expresses the hope<br> that the jury's verdict...<br> will stand as a reminder<br> that justice in this Dominion...<br> will always protect the private citizen...<br> against those who would interfere<br> with his rights...<br> and his dignity as a human being.<br> I'm glad that it turned out the way it did.<br> I know, Belinda.<br> You don't have to say anything.<br> English<br>
