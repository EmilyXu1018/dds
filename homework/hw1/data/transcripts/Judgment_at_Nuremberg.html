                        I didn't know it was so bad.<br> A couple of incendiaries, these old<br> buildings go up like Cellophane.<br> A wall separates the old section<br> of Nuremberg from the new.<br> It goes back to... How far<br> does it go back, Schmidt?<br> - 1219, sir.<br> - 1219.<br> This is where the Nazi party<br> held their rallies, isn't it?<br> They all came here. Hitler,<br> Goebbels, the whole crew.<br> Thousands of them,<br> from all over Germany.<br> Does he have to blow<br> that damn horn so much?<br> It's not necessary to blow<br> the horn so much, Schmidt.<br> - You both know your duties?<br> - Ja.<br> Well, here we are.<br> A little bit of old Germany.<br> - Senator Burkette.<br> - Captain Byers, this is Judge Haywood.<br> - Byers here will be your aide.<br> - My what?<br> Clerk, general guide, liaison.<br> Any capacity you wish to use me.<br> This will be your staff,<br> Mr and Mrs Halbestadt.<br> - Hello.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Good afternoon, Your Honour.<br> - Welcome.<br> - You've met your driver, Schmidt.<br> I'm at your service any time<br> you need me. Day or night.<br> Thanks.<br> Let's show him around the<br> rest of the place. Dan.<br> We're in the reception room.<br> Living room. The study is in there.<br> There are two bedrooms on<br> this floor, three upstairs.<br> The furniture is part<br> antique, part US army.<br> The piano is showing signs of wear and<br> tear, but it's a genuine Bechstein.<br> - Quite a view, isn't it, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> Uh...<br> Senator, I really, really<br> don't need all this.<br> When the US government does<br> something, it does it right.<br> - Who used to live here?<br> - An important Nazi general and his wife.<br> Is there anything else Judge<br> Haywood ought to know?<br> - Sir, any questions?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - You're West Point, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - What's your first name?<br> - Harrison. Harry.<br> Well, Harry, look. I'm not West Point, and<br> all this formality kind of gets me down.<br> It puts me ill at ease. You think it would<br> be too much of an infraction of the rules<br> if you were to call me<br> Judge or Dan or something?<br> OK, Judge. We do all our<br> shopping at the army commissary.<br> There isn't enough food at the local<br> markets. The driver knows where it is.<br> Here's a copy of the<br> indictment of the case.<br> - Thanks.<br> - I hope you'll be comfortable here, sir.<br> Captain, I think the whole state of<br> Maine would be comfortable here.<br> My office is next to yours,<br> if you need anything.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Senator.<br> Do you think I need the three servants?<br> It kind of makes me feel like a damn fool.<br> Well, it helps them out as well<br> as you. You see, here they eat.<br> Oh.<br> Well, I need three servants.<br> It's good to have a man of<br> your stature here, Dan.<br> Sure. Sure. I was the only man<br> in America qualified for this job.<br> You know I wasn't the first<br> choice, nor even the tenth.<br> - You know it, I know it.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Let's face it. Hitler is gone, Goebbels is<br> gone, Gring is gone... committed suicide.<br> Now we're down to judging the<br> doctors, businessmen and judges.<br> - Some think they shouldn't be judged.<br> - So?<br> It makes for a lack of<br> candidates for the job.<br> You had to beat the backwoods of<br> Maine to come up with a hick like me.<br> - I hope you're not sorry you came.<br> - No, I'm not sorry I came.<br> I just wanted you to know I<br> know where the body is buried.<br> No, I think the<br> trials should go on.<br> Especially the trials of the German<br> judges. I hope I'm up to it.<br> You're up to it.<br> Well, relax. Enjoy this<br> place while you can.<br> - You're gonna be a pretty busy fellow.<br> - Thanks, Senator.<br> See you tomorrow, Judge.<br> Shall we, uh, take these upstairs?<br> Oh, yes, thank you.<br> - Here, I can take that one.<br> - No, let me take it. Please.<br> Here they come.<br> The tribunal is now in session.<br> God bless the United States<br> and this honourable tribunal.<br> The tribunal will now<br> arraign the defendants.<br> A microphone will be placed in<br> front of the defendant Emil Hahn.<br> Emil Hahn, are you represented<br> by counsel before this tribunal?<br> Not guilty.<br> The question was are you<br> represented by counsel?<br> I am represented.<br> How do you plead to the charges and<br> specifications in the indictment,<br> guilty or not guilty?<br> Not guilty on all counts.<br> Friedrich Hofstetter.<br> Are you represented by counsel<br> before this tribunal?<br> - I am represented.<br> - How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?<br> Nicht schuldig.<br> You may be seated.<br> Werner Lampe.<br> Are you represented by counsel<br> before this tribunal?<br> Counsel?<br> Yes, yes, of course,<br> I am represented.<br> How do you plead to the<br> charges, guilty or not guilty?<br> Nicht schuldig.<br> You may be seated.<br> Ernst Janning.<br> Ernst Janning, are you represented<br> by counsel before this tribunal?<br> Ernst Janning, are you represented<br> by counsel before this tribunal?<br> I represent the<br> defendant, Your Honour.<br> How do you plead to the<br> charges and specifications<br> set forth in the indictment against<br> you, guilty or not guilty?<br> Your Honour, may<br> I address the court?<br> The defendant does not recognise<br> the authority of this tribunal<br> and wishes to lodge<br> a formal protest.<br> A plea of not guilty<br> will be entered.<br> The prosecution will begin<br> its opening address.<br> Slow and easy, Junior.<br> The case is unusual, in that the<br> defendants are charged with crimes<br> committed in the name of the law.<br> These men, together with their<br> deceased or fugitive colleagues,<br> are the embodiment of what passed<br> for justice during the Third Reich.<br> The defendants served as judges<br> during the period of the Third Reich.<br> Therefore you, Your Honours,<br> as judges on the bench,<br> will be sitting in judgment<br> of judges in the dock.<br> And this is as it should be.<br> For only a judge knows how much<br> more a court is than a courtroom.<br> It is a process and a spirit.<br> It is the house of law.<br> The defendants knew this too.<br> They knew courtrooms well.<br> They sat in their black robes and<br> they distorted, they perverted,<br> they destroyed justice<br> and law in Germany.<br> The prosecution will<br> please watch the light.<br> - The interpreter cannot follow you.<br> - I'm sorry, Your Honour.<br> They distorted, they perverted,<br> they destroyed justice<br> and law in Germany.<br> This in itself is<br> undoubtedly a great crime.<br> But the prosecution is not calling<br> the defendants to account<br> for violating constitutional guaranties<br> or withholding due process of law.<br> The prosecution is calling<br> them to account for murder,<br> brutalities,<br> torture,<br> atrocities!<br> They share, with all the<br> leaders of the Third Reich,<br> responsibility for the most<br> malignant, the most calculated,<br> the most devastating crimes in<br> the history of all mankind.<br> They are perhaps more guilty<br> than some of the others,<br> for they had attained maturity long<br> before Hitler's rise to power.<br> Their minds weren't warped at<br> an early age by Nazi teachings.<br> They embraced the ideologies of the<br> Third Reich as educated adults,<br> when they, most of all,<br> should have valued justice.<br> Here they'll receive the<br> justice they denied others.<br> They'll be judged according to the<br> evidence presented in this courtroom.<br> The prosecution asks nothing more.<br> Herr Rolfe will make the opening<br> statement for the defence.<br> May it please the tribunal.<br> It is not only a great honour...<br> but also a great challenge...<br> for an advocate...<br> to aid this tribunal in its task.<br> The entire civilised world<br> will follow closely<br> what we do here.<br> For this is not an ordinary trial,<br> by any means of the<br> accepted parochial sense.<br> The avowed purpose of this tribunal<br> is broader than the visiting<br> of retribution on a few men.<br> It is dedicated to the reconsecration<br> of the temple of justice.<br> It is dedicated to finding a code of justice<br> the whole world will be responsible to.<br> How will this code be established?<br> It will be established<br> in a clear, honest evaluation of<br> the responsibility for the crimes<br> in the indictment stated<br> by the prosecution.<br> In the words of the great American<br> jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes,<br> "This responsibility will not<br> be found only in documents<br> that no one contests or denies."<br> "it will be found in considerations<br> of a political or social nature."<br> "it will be found, most of<br> all, in the character of men."<br> What is the character<br> of Ernst Janning?<br> Let us examine his<br> life for a moment.<br> He was born in 1885.<br> Received the degree of<br> Doctor of Law in 1907.<br> Became a judge in<br> East Prussia in 1914.<br> Following World War I, he became<br> one of the Weimar Republic leaders<br> and one of the framers of its<br> democratic constitution.<br> In subsequent years, he<br> achieved international fame<br> not only for his work as a great jurist,<br> but also as the author of legal textbooks<br> which are still used in<br> universities all over the world.<br> He became Minister of<br> Justice in Germany in 1935.<br> If Ernst Janning is<br> to be found guilty,<br> certain implications must arise.<br> A judge does not make the laws.<br> He carries out the<br> laws of his country.<br> The statement "My<br> country, right or wrong"<br> was expressed by a great<br> American patriot.<br> It is no less true for<br> a German patriot.<br> Should Ernst Janning have carried<br> out the laws of his country?<br> Or should he have refused to carry<br> them out and become a traitor?<br> This is the crux of the issue<br> at the bottom of this trial.<br> The defence is as dedicated<br> to finding responsibility<br> as is the prosecution.<br> For it is not only Ernst<br> Janning who is on trial here.<br> It is the German people.<br> The tribunal will recess<br> until further notification.<br> Yeah.<br> If it's all right with you, Byers<br> can file these briefs later.<br> It was quite a damning speech<br> by Colonel Lawson, wasn't it?<br> I wonder if those men in the<br> dock can really be responsible<br> for the things he listed<br> in the indictment.<br> I've been here two years,<br> and after that long<br> you find that responsibility<br> is not a cut-and-dried thing.<br> What are you fellows<br> up to this weekend?<br> My wife and I are going to Lige.<br> There's nothing in Liege.<br> I've been there.<br> My son was in the 101 st.<br> He's buried in the American<br> cemetery outside Liege.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> - See you Monday, Dan.<br> - Mm.<br> - Coming my way?<br> - No, I'm staying here for a moment.<br> I'm waiting for some<br> records from Byers.<br> Right.<br> - Here are the reports you asked for, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Captain, do you think you could get me a<br> copy of the books Ernst Janning wrote?<br> - There are quite a few of them.<br> - I'd like all of them.<br> And also a copy of the Weimar<br> constitution. Can you get that for me?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Thank you.<br> - How long have you been here, Captain?<br> - Two years.<br> - Two years, that's a long time.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Any friends?<br> - Sure.<br> - German friends?<br> - Yes.<br> - A girl?<br> - Yes.<br> Her parents were Nazis, but she<br> was eight when they came in.<br> - I didn't ask you that.<br> - Maybe you were thinking it.<br> It's natural to think about it.<br> I thought if anybody was going to<br> indoctrinate her, it might as well be me.<br> - Will there be anything else?<br> - No. I think I'll take a walk around town.<br> Try the old section for<br> a beer and a sausage.<br> Thank you.<br> Nicht mehr! Nicht mehr!<br> Auf Wiedersehen, Opa.<br> - Do you understand English?<br> - Yes, a little.<br> - What did she say?<br> - She said "Goodbye, Grandpa."<br> Vor uns liegt Deutschland,<br> in uns marschiert Deutschland,<br> und hinter uns kommt Deutschland.<br> - Are they treating you all right?<br> - Yes. They are treating me all right.<br> We still have some friends who have<br> contact with the American authorities.<br> - I can tell them if they are not.<br> - They're treating me all right.<br> Doctor Janning...<br> we are both in an<br> embarrassing position.<br> I know you didn't want<br> me as your counsel.<br> I know you didn't want anyone.<br> But I must tell you something.<br> Will you listen to me?<br> Yes.<br> I intend to represent your<br> case with complete dignity.<br> There will be no<br> appeal to sentiment,<br> there will be no falling<br> at the mercy of the court.<br> The game will be played<br> according to their own rules.<br> We'll see whether they have the courage<br> to sit in judgment on a man like you.<br> The way I see it,<br> the most important elements in the<br> case are the sterilisation decrees<br> and the Feldenstein-Hoffman affair.<br> Doctor Janning,<br> I must tell you something.<br> I admired you since I was<br> a boy in the university.<br> It was because I thought I<br> might be able to achieve<br> some of the things you have done<br> that saw me through the war.<br> You have been somebody to<br> look up to for all of us.<br> Is that all, Herr Rolfe?<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you.<br> Dr Wieck, do you know the<br> defendant Ernst Janning?<br> Yes, I know him.<br> Will you tell us in what capacity?<br> We served in the Ministry of Justice<br> together from 1929 till 1935.<br> - Did you know him before that?<br> - Yes. He was a law student of mine.<br> - Did you know him well?<br> - Yes.<br> - Was he a protg of yours?<br> - Yes.<br> Why?<br> He was always a man of<br> great intelligence.<br> He was a man born with the<br> qualities of a great legal mind.<br> Dr Wieck, would you, uh...<br> would you tell us, from<br> your own experience,<br> the position of the judge in Germany<br> prior to the advent of Adolf Hitler?<br> The position of the judge was<br> one of complete independence.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Now would you describe<br> the contrast, if any,<br> after the coming to power of<br> National Socialism in 1933?<br> Judges became subject to something<br> outside of objective justice.<br> They were subject to what was necessary<br> for the protection of the country.<br> - Would you explain this, please?<br> - The first consideration of the judge<br> became the punishment of<br> acts against the state,<br> rather than objective<br> consideration of the case.<br> And what other changes were there?<br> The right to appeal was eliminated.<br> The Supreme Court of the Reich was<br> replaced by peoples' and special courts.<br> The concept of race was made a<br> legal concept for the first time.<br> And what was the result of this?<br> The result?<br> The result was to hand over<br> the administration of justice<br> into the hands of the dictatorship.<br> - Dr Wieck...<br> - Colonel Lawson,<br> I'd like to ask a few questions.<br> Did the judiciary protest these<br> laws abridging their independence?<br> A few of them did. Those who did<br> resigned or were forced to resign.<br> Others...<br> adapted themselves to<br> the new situation.<br> Do you think the judiciary was<br> aware of the consequences to come?<br> At first, perhaps not.<br> Later it became clear to<br> anyone who had eyes and ears.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, would you please describe for<br> us the changes in criminal law.<br> Its characteristic was an ever-increasing<br> inflation of the death penalty.<br> Sentences were passed<br> against defendants<br> just because they were Poles or<br> Jews, or politically undesirable.<br> Novel National Socialist<br> measures were introduced,<br> among them sexual sterilisation for<br> those who were categorised as asocial.<br> Was it necessary for judges to wear any<br> distinctive mark on their robes in 1935?<br> The so-called "Fhrer's decree"<br> required judges to wear the insignia<br> of the swastika on their robes.<br> - Did you wear such an insignia?<br> - No.<br> I would have been<br> ashamed to wear it.<br> - Did you resign in 1935?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Did Ernst Janning wear a<br> swastika on his robe?<br> Yes.<br> That's all. Thank you.<br> Herr Rolfe.<br> Herr Justizrat Dr Wieck.<br> You used the phrase "necessary for<br> the protection of the country."<br> Would you explain the<br> conditions in Germany<br> at the time National<br> Socialism came to power?<br> What conditions?<br> Would you say there was<br> widespread hunger?<br> Yes.<br> Would you say there was<br> internal disunity?<br> Yes.<br> - Was there a Communist Party?<br> - Yes.<br> Was it the third largest<br> party in Germany?<br> Mm... yes.<br> Would you say that National Socialism<br> helped to cure some of these conditions?<br> Yes, but at a terrible<br> price, and...<br> Please, confine yourself to<br> answering the questions only.<br> Therefore, was it not possible<br> that a judge might wear a swastika<br> and yet work for what he thought<br> was best for his country?<br> No. It was not possible.<br> Dr Wieck,<br> you were not in the administration<br> from the years 1935 to 1943,<br> by your own admission.<br> Is it not possible that your view of<br> the administration might be distorted?<br> No, it is not.<br> How can you testify about events in the<br> administration if you were not there?<br> I had many friends in the<br> legal administration.<br> There were journals and books.<br> From journals and books?<br> I see.<br> Dr Wieck, you referred to "novel<br> National Socialist measures introduced,<br> among them sexual sterilisation."<br> Are you aware that sexual sterilisation<br> was not invented by National Socialism,<br> but had been advanced for<br> years before as a weapon<br> in dealing with the mentally<br> incompetent and the criminal?<br> Yes, I am aware of that.<br> Are you aware it has advocates among<br> leading citizens in many countries?<br> I am not an expert on such laws.<br> Then permit me to read one to you.<br> This is a High Court opinion<br> upholding such laws in<br> existence in another country.<br> And I quote:<br> "We have seen more than once<br> that the public welfare<br> may call upon their best<br> citizens for their lives."<br> "it would be strange indeed<br> if it could not call upon<br> those who already sap the strength of<br> the state for these lesser sacrifices<br> in order to prevent our being<br> swamped by incompetence."<br> "it is better if, instead of waiting to<br> execute degenerate offspring for crime<br> or to let them starve<br> for their imbecility,<br> society can prevent their propagation<br> by medical means in the first place."<br> "Three generations of<br> imbeciles are enough."<br> - Do you recognise it now, Dr Wieck?<br> - No, sir, I don't.<br> Actually, there is no<br> particular reason you should,<br> since the opinion upholds the sterilisation<br> law in the state of Virginia,<br> of the United States,<br> and was written by that<br> great American jurist<br> Supreme Court Justice<br> Oliver Wendell Holmes.<br> Now, Dr Wieck,<br> in view of what you<br> have just learned,<br> can you still say that sexual sterilisation<br> was a "novel National Socialist measure"?<br> Yes, I can say it,<br> because it was never before used as a<br> weapon against political opponents.<br> Do you personally know of a case<br> where someone was sterilised<br> for political reasons?<br> - I know that such things were done.<br> - That's not the question.<br> Please answer the question.<br> Do you know of a case?<br> I don't know of any specific<br> case or specific date.<br> I am asking if you have any first-hand,<br> personal knowledge of such a case!<br> No, I have no such<br> personal knowledge.<br> Thank you.<br> Dr Wieck,<br> you are aware of the charges in the<br> indictment against Ernst Janning?<br> Yes, I am.<br> Can you honestly say he<br> is responsible for them?<br> Yes, I can.<br> Do you consider yourself<br> free of responsibility?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Dr Wieck, did you ever swear to the<br> Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?<br> Your Honour, I object.<br> The witness doesn't have to answer<br> that question. He's not on trial.<br> All Germany is on trial. This tribunal put<br> it on trial when it indicted Ernst Janning.<br> If responsibility is to be found, the<br> widest latitude is to be permitted.<br> Objection overruled.<br> Did you ever swear to the Civil<br> Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?<br> - Everyone did.<br> - We are not interested in everyone.<br> We are interested in what you did.<br> Would you read the oath from the<br> Reich Law Gazette, March 1933.<br> "I swear that I shall obey the leader of<br> the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler,<br> that I shall be loyal to him,<br> that I will observe the laws<br> and that I will conscientiously<br> fulfil my duties, so help me God."<br> Everyone swore to it.<br> It was mandatory.<br> Yes.<br> But you're such a perceptive man, Dr<br> Wieck. You could see what was coming.<br> You could see that National Socialism<br> was leading Germany to disaster.<br> "It was clear to anyone<br> who had eyes and ears."<br> Didn't you realise what<br> it would have meant<br> if you, and men like you, would<br> have refused to swear to the oath?<br> It would have meant that Hitler could<br> never have come to absolute power!<br> Why didn't you?<br> Dr Wieck, why didn't you?<br> Can you give us an explanation?<br> Has it something to<br> do with your pension?<br> Did it mean more to you<br> than your country?<br> Your Honour, I object to the<br> entire line of questioning<br> and ask that it be<br> stricken from the record.<br> Prosecuting counsel's job<br> is to find responsibility.<br> Your Honour, I made an objection.<br> Prosecution does not want<br> to find responsibility?<br> There is responsibility for more here<br> than swearing to a loyalty oath!<br> There is indeed!<br> - Order.<br> - One thing even the German machine,<br> with its monumental efficiency,<br> has been unable to destroy!<br> - Order!<br> - All the victims!<br> More victims than the world has<br> ever known. They will walk in here...<br> Order! Order!<br> This tribunal will admonish both<br> counsels. It will not tolerate this again.<br> We're not here to listen to such<br> outbursts, but to serve justice.<br> - Your Honour, I made an objection.<br> - The objection is overruled.<br> The witness is excused.<br> - Ever read any books by Janning?<br> - No, I don't think so.<br> - The Meaning of the Law.<br> - How is it? Interesting?<br> All the books by Janning<br> are interesting.<br> They're a picture of an era,<br> its hopes, aspirations.<br> They weren't very<br> different from ours.<br> Listen to this, on the signing<br> of the Weimar constitution.<br> "Now we can look forward to a Germany<br> without guns and bloodshed."<br> "A Germany of justice, where<br> men can live instead of die."<br> "A Germany of purpose, of<br> freedom, of humanity."<br> "A Germany that calls<br> for the best in man."<br> How could a man who<br> wrote words like these<br> be part of sterilisations and murders?<br> How could he be?<br> Dan, there are a lot of things that<br> happened here that nobody understands.<br> I know.<br> But the prosecution is going to have<br> to prove every inch of its allegation<br> against a man like Janning if I'm<br> to pronounce sentence on him.<br> Gentlemen, I'm on my way.<br> - Coming, Ken?<br> - Right.<br> There's just this business on<br> the curtailment of rights.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Dan, my wife is planning a get-together<br> tomorrow at the Grand Hotel.<br> - She wants you to come.<br> - All right. Thank you.<br> And she'd like to provide you with<br> some kind of female companionship.<br> She thought you might<br> be lonely here.<br> No, thanks, Curtiss.<br> Thanks very much.<br> You know how these wives<br> love to play Cupid.<br> - I think I'll keep it stag.<br> - All right.<br> - How about you, Ken?<br> - Thanks. My wife and I are busy.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Dan.<br> Mrs Halbestadt, could I...<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Your Honour, this<br> is Madame Bertholt.<br> This is His Honour, Judge Haywood.<br> Madame Bertholt, this is her house.<br> She came to get some of her<br> belongings from the basement.<br> - I didn't know she was coming tonight.<br> - It's my responsibility, Mrs Halbestadt.<br> I've stored some of my things here until I<br> could get a room large enough for them.<br> - I hope you don't mind.<br> - No. Not at all.<br> You can examine what I<br> have here if you like.<br> - Of course not.<br> - Then I'll just take these out.<br> - Thank you, Mrs Halbestadt.<br> - Let me help you.<br> - I can manage.<br> - I'll just take it outside. Please.<br> Good night.<br> It's heavy. It's full of books and pictures<br> that mean nothing to anyone but me.<br> - Mr Schmidt!<br> - Your Honour.<br> - Would you drive Mrs Bertholt home?<br> - Yes, Your Honour.<br> - I hope you're comfortable here.<br> - Yes, I am. Very.<br> My favourite spot was<br> always the garden.<br> Remind Mr Halbestadt to take<br> good care of the rock garden.<br> You'll get a great deal of<br> pleasure out of it in summer.<br> I'll sit in front, thank you.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Karolinenstrasse 115.<br> - Yes, madam.<br> Sit down, sit down.<br> Mrs Halbestadt, you worked for<br> Mrs Bertholt, didn't you?<br> - Yes, Your Honour.<br> - How long did she live here?<br> Madame Bertholt?<br> Oh, Madame Bertholt and her family<br> have lived here for many generations.<br> Thank you.<br> Your Honour, you came<br> in here for something?<br> Oh! Oh, yeah.<br> I'm just going to make<br> myself a sandwich.<br> We will make it. We will<br> make you anything you want.<br> No, it's nothing. I always<br> did it for myself back home.<br> What would you like? I have some<br> ham and cheese and liverwurst.<br> Cheese will be fine.<br> That's very kind of you.<br> Mr Halbestadt, what was it like,<br> living under National Socialism?<br> - What was it like?<br> - Yes. I mean, uh... day-to-day?<br> I know many people<br> at home like you.<br> You're good people. I believe that.<br> What was it like for you,<br> living under Hitler?<br> We were not political. Mr<br> Halbestadt and I are not political.<br> - Ein Glas fur die Milch, bitte.<br> - Ja.<br> No, but you must have been aware of<br> some of the events that were going on.<br> Many things were going<br> on, Mr Halbestadt.<br> There were parades.<br> Hitler and Goebbels<br> came here every year.<br> What was it like?<br> We never attended meetings. Never.<br> I'm not trying to put you<br> on trial. I'm just, uh...<br> I'm just curious. I'd like to know.<br> - Here's your sandwich, Your Honour.<br> - Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Thank you.<br> For instance, there was a place called<br> Dachau not too many miles from here.<br> Did you ever know what<br> was going on there?<br> We knew nothing about it.<br> Nothing about it.<br> How can you ask if we<br> know anything about that?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Your Honour, we are<br> only little people.<br> We lost a son in the army<br> and our daughter in the bombing.<br> During the war we almost starved.<br> It was terrible for us.<br> I'm sure it was.<br> Hitler... Hitler did<br> some good things.<br> I won't say he didn't<br> do some good things.<br> He built the autobahn.<br> He gave more people work.<br> We won't say he didn't<br> do some good things.<br> But the other things...<br> The things they say he did to the Jews and<br> the rest, we knew nothing about that.<br> Very few Germans did.<br> And if we did know...<br> what could we do?<br> But Mrs Halbestadt<br> said you didn't know.<br> Mrs Bertholt, how did<br> she react to all this?<br> Ah, Madame Bertholt is a very<br> fine woman, Your Honour.<br> I'm sure she is.<br> What about her husband?<br> He was in the army.<br> What happened to him?<br> He was one of the defendants<br> in the Malmedy case.<br> General Bertholt. Karl Bertholt.<br> He was executed, Your Honour.<br> Yes, I know that.<br> The document then states that<br> the photographer Rudolf Lenz<br> is requested to present<br> himself within two weeks<br> at one of the hospitals mentioned<br> below for "medical treatment".<br> Next, prosecution presents<br> affidavit document no.488,<br> which concerns the<br> seamstress Anni Mnch.<br> Document reads as follows:<br> "District court Frankfurt am<br> Main has decided the following:<br> the seamstress Anni Mnch, daughter of<br> Wilhelm Mnch, is to be sterilised."<br> "She is requested to present<br> herself within two weeks<br> at one of the hospitals<br> mentioned below."<br> "if she does not take herself<br> voluntarily, she will be taken by force."<br> Next, document no.449, interrogatories<br> in the German and English text,<br> concerning the farmer's<br> helper Meyer Eichinger.<br> - Your Honour.<br> - What?<br> Defence objects to introduction<br> of these repetitive documents.<br> According to the ruling<br> of the first tribunal,<br> such documents are<br> not even admissible<br> unless supported by independent<br> evidence of their authenticity.<br> Objection sustained.<br> Your Honour, may I ask<br> the defence a question?<br> Yes.<br> Would evidence on sterilisation be<br> admissible if there were a witness?<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you.<br> Prosecution calls the<br> witness Rudolf Petersen.<br> Will you raise your right hand?<br> I swear by God the<br> Almighty and Omniscient<br> that I will speak the pure truth<br> and withhold and add nothing.<br> Yes, I do.<br> Will you please tell the court your<br> full name and place of residence.<br> Rudolf Petersen. Frankfurt am Main.<br> Gretweg, Nummer sieben.<br> When were you born, Mr Petersen?<br> May 20, 1914.<br> And what is your occupation?<br> Baker's helper.<br> I'm a baker's helper.<br> Are your parents living?<br> No.<br> What were the causes<br> of their deaths?<br> Mr Petersen, did they<br> die of natural causes?<br> Ja, ja. Ja. Natural.<br> Now, Mr Petersen, what political<br> party did your father belong to?<br> Communist. The Communist Party.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Now, think back.<br> Do you remember anything unusual that<br> happened to you and your family in 1933,<br> before the Nazis came to power?<br> I mean anything of<br> a violent nature.<br> Ja, ja.<br> - How old were you at the time?<br> - 19.<br> Would you please tell the<br> court what happened?<br> Uh... some...<br> Some SA men broke into<br> the house, our house,<br> and they broke the<br> windows and the door.<br> They called us traitors<br> and they tried to...<br> to beat up my father.<br> And what happened then?<br> My brothers and I,<br> we went to help him.<br> And there was a fight.<br> Finally we got them<br> outside in the street<br> and we beat them up,<br> and turned them over to the police.<br> - Did the police do anything about it?<br> - No.<br> Why not?<br> It was then at the time of<br> the national elections.<br> - The National Socialists came to power?<br> - Ja.<br> Now, Mr Petersen,<br> what happened after 1933, after<br> the Nazis came to power?<br> I got a job on a farm,<br> but for the work, to drive<br> a truck it was necessary.<br> I went to the city building<br> to apply for a license.<br> And what happened there?<br> They took me to an official.<br> Did you ever have any dealings<br> with this official before?<br> He was one of the men who broke<br> into our house that night.<br> What did he say to<br> your application?<br> He said an examination<br> there would have to be.<br> Where was the examination<br> to take place?<br> In the district court of Stuttgart.<br> Who was the presiding<br> justice in the court?<br> Justice Hofstetter.<br> Now, what happened<br> in the courtroom?<br> They asked me my full<br> name and so forth.<br> What else did they ask you?<br> They asked me when Adolf Hitler<br> and Dr Goebbels were born.<br> What did you reply?<br> I told them I didn't know,<br> and also that I didn't care.<br> Did they ask you any<br> more questions?<br> No. They told me that I would be<br> hearing from them in ten days.<br> I see.<br> Mr Petersen,<br> I'd like you to look at something.<br> - Do you recognise it?<br> - Ja.<br> Would you please read<br> it for the tribunal?<br> "District court of Stuttgart."<br> "The baker Rudolf Petersen,<br> born May 20th 1914,<br> son of railway employee<br> Hans Petersen,<br> is to be sterilised."<br> Would you read the last paragraph?<br> "It is therefore requested he<br> present himself within two weeks<br> to one of the hospitals<br> mentioned below."<br> "if he does not betake<br> himself voluntarily,<br> he will be taken by force."<br> Now please read the<br> signature at the bottom.<br> "Presiding Justice Hofstetter."<br> Would you read what is<br> written below the signature?<br> - Below?<br> - Below.<br> "By authority of Ernst Janning,<br> Minister of Justice."<br> Your Honour,<br> may the defence see the<br> file of Mr Petersen?<br> What did you do after you<br> received the letter, Mr Petersen?<br> I ran away. I stayed at the<br> farm of a friend I have.<br> And did you return?<br> - Did I what?<br> - Did you return?<br> Yes.<br> And what happened then?<br> The police came. The police came.<br> - Where did they take you?<br> - To the hospital.<br> Mr Petersen. Excuse me, I wonder if you<br> could speak a little louder, please.<br> To the hospital.<br> - What happened at the hospital?<br> - They kept me there.<br> The nurse who was...<br> Well, she came in anyway.<br> She was to prepare me<br> for the operation.<br> And she said she thought the<br> whole thing was terrible.<br> And then the doctor came in,<br> who was supposed to do the...<br> and he said he thought<br> it was awful.<br> Were you in fact sterilised?<br> Thank you very much, Mr Petersen.<br> That's all.<br> Herr Rolfe.<br> Mr Petersen,<br> you may take your earphones<br> off now, if you want to.<br> Mr Petersen, you say you work as a<br> baker's helper? Is that correct?<br> Yes, that is right.<br> What other occupations<br> have you held?<br> I have worked for my father.<br> - What did your father do?<br> - He was a railroad worker.<br> Yes, but what did he do?<br> He would raise and lower the barrier<br> at the crossing for traffic.<br> And you spoke about your brothers.<br> - How many brothers do you have?<br> - Five.<br> - And sisters?<br> - Four.<br> - Then you are a family of ten?<br> - Yes.<br> What occupations do<br> your brothers have?<br> Labourers.<br> All labourers?<br> I see.<br> Mr Petersen, you said the court at<br> Stuttgart asked you two questions,<br> the birth dates of<br> Hitler and Dr Goebbels.<br> - Is that correct?<br> - Yes. Correct.<br> What else did they ask you?<br> Uh...<br> Nothing else.<br> Are you sure?<br> Are you sure there were no<br> questions about your schooling?<br> Objection!<br> The witness has already<br> answered that question.<br> Objection sustained.<br> May I ask you, Mr Petersen...<br> may I ask you...<br> how long did you attend school?<br> - Six years.<br> - Six years. Why not longer?<br> I had to go to work.<br> Would you consider yourself a<br> very bright fellow at school?<br> School? It was...<br> It was a long while ago. I don't...<br> Perhaps you were not able<br> to keep up with the others<br> and that's why you<br> did not continue?<br> Objection, Your Honour.<br> The witness' school record has no<br> bearing on what happened to him.<br> It was the task of the health court to<br> sterilise the mentally incompetent.<br> Objection overruled.<br> Were you able or were you not<br> able to keep up with the others?<br> I would like to refer to the efficiency<br> report from the school about Mr Petersen.<br> He failed to be promoted and was placed<br> in a class of backward children.<br> You say your parents<br> died of natural causes.<br> Yes.<br> Would you describe in detail the<br> illness your mother died of?<br> She died of her heart.<br> In the last stages of her illness,<br> did your mother show any...<br> mental peculiarities?<br> Mental... No. No.<br> In the decision that<br> came from Stuttgart,<br> it is stated that your mother suffered<br> from hereditary feeble-mindedness.<br> That is not... That is not true.<br> Not true, not true.<br> Can you give us some<br> clarification as to how<br> the Hereditary Health Court in<br> Stuttgart arrived at that decision?<br> It was just something they said<br> to put me on the operating table.<br> - It was just something they said?<br> - Yes!<br> Mr Petersen, there was a simple test<br> that the Health Court used to ask<br> in all cases of<br> mental incompetence.<br> Since you say they did<br> not ask you then,<br> perhaps you can<br> answer it for us now?<br> Form a sentence out of the words<br> "hare", "hunter", "field".<br> Your Honour! Objection!<br> Mr Petersen,<br> was the court in Stuttgart<br> constituted like this one?<br> I don't understand what...<br> Was there an audience?<br> An audience? Yes, yes.<br> Thank you.<br> Objection overruled.<br> Hare, hunter, field, Mr Petersen.<br> Take your time.<br> Hare, hunter, field. Uh...<br> Hare,<br> hunter...<br> They had already made up...<br> When I walked into the court,<br> they had made up their minds.<br> They had made up their minds!<br> They put me in the<br> hospital, like a criminal.<br> I could not say anything,<br> I could not do anything. I...<br> I had to lie there.<br> My... my mother...<br> what you say about her.<br> She was a woman, a servant<br> woman, who worked hard.<br> She was a hardworking woman.<br> And it is not fair...<br> not fair... what you say.<br> I have it here.<br> I want to show you.<br> I have here her picture.<br> I would like you looked at it.<br> I would like you to judge.<br> I want that you tell me,<br> was she feeble-minded?<br> My mother!<br> Was she feeble-minded?<br> Was she?<br> I feel it is my duty to<br> point out to the tribunal<br> that the witness is not in<br> control of his mental processes.<br> I know I'm not.<br> Since that day,<br> I've been half I've ever been.<br> The tribunal does not<br> know how you were before.<br> It can never know.<br> It has only your word.<br> Court is adjourned.<br> That's one problem we have<br> with the prosecution...<br> it's filled with young<br> radicals like Lawson.<br> Is that what Lawson is?<br> A young radical?<br> Well, he was a personal<br> protg of FDR.<br> FDR had a few friends who<br> weren't radicals, didn't he?<br> Name one.<br> - Wendell Wilkie.<br> - Wilkie.<br> Is he your idea of a conservative?<br> As a matter of fact, Dan, I've<br> been wondering how you stand?<br> I'll clarify that for you, Curtiss.<br> I'm a rock-ribbed Republican<br> who thought that Franklin<br> Roosevelt was a great man.<br> Oh. One of those.<br> Max!<br> - Max Perkins. Do you know him?<br> - I don't think so.<br> He's with the United Press.<br> - Max, what are you doing here?<br> - I thought you might kick up a row.<br> I haven't had that much to drink.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry. This is Judge Ives.<br> - Hello.<br> - Mrs Ives.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Judge Haywood, Mrs Bertholt.<br> - We have met.<br> - Yes, we have.<br> - Won't you join us for a drink?<br> - We would like to very much.<br> - Max, will you sit here?<br> - Thank you.<br> Incidentally, Max, I admired your<br> article on Mrs Bertholt very much.<br> It was straight reporting. Her defence<br> of her husband was quite eloquent.<br> Are you going to do a<br> story on these trials?<br> I'll tell you something<br> frankly, Judge.<br> At the moment I couldn't give a<br> story away on the Nuremberg trials.<br> - What do you mean, Mr Perkins?<br> - The American public isn't interested.<br> The war's only been over<br> two years, Mr Perkins.<br> That's right.<br> - May I take your order?<br> - Yes. See what the ladies will have.<br> - How about some more beer, Dan?<br> - No, I think I've had my fill of beer.<br> I'd like to try something<br> else, if I may.<br> Why don't you try some Sonnenberg<br> or Schwalbenwinkel? It's the local wine.<br> - Sonnenberg or...?<br> - Schwalbenwinkel.<br> Yes, I think I'd like that.<br> Some Schwalbenwinkel.<br> - Will you have some?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Shall we stay with the beer, Max?<br> - Fine.<br> Thank you.<br> - You got home all right the other night?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> I don't know what I would<br> have done without the car.<br> You speak English very<br> well, Mrs Bertholt.<br> Thank you.<br> My husband and I spent<br> two years in America.<br> I hope you've had a chance to<br> see something of Nuremberg.<br> I'm afraid mainly the road between<br> my house and the Palace of Justice.<br> And then some places that have to do<br> with the case, historical aspects.<br> The Nazi aspects. You should see some<br> of the other parts of Nuremberg.<br> There are many beautiful things<br> to see in the old part of town,<br> museums we're trying to rebuild.<br> And there's a concert, a piano concert,<br> next week at the old opera house.<br> Arthur Reiss. He was a refugee<br> from Hitler in the early days.<br> We've persuaded him to come back.<br> It ought to be quite an evening.<br> - Would you like to come?<br> - Yes, I would.<br> I'll have them leave a ticket for you at<br> the box office. I'm on the committee.<br> - Thank you very much, Mrs Bertholt.<br> - It's nothing.<br> I have a mission with the Americans,<br> as Mr Perkins can tell you.<br> Oh? What is that?<br> To convince you that<br> we're not all monsters.<br> - Good evening, Colonel.<br> - Colonel, Major Radnitz.<br> Good evening, Mrs Bertholt.<br> - I hope you'll excuse me.<br> - You've just come.<br> No, I must go. Please excuse me.<br> It was awfully nice meeting you.<br> There will be a concert ticket<br> for you at the box office.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Mrs Bertholt.<br> Huh.<br> Mrs Bertholt doesn't hold<br> a burning passion for me.<br> I prosecuted her husband.<br> Many people think a death sentence<br> would not have been passed<br> against General Bertholt today.<br> I'm sure they do.<br> I'm sure there are people who think<br> all the prisoners in Nuremberg<br> should be free today.<br> All of them! Let's...<br> Excuse me.<br> I've had, uh...<br> I've had one or two too many, as might<br> be painfully obvious to you gentlemen.<br> The spectacle this afternoon with Mr<br> Petersen put me off my feed. I'm sorry.<br> Three beers and<br> Schwalbenwinkel, please.<br> Prosit. Prosit.<br> - Schwalbenwinkel.<br> - Schwalbenwinkel.<br> Yes, it's good beer. They<br> make it good in this country.<br> You know...<br> You know, there's one<br> thing about Americans.<br> We're not cut out to be occupiers.<br> We're new at it and we're<br> not very good at it.<br> We come over here,<br> and what do we see?<br> We see this beautiful country.<br> It is beautiful.<br> It's very beautiful.<br> We see the culture that goes<br> back for hundreds of years.<br> We see its gemtlich charm,<br> and the charm of people<br> like, uh... Mrs Bertholt.<br> We got a built-in<br> inferiority complex.<br> We forgive and forget easy.<br> We give the other guy the benefit of<br> the doubt... that's the American way.<br> We beat the greatest war machine<br> since Alexander the Great<br> and now the boy scouts take over.<br> The trouble with you, Colonel, is you'd<br> like to indict the whole country.<br> That might be emotionally<br> satisfying to you,<br> but it wouldn't be exactly<br> practical, and hardly fair.<br> Hardly fair?<br> "Hare",<br> "hunter",<br> "field".<br> That's right, let's be fair.<br> The hare was shot by the<br> hunter in the field.<br> It's really quite simple.<br> Uh...<br> Colonel, I think we<br> ought to be going.<br> Yes. We shouldn't<br> be discussing this.<br> Oh, no, Judge we're fair<br> Americans, and true blue.<br> We mustn't do anything<br> that's out of order.<br> We can't do anything<br> that's out of order.<br> There are no Nazis in Germany.<br> Didn't you know that, Judge?<br> The Eskimos invaded<br> Germany and took over.<br> That's how all those<br> terrible things happened.<br> It wasn't the fault of the Germans,<br> it was the fault of those damn Eskimos!<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> - Good night, Colonel.<br> - Good night.<br> Can I have your attention?<br> Sorry to interrupt your dancing.<br> The following officers are requested<br> to report to their units.<br> Major McCarthy, Major<br> Citron, Major Cantor,<br> Captain Byers, Captain Connell,<br> Captain Douglas, Captain Wolfe,<br> Major Booth and Major Rice.<br> Thank you. You can<br> continue dancing.<br> - Harry! What is it?<br> - The Russians are in Czechoslovakia.<br> Masaryk may have committed suicide.<br> We're sending some units over.<br> What do you think will happen?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> Oh, Judge Haywood.<br> Elsa Scheffler.<br> Guten Abend.<br> Guten Abend.<br> "President Truman responded by calling<br> for an extension of military training."<br> "He stated that he is deeply concerned<br> with the survival of the Western nations<br> in face of the threat<br> from the east."<br> "Threat from the east."<br> Herr Janning, did you hear<br> what is in the paper?<br> Exactly what Hitler said: "The clash<br> for survival between east and west."<br> Ah, he knew. He knew!<br> They'll see that we knew exactly<br> what we were doing all the time.<br> They cannot call us criminals and at<br> the same time ask us to help them.<br> We must stand together now. The most<br> crucial part of this case is coming up.<br> We have fallen on happy<br> times, Herr Hahn.<br> In the old times it would<br> have made your day<br> if I deigned to say<br> "Good morning" to you.<br> Now that we are here in<br> this place together,<br> you feel obliged to tell me<br> what to do with my life.<br> Herr Janning, you<br> must stand with us.<br> It is not good for Germans to turn on one<br> another. We have a common ground now.<br> Listen to me, Herr Hahn.<br> Terrible things have<br> happened to me in my life.<br> But the worst thing<br> that has ever happened<br> is to find myself in the<br> company of men like you.<br> I have nothing in common with<br> you and the party hacks.<br> You have something in common...<br> you were part of the same regime.<br> You stood by that regime,<br> like the rest of us.<br> And there is something<br> else you have in common:<br> you are a German.<br> - Good evening. Did you like it?<br> - Yes, I did. Very much indeed.<br> - Can I drop you?<br> - I only live a few blocks from here.<br> I was going to walk. Would<br> you like to go for a walk?<br> Yes. Yes, I would.<br> I won't need the car now.<br> I'll walk with Mrs Bertholt.<br> - Shall I wait for you?<br> - No, no.<br> I'll wait for you, Your Honour.<br> Vor einem groen Tor<br> Steht' ne Laterne<br> Und steht sie noch davor<br> Da wollen wir uns wiederseh'n<br> Bei der Laterne woll'n wir steh'n<br> Wie einst Lili Marleen<br> Wie einst...<br> The German people love to sing,<br> no matter what the situation.<br> I've noticed that.<br> Do American people sing in<br> bars, too? I've forgotten.<br> No. We're apt to be<br> pretty sullen in bars.<br> Und alle Leute soll'n es seh'n<br> Wenn wir...<br> I wish you understood German.<br> The words are very beautiful.<br> Very sad.<br> Much sadder than the English words.<br> "The German soldier knows he's going<br> to lose his girl and his life."<br> "The lantern burns every night."<br> "it knows your steps<br> and the way you walk."<br> "it burns every night, but<br> I've been long forgotten."<br> "Should harm come to me,<br> who will stand with you<br> under the lantern with you,<br> Lili Marleen."<br> Mit dir Lili Marleen<br> What is your life like in America?<br> - Do you have a family?<br> - Yes, I have a daughter,<br> - and she has four children.<br> - Four?<br> - You must be very proud of them.<br> - Yes, I am. I admit it.<br> - And where's your wife?<br> - She died a few years ago.<br> Zigaretten?<br> - How about you? Do you have children?<br> - No, I don't.<br> What is your position in America?<br> It must be important.<br> No, it isn't really.<br> I'm a district court judge.<br> I haven't even been<br> that for the last year.<br> - Are you retired?<br> - Forcibly, by the electorate.<br> You elect judges in<br> the United States?<br> - Yes, in some states.<br> - I didn't know that.<br> It's either a virtue or a<br> defect of our judiciary system.<br> I thought it was one of the virtues<br> until last year, when I was defeated.<br> I'm sure it was the fault of<br> the electorate, not yours.<br> There seems to be some difference<br> of opinion about that.<br> - This is where I live.<br> - Here?<br> Yes. It's not so bad inside.<br> Would you like to come up?<br> I could make some coffee.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Things haven't been very<br> easy for you, have they?<br> I'm not used to them being easy.<br> I'm not fragile, Judge Haywood.<br> I'm a daughter of the military.<br> - You know what that means, don't you?<br> - No, I'm afraid I don't.<br> It means I was taught discipline.<br> A very special kind of discipline.<br> For instance, as a child we would go for<br> long rides into the country in the summer.<br> But I was never allowed to run to<br> the lemonade stand with the others.<br> I was told "Control your thirst."<br> "Control hunger."<br> "Control emotion."<br> It has served me well.<br> And your husband?<br> Was he of that heritage, too?<br> My husband was a soldier. He was<br> brought up to do one thing...<br> to fight in the battle<br> and fight well.<br> - Is the coffee all right?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> It's ersatz, but I always<br> try to make it strong.<br> It's fine.<br> I'm curious.<br> What do you think of Ernst Janning?<br> Mrs Bertholt, I'm not at liberty to discuss<br> the case outside of the courtroom.<br> Oh, yes. Of course.<br> I knew Ernst Janning a little. We<br> used to attend the same concerts.<br> There was a reception given<br> for Wagner's daughter-in-law.<br> Hitler was there.<br> Ernst Janning was<br> there with his wife.<br> She was very beautiful.<br> Very small, very delicate.<br> She's dead now.<br> Hitler was quite taken with her.<br> He made advances towards<br> her during the reception.<br> He used to do things like<br> that in a burst of emotion.<br> I will never forget the way<br> Ernst Janning cut him down.<br> I don't think anybody did<br> it to him quite that way.<br> He said "Chancellor, I do not object<br> so much that you are so ill-mannered."<br> "I do not object to that so much."<br> "I object that you are<br> such a bourgeois."<br> Hitler whitened, stared at<br> Janning and walked out.<br> Is the coffee really all right?<br> Fine, thank you.<br> Men like Janning, my husband<br> and I, we hated Hitler.<br> I want you to know that.<br> And he hated us.<br> He hated my husband because<br> he was a real war hero,<br> and the little corporal<br> couldn't tolerate that.<br> And he hated him because he married<br> into nobility, which was my family.<br> Hitler was in awe of the<br> nobility, but he hated it.<br> That's why it's so<br> ironic, what happened.<br> You know what happened<br> to my husband?<br> Yes.<br> What did he know of the<br> crimes they cited him for?<br> He was placed on trial with<br> the other military leaders.<br> He was part of the revenge the victors<br> always take on the vanquished.<br> It was political murder.<br> You can see that, can't you?<br> Mrs Bertholt, I don't<br> know what I see.<br> I probably shouldn't be here talking<br> with you about this at all.<br> I want to understand.<br> I do want to understand.<br> I have to.<br> Would you like some more coffee?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> We found Irene Hoffman.<br> - Where?<br> - Berlin.<br> Berlin, eh?<br> She got married. Her name is Wallner<br> now. That's why we couldn't locate her.<br> - When is she coming?<br> - She's not coming.<br> - What do you mean, she's not coming?<br> - She doesn't want to come.<br> You know what it's like. None of<br> them want to testify any more.<br> If I catch the midnight, I can get to<br> Berlin and be back by tomorrow afternoon.<br> - Tad, you haven't slept...<br> - it will be worth it if I can get Hoffman.<br> Take over for me in court<br> in the morning, will you?<br> Colonel, please. I have told you<br> this before when you first came in.<br> I say it again now: we are<br> through with all this.<br> She does not have to go.<br> You have no right to order her to.<br> Mr Wallner, I'm not ordering her to go.<br> I have no authority to do that.<br> Do you think we get a medal<br> for appearing at these trials?<br> The people do not like them, they do not<br> want Germans to testify against Germans.<br> I haven't been prosecuting these cases for<br> the past two years without knowing that.<br> It is easy for you to say go.<br> After the trials you go back to America,<br> but we must live with these people.<br> Mr Wallner, don't you think<br> I realise what I'm asking?<br> How can you come in<br> like the Gestapo...<br> Because they must not be allowed<br> to get away with what they did!<br> Do you really think they won't<br> get away with it in the end?<br> I say the hell with them<br> and the hell with you.<br> Hugo.<br> Emil Hahn will be there?<br> Yes. In the dock.<br> Ernst Janning?<br> Yes.<br> You saw the store downstairs.<br> It's not much, but it's<br> a new start for us.<br> They will come if I<br> go to Nuremberg.<br> They will come and break<br> the windows of the store.<br> I'll place a guard in front<br> of the store 24 hours a day.<br> - You do not have to go, Irene...<br> - Irene, you do have to go.<br> You have to go for all the people who<br> can't get on the stand themselves.<br> - You do not owe it to anybody, Irene.<br> - Yes, you do!<br> You owe it to one person at least.<br> In the night...<br> every night...<br> we've known somehow it<br> would come to this.<br> Dr Geuter, do you<br> recognise that headline?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Would you read it to the tribunal?<br> "Death to the race defiler."<br> - In what newspaper did it appear?<br> - Julius Streicher's Der Strmer.<br> What was it in connection with?<br> The Feldenstein case.<br> What was the Feldenstein case?<br> Your Honour! The defence objects to<br> introduction of the Feldenstein case.<br> It is a notorious case, perhaps<br> the most notorious of the period.<br> It has overtones and appeals to emotion<br> that would perhaps be best not raised.<br> There are no issues or overtones that<br> may not be raised in this courtroom.<br> The tribunal is interested in everything<br> that is relevant. Objection is overruled.<br> It's all right. I'll take it.<br> - May it please the tribunal?<br> - You may continue.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, what was the Feldenstein case?<br> The case of a man accused<br> of racial pollution.<br> Will you explain what is<br> meant by "racial pollution"?<br> This is the charge that is<br> referred to in the Nuremberg laws.<br> Any non-Aryan having sexual relations<br> with an Aryan may be punished by death.<br> When did you first become acquainted<br> with the Feldenstein case?<br> In September 1935 I was<br> contacted by the police.<br> They said that Mr<br> Feldenstein was being held<br> and that he requested that<br> I serve as his counsellor.<br> What position did he<br> hold in the community?<br> He was a very well-known merchant.<br> He was one of the heads of the<br> Jewish Congregation in Nuremberg.<br> What was the nature of<br> the charge against him?<br> He was accused of having<br> intimate relations<br> with a 16-year-old<br> girl, Irene Hoffman.<br> I see.<br> And what did he say to<br> you about the case?<br> He said it was false.<br> He said he knew the girl and<br> her family a long time.<br> He'd gone to visit<br> her since they died.<br> But there had never been anything<br> of the kind charged between them.<br> Doctor, would you please tell the<br> tribunal what happened then?<br> He was indicted before the<br> special court at Nuremberg.<br> Where was this special court?<br> It was right here. This building.<br> This very courtroom.<br> Dr Geuter, what were the<br> circumstances surrounding the trial?<br> It was used as a showplace<br> for National Socialism.<br> It was the time of the September<br> celebrations, the Nuremberg rallies.<br> The courtroom was crowded.<br> Back there, people<br> were standing up.<br> Julius Streicher was sitting<br> in one of the front seats.<br> And high officials of the<br> Nazi party were all over.<br> Doctor, would you please tell us<br> what were your expectations for<br> the trial in this climate?<br> I expected the worst<br> when I saw that Emil Hahn<br> was the public prosecutor.<br> He was a fanatic.<br> His trials were always<br> marked by extreme brutality.<br> But I had one hope for the outcome,<br> because sitting on the judge's<br> bench was Ernst Janning.<br> His reputation was known<br> throughout Germany.<br> He was known to have dedicated<br> his life to justice,<br> to the concept of justice.<br> Thank you. That's all.<br> Any questions?<br> Thank you. No questions.<br> The witness is excused.<br> The prosecution calls to the<br> stand Irene Hoffman Wallner.<br> Will you raise your right hand?<br> I swear by God the<br> Almighty and Omniscient<br> that I will speak the pure truth<br> and withhold and add nothing.<br> I do.<br> Will you please state your<br> name to the tribunal?<br> Irene Hoffman Wallner.<br> Mrs Wallner, did you<br> know Lehman Feldenstein?<br> Yes.<br> When did you first meet him?<br> It was 1925 or 1926.<br> I am not sure exactly.<br> - How old was he at this time?<br> - He was in his fifties.<br> And how old was he at<br> the time of his arrest?<br> - He was 65.<br> - I see.<br> What was the nature<br> of your relationship?<br> We were friends.<br> Did you continue to see him<br> after your parents died?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> We were friends. He owned the<br> building that I lived in.<br> His business took him<br> there quite often.<br> Now, what did you say to the police<br> when they questioned you about<br> having intimate relations with him?<br> I told them it was a lie.<br> Could you tell me who the<br> public prosecutor was?<br> Emil Hahn.<br> - Did Emil Hahn question you?<br> - Yes.<br> What did he say to you?<br> He... took me into a separate room<br> where we were alone.<br> He told me that it was no<br> use to repeat my story<br> because no one would believe me.<br> That there had been<br> race defilement,<br> and the only pardon for this<br> was to kill the violator.<br> He told me that if I<br> protected Mr Feldenstein,<br> that I would be held under<br> arrest for perjury.<br> What did you reply to him?<br> I told him what I had<br> said, again and again.<br> I told him that I could<br> not say anything else,<br> I could not lie about someone<br> who had been so kind to me.<br> Were you held under arrest?<br> Yes.<br> Mrs Wallner, tell us,<br> what was the manner in which Emil<br> Hahn conducted the prosecution?<br> He made a mockery<br> of everything Mr Feldenstein<br> tried to say in his own defence.<br> He held him up to ridicule<br> whenever possible.<br> What was the reaction<br> of the audience?<br> They laughed again and again.<br> How long did the trial last?<br> Mrs Wallner?<br> How long did the trial last?<br> Two days.<br> Was the verdict passed at<br> the end of the second day?<br> Yes.<br> - What was the verdict?<br> - Guilty.<br> And what was the sentence?<br> Mr Feldenstein was<br> sentenced to be executed.<br> I was sentenced to be in prison<br> for two years for perjury.<br> Who was the presiding judge?<br> Ernst Janning.<br> Were the sentences carried out?<br> Thank you very much, Mrs Wallner.<br> That's all.<br> Any questions?<br> Your Honour, I would like to request<br> that the witness be kept available.<br> We will present further evidence<br> on the Feldenstein matter<br> when it comes time for the<br> defence to present its case.<br> The witness will please<br> hold herself so available.<br> You may go. You're excused now.<br> Colonel Lawson.<br> Your Honours, I offer in evidence<br> a decree, signed by Adolf Hitler,<br> directing that all persons accused<br> or suspected of disloyalty<br> or resistance of any sort<br> might be arrested secretly,<br> with no notice to friends or relatives,<br> without any trial whatsoever,<br> and put into concentration camps.<br> I also offer a group of orders<br> issued under that decree,<br> each one signed by one<br> of the defendants,<br> by which hundreds of<br> persons were arrested<br> and placed in concentration camps.<br> Signed by Friedrich Hofstetter,<br> Werner Lampe,<br> Emil Hahn,<br> Ernst Janning.<br> Your Honours, the defendants<br> on trial here today<br> did not personally administer<br> the concentration camps.<br> They never had to beat victims,<br> or pull the lever that released<br> gas into the chambers.<br> But as the documents we have<br> introduced into this case have shown,<br> these defendants fashioned<br> and executed laws,<br> and rendered judgments<br> which sent millions of victims<br> to their destinations.<br> Major Radnitz.<br> Your Honours, I would like to request that<br> Colonel Lawson be sworn in as a witness.<br> - Granted.<br> - Thank you.<br> Will you raise your right hand?<br> I swear by God the<br> Almighty and Omniscient<br> that I will speak the pure truth<br> and withhold and add nothing.<br> I do.<br> Were you active in the United States<br> army in 1945 at the close of the war?<br> Yes, I was.<br> Were you in command of troops<br> liberating concentration camps?<br> I was.<br> - Were you in Dachau and Belsen?<br> - Yes.<br> Were you present when the films<br> we are about to see were taken?<br> Yes, I was.<br> OK.<br> The map shows the number of and<br> location of concentration camps<br> under the Third Reich.<br> Buchenwald concentration<br> camp was founded in 1933.<br> Its inmates numbered about 80,000.<br> There was a motto at Buchenwald:<br> "Break the body,<br> break the spirit,<br> break the heart."<br> The ovens at Buchenwald,<br> evidence of last-minute<br> efforts to dispose of bodies.<br> The stoves were manufactured<br> by a well-known company<br> which also specialised<br> in baking ovens.<br> The name of the firm<br> is clearly inscribed.<br> An exhibit of by-products<br> of Buchenwald,<br> displayed for the local<br> townspeople by an Allied officer.<br> Brushes of every description.<br> Shoes... adults' and children's.<br> Spectacles.<br> Gold from teeth, melted down,<br> sent once a month to the medical<br> department of the Waffen SS.<br> A lampshade made from human skin.<br> Skin being used for paintings,<br> many having an obscene nature.<br> The heads of two Polish labourers,<br> shrunken to one-fifth<br> their normal size.<br> A human pelvis used as an ashtray.<br> Children who had been tattooed to<br> mark them for eventual extermination.<br> Sometimes mercy was<br> shown to the children.<br> They were injected with morphia<br> so they'd be unconscious<br> when hanged.<br> One of the doctors described how they'd<br> then place ropes around their necks,<br> and in the doctor's own words:<br> "Like pictures, they were then<br> hanged by hooks on the walls."<br> The bodies of those who<br> had come in boxcars,<br> without food and without air,<br> who hadn't survived the<br> journey to Dachau.<br> Hundreds of inmates were<br> used as human guinea pigs<br> for atrocious medical experiments.<br> A witness at an execution at Dachau<br> gave the following description:<br> "inmates were made to leave<br> their clothing on a rack."<br> "They were told they were<br> going to take baths."<br> "Then the doors were locked."<br> "Tins of Zyklon B were released through<br> the specially constructed apertures."<br> "You could hear the groaning<br> and the whimpering inside."<br> "After two or three<br> minutes, all was quiet."<br> Death transports that had arrived<br> included 90,000 from Slovakia,<br> and Upper Silesia,<br> and 100,000 from Germany.<br> And this is what was filmed<br> when British troops liberated<br> Belsen concentration camp.<br> For sanitary reasons a British<br> bulldozer had to bury the bodies<br> as quickly as possible.<br> Who were the bodies?<br> Members of every occupied<br> country of Europe.<br> Two-thirds of the Jews<br> of Europe... exterminated.<br> More than six million,<br> according to reports from<br> the Nazis' own figures.<br> But the real figure...<br> no one knows.<br> How dare they show us<br> those films? How dare they?<br> We are not executioners!<br> We are judges.<br> You do not think it was<br> like that, do you?<br> There were executions, yes,<br> but nothing like that.<br> Nothing at all!<br> Pohl!<br> Pohl!<br> You ran those concentration<br> camps, you and Eichmann.<br> They say we killed<br> millions of people.<br> Millions of people!<br> How could it be possible?<br> Tell them!<br> How could it be possible?<br> It's possible.<br> How?<br> You mean technically?<br> It all depends on your facilities.<br> Say you have two chambers that<br> accommodate 2,000 people apiece.<br> Figure it out.<br> It's possible to get rid<br> of 10,000 in a half hour.<br> You don't even need<br> guards to do it.<br> You can tell them they are<br> going to take a shower,<br> and then instead of the<br> water, you tum on the gas.<br> It's not the killing that is the problem.<br> It's disposing of the bodies.<br> That's the problem.<br> Das ist schn<br> Wunderschn<br> Das tut gut<br> Was man alles im Liebesrausch tut<br> Und zur Nacht iegt<br> ein sterndes Fleh'n<br> "ach verweile,<br> du bist ja so schn"<br> Doch die Liebe bleibt<br> nur, wo sie ist<br> Wenn man immer aufs neue sich ksst<br> Und so lebt...<br> - I'm sorry I'm late.<br> - That's all right.<br> I was doing some work for<br> the rebuilding committee.<br> I brought you some folders so we can<br> decide what you should see next.<br> There's the Albrecht Durer house.<br> And the museum.<br> - When do you think you could make it?<br> - Any time.<br> - Would you like to order now?<br> - Can I help you with the menu?<br> I don't think I'll have<br> anything, thank you.<br> A glass of Moselle, please.<br> Moselle.<br> What is the matter?<br> Nothing. I'm just not<br> hungry, that's all.<br> You know...<br> the last few days have<br> meant a great deal to me.<br> How?<br> I don't think you realise what<br> a provincial man I really am.<br> I've been abroad just<br> exactly once before this.<br> That was when I was a<br> doughboy in World War I.<br> I used to pass places like this<br> and wonder what they were like.<br> - They've meant a great deal to me, too.<br> - How?<br> They gave me back the feeling<br> I had of the Americans.<br> The feeling I used to have<br> when I was in your country.<br> It's too bad this isn't<br> a magazine story.<br> Why?<br> If it were, two people like us,<br> the rapidly ageing jurist...<br> Oh, no.<br> The rapidly ageing jurist<br> and the beautiful widow<br> would transcend their difficulties and<br> travel places either by land or by sea.<br> I saw Mr Perkins today.<br> He told me they showed those<br> pictures in the courtroom,<br> Colonel Lawson's<br> favourite pictures.<br> He drags them out at any<br> pretext, doesn't he?<br> Colonel Lawson's private<br> chamber of horrors.<br> Is that what you think we are?<br> Do you think we knew of those things?<br> Do you think we wanted to<br> murder women and children?<br> Do you believe that? Do you?<br> Mrs Bertholt, I don't<br> know what to believe.<br> Good God.<br> We're sitting here drinking.<br> How could you think that we knew?<br> We did not know.<br> We did not know!<br> As far as I can make out,<br> no one in this country knew.<br> Mrs Bertholt, your husband was<br> one of the heads of the army.<br> And he did not know.<br> I tell you, he did not know.<br> It was Himmler. It was Goebbels.<br> The SS knew what happened.<br> We did not know.<br> Listen to me. There are things<br> that happened on both sides.<br> My husband was a military<br> man all his life.<br> He was entitled to a soldier's<br> death. He asked for that.<br> I tried to get that for him. Just that,<br> that he would die with some honour.<br> I went from official to official.<br> I begged for that!<br> That he should be permitted<br> the dignity of a firing squad.<br> You know what happened.<br> He was hanged with the others. And after<br> that, I knew what it was to hate.<br> I never left the house.<br> I never left the room. I drank.<br> I hated with every fibre of my being.<br> I hated every American I've ever known.<br> But one can't live<br> with hate. I know that.<br> Dan,<br> we have to forget if we<br> are to go on living.<br> Du darfst auf mich bauen<br> Weit ja, wie gut ich dir bin<br> Ja, ja, ja, ja<br> Weit doch, wie gut ich dir bin.<br> Und, und, wenn in der Ferne<br> Dir, dir, mein Bild erscheint<br> Dann, dann, wnscht' so gerne<br> Dass uns die Liebe vereint<br> Herr Rolfe.<br> May it please the tribunal.<br> Yesterday the tribunal<br> witnessed some films.<br> They were... shocking films.<br> Devastating films.<br> As a German,<br> I feel ashamed that such things could<br> have taken place in my country.<br> There can never be a<br> justification for them,<br> not in generations,<br> not in centuries.<br> But...<br> I do think it was wrong,<br> indecent<br> and terribly unfair<br> of the prosecution<br> to show such films in this case,<br> in this court, at this time<br> against these defendants!<br> And I cannot protest too<br> strongly against such tactics.<br> What is the prosecution<br> trying to prove?<br> That the German people as a whole<br> were responsible for these events?<br> Or that they were<br> even aware of them?<br> Because, if he is,<br> he's not stating facts<br> and he knows he's not.<br> The secrecy of the operations,<br> the geographical<br> location of the camps,<br> the breakdown of communications<br> in the last days of the war<br> when the exterminations<br> rose into the millions,<br> show only too clearly that<br> he is not telling the truth.<br> The truth is that these brutalities were<br> brought about by the few extremists.<br> The criminals.<br> Very few Germans knew<br> what was going on.<br> Very few.<br> None of us knew what was happening<br> in the places shown on these films.<br> None of us.<br> But the most ironic part of it<br> is that the prosecution showed these<br> films against these defendants,<br> men who stayed in power<br> for one reason only:<br> to prevent worse<br> things from happening.<br> Who is the braver man?<br> The man who escapes or<br> resigns in times of peril?<br> Or the man who stays on his post at<br> the risk of his own personal safety?<br> The defence will present witnesses<br> and letters and documents<br> from religious and political<br> refugees all over the world<br> telling how Ernst Janning<br> saved them from execution.<br> The defence will<br> show the many times<br> Ernst Janning was able to<br> effect mitigation of sentences,<br> when without his influence the<br> results would have been much worse.<br> The defence will show<br> that Ernst Janning's personal<br> physician was a non-Aryan.<br> A Jewish man who he kept in<br> attendance, much to his own peril.<br> The defence presents affidavits<br> from legal authorities and<br> famed jurists the world over,<br> pleading that special consideration<br> must be made in this case,<br> saying that the entire work of Ernst<br> Janning was inspired by one motive only:<br> the endeavour to preserve justice<br> and the concept of justice.<br> Now, what has the prosecution<br> to offer against this?<br> The prosecution, in fact, has presented<br> in the case of Ernst Janning<br> only one tangible<br> piece of evidence.<br> The Feldenstein case. A notorious<br> case, as the defence said.<br> A case which never should<br> have been reopened.<br> A case which the defence<br> is obliged to review now.<br> The defence calls Mrs Elsa Lindnow.<br> Will you raise your right hand?<br> I swear by God the<br> Almighty and Omniscient<br> that I will speak the pure truth<br> and withhold and add nothing.<br> I do.<br> Mrs Lindnow.<br> What is your occupation?<br> I am a cleaning woman.<br> Where are you employed?<br> - Did you know Lehman Feldenstein?<br> - Yes, I knew him.<br> - In what capacity?<br> - He was my employer in 1935.<br> Do you know Mrs Irene<br> Hoffman Wallner?<br> Yes.<br> - In what capacity?<br> - She was a tenant in the building.<br> Did you ever see Miss Hoffman<br> and Mr Feldenstein together?<br> - Yes.<br> - How did this happen?<br> Mr Feldenstein came to see<br> Miss Hoffman at her apartment.<br> - Often?<br> - Quite often.<br> Were there any occasions in which<br> you noticed anything unusual?<br> Yes.<br> I saw Miss Hoffman kissing Mr Feldenstein<br> at the door of her apartment.<br> - Was there any other occasion?<br> - Yes. There was one.<br> - What was it?<br> - I came to Miss Hoffman's apartment.<br> I wanted to clean up.<br> I thought it was empty.<br> I saw Miss Hoffman sitting<br> on Mr Feldenstein's lap.<br> Thank you, Mrs Lindnow. That's all.<br> Colonel Lawson?<br> Earphones, please.<br> Mrs Lindnow, what are your<br> political affiliations?<br> Political?<br> Objection, Your Honour.<br> This witness' political affiliations<br> have nothing to do with the testimony.<br> Colonel Lawson is again trying to<br> appeal to the emotion of the court.<br> Objection overruled.<br> Now would you answer<br> the question, please?<br> Were you a member of the<br> National Socialist party?<br> Yes, I was.<br> We were forced to be.<br> "We were forced to be."<br> When did you become a<br> member of the Nazi party?<br> Were all German nationals forced to<br> become Nazi party members in 1933?<br> Please answer me, Mrs Lindnow!<br> Were you forced to become a<br> member of the Nazi party?<br> That's all.<br> Witness is excused.<br> Defence may continue.<br> The defence calls Irene<br> Hoffman Wallner to the stand.<br> Mrs Wallner,<br> you are still under oath.<br> Mrs Wallner, did you<br> come here voluntarily?<br> Did you report voluntarily<br> to speak as a witness?<br> Yes.<br> Is it not true that the prosecution<br> asked you to come here?<br> That it was very disagreeable<br> for you to come here?<br> It is always very disagreeable<br> to live over those times.<br> That would be in agreement<br> with the information I have,<br> that you did not want to come.<br> Thank you, Mrs Wallner.<br> Mrs Wallner,<br> the Nuremberg laws were<br> stated September 15th, 1935.<br> - Where were you at that time?<br> - In Nuremberg.<br> Did you know these laws?<br> That a physical relationship<br> with Jews was against the law?<br> Yes.<br> Were you aware that in Nuremberg,<br> and in Nuremberg in particular,<br> not only a physical relationship with Jews<br> was disdained, but every social contact?<br> Yes.<br> Were you aware that it might have<br> some danger for you personally?<br> Yes, I was aware of it.<br> But how can you discard a friendship<br> from day to day because of some...<br> That is another question, Mrs Wallner.<br> I did not ask you that question.<br> - Were you aware of it?<br> - Yes, I was aware.<br> Yet you still continued<br> to see each other?<br> Yes.<br> It was brought out that Mr Feldenstein<br> bought you candy and cigarettes.<br> Yes.<br> Remember that sometimes<br> he bought you flowers?<br> Yes, he bought me many things.<br> That was because he was kind.<br> He was the kindest man I ever knew.<br> Do you know the witness,<br> Mrs Elsa Lindnow?<br> Yes, I know her.<br> - Was she a cleaner at your apartment?<br> - Yes.<br> Did Mr Feldenstein come to<br> see you at your apartment?<br> - Yes.<br> - How many times?<br> I don't remember.<br> - Several times?<br> - Yes.<br> - Many times?<br> - Many times.<br> - Did you kiss him?<br> - Yes, I kissed him.<br> Was there more than one kiss?<br> Yes.<br> But it was not in the way you<br> are trying to make it sound.<br> He was like a father to me.<br> He was more than a father.<br> More than a father?!<br> Did you sit on his lap?<br> Objection! Counsel is<br> persecuting the witness<br> in the pretext of<br> gaining testimony.<br> Objection overruled.<br> The defence is re-enacting what was<br> a travesty of justice in the first place.<br> Colonel Lawson, the tribunal makes the<br> rulings in this case, not the prosecution.<br> - You may proceed.<br> - Did you sit on his lap?<br> Yes. But there was nothing<br> wrong or ugly about it.<br> Did you sit on his lap?<br> Yes. But...<br> You sat on his lap!<br> What else did you do?<br> There was nothing that you are<br> trying to say, nothing like that.<br> What else did you do, Mrs Wallner?<br> What are you trying to do?<br> Are you trying to...<br> Why do you not let<br> me speak the truth?<br> That's what we want, Mrs<br> Wallner, the truth. The truth!<br> You admitted that you<br> continued to see him.<br> You admitted that he<br> came to your apartment.<br> You admitted you kissed him.<br> You admitted you sat on his lap.<br> What else do you admit to?<br> What else?<br> Nothing! There was nothing like<br> you're trying to make it sound.<br> - What else?<br> - There was nothing! Nothing.<br> Stop it!<br> Stop it!<br> What else do you admit<br> to, Mrs Wallner?<br> Herr Rolfe!<br> Are we going to do this again?<br> Your Honour, the defendant has been under<br> such stress that he is not aware...<br> I am aware. I am aware.<br> Your Honour, the defendant<br> wishes to make a statement.<br> - I believe the defence has a right to...<br> - Order, order.<br> Order!<br> Does the defendant wish<br> to make a statement?<br> I wish to make a statement, yes.<br> Your Honour, the defence<br> has the right to request...<br> The defendant has the right<br> to make his statement now.<br> - I have to speak with my client.<br> - He has the right to make it now!<br> Tribunal is adjourned until<br> What are you doing?<br> What do you think<br> you're trying to do?<br> They've had Gring, Frank,<br> Streicher... That's over.<br> Do you think I have enjoyed being<br> defence counsel during this trial?<br> There were things I had to do in<br> that courtroom that made me cringe.<br> Why did I do them?<br> Because I want to leave the<br> German people something.<br> I want to leave them<br> a shred of dignity.<br> I want to call a halt<br> to these proceedings.<br> If we allow them to discredit<br> every German like you,<br> we lose the right to<br> rule ourselves forever!<br> We have to look at the future.<br> We can't look back now.<br> Do you want the Americans<br> to stay here forever?<br> I could show you a picture<br> of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br> Thousands and thousands<br> of burnt bodies.<br> Women and children.<br> Is that their superior morality?<br> Where do you think they take us?<br> Do they know?<br> Do you think they have any<br> concept of our problems?<br> What can I say to you?<br> What can I say to you<br> to make you see?<br> There is nothing you can say.<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing has happened<br> to alleviate the crisis.<br> The crisis reached a<br> head this afternoon<br> when all rail travel between western<br> zones and Berlin was stopped.<br> The blockade by land<br> is now complete.<br> What do you think we're going<br> to do, General? Withdraw?<br> We can't. If we withdraw<br> under pressure,<br> our prestige all over the<br> world is threatened.<br> The Communists will<br> move in on every front.<br> What about these trials, General?<br> How do you feel about them now?<br> We're committed to the trials,<br> but I think it would be realistic to<br> accelerate them as much as possible.<br> What would happen if they fired<br> on one of our planes, General?<br> We'll have to face that when it happens.<br> There is no other answer to that now.<br> You should try the strudel.<br> It's excellent here.<br> No, thanks.<br> Dan, I've just come back<br> from Berlin, as you know.<br> I don't think this is going to be it.<br> A lot of people do, but I don't.<br> But it is going to be a fight for survival...<br> for the next ten years, maybe the next 20.<br> Germany is the key<br> to that survival.<br> Any high-school student in<br> geography can tell you that.<br> Just what are you<br> trying to say, Senator?<br> What I'm trying to say is this:<br> while nobody's trying to<br> influence your decision,<br> it's important that you realise<br> this because it's a fact of life.<br> Let's face it, gentlemen,<br> the handwriting is on the wall.<br> We're going to need all<br> the help we can get.<br> We're going to need the<br> support of the German people.<br> More strudel, gentlemen?<br> Herr Janning, you may proceed.<br> I wish to testify about<br> the Feldenstein case<br> because it was the most<br> significant trial of the period.<br> It is important not only for<br> the tribunal to understand it,<br> but for the whole German people.<br> But in order to understand it,<br> one must understand the<br> period in which it happened.<br> There was a fever over the land.<br> A fever of disgrace,<br> of indignity, of hunger.<br> We had a democracy, yes,<br> but it was tom by elements within.<br> Above all, there was fear.<br> Fear of today, fear of tomorrow,<br> fear of our neighbours,<br> and fear of ourselves.<br> Only when you understand that<br> can you understand what<br> Hitler meant to us.<br> Because he said to us:<br> "Lift your heads.<br> Be proud to be German."<br> "There are devils among us...<br> communists, liberals, Jews, Gypsies."<br> "Once these devils will be destroyed,<br> your misery will be destroyed."<br> It was the old, old story<br> of the sacrificial lamb.<br> What about those of<br> us who knew better?<br> We who knew the words were<br> lies and worse than lies?<br> Why did we sit silent?<br> Why did we take part?<br> Because we loved our country.<br> What difference does it make if a few<br> political extremists lose their rights?<br> What difference does it make if a few<br> racial minorities lose their rights?<br> It is only a passing phase.<br> It is only a stage we<br> are going through.<br> It will be discarded<br> sooner or later.<br> Hitler himself will be<br> discarded sooner or later.<br> "The country is in danger!<br> We will march out of the shadows."<br> "We will go forward."<br> "Forward" is the great password.<br> And history tells how well<br> we succeeded, Your Honour.<br> We succeeded beyond<br> our wildest dreams.<br> The very elements of hate and power<br> about Hitler that mesmerised Germany,<br> mesmerised the world!<br> We found ourselves with<br> sudden powerful allies.<br> Things that had been denied to us<br> as a democracy were open to us now.<br> The world said<br> "Go ahead. Take it. Take it!"<br> "Take Sudetenland.<br> Take the Rhineland. Remilitarise it."<br> "Take all of Austria! Take it."<br> And then one day we looked around<br> and found that we were in an<br> even more terrible danger.<br> The ritual began in this courtroom,<br> swept over the land like a<br> raging, roaring disease!<br> What was going to<br> be a passing phase<br> had become the way of life.<br> Your Honour,<br> I was content to sit<br> silent during this trial.<br> I was content to tend my roses.<br> I was even content to let<br> counsel try to save my name...<br> until I realised that<br> in order to save it<br> he would have to raise<br> the spectre again.<br> You have seen him do it.<br> He has done it here<br> in this courtroom.<br> He has suggested that the Third Reich<br> worked for the benefit of people.<br> He has suggested that we sterilised<br> men for the welfare of the country.<br> He suggested that perhaps the old Jew did<br> sleep with the 16-year-old girl after all.<br> Once more, it is being<br> done for love of country.<br> It is not easy to tell the truth.<br> But if there is to be any<br> salvation for Germany,<br> we who know our guilt<br> must admit it,<br> whatever the pain and humiliation.<br> I had reached my verdict<br> on the Feldenstein case<br> before I ever came<br> into the courtroom.<br> I would have found him guilty whatever<br> the evidence. It was not a trial at all.<br> It was a sacrificial ritual, and Feldenstein<br> the Jew was the helpless victim.<br> Your Honour, the defendant is<br> not aware of what he is saying.<br> He is not aware of<br> the implications.<br> I am aware. I am aware!<br> My counsel would have you believe<br> we were not aware of the<br> concentration camps.<br> Not aware.<br> Where were we?<br> Where were we when Hitler began<br> shrieking his hate in the Reichstag?<br> When our neighbours were dragged out<br> in the middle of the night to Dachau?<br> Where were we when every village<br> in Germany has a railroad terminal<br> where cattle cars were filled with children<br> being carried off to their extermination?<br> Where were we when they cried<br> out in the night to us?<br> Were we deaf? Dumb? Blind?<br> Your Honour, I must protest.<br> My counsel says we were not aware of<br> the extermination of the millions.<br> He would give you the excuse<br> we were only aware of the<br> extermination of the hundreds.<br> Does that make us any<br> the less guilty?<br> Maybe we didn't know the details,<br> but if we didn't know, it was<br> because we didn't want to know.<br> - Traitor! Traitor!<br> - Order. Order.<br> Order!<br> Put that man back in his<br> seat and keep him there.<br> I am going to tell them the truth.<br> I am going to tell them the truth if<br> the whole world conspires against it.<br> I am going to tell them the truth<br> about their Ministry of Justice.<br> Werner Lampe, an old man who<br> cries into his Bible now.<br> An old man who profited by<br> the property expropriation<br> of every man he sent to<br> a concentration camp.<br> Friedrich Hofstetter, the good German,<br> who knew how to take orders,<br> who sent men before him to be<br> sterilised, like so many digits.<br> Emil Hahn,<br> the decayed, corrupt bigot,<br> obsessed by the evil<br> within himself.<br> And Ernst Janning,<br> worse than any of them...<br> because he knew what they were,<br> and he went along with them.<br> Ernst Janning, who made his life...<br> excrement...<br> because he walked with them.<br> Your Honour,<br> it is my duty to<br> defend Ernst Janning,<br> and yet Ernst Janning<br> has said he is guilty.<br> There is no doubt<br> he feels his guilt.<br> He made a great error in going<br> along with the Nazi movement,<br> hoping it would be<br> good for his country.<br> But, if he is to be found guilty,<br> there are others who<br> also went along,<br> who also must be found guilty.<br> Ernst Janning said "We succeeded<br> beyond our wildest dreams".<br> Why did we succeed, Your Honour?<br> What about the rest of the world?<br> Did it not know the intentions<br> of the Third Reich?<br> Did it not hear the words of Hitler<br> broadcast all over the world?<br> Did it not read his<br> intentions in Mein Kampf,<br> published in every<br> corner of the world?<br> Where is the responsibility<br> of the Soviet Union,<br> who signed in 1939 the pact with<br> Hitler that enabled him to make war?<br> Are we now to find Russia guilty?<br> Where is the responsibility<br> of the Vatican,<br> who signed in 1933 the<br> concordat with Hitler,<br> giving him his first<br> tremendous prestige?<br> Are we now to find<br> the Vatican guilty?<br> Where is the responsibility of the<br> world leader Winston Churchill,<br> who said in an open letter to<br> the London Times in 1938...<br> "Were England to suffer national<br> disaster, I should pray to God<br> to send a man of the strength of<br> mind and will of an Adolf Hitler."<br> Are we now to find Winston<br> Churchill guilty?<br> Where is the responsibility of<br> those American industrialists<br> who helped Hitler to<br> rebuild his armaments,<br> and profited by that rebuilding?<br> Are we now to find the American<br> industrialists guilty?<br> No, Your Honour. No.<br> Germany alone is not guilty.<br> The whole world is as responsible<br> for Hitler as Germany.<br> It is an easy thing to<br> condemn one man in the dock.<br> It is easy to speak of the "basic<br> flaw" in the German character<br> that allowed Hitler<br> to rise to power,<br> and at the same time ignore<br> the "basic flaw" of character<br> that made the Russians sign pacts with<br> him, Winston Churchill praise him,<br> American industrialists<br> profit by him!<br> Ernst Janning said he is guilty.<br> If he is, Ernst Janning's<br> guilt is the world's guilt.<br> No more and no less.<br> Major, we have to give the military<br> governor every help we can give him.<br> We have to get 700<br> tons in the air a day.<br> This is some operation.<br> Did you ever think we'd be flying<br> coal and tomatoes in these crates?<br> Tad, you and I have been<br> friends a long time.<br> That's why I called you here.<br> What are you going to<br> do in court tomorrow?<br> You know damn well<br> what I'm going to do.<br> I know what you want to do... put them<br> behind bars and throw away the key.<br> You know what's going on here now?<br> Yeah, I know what's going on.<br> You're an army man. You<br> know what we're up against.<br> The others may not, but you do.<br> I'll tell you the truth.<br> I don't know what's going to happen<br> if they fire on one of those planes.<br> I don't know what's<br> going to happen.<br> But if I do know this:<br> if Berlin goes, Germany goes.<br> If Germany goes, Europe goes.<br> That's the way things stand.<br> That's the way they stand.<br> Look, Matt. I'm going<br> to go the limit.<br> And not you, not the Pentagon,<br> not God on his throne is...<br> Who do you think you're talking to?<br> Who the hell do you think<br> you're talking to?<br> When you were marching into<br> Dachau, I was there too.<br> You think I'll ever forget it?<br> I'm not your commanding officer.<br> I can't and won't influence your decision.<br> But I want to give this to you,<br> and I want to give it to you straight.<br> We need the help of<br> the German people.<br> You don't get their help by sentencing<br> their leaders to stiff prison sentences.<br> Tad, the thing to do<br> is survive, isn't it?<br> Survive as best we<br> can, but survive.<br> Just for laughs, Matt.<br> What was the war all about?<br> What was it about?<br> That concludes presentation<br> of documentary evidence<br> against these defendants.<br> Your Honours,<br> during the three years that have passed<br> since the end of the war in Europe,<br> mankind has not crossed<br> over into Jordan.<br> In our own country, fear<br> of war has been revived<br> and we must look once<br> more to our defences.<br> There's talk of cold war while<br> men and women die in real wars,<br> and the echoes of persecution and<br> atrocities will not be stilled.<br> These events cannot help but colour<br> what happens in this courtroom.<br> But somewhere in the<br> midst of these events,<br> the responsibility for the crimes that<br> we brought forward during this trial<br> must be placed in true perspective.<br> And this is the decision<br> that faces Your Honours.<br> It is the dilemma of our times.<br> It is a dilemma that<br> rests with you.<br> The prosecution rests.<br> The defendants may now make<br> their final statements.<br> Defendant Emil Hahn may<br> address the tribunal.<br> Your Honours, I do not evade the<br> responsibility for my actions.<br> On the contrary, I stand by<br> them before the entire world.<br> But I will not follow<br> the policy of others.<br> I will not say of our policy<br> today that it was wrong<br> when yesterday I say it was right.<br> Germany was fighting for its life.<br> Certain measures were needed to<br> protect it from its enemies.<br> I cannot say that I am sorry<br> we applied those measures.<br> We were a bulwark<br> against Bolshevism.<br> We were a pillar of<br> Western culture.<br> A bulwark and a pillar the<br> West may yet wish to retain.<br> The defendant Friedrich Hofstetter<br> may address the tribunal.<br> I have served my country<br> throughout my life,<br> and in whatever position<br> I was assigned to,<br> in faithfulness, with a pure<br> heart and without malice.<br> I followed the concept that I believed<br> to be the highest in my profession,<br> the concept that says:<br> to sacrifice one's own sense of justice<br> to the authoritative legal order,<br> to ask only what the law is,<br> and not to ask whether or<br> not it is also justice.<br> As a judge, I could do no other.<br> I believe Your Honours will find me,<br> and millions of Germans like me,<br> who believed they were doing<br> their duty to their country,<br> to be not guilty.<br> The defendant Werner Lampe<br> may address the tribunal.<br> Your Honours...<br> Your Honours...<br> The defendant Ernst Janning<br> may address the tribunal.<br> I have nothing to add<br> to what I have said.<br> Testimony has been received,<br> final arguments have been heard.<br> There remains nothing now but the task<br> of the tribunal to render its decision.<br> The tribunal will recess<br> until further notification.<br> I've collected<br> precedents and arguments<br> that have a bearing on<br> the basis of the case,<br> which is the conflict between<br> allegiance to international law<br> and to the laws of<br> one's own country.<br> Dan, we have a mountain of<br> material to go over here.<br> - What are you looking at, Dan?<br> - Mm?<br> I was looking at some of these pictures<br> attached to the warrants for arrest.<br> What pictures?<br> There's Petersen before<br> they operated on him.<br> Here's Irene Hoffman.<br> She really was 16 once, wasn't she?<br> Feldenstein.<br> And here's a boy... he certainly<br> couldn't have been more than 14...<br> executed for saying things<br> against the Third Reich.<br> "By order of Justice<br> Friedrich Hofstetter."<br> If I may say so, more pertinent<br> to the legal basis of the case,<br> I have the address of<br> the French prosecutor<br> before the international<br> military tribunal.<br> "It is obvious that, in the state<br> organised along modem lines,<br> responsibility is confined to those<br> who act directly for the state."<br> "Since they alone are in a position to<br> judge the legitimacy of the given orders,<br> they alone can be prosecuted."<br> I have another from<br> Professor Jahreiss...<br> "Legal aspects: trial of<br> the major war criminals".<br> On the basis of these, I don't<br> see where the prosecution<br> has put forth a really clear-cut<br> case against the defence<br> pertaining to the charges<br> in the indictment.<br> Regardless of the acts committed,<br> we cannot make the interpretation<br> that these defendants are really<br> responsible for crimes against humanity.<br> - What do you think, Dan?<br> - We've been going over this all day!<br> If it isn't clear now...<br> Aren't you going to look<br> at these precedents?<br> Aren't you interested at all?<br> I'm interested, Curtiss. You were<br> speaking of crimes against humanity,<br> saying the defendants were not<br> responsible for their acts.<br> I'd like you to explain that to me.<br> - I've just been explaining it.<br> - Maybe.<br> But all I've heard is a lot of legalistic<br> double talk and rationalisation.<br> You know, when I<br> first became a judge<br> I knew there were certain people in<br> town I wasn't supposed to touch.<br> I knew that if I was to<br> remain a judge, this was so.<br> But how in God's name do you<br> expect me to look the other way<br> at the murder of six<br> million people?<br> - I'm sure he didn't mean...<br> - I'm not asking you to look the other way.<br> I'm asking you what good is it<br> going to do to pursue this policy?<br> Curtiss, you were saying that the men<br> are not responsible for their acts.<br> You're going to have<br> to explain that to me.<br> You're going to have to<br> explain it very carefully.<br> The tribunal is now in session.<br> God bless the United States of America<br> and this honourable tribunal.<br> The trial conducted before this<br> tribunal began over eight months ago.<br> The record of evidence is<br> more than 10,000 pages long,<br> and final arguments of<br> counsel have been concluded.<br> Simple murders and atrocities<br> do not constitute the gravamen of<br> the charges in this indictment.<br> Rather, the charge is that<br> of conscious participation<br> in a nationwide, government-organised<br> system of cruelty and injustice,<br> in violation of every moral and legal<br> principle known to all civilised nations.<br> The tribunal has carefully<br> studied the record<br> and found therein abundant evidence<br> to support beyond a reasonable doubt<br> the charges against these defendants.<br> Herr Rolfe, in his<br> very skilful defence,<br> has asserted that there are others<br> who must share the<br> ultimate responsibility<br> for what happened here in Germany.<br> There is truth in this.<br> The real complaining party at the bar<br> in this courtroom is civilisation.<br> But the tribunal does say<br> that the men in the dock<br> are responsible for their actions.<br> Men who sat in black robes,<br> in judgment on other men.<br> Men who took part in the<br> enactment of laws and decrees,<br> the purpose of which was the<br> extermination of human beings.<br> Men who, in executive positions,<br> actively participated in the<br> enforcement of these laws,<br> illegal even under German law.<br> The principle of criminal law<br> in every civilised society<br> has this in common:<br> any person who sways<br> another to commit murder,<br> any person who furnishes the lethal<br> weapon for the purpose of the crime,<br> any person who is an<br> accessory to the crime,<br> is guilty.<br> Herr Rolfe further asserts<br> that the defendant Janning<br> was an extraordinary jurist<br> and acted in what he thought was<br> the best interest of his country.<br> There is truth in this also.<br> Janning, to be sure,<br> is a tragic figure.<br> We believe he loathed<br> the evil he did.<br> But compassion for the<br> present torture of his soul<br> must not beget forgetfulness<br> of the torture and the death of millions<br> by the government of which he was part.<br> Janning's record and his fate<br> illuminate the most shattering truth<br> that has emerged from this trial.<br> If he, and all of the other defendants,<br> had been degraded perverts,<br> if all of the leaders of the Third Reich<br> had been sadistic monsters and maniacs,<br> then these events would have<br> no more moral significance<br> than an earthquake, or any<br> other natural catastrophe.<br> But this trial has shown<br> that under a national crisis<br> ordinary, even able and<br> extraordinary men,<br> can delude themselves into<br> the commission of crimes<br> so vast and heinous that<br> they beggar the imagination.<br> No one who has sat through the<br> trial can ever forget them.<br> Men sterilised because<br> of political belief.<br> A mockery made of<br> friendship and faith.<br> The murder of children.<br> How easily it can happen.<br> There are those in<br> our own country too<br> who today speak of the protection<br> of country, of survival.<br> A decision must be made in<br> the life of every nation.<br> At the very moment when the grasp<br> of the enemy is at its throat,<br> then it seems that the only way to survive<br> is to use the means of the enemy,<br> to rest survival upon<br> what is expedient,<br> to look the other way.<br> Well, the answer to that is...<br> survival as what?<br> A country isn't a rock.<br> It's not an extension<br> of one's self.<br> It's what it stands for.<br> It's what it stands for when standing<br> for something is the most difficult.<br> Before the people of the world,<br> let it now be noted that here, in our<br> decision, this is what we stand for:<br> justice, truth...<br> and the value of a<br> single human being.<br> The marshal will produce before<br> the tribunal the defendant Hahn.<br> Emil Hahn,<br> the tribunal finds you guilty and<br> sentences you to life imprisonment.<br> Today you sentence me. Tomorrow<br> the Bolsheviks sentence you!<br> The marshal will produce the defendant<br> Hofstetter before the tribunal.<br> Fried rich Hofstetter,<br> the tribunal finds you guilty and<br> sentences you to life imprisonment.<br> The marshal will produce the<br> defendant Lampe before the tribunal.<br> Werner Lampe,<br> the tribunal finds you guilty and<br> sentences you to life imprisonment.<br> The marshal will produce the defendant<br> Ernst Janning before the tribunal.<br> Ernst Janning,<br> the tribunal finds you guilty and<br> sentences you to life imprisonment.<br> He doesn't understand.<br> He just doesn't understand.<br> He understands.<br> Justice Ives dissenting.<br> I wish to point out strongly my dissenting<br> vote from the decision of this tribunal<br> as stated by Justice Haywood, and<br> in which Justice Norris concurred.<br> The issue of the actions<br> of the defendants,<br> who believed they were acting in the<br> best interests of their country,<br> is an issue that cannot be<br> decided in a courtroom alone.<br> It can only be decided objectively,<br> in years to come, in the<br> true perspective of history.<br> Where shall I put these<br> books, Your Honour?<br> Put them in the<br> trunk, Mr Halbestadt.<br> Your Honour, here's something<br> for you to have on the plane.<br> Oh, no. If you give me any more food,<br> I won't have any room for anything else.<br> But it's strudel, the<br> way you like it.<br> - Thank you. Thank you for everything.<br> - Ja, ja.<br> - I'll put it in the car.<br> - Thanks.<br> Tickets, passport, immunisation. I'll<br> have your boarding pass at the airport.<br> See you there no later<br> than three o'clock.<br> Oh, and give my regards to Miss...<br> what was her name?<br> Scheffler. Elsa.<br> - That's one you owe me.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Americans aren't very popular<br> in Nuremberg this morning.<br> - Good afternoon, Your Honour.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> I came here at the request<br> of my client, Ernst Janning.<br> He wishes to see you.<br> I'm just leaving for the airport.<br> He says it would mean<br> a great deal to him.<br> Have you heard about the<br> verdict in the IG Farben case?<br> Most of them were acquitted.<br> The others received light sentences.<br> - The verdict came in today.<br> - No, I hadn't heard.<br> I will make you a wager.<br> I don't make wagers.<br> A gentlemen's wager.<br> In five years, the men you sentenced<br> to life imprisonment will be free.<br> Herr Rolfe, I have admired your work<br> in the courtroom for many months.<br> You are particularly brilliant<br> in your use of logic.<br> So, what you suggest<br> may very well happen.<br> It is logical, in view of<br> the times in which we live.<br> But to be logical<br> is not to be right.<br> And nothing on God's earth<br> could ever make it right.<br> Someone to see you.<br> Herr Janning.<br> Judge Haywood.<br> Please, sit down.<br> Thank you. You wanted to see me.<br> Yes. There is something<br> I want to give you.<br> A record.<br> A record of my cases,<br> the ones I remember.<br> I want to give them to<br> someone I can trust,<br> someone I felt I got to<br> know during the trial.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll take good care of them.<br> I know the pressures that<br> had been brought upon you.<br> You will be criticised greatly.<br> Your decision will not<br> be a popular one.<br> But, if it means anything to you,<br> you have the respect of at least<br> one of the men you convicted.<br> By all that is right in this world,<br> your verdict was a just one.<br> Thank you.<br> What you said in the courtroom,<br> it needed to be said.<br> Judge Haywood...<br> The reason I asked you to come...<br> Those people, those<br> millions of people,<br> I never knew it would come to that.<br> You must believe it.<br> You must believe it.<br> Herr Janning, it came to that<br> the first time you sentenced a man<br> to death you knew to be innocent.<br>
