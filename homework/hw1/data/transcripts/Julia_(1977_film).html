I know. By the way,<br> she saw your old friend Julia.<br> - Where?<br> - In Vienna.<br> She's turned into a wild socialist...<br> giving away all her money.<br> Listen, Sammy. You tell Anne Marie...<br> that I don't want to hear any attacks<br> on Julia's belief or on Julia's life.<br> Not from her or from you.<br> - Good-bye, Sammy.<br> - Oh, come on, Lillian! Anne Marie<br> doesn't hold ill thoughts.<br> You understand about relationships.<br> Why, Anne Marie and I were<br> a battleground all our lives.<br> And here's something you don't know.<br> On my graduation day...<br> my little sister cried like an infant.<br> She took my arm and kissed me<br> and gave me a tender touch.<br> And within minutes...<br> within minutes, Lillian, it was done.<br> What I'd wanted to do all those years,<br> she had the same ideas as I had...<br> - tucked up inside her someplace.<br> - Oh, God.<br> And to this day, of all the girls<br> I've ever had, my sister was the best.<br> She was thrilling, Lillian.<br> And did I ever suspect what she had in mind?<br> Not for a minute. Don't look at me like that.<br> She was 16. She was very complicated.<br> Come on now. You're so slick, so unruffled.<br> You have no right to turn up your nose.<br> Your life's no closed book.<br> No one's scot-free, you know. After all,<br> the whole world knows about you and Julia.<br> - What does the whole world know, Sammy?<br> - Oh.<br> - What does the world know?<br> - Oh. [Laughs]<br> Don't be that way. I'm a sophisticated man.<br> If anybody understands the sex urge<br> of the adolescent girl, it's me.<br> Did you know that in Paris the women<br> are wearing watches around their legs?<br> Little garters with timepieces in them.<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> [Man On P.A. Speaking Foreign Language]<br> [Knocking]<br> Good morning. Just to say good-bye<br> to you and have a happy trip.<br> You're across the border now.<br> Your trunk was removed<br> by the Germans yesterday.<br> They kept it. They must be suspicious,<br> but you're in no danger.<br> Do not return from Moscow through Germany.<br> Travel another way.<br> My best regards to your family.<br> Take care of yourself. Bye-bye now.<br> [Performing Hamlet In Russian]<br> [Russian Continues]<br> [Heartbeat Thumping]<br> [Applause]<br> [Chattering In Russian]<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Hellman.<br> Spasiba.<br> [Gasps]<br> [Rustling]<br> [Man]<br> Julia has been killed.<br> Please advise Moore's Funeral Home,<br> Whitechapel Road, London...<br> what disposition.<br> My sorrow for you.

I'm sorry.<br> Well, perhaps John Watson then.<br> I'm sorry. You have the wrong address.<br> - I'm Julia's friend.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - I have a letter from John Watson.<br> - You have the wrong address!<br> [Julia's Voice]<br> She's across the border in Alsace.<br> She lives with a baker's family.<br> [No Audible Dialogue]<br> [Door Chimes Ringing]<br> It's impossible, madame. Alsace<br> is not a village. It is a big province.<br> [Children Shouting]<br> - Hi.<br> - Uh...<br> - Do you speak English?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm from America.<br> Uh, do you know any Americans?<br> Americans?<br> What is it you want, madam?<br> Well, I'm a friend of one that you<br> might know. I'm looking for her baby.<br> I'm very busy, you see.<br> If you don't want bread, I can't help you.<br> - Madam, I'm a friend ofJulia's.<br> - [Both Speaking In French]<br> Do you know about a baby named Lilly?<br> There's no baby here.<br> There's no baby. Just go and have a look.<br> There's no baby. I'm sorry.<br> [Child Shouting]<br> [Ship Horn Blaring]<br> - Do you need this anymore?<br> - Ah, no. That's all right.<br> Is this all you got?<br> Hey.<br> - [Train Idling]<br> - [Lillian Shouting] Mr. Johann!<br> [Shouting Continues, Indistinct]<br> Mr. Johann! Hello!<br> - Mr. Johann!<br> - [Screaming]<br> - [Gasping For Breath]<br> - Lilly. Lilly.<br> - It's all right.<br> - [Gasping Continues]<br> All right. Go back to sleep.<br> - Please, ma'am, you'll have to wait outside.<br> - I will not wait outside.<br> What's the trouble, Anna?<br> Raines, do you remember me?<br> I used to come here<br> with Julia on weekends.<br> Remember, when we were just little children?<br> You remember, her friend, Lillian.<br> - I'm afraid I don't.<br> - Of course, you do.<br> - Please, to step outside, madam.<br> - I will not please...<br> to step anywhere until I talk<br> toJulia's grandparents.<br> - They're on a cruise, madam. They will<br> not be returning for eight weeks.<br> - I don't believe you.<br> - I will take the information...<br> - Julia has been murdered!<br> It's not to be referred to as "information."<br> I have her ashes, and I want them to tell<br> me what I'm supposed to do with them.<br> - If you don't leave, I shall have to call...<br> - She has a child!<br> - Don't they care about<br> their granddaughter's child?<br> - If you don't leave, madam...<br> - I shall have to call the police.<br> - Hello!<br> [Sobbing]<br> [Sniffles, Sobs]<br> [Sobbing Continues]<br> They never wanted to find the baby.<br> [Sobbing]<br> I did.<br> You tried.<br> I didn't try hard enough.<br> You hired detectives. You had lawyers.<br> - You did what you could.<br> - [Weeping] I don't know.<br> They never wanted to find the baby.<br> They wanted Julia's money, and they got it.<br> - I know, the bastards.<br> - So now let it be.<br> There's something else now.<br> There's a war going on over there.<br> [Whimpering Sob]<br> Maybe she's alive in it.<br> The baby's dead, Lilly.<br> [Sobbing]<br> I won't believe that. You don't know that.<br> Lillian! The baby is dead.<br> Julia was and isn't. That's all.<br> [Sighs]<br> And when you die,<br> will you want me to feel that way about you?<br> I'll outlive ya.<br> Oh, maybe not. You're stubborn.<br> [Lillian's Voice]<br> Hammett didn't outlive me.<br> We lived together,<br> off and on, for... 30 years.<br> And I've gone on<br> for a good many years since.<br> Sometimes fine, not always.<br> But he was right. I am stubborn.<br> I haven't forgotten either of them.<br>
