                        Caesar was chosen consul for the fourth time.<br> and went into Spain to make war with the sons of Pompey<br> who were very young.<br> The greatest battle fought between them in this civil war<br> was here, at Munda<br> and they put Caesar himself<br> in great danger of his life.<br> He slew 30 thousands of them in the fields<br> and lost of his own men one thousand of the best he had.<br> This was the last war<br> that Caesar made<br> and on his return to Rome,<br> the people nammed him<br> Perpetual Dictator.<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> Caesar!<br> Hail, Caesar! Caesar!<br> Caesar! Caesar!...<br> Caesar! Caesar!<br> Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:<br> Is this a holiday?<br> You, Sir...<br> what trade art thou?<br> A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe conscience;<br> which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.<br> Thou art a cobbler, art thou?<br> I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes.<br> When they are in great danger, I recover them.<br> But wherefore art not in thy shop today?<br> Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?<br> Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work.<br> But, indeed, sir, we make holiday, to see Caesar<br> and to rejoice in his triumph.<br> Wherefore rejoice?<br> What conquest brings he home?<br> What tributaries follow him to Rome,<br> to grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?<br> You blocks, you stones,<br> you worse than senseless things!<br> O you hard hearts,<br> you cruel men of Rome,<br> knew you not Pompey?<br> Many a time and oft have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,<br> to towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,<br> to see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:<br> and do you now cull out a holiday?<br> And do you now strew flowers in his way<br> that comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?<br> Be gone!<br> Run to your houses,<br> fall upon your knees,<br> Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br> That needs must light on this ingratitude.<br> Ave, Ceasar!<br> Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.<br> Calpurnia!<br> Here, my lord.<br> stand you directly in Antonius' way, when he doth run his course.<br> - Antonius!<br> - Caesar, my lord?<br> Forget not, in your speed, Antonius, to touch Calpurnia;<br> For our elders say,...<br> the barren, touched in this holy chase,<br> shake off their sterile curse.<br> I shall remember:<br> When Caesar says 'do this, ' it is perform'd.<br> Set on; and leave no ceremony out.<br> Caesar!<br> Ha! who calls?<br> Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!<br> Who is it in the press that calls on me?<br> I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,<br> cry 'Caesar!'<br> Speak...<br> Caesar is turn'd to hear.<br> Beware the ides of March.<br> Beware the ides of March.<br> What man is that?<br> A soothsayer bids you<br> beware the ides of March.<br> Set him before me; let me see his face.<br> Fellow, come from the throng;<br> look upon Caesar.<br> What say'st thou to me now?<br> Speak once again.<br> Beware the ides of March.<br> He is a dreamer;<br> let us leave him: pass.<br> Will you go see the order of the course?<br> - Not I.<br> - I pray you, do.<br> I am not gamesome:<br> I do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<br> Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires; I'll leave you.<br> Brutus...<br> I do observe you now of late:<br> I have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love<br> as I was wont to have:<br> You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you.<br> Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?<br> No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself, but by reflection.<br> I have heard, where many of the best respect in Rome,<br> except immortal Caesar,<br> speaking of Brutus and groaning underneath this age's yoke,<br> have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.<br> Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,<br> That you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me?<br> What means this shouting?<br> I do fear, the people choose Caesar for their king.<br> Ay, do you fear it?<br> Then must I think you would not have it so.<br> I would not, Cassius;<br> yet I love him well.<br> I cannot tell...<br> what you and other men<br> think of this life;<br> but, for my single self,<br> I had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as I myself.<br> I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<br> We both have fed as well,<br> and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he:<br> and this man Is now become a god,<br> and Cassius is a wretched creature<br> and must bend his body, if Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br> He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br> and when the fit was on him,<br> I did mark how he did shake:<br> 'tis true, this god did shake.<br> His coward lips did from their colour fly.<br> Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans mark him<br> and write his speeches in their books,<br> alas, it cried<br> 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'<br> as a sick girl.<br> Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br> a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start<br> of the majestic world and bear the palm alone.<br> Another general shout!<br> I believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.<br> Why, man,<br> he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus,<br> and we petty men<br> walk under his huge legs<br> and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves.<br> Men<br> at some time are masters of their fates.<br> the fault, dear Brutus,<br> is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings<br> Brutus and Caesar:<br> what should be in that 'Caesar'?<br> Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br> Write them together,<br> yours is as fair a name.<br> Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well.<br> Weigh them, it is as heavy.<br> Vonjure with 'em, Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.<br> Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br> upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,<br> that he is grown so great?<br> Age, thou art shamed!<br> When went there by an age,<br> since the great flood, when could they say till now,<br> that talk'd of Rome,<br> that her wide walls encompass'd but one man?<br> What you have said I will consider.<br> What you have to say I will with patience hear,<br> and find a time both meet to hear<br> and answer such high things.<br> Till then, my noble friend,<br> chew upon this:<br> Brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of Rome<br> under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us.<br> I am glad that my weak words<br> Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.<br> But, look you, Cassius, the angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,<br> and all the rest look like a chidden train:<br> Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero looks with such ferret<br> and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the Capitol,<br> being cross'd in conference by some senators<br> - Antonius!<br> - Caesar?<br> Let me have men about me that are fat;<br> sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights.<br> Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br> he thinks too much:<br> such men are dangerous.<br> Casca will tell us what the matter is.<br> He's not dangerous;<br> he is a noble Roman and well given.<br> Would he were fatter!<br> But I fear him not:<br> yet if my name were liable to fear,<br> I do not know the man I should avoid so soon as that spare Cassius.<br> He reads much;<br> he is a great observer<br> and he looks quite through the deeds of men:<br> he loves no plays, as thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.<br> Such men as he be never at heart's ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves,<br> and therefore is he very dangerous.<br> I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd than what I fear;<br> for always I am Caesar.<br> Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<br> and tell me truly what thou think'st of him.<br> Casca!<br> - Would you speak with me?<br> - Ay, Casca.<br> tell us what hath chanced today, that Caesar looks so sad.<br> Why, there was a crown offered him.<br> and being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,<br> thus.<br> What was the second noise for?<br> Why, for that too.<br> They shouted thrice.<br> What was the last cry for?<br> Why, for that too.<br> Was the crown offered him thrice?<br> Ay, marry, was't,<br> and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other,<br> and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.<br> - Who offered him the crown?<br> - Why, Antony.<br> Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.<br> I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.<br> It was mere foolery. I did not mark it.<br> I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown--<br> yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets<br> and, as I told you, he put it by once. But, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.<br> Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again.<br> But, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.<br> And then he offered it the 3rd time.<br> he put it the 3rd time by. Still as he refused it,<br> the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps<br> and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown<br> that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.<br> But, soft, I pray you:<br> what, did Caesar swound?<br> He fell down in the market- place, and foamed at mouth, and was speechless.<br> 'Tis very like: he hath the falling sickness.<br> Caesar hath it not.<br> But you and I, and honest Casca,<br> we have the falling sickness..<br> I know not what you mean by that. but he fell down,<br> when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown,<br> he offered them his throat to cut.<br> And so he fell.<br> 3 or 4 wenches, where I stood, cried<br> 'Alas, good soul!'...<br> and forgave him with all their hearts.<br> There's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.<br> - And after that, he came, thus sad, away?<br> - Ay.<br> Did Cicero say any thing?<br> Ay, he spoke Greek.<br> - To what effect?<br> - It was Greek to me.<br> I could tell you more news too.<br> Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images<br> are put to silence.<br> Fare you well.<br> There was more foolery yet,<br> if I could remember it.<br> Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?<br> No, I am promised forth.<br> - Will you dine with me tomorrow?<br> - Ay, if I be alive<br> and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating.<br> Good: I will expect you.<br> Do so. Farewell,<br> both.<br> Till then,<br> think of the world.<br> And after this<br> let Caesar seat him sure.<br> For we will shake him,<br> or worse days endure.<br> Who's there?<br> A Roman.<br> Cassius.<br> what night is this!<br> Who ever knew the heavens menace so?<br> Those that have known the earth so full of faults.<br> Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man most like this dreadful night,<br> A man no mightier than thyself or me<br> in personal action,<br> yet prodigious grown<br> and fearful, as these strange eruptions are.<br> 'Tis Caesar that you mean.<br> Is it not, Cassius?<br> Let it be who it is.<br> Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish Caesar as a king.<br> And he shall wear his crown by sea and land, in every place,<br> save here in Italy.<br> I know where I will wear this dagger then.<br> Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.<br> If I know this, know all the world besides,<br> that part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.<br> So can I!<br> So every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity.<br> And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?<br> What trash is Rome?<br> What rubbish and what offal, when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as Caesar!<br> But,<br> O grief, where hast thou led me?<br> I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman.<br> You speak to Casca,<br> and to such a man that is no fleering tell-tale.<br> Hold,<br> my hand.<br> Be factious for redress of all these griefs,<br> And I will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest.<br> There's a bargain made.<br> Now know you, Casca,<br> I have moved already some certain of the noblest- minded Romans<br> to undergo with me an enterprise of honourable-<br> dangerous consequence.<br> Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.<br> Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait. He is a friend.<br> Cinna!...<br> - Where haste you so?<br> - To find out you.<br> Who's that? Metellus Cimber?<br> No, it is Casca;<br> one incorporate to our attempts.<br> I am glad on 't.<br> What a fearful night is this!<br> There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.<br> - Am I not stay'd for? tell me.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> O Cassius, if you could but win the noble Brutus to our party--<br> Be you content.<br> Good Cinna,<br> take this paper,<br> and look you lay it in the praetor's chair, where Brutus may but find it<br> and throw this in at his window.<br> set this up with wax upon old Brutus' statue<br> all this done, repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.<br> - I will hie. And so bestow these papers as you bade me.<br> - Do so.<br> Come, Casca,<br> you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house.<br> three parts of him is ours already,<br> and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours.<br> It must be by his death!<br> And for my part, I know no personal cause to spurn at him.<br> He would be crown'd.<br> How that might change his nature, there's the question.<br> It is the bright day that brings forth the adder<br> and that craves wary walking.<br> The taper burneth in your closet, sir.<br> Searching the window for a flint, I found this paper, thus seal'd up.<br> And, I am sure, it did not lie there when I went to bed.<br> Get you to bed again; it is not day.<br> Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?<br> I know not, sir.<br> 'Brutus, thou sleep'st.<br> Awake, and see thyself.<br> Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?"<br> What?<br> Rome?<br> 'Speak,<br> strike,<br> redress!'<br> O Rome, I make thee promise.<br> Thou shall receive thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!<br> They are the faction.<br> O conspiracy!<br> I think we are too bold upon your rest:.<br> Good morrow, Brutus.<br> Do we trouble you?<br> I have been up this hour, awake all night.<br> Know I these men that come along with you?<br> Yes, every man of them.<br> and no man here but honours you.<br> And every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself<br> which every noble Roman bears of you.<br> This is Trebonius.<br> He is welcome hither.<br> This, Decius Brutus.<br> He is welcome too.<br> This, Casca.<br> This, Cinna.<br> And this, Metellus Cimber.<br> They are all welcome.<br> Shall I entreat a word?<br> Here lies the east.<br> Doth not the day break here?<br> No.<br> O, pardon, sir, it doth.<br> And yon gray lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day.<br> You shall confess that you are both deceived.<br> Here, as I point my sword,<br> the sun arises.<br> Give me your hands all over, one by one.<br> - And let us swear our resolution.<br> - No, not an oath.<br> What need we any spur but our own cause, to prick us to redress?<br> what other bond than secret Romans, that have spoke the word, and will not palter?<br> And what other oath than honesty<br> to honesty engaged, that this shall be,<br> or we will fall for it?<br> Can no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?<br> Decius, well urged<br> I think it is not meet, Mark Antony,<br> so well beloved of Caesar,<br> should outlive Caesar.<br> We shall find of him a shrewd contrive.<br> Let Antony and Caesar fall together.<br> Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, to cut the head off<br> and then hack the limbs, like wrath in death and envy afterwards.<br> For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.<br> Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<br> We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar.<br> And in the spirit of men there is no blood<br> O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit, and not dismember Caesar!<br> But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it!<br> And, gentle friends, let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully<br> Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br> Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.<br> And for Mark Antony, think not of him<br> for he can do no more than Caesar's arm, when Caesar's head is off.<br> Yet I fear him.<br> For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar.<br> Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.<br> If he love Caesar, all that he can do is to himself,<br> take thought and die for Caesar.<br> and that were much he should; for he is given to sports,<br> to wildness and much company.<br> But it is doubtful yet, whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no.<br> For he is superstitious grown of late.<br> It may be, these apparent prodigies, the unaccustom'd terror of this night,<br> and the persuasion of his augurers,<br> may hold him from the Capitol to-day.<br> Never fear that.<br> If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him.<br> for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betray'd with trees,<br> and bears with glasses, elephants with holes,<br> lions with toils and men with flatterers.<br> But when I tell him he hates flatterers, he says he does, being then most flattered.<br> Let me work; for I can give his humour the true bent, and I will bring him to the Capitol.<br> The morning comes upon 's, Brutus.<br> And, friends,<br> disperse yourselves.<br> But all remember what you have said,<br> and show yourselves true Romans.<br> Brutus, my lord!<br> Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?<br> It is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition<br> to the raw cold morning.<br> Nor for yours neither.<br> You've ungently, Brutus, stole from my bed.<br> Dear my lord,<br> Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.<br> I am not well in health, and that is all.<br> Brutus is wise,<br> and, were he not in health, he would embrace the means to come by it.<br> Why, so I do.<br> Good Portia, go to bed.<br> Is Brutus sick?<br> and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning?<br> What, is Brutus sick<br> And will he steal out of his wholesome bed<br> to dare the vile contagion of the night<br> and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air<br> to add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus.<br> You have some sick offence within your mind<br> which, by the right and virtue of my place, I ought to know of.<br> and, upon my knees, I charm you,<br> by my once-commended beauty,<br> by all your vows of love<br> and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one<br> that you unfold to me, yourself, your half,<br> why you are heavy,<br> and what men to-night have had to resort to you.<br> for here have been some 6 or 7, who did hide their faces even from darkness.<br> Kneel not, gentle Portia.<br> I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.<br> Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,<br> is it excepted I should know no secrets that appertain to you?<br> Am I your wife but, as it were, in sort or limitation,<br> to keep with you at meals, comfort your bed and talk to you sometimes?<br> Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure?<br> If it be no more,<br> Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.<br> You are my true and honourable wife,<br> As dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart.<br> If this were true, then I should know this secret.<br> I grant I am a woman.<br> but withal a woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.<br> I grant I am a woman.<br> but withal a woman well-reputed.<br> Cato's daughter.<br> think you I am no stronger than my sex, being so father'd and so husbanded?<br> Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.<br> I have made strong proof of my constancy.<br> O ye gods, render me worthy of this noble wife!<br> By and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart.<br> Caesar<br> Caesar, beware of Brutus...<br> take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca...<br> have an eye to Cinna, trust not Trebonius...<br> mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus<br> loves thee not. There's but it's bent against Caesar.<br> Beware the ides of March.<br> March... March... March.<br> March... March... March<br> Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night.<br> Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out.<br> 'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!'<br> - Who's within?<br> - My lord?<br> Go bid the priests do present sacrifice<br> - and bring me their opinions of success.<br> - I will, my lord.<br> What mean you, Caesar?<br> Think you to walk forth?<br> You shall not stir out of your house to-day.<br> Caesar shall forth.<br> The things that threaten'd me ne'er look'd but on my back.<br> When they shall see the face of Caesar, they are vanished.<br> Caesar,<br> I never stood on ceremonies,<br> Yet now they fright me.<br> There is one within,<br> besides the things that we have heard and seen, recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<br> A lioness hath whelped in the streets.<br> and graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead.<br> Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds, in ranks and squadrons and right form of war,<br> which drizzled blood upon the Capitol!<br> The noise of battle hurtled in the air,<br> horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,<br> And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<br> Oh, Caesar!<br> These things are beyond all use,<br> and I do fear them.<br> What can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?<br> Yet Caesar shall go forth.<br> for these predictions are to the world in general as to Caesar.<br> When beggars die, there are no comets seen.<br> The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.<br> The valiant never taste of death but once.<br> Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,<br> it seems to me most strange that men should fear.<br> Seeing that death, a necessary end.<br> Will come when it will come.<br> What say the augurers?<br> They would not have you to stir forth to-day.<br> Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,<br> they could not find a heart within the beast.<br> The gods do this in shame of cowardice.<br> Caesar should bea beast without a heart, if he should stay at home to-day for fear.<br> No, Caesar shall not.<br> Danger knows full well that Caesar is more dangerous than he.<br> We are two lions litter'd in one day,<br> and I the elder and more terrible.<br> And Caesar shall go forth.<br> Alas, my lord,<br> your wisdom is consumed in confidence.<br> Do not go forth to-day!<br> Call it my fear that keeps you in the house, and not your own.<br> We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house.<br> And he shall say you are not well to-day.<br> Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.<br> Mark Antony shall say I am not well,<br> And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.<br> Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.<br> Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.<br> I come to fetch you to the senate-house.<br> And you are come in very happy time, to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that I will not come to-day.<br> Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser.<br> I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.<br> Say he is sick.<br> Shall Caesar send a lie?<br> Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far, to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?<br> Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.<br> Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,<br> Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.<br> The cause is in my will: I will not come;<br> That is enough to satisfy the senate.<br> But for your private satisfaction, because I love you,<br> I will let you know:<br> Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.<br> She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,<br> which, like a fountain with<br> Many lusty Romans came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it.<br> And these does she apply for warnings, and portents, and evils imminent.<br> and on her knee hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.<br> This dream is all amiss interpreted.<br> It was a vision fair and fortunate.<br> Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,<br> in which so many smiling Romans bathed, signifies that from you great Rome shall suck reviving blood,<br> and that great men shall press for tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.<br> This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.<br> And this way have you well expounded it.<br> I have,<br> when you have heard what I can say.<br> And know it now: the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.<br> If you shall send them wordyou will not come, their minds may change.<br> Besides, it were a mock apt to be render'd, for some one to say<br> 'Break up the senate till another time,<br> when Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'<br> If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper:<br> 'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?<br> How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!<br> I am ashamed I did yield to them.<br> Give me my robe, for I will go.<br> And look where Publius is come to fetch me.<br> Good morrow, Caesar.<br> What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?<br> Good morrow, Casca.<br> Now, Cinna,<br> now, Metellus,<br> what, Trebonius!<br> See! Antony,<br> that revels long o' nights,<br> is notwithstanding up.<br> - Good morrow, Antony.<br> - Good morrow, noble Caesar.<br> Good friends,<br> go in, and taste some wine with me.<br> And we, like friends, will straightway go together.<br> 'Caesar, beware of Brutus.<br> Take heed of Cassius.<br> come not near Casca.<br> Have an eye to Cinna.<br> Trust not Trebonius.<br> Mark well Metellus Cimber.<br> Decius Brutus loves thee not.<br> The ides of March are come.<br> Ay, Caesar,<br> but not gone.<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> Read this schedule.<br> Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread, at your best leisure, this his humble suit.<br> O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit that touches Caesar nearer.<br> Read it, great Caesar.<br> What touches us ourself shall be last served.<br> Delay not, Caesar! read it instantly!<br> What, is the fellow mad?<br> What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol.<br> I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.<br> What enterprise, Popilius?<br> Fare you well.<br> What said Popilius Lena?<br> He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.<br> I fear our purpose is discovered.<br> Look, how he makes to Caesar Mark him.<br> Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.<br> Brutus, what shall be done?<br> If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, for I will slay myself.<br> Cassius, be constant.<br> Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes. For, look, he smiles,<br> and Caesar doth not change.<br> Trebonius knows his time. For, look you, Brutus.<br> He draws Mark Antony out of the way.<br> Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go, and presently prefer his suit to Caesar.<br> He is address'd: press near and second him.<br> Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.<br> Are we all ready?<br> What is now amiss that Caesar and his senate must redress?<br> Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar!<br> Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart,--<br> I must prevent thee, Cimber.<br> These couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men,<br> and turn pre-ordinance and first decree into the law of children.<br> Be not fond, to think that Caesar bears such rebel blood<br> that will be thaw'd from the true quality with that which melteth fools.<br> I mean, sweet words, low-crooked court'sies<br> and base spaniel-fawning.<br> Thy brother by decree is banished.<br> If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.<br> Know, Caesar doth not wrong,<br> nor without cause will he be satisfied.<br> Is there no voice more worthy than my own<br> to sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear for the repealing of my banish'd brother?<br> I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,<br> desiring thee that Publius Cimber<br> may have an immediate freedom of repeal.<br> What, Brutus!<br> Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!<br> As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall<br> to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.<br> I could be well moved, if I were as you!<br> If I could pray to move, prayers would move me.<br> But I am constant as the northern star,<br> of whose true-fix'd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament.<br> The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,<br> they are all fire and every one doth shine,<br> but there's but one in all doth hold his place.<br> So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men, and men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive.<br> Yet in the number I do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank,<br> unshaked of motion: and that I am he,<br> let me a little show it, even in this; that I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,<br> and constant do remain to keep him so.<br> - O Caesar,--<br> - Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?<br> Great Caesar,--<br> Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?<br> Speak, hands for me!<br> Et tu, Brute!<br> Then fall, Caesar.<br> Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!<br> Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.<br> Some to the common pulpits, and cry out:<br> 'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'<br> People and senators, be not affrighted!<br> Fly not! Stand still!<br> ambition's debt is paid!<br> - Go to the pulpit, Brutus!<br> - And Cassius too!<br> Stand fast together. Lest some friend of Caesar's should chance--<br> Talk not of standing!<br> Publius, good cheer!<br> There is no harm intended to your person, nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.<br> And leave us, Publius. lest that the people, rushing on us, should do your age some mischief!<br> Do so! and let no man abide this deed, but we the doers.<br> - Where is Antony?<br> - Fled to his house amazed.<br> Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run as it were doomsday.<br> Stoop, Romans, stoop,<br> and let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood.<br> Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,<br> and, waving our red weapons o'er our heads, let's all cry 'Peace,<br> freedom and liberty!'<br> Stoop, then, and wash.<br> How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over<br> in states unborn and accents yet unknown!<br> How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,<br> that now on Pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust!<br> So oft as that shall be,<br> so often shall the knot of us be call'd the men that gave their country liberty.<br> - What, shall we forth?<br> - Ay, every man away!<br> Brutus shall lead. And we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.<br> Soft! who comes here?<br> Welcome, Mark Antony.<br> O mighty Caesar!<br> Dost thou lie so low?<br> Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,<br> shrunk to this little measure?<br> Fare thee well.<br> I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<br> Who else must be let blood? Who else is rank?<br> If I myself, there is no hour so fit as Caesar's death hour,<br> nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords,<br> made rich with the most noble blood of all this world.<br> I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br> fulfil your pleasure.<br> Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die.<br> No place will please me so, no mean of death, as here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br> the choice and master spirits of this age.<br> O Antony, beg not your death of us.<br> Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<br> as, by our hands and this our present act, you see we do,<br> yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done.<br> Our hearts you see not.<br> They are pitiful.<br> For your part,<br> to you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.<br> Your voice shall be as strong as any man's<br> in the disposing of new dignities.<br> Only be patient till we have appeased the multitude, beside themselves with fear,<br> and then we will deliver you the cause, why I, that did love Caesar<br> when I struck him, have thus proceeded.<br> I doubt not of your wisdom.<br> Let each man render me<br> his bloody hand.<br> First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.<br> Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.<br> Caesar,<br> If thy spirit look upon us now, shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,<br> to see thy Anthony making his peace,<br> shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes<br> -Most noble!- in the presence of thy corse?<br> Mark Antony,--<br> Pardon me, Caius Cassius.<br> Will you be prick'd in number of our friends?<br> Or shall we on, and not depend on you?<br> Friends am I with you all, and love you all.<br> Upon this hope,<br> that you shall give me reasons why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.<br> Or else were this a savage spectacle.<br> Our reasons are so full of good regard that were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,<br> you should be satisfied.<br> That's all I seek.<br> And am moreover suitor that I may produce his body to the market-place,<br> and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, speak in the order of his funeral.<br> You shall, Mark Antony.<br> Brutus, a word with you.<br> You know not what you do.<br> Do not consent that Antony speak in his funeral.<br> Know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter?<br> By your pardon.<br> I will myself into the pulpit first,<br> and show the reason of our Caesar's death.<br> What Antony shall speak, I will protest he speaks by leave and by permission,<br> and that we are contented Caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.<br> It shall advantage more than do us wrong.<br> I know not what may fall.<br> I like it not.<br> Mark Antony,<br> here, take you Caesar's body.<br> You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,<br> But speak all good, you can devise of Caesar,<br> and say you do't by our permission.<br> Else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral.<br> and you shall speak in the same pulpit<br> whereto I am going, after my speech is ended.<br> Be it so. I do desire no more.<br> Prepare the body then, and follow us.<br> O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,<br> that I am meek and gentle with these<br> butchers!<br> Thou art the ruins of the noblest man<br> that ever lived in the tide of times.<br> Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<br> Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--<br> A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.<br> Domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of Italy!<br> Blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar<br> that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarter'd with the hands of war.<br> And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,<br> with Ate by his side come hot from hell, shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry 'Havoc,'<br> and let slip the dogs of war.<br> - You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?<br> - I do, Mark Antony.<br> Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.<br> He did receive his letters, and is coming.<br> And bid me say to you by word of mouth--<br> O Caesar!--<br> Passion, I see, is catching.<br> Is thy master coming?<br> He lies tonight within 7 leagues of Rome.<br> Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome.<br> No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.<br> Hie hence, and tell him so.<br> Yet, stay awhile.<br> Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse into the market-place.<br> I try there how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men.<br> We will be satisfied! let us be satisfied!<br> Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.<br> Cassius,<br> go you into the other street, and part the numbers.<br> Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here.<br> Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; and public reasons shall be rendered<br> of Caesar's death.<br> The noble Brutus is ascended.<br> Silence!<br> Be patient till the last.<br> Romans,<br> countrymen,<br> and lovers!<br> Hear me for my cause,<br> and be silent.<br> Believe me for mine honour,<br> and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe.<br> Censure me<br> in your wisdom,<br> and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.<br> If there be any in this assembly,<br> any dear friend of Caesar's,<br> to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.<br> If then that friend demand<br> why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:<br> Not that I loved Caesar less,<br> but that I loved Rome more.<br> Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,<br> than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men?<br> As Caesar loved me,<br> I weep for him.<br> As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.<br> As he was valiant, I honour him.<br> but, as he was ambitious,<br> I slew him.<br> There is tears<br> for his love,<br> joy for his fortune,<br> honour for his valour<br> and death<br> for his ambition.<br> Who is here so base<br> that would be a bondman?<br> If any, speak!<br> For him have I offended.<br> Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?<br> If any, speak.<br> For him have I offended.<br> Who is here so vile that will not love his country?<br> If any, speak.<br> For him have I offended.<br> I pause for a reply.<br> None, Brutus, none.<br> None.<br> Then none<br> have I offended<br> Here comes his body,<br> mourned by Mark Antony,<br> who, though he had no hand in his death,<br> shall receive the benefit of his dying,<br> a place in the commonwealth.<br> As which of you shall not?<br> With this I depart.<br> That, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome,<br> I have the same dagger for myself,<br> when it shall please my country to need my death.<br> Live, Brutus!<br> Live, Brutus!<br> - Give him a statue with his ancestors.<br> - Let him be Caesar.<br> Caesar's better parts shall be crown'd in Brutus.<br> We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.<br> - My countrymen,--<br> - Peace, silence!<br> - Brutus speaks.<br> - Peace!<br> Good countrymen,<br> let me depart alone,<br> and, for my sake, stay here with Antony.<br> Do grace to Caesar's corpse,<br> and grace his speech tending to Caesar's glories<br> which Mark Antony, by our permission, is allow'd to make.<br> I do entreat you, not a man depart,<br> Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.<br> Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.<br> We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.<br> For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.<br> What does he say of Brutus?<br> He says, for Brutus' sake,<br> he finds himself beholding to us all.<br> 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.<br> This Caesar was a tyrant.<br> That's certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him.<br> - You gentle Romans,--<br> - Peace, ho! let us hear him.<br> Friends,<br> Romans,<br> countrymen,<br> lend me your ears.<br> I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br> The evil that men do lives after them.<br> The good is oft interred with their bones.<br> So let it be with Caesar.<br> The noble Brutus<br> hath told you Caesar was ambitious.<br> If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br> and grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.<br> Here,<br> under leave of Brutus<br> and the rest--<br> For Brutus is an honourable man.<br> So are they all,<br> all honourable men--<br> Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.<br> He was my friend,<br> faithful and just to me.<br> But Brutus says he was ambitious.<br> And Brutus is an honourable man.<br> He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br> whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br> Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br> When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.<br> Ambition should be made of sterner stuff!<br> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious.<br> And Brutus is an honourable man.<br> You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br> which he did thrice refuse.<br> Was this ambition?<br> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious.<br> And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br> I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br> but here I am to speak what I do know.<br> You all did love him once, not without cause.<br> What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br> Judgment! hou art fled to brutish beasts,<br> And men have lost their reason.<br> Bear with me.<br> My heart is there with Caesar,<br> and I must pause till it come back to me.<br> Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.<br> If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br> Caesar has had great wrong.<br> Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place.<br> Mark'd ye his words?<br> He would not take the crown.<br> Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.<br> There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.<br> But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world.<br> Now lies he there.<br> And none so poor to do him reverence.<br> O masters,<br> if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br> I should do Brutus wrong,<br> and Cassius wrong,<br> who, you all know, are honourable men.<br> I will not do them wrong.<br> I rather choose to wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, than I will wrong such honourable men.<br> But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar.<br> I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.<br> Let but the commons hear this testament which,<br> pardon me, I do not mean to read--<br> and they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood,<br> Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br> And, dying, mention it within their wills.<br> The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.<br> Silence!<br> Have patience, gentle friends,<br> I must not read it.<br> It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<br> You are not wood, you are not stones, but men<br> and, being men, bearing the will of Caesar, it will inflame you, it will make you mad.<br> 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs.<br> For, if you should, O, what would come of it!<br> Read the will!<br> Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?<br> I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.<br> I fear I wrong the honourable men<br> whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar I do fear it!<br> - They were traitors!<br> - The will! the testament!<br> You will compel me, then, to read the will?<br> The will!<br> Read the will!<br> Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, and let me show you him that made the will.<br> Shall I descend?<br> And will you give me leave?<br> Stand far off.<br> You all do know this mantle.<br> I remember the first time ever Caesar put it on.<br> 'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,<br> that day he overcame the Nervii.<br> Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.<br> See what a rent the envious Casca made!<br> Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd.<br> And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away, mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it.<br> For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.<br> Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<br> This was the most unkindest cut of all<br> for when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br> ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, quite vanquish'd him.<br> Then burst his mighty heart. And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br> even at the base of Pompey's statua,<br> which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br> O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br> Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.<br> Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold our Caesar's vesture wounded?<br> Look you here!<br> Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.<br> - O piteous spectacle!<br> - O noble Caesar!<br> Stay, countrymen.<br> Good friends, sweet friends.<br> Let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br> They that have done this deed are honourable.<br> What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, that made them do it.<br> They are wise and honourable, and will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br> I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.<br> I am no orator, as Brutus is,<br> but, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br> that love my friend.<br> And that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him.<br> For I have neither wit, nor words,<br> nor worth, action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, to stir men's blood.<br> I only speak right on.<br> I tell you that which you yourselves do know.<br> Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<br> and bid them speak for me.<br> but were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony,<br> there were an Antony would ruffle up your spirits<br> and put a tongue in every wound of Caesar<br> that should move the stones of Rome to rise<br> and mutiny!<br> Yet hear me, countrymen! Yet hear me speak!<br> Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.<br> Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?<br> Alas, you know not!<br> I must tell you then.<br> You have forgot the will I told you of.<br> Here is the will,<br> and under Caesar's seal.<br> To every Roman citizen he gives, to every several man,<br> Moreover,<br> he hath left you all his walks,<br> his private arbours and new-planted orchards, on this side Tiber.<br> He hath left them you, and to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,<br> to walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.<br> Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?<br> Come, away!<br> We'll burn his body in the holy place!<br> Now let it work.<br> Mischief, thou art afoot,<br> Take thou what course thou wilt!<br> - How now, fellow!<br> - Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.<br> - Where is he now?<br> - He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.<br> He comes upon a wish.<br> Fortune is merry,<br> and in this mood will give us any thing.<br> I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.<br> Belike they had some notice of the people,<br> How I had moved them.<br> Let's go to Brutus to Cassius!<br> Burn all!<br> Away!<br> Go.<br> These many, then, shall die?<br> Their names are prick'd.<br> Your brother too must die.<br> Consent you, Lepidus?<br> I do consent--<br> Prick him down, Antony.<br> Upon condition Publius shall not live,<br> Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.<br> He shall not live.<br> Look,<br> with a spot I damn him.<br> Brutus and Cassius are levying powers.<br> We must straight make head.<br> Therefore let our alliance be combined, our best friends made, our means stretch'd<br> and let us presently go sit in council.<br> Let us do so.<br> For we are at the stake, and bay'd about with many enemies.<br> And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, millions of mischiefs.<br> Lepidus, go you fetch Caesar's will<br> hither, we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies.<br> What, shall I find you here?<br> Or here, or at the Capitol.<br> This is a slight unmeritable man,<br> meet to be sent on errands.<br> Is it fit, the 3-fold world divided,<br> he should stand 1 of the 3 to share it?<br> He's a tried and valiant soldier.<br> So is my horse, Octavius.<br> Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.<br> Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?<br> And, if not so, how should wrong a brother?<br> Before the eyes of both our armies here, which should perceive nothing but love from us, let us not wrangle.<br> Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs. And when you do them--<br> Cassius, be content. Speak your griefs softly.<br> I do know you well.<br> Let no man come to our tent till we've done our conference.<br> Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.<br> That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:<br> you have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella for taking bribes here of the Sardians.<br> Wherein my letters, praying on his side, because I knew the man, were slighted off.<br> You wronged yourself to write in such a case.<br> In such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment.<br> Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself are much condemn'd to have an itching palm.<br> To sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers.<br> I an itching palm!<br> You know that you are Brutus that speak this,<br> or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.<br> The name of Cassius honours this corruption, and chastisement doth therefore hide his head.<br> Chastisement!<br> Remember March,<br> the ides of March remember!<br> Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?<br> What, shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world<br> but for supporting robbers, shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes?<br> And sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus?<br> I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, than such a Roman.<br> Brutus, bay not me. I'll not endure it! You forget yourself, to hedge me in.<br> I am a soldier, I,<br> older in practise, abler than yourself to make conditions.<br> - Go to; you are not, Cassius.<br> - I am.<br> - I say you are not.<br> - Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.<br> Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.<br> - Away, slight man!<br> - Is't possible?<br> Hear me, for I will speak.<br> Must I give way and room to your rash choler?<br> Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?<br> O ye gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?<br> All this! ay, more.<br> Fret till your proud heart break!<br> Go show your slaves how choleric you are, and make your bondmen tremble.<br> Must I budge? Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch under your testy humour?<br> By the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen, though it do split you.<br> or, from this day forth, I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, when you are waspish.<br> Is it come to this?<br> You say you are a better soldier.<br> Let it appear so. Make your vaunting true, and it shall please me well!<br> For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.<br> You wrong me every way. You wrong me, Brutus.<br> I said, an elder soldier, not a better.<br> Did I say 'better'?<br> If you did, I care not.<br> When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.<br> Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.<br> - I durst not!<br> - No!<br> - What, durst not tempt him!<br> - For your life you durst not!<br> Do not presume too much upon my love.<br> I may do that I shall be sorry for.<br> You have done that you should be sorry for.<br> I did send to you for gold to pay my legions, which you denied me.<br> Was that done like Cassius?<br> Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?<br> When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous, to lock<br> such rascal counters from his friends.<br> Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts.<br> - Dash him to pieces!<br> - I denied you not.<br> - You did.<br> - I did not!<br> He was but a fool that brought my answer back.<br> Brutus hath rived my heart.<br> A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,<br> but Brutus makes mine greater than they are.<br> I do not, till you practise them on me.<br> - You love me not.<br> - I do not like your faults.<br> A friendly eye could never see such faults.<br> A flatterer's would not, though they do appear as huge as high Olympus.<br> Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come!<br> Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, for Cassius is aweary of the world.<br> Hated by one he loves,<br> braved by his brother,<br> cheque'd like a bondman,<br> all his faults observed,<br> set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,t o cast into my teeth!<br> O, I could<br> weep my spirit from mine eyes!<br> There is my dagger,<br> and here my naked breast.<br> Within, a heart dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold!<br> If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth!<br> I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart!<br> Strike, as thou didst at Caesar,<br> for, I know, when thou didst hate him worst,<br> thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst Cassius.<br> Sheathe your dagger.<br> Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.<br> O Cassius,<br> you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire.<br> who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark<br> and straight is cold again.<br> Hath Cassius lived to be but<br> mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<br> when grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?<br> When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.<br> Do you confess so much?<br> - Give me your hand.<br> - And my heart too.<br> Lucilius and Titinius,<br> bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies to-night.<br> And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you immediately to us.<br> Lucius, a bowl of wine!<br> I did not think you could have been so angry.<br> O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.<br> Portia is dead.<br> Portia!<br> She is dead.<br> How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?<br> O insupportable and touching loss!<br> Upon what sickness?<br> Impatient of my absence,<br> and grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony have made themselves so strong<br> -for with her death that tidings came-<br> with this she fell distract,<br> and, her attendants absent,<br> swallow'd fire.<br> And died so?<br> Even so.<br> O ye immortal gods!<br> Speak no more of her.<br> Give me a bowl of wine.<br> In this<br> I bury all unkindness, Cassius.<br> My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.<br> Come in, Titinius!<br> Welcome, good Messala.<br> Now sit we close about this taper here,<br> and call in question our necessities.<br> Portia, art thou gone?<br> No more, I pray you.<br> Messala,<br> I have here received letters, that young Octavius<br> and Mark Antony Come down upon us<br> with a mighty power, bending their expedition toward Philippi.<br> Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.<br> What do you think of marching to Philippi presently?<br> - I do not think it good.<br> - Your reason?<br> 'Tis better that the enemy seek us.<br> So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, doing himself offence.<br> Whilst we, lying still,<br> are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.<br> Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.<br> The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground<br> do stand but in a forced affection.<br> For they have grudged us contribution.<br> - Hear me, good brother.<br> - Under your pardon.<br> You must note beside, that we've tried the utmost of our friends.<br> Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.<br> The enemy increaseth every day. We, at the height, are ready to decline.<br> There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.<br> Omitted,<br> all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br> On such a full sea are we now afloat.<br> and we must take the current when it serves,<br> or lose our ventures.<br> Then, with your will, go on.<br> We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.<br> The deep of night is crept upon our talk, and nature must obey necessity.<br> Which we will niggard with a little rest.<br> - There is no more to say?<br> - No more. Good night.<br> Early tomorrow will we rise, and hence.<br> Lucius! My gown.<br> Farewell, good Messala.<br> Good night, Titinius.<br> Noble,<br> noble Cassius,<br> good night, and good repose.<br> O my dear brother!<br> This was an ill beginning of the night.<br> Never come such division 'tween our souls!<br> Let it not, Brutus.<br> Every thing is well.<br> Good night, my lord.<br> Good night, good brother.<br> Good night, Lord Brutus.<br> Farewell, every one.<br> How ill this taper burns!<br> Ha! who comes here?<br> I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<br> that shapes this monstrous apparition.<br> It comes upon me.<br> Art thou any thing?<br> Art thou some god,<br> some angel, or some devil?<br> That makest my blood cold<br> and my hair to stare?<br> Speak to me what thou art.<br> Thy evil spirit, Brutus.<br> Why comest thou?<br> To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.<br> Well. then I shall see thee again?<br> Ay, at Philippi.<br> Now, Antony,<br> our hopes are answered:<br> you said the enemy would not come down,<br> It proves not so. Their battles are at hand. But keep the hills and upper regions.<br> They mean to warn us at Philippi here,<br> Answering before we do demand of them.<br> I am in their bosoms, and I know wherefore they do it.<br> They could come down With fearful bravery,<br> thinking by this face to fastenin our thoughts that they have courage.<br> But 'tis not so.<br> Prepare you, generals!<br> The enemy comes on in gallant show.<br> Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,<br> and something to be done immediately.<br> Octavius,<br> lead your battle softly on,<br> upon the left hand of the even field.<br> Upon the right hand I.<br> Keep thou the left.<br> Why do you cross me in this exigent?<br> I do not cross you, but I will do so.<br> They stand, and would have parley.<br> Stand fast, Titinius.<br> We must out and talk.<br> - Make forth; the generals would have some words.<br> - Stir not until the signal.<br> Words before blows!<br> Is it so, countrymen?<br> Not that we love words better, as you do.<br> Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.<br> In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.<br> When your vile daggers hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.<br> You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,<br> and bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet.<br> You flatterers!<br> Flatterers!<br> Now, Brutus, thank yourself.<br> This tongue had not offended so to-day,<br> if Cassius might have ruled.<br> Come, come, the cause.<br> If arguing make us sweat, the proof of it will turn to redder drops.<br> Look!<br> I draw a sword against conspirators!<br> When think you that the sword goes up again?<br> Never, till Caesar's 3 and<br> or till Octavius Caesar have added slaughter<br> to the sword of traitors.<br> Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands.<br> So I hope.<br> I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.<br> O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, young man,<br> thou couldst not die more honourable.<br> A peevish schoolboy,<br> worthless of such honour,<br> join'd with a masker and a reveller!<br> Old Cassius still!<br> Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth!<br> If you dare fight to-day, come to the field.<br> If not, when you have stomachs.<br> Come, Antony, away!<br> Why, now, blow wind,<br> swell billow and swim bark!<br> The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.<br> Now, most noble Brutus,<br> the gods to-day stand friendly,<br> that we may, lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!<br> This same day must end that work the ides of March begun.<br> And whether we shall meet again I know not.<br> Therefore our everlasting farewell take.<br> For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!<br> If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.<br> If not, why then, this parting was well made.<br> For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!<br> If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed.<br> If not, 'tis true<br> this parting was well made.<br> Why, then, lead on.<br> O, that a man might know the end of this day's business ere it come!<br> But it sufficeth that the day will end,<br> and then the end is known.<br> Ride, ride, Messala, ride,<br> and give these bills unto the legions on the other side.<br> Let them set on at once.<br> For I perceive but cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,<br> and sudden push gives them the overthrow.<br> Ride, Messala, ride!<br> Let them all come down.<br> Be thou my witness, Messala,<br> that against my will,<br> am I compell'd to set upon one battle all our liberties.<br> Coming from Sardis,<br> on our former ensign<br> and there they perch'd, gorging and feeding from our soldiers' ands.<br> This morning are they fled away and gone.<br> In their steads do ravens, crows and kites, fly o'er our heads<br> and downward look on us, as we were sickly prey.<br> Their shadows seem a canopy most fatal,<br> under which our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.<br> Believe not so.<br> I but believe it partly.<br> For I am fresh of spirit<br> and resolved to meet all perils very constantly.<br> Go back!<br> O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!<br> This ensign here of mine<br> was turning back I slew the coward!<br> O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early.<br> Who, having some advantage on Octavius, took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,<br> whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.<br> Fly further off, my lord,<br> fly further off!<br> Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.<br> This hill is far enough.<br> Look, look, Titinius.<br> Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?<br> Titinius, if thou lovest me, mount thou my horse,<br> and hide thy spurs in him, that I may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy.<br> Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill!<br> My sight was ever thick.<br> Regard Titinius.<br> And tell me what thou notest about the field.<br> This day I breathed first.<br> This is my birthday.<br> Time is come round.<br> And where I did begin,<br> there shall I end.<br> My life is run his compass.<br> Sirrah, what news?<br> Titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen,<br> that make to him on the spur.<br> Yet he spurs on.<br> Now they are almost on him.<br> And, hark! they shout for joy.<br> Come down, behold no more.<br> O, coward that I am, to live so long,<br> to see my best friend ta'en before my face!<br> Sirrah, come hither.<br> In Parthia did I take thee prisoner<br> and then I swore thee, saving of thy life,<br> that whatsoever I did bid thee do, thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath.<br> Now be a freeman<br> and with this good sword, that ran through Caesar's bowels,<br> search this bosom.<br> Stand not to answer!<br> take thou the hilts; and, when my face is cover'd<br> as 'tis now,<br> guide thou the sword.<br> Caesar,<br> thou art revenged,<br> even with the sword that kill'd thee.<br> He is slain.<br> O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!<br> Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords<br> in our own proper entrails.<br> The sun of Rome is set!<br> Our day is gone.<br> Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?<br> Did I not meet thy friends?<br> and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory,<br> and bid me give it thee?<br> Didst thou not hear their shouts?<br> The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!<br> Friends,<br> I owe more tears to this dead man<br> than you shall see me pay.<br> I shall find time, Cassius,<br> I shall find time.<br> Et tu, Brute?<br> This is not Brutus, friend.<br> Keep this man safe.<br> Come, poor remains of friends,<br> rest on this rock.<br> Good Volumnius; list a word.<br> - What says my lord?<br> - Why, this, Volumnius:<br> The ghost of Caesar<br> hath appear'd to me<br> At Sardis once,<br> and, this last night, here<br> in Philippi fields.<br> I know my hour is come.<br> Not so, my lord.<br> Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.<br> Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.<br> Our enemies have beat us to the pit.<br> It is more worthy to leap in ourselves, than tarry till they push us.<br> Good Volumnius,<br> thou know'st that we 2 went to school together.<br> Even for that our love of old, I prithee,<br> hold thou my sword-hilts,<br> whilst I run on it.<br> That's not an office for a friend, my lord.<br> Fly, my lord, fly.<br> There is no tarrying here.<br> Farewell to you, and you, Volumnius.<br> Countrymen,<br> my heart doth joy that yet in all my life<br> I found no man but he was true to me.<br> I shall have glory by this losing day<br> more than Octavius and Mark Antony<br> by this vile conquest shall attain unto.<br> So fare you well at once,<br> for Brutus' tongue hath almost ended his life's history.<br> Night hangs upon mine eyes.<br> My bones would rest,<br> that have but labour'd to attain this hour.<br> Fly, my lord, fly.<br> - Hence! - I will follow.<br> I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.<br> Thou art a fellow of a good respect.<br> Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it.<br> Hold then my sword,<br> and turn away thy face, while I do run upon it.<br> Wilt thou, Strato?<br> Give me your hand first.<br> - Fare you well, my lord.<br> - Farewell, good Strato.<br> Caesar, now be still.<br> I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.<br> - What man is that?<br> - My master's man.<br> Where is thy master?<br> Free from the bondage you are in, my lord.<br> The conquerors can but make a fire of him.<br> For Brutus only overcame himself.<br> And no man else hath honour by his death.<br> How died he, Strato?<br> I held the sword, and he did run on it.<br> This was the noblest Roman of them all.<br> All the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great Caesar.<br> He only, in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.<br> His life was gentle,<br> and the elements<br> so mix'd in him that Nature might stand up<br> and say to all the world:<br> 'This was a man!'<br>
