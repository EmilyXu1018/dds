Good luck.<br> Thank you.<br> So now we're onto the 3rd of 3 pieces<br> by Zeppelin Crespo tonight.<br> I believe this to be the best one...<br> at least the most interesting<br> and unusual.<br> This is what Crespo called<br> a head trumpet painting<br> or sometimes a flubug painting.<br> These were made during<br> a very brief period<br> between Crespo's incarcerations<br> and when public health records<br> first indicated a diagnosis of autism.<br> This painting,<br> lot number 21, is titled<br> "My True Love, True, True, True."<br> Let's start the bidding<br> for this amazing work at $7,000.<br> Ladies and gentlemen do I have $7,000<br> for this wonderful Crespo?<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Can I have $7,500 for a good cause?<br> $7,500, Bernadette has on the phone.<br> Do I have $8,000 in the back row,<br> sir, with the hat.<br> You like this one?<br> Let's get it to $8,500.<br> Come on people,<br> I know there's money in this crowd.<br> - $9,000, for this beautiful...<br> - It makes me happy.<br> But I'm going to buy the UFO.<br> $9,500, Bernadette has on the phone.<br> Do I have $10,000?<br> Where did you come from?<br> North Carolina<br> Allright, Charlie, I'll be right here.<br> Mr Wark.<br> Hello?<br> A Tweeleree repeating rifle...<br> I'm guess you never hear'd<br> that before, have you?<br> No sir, I haven't.<br> Well, I recon,<br> you never have<br> because it come to me in a vision.<br> Now, here...<br> I couldn't finish Lee's cock on the front...<br> so I painted around on the back.<br> That's General Lee's cock?<br> Ya.<br> Now this other one over here...<br> Madeline, he is really great.<br> I'm serious.

OK.<br> You are so great. Really.<br> Let me think about it.<br> And I'll call you back. OK bye.<br> He says he thinks it would make<br> a difference if I went down there.<br> Is this the Battle of Antietam?<br> Which one?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I recognize the corn fields.<br> I love all the dog head men.<br> And computers.

Tell me.<br> That's because she come to me<br> in a dream. I dreamed that.<br> And I put it in the mouth<br> of a nigger slave right there<br> in that picture after getting captured.<br> Bless his heart.<br> Who is that out there?<br> That's my husband George.<br> You met him.<br> He's got a nice face.<br> Oh, he's from here.<br> His family lives not too far away.<br> The Johnstons.

Don't mess. Go sit or something.<br> I can't! I'm too excited.<br> - Ashley, sit down!<br> - What's she like?!<br> Have you thought of anything? Huh?<br> 'Cause I know if we have a little boy<br> that we'll name him Johnny,<br> but I was thinking that if we have<br> a girl we could name her Jonni too,<br> but just spell it with an "I".<br> What do you think?<br> I think it's stupid.<br> Well, so are you. You're stupid too.<br> Johnny, Ashley, Pat, Eugene.<br> Peg.<br> Peg. What did I say?<br> What did I say?<br> I'll be fine, right?<br> I'll be fine.<br> Was that a car door?<br> I thing they're here.<br> They're here!<br> Oh lord!<br> Damn it. Look at this mess!<br> Are you coming?<br> You haven't seen your brother<br> in 3 years!<br> Quit it!<br> I'd think you'd want to know what's<br> going on with him and welcome him.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake.<br> Come on Eugene, George is here.<br> George is here.<br> You're here! You're here!<br> You're here right where we live!<br> Hi! Hello!<br> Hi! Look at you. You're here.<br> - You're about to burst.<br> - I know. I wrote you about it.<br> You're so thin.<br> - Hi, Momma.<br> - Darling. I'm so glad to see you.<br> I thought you'd never get here.<br> Guess what's upstairs?<br> Mr. Johnsten.<br> Hi!<br> Wow, you're so beautiful!<br> Fermented cheese just for you.<br> - Hi, Pat.<br> - Hi.<br> How do you do?<br> Do you diet?<br> No. I run. And swim.<br> What was that?<br> I smashed your birdie!<br> - No, darling...<br> - Ashley!<br> I just bumped the wall. I'm sorry.<br> We can replace it. Can't we replace it?<br> I declare, Ashley.<br> I'll pick it up! I'll pick it up!<br> Let me do it.<br> No, wait a minute.<br> You go on, upstairs and I'll see<br> if we got anything to feed you<br> after I clean up Ashley' mess.<br> You still got 3 left.<br> No wonder he's thin.<br> She sure don't look like she can cook.<br> I love her.<br> Johnny?<br> I'm Madeleine. I married George.<br> You got any cigarettes?<br> What? No. Sorry. I don't smoke.<br> George got any?<br> Oh. George doesn't smoke.<br> He give it up?<br> I can tell you're brothers.<br> You're just as handsome.<br> He give up being an asshole, yet?<br> Madeleine?<br> What was that?<br> Madeleine, I'd swim too,<br> but I wouldn't be caught dead<br> in a bathing suit like this.<br> See, I'm about to have a baby.<br> No!<br> I am too. Any day now.<br> But I've got this exercise book,<br> and I'm trying to lose weight<br> 'cause Johnny hates it when I'm heavy.<br> And I can't stand it either.<br> Do you have kids?<br> Oh no. No.<br> Have you ever been married before?<br> When did you and George get married?<br> It'll be exactly 6 months tomorrow.<br> I'll be damned.<br> I know. I actually find it hard<br> to believe myself.<br> How's Johnny?<br> Good.<br> He still working at Replacements Ltd?<br> Still there. Back living here.<br> It's good you come down here.<br> I want to know everything<br> there is to know about you.<br> I want you to tell us<br> every little thing.<br> God. That would be so boring.<br> Not to me.<br> What makes you tick?<br> All we got is dry cereal for you.<br> That's fine, Pat.<br> Can I do anything to help?<br> No. Nobody messes in my kitchen.<br> Oh, OK. Pat, your little ceramic thing.<br> It wasn't...<br> Are you wearing make-up?<br> 'Cause, you could wear more<br> if you wanted to.<br> You're so tall. I'm fair.<br> But, I like to experiment<br> with a lot of different looks.<br> Were you born in Chicago?<br> I was born right here.<br> I've lived here all my whole life.<br> My favorite animal is the meerkat.<br> Do you know what they are?<br> They're so cute.<br> I've got this little charm bracelet<br> with meerkats on it.<br> Did you have lots of boyfriends?<br> I bet you did.<br> Did you ever try out<br> for cheerleading or anything?<br> I tried out, but I didn't make it.<br> I was born in Japan.<br> You were not.<br> My father was in the diplomatic service.<br> And then we moved to Africa.<br> And then to Washington, DC<br> for a short while<br> and then back to Africa<br> and then to Chicago.<br> Wow. What kind of things did you like<br> to do when you were a little girl?<br> What type of things?<br> Reading and horseback riding.<br> At the same time?<br> No. I never tried it at the same time.<br> Do you have any brothers or sisters?<br> I have a half-brother now<br> but he's gone now.<br> So that's why<br> this is pretty much my family.<br> And children<br> are the most important thing.<br> They're so important.<br> Can you still have kids?<br> Ashley!<br> George wrote that you own<br> a art museum or something?<br> Yes. An outsider gallery.<br> Self-taught artists.<br> That's my cellphone.<br> Don't worry, I'll just call back.<br> And that's why we're here really.<br> We drove down to meet-have you heard<br> of this artist from Pinnacle... David Wark?<br> Wark?<br> He lives about half an hour away.<br> Most people haven't heard of him yet.<br> Anyway we drove down to meet him.<br> For the gallery.<br> I wouldn't think you'd have to come all<br> the way down here from Chicago<br> to find a good artist.<br> And I insisted to George...<br> I said if we're this near anyway,<br> let's come here.<br> You drove all that way?<br> We stayed one night.<br> We had sort of a little honeymoon.<br> And then last night<br> we stayed in Asheville.<br> - You stayed in Asheville last night?<br> - Yes. Last night.<br> Well.<br> And then we work up early this morning<br> to see David Wark.<br> And that's so exciting.<br> He paints mostly his conceptions<br> of the Confederate War.<br> It's extraordinary.<br> He's not schooled or trained.<br> If you get him talking<br> he goes off on these ideas,<br> and it's strange<br> because he sort of gets confused<br> with his own personal history<br> and that of the world.<br> Momma Peg does arts and crafts!<br> That's great.<br> And George told me that<br> you do woodworking, Mr. Johnsten.<br> Just call him Eugene. That's his name.<br> Eugene.<br> Come on. I want to show you your room.<br> I'll get that.<br> No. It's OK. I like to carry things,<br> it's good for me.<br> I bet you went to college, huh?<br> I want to go to college.<br> Here's you all's room,<br> it's the nursery<br> You'll love this. Paw made that cradle.<br> Johnny helped him.<br> Of course they need to paint it.<br> They made this?<br> Yeah. Here's the bathroom.<br> We're going to share that, 'cause<br> my bedroom's right through there.<br> So if you get lonely at night and you<br> want to talk you can just go like,<br> knock on the wall<br> and then I'll know it's you<br> and I can come out and we can talk.<br> Shouldn't I tell Pat about her thing?<br> I should replace it.<br> No. Don't worry about it.<br> She's got lots of them.<br> And I want her to like you.<br> And Madeleine, you keep calling her Pat.<br> Her name's Peg.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> I'll let you alone right now.<br> OK.<br> I want to hear all about how you<br> and George met and everything.<br> Was it love at first sight?<br> Yeah.<br> Really?<br> Yeah. I saw him at the gallery<br> and a week later we were married.<br> I love that.<br> It's so...<br> fuckin' cool,<br> Madeleine.<br> Can I help you unpack?<br> There you are.<br> We thought we'd lost you, George.<br> Look at you! You just light up a room.<br> Hey, man.<br> Hi.<br> Where you going?<br> I'm late.<br> Some of us do real work, you know.<br> Where's Madeleine?<br> Sit down, it's breakfast!<br> Hi. If you go to the mall today get me<br> the Cliffnotes for "Huckleberry Finn".<br> Let's go to the mall.<br> I love that book. It's my favorite.<br> Don't you love it?<br> No. I'm getting the Cliffnotes.<br> It's for his GED.<br> He didn't graduate high school.<br> We just loved each<br> other too much to wait.<br> - Ashley! Do you ever stop it?<br> - No.<br> See you later.<br> How you getting to work?<br> Norman's giving me a ride.<br> If he ever fuckin' gets here!<br> Let's go to the mall now. Let's do.<br> You'll love the mall.<br> It's got like a thousand fountains<br> and it's got this fudge factory!<br> And it's got a Nike store,<br> and a Barnes and Noble's,<br> and I can show you Aladdin's Castle<br> which is this arcade where<br> I first saw Johnny.<br> And there's Joanne's Nuthouse which is<br> where you get nuts and almonds.<br> Hey guys,<br> Madeleine wants to go to the mall!<br> Johnny Johnsten! Johnny Johnsten!<br> Johnny Johnsten! Johnny Johnsten!<br> Goddamn it!<br> Who's got their Panther pride?<br> Count down, boys.<br> Johnny, 200 more days. Panther pride!<br> Panther!

You're in love.<br> Yes, I'm in love now.<br> His name is Keith.<br> Why don't you ever bring him<br> around here?<br> No. He's a professional football player.<br> Shut up! What position?<br> Fullback.<br> I worked with this one guy.<br> He liked to go deer hunting.<br> He got a tic stuck on his anus.<br> He thought it was a hemorrhoid.<br> He kept on putting Preparation H<br> on it for week,<br> made it all supple.<br> He had his wife look at it<br> and she screamed,<br> Oh my God, it's a tic.<br> He pulled it off and stomped it<br> and it wouldn't even crush<br> because the Preparation H<br> made it so soft.<br> I don't know what love is, dude.<br> Man, my neighbors<br> are just driving me up the wall.<br> And they're in love.<br> They're technically in love,<br> but they're fighting over<br> a fuckin' goddamn mini-dish.<br> Get a mini-dish, is all I'm saying!<br> Just get a goddamn mini-dish.<br> This is the best fuckin' job I ever had.<br> Shut the fuck up.<br> I tell you what though,<br> you should come over to the house, man.<br> I got that Superbowl on tape.<br> I been watching it like every other day.<br> I always feel like they're going to win,<br> you know,<br> if I watch it on tape I fell like<br> they're going to pull it out.<br> But they never do. They never do.<br> Let's do it now.<br> Here?<br> Yeah! Don't you like 'Cinnamon Fizz'?<br> We can play beauty parlor.<br> Why hello, Miss Madeleine.<br> You called about...<br> 'Cinnamon Fizz'.<br> Don't you just love the way that sounds?<br> I suddenly have the urge to drink this.<br> Oh, that could be hormonal. Pica.<br> Do you feel like you want to eat dirt?<br> Or clay, as well?<br> NO! Yuck! What do you think I am?<br> Clay.<br> No. Yuck.<br> What'd you say that was-pica?<br> Yeah. You might need iron, or something.<br> Do you take supplements?<br> No.<br> I bet that's why George married you.<br> Why? What's wrong?<br> Nothing. The head's just on my nerves.<br> I'm fine.<br> I'm fine.<br> I'm fine.<br> What are you going to name it?<br> Junebug.<br> I mean, his real name will be Johnny<br> but we'll call him Junebug.<br> And if it's a little girl<br> we'll christen her Junebug Johnsten.<br> Can't you see a little baby<br> named Junebug?<br> So you don't know what you're having?<br> A baby.<br> No, I meant a boy or a girl?<br> Oh that.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't want to know.<br> I want to be surprised.<br> I don't care, so long as it's healthy<br> and it looks like Johnny.<br> What does he want?<br> I don't know<br> if he wants a baby right now.<br> But I know just as soon as he sees it<br> he's going to fall in love.<br> He's just going through a phase.<br> I read in one of my books that<br> that can happen.<br> How long has he been like that?<br> Two years.<br> But I know as soon as he sees that baby<br> he's going to snap out of it.<br> I think. Yep.<br> What do you think?<br> I don't know him.<br> Gosh, I wish that<br> I could grow my nails out like this.<br> I'm always biting on mine.<br> I do too. But these are wrapped.<br> You are kidding me! These are fake?<br> Yeah. I used to bite my own ones<br> right down to the quick.<br> George doesn't even know.<br> I even bite my toenails.<br> You do not! I do too!<br> I didn't think anybody else<br> in the world did that!<br> Ashley, what are you doing to her?<br> Cinnamon Fizz. Do you like it?<br> It's way past your nap time, Ashley.<br> You know what the doctor said. Come on.<br> I am not finished with her yet.<br> She's a grown-up.<br> She can finish her own fingernails.<br> Let me have that please.<br> I don't want that on my carpet. Go on.<br> Can I bum one of those?<br> For later.<br> Tah. Don't tell George.<br> How was your day?!<br> When's dinner?<br> Oh God. Don't stop. Don't stop.<br> Don't stop there. Do what you do...<br> I'm serious.<br> Oh hey. Don't talk to me 'cause<br> I'm working out. Did you not go?<br> No!<br> The Camaro still tore up?<br> Can't you fix it?<br> George wanted to take us<br> to a fancy dinner tonight<br> after the shower<br> but we got the church thing.<br> Hey, why don't you ask George?<br> He could help you fix it.<br> When did he call there?<br> This morning.<br> It was his sister who's a lawyer.<br> Did you know that he had a sister<br> who's also a lawyer?<br> What, a real lawyer?<br> - I don't know. Maybe.<br> - Fuck.<br> She's definitely negotiating something<br> with somebody in New York.<br> Okay. What gallery?<br> It sounds like it could be Mark Lane.<br> Right, of course.<br> She thinks because they're in New York...<br> Yeah. She's influenced<br> by their highfalutin talking.<br> Wait. Did she sign anything?<br> I have no idea. I mean, probably not.<br> I doubt it. I highly doubt it.<br> OK. No, I can handle this.<br> I can deal with this.<br> Okay. Are you having fun?<br> It's fine. You know what? I got to go.<br> - You don't want me to call?<br> - Okay, darling. Bye.<br> Okay.

Isn't she pretty?<br> That's my little tuxedo-<br> - Did you do that?<br> - I did.<br> You are so good!<br> You can make anything, Miss Peg.<br> Do you have children?<br> No.<br> The reason people like meerkats...<br> you got 2 eyes looking right at you.<br> That makes them look kind<br> of humanoid to you.<br> The meerkat approaching you<br> creates a hostile defense<br> until it can smell you.<br> Ashley? Ashley!<br> ...help in reproducing individuals<br> where they're young.<br> Only the offspring of the alpha female<br> are allowed to live.<br> The others, if they happen<br> to get impregnated accidentally,<br> while the alpha female is pregnant<br> sometimes try to sneak their young<br> in with a newborn of the alpha female.<br> They live in social groups<br> of which non-reproducing individuals<br> contribute to the welfare of the...<br> Look at these.

Go on.<br> Forget it. Fuck it. Go on.<br> God loves you just the way you are<br> but he loves you too much<br> to let you stay that way.<br> Lucille.<br> These people got the wrong house.<br> We're having a little thing for Ashley.<br> Her friends. Kind of last minute.<br> We want that woman been courting<br> my brother's pictures. Is she here?<br> Hi Mrs. Speas! Hi.<br> We're having my baby shower.<br> You should come on in.<br> Who you got with you?<br> Madeleine?!<br> God.<br> You all come on in. Sure. Come on in.<br> I'm Madeleine.<br> I've been trying to call you all day.<br> How did you find us?<br> A roomful of ladies.<br> Did you do this for me?<br> Of course.<br> - That's my sister.<br> - How do you do?<br> Oh, I think it's that retarded<br> artist Madeleine knows.<br> I'm telling you<br> they're not the right gallery for him.<br> They won't take care of him.<br> He sounds pretty good on the phone.<br> Course he never came himself.<br> Right. That's why I came down here,<br> because I love your brother's work,<br> ma'am. I love it.<br> They said you came down here<br> because your husband lives here.<br> Who said that?<br> The New York people.<br> No - it's just a coincidence.<br> They said you was small potatoes.<br> That's right.<br> Ma'am, honestly,<br> - I can make your brother money.<br> - Dear Jesus...<br> If that's what you want.<br> Glory be to you, Lord,<br> I want to say thank you for this day<br> and for the blessings of this party<br> and for my friends<br> and all my presents-which I love.<br> And for the gift of life<br> growing inside me.<br> Help me to be a good Christian mother,<br> and to raise the child to praise<br> your name, Jesus.

Alright?<br> Lord, I just thank you<br> for this fellowship tonight<br> and for the safe return<br> of George to his home flock.<br> I pray, Lord, that you would bless<br> his marriage to Madeleine.<br> Or God that it would be<br> a spirit filled union.<br> That they would see the impermanence<br> of this world.<br> And pray, Lord God that<br> you would banish the Devil<br> and all evil-doers from their door,<br> no matter where they are<br> in the kingdom, Lord.<br> Praise you Jesus.<br> Amen.<br> You ready for that song?<br> Uh oh.<br> Come on.<br> Kind of a big room.<br> It's good. Come on.<br> Alright everybody,<br> you all knew that we had a treat<br> when you heard George Johnsten<br> was back in town.<br> Now don't tell a lie.<br> Who of you all thought that<br> he was going to get out of here<br> without giving us a hymn?<br> This wasn't my idea.<br> Now, I know you're a little rusty,<br> so I want to get Eddy McGee.<br> Come on,<br> Eddy and bring your son up here.<br> Come on up here and help this man out.<br> You remember the number don't you?<br> I think I need the book.<br> - It's 283.<br> - Thank you.<br> This one here is, he's 16.<br> His voice just broke. He's singing bass.<br> Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,<br> Calling for you and for me;<br> See, on the portals<br> He's waiting and watching,<br> Watching for you and for me.<br> Come home, come home,<br> Ye who are weary come home;<br> Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,<br> Calling O sinner<br> come home.<br> Oh for the wonderful love<br> He has promised,<br> Promised for you and for me,<br> Tho' we have sinned<br> He has mercy and pardon,<br> Pardon for you and for me.<br> Come home, come home,<br> Come home, come home,<br> Ye who are weary come home;<br> Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,<br> Calling oh sinner<br> come home.<br> I don't think I'd ever move back<br> to Baltimore.<br> This is just so much more peaceful.<br> Yeah, I hear you.<br> Momma Peg made it.<br> She makes most of my maternity stuff.<br> It's so beautiful. Such lovely work.<br> It's not much,<br> but I'm kind of proud of it.<br> You sew?<br> Oh no, I can't do anything<br> with my hands.<br> You don't have to. You're smart.<br> George knew that when he married you?<br> Hey. Why doesn't Madeleine help you<br> with you report?<br> She'd be good at it.<br> It wouldn't take much.<br> You all could do it tonight.<br> Couldn't you? Please.<br> Sure, I can help you.<br> You all ready to skedaddle?<br> I bet you get an A.<br> Where did you get that?<br> Hey Peter, we're going to go home.<br> Come on!<br> You need an engraved invitation or what?<br> You coming to bed?<br> Not now. I'm looking for something.<br> My Phillips-head.<br> Peg?<br> Peg?<br> No, it's me Ashley.<br> There's some 'Zingers'<br> on the bottom shelf.<br> Oh, I'm just getting a carrot.<br> Dolly would be a nice name.<br> I turned the light on and everything.<br> Are you going to go?<br> She's really, really smart<br> and she wants to help you.<br> I'll wait up for you, OK?<br> He's ready for you.<br> OK.<br> You look so pretty.<br> You smell good too.<br> All baby powder and shampoo-y.<br> I'm going to bed.<br> OK.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Thank you.<br> - OK.<br> So what do we do?<br> Write a paper.<br> They don't believe you read it unless<br> you can write a paper on it.<br> So... a paper.<br> Have you read any of it?<br> Yeah. I looked through it.<br> Did you think it was funny?<br> No. I thought it was long.<br> OK.<br> What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What?<br> You smell like George.<br> OK.<br> How about I help you<br> with some of the themes?<br> OK, how about you help me<br> with some of the themes.<br> OK?<br> OK.<br> How about escape?<br> Huck, and Jim,<br> are constantly managing to<br> just wriggle out<br> of one situation before...<br> Who's Jim?<br> The black man. The slave.<br> Traveling down the Mississippi.<br> Oh, yeah. Jim.<br> OK.<br> Well, their relationship is a...<br> Well, it's Huck's...<br> gradual sort of...<br> love affair with this slave<br> is the major theme...<br> Wait. They fall in love with each other?<br> No, not love affair like that<br> I don't think you're talking<br> about the right book.<br> I'm not talking about a romance.<br> Two people can love each other<br> and it's not really...<br> It's more...<br> It's more<br> respect.<br> Huck comes to see this slave<br> as a real person.<br> A whole person. Like himself.<br> And that's a new insight.<br> This is what<br> you'd call a picaresque novel.<br> That's good word to use.<br> And it means, usually,<br> a main character that's traveling like<br> 'Don Quixote', or 'Candide'.<br> You think I'm a complete idiot,<br> don't you?<br> No. God no.<br> I just don't know how much<br> of this book you've read.<br> And it's a pity,<br> because it's a great book.<br> And it is really funny.<br> Doesn't this boy's dad try to kill him?<br> Yeah.<br> That's not funny.<br> You're doing this to make fun of me.<br> No, I'm not. I'm trying to help you.<br> Let's just read the first chapter.<br> It actually lays out<br> a lot of the themes.<br> Are you listening to me? Will you do it?<br> What?<br> Just read the first chapter.<br> I don't have to. That's why I got this.<br> You're right. This thing it tells you<br> everything I could have told you.<br> I don't even know what<br> I'm doing here. Do you?<br> It's been hard, lately, around here.<br> What do you mean?<br> Just with everything. You know?<br> Oh. Did you not want to have children?<br> I would have gone to Washington D.C.<br> In 12th Grade.<br> You know?<br> Except for her.<br> She kept looking at me all junior year.<br> And I couldn't concentrate.<br> That fucked me up.<br> So, when is this due?<br> Any fucking time now!<br> No, I meant the paper.<br> Tell me what you're doing here.<br> What do you mean?<br> Tell me what you<br> and George are doing here?<br> - Johnny.<br> - Fuck you.<br> I don't need George sailing in here<br> all-help out poor Johnny, some shit.<br> No. None of us need shit from you.<br> Okay?<br> Johnny.<br> And fuck Huck Finn! Fuck!<br> Johnny, stop! Stop. Oh God. Sorry.<br> Darling, I'm trying to help you.<br> I wasn't laughing at you.<br> I wasn't laughing at you.<br> We didn't come here to upset you. Okay?<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK?<br> Just be still. Sorry.<br> There.<br> What are you doing?<br> Hey.<br> Oh shit. I'm sorry. Oh my god, Johnny,<br> it's so sweet almost. I'm sorry.<br> What, you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?<br> Ever since you got here<br> you've been playing me, man.<br> Don't tell me<br> you didn't mean anything by it.<br> I know it when I see it.<br> I'm not stupid! I'm not an idiot!<br> Johnny, you completely misunderstood me.<br> I was helping you. Sweetheart, listen...<br> Oh shut up! You bitch! Fuck!<br> Where the hell you think<br> George come from anyway?<br> He's no better than us!<br> - He doesn't think-<br> - And neither are you. Alright?<br> Flaunting around!<br> We all see it!<br> We're not stupid.<br> I don't know what George<br> isn't giving you,<br> but you want something.<br> Oh he taught me...<br> to love him.<br> He promised to laugh.<br> He called me his blossom.<br> He called me his flower.<br> A blossom to cheer him<br> though life's weary hour.<br> But now he has gone and left me alone.<br> The wildflowers to weep<br> and the wild birds...<br> Where would I be if I was a screwdriver?<br> You may be seated.<br> You all, when was the last time<br> you were so filled up<br> with the Holy Spirit<br> that people mocked you?<br> And said, That person must be drunk.<br> That person must be filled<br> with new wine.<br> I think I have to confess that<br> that time for me may have been never.<br> Well, I don't like that she was<br> "just helping him out".<br> I don't think anyone<br> ever taught her how to do.<br> Do what?<br> Do right. Don't be dumb.<br> I like her.<br> She means well.<br> George likes her.<br> She doesn't know George.<br> She loves him.<br> What do they have in common?<br> He loves her.<br> And then she's up all hours with Johnny?<br> I don't like it.<br> I want you to say something to her.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> Don't be stupid.<br> But just find out if she<br> and George are happy.<br> And tell her Johnny and Ashley<br> are real happy.<br> We don't need some stranger<br> coming in here messing things up.<br> She ain't a stranger. She's family.<br> She's still strange.<br> She's older. She's too pretty.<br> And she's too smart<br> and that's a deadly combination.<br> Hi.<br> Speak of the devil.<br> So, how was church? Where's George?<br> Gas.<br> He left again?<br> Eugene says that you<br> and Johnny stayed up late last night.<br> Yeah. I was helping with his paper.<br> Kind of.<br> Talking. I guess that's the way<br> you do things in Chicago?<br> What? Say up late?<br> Yeah. Talking.<br> Remember when we used<br> to go honkytonking at the Grange?<br> Be quiet, Eugene.<br> We stayed up till all hours.<br> Eugene, nobody's listening to you.<br> Eugene, sit up straight.<br> And remember what I said.<br> She's a very strong personality,<br> isn't she?<br> That's just her way.<br> She's not like that inside.<br> She hides herself.<br> Like most.<br> What are you looking for?<br> Oh, nothing.<br> My screwdriver, I guess. It's nothing.<br> How long<br> have you been doing woodworking for?<br> I'd love to see your...<br> Hey!<br> Hey! You all! I think this is it!<br> Hi. They're getting really close.<br> I knew I should have washed my hair<br> this morning.<br> - What can I do?<br> - Hey, Ashley.<br> Could you cut my toenails?<br> - Are you sure this is it?<br> - Sure.<br> Let me get my scissors.<br> They been coming all morning,<br> I've been timing them.<br> They're really close. Johnny?!<br> Where you going?<br> Bring the car up front.<br> Don't just stand there. Go get the car.<br> Hey, do you have<br> any of that nail polish left?<br> I know I have clippers.<br> I'm just looking!<br> What's going on?<br> Your baby that's all. Where you been?<br> It's OK. Relax, honey.<br> We got plenty of time.<br> - What do you want me to do?<br> - Why don't you got get the car.<br> Your daddy's got it.<br> Okay. I need my little suitcase it's...<br> No, don't tell me that.<br> I want to do something important.<br> Call the doctor?<br> Lord have mercy!<br> What do you think I'm doing?<br> The line is busy.<br> Go get her little suitcase!<br> How can every line<br> at the hospital be busy?<br> What if we had an emergency?<br> Breathe.<br> Hey, it's alright. It's fun. It's fun.<br> Just think after all this<br> I get to take home a baby, too.<br> Damn it to hell!<br> - It's better than Christmas!<br> - Come on, let's go.<br> Come on, get up.<br> I got it!<br> Thank you. Could you go grab my flower<br> flops please.<br> - Where are they?<br> - They're in there.<br> I know. But where?<br> By my side of the bed.<br> What do they look like?<br> - Shoes!<br> - Brown!<br> I'm sorry. You stay here.<br> When George gets home tell him to come<br> on to the hospital. He'll be a help.<br> OK.<br> Pop the trunk!<br> I'm trying.<br> We'll keep you posted.

You'll get your one of<br> your own soon enough.<br> - Hello?<br> - Bernadette! Oh, thank God!<br> Did Jane ever get through to you?<br> We've been trying to call.<br> I really don't want<br> to be the one to tell you this.<br> What?<br> David Wark isn't going with us.<br> No! What? Why?<br> His lawyer or his sister,<br> called yesterday<br> and said they want to show<br> in New York<br> so they're signing with Mark Lane.<br> Oh shit.<br> I just saw them.<br> He was here. He ate cake.<br> He went home with all the balloons.<br> He said he enjoyed the party.<br> Did you throw him a party?<br> No, it was... nevermind.<br> What else did they say?<br> I don't know what happened.<br> They offered them something he wanted.<br> I don't know what it was.<br> You'll have to talk to Tommy.<br> Tommy spoke to her...<br> No. No. Don't let anyone call him.<br> I'm going to go there.<br> I'll go back there and I'll see him.<br> He likes me. We have a thing.<br> I'm just going to tell him<br> how much I love him and...<br> We're not going to lose him.<br> We're not going to lose him. So, okay?<br> Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - Love you.<br> - Love you too. Bye.<br> Bye.<br> There's got to be a cigarette<br> in this house.<br> Are you allergic to any medications?<br> No.<br> Are you taking any medications?<br> No.<br> How many children do you have?<br> Where you been? Timbuktu?<br> Sir, I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here<br> This is a non-smoking facility.<br> Hey, wait a second. Hey, come back.<br> Can I get you anything?<br> My husband just walked out of the room.<br> He went to smoke a cigarette.<br> He'll be back.<br> We have to go.<br> We have to go to Pine Mountain.<br> What? Why?<br> - Wark's signing with Lane Gallery.<br> - Are you smoking?!<br> No! Come on, give me the keys. Hurry.<br> I'll drive.<br> No. I'll drive. You're too slow.<br> Oh and Ashley's gone into labor.<br> They've all gone to the hospital.<br> What?<br> What?<br> It means something.<br> What?<br> Family.<br> Can I drop you off, George? Please.<br> I don't understand why you don't know<br> how much this means to me.<br> Do you want me to lose him?<br> Because I will.<br> And they won't take care of him.<br> You know that.<br> And actually, he's why we're here<br> in the first place.<br> We wouldn't be here<br> if it wasn't for him.<br> I know.<br> You need to be there, I agree with that,<br> but I just don't think it's my place.<br> I think it is.<br> OK.<br> I'll leave you when<br> we're closer to him now.<br> I'll leave you there<br> and go back to the hospital.<br> Really?<br> Are you sure?<br> If that's what you want.<br> If that's what you think is right.<br> According to my chart<br> and according to everything,<br> you've done extremely well...<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> It's as if I have this personal,<br> spiritual connection to what you do.<br> You know? Ever since I was a child,<br> I've been drawn<br> to things from the South.<br> It's as I recognize something.<br> It's as if ever painting is<br> like my child.<br> My own child.<br> It's not just a commodity.<br> These other dealers,<br> they would just treat you<br> like a commodity<br> and they would never understand<br> your vision and your mission.<br> I believe, Mr. Wark,<br> I love your work more<br> than Mark Lane does.<br> I'm a collaborator with God.<br> This life here is<br> just a saddening well of tears.<br> I got no great wish to tarry here.<br> And I'm ready to ascend anytime.<br> But my job here is<br> to make the invisible visible.<br> I want to help you.<br> I want to give you the opportunity<br> to do just that. I can.<br> There. Right there, that's<br> my Niggerland Uprising series.<br> Poor old nigger slaves<br> arising up against their evil oppressors.<br> I never could draw a colored face.<br> I've never known one personally.<br> I just look in a mirror<br> and put my own in there.<br> Or... somebody I like.<br> There's a surprise in there.<br> Look at them faces.<br> George. Hubby.<br> His face stuck with me<br> and I put him in a painting.<br> I want you to tell him that he's helping<br> me get my message to the world.<br> You could reach the whole of<br> Europe with me. Think about that.<br> Sissy says New York.<br> Okay, well, if New York is the obstacle<br> I can absolutely guarantee you that<br> we would show in New York.<br> We work with Mimi Steinberg there...<br> - Jew?<br> - Love you.<br> What?<br> Jewess? That lady?<br> That wouldn't be what we want'n to do.<br> Mark Lane is Jewish.<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> I would be your representative.<br> Personally.<br> To the whole world<br> you would only deal with me.<br> Whatever you want,<br> I would get it for you.<br> A Barker's Fruit Basket.<br> You get me one of those.<br> I had one when I was a kid.<br> I don't know<br> if they still make them or not.<br> You get that and the deal is yours.<br> That's all you want?<br> You promise to join me<br> with God's angels in my quest,<br> you done that.<br> And you believe in Jesus Christ<br> as your personal savior.<br> I believe in you.<br> I look in your eyes<br> and I view your soul,<br> clear as spring water.<br> I can see that you're good.<br> And that you strive for righteousness.<br> So you get me a<br> big old Barker's Fruit basket<br> with a lot of navel oranges<br> in it and the deal's yours.<br> I make my mark on your paper.<br> Right here it is.<br> Where?<br> There.<br> Finished.<br> Thank you.<br> Didn't no one say<br> them people were Jews to me.<br> George is staying.<br> George, darling,<br> why don't you leave your cellphone on?<br> I've been trying to reach you.<br> I got him back.<br> And you can't believe,<br> it's the most bizarre thing,<br> all he wanted was a fruit basket.<br> Well, that's good for you.<br> I know.<br> Have you heard of a Barker's basket?<br> Listen, we lost him.<br> George, what happened?<br> She didn't want the fetal monitor<br> and it came fast.<br> I have to come to the hospital.<br> You could have.<br> What?<br> There's nothing to do.<br> Will you come get me?<br> No. I'm going to stay with Ashley.<br> I guess you should,<br> you could take a cab.<br> Bluebird Cab.<br> I'm going to get back to her now.<br> You got the acid reflux?<br> Don't you want some?<br> OK.<br> It's funny how you're gone all the time<br> but you always here when I need you.<br> Isn't that funny?<br> Is Madeleine alright?<br> She's on her way home.<br> To Chicago?<br> No, no.

He was perfect.<br> He was.<br> He was blue.<br> You'll come back and see me tomorrow,<br> won't you?<br> And can you all stay for the service?<br> We want to and I have to figure out...<br> I know.<br> You got stuff you<br> got to get back to. I know.<br> But you'll be there in spirit.<br> I will.<br> I know.<br> I don't understand, but<br> you make me feel better<br> about things than anybody else.<br> And you don't even do anything!<br> I love you.<br> I'm so happy that you<br> and Madeleine are my family.<br> You too.<br> Okay.<br> Bye.<br> Hey, send her my love. Okay?<br> Yeah.<br> Thank you so much.<br> I'm sorry to get you out of bed.<br> Oh... well.<br> I'll call you soon. I'm really happy.<br> Well.<br> I'm just so sorry<br> for your family's loss.<br> Piece of shit.<br> I'm gonna sell it.<br> George?<br> I'm sorry.<br> We're going home tomorrow.<br> We are? But I haven't seen Ashley.<br> I took care of it.<br> You don't want to tell her<br> why I didn't go...<br> There's nothing to do. So we're going.<br> Darling, what happened?<br> Don't touch it.<br> George?<br> Mayo?<br> What?<br> You want mayonnaise on these?<br> No, I don't...<br> does George eat mayonnaise?<br> Lord yes. He could eat it with a spoon!<br> - You'll tell Ashley that I...<br> - Sure.<br> And I promise I'll write.<br> I got it.<br> She'll like that.<br> But don't worry about Ashley.<br> She's a firecracker.<br> You looking forward to the drive?<br> You and George play car games?<br> You know like name the presidents<br> and count billboards and such as that.<br> We used to love that.<br> Watch out though, he's a cheat.<br> Where's George?<br> You need any help?<br> All done.<br> You got another one of those?<br> Don't tell Madeleine.<br> I guess she's gonna stay around.<br> I hope so.<br> I guess she'll find out all my faults,<br> sooner or later.<br> Well...<br> She's got lovely hands.<br> I'll give her that.<br> But you don't have a thing wrong<br> with you George...<br> not a thing.<br> You OK?<br> Oh! Wait a second.<br> Look what I found.<br> Hey.<br> I just remembered<br> I woke up this morning<br> and I rolled over<br> and I saw it lying under there,<br> but I was half asleep,<br> so I was just sitting in the kitchen<br> and I remembered.<br> So strange.
