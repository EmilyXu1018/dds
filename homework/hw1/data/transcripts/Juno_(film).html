                        It started with a chair.<br> I've wanted this for a really long time.<br> I know.<br> Wizard.<br> Jeez Banana, shut your freakin' gob OK?<br> This is the most magnificent discarded<br> living room set Ive ever seen.<br> Well, well, if it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog.<br> Back for another test?<br> I think the first one was defective,<br> The plus sign looks more like a division symbol,<br> so I remain unconvinced.<br> Third test today, Momma Bear,<br> your eggo's preggo, no doubt about it.<br> It's really easy to tell, is your<br> nipples real brown?<br> Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms,<br> knocked you up twice.<br> Silencio, old man. Look, I just drank<br> my weight in SunnyD and I gotta go pronto.<br> Well, you know where the lavatory is.<br> Pay for that pee stick when you're done.<br> Don't think it's yours just 'cause<br> you marked it with your urine.<br> What's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle:<br> Minus or plus?<br> I don't know, it's not seasoned yet.<br> I'll take some of these.<br> There it is.<br> The little pink plus sign is so unholy.<br> That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch, this is<br> one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet.<br> Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.<br> I'm a suicide risk.<br> Juno?<br> No, it's Morgan Freeman, do you have any<br> bones that need collecting?<br> Only the one in my pants.<br> I'm pregnant.<br> What? Honest to blog?<br> Yeah, it's Bleeker's.<br> It's probably just a food baby,<br> did you have a big lunch?<br> This is not a food baby, I've taken three<br> pregnancy tests and I am fo' shiz up the spout.<br> How did you even generate enough pee for<br> three pregnancy tests? That's amazing.<br> I don't know, I drank like ten tons of SunnyD.<br> I'm telling you I'm pregnant and<br> you're acting shockingly cavalier.<br> Is this for real?<br> Like for real for real?<br> Unfortunately yes.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!<br> That was kind of the emotion that I was<br> searching for on the first take.<br> Are you going to Havenbrook or Women Now?<br> You need a note from your parents for Havenbrook.<br> Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to go to Women Now,<br> just 'cause they help out women now.<br> Do you want me to call for you?<br> Because I called for Becky last year.<br> No, I can call myself. Oh, but I do need your help<br> with something, it's like critically important.<br> You know, heavy lifting can really only<br> help you at this point.<br> Seriously.<br> So, you were bored? That's how<br> this blessed miracle came to be?<br> No, the act was premeditated. I mean, the sex,<br> not the whole "let's get pregnant" thing.<br> So, when did you decide that you were<br> gonna do Bleeker?<br> I don't know.<br> A year ago in Spanish class.<br> You love him.<br> It's actually really complicated, OK?<br> And I don't feel like talking about it<br> in my fragile state.<br> So what was it like?<br> Humping Bleek's bony bod?<br> Magnificent.<br> Hey, Bleek.<br> Wicked tiger.<br> It looks proud.<br> I swiped it from Ms. Rancick's lawn.<br> Wow, your shorts are like<br> especially gold today.<br> My mom uses color-safe bleach.<br> Go Carole.<br> I'll tell her.<br> When I see them all running like that,<br> with their things bouncing around in their shorts,<br> I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to,<br> all I see is pork swords.<br> I'm supposed to be running.<br> So guess what.<br> What? I don't know.<br> I'm pregnant.<br> What should we do?<br> Oh, you know, I was thinking I'd just nip it<br> in the bud before it gets worse.<br> Because they were talking about it in health class,<br> how pregnancy can often lead to an infant.<br> Typically, yeah, yeah.<br> That's what happens when<br> our moms and teachers get pregnant.<br> So, you're cool with that then?<br> Yeah, yeah, wizard. You know,<br> do whatever you think you should do, you know?<br> Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you,<br> I know it wasn't your idea.<br> Whose idea was it?<br> I'll see you at school , alright?<br> Whose idea was it?<br> Hey, your book fell apart.<br> Right.<br> It must have looked at your face.<br> The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo<br> secretly wants me.<br> Jocks like him<br> always want freaky girls.<br> Girls with horn-rimmed glasses and vegan<br> footwear and Goth makeup.<br> Girls who play the cello and read McSweeney's<br> and want to be childrens librarians when they grow up.<br> Oh yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.<br> They just wont admit it, because theyre<br> supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders you know,<br> Like Leah, who incidentally is into teachers.<br> Me too, I love Woody Allen!<br> Alright people.<br> We're doing chromatography lab today,<br> so find your partners and break into groups of four.<br> Well, there's nothing like experimenting.<br> I did the prep questions for this lab last night,<br> so you can just copy my answers if you want.<br> I couldnt copy your work.<br> You copy my work every week.<br> True, I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, aren't I?<br> No, no, I don't mind.<br> I think you definitely bring something to the table.<br> Charisma.<br> Who's ready for some chromamagnificence?<br> I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't<br> really look at bright lights today.<br> Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary<br> and lie down. You never listen.<br> No, Josh, because I don't take orders.<br> Not from you and not from any man.<br> You know, you've been acting like this ever since<br> I got back from visiting my brother in Mankato.<br> I already told you, nothing happened.<br> Well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.<br> Juno, do you want to plug in the Bunsen burner?<br> It's my pleasure.<br> Im going to the infirmary.<br> Good. Call me when you get off the rag.<br> Fine, call me when you learn how to love someone,<br> instead of cheating at your brother's college,<br> Just because you've had four Smirnoff Ices and<br> a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boones!<br> Good, Amanda, I'll be sure to do that,<br> I'll make a note of it.<br> I've actually heard that the Snow Peak Peach flavor<br> is the best flavor of Boone's.<br> Isn't that right, Bleek?<br> Oprimo numero dos.<br> Yeah, I'm just calling to<br> procure a hasty abortion.<br> What?<br> Can you just hold on for a second,<br> I'm on my hamburger phone.<br> Okay, now I can,<br> Yeah, it's really awkward to talk on.<br> Yeah, I need an abortion.<br> Sixteen.<br> I'm gonna say it's been about two months and<br> four days since the sex,<br> Mind you, that's just like a guestimation.<br> Sorry, how long have I been what?<br> Oh, I hate it when adults use the term<br> "sexually active".<br> What does it even mean?<br> Can I deactivate someday, or is this a<br> permanent state of being?<br> I guess Bleeker went live that night we did it,<br> I guess thats why he got that look on his face.<br> You should have seen this octopus furnace at work.<br> I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get into the thing.<br> My dad used to be in the Army, but<br> now hes just your average HVAC specialist.<br> He and my mom got divorced when I was five,<br> She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona<br> with her new husband and three replacement kids.<br> Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus<br> every Valentines Day.<br> And Im like, Thanks a heap, Coyote Ugly. This<br> cactus-gram stings even worse than your abandonment.<br> Thats my stepmom, Bren,<br> she's completely obsessed with dogs.<br> Owns a nail salon and always smells<br> like methylmethacrylate.<br> So Juno, how was your little maneuver last night?<br> Which maneuver, sir? The one where I moved<br> an entire living room set from one lawn to the other,<br> or the one where I downed a sixty-four<br> ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?<br> Juno, did you by any chance barf in my urn?<br> Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door,<br> the one I got up in Stillwater?<br> There was some blue shit,<br> I mean, gunk, stuff in there this morning.<br> I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.<br> I mean, maybe L.B. did it.<br> Liberty Bell, if you put one more Baco on that potato,<br> Im gonna kick your little monkey butt.<br> All babies want to get borned!<br> All babies want to get borned!<br> All babies want to get borned!<br> Hey Su-Chin.<br> Hi, Juno.<br> How are you?<br> You know, pretty solid.<br> So did you write that paper for Worth's class yet?<br> No, not yet.<br> I tried to work on it a little last night,<br> but Im having trouble concentrating.<br> I'll sell you some of my Adderall.<br> No thanks, I'm off pills.<br> That's a wise choice 'cause I knew this girl,<br> she had this crazy freakout.<br> She took too many behavioral meds at once and she<br> ripped off her clothes<br> and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall like,<br> Blaaaaah! Im a kraken from the sea!<br> I heard that was you.<br> It was good seeing you, Su-Chin.<br> Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know?<br> It can feel pain,<br> And it has fingernails.<br> Fingernails? Really?<br> Welcome to Women Now, where<br> women are trusted friends.<br> Please put your hands where I can see them<br> and surrender any bombs.<br> Hey, Im here for the big show.<br> Your name, please?<br> Juno MacGuff.<br> She thinks Im using a fake name.<br> Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.<br> I need you to fill these out, both sides.<br> We need to know about every score and every sore.<br> Would you like a free condom?<br> Theyre boysenberry.<br> No, Im off sex.<br> My boyfriend uses them every time we have intercourse.<br> They make his jocks smell like pie.<br> All babies want to get borned!<br> All babies want to get borned!<br> God appreciates your miracle!<br> Dude, what are you doing here?<br> I'm supposed to come get you at four.<br> I couldnt do it, Leah!<br> It smelled like a dentist office in there,<br> And there were these horrible magazines<br> with water stains.<br> And then the friggin' receptionist is trying to give me<br> these condoms that looked like grape suckers,<br> and just babbling away about<br> her friggin' boyfriends pie balls.<br> Yum!<br> And Su-Chin was there, and she was like,<br> "Oh hi! Babies have fingernails."<br> Fingernails!<br> That's gruesome.<br> You think the baby can scratch your<br> vag on the way out?<br> Im staying pregnant, Leah.<br> Dude! You gotta keep your voice down, my mom is inside.<br> She doesnt know that were sexually active.<br> What does that even mean?<br> I've been thinking.<br> I was thinking that I could have this baby and<br> give it to someone who totally needs it.<br> You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or<br> a couple of nice lesbos.<br> But then youre gonna get huge and your<br> chest is gonna milktate.<br> - And you have to tell people that youre pregnant.<br> - But maybe theyll canonize me for being so selfless.<br> Maybe theyll totally shit and be really mad and not<br> let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.<br> I was going to go to<br> Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.<br> You should look at adoption ads,<br> I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.<br> They have ads for parents?<br> Yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." Right next to<br> terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment.<br> Its totally legit.<br> "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple<br> have found true love with each other."<br> "All thats missing is your bastard."<br> I want a parakeet.<br> Youre totally not even listening to me.<br> No, I heard you. I don't want to give the baby to a family<br> that describes themselves as "wholesome."<br> - Why?<br> - I want something a little more edgier.<br> - Okay, what did you have in mind exactly?<br> - I was thinking a graphic designer,<br> mid-thirties, with a cool Asian girlfriend who dresses<br> awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.<br> But I don't want to be too particular.<br> OK, how about this?<br> "Educated, successful couple seeking<br> infant to join our family of five."<br> "You will be compensated. Help us<br> complete the circle of love."<br> That sounds great.<br> They sound like a friggin' cult. Besides, they already<br> have three kids, they're greedy little bitches.<br> Oh, Juno! How about this one?<br> They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,<br> And they were beautiful even in black and white.<br> Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?<br> No, I dont think so.<br> You ran eight miles today, Puppy.<br> Im not hungry, oddly.<br> But its breakfast for supper.<br> It's your favorite, Paul.<br> Yeah.<br> Juno MacGuff called while you were out running today.<br> You know how I feel about her.<br> Youve mentioned it a couple times.<br> She is just ...<br> ... different.<br> Yeah.<br> I 'm not really sure how I'm gonna spit this out.<br> Hon, did you get expelled?<br> No. The school would most likely contact you<br> in the event of my expulsion.<br> Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.<br> Do you need a large amount of money?<br> Legal counsel?<br> No, Im not asking for anything.<br> Except for maybe mercy. Like, it would be<br> friggin' sweet if no one hit me.<br> What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit<br> someone with the Previa?<br> No.<br> Dude, I think it's best to just tell them.<br> I'm pregnant.<br> Oh, God.<br> But Im going to give it up for adoption.<br> I already found the perfect couple.<br> They're gonna pay for the<br> medical expenses and everything.<br> In thirty-odd weeks we can just pretend that this<br> never happened.<br> You're pregnant?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Im sorry.<br> And if it is any consolation,<br> I have heartburn thats<br> radiating down to my kneecaps<br> and I havent take a dump since Wednesday.<br> Morning!<br> I didnt even know you were sexually active!<br> Who is the kid?<br> The baby? I dont really know much about it.<br> It has fingernails, allegedly.<br> Nails? Really?<br> Yeah.<br> I mean, who is the father, Juno?<br> It's Paulie Bleeker.<br> Paulie Bleeker?<br> What?<br> I didnt think he had it in him!<br> I know, right?<br> Right, this is no laughing matter.<br> No, it's not.<br> And Paulie is actually great.<br> In chair.<br> You were thinking about adoption?<br> Yeah, theres this couple.<br> Theyve been trying to have a kid for five years.<br> We found them in the Penny Saver next to the<br> exotic birds.<br> They have a legitimate lawyer and I was<br> going to go meet with them next weekend.<br> Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do.<br> Probably tougher than you can understand right now.<br> I know ...<br> ... It's just that Im not ready to be a mom.<br> Damn skippy, youre not!<br> You dont even remember to give<br> Liberty Bell her breathing meds.<br> That was once! And she did not die, if you recall!<br> Honey, had you considered, you<br> know, the alternative?<br> No.<br> Well, youre a little Viking!<br> First things first,<br> we have to get you healthy.<br> You need prenatal vitamins,<br> Incidentally, they do incredible<br> things for your nails, so thats a plus.<br> Oh, and we need to schedule a doctors appointment.<br> Figure out where youre going to deliver.<br> Juno, I'm coming with you to meet this adoption people.<br> Youre just a kid. I dont want you to get<br> ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.<br> Thanks, Dad.<br> I thought you were the kind of girl<br> who knew when to say when.<br> I don't really know what kind of girl I am.<br> Tell it to me straight, Bren.<br> Do you think this is my fault?<br> I think kids get bored and have intercourse.<br> And I think Junebug was a dummy about it, Mac.<br> I am not ready to be a Pop-Pop.<br> Youre not going to be a Pop-Pop.<br> Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing<br> from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.<br> Did you see that coming when she sat us down here?<br> Yeah. But I was hoping she<br> was expelled or into hard drugs.<br> That was my first instinct too.<br> Or D.W.I. Anything but this.<br> And Im going to punch that Bleeker kid in<br> the weiner the next time I see him.<br> Mac, no.<br> You know it wasnt his idea.<br> Hi! Im Vanessa. You must be Juno<br> and Mr. MacGuff.<br> Vanessa.<br> It's Vanessa, right?<br> Thanks for having me and my<br> irresponsible child over to your house.<br> Oh no. Thank you.<br> Come on in.<br> Can I take your coat or your hat?<br> Oh, yeah, sure, thanks.<br> Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy.<br> Not like those people with fake woods in the background,<br> Honestly, who do they think they're fooling?<br> You found us in the Penny Saver?<br> Hi. Mark Loring. Im the husband.<br> - How you doing? Mac McGuff.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> Hi.<br> This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney.<br> Gerta Rauss.<br> Hi, pleased to meet you.<br> And this, of course, is Juno.<br> Like the city in Alaska.<br> No.<br> No?<br> Hon?<br> Shall we sit down and get to know one another?<br> I thought I'd get some drinks.<br> What would anyone like?<br> I have Pellegrino or Vitamin Water or orange juice.<br> A Makers Mark, please. Up.<br> Shes kidding.<br> Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor,<br> just one of her many genetic gifts.<br> I see.<br> So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?<br> Im a junior.<br> No, I mean in your pregnancy.<br> Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday to the doctor<br> and they said I was twelve weeks.<br> Oh, thats marvelous.<br> So youre into your second trimester?<br> Yeah, apparently.<br> Im due on May 4.<br> Great.<br> My girlfriends tell me the first couple<br> months are the hardest.<br> I didn't notice it at all.<br> Im more concerned about when they have to<br> put that elastic band in the front of my jeans.<br> I think pregnancy is beautiful.<br> Well, youre lucky its not you.<br> So, lets talk how were gonna do this...thing.<br> Well, don't I just have the thing?<br> Squeeze it on out and hand it over?<br> Mark and Vanessa are willing to<br> negotiate an open adoption.<br> What does that mean?<br> It means theyd send annual updates, photos,<br> let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up.<br> Whoah. I dont want photos or any kind<br> of notification.<br> Cant we just kick this old school? I stick the baby<br> in a basket and send it your way. Like Moses in the reeds.<br> Technically, that would be kickin it Old Testament.<br> Exactly! Right?<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> Like in the good old days.<br> When it was quick and dirty.<br> Well, then we all agree a traditional closed adoption<br> would be best for all involved?<br> Shit, yes, just close her on up.<br> Obviously, we would compensate you for<br> all your medical expenses.<br> Are you looking for any other<br> type of compensation?<br> Excuse me?<br> No.<br> No, I don't want to sell the thing, I just ...<br> ... I want ...<br> ... I just want the baby to be with people<br> who are gonna love it,<br> And be good parents, you know?<br> Im in high school.<br> Im ill-equipped.<br> Youre doing a beautiful and a<br> selfless thing for us.<br> Vanessa has wanted a baby ever since we<br> got married.<br> I want to be a mommy so badly!<br> You dont say.<br> Have you ever felt like<br> you were just born to do something?<br> Yes.<br> Heating and air conditioning.<br> There you go.<br> I was born to be a mother.<br> Some of us are.<br> How about you, Mark,<br> are you looking forward to being a dad?<br> Betcha, yeah.<br> Every guy wants to be a father.<br> Wants to coach the soccer team and<br> help out with the science fair and the<br> volcano goes off.<br> Yeah, all that.<br> Maybe Gerta could take us through the<br> preliminary documents that you have drawn up.<br> Could I use the facilities first? Being pregnant<br> makes me pee like Seabiscuit.<br> The downstairs bathroom is being re-tiled, but if you go<br> upstairs, then to the right ...<br> Oh yeah! Room with the toilet.<br> Is she alright?<br> Sorry.<br> Sorry, I didnt expect to see you up here.<br> I just came up to get something.<br> Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?<br> No.<br> Do we come off as<br> paranoid yuppies or something?<br> I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.<br> Really?<br> It's Clinique Happy.<br> Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes!<br> Is that supposed to make me feel happy?<br> You should feel happy, Holmes.<br> Im giving you and Vanessa the gift of life.<br> Sweet, screaming, pooping life!<br> And you dont even have to be there when it<br> comes out all covered in ...<br> Viscera?<br> Blood and guts.<br> Is that a Les Paul?<br> Yes, it is.<br> Vanessa gave me my own room for all my stuff.<br> She gave you your own room in your<br> whole house for your stuff?<br> Shes got you on a long leash there, Mark.<br> Oh, it's beautiful.<br> You know? I always loved<br> Gibson way more than Fender.<br> What do you play?<br> I rock a Harmony.<br> So is it mahagony?<br> What happens if you crack the neck?<br> Tell me about it. I used to play in this really tight band<br> when I lived in Chicago and one night we opened up<br> for the Melvins and I busted that thing right on stage<br> and it cost me $800 just to get it fixed.<br> When was that?<br> 93. Best time for rock and roll.<br> Nuh-uh, '77! Punk Volume #1.<br> You're crazy.<br> You werent there,<br> You couldn't understand the magic.<br> You werent even alive!<br> Whats that?<br> It's a Pilates machine.<br> What do you make with it?<br> You dont make anything. Its for<br> exercising.<br> My wife ordered one of those<br> Tony Little Gazelles off the TV.<br> You know, from the guy with the ponytail?<br> That guy just doesnt look right to me.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> You're playing music?<br> Juno wanted a little closer look at<br> Kimber.<br> Your guitar is named Kimber?<br> Yeah.<br> Thats cool. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin,<br> not Ted. He was the hot one with polio.<br> Gerta is downstairs, we still have<br> a lot of stuff to go over.<br> I got it.<br> Not to interrupt the jam session.<br> So, just look these over and if you have any questions,<br> call me at my office.<br> We would really appreciate it if you would just keep us<br> updated on any doctors appointments,<br> Ultrasounds,<br> anything of that nature.<br> For sure. You want to<br> know how your kid is cooking, I get it.<br> You think youre really<br> going to do this, then?<br> Yeah. I like you guys.<br> How sure would you say you are?<br> Would you say youre 80% sure, 90% sure?<br> Im going to say Im about 104% sure.<br> Really?<br> Seriously, if I could just have the thing and<br> give it to you now, I totally would,<br> But I'm guessing it looks probably like a<br> Sea Monkey right now,<br> And we should let it get a little cuter, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Great.<br> Keep it in the oven.<br> I think that's a great idea.<br> Nice to meet you both.<br> Please, drive carefully.<br> Hopefully we'll hear from you soon.<br> - Take care.<br> - Buh bye.<br> Hey, man.<br> Hey, Vijay.<br> Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?<br> Yeah.<br> - Like our moms and teachers!<br> - Yeah.<br> Did you hear its yours?<br> Yup.<br> What a trip, man.<br> I dont really know too much about it.<br> You should grow a moustache.<br> I cant.<br> Me neither.<br> But Im going to stop wearing underpants.<br> Raise my sperm count.<br> Juno, hey.<br> Hey, Bleek.<br> Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies after<br> school and we're gonna donut that flick<br> with the guy who has eighteen kids.<br> Do you want to come?<br> Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.<br> Oh, really?<br> Can I ...<br> ... Should I come?<br> Oh, you can't waste those donut balls,<br> But maybe I could drop by later.<br> Okay, cool.<br> - Later, Bleek.<br> - See ya.<br> I'll save you a seat.<br> There's your baby.<br> Oh, my God.<br> There's a hand.<br> And an arm.<br> And there's the feet.<br> Would you look at that?<br> Check out Baby Big-Head. Dude, that<br> thing is freaky looking!<br> Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel.<br> All youve got in your stomach is Taco Bell!<br> It's amazing that there's actually saps that<br> cry at this.<br> What? I'm not made of stone.<br> Well, there you have it.<br> Would you like to know the sex?<br> - Yes.<br> - No.<br> - Please, Junebug?<br> - No sex.<br> Planning to be surprised when you deliver?<br> I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if<br> you told me, I'll just ruin everything.<br> Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school?<br> No, theyre the adoptive parents.<br> Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.<br> Whats that supposed to mean?<br> I just see a lot of teenage mothers<br> come through here.<br> Its obviously a poisonous environment<br> to raise a baby in.<br> How do you know that Im so poisonous?<br> What if these adoptive parents<br> turn out to be evil molesters?<br> Or like stage parents.<br> They could be utterly negligent.<br> Maybe theyll do a far shittier job<br> of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter<br> ever would. Have you considered that?<br> No, I guess not.<br> What is your job title, exactly?<br> Im an ultrasound technician, maam.<br> Well Im a nail technician, and I think we both<br> ought to stick to what we know.<br> Excuse me?<br> You think youre so special because you get to play<br> Picture Pages up there?<br> My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you,<br> she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.<br> So why dont you go back to night school in Manteno<br> and learn a real trade!<br> Bren, yous a dick!<br> I love it.<br> Juno? Wow, I didnt expect to see you here.<br> I have something really cool to<br> show you guys. Is Vanessa here?<br> No, actually shes working late tonight.<br> Shes trying to accrue as much<br> time off as she can before ...<br> Oh right. I hear these are quite the time-suck.<br> Wanna come in? I was just having a Ginseng Cooler.<br> Would you like one?<br> What is it with you rich people and your<br> herb-infused juices?<br> It's probably got something to do with those<br> forty four-packs they come in.<br> Theyre not bad, though.<br> Why arent you at work?<br> I work mostly from home. Im a composer.<br> No shit.<br> Like Johannes Brahms?<br> No, more commercial stuff.<br> Like what?<br> Commercials.<br> Have you seen the ads for the<br> Titanium Power mens deodorant?<br> Paid for this kitchen.<br> Youre quite the sellout, Mark.<br> What would the Melvins say?<br> Did you say you had something to show me.<br> Behold, good sir! Your future child.<br> Hey, look at that.<br> I think it looks like my friend Paulie.<br> Is he also bald and amorphous?<br> No, hes the dad.<br> Can you tell if its a boy or a girl?<br> I can't, the doctor can.<br> But I kind of want it to be a surprise.<br> Well, it can only go one of two ways.<br> Thats what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might<br> end up with one of those scary neuter-babies thats born without junk.<br> Junk, huh?<br> You know, its parts.<br> I know what junk is.<br> Yeah, right.<br> We definitely want it to have some junk, please.<br> Well, you dont need to worry about a thing.<br> My stepmom, Bren, makes me eat super healthy.<br> I can't stand in front of the microwave<br> and no red M&Ms.<br> I hope you're ready.<br> Ooh... do you hear that?<br> What?<br> This is my favorite song. Its Sonic Youth doing<br> "Superstar" by the Carpenters.<br> Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters.<br> Chick drummer, freaky dude. Not<br> unlike the White Stripes.<br> You havent heard the Carpenters like this. Just listen.<br> Yeah, I like this.<br> What did you say your favorite band was?<br> Didnt. Its a three-way tie between the Stooges,<br> Patti Smith and the Runaways.<br> I definitely need to make you some CDs.<br> At least while my kid's in there.<br> The Wizard of Gore?<br> That is Herschel Gordon Lewis.<br> Hes the ultimate master of horror.<br> Please. Dario Argento is so the ultimate<br> master of horror.<br> Argento?<br> He's alright, but Lewis is<br> completely dimented.<br> Were talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup<br> all over the place. Fake brains coming out the yin-yang.<br> Quite frankly, this looks a little stupid.<br> Give me the tape.<br> This is even better than Suspiria.<br> What'd I tell ya?<br> You have decent taste in slasher movies.<br> Heres to dovetailing interests.<br> Have you guys thought of<br> any names for the baby yet?<br> Sort of, yes. Vanessa likes<br> Madison for a girl.<br> Madison?<br> Isn't that a little, gay?<br> Well, pretentious much? Should everyone just have a<br> mysterious name like Juno?<br> My dad went through this huge obsession with<br> Roman and Greek mythology.<br> He decided to name me after Zeuss wife,<br> Zeus had tons of lays, but Im pretty sure<br> Juno was his only wife.<br> She was supposed to be really beautiful but<br> really mean. Like Diana Ross.<br> That suits you.<br> Thanks?<br> Youre something else.<br> Vanessa. You'd better go.<br> She hates when I sit around watching movies<br> and I don't contribute.<br> Ill handle this. Im really good<br> at diffusing mom-type rage.<br> No, Juno, no.<br> Juno, what's going on?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What are you doing here? What's wrong?<br> Nothing, I went to the doctor today.<br> Is there something wrong with the baby?<br> The baby is great. Its the right size and everything.<br> I even saw its phalanges today!<br> Here.<br> It's the baby.<br> It's your baby.<br> It kinda looks like its waving.<br> Like its saying "Hey, Vanessa.<br> Will you be my mom?"<br> Yeah, it kind of does.<br> Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today.<br> I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo<br> off my pelvis.<br> It was crazy actually,<br> My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech<br> so we got escorted off the premises.<br> Wow, what kind of swag did you score?<br> Mall madness, huh?<br> Its just some stuff I picked up for the baby.<br> Don't you usually get all that<br> stuff at a baby shower?<br> When my stepmom was pregnant with my little sister<br> she got a million gifts.<br> But I wasn't jealous 'cause they all were super lame.<br> I doubt anyones gonna throw us a shower.<br> Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?<br> I don't think people know how to feel about this<br> situation because its not set in stone.<br> What isn't set ...<br> You don't think Im going to flake out on you?<br> No, I dont, Juno.<br> We went through a situation before<br> where it didnt work out.<br> Cold feet.<br> You should have gone to China.<br> I hear they give away babies like free iPods.<br> They put em in those T-shirt guns<br> and shoot them out at sporting events.<br> Your parents are probably wondering where you are.<br> Naah. Im already pregnant,<br> so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?<br> I should probably bounce.<br> Hey, dont forget your bag.<br> Ah, bag!<br> Okay, take care.<br> Where the hell have you been, Junebug?<br> I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.<br> I ended up staying for a couple of hours.<br> A couple of hours? Why are you<br> going over there in the first place?<br> They wanted to know about this stuff.<br> I said I'd keep them updated, so I did!<br> You could have mailed it to them.<br> Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?<br> I dont know, I just did.<br> And while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa,<br> we watched The Wizard of Gore,<br> And he burned me a couple of CDs of this weird music.<br> Hes kind of cool.<br> Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that.<br> No, it was not a big deal.<br> He was totally cool with it.<br> You don't understand.<br> Mark is a married man, there are boundaries.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Listen,<br> Bren-duhhh.<br> Youre acting like youre the one who has to go through this<br> and get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else.<br> What does it even matter if hes married?<br> I can have friends that are married.<br> It doesnt work that way, kiddo.<br> You dont know squat about the dynamics of marriage.<br> You dont know anything about me!<br> I know enough.<br> We don't even have a dog!<br> Yeah, because youre allergic to their saliva.<br> I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno.<br> But in a couple years when you move out<br> Im going to get Weimaraners.<br> Wow, dream big!<br> Oh, go fly a kite.<br> Hi, Juno.<br> What can I do for you?<br> Bleeker home?<br> Bleekers mom was possibly attractive once.<br> But now she looks a hobbit.<br> You know, the fat one that was in The Goonies.<br> Hey, man,<br> Dont concentrate so hard.<br> I think I can smell your hair all burning.<br> Hey, whats up?<br> Not much, I just wanted to come say hey.<br> I miss hanging out with you on school nights.<br> Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleekers one and only vice.<br> The day I got pregnant,<br> his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious.<br> You seem to be getting ...<br> ... pregnant-er these days.<br> Ya know, I set up this whole<br> private adoption ...<br> ... and this married couple in Saint Cloud<br> are going to be the parents.<br> Really?<br> What are they like?<br> The guy, he's awesome.<br> His name is Mark and<br> he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar.<br> We actually hung out this afternoon.<br> Is that normal?<br> Probably not, but ...<br> I talked to dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't<br> narc you out to your folks,<br> So,<br> I think we should be cool.<br> That's a relief.<br> Im gonna start looking<br> like a pretty big dork soon.<br> Will you still think Im cute when Im huge?<br> I always think youre cute.<br> I think youre beautiful.<br> Jeez, Bleek.<br> I do.<br> Hey Junebug, when this is all over we should get<br> the band back together.<br> Yeah.<br> That would be awesome.<br> Once Tino gets a new drumhead<br> we're just, like, ready to rock.<br> We could always get back together too.<br> That's an option.<br> Were we together?<br> Yeah, we were once.<br> That time.<br> What about Katrina De Voort?<br> You could totally go out with Katrina De Voort.<br> I dont like Katrina.<br> She smells like soup.<br> Her whole house smells of soup.<br> Okay.<br> So we have Custard, Cheesecake.<br> They're yellow.<br> I wanted to pick something that was gender-neutral<br> until we get the baby and then we can add a more decisive palette.<br> Why does everyone think yellow is gender-neutral?<br> I dont know any guy with a yellow bedroom.<br> I'm thinking more Custard with this light.<br> I dont know. Maybe I should paint a larger swatch ...<br> Or you could wait a few more months.<br> Its not like the babys going to storm in here<br> demanding dessert-colored walls.<br> "What to Expect" says that readying the babys room<br> is an important process for the woman.<br> Especially if you're adopting.<br> Its called "nesting."<br> Nesting?<br> Are you going to build the crib<br> out of sticks and spit?<br> You should read the book. I<br> flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.<br> I think its too early to paint.<br> Thats my opinion.<br> I disagree.<br> This wall is going to need something.<br> Our first family photo right in the middle.<br> Right up there.<br> Can you see it?<br> Yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin donut!<br> Share the love, sweetness!<br> You can't have any.<br> She's assaulting me!<br> Shes denying me fresh-baked goodness!<br> Oh, my God.<br> Thats her. Thats Vanessa Loring.<br> Of the Penny Saver Lorings?<br> Dude, she's, like, really pretty.<br> You sound totally shocked or something.<br> Shes totally gonna steal that kid for her collection.<br> Right, seriously.<br> Boring!<br> I could so go for a huge cookie right now<br> with like, a lamb kebab, simultaneously.<br> God, Spermy. Must you always feed?<br> It's like, never-ending for you.<br> Juno!<br> Hi, Vanessa!<br> What brings you to the mall today?<br> I was just shopping with my girlfriends.<br> You're gay?<br> No.<br> Just ignore her.<br> Well, how are you feeling?<br> Great! Everything's stupendous.<br> Oh, coming in on that snooze button.<br> Thats incredible.<br> Oh, God.<br> What?<br> Kicking away.<br> Could I feel it?<br> Are you kidding?<br> At school everyone's just grabbing my belly all the time.<br> Im a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.<br> I cant feel anything.<br> Its not moving for me.<br> You should try talking to it. They can hear you,<br> even though it's all ten thousand leagues under the sea.<br> Hi, baby.<br> Its me. It's Vanessa.<br> I cant wait to meet you.<br> Can you hear me, baby?<br> Sweet angel?<br> I felt it!<br> That was magical.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello?<br> Hey!<br> So, Ive been listening to<br> that really weird CD that you made me.<br> Yeah? Whats the verdict?<br> Well, its cute.<br> It's cute?<br> When youre used to listening to the raw power<br> of Iggy and the Stooges,<br> everything else just sounds kind of precious<br> in comparison.<br> I imagine you have a collection of<br> punk chestnuts to prove your point.<br> Well ...<br> ... consider it your musical education.<br> I can't wait to see what you've got to teach me.<br> Stop surfing porn and get back to work.<br> Just wanted to call and say hi.<br> Go learn something.<br> - Oh, a little trip down Mexico way.<br> - And Greece and China apparently.<br> How many months has it been now?<br> You're getting huge.<br> It's homing in on the eight.<br> You should see how weird I look naked.<br> I wish my funbags would get bigger.<br> Trust me, you dont. I have to actually<br> wear a friggin' bra now<br> and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff<br> on myself so my skin won't explode.<br> Hot!<br> Why is everyone always staring at me?<br> Well, you are kind of convex, you know?<br> Whoah! Who's been doing<br> their geometry homework for once!<br> I have no choice. Keith has been<br> grading me so hard lately.<br> Do not call Mr. Conyers "Keith".<br> 'Cause my barf reflex is<br> really enheightened these days.<br> But Keiths hot.<br> Eww, hes all beardy!<br> Did you hear that Bleek is going to the prom<br> with Katrina De Voort?<br> Katrina?<br> No way, he doesnt like Katrina.<br> Must be like a pity date or something.<br> I heard he asked her and that the're going to Benihana,<br> and then prom, and then Vijays parents cabin.<br> He told me that Katrinas house smells like soup!<br> Oh my God, it totally does.<br> I was there four years ago for her birthday party and it<br> was like Lipton Landing.<br> But you know, boys have endured<br> way worse things for nookie.<br> Oh, please.<br> There is no way that theyre having sex,<br> They wouldn't even be holding hands.<br> I wouldnt be so sure,<br> he did it with you.<br> Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me.<br> Were best friends.<br> Are you jealous?<br> I thought you said you didnt care what he did.<br> Not jealous, dont care.<br> I know Bleek doesnt like Katrina and he shouldn't<br> toy with her emotions like that. She seems pretty nice.<br> Uh-huh, Im really convinced.<br> Prom is for wenises, anyway.<br> As soon as youre old enough to go,<br> its so not cool anymore.<br> Are you honestly and truly going to the prom<br> with Katrina De Voort?<br> Uh, hi?<br> Leah just said that you were gonna go with her.<br> Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.<br> A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana,<br> then go the prom, then go to Vijays parents cabin.<br> Were getting a stretch limo.<br> Your mom must be pretty stoked that youre<br> not taking me.<br> Youre mad. Why are you mad?<br> Im not mad. Im in a great mood.<br> Despite the fact that Im in a fat suit I cant take<br> off, despite the fact that pretty much everyone is making<br> fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your<br> girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday.<br> Katrinas not my girlfriend! And I doubt<br> that she gave you the stinkeye.<br> That's just the way her face looks.<br> Just take Soupy Sales to prom, I can think of so<br> many cooler things to do that night.<br> I might pumice my feet or go to Brens Unitarian church,<br> maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice.<br> All those things would be exponentially cooler than<br> going to the prom with you.<br> Youre being really immature.<br> You have no reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart.<br> I should be royally ticked off at you.<br> I should be really cheesed off.<br> I shouldnt want to talk to you anymore.<br> Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you,<br> and then I didnt wanna, like, marry you?<br> Like Id marry you!<br> You'd be the meanest wife ever.<br> And I know that you werent bored that day<br> because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch<br> Project was coming on Starz, and you were like,<br> "I haven't seen this since it came out,<br> but we should make out instead. La la la."<br> You just take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom.<br> Im sure you two will have a real bitchin time!<br> I still have your underwear.<br> I still have your virginity!<br> Would you shut up!<br> What? Are you ashamed that we did it?<br> - No.<br> - 'Cause at least<br> you dont have to have the<br> evidence under your sweater.<br> Im a planet!<br> Wait, let me get your bag.<br> Whats another ten pounds?<br> Hi.<br> Wow. That shirt's working hard.<br> Is Vanessa here?<br> No. We are safe.<br> I'm glad you're here, I actually have something for you.<br> Almost there.<br> Whoah, Mark! Is this the babys room? Its beautiful!<br> Hilarious.<br> This is where I keep all my old comics,<br> And I want to show you one.<br> Youre one of those guys?<br> Take a look.<br> Most Fruitful Yuki?<br> Is this a pregnant superhero?<br> Isnt that great?<br> I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.<br> It reminds me of you.<br> Hells, yeah!<br> This actually makes me feel way less of a fat dork.<br> Yuki is a real bad ass.<br> You should be very proud being in the same condition.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, how about some tunage?<br> Alright, don't look, no matter what.<br> This one is actually kinda slow. But its<br> Mott the Hoople so its still totally rad and hardcore.<br> I know this one.<br> - You do?<br> - Yeah, this song is older than I am.<br> I danced to this at my senior prom.<br> Who'd you dance with?<br> Cynthia Vogel, great dance partner.<br> She let me put my hands all over her butt.<br> - Hot.<br> - Very hot.<br> I can just, totally, picture you dancing,<br> Like a total dork!<br> Her hands there,<br> And my hands down here.<br> This is how we did it in '88.<br> Like this?<br> Just like this.<br> Youve never been to a dance before?<br> Dances are for nerds and squares.<br> What are you?<br> I don't know.<br> I feel like theres something between us.<br> Im leaving Vanessa.<br> What?<br> Im getting a place in the city.<br> Its something Ive wanted to do for a long time.<br> No!<br> No?<br> No! You definitely can't do that.<br> Thats one big, fat sack of no!<br> What is the matter?<br> You guys are supposed to take care of this.<br> I thought you'd be cool with this.<br> I want things to be perfect. I don't want them<br> to be shitty and broken like everyone elses family.<br> Look, I'll have the baby, and Vanessa is<br> going to be so happy.<br> A baby is not going to fix everything.<br> Besides, I dont know if<br> Im even ready to be a father.<br> But youre old!<br> How do you think of me?<br> Why are you over here?<br> I ...<br> I just like being a piece of<br> furniture in your weird life.<br> This is what my life has become. I got stuff<br> in boxes. I'm underground. That's appealing to you?<br> - This is my fault.<br> - No.<br> Is Vanessa mad<br> at you because of me?<br> Thats got nothing to do with it.<br> Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.<br> You were in love when<br> you married her!<br> If you're in love once, you can be in love again. My friend Leah has been with the same guy four different times.<br> Youre just not trying hard enough.<br> Im such an idiot. I cant believe<br> what an idiot I am.<br> No, you know what, Mark.<br> Do not divorce your wife!<br> Will you please just do me a solid and stay<br> with Vanessa?<br> Youre so young.<br> I'm not that young. Im sixteen. Im old enough to know<br> when someone's acting like a total a-hole!<br> Oh, and you know what,<br> I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks!<br> Its just noise!<br> Juno? Whats going on?<br> Nothing.<br> Why are you crying?<br> Im not crying. Im just allergic to fine home furnishings.<br> Whats the matter?<br> Whats the matter?<br> Shes just a little hormonal. Right, Juno?<br> Its part of the process.<br> What did you do?<br> I didnt do anything ...<br> Just...<br> Ive been thinking.<br> - What?<br> - Just thinking if this is the right thing.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Just wondering if it's,<br> Just wondering if we're ready.<br> Yeah, we're ready.<br> Were ready. We've read the books, weve taken all the<br> classes. We have a nursery that is completely ...<br> Vanessa, I know were prepared.<br> I'm just wondering if ... Im ready.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Juno, dont listen to him.<br> He's just got cold feet.<br> He's just being a guy.<br> The books all say the same thing.<br> A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.<br> A man becomes a father when<br> he sees his baby.<br> Hes going to get there.<br> It just happened so fast. We put the ad in the paper<br> and I thought it was gonna take months if at all and then,<br> Two weeks later, shes on that couch.<br> She answered our prayers.<br> Ever since then its been like a ticking clock.<br> What are you saying?<br> That it feels a little like bad timing.<br> What would be a good time for you, Mark?<br> Theres just some things that<br> I still want to do.<br> Like what? Be a rock star?<br> Dont mock me.<br> I'm just saying that this is,<br> This is something that's never going to happen.<br> Your shirt is stupid.<br> Grow up.<br> If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain,<br> Im never going to be a mother.<br> I never said Id be a good father.<br> I called Gerta Rauss and she said that she can represent<br> both of us. It's called a "collaborative divorce."<br> Its all the rage right now, supposedly.<br> And it would be pretty easy because<br> we dont have any children.<br> Thanks for making the call, I guess.<br> Have you found a place to stay yet?<br> - Yeah, downtown.<br> - A hotel?<br> No, it's not a hotel.<br> Its a loft.<br> Arent you the cool guy?<br> I wanted a baby so bad.<br> I know.<br> - It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.<br> - Its for me.<br> I never realize how much I like being home unless<br> Ive been somewhere really different for a while.<br> Hey, Dad.<br> Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.<br> Where have you been?<br> Dealing with things way beyond my<br> maturity level.<br> Where is everybody?<br> Bren took Liberty Bell to her<br> tot ice skating class.<br> When will you guys learn that tots cant ice skate?<br> You're looking a little morose, honey.<br> Whats eating you?<br> Im just, like, losing my faith with humanity.<br> Can you narrow that down for me?<br> I just ...<br> ... wonder if ...<br> ... two people can stay together for good.<br> You mean like couples?<br> Yeah, like,<br> People in love.<br> Are you having boy trouble 'cause I gotta be honest; I dont really much approve of you dating in your condition,<br> Thats kind of messed up.<br> No, dad!<br> I mean, thats pretty skanky.<br> Isnt that what you girls call it?<br> Skanky? Skeevy?<br> Please stop.<br> Tore up from the floor up?<br> That's not what it's about.<br> I just need to know that its possible that<br> two people can stay happy together forever.<br> Its not easy, thats for sure.<br> I don't have the best track<br> record in the world, I know, but,<br> I've been with your stepmother<br> for ten years now,<br> and Im proud to say that were very happy.<br> Look ...<br> ... In my opinion ...<br> The best thing you can do is find a person<br> who loves you for exactly what you are.<br> Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,<br> Handsome, what have you,<br> the right person is still gonna think<br> the sun shines out of your ass.<br> Thats the kind of person thats worth<br> sticking with.<br> Yeah.<br> I think I've found that person.<br> Yeah, sure you have. Your old D-A-D!<br> You know Ill always be there to love you, support you,<br> no matter what kind of pickle youre in.<br> Obviously.<br> Dad, I think i'm just gonna,<br> shove out for a sec, but,<br> I won't be home late.<br> Okay.<br> You were talking about me, right?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Hi.<br> Did you put like a hundred things<br> of tic tacs in my mailbox?<br> Oh, yeah, that was me.<br> Why?<br> Theyre your fave.<br> You can never have too many of your<br> favorite one-calorie breath mint.<br> Yeah, well thanks, I ...<br> ... I think Im pretty much set until<br> college on the tic tac front.<br> You know, Bleek, I was thinking.<br> Im sorry I was such a huge bitch to you.<br> You don't deserve it.<br> Its okay.<br> Also,<br> I think Im in love with you.<br> What, you mean as friends?<br> No.<br> I mean, for real.<br> Because you're, like, the coolest person Ive ever met.<br> And you dont even have to try.<br> I try really hard, actually.<br> Youre, like, naturally smart.<br> You're not like everyone else.<br> You don't stare at my stomach all the time,<br> you look at my face.<br> And every time I see you,<br> the baby starts kicking super hard.<br> It does?<br> I think its because my heart<br> starts pounding everytime I see you.<br> Mine too.<br> Thats all I could ask for.<br> Youre golden, man.<br> Can we make out now?<br> Yeah.<br> You know, you can go into early<br> labor sucking face like that!<br> Dad!<br> What?<br> Dad, either I just peed my pants or ...<br> Or?<br> Thundercats are go!<br> All out, all out!<br> Do you have the admittance form?<br> What about the parking stickers?<br> Have you got Liberty Bell?<br> Oh, sweetie, sweetie!<br> Here we go.<br> Hurry! Start the car, go!<br> Gas!<br> - Wait, wait!<br> - Out of the way!<br> - Don't do that.<br> - What?<br> - That.<br> - But it's fun!<br> Bren, when do I get that friggin' Spinal Tap thing?<br> Its called a spinal block, and you cant have it yet, honey.<br> The doctor said youre not dilated enough.<br> Come on! I have to wait for it to get worse?<br> Why cant I just have the friggin' thing now?<br> Honey, doctors are sadists who like to<br> play God and watch lesser people scream.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Excuse me! Can we give my kid the damn<br> spinal tap already?<br> And then ...<br> ... out of nowhere ...<br> ... there it was ...<br> There he was.<br> I decided not to call Bleeker to<br> tell him that I was having the baby.<br> He had a big meet against Manteno and I didnt<br> want him to get all worried about me.<br> But he figured it out anyway.<br> Someday youll be back here, honey.<br> On your terms.<br> Hey.<br> Nice legs.<br> Bleeker decided he didnt want to see the baby.<br> Neither did I, really. He didnt feel like ours.<br> I think he was always hers.<br> Would you like to meet your son?<br> I have a son?<br> How do I look?<br> Like a new mom.<br> Scared shitless.<br> It ended with a chair.<br> As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss.<br> He is the cheese to my macaroni.<br> I know people are supposed to fall in love<br> before they reproduce, but,<br> I guess normalcys not really our style.<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> Ready?<br> Yeah.<br>
