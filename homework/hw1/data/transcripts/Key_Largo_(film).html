Nora!<br> - Yes, Father.<br> What ails that girl? She hurt?<br> Case of one too many, that's all.<br> Look here! If you people can't<br> behave yourselves, you gotta leave.<br> What did you hit her for?<br> I'll let you in on something.<br> She's a lush.<br> After she bends the elbow a few times,<br> she sees things:<br> Rats, roaches, snakes,<br> bats, you know.<br> A sock in the kisser is the only<br> thing that'll bring her out of it.<br> Your room's ready, major.<br> How long have they been here?<br> That one, Curly, and the woman<br> showed up first.<br> Dad Temple told them<br> we were closed...<br> ...but he offered to rent<br> the whole hotel for a week.<br> It was so much money,<br> Dad couldn't turn it down.<br> Mr. Brown and the others arrived<br> in that boat four days ago.<br> Which one is Brown?<br> He's in number 11.<br> Never comes out except at night.<br> What's he like?<br> He's a lady- killer,<br> or thinks so.<br> Rich, I guess. The others jump<br> when he lifts a finger.<br> Out of season in this heat.<br> Why would they decide<br> to sit down on Key Largo?<br> They'll be leaving here<br> tonight or tomorrow.<br> Major?<br> Were you with George when he died?<br> Was he in much pain?<br> He never knew what hit him.<br> I was afraid he might have suffered.<br> Come down to Dad's room<br> when you're ready.<br> Excuse me.<br> Staying the night, huh?<br> I'm Curly Hoff.<br> I heard how you were with<br> old man Temple's son in Italy.<br> The kid got it?<br> Too bad.<br> I hope you didn't take offense<br> how we handled you.<br> You caught Toots and me<br> at a bad time.<br> We were ready to bite<br> anybody's head off.<br> Especially a certain blond's.<br> Five of us come down here<br> for the deep- sea fishing.<br> All the way from Milwaukee.<br> More than a year, we'd been planning<br> to come here and fish our brains out.<br> So what happens?<br> One guy brings a blond.<br> And after we all swore<br> up and down, no dames!<br> But he's gotta bring her, this guy.<br> If she isn't drunk and crying,<br> she's got a hangover and arguing.<br> One minute she gets sore at you<br> and won't talk.<br> Next she's making a play for you<br> right in front of the guy!<br> And he gets sore at us,<br> mind you, not her.<br> Everything's spoiled,<br> including our dispositions.<br> It's cost us all this dough,<br> and for what?<br> The world's worst time.<br> I ask you, can you blame us<br> for getting rude?<br> - I don't blame you.<br> - How about a drink?<br> Not now, thanks.<br> Hotel Largo.<br> Just to show there's<br> no hard feelings.<br> No, thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Storm signals are up.<br> - What's that mean?<br> Hurricane's on its way.<br> See what I mean?<br> Hurricanes yet!<br> Dad's in here, major.<br> Sit down, major.<br> The war's over, Mr. Temple.<br> I'm not a major anymore.<br> I know the men that went don't<br> like talking about the war...<br> ...and I don't like imposing on you.<br> But this letter here<br> from the War Department...<br> ...is the only facts we have.<br> And it leaves us in the dark<br> about a few things.<br> I'll tell you everything I know.<br> Will you, Frank? Will you?<br> I'd be most grateful.<br> - Where shall I start?<br> - Anywhere.<br> He was a good soldier<br> from start to finish.<br> You'd have been proud.<br> Every man in his regiment was.<br> - Were they, Frank?<br> - With good reason.<br> It wasn't just a matter<br> of doing his duty.<br> He was always looking<br> for a way to do more.<br> And finding it.<br> George was a born hero.<br> He couldn't imagine his death.<br> Only dishonor.<br> No, of course not.<br> It's a wonder he lasted<br> till Cassino.<br> When you believe like George believed,<br> dying isn't very important.<br> Once, outside San Pietro,<br> George and a couple others...<br> ...established an observation post.<br> They got a direct hit,<br> and the others were killed.<br> That left it up to George.<br> Three days and three nights<br> he stayed awake directing our fire.<br> Most of that time, I was on<br> the other end of the line.<br> To keep himself awake,<br> he talked into the phone.<br> Talked and talked.<br> Most of his talk<br> was about you two.<br> You'd be surprised how much<br> I know about you both.<br> For instance, inside your<br> wedding ring there's an inscription:<br> "Evermore. "<br> That's right.<br> And you, Mr. Temple.<br> Remember telling George what<br> this hollow is above the upper lip?<br> Before he was born,<br> you said...<br> ...he knew all the secrets<br> of life and death.<br> And then at his birth, an angel<br> came and put his finger right here.<br> And sealed his lips.<br> I remember that.<br> He couldn't have been more<br> than 7 years old...<br> ...when I told him that fairy story.<br> What's it like where he's buried?<br> Just crosses on a slope.<br> High up, there's<br> what's left of a church.<br> You can see a river<br> from where George is.<br> I'd like to pay a visit to that place.<br> Yep, I would.<br> Nora, maybe we'll do just that.<br> Go to Italy and see<br> where George is buried.<br> It belongs to us, don't it?<br> That plot of ground?<br> I'm very grateful to you, Frank.<br> Thank you.<br> There was a storm warning, Dad.<br> You better see to the boat.<br> What brought you here?<br> Thought I might make<br> my living on the sea.<br> - Doing what?<br> - Doesn't matter. Hand on a boat.<br> Life on land's become<br> too complicated for my taste.<br> What'd you do before the war?<br> I was circulation manager<br> for a newspaper.<br> - You never went back to it?<br> - I couldn't stick it.<br> I've done lots since the paper.<br> Driving taxis, waiting on tables.<br> Anything to make a dollar.<br> Including day labor.<br> Getting kind of rough.<br> Major, this is Mr. Feeney.<br> - Hi.<br> - How do you do?<br> How's your ground tackle<br> off the stern?<br> Plenty heavy.<br> Then we'd just better double up<br> on these bowlines.<br> Where'd you learn about boats?<br> My first sweetheart was a boat.<br> How do you like that boat?<br> Nice. She should be away from<br> those reefs with this blow coming.<br> That so?<br> Put that on that piling over there.<br> Charlie!<br> Charlie Wenoka and his family<br> from Crawfish Island.<br> The Wenokas are royalty.<br> Charlie's a Seminole prince.<br> His ancestors go back to the gods.<br> He sells seashells by the seashore.<br> Hello, Mama Ochobee.<br> Every Indian here is<br> a descendent of Mama Ochobee.<br> She admits to being 108 years old.<br> But she has a son who's 112.<br> We suspect Mama doesn't tell<br> the truth about her age.<br> Him new husband? No, Mama.<br> Not new husband.<br> You got cigarette?<br> Pretty big blow coming?<br> Indians always know.<br> Don't ask me how, but they do.<br> More will be along. They come to<br> us from as far as Matecumbe Key.<br> This one was born in our lobby<br> during the last big blow.<br> Hello, Tom.<br> Hello, John.<br> Tom and John are Osceola.<br> How do you do?<br> We get Mr. Temple message.<br> We hear give ourself up to police.<br> He thinks it's the best.<br> What Mr. Temple say, we do.<br> Him good friend to Indian.<br> Why don't you go to the hotel?<br> Dad'll call Palm Grove.<br> Thanks, Miss Nora.<br> Poor fellas got into some trouble<br> and were arrested.<br> I know.<br> Mr. Temple told me about them.<br> They really trust Dad Temple.<br> All the Indians.<br> As far as they're concerned,<br> he's the United States of America.<br> You're very happy here,<br> aren't you?<br> - Very.<br> - You're never lonely?<br> Did George tell you?<br> I met him at a USO dance.<br> He was lonesome.<br> He wanted company.<br> I was working at a defense plant.<br> I knew lots of people,<br> but I was lonesome too.<br> Before George, my life<br> hadn't made much sense.<br> I never had much of a home,<br> and I didn't like what I had.<br> George...<br> ...gave me roots.<br> When he went overseas,<br> I came here to stay with his father...<br> ...and the roots took hold.<br> Now I'm like one of those mangroves.<br> Our police always get their Indian.<br> Close the shutters<br> while I get the oil lamps.<br> Hey, pal.<br> Getting ready for the hurricane?<br> - Join me for that little drink now?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Not a drinking man?<br> - Not right now.<br> Hey, Curly.<br> What all happens in a hurricane?<br> The wind blows so hard<br> the ocean gets up on its hind legs...<br> ...and walks right across the land.<br> And singing a song:<br> Rain, rain go away<br> Little Ralphie wants to play<br> Isn't that Ben Wade's car?<br> Nora! Have you seen him?<br> No, Dad. I haven't.<br> They're snooping around looking<br> for these two boys, and here they are.<br> Better go out there and sit<br> in his car and wait for him.<br> Better yet, go and find him.<br> What's so funny, Toots?<br> There are two cons in a cell.<br> One tries to sell the other<br> a fountain pen.<br> And he says,<br> "This pen is guaranteed for life.

Hear me!<br> I'll kill you!<br> Make a big wave.<br> Send it against us.<br> Take us all.<br> But destroy him.<br> Mr. Temple!<br> Mr. Temple!<br> The storm's passing.<br> A torn shutter or two,<br> some trash on the beach...<br> In a few hours, there'll be little<br> to remind you of what happened.<br> Will we ever see you again?<br> The storm.<br> It's passing.<br> - Will we?<br> - I hope so.<br> Why don't you stay here with us?<br> You're most welcome.<br> Go on, tell him.<br> If he decides to stay here with us,<br> we'd be most happy.<br> Go on, tell Frank.<br> Have you any folks?<br> I'd be proud to have you<br> regard us as your family.<br> Maybe that isn't what Frank wants.<br> I don't mean to set onto you.<br> Think it over.<br> Don't give your answer right away.<br> Hey, boss! Hey, boss!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - The boat's gone!<br> He did it.<br> I told him I'd kill him.<br> He did it just the same.<br> Maybe he'll come back.<br> The storm's over.<br> Why not?<br> He believed I'd kill him.<br> What'll we do?<br> - We can't stay here!<br> - Can we?<br> Hey, boss?<br> Your mistake, sister.<br> - We're not in any trouble.<br> - Got something?<br> There's another boat out there.<br> It ain't much, but it'll get us to Cuba.<br> Who's going to run it?<br> Him.<br> Mr. Temple!<br> You not good man!<br> You not let nobody in!<br> That's no good!<br> Tom Osceola.<br> - Tom! Tom...<br> - Shut up!<br> You leave women and baby out in storm?<br> That no good!<br> You no more friend.<br> We no do like you say anymore!<br> No go Ben Wade!<br> You no good friend to Indian!<br> You told me you sent them away.<br> You lied to me. They were outside<br> my door during the whole storm.<br> - So what?<br> - They might've died out there.<br> And who cares?<br> You filth.<br> What he said, you can run a boat.<br> That's a fact?<br> His first sweetheart was a boat.<br> You're taking us to Cuba.<br> - Why should I?<br> - You know what'll happen if you don't.<br> I won't take you.<br> You'd rather die than take us?<br> I didn't say that.<br> You won't kill me.<br> I'm your only chance of getting away.<br> There's other ways of getting<br> at you. Right, Toots?<br> Right.<br> - Maybe I'm up to them.<br> - You wouldn't be.<br> After a few minutes of Toots,<br> you'll begin to ask questions like:<br> "What if I come out of this<br> a cripple?"<br> And "Do I care whether they make<br> their getaway or don't?"<br> All your answers<br> would be right ones.<br> - I'm not so sure.<br> - I am.<br> Of course, if you're anxious<br> to find out...<br> ...just how good you are at taking it,<br> we'll accommodate you.<br> But I warn you...<br> ...Toots hasn't had much practice.<br> Kind of rusty.<br> Might slip.<br> And that would be too bad.<br> Because you made real sense<br> upstairs when you said...<br> ...one Rocco more or less<br> ain't worth dying for.<br> Ziggy!<br> The law!<br> One wrong word out of anybody<br> and he gets it...<br> ...the same as Sawyer did.<br> Understand me, old man?<br> Now, you, sister, let him in.<br> Good evening.<br> I'm looking for Sawyer.<br> Is he here?<br> Has he been here?<br> That's funny. He put a call<br> into me from here about 7:00.<br> Did he?<br> Good evening.<br> Folks.<br> Pretty good blow.<br> Did some damage, I see.<br> Power lines are down<br> in a couple of places.<br> - How's the road?<br> - Passable.<br> I'm trying to locate Sawyer.<br> Seen him, anybody?<br> Have you seen Sawyer?<br> He was here. I know<br> because he called me from here.<br> About 7:00.<br> I called back<br> a few minutes later.<br> Somebody answered.<br> Was it one of you?<br> I did.<br> Oh, you?<br> I came down from upstairs<br> when you called.<br> Nobody was around,<br> so I answered.<br> Probably he stopped in to call.<br> Then he went on and got caught<br> in the storm.<br> He's stalled along the road<br> right now, probably.<br> He ain't between here<br> and Palm Grove.<br> And he wouldn't have called me<br> unless it was special.<br> Seen the Osceola brothers?<br> Have you?<br> I figured that was what it was about.<br> His call, I mean.<br> The Osceola brothers.<br> Couple of Indians busted out of jail,<br> and we're looking for them.<br> I'll take a run down Matecumbe Way.<br> If Sawyer shows up, tell him<br> to wait. I'll be back.<br> See you later.<br> First visit to the Keys, Mr...?<br> Brown.<br> Late in the season for a storm.<br> They usually hit early summer.<br> - Is that so?<br> - Been doing any fishing?<br> There's no better fishing<br> than on the Keys.<br> See you later.<br> It's him!<br> Sawyer!<br> He's murdered!<br> I didn't wanna say anything.<br> It's not my business.<br> But those Indians you were<br> talking about, they were here.<br> The Osceolas?<br> They were here during the storm.<br> They left a couple of minutes ago.<br> Stop!<br> Stop or I'll shoot!<br> Watch yourselves.<br> Stay in line.<br> He's dead!<br> Your Indians murdered Sawyer!<br> You lied to me.<br> You said you hadn't<br> seen the Osceolas. You lied.<br> Sawyer was here. He called<br> because he'd found the Osceolas.<br> They tried to hide it<br> by sinking his body...<br> ...but the storm tore his body loose<br> and threw it up!<br> Right at your door!<br> And that's where the crime belongs,<br> at your door.<br> You probably knew they killed Sawyer.<br> I wouldn't put it past you!<br> And I'm gonna lay charges<br> naming you as accessory.<br> What was the shooting?<br> The Osceolas tried to get away.<br> I killed them both.<br> Brown, what's your first name?<br> Howard.<br> Address?<br> Hotel Central, Milwaukee.<br> - How long you gonna be here?<br> - A week.<br> Haven't I seen you<br> someplace before?<br> I don't think so.<br> You.<br> Hoff.
