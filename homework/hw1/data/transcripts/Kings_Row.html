                        What are you waiting for?<br> - So long, Drake.<br> - Parris!<br> - Hello, Cassie.<br> - Hello, Parris.<br> I'll get another one.<br> It's warm.<br> Warm enough to go in swimming, I guess.<br> Unbutton my back. I can't reach.<br> - There.<br> - Thanks.<br> It's not so warm on the bottom.<br> Girls have to go in gradual.<br> I'll be glad when school's out, won't you?<br> We'll go swimming every day then,<br> won't we?<br> I'll have to dry my hair out<br> so Papa won't know.<br> He'd take a switch to me, I guess.<br> You're awfully pretty, Cassie.<br> - Am I? Honestly?<br> - You bet.<br> I guess you're the prettiest girl<br> in the whole school.<br> - Goodbye, then.<br> - Goodbye.<br> But I'm late with my practicing.<br> Here's something came for you,<br> delivered most impressively<br> by a young lady.<br> Thank you.<br> - You are hungry?<br> - Of course.<br> Louise Gordon is having a party<br> on Saturday, too.<br> The same day<br> as Cassandra Tower's birthday party.<br> I bet she did it on purpose.<br> Well, you go to the Gordons,<br> if you want my opinion.<br> Anna, Parris has learned<br> to decide for himself<br> what's right and what's wrong.<br> Just the same, there is something queer<br> about those Towers.<br> A doctor who says he's a doctor,<br> but never has a patient.<br> And his wife, who stays<br> in that upstairs room all the time.<br> It gives a person the creeps.<br> It ain't the proper association<br> for a boy like him...<br> I don't care what anybody says<br> about the Towers.<br> I'm going to Cassie's party.<br> Would you like to play some more games?<br> No, I wouldn't.<br> I wish everybody'd go home.<br> I'll go home if you want me to.<br> Then maybe the others will follow suit.<br> I invited ever so many.<br> Well,<br> I'll go say my goodbyes.<br> Mrs. Tower.<br> Oh, Mrs. Tower!<br> Mrs. Tower!<br> Oh, Mrs. Tower.<br> - Boy, where are you going?<br> - To say goodbye to Mrs. Tower, sir.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> Grand-mre told me to be sure<br> to pay my respects, Dr. Tower.<br> I'll see that Mrs. Tower<br> receives your message.<br> Why didn't she come down, sir?<br> - Doesn't Cassie's mother like parties?<br> - Cassandra, here's a guest leaving.<br> - Goodbye, Cassie.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Oh, gee, what a shame.<br> - All that ice cream and cake, too.<br> - I imagine we'll survive it.<br> - I had a lovely time, sir.<br> - Goodbye. Thank you for coming.<br> Thank you for inviting me.<br> - You're Parris Mitchell, aren't you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Give my regards to your grandmother.<br> Come, Parris! Come on in!<br> Oh, let him alone. We don't want him.<br> Hey, Parris. Wait a minute.<br> That sure was a sissy party.<br> - How was Cassie's?<br> - How did you think it would be?<br> Well, heck, Parris. Don't bark at me.<br> I'm kind of ashamed of myself as it is.<br> Everybody showing up at Louise's.<br> Even me.<br> But I left to come with you, didn't I?<br> - That's why you did? Just to be with me?<br> - Sure it is.<br> Let's go down to the depot.<br> Maybe we'll run into Fulmer Green<br> and his gang.<br> They're tough as all get-out.<br> "Baltimore and Ohio."<br> Oh, "Chesapeake and Illinois".<br> Look, there's one from way out West.<br> Denver and Rio Grande.<br> I bet that's a good railroad, don't you?<br> Hi, Drake. Hi, Parris.<br> - Up here on the fence.<br> - Hiya, Red.<br> - What you doing up there?<br> - Oh, this is where I live.<br> - What are you all doing way down here?<br> - Going down to Elroy's icehouse.<br> - What for?<br> - Swing on the rings.<br> - Why don't you come, too?<br> - All right.<br> You go on. I'll catch up with you.<br> - Why didn't she come right along with us?<br> - Say, you don't know much, do you?<br> I guess her old man knows better<br> than to let her go around with boys.<br> She's kind of tough, though.<br> You ought hear her cuss.<br> Watch this.<br> Oh, I can do that.<br> Try this!<br> Here I come.<br> Doggone!<br> - Go on, Parris, you skin the cat.<br> - Go ahead, Parris.<br> I'll bet you can't do it.<br> Go on, hurry up!<br> Come on.<br> Try it again. Try it again.<br> Trouble is your pants are too tight.<br> Take them off, why don't you?<br> I can't.<br> I haven't got anything on under them.<br> Oh! Bye, you all.<br> I'm coming down<br> this way again sometime, Red.<br> All right! It's a free country. I guess.<br> Look at those horses.<br> Doc Gordon's buggy, ain't it?<br> Willy McIntosh.<br> I heard his pa's sicker than a cat.<br> You ask him. You're gonna be a doctor.<br> I'm sorry about your father, Willy.<br> What's Dr. Gordon going to do to him?<br> He's going to do an operation!<br> Pa's got ulcers on his leg.<br> - What's ulcers?<br> - I don't know.<br> They're terrible bad, though.<br> - He's got to have them cut out.<br> - I hope your father will...<br> He's got to quit that. That's my pa!<br> Didn't Dr. Gordon<br> give your old man chloroform?<br> The doctor says he's got heart disease.<br> I thought they had to give chloroform<br> for an operation.<br> He's gotta quit that. He's gotta quit!<br> I'll kill that old doctor. I'll kill him!<br> Let's get out of here.<br> I never heard a grown man cry and holler<br> like that before, did you?<br> Bye, Drake. I had a good time today.<br> Sure. Why not?<br> You stick with me<br> and I can teach you a lot.<br> I guess you can, all right.<br> Sure. We're friends<br> and we ought to go on being friends.<br> Drake McHugh.<br> Get in here and do your chores!<br> All right, Aunt Mamie!<br> Here's where I catch it again.<br> - Remember what I just said.<br> - I sure will, Drake.<br> Parris?<br> For heaven sake. Is that you, Cassie?<br> Where have you been?<br> Well, down to the tracks<br> with Drake McHugh,<br> and to Elroy's icehouse.<br> He and I and Randy Monaghan<br> swung on the rings.<br> Did you swing on the rings<br> with Randy Monaghan?<br> That doesn't mean anything.<br> Say, don't you know it's almost dark.<br> I just had to tell you something,<br> something terrible.<br> Here, I've got a hankie some place.<br> I can't go to school anymore.<br> You can't?<br> Papa says he's gonna teach me<br> out of books and things.<br> He says it'll be better for me.<br> - But everybody goes to school.<br> - I don't. Not anymore.<br> But if you don't go to school,<br> then you can't walk home with me,<br> or go swimming<br> or play with me or anything.<br> Maybe I can't ever go anywhere.<br> Maybe I'll just have to stay home<br> like Mama does all the time.<br> Gee!<br> Cassie, wait a minute!<br> Cassie!<br> Whoa there!<br> Well, for Pete's sake! Look who's here.<br> - Parris!<br> - Hello, Drake.<br> Where you been keeping yourself?<br> This is the fella I was telling you about.<br> Meet the Ross girls,<br> Jinny and Poppy Ross.<br> - How do you do? I've heard about you...<br> - Oh, I'll just bet you have.<br> Say, how do you like<br> my new horse and buggy?<br> Just got my allowance yesterday.<br> What have you been doing<br> with yourself, anyway?<br> I've been pretty busy, Drake. College...<br> He's studying to be a doctor.<br> He's smart as a whip.<br> Hey, climb in the buggy<br> and forget your studies.<br> We're going out for a ride in the country.<br> Sit Jinny on your lap or I'll give you Poppy<br> if you like them plump. I do!<br> - Some other time, Drake...<br> - Well, there's no time like right now.<br> Why, I can't go this afternoon.<br> I'm on my way to see, well, Dr. Tower.<br> - Cassie's old man? What for?<br> - I'm gonna read medicine with him.<br> Say, I didn't know anybody<br> ever got to see the Towers.<br> - How long has this been going on?<br> - Oh, it hasn't.<br> This is the first time I've been there.<br> - Cassie Tower? Ain't she the one...<br> - Sure, she is.<br> Her old man keeps her under lock and key<br> like he thought every fellow in town<br> was aiming to kidnap her.<br> I guess they'd like to at that.<br> Say, I haven't seen Cassie<br> since we were kids together in school.<br> - Have you?<br> - No. No, I haven't.<br> Sure wish I was in your boots.<br> Let me know how you come out.<br> I'll have to go now.<br> Only gal in school<br> that used to wear silk stockings.<br> I'm sorry about this afternoon.<br> Some other time.<br> Oh, sure, kid. See you soon.<br> Well, here we go.<br> Cassie?<br> Down there. The last door.<br> - How are you, Cassie?<br> - I'm all right.<br> I'm sorry to hear your mother isn't well.<br> Down there.<br> Come in.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> Hereafter, you may come around<br> to the study door.<br> It won't be necessary<br> for you to come through the house.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I said, hereafter, you will use this door.<br> You will come through it<br> and you will leave through it.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I understand your grandmother proposes<br> sending you to medical school in Vienna.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, if you have any brains,<br> I might be able to prepare you<br> for the examinations.<br> Do you want to be a good doctor<br> or one of these country quacks?<br> Oh, I want to be a good one like...<br> - Like whom?<br> - Like those you read about in books.<br> What books?<br> I got into it that time, didn't I, sir?<br> I guess I mean<br> the legendary sort of doctor.<br> Well, Mitchell,<br> of course, I don't know at all<br> your approach to medicine.<br> Perhaps you regard it as an opportunity<br> to become one of those bedside manners<br> with a list of the proper pills<br> to give the patient,<br> particularly when you don't know<br> what is the matter with him.<br> Or perhaps your aim is<br> to become an eminent carpenter<br> with a knife and a chisel and a saw.<br> Perhaps, even you flow over<br> with the nobility of relieving<br> humanity's suffering.<br> I'll tell you my approach to medicine.<br> It is a game.<br> It is a game in which man pits his brain<br> against the forces of destruction<br> and disease.<br> In the beginning, I don't expect you<br> to be able to participate in the game.<br> You'll only listen and accept.<br> You will study and you will make notes<br> and you will memorize,<br> and you will do all this<br> only because I tell you to.<br> The details are simple, Colonel.<br> I want to leave everything to Parris<br> so that his schooling is assured.<br> I want to do the best I can for him<br> with what I have.<br> Yes, yes, of course. Of course.<br> It's wise to have a will, ma'am.<br> Then, in case anything<br> should happen to you unexpectedly...<br> It wouldn't be unexpected now, Isaac.<br> I think it's urgent<br> we complete arrangements quickly.<br> Marie, I'll have to be blunt.<br> How much time do you think you have?<br> Well, Henry?<br> Madam has a few months, a year at best.<br> I don't believe it.<br> I don't believe a word of it.<br> But we'll act as if Gordon knows<br> what he's talking about.<br> You don't look it, Marie.<br> You don't look it in the least.<br> We all have to die. I shan't want to.<br> For Parris' sake, I shan't want to at all.<br> But if you'll please excuse me.<br> I feel a little tired now.<br> Certainly, Marie.<br> - Good night, my dear friend.<br> - Good night.<br> Thank you both for your kindness.<br> I think I'll go to bed now, Anna.<br> When she passes,<br> how much passes with her?<br> A whole way of life.<br> A way of gentleness.<br> And honor and dignity.<br> These things are going, Henry.<br> And they may never come back<br> to this world.<br> - You are up late.<br> - So are you.<br> But every night.<br> These books, so thick and heavy.<br> Do you have to read them all?<br> I guess these books<br> are only the beginning.<br> You like to read them?<br> And Dr. Tower, do you like him?<br> You knew I would when you sent me.<br> Confess.<br> I only know that you have to judge people<br> by what you find them to be<br> and not by what other people say they are.<br> Oh, I don't pretend to understand him.<br> What he's like, I mean.<br> But he's the most brilliant man I ever met.<br> I know I'm lucky to be working with him.<br> Does he like you?<br> Half the time<br> he doesn't even know I'm there.<br> Well, he will. He should.<br> Go to bed now, Parris.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - Oh, you're one to talk.<br> - Put her to bed at once, Anna.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Listen to the man.<br> Good night, my darling.<br> I'm crazy about you, lady.<br> - Good night, Anna.<br> - Good night, Parris.<br> And in diagnosis,<br> you must never underrate<br> the value of subconscious observation.<br> Instinct, if you want to call it that.<br> Or, more properly, intuition.<br> It's what makes a born physician.<br> Better ease up a little on your work,<br> young man.<br> - Oh, I'm quite all right, sir.<br> - You don't look it.<br> We've had a hard winter.<br> Take the afternoon off.<br> Get outside somewhere.<br> You need to see some other boys.<br> Rowdy around a little. Do you good.<br> - What is it? Have you no friends?<br> - I have one, sir.<br> Well, a little loneliness won't hurt you,<br> to speak of.<br> You get used to it.<br> There's something I want to speak of.<br> I was terribly sorry about Mrs. Tower.<br> No one seemed to know about the funeral.<br> Thank you. I received your note<br> and your grandmother's.<br> I'd like to see Cassandra<br> and tell her, too, if I may.<br> I shall be very glad to tell Cassandra,<br> thank you.<br> Dr. Tower...<br> You have a question?<br> No, sir.<br> - Run along, my boy.<br> - Goodbye, Doctor.<br> Hi, Parris.<br> Gee, Drake, I'm glad to see you.<br> You know, kid,<br> if you're gonna keep your nose<br> buried in those books all the time,<br> it's up to me to look you up.<br> - Hop in.<br> - Sure.<br> Say, it's funny,<br> you coming along this afternoon, Drake.<br> Dr. Tower just told me I ought to see you.<br> - Me?<br> - He said I ought to look up my friends.<br> Oh, that's me all over.<br> - How's Cassie?<br> - I don't know.<br> What do you mean you don't know?<br> Well, Dr. Tower makes me<br> use the side door<br> - and I just don't see her.<br> - I bet I'd find a way.<br> You know, kid, if you don't go out<br> after things in this world,<br> you don't get anything.<br> You never did come with me<br> to see the Ross gals.<br> I took them and Dudley Wright<br> down to Whaley's pond<br> just last week on a picnic.<br> Hotchy-koo, boy!<br> - Where we going now, Drake?<br> - We're gonna stop by the Gordons.<br> I want you to help me talk to Louise.<br> What do you want me<br> to talk to Louise about?<br> Well, she's the gal I've decided to marry.<br> Drake, you're gonna get married?<br> Didn't you know about me and Louise?<br> I thought everybody knew everything<br> about everybody in this town.<br> Just do this for me, will you, kid?<br> I'm in a mess. You'll see.<br> It's almost time<br> for Papa and Mama to come home.<br> - Drake, don't you think you...<br> - No!<br> Make Drake calm down, Parris.<br> Oh, I know Papa's unreasonable.<br> He's mean to me.<br> But I'm a girl, and I'm afraid of him.<br> Well, what's the old geezer<br> got against me?<br> Why can't I ever see you anymore?<br> Will you be mad if I tell you something?<br> Well, what? I don't know. I'm already mad.<br> I won't talk about it then.<br> Go on. What is it?<br> All right, I'll tell you what Papa said.<br> Well...<br> It's about Poppy Ross.<br> Oh, that.<br> He said you're wild.<br> Of course, I don't pay any attention.<br> I know you've been taking her out<br> buggy riding.<br> I don't mind. Not too much.<br> I know you get lonesome<br> and you're not in love with Poppy,<br> but I'm lonesome, too,<br> and I haven't any Poppy Ross.<br> And people are talking<br> and Papa and Mama hear them...<br> What's that?<br> Quick. Go out the back way.<br> I think it's time<br> we looked the old mossbacks in the eye.<br> Drake, you're all worked up.<br> Maybe if you come out and cool off...<br> Is this your doing, Louise?<br> No, it's mine, Dr. Gordon.<br> I want to speak to you.<br> I've nothing to say or listen to.<br> Then I'd like to talk to you, Mrs. Gordon.<br> Drake McHugh, it's a mercy<br> your dear Aunt Mamie isn't alive<br> to see you these days.<br> - She was a righteous, God-fearing woman.<br> - Oh, can it.<br> - Well, I guess it's up to you, Louise.<br> - What do you mean, Drake?<br> I won't get the money<br> my Aunt Mamie left me for two years,<br> but until then<br> we can make out together somehow.<br> That settles that. Let's go.<br> Wait a minute, Drake. I...<br> Just because I'm out in the open<br> about things!<br> - Just because I don't sneak around.<br> - Now, be reasonable, Drake.<br> I'll show them. I'll get my horse and buggy<br> and drive by the Gordons every day<br> with Poppy Ross. I don't care.<br> I'll even have her right to my house<br> if I want to.<br> Say, I wonder why I never thought of that.<br> It is awfully hard<br> for a girl to stand up against her family.<br> All right, I know. I'm always wrong.<br> I always have been<br> ever since I can remember.<br> Hello, Cassandra. It's me, Parris.<br> I didn't want to scare you.<br> Why, hello.<br> - Come in.<br> - I was on my way home<br> when I remembered<br> I left my notebooks today.<br> Oh...<br> Come on in.<br> I guess you know where they are.<br> Yes. The doctor always leaves them<br> in the same drawer.<br> Sit down?<br> I'd like to.<br> Is your father in?<br> He's gone to St. Louis. The 6:00 train.<br> He'll be back Tuesday.<br> - Do you have to go?<br> - No.<br> - May I stay a while?<br> - Over here by me.<br> I...<br> Do you know, Cassie, I haven't seen you<br> to talk to you, really, in a long time.<br> Yes, I know.<br> All the time I've been coming<br> to study with your father<br> - I'd been hoping I'd see you.<br> - It'll probably be the only time.<br> Oh, why?<br> I can't see anyone, ever.<br> Don't you know that?<br> - Your father won't let you?<br> - I said I can't see anyone.<br> You don't have to ask questions<br> to understand that, do you?<br> Well, I don't know. I want to ask you why,<br> if you don't want to tell me,<br> - if you don't want to see me...<br> - Oh, don't get your feelings hurt, Parris.<br> Just let's talk.<br> All right, Cassie.<br> - What can we talk about?<br> - Oh, anything.<br> Tell me what you do all the time.<br> I just read and study and practice,<br> that's all.<br> - Do you still study music?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, I just read and study,<br> so I guess you're ahead of me.<br> I never see people.<br> I just read books.<br> Why'd your father take you out of school<br> when you were such a little girl?<br> Was it because...<br> If you want to know,<br> why don't you ask him?<br> Always, after that, I kept remembering.<br> Little things.<br> How you'd trot along the road with me<br> home from school.<br> The way you had of tilting your head<br> when you'd look up.<br> The color that the sun made your hair<br> when you said, "I like to be your girl.<br> "I guess you're my sweetheart, too."<br> That's the way I thought of you<br> most of the time.<br> Then sometimes I'd remember<br> you were growing up, too.<br> Why, you were 16, now 18.<br> Then I'd wonder what you were doing,<br> right then, at that moment.<br> Were you sewing<br> or studying your lessons or crying or<br> could you be laughing?<br> Could you be laughing<br> when I was thinking so hard about you<br> - and feeling so terrible?<br> - Children can be so silly.<br> Oh, no. No, I don't mean that, Parris.<br> You were always the nicest.<br> Oh, just talk about something else,<br> will you?<br> You are pretty, Cassie.<br> Really you are.<br> You're prettier than you ever have been,<br> and you always have been<br> the prettiest girl in town.<br> Don't!<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - Cassie.<br> - Parris.<br> - Hey, who's out there?<br> - It's me, Drake. Parris.<br> Well, for Pete's sake, what're you doing<br> around here this time of night?<br> - Let me in, quick.<br> - Be right down, kid.<br> - What's up?<br> - Nothing.<br> I just came by. Just took the chance.<br> - Drake, can I stay here with you tonight?<br> - Say, are you crazy, you galoot?<br> No, I don't guess I am.<br> Hey, something's happened<br> and you'd better tell me what it is.<br> Why, I just want to stay here.<br> I'll telephone at home in the morning<br> - and say I stayed here with you all night.<br> - All right, all right.<br> But I just want to make sure<br> you're not in any trouble, kid.<br> - You better tell me where you've been.<br> - I'd rather not, Drake.<br> For Pete's sake, you!<br> What's funny?<br> And I've been saying I'd take you around<br> and show you the ropes!<br> Well, for Pete's sake!<br> Come on, get that wet coat off!<br> I'll fix you a cup of coffee.<br> It won't take a minute.<br> No, no, thanks. I don't want any.<br> Well, all right then.<br> Come on up and get these wet clothes off.<br> Say, I'll have to take care of you now.<br> Come on, pile into bed.<br> Of course, you'll have to bunk with me.<br> I hope you won't mind, Mr. Mitchell.<br> It's just as I say, madam.<br> All the time he comes in, then he goes out.<br> He wanders all over the place,<br> absentminded and just looks at things.<br> - Maybe there is a girl.<br> - It's something more than a girl, madam.<br> He's in love with here, with this place.<br> I have no idea what you're talking about.<br> Madam, I've watched him grow<br> every day of his life.<br> I feel, in here,<br> sometimes just what he feels.<br> It's this, I think he feels change.<br> I think he's afraid something is to happen<br> and he doesn't understand.<br> - Anna, you haven't told him.<br> - No, madam.<br> He mustn't know, Anna.<br> Oh, no, madam, when I think...<br> Don't cry, Anna, for me.<br> It will be worse for him.<br> My troubles are almost over<br> and his are just beginning.<br> Growing up is so difficult, Anna.<br> The disappointments and the heartbreaks.<br> The frightening problems.<br> The meannesses<br> and the cruelties of the world.<br> How often I have wished<br> that his mother be lived,<br> or his father.<br> Or that I were his mother.<br> It isn't fair that a young boy<br> should be brought up by an old woman<br> who will leave him<br> when he needs her most.<br> What's going to happen to him?<br> - Parris is a good boy, madam.<br> - I hope so.<br> I've done my best<br> to make him into a gentleman.<br> And my best to provide for his future.<br> For the rest,<br> everything must be pleasant for him<br> until he goes away.<br> I will try to live until then.<br> - Digging in?<br> - Oh, hello, Drake.<br> Something like that, I guess.<br> What are you doing way out here?<br> Oh, got a note from your sweetheart.<br> Cupid's messenger, that's me.<br> Thanks.<br> What's the matter?<br> Something gone wrong<br> between you and old Cass?<br> Something's going to happen, Drake.<br> Something bad, I don't know what.<br> It's just a feeling I've had lately.<br> Something I can't stop happening,<br> that maybe I'm even responsible for<br> in some way.<br> She wants to see me<br> at your house again tonight.<br> Well, don't you want to?<br> I wouldn't say this to anyone else, Drake.<br> Ever since we were kids,<br> there's been no one but her.<br> Gee, I had no idea.<br> Well, then everything<br> ought to be hunky-dory.<br> Oh, I get it. Her old man.<br> No, no,<br> there's something more to it than that.<br> Some mystery about Cassie herself.<br> Dr. Tower said something once,<br> "Each of us live in multiple worlds."<br> It's like that with her.<br> Say, you're getting to be<br> a regular philosopher.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I've learnt a lot from Dr. Tower, though.<br> - Not enough yet, I guess.<br> - He's crazy, isn't he?<br> No, he's brainier than the rest of men<br> in this town put together.<br> Well, there's something crazy<br> about that house.<br> I feel like a dog when I go there now.<br> I like him, Drake.<br> Yet, when I think about Cassie<br> and the way he makes her live...<br> Gosh, I'm all mixed up.<br> - Come in, Parris.<br> - Good afternoon, sir.<br> Something on your mind?<br> Dr. Tower, I'm going to ask you a question<br> perhaps you won't like answering.<br> - Then I shan't answer it.<br> - Is Dr. Gordon a good doctor?<br> Not a very a tactful question, young man,<br> nor a very ethical one<br> for a young doctor-to-be to ask.<br> Ever since I can remember<br> I've noticed things.<br> When I was just a kid,<br> there was Willy MacIntosh's father<br> who died from shock<br> during an operation without anesthetic.<br> There have been other cases,<br> Ludie Simms.<br> You know the widow<br> the men all wink about?<br> Dr. Gordon operated on her,<br> now one whole side of her face<br> is horribly paralyzed.<br> There've been others.<br> Now he's attending my grandmother.<br> I can assure you<br> that in your grandmother's case<br> he knows his business.<br> I'm glad to hear you say that, sir.<br> - Trust my judgment, do you?<br> - I know you know.<br> Maybe you're a fool, Parris Mitchell.<br> - Like a cup of coffee, my boy?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Parris, I began this work with you<br> with decided misgivings.<br> It's only fair to tell you now<br> that I've enjoyed it.<br> - Let the devil take the hindmost, eh?<br> - I guess I'll have to, sir.<br> Oh, it's not too bad<br> a philosophy sometimes.<br> - Hope you like your coffee black.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Oh, have you read this?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I didn't understand it entirely, I'm afraid.<br> Well, it's a new field.<br> They've even a new word for it:<br> psychiatry.<br> It's something I never thought about.<br> I mean, for a doctor<br> to want to cure diseases<br> of people's minds instead of their bodies.<br> - I suppose it a pretty big field, sir.<br> - Maybe too big.<br> Maybe a hundred years off.<br> Of course, one never knows.<br> There's a stir in Vienna now.<br> I don't want to push you<br> one way or the other,<br> but if you are interested,<br> I have some other material.<br> You had medieval history<br> in school this year, didn't you, Parris?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You should pay some attention<br> to 12th and 13th centuries.<br> A man's discomfort, his real discomfort<br> in this world began not long after then.<br> - But I always...<br> - Oh, I know, soap.<br> Macadamized roads,<br> dentistry and freedom of speech.<br> - Yes, yes, sir.<br> - Negligible factors.<br> In the 13th century, man was happier<br> and more comfortable in his world<br> than he is now.<br> I'm speaking of psychic man<br> and his relation with his whole universe.<br> I get it, sir. Everything was so simple then.<br> That was it, Parris. That was it.<br> But now, in this modern,<br> complicated world,<br> man breaks down under the strain,<br> the bewilderment,<br> disappointment and disillusionment.<br> He gets lost, goes crazy, commits suicide.<br> I don't know what's going to happen<br> to this world<br> in the next hundred years or so,<br> but I can guarantee you<br> life isn't going to get any simpler.<br> Worry and doubt bring on a belly-ache.<br> Mankind's building up<br> the biggest psychic belly-ache in history.<br> I'd better stop this.<br> I seem to be in a vein of<br> epigrammatic sententiousness today.<br> I was thinking, as you were talking...<br> No, I don't guess I better say it.<br> Go ahead, there's no one listening but me.<br> Well, you were saying that man gets lost.<br> It seems to me that these lost people<br> have kind of fooled themselves<br> clear out of the world of reality.<br> And the right way<br> is to fool them right back in again,<br> like catching a rabbit<br> that's strayed out of its pen.<br> You get his attention on something else<br> and he doesn't see the gate<br> and the first thing he knows<br> he's back home again.<br> Did you read that phrase somewhere?<br> "Back home again in the pen"?<br> No, sir. I must have made it up.<br> It won't surprise me, young man,<br> if you become a good doctor.<br> Maybe even a brilliant one.<br> Now, you run along home<br> and I'll get these entrance applications<br> off to Vienna.<br> I've enjoyed this afternoon very much, sir.<br> I like your politeness, Parris.<br> You're a credit to your grandmother.<br> And you're going to be a credit to me, too.<br> I'll try to be, sir.<br> If I had a son, I'd want him to be<br> as nearly like you as possible.<br> Yeah, yeah, that is good.<br> That is better than you know, Parris.<br> Such a waste of talent<br> for you to become a doctor.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Anna, how is she today?<br> - The same.<br> The weather will be cooler soon.<br> If you'll excuse me, Professor Berdorff,<br> - I don't feel like finishing.<br> - Yeah.<br> Dr. Gordon came here twice today.<br> Anna.<br> - How long has this been necessary?<br> - How stupid, I left it.<br> Anna?<br> For several weeks, Parris.<br> - Cancer?<br> - Yes, Parris.<br> Why wasn't I told? Why have I been<br> kept out of this like a child?<br> Madam wished it.<br> She wanted you to finish your studies<br> without worrying.<br> She made me promise.<br> She thought<br> she would live through September.<br> And she won't? Is that what you mean?<br> It's impossible that she could live<br> more than a few days.<br> - Only a few days?<br> - Yes, Parris.<br> Parris.<br> Oh, Parris, I had to see you.<br> Weren't you scared here<br> in the dark by yourself?<br> A little. You know I wouldn't have<br> telephoned just now<br> - if it wasn't important.<br> - Well, let's go back to your house?<br> No, I had to get out of the house tonight,<br> I couldn't stand it.<br> - Cassie, what's the matter?<br> - Can't we just walk here in the trees?<br> I never realize how little you are<br> till I walk with you.<br> Oh, you've just gotten to be awfully tall.<br> It seems a long time ago since<br> we walked home this way from school.<br> Look, Parris, the pond.<br> I'd forgotten how lovely it was.<br> You know something?<br> I used to think of this as our secret lake.<br> So did I.<br> How odd it is that we should both...<br> Or perhaps it isn't odd at all.<br> You'll be going away pretty soon now.<br> Yes, I guess so.<br> I'll miss you.<br> Will you really, Cassie?<br> So much I don't know<br> what will become of me.<br> - I adore you, Cassie.<br> - Don't.<br> Even now,<br> don't say anything you don't mean.<br> I don't even know how I feel about you.<br> I haven't known<br> since the day you came to our house<br> and I opened the door.<br> I know I just never think of anyone else<br> but you, but...<br> - Why whenever I ask...<br> - I didn't come here to be questioned.<br> - I can't understand you. Sometimes...<br> - Don't talk about it, please.<br> - You said you had something to tell me.<br> - Did I?<br> Parris.<br> You know I wouldn't do<br> anything to hurt you, don't you?<br> - What is it that frightens you?<br> - It's...<br> - I'm...<br> - Tell me.<br> I don't think<br> they're treating you right, Parris.<br> That's it.<br> Parris, your grandmother is dying<br> and they don't tell you.<br> I thought you ought to know.<br> I was afraid of what the sudden shock<br> might've done to you.<br> Oh, darling!<br> I guess it's just as bad<br> the way I've told you.<br> No, no. It's all right, Cassie.<br> I knew.<br> I'm glad you wanted to tell me, though.<br> I just won't have anyone at all,<br> Cassie, when...<br> - I forget sometimes, how pretty you are.<br> - Oh, Parris.<br> - You're crying.<br> - Just a little bit, never mind.<br> But I do mind. I mind awfully.<br> Oh, why do you have things<br> happen to you?<br> Why do you have to cry?<br> You're the nicest, best.<br> Why do any of us have to cry?<br> You or me, what have we done?<br> Oh, I hate it. I hate everything.<br> I'd hate God if I could.<br> But there's nothing you can reach.<br> - Cassie.<br> - Don't. Don't say anything.<br> I want you to hate it, too,<br> whatever hurts us.<br> Oh, Parris, don't cry.<br> Please don't cry, I can't stand that.<br> Oh, darling! Darling, darling.<br> This may be the last time I can see you.<br> Cassie, listen to me.<br> I'm going away, but I'm coming back.<br> I want to be a good doctor,<br> a great one if I can.<br> When I come back, maybe somehow<br> the time will pass quickly.<br> When I come back, will you marry me?<br> - Cassie, don't you want to marry me?<br> - If I can let you understand.<br> - Maybe I do.<br> - No, you don't.<br> Not at all. You couldn't.<br> - Well, never mind, Cassie...<br> - Please, Parris.<br> Everything is perfect<br> until we try to talk about it.<br> Don't try to understand me.<br> But just be with me when you can, and...<br> Cassie?<br> - Parris, you are here.<br> - Yes, I...<br> I came for you at midnight<br> when Dr. Gordon left.<br> - Anna, is she...<br> - No.<br> Dr. Gordon said<br> he couldn't do anything more.<br> I thought maybe,<br> I hoped it would be over<br> before you came in.<br> You come now.<br> Anna, I can't help her.<br> No, no.<br> - Getting straightened around?<br> - Oh, hello, Drake.<br> Are you sure you don't mind<br> my storing all these books here?<br> I guess the old barn is big enough<br> to hold them.<br> It's been awfully good of you, Drake,<br> to take me in just now.<br> - I can't be any fun to be with.<br> - Well, it's like I always said,<br> you and me are in the same boat,<br> more than ever now.<br> There's something I've been meaning<br> to ask you for a long time, Drake.<br> You haven't said anything<br> about Louise Gordon in I don't know when.<br> Heck. I guess I'll marry<br> somebody like Poppy Ross.<br> - It's more fun anyways.<br> - You wouldn't do a thing like that.<br> No, I guess not.<br> Someday I'm gonna surprise<br> some of the people in this town.<br> When I get my money<br> I'm going into business.<br> Settle down hard, when I do settle down.<br> I'll make Louise proud of me<br> and then maybe she...<br> What's that?<br> - Cassie.<br> - Parris!<br> - Parris, I got to talk to you.<br> - If you two will excuse me.<br> Don't go. I've only a word to say.<br> You know all about us anyway.<br> You look... You look...<br> - How?<br> - You look scared.<br> - Parris, let me go away with you.<br> - Go away? You mean when I go to Europe?<br> Anywhere, anywhere, I don't care.<br> I'll run away somewhere.<br> Let me go with you, I can take care of you.<br> But we can't get married now.<br> I've got to get through all that study first.<br> - I asked you if, when I came back, you'd...<br> - Never mind.<br> Cassie, if you'd rather, I...<br> - It was a wicked idea. Forgive me.<br> - Wait a minute. Sit down.<br> - Tell me what happened.<br> - Nothing. Nothing at all. I must go.<br> - I'll take you home.<br> - No. No, you can't.<br> You've got to let me<br> talk to you now, Cassie.<br> You'd better let me<br> go part of the way anyhow.<br> Thank you, no. Good night.<br> - I'm going over there, Drake.<br> - Take it easy.<br> She said... Well, you heard her.<br> She didn't want you to come along.<br> She looked twice as scared<br> when you suggested it.<br> See there, nothing's happened.<br> He's sitting on the porch swing.<br> For half a cent I'd go in there.<br> That's just what I'm gonna do.<br> I'm gonna take her out<br> right in front of him.<br> We'll move out to my place.<br> You a farmer? You're gonna be a doctor.<br> It's what you've always wanted<br> and what your grandma planned.<br> - Kid, if I have to slug you...<br> - Let loose, Drake. I...<br> There.<br> Does that look like anything's happened?<br> Old Cass was just having a fit<br> about you going away, that's all.<br> All women and girls<br> act like that sometimes.<br> It doesn't mean a thing.<br> Just the same, Drake, I'm scared.<br> I don't know why.<br> What you need is some sleep.<br> You're worn out and nervous.<br> Come on home.<br> You can see Cassie tomorrow.<br> Just don't say anything to him about it.<br> Here, maybe I better take it up.<br> Are you awake, kid?<br> Here. Eat your breakfast.<br> - What's the idea of all the attention?<br> - Come on. Better eat this.<br> You all right, Drake?<br> I've got something to tell you,<br> but you gotta drink your coffee first.<br> Tell me now.<br> It's something about Cassie.<br> Cassie's dead.<br> She was killed early last night.<br> I guess shortly after we were there.<br> Who?<br> Her father killed her<br> and committed suicide.<br> - I don't believe it. You...<br> - Now, get a hold of yourself, kid.<br> I'll tell you everything I know.<br> I heard it first from Ester<br> when she came in early this morning<br> and I telephoned the Gazette<br> and confirmed it.<br> Cassie was poisoned.<br> Quite a bit later, Dr. Tower shot himself.<br> He hadn't been dead very long<br> when the cook came in and found them.<br> He left some kind of letter or letters.<br> I don't know which, the Gazette said.<br> I'm going over now<br> and see what I can find out.<br> Yes, that's it, Drake. We've got to go.<br> You're not going<br> if I have to tie you in the cellar.<br> - I've got to.<br> - Listen, you fool.<br> Cassie was here last night.<br> We were probably the last people<br> who saw her alive.<br> If you won't think about yourself<br> I should think<br> you'd at least want to protect her.<br> - Protect her, Drake? I think I've killed her...<br> - Yeah.<br> You say that out loud a few times<br> and somebody'll believe you.<br> Then where'll your future in this town<br> be shot to?<br> - I don't care.<br> - Listen, kid, I know how you feel.<br> I know what you'd like to do,<br> but just let me go first. That's all I ask.<br> I'll come back and tell you everything.<br> Then you can do<br> whatever you feel is right.<br> - Hey, McHugh.<br> - Friend of the family.<br> - Find anything more?<br> - Not yet.<br> Darndest mystery.<br> Hello, Sam.<br> Good afternoon, Colonel Skeffington.<br> Well, what do you want here, Drake?<br> This is no time...<br> Wait a minute, Sam.<br> Just as well you came by.<br> Where's Parris Mitchell?<br> Still at your house?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Ask him to be kind enough to wait there<br> till I can see him.<br> - May I ask why, sir?<br> - I want to talk to him.<br> He isn't the one you want to talk to.<br> What's that?<br> Anything new?<br> Just something about the girl.<br> You mean her having her things packed<br> ready to skedaddle.<br> Tell you later.<br> What were you about to say?<br> When you say that Parris is not the one<br> we should talk to,<br> you imply there's someone else.<br> I guess I mean me.<br> - Do you know something about this affair?<br> - I knew Cassie Tower.<br> I just heard you say<br> her things were packed.<br> Well, we were going to run away.<br> She'd been getting out to meet me<br> for a long time.<br> - Do I have to say anything more?<br> - Did Dr. Tower know anything about this?<br> I guess I wouldn't be here today if he had.<br> Pretty lucky.<br> But I don't know anything about this crime<br> or whatever you call it.<br> And if you want to put me on the stand<br> I'll even lie about what I just told you.<br> - Is it all right if I go now?<br> - I guess it is. Nothing to hold you on.<br> Why did you come here to tell us this?<br> I just wanted to relieve your mind, sir.<br> You won't need to talk to Parris now,<br> will you?<br> Looks like you jumped<br> to the wrong conclusion, Drake.<br> All I wanted to see Parris for<br> was to tell him about this letter<br> that Dr. Tower wrote.<br> He left his property,<br> everything he owned to Parris.<br> He what?<br> Well, it appears you weren't so lucky<br> as you thought you were.<br> If he'd know about<br> his prospective son-in-law<br> he might have left it to you.<br> I guess I'll go now, sir.<br> Funny thing. I sort of like that boy.<br> Bold as brass.<br> But he is the only young man in town<br> beside Parris Mitchell<br> who has grace enough<br> to say sir to his elders.<br> - Now, for Pete's sake, please...<br> - Why, Drake? Why did it happen?<br> Why did Cassie come here last night?<br> What was she afraid of?<br> What happened since the other night<br> when I saw her?<br> What reason could her father have had<br> for killing her?<br> What reason could he have had<br> for killing himself?<br> Why didn't Cassie explain things<br> last night?<br> Why did Dr. Tower leave me his property?<br> Why should anyone wanna kill Cassie,<br> who never did any harm to anyone?<br> Why?<br> Say, do you know it's<br> the middle of the night?<br> Sit down, Drake.<br> Sure, what's up?<br> I think I know...<br> I do know why Dr. Tower<br> killed Cassie and himself.<br> Sure enough?<br> You've got to promise me<br> this'll be a secret between us, Drake.<br> Of course.<br> Drake, do you remember<br> Mrs. Tower very well?<br> Cassie's mother?<br> A little, when we were kids.<br> How she used to stay inside all the time<br> just up in her window looking out?<br> Sure. Everybody thought she was loco.<br> How do you feel<br> about people like that, Drake?<br> Do we have to talk about it now?<br> How do you feel<br> about somebody who gets a bad heart,<br> or something wrong with their legs<br> or their hands or their eyes?<br> Well, things like that,<br> that aren't their fault...<br> That's the way I feel about people who<br> get something wrong with their brains.<br> Say, are you trying to tell me Dr. Tower...<br> - You know, kid, I always did tell you...<br> - There's a note here near the beginning<br> that says, "Today, I noticed<br> the first sign in Cassandra."<br> - Do you mean that she... That Cassie...<br> - Not so you could notice it.<br> No more, I suppose,<br> when Mrs. Tower was<br> when D. Tower fell in love with her<br> and married her.<br> - Our own Cassie?<br> - They were just the first indications,<br> the early maladjustments<br> of dementia praecox.<br> Hey, you sound like a doctor already.<br> I certainly don't feel like one.<br> - Well, we won't talk about it anymore...<br> - No, I'd rather.<br> - Drake, I think Dr. Tower knew about us.<br> - About you and Cassie?<br> But, do you think that she knew?<br> About herself, I mean.<br> Yes, I'm sure she did.<br> That's why whenever I asked her<br> questions about us<br> I could never pin her down.<br> What about the night<br> she came to ask you to take her away?<br> She wasn't pinned down then.<br> A kind of final desperation, I guess.<br> I don't know what Dr. Tower knew<br> about that night. Maybe nothing.<br> Maybe he guessed.<br> Maybe he was just looking into my future.<br> - I don't quite follow you, kid.<br> - He was a brilliant doctor, Drake.<br> Why did he come<br> to a little town here like Kings Row<br> and bury himself<br> while he was still pretty young?<br> You mean Mrs. Tower?<br> He didn't want that to happen to me<br> that happened to him...<br> Stop his career.<br> He thought more of me<br> than I ever knew, Drake.<br> Listen, Parris.<br> Let's burn this book up<br> and nobody will ever know but ourselves.<br> No, Drake.<br> We're not going to burn it.<br> I'm going to study this book.<br> - I'm tired now.<br> - Sure, kid. I'll get the light.<br> Drake, I'm going now as quickly as I can.<br> I've had about<br> as much as I can take, I think.<br> And you just stay out of the house<br> until it's sold.<br> Anything you want there,<br> anything at all, just take it.<br> Let the rest of the stuff go.<br> Write to me.<br> If there's ever anytime you need me,<br> my Liebchen, I will...<br> I know, Anna, I know that.<br> Hello, Drake McHugh.<br> Why, hello, Randy Monaghan.<br> Say, I haven't seen you in a long while.<br> You never did come back<br> to Elroy's icehouse. Going away?<br> - Hello, Randy.<br> - Hello, Parris.<br> Parris is going away.<br> He's going clear to Europe.<br> Sure enough? Gonna stay long?<br> I don't know.<br> I haven't felt like making plans.<br> - I think I'll just let things happen.<br> - He'll be back.<br> I heard your grandmother died, Parris.<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Say, Randy, I'll bet<br> you're the prettiest girl in the world.<br> Here she comes.<br> - Gosh.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I hate to see that boy go away.<br> He's the best friend I've got.<br> - He's a nice boy, isn't he?<br> - Very best.<br> There he goes.<br> Four or five years. Gosh.<br> Say, I have my buggy down here.<br> How about coming for a ride<br> out in the country?<br> All right, let's.<br> Oh, wait a minute. Bread and butter.<br> Have you ever seen a prettier day?<br> Whoa, there, Tom Thumb.<br> What's the hurry?<br> - Why do you call him Tom Thumb, Drake?<br> - Because he's so big.<br> - That makes sense.<br> - My kind of sense.<br> That's what I mean.<br> - I got him trained.<br> - I see.<br> - He knows just what I want him to do.<br> - I guess he's had plenty of training, too.<br> - You mean, going on by himself? Sure.<br> - Why?<br> For this.<br> I'm as bright as the horse,<br> but not so well trained.<br> Oh, gee, Randy. I'm so lonely and blue.<br> Be nice to me, will you?<br> Maybe you got me confused<br> with one of the Ross girls.<br> Well, what's the harm in a little kiss?<br> A kiss?<br> Suppose we find out?<br> - No, no, wait a minute.<br> - Hey.<br> Happy new century, dummy.<br> This is it, honey.<br> Did you bring me way up here in the wind<br> just to look at scenery?<br> But I'm going to buy all this<br> with Peyton Graves<br> - when I come into my money.<br> - What for?<br> Just something I dreamed up.<br> A subdivision.<br> Can you imagine what it would be like<br> to have houses up here?<br> - Yes. It'd be windy.<br> - Oh, shut up. It isn't windy all the time.<br> But, Drake, only rich people could<br> build houses like you're talking about.<br> - Well, we'd sell them to rich people.<br> - How many are there in Kings Row?<br> What do you<br> want to throw cold water for?<br> Would you like me to show you<br> what I think would be a good idea?<br> - Where to?<br> - The lowlands, down by the creek.<br> The other side of the railroad track.<br> My side.<br> You mean here?<br> Isn't it delicious?<br> It stirs you up, doesn't it?<br> - I mean...<br> - Yes, honey. I know what you mean.<br> - Well, doesn't it?<br> - Yes, I guess it does. But, Drake...<br> Now you're fixing<br> to yell at me about something.<br> No, I was just kind of wondering.<br> Most everything stirs you up, doesn't it?<br> This, the smell of wild plum blossoms,<br> the sunlight or the moonlight<br> or morning or noon or night.<br> Just anything.<br> - But mostly you.<br> - So you say.<br> Honest.<br> - Let's get out and walk. It looks so pretty.<br> - You bet.<br> Drake McHugh,<br> you make me awfully mad sometimes.<br> Oh, now,<br> one of the nicest things about you, honey,<br> - is that you don't pretend anything.<br> - Well, I don't pretend.<br> Well then, what are we talking about?<br> Well, for instance, right now.<br> I suggested we walk down here.<br> - All right, what's wrong with that?<br> - Right away you thought...<br> - What?<br> - Well, all the time<br> I only wanted to tell you my idea.<br> Go ahead and tell me. I'm listening.<br> I will. And it's not a bad one either.<br> If you want to buy real estate,<br> why don't you buy this?<br> - This junk?<br> - Well, it could be cleared and drained.<br> After all, there are a lots of people<br> who work in the clay pits,<br> in the mills and the coal mines<br> who'd like to own homes, too.<br> - A lot of nickels and dimes...<br> - Make dollars.<br> I don't see how any one so pretty<br> could be so practical.<br> Remember once you came down<br> to Elroy's icehouse<br> and you and Parris and I played on<br> the rings?<br> I was an awful little toughy then, wasn't I?<br> Oh, yes. I was.<br> But you teased me, you tried to get fresh.<br> - I was an awful kid, I guess.<br> - Yes, you were.<br> But I think I got mad mostly that day<br> because Parris was there.<br> I liked him a whole lot better<br> than I did you...<br> then.<br> - You're sure of that now?<br> - What do you think?<br> When a girls acts the way I do about you,<br> she means it.<br> It's because I want to.<br> Because I like you<br> better than anybody in the world.<br> Serious as all that?<br> Nothing is serious to us<br> in the whole world, is it?<br> - Hey!<br> - Oh, Drake, my new hat!<br> No, my new hat.<br> Louise. Louise.<br> - Yes, what do you want?<br> - Your father would hear of this.<br> What are you crying about?<br> - Does it make any difference?<br> - Don't answer me like that.<br> Why can't you let me alone?<br> Because I don't want you sitting up here<br> crying like a little fool over nothing.<br> - Nothing.<br> - Oh, I know what you're crying about.<br> I saw Drake McHugh going by<br> with that little nobody from downtown.<br> - Aren't you ashamed of yourself?<br> - For what?<br> - For letting her take him away from me?<br> - Louise,<br> you know what I mean.<br> Haven't you got any self-respect?<br> No.<br> Well, I almost believe you.<br> If he wants to run around<br> with that kind of trash...<br> You know what boys are like.<br> Your father is a doctor.<br> - If you knew all I know...<br> - I don't want to hear it!<br> You can be sure when a boy runs around<br> with a girl like that, it is for just...<br> I wish it was me.<br> What did you say?<br> I said, I wish it was me.<br> I wish it was me! I wish it was me!<br> - Hi, Randy.<br> - Hello, Ed.<br> - Oh, let me out here, Drake.<br> - Why?<br> Why can't I ever let you out<br> at your front door?<br> It's late, and Pa and my brother Tod<br> will be home.<br> - I'm not good enough even for...<br> - Drake,<br> you were just going to say, "Even for me."<br> I wasn't either.<br> I was going to say, "Even for them."<br> They don't think I'm good enough for you.<br> Now, hold your temper.<br> We're not a fitting match.<br> You belong up on Union Street.<br> Your family was rich and high-toned.<br> My Pa's a railroad section boss...<br> Oh, if you're gonna start that bunk<br> about class again.<br> Why did you drive by<br> the Gordon's just now?<br> Well...<br> It's on the way home.<br> Even when it isn't, you do.<br> Didn't you go around with Louise<br> for a while?<br> Yeah. Her old man thought I was wild.<br> So you came downtown.<br> Anything south of the railroad tracks.<br> Randy, you know that's not so.<br> - Do you ever think of Louise anymore?<br> - Sometimes.<br> - What do you think?<br> - I get mad.<br> Anything else?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Thanks, Drake.<br> - For what?<br> - For being that honest.<br> When a boy who belongs uptown<br> begins taking a girl from the lower end<br> of town out buggy riding at night,<br> people talk. You know that, don't you?<br> I'll say. Gabble, gabble, gabble. I'd like<br> to hear them to my face sometime.<br> Well, we can't honestly blame them<br> for saying something that's so, can we?<br> Oh, Randy, for Pete's sake.<br> Well, just saying, "For Pete's sake,"<br> doesn't clear up anything.<br> What's got to be cleared up?<br> Just why Pa doesn't want me<br> to go with you.<br> I guess Ma wouldn't either,<br> if she was still living.<br> I'll go with you as long as you want me to.<br> But don't get mad<br> when I try and clear up how things are.<br> If I married you, that'd shut their traps.<br> - I wouldn't marry you, Drake.<br> - What?<br> - Surprised, aren't you?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> Well, that's the way it is.<br> I'll go on this way, but no other way.<br> Remember that, will you?<br> This where you want to get out?<br> - Goodbye, Drake.<br> - Bye, honey.<br> - Hello, sis.<br> - There you are.<br> I didn't mean to be so late.<br> Here, Pa, I'll take over.<br> - Oh, well, it won't hurt us for once.<br> - Go on, sit down. I'll put it on the table.<br> Fixed that kink<br> in the third section today, sis.<br> - Fixed her straight and true as a die.<br> - That's the stuff, Tod.<br> When Pa retires<br> and I get to be section boss...<br> Drake!<br> Mr. Monaghan, I'm Drake McHugh.<br> Maybe you've heard about me.<br> Be a wonder if you haven't,<br> the way people gab.<br> And most of what they say is true.<br> But the one thing they can't say is that<br> I ever do anything behind anyone's back.<br> Well, I've been taking your daughter out<br> buggy riding.<br> I like her and she likes me.<br> But I won't do anything on the sly.<br> So if you've got any objection<br> to my going on seeing her,<br> now is the time to spit it out.<br> Why, no, no, no.<br> Now, what have you got to say?<br> Won't you sit down<br> and have some supper?<br> - You wanted to see me, Mr. Lawes?<br> - Oh, yes, McHugh.<br> Come in and sit down.<br> It's about your account.<br> It's overdrawn a little, you know?<br> Naturally, the way you tear around.<br> But I thought I had more than $1,000<br> in my account.<br> - How could you be that far off?<br> - I don't know. Can I talk to Mr. Curley?<br> Mr. Curley's in Texas.<br> Down there on business.<br> I don't expect him back until next week.<br> Well, I haven't been spending any money.<br> Not much.<br> Last July there must have been<br> about $1,000 put in.<br> The regular quarterly installment.<br> Is that so?<br> Just a minute.<br> - There wasn't any deposit made in July.<br> - Are you sure?<br> Nothing since the 2nd of April.<br> And the bonds and estate papers<br> are in Mr. Curley's own box, I suppose?<br> That's where he always kept them.<br> - Bring the keys.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Don't say anything about this to anyone<br> until we're sure.<br> - Not to anyone.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Why, Drake.<br> Come in, come in.<br> I'd like to talk to you<br> for a little while, Mr. Monaghan.<br> Is Randy here?<br> I don't want her to see me<br> looking like this.<br> - I just want to talk to you.<br> - She's upstairs.<br> I was just puttering around here.<br> Never know<br> what to do with myself Sundays.<br> When Ma was alive we'd sit and talk.<br> How about a cup of coffee?<br> No, thanks.<br> The constable gave me some coffee.<br> I got drunk at Fritz Bachman's last night.<br> Sam Winters came along<br> and hauled me to jail<br> just in time to keep me<br> from getting kicked out to freeze.<br> Fritz Bachman, lowlife skunk.<br> Well, I didn't have to go there<br> and get drunk.<br> No, you didn't. To tell you the truth, son,<br> I've been meaning to talk to you<br> for some time.<br> You won't need to.<br> I gave myself a talking to this morning<br> when I woke up in jail<br> with three other guests of the town.<br> I want a job, Mr. Monaghan.<br> Can you get me a job at the railroad?<br> I've got no place<br> on the section gang, Drake.<br> I guess I will have some coffee, please.<br> Look at me, Mr. Monaghan.<br> I look like a tramp.<br> I'll be a tramp,<br> if somebody doesn't give me a job.<br> - I've tried everybody in town.<br> - Drake?<br> - Oh, Drake, you look like...<br> - I know how I look.<br> Like I was in the calaboose all night<br> for being drunk.<br> Oh, Drake.<br> You know what people around town<br> are saying about you and me?<br> No.<br> They're saying that you're gonna<br> give me the gate any day now.<br> It's nice of them<br> to make up my mind for me.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.<br> I'll come to if you'll just be patient<br> and give me a little time<br> to get over being confused.<br> Trouble is, I've never had to think<br> about money all my life.<br> Just counted on having it, and now...<br> - Drake wants me to get him a job.<br> - Oh?<br> I'll talk to Mr. Turner.<br> Maybe he'll give you a job in the yards.<br> Switchman or flagman or something.<br> It means being out in all kinds of weather.<br> It won't break your back<br> but it's work and no mistake.<br> What are your toney friends<br> up on Union Street going to say?<br> I'll get you a job, son.<br> You can depend on me.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> If you do, I'll sell my place uptown.<br> I'm coming down here somewhere to live.<br> - Pretty rough.<br> - My friends are down here.<br> Well, I'm going home now and clean up.<br> If I can come back later...<br> You stay here now.<br> Go on up to Tod's room<br> and I'll bring you some hot water<br> and you can wash and shave.<br> I'll fix you something to eat.<br> Then you're going to bed<br> and get some sleep.<br> Bossy redhead, isn't she?<br> - You know something, Randy?<br> - What, Pa?<br> When you was my little tomboy daughter,<br> I used to wonder how you'd turn out.<br> I shouldn't ought to have worried.<br> "Baltimore and Ohio."<br> "Chesapeake and Illinois."<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Coffee, mister?<br> Say, you shouldn't be out<br> on a night like this.<br> I had to keep the railroad running.<br> - Besides, I've got news.<br> - So have I, come to think of it.<br> Thanks, honey.<br> Now, which news first?<br> - Yours. I already know mine.<br> - Well,<br> Pa heard this afternoon<br> that you're going to get a promotion.<br> Sure enough?<br> Mr. Turner's finally become convinced<br> that your intentions are good.<br> So, he's making you an assistant<br> in the freight office with a raise of $2.<br> You're climbing up, my friend.<br> Twenty or 30 years like that<br> and I'll be somewhere, won't I?<br> - What's your news?<br> - Oh, I got a letter from Parris.<br> - Oh, how is he?<br> - Fine. Hopes I'm the same.<br> Wants to hear all the news in Kings Row.<br> "Dear Drake, glad to hear<br> that you're feeling good<br> "and everything is going so..."<br> I'll skip that.<br> - "Of course..."<br> - Why haven't you ever told Parris?<br> About your bad luck, I mean.<br> - Think that's why I got a friend?<br> - I love your beautiful pride, darling.<br> "Of course, I'm cramming like blazes<br> for final examinations right now.<br> "Just think, graduation in June.<br> "I've definitely decided<br> what I'm going to do with my life, Drake.<br> "I'm going to be a... I'm going to be a...<br> "A psychiatrist." What does that mean?<br> Don't ask me, I'm one of the illiterate.<br> "I think you'll understand why,<br> remembering Cassandra.<br> "I guess I'll be the first..."<br> Well, here's it is again.<br> "In Kings Row and maybe in America."<br> Oh, you could trust Parris to be the first.<br> Here, take it home and finish it.<br> Gee, I'm sorry I sold the house<br> even if I did get $400.<br> - Why sorry?<br> - Well, if Parris comes home this summer<br> he could've stayed with me.<br> Still living on the other side<br> of the railroad tracks, aren't you?<br> Oh, Parris isn't that kind.<br> He's not Kings Row at all.<br> No, I didn't mean that.<br> What did you mean?<br> Just you, I guess.<br> I've been kind of wondering...<br> Well, tonight's the Skeffington party<br> and I know you were invited.<br> - Are you sorry you're not there?<br> - Not by a long shot.<br> Most of Kings Row has forgotten me<br> and I can forget them.<br> You know, it's funny<br> how things have changed with us.<br> We used to be so...<br> Well, so excited all the time.<br> All breathlessness<br> and one joke on top of another.<br> Now, we gotten used to each other,<br> I guess.<br> Sometimes when we're together<br> and you're in a mood,<br> you don't talk for hours at a time,<br> I wonder if you even know I'm with you.<br> I don't want it to be that way.<br> You're all there is.<br> Even when I'm not with you for a minute<br> I get all jumpy and lost.<br> I know, darling.<br> I'm happier than anyone has a right to be.<br> I hope you get to be, too.<br> - Like some more coffee?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Well, maybe you'll want some later.<br> Be sure and bring the kettle home,<br> will you?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'll wait up to say goodnight.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye, honey.<br> So long, fellas!<br> Look out!<br> Quick, Dutch, there's been an accident.<br> Get Doc Gordon as quick as you can.<br> Quick, Drake McHugh has been run over.<br> - Run over? Drake?<br> - Don't stand there, get the doctor.<br> Oh, Henry, do you have to leave the party?<br> There's been an accident, Drake McHugh.<br> - Drake McHugh?<br> - Yes, crushed by a freight car.<br> - What's happened to Drake?<br> - Nothing that concerns you, Louise.<br> Where is he? I'm going with you.<br> You'll do nothing of the kind.<br> You can't keep me away from him,<br> not anymore.<br> - Harriet.<br> - Now, Louise.<br> - Take your hands off me.<br> - Louise.<br> I'll go to him and I'll stay with him!<br> And nothing you could do or say<br> can stop me.<br> - Henry! Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> - It's all right, Colonel.<br> I've just heard about young McHugh.<br> - You want me to come with you?<br> - No, no, no, stay with your guests.<br> Keep her here.<br> - I'm going.<br> - Louise, Louise, people will hear.<br> Now, be quiet.<br> - I'll have to have some help.<br> - What you gonna do, Doc?<br> Someone, you, Davis, get me<br> some blankets and a half a dozen sheets,<br> anywhere here in the neighborhood,<br> and be quick.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Can you heat some water<br> on the stove, Dutch?<br> - Sure.<br> - I'll help, Doc, tell me what you want.<br> All right, Sam, I'll need somebody steady.<br> Now, everybody else get out.<br> - What do you want me to do first?<br> - Cut his clothes off.<br> Someone stand at that door<br> and keep everybody out.<br> I'll do that, sir, and I'll keep them out.<br> And when you're finished,<br> we can take him across to my house,<br> it's just a few steps.<br> - Good, pull those shades down.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Now, Sam, let's see.<br> - What'll have to be done, Doc?<br> - Amputation.<br> - His leg? Which one?<br> - Both.<br> There's just a chance.<br> - Father.<br> - Party over?<br> - Where's your mother?<br> - I got out. I said I would.<br> I stood it as long as I could,<br> then I went down to the railroad.<br> - You had no business there.<br> - You had just left.<br> They'd carried Drake away somewhere.<br> A terrible old man<br> was cleaning up the depot where...<br> That will do.<br> It was most unbecoming of you<br> to go about parading your feelings,<br> whatever you think they are.<br> - Father.<br> - What do you want to say?<br> - You monster, you fiend!<br> - Louise!<br> I'll let the world know what you are,<br> if it's the only thing I ever do.<br> Tomorrow... Tomorrow, I'll tell everyone.<br> I know what you are.<br> I know all about you and your operations!<br> You're going to bed at once.<br> - I will not, I'm going to tell.<br> - Louise, listen to me,<br> I cannot permit my daughter<br> to make an hysterical spectacle of herself.<br> Now, go to your room<br> and don't you come out of it again<br> until you have my permission.<br> I will tell, I will tell, I will tell. I'll tell them!<br> This is enough of your willful tantrum.<br> If you persist,<br> there's one thing I shall have to do.<br> - What?<br> - If you utter one more word<br> of the kind of nonsense<br> I've heard from you,<br> I shall commit you to an asylum.<br> You wouldn't dare.<br> I've only to go to that telephone<br> in the hall there and have you in a cell,<br> behind bars in one hour.<br> - I'm not crazy and you know it.<br> - I don't know anything of the sort.<br> You mean, you actually think...<br> You really...<br> I could think nothing else<br> when you make these insane accusations.<br> - I'll go.<br> - That's better.<br> And stay in your room<br> until I say you can come out.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Can you make out for an hour or two<br> until the night nurse comes on?<br> - Yes, I know what to do.<br> - Good night, then.<br> You ought to go out for some fresh air.<br> I've got to be here when he finds out.<br> Sit down and have some supper, child.<br> Please drink some coffee.<br> You haven't slept for three nights.<br> He's going to get well,<br> the doctor promised that.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> Even if he does get well,<br> how is he going to make out now.<br> I wish you wouldn't talk about it.<br> I want you to hear what I've got to say.<br> You want to keep Drake here, don't you?<br> That's what you want, ain't it, Randy?<br> - Randy.<br> - Yes, Tod?<br> He's waking up, I think.<br> Did the doctor say to give him<br> another injection this evening?<br> - No, I'll go to him and talk...<br> - Randy wants to keep Drake here.<br> Gee, that's fine.<br> You got to have somebody<br> to look after him.<br> Oh, Randy, what's the matter, sis?<br> Drake hasn't got any money.<br> Almost none, anyway.<br> - Money?<br> - Yes, he's just got a few dollars.<br> Well, he don't need any, does he?<br> Oh, sis.<br> Randy! Randy!<br> Randy! Where's the rest of me?<br> - Drake.<br> - Randy!<br> Yes, Drake?<br> It was that accident.<br> Yes, dear, but don't talk about it, yet.<br> Parris.<br> - Herr Mitchell.<br> - Dr. Candell just sent for me.<br> Letter came for you, special delivery,<br> thought it might be important.<br> Thanks, Heinrich.<br> Come in.<br> - Good afternoon, Mitchell.<br> - Good afternoon, sir.<br> - I beg your pardon, letter from home.<br> - Home?<br> That's some little hamlet<br> in North America, I believe.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Care to read it?<br> - Oh, no, later.<br> Mitchell, we've liked your work here.<br> It may please you to know<br> that you will graduate<br> with one of the best records<br> of our recent history.<br> Really, sir?<br> Another thing may please you.<br> At least, I hope it does.<br> I've been talking to some of the others.<br> We plan to expand our<br> department of Psychiatric Research here.<br> It gives us satisfaction<br> to offer you a post with us.<br> Me?<br> Of course,<br> if you want time to think it over.<br> - No indeed, you might change your minds.<br> - Good.<br> You begin immediately. The summer term.<br> And, if you care to celebrate tonight,<br> they say that that new dancer<br> at the Hotel Crillon is divine.<br> Drake.<br> This first sentence.<br> "You and Randy stick together<br> until I get there."<br> Yes, I know it by heart.<br> Of course, he doesn't understand<br> I haven't any money.<br> Even selling the house<br> is only a few hundred dollars.<br> So?<br> Oh, for Pete's sake, Randy,<br> I can't ever earn anymore.<br> So, I thought...<br> Well, I remembered that<br> if you have just a little money that...<br> Well, I've heard there are homes<br> that you can get into.<br> Drake McHugh.<br> Don't do that, Randy, I'd be all right.<br> I'm going to see to it that you are.<br> Listen, Drake,<br> I didn't ask to come into your life, did I?<br> No.<br> All right, but then you owe me something.<br> You owe me yourself.<br> - Drake, are you all right?<br> - Yes.<br> I guess I don't get it through my head<br> just what you want.<br> I want you to trust yourself entirely to me<br> for a while, until you're up and around...<br> You see, honey,<br> I can't ever be up and around.<br> What has happened is terrible,<br> but you're alive.<br> - That's a lot of good.<br> - You're alive and I love you.<br> I'm going to tell you something,<br> and I want you to listen until I've finished.<br> Then you can talk if you want to,<br> but I want my say first.<br> It's first of all, what Parris said there<br> in the cablegram.<br> "You and Randy stick together<br> until I get there."<br> We're going to do that,<br> but I'd made up my mind about it<br> a long time before this happened.<br> Then after you got hurt,<br> I just had to figure out how, that was all.<br> Remember once you said something<br> about marrying me?<br> Well, I got mad<br> because I guess I'd been a little hurt.<br> I knew you'd never thought about it<br> until just then.<br> Then I shouldn't be blaming you<br> even that much.<br> You never thought about much of anything<br> in those days until you had to.<br> Then, later on you came down here.<br> Remember the morning<br> you came to ask Pa to help you get a job?<br> Well, I made up my mind that day<br> that I'd marry you,<br> as soon as the right time came around.<br> I guess I was convinced inside by then<br> that you did wanna marry me.<br> I knew I wanted to marry you...<br> - Randy, for Pete's sake, I...<br> - Hush, you were to listen.<br> So, now the right time has come.<br> We'll get married,<br> and then we'll work out some way<br> what we'll do afterwards.<br> - Randy.<br> - I won't listen.<br> I'm going to cable Parris now and tell him.<br> He'll be glad, Drake.<br> Of course, Randy,<br> it is a ghastly and terrible tragedy,<br> particularly to have happened to Drake.<br> He lived by his freedom and independence.<br> He will feel, probably already feels,<br> that he's lost both.<br> It'll be your problem<br> to restore them to him.<br> Repairs to the body can sometimes<br> be made in a short space of time.<br> The injury to the mind,<br> to what is called the psyche,<br> this takes longer.<br> The psychic injuries strike at his pride,<br> his initiative,<br> and we shall have to save them<br> if we're to save Drake.<br> Never when I decided<br> to become a psychiatrist<br> did I imagine I'd be writing<br> my first prescription<br> for my dearest friend.<br> As soon as he's well enough,<br> he must find an interest<br> outside of himself.<br> Some job to do that will force him<br> to depend upon himself<br> and make his own decisions.<br> The helpless invalid complex<br> must be avoided at all cost.<br> In fact, he must be made to feel that<br> since he was making a living for himself<br> he will, of course, go on making a living.<br> I've written to the bank<br> instructing them to turn over to you<br> the small Tower estate that was left me.<br> Use it to make some sort<br> of a new beginning for you.<br> I don't care if it's real estate<br> or chicken farming,<br> so long as it is something<br> that will take his mind off himself<br> and make him realize<br> that he's still some use in this world.<br> I feel so helpless being way over here.<br> I rely on you.<br> You must obey my instructions faithfully.<br> Dear friend, Parris,<br> I don't know what I'd do<br> without your daily letters.<br> I think I'm just beginning to see<br> what you're trying to accomplish.<br> I had a terrible time about the money.<br> I tried to remember what you said,<br> to make him decide for himself.<br> But you know Drake, how proud he is.<br> If you could have seen him<br> jutting out his chin and saying...<br> I won't take charity.<br> - Very well, dear.<br> - Do you want me to take it?<br> You'll have to decide that<br> for yourself, Drake.<br> Women haven't got any sense<br> about money.<br> Of course, I'd hate to see you<br> hurt Parris' feelings.<br> What do you mean?<br> Oh, he's gone to all that trouble.<br> You'd do the same for him, mind you.<br> I guess you'd feel pretty bad, too<br> if he just took some of your money<br> without any intention of ever returning it.<br> But that's just the point.<br> How could I ever pay him back?<br> - You think I can learn needlework, honey?<br> - Don't joke like that.<br> Well, if there was anything at all<br> I could do...<br> You still got your brains, Drake.<br> No, don't turn your face to the wall.<br> Look at me.<br> You're my man and I love you.<br> And you're a better man than a lot I know.<br> Take Peyton Graves, for instance,<br> puffed up like a pouter pigeon<br> because he went ahead<br> with that real estate deal all by himself.<br> Say...<br> No, I guess, we couldn't.<br> Couldn't what?<br> That land down by the creek<br> you're so crazy about.<br> Oh, I don't know why we couldn't.<br> You've got brains.<br> Of course, you'd have to tell me<br> everything to do, I'm only a woman.<br> - Do you think we should try it?<br> - You're the boss.<br> Oh, let's, Drake.<br> We can do anything together.<br> We're just a young couple starting out.<br> Others have started on borrowed money.<br> Wouldn't old Parris be surprised<br> if he came home<br> and found us all set up in business?<br> His money doubled or maybe tripled.<br> Hey, go easy.<br> He wouldn't be ashamed of me then,<br> would he?<br> - Parris?<br> - He'd be proud of me, wouldn't he, Randy?<br> Sure, he'd be.<br> He'd be doggone proud of me,<br> wouldn't he?<br> Parris, my boy. Parris.<br> - Hello, sir.<br> - Well, well, home at last, eh?<br> I couldn't be gladder to see anyone.<br> You're looking very well, sir.<br> You haven't changed a bit.<br> Just grown up a little, that's all.<br> Well, come on, I got my buggy waiting.<br> Would you mind if I didn't come<br> right now, sir? I want to see Drake.<br> - You understand?<br> - Oh, sure, sure.<br> - Give me the bag.<br> - Fine.<br> Come up to the office<br> whenever you get through.<br> - Parris!<br> - Randy.<br> - Randy.<br> - Oh, Parris, I'm so glad to see you.<br> How is he? How is he, really?<br> Oh, I don't know, he's better.<br> I think he's better.<br> Oh, I've tried, Parris.<br> But now you're home.<br> Randy.<br> Oh, hurry, Drake will be crazy.<br> He'll be so glad to see you.<br> - Look. Look who's here.<br> - Drake.<br> Mary, blessed Mother of God.<br> Mary, blessed Mother of God.<br> Mary, blessed Mother of God.<br> Well, how does the old town look?<br> Oh, I don't know, all right.<br> Of course, after Vienna and Paris,<br> it's a little strange.<br> I'll bet.<br> Well, it's the same old provincial hole.<br> Population: 5,000 billy goats and me.<br> As long as there's you and people like you,<br> Kings Row will be all right.<br> I won't take up any more of your time, sir,<br> if you just tell me where my bag is,<br> I'll run over to the hotel.<br> Did you notice anything<br> as you came along the hall?<br> Something new or anything like that?<br> - Don't believe I did.<br> - Not a thing, eh?<br> Then I got a surprise for you.<br> Yes, sir, you wait and see.<br> Fixed it up to set you off on the right foot<br> and make you feel at home.<br> - You like it?<br> - It's very thoughtful of you, sir, I...<br> Well, I must say,<br> you don't seem very much pleased.<br> Don't tell me<br> that Europe's given you notions.<br> No, no, sir, it's not that. It's just that...<br> Oh, you've gone to all this trouble<br> and I don't think I'm going to settle here.<br> Not permanently, that is.<br> Not in Kings Row? Why not?<br> For one thing, I've been offered a position<br> in the school in Vienna,<br> an invaluable opportunity.<br> I secured a leave of absence<br> and came home here<br> because of Drake.<br> As soon as I'm sure he's all right,<br> I expect I'll go back.<br> Oh, this is a terrible shock, Parris,<br> I'd counted on...<br> Well, we need a new man here,<br> now that Dr. Gordon's dead.<br> Dr. Gordon's dead?<br> Yeah, hadn't you heard?<br> Passed on last month, like that.<br> Heart, I guess.<br> Newspapers must have passed me<br> on the way home.<br> Yes, sir, him is deader than a doornail.<br> Is either one of you gentlemen<br> Dr. Mitchell?<br> 'Cause you ain't, Colonel Skeffington,<br> then this letter must be for you.<br> - Amazing deduction, Daisy.<br> - Thank you, Daisy.<br> You's welcome. You's the doctor now.<br> Little Parris Mitchell,<br> what do you think of that?<br> - Mrs. Henry Gordon.<br> - Imagine that.<br> Haven't seen much of the Gordons lately.<br> Louise, not at all.<br> She wasn't even at her father's funeral.<br> - She...<br> - Well, I'll run along.<br> Come up to the house when you can.<br> We'll have a chin.<br> Thanks, I will.<br> Dr. Mitchell, I'm sure you were surprised<br> to hear from me.<br> Somehow, I felt that<br> I could trust your discretion<br> since you used to be a friend of Louise's.<br> I've been through a very trying experience<br> since my husband passed away.<br> Is Louise ill?<br> I'm afraid her mind has become affected.<br> After Drake McHugh<br> met with his accident,<br> Louise had a terrible scene with her father.<br> A little while after,<br> we heard a strange report<br> that he'd actually married...<br> A Miss Monaghan, who's taking<br> marvelous care of him, Mrs. Gordon.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes.<br> That seems remarkable, doesn't it?<br> But from that day on,<br> Louise refused to leave her room.<br> She wouldn't speak.<br> She did nothing but sit in her room.<br> Then Dr. Gordon passed away.<br> And now I have to tell you a terrible thing.<br> When...<br> When my dear husband<br> was lying here in this room,<br> Louise came downstairs.<br> I followed her after a few minutes,<br> and I found her...<br> Yes, Mrs. Gordon?<br> Just try to tell me quietly.<br> I found her standing over her dead father<br> and cursing him.<br> Dr. Mitchell, I'm a desperate mother.<br> I cannot bear that my daughter should<br> so defame the memory of a great man.<br> I know that you've been studying there<br> in Vienna.<br> There's no doctor here<br> who understands these things.<br> No one at all I can turn to.<br> Can you help me with her?<br> To keep her quiet.<br> - Where is she?<br> - I'll take you to her.<br> I've brought an old friend to see you.<br> Parris Mitchell, daughter.<br> Dr. Mitchell now,<br> and he's come to see you.<br> Hello, Louise.<br> - Parris?<br> - Yes.<br> Parris Mitchell.<br> I'm awfully glad to see you again.<br> It's been a long time.<br> Yes, it's been a long time.<br> Go away.<br> - You're Dr. Mitchell now.<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm not crazy, Parris.<br> - Of course not.<br> She thinks I am.<br> - It's a wonder I'm not, but I'm not.<br> - I know that, Louise.<br> - Have you seen Drake?<br> - Yes.<br> How is he?<br> - As well as he can be.<br> - She married him.<br> She was the kind he liked.<br> He never went with any other kind.<br> She takes good care of him, Louise.<br> He had to have care, you understand.<br> - My father cut his legs off, Parris.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> I was there.<br> - You were where?<br> - I was too late. If I hadn't been too late...<br> I'm not crazy, Parris.<br> I know, Louise.<br> You must find out about it.<br> There was a man who helped my father,<br> maybe he'd know.<br> I don't believe it was necessary.<br> My father did it on my account.<br> You see? You think I'm crazy, too.<br> Do you realize what you're saying?<br> A horrible accusation.<br> You've got to believe me, I kept a list.<br> He always talked about his operations,<br> other doctors don't do that.<br> He thought it was his duty to punish<br> wickedness wherever he found it.<br> He was a fanatic like my mother,<br> he used to talk to her.<br> - I think she knew, too.<br> - But your own father!<br> My father.<br> Nearly always he'd say their hearts<br> were too weak for chloroform.<br> But their hearts were not too weak<br> to be cut to pieces.<br> And with Drake, he had a double purpose.<br> He hated him because of me.<br> Parris, do you think I'm crazy?<br> No, Louise, I'm sure you're not.<br> I want you to begin quietly.<br> I want you to gather all the evidence...<br> But your father's dead,<br> it's all over and done with.<br> I want to tell. I want them all to know.<br> - But, Louise...<br> - I want to destroy his memory!<br> Have you thought<br> what terrible harm you would do?<br> Perhaps someone you love.<br> You used to love Drake.<br> To be crippled is terrible enough,<br> but to find out it was unnecessary...<br> - She married him!<br> - You must try to be calm.<br> Parris, will you help me?<br> Yes, Louise, I'll help you all I can.<br> - What will we do first?<br> - First?<br> We'll not say a word about this to anyone.<br> For a little while.<br> We'll keep it a secret between us,<br> you know, until we're sure.<br> I'll come and talk to you every day,<br> whenever you want.<br> If you want me to help you, you must<br> put yourself entirely in my hands.<br> Will you do that for me, Louise?<br> Maybe I will.<br> - For a little while.<br> - That's better.<br> Now, let's begin thinking about<br> other things.<br> There's a book I've been reading<br> you might like.<br> Do you think there could be<br> the slightest possible ground<br> for Louise's charges against her father?<br> - Yes.<br> - But a man, a doctor...<br> I don't say it's true. I say it's possible.<br> Sadistic surgeons are not unknown<br> in medical history.<br> They're scarce, thank heaven.<br> One in millions.<br> You're startled to think that such a thing<br> could happen right here in Kings Row.<br> You wouldn't be shocked<br> if you heard of it happening<br> in some remote town<br> in Europe somewhere.<br> I'm shocked because of Drake.<br> Son, men have often killed other men<br> who are after their daughters.<br> Murder.<br> Parris, I think you better get yourself free<br> of this Gordon case.<br> - I can't.<br> - Why not?<br> - Well, Louise isn't insane.<br> - Then she doesn't need your help.<br> If I don't help her, she'll become insane.<br> I've tried everything I know.<br> Talk, books, music.<br> I tell you, she'll go insane<br> unless I relieve her obsession<br> by letting her tell everything she knows.<br> You think it'll do any good to have a thing<br> like that noised around?<br> - Then do you want some real advice, son?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Get out of this town. Now.<br> Before you're in too deep.<br> - But I thought you said...<br> - Changed my mind.<br> That golden chance in Vienna, take it.<br> I can't leave here with this thing unsolved.<br> Go on like that from case to case,<br> you'll be here a lifetime.<br> Don't tell me you could be satisfied<br> to be here.<br> I never wanted to see Kings Row again.<br> But still it's...<br> I don't know,<br> it's the place where I grew up.<br> I used to love to walk around the country<br> and just look at it.<br> Every leaf and stick of it.<br> If I could do that now.<br> Can't you?<br> Afraid of meeting ghosts, or memories.<br> People I loved.<br> My grandmother. Dr. Tower.<br> Cassandra.<br> Places I remember. The stile and the pond,<br> the house I lived in.<br> - Been out there since you got back?<br> - Couldn't stand to see it.<br> I thought chasing away ghosts<br> from people's minds was right in your line.<br> - What?<br> - I gotta be running along now.<br> - Wait a minute. Colonel.<br> - So long, sonny.<br> Cassie!<br> Hello.<br> Don't go away.<br> I don't mean to intrude.<br> You see, I'm Parris Mitchell and I...<br> Are you Dr. Mitchell,<br> the one that plays the piano?<br> Well, nobody ever identified me<br> that way before.<br> - Professor Berdorff often speaks of you.<br> - Do you take piano from him?<br> - Yes, a little.<br> - But he tells me he has only dunderheads.<br> - I'm a dunderhead.<br> - I don't believe it.<br> How could you know?<br> He said you were a genius.<br> Well, I'm not. You have a trace of accent.<br> Are you European?<br> - I'm Viennese.<br> - I studied medicine in Vienna.<br> Yes, I know.<br> - You know everything, don't you?<br> - Some people get talked about.<br> I'm Elise Sandor. My father's head<br> of the experiment station here.<br> Of course, you've come to see your home.<br> We've been expecting you.<br> I always used to walk in this way, over<br> the stile, down the trees, past the pond.<br> The pond was a very, very special place.<br> It is to me, too. Would you like<br> to walk down and see it closer?<br> If you don't mind.<br> Why ever should I? It was yours first.<br> - Have you lived here a long time?<br> - Almost two years.<br> All that time?<br> And I didn't know, Miss Sandor.<br> Everyone calls me Elise.<br> I'm not used to "Miss" yet.<br> - How old are you? Do you mind?<br> - Nineteen.<br> - Why, you're just a baby.<br> - I don't think so.<br> Probably not.<br> Did you think you were just a baby<br> when you were 19?<br> No.<br> When you saw me, you called out a name.<br> Why did you that?<br> I think I was startled with the way<br> you looked sitting here.<br> Like someone named Cassie?<br> A little like someone, yes.<br> A little girl I used to play with.<br> - Your sweetheart?<br> - Yes.<br> We used to go swimming here.<br> We were just babies,<br> but I think we knew we ought not to.<br> You mean... Oh, you naughty children.<br> - It was a long time ago.<br> - What became of her?<br> She died.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - No, it's all right. I can think about it now.<br> Would you like to come up<br> and see the house?<br> I'm a little timid about it.<br> Can you understand?<br> Come on. I'll go with you.<br> Does it look the same?<br> Almost as it used to when I'd come in<br> from school.<br> A little smaller, but I expected that.<br> Father.<br> Here's a visitor come to see us.<br> It's Dr. Mitchell.<br> What do you think?<br> How do you do, sir.<br> I'm very happy to welcome you,<br> Dr. Mitchell.<br> Oh, but perhaps that's impertinent.<br> This used to be your room.<br> - We are the intruders.<br> - Not at all, sir.<br> It looks... Well, we had the piano over here<br> instead of where it is,<br> but otherwise, it's like coming home.<br> You'll stay to dinner, then?<br> He may, mayn't he, Father?<br> - Certainly.<br> - I'll bet you have a maid named Anna.<br> You're not a dunderhead.<br> - Surely?<br> - Surely.<br> Some things you don't do in the right way.<br> May I show you?<br> Would you? But this is a visit.<br> The next time you come.<br> No, no. Let's get at it now.<br> I'm not a teacher,<br> but I can show you some things, I think.<br> - Will you practice?<br> - Six hours a day, if you say.<br> Heavens, no. Here, now.<br> The beginning.<br> Your tone is thin.<br> You see?<br> I had no idea. It's 11:00.<br> - Father, for shame.<br> - Please forgive me.<br> What?<br> Going so early, Dr. Mitchell?<br> I'm going, but not so early, I'm afraid.<br> Good night, sir.<br> You must come often,<br> if my child isn't tiresome.<br> - Her? Oh...<br> - She is a little lonely sometimes.<br> Talks too much,<br> when she finds someone to listen.<br> You must feel that this is a little<br> your home again, if you will?<br> She means that, Doctor.<br> So do I, for that matter.<br> There's always room here.<br> You know the house.<br> I want you feel that you can come<br> sometimes to rest,<br> to stay over Sunday, whenever you will.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Which was you room?<br> The northwest corner room.<br> It's my room now. I love it.<br> I have my bed under the big window.<br> So did I.<br> I'm glad it's your room.<br> And I'm glad that you,<br> both of you live here.<br> Good night now.<br> It's been a wonderful day and evening.<br> - You'll come often?<br> - Yes.<br> You may be sure. Good night.<br> See all those marked in red?<br> They're all sold.<br> The whole number one tract.<br> - Twenty-four lots.<br> - That's great.<br> The clay pit workers took most of them.<br> Low prices, but they make wages<br> and pay off.<br> - Treasurer, show him the figures.<br> - I just finished.<br> That's how we stand, as of today.<br> Half of that's yours of course.<br> We're all gonna be nasty, old, rich people,<br> I can see that.<br> Not bad for a girl<br> and an old cripple piled up in bed.<br> It's marvelous, you kids. I'm tickled pink.<br> You know what you ought to do<br> when you open up the new tract?<br> You ought to save a couple of lots<br> for yourselves, move into a new house.<br> You'd like that, wouldn't you, Randy?<br> Like it? Why, that's what I've hoped for<br> more than anything. May we, Drake?<br> - Randy...<br> - Yes, honey, what is it?<br> Randy, listen.<br> I want you to promise me one thing.<br> I'll promise you anything.<br> Promise me I'll never have to go outside<br> of this house until I'm dead.<br> - Oh, Drake, how foolish.<br> - Promise me.<br> Of course I'll promise you<br> if you want me to, darling.<br> Forget it, Drake. It was just an idea.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - You're fixed up here fine. Forget it.<br> Well, I've got to go.<br> I've got a patient waiting.<br> Did you hear that, Drake?<br> He's got a patient.<br> Oh, I got a lot of patients.<br> Two colds and a pair of twins, last week.<br> I told you he'd be famous.<br> I'll come down to the door with you.<br> Will you be all right, Drake?<br> - Sure, what do you think?<br> - See you soon, plutocrat.<br> So long, Doc.<br> Do you suppose you'd hate to give me<br> a cup of coffee?<br> I wanna talk to you for a minute.<br> - Is Drake...<br> - He's all right.<br> We've got to expect those outbursts<br> once in a while.<br> Hello, Pa, Todd.<br> - Hello, Doc.<br> - Caught us at it.<br> - Parris wants to talk to me, Pa.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Well, we'll step in the parlor.<br> - Sorry to chase you out.<br> - Oh, that's all right.<br> - Oh, don't bother to make fresh.<br> - It's no trouble.<br> It isn't good,<br> that impulse of his to hide in a corner.<br> I've tried to get him to move,<br> even as far as downstairs.<br> I know it's bad for him up there.<br> He can see the trains and hear them.<br> Sometimes he has nightmares.<br> I've heard him wake up<br> in the middle of the night, screaming.<br> He won't be the old Drake until he can<br> go about as free as any of us.<br> Tod gave him a wheelchair once<br> for a present.<br> He would have killed him if he could,<br> and he loves Tod.<br> We'll think of a way.<br> I still believe we've half-won<br> a very ticklish fight.<br> Of course, your marrying him<br> did more than anything.<br> I never told you,<br> but I think it was fine of you.<br> - I didn't marry Drake out of pity, Parris.<br> - I knew that.<br> I never loved anyone else.<br> Even in school<br> I never had crushes on boys.<br> I liked them or I didn't. They said<br> naughty things to me and that was all.<br> Aside from that,<br> they treated me as one of themselves.<br> Then that day I saw Drake at the station,<br> well, he simply went to a place<br> in my heart<br> that had been waiting for him.<br> Drake. Oh, Parris!<br> Tall and laughing and going about<br> with his head up.<br> Then after his accident, I knew I had to<br> ask myself a question and answer it.<br> I'd loved Drake wholly.<br> What about that now?<br> What was left of it?<br> I was half afraid I might love him less.<br> That something I couldn't help,<br> something physical,<br> might turn me away from him.<br> There was my question staring at me.<br> Then, in one of your letters,<br> there was a sentence,<br> "You must remember now,<br> that Drake lives in a new world<br> "and that his relationship with it<br> and with everyone in it will be changed."<br> I knew that applied to Drake<br> and myself, too.<br> An episode of youth and fun had closed,<br> and with it had gone<br> all the demands, forever.<br> I knew then that I didn't love him any less,<br> only differently.<br> With an overwhelming,<br> new, calm feeling, Parris,<br> that so completely took the place of the<br> old excitement that it would last forever.<br> Randy, you are wonderfully wise.<br> The coffee's boiling.<br> You can't see him. Nobody can see him.<br> - I will! I will see him!<br> - What's that?<br> Louise! You shouldn't have come here.<br> You said you'd help me, but you won't.<br> You're only tricking me.<br> - I'm going to tell Drake. He'll help me.<br> - What is it?<br> She's the one he married.<br> Listen to me, Louise.<br> Get control of yourself.<br> - You mustn't see Drake. Drake is ill.<br> - You said you'd help me.<br> I said I would and I will, but I can't if you<br> don't do what I tell you. Go home now.<br> - Pa, you'll take her, won't you?<br> - Sure.<br> - Will you help me?<br> - Yes, Louise,<br> but you must let me do it my own way.<br> Go home with Mr. Monaghan now,<br> and I'll come to talk to you tonight.<br> - You'll do that for me, won't you?<br> - Yes, Parris.<br> Parris, that poor girl. What did she want?<br> I've been treating her.<br> Her mother sent for me.<br> Drake was in love with her once?<br> That was over even before<br> I went to Europe, Randy.<br> I suppose you might as well know.<br> Louise has had a sort of breakdown.<br> She has it in her head<br> that her father sometimes...<br> Well, her father sometimes performed<br> unnecessary operations.<br> - Drake.<br> - You mustn't think, Randy.<br> - You mustn't let yourself think...<br> - Parris, did Dr. Gordon...<br> - I don't know.<br> - You do and you won't tell me.<br> - I don't know.<br> - I could tell you something about that.<br> Something I ain't never told before.<br> Maybe I shouldn't now.<br> I think we'd better know<br> as much as possible now.<br> - I was there that night.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> Something that Sam Winters said.<br> He helped the doctor.<br> Something he said started me thinking.<br> He said...<br> Go on, Tod.<br> - Drake wasn't run over, Parris.<br> - What are you saying?<br> No, he wasn't.<br> When he was knocked over by them tiles,<br> he was caught between two cars.<br> As near as I know, he was sort of,<br> I guess you'd say pinched by a wheel<br> that didn't go clear over him.<br> Exactly what did Sam Winters say, Tod?<br> He said... I can remember<br> just the right words.<br> He said, "I looked good at them legs,<br> and the bones in neither one of them<br> "was broke up one bit."<br> Then it's true.<br> Stop it, Randy. Stop it.<br> Even so, we can't ever know.<br> Sam Winters, an unprofessional witness.<br> What he says doesn't mean a thing.<br> I know how you feel, Randy,<br> but we've still got Drake.<br> Drake's still alive.<br> That's the only important thing.<br> - When Drake finds out...<br> - He'll never find out.<br> Oh, but he will.<br> She'll come again or someone else will.<br> That kind of news always gets home.<br> Then what?<br> If it should ever enter Drake's mind<br> that this whole catastrophe<br> was anything but an accident...<br> What would happen?<br> I think the whole structure we built up<br> for him would topple down again.<br> This time we couldn't rebuild it.<br> He'd be gone.<br> Louise has got to be kept quiet, Parris.<br> I can silence her, Randy.<br> She could be put in an asylum.<br> Her mother wants that.<br> I can...<br> Whenever I had anything that<br> was too big for me,<br> I used to run home with it, here,<br> to my grandmother.<br> And what would she say, Parris?<br> She'd say, no one could tell me<br> what is right and what is wrong,<br> except myself.<br> She must have been a very wise old lady.<br> But there isn't a right without a wrong,<br> a terrible wrong.<br> Shall I commit Louise Gordon<br> to a life of unspeakable horror?<br> Or let her mother carry out her plan,<br> which is the same as my doing it?<br> You can't.<br> Then shall I set her free<br> and destroy Drake?<br> It isn't fair that you should have to decide<br> such a thing.<br> I know what I can do.<br> I can get on a train, then get on a boat.<br> Will you go back with me to Vienna, Elise?<br> - Parris.<br> - I mean it.<br> Yes, Parris. I'd go with you anywhere.<br> But you wouldn't be proud to go with me.<br> That's true, isn't it?<br> Parris, I've been so hoping.<br> Oh, for many things.<br> Ever since the first time I saw you,<br> and all the other times, too.<br> I've hoped that some day you would say<br> something to me as you've just said.<br> And other things I've hoped, too.<br> I've hoped that you would never want to<br> go back to Vienna, but stay here.<br> And find your work here, too.<br> I can't stay here. I've failed here.<br> Would you succeed then, in Vienna?<br> Perhaps you're right.<br> Perhaps I should never have tried<br> to be a doctor.<br> But that's childish, unworthy of you.<br> If I could see any way at all.<br> Parris,<br> are you sure that your treatment for Drake<br> is the right one?<br> If I can't cure him, my best friend...<br> That's just it. He is your best friend.<br> Perhaps you protect him too much.<br> It would only be natural.<br> Suppose he was just a patient.<br> Suppose they both were,<br> he and Louise Gordon.<br> Would you know what to do then?<br> Suppose they weren't people you loved<br> or even knew.<br> Don't say anything more.<br> Elise, wait here for me, right here,<br> a little while.<br> Of course I will, but why?<br> What you said just now,<br> I'm gonna try something.<br> If I don't come back,<br> you'll know I haven't succeeded.<br> Parris, don't go.<br> "A new feat in news transmission<br> is being tried<br> "in connection with the use<br> of wireless telegraphy..."<br> Why, kid.<br> - Stick your chin out, Drake.<br> - Why?<br> You're going to get the worst wallop<br> you ever had.<br> - Yeah? Who's gonna do it?<br> - I am.<br> Start swinging.<br> It's something about you<br> and Louise Gordon and her father.<br> - Parris.<br> - She was here today, Louise was.<br> She wanted to tell you<br> and I wouldn't let her.<br> - Parris, you can't. You said yourself...<br> - I've just come from the Gordons.<br> I've sent Louise out to tell anyone<br> she pleases,<br> but saying it to you I've saved for myself.<br> I won't let you, Parris.<br> Please, if you have any heart.<br> I'm not your friend now. You're not mine.<br> I'm your doctor. And you're my patient.<br> It's as if I'd taken you in<br> the operating room<br> and I had the scalpel in my hand,<br> which may make you<br> or destroy you.<br> What's this all about, kid?<br> My grandmother used to say,<br> "Some people grow up<br> and some people just grow older."<br> I guess it's time we found out about us,<br> you and me.<br> Whether I'm a doctor,<br> and whether you're a man.<br> You know the kind of man I mean, Drake.<br> There's a piece of poetry, Invictus.<br> I don't think I remember all the words.<br> "Out of the night that covers me<br> "Black as the Pit from pole to pole<br> "I thank whatever gods may be<br> For my unconquerable soul<br> "In the fell clutch of circumstance<br> I had not winced nor cried aloud<br> "Under the bludgeonings of chance<br> My head is bloody, but unbowed"<br> I don't know if you can take it, Drake.<br> Give it to me.<br> Dr. Gordon cut off your legs.<br> I don't know if it was necessary.<br> He was that kind, a butcher,<br> who thought he had a special ordination<br> to punish transgressors.<br> With you he had a double incentive<br> because of Louise,<br> heaven knows what else.<br> The caverns of the human mind<br> are full of strange shadows,<br> but none of that matters.<br> The point is, he wanted to destroy you.<br> Oh, not literally,<br> he wanted to destroy<br> the Drake McHugh you were.<br> He wanted to see you turn into<br> a lifelong cripple,<br> mentally, as well as physically.<br> That's all there is, Drake.<br> Now, if you turn your face to that wall...<br> That's a hot one, isn't it?<br> Were did Gordon think I lived, in my legs?<br> Did he think those things<br> were Drake McHugh?<br> Spout that poetry again, Parris.<br> I never was any good at poetry.<br> Drake, Drake.<br> What was it you wanted, honey,<br> to build a house?<br> We'll move into it in broad daylight.<br> And we'll invite the folks in, too.<br> For Pete's sake, let's give a party,<br> I feel swell!<br>
