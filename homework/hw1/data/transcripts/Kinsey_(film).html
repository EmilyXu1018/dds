                        Don't sit so far away.<br> - Anything that creates<br> a distance should be avoided.<br> - Okay.<br> And try not to frown.<br> - I'm sorry. Was I frowning?<br> - You have to relax.<br> How can I be expected to open up<br> if you're not relaxed?<br> - Right.<br> - Take a deep breath.<br> Start again.<br> As you can see, this piece of paper<br> has been divided into squares.<br> There are 287 of them.<br> Your sex history will fit<br> on this single page in a cryptic code.<br> Don't forget to mention that<br> there's no written key to the code.<br> The interview subject<br> will only be candid...<br> if he knows he's speaking<br> in the strictest confidence.<br> Right. Okay.<br> So, when were you born?<br> June 23, 1894.<br> Are you single or married?<br> Married.<br> - What is your race?<br> - Don't waste time asking the obvious, Martin.<br> - Fill it in yourself.<br> - What is your religion?<br> - Methodist.<br> - How often do you attend church?<br> Not at all now,<br> but I did regularly until I was 19.<br> How did you get along with your father<br> and mother when you were growing up?<br> That's a multiple question.<br> It allows me to ignore any part<br> I don't want to answer.<br> - How did you get along with your mother?<br> - Fine.<br> - We had a close relationship.<br> - And your father?<br> How did you get along with your father?<br> And what are we to do?<br> We turn away<br> from matters of the flesh...<br> and we turn to things...<br> of the spirit.<br> Lust...<br> has a thousand avenues...<br> the dance hall,<br> the ice cream parlor...<br> the tenement saloon...<br> the Turkish bath.<br> Like the Hydra...<br> it grows new heads everywhere.<br> Even the modern inventions<br> of science...<br> are used to cultivate immorality.<br> The gas engine...<br> has brought us<br> the automobile joyride...<br> and an even more<br> pernicious menace...<br> the roadside brothel.<br> Electricity...<br> has made possible<br> the degrading picture show.<br> Because of the telephone...<br> a young woman...<br> can hear the voice of her suitor...<br> on the pillow, right next to her.<br> And let's not forget<br> the most scandalous invention of all...<br> the talon-slide fastener...<br> otherwise known as the zipper...<br> which provides every man and boy<br> speedy access...<br> to moral oblivion.<br> Are you currently in good health?<br> I suppose so. Mm-hmm.<br> What makes you doubtful?<br> Every doctor I've ever seen.<br> Early disease left me<br> with a weakened heart.<br> Did you have any illnesses<br> that kept you out of school?<br> I had typhoid fever and rickets.<br> Also rheumatic fever.<br> Measles, chicken pox, pneumonia...<br> and several bouts of influenza.<br> Pomeroy, what are you doing?<br> You're worse than Martin.<br> Never make judgments about people.<br> I wasn't.<br> Your body posture told me that my list<br> of ailments made you uncomfortable.<br> Maybe it did. Sorry.<br> Maintaining<br> a nonjudgmental attitude...<br> is harder than you think.<br> The best way is to smile,<br> nod your head...<br> while looking me directly in the eye.<br> Where were we?<br> Your health as a boy.<br> It improved greatly when I<br> finally discovered the outdoors.<br> I never got over the excitement<br> of setting off into the wild...<br> escaping bed, illness, family.<br> Alone?<br> No. No. Never alone.<br> I was surrounded by friends.<br> Being in the outdoors taught me<br> to rely on my own judgment.<br> I started to learn about things<br> by grasping them...<br> tasting them, looking at them.<br> - Biology?<br> - Yes.<br> Biology.<br> The science oflife.<br> The fields and woods became<br> my new place of worship...<br> my cathedral.<br> The only sadness they brought<br> was when I had to leave them.<br> How old were you when you first<br> tried to pleasure yourself?<br> No. No. No euphemisms.<br> If you're talking<br> to a college graduate...<br> use "masturbation,"<br> "testicles," "penis"...<br> "vagina," "vulva,"<br> "urination," "defecation."<br> With the lower-level male,<br> it's "jacking off," "balls"...<br> "prick," "cunt," "piss," "shit."<br> I don't know, Gebhard. Maybe your Harvard<br> degree is too ivory tower for our purposes.<br> I was brought up out west.<br> I've rubbed shoulders<br> with ranchers, miners my whole life.<br> - And I thought you were<br> gonna shave that mustache.<br> - I like it.<br> It's a disguise, a cover-up.<br> Look at any movie. The villain's<br> always the one with the mustache.<br> My wife likes it.<br> You have a chance to make an important<br> contribution to knowledge and science.<br> Are you telling me you'd give that up<br> for a little facial hair?<br> Yes, I suppose I am.<br> Ah.<br> Well, keep it trimmed.<br> Let's get back to masturbation.<br> That's a mating call.<br> So, how'd you wind up<br> at the Stevens Institute, Al?<br> I thought you wanted<br> to be a biologist.<br> There are enough scientists<br> in the worid, son.<br> Engineers<br> are what society needs now.<br> I, um...<br> I had one of the old fits again.<br> I tried to stop it.<br> "Any habit which causes the sex fluid<br> to be discharged must be resisted.<br> "Doctors link it to<br> an assortment of illnesses...<br> "including insanity,<br> blindness, epilepsy...<br> even death."<br> What if it happens<br> while you're asleep?<br> "It is said that the loss of one ounce<br> of seminal fluid...<br> equals the loss of 40 ounces of blood."<br> I'm killing myself,<br> and I'm not even awake.<br> What are we supposed to do?<br> "Keep your bowels open...<br> "read the Sermon on the Mount...<br> "sit with your testicles submerged<br> in a bowl of cold water...<br> Think of your mother's pure love."<br> Why don't we pray.<br> - Come on. Keep firing questions.<br> - Come on. Keep firing questions.<br> Extreme rapidity makes it<br> very difficult for a subject to lie.<br> How young were you the first time<br> you had an orgasm while dreaming?<br> - How frequently did you have wet dreams?<br> - What did you dream about?<br> How young were you when you first<br> experienced hugging or kissing?<br> - Necking?<br> - Petting?<br> - Oral sex?<br> How young were you when you no longer<br> thought of your parents' home as your own?<br> Al, it's getting late. Let's make the rounds.<br> - Al.!<br> - Be right down!<br> Pack of Fatimas.<br> Okay, son. That'll be 15 cents.<br> You're a criminal, sir. I shall report you<br> at once to the local authorities.<br> DearJesus,<br> a goddamn Protestant.<br> - Did you not sell this vile weed to a minor?<br> - What business is that of yours?<br> It is the Lord's work to protect<br> the young from temptation.<br> - Men like you, sir, men of weak character...<br> - Get the hell out of my store.<br> - I've given you proper warning.<br> - Are offensive to right-thinking<br> American citizens...<br> Shut up! You know<br> what you are, Father? A prig.<br> - Al.<br> - A skinflint, a petty tyrant and a hypocrite to boot!<br> You think you matter?<br> You don't matter.<br> There's something wrong with him.<br> - Come on, Al.<br> - No.<br> Maybe your workload is too heavy.<br> You could drop mechanical drawing.<br> I've withdrawn from Stevens.<br> That's impossible.<br> I'm a senior member of the faculty.<br> Someone would've informed me.<br> Why? Everyone there hates you.<br> I'm going to Bowdoin to study biology.<br> And how do you intend to pay for that?<br> They've given me a partial scholarship.<br> And I've socked away<br> most of my scouting money.<br> You've become a shady person, Al...<br> a person who keeps secrets.<br> I had no choice.<br> What a disappointment<br> you turned out to be.<br> - How many years<br> of schooling did you complete?<br> - Twenty.<br> After taking my undergraduate degree<br> at Bowdoin...<br> I received my doctorate<br> from the Bussey Institute at Harvard.<br> I took a position<br> as assistant professor of zoology...<br> here at Indiana University.<br> At first I studied<br> the Rhaetulus didieri...<br> or stag beetle.<br> Then I discovered<br> a far more fascinating insect.<br> This is the American Cynipidae,<br> or gall wasp.<br> Here the wasp deposits an egg...<br> into its host plant.<br> In this case, an oak tree.<br> The adult wasp chews its way<br> through the tree...<br> and copulates.<br> At which point<br> it has the good sense to die.<br> The animal kingdom includes...<br> at least two million insect species.<br> So, what makes the gall wasp<br> so fascinating?<br> I've spent the last three years...<br> crisscrossing the continent,<br> collecting gall wasps.<br> And what have I learned from my tiny friends,<br> half the size of the household ant?<br> That you need a date.<br> Shh!<br> After studying thousands of these pesky<br> creatures under the microscope...<br> I've yet to find a single gall wasp<br> that's the same as another.<br> In fact, some are so different...<br> that the offspring of one generation...<br> bear no more resemblance to their parents<br> than a sheep bears to a goat.<br> There are those of us who might<br> take comfort in this fact.<br> Consider the implications.<br> If every single living thing is different<br> from every other living thing...<br> then diversity becomes<br> life's one irreducible fact.<br> Only variations are real.<br> And to see them...<br> you simply have to open your eyes.<br> Hello. Mind if I sit here?<br> Why?<br> Because you're<br> the only unattached male...<br> and I'm the only unattached female.<br> That's very sensible.<br> A man who cooks. How refreshing.<br> I picked it up when I went out west<br> to collect galls.<br> I was gone for 11 months, and I don't think I<br> saw more than a dozen people the whole time.<br> - Sounds lonely.<br> - Oh.<br> I enjoyed it.<br> I've been reading up on gall wasps.<br> - I think I know why they appeal to you.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> They have great big wings,<br> but they can't fly.<br> They are incapable of getting<br> from this hill to that hill...<br> unless it's close enough to walk...<br> which means it's possible...<br> to retrace each generation's steps,<br> hill by hill...<br> by hill by hill...<br> all the way back<br> to the very beginning.<br> The gall wasp Garden of Eden.<br> That's very interesting, Miss Millen.<br> You've managed to bridge the gap between Darwin<br> and the Book of Genesis in a single phrase.<br> - McMillen.<br> - Mmm?<br> - Clara McMillen.<br> - Oh!<br> I'm Prok.<br> - Sorry?<br> - It's a nickname my graduate<br> students have given me.<br> Pro... fessor K... insey. Prok.<br> At first I worried that it suggested<br> an inappropriate level of intimacy...<br> between teacher and student...<br> that could lead to<br> a loss of respect down the line.<br> I think it just means they like you.<br> Yes. Eventually I realized that.<br> Um, tomato bisque and sandwiches?<br> Please.<br> Such an impressive collection.<br> Thanks. They used to be<br> categorized by period.<br> But then I rearranged them<br> alphabetically by composer.<br> I find it's more efficient.<br> Did you ever think about playing professionally?<br> Because you're very good.<br> Oh, please. Thank you.<br> But, uh, "very good" isn't good enough.<br> I got you a present.<br> - Ah!<br> - Here.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, how marvelous!<br> - They're the right size.<br> - Oh!<br> Oh!<br> Oh!<br> At what age did you first<br> have premarital intercourse?<br> I didn't.<br> - So, at the time of marriage you were a virgin?<br> - Yes.<br> Was your spouse also a virgin?<br> Yes.<br> When you got married,<br> did you want to get married?<br> Very much.<br> I see marriage as a lifetime<br> partnership between equals.<br> You're a brilliant scholar<br> with a keenly perceptive mind...<br> and a profound respect for nature.<br> You're a capable hiker and camper<br> and a champion swimmer...<br> and you're the one girl in a million<br> who's as interested in insects as I am.<br> To be honest, Prok...<br> I'm just not sure.<br> Okay.<br> - I consider myself a free thinker.<br> - Yes!<br> Frankly, I find you a little "churchy."<br> "Churchy"?<br> And I've had another proposal.<br> I'm not saying no. I just need time.<br> Prok.<br> I think you're mean!<br> Mean, heartless and cold!<br> Astounding.<br> If you'll have me.<br> A gall wasp in amber.<br> - How old is it?<br> - About 80 million years or so.<br> Does Mrs. Kinsey<br> like her wedding present?<br> It's perfect.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - No, no, I...<br> l...<br> How beautiful.<br> May I?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm a little nervous.<br> It's okay. W-We don't have to...<br> No!<br> I'm ready.<br> - Forgive me, Mac.<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> It's just... It hurts too much.<br> It's... It's a long drive to my parents'!<br> We should get some sleep.<br> Robert's had a 92<br> in mechanical drawing...<br> a 95 in mathematics...<br> and a clean 100...<br> in shop practice.<br> Huh. That's splendid, Robert.<br> Congratulations.<br> I was worried that his teachers<br> were showing him favor...<br> due to my senior position...<br> but they tell me he is<br> the most gifted student in his class.<br> Well, living with the best teacher<br> at Stevens doesn't hurt, Father.<br> Oh, please.<br> At this rate, he'll finish his degree<br> in, uh, three years.<br> Al, tell us what you've<br> been working on.<br> - Well...<br> - Don't bother, Al.<br> She won't be able to follow you.<br> She's only had a fourth-grade education.<br> I'm studying gall wasps, Mom.<br> I've gathered over 100,000 specimens,<br> which is really only a drop in the bucket.<br> But my aim is...<br> Ten years ofhigher education, and he's<br> still collecting bugs.<br> Prok's also written a biology textbook.<br> Really?<br> It's read in colleges across the country.<br> It's actually a very good read.<br> So I assume you plan<br> to start a family soon.<br> No, no, I... Don't rush it.<br> Once you have children, you're<br> tied down forever... your life is over.<br> What?<br> I don't know what I expected, exactly...<br> but he's far worse<br> than I ever imagined.<br> He is pretty awful, isn't he?<br> - "I once read...<br> - Shh!<br> "That the decline of the Roman empire...<br> was the result<br> of too-frequent bathing."<br> Shh! Shh!<br> Shh.<br> "Some speculate...<br> "that rampant adultery...<br> is a possible cause of earthquakes."<br> I'm sorry you had to witness that.<br> I think I really fell in love<br> with you tonight.<br> Seeing you here.<br> Do you think<br> we can make this work, Mac?<br> I don't know.<br> I've... I've heard some people...<br> just don't fit together.<br> There's no one I'd rather be with.<br> Physically? I mean...<br> If only there were some way to know.<br> That's it, Mac.<br> Every problem has a solution...<br> even this one.<br> We just need to talk to someone,<br> an expert who's studied the matter.<br> What are you doing?<br> Why waste any more time?<br> Your hymen shows<br> an inordinate thickness.<br> Dr. Kinsey,<br> how large is your penis?<br> Excuse me?<br> When erect, how large is it?<br> How long from the scrotum?<br> Here?<br> Here?<br> Here?<br> I'm surprised you didn't pass out.<br> Is there anything we can do?<br> It's a common-enough problem.<br> Would you like to take care of it today?<br> Sure.<br> - Oh!<br> - God!<br> God. God.<br> What was the maximum number of<br> times you had intercourse with your spouse...<br> in any seven-day period?<br> I'd say... 20 or so.<br> At least three times a day the first week,<br> so 21, at a minimum.<br> Is there tongue kissing during foreplay?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - Hand on breast?<br> - Yes.<br> - Mouth?<br> - Hand on female genitalia?<br> - Hand on penis?<br> - Yes.<br> Mouth on female genitalia?<br> - Mouth on penis?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> I became pregnant with Anne in 1923.<br> I decided to give up my graduate work.<br> By the time Anne was born,<br> I had collected over 200,000 gall wasps.<br> Joan came along a year later.<br> Just afterJoan's fifth birthday,<br> I reached my goal of half a million wasps.<br> And Bruce is our youngest.<br> Bruce found the gall<br> that hatched the millionth wasp.<br> It was in the mountains<br> outside Mexico City.<br> They grow up so fast.<br> Wejust didn't know<br> who to talk to, Professor Kinsey.<br> What about your parents?<br> I'd rather die.<br> We heard you had good advice<br> for some of the biology students.<br> Sexual difficulty among newly married people<br> is more common than you think.<br> It's nothing to be ashamed of.<br> - How long have you been married?<br> - Two months now.<br> And, Emily, you've had absolutely<br> no response during that time?<br> It's like I'm dead down there.<br> We went to the doctor,<br> and he said there's nothing wrong.<br> Does Ben ever use his fingers<br> to excite you?<br> Um...<br> why bother...<br> now that we can do the real thing?<br> What's your most common<br> sexual position?<br> There's more than one?<br> Mac and I are still discovering some.<br> Emily, were you sexually experienced<br> before you got married?<br> No.<br> I still thought babies<br> came out of women's navels.<br> Did you ever masturbate?<br> It's all my fault.<br> I'm damaged in some way.<br> I'm frigid.<br> I don't think that's the problem at all.<br> Ben, do you ever perform<br> oral sex on Emily?<br> Uh, I... I don't know<br> what that means, sir.<br> Genital kissing.<br> My brother told me<br> that that causes problems...<br> later on...<br> with having babies.<br> Oh, I don't think that's true.<br> No, I heard that too.<br> I can assure you, there's no relation<br> between oral sex and pregnancy.<br> But how do you know?<br> How do I know the Earth is round?<br> It just is.<br> But... has anyone actually proven...<br> that there's no connection?<br> If you're asking whether<br> there's been a scientific study...<br> devoted to the subject<br> of oral copulation and fertility...<br> well...<br> frankly, I don't know.<br> Well...<br> then how can you be sure?<br> I felt like a blundering amateur.<br> I couldn't imagine where<br> those kids' crazy idea came from...<br> until I discovered this...<br> Ideal Marriage:<br> Its Physiology and Technique.<br> Oh, dear.<br> "Oral contact, while acceptable<br> as a means of stimulation...<br> is pathological if carried through<br> to orgasm and possibly injurious."<br> I must be in grave danger then.<br> Wait. "The hand should never be used<br> for the purpose of sexual excitation.<br> "There is but one finger of love with<br> which to approach the female genitals...<br> and that is the male organ."<br> It's all just hooey.<br> Morality disguised as fact.<br> - Just do your tie.<br> - Hmm? Oh.<br> Professor Kinsey's methods...<br> of collecting vast numbers<br> of gall wasps...<br> over a wide geographic range...<br> have made him a starred scientist.<br> They have also earned him<br> his immortal nickname...<br> "Get-A-Million" Kinsey.<br> "Bore-A-Million" Kinsey.<br> His new book,<br> The Origin of Higher Categories in...<br> "Sinnips"? "Cynips"?<br> Close enough.<br> Traces the origin of the gall wasp<br> back to its birthplace...<br> in the Upper Cretaceous.<br> So, now I give you...<br> Dr. Kinsey.<br> Thank you, President Wells, for that<br> incisive description of 20 years of work.<br> I thought you<br> might actually have read my book...<br> until I saw those crib notes<br> in your palm.<br> Crib notes!<br> Of course,<br> my other book on cynips...<br> hasn't been checked out<br> of the library in six years.<br> I'd be surprised<br> if a dozen people have read it.<br> But I guess I always knew<br> that gall wasps weren't going to...<br> make them beat a path to my door.<br> In any case, thank you, Herman.<br> This is... This is splendid.<br> A really fine event indeed.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Cheers, Prok.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Hear.! Hear.!<br> Cheers.<br> Some reform-minded undergraduates...<br> paid me a visit the other day,<br> Thurman.<br> They are campaigning for a sex course.<br> I already cover sex in the hygiene class.<br> Which the student paper called<br> the most useless course on campus.<br> Oh, Kinsey. I'm glad to see middle age<br> hasn't softened the edges.<br> - Mrs. Kinsey.<br> - Not only is your class irrelevant, it's irresponsible.<br> There's a V.D. Epidemic<br> sweeping this country, Thurman.<br> And that's my fault? I don't know<br> whether to be insulted or flattered.<br> Besides, there's a cure for syphilis...<br> and it's called abstinence.<br> Penicillin works just as well.<br> Herman, the trustees appointed you<br> to shake things up around here.<br> Why not address the need<br> for sex instruction that deals frankly...<br> with students' real questions,<br> real concerns?<br> Open sex instruction<br> promotes daydreaming.<br> It is better to address these matters<br> in a general medical course.<br> You mean an anti-sex course...<br> with irrelevant gabble<br> about dahlias and bees.<br> Gentlemen. Please.<br> I am going to take the students'proposal<br> under advisement.<br> Good.<br> But since I just got this job...<br> and wouldn't mind hanging on to it<br> for a couple of weeks...<br> I think I'm gonna stick with<br> the hygiene course for now.<br> Medical authorities state...<br> that, of the type of teenage giris applying<br> at public health stations for aid...<br> the percentage that is infected<br> with venereal disease...<br> is always very high.<br> In all of these cases...<br> where youthful energy<br> and inquisitiveness are unrestrained...<br> The sex urge is always present...<br> and promiscuity nearly always follows...<br> - With its inevitable harvest...<br> of abortions, illegitimate births and...<br> disease.<br> - What's your trouble, Jerry?<br> - Well, I... I've got a pretty bad sore down here.<br> Just stretch out on that table over there.<br> We'll have a look at you.<br> The story vividly portrays...<br> the misery caused to innocent victims...<br> - By the ignorance or selfishness...<br> of individuals infected with syphilis.<br> You had to learn the hard way...<br> that you can't tell by the looks of a woman<br> whether she has syphilis or not.<br> I guess that finishes me.<br> I'll have to quit school and go someplace<br> where people don't know who I am.<br> The cure forjuvenile delinquency is...<br> an education in the dangers<br> and consequences...<br> of breaking the time-tested rules...<br> laid down for the regulation<br> of human conduct.<br> The idea that men need sex...<br> is a lie.<br> If it were true...<br> the boy who exercises<br> his sex organs regularly...<br> would achieve the greatest<br> sexual experiences in later life.<br> Whereas, in fact, that boy<br> is likely to be sexually dead...<br> by the time he reaches adulthood.<br> Abstinence poses no difficulty...<br> for the college-age male.<br> Men don't reach their sexual peak<br> until the age of 40.<br> It is the lower-class male...<br> often Negro...<br> who finds it difficult<br> to control his urges.<br> However, perfect inhibition...<br> although an ideal to be striven for...<br> is not always achievable.<br> Stress and the worries of the day...<br> can lead to a weakening of resolve...<br> opening the door to temptation.<br> When tense at bedtime...<br> I find there are<br> little tricks to relaxing.<br> If I can't get to sleep...<br> I like to close my eyes...<br> and think of all theJohns I know.<br> Oh.<br> Well, not onlyJohns.<br> Sometimes Peters.<br> How about Dicks?<br> I'm sorry?<br> If you're here to enroll<br> in Dr. Kinsey's class...<br> If you're here to enroll<br> in Dr. Kinsey's class...<br> it's only open to faculty members<br> and their wives, graduate students...<br> seniors and married undergraduates.<br> Come back and try in the spring.<br> Are you a senior?<br> Um, we're engaged.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> Why offer a marriage course?<br> Because society has interfered...<br> with what should be<br> a normal biological development...<br> causing a scandalous delay<br> of sexual activity...<br> which leads to sexual difficulty<br> in early marriage.<br> In an uninhibited society, a 12-year-old<br> would know most of the biology...<br> which I will have to give you<br> in formal lectures.<br> So, let's start with the six stages<br> of the coital sequence.<br> Stimulation...<br> lubrication, erection...<br> increased sensitivity...<br> orgasm and nervous release.<br> Both sexes experience<br> all six stages equally.<br> Stimulation.<br> Who can tell me<br> which part of the human body...<br> can enlarge a hundred times?<br> Um... miss.<br> I'm sure I don't know.<br> And you've no right to ask me<br> such a question in a mixed class.<br> I was referring to the pupil<br> of your eye, young lady.<br> And I think I should tell you you're in<br> for a terrible disappointment.<br> It is often with the eye<br> that stimulation begins.<br> The actual adjustments which are made<br> in the male and female genitalia...<br> are shown on this slide.<br> The vagina must be spread open...<br> as the erect male organ penetrates.<br> You will see<br> that the clitoris is swollen...<br> thus providing<br> the erotic stimulation necessary...<br> for the completion of the act<br> on the part of the female.<br> You will also see<br> that this point on the penis...<br> which is one of the most sensitive points,<br> is similarly stimulated.<br> Ohh!<br> Where on earth did you get that cap?<br> Oh. Professor Kinsey. I'm sorry.<br> It's a whaler's hat.<br> Not very pretty,<br> but extremely practical in a storm.<br> - Do I know you?<br> - I'm in your marriage course. Clyde Martin.<br> How are you finding it, Mr. Martin?<br> Oh, it's the most enlightening class<br> I've ever taken.<br> Well, I'd better get going. I've got<br> a job interview at the zoology department.<br> Forget that. Come with me.<br> All right.<br> Don't worry. Dr. Kinsey will be staying late.<br> He'll get to all of you.<br> Can too much sex cause cancer?<br> Will wearing high heels<br> make me sterile?<br> I think my vagina's abnormally shaped.<br> Can you get syphilis from a whistle?<br> Is homosexuality a form of insanity?<br> I think about my cat.<br> A lot!<br> Does su-s-s-suppressing sex...<br> lead to stuttering?<br> Is my penis smaller than most?<br> Does too much masturbation<br> cause premature ejaculation?<br> Is it unusual for my boyfriend<br> to touch my anus?<br> All excellent questions.<br> They all have the same answer...<br> I don't know.<br> From a sexual standpoint,<br> it's hard to say what's common or rare...<br> because we know so little<br> about what people actually do.<br> This leaves most of us<br> feeling anxious or guilty.<br> Am I interested in the right things?<br> Do I do things the normal way?<br> One of the ways of finding out<br> what people do...<br> is to find out what they've done.<br> So please, take the time to fill out<br> these sex questionnaires.<br> Try to be as accurate and honest<br> as you possibly can.<br> This will only work...<br> Pass them along, please.<br> This will only work<br> if you tell the truth.<br> Dr. Kinsey, this is really... amazing.<br> These colors are incredible.<br> It's the most complete collection<br> east of the Mississippi.<br> We have over 250<br> separate varieties of irises.<br> Good work, Martin, but you're using<br> the wrong muscle group.<br> Come on. Here.<br> Bend the legs. Use the thighs.<br> - Okay.<br> - The arms should only be used to guide.<br> No, you do it. Guide.<br> Ah!<br> Lemonade.<br> Mac, these responses will floor you.<br> The gap between what we assume<br> people do and what they actually do...<br> is enormous.<br> You know what amazes me?<br> There's no relation between<br> how sexy a girl looks and her sex life.<br> The ugly ones<br> seem to get all the action.<br> I always thought "ugly"<br> was an ugly word.<br> Sorry.<br> Not only does every male in the class<br> have a history of masturbation.<br> Most of the women do too.<br> That doesn't surprise me.<br> What about premarital sex?<br> About a third of the married men<br> claim at least one experience.<br> - It's only one in 10 for the women.<br> - If they're telling the truth.<br> And there's extramarital sex too.<br> Not just heterosexual,<br> but homosexual.<br> I just wish we could get<br> more volunteers.<br> A hundred cases<br> is hardly representative.<br> Maybe it's because it's a questionnaire.<br> Feels too much like homework or a test.<br> I agree. Also, people don't know<br> if they can trust you.<br> - They have to be sure their secrets are safe.<br> - But that's ridiculous.<br> Everyone knows I keep those questionnaires<br> under lock and key.<br> Clyde has a point.<br> You're asking people to reveal<br> information that's very sensitive...<br> possibly even damaging.<br> What if you just talked to them?<br> Then all their secrets<br> would be in your head.<br> Martin, you should have<br> spoken up months ago.<br> I can't tell.<br> Was that a compliment?<br> Yes, I think it was.<br> People resist at first.<br> But I'm trying to choreograph<br> the questions...<br> so they'll be disarmed into answering.<br> - How many different things<br> have you put in there, Daddy?<br> - It's the Kinsey stew, sweetie.<br> "Clean out the refrigerator" night,<br> you mean.<br> Martin's been surprisingly helpful.<br> He's an ideal practice subject, since he's<br> had relations with both men and women.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - Swim practice.<br> - How'd it go?<br> - Pretty good.<br> - Coach said he might start me at the next meet.<br> - Bruce, that's wonderful.<br> I told you there won't be any more swimming<br> unless your science grades improve.<br> I can't help it, Dad. I hate biology.<br> That's because you have never<br> developed your intellect.<br> Physical activity is important, Son...<br> but your interest in sports<br> is excessive.<br> Yes. Maybe he should<br> take up engineering instead.<br> The one-on-one<br> is turning out to be so elastic.<br> Talking to people yields more information<br> than I ever imagined.<br> I think it will prove to be<br> a groundbreaking technique.<br> What if they make things up?<br> That's what I'd do.<br> I'm building in little trip wires<br> to catch lies and inconsistencies.<br> - Would you like to take my sex history, Daddy?<br> - Do you have a sex history?<br> No.<br> What about you, Anne?<br> You've been dating Jim for a while now.<br> We've done some petting.<br> I figured we wouldn't<br> try intercourse until college.<br> That's probably better.<br> If Anne can have intercourse,<br> I should be able to too.<br> Your sister's 18<br> and seriously involved with someone.<br> Does it hurt?<br> - What, dear?<br> - Breaking the hymen.<br> Oh...<br> just a little...<br> it's nothing too bad.<br> It helps if you spread the vulva<br> to facilitate penetration.<br> Can we please talk<br> about something else for once?<br> Other families don't do this.<br> It isn't normal.<br> When did you become such a prig?<br> My friends aren't even allowed to come over here.<br> Their parents think you're a menace!<br> You spend too much time in the water.<br> All that chlorine's done something to your brain!<br> - Have you learned nothing?<br> - Sometimes I don't know where he came from.<br> Nothing!<br> Bruce? Bruce.<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> He won't get off my back.<br> I heard about this community<br> from a former student of mine.<br> This is my third trip, and already<br> the results have been astounding.<br> By my calculation, there are over<br> and no one's ever even bothered<br> to talk to them before.<br> It's a gold mine of information, Martin,<br> and we've got it all to ourselves.<br> What'll it be, handsome?<br> Two scotches.<br> I find liquor is an essential tool<br> for social lubrication...<br> although it has involved more drinking<br> than I thought I would ever do in a lifetime.<br> Let's get started.<br> Hello, I'm Professor Kinsey<br> from Indiana University...<br> and I'm making a study<br> of sex behavior.<br> - Can we sit and talk?<br> - I assume you're joking.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I'd be grateful if you'd answer<br> some questions about your sexual history.<br> Mary here is a professor.<br> She says she wants to study<br> my sex behavior.<br> Well, tell her to stick around and watch.<br> - Andy's here. You have to see what he's wearing.<br> - I can't wait.<br> That Andy.<br> Hello. I'm Professor Kinsey from...<br> Excuse me. I'm Professor Kinsey.<br> Excuse me... Hello.<br> I'm Professor Kinsey<br> from Indiana University...<br> and I'm making a study<br> of sex behavior.<br> - Can I ask you a few questions?<br> - I've heard about you.<br> - You're the sex doctor, right?<br> - I guess I am.<br> If you'd be kind enough to talk to me,<br> it would be of great help to science.<br> Sure. What do you want to know?<br> Same boy. Tommy Potts.<br> We were messin'around<br> in a haystack...<br> you know, the way kids'll do.<br> Pop walked in...<br> found us, locked us in the barn.<br> Called my brothers in.<br> They, um...<br> They branded us.<br> Took turns doin' it.<br> Then they beat us raw.<br> Broke a couple ribs, collarbone.<br> Tommy, he, uh...<br> he didn't make out as well as I did.<br> - What age were you?<br> - Thirteen.<br> - And you've been on your own since then?<br> - I get by.<br> It's not that I mind being queer.<br> 'Cause I don't.<br> It's just, um...<br> I wish other folks<br> weren't so put out by it.<br> Homosexuality happens to be...<br> out of fashion in society now.<br> That doesn't mean<br> it won't change someday.<br> Right.<br> But why didn't I see it before?<br> Human beings are just bigger,<br> slightly more complicated gall wasps.<br> All I have to do is collect<br> more than anyone else...<br> and homosexuals<br> are the perfect place to start.<br> What?<br> I'm sorry. I just had an image of some<br> of our friends hearing you right now.<br> As if the marriage course<br> isn't bad enough.<br> Now, Prok, promise me you'll get at least<br> four hours sleep before heading back.<br> Of course.<br> And let Clyde share in the driving.<br> Prok?<br> Okay, Mac.<br> I'll sign off now.<br> I love you.<br> Love you too.<br> You know what<br> impressed me tonight?<br> Mmm?<br> The way that you talk to people.<br> You can get just about anybody to open up.<br> Oh, well, it's just a matter of, uh...<br> putting yourself on their level.<br> No, it's more than that.<br> You really seem to care.<br> - This rating scale of yours?<br> - Mm-hmm?<br> Uh, zero to six...<br> Zero being exclusively heterosexual...<br> and, uh, six being<br> exclusively homosexual.<br> A great many people line up<br> somewhere in the middle.<br> - What makes you think that's true?<br> - Common sense.<br> Remember, about a third<br> of our heterosexual histories...<br> have homosexual acts,<br> and vice versa.<br> Right.<br> I guess I'm about a three, huh?<br> Based on your sexual history...<br> I'd say that's, um, right.<br> How about you?<br> I suppose I've been a one or two...<br> most of my life...<br> even though it's taken a long time...<br> to recognize it.<br> And now?<br> Probably...<br> th-three.<br> Have you ever<br> done anything about it?<br> Would you like to?<br> I've taken on so many<br> other people's secrets.<br> I don't want any of my own...<br> and certainly not with you.<br> You still haven't said anything.<br> It's not like I'm...<br> surprised exactly.<br> I've observed...<br> certain things over the years.<br> Such as?<br> A look or a gesture.<br> The pet student who suddenly<br> becomes a member of the family...<br> and then just as suddenly disappears<br> when you tire ofhim.<br> I think you must know me<br> better than I know myself.<br> But I'm not sure...<br> I understand.<br> Haven't I always been open<br> to whatever you wanted?<br> It's not you, Mac.<br> You're the best partner any man could have.<br> I'm just not enough. Is that it?<br> Please, Mac.<br> This is inside of me.<br> To what extent, I don't know.<br> But I'd be a hypocrite<br> if I pretended it wasn't there.<br> - When I took your history...<br> - Don't! Don't!<br> - Didn't you admit to having<br> sexual feelings for other men?<br> - Don't use that against me!<br> I'm sorry. But what keeps you from<br> acting on your feelings? Convention.<br> No! It's our marriage!<br> It's our children!<br> Exactly. Social restraints.<br> Did you ever stop to think<br> that perhaps those restraints are there...<br> to keep people<br> from hurting each other?<br> I don't sleep with other men<br> because I love you...<br> and I don't want to hurt you.<br> But what if it didn't hurt me?<br> Then I'd be hurt.<br> You're just afraid that I won't love you<br> anymore, which is impossible, Mac.<br> The human animal is capable<br> of all kinds of sexual expression.<br> Not all sex has to be sanctioned<br> by love, enriched by emotion.<br> - To the Greeks...<br> - Stop!<br> Stop lecturing, Prok.<br> Stop using science<br> to justify what you've done.<br> Oh, Mac.<br> Mac.<br> Listen to me.<br> You're my girl.<br> You always will be.<br> The bond we have, the life we share...<br> sex is nothing compared to that.<br> I can't talk about this anymore.<br> Most people think<br> that what they do sexually...<br> is what everyone does...<br> or should do.<br> But I might remark that nearly all<br> the so-called sexual perversions...<br> fall within the range<br> ofbiologic normality.<br> For example, masturbation...<br> mouth-genital contacts<br> and homosexual acts...<br> are common<br> among most mammals...<br> including humans.<br> Society might condemn such practices<br> on moral grounds.<br> However, it's ludicrous<br> to call them unnatural.<br> But based on<br> the first Book of Genesis...<br> and according to public opinion...<br> there's only one<br> correct sexual equation...<br> man plus woman equals baby.<br> Everything else is vice.<br> But the orgasm record of the males<br> in this classroom alone...<br> proves the ineffectiveness<br> of social restrictions...<br> and the imperativeness<br> of the biologic demand.<br> Why are some cows highly sexed...<br> while others just stand there?<br> Why do some men<br> need 30 orgasms a week...<br> and others almost none?<br> Because everyone is different.<br> The problem is,<br> most people want to be the same.<br> They find it easier to simply ignore...<br> this fundamental aspect<br> of the human condition.<br> They're so eager<br> to be part of the group...<br> that they'll betray their own nature<br> to get there.<br> If something pleasurable<br> and strongly desired is prohibited...<br> it becomes an obsession.<br> Think about this.<br> You have better things to do...<br> than help a middle-aged woman home<br> with her groceries.<br> Prok got worried<br> when he couldn't reach you.<br> Said he had to take histories<br> later this evening...<br> so he'd like an early dinner.<br> - Hmph.<br> - Preferably 5:00.<br> Hardly gives me time to boil an egg.<br> - Can I help?<br> - No. I'll manage.<br> I just... I'm sorry<br> he made you play messenger.<br> No. I volunteered.<br> Mmm.<br> Hear that?<br> - What?<br> - The sound of an empty nest.<br> Must be a big adjustment.<br> Have you heard from Bruce yet?<br> No. He's loving college.<br> Maybe it's just<br> being away from here.<br> - Oh.<br> - Would you like a piece of pie?<br> - Rhubarb?<br> - Have a seat.<br> You know, Clyde,<br> I didn't like you very much at first.<br> I don't blame you.<br> - Most women would have had me murdered.<br> - Oh, I considered it.<br> I hate to think of myself<br> as conventional.<br> But if this had to happen...<br> I'm glad it was you.<br> And I... have to admit<br> there have been some benefits.<br> It certainly sparked things up sexually.<br> I suppose we'd both grown bored<br> without even realizing it.<br> I think you've handled it<br> remarkably well.<br> I learned something a long time ago.<br> Once Prok has his mind set,<br> it's no use trying to stop him.<br> Yes.<br> He is...<br> relentless.<br> Clyde?<br> You know, this thing<br> between Prok and me...<br> it was fine for a while, but...<br> I guess I just really miss<br> sleeping with women.<br> That's perfectly understandable.<br> It's clear from your history, you have<br> a greater sexual interest in women than men.<br> Good.<br> Then you won't mind<br> if I ask Mac to have sex with me?<br> I mean, only if it appeals to you,<br> of course.<br> - Would it be separately or together?<br> - Oh, definitely just you and I.<br> Oh, I think I might like that.<br> What do you think, Prok?<br> Mac. The Rockefeller Foundation<br> is coming today.<br> You-You know,<br> I enjoy this... tremendously.<br> We still have to catalog<br> those prints, Martin.<br> - Please.<br> - Coming, Prok.<br> - Please.<br> - Coming, Prok.<br> - It's just... It's a very full day.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Coming!<br> One key to understanding<br> a foreign culture is its pornography.<br> Every culture produces<br> its own peculiar sexual imagery...<br> as distinct as its cuisine.<br> As you can see, Brazil's imagery<br> tends towards zoophilia...<br> while Italy favors nuns and priests.<br> In England, one often sees depictions<br> of the stern headmistress...<br> wankers and spankers.<br> While in the Far East,<br> it's soft "flage"and light bondage.<br> You've amassed<br> an impressive collection.<br> Thank you. Only what I've been able<br> to afford from my own savings.<br> But if the Rockefeller Foundation<br> agrees to our grant...<br> some of that money will help us<br> build a worid-class library.<br> Um, Herman? That's 200 years old.<br> - Oh.<br> - Have you any idea when you might decide?<br> Prok, please, Dr. Gregg just got here.<br> Sometimes I'm amazed anything has survived.<br> The Library of Congress has a policy...<br> of destroying whatever<br> it considers too erotic.<br> The loss to science has been, uh, incalculable.<br> There's plenty of time to take<br> your sex histories before dinner.<br> Who'd like to go first?<br> I...<br> I- I... I don't, uh...<br> Early in my bug-hunting days,<br> someone asked me what I was looking for.<br> I said I wouldn't know<br> until I saw it statistically.<br> A scientist can only generalize<br> with reliable certainty...<br> if he has enough<br> statistical information.<br> Is this your first time<br> in Bloomington, Dr. Gregg?<br> Yes. It's lovely.<br> Hillier than I expected.<br> That's why I've broken<br> the American population down...<br> into 200 major social subgroups.<br> We'll get anywhere from 400<br> to a thousand histories from each group...<br> for a total of 100,000,<br> give or take a few.<br> It could take 20 years, but, at the end,<br> we'll finally be able to answer...<br> most of the basic questions<br> about human sexuality.<br> Herman, is the pot roast dry?<br> No. It's delicious.<br> The first publication<br> will be a male volume...<br> followed a year later<br> by the female study...<br> then another nine books dealing<br> with sex offenders, homosexuality...<br> pregnancy and abortion and art...<br> studied from a sexual standpoint,<br> of course.<br> With the children gone,<br> I don't get to cook big meals anymore.<br> Mac. Let's get to the point.<br> This project is one of<br> the greatest ever undertaken...<br> in connection<br> with the human animal.<br> But without support from the Rockefeller<br> Foundation, it will never get off the ground.<br> There are those who argue that...<br> sex is largely a matter of feelings<br> and psychological attitudes...<br> things beyond your training<br> as a zoologist.<br> That's like saying a biochemist can't<br> analyze cooking because he's not a chef.<br> - It's inane.<br> - Prok, come on.<br> That is, it's really a very stupid way<br> of looking at things.<br> One of the aims of science<br> is to simplify.<br> The only way to study sex<br> with any scientific accuracy...<br> is to strip away everything<br> but its physiological functions.<br> And this team you're proposing?<br> I'll need two pair of hands at least...<br> both with advanced degrees in science.<br> And Clyde Martin, of course.<br> Since you're working<br> in such a delicate area...<br> they need to be as clean<br> as Fuller Brush men.<br> Um...<br> Door-to-door salesmen, Prok.<br> I think what Dr. Gregg is saying<br> is that anyone involved in the project...<br> needs to have motives that are entirely pure<br> and scientific and above reproach morally.<br> - I couldn't agree more.<br> - Ah.<br> - Now, there's one more thing.<br> - Mm-hmm?<br> I hope you're not planning to dwell<br> on sexual oddities and perversions.<br> Science is always interested<br> in the rare.<br> Yes, but it's advisable<br> to stick to what's normal.<br> You don't want to shake people up.<br> Of course not.<br> I'm just a taxonomist... a measurer.<br> I'm happy to leave<br> the social policies to others.<br> Ah. Ah.<br> Well, that all sounds good.<br> Very good.<br> So, if you're ready...<br> I'd like to begin with<br> a few background questions.<br> No. All wrong. Start by putting<br> the subject at ease.<br> No. All wrong. Start by putting<br> the subject at ease.<br> - Would you care for a drink, Mac?<br> - Why, a glass of water would be very nice.<br> Do anything fun this weekend?<br> My daughters were in town,<br> so I never stopped.<br> We had a marvelous meal<br> Saturday night.<br> - Really? What did you cook?<br> - I started with a little...<br> See how much more relaxed<br> she's become?<br> If you ease in<br> with innocuous questions...<br> people forget<br> they're giving sex histories.<br> How did you first<br> find out about masturbation?<br> I invented it, son.<br> Sometimes I tie a rope<br> around my balls when I jerk off.<br> - And what other masochistic acts do you enjoy?<br> - Does that mean "queer"?<br> How often do you have intercourse?<br> - Two or three times.<br> - A month?<br> - No, a day.<br> - Mmm.<br> How often do you reach orgasm?<br> - Once.<br> - A day?<br> No. Only once.<br> About 20 years ago.<br> I was sitting on a piano stool<br> listening to music.<br> Mm. Oh, that's good.<br> How old were you when you first engaged<br> in sexual activity with a partner?<br> - Fourteen.<br> - How?<br> With horse.<br> How often were you having intercourse<br> with animals at age 14?<br> Is true. I fucked a pony.<br> You are genius.<br> How did you know?<br> You just said<br> you had sex with a horse.<br> No. Whores.<br> Not horse. Whores.<br> Do you find my answers typical?<br> - Am I normal?<br> - Am I normal?<br> Am I normal?<br> Yes. I found a book<br> in the dining room buffet...<br> under all the tablecloths,<br> and I used to put it under my shirt...<br> and go into the bathroom<br> and sit and read it.<br> But I was very frightened.<br> - She told her mother<br> that she didn't like it.<br> - How will I get it back?<br> Or maybe it was just<br> her mother who didn't like it.<br> Before you know it,<br> the police bangin' on the front door.<br> Hell, I didn't even know it was illegal.<br> - Now I'm in here for five years.<br> - One of them old gals<br> caught me out in the field.<br> I guess I was about nine, 10.<br> And she say she was gonna<br> show me a new game called "puddin'."<br> And, well, I guess I kinda liked it.<br> Horses in the stable, and by watching them...<br> The father said, "I put my roll of bills<br> in your mother's pocketbook...<br> - and I got you for change."<br> - But it felt good.<br> - I saw myself as nasty and terrible...<br> - I believe in God...<br> I went to my mother...<br> "Mama, is this true?<br> Do men put their thing in women?"<br> I only did it that one time.<br> If you weren't a virgin, you were<br> a fallen woman. Nobody would want you.<br> Tested us for, uh,<br> masculine and feminine traits.<br> - They were both naked.<br> - It was part of me.<br> You may kiss the bride.<br> Did you hear Professor Kinsey<br> found a place for us to live?<br> Oh, let me guess.<br> It's just a few blocks from here.<br> - How did you know?<br> - He likes to keep the troops in one place.<br> At least you passed the test.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Well, he took your sex history, didn't he?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Well, he wouldn't have let Clyde<br> marry you unless you fit in.<br> Uh, didn't Clyde mention<br> the calendars?<br> Prok likes for us to keep a record<br> of our sexual activity.<br> - Tell them about that dream<br> you had the other night.<br> - Mmm!<br> I was in the middle of<br> the most intense erotic encounter...<br> - He wouldn't say who with.<br> - When all of a sudden the doors flew open...<br> and there was Prok standing there<br> with that stern look of his.<br> "Gebhard, hurry up! You're wasting countless<br> thousands of hours of project time."<br> Well, needless to say,<br> the mood was broken.<br> So he woke up, and I had to take over.<br> It was the quickest orgasm he ever had.<br> We're trying to get pregnant again...<br> so, uh, there was no raincoat<br> to dull the sensation.<br> Oh.<br> Do the Kinseys know<br> that you talk like this?<br> Uh...<br> - Could I get a picture?<br> - Um...<br> why don't you call me when you<br> get back from the honeymoon?<br> We'll have a nice long lunch.<br> - Look at the birdie.<br> - Oh.<br> No, I've got the report.<br> Thank you.<br> Uh, often among boys<br> who live in cities and towns, comma...<br> Less often among farm boys, period.<br> Perhaps you wanna say<br> "boys from small towns"...<br> - instead of"farm boys."<br> - Say-Say farm boys. Farm boys.<br> What's the difference?<br> He's gonna rewrite it anyway.<br> Henry.<br> Everything looks in order here.<br> You can have either Thanksgiving<br> or Christmas off.<br> Your choice entirely.<br> Do you need anything before I go?<br> We'll never get this book done<br> if people start leaving early.<br> I'll stay if you let me<br> help you with these.<br> You don't have the time to answer<br> each one personally.<br> If people take the trouble to write,<br> it's the least I can do.<br> Mrs. Kinsey said to remind you<br> to come home to eat.<br> And your father phoned again.<br> Do you want me to talk to him?<br> No. I'll do it.<br> For thine is the kingdom...<br> and the power<br> and the glory forever.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> - Hello, Mildred.<br> - Mr. Morrissey.<br> Come say hello to Father.<br> I'm very sad for you, Alfred.<br> Well, it's not as though<br> I'll be alone.<br> My daughter's too fat<br> to get a husband.<br> And my son's lost his business.<br> He moved back home.<br> The only one I got rid of<br> is the big scientist.<br> Now he's working on some...<br> secret project.<br> He was always the secretive type.<br> Would you really like to know<br> what I'm working on, Father?<br> Oh, listen to this.<br> He's gonna tell me his big secret.<br> It's really not a secret at all.<br> I'm trying to find out<br> what people do sexually.<br> You heard right, Father.<br> It's a sex study.<br> Well, what do you expect me<br> to do, applaud?<br> No.<br> But I would like you<br> to contribute to the project.<br> Oh.<br> And you first moved<br> to Hoboken at what age?<br> Sixteen.<br> Could have done this interview<br> without me, Al.<br> I haven't told you a damn thing<br> you didn't already know.<br> Let's move on then.<br> - How young were you<br> when you first masturbated?<br> - What?<br> - Touched yourself.<br> - I never did that.<br> The male without a history<br> of masturbation is almost nonexistent.<br> Well, he exists, Al,<br> and you're looking at him.<br> This isn't gonna work.<br> I don't know why I bothered.<br> Stay where you are.<br> I'll try again.<br> How often did your masturbation<br> occur in adolescence?<br> There was a problem, a...<br> A ch...<br> "chronic condition,"<br> the doctors called it.<br> How long did this continue?<br> I was outfitted...<br> with a tight strap<br> that I had to wear at all times.<br> It... It kept me from coming<br> into contact with my genitals.<br> It was a...<br> a highly embarrassing remedy,<br> but it-it proved effective.<br> The condition was cured.<br> How old were you?<br> I- I was 10.<br> I'm so sorry, Dad.<br> I'm feeling a little tired now.<br> Sounds to me like you're<br> wasting your time, Al.<br> Nobody wants to know<br> about these things.<br> How are you?<br> When can we see Dr. Kinsey?<br> - Hey. Hey, that's him! That's Kinsey!<br> - There he is.!<br> My name is Dr. Thurman Rice...<br> and I'd be happy to talk to you<br> about Professor Kinsey's...<br> - Over here.!<br> - Repugnant book.<br> You are free to read and take notes...<br> but under no circumstances<br> is the manuscript to leave the room.<br> I won't deny the going<br> might get a little rough.<br> Dr. Kinsey's findings are surprising,<br> sometimes even shocking.<br> For example, marital sex, which is really<br> the only kind everyone agrees on...<br> is only one of nine means by which<br> the American male achieves orgasm.<br> Premarital sex, extramarital sex...<br> masturbation and homosexuality...<br> are much more prevalent than anyone<br> has ever imagined before.<br> I can assure you that Dr. Kinsey...<br> has done everything in his power...<br> to present this book tastefully.<br> So, I thought this<br> might be a good time...<br> to ask for a formal show of support.<br> Those in favor.<br> I just hope it's not going<br> to bring too much publicity.<br> With any luck, Mrs. Spaulding...<br> the general public won't even notice.<br> #According to the Kinsey Report #<br> #Every average man you know #<br> #Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court #<br> # When the temperature is low #<br> #But when the thermometer goes way up #<br> #And the weather is sizzlin'hot #<br> #Mr. Gob for his squab #<br> - That'll be "sex-fifty" please.<br> - #A marine for his queen #<br> #A G.I. For his cutie-pie is not #<br> # 'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot ##<br> In an open society...<br> it is done through observation.<br> But in a Puritan culture,<br> sex remains a dirty secret...<br> often made dreadful through<br> plain ignorance of what to do.<br> Mark my words,<br> as soon as the publicity dies down...<br> the American public will greet this book...<br> with the thundering silence it deserves.<br> What brings you to New York,<br> Dr. Kinsey?<br> We'll be taking the sex histories<br> or artists, writers and actors...<br> including the entire cast<br> of A Streetcar Named Desire.<br> We'll also be interviewing women<br> for our next book, which is a female study...<br> as well as meeting with our benefactors<br> at the Rockefeller Foundation.<br> Are you surprised<br> at the success of your book?<br> No. It shows that the worid<br> has wanted this done.<br> Any plans on a Hollywood picture<br> based on the book?<br> I can't think of anything more pointless.<br> What about you, Mrs. Kinsey?<br> Has your life changed much?<br> My husband's busier than ever.<br> I hardly see him since he's taken up sex.<br> What about<br> this female study, Mrs. Kinsey?<br> Gentlemen.<br> Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.<br> If you want to write<br> about something useful...<br> I suggest you look into<br> the current sex offender codes.<br> The majority of sex offenders<br> in our prisons...<br> have nothing in their histories different<br> from the rest of the population.<br> Their only crime is being too poor<br> to hire a lawyer.<br> This is unfair.<br> Everybody's sin is nobody's sin.<br> And everybody's crime<br> is no crime at all.<br> "Everybody's sin is nobody's sin."<br> That wasn't my point at all.<br> The newspapers lift things out of context<br> to make sensational reading.<br> Still, it's hardly your place<br> to offer moral prescriptions.<br> You're sounding more like<br> a- a preacher than a scientist.<br> My father always hoped<br> I'd become a preacher.<br> And why do you insist on flaunting<br> your association with the foundation?<br> Haven't I just given you the best-selling<br> scientific volume ever published?<br> - Not only here but across the globe.<br> - Yes.<br> And it's casting a bright light<br> on every aspect of the project...<br> especially some<br> of your latest methodology.<br> Who have you been talking to?<br> - Well, I assume that most of it is gossip.<br> - Alan.<br> It's been said that, uh...<br> you've taken to observing women.<br> - Go on.<br> - In a heightened state of arousal.<br> It's true?<br> Yes. And do you know why?<br> We went to the leading gynecologists<br> and asked for physical measurements...<br> and they barely knew<br> what we were talking about.<br> When it comes to female sex organs...<br> we're all tragically ignorant.<br> Who are these women?<br> - Volunteers. Friends of the project.<br> - Prostitutes.<br> No. Prostitutes are useless.<br> They fake their orgasms.<br> - Jesus...<br> - Alan.<br> The sex histories we have<br> are invaluable.<br> Everyone knows true science<br> lies in direct observation.<br> Nothing can replace<br> what the eye can see directly.<br> - Or the camera.<br> - Camera?<br> Don't tell me.<br> Y- You're making movies?<br> Just some photographic studies<br> of mammalian behavior.<br> Oh. Nature films.<br> Animals.<br> Yes, if you like.<br> Gentlemen, you're about to meet<br> a truly rare creature.<br> Even the most casual contact<br> arouses a sexual response in her.<br> In intercourse,<br> her first orgasm occurs...<br> within two to five seconds after entry.<br> - All set there, Barbara?<br> - I think so.<br> Come on in.<br> - Hello.<br> - How do you do?<br> Did I mention that Barbara didn't have<br> her first orgasm until she was 40?<br> Notice how she gently strokes<br> the inner lips and the clitoris.<br> Eighty-four percent of our sample<br> stimulate themselves in this way.<br> What about the vagina?<br> For all but a small minority of women,<br> the vaginal tube is a dead cavity...<br> practically devoid of nerve endings.<br> As you can see,<br> the introduction of the penis...<br> does nothing to relocate<br> the source of stimulation...<br> even with as skillful a partner<br> as Pomeroy.<br> - That is you, isn't it?<br> - Last time I looked.<br> For years, women have been told that<br> a clitoral orgasm is immature, neurotic.<br> So they've struggled with great anxiety...<br> to relocate the orgasm in the vagina...<br> when, for many,<br> it's a biologic impossibility.<br> According to the psychoanalysts,<br> this woman is frigid.<br> Good news, everyone.<br> The Rockefeller Foundation<br> announced its annual grants today.<br> We've received $40,000<br> for the next year...<br> the highest grant they've ever bestowed<br> on a scientific project.<br> Well.<br> And they've agreed to underwrite<br> a new corporation...<br> making us future employees<br> of the Institute for Sex Research.<br> - To Dr. Kinsey.<br> - Hear! Hear!<br> - And Mrs. Kinsey.<br> - Hear! Hear!<br> And to our husbands...<br> the Fuller Brush men of sex.<br> Come here, my little prick nibbler.<br> Oh.<br> Come on. Everyone, enjoy yourselves.<br> Ah. You don't look happy.<br> No, I am. Really.<br> It's just that Clyde is going<br> to be away for so long this time.<br> Ah. Well, don't worry.<br> I'll keep an eye on him.<br> A lot of good that will do.<br> What are you trying to say,<br> Mrs. Martin?<br> God, you're pretty.<br> - Drink up your grapejuice, gentlemen.<br> We have gathered only 9,300 histories...<br> and we have<br> the female volume to complete.<br> Starting tomorrow,<br> we need to triple our efforts.<br> Well, it's still tonight, and since<br> my third leg keeps hittin'me in the face...<br> I think it's time for a tumble.<br> In the bonobo chimpanzee...<br> our nearest primate relation...<br> sex is the glue<br> of social cohesion and peace.<br> Cleared of notions like romantic love...<br> or religion or morality...<br> their society's behavior<br> hangs together...<br> as a coherent unit<br> ofbiology and conditioning.<br> Based on the experiences of females<br> who have contributed to our histories...<br> we have observed a wide range<br> of motivations for extramarital coitus.<br> At times, it is a conscious or unconscious<br> attempt to acquire social status.<br> In other instances,<br> it gives them a variety of experiences...<br> with new sexual partners who are sometimes<br> superior to their marriage partner.<br> There are occasions<br> when it is done in retaliation...<br> for the partner's<br> extramarital activity...<br> or for some sort<br> of nonsexual mistreatment.<br> Some females discover new sources<br> of emotional satisfaction...<br> while others find it impossible to share<br> such an intimate relationship...<br> with more than one partner.<br> We have also encountered<br> a considerable group of cases...<br> in which husbands encourage their wives<br> to engage in extramarital activities...<br> in an honest attempt<br> to give them the opportunity...<br> for additional sexual satisfaction.<br> I've corresponded with<br> this man for over 10 years, Pomeroy...<br> but I never thought he'd agree to meet.<br> He's amassed a lifetime of data.<br> Working for the Forestry Department<br> has involved a lot of traveling...<br> so I've met a wide array of people.<br> - By the way, my name is...<br> - Please. There's no need.<br> Kenneth Braun.<br> Don't worry, Dr. Kinsey.<br> I trust you.<br> We're actually a lot alike, you know.<br> - How so?<br> - I record everything too...<br> the depth of every vagina<br> I've encountered...<br> the length and circumference<br> of every penis...<br> the time to reach orgasm...<br> the distance of ejaculation.<br> I've written it all down.<br> This is the record of my...<br> my life's real work...<br> which is sex, by the way.<br> Um, I find that recording is a...<br> is a way to experience things<br> a second time, don't you?<br> I also have certain... rare abilities.<br> From a completely flaccid start...<br> I can become erect and ejaculate<br> in 10 seconds flat.<br> I'd say that's pretty much<br> physiologically impossible.<br> Why, the rush ofblood alone would...<br> Oh! Oh!<br> Shall we get started?<br> My grandmother introduced me<br> to sexual intercourse when I was 10.<br> My first homosexual act<br> was, uh, with my father.<br> Uh, I was 11...<br> Of the 33 members<br> of my extended family...<br> I've had sex with 17 of them.<br> That's five generations now.<br> My penis is 8.24 inches long...<br> with a diameter of 2.8 inches<br> when fully erect.<br> In my youth, I averaged eight cubic<br> centimeters of semen per ejaculation.<br> By the time I was 50,<br> I was down to five.<br> I've had sex with 22<br> separate species of animals.<br> I've had intercourse<br> with 9,412 people.<br> I've had sexual relations with...<br> Have you ever seen a boy orgasm?<br> No.<br> No, right.<br> I guess that's why I'm such a catch.<br> Physiologically, it's almost identical<br> to an adult orgasm.<br> Screw this.<br> I'll see you down at the bar.<br> I thought you trained them<br> to be impartial.<br> Sometimes it's difficult.<br> Yeah, well,<br> I suppose someone like me...<br> really puts your beliefs<br> to the test, huh?<br> - How?<br> - You know.<br> - Everybody should do what they want.<br> - I've never said that.<br> No one should be forced to do<br> anything against their will.<br> No one should ever be hurt.<br> You know, you're a lot more square<br> than I thought you'd be.<br> Let's get on with it.<br> Sure.<br> Please, Governor.<br> You're so angry, I can't reason with you.<br> When you calm down, we'll discuss it.<br> Seems that the archbishop of Fort Wayne...<br> tipped off the customs board.<br> What is it with these people? They're simply<br> depictions of man in his natural state.<br> I don't know much<br> about natural states, Prok...<br> but here in the state of Indiana<br> we have a problem.<br> We'll just have to take<br> the customs office to court.<br> And who's gonna pay for that,<br> the Rockefeller Foundation?<br> You're an inch away<br> from losing your grant as it is.<br> That's not true.<br> What do you mean?<br> Hoover is still annoyed<br> that you won't help him...<br> find homosexuals<br> in the State Department.<br> It is rumored that he is<br> compiling dossiers... on you...<br> the activities of your staff.<br> And, as you well know, there have been<br> complaints about your statistical methods.<br> Trumped-up nonsense.<br> Nothing but disguised prudery.<br> Prok.<br> Maybe there were small mistakes<br> made in the male study...<br> but we've corrected them<br> in the female volume.<br> This will be a very great book,<br> Herman.<br> - Much better than the first.<br> - Let's hope so.<br> Liberty and license are as far apart...<br> As liberty and tyranny.<br> Kinsey<br> is a deranged Nebuchadnezzar...<br> leading women out into the fields...<br> to mingle with the cattle.<br> "Self-appointed messiah<br> of the sexually despised.<br> "Having had his way<br> with the male of the species...<br> Kinsey now insecticizes<br> American womanhood."<br> Did you get any sleep at all<br> last night?<br> How many years do I have to study<br> human behavior...<br> before I'm no longer an entomologist?<br> - Why do you read them, Prok?<br> - I'm trying to find out why<br> people hate this book so.<br> You told them their grandmothers<br> and their daughters are masturbating...<br> having premarital sex,<br> sex with each other.<br> - What did you expect?<br> - Some respect!<br> Don't answer it.<br> - Hello.<br> - Say, Kinsey, what kind of sick man are you?<br> Why do you wanna go around poking your nose...<br> We're in trouble.<br> The cost of film stock is astronomical.<br> Shouldn't our nonprofit status<br> get us a discount?<br> Prok, you've got to let some of this go.<br> We need a full-time accountant.<br> What in heavens...<br> Stop this!<br> Stop it at once! In my office.<br> Gebhard, get in there.<br> Everyone, back to work.<br> Do you have any idea<br> what a delicate time this is?<br> Our enemies are watching<br> everything we do.<br> We can't afford a single slip-up.<br> This has nothing to do<br> with the project.<br> - Everything is about the project!<br> - Oh, it's just a...<br> - a misunderstanding.<br> - No, it's not.!<br> You let things get out ofhand<br> with Martin's wife...<br> and now she wants to leave him.<br> Isn't that right, Martin?<br> And what about you, Gebhard?<br> Are you planning to leave Agnes and the kids?<br> - No, of course not.<br> - Then end it.<br> - I've tried.<br> - It's not difficult. Just tell her it's over.<br> - No explanation necessary.<br> - All right.<br> Clyde, I'm...<br> I'm very sorry about all of this.<br> I saw this coming.<br> Gebhard should have<br> nipped it in the bud.<br> You are so full of shit!<br> What are we to you, Prok?<br> We'rejust lab rats?<br> Is this just another part<br> of the project...<br> To prove that sex...<br> No. No, I'm sorry.<br> Fucking is...<br> nothing more than...<br> than friction and harmless fun?<br> Well, let me tell you...<br> that is a risky game,<br> because fucking isn't just something.<br> It's the whole thing.<br> And if you're not careful...<br> it will cut you wide open.<br> Go home to your wife, Clyde.<br> She's going to need you.<br> I thought the rules were clear.<br> No intense romantic entanglements.<br> They only make people's lives unstable.<br> I guess we all can't be<br> as disciplined as you, Prok.<br> The question of marital infidelity...<br> The question of marital infidelity...<br> remains one of the most complicated<br> issues facing our society today.<br> Reconciliation<br> of the married individual's desire...<br> for a variety of sexual partners...<br> and the maintenance<br> of a stable marriage...<br> presents a problem which has not been<br> satisfactorily resolved in our culture.<br> The fact is, America is awash<br> in sexual activity...<br> - only a small portion of which<br> is sanctioned by society.<br> Sexual morality<br> needs to be reformed...<br> and science will show the way.<br> Sometimes...<br> I sometimes wonder<br> what this country would look like if...<br> the Puritans had stayed at home.<br> What if all the rogues and libertines...<br> had crossed the Atlantic instead?<br> But the enforcers<br> of chastity are massing once again...<br> to dissuade the scientist,<br> intimidate him...<br> convince him to... cease research.<br> For heaven's sake!<br> - If you could get him...<br> - Yes, Mrs. Kinsey.<br> Mac.<br> He's killing himself.<br> And you have to help me stop him.<br> - Okay.<br> - Hmm?<br> Hi.<br> Doctors say my heart...<br> sounds like a cement mixer.<br> At least they found one.<br> Seems I've developed<br> a dependency on barbiturates.<br> So...<br> if I've been a bit harsh lately...<br> - How's Alice?<br> - She's fine.<br> We're fine.<br> You should get some sleep.<br> It's always been my biggest fear,<br> Clyde...<br> dying before I finish this work.<br> In the course of these hearings<br> on tax-exempt foundations...<br> we intend to show how Communists<br> are financed in the United States.<br> There is a diabolical conspiracy<br> back of all this...<br> and its aim is the furtherance<br> of socialism in America.<br> Do you agree that Kinsey's research...<br> aids the communistic aim...<br> of weakening and destroying<br> the youth of our country?<br> I do not agree, sir.<br> Well, tell me, Dr. Gregg...<br> does the Rockefeller Foundation<br> really believe...<br> that it belongs in the business<br> of sex research?<br> I think it's probably something...<br> the foundation shouldn't<br> have anything to do with.<br> Dr. Kinsey's project<br> is now in a position...<br> to obtain support from...<br> other sources.<br> With the loss of support<br> from the Rockefeller Foundation...<br> Dr. Kinsey's project will need<br> other funding if it is to survive.<br> Prok?<br> Prok, you home?<br> We are running a budget surplus<br> due to increased enrollment...<br> which is a direct result<br> of Dr. Kinsey's success and fame.<br> A small amount of this money...<br> would be enough<br> to keep the project afloat.<br> Prok?<br> - Prok?<br> - Why don't we put it to a vote?<br> All those in favor<br> of increasing Dr. Kinsey's grant?<br> That's it then.<br> This woman was beaten by her father<br> when she first menstruated.<br> Now she's incapable<br> of physical intimacy of any kind.<br> And this man..."Dear Dr. Kinsey...<br> "it has taken me<br> a long time to write to you...<br> I suppose because<br> I was too ashamed and I..."<br> Where'd that blood come from?<br> I punctured my foreskin.<br> I... I wanted to understand different...<br> different kinds of sensations.<br> It, uh... It didn't give me<br> any pleasure.<br> And there...<br> And there was only a little...<br> pain.<br> I couldn't help them, Mac.<br> I couldn't figure it out.<br> Just stop punishing yourself.<br> Now I...<br> I've ruined it for everyone.<br> This is an exercise in futility.<br> Huntington Hartford is heir<br> to the A & P fortune.<br> He can solve your financial problems<br> with the stroke of a pen.<br> I won't beg, Mac.<br> I won't beg.<br> Ohio deplores fellatio but tolerates cunnilingus.<br> Whereas in my home state of Indiana...<br> all forms of oral sex are illegal,<br> even within marriage.<br> Mmm. The current sex laws are completely<br> out of touch with the real worid.<br> I've had four wives.<br> Some people say<br> that makes me a sex offender.<br> Well, Hunt, if you keep interrupting Dr. Kinsey...<br> you're going to have to find a fifth.<br> Please go on.<br> Even now, 43 states will punish<br> a single act of adulterous intercourse.<br> I'm thinking ofbuilding a museum.<br> What's your opinion of modern art,<br> Dr. Kinsey?<br> It's not my area of expertise,<br> Mr. Hartford.<br> - I really don't consider myself<br> qualified to discuss it.<br> - Well, why not?<br> Just because<br> I own some supermarkets...<br> that doesn't mean I'm only capable<br> of talking about groceries.<br> Oh. Do you hate modern art<br> as much as I do?<br> Squiggly lines, empty canvases,<br> white on white.<br> So, the next book will deal<br> with sex offenders?<br> We need money, Mrs. Hartford.<br> We...<br> We need someone to give us money.<br> You have no idea<br> what I've had to endure...<br> just to obtain the same rights<br> other scientists take for granted.<br> My funding has been slashed, and my name<br> has been dragged through the mud...<br> in every newspaper and magazine<br> across this country.<br> Every dollar I've ever earned has...<br> Leave me alone!<br> Every dollar I've ever<br> made has gone back into the project.<br> But fighting this customs case has cost us<br> an appalling amount. We're broke.<br> - Dr. Kinsey...<br> - Please.<br> I'm not even sure<br> how much time I have left.<br> Help me.<br> I have to get it all on the record.<br> Well, I'm very sorry.<br> Any support I give might be misconstrued<br> as an endorsement of sex.<br> I can't afford that kind of exposure.<br> I see.<br> But I'm sure something<br> will come through.<br> You're right.<br> Rich people have lazy minds.<br> Took them five minutes<br> to find a water glass.<br> - I'm taking you to the hospital.<br> - Mm-mm. Mm-mmm.<br> No. No more beds.<br> I spent my whole childhood<br> lying in bed.<br> Let's go back to the hotel, Mac.<br> I wanna pick up a few histories<br> in the morning.<br> We'd been married for 23 years,<br> with three marvelous children.<br> And as soon as my youngest<br> left to go to college...<br> I took a job in an arts foundation.<br> I met a woman there...<br> secretary in the grants office.<br> We became fast friends, and...<br> before long,<br> I fell in love with her.<br> Hmm. This came as quite a shock,<br> as you might imagine.<br> The more I tried to ignore it...<br> the more... powerful it became.<br> You have no idea...<br> what it's like<br> to have your own thoughts...<br> turn against you like that.<br> I couldn't talk to anyone<br> about my situation...<br> so I found other ways to cope.<br> Uh, I took up drinking.<br> Eventually, my husband left me.<br> Even my children fell away.<br> I came very close to... ending it all.<br> It's just another reminder<br> of how little...<br> things have changed in our society.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Things have gotten much better.<br> Oh? What happened?<br> Why, you did, of course.<br> After I read your book, I realized...<br> how many other women<br> were in the same situation.<br> I mustered the courage<br> to talk to my friend...<br> and she told me,<br> to my great surprise...<br> that the feelings were mutual.<br> We-We've been together<br> for three happy years now.<br> You saved my life, sir.<br> Just, uh, one more question.<br> You'vejust told me your entire history...<br> childhood, family, career...<br> every person you've ever had sex with...<br> but there hasn't been<br> a single mention of love.<br> That's because it's impossible<br> to measure love.<br> And as you know, without measurements,<br> there can be no science.<br> But I've been thinking a lot<br> about the problem lately.<br> Oh. Problem?<br> When it comes to love,<br> we're all in the dark.<br> So, you do think it matters?<br> What time's our flight, Mac?<br> Not for a couple of hours.<br> Let's stop in the woods.<br> Mac?<br> I'm right here, Prok.<br> Just imagine...<br> these trees<br> are over a thousand years old.<br> Hence the name:<br> Sequoia sempervirens...<br> always green, always alive.<br> Mac, did I ever tell you<br> about the Mbeere?<br> No, not that I recall.<br> They're an ancient East African tribe.<br> They believe that trees<br> are imperfect men...<br> eternally bemoaning<br> their imprisonment...<br> the roots that keep them<br> stuck in one place.<br> But I've never seen<br> a discontented tree.<br> Look at this one... the way its roots<br> are gripping the ground.<br> I believe it really loves it.<br> Come on, Mac.<br> What's the hurry?<br> There's a lot of work to do.<br>
