                        Christmas Eve in New York.<br> A happy time<br> for some people... the lucky ones.<br> Last-minute shopping,<br> presents for the kids...<br> hurry home to light the tree<br> and fill the stockings... for the lucky ones.<br> Others aren't so lucky.<br> Nick Bianco hadn't worked for a year.<br> He had a record... a prison record.<br> They say it shouldn't count against you...<br> but when Nick tried to get a job...<br> the same thing<br> always happened: "Very sorry."<br> No prejudice, of course,<br> but no job either.<br> So this is how Nick went Christmas shopping<br> for his kids.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Don't move.<br> Put your hands behind you.<br> - Come on.<br> - What about the safe?<br> We've got enough. Come on.<br> - Didn't you ring?<br> - Take it easy. I rang.<br> - Anybody out at four?<br> - Yeah.<br> This isn't the lobby, mister.<br> All right, miss.<br> Stand back. Stand back.<br> Everybody stand back.<br> Everybody stand back.<br> Stand back.<br> The same thing happened<br> 20 years ago to Nick's father.<br> He died with a policeman's<br> bullet in him. Nick saw it.<br> It was one of his earliest memories.<br> Yeah?<br> - Shelby's here with Nick Bianco.<br> - Send 'em in, both of 'em.<br> Hello, Bianco. How's the leg?<br> All better, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Sit here.<br> - You know who I am?<br> - What difference does it make?<br> - Never mind getting fresh, Bianco.<br> - You're the D.A.<br> Assistant. My name is Louis D'Angelo.<br> Let's see what we got here.<br> "Bianco, Nick. Age 29.<br> "At the age of 17,<br> burglary in the first. Plea: Guilty.<br> "Sixty days in the city reformatory.<br> "Four years later, grand larceny<br> in the first, charged.<br> "Convicted of grand<br> in the second at the trial.<br> "Two and one half to five years<br> in Sing Sing.<br> "Third charge:<br> Robbery in the first while armed.<br> Witness failed to appear. Case dropped."<br> By the way, how much do witnesses cost<br> on the open market now?<br> - How should I know?<br> - Do you know why you're here?<br> I'm supposed to squeal.<br> I want the names of those three men<br> that were with you on that job.<br> You know what you're gonna get on this rap?<br> Fifteen years. Maybe 20.<br> - Maybe I can help you.<br> - Look, you're wasting your time.<br> Those records you got there ain't complete.<br> It should say I was offered a deal by<br> another assistant D.A. If I squealed.<br> I took the full four years.<br> I'm the same guy now I was then.<br> Nothing has changed. Nothing.<br> I wouldn't say that, Nick.<br> Something has changed since then.<br> Seems to me I saw where the parole officer<br> reported here that...<br> you have two kids.<br> Two little girls.<br> That ought to change things a little.<br> You know, sometimes I think the doctors<br> are right, and that all crooks are crazy.<br> - Imagine a guy with two little girls...<br> - Shut up!<br> He don't like that.<br> How old are they?<br> You know, I'm always interested in kids.<br> I... I have four of my own.<br> Here.<br> - Can I take a look at your pictures?<br> - What pictures?<br> Pictures you got<br> in your inside coat pocket.<br> - Beautiful kids, Nick.<br> - Yeah, they're cute.<br> You know, a man's lucky to have kids.<br> But having a father like you<br> I wouldn't say is very lucky for them.<br> No, Nick, your kids<br> haven't had much luck.<br> I'll take care of my family... my way.<br> You mean by keeping your mouth shut<br> and going to jail?<br> You know why you're doing it?<br> Because you've got that good old<br> hoodlum complex... no squealing.<br> Desert your kids. Let 'em starve.<br> Let your home go to pot.<br> But don't squeal on some no-good hoodlums<br> who wouldn't turn a finger for you.<br> - I hate crooks.<br> - Then why are you wasting your time on me?<br> Because any guy that could have two kids<br> like that isn't a crook.<br> Crooked, yes. Stupid, yes.<br> On the wrong foot, yes.<br> But he isn't one of those mugs<br> that don't belong to human society.<br> Those are two normal,<br> decent little human beings.<br> - Give me that!<br> - And no crook could make 'em that sweet.<br> - No play ball, eh?<br> - No!<br> - You're coming up before Judge Halstead.<br> Do you know him?<br> - Yes.<br> - He'll throw the book at you<br> if you don't cooperate.<br> - No deal.<br> See you in court, Bianco.<br> - Attorney for Nick Bianco?<br> - Yep.<br> This way, please.<br> - How are you, Nick?<br> - How do you do, Mr. Howser?<br> I'm fine, son.<br> Sit down, son, sit down.<br> Well, we meet again, Nick.<br> Fortunes of war, eh?<br> I, uh... I hear you had a long talk<br> with Mr. D'Angelo.<br> - You don't have to worry.<br> - Good. Good. Your word's all I need.<br> - Did the boys pay you?<br> - Everything's been taken care of.<br> Now, uh, I don't want you<br> to expect very much in court.<br> - We've got no defense at all.<br> - So what do I do?<br> Nothing. Trust me. Even when Halstead<br> hits you with the book...<br> stand pat, rely on me.<br> I begin to work then.<br> - On the parole?<br> - Yes.<br> It may take a while, but<br> I'll have you out in no time.<br> - Did you see the missus?<br> - I talked to her on the phone.<br> - She'll be in court.<br> - Thanks.<br> Are the kids all right,<br> do you happen to know?<br> - They're fine.<br> - Good.<br> You can rely on me, Nick.<br> - Same goes for me, Mr. Howser.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Look at that cheap squirt<br> passing up and down.<br> What for?<br> They have to keep passing up<br> and down here all the time?<br> For a nickel, I'd grab him...<br> stick both thumbs right in his eyes...<br> and hang on till he drops dead.<br> - You're Nick Bianco, ain't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> Howser was telling me.<br> You're a big man.<br> I'm Tommy Udo.<br> - I've heard of you.<br> - You did, huh? Huh.<br> Imagine me in on this cheap rap,<br> big man like me.<br> Picked up just for<br> shoving a guy's ears off his head.<br> Traffic ticket stuff.<br> Hello, Bianco. You got a minute?<br> I wouldn't give you the skin off a grape.<br> Gonna be a stiff sentence, Nick.<br> You better be set.<br> - I'm set.<br> - You know, I wasn't fooling<br> when I talked with you.<br> - I liked those pictures you showed me.<br> - Thanks.<br> I talked with the judge. He'll play ball.<br> - Well?<br> - No deal.<br> Okay.<br> If you should change your mind<br> later on though, let me hear.<br> Remember my name<br> and get in touch with me.<br> You know, I'm your insurance policy.<br> You don't give up, do you?<br> I usually do.<br> But I tried a little extra hard this time.<br> What do you know?<br> I just remembered something.<br> It's my birthday. Yeah, today.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - No kidding.<br> I'll tell you something, big man...<br> I never spent a birthday<br> with a better guy.<br> When I heard that you<br> spit in that judge's face...<br> I says to myself,<br> a buddy... a stand-up guy.<br> - You talk too much.<br> - In front of these squirts?<br> Go on, a couple of dopey cops.<br> I don't even know they're sitting there.<br> Come on. Cheer up, big man.<br> It's my birthday party.<br> We get a free feed tonight.<br> Ossining. Next stop is Ossining.<br> Yes. Next stop, Ossining.<br> Plenty of jobs here...<br> even for the unlucky ones.<br> And no prejudice.<br> - From the old lady, Nick?<br> - No. I got my own back again.<br> - That's the second one, ain't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> She hasn't written for three months.<br> It says, "party no longer at this address."<br> It just doesn't make sense.<br> Now, take it easy,<br> Nick. Quit stewing.<br> Everything was all right three months ago.<br> She wrote and said<br> everything was all right.<br> Then all of a sudden, I...<br> I've got to find out about it.<br> You can find out. Ask Chips Cooney.<br> You know him, don't you?<br> Used to, but how am I gonna ask him?<br> Well, he's coming up here on a new rap.<br> The kids.<br> She knows how I worry about 'em.<br> She oughta write.<br> Hey, Nick.<br> Chips Cooney.<br> Harry. Get to Chips Cooney.<br> See if he knows<br> what's happened to my missus.<br> - She's dead.<br> - Dead? What happened?<br> I don't know.<br> There are some things...<br> you just don't want to talk about.<br> I kept away as long as I could...<br> and then finally<br> one Sunday afternoon...<br> I got the courage<br> and went up to see him.<br> Take a seat, please, miss.<br> Send in A-106180.<br> Check.<br> Hello, Nick.<br> - Well, don't you remember me?<br> - Sure.<br> Nettie.<br> - You used to take care of my kids.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - How are you?<br> - I'm all right.<br> Nick, I-I moved away<br> before it happened.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Maria and I had a fight...<br> and then a few weeks later, I moved away.<br> Then...<br> just two weeks ago, I found out about it.<br> - I met a former neighbor.<br> - She told you?<br> Yes.<br> I felt so bad about the kids.<br> I inquired to the police,<br> and I found out that...<br> Well, they sent me to a place,<br> and I found out they're all right.<br> - You saw the kids?<br> - Yes.<br> - And they're all right?<br> - Oh, yes. They look swell.<br> - Where are they?<br> - In an orphanage outside<br> of New York. A big place.<br> I was gonna write<br> and tell you about it...<br> and then I thought<br> maybe I'd better come see you.<br> I-I feel so sorry about everything, Nick.<br> Tell me about Maria.<br> She wasn't feeling very well<br> when I saw her the last time.<br> - What did you fight about?<br> - Oh, uh, I don't remember anymore.<br> - Okay.<br> - I don't. Honestly.<br> Was she unhappy?<br> Oh, yes.<br> - Drinking?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Anything else?<br> - No. No, no, no.<br> What happened? You came here<br> to tell me what happened.<br> Why did you change your mind?<br> Scared of hurting me?<br> Look, Nettie...<br> I'm the kind of guy you can't hurt.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Oh, Nick!<br> You told me.<br> Who is the guy?<br> Rizzo.<br> Rizzo.<br> I had to come see you. I don't know why.<br> I'm sorry. I don't wanna cry.<br> Nobody's cried over me for a long time.<br> Rizzo.<br> When did it start? No. Never mind.<br> Is there... Is there anything<br> I can do for you?<br> - Yeah. Will you see the kids again?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Tell 'em you heard from me...<br> and I'm supposed to be<br> working in South America.<br> - Do that, will you?<br> - Yes. Yes, that's what I used to tell 'em...<br> before I moved away.<br> Are you... alone?<br> Yes.<br> I-I got a good job in a music store.<br> Oh. Well, Nettie,<br> thanks for coming to see me.<br> Good-bye.<br> - I'll write you soon.<br> - Thanks.<br> "Nick Bianco. Urgent business."<br> - Did he write this himself?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good handwriting.<br> - He's not a bad guy.<br> - Bring him in.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All right, Bianco.<br> Well, Nick, you haven't been in here before,<br> but I've had good reports on you.<br> Something's gone wrong, I suppose.<br> All right, Nick. Get it off your chest.<br> Well, I used up all my<br> letters for this month...<br> but they came back saying the person<br> no longer lived at the address.<br> I'd like to send another letter off.<br> I was told that<br> you had to give permission.<br> That's right, if it's urgent.<br> Yes, sir. It's very urgent.<br> - Who is the letter going to?<br> - To the assistant D.A., Mr. D'Angelo.<br> Hmm. Better let me send it.<br> He'll read it sooner.<br> Yes, sir. You can send it.<br> Tell him that Nick Bianco wants to<br> cash in on his insurance policy.<br> - Nothing else?<br> - No, sir. He'll understand that.<br> - I'll send it this afternoon.<br> - Thanks.<br> Oh, Nick. You need<br> a little more exercise.<br> How about putting Bianco<br> on the ball team, Joe?<br> - We can use him.<br> - You play ball?<br> I'm going to. Thank you, sir.<br> Hello, Bianco. Have a seat.<br> - How are you?<br> - All right.<br> You have a nice ride, Bianco?<br> Warden phoned me, said he thought<br> it might be important.<br> - Is it?<br> - Yeah. Yes, sir.<br> "Yeah" will do.<br> Before we get to talking, Bianco,<br> there are a few things I'd like to explain.<br> Three years ago, I offered to help you.<br> I'm in no position<br> to offer the same help now.<br> I see.<br> My insurance policy has lapsed, eh?<br> I would say so.<br> I see.<br> - Well, that's that, huh?<br> - That's that.<br> - What about my kids?<br> - How do you mean?<br> - Could I get to see them?<br> - As payment?<br> I'm not doing this for pay. I'm asking you<br> if I could get to see them as a favor.<br> - I think we can take care of that.<br> - Then I can see the kids?<br> I'm pretty sure.<br> Okay.<br> I want to settle one more thing<br> before you talk, Bianco.<br> We get a lot of offers from men in prison<br> who feel they'd like to do a little squealing.<br> Prisoners go a little cracked<br> or like a little ride into town.<br> You knew what you wanted once.<br> I'd like to know what changed you.<br> It will give me a chance to decide on...<br> whether your story's reliable<br> enough to go to work on.<br> When I went up, I told you my family<br> was being taken care of.<br> I was wrong.<br> My wife killed herself.<br> She stuck her head in a gas stove.<br> You wanna talk about<br> the Peacock Jewelry job?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who else was on it?<br> - Eddie Williams.<br> - Big Ed?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who else?<br> - Tony Mangone.<br> - Know him?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who else?<br> Pete... Rizzo.<br> - Rizzo, eh?<br> - Who else?<br> - Me.<br> - Any more?<br> - No.<br> - Who drove the car?<br> - Pete Rizzo.<br> - You, Mangone and Williams went in, is that it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Who slugged old man Peacock?<br> - Mangone.<br> If it's on the level, Peacock's a cinch<br> to identify Mangone and Williams.<br> Who was the fence<br> you used on this job?<br> I don't know. I didn't handle it.<br> I was grabbed before.<br> - That's right. Who would've handled it?<br> - Rizzo.<br> - Would Rizzo have gone to the fence direct?<br> - No.<br> You called somebody first,<br> and they told you where to go?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who did you phone?<br> - Howser.<br> - Earl Howser.<br> Another eminent shyster<br> with connections that ought to...<br> I think I'm gonna keep you down here<br> in the city jail a while.<br> I want you to go on cooperating with us.<br> You mean go on being a stoolie?<br> - That's what I mean.<br> - Okay...<br> - if...<br> - If what?<br> - I could see my kids once in a while.<br> - You can see them.<br> When your pals get pulled in...<br> they're gonna make a pretty good guess<br> you did the singing.<br> - I don't care.<br> - I do. No sense in getting you killed.<br> There are one or two things<br> we can do to throw them off.<br> What's some job you did<br> that you didn't get caught on?<br> - What? Some...<br> - You've got to trust me.<br> Thompson Fur Company,<br> four years ago last March.<br> Were any of these three<br> on that job with you?<br> - Rizzo.<br> - We'll book Bianco on the Thompson Fur job.<br> - That'll cover why we brought him here.<br> - And I take another rap?<br> No, no. We'll drop the case later<br> for insufficient evidence.<br> - I'm just covering you.<br> - Why?<br> I told you. I'm gonna wanna use you again.<br> You've got to be in the clear with Howser<br> and everybody that knows you.<br> - I'll pick up Rizzo.<br> - No. Leave him alone. Don't touch him.<br> Rizzo drove the car. There's no one<br> to identify him except Nick here.<br> That won't stand up.<br> You pick up the other two.<br> Then it'll look to the mob as if Rizzo's<br> the stoolie and we've made a deal with him.<br> - You don't like Rizzo particularly, do you?<br> - No.<br> Let me give you some instructions, Nick.<br> Get ahold of your lawyer, Mr. Earl Howser.<br> Tell him about the Thompson rap.<br> Tell him you think somebody has squealed.<br> Yeah.<br> Your side of the fence<br> is almost as dirty as mine.<br> With one big difference...<br> We hurt bad people, not good ones.<br> - That's right.<br> - Watch your step with Howser.<br> He's a sharp operator.<br> And remember, you're no good to me<br> if he tumbles to anything.<br> He won't tumble.<br> When do I see my kids?<br> I'll take care of that tomorrow.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, I... I'm a squealer now.<br> Feel bad about it, Nick?<br> - No.<br> - Come on.<br> - See you later.<br> - So long.<br> - I'm nervous.<br> - Don't worry.<br> They used to jump up on me<br> and grab my ears, and I used to...<br> - Good morning, Sister.<br> - Good morning.<br> We're from the district attorney's office.<br> I phoned the mother superior yesterday<br> about seeing the Bianco children?<br> - Yes, I know. Will you come with me, please?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Will you wait in here, please?<br> - Thank you.<br> Which one of you gentlemen is Mr. Bianco?<br> That's me.<br> How do you do? I'll get Sister Veronica.<br> - Not a bad place for kids.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Sister Veronica?<br> - Yes. This is your father.<br> I know. I recognized him.<br> - Hello, Father.<br> - Hello.<br> Connie.<br> - Rosie.<br> - Sister Veronica told us you were coming today.<br> - You've been away a very long time.<br> - You look different.<br> I thought you would have white hair.<br> No, I ain't.<br> Aren't you going to kiss your father?<br> Oh, Daddy!<br> Nobody else here has a daddy,<br> have they, Sister Veronica? Nobody else.<br> Daddy, Mama got hurt,<br> and we waited for you...<br> and said prayers for you every night,<br> and God sent you back.<br> They're having<br> their music lesson, Mr. Bianco.<br> Would you care to come in the next room<br> and listen to them play the piano?<br> Yeah.<br> Take it easy.<br> Sister Theresa, would you let Concetta<br> have her lesson first?<br> Why, of course, Sister.<br> Will you please wait over there, Eileen?<br> - All right, Sister.<br> - Thank you, dear. Come on.<br> I play The Waterfall.<br> Rosaria is way back yet.<br> - May I play it, Sister Veronica?<br> - Of course, dear.<br> Bianco, somebody to see you.<br> - Who?<br> - Your lawyer, Earl Howser.<br> Oh.<br> Well, well, we meet again, eh?<br> Glad to see you, Nick.<br> I received your rather surprising<br> message this morning.<br> May I tell you, I dropped everything<br> and came right over.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Sit down, son. Sit down.<br> How, uh... how long<br> have they had you here?<br> Since yesterday.<br> Well, we can say this much for it.<br> It's a change at least.<br> - I don't like it.<br> - Of course not.<br> I was just making a bad joke.<br> Uh, you... you've had<br> quite a lot of trouble, I hear...<br> besides this.<br> I mean about your wife.<br> Yeah. Maybe it wouldn't have happened<br> if you'd done your job like you said.<br> Oh, you mean, uh, about your parole?<br> - Yeah, that's what I mean.<br> - I've been pushing it. I'm gonna get it.<br> I gave you my word, and I still give it to you.<br> - I'm going to put that parole through.<br> - Just so you keep plugging.<br> Now, uh, let's hear<br> about this new trouble.<br> - Have they made any specific charge?<br> - Yeah.<br> The Thompson Fur Company heist four years ago.<br> Oh. That's reaching back.<br> - Somebody must have it in for you.<br> - That's one way of looking at it.<br> How do you look at it?<br> Somebody's doing some squealing.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Who's handling this in the D.A.'s office?<br> - D'Angelo.<br> - Oh, our old friend.<br> You think he's finally<br> got ahold of a squealer?<br> That's what I think.<br> Were you under suspicion<br> for the Thompson job at the time?<br> - No.<br> - I see.<br> Who were you running around with<br> in those days, Nick?<br> I used to hang around with Pete Rizzo.<br> - He was your partner?<br> - Yeah. Rizzo was my partner.<br> Pete Rizzo. Hmm.<br> Did D'Angelo mention his name<br> when he talked to you?<br> Nobody mentioned his name.<br> I don't think they've got<br> much of a case, Nick.<br> When D'Angelo finds out that he's not<br> going to scare you out of anything...<br> I'll wager he drops it.<br> I hope so. That's all I need<br> is another rap hung on me.<br> - I'll never get my parole.<br> - Oh, everything's going to be all right.<br> I'll see you in a week, Nick. If they start<br> roughing you up, let me know.<br> - I can take care of myself.<br> - Fine.<br> Good-bye, Nick.<br> Fred? Are you alone?<br> Get hold of Tommy Udo on the phone.<br> No. Tell him I want to see him.<br> No, not here. He'll know where.<br> Yes. Right away.<br> It's open.<br> - You a friend of Peter?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where's the squirt?<br> - Not home.<br> Come home late tonight maybe.<br> After dinner sometime... maybe.<br> - Where'd he go to?<br> - Peter?<br> How I know<br> where Peter go?<br> Uptown? Downtown?<br> Baseball game? Anywhere.<br> Back after dinner sometime, huh?<br> Double-crossing squealers, both of you.<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't know nothing.<br> So the yellow squirt beat it, huh?<br> Took a powder, huh?<br> That rat.<br> Where is he?<br> Where'd he go?<br> I'm asking you, where's that<br> squealing son of yours?<br> Huh.<br> You think a squealer<br> can get away from me, huh?<br> You know what I do to squealers?<br> I let 'em have it in the belly...<br> so they can roll around<br> for a long time, thinking it over.<br> You're worse than him...<br> telling me he's coming back.<br> You lying old hag.<br> Huh.<br> No! No. I'm sick!<br> Let me go. No.<br> - On a train, huh?<br> - Hey. Where you going?<br> - No! No!<br> - This is for knowing a squealer.<br> Not outside!<br> I can't move! I'm sick!<br> - You ain't sick.<br> - No! No!<br> No!<br> Hello? Yes?<br> You ain't gonna be bothered with<br> that squealer for a long time.<br> Yeah. He skipped town<br> before I got there.<br> 'Cause he's gonna<br> read something in the papers...<br> and it's gonna make him take off<br> for South America, the squirt.<br> Never mind, Early.<br> You'll read it too.<br> All right, Tom. Just so you're sure<br> there isn't going to be any more talking.<br> Fine. Good work.<br> - Is Miss Nettie Cavallo home?<br> - I'll see.<br> Is that for me, Mrs. Keller?<br> Yes. There's a gentleman to see you.<br> Nick. Oh, for goodness' sakes.<br> Hello.<br> If there's a phone call<br> for Nick Bianco, that's me.<br> - Will you call me, please?<br> - Sure.<br> Come on in, please.<br> Oh, Nick, I can<br> hardly believe it. You're out.<br> When? You didn't tell me last week.<br> I didn't know last week.<br> They just told me this morning.<br> Oh, Nick, it's wonderful to see you like this,<br> like you used to be.<br> - I mean, not inside a jail or anything.<br> - I know.<br> I came right here. I was hoping<br> you'd be home.<br> Oh, I almost went to the movies.<br> I was just thinking...<br> Oh, Nick, what happened?<br> - I got a parole.<br> - No! Oh, that's wonderful.<br> - Have you had dinner?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> You must be hungry.<br> I'll get you something to eat.<br> Wait. Oh, I've waited.<br> Mr. Bianco! Your call!<br> - Thanks! I'll be right down!<br> - Oh. Wait.<br> Mr. Bianco? Your call!<br> Hello? Yeah.<br> Nick, I thought you might<br> be interested to know that...<br> I just had a call from Mr. Howser.<br> Yeah. He wanted to do a little crowing<br> about your parole.<br> He thinks he got it over my dead body.<br> I let him go right on thinking so. Mm-hmm.<br> Nick, about tonight.<br> Your man will be at St. Nicholas Arena<br> at ringside. Got it?<br> I got it.<br> Okay. I will.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Good-bye.<br> I've got to go.<br> Oh, Nick, where?<br> Couldn't we go for dinner?<br> - Not tonight.<br> - Oh, Nick, don't go away like this.<br> I've got to.<br> Nick, I don't want anything to happen.<br> Look, you've got to trust me.<br> Then tell me where you're going. Please.<br> I can't. I don't want you to know.<br> - I thought you wanted me.<br> I thought when you kissed me...<br> - You thought right.<br> I want you, and I want my kids too.<br> But you've got to trust me.<br> I'm on a job.<br> I might not see you for a while.<br> Hey, stop looking at me like that.<br> Look at me the way you did upstairs.<br> I'll need that look. Come on.<br> - Oh, Nick.<br> - That-a-girl.<br> I'll see you as soon as I can.<br> Come on, squirt.<br> Rip his eye out.<br> Rip it out of his head!<br> Rip it out of his head.<br> Tear it out.<br> Come on. Rip the other eye. Come on.<br> Come on. Rip the other eye. Come on.<br> Come on. Come on. Tear it out of his head.<br> One, two, three...<br> - Cut the shoving.<br> - Hey, Nick, it's me.<br> - Hiya, Tommy.<br> - What do you know? The big man.<br> Let's get out of here so we can talk, huh?<br> Come on, baby.<br> Hello, Tommy. How are you?<br> Come on. Right inside.<br> - Your table, Tommy.<br> - Okay. Okay.<br> - Waiter.<br> - Champagne, lots of bottles. We're celebrating.<br> All right, Tommy.<br> You'll be jumpin' in a couple hours.<br> Always hard when you first get out.<br> Takes a while to get started.<br> This place will do it.<br> Always come here when I'm sprung.<br> What a big man, that Early Howser, huh?<br> Remember what I told ya? Take your rap,<br> leave it to Early. Always gets you out.<br> - Here you are, Mr. Udo.<br> - "Mr. Udo."<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - How do you like that, huh?<br> That's class, huh?<br> Ain't been to bed for a week.<br> Can't stand sleeping. That's for squirts.<br> Haven't I met you<br> somewheres before, Mr. Bianco?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Don't stick your nose in, Buster.<br> We're talkin'. We're pals.<br> Hey, waiter, bring another bottle.<br> Keep 'em coming.<br> How do you like that music, man?<br> Right upstairs, huh? Come on. Send it, Jack.<br> Uh, what do you got to do, Nick?<br> - What's on the line?<br> - I ain't figured it out yet.<br> Gotta have some fun first.<br> I'm behind three years.<br> That's talkin'. That's talkin'.<br> - Heard about me, didn't you?<br> - No.<br> In all the papers.<br> Picked me up for a murder rap.<br> - Was in all the papers.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah, sure. Ask her.<br> - Sure. The papers wrote all<br> about Tommy, with his picture...<br> - The one I don't like.<br> - What do you mean you don't like it?<br> - What's the matter with it?<br> - I don't like it when they<br> show you with the number.<br> Go on. Who notices that?<br> A lot of squirts.<br> - I like the one we took together.<br> - Nobody asked you.<br> Listen, I'm gonna be busy. You go home.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Who you talking to?<br> Get out. I'm with a pal, see?<br> Got things to do.<br> Don't want no old ladies around.<br> - You ain't calling me an old lady?<br> - Get out.<br> You want something?<br> No. No.<br> Wait in your joint for me.<br> Don't go out. You understand?<br> Wait in your joint for me.<br> Don't go out. You understand?<br> Yeah.<br> - A lot of good this mug's gonna do you.<br> - Beat it.<br> Dames are no good<br> if you wanna have some fun.<br> Come on, pal.<br> Drink up, drink up, drink up.<br> - They let you go, huh?<br> - Who?<br> Oh, the bulls. Yeah, sure.<br> There was this squirt says he seen me<br> bending over Larry Young...<br> right after he was plugged.<br> Then he says he ain't sure<br> it was me he seen.<br> Larry Young. He used to own<br> a big caf joint, didn't he?<br> A squirt. Pushing<br> the wrong guys around.<br> He got it good...<br> him and his college rings.<br> Yeah. He was with a college gang?<br> I didn't know that.<br> Nah, not a gang.<br> Not a gang. A ring... ring on his finger.<br> Worth a couple of bucks.<br> This joint's dead. It's sour.<br> You want to have fun, don't you?<br> So we get out of here, go someplace where<br> they got some interest.<br> - What do you say, pal?<br> - I'm three years behind.<br> That's it.<br> Stick to me, big man. You'll catch up.<br> Come on. We'll shake this dumb joint.<br> Okay, Mac. Come on.<br> - Hello, Mr. Sulla.<br> - Hello, Tommy.<br> He's a pal. It's okay.<br> Thanks. Come on, Nick.<br> - What's that funny smell?<br> - That's perfume.<br> After we left the first joint,<br> he began to talk.<br> He said he'd done the Larry Young job.<br> - Alone?<br> - Yeah.<br> He didn't know the guy's name that hired him.<br> He never saw him before.<br> - Did he describe him?<br> - No. I couldn't push that.<br> - So you got nothing?<br> - Go on, Nick.<br> Well, there's two things.<br> He copped a ring off Larry Young...<br> a gold ring from some college.<br> His girl, Buster's, got it,<br> but she never wears it.<br> It's no good except as a souvenir.<br> Then there's the guy that saw the shooting,<br> a fella Udo knows called Sammy...<br> sort of a panhandler.<br> He was coming up to get a buck off<br> Larry Young when Udo came along.<br> Udo said Sammy<br> saw the shooting and beat it.<br> - Sammy who?<br> - I don't know his last name.<br> Well, that does it.<br> All we've got to do is find Sammy...<br> produce the ring, we've got a case.<br> - Congratulations, Nick.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You had quite a time, didn't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> I wouldn't wanna go through that again.<br> I don't think you'll have to.<br> - That's all?<br> - That's all.<br> You might find out about Sammy<br> by asking some of Larry Young's friends.<br> We may do that.<br> So long.<br> Nick.<br> - Everything all right?<br> - Yeah. I'm gonna be all right.<br> Daddy, stay there!<br> All right.<br> Hurry up.<br> Don't fall. Come on.<br> Hey!<br> Whoo!<br> Hey, watch it!<br> Agh! Oops!<br> - Whoa! Whoa!<br> - Daddy! Whoa!<br> Don't come in the house until you get<br> those skates off, or I'll bop ya one.<br> Nettie?<br> Hi.<br> - Hey, hey. I ain't cleaned up yet.<br> - Oh, who cares?<br> Look. Old married ladies don't jump on<br> their husbands in public.<br> Aw, I'm not old, and I'm not a lady.<br> - I'll get the girls.<br> - They're takin' off their skates.<br> - How've they been?<br> - Wonderful.<br> Nick, you're not going to wash in the sink.<br> We have a bathroom.<br> Yeah, but the kids are usin' it.<br> This'll be okay.<br> Hey, get those suds off more.<br> - What do you want me to do? Drown?<br> - That's right. More yet.<br> - Look. Look. I ain't five and a half years old.<br> - That's what you think.<br> Here. Let me dry you.<br> Mm. Feels good. But it ain't very practical.<br> Give me that towel.<br> You know, there may be worse jobs than<br> in a brickyard, but there ain't many dirtier.<br> - It must be awful.<br> - It ain't awful.<br> Come here.<br> In the kitchen? Oh, Nick!<br> You know, I ain't the kind of guy<br> that's used to sittin' around home.<br> - I know. It worries me sometimes.<br> - It does, huh?<br> Mm-hmm. Of course. Your coming home<br> every night to just... nothing.<br> - That's right.<br> - No excitement or anything.<br> That's right. Every day the same<br> as every other day.<br> Nick, please don't make me worry<br> too much.<br> That's what I need: Someone to worry<br> about me all the time.<br> Don't you let me<br> get away for one minute.<br> Or maybe I'll start bustin' into<br> jewelry stores with a rod in my hand.<br> - That's what you think, huh?<br> - Oh, no, Nick. You wouldn't.<br> - Maybe I wouldn't. But you hang on.<br> - Oh, I will.<br> I'm mad about you.<br> That's all I think of... you.<br> I've wanted you<br> ever since I was a girl long ago.<br> When I used to look at you,<br> I'd feel just like now.<br> Every time you kiss me, I almost pass out.<br> Honestly.<br> Isn't that silly for an old married woman<br> to talk like that?<br> No, it ain't.<br> I gotta make dinner.<br> - Who's stoppin' ya?<br> - I'm dizzy.<br> Here. You open this.<br> - Oh, I forgot! There was a phone call for you.<br> - Yeah? Who?<br> Mr. D'Angelo.<br> - What'd he want?<br> - He wants to see you Saturday afternoon.<br> - Did he say what for?<br> - No.<br> It couldn't have been anything wrong.<br> He was very nice.<br> Oh, for goodness' sakes,<br> I don't know what I'm looking for.<br> You get me so upset.<br> You shouldn't come in the kitchen...<br> and kiss me when<br> I've got dinner to cook.<br> Oh, yes! The spaghetti!<br> Now, leave me alone. Don't bother me.<br> We go to trial on Monday. I've arranged<br> for you to get Wednesday off from work.<br> You say you got a sure case?<br> I wouldn't go to trial otherwise.<br> - Then what do you need me for?<br> - I need your evidence first.<br> - I've built the whole case that way.<br> - Evidence from a stoolie...<br> and a squealer?<br> - That's not gonna help.<br> - We've got the ring. We've got Sammy.<br> - That's not gonna help.<br> - We've got the ring. We've got Sammy.<br> And they'll verify everything you say<br> when we introduce them.<br> I see. I go on the stand, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> - What if I don't?<br> - You've got no choice.<br> Do you mean the D.A.'ll kill my parole?<br> What would you expect, Nick?<br> I've got kids. I got a home.<br> People know me like that.<br> Look, I don't care about me.<br> Why... Why take it out on 'em<br> just because I was a mug once?<br> - Will you listen to me.<br> - Well, I...<br> Go ahead. I... It makes no difference.<br> I've got no other way out.<br> You're talkin' like a fool, Nick.<br> You're known as Nick Cavallo in your town.<br> Your kids are going to school under that name.<br> Who's gonna connect you<br> with Nick Bianco? And how?<br> - My pictures in the newspapers.<br> - There won't be any pictures.<br> - How do you know?<br> - We won't let them take any.<br> We won't give any out.<br> Satisfied?<br> Well, that'll help.<br> What's the matter now?<br> I... Nothing. I was just thinking of Udo.<br> When he finds out...<br> Look, Nick, I know it isn't gonna be fun,<br> but remember this:<br> When it's over, you'll be through.<br> Yeah. That's something.<br> I'll try and remember that when I'm<br> on the witness stand singing.<br> - Hello, Rosie.<br> - Hi, Johnny!<br> Come on, Daddy. Play "train" with us.<br> Come on, Daddy. Please?<br> Aw, Daddy, come on. Please.<br> Not now.<br> Daddy, please. Come on.<br> Play "train" with us.<br> Hello? Yeah, this is Nick.<br> Well, Nick, I...<br> I got some bad news for ya.<br> The jury came in a half hour ago<br> with a verdict in the Udo case.<br> Not guilty.<br> - Hello? Nick?<br> - Yeah.<br> Even the fact that Udo<br> had Larry Young's ring didn't help.<br> Howser got over the point that there were<br> made for Young's graduating class.<br> The jury went for it.<br> Udo went free<br> as soon as the verdict was read.<br> We got a tail on him, but he's pretty fast.<br> He might shake him,<br> so keep your eyes open.<br> You'd better come in<br> and see me tomorrow.<br> We're ready to do everything<br> we can to help you, Nick.<br> Good-bye.<br> That was the back screen door.<br> The wind blew it shut.<br> Nick, what is it?<br> That's the third time you've jumped up.<br> I can't fall asleep.<br> That's all. Forget it.<br> Ever since Mr. D'Angelo called, you've...<br> Nick, if something's happened,<br> I'll read about it in the papers.<br> - Maybe I can help you.<br> - Stop talking about it<br> and forget it, will ya, honey?<br> You've been listening for something.<br> All night you've been lying there, listening.<br> Yeah, you're right.<br> You'll read about it in the papers.<br> Maybe you can help me.<br> They let Tommy Udo off.<br> - Oh, Nick.<br> - He's loose.<br> - After what you did?<br> - Yeah.<br> - After what you did?<br> - Yeah.<br> That was the wind again.<br> - I can't help it. I'm just jumpy.<br> - The police... We'll call them.<br> The police can't help me.<br> Look, honey, I've gotta go downstairs.<br> - He won't come tonight, Nick.<br> - Maybe he won't.<br> Look, I gotta talk to you.<br> No use hiding it.<br> He's gonna come sometime.<br> - You can go away.<br> - Rizzo went away.<br> Remember what happened to Rizzo's ma?<br> Was that Tommy Udo that did that?<br> Yeah.<br> - We can all go away together, Nick.<br> - No.<br> - Some other town.<br> - No. Too many mugs know me.<br> They're all over.<br> All the guys I met in jail. All the "heisters"<br> I've known ever since I was a kid.<br> They don't stay in one place.<br> They're in every town that you can figure...<br> coming and going.<br> I'm the guy they don't like anymore.<br> The minute they saw me,<br> they'd go straight to Udo.<br> Wherever we went...<br> we'd be just sitting like this...<br> waiting... waiting for him.<br> That's no fun.<br> We've got to get the police to help us,<br> Nick. They'd be glad to.<br> Sure. They'd be glad to. Where am I...<br> What about you and the kids<br> while I'm at work?<br> Do you think I could<br> work while I remember...<br> how Udo would plan to take care of you<br> and the kids?<br> You got a tough break<br> marrying a guy like me.<br> No.<br> Shh. Shh. You'll waken the kids.<br> It won't happen.<br> We won't let it happen.<br> Take it easy. It won't happen...<br> if you'll help me.<br> Anything. Anything.<br> - Start packing.<br> - Now?<br> It's all right.<br> That's Bill Johnson coming home.<br> - Start packing.<br> - Now?<br> Now.<br> - Will you write to me?<br> - Yeah.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Say, buddy, do you happen to know<br> when the Number 12 gets in?<br> No. Sorry. I don't know.<br> Thanks.<br> - Daddy! Daddy!<br> - Be careful. Be careful.<br> Come here.<br> - Now, remember: No letters until I call you.<br> - You'll call?<br> - By Friday. Take care of the kids.<br> - Yes.<br> - And yourself.<br> - Oh, Nick, nothing's going to happen.<br> Now, don't start worrying.<br> Look. You all are going on a vacation.<br> I want 'em to have a good time.<br> I know I...<br> - I know you'll always<br> give 'em a good time, Nettie.<br> - I will.<br> Daddy, do we go on now?<br> - Can we go right on?<br> - Yeah. But first you gotta say good-bye.<br> - Good-bye, Daddy.<br> - Good-bye, Daddy.<br> - I want you to be good,<br> do you hear? And have fun?<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> And always remember to mind Nettie.<br> She's your ma, and do what she says.<br> - We'll miss the train!<br> - Up you go!<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Up!<br> Good-bye.<br> All aboard!<br> Nick!<br> Wait for me in the car.<br> You'd better give me that.<br> - Why didn't you come in today<br> like I told you?<br> - I had things to do.<br> - Sent your family to the country.<br> - Oh.<br> So that was one of your guys<br> at the station.<br> - Well, when you didn't show up,<br> I started worrying about you.<br> - I'll do my own worrying.<br> Nick, our man lost Udo<br> about an hour ago.<br> I came as soon as I heard.<br> Sorry, but I've gotta take you in.<br> - Take me in? For what?<br> - For protection.<br> I'll protect myself.<br> It's him or me now.<br> Nick, I can't connive<br> with murder, yours or his.<br> Look, if it's me that gets him,<br> it won't be murder; it'll be self-defense.<br> You're wrong. We haven't got<br> a thing on Udo. He's acquitted.<br> If you kill him, murder is what any jury'll<br> call it. Use your head and you'll be safe.<br> Yeah, but my wife<br> and kids won't be safe.<br> - What makes you think he'd go after them?<br> - Rizzo's mother.<br> Oh. Well, we'll take care<br> of your family too.<br> You mean, you'll lock us up<br> for the rest of our lives?<br> No. Only until<br> Udo makes his next mistake.<br> - Till he knocks somebody else off.<br> - Till he does anything.<br> Nick, he's a three-time loser now.<br> All we've got to do is catch him with a gun<br> on him, and we can send him up for life.<br> And suppose he don't make a mistake?<br> He didn't the last time.<br> You made the mistake. You had<br> a perfect case, and he beat you on it.<br> You couldn't even keep a tail on him.<br> He's nuts, and he's smarter than you are.<br> Well, sooner or later, he'll trip himself up.<br> They all do. Trust me, Nick.<br> I'm through trusting you, the police<br> or anybody but me.<br> There's only one way to get Udo,<br> and that's my way.<br> Even if you were right,<br> I couldn't take the responsibility.<br> I'm sorry, Nick.<br> You're under arrest.<br> On what charge?<br> You've gotta have a charge.<br> Violation of parole is enough.<br> Well, I... guess that's that.<br> That's better. It won't appear<br> on your record.<br> You came to us for protection.<br> I don't think we have<br> any tables tonight, Mr. Bianco.<br> - I'm not looking for a table.<br> Is Tommy Udo here?<br> - No.<br> Thanks. I'll see ya again.<br> I wouldn't come back if I was you.<br> - Remember me?<br> - Yes.<br> - I got a date here with Tommy Udo.<br> - Udo isn't here.<br> - That's okay. I'll come in and wait for him.<br> - Udo isn't here.<br> How do you do, Mr. Udo?<br> Hello. How are you?<br> - Hello?<br> - Mr. D'Angelo.<br> Nick, where are ya?<br> We got a general alarm out for ya.<br> Never mind that.<br> I found Tommy Udo.<br> - Yeah? Where is he?<br> - I told you we were gonna<br> play this my way.<br> Now, you listen to me. Udo's my job.<br> You keep out of this.<br> Take it easy, Mr. D'Angelo. The only reason<br> I'm calling is that I may need some help.<br> Now, get this: I want you to come to<br> the 37th Precinct Police Station.<br> Bring some men with you from Homicide.<br> If my plan doesn't work,<br> I'll be calling you there.<br> - How long will it take you to get uptown?<br> - About 20 minutes, but, Nick...<br> I'll give you a half hour.<br> When you get to the police station...<br> sit tight and wait for my call.<br> - Hello.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> You are too late to eat, mister.<br> We close at 12:00.<br> - I'm looking for Tommy Udo.<br> - He's not here.<br> Tell him Nick Bianco wants to see him.<br> You wait. I'll see if anyone<br> knows where he is.<br> - Hello, Tommy.<br> - Well, the big man. My pal.<br> - They tell me<br> you've been lookin' for me.<br> - I had to talk to you, Tommy.<br> - Go ahead. Talk. I'm listening.<br> - I'd like to talk to you...<br> not these characters.<br> - You crummy stoolie.<br> - Who asked you anything?<br> My pal wants to talk<br> to me. Go on. Beat it.<br> Okay, pal. What's on your mind?<br> - I gotta square myself with you, Tommy.<br> - There's nothin' to square.<br> You're my pal. You're smart too.<br> I didn't know how smart<br> till I saw you in court.<br> You fooled me,<br> and that takes a big man.<br> Yeah. A big man.<br> Okay. Play it straight, Tommy.<br> I squealed on you.<br> You've got a right to be sore.<br> - What are you gonna do about it?<br> - I ain't gonna do nothin'.<br> You did nothin' to me.<br> They acquitted me, didn't they?<br> We're goin' right on<br> bein' pals, you and me.<br> We're gonna have some fun together,<br> lots of fun, just like we used to.<br> You've got a wife and kids, ain't you, pal?<br> Yeah.<br> They're gonna have some fun too.<br> I'm gonna enjoy meetin' your family.<br> - Lay off of 'em, Tommy.<br> - Why? Huh?<br> Kids like to have fun.<br> We'll all have some fun together:<br> You and me and your wife...<br> and your kids.<br> - From now on, lots of fun.<br> - I'm telling you, lay off of 'em.<br> Is that all you've got to say to me?<br> Okay.<br> I thought you'd listen to reason,<br> but if it's trouble you're looking for...<br> you're gonna get it.<br> Leave me and my family alone,<br> or maybe I ain't through singing.<br> What of it, pal? I'm clean.<br> They can't try me twice on the same rap.<br> No. Not on the Larry Young job.<br> Maybe I know some other tunes.<br> When we were together,<br> you told me a lot of things.<br> You got your eyes full of smoke,<br> and you talk plenty...<br> just like the squirt that you are.<br> You talked your fool head off,<br> and I ain't forgetting any of it.<br> You gave me enough to burn you 100 times over<br> if I can get the other witnesses to back me.<br> And you even gave me a pretty good idea<br> where to look for those other witnesses.<br> You ain't carrying anything<br> in your pocket, Tommy.<br> You're dumb, but you're not that dumb.<br> You'd get life<br> if they found a gun on ya.<br> Now, remember this:<br> Touch my family, and you will hear singing<br> like you never heard before.<br> Go on. Beat it. Peddle your papers.<br> Go on! Blow!<br> - Luigi?<br> - Yes? Yes, Mr. Udo?<br> This is my pal Mr. Bianco.<br> He's a big man, the biggest man in town.<br> I want to show him what I think of him.<br> I want you to give him your deluxe shore dinner.<br> But Mr. Udo, the kitchen is closed.<br> - Then open it, you squirt!<br> - Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Udo.<br> Nothing's too good for my pal.<br> The deluxe shore dinner<br> and a bottle of that good wine. Got it?<br> Yes. Yes, Mr. Udo. Right away.<br> Enjoy yourself, big man.<br> Enjoy your dinner. Everything's on me.<br> Mr. D'Angelo<br> from the D.A.'s office, please.<br> Hello? Nick?<br> Trace this call, will ya?<br> Listen. I just talked with Tommy Udo.<br> I tried to scare him off. It didn't work.<br> There's only one thing for me to do now.<br> I'm gonna hand him to ya on a silver platter.<br> I'm gonna give him to ya the way<br> you want him... with a gun in his hand.<br> Nick, for the love of heaven, where are you?<br> We'll come and get you.<br> I'm setting him up for you, Mr. D'Angelo.<br> He's waiting for me outside this place<br> in a black sedan.<br> I've needled him to the point<br> where he's gotta get me.<br> It'll take you two minutes to get here.<br> In exactly two minutes,<br> I'm going through that door.<br> - Nick, wait a minute.<br> - He'll shoot to kill.<br> Maybe he does; maybe he doesn't.<br> Come in from both ends of the street.<br> Don't come with your sirens,<br> or he'll throw his gun away.<br> Now, get it.<br> The name of the place is Luigi's...<br> on 125th Street,<br> just around the corner from where you are.<br> - You know a place called Luigi's?<br> - Yes, sir. I know it.<br> - Luigi's. Okay.<br> - Now, come on.<br> You've got exactly two minutes.<br> Don't miss.<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you want your dinner?<br> Eat it yourself.<br> Here. Keep this as a souvenir.<br> And in case anybody asks you,<br> remember I gave it to you.<br> What's the matter, big man? You turned<br> yellow? You used to do your own shooting.<br> Give me that gun.<br> You squirt!<br> Get an ambulance.<br> Nick?<br> - Did you get him?<br> - And alive.<br> Thanks, Nick.<br> Sometimes out of<br> the worst comes the best.<br> Mr. D'Angelo got what he wanted.<br> Nick got what he wanted.<br> And I got all I ever wanted. I got Nick.<br> SkyFury<br>
