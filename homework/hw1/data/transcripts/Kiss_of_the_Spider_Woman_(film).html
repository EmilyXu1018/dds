Thank you.<br> And look...<br> at all she brought me.<br> I mean "us."<br> Well, really that's all meant<br> for you.<br> No, you have to stop eating<br> that damn prison chow,<br> and you'll feel better<br> in no time.<br> You think so, huh?<br> You're damn right I do.<br> Starting today<br> a new life begins.<br> Oh, and I took a chance...<br> and left the sheets out<br> to dry...<br> and no one walked away<br> with them,<br> so tonight<br> we both have clean sheets.<br> Nice going.<br> Just let me get<br> this started and...<br> ...presto.<br> In a few minutes,<br> you'll be licking your fingers.<br> I expect you to eat all of<br> these chickens, both of them.<br> Well, what about you?<br> I'm not gonna just let you<br> sit around and drool.<br> No, I have to keep an eye<br> on my girlish figure,<br> or at least what's left of it.<br> Not yet.<br> That's for dessert.<br> Mmm.<br> Would you like<br> some more peaches?<br> No, thanks, I'm stuffed.<br> Good food, good cigarette.<br> I don't remember<br> when I felt so good.<br> There's only one thing missing.<br> Christ!<br> And I thought I was supposed<br> to be the one<br> who was the degenerate<br> around here.<br> No, no.<br> I mean a good movie.<br> Oh, of course!<br> Geez, why didn't I<br> think of that?<br> Your Nazi movie.<br> How does it end?<br> I thought you hated it.<br> Yeah, but I'm curious to see<br> how it turns out.<br> Well, let's see...<br> They are dining<br> at the majestic table<br> in Werner's chateau.<br> As Werner begins to notice<br> Leni's cold distance...<br> she, suddenly, impulsively...<br> hurls her wine glass<br> across the room and says...<br> I refuse to love a man<br> who is the butcher<br> of my country!<br> Oh, my love.<br> Come with me,<br> and you will understand.<br> Werner takes her<br> to this government archive<br> filled with photos and documents<br> about famine<br> throughout the world.<br> He shows her how the elite<br> create false shortages<br> to enslave the masses.<br> Leni is deeply moved<br> and begins to see things<br> through Werner's eyes.<br> From that moment on,<br> Leni understood<br> Werner's mission --<br> to liberate humanity<br> from injustice<br> and domination.<br> As they leave<br> the baroque archive,<br> Leni feels the anguish<br> in her heart being transformed<br> back to her previous admiration,<br> but this time...<br> with the depth of a love...<br> reborn.<br> Oh, my love.<br> How could I ever<br> have doubted you?<br> She begs him to forgive her...<br> and promises to help ensnare<br> his enemies.<br> She arranges this secret meeting<br> with the head of the Resistance,<br> by telling him<br> that she will give the map --<br> Remember the map?<br> Only to him.<br> I believe this...<br> is what you want.<br> Yes.<br> Well done.<br> So often, I was tempted to steal<br> it from him myself,<br> but some things are best done<br> by a woman,<br> a woman who betrays the man<br> she loves.<br> And there is something else<br> I have wanted...<br> almost as much as the map.<br> What?<br> You know very well.<br> Hmm?<br> I've prepared a lavish banquet<br> for two.<br> I'm not hungry.<br> I am...<br> for you.<br> Aah!<br> Leni.<br> Werner hears her sing.<br> She sings like never before.<br> She sings of her eternal love<br> for him<br> and begs him not to cry,<br> because her sacrifice was not...<br> in vain.<br> The end.<br> Well, what'd you think?<br> You told it well.<br> Next time, tell one I like.<br> Come off it.<br> The love story was divine.<br> Forget about the rest.<br> It's so perfect.<br> When Leni...<br> What's going on?<br> What is it?<br> That guy is Americo.<br> Who?<br> The man with my passport!<br> God.<br> They don't know he's here.<br> Who doesn't know?<br> Please, Valentin.<br> Maybe I can help.<br> Good morning.<br> Did you sleep well?<br> Turn the other way, will you?<br> Why?<br> Because you'll laugh.<br> At what?<br> Something on any healthy man,<br> that's all.<br> Whoo. A hard-on.<br> Well, that is healthy.<br> Shall I close my eyes, too?<br> Hey, I missed breakfast.<br> Why didn't you wake me?<br> I told the guard<br> not to bring us anything<br> as long as our food holds up.<br> Damn it, Molina.<br> Stop running my life for me!<br> They already took him away.<br> I didn't want to wake you.<br> The water's almost hot<br> if you want some tea.<br> Here.<br> -Have some cake.<br> -You eat it.<br> Oh, come on,<br> let me spoil you a little.<br> Back off, Molina.<br> It's not my fault<br> they killed your friend --<br> Shut up!<br> You damn faggot!<br> Look.<br> Oh! Oh, Luisa.<br> My favorite friend.<br> Look...at all the wonderful<br> things Mama brought me.<br> Here's a special treat!<br> Assorted bonbons.<br> What's the matter?<br> You don't like candy?<br> About the --<br> this morning.<br> Uh, about my temper.<br> I'm really sorry.<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> It -- It wasn't even you<br> I was mad at.<br> I've been thinking<br> maybe I am mad at you.<br> Why?<br> Because you're so kind.<br> I don't --<br> I don't want to feel obligated<br> to treat you the same way.<br> "Unable to take.<br> Unable to give."<br> Every day he opens up<br> more and more with me.<br> Just give me a few more days.<br> I'm sure he'll talk.<br> If he doesn't,<br> he'll be interrogated again.<br> And thoroughly this time.<br> But he's too weak<br> to be tortured.<br> And if he drops dead,<br> we all lose out.<br> I can't take anybody<br> being nice to me<br> without asking<br> anything in return.<br> If I'm very nice to you<br> it's because...<br> I want your friendship and...<br> No -- Yeah.<br> And...<br> Why not say it?<br> Your affection.<br> The same way that I try<br> to be good to my mother,<br> who's never harmed anyone<br> and who accepts me for what I am<br> and loves me.<br> It's...<br> It's like a gift from heaven...<br> and the only thing<br> that keeps me going.<br> The only thing.<br> And you, too,<br> are a very good person.<br> Very selfless and devoted.<br> Risking your life<br> for your ideals, ready to die,<br> even in here,<br> for what you believe in.<br> Am I embarrassing you?<br> No.<br> Well, sir, there might be a way<br> to speed this up.<br> I'm not sure, but I'm...<br> It's just a hunch.<br> Say it straight, Molina.<br> Well, you know<br> how inmates are, sir.<br> When --<br> When a cellmate leaves...<br> they feel all sentimental<br> and helpless.<br> So, um...<br> Well, he's gotten<br> a bit attached to me,<br> so if he thought<br> that I was being released,<br> he's bound to open up and talk,<br> get a few things off his chest.<br> What do you think?<br> So, that's why I respect you<br> and like you...<br> and hope that you feel<br> the same way about me.<br> So I want us always<br> to be friends.<br> Sure.<br> The reason I...<br> wanted to get this<br> in the open is...<br> because I may be leaving,<br> since I just heard<br> from the warden<br> that I may be paroled soon.<br> When?<br> Tell him that you're up<br> for parole,<br> that we are going to move you<br> to another cell in 24 hours.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And this is your last chance,<br> so get going.<br> You've got 24 hours.<br> One thing, sir.<br> You can't catch a fish<br> without bait.<br> I, um, I need more food.<br> This time, sir,<br> I've prepared a list.<br> They'll probably move me<br> to another cell in 24 hours.<br> My lawyer says<br> that's the procedure.<br> I don't want to get my hopes up<br> too high.<br> Do you want an apple?<br> No, thanks.<br> I guess I should be happy<br> for you.<br> I don't know.<br> Yes. All I wanted in life<br> was to get out of here<br> and take care of my mother.<br> Nothing else mattered,<br> but now that my wish might be...<br> Be happy, damn it.<br> I'd give anything to get out.<br> But is it fair?<br> What?<br> That I always end up<br> with nothing?<br> That I don't have anything<br> truly my own in life?<br> You've got your mother.<br> Yes, but listen, though,<br> she's had a life and lived it.<br> She had a husband and a son.<br> But I'm still waiting.<br> At least she's still alive.<br> But so am I.<br> When is my life<br> supposed to begin?<br> When do I strike it lucky<br> and have something for my own?<br> Right now you just got lucky.<br> Take advantage of it.<br> You're getting out.<br> And do what?<br> Hang out with my friends?<br> A bunch of silly old queens<br> like me?<br> Tell a few jokes till I can't<br> stand the sight of them,<br> because they're a bunch<br> of mirrors<br> that send me running<br> for my life.<br> My life of waiting for nothing?<br> Tell a movie.<br> You'll feel better.<br> Once upon a time...<br> in a tropical island far away...<br> ...there lived a strange woman.<br> She wore a long gown<br> of black lam<br> that fit her like a glove.<br> But the poor thing --<br> she was caught<br> in a giant spider web<br> that grew out of her own body.<br> One day...<br> a shipwrecked man<br> drifted onto the beach.<br> She fed him<br> and cared for his wounds.<br> She nourished him with love<br> and brought him back to life.<br> When he awoke...<br> ...he gazed up<br> at the spider woman...<br> and saw...<br> ...a perfect teardrop<br> slide from under her mask.<br> Why is she crying?<br> I don't know.<br> Why do you always need<br> explanations?<br> Valentin, I'm so tired.<br> I'm tired of suffering.<br> You're not the only one<br> they've hurt.<br> You don't know.<br> I hurt so much inside.<br> Where does it hurt you?<br> In my neck and shoulders.<br> Why does the sadness always<br> jam up in the same spot?<br> Please don't touch me.<br> Can't a friend<br> even pat your back?<br> It only makes it worse.<br> Why?<br> 'Cause I've fallen in love<br> with you.<br> I'm sorry, Valentin.<br> I wish it hadn't happened.<br> I understand.<br> Don't be ashamed.<br> Can I touch you?<br> If it doesn't disgust you,<br> I'd like you to.<br> Can I touch your scar?<br> Sure.<br> Oh.<br> Do what you want with me<br> because that's what I want.<br> If it doesn't disgust you.<br> Okay.<br> You are so kind to me.<br> No.<br> You're the one who's kind.<br> Wait, I'm squeezed<br> against the wall.<br> That's better.<br> No, wait,<br> let me lift my legs.<br> You know, when I woke up,<br> I put my hand to my eyebrow...<br> to feel my scar.<br> You don't have one.<br> Like I wasn't me anymore.<br> As if somehow...<br> I was you.<br> Look, let's not talk about this.<br> Let's not talk<br> about anything at all.<br> Just for this morning,<br> I'm asking.<br> Aren't you going to ask me why?<br> Why?<br> Because I'm happy.<br> I'm really happy,<br> and I don't want to spoil it.<br> The nicest thing<br> about feeling happy...<br> is that you think you'll never<br> feel unhappy again.<br> You shit-face motherfuck.<br> Talk!<br> Let me handle this.<br> Look at me, Molina.<br> What's the matter?<br> You're afraid this group<br> will kill you?<br> Is that it?<br> No, sir, I want to help.<br> So what did he say?<br> Nothing.<br> Wouldn't it be worse<br> if I told you something<br> that was not true?<br> I'll have to move you<br> to another cell, Molina.<br> No, sir, please don't do that.<br> As long as I'm with him,<br> there's still a chance<br> that he might talk.<br> You faggot piece of shit!<br> You fell in love<br> with that bastard!<br> Okay, Molina.<br> You can go.<br> Get your things ready.<br> You're leaving today.<br> Here.<br> The minister approved<br> your parole.<br> Oh. God.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> And no more hanky-panky<br> with the little boys.<br> Oh, no, sir.<br> I swear.<br> They --<br> They would never suspect you.<br> I mean, really,<br> there's no risk at all.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I can't do it.<br> I'm --<br> I'm just too afraid.<br> All you have to do<br> is give them a message...<br> from any public phone.<br> No. No names.<br> No phone numbers. Nothing.<br> I'm terrified of the police.<br> Okay.<br> I guess I shouldn't drag you<br> into this.<br> I swear, Valentin.<br> My only desire is to stay here<br> with you.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> Valentin, I've only ever loved<br> two people in my life.<br> My mother and you.<br> I'm gonna miss you, Molina.<br> At least the movies.<br> Yeah.<br> Whenever I go to sleep,<br> I'll probably be thinking<br> of you and your...<br> crazy movies.<br> Whenever I see bonbons,<br> I'll be thinking of you.<br> Valentin, there's something<br> I'd like to ask you<br> that you've never done,<br> although we've done much more.<br> A kiss.<br> Okay, but first promise me<br> something.<br> I told you I can't,<br> and I'm so sorry.<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> Promise me you will never let<br> anybody humiliate you again.<br> That you'll make them<br> respect you.<br> Promise me you'll never let<br> anybody exploit you again.<br> Nobody has the right to do that<br> to anybody.<br> I promise.<br> Thank you.<br> Valentin?<br> What? The kiss?<br> No. The...<br> The phone number.<br> Wait a few days.<br> Dial two times, then hang up.<br> The third time...<br> Molina. Let's go.<br> Wait.<br> Good luck, Molina.<br> Come on.<br> A beer.<br> Subject was granted<br> a special parole<br> by the minister of justice<br> on orders from the Department<br> of Political Surveillance.<br> The department believes<br> he will lead our agents<br> to the cadre<br> of Valentin Arregui.<br> Mama?<br> Whoo-hoo! Luisa!<br> Look who's here.<br> Nice to see you!<br> The return<br> of the leopard woman!<br> Don't pay attention to them.<br> You look great!<br> Doesn't she?<br> Let's watch the show.<br> Oh, shut up,<br> you bunch of faggots!<br> Now I would like to welcome home<br> a very dear friend,<br> a cherished sister,<br> who spent Lord knows<br> how many precious nights<br> to pay a stupid debt<br> to this hypocritical society.<br> This is for you, lovely Luisa.<br> Surveillance reveals<br> subject has not returned to work<br> and almost never leaves home.<br> He spends his evenings<br> staring out the window<br> for no apparent reason.<br> You sure you won't eat<br> something?<br> Just coffee.<br> You want to talk, Molina?<br> Is there something wrong?<br> No, I'm just not going<br> to see you for a while.<br> I'm going away.<br> With another boy?<br> That's good.<br> Don't get arrested again.<br> You're too old for it.<br> I have a message<br> from Valentin Arregui.<br> Yes, a pay phone.<br> Excuse me,<br> is that really necessary?<br> Um, all right.<br> Um...<br> I'll be wearing a red scarf.<br> You don't have to close<br> the account.<br> There's no penalty<br> if you maintain --<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Do you have an envelope, please?<br> Thank you.<br> Now, this...<br> is for Mama.<br> To take care of her<br> while I'm gone.<br> Please.<br> All right, I'll handle it.<br> Wherever you're going,<br> it's probably for the best.<br> Mama, you look so beautiful.<br> Remember, Mama,<br> when I was little<br> and you used to come<br> into my room<br> and kiss me good night.<br> I always pretended<br> to be asleep,<br> but I was always waiting<br> for your kiss.<br> And though you're sleeping now,<br> I know you understand me.<br> It's time for me<br> to take care of my own life.<br> You understand, don't you, Mama?<br> Don't be sad.<br> Go that way.<br> Move, quick.<br> Who are you?<br> I have a message from Valentin.<br> Are you Lydia?<br> Yes. Get in quick.<br> Get him!<br> Molina! Stop!<br> Stop, Molina!<br> Get the car.<br> Move. Hurry!<br> Stand up. Move.<br> Get in the car!<br> The number.<br> Tell me the telephone number,<br> and you go to the hospital.<br> Talk, you fucking fag!<br> The number!<br> Subject was shot to death<br> by the extremists.<br> His recent activities,<br> such as closing<br> his bank account,<br> suggest that he planned<br> to escape with them.<br> Also the way he was shot<br> seems to indicate<br> that he had agreed,<br> if necessary,<br> to be eliminated by them.<br> In any case, it appears that<br> he was more deeply involved<br> than we suspected.<br> This is morphine.<br> So you can get some rest, okay?<br> Oh, my God.<br> The way they worked you over.<br> Okay.<br> Just don't tell anyone<br> about this, or I'll lose my job.<br> Just count to 40<br> and you'll be asleep.<br> Marta...<br> Come, Valentin.<br> Come with me.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> You won't wake up in the cell.<br> What about Molina?<br> Come, my love.<br> Only he knows<br> if he died happy or sad.<br> I love you so much.<br> That's the one thing<br> I never said to you<br> because I was afraid<br> of losing you forever.<br> That can never happen now.<br> This dream is short,<br> but this dream is happy.<br>
