That's why I said yes.<br> What I'm getting around to...<br> ...is that fellow in Philadelphia.<br> Is that all over?<br> All over.<br> You're not kidding yourself, are you?<br> It wouldn't do either of us good<br> if you weren't sure.<br> I'm sure, darling.<br> Look, I've gotta go back<br> to the hospital now.<br> But I'll check out at midnight.<br> Get your bags packed<br> and meet me there...<br> ...and we'll go to Gretna Green.<br> - Gretna Green?<br> - Sure.<br> They've got a justice of peace<br> that's open all night.<br> Just like an Owl Drugstore.<br> Can you be ready by then?<br> And who says I can't?<br> Then meet me<br> at St. Timothy's Hospital at 12.<br> Smack on the dot.<br> - Twelve, smack on the dot, St. Timothy's.<br> - Right.<br> Driver, Pocahontas Hotel for Women,<br> West 34th Street.<br> But what about my dinner?<br> Save it, and we'll have<br> a big breakfast together.<br> - Good evening, Miss Foyle.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Will you make up my bill tonight?<br> - You're leaving?<br> I'll say I am. I'm getting married.<br> - And send for my bags around 11:30.<br> - Very well.<br> Hello.<br> Well, what are you doing out<br> of Philadelphia on a night like this?<br> How did you get in?<br> Men aren't allowed in this hotel,<br> you know.<br> The operator<br> on the back elevator's corrupt.<br> Oh, Wyn, why did you come?<br> You sent for me.<br> I told you if you ever wanted me<br> or needed me, or to have me...<br> ...to send it back.<br> That isn't what I meant.<br> I sent it back because...<br> ...that was all.<br> - That was the end.<br> - Don't say that, Kitty.<br> But it's true, Wyn.<br> I'm sorry, but you'll have to go.<br> I can't go, not until<br> I've told you something.<br> I don't want to hear it, Wyn.<br> Please go.<br> Please don't make me ask you again.<br> I'm sailing at midnight.<br> Where?<br> South America, Buenos Aires.<br> I'm going to live there.<br> With your wife?<br> Alone.<br> Unless you'll go with me.<br> Oh, Wyn.<br> That's what I came to tell you.<br> The thousands of times<br> I've prayed for you to say that...<br> Prayed and prayed and prayed.<br> And you never could.<br> You never did.<br> But I'm saying it now,<br> from the bottom of my heart.<br> Oh, Wyn, why couldn't you have thought<br> to say those same little words...<br> ...five years ago?<br> I thought of them.<br> I just hadn't the strength to say them.<br> Kitty, darling...<br> ...you know me better<br> than I know myself.<br> There's no life for me without you.<br> I want you. I need you.<br> I love you this minute<br> as I've never loved you before.<br> And I thought you'd forgotten.<br> You didn't. You never thought that<br> for a minute.<br> You know too well how I've wanted you.<br> You're going to be divorced?<br> No.<br> I'm afraid I can't<br> even promise you that.<br> Then we'd?<br> That's it.<br> I wish it were different...<br> ...but that's the way it is.<br> I see.<br> Whatever you decide, I'm sailing anyway.<br> I've broken away for good.<br> But I'm hoping, I'm praying now,<br> that we'll go away together...<br> ...and be together always.<br> Of all the days in all the years...<br> You haven't forgotten, have you, Kitty?<br> I thought I had.<br> I was sure I had.<br> The firelight at Lake Pocono,<br> our assembly in New York.<br> - Please, Wyn.<br> - Those times at Giono's, remember?<br> The dreams we dreamed,<br> the sound of our voices as we laughed...<br> I remember.<br> Oh, darling, we must<br> never forget any of it.<br> It isn't too late, is it?<br> I'm afraid it never will be.<br> This is the beginning,<br> the real beginning of life for us.<br> I shouldn't, I shouldn't, it's wrong.<br> Wrong to be happy?<br> Oh, Wyn, don't ask me anything.<br> Don't let me think.<br> Just take me with you.<br> Darling, we sail at midnight.<br> I'll be at the pier with everything arranged.<br> - Meet me there?<br> - You know I will.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Don't be late.<br> - I won't.<br> Wyn, Wyn!<br> You didn't say what boat, what pier.<br> When I'm with you,<br> I forget about everything else.<br> It's Pier 48.<br> I'll be there waiting for you.<br> You're making a mistake, you know.<br> Am I?<br> You're that little girl on the sleigh ride.<br> Trouble is, you're no longer a little girl.<br> You're a grown woman now.<br> I'm only 24.<br> You're 26. Don't try to kid me.<br> Well, I'm not old, anyway.<br> No, and maybe<br> you aren't very smart either.<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> It's a pretty unsatisfactory role<br> you're preparing to play...<br> ...even under the best of circumstances.<br> This is the only chance we have,<br> and we've got to take it.<br> How do you imagine you'll be described?<br> As Wyn's girlfriend?<br> That's the delicate one.<br> And in about 10 years,<br> when your figure gets out of control...<br> ...it'll sound like a comedy line.<br> His woman? That's getting warmer.<br> As "that woman Wyn's mixed up with"?<br> Oh, you have no idea how often<br> you're going to get that one.<br> We'll just have to face it.<br> Correction, you'll have to face it.<br> Married people face things together,<br> but you won't be married.<br> Did you ever think of it that way?<br> No time to think.<br> Well, you'd better take a little time,<br> sister...<br> ...because forever is a long, long time.<br> Never hurts to check<br> with the conductor...<br> ...to see if you're on the right train.<br> Marriage isn't everything.<br> What is it, anyway?<br> It's just a piece of paper<br> like any other legal document.<br> I don't need a piece of paper<br> to prove that I love Wyn...<br> ...or that he loves me.<br> You'd be a lot happier with Mark<br> and that little piece of paper...<br> ...than you ever could with Wyn<br> and a snug little apartment...<br> ...with a key for him<br> and a key for you.<br> You know what I think?<br> I think you're wrong.<br> I remember you using<br> those same words before.<br> Remember?<br> Way back when you lived<br> on Griscom Street in Philadelphia.<br> That's where Pop brought you up,<br> and what a grand guy he was.<br> It was the night of<br> the Philadelphia Assembly, remember?<br> You should have been home,<br> but you weren't.<br> You were about 15 then.<br> That's P. Seward Berwynn.<br> There's Mrs. Rosy Fittenhouse.<br> Judas Priest, what a clock.<br> Always slow.<br> Philadelphia blood, I suppose.<br> Kitty.<br> - I was just...<br> - Come here.<br> - I was just...<br> - Oh, I know what you were just doing.<br> The assembly's tonight,<br> and you were downtown...<br> ...gawking at rich mainliners<br> parading into the Bellevue-Stratford...<br> ...and getting silly ideas.<br> No, I wasn't, Pop.<br> I was watching, yes, but...<br> Kitty, you've got to get this trash<br> out of your mind.<br> From now on...<br> From now on, you're going<br> to Sunday school every Sunday.<br> Rain or shine, you're going.<br> But why, Pop?<br> Well, it'll give you<br> a little Christian upbringing, that's why.<br> Give you a sense of values.<br> You mean, and then<br> I won't ever sin or anything?<br> Well, it may not keep you from sinning...<br> ...but by Judas Priest, it'II keep you<br> from getting any fun out of it.<br> Take your mind off of that tommyrot<br> in the society page for a change.<br> It's not any more tommyrot<br> than "The Lady of Shalott."<br> - "Lady of Shalot''?<br> - You know:<br> And sometimes thro' the mirror blue<br> The knights went riding two by two:<br> She hath no loyal knight and true,<br> The Lady of Shalott.<br> Papdash, Kitty.<br> If you're not reading about<br> mainline monkeys...<br> ...you've got your head stuck<br> in a Cinderella book.<br> It must be wonderful, Pop.<br> You've been sitting in ashes all your life,<br> and then suddenly a prince comes along.<br> And when did you sit in any ashes?<br> I don't mean me.<br> I mean like Cinderella.<br> Judas Priest, if ever a man<br> deserved to be hung...<br> ...it's the fellow who started<br> that Cinderella stuff.<br> Writing claptrap stories<br> about Cinderellas and princes.<br> Poisoning the minds<br> of innocent children.<br> Putting crazy ideas into girls' heads.<br> Making them dissatisfied<br> with honest shoe clerks and bookkeepers.<br> Why, they're the ruination<br> of more girls than 40 actors.<br> Oh, I don't see<br> what's the ruination about it.<br> After all, the prince and Cinderella<br> lived happily ever afterwards.<br> Yes, and that's where<br> these writing fellows are smart too.<br> They always end the story<br> before it really begins.<br> Well, why couldn't they be happy, Pop?<br> Why, it's a lead-pipe cinch<br> that they couldn't.<br> What do you think<br> they'd have to talk about?<br> You think he wants to go on hearing<br> about the ashes she was sitting in...<br> ...and how hot they were?<br> "Okay," he says,<br> "So they were hot.<br> Let's talk about something else<br> for a change."<br> And there she'd be, alone...<br> ...sitting on that velvet cushion...<br> ...ready to swap all the strawberries<br> and cream in the kingdom...<br> ...for one hamburger,<br> well done, with onions.<br> You know what I think, Pop?<br> I think you're wrong.<br> Judas Priest!<br> But time moved on...<br> ...and skirts got six inches longer...<br> ...and they stopped playing "Sonny Boy,"<br> thank goodness...<br> ...and took up "Who's Afraid<br> of the Big Bad Wolf."<br> Then, boom, came the Depression...<br> ...and you had to trade in<br> a few of those dreams...<br> ...for a volume of Gregg Shorthand,<br> remember?<br> June 1932.<br> Mr. Hoover said<br> if Mr. Roosevelt was elected...<br> ...grass would grow in the streets.<br> Mr. Roosevelt said<br> that if Mr. Hoover got back in...<br> ...there wouldn't be any streets.<br> All of a sudden, you were set.<br> Oh, boy.<br> All you needed<br> to get a peach of a job...<br> ...was this fancy document...<br> ...and a miracle.<br> Then, on July 23rd...<br> ...at exactly 4:37 p. M...<br> ...will you ever forget?<br> Judas Priest! Put it out, put it out!<br> - Don't get excited, Tom, I'll take care of it.<br> - Do something!<br> Get some water, get some water!<br> Isn't there any water in the house?<br> Somebody get a bucket of water!<br> No, not that, not that!<br> - Drop that bottle!<br> - Pop, don't get excited. Sit down.<br> With all the water<br> there is in the world...<br> ...you have to use<br> a $4 bottle of whiskey.<br> There's more where that came from,<br> Tony's bathtub.<br> That's no bathtub whiskey.<br> He's been sick.<br> He shouldn't be upset.<br> - The stuff doesn't grow on trees, you know.<br> - Come on now.<br> - Why couldn't you have done that?<br> - I thought it would explode.<br> - What, are you trying to ruin the rug?<br> - Just trying to put the fire out. I'm sorry.<br> - My fault, I dropped some ashes.<br> - Wyn, that's my daughter.<br> Kitty, this is Mr. Wyn Strafford...<br> ...one of those mainliners<br> you used to talk about.<br> - How do you do, Miss Foyle?<br> - How do you do?<br> I'm sorry I spoke a little sharply<br> to you just now.<br> I'm usually a little cooler-headed.<br> Yes, I'm sure so.<br> He wants me to help with articles<br> for his new magazine...<br> ...about the boys I taught cricket.<br> What are you doing in here<br> in your shirttail?<br> - Judas Priest!<br> - Get out of here, get out of here.<br> She's too big<br> to be running around like that.<br> A nice girl, Tom.<br> She's a good kid, all right.<br> If it weren't for my bad heart,<br> she'd be going to college...<br> ...instead of tramping the streets<br> for a job.<br> Does she type?<br> She types faster than you can think.<br> Well, I don't know that<br> that's much of a tribute.<br> But if she can type at all, we might<br> be able to use her down at the office.<br> Ask her to drop in.<br> There seems to be a certain<br> informality about her...<br> ...that might brighten our lives<br> down there.<br> This is not right, Miss Foyle.<br> The use of "esquire" in business<br> is a New York affectation.<br> Very bad taste.<br> Well, I've seen letters addressed to you<br> "Mr. Wynnewood Strafford VI, Esq."<br> New Yorkers, perhaps. It's still wrong.<br> A man can't be both "Mr." and "Esq."<br> At the same time.<br> One or the other is about<br> all he's capable of being.<br> Well, I've certainly seen them<br> just plain "Esq."<br> Say, how does one get to be an esquire,<br> anyway?<br> Oh, I don't know. He just is.<br> Pop says you get to be<br> an esquire...<br> ...if you can sit on one animal<br> and chase another.<br> Did I sound stuffy?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Pardon?<br> Okay, get stuffy yourself.<br> I've said I'm sorry.<br> Did you get my column<br> off the Dictaphone?<br> Oh, yes, and it's a...<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> Go ahead, what about it?<br> Don't be afraid.<br> I was just thinking...<br> ...how your voice sounds<br> on the Dictaphone.<br> Do you know who it sounds like?<br> - No, who?<br> - Ronald Coleman.<br> Really?<br> - I played it over again, and it's lovely.<br> - That's funny.<br> So different from what it is actually.<br> Do you really think it's true,<br> Miss Foyle...<br> ...that my voice sounds<br> rather like that of Mr. Coleman?<br> - Hello, everybody.<br> - Hello, Jean.<br> - Who's winning?<br> - Just started.<br> Oh, Miss Bala,<br> did you bring in your copy?<br> Copy? Copy of what?<br> Your article on the Wheeler wedding.<br> We're ready to go to press.<br> Oh, that. You know,<br> I never got to the wedding.<br> I got mixed up<br> at a cocktail party...<br> ...and then went on<br> to Bellevue-Stratford...<br> ...and that was a simply<br> crashing bore, really.<br> Miss Foyle, why don't you make Wyn<br> throw some kind of party here?<br> A sort of housewarming,<br> something like that?<br> Sounds like a crashing good idea.<br> I would just like to say that I'm sorry.<br> I was fresh just now.<br> I didn't notice it.<br> Well, I was, and I'm sorry.<br> Judas Priest. Why don't you kick those<br> snake-brained friends of yours out...<br> ...and give yourself a chance?<br> They're pretty aggravating, I know...<br> ...but they do the stuff<br> we've got to have.<br> Yeah, well, it's none of my business,<br> I know...<br> ...but, well, I'd just like you to know<br> that I'm in your corner, that's all.<br> Thank you, Miss Foyle.<br> It's encouraging to find someone here<br> who's taking this thing seriously.<br> Would you like me<br> to run that record off for you?<br> Oh, no. I was just fiddling with it...<br> ...figuring how it worked.<br> - Oh, it's simple.<br> Really, don't you think<br> you'd better pop out to lunch?<br> - Miss Foyle, there's no need...<br> - See, you push that...<br> Do you really think it's true,<br> Miss Foyle...<br> ...that my voice sounds<br> rather like that of Mr. Coleman?<br> Ah, Shangri-la, Miss Foyle.<br> Foyle, Foyle, boil in oil.<br> Roses are red, violets are blue...<br> ...Miss Foyle has nice legs, I love you.<br> - Is that all?<br> - And I'll thank you, Miss Foyle...<br> ...not to sit with your legs crossed<br> during conferences.<br> We have difficulties enough<br> getting this magazine out...<br> ...without such<br> demoralizing exhibitions.<br> I think I'd better go to lunch after all.<br> - Wait a minute, let me explain.<br> - Wyn, Wyn, boil in gin.<br> I'm terribly sorry, really.<br> I didn't intend... I mean...<br> Well, I was testing, like on the radio.<br> I never thought of what I was saying.<br> - Do you mind letting me out, please?<br> - No.<br> Not until I've made you understand.<br> Well, it was like...<br> Like automatic writing.<br> People go into trances,<br> don't know what they're saying.<br> It just comes out.<br> Whole books sometimes.<br> - That's the way it was.<br> - It's very amusing.<br> I think I'll go to lunch.<br> Miss Foyle...<br> ...I want you to take<br> some dictation before you go.<br> Let's see.<br> Interoffice memo to Miss Foyle.<br> I'm sorry I said you cross your legs<br> in conferences...<br> ...but you do.<br> I'm sorry I said they demoralize me...<br> ...but they do.<br> I'm sorry you seem to think that I...<br> I'm making love to you.<br> But...<br> ...I am.<br> There's no getting around it.<br> Those were probably the happiest days<br> in your whole life.<br> Days when you and Wyn were still learning<br> those little things about each other...<br> ...that make two ordinarily normal people<br> a little daffy when they're together.<br> Crazy, but nice.<br> Like the first time he took you<br> to New York, remember?<br> Thanks, mister.<br> - Violets? Violets?<br> - Yes.<br> Two bunches, please.<br> Thank you.<br> I've never been<br> in a speakeasy before.<br> Don't have a moment's concern.<br> The best people in New York come here.<br> On a Saturday night<br> it's hard not to find...<br> - Who is it?<br> - Giono.<br> Mr. Strafford.<br> - Come in, come in.<br> - Giono, how are you?<br> Mr. Strafford, it is nice to see you.<br> I haven't seen you since a long time.<br> Latest returns from New York State:<br> ...out of a total of 9046...<br> ...give Hoover 936,421...<br> ...Roosevelt 1,412,604.<br> It looks bad now,<br> but Roosevelt will never make it.<br> Didn't you vote for him, Giono?<br> Me vote for Roosevelt? He's a wet.<br> He wants to repeal prohibition.<br> Prohibition goes, where am I?<br> How about some nice smooth Scotch?<br> Fresh off the boat today.<br> You mean some of that bilge water<br> you whipped up this afternoon?<br> This is a pleasure trip,<br> not a suicide pact.<br> How about some Strega?<br> I just got one bottle.<br> I save it just for you.<br> How nice of you, you liar.<br> Let's have it.<br> And one glass of water.<br> What's Strega?<br> Oh, it's an Italian liqueur.<br> It has a picture of a witch<br> on the bottle.<br> They say that if two people<br> drink it together...<br> ...they'll never drink it apart.<br> - And now for an election flash.<br> - How cozy.<br> - Republican headquarters...<br> ...have just conceded<br> the state of Pennsylvania...<br> ...to Roosevelt.<br> He'll never make it.<br> Wait until the returns come in from<br> the Middle West. They'll kill him.<br> Hoover was born there, you know.<br> Giono, from now on, this is our bottle.<br> Nobody else touches it, understand?<br> Fine. I won't even touch it myself.<br> We'll fix that.<br> There.<br> Why so solemn?<br> Oh, I was just wondering.<br> What about?<br> Why did you bring me here to New York?<br> I thought you'd like it. Why?<br> Because, well, you see...<br> ...when I was going to<br> high school in Manitou, Illinois...<br> ...it's quite a small town and everybody<br> knew everybody else's business.<br> So when a man wanted<br> to take somebody out...<br> ...and he didn't care particularly<br> about being seen with her...<br> ...he'd always take her up to Chicago.<br> I see.<br> But this isn't like that.<br> In fact, it's exactly the opposite.<br> I wanted to make a good impression<br> on you...<br> ...so I brought you where I thought<br> I most likely could do it.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry if...<br> - Kitty.<br> - Election flash.<br> - I've got an idea.<br> Republican headquarters have conceded<br> Kansas and Nebraska to Roosevelt.<br> Doesn't mean a thing.<br> Wait until the Pacific Coast<br> returns come in.<br> That's really where Hoover is going<br> to murder him. He lives there.<br> Thanks.<br> Kitty, will you go to the assembly<br> with me this year?<br> Will you?<br> Wyn, that's awfully nice...<br> ...but you don't have to do that.<br> But I want you to go.<br> It isn't merely a gesture.<br> It's funny.<br> When I was a little girl, I used to read in<br> the newspapers about the assembly...<br> ...and cut out the pictures<br> of the society ladies...<br> ...in their beautiful dresses,<br> and use them as paper dolls.<br> That's probably the best use<br> they've ever been put to.<br> But isn't there a committee that goes over<br> the list of who's to be invited?<br> Well, if they should run across<br> somebody like a Foyle, boom.<br> And the next thing she knows,<br> she's being scraped up off the sidewalk.<br> You just leave that to me.<br> Is it a date?<br> Well, I know I'm crazy,<br> but it's a date.<br> Attention, everybody.<br> Republican National Headquarters<br> have just conceded...<br> ...that the next president<br> of the United States...<br> ...will be Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br> Happy days are here again.<br> Hooray!<br> Hooray, hooray!<br> What are you celebrating about?<br> Hoover didn't win.<br> I'm celebrating our first kiss.<br> Hooray, hooray!<br> You're crazy.<br> Sing, fellow. If you don't sing,<br> you ain't 100 percent American.<br> Thanks, pal.<br> We're 100 percent Americans, ain't we?<br> - Sure. Hooray for America.<br> - Hooray for Kitty.<br> Kitty for president. Hooray.<br> - Hey, what are you doing?<br> - It isn't private enough.<br> Roosevelt's horning in on my celebration.<br> Let's go to Lake Pocono to see the sunset.<br> - But it's too late. It's already set.<br> - All right, we'll go see the moon rise.<br> But Lancelot mused a little space:<br> He said,'She has a lovely face:<br> God in His mercy lend her grace,<br> The Lady of Shalott.'<br> I thought you said this was your<br> favorite poem.<br> What tune is this?<br> "Night and Day."<br> All right, you play one.<br> "Stormy Weather."<br> - No?<br> - No, no.<br> - Well, play it again, play it again.<br> - All right.<br> - "Three Little Words."<br> - Yes.<br> The stag at eve had drunk his fill<br> Where danced the moon on Monan's Rill<br> He brushed his teeth<br> And he combed his hair<br> And he took a whiff of the mountain air.<br> Now you've destroyed a beautiful poem.<br> You have no sense of the importance<br> of beauty in life.<br> Well, why don't you tell me of<br> the importance of beauty in life, teacher?<br> Glad to.<br> As you know, it's a man's duty<br> to instruct woman in all subjects.<br> Now, you pick the subject.<br> Well, tell me where we are.<br> We're in the Pocono Mountains,<br> in the state of Pennsylvania.<br> But where are we really?<br> In heaven?<br> No, in love.<br> Tell me about love.<br> Well, first there was a man...<br> ...and just as soon as he had time to<br> learn his way about, there was a woman.<br> Was the woman beautiful?<br> Very. She had reddish hair...<br> ...and her nose that went like so...<br> ...and her eyes, her eyes were<br> as blue-green as the sea itself.<br> She looked something like me, huh?<br> Well, her voice didn't sound<br> so much like music...<br> ...and her eyes didn't trap the starlight<br> one half as cleverly...<br> ...and she wasn't nearly so beautiful.<br> What did the man and the woman do?<br> Oh, at first, they just hung around.<br> Didn't take any notice<br> of each other at all.<br> Oh, maybe a grunt now and then,<br> but certainly nothing more.<br> They thought of each other as company,<br> or perhaps as friends.<br> And then, one night,<br> a strange thing happened.<br> What?<br> The man and woman were sitting<br> in front of a fire.<br> Firelight played upon the woman's face...<br> ...and the man for the first time saw<br> how beautiful she was...<br> ...so immediately he made love to her.<br> How?<br> He bent down over her,<br> rubbed her nose with his.<br> - Didn't the woman object?<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> - She loved him too.<br> Why?<br> - Well...<br> - Because...<br> ...he was all that she had<br> ever dreamed of.<br> Tell me some more about<br> the man and the woman.<br> Let me see, where was I?<br> You were here.<br> Judas Priest.<br> Pop, what are you doing downstairs?<br> Didn't Dr. Cartwright tell you<br> to stay in bed?<br> Dr. Cartwright is a quack.<br> Sure, sure, and who said he wasn't?<br> Now, come on.<br> You're going to stay down,<br> you understand?<br> There now.<br> How does the rebel feel this morning?<br> I have an idea that I'm a little below par.<br> You were born four drinks below par.<br> Think you could force<br> a little of this down?<br> I know how you hate it,<br> and I don't blame you.<br> But I guess you'll just have to steel<br> yourself to take it. Do you promise?<br> I only take it to tone up my system,<br> and you know it.<br> Just so you don't tone it up so high...<br> ...that you'll be out in the street<br> in your rompers.<br> - That you, Myrtle?<br> - Yes, Miss Kitty, this is me.<br> - I just got here.<br> - All right.<br> I'm going out to dinner, Pop,<br> so Myrtle's gonna get you yours.<br> - Goodbye, darling.<br> - Kitty, come here a moment, honey.<br> You remember when I gave you<br> this thing?<br> Well, I think you must have<br> got me wrong.<br> I didn't mean that you were<br> to be a little girl on a sleigh ride.<br> Go on, Pop,<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> I mean Wyn Strafford.<br> Pop, you might as well try to argue me<br> out of a case of bronchitis...<br> ...because I love him.<br> Judas Priest.<br> You said it.<br> You mean you want to marry him?<br> Has he ever asked you<br> to meet his family?<br> Well, I've never worried much<br> about his family...<br> ...because I've always had a funny idea<br> that I'm just as good as they are.<br> Just as good?<br> So far above them, they can't<br> touch you with a 10-foot pole.<br> You've got good Irish eyes, Kitty,<br> and they're looking into the future.<br> The Main Line? They haven't even<br> caught up with the present.<br> Your grandpa was a mainliner,<br> you know.<br> - Grandpa Foyle?<br> - Yes. He helped lay the tracks.<br> That was real mainlining, because<br> those tracks were going somewhere.<br> Oh, Kitty, why can't you fall in love<br> with a man that's going somewhere?<br> Pop, there's no use of<br> our arguing about it.<br> For one thing, I don't agree with you.<br> And for another, he hasn't asked me.<br> Yet.<br> And he never will.<br> But he loves me, Pop, I know it.<br> That's fine for him, but where does<br> it get you? Exactly nowhere.<br> I know the whole lot of them.<br> I taught them cricket at school,<br> watched them being educated.<br> They may want to break away bad enough,<br> but they never do, Kitty.<br> They always finish up by marrying<br> one of their own kind.<br> I was a fool ever to let him inside<br> this house.<br> You darling. I've got to go to work.<br> But I'll let you in on a little secret.<br> A woman always can tell<br> when a man is going to propose.<br> You mean woman's instinct?<br> Now, there's a real piece of idiocy.<br> Woman's instinct.<br> Every slab-sided female in the world<br> is a crystal gazer.<br> She's magic. She can foretell<br> the future, like a politician.<br> Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.<br> I've got to go work. Goodbye, darling.<br> And don't you worry about me, Pop...<br> ...because I can take care of myself<br> all right.<br> Goodbye, dear.<br> Take care of yourself? By Judas Priest,<br> you're going to break your heart.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Morning, Miss Foyle.<br> - Morning.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Someone steal the backgammon board?<br> Wyn wants to see you.<br> Oh, is he in already?<br> Morning, darling.<br> - May I come in?<br> - No, I'm coming out.<br> Good morning.<br> Hey, what's all that?<br> Have you ever heard of the Depression?<br> Yes, isn't it disgusting?<br> It always comes around when<br> everybody's so broke.<br> Well, it's right here.<br> Right here in this office.<br> What do you mean?<br> Our little magazine is folding Saturday.<br> Oh, Wyn.<br> Your boss is a flop.<br> Don't say that, darling,<br> because it's not so.<br> Well, here, sit down<br> and tell me about it.<br> - Well, there's not much to tell.<br> - Well, what happened?<br> I got the idea for this magazine...<br> ...because I didn't like following<br> the family in a groove.<br> I still don't. I thought this might be<br> the answer, if I could swing it.<br> Yes, but they say all magazines<br> lose money at first.<br> That's great,<br> when they've got it to lose.<br> I haven't. The 10,000<br> the family gave me is gone.<br> Uncle Kennet's persuaded them<br> not to pour any more in.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I don't like this flop stuff from you.<br> You're a nice big boy with the right<br> number of arms and hands and legs...<br> ...and plenty of brains.<br> If you think I'm going to break into tears<br> over your first setback, you're mistaken.<br> Well, you still got your health,<br> haven't you?<br> But, darling, don't you see?<br> I tried to break away,<br> and it didn't work.<br> I'm washed up.<br> So you're washed up?<br> I suppose you're the only guy in the United<br> States who has got washed up this year?<br> What are you gonna do, get together with<br> some brokers and leap out a window?<br> No.<br> I guess I'll have to go on<br> back to the bank.<br> Oh, they can't make a banker out of you.<br> You're too sweet.<br> And besides, Wyn Strafford,<br> if you talk like that again...<br> ...I give you my word,<br> I'll pop you right in the nose.<br> You can't do that. You're different.<br> You're going somewhere.<br> Yeah, like the real mainliners.<br> Do you really believe that, Kitty?<br> Well, I told you once<br> I was in your corner, didn't I?<br> Well, I still am.<br> One round you've lost,<br> but there are 14 others coming up.<br> Darling, what about you?<br> Me?<br> Yes, what are you going to do?<br> Oh, that's right, I'm out of a job.<br> I never thought about that.<br> Well, I might get a job in New York.<br> Friend of mine lives there.<br> Kitty, I can't let you do that.<br> Why not?<br> Because you'd be too far away.<br> Well, it's not China.<br> Kitty...<br> You're all alone.<br> Your dad isn't very well.<br> I think it's too much of a load<br> for you to handle.<br> Somehow I feel kind of responsible.<br> It isn't your fault the magazine folded,<br> you know.<br> So until you can get another job...<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I'll just keep you on the payroll.<br> - It's no more than fair, Kitty, I...<br> - Just a minute, Wyn.<br> You needn't worry about me.<br> I'm free, white and 21.<br> Or almost.<br> And I'll go on loving you<br> from here on out...<br> ...or until I stop loving you.<br> But nobody owes a thing<br> to Kitty Foyle...<br> ...except Kitty Foyle.<br> You were right, Pop.<br> Well, it was just like you said.<br> Pop. Pop? Pop!<br> Oh, Pop, Pop, Pop.<br> Oh, no, Pop.<br> So it was goodbye to Pop<br> and Philadelphia...<br> ...and all of that part of your life.<br> You ran away to New York.<br> And why New York?<br> All right, kid, let's face it.<br> It was because New York<br> reminded you of Wyn.<br> Oh, you may have shut the door<br> on brother Wyn...<br> ...but, honey, you certainly<br> had no intention of locking it.<br> What you really hoped was<br> that Wyn would come and find you.<br> So you joined the New York<br> white-collar brigade and waited.<br> But, of course, such a perfume<br> should never be applied directly.<br> It should evanesce.<br> So.<br> How do you think a string quartet<br> would go with that?<br> I wish you'd do as well<br> with the cuticle department.<br> Volupte is rather competitive.<br> Its base, of course, is allure.<br> You will notice. May I?<br> There is a slightly aloof, slightly<br> supercilious quality to the bouquet.<br> But you'll notice just the merest shade<br> of promise there too.<br> That's right.<br> It is the favorite of<br> la femme chic du Paris.<br> - Really?<br> - Are you married?<br> Yes.<br> It's still a charming perfume,<br> even around the house.<br> I think I'll take it.<br> Oh, I'm so glad. I'm sure it will make you<br> very happy, and monsieur too.<br> It is...<br> ...sixty-seven dollars an ounce.<br> How many ounces?<br> Isn't that? Isn't that rather expensive?<br> How else could we keep the wrong sort<br> of person from wearing it?<br> - One ounce will do.<br> - Merci, madame.<br> Boy, this Detaille really hauls off<br> and charges, doesn't she?<br> Sixty-seven bucks an ounce.<br> Take a look at these customers.<br> Don't you think they at least want<br> to smell good?<br> - Where do I find a box to fit this?<br> - We're out.<br> You better ring stock for one.<br> - Oh, I must have done something wrong.<br> - You said it, sister.<br> What'II I do?<br> If you don't wanna lose your job, flop.<br> Faint.<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, my blood pressure.<br> Somebody get a doctor.<br> Operator? Operator, operator,<br> get a doctor, quickly.<br> Yes, yes, get an ambulance.<br> - Let me out of this place.<br> - Where's the patient?<br> I'll be the patient<br> if you don't let me out of here.<br> I'm gonna have my husband write<br> to your police captain.<br> Well, this looks bad. Probably a fracture.<br> Seems all right.<br> Everything's okay from the knees down.<br> - Probably a hip dislocation.<br> - Lay off.<br> Oh, faking?<br> Yes. Now will you be a good guy<br> and go away?<br> I've got just the thing here<br> for what ails you.<br> Listen, there's nothing wrong with me.<br> I'll lose my job if they find out<br> I turned in that alarm.<br> Maybe we'd better talk this over.<br> How about a date tonight?<br> - No.<br> - Okay.<br> I'll try to inject this<br> so it won't hurt you much.<br> Hey, you're not really going<br> to do that?<br> What do you think?<br> - I'll scream.<br> - And lose your job?<br> All right, you win.<br> - It's a date?<br> - Yes.<br> Where do you live?<br> Hurry, somebody's coming.<br> - 1622 Rex Hill, apartment 31.<br> - Is 8:00 all right?<br> - It's a little late for dinner, isn't it?<br> - We'll make it 8, just the same.<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, it's Kitty. It's my new girl.<br> Oh, she's... Oh, the poor little thing.<br> She's fainted.<br> Oh, there, there.<br> Poor darling.<br> I'm looking forward to<br> a five-course dinner, including a tenderloin.<br> That's the least I'll settle for.<br> You've got a lot more faith in dates<br> than I have.<br> Me too.<br> I haven't made up my mind whether<br> I should demand dancing or not.<br> How do I look?<br> That shade of hose<br> isn't very leg-flattering.<br> Well, maybe it's just as well.<br> They've got me in plenty of jams as it is.<br> The doctor, I dare say.<br> - Okay, we're leaving.<br> - Goodbye, now.<br> You needn't rush away on my account.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> And how is our little patient<br> this evening?<br> If you're referring to me,<br> I'm all right.<br> I'm fine too.<br> You know, once you get<br> to thinking about it...<br> ...that was a very funny way<br> we met this afternoon.<br> Now, just a minute, doctor.<br> I agreed to have a date with you,<br> and I intend to keep my word...<br> ...but if you think I'm going<br> to join you in a laugh...<br> ...over that trick of yours,<br> you're on the wrong trapeze.<br> I'm sorry. I just thought we might<br> sit around and reminisce.<br> They're not going, they're staying.<br> I knew that guy was a squatter.<br> I got goose pimples when I heard<br> the buzzer.<br> That's always a sure sign.<br> - Well, let's throw Kitty a lifeline.<br> - Okay, let's.<br> - It's a nice little place you got here.<br> - We've got here.<br> I share it with two other girls.<br> In times like these,<br> what could be better?<br> Sharing it with one.<br> You know the first thing I thought of<br> when I saw you this afternoon?<br> Yes.<br> - Good night.<br> - Oh, please, please.<br> I'm sorry. I won't do it again. I promise.<br> You walk awfully close to the edge,<br> doctor.<br> I was just trying to get the range,<br> that's all.<br> Pardon me.<br> Pardon me.<br> Is that one of them?<br> That's Molly. I'm sorry,<br> I forgot to introduce you.<br> Never give it a second thought.<br> Oh, Pat, this is Dr. Mark. Miss Day.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> Say, what is this, a gag?<br> They're just relaxed, that's all.<br> I've seen better specimens in a glass jar.<br> Well, what's your program?<br> Do you like to play cards?<br> No. And besides, we haven't any.<br> That's a very funny thing...<br> ...but as chance would have it,<br> I happen to have a deck right here.<br> - Now, isn't that a strange coincidence?<br> - Yes, isn't it?<br> Double solitaire?<br> Well, we're hooked.<br> He's digging in for the night.<br> Poor Kitty. Her first date,<br> and she draws a guy that's slapjack-happy.<br> Well, I guess I'll finish the laundry.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm any judge of that guy's character...<br> ...I'll be able to finish this book.<br> Jack, queen, king.<br> Seventeen games to three.<br> - Swell coffee.<br> - It's a little too strong for me.<br> It's been keeping me awake.<br> - You're not so very good at sol, are you?<br> - Not when I'm hungry.<br> Do you mind if I ask you something?<br> I thought we had a date tonight.<br> Well, what do you think<br> has been going on here?<br> Well, for one thing,<br> I've slowly grown to hate you.<br> - Me, but why?<br> - Because I'm hungry.<br> Because I thought you were going<br> to take me out to dinner.<br> But how could I<br> when all I got is a dime?<br> Well, we could go out and spend that.<br> Don't be silly.<br> What could two people get?<br> Coffee, and we've got coffee.<br> Well, anyway, I've had<br> an awfully nice time.<br> Well, I'm so glad. We must do it<br> again sometime, and soon too.<br> You've taken an awful beating,<br> haven't you?<br> You should know.<br> I don't know how to tell you this,<br> but this has been kind of a test.<br> You mean you've been testing me?<br> Don't make it sound so awful.<br> It's just that the girl I fall for<br> mustn't be a gold digger.<br> I simply haven't got the dough for it.<br> So I've always told myself<br> I'd never fall for one...<br> ...unless I could get to liking her<br> without spending money.<br> That's just for the first evening,<br> you understand?<br> Well, how did I come out?<br> You're okay.<br> I'd like to point out that anything<br> I did to prove that to you...<br> ...was purely unintentional.<br> I know that.<br> How about the movies Saturday night?<br> I'm sorry, I can't afford it.<br> Forget that, I'll pay.<br> - Coal Oil Johnny, eh?<br> - And the bus both ways.<br> Well, I never thought I'd fall for<br> a flashy front, but it's a date.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> All clear.<br> He's gone.<br> So am I.<br> If he'd stayed another five minutes,<br> I'd have asked him for rent.<br> I bet I know what his answer<br> would have been.<br> What made him rush off?<br> His cards began to wear out.<br> All the same,<br> that boy will get somewhere.<br> What makes you think so?<br> The way he saves his money.<br> Well, it's better than staying home<br> alone nights.<br> Sure, it's better than having your leg<br> amputated, but that's no sign it's good.<br> Oh, I'm too sleepy<br> to make up my bed tonight.<br> Douse the light, Molly,<br> so you kids can get some sleep.<br> Kitty.<br> Whatever happened to that fellow<br> in Philadelphia?<br> You know, the knight in shining armor?<br> Oh, him?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I guess he must have<br> caught the wrong horse.<br> What's the matter, don't you like<br> this poor man's caviar?<br> Sure. I was just studying.<br> You know, there's a lot to be seen<br> on the subway if you can read.<br> Ads or faces?<br> People. It's good practice.<br> Now you take Slim.<br> What do you figure he is?<br> - Ballet dancer?<br> - He looks more like a real-estater to me.<br> I'd say he's got two kids,<br> a house in Brooklyn and a skinny wife.<br> He's plenty worried about something.<br> Well, it's about 11:00,<br> and he didn't get home for dinner.<br> He's wondering what<br> he's gonna tell the wife.<br> He stopped worrying about that<br> years ago.<br> Well, then he's worrying<br> about the usual thing:<br> How to get ahead in the world.<br> We all think about that.<br> Not me. I'm all set.<br> I'm taking a job in a kis clinic.<br> It won't pay as much as handling<br> a bunch of Park Avenue neurotics, but...<br> You see that little kid over there?<br> He's gonna be like that<br> for the rest of his life.<br> Weak, frail and unhappy.<br> Thousands of little guys just like him,<br> right here in New York.<br> And what they need is a little attention,<br> whether they can pay for it or not.<br> Why, Mark, you're an idealist.<br> Not me. I don't even like them.<br> Idealists?<br> Oh, they're always going around<br> patting themselves on the back.<br> That's to save you the trouble.<br> Next stop, 96th Street.<br> That's us.<br> Now, you take me, I like idealists.<br> Kitty?<br> You ever fall in love?<br> What kind of a fellow?<br> I don't know what you'd call him.<br> But I thought he was pretty wonderful.<br> You still love him, huh?<br> Well, why didn't you marry him then?<br> I guess he had too much money.<br> Oh, Kitty, you must be running a fever.<br> Nobody's got too much money.<br> He did.<br> You mean you want a poor man?<br> I don't want anybody.<br> The trouble with rich fellows is, they<br> haven't any way of telling they're in love.<br> Now, you take me. A fellow like me<br> knows when he's falling in love.<br> And he knows whether or not<br> it's the real thing.<br> Well, that's very interesting.<br> How do you know<br> when you're falling in love?<br> Well, I don't make very much dough...<br> ...and when I find myself<br> wanting to spend 10 bucks on a girl...<br> ...well, then I know I'm falling in love.<br> Well, you're still safe then.<br> That's just the point. I'm not.<br> Kitty, how'd you like to go out<br> Friday night? Dinner and dancing?<br> You mean you wanna<br> take me out to dinner?<br> Yes, Friday night. Do it up brown.<br> Okay?<br> Okay.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Same as usual?<br> Yes, please, Billy.<br> What do you still buy<br> that Philadelphia paper for?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Just to keep up with<br> the old town, I guess.<br> You'd like to keep up<br> with that boyfriend.<br> Seems to me, after all this time,<br> it'd be smart to forget him.<br> What's the matter?<br> Tonight's the assembly in Philadelphia.<br> Wyn will be there in his shining armor.<br> And you'll be going out with Mark<br> and his shining stethoscope.<br> Here's your change.<br> Violets.<br> Violets, five cents.<br> Sure.<br> I'll have some violets.<br> Two bunches, please.<br> What is all this?<br> Oh, I don't know. Somebody's cuckoo.<br> These have been coming in all evening.<br> I know the delivery boy<br> like a brother already.<br> You know what I've got in the bathtub?<br> Water lilies. They're all for you.<br> Don't ask me who they're from.<br> The cards are full of mush,<br> but they're all unsigned.<br> And look here.<br> It says this is a oriental meat-eating plant<br> and needs to be fed three times a day.<br> Well, have you fed it yet?<br> If you think I'm giving up<br> the best years of my...<br> He's a fool.<br> - What is it?<br> - What's so funny?<br> It's Wyn.<br> I know it. Girls, please.<br> - Okay, I'll take the bathroom.<br> - Yeah, we'll join the water lilies.<br> Come in.<br> Oh, Wyn.<br> Kitty.<br> - Darling.<br> - Oh, Wyn, I knew it.<br> Darling.<br> I just got here and look what I found.<br> And I bought myself<br> a dime's worth of violets.<br> Oh, darling, how did you ever find me?<br> I just followed my heartbeat.<br> Shall I go outside while you dress,<br> or shall I just close my eyes?<br> - Dress?<br> - Yes.<br> I told you I was going<br> to take you to the assembly.<br> Well, tonight's the night.<br> Only ours is going to be<br> right here in New York.<br> And you remembered.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Where you going?<br> Think it'll do?<br> Isn't that beautiful?<br> Oh, it's beautiful, and I'm so happy.<br> And you're so crazy.<br> I think I forgot<br> to tell you something.<br> - What?<br> - How much I love you.<br> How much do you love me?<br> If I said I loved you as much as you<br> love me, would that be enough?<br> Oh, if that were true, there wouldn't be any<br> love left for anybody in the whole world.<br> Mouth and ear<br> ought to be close together.<br> Like those new French telephones.<br> - Hey.<br> - Lips quicker than the eye.<br> Besides, nobody knows<br> who we are, or cares.<br> Darling, you look like the wrapping<br> around the neck of a champagne bottle.<br> Now I feel like something<br> wrapped around your neck.<br> You like to dance, don't you?<br> All women do. It's good training.<br> How do you mean?<br> The first way a girl learns what<br> a man is going to do before he does it.<br> We're all alone really, aren't we?<br> And yet, we're surrounded by people.<br> It's because you and I together<br> make something entirely different...<br> ...from either of us<br> when we're separated.<br> A new element.<br> Like in chemistry.<br> We'll always be alone...<br> ...as long as we're together.<br> How long has Nijinsky over there<br> rented the joint for?<br> Five a. M.<br> That's when some dance<br> in Philadelphia ends.<br> It's 5:00.<br> It's 5:00.<br> Well, the assembly's over.<br> Oh, I don't ever want it to stop.<br> How about some scrambled eggs,<br> little sausages...<br> ...and champagne?<br> Is that traditional at the assembly?<br> From the beginning.<br> The eggs and sausages were added<br> in 1897. Thank you.<br> All I'm asking is that the orchestra<br> come up to my room...<br> ...and play for us while we have eggs.<br> Dear sir, we have other guests<br> in the hotel, and it's early.<br> I only want soft music.<br> Show him how softly you can play.<br> There, you see?<br> Now very softly.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Strafford.<br> What a town.<br> Come on, boys. Bring the wine.<br> And to think that just 24 hours ago...<br> ...this day started out like<br> any other old day in the year.<br> Can you think of anybody<br> we haven't drunk to?<br> Nobody left but strangers.<br> Very well, to the people we don't know.<br> In five minutes,<br> the alarm will be going off.<br> Shut it off. I'm awake.<br> See this?<br> What is it, an heirloom?<br> It was my great-grandmother's.<br> It's the symbol of eternal life,<br> from her to me...<br> ...and you...<br> ...to those that come after us, forever.<br> It's our family.<br> You better put it away then<br> if it's family stuff.<br> Boys...<br> ...can you play<br> "Tales from the Vienna Woods"?<br> But feebly.<br> I don't know why I should<br> need all this background, but, Kitty...<br> ...will you marry me?<br> Will you?<br> No, darling.<br> Don't you love me?<br> But you won't marry me?<br> Why not?<br> Well, Wyn, darling...<br> ...we're happy now, aren't we?<br> I mean here, this minute.<br> Of course we are.<br> But do you know why?<br> Because... Because we love each other.<br> Because we're together.<br> No, that's not it.<br> It's because we're not in Philadelphia.<br> Honey, this is no time for joking.<br> In New York, we're happy,<br> at Pocono, we're happy.<br> In Seattle, in New Orleans,<br> in Dallas, Texas, we could be happy.<br> But not in Philadelphia.<br> Everywhere else, we're just<br> two people in love.<br> A tall, good-natured guy<br> and a sassy mick...<br> ...minding our own business<br> and bothering nobody.<br> You see what I mean?<br> - Listen, Kitty...<br> - In Philadelphia, you're Darby Mill...<br> ...and I'm Griscom Street.<br> We're two addresses...<br> ...23 miles and 500 light-years apart.<br> Griscom Street could stand it...<br> ...but not Darby Mill.<br> Oh, Wyn, darling, I wish I could<br> see you happy that way...<br> ...but I just can't.<br> And is that all?<br> Well, we're both the same color,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> Boys, "The Sidewalks of New York."<br> "Sidewalks of New York."<br> - Hey, what's the idea?<br> - It's all fixed.<br> That's our theme song now.<br> We're New Yorkers.<br> Both of us.<br> Oh, Wyn, you're not kidding?<br> No, darling, I really mean it.<br> I wish you weren't so right<br> about all that in Philadelphia...<br> ...but you are...<br> ...so that's the end of it.<br> This is where we'll live,<br> where we'll be happy.<br> Wyn, I'm so happy now.<br> I'm so happy I can't tell you how much.<br> They don't know it...<br> ...but they're wedding bells...<br> ...for us.<br> No Main Line?<br> No Philadelphia?<br> Just you and me?<br> Me and you.<br> Oh, dear God...<br> ...don't ring the alarm clock now...<br> ...for just a little while.<br> But the alarm did ring.<br> It had a funny little jangle, and you seemed<br> to hear it all the way back to Philadelphia.<br> You couldn't very well say no<br> when Wyn wanted to go back...<br> ...just long enough to tell his family.<br> So there you were,<br> Mr. And Mrs. Wynnewood Strafford VI...<br> ...coming home<br> to announce their marriage.<br> - You aren't getting scared, are you?<br> - Leave it to me, honey.<br> All right, but don't forget this<br> is the big one. Don't fumble it.<br> After you, Mrs. Strafford.<br> Would you mind saying that again?<br> I said, "After you, Mrs. Strafford."<br> Thank you.<br> - Harrison.<br> - Good afternoon, Mr. Strafford.<br> Where's Mother?<br> The family's taking tea<br> in the drawing room, sir.<br> Don't let Uncle Kennett scare you.<br> He's an old Quaker banker and only knows<br> three words, "thee," "thou" and "no."<br> Well, get ready. Here goes the bell.<br> - Hello, everybody.<br> - Wyn, dear, come in.<br> - Mother, you remember Kitty.<br> - Indeed I do.<br> - It's so nice to see you again, Miss Foyle.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And you remember my grandmother.<br> - Why, yes.<br> And Aunt Jessica.<br> - Uncle Edgar and Uncle Kennett.<br> - Miss Foyle.<br> The fact is, the name<br> isn't Foyle anymore.<br> It's Strafford.<br> Kitty and I have been married.<br> Well, why doesn't somebody<br> say something?<br> Or is she so beautiful<br> she's taken your breath away?<br> - Congratulations, my boy.<br> - Yes, yes, of course, Wyn. Congratulations.<br> Well, shall we all sit down?<br> - Will you have tea?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Wyn?<br> - No, Mother.<br> - When were you married?<br> - Last Saturday.<br> - I see.<br> - I thought he was going to wait a year.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> Wyn had told us<br> how much he loved you...<br> ...and we couldn't have been happier,<br> for his sake.<br> Do the papers know about this?<br> I don't know. I don't suppose so.<br> We'll have the Darby Mill house<br> redecorated for them.<br> Tell them our plans, Wyn.<br> Of course, Kitty, this would have been<br> so much more simple...<br> ...if Wyn hadn't been quite so impetuous.<br> I thought you were going<br> to send her to school first?<br> You do understand, of course,<br> that above everything else...<br> ...we want your happiness, and his.<br> That's foremost<br> in all our thoughts, isn't it?<br> - Naturally.<br> - Oh, naturally, of course, of course.<br> I don't mean to be rude...<br> ...but would somebody please tell me<br> what you all are driving at?<br> - Well, it's like this, my dear...<br> - Now, Mother, please.<br> You see, honey. I had promised them<br> that we wouldn't be married for a year.<br> Mother was going to take you<br> under her wing and, well, prepare you.<br> Prepare me?<br> Prepare me for what?<br> Well, you know, finishing school,<br> and then later...<br> School?<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> - It needn't be school.<br> It can still be arranged.<br> Later on, when we've had an opportunity<br> to acquaint her with our friends...<br> ...we can still have a proper wedding.<br> - Certainly.<br> And what do you call what<br> we've just done? A rehearsal?<br> Now, wait a minute...<br> I do realize that we all sound<br> most frightfully snobbish.<br> But, my dear, we realize too<br> that you have not been accustomed...<br> ...to the kind of life that you<br> will have to lead with Wyn.<br> - So we'd planned to have...<br> - What about our plans?<br> Aren't you going to tell them?<br> What's the matter, doesn't she<br> want to go to school?<br> School is out, definitely.<br> I'm a big girl now.<br> Wyn and I are not<br> going to live in Philadelphia.<br> You're not the only ones<br> that want us happy...<br> ...and we couldn't be in Philadelphia.<br> I'm Griscom Street and he's Main Line,<br> and we both know it.<br> In Philadelphia, that's fatal.<br> Anywhere else in the whole world,<br> it doesn't make a difference.<br> And so that's where<br> we're going to live.<br> Anywhere else in the world.<br> - Isn't that right?<br> - Of course...<br> This is all very provoking.<br> But, Miss Foyle, thou must realize<br> that such a thing is quite impossible.<br> And why?<br> It happens that the Strafford money<br> is a trust fund.<br> Established by family wills.<br> They provide that Wyn,<br> when he takes unto himself a wife...<br> ...shall reside at Darby Mill...<br> ...and shall assume his duties<br> as an officer of the family bank.<br> And those terms are irrevocable.<br> So you see, my dear, there's nothing<br> we can do about it, any of us.<br> It's just the way Wyn's money<br> has been left to him.<br> You mean all those people who are dead<br> can tell us what to do?<br> You mean that Wyn<br> can't live his own life?<br> Within the limits of his<br> responsibilities, yes.<br> And what if Wyn refuses?<br> In that case...<br> ...his inheritance would<br> pass into the family trust.<br> Well, so what?<br> So Wyn isn't rich anymore.<br> Well, so, what is that to me?<br> I didn't marry Wyn for his money.<br> I don't care if he hasn't got a penny.<br> But, Miss Foyle, thou are not being<br> quite reasonable about this.<br> - Says thou.<br> - Miss Foyle, thy temper.<br> Mr. Kennett, thy foot.<br> Let's get a few things straight around here.<br> I didn't ask to marry a Strafford,<br> he asked me.<br> I married a man, not an institution<br> or a trust fund or a bank.<br> Oh, I've got a fine picture of your<br> family conference here.<br> The Straffords trying to figure out<br> how to take the curse off Kitty Foyle.<br> Buy the girl a phony education,<br> polish off the edges...<br> ...and make a Main Line doll out of her.<br> Oh, you ought to know better that that.<br> It takes six generations to make<br> a bunch of people like you.<br> And by Judas Priest,<br> I haven't got that much time.<br> Kitty.<br> Darling, please, I've got to talk to you.<br> Darling...<br> ...please try to understand<br> the family's point of view.<br> You can't just square off at them.<br> It's no use, Wyn.<br> They've got you under contract.<br> Kitty...<br> ...we're going to New York,<br> you and I.<br> Live our lives just as we planned.<br> And that means giving up<br> your inheritance...<br> ...and everything your family has<br> built up for you, doesn't it?<br> That's all right.<br> I can make some kind of a living.<br> Can you learn to live in a one-room<br> apartment with a pull-down bed...<br> ...eat in drugstores,<br> go to movies once a week...<br> ...and save a dollar or two against<br> the time when you haven't got a job?<br> - Do you think you could learn that, Wyn?<br> - If we're together.<br> Do you think you'd be happy<br> living that way?<br> Wait here, Kitty.<br> I'm going in and tell them.<br> You left for good that time.<br> Back to New York and your old job.<br> Oh, you went through<br> the motions of living...<br> ...but you really weren't living at all.<br> It's not living when you'd give an<br> eyetooth just to hear someone say hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Well, hello, Mark.<br> - It's been quite a while, hasn't it, Kitty?<br> - Yes.<br> How about going someplace<br> for a drink?<br> I'm sorry, Mark, I...<br> Oh, you don't have to explain to me.<br> Come on.<br> Here's a place.<br> Quite a place too, they tell me.<br> Yes, quite a place.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - Anything you like.<br> Give us something kind of special.<br> Strega?<br> Yes, two of them.<br> Say, what is Strega, anyhow?<br> It's an Italian drink.<br> You'll see. It has a picture<br> of a witch on the bottle.<br> They say that if two people<br> drink it together...<br> ...they'll never drink it apart.<br> It's been a long time<br> since I've seen you.

He always gives me one.<br> Well, you can give this to your daddy...<br> ...but it has got to be a secret.<br> Oh, no, that's just for your daddy...<br> ...but it's a secret.<br> Here he is.<br> He darted away so quickly,<br> we thought we'd lost him.<br> I'll be coming in again soon.<br> Could I have your name?<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> You see, we're not allowed<br> to give out our names.<br> Oh, that's too bad. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye...<br> ...Mrs. Strafford.<br> There you are, kid.<br> There's the record.<br> Mark's waiting for you<br> at St. Timothy's...<br> ...and here's Wyn again.<br> Think fast, Captain Foyle.<br> - Got your bags ready, Miss Foyle?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> What time is it?<br> Twenty-five to 12, ma'am.<br> Will you tell the doorman<br> to call a cab for me?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Goodbye, Tim.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Are you gonna be gone long?<br> - Permanently.<br> - Mighty sorry to lose you.<br> - Thank you, Tim.<br> We don't get very many<br> pretty girls here, you know.<br> - Tim.<br> - Yes?<br> I think a young man will call for me<br> a little after midnight.<br> He'll be quite excited, I think,<br> and rather insistent...<br> ...and I want you to tell him<br> for me that...<br> Now just a minute.<br> I want to get this straight.<br> I want you to tell him that I...<br> I admire him very much,<br> and I always will.<br> You admire him very much and...<br> And that I'll never forget him.<br> And you will never forget...<br> Tell him that I'll always love him<br> in a very special way.<br> You'll always love him<br> in a very special...<br> And that I'm going to be<br> married tonight.<br> And you're going to be...<br> - St. Timothy's Hospital.<br> - Yes, miss.<br> Well, Judas Priest.<br>
