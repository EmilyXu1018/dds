                        We've got two tons of potatoes.<br> Tom!<br> I'll drink to that.<br> Did you know the subject,<br> Thomas Grunemann?<br> - Yes.<br> - Very well.<br> He was my best friend.<br> We grew up together.<br> Can you account for his<br> disappearance in anyway?<br> - Mrs. Grunemann?<br> - No.<br> Did he recently appear to be agitated<br> or depressed in any way?<br> No.<br> Mr. Cable, at the plant...<br> ...did he voice any grievance<br> or discontent about his work there?<br> Not at all.<br> As a matter of fact, Tom operated best<br> when he was under pressure.<br> Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann,<br> but I have to ask.<br> Did your husband ever show...<br> ...any moral or sexual problems<br> or peculiarities?<br> No.<br> Any marital problems in general, that is?<br> We were very happy.<br> Did he ever mention specifically,<br> a girl or a woman in New York City?<br> No.<br> - No.<br> - Why?<br> We recovered in his desk at the plant...<br> ...in one of the drawers...<br> ...a typewritten letter<br> that was evidently written...<br> ...on the Friday before he disappeared.<br> It was written to a girl in New York City...<br> ...and we contacted the police.<br> They brought her in, questioned her...<br> ...and she said that she had received<br> six or seven letters of this kind.<br> Can I see it?<br> Well, it's an obscene letter,<br> Mrs. Grunemann.<br> I would like to see it.<br> I would like you to remember that<br> it was written by a very disturbed man.<br> I don't believe it.<br> I'd like you to know that situations<br> of this kind are not unique.<br> A man will lead a double life.<br> A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence<br> and his wife has no idea what's going on.<br> Has anybody...<br> ... talked to you about<br> the financial arrangements?<br> Well, that depends, naturally,<br> on how long you want me for...<br> ... and what you want to do.<br> I know you.<br> It will be very nice.<br> I'd like to spend the evening<br> with you if it's...<br> If you'd like that.<br> Have you ever been with a woman before?<br> Paying her?<br> Do you like it?<br> I mean, I have the feeling that<br> that turns you on very particularly.<br> What turns me on is because I have...<br> ... a good imagination and I like...<br> ... pleasing.<br> Do you mind if I take my sweater off?<br> I think in the confines of one's house,<br> one should be...<br> ... free of clothing and inhibitions.<br> Inhibitions are always nice<br> because they're so nice to overcome.<br> Don't be afraid. I'm not.<br> As long as you don't hurt me<br> more than I like to be hurt...<br> ... I will do anything you ask.<br> You should never be ashamed<br> of things like that. You mustn't be.<br> You know, there's nothing wrong.<br> Nothing is wrong.<br> I think the only way<br> that any of us can ever be happy...<br> ... is to let it all hang out.<br> You know, do it all and fuck it!<br> All right.<br> Would you stand up, please?<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi, can I see your eyes?<br> Let me see your hair.<br> - Take your hat off.<br> - Take my hat off?<br> Yeah. Okay.<br> - Too pretty.<br> - Too pretty.<br> Now, that's the color.<br> The coloring is great. I don't know.<br> - It's not quite it though.<br> - No, not really.<br> Hello. Can I see your hands?<br> - Thank you.<br> - She's got funny hands.<br> - Hi.<br> - She is great.<br> - Beautiful eyes.<br> - Yes.<br> - All right. That's the coloring.<br> - Yeah, let me see you smile.<br> - I think she has that cross between...<br> - She's great. But I've seen you before.<br> - I think so.<br> - Have you done any cosmetic ads?<br> - Yes, I have.<br> - You have?<br> - How do they send people with a conflict?<br> - It's got to be a new face.<br> Call that agency.<br> - Irene Dunne would've had it.<br> - That would be perfect.<br> - C minus.<br> - C minus.<br> - Got to find her today.<br> - That's it. Thank you, ladies.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm exhausted.<br> One more day of this and I'll plop.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Just have a seat, please.<br> It's been six months. Tom Grunemann<br> has been missing for half a year.<br> And all the FBI has to offer is<br> a report that must bore even you.<br> There are thousands of honest, decent men<br> who simply disappear every year.<br> Neither Mrs. Grunemann<br> nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.<br> And therefore we feel entitled<br> to investigate on our own.<br> You're entitled.<br> There are some very competent...<br> John Klute offered us his services,<br> and we've accepted.<br> Klute knew Tom,<br> and he has many ideas about the case.<br> Have you ever done<br> missing persons work before?<br> No.<br> - Have you spent any time in the city?<br> - No.<br> Well, speaking frankly...<br> You're wondering why<br> we thought of Klute?<br> Frankly...<br> ...he's interested.<br> And he cares.<br> Why didn't you ever find out<br> anything from that girl?<br> We held her under surveillance...<br> ...expecting your boy Grunemann<br> to show up there.<br> He didn't.<br> We arrested her<br> on a C.P. Charge. Convicted.<br> Two months women's city prison.<br> Offered to reduce sentence.<br> She cooperated.<br> She thought she remembered him<br> from those letters from before.<br> She made that connection.<br> But she hadn't seen him since then<br> and couldn't identify his photograph.<br> A good call girl,<br> she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.<br> Faces get blurred.<br> And since then,<br> she's reported several incidents...<br> ... like breather calls,<br> anonymous phone calls.<br> Also, somebody may be following her,<br> watching her.<br> Things like that.<br> So I guess it's conceivable<br> that Grunemann's still around there.<br> Still bugging her.<br> Hey, Trina! Bree.<br> Listen, I could use a quick $50.<br> You got a commuter for me?<br> Terrific.<br> Right.<br> Terrific. Yeah. 'Bye.<br> Hi. I'm Bree.<br> Yeah. Come in, please.<br> I'm glad to know you, Bree.<br> I'm glad you could come. Sit down, please.<br> Where are you from?<br> Can I get you a drink?<br> Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale. Thank you.<br> I'm from Chicago.<br> You come to New York often?<br> No, I don't come to New York too often.<br> - Too bad.<br> - Three times a year maybe.<br> What kind of party did you have in mind?<br> We could have<br> a nice half-and-half party for $50.<br> We could have a good time for $50.<br> Or if you wanted something extra,<br> it would be a little more.<br> - Maybe a nice...<br> - Listen, would it be all right...<br> Tell me what you want.<br> Tell me what you want.<br> That sounds fantastic.<br> That's so exciting.<br> But it's going to cost you more.<br> That's fantastic.<br> That's going to be $100.<br> - Sure, fine.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yes, very good.<br> - $100.<br> Very good.<br> I like to get business done<br> at the beginning.<br> That way we don't have to think about it,<br> then we can...<br> ...just have a good time.<br> I like your mind.<br> Yes.<br> So.<br> Chicago.<br> This is the bed?<br> This is the bed.<br> Very nice.<br> There's the bed in operating position.<br> You're so nice.<br> Come here.<br> Angel. My angel!<br> "We gather together<br> "to ask the Lord's blessing<br> "He hastens<br> "and chastens his wisdom divine<br> "and from the beginning<br> "the fight we were winning<br> "Lord, be at our side...<br> "divine"<br> It's 12:00 a.m.<br> This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.<br> Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback<br> in voltage to conserve generating capacity.<br> At three percent...<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> - Who is it?<br> - Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.<br> John Klute. And I'd like to talk to you.<br> - What do you want?<br> - My name is John Klute.<br> You said that.<br> I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you<br> some questions about Tom Grunemann.<br> - Who?<br> - Tom Grunemann.<br> He wrote you some letters.<br> Wow.<br> He was a research engineer at<br> the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.<br> He disappeared from there last December.<br> - I've been hired to look for him.<br> - Why?<br> You know what I'm talking about,<br> Miss Daniel.<br> Honest.<br> Can I ask you some questions please?<br> Do you have any identification?<br> You're not a cop? You're not FBI?<br> You're a private detective?<br> And you just want<br> to ask me some questions?<br> - They're not very recent. That's last year.<br> - They're quite good.<br> What have you done that I might have seen<br> on Broadway or off-Broadway?<br> - Well, I study with George Tainter.<br> - George? George is very good.<br> He's a good man to begin with.<br> I've been in two of his productions.<br> - Two of his workshop productions.<br> - Workshop.<br> Well, they're very nice.<br> How do you feel about being an actress?<br> - I like it very much.<br> - You think you know yourself?<br> - As much as anybody.<br> - Do you really know yourself?<br> - No.<br> - That's very important.<br> - I forget myself when I act.<br> - You can't forget yourself.<br> You have to know yourself<br> and kind of like yourself.<br> You have to relate. Relate to people.<br> I had an identity crisis<br> two years ago and since then...<br> ...I've been working to know myself.<br> That's very important.<br> Don't hide your face.<br> You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.<br> Excuse me just a second.<br> Julian? Yes, okay, send her in.<br> Well, I'm very busy.<br> Thank you for stopping by.<br> If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...<br> How are you today?<br> I won't be able to come back anymore.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Because I just can't afford it.<br> Did I fail you, Bree?<br> I come here all the time,<br> I pay you all this money...<br> ...and why do I still want to trick?<br> Why do I still...<br> ...walk by a phone<br> and want to pick up the phone and call?<br> Did you think I had some magic potion?<br> You'd come in and tell me your problem<br> and I would just take it away?<br> What's the difference<br> between going on a call...<br> ...as a model or an actress, as a call girl?<br> You're successful as a call girl...<br> Because when you're a call girl<br> you control it, that's why.<br> Because someone wants you.<br> Not me.<br> I mean, there are some johns that I have<br> regularly that want me...<br> ...and that's terrific.<br> But they want a woman...<br> ...and I know I'm good.<br> I arrive at their hotel or their apartment...<br> ...and they're usually nervous,<br> which is fine, because I'm not.<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> For an hour...<br> ...I'm the best actress in the world.<br> I'm the best fuck in the world. And...<br> Why did you say<br> you're the best actress in the world?<br> - At that time?<br> - Because it's an act.<br> That's what's nice about it.<br> You don't have to feel anything.<br> You don't have to...<br> ...care about anything.<br> You don't have to like anybody.<br> You just...<br> ...lead them by the ring in their nose<br> in the direction they think they want to go.<br> You get a lot of money out of them<br> in as short period of time as possible.<br> You control it and you call the shots...<br> ...and I always feel just great afterwards.<br> - And you enjoyed it?<br> - No.<br> Why not?<br> You say there's nothing wrong.<br> Why not? You said...<br> There's a difference. I don't think<br> there's anything wrong with it...<br> ...morally. I didn't enjoy it physically.<br> I came to enjoy it<br> because it made me feel good.<br> It made me feel like I wasn't alone.<br> It made me feel...<br> ...that I had some control over myself,<br> that I had some control over my life.<br> That I could determine things for myself.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know why I'm here.<br> It's just so silly to think that<br> somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?<br> I could come over tonight. Are you alone?<br> In about an hour.<br> Okay. See you in an hour.<br> Bree.<br> You look beautiful.<br> Thank you.<br> Enjoy.<br> - It's good to see you again.<br> - Likewise.<br> I've just got back from Cannes, you know.<br> And I...<br> Well...<br> ...I have something<br> rather exciting to tell you.<br> Yes?<br> Cannes was very amusing.<br> We played baccarat and chemin de fer.<br> A very nice little Italian marquis<br> was rather enthusiastic about me.<br> But a young man can be so silly.<br> Then one night...<br> ...at the gambling tables...<br> ...I saw him.<br> A stranger, he was looking at me.<br> He was standing very still<br> on the other side of the room...<br> ...and his eyes were looking right into me.<br> And I knew that<br> for the first time in my life...<br> Please.<br> Not young. He wasn't young.<br> He had gray sideburns.<br> - Actually, he looked rather like you.<br> - Yes?<br> No one could tell me who he was.<br> Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?<br> But there was a feeling stirring inside me,<br> a pagan feeling.<br> The next day on the beach<br> in my beach pavilion...<br> It was so warm on the sand...<br> ...and I saw him again.<br> He was staring at me.<br> His eyes were burning into me.<br> I was helpless.<br> He didn't even have to say anything,<br> and I knew.<br> I knew that somehow...<br> You know, I've never liked young men.<br> And I knew...<br> ...that he would awaken something in me...<br> ...that no young man had ever awakened.<br> He was so wise...<br> ...and he taught me so many things...<br> ...with his hands.<br> In his eyes I felt so beautiful.<br> Miss Daniel.<br> Can I come upstairs<br> and ask you some questions now?<br> You bastard!<br> Is this the shakedown, hon?<br> You picked a loser. I don't have it!<br> I'm looking for Tom...<br> You think I'd live in this kip<br> if I were taking calls full-time?<br> - I'd be back on Park Avenue.<br> - Can I ask you some questions?<br> Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig,<br> you mean?<br> Have a seat.<br> Would you like some wine?<br> - Or some beer?<br> - No, thank you.<br> There isn't any beer anyway.<br> I've already told the police<br> everything I know.<br> I don't even remember the schlub!<br> They showed me that already.<br> I understand this is Grunemann.<br> I told them, I don't remember.<br> Family-type man. It figures.<br> Look...<br> ...will you please just try<br> to get it from my side?<br> A year ago...<br> ...I was in the life full-time.<br> Living on Park Avenue.<br> This very nice apartment, leather furniture.<br> And then the cops dropped on me.<br> They caged me.<br> Started asking me about a guy<br> that I'm supposed to have seen...<br> ...a year before that! Two years ago!<br> He could be in Yemen!<br> Grunemann, what does that mean?<br> It's a name, I don't know him!<br> And they start showing me these pictures,<br> and they don't mean anything to me.<br> Then they started asking me<br> if I'd been getting letters...<br> ...from some guy out in Cabbageville.<br> Tuscarora.<br> Yeah, all right, I had been.<br> Very sick letters.<br> So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.<br> "So would you please<br> tell us when you and he..."<br> Well, there was a guy once. A freak.<br> Could've been him.<br> Apparently Grunemann liked<br> to beat up on girls.<br> Well, this guy hired me<br> and then he tried to kill me...<br> ...and that was about two years ago.<br> Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.<br> I got the gumdrops.<br> You remind me of my uncle.<br> What else do you remember<br> about the man who beat you up?<br> Nothing.<br> Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.<br> See, usually it's a fake out.<br> You probably know about that.<br> They pretend to tie you up and whip you<br> while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.<br> Hell, it's their money, I don't care.<br> I'll swing from a shower rod<br> and whistle Maytime.<br> Except this guy really freaked out on it.<br> But you cannot identify this man<br> as Tom Grunemann?<br> I can't identify him as anybody!<br> So, is that it?<br> Listen...<br> ...why don't you go downstairs...<br> You have such a nice mouth.<br> ...and get those tapes?<br> Bring them back up here<br> and we'll have a party...<br> ...you and I.<br> - Wouldn't that be nice?<br> What about afterwards,<br> the telephone calls?<br> Just phone calls, right?<br> What is it? The phone rings,<br> you answer it, there's no one there.<br> Kids having fun,<br> burglars finding empty apartments.<br> It happens all the time.<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> But you reported<br> that you had been followed.<br> Look, I'm sorry.<br> I've been...<br> ...leading everybody astray. It doesn't...<br> Okay, I get these feelings,<br> but they're just feelings. That's just me.<br> I'm sure you'll find this amusing,<br> but I'm afraid of the dark.<br> Sometimes I get spooked.<br> I think I see people and hear things.<br> I go out in the morning and<br> I think somebody's opened my mailbox.<br> If there's trash in front of my door<br> I think somebody's trying to freak me out.<br> It's just nerves. I'm a nervous broad.<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> Bree Daniel.<br> How is Ted? Yes.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> I'd love to.<br> Maybe the next time you're in town?<br> I'd like to meet you very much.<br> You've got a nice voice.<br> I'm having a conversation<br> with a very nice cop.<br> He's not a cop actually, he's a private...<br> Is that how you get most of your dates?<br> Someone gives your name to somebody.<br> Most of them, yes.<br> And that's how you met<br> the man who beat you up?<br> I don't remember.<br> It was two years ago. God!<br> How else do you get dates then, pimps?<br> You're very square, cookie.<br> No, pimps don't get dates for you,<br> they just take your money.<br> The police have given me a list of names.<br> I'd like to ask you about them.<br> Frank Ligourin?<br> I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.<br> But I'm really trying<br> to get away from all that.<br> What about this evening, the old man?<br> You saw that?<br> Goddamn you!<br> He's 70 years old!<br> His wife's dead.<br> He's cut garments since he was 14.<br> He's maybe in his whole life<br> had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!<br> He never lays a hand on me!<br> What harm is there in that?<br> What's your bag, Klute?<br> What do you like? You a talker?<br> A button freak?<br> Like to have your chest walked around<br> with high-heel shoes?<br> - You like to have us watch you tinkle?<br> - Okay.<br> Or do you get it off<br> wearing women's clothes?<br> - Goddamn hypocrite squares!<br> - Okay.<br> I hope this isn't going<br> to make my cold any worse.<br> - Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.<br> - He was my old man. We broke up.<br> When?<br> - When did you break up?<br> - About eight months ago.<br> Would you mind not doing that?<br> What?<br> Okay?<br> Well, I thought I could trade you<br> for those tapes.<br> Doesn't it get Ionely down there<br> in your little room?<br> Maybe I could bring some friends.<br> I've got some terrific friends.<br> No, thank you.<br> Men have paid $200 for me<br> and here you are turning down a freebie.<br> You could get<br> a perfectly good dishwasher for that.<br> What are you doing with my keys?<br> Give me your hand.<br> I knew it.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> I'm going to sit you down on the bed.<br> There's someone on the roof.<br> Sit.<br> Sit!<br> Tom?<br> Tom?<br> - You didn't get him?<br> - No.<br> Was it Grunemann?<br> I didn't see him.<br> Who sent you on that date?<br> Frankie Ligourin.<br> You and I will go talk<br> to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.<br> Don't be afraid. I'm not.<br> Would you like me to hold you?<br> I'm just trying to figure you out.<br> I may say not many people<br> have been very successful at that.<br> That's all right. I'll figure you out<br> before the evening is over.<br> I hope you do,<br> and in a way, I hope you don't.<br> The only responsibility you have to me<br> is to enjoy yourself.<br> Inhibitions are always nice<br> because they're so nice to overcome.<br> - Because I'm very bad, you know.<br> - In what way? How are you bad?<br> In my head. I have very wicked ideas.<br> Lots of them.<br> I'm sure that as you're sitting<br> at your desk...<br> ... you've all kinds of strange things<br> going through your mind.<br> You should never be ashamed<br> of things like that.<br> Nothing is wrong.<br> You know that I will do anything you ask.<br> I think the only way<br> that any of us can ever be happy...<br> ... is to let it all hang out.<br> I was just finishing up some work.<br> Mocking up a few photographs.<br> I used to be a photographer.<br> Did Bree tell you?<br> Before I got into publishing.<br> He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.<br> He knows you were my pimp.<br> Excuse me.<br> Bree, why don't you wait outside?<br> I always respected Bree.<br> I'd like to make something clear.<br> - I just got a couple of questions.<br> - I want to make something clear.<br> I don't go after a girl.<br> Girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?<br> I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.<br> Miss Daniel tells me that the date<br> that beat her two years ago...<br> ...might've been that man,<br> and you sent her on that date.<br> Two years ago? Sorry.<br> I understand you use narcotics.<br> Maybe I could have someone come over<br> and look at your...<br> ...arms.<br> You know, I may stand better<br> with the cops than you do.<br> Why don't you sit down and relax?<br> It was a family matter.<br> Between the girls.<br> Had two other girls then.<br> Two other girls besides Bree.<br> One of them, Jane McKenna...<br> ...she blows a little jealous of Bree.<br> Bree comes first.<br> Evidently she knew this freak<br> who beats up on women.<br> She cons me into passing him on to Bree...<br> ...so Bree would get hurt.<br> I didn't know until afterwards.<br> You can't tell them one of<br> their own in-laws laid a freak on them.<br> Peace in the family.<br> Beyond that...<br> ...I don't know. That's all she wrote.<br> Did you see the man?<br> No.<br> How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?<br> Baby, would I be telling you all this?<br> She copped out long ago.<br> She committed suicide, Baxter.<br> And the other girl, what's her name?<br> - Arlyn?<br> - Page.<br> How do I find her?<br> I don't know. She's a junkie.<br> Make that scene, you could be anywhere.<br> Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.<br> Anything else?<br> Did you like my friend Frankie?<br> Not very much.<br> - Didn't he tell you what you wanted?<br> - Where can I find Arlyn Page?<br> You're not going to find Arlyn Page,<br> she's a junkie.<br> Didn't he tell you<br> that he sent me that guy?<br> Jane McKenna sent you that guy.<br> Well, she's dead.<br> Your tapes.<br> Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.<br> Dirty phone calls.<br> What for?<br> I'm through with your part of it.<br> You told me what you could.<br> Tell me, Klute...<br> ...did we get you a little?<br> Just a little bit? Us city folk.<br> The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?<br> All that's so pathetic.<br> Fuck off!<br> I'll tell you something, Jack.<br> It is in the bells that I hear my voices.<br> Not today when they all rang,<br> that was nothing but jangling.<br> But here, in this corner...<br> ...where the bells come down<br> from heaven and the echoes linger...<br> ...or in the fields where they come across<br> the quiet of the countryside...<br> ...my voices are in them.<br> Hark!<br> Do you hear?<br> "Dear child of God."<br> That's just what you said.<br> At the half-hour they will say,<br> "Be brave, go on."<br> At the three-quarters they will say,<br> "I am thy help."<br> When is it the hour.<br> When the great bell goes after:<br> "God will save France."<br> - It is then that St. Margaret...<br> - Thank you very much.<br> The script please.<br> Very interesting accent.<br> Booth!<br> Thank you.<br> All right, so what do you want, cop?<br> - I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.<br> - I told you you wouldn't find her.<br> If I can't find her, I can't find him,<br> and if I can't find him...<br> ...then you're in trouble.<br> So what do you say?<br> Okay?<br> It's going to cost. Time is money.<br> Okay. Well, I can pay you $100.<br> - I can make $100 in a lunch break.<br> - $100 is all I've got.<br> You were very good upstairs.<br> Kid, will you buy me a coffee?<br> Buy you lunch. Do you want lunch?<br> Come on.<br> Whenever it suits you.<br> No, make it...<br> ...Monday at 8:00 p.m.<br> I said Monday, 8:00 p.m.<br> Now don't be naughty!<br> He's a lovely man.<br> Comes here...<br> ...spends a bundle of money,<br> and never even touches the girls.<br> Comes from Grosse Pointe,<br> has a big house, eight servants...<br> ...but all he wants to do is come here<br> and scrub out my bathroom.<br> ...Mr. Clean.<br> Arlyn Page...<br> ...I had let her go.<br> With the kind of people I get...<br> ...I couldn't have a gal<br> who was zonked out all the time.<br> You know, I get the crme de la crme.<br> No, she was trouble...<br> ...and I don't allow any trouble here.<br> Che si pu fare?<br> Honni soit qui mal y pense.<br> Do you have any idea<br> where I can look for her?<br> Try Mama Reese's.<br> Bree...<br> ...if you get Ionely or have no place to go,<br> you come here.<br> You'll always have a home here.<br> Why?<br> She's a junkie.<br> She was with you after she left Frankie,<br> wasn't she?<br> Well, she's not now.<br> I tried to do everything for her.<br> I took her into my own place,<br> my own little flat on First.<br> You know that sweet place?<br> We could of had everything together.<br> Then the bitch sold my mink!<br> - Do you know anybody that's seen her?<br> - As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!<br> Who is it?<br> Bree Daniel.<br> I couldn't sleep.<br> I keep thinking I hear noises.<br> Can I come in?<br> Come in.<br> It was probably just my imagination.<br> Sit down.<br> I'm sorry I woke you up.<br> I just...<br> I don't think<br> he's going to come back again.<br> I just don't want to be alone right now.<br> Do you mind if I stay here a while?<br> - Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...<br> - I'd really rather not go upstairs.<br> Why don't you lie down here? Sleep here.<br> - Where are you going to sleep?<br> - I'll pull that out.<br> Lie down.<br> Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> What's the matter?<br> You were terrific.<br> A real tiger.<br> Are you upset<br> because you didn't make me come?<br> I never come with a john.<br> Don't feel bad about losing your virtue,<br> I sort of knew you would.<br> Everybody always does.<br> Arlyn Page?<br> Yes, she was with me about three months.<br> She was lucky I kept her that long.<br> She was out of it.<br> Somebody said she was streetwalking<br> over on Lexington Avenue.<br> Or was it Eighth? You might take a look.<br> Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.<br> Yes, she used to dress the way you do.<br> The whore? Yes, I threw her out.<br> Do you know where she went from here?<br> Live like animals, her and the man.<br> Out!<br> She was living with a man?<br> He was worse than the whore!<br> Cappy!<br> - Arlyn Page?<br> - Arlyn, it's Bree!<br> Cappy, is that you?<br> - It's all right.<br> - Cappy, we got a radio...<br> Arlyn, it's okay.<br> Bree, honey...<br> ...I'm waiting for someone.<br> You've got to help us.<br> Can't you see I'm strung out?<br> It'll only take you a couple of minutes.<br> A couple years ago,<br> Jane sent me a guy that beat me.<br> If he sees you, he won't come.<br> Was she seeing a freak,<br> one of her regular johns? Was he a freak?<br> Yes. What about it?<br> Did he come around a lot?<br> No, he was an older guy.<br> It's very important.<br> - Arlyn, get them out of here!<br> - I'm begging you!<br> It's very important, please.<br> - Can you give me a description of him?<br> - Cappy?<br> - Cappy, listen. No!<br> - Cappy, don't run!<br> Cappy, don't run! I've got a radio, Cappy!<br> She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.<br> A narcotics addict.<br> I believed her. I believed her absolutely.<br> The man who did those beatings<br> was not Tom Grunemann.<br> Suppose it wasn't Tom.<br> Where does that get you?<br> Tom is still connected because of<br> the letters, whether he wrote them or not.<br> The only way that I'm going to find him<br> is to find the man who did do the beatings.<br> The only way I'm going to find him<br> is to pursue Arlyn Page...<br> ...and try to secure<br> from her some kind of identification.<br> I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday<br> and I'll fill them in on things.<br> How is it back there?<br> I think you're homesick.<br> I'll be back on Thursday.<br> John, I want to tell you how much<br> I respect your dedication. Thank you.<br> Because I'm very bad, you know.<br> I have very wicked ideas.<br> As you're sitting at your desk you have<br> strange things running through your mind.<br> You should never be ashamed<br> of things like that.<br> Nothing is wrong.<br> Do you mind if I take my sweater off?<br> I like to sort of walk around here<br> with no clothes on.<br> I think people wear clothes much too often,<br> don't you?<br> I think in the confines of one's house,<br> one should be...<br> ... free of clothing and inhibitions.<br> I think the only way<br> that any of us can ever be happy...<br> ... is to let it all hang out.<br> You know, do it all and fuck it!<br> I was trying to get away from...<br> ...a world...<br> ...that I had known, because I don't think<br> it was very good for me, and...<br> ...I found myself...<br> ...Iooking up its ass...<br> ...and seeing people that I used to know...<br> ...and that I liked a lot...<br> ...that were my friends.<br> Sort of.<br> Girls...<br> ...and...<br> ...that could have been me.<br> I mean, I know I'm not stupid.<br> I guess I just realized...<br> ...that I don't really give a damn.<br> What I would really like to do<br> is be faceless and bodiless...<br> ... and be...<br> ... left alone.<br> You're lucky they're still here.<br> We don't keep unclaimed possessions<br> in suicide cases more than a year.<br> Number 497.<br> Jane McKenna.<br> I thought there would be more.<br> Well, there's this man, this detective...<br> ... and I don't know exactly what is...<br> ... happening or what he wants out of me,<br> or anything like that.<br> But he took care of me.<br> Did you feel threatened by it?<br> I don't know. When you're used<br> to being lonely and somebody comes in...<br> ... and moves that around,<br> it's sort of scary I guess.<br> How do you feel when you feel scared?<br> - Angry.<br> - At whom?<br> - Whoever is making me feel that way.<br> - Do you feel angry at him?<br> Half of the time, yes.<br> How do you feel angry?<br> What do you want to do?<br> I want to...<br> ... manipulate him.<br> How?<br> In all the ways<br> that I can manipulate people.<br> I mean, it's easy<br> to manipulate men. Right?<br> They were bringing<br> a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.<br> Propellers washed it up on top.<br> Arlyn Page was probably an alias.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Man, can you help me out?<br> Yes. What?<br> I mean, can you help me out?<br> I mean...<br> ...that's my baby, dead.<br> I have to get up.<br> - You know what it means, my baby dead.<br> - Got to get up.<br> Okay?<br> Lt. Trask, please. John Klute.<br> I think we should run down and check on<br> everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.<br> I don't think the man<br> who wrote the letters was Tom.<br> Just run down and check on everything.<br> Talk to you.<br> You're up, are you?<br> How are you?<br> Trask wants you to call him.<br> He told me about Arlyn.<br> It probably doesn't have anything<br> to do with anything...<br> ...but just as a precaution...<br> ...when you go out,<br> if you tell me where you're going to go...<br> ...a phone number where I can find you.<br> Just so I can always<br> keep in touch with you.<br> Okay?<br> Sure.<br> I'm all right.<br> I know.<br> I feel physically, that's what's different.<br> I mean, I feel. My body feels. I enjoy...<br> ...making love with him.<br> Which...<br> ...is a very baffling and bewildering thing,<br> because I've never felt that before.<br> I wish that I could let things happen and...<br> ...enjoy it, you know...<br> ...for what it is and while it lasts...<br> ...and relax about it.<br> But all the time,<br> I keep feeling the need to destroy it.<br> To break it off.<br> To...<br> ...go back to...<br> ...the comfort of being numb again.<br> I keep hoping, in a way,<br> that it's going to end.<br> Because...<br> ...I had more control before,<br> when I was with tricks.<br> I knew what I was doing<br> and I was setting everything up.<br> And that's what's so strange:<br> It's that I'm not setting anything up.<br> That...<br> ...something is...<br> You know what this is like,<br> but I've never felt it before.<br> It's a new thing and it's so strange.<br> The sensation that something...<br> ...that is flowing from me naturally<br> to somebody else...<br> ...without it's being prettied up or...<br> I mean, he's seen me horrible!<br> He's seen me ugly!<br> He's seen me...<br> ...mean. He's seen me whorey...<br> ...and it doesn't seem to matter.<br> He seems to accept me.<br> I guess...<br> ...having sex with somebody and feeling<br> those sort of feelings towards them...<br> ...is very new to me.<br> I wish that I didn't keep wanting<br> to destroy it.<br> You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.<br> Yes.<br> I'd love to party with you, but l...<br> Yes.<br> Marta, try to get somebody else...<br> ...and if I change my mind<br> I'll call you, okay?<br> You're not going to get hung up on me,<br> are you?<br> - Yes, sir, can I help you?<br> - Yes, can I have a bag please?<br> - Yes.<br> - A couple of bags please.<br> Well, let me see how much those weigh.<br> - A pound and a quarter.<br> - I'll have some of those small tomatoes.<br> - No mushy ones.<br> - Okay, thanks.<br> - What do you have in your bag?<br> - What?<br> What have you got in your bag?<br> Can I have a cantaloupe, please?<br> Wait.<br> He cut up my clothes...<br> Oh, my God!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Hello?<br> I can be a very bad girl, you know.<br> I sometimes need a spanking.<br> I have very wicked ideas.<br> I will do anything you ask.<br> You should never be ashamed<br> of things like that. You mustn't be.<br> You know, there's nothing wrong.<br> I think the only way<br> that any of us can ever be happy...<br> ... is to let it all hang out.<br> You know, do it all and fuck it!<br> The only responsibility you have to me<br> is to enjoy yourself.<br> She can't remember.<br> Well, it could have been...<br> ...it could have been hidden in his pocket,<br> I've seen one of those.<br> All right. I'll wait for you here.<br> Bree?<br> Trask and some officers are coming<br> to examine your apartment.<br> I want you to stay here today and...<br> ...tomorrow.<br> You'll be safe here.<br> I'll only be gone<br> for a few minutes tomorrow.<br> Bree?<br> Bree?<br> Well, you look like you've been<br> with many women, but I didn't know...<br> ... if you'd ever paid for a woman before.<br> I mean, you wouldn't need to.<br> So if you do, it's obviously<br> because it excites you.<br> Because you're not a man<br> that would have to pay for a woman.<br> You could have any woman you wanted.<br> The only responsibility you have to me<br> is to enjoy yourself.<br> I will do anything you ask or want.<br> Since you know that there are<br> no limits to my imagination.<br> I place no moral judgments on anything.<br> We checked out 42 letters<br> of Tom Grunemann's friends.<br> And we only came up with one<br> with any similarity to the obscene letter.<br> All right, there's Tom Grunemann.<br> Different margins, different spacings.<br> That's mine.<br> You said to check out everybody.<br> Same margins, top and sides.<br> He does best with his middle fingers.<br> We get fainter registrations<br> on outside keys.<br> Notice how he invariably does that<br> with the "T" and the "H."<br> Who is it?<br> Peter Cable.<br> But you have no case.<br> There's not even a body.<br> I'm sorry we have to meet here,<br> but I'm pretty rushed for time.<br> I have a business meeting<br> tonight in Chicago.<br> Any developments?<br> I think I can close the case.<br> I think I can close the case...<br> ...if I can have $500<br> to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.<br> I don't understand what you mean.<br> Well, I've found a contact<br> who will sell me the book.<br> A little black book containing the name<br> of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.<br> He is also the man<br> who came into Bree Daniel's...<br> ...apartment yesterday and wrecked it.<br> We know that now because<br> of the semen that he left in her underwear.<br> The blood type is AB,<br> and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.<br> I think this man killed Jane McKenna<br> and Arlyn Page. I think he drowned them.<br> I you should prepare yourself<br> for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.<br> The only way I'll find out is to find him.<br> I need the money before tomorrow night.<br> - You're meeting him tomorrow night?<br> - Yes.<br> - He's bringing the book to my apartment.<br> - At what time?<br> I'll notify the board<br> as soon as I get to Chicago...<br> ...and have them wire you<br> the money immediately.<br> Thank you, John.<br> I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Good luck.<br> I don't want you to do this.<br> Bree.<br> I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.<br> I can't stay here, obviously.<br> Please.<br> Not with him.<br> This other girl has a very big apartment,<br> lots of room.<br> But it's not necessarily how it looks.<br> Look...<br> ...we all respect each other, right?<br> I respect you.<br> Bree respects you.<br> But you have to respect her, too.<br> Her best interests.<br> Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.<br> Leave your name and number<br> with the service and she'll get back to you.<br> I can't.<br> Well, I have to close up now.<br> I almost killed somebody.<br> Well, I'm certain the doctor would like<br> to speak with you about it.<br> As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you<br> as soon as she gets home. I promise.<br> - Can I use your phone?<br> - Sure.<br> Is Mr. Goldfarb there? Mr. Goldfarb Sr.<br> I have to talk to somebody.<br> I'm just a little way across town.<br> Can I come over?<br> About half an hour?<br> Detective Trask, please.<br> Hi, John Klute.<br> He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.<br> I'm at home in my apartment.<br> I don't know where she is. I'll find her.<br> Okay. I'll leave word if I go out.<br> Okay.<br> I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.<br> Mr. Goldfarb!<br> Mr. Goldfarb!<br> Hello. What can I do for you?<br> I'm sorry. I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.<br> My father left about 15 minutes ago.<br> He didn't feel so good.<br> - Can I help you?<br> - He's working himself to death, poor man.<br> - You sure I can't help you?<br> - It's not important.<br> No, really. I don't mind.<br> You're going to miss your train,<br> Mr. Goldfarb.<br> Excuse me.<br> Did he leave a message for me?<br> Bree Daniel.<br> I thought that was for tomorrow!<br> Mr. Goldfarb's wire.<br> Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.<br> I know you don't like to get in<br> in the middle of the picture!<br> Yes, right away. Bye-bye.<br> We're closing now, Miss.<br> May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?<br> Poor man, everybody's friend.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> This is Bree Daniel.<br> Has the doctor checked in yet?<br> When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.<br> I'll wait five minutes.<br> How I can reach the doctor?<br> The doctor hasn't checked in yet.<br> I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.<br> I'm sorry sir,<br> but we only take messages for the doctor.<br> Has she called in or anything?<br> Has she called the doctor at all today?<br> - She left a forwarding number.<br> - Can I have that number, please?<br> I'm not allowed to give that out.<br> I'm a police officer.<br> Please don't make me prove this.<br> You must understand my position.<br> I must comply with the rules.<br> I understand all that.<br> Will you just give me the number, please?<br> Can we talk about this reasonably?<br> I know you're expecting some kind<br> of extravagant behavior but...<br> ...do you believe me?<br> Yes.<br> We can talk?<br> Well, it's just an ordinary matter.<br> I'm a very well-off man.<br> I have a position to respect...<br> ...I would feel personally,<br> very uncomfortable to be...<br> ...connected with...<br> ...a certain kind of woman.<br> I'm sure you understand what I mean.<br> Look, John Klute works for me.<br> I know you're his contact.<br> I know he's trying to acquire...<br> ...Jane McKenna's book.<br> I'm in a position<br> to offer more for it than he can.<br> You don't understand<br> what I'm talking about, do you?<br> Yes. Jane McKenna's book.<br> - And I'll try to get it for you.<br> - No.<br> Obviously you're frightened<br> and you're lying.<br> No, I'm not. I will, I'll try to get it for you.<br> Is this...<br> ...something Klute's invented.<br> Is this a trap for me?<br> - Klute knows about me, doesn't he?<br> - Knows what about you?<br> Then everybody knows about me.<br> So, it doesn't make any difference<br> what I do anymore, does it?<br> I've no idea what I'm going to do...<br> ...and I'm so deeply puzzled.<br> I've done terrible things.<br> I've killed three people.<br> And yet, I don't consider myself<br> a terrible man.<br> No more than others.<br> See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.<br> We were here on business together...<br> ...and he found me and Jane McKenna<br> in my hotel room.<br> She had become hysterical<br> and she started...<br> ...screaming...<br> ...and I guess I hit her.<br> I don't actually recall<br> how it all happened so quickly.<br> Anyway, she fell and hit her head,<br> and that's when Tom...<br> ...came in the room.<br> I guess he must've heard her screaming.<br> But I never understood...<br> ...why she did that.<br> She had never screamed before.<br> It was the...<br> ...revulsion and the...<br> ...contempt that I saw on his face...<br> ...and the certainty that sooner or later<br> he would use it against me...<br> ...within the company.<br> I tried to endure that<br> as long as I possibly could.<br> You just want me to keep on talking,<br> don't you?<br> No, I don't. I do understand. I really do.<br> Well, that's what you all do.<br> You make a man think that he's accepted.<br> It's all just a great big game to you.<br> You're all obviously too lazy and<br> too warped to do anything meaningful...<br> ...with your life, so you...<br> ...prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.<br> I'm sure it comes as no great surprise<br> to you when I say that...<br> ...there are...<br> ...little corners in everyone...<br> ...which were better off left alone.<br> Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which...<br> ...should never be exposed.<br> That's your stock in trade, isn't it,<br> a man's weakness?<br> I was never really fully aware of mine...<br> ...until you brought them out.<br> How far out of town are we?<br> - Five miles outside of New York.<br> - Do you mind if I turn...<br> ... the lights down?<br> No, it's up to you.<br> Turn the light out if you'd like.<br> My name is Peter Cable.<br> I work for the Tole American Corporation...<br> ... which is situated in Pennsylvania<br> and in New York.<br> I would not be telling you these things...<br> ... if my intentions weren't honorable.<br> - You look familiar to me.<br> - In what way?<br> I don't know.<br> Your face looks familiar to me.<br> I guess I have a confession to make.<br> We did meet before. About two years ago.<br> I often wondered<br> whatever happened to Arlyn Page...<br> ... and here you are.<br> Yeah, I remember.<br> Listen...<br> ... l've got get out of here. I mean I can't...<br> I remember you.<br> - Well, what do you remember?<br> - You beat me up, that's what you did!<br> It's okay.<br> Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.<br> I promise to drive you back afterwards.<br> Okay.<br> Why don't you just tell me<br> what you'd like, and then...<br> - ... after you tell me what you'd like...<br> - I'd like to spend some time with you.<br> - I have been looking for you for two years.<br> - Why?<br> That's my business.<br> I will say that you gave me<br> a great deal of pleasure.<br> I saw in you things that I had not seen<br> in other women of your profession.<br> I will not harm you at all physically.<br> It's all right.<br> No, it's not all right,<br> and you know it's not all right.<br> No, it is all right. If that's what you...<br> But, you have to tell me first.<br> If that's what you want...<br> - ... that's fine.<br> - Arlyn...<br> ... why don't you lie down on the bed<br> and make yourself comfortable.<br> I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.<br> Just lie down on the bed, please.<br> Be comfortable.<br> Nothing's going to happen.<br> Nothing's going to happen.<br> Okay.<br> - Why don't you make yourself comfortable?<br> - I am perfectly comfortable.<br> Just put your head down.<br> You have such lovely long blonde hair.<br> Turn your head.<br> Like that.<br> Don't!<br> Don't!<br> I've explained to him what I have to do...<br> ... and I think he understands.<br> What could ever happen for us?<br> I mean, we're so different.<br> I know enough about myself<br> to know that whatever...<br> ... lies in store for me it's not going to be...<br> ... setting up housekeeping<br> with somebody in Tuscarora...<br> ... and darning socks and doing all that.<br> I'd go out of my mind.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.<br> It's so hard for me to say it! God!<br> - To say what?<br> - I'm going to miss him.<br> Bree Daniel.<br> How is Roy?<br> Well, I'm leaving town right now<br> and I don't expect to be back.<br> You're very nice.<br> Thank you. Goodbye.<br> I have no idea what's going to happen.<br> I just can't stay in the city, you know?<br> Maybe I'll come back.<br> You'll probably see me next week.<br>
