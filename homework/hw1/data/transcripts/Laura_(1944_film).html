                        I shall never forget<br> the weekend Laura died.<br> A silver sun burned through the sky<br> like a huge magnifying glass.<br> It was the hottest Sunday<br> in my recollection.<br> I felt as if I were the only human being<br> left in New York.<br> For with Laura's<br> horrible death, I was alone.<br> I, Waldo Lydecker...<br> was the only one<br> who really knew her...<br> and I had just begun<br> to write Laura's story when...<br> another of those detectives<br> came to see me.<br> I had him wait.<br> I could watch him<br> through the half-open door.<br> I noted that his attention<br> was fixed upon my clock.<br> There was only one other<br> in existence...<br> and that was<br> in Laura's apartment...<br> in the very room<br> where she was murdered.<br> Careful there.<br> That stuff is priceless.<br> Come in here, please.<br> Mr. Lydecker?<br> Ah, you recognize me.<br> How splendid.<br> Sit down, please.<br> Nice little place<br> you have here, Mr. Lydecker.<br> It's lavish,<br> but I call it home.<br> I suppose you're here<br> about the Laura Hunt murder.<br> Yesterday morning,<br> after Laura's body was found...<br> I was questioned<br> by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz...<br> and I stated...<br> "On Friday night, Laura had a dinner<br> engagement with me...<br> "after which she was ostensibly<br> going out of town.<br> "She phoned and canceled<br> our engagement at exactly 7:00.<br> - After that I...''<br> - You "ate a lonely dinner...<br> then got into the tub to read.''<br> Why did you<br> write it down?<br> Afraid you'd forget it?<br> I am the most widely<br> misquoted man in America.<br> When my friends do it,<br> I resent it.<br> From Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,<br> I should find it intolerable.<br> Hand me that washcloth,<br> please, Mr....<br> Mr....<br> McPherson.<br> McPherson. McPherson.<br> Mark McPherson-<br> the siege of Babylon, Long Island.<br> The gangster with the machine gun.<br> Killed three policemen.<br> I told the story over the air<br> and wrote a column about it.<br> Are you the one<br> with the leg full of lead...<br> - the man who walked right in and got him?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, well.<br> Hand me my robe, please.<br> You have a pretty good memory,<br> Mr. Lydecker.<br> I always liked that detective<br> with the silver shinbone.<br> Thanks. I hope you won't have any reason<br> to change your mind about me.<br> - Have you any more questions?<br> - Yeah, just one.<br> Two years ago,<br> in your October 17 column...<br> you started out<br> to write a book review...<br> but at the bottom of the column, you<br> switched over to the Harrington murder case.<br> Are the processes of the creative mind<br> now under the jurisdiction of the police?<br> You said Harrington was rubbed out with<br> a shotgun loaded with buckshot...<br> the way Laura Hunt was murdered<br> night before last.<br> - Did I?<br> - Yeah.<br> But he was really killed<br> with a sash weight.<br> How ordinary.<br> My version was obviously superior.<br> I never bother<br> with details, you know.<br> I do. Well, so long.<br> Mind if I go with you?<br> - What for?<br> - Murder is my favorite crime.<br> I write about it regularly...<br> and I know you'll have to visit everyone<br> on your list of suspects.<br> I'd like to study<br> their reactions.<br> - You're on the list yourself, you know.<br> - Good.<br> To have overlooked me<br> would have been a pointed insult.<br> You're not the sort of man<br> one would insult, Mr. Lydecker.<br> - Do you really suspect me?<br> - Yes.<br> McPherson, if you know anything<br> about faces, look at mine.<br> How singularly innocent<br> I look this morning.<br> Have you ever seen<br> such candid eyes?<br> Something you confiscated<br> in a raid on a kindergarten?<br> Takes a lot of control.<br> Would you like to try it?<br> No, thanks.<br> Were you in love<br> with Laura Hunt, Mr. Lydecker?<br> Was she in love with you?<br> Laura considered me<br> the wisest, the wittiest...<br> the most interesting man<br> she'd ever met.<br> I was in complete accord<br> with her on that point.<br> She thought me also<br> the kindest...<br> the gentlest...<br> the most sympathetic man<br> in the world.<br> Did you agree<br> with her there too?<br> McPherson,<br> you won't understand this...<br> but I tried to become<br> the kindest, the gentlest...<br> the most sympathetic man<br> in the world.<br> Have any luck?<br> Let me put it this way.<br> I should be sincerely sorry to see my<br> neighbors' children devoured by wolves.<br> Shall we go?<br> - Good morning, Lieutenant.<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Treadwell.<br> - Waldo.<br> - Good morning, Ann.<br> - I've just taken over the Laura Hunt case.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> Thanks. I have<br> all the reports...<br> but there are a few more questions<br> I'd like to ask.<br> Certainly. I'll do anything<br> I can to help.<br> You were fond of your niece,<br> Mrs. Treadwell?<br> Why, I adored her.<br> Cigarette?<br> No, thanks. You collapsed when<br> you identified the body.<br> I can quite understand that. A shotgun<br> loaded with buckshot, close range.<br> - It's not very nice to look at.<br> - It was horrible.<br> Her maid Bessie, I suppose<br> she was devoted to Miss Hunt?<br> Oh, she worshipped her.<br> Laura had had her for years.<br> I'll never forget her scream<br> when she saw Laura lying there.<br> Did you approve of Miss Hunt's coming<br> marriage to Mr. Carpenter?<br> Why? Shouldn't I approve?<br> I don't know. What is your relationship<br> with Mr. Carpenter?<br> What do you mean?<br> What I mean is, he's been<br> a frequent guest in your home.<br> Is he an acquaintance? Friend?<br> Are you in love with him?<br> This is beginning to assume<br> fabulous aspects.<br> Oh, shut up, Waldo!<br> What are you driving at?<br> The truth, Mrs. Treadwell.<br> Are you in love with him?<br> Why, no. I'm- I'm very fond<br> of Mr. Carpenter, of course.<br> - Everybody is.<br> - I'm not. I'll be hanged if I am.<br> Oh, don't be<br> so annoying, Waldo!<br> Did you give<br> Mr. Carpenter money?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - A couple of checks went through your account endorsed by him.<br> One on May 15 for $250.<br> One on May 22 for $400.<br> Oh, that. I-<br> I asked him to do<br> some shopping for me. That's all.<br> Shelby's a very obliging fellow.<br> For some time, also, you've been<br> withdrawing various amounts in cash.<br> Sometimes 1,500.<br> Sometimes 1,700 at a clip.<br> Yes. I needed that money.<br> The day you took out $1,500,<br> Mr. Carpenter deposited 1,350.<br> When you withdrew 1,700,<br> he deposited 1,550.<br> Maybe they were shooting crap.<br> Oh, must I be insulted like this?<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Treadwell, but I have<br> to find out about these things.<br> Shelby needed some money, and I lent it to<br> him. That's all. After all, it is my money.<br> - I suppose I can do as I please with it.<br> - Sure. Of course.<br> Now, on Friday night, Mrs. Treadwell,<br> you stayed home alone all evening?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why didn't you go to the concert with Shelby?<br> Because he didn't ask me.<br> We were just talking<br> about you, Carpenter.<br> - What a coincidence to find you here.<br> - This is Lieutenant McPherson.<br> - Oh, how do you do, Lieutenant?<br> - I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I was just lying down here.<br> My hotel room was so hot, and then all<br> the people and reporters and telephone.<br> You know how it is,<br> Lieutenant.<br> I've hardly slept a wink<br> since it happened.<br> Is that a sign of guilt or innocence,<br> McPherson?<br> I'm at your disposal, Lieutenant. I'm as<br> eager to find the murderer as you are.<br> But what possible motive<br> could I have for killing Laura?<br> Miss Hunt and I were going to be married<br> this week, you know.<br> No, he doesn't know,<br> and neither do I...<br> - or you or anyone else alive.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> Laura had not definitely made up<br> her mind to marry him.<br> She told me so herself last Friday when she<br> called up to cancel our dinner engagement.<br> As a matter of fact, she was going<br> to the country to think it over.<br> She was extremely kind,<br> but I was always sure...<br> she would never have thrown her life<br> away on a male beauty in distress.<br> I suppose you've heard<br> losers whine before...<br> especially in your<br> profession, eh?<br> Would you like<br> a bite of lunch, Lieutenant?<br> That's very thoughtful-<br> the perfect host.<br> - Waldo.<br> - You'd almost think he was in his own home.<br> Shelby knows how distracted I am.<br> Would you, Lieutenant?<br> Thank you, Mrs. Treadwell,<br> but I've got to be going.<br> But, Lieutenant, I- Well, I rather thought<br> you'd want to ask me some questions.<br> Oh, yes. What did they play<br> at the concert Friday night?<br> Oh, Brahms's First<br> and Beethoven's Ninth.<br> Uh-huh. Have you got a key<br> to Miss Hunt's house up in the country?<br> No, but I think there's one<br> up in her apartment.<br> - Okay, I'll have a look.<br> - Perhaps I could help you?<br> All right. Come along.<br> I'll be seeing you,<br> Mrs. Treadwell.<br> Extra.! Extra.!<br> Girl victim in brutal slaying.!<br> Extra.! Girl victim<br> in brutal slaying.!<br> Read all about it.!<br> Girl victim in brutal slaying.!<br> Girl victim<br> in brutal slaying.! Read all about it.!<br> All right.<br> Break it up. Break it up.<br> Ice-cold drinks.!<br> - The doorbell rang.<br> - What?<br> As she opened the door,<br> the shot was fired.<br> And how do you deduce that?<br> She fell backward.<br> The body was there.<br> I thought you hadn't<br> been up here before.<br> I saw the police photos.<br> I guess I better<br> try and find that key.<br> McPherson, tell me, why did they have to<br> photograph her in that horrible condition?<br> When a dame gets killed,<br> she doesn't worry about how she looks.<br> Will you stop calling her a dame?<br> Look around.<br> Is this the home of a dame?<br> Look at her.<br> Not bad.<br> Jacoby was in love with her<br> when he painted it...<br> but he never captured<br> her vibrance, her warmth.<br> Have you ever been in love?<br> A doll in Washington Heights<br> once got a fox fur out of me.<br> Ever know a woman who wasn't<br> a "doll'' or a "dame''?<br> Yeah, one, but she kept walking me<br> past furniture windows...<br> to look at the parlor suites.<br> - Would you mind turning that off?<br> - Why? Don't you like it?<br> It was one of Laura's favorites.<br> Not exactly classical, but sweet.<br> - You know a lot about music?<br> - I don't know a lot about anything...<br> but I know a little<br> about practically everything.<br> Yeah? Then why did you say...<br> they played Brahms's First and Beethoven's<br> Ninth at the concert Friday night?<br> They changed the program at the last<br> minute and played nothing but Sibelius.<br> I suppose I should have<br> told you in the first place.<br> I'd been working on that<br> advertising campaign with Laura.<br> Well, we'd been working so hard, I-<br> I just couldn't keep my eyes open.<br> I didn't hear a note at the concert.<br> I fell asleep.<br> Next he'll produce<br> photographic evidence of his dreams.<br> I know it sounds suspicious,<br> but I'm resigned to that by now.<br> I'm a natural-born suspect just because<br> I'm not the conventional type.<br> I wouldn't worry about it,<br> Mr. Carpenter.<br> It sounds reasonable.<br> I fall asleep at concerts myself.<br> Thank you.<br> You found<br> that key yet?<br> No. I looked for it in the den,<br> but it wasn't there. It may be in here.<br> Yes, here it is.<br> I knew there must be<br> one around somewhere.<br> The police are very fussy<br> about their inventories.<br> That key isn't on the list of things<br> that were in that drawer yesterday.<br> Then it's made<br> a recent reappearance.<br> You put it there,<br> didn't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> It's just that I didn't want to give it<br> to you while Waldo was present.<br> - Oh.<br> - I have private reasons that don't concern him.<br> Everything about Laura<br> concerns me.<br> You have private reasons,<br> no doubt, to lie about the key.<br> Waldo, for your own good,<br> I'm warning you to stop implying...<br> that I had anything to do<br> with Laura's death.<br> Very well.<br> I'll stop implying.<br> I'll make<br> a direct statement.<br> All right,<br> you asked for it.<br> I wouldn't.<br> Will you please stop dawdling<br> with that infernal puzzle?<br> - It's getting on my nerves.<br> - I know, but it keeps me calm.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> This was our table-<br> Laura's and mine.<br> We spent many quiet evenings<br> here together.<br> I remember we dined here the night<br> before her 22nd birthday.<br> Just we two-<br> happy, making plans<br> for her future.<br> - Good luck.<br> But this was a far cry...<br> from the girl who walked into my life<br> at the Algonquin Hotel five years before.<br> Pardon me.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me.<br> Mr. Lydecker,<br> how do you do?<br> My name is Laura Hunt,<br> and I'm with Bullitt and Company.<br> You know,<br> the big advertising firm.<br> And I'd like to talk<br> something over with you, if I may.<br> You can hardly fail to realize that<br> I am engaged in eating my lunch.<br> Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorry<br> to interrupt this way...<br> but it's so hard to get to see you<br> the regular way, and...<br> this will only<br> take a minute, really.<br> - Now, this is-<br> - Young woman...<br> either you have been raised<br> in some incredibly rustic community...<br> where good manners<br> are unknown...<br> or you suffer from the common<br> feminine delusion...<br> that the mere fact<br> of being a woman...<br> exempts you from the rules<br> of civilized conduct.<br> Or possibly both.<br> Possibly, but here's<br> what I wanted to show you.<br> It's for<br> the Wallace Flow-Rite pen.<br> I know my company would be glad to pay<br> you $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.<br> I don't use a pen.<br> I write with a goose quill<br> dipped in venom.<br> Yes, but this is a very fine pen,<br> Mr. Lydecker...<br> the best on the market.<br> Wouldn't you at least<br> consider endorsing it?<br> I'll neither consider, endorse<br> or use the Wallace pen.<br> I hate pens.<br> If your employers wish me to publish<br> that statement in my column...<br> you may tell them that I shall be<br> delighted to oblige.<br> Oh, no.<br> You mustn't do that.<br> Don't blame Bullitt and Company,<br> Mr. Lydecker.<br> They don't know anything about this.<br> It was my idea to see you.<br> Indeed?<br> Yes. I know they'd give anything down<br> at the office to get your endorsement...<br> only they think<br> there's no use asking.<br> So I had this ad made up<br> all on my own...<br> because I thought, well,<br> what's the harm in trying?<br> There was always a chance<br> that you might, Mr. Lydecker.<br> Just think what<br> it would mean-<br> You seem to be completely disregarding<br> something more important than your career.<br> - What?<br> - My lunch.<br> Do you really believe that?<br> Implicitly.<br> I never heard<br> of anything so selfish.<br> In my case, self-absorption<br> is completely justified.<br> I have never discovered any other<br> subject quite so worthy of my attention.<br> But you write about people...<br> with such real understanding<br> and sentiment.<br> That's what makes<br> your column so good.<br> Sentiment comes easily<br> at 50 cents a word.<br> Well, if that's the way<br> you really feel...<br> you must be very lonely.<br> Will you kindly continue<br> this character analysis elsewhere?<br> - You begin to bore me.<br> - You're a poor man.<br> I'm very sorry for you.<br> Naturally,<br> I was annoyed by the incident...<br> but she had something<br> about her, that girl.<br> I had to speak to her again.<br> I had to see her.<br> - Miss, would you mind if I-<br> - Just a moment, please.<br> I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.<br> He's on the telephone.<br> Thank you.<br> Boy, Waldo Lydecker<br> to see Miss Laura Hunt.<br> Announce me.<br> Johnny, please tell<br> the gentleman I'm busy.<br> Miss Hunt, I have something<br> to say to you.<br> You've already said it,<br> Mr. Lydecker.<br> I wish to point out that you caught me<br> at my most difficult moment.<br> Ordinarily I am not<br> without a heart.<br> Really?<br> Shall I produce<br> X- ray pictures to prove it?<br> I wish to apologize.<br> Your apology is accepted.<br> Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.<br> If you come<br> a little bit closer, my boy...<br> I can just crack your skull<br> with my stick.<br> And now, for reasons<br> which are too embarrassing to mention...<br> I'd like to endorse that pen.<br> Mr. Lydecker!<br> Thank you.<br> - You're a very strange man.<br> - What?<br> You're really sorry<br> for the way you acted, aren't you?<br> Let's not be psychiatric,<br> Miss Hunt...<br> but in a word, yes.<br> It's very kind of you,<br> you know.<br> I'm not kind. I'm vicious.<br> It's the secret of my charm.<br> But if you choose<br> to think me kind...<br> I'll call for you at 6:00.<br> All right?<br> All right.<br> Her career began<br> with my endorsement of the pen.<br> I secured other endorsements for her...<br> introduced her<br> to important clients.<br> I gave her her start...<br> but it was her own talent<br> and imagination...<br> that enabled her to rise<br> to the top of her profession...<br> and stay there.<br> She had an eager mind always.<br> She was always quick to seize upon<br> anything that would improve her mind...<br> or her appearance.<br> Laura had innate breeding.<br> But she deferred<br> to my judgment and taste.<br> I selected a more attractive<br> hair dress for her.<br> I taught her what clothes<br> were more becoming to her.<br> Through me, she met everyone.<br> The famous and the infamous.<br> Her youth and beauty, her poise<br> and charm of manner...<br> captivated them all.<br> She had warmth, vitality.<br> She had authentic magnetism.<br> Wherever we went,<br> she stood out.<br> Men admired her.<br> Women envied her.<br> She became as well known<br> as Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...<br> and his white carnation.<br> But Tuesday and Friday nights<br> we stayed home...<br> dining quietly,<br> listening to my records.<br> I read my articles to her.<br> The way she listened<br> was more eloquent than speech.<br> These were the best nights.<br> Then one Tuesday, she phoned<br> and said she couldn't come.<br> It didn't matter, really.<br> But when it happened again<br> the following Friday, I was disturbed.<br> I couldn't<br> understand it. I felt betrayed...<br> and yet I knew Laura<br> would never betray anyone.<br> I walked for a long time.<br> Then I found myself<br> before her apartment building.<br> The lights were on.<br> It pleased me to know she was home...<br> till I saw she was not alone.<br> But I waited.<br> I wanted to see who he was.<br> It was Jacoby, who had recently<br> painted her portrait.<br> I never liked the man.<br> He was so obviously conscious of looking<br> more like an athlete than an artist.<br> I sat up the rest of the night<br> writing a column about him.<br> I demolished his affectations...<br> exposed his camouflaged<br> imitations of better painters...<br> ridiculed his theories.<br> I did it for her,<br> knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.<br> It was a masterpiece<br> because it was a labor of love.<br> Naturally, she could never<br> regard him seriously again.<br> There were others,<br> of course...<br> but her own discrimination<br> ruled them out...<br> before it became necessary<br> for me to intercede...<br> until one night at a party<br> at Ann Treadwell's.<br> It was one of her usual roundups<br> of bizarre and nondescript characters...<br> - corralled from every stratum of society.<br> - How are you this evening?<br> This is Mr. and Mrs. Preston.<br> They've been waiting to meet you.<br> How do you do?<br> - Hello, Shelby.<br> - Excuse me, honey.<br> You're Laura Hunt.<br> - Yes?<br> - Hello. I'm Shelby Carpenter.<br> - Want to dance?<br> - I'm not alone.<br> Oh, him? I'll bet<br> he's still doing the polka.<br> Excuse me, please. Yes.<br> Betsy Ross taught it to me.<br> - Hello, Waldo. Darling, how are you?<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - I see you've met Shelby.<br> - Hello, Ann.<br> - Unavoidably.<br> - He was awfully nice to me in Louisville at the Derby.<br> His family's from Kentucky.<br> Sharecroppers, no doubt.<br> Louise. Louise, for the last time,<br> will you marry me?<br> I won't, but I've saved<br> some chicken livers for you.<br> Oh, you're an angel.<br> In the meantime, darling...<br> you think you could<br> get this spot out for me?<br> I can afford a blemish on my character<br> but not on my clothes.<br> - Mmm. Couldn't eat another mouthful.<br> - I'm afraid it's rouge.<br> - I'm afraid it's liquor.<br> - Louise. Oh.<br> - May I have a glass of milk for Mr. Lydecker?<br> - Of course, Miss Hunt.<br> I forgot to tell you.<br> I also read palms.<br> I cook, I swallow swords, I mend my own<br> socks, I never eat garlic or onions.<br> What more can you want<br> of a man?<br> - Don't listen to that scalawag.<br> - I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.<br> What do you mean?<br> We're old friends.<br> She feeds me,<br> humors me, repairs me...<br> and refuses to marry me,<br> don't you, honey?<br> - I do.<br> - She has good sense.<br> - Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.<br> - You're wasting your time.<br> - She's got good sense too.<br> - You're jealous.<br> And what does it feel like,<br> Mr. Carpenter?<br> What does what feel like,<br> Miss Hunt?<br> Living on the income<br> from an estate.<br> - Well, I, uh-<br> - Or don't you know?<br> Well, I did, until the sheriff<br> took it over 10 years ago.<br> Why maintain the fiction?<br> Why not work?<br> Believe it or not, I asked<br> one of my many friends for a job once-<br> executive of a big company-<br> He could have pressed a button<br> and done it, but he just laughed.<br> - He thought I was joking.<br> - Weren't you?<br> No. When I convinced him, he got<br> embarrassed, said he'd phone me.<br> That was months ago. Now whenever<br> he sees me, he looks the other way.<br> - Do you really want a job?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, here you are.<br> Laura, dear, I cannot stand<br> these morons any longer.<br> If you don't come with me<br> this instant, I shall run amok.<br> All right, Waldo.<br> Bullitt and Company.<br> You've got a job.<br> I concealed my<br> annoyance with masterly self-control...<br> but I sensed a situation<br> which would bear watching.<br> Laura, take a look at this.<br> Do you like it? Do you think it'll make<br> people want to bathe more often?<br> It should. It's excellent.<br> - There you are.<br> - Good night, Miss Hunt.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Mr. Carpenter.<br> - Good night, honey.<br> - It's really very good. Who's the model?<br> A girl named Diane Redfern.<br> You hired her yourself last week.<br> - Don't you remember?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Well, let's go, moon of my delight.<br> I am starved.<br> You usually are.<br> - I approve of that hat.<br> - You do?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> And the girl in it too.<br> Thank you.<br> I knew there was<br> something on my mind.<br> What is it? Oh, yes.<br> Will you dine with me tomorrow night?<br> - Maybe.<br> - No, that isn't what's worrying me.<br> - It's the next night.<br> - But, Shelby, I can't be-<br> Good. What about three weeks from<br> tonight and all the nights in between?<br> Don't you think<br> I have any other engagements?<br> What about two months<br> from now and the month after that?<br> - What about next year?<br> - That's all settled. What about breakfast?<br> What about dancing?<br> What about lunch?<br> Beautiful lunches...<br> - day after day after day after day?<br> - What about work?<br> Beautiful work,<br> day after day after day?<br> Why, Miss Hunt,<br> the way you talk.<br> You'd think I was<br> in love with you.<br> Yes, Laura,<br> I heard everything he said.<br> I went to call for you.<br> I'm sorry, Waldo.<br> And that reminds me.<br> Old Mother Hubbard has<br> something in the cupboard.<br> The results of<br> my private investigation...<br> of that sterling character,<br> Mr. Shelby Carpenter.<br> By stooping so low, you only<br> degrade yourself, Waldo.<br> Did you know that he almost went to jail<br> for passing rubber checks...<br> that he was suspected of stealing<br> his hostess's jewels...<br> when he was a houseguest<br> in Virginia?<br> Naturally they'd suspect him,<br> because he isn't rich.<br> Those are only insinuations...<br> the cheapest kind.<br> These aren't only<br> insinuations, my dear.<br> There you are.<br> Read them.<br> What of it?<br> I know his faults.<br> A man can change, can't he?<br> People are always ready<br> to hold out a hand to slap you down...<br> but never to pick you up.<br> All right,<br> I'm helping Shelby.<br> His past is his own affair.<br> I only care about the present.<br> Speaking of the changed Mr. Carpenter<br> in the present tense...<br> he's now running around<br> with a model from your own office.<br> Her name is Diane Redfern.<br> I'm closer to despising you<br> than I thought I ever would be.<br> I'm sorry. I should have<br> told you before.<br> Shelby and I are going to be<br> married next week.<br> I believe you presented him with<br> a cigarette case on his last birthday.<br> Rather valuable, isn't it?<br> Where did you get it?<br> From the pawnshop where Diane Redfern<br> took it after he gave it to her.<br> I don't believe it. He probably needed<br> money and was too proud to borrow.<br> Carpenter proud?<br> Perhaps that's why<br> the pawn ticket was in her name.<br> Before this goes any further,<br> why, I'll just-<br> He isn't home.<br> He's dining<br> at Ann Treadwell's.<br> He can't be.<br> He asked me to dinner.<br> He would have canceled his appointment<br> with her if you had accepted.<br> He treats her<br> rather badly these days.<br> I'm afraid she'll say<br> he isn't there.<br> Waldo...<br> why are you doing this?<br> For you, Laura.<br> Shall we pay them a visit?<br> He won't be there, Waldo.<br> I know he won't.<br> All right. We'll see.<br> Don't you want to take this little<br> bauble along in case he is there?<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - I'm sorry. Mrs. Treadwell is not home.<br> - We know, dear.<br> Good evening.<br> Hello, darling. I didn't expect<br> to see you tonight.<br> There you are, my dear.<br> In a moment of supreme disaster,<br> he's trite.<br> You've been reading<br> too many melodramas, Waldo.<br> I was just telling Ann<br> about our getting married.<br> Well, have you two<br> had dinner?<br> Would you like<br> a glass of wine?<br> Why don't you sit down?<br> I couldn't find out<br> if she saw Carpenter in the meantime.<br> All I know is that on Friday<br> she had lunch with Diane Redfern.<br> What came of it,<br> I hoped to hear that night.<br> - I alternated between moods of<br> over optimism and over pessimism.<br> When the phone rang,<br> I had a foreboding of disaster.<br> I called to tell you, Waldo,<br> I'm frightfully sorry.<br> I can't have dinner<br> with you tonight.<br> Oh, no, no. I'm not sick.<br> I'm just dreadfully nervous.<br> I'm going to the country<br> for a few days.<br> Yes. I'm afraid<br> it's about Shelby.<br> Oh, no. Please.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> I've got to think<br> this thing out for myself.<br> I'm sorry. I'll call you<br> when I get back. Good-bye.<br> It was the last time<br> I ever heard her voice.<br> I was sure she had<br> too much pride to forgive him.<br> But-<br> Where does<br> this Diane Redfern live?<br> Brooklyn somewhere.<br> She's in the phone book.<br> Come on. It's late.<br> Let's get going.<br> - Waiter.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All right.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Lydecker.<br> Good night.<br> I shall never forgive myself for<br> letting her become involved with Shelby.<br> It was my fault.<br> I should have<br> stopped it somehow.<br> Well, it's too late now.<br> Thanks for the wine.<br> Hello. Mosconi's?<br> This is Lieutenant McPherson,<br> Homicide Bureau.<br> Laura Hunt had been buying her liquor<br> from you for several years, hadn't she?<br> Yeah.<br> Did she ever buy a brand of scotch<br> called Black Pony?<br> Yeah.<br> I see.<br> Well, that's all<br> I wanted to know. Thanks.<br> She's here, McPherson-<br> the maid.<br> Okay.<br> - Come in, Miss Clary.<br> - Never mind the "Miss Clary'' stuff.<br> My name's Bessie, and I'm a domestic,<br> and I got nothin' to be ashamed of.<br> Sit down, Bessie.<br> Her letters.<br> And her private diary.<br> You've been reading them,<br> pawing over them.<br> It's a shame in the face of the dead.<br> That's what it is. It's a shame.<br> - Sit down, Bessie.<br> - I'll stand on my own two feet.<br> Don't you go<br> ordering me around.<br> I ain't afraid of cops. I was<br> brought up to spit whenever I saw one.<br> Okay, go ahead and spit<br> if that'll make you feel better.<br> What do you want to know?<br> What we all want to know-<br> who killed Laura Hunt.<br> How would I know?<br> You don't think I done it?<br> I know you cops<br> get crazy notions...<br> but if you got any notion<br> concerning me-<br> Ask anyone-<br> anyone who ever come to this house.<br> I would have<br> worked for her.<br> I would have washed,<br> ironed, scrubbed...<br> done everything she wanted of me,<br> whether she paid me for it or not.<br> And it wasn't only on account of the<br> thousand sweet things she done for me.<br> It was because she was<br> so sweet herself...<br> because she was<br> a real fine lady.<br> But you cops<br> wouldn't know about that.<br> But you do. That's all the more reason<br> why you should help me, Bessie.<br> Do you happen to know how this got into<br> her liquor cabinet?<br> I put it there.<br> But she never bought cheap stuff like<br> that- not a lady like Miss Hunt.<br> - No.<br> - When did you put it in the cabinet?<br> - Saturday.<br> - Before the police came.<br> - Was it there Friday night before you left?<br> - No.<br> Are you sure of that?<br> I cleaned out<br> the cabinet on Friday...<br> and put the empties<br> in the basement.<br> Then somebody was with her<br> in the apartment Friday night...<br> someone<br> who brought that bottle.<br> - Yes.<br> - Who?<br> I don't know,<br> but I didn't want anyone...<br> getting any wrong ideas about her,<br> God rest her soul.<br> That's why I took it out of the bedroom<br> and put it in the cabinet...<br> before the police got here.<br> And that ain't all I done.<br> I washed out the glasses<br> and cleaned off the bottle too.<br> Do you know what happens to people<br> who destroy evidence?<br> I don't care.<br> You ain't gonna tell<br> the newspaper reporters, are ya...<br> and let them make up<br> their nasty stories...<br> and drag her name<br> through the mud?<br> Go ahead,<br> but it won't do you any good.<br> - I'll say you lied. I'll say-<br> - Take it easy, Bessie.<br> Get me some ice<br> and a setup, will you?<br> All right.<br> A couple of highball glasses.<br> Good morning.<br> Lieutenant McPherson sent for us.<br> - Good morning, Lieutenant.<br> - Hello, McPherson.<br> - This is quite a delegation. I only sent for you, Carpenter.<br> - I know.<br> Shelby's dropping me off<br> at the hairdresser's later...<br> - so I thought I might as well come along.<br> - My excuse is equally feeble.<br> I just popped in<br> to pay my dubious respects...<br> and inquire as to<br> the state of your health.<br> - Insipid, I trust.<br> - I was just going to pour myself a drink.<br> - Care to join me?<br> - A very nice idea. Shelby, wouldn't you like one?<br> - I'll get it.<br> - Never mind.<br> - Bessie, would you bring a couple more glasses?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hi, Bessie.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I'm paid up for the week,<br> and I'm working, regardless.<br> - Would you like one, Lydecker?<br> - I see no reason to exclude myself...<br> if the host provides scotch.<br> - This do?<br> - I presume it'll have to.<br> How about you, Carpenter?<br> It's cheap, but it's potent.<br> As a matter of fact, I don't think I care<br> for any. I'm not much of a daytime drinker.<br> - Uh-huh. That'll be all for you, Bessie.<br> You can go home now. - But I- Yes, sir.<br> I remember when Laura<br> bought these glasses.<br> She loved them.<br> She loved all her things so.<br> What are you going to do?<br> Sell them?<br> I don't know.<br> I suppose so. Thank you.<br> If I'm appointed administrator of the estate,<br> I shall probably just call in Corey.<br> You mean Lancaster Corey,<br> the art dealer?<br> Yes. He was<br> a friend of Laura's.<br> Let him dispose of everything.<br> It'll be less gruesome that way.<br> Not quite everything, Ann.<br> Two or three things in here<br> belong to me.<br> This vase, for instance...<br> and that, uh, clock,<br> of course...<br> and the antique fire screen.<br> - I only lent them to Laura, you know.<br> - Oh, really, Waldo.<br> Yes, really. This vase is the gem of my<br> collection. I intend to have it back.<br> And the clock and the screen too.<br> But they aren't yours. You gave them<br> to Laura. I won't permit it.<br> Does an alleged fiance<br> have any voice in this matter?<br> I'll take the vase with me now and send someone<br> to collect the other things this very day.<br> Nothing is leaving here<br> except you, Lydecker.<br> Is that your quaint way<br> of indicating dismissal?<br> We're all going anyway. I have to be<br> back at headquarters by noon.<br> Lieutenant, I don't understand.<br> You sent for me, didn't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, don't you want to see me?<br> - Don't you want to ask me some questions?<br> - I'll be seeing you.<br> - Well-<br> - I bid you good day.<br> - Come along, Shelby.<br> - Are you making any progress on the case, Lieutenant?<br> We're doing all right.<br> - Hello, Mark.<br> - Go get something to eat. I'll take over.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Take your time.<br> Fred?<br> - Yes?<br> - What's the matter? Did you go to sleep?<br> This is McPherson.<br> Any calls come through?<br> Well, keep listening.<br> No. Nothing new.<br> I happened to see<br> the lights on.<br> Have you sublet<br> this apartment?<br> You're here often enough<br> to pay rent.<br> - Any objections?<br> - Yes.<br> I object to you prying<br> into Laura's letters...<br> especially those from me.<br> - Why? Yours are the best in the bunch.<br> - Thanks.<br> But I didn't<br> write them to you.<br> Haven't you any sense<br> of privacy?<br> Murder victims have<br> no claim to privacy.<br> Have detectives who buy portraits<br> of murder victims a claim to privacy?<br> Lancaster Corey told me<br> that you've already put in a bid for it.<br> That's none of your business.<br> McPherson, did it ever strike you<br> that you're acting very strangely?<br> It's a wonder you don't come here like a<br> suitor, with roses and a box of candy-<br> drugstore candy, of course.<br> Have you ever dreamed<br> of Laura as your wife...<br> by your side at the policeman's ball,<br> or in the bleachers...<br> or listening to the heroic story of how<br> you got a silver shinbone...<br> from a gun battle<br> with a gangster?<br> - I see you have.<br> - Why don't you go home? I'm busy.<br> Perhaps we can<br> come to terms now.<br> You want the portrait.<br> Perfectly understandable.<br> I want my possessions-<br> my vase, my clock and my screen.<br> Also perfectly understandable.<br> Now, if you-<br> Get going.<br> You better watch out, McPherson,<br> or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward.<br> I don't think they've ever had a patient<br> who fell in love with a corpse.<br> What are you doing here?<br> You're alive.<br> If you don't get out at once,<br> I'm going to call the police.<br> You are Laura Hunt,<br> aren't you?<br> Aren't you?<br> - I'm going to call the police.<br> - Well, I am the police.<br> Mark McPherson.<br> What's this all about?<br> Don't you know?<br> - Don't you know what's happened?<br> - No.<br> Haven't you seen the papers?<br> Where have you been?<br> Up in the country.<br> I- I don't get a newspaper.<br> - Haven't you got a radio?<br> - It was broken.<br> What-<br> Somebody was murdered<br> in this room.<br> Do you have any idea<br> who it was?<br> No.<br> Who had a key<br> to your apartment?<br> Nobody.<br> Are you sure?<br> - When did it happen?<br> - Friday night.<br> What are you<br> going to do now?<br> Find out<br> who was murdered...<br> and then find the murderer.<br> You'd better take off those wet clothes.<br> You might catch cold.<br> Yeah.<br> I found this in my closet.<br> It's Diane Redfern's.<br> It wasn't here when I left.<br> She's one of our models.<br> Just about my size.<br> Beautiful, wasn't she?<br> Do you suppose-<br> Sit down, please.<br> This is Monday night.<br> You left on Friday.<br> - Rather a long weekend, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> What train did you take?<br> The 7:26.<br> - See anybody you knew on the train?<br> - No.<br> - Then what?<br> - Then I got off the train at Norwalk.<br> - Saw nobody you knew at the station either?<br> - No.<br> - Go on.<br> - Then I went to the garage where I keep my car.<br> It's a private garage.<br> Nobody saw me there either.<br> Then I drove to my house.<br> You were there three days.<br> What did you do?<br> Work in my garden.<br> You didn't go out<br> in all that time?<br> No. I had everything<br> I needed in the house.<br> - Nobody came to see you?<br> - Nobody.<br> I went there to be alone.<br> Police were there on Saturday.<br> There was no one in the house.<br> Oh, yes. Saturday,<br> I took a long walk.<br> I walked for hours<br> in the woods.<br> Mm-hmm. You were going to<br> marry Shelby Carpenter this week.<br> Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.<br> Yes.<br> Yet you went away<br> just before your wedding...<br> for a long weekend<br> to be alone.<br> I was tired.<br> I'd been working hard.<br> You know Shelby Carpenter has a key to<br> this apartment. Why didn't you tell me?<br> I know nothing of the sort.<br> He hasn't.<br> How else did the girl<br> get into the apartment?<br> You knew she was in love with Carpenter,<br> that he'd given her your cigarette case.<br> You know all that,<br> don't you?<br> I knew that she was in love with him.<br> She told me so herself.<br> - When did she tell you?<br> - At lunch last Friday.<br> I also know she meant nothing to Shelby.<br> I understand him better than you do.<br> She was found in your<br> dressing gown and slippers.<br> That's hardly the regulation costume<br> for an impersonal chat...<br> between a man and woman<br> who mean nothing to each other.<br> Did you know or did you suspect he was<br> going to bring her here Friday night?<br> How could I? I don't know that he<br> brought her here. Neither do you.<br> - You merely assume it.<br> - What other assumption is possible?<br> Do you love Carpenter so much you'd risk<br> your own safety to protect him?<br> My own safety?<br> Do you suspect me?<br> I suspect nobody and everybody.<br> I'm merely trying to get at the truth.<br> I see you have been trying<br> to get at the truth.<br> You've read things I never meant<br> anyone else to look at.<br> Strictly routine.<br> I'm sorry. Really.<br> I'd better be going. I'll see you<br> in the morning, Miss Hunt.<br> Oh, I must ask you not to leave<br> the house or use the phone.<br> But- But I've got<br> to let my friends know I'm alive.<br> Sorry, Miss Hunt,<br> but I must insist you do as I say.<br> - Am I under arrest?<br> - No.<br> But if anything should happen<br> to you this time, I wouldn't like it.<br> All right.<br> I promise.<br> There's one more thing.<br> You may as well know what I know-<br> some of it, at any rate.<br> It'll save time and a lot<br> of unnecessary fencing.<br> I know that you went away<br> to make up your mind...<br> whether you'd marry<br> Shelby Carpenter or- or not.<br> What did you decide?<br> I want the truth.<br> I decided<br> not to marry him.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Really?<br> Does McPherson know that?<br> Uh-huh. Well, okay.<br> Good-bye.<br> Say, Mark, that was<br> the medical examiner's report.<br> It wasn't Laura Hunt. It was Diane<br> Redfern that was bumped off upstairs.<br> - Kinda balls things up, doesn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Say, you're not taking it too hard.<br> Wait a minute.<br> - Hello?<br> - This is Laura. I've-<br> Don't say anything on the phone.<br> Meet me right away.<br> I'll wait for you in my car<br> in front of Bullitt's.<br> - Was that-<br> - Yeah.<br> Dames are always<br> pulling a switch on you.<br> Stand by.<br> You follow her.<br> I'm gonna tail him.<br> Are you taking it down<br> or putting it away, Carpenter?<br> - It's been fired lately.<br> - Yes. I killed some rabbits with it.<br> - When?<br> - Oh, a while back. I don't know exactly.<br> You know about guns,<br> don't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - How come you didn't clean it afterward?<br> I don't know.<br> I forgot, I suppose.<br> - Your initials?<br> - Yes. I gave it to Laura for protection.<br> She didn't want it,<br> but I insisted.<br> This house is rather isolated,<br> as you see.<br> - Did you teach her how to use it?<br> - No.<br> - Does she know how?<br> - I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.<br> You're a vague sort of a fellow,<br> aren't you, Carpenter?<br> I've spent very little time in observing<br> my own character, Mr. McPherson.<br> You haven't borrowed it lately?<br> You didn't just bring it back tonight?<br> You followed me here.<br> You saw me come in. You ought to know.<br> You, uh, realize<br> the spot you're in, Carpenter?<br> You took that poor girl<br> to Miss Hunt's apartment.<br> You knew all along<br> it was she who was murdered.<br> Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come<br> back any day and spill the whole thing?<br> Or did you plan<br> to kill her too...<br> hide the body someplace<br> and cover up your first crime?<br> You're being fantastic,<br> McPherson.<br> You took a bottle of Black Pony<br> to her house Friday night.<br> I took it there<br> over a week ago.<br> Bessie said it wasn't there Friday<br> night. It was Saturday morning.<br> I can't help what Bessie said.<br> - Where's the key to her apartment?<br> - I haven't got it.<br> - What did you do with it, give it back to her tonight?<br> - I never had one.<br> You didn't take the bottle<br> of scotch to her house Friday night.<br> You haven't got a key to her apartment.<br> How did you get in?<br> - Well, I-<br> - You had a key, and I know it.<br> - Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.<br> - I-<br> Laura kept a duplicate key<br> at her office. I went over and got it.<br> I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wanted<br> to have it out with her once and for all.<br> You know, she thought- Well,<br> she thought she was in love with me.<br> Well, we couldn't go on talking<br> in public places. She was too upset.<br> I couldn't go to her room, and I didn't<br> want to take her to my hotel.<br> - So we went to Laura's.<br> - Yeah?<br> We talked there<br> for about three hours...<br> - and then the doorbell rang and-<br> - Go on.<br> Diane was frightened.<br> But knowing Laura as I've known her...<br> I've learned to be<br> surprised at nothing.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - Her friends would come to her with their troubles...<br> at all hours<br> of the day or night.<br> I asked Diane<br> to answer the door.<br> - Why didn't you go yourself?<br> - Supposing one of Laura's friends had found me there.<br> - Why open the door at all?<br> - They must have seen the light.<br> What about the girl? Diane-<br> what about her reputation?<br> I asked her to tell them Laura had let<br> her the apartment while she was away.<br> Anybody that knew Laura<br> would have believed that.<br> - Yeah. Go on.<br> - Well, then the doorbell rang again.<br> I could hear Diane's mules-<br> Laura's they were-<br> clattering across the bare boards<br> between the rugs.<br> Then there was a moment's silence<br> and then a shot.<br> It was an awful explosion.<br> By the time I reached her,<br> the door was closed.<br> - She lay there on the floor.<br> - Did you go out to see who it was?<br> No. I was too confused, too horrified,<br> incapable of doing anything.<br> The room was dark. I saw only<br> a vague heap lying on the floor.<br> I- I don't think<br> I fully grasped the situation.<br> I think I called her name,<br> but I'm not sure. I-<br> I remember kneeling on the floor,<br> feeling her heart.<br> My first instinct<br> was to call the police.<br> - Why didn't you?<br> - I don't know.<br> Or rather, I was afraid-<br> not only for myself, but for Laura.<br> In a panicky sort of way, I felt I must<br> keep out of this to keep Laura out of it.<br> I know now how foolish<br> and hopeless it was...<br> but there was only<br> one thing on my mind-<br> the safety of a person whose life<br> was dearer to me than my own.<br> Don't you understand that?<br> Did you think<br> Laura had done it?<br> - Did you?<br> - I don't remember what I thought.<br> - Do you think so now?<br> - No.<br> - But you didn't?<br> - No.<br> On Saturday, when our men went to the<br> hotel to tell you that Laura was dead...<br> - you seemed sincerely shocked.<br> - I was. I hadn't expected that mistake.<br> But you had your alibi ready<br> no matter who was dead.<br> Yet you knew the minute<br> Laura got back it wouldn't stick.<br> Don't you see? I was incapable<br> of thinking that far ahead.<br> I was incapable<br> of thinking at all.<br> I was groping for some way<br> to keep Laura's name out of it.<br> I was heartbroken about Diane<br> and panic-stricken about Laura.<br> I haven't slept a full two hours<br> since this thing happened.<br> Let's get back to the present. What did<br> you and Laura talk about tonight?<br> I told her the whole story,<br> just as I've told you.<br> She phoned you after she promised me<br> she wouldn't call anybody.<br> - What did she want?<br> - It's perfectly natural she should want to see me...<br> especially<br> after what's happened.<br> Why don't you tell the truth? She sent<br> you here to get rid of this gun.<br> She did not. It was my own idea.<br> She doesn't even know I'm here.<br> - It works fine, doesn't it?<br> - Yes. Did you think it wouldn't?<br> I hoped it wouldn't.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> - Well, am I under arrest?<br> - No, but you're not to leave town...<br> and it would be<br> foolish of you to try it.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - What's that?<br> - Breakfast.<br> You didn't buy any food<br> when you went out last night.<br> I'll fix some bacon and eggs.<br> Can you make coffee?<br> Suppose you set the table<br> while I get breakfast.<br> Do you always sound like this<br> in the morning?<br> Don't tell me<br> you can cook.<br> My mother always listened sympathetically<br> to my dreams of a career...<br> and then taught me<br> another recipe.<br> Shh! Don't move.<br> It's all right, Bessie.<br> It's all right, Bessie.<br> She's alive.<br> It's all been<br> a mistake, Bessie.<br> I'm not a ghost. Really.<br> I found you,<br> and you were dead.<br> It was Miss Redfern's<br> body you found.<br> How about<br> taking over here-<br> fixing us some<br> coffee and eggs.<br> But I- I saw it<br> with my own eyes.<br> I- I don't<br> understand it.<br> Have you ever<br> heard a ghost ask for eggs?<br> No, miss.<br> You'll be all right,<br> Bessie.<br> Somebody should have warned her.<br> Poor Bessie.<br> By the way, I've asked Waldo Lydecker<br> to come here this morning.<br> - Did you tell him?<br> - No.<br> Why not?<br> It's brutal.<br> I'm not doing it for fun.<br> Why did you break your promise<br> and go out and see Shelby last night?<br> You forced me<br> to give you my word.<br> I never have been and I<br> never will be bound by anything...<br> I don't do<br> of my own free will.<br> Redfern was in love<br> with Carpenter.<br> You admitted that<br> last night.<br> - May I have a match, please?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I also told you that<br> he wasn't in love with her.<br> Just sit still.<br> Hello, Lieutenant.<br> - Morning, my darling.<br> - Hello, dear.<br> Ah. Thank you.<br> Oh. It's on again.<br> Do I have to get a permit from the police<br> department to kiss my fiance good morning?<br> So he made you<br> change your mind.<br> Speaking of changing one's mind,<br> Mr. McPherson...<br> I have just come<br> from my lawyer.<br> Yeah? Did he tell you how much<br> you'll get off for good behavior?<br> No, but he told me that anything<br> I may have said last night...<br> was said under duress<br> and can't be used against me.<br> Besides, none of it was true.<br> Smart lawyer you've got. Maybe he told you<br> how that scotch got up here Friday night...<br> after you'd bought it<br> at Mosconi's.<br> Maybe it was the lawyer<br> who brought Diane Redfern up here.<br> Maybe-<br> Well, McPherson...<br> have you thought over<br> the deal I suggested?<br> Waldo.<br> Waldo.<br> Right-hand pocket.<br> You want a doctor?<br> Right-hand pocket.<br> We'd better take him<br> into the bedroom.<br> - What-<br> - Don't try and say anything, dear.<br> Just be quiet.<br> I think this is<br> carrying things too far.<br> Your methods are vicious.<br> There ought to be a law against it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - How does he feel now?<br> It was a terrible shock.<br> Poor darling.<br> Don't tell me you're in love<br> with him too.<br> Look here, fella. You're not to talk<br> that way to Miss Hunt.<br> Shut up. Why do you cover up<br> for a guy like him?<br> - Don't answer him, Laura.<br> - What story did he tell you last night?<br> - Don't answer him. Let him talk to our lawyer.<br> - Our lawyer?<br> - So now you're covering up for each other.<br> - Look at him, Laura.<br> He's beginning to crack up.<br> He'd use anything to make an arrest...<br> just so he can be a big shot<br> in the headlines.<br> I've got enough on you<br> to arrest you right now.<br> Quick, McPherson,<br> the handcuffs.<br> - Trundle him off to the hoosegow.<br> - You keep out of this.<br> - You'll look nice in bracelets.<br> - Why don't you get down on all fours again, Waldo?<br> It's the only time you've ever<br> kept your mouth shut.<br> I hope you'll forgive<br> my wee touch of epilepsy, my dear.<br> It's an old family custom.<br> Well, McPherson, what does<br> Laura's resurrection do to you?<br> Too bad Diane Redfern<br> can't be resurrected.<br> I'm afraid I've interrupted<br> what you call "a pinch.''<br> Do your duty, McPherson.<br> You know, Lydecker,<br> you've made me change my mind.<br> - For the moment.<br> - Well, in that case...<br> we'll have time<br> for a little get-together.<br> - You'd better order some liquor and some food, Laura.<br> - What for?<br> People are coming<br> to celebrate your return.<br> Ann and Bullitt and Corey.<br> Everybody.<br> - Who asked them to come?<br> - I did, when I was in there.<br> I phoned my man,<br> and he's calling everyone.<br> - Why did you do that, Waldo?<br> - A sense of the fitness of things, my dear.<br> Perhaps our friend can weave all the<br> loose ends into a noose. Eh, McPherson?<br> Sorry you went to all that trouble.<br> I've already called them.<br> You're working yourself<br> to death, darling.<br> - I haven't had a moment with you all day.<br> - It's a very thirsty crowd.<br> Oh, after all,<br> it isn't your homecoming.<br> Aren't you being<br> a little bit nasty, Ann?<br> I feel nasty<br> when I don't see you.<br> Well, you look very sweet. That's<br> a completely wonderful hat, darling.<br> Now, if you'll forgive me,<br> Laura wants a cocktail.<br> - So do I.<br> - Well, here you go.<br> Shelby, why don't you<br> come to your senses?<br> You know it's all over between you<br> and Laura, or it soon will be.<br> But you haven't lost me.<br> Why don't we get married now?<br> - Ann, dear, you don't seem to realize the situation.<br> - Yes, but I do.<br> That's why you need me. We'll get<br> the best lawyer that money can buy.<br> When it's all over, we'll go away- anywhere<br> you want- and forget about all this.<br> Thanks, Ann, but you see,<br> Laura needs me. Sorry.<br> Uh-uh.<br> - Laura.<br> - Thanks.<br> If you don't mind,<br> I'd like a word with Miss Hunt.<br> I don't mind.<br> Talk to her as much as you like.<br> - I see he's taking a new tack.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Trying to make you like him<br> to make you talk.<br> Shelby, tell me,<br> why did you go to-<br> Excuse me.<br> Why did you go<br> to the cottage last night?<br> But don't you know?<br> I was afraid...<br> you wouldn't think<br> of hiding that shotgun.<br> - What shotgun?<br> - The one I gave you.<br> You don't have to lie<br> to me, darling.<br> I'll stand by you.<br> What's the matter,<br> Laura?<br> Oh, I guess I'm just nervous.<br> That's all.<br> So am I.<br> McPherson suspects Shelby.<br> He seems to suspect me too.<br> And so do<br> some of my friends.<br> You?<br> Don't be absurd.<br> - You could never do a thing like that.<br> - And Shelby?<br> Oh, I don't think<br> he did it.<br> But he's capable of it.<br> Are you as interested in McPherson<br> as he is in you?<br> But, Ann, I only<br> met him last night.<br> That's more than<br> long enough sometimes.<br> Anyway, he's better for you<br> than Shelby. Anybody is.<br> - Shelby's better for me.<br> - Why?<br> Because I can afford him,<br> and I understand him.<br> He's no good,<br> but he's what I want.<br> I'm not a nice person,<br> Laura. Neither is he.<br> He knows I know he's...<br> just what he is.<br> He also knows<br> that I don't care.<br> We belong together because we're<br> both weak and can't seem to help it.<br> That's why I know<br> he's capable of murder.<br> He's like me.<br> No, dear, I didn't...<br> but I thought of it.<br> Hello? Yes. Yes.<br> Oh, it's for you, Lieutenant.<br> Thank you, Bessie.<br> McPherson.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Don't worry.<br> I told you I'd bring in<br> the killer today.<br> Yeah. I was just gonna<br> make the arrest when you called.<br> No, I can't tell you now.<br> I'm not alone.<br> You'll see when I come in.<br> Right. See you later.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> - You mean-<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, no.!<br> No. No, no.<br> Not Miss Hunt.<br> Please!<br> Thank you, Bessie.<br> Thank you.<br> Now will you please be good enough<br> to go and get me my things?<br> - Yes, miss.<br> - Laura.<br> Don't worry, darling.<br> Let them accuse you.<br> We'll fight them.<br> I have every weapon-<br> money, connections, prestige.<br> And my column. Every day, millions will<br> read about you and rally to your defense.<br> You talk as if you wanted<br> to see her tried for murder.<br> Yes. Rather than let you blacken<br> her name with suspicions and rumors.<br> Try to prove her guilty. Get on the witness<br> stand with your poor shreds of evidence.<br> I'll expose your cheap methods<br> you used on her.<br> - Thank you, Bessie.<br> - Laura, I told you to watch out for this fella.<br> - Can we go now?<br> - I warned you.<br> It's too bad you didn't<br> open that door Friday night, Carpenter.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Shelby.!<br> Oh, did he hurt you, darling?<br> Darling.<br> Ann.<br> Come in.<br> Sit down.<br> - That'll be all, Gallagher.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All right. Let's have it.<br> Look at me.<br> What are you trying to do,<br> force a confession out of me?<br> You've been holding out,<br> and I want to know why.<br> It'll be easier for you<br> if you tell the truth.<br> What difference<br> does it make what I say?<br> You've made up your mind<br> I'm guilty.<br> - Are you?<br> - Don't tell me you have any doubts.<br> Since you-<br> Oh, I can't.<br> Please. Do I have to have<br> those lights in my face?<br> Thanks. No, I didn't<br> kill Diane Redfern...<br> or anyone else.<br> Then why-<br> Why did you tell me the radio<br> at your country place was broken?<br> - Because it was broken.<br> - Not when I tried it.<br> Just as I was leaving the village,<br> I asked the local handyman to fix it.<br> - How did he get in?<br> - I always leave a key under the flowerpot on the porch.<br> You're too intelligent to make up<br> something I could check so easily...<br> but you're intelligent enough to have<br> broken it yourself to strengthen your story.<br> The main thing I want to know is why you<br> pulled that switch on me about Carpenter.<br> You told me last night<br> you decided not to marry him.<br> - Yes, I guess I did.<br> - But today it was on again. Why?<br> Well, I-<br> I changed my mind.<br> What are you trying to hide? Don't you<br> realize you're involved in a murder?<br> You've got yourself in a jam it's not<br> going to be easy to get out of...<br> unless you're on the level<br> with me.<br> This is no time for secrets.<br> Now, did you really decide<br> to call it off...<br> or did you just tell me that because<br> you knew I wanted to hear it?<br> What went on between you and Carpenter<br> when you saw him last night?<br> Did he persuade you to make up?<br> Or did you agree<br> to pretend you had?<br> - Was that it?<br> - Well, we- That is, both of us thought-<br> He convinced you that if you<br> broke the engagement now...<br> people would think<br> you believed he was guilty.<br> Yes, but now I know it was only<br> because he thought I was.<br> - Did you believe he was guilty?<br> - No. I'm sure he isn't.<br> But he'd gotten himself<br> into an awfully suspicious position...<br> and he's the sort of man that people are<br> always ready to believe the worst about.<br> Are you in love with him?<br> I don't see how<br> I ever could have been.<br> Come on.<br> You're going home.<br> - But I thought I was-<br> - That's- That's what I wanted you to think.<br> You and a few others.<br> I didn't even book you.<br> You mean this was<br> some sort of a game?<br> I was 99% certain<br> about you...<br> but I had to get rid of<br> that one percent doubt.<br> Wasn't there<br> an easier way to make sure?<br> I'd... reached a point<br> where I needed official surroundings.<br> Then it was worth it, Mark.<br> I'll call a cab for you.<br> Good night.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Good night, Mark.<br> I'm going over<br> to Lydecker's apartment.<br> It still doesn't<br> make sense to me, Laura.<br> He's playing some sort<br> of a game with you.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - I don't deny that he's infatuated with you...<br> in some warped way<br> of his own.<br> But he isn't capable of any normal,<br> warm human relationship.<br> He's been dealing<br> with criminals too long.<br> When you were unattainable-<br> when he thought you were dead-<br> that's when<br> he wanted you most.<br> But he was glad<br> when I came back...<br> as if he were<br> waiting for me.<br> Do you know what<br> he calls women? "Dames.''<br> A "dame'' in Washington Heights<br> got a fox fur out of him.<br> - His very words.<br> - That doesn't mean anything.<br> He isn't like that.<br> Laura, you have<br> one tragic weakness.<br> With you, a lean, strong body<br> is the measure of a man...<br> and you always get hurt.<br> No man is ever<br> going to hurt me again.<br> No one, not even you.<br> I? Hurt you?<br> Laura, look at me.<br> When a man has everything<br> in the world that he wants...<br> except what he wants most...<br> he loses his self-respect.<br> It makes him bitter, Laura.<br> He wants to hurt someone<br> as he's been hurt.<br> You were a long time<br> in finding out about Shelby...<br> but... that's over now.<br> We'll be back together again.<br> Haven't you heard of science's<br> newest triumph- the doorbell?<br> I don't like to remind her.<br> - That was the murderer's signal.<br> - Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.<br> I thought you'd like to know. We<br> tested your shotgun. It isn't the one.<br> Now, that's what I call<br> a typical move-<br> a real key<br> to the man's character.<br> First he tells you that<br> he thinks you're innocent...<br> then proceeds<br> to check up on you.<br> When I report that I think<br> she's innocent...<br> that's my own personal opinion.<br> When I submit proof, it becomes<br> the opinion of the department.<br> This entire maneuver could be a trick<br> to get you off your guard.<br> It could be, but it isn't.<br> - I believe you, Mark.<br> - It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.<br> If McPherson weren't muscular and<br> handsome in a cheap sort of way...<br> you'd see through him<br> in a second.<br> Waldo, I mean to be<br> as kind about this as I know how...<br> but I must tell you-you're the one who<br> follows the same obvious pattern.<br> First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.<br> And now I suppose-<br> - Laura, I- - I don't think<br> we should see each other again.<br> - You're not yourself, darling.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> For the first time in ages,<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> Very well.<br> I hope you'll never regret<br> what promises to be...<br> a disgustingly<br> earthy relationship.<br> My congratulations, McPherson.<br> Listen to my broadcast<br> in 15 minutes.<br> I'm discussing<br> great lovers of history.<br> - It was the most difficult thing<br> I ever had to do in my life.<br> All I need is the gun.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Do you know the combination to this thing?<br> - I never knew it had one.<br> - It must be somewhere. Oh.<br> - Have you ever seen this before?<br> - No.<br> Waldo gave you that clock,<br> didn't he?<br> Yes.<br> The doorbell rang...<br> and Diane Redfern<br> went to the door in your negligee.<br> She opened the door.<br> The room was dark.<br> Waldo saw a girl standing there,<br> and he assumed it was you.<br> He figured that if<br> he couldn't have you himself...<br> he was gonna make sure<br> that nobody else did.<br> So he let her have it...<br> with both barrels,<br> right in the face.<br> She fell here.<br> Waldo heard Shelby running<br> from the next room...<br> so he hid<br> in the stairway outside.<br> Shelby was scared,<br> so he ran out as fast as he could.<br> Then Waldo came back<br> and placed the gun in that clock.<br> I knew it.<br> I've felt it<br> ever since I came back...<br> but I didn't want<br> to believe it.<br> I couldn't make myself<br> believe that...<br> Waldo was a murderer.<br> - Well, he is.<br> - He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.<br> - I killed her.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> But I did, Mark. I did as surely<br> as if I'd pulled the trigger myself.<br> That's nonsense.<br> Forget it.<br> No, Mark, I can't.<br> I'm as guilty as he is-<br> not for anything I did,<br> but for what I didn't do.<br> But I couldn't help myself.<br> I owed him too much.<br> I can understand that,<br> Laura...<br> but I can't understand why you've tried so<br> hard to protect Shelby these last few days.<br> I was nearly frantic for fear<br> you'd arrest Shelby.<br> I knew he wasn't guilty.<br> He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.<br> And Waldo was doing everything<br> he could to incriminate him.<br> It was his way<br> of getting rid of Shelby...<br> just as he did Jacoby.<br> I must say, for a charming,<br> intelligent girl...<br> you've certainly surrounded yourself<br> with a remarkable collection of dopes.<br> Don't touch anything.<br> Fingerprints will be important.<br> I'll have the clock<br> picked up tomorrow.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - Arrest Waldo.<br> - Mark.<br> - Can't be helped.<br> That's to make sure<br> you're not disturbed.<br> If the doorbell rings,<br> don't answer it.<br> - I'll phone you in the morning.<br> - Good night, Mark.<br> Get some sleep. Forget<br> the whole thing like a bad dream.<br> And thus,<br> as history has proved, love is eternal.<br> It has been the strongest motivation<br> for human actions...<br> throughout centuries.<br> Love is stronger than life.<br> It reaches beyond<br> the dark shadow of death.<br> I close this evening's<br> broadcast...<br> with some favorite lines<br> from Dowson.<br> "Brief Life."<br> "They are not long,<br> the weeping and the laughter...<br> "love and desire<br> and hate.<br> "I think they have<br> no portion in us...<br> after we pass the gate."<br> - Who's tailing Lydecker?<br> - I was going to, when he came out.<br> - He left five minutes ago.<br> - He didn't come out this way.<br> Must've gone out the back way.<br> Come on. Let's check.<br> "They are<br> not long, the days of wine and roses.<br> "Out of a misty dream,<br> our path emerges for a while...<br> then closes within a dream."<br> - That's the way it is, isn't it, Laura?<br> - Waldo!<br> You have<br> heard the voice of Waldo Lydecker...<br> by electrical transcription.<br> Waldo, you've taken one life.<br> Isn't that enough?<br> The best part of myself-<br> that's what you are.<br> Do you think I'm going to leave it<br> to the vulgar pawing...<br> of a second-rate detective<br> who thinks you're a dame?<br> Do you think I could bear the thought<br> of him holding you in his arms-<br> kissing you, loving you?<br> Laura! It's Mark.<br> Open the door!<br> - There he is now.<br> - Laura.!<br> He'll find us together, Laura...<br> as we always have been, as we always<br> should be, as we always will be.<br> Mark!<br> Good-bye, Laura.<br> Good-bye, my love.<br>
