                        He was the most extraordinary<br> man I ever knew.<br> Did you know him well?<br> I knew him.<br> Well, nil nisi bonum.<br> But did he really deserve<br> a place in here?<br> Lord Allenby, could you give me<br> a few words about Colonel Lawrence?<br> What, more words?<br> The revolt in the desert<br> played a decisive part<br> in the Middle Eastern campaign.<br> Yes, sir, but about<br> Colonel Lawrence himself.<br> No, no. I didn't know<br> him well, you know.<br> Now, Mr. Bentley, you must know as much<br> about Colonel Lawrence as anybody does.<br> Yes, it was my privilege<br> to know him.<br> And to make him<br> known to the world.<br> He was a poet, a scholar<br> and a mighty warrior.<br> Thank you.<br> He was also the most shameless<br> exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.<br> You, sir. Who are you?<br> My name is<br> Jackson Bentley.<br> Well, whoever you are, I overheard<br> your last remark, and I take the<br> gravest possible exception.<br> -He was a very great man.<br> -Did you know him?<br> No, I can't claim<br> to have known him.<br> I once had the honour<br> to shake his hand in Damascus.<br> Knew him?<br> No, I never knew him.<br> He had some minor function<br> on my staff in Cairo.<br> Michael George Hartley,<br> this is a nasty,<br> dark, little room.<br> That's right.<br> We are not happy in it.<br> I am. It's better than<br> a nasty, dark, little trench.<br> -Then you're a big noble fellow.<br> -That's right.<br> Ah, here is William Potter<br> with my newspaper.<br> -Here you are, tosh.<br> -Thanks.<br> Would you care for one of<br> Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?<br> Ta.<br> -Is it there?<br> -Of course.<br> Headlines.<br> But I'll bet it isn't<br> mentioned in the Times.<br> "Bedouin tribes attack<br> Turkish stronghold."<br> And I bet that no one in this whole<br> headquarters even knows it happened.<br> Or would care if it did.<br> Allow me to ignite your cigarette.<br> -Mr. Lawrence?<br> -Yes.<br> -Flimsy, sir.<br> -Thank you.<br> You'll do that once too often.<br> It's only flesh and blood.<br> Michael George Hartley,<br> you're a philosopher.<br> And you're balmy!<br> Oh!<br> -It damn well hurts!<br> -Certainly, it hurts.<br> Well, what's the trick, then?<br> The trick, William Potter,<br> is not minding that it hurts.<br> Oh, by the way, if Captain Gibbon<br> should enquire for me,<br> tell him I've gone for<br> a chat with the general.<br> -He's balmy.<br> -He's all right.<br> Lawrence.<br> Yes?<br> You're supposed to be...<br> Do you usually wear<br> your cap in the mess?<br> Always.<br> You're supposed to be on duty,<br> aren't you? Where are you going?<br> Mustn't talk shop, Freddie,<br> not in the mess.<br> Matter of fact, I'm going for<br> a powwow with the general.<br> I'm not asking as your superior, Lawrence,<br> I'm asking as the secretary of this mess.<br> We don't want chaps in here<br> who should be on duty.<br> Where are you going,<br> please?<br> I must say, Lawrence!<br> -Sorry.<br> -You're a clown, Lawrence.<br> Ah, well, we can't<br> all be lion tamers.<br> Sorry.<br> It's an intrigue, Dryden.<br> And I do not propose to let an<br> overweening, finicky, crass lieutenant<br> thumb his nose at his general officer<br> commanding and get away with it.<br> It doesn't sound as though<br> he'd be any great loss, sir.<br> Now don't try that, Dryden.<br> There's a principle involved.<br> There is, indeed.<br> He's of no use here in Cairo.<br> He might be in Arabia.<br> He knows his stuff, sir.<br> Knows the books, you mean.<br> I've already sent out<br> Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.<br> And if Brighton thinks we should send<br> them some small arms, then we will.<br> Well, what more do you want?<br> That there would be no question<br> of Lieutenant Lawrence<br> giving military advice.<br> By God, I should hope not.<br> It's just that the Arab Bureau would<br> like its own man on the spot, sir, to...<br> To what?<br> To make our own appraisal<br> of the situation.<br> I may as well tell you, it's my<br> considered opinion and that of my staff<br> that any time spent on the<br> Bedouin will be time wasted.<br> They're a nation<br> of sheep-stealers.<br> They did attack Medina.<br> And the Turks made<br> mincemeat of them.<br> We don't know that, sir.<br> We know that they didn't take it.<br> A storm in a teacup, Dryden, a sideshow.<br> If you want my own opinion, this whole<br> theatre of operations is a sideshow.<br> The real war's being fought<br> against the Germans, not the Turks.<br> And not here, but on the<br> Western front in the trenches.<br> Your Bedouin Army,<br> or whatever it calls itself,<br> would be a sideshow<br> of a sideshow.<br> Big things have<br> small beginnings, sir.<br> Does the Arab Bureau<br> want a big thing in Arabia?<br> If they rise against the Turks, does<br> the bureau think they're going to sit<br> down under us when this war is over?<br> The bureau thinks the job of the<br> moment, sir, is to win the war.<br> Don't tell me my duty,<br> Mr. Dryden.<br> -Lawrence, sir.<br> -Send him in.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> Salute.<br> If you're insubordinate with me,<br> Lawrence, I shall put you under arrest.<br> -It's my manner, sir.<br> -Your what?<br> My manner, sir. It looks<br> insubordinate, but it isn't really.<br> I can't make out whether you're bloody<br> bad-mannered or just half-witted.<br> -I have the same problem, sir.<br> -Shut up.<br> The Arab Bureau seem to think you would<br> be of some use to them in Arabia.<br> Why, I can't imagine.<br> You don't seem able to perform<br> your present duties properly.<br> "I cannot fiddle, but I can make<br> a great state from a little city."<br> -What?<br> -Themistocles, sir.<br> A Greek philosopher.<br> I know you've been<br> well-educated, Lawrence.<br> It says so in your dossier.<br> You're the kind of creature<br> I can't stand, Lawrence.<br> But I suppose I could be wrong.<br> All right, Dryden.<br> You can have him for six weeks.<br> Who knows? It might even<br> make a man of him.<br> Come in!<br> Yes, what is it?<br> Navy signal, sir. The convoy will be<br> in Port Said tomorrow night.<br> -Is that certain?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> There doesn't seem<br> to be any artillery, sir.<br> But there must be artillery!<br> Sir, this is something<br> of an expedition.<br> He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,<br> find the Arabs and then get back.<br> He can't do that<br> in six weeks.<br> -Two months, then.<br> -Three.<br> All right, three. Now, will you<br> let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I'd like to say, sir,<br> that I am grateful for this.<br> Shut up and get out.<br> Sir?<br> How can I fight a bloody war<br> without bloody artillery?<br> How did you do it?<br> You might better ask<br> why I bothered to.<br> -Because I'm the man for the job.<br> -I just wonder about that.<br> Of course I'm the man for job.<br> What is the job, by the way?<br> Find Prince Feisal.<br> Good. And when I've found him?<br> Find out what kind of man he is.<br> Find out what his intentions are.<br> I don't mean his immediate intentions.<br> That is Colonel Brighton's<br> business, not yours.<br> I mean, his intentions<br> in Arabia altogether.<br> Oh.<br> That's new.<br> Where are they now?<br> Anywhere within<br> They're Hashemite Bedouins.<br> They can cross 60 miles<br> of desert in a day.<br> Oh, thanks, Dryden.<br> This is going to be fun.<br> Lawrence, only two kinds of<br> creature get fun in the desert:<br> Bedouins and gods, and you're<br> neither. Take it from me.<br> For ordinary men,<br> it's a burning, fiery furnace.<br> No, Dryden.<br> It's going to be fun.<br> It is recognized that you<br> have a funny sense of fun.<br> Here you may drink.<br> One cup.<br> You do not drink?<br> No.<br> I'll drink when you do.<br> I am Bedu.<br> Truly, now, you are<br> a British officer?<br> Yes.<br> From Cairo?<br> Yes.<br> -You did not ride from Cairo?<br> -No.<br> Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.<br> I came by boat.<br> And before?<br> From Britain?<br> Yes.<br> Truly?<br> From Oxfordshire.<br> Is that a desert country?<br> No. A fat country. Fat people.<br> You are not fat?<br> No.<br> I'm different.<br> Here...<br> take it.<br> First I take you to Lord Feisal,<br> then you give it to me.<br> Take it now.<br> Bedu food.<br> Good.<br> More?<br> -Bedu.<br> -Where?<br> From here to Lord Feisal's camp<br> is Harith country.<br> Yes, I know.<br> -I am not Harith.<br> -No.<br> Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.<br> Ah...<br> Put the right foot in tight.<br> Lock it with your left foot.<br> Then, when you are<br> ready to go,<br> hit her on the shoulder<br> and say, "Hut-hut-hut."<br> Hut-hut-hut!<br> Ah.<br> Today will be difficult,<br> but tomorrow, good riding.<br> I think we reach Masturah<br> Well tomorrow. Yes.<br> And from Masturah Well to Lord<br> Feisal's camp, one day more.<br> Now!<br> Good?<br> It's all right.<br> This is a Harith well.<br> The Harith are a dirty people.<br> Turks?<br> Bedu.<br> Who is he?<br> Tafas!<br> He is dead.<br> Yes.<br> Why?<br> This is my well.<br> I have drunk from it.<br> You are welcome.<br> He was my friend.<br> -That?<br> -Yes, that.<br> -This pistol yours?<br> -No, his.<br> His?<br> Mine.<br> Then I will use it.<br> Your friend...<br> was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.<br> I know.<br> I am Ali ibn el Kharish.<br> I have heard of you.<br> So...<br> what was a Hazimi<br> doing here?<br> He was taking me<br> to help Prince Feisal.<br> -You have been sent from Cairo.<br> -Yes.<br> I have been in Cairo<br> for my schooling.<br> I can both read and write.<br> My Lord Feisal already<br> has an Englishman.<br> -Yes.<br> -What is your name?<br> My name is for my friends.<br> None of my friends<br> is a murderer.<br> You are angry, English.<br> He was nothing.<br> The well is everything.<br> The Hazimi may not drink<br> at our wells.<br> He knew that.<br> Salaam.<br> Hut-hut-hut.<br> Sherif Ali.<br> So long as the Arabs fight<br> tribe against tribe,<br> so long will they be<br> a little people,<br> a silly people.<br> Greedy, barbarous<br> and cruel, as you are.<br> Come.<br> I will take you to Feisal.<br> I do not want your<br> company, sherif.<br> Wadi Safra is another day<br> from here.<br> You will not find it, and<br> not finding it, you will die.<br> I will find it with this.<br> Good army compass.<br> How if I take it?<br> Then you would be a thief.<br> Have you no fear, English?<br> My fear is my concern.<br> Truly.<br> God be with you, English.<br> # As I walk along the<br> Bois de Boulogne #<br> # With an independent air #<br> # You can hear the girls declare #<br> # He must be a millionaire #<br> # You can<br> Rum-tee-tum-tee-tum-tee-tum #<br> # Tee-tummely-tum-tee-tum-tee-tum #<br> # I'm the man who broke the bank<br> At Monte Carlo #<br> Hey, you!<br> -I've been waiting for you.<br> -Did you know I was coming?<br> I knew someone was coming.<br> Feisal told me.<br> How did he know?<br> Not much happens within 50 miles<br> of Feisal that Feisal doesn't know.<br> I'll give him that. No escort?<br> My guide was killed<br> at the Masturah Well.<br> -Turks?<br> -No, an Arab.<br> Bloody savages.<br> -This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?<br> -Yes, they're over there.<br> Now, just a minute. What's<br> your name and who sent you?<br> Lawrence. I've been<br> seconded to the Arab Bureau.<br> Oh.<br> And what are you to do<br> for the Arab Bureau?<br> Well, it's rather vague, sir.<br> I'm to appreciate the situation.<br> Well, that won't be difficult.<br> The situation's bloody awful.<br> Their morale, if ever<br> they had any, which I doubt,<br> the Turks knocked out of them<br> in front of Medina, with howitzers.<br> They're fading away<br> by dozens every night.<br> What I want to say<br> to you is this:<br> That wherever you are<br> and whoever you are with,<br> you're a British-serving officer.<br> And here's an order.<br> When we get into that camp,<br> you're to keep your mouth shut.<br> Do you understand<br> what I'm saying?<br> Yes, sir. I understand<br> what you're saying.<br> You'll make your appreciation<br> and get back to...<br> Oh, my God.<br> Not again.<br> I've told him!<br> God knows I've told him.<br> "Move South," I've said.<br> "You're still in range."<br> They simply will not understand<br> what modern weapons do!<br> Stand and fight.<br> Stand and fight.<br> Fire back at them.<br> -Who are you?<br> -Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.<br> Seconded to the Arab Bureau.<br> This is a bloody mess, sir.<br> We'll have to move south.<br> Yes, yes, colonel,<br> You were right<br> and I was wrong.<br> We must take some<br> thought for the wounded.<br> Well, we can take care<br> of them at Yenbo, sir.<br> If they can get to Yenbo.<br> Well, they can hardly<br> come with us, sir.<br> No. They must try to reach Yenbo.<br> Lieutenant?<br> Lawrence.<br> You understand,<br> Lieutenant Lawrence,<br> my people are unused to<br> explosives and machines.<br> First the guns,<br> and now this.<br> Cigarette?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Hey.<br> Cigarette,<br> Your Excellency?<br> Umph off.<br> Please, Your Excellency.<br> Just one for two?<br> Hold it, Jenkins!<br> Jenkins! Jen...<br> Jenkins!<br> Aurens?<br> Aurens.<br> You have no servant.<br> -I don't need a servant.<br> -No?<br> We can do everything. Light fires,<br> cook food, wash clothes.<br> -Yes, everything.<br> -I don't doubt it.<br> -It will be very nice for you.<br> -I can't afford it.<br> Recite, then, as much of the Koran<br> as may be easy to you.<br> God knoweth that there be<br> some among you sick,<br> while others travel through the Earth<br> in quest for the bounties of God.<br> Others do battle<br> in his cause.<br> Recite, therefore,<br> as much as may be easy.<br> And observe the prayers.<br> This will be best and richest<br> in the recompense.<br> Seek ye the<br> forgiveness of God.<br> Verily, God is<br> forgiving, merciful...<br> Greetings, Ali.<br> -My lord.<br> -Sherif Ali.<br> Lieutenant Lawrence, you have<br> met Sherif Ali, I think.<br> Yes, my lord.<br> And now, Selim,<br> "The Brightness."<br> "By the noonday<br> brightness,<br> and by the night<br> when it darkeneth,<br> thy Lord hath<br> not forsaken thee,<br> neither hath he<br> been displeased."<br> "And surely the future shall be<br> better for thee than the past."<br> "And in the end shall your Lord<br> be bounteous to thee<br> and thou be satisfied."<br> So...<br> Yes, colonel.<br> -I want a decision, sir.<br> -You want me to fall back on Yenbo.<br> Well, you're not doing<br> much good here, sir.<br> I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,<br> but we can't supply you here.<br> You could supply<br> us through Aqaba.<br> Aqaba?<br> Well, if you can get ahold of Aqaba,<br> sir, of course we can supply you.<br> -But you can't.<br> -You could.<br> You mean the navy?<br> The Turks have 12-inch guns<br> at Aqaba, sir.<br> Can you imagine<br> what that means?<br> Yes, I can imagine.<br> Put that out of your mind, sir.<br> The navy's got other things to do.<br> Oh, yes. Protecting<br> the Suez Canal.<br> The one essential sector of this<br> front is and must be the canal.<br> You can see that,<br> sir, surely.<br> I see that the canal is<br> an essential British interest.<br> It is of little<br> consequence to us.<br> I must ask you<br> not to speak like that, sir.<br> British and Arab interests<br> are one and the same.<br> -Possibly.<br> -Ha!<br> Ha!<br> Upon my word, sir,<br> you're ungrateful.<br> Fall back on Yenbo and<br> we will give you equipment.<br> Give you arms, advice,<br> training, everything.<br> -Guns?<br> -A modern rifle for every man.<br> No. Guns. Artillery.<br> Guns like the Turkish guns<br> at Medina.<br> Yes, give us guns<br> and keep the training.<br> Your men need training<br> far more than guns, sir.<br> Hmph. The English will<br> teach the Bedu to fight?<br> We will teach them, Sherif Ali,<br> to fight a modern, mechanized army.<br> In the...<br> Yes, lieutenant?<br> What do you think about Yenbo?<br> I think it is far<br> from Damascus.<br> We'll have you in Damascus, sir.<br> Never fear.<br> Have you been in Damascus,<br> Mr. Lawrence?<br> Yes, my lord.<br> It is beautiful, is it not?<br> -Very.<br> -That will do, Lawrence.<br> Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,<br> sir, but discipline will.<br> Look, sir, Great Britain is a small<br> country, it's much smaller than yours.<br> Small population<br> compared with some.<br> It's small, but it's great.<br> And why?<br> -Because it has guns.<br> -Because it has discipline.<br> Because it has a navy. Because of this,<br> the English go where they please<br> and strike where they please.<br> And this makes them great.<br> -Right.<br> -Mr. Lawrence, that will do!<br> Lieutenant Lawrence, sir,<br> is not your military adviser.<br> But I would like to hear<br> his opinion.<br> Damn it, Lawrence!<br> Who do you take your orders from?<br> From Lord Feisal,<br> in Feisal's tent.<br> Old fool! Why turn<br> from him to him?<br> They are master and man.<br> My lord, I think...<br> I think your book is right.<br> The desert is an ocean<br> in which no oar is dipped.<br> And on this ocean, the Bedu go where<br> they please and strike where they please.<br> This is the way<br> the Bedu has always fought.<br> You're famed throughout the world<br> for fighting in this way.<br> And this is the way<br> you should fight now.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> but you're wrong.<br> Fall back on Yenbo, sir, and<br> the Arab Rising becomes one<br> poor unit in the British army.<br> What is this to you?<br> Lawrence, do you know<br> you're a traitor?<br> No, no, colonel.<br> He is a young man,<br> and young men are passionate.<br> They must say their say.<br> But wiser people must decide.<br> I know you are right.<br> Very well, sir. When shall we move?<br> The sooner the better.<br> You'll lose another<br> You tread heavily...<br> but you speak the truth.<br> I will give you my answer tomorrow.<br> And now...<br> it is late.<br> Colonel Brighton means to put my men<br> under European officers, does he not?<br> In effect,<br> my lord, yes.<br> And I must do it,<br> because the Turks<br> have European guns.<br> But I fear to do it...<br> upon my soul I do.<br> The English have a great<br> hunger for desolate places.<br> I fear they hunger<br> for Arabia.<br> Then you must<br> deny it to them.<br> You are an Englishman.<br> Are you not loyal to England?<br> To England and<br> to other things.<br> To England and<br> Arabia both?<br> And is that possible?<br> I think you are another of these<br> desert-loving English.<br> Doughty, Stanhope,<br> Gordon of Khartoum.<br> No Arab loves the desert.<br> We love water and green trees.<br> There is nothing in the desert.<br> And no man needs nothing.<br> Or is it that you think we are<br> something you can play with,<br> because we are a little people,<br> a silly people,<br> greedy, barbarous<br> and cruel?<br> Or do you know, lieutenant,<br> in the Arab city of Cordoba<br> were two miles of public<br> lighting in the streets<br> when London was a village?<br> Yes, you were great.<br> Nine centuries ago.<br> Time to be great again,<br> my lord.<br> Which is why my father made<br> this war upon the Turks.<br> My father, Mr. Lawrence,<br> not the English.<br> But my father is old...<br> and I...<br> I long for the vanished<br> gardens of Cordoba.<br> However, before the gardens<br> must come the fighting.<br> To be great again, it seems<br> that we need the English,<br> or...<br> Or?<br> What no man can<br> provide, Mr. Lawrence.<br> We need a miracle.<br> Aqaba.<br> Aqaba.<br> From the land.<br> You are mad.<br> To come to Aqaba by land we should<br> have to cross the Nefud Desert.<br> That's right.<br> The Nefud cannot be crossed.<br> I'll cross it if you will.<br> You? It takes more than a compass,<br> Englishman.<br> The Nefud is the worst place<br> God created.<br> I can't answer for the place.<br> Only for myself.<br> Fifty men?<br> Fifty? Against Aqaba?<br> If 50 men came<br> out of the Nefud<br> they would be 50 men<br> other men might join.<br> The Howeitat<br> are there, I hear.<br> The Howeitat are brigands.<br> They'll sell themselves to anyone.<br> -Good fighters, though.<br> -Good...<br> Yes. There are<br> guns at Aqaba.<br> They face the sea, Sherif Ali,<br> and cannot be turned around.<br> From the landward side,<br> there are no guns at Aqaba.<br> With good reason. It cannot be<br> approached from the landward side.<br> Certainly the Turks<br> don't dream of it.<br> Aqaba's over there.<br> It's only a matter of going.<br> You are mad.<br> And where are you<br> going, lieutenant?<br> With 50 of my men.<br> To work your miracle.<br> Blasphemy is a bad beginning<br> for such a journey.<br> -Who told you?<br> -Ali did.<br> Why not you?<br> You are falling back<br> on Yenbo, sir?<br> Yes. Yes, I must.<br> But I will spare these to you.<br> Did Ali break<br> confidence to tell me?<br> Sherif Ali owes you<br> his allegiance, my lord.<br> Yet you did not tell<br> Colonel Brighton.<br> No.<br> Since you do know,<br> we can claim to ride<br> in the name of Feisal of Mecca.<br> Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,<br> you may claim it.<br> But in whose name<br> do you ride?<br> Sherif, I caught them.<br> They have tracked us.<br> They were here.<br> I caught them.<br> Why are you here? Boy!<br> To serve Lord Aurens, sherif.<br> This is true, Aurens.<br> They do wish it.<br> You have been tracking us.<br> -You were told to stay.<br> -No, sherif.<br> Our camel strayed.<br> We followed her.<br> She led us here<br> to be Lord Aurens' servants.<br> -It is the will of Allah.<br> -Blasphemy.<br> Don't do that.<br> No, Aurens, these are not servants.<br> These are outcasts, parent-less.<br> Be warned.<br> They are not suitable.<br> They sound very suitable.<br> You can ride with the baggage.<br> These are not servants.<br> These are worshippers.<br> Aurens.<br> One shilling,<br> every week.<br> That is fair.<br> -Each.<br> -No.<br> -That is too much.<br> -All right.<br> They will be lucky for you.<br> Allah favours the compassionate.<br> There is the railway.<br> And that is the desert.<br> From here until the other side,<br> no water but what we carry.<br> For the camels, no water at all.<br> If the camels die...<br> we die.<br> And in 20 days<br> they will start to die.<br> There's no time to waste, then,<br> is there?<br> Hut!<br> I was thinking.<br> You were drifting.<br> Yes. It will not<br> happen again.<br> Be warned,<br> you were drifting.<br> It will not<br> happen again.<br> That water is wasted.<br> From now on,<br> we must travel by night<br> and rest while it is<br> too hot to travel.<br> A few hours each day.<br> Why don't we start now?<br> No. We will rest now.<br> Three hours.<br> Fine.<br> I'll wake you.<br> Do we rest here?<br> There is no rest now<br> short of water, Aurens.<br> The other side of that.<br> And how much<br> of that is there?<br> I'm not sure.<br> But however much, it must be crossed<br> before tomorrow's sun gets up.<br> This is the sun's anvil.<br> Have we done it?<br> No, but we're off the anvil.<br> Thank God for that anyway.<br> Yes, thank him.<br> Aurens, I do not think you know<br> how you have tempted him.<br> I know.<br> We've done it.<br> God willing.<br> When do we<br> reach the wells?<br> God willing,<br> midday.<br> -Then we've done it.<br> -Thank him, Aurens. Thank him.<br> Aurens.<br> Gasim's.<br> What's happened to him?<br> God knows.<br> Why don't you stop?<br> For what?<br> He will be dead by midday.<br> We must go back.<br> What for,<br> to die with Gasim?<br> In one hour<br> comes the sun.<br> In God's name, understand!<br> We cannot go back!<br> I can.<br> Take the boys.<br> If you go back, you<br> kill yourself, is all.<br> Gasim you have<br> killed already.<br> Get out of my way.<br> Gasim's time is come,<br> Aurens. It is written.<br> Nothing is written!<br> Go back, then!<br> What did you bring us here for<br> with your blasphemous conceit?<br> Eh? English blasphemer!<br> Aqaba?<br> Was it Aqaba?<br> You will not be<br> at Aqaba, English!<br> Go back, blasphemer,<br> but you will not<br> be at Aqaba.<br> I shall be at Aqaba.<br> That is written.<br> In here.<br> English!<br> English!<br> Aurens!<br> Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye!<br> Daud!<br> Aurens! Daud!<br> Daud! Daud!<br> Farraj!<br> Daud.<br> Aurens.<br> Nothing is written.<br> Aurens.<br> Aurens.<br> El Aurens.<br> Farraj.<br> Wash.<br> Farraj.<br> El Aurens.<br> Truly, for some men nothing is<br> written unless they write it.<br> Not El Aurens.<br> Just Lawrence.<br> -El Aurens is better.<br> -True.<br> Your father too,<br> just Mr. Lawrence?<br> My father is Sir<br> Thomas Chapman.<br> -Is that a lord?<br> -A kind of lord.<br> Then when he dies,<br> you too will be a lord.<br> No.<br> Ah.<br> You have an elder brother.<br> No.<br> But then, I do not<br> understand this.<br> -Your father's name is Chapman.<br> -Ali.<br> He didn't marry my mother.<br> I see.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It seems to me that you are free<br> to choose your own name, then.<br> Yes, I suppose I am.<br> El Aurens is best.<br> All right, I'll settle<br> for El Aurens.<br> They are the robes of a<br> sherif of the Beni Wejh.<br> Very fine.<br> -Great honour.<br> -The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.<br> -Is it permitted?<br> -Surely.<br> -Salaam.<br> -Salaam.<br> He for whom nothing is written may<br> write himself a clan. Salaam.<br> -Salaam.<br> -Salaam.<br> They are good<br> for riding. Try.<br> What are you doing,<br> Englishman?<br> As you see.<br> Are you alone?<br> Almost.<br> Are you with that party of dogs<br> who are drinking at my well?<br> Yours?<br> I am Auda Abu Tayi.<br> I've heard of another<br> man of that name.<br> Other? What other?<br> The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need<br> to summon help to look after his wells.<br> He must be a great hero.<br> He is.<br> He wouldn't refuse water to men coming<br> out of the great Nefud Desert.<br> Now, would he not?<br> Hm.<br> No, that must be some other man.<br> Here is my help.<br> Son, what<br> fashion is this?<br> -Harith, Father.<br> -What manner of Harith?<br> A Beni Wejh sherif.<br> And is he Harith?<br> No, Father, English.<br> Son,<br> they are stealing<br> our water.<br> Tell them we are coming.<br> -Tell them.<br> -Ha!<br> -Empty that!<br> -Do not!<br> It is Auda of the Howeitat<br> who speaks.<br> It is Ali of the Harith<br> who answers.<br> Harith.<br> Ali.<br> Does your father<br> still steal?<br> No.<br> Does Auda take me<br> for one of his own bastards?<br> No. There is no<br> resemblance.<br> Alas, you resemble<br> your father.<br> -Auda flatters me.<br> -You are easily flattered.<br> I knew your father well.<br> Did you know your own?<br> Auda!<br> We are 50, you are two.<br> How if we shot you down?<br> Why, then you have a blood<br> feud with the Howeitat.<br> -Do you desire it?<br> -Not the generals in Cairo,<br> nor the sultan<br> himself desire that.<br> Call off your men.<br> No, no, boy.<br> This honours<br> the unworthy.<br> I've only just begun<br> to teach him.<br> And what are you teaching him<br> today? Howeitat hospitality?<br> Be not clever<br> with me, English.<br> -Who is he?<br> -A friend of Prince Feisal's.<br> Oh.<br> -So you desire my hospitality?<br> -Yes.<br> Is he your tongue?<br> We do desire it.<br> Then it is given,<br> if you will take it.<br> I'm at my summer camp,<br> a poor place.<br> Well, to me it seems a poor place.<br> Some men find it marvellous.<br> Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks<br> to buy you, friends of Feisal.<br> But,<br> dine with me.<br> Dine with Auda, English.<br> Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.<br> It is my pleasure that you dine<br> with me in Wadi Rumm!<br> This thing you work<br> against Aqaba,<br> what profit do you<br> hope from it?<br> We work it for<br> Feisal of Mecca.<br> The Harith do not<br> work for profit.<br> Well, if it is in a man to be<br> a servant, Sherif Ali,<br> he could find worse<br> masters than Feisal.<br> But I...<br> I cannot serve.<br> You permit the Turks<br> to stay in Aqaba.<br> Yes, it is my pleasure.<br> We do not work this thing<br> for Feisal.<br> No?<br> -For the English, then?<br> -For the Arabs.<br> The Arabs?<br> The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,<br> Beni Sahkr, these I know.<br> I have even heard<br> of the Harith.<br> But the Arabs?<br> What tribe is that?<br> They're a tribe of slaves.<br> They serve the Turks.<br> Well, they are<br> nothing to me.<br> My tribe is<br> the Howeitat.<br> Who work only<br> for profit.<br> Who work at<br> Auda's pleasure.<br> And Auda's pleasure<br> is to serve the Turks.<br> Serve?<br> I serve?<br> It is the servant<br> who takes money.<br> I am Auda Abu Tayi.<br> -Does Auda serve?<br> -No!<br> -Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?<br> -No!<br> I carry 23 great wounds,<br> all got in battle.<br> Seventy-five men have I killed<br> with my own hands, in battle.<br> I scatter, I burn my enemies' tents.<br> I take away their flocks and herds.<br> The Turks pay me a golden<br> treasure, yet I am poor!<br> Because I am a<br> river to my people.<br> Is that service?<br> No.<br> And yet now it seems<br> Auda has grown old.<br> And lost his taste<br> for fighting.<br> It is well you say it in<br> my tent, thou old tulip.<br> Yet this is a tulip that<br> the Turks could not buy.<br> Why should they wish to?<br> Now...<br> I will tell you what they pay me,<br> and you will tell me if this is<br> a servant's wages.<br> They pay me,<br> month by month,<br> -Who told you that?<br> -I have long ears.<br> And a long tongue<br> between them.<br> It's a trifle.<br> A trifle which they take<br> from a great box they have.<br> In Aqaba.<br> -In Aqaba?<br> -Where else?<br> You trouble me<br> like women.<br> Friends, we've been foolish.<br> Auda will not come to Aqaba.<br> -No.<br> -For money?<br> -No.<br> -For Feisal?<br> -No.<br> -Nor to drive away the Turks.<br> He will come...<br> because it is his pleasure.<br> Thy mother mated<br> with a scorpion.<br> Make God your agent!<br> Aqaba!<br> Aqaba!<br> God be with you.<br> God be with you.<br> God be with you.<br> God be with you.<br> Yes.<br> Aqaba.<br> Tomorrow we will<br> go and get it.<br> -Do you think we shall?<br> -Yes.<br> If you are right<br> about the guns.<br> He killed.<br> He dies.<br> This is the end<br> of Aqaba.<br> -One of our men murdered one of Auda's man.<br> -Why?<br> Theft? Blood feud?<br> It makes no matter why.<br> Ali!<br> It is an ancient wound.<br> I didn't come here to<br> watch a tribal bloodbath.<br> It is the law, Aurens.<br> The law says<br> the man must die.<br> If he dies, will that<br> content the Howeitat?<br> Yes.<br> Sherif Ali!<br> If none of Lord Auda's men<br> harms any of yours,<br> -will that content the Harith?<br> -Yes.<br> Then I will execute the law.<br> I have no tribe.<br> And no one is offended.<br> Gasim.<br> Did you do it?<br> Well, Aurens...<br> What ails the<br> Englishman?<br> That that he killed was the man<br> he brought out of the Nefud.<br> It was written, then.<br> Better to have left him.<br> It was execution, Aurens.<br> No shame in that.<br> Besides, it was necessary.<br> You gave life<br> and you took it.<br> The writing<br> is still yours.<br> Auda Abu Tayi!<br> The miracle is<br> accomplished.<br> Garlands for<br> the conqueror.<br> Tribute for the prince.<br> Flowers for the man.<br> I'm none of those<br> things, Ali.<br> -What, then?<br> -Don't know.<br> Thanks.<br> My God, I love this country.<br> What?<br> No gold in Aqaba!<br> No great box!<br> Auda, I found it!<br> That's a pity.<br> Ali, you get a message<br> down the coast to Yenbo.<br> Tell Feisal to find<br> boats, any boats,<br> and bring the Arab army<br> here to Aqaba, quickly.<br> And you?<br> I'm going to tell<br> the generals<br> in Cairo.<br> Yes, cross Sinai.<br> Come on!<br> Sinai?<br> Yes.<br> -With these?<br> -They'll be all right with me.<br> Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin<br> arrived in Cairo and said:<br> "We've taken Aqaba,"<br> the generals would laugh.<br> I see.<br> In Cairo you will put off<br> these funny clothes.<br> You will wear trousers and tell stories<br> of our quaintness and barbarity<br> and then they will<br> believe you.<br> You're an ignorant man.<br> Paper.<br> Paper!<br> There is no gold in Aqaba.<br> No gold.<br> No great box!<br> Did Auda come to<br> Aqaba for gold?<br> For my pleasure,<br> as you said.<br> But gold is honourable...<br> and Aurens promised gold.<br> Aurens lied.<br> See, Auda.<br> "The Crown of England...<br> promises to pay...<br> to Auda Abu Tayi."<br> Signed in<br> His Majesty's absence<br> by...<br> me.<br> In 10 days...<br> I'll be back with the gold.<br> With gold, with guns,<br> with everything.<br> Ten days.<br> You'll cross Sinai?<br> Why not?<br> Moses did.<br> And you will take<br> the children?<br> Moses did.<br> Moses was a prophet,<br> and beloved of God.<br> He said there was gold here.<br> He lied.<br> He is not perfect.<br> Lord, can we not rest?<br> I told you, no rest till they know<br> that I have Aqaba.<br> Have you two<br> slept in beds?<br> Farraj?<br> Daud?<br> With sheets?<br> Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest<br> room in the finest hotel in Cairo.<br> I promise.<br> Then it shall<br> be so, lord.<br> Look!<br> Pillar of fire.<br> No, lord. Dust.<br> My compass.<br> No matter.<br> If we ride west,<br> we must strike the canal.<br> Due west.<br> Come on!<br> Aurens!<br> Aurens!<br> Farraj!<br> Farraj!<br> Farraj, don't! Don't!<br> Don't!<br> Aurens.<br> Why do you walk?<br> But why, lord?<br> Aurens.<br> But why, lord?<br> There is room for both.<br> It serves no purpose.<br> Aurens, look!<br> Aurens.<br> Aurens. Aurens.<br> Aurens.<br> It's all right, Farraj.<br> It's all right.<br> Hey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey!<br> Hey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey!<br> Who are you?<br> Who are you?<br> -Daud!<br> -We're here, sir.<br> You taking him<br> in there, sir?<br> Yes.<br> Here!<br> Here. You!<br> And where the hell do you think<br> you're going to, Mustapha?<br> We are thirsty.<br> -Mr. Lawrence, is it?<br> -Yes.<br> -Are you going to the officers' bar, sir?<br> -Yes.<br> You can't take him in there, sir.<br> What do you think<br> you look like?<br> No, no.<br> You must go.<br> No, no. Go,<br> effendi, go!<br> Get out! You must<br> get out! Get out!<br> We want two large<br> glasses of lemonade.<br> This is a bar<br> for British officers.<br> That's all right.<br> We are not particular.<br> Lawrence!<br> Are you off your head?<br> No. Oddly enough I'm not.<br> Now look here, Lawrence.<br> Just clear out of here, will you?<br> Get that boy out of here.<br> Corporal, we'll have<br> this one out anyway.<br> -Get that wog out of here.<br> -Yes, clear off.<br> What's going on?<br> -It's Lawrence, sir.<br> -Lemonade with ice.<br> Well?<br> Explain yourself.<br> We've taken Aqaba.<br> -Taken Aqaba? Who has?<br> -We have.<br> Our side in this war has.<br> The wogs have.<br> We have.<br> He likes your lemonade.<br> You mean<br> the Turks have gone?<br> No, they're still there,<br> but they've no boots.<br> Prisoners, sir. We took them<br> prisoners. The entire garrison.<br> No, that's not true.<br> We killed some.<br> Too many, really.<br> I'll manage it better next time.<br> There's been a lot of killing<br> one way or another.<br> Cross my heart and hope to die,<br> it's all perfectly true.<br> -It isn't possible.<br> -Yes, it is.<br> I did it.<br> You'd better<br> talk to Allenby.<br> General Allenby?<br> Yes, he's in command now.<br> Murray's gone.<br> Well, that's a step<br> in the right direction.<br> First, I want a room.<br> With a bed, with sheets.<br> -Yes, of course.<br> -It's for him.<br> Right. You want a bed<br> yourself, don't you?<br> See Allenby<br> first, though.<br> Will he see me?<br> I think so.<br> Do that, then.<br> -I'd better shave.<br> -Yes, you had.<br> You'd better get into<br> some trousers too.<br> "Undisciplined.<br> Unpunctual.<br> Untidy.<br> Several languages.<br> Knowledge of music...<br> literature.<br> Knowledge of...<br> Knowledge of..."<br> You're an interesting man,<br> there's no doubt about it.<br> -Who told you to take Aqaba?<br> -Nobody.<br> -Sir.<br> -Sir.<br> Then why did you?<br> -Aqaba's important.<br> -Why is it important?<br> -It's the Turkish route to the canal.<br> -Not anymore.<br> They're coming<br> through Beersheba.<br> I know, but we've gone<br> forward to Gaza.<br> -So?<br> -So that left Aqaba behind your right.<br> True.<br> And it will be further behind your<br> right when you go for Jerusalem.<br> Am I going<br> for Jerusalem?<br> Yes.<br> Very well.<br> Aqaba behind<br> my right.<br> It threatened<br> El' Arsh and Gaza.<br> Anything else?<br> Yes.<br> Aqaba's linked<br> with Medina.<br> Do you think we should<br> shift them out of Medina now?<br> No. I think you should<br> leave them there.<br> You acted without<br> orders, you know.<br> Shouldn't officers use<br> their initiative at all times?<br> Not really. It's awfully<br> dangerous, Lawrence.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Already?<br> Yes.<br> I'm promoting you major.<br> I don't think<br> that's a very good idea.<br> I didn't ask you.<br> I want you to go back<br> and carry on<br> the good work.<br> No.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> -Why not?<br> -Well, I, it's...<br> Let me see now...<br> I killed two people.<br> I mean, two Arabs.<br> One was a boy.<br> That was...<br> yesterday.<br> I led him into a quicksand.<br> The other was a man.<br> That was...<br> before Aqaba, anyway.<br> I had to execute him<br> with my pistol.<br> There was something<br> about it I didn't like.<br> -Well, naturally.<br> -No. Something else.<br> I see. Well, that's all right.<br> Let it be a warning.<br> No. Something else.<br> What, then?<br> I enjoyed it.<br> Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.<br> You're tired.<br> What do you mean by coming here dressed<br> like that? Amateur theatricals?<br> Oh, yes. Entirely.<br> Let me see that hat thing,<br> or whatever it is.<br> Fascinating gear<br> they wear.<br> How do you think I would<br> look in this, Harry?<br> -Damn ridiculous, sir.<br> -Here, you keep it.<br> What I'm trying to say is,<br> I don't think I'm fit for it.<br> Really? What do you<br> think, Dryden?<br> Before he did it, sir,<br> I'd have said it couldn't be done.<br> -Brighton?<br> -I know what he thinks.<br> I think you should recommend<br> a decoration, sir.<br> I don't think it matters<br> what his motives were.<br> It was a brilliant<br> bit of soldiering.<br> -Mr. Perkins!<br> -Sir!<br> Let's have a drink, gentlemen.<br> -You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -What do you think about it?<br> -Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done, sir.<br> -Thank you, Mr. Perkins.<br> -Sir!<br> Come on, then.<br> You're a clever man, sir.<br> No, but I know a good<br> thing when I see one.<br> That's fair, surely.<br> Look here, now. If I am going<br> to break through to Jerusalem,<br> I must concentrate, not dissipate.<br> -Clausewitz.<br> -You know better?<br> I fight like Clausewitz,<br> then you fight like Saxe.<br> We should do very well<br> indeed, shouldn't we?<br> Easy, gentlemen, please.<br> -Will you give us something to drink?<br> -Of course, sir.<br> I'm here at the invitation<br> of Major Lawrence.<br> Tracy.<br> Shall we go outside?<br> So you hold bound<br> the Turkish desert army?<br> Yes.<br> With 1000 Arabs?<br> Delivered anywhere,<br> day or night.<br> It means 1000 camels.<br> That means 1000 packs of high<br> explosives and 1000 crack rifles.<br> We can cross Arabia while Johnny Turk<br> is still turning round.<br> I'll smash his railways.<br> And while he's mending them,<br> I'll smash them somewhere else.<br> In 13 weeks I can<br> have Arabia in chaos.<br> You are going back, then?<br> Yes.<br> Of course<br> I'm going back.<br> Hm. Well, if we can<br> see it, so can the Turk.<br> If he finds he's using four divisions<br> to fend off a handful of bandits,<br> he'll withdraw.<br> He daren't withdraw.<br> Arabia's part of his empire.<br> If he gets out now, he knows<br> he'll never get back again.<br> -I wonder who will.<br> -No one will.<br> Arabia's for the Arabs now.<br> That's what I've<br> told them anyway.<br> That's what they think.<br> -That's why they're fighting.<br> -Oh, surely.<br> They've only one suspicion.<br> That we'll let them drive the Turks<br> out and then move in ourselves.<br> I've told them that that's false,<br> that we have no ambitions in Arabia.<br> Have we?<br> I'm not a politician, thank God.<br> Have we any ambition<br> in Arabia, Dryden?<br> Difficult question, sir.<br> I want to know, sir, if I can<br> tell them in your name<br> that we've no<br> ambitions in Arabia.<br> Certainly.<br> enough. I need five.<br> Right.<br> Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.<br> They don't like paper.<br> Right.<br> -Instructors for the Lewis guns.<br> -Right.<br> More money.<br> -How much more?<br> -25,000 now. A lot more later.<br> -Dryden?<br> -It can be done, sir.<br> A couple of<br> armoured cars.<br> Right.<br> Field artillery.<br> Right.<br> I'm going to give you every blessed<br> thing I can, Major Lawrence,<br> because I know you'll use it.<br> Congratulations and thank you.<br> Thank you for your<br> hospitality, gentlemen.<br> Congratulations!<br> Are you really going to give<br> them artillery, sir?<br> I was wondering that, sir.<br> Might be deuced difficult<br> to get it back again.<br> Give them artillery and<br> you've made them independent.<br> Then I can't give<br> them artillery, can I?<br> -For you to say, sir.<br> -No, it's not.<br> I've got orders<br> to obey, thank God.<br> Not like that<br> poor devil.<br> He's riding<br> the whirlwind.<br> Let's hope we're not.<br> Excuse me, friend.<br> Who do these bags belong to?<br> To Prince Feisal.<br> You're not Prince Feisal<br> by any chance?<br> -No.<br> -You know him though?<br> He is my master.<br> I am his servant.<br> Um, can you read?<br> The Chicago Courier is my own<br> particular paper, but my work<br> is syndicated throughout America.<br> I understood so from<br> your letter, Mr. Bentley.<br> Now...<br> -Where can I find Major Lawrence?<br> -Is that what you have come for?<br> Not altogether, sir, no.<br> Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find<br> Major Lawrence with my army.<br> That's what I meant, sir.<br> Where can I find your army?<br> I don't know.<br> -Last week they were near El Ghira.<br> -Ghira?<br> Oh, yes, I fear you have a long journey.<br> Can you ride a camel?<br> -I've never tried.<br> -Take a mule.<br> Avoid Mellaha,<br> the Turks are there.<br> In Mellaha now?<br> They move fast.<br> They do.<br> But not so fast as we do,<br> you will find.<br> Myself...<br> I am going to Cairo.<br> -As you know.<br> -Yes.<br> There's work for me<br> there of a different kind.<br> Yes.<br> I understand you've<br> been given no artillery.<br> -That is so.<br> -You're handicapped?<br> It restricts us<br> to small things.<br> It's intended to.<br> Do you know<br> General Allenby?<br> Watch out for Allenby.<br> He's a slim customer.<br> -Excuse me?<br> -A clever man.<br> Slim customer.<br> It's very good.<br> I'll certainly watch out for him.<br> You're being very sympathetic, Mr. Bentley.<br> Your Highness, we Americans<br> were once a colonial people,<br> and we naturally feel<br> sympathetic to any people<br> anywhere who are struggling<br> for their freedom.<br> Very gratifying.<br> Also, my interests are the same<br> as yours. You want your story told.<br> I badly want a story to tell.<br> Ah, now you are talking<br> turkey, are you not?<br> Well, Mr. Bentley, I will give<br> you a guide and a letter.<br> And before I leave here,<br> ah, which must be presently,<br> I will have some facts and<br> figures put on paper for you.<br> You know, of course, that we are<br> destroying the Turkish railways.<br> I do, sir.<br> Major Lawrence is in charge<br> of all this, is he?<br> My army is made up of tribes.<br> The tribes are led<br> by the tribal leaders.<br> Well, your people do think very<br> highly of Major Lawrence, though?<br> Oh, yes. And the rightly.<br> In this country, Mr. Bentley...<br> the man who gives victory<br> in battle is prized<br> beyond every other man.<br> One figure I can give you<br> from my head,<br> because it never<br> leaves my head.<br> Since starting this campaign<br> four months ago, we have lost...<br> You remark the disproportion<br> between our dead and wounded.<br> Yeah.<br> Four times as many.<br> That's because those too badly wounded<br> to bring away, we ourselves kill.<br> We leave no wounded<br> for the Turks.<br> You mean?<br> I mean we leave<br> no wounded for the Turks.<br> In their eyes, we are<br> not soldiers but rebels.<br> And rebels, wounded or whole,<br> are not protected by the Geneva Code<br> and are treated harshly.<br> How harshly?<br> More harshly than<br> I hope you can imagine.<br> I see.<br> Our own prisoners, Mr. Bentley,<br> are taken care of until the British<br> can relieve us of them,<br> according to the Code.<br> -I should like you to notice that.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Is that the influence<br> of Major Lawrence?<br> Why should you<br> suppose so?<br> Well, it's just that<br> I heard in Cairo that<br> Major Lawrence has<br> a horror of bloodshed.<br> That is exactly so.<br> With Major Lawrence,<br> mercy is a passion.<br> With me, it is merely<br> good manners.<br> You may judge which<br> motive is the more reliable.<br> -And now, perhaps...<br> -Oh, sure, sure.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Do you think you'd be able<br> to manage the letter...?<br> I'll do everything<br> I have said, Mr. Bentley,<br> if you will tell me truly<br> the nature of your interest<br> in my people and<br> Major Lawrence.<br> It's very simple, sir.<br> I'm looking for a hero.<br> Indeed? You do not<br> seem a romantic man.<br> Oh, no.<br> But certain influential men back home<br> believe that the time has come for America<br> to lend her weight to the patriotic<br> struggle against Germany.<br> And Turkey.<br> Now, I've been sent to find material which<br> will show our people that this war is...<br> -Enjoyable?<br> -Oh, hardly that, sir.<br> But to show it in its more<br> adventurous aspects.<br> You are looking for a figure who will<br> draw your country towards war.<br> All right. Yes.<br> Aurens is your man.<br> Stop!<br> Stop it!<br> Stop it!<br> Come on, men!<br> Aurens!<br> Good, good, good!<br> Jiminy! Never seen a man<br> killed with a sword before.<br> Why don't you<br> take a picture?<br> Wish I had.<br> How is it with thee, Aurens?<br> -Am I in this?<br> -Huh?<br> Did you take his picture?<br> Yeah.<br> You are using up your<br> nine lives very quickly.<br> Charming company you keep.<br> Auda?<br> He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks<br> these things will steal his virtue.<br> He thinks you're<br> a kind of thief.<br> It's all right<br> if I take your picture?<br> -All right.<br> -Okay.<br> Just walk.<br> Aurens! Aurens!<br> Aurens! Aurens!<br> Aurens! Aurens!<br> Aurens! Aurens!<br> Aurens! Aurens! Aurens!<br> Major Lawrence!<br> Yes, sir, that's my baby.<br> This looting<br> has got to stop!<br> It is customary.<br> It's theft. And theft<br> makes thieves.<br> I would not say that to Auda.<br> -It is their payment, colonel.<br> -Payment.<br> Truly. Are not British<br> soldiers paid?<br> They don't go home<br> when they've been paid.<br> They are not free to.<br> Well, there's another lot<br> you've seen the last of.<br> They'll come back.<br> He says they'll come<br> back. Will they?<br> Not this year,<br> Aurens.<br> Look, Lawrence, how many men<br> do you think you'll have left? 200?<br> -Less.<br> -Well, then?<br> I said, they'll come back.<br> You badly hurt?<br> Not hurt at all.<br> Didn't you know? They can only<br> kill me with a golden bullet.<br> It is for children.<br> I have set myself to learn again.<br> -What are you learning from this?<br> -Politics.<br> You gonna be a democracy in this country?<br> You gonna have a parliament?<br> I will tell you that<br> when I have a country.<br> Did I answer well?<br> You answered without saying<br> anything. That's politics.<br> You learn quickly.<br> -I have a good teacher.<br> -Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> -How's your hurt?<br> -Fine.<br> Before I return to the fleshpots,<br> which I shall be very glad to do,<br> may I put two questions<br> to you, straight?<br> I'd be interested to hear you put<br> a question straight, Mr. Bentley.<br> One.<br> What, in your opinion, do these people<br> hope to gain from this war?<br> They hope to<br> gain their freedom.<br> Freedom.<br> "They hope to gain their freedom."<br> -There's one born every minute.<br> -They're going to get it, Mr. Bentley.<br> I'm going to give it to them.<br> -The second question?<br> -Well, I was going to ask, um...<br> What is it, Major Lawrence, that<br> attracts you personally to the desert?<br> It's clean.<br> Well, now...<br> that's a very illuminating answer.<br> May I...<br> take one farewell picture?<br> I gave Math Budad<br> two lamps for it.<br> One clock for two lamps.<br> ALl:<br> A fair bargain.<br> Fair? I robbed him.<br> Trash.<br> I must find<br> something honourable.<br> Honourable?<br> Yes. The year is<br> running out, Brighton.<br> I must find something honourable.<br> Now you may<br> blow up my train.<br> And what will you do now?<br> Now I go home.<br> They will carry my toys.<br> They will carry my toys too,<br> do you see?<br> Major Lawrence will<br> campaign this winter.<br> But you got what you wanted,<br> so you're going home, is that it?<br> Of course. When Aurens has got<br> what he wants, he will go home.<br> When you've got what<br> you want, you will go home.<br> Oh, no, I shan't, Auda.<br> Then you are a fool.<br> Maybe. But I am not a deserter.<br> Give thanks to God, Brighton,<br> that when he made you a fool,<br> he gave you a fool's face.<br> You are an impudent rascal.<br> I must go, Aurens, before I soil<br> myself with a fool's blood.<br> Like talking to a brick wall.<br> So, what will you do now?<br> What can you do?<br> I'll go north.<br> That's what Allenby<br> wants, isn't it?<br> Allenby wanted the Arab army<br> behind Deraa.<br> Then that's where I'll take it.<br> Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be<br> in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.<br> Won't we?<br> Train, Farraj.<br> Yeah, Aurens.<br> Hide yourself, my friend.<br> Detonator.<br> All right, fetch another.<br> -Pardon, Aurens. I put...<br> -There's plenty of time. Fetch another.<br> Farraj?<br> Farraj!<br> -What happened?<br> -Detonator. A detonator!<br> He cannot ride,<br> Aurens. Look.<br> If they take him alive,<br> you know what they'll do to him.<br> Daud will be angry with you.<br> Salute him for me.<br> What will you do now?<br> Go north.<br> With twenty?<br> What would you<br> recommend me to do, Ali?<br> What would you recommend?<br> Well, he hasn't one-tenth<br> so many men, sir.<br> He's lied, in fact.<br> Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have<br> done anything he hasn't done.<br> Then there is an<br> Arab north army.<br> -No, sir, he has lied about that.<br> -Any idea why?<br> -It's his army, I suppose.<br> -It's Prince Feisal's army.<br> Do you think he's<br> gone native, Harry?<br> No.<br> He would if he<br> could, I think.<br> -Not my line of country, this, sir.<br> -It doesn't matter. I'm just curious.<br> What matters is<br> I believed it.<br> The Turks believe it.<br> They are offering<br> Good heavens.<br> Shouldn't say he had<br> long to live, would you?<br> Well, whatever else,<br> sir, he's a brave man...<br> Surely, surely. If he's still going<br> north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.<br> I wonder if they'd<br> offer that much for me.<br> What about next year?<br> Will they still come back?<br> I wouldn't be surprised.<br> -They think he's a kind of prophet.<br> -They do or he does?<br> -Now may I speak?<br> -Yes.<br> Aurens, one more failure<br> and you will find yourself alone.<br> -I do not include myself.<br> -I do not include the others.<br> So say they love you.<br> The more reason to<br> be thrifty with them.<br> Give them something to do<br> that can be done. But you, no.<br> They must move mountains for you,<br> they must walk on water.<br> That's right. That's right.<br> Who are you to know<br> what can be done?<br> If we'd done what you thought could be done,<br> we'd be back in Yenbo now and nowhere.<br> Whatever I ask them to do can be done.<br> That's all. They know that if you don't.<br> Do you think I'm just anybody, Ali?<br> Do you?<br> My friends, who will<br> walk on water with me?<br> -Who will come with me into Deraa?<br> -Deraa is garrisoned.<br> Will you take 20 against 2000?<br> -I'll go by myself if I have to.<br> -Why?<br> Because I told the<br> English generals<br> the Arab revolt would be in Deraa<br> when they'd be in Jerusalem.<br> Or perhaps you are here...<br> for the English generals.<br> Who says this?<br> Rumour.<br> That is not an argument.<br> Oh, argument.<br> This afternoon I will take<br> the Arab revolt into Deraa<br> while the Arabs argue.<br> Aurens.<br> Can you pass for an Arab<br> in an Arab town?<br> Yes. If one of you would lend<br> me some dirty clothes.<br> It's madness.<br> What are you looking for?<br> Some way to<br> announce myself.<br> Be patient with him, God.<br> Do you not see how<br> they look at you? Come.<br> Peace, Ali, I am invisible.<br> Halt!<br> Walk on.<br> -Halt!<br> -Walk on.<br> You and you.<br> You.<br> You.<br> You have blue eyes.<br> -I say you have blue eyes.<br> -Yes, effendi.<br> -Are you Circassian?<br> -Yes, effendi.<br> How old are you?<br> Twenty-seven, effendi.<br> I think.<br> You look older. You have<br> had a lot of experience.<br> It's an interesting face.<br> I am surrounded by cattle.<br> He wouldn't know an interesting<br> face from a sow's belly.<br> I have been in Deraa now<br> for three and a half years.<br> If they posted me to the dark side<br> of the moon, I could not be more...<br> isolated.<br> You haven't the least idea<br> what I'm talking about, have you?<br> No, effendi.<br> Have you?<br> No.<br> That would be too...<br> lucky.<br> Where did you get that?<br> -Oh, it's old, effendi.<br> -No, no, this is recent.<br> -You are a deserter.<br> -No, effendi.<br> Yes, you are a deserter.<br> But from which army?<br> Not that it matters at all.<br> A man cannot be always in uniform.<br> Your skin is very fair.<br> Beat him.<br> To me!<br> Sleep.<br> Sleep.<br> Eat.<br> Eat.<br> You have a body,<br> like other men.<br> Good.<br> Then sleep.<br> Better?<br> Much better.<br> You were right.<br> Rest, rest.<br> Can you not learn?<br> Oh, I've learned all right.<br> I'm going, Ali.<br> -Why?<br> -Why?<br> Heavens.<br> Why?<br> I've come to the end<br> of myself, I suppose.<br> And the end of<br> the Arab revolt?<br> I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.<br> I'm not even Arab.<br> A man can be whatever<br> he wants. You said.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought it was true.<br> You proved it.<br> Look, Ali. Look.<br> That's me. What colour<br> is it? That's me.<br> And there's nothing<br> I can do about it.<br> A man can do whatever<br> he wants. You said.<br> He can...<br> but he can't want<br> what he wants.<br> This is the stuff that<br> decides what he wants.<br> You may as well know.<br> I would've told them anything.<br> I would've told them who I am.<br> I would've told them where you were.<br> -I tried to.<br> -So would any man.<br> Well, any man<br> is what I am.<br> And I'm going back to Allenby<br> to ask him for a job<br> that any man can do.<br> Allenby's in Jerusalem.<br> -I'll make easy stages.<br> -You?<br> Oh, yes. Easy stages.<br> Look, Ali, I think I see<br> a way of being just<br> ordinarily...<br> happy.<br> Can I take this?<br> It is not clean.<br> No, but it's warm.<br> And these...<br> having led them here,<br> have you no care for them?<br> You lead them. They're yours.<br> Trust your own people.<br> And let me go back to mine.<br> -I say, don't forget those form fives.<br> -All right.<br> Hey.<br> -Mind if I join you?<br> -Oh.<br> Honoured, sir.<br> -Good to be back.<br> -We heard you were, sir.<br> -What's doing out there?<br> -Where?<br> -Oh, Arabia?<br> -Well, yes, sir.<br> Nothing much. Wrong time of year.<br> What's doing here?<br> We're settling in all right, sir.<br> We built a squash court.<br> Jolly good.<br> Well, I have to go up there.<br> It's borrowed.<br> Someone pinched mine.<br> Bloody wogs.<br> Yes, probably.<br> Jolly good about the squash court.<br> Lays it on a bit thick,<br> doesn't he?<br> Morning.<br> -Good morning, sir.<br> -Good to be back.<br> -I'll believe you, sir.<br> -No, really, it is.<br> Hello.<br> Morning.<br> You're to go right in.<br> Aurens.<br> Or is it Major Lawrence?<br> -Sir.<br> -Ah.<br> Well, general,<br> I will leave you.<br> Major Lawrence doubtless<br> has reports to make<br> about my people<br> and their weakness<br> and the need to keep them<br> weak in the British interest.<br> And the French interest too, of course.<br> We must not forget the French.<br> I told you, sir,<br> no such treaty exists.<br> Yes, general, you have lied most<br> bravely, but not convincingly.<br> I know this treaty<br> does exist.<br> Treaty, sir?<br> He does it better<br> than you, general.<br> But then, of course,<br> he is almost an Arab.<br> You really don't know?<br> Then what the devil's this?<br> It's my request for release<br> from Arabia, sir.<br> For what reason? Are you sure you<br> haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?<br> No.<br> -I can guess.<br> -Don't guess. Tell him.<br> Well, now...<br> Mr. Sykes is an<br> English civil servant.<br> Monsieur Picot is<br> a French civil servant.<br> Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,<br> and they agreed that after the war,<br> France and England should<br> share the Turkish Empire.<br> Including Arabia.<br> They signed an agreement,<br> not a treaty, sir.<br> An agreement<br> to that effect.<br> There may be honour among thieves,<br> but there's none in politicians.<br> And let's have no displays<br> of indignation.<br> You may not have known, but<br> you certainly had suspicions.<br> If we've told lies,<br> you've told half-lies.<br> And a man who tells lies,<br> like me, merely hides the truth.<br> But a man who tells half-lies<br> has forgotten where he put it.<br> The truth is, I'm an ordinary man.<br> You might have told me that, Dryden.<br> And I want an ordinary job, sir.<br> That's my reason<br> for resigning.<br> It's personal.<br> -Personal?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Personal? You're a<br> serving officer in the field.<br> And as it happens, a damned<br> important one. Personal? Are you mad?<br> No, and if you don't mind,<br> I'd rather not go mad.<br> That's my reason too.<br> Look, Lawrence, I'm making my big push<br> on Damascus the 16th of next month,<br> and you are part of it.<br> Can you understand that? You're<br> an important part of the big push!<br> I don't want to be part<br> of your big push!<br> What about your Arab friends?<br> What about them?<br> I have no Arab friends!<br> I don't want Arab friends!<br> What in hell do you want, Lawrence?<br> I've told you, I just want<br> my ration of common humanity.<br> -Lawrence.<br> -Yes?<br> Nothing. Sorry<br> I interrupted, sir.<br> That's quite all right.<br> Thank you, Mr. Dryden.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Why don't we?<br> There's blood<br> on your back.<br> -Do you want a doctor?<br> -No.<br> Tell me what happened.<br> Say, what goes on in there?<br> -Nothing.<br> -Oh, come on!<br> -No, really. Nothing at all.<br> -Is the man in trouble?<br> I expect so. We all have troubles.<br> Life's a vale of troubles.<br> Just let me know if the man's in trouble.<br> I've got an interest in that man. I've got a claim.<br> What claim?<br> You've read my stuff.<br> I've made that boy a hero.<br> When the war's over, that boy<br> can be anything he wants.<br> Yes. Well, at the moment<br> he wants to be somebody else.<br> Will you kindly<br> allow me to pass?<br> Walk away, Dryden,<br> walk away.<br> Always walking<br> away, aren't you?<br> Well, I'll tell you.<br> It's a little clash of temperament<br> that's going on in there.<br> Inevitably, one of<br> them's half-mad<br> and the other,<br> wholly unscrupulous.<br> I believe your name will<br> be a household word,<br> when you'd have to go to the war<br> museum to find who Allenby was.<br> You're the most extraordinary man<br> I ever met.<br> Leave me alone.<br> -Leave me alone.<br> -That's a feeble thing to say.<br> -I know I'm not ordinary.<br> -That's not what I'm saying.<br> All right,<br> I'm extraordinary.<br> What of it?<br> Not many people have<br> a destiny, Lawrence.<br> It's a terrible thing for a<br> man to flunk it if he has.<br> Are you speaking<br> from experience?<br> No.<br> You're guessing, then.<br> Suppose you're wrong.<br> Why suppose that?<br> We both know I'm right.<br> -Yes. I said, yes.<br> -After all...<br> -The 16th?<br> -Can you do it?<br> I'll give you a lot of money.<br> -Artillery?<br> -I can't.<br> They won't be coming for<br> money, not the best of them.<br> They'll be coming for Damascus.<br> Which I'm going to give them.<br> That's all I want.<br> All you want is someone<br> holding down the Turkish Right.<br> But I'm going to give them Damascus.<br> We'll get there before you do.<br> And when we've got it,<br> we'll keep it.<br> You can tell the politicians<br> to burn their bit of paper now.<br> Fair enough.<br> Fair? What's fair<br> got to do with it?<br> It's going to happen.<br> I shall want quite<br> a lot of money.<br> All there is.<br> Not that much.<br> The best of them<br> won't come for money.<br> They'll come for me.<br> No pictures!<br> You take no pictures.<br> It's not for you, Sheik Auda,<br> it's for Major Lawrence.<br> He doesn't mind having his picture<br> taken. He doesn't mind at all.<br> Well, there's<br> only one Aurens.<br> Have you met Major Lawrence<br> since he's come back, sherif?<br> Yes.<br> -Changed, hasn't he?<br> -No.<br> Oh, I'd say he had.<br> Different man, I'd say.<br> Aurens! Aurens!<br> What did that Turkish general<br> do to him in Deraa?<br> He was the same man after Deraa.<br> The same man, humbled.<br> What did the English general<br> do to him in Jerusalem?<br> Search me.<br> Ask Aurens.<br> -I did.<br> -What did he say?<br> He laughed.<br> He told me to gather<br> the Harith here.<br> He offered me money.<br> Did you take it?<br> No. But many did.<br> -What is this?<br> -This is my bodyguard.<br> There is not a man there<br> without a price on his head.<br> -There's a price on my head too.<br> -But these are murderers.<br> You know, the sheiks<br> will hang these men.<br> These men are mine.<br> Aurens, these things know<br> nothing of the Arab revolt.<br> -You, Ghitan of Aleppo.<br> -Sherif?<br> -Where do we ride?<br> -Damascus, sherif.<br> Aye, but for what?<br> Sherif, for Aurens.<br> -You have bought these things.<br> -I bought half the men here, Ali.<br> That is different.<br> These are not ordinary men.<br> I don't want<br> ordinary men. Hut!<br> Damascus!<br> Damascus! Damascus!<br> Damascus! Damascus!<br> Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's<br> gone through Mazril and Deraa.<br> Very good, by the way. Very<br> good indeed. Now your turn.<br> If the enemy's retreating<br> in any kind of order,<br> which we'd better assume...<br> Certainly.<br> He can't be far from<br> this Mallud place...<br> in which case I can have him within<br> range by 0900 hours tomorrow.<br> Splendid. Philip.<br> Well, these are the last infantry<br> supports going up now, sir.<br> But Mallud, we could have<br> the fusiliers there by Wednesday.<br> That'll do for now.<br> The guns are what matter.<br> Any questions?<br> This Arab army on the<br> right, sir, what's it consist of?<br> Irregular cavalry,<br> sir. About 2000.<br> Where are they now?<br> Can only know that by<br> being with them, sir.<br> Then get with them,<br> Harry. I want to know.<br> Pound them, Charley.<br> Pound them.<br> God help the men<br> who lie under that.<br> They're Turks.<br> God help them.<br> Well, he's got the bit<br> between his teeth all right.<br> Cocky?<br> More than cocky, sir.<br> He's got the bit<br> between his teeth all right.<br> I tell you, sir, I think<br> he'll get to Damascus before we do.<br> -Unless...<br> -Unless?<br> Well, there's a Turkish column<br> in front of him, out of Mazril.<br> -What do the Turks have in Mazril?<br> -A brigade, sir.<br> I wonder where they are now.<br> Hut.<br> No prisoners.<br> Damascus, Aurens.<br> Aurens, not this.<br> Go round. Damascus,<br> Aurens, Damascus.<br> No prisoners.<br> Aurens.<br> This was Talaal's village.<br> Talaal!<br> Talaal!<br> No prisoners!<br> No prisoners!<br> God.<br> God.<br> God!<br> Aurens!<br> Aurens!<br> Aurens!<br> Aurens.<br> Enough. Enough!<br> Make them stop!<br> Aurens.<br> Aurens.<br> Aurens.<br> Major!<br> Major Lawrence!<br> Jesus wept.<br> Jesus wept.<br> ALl:<br> Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?<br> Surely you know the Arabs<br> are a barbarous people.<br> Barbarous and cruel.<br> Who but they?<br> Who but they?<br> Oh, you rotten man.<br> Here, let me take<br> your rotten bloody picture.<br> For the rotten bloody newspapers.<br> These were cut last night,<br> Aurens, in Damascus.<br> Damascus!<br> Take them to Sherif Ali.<br> Tell him.<br> Remind him.<br> -Is Allenby in Damascus?<br> -Near.<br> Tell Sherif Ali that.<br> They are not ripe.<br> General salute!<br> Present...<br> arms!<br> Port arms!<br> Lawrence is<br> behind it, sir.<br> The whole town is<br> plastered with the Arab flag.<br> -When?<br> -A day and a night, sir.<br> They've been here<br> a day and a night.<br> They've occupied the<br> town, sir. They've done it.<br> He's set up his own headquarters<br> in the town hall.<br> What else beside<br> the town hall?<br> Telephone exchange,<br> post office, powerhouse,<br> hospitals, fire station.<br> Everything, sir.<br> They call themselves<br> the Arab National Council,<br> and they're in<br> the town hall.<br> Well, they're your<br> pigeon, Harry.<br> What do you think<br> we should we do about it?<br> Well, get them out of it,<br> sir, quick time.<br> How about that, Dryden?<br> Not unless you want a full-scale<br> rising on your hands.<br> -Well, what, then?<br> -When will Feisal be in Damascus?<br> By special train<br> in two days' time.<br> Two days.<br> Two days is what you asked me for.<br> I can't keep him out any longer.<br> -Isn't it enough?<br> -Yes.<br> -Ample, I should think.<br> -Look, sir, we can't just do nothing.<br> Why not? It's usually best.<br> Get us something to drink, Tracey.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And, Tracey, all troops to remain<br> quartered until further orders.<br> Yes, sir. Does that apply<br> to technical units, sir?<br> Technical units particularly.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Medicals too, sir?<br> I'm afraid so, Harry.<br> Medicals too.<br> We here<br> are neither Harith nor Howeitat,<br> nor any other tribe, but Arabs<br> of the Arab Council,<br> acting for Prince Feisal.<br> He insulted me.<br> Sherif Ali said that the telephones<br> are in the care of the Howeitat<br> and that the telephones have ceased<br> to work. And this is true, Auda.<br> They will not work because<br> they are given no electricity.<br> The electricity is<br> in the care of the Harith.<br> If you answer,<br> there will be bloodshed.<br> You speak to me<br> of bloodshed?<br> I ask pardon<br> of Auda Abu Tayi.<br> Humbly?<br> Humbly, Harith?<br> Yes, humbly.<br> This is a new trick.<br> Why is there no electricity?<br> I have been to that<br> electrical house, Aurens.<br> There are three large machines.<br> He means generators!<br> So.<br> One of them is burning.<br> They are of an incredible size,<br> but helpless.<br> It is so of all machines.<br> Let them burn.<br> What need of telephones?<br> -The need is absolute.<br> -Then we need the English engineers.<br> No. Take English engineers<br> and you take English government.<br> Take...<br> Fire has broken out.<br> -Where?<br> -The Jinsibi district.<br> -It is not a district that matters.<br> -It will spread!<br> Then in God's name,<br> use the fire brigade!<br> We have tried, but there<br> is no force in the water.<br> Then you must carry it.<br> -The Ruala do not carry water.<br> -What else are they good for?<br> We will hear petitions this afternoon.<br> This afternoon!<br> -I'm gonna take this up after the war.<br> -Surely we should do something, sir.<br> -It's an old man's sport.<br> -Are you an old man, sir?<br> Well, all I can say is, sir,<br> it's a heavy responsibility.<br> Sorry, sir.<br> Maybe it's the bulb.<br> No, sir.<br> It's the power.<br> They're leaving, sir.<br> That's it, then.<br> Marvellous-looking<br> beggars, aren't they?<br> Leave it, Aurens.<br> Come with me.<br> -Come where?<br> -Back.<br> I know your heart.<br> What is it?<br> Is it this?<br> I tell you, this is nothing.<br> Is it the blood?<br> The desert has dried up more<br> blood than you could think of.<br> I pray that I may never<br> see the desert again.<br> Hear me, God.<br> You will come. There is<br> only the desert for you.<br> What about you, Ali?<br> No, I shall stay here<br> and learn politics.<br> That's a very low occupation.<br> I had not thought of it<br> when I met you.<br> You have tried very hard<br> to give us Damascus.<br> It's what I came for.<br> And then...<br> it would be something.<br> Yes.<br> Much.<br> -He is your friend?<br> -Take your hand away.<br> -You love him.<br> -No, I fear him.<br> Then why do you weep?<br> If I fear him,<br> who love him,<br> how must he fear himself,<br> who hates himself?<br> Take your hand<br> away, Howeitat!<br> Oh...<br> So you are not yet<br> entirely politician.<br> Not yet.<br> Well, these are new tricks,<br> and I am an old dog.<br> And Allah be thanked.<br> I'll tell thee what, though,<br> being an Arab will be thornier<br> than you suppose, Harith.<br> In all my years as a medical officer,<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> It comes within the jurisdiction<br> of the Arab Council.<br> I'm sorry, sir. Under the circumstances,<br> I think I must take over. Immediately.<br> Under any circumstances at all,<br> you must obey your orders.<br> No, sir, I will not.<br> Control yourself.<br> Now, go over to the town hall<br> and see what they say.<br> We did what we could<br> in the civic hospitals.<br> But you forgot the Turkish<br> Military Hospital.<br> Yes.<br> It has 600 beds. There are about<br> All of whom are the responsibility<br> of your precious Arab Council.<br> What's it like?<br> This is outrageous!<br> Outrageous!<br> Outrageous!<br> You filthy little wog!<br> My friend Aurens,<br> if I may call him that.<br> "My friend Aurens."<br> How many men will claim the right<br> to use that phrase? How proudly.<br> He longs for the greenness<br> of his native land.<br> He pines for the Gothic<br> cottages of Surrey, is it not?<br> Already in imagination,<br> he catches trout<br> and all the activities<br> of the English gentleman.<br> That's me you're describing,<br> sir, not Colonel Lawrence.<br> You're promoted colonel.<br> Yes. What for?<br> Take the honour, colonel.<br> Be a little kind.<br> As a colonel, you'll have a cabin<br> to yourself on the boat home.<br> Then, thank you.<br> Well, then...<br> Godspeed.<br> There's nothing further<br> here for a warrior.<br> We drive bargains.<br> Old men's work.<br> Young men make wars, and the virtues<br> of war are the virtues of young men.<br> Courage and hope for the future.<br> Then old men make the peace.<br> And the vices of peace<br> are the vices of old men.<br> Mistrust and caution.<br> It must be so.<br> What I owe you is beyond evaluation.<br> The powerhouse, the telephone<br> exchange, these I concede.<br> The pumping plant<br> I must retain.<br> If you retain the pumping plant,<br> there will be no water, sir.<br> I shall be glad of<br> any technical assistance.<br> In fairness, then, you<br> must bring down your flag.<br> I shall not bring down my flag,<br> and if your men attempt it,<br> my men will resist it.<br> -Have you any men, sir?<br> -Enough of that.<br> It's the kind of thing that<br> makes a very ugly incident.<br> I'm sure your government<br> does not wish to appear at the peace<br> conference in the light of an aggressor.<br> I say!<br> It's Lawrence, isn't it?<br> Well...<br> May I shake your hand, sir?<br> Just want to be able<br> to say I'd done it, sir.<br> Haven't we met before?<br> Don't think so, sir.<br> No, no, sir, I should<br> remember that.<br> It is widely known the Arab Council<br> took power in my name.<br> They have no power, sir.<br> It's illusory.<br> Illusions can be<br> very powerful.<br> Particularly...<br> when they take this form.<br> The world is delighted<br> at the picture of Damascus<br> liberated by the Arab army.<br> Led, may I remind you, sir,<br> by a British-serving officer.<br> Ah, yes. But then Aurens<br> is a sword with two edges.<br> We are equally glad<br> to be rid of him, are we not?<br> I thought I was a hard man, sir.<br> You are merely a general.<br> I...<br> must be a king.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Well?<br> Well...<br> it seems we're to have<br> a British waterworks<br> with an Arab flag on it.<br> Do you think it was worth it?<br> Not my business.<br> Thank God I'm a soldier.<br> Yes, sir.<br> So you keep saying.<br> You, I suspect,<br> are chief architect<br> of this compromise.<br> -What do you think?<br> -Me, Your Highness?<br> On the whole, I wish<br> I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.<br> Well, sir. Going home.<br> -Hm?<br> -Home, sir.<br> # Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you #<br> # Though it breaks my heart to go #<br>
