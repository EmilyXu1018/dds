                        It's good to see you, Dick.<br> It's good to be back.<br> Everything has been arranged.<br> She's up there waiting for you.<br> Thank you.<br> Poor, dear man.<br> I... I guess I'll be going now.<br> Good luck to you, Dick.<br> Been through hell, hasn't he?<br> To a man like that,<br> two years in prison is worse than hell.<br> Isn't that Dick Harland, the chap<br> who used to live in Back of the Moon?<br> Yes, I believe it is.<br> Well, of all the seven deadly sins,<br> jealousy is the most deadly.<br> Oh, will you bring us<br> some coffee, please?<br> - You were his lawyer, weren't you?<br> - Yes, I defended him.<br> Some might say<br> I lost the case for him.<br> I read the newspapers, but I never<br> could make head nor taiI of it.<br> Well...<br> ...there's some things that<br> couldn't be told in the courtroom.<br> Yet, of all the people involved...<br> ...I suppose I'm the only one<br> who knew the whole story.<br> You see, it was through me<br> they first met.<br> He'd been working very hard<br> on a new book.<br> I invited him up to my place<br> in New Mexico for a rest.<br> They met on the train.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're quite welcome.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I was staring at you, wasn't I?<br> I didn't mean to, really.<br> It's only because...<br> Because you look so much<br> like my father.<br> When he was younger,<br> of course, your age.<br> A most remarkable resemblance.<br> For a moment I thought...<br> Do forgive me.<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I was doing quite a bit of staring myself.<br> And I assure you it's not because<br> you look like my mother.<br> In fact, I can't say you look like<br> anyone I've ever met before.<br> Then why did you stare?<br> - Do you want to know?<br> - If it's not too unflattering.<br> Now, you know perfectly well<br> that nothing I could say about you...<br> The way you look, I mean,<br> could be anything but flattering.<br> - Of course, if you don't like flattery...<br> - But I do.<br> On second thought,<br> it won't be flattery.<br> It'll be the truth<br> and nothing but the truth.<br> Any resemblance to flattery<br> will be sheer coincidence.<br> - Shall I proceed?<br> - Proceed.<br> While I was watching you, exotic words<br> drifted across the mirror of my mind...<br> ...as summer clouds<br> drift across the sky.<br> Mmm.<br> - Couldn't you be a bit more specific?<br> - I'll try.<br> Watching you, I thought of tales<br> in the Arabian Nights...<br> ...of myrrh and frankincense and....<br> - And patchouli?<br> - Patchouli, that's it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I knew it. Here it is. I quote:<br> "As he watched her, exotic words<br> drifted across the mirror of his mind.<br> He thought of tales<br> in the Arabian Nights...<br> ...of myrrh and frankincense<br> and patchouli. " Unquote.<br> - So that's where it came from.<br> - Oh, I guess so. But really, I wasn't...<br> I give you my word,<br> it's weeks since I read it.<br> - It must've impressed you enormously.<br> - The book? Not particularly.<br> - Rather a sloppy job, I thought.<br> - I agree with you.<br> You do?<br> Next stop, Jacinto.<br> Next stop, Jacinto.<br> Oh, that's me.<br> Jacinto. That's me.<br> Oh, there you are. Hello there.<br> Oh, it's nice to see you.<br> - Mrs. Berent.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Hello, baby, how are you?<br> Hello, darling.<br> - And how's Louise?<br> Fine.<br> - And the children?<br> - Fine, wonderfuI.<br> Get those bags, will you?<br> - Looking forward to seeing the ranch.<br> - Can you stay long?<br> Here! Here we are!<br> Hello there.<br> Hello, Glen, how are you?<br> Nice to see you.<br> - Glad to see you, Dick.<br> - You look fine.<br> - How's your brother?<br> - Danny's still flat on his back.<br> He wanted very much to come...<br> ...but the doctor thought the trip<br> might be too much.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Ladies, may I present Mr. Harland?<br> Mrs. Berent.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Ruth Berent.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello.<br> Ellen Berent.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> We met on the train, rather briefly.<br> Too briefly.<br> I've got the car right here, folks.<br> Are you all ready? Come on.<br> - Did you say Harland?<br> - Richard Harland.<br> Oh, Mr. Harland, I'm terribly sorry.<br> I doubt if I'll ever forgive you.<br> Wait till you get a look<br> at the new colts.<br> Oh, I bet they're darling.<br> Ellen, we've got plenty<br> of wild turkey this year.<br> WonderfuI.<br> - Big as ostriches, twice as ornery.<br> Hope you people<br> are all good and hungry.<br> - Here we are.<br> - Mom, they're here! They're here!<br> - Welcome to Rancho Jacinto.<br> Thank you, Glen.<br> - Mother, isn't it wonderfuI?<br> - It's beautifuI.<br> Ruth.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> Margaret.<br> I did want to come to meet you...<br> ...but I thought it best to stay here<br> to supervise dinner.<br> - Ellen, how are you?<br> - How are you?<br> Dick, it's so good seeing you.<br> But where's Danny?<br> - He couldn't quite make it, Louise.<br> - Oh, I'm terribly sorry.<br> - Is he still at Warm Springs?<br> - Yes, he's getting along fine.<br> Oh, good.<br> You'll probably want to change.<br> Come on, I'll show you your room.<br> Those trout<br> were in the stream hours ago.<br> - You couldn't get that in Boston.<br> Perhaps, but our codfish...<br> I was born and raised<br> in Boston myself.<br> I yield to no one<br> in my passion for codfish.<br> - I hate codfish.<br> - So do I.<br> - Children, that's rank disloyalty.<br> - It's treason.<br> Mr. Harland, what do you think?<br> Mrs. Robie,<br> I'm what you call a salmon man.<br> Fact of the matter is Mother<br> just doesn't like New Mexico.<br> Since this is my first visit, I don't see<br> how you can say such a thing.<br> It's true just the same.<br> Father and I used to come here<br> every spring, year after year.<br> And occasionally Ruth came along,<br> but never Mother.<br> Too bad Mr. Berent didn't come along<br> this time. I've been told I resemble him.<br> - Who told you that, Mr. Harland?<br> - I did.<br> Louise, don't you think so?<br> Well, yes, now that you mention it.<br> - Glen?<br> - Well, in a way.<br> In every way.<br> I noticed it the minute I saw him<br> in the club car.<br> His face, his voice, his manner.<br> It's uncanny.<br> Well, I must admit<br> you've aroused my curiosity.<br> If I should get an opportunity<br> to meet your father...<br> That's hardly likely, Mr. Harland.<br> - My husband...<br> - We've come for my father's funeraI.<br> My goodness, there is a resemblance.<br> Why, a most decided resemblance.<br> Tell me, what did they mean<br> about coming here for the funeraI?<br> Oh, that was rather<br> a figure of speech.<br> As a matter of fact, Professor Berent<br> died some time ago in the East...<br> ...and his body was cremated.<br> They brought the ashes here.<br> They're having the ceremony<br> in the morning.<br> - Where?<br> - High up in the mountains...<br> ...sort of a plateau.<br> A favorite spot of his.<br> He used to go there a lot with Ellen.<br> Well, now, if you'll excuse me,<br> I'll see if the children have gone to bed.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Ellen's gone for a walk.<br> - Well, how did you know that I...?<br> - Oh, I'm quite psychic.<br> Oh.<br> And is your sister psychic too?<br> Oh, yes, much more than I am.<br> Only I'm not her sister.<br> - You're not?<br> - No, I'm her cousin.<br> I've lived with the family<br> ever since I was a child.<br> Mrs. Berent adopted me.<br> Good evening, Mr. Harland.<br> Oh, good evening.<br> In all fairness,<br> I must confess the nights here...<br> ...seem more beautifuI<br> than at Beacon Hill.<br> Infinitely. I think everything's<br> more beautifuI here.<br> Ellen has gone for a stroll.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> - Am I intruding?<br> - Not at all.<br> I...<br> Well, I'm afraid I owe you an apology.<br> It was rather clumsy of me at the table<br> to speak of your father.<br> That's all right.<br> You couldn't have known.<br> You were very close to your father,<br> weren't you?<br> Yes, we were inseparable.<br> From the time I was able to walk...<br> ...we were both happiest<br> when we were together.<br> Engagement ring?<br> Yes.<br> I believe I'd better be going in now.<br> We're getting up at 5:00<br> in the morning.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Don't you think somebody<br> ought to look for Ellen?<br> - What for?<br> - Well, it's pretty wild country up there.<br> - Perhaps she's lost.<br> - Ellen knows her way home.<br> I know, but it's been over 12 hours.<br> Suppose something happened to her.<br> Nothing ever happens to Ellen.<br> Well, I think I'll take a ride<br> before I turn in.<br> - Are you all right?<br> Oh, yes, perfectly.<br> I just wanted to be alone for a while.<br> Thank you for coming<br> to the funeraI.<br> - You knew I was there?<br> - Yes, I saw you as I rode by.<br> I hope you don't think<br> it was just curiosity.<br> No, I understand.<br> - I'm glad you were there.<br> - So am I. I'll never forget it.<br> Father used to say it was like riding<br> across the front lawn of heaven.<br> We made a pact to bring<br> our ashes here when we died.<br> "If you die first," I told him,<br> "I'll bring yours here.<br> If I die first, you'll bring mine. "<br> Yet, I know now...<br> ...people you love don't really die.<br> Can we go now?<br> I'm not a bit sleepy, are you?<br> Not in the least.<br> Have you forgiven me yet?<br> - What I said about your book.<br> - Oh, that.<br> I have a different opinion now.<br> I finished reading the book last night<br> and I found it quite absorbing.<br> What made you<br> change your mind?<br> I got interested<br> in one of the characters.<br> - Which one?<br> - The author.<br> Well, I assure you the book<br> is not supposed to be about me.<br> Oh, but it is,<br> whether you like it or not.<br> "Every book's a confession,"<br> my father always said.<br> - You have to read between the lines.<br> - And did you?<br> - Well, what sort of man am I?<br> - You're a bachelor.<br> Thirty years old.<br> You were born and raised in Boston...<br> ...and you went to Harvard,<br> where you edited the Lampoon.<br> When you graduated, you went to Paris<br> and you studied painting for a while.<br> You have a lodge in Maine<br> called Back of the Moon.<br> Before you went in for writing novels,<br> you were a newspaper man.<br> Your favorite sport is fishing, and you<br> speak French and Spanish quite well.<br> Shades of Sherlock.<br> You got all that<br> just from reading my book?<br> Just from reading the dust jacket.<br> It was all there under your picture.<br> You know, if you'd lived in Salem<br> Why did you give up painting?<br> Well, it was like this.<br> In the first place,<br> I discovered I was colorblind.<br> Since I was interested<br> in Post-Impressionism...<br> - ...that didn't matter, did it?<br> - No.<br> When I made the acquaintance<br> of the boys on the Left Bank...<br> ...I found that they lived<br> in squalid garrets...<br> ...and most of them<br> were miserably undernourished.<br> Have you ever known<br> what it was to be really hungry?<br> I'm hungry right now.<br> You must be.<br> You haven't had dinner, have you?<br> - Nor lunch.<br> - You poor thing, you must be famished.<br> Mrs. Robie told Emily<br> to leave you a tray.<br> Good.<br> Oh, there it is.<br> I'll get it.<br> Let me.<br> Tell me about your place in Maine.<br> Oh, it's just a cabin,<br> a shack, that's all.<br> But it's set down in just about the most<br> beautifuI country I've ever seen.<br> Why do you call it Back of the Moon?<br> Well, there's a lake up there,<br> shaped like a crescent.<br> Danny and I used to spend<br> all our summers there.<br> - You love Danny a lot, don't you?<br> - Well, naturally.<br> Is that why you've never married,<br> because you've had to take care of him?<br> No, not exactly.<br> The way I feeI about marriage...<br> Well, it's like... Thank you.<br> It's like that trip I made to Europe<br> after I graduated.<br> I hadn't the least idea of going abroad.<br> It just happened.<br> I was taking a walk with a girI.<br> We went down to Boston Wharf<br> and watched a freighter being loaded.<br> I liked the looks of her.<br> - The girI?<br> - No, the freighter.<br> She looked good to me<br> and she smelled good.<br> I didn't know where she was going, but<br> I knew I was going with her. And I did.<br> Mmm....<br> This is the tastiest sandwich<br> I've ever eaten.<br> - What is it?<br> - Turkey. Wild turkey.<br> - Ever hunted them?<br> - No, I haven't.<br> It's tricky shooting.<br> They're sort of scary, but they're so big<br> and clumsy, they hate to take wing.<br> It's a lot of fun.<br> I'd like to try it sometime.<br> - How about tomorrow?<br> - Well, if Glen has no other plans.<br> - I meant just the two of us.<br> - I'd love to.<br> Why did you come for me tonight?<br> Well, I don't know exactly. Everybody<br> assured me you'd be perfectly all right.<br> I guess it was just an impulse.<br> - Like the time you took the freighter?<br> - Yes.<br> You knew I was coming up<br> there tonight.<br> You were waiting for me,<br> weren't you?<br> Yes.<br> And you came, didn't you?<br> Well....<br> Good night.<br> Hello.<br> - What's going on up there?<br> - I'm just pruning and tying up the roses.<br> - I hope I wasn't interfering.<br> - Not at all. I'm glad you're here.<br> I was thinking about you.<br> Something you said the other night.<br> - What did I say?<br> - Something rather strange.<br> You said you'd been adopted<br> by Mrs. Berent.<br> Well, what's so strange about that?<br> Well, you didn't say<br> Mr. and Mrs. Berent.<br> - Weren't you adopted by both of them?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Why did you say Mrs. Berent?<br> - I don't know.<br> I suppose it was because<br> she suggested that...<br> She was alone so much<br> of the time, and I...<br> I mustn't keep you from your work.<br> - Be carefuI.<br> - Oh, I'm all right.<br> How's that for an entrance?<br> Perfect.<br> I'm delighted to see you.<br> - All of you.<br> - Thank you.<br> I do hope I've interrupted you<br> in your work.<br> You have, constantly, all morning.<br> How could I?<br> I haven't been with you till now.<br> Oh, yes, you have. I've been thinking<br> about you and about Quinton.<br> - Who told you his name?<br> - Glen Robie.<br> - How did he happen to tell you?<br> - I asked him.<br> - Why?<br> - Because I hated Quinton.<br> - Do you know him?<br> - No.<br> - Then why do you hate him?<br> - Because you knew him.<br> That's nice.<br> You going to hate everybody I know?<br> You've lost your ring.<br> No, I took it off an hour ago.<br> Forever.<br> Come on, hurry up!<br> I'll race you across.<br> One, two, three, go.<br> Thattaboy, Lin.<br> Come on, Lin, keep it up.<br> Come on.<br> - Lin's going to win.<br> No. Ellen.<br> Ellen always wins.<br> The winner!<br> Don't forget we have a date<br> after lunch.<br> Quiet, Fritz. Lie down.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Oh, come in.<br> Hello, Robie.<br> Quiet, Fritz. Quiet.<br> Let me take your things.<br> Thank you.<br> Here, let me fix your tie.<br> Well, hello.<br> - What in the world brought you here?<br> - An airplane.<br> I grabbed the first one I could catch<br> after getting your telegram yesterday.<br> Why all the rush?<br> I wanted to be among the first<br> to congratulate you...<br> ...on your forthcoming marriage.<br> Well, we hadn't planned<br> to announce it for a while...<br> ...but since you've let the cat<br> out of the bag....<br> Darling, this is Russell Quinton.<br> My fianc, Richard Harland.<br> How do you do?<br> - Might I have a moment with you alone?<br> - Certainly. We can go in the library.<br> Will you excuse us?<br> Mrs. Berent, Ruth.<br> Dick. Dick, is it true?<br> - I'm so happy for Ellen. For both of you.<br> - Thank you.<br> That's all very well, but what I want<br> to know is when and how?<br> - Well....<br> - I'm sorry, Russ. Really, I am.<br> I never expected you to come here<br> in the midst of a politicaI campaign.<br> - When do you plan to be married?<br> - As soon as possible.<br> Would it be convenient for you<br> to postpone it untiI the fall?<br> UntiI after election, you mean.<br> It wouldn't do me much good<br> for the news to get out...<br> ...that I'd been jilted<br> and thrown aside like an old shoe.<br> Oh, come now, Russ.<br> Surely there's no politicaI significance...<br> ...in the fact that a lady<br> has changed her mind.<br> I don't understand it, Ellen.<br> I always knew you'd never marry me<br> while your father was alive.<br> But after he died, I thought...<br> Well, I thought there might be a chance.<br> What happened?<br> I'm in love.<br> We intend to get married at once.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Don't look so downcast.<br> I'll still be able to vote for you.<br> Perhaps you don't think I'm good enough<br> for you or romantic enough.<br> People thought I was marrying<br> into the Berent family for reasons...<br> ...but that's not true.<br> I want you to know<br> that I had only one reason.<br> I want you to know<br> that I was in love with you.<br> I'm not a man who loves often, Ellen.<br> I love once.<br> Thank you, Russ.<br> That's quite a concession.<br> I loved you...<br> ...and I'm still in love with you.<br> That's a tribute.<br> And I always will be.<br> Remember that.<br> Russ, is that a threat?<br> Now, look here, Ellen...<br> Darling, will you marry me?<br> Why, you unpredictable little...<br> And I'll never let you go.<br> Never, never, never.<br> Ellen, there he is.<br> Danny.<br> Dick.<br> Dick!<br> Easy, boy, easy.<br> Oh, Dick!<br> Hey, you've put on weight.<br> - I believe you've actually grown.<br> - You look sort of different yourself.<br> Get my telegram?<br> Yeah, but I didn't sleep much<br> that night.<br> I kept thinking, "Now he's left<br> the ranch, and now he's in Chicago. "<br> I kept seeing that train<br> coming nearer and nearer.<br> - I counted every turn of the wheels.<br> ELLEN: May I come in?<br> Hi, Danny.<br> Hi, Ellen.<br> I hope you like her, Danny, because<br> if you don't, we'll send her right back.<br> Oh, please don't let him fire me,<br> Danny. I like this job.<br> Don't you worry.<br> If he fires you, I'll hire you.<br> Thank you.<br> - Were you surprised to get my letter?<br> Not a bit. I knew what was<br> in that letter even before I opened it.<br> I just kept reading it over<br> and over again, just to sort of...<br> - Get used to the idea?<br> - Yeah.<br> I was trying to picture<br> what kind of a place Taos was...<br> ...how long a honeymoon is.<br> Ellen didn't like Taos.<br> I thought Warm Springs would be<br> better for a honeymoon.<br> I hope you can stay a while.<br> We're going to take a cottage<br> right here in Warm Springs.<br> - And live here, you mean?<br> - That's right.<br> That's Ellen's idea.<br> That's the way she wants it.<br> Gosh.<br> Well, Mrs. Harland.<br> I think I can feeI safe in saying<br> the job is permanent.<br> Thank you, sir. I always does my best.<br> I trust you'll find the soup<br> to your taste.<br> It's sheer understatement<br> to call this ambrosia soup.<br> I call it consomm la patchouli.<br> When you hire a cook,<br> teach her the recipe.<br> I have no intention of hiring a cook<br> or a housekeeper or any other servants.<br> - You mean for the present.<br> - Ever.<br> - Idiot.<br> - I don't want anybody else but me...<br> ...to do anything for you.<br> I want to keep your house and wash<br> your clothes and cook your food.<br> A born slavey.<br> I don't want anybody else<br> in the house but us.<br> - Ever?<br> - Ever.<br> Well, but suppose in the naturaI course<br> of events....<br> - Well, that's different.<br> - And what about Danny?<br> Well, that's different too.<br> Only three people have been<br> to Back of the Moon:<br> Me and Dick and Thorne.<br> - Who's Thorne?<br> - Leick Thorne. He's a woodsman.<br> He helped build the house, the dam,<br> the boathouse and all.<br> He takes care of the place.<br> I'd like to get hold of some<br> of Richard's baby pictures.<br> - Could I, do you suppose?<br> - Yeah, there's a whole album full.<br> A lot of college yearbooks<br> with loads of pictures of him.<br> Only, there's one he doesn't like<br> to show to anybody.<br> Why not?<br> Well, it's got a picture<br> of Enid Sothern in it.<br> Who's she?<br> The one they voted<br> the best-looking girI.<br> - Was she really beautifuI?<br> - Not as beautifuI as you are.<br> Thank you, Danny.<br> Won't it be wonderfuI<br> when you can go back to schooI?<br> Gosh, yes.<br> - What schooI did you go to?<br> - Same one as Dick.<br> - Boarding schooI?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, that must be fun.<br> - Sure is.<br> Uh.... Has Dick been busy lately?<br> Yes, he's been working awfully hard<br> on his book.<br> We mustn't interrupt him.<br> Besides, have you forgotten<br> our secret?<br> Danny.<br> Dick. Dick.<br> Danny. Danny.<br> Now we can, all three of us,<br> go to Back of the Moon.<br> Can't we, Dick? Can't we?<br> You bet we can. You bet we can.<br> It's way up north, miles from nowhere.<br> I know all about that place.<br> I've heard about it plenty from Danny.<br> - He can't wait to get up there again.<br> - I know, that's my problem.<br> Dr. Mason, my husband is planning<br> to leave for Back of the Moon...<br> ...as soon possible,<br> and he wants to take Danny with us.<br> So do I, of course.<br> - What's the problem?<br> - Well, it's so remote up there.<br> Wild and rugged<br> and miles from the nearest town.<br> The facilities are primitive.<br> There isn't a telephone...<br> ...in case we need a doctor for Danny.<br> I'm sure he won't need<br> a doctor up there.<br> - Or medicine?<br> - Or medicine or anything.<br> - What about schooI?<br> - That can wait.<br> I must say Danny's progress<br> has been rather remarkable.<br> I don't know how you did it.<br> You must've willed that boy to walk.<br> But don't you see, doctor...<br> ...my husband will be busy<br> a good deaI of the time writing...<br> - ...and with nobody else...<br> - Isn't somebody there?<br> - Somebody by the name of Thorne?<br> - Yes, but he's leaving, and so it'll be...<br> I assure you, I don't want<br> to shirk any responsibility.<br> I'm thinking only of Danny, and I...<br> No, that isn't true.<br> I'm thinking a little about myself too.<br> I know you'll understand, Dr. Mason.<br> I gave up my honeymoon<br> to come here...<br> ...so my husband could be<br> with his brother.<br> But he's been working,<br> and the burden's been on me.<br> I've spent hours here every day.<br> I was glad to do it.<br> It was no sacrifice at all.<br> I love Danny as much as he does...<br> ...and I'm just as happy as he is<br> that Danny's doing so well.<br> But after all, he's a cripple.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to say that.<br> I'm sure you didn't.<br> I didn't mean it.<br> Of course not.<br> I'm afraid I haven't been<br> too well myself lately.<br> Mrs. Harland,<br> what do you want me to do?<br> I want you to tell my husband it would<br> be better for Danny to stay here.<br> But that isn't true. It's much better<br> for him to go to Back of the Moon.<br> But it could do no harm for him<br> to stay here or go back to schooI.<br> If you'll tell my husband...<br> - Why don't you tell him?<br> - Because coming from you...<br> - Richard.<br> - Hello, doctor.<br> Oh, Richard, I've got<br> such wonderfuI news.<br> Dr. Mason just consented to let Danny<br> come with us to Back of the Moon.<br> Oh, no, darling, please.<br> Let me.<br> I want to be the first to tell him.<br> And this is Leick Thorne.<br> Hello?<br> Yes. It's for you.<br> Hello?<br> Oh, golly, Ellen!<br> We're going to Back of the Moon.<br> Yes, Ellen.<br> When?<br> Tomorrow?<br> Oh, gosh.<br> Yeah?<br> Gee, thanks, Ellen.<br> Gosh.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Oh, darling, I dreamed you were...<br> What gives?<br> Another day with you.<br> Twenty-four hours with you.<br> Good morning, Dick.<br> - Hey, good morning, Danny.<br> - Good morning, Ellen.<br> Hi, Danny!<br> Hey!<br> How about a dip in the lake<br> before breakfast?<br> Okay.<br> - Morning, Mrs. Harland.<br> Thorne.<br> Who gets up first, you or the sun?<br> Well, mostly it's neck and neck.<br> I thought I'd fix breakfast<br> for you this morning.<br> Oh, no. That's my job.<br> I'm beginning to feeI sort of like<br> a fifth wheeI around here.<br> You mustn't feeI like that.<br> Richard considers you a part<br> of the place.<br> You must've been especially nice to him<br> when he was a boy.<br> Oh, that wasn't hard. He was a nice kid.<br> You must've had<br> wonderfuI times together.<br> Yes, tolerable.<br> Did he change much<br> when he got to be a young man?<br> Not especially.<br> Did he use to confide in you a lot?<br> Yeah, sometimes.<br> Did he ever tell you<br> about Enid Sothern?<br> - Who?<br> - Enid Sothern.<br> I don't especially recall he did.<br> Who was she?<br> Oh, nobody in particular, I guess.<br> Just schooI stuff.<br> I'll take those.<br> - Thorne, do you dream a lot?<br> - Never.<br> I had the most awfuI nightmare<br> last night.<br> We were out in the skiff, my husband<br> and I, and he jumped in for a swim.<br> But I was too lazy,<br> so I just rowed after him.<br> Somehow I was afraid. When we got<br> to the middle of the lake...<br> ...I thought it was time for him<br> to get in the boat.<br> So I decided to call out to him,<br> but I had no voice.<br> Suddenly, Richard went under,<br> not diving, but the way seals do...<br> ...just sort of settling in the water.<br> Then he came up again,<br> and one of his arms flung out to me...<br> ...as if he were trying to call to me.<br> I tried to row to him, but the lake<br> was like glue. The boat wouldn't move.<br> My arms were paralyzed.<br> Then he went down again...<br> ...and this time he stayed down.<br> I reckon there's only one way left<br> for you to save his life.<br> - How?<br> - For you to wake up.<br> That's just what I did.<br> Hey!<br> Come and get it!<br> - Come on in, Ellen!<br> The water's swell!<br> I guess we'd better go in.<br> Okay, last one in is a sissy.<br> Oh, no!<br> - No what?<br> - Good grief!<br> - "'Will you marry me?' he said. "<br> - Well, what's wrong with that?<br> First, men never propose. They may<br> think they do, but it's really the woman.<br> Who told you that? Ripley?<br> If men do propose, they never say,<br> "Will you marry me?"<br> Get away. Get away, gadfly.<br> - Did you ever propose to a woman?<br> - Hundreds of them.<br> - When you proposed to Enid Sothern...<br> - Who told you about Enid Sothern?<br> Did you say, "Will you marry me?"<br> - I didn't propose to her.<br> - Did she propose to you?<br> - Beat it, will you?<br> - How did you propose to me?<br> - Uh....<br> - You didn't.<br> I proposed to you, like this.<br> - Remember?<br> - Okay, I'll marry you...<br> ...right after I finish my chapter.<br> Oh, I hate your chapter.<br> I hate all your chapters.<br> - They take up too much of your time.<br> - Funny, that's what my publisher says.<br> No, I'm serious. After all, it isn't<br> as if you had to write for a living.<br> I've got more than enough<br> for both of us...<br> ...and it's the dearest wish<br> in my heart to support you.<br> Is that bad?<br> Oh, darling, I didn't know it could be<br> so wonderfuI here, Back of the Moon.<br> - You like it here, do you?<br> - Every minute...<br> - ...if only it weren't so crowded.<br> - Crowded?<br> Why, this is the most remote,<br> uninhabited place east of the Mojave.<br> I mean the cabin.<br> Not that I mind chaperones,<br> not in the least.<br> But there's Danny's room on one side of<br> us and Thorne's room on the other side.<br> And the wall's as thin as paper,<br> and the acoustics disgustingly perfect.<br> Well, at least nobody snores.<br> Do you know since we've been married,<br> we've never been alone, not for a day?<br> - Do you know...?<br> - Do you know...<br> ...Thorne moved his cot<br> to the boathouse this morning?<br> He did? Oh, Richard,<br> I hope you didn't tell him I...<br> Oh, not at all. It was his own idea.<br> As far as Danny's concerned...<br> - Where is Danny?<br> - He went with Thorne.<br> - Where's Thorne?<br> - He went to town.<br> - You don't mean they'll stay in town?<br> - Oh, certainly not.<br> - Then why did they go?<br> - Do you have to know everything?<br> - Tell me.<br> - No.<br> - Tell me.<br> - Cut it out.<br> - Tell me.<br> - Stop it. It's a secret.<br> You can't have any secrets from me.<br> We wanted to surprise you, honey.<br> Danny, you sing one. Come on.<br> What was that?<br> That was a loon. There's a couple<br> of them across the lake.<br> They sound horrible.<br> You'll get used to it. Wait till you<br> see the deer. You'II love them.<br> They come right up to the cabin<br> to be fed.<br> - What do you give them?<br> - Potato peelings and salt.<br> And then, of course,<br> there's our porcupine.<br> Oh, yeah. He used to come every<br> morning and nibble on the doorstep.<br> The Robies paid us a visit<br> at Bar Harbor just before we left.<br> Are they well?<br> - The children had the mumps.<br> - Oh.<br> Of course, you've heard about Russ<br> Quinton being elected district attorney.<br> Really?<br> They say he's got his mind set<br> on the governorship.<br> It wouldn't surprise me if he made it.<br> Can we find some wild wisteria<br> and transplant it around the cabin?<br> - I know where there's some.<br> - Oh, fine. Then tomorrow we...<br> I'm afraid Thorne<br> won't have time for that.<br> He has his work to do.<br> Look what I can do.<br> Thorne showed me.<br> Oh.<br> After all, Mother, you must remember<br> Ellen didn't expect us.<br> We shouldn't have come, Ruth.<br> We shouldn't have come.<br> There must be loose bricks<br> in the chimney.<br> I noticed it wasn't drawing very well.<br> Did you hear me, darling?<br> What happened tonight?<br> Since Ruth and your mother arrived<br> you've been acting like a shrew.<br> At the landing you were cold,<br> at dinner, aloof.<br> - After dinner you were beastly.<br> - I didn't expect guests.<br> - I thought you'd be pleased.<br> - Don't let's quarreI, Richard.<br> And Danny adores you.<br> You hurt him. Why?<br> - I was upset.<br> - You were insulting to your mother...<br> ...and mean to Thorne,<br> treated him like a servant.<br> - Isn't he?<br> - Certainly not!<br> He's a friend,<br> one of my dearest friends.<br> Is Ruth one of your<br> dearest friends too?<br> What's eating you?<br> Ruth is your sister.<br> Ruth is not my sister. All night long,<br> you devoted yourself to her!<br> Well, somebody had<br> to make her welcome.<br> Maybe you're in love with her.<br> You're in a rotten mood, Ellen.<br> - Maybe that's why you invited her.<br> - Do you want her to hear you?<br> You can't draw a breath in this room<br> without being heard all over the house.<br> Let's change the name from<br> Back of the Moon to Goldfish Manor.<br> What's happened to you?<br> You're whipping yourself<br> into a fit of hysterics.<br> Oh, no, I mustn't do that.<br> It might disturb Mother and Ruth<br> or wake up Danny!<br> Ellen, what's got into you?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Oh, darling, forgive me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I can't help it.<br> It's only because I love you so.<br> I love you so I can't bear to share you<br> with anybody.<br> Well, the gaI with the hoe.<br> Oh.<br> You're doing a swell job.<br> It's easy here. You just put things<br> in the ground and they grow.<br> It's much harder by the sea<br> where we live.<br> Dick, when are you going to visit us<br> at Bar Harbor?<br> When I finish the book maybe.<br> I think you'II like it there.<br> We were talking about it this morning,<br> Mother and I.<br> We thought it might be a good idea<br> for Danny to go back with us.<br> The beach is lovely,<br> and we have a sailboat.<br> He'd have a wonderfuI time.<br> I'm sure he would.<br> There's a schooI too,<br> an excellent schooI.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Ellen told me all about it.<br> I'll have a talk with Danny.<br> Dick, as far as I've read, it's splendid.<br> Oh, well, just for that I'll dedicate<br> the book to you.<br> And what shall I say?<br> To my sweet, to my beautifuI,<br> my discerning mother-in-law who...<br> Who advised me to dedicate<br> this book to my wife.<br> - I'll dedicate the next one to her.<br> - You dedicate them all to her.<br> I hope you'll send me the rest<br> when it's finished.<br> There are only<br> a few more chapters to write.<br> I'll wind it up before you leave.<br> That's hardly likely.<br> We're leaving Saturday.<br> Saturday? That's preposterous.<br> You've only been here a few days.<br> Yes, and they've been wonderfuI days.<br> Ruth and I shall never forget them.<br> But there are reasons<br> why we must be getting home.<br> - Does Ellen know you're leaving?<br> - I told her this morning.<br> Now, don't look so downcast, Dick.<br> In a way, mothers-in-law<br> are like children.<br> They should be seen and not heard...<br> ...and not seen too much.<br> What's wrong with Ellen?<br> There's nothing wrong with Ellen.<br> It's just that she loves too much.<br> Perhaps that isn't good.<br> It makes outsiders of everyone else.<br> But she can't help it.<br> You must be patient with her.<br> She loved her father too much.<br> Please, sit still.<br> How do you expect me...?<br> I can't help it. It tickles.<br> You'll just love our house by the sea.<br> There are rocks on one side<br> of the beach. When it's low tide...<br> ...you can go there and watch<br> the anemones and ink-squids.<br> And there are the most wonderfuI shells<br> and pebbles, all sizes and colors.<br> Sounds swell.<br> Hold still.<br> How would you like to go<br> to Bar Harbor for a while?<br> I had a letter from Ruth,<br> and she'd love to have you.<br> I'd love to go.<br> With Dick, you mean?<br> He doesn't want to leave<br> untiI the new book's finished.<br> Then we can join you.<br> Well, I'd rather wait then...<br> ...till we can all go together,<br> the three of us.<br> We wouldn't be separated for long,<br> just a few weeks.<br> No, I'd rather wait.<br> Can I swim all the way across today?<br> - Think you could make it?<br> - Why, sure.<br> I made it 3/4 yesterday<br> and wasn't a bit tired.<br> - All right.<br> - If I make it today...<br> - ...can we show Dick tomorrow?<br> - Yes, tomorrow.<br> We don't have to tell him how long<br> I've been practicing, do we?<br> No, we can just pretend you decided<br> to do it on the spur of the moment.<br> Yeah, that's what we'll do.<br> You know,<br> I can just see him watching now.<br> After a while he'll say,<br> "That's enough. Get back in the boat. "<br> I'll pretend like I didn't hear him<br> and keep on going.<br> Are you ready?<br> Ready.<br> - You think you can make it, Danny?<br> - It's a cinch.<br> Don't worry about your direction.<br> I'll keep you on your course.<br> Okay.<br> Are we halfway to the point yet?<br> Not yet.<br> You're not making<br> very much progress, Danny.<br> Are you all right?<br> I'm a little winded.<br> I had a kink in my side,<br> but it's gone now.<br> - You'd better float for a while.<br> - Yeah.<br> I.... I think I'm getting tired.<br> Take it easy.<br> You don't want to give up<br> when you've come so far.<br> Okay. I'll get my second wind<br> in a minute.<br> Oh....<br> The water's cold.<br> Colder than I thought.<br> I ate too much lunch.<br> I have a stomachache. Ellen!<br> It's a cramp.<br> Ellen, it's a cramp!<br> Ellen! Ellen!<br> Help me!<br> Danny!<br> Danny!<br> Danny!<br> I've been cleaning Father's laboratory.<br> It might be a good place<br> for Dick to work.<br> He's dropped his work.<br> He's dropped everything.<br> I'm losing him, Ruth.<br> I'll die if I lose him.<br> Perhaps if you went back to the lodge,<br> just the two of you.<br> No, he hates it now,<br> everything about it.<br> He never wants<br> to set foot there again.<br> And he doesn't want<br> to go back to Boston.<br> If I only knew what he was thinking.<br> You've always helped me, Ruth.<br> Help me now.<br> A little time, Ellen, you'll see.<br> He's had a great loss.<br> There's a great emptiness in his life.<br> If he only had a child of his own.<br> Oh, it's wonderfuI!<br> When Ellen was little,<br> her father fixed this as a playroom.<br> When she grew up,<br> he used it as a laboratory.<br> It's going to be a playroom again,<br> as it was before.<br> Not exactly. Your baby was a girI.<br> Ours is going to be a boy.<br> - You've decided that, have you?<br> RICHARD: Definitely.<br> Ellen gave me her word of honor.<br> Stand still, will you?<br> - I've got a kink in my neck.<br> - Dotted Swiss is nice for the curtains.<br> - What about the rug?<br> - Don't put rugs in children's playrooms.<br> - You use linoleum.<br> - Why?<br> Linoleum washes easier, just in case.<br> Say, you women think<br> of everything, don't you?<br> - All right, you can rest.<br> - Oh.<br> Ellen, you shouldn't have walked up<br> those stairs.<br> You know what the doctor told you.<br> Come here and sit down.<br> What have you done<br> with Father's lab?<br> We didn't want you to see it<br> till it was finished.<br> - Where are his things?<br> - We stored them in the basement.<br> Why didn't you consult me?<br> We wanted to surprise you.<br> It's an ideaI place for a playroom.<br> But I didn't want the room changed,<br> ever.

I tried<br> to find him, tried honestly, tried hard.<br> But it was too late.<br> Why don't you kill me, Richard?<br> You could so easily, you know.<br> And the baby.<br> - You never wanted it, did you?<br> - No.<br> Don't you see?
