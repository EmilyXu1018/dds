She's got a seven.<br> - I don't know. You tell me.<br> - Hit.<br> - I'm busted. That's all right.<br> You got it.<br> You can do it.<br> Wait a minute!<br> Really? Oh, man!<br> - What?<br> - He's okay.<br> Do you want anything?<br> Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.<br> Can you make that?<br> What?<br> Fuck you! Fuck!<br> You fucker!<br> That boy is...<br> You can't judge me!<br> You! I am his father!<br> Get up!<br> Let's go, guys.<br> How are you?<br> Very well.<br> I never expected<br> to have to ask this again...<br> but how did our evening go?<br> I remember getting<br> to the casino.<br> And I remember kissing you.<br> That was really nice.<br> And then playing blackjack...<br> and then security came.<br> But after that, everything's a blank.<br> What happened?<br> They wanted to carry you out<br> and dump you onto the street...<br> but I talked them<br> into letting me walk you out.<br> That's impressive.<br> How did you do that?<br> I told them<br> that you were an alcoholic...<br> and that I would take you home...<br> and that we would never<br> go in there ever again.<br> "We"?<br> That's amazing.<br> What are you?<br> Some sort of angel visiting me<br> from one of my drunk fantasies?<br> How can you be so good?<br> I don't know<br> what you're saying.<br> I'm just using you.<br> I need you.<br> Can we not talk about it anymore?<br> Not a word.<br> You go back to sleep...<br> and I'll go out<br> and get us some breakfast.<br> - Will you be careful?<br> - Don't worry.<br> Ben, I'm working tonight.<br> I know.<br> I fuckin' talk all the time<br> because you never fuckin' listen to me!<br> - So fuck you!<br> - Shut the fuck up.<br> I'd like a beer<br> and a double Kamikaze, please.<br> We mustn't kick the bar.<br> We lean into the bar.<br> Just lean into the railing.<br> It's not vino veritaz.<br> It's en vino veritaz.<br> Who the fuck are you talking to?<br> Little brown-nosed gnomes<br> with a slingshot.<br> - To be in drunk.<br> - Lean into the bar?<br> You lean into the bar.<br> My boyfriend over there<br> is really boring the shit out of me...<br> and I was wondering<br> if you would buy me a drink?<br> Do you mind<br> if I buy her a drink?<br> - I don't care what you do with her.<br> - I'll have a rum and Coke, please.<br> Barman, a rum and Coke.<br> Can I stay with you for awhile?<br> You mean move in with me?<br> Isn't this a bit sudden?<br> I don't have a lot of things.<br> I don't think my wife<br> would dig it very much.<br> Then maybe we should just go<br> to a motel and fuck all day.<br> I could suck you like this.<br> I'm sure fucking you<br> would be wonderful...<br> but it's almost impossible for me<br> to imagine being with someone else.<br> Now listen, asshole,<br> I'm not just gonna sit here...<br> and watch her suck on your ear!<br> Shut the fuck up!<br> I am sorry...<br> but she and I have decided to spend<br> a few hours together...<br> in a motel.<br> And after that, caviar.<br> Baby, wait up!<br> You're quite a fighter.<br> Here.<br> Listen,<br> this may sound silly...<br> but I have to ask you<br> to leave.<br> It's what we do around here<br> when there's a fight.<br> The men's room<br> is around the back.<br> Sexy.<br> I'm back.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Did I scare you?<br> - What happened?<br> Fuck, Ben.<br> Did you get in a fight?<br> I thought you said<br> you didn't fight.<br> How do you feel?<br> Like the kling-klang king<br> of the rim-ram room.<br> Did you stop at a bar?<br> Did you say something stupid<br> to somebody stupid?<br> Absolutely not.<br> I was defending the honor<br> of some poor wayward maiden.<br> I bet you were.<br> Why don't you go take a shower<br> and put on your other shirt?<br> Then we'll go shopping<br> and buy you some new clothes.<br> I think this shirt is unlucky.<br> Not at all.<br> Your blood tastes good.<br> We got eggs.<br> I always had a fantasy<br> of being a flamenco dancer.<br> I think you look great.<br> We'll just get you a bow tie...<br> and then you can be one<br> of those blackjack dealers.<br> - All right?<br> - They wear it because they have to.<br> I'll wear it<br> because I want to...<br> which will make me<br> look different.<br> Let's get a drink!<br> - What is that?<br> - What?<br> Holy cow.<br> It came out of your ear!<br> I didn't have time<br> to write you a card...<br> with you breathing down<br> my neck all day...<br> so you'll just have<br> to wing it, baby.<br> Open it.<br> They're your color.<br> I think you should wear<br> one of them at a time.<br> One of these<br> and one of your other ones.<br> I was gonna buy you just one...<br> but I didn't think it would fly.<br> Nurse!<br> As a gift, I mean.<br> I'll wear them tonight.<br> One of them.<br> Tonight.<br> Put it on.<br> I can't get it.<br> I'll help you.<br> You'll be able to feel it,<br> sharp and hot under your ear...<br> as one of the brothers<br> is putting your head facedown...<br> into one<br> of the penthouse pillows.<br> Wait!<br> Maybe you should wait.<br> - Why?<br> - You can tell.<br> She really wants you to.<br> Maybe I should<br> follow you around...<br> and ask one of your tricks<br> what it's like to sleep with you.<br> They wouldn't know.<br> Maybe you should ask me<br> sometime.<br> Be happy to show you.<br> I'm gonna be home around 3:00.<br> If you're back, we could<br> watch some TV or something.<br> What I'm saying is that I hope<br> you're back when I get home.<br> Be careful.<br> You be careful too.<br> I'm gonna miss you.<br> I know this really cool place<br> in the desert.<br> We could go away<br> for a couple days.<br> I'd like that.<br> I'd like that.<br> I make comic faces and...<br> stand on my head and grin at you<br> between my legs and...<br> I know loads of jokes.<br> Wouldn't stand a chance,<br> would I?<br> You did tell me<br> I ought to find myself a girl.<br> I like it here with you.<br> Let's stay for awhile.<br> - Need a mix master.<br> - What?<br> Just sort of take everything<br> and blend it all together.<br> Take this off.<br> - Let's go inside.<br> - All right.<br> I want my drinky.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Are you okay?<br> You're bleeding.<br> Wait. Hold it.<br> - There's glass in here.<br> - I'm like a prickly pear!<br> - I'm a prickly pear!<br> - Go inside.<br> - I wanna clean up the glass.<br> - Go inside. I'll take care of it.<br> Are you sure?<br> All right.<br> - Everybody okay?<br> - We're fine.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> We'll pay for the table...<br> - and I'll clean this up.<br> - Don't worry.<br> You seem prepared for accidents.<br> We get a lot of screw-ups here.<br> You two take your loud talk<br> and your liquor to your room.<br> You check out<br> first thing tomorrow.<br> I don't want to see<br> either of you here ever again.<br> Don't you worry<br> about paying for anything.<br> And don't you worry about cutting<br> your little hands on the glass.<br> Let's just leave it at that.<br> See you in the morning.<br> I'm in here, Ben.<br> I bought some plain rice.<br> You probably don't want<br> to hear it right now, but...<br> I think it's something<br> that you could eat.<br> If you get hungry,<br> will you let me know?<br> I think I'm ready for rice.<br> I want you to see a doctor.<br> I'm not gonna see a doctor.<br> Maybe it's time<br> I moved to a hotel.<br> And do what?<br> Rot away in a room?<br> We're not gonna talk about that.<br> Fuck you.<br> You're staying here.<br> You're not going to any motel.<br> It's just one thing<br> you can do for me.<br> That's all I ask.<br> I've given you<br> gallons of free will.<br> You can do this one thing for me!<br> I have to go to work now.<br> Snake eyes!<br> Five!<br> Boxcars!<br> Five!<br> - Are you in for the convention?<br> - What?<br> You're making me really hot.<br> Perhaps I could crash on the couch<br> for a few hours and then leave.<br> Get out.<br> I was wondering<br> how much it would cost?<br> Sorry, guys.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> - Anyway, I only date one guy at a time.<br> - Wait. We got money.<br> Show her the fucking money.<br> - How much are you willing to spend?<br> - How much do you want?<br> Two hundred for an hour?<br> - Don't your friends talk?<br> - Sure.<br> - Get this on camera.<br> - Smile.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - Do you want something to drink?<br> - I'm fine.
