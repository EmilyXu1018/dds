                        Oh, I would say, uh...<br> Let's see, he was busted<br> at least nine or ten times.<br> Twice for possession of narcotics,<br> and three, four times for obscenity.<br> Um...<br> Ladies and gentlemen, Lenny Bruce.<br> Did you know that Eleanor Roosevelt<br> gave Lou Gehrig the clap?<br> "What'd he say? Jesus, does he<br> have to get that low for laughs?"<br> "What's the point?<br> That's really bad taste. "<br> The point... the point is<br> the suppression of words. Now, dig.<br> Here it is, 1964, and yet every doctor<br> I know tells me that a certain disease<br> is on its way to becoming an epidemic<br> again, when everybody knows<br> that one shot in the ass'd knock it out.<br> And yet there it is, VD,<br> right up there with the top ten.<br> Why? Because nobody talks about it.<br> Nobody even wants to say the word.<br> If the community chest<br> hits on you, do you say<br> "Excuse me, how much of my dollar<br> is going for the clap?"<br> I don't think you do.<br> What we have to do is talk about it.<br> What we really need is to get<br> some of our national heroes<br> to admit they've had it.<br> Eleanor Roosevelt<br> gave Lou Gehrig the clap.<br> She also gave it to<br> Chiang Kai-shek...<br> And he gave it to J Edgar Hoover,<br> man... which is how it really spread.<br> A boy gets the clap. Can he go to his<br> father? He can't relate to his father.<br> He's lucky if he can go to a schmuck<br> who sweeps up the drugstore.<br> - "I gotta talk to you. "<br> - "What's the matter?"<br> - "I got the clap. "<br> - "Oh, Jesus, where'd you get that?"<br> "Painting a car!<br> What's the difference? I got it. "<br> "What do you want?"<br> "You work in a drugstore.<br> Give me some pills. "<br> - "Oh, all right. Here. "<br> - "Dexedrine Spansules. Is this good?"<br> "It's all the same horseshit. Keeps<br> you awake so you know you got it. "<br> "The reason I want these pills is I got<br> a good job. I don't wanna get laid off. "<br> - "Yeah? Where you working?"<br> - "The meat-packing plant. "<br> I'll tell you what we really need.<br> Maybe one day Jerry Lewis<br> would go on television,<br> and instead of getting hung up<br> with muscular dystrophy,<br> he'd have a clapathon!<br> Forget it. It'll never happen.<br> You know why?<br> Because talking about it makes you<br> the worst person in the community.<br> When did you first meet Lenny?<br> It was back in 1951. Baltimore.<br> I was, uh, headlining... Headlining?<br> I was working at this club.<br> A- one, two, a-one, two, three, four!<br> Now when<br> the saints go marching in, yeah<br> ? Now when the saints<br> go marching in...<br> - Yeah!<br> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.<br> Here's the moment that<br> you've all been waiting for.<br> So without further ado,<br> may we present "Hot" Honey Harlowe!<br> Let's hear it, everybody!<br> Oh, Eddie.<br> Look at that hair.<br> - Who's the guy over by the window?<br> - Lenny Bruce. He's a comic.<br> - What kind of comic?<br> - Lousy.<br> - I think I know her from somewhere.<br> - Fake hair.<br> Really?<br> - He's cute.<br> - Cute? He does crap.<br> Old jokes, lousy impressions.<br> But I really had problems when I was a<br> kid. It wasn't until I was eight years old<br> that I figured out my name<br> wasn't "Shut Up. "<br> All right, folks. How about some<br> bird impressions? Bobwhite.<br> Bobwhite backwards.<br> A duck.<br> A swallow.<br> A goose. Ooh!<br> Did you ever get the feeling that you're<br> in an amateur contest, and you're losing?<br> All right, folks.<br> Let's get back to the surefire stuff now.<br> So let's go to the Show Business<br> Hall of Fame, where the MC<br> is my good friend,<br> the old Schnozzola himself!<br> It's granite out there.<br> I went into the shoe store<br> and I said to the clerk<br> "Do you sell alligator shoes?"<br> And he said "What size<br> does your alligator wear?"<br> "You're really something, Durante. "<br> And now, I'd like to introduce ya to<br> my favourite singer, Vaughn Monroe.<br> Yeah.<br> Racing with the moon<br> His act was so lousy, something<br> must have attracted you to him.<br> What was there about him?<br> Well, he was just, um...<br> I don't know, huggable.<br> Thank you.<br> My mother's a comic,<br> and I got out of the service<br> and I changed my name, you know.<br> - What's your real name?<br> - Leonard Alfred Schneider.<br> - Well, why did you change it?<br> - Too Jewish.<br> I like the name Bruce.<br> You know, Bruce sounds like<br> the captain of a football team.<br> That's why I changed it, but the first guy<br> I met whose name was Bruce<br> - tried to kiss me.<br> What hotel are you at?<br> Uh... 621, please.<br> Here? You're kidding.<br> No.<br> - Well?<br> - Well?<br> - Aren't you gonna answer it?<br> - Why?<br> How do you people really feel<br> about "doing it"?<br> Isn't that about the dirtiest thing<br> we could do to each other?<br> It's really not nice "doing it".<br> What's the worst thing you can<br> say to anybody? "Fuck you!"<br> That's really weird, because<br> if I wanted to hurt you, I should say<br> "Unfuck you. "<br> Because "fuck you" is really nice, man.<br> "Hello, Ma, it's me. Yeah, I just<br> got back. Aw, fuck you, Ma!"<br> "Sure I mean it. Is Pop there?"<br> "Aw, Pop, my Pop.<br> Aw, fuck you, too, Pop!"<br> What?<br> I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it.<br> - That I'm eating?<br> - Yeah, that you're eating.<br> No, that you're here. And that<br> I'm here with you. I can't believe it.<br> Do you know, the first time<br> I saw you in the cafeteria,<br> I wanted to go up to you and say<br> "Hi, I'm Lenny Bruce<br> and I got the hots for you. "<br> - Now, why didn't I do that?<br> - Now, why didn't you do that?<br> - It would have saved a lot of time.<br> - It would have saved a lot of time.<br> - I know why I didn't do it.<br> - Too shy.<br> Yes. I've always been shy.<br> - Even as a kid?<br> - Even as a kid.<br> I tried to get over it,<br> but I've always been very shy.<br> I guess when you get right down to it,<br> I'm just... basically...<br> a very shy person.<br> - Ho-ho.<br> - Don't you have to go to work?<br> Yes, I do, but I think I should stay here<br> and try to solve this problem<br> of extreme shyness.<br> Well, maybe I shouldn't be<br> telling you some of this, but...<br> Well, it was quite a week.<br> - Honey?<br> - Hmm?<br> Listen, someday I'd like you<br> to meet my mother.<br> - Did you stay together then?<br> - No, I had to go to Miami to work.<br> But, uh, Lenny called every day.<br> And... then one day he called<br> and said he was coming down<br> cos he couldn't stand to be without me.<br> We're all the same schmuck!<br> And it just cracks me up that we<br> try so desperately to be unique<br> when we're all the same cat -<br> Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson,<br> me, you, every cat has got that one<br> chick who really busted up his ass!<br> Wow!<br> I LOVE YOU<br> THE GUY IN 505<br> Oh, he's here!<br> Just a minute.<br> There he stands in his underwear,<br> pleading like a dummy:<br> "Please, will you touch it once? You<br> never touch it any more. Just once. "<br> "When I don't feel like it?<br> When I got a headache?"<br> - "Yeah. "<br> - "When I don't get any pleasure from it?"<br> "Yeah, that's right. Cos I'm a dummy,<br> I gotta get it touched. "<br> "If I wait for you, you'd never touch it. "<br> "Oh, I touch it a lot. "<br> "No, you don't. You think you touch<br> it a lot. You used to touch it a lot. "<br> "Now it's a big favour<br> to get you to touch it. "<br> "It's gotta be like a big holiday,<br> like Armistice Day, right?"<br> "Well, all right. "<br> "If you're gonna make me feel guilty,<br> bring it over here, I'll touch it. "<br> "No, no, no, don't do me any favours!<br> I'll just touch it myself. "<br> That's it, man.<br> We're all the same schmuck.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, man! Is that an album cover!<br> Why don't you come in,<br> big boy, and pick a few flowers?<br> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.<br> It's a shiksa goddess.<br> That's about the time<br> I came into the picture.<br> In what capacity?<br> What was your relationship?<br> Personal manager. Friend.<br> You know... the relationship<br> between a client and an agent<br> is a very delicate one. Very delicate.<br> You don't know how far to get involved<br> in their personal lives.<br> Lenny, you name it, she's done it.<br> I mean, the whole bit.<br> By the time she was 15,<br> she had already done time.<br> So you can just imagine.<br> Lenny, I'd like to be more<br> than just an agent to you.<br> I think you know how I feel.<br> I mean, otherwise I would never<br> be telling you these things.<br> What did you do, Artie?<br> Hire a private eye?<br> I didn't have to.<br> Well, I heard you two were hanging<br> around a lot together, you know.<br> It was none of my business,<br> but I just started asking<br> around about her and...<br> - I started hearing these things.<br> - I love you.<br> Well, there was this one guy<br> who said that he knew her,<br> and he went to a party<br> with her, and... she, uh...<br> Lenny, look, I don't have<br> to spell it out for you, do I?<br> Did my mother<br> have anything to do with this?<br> - Sally? No.<br> Look, Lenny, I'm not making this stuff up.<br> This isn't a very pleasant thing<br> to have to do, you know.<br> If you don't believe me,<br> check it out yourself.<br> I don't have to, man.<br> She already told me herself.<br> But, um, thanks.<br> I mean, I got involved in a lot of things<br> which I wish I didn't get involved in.<br> You know, very painful things<br> with, you know, his personal life.<br> Since you really cared for him.<br> Yeah, I loved that guy. I really did.<br> - Honey?<br> - Hm?<br> - Let's get married.<br> - What?<br> I was a June bride...<br> And I remember I was wearing<br> a bengaline suit, had on high heels.<br> Judge was Judge Liddy.<br> - You remember everything.<br> - Oh, yeah. A lot of it.<br> They've been sitting down there<br> like that for 15 minutes.<br> - Why doesn't she let him come up?<br> - Mema, give her a chance!<br> She's probably a lovely girl.<br> Oh, I knew all about her.<br> And I figured, it's his life, and if that's<br> who he loves, then that's fine with me.<br> But what can<br> they be talking about?<br> About us, dummy!<br> Oh, Jesus! There goes the hair.<br> My mother will be on all the time.<br> She probably won't<br> even know you're there.<br> Good, then I won't have to go up.<br> But you gotta meet Aunt Mema.<br> I'll get her to do her famous "Feh" for you.<br> "Feh"? What's that?<br> Her impression of a Jewish seagull.<br> "Feh! Feh!" You'll see.<br> - Come on, man, let's go.<br> - Lenny?<br> Do me a favour?<br> Please don't call me "man".<br> I really wanted her to like me.<br> - In-laws, you know?<br> Oh, now, I gotta tell you<br> about the first time<br> that this schmuck ever worked a club.<br> Here it comes.<br> Never been on stage before. I'm<br> working this club on Ocean Parkway.<br> The Victory Club.<br> Ugh, what a joint.<br> The guys were so tough,<br> they wore wool suits in the summer.<br> With no underwear.<br> Listen, I know you know the story,<br> but I'm gonna tell it anyway.<br> - All right.<br> - One night the MC didn't show.<br> He had car trouble.<br> Police found marijuana in the trunk.<br> - Good.<br> - You haven't heard that before.<br> How long did you know Leonard<br> before you two got married?<br> - Um...<br> - You're on your own.<br> Mema... I'm on, OK?<br> So, I'm sitting in the bar.<br> And in walks Lenny.<br> You should have seen me. I had on<br> brown suede shoes, and the shirt...<br> So, I says "Lenny,<br> the MC didn't show tonight. "<br> "Now, how's about if I introduce you,<br> and you introduce the acts?"<br> And he says "Oh, no.<br> Are you kidding with that?"<br> And I says "There's nothing to it. '<br> "You don't have to be funny.<br> It's intros, like 'Here's Slip and Slap'."<br> "'How about a hand<br> for Schmutz and Dreck?"'<br> Dreck is Yiddish for "shit".<br> - Ouch!<br> - So he says "OK, why not?"<br> Three seconds later,<br> I'm in the toilet... bleurgh!<br> - All over the suede shoes.<br> - Leonard!<br> - Bleurgh!<br> - Feh!<br> - Bleurgh!<br> - Feh!<br> - "Feh". There it is.<br> - Hold it! Hold it, the star is on!<br> Now, listen, I'm up there, see,<br> and I got the microphone.<br> I'm saying "Folks, the MC couldn't<br> make it tonight, blah, blah, blah. "<br> "But luckily a good friend of mine,<br> and a funny, funny guy... "<br> Bullshit. You said "the funniest guy in... "<br> Ouch. "The funniest guy in the world. "<br> You're right! Right!<br> "Leonard Alfred Schneider,<br> who just flew in from the coast<br> for the Sullivan Show,<br> happens to be in the club. "<br> You dig what she did to me?<br> My own mother.<br> I'd never been on the stage in my life,<br> and now I gotta go and try to be funny.<br> You were so nervous<br> that you came rushing out,<br> and he tripped over the mic cord,<br> and he knocked us both flat on our asses.<br> It's true.<br> It's true. You never heard<br> such a laugh - mainly her!<br> So, how long did you two know<br> each other before you got married?<br> Yes, we must know the answer!<br> How long had we known each other<br> before we got married?<br> Half an hour. I picked him up on the<br> D train after he exposed his putz to me.<br> - Terrific!<br> - "Putz"?<br> I love the "putz"! It's terrific.<br> It's true. Mema, it's true.<br> I met her on the D train,<br> and I gave her one of these.<br> - Feh!<br> - That's a small "Feh".<br> Would you like to hear a loud "Feh"?<br> I went up to her...<br> - Feh! Feh!<br> - That's loud. Can I show Sophie?<br> Sophie! Sophie's her best friend.<br> Sophie! Mema.<br> Sophie! This is the way I met my wife!<br> Mema doesn't like it. I don't understand.<br> Mema, you used to...<br> you used to kiss it when I was little.<br> Oh, Lenny, she's a terrific girl.<br> There's no bigger test<br> of how hip you really are<br> than when your girlfriend<br> becomes your wife.<br> Wow. That's a new one. Why?<br> You're walking around<br> with your jugs and pupik sticking out,<br> and guys are sitting out there<br> watching you with newspapers<br> and hats in their laps.<br> You're jealous!<br> Oh, I like that. I like that.<br> So I... I thought maybe<br> we could work something out<br> that we could do together.<br> - What, a double act?<br> - Yeah.<br> Dig what I mean.<br> Like, you talk to the average guy, man.<br> "Hey, look at that chick over there.<br> I mean, isn't that a pretty chick?"<br> "Oh, yeah, she's beautiful. "<br> "She's got a real pretty face,<br> and nutty jugs. "<br> - "You'd marry a woman like that?"<br> - "Yeah, are you kidding me?"<br> - "And let your wife dress that way?"<br> - "No. I'd knock her right on her ass. "<br> "Well, what made you dig her?"<br> "Well, you know,<br> her jugs were sticking out. "<br> - "She can't dress that way now?"<br> - "No, you crazy? That's my wife. "<br> Well, I'll have to cancel some of my, uh...<br> Forget it.<br> OK, Daddy. A double act, OK?<br> That's where the conflict starts.<br> We all want for a wife<br> a combination Sunday school teacher,<br> and $500-a-night hooker.<br> Well, he started working<br> with me to be a singer,<br> and he really played, like,<br> Flo Ziegfeld or somebody.<br> And we were together 24 hours a day,<br> so we started working around.<br> Club dates, the Catskills,<br> and, um, it wasn't a bad act.<br> Really... not a bad act.<br> Coming from a big star like you, Mr Hart,<br> that really means a lot to us.<br> And that's a very pretty<br> little lady you got there.<br> - Very pretty.<br> - Thank you.<br> I might even be able to use ya<br> on my show sometime.<br> Thank you.<br> Cos I love you, Lenny.<br> I love you younger guys coming up.<br> You younger guys are what makes<br> this business a pleasure.<br> Who wants to be a parent with<br> no children, a king with no princes?<br> I was talking on the Barry Gray Show<br> about that. Did you catch it?<br> - She never misses it, Sherman. Right?<br> - Right.<br> What I'm trying to say, you're so talented.<br> I'd hate to see ya get off on<br> the wrong foot. Work clean.<br> Don't resort to using dirt. There was a big<br> beef about your show the other night.<br> Lucky for you, I ran into Jack Goldstein.<br> I stopped him<br> from phoning in a bad report.<br> I appreciate that, but it was just<br> a mistake. It was a comedy of errors.<br> We just finished the duet, and I was<br> bored doing the same old jokes.<br> It was hot. So, dig. I took off<br> my jacket, I turned to the band,<br> and I said "Now for my 'jacket off' bit"<br> And the mic picked it up,<br> so the band cracked up.<br> - I looked at Honey...<br> - I cracked up.<br> And then I cracked up. I know it looked<br> the worst, man, but it was just...<br> That's very stupid.<br> A comic has to use his head.<br> Up there, you gotta be<br> thinking every second.<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> one of the all-time greats<br> of show business is here.<br> In fact, he got his start<br> right here in this hotel.<br> Mr Entertainment himself,<br> Sherman Hart, ladies and gentlemen!<br> Sherman Hart!<br> You're wonderful.<br> You're beautiful. Oh, you're heaven!<br> I... Beautiful audience! Oh!<br> Lenny, baby, I just love<br> what you're doing up there!<br> You'll love it, too,<br> when you see it on my Comedy Hour.<br> Wednesday night, CBS.<br> Thank you. You're beautiful.<br> I might as well tell you the times.<br> It's 9.00 Eastern, 7.00 Rocky Mountain,<br> and 4am in Tokyo. Tokyo!<br> Oh, you're beautiful!<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Lenny, baby, do me a favour.<br> Would you just talk a little slower?<br> I can't write that fast.<br> Go get 'em. Go get 'em.<br> Sherman Hart, ladies and gentlemen.<br> You're wonderful! You're super.<br> Thank you. Go get 'em, kid.<br> You know, folks, just to digress<br> for a second, I know that...<br> I'm new at this business and I've got<br> a lot to learn, but thanks to Sherman,<br> I realise I made a mistake<br> out here the other night.<br> And if I offended any of you,<br> I'd really like to apologise.<br> So, by way of making it up to you,<br> I, uh...<br> I think I'm gonna piss on you.<br> - Why?<br> - Look, I just wanna get outta here.<br> Why would you do such a terrible<br> thing on the High Holiday weekend?<br> Everybody's going to be<br> warned about you!<br> You won't work another club, room,<br> anything! You're finished!<br> - Finished in show business!<br> - Oh, no, no, no. Not that! Not that!<br> OK, you'll see! You've got<br> a rough road ahead of you, sonny!<br> Especially with your dirty mouth<br> and your no-talent wife!<br> Come here, Jack.<br> Not one Puerto Rican in your kitchen<br> hasn't schtupped your wife.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> What does he know about talent?<br> OK, what is dirty? And what is clean?<br> Now, if I had to make a choice, man,<br> I would rather my kid watches<br> a stag movie than a clean movie,<br> like King of Kings.<br> Why? Because King of Kings<br> is full of killing,<br> and I don't want my kid to kill Christ<br> when he comes back.<br> That's what happens in that.<br> Tell me about a stag movie where<br> anybody gets punched or killed.<br> If you're lucky, you might<br> see someone get tied up<br> or tapped lightly with a Hickok belt,<br> but for the most part, all you really<br> see during that hour and a half, man,<br> is a lot of hugging and kissing...<br> and moaning and groaning...<br> Oh, God. And then,<br> near the end of the movie,<br> when that one potential instrument<br> of death is revealed...<br> - The pillow.<br> The guy might smother the chick,<br> like in a horror flick.<br> He takes that pillow and gently<br> slides it under the girl's ass.<br> And they go off,<br> and nobody gets hurt or killed.<br> And it's nice.<br> And that's the end of the movie.<br> Somebody help!<br> Please, somebody help!<br> Oh, I had cuts all over my arms, my legs.<br> I had a big gash right across here.<br> Um, my bladder was punctured.<br> I was in shock for three weeks.<br> It was, uh... it was very dramatic.<br> Would you like some cold coffee,<br> Mr Bruce?<br> Thank you.<br> Yes? OK, I will.<br> Mr Bruce? You can go in now.<br> - What is that, Doctor?<br> - Morphine.<br> Some people have all the fun.<br> I love you.<br> Mr Bruce?<br> Don't leave your coat.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - Let me help you on with it.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Aw, shit.<br> Let's face it, guys are different.<br> And ladies just don't understand this.<br> Because to a lady,<br> cheating means, I know,<br> hugging and kissing<br> and liking somebody.<br> With guys, that doesn't enter into it.<br> Guys are detached.<br> You put a guy on a desert island,<br> he'll do it to mud.<br> A chicken. A barrel. Anything. A knothole.<br> If you know this,<br> would you really feel hurt<br> if you came home and found your<br> husband on the bed with a chicken?<br> - "A chicken. A chicken in our bed!"<br> - "Oh, come on. "<br> "Don't touch me! You want your dinner,<br> get your chicken to get it for you. "<br> In New York, it's illegal.<br> "Seeming sexual intercourse<br> with an animal, to wit, a chicken. "<br> That's the literal.<br> But how can you even fantasise it?<br> They're too short!<br> "How come you're alone?<br> Your chicken leave town?"<br> "Will you leave me alone already?<br> I was drunk. I met her in the yard. "<br> "Anyway, I was thinking of you<br> the whole time I was doing it. "<br> Do I have to stay in this thing?<br> I can walk, you know.<br> It's the rules. Just as far as the door.<br> You don't wanna break the rules, do you?<br> Here we go.<br> OK, take it easy. Easy, easy.<br> - You OK?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Goodbye, Mrs Bruce, Mr Bruce.<br> - Bye.<br> - It's been nice meeting you both.<br> - Thanks for everything.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - You made it with her, didn't you?<br> - Deny it. Flat-out deny it!<br> If you really love your wife, deny it.<br> If they got pictures, deny it.<br> It bugged me at first. You know, it hurt.<br> If they walk in on you, deny it.<br> Say this chick came into the apartment<br> with a sign around her neck that said<br> "I have malaria. Lie on top of me and<br> keep me physically active or I'll die. "<br> Later, I found out a lot about<br> why he did things like that.<br> And chances are, man... they'll<br> believe it. Do you know why?<br> - To prove himself.<br> - Needed to prove himself.<br> Because they wanna believe it.<br> - Insecurity?<br> - Insecurity.<br> When you got out of hospital,<br> you had a nice surprise.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You feel OK?<br> - Oh, a little weak.<br> - Don't look until I tell you to.<br> - OK.<br> Wait.<br> Now.<br> Big black Cadillac.<br> It's ours.<br> Where did you get the money? Insurance?<br> $7,000. A few more accidents<br> like this, and we're set for life.<br> Oh, it's beautiful! It's the most!<br> I love it. I really love it.<br> You should have seen the salesman.<br> He said "This car is the same kind Ike<br> and Dick drive in. " That's what he said.<br> "You take it from Fat Boy.<br> It's almost new. "<br> "It's only been used once,<br> and that was in a suicide pact,<br> so there's a little bit of lipstick<br> around the exhaust pipe. "<br> I'll take it.<br> - That's good, young lady.<br> - Where are we going, Fat Boy?<br> First, Fat Boy's gonna take you to the<br> motel... where he gonna give it to you<br> the same way he's been giving it<br> to the public for 25 years.<br> - And in the same location, too.<br> - You promise?<br> - I promise. Honk-honk.<br> - Then where are we going, Fat Boy?<br> Then Fat Boy's gonna take you to<br> that great big used car lot in the sky.<br> - Know where that is?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> - California!<br> - California!<br> Come on, Fat Boy! Get on!<br> I love you, Lenny.<br> Well, we're off to California.<br> The new life, you know?<br> We're working our way across the<br> country playing these dinky clubs.<br> We usually bombed,<br> but it was kinda fun, you know?<br> - And that's where it all started.<br> - What?<br> Well, we were working this club in Detroit,<br> and we were all clowning<br> around in the dressing room,<br> and this drummer comes up and says<br> "Hey, you cats wanna try<br> something groovy?"<br> And we said "Sure. "<br> So he hands us these little straws,<br> and we started sniffing this stuff.<br> - Up our noses, you know?<br> - What was it, cocaine?<br> No, it was, um, heroin... and stuff.<br> - And how did that make you feel?<br> - Well... I sort of went bananas...<br> crying, jumping up and down,<br> stamping all around.<br> And Lenny?<br> Lenny started laughing.<br> But it was kind of fun, you know.<br> - Wow.<br> - Before we're done with this town,<br> we'll have your jugs in cement<br> in front of Grauman's Chinese.<br> We bought pots and pans,<br> dishes and stuff like that,<br> and started setting up housekeeping.<br> It was really terrific for a while, and then...<br> - Want to see a picture I took of Lenny?<br> - "And then" what?<br> The double act<br> wasn't getting anywhere.<br> We'd gone through our savings pretty<br> fast, so I went back to work stripping,<br> and Lenny took whatever jobs he could.<br> We got in with this crowd and...<br> You know, show people, musicians,<br> stuff like that.<br> And they were all messing around,<br> fixing, stuff like that.<br> You do things on dope that normally<br> wouldn't come into your mind to do.<br> Why not?<br> I just don't want to, that's all.<br> It'll be nice.<br> Why do you keep pushing<br> this, Lenny? You keep pushing.<br> I don't know.<br> A little excitement would be good for us.<br> I don't think we can handle it.<br> Well, that's very unhip.<br> Maybe I'm not hip.<br> Do you love me?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, don't you know that I love you?<br> Yeah.<br> So?<br> And now, a word about dykes.<br> I like dykes.<br> How could you say that?<br> Lenny, Jesus Christ, you were the one<br> that talked me into these freak scenes.<br> I didn't have to do much talking, did I?<br> Oh, God. I knew it. I knew it.<br> - I told you, but...<br> - Didn't tell me you'd love it so much.<br> That's what Will Rogers once said, man.<br> "I never met a dyke I didn't like. "<br> You're crazy.<br> You know I made it with that nurse.<br> - I know it.<br> - She was terrific.<br> Lenny...<br> - You know I made it with other chicks?<br> - I don't wanna play this stupid game!<br> Don't you want to tell me about<br> the Chinese chick in the club?<br> You didn't know I knew that, did you?<br> I love you, Lenny.<br> Why don't you tell me to stop?<br> Why don't you tell yourself to stop?<br> - Tell me.<br> - Why? You obviously dig it.<br> So, you know, that's cool.<br> You son of a bitch! Why do you<br> always have to be so fucking hip?<br> If you notice,<br> comics will do endless fag jokes,<br> but never dyke jokes, man.<br> You know why? Because dykes<br> will really punch the shit out of ya!<br> It's really hard to spot dykes. Oh, yeah.<br> You know why? Because sometimes,<br> we're married to 'em.<br> I love you.<br> You parted several times.<br> What was it that you really<br> wanted from the marriage?<br> I wanted a baby. I always wanted a baby.<br> I thought it would help us, you know?<br> Bring us together.<br> So we both cleaned up for a while,<br> and on November 7th, 1955,<br> Kitty was born.<br> We were like a real family for a while.<br> And then I had to go back to work,<br> and travel a lot.<br> And Lenny started MC-ing<br> these strip joints, real dives.<br> We didn't get to see much<br> of each other and...<br> I don't know. Sometimes things...<br> just don't work out and you<br> really never understand why.<br> Do you want to see<br> a picture of Kitty as a baby?<br> No, dummy, in your mouth.<br> - Hey, man, what time is it?<br> - 9.30.<br> That's right.<br> Mommy'll be here pretty soon, OK?<br> Just couldn't get a cab.<br> Um, called three places<br> and they said they'd send one,<br> but... Nada City.<br> I finally got one.<br> Right.<br> Kitty, Mama's sorry she's late.<br> She knows Daddy's mad.<br> Mr Bruce? Mr Bruce? Your order ready.<br> - How much?<br> - $2.75.<br> Where Missis? She's the prettiest<br> girl I ever see. She sick?<br> Here the fortune cookie, and say<br> "hello" to her. She a wonderful wife.<br> - We're divorced.<br> - You're better off.<br> It's really hard when you break up<br> with your old lady.<br> At first you think "That's groovy.<br> Screw her, I'll really swing, man. "<br> But the kind of chicks you meet when<br> you're divorced are divorced chicks!<br> They all have that six-year-old kid.<br> He's like a prop from central casting.<br> But if they don't have that kid,<br> they have that French poodle<br> that has to be allowed<br> in the bedroom all the time.<br> In fact, he's on the bed<br> when you're trying to do it, man.<br> "What is the function of this dog?"<br> "He's looking at us.<br> He just wants to watch. "<br> "Wants to watch?<br> I'm not an exhibitionist! I... "<br> "You get outta here, you pervert. "<br> The sick red eyes, man.<br> Tap dancing on the linoleum floor.<br> I mean... that pink thing<br> sticking out of him.<br> It's like a lipstick, right?<br> No, if you've been married for five<br> years and it goes into the shithouse,<br> then you're gonna spend<br> a lot of time throwing up.<br> And when it's over, about the only<br> satisfaction you can have is to get even.<br> Get even with that chick, man.<br> Get that kid. Get even. I got the kid.<br> He just stole her from me.<br> We were in Hawaii, and I had gotten<br> busted for having a little pot in my car.<br> I was waiting trial<br> and he knew I couldn't leave.<br> And he took her, man, he just took her!<br> I'm sorry, the tape has run out.<br> I don't think I got all of that down.<br> Just give me a second and then...<br> maybe repeat that for me, please?<br> No, forget it. I know why.<br> He took her because he knew<br> I couldn't take care of her.<br> - Because of drugs?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> But custody doesn't mean "get even".<br> What custody really means...<br> is I raise. I get up in the morning.<br> I schlep the kid. I clean. I love.<br> It's hot.<br> Phew, man! Custody's a lot of dues.<br> Is good? You better off with me.<br> It's probably for you. I'll tell them<br> you're eating and to call later.<br> Here. Here, here. Have yourself an orgy.<br> Yeah?<br> Collect call for Mr Bruce<br> from Honey Bruce in Honolulu.<br> - Is this Mr Bruce?<br> - Yeah, this is him.<br> - Will you accept the charges?<br> - Yeah.<br> Just a moment.<br> Go ahead, Mrs Bruce.<br> - Lenny?<br> - Hi.<br> What's shaking, man? What do ya want?<br> I think you called me.<br> Oh, right.<br> Um, what are you doing?<br> Nothing. It's my night off.<br> Oh, right.<br> I've got some really good news.<br> I, uh, met this agent who said<br> that maybe he could get me<br> some dates working conventions.<br> - Yeah, I know. You told me.<br> - I did?<br> But he says it's almost definite.<br> He said he'd call on, um, Tuesday.<br> - Lenny?<br> - Yeah, that's good, that's good news.<br> Well, I... got some really good news.<br> Um... My lawyer says, uh,<br> I might not have to go to jail.<br> Um...<br> He says we can appeal, but, um...<br> How much this time?<br> Uh, I'll send what I can.<br> I'll pay you back this time.<br> He said he'd call on...<br> Tuesday.<br> I miss you, Daddy.<br> How's Kitty?<br> - Fine.<br> - You change her a lot?<br> You know you gotta change her<br> or else she gets those rashes.<br> - I gotta hang up now.<br> - Lenny?<br> Yeah, I'm still here.<br> Do you still love me?<br> Sure, but I gotta hang up now. I can't<br> make these phone bills. It never stops.<br> I still love you,<br> and as soon as I'm straight...<br> Look, I gotta hang up.<br> Uh, listen, I'll send what I can.<br> OK?<br> OK.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> The trouble is we all live<br> in a "happy ending" culture.<br> A "what should be" culture<br> instead of a "what is" culture.<br> We're taught that fantasy,<br> but if we were taught "This is what is",<br> I think we'd be less screwed up.<br> Dig what I mean.<br> I'd like to show you dirty pictures<br> that relate to your daughter, or mine.<br> These are some pictures<br> of the Kennedy assassination.<br> Now... I say these are dirty pictures,<br> because the captions are bullshit.<br> "Never for an instant<br> did she think of flight. "<br> Now, that's bullshit. That's my conclusion.<br> Time magazine's conclusion is that<br> she was trying to get out of the car<br> to get help or trying to help<br> the secret service man aboard.<br> That's their conclusion, and we buy it.<br> But I think she did the normal thing, man!<br> When the president and governor got it,<br> she tried to get the hell out of there!<br> But they want us to believe this bullshit!<br> They want our daughters, if their<br> husbands get their faces shot off,<br> and they try to haul ass<br> to save their asses,<br> if they do the normal thing,<br> then they'll feel guilty and shitty,<br> because they're not like<br> that good woman in the fantasy!<br> It's a dirty lie to tell the people<br> that if you're good, you stay,<br> and if you're bad, you run,<br> because she didn't stay!<br> Fuck it, man, she didn't stay!<br> People don't stay!<br> No, people don't stay.<br> If a Protestant woman's<br> son's marriage didn't work,<br> and she picked up and moved<br> to help raise the child,<br> would you call her a Protestant mother?<br> - So you moved to California?<br> - What else? I'm a Jewish mother.<br> Lenny went to work at Duffy's?<br> Yeah. Duffy's was a strip joint<br> about a block and a half from here.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for<br> Miss Cindy, tits and ass on the carpet!<br> Come on, you degenerates,<br> give her a hand!<br> Lenny used to do a shtick<br> between strippers.<br> - What kind of stick?<br> - No, it's "shtick", darling, "shtick".<br> I just had a wild idea. You know how<br> many asses have been on this chair?<br> Ha-ha! Really, there's been<br> a lot of asses on this chair.<br> We have no way of telling how many.<br> But lions and tigers know, right?<br> That's why when Frank Buck goes<br> "Ha! Ha!", they go "Eurgh! Eurgh!"<br> Oh, am I glad that you're here tonight.<br> All right, you've heard enough<br> of the humorous side of our show.<br> Let's welcome a great favourite,<br> Miss Baby Babylon<br> and her travelling rash.<br> - No! My answer is no!<br> - Come on, Lenny.<br> I dig it here because I can say<br> anything I want! I can do anything.<br> - Nobody's listening!<br> - What if I could get you $750 a week?<br> - 750? Get outta here!<br> - What would they pay him 750 for?<br> - To say anything that's in his head!<br> - What are those?<br> - M&M's.<br> - They dig you.<br> - How do you know?<br> - They think you're an in thing!<br> - Lenny an "in thing"?<br> - Lenny, let me call them!<br> No mother-in-law jokes?<br> - No.<br> - No Max Factor?<br> - Nothing!<br> - No tuxedos?<br> - You can go on bare-assed if you want.<br> - Mm-hm... No.<br> Aw, come on!<br> Please, Lenny, I need the money!<br> My final answer is no.<br> - Artie, Lenny's right.<br> - Yeah.<br> He's better off here where he can crack up<br> four musicians at 90 bucks a week.<br> - Now he should stay here.<br> - Yeah, she's right. Call 'em.<br> - I don't feel like it.<br> - Come on, I need the money!<br> - No, you had your chance.<br> - Artie, I wanna be a star!<br> - No.<br> - Please call 'em!<br> - All right, I'll call them.<br> - Thanks.<br> Here, sweetheart. I used<br> to work at a post office.<br> Let's hear it for Miss Baby Babylon<br> and her bobbling boobies!<br> Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a nice<br> welcome to Miss Wanda and her bird.<br> No, that was last week.<br> You're gonna love this next lovely lady,<br> so let's welcome her because<br> she'll thrill you down to your thriller!<br> Ladies and gentlemen, whatever<br> her name is, a big hand. Let's hear it.<br> I bid you all farewell. I'm leaving this toilet<br> to go on and become a big star. Oh, yeah.<br> Therefore, pursuant to the power<br> invested in me by the territory of Hawaii,<br> I hereby sentence you to be confined<br> to the Women's Correctional Institution,<br> Terminal Island, California,<br> for a period of not less than 24 months.<br> I mean, he stopped doing<br> that crappy imitation stuff<br> and he started to improvise.<br> All right.<br> - Who else can we talk about?<br> - Eisenhower.<br> Eisenhower. All right.<br> You students gotta stop<br> bugging him about the bomb.<br> He doesn't even know<br> where they keep the bomb.<br> Actually, it's not a bomb.<br> It's a button. A button on the fly<br> of a cub scout somewhere.<br> One day the whole world<br> is gonna go up, man,<br> because of one faggot scoutmaster.<br> I really dig what they do<br> with homosexuals in this country.<br> They put 'em in prison<br> with a lot of other men.<br> That's really good punishment.<br> Are there any niggers here tonight?<br> Can you turn on the house lights,<br> and could the waiters and waitresses<br> just stop serving for a second?<br> And turn off the spot.<br> Now what did he say?<br> "Are there any niggers here tonight?"<br> There's one nigger here.<br> I see him back there working.<br> Let's see. There's two niggers.<br> And between those two niggers<br> sits a kike.<br> And there's another kike.<br> That's two kikes and three niggers.<br> And there's a spic, right? Hm?<br> There's another spic.<br> Ooh, there's a wop. There's a Polack.<br> And then, oh, a couple of greaseballs.<br> There's three lace-curtain Irish Micks.<br> And there's one hip, thick,<br> hunky, funky boogie.<br> Boogie, boogie. Mm-mm.<br> I got three kikes. Do I hear five kikes?<br> I got five kikes. Do I hear six spics?<br> Six spics. Do I hear seven niggers?<br> I got seven niggers. Sold American!<br> I'll pass with seven niggers, six spics,<br> five Micks, four kikes,<br> three guineas, and one wop.<br> You almost punched me out, didn't ya?<br> I was trying to make a point,<br> that it's the suppression of the word<br> that gives it the power,<br> the violence, the viciousness.<br> Dig. If President Kennedy would<br> just go on television and say<br> "I'd like to introduce you<br> to all the niggers in my cabinet. "<br> And if he'd just say "nigger, nigger"<br> to every nigger he saw,<br> "Boogie, boogie, boogie,<br> nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,"<br> till it didn't mean anything any more!<br> Then you'd never be able<br> to make a black kid cry<br> because somebody called him<br> a nigger in school.<br> I am of Semitic background. I'm Jewish.<br> Now, a Jew, dictionary-style,<br> is one who is descended<br> from one of the tribes of Judea<br> or one who is regarded<br> to have descended from them.<br> But you and I know what a Jew really is:<br> One who killed our Lord!<br> I don't know if it got much<br> press coverage here on the West Coast<br> cos it was 2,000 years ago.<br> Although there should be a statute of<br> limitations, we're still paying the dues.<br> Why do you keep busting<br> our balls for this crime?!<br> "Why? Because you skirt the issue.<br> You blame it on Roman soldiers. "<br> I'm gonna clear the air once<br> and for all, and confess.<br> We did it. My family, I did it.<br> We found a note in the basement:<br> "We killed him", signed Morty.<br> Good thing we nailed him when we did,<br> because if we had done it within<br> the last 50 years, we'd have to contend<br> with generations<br> of parochial schoolkids<br> with little electric chairs<br> hanging around their necks.<br> - 1,000 a week?<br> - Yeah. That's right.<br> No. No, no. We want 13...<br> - Uh... 1500 a week minimum...<br> - 15?!<br> - .. guaranteed against a percentage.<br> - Percentage? What percentage?<br> - What percentage?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Uh, 20 per cent?<br> Get outta here!<br> The guy's a fad, like Hula-Hoops.<br> Oh, I'm a fucking fad? 30!<br> Look, uh... did I say 20 per cent?<br> I really meant to say 30 per cent.<br> 30 per cent? I never paid an actor<br> Well, you know Lenny. He's, uh... crazy.<br> Crazy? Are you guys trying to screw me?<br> - Yes.<br> - How crazy can he be?<br> You pay me what I want<br> or I don't show up.<br> - Who is that?<br> - Pay Lenny or he don't go to work...<br> - What's going on there?<br> - Look, I'll call you back.<br> No, man, it's a lot of bullshit, man,<br> I'm just a comic.<br> Yeah, but for a nightclub comic,<br> you certainly have a great deal<br> of social impact.<br> No. Come on, man.<br> True. And people say you feel<br> a certain obligation to speak out<br> on subjects that would not normally...<br> No, no, no. That's not it at all.<br> I'm just trying to make a buck.<br> Oh, that's nice.<br> - You want some yoghurt?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - It's good for you. It's healthy.<br> - Well, that's good.<br> I really dig being up there. It's like I want<br> to recite a poem in front of everybody.<br> It's like you stand up<br> and everybody listens to you.<br> Your mother, your father.<br> They finally listen to you, man.<br> And they don't chase you outta the room.<br> - Yeah, come in.<br> Hi. Oh, this is Artie Silver,<br> my manager.<br> This is... Sorry, I forgot your name again.<br> - John Santi.<br> - Mr Santi writes for Time magazine.<br> - Oh. Very good.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Well, usually I don't like doing interviews,<br> but... I find you very interesting.<br> "Sick comic Lenny Bruce<br> whose jokes about the President... "<br> Blah, blah, blah, blah.<br> You know what's sick?<br> Zsa Zsa Gabor will get $60,000 a week<br> in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br> And schoolteacher salaries in that<br> state, top salary is $6,000 a year.<br> Now, that's really sick!<br> And that's the kind of "sick"<br> I wish they would have written about.<br> Or the fact that married guys have<br> to jack off more than anybody else!<br> It's true, and it's weird.<br> All over the country, thousands<br> of guys are lying on bathroom floors<br> whacking it off to Miss December!<br> Because the wife don't<br> want to touch it any more.<br> You can't stop masturbating gradually.<br> You got to do it cold jerky.<br> What's Time gonna say about that?<br> All right, how about<br> some more sick material, huh?<br> Integration.<br> Actually, I do have some guilt that<br> I don't do enough for integration.<br> I try to do my bit,<br> but it just doesn't seem to be enough.<br> They asked me to make<br> the marches, but I couldn't,<br> because it's always the same old crap.<br> Ray Charles bumping into<br> Stevie Wonder all day long.<br> I mean, it's the worst!<br> No. You don't have to applaud!<br> Really, it's really weird.<br> It's enough that you're listening.<br> It's strange.<br> I used to get fired for doing this, and,<br> like, now I'm getting a following, right?<br> Oh, come on.<br> Oh, it's embarrassing!<br> Just stop it.<br> Come on. I'm walking off here<br> if you don't stop right now!<br> I don't want any more applause.<br> No more love.<br> Why aren't you two standing?<br> Thanks.<br> You know, I been thinking.<br> I mean, I am totally corrupt.<br> I mean, really. My whole act. My whole<br> economic success, whatever that is,<br> is based solely on the existence<br> of segregation, violence,<br> despair, disease and injustice.<br> And if, by some miracle, the whole<br> world were suddenly tranquil, pure,<br> I'd be standing on<br> an unemployment line somewhere.<br> So you see, I'm not a moralist.<br> If I were, I'd be donating my salary<br> to those schoolteachers. Right?<br> I'm a hustler.<br> As long as they give, I'll grab.<br> While that was happening,<br> you were in prison?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Did he visit you?<br> Whenever he could.<br> And we wrote each other a lot.<br> - What kind of letters?<br> - Oh, here, I kept some of 'em.<br> Shit. They're here somewhere.<br> Anyway, they were about, um...<br> how sorry we both were.<br> I don't know, I guess I just<br> never thought of us as being divorced.<br> Oh, wow!<br> Oh. I got some terrific pictures of Kitty.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> You'll be surprised.<br> Oh... Go on.<br> She's getting so big, huh?<br> - Kitty on pony.<br> - Oh, that's cute.<br> Kitty with stuffed lion and friends.<br> Who's the chick?<br> A friend of Artie's.<br> - Do you believe that?<br> - No, but thanks for trying.<br> Hey, listen.<br> I got cited for meritorious behaviour,<br> and that means that if I'm good<br> I get 67 days knocked off my time.<br> - Can I see the album again?<br> - Yeah.<br> It must be wonderful to be, like, a star.<br> Something's bothering me<br> and I wanna talk about it.<br> Did you read about the, uh... Thanks.<br> .. the two schoolteachers who<br> were busted for homosexuality?<br> Right. This is an editorial<br> from this morning's newspaper<br> and I'm quoting directly from it.<br> I'll just read the last sentence:<br> "And let us make certain<br> that these sexual deviates<br> are never allowed<br> inside a classroom again. "<br> That's wrong. First, they were<br> busted for what they were doing<br> What's more important<br> is what came out at the trial<br> is that they're good teachers.<br> And do you know how long it takes<br> to make a good teacher?<br> I'll tell you something else.<br> There wasn't one incident reported<br> where a kid came home and said<br> "We had five minutes of geography,<br> Man, what is that?<br> And that's what happened the first time.<br> Dirty Lenny said a dirty word,<br> and they schlepped him away for it.<br> What makes you think you've got<br> the right to say a word like that?<br> What word is that? I said a lot of words.<br> You know what word I'm talkin' about.<br> It's against the law.<br> I didn't do it, man, I just said it.<br> Yeah. If you ever said it<br> in front of my wife or kid,<br> I'd punch you right out.<br> I really don't want to get involved in this.<br> Empty your pockets.<br> At first, I think he really enjoyed it.<br> You know, he got a lot of publicity.<br> I don't know if he enjoyed it or not.<br> Enjoyed it? Hell, no.<br> He was obsessed with it.<br> Toward the end, he wouldn't do any bits,<br> he wouldn't do any jokes.<br> All he wanted to do was read<br> from the transcripts of his trials.<br> My first trial was in front<br> of a judge, no jury.<br> The judge was distinguished-looking.<br> He looked like a movie judge.<br> Like Andy Hardy's father.<br> So I said "That's cool. He'll be fair. "<br> Your Honour, if I might interject,<br> even if there were minors present,<br> I don't think that I said anything<br> that would have done them any harm.<br> Young man, I think you'd better<br> let your attorney try this case.<br> Now, as far as I'm concerned,<br> I'm ready to find you guilty right now.<br> However, I will grant a continuance<br> as you have requested.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Now it's my understanding<br> that he has a performance on, uh...<br> - Saturday.<br> - .. Saturday.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I want to caution you<br> right now, young man,<br> that if I get a report that you have<br> repeated any of this language,<br> any of these words,<br> you'll take the consequences.<br> - Is that clear?<br> - If I repeat what words? It's all right.<br> If I repeat what words<br> specifically, Your Honour?<br> You say anything obscene,<br> and I'll take that into consideration<br> when I dispose of the case.<br> Court adjourned.<br> Thank you very much.<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen,<br> Lenny Bruce!<br> Thank you. Bless you. Bless you.<br> That's because you're good.<br> Wow. Look at that. We seem<br> to have some company here tonight.<br> Could you throw the spotlight<br> against the wine chest?<br> I'd like to welcome some friends.<br> I think they're here.<br> Ah, yes, there they are.<br> Good evening, fellas. Hi, guys.<br> It's Mount Rushmore.<br> Could we throw the spot on the<br> other wall there? I think I spot two.<br> I'm not sure. Ah, yes, there they are!<br> Hi, Mickey. How's the family? OK.<br> Wow. Have you ever seen<br> so much blue in all your life?<br> I seem to be under a little pressure<br> here tonight to cool my act.<br> I don't know how many of you know,<br> but I was arrested, busted,<br> right here on this stage<br> a few nights ago, for saying... No.<br> I'm not gonna say it.<br> Let's see. It's an 11-letter word,<br> it starts with a "C" and ends with a "G".<br> And it was used... it was used<br> in the context of defending<br> a certain homosexual practice.<br> Actually, though, I don't relate it<br> only to homosexuals...<br> I relate it to any contemporary<br> woman I know! Oh, yeah.<br> Would know or love or marry.<br> - You do, too, if you're honest, right?<br> - Right!<br> OK, I'd like to ask you all<br> a few questions now, OK?<br> And you're all under oath, all of you.<br> Even standing room only.<br> How many people in this club here<br> tonight have ever used that word...<br> blah-blah-blah?<br> Don't be shy, you can raise<br> your hands. Well, that's cool.<br> Now let's get really honest. You, sir,<br> have you ever had your blah blahed?<br> Hm? It's either yes or no.<br> There's no two ways about it!<br> OK, how many men in this room<br> have ever had their blah blahed?<br> Raise your hands.<br> Oh, come on, officers.<br> Now you're under oath.<br> All right, keep your hands raised.<br> How many men in this room<br> have ever blahed a blah? Phew, man.<br> Somebody's not telling the truth.<br> OK, ma'am, tell me,<br> have you ever blahed a blah?<br> The officers couldn't see it, but she<br> went like this, and he went like this.<br> This time the whole audience<br> gets schlepped away, right?<br> This is the dirtiest show<br> I've ever done in my life!<br> This is really filth!<br> Now if there is anyone who has not<br> found this obscene, you're full of blah,<br> and I hope you never get your<br> blah blahed again! That's my show.<br> Thank you and good night!<br> Andy Hardy's father found me guilty.<br> One year in jail, and $1,000 fine.<br> Phew. So you know what we did?<br> We made a motion for a trial de novo.<br> We wanted a jury trial, figuring that<br> could better determine what was<br> obscene, as opposed to one judge.<br> Here is a guy that never<br> got past the ninth grade.<br> At the age of 36, he turns around,<br> he decides to become a lawyer.<br> And, I mean,<br> he drove his friends nuts with it.<br> Collecting old law books, case numbers,<br> newspaper clippings, you name it.<br> And tape. He started taping everything!<br> He spent $63,000 for tape recordings,<br> tape equipment, engineers.<br> He even hired a guy<br> to record his own trials!<br> Officer Ryan, were you sexually<br> stimulated by Mr Bruce's performance?<br> Irrelevant and immaterial, Your Honour.<br> - Overruled.<br> - No, sir.<br> Officer Ryan, have you ever used<br> the word "cocksucker"?<br> Not to my knowledge.<br> You are quite familiar with the term<br> "cocksucker", are you not?<br> I've heard it used.<br> Matter of fact, the word "cocksucker"<br> is frequently heard<br> in a police station, is it not?<br> Irrelevant and not germane to the issue.<br> The objection is overruled.<br> You may answer, Officer.<br> Could I have<br> the question again, please?<br> "Matter of fact, the word 'cocksucker'<br> is frequently heard<br> in a police station, is it not?"<br> I have heard it used, yes.<br> Yes, you have heard<br> the word "cocksucker"<br> used in a police station,<br> which is a public place.<br> I think you're all getting off on that word.<br> You see, Lenny Bruce's satire<br> is related to the kind of social satire<br> found in the works<br> of Aristophanes, Jonathan Swift...<br> Your Honour, Aristophanes<br> is not testifying here.<br> I don't see how he really could.<br> Reverend Mooney, could you give<br> the jury a brief summary<br> of your background in the<br> field of higher education?<br> Yes. I have been a Professor of Theology<br> for almost 12 years now.<br> Could you speak a little louder, sir?<br> Yes.<br> I've taught at Boston University<br> for three years,<br> Northwestern University for two years,<br> then UCLA for three years more,<br> and I am now at Berkeley.<br> This poor schmuck can't hold a job.<br> Reverend Mooney, how would<br> you characterise Mr Bruce's work?<br> Well, I think that Lenny<br> has a message to convey.<br> Now it's my turn. Would you speak<br> a little louder, please, Reverend?<br> Yes. He has a message to convey.<br> And he is honest and sincere about it.<br> The message is, I believe,<br> to expose and hold up American society,<br> so they can really see themselves.<br> Your Honour, I cannot hear the witness.<br> - Reverend.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> He uses words as weapons,<br> to hit people over the head with.<br> To make them recognise<br> they are being hypocritical<br> in every phase of their lives.<br> Words are his tools, and he uses them<br> like a carpenter uses a hammer...<br> Order. Order. Order.<br> Spectators will be seated.<br> Order in the court. Mr Bruce!<br> What was the nature of this "chant"?<br> Well, it was supposed to be talk<br> between a man and a woman,<br> who were... involved in the...<br> in the act of copulation.<br> "To" is a preposition. "Come" is a verb.<br> "To" is a preposition. "Come"<br> is a verb. The verb intransitive.<br> "To come. " I've heard these<br> two words my whole adult life,<br> and as a kid when they<br> thought I was sleeping.<br> It's been like a big drum solo.<br> "Did you come? Did you come good?"<br> "Did you come good?<br> Did you come good?"<br> "Did you come good?<br> Did you come good?"<br> "Did you come good?<br> Did you come good?"<br> "Did you come good?"<br> "I come better with you, sweetheart,<br> than anyone in the whole damn world. "<br> "But don't<br> come in me. Don't come in me. "<br> "Don't come in me mimme mimme,<br> don't come in me mimme mimme,<br> don't come in me. "<br> "I can't come. Don't ask me!"<br> "You don't love me,<br> that's why you can't come. "<br> "I love ya, I just can't come, that's my<br> hang-up. I can't come when I'm loaded. "<br> - "Cos you don't love me. "<br> - "What is the matter?"<br> "What has that got to do with loving<br> you? I just can't come, that's all. "<br> Now, if anyone in this room,<br> or the world,<br> finds those two words<br> obscene, indecent, immoral,<br> you probably can't come.<br> Mr Bruce, you are smiling.<br> This is not for your entertainment.<br> I don't know if what I've heard<br> is legally obscene...<br> - Your Honour, do you believe in God?<br> - Bailiff?<br> A God that made your body.<br> If you believe there is a God<br> that made your body,<br> then why do you keep telling children<br> to cover up, that the body is dirty?<br> God, what a bore.<br> If the body is dirty, then the fault<br> lies with the manufacturer.<br> That means you gotta schlep<br> God into court with me.<br> The defendant is charged<br> with violating section 311.6<br> of the California penal code<br> which provides:<br> "Any person who knowingly<br> speaks any obscene song, ballad<br> or other words in a public place<br> is guilty of a misdemeanour".<br> Now, "obscene" means<br> to the average person,<br> applying contemporary<br> standards of the community.<br> The dominant appeal of the matter<br> being to arouse a prurient interest,<br> which is a morbid or shameful interest<br> in nudity or sex or excretion,<br> which goes beyond the limits<br> of such matters.<br> Uh-oh.<br> .. redeeming social importance.<br> Now, sex and obscenity<br> are not synonymous.<br> To make sex obscene,<br> it is necessary that the portrayal of it<br> must be done in such a way<br> that its dominant tendency<br> is to corrupt the average adult,<br> by creating a clear and present danger<br> of antisocial behaviour.<br> In other words,<br> some cat'll see my show, get horny,<br> run off to a museum,<br> and jerk off a dinosaur!<br> "We, the jury, find<br> the defendant not guilty<br> of violation of Section 311.6 of the<br> penal code of the state of California,<br> to wit, 'speaking or singing obscene<br> words or ballads in a public place'."<br> You'd mentioned you'd get<br> six months off that jail sentence.<br> Did that happen?<br> No, I got in some trouble,<br> so I had to serve my full time.<br> What kind of trouble?<br> - Well, I just did something crazy.<br> - You don't want to tell me about it?<br> No.<br> All right. Anyway, you did get out.<br> Yeah. They give you a lot<br> of speeches about rehabilitation,<br> they lay a little bread on you,<br> they try to help you, and then...<br> - Good luck, dear.<br> - Oh. Thank you.<br> .. they drop you on the sidewalk.<br> It had nothing to do with justice.<br> That lady I wrote you about?<br> The one with the hat<br> and the twitchy mouth?<br> Right. When we got in the jury room,<br> and she started bitchin', "He's guilty. "<br> Then all of a sudden, "He's not guilty. "<br> - Well, how come?<br> - She was a lush.<br> And she had to get out to get a drink?<br> - Right. So I was saved by Gallo Wine.<br> - Who cares, man? You beat it.<br> I know, but I wanted to win it<br> on the First Amendment.<br> I love you.<br> Wow, was I happy. I think he was too.<br> He was making a lot of bread.<br> After the San Francisco trial<br> and all that publicity,<br> everybody wanted to see him.<br> There were the semi-hip, Playboy-type<br> people who thought it was in to dig him.<br> And then there were the people<br> who really loved Lenny.<br> You really are the truth.<br> She's a nut...<br> But she's right.<br> He started coming on like a rabbi.<br> I used to kid him about it.<br> I'd call him "the Meshugana Messiah".<br> But I'm not anti-Christ or anti-religion,<br> I just think it's encouraging that people<br> are leaving the church<br> and going back to God.<br> He was putting<br> everybody down. The Pope.<br> I mean, jeez, he even went after Kennedy.<br> I suppose people came in<br> to see if he might get arrested.<br> Oh, absolutely.<br> Right... right on. Right on.<br> You were with him when he was<br> arrested in Los Angeles and Chicago?<br> What's the matter?<br> Well, um, it's like that lady alcoholic<br> in I'll Cry Tomorrow.<br> - Lillian Roth?<br> - No, Susan Hayward.<br> See, junkies think like...<br> "I'll kick tomorrow. "<br> And it was the same thing with me.<br> But, uh, tomorrow just...<br> Follow the dots<br> down the yellow brick road.<br> Goddammit! He was just fine until<br> you had to be schlepped into it again.<br> OK, I'll, uh, kill myself.<br> Lenny was deep into drugs<br> himself, though, wasn't he?<br> You're really cute, aren't you?<br> You want me to say it.<br> Monogram Pictures presents<br> Rotten Together, starring<br> Faye Wray and King Kong.<br> You think it's funny?<br> King Kong's mother.<br> You two think you're so damn funny...<br> - Well?<br> - It's a waste of time.<br> The mercenary old bitch won't budge!<br> - She has to.<br> - Yeah, well, you tell her.<br> Beth, he's in no condition to go on.<br> You can't let him go on.<br> Look at this. It's five bucks a head.<br> You know what that would cost me?<br> If he gets busted,<br> it'll cost you your liquor licence.<br> I'll take my chances.<br> Lenny, you've got to be a good boy<br> and get up and get on your feet.<br> Lenny, you can't get up.<br> Come on, Lenny, you gotta get up.<br> I know you can do it, man.<br> - They're all out there waiting for ya...<br> - I'm no junkie.<br> You can't disappoint the public.<br> There you go, man.<br> That's it.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> Uh-oh. There's the city heat.<br> There's the county heat.<br> There's the state heat. And I even think<br> I see two cats from Interpol, man.<br> And I know I saw four Mounties, man!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> Lenny Bruce.<br> Super Jew!<br> The Ecumenical Council has given<br> the Pope permission to become a nun.<br> But only on Fridays.<br> Wait. What's that?<br> King Kong is ready now?<br> Oh, he's almost ready.<br> Oh, we're gonna have King<br> for the second show.<br> Look, I gotta warn you photographers<br> not to take any flashbulbs.<br> Cool it with the flashbulbs, man,<br> because otherwise King gets<br> a little shitty, you know.<br> So just give him a...<br> air... a building to play with<br> or an airplane to squeeze and... Yeah.<br> Where the fuck was I?<br> It's really wild, man, because<br> a judge can get away with that.<br> He just sits up there, man,<br> just junked out of his head, man,<br> and he says<br> "I'll take it under advisement. "<br> Where was I, now?<br> Let me see, where was I?<br> Oh, yeah. I know... Yeah. I know what<br> I want to do. I know what I want to do.<br> You're all wondering<br> why I'm wearing this raincoat.<br> The reason I'm wearing this<br> raincoat is, as you all know...<br> I've been busted a few times<br> for obscenity,<br> and the last time I was busted<br> was in Los Angeles,<br> and they didn't give me time to get my<br> coat. So, since Chicago is a cold city,<br> if they come, I'm ready.<br> And the heat... the heat is here<br> tonight. The heat is here.<br> Oh, are there any attorneys here tonight?<br> Where? You are?

Let 'em go.<br> I can't work this shithouse.<br> My stomach is killing me.<br> I know what I want to do.<br> I know what I want to do.<br> This is for you guys over there.<br> I read in the Chicago paper...<br> I read in the Chicago paper.<br> There's an article here<br> about these transvestites<br> who are posing as policemen.<br> Police officers who are<br> dressing up like pretty ladies.<br> Here is Officer Dolan. Stan, as the<br> guys call him down at the baths.<br> "Officer Stanley Dolan said that<br> the hardest part of police work<br> was learning how<br> to walk in high heels, man.

You can't come<br> in my shithouse without a warrant.<br> I love you.<br> I was arrested 13 times in the next year.<br> Um, I flipped out mentally.<br> I kept schlepping him<br> in and out of hospitals.<br> We were getting cancellations, bad press.<br> I wound up in a hospital...<br> in the psychiatric division...<br> in a padded cell.<br> Then he got picked up<br> for possession of narcotics.<br> Now he's got to fight that<br> in the courts, too, right?<br> Then his health started to go bad.<br> - Rita?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Would you change my barber<br> appointment to 3.15 tomorrow?<br> He had pleurisy.

That's not...<br> Where are you going?<br> These are the jokes!<br> - You want a bit?<br> - Do "Tits and Ass".<br> No, I don't wanna do "Tits and Ass"!<br> I can't do...<br> You want to know<br> where it's really at with tits?<br> You see that chick? She has beautiful tits.<br> We couldn't take a picture<br> for the newspaper<br> because that's obscene, that's offensive.<br> I'll tell you what's offensive to me.<br> The pictures in the newspapers are<br> of tits that have been shot up, maimed...<br> - Turn the house lights on.<br> - .. burned. It's really weird.<br> - Come on. What's happening?<br> - This man's under arrest.<br> What, again? Oh, what the fuck<br> is going on here, man?<br> What is it, getting chic to arrest me?<br> - He used the words... "fuck you".<br> - Objection, Your Honour!<br> Come on! That's out of context,<br> and you know it.<br> Overruled. Counsel will control<br> their client. You may continue.<br> All right, what else do you recall?<br> I mean, did he make a gesture...<br> - Objection!<br> - Leading the witness!<br> I'm sorry, Your Honour.<br> I'll rephrase the question for Mr Bruce.<br> All right, Sergeant.<br> What else do you recall happening?<br> You could refer to your notebook.<br> - He made a gesture.<br> - Hey, man, you got it in.<br> - What sort of gesture?<br> - He used the microphone.<br> Would you mind demonstrating it<br> for the court, please?<br> I never meant that to mean "jack off".<br> It's pathetic!<br> He's doing my act for the court!<br> - Mr Bruce!<br> - How can you make a fair judgment?<br> What he is doing is obscene!<br> No, man, I want to tell them!<br> - I should be doing my act!<br> - Mr Bruce!<br> I can do me better than he does me!<br> I've been at it longer than anybody!<br> If I could just talk to him eye to eye.<br> He's not a bad guy.<br> I can make him understand me.<br> He's a human being.<br> He doesn't want to hear<br> one more word from you.<br> He'll cite you for contempt.<br> You guys are not representing me<br> the way I have asked.<br> We're doing the best we can, Lenny.<br> Did you talk to him about me<br> doing my act for the court?<br> - No.<br> - Why?<br> He has all the tapes,<br> you've had several witnesses,<br> and you're not in<br> a proper emotional state...<br> I'm fine, man. I just know if I don't do<br> my act for the court, I'm gonna lose!<br> Come on, man. You know it,<br> he knows it. I know it.<br> Will you give us a coupla minutes alone?<br> No, if it's about me,<br> I wanna hear it, man. I'm not a baby.<br> OK, have it your way.<br> You don't have to whisper.<br> When it goes to the appellate court,<br> I don't want you in the record.<br> We'll have to eat a guilty verdict.<br> You are wild!<br> You eat the verdicts, I do the time!<br> - It is really bizarre!<br> - These lower courts are meaningless.<br> - They don't mean a thing.<br> - It'll be like Chicago.<br> We'll appeal to the state,<br> you'll get relief there.<br> That took two years<br> and every nickel I had!<br> I had to borrow 10 bucks just to get here!<br> I'm like a nigger<br> looking to use the toilet!<br> By the time I get relief, it'll be too late.<br> I don't wanna go to jail!<br> And I'll tell you something else!<br> Either put me on the stand,<br> you let me do my act for that court,<br> or I'm gonna sue your asses,<br> and go in there and represent myself,<br> and that's it! No more bullshit!<br> If it please the court...<br> I wish to defend myself.<br> Your Honour, I can no longer<br> relate to my counsel.<br> Mr Bruce, my suggestion is<br> that you now make a request<br> for a continuance,<br> for the purpose of retaining new counsel.<br> If you do, then I will so grant that request.<br> I just want a chance to talk to the court,<br> just to talk to you without all<br> the legal double-talking bullshit.<br> You are making this very difficult for me.<br> Sorry, but attorneys keep telling me<br> "Don't worry, it's just the Lower Court,<br> they're all assholes. "<br> "We'll win in a higher court. "<br> I shouldn't lose here.<br> I'm not doing anything wrong.<br> Would you please sit down?<br> - I do have the right to say things.<br> - I am running out of patience!<br> If you'd just let me do my act<br> for the court, I'll take my chances.<br> If after you hear me,<br> if you don't think it's funny,<br> if you think it has no redeeming<br> social value, if it strikes you as dirty...<br> I cannot allow this to continue!<br> Your Honour... I so want your respect.<br> I know you're a good person<br> and this legal system<br> is the best in the world,<br> but you... you can't seem to hear me!<br> - Sit down!<br> - When I'm talking about tits and ass,<br> I'm not up there to shock<br> the audience by repeating<br> "tits and ass, ass and tits,<br> tits and ass!"<br> The point is that we all live<br> in a hypocritical society!<br> You leave me no alternative but<br> to find you in contempt of this court!<br> OK.<br> Then sentence me. I have no money left.<br> Might I be sentenced now?<br> I can't afford to be on trial.<br> The police took away my cabaret card.<br> I can't work any more.<br> - Please, sentence me.<br> - No, I will not sentence you today.<br> I order you, when you appear before me<br> again, to appear with suitable counsel.<br> And I am further ordering psychiatric<br> evaluation by the psychiatric clinic.<br> - December 16th. Bail continued.<br> - You're trying to stop the information!<br> Bailiff, will you remove<br> this man from the courtroom?<br> Court adjourned!<br> .. the information<br> keeps the country strong!<br> You need the deviate! Don't shut him up!<br> You need that madman to stand up,<br> tell you when you're blowing it!<br> The harder you come down on him,<br> the more you need him!<br> Please! Don't take away my words!<br> They're just words!<br> I'm not hurting anybody!<br> He was found guilty in New York<br> and sentenced to four months, right?<br> Yes.<br> - He was frightened of being confined?<br> - Yes.<br> Among his belongings,<br> they found a letter from the bank,<br> that said he had lost the house.<br> Do you suppose those things and that<br> letter had anything to do with his death?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> See you Saturday.<br> Get some sleep and do something<br> about that weight.<br> Yeah, you're right.<br> I'm gonna go on a diet. Bye-bye.<br> Bye, man.<br> I know where you're trying<br> to take this, and it's just not so.<br> He'd never do a thing like that.<br> Anyway...<br> Anyway, why was he<br> trying to lose weight?<br> I loved him. I really loved him.<br> I'm very happy that his records<br> are starting to sell again.<br> He was nutty, you know?<br> He did a lot of crazy things.<br> And we were always doing bits<br> to crack each other up.<br> Doesn't it strike you as rather ironic that<br> the things that Lenny was arrested for<br> would be considered<br> fairly harmless today?<br> Well, like, um,<br> I don't really know about that.<br> I mean...<br> He was just so damn funny.<br> You know I'm negotiating<br> for a film based on his life?<br> I got all the rights tied up.<br> Oh, listen, I'm afraid<br> that's all the time I have.<br> I have to get out to the Valley,<br> catch a comic.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - It was a pleasure.<br> Into the shithouse for good<br> this time. Forget it. Oh, man. Forget it.<br>
