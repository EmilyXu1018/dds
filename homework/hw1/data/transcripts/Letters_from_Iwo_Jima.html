                        Letters From Iwo Jima<br> IWO JIMA<br> How did those soldiers ever manage<br> to dig out these tunnels?<br> Let's get a rotation in here.<br> Hey, I found something!<br> IWO JIMA<br> Hanako...<br> We soldiers dig.<br> We dig all day.<br> This is the hole that we will fight...<br> and die in.<br> Hanako...<br> am I digging my own grave?<br> Today, I head for the post<br> where my men await.<br> I am determined to serve<br> and give my life for my country.<br> I believe I have organized<br> everything at home...<br> but I am sorry I wasn 't able to attend<br> to the kitchen floor before I left.<br> I had all the intention...<br> but had to leave<br> without having the time...<br> and I am still worried about it.<br> So make sure to have<br> Taro take care of it promptly.<br> Damn this island!<br> The Americans can have it.<br> Nothing grows here.<br> It smells. It's hot. There are too many<br> damn bugs, and there's no water.<br> This island is part<br> of Japan's sacred homeland.<br> There's nothing sacred about this island.<br> Saigo.<br> We should just give the island<br> to the Americans...<br> and then we can go home.<br> Saigo!<br> What did you say, soldier?<br> I said if we beat the Americans,<br> then we can go home.<br> You there, is that what he said?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm Kuribayashi.<br> Welcome, General.<br> I am Admiral Ohsugi.<br> How long have you been<br> waiting here for me?<br> Three hours, sir.<br> Sorry to hear that.<br> They wouldn't allow me<br> to wire my arrival...<br> after what happened<br> to Admiral Yamamoto.<br> I understand, sir.<br> This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.<br> What's the matter, Admiral?<br> You don't look very well.<br> It's nothing, sir. The water<br> doesn't agree with me here.<br> Sorry to hear that.<br> This way to your quarters.<br> Admiral, I want to make a round<br> of the island first.<br> Shall I fetch a vehicle?<br> No, let's walk.<br> Walking is good for the health.<br> It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.<br> So that's Suribachi.<br> You unpatriotic...<br> no-good peasants!<br> Hey, stop it!<br> Stand up!<br> What are you doing?<br> These soldiers...<br> were conspiring<br> with unpatriotic words, sir.<br> I see.<br> And, Captain, do you have<br> such an excess of soldiers...<br> that you could put two<br> of them out of commission?<br> No, sir.<br> Then stop beating them.<br> Deny their lunch rations instead.<br> A good captain uses his brain,<br> not just his whip.<br> What is all this?<br> All this?<br> Trenches, sir.<br> Why are the men digging trenches here?<br> This is where the Americans<br> are expected to land.<br> Have them stop immediately.<br> But, General...<br> And, Captain...<br> make sure these men get proper breaks.<br> They look like they're from Mars.<br> Stop digging!<br> Just as well.<br> My stomach has been<br> bothering me anyway.<br> A toast to General Kuribayashi...<br> a fine commander.<br> Better than sake!<br> I heard he lived in America.<br> Maybe that's why he<br> doesn't want us digging trenches.<br> Maybe he likes Americans.<br> No, stupid.<br> He studied the Americans.<br> So now he knows how to beat them.<br> I heard from someone in the 204th...<br> that another general was<br> supposed to command the island...<br> but he didn't want the job.<br> So Premier Tojo gave it<br> to Kuribayashi instead.<br> Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...<br> but your ears are full of wax!<br> Anyway, you can't trust anyone<br> from the 204th.<br> They're part of the Navy.<br> I think this Kuribayashi<br> must be a superb general.<br> Look...<br> we're not digging those damn trenches<br> in the sand anymore, are we?<br> This heat is more than I had anticipated.<br> This island is bigger than I thought.<br> I'm exhausted.<br> Ito, reporting for duty.<br> Thank you for coming right away.<br> How much air force<br> do we have available?<br> Is that all?<br> In order to support Saipan,<br> we lost 66 planes a few days ago.<br> We will have to rely on support<br> from the Combined Fleet then.<br> Is this the current defense plan?<br> And what about the Army troops?<br> Where will they be stationed?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> They are under independent<br> command of Colonel Adachi.<br> You have not coordinated<br> your plans with the Army?<br> According to Navy rules,<br> until the enemy lands...<br> This is a real war!<br> You are aware of that, aren't you?<br> This will not work.<br> You are concentrating all<br> your efforts on the beaches.<br> - Move the artillery to higher ground.<br> - But, sir, we just had them...<br> moved down to the beaches.<br> Well, move them back.<br> Coordinate with the Army<br> and have them start immediately.<br> Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.<br> I'm going to walk some more.<br> - It's pitch black out there, sir.<br> - I know.<br> This one is trouble.<br> Army commanders usually are, sir.<br> Another letter?<br> You know that the mail only goes out<br> when there's a boat available?<br> I have a lot of family.<br> Then how come all your letters<br> are addressed to your wife?<br> Nosey!<br> Here, let me do you a favor.<br> Otherwise, your letters<br> will never make it through.<br> Hey, what are you doing?<br> I used to work at the censorship office<br> in Tokyo before I was transferred.<br> You mean demoted.<br> "To Hanako: We soldiers dig.<br> We dig all day."<br> No, no, no. This will never pass.<br> Give me that back!<br> There. You'll thank me<br> for this later, Saigo.<br> Next!<br> Good!<br> Are you blind?<br> Can't you see the target?<br> Even my six-year-old could<br> shoot better than you do.<br> Do it again!<br> You're an embarrassment!<br> You call yourself an Imperial soldier?<br> Tonight you will clean the boots<br> of your entire troop.<br> Go to the rear!<br> They should learn to clean their guns<br> properly, rather than their boots.<br> What are those tanks doing here?<br> Those are out of commission, sir.<br> They are waiting for parts.<br> - For how long?<br> - About a month, sir.<br> Taro, America is filled with cars.<br> I have to be very careful<br> when I cross the street...<br> there are so many cars everywhere.<br> Taro, are you behaving yourself<br> and listening to your mother?<br> I miss you.<br> These civilians need to be<br> evacuated as soon as possible.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hanako...<br> we have a celebrity here.<br> Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist<br> in horse jumping.<br> He will lead the 26th tank regiment...<br> and has just arrived from Tokyo.<br> Nishi is very handsome, and there are<br> rumors of his womanizing skills.<br> But there are no women<br> left on the island to woo.<br> Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!<br> You brought your horse.<br> From Chichi Jima.<br> I used to be a cavalryman myself,<br> you know.<br> Of course, I know.<br> I've been looking forward<br> to serving under you.<br> One who understands horses<br> the way I do.<br> When we used to ride horses<br> through the battlefield...<br> those were the good old days...<br> not like these mechanized contraptions.<br> I could send for another horse...<br> and we could ride together.<br> I'm afraid my riding days are over.<br> But tell me about this famous horse<br> of yours that you won the Olympics with.<br> My stallion, Uranus.<br> Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.<br> I bought him in Italy.<br> They were happy to get rid of him.<br> He was such a wild horse.<br> No one could tame the beast,<br> but I told them...<br> such a headstrong horse...<br> is a perfect match for me.<br> Come dine with me tonight.<br> I feel like having a drink.<br> I think that can be arranged.<br> How did you manage to get<br> the Johnnie Walker?<br> I drank some already.<br> I'm sorry. This is all we have.<br> That's fine, as long as we have this.<br> What is this empty plate?<br> I have told our cook that all officers...<br> will have the same rations<br> and food as our men.<br> I'm sorry, but serving three dishes<br> is regulation.<br> Oh, but of course we have the right to be<br> served more than three dishes per meal.<br> You're absolutely right.<br> When you think about it...<br> it is regrettable that most of the<br> Combined Fleet was destroyed.<br> We still have some battleships left...<br> but we have very little striking power<br> from the air or sea.<br> Nishi, what do you mean?<br> So you have not heard about<br> the Mariana battle?<br> Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes<br> were destroyed.<br> The Imperial headquarters...<br> is deceiving not just the people,<br> but us as well.<br> If you want my honest opinion, General...<br> the best thing to do...<br> would be to sink the island<br> to the bottom of the sea.<br> And yet, you still came?<br> Well...<br> I figured your men were going to need<br> all the tanks that I could bring.<br> This must be it.<br> Yes, the enemy must land here.<br> Run!<br> Like you were one of the Americans!<br> Go on! Which direction would you take?<br> Hey...<br> I think your general has gone mad.<br> Look at the gun he has.<br> He probably took it<br> from a dead American.<br> Maybe.<br> Break time is over.<br> Back to work!<br> Are you all right, Kashiwara?<br> You look pale.<br> I'm fine. It's just the damn water.<br> But... I... really... need to go.<br> There will be a major change<br> in our strategy.<br> We will dig caves in the Motoyama,<br> Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.<br> We will build these underground<br> fortifications, and fight to the end.<br> - What about the beach defenses, sir?<br> - Not needed.<br> But, sir, the beach trenches<br> are our first line of defense.<br> Without the beach trenches,<br> how do you expect us to win?<br> Hayashi, do you know how many cars<br> America produces in a year?<br> Five million.<br> The Americans' technological<br> advancements cannot be underestimated.<br> They will cross the beaches eventually.<br> If we waste our soldiers there,<br> there is no hope for victory.<br> It is inevitable that men will die...<br> but I never heard of an island operation<br> without beach fortifications.<br> General, it will be a futile waste of time<br> to start digging tunnels now.<br> We should force the enemy<br> near the island...<br> and launch a pincer drive<br> from the sea and air.<br> I agree. That makes the most sense.<br> Ohsugi...<br> doesn't the Navy know?<br> The Combined Fleet has been completely<br> destroyed off the Marianas.<br> The island is now isolated.<br> What's more, I received a new order from<br> the Imperial headquarters this morning.<br> The remaining fighter planes<br> are to be sent back...<br> to Tokyo to defend the mainland.<br> Outrageous! How are we to fight?<br> We do not have time for discussion.<br> We should head back.<br> Dear Mother...<br> I have been commissioned<br> to a new troop today.<br> I cannot talk about this transfer now.<br> Take good care of yourself.<br> Look at this picture.<br> That's some fancy castle.<br> You know who this castle was built for?<br> Someone who was already dead.<br> They must have had<br> a lot of money back then...<br> to build a castle like that<br> for a dead person.<br> Why are you reading that book anyway?<br> We're never going to war over there.<br> We'll be lucky if we even get<br> a hole in the ground when we're dead.<br> Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.<br> Is this the 312th?<br> That's right.<br> I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.<br> Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.<br> There's an empty space in the back.<br> Don't mind him.<br> His friend Kashiwara just died.<br> That used to be his spot.<br> But we are all going to die.<br> That's the plan, isn't it?<br> For our country, it is an honor.<br> Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.<br> Shimizu, where are you from?<br> Kanagawa-ken.<br> Ozawa is from there, aren't you?<br> That's right.<br> Where were you trained?<br> Maybe we were at the same school?<br> No.<br> I trained in Tokyo.<br> I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?<br> The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.<br> Hey...<br> why do you think they put<br> a Kempeitai in our unit?<br> I don't know.<br> He's not wearing the white armband.<br> He's not Kempeitai.<br> He went to the Kempeitai<br> military academy.<br> Maybe he was kicked out.<br> He acts like a Kempeitai.<br> Look at his holster.<br> That's not standard issue.<br> He's been put here to spy on us.<br> Why would he spy on us?<br> Maybe it's those letters<br> you've been writing.<br> You should be careful.<br> Weed soup again?<br> Kuribayashi is conserving<br> our food supplies for the battle.<br> We'll be dead<br> before the Americans even get here.<br> And you would think that with all my<br> war effort contributions...<br> we should be eating kasutera cakes<br> or sandwiches.<br> What?<br> I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.<br> Back when we could still get sugar...<br> we sold ampan and kasutera cakes.<br> However, his Kempeitai brethren...<br> used to come and take<br> whatever they wanted.<br> For the war...<br> For the country...<br> Why bread?<br> We ran into those types<br> at our clothing store as well.<br> When we started making sandwiches...<br> they took those, too.<br> And when we ran out of meat<br> and just had bread, they still came.<br> Eventually, they took all of our<br> baking equipment for the metal...<br> and we were out of business.<br> I should have been a fisherman.<br> It must have been hard on your wife...<br> without the shop<br> and without her husband.<br> Tell them to go away.<br> We have nothing to sell.<br> Congratulations! Your husband<br> is going to war.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'm happy to serve the country.<br> Prayers for your eternal success at arms.<br> I beg of you! We have only each other.<br> This is not the time.<br> We have all sent our husbands<br> and sons to war.<br> We all have to do our part.<br> At least you'll have a little one<br> to carry on your name.<br> I can't eat with you like that.<br> What am I going to do after you die?<br> I'm not in the coffin yet.<br> The men never come home,<br> not even a soul.<br> They'll never let you come home.<br> Don't worry.<br> And now, with the baby.<br> Can you hear me?<br> It's Dad.<br> Listen.<br> Don't tell anyone<br> what I'm telling you now.<br> It's a secret.<br> Your dad...<br> is going to come home for you.<br> Hurry up!<br> The enemy approaches!<br> This is ridiculous!<br> Why waste time digging these tunnels?<br> They are all going to die anyway.<br> At least he conceded<br> to the pillboxes on the beach.<br> You wanted to see me, sir?<br> Care for a drink?<br> You have been looking<br> quite pale these days.<br> It's the water. It has<br> never agreed with me.<br> That's not good.<br> Why don't you go back<br> to the mainland to recoup?<br> I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru<br> to take your place.<br> We are wasting time<br> digging these tunnels.<br> General, the island won't last<br> five days without fleet support.<br> We should fight to the death.<br> The tunnel-digging may be futile.<br> Maybe the stand on Iwo will be futile.<br> Maybe the whole war is futile.<br> But will you give up then?<br> We will defend this island<br> until we are dead!<br> Until the very last soldier is dead!<br> If our children can live safely<br> for one more day...<br> it would be worth the one more day<br> that we defend this island!<br> Ohsugi...<br> if you have an ounce<br> of pride left as an officer...<br> I beg of you...<br> go back to headquarters<br> and ask them to send support.<br> So the rumor is true?<br> I couldn't believe it.<br> I'm grateful to be leaving this island.<br> We may have had our differences...<br> but I'm truly sorry to see you go.<br> General Hayashi, it is up to you now.<br> Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,<br> not commanding war.<br> I understand.<br> There are many of us<br> who agree with you, sir.<br> Listen.<br> The Americans are likely to land here.<br> Crossfire positions will be here...<br> here...<br> and here.<br> The fact is...<br> we are completely<br> outnumbered in every sector.<br> But we have a great advantage.<br> Can anyone tell me what that is?<br> The Americans are weak-willed<br> and inferior to Japanese soldiers.<br> Very good, Shimizu.<br> Why is that?<br> They are not as disciplined...<br> and they let their emotions<br> interfere with their duty.<br> That is correct.<br> Here is the uniform<br> of an American medic.<br> He should be your target.<br> For Americans will risk the lives<br> of many soldiers to save this one.<br> Understood?<br> General, may I speak with you?<br> Please keep an eye on<br> Major General Hayashi.<br> Thank you for your concern, Nishi...<br> but we don't have any time to waste.<br> We must think about what<br> we can do at this moment.<br> Admiral Ichimaru.<br> Reporting for duty, sir.<br> Excuse me.<br> Thank you for coming<br> on such short notice.<br> Jupiter!<br> Jupiter.<br> Yamazaki...<br> what are you doing just<br> sitting there? Help us...<br> I think he's writing about us<br> in his reports.<br> He's just writing a letter.<br> It's been two months, Nozaki.<br> He would have reported us by now.<br> How can you be sure?<br> Will they ever stop?<br> Day and night, day and night...<br> It's driving me crazy!<br> If the damn Americans<br> are going to invade...<br> why don't they hurry up and land?<br> Tako-Chan...<br> the four chicks that were born<br> two months ago have grown so much.<br> The mother chicken leads them<br> for food every day...<br> but they're giving me a hard time, picking<br> at the vegetable garden I have grown.<br> The fleet of American ships<br> has left Saipan.<br> So they are on their way.<br> Ready the troops.<br> Men...<br> the time has come<br> to show your true colors.<br> As a member of the honorable<br> Imperial Army...<br> I trust that you will fight with honor.<br> This island is of utmost importance<br> to Japan.<br> Should the island fall...<br> the enemy...<br> will use it as their base<br> to attack our homeland.<br> For the mainland...<br> For our homeland...<br> Until the very last man.<br> Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.<br> Not one of you...<br> is allowed to die until you have killed<br> Do not expect to return home alive.<br> I will always be in front of you.<br> Long live the Emperor.<br> Take care and be well.<br> I will fight courageously until the end,<br> in the spirit of Yamato.<br> My heart will always be with you.<br> Takeichi.<br> Every household is assigned a quota<br> of bag-making for the gunpowder.<br> I cannot help but get tense when I think<br> that these will be used in battle.<br> Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.<br> Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,<br> is also doing well.<br> I pray for your safety.<br> Sincerely, Yoshi.<br> No one can shoot me now.<br> That's a nice belt.<br> My wife sent me one, too.<br> Doesn't look like Mr. Kempeitai<br> has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?<br> Maybe he thinks it will clash<br> with his uniform.<br> He probably doesn't believe<br> in superstitions, anyway.<br> His mother made him one after all.<br> - Maybe they're trying to sink the island.<br> - My head hurts.<br> How many ships do you think<br> there are out there?<br> At least 30. Maybe even 50.<br> - They must be really close.<br> - I need to take a leak.<br> Don't go near the sewers.<br> Dysentery is spreading through there.<br> Where do I go then?<br> There is a pot at the end of the cave.<br> The shit pot is full.<br> Someone needs to throw it out.<br> If anything happens to that pot...<br> you'll be carrying our shit away<br> with your hands.<br> Is this some kind of a joke?<br> Why are you always picking on me?<br> Thank you, God. I take back<br> what I said before.<br> Shall we commence fire?<br> Not yet.<br> The men wish to commence firing.<br> Hold your fire!<br> Hold your fire!<br> Hold your fire!<br> They will take the beach<br> in no time if we do not resist.<br> Wait until the beach is full.<br> Let's go. Commence firing!<br> Commence firing!<br> Commence firing!<br> The guns of the Kitakubo unit<br> were destroyed.<br> All the pillbox units on the beach<br> have been destroyed.<br> However, all other forces are intact...<br> and we estimate more than<br> The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.<br> Overall, that is good news.<br> How are the men<br> holding up at Suribachi?<br> Forces are intact.<br> What is the enemy situation?<br> Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.<br> There has to be more than that.<br> They still have men waiting in the boats.<br> Currently the enemy front extends...<br> between Suribachi<br> and the south landing...<br> and Chidori airfield south.<br> Just as I thought... Suribachi<br> and the Motoyama airfield.<br> They are making a two-pronged attack.<br> That's not enough! I need more ammo.<br> Take his place!<br> - The machine gun is blasted.<br> - Use your rifle!<br> Watch out! Imbecile!<br> I can't rely on you.<br> Go send a report to Colonel Adachi<br> that we need another machine gun.<br> Hurry up!<br> Colonel Adachi is asking<br> for reinforcements.<br> We can't afford to send reinforcements.<br> Tell him to hold out.<br> Shoot him!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - We're out of bullets!<br> We are losing Suribachi.<br> All is lost. Request permission<br> to lead a suicide mission.<br> No. You must try to hold them off.<br> Do what you can to survive<br> and join forces in the north caves.<br> But, sir...<br> I have failed to hold Suribachi.<br> Permit me to die with honor with<br> my men.<br> No, Colonel.<br> This is an order!<br> Adachi.<br> Adachi!<br> Sir, Captain Tanida<br> requests machine guns.<br> It's over.<br> Suicide...<br> That's the only thing left.<br> But...<br> Here, take this to your commander.<br> I heard General Kuribayashi<br> order Colonel Adachi to escape.<br> Quiet!<br> Escape is the coward's way.<br> Sit down!<br> Men...<br> we are...<br> honorable soldiers of the Emperor.<br> Don't ever forget that.<br> The only way left for us...<br> is to die with honor.<br> This is our fate...<br> to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.<br> I'll see you there.<br> Soldiers, farewell!<br> Stop!<br> You should die like an honorable soldier.<br> Look, Shimizu...<br> we can still join the troops<br> in the northern caves.<br> Our orders are to stay here until death.<br> I heard General Kuribayashi himself.<br> That's what he said...<br> over the radio.<br> It's true.<br> We can die here...<br> or we can continue fighting.<br> Which would better serve the Emperor?<br> Which one?<br> Where does this go?<br> It will take us closer to Motoyama.<br> Do you have orders to move back?<br> Where are the rest of your men?<br> All dead.<br> It's the same with us.<br> There should be an outlet<br> somewhere near here.<br> Be quiet!<br> So you thought you could blow us up,<br> or burn us alive, did you?<br> - Have we heard from Suribachi?<br> - No, sir.<br> Send a messenger!<br> Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us<br> to rendezvous at the east cave.<br> We will make a run for Motoyama.<br> There is no cover for two kilometers.<br> It will be every man for himself.<br> See you on the other side.<br> If not on this earth,<br> then in the next world.<br> Don't run with the herd.<br> That's where the enemy will fire.<br> Stay back.<br> That's cowardice!<br> There is no use for a dead soldier.<br> Wait until the flare is gone.<br> Crawl forward.<br> What happened to the messenger?<br> He never came back.<br> I will go to Adachi myself.<br> Motoyama's transmitter<br> still works, General.<br> Why not try there, sir?<br> Sir, these men retreated<br> from Mt. Suribachi.<br> What are your names?<br> Saigo, from the 312th.<br> Shimizu, reporting for duty.<br> You escaped from Suribachi?<br> How dare you!<br> It was your duty<br> to stay in your position until death.<br> You should have died...<br> with your fellow troop members.<br> You are both a disgrace.<br> Get on your knees.<br> - But, sir...<br> - I said, get on your knees!<br> I don't want you to kill<br> my soldiers needlessly.<br> Put down your sword.<br> Put it down!<br> What's going on here?<br> These men ran from Suribachi.<br> Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors<br> retreat to the north caves.<br> I am very sorry, General.<br> It's just...<br> Suribachi...<br> has fallen.<br> Now that Suribachi has been taken...<br> the enemy will maneuver all forces<br> onto the hillside.<br> We must move<br> our command center north, sir.<br> Ito...<br> fight for your fallen brethren...<br> until the end.<br> Get up!<br> Major General Hayashi<br> is leading an attack.<br> We are to join him.<br> Kuribayashi's orders are<br> to remain in the caves.<br> Lieutenant Ito says Kuribayashi<br> is a weak American sympathizer.<br> We will take back Mt. Suribachi.<br> Where is Major General Hayashi?<br> We don't know, sir.<br> Who is in charge here?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Stay here until<br> I determine the plan of action.<br> We're dead.<br> Pull back!<br> We'll get reinforcements.<br> Why didn't your regiment join the attack?<br> Don't sit here like rats!<br> Come out of your caves and fight!<br> Where is your commander?<br> We haven't received the order to attack.<br> Didn't you receive the order<br> from General Hayashi?<br> Kuribayashi countermanded<br> Hayashi's order.<br> There is to be no attack.<br> We will take back Suribachi...<br> with or without Kuribayashi.<br> There are already troops on the attack.<br> Get your men in order.<br> Lieutenant, may I remind you<br> of your rank!<br> Your disrespect for senior officers...<br> puts your men at needless risk.<br> I suggest you go back to your cave...<br> or hand over your men.<br> Enough.<br> We'll do it ourselves.<br> That's against regulations.<br> That's the officer who tried to kill us.<br> He doesn't care.<br> I won't go back.<br> I've had enough of cave fighting.<br> You men are now under<br> Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.<br> I will throw myself under an enemy tank.<br> I will take out one of their machines.<br> Hurry.<br> What is the status?<br> A thousand men were lost...<br> in a night attack along Chidori airfield.<br> Why? I have given them strict orders<br> not to kill themselves.<br> It seems that the order to retreat<br> was not conveyed to all sectors.<br> Hayashi.<br> Damn you!<br> And the American advancement?<br> A battalion is headed north and we<br> are fighting back along the west ridge.<br> Good. Once they cross the west ridge,<br> they will be surrounded on three sides.<br> This just arrived.<br> Read it.<br> From headquarters...<br> "We regret that we are unable to send<br> reinforcements to Iwo at this time.<br> We earnestly hope you will<br> fight honorably...<br> and die for your country."<br> Bring him in.<br> Bring him in.<br> Shall I finish him off?<br> No. Treat him.<br> But, sir...<br> Okubo, you would expect the same,<br> wouldn't you?<br> Endo, treat him.<br> We are low on morphine as it is.<br> Sir, the Americans would not treat<br> a wounded Japanese soldier.<br> Son, have you ever met one?<br> Treat him.<br> Where are you, American tanks?<br> Come and get me!<br> How is the prisoner doing?<br> He is awake, sir.<br> I will question the prisoner<br> for information.<br> Damn.<br> I've had enough of this.<br> I'm going to surrender.<br> Go ahead and arrest me.<br> I don't care anymore. That's what<br> you were put here for, isn't it?<br> To report treasonous thoughts.<br> I was put here because...<br> I was discharged from the Kempeitai.<br> Discharged?<br> I had only been in service<br> for five days.<br> Shimizu...<br> you must always be firm.<br> Any mercy and people<br> will take advantage of you.<br> That's unpatriotic.<br> Go sort it out, Shimizu.<br> You do not have the Imperial flag<br> properly displayed.<br> I'm sorry.<br> My husband has gone to war<br> and I couldn't put it up myself.<br> It is unpatriotic<br> not to have the flag displayed.<br> If you help me, I'll put it up now.<br> Get that dog to shut up.<br> What was that, sir?<br> That dog is a nuisance.<br> It is disruptive of Army communications.<br> I am very sorry, sir.<br> Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.<br> We can't have a dog interfering<br> with important military commands.<br> Take the dog in the back.<br> It's only a dog.<br> It won't happen again.<br> Take it out back.<br> Keep the children inside.<br> Hurry up.<br> Take the dog into the house<br> and keep him quiet...<br> and never let him out.<br> It's taken care of, sir.<br> Are you trying to make a fool out of me?<br> If you can't even shoot a dog,<br> you'll never be able to handle the Reds.<br> You are unpatriotic!<br> I was discharged for insubordination...<br> and sent here.<br> Don't look so glum, Shimizu.<br> At least now only the enemy hates you.<br> I don't blame the dog.<br> Taro...<br> tonight I attended my farewell party.<br> The wives also attended,<br> so there was a lot of fuss.<br> Greeting all the ladies...<br> kept me from enjoying the food.<br> Is there any information<br> of the enemy's plan?<br> No, it's just a letter.<br> It's from his mother.<br> "Sam...<br> I have mailed you<br> a couple of books to read.<br> I hope that you like them.<br> Yesterday...<br> the dogs dug a hole under the fence.<br> They ran all over the neighborhood.<br> By the time we found them...<br> the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.<br> Don't worry about us.<br> Just take care of yourself<br> and come back safely.<br> Remember what I said to you...<br> always do what is right...<br> because it is right.<br> I pray for a speedy end to the war...<br> and your safe return.<br> Love, Mom."<br> I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.<br> It's all right. I'm useless now.<br> Go help the others!<br> Okubo, come here.<br> How are we on ammunition?<br> Not good, sir.<br> Our mortars have been taken out...<br> and we're out of machine gun ammo.<br> We have only our rifles.<br> Okubo...<br> you are now in charge of the men.<br> We can no longer hold this area.<br> You must guide<br> the rest of the men north.<br> Take whatever food and ammo<br> we have left.<br> What about you, sir?<br> I'm tired of sharing this cave<br> with all of you.<br> I'm a one-man show from here on out.<br> What are you talking about, sir?<br> Your first order of business...<br> is to find some water.<br> Men...<br> do your best.<br> Do what is right...<br> because it is right.<br> Understood?<br> I will make sure that they send you<br> medicine and food.<br> It has been a great honor...<br> to serve...<br> under you.<br> Hand me my rifle.<br> I'm sorry, Okubo.<br> Why am I not getting any reports?<br> Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?<br> - No, sir.<br> - What about Nishi or Hayashi?<br> - Send out messengers!<br> - We have. Many times.<br> None of them have come back.<br> You can't plan strategy like this!<br> I have been thinking about<br> what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.<br> He's right.<br> I don't know anything about the enemy.<br> I believed that the Americans<br> were cowards...<br> but they weren't.<br> I was taught...<br> that they were savages...<br> but that American soldier...<br> his mother's words...<br> were the same as my mother's.<br> I want to fulfill my duty<br> for the general...<br> and our country...<br> but I don't want to die for nothing.<br> What do you think?<br> You...<br> haven't lived enough to realize...<br> what you are sacrificing.<br> Will you surrender with me?<br> Careful.<br> They'll notice if we leave together.<br> You go first.<br> I'll make up an excuse.<br> After a while, I'll tell them<br> I'm going to check on you.<br> We'll be gone before they even notice.<br> Pretend that you have dysentery.<br> Give me your dysentery look.<br> I guess that'll have to do.<br> Where are you going?<br> I've got dysentery.<br> You're going to surrender, aren't you?<br> If you are, take me with you.<br> - I've had enough of this war.<br> - Be quiet!<br> Where are you going?<br> He said he wasn't feeling well.<br> It could be dysentery.<br> You two! Stop!<br> Sir, maybe they got spooked.<br> Miura, you're on guard.<br> Make sure we have no more deserters.<br> What unit were you with?<br> Higashiyama 314th.<br> Did you hear...<br> I heard that they would give you a meal.<br> A meal...<br> That sounds good.<br> I'm from Yokohama, too.<br> After this is over, you can come visit me.<br> Lieutenant!<br> Let this be a lesson to anyone else...<br> who wants to surrender.<br> We need to get through the crossfire<br> to reach the north...<br> and join our forces at the front.<br> Listen.<br> We'll head for that cave<br> and make our way from there.<br> Don't waste a bullet!<br> Not a single one.<br> Don't shoot recklessly.<br> These are Nishi's troops<br> and the survivors from Suribachi.<br> Are there no officers?<br> You all did a good job making it here.<br> Fujita, water for them.<br> I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.<br> I'm sorry.<br> At least you can rest.<br> You look familiar.<br> You almost lost your head.<br> That was the second time you saved me.<br> The first time...<br> was the day you landed on the island.<br> Of course. I remember.<br> Well, everything happens in threes.<br> Hanako...<br> This letter will probably<br> never get to you...<br> but...<br> it comforts me to write.<br> For five days, we've been<br> without water and food.<br> To survive...<br> we do unspeakable things.<br> There is no escape now.<br> But...<br> my only concern is for you and the baby.<br> Dig up some worms.<br> The battle is approaching its end...<br> and there is no more ammunition,<br> no more water.<br> All the survivors will engage<br> in a general attack.<br> I pray for the victory<br> and safety of the Empire.<br> I bid you farewell.<br> For the country,<br> I could not fulfill all of my duties.<br> Now that we have no ammunition,<br> it is with regret that we must perish.<br> You made it all the way from Suribachi?<br> That must have been quite a journey.<br> You are quite a soldier.<br> No, sir.<br> I'm just a simple baker.<br> You were a baker?<br> Any family?<br> A wife...<br> and a baby girl born<br> last summer in Ohmiya.<br> I haven't met her yet.<br> It's strange.<br> I promised myself to fight<br> until death for my family...<br> but the thought of my family<br> makes it difficult to keep that promise.<br> A radio transmission from the homeland.<br> For General Kuribayashi...<br> and his troops, who are fighting bravely<br> for our country...<br> a song will be sung by the children<br> of Nagano...<br> which is Kuribayashi's hometown.<br> On the waves of the Pacific<br> down south from the Imperial City<br> a small lonely island floats<br> The fate of our Imperial country<br> lies in the hands of this island<br> Iwo Jima<br> As long as we stand<br> we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land<br> shall forever be at peace<br> We shall fight with pride<br> and honor at any price<br> Our proud island<br> Iwo Jima<br> Do me a favor.<br> Stay here and burn all these documents,<br> and my military chest.<br> Everything happens in threes.<br> We will make a general attack.<br> Although Japan has lost...<br> one day...<br> our people will praise your dedication.<br> A day will come when they<br> will weep and pray for your souls.<br> Be proud to die for your country.<br> I will always be in front of you.<br> No more.<br> No more.<br> Thank you, Fujita.<br> This is an order.<br> You again.<br> I have one more favor to ask of you.<br> Bury me...<br> so that no one will find me.<br> Taro...<br> I will be home soon.<br> I'm glad to be going back to Japan...<br> but I'm a bit sad<br> to leave my friends behind.<br> I drove home...<br> but...<br> it's lonely driving all by myself.<br> Is this still Japanese soil?<br> This is still Japan.<br> Just put the shovel down.<br> Be careful.<br>
