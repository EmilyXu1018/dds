                        "LIBELED LADY"<br> Press Room.<br> Okay.<br> Hold everything for a new front page!<br> We're jimmying the Allenbury yarn.<br> Hey, Mack, hold everything.<br> Wait for a makeover.<br> - What happened, Allen?<br> - Don't load anymore.<br> - Hold it, boys.<br> - Unload all of them.<br> We're trying to kill a story.<br> Have any trucks gone out?<br> - How about it, Joe?<br> - Number 7.<br> Call him back.<br> But he's gone.<br> Times Square and Columbus Circle.<br> Rush a motorcycle after him. Hurry up!<br> We've got to get those papers back.<br> Every one.<br> Pete, get on your machine<br> and stop truck number 7.<br> Okay.<br> Phone all the stands on that route<br> not to sell any papers.<br> Are you ringing Haggerty?<br> All right, all right! Try him again.<br> - Go to Haggerty's apartment. 52nd Street...<br> - I know where he lives.<br> Won't he be at church?<br> Isn't he getting married at noon?<br> You grab a taxi to the church.<br> Bring him here.<br> - I can't ruin his wedding.<br> - Then it'll be our funeral.<br> Step on it! Keep on ringing him.<br> Don't answer it. I've had enough gags<br> pulled on me this morning.<br> Maybe Miss Benton again. I'm afraid...<br> You're afraid? I'm marrying her,<br> and you're afraid.<br> That's loyalty.<br> She say before, "If you're late,<br> she going tear down church."<br> Even that won't stop it.<br> No, Ching, I promised I'd meet her<br> at the altar at the stroke of 12:00.<br> And there'll be no reprieve<br> from the governor this time.<br> - I hope you'll be very happy.<br> - Yes, said the spider to the fly.<br> - Very pretty.<br> - I'm the groom, not the bride.<br> Take my advice, Ching.<br> Don't ever get married.<br> Maybe not so bad, Mr. Haggerty.<br> My mother and father, they get married.<br> You're kidding.<br> Here's to the last mile.<br> A merry marriage<br> and many happy comebacks.<br> Mr. Haggerty!<br> - What's wrong?<br> - You're wanted at the office right away.<br> Good old governor. Good old office!<br> Run to the church<br> and tell Miss Benton I've been delayed.<br> It's awful to bust up your wedding.<br> Never mind the wedding.<br> Something break?<br> - The story they had to kill.<br> - What story?<br> The London correspondent<br> cabled last night.<br> A swell story on the Allenbury girl.<br> Connie Allenbury? What kind of story?<br> She was mixed up<br> in some scrape at a garden party.<br> Tried to steal another girl's husband.<br> - Not Connie Allenbury?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All right, what happened?<br> Jackson cabled this morning.<br> It was all a mistake.<br> It was somebody else.<br> She wasn't at the party.<br> And we printed the story?<br> Holy mackerel! Come on.<br> Wait. You said not to stop for anything...<br> but you've got to have your pants.<br> Yeah, yeah. I gotta have my pants.<br> Can't I stay away for one day<br> without somebody pulling a boner?<br> You call yourself a newspaperman.<br> Where's your nose?<br> - My nose?<br> - Yes, your nose!<br> That thing fairly reeks of alcohol!<br> Jackson was drunk.<br> You got to smell things like that.<br> You don't need any brains.<br> All you need is a nose!<br> - I knew the boss hated her father...<br> - And her father hates us!<br> He'd blow us up,<br> and you hand him dynamite.<br> The one girl that we should handle<br> with kid gloves...<br> and you spread her name<br> over the front page! What?<br> - What'll we use for a headline?<br> - I don't care.<br> "War threatens Europe!"<br> - Which country?<br> - Flip a nickel!<br> Yes, sir.<br> The boss is here. He wants you right away.<br> Does he want me or my job?<br> Have you got a drink?<br> There's a fresh bottle on your desk.<br> I thought you'd need one.<br> I'll need it, and how.<br> I knew I'd find you<br> with a drink in your hand.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> What? Didn't Ching tell you?<br> Yes, Ching told me, and I told him,<br> and now I'm telling you.<br> I won't stand for it.<br> You can't do this to me, Warren Haggerty.<br> Not to me!<br> First it was a fire at sea.<br> Then it was a kidnapping.<br> - What's the gag this time?<br> - Darling, there's no gag.<br> - The newspaper's made a mistake.<br> - So has little Gladys.<br> Engaged to a newspaperman.<br> Joe Simpson never treated me like this.<br> - Then why did you divorce him?<br> - I've asked myself that many times.<br> Gladdie, after all, you got no kick.<br> I haven't?<br> First, you said a trip to Bermuda.<br> - You went to Bermuda.<br> - But alone. Then it was Europe.<br> If I wait another year,<br> it'll be Little America. I won't.<br> - I tell you, I can't get away.<br> - It's not Europe. It's the church.<br> It only takes 20 minutes to get married.<br> - But, Gladdie, the trip.<br> - I'll take Battery Park.<br> I'm going to take you<br> on the greatest trip a girl ever had...<br> just as soon as we settle the suit.<br> Nothing doing. For two years<br> I played second fiddle to this paper!<br> But the boss is waiting for me.<br> The preacher's waiting, too. Get your hat.<br> I can't go...<br> the paper's in a jam!<br> We're facing a libel suit!<br> You're facing a breach of promise suit!<br> If you don't want to marry me, say so!<br> Gladdie, you're getting yourself<br> all upset, darling.<br> - A little drinkie, maybe?<br> - Not today I don't.<br> Today, I get married!<br> - Well, l...<br> - Didn't they say I wanted to see you?<br> Say, what is this?<br> Do I own a paper or a lunatic asylum?<br> - You just took the words out of my mouth.<br> - Mr. Bane, my future wife.<br> Nonsense! I'll be in my office!<br> Get rid of this woman!<br> Take it easy, that's the owner of the paper.<br> I don't care who he is. Nobody talks<br> to me like a house detective.<br> How do you know<br> how a house detective talks?<br> Don't you think I read? Where are you...<br> No, you don't. If you think that you can...<br> Gladdie, darling.<br> Now, you tell the preacher to wait...<br> and I'll phone you just the minute I'm free,<br> and we'll get married today.<br> Now, that's a promise.<br> Tomorrow at this time,<br> you'll be a married woman.<br> I swear to it. Joe, come here.<br> Will you show Miss Benton to a taxi?<br> And this is supposed to be<br> the happiest day of a girl's life.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Why doesn't London answer?<br> I want J. B. Allenbury.<br> This is terrible, Haggerty.<br> - A mistake like that can ruin...<br> - What do the lawyers say?<br> An open-and-shut case. Pure libel<br> and slander. We haven't a leg to stand on.<br> And now, I've got to get on my knees<br> to Jim Allenbury...<br> a man I fought for 20 years,<br> never giving an inch.<br> They're ready with London, Mr. Bane.<br> Wait a minute. Let me talk to him.<br> You know how he hates you.<br> I'll take all the blame.<br> You know nothing,<br> not even that I'm phoning.<br> - Then if I fail...<br> - You mustn't.<br> Tell him it was just a mistake.<br> Maybe he doesn't know anything about it.<br> Only 50 of those papers got away.<br> Hello? Hello, London? Yeah, we're ready.<br> Hello? Hello, Mr. Allenbury?<br> This is Warren Haggerty<br> of the New York Evening Star.<br> You know the Star?<br> Well, I'm sorry you feel that way<br> about us, Mr. Allenbury.<br> Yes. I realize that we've<br> fought in the past...<br> but it's always been a good, clean fight.<br> No. Nothing serious.<br> But the early edition of the paper<br> carried a little item about your daughter.<br> Not that the item was serious at all,<br> but I just thought I'd phone you...<br> Yes. Yes, that's it, exactly.<br> The spirit of fair play.<br> I appreciate that spirit of fair play,<br> Mr. Haggerty...<br> but you see, my office cabled me<br> a copy of your little item.<br> What?<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Hardly what I'd call innocent...<br> but typical of Hollis Bane and everything<br> that his newspaper stands for.<br> No, I'm not interested, Mr. Haggerty.<br> You can discuss that with my attorney.<br> Now, hold on a minute.<br> This is Charles Archibald,<br> of Archibald, Davis, and Wingert.<br> We're filing suit immediately<br> through our New York office.<br> - You'll receive the papers tomorrow.<br> - Just a minute, Mr. Archibald.<br> Don't forget to mention<br> the amount we're suing for.<br> That should interest them.<br> By the way,<br> you might inform your Mr. Bane...<br> Miss Allenbury<br> is asking damages for $5 million.<br> $5 million.<br> She's insane, she's mad.<br> There never has been<br> a libel suit for $5 million.<br> There ain't that much money.<br> She's got all the money in the world now.<br> It's not money they're after.<br> It's the paper. It's me.<br> For 20 years, I've fought Allenbury.<br> Kept him out of the senate.<br> And when they wanted<br> to make him ambassador, I stopped it.<br> - $5 million.<br> - Their chance to strike back, and they are.<br> The paper will go.<br> Look what a lawsuit did<br> to New York Daily last year.<br> That's not going to happen to us.<br> We haven't begun to fight yet.<br> We've been sued before, big suits.<br> They were after money<br> and were glad to settle.<br> Allenbury will settle, too,<br> when we get through with her.<br> Remember the Farrell girl?<br> That was open-and-shut,<br> till we got busy on her.<br> You can't do that here.<br> There's never been a word of scandal<br> about Connie Allenbury.<br> Not yet, but she's human<br> and I'm gonna throw a man at her.<br> You're not suggesting a frame?<br> No. But we've got to get to this girl...<br> and I'm gonna bring in<br> the best man we ever had.<br> Who's that?<br> A guy that will beat<br> anybody in the world...<br> from Gandhi to Garbo. Bill Chandler.<br> Bill Chandler? Yes.<br> Now, you fired him,<br> the best man we ever had on libel.<br> - You admit it, and you fired him.<br> - Yes, and I'd do it again.<br> He was a vain, double-crossing heel.<br> Tried to run the paper.<br> - Thought he knew more about it than I did.<br> - And was right.<br> He's the only man<br> who can swing this case.<br> Get him!<br> I'll have him here in an hour.<br> Long distance.<br> New York calling Mr. Adams...<br> of The Chronicle at Washington, DC.<br> All right, put Haggerty on.<br> Hello, Haggerty. This is Adams of<br> The Washington Chronicle.<br> Chandler left here over a year ago,<br> headed for Denver.<br> Try The Courier.<br> Sure, I know him.<br> Chandler left Denver four months ago.<br> And the boss's wife<br> almost followed him to San Francisco.<br> That guy is dynamite.<br> He worked here, but he wasn't<br> with The Express two weeks...<br> when he quit and left San Francisco.<br> One of the girls here received<br> a Christmas card from Singapore.<br> Anyone in this great settlement knowing<br> the whereabouts of William Chandler...<br> will please communicate<br> with station ZHM, Singapore.<br> Keep the lines open. If anything comes in,<br> let me know. I'll be here.<br> He left Singapore three months ago.<br> How about Australia?<br> I can try Sydney.<br> He was always crazy about the races.<br> Okay, but rush it. Send another SOS<br> to the syndicated press...<br> and cable London and Berlin.<br> - Do anything, but find him.<br> - Maybe that guy's dead.<br> It would be just like him<br> to die at a time like this.<br> Hello.<br> In case you don't know it, it's 2:00<br> in the morning, and I've been asleep.<br> What do I do? Put the dress<br> in mothballs for another trip?<br> Change it for a straitjacket<br> and order one for me.<br> - You ought to get some sleep, boss.<br> - No. This coffee will fix me up all right.<br> I press suit up quick.<br> Maybe you try him again this afternoon.<br> - Throw him in the nearest ashcan.<br> - One trail leads to Sydney.<br> The other one to Shanghai.<br> Both report the whereabouts<br> of Bill Chandler unknown.<br> Call up that detective agency,<br> see if they can find him.<br> Chandler? You mean Mr. Chandler...<br> - the fellow who used to work here?<br> - Yes.<br> - I know where he is.<br> - What?<br> Sure, he's a good friend of mine.<br> Just last week,<br> he gave me $10 for my mother.<br> - She's been sick.<br> - What's his address?<br> He's at the Grand Plaza.<br> The Grand...<br> No, that can't be the Chandler we want.<br> Don't you mean Bill Chandler...<br> who was always giving you the raspberry?<br> Yeah! That's the fellow!<br> Tell the cable office we found him.<br> - Right under my nose!<br> - Shall I get him?<br> No, I want to talk to him personally,<br> feel him out a little.<br> So he's living at the Grand Plaza.<br> He must be in the money.<br> Warren Haggerty.<br> From Brooklyn to Bombay...<br> a stab in the back spells Haggerty.<br> I never stabbed you in the back,<br> Chandler, and I want...<br> After all, that was a long time ago,<br> and we should...<br> Bury the hatchet. Or was it a knife?<br> - Now get this, Chandler, I didn't knife you.<br> - You only tried to.<br> That was two years ago. We should...<br> - Let bygones be bygones.<br> - Why, sure. Whatever happened...<br> Is all over now. Goodbye.<br> It was nice to see you.<br> Good morning. Cigarettes, please.<br> Give my regards to the boys at the office.<br> You still at the Star?<br> Old man hasn't gotten wise to you yet.<br> Soon, you'll be out on your ear...<br> then the Star will be a first-class sheet.<br> Listen here, Chandler. If you're...<br> By the way, what are you<br> doing for yourself, Bill?<br> I just finished writing a book, Warren.<br> All about my early hardships,<br> the newspaper business...<br> and the rats I met running about.<br> - Lf you mention me in that book...<br> - Sue me for libel.<br> How is the libel these days?<br> You got a good man on the hush stuff?<br> Yeah, we get along.<br> Where did you go when you left us?<br> The intelligence department, Warren.<br> I always did like contrast. Cheerio.<br> - What's your hurry?<br> - Breakfast time.<br> - It can wait. I got an idea.<br> - I'll take breakfast.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Warren, you weren't like that when I left.<br> - This is a proposition.<br> - Not before breakfast.<br> - I haven't got time for breakfast.<br> - That's too bad. Goodbye.<br> - Good morning, captain.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Table for one.<br> - Table for two.<br> Very well, sir. This way, please.<br> - More coffee, sir?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Now, Warren, what's on your mind?<br> I've been thinking, Bill. After all,<br> you're a darn good newspaperman.<br> Maybe I was a little hasty when l...<br> You don't mean to give me back my job?<br> - That's it.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> You want to talk business?<br> All right, I'll talk.<br> You're in a jam over the Allenbury girl.<br> You printed a hot story<br> and she's suing you.<br> - Who told you?<br> - Elementary, my dear Watson.<br> I read the story. First edition only,<br> carried by no other paper.<br> That, says I,<br> is the fine Italian hand of Haggerty...<br> the bull in the china shop.<br> - What's she asking?<br> - $5 million.<br> Who does she think she is?<br> Just one of the richest girls in America.<br> Yes, I know all about her.<br> Title-crazy, with a fatheaded<br> old father to buy her in and out.<br> America's international playgirl.<br> That's her rep...<br> and she thinks it's worth $5 million.<br> When I get through with her,<br> she'll take five cents.<br> - Done. You're on the payroll.<br> - No, Warren. No philanthropy.<br> During the six months that I was on<br> the Star, I saved you, all told...<br> some $300,000. What did I get?<br> $125 a week.<br> That's the proposition, drawn yesterday.<br> I've been expecting you for 24 hours.<br> $5,000 down and $45,000 more<br> when you... Why, you're crazy.<br> No other reporter gets<br> that much money. It's robbery.<br> All right. Forget it.<br> You read any good books lately?<br> - Now, be reasonable, Bill.<br> - Take it or leave it. Wait a minute.<br> On second thought,<br> I don't want the job at any price.<br> I got all the money I need right now.<br> Look here.<br> I just got this from my publisher...<br> offering to advance me<br> $5,000 for a second book.<br> - Let's just forget about this.<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> You ought to be arrested for extortion.<br> You must have dropped this, sir.<br> - What is this?<br> - That is a letter.<br> I get it.<br> So your publisher is going to send you<br> a $5,000 advance?<br> $700 behind with the hotel, you mean.<br> - Not now, I'm not.<br> - I knew I was a sap to believe...<br> That's right, you were.<br> But you'll get your money's worth.<br> Now, here's the plan.<br> Allenburys are in London.<br> So I sail for England at once.<br> But they're coming back in 10 days.<br> That's why I'm sailing,<br> to come back with them.<br> Five days on a boat.<br> Anything can happen on a boat.<br> I meet the girl.<br> Perhaps she comes to my cabin...<br> - No. Not this girl.<br> - Only for a cocktail.<br> Perfectly innocent to her, me,<br> and everyone on the boat.<br> Except our private detective,<br> who radios my wife.<br> - You got a wife?<br> - No. This is a setup, not a confession.<br> But we hire some attractive girl<br> to marry me...<br> and when the time comes...<br> she stages a pretty little scene<br> over her erring husband...<br> and sues Connie for alienation of affection.<br> That's it, that's it.<br> The Star called Connie a husband-stealer.<br> She denies it.<br> We duplicate the situation.<br> This time, she does steal a husband.<br> This time, we're right.<br> Let her go to bat with a libel suit<br> and see what she collects.<br> But how about a girl to marry you?<br> Do you know anybody?<br> Now, that's tricky.<br> We've got to find someone we can trust.<br> I've got the girl, the very girl!<br> Hello.<br> What happened to you?<br> Do I want to get married?<br> What do you think?<br> I'll call the preacher right away.<br> The city hall?<br> Then I can't wear my wedding gown.<br> I won't ask any questions.<br> And don't keep me waiting.<br> Tiny? Tiny, come here.<br> I'm so happy. Today is my wedding day.<br> What, again, Miss Gladys?<br> You can't do this to me,<br> Warren Haggerty. Not to me!<br> Let me out of here.<br> For two years, you've had me<br> on a merry-go-round...<br> waiting for that gold ring,<br> but this is where I get off...<br> - and stay off!<br> - Be quiet.<br> I won't be quiet!<br> The things I've taken for that newspaper...<br> but this gets the blue ribbon,<br> trying to marry me off...<br> to that baboon!<br> Let's not deal in personality.<br> But, darling, it's only for a month,<br> maybe less.<br> Then six weeks in Reno.<br> And, Miss Benton, they've got<br> the loveliest place in Reno.<br> You'd love it.<br> You can play craps there every night.<br> That's right, that's right.<br> I'll come the moment you get divorced.<br> But I don't want a divorce.<br> I want to get married and stay married.<br> If you don't want to marry me, say so.<br> Of course I want to marry you,<br> but don't you understand, Gladys?<br> This comes first. It's our only chance.<br> I'll get fired.<br> There isn't a newspaper in the world...<br> that would hire me as an office boy.<br> Would they, Bill?<br> - Not if they know you like I do.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You remember poor Ed Glover?<br> You remember after he lost that libel suit?<br> They found his car gone over a cliff<br> and a revolver in his hand.<br> - Do you want me to kill myself?<br> - Did you change your insurance?<br> Would I ask you to do this thing for me...<br> if I didn't consider you<br> practically my wife?<br> Would you ask your wife<br> to hook up with that ape?<br> The ape objects.<br> Darling, you're not marrying him, really.<br> A wedding ceremony,<br> six hours in a hotel apartment...<br> during which time I'll never leave you,<br> and then he leaves for Europe.<br> - Don't talk to me. I'm leaving.<br> - Wait a minute. I'm leaving. The deal is off.<br> Here's your contract. $50,000.<br> - I wouldn't hook up with her for $1 million.<br> - Now, Bill, you know the spot I'm in.<br> That's your tough luck.<br> You'll have to get a new boy.<br> - You mean you're walking out on him?<br> - That's it, sister.<br> You know what the Star means to him...<br> you're a newspaperman. You know.<br> It'll ruin his life. It'll ruin his career.<br> A fine friend you are.<br> - Lf you put it that way.<br> - I'm putting it that way.<br> - Good. I'll get the guy.<br> - The things I do for that newspaper.<br> "And I pronounce you man and wife."<br> Aren't you going to kiss the bride?<br> Yes! Sure.<br> May I?<br> Why not?<br> Everybody else seems to be doing it.<br> Aren't you going to kiss me?<br> Sure, sure.<br> An old friend of the family.<br> Yes.<br> Darling.<br> Very old friend.<br> I hope you'll be very happy...<br> and don't forget to invite me<br> to your silver anniversary.<br> It'll have to be within the next six weeks.<br> Goodbye, and good luck.<br> Goodbye. Good luck to you.<br> - Take his arm.<br> - I'm taking your arm.<br> Yes.<br> Send it up, and send a waiter, please.<br> Right away? Thanks.<br> That's the wire you sent me.<br> There will be a bellboy and a waiter<br> to witness the very tender scene...<br> when we learn that I'm called to Europe.<br> Now, remember, won't you?<br> You're all broken up.<br> He is torn from your arms,<br> the bridegroom of an hour.<br> - That's too long for me.<br> - To my little bride.<br> I hope you choke on it.<br> - Darling.<br> - Don't call me that.<br> You know what my name is.<br> - Of course, Mrs. William Chandler.<br> - I'd just as soon have a number.<br> - Come on, now. You mustn't fight.<br> - Why not? We're married.<br> You're supposed to be happily married.<br> You're supposed to be in love<br> with each other.<br> I must have been crazy to let you<br> marry me off to another guy.<br> But let me tell you this, Warren Haggerty.<br> From now on, you've got<br> to forget the paper and take me places.<br> I can't take you places,<br> you've got to stay in the apartment.<br> You can sew, sleep, and play the radio.<br> - Maybe you could learn to read.<br> - You're not going to take me out?<br> Honey, I can't take you out.<br> You can't be seen running around<br> with another man.<br> You're supposed to be married.<br> You've got to look married.<br> Maybe twins would help.<br> Now, remember, remember.<br> - Yes?<br> - Telegram for Mr. Chandler.<br> - Just wait. Clear the table, please.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Bill, there's a telegram for you.<br> Thanks, sweetness.<br> Would you open it for me, honeykins?<br> Bill.<br> - What is it?<br> - Read it.<br> - What does it say?<br> - It's from the office.<br> "Lmperative you sail Queen Anne tonight<br> for director's meeting in London.<br> "Reservations arranged.<br> Anderson will meet you. Bon voyage."<br> You can't leave me.<br> Bill, you mustn't leave me!<br> Baby, this is terrible,<br> breaking into our honeymoon like this.<br> But what am I to do, honey? I'll have to go.<br> You can't.<br> It's only for a couple of weeks,<br> Mrs. Chandler.<br> But a couple of weeks<br> are a couple of weeks!<br> - I'll miss my little Billikins.<br> - And I'll miss my little fuzzy-face.<br> I'm afraid you'll have to hurry<br> if you're gonna make that boat.<br> Yes, that's right. Here, boy.<br> Just take my grips here.<br> These leather ones are mine.<br> Sure was a lucky thing<br> that I didn't unpack.<br> Waiter, thank you very much.<br> Darling, I'll miss you every minute.<br> Every second!<br> Hold it. They've gone.<br> Save it for the elevator.<br> - Well, for the...<br> - Here comes the elevator.<br> The bride and groom.<br> Darling, I'll miss you every minute.<br> Every second.<br> Goodbye, old man.<br> He's gone.<br> The maid.<br> Why, he'll come back, Mrs. Chandler.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Chandler?<br> - Hello.<br> - Sailing back with us so soon, sir?<br> - I only came to London for three days.<br> - Lf there's anything I can do, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Everything is set.<br> Palmer's gonna take the smack.<br> Fine. Tell the boys to lay it on heavy.<br> Here they come. Beat it.<br> I'll see you on the boat.<br> Boys. Here they come now.<br> Chandler says lay it on heavy.<br> Mr. Allenbury, excuse me, sir.<br> There's been a bit of a mix-up<br> on your baggage.<br> - Come with me.<br> - Shall I attend to it?<br> I'd better go with you, Graham.<br> Wait here, Connie.<br> Will you make a statement for the press?<br> Are you suing for L1 million?<br> - What are your chances of winning?<br> - I've nothing to say.<br> Miss Allenbury, you must be able to<br> tell us something.<br> - No, nothing.<br> - Surely, you'll make a statement.<br> Will you please let me go?<br> - You can't afford to ignore the press.<br> - Can't I?<br> Turn her around, Palmer.<br> Take your hands off of me!<br> Watch the dicky bird, ducky.<br> Just a minute.<br> Obviously, the young lady<br> doesn't wish to be photographed.<br> That's none of your affair.<br> Now, clear out, all of you!<br> Hello.<br> Connie, are you all right?<br> Yes, dear, I'm all right.<br> This is an outrage.<br> You men ought to be arrested.<br> We'll fix him.<br> That was William Chandler, the author.<br> - Remember that name, Graham.<br> - Yes, sir. William Chandler.<br> I ought to have charged that blighter<br> L10 instead of L5.<br> Come in.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Mr. Allenbury's compliments.<br> Will Mr. Chandler join him<br> for cocktails before dinner?<br> - Mr. Allenbury?<br> - Mr. J.B. Allenbury.<br> The lady you rescued from those reporters<br> today is Mr. Allenbury's daughter.<br> Yes. I'll be delighted to have cocktails<br> with Mr. Allenbury.<br> - 7:30, the Grill Room bar.<br> - 7:30. Thank you.<br> - You rang, sir?<br> - Yes. Steward...<br> do you know if they have any<br> books in the ship's library on angling?<br> - Angling, sir?<br> - Yes. You know, trout fishing?<br> Yes. We have several.<br> Shall I fetch you one, sir?<br> Yes, just bring me all of them.<br> - All of them, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> The best rainbow-trout fishing<br> is found in Lake...<br> Taupo. Lake Taupo, New Zealand.<br> The best rainbow-trout fishing<br> is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand.<br> Lake Taupo.<br> The best rainbow-trout fishing<br> is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand.<br> Now, the best rainbow-trout fishing<br> is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand.<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Allenbury has been delayed<br> by a ship phone call from America...<br> - but he asked that you order. Do sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> We appreciated what you did<br> this morning. Most unfortunate.<br> - Here's Mr. Allenbury.<br> - Sorry to be late, Mr...<br> - Chandler.<br> - Chandler. Have you ordered?<br> - A dry martini, please.<br> - The same.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me.<br> - Did we hear from the bank?<br> - Complete accounting.<br> And Jennings, shall he meet you<br> in Washington?<br> No, he'd better come to New York<br> and fly down with me.<br> That's the only time that I'll have.<br> Be sure that the plane is ready.<br> - It's ordered for noon.<br> - Good.<br> Now, young man, I want to thank you...<br> for what you did this morning,<br> both for my daughter and myself.<br> - Quick thought on your part.<br> - I rather enjoyed it.<br> As a matter of fact, newspapers and I<br> are not very good friends.<br> One time in Chicago,<br> I sent a reporter to a hospital.<br> - My publishers never forgave me.<br> - Publishers?<br> Yes. I'm a writer.<br> Indeed?<br> Just now, I'm doing some fishing yarns.<br> Really?<br> Yes.<br> Well, Father?<br> Connie, my dear, I wasn't...<br> - I want you to meet Mr...<br> - Chandler.<br> Mr. Chandler.<br> The man who saved your life.<br> Yes, indeed. Thank you so much.<br> I thought you were with<br> those people from Plymouth.<br> I ran out on them. I simply can't be<br> bothered with people you meet on boats.<br> I'm glad that we met on the dock.<br> - A mint frapp.<br> - Yes, miss.<br> I should apologize for the scene I caused.<br> Waiter, never mind. I won't have any.<br> Mr. Charmers...<br> - Chandler.<br> - Mr. Chandler is a writer.<br> How amusing. What do you write?<br> Father, guess who's with us.<br> Mrs. Burns-Norvell,<br> and that dreadful daughter of hers.<br> We elude them in Europe,<br> and now we meet them on the same boat.<br> Now we're in for it.<br> They'll be asking us to dinner.<br> Not if we see them first.<br> I've been ducking them all day.<br> Are you having fun, Mr...<br> My plane. Father, did you<br> cable about my plane?<br> - Leave it in storage. I've chartered one.<br> - But I want my own.<br> I'm dying to feel the stick<br> in my hands again.<br> Do you fly, Mr. Charmers?<br> Chandler. Oh, yes, I've...<br> I've flown across with Lindbergh<br> a couple of times.<br> But my favorite sport is fishing.<br> Sorry, Mr. Allenbury, it's 7:30.<br> Thank you for joining us.<br> If ever we need your help again,<br> I hope you'll be on hand.<br> It's been so nice to see you.<br> Good evening.<br> Here they are, Mother.<br> Connie! Connie, my dear!<br> We've been looking for you<br> all over the boat.<br> My dears! It's so nice<br> to see you both again.<br> Bert will be so pleased<br> that we're crossing together.<br> - How are you, Mrs. Burns-Norvell?<br> - And you're joining us for dinner.<br> I won't take no.<br> It's my birthday, I'll be 21 at midnight.<br> - I'm very sorry.<br> - No, no excuses.<br> We'd love to, but you see, Connie...<br> I'm sorry if I'm late, J.B.,<br> but I had to send a very important wire.<br> Shall we go in to dinner now?<br> - Yes.<br> - We're dining with Mr. Charmers.<br> Mrs. Burns-Norvell<br> and her daughter, Barbara.<br> How do you do?<br> Can't we all have dinner together?<br> - They're going to talk business.<br> - Yes.<br> You see, I'm a writer...<br> and Mr. Allenbury and I<br> are doing a book together.<br> But too wonderful!<br> You must tell me all about it tomorrow.<br> - I'm always up for lunch.<br> - Yes.<br> Well, we're indebted to you again. Thanks.<br> That was fast thinking.<br> I suppose we'll have to have<br> dinner together now. Shall we?<br> Three, sir?<br> Father, you're in luck.<br> Your favorite fish, brook trout.<br> Do you care for trout?<br> Do I care for trout?<br> The one thing in the world<br> that I care for is trout...<br> in any shape or form.<br> Especially on the end of a line.<br> You're an angler?<br> I'm on my way now to Glen Arden...<br> all set to prove they'll rise<br> to a Parmacheene Belle.<br> No, not this early.<br> A Royal Coachman, perhaps.<br> Or maybe a Pink Lady by visible,<br> but not a Parmacheene Belle.<br> - I've caught them.<br> - Not at Glen Arden.<br> I know. I've fished Glen Arden. I've tried it.<br> Father...<br> shall we say trout?<br> What a sport.<br> To feel the trout on your line...<br> to play him, to reel him in.<br> - There's no thrill in the world like it.<br> - Just one that beats it.<br> When you first see him.<br> Not yet on your hook,<br> but rising to the bait.<br> I stand corrected.<br> I remember once, in the high Sierras,<br> I was using a Wickham's Fancy.<br> - No, a grizzly wing.<br> - Father...<br> for two hours we've had nothing but fish.<br> My dear, I was only telling him<br> about my trip to the Sierras.<br> Perhaps you'd like to dance? Shall we?<br> - Did you ever fish the Rockies?<br> - Have I?<br> Fisher Falls. Gluckman's Point.<br> Gluckman's Point?<br> I'm afraid that dancing<br> isn't exactly my line.<br> I should say it was part of your line.<br> - May I be frank, too?<br> - Why not?<br> You dance superbly.<br> I was hoping for something original.<br> Dear, life is so full of disappointments.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Just the lurch of the boat.<br> Afraid I wasn't concentrating.<br> It was your eyes.<br> Beautiful, aren't they?<br> They remind me...<br> Yes, I know.<br> Sparkling diamonds, deep sapphires.<br> No, they remind me of angry marbles.<br> Connie, darling! You must have<br> luncheon with us tomorrow, promise?<br> I've a bone to pick with you.<br> I'm afraid l...<br> I'm sorry, but we can't work<br> on our book without Connie.<br> She's our inspiration.<br> I thought that was rather clever.<br> Yes. I thought you thought so.<br> Don't I get a vote of thanks?<br> Oh, by all means.<br> It just dawned on me<br> that I seem to have made myself...<br> a permanent member of your party.<br> Yes. It's dawned on me, too.<br> Shall we sit down?<br> So, you've fished Gluckman's Point?<br> You're an angler, all right.<br> I should say Mr. Chandler<br> is quite an angler.<br> Will you both excuse me? I'm quite tired.<br> - See you tomorrow.<br> - I think not.<br> I'm going to read books<br> the rest of the trip.<br> - You're not ill, my dear?<br> - Oh, no.<br> That'll give you a chance<br> to talk fish till New York.<br> I could talk fish from here to Shanghai.<br> Couldn't you, Mr. Chandler?<br> Yes, yes, and back again.<br> - Good night, Dad.<br> - Good night, dear.<br> Good night, Mr. Chandler.<br> Don't keep father up<br> too late with your fish stories.<br> Gluckman's Point?<br> Glasses?<br> How do I look?<br> Nobody in the world will know you.<br> Fine. That's the idea.<br> Catching up on your reading?<br> Remember me?<br> Oh, yes. I just left Father.<br> He's enjoyed his three-day fish fest.<br> So have I.<br> - He's waiting for you.<br> - He won't mind waiting.<br> You don't know Father.<br> You know the man. I know the angler.<br> It's nice you have so much in common.<br> I won't detain you.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Chandler.<br> Goodbye.<br> You've got to help me.<br> I'm in a bit of a jam<br> with the Burns-Norvells.<br> I've been trying to duck them,<br> but they finally caught me.<br> Cocktails and dinner tonight.<br> How nice. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br> Wait a minute, now.<br> It's your turn to come through for me.<br> After all, I inherited them from you.<br> I'm going to tell them<br> that you and your father...<br> will also join me for cocktails<br> before dinner.<br> Mr. Chandler, you think of<br> the sweetest things.<br> Now when the Burns-Norvells arrive...<br> - you come in without your father.<br> - Father gets all the breaks.<br> And announce that he wants<br> to see me right away.<br> A brilliant idea for our book...<br> and that we'll have to work<br> the whole evening.<br> See, could you do that?<br> Good, then cocktails<br> in my stateroom at 7:00.<br> - In your stateroom?<br> - Yes.<br> You see, the bar is<br> too near the dining room.<br> Oh, I see.<br> - Your stateroom at 7:00?<br> - That's right.<br> - Splendid.<br> - All right. Until then.<br> with me in my stateroom.<br> Give us about 10 minutes.<br> Swell. How did you manage it?<br> She thinks I've invited<br> a lot of other people.<br> How do you do? Are we late?<br> Late?<br> So sweet of you to send<br> a message by Connie...<br> asking us to have cocktails with you.<br> She asked you to...<br> She said that you were<br> too bashful to ask us yourself.<br> Where is Miss Connie now?<br> - We needn't worry about Connie.<br> - We forgot to tell you.<br> Connie isn't coming.<br> She has another headache.<br> Mr. Chandler? Where are you?<br> - Hello.<br> - The inevitable Mr. Chandler.<br> - How was the cocktail party?<br> - Delightful.<br> So sorry I couldn't come.<br> I trust the Burns-Norvells consoled you.<br> I found them very charming.<br> Far superior to many people<br> one meets on boats.<br> Yes. Babs is one girl in a million.<br> And so rich, too.<br> - Or didn't you know that?<br> - At least she has good breeding.<br> Then...<br> - Everything went off all right?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> In fact, I'm glad now that you didn't come.<br> You are?<br> Why this change of heart?<br> You're so fragile.<br> - Fragile.<br> - Yes, you damage so easily.<br> - Damage?<br> - Sues for $5 million.<br> That fascinates me.<br> Asks $5 million damages.<br> - So the Burns-Norvells told you.<br> - It gave me a new light on you.<br> Who is this marvel, I said,<br> Florence Nightingale? Jeanne d'Arc?<br> What has she done to earn<br> such a precious reputation?<br> - Found a cure for death and taxes?<br> - Aren't you being a little absurd?<br> - Aren't you?<br> - Wait a minute, you don't understand...<br> Do be careful. It might break.<br> I'm not accustomed to handling<br> anything so delicate, so valuable.<br> That should be touched only by royalty,<br> dukes or earls.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> you should be kept under glass.<br> And that is the last I saw of Miss Connie<br> until we reached New York.<br> Five days on a boat,<br> and she slaps your face.<br> - That's fine progress.<br> - So the wonder boy lays an egg.<br> - Would you hush your girlfriend?<br> - Say, listen, nobody's hushing me.<br> I've got my ticket to Reno,<br> my reservations at the hotel...<br> - and even my lawyer.<br> - Postponed only.<br> A million-to-1 we'll never see them again.<br> You lose. He's already invited me<br> for a weekend of fishing.<br> Just you and the father?<br> What do I do, bust in on you<br> and the old man?<br> Connie will be there.<br> I'll take bets on that, too.<br> That wasn't any farewell slap.<br> - When?<br> - We're driving up tomorrow.<br> Perfect. Alone in the mountains,<br> away from the world.<br> The next night, Gladys and I...<br> No. I'd better stay away.<br> - Just Gladys.<br> - What, alone?<br> And a detective.<br> Connie rushes from her room.<br> You come from yours, follow her down.<br> - What'll I wear?<br> - Flashlights! The case is in the bag.<br> Nice work. I knew you'd deliver.<br> I think I'll wear the pink.<br> I look awful cute in pink.<br> - There's only one hitch.<br> - Hitch?<br> - Fish.<br> - Fish?<br> I've told him fish stories<br> that would curl your hair...<br> and I've never even had a rod in my hand.<br> - I'll have an instructor here in the morning.<br> - In the morning?<br> Him? Here? Where am I supposed to be?<br> Now, it'll be all right, Gladys.<br> - You're gonna leave me here alone?<br> - I'm here.<br> It'll be all right.<br> It's just a business arrangement.<br> It's mighty funny business, if you ask me.<br> Where are you going?<br> To get some bedclothes.<br> I'm sleeping out here.<br> You see, it'll be all right.<br> Bill out here and you in there.<br> Do you mean to tell me<br> that you're willing for me, your fiance...<br> - the girl that you love...<br> - Please.<br> I've done plenty for you and the Star...<br> but there's a time to draw a line,<br> and I'm drawing it.<br> I trust Bill like he was a brother.<br> Yeah, but he isn't my brother.<br> He can't even speak politely.<br> - He insults me with every breath he takes.<br> - Pipe down. You'll hurt his feelings.<br> Bill, I'll have that fisherman here<br> the first thing in the morning.<br> The first false move, I'll leave.<br> Unless I'm cuckoo,<br> I'll be out before midnight.<br> It'll be all right, darling.<br> Good night, Bill, good night.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> - Good night, old man.<br> Hello?<br> Flowers?<br> On the way up?<br> Oh, yes. Thanks.<br> Open the door, will you?<br> There are some flowers on the way up.<br> We gotta get these bedclothes out of here.<br> Hurry up!<br> I've lost the keys.<br> Good morning.<br> Where did you get that key?<br> The front-door key always fits both doors.<br> - You mean that key was there all night?<br> - Naturally.<br> - For Mrs. Chandler.<br> - Of course, just wait a minute.<br> For me, Billikins?<br> Yes, my little fuzzy-wuzzy.<br> They're lovely. Thank you, sugar pie.<br> How did you know white roses<br> were my favorite flowers?<br> What?<br> Haggerty sent those.<br> Haggerty never sent me flowers before.<br> No? It's all part of the plan.<br> I'm gonna get some breakfast.<br> I thought the plan was to stay here<br> and look married.<br> - Lf you don't mind.<br> - I don't mind if you don't mind.<br> I don't mind if you... Who started this?<br> What do you want for breakfast?<br> Breakfast. You know, fruit...<br> Will you have some more coffee, Bill?<br> No.<br> This certainly looks married,<br> a little too married to suit me.<br> I'm sorry. Here, have a piece.<br> - Try the funnies.<br> - No, I wanna talk.<br> You do?<br> Well, all right, let's talk.<br> - Who goes first?<br> - I'll start.<br> You are a strange egg.<br> - I bet you say that to all the boys.<br> - I'll get it.<br> - Good morning. Mrs. Chandler?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm Evans from<br> the Angler Supply Company.<br> - I've bought some supplies.<br> - Bring them right in.<br> And this is Mr. Chandler.<br> Good morning, Mr. Evans.<br> I've brought everything, a complete outfit.<br> You'll have no trouble learning<br> to fish with this equipment.<br> No, sir. The elbow low and close.<br> Muscle has nothing to do with it.<br> It's the natural spring of the rod, sir.<br> Too bad I'm not fishing for curtains.<br> I'd be sensational.<br> Now suppose you break your leg,<br> then you can stay home.<br> That's what I call constructive.<br> I was just trying to help.<br> Now, a little patience, sir.<br> Try again. And remember...<br> - the elbow low and close.<br> - Low and close.<br> Bull's eye! Give the gentleman a cigar.<br> I don't quite seem to get it.<br> It's your wrist, sir. Keep it easy and fluid...<br> like rippling water. This way, sir.<br> Darling, don't you want<br> to powder your nose or something?<br> And miss this?<br> Not for the world, sweetheart.<br> Pretend there's a 5-pound beauty<br> in yonder pool...<br> just behind the jutting boulder.<br> Mrs. Chandler, would you mind stepping<br> down here to the corner of the table...<br> - and bending over?<br> - Now I'm a jutting boulder.<br> I'll be a tall, spreading<br> tree just behind you.<br> Don't forget the wrist.<br> Remember, there's a man on second.<br> I know I'm never gonna get this.<br> I was never cut out to be an angler.<br> Look, this is the way I would do it.<br> - You did it, sir.<br> - I'll say he did it. And how.<br> That cast, sir. Why, not one angler in 50...<br> can master the underhand stroke.<br> - Underhand is right.<br> - You mean it's all right?<br> It's perfect, sir. Could you do it again?<br> - Not with this boulder, he can't.<br> - Like a backhand at tennis.<br> - Perfect, sir.<br> - Yeah?<br> This is what makes life worth living.<br> A breath of this early morning air<br> is worth all the medicine in the world.<br> Certainly is.<br> We're not keeping you up, are we?<br> Me? No. I'm always up<br> at the crack of dawn.<br> Here we are, Chandler. My favorite spot.<br> How do you like it?<br> Fine, splendid.<br> Very much like the Lake Taupo country,<br> New Zealand.<br> Go ahead, we'll give you the first cast.<br> Yes.<br> I tell you. I think I'll go on up the way...<br> where the ripples are faster<br> and the brush is sparser.<br> This is going to be good.<br> I still bet he can't fish.<br> Nonsense. He's the best-informed man<br> on angling I've ever met.<br> - Father, darling, you're a sucker.<br> - Now listen to me, young lady.<br> I know a first-class angler when I see one.<br> Yes, and a first-class man, too.<br> - Lf he's first-class, I'll travel steerage.<br> - What did you come up here for?<br> You had a weekend all planned in town.<br> I didn't want to see my favorite father<br> tossed to a wolf.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I'm talking about that.<br> He's after something, and it isn't fish.<br> Look at those new togs.<br> A new rod.<br> Watch this.<br> Great guns!<br> I take it all back. He's good.<br> Good? He's magnificent.<br> I wish I could master that underhand cast.<br> I've got one.<br> A beauty.<br> So have I. I've got his brother.<br> Another one!<br> Not having much luck, are you,<br> Mr. Chandler?<br> I'm surprised you're not catching<br> any fish, Mr. Chandler.<br> It won't be long now.<br> I wonder if Mr. Chandler's having any luck.<br> Don't worry about him.<br> He's a real outdoor man.<br> Dad, look!<br> Walleye! He's hooked Walleye!<br> But he'll never land him.<br> He'll never land him.<br> Reel him. No.<br> Let him play. Give him some line.<br> Reel him out. Reel him.<br> Here, hold his head up.<br> Don't net him.<br> Don't net him. You did!<br> Boy, what a beauty.<br> - How'd you do it?<br> - I just followed the book. The hook.<br> Walleye. You've got Walleye.<br> - Who?<br> - Walleye.<br> The biggest, most elusive trout<br> in Glen Arden.<br> We've been fishing him for two years<br> and you got him.<br> - It was nothing.<br> - Nothing, you say?<br> But I'm ashamed of you, spoiling his sport<br> with a net.<br> Nine-tenths of the fun is reeling him in.<br> I know. I'm sorry. I was so excited.<br> Unhook him.<br> - What?<br> - Yes.<br> - Unhook him.<br> - Yes.<br> That is, no!<br> You invited me up here,<br> so you should have some of the glory.<br> - So you unhook him.<br> - I don't like to spoil your fun.<br> No. That's quite the contrary.<br> There's plenty of glory to go all around.<br> It's mighty sporting of you<br> to let me do this.<br> Not at all.<br> I think a toast is in order,<br> if you don't mind.<br> Hear, hear. To Walleye, king of trout.<br> How have the mighty fallen.<br> Undone by a Parmacheene Belle...<br> and I thought his weakness<br> was a Pink Lady.<br> Another batch coming up.<br> Say, you certainly have a way<br> with the griddle!<br> - She's a remarkable girl.<br> - I'm beginning to think you're right.<br> - I resent the understatement.<br> - Just a spoiled brat.<br> - Service.<br> - Yes, sir. Coming up.<br> Bulls eye!<br> Never miss. Queen of the flapjacks.<br> - Father?<br> - I must think of my figure.<br> A 20-minute walk, if you can spare me,<br> then eight hours of sleep.<br> - But we need help, Father.<br> - No more for me.<br> Where's my pipe? Alex?<br> Lmagine, you and a flapjack.<br> How'd you ever get together?<br> And they laughed at me<br> when I sat down on the griddle.<br> I still think it's a trick.<br> Nothing in my hands.<br> Nothing up my sleeves.<br> I know. It's all done with mirrors.<br> Young man, there are many sides<br> to my nature.<br> Depths you'd never dream of.<br> - I'll make a study.<br> - Do.<br> - How'd you like a swim in the moonlight?<br> - Swim?<br> Later on. You do swim?<br> Yes. Almost as well as I dance.<br> Then you'll drown.<br> - Isn't it awfully cold?<br> - Extremely. Do you mind?<br> What, me mind? My intimates call me<br> "Polar Bear" Chandler.<br> We're only 20 miles from the place.<br> We'll be there in 45 minutes.<br> But I'm not supposed to show up<br> until midnight.<br> What's the difference? You'll bust in<br> on them a half an hour earlier, that's all.<br> You'll find cigarettes over there<br> under the lamp.<br> Thanks.<br> - Say, you're pretty palatial up here.<br> - Like it?<br> - I think it's grand.<br> - I always come down for a plunge.<br> I've even stayed here all night. No, thanks.<br> - What? Here, alone?<br> - Yes, there's nothing to be afraid of.<br> Pretty neat.<br> I like music with my moonlight.<br> You know, you're a funny kid.<br> That's what you seem like up here, a kid.<br> Very different from<br> the girl I met on the boat.<br> I feel different.<br> This place, it's all tied up<br> with my childhood.<br> The trees, the air, the water.<br> Even the frogs.<br> I'm mad about frogs.<br> I love it. We've always<br> had heavenly times up here.<br> Every minute completely filled, like today.<br> - Yes. It's been perfect.<br> - It has, hasn't it?<br> Almost too perfect.<br> And it's costing me a fortune, young man.<br> What?<br> I'm paying dearly for this day of fun.<br> Meaning?<br> It's my own fault<br> for daring to bet with Dad on men.<br> I'm a rotten judge of men.<br> Well, aren't we all?<br> I bet him a new plane that you'd<br> tip your hand in the first 24 hours.<br> It's rather sporting of your father<br> to back a dark horse.<br> Dad's a grand judge of character.<br> He placed you right away.<br> Impetuous, friendly,<br> enthusiastic, guileless.<br> Guileless?<br> Not so sure about that.<br> What's your analysis?<br> Well, I said it first on the boat.<br> Just another fortune hunter<br> chasing $50 million on the hoof.<br> Then?<br> And then you told me off<br> for being fragile...<br> but I still said, he's got something<br> up his sleeve he wants to sell.<br> An oil well, an invention,<br> or an emerald mine.<br> The last young man we took on<br> had an emerald mine.<br> And will you believe it,<br> I even bet you didn't fish?<br> And you lost.<br> "Live and learn, Connie, my angel," I said.<br> "Next time, don't bet on men."<br> What are you thinking?<br> I haven't hurt you, have I?<br> I didn't mean to hurt you.<br> It was just my way of saying<br> I hope we can be friends.<br> That's about the nicest thing<br> that's been said to me this lifetime.<br> - Friends?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Then you do forgive me?<br> Don't apologize for suspecting people,<br> Connie. Keep right on.<br> Ring every coin you meet.<br> There are lots of wooden nickels<br> in circulation.<br> Come on.<br> No, I want to talk.<br> You're the first person in years.<br> You're in for it, my lad.<br> The story of my life.<br> The kitten who died when I was six,<br> and my great-aunt Matilde...<br> and all those twisted newspaper stories<br> you read about my romances...<br> and why they weren't romances.<br> There aren't going to be any more<br> twisted stories.<br> What do you think a paper<br> could make of this?<br> And couldn't they just?<br> You, me, here alone on a raft?<br> Single note of the chime<br> indicates exactly 11:00.<br> And who are you, Cinderella's brother?<br> - What happens at the stroke of 12:00?<br> - You'll never know. I hope.<br> - Come on, I'll race you.<br> - All right.<br> Connie Allenbury, you've taken from me<br> the one thing in the world I love...<br> my husband.<br> - How is that?<br> - Great.<br> - Next week, East Lynne.<br> - You just don't appreciate art.<br> - Look, what's that?<br> - What?<br> It's a holdup.<br> - Chandler.<br> - What the...<br> Why, Bill.<br> I had to stop you before<br> you got to the lodge.<br> - She's gone.<br> - What?<br> You mean we aren't<br> gonna finish it tonight?<br> She only came to put the place in order...<br> - then she went right back to town.<br> - Why didn't you call?<br> They don't have telephones<br> in trout streams.<br> I'd better go.<br> Somebody might see you here.<br> Aren't you going with us? Move over.<br> I can't disappear<br> in the middle of the night.<br> What a lady-killer you are. One look<br> at you and the gal disappears.<br> Say, don't worry.<br> Rome wasn't built in a day.<br> It didn't cost $5 million, either.<br> We had a nice, long ride.<br> What are you talking about?<br> We can't miss.<br> - The setup is perfect.<br> - The setup is crazy. We haven't a chance.<br> At the end of the 10th round, it's a draw.<br> The girl was there in the mountains?<br> - But only for one night.<br> - One night is enough.<br> You told your wife you'd been<br> called to Washington, remember?<br> Yes, like it was yesterday.<br> Yeah, but you lied.<br> You didn't go to Washington.<br> You went to Allenbury Lodge<br> for a rendezvous with Connie.<br> Our private detective<br> will swear he followed you.<br> - But her father was there.<br> - That was a blind.<br> - She left the following morning.<br> - Sure. A guilty conscience.<br> - You're insane.<br> - What a mind.<br> Now I know where you get those<br> stories about working nights.<br> Then you come home,<br> you're indifferent to your wife.<br> You fight with her.<br> It's as neat a case<br> for alienation of affection...<br> as I've ever seen,<br> and we slap it on tomorrow!<br> - No, we don't.<br> - Why don't we?<br> Because you can't get away with it.<br> They'd throw that case out of<br> any court in the world. You, too.<br> Not if I wear blue.<br> I'm awfully appealing in blue.<br> A: I was Allenbury's guest, not Connie's.<br> B: I was never alone with her. C...<br> - I know the alphabet.<br> - But you haven't got a leg to stand on.<br> Take it easy, will you?<br> I'm getting a real in with the family...<br> and I'm developing an open-and-shut case.<br> We're gonna file suit tomorrow.<br> Be at Britton & Britton's office at 9:00,<br> and I can catch that noon edition.<br> You'd make your crippled grandmother<br> do a fan dance for that paper.<br> Now, Gladdie.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Give me one week and I guarantee<br> to put her in a real spot.<br> Not a chance. She's walked out<br> on you twice already.<br> You know, Bill, I'm beginning to think<br> you've lost your touch.<br> - Goodbye, Gladdie. Don't be late.<br> - Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?<br> Well.<br> That's Warren for you.<br> Crazy about me,<br> but boy, how he conceals it.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - I just can't make him out.<br> I can understand<br> he's tossing me to the dogs for the paper.<br> - But to do it to the girl he loves...<br> - Who's tossing whom to what dogs?<br> If he goes through with this<br> in the morning...<br> by tomorrow night, we'll all be in jail.<br> - Jail?<br> - Jail.<br> I don't get you.<br> It's the plan we've had right along.<br> Yeah, but we haven't enough evidence<br> to convince a backward child.<br> If we spring this, the Allenburys are bound<br> to smell a frame-up!<br> - Do you really think so?<br> - I'm sure of it.<br> But to think that he'd do this to you.<br> A beautiful girl who loves him,<br> who's doing everything in the world...<br> Believe me, kid. You've put up with a lot.<br> You know, you're one girl in a million.<br> You don't know the tenth of it.<br> You wouldn't believe what I've stood for.<br> I know.<br> The night I met him,<br> he stood me up for two hours.<br> For what? A woman in Jersey<br> had quadruplets...<br> and it's been that way ever since.<br> I know. It's tough.<br> Fine, sensitive girl like you.<br> That's love for you.<br> - The things I could tell you...<br> - I'd like to hear all about them.<br> - Let's have a bite to eat.<br> - All right.<br> - You dance divinely.<br> - Thanks.<br> There have been complaints.<br> Then you must have been out<br> with amateurs.<br> I hope Warren won't mind<br> our dancing like this.<br> What? Him.<br> After all, it's perfectly innocent. Just fun.<br> Sure. Certainly a girl can dance<br> with her own husband...<br> - and you are my husband.<br> - Yes, quite.<br> Besides, this is our last night.<br> What do you mean?<br> If you're going to file suit tomorrow...<br> I'll have to move out of here<br> to prove that we're alienated.<br> - You know, I'm gonna miss you.<br> - I'll miss you, too.<br> - You're a swell kid, Gladys.<br> - You're not such a cluck yourself.<br> I hate to see you get mixed up<br> in that mess tomorrow.<br> Look, you don't want me to file that suit,<br> do you?<br> No, I don't. For your own sake.<br> Then I don't. I don't start anything<br> until you tell me to.<br> It'll mean a row with Warren.<br> It won't be the first one.<br> Let's dance some more.<br> It's pretty late. 2:00.<br> I could dance all night with my Billikins.<br> My little fuzzy-wuzzy's got to<br> get some sleep though.<br> You're kind of cute when you say that.<br> So I'm going to say good night,<br> Mrs. Chandler.<br> - I'm off to get some air.<br> - Air?<br> Yes, I haven't been able to sleep<br> for the last two or three nights.<br> Must be insomnia.<br> I can fix that. My father used to have it.<br> When he did, I'd rub his head<br> with cologne, like that.<br> I'll go get the cologne.<br> It isn't that kind of insomnia.<br> You know, different people<br> respond to different things.<br> Some people respond to rub-a-dub<br> on the forehead. Others drop off to music.<br> Now, me...<br> - I'm a horse's hoof man.<br> - A what?<br> A horse's hoof man.<br> That's what it takes to put me to sleep.<br> The sound of a horse's hoof. Hoof, hoof.<br> You know? Hoof, hoof.<br> Good?<br> Are you amenable to reason?<br> Then you will come to my charity bazaar.<br> No.<br> You turned me down for the horse show.<br> But I ride with you every morning.<br> You scorned my bid to a concert.<br> But I strum my guitar<br> 'neath thy window each eve.<br> And now you refuse my invitation<br> for tomorrow night.<br> But I'm dining with you and Father<br> this evening.<br> It's your last meal, my lad.<br> I'm beginning to tumble.<br> I do very well for the back streets...<br> but you're ashamed<br> to be seen with me in public.<br> Certainly. A gal who smears<br> mustard all over her chin.<br> Thanks.<br> - Beautiful now?<br> - No, just clean.<br> Stop turning my head.<br> Now, for the purpose of the record,<br> what time will you arrive at the bazaar?<br> Once and for all,<br> I am not attending the bazaar.<br> Bill, what is it?<br> What is it?<br> It is a horse.<br> Let's stop clowning.<br> There's something wrong.<br> - Tell me. What is it?<br> - I can't.<br> Why? Please.<br> I swore I'd never mention it again.<br> The libel suit?<br> What's that got to do<br> with your coming to my party?<br> Plenty.<br> Connie, drop the suit, will you?<br> I know you feel that the paper<br> hit you deliberately.<br> Of course it was deliberate,<br> to hurt my father.<br> - So you're striking back.<br> - And you think I'm heartless.<br> No, just foolish.<br> You think you're gonna end all publicity...<br> but instead, you'll be smeared<br> over every paper in the country.<br> And I don't care, because...<br> Let's not go all over it again.<br> You asked for it.<br> That's why I won't be seen with you<br> in public.<br> All you need now<br> is one more good scandal.<br> Why is there any scandal<br> in my being seen with you?<br> Because you're in the public eye<br> more than ever.<br> If the gossip columns link your name<br> with a man's now...<br> don't you see that it's going<br> to make you light, cheap?<br> You're taking this<br> much too seriously, darling.<br> - After all, it's my fight.<br> - And that makes it mine.<br> You're sweet.<br> If I had $5 million,<br> I'd give it to settle this thing.<br> Shall I drop it, Bill?<br> - Will you?<br> - I'll tell you tomorrow at the party.<br> Now you'll have to come.<br> How about the Athletic Club? Try the Yale.<br> Try it again! I've got to get him!<br> Two hours late.<br> This guy is driving me mad.<br> He hasn't seen her in 10 days.<br> I can't make it out.<br> It's not the old Chandler.<br> Hello? Try his apartment.<br> No use.<br> Mrs. Chandler was calling from there.<br> She's looking for him, too.<br> - Didn't you tell her I was here?<br> - She wanted him.<br> She's afraid he's offended at something<br> she said this morning.<br> She wanted to apologize.<br> Gladys wanted to apologize?<br> He was to meet her at lunch<br> and didn't come.<br> She wanted us to try the morgue<br> in case of an accident.<br> She never tried the morgue for me.<br> - Say, what's going on here?<br> - Maybe he's working on the wrong girl.<br> Working on the...<br> What are you talking about?<br> After all, she's his wife.<br> She may be his wife,<br> but she's engaged to me!<br> The boss wants to see you right away,<br> Mr. Haggerty.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> His wife.<br> What about this fellow Chandler?<br> I thought he was supposed to be clever.<br> He's clever, all right.<br> A lot cleverer than I thought he was.<br> What are you talking about?<br> He hasn't seen<br> this Allenbury girl in 10 days.<br> Do you call that being clever?<br> Great scott, man.<br> Do you realize what this means?<br> More than you know.<br> It's your business to find out<br> what he's been doing.<br> That's just exactly it.<br> I'm going to take<br> the matter into my own hands.<br> I'm going to see<br> Connie Allenbury personally.<br> Why do you think she will see you?<br> Mr. Bane, when I was a reporter,<br> I'd get into places...<br> that even a second-story man<br> couldn't break into.<br> All right, try it. Make her see.<br> Appeal to her reason.<br> She has none. This is Connie Allenbury,<br> international playgirl...<br> the spoiled daughter<br> without a brain in her head!<br> But I know how to handle her kind.<br> I'm gonna throw myself on her mercy<br> and appeal to her heart.<br> I'm going to give her all the sob stuff!<br> You know, Miss Allenbury,<br> this situation has outgrown a petty fight.<br> We've got to consider<br> the humanitarian aspect.<br> I must appeal to your social conscience.<br> Thanks. I didn't know your paper<br> thought I had one.<br> Now, now.<br> If you go through with this case...<br> it's going to throw 500 people<br> out of employment.<br> Men and women, jobless,<br> walking the streets...<br> women like yourself,<br> tired, cold, and hungry.<br> - Driven to drink and ruin.<br> - You write the editorials, don't you?<br> Yes. Now, I know what you're thinking.<br> You're saying to yourself,<br> it's not my fault if people starve.<br> - It's the fault of the paper.<br> - Isn't it?<br> No, it's my fault, it's my mistake.<br> And all my life I shall be faced<br> with the knowledge...<br> that I have wrecked<br> the lives of 500 people.<br> That's all I care about, Miss Allenbury.<br> Those poor, unfortunate souls.<br> After all, they shouldn't suffer for...<br> You're right, they shouldn't suffer<br> for your mistakes.<br> Miss Allenbury. Thank you.<br> I knew you'd feel this way.<br> - They must be taken care of.<br> - Heaven bless you, Connie. Miss Allenbury.<br> And you, too, for calling it to my attention.<br> I shall see to it personally...<br> that the whole $5 million<br> goes into a trust fund for them.<br> You mean you're gonna<br> go ahead with the case?<br> I must, to get the $5 million.<br> Now I shall push it doubly hard.<br> Now I have a cause.<br> But the paper will go under. It will fold.<br> Yes, I know,<br> but you said that was secondary.<br> The main thing is to take care of<br> these poor men and women.<br> Yes, I know, but there<br> are other considerations.<br> Is there anything in this house<br> for a hungry man?<br> - Yoo-hoo.<br> - Hello, my sweet.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - Hello.<br> Dear, Mr. Haggerty of the New York Star.<br> Mr. Chandler.<br> Well, not William Chandler, the writer?<br> Yes, I'm William Chandler.<br> He writes travel books.<br> That takes you to a lot<br> of interesting places, doesn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Of course, it's all in the day's work.<br> I'm just becoming familiar with your work.<br> Yes?<br> I thought perhaps<br> you might do something for our paper.<br> It'd be a little change<br> from what you're doing now.<br> I'm afraid that I'm pretty full up.<br> - Up to your neck, I suppose.<br> - I object. No more work.<br> - Do sit down, Mr. Haggerty.<br> - Thank you.<br> I only see him now once a day.<br> Connie, you mustn't exaggerate.<br> If we must be factual,<br> twice a day sometimes, maybe three.<br> You'll give Mr. Haggerty<br> the wrong impression.<br> After all, he's a newspaperman.<br> - Don't worry about impressing me.<br> - And besides, he's not a columnist.<br> He didn't come to discuss gossip.<br> He came to discuss the case.<br> Yes, the case. By all means.<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> - And it's all settled.<br> You mean you're dropping the suit?<br> No, but thanks to Mr. Haggerty's<br> social conscience...<br> all of the employees will be taken care of...<br> with the $5 million<br> I shall win from the Star.<br> That was all he cared about,<br> wasn't it, Mr. Haggerty?<br> Absolutely all. And now that you've<br> been so generous...<br> I think I'll say thank you and run along.<br> Please don't hurry.<br> You spoke of other considerations.<br> They really don't matter at all.<br> Just so long as those poor men<br> and women don't starve.<br> You've taken a great load off my mind.<br> - Have I?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> I don't think there's<br> another thing to discuss.<br> There certainly is not.<br> I'm Warren Haggerty, the managing editor<br> of the New York Evening Star.<br> I know. The butler told me you were here.<br> - He'll show you to your car.<br> - Then I won't keep him waiting.<br> And you can tell your owner,<br> Mr. Hollis Bane...<br> we're not entertaining anyone<br> from his yellow rag in this house.<br> I'll make it a point to tell him.<br> You're entertaining no representatives<br> of the Evening Star.<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> Miss Allenbury, good night.<br> It's a surprise, Mr. Chandler,<br> but a great pleasure seeing you here.<br> Hello? Hello, Gladys?<br> Yes.<br> What?<br> You just saw him there a minute ago?<br> He's been seeing her every day?<br> Sure. He's been protecting her.<br> He's in love with her.<br> That's why he's stalling us.<br> But we got him now, and the case, too.<br> How long will it take you<br> to get to the Allenburys'?<br> A half hour? Perfect.<br> Sure, he'll be there.<br> He can't get away.<br> He was just going in to dinner when I left.<br> Thattagirl. Tear the roof off.<br> And get in touch with me at the office...<br> as soon as you've done your stuff.<br> Right. Bye-bye.<br> By this time tomorrow,<br> I'll be dining on shipboard.<br> - What? Where do you think you're going?<br> - I'm having dinner with my publisher.<br> He's sailing on the Victoria tomorrow,<br> the 8th.<br> Today is the 8th.<br> No, tomorrow is the 8th. Friday the 8th.<br> No, Bill. Today is Friday.<br> Today?<br> - What?<br> - Of course. Friday the 8h.<br> This is terrible.<br> He has a contract waiting for me to sign.<br> I've got to see him.<br> What time does the ship sail?<br> - 11:00, from Brooklyn.<br> - You can make it.<br> - I'll drive you in.<br> - No, you finish your dinner.<br> I have my own car here.<br> I'm so sorry. This is terrible.<br> Mr. Chandler's apartment, please.<br> And would you rush it?<br> Yes?<br> Don't you "Hello, Gladdie" me,<br> Bill Chandler.<br> So you were having dinner<br> with your publisher.<br> You've been handing me a line<br> of pretty talk for the past 10 days...<br> and all the time<br> you've been seeing Connie Allenbury.<br> You can't do that to me.<br> Don't forget you're my husband...<br> and I'm telling that<br> to Miss Allenbury tonight.<br> Now, Gladys, that doesn't sound like you.<br> I don't blame you for being upset,<br> but I can explain everything.<br> Will you meet me<br> at the Paradise Roof in 20 minutes?<br> All right, I'll meet you.<br> But nothing you can say will stop me...<br> from telling that Allenbury gal tonight.<br> Remember that.<br> Here's the headline proof<br> on the Allenbury yarn.<br> Swell, elegant, magnificent.<br> We'll write in the gory details<br> when we hear from Gladys.<br> What's keeping her? It's after 12:00.<br> The old man's probably trying to bribe her.<br> Say, that'll make a swell subhead.<br> "Rich father tries to bribe wronged wife."<br> I wonder where that<br> skunk Chandler is now.<br> He probably ducked<br> to China or Africa or something.<br> Hello, Warren.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - Dancing.<br> - What did you say?<br> - Dancing.<br> You know...<br> You mean you didn't go<br> to the Allenburys'? You didn't...<br> - No, we decided against it.<br> - Why you...<br> Self-control, Warren.<br> Very important for a man your age.<br> Here. Throw this out. Go on.<br> Now what have you got<br> to say for yourselves?<br> - Don't shout, Warren. We're not used to it.<br> - Are you going to tell me what happened?<br> You'd better tell him, Bill.<br> His blood pressure...<br> Yes. Perhaps you're right.<br> Warren, what would you say if I told you...<br> that I had almost persuaded<br> Miss Allenbury to drop the case?<br> I'd say you were a dirty,<br> double-dealing liar, and I'd be right.<br> I won't stand here<br> and listen to you being insulted.<br> Come on, Bill.<br> Is that so? Wait. Listen to this.<br> Not four hours ago,<br> I heard your two-timing Romeo...<br> whispering sweet nothings<br> into the ears of Connie Allenbury.<br> What do you think of that?<br> Bill told me all about it. That's technique,<br> Warren. You wouldn't understand it.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> you were seeing Connie Allenbury?<br> Sure, and have you spoil<br> all my good work...<br> as you did tonight, barging in...<br> just as I'd about convinced her<br> to drop the case.<br> We didn't need any charity from her.<br> All Gladys had to do<br> was bust into the house.<br> As Bill says, and have you<br> smear our names all over your paper...<br> you headline hunter.<br> Believe me, this way is better and cleaner.<br> Tomorrow evening, the Allenburys<br> are giving a party. I'll be there.<br> Go right ahead, Bill. I trust you.<br> And what's more, I'll get her to drop<br> this case, once and for all.<br> That is, unless you decide<br> to barge in again.<br> You're so obvious, Warren.<br> Why can't you be subtle, like Bill?<br> Are you gonna listen to him or me?<br> I'm going to listen to Bill. He knows best.<br> How do I know<br> that you can get Connie to drop the case?<br> You'll have to take my word for that.<br> That's good enough for me.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Maybe this is the best way.<br> Now you're talking sense.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> I'm sorry I blew up, old man.<br> Think nothing of it.<br> Now you see how silly it was<br> to get excited, Warren.<br> After all, I do want you boys<br> to be good friends.<br> - Come on, Bill. Good night, Warren.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, old man.<br> - Good night.<br> What's up?<br> That low-down, conniving rat...<br> making Gladys believe<br> he's in love with her.<br> - He won't get away with it.<br> - Can you stop him?<br> I'm going to wash up the Allenbury case<br> and Mr. Chandler with it.<br> Gladys may be eating out of his hand now,<br> but before I get through, she'll be biting it.<br> Here, son. Tell Douglas to print up<br> one copy of the evening edition.<br> Put that item at the head<br> of the society column.<br> - One copy?<br> - That's what I said.<br> Our circulation is certainly falling off.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Gladdie!<br> What are you doing here?<br> Can't a girl have any privacy?<br> I had to see you. I got great news.<br> It better be good,<br> bursting in on me like this.<br> It's about Bill. Say, I certainly had<br> that guy all wrong. He's a wonder.<br> Congratulations. When did you come<br> out of the ether?<br> I was a sap to ever doubt him.<br> He just called me a minute ago.<br> Told me he's getting Connie<br> to drop the suit tonight.<br> Then off he goes on<br> an around-the-world cruise...<br> ending up at the altar...<br> spliced to an eight-figure fortune.<br> What a man.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You know he's got those Allenburys<br> right in the palm of his hand.<br> "It seems the charity bazaar<br> at the Allenbury house tonight...<br> "is something in the way of<br> a farewell party.<br> "J. B. Allenbury and his attractive<br> daughter, Connie, are sailing...<br> "for a four-months, around-the-world<br> cruise on the S.S. San Ramone.<br> "Accompanying them on this cruise<br> will be Connie's current favorite...<br> "William Chandler.<br> "Do we hear wedding bells?"<br> - How do you like that?<br> - Let me see that paper.<br> I have to run. Just thought<br> you'd like to hear the good news.<br> Somebody get me out of here!<br> Get me out of here!<br> Have a photographer<br> at Allenbury's home at 9:00.<br> - There's gonna be fireworks there tonight.<br> - Right.<br> Step this way for the great game of skill.<br> Darto. Throw a dart<br> and win a beautiful prize.<br> $1 a dart, and cheap at half the price.<br> Woo lady luck at the wheel of chance.<br> Pick the winning number<br> and win a priceless prize for the lady.<br> Come one, come all.<br> Look, ring the neck of a bottle<br> and win a baby doll.<br> No trick, no deception.<br> Pure, unadulterated skill.<br> Yes, sir. How many?<br> Where's Connie? I must see Connie.<br> I'm so anxious to tell her<br> about Mr. Chandler's wife.<br> - Mr. Chandler's wife?<br> - Yes.<br> You know Chandler, the fish man<br> on the boat? We met his wife.<br> A most amazing creature.<br> But nonsense. He's not married.<br> We never dreamed he was married.<br> He didn't look married<br> and he certainly didn't act married.<br> The married ones never do.<br> I'm sure there's a mistake.<br> No, there isn't. We saw him this afternoon<br> coming out of the hotel.<br> We called him, both of us,<br> but he was getting into a taxi.<br> Let's have a drink.<br> I had to run half a block,<br> trying to make him see me.<br> But he'd gone. So we went into the hotel<br> to leave a message.<br> The clerk asked<br> if we wished to speak to his wife.<br> I said, "Naturally." He said that<br> she was in the beauty shop.<br> We saw her. My dear, she's a case.<br> A psychopathic case.<br> She was in a booth, and she kept<br> screaming, "Let me out of here!"<br> Before we could speak to her,<br> she rushed past us.<br> Look, there's Connie<br> and Mr. Chandler now.<br> All ready. Hold still, please.<br> Why, grandma, what big muscles<br> you've got.<br> The better to sock you with, grandpa.<br> Hold still.<br> You wait here. I'll get them.<br> We'll make a party of it.<br> Waitress. Mary,<br> champagne cocktails for five, please.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Queen of the air.<br> Now, now. One at a time, please.<br> Connie, I must see you.<br> What is it, dear?<br> I can't talk to you here.<br> - But Bill...<br> - He'll keep.<br> Thank you.<br> Connie?<br> I've been robbed.<br> Driver, can't you go any faster?<br> I can, lady, but the cab can't.<br> Now, what is it?<br> I haven't seen you this worried<br> since I stole your favorite fishing rod.<br> Connie, how much does<br> Chandler mean to you?<br> - Not jealous, are you?<br> - Are you in love with him?<br> Terribly.<br> More than I ever dreamed<br> I could care for anyone.<br> You're sure?<br> I'm sure. Why? You like him, don't you?<br> Of course.<br> Then what are you<br> being so mysterious about?<br> What is it, Dad?<br> The Burns-Norvells say he's married.<br> I don't believe it.<br> You know the Burns-Norvells.<br> I'm afraid it's true, Connie.<br> They've even met the woman.<br> No. I don't believe it. I won't.<br> Now, Connie, please.<br> And yet it explains so much.<br> Why we've always had to meet alone...<br> It's hideous suspecting him...<br> - and yet...<br> - We've got to know.<br> - Roberts?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Ask Mr. Chandler to come here, please.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - But let me ask him, Dad.<br> - No, Connie.<br> Please. It's my problem.<br> Let me handle it my own way.<br> You're sure you don't want me to...<br> You'll ask him point-blank<br> so that he can't misunderstand?<br> Yes. I'll ask him<br> so he can't misunderstand.<br> Go on, darling. I'm all right.<br> And so the flying princess,<br> tired of this Earth...<br> flew back to her home, the moon.<br> - There isn't any princess.<br> - No?<br> There isn't any moon.<br> Just Connie. That's all right with me.<br> Say, I'm glad you ducked out.<br> It's much nicer here.<br> Bill, there's something I've got to ask you.<br> Animal, vegetable, or mineral?<br> It's just...<br> I don't know where to begin.<br> What is it, darling?<br> We've had such fun together,<br> such happy times.<br> But, Connie, darling, what's the matter?<br> What's happened?<br> There's a question.<br> Well?<br> It's the most important question<br> I'll ever ask.<br> Just answer yes or no, but don't explain.<br> If it's no, don't explain.<br> Well, go ahead.<br> Wait till I catch my breath.<br> Bill, have you been proposed to much?<br> Have I been what?<br> You know, proposed to?<br> Your hand in marriage.<br> Well, not enough to turn my head.<br> - Why?<br> - I'm asking you to marry me.<br> What?<br> - Is that the question?<br> - Yes.<br> Will you marry me?<br> Well, Connie...<br> Will you?<br> What do you think?<br> - When?<br> - When?<br> Now?<br> Now? You mean soon?<br> I mean now, tonight.<br> Tonight?<br> - Will you, Bill?<br> - Will I?<br> Is there a preacher in the house?<br> - Not here. We'll take the car. We'll drive...<br> - To the moon.<br> - Awfully glad you've enjoyed it.<br> - Thanks to you.<br> - Pardon me, Mr. Allenbury.<br> - What is it, Roberts?<br> There's a person here who claims to be<br> Mrs. William Chandler.<br> She wants to see<br> Mr. Chandler immediately.<br> Where is she?<br> I took the liberty of asking her<br> to wait on the terrace, sir.<br> Thank you, Roberts. I'll see her.<br> Good evening. I'm Mr. Allenbury.<br> Yes? I'm Mrs. William Chandler,<br> and I can prove it, too.<br> - You'll have every opportunity to do so.<br> - I'll say I will.<br> I want my husband. Where is he?<br> Your husband will be returned<br> to you intact, Mrs. Chandler.<br> Just as soon as I can find him.<br> - I'll go with you.<br> - No.<br> I think it would be wiser<br> if you stayed here.<br> - So, you're afraid I'll make a scene.<br> - On the contrary, I'm looking forward to it.<br> I'll bring your husband to you directly.<br> - Follow that roadster.<br> - I got it.<br> Perfect. Don't lose them,<br> and try to get pictures.<br> - Right. I won't lose them.<br> - I'll be getting the special edition ready.<br> William Stevens Chandler.<br> Ever been married before?<br> Not to speak of.<br> My wife will be the witness.<br> She'll be down in a minute.<br> Here she is now.<br> - Are they sober?<br> - I think so.<br> This is love, not liquor.<br> Join hands, please.<br> William, do you take Constance<br> to be your lawful wife...<br> to have and to hold, in sickness<br> and in health...<br> to love, honor, and cherish...<br> - Did you get Gladys on the phone?<br> - Sure.<br> What did you say?<br> That I was looking for you<br> with some important information.<br> - And?<br> - She fell like a log.<br> She asked me what information I had,<br> so I dropped the bomb.<br> I told her I was driving by the Grand Plaza<br> and saw Connie and Bill go in.<br> On investigating, I found they'd been<br> assigned to suite 805 and 807...<br> as man and wife.<br> - What did she say?<br> - What didn't she say?<br> You know, I've been thinking...<br> that was a justice of the peace<br> they called on.<br> - Maybe he really did marry her.<br> - How could he? He's got a wife already.<br> - I know, but...<br> - There's Gladys now.<br> Okay, buddy.<br> We're off to the races. You wait here.<br> So?<br> - Gladys, this is a surprise.<br> - I'll bet it is.<br> I'm sorry to break into your little party,<br> Miss Connie Allenbury...<br> but this man happens to be my husband.<br> This is the lady I told you about,<br> a Miss Gladys Benton.<br> - "Mrs. William Chandler" is the name.<br> - Yes. How do you do?<br> - I said, "Mrs. William Chandler."<br> - I've been looking forward to meeting you.<br> - Bill's told me so much about you.<br> - He told you about me?<br> Yes. Won't you sit down?<br> No, you don't.<br> You're not getting out of here!<br> I'm not leaving.<br> I just don't want Warren to miss anything.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Could you hear all right,<br> or shall we start over?<br> Hello, Mr. Haggerty. Do come in.<br> So nice to see you. Let's all sit down.<br> Yes, let's.<br> What are you doing here?<br> - Naturally, she didn't expect you.<br> - I didn't know he was out there.<br> This has nothing to do with you<br> or your newspaper, so you keep out of it.<br> As Mrs. William Chandler, I demand...<br> There must be some mistake.<br> You see, this is Mrs. Chandler.<br> - What?<br> - What?<br> Yes. And has been for a whole hour.<br> - Yes, we were just married.<br> - Have you gone crazy?<br> If you think you can excuse this<br> by pulling a marriage gag...<br> But we are married. Really.<br> Yes. I always carry<br> our marriage certificate right with me.<br> - They're married, all right.<br> - But that's arson.<br> You mean it's bigamy!<br> What a story.<br> Connie Allenbury marries bigamist.<br> Print that in the paper, you'll have<br> another libel suit on your hands.<br> - I'm not a bigamist.<br> - You married me, didn't you?<br> - That one doesn't count.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> About a certain Mr. Joseph Simpson,<br> your lawfully wedded husband.<br> What are you trying to hand me?<br> I've been divorced...<br> You got your divorce in Yucatn, by mail.<br> Three years ago,<br> all Yucatn divorces were declared illegal.<br> I found that out yesterday<br> in the Hall of Records.<br> I also consulted my attorney.<br> Then you and Gladys<br> were never really married?<br> - That's right.<br> - But I made an honest man of him.<br> Dear, don't forget the letter.<br> Yes.<br> This is from Mrs. Chandler, for you.<br> Warren, she was so touched by your pity...<br> - for your 500 starving employees...<br> - You've dropped the suit!<br> - But l...<br> - Connie. Miss Allen... Mrs. Chandler.<br> How can I ever...<br> I just can't thank you enough.<br> Connie Allenbury marries author.<br> What a story! What a scoop!<br> Mr. Haggerty, you've forgotten something.<br> - Yes. My hat. Excuse me.<br> - Your hat and Mrs. Simpson.<br> Mrs. Simpson? Gladdie, of course.<br> That "Mrs. Simpson" gets me, Gladdie.<br> I've got to run along to the office.<br> You phone me there in the morning.<br> Just a minute. You want a real scoop?<br> I'll give you one!<br> I found out my Yucatn divorce<br> was no good...<br> so I got a second divorce<br> from Joe Simpson in Reno.<br> - What?<br> - What?<br> - Then, we're not...<br> - I don't believe it.<br> Then try the Reno Hall of Records.<br> - But...<br> - That's quite right.<br> Now where do we all stand?<br> Let's all sit down<br> and talk things over quietly.<br> You and I will have plenty of time<br> to talk this over on our world cruise.<br> I'm sure Miss Allenbury won't mind<br> turning her ticket over to me now.<br> Ticket? World cruise?<br> What are you talking about?<br> You're getting all excited.<br> Now come along...<br> What about this?<br> - It's nothing, Bill.<br> - Yes, what about this?<br> I can explain that thing.<br> I had to use it as a little gag...<br> So it's just one of your little gags<br> to get me here!<br> I'm here, all right.<br> Before I'm through,<br> you'll all be sorry you ever saw me.<br> You were all terribly smart, weren't you?<br> You were all building up<br> to a nice happy ending.<br> Haggerty wins his case.<br> Chandler wins his girl.<br> Where do I stand?<br> I'll tell you where,<br> right behind the eight ball.<br> You thought it was a lot of fun, didn't you,<br> making me fall for you?<br> Well, I did fall.<br> But I'm picking myself up,<br> William Chandler.<br> You can't fool me any more with your<br> hoof, hoof, hoof...<br> or your insomnia or your publisher.<br> You're a pretty poor sample of a husband.<br> But nobody else is gonna get you,<br> not if it kills both of us.<br> - Now look, Gladys...<br> - You're 10 times worse than he is!<br> At least he had some excuse<br> for kicking me around.<br> He was in love with another woman.<br> But you double-crossed me<br> for the sake of a newspaper!<br> Marry the paper and be the proud father<br> of a lot of headlines!<br> That's all you're good for anyway.<br> I suppose this is all very distasteful<br> to you, Miss Allenbury.<br> You're not accustomed<br> to hearing the truth.<br> You've had money to protect you<br> from it all your life!<br> You spent your entire life<br> buying anything you want.<br> My husband isn't for sale.<br> You can't buy him at any price!<br> - Will you let me go?<br> - You can't walk out on me like this!<br> Gladdie!<br> Wait a minute. Wait.<br> Let me handle this.<br> You two diplomats have done enough.<br> - I'm afraid it's locked.<br> - Then please give me the key.<br> - Not yet. I want to talk to you.<br> - I've talked enough.<br> Right. Now it's my turn.<br> - You can't offer me money...<br> - I wouldn't think of it.<br> Pleading won't do you any good.<br> - I'm sure.<br> - What else is there to talk about?<br> - You.<br> - Me?<br> I've a pretty fair notion<br> of what you've been through.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - Any woman can be starved by neglect.<br> The little attentions<br> Bill paid you seemed so much greater...<br> because you weren't getting them<br> from Haggerty.<br> The only time he sent me flowers,<br> he signed it "Bill."<br> Exactly. He probably never noticed<br> the clothes you wore...<br> never told you how<br> lovely you looked, the way Bill did.<br> That's right. How did you know?<br> Women can't fool women about men.<br> - You don't want Bill.<br> - Oh, no?<br> I know you've got him now,<br> in name anyway.<br> But I have his love.<br> You can't build a life<br> on hate, or a marriage on spite.<br> Marriage is too important.<br> - Mine only lasted an hour, but I know.<br> - I'm not gonna listen to you!<br> A fine mess you made of this,<br> and all because you tried to steal Gladys!<br> I wouldn't steal Gladys<br> if she were the last female on earth.<br> Female? That does it!<br> You can't stand there and insult Gladdie.<br> You've had this coming for a long time.<br> Yes, and I've been looking forward to it!<br> - We'll settle it right now!<br> - With interest.<br> I don't love Warren Haggerty.<br> I'll never love him!<br> I never want to see him.<br> I never want to hear his name! I hate him!<br> - They're fighting!<br> - Warren!<br> Wait a minute!<br> Don't be a sucker.<br> You hear who she is calling?<br> Now, are you satisfied?<br> Say, I got an idea.<br> She'll feel sorrier for you<br> if I punch you in the nose.<br> Warren, darling!<br> Why, Bill!<br> I treated you terribly<br> and now you are hurt.<br> It's my fault, darling.<br> I'm just a mug, Gladdie, but I love you.<br> Let me see.<br> You're bleeding!<br> You big coward, you must have hit him<br> when his back was turned.<br> How dare you?<br> Are you all right?<br> What is this? What's going on here?<br> Hello, Father.<br> I got your telephone call. What's this?<br> Now be calm, please.<br> - I can explain everything.<br> - You'd better explain fast!<br> - You mean to tell me you married him?<br> - Yes, Father.<br> - Who is this woman?<br> - That's Bill's wife.<br> What?<br> Quiet, will you please be quiet!<br>
