                        So you were raised in a zoo?<br> Born and raised.<br> In Pondicherry, in what was<br> the French part of India.<br> My father owned the zoo...<br> and I was delivered on short<br> notice by a herpetologist...<br> who was there to check<br> on the Bengal monitor lizard.<br> Mother and I<br> were both healthy...<br> but the poor lizard escaped...<br> and was trampled<br> by a frightened cassowary.<br> The way of karma, huh?<br> The way of God.<br> That's quite a story.<br> I had assumed your father was a<br> mathematician<br> because of your name.<br> Far from it, I was named<br> after a swimming pool.<br> There is a swimming pool named "Pi"?<br> You see,<br> my uncle Francis was born<br> with too much<br> water in his lungs.<br> They say the doctors<br> swung Francis around<br> by the ankles to<br> clear the water out...<br> and that's what gave him the<br> huge chest and skinny legs...<br> that made him<br> such a great swimmer.<br> Is Francis actually your uncle?<br> He said he was<br> friends with your father.<br> He's my honorary uncle,<br> I call him Mamaji.<br> My father's best friend,<br> my swimming guru.<br> I trained with him three<br> times a week at the ashram.<br> His lessons would save my<br> life in the end.<br> A mouthful of water will not<br> harm you, but panic will.<br> Remember to breathe now,<br> don't hold your breath.<br> Good boy.<br> I hope you don't<br> mind vegetarian.<br> No, no. Not at all.<br> And your name?<br> Huh?<br> You were going to tell me how<br> you got your name, I think.<br> Oh, yes. I got it from something<br> Mamaji once told my father.<br> You see, most travelers collect<br> postcards or teacups<br> on their journeys...<br> but not Mamaji.<br> Mamaji collects swimming pools.<br> He swims in every<br> pool he comes upon.<br> One day, Mamaji<br> said to my father that,<br> of all the pools<br> in the world...<br> the most beautiful was<br> a public pool in Paris.<br> That the water<br> there was so clear,<br> you could make your<br> morning coffee with it.<br> That a single swim<br> there changed his life.<br> Before I was born, he said...<br> "If you want your son<br> to have a clean soul...<br> you must take him one day to<br> swim in the Piscine Molitor."<br> I never understood why my father<br> took this so much to heart.<br> But he did, and I was named<br> "Piscine Molitor Patel."<br> Imagine me trying<br> to explain that name.<br> I barely made it to<br> the age of 11 before...<br> Hey, Piscine!<br> Are you pissing right now?<br> Look at him, he's pissing!<br> With one word, my name went from<br> an elegant French swimming pool...<br> to a stinking Indian latrine.<br> I was "Pissing" everywhere.<br> No Pissing in the schoolyard!<br> Even the teachers<br> started doing it.<br> Not deliberately, of course.<br> So, then, what might occur<br> if we release gas too quickly?<br> Pissing?<br> He said "Pissing."<br> That's enough!<br> Order! Order!<br> When we returned the next<br> year for our first day of school,<br> I was prepared.<br> Present, sir.<br> Piscine Patel.<br> Good morning.<br> I am Piscine Molitor Patel.<br> Known to all as...<br> Pi, the sixteenth letter<br> of the Greek alphabet...<br> which is also used in mathematics<br> to represent the ratio...<br> of any circle's circumference<br> to its diameter.<br> An irrational number<br> of infinite length,<br> usually rounded<br> to three digits...<br> as 3.14.<br> Pi.<br> Very impressive, Pi.<br> Now, sit down.<br> And from then on,<br> you were "Pi"?<br> Well, no, not quite.<br> Nice try, Pissing.<br> But I still had the whole<br> day ahead of me.<br> French class was next.<br> Je m'appelle<br> Piscine Molitor Patel.<br> Dit Pi.<br> Then, geography.<br> These are the first<br> My last class of the<br> day was mathematics.<br> Slowly, slowly, slowly.<br> Three.<br> Seven. Five. Eight. Nine.<br> Eight. Five. Eight. Nine.<br> It's right.<br> He's really doing this.<br> Pi! Pi! Pi!<br> By the end of that day,<br> I was Pi Patel, school legend.<br> Um, Mamaji tells me you're a<br> legend among sailors, too.<br> Out there, all alone.<br> Oh, I don't even know<br> how to sail.<br> And I wasn't alone out there.<br> Richard Parker was with me.<br> Richard Parker?<br> Mamaji didn't tell me<br> everything.<br> He just said I should look you<br> up when I got back to Montreal.<br> So, what were you<br> doing in Pondicherry?<br> Writing a novel.<br> By the way,<br> I enjoyed your first book.<br> So, this new one,<br> is it set in India?<br> No, Portugal, actually. But<br> it's cheaper living in India.<br> Ah, well, I look<br> forward to reading it.<br> You can't.<br> I threw it out.<br> Two years trying to bring<br> this thing to life...<br> and then one day, it<br> sputtered, coughed and died.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Uh, I was sitting in this coffee<br> house in Pondicherry one afternoon,<br> mourning my loss...<br> when this old man at the table next<br> to me struck up a conversation.<br> Yeah, Mamaji, he does that.<br> When I told him about my<br> abandoned book, he said...<br> "So, a<br> Canadian who's come to French India<br> in search of a story."<br> "Well, my friend, I know an<br> Indian in French Canada...<br> with the most<br> incredible story to tell."<br> "It must be fate that the<br> two of you should meet."<br> Well, I haven't spoken about<br> Richard Parker in so many years.<br> So, what has<br> Mamaji already told you?<br> He said you had a story that<br> would make me believe in God.<br> He would<br> say that about a nice meal.<br> As for God, I can only<br> tell you my story.<br> You will decide for yourself<br> what you believe.<br> Fair enough.<br> Let's see, then.<br> Where to begin?<br> Pondicherry is the<br> French Riviera of India.<br> In the streets<br> closest to the ocean,<br> you might think you were<br> in the south of France.<br> A few blocks inland,<br> there's a canal.<br> Just beyond that<br> is Indian Pondicherry.<br> And the Muslim quarter<br> is just to the west.<br> When the French handed Pondicherry<br> back to us in 1954...<br> the town decided that some sort<br> of commemoration was in order.<br> My father, who was a clever<br> businessman, came up with one.<br> He ran a hotel, and he got<br> the idea to open a zoo...<br> in the local<br> botanical gardens instead.<br> As it also happened, my mother<br> was a botanist in the gardens.<br> They met, married, and a year<br> later my brother Ravi was born.<br> I came two years after that.<br> It sounds magical,<br> growing up in...<br> Amen.<br> Yeah, let's eat.<br> I didn't know<br> Hindus said "amen."<br> Catholic Hindus do.<br> Catholic Hindus?<br> We get to feel guilty before hundreds<br> of gods, instead of just one.<br> But you're a Hindu first?<br> None of us knows God<br> until someone introduces us.<br> I was first introduced<br> to God as a Hindu.<br> There are 33 million gods<br> in the Hindu religion.<br> How can I not come to<br> know a few of them?<br> I met Krishna first.<br> Yashoda once accused<br> baby Krishna of eating dirt.<br> "Tut, tut you naughty boy -<br> you shouldn't do that."<br> But he didn't!<br> That's what he told her.<br> "I didn't eat dirt."<br> Yashoda said,<br> "No? Well then..."<br> "Open your mouth."<br> So Krishna opened his mouth.<br> And what do you think<br> Yashoda saw?<br> What?<br> She saw in Krishna's mouth<br> the whole entire universe.<br> The gods were my<br> superheroes growing up.<br> Hanuman, the monkey god...<br> lifting an entire mountain<br> to save his friend Lakshman.<br> Ganesh, the elephant-headed...<br> risking his life to defend the<br> honor of his mother, Parvati.<br> Vishnu, the supreme soul,<br> the source of all things.<br> Vishnu sleeps, floating on the<br> shoreless cosmic ocean...<br> and we are<br> the stuff of his dreaming.<br> Spectacle.<br> Don't let these stories and<br> pretty lights fool you, boys.<br> Religion is darkness.<br> My dear appa believed<br> himself part of the new India.<br> As a child, he had had polio.<br> He used to lie in bed racked with<br> pain, wondering where God was.<br> In the end, God didn't save<br> him, Western medicine did.<br> My amma went to college...<br> and thought her family was part<br> of the new India as well...<br> until her parents<br> cut her off...<br> because they thought<br> she was marrying beneath her.<br> Her religion was the only<br> link she had to her past.<br> I met Christ in the<br> mountains when I was 12.<br> We were visiting relatives,<br> tea growers in Munnar.<br> It was our third day there.<br> Ravi and I were terribly bored.<br> Challenge.<br> I'll give you two rupees.<br> Run in to that church<br> and drink the holy water.<br> You must be thirsty.<br> Here.<br> I brought you this.<br> Why would a god do that?<br> Why would<br> He send His own son...<br> to suffer for the sins<br> of ordinary people?<br> Because He loves us.<br> God made Himself<br> approachable to us,<br> human,<br> so we could understand Him.<br> We can't understand God<br> in all His perfection.<br> But we can understand God's son<br> and His suffering<br> as we would a brother's.<br> That made no sense.<br> Sacrificing the innocent to atone<br> for the sins of the guilty...<br> What kind of love is that?<br> But this son...<br> I couldn't get<br> him out of my head.<br> If God is so<br> perfect and we are not...<br> why would He want<br> to create all this?<br> Why does He need us at all?<br> All you have to know<br> is that He loves us.<br> God so loved this world<br> that He gave His only son.<br> The longer<br> I listened to the priest...<br> the more I came to like<br> this son of God.<br> Thank you, Vishnu,<br> for introducing me to Christ.<br> I came to faith<br> through Hinduism<br> and I found God's<br> love through Christ.<br> But God wasn't<br> finished with me yet.<br> God works in mysterious ways.<br> And so it was,<br> He introduced Himself again.<br> This time by the name of Allah.<br> Allahu Akbar.<br> My Arabic<br> was never very good...<br> but the sound and feel of the<br> words brought me closer to God.<br> In performing Salah...<br> the ground I touched<br> became holy ground...<br> and I found a feeling<br> of serenity and brotherhood.<br> This lamb is exquisite.<br> It's the best<br> dish on the table.<br> You're all missing out.<br> You only need to convert to three<br> more religions, Piscine...<br> and you will spend your life on holiday.<br> Are you going to Mecca<br> this year, Swami Jesus?<br> Or to Rome for your<br> coronation as Pope Pi-us?<br> You stay out of this, Ravi.<br> Just as you like cricket,<br> Pi has his own interests.<br> No, Gita, Ravi has a point.<br> You cannot follow three different<br> religions at the same time, Piscine.<br> Why not?<br> Because believing in<br> everything at the same time...<br> is the same as not believing<br> in anything at all.<br> He's young, Santosh.<br> He's still finding his way.<br> And how can he find his way<br> if he does not choose a path?<br> Listen, instead of leaping from<br> one religion to the next...<br> why not start with reason?<br> In a few hundred years...<br> science has taken us farther in<br> understanding the universe...<br> than religion has in 10,000.<br> That is true.<br> Your father is right.<br> Science can teach us more<br> about what is out there...<br> but not what is in here.<br> Some eat meat,<br> some eat vegetable.<br> I do not expect us all<br> to agree about everything...<br> but I would much<br> rather have you<br> believe in something<br> I don't agree with...<br> than to accept<br> everything blindly.<br> And that begins<br> with thinking rationally.<br> Do you understand?<br> Good.<br> I would like to be baptized.<br> So, you're a Christian<br> and a Muslim?<br> And a Hindu, of course.<br> And a Jew, I suppose.<br> Well, I do teach a course on the<br> Kabbalah at the university.<br> And why not? Faith is a<br> house with many rooms.<br> But no room for doubt?<br> Oh, plenty.<br> On every floor.<br> Doubt is useful.<br> It keeps faith a living thing.<br> After all, you cannot know<br> the strength of your faith<br> until it's been tested.<br> Where's Selvam? We shouldn't<br> be in here without him.<br> Stop worrying.<br> I have seen him<br> do this a thousand times.<br> I want to meet our new tiger.<br> Pi!<br> Hello? Richard Parker?<br> A tiger? Richard<br> Parker was a tiger?<br> Yeah, he got his name<br> through a clerical error.<br> A hunter caught him drinking from<br> a stream when he was a cub...<br> and named him Thirsty.<br> When Thirsty got too big, the<br> hunter sold him to our zoo...<br> but the names got switched on<br> the paperwork.<br> The hunter was listed<br> as Thirsty,<br> and the tiger<br> was called Richard Parker.<br> We laughed about it,<br> and the name stuck.<br> Let's go...<br> before we get into trouble.<br> I want to see him close up.<br> You're not a zookeeper.<br> Come on!<br> That's it, Richard Parker.<br> It's for you.<br> No!<br> What are you thinking?<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> Who gave you permission<br> to come back here?<br> You have just ignored everything<br> I've ever taught you.<br> I just wanted to<br> say hello to him.<br> You think that tiger<br> is your friend?<br> He's an animal, not a playmate.<br> Animals have souls.<br> I have seen it in their eyes.<br> Find Selvam.<br> You're sure, Sir?<br> Pi's just a boy.<br> Do it. Go ahead!<br> Animals do not think<br> like we do.<br> People who forget that<br> get themselves killed.<br> That tiger is not your friend.<br> When you look into his eyes...<br> you are seeing your own<br> emotions reflected back at you.<br> Nothing else.<br> Don't be stupid.<br> Say you're sorry.<br> What have you done, Piscine?<br> You know what your father<br> said about coming back here.<br> I am sorry. I was...<br> What are you thinking?<br> This is between<br> a father and his sons.<br> He said he's sorry.<br> You want to scar them for life?<br> Scar them?<br> That boy almost lost his arm.<br> But he's still a boy.<br> He will be a man<br> sooner than you think.<br> And this is a lesson I do not<br> want them ever to forget.<br> Selvam!<br> ...and so has placed<br> the country in a state of emergency.<br> Under the directive, the states<br> of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu...<br> will be placed under the direct<br> authority of the central government.<br> Police will be granted powers...<br> to arrest and indefinitely<br> detain citizens<br> responsible for the uprising.<br> Things changed after<br> the day of Appa's lesson.<br> The world had lost<br> some of its enchantment.<br> School was a bore. Nothing but<br> facts, fractions and French.<br> Words and patterns that went<br> on and on, without end.<br> Just like<br> my irrational nickname.<br> I grew restless<br> searching for something<br> that might bring meaning<br> back into my life.<br> And then, I met Anandi.<br> Mother made me study music.<br> And one day, my teacher<br> came down with the flu.<br> He asked if<br> I could take his place,<br> playing rhythms<br> for a dance class.<br> No.<br> If you do not concentrate...<br> you cannot express your<br> love of God through dance.<br> Feel the ground<br> beneath your feet.<br> Open your gaze out<br> onto the horizon.<br> Let that spiritual energy pulse<br> through you and out into the world.<br> Through abhinaya.<br> Anandi, come to the front.<br> Lead them.<br> Why are you following me?<br> What?<br> You were following me.<br> What does this mean?<br> In the dance,<br> you went from pataka...<br> which means the forest.<br> And then you did...<br> samputa...<br> which means<br> something that is hidden.<br> And after that, you did this.<br> And then you did chatura.<br> But at the very end,<br> you did this.<br> None of the other<br> dancers did that.<br> What did you mean? The god of<br> love is hiding in the forest?<br> No, that also means<br> the lotus flower.<br> Lotus flower<br> is hiding in the forest?<br> Why would a lotus flower<br> hide in the forest?<br> And this is Richard Parker.<br> He is the most<br> magnificent creature<br> we've ever had here.<br> Look at the way<br> he's turning his head.<br> Showing off. Like a dancer.<br> No, he heard something.<br> He's listening, you see?<br> We have talked<br> about it for some time.<br> Do you understand<br> what I'm saying?<br> Pi?<br> Sorry, you've been...<br> Worried.<br> For my family.<br> Our animals are worth far more<br> abroad than here in India.<br> And if the town council<br> stops supporting us...<br> I don't know where we will be.<br> So, it is what we have to do.<br> Do you understand?<br> I'm sorry,<br> what are we talking about?<br> We are leaving India.<br> What?<br> We are selling the zoo.<br> The zoo was never ours to sell.<br> The land belongs to the town.<br> But the animals are ours<br> and if we sell them...<br> we will have enough<br> to start a new life.<br> But where would we go?<br> Our life is here, Appa.<br> Canada.<br> I have some opportunities<br> for work in Winnipeg.<br> I'll be shipping most of the<br> animals for sale in North America.<br> We can get freighter passage<br> for the whole family.<br> So...<br> It is settled.<br> We will sail like Columbus.<br> But Columbus<br> was looking for India.<br> It takes<br> a lot of work to sell a zoo.<br> Before we left...<br> Anandi and I had time enough<br> to break each other's hearts.<br> Of course, I promised<br> I would come back one day.<br> It's funny.<br> I remember everything else<br> about our last day.<br> But I don't remember<br> saying goodbye.<br> Pi? They're<br> serving dinner below.<br> Piscine...<br> you have a whole life<br> ahead of you.<br> We are doing this<br> for you and Ravi.<br> Come inside<br> and have some dinner.<br> Vegetarian, please.<br> Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.<br> Do you have anything...<br> No, no, no.<br> Not more gravy.<br> You don't want gravy?<br> No.<br> No, I want something<br> vegetarian.<br> Oh.<br> Pas de problme.<br> She asked if you have<br> something vegetarian.<br> The cow that produced<br> this liver was vegetarian,<br> the pigs that went into<br> these sausages were vegetarian.<br> Very funny.<br> But my wife doesn't eat liver.<br> Pas de problme.<br> Then she can eat the sausage,<br> the rice, and the gravy.<br> Or you can cook your own food.<br> Haw dare you talk<br> to my wife like that?<br> Here's your rice.<br> I cook for sailors...<br> not curry-eaters.<br> What did you say?<br> Let go of me!<br> Who do you think you are?<br> You're nothing but a servant!<br> I feed people!<br> You feed monkeys!<br> Hello.<br> I am happy Buddhist.<br> So, I eat rice<br> next to gravy.<br> On ship, gravy is not meat.<br> Is taste.<br> You try?<br> Don't worry.<br> We will have plenty of fresh<br> supplies after we stop in Manila.<br> Why give Orange Juice<br> tranquilizers?<br> She's not going to<br> cause any trouble.<br> The stress of traveling<br> is not good for the animals...<br> and it helps<br> with the seasickness.<br> We don't want to be cleaning up<br> after a seasick orangutan...<br> do we?<br> My father was a businessman.<br> He had never tended<br> the animals himself.<br> I realized...<br> leaving India must have been<br> harder for him than it was for me.<br> So...<br> Have I forgotten anything?<br> I think you've set the stage.<br> So far, we have an Indian boy named<br> after a French swimming pool...<br> on a Japanese ship full of<br> animals, heading to Canada.<br> Yes.<br> Now, we have to send our boy into<br> the middle of the Pacific and...<br> And make me believe in God.<br> Yeah.<br> We'll get there.<br> It was four days<br> out of Manila...<br> above the Mariana Trench,<br> the deepest spot on Earth.<br> Our ship,<br> The Tsimtsum, pushed on,<br> bullishly indifferent<br> to its surroundings.<br> It moved with the slow, massive<br> confidence of a continent.<br> Ravi?<br> Did you hear that, Ravi?<br> I'm sleeping.<br> It's a thunderstorm.<br> Let's go watch.<br> Are you crazy?<br> We will get hit by lightning.<br> No, we won't. It will<br> hit the bridge first.<br> Don't tempt a storm, Pi.<br> Whoa.<br> Oh!<br> More rain! More rain!<br> Lord of Storms!<br> Whoa!<br> Lightning!<br> Ah!<br> Amma!<br> Appa!<br> Ravi! Get out! Get out!<br> Help me!<br> Help!<br> Get in the boat!<br> Please! Save my family!<br> Don't scare, okay?<br> Wait, stay here!<br> You have to help them!<br> Please!<br> Put this on.<br> No, no, my family!<br> Please!<br> We have to help them!<br> We don't have time.<br> My family's back there!<br> We help!<br> You must go!<br> Who let all the animals out?<br> You have to go now!<br> No, wait, my father!<br> He can't swim!<br> Go!<br> Hang on to the boat!<br> Hold, hold!<br> Bring it down!<br> Hey! You!<br> What are you doing?<br> Jump!<br> Hey, hey!<br> Hey! Over here!<br> Over here!<br> Richard Parker?<br> No! No!<br> No! Go away! Go away!<br> Agh!<br> Amma!<br> Appa! Ravi.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry!<br> Hari?<br> Looks as though your drugs<br> haven't worn off yet.<br> Orange Juice!<br> Orange Juice!<br> Welcome to Pi's Ark.<br> Where is your boy,<br> Orange Juice?<br> Don't worry, I bet mother<br> and father found him.<br> They'll all be here soon.<br> Hello!<br> Hello!<br> Anybody!<br> No!<br> Stop it! No!<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> No! No!<br> I'm sorry, Orange Juice.<br> I don't have any seasickness<br> medicine for you.<br> Supplies.<br> Oh, supplies!<br> Yes! Yes!<br> No! No!<br> No! No!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Come on!<br> Mmm.<br> My name is Pi Patel.<br> I have been in a shipwreck.<br> I am on a lifeboat alone...<br> with a tiger.<br> Please send help.<br> God, I give myself to you.<br> I am your vessel.<br> Whatever comes, I want to know.<br> Show me.<br> There are no lines.<br> Set your house in order and<br> dig in for the battle to survive.<br> Establish a strict<br> schedule for eating,<br> keeping watch and getting rest.<br> Do not drink<br> urine or sea water.<br> Keep busy but avoid<br> unnecessary exertion.<br> The mind can be kept occupied<br> by playing card games...<br> Twenty Questions, or! Spy.<br> Community singing is another<br> surefire way to lift the spirits.<br> Telling stories<br> is highly recommended.<br> Above all, don't lose hope.<br> Few things can sap the spirit<br> faster than seasickness.<br> Waves are most strongly felt when a<br> boat turns sideways to the current.<br> A sea anchor is used as a drag to<br> keep the boat's head to the wind.<br> Proper use of them<br> can increase control<br> and reduce seasickness<br> during rough seas.<br> For castaways who must share<br> their lifeboats with large,<br> dangerous carnivores...<br> it's advisable to establish<br> a territory as your own.<br> Try this method.<br> Step one.<br> Choose a day when waves are<br> moderate, but regular.<br> Step two. With the lifeboat<br> facing into the waves...<br> making the ride as comfortable as<br> possible, blow your whistle soothingly.<br> Step three. Turn the lifeboat<br> sideways to the waves...<br> accompanied by harsh,<br> aggressive use of the whistle.<br> With sufficient repetition...<br> the animal will associate<br> the sound of the whistle...<br> with the discomfort<br> of seasickness.<br> Similar methods have long been<br> used by circus trainers...<br> though they generally lack<br> access to rough seas.<br> Let the trumpets blare!<br> Let the drum rolls begin!<br> Prepare to be amazed!<br> Here it is, for your<br> enjoyment and instruction!<br> The show you've been waiting<br> for all your life...<br> will soon begin!<br> Are you ready for<br> the miracle of it?<br> Well, then, I give to you...<br> the astounding Bengal tiger!<br> Hello, Richard Parker.<br> Sorry about the choppy ride.<br> Mine! You understand?<br> Yours, mine!<br> You understand?<br> Ew!<br> Step four.<br> Disregard steps<br> one through three.<br> Here, Richard Parker.<br> I got some water for you.<br> In the zoo, we fed our tigers an<br> average of five kilos of meat a day.<br> Richard Parker<br> will be getting hungry soon.<br> Tigers are powerful swimmers,<br> and if he gets hungry enough...<br> I'm afraid the little<br> bit of water between us<br> won't be any protection.<br> I need to find a way<br> to feed him.<br> I can eat the biscuits but God<br> made tigers carnivores...<br> so I must learn to catch fish.<br> If I don't,<br> I'm afraid his last meal<br> will be a skinny,<br> vegetarian boy.<br> Patience!<br> What am I doing?<br> Wait! I'm thinking.<br> Thirty-two cartons<br> of biscuits.<br> Ninety-three cans of water.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Thank you, Lord Vishnu.<br> Thank you for coming in the form<br> of a fish and saving our lives.<br> Thank you.<br> Of course, I brought all<br> the biscuits and water<br> on the raft with me<br> to keep them safe.<br> Idiot.<br> Hunger can<br> change everything you<br> ever thought you<br> knew about yourself.<br> Here, it's yours!<br> Oh! Ah!<br> Mine! Mine!<br> I can't risk my life every time<br> I have to climb<br> onto the boat for supplies.<br> It's time to settle this.<br> If we're going<br> to live together,<br> we have to learn<br> to communicate.<br> Maybe Richard Parker<br> can't be tamed,<br> but with God's will,<br> he can be trained.<br> No!<br> Good.<br> Go, Richard Parker. Go.<br> Go on home,<br> I'll leave you alone.<br> I'll respect that, I promise.<br> Go. Come on.<br> Yes!<br> I never thought<br> a small piece of shade<br> could bring me<br> so much happiness.<br> That a pile of tools,<br> a bucket, a knife, a pencil...<br> might become my<br> greatest treasures.<br> Or that knowing Richard Parker was<br> here might ever bring me peace.<br> In times like these...<br> I remember that he has<br> as little experience<br> with the real world as I do.<br> We were both raised in a zoo<br> by the same master.<br> Now we've been orphaned, left to<br> face our ultimate master together.<br> Without Richard Parker,<br> I would have died by now.<br> My fear of him keeps me alert.<br> Tending to his needs<br> gives my life purpose.<br> Dolphins.<br> Hey, Richard Parker!<br> Hey!<br> Above all, don't lose hope.<br> Eight, five, five,<br> zero, three, six, six...<br> zero, eight, zero, one...<br> three, six, zero, four,<br> six, six, eight...<br> What are you looking at?<br> Talk to me.<br> Tell me what you see.<br> Words are all I have<br> left to hang on to.<br> Everything mixed up.<br> Fragmented.<br> Can't tell daydreams, night<br> dreams, from reality anymo...<br> Storm, Richard Parker.<br> No!<br> No!<br> Praise be to God!<br> Lord of all worlds!<br> The compassionate,<br> the merciful!<br> Ah!<br> Come out.<br> Richard Parker! Come out,<br> you have to see this!<br> It's beautiful!<br> Don't hide yourself!<br> He's come to us!<br> It's a miracle!<br> Come out and see God,<br> Richard Parker!<br> Why are you scaring him?<br> Oh, God!<br> I've lost my family!<br> I've lost everything!<br> I surrender!<br> What more do you want?<br> I'm sorry, Richard Parker.<br> We're dying, Richard Parker.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Amma, Appa, Ravi...<br> I'm happy I'm going<br> to see you soon.<br> Can you feel the rain?<br> God, thank you for<br> giving me my life.<br> I'm ready now.<br> Richard Parker?<br> Mmm.<br> Excuse me.<br> Move.<br> Move. Excuse me.<br> Hey! Hey!<br> Hey, come on!<br> Hey.<br> Hey, get away.<br> This is my bed.<br> It was a human tooth?<br> Don't you see? The<br> island was carnivorous.<br> Carnivorous?<br> Like a Venus Flytrap?<br> Yes, the whole island.<br> The plants, the water in those<br> pools, the very ground itself.<br> During the day, those<br> pools held fresh water.<br> But at night,<br> some chemical process<br> turned the water<br> in those pools into acid...<br> acid that dissolved<br> those fish...<br> that sent the meerkats<br> scurrying into the trees,<br> and Richard Parker<br> running to the boat.<br> But where did<br> the tooth come from?<br> Years ago, some poor fellow,<br> just like me...<br> must have found himself<br> stranded on that island...<br> and, like me, thought he<br> might stay there forever.<br> But all that the island gave him by<br> day, it took away again by night.<br> To think, how many hours spent<br> with only meerkats for company.<br> How much loneliness taken on.<br> All I know is that<br> eventually he died<br> and the island digested him...<br> leaving behind only his teeth.<br> I saw how my life would end<br> if I stayed on that island.<br> Alone and forgotten.<br> I had to get back to the<br> world, or die trying.<br> I spent the next day<br> preparing the boat.<br> I filled my stores<br> with fresh water...<br> ate seaweed until my stomach<br> could take no more...<br> and brought as many<br> meerkats as I could fit<br> into the storage locker<br> for Richard Parker.<br> I couldn't leave<br> without him, of course.<br> It would mean killing him.<br> And so,<br> I waited for his return.<br> I knew he wouldn't be late.<br> Richard Parker!<br> No one has seen that<br> floating island since.<br> And you won't read about those<br> trees in any nature book.<br> And yet, if I hadn't found those<br> shores, I would have died.<br> If I hadn't<br> discovered that tooth,<br> I would have been lost,<br> alone forever.<br> Even when God seemed<br> to have abandoned me...<br> He was watching.<br> Even when He seemed indifferent<br> to my suffering...<br> He was watching.<br> And when I was beyond all hope<br> of saving, He gave me rest...<br> then gave me a sign<br> to continue my journey.<br> By the time we reached<br> the Mexican shore,<br> I was afraid to<br> let go of the boat.<br> My strength was gone.<br> I was so weak.<br> I was afraid that in two feet of<br> water, so close to deliverance...<br> I would drown.<br> I struggled to shore<br> and fell upon the sand.<br> It was warm and soft...<br> like pressing my face<br> against the cheek of God.<br> And somewhere, two eyes were<br> smiling at having me there.<br> I was so spent,<br> I could hardly move.<br> And so, Richard Parker<br> went ahead of me.<br> He stretched his legs<br> and walked along the shore.<br> At the edge of the jungle,<br> he stopped.<br> I was certain he was going<br> to look back at me...<br> flatten his ears<br> to his head, growl.<br> That he would bring our<br> relationship to an end in some way.<br> But he just stared ahead<br> into the jungle.<br> And then, Richard Parker,<br> my fierce companion...<br> the terrible one<br> who kept me alive...<br> disappeared<br> forever from my life.<br> After a few hours, a member<br> of my own species found me.<br> He left and returned with a<br> group who carried me away.<br> I wept like a child.<br> Not because I was overwhelmed at<br> having survived, although I was.<br> I was weeping because Richard<br> Parker left me so unceremoniously.<br> It broke my heart.<br> You know, my father was right.<br> Richard Parker never<br> saw me as his friend.<br> After all we had been through,<br> he didn't even look back.<br> But I have to believe there<br> was more in his eyes...<br> than my own reflection<br> staring back at me.<br> I know it.<br> I felt it.<br> Even if I can't prove it.<br> You know,<br> I've left so much behind.<br> My family, the zoo,<br> India, Anandi.<br> I suppose, in the end, the whole of<br> life becomes an act of letting go.<br> But what always<br> hurts the most...<br> is not taking a moment<br> to say goodbye.<br> I was never able to thank my<br> father for all I learned from him.<br> To tell him,<br> without his lessons...<br> I would never have survived.<br> I know Richard Parker is a<br> tiger, but I wish I had said...<br> "It's over.<br> We survived."<br> "Thank you for saving my life.<br> I love you, Richard Parker."<br> "You will always<br> be with me."<br> "May God be with you."<br> I don't know what to say.<br> It's hard to believe, isn't it?<br> It is a lot to take in.<br> To figure out<br> what it all means.<br> If it happened, it happened.<br> Why should it have<br> to mean anything?<br> Some of it is<br> pretty incredible.<br> See, I was the only one<br> who survived the shipwreck.<br> So the Japanese shipping company<br> sent two men to talk to me...<br> in the Mexican hospital<br> where I was recovering.<br> I still have a copy<br> of their report.<br> They had insurance claims<br> to settle...<br> and they wanted to find out<br> why the ship sank.<br> They didn't believe me, either.<br> Thousands of meerkats on a<br> floating carnivorous island...<br> and no one has ever seen it?<br> Yes, just like I told you.<br> Bananas don't float.<br> Why are you<br> talking about bananas?<br> You said the orangutan floated<br> to you on a bundle of bananas.<br> But bananas don't float.<br> Are you sure about that?<br> Of course they do.<br> Try it for yourself.<br> In any case, we are not here to<br> talk about bananas or meerkats.<br> Look, Ive just told you along<br> story and I'm very tired.<br> We are here because a Japanese<br> cargo ship sank in the Pacific.<br> Something I never forget.<br> I lost my whole family.<br> Get him some water.<br> We don't mean to push you.<br> And you have our<br> deepest sympathies.<br> But we have come a long way...<br> and we are no closer to<br> understanding why the ship sank.<br> Because I don't know.<br> I was asleep.<br> Something woke me up.<br> It could have been an<br> explosion, I can't be sure.<br> And then the ship sank.<br> What else do you want from me?<br> A story that won't make us<br> look like fools.<br> We need a simpler story<br> for our report.<br> One our company can understand.<br> A story we can all believe.<br> So, a story without things<br> you've never seen before.<br> That's right.<br> Without surprises. Without<br> animals or islands.<br> Yes. The truth.<br> So, what did you do?<br> I told them another story.<br> Four of us survived.<br> The cook and the sailor<br> were already aboard.<br> The cook threw me a lifebuoy<br> and pulled me aboard...<br> and Mother held on to some bananas<br> and made it to the lifeboat.<br> The cook was a disgusting man.<br> He ate a rat.<br> We had food enough for weeks, but he<br> found the rat in the first few days...<br> and he killed it, dried<br> it in the sun and ate it.<br> He was such a brute, that man.<br> But he was resourceful.<br> It was his idea to build<br> the raft to catch fish.<br> We would have died in those<br> first few days without him.<br> The sailor was the same man who<br> brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.<br> We didn't understand much of what he<br> said, only that he was suffering.<br> He had broken his leg<br> horribly in the fall.<br> We tried to set it as best we could,<br> but the leg became infected...<br> and the cook said that we had<br> to do something or he'd die.<br> The cook said he'd do it,<br> but Mother and I had<br> to hold the man down.<br> And I believed him,<br> we needed to do it.<br> So...<br> I kept saying,<br> "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."<br> And he just kept looking at me.<br> His eyes were so...<br> I'll never understand the point<br> of that man's suffering.<br> I can still hear him.<br> The happy Buddhist,<br> he only ate rice and gravy.<br> We didn't save him, of course.<br> He died.<br> The morning after, the cook<br> caught his first dorado...<br> and I didn't understand what he had<br> done at first, but Mother did...<br> and I had never seen<br> Mother so angry.<br> "Stop whining and<br> be happy," he said.<br> "We need more food or we'll die.<br> That was the whole point."<br> "What was the whole point?"<br> Mother asked.<br> "You let that poor boy die in<br> order to get bait, you monster!"<br> The cook got furious.<br> He started towards her<br> with his fist raised...<br> and Mother slapped him hard,<br> right across the face.<br> I was stunned.<br> I thought he was going<br> to kill her right then.<br> But he didn't.<br> The cook didn't stop<br> at bait either, no.<br> The sailor...<br> He went the same<br> way the rat went.<br> The cook was a resourceful man.<br> It was a week later that he...<br> Because of me.<br> Because I couldn't<br> hold on to a stupid turtle.<br> It slipped out of my hands<br> and swam away.<br> And the cook came up and he punched<br> me on the side of my head...<br> and my teeth clacked<br> and I saw stars.<br> I thought he was<br> going to hit me again...<br> but Mother started pounding<br> on him with her fists...<br> screaming,<br> "Monster, monster!"<br> She yelled at me<br> to go to the raft.<br> I thought she was coming with<br> me, or I'd never have...<br> I don't know why I didn't<br> make her go first.<br> I think about that every day.<br> I jumped over and turned back<br> just as the knife came out.<br> There wasn't anything<br> I could do.<br> I couldn't look away.<br> He threw her body overboard.<br> And then the sharks came.<br> And I saw what they...<br> I saw.<br> The next day, I killed him.<br> He didn't even fight back. He<br> knew he had gone too far...<br> even by his own standards.<br> He'd left the knife<br> out on the bench,<br> and I did to him what<br> he did to the sailor.<br> He was such an evil man,<br> but worse still, he...<br> He brought the evil out in me.<br> And I have to live with that.<br> I was alone in a lifeboat...<br> drifting across<br> the Pacific Ocean.<br> And I survived.<br> After that, they<br> had no more questions.<br> The investigators didn't seem<br> to like the story, exactly.<br> But they thanked me, they<br> wished me well, and they left.<br> So the stories...<br> both the zebra<br> and the sailor...<br> broke their leg.<br> And the hyena killed the<br> zebra and the orangutan.<br> So... the hyena is the cook.<br> The sailor is the zebra.<br> Your mother is the orangutan.<br> And you are...<br> the tiger.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> Of course.<br> I've told you two stories about<br> what happened out on the ocean.<br> Neither explains what caused<br> the sinking of the ship...<br> and no one can prove which story<br> is true and which is not.<br> In both stories,<br> the ship sinks...<br> my family dies and I suffer.<br> True.<br> So, which story do you prefer?<br> The one with the tiger.<br> That's the better story.<br> Thank you.<br> And so it goes with God.<br> Mamaji was right.<br> It's an amazing story.<br> Will you really<br> let me write it?<br> Of course.<br> Isn't that why Mamaji<br> sent you here, after all?<br> My wife is here.<br> Do you want to stay for dinner?<br> She's an incredible cook.<br> I didn't know you had a wife.<br> And a cat and two children.<br> So, your story does<br> have a happy ending.<br> Well, that's up to you.<br> The story is yours now.<br> Hmm.<br> "Mr. Patel's is an astounding<br> story of courage and endurance...<br> unparalleled in the<br> history of shipwrecks."<br> "Very few castaways can claim to<br> have survived so long at sea...<br> and none in the company...<br> of an adult Bengal tiger."<br> Hi, Dad.<br> We have a guest.<br> Let me introduce you.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> Adita.<br> Ravi.<br>
