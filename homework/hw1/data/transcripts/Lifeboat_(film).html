                        Are you number two boat?<br> Faster.!<br> He was on number one last time I saw him.!<br> Ahoy there.!<br> Lady, you don't look like somebody<br> that's just been shipwrecked.<br> Man, I certainly feel like it.<br> Did you see anything<br> of Charcoal?<br> - Who?<br> - Joe, the steward.<br> He helped me<br> into the lifeboat with my things.<br> I thought this boat<br> was abandoned.<br> Not by me, it wasn't.<br> It looked pretty good to me.<br> What part of the ship<br> are you from, darling?<br> Engine room.<br> I was off duty in the washroom.<br> Thanks.<br> Caught with my...<br> I was washing my hands<br> when the torpedo smacked us.<br> Most of the crew<br> were trapped like rats.<br> - When they got to topside, it was a shambles.<br> - Quite a night.<br> Reminds me of an air raid once<br> that hit me in Chungking.<br> Reminded me of a slaughterhouse<br> I once worked at in Chicago.<br> Those Nazi buzzards in tin fish ain't<br> enough. They've got to shell us too.<br> Ha. Now I can perfect my backhand.<br> Get that.<br> It might come in handy.<br> Let's have the cap too.<br> What are we worryin'<br> about this junk for?<br> Let's take a look for the others before<br> that U-boat surfaces again and sees us.<br> - She won't surface. One of our shells got her.<br> - Are you sure?<br> She was killed dead, darling.<br> Went down like a rock.<br> Did you see it?<br> It's all in here, my pet.<br> You're Constance Porter.<br> I heard you were aboard.<br> - So you took pictures?<br> - And what pictures! Priceless!<br> Oh, I caught some<br> wonderful shots on deck.<br> A little knot of people<br> around one of the lifeboats.<br> They look slow and heavy and fat<br> with the life belts on, so lonesome.<br> Then a shell hit the lifeboat.<br> They all jumped overboard.<br> I got a beautiful shot of the gun crew<br> firing at the submarine.<br> But the best of all was in the boat,<br> here, with Joe.<br> I got the freighter going down, one of the<br> lifeboats caught in the suction and pulled under!<br> I got some of the U-boat crew<br> jumping overboard and I also got...<br> Look!<br> That's a perfect touch!<br> What did you do that for?<br> Why don't you wait for the baby<br> to float by and photograph that?<br> Help.!<br> Gangway!<br> You stupid, clumsy, son-of-a...<br> Why don't you<br> look where you're going?<br> Absolutely irreplaceable stuff.<br> Priceless. The best film I ever took.!<br> - Goes to the bottom of the sea.<br> - That's better than going there yourself!<br> I wouldn't have parted with that film<br> for a million dollars.<br> When will I ever get stuff like that<br> again? Of all the stupid, clumsy...<br> Maybe we can arrange another shipwreck<br> for you sometime.<br> Sparks, did you have time<br> to send out an S.O.S.?<br> Hardly. The first shell from the U-boat<br> did for the radio shack.<br> Keep going, Kovac.<br> There's more people out there.<br> - Where'd this come from?<br> - It was floating by.<br> Miss MacKenzie!<br> - Stanley.!<br> - She's out there.<br> She's alive.<br> Come on, Kovac. Come on.<br> There's somebody, out there.<br> To your right, Kovac.<br> - There's three of them!<br> - Swing over, Kovac.<br> - Hurry, we've got a wounded man!<br> - Step on it!<br> - A dame!<br> - Never mind me. Help him. He's hurt his leg.<br> - Well, hang on, Miss.<br> - Well, folks, we're in business again.<br> - Somebody gonna give me a hand?<br> - Ritt.<br> - You old rat.<br> - Connie!<br> Did you come from the freighter<br> or the Stork Club?<br> - Still striking oil, I see, eh, Ritt?<br> - Anybody got any liquor?<br> I'll have this off you in a jiffy.<br> I'm okay, Sparks.<br> What happened to Nolan?<br> I was on my way from the bridge<br> to bring him our position...<br> a shell from the U-boat<br> hit the radio shack.<br> I was at the wheel waitin'<br> for Hennessy to relieve me.<br> Just set the mug up with<br> some hot java when...<br> Holy smokes, look at this mess.<br> Maybe we'd better<br> get the raft back.<br> - Do you think we'll stay afloat?<br> - If the buoyancy tanks are okay, she'll float...<br> even if we're waterlogged.<br> Well, I see you've even managed<br> to get some of your luggage aboard.<br> - Just the bare necessities.<br> - Uh, look at that.<br> Six full boxes, and<br> I had to grab this one.<br> Don't cry, my pet.<br> It'll last until we're picked up. I hope.<br> - First shell must have done for the skipper.<br> - And most of the gun crew.<br> What happened to the woman<br> with the baby?<br> See if you can<br> find a first-aid kit.<br> I thought everybody was killed.<br> I never expected to see you alive.<br> You know I'm practically<br> immortal, Ritt.<br> l... I thought I was done for. See,<br> we were playing poker in the saloon...<br> Now, how do you get this thing off?<br> Here's the first-aid kit.<br> It's been pretty well smashed up.<br> Oh. I need something<br> to cover him up with.<br> Let me have that blanket, please.<br> Bandages, please.<br> Well, share and share<br> alike, I always say.<br> - Lie down, please.<br> - What for?<br> You'll be more comfortable.<br> I wanna take a look at your leg.<br> Oh, well, okay, babe. Maybe you'll<br> let me return the compliment someday.<br> - Shh. Lie down, please.<br> - I think it's got a hunk of slug in it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> It was the biggest pot of the game...<br> but believe you me, I never<br> even stopped to collect it.<br> - That pot went to DavyJones.<br> - Well, not all of it.<br> - Here's 20 bucks Mr. Jones didn't get.<br> - Well, it's yours.<br> - It was floating in the water.<br> - Well, keep it.<br> No, go on. I insist.<br> It's probably legitimate as salvage.<br> - You one of the crew, son?<br> - Black gang. Oiler. Name's Kovac.<br> - Kovac, eh? My name's Rittenhouse.<br> - Glad to...<br> - Rittenhouse?<br> - That's right.<br> - C.J. Rittenhouse?<br> - C.J. Rittenhouse.<br> - Junior.<br> - Here.<br> - Are you sure there's no sulfanilamide left in the kit?<br> - 'Fraid not.<br> - Hurt?<br> - No.<br> Here's the shrapnel. Thought you might<br> like to keep it as a souvenir.<br> Nah. My hide was<br> full of that stuff on the last trip.<br> - Hold it steady.<br> - I oughta have my head examined.<br> This is the fourth time I've shipped out<br> since the war, and I ain't got no place yet.<br> Gee, I wish I could make<br> the complete round-trip just once.<br> - How does it look?<br> - It's a pretty deep cut.<br> It's leakin'. I ain't gonna wind up<br> with a gimpy leg, am I?<br> No. Not enough to interfere<br> with your jitterbugging.<br> - Jive, huh?<br> - Eh, tell her, Sparks.<br> Why he's the champion hoofer<br> of the merchant marines.<br> Tell her what I done<br> in Jersey City.<br> Listen, I copped two prizes<br> at Roseland one year...<br> and all the time, I'm suffering somethin'<br> terrible from double pneumonia.<br> I can out-jive the rest of those hepcats<br> even with a bum gam.<br> Everything under control?<br> Anything I can do?<br> You ain't got somethin'<br> to drink on ya?<br> - Sorry, son. Not a drop.<br> - I have some brandy, darling.<br> Oh, boy. I could sure go<br> for some of that.<br> - I'll get my flask.<br> - No. In a case like this, the rule is to...<br> Come on.<br> We're among friends, ain't we?<br> - I don't think it's advisable.<br> - Look. Just one slug. It'll pick me up.<br> - Make up your minds, darlings.<br> - Help.!<br> Help!<br> - Help.!<br> - It's Charcoal!<br> It's the steward.!<br> - There's a woman.<br> - And a baby.<br> Easy there.<br> Give me the baby.<br> Are you all right, Joe?<br> I got my feet wet<br> a little bit.<br> She was fightin' me<br> all the time in the water.<br> She tried to drown the baby<br> and herself with it.<br> Huh, it's all right,<br> sister. You're safe.<br> The baby's safe.<br> It's all right. The danger's over.<br> You're safe now.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> Best let her have it.<br> We'll wait till she's asleep.<br> Here.<br> Hey. That's right.<br> Her name's Higley. She was<br> bombed out in Bristol.<br> One of them shell shock cases sent to<br> America. Her child was born in New York.<br> Said to me on the ship, "I'm going home<br> to show my husband the baby."<br> Here, darling.<br> You better put this on.<br> Hey, look. Another customer.<br> - Where'd he come from?<br> - Is he a crew member?<br> - I never saw him before.<br> - Not off our boat.<br> Danke schn.<br> He's very grateful to us<br> for having saved his life.<br> Regrets very much the U-boat<br> was compelled to sink our ship.<br> Ask him why they shelled our lifeboats.<br> - Captain's orders.<br> - If you ask me, he's the captain himself.<br> Ask him if he's the captain.<br> He says he's not a captain or<br> officer, just a crew member.<br> Well, crew member<br> or skipper, he's German.<br> A guy can't help bein' German<br> if he's born a German, can he?<br> Neither can a snake help being<br> a rattlesnake if he's born a rattlesnake.<br> That don't make him a nightingale.<br> Get him outta here.<br> Don't be silly, darling. He can't very well<br> get off in the middle of the ocean, can he?<br> - Throw him off.<br> - Have you gone out of your mind?<br> - Throw the Nazi buzzard overboard!<br> - That's out of the question!<br> - It's against the law.<br> - Whose law? We're on our own. We can make our own law!<br> Now, just a minute.<br> He was acting under orders.<br> Our freighter was an enemy ship.<br> After all, we're at war!<br> Is that woman at war?<br> Is her baby at war?<br> And listen, how come<br> you know the lingo so well?<br> How come when I climbed into this<br> life boat you were the only one in it...<br> dressed up like you knew<br> you were going someplace?<br> I was going someplace.<br> I was going into a lifeboat.<br> What is this?<br> Are you insinuating?<br> - You seem pretty anxious to stand up for your friend here.<br> - What do you mean, my friend?<br> Now, children,<br> let's keep our shirts on.<br> I haven't got a shirt<br> or a mink coat either.<br> Oh, I get it.<br> A fellow traveler.<br> I thought the Comintern was dissolved.<br> Now, we're all sort of fellow travelers, in<br> a mighty small boat, on a mighty big ocean.<br> And the more we quarrel and criticize<br> and misunderstand each other...<br> the bigger the ocean gets,<br> and the smaller the boat.<br> The boat's too small<br> for me and this German.<br> Me, I'm perfectly willing to abide<br> by the decision of the majority.<br> That's the American way.<br> If we harm this man, we are guilty<br> of the same tactics you hate him for.<br> On the other hand, if we treat him<br> with kindness and consideration...<br> we might be able to convert him<br> to our way of thinking.<br> That's the, uh...<br> That's the Christian way.<br> Okay. Now, me, I'm American too.<br> I was born one in Chicago.<br> But my people are from Czechoslovakia.<br> Ever hear of that place?<br> I say let's throw him overboard<br> and watch him drown.<br> When he goes down, I'll dance a jig<br> like Hitler did when France went down.<br> Me, too.<br> Just for the record,<br> I'm an American, myself.<br> I'm in a kind of a spot.<br> My name is Schmidt,<br> but I changed it to Smith.<br> That's what I got against these guys<br> more than anything else.<br> They make me ashamed of<br> the name I was born with.<br> I got a lot of relatives in Germany.<br> For all I know this guy may be one of them.<br> I say throw him to the sharks.<br> No, Gus. I don't say it wouldn't be a pleasure,<br> mind you, but we haven't got the right.<br> The right?<br> What do you mean the right?<br> Well, he's a prisoner of war.<br> Got to be treated as such.<br> The way it's done is to hang on<br> to him till we're picked up...<br> then turn him over<br> to proper authorities.<br> Till such time, we represent<br> the authorities. That's clear, isn't it?<br> - You see what I mean, miss?<br> - I don't understand any of it.<br> I don't understand people hurting<br> each other and killing each other.<br> I just don't understand it.<br> - Then what are you doing in a uniform?<br> - I'm doing the only thing I can.<br> Trying to put them together again<br> when they get hurt.<br> As far as the German's concerned, l...<br> I agree with Stanley.<br> So do I. I'll talk to the man. Maybe<br> I can get some information from him.<br> - Material for your book?<br> - Incidentally.<br> - George?<br> - What do you say, Joe?<br> - Do I get to vote too?<br> - Why... Why certainly!<br> Guess I'd rather<br> stay out of this.<br> How about you, sister?<br> My baby's dead.<br> Does anyone know the service<br> for burial at sea?<br> Well, I, uh... I suppose<br> any prayer would do.<br> Let me see, now.<br> The Lord is my shepherd.<br> Uh, I shall not want.<br> He maketh me to lie down<br> in green pastures. He, uh... He, uh...<br> He leadeth me beside<br> the still waters.<br> He restoreth my soul.<br> He leadeth me in the paths<br> of righteousness, for His name's sake.<br> Yea, though I walk through the valley<br> of the shadow of death...<br> I will fear no evil.<br> For thou art with me. Thy rod<br> and thy staff, they comfort me.<br> Surely goodness and mercy<br> shall follow me all the days of my life.<br> And I will dwell in<br> the house of the Lord...<br> forever.<br> Amen.<br> Well, I don't know how much<br> of this stuff is any use to us.<br> Isn't much we can do with<br> these food compartments.<br> Well, at any rate, things<br> are getting shipshape.<br> None of the buoyancy tanks<br> seem to have been smashed.<br> The water breaker's been taped up, and in<br> the morning we'll rig up a sail and get going.<br> And in the meantime, I think<br> we'd all better try and get some sleep.<br> Uh, Kovac, don't forget<br> to wake me for my watch.<br> We'd better send up<br> another flare soon.<br> How do you feel, darling?<br> Better, thank you.<br> Much better.<br> - Have I been asleep long?<br> - Not very.<br> - What's this?<br> - Mrs. Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm.<br> It's a beautiful coat.<br> - Is it real mink?<br> - I hope so.<br> It's lovely.<br> I've always admired mink.<br> It's the most ladylike fur<br> there is, I always said.<br> So warm and comfortable.<br> Thank you so much<br> for letting me wear it.<br> Where's Johnny?<br> Where's my baby?<br> What have you done with him?<br> What did you do<br> with my baby?<br> Your baby's dead.<br> Don't you remember?<br> You killed him, didn't you?<br> Poor little thing.<br> The sea, so big and terrible.<br> Johnny, it's Mum.<br> Where are you?<br> Where are you, Johnny?<br> Johnny.<br> Let me go.<br> Let me go to him.<br> Get a rope, somebody.<br> We've got to tie her down.<br> Here you are.<br> Let me go to him.<br> Let me go.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Hmm? Oh!<br> Good morning, Sparks. Asleep on watch. It's<br> a fine thing. I oughta be court-martialed.<br> - I wonder how much we've drifted.<br> - Not very far with that sea-anchor out.<br> Oh, the sea-anchor, of course. You know,<br> I had no idea what those things looked like.<br> I thought they were big, heavy iron things<br> with a hook to hold us onto the sea bottom.<br> When you threw that thing out, I thought it<br> was some sort of a toy parachute or something.<br> They really keep the boat from drifting?<br> Last time I was adrift, a sea anchor<br> held us up 48 hours in a storm.<br> - You've been torpedoed before?<br> - That's right, twice.<br> - How long before you were picked up?<br> - Last time, it was 43 days.<br> Forty-three...<br> That must have been awful!<br> Yeah. We did<br> get a bit sunburned.<br> Then, of course, we had a good sound boat,<br> plenty of food and water. Everything intact.<br> - Well, haven't we plenty too?<br> - A good deal of our food's been ruined.<br> Three out of the four water breakers<br> have been smashed.<br> A lot of water leaked out of<br> the fourth one before it was taped.<br> What worries me is the compass.<br> Knocked to pieces.<br> That's a bit awkward.<br> And, of course, there's Jerry.<br> Ah, good morning, Mrs. Porter.<br> What's good about it?<br> How soon do we get picked up?<br> Good morning, Connie. We were discussing<br> that. It seems there's no way of telling.<br> - Did you sleep well?<br> - Not a wink.<br> Not only that, I froze.<br> Only had my fur coat to keep me... warm.<br> Where's Miss Higley?<br> I'm sorry, folks.<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> It was pitch black<br> when I relieved you, Kovac.<br> I couldn't see a thing.<br> For all I know, it might have happened<br> during your watch.<br> - Eight biscuits.<br> - Minus eight biscuits.<br> Oh, thanks. Kovac.<br> How's the sail coming along?<br> - Coming along.<br> - Light, sir?<br> Uh, no, thanks. I think I'll hoard<br> this heater till we get someplace.<br> Well, folks, I've been taking inventory,<br> and we're in the black.<br> A going concern. It's no use<br> lying around waiting to be picked up.<br> As we might have to wait as long as,<br> uh... as 43 days.<br> So we might as well get organized. The first<br> order of business is department heads.<br> - Uh, Sparks?<br> - Yes, Mr. Rittenhouse.<br> - Call me Ritt. We're all in the same boat.<br> - Yes, sir. Ritt.<br> Sparks, you are, uh,<br> in charge of navigation.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Uh, George?<br> Call meJoe.<br> - Is your nameJoe?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Very well. Joe it is.<br> You are head of the commissary.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Connie, will you keep the ship's log, please?<br> Righto, Ritto, providing I control<br> the copyright and all publication rights.<br> Including the Scandinavian.<br> Yes. Miss MacKenzie.<br> You are in charge of sick bay.<br> Don't look now, but<br> I think we have a skipper.<br> - Who elected Mr. Rittenhouse?<br> - Mr. Rittenhouse.<br> - Ritt, to you.<br> - You think he's capable?<br> Sure. Till the sail goes up.<br> We never should've<br> let him stay on board.<br> He'll eat our food, drink our water,<br> and double-cross us, first chance he gets.<br> What are you afraid of?<br> He's one against seven.<br> It was eight yesterday.<br> Or have you forgotten?<br> There's a piece in here...<br> about some people who were adrift<br> in a lifeboat for 80 days.<br> Say, maybe<br> we can beat that record.<br> Heaven forbid.<br> We might even get in the newsreels.<br> Rosie'd get a bang outta that.<br> It'd remind her of the first cup we won<br> at the Garden for marathon dancing.<br> - We danced 80 consecutive hours.<br> - Consecutive?<br> Well, 10 minutes off every four hours<br> for coffee, cake, stuff like that.<br> So how'd you feel<br> after 80 hours of dancing?<br> I had a slight headache,<br> but Rosie, she was just gettin' wound up.<br> She grabbed a cab,<br> went right over to Roseland.<br> - Does she work there?<br> - She lives there.<br> - How does the leg feel now?<br> - It don't feel at all.<br> I wish I could walk around. I sure hope<br> that thing don't leave me gimpy.<br> - Al'd love that.<br> - Who's Al?<br> Al Magaroulian.<br> He's an Armenian rug-cutter.<br> He knew Rosie before I did.<br> He's got fallen arches.<br> Keeps him outta the draft,<br> but not outta Roseland.<br> Kovac, you know something<br> about machinery, don't you?<br> - A little.<br> - See if you can fix this clasp.<br> Mrs. Porter, I've read a lot of your stuff.<br> You wanna know what's the matter with it?<br> No, do tell me.<br> You've been all over the world.<br> You've met all kinds of people.<br> But you never write about them,<br> you only write about yourself.<br> You think this whole war's a show put on<br> for you to cover, like a Broadway play.<br> And if enough people die before the last<br> act, maybe you might give it four stars.<br> - Come on, Sparks.<br> - All right, tovarich. Now, listen to me.<br> Heads up.! Joe, man the tiller<br> till we're squared away.!<br> Well, folks, we're under way.<br> - Where to?<br> - Huh?<br> - Where are we going?<br> - First operator said we were headed for Bermuda.<br> Well, good. Uh, Sparks,<br> you better take the tiller.<br> Yes, sir. Uh, what about the course?<br> Does anybody here know<br> the course to Bermuda?<br> I was at the wheel when we got punctured.<br> The course was 115 east-southeast.<br> Fine, then,<br> east-southeast it is.<br> Yes, sir. But, uh,<br> what is east-southeast?<br> - Without a compass...<br> - What's the matter with the sun?<br> With the sun this high, it's pretty hard<br> to tell the points of the compass.<br> I think it's out that way.<br> - You think?<br> - Doesn't anybody know?<br> He says east-southeast<br> is that direction.<br> - How's he know?<br> - Well, he ought to know.<br> His U-boat was operating<br> around here, wasn't it?<br> Do you suppose he'd lead us<br> to Bermuda, British territory?<br> He says he'd rather be a prisoner of war<br> in Bermuda than here.<br> At least he'd have<br> good food and a bed.<br> I wouldn't trust anything he says.<br> Kovac, you're so prejudiced<br> you can't think straight.<br> If anybody's in the position to know where<br> we are and where Bermuda is, he's the one.<br> - Who says so?<br> - We'll follow the German's course.<br> Who elected you skipper?<br> Well, l... Course, if there's anybody<br> else you'd prefer...<br> What do you<br> know about a ship?<br> He just happens to own<br> a shipyard, that's all.<br> - Has he ever been in it?<br> - He has thousands of employees.<br> Of course he knows<br> how to handle men.<br> Not in a lifeboat. What we need is<br> an able seaman, and we've got one.<br> Who, me?<br> I'm a disabled seaman.<br> Anyhow, I never did have<br> no executive ability.<br> - I think maybe Sparks there...<br> - No, not me.<br> I know a bit about navigation, but when it<br> comes to taking charge of a boat, well...<br> What about Kovac?<br> That clunk run this boat?<br> With what? An oil can?<br> If you're talking about a skipper,<br> we have a skipper right on this boat.<br> - He wasn't the captain.<br> - Wasn't he?<br> - Herr Kapitn?<br> - Ja?<br> Well, I'm a monkey's uncle!<br> There. You have a man who's<br> familiar with these waters.<br> He knows seamanship and navigation.<br> What about it?<br> You want to turn the boat over to the man<br> who sunk our ship and shelled our lifeboats?<br> I want you to turn the boat over to the man<br> obviously best qualified to run it.<br> - You're crazy.<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> There are two sides to everything.<br> Let's look at this calmly and reasonably.<br> The gentleman is just as anxious<br> to get to safety as we are.<br> If he's a trained skipper,<br> why shouldn't he take charge?<br> - Because I'm taking charge!<br> - Since when?<br> As of now, I'm skipper. Anybody who don't<br> like it can get out and swim to Bermuda.<br> I'll buy it.<br> Suits me.<br> What about you, miss?<br> I'm for it.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Well, if the rest agree...<br> All right, Commissar,<br> what's the course?<br> Well, we...<br> - Which way'd you say, Sparks?<br> - Out there.<br> Nein, nein.<br> He says if you go your way,<br> you'll only head further out to sea.<br> He insists the course<br> to Bermuda is that way.<br> - We'll head this way. Take the tiller, Sparks.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Careful.<br> Including the Scandinavian.<br> - How do you feel now, Connie?<br> - Awful.<br> It isn't the sea that makes me sick,<br> it's the loss of my typewriter.<br> That typewriter went with me everywhere...<br> Rome, Berlin, Paris, London.<br> Oh, quit grousing.<br> Why shouldn't I grouse? Little by little, I'm<br> being stripped of all my earthly possessions.<br> First, my beautiful stocking,<br> then my camera.<br> I don't mind the loss of the camera<br> so much, but the film in it!<br> I get positively ill<br> when I think about it.<br> Hey, do you remember the boom<br> we had after the last war?<br> Well, the boom we're gonna have after this<br> one'll make the last look like a mild flurry.<br> Then my steamer rug goes, then my fur coat,<br> and now my typewriter.<br> Take China, for example.<br> 400 million customers waiting to sign on<br> the dotted line as soon as peace is declared.<br> I never should've taken<br> the freighter, should've gone by clipper.<br> Me, too. I'd have been<br> in Spain by this time.<br> Spain? Were you going<br> for the state department?<br> State department? Certainly not.<br> I was going for C.J. Rittenhouse.<br> - What for?<br> - What for? Why, my dear fellow.<br> Pipe down, Ritt.<br> The "Gay-Pay-oo."<br> What are you doing<br> with my memo pad?<br> I borrowed it from you<br> to make a deck of cards.<br> Never heard such impertinence,<br> opening my bag.<br> It was open.<br> How about a little draw poker?<br> - Eh, suits me fine!<br> - Deal you in?<br> With a deck<br> you've made, darling?<br> What are you gonna play for?<br> - Dollar limit?<br> - That'll do for a starter.<br> - Cut for deal.<br> - All right.<br> You deal.<br> What are those letters<br> on your diaphragm?<br> - Love letters.<br> - Oh, you believe in advertising?<br> Open.<br> Never could understand this quaint habit<br> of making a billboard out of one's torso.<br> - Stay.<br> - Three cards.<br> I must say you've shown the most commendable<br> delicacy in just tattooing the initial...<br> not printing the names, addresses,<br> and telephone numbers.<br> Open.<br> - Nines?<br> - Queens.<br> See, how many are there?<br> One, two, three, four, five.<br> - Remind me to show you the rest of them sometime.<br> - Your deal, my boy.<br> And see you deal them<br> off the top.<br> - You mean, you're used to people dealing off the bottom?<br> - I was justjoking.<br> I never thought I'd go into it.<br> I used to faint at the sight of blood.<br> What made you join<br> the merchant marine?<br> I don't know.<br> Never thought about it.<br> I suppose it was<br> 'cause I lived in Greenwich.<br> Maybe it was the river<br> there, and the ships.<br> It's the first time I've ever been to sea.<br> I was born and raised in the wheat country.<br> You know, sometimes when the wind blows through<br> the wheat, it looks something like the sea.<br> Well, it's not a bad life, the merchant<br> marine, except for the U-boats.<br> After a while, you get to taking even<br> them in your stride.<br> It's rather scary the first<br> time, though, isn't it?<br> I'm glad the freighter<br> was torpedoed.<br> My dear young lady,<br> what an extraordinary thing to say!<br> - What are you doing that for?<br> - It's the bandage, Loot, it's too tight or something.<br> Oh, wait. Let me.<br> Holy mackerel.<br> - Ain't it a lulu?<br> - What about it, Miss?<br> - I don't know. I'm afraid it...<br> - Looks more like a leg oflamb, don't it?<br> Get away from here.<br> Tell him to get back to his place<br> before I throw him overboard.<br> What did he say?<br> Gus, I'm afraid<br> your leg's very bad.<br> Gangrene?<br> Ja, gangrene.<br> It'll have to be<br> amputated at once.<br> I've never even assisted<br> in an amputation.<br> He says, being an enemy and,<br> technically, our prisoner...<br> perhaps you wouldn't want to trust him with<br> the operation, but he's willing to do it.<br> What the devil<br> does he know about it?<br> He says he was a surgeon in civilian life.<br> He's done many operations.<br> If he did, they were probably illegal. If he's<br> a medical man, why isn't he in medical service?<br> I don't know and I don't care.<br> Perhaps the gangrene<br> isn't legal, either, but it's there.<br> The leg has to come off.<br> No dice.<br> I don't want no operation.<br> - Darling, you want to live, don't you?<br> - Not with one leg.<br> - Don't be a sap, Gus.<br> - You don't understand.<br> - Sure, I do. Rosie.<br> - What's Rosie got to do with it?<br> - Everything. If I lose my leg, I lose Rosie.<br> - Of course, I don't know Rosie.<br> She loves to dance. It's her hobby.<br> It's her whole life.<br> - Put yourself in her place. Do you like to dance?<br> - Mad about it.<br> Well, then, what good's a hepcat with one<br> gam missin'? If my leg goes, Rosie goes.<br> - If she's that kind of a...<br> - Don't you call Rosie that kind of a...<br> I oughta know. I introduced<br> you to her, didn't I?<br> No, you didn't. Al Magaroulian<br> introduced me to her.<br> - I knew her before Al Magaroulian did.<br> - Al Magaroulian...<br> The heck with Al Magaroulian.<br> What's he got to do with it?<br> - Rosie's as good as anybody.<br> - And a darn sight better.<br> - If she was the right kind of a woman...<br> - Kovac, you take that back.<br> Darling, don't you pay any attention<br> to this human 24-sheet.<br> Now, you listen to me.<br> I don't know Rosie, but I know women.<br> Some of my best friends are women.<br> And one of'em's "that kind of a..."<br> - What kind of a?<br> - Well, an independent creature who lives her own life.<br> - That's Rosie all over.<br> - With a heart of gold. And she gives it away.<br> Rosie'd give the shirt off her back to anybody.<br> She's got a heart as big as her head.<br> - And you wanna break it.<br> - Who, me?<br> Well, you'd rather die<br> than trust her.<br> Who says I don't trust her?<br> It's Al Magaroulian I don't trust.<br> He knew her before I did.<br> She swore to me there was<br> nothing between them, but...<br> Maybe there wasn't.<br> But Rosie's human like everybody else...<br> and it ain't like we was married,<br> or had a home and all.<br> Maybe we shoulda got hitched<br> before I left on that last trip.<br> I shoulda took care<br> of that insurance.<br> Rosie kept askin' me about it.<br> The kid's always thinkin' of me.<br> That's why you've got to think of her,<br> back home, putting on a big show...<br> laughing and dancing, pretending<br> to be having a good time.<br> And all the while, her heart's aching,<br> torn with loneliness and uncertainty.<br> Not knowing whether<br> you're dead or alive.<br> Then, at last, to find out<br> that you risked your life...<br> perhaps even died, just<br> because you had no faith in her?<br> God, forgive me.<br> Poor kid, she'd be<br> brokenhearted when she...<br> Well, let's go.<br> What are we all waitin' for?<br> He'll need a pail of water, Joe.<br> - Is there any sort of anesthetic?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nein.<br> - You have some brandy, haven't you?<br> He says brandy's better than nothing.<br> Did I hear brandy?<br> - Let me get it for you.<br> - Oh, thanks, Joe.<br> Can you open it for me?<br> That's right, it's just here.<br> - Here, darling.<br> - Hi-yo, Silver!<br> He'll need a tourniquet, a belt or something.<br> I'll lose my pants if I take mine off.<br> - How 'bout your belt, Sparks?<br> - Here it is.<br> - Get it, Joe.<br> - It was nice knowin' ya.<br> Um, oh, Joe. He wants a needle and twine<br> from the, uh, boat kit or something.<br> It's in a ditty bag, Joe.<br> Aah!<br> Am I gonna feel good<br> pretty soon.<br> Kovac, why'd you want to<br> say that about Rosie?<br> - Say what?<br> - What you said.<br> - I'm sorry, Gus.<br> - Take it back.<br> Okay, I take it back.<br> - What can we use for forceps?<br> - You have tweezers?<br> I've got tweezers. Yes, Joe,<br> you'll find them in my bag.<br> - The little box on the top.<br> - Right.<br> Ask him how much of<br> that stuff he can drink.<br> Go ahead, Gus. The works.<br> Down the hatch.<br> I'll never forget you.<br> Joe, clear away<br> some of that stuff.<br> We'll lay him out here. We'll need<br> something for weights to hold it down.<br> Kovac...<br> you know what I think of that no-good,<br> snake-in-the-grass friend of yours, Al Magaroulian?<br> Magaroulian's no friend of mine.<br> Magaroulian's a skunk.<br> Two-legged skunk.<br> - I hate his guts.<br> - You're okay, pal.<br> Hi, Loot.<br> Hiya, Gus.<br> Well, anyway, it's an experience.<br> I oughta have my head examined.<br> I didn't have to go to sea.<br> I coulda got a job in a defense plant<br> making good dough.<br> I coulda joined the army,<br> or even the navy.<br> 'Stead of that, I got assigned<br> on a stinking ol' rust bucket.<br> Mr. Rittenhouse?<br> Yes, son?<br> Call me Gus.<br> Hiya, babe.<br> - Hi, toots.<br> - Give us a kiss, will ya?<br> Hey, Joe.<br> What'd ya stop playin' for?<br> Come on. Give us a little music.<br> No, no. None of that slicker music. Come on.<br> Come on. Boogie it up. Boogie it up.<br> - Tell him to hold the boat<br> as steady as possible.<br> - Steady as you go, Sparks.<br> - Righto.<br> Saying a thing like that. Just because<br> she likes to dance and have a good time.<br> Nobody's gonna call Rosie...<br> Hey, Kovac.<br> You're a no-good heel.<br> Take his backrest away.<br> All right.<br> Look alive now, Sparks.<br> Righto.<br> Bring more bandages.<br> Joe.<br> Mr. Kovac.<br> Keep her steady, you fool!<br> Open.<br> - Stay.<br> - Three cards.<br> Bet one.<br> Call. Nines.<br> Queens.<br> - Give 'em a good shuffle.<br> - Okay, cut 'em.<br> Fill another inside straight,<br> I'll cut your throat.!<br> It's lucky for Gus we had somebody aboard<br> who knew how to meet an emergency like this.<br> Two more cards, darling.<br> You know, by golly,<br> the thing that got me...<br> Play cards, Ritt.<br> Say, what are you two<br> gabbing about?<br> Currents. Not the pie kind,<br> darling, the ocean kind.<br> Fascinating subject, currents.<br> They're either for you or agin you.<br> Connie, darling, do you stay<br> or do you pass?<br> Ritt, darling,<br> I've already stayed.<br> - Yeah, well, it'll cost you two bucks more.<br> - Oh.<br> Connie!<br> - Hold your horses, darling. I'm in a conference.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Women and poker!<br> I'll stay. Fortunately, Kapitn seems to think<br> we're on a favoring current, quite swift.<br> - We got a favoring breeze, too.<br> - Good. Then we ought to be in Bermuda in no time.<br> - I hope so, for Gus's sake.<br> - That is, if we're on the right course.<br> - Well, does he still think we're not?<br> - He didn't say anything about it.<br> Well, ask him.<br> One can't be sure without a compass.<br> He was pretty certain<br> a few hours ago.<br> Yeah. I wonder what<br> made him change his mind.<br> We probably drifted somewhat<br> on account of the current.<br> We've been through all that. What's<br> he doing in this part of the boat, anyway?<br> - Why? Is he in quarantine?<br> - Tell him to get back to the bow, where he belongs.<br> I'll do nothing of the sort.<br> You may be skipper of this lifeboat,<br> but you're not dictator. Or are you?<br> Wait a minute, Kovac. There's no sense<br> treating the man like a leper.<br> He did save Gus's life, you know.<br> For the time being. After all,<br> it was an emergency operation.<br> Don't you realize that it's imperative that<br> we get Gus to a hospital as soon as possible?<br> - Sure, I do.<br> - Then, why not listen to somebody who knows?<br> How do you like that? Now he isn't sure.<br> Says he won't take responsibility.<br> But that's not the point.<br> The point is, are we headed for Bermuda?<br> What's come over the man?<br> All you got to do is answer yes or no.<br> He admits we're on<br> the wrong course.<br> Admits? He's only saying<br> what he said before.<br> - I had to drag it out of him. He says...<br> - I don't care what he says.<br> - Yeah, but suppose he's right.<br> - That's my funeral.<br> No, it's not.<br> It's Gus's funeral.<br> Whose funeral?<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> What is this?<br> Well, fella,<br> how do you feel now, huh?<br> In the pink.<br> Outside of a little hangover.<br> Right now I'd give<br> the other leg for a cigarette.<br> Here, darling.<br> Guess maybe I lost<br> a little weight, huh?<br> You'll be all right, Gus.<br> He did a swell job.<br> Danke schn.<br> Well, skipper, how soon<br> do we get to Bermuda?<br> Pretty soon, Gus. We've got<br> a good breeze and a favoring current.<br> There's a little difference of opinion<br> about the direction we're headed.<br> Trouble is, I'm not sure<br> about our course.<br> I'm only sure of one thing.<br> I don't trust that Nazi.<br> There must be other submarines around and he<br> knows where they are, or maybe a supply ship.<br> He knows where that is too.<br> On general principle,<br> I'd copper anything he says.<br> That's how I stand.<br> You agree with me, Sparks?<br> Well...<br> Does anybody agree with me?<br> You're the skipper.<br> All right, Sparks.<br> Follow the German's course.<br> I, uh, was admiring your bracelet.<br> - Gift from a husband.<br> - It's gorgeous.<br> My first husband.<br> Glad the freighter<br> was torpedoed.<br> - What?<br> - That's what you said yesterday.<br> That was a stupid thing to say.<br> I didn't mean it, exactly.<br> What did you mean, exactly?<br> I only meant I was<br> rather glad that we...<br> Well, I wasn't particularly<br> anxious to get to London.<br> - What are you afraid of in London?<br> - Myself.<br> I mean, uh, it's a personal problem.<br> In other words, l...<br> I know, darling. I know.<br> Genus Homo. Male.<br> And married, but not to me.<br> - You call that a problem?<br> - It is to me.<br> Fiddlesticks.<br> I don't want to pry into<br> your personal affairs, darling...<br> but you know<br> what's the matter with you?<br> You've been reading Kipling.<br> "The sins ye do by two and two...<br> you must pay for one by one."<br> 'Course I don't know<br> who the guy is.<br> But I know men,<br> especially married men.<br> Some of my best friends...<br> Don't let her upset you.<br> - She certainly has a way of getting at things.<br> - That's right.<br> I didn't mind her prying, really.<br> I wanted to talk.<br> Maybe that's why I'm all mixed up,<br> because I've never told anybody.<br> I think I'd rather tell you<br> than anybody.<br> His name is Stephen.<br> He's a doctor.<br> We worked in the same hospital.<br> All the time,<br> I knew he was married.<br> His wife's a fine woman,<br> and they have two beautiful children.<br> So, you see, it was hopeless.<br> It was quite hopeless.<br> Yes, of course. I-I see.<br> Well, we both decided<br> to forget about it.<br> And when he enlisted<br> and was sent to London, I was glad.<br> I was really glad.<br> I tried to forget him,<br> but I couldn't.<br> He wrote several times.<br> I never answered.<br> And then when I was<br> assigned to London myself...<br> Well, I knew if we met there<br> away from home, away from every...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Maybe I better wait till I get home and take it<br> up with Mr. Whosits on the Goodwill Hour.<br> Sometimes that program's funny.<br> Sometimes it isn't a bit.<br> When people are in trouble,<br> they turn themselves inside-out.<br> Seem to feel better when they<br> get some sort of an answer.<br> Whether they get an answer<br> or not, they feel better.<br> Thank you, Stanley.<br> Lovely night we're having.<br> Lots of stars out tonight.<br> I remember the night before we was<br> torpedoed. Nolan was... He was my first.<br> - Yes, I met him on the boat.<br> - That's right. Yes.<br> He was telling me all about his wife<br> going to stay with her family in Bermuda.<br> And how it's changed<br> since the war.<br> He told me that...<br> I remember as he pointed out<br> our course over the bows...<br> I saw the planet Mars<br> low on the horizon.<br> That's Mars over there,<br> to the right.<br> And that's Venus.<br> We're headed for Venus.<br> We're going East.<br> We're not heading for Bermuda.<br> We're heading to miss Bermuda.<br> Well, we'll see about that.<br> After all,<br> we did have to drag it out of...<br> That's part of the trick. He<br> made suckers out of all of us.<br> Kovac, I still say we have no right<br> to condemn the man without a hearing.<br> Perhaps the course he gave us was wrong,<br> but that doesn't prove anything.<br> He might have been mistaken.<br> When I questioned him yesterday,<br> he didn't want to commit himself.<br> He said we couldn't be sure<br> without a compass.<br> The thing to do is to wake him up<br> and question him.<br> We'll get nothing but lies.<br> That's what he was brought up on.<br> And I was brought up under the idea that<br> a man is innocent until he's proved guilty.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Appoint one of us to be his lawyer?<br> But don't you see, without a compass...<br> Mrs. Porter, remember yesterday you looked<br> at your watch and told the German the time?<br> - Yes.<br> - Did he ask you the time?<br> Of course he did.<br> - That's funny.<br> - What's funny about it?<br> - He had a watch of his own.<br> - Well, what of it?<br> If he had a watch, why would he<br> have to ask Mrs. Porter for the time?<br> That doesn't prove anything.<br> Lots of times I have my own watch<br> in my pocket and I ask somebody the time.<br> Lots of people do that. It, uh...<br> It just saves time, that's all.<br> But he looked at his own watch<br> just before he asked Mrs. Porter.<br> Perhaps his own watch stopped.<br> I remember when he asked for the time,<br> he took a squint at the sun.<br> What are you trying to do, convict a man<br> because he looks at the sun?<br> - Is it a crime to ask for the time?<br> - Certainly not.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Ten past 7:00.<br> - I think you're slow.<br> - Slow? That's a Philippe Patek!<br> I wanna know what time it is<br> by the German's watch.<br> Well, why don't you<br> wake him up and ask him?<br> Don't have to wake him up.<br> Not with Joe around.<br> - Joe, operate.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Huh?<br> - Do your stuff.<br> What stuff?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> - Frisk him for his turnip.<br> - You know I cut that stuff out a long time ago.<br> - But this is an emergency. The folks'll understand.<br> - Understand what?<br> - Joe used to be one of the best all-around...<br> - Now, wait a minute, Gus.<br> You ain't got no right<br> bringin' up what used to be.<br> That's all right, Joe.<br> Some of my best friends are...<br> I know, but I made<br> a pledge, a solemn pledge.<br> Do you wanna commit mutiny?<br> - Is it an order?<br> - It's an order.<br> Oh, I can't.<br> The guy's asleep.<br> That's a break, isn't it?<br> Yeah, but it's like... It's like<br> shootin' a sittin' duck.<br> Quit stalling. If your conscience bothers<br> you, wake him up. Only, get the ticker.<br> Kovac.<br> Looks like quite a blow.<br> Pardon me.<br> I'm... sorry.<br> Now, you know the right time...<br> dirty double-crossing rat.<br> Kovac, what are you gonna do?<br> - What do you think we're gonna do?<br> - Don't say "we."<br> - I'll not consent to a thing like this.<br> - I'm not consulting you.<br> There's only one thing<br> to do with the guy.<br> But, Kovac, it's... it's murder!<br> - It's execution.<br> - No, we can't. We mustn't.<br> - There must be some other way.<br> - Why can't we tie him up...<br> - keep a watch on him?<br> - Let him have it, Kovac!<br> - Right now!<br> - I'm not defending the man.<br> But why can't we wait till it's night?<br> Then, in the morning...<br> What are you so squeamish about?<br> We're at war!<br> You've seen 'em<br> killed, haven't you?<br> In battle, yes.<br> But not in cold blood like this.<br> - Look out.!<br> - Stanley.!<br> You fools! Stop thinking of yourselves!<br> Think of the boat!<br> Joe, take the sheet.!<br> Make it fast.!<br> Kovac, man the pump.!<br> The rest of you bail!<br> What do you know?<br> We got a fhrer.<br> Never mind about that baggage!<br> Start bailing!<br> - You speak English!<br> - Of course I speak English!<br> - Can we stay afloat?<br> - Those buoyancy tanks'll hold us up.<br> - Ohhh! My suitcase!<br> - Get that, somebody.!<br> Rittenhouse.!<br> Lash down that food.!<br> There go our rations!<br> There goes our water supply!<br> Look out!<br> We might as well go down<br> together, eh, Connie?<br> - How am I doin', Willi?<br> - Fine, Ritt. Fine.<br> You're a born accompanist.<br> You didn't make<br> a single mistake, hardly.<br> Yeah, I know what<br> you mean. Right in here.<br> Yeah, that's it.<br> Ritt,<br> you're a born accompanist.<br> We're all born accompanists.<br> "How'd I do, Willi?"<br> What are you laughing at,<br> you silly goon?<br> That's one for the book... your book.<br> Only, when you write it,<br> they won't believe it.<br> Our enemy...<br> our prisoner of war.<br> Now, we're his prisoners,<br> and he's gauleiter of the boat...<br> singin' German lullabies<br> to us...<br> while he rows us<br> to his supply ship...<br> and a concentration camp.<br> Tell 'em, Willi.<br> Tell 'em how funny it is.<br> That isn't funny.<br> It's logical.<br> Now that we've been blown off our course,<br> it would take us weeks to get to Bermuda.<br> Certainly. It's perfectly logical.<br> The supply ship was our only chance.<br> You know how I feel about that. I'd rather<br> take my chances with the sharks.<br> But he'll never make it.<br> Without food and water, how long do<br> you think he can keep on rowing like this?<br> Long enough, Mr. Kovac,<br> to reach my objective.<br> Are you sure, Willi?<br> Maybe one of us should had better<br> try to relieve him at the oars.<br> - That's not necessary.<br> - Maybe I can take over for a while.<br> Never mind, I'll row.<br> How can you keep on rowing,<br> Willi, hour after hour?<br> The rest of us<br> can hardly lift an oar.<br> It's the master race...<br> the herrenvolk.<br> - Didn't you know they can do anything?<br> - I'm beginning to believe it.<br> Right living is what does it.<br> Or, as the French say...<br> Qui tot so couche<br> bien se porte.<br> Sacre bleu.!<br> You speak French, also.<br> - Yes. I spent some time in Paris.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Tell me, Willi. Why didn't you speak English<br> when you first got on the boat?<br> Well, you see, I didn't know then<br> whether I could trust you or not.<br> Wie gehts, Herr Schmidt?<br> Name is Smith.<br> All right, Mr. Smith.<br> How do you feel today?<br> Same as yesterday...<br> thirsty.<br> Well, steward, anything<br> from the commissary yet?<br> - Not even a nibble.<br> - Well, keep on trying.<br> If you catch some fish,<br> you'll not only have food, but drink.<br> When you chew raw fish,<br> there's always a little fresh water.<br> Water.<br> There's that cloud.<br> What a day<br> for a ball game.<br> St. Louis's the team<br> to watch this year.<br> If we only had<br> some bait.<br> - St. Louis's got hitters.<br> - It's been there all day.<br> Stan Musial's been<br> cloutin' 'em out.<br> - Sometime they end up a nimbus.<br> - How about Ty Cobb?<br> - Got some A-1 pitchers.<br> - Yeah.<br> If the Dodgers only had a guy like<br> Ernie Bonham, or even Johnnie Humphries.<br> Pittsburgh's the team to watch.<br> Only 17 points below St. Louis.<br> If we beat the Pirates<br> and St. Louis loses to Boston...<br> - Hey, Kovac.<br> - Yeah.<br> Who do you think'll<br> pitch for Pittsburgh today?<br> I don't know. I haven't been<br> following the games much this season.<br> Probably Wyatt for the Dodgers,<br> Sewell for the Pirates.<br> Yeah. Probably Sewell, Gus.<br> - I think I'll take Rosie.<br> - Where to, Gus?<br> Ebbets Field.<br> It's gonna be<br> a good game this afternoon.<br> Ritt.<br> He's off the beam again.<br> Well, Willi, how about<br> another song, eh?<br> Certainly, my friend.<br> What would you like to hear?<br> You think you can remember<br> "Roslein auf der Heide"?<br> - Sure, sure. Which one was that?<br> - Dada-di-dadi-dada<br> Oh, yeah. I know that one,<br> all right. Now, wait a minute.<br> - All right.<br> - I got it.<br> Da-da-da ba-bum barump<br> Bum barump bum barump<br> Ba di da-da<br> - Ritt?<br> - Huh?<br> - Do you know "Drei Liebe"?<br> - You mean, uh, How can I leave...<br> - That's right.<br> - Sure.!<br> Stanley, why do you like to do that?<br> I don't know.<br> I can't sing anymore.<br> Makes me dry.<br> Doesn't it look to you<br> as if those clouds are darkening up?<br> At the center, a bit.<br> Those really are<br> rain clouds this time.<br> - I hope so. For Gus's sake.<br> - That's right.<br> Why don't you give me<br> a break, Loot?<br> The salt'll only<br> make you thirstier.<br> You might<br> just as well sip poison.<br> "B.M." Her initials are larger<br> than the others.<br> Was she the last...<br> or the first?<br> What was her name?<br> - So you won't talk, huh?<br> - Where'd you get the handcuff, Mrs. Porter?<br> You may call me Connie.<br> You did once during the storm,<br> remember?<br> You said, uh...<br> "We might as well<br> go down together, eh, Connie?"<br> I liked the way you said Connie.<br> It was like a sock in the jaw.<br> Tell me about the bracelet.<br> That was a dead giveaway,<br> you know, darling...<br> wanting us to die together like that.<br> Dying together is even more<br> personal than living together.<br> - What'd you pay for the bracelet?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Barter?<br> - You're a low person, darling...<br> obviously out of the gutter.<br> Maybe that's why<br> I'm attracted to you.<br> - Maybe that's why you're attracted to me.<br> - Quit slumming.<br> Funny part of it is,<br> I'm from the same gutter.<br> Remember when you first got<br> on the boat, you said you used to work...<br> in the, uh... the packing house<br> section in Chicago?<br> Well, I came from there too.<br> - South Side?<br> - Ashland Avenue...<br> back of the yards.<br> And I lived there<br> until I got this.<br> It worked miracles for me.<br> It took me from the, uh...<br> South Side to the North Side.<br> It was my passport...<br> from the stockyards<br> to the Gold Coast.<br> It got me everything<br> I wanted...<br> up to now.<br> Quit slumming!<br> - How about a few hands, Ritt?<br> - Huh? Suits me fine.<br> - Do this up for me.<br> - Connie, I'll fix it for you.<br> Come on, Ritt.<br> - Kovac, how much do I owe you?<br> - Twelve thousand bucks.<br> Merely temporary, my friend.<br> I'll get it back.<br> - Deal 'em.<br> - Looks like bits of ice.<br> - I wish they were.<br> - They're really nothing but a few pieces of carbon...<br> crystallized under high pressure<br> at great heat.<br> Quite so, if you want<br> to be scientific about it.<br> I'm a great believer<br> in science.<br> Like tears, for instance.<br> They're nothing but H2O...<br> with a trace<br> of sodium chloride.<br> He likes you,<br> but he hates the bracelet.<br> - You will have to get rid of it.<br> - Bracelet?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - I've worn it for 15 years.<br> - It's brought me nothing but good luck.<br> - He hates it.<br> I wouldn't take it off<br> for anything or anybody in the world.<br> In the old days, there was a place<br> in Boston, Young's Hotel...<br> had the best restaurant<br> in the world.<br> Bet it wasn't any better than<br> Henrici's Coffee House in Chicago...<br> or Bookbinder's in Philly.<br> That was food for you.<br> There, it's fixed. In Munich,<br> there is a place called Lorber's.<br> - Their specialty is pot roast.<br> - Pot roast.<br> Young's used to have a menu<br> Yes, sir, 150 solid pages<br> of eatments.<br> And, oh, boy,<br> what eatments.<br> - Ever eat<br> in Antoine's in New Orleans?<br> Can't compare with Young's.<br> You never tasted such food in your life...<br> 'specially seafood...<br> steamed clams dripping<br> with melted butter...<br> Iobsters, lobsters a la Newburg<br> with a special white wine sauce.<br> - Ritt, shut up!<br> - What's wrong?<br> Stop jabbering about food!<br> Isn't it enough we've lost all our<br> supplies through your carelessness?<br> - Carelessness?<br> - Yes, stupid, criminal carelessness!<br> But it wasn't me. I wasn't in charge<br> of the food. The commissary was Joe's job.<br> - You dirty rat, trying to shift the blame ontoJoe.<br> - Maybe it was my f...<br> No, it wasn't! If you'd had brains,<br> you'd have taken care of them...<br> - when you saw the storm coming.<br> - My dear Connie, what's the matter with you?<br> She's all right,<br> just a little bit hungry.<br> What are you squawking about?<br> lt'll make a swell chapter.<br> "How It Feels To Be Starving,"<br> first-person, singular.<br> Those are good things to<br> write about, hunger and thirst.<br> If you really come from<br> back of the yard...<br> Kovac, why don't you kill Willi?<br> Why don't you cut his throat,<br> like you said you would?<br> I'll tell you why.<br> You're not strong enough!<br> He's made of iron!<br> The rest of us are just flesh and blood...<br> hungry flesh and blood, and thirsty.<br> For the love of Mike,<br> will you throw that ratty cigar stub away?<br> - Why should I? Does it annoy you?<br> - Yes, it makes me nervous...<br> - watching you chew on it all the time.<br> - Well, it makes me feel good.<br> Oh, you feel good, do you?<br> That's fine. Fine.<br> Ritt, how much money<br> are you worth?<br> - Enough to buy and sell you a million times.<br> - How about raising the ante?<br> - Anything you say.<br> - From now on, each stick is $100.<br> - Anything you say.<br> - Deal 'em.<br> Anything you...<br> - How many factories do you own, Ritt?<br> - What business is that of yours?<br> I was just thinking. By the time<br> we get home, I might own one of them.<br> Bet a hundred.<br> Raise a hundred.<br> - Stay.<br> - How many cards do you want?<br> - Three.<br> - Three to you. Three to the dealer.<br> Think I'll go for one<br> of your airplane plants.<br> - I've got ideas of my own about how to run a factory.<br> - Yeah, into the ground.<br> I'll have a labor-management committee.<br> We'll hold a meeting every week. And first...<br> Are you trying to tell me<br> how to run my own factories?<br> Not all of them, just the one<br> I'm gonna own.<br> - Bet a hundred.<br> - I'll see you. Queens.<br> Kings.<br> You know, it's mighty funny<br> how you keep winning all the pots.<br> - I'm a lucky guy.<br> - Well, just the same...<br> I wish we had<br> a new deck of cards.<br> Give me<br> another stack of chips.<br> - That's another thousand.<br> - Your deal.<br> - Sorry, Ritt.<br> - Cut you in?<br> My credit still good?<br> - Well, uh, your bracelet.<br> - No, thanks.<br> - What's the score?<br> - 13,500.<br> - How about raising the ante?<br> - It's your funeral.<br> - Thousand dollars apiece?<br> - Right.<br> Okay.<br> I'll open for a thousand.<br> Raise ya two.<br> I'll raise you two.<br> Call.<br> - How many?<br> - Two cards.<br> Someday you'll learn it doesn't pay<br> to hold a kicker...<br> if you live long enough.<br> Just to keep the pikers out...<br> - I'll bet five.<br> - Matched your kicker, huh?<br> Five's the bet.<br> Put up...<br> - or shut up.<br> - And raise you five.<br> Kovac, now you're talking<br> my language.<br> This is the moment<br> I've been waiting for.<br> I have got you over a barrel.<br> We'll do the bookkeeping later.<br> I'll see your five...<br> and I'll raise you...<br> all the chips you've got, plus...<br> all the money I owe you.<br> Kovac, looks as if you've<br> stepped out of your class this time.<br> See you, Rittenhouse. What have you got?<br> I've got...<br> That was my pot.<br> You couldn't possibly beat me.<br> - I have a full house.<br> - And I had four deuces.<br> - How do I know you had four deuces?<br> - You ought to know.<br> You made the cards,<br> didn't you?<br> And you marked 'em too!<br> They are crooked,<br> and you are crooked!<br> It's raining.<br> - It's raining!<br> - It's raining!<br> Get the sail.!<br> - Here.<br> - That's right.<br> I was at the wheel when she hit.<br> My watch<br> was just about over...<br> and I was goin'down<br> for some hotjava.<br> When she keeled over...<br> the siren was screamin'...<br> like a human being<br> she was screamin'...<br> right to the end.<br> Oh, you should've heard<br> the sound of the rain...<br> drummin' on the canvas.<br> Most beautiful sound<br> you ever heard in your life.<br> I looked up...<br> a couple of drops...<br> fell right on my lips.<br> Hey, Joe.<br> What's the matter?<br> Why have you<br> stopped playin'?<br> Come on.<br> Heat it up.<br> Give it the HarryJames.<br> Gee, Rosie.<br> You're an armful.<br> An armful of honey, that's what you are.<br> Say, Rosie, I'm thirsty.<br> How about a drink?<br> Set 'em up, Pete.<br> Nice tall ones...<br> plenty of ice.<br> Here's to you,<br> Rosie baby.<br> What is it, Gus?<br> Willi's got some water.<br> That's right, Gus.<br> I just had a tall one,<br> plenty of ice.<br> Sure, Gus. Sure.<br> - But Willi only had water.<br> - That's right.<br> Uh, I guess<br> I'll get back to Rosie.<br> Willi, where'd you get the water?<br> - You've been holdin' out on us.<br> - You mustn't wake up the others.<br> They are tired.<br> Well, what about you?<br> - Ain't you tired?<br> - No.<br> Me neither.<br> I feel fine...<br> except my right foot's asleep.<br> I can hardly feel it.<br> Willi, tell me.<br> Do you think I should<br> write to Rosie, tell her about it?<br> Or should I wait till I see her?<br> - Wait till you see her.<br> - Yeah, but...<br> I can't walk in on her<br> gimpy and all like this...<br> without no...<br> warning, can I?<br> I got to find some way to...<br> - to break it to her gentle.<br> - It'll be all right.<br> Okay.<br> - So long, Willi.<br> - Good-bye, Gus.<br> I'll never forget<br> what you done for me.<br> If there's anything I can ever<br> do for you, just let me know.<br> There is something<br> you can do for me.<br> Remember<br> your name is Schmidt.<br> Uh, you like it better<br> than Smith?<br> Much better.<br> - You'd better hurry, Gus. She's waiting.<br> - Okay.<br> - That water you was drinkin'...<br> - Rosie's waiting for you.<br> - Why didn't you share it with the rest of us?<br> - Shh.!<br> You mustn't wake them.<br> - Okay, Willi.<br> - Why don't you go after Rosie?<br> She's waiting for you at Roseland.<br> There. Do you see the lights?<br> Help!<br> Stanley!<br> Help.!<br> Stanley?<br> Stanley!<br> Willi, he's got...<br> Help!<br> H-H-Help!<br> - Where's Gus?<br> - He's gone over.<br> - No use, Stan...<br> - Gus.!<br> - He went under.<br> - Gus.!<br> Willi, what is it?<br> What's happened?<br> - Schmidt went over the side.<br> - He was calling my name.<br> - That's what woke me.<br> - You can't imagine how painful it was to me.<br> All night long, to watch him...<br> turning and suffering<br> and nothing I could do for him.<br> - Why didn't you stop rowing?<br> - Why should I?<br> - To help him!<br> - The best way to help him was to let him go.<br> I had no right to stop him,<br> even if I wanted to.<br> A poor cripple dying<br> of hunger and thirst...<br> what good could life be<br> to a man like that?<br> He was trying to tell me something.<br> If I could only remember.<br> He's better off now,<br> out of his trouble.<br> - Something about water.<br> - He was in agony from thirst.<br> I wanted to cry,<br> but the tears wouldn't come.<br> No, how could they?<br> If I remember rightly, tears are water...<br> with a trace of sodium chloride.<br> - Isn't that so, Willi?<br> - Ja.<br> What about sweat?<br> What's the chemical<br> composition of sweat?<br> Water... with a trace<br> of something or other.<br> Now, I remember.<br> Gus said<br> Willi had some water.<br> Yeah.<br> Right under his shirt!<br> Quite so.<br> I took the precaution of filling the flask<br> from the water breakers...<br> before the storm, just in case of emergency.<br> And I had food tablets<br> and energy pills too.<br> Everybody on the U-boat has them.<br> You should be grateful to me<br> for having the foresight to think ahead.<br> To survive, one must have a plan.<br> But there's nothing<br> to worry about.<br> Soon we'll reach<br> the supply ship...<br> and then we'll all have<br> food and water.<br> - Too bad Schmidt couldn't have waited.<br> - You!<br> Please, don't...<br> Please, Miss Alice!<br> To my dying day,<br> I'll never understand Willi...<br> or what he did.<br> First, he tried to kill us all<br> with his torpedoes.<br> Nevertheless, we fished him<br> out of the sea...<br> took him aboard,<br> shared everything we had with him.<br> You would've thought<br> he'd been grateful.<br> All he could do<br> was to plot against us.<br> Then he...<br> he let poor old Gus<br> die of thirst.<br> What do you do<br> with people like that?<br> Maybe one of us<br> ought to try to row.<br> Where to?<br> What for?<br> Nah.<br> When we killed the German,<br> we killed our motor.<br> No. We still got a motor.<br> Eh? Who?<br> Nah.<br> We're through.<br> Are you afraid?<br> No. I don't think so.<br> If we had got out of it, l...<br> I was going to<br> ask you to marry me.<br> What do you think<br> you'd have said?<br> I think I would've said yes.<br> Well, then, whatever happens...<br> I'd like you to marry me.<br> Congratulations.<br> Well, that's settled.<br> And what now, little men?<br> I've been a widower for 18 years.<br> We never had any children.<br> All I leave behind me...<br> is a great many<br> millions of dollars.<br> I hope they do<br> somebody some good.<br> So, we're all going<br> to fold up and die...<br> just because that<br> ersatz superman is gone.<br> My only regret is...<br> that in the end...<br> I joined a mob.<br> Baloney.<br> We weren't a mob<br> when we killed him.<br> We were a mob<br> when we sat around...<br> prisoners of the man<br> we'd saved...<br> kowtowing to him,<br> obeying him...<br> practically heiling him...<br> because he was kind enough and strong<br> enough to take us to a concentration camp!<br> Good grief, look at you.<br> Rittenhouse,<br> C.J. Rittenhouse...<br> self-made man.<br> Made of what?<br> As long as you're sitting there,<br> thinking of your last will and testament...<br> I'll write your epitaph for you now.<br> "Ritt, he quit."<br> That goes for you too, Narcissus.<br> It's a good thing there's room on that<br> chest of yours for another letter...<br> "Q" for quitter!<br> And you, Joe...<br> it's all right for you to look up<br> and trust in somebody.<br> How about giving him a hand?<br> What's the matter with us?<br> We not only let the Nazi<br> do our rowing for us, but our thinking!<br> Ye Gods and little fishes.<br> Fishes.<br> Ye Gods.<br> We haven't got<br> energy pills...<br> but the ocean's full of them...<br> millions of fish swimming around.<br> - Well, why don't we catch some?<br> - We tried that.<br> - We have no bait.<br> - Sure, we have... bait...<br> - by Cartier.<br> - Are you kidding?<br> Kidding, my foot.<br> I'm starving.<br> Well, what are you<br> waiting around for?<br> Where's the fish line?<br> Bait your line, chum.<br> Not only food, but oil.<br> We can squeeze the fish for oil.<br> It's better than water.<br> I can recommend the bait.<br> I ought to know. I bit on it myself.<br> I've never eaten raw fish before.<br> I have. It's not bad.<br> We'd better not count our chickens<br> before they're hatched.<br> What do you mean, "chickens"?<br> There never yet was a poor fish<br> that wouldn't bite on one of those.<br> Strike!<br> - It's a good one!<br> - Careful!<br> - Easy.<br> - Easy does it.<br> - Don't let him have slack.<br> - Easy.<br> - There's a ship.<br> - Huh?<br> Gangway!<br> Why, you... My bracelet!<br> It's the supply ship, all right.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Willi's had the last word at that.<br> Well, some of my best friends<br> are in concentration camps.<br> Do you suppose they'll have<br> any coffee aboard...<br> real coffee?<br> - Hello!<br> - What'd he say?<br> He says, yes,<br> they have some coffee...<br> and Wiener schnitzel<br> and pig's knuckles...<br> and sauerkraut<br> and... apple strudel...<br> - hot.<br> - Look.<br> The supply ship's signaling.<br> What's happening?<br> Why are they turning around?<br> Maybe they forgot<br> the cream for the coffee.<br> They're not going<br> to pick us up. Hey!<br> Well, that's... that's impossible.<br> They can't leave us here like this.<br> Why...
