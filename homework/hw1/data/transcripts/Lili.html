We'll try it tomorrow.<br> Well, not tomorrow, perhaps,<br> but we'd like you<br> to be ready to open<br> in about two weeks.<br> Two weeks?<br> Tonit?<br> You're Antoine Tonit<br> of the Folies Paris!<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought I'd told you.<br> Tonit and Erique.<br> - As for the details of the contract,<br> if you'll come back<br> to the hotel with us now...<br> fine.<br> We'll have to let you know.<br> We can't accept now.<br> But you have no contract here.<br> You're free.<br> Completely.<br> We'll have to let you know.<br> But we know now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> We have to talk about this.<br> By all means...<br> What do we have<br> to talk over?<br> But don't dismiss<br> this offer too lightly.<br> The act is nothing<br> without the girl.<br> I agree.<br> She's enchanting.<br> But this one,<br> the creativeness is his.<br> He has a talent for improvisation<br> that I've never seen before.<br> It's close to genius.<br> You've hit on a new career, Berthalet,<br> that'll outstrip anything<br> you could've done as a dancer.<br> But you must know this,<br> or you wouldn't have<br> given up your dancing for it.<br> I didn't give up anything.<br> I became a puppeteer<br> because it was the only way<br> I could earn enough to feed myself.<br> You see, a dancer grows<br> conscious of his body.<br> When it'll no longer do<br> what he wants it to do,<br> he grows to hate it.<br> So I hid mine behind the curtain<br> of a puppet stage.<br> I'm sorry.<br> We didn't know.<br> We've been tactless, I'm afraid.<br> No. You've done the greatest thing<br> for me you could've done.<br> Tell me again what you said.<br> You mean that I think<br> you've chosen a new career<br> that'll outstrip anything<br> you might've done as a dancer?<br> But you said that before<br> you knew I was lame.<br> You meant it?<br> I meant it and more.<br> I'll underwrite your new career.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Tomorrow.<br> What was that nonsense<br> about letting them know?<br> You think to get more money<br> out of them by saying<br> we're unwilling?<br> I said it because I'm not sure<br> you have an act to sell.<br> Lili is leaving.<br> What did you do to her?<br> Stopped her from making<br> a fool of herself.<br> Leaving?<br> That child's an idiot.<br> She's not an idiot.<br> And she isn't a child any longer.<br> She's beginning to realize the fact<br> that there's cruelty in the world...<br> and she's starting<br> to protect herself from it.<br> Well...what do we do now?<br> You'll figure it out.<br> You're the genius.<br> [ Knock knock ]<br> [ Marc ] Come in.<br> Well.<br> It's all right if Rosie is coming.<br> What I have to say<br> won't take very long.<br> Here's something you<br> lost in the trailer.<br> Oh.<br> I didn't know at first.<br> And I wanted to ask you,<br> but now I think I know.<br> You're married<br> to Rosalie.<br> I never denied it.<br> No, you didn't.<br> - Ah.<br> And I've been silly.<br> But I've put a lot of things<br> together in my head<br> this last half hour.<br> A great many things,<br> back to the day we met.<br> I know I've been living in a dream,<br> just like a little girl...<br> without seeing what I didn't<br> want to see...<br> but you want to know<br> something, Marc?<br> We sometimes outgrow<br> feelings and ideas,<br> just like a little girl<br> outgrows her dresses,<br> but somehow, it turns out that<br> there's a right time for everything...<br> in the right order.<br> There's a time for going to school.<br> A time for losing our parents,<br> and a time for falling in love<br> with a beautiful magician.<br> But there's a time for waking up.<br> You are a wise girl...Lili.<br> Where did you learn all this?<br> We don't learn.<br> We just get older...<br> and we know.<br> Good-bye, Marc.<br> Good-bye.<br> Thank you for your patience.<br> Forgive me for having been<br> such a nuisance.<br> Oh, Rosalie,<br> I'm...I'm leaving.<br> I just said good-bye<br> to your husband.<br> Good-bye.<br> Lili?<br> Oh, Lili, please, wait a minute.<br> Are you gonna leave<br> without saying good-bye?<br> Please, Lili, just for a minute,<br> come here.<br> Please? Closer.<br> I have a favor to ask, and<br> I don't want the others to hear.<br> If you're leaving, Lili,<br> please take me with you.<br> I wanna go with you,<br> wherever you go.<br> It won't be the same<br> here without you.<br> You're my sweetheart, you see?<br> It was love at first sight.<br> From the first moment I saw you<br> walking by, wearing that... awful hat,<br> and carrying that lopsided suitcase.<br> Please...oh, please don't<br> leave us, Lili!<br> I never had a real friend<br> until you came along.<br> Please take me with you.<br> If you really loved us,<br> you wouldn't go away.<br> Oh, but I do.<br> It's just that I...<br> I'll say it.<br> You hate the boss.<br> He's unreasonable.<br> He's mean.<br> He's jealous.<br> We'll protect you from him.<br> Oh, you always have.<br> You've always been<br> so kind and good...<br> and you seem to know<br> what's in my heart or<br> what I'm thinking<br> and what I'm feeling.<br> I'll kill him!<br> I'm gonna kill the boss! Grrr!<br> Well, anyway, I'll give him<br> a good talking to.<br> Hey, boss...<br> Lili?<br> Here.<br> It's our going-away present.<br> Oh, Reynardo...how very nice.<br> It was very expensive.<br> He probably stole it.<br> You know Reynardo.<br> How did you get it, Reynardo?<br> Well, must I tell?<br> Reynardo, you promised me<br> you would never steal again.<br> I didn't steal it.<br> If you must know, I'm paying for it<br> on the installment plan.<br> What happens if you don't<br> keep up with the payments?<br> I know him.<br> He'll never keep up.<br> They'll come and<br> take it away from you.<br> No, they won't.<br> I made a deal.<br> What sort of a deal?<br> Well, I agreed that if I didn't<br> keep up with the payments,<br> I'd give the man something<br> else in exchange.<br> I signed a paper.<br> Uh-oh.<br> He signed a paper.<br> What does the man<br> get in exchange?<br> Another fox fur.<br> Another?<br> Uh-huh...<br> me.<br> Well, you poor darling.<br> You traded your life<br> to get me a present.<br> - Mmm.<br> Oh, Reynardo, you...<br> Trust him to take advantage<br> of a situation like this.<br> I wanna go with you, Lili.<br> Why don't you take<br> us all with you?<br> We don't want you<br> to forget us, Lili.<br> I never could forget you.<br> You've become so<br> very dear to me.<br> You're the only things I love.<br> I know you love me, too.<br> Why, you poor darlings,<br> you're trembling.<br> Well, are you staying or going?<br> We've had an offer<br> from the Folies Paris,<br> but we can't accept it<br> without you.<br> I've been an idiot,<br> a stupid fool.<br> Melting and sniveling over<br> Reynardo and Carrot Top.<br> I must be crazy.<br> They've become<br> so very dear to me,<br> I forget...I forget every time<br> that it's only you.<br> Or is it you?<br> Is it?<br> Wh-what are you?<br> Are you just a monster<br> without any feeling?<br> Why can't you ever say<br> a kind word?<br> Why do you hide<br> behind those puppets?<br> I am the puppets!<br> I'm Carrot Top: Confident, clever,<br> capable of running his life and yours<br> and everybody else's.<br> And I'm Golo the Giant:<br> Cowardly, stupid,<br> longing to be loved, clumsy,<br> and in need of comforting.<br> And I'm Marguerite, too:<br> Vain, jealous, obsessed with self,<br> looking at my face in the mirror.<br> Are my teeth nice?<br> Is my hair growing thin?<br> And I'm Reynardo<br> the thief, the opportunist,<br> full of compromise and lies.<br> Like any other man, I have in me<br> all these things,<br> all of these and<br> as many more again.<br> Must I make a new puppet<br> for the small part of me<br> you've managed to see?<br> The monster?<br> The angry man?<br> The frustrated dancer, clumping along<br> with a leg anchored to the ground,<br> and a heart anchored to...<br> but you don't have to understand me<br> or even like me.<br> This is business.<br> Not anymore.<br>
