                        Some of us was<br> in the Second Kansas Colored.<br> We fought the Rebs at<br> Jenkins' Ferry last April<br> just after they killed every Negro soldier<br> they captured at Poison Springs.<br> So at Jenkins' Ferry,<br> we decided warn't takin'<br> no Reb prisoners.<br> And we didn't leave a one of 'em alive.<br> The ones of us that didn't die that day,<br> we joined up with<br> the 116th U.S. Colored, sir,<br> from Camp Nelson, Kentucky.<br> What's your name, soldier?<br> Private. Harold Green, sir.<br> I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir.<br> Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.<br> We're waiting over there.<br> We're leaving our horses behind<br> and shipping outwith the 24th Infantry<br> for the assault next week on Wilmington.<br> How long<br> have you been a soldier?<br> Two years, sir.<br> The Second Kansas<br> Colored Infantry,<br> they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.<br> That's right, sir.<br> They killed<br> a thousand Rebel soldiers, sir.<br> They were very brave.<br> And making $3 less each month<br> than white soldiers.<br> Us Second Kansas boys...<br> Another $3 subtracted<br> from our pay for our uniforms.<br> That was true, yes sir,<br> but that's changed.<br> Equal pay now, but still<br> no commissioned Negro officers.<br> I'm aware of that,<br> Corporal Clark.<br> Yes, sir.<br> That's good that you're aware, sir...<br> Do you think the Wilmington attack...<br> Now that white people<br> have accustomed themselves<br> to seeing Negro men with guns<br> fighting on their behalf,<br> and now that they can tolerate<br> Negro soldiers getting equal pay<br> maybe in a few years,<br> they can abide the idea<br> of Negro lieutenants and captains.<br> In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.<br> In a hundred years, the vote.<br> What will you do after the war,<br> Corporal Clark?<br> Work, sir.<br> - Hm.<br> - Perhaps you'll hire me.<br> Perhaps I will.<br> But you should know, sir,<br> that I get sick at the smell of boot black<br> and I cannot cut hair.<br> I've yet to find a man could cut mine<br> so that it'd make any difference.<br> You got springy hair<br> for a white man.<br> Yes, I do.<br> My last barber hanged himself.<br> And the one before that.<br> Left me his scissors in his will.<br> President Lincoln, sir.<br> Good evening, boys.<br> We saw you, and...<br> - We were at...<br> - We was at Gettysburg.<br> You boys fight at Gettysburg?<br> No, didn't fight there,<br> we just signed up last month.<br> We saw him two years ago<br> at the cemetery dedication.<br> Yeah. We heard you speak...<br> Goddamn.<br> Uh, hey, how tall are you, anyway?<br> Aw, jeez, shut up.<br> Could you hear what I said?<br> No, sir. Not much.<br> It was...<br> "Four score and seven years ago,<br> our fathers brought forth<br> from this continent<br> a new nation, conceived in liberty<br> and dedicated to the proposition<br> that all men are created equal."<br> That's good. Thank you.<br> "Now we are engaged<br> in a great civil war,<br> testing whether that nation<br> or any nation<br> so conceived and so dedicated,<br> can long endure."<br> "We are met on a great<br> battlefield of that war."<br> That's good, thank you.<br> "We come to dedicate<br> a portion of that field<br> as a final resting place<br> for those who here<br> gave their lives<br> that that nation might live."<br> His uncles, they died<br> on the second day of fighting.<br> I know the last part. It is, uh...<br> Company up! Moving out!<br> You boys best go<br> and find your company.<br> - And thank you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - God bless you.<br> - God bless you, too.<br> God bless you.<br> "That we here highly resolve<br> that these dead<br> shall not have died in vain."<br> "That this nation, under God,<br> shall have a new birth of freedom<br> and that government<br> of the people, by the people,<br> for the people<br> shall not perish from the earth."<br> It's nighttime.<br> Ship's moved by some terrible power<br> at a terrific speed.<br> And though it's imperceptible<br> in the darkness,<br> I have an intuition that<br> we're headed towards a shore.<br> No one else seems to be<br> aboard the vessel.<br> I'm very keenly aware of my aloneness.<br> "I could be bounded in a nutshell<br> and count myself<br> a king of infinite space<br> were it not that I have bad dreams."<br> Hmm.<br> I reckon it's the speed<br> that's strange to me.<br> I'm used to going at a deliberate pace.<br> I should spare you, Molly.<br> I shouldn't tell you my dreams.<br> I don't want to be spared if you aren't.<br> And you spare me nothing.<br> Perhaps it's...<br> It's the assault on Wilmington Port.<br> You dream about the ship<br> before a battle, usually.<br> How's the coconut?<br> Beyond description.<br> Almost two years, nothing mends.<br> Another casualty of the war.<br> Who wants to listen to a useless woman<br> grouse about her carriage accident?<br> - I do.<br> - Stuff.<br> You tell me dreams, that's all.<br> I'm your soothsayer.<br> That's all I am to you anymore.<br> I'm not to be trusted<br> even if it was not a carriage accident.<br> Even if it was<br> an attempted assassination.<br> It was most probably an accident.<br> It was an assassin<br> whose intended target was you.<br> How are the plans coming along<br> for the big shindy?<br> I don't want to talk about parties.<br> You don't care about parties.<br> Not much, but they're<br> a necessary hindrance.<br> I know.<br> I know what it's about, the ship.<br> It's not Wilmington Port.<br> It's not a military campaign.<br> It's the amendment to abolish slavery.<br> Why else would you force me<br> to invite demented radicals<br> into my home?<br> You're going to try to get<br> the amendment passed<br> in the House of Representatives<br> before the term ends?<br> Before the Inauguration?<br> Don't spend too much money<br> on the flubdubs.<br> No one is loved as much as you.<br> No one's ever been loved<br> so much by the people.<br> You might do anything now.<br> Don't... Don't waste that power<br> on an amendment bill<br> that's sure of defeat.<br> Did you remember Robert's<br> coming home for the reception?<br> Mm?<br> I knew you'd forget.<br> That's the ship you're sailing on,<br> the 13th Amendment.<br> You needn't tell me I'm right.<br> I know I am.<br> - Oh!<br> Oh, it's late, Mrs. Keckley.<br> Well, she needs this<br> for the grand reception.<br> It's slow work.<br> Good night.<br> Did you tell her a dream?<br> - Papa.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Papa, I want to see Willie.<br> Me, too, Taddie, but we can't.<br> Why not?<br> Willie's gone.<br> It's three years now he's gone.<br> The part assigned to me<br> is to raise the flag.<br> Which, if there be no fault<br> in the machinery, I will do.<br> And when up<br> it'll be for the people to keep it up.<br> That's my speech.<br> We are coming, Father Abraham <br> Three hundred thousand more <br> From Mississippi's winding stream <br> And from New England's shore <br> We leave our plow and workshops <br> Our wives... <br> Even if every Republican<br> in the House votes yes,<br> far from guaranteed.<br> Since when has our party<br> unanimously supported anything?<br> But say all our fellow Republicans<br> vote for it.<br> We'd still be twenty votes short.<br> Only twenty?<br> "Only twenty?"<br> We can find twenty votes.<br> Twenty House Democrats<br> who'll vote to abolish slavery?<br> In my opinion...<br> To which I always listen.<br> - Or pretend to.<br> - With all three of my ears.<br> We'll win the war soon.<br> It's inevitable, isn't it?<br> Well, it ain't won yet.<br> You'll begin your second term<br> with semi-divine stature.<br> Imagine the possibilities<br> peace will bring.<br> Why tarnish your invaluable luster<br> with a battle in the House?<br> It's a rat's nest in there.<br> It's the same gang of<br> talentless hicks and hacks<br> who rejected the amendment<br> We'll lose.<br> I like our chances now.<br> Well, consider the obstacles<br> that we'd face.<br> The aforementioned two-thirds majority<br> needed to pass an amendment.<br> We have a Republican majority,<br> but barely more than 50%.<br> Fifty-six.<br> We need Democratic support.<br> There's none to be had.<br> Since the House<br> last voted on the amendment,<br> there's been an election.<br> Sixty-four Democrats<br> lost their House seats in November.<br> That's 64 Democrats<br> looking for work come March.<br> I know.<br> They don't need to<br> worry about re-election.<br> They can vote however it suits them.<br> But we can't buy the vote<br> for the amendment.<br> - It's too important.<br> I said nothing of buying anything.<br> We need twenty votes was all I said.<br> Start of my second term,<br> plenty of positions to fill.<br> Mr. President, may I present<br> Mr. and Mrs. Jolly<br> who've come from Missouri...<br> From Jeff City, President.<br> Mr. Jolly.<br> Ma'am.<br> And this here by the fire<br> is Secretary of State Seward.<br> Jeff City?<br> I heard tell once<br> of a Jefferson City lawyer<br> who had a parrot<br> that'd wake him<br> each morning, crying out,<br> "Today is the day the world shall end,<br> as scripture has foretold."<br> And, uh, one day<br> the lawyer shot him,<br> for the sake of peace and quiet,<br> I presume.<br> Thus fulfilling, for the bird at least,<br> his prophecy.<br> There's only one toll booth in Jeff City,<br> to the southwest<br> and this man<br> Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla<br> been in illegal possession<br> for near two yar<br> since your man General Schofield<br> set him up there.<br> But President Monroe give that toll gate<br> to my grandpap<br> and Quincy Adams<br> give my pap a letter<br> saying it's our'n for keeps.<br> Mrs. Jolly got the...<br> Show Mr. Lincoln<br> the Quincy Adams letter.<br> That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.<br> Just tell me what you want from me.<br> Mr. Jolly's emphysema<br> don't care for cigars.<br> Madame, do you know<br> about the proposed<br> Yes, sir, everybody knows of it.<br> The President favors it.<br> - Do you?<br> - We do.<br> You know that it abolishes slavery?<br> Yes, sir, I know it.<br> And is that why you favor it?<br> What I favor is ending the war.<br> Once we do away with slavery,<br> the Rebs'll quit fighting<br> since slavery's what they're fighting for.<br> Mr. Lincoln, you always says so.<br> With the amendment, slavery's ended.<br> And they'll give up.<br> The war can finish then.<br> If the war finished first,<br> before we end slavery...<br> President Lincoln<br> says the war won't stop<br> unless we finish slavery.<br> But if it did.<br> The South is exhausted.<br> If they run out of bullets and men<br> would you still want your...<br> Who's your Representative?<br> Jeff City? That's Congressman Burton.<br> "Beanpole" Burton.<br> I mean, Josiah Burton, yes, sir.<br> A Republican,<br> undecided on the question<br> of the amendment, I believe.<br> Perhaps you could call on him<br> and inform him of your enthusiasm.<br> Yeah.<br> Madame.<br> If the Rebels surrendered next week<br> would you, at the end of this month<br> want Congressman Burton to vote<br> for the 13th Amendment?<br> If that was how it was,<br> no more war and all<br> I reckon Mr. Jolly<br> much prefer not to have<br> Congress pass the amendment.<br> Hmm. And, uh<br> why is that?<br> Niggers.<br> If he don't have to<br> let some Alabama coon<br> come up to Missouri<br> steal his chickens and his job,<br> we'd much prefer that.<br> The people.<br> I begin to see why<br> you're in such a great hurry<br> to put it through.<br> Would you let me study this letter, sir,<br> about the toll booth?<br> Come back to me in the morning<br> and we'll consider what the law says.<br> You be sure to<br> visit Beanpole.<br> Tell him that you support<br> passage of the amendment<br> as a military necessity.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, Nicolay, when you have a moment.<br> If procuring votes<br> with offers of employment<br> is what you intend<br> I'll fetch a friend from Albany<br> who can supply the skulky men<br> gifted at this kind of shady work<br> and spare me the indignity<br> of actually speaking to Democrats.<br> Spare you the exposure and liability.<br> Pardon me, that's a distress signal<br> which I am bound,<br> by solemn oath, to respond to.<br> Tom Pendel took away<br> the glass camera plates<br> of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over<br> because Tom says Mama says<br> they're too distressing.<br> You had nightmares all night long.<br> I'll have worse nightmares<br> if you don't let me look<br> at the plates again.<br> Perhaps.<br> You can't afford a single defection<br> from anyone in the party.<br> Not even a single Republican<br> absent when they vote.<br> You know who you've got to see.<br> Send over to Blair House.<br> Ask Preston Blair<br> can I call on him around 5:00.<br> God help you.<br> God alone knows<br> what he'll ask you to give him.<br> If the Blairs tell them to,<br> no Republican will balk<br> at voting for the amendment.<br> No conservative Republican<br> is what you mean.<br> All Republicans<br> ought to be conservative.<br> I founded this party,<br> in my own goddamn home, to be a<br> conservative anti-slavery party,<br> not a hobbyhorse for<br> goddamn radical abolitionists.<br> Damp down the dyspepsia, Daddy.<br> You'll frighten the child.<br> You need us to keep<br> the conservative side<br> of the party in the traces<br> while you diddle the radicals<br> and bundle up<br> with Thaddeus Stevens's gang!<br> You need our help!<br> Yes, sir, I do.<br> Well, what do we get?<br> Whoa! Blunt!<br> Your manners, Monty,<br> must be why Mr. Lincoln<br> pushed you out of his Cabinet.<br> - I wasn't pushed!<br> - Oh, of course you weren't.<br> He was pushed out to<br> placate the damn radicals!<br> - I agreed to resign.<br> - Oh, Daddy, please! Daddy.<br> Oh. You don't mind, boy, do you?<br> He spends his days with soldiers.<br> They taught me a song.<br> Did they?<br> Soldiers know all manner of songs.<br> How's your brother Bob?<br> He's at school now, but he's coming<br> to visit in four days for the shindy.<br> At school. Ain't that fine?<br> Good he's not in the Army.<br> He wants to be,<br> but Mama said he cannot.<br> Dangerous life, soldiering.<br> Your mama is wise<br> to keep him clean out of that.<br> Now, your daddy knows that what I want<br> in return for all the help I can give him<br> is to go down to Richmond,<br> like he said I could<br> as soon as Savannah fell<br> and talk to Jefferson Davis.<br> Now give me terms<br> I can offer to Jefferson Davis<br> to start negotiating for peace.<br> He'll talk to me.<br> Conservative members of your party<br> want you to listen<br> to overtures from Richmond.<br> That above all!<br> They'll vote for this rash<br> and dangerous amendment<br> only if every other possibility<br> is exhausted.<br> Our Republicans ain't abolitionists.<br> We can't tell our people<br> they can vote yes<br> on abolishing slavery<br> unless at the same time we can tell them<br> that you're seeking a negotiated peace.<br> Leo, it's 100 miles to Richmond.<br> Get him drunk so he can sleep.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Here, Daddy.<br> Oh.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Yes, sir, all right.<br> Where's my hat?<br> Leo has your hat.<br> All right?<br> Go make peace.<br> Thunder forth, God of War.<br> We'll commence our assault<br> on Wilmington from the sea.<br> Why is this burnt?<br> Was the boy playing with it?<br> It got took by a breeze<br> several nights back.<br> This is an official War Department map.<br> And the entire Cabinet's waiting<br> to hear what it portends.<br> A bombardment.<br> From the largest fleet<br> the Navy has ever assembled.<br> Old Neptune, shake thy hoary locks!<br> Fifty-eight ships are under way,<br> of every tonnage and firing range.<br> We'll keep up a steady barrage.<br> Our first target is Fort Fisher.<br> It defends Wilmington Port.<br> A steady barrage?<br> A hundred shells a minute.<br> Till they surrender.<br> - Dear God.<br> Wilmington's<br> their last open seaport, therefore...<br> Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after.<br> And the war is done.<br> Hear, hear!<br> Then why, if I might ask<br> are we not concentrating<br> the nation's attention on Wilmington?<br> Why, instead, are we<br> reading in the Herald<br> that the anti-slavery amendment<br> is being precipitated onto<br> the House floor for debate?<br> Because your eagerness,<br> in what seems an unwarranted intrusion<br> of the executive into<br> legislative prerogatives,<br> is compelling it to what's...<br> To what's likely to be<br> its premature demise.<br> Hear, hear!<br> You signed<br> the Emancipation Proclamation.<br> You've done all that could be done.<br> The Emancipation Proclamation's<br> merely a war measure.<br> After the war, the courts...<br> When Edward Bates<br> was Attorney General,<br> he felt confident enough<br> to let you sign it!<br> Different lawyers, different opinions.<br> It frees slaves<br> as a military exigent. Not...<br> I don't recall Edward Bates<br> being any too certain about<br> the legality of my proclamation.<br> Just it wasn't downright criminal.<br> Somewheres in between.<br> Mm.<br> Back when I rode<br> the legal circuit in Illinois,<br> I defended a woman from Metamora<br> named Melissa Goings.<br> Seventy-seven years old.<br> They said she'd murdered<br> her husband. He was 83.<br> He was choking her<br> and she grabbed ahold<br> of a stick of firewood<br> and fractured his skull and he died.<br> In his will, he wrote,<br> "I expect she has killed me."<br> "If I get over it, I will have revenge."<br> No one was keen to see her convicted,<br> he was that kind of husband.<br> I asked the prosecuting attorney<br> if I might have a short conference<br> with my client.<br> She and I went into a room<br> in the courthouse,<br> but I alone emerged.<br> The window in the room<br> was found to be wide open.<br> It was believed the old lady<br> may have climbed out of it.<br> I told the bailiff,<br> right before I left her in the room<br> she asked me where she could get<br> a good drink of water,<br> and I told her, Tennessee.<br> Mrs. Goings was seen no more<br> in Metamora.<br> Enough justice had been done.<br> They even forgave<br> the bondsman her bail.<br> I'm afraid I don't see...<br> I decided<br> that the Constitution<br> gives me war powers<br> but no one knows just exactly<br> what those powers are.<br> Some say they don't exist.<br> I don't know. I decided<br> I needed them to exist to uphold my oath<br> to protect the Constitution.<br> Which I decided meant I could take<br> the Rebels' slaves from them<br> as property confiscated in war.<br> That might recommend<br> to suspicion that I agree<br> with the Rebs that their slaves<br> are property in the first place.<br> Of course, I don't. Never have.<br> I'm glad to see any man free,<br> and if calling a man property<br> or war contraband<br> does the trick,<br> why I caught at the opportunity.<br> Now here's where it gets truly slippery.<br> I use the law allowing for the seizure<br> of property in a war<br> knowing it applies only to the property<br> of governments and citizens<br> of belligerent nations.<br> Well, the South ain't a nation.<br> That's why I can't negotiate with them.<br> So if, in fact, the Negroes are property,<br> according to the law,<br> have I the right to take<br> the Rebels' property<br> from them, if I insist they're rebels only<br> and not citizens of a belligerent country?<br> And slipperier still, I maintain it ain't<br> our actual Southern states in rebellion<br> but only the rebels living in those states,<br> the laws of which states remain in force.<br> "The laws of which states<br> remain in force."<br> That means that since it's<br> states' laws that determine<br> whether Negroes can be sold as slaves,<br> as property,<br> the federal government<br> doesn't have a say in that.<br> At least not yet.<br> Then Negroes in those states<br> are slaves,<br> hence property,<br> hence my war powers<br> allow me to confiscate them<br> as such, so I confiscate them.<br> But if I'm a respecter of states' laws,<br> how then can I legally free them<br> with my Proclamation as I done?<br> Unless I'm canceling states' laws?<br> I felt the war demanded it.<br> My oath demanded it.<br> I felt right with myself,<br> and I hoped it was legal to do it.<br> I'm hoping still.<br> Two years ago, I proclaimed<br> these people emancipated.<br> "Then, thenceforward and forever free."<br> Now let's say the courts<br> decide I had no authority<br> to do it. They might well decide that.<br> Say there's no amendment<br> abolishing slavery,<br> say it's after the war<br> and I can no longer use my war powers<br> to just ignore the courts' decisions<br> like I sometimes felt I had to do.<br> Might those people I freed<br> be ordered back into slavery?<br> That's why I'd like to get<br> the 13th Amendment through the House,<br> on its way to ratification by the states.<br> Wrap the whole slavery thing up,<br> forever and aye,<br> as soon as I'm able. Now!<br> End of this month.<br> And I'd like you to stand behind me<br> like my Cabinet's most always done.<br> As the preacher said,<br> "I could write shorter sermons,<br> but once I start, I get too lazy to stop."<br> It seems to me, sir, you're describing<br> precisely the sort of dictator<br> the Democrats<br> have been howling about.<br> Dictators<br> aren't susceptible to law.<br> Neither is he.<br> He just said as much.<br> Ignoring the courts?<br> Twisting meanings?<br> What reins him in from... From...<br> Well, the people do that, I suppose.<br> I signed the Emancipation Proclamation,<br> what, a year and a half<br> before my second election?<br> I felt I was within my power to do it,<br> however, I also felt that<br> I might be wrong about that.<br> I knew the people would tell me.<br> I gave them a year and a half<br> to think about it,<br> and they re-elected me.<br> And come February the first,<br> I intend to sign the 13th Amendment!<br> Well, Mr. Representative Ashley.<br> Tell us the news from the Hill.<br> Ah, well, the news...<br> Why, for instance, is this thus,<br> and what is the reason<br> for this thusness?<br> James, we want you to bring<br> the anti-slavery amendment<br> to the floor for debate,<br> - immediately.<br> - Excuse me, what?<br> You are the amendment's manager,<br> are you not?<br> I am, of course, but...<br> Then we're counting<br> on robust radical support<br> so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him<br> to put his back into it.<br> It's not going to be easy, but...<br> It's impossible.<br> No. I am sorry, no.<br> We can't organize anything<br> immediately in the House.<br> I have been canvassing the Democrats<br> since the election,<br> in case any of them have softened<br> after they got walloped, but<br> they have stiffened,<br> if anything, Mr. Secretary.<br> There aren't nearly enough votes.<br> We're Whalers, Mr. Ashley.<br> Whalers? As in, uh... Whales?<br> We've been chasing this whale<br> for a long time.<br> And we finally placed a harpoon<br> in the monster's back.<br> It's in, James. It's in.<br> We finish the deed now. We can't wait.<br> Or with one flop of his tail,<br> he'll smash the boat<br> and send us all to eternity.<br> On the 31st of this month, of this year,<br> put the amendment up for a vote.<br> Whalers?<br> That's what he said.<br> The man's never been near<br> a whale ship in his life.<br> Withdraw radical support.<br> Force him to abandon this scheme,<br> whatever he's up to.<br> He drags his feet<br> about everything,<br> Lincoln... Why this urgency?<br> We got it through the Senate<br> without difficulty<br> because we had the numbers.<br> Come December, you'll have<br> the same in the House.<br> The amendment will be<br> the easy work of 10 minutes.<br> He's using the threat of the amendment<br> to frighten the Rebels<br> into an immediate surrender.<br> I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.<br> Will you rejoice<br> when the Southern states<br> have rejoined the Union pell-mell,<br> as Lincoln intends them to,<br> and one by one,<br> each refuses to ratify the amendment?<br> If we pass it, which we won't.<br> Why are we cooperating with him?<br> We all know what he's doing<br> and we all know what he'll do.<br> We can't offer up abolition's<br> best legal prayer<br> to his games and tricks.<br> He said he'd welcome the South back<br> with all its slaves in chains.<br> Three years ago he said that,<br> to calm the border states.<br> I don't!<br> You said we all know<br> what he'll do. I don't know.<br> You know he isn't to be trusted.<br> Trust? Oh.<br> I'm sorry, I was under<br> the misapprehension<br> that your chosen profession was politics.<br> I never trusted the President,<br> never trusted anyone,<br> but hasn't he surprised you?<br> No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.<br> Nothing surprises you, Asa,<br> therefore nothing about you<br> is surprising.<br> Perhaps that is why your constituents<br> did not re-elect you to the coming term.<br> It's late.<br> I'm old.<br> I'm going home.<br> Lincoln, the inveterate dawdler.<br> Lincoln, the Southerner.<br> Lincoln, the capitulating compromiser,<br> our adversary, and<br> leader of the godforsaken<br> Republican party.<br> Our party.<br> Abraham Lincoln has asked us<br> to work with him<br> to accomplish the death<br> of slavery in America.<br> Retain, even in opposition<br> your capacity for astonishment.<br> The President is never<br> to be mentioned. Nor I.<br> You're paid for your discretion.<br> Hell, you can have that for nothing.<br> What we need money for<br> is bribes, to speed things up.<br> No, nothing strictly illegal.<br> It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen,<br> they'd starve otherwise.<br> I have explained to Mr. Bilbo<br> and Mr. Latham that<br> we are offering patronage jobs<br> to the Dems who vote yes.<br> - Jobs and nothing more.<br> - That's correct.<br> Congressmen come cheap.<br> Few thousand bucks<br> will buy you all you need.<br> The President would be unhappy<br> to hear you did that.<br> Will he be unhappy if we lose?<br> The money I managed to raise<br> for this endeavor<br> is only for your fees,<br> your food and lodging.<br> Uh-huh.<br> If that squirrel-infested attic<br> you've quartered us in is any measure,<br> you ain't raised much.<br> Shall we get to work?<br> The House recognizes Fernando Wood,<br> the honorable Representative<br> from New York.<br> Estimable colleagues.<br> Two bloody years ago this month<br> His Highness,<br> King Abraham Africanus the First,<br> our great usurping Caesar,<br> violator of habeas corpus<br> and freedom of the press,<br> abuser of states' rights...<br> If Lincoln really were a tyrant, Mr. Wood,<br> he'd have had your empty head<br> impaled on a pike!<br> And the country better for it!<br> Radical Republican autocrat,<br> ruling by fiat and martial law,<br> affixed his name to his heinous and illicit<br> Emancipation Proclamation<br> promising it would hasten<br> the end of the war,<br> which yet rages on and on.<br> He claimed, as tyrants do<br> that the war's emergencies<br> permitted him to turn our army into...<br> The New York delegation is<br> looking decidedly uninspired.<br> ...and radical Republicanism's<br> abolitionist fanaticism!<br> His Emancipation Proclamation<br> has obliterated millions of dollars...<br> Over in Pennsylvania,<br> who's the sweaty man eating his thumb?<br> Unknown to me.<br> Seems jumpy.<br> Perhaps he'll jump.<br> But all that was not enough<br> for this dictator,<br> who now seeks to insinuate...<br> Jesus.<br> When's this son of liberty<br> sum-a-bitch gonna sit down?<br> John Ellis is gonna break<br> his watch if he doesn't stop.<br> We are once again asked, nay<br> commanded, to consider<br> a proposed 13th Amendment<br> which, if passed,<br> shall set at immediate liberty<br> four million coloreds while manacling<br> the limbs of the white race in America.<br> If it is passed,<br> but it shall not pass!<br> What's more interesting<br> is how dismal and disgruntled<br> Mr. Yeaman appears.<br> Every member of this House...<br> He should be cheering right now.<br> Looks like he ate a bad oyster.<br> ...Party and<br> the constituents it serves<br> shall oppose...<br> Point of order,<br> Mr. Speaker, if you please.<br> Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor.<br> And the gentleman from Pennsylvania<br> is out of order!<br> When will Mr. Wood conclude<br> his interminable gabble?<br> Some of us breathe oxygen<br> and we find the mephitic<br> fumes of his oratory<br> a lethal challenge<br> to our pulmonary capabilities!<br> We shall oppose this amendment,<br> and any legislation that<br> so affronts natural law<br> insulting to God as to man!<br> Congress must never declare equal<br> those whom God created unequal!<br> Slavery is the only insult to natural law,<br> you fatuous nincompoop!<br> Order!<br> Procedure, Mr. Speaker.<br> Mr. Wood has the floor.<br> Instruct us,<br> oh, Great Commoner.<br> What is unnatural, in your opinion?<br> Niggrahs casting ballots?<br> Niggrah representatives?<br> Is that natural, Stevens?<br> Intermarriage?<br> What violates natural law?<br> Slavery and you.<br> Pendleton, you insult God!<br> You unnatural noise.<br> Mr. Colfax, please, use your gavel!<br> - You are out of order!<br> - Order in the Cabinet!<br> Instruct the Sergeant-at-Arms<br> to suppress this!<br> We are in session!<br> - Please don't encourage this!<br> Don't encourage this!<br> You're back!

Splendid.<br> And next, the Democrats will invite them<br> up to hearings on the Hill.<br> And the newspapers...<br> Oh, the newspapers.<br> The newspapers will ask,<br> "Why risk enraging the Confederacy<br> over the issue of slavery<br> when they're here to make peace?"<br> We'll lose every Democrat we've got,<br> more than likely<br> conservative Republicans<br> will join them, and all our work,<br> all our preparing the ground for the vote<br> laid waste for naught.<br> The Blairs promised support<br> for the amendment<br> if we listen to these people.<br> Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?<br> You think they'll keep their promise<br> once we've heard these delegates<br> and refused them,<br> which we will have to do,<br> since their proposal most certainly<br> will be predicated on<br> keeping their slaves!<br> What hope for<br> any Democratic votes, Willum,<br> if word gets out that<br> I've refused a chance<br> to end the war?<br> You think word won't get out?<br> In Washington?<br> It's either the amendment<br> or this Confederate peace.<br> You cannot have both.<br> "If you can look into the seeds of time,"<br> "And say which grain will grow<br> and which will not,"<br> "Speak then to me."<br> A disaster.

It's a new year now<br> and we are all getting along,<br> or so they tell me.<br> I gather we are working together.<br> The White House and the other House,<br> hatching little plans together.<br> - Mother.<br> - What?<br> - You're creating a bottleneck.<br> - Oh.<br> Oh, I'm detaining you.<br> And more importantly,<br> the people behind you.<br> How the people love my husband.<br> They flock to see him by<br> their thousands on public days.<br> They will never love you<br> the way they love him.<br> How difficult it must be<br> for you to know that<br> and yet how important to remember it.<br> Since we have the floor<br> next in the debate,<br> I thought I'd suggest you might<br> temper your contribution<br> so as not to frighten<br> our conservative friends.<br> Ashley insists you're ensuring approval<br> by dispensing patronage<br> to otherwise undeserving Democrats.<br> I can't ensure a single damn thing<br> if you scare the whole House silly<br> with talk of land appropriations<br> and revolutionary tribunals.<br> When the war ends, I intend to<br> push for full equality,<br> the Negro vote, and much more.<br> Congress shall mandate the seizure<br> of every foot of Rebel land<br> and every dollar of their property.<br> We'll use their confiscated wealth<br> to establish hundreds of thousands<br> of free Negro farmers<br> and, at their side,<br> soldiers armed to occupy<br> and transform the heritage of traitors.<br> We'll build up a land down there<br> of free men and free women<br> and free children and freedom.<br> The nation needs to know<br> that we have such plans.<br> That's the untempered version<br> of reconstruction.<br> It is not...<br> It's not quite exactly what I intend.<br> But we shall oppose one another<br> in the course of time.<br> Now we're working together,<br> and I'm asking you...<br> For patience, I expect.<br> When the people disagree,<br> bringing them together<br> requires going slow<br> until they're ready to...<br> Shit on the people and what they want<br> and what they're ready for.<br> I don't give a goddamn about the people<br> and what they want.<br> This is the face of someone<br> who has fought long and hard<br> for the good of the people<br> without caring much for any of them.<br> And I look a lot worse without my wig.<br> The people elected me<br> to represent them,<br> to lead them, and I lead.<br> You ought to try it.<br> I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens<br> and I have tried to profit<br> from the example of it, but<br> if I'd listened to you,<br> I'd have declared every slave free<br> the minute the first shell<br> struck Fort Sumter.<br> And the border states<br> would have gone over<br> to the Confederacy,<br> the war would have been lost<br> and the Union along with it,<br> and instead of abolishing slavery<br> as we hope to do in two weeks,<br> we'd be watching,<br> helpless as infants, as it spread<br> from the American South<br> into South America.<br> Oh, how you have longed<br> to say that to me.<br> You claim you trust them,<br> but you know what the people are.<br> You know that the inner compass,<br> that should direct the soul<br> towards justice<br> has ossified in white men<br> and women, North and South,<br> unto utter uselessness,<br> through tolerating the evil of slavery.<br> White people cannot bear the thought<br> of sharing this country's<br> infinite abundance<br> with Negroes.<br> A compass, I learned<br> when I was surveying,<br> it'll point you true north<br> from where you're standing.<br> But it's got no advice about<br> the swamps and deserts and chasms<br> that you'll encounter along the way.<br> If in pursuit of your destination,<br> you plunge ahead,<br> heedless of obstacles<br> and achieve nothing more<br> than to sink in a swamp,<br> what's the use of knowing true north?<br> Robert's going to plead<br> with us to let him enlist.<br> Make time to talk to Robbie.<br> You only have time for Tad.<br> Tad is young.<br> So is Robert. Too young for the Army.<br> Plenty of boys younger<br> than Robert signing up.<br> Don't take Robbie.<br> Don't let me lose my son.<br> Go away! We're occupied!<br> Secretary Stanton has sent over<br> to tell you that as of half an hour ago<br> the shelling of Wilmington Harbor<br> has commenced.<br> They cannot possibly maintain<br> under this kind of an assault.<br> Terry has got 10,000 men<br> surrounding the goddamn port.<br> Why doesn't he answer...<br> Fort Fisher is a mountain<br> of a building, Edwin.<br> It's the largest fort they have, sir.<br> Twenty-two big Seacoast guns<br> on each rampart.<br> They've been reinforcing it<br> for the last two years.<br> They've taken 17,000 shells<br> since yesterday!<br> I want to hear Fort Fisher is ours<br> and Wilmington has fallen.<br> Send another damn cable!<br> The problem's their<br> commander, Whiting!<br> He engineered the fortress himself,<br> the damn thing's his child.<br> He'll defend it till<br> his every last man is gone.<br> "Come on out, you old rat!"<br> That's<br> what Ethan Allen called out<br> to the commander<br> of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776.<br> "Come on out, you old rat!"<br> Of course, there were only<br> There is one Ethan Allen story<br> that I'm very partial to.<br> No, you're going to tell a story.<br> I don't believe that I can bear<br> to listen to another one<br> of your stories right now.<br> I need the B&O sideyard<br> schedules for Alexandria!<br> I asked for them this morning!<br> It was<br> right after the Revolution,<br> right after peace had been concluded.<br> And Ethan Allen went to London<br> to help our new country<br> conduct its business with the King.<br> The English sneered<br> at how rough we are<br> and rude and simple-minded,<br> and on like that,<br> everywhere he went<br> till one day he was invited<br> to the townhouse<br> of a great English lord.<br> Dinner was served<br> and beverages imbibed,<br> time passed, as happens, and<br> Mr. Allen found he needed the privy.<br> He was grateful to be directed thence.<br> - Relieved, you might say.<br> Now, Mr. Allen discovered<br> on entering the water closet,<br> that the only decoration therein<br> was a portrait of George Washington.<br> Was a portrait of George Washington.<br> Ethan Allen done what he came to do,<br> and returned to the drawing room.<br> His host and the others<br> were disappointed<br> when he didn't mention<br> Washington's portrait.<br> Finally, His Lordship couldn't<br> resist and asked Mr. Allen<br> had he noticed it,<br> the picture of Washington.<br> He had.<br> Well, what did he think of its placement,<br> did it seem appropriately<br> located to Mr. Allen?<br> Mr. Allen said it did.<br> His host was astounded.<br> "Appropriate?"<br> "George Washington's likeness<br> in a water closet?"<br> "Yes," said Mr. Allen.<br> "Where it'll do good service.<br> "The whole world knows nothing<br> will make an Englishman<br> shit quicker than the sight<br> of George Washington."<br> I love that story.<br> Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken the port.<br> And Wilmington?<br> We've taken the fort,<br> but the city of Wilmington<br> has not surrendered.<br> How many casualties?<br> - Heavy losses.<br> - And more to come.<br> It sours the national mood.<br> It might suffice...<br> To what? To bring this down?<br> Not in a fight like this.<br> This is to the death.<br> That's gruesome.<br> Are you despairing or merely lazy?<br> This fight is for<br> the United States of America.<br> Nothing "suffices." A rumor? Nothing.<br> They're not lazy.<br> They're busily buying votes<br> while we hope to be saved<br> by "the national mood"?<br> Before this blood is dry, when<br> Stevens next takes the floor,<br> taunt him. You excel at that.<br> Get him to proclaim what<br> we all know he believes<br> in his coal-colored heart.<br> That this vote is meant<br> to set the black race on high,<br> to niggerate America...<br> George, please, stay on course.<br> Bring Stevens to full froth.<br> I can ensure that every newspaperman<br> from Louisville to San Francisco<br> will be here to witness it and print it.<br> The floor belongs to<br> the mellifluent gentleman<br> from Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.<br> I thank you, Speaker Colfax.<br> Although I am disgusted by slavery,<br> I rise on this sad and solemn day<br> to announce that<br> I'm opposed to the amendment.<br> We must consider what<br> will become of colored folk<br> if four million are, in one instant, set free.<br> They'll be free, George,<br> that's what will become of them.<br> Think how splendid<br> if Mr. Yeaman switched.<br> Too publicly against us.<br> He can't change course now.<br> Not for some miserable<br> little job, anyways.<br> And we will be forced to enfranchise<br> the men of the colored race.<br> It would be inhuman not to.<br> Now who among us is prepared<br> to give Negroes the vote?<br> And, and,<br> what shall follow upon that?<br> Universal enfranchisement?<br> Votes for women?<br> We...<br> Bless my eyes.<br> If it isn't the Postmaster<br> of Millersburg, Ohio.<br> Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound<br> to inform us<br> of your disgusting betrayal.<br> Your prostitution.<br> Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?<br> Is your maidenly virtue for sale?<br> Is your maidenly virtue for sale?<br> If my neighbors hear<br> that I voted yes for nigger freedom<br> and no to peace, they will kill me.<br> A deal is a deal.<br> You men know better<br> than to piss your pants<br> just 'cause there's talk<br> about peace talks.<br> - Look, I'll find another job!<br> - My neighbors in Nashville,<br> they found out I was loyal to the Union,<br> they came after me with gelding knives.<br> - I'll find another job.<br> - You do right, Clay Hawkins.<br> I want to do right! But I got no courage!<br> Wait. You wanted...<br> What was it?<br> A tax man for the Western Reserve?<br> Hell, you can have the whole<br> state of Ohio if you want...<br> Oh, crap.<br> Eleven votes?<br> Two days ago, we had twelve.<br> What happened?<br> There are defections in the ranks.<br> It's the goddamn rumors<br> regarding the Richmond delegation.<br> - Yes. The peace offer.<br> - Groundless.<br> - And yet the rumors persist.<br> - They are ruining us.<br> Among the few<br> remaining Representatives<br> who seem remotely plausible,<br> there is a perceptible<br> increase in resistance.<br> Resistance, hell.<br> Thingamabob Hollister,<br> Dem from Indiana.<br> I approached him,<br> sumbitch near to murdered me.<br> Colorado Territory... What's this one?<br> Job description... Taxpayers and...<br> Oh, shit! Cracky!<br> Fuck you, you son of a bitch! Goddamn!<br> - Perhaps you pushed too hard.<br> - I push nobody.<br> Perhaps we need reinforcements.<br> If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities,<br> who do you think is going to<br> give a genuine solid shit<br> to free slaves?<br> Get back to it.<br> And gentlemen, good day.<br> We are at an impasse.<br> Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors, publicly.<br> Tell us what you expect of us.<br> I expect you to do your work.<br> And have sufficient sense and taste<br> not to presume to instruct the President.<br> Or me.<br> Is there a Confederate offer, or not?<br> Gentlemen.<br> I suggest you work some changes<br> to your proposal<br> before you give it to the President.<br> We're eager to be on our way<br> to Washington.<br> Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this?<br> It says "securing peace<br> for our two countries"<br> and it goes on like that.<br> - I don't...<br> - There is just one country.<br> You and I, we're citizens of that country.<br> I'm fighting to protect it<br> from armed rebels.<br> From you.<br> But Mr. Blair, he told us,<br> he told President<br> Jefferson Davis that we...<br> A private citizen like Preston Blair<br> can say what he pleases,<br> since he has no authority over anything.<br> If you want to discuss peace<br> with President Lincoln,<br> consider revisions.<br> If we're not to discuss<br> a truce between warring nations,<br> what in heaven's name can we discuss?<br> Terms of surrender.<br> "Office United States<br> Military Telegraph,<br> "War Department."<br> "For Abraham Lincoln,<br> President of the United States."<br> January 20, 1865.<br> "I will state confidentially<br> that I am convinced<br> upon conversation<br> with these commissioners<br> that their intentions are good<br> and their desire sincere<br> to restore peace and union."<br> "I fear now they're going back<br> without any expression<br> of interest from anyone<br> in authority, Mr. Lincoln,<br> will have a bad influence."<br> "I will be sorry should<br> it prove impossible for you<br> to have an interview with them."<br> "I am awaiting your instructions."<br> "U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General,<br> Commanding Armies, United States."<br> After four years of war, and<br> near 600,000 lives lost,<br> he believes we can end this war now.<br> My trust in him is marrow deep.<br> You could bring the delegates<br> to Washington.<br> In exchange for the South's<br> immediate surrender,<br> we could promise them<br> the amendment's defeat.<br> They'd agree, don't you think?<br> We'd end the war. This week.<br> Or, if you could manage<br> without seeming to do it, to, uh...<br> The peace delegation<br> might encounter delays<br> as they travel up the James River.<br> Particularly with the fighting<br> around Wilmington.<br> Within ten days' time,<br> we might pass the 13th Amendment.<br> Here's a 16-year-old boy,<br> they're going to hang him.<br> He's with the Fifteenth<br> Indiana Cavalry near Bulford.<br> It seems he lamed his horse<br> to avoid battle.<br> I don't think even Stanton<br> would complain<br> if I pardoned him.<br> You think Stanton would complain?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> I don't know who you're, uh...<br> - What time is it?<br> - It's 3:40 in the morning.<br> Don't let him pardon any more deserters.<br> Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many.<br> He's generally apoplectic on the subject.<br> He oughtn't have done that,<br> crippled his horse.<br> That was cruel, but you don't just hang<br> a 16-year-old boy for that...<br> Ask the horse what he thinks.<br> ...for cruelty. There'd be<br> no 16-year-old boys left.<br> Grant wants me to bring<br> the secesh delegates<br> to Washington.<br> So there are secesh delegates?<br> He was afraid, that's all it was.<br> I don't care to hang a boy<br> for being frightened, either.<br> What good would it do him?<br> War's nearly done, ain't that so?<br> What use is one more corpse?<br> Any more corpses?<br> Do you need company?<br> In times like this,<br> I'm best alone.<br> "Lieutenant General<br> Ulysses S.

Fitted.<br> What do you reckon?<br> Well, I'm an engineer.<br> I reckon there's machinery,<br> but no one's done the fitting.<br> You're an engineer.<br> You must know Euclid's axioms<br> and common notions.<br> I must have in school, but...<br> I never had much of schooling,<br> but I read Euclid<br> in an old book I borrowed.<br> Little enough ever found its way in here,<br> but once learnt, it stayed learnt.<br> Euclid's first common notion is this,<br> "Things which are equal<br> to the same thing<br> are equal to each other."<br> That's a rule of mathematical reasoning.<br> It's true because it works.<br> Has done and always will do.<br> In his book, mmm,<br> Euclid says this is "self-evident."<br> You see? There it is,<br> even in that 2,000-year-old book<br> of mechanical law.<br> It is a self-evident truth<br> that things which are equal<br> to the same thing<br> are equal to each other.<br> We begin with equality.<br> That's the origin, isn't it?<br> That's balance. That's... That's fairness.<br> That's justice.<br> Just read me back the last sentence<br> of the telegram, please.<br> "Have Captain Saunders convey<br> the commissioners to me<br> here in Washington."<br> A slight emendation,<br> if you would, Sam.<br> "Have Captain Saunders<br> convey the gentlemen<br> aboard the River Queen<br> as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia,<br> and there wait until<br> further advice from me."<br> "Do not proceed to Washington."<br> The World, the Herald,<br> the Times,<br> New York, Chicago,<br> the Journal of Commerce,<br> even your hometown paper's here.<br> Say you believe only in<br> legal equality for all races,<br> not racial equality.<br> I beg you, sir.<br> Compromise. Or you risk it all.<br> I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens,<br> and you must answer me.<br> Do you or do you not<br> hold that the precept<br> that "All men are created equal"<br> is meant literally?<br> Is that not the true purpose<br> of the amendment?<br> To promote your ultimate<br> and ardent dream to elevate...<br> The true purpose<br> of the amendment, Mr. Wood,<br> you perfectly named,<br> brainless obstructive object...<br> Now you have always insisted,<br> Mr. Stevens,<br> that Negroes are the same<br> as white men are.<br> The true purpose of the amendment...<br> I don't hold with equality in all things,<br> only with equality before the law.<br> Nothing more.<br> That's... That's not so.<br> You believe that Negroes are<br> entirely equal to white men.<br> You've said it a thousand times!<br> For shame! For shame!<br> Stop prevaricating and<br> answer Representative Wood!<br> I don't hold with equality in all things,<br> only with equality before the law.<br> After the decades of fervent advocacy...<br> He's answered your questions!<br> This amendment's<br> not to do with race equality.<br> I don't hold with equality in all things,<br> only with equality before<br> the law, and nothing more!<br> Who'd ever have guessed<br> that old nightmare<br> capable of such control?<br> He might make a politician someday.<br> I need to go.<br> Mrs. Keckley.<br> Your frantic attempt to delude us now<br> is unworthy of a representative.<br> It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man!<br> How can I hold that<br> all men are created equal<br> when here before me stands, stinking,<br> the moral carcass of<br> the gentleman from Ohio, proof<br> that some men are inferior,<br> endowed by their Maker with dim wits,<br> impermeable to reason,<br> with cold, pallid slime in their veins<br> instead of hot, red blood!<br> You are more reptile than man, George!<br> So low and flat that the foot of man<br> is incapable of crushing you.<br> How dare you?<br> Yet even you, Pendleton,<br> who should have been<br> gibbeted for treason<br> long before today.<br> Even worthless, unworthy you<br> ought to be treated equally<br> before the law!<br> And so again, sir, again<br> and again and again I say,<br> I do not hold with equality in all things,<br> only with equality before the law.<br> Mr. Speaker, will you permit<br> this vile, boorish man<br> to slander and to threaten me?<br> And to reduce these proceedings<br> on this most important matter<br> into an anarchic<br> and tawdry burlesque?<br> You asked if ever I was surprised.<br> Today, Mr. Stevens,<br> I was surprised.<br> You've led the battle for<br> race equality for 30 years.<br> The basis of every hope for<br> this country's future life,<br> you denied Negro equality.<br> I'm nauseated.<br> You refused to say that all humans are...<br> Well, human.<br> Have you lost your very soul,<br> Mr. Stevens?<br> Is there nothing you won't say?<br> I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa.<br> That must be unpleasant.<br> I want the amendment to pass,<br> so that the Constitution's first<br> and only mention of slavery<br> is its absolute prohibition.<br> For this amendment, for which<br> I have worked all my life<br> and for which countless<br> colored men and women<br> have fought and died<br> and now hundreds<br> of thousands of soldiers...<br> No, sir, no.<br> It seems there's very nearly<br> nothing I won't say.<br> I'm not going in.<br> You said you wanted to help me.<br> But this is just a clumsy attempt<br> to discourage me.<br> I've been to Army hospitals.<br> I've seen surgeries.<br> I went and visited<br> the malaria barges with Mama.<br> She told me she didn't take you inside.<br> I snuck in afterwards.<br> I've seen what it's like.<br> This changes nothing.<br> Well, at all rate, son,<br> I'm happy to have your company.<br> - Good morning, Jim.<br> - Hello, Mr. President.<br> - Good to see you again.<br> - Good to see you.<br> Well, boys, first question.<br> You getting enough to eat?<br> Hello, sir.<br> - What's your name, soldier?<br> - Robert.<br> - Good to meet you, Robert.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Kevin.<br> Tell me your names as I go past.<br> I'd like to know who I'm talking to. Kevin.<br> - Mr. President. John.<br> - John. I've seen you before.<br> Mr. President.<br> Make sure you get some steak.<br> I wouldn't mind one myself, right now.<br> What's the matter, Bob?<br> I have to do this, and I will do it.<br> And I don't need<br> your permission to enlist.<br> That same speech has been made<br> by how many sons<br> to how many fathers<br> since the war began?<br> "I don't need your damn permission,<br> you miserable old goat,<br> I'm gonna enlist anyhow."<br> And what wouldn't those<br> numberless fathers have given<br> to be able to say to their sons<br> as I now say to mine,<br> "I'm Commander in Chief."<br> So, in point of fact,<br> without my permission<br> you ain't enlisting<br> in nothing nowhere, young man.<br> It's Mama you're scared of,<br> it's not me getting killed.<br> I have to do this! And I will!<br> Or I will feel ashamed of myself<br> for the rest of my life!<br> Whether or not you fought<br> is what's gonna matter,<br> and not just to other people,<br> but to myself!<br> I won't be you, Pa, I can't do that,<br> but I don't want to be nothing!<br> I can't lose you.<br> He'll be fine, Molly.<br> City Point's a way back<br> from the front lines<br> and the fighting.<br> He'll be an adjutant, running<br> messages for General Grant.<br> The war will take our son.<br> A sniper, or a shrapnel shell, a typhus<br> same as took Willie.<br> It takes hundreds of boys a day.<br> He'll die uselessly.<br> And how will I ever forgive you?<br> Most men, their firstborn is their favorite.<br> You've always blamed Robert<br> for being born.<br> For trapping you in a marriage<br> that's only ever given you grief<br> - and caused you regret.<br> - That's simply not true.<br> And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor's<br> on your hands same as Grant,<br> God help us.<br> We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood<br> you've sanctioned,<br> the uncountable corpses!<br> We'll be made to pay<br> with our son's dear blood!<br> Just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,<br> I demand of you to try<br> and take the liberal<br> and not the selfish point of view.<br> Robert will never forgive himself.<br> You imagine he'll forgive us<br> if we continue to stifle<br> this very natural ambition?<br> And if I refuse to take the high road?<br> If I won't pick up the rough old cross,<br> will you threaten me again<br> with the madhouse?<br> As you did when I couldn't<br> stop crying over Willie.<br> When I showed you what heartbreak,<br> real heartbreak, looked like.<br> And you hadn't the courage<br> - to countenance, to help me!<br> - That's right, that's right...<br> When you refused so much<br> as to comfort Tad,<br> a child who was not only sick,<br> dangerously sick,<br> but beside himself with grief!<br> I was holding him in my arms<br> when he died.<br> But your grief, your grief,<br> your inexhaustible grief!<br> How dare you throw that up at me?<br> And his mother wouldn't let him near her<br> because she's screaming<br> from morning to night!<br> I couldn't risk him<br> seeing how angry I was!<br> Pacing the halls, howling at shadows<br> and furniture and ghosts!<br> I ought to have done it for Tad's sake,<br> for everybody's goddamn sake,<br> I should have clapped you<br> in the madhouse!<br> Then do it!<br> Do it! Don't you threaten me!<br> You do it this time. Lock me away.<br> You'll have to, I swear,<br> if Robert is killed.<br> I couldn't tolerate you<br> grieving so for Willie<br> because I couldn't permit it in myself.<br> Though I wanted to, Mary.<br> I wanted to crawl under the earth,<br> into the vault, with his coffin.<br> And I still do. Every day I do.<br> Don't speak to me about grief.<br> I must make my decisions,<br> Bob must make his, you yours.<br> And bear what we must.<br> Hold and carry what we must.<br> What I carry within me,<br> you must allow me to do it.<br> Alone, as I must. And you alone, Mary,<br> you alone may lighten this burden.<br> Or render it intolerable.<br> As you choose.<br> You think I'm ignorant<br> of what you're up to<br> because you haven't discussed<br> this scheme with me<br> as you ought to have done?<br> When have I ever been<br> so easily bamboozled?<br> I believe you when you insist<br> that amending the Constitution<br> and abolishing slavery will end this war.<br> And since you are<br> sending my son into the war,<br> woe unto you if you fail<br> to pass the amendment.<br> Seward doesn't want me<br> leaving big muddy footprints<br> all over town.<br> No one has ever lived<br> who knows better than you<br> the proper placement of footfalls<br> on treacherous paths.<br> Seward can't do it. You must.<br> Because if you fail to acquire<br> the necessary votes,<br> woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me.<br> Thank you.<br> I know the vote is only four days away.<br> I know you're concerned.<br> Thank you for your concern over this.<br> And I want you to know,<br> they'll approve it.<br> God will see to it.<br> I don't envy Him his task.<br> He may wish He'd chosen<br> an instrument for His purpose<br> more wieldy than<br> the House of Representatives.<br> Then you'll see to it.<br> Are you afraid of what<br> lies ahead for your people<br> if we succeed?<br> White people don't want us here.<br> - Many don't.<br> - What about you?<br> I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.<br> Any of you.<br> You're familiar to me, as all people are,<br> unaccommodated, poor, bare,<br> forked creatures,<br> such as we all are.<br> You have a right to expect what I expect.<br> And likely our expectations<br> are not incomprehensible to each other.<br> I assume I'll get used to you.<br> Now what you are to the nation,<br> what'll become of you<br> once slavery's day is done,<br> I don't know.<br> What my people are to be, I can't say.<br> Negroes have been fighting<br> and dying for freedom<br> since the first of us was a slave.<br> I never heard any ask<br> what freedom would bring.<br> Freedom is first.<br> As for me,<br> my son died fighting for the Union,<br> wearing the Union blue.<br> For freedom he died.<br> And I'm his mother.<br> That's what I am<br> to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.<br> What else must I be?<br> My whole hand's gonna be proud<br> in about five seconds.<br> Let's see how proud you can be.<br> Go away. That watch fob, is that gold?<br> You keep your eyes off my fob.<br> Gentlemen, you have a visitor.<br> - Goddamn!<br> - Hey, Bill.<br> Well, I'll be fucked.<br> I wouldn't bet against it.<br> Mr, uh?<br> W. N. Bilbo.<br> Yeah, Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.<br> Sir.<br> Why are you here? No offense,<br> but Mr. Seward's banished<br> the very mention of your name.<br> He won't even let us use fifty cent pieces<br> 'cause they've got your face on 'em.<br> The Secretary of State here<br> tells me that you got<br> That's encouraging.<br> Oh, you've got no cause<br> to be encouraged, sir.<br> Are we being fired?<br> "We have heard the chimes<br> at midnight, Master Shallow."<br> I'm here to alert you boys<br> that the great day of reckoning<br> is nigh upon us.<br> The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir,<br> the patronage jobs simply won't bag 'em.<br> They require more convincing,<br> Mr. President.<br> Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, will you?<br> Sure.<br> It snagged my eye<br> in the paper this morning<br> that the Governor Curtin<br> is set to declare a winner in the disputed<br> Congressional election for the...<br> Pennsylvania 16th District.<br> District.<br> What a joy to be comprehended.<br> Hop on a train to Philadel,<br> call on the Governor...<br> Send Latham. Or Schell.<br> No, he'll do fine.<br> Just polish yourself up first.<br> The incumbent is claiming<br> he won it. Name of...<br> Coffroth.<br> - That's him.<br> - Coffroth.<br> - He's a Democrat.<br> - I understand that.<br> - Silly name.<br> - A little bit silly.<br> Uh, tell Governor Curtin<br> it'd be much appreciated<br> if he'd invite<br> the House of Representatives<br> to decide who won.<br> He's entitled to do that. He'll agree to it.<br> Then advise Coffroth<br> if he hopes to retain his seat,<br> then he'd better pay a visit<br> to Thaddeus Stevens.<br> Well, pity poor Coffroth.<br> It opens!<br> You are Canfrey?<br> Coffroth, Mr. Stevens.<br> Alexander Coffroth.<br> Are we representatives<br> of the same state?<br> Yes, sir.<br> We sit only three desks apart.<br> I haven't noticed you.<br> I'm a Republican and you,<br> Coughdrop, are a Democrat?<br> Well, uh, I, um,<br> that is to say...<br> The modern travesty<br> of Thomas Jefferson's<br> political organization<br> to which you've attached<br> yourself like a barnacle<br> has the effrontery to call<br> itself the Democratic Party.<br> You are a Democrat.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Are you wicked?<br> - Well, I felt...<br> - Never mind.<br> Coff snot, you were<br> ignominiously trounced<br> at the hustings in November's election<br> by your worthy challenger,<br> a Republican.<br> No, sir, I was not trounced.<br> He wants to steal my seat.<br> I didn't lose the election.<br> What difference does it make<br> if you lost or not?<br> The governor of our state<br> is... A Democrat?<br> No, he's, he's a...<br> Re...<br> Re...<br> - ...pub... lic...<br> - ...pub... lic...<br> - ...can.<br> - ...can. Republican.<br> I know what he is.<br> This is a rhetorical exercise.<br> And Congress is controlled<br> by what party? Yours?<br> Your party was beaten.<br> Your challenger's party<br> now controls the House<br> and hence the House<br> Committee on Elections,<br> so you have been beaten.<br> You shall shortly be sent home<br> in disgrace. Unless...<br> I know what I must do, sir.<br> I will immediately become<br> a Republican and vote yes...<br> No!<br> Coffroth will vote yes,<br> but Coffroth will remain a Democrat<br> until after he does so.<br> Why wait to switch? I'm happy to...<br> We want to show the amendment<br> has bipartisan support,<br> you idiot. Early in the next Congress,<br> when I tell you to do so,<br> you will switch parties.<br> Now congratulations<br> on your victory, and get out.<br> Now, give me the names<br> of whoever else you've been hunting.<br> Aw, hell.<br> George Yeaman.<br> Yes. Yeaman.<br> Among others.<br> - But Yeaman, that'd count.<br> - Yeah.<br> Y-E-A-M-A-N.<br> I got it.<br> Kentucky.<br> I can't vote for<br> the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.<br> I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,<br> filled with colored men in chains<br> heading down the Mississippi<br> to the New Orleans slave markets.<br> It sickened me.<br> And more than that,<br> it brought a shadow down.<br> A pall around my eyes.<br> Slavery troubled me<br> as long as I can remember<br> in a way it never troubled my father,<br> though he hated it, in his own fashion.<br> He knew no smallholding dirt farmer<br> could compete with slave plantations<br> so he took us out from Kentucky<br> to get away from 'em.<br> He wanted Indiana kept free.<br> He wasn't a kind man<br> but there was a rough,<br> moral urge for fairness,<br> for freedom in him.<br> I learnt that from him, I suppose.<br> If little else from him.<br> We didn't care<br> for one another, Mr. Yeaman.<br> Well, I'm sorry to hear that.<br> Loving kindness, that most<br> ordinary thing, came to me<br> from other sources. I'm grateful for that.<br> Well, I hate it, too, sir.<br> Slavery, but...<br> But we're entirely unready<br> for emancipation.<br> And there's too many questions...<br> We're unready for peace, too, ain't we?<br> Yeah, when it comes,<br> it'll present us with conundrums<br> and dangers greater than<br> any we faced during the war,<br> bloody as it's been.<br> We'll have to extemporize and<br> experiment with what it is,<br> when it is.<br> I read your speech, George.<br> Negroes and the vote,<br> that's a puzzle.<br> No, no. But, but, but Negroes can't<br> uh, vote, Mr. Lincoln.<br> You're not suggesting<br> we enfranchise colored people?<br> I'm asking only that<br> you disenthrall yourself<br> from the slave powers.<br> I'll let you know when<br> there's an offer on my desk<br> for surrender.<br> There's none before us now.<br> What's before us now,<br> that's the vote on the 13th Amendment.<br> And it's going to be so very close.<br> You see what you can do.<br> I can't make sense of it.<br> What he died for.<br> Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all.<br> I do. All black people.<br> I am a prejudiced man.<br> Well, I'd change that in you if I could,<br> but that's not why I come.<br> I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton,<br> but I expect colored people<br> most likely be free.<br> And when that's so, it's simple truth<br> that your brother's bravery<br> and his death helped make it so.<br> Only you can decide whether<br> that's sense enough for you or not.<br> My deepest sympathies to your family.<br> We've managed our members<br> to a fare-thee-well.<br> You've had no defections<br> from the Republican right to trouble you.<br> Whereas as to what you promised,<br> where the hell are the commissioners?<br> Oh, my God. It's true.<br> You... You lied to me.<br> Mr. Lincoln, you evaded<br> my request for a denial<br> that there is a Confederate peace offer,<br> because there is one!<br> We are absolutely guaranteed<br> to lose the whole thing.<br> We don't need a goddamn<br> abolition amendment!<br> Leave the Constitution alone!<br> What if the peace commissioners<br> appear today, or worse...<br> I can't listen to this anymore.<br> I can't accomplish a goddamn thing<br> of any human meaning or worth<br> until we cure ourselves of slavery<br> and end this pestilential war!<br> And whether any of you<br> or anyone else knows it,<br> I know I need this!<br> This amendment is that cure!<br> We are stepped out upon<br> the world stage now!<br> Now!<br> With the fate of human dignity<br> in our hands!<br> Blood's been spilt to<br> afford us this moment!<br> Now! Now! Now!<br> And you grousle and heckle<br> and dodge about like<br> pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters!<br> See what is before you.<br> See the here and now, that's the<br> hardest thing,<br> the only thing that accounts.<br> Abolishing slavery<br> by constitutional provision<br> settles the fate for all coming time<br> not only of the millions now in bondage<br> but of unborn millions to come.<br> Two votes stand in its way.<br> These votes must be procured.<br> We need two yeses,<br> three abstentions, or<br> four yeses<br> and one more abstention,<br> and the amendment will pass.<br> You got a night, and a day, and a night,<br> and several perfectly good hours.<br> Now get the hell out of here and get 'em.<br> Yes. But how?<br> Buzzards' guts, man.<br> I am the President of the<br> United States of America<br> clothed in immense power.<br> You will procure me these votes.<br> We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen,<br> first in the history of<br> this people's chamber,<br> to your House.<br> Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.<br> On the matter of the<br> joint resolution before us,<br> presenting a 13th Amendment<br> to our National Constitution,<br> which was passed last year<br> by the Senate<br> and which has been debated now<br> by this estimable body<br> for the past several weeks,<br> today we will vote.<br> By mutual agreement,<br> we shall hear brief, final statements,<br> beginning with<br> the honorable<br> George Pendleton of Ohio.<br> I have just received<br> confirmation<br> of what previously has<br> been merely rumored.<br> Affidavits from loyal citizens<br> recently returned from Richmond.<br> They testify that<br> commissioners have indeed<br> come north and ought to have arrived<br> by now in Washington City<br> bearing an offer of immediate cessation<br> of our civil war.<br> Is it true, sir?<br> Are there Confederate<br> commissioners in the capital?<br> I have no idea where they are<br> or if they've arrived.<br> They'll arrive.<br> I appeal to<br> my fellow Democrats,<br> to all Republican representatives<br> who give a fig for peace,<br> postpone this vote!<br> Until we have answers<br> from the President himself!<br> Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote!<br> - Postpone the vote!<br> - Gentlemen!<br> Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!<br> Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!<br> I have made a motion!<br> Does anyone care to second my motion?<br> Gentlemen.<br> The conservative faction<br> of border and western Republicans<br> cannot approve this amendment,<br> about which we harbor grave doubts,<br> if a peace offer is being<br> held hostage to its success.<br> Joining together with<br> our Democratic colleagues,<br> I second the motion<br> to postpone.<br> He must deny peace<br> commissioners are in the city.<br> Quick, man. Quick.<br> This is precisely<br> what Mr. Wood wishes me<br> to respond to?<br> Word for word, this is precisely<br> the assurance that he demands of me?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Give this to Mr. Ashley.<br> Uh, I feel I have to say,<br> Mr. Lincoln, that...<br> Could you please just step outside?<br> You want to have a chat now,<br> with the whole of the<br> House of Representatives<br> waiting on this?<br> Making false representation<br> to Congress, is...<br> - It's...<br> - It's impeachable,<br> but I've made no such<br> false representation.<br> But there are.<br> There is a delegation from Richmond.<br> Give me the note, Johnnie.<br> Please, deliver that to Mr. Ashley.<br> From the President.<br> "So far as I know, there are no<br> peace commissioners in the city<br> nor are there likely to be."<br> "So far as I know"?<br> That means nothing.<br> Are there commissioners from<br> the South, or aren't there?<br> The President<br> has answered you, sir.<br> Your peace offer is a fiction.<br> That is not a denial.<br> It is a lawyer's dodge!<br> Mr. Haddam, is your faction satisfied?<br> The conservative Republican<br> faction is satisfied.<br> And we thank Mr. Lincoln.<br> I move to table Mr. Wood's motion.<br> Tabled!<br> Mr. Colfax, I order the main question.<br> A motion has been made to bring the bill<br> for the 13th Amendment to a vote.<br> Do I hear a second?<br> I second the motion.<br> So moved, so ordered.<br> The Clerk will now...<br> Quiet, please!<br> The Clerk will now<br> call the roll for the voting.<br> We begin with Connecticut.<br> Mr. Augustus Benjamin,<br> on the matter of this amendment,<br> how say you?<br> Nay!<br> Mr. Arthur Bentleigh.<br> Nay!<br> Mr. John Ellis, how say you?<br> Aye!<br> - What!<br> Missouri next.

It's done.<br> If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,<br> even submit to losing freedoms,<br> the freedom to oppress, for instance<br> we may discover other freedoms<br> previously unknown to us.<br> Had you kept faith<br> with the democratic process,<br> as frustrating as that can be...<br> Come, sir.<br> Spare us, at least, these pieties.<br> Did you defeat us with ballots?<br> How have you held your Union together?<br> Through democracy?<br> How many hundreds<br> of thousands have died<br> during your administration?<br> Your Union, sir, is bonded<br> in cannon fire and death.<br> It may be you're right.<br> But say all we done is show the world<br> that democracy isn't chaos.<br> That there is a great, invisible strength<br> in a people's union.<br> Say we've shown that a people<br> can endure awful sacrifice<br> and yet cohere.<br> Mightn't that save at least<br> the idea of democracy to aspire to?<br> Eventually to become worthy of?<br> At all rates, whatever may be proven<br> by blood and sacrifice<br> must have been proved by now.<br> Shall we stop this bleeding?<br> Once he surrenders,<br> send his boys back to their homes<br> and their farms, their shops.<br> Yes, sir.<br> As we discussed.<br> Liberality all around, not punishment.<br> I don't want that.<br> And their leaders,<br> Jeff and the rest of them,<br> they escape, leave the country<br> while my back's turned,<br> that wouldn't upset me none.<br> When peace comes,<br> it mustn't just be hangings.<br> By outward appearance<br> you're 10 years older<br> than you were a year ago.<br> Hmm.<br> Some weariness has bit at my bones.<br> I never seen the like of it before,<br> what I seen today.<br> Never seen the like of it before.<br> You always knew that.<br> What this was going to be.<br> Intimate and ugly.<br> You must have needed to see it close<br> when you decided to come down here.<br> Hmm.<br> We've made it possible for<br> one another to do terrible things.<br> We've won the war.<br> Now you have to lead us out of it.<br> You have an itch to travel?<br> Mm-hmm. I'd like that.<br> To the West, by rail.<br> Overseas.<br> The Holy Land.<br> Awfully pious for a man<br> who takes his wife out<br> buggy-riding on Good Friday.<br> Jerusalem.<br> Where David and Solomon walked.<br> I dream of walking in that ancient city.<br> All anyone will remember of me<br> is I was crazy and<br> I ruined your happiness.<br> Anyone thinks that<br> doesn't understand, Molly.<br> When they look at you,<br> at what it cost to live at the heart of this,<br> they'll wonder at it.<br> They'll wonder at you.<br> They should.<br> But they should also look at<br> the wretched woman by your side<br> if they want to understand<br> what this was truly like.<br> For the ordinary person.<br> For anyone other than you.<br> You must try to be happier.<br> We must, both of us.<br> We've been so miserable for so long.<br> I did say some colored men...<br> The intelligent, the educated, and the<br> veterans. I qualified it.<br> Mr. Stevens is furious.<br> He wants to know why you qualified it.<br> No one heard<br> the intelligent or educated part.<br> All they heard was the first time<br> any president has ever made mention<br> of Negro voting.<br> Still, I wish I'd mentioned it<br> in a better speech.<br> Mr. Stevens also wants to know<br> why you didn't make a better speech.<br> Mrs. Lincoln is<br> waiting in the carriage.<br> She wants me to remind you<br> of the hour, and that<br> you'll have to pick up<br> Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.<br> - Am I in trouble?<br> - No, sir.<br> Thank you, Mr. Slade.<br> I suppose it's time to go.<br> Though I would rather stay.<br> The President has been shot!<br> The President<br> has been shot!
