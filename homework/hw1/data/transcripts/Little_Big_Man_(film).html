                        I am, beyond a doubt,<br> the last of the old-timers.<br> My name is Jack Crabb.<br> And I am the sole white survivor<br> of the Battle<br> of Little Big Horn...<br> uh... uh...<br> popularly known<br> as Custer's Last Stand.<br> Well...<br> Mr. Crabb, I'm more interested<br> in the primitive lifestyle<br> of the Plains Indian<br> than I am in the...<br> tall tales about Custer.<br> Tall tales?!<br> Are you calling me a liar?<br> - No, no...<br> - Huh?<br> No, it's just that...<br> I'm interested<br> in the way of life<br> of the Indian rather than,<br> shall we say, adventure.<br> You think the Battle of Little<br> Big Horn was... was a...<br> ...was an adventure?<br> Oh, shit.<br> Little Big Horn was not<br> representative of...<br> encounters between Whites<br> and Indians, Mr. Crabb.<br> You see the...<br> near genocide of the Indian...<br> The... the... the near what?!<br> Near genocide.<br> It means: "extermination;<br> the killing off<br> of an entire people. "<br> That's practically<br> what we did to the Indian.<br> But of course, I wouldn't expect<br> an old Indian fighter like you<br> to agree with me.<br> Turn that thing on.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I said, turn that thing on<br> and shut up.<br> Now you just set there,<br> and you'll learn something.<br> I knowed General<br> George Armstrong Custer<br> for what he was.<br> And I also knowed the Indians...<br> for what they was.<br> when I was ten years old,<br> my family...<br> in crossin' the Great Plains...<br> was wiped out<br> by a band of wild Indians.<br> Everybody was killed or drug off<br> by them murderin' varmints,<br> except me<br> and my sister Caroline.<br> Good-bye, Jack.<br> I'll see you in heaven.<br> Good-bye, Caroline.<br> We didn't know<br> the difference then,<br> but it was a band of Pawnee<br> what attacked us before.<br> I ain't had no use for Pawnee<br> ever since.<br> But this one wasn't a Pawnee.<br> He was a Cheyenne brave.<br> I later got to know him well.<br> His name was<br> Shadow That Comes In Sight.<br> At first sight<br> of an Indian camp,<br> what you think is, "I see<br> their dump, where's the camp?"<br> He brought us to their chief.<br> His name was Old Lodge Skins,<br> who later become my granddaddy.<br> What do they want, Caroline?<br> It's as plain as day<br> what they want, Jack.<br> What?<br> Me.<br> To show good manners,<br> Old Lodge Skins smoked<br> with our oldest male survivor.<br> They didn't know I was a woman.<br> That explains why<br> they didn't rape me right off.<br> I don't think they're gonna<br> bother you, Caroline.<br> No such luck, Jack.<br> They'll get me tonight,<br> for sure.<br> Poor Caroline never did<br> have no luck with men.<br> I reckoned she figured<br> we both couldn't get away,<br> and she'd send help back<br> to rescue me.<br> Next morning, I found myself<br> in that Indian camp all alone.<br> But the Cheyenne, who call<br> themselves the "Human Beings,"<br> had no idea to hurt me.<br> I was an honored guest,<br> and they gave me a real treat<br> for breakfast: Boiled dog.<br> Dog ain't bad, neither.<br> Now dog is greasy, I'll admit,<br> but you'd be surprised<br> how downright delicate<br> the flavor is,<br> especially when you're starving.<br> You see, the Human Beings<br> adopted me as one of their own.<br> Shadow That Comes In Sight<br> taught me the bow and arrow<br> and how to stalk game.<br> Burns Red In The Sun<br> showed me how to protect<br> my pale skin from sunburn.<br> It's a little known fact that<br> some Indians, like Burns Red,<br> will sunburn their own selves.<br> But my real teacher<br> was my adopted grandpa,<br> Old Lodge Skins.<br> He taught me to read a trail,<br> the Cheyenne language,<br> and lots of other things.<br> For a boy,<br> it was a kind of paradise.<br> I wasn't just playing Indian,<br> I was living Indian.<br> Only one thing bothered me.<br> I was small for my years.<br> In fact, a durn near runt.<br> The Pawnee stole<br> seven of our ponies.<br> There's gonna be a war party.<br> But you can't go.<br> You're too little<br> and weak like a girl.<br> Run away now or I'll kick you.<br> The Indians had never heard<br> of fistfightin',<br> and it plum amazed 'em.<br> How did you do that?<br> I'm sorry, Younger Bear.<br> I didn't mean to hurt you.<br> The Indian way...<br> you should never feel sorry<br> about beating an enemy unless<br> having conquered his body,<br> you want his spirit as well.<br> I had made the first<br> real enemy of my life.<br> There once was a Human Being,<br> and he was very small,<br> but he won a name:<br> Little Man.<br> You've heard of him.<br> No, Grandfather.<br> He went on a war party<br> against the Pawnees.<br> But the Pawnees were many.<br> One by one, the Human<br> Beings were rubbed out.<br> Little Man was very brave.<br> The Pawnees called out to him,<br> "If you will quit fighting,<br> we will let you go. "<br> But Little Man answered,<br> "It's a good day to die. "<br> Finally, they cut off his head.<br> But he kept fighting<br> without his head.<br> He rode among the Pawnees<br> like a whirlwind.<br> And his head...<br> it was stuck on a spear...<br> started to shout the war cry.<br> The Pawnees could take no more,<br> and they ran away.<br> When they looked back,<br> they saw the body of Little Man<br> lie down among his friends.<br> Little Man was small,<br> but his bravery was big.<br> The Human Beings don't require<br> a boy to be a warrior<br> if he ain't got<br> the temperament for it,<br> and Little Horse didn't.<br> If he wanted to stay behind<br> with the women<br> that was all right<br> with the Human Beings.<br> We will leave the ponies here.<br> You two will hold them.<br> No! I don't want to stay here.<br> I want to go to the Pawnee camp.<br> You!<br> You aren't even a Human Being!<br> You're white.<br> He didn't believe it himself.<br> Younger Bear was just trying<br> to hand me<br> the worst possible insult.<br> Little white man.<br> Fool poor Pawnee.<br> Big fooling.<br> You want to eat?<br> Shit, Pawnees was always<br> sucking up to whites.<br> Little white man not mad, huh?<br> See? Pawnee friend.<br> See?!<br> Fixes bad Injun<br> for little white man.<br> I always felt kind of bad<br> about that poor Pawnee.<br> I didn't mean to kill him.<br> I just meant to distract him.<br> I had made a real enemy<br> of Younger Bear.<br> I give you these ponies...<br> but... I owe you a life.<br> Saving his life<br> was the final insult.<br> This boy is no longer a boy.<br> He's a brave.<br> He is little in body,<br> but his heart is big.<br> His name shall be<br> "Little Big Man. "<br> I don't understand it,<br> Grandfather.<br> Why would they kill<br> women and children?<br> Because they are strange.<br> They do not seem to know<br> where the center<br> of the Earth is.<br> We must have<br> a war on these cowards<br> and teach them a lesson.<br> This will be the first time,<br> my son,<br> I face the whites as an enemy.<br> I don't know<br> whether you remember<br> before you became a Human Being,<br> and as dear a son to me as those<br> I made with Buffalo Wallow<br> Woman and the others...<br> But I won't speak of<br> that unfortunate time.<br> I just want to say,<br> if you believe<br> riding against these<br> white creatures is bad,<br> you can stay out of the fight.<br> No one will think the worse.<br> Grandfather,<br> I think it's a good day to die.<br> My heart soars like a hawk.<br> I'm sorry to say<br> that Old Lodge Skins' war<br> against the whites<br> was kind of pitiful.<br> Not that the Human Being<br> wasn't brave.<br> No warrior ever<br> walked the earth<br> more brave than a Human Being.<br> Old Lodge Skins' idea of war<br> and the whites' idea of war<br> were kind of different.<br> Half our party<br> didn't even use weapons.<br> What they done was "take coup,"<br> hit the enemy<br> with a little stick.<br> Humiliate them.<br> That was how the Human Beings<br> taught a coward a lesson<br> and won a war.<br> Shadow!<br> Look at 'em go!<br> We got 'em runnin', boys!<br> Go get that black bastard!<br> Shooting rifles<br> against bow and arrow.<br> I never could understand<br> how the white world<br> could be so proud of winning<br> with them kind of odds.<br> God bless George Washington!<br> Before I knowed it, them words<br> just popped out of my mouth.<br> God bless my mother!<br> You murdering fool!<br> Got to cut your throat to get it<br> through your head<br> I'm a white man.<br> White?<br> Sure I'm white.<br> Didn't you hear me say<br> "God bless George Washington"?<br> "God bless my mother"?<br> I mean, now, what kind<br> of Indian would say<br> a fool thing like that?<br> Lend me that<br> to get off this paint.<br> Yeah.<br> The troopers took me<br> under their wing<br> and turned me over<br> to the Reverend Silas Pendrake<br> for moral guidance<br> and a Christian upbringing.<br> Can you drive a buggy, boy?<br> Oh, yes, sir.<br> I can do it.<br> You're a liar, boy.<br> If you was reared by the Indians<br> how could you learn<br> to drive a buggy?<br> We shall have to beat<br> the lying out of you.<br> Oh, dear Jack.<br> Welcome to your new home.<br> Your travail is over,<br> enfolded now as you are<br> in Christian love.<br> Well, boy,<br> are you unable to converse?<br> Huh?<br> No, I'm glad to meet<br> your daughter, sir.<br> You are addressing my wife, boy.<br> Poor boy.<br> Poor darling.<br> Think of the years<br> of suffering,<br> deprivation and hardship<br> among those awful savages.<br> The boy's deprivation, my dear,<br> has been more spiritual<br> than physical.<br> The Indians know nothing of God<br> and moral right.<br> They eat human flesh,<br> fornicate,<br> adulterize,<br> misogynize and<br> commune constantly<br> with minions of the devil.<br> It must be our task,<br> nay, our Christian duty,<br> to beat the misery out...<br> Beat the poor boy?<br> Not while there's<br> a breath left in my body.<br> I could have kissed her.<br> Well, I didn't mean<br> beat him literally, my dear.<br> I meant to beat him<br> symbolically.<br> Poor boy.<br> He hasn't even had<br> a proper bath.<br> His darling neck is so...<br> I detect the odor of food.<br> I shall wash this poor,<br> dirty boy.<br> It's suppertime!<br> Silas,<br> it is my Christian duty<br> to give this boy an immediate<br> thorough bath.<br> Take off your clothes, dear.<br> Take my clothes off?<br> Yes.<br> All of them?<br> E- Every stitch.<br> But I shall avert my eyes<br> at the necessary moment.<br> Bringing in<br> The sheaves<br> Bringing in the sheaves<br> We shall come rejoicing<br> Bringing in the sheaves.<br> Greatest bath<br> I ever had in my life.<br> Shall we gather at the river,<br> The beautiful,<br> the beautiful river?<br> You do realize,<br> don't you, dear Jack,<br> that the Reverend Pendrake<br> is not altogether wrong.<br> What?<br> What, ma'am?<br> Well, Jesus is your savior.<br> You do realize that,<br> don't you dear Jack?<br> Oh, Lordy, yes, Mrs. Pendrake.<br> Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?<br> Yes'm. Yes, ma'am.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> But you musn't fib to me,<br> you know.<br> Oh, no, I love Jesus and Moses<br> and all of them...<br> There's quite a difference.<br> Moses was a Hebrew,<br> but Jesus was a gentile,<br> like you and me.<br> Aren't you done<br> washing that boy yet?<br> I'm giving the child important<br> religious instruction, Silas.<br> I want to eat!<br> Looks like a pretty well-growed<br> child, if you ask me.<br> All right now, dear,<br> please stand up<br> and let me dry you off.<br> I shall avert my eyes,<br> of course.<br> Fine... now step<br> out of the tub...<br> and...<br> Actually, you are<br> rather well grown, Jack.<br> You're small but...<br> nice-looking.<br> Did you know that?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Well, you are.<br> All the more reason<br> for you to receive<br> complete religious<br> instruction.<br> The girls, I'm sure,<br> will all be after you.<br> And Jack...<br> Ma'am?<br> That way lies madness.<br> What way, ma'am?<br> You, you'll understand these<br> things better when you're older.<br> The point is, my dear boy<br> that we all<br> must resist temptation.<br> Purity is its own reward.<br> Dear Jack.<br> Welcome to your new home.<br> Now dress...<br> and come in to supper.<br> I went to school<br> and learned all over<br> how to read and write<br> and cipher.<br> It was strange at first,<br> but Mrs. Pendrake tutored me,<br> and I learned fast.<br> But there was one thing I didn't<br> know nothing about,<br> and that was a thing called sin.<br> Aha! I caught you<br> at the gates of hell!<br> Boy!<br> The hand of God<br> must smite the carcass of man!<br> It's worth it, dear, Jack.<br> It's worth it a million times<br> over to be pure and good.<br> To walk in the paths<br> of righteousness.<br> There's no happiness like it.<br> Do you believe me, Jack?<br> Do you believe me?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I sure do.<br> Amazing grace, how sweet...<br> So it was I entered<br> my religion period.<br> I was a great<br> little hymn singer.<br> And I wasn't fooling, neither.<br> I'd been saved!<br> I baptize you in the name<br> of the Father and the Son<br> and the Holy Spirit!<br> Oh, Lord, look down upon<br> this poor boy who lived<br> among the heathen,<br> and cleanse him<br> of the corruption<br> of their foul and pagan ways.<br> And make him white<br> again as the snow.<br> Let him be reborn<br> and repurified<br> in Thy name.<br> I baptize you<br> in the name of the Father<br> and the Son<br> and the Holy Spirit!<br> Amen.<br> Mrs. Pendrake was right<br> about temptation.<br> Jack...<br> I wasn't having nothing<br> to do with them Jezebels.<br> I told her all about my triumph<br> over temptation,<br> and we read the Bible<br> for about an hour, to celebrate.<br> As the weeks went by,<br> I fell more and more<br> in love with Mrs. Pendrake.<br> Spiritually, of course.<br> Well...<br> I shall be off on<br> my Wednesday shopping.<br> The boy's doing so poor<br> these days,<br> why don't you<br> take him along and air him?<br> He'd be bored with shopping.<br> No, I wouldn't, ma'am.<br> All right, then,<br> you come with me, Jack.<br> Good morning, Mr. Kane.<br> Ma'am.<br> This is Jack,<br> my adopted son.<br> What's your pleasure, ma'am?<br> Well, let's see...<br> I think I shall have<br> a sassafras flip.<br> How about you, buster?<br> Huh?<br> Oh, yeah, I'll have the same.<br> Never mind for me, Mr. Kane.<br> I must be off<br> with my shopping.<br> It would bore you terribly,<br> Jack, dear.<br> You stay here<br> and have some cake.<br> I'll take care of him,<br> Mrs. Pendrake.<br> Thank you very much,<br> I'm sure, Mr. Kane.<br> That soda shop was something.<br> Especially that<br> elephant-head spigot.<br> I was playing with it,<br> and enjoying myself,<br> then, all of a sudden,<br> an awful feeling<br> run through me.<br> Where had that fellow gone to?<br> Don't...<br> No, don't...<br> Oh, yeah...<br> No, don't!<br> You beast...<br> Do-Don't...<br> Pagan beast!

That's impossible.<br> I've never set eyes<br> on you before.<br> Oh, I wouldn't figure<br> you'd remember me, sir.<br> Furthermore, you don't<br> look like a scout to me.<br> Not a bit.<br> A scout has<br> a certain appearance.<br> Kit Carson, for example.<br> But you don't have it.<br> You look like...<br> a mule skinner.<br> Well, I don't know<br> anything about<br> mules, sir.<br> It's a remarkable thing,<br> but I can tell<br> the occupation of a man<br> merely by looking at him.<br> Notice the bandy legs.<br> Hmm?<br> Strong arms.<br> This man has spent years<br> with mules.<br> Isn't that correct?<br> Well, I...<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hire the mule skinner!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Over here.<br> Come on.<br> Did you just hear what he said?<br> Supposed to hire you.<br> I wouldn't want<br> no wife of mine back<br> after she'd been<br> with the Injuns.<br> Kindest thing,<br> a bullet in the brain.<br> Well, I don't agree.<br> And I want my wife back.<br> Well...<br> one of the Pawnee located<br> a band of the vermin<br> camped down the river.<br> We ride in the morning!<br> Is-Is there, is there<br> any white women with them?<br> Now my advice to you<br> is to get yourself<br> a little revenge<br> on them bucks.<br> All right.<br> Spare the females and children,<br> if possible.<br> Let's go.<br> No!<br> Hey!<br> No!<br> Hey!<br> He said spare the women<br> and children!<br> Give me that!<br> Let go of my rifle!<br> The hell I will.<br> You've killed<br> the women and babies!<br> You bastard!<br> You son of a bitch!<br> Let go of my horse!<br> Call 'em back, sir!<br> You'll hang for this!<br> It was downright discouraging.<br> If it wasn't the Indians<br> trying to kill me for a white,<br> it was the whites trying<br> to kill me for an Indian.<br> It made me sick.<br> The Pawnee scouts<br> and soldiers both<br> was killing<br> everything in sight.<br> Shadow!<br> Brother, let's talk.<br> You'll be took care of later.<br> I'm saving you for the hanging.<br> There's no describing<br> how I felt.<br> An enemy had saved my life<br> by the violent murder<br> of one of my best friends.<br> The world was too ridiculous<br> even to bother to live in.<br> That was why Shadow was there,<br> and that was why<br> he'd fought so hard.<br> I sat there<br> and watched that baby<br> come into this world.<br> Except for her breathing,<br> that woman never made a sound.<br> If woman she was.<br> She didn't look<br> more than a girl.<br> I couldn't take my eyes<br> off of that girl and her baby.<br> All right,<br> let's get the hell out.<br> Let the Pawnee clean up.<br> Bugler, assemble our troop!<br> Listen to me.<br> If you are kin to Shadow...<br> then you know of Little Big Man.<br> I was a friend<br> of the Human Beings<br> until they stole my wife.<br> Are you Shadow's wife?<br> His daughter?<br> Where is your husband?<br> Killed.<br> What's your name?<br> Sunshine.<br> I'm going to<br> take you with me...<br> and trade you<br> for my wife.<br> Clear them bushes, Younger.<br> Move on. Nobody here.<br> Let's get the hell out.<br> Wait here, woman.<br> Hello, Grandfather.<br> Greetings, my son.<br> Do you want to eat?<br> Grandfather?<br> What happened to your neck,<br> Grandfather?<br> It's a wound.<br> It cut the tunnel<br> through which light travels<br> to the heart.<br> You... you mean you're blind?<br> Oh, no.<br> My eyes still see.<br> But my heart no longer<br> receives it.<br> How did it happen?<br> White man.<br> Where's Buffalo Wallow Woman?<br> Rubbed out.<br> And White Elk Woman, too.<br> And Dirt on the Nose.<br> And High Wolf.<br> And many others.<br> And Burns Red?<br> Yes.<br> Burns Red in the Sun?<br> Rubbed out.<br> His wife... his children...<br> and many more.<br> Do you hate them?<br> Do you hate<br> the white man now?<br> Do you see this fine thing?<br> Do you admire<br> the humanity of it?<br> Because the Human Beings,<br> my son,<br> they believe<br> everything is alive.<br> Not only man and animals,<br> but also water, earth, stone,<br> and also the things from them,<br> like that hair.<br> The man<br> from whom this hair came,<br> he's bald on the other side<br> because I now own his scalp.<br> That is the way things are.<br> But the white men,<br> they believe<br> everything is dead:<br> Stone, earth, animals,<br> and people.<br> Even their own people.<br> If things keep trying to live,<br> white man will rub them out.<br> That is the difference.<br> You will stay with us...<br> my son.<br> A year later,<br> I was still with 'em.<br> After wandering all over,<br> in constant danger<br> of being killed by white<br> settlers or white soldiers,<br> we come to a place<br> knowed as the Indian Nations.<br> It was a tract of land<br> by the Washita River<br> that had been gived forever<br> to the Indians by the Congress<br> and the President<br> of the United States.<br> We was safe there.<br> This was Indian land.<br> As long as grass growed<br> and wind blow<br> and the sky is blue.<br> Your new son's<br> kicking a lot today.<br> I think he wants to come out<br> and see his father.<br> Tell him to wait<br> until I finish my dinner.<br> I'll tell him, but I don't think<br> he's going to wait much longer.<br> It's a good thing<br> I have a strong, brave husband<br> who brings in so much<br> game and food.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> My strong husband<br> brings in much more<br> than we need.<br> There are many<br> Human Beings here.<br> Many bands<br> from many places.<br> But it's sad.<br> Many husbands<br> have been rubbed out<br> by the white man.<br> It is sad because women<br> sleep alone and cry.<br> Be quiet now.<br> I'm digesting.<br> Yes, but I think<br> my sisters are here.<br> Your what?!<br> My sisters.<br> Digging Bear, Little Elk<br> and Corn Woman.<br> I think they're here.<br> What do you mean,<br> you think they're here?<br> I believe they are.<br> You bring in<br> much more food than we need.<br> It is very sad.<br> They have no husbands<br> and they cry.<br> Well, that's too bad;<br> I'm sorry.<br> Digging Bear had a baby<br> and lost it.<br> And so did Corn Woman.<br> But Little Elk<br> had no baby at all.<br> All right, what do you want me<br> to do about it?<br> I knew you'd understand.<br> It was Old Lodge Skins' dream<br> trying to come true.<br> I was determined to stay out<br> of them buffalo robes.<br> Three young and healthy women<br> with no man<br> for who knows how long. Mmm.<br> The very idea kind of shrunk me<br> like a spider on a hot stove.<br> Why, it's Little Big Man!<br> Oh, Little Big Man!<br> Younger Bear,<br> it's Little Big Man!<br> He's not a Contrary anymore.<br> He has a wife.<br> She's plump, she works hard,<br> but she henpecks him.<br> Just when I think you are dead,<br> and the buzzards have eaten you,<br> you always come back.<br> Yes, and I always will<br> till you pay me<br> the life you owe me.<br> I've heard you.<br> Now, come to my tepee<br> and eat.<br> We was caught<br> in Cheyenne hospitality.<br> I'm a very important man.<br> More important than you.<br> I have a wife<br> and four horses.<br> I have a horse<br> and... four wives.<br> Well, that may be.<br> But... my wife,<br> she's a very good one.<br> See?<br> Oh, so<br> there you are,<br> you crawling coyote.<br> What are we going to eat, huh?<br> This starved duck?<br> Oh...<br> Oh, who's the foolish beggar<br> you brought to steal<br> what little food we have?<br> Clean it, clean it!<br> Ooh!<br> It was Olga.<br> I had found her at last.<br> One duck.<br> Olga never did learn<br> much English<br> but she sure in hell<br> had learned Cheyenne.<br> I, I, I just<br> don't understand it.<br> Usually, this woman is...<br> gentle as a dove.<br> My words were not the words<br> to speak to a stranger.<br> You stay and eat.<br> You see what a good wife she is?<br> It's because<br> I'm a wonderful lover.<br> Go in my tepee.<br> She will cook this duck for you.<br> That's all right;<br> I'm not hungry.<br> You've humiliated him again.<br> Good-bye, Younger Bear.<br> You look tired, Little Big Man.<br> Do you want<br> to come into my tepee<br> and rest on soft furs?<br> Why don't you live with me,<br> and I'll be your wife?<br> Thank you for inviting me.<br> Well, I've got to fix my hair<br> to sing tonight.<br> Good-bye, Little Big Man.<br> Good-bye, Little Horse.<br> And so I finally found Olga.<br> I'd lost her long ago<br> to the Human Beings,<br> and I saw no good reason<br> to reveal myself to her now.<br> Grandfather!<br> Why have you moved your tepee<br> so far from our band?<br> The ponies are trying<br> to tell me something.<br> Last night I had a dream.<br> The ponies were dying.<br> I heard them scream.<br> I'd learned to respect<br> Old Lodge Skins' dreams,<br> but for once,<br> we were in a safe place,<br> give to us by a treaty.<br> Why do you hate my sisters?<br> I don't hate your sisters, I...<br> It... it's just that...<br> the Great Spirit...<br> tells me...<br> Where are you going?<br> Your son won't wait any longer.<br> He wants to come out<br> and see his father.<br> Sunshine, Indian style,<br> was going off to have her baby.<br> As I watched her walk away,<br> it come over me<br> that the Great Spirit wanted me<br> to go in that tepee.<br> Who wants to be first?<br> Who's this here?<br> It's me.<br> Well, I...<br> guess you'll do as well as any.<br> I figured<br> she was the littlest one,<br> and it would be easy.<br> But Lord help us,<br> them young girls is deadly.<br> However, the Great Spirit<br> was with me...<br> and I survived.<br> Only thing was,<br> just as I was about<br> to drift off real peaceful...<br> No, you stay.<br> Not yet.<br> Maybe I can get back later.<br> Idle boasting, I assure you.<br> Who's this here?<br> It's me, Digging Bear.<br> Well, she wasn't called<br> Digging Bear for nothing,<br> I can tell you that.<br> Stay here.<br> Corn Woman's too tired.<br> Oh.<br> She don't sound tired to me.<br> That's not her.<br> That's Little Elk.<br> That's both of them.<br> Little Elk, you go on to sleep.<br> You, too.<br> Digging Bear!<br> Corn Woman, where are you?<br> I was lucky<br> I come across her last.<br> The others, too?<br> Yes.<br> I knew you were a good man.<br> Here's your new son.<br> I reckon right then<br> I come pretty close<br> to turning pure Indian,<br> and I probably would have spent<br> the rest of my days<br> with Sunshine and her sisters.<br> But sometimes grass don't grow,<br> wind don't blow...<br> ...and the sky ain't blue.<br> Something's wrong<br> with the ponies.<br> Wolves.<br> Grandfather's d... Here!<br> Go inside.<br> Don't leave the tepee.<br> Grandfather,<br> what's wrong with the ponies?<br> Don't you hear that, my son?<br> I wonder why I didn't see them<br> in my dream.<br> Sunshine!<br> Grandfather,<br> you've got to get inside.<br> Why bother, son?<br> It's a good day to die.<br> We've got to get<br> to the riverbank!<br> I am blind.<br> I cannot fight.<br> But I won't run.<br> If it's<br> my day to die,<br> I want to do it here<br> within a circle.<br> Grandfather...<br> the river is part<br> of the great circle<br> of the waters of the Earth.<br> That's true,<br> but the soldiers would kill us<br> before we could get<br> to the river.<br> The sol...? Grandfather,<br> you didn't see any soldiers<br> in your dream,<br> and-and that means that...<br> that they can't see you now.<br> You think so?<br> Yes, yes.<br> What else did your dream mean?<br> I think you're right.<br> Then let's go to the great<br> circle of the river!<br> Invisible.<br> I never been invisible before.<br> It's too late.<br> We're cut off.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> We're invisible.<br> Grandfather, wait!<br> Grandfather!<br> I know it sounds ridiculous<br> but them soldiers never<br> lifted a hand to stop us.<br> I reckon it was so crazy,<br> they couldn't figure it out.<br> Or maybe they thought<br> we was prisoners<br> or even friendlies<br> since Old Lodge Skins<br> was grinning at them<br> like a raccoon.<br> Or maybe<br> we really was invisible.<br> All I knowed is we walked<br> right through 'em to the river.<br> Circle the camp!<br> Circle the camp, boys!<br> That was extremely enjoyable.<br> Glad you liked it<br> Grandfather.<br> Captain!<br> Captain...<br> ...shoot the Indian ponies.<br> I beg your pardon, sir?<br> That is my decision.<br> - I shall shoot the ponies.<br> - But, sir!<br> - Sunshine...<br> - Go and do it!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Young man,<br> your self-righteous piety<br> is commencing to annoy me.<br> But I-I didn't<br> say anything, sir.<br> You think it's shocking<br> to shoot a few ponies?<br> Well, let me tell you,<br> the women are far more important<br> than the ponies.<br> The point is,<br> they breed like rats,<br> however, Lieutenant,<br> this is a legal action.<br> And the men are under strict<br> orders not to shoot the women.<br> Unless, of course,<br> they refuse to surrender.<br> Isn't that correct?!<br> Yes, sir, yes, sir.<br> Sunshine!<br> Run! Run!<br> Run!<br> No!<br> Where you going, soldier?<br> Message for the General.<br> Wait a minute.<br> What's that on your face?<br> Oh, mud, sir.<br> That's not mud,<br> that's Indian paint.<br> And that's an Indian knife.<br> What's your company?<br> My company, sir?<br> Yes, and the name of<br> your commanding officer.<br> What's the trouble, Captain?<br> I think we've got<br> a renegade, General.<br> He's wearing Indian paint<br> and he doesn't know<br> his commanding officer<br> or his company.<br> Take him away and hang him.<br> General!<br> General, don't you remember me?<br> I'm Jack Crabb,<br> the mule skinner!<br> Mule skinner?<br> Yes, sir!<br> I applied for a job as scout,<br> but you could tell<br> my true occupation<br> just by looking at me.<br> Yes, yes, I believe<br> I do remember that.<br> How did you become a renegade?<br> General...<br> I ain't no renegade!<br> I was captured by the Cheyenne<br> and held prisoner!<br> Why, they...<br> they took cactus thorns<br> and stuck them in me!<br> But I just laughed<br> and begged them<br> to keep on doing it!<br> You... laughed?<br> I laughed my head off!<br> Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.<br> Gentlemen, it is difficult<br> to admit to an error.<br> Captain?<br> Captain, your summary judgment<br> was wholly mistaken!<br> Now aren't you glad I saw fit<br> to question this<br> man more closely?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Please be more careful<br> in the future, Captain.<br> I'll drink the tea now,<br> Corporal.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What are you doing<br> up here, mule skinner?<br> Nothing, I...<br> just brought you tea, General.<br> And I wanted to...<br> thank you again<br> for sparing my life.<br> Why are you standing<br> to the side?<br> Turn this way.<br> You came up here<br> to kill me, didn't you?<br> And you lost your nerve.<br> Well, I was correct, in a sense.<br> You are a renegade,<br> but you are no Cheyenne brave.<br> Custer was right.<br> I was a total failure<br> as an Indian.<br> Do I hang you?<br> I think not.<br> Get out of here.<br> You're not going to hang me?<br> Your miserable life<br> is not worth<br> the reversal<br> of a Custer decision.<br> That was the worst thing<br> he could have done to me.<br> There was nothing left<br> of my self-respect at all.<br> I couldn't go back<br> to the Indians<br> so I went back among<br> the whites and become a drunk.<br> Boy, you're a sad sight, Hoss.<br> You should have stuck<br> to sody-pop.<br> How are things with you, Bill?<br> Fine.<br> I've changed my ways, Hoss.<br> That's good.<br> Say, Bill,<br> I need a drink worse than<br> a breath of life itself.<br> - Here's $20.<br> - Oh!<br> Get gloriously drunk.<br> But first, go across<br> the street to the barber,<br> and have yourself a bath,<br> and buy some clothes.<br> Then come see me in the saloon.<br> One thing I do know, Hoss,<br> any damn fool<br> can drink himself to death.<br> Come on. Come on!<br> Bill, I want to...<br> Hoss, I'd like to ask you<br> a confidential favor.<br> It's a delicate matter<br> involving a-a widow.<br> She needs a train ticket<br> out of town.<br> You give her this.<br> Sure, Bill.<br> See, my new, beautiful wife<br> is violently jealous,<br> and... and this widow,<br> oh, she's quite a widow.<br> I think I know<br> what you mean, Bill.<br> Her name was Lulu Kane.<br> Right now, Bill.<br> Good.<br> Get out of the way!<br> Get out of the way!<br> Get out of the way!<br> Bill!

"<br> Well, Jack.<br> Now you know.<br> This is a house of ill fame,<br> and I'm a fallen flower.<br> That widow hadn't lost<br> her style one bit.<br> "A fallen flower. "<br> Chokes me up to think about it.<br> This life is not only wicked<br> and sinful,<br> it isn't even any fun.<br> No, I reckon, I reckon not,<br> Miss Pendrake.<br> If I was married<br> and could come here<br> once or twice a week,<br> well, it might be fun.<br> But every night?<br> It's just boring.<br> Oh, I can understand that.<br> I can't seem to save any money.<br> Well, if I could just<br> save a few dollars<br> I could go to visit<br> my-my maiden aunt in Washington.<br> New clothes, a carriage.<br> And who knows,<br> I might even marry a senator.<br> Oh! You'd make a good wife<br> for a senator<br> Miss Pendrake.<br> You always were a sweet boy.<br> Do you know,<br> I often had wicked thoughts<br> about you?<br> Huh?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Several times.<br> I almost gave in to temptation.<br> And now... here we are.<br> Miss Pendrake,<br> what are you doing?<br> Do you know that once<br> I tiptoed into your room,<br> and stood over you<br> for the longest time?<br> It was the most awful<br> temptation to wake you up.<br> I wish that I had.<br> It would have been<br> deliciously wicked.<br> Is anything<br> the matter, Jack?<br> No.<br> Then I'll wait for you in the...<br> place of retirement.<br> You should have<br> woke me up that night<br> years ago, Miss Pendrake.<br> This is from Wild Bill.<br> It was his last wish<br> that you go to Washington<br> and live with your maiden aunt.<br> His last wish<br> was to save me?<br> Oh, Jack.<br> I must honor that wish.<br> You can do it, Miss Pendrake.<br> Yes, I can...<br> and I will.<br> I got to go now.<br> Good-bye, Miss Pendrake.<br> Oh, good-bye, Jack.<br> And thank you ever so much.<br> Oh, and Jack...<br> ...if you're ever<br> in Washington, do look me up.<br> How are things with you,<br> Mr. Meriweather?<br> Splendid.<br> Well, now, look at that.<br> Buffalo hides.<br> There's a world of money<br> chewing grass<br> on those plains, Jack.<br> There goes<br> Buffalo Bill himself.<br> Oh...<br> Yes, sir.<br> Multiply that by thousands.<br> Little Jack, the buffalo<br> is getting scarce.<br> You were raised by Indians.<br> You should<br> know how to track them.<br> Yeah, but...<br> We could make a killing, Jack.<br> Haven't changed a bit, Jack.<br> Neither have you.<br> You'd better watch out,<br> Mr. Meriweather.<br> They're whittlin' you down<br> pretty serious.<br> You can't afford to lose<br> any more of your parts.<br> Every business<br> has a particle of risk.<br> Bye, dear boy.<br> That was my low.<br> I had reached the bottom.<br> I'd become a hermit.<br> I went deep in the wilderness,<br> as far away as I could get.<br> Then one day,<br> I found something<br> trappers see fairly regular.<br> An animal had gnawed off<br> its own foot<br> to escape from the trap.<br> Something snapped in my head.<br> I decided<br> life wasn't fit to live<br> and the only thing to do<br> was to mingle<br> with the twinkling stars.<br> Good-bye, Jack.<br> Good-bye, Little Big Man.<br> At that moment,<br> I really was crazy<br> and I was darn near<br> off that cliff when...<br> The time had come<br> to look the devil in the eye<br> and send him to hell<br> where he belonged.<br> The only question was,<br> how to get him there?<br> Sergeant, take this man...<br> ...and give him some clothes.<br> This man will be invaluable<br> to me, Major.<br> Invaluable, sir?<br> I almost hanged that man<br> as a renegade.<br> Now, he asks me for a job<br> as a scout.<br> Oh, his game<br> is very obvious... to lead me<br> away from his Indian friends.<br> I still don't quite<br> follow you, General.<br> Anything that man tells me<br> will be a lie.<br> Therefore, he will be<br> a perfect reverse barometer.<br> Isn't that correct?<br> Of course, General.<br> Move them out, men. Ho!<br> In my belief,<br> Custer's hate for the Indians<br> and his ambition<br> had combined on him.<br> He figured he needed one more<br> dramatic victory<br> over the Indians<br> to be nominated for<br> President of the United States.<br> That is a true historical fact.<br> Men, hold!<br> We will take brief refreshment.<br> Water only!<br> Dismount!<br> Water break!<br> Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.<br> It's the celibacy of the saddle.<br> I had muscle spasms all night.<br> The poison from the goo-nads.<br> Poison from the what, sir?<br> Goo-nads.<br> That's medical terminology.<br> General, it's my duty as your...<br> The poison rises<br> from the goo-nads<br> to the throat and then seeps<br> down to various muscles.<br> General...<br> the Crows want to know<br> if you're going down<br> in the Medicine Tail Coulee.<br> Oh, they do, do they?<br> Yes, sir, they do.<br> They claim they want time<br> to sing their death song.<br> Tell the Crows they're women!<br> But, sir...<br> if the hostiles<br> come in behind us,<br> and if they're<br> waiting for us down below,<br> we'll never get out of there.<br> Hostiles behind us?<br> I see no hostiles behind us.<br> Do you see any hostiles<br> behind us, Major?<br> No, sir, not at the moment...<br> Then, then, then...<br> ...stop trying to cause<br> a reversal<br> of a Custer decision.<br> But, sir, wouldn't it...<br> wouldn't it be best<br> to send a squad down<br> Medicine Tail Coulee?<br> No, it wouldn't.<br> But, sir...<br> may I ask, sir, why it wouldn't?<br> Because Major, it would cost us<br> the vital element of surprise.<br> Surprise? General,<br> they know we're here.<br> Yes, but they don't know<br> that I intend to attack them<br> without mercy.<br> But, General,<br> that's no surprise.<br> Of course it is.<br> Nothing is this world<br> is more surprising<br> than the attack without mercy.<br> General...<br> General, I must protest<br> this impetuous decision.<br> A Custer decision, impetuous?<br> Grant called me impetuous, too!<br> The drunkard.<br> Sitting there<br> in the White House,<br> calling me impetuous!<br> General, General,<br> I implore you to reconsider.<br> Think of the men<br> whose lives depend upon you.<br> What do you think<br> I should do, mule skinner?<br> Sir, that man<br> doesn't know anything.<br> What do you say, mule skinner?<br> Should I go down there<br> or withdraw?<br> I had him.<br> But this time<br> what I held in my hand<br> wasn't a knife<br> but the truth.<br> Well?<br> What's your answer,<br> mule skinner?<br> General...<br> you go down there.<br> You're advising me<br> to go into the Coulee?<br> Yes, sir.<br> There are no Indians there,<br> I suppose?<br> I didn't say that.<br> There are thousands<br> of Indians down there.<br> And when they get done with you,<br> there won't be nothing left<br> but a greasy spot.<br> This ain't the Washita<br> River, General.<br> And them ain't helpless women<br> and children waiting for you.<br> They're Cheyenne brave<br> and Sioux.<br> You go down there<br> if you got the nerve.<br> Still trying to outsmart me,<br> aren't you, mule skinner?<br> You want me to think that you<br> don't want me to go down there,<br> but the subtle truth is,<br> you really don't want me<br> to go down there.<br> Well, are you<br> reassured now, Major?<br> Men of the seventh!<br> The hour of victory<br> is at hand!<br> Onward to Little Big Horn<br> and glory!<br> We've caught them napping!<br> Sound the charge!<br> We have them on the run, men!<br> Take no prisoners!<br> Now we've got them, men!<br> Men, Custer's with you!<br> Custer's honor!<br> Stay with me!<br> What are they doing?<br> Why aren't they charging?<br> There's nowhere to charge to!<br> Fight!
