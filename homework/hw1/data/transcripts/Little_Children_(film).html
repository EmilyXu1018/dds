                        Want to take a walk with me?<br> ...continue to protest the presence<br> of a convicted sex offender<br> in their neighborhood.<br> Michelle Betler reports.<br> Thanks, Rick. I'm standing here<br> on Woodward Court,<br> the quiet residential<br> street<br> that has become<br> the focus of controversy<br> ever since 48-year-old<br> Ronald James McGorvey returned here<br> after serving a two-year<br> prison sentence<br> for indecent exposure<br> to a minor.<br> In the past few days<br> an organization<br> known as the Committee<br> of Concerned Parents<br> began distributing these notices<br> throughout the community<br> warning neighbors<br> of what they call a quote,<br> "Dangerous predator<br> in our midst."<br> I don't really like having<br> him that close to my family.<br> I think it's outrageous.<br> This block has too many children<br> for a sex offender to, uh, be<br> moving in the neighborhood.<br> I-- I don't think<br> it's a good idea.<br> Makes me very nervous.<br> Makes me a little enraged.<br> Um, I'd have a problem<br> if I see him on the street.<br> It's like having an<br> alcoholic work in a bar.<br> They don't mix.<br> They shouldn't be together.<br> The conditions of his parole<br> expressly forbid McGorvey<br> to be within 100 yards<br> of any playground,<br> school or recreation area<br> where children normally gather.<br> These conditions seem<br> to be of little comfort<br> to the many parents whose<br> children play and go to school<br> in this formerly<br> tranquil community,<br> and who in the coming days and weeks<br> will be hoping for the best<br> but preparing for the worst.<br> Rick, back to you.<br> My husband and I had an<br> actual spiritual experience.<br> We did this intense<br> spa treatment--<br> - Oh, come on.<br> - No, listen to me.<br> It was on our vacation in Cabo<br> and there were eight other couples<br> and this Mayan woman.<br> A goddess,<br> just a goddess.<br> - She had--<br> - She's due in September.<br> She thinks she's gonna<br> take three months off,<br> then it's Christmas, then she'll be back<br> to work the first of the year.<br> Please.<br> Six months from now she'll be right here<br> on this bench with us.<br> My friend Beth said<br> that the way she did it<br> was to just take him with her every time<br> she went to the bathroom.<br> - I find that strange.<br> - Yeah, that's what I said to Beth.<br> It's Oedipal.<br> What's the rush?<br> Although I will say, when I was trying<br> to potty-train Christian,<br> I opened the diaper<br> and it was huge!<br> Like a grown man.<br> Smiling politely to mask a<br> familiar feeling of desperation<br> Sarah reminded herself to think<br> like an anthropologist.<br> She was a researcher studying the<br> behavior of typical suburban women.<br> They weren't organic?<br> She was not a typical<br> suburban woman herself.<br> Troy, stop that!<br> Paul and I were having<br> sex the other night<br> and I drifted off<br> right in the middle of it.<br> It happens.<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> But when I woke up and apologized<br> he said he hadn't<br> even noticed.<br> You know what<br> you should do?<br> Set aside a specific<br> block of time for it.<br> That's what Louis and I do--<br> every Tuesday night at 9:00.<br> "Whether you want to or not"<br> Sarah thought,<br> her eyes straying over<br> to the play area.<br> Even at such a tiny<br> playground as this<br> Lucy didn't interact much<br> with the other children.<br> Sarah didn't really know why<br> they even bothered coming here,<br> except that she'd<br> probably go crazy<br> trapped in the house<br> all day<br> with this unknowable<br> little person.<br> Morning snack time<br> was 10:30 on the dot...<br> Snack time!<br> ...a regimen established<br> and maintained by Mary Ann,<br> who believed that rigid<br> adherence to a timetable<br> was not only the key<br> to a healthy marriage,<br> but to effective<br> parenting as well.<br> - I'll take this one!<br> - I want that one!<br> - Can I do it?<br> - Yeah. Ready?<br> Mommy...<br> where's my snack?<br> I'm sorry, honey,<br> Mommy can't find it.<br> - I forgot the rice cakes.<br> - Poor thing.<br> - I'm sure it's in here somewhere.<br> - Second time this week.<br> Well, who's going to keep<br> track of everything?<br> - Bad mommy. Bad mommy.<br> - Just calm down, please.<br> No calm down!<br> I want my snack!<br> All right, you know what?<br> It's--<br> it's just not here, okay?<br> See for yourself.<br> Wait!<br> Troy, honey,<br> give Lucy your goldfish.<br> No!<br> Troy Jonathan,<br> give me those goldfish!<br> But, Mama, they're mine.<br> No back talk.<br> You can share with your sister.<br> Troy has goldfish for you.<br> Go sit down.<br> That's much more than 10.<br> - That's great.<br> - Look how big I made my lawn.<br> Thank you, Mary Ann,<br> you're a life saver.<br> It's nothing.<br> I just hate to see her suffer like that.<br> Maybe you should make<br> a checklist and tape it to the door<br> so it's the last thing you<br> see before leaving the house.<br> That's what I do.<br> Yeah, thank you. That's-- that's<br> a really helpful suggestion.<br> You're welcome.<br> Drink your juice.<br> Are you the plane again?<br> Look.<br> Now you have to act like me.<br> The prom king.<br> Oh my God,<br> he's back.<br> Sarah followed<br> the other women's gazes<br> over to the entrance<br> of the playground,<br> eager to finally get a glimpse<br> of the prom king,<br> the handsome and mysterious<br> young father<br> who had been a regular<br> at the Walker Street playground<br> for several weeks<br> this past spring<br> before abruptly<br> dropping out of sight.<br> I don't need a rest.<br> I need an airplane ride.<br> His departure had left a gaping<br> hole in the emotional lives<br> of Cheryl, Theresa<br> and Mary Ann.<br> Barely a day went by without one<br> of them speculating wistfully<br> about the reason for his absence<br> and the likelihood of his return.<br> Here I come.<br> There's no room for two of us, diesel.<br> You've done it again.<br> I hate steam engines.<br> When I come back I will<br> pinch you with my pinchers.<br> Yeah?<br> Well, when I come back<br> I'm gonna ram you<br> with my rammer.<br> - Ready?<br> - No, you won't.<br> Every time you win,<br> diesel!<br> I know.<br> - Hello!<br> - Mommy's home.<br> The jester's cap was something<br> that truly disturbed Brad.<br> All day long the boy ate,<br> played and napped in it.<br> But the moment his mother stepped in<br> the house he had no more use for it.<br> As if the entire day<br> up to that point<br> had been a pointless<br> and somewhat useless charade.<br> You got some sun<br> today, didn't you?<br> Did Daddy forget<br> the sunscreen again?<br> What are you doing?<br> That's his full name.<br> What's your favorite thing about him?<br> Um...<br> I like to come over<br> to his house.<br> Hmm.<br> I think I'm gonna finally break down<br> and get a cellphone.<br> - Really?<br> - Mmm.<br> Why?<br> I have no way of reaching you<br> when I'm out with Aaron.<br> You're done,<br> right?<br> You've got one.<br> Don't you think it's<br> strange that I don't?<br> Yeah, I do.<br> You just never wanted one before.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> There's a family plan.<br> We can talk for free.<br> Okay.<br> Let's just see where we are<br> at the end of the month.<br> Yeah?<br> Are your hands okay?<br> As was her custom each week<br> night after dinner,<br> the boy's mother sent Brad<br> down to the municipal library<br> to study for the bar exam.<br> But he never quite made it through<br> the door of the building.<br> Brad had been watching<br> the skateboarders for weeks now,<br> sometimes for as long<br> as an hour at a stretch.<br> But he never received the slightest<br> acknowledgement from any of them.<br> He'd been the same age as these<br> boys when his mother died.<br> - You do that!<br> - No way!<br> - Nice.<br> - Hey, that was nice, dude!<br> "I must have been like this,"<br> Brad sometimes thought.<br> "I must have been<br> one of them."<br> Awful.<br> He should be castrated.<br> Quick and clean,<br> just chop it off.<br> Then you wouldn't have to worry<br> about notifying the neighbors.<br> You know what else<br> you should do?<br> Nail his penis above the entrance<br> to the elementary school.<br> You know, as a warning<br> to other perverts.<br> You think<br> this is funny?<br> I just can't believe you want to<br> castrate a man for indecent exposure.<br> My brother used<br> to expose himself when--<br> when we were teenagers.<br> He'd do it in my bedroom,<br> he'd do it in the dining room,<br> he'd do it in the back seat of a car.<br> He'd always figure out a way to do it so<br> that nobody could see him except me.<br> Didn't you<br> tell anyone?<br> No, I didn't want<br> to get him in trouble.<br> Maybe he should<br> be castrated.<br> It's not the same thing.<br> He wasn't doing it to strangers.<br> Oh my God, there he is.<br> After all this time,<br> two days in a row.<br> Where's the fire?<br> Maybe he needed a vacation.<br> From what?<br> From being<br> the prom king.<br> It's a dirty job,<br> but someone's gotta do it.<br> - Close it?<br> - Close it.<br> Close the gate.<br> There you go.<br> - It's open.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Somebody else will close it.<br> - Are we practicing?<br> Are we playing<br> up on the swings?<br> Swing time!<br> What's he do for a living?<br> We've never actually<br> spoken to him.<br> Really?<br> We don't even<br> know his name.<br> I thought you guys said<br> he was a regular here.<br> - It was awkward.<br> - He made us nervous.<br> You had to think about what you<br> were gonna wear in the morning.<br> You know, put on makeup.<br> It was exhausting.<br> Mommy, push me!<br> Okay.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Wait!<br> Five bucks if you get<br> his phone number.<br> How old is she?<br> Lucy,<br> tell the nice boy<br> how old you are.<br> I'm three.<br> My grandma<br> lives in New Jersey.<br> She doesn't have<br> a swim pool.<br> Do you like to swim?<br> I don't like sharks.<br> They eat you up.<br> Don't listen to him.<br> We go to the town pool<br> almost every day.<br> - I'm Brad, by the way.<br> - Sarah.<br> You guys come<br> here a lot?<br> No, just the last<br> few weeks.<br> I usually go to the one<br> over on Harris,<br> with the big wood things,<br> you know, and the slide across.<br> Yeah, we actually rent a house<br> right around the corner<br> from there on Ashforth.<br> That ice cream truck never leaves.<br> Such a nightmare.<br> Yeah, tell me about it.<br> You know, you're the first person<br> here who's ever talked to me.<br> You make 'em nervous.<br> Oh, right.<br> I guess they don't see too many fathers<br> here during the weekdays.<br> You don't have to be polite.<br> Go ahead and ask.<br> What?<br> You know, what the person who wears the<br> pants in the family does for a living.<br> Oh. All right,<br> what does your wife do?<br> - She makes documentaries.<br> - Oh, wow.<br> - Like Michael Moore?<br> - Uh, like PBS.<br> Oh.<br> Well, I think it's<br> admirable you're here.<br> There's no reason fathers<br> can't be primary caregivers.<br> I finished law school<br> two years ago,<br> but I can't seem to pass the bar exam.<br> Failed it twice now.<br> Maybe you just don't<br> want to be a lawyer.<br> I'll take the test<br> one more time.<br> If I mess up now<br> I'll just have to find something else<br> to do with my life.<br> - Right, buddy?<br> - Right.<br> Sarah was shocked by how Brad<br> delivered this confession,<br> with no apparent sense of being in the<br> least bit embarrassed by his failure.<br> Most men weren't like this.<br> Her husband Richard<br> certainly wasn't.<br> She wondered if Brad was<br> always this forthcoming.<br> If anything,<br> he seemed a little lonely,<br> all too ready to open his heart at<br> the slightest sign of interest,<br> like a lot of young<br> mothers she knew.<br> I couldn't help noticing<br> your stroller.<br> Do you have<br> another child?<br> No, just Aaron.<br> Got that at a yard sale.<br> Extra seat comes in handy<br> for the bear, though.<br> Lucy refuses to go<br> in a stroller or a car seat.<br> We have to walk everywhere. It takes us<br> half an hour to go three blocks,<br> unless I carry her.<br> - Daddy, I'm finished.<br> - Are you sure? We just got here.<br> I'm finished right now.<br> Okay. All right,<br> here we go.<br> Ready?<br> One, two, three.<br> - Oops.<br> - Oh, hold on for a second.<br> - There, thank you.<br> - Are you okay?<br> No problem.<br> It was then while watching Brad<br> kneel down at his son's feet<br> that Sarah found herself gripped by<br> an unexpected pang of sadness.<br> "Don't go," she thought.<br> "Don't leave me here<br> with the others."<br> - It was nice talking to you.<br> - Same here.<br> Wait! Um...<br> Come here. Just...<br> come here.<br> You see those women<br> over there?<br> Just, yeah, don't--<br> don't look.<br> You know what<br> they call you?<br> What?<br> The prom king.<br> Oh God, really?<br> Yeah, they mean it<br> as a compliment.<br> You're a big character<br> in their fantasy lives.<br> Wow.<br> Um, so one of them bet me $5<br> I couldn't get your phone number.<br> Five bucks, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Could we split<br> it 50-50?<br> It could be<br> arranged.<br> It doesn't have to be<br> your real number.<br> Oh, well, you know, in that case, sure.<br> You got a pen?<br> Great. Oh shit, no I--<br> um, no I don't.<br> - Uh...<br> - Well...<br> No wait, just--<br> wait.<br> You know what'd<br> really be funny?<br> If you gave me a hug.<br> - You think?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right, come here.<br> Oh my God.<br> Do you want to really<br> freak them out?<br> Yeah.<br> Who's gonna talk in there?<br> - Oh my God!<br> - Troy!<br> - Lucy!<br> - Isabelle!<br> Isabelle! Come here, Isabelle.<br> Okay, we have to go.<br> - Isabelle!<br> - Troy!<br> - I think that worked.<br> - Yeah, I think so.<br> - Um, well, it was nice meeting you.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's okay, yeah.<br> We're gonna go.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Lucy?<br> We're gonna go home.<br> Okay, here we go,<br> good girl.<br> Good girl.<br> I'm sure your daughter<br> found that very educational.<br> His name is Brad.<br> He's a lawyer<br> and he's really very nice.<br> For the past few days<br> Sarah hadn't been able<br> to concentrate on anything<br> but the prom king<br> and the curious thing<br> that had happened<br> between them<br> on the playground.<br> She didn't feel<br> shame or guilt,<br> only a sense of profound<br> disorientation,<br> as if she had been<br> kidnapped by aliens<br> then released unharmed<br> a few hours later.<br> As he had so often<br> in recent days,<br> Brad mentally reenacted<br> the kiss by the swing set.<br> He still couldn't believe<br> it had really happened.<br> And with all those women<br> and children watching.<br> Troy! Troy!<br> Aaron had been particularly<br> curious about what he'd seen.<br> Why you hugging<br> that lady?<br> Well, that's what<br> I'm trying to show you with Bozo.<br> Sometimes it's a game that adults play<br> to show that they're friends.<br> You say, "Hi,<br> I'm your friend."<br> Aaron was skeptical.<br> They returned to the playground<br> the following morning,<br> but no one was there.<br> Sarah hadn't shown up<br> at the town pool either,<br> though Brad remembered telling<br> her that he and Aaron<br> could be found there<br> most afternoons.<br> It didn't seem to matter<br> that Sarah wasn't his type,<br> wasn't even that pretty--<br> at least not compared to Kathy,<br> who had long legs<br> and lustrous hair<br> and perfect breasts.<br> Sarah was short, boyish,<br> and had eyebrows that were thicker<br> than Brad thought necessary.<br> But even so, she'd walked<br> into his arms that day<br> as if she were fulfilling<br> a secret wish<br> he hadn't remembered<br> making.<br> Hey, pervert!<br> Yeah, you,<br> you pervert!<br> You like little<br> boys, do you?<br> - Larry?<br> - Yes, it's fucking Larry!<br> Jesus, man, don't<br> even joke about that.<br> What are you doing?<br> Are you busy?<br> Uh, actually I'm<br> supposed to be studying.<br> Taking the bar exam<br> next month.<br> I thought you<br> did that last year.<br> Yeah.<br> See how well I did?<br> I got a better idea.<br> Get in.<br> Come on. Come on,<br> come on, come on, come on, come on.<br> Do you mind holding these?<br> Try to keep them nice.<br> Oh, uh...<br> are you, uh, part<br> of the committee?<br> I am the committee.<br> Wow.<br> That's-- that's<br> quite a commitment.<br> Yeah.<br> Aren't you full time<br> on the force already?<br> Yeah, I'm-- I'm taking<br> a little time off.<br> You know what<br> they should do to this bastard?<br> Just castrate him.<br> You know, pfft!<br> Get it over with,<br> right?<br> Yeah.<br> You look good.<br> You've been, uh,<br> working out?<br> Uh, just push-ups,<br> crunches...<br> a little light running.<br> The guys are<br> gonna love this.<br> What guys?<br> Wow, this is something.<br> Yeah, it's pretty,<br> but doesn't have a lot of give.<br> It's like<br> playing on cement.<br> Hey, hold on<br> a second.<br> Duane, I've really gotta talk<br> to you about the committee.<br> I mean, it would mean a lot to have<br> your support on this thing.<br> I told you already, Larry, none of us<br> are gonna get involved in that shit.<br> We're here to play ball. If that's your<br> thing, fine, but leave us out of it.<br> Okay okay, fine.<br> I get it, I get it, I get it. Guys!<br> Bring it in!<br> Come on, come on,<br> hustle up!<br> I want you all to meet<br> our new quarterback.<br> - Quarterback?<br> - Guy better not be a pussy.<br> He played in college.<br> Uh, I'm a little<br> behind the curve.<br> Who are you guys?<br> - We're the Guardians!<br> - We're cops.<br> Welcome to the Tri-County<br> touch football night league.<br> Let's just work on some<br> simple pass patterns.<br> Brad waited for his<br> good sense to kick in.<br> There were lots of excuses<br> available to him.<br> But it felt so good to be standing here<br> beneath the bright lights.<br> And he was filled<br> with a feeling similar to the one<br> he'd had right<br> before kissing Sarah,<br> like his world had<br> cracked open<br> to reveal a thrilling<br> new possibility.<br> Okay, just let me<br> warm up a little.<br> All right! Let's go!<br> Set, hut!<br> What the fuck?<br> That's a late hit!<br> This ain't<br> Pop Warner, ace.<br> You fucking faggot.<br> You call yourself a quarterback?<br> Oh, this isn't me.<br> What are you doing?<br> What is that?<br> What's that for?<br> I want the scumbag<br> to know I'm keeping an eye on him.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Oh, uh...<br> I don't think we want<br> to be here, Larry.<br> It's not a question<br> of want.<br> Joanie thinks I'm<br> obsessed with this creep.<br> She thinks if I had a job, I wouldn't<br> be driving past his house<br> five, six times a day.<br> But you know what?<br> I kinda think<br> this is my job.<br> There's a roll of duct tape<br> in the glove compartment.<br> Would you grab it for me?<br> Honey?<br> Hi!<br> Where were you?<br> Oh my God.<br> What happened?<br> I-- I-- I joined<br> this group.<br> The Committee<br> for Concerned Parents.<br> We're distributing flyers about<br> that creep on Woodward Court.<br> These guys play a little<br> touch football after.<br> This late?<br> Uh, it's a night league.<br> So it's gonna be<br> a regular thing?<br> No no no no,<br> just once a week,<br> after I'm done<br> studying at the library.<br> Is that okay?<br> Uh, who are the guys?<br> You remember<br> Larry Hedges?<br> The guy from the Sprinkler<br> Park with the twins?<br> It's his organization.<br> I thought you<br> didn't like him.<br> He's okay.<br> This committee makes a<br> lot of sense. I mean it's--<br> it's pretty scary having<br> a weirdo like that<br> living right<br> by the playground.<br> Mmm.<br> I know.<br> I hate to even<br> think about it.<br> Guess you'd better<br> take a shower.<br> Brad showered quickly,<br> sensing a rare opportunity<br> to have sex with his wife.<br> "This is just what I need,"<br> he thought.<br> "Something to take<br> my mind off that kiss."<br> Please don't.<br> Come on, Kathy, we've<br> been through this before.<br> He needs to start<br> sleeping by himself.<br> I know.<br> He looks so comfy.<br> Well, he'll be just<br> as comfy in his own bed.<br> I just miss<br> him so much.<br> I'm getting a little tired waking up<br> with his foot in my face.<br> It's a perfect foot.<br> Look at him.<br> Just look at him.<br> He's a handsome devil.<br> Mmm, he's perfect.<br> Good night.<br> Number 2 Hillcrest<br> was an impressive<br> piece of real estate.<br> Even so,<br> Sarah was ambivalent<br> about the house<br> she occupied.<br> She wasn't involved<br> with its purchase or design.<br> The place was a hand-me-down of sorts<br> from Richard's mother.<br> And the furnishings<br> were leftovers from his first marriage.<br> By the time<br> Sarah arrived here<br> Richard wasn't all that<br> interested in redecorating.<br> And so she decided<br> to leave it as it was,<br> with the exception of a single room<br> that she staked out for her own<br> and gradually began<br> to populate it<br> with the remnants<br> of her former self.<br> From the moment<br> Lucy was born<br> Sarah had refused to hire<br> someone for child care.<br> Read me a story?<br> In a minute,<br> okay?<br> - Can I sit on your lap?<br> - I said in a minute!<br> Go finish your<br> program, go.<br> She wasn't exactly sure<br> why she had taken this stance.<br> The truth was she spent<br> most afternoons marking time,<br> waiting desperately for the moment<br> when her husband returned from work<br> and she could finally<br> have a moment to herself.<br> But even this was not<br> something she could rely on.<br> You're ready to roll?<br> Could you wait<br> a few minutes?<br> I'm sorry, Richard's barricaded<br> in the upstairs office<br> - finishing some stuff for work.<br> - No problem.<br> I've got a little surprise<br> for someone anyway.<br> She's a terror at night.<br> I couldn't get her to nap again.<br> - Oh, the poor thing.<br> - Poor mom is more like it.<br> Hello.<br> Is there a cute little<br> girl in the house?<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> What--<br> what have I found?<br> - A beanie.<br> - Oh, a beanie.<br> Jean, you didn't<br> need to to that.<br> Oh, this little dog needed<br> a girl to take care of him.<br> And I know a little girl<br> who needed a dog.<br> Let me see.<br> Sarah was beginning<br> to get angry.<br> Her evening fitness walk<br> was the one thing<br> she looked forward to all day,<br> and Richard knew this.<br> But if there was one thing<br> life had taught Richard,<br> it was that it was<br> ridiculous<br> to be at war<br> with your own desires.<br> He could easily imagine what people<br> would say if they could see him now--<br> Exactly the same thing they'd<br> say if someone had told them<br> that Ray from next door<br> was a transvestite,<br> or that Ted from work<br> had anonymous gay sex<br> at highway rest stops.<br> "But we want what we want,"<br> Richard thought,<br> "and there's not much<br> we can do about it."<br> He had stumbled<br> on the site 11 months ago<br> while doing research<br> for a consulting firm.<br> His office door<br> was wide open.<br> But he clicked<br> on the link anyway.<br> He was deeply engrossed<br> in his discovery<br> when Ted knocked<br> on his door.<br> I'm taking lunch orders.<br> You want something?<br> Casually, but with great haste<br> Richard banished Slutty Kay<br> from his screen...<br> Uh, yeah, I'll have<br> a chicken Caesar.<br> ...and reentered the flow<br> of an ordinary day.<br> It wasn't until<br> several months later<br> that Richard gave the slightest thought<br> to the site he had stumbled upon.<br> Do you need me<br> for anything else?<br> Uh, no no, you<br> can head home.<br> I'm just gonna catch up<br> on some e-mail.<br> Well, don't stay too late.<br> Your dinner will get cold.<br> Lately Slutty Kay<br> had become a problem.<br> He thought about her<br> far too often,<br> and spent hours studying<br> the thousands of photographs<br> available to him.<br> Some of Kay's practices<br> struck him as bizarre,<br> even off-putting.<br> She had a thing<br> about kitchen utensils,<br> spatulas, and dressing up<br> like a little girl<br> and playing with balloons.<br> But who was<br> Richard to judge?<br> Oh, that's it.<br> Though as close as Richard<br> sometimes felt to Slutty Kay,<br> as much as he believed<br> that he knew her,<br> he could never get past<br> the uncomfortable fact<br> that she existed for him<br> solely as a digital image.<br> The panties were an attempt<br> to solve this problem.<br> Maybe a sniff or two<br> would hurry things along,<br> so he could get back<br> downstairs to his real life,<br> where his wife<br> was waiting for him<br> her impatience increasing<br> by the minute.<br> What are you doing?<br> Are you almost finished there? 'Cause<br> I'd really like to go for my walk?<br> - You could have knocked.<br> - I did!<br> We need to talk.<br> You're awfully quiet<br> this evening.<br> - Everything okay?<br> - What?<br> Yeah.<br> You'll have to walk<br> without me tomorrow night.<br> I've got a book<br> group meeting.<br> Okay.<br> You're sure everything's<br> all right?<br> Yeah, sorry.<br> I guess I'm just<br> a little tired.<br> So what are<br> you reading?<br> "Crime and<br> Punishment."<br> Wow. That's pretty<br> highbrow for a book group.<br> Well, we have some<br> very stimulating discussions.<br> You should come next month.<br> We're doing "Madame Bovary."<br> You could be<br> my little sister.<br> Little sister?<br> We're trying to get younger<br> women involved.<br> We call them<br> our little sisters.<br> I don't know, Jean.<br> I read "Madame Bovary"<br> in grad school.<br> It's a pretty<br> misogynist text.<br> Well, that's an<br> interesting perspective.<br> - You should come.<br> - Let me think about it.<br> Oh, would you<br> excuse me, Jean?<br> Someone's at my door.<br> I'll call you, okay?<br> Hi!<br> Hi!<br> Wow, God,<br> this is a surprise.<br> I haven't seen<br> you since--<br> I-- I hope you don't mind. Your husband<br> said you'd be back any minute.<br> Oh, no,<br> not at all.<br> It's good<br> to see you.<br> God, um, can I get you<br> some tea or something?<br> I can only stay a minute.<br> I just came to warn you.<br> - You know that guy, the pervert?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> He's been riding his<br> bike near the playground<br> - checking out the kids.<br> - Oh, God.<br> Oh, God,<br> do the police know?<br> Nothing they can do.<br> He's not breaking any laws.<br> I guess they're just waiting<br> for him to kill someone.<br> I just thought<br> you should know.<br> Thanks, that's<br> nice of you.<br> Let me get<br> you some tea.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I-- I don't think it's a good idea.<br> I didn't mean<br> to kiss him.<br> I don't even know<br> how it happened.<br> I'd better go.<br> Mike's gonna worry.<br> You wanna talk?<br> I'm tired.<br> Hello.<br> Hey.<br> No, he's still<br> sleeping.<br> Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm going<br> through it right now.<br> No, I guess I<br> don't need them.<br> Okay.<br> All right, bye.<br> H-hi.<br> H-hello?<br> Yes, I'd like<br> to place an order.<br> Pierce, Sarah,<br> Mrs.<br> Um...<br> it's the red bathing suit<br> on page 29.<br> The hide-your-tummy<br> halter neck.<br> Uh, I'm size...<br> I mean, I think.<br> E-eight.<br> You want to go<br> in the pool?<br> You do?<br> One, two.<br> Daddy, can I go<br> in the pool now?<br> In a minute, okay?<br> Okay.<br> There you go.<br> Mommy, I have<br> to go pee-pee.<br> Just go in the pool.<br> Huh-uh, I want<br> to go to the bathroom.<br> Really?<br> Okay, come on.<br> Okay, ready?<br> There.<br> Swing down.<br> Hey, I'm drumming it.<br> Oh.<br> Wow.<br> - It's you.<br> - Yeah, hey.<br> - Hi!<br> - Okay.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> Lucy has sensitive skin.<br> She's better off<br> in the shade.<br> Oh no,<br> not at all.<br> It's nice<br> to see you again.<br> Yeah, you too.<br> I'm sorry,<br> would you get my back?<br> Um...<br> okay, sure.<br> Thanks.<br> Right.<br> # Who is knocking<br> on the door? #<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - # Knocking on the door #<br> # Knocking on the door #<br> - # Who is knocking on the door? #<br> - It's okay, just...<br> # A way, hey hey. #<br> Lucy, say hi to the little boy<br> from the playground.<br> Hi.<br> You remember him?<br> The pool became a ritual.<br> I was trying to think.<br> I just didn't know the way.<br> - Oh oh, okay.<br> - I'm here, I'm here.<br> We have the creature<br> and we have flower.<br> Right.<br> Day after day they sat<br> together in the shade<br> getting to know<br> each other.<br> This needs mustard.<br> - Mustard?<br> - Yeah.<br> Having little choice<br> in the matter,<br> Aaron and Lucy formed<br> a fragile friendship.<br> Aw, that's perfect.<br> Sometimes Brad and Sarah<br> traded offspring.<br> Mama said, "What Papa<br> told you was right.<br> It's not a good idea<br> to talk to strangers."<br> It was the most fun<br> Sarah had had in years.<br> But there was always<br> that longing to touch,<br> to be touched by Brad.<br> And, as badly as<br> she wanted this,<br> she wanted just as badly<br> to hold on to the innocent public life<br> they'd made for themselves<br> out in the open.<br> So she accepted<br> the trade--<br> the melancholy<br> handshake at 4:00<br> in exchange for this<br> little patch of grass,<br> some sunscreen<br> and companionship.<br> One more happy day<br> at the pool.<br> Okay, no pasta<br> for dinner, okay?<br> We eat way too much<br> pasta around here.<br> I thought you<br> liked my pasta.<br> No, I do.<br> That's the problem.<br> Pretty soon I can sell advertising<br> space on my ass.<br> No, that's okay.<br> I've got to go.<br> I've got<br> a 9:00 at Taps.<br> I thought you were<br> already editing.<br> Yeah, so did I.<br> It was just--<br> there's something in this<br> family's story that really got to me.<br> The father was...<br> K-I-L-L-E-D<br> in a, um,<br> mortar attack,<br> and, um, left behind<br> a little boy.<br> I was talking to the mother the other<br> day on the phone,<br> and she was saying she didn't know what<br> she was going to do next Christmas.<br> Jeez, I bet.<br> No, it wasn't like that.<br> It was more...<br> she was wondering, should she keep<br> this tradition with her son<br> that began with<br> the boy's father.<br> And she was saying<br> he had this knack<br> for requesting<br> odd Christmas gifts--<br> scuba gear one year<br> and rappelling gear<br> the next.<br> She said he wasn't<br> afraid to try anything.<br> Trying new things<br> made him feel...<br> more alive.<br> I've got to go.<br> See you later.<br> Patch one of your best<br> and then we'll patch both of them.<br> Okay?<br> Hey, I got something.<br> Hot enough for you?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, it's so humid.<br> I've got football<br> practice tonight.<br> Be like playing<br> in a sauna.<br> Watch out for<br> that Italian guy.<br> What's his name?<br> Corrente?<br> Yeah.<br> Remember what<br> happened to your knee last week?<br> You should be<br> careful, Brad.<br> I'll be careful.<br> Promise?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I promise.<br> Weatherman said<br> scattered showers.<br> I don't see<br> scattered showers.<br> Mom, could I please<br> have some money for a snack?<br> No, sweetheart.<br> You guys just had a snack. No.<br> Oh, okay.<br> All they want is sugar.<br> Constantly.<br> Oh, no.<br> It's him.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> Oh my God,<br> it's him.<br> He's in the pool.<br> Oh my God!<br> Jacob, get out<br> of the pool now!<br> Oh my God.<br> That's him.<br> - Get away from that man.<br> - Why is everybody running to the pool?<br> Brooke?<br> Jake?<br> Dale, you'd better<br> get over here.<br> Get out of the pool!<br> Where's your sister?<br> Why'd we have to get out, Mom?<br> I'm scared.<br> - What did he do?<br> - What's going on?<br> I'm scared.<br> Um, why the<br> police is here?<br> Um, there's a man over there who<br> doesn't have a ticket to get in,<br> so they're asking<br> him to go home.<br> Mr. McGorvey.<br> Mr. McGorvey.<br> It'd be wise for you to get<br> out of the pool at this time.<br> Did that man<br> go near you?<br> You're sure he<br> didn't touch you?<br> Step out of<br> the pool, sir.<br> I was only trying<br> to cool off.<br> All right,<br> let's go.<br> You can go back in the pool.<br> Bear with us, please. You<br> know what that sounds means.<br> Let's go. Out of the pool.<br> We're closing her up. Let's go.<br> Exit the pool and vacate<br> the grounds immediately.<br> Okay, I'll see<br> you tomorrow.<br> You're going to carry her?<br> Come on, put her in the stroller.<br> No, she won't do the stroller.<br> - Really?<br> - No, she will not do this.<br> Lucy, would you like to go<br> in the stroller?<br> Can I interest you in a stroller?<br> It appears she'd like a stroller.<br> It's out of<br> your way.<br> No, it's fine.<br> You don't mind, do you, Aaron?<br> Run!<br> You'd better come inside.<br> You can't walk home in this.<br> Oh!<br> - You can put him down in Lucy's room.<br> - Okay.<br> This is amazing.<br> She never naps.<br> Well, he'll be<br> out for the next two hours.<br> We'll have to get him out<br> of that nightgown, though,<br> before he wakes up<br> or he'll never forgive me.<br> Nice place.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, Richard does<br> all right for himself.<br> What's he do, again?<br> Lies. Um, please have a seat.<br> Make yourself comfortable.<br> Better not,<br> I might ruin your furniture.<br> I'll put these things in the dryer<br> and get us some towels.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, God!<br> Oh, God!<br> Do you feel bad<br> about this?<br> No, I don't.<br> I do.<br> I feel really bad.<br> Okay.<br> Son?<br> Son?<br> Be well.<br> May knew it wasn't natural<br> for a grown man<br> to be living with his mother.<br> No hobbies,<br> no diversions.<br> It was like he was<br> still in prison.<br> What he needed<br> was a girlfriend,<br> and May intended to<br> help him find one.<br> There are four whole columns<br> of lonely women here,<br> and only a handful of men.<br> The odds are on our side.<br> Why wouldn't one of<br> these women want<br> to meet a nice<br> person like you?<br> I'm not<br> a nice person.<br> You did a bad thing.<br> But that doesn't mean<br> you're a bad person.<br> I have a psychosexual<br> disorder.<br> You're better now.<br> They wouldn't have let<br> you out if you weren't.<br> They let me out<br> because they had to.<br> Well, maybe<br> if you found<br> a girlfriend closer<br> to your own age<br> you wouldn't have<br> the bad urges so often.<br> I don't want a girlfriend<br> my own age, Mommy.<br> I wish I did.<br> What are you going<br> to do when I'm gone?<br> Who's going to<br> take care of you?<br> What's the matter,<br> Mommy?<br> Are you sick<br> or something?<br> I'm an old woman.<br> I'm not going to live forever,<br> Who's going to cook<br> for you?<br> Who's going<br> to wash the dishes?<br> I can wash<br> the dishes,<br> You've never washed<br> a dish in your life.<br> I could do it if I had to.<br> I'm not a retard.<br> No, you're not.<br> You're a miracle,<br> Ronnie.<br> We're all miracles.<br> You know why?<br> Because as humans,<br> everyday we go<br> about our business,<br> and all that time<br> we know, we all know<br> that the things<br> we love,<br> the people we love...<br> at any time, it can<br> all be taken away.<br> We live knowing that<br> and we keep<br> going anyway.<br> Animals don't do that.<br> Now I'm not asking you<br> to get married, Ronnie.<br> I'm just saying put an ad in the paper,<br> see what happens.<br> Fine.

Mom, please.<br> - I'm happy to help.<br> Aw, shit.<br> Although the Guardians<br> lost by 26 points,<br> Brad felt oddly exhilarated in the bar<br> after the game.<br> He could feel a new respect<br> in the way the cops looked at him.<br> - What you drinking, buddy?<br> - He wasn't on probation anymore.<br> He was a member<br> of the team.<br> Ice and Advil.<br> If all else fails, you can always see<br> the team physician,<br> Dr. Daniels.<br> All his friends call him Jack.<br> - To the good doctor.<br> - Hear, hear.<br> - Larry? Here, you go Larry.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> Let me just<br> grab a chair.<br> Oh, we just gave you a shot.<br> We just gave you a shot.<br> I had no business being<br> on that field tonight.<br> I let you down.<br> I let the whole<br> team down.<br> I'm slow and<br> I'm fat.<br> I let that guy<br> piss all over me.<br> Come on. That guy was offsides<br> the whole night.<br> Joanie left me.<br> Took the kids and went<br> to her mother's.<br> Jesus, Larry,<br> that's a tough break.<br> Oh, I deserved it.<br> Me and my big mouth.<br> I called her<br> a fucking whore,<br> right in front<br> of the kids.<br> Why did you do that?<br> Huh,<br> I don't know.<br> I was in a bad mood<br> or something.<br> Now I'm fucked.<br> Hey, did you hear<br> about the pervert?<br> He went swimming<br> at the town pool.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who told you that?<br> - Nobody. I saw it myself.<br> - The town pool?<br> - Yeah, during the heatwave.<br> - The town pool?<br> - Yep.<br> Th-that place is<br> crawling with kids.<br> I mean, my boys<br> go there.<br> Yeah, well, you know what,<br> it was just that one time.<br> Um, he-- he won't be back.<br> The cops came.<br> Cops?

Just a little chat.<br> This is my house.<br> I pay the mortgage,<br> and I say who is<br> and isn't--<br> Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!<br> - Get your perverted ass down here now.<br> - I'm calling the police.<br> I hear they're well-disposed<br> to child molesters.<br> It's okay, Mommy.<br> Can I help you, gentlemen?<br> Ronnie, you go<br> on upstairs.<br> Larry, let him go. I think he gets<br> the point. We can go home now.<br> You listen to me, you<br> little piece of shit.<br> You stay the fuck away<br> from the town pool.<br> - You hear me?<br> - You're a bully!<br> My Ronnie would<br> never do what he did.<br> That poor child<br> at the mall--<br> what you did to him.<br> Larry?<br> Larry?<br> Why did she<br> say that?<br> Oh, don't pretend you<br> don't know about me.<br> Everybody knows.<br> Everybody!<br> Look, h-honestly,<br> I-- I don't know anything.<br> I remember hearing<br> something...<br> a few years ago<br> when we first moved here, but--<br> something about<br> a-- a shooting<br> at the mall.<br> That's-- that's it.<br> That's all.<br> I didn't even<br> know you then.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> Dispatch said there<br> was a shooter loose at the mall.<br> It was 10 minutes<br> from the end of my shift.<br> been someone else.<br> I can still see that<br> boy's face staring up at me.<br> Yeah, but--<br> but it was an accident.<br> You were trying<br> to stop a guy,<br> and the-- the boy<br> g-got caught<br> in the crossfire,<br> right?<br> No, I panicked.<br> There was no shooter.<br> Just the boy.<br> Antoine Harris<br> was his name.<br> He was big for his age,<br> only 13 years old.<br> He was a good kid.<br> Thought it was a joke,<br> waving around an air gun<br> at his friend<br> in the Big 5.<br> They were acting out some scene<br> from some movie they liked.<br> Shop girl saw it<br> from across the way,<br> called 911.<br> Jesus, that's terrible.<br> That...<br> well, you didn't know.<br> It could have<br> been real.<br> But it wasn't.<br> His parents...<br> uh, his parents--<br> I had to...<br> I was diagnosed with post-traumatic<br> stress syndrome<br> by three different<br> psychiatrists.<br> That's why I retired.<br> I couldn't do<br> the job anymore.<br> - So why don't you do something else?<br> - Like what?<br> Drive a forklift<br> at Costco?<br> Maybe you could<br> go back to school.<br> I loved my job.<br> I don't wanna do<br> anything else.<br> You ever think about the term<br> "homeland security"?<br> I mean,<br> really think about it?<br> The day that<br> you found out<br> that your father had<br> been killed in Iraq,<br> do you remember<br> that day?<br> Can you talk<br> about that?<br> You feel comfortable<br> talking about that?<br> After the men came<br> to tell my mom,<br> I cried,<br> but she didn't.<br> She just went up<br> to her room<br> and grabbed the pillows<br> off the bed,<br> cut the tops off of them<br> with a pair scissors.<br> There were feathers<br> all over the place.<br> That must have really<br> frightened you.<br> No, she was trying<br> to find the crown.<br> The crown?<br> The crown you leave<br> in your pillow<br> when you've slept on it<br> for a long time.<br> My--<br> my father had<br> two crowns.<br> Stop there.<br> - You hungry?<br> - No.<br> Mind if I get<br> some lunch?<br> No, go ahead.<br> Brad?<br> Honey, you there?<br> Pick up.<br> I know you're there.<br> It's Aaron's nap time.<br> Okay, I guess you guys<br> are out somewhere.<br> Um...<br> I love you both.<br> Bye.<br> I certainly did.<br> Here we go.<br> I don't know, Jean.<br> I don't think I'm up for this.<br> Well, now don't<br> be silly.<br> - It'll be fun.<br> - Really?<br> You're not the only<br> little sister here tonight.<br> - Oh, that's good.<br> - Oh!<br> Hi, would you<br> like a glass?<br> Did anybody like this book?<br> Because I really just hated it.<br> It's so depressing.<br> She cheats on her husband<br> with two different guys,<br> wastes all his money,<br> then kills herself with rat poison?<br> Do I really need<br> to read this?<br> Well, there is a lot<br> of good descriptive writing.<br> It's supposed<br> to be depressing.<br> It's a tragedy.<br> Madame Bovary was undone<br> by a tragic flaw.<br> What's her flaw?<br> Blindness.<br> She didn't see<br> that the men were<br> just using her.<br> She just wants<br> a little romance in her life.<br> - You can't blame her for that.<br> - It's about women's choices.<br> Back then, a woman<br> didn't have a lot of choices.<br> You could be a nun<br> or a wife.<br> - That's all there was.<br> - Or a prostitute.<br> She had a choice.<br> She had a choice not<br> to cheat on her husband.<br> I found it refreshing<br> to read about a woman<br> reclaiming her sexuality.<br> Is that a nice way<br> of saying she's a slut?<br> Madame Bovary's<br> not a slut.<br> She's one of the great<br> characters in Western literature.<br> I was a little puzzled<br> by some of the sexual references.<br> Look,<br> like this one.<br> Um...<br> "He abandoned<br> every last shred<br> of restraint<br> and consideration.<br> He turned her<br> into something compliant,<br> something corrupt."<br> Does anyone know<br> what that means?<br> It means<br> she's a slut.<br> Is he tying her up<br> or something?<br> Anal sex.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Did everyone get that<br> but me?<br> Let's set that aside<br> for now.<br> I'm really eager<br> to hear what<br> our other little sister<br> has to say.<br> I'm not sure if you know this,<br> but Sarah has a Ph.D<br> in English lit.<br> Just a masters.<br> I never wrote<br> my dissertation.<br> Well, you still have<br> a lot more expertise<br> than the rest of us.<br> I think I understand<br> your feelings about this book.<br> I used to have some<br> problems with it myself.<br> When I read it<br> in grad school,<br> Madame Bovary just<br> seemed like a fool.<br> She marries<br> the wrong man,<br> makes one foolish mistake<br> after another.<br> But when I read it this time,<br> I just fell in love with her.<br> She's trapped.<br> She has a choice. She can either<br> accept a life of misery<br> or she can struggle<br> against it.<br> And she chooses<br> to struggle.<br> Some struggle--<br> hop into bed<br> with every guy<br> who says hello.<br> Well, she fails in the end, but there's<br> something beautiful<br> and even heroic<br> in her rebellion.<br> My professors would<br> kill me for even thinking this,<br> but...<br> in her own<br> strange way,<br> Emma Bovary<br> is a feminist.<br> Oh, that's nice.<br> So now cheating on your husband<br> makes you a feminist?<br> No no no.<br> It's not the cheating.<br> It's the hunger.<br> The hunger<br> for an alternative,<br> and the refusal to accept<br> a life of unhappiness.<br> Maybe I didn't<br> understand the book.<br> She just looks<br> so pathetic.<br> Is she pretty?<br> Who?<br> Your wife.<br> Degrading yourself<br> for nothing.<br> It's a simple question.<br> She's pretty, okay?<br> Do we have to talk about this now?<br> I mean, did she really think a man like<br> that was gonna run away with her?<br> Possibly.<br> How pretty is she?<br> A knockout.<br> Beauty's overrated,<br> Sarah.<br> Brad had meant this<br> to be comforting.<br> But at 3:00 in the morning, it had<br> precisely the opposite effect.<br> He had a beautiful wife,<br> a knockout, and she was sleeping<br> beside him right now.<br> Only someone who took<br> his own beauty for granted<br> would have been able<br> to say something so stupid<br> and with a straight face.<br> Weekends were difficult<br> for Sarah.<br> separating one happy blur<br> of weekdays<br> from the rest.<br> I'm going to the ocean.<br> - You are?<br> - I'm going to the ocean.<br> Is he doing<br> his ocean dance?<br> Sarah sometimes let herself<br> be carried away by fantasies<br> of a future very different from the life<br> she was living now,<br> in which she and Brad were<br> free to love each other<br> in broad daylight;<br> where they had no one<br> to answer to<br> but each other.<br> It could happen,<br> she thought. It had to,<br> because she wasn't sure she<br> could keep living like this<br> for very much longer.<br> Open your mouth again.<br> No, I don't want to.<br> May your mouth<br> be open.<br> May your mouth.<br> This is coming<br> into your mouth.<br> Open your mouth,<br> little fishy.<br> Hungry, hungry.<br> Little fishy<br> is not hungry?<br> You okay?<br> Yeah, fine.<br> - How about you?<br> - Great.<br> So how was<br> your weekend?<br> You really wanna know?<br> It sucked.<br> How was yours?<br> Terrible.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, we went to the beach<br> and all Kathy and I did<br> was argue<br> the whole time.<br> Oh, you did?<br> Yeah, it was our<br> annual argument<br> over taking<br> the bar exam,<br> like our whole life<br> depends on it.<br> Get it over with.<br> You'll feel better.<br> It's this whole thing.<br> Gotta take a train<br> on Wednesday.<br> It's a two-day ordeal.<br> I'm not even<br> gonna pass.<br> - You'll be fine.<br> - No.<br> No, I won't.<br> I haven't cracked<br> a book all summer.<br> I missed you.<br> I missed you, too.<br> Don't-- don't do it.<br> - What?<br> - The test.<br> - Oh.<br> - Blow it off.<br> We should go somewhere,<br> just for a night,<br> you know?<br> Richard's out<br> of town till Friday,<br> and I'm sure I can get<br> a sitter for Lucy.<br> No, I can't do that.<br> I gotta take the test.<br> That's good.<br> - Looks good?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, I have a good<br> feeling about this whole thing.<br> In fact, I think I'm gonna go buy<br> a bottle of champagne<br> and put it in the fridge,<br> and we can open it to celebrate<br> when we get<br> the good news.<br> Don't get your hopes up.<br> We've been<br> through this before.<br> Huh-uh. This time's<br> gonna be different.<br> I can feel it.<br> Can you believe it?<br> This is our first date.<br> Like a date, you know,<br> without the kids, I mean.<br> How was Lucy?<br> Did she cry or anything?<br> No, are you kidding?<br> With Jean there, she<br> just about shoved me out the door.<br> I thought we could make something<br> really beautiful.<br> I have so<br> many things here.<br> We could make...<br> a picture frame.<br> Or a jewelry box.<br> Or a hat.<br> Something for my mommy.<br> Okay.<br> - Stop it, stop it.<br> - No, Ronnie.<br> Ron-- Ron-- Ronnie,<br> just hold on.<br> Now there.<br> You look handsome.<br> She won't be disappointed.<br> Wait'll she hears<br> about my criminal record.<br> I don't think you need<br> to get into that just yet.<br> Why don't you stick<br> to small talk?<br> What if someone<br> recognizes me?<br> That's highly unlikely.<br> I made the dinner reservation<br> at a restaurant over<br> in Haverhill.<br> Sheila.<br> - Sheila.<br> - Yeah.<br> Something wrong<br> with the food?<br> No, it's fine.<br> Back at the house you<br> mentioned you were on medication.<br> - What kind?<br> - All kinds.<br> Mostly psychotropic.<br> So you had some kind<br> of a breakdown?<br> Mm-hmm, my junior year<br> in college.<br> You were that young?<br> What happened?<br> I don't really know.<br> Well, nervous breakdowns<br> don't just come out of nowhere.<br> Something must have<br> caused it.<br> I guess.<br> But I was fine before<br> I left for college.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe it was the stress<br> of being on my own.<br> Maybe it's a chemical<br> imbalance in my brain.<br> Every psychiatrist I go to<br> has a different opinion.<br> This one guy, Dr. Faris,<br> he said I must have been<br> sexually abused as a child.<br> When I told him<br> I wasn't,<br> he said I must be<br> repressing the memory.<br> Right, um, so what<br> happened after that?<br> Did you drop out<br> of school?<br> Not right away.<br> My mother wanted me<br> to go<br> to the campus<br> counseling center.<br> And they wanted<br> the problem fixed, like I could just<br> snap my fingers and everything<br> would be okay again.<br> Yeah, I know<br> all about that.<br> You do?<br> Yes, I do.<br> So they said<br> I could leave school<br> and get married and have lots of kids<br> like my sisters,<br> and I can't take care<br> of kids.<br> I can't even take care<br> of myself<br> most of the time.<br> Besides, who's gonna marry me?<br> You're not so bad.<br> What?<br> You're--<br> you're not so bad.<br> I haven't had<br> a real boyfriend in six years,<br> not since my second<br> breakdown.<br> I had this thing happen<br> on a Greyhound bus.<br> - I was--<br> - Do you want me to wrap that up?<br> Oh, no, thank you.<br> No, wrap it up, please.<br> I'll take it home.<br> Folks gonna want dessert?<br> What do you say, Sheila?<br> You wanna share something sweet?<br> Let's make a little stop.<br> Take the next left.<br> Turn off the lights.<br> I had<br> a nice time tonight.<br> The last guy<br> I went out with,<br> you know what he did?<br> He ditched me.<br> He got up to go<br> to the men's room,<br> never came back.<br> Stuck me with the check.<br> Never said goodbye.<br> Never called<br> to apologize.<br> He wasn't my type anyway.<br> He was a big-shot CPA.<br> Super normal guy.<br> Didn't want to be dating some psycho.<br> But you seem like<br> a nice person.<br> Better not tell on me.<br> You hear me?<br> You better not tell,<br> or I'll fucking get you.<br> Hold on, Mom.<br> Hold on, Dad.<br> You should park the car<br> on the escalator, and back...<br> - So?<br> - What?<br> - Up, down and then up.<br> - Test, dummy. How'd it go?<br> It was all right.<br> You didn't call home<br> last night.<br> I was worried.<br> Go on the escalator.<br> Guess I could really use<br> that cellphone.<br> Go on the escalator.<br> - Well, look who's back.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> Hi, Jean.<br> Thanks.<br> You're a lifesaver.<br> So how was<br> your old roommate?<br> Oh, great.<br> Yeah, thanks for doing this<br> on such short notice.<br> Let me give you something<br> for your time.<br> That's not necessary.<br> No, really.<br> I insist.<br> Please don't.<br> Okay.<br> Uh, any calls?<br> Nope,<br> it was very quiet.<br> She's asleep on your bed.<br> It was a very busy day.<br> That's great.<br> Um, Jean,<br> is everything okay?<br> Yeah, she's<br> a wonderful child.<br> Mommy.<br> Mommy!<br> Yeah.<br> Are you coming?<br> - I have something.<br> - What?<br> I have something<br> for you.<br> Just give me<br> a second here, okay?<br> Brad.<br> Brad.<br> Hmm.<br> Aaron's been telling me<br> about his new friend Lucy.<br> She sounds like<br> a sweet little girl.<br> What's her mother like?<br> Nice enough, I guess.<br> I can't even<br> remember her name.<br> Isn't it Sarah?<br> Sarah?<br> Yeah, Sarah,<br> from the pool.<br> Her daughter's name<br> is Lucy.<br> Oh, Lucy's mom.<br> Yeah, I forgot. That's right.<br> Her name is Sarah.<br> Hmm.<br> Yeah, it might be<br> really nice for Aaron<br> if they came over<br> for dinner.<br> Okay.<br> So you're<br> in advertising?<br> No, that's-- that's<br> a common misconception.<br> I'm not in advertising.<br> I'm in branding.<br> And that's very different.<br> Richard's pretty high up<br> in the company.<br> Yeah yeah,<br> I have these clients<br> and they'll come to me<br> when they have,<br> you know, a new product<br> they wanna sell.<br> Like, um, these guys,<br> they were in a couple weeks ago.<br> They're trying to open this chain<br> of Chinese restaurants, right?<br> They're talking to me<br> and I-- I look down at the table<br> and I realize that none<br> of these guys were Chinese.<br> Where were they from?<br> They're a bunch of fat cats<br> from Tennessee.<br> They think they can start a chain<br> of Chinese restaurants good enough<br> to fool the average<br> American boob.<br> Oh, God.<br> Mmm!<br> - This is delicious.<br> - Isn't it?<br> Brad's a fantastic cook.<br> So you guys see these<br> fliers with the guy's face<br> plastered all over<br> our village?<br> Lots of Sturm und Drang<br> in our quiet little town, huh?<br> Yeah, it's crazy.<br> What I want to know is why they let<br> a creep like that out of prison.<br> Some of the people<br> going after him are just as crazy.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Well, just today I heard that<br> some nut's been spray-painting<br> the poor guy's house,<br> lighting fires on his porch.<br> God knows what else.<br> - Do they know who's doing it?<br> - Huh-uh.<br> They think<br> it's some ex-cop.<br> You know, that guy<br> who killed that kid at the mall.<br> Yeah, I don't think<br> it's him.<br> You're biased.<br> You're friends with the guy.<br> Brad's on that Committee<br> of Concerned Parents<br> with him.<br> I didn't know<br> you were on that.<br> I play on his<br> football team.<br> He asked me to distribute<br> some fliers.<br> He's on your team.<br> You never told me that.<br> Yeah.<br> You know what's weird?<br> I've never even seen this McGorvey guy.<br> - We did.<br> - No, we didn't.<br> Not you.<br> Me and Brad.<br> That day at the pool,<br> remember?<br> Yeah, I-I<br> totally forgot.<br> - Well, what happened?<br> - Sexual tension is an elusive thing,<br> but Kathy had<br> pretty good radar for it.<br> It was like someone had<br> turned a knob a hair to the right,<br> and the radio station<br> clicked in so loud and clear<br> it almost<br> knocked her over.<br> Once she became aware<br> of the connection between them,<br> it seemed impossible that<br> she'd missed it before.<br> On a hunch,<br> Kathy dropped her fork<br> in the hopes that<br> while retrieving it<br> she would catch Sarah<br> and Brad playing footsie,<br> - but she was mistaken.<br> - Asked him to leave, and he left.<br> But you know what?<br> He didn't look scary, right? I mean--<br> No, it-- it wasn't that big<br> of a deal, you know.<br> - No, he's like a regular guy, you know?<br> - Yeah, I mean--<br> Kathy, are you okay?<br> Uh, yeah.<br> Just a sec.<br> Brad had convinced<br> himself<br> the dinner party<br> had gone well.<br> That he and Sarah had managed<br> to put Kathy's suspicions to rest,<br> at least temporarily.<br> She certainly hadn't<br> accused him of anything,<br> or behaved in a way<br> that made him think<br> she'd noticed<br> anything untoward.<br> I'm really glad<br> they came over.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Two days later, however,<br> his mother-in-law showed up<br> for a surprise visit...<br> - Thank you, John.<br> - ...of ominously indeterminate length.<br> And from that moment on,<br> she accompanied Brad<br> and Aaron everywhere:<br> To the playground;<br> - We need some butter.<br> - To the supermarket;<br> And to the town pool.<br> Hi, Aaron.<br> Hi, Lucy.<br> The worst of it<br> was the pool.<br> Nevertheless,<br> after threatening all week<br> to go the football game,<br> Brad's mother-in-law decided against it<br> at the last minute.<br> - So are you coming?<br> - Well, I'd like to,<br> but I'm a little tired.<br> You sure?<br> You're welcome to.<br> No, go ahead.<br> You and Aaron<br> sure kept me hopping<br> this afternoon.<br> Looks like<br> you're on your own.<br> Oh, that's my ride.<br> - What time are you gonna be home?<br> - I don't know.<br> Pretty late, though.<br> Be careful and stay<br> out of trouble.<br> Winds whisper<br> of high hopes,<br> victory is in the skies.<br> One joins with many<br> on the summer's green field.<br> At 0 and 5, the Guardians<br> were the basement dwellers<br> of the Tri-County<br> Touch Football Night League.<br> The Controllers, a team of young<br> hotshots from the financial district<br> were 4 and 1<br> with an explosive offense<br> that regularly racked up<br> But from<br> the opening kickoff,<br> this ragtag group<br> of law enforcement officers<br> decided to crunch<br> their own numbers.<br> But the Controllers<br> scored first<br> after recovering<br> a Bart Williams fumble<br> deep in Guardians' territory near<br> the end of the second quarter.<br> The Guardians evened things up early<br> in the second half...<br> moving methodically<br> downfield<br> on an 80-yard<br> touchdown drive.<br> The Controllers regained the lead<br> with a fourth quarter field goal.<br> With less than a minute<br> to go, trailing by three,<br> the Guardians faced<br> the extinction of their hopes.<br> - Down!<br> - It was their last chance--<br> on their own 35.<br> Set!<br> Hut, hut!<br> Yeah yeah yeah!<br> Yeah yeah!<br> Yeah!<br> Oh my God!<br> Yeah!<br> Brad, Brad!<br> What do you want?<br> Everyone is waiting for us at the bar.<br> Are-- are-- are you coming?<br> Why don't you go on ahead?<br> I'll catch up later.<br> You're gonna come, right?<br> I mean, we gotta celebrate.<br> Yeah yeah yeah,<br> I'll be there.<br> - You promise?<br> - Jesus, Larry, I just told you.<br> - Well, you got a ride?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> I'll have a cold one<br> waiting for you.<br> Larry, you have<br> to go home now.<br> Just give me five more minutes.<br> He promised he was coming.<br> I don't care what he promised,<br> I want to lock up.<br> Now get your butt<br> out of here!<br> Now!<br> When I looked up there<br> and saw you it was just...<br> wow... wow.<br> Thank God you came.<br> I don't want<br> to go home.<br> I want to stay<br> right here forever.<br> No, I do.<br> For the first time in my life<br> I feel like anything is possible.<br> Like I can do anything, you know?<br> What are we doing?<br> What do you mean?<br> It's not real, Brad.<br> What?<br> This. It's wrong<br> and it's weird.<br> How long are we<br> gonna sneak around together?<br> How long can that last?<br> I can't do this anymore.<br> No, no don't<br> say that.<br> As long as I know that<br> we're gonna have this--<br> Have what?<br> What is this?<br> Look...<br> if that dinner at your house<br> was any indication,<br> you seem pretty happy<br> with your wife.<br> You know, you have<br> a perfect life<br> - and I don't wanna to be the--<br> - Okay, stop stop stop.<br> Run away with me.<br> What?<br> You don't mean that.<br> You believe in me.<br> Come on.<br> We'll go away,<br> figure this thing out.<br> It's not weird.<br> The kids are comfortable<br> with each other.<br> I know there's more<br> to it than that, but...<br> let's do this.<br> Please.<br> Please, Sarah.<br> Oh my God.<br> You really mean<br> it, don't you?<br> Yes.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.
