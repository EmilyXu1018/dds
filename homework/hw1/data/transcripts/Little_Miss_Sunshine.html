He's gonna join the Air Force Academy,<br> become a test pilot...<br> and he's taken a vow of silence<br> until he reaches that goal.<br> - You're kidding?<br> - Hi, Uncle Frank.<br> Oh, hey, Olive.<br> Wow, you're gettin' big.<br> Almost like a real person.<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - [ Olive Gasps ]<br> - What happened to your arms?<br> - Olive.<br> That's all right.<br> I had a little accident. I'm okay.<br> - How's the, uh, routine coming, honey?<br> - It's good.<br> Yeah? When are you<br> gonna show it to us?<br> I don't know.<br> It's up to Grandpa.<br> A couple of days.<br> It still needs work.<br> What's that? Chicken?<br> Every night it's the fuckin' chicken!<br> - Holy God Almighty! It is possible just once-<br> - Dad!<br> We could get something to eat around here<br> that's not the goddamn fucking chicken?<br> - Hey, Dad! Dad!<br> - I'm just sayin'-<br> - Christ.<br> - When you want to start cooking<br> your own food, you're welcome.<br> - At Sunset Manor, you know-<br> - If you like Sunset Manor,<br> you shouldn't have got kicked out.<br> For God's sakes.<br> So when did you start<br> with the vow?<br> Been nine months, Frank.<br> He hasn't said a word.<br> Not one. I think it shows<br> tremendous discipline.<br> - Richard.<br> - I really do.<br> Really. I think we could<br> learn something from Dwayne.<br> Dwayne has a goal.<br> He has a dream.<br> It may not be my dream,<br> may not be yours...<br> but he's pursuing it with<br> great conviction and focus.<br> In fact, I was thinking<br> about the nine steps-<br> Oh, for crying out loud!<br> And how Dwayne's utilizing seven of them<br> in his personal quest to self-fulfillment.<br> Richard, please.<br> Well, I'm just saying<br> I've come around.<br> I think he could use our support.<br> How did it happen?<br> - How did what happen?<br> - Your accident.<br> Honey, here.<br> [ Frank ] Oh, no, it's okay.<br> Unless you object.<br> No, I'm pro-honesty here.<br> I just think, you know, it's up to you.<br> Be my guest.<br> Olive, um, Uncle Frank<br> didn't really have an accident.<br> What happened was he...<br> tried to kill himself.<br> You did? Why?<br> [ Stammering ] I'm sorry. I don't think<br> this is an appropriate conversation.<br> Honey, let's let Uncle Frank<br> finish his dinner, okay? Shh.<br> Why did you want to kill yourself?<br> [ Richard ]<br> No, don't answer the question, Frank.<br> - Richard! Richard!<br> - He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.<br> - I wanted to kill myself-<br> - Don't listen to him.<br> - I was very unhappy.<br> - He's sick in his head.<br> - Richard!<br> - I'm sorry! I don't think it's<br> an appropriate conversation...<br> - for a seven-year-old.<br> - She's gonna find out anyway.<br> - Okay.<br> - Go on, Frank.<br> Why were you unhappy?<br> Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.<br> Mainly, though, I fell in love<br> with someone who didn't love me back.<br> Who?<br> One of my grad students.<br> I was very much in love with him.<br> Him?<br> It was a boy?<br> You fell in love with a boy?<br> - Yes, I did. Very much so.<br> - That's silly.<br> You're right. It was silly.<br> It was very, very silly.<br> - There's another word for it.<br> - Dad.<br> - So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?<br> - Well, no.<br> The boy that I was in love with fell in love<br> with another man- Larry Sugarman.<br> - Who's Larry Sugarman?<br> - Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...<br> the second most highly regarded<br> Proust scholar in the U.S.<br> - Who's number one?<br> - That would be me, Rich.<br> - Really?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> So that's when.<br> No. What happened was<br> I was a bit upset...<br> so I said some things<br> that I shouldn't have said...<br> and I did some things<br> that I shouldn't have done...<br> and subsequently<br> I was fired from my job...<br> and forced to move out of my apartment<br> and move into a motel.<br> [ Blowing Nose ]<br> - And that's when you tried to-<br> - Well, no.<br> Actually, all of that was okay.<br> What happened was two days ago the<br> MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...<br> awarded a genius grant<br> to Larry Sugarman.<br> And that's when l-<br> Decided to check out early.<br> Yes. Yes. And I failed<br> at that as well.<br> Olive, the important thing<br> to understand here...<br> is that Uncle Frank<br> gave up on himself.<br> He made a series of foolish choices-<br> I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...<br> which is something winners never do.<br> So that's the story, okay?<br> Now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh-<br> - [ Sheryl Continues ]<br> - Is he always like this? How can you stand it?<br> Olive, tell him about your<br> routine while you're doing this.<br> Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is<br> a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque...<br> but you have to be six or seven<br> and you have to be a girl.<br> This is our sister.<br> - Cindy.<br> - Spring break.<br> Dwayne went to see his dad<br> in Florida for two weeks...<br> and Olive went to Laguna<br> to see her cousins.<br> - She made it to the top<br> of the regionals out there.<br> - I was in second place.<br> Well, what do you think<br> your chances are?<br> I think I can win,<br> because some of the other girls...<br> they've been doing it longer,<br> but I practice every day.<br> - Yeah. Good luck.<br> - Not about luck, Frank.<br> Luck is the name losers give<br> to their own failings.<br> It's about wanting to win,<br> willing yourself to win.<br> - You've got to want it badder than anybody else.<br> - I do.<br> - Then you're gonna be a winner.<br> - [ Sheryl ] Richard.<br> It's the truth.<br> It's the truth.<br> You know, actually, there is a message<br> from Cindy on the machine.<br> Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.<br> - What? Little Miss Sunshine?<br> - Yeah.<br> What?<br> - [ Machine Beeps ]<br> - [ Woman On Machine ] Sheryl, it's Cindy.<br> Remember when Olive<br> was here last month?<br> She was runner-up in the<br> regional Little Miss Sunshine?<br> Theyjust called right now and said that<br> the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.<br> I don't know why.<br> Something about diet pills.<br> - Now she has a place in the state<br> contest in Redondo Beach!<br> - [ Screaming ]<br> - [ Continues, Indistinct ]<br> - [ Screaming Continues ]<br> Oh, my gosh! I won!<br> I won! I won! I won!<br> - [ Richard ] Finish your dinner!<br> - I'm finished!<br> - What happened?<br> - I'm just calling to- Cindy!<br> Yeah, we just got it.<br> Yeah, she basically went crazy.<br> - [ Olive ] I won! I won! I won!<br> - No, I didn't get that.<br> - The machine cut you off. Okay.<br> - [ Olive Continues, Indistinct ]<br> Redondo Beach. This Sunday?<br> - Wh-Are you guys going?<br> - [ Whispering ] Yes.<br> - Can you put it off?<br> - They have to. They have to.<br> - Where does that leave us?<br> - We can't do it. We can't.<br> No, no- No, I understand<br> that, Cindy. Yeah.<br> - They-<br> - I just- No, I'll just<br> figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.<br> It's this Sunday?<br> Why can'tJeff and Cindy take her?<br> They have some equestrian<br> thing in Santa Barbara.<br> You know, they do that horse<br> shit every single weekend.<br> Well, it's the nationals. They're taking<br> both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.<br> What about Olive?<br> Little Miss Sunshine!<br> Little Miss Sunshine! I won!<br> I won!<br> I'm going! We're going!<br> - You promised?<br> - We'll fly out and come back Monday.<br> - How are you gonna get around out there?<br> - We'll rent a car.<br> - And stay at a hotel?<br> - We can afford it.<br> - This is our seed money.<br> - Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.<br> - Don't start that.<br> - It all goes to your nine steps!<br> I told you I'm gonna talk<br> to Stan Grossman!<br> We're gonna get locked and loaded on this<br> deal and start generating some income!<br> - But in the meantime we've gotta be-<br> - Okay, okay! We'll drive!<br> - I'm not drivin'.<br> - How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?<br> - Well, Grandpa does not have to come.<br> - What? I coached her!<br> I gave her the moves.<br> I gotta go.<br> - Why don't you take the V.W.?<br> - I cannot drive a shift. I tried.<br> - We'll fly there.<br> - We can't afford it.<br> Well, that's what we're gonna do<br> unless you have a better idea.<br> Here. This is dessert.<br> I won! I won!<br> I won! I won! I won!<br> I won! I won! I won!<br> Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!<br> Little Miss Sunshine!<br> All right.<br> I'll drive the bus.<br> Richard, I was told explicitly<br> not to leave Frank by himself.<br> - No offense, Frank.<br> - None taken.<br> You got Dwayne here.<br> They can look after each other.<br> No, Richard! That's asking too much.<br> If something happened-<br> We can't go, then, unless<br> Dwayne and Frank go with us.<br> - [ Olive ] Mom, where's my bathing suit?<br> - Right.<br> Frank?<br> - I found it!<br> - [ Door Slams ]<br> Okay.<br> I'm going! I'm going!<br> I'm going!<br> Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.<br> Think of your sister.<br> [ Richard ] Come on, Dwayne.<br> It'll be a lot of fun.<br> You can go to the beach and-<br> [ Frank ]<br> "This is unfair.<br> "All I ask is...<br> that you leave me alone. "<br> Dwayne, flight school.<br> I will give you permission<br> for flight school.<br> [ Olive ] I won! I won! I won!
