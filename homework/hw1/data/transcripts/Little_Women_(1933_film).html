                        - So you're going to Washington?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> My son is sick in a hospital there.<br> This will be an anxious Christmas for you.<br> I think this one will do. Let's try this.<br> - Is it your only son?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> I had four, but two were killed<br> and one is a prisoner.<br> You've done a great deal<br> for your country, sir.<br> Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.<br> I'd go myself if I was any use.<br> Thank you for the overcoat.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I hope you find him better.<br> Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Mrs. March,<br> will you sign this so I can get it off?<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> When I see things like that poor old man...<br> ...it makes me ashamed<br> to think how little I do.<br> But, my dear, you're doing all you can here,<br> and your husband is there.<br> Yes, I know.<br> His last son is lying ill, miles away...<br> ...waiting to say goodbye to him,<br> forever perhaps...<br> ...while I have my four girls to comfort me.<br> And a real comfort they are, too,<br> aren't they?<br> I couldn't bear it without them.<br> - Meg and Jo are working, you know?<br> - Yes?<br> Meg is a nursery governess.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Remember, Lily,<br> Santa Claus is watching you.<br> Come on, Tony.<br> "We know as well,<br> what are the baneful fruits of selfishness...<br> "...and self-indulgence.<br> Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity...<br> "...even in the richest natures.<br> "They grow...<br> "...and ripen and bear their fruit...<br> "...like southern vines and weeds...<br> "...almost...<br> "...in a single day and night.<br> "Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly<br> from their very first appearance...<br> "...and do not weary...<br> "...of the labor of plucking them out...<br> "...again and again."<br> Goodbye, goodbye!<br> Hold your tongue,<br> you disrespectful old bird!<br> Go on, Josephine.<br> Josephine!<br> Where are you off to, Miss?<br> I didn't think you'd mind.<br> It was nearly time to leave<br> and the girls said they'd be home early...<br> ...so we could rehearse my play<br> for Christmas.<br> Never a thought about my Christmas.<br> Flying off without a word of cheer<br> or greeting for your poor old aunt.<br> I'm sorry, Aunt March.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> Here.<br> It's a dollar for each. Well, take them.<br> Thank you, Aunty.<br> Never mind thanking me.<br> Just spend it wisely, that's all I ask.<br> Although it's more than I can expect<br> when you're so much like your father...<br> ...waltzing off to war and letting<br> other folks look after his family.<br> There's nobody looking after us.<br> And we don't ask favors from anybody.<br> I'm very proud of Father<br> and you should be, too.<br> - Don't you be impertinent, Miss.<br> - I'm sorry, Aunty.<br> It isn't preachers that are going<br> to win this war. It's fighters!<br> Yes, Aunty.<br> - Can I go, now?<br> - Yeah, go on.<br> - Did you clean Polly's cage today?<br> - Yes, Aunty.<br> Did you wash those teacups<br> and put them away carefully?<br> Yes, Aunty.<br> - You didn't break any?<br> - No, Aunty.<br> - What about the teaspoons?<br> - I polished them.<br> Yes. Very well then.<br> Wait, just a minute. Come back here.<br> Look at this. You haven't dusted properly.<br> I want this stair rail dusted and polished<br> before you leave here.<br> Yes, Aunty.<br> Higher.<br> Thank you very much, ladies.<br> And now I wish you all<br> a very merry Christmas.<br> Merry Christmas!<br> School is dismissed.<br> Amy March! You may close the door.<br> That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.<br> - It serves that stuck-up Amy March right.<br> - What's he going to do to her?<br> I can see there's nothing for me to do<br> but to stop by and show your mother...<br> ...how instead of doing your sums,<br> you cover your slate with sketches.<br> And most uncomplimentary sketches.<br> Please, Mr. Davis, I'll never do it again, sir.<br> And she'd be so disappointed in me.<br> Please.<br> Please.<br> Well, I should hate to spoil her Christmas...<br> ...and for that reason alone, young lady,<br> I shall overlook it.<br> Thank you, Mr. Davis!<br> You may go.<br> Thank you, Mr. Davis.<br> Thank you very much indeed.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Here she is.<br> - What did he do?<br> - What did he say?<br> Come on, tell us. What happened?<br> I just said that if I ever told my mother<br> the way he treated me...<br> ...she'd take me out of his old school.<br> She's never been "reconciliated" anyway...<br> ...since my father lost his money<br> and she's had to suffer the "degaridation"...<br> ...of me being thrown in<br> with a lot of ill-mannered girls...<br> ...who stick their noses<br> in refined people's business.<br> Little tiny pussy, I'll tell you a long story.<br> - Hannah, is it teatime?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'll set the table.<br> - Thank you, Beth.<br> It'll be a help to me<br> 'cause my bread's raised.<br> The girls are getting home early.<br> - Are they coming?<br> - Just passing the Laurence house.<br> - Christopher Columbus!<br> - Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions.<br> Here comes old Mr. Laurence.<br> What if he heard you?<br> I don't care. I like good strong words<br> that mean something.<br> Oh, bother.<br> Now we're going to have to speak to him.<br> How do?<br> It makes my knees chatter<br> just to look at him.<br> I feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone<br> with such an ogre for a grandfather.<br> - Look, there he is.<br> - Where?<br> Don't point, Jo.<br> He'll think you're waving at him.<br> He's gone anyway. Well, what if he does?<br> Jo! Come along, Amy.<br> - How's my Beth?<br> - It's cold outside!<br> Jo just did the most terrible thing.<br> Beth, come over here.<br> - He waved at us.<br> - Is tea ready yet?<br> Merry Christmas from Aunt March.<br> - For me?<br> - Yes, darling, for you.<br> We got one, too.<br> - What are you going to do with it, dear?<br> - I don't know.<br> Marmee said we ought not<br> to spend money for pleasure...<br> ...when our men are suffering so<br> in the Army.<br> A dollar couldn't do the Army much good,<br> so I'm going to buy Undine and Sintram.<br> I've wanted it long enough.<br> I'm sure Marmee would approve<br> if I got some new gloves.<br> I've darned my old ones<br> until I can hardly get them on.<br> She always says a real lady is known<br> by her neat gloves and boots.<br> I shall get a nice box of Faber's<br> drawing pencils. I really need them.<br> Then I'd like to spend mine<br> for some new music...<br> ...that is,<br> if you don't think Marmee would mind.<br> Let's each buy what we want<br> and have a little fun.<br> I'm sure we work hard enough.<br> I know I do.<br> It's not the work I mind so much.<br> It's having to tell Flo King<br> how pretty she looks...<br> ...in things I know would look<br> as well on me.<br> What would you do if you were shut up<br> all day with an old crosspatch...<br> ...who flies off the handle<br> every move you make?<br> Jo, don't use slang.<br> Besides, don't forget<br> she gave us the dollar.<br> I'm sure neither of you suffer as I do.<br> You don't have to go<br> to that nasty old Davis' school...<br> ...with impertinent girls who laugh at you<br> and "label" your father 'cause he isn't rich.<br> "Libel." Don't say "label"<br> as if Papa were a pickle bottle.<br> I know what I mean<br> and you needn't be "statirical" about it.<br> It's proper to use good words<br> and improve your "vocabilary."<br> Aren't we elegant?<br> You'd never be thought so with your slang.<br> I hope not. I don't want to be elegant.<br> - You needn't whistle like a boy.<br> - That's why I do it.<br> - I detest rude, unladylike girls.<br> - And I hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks.<br> Birds in their little nests agree.<br> Really, you're both to blame.<br> You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks<br> and behave better, Josephine.<br> Now you are so tall and turn up your hair,<br> you must remember you're a young lady.<br> No, I'm not. And if turning up my hair<br> makes me so, I'll wear it down till I'm 100.<br> Jo!<br> As for you, Amy, your absurd words<br> are as bad as Jo's slang.<br> Your airs are funny now,<br> but you'll grow into an affected goose...<br> ...unless you take care.<br> If Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose,<br> what am I, please?<br> You're a dear and nothing else.<br> We're three ungrateful wretches<br> who don't deserve you.<br> Wait until I become a famous author<br> and make my fortune.<br> Then we'll all ride in fine carriages,<br> dressed like Flo King...<br> ...snubbing Amy's friends and telling<br> Aunt March to go to the dickens.<br> Let's rehearse.<br> We'll start with the fainting scene.<br> You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy.<br> Well, I can't help it.<br> I've never seen anyone faint...<br> ...and I don't intend to make myself<br> black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do.<br> It's easy if you'll only watch me. Come on.<br> - Lf I can drop gracefully, I'll...<br> - Now, when I come in...<br> ...you'll see the horrible look in my eyes<br> and you shrink back trembling.<br> Go ahead.<br> Get into the mood, Amy.<br> Now, when I start toward you,<br> with wicked intentions...<br> Oh, Amy, you...<br> ...draw back in horror,<br> covering your eyes with your hands.<br> "Roderigo, Roderigo!<br> "Save me, save me!"<br> There, now you see? Now, it's easy.<br> Now, here I come.<br> "Roderigo, Roderigo!<br> "Save me, save me!"<br> - You were marvelous.<br> - That was lovely.<br> Glad to find you so merry, my girls.<br> - Darling.<br> - Marmee.<br> - How is your cold, Meg?<br> - Much better.<br> Beth, dear, kiss me, baby.<br> Thank you, Jo. Thank you, dear.<br> - You look tired to death, Jo.<br> - No, Marmee, I'm not tired.<br> - Your slippers are all ready now.<br> - That's my Bethie, dearie.<br> Did you have a hard day, Marmee?<br> No, very pleasant, dear.<br> But it's good to be home.<br> - I have a treat for you.<br> - A letter from Father?<br> Three cheers for Father.<br> "Give them all my dear love and a kiss.<br> "Tell them I know they will remember<br> all I said to them:<br> "That they will be loving children to you...<br> "...they will do their duty faithfully,<br> fight their bosom enemies bravely...<br> "...and conquer themselves so beautifully...<br> "...that when I come back to them,<br> I may be fonder and prouder than ever...<br> "...of my little women."<br> I am a selfish girl...<br> ...but I'll truly try to be better<br> and not waste my time in school...<br> ...so that Father<br> may not be disappointed in me.<br> I'll try and be what he loves to call me,<br> "a little woman"...<br> ...and not be rough and wild,<br> and do my duty here at home...<br> ...instead of always wanting<br> to go to war to help Father.<br> I'm not going to be envious anymore,<br> if I can help it.<br> Now, we'll save the rest till after tea...<br> ...for it's such a lovely long letter.<br> I know everybody must be hungry.<br> Let's get something for Marmee<br> with our dollar...<br> ...instead of for ourselves, shall we?<br> That's like you, Beth. What shall we get?<br> - I'll get her a nice pair of gloves.<br> - New slippers, best to be had.<br> Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed.<br> A beautiful little bottle of cologne.<br> She'll like that, and it won't cost much...<br> ...and then I'll have some left over<br> for my pencils.<br> I've finished with Asia.<br> And here is Europe.<br> - Three stitches and you can have Africa.<br> - Not too long stitches, dear.<br> If you pass me the scissors,<br> I'll give you America.<br> There, you see? You did finish it after all.<br> You wanted to put it off until tomorrow.<br> But we never should have<br> if Jo hadn't made a game of it...<br> ...and thought of talking<br> of the different countries as we worked.<br> It was a nice idea, Jo.<br> Do you remember how you used to play<br> Pilgrim 's Progress when you were little?<br> I can see us all now with your ragbags<br> tied over our backs for burdens.<br> You have real burdens now,<br> instead of ragbags.<br> According to what I heard before tea,<br> except Beth.<br> She didn't say. Maybe she hasn't any.<br> Yes, I have.<br> Mine is dishes and dusters<br> and being afraid of people...<br> ...and envying girls with nice pianos.<br> A piano is a burden.<br> Good night, my precious.<br> Good night, Marmee.<br> - Good night, Jo, my girl.<br> - Good night, Marmee.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> - Good night, my baby.<br> - Good night, Marmee.<br> - Good night, Bethie.<br> - Merry Christmas, Hannah.<br> - Merry Christmas!<br> Where's Marmee?<br> She just went down the street,<br> but she'll be right back.<br> She wants you to have your breakfast<br> when I can get it dished up.<br> Come round here.<br> Hide them. Get close.<br> - Where have you been, Amy?<br> - What have you been doing?<br> Don't laugh, Jo.<br> I only changed the little bottle of cologne...<br> ...for a big one.<br> I gave all my money to get it.<br> - Amy.<br> - Darling.<br> That was unselfish of you.<br> You're some pumpkins, Amy.<br> I felt ashamed, thinking only of myself.<br> Amy, my prettiest rose.<br> And I'm so glad,<br> because mine is the handsomest now.<br> - Where is Marmee?<br> - She'll be back any minute. Breakfast!<br> - Hannah, I'm so hungry.<br> - Hannah, what is it?<br> Sausages!<br> Popovers!<br> They are my favorites!<br> Coffee!<br> Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch.<br> No need to make such a fuss about it.<br> I remember when I used to serve it<br> on your father's table every day.<br> No?<br> - Hannah, were we really that rich?<br> - How was I dressed?<br> I'd like to tell Jenny Snow<br> all the pretty clothes I used to wear.<br> - I can tell her. Diapers!<br> - Jo!<br> Two each.<br> - Isn't this marvelous?<br> - Look at all the popovers.<br> She's coming!<br> Hurry, Beth, strike up.<br> Amy, open the door.<br> Come here, Meg. We'll cover these up<br> and it'll be a surprise.<br> Enter, Marmee.<br> - Merry Christmas, Marmee!<br> - Merry Christmas, my...<br> Oh, darling!<br> Oh, Meg, dear! Thank you!<br> And handkerchiefs from Bethie. Thank you.<br> Hannah, did you see?<br> Amy, my precious, thank you!<br> These are from me.<br> Jo, my girl.<br> Thank you, darlings. Thank you.<br> Oh, my girls.<br> I can't tell you how happy I am.<br> Well, I can tell you how hungry I am.<br> Come on, everyone. Pass me those plates.<br> - Sit down, Marmee.<br> - Marmee, look! Sausages.<br> Wait a minute, girls.<br> I want to say one word before we begin.<br> I've just come from a poor woman<br> with a little newborn baby...<br> ...and six children huddled into one bed<br> to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.<br> They are suffering cold and hunger.<br> My girls, will you give them your breakfast<br> as a Christmas present?<br> I'm so glad you came back<br> before we started.<br> I knew you would.<br> May I carry some things?<br> We shall all go. Take the coffee, Hannah.<br> - I'll get some firewood.<br> - I'll take the cream.<br> I'll take the bread.<br> I'll take the popovers.<br> Here we are, Mrs. Hummel.<br> Gott in Himmel. Good angels come to us.<br> Funny angels, in hoods and mittens.<br> Do you want some bread to eat?<br> Here, I'll give you some bread.<br> Strange that Roderigo is not here.<br> His note says "promptly on the hour."<br> "And why..."<br> And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst?<br> I am afraid.<br> Who comes here?<br> Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag.<br> Black Hugo hath betrayed thee.<br> I must fly.<br> Zara will be waiting.<br> My proud beauty!<br> She will be mine!<br> Black Hugo approaches.<br> Withered crone, begone!<br> Roderigo, Roderigo!<br> Save me, save me!<br> And now to carry out my fell design.<br> What a fake.<br> Well, I told you<br> I wasn't going to make myself...<br> Have pity. Oh, have pity!<br> Bring not upon me the worst of shame!<br> Silence, else you'll rue the day<br> you spurned Black Hugo's love.<br> Make thyself ready for the wedding.<br> I shall return within the quarter.<br> Ah, me!<br> Heaven protect the helpless!<br> Zara! My beloved!<br> Roderigo, durst I believe my eyes?<br> "The pale stars are twinkling<br> "The fair moon is rising above<br> "My guitar is tinkling<br> "But the notes are not sweet<br> Till they bring me my love"<br> Courage, my fair.<br> The good padre waits<br> at yonder gate with the horses.<br> See, the ladder. All is arranged.<br> Liberty! Fly with me.<br> Fly with me, my love.<br> I will assist you. I will...<br> It's all right, everyone.<br> Stay where you are.<br> Young ladies.<br> Will you all please come in to supper?<br> Christopher Columbus! What's this?<br> Is it fairies?<br> - It's Santa Claus?<br> - Mother did it?<br> - Aunt March had a good fit and sent it?<br> - All wrong. Mr. Laurence sent it.<br> - No!<br> - Who is Mr. Laurence?<br> The Laurence boy's grandfather.<br> He lives next door.<br> He heard what you did<br> about your breakfast...<br> ...and sent me a nice note...<br> ...saying he hoped I'd allow him to express<br> his friendly feeling toward my children...<br> ...and send them a few trifles<br> in honor of the day.<br> The boy put it into his head, I know he did.<br> He looks like a capital fellow<br> and I'm dying to get acquainted.<br> I'm going to, too.<br> I wish Father were here.<br> I'm afraid he isn't having<br> such a merry Christmas as we are.<br> Hello.<br> How do you do?<br> I wanted to thank you.<br> We did have such a good time<br> over your nice Christmas present.<br> What's the matter? Are you sick?<br> Just a little cold, but grandfather's<br> made me stop indoors for a week.<br> That's too bad.<br> Can anybody come to see you?<br> If they would.<br> Wait, I'll ask Marmee.<br> Close the window now.<br> - How do you do, Miss March?<br> - How do you do, Mr. Laurence?<br> Mother was so sorry to hear<br> that you'd been ill.<br> My sister, Meg,<br> sent you some of her blancmange.<br> It's soft and will slide down easily<br> without hurting your throat.<br> Thank you.<br> And Beth lent you these until you're well.<br> I know boys don't like kittens,<br> but she was so anxious I couldn't refuse.<br> Maybe they'll help to liven things up.<br> It's as dull as tombs over here.<br> Won't you come in?<br> No, I'm not to stay.<br> Please. Just for a few minutes.<br> I've ordered tea.<br> Christopher Columbus!<br> What richness!<br> It's just like summer!<br> This is marvelous!<br> It's so roomy.<br> How many, please?<br> Two, please. Three.<br> How do you like it here after living<br> in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence?<br> I'm going to Europe.<br> - Really? When?<br> - I don't know.<br> My aunt has rheumatism<br> and the doctor thought the baths...<br> Not that she hasn't a bath.<br> She has a very nice one.<br> Did you take any baths<br> while you were there?<br> - I mean, for rheumatism.<br> - No, I'm not troubled with rheumatism.<br> Neither am I. But she thought<br> that baths wouldn't do me any harm.<br> I mean, that is to say, while I was there.<br> You see,<br> I've always wanted to go to Europe.<br> Not for the baths, of course,<br> but for my writing.<br> You see, my aunt...<br> But you don't know Aunt March, do you?<br> Well, never mind.<br> What were you saying, Mr. Laurence?<br> I'm not Mr. Laurence. I'm only Laurie.<br> Laurie.<br> How do you like it here after Europe?<br> It's strange<br> after living in schools all my life...<br> ...but it will be all right<br> when I get used to Grandfather.<br> You know, he...<br> Yes, you should have seen him<br> before you came.<br> - Isn't he a holy terror?<br> - You ought to see Aunt March.<br> It's too pretty to eat.<br> I wish we had things like this over here.<br> And I wish...<br> It is nice, isn't it?<br> My little sister put on the geranium leaves.<br> She's very artistic.<br> - Amy?<br> - Yes. How do you know?<br> I often hear you calling to one another...<br> ...and when I'm alone over here...<br> I beg your pardon for being so rude...<br> ...but sometimes you forget<br> to put down the curtains...<br> ...and when the lamps are lighted,<br> it's like looking at a picture...<br> ...to see you all around the table<br> with your mother.<br> You always seem to be having<br> such good times.<br> We'll never draw that curtain anymore.<br> And I give you leave<br> to look as much as you like.<br> I wish instead of just peeping,<br> you'd come over and see us.<br> We'd have jolly times together.<br> Would you let me be in a play?<br> I saw some of it the other night.<br> That was terrible.<br> I want to put on Hamlet<br> and do the fencing scene.<br> I could play Laertes.<br> I took fencing lessons at the academy.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, look.<br> Look. En garde!<br> - Splendid!<br> - Here.<br> "Come, for the third, Laertes,<br> you but dally."<br> "Say you so? Come on."<br> - "Another hit; what say you?"<br> - "A touch, a touch, I do confess."<br> What is this? What on earth?<br> What's going on?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> "Have at you now!"<br> I say...<br> - Are you hurt?<br> - No.<br> - No, nothing ever hurts me.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I forgot you were a girl<br> and I'm afraid I got a bit too rough.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I had you bettered if I hadn't slipped.<br> That's a good picture of your grandfather.<br> He looks pretty grim,<br> but I shouldn't be afraid of him.<br> Though I can see how his face<br> might frighten some people.<br> I'll wait upstairs, sir.<br> His eyes are kind and I like him<br> even though he does bark at you so.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> So you're not afraid of me?<br> No, sir, not much.<br> But my face will frighten some people?<br> - I only said "might."<br> - And I bark, do I?<br> No, sir, perhaps not all the time.<br> But with all that, you like me?<br> Yes, sir. I do.<br> I do.<br> And I like you.<br> Grandfather, you should see her fence.<br> Come on, let's show him.<br> - No. I've been here too long now.<br> - I'll see you home.<br> No, you stay indoors, young man.<br> I shall see Miss March home.<br> I want to pay my respects<br> to your mother...<br> ...and thank her for the medicine<br> she sent my boy.<br> I can see it's done him lots of good.<br> You get upstairs and do your sums.<br> Brooke is waiting for you.<br> And see that you behave yourself<br> like a gentleman, sir.<br> Goodbye, Jo.<br> Here they come.<br> All dressed up<br> and looking as pretty as pictures.<br> Amy, how dainty. You look lovely.<br> I wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party.<br> I know I shall be frightened.<br> You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings<br> when he's been so kind.<br> Meg, the dress is lovely.<br> Thank you, Marmee.<br> Jo, you look splendid.<br> I feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins...<br> ...all sticking straight into my head,<br> but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.<br> Does the patch show much?<br> It does a little, Marmee.<br> But she's going to sit down or else stand<br> with her back against the wall.<br> Jo, where are your gloves?<br> I've stained them, so I'm going without.<br> You wear gloves or I don't go.<br> I tried to clean them,<br> but it only made them look worse.<br> I'll carry them<br> and hold them crumpled up in one hand.<br> - Nobody will see them.<br> - Jo!<br> I'll tell you.<br> We'll each wear one of your nice ones...<br> ...and carry one of my bad ones,<br> then the effect will be fine and easy.<br> All right, only be careful of it,<br> and don't stretch it.<br> And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely<br> and don't put your hands behind your back.<br> Good night, Marmee.<br> Above everything, don't say:<br> "Christopher Columbus!"...<br> ...and disgrace us all.<br> Hold your tongue, Miss Baby.<br> I'll be as prim as I can be and not get into<br> any scrapes, if I can help it.<br> May I engage you for this dance,<br> Miss March?<br> No, thank you, I'm not dancing.<br> - There's that Kitty Ford.<br> - Where?<br> There in the pink dress and blue sash.<br> I don't see why she's allowed with<br> the grownups and I have to stay up here.<br> That beautiful piano.<br> It's as big as our kitchen.<br> What's this? Why aren't you young ladies<br> downstairs dancing?<br> Mother said we weren't to go down<br> with the grownups.<br> But can you see anything from here?<br> How about you?<br> She just likes to listen to the music.<br> You just come down with me<br> where it's playing.<br> - No, sir, please. I...<br> - Why not? What's the matter?<br> She has an infirmity.<br> She's shy.<br> I see.<br> If it weren't for that,<br> she'd be simply "fastidious"...<br> ...because she plays beautifully.<br> She must come and play for me sometime.<br> No, she never would.<br> It wasn't that I wanted to hear her.<br> But that piano down there<br> is simply going to ruin for want of use.<br> I was hoping one of you young ladies<br> would come and practice on it...<br> ...just to keep it in tune.<br> - But if you don't care to come, never mind.<br> - Sir.<br> We do care. Very, very much.<br> So you're the musical one.<br> I'm Beth. I love it dearly...<br> ...and I'll come if you're quite sure<br> nobody will hear me and be disturbed.<br> Not a soul, my child. Not a soul.<br> You come, too, young lady...<br> ...and tell your mother I think<br> all her daughters are simply "fastidious."<br> Beth, isn't he elegant?<br> This is the German, and I'll be hanged<br> if I'll let you refuse me all of them.<br> Don't you like to dance?<br> Yes, I love to dance, but I can't.<br> - I mean, I promised I wouldn't.<br> - Why?<br> - I may as well tell you. You won't tell?<br> - Silence to the death.<br> You see, I have a bad trick<br> of standing in front of the fire...<br> ...and I scorched my frock<br> and I burned this one.<br> Where?<br> You can laugh if you want to. It is funny.<br> I'll tell you how we'll manage.<br> There's no one in the hall.<br> We could dance there without being seen.<br> - You're a trump.<br> - And I think you're just perfectly splendid.<br> Hello.<br> What are you doing up there?<br> Come on down.<br> No, they can't.<br> Have you had refreshments?<br> No, thank you, we really don't care for...<br> We'll bring some right up. Come on.<br> Then when Laurie goes to college,<br> what becomes of you?<br> I shall turn soldier as soon as he is off.<br> I am needed.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I mean, I'm so sorry<br> for all the mothers and sisters...<br> ...who have to stay home and worry.<br> I have neither and very few friends<br> to care whether I live or die.<br> Laurie and his grandfather<br> would care a great deal.<br> And we all would be very sorry<br> if any harm came to you.<br> Would you?<br> Here we come.<br> Jo!<br> Now you've done it!<br> - Look at me.<br> - It's a shame.<br> What a blunderbuss I am.<br> What are you going to do?<br> I'll ask Marmee.<br> Have you two been hiding? I've been<br> looking all over the house for you.<br> Hannah's here.<br> - Is it that late?<br> - Time slips away.<br> - Good night, Mr. Brooke.<br> - Good night, Miss Margaret.<br> Miss Margaret?<br> - Goodbye. I'm glad you came.<br> - We had an elegant time.<br> Good night, Amy.<br> Good night.<br> - Good night, Laurie.<br> - Good night, Miss Margaret.<br> Laurie!<br> Good night, everybody.<br> - Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow.<br> - I won't.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> There, I've done my best.<br> If that won't do,<br> I'll have to wait until I can do better.<br> Why, what are you up to?<br> It's a pair of slippers<br> I worked for Mr. Laurence.<br> He's been so kind about letting me play<br> on his beautiful piano.<br> I didn't know any other way<br> to thank him, Jo.<br> - Do you think they're all right?<br> - They're beautiful.<br> And I think you're sweet.<br> Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon?<br> Yes, but I think<br> she was going to throw it away.<br> You think?<br> You'd better vamoose<br> before she catches you.<br> Now I'll find out why you come<br> to this hole every day.<br> Is that why you never have<br> any time for me anymore?<br> Laurie Laurence, give that to me<br> or I'll never speak to you again!<br> All right, take it.<br> You're a fine one.<br> I thought we weren't to have any secrets<br> from each other.<br> Well, this is altogether different.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Of course, it's different. Just like a girl.<br> Can't keep an agreement.<br> Oh, bilge!<br> You'll be sorry.<br> I was going to tell you<br> something very plummy.<br> A secret.<br> All about people you know, and such fun.<br> - What?<br> - Lf I tell you, you must tell me yours.<br> - You won't say anything at home?<br> - Not a word.<br> - You won't tease me about it in private?<br> - I never tease. Fire away.<br> I sold my story to the Spread Eagle.<br> Hurrah for Miss March.<br> Hurrah for Miss March!<br> The celebrated American authoress!<br> I didn't want anyone to know until it's out.<br> - Won't it be fun to see it in print?<br> - Now, what's yours?<br> - I know where Meg's glove is.<br> - Is that all?<br> - Wait till you hear where it is.<br> - Where?<br> - How do you know?<br> - I saw it.<br> - Where?<br> - Pocket.<br> - All this time?<br> - Isn't it romantic?<br> "Romantic"? Rubbish!<br> I never heard of anything so horrid.<br> I wish you hadn't told me.<br> Of all the sickly sentimental...<br> Why do things always have to change<br> just when they're perfect?<br> Meg always used to tell me everything.<br> Now she keeps things to herself.<br> She thinks brown eyes are beautiful<br> and John is a lovely name.<br> He'd better keep away from me<br> or I'll tell him what I think of him...<br> ...trying to break up other people's<br> happiness and spoil their fun.<br> It doesn't spoil any fun.<br> It makes it twice as good.<br> You'll find out<br> when someone falls in love with you.<br> Soft summer day.<br> Sun setting through the trees.<br> Your lover's arms stealing around you.<br> - I'd like to see anybody try it.<br> - Would you?<br> I'll get you!<br> Now I've got you.<br> Wait!<br> Look out, look out! Let me in, let me in!<br> - Hey, look out, Laurie. Don't act like that.<br> - I'm sorry, Meg.<br> I'd have beaten her though<br> if I hadn't tripped and fell.<br> You should have seen...<br> - It's been a most enjoyable afternoon.<br> - Thank you.<br> Paying visits has never been<br> quite so much fun before.<br> I hope we may do it again very soon.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Brooke. Come along, Meg.<br> - Good afternoon, Mr. Brooke.<br> - Goodbye, Miss Margaret.<br> - Good afternoon, Laurie.<br> - Goodbye, Jo.<br> - Coming, Laurie?<br> - All right. See you tomorrow, Jo.<br> I've never been so embarrassed in my life.<br> When will you stop<br> your childish romping ways?<br> Not until I'm old and stiff,<br> and have to use a crutch.<br> Jo!<br> - Hello, Bethie.<br> - Hello, Jo.<br> How's my girl?<br> There's a surprise.<br> - Come on and hurry up.<br> - Come on, Jo.<br> What is it?<br> Stop yelling. What is it?<br> Christopher Columbus!<br> For me?<br> Isn't it the most beautiful piano<br> you've ever seen?<br> Look, this came with it.<br> - Quick, read it. See what he says.<br> - I'll read it.<br> "To Miss Elizabeth March. Dear Madam."<br> How elegant.<br> "I've had many pairs of slippers in my life,<br> but none that suited me as well as yours.<br> "I like to pay my debts, so I know<br> you will allow me to send you something...<br> "...that belonged<br> to the little granddaughter I lost.<br> "With hearty thanks and best wishes...<br> "...I remain your grateful friend<br> and humble servant, James Laurence."<br> Oh, Bethie!<br> - Isn't he a really sweet old man?<br> - Look at these lovely brackets.<br> Look, it opens!<br> - You'll have to thank him.<br> - Yes.<br> I'll go right now.<br> Well, I wish I may die!<br> She'd never have gone in her right mind.<br> Come in.<br> I came to thank you, sir.<br> "But when the piece began, the dogs,<br> the dames and private ends went mad...<br> "...and bit the man.<br> "Around from the neighboring streets<br> the wondering neighbors ran...<br> "...and swore the dog'd lost his wits<br> to bite so good a man.<br> "The wound seemed sore and sad<br> to every Christian eye...<br> "...and while they swore<br> the dog was mad..."<br> Look, Marmee.<br> Ms. March!<br> Ms. March. It's one of them<br> telegraph things, ma'am.<br> It's Father.<br> He's in the hospital.<br> I must go to Washington at once.<br> Put those in the corner, dear.<br> What on earth is keeping Jo?<br> This is all packed, Marmee.<br> - I don't believe I've forgotten a thing.<br> - Thank you, dear.<br> While I'm away, don't forget the Hummel's.<br> - We won't.<br> - We'll do our best, Marmee.<br> Here we are. Here's some excellent port<br> for your husband.<br> - Thank you. How generous.<br> - I hope you find this dressing gown useful.<br> Everything's arranged<br> and Brooke will go with you.<br> There's no need. I'll be fine.<br> He's all prepared.<br> He has commissions for me in Washington.<br> - He'll be of help to you on the journey.<br> - How thoughtful of you.<br> It's such a relief to know that Marmee<br> will have someone to take care of her.<br> Thank you, very, very much.<br> Not at all, Miss Margaret.<br> My kind friend, I can't thank you...<br> Laurie's outside with the carriage.<br> We'll wait for you.<br> The train leaves in an hour.<br> Here, ma'am, you'll need this.<br> - I couldn't.<br> - Please, Marmee, take it.<br> Where is Jo?<br> - Jo, what kept you?<br> - Jo, whatever took you so long?<br> Here's the money from Aunt March.<br> And there's my contribution.<br> $25. Where did you get it?<br> - My dear!<br> - It's mine, honestly.<br> I only sold what belonged to me.<br> Your hair!<br> Jo, you shouldn't have done it.<br> Aunt March croaked, as she always does,<br> when asked for nine pence.<br> Marmee, she only sent you<br> just money enough for the ticket.<br> I knew you would need more...<br> ...so I happened to be going past<br> a barber shop...<br> ...and I saw some tails of hair<br> hanging in the window...<br> ...with the prices marked on them...<br> ...and I thought it would do my brain good<br> to have my mop cut off.<br> And so I did.<br> Thank you, dearie.<br> Are you ready, Marmee?<br> We'll have to hurry to catch...<br> Christopher Columbus!<br> Well, it's boyish, becoming,<br> and easy to keep in order.<br> - Marmee, you'll miss your train.<br> - Yes, Marmee, come on.<br> - Now, girls, go on with your work as usual.<br> - We will, Marmee.<br> Can't we go to the train with you,<br> Marmee?<br> No, I want you all to stay here<br> and comfort each other.<br> Meg, dear, watch over your sisters.<br> Be patient, Jo.<br> Jo, don't do anything rash.<br> Beth, dear, help all you can.<br> Amy, be obedient.<br> No, I want you to stay here.<br> I want to carry away a picture in my mind<br> of my brave little women to take to Father.<br> - Goodbye, my darlings.<br> - Goodbye, Marmee.<br> God bless us and keep us all.<br> Jo, are you awake?<br> Jo, you're crying.<br> No, I'm not.<br> Don't cry, dear.<br> Father will be all right<br> and Mr. Brooke will take care of Marmee.<br> I'm not crying because of that.<br> What then?<br> My hair.<br> "Yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas<br> glide through those fatal waters...<br> "...they still run crimson with the blood<br> of Lady Viella and her gallant lover...<br> "...slain by the phantom hand.<br> "The End."<br> It gives me the shivers.<br> I'm pins and needles all over.<br> It's so exciting and so sad. Who wrote it?<br> Your sister.<br> - Really, Jo?<br> - What?<br> Let me see.<br> - And I knew it all the time.<br> - Isn't that wonderful?<br> Here it is: "By Miss Josephine March."<br> Oh, Jo! I can't believe it!<br> Beth!<br> Jo's written a story and it's in the paper.<br> Isn't that marvelous?<br> - Really?<br> - Look!<br> Don't come near me.<br> Something's wrong with Beth.<br> What is it?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Where is she?<br> In Marmee's cupboard.<br> What's wrong? What's going on?<br> Darling, what is it?<br> Bethie, what is it?<br> - What's wrong, Bethie?<br> - What is it?<br> The baby's dead.<br> - What baby?<br> - Mrs. Hummel's.<br> It died in my lap...<br> ...before she got back with the doctor, Jo.<br> Now, there, there.<br> The doctor said it was scarlet fever.<br> - Scarlet fever!<br> - Hannah!<br> You don't think I'll get it, do you, Jo?<br> Oh, no, Bethie, of course you won't.<br> But Amy must keep away<br> 'cause she's never had it.<br> How does it start, Jo?<br> With a sort of a headache and sore throat...<br> ...and queer feelings all over?<br> I don't remember.<br> Laurie, give me that doctor's book.<br> Jo, I think we'd better get her to bed.<br> Come along, Bethie.<br> I'll find out what to do.<br> - I'll be all right.<br> - Of course you'll be all right.<br> Here it is.<br> Go get Dr. Bangs, will you, Mr. Laurie?<br> Have him come over as soon as he can.<br> You stay down here, Amy. You're to go off<br> to Aunt March's for a spell, just in case.<br> I won't! I'll stay right here with Beth.<br> Be quiet for once, Amy!<br> I'm not going to be sent away.<br> I advise you to go, Amy.<br> Scarlet fever's no joke.<br> Well, I don't care!<br> I'd rather get scarlet fever and die<br> than go to Aunt March's.<br> Now, Amy, be a good girl. I'll pop around<br> there every day and tell you how Beth is.<br> I'll tell you what. Every day,<br> I'll come and take you out driving.<br> - Well, yes.<br> - That's our girl.<br> Oh, Bethie, if you should really be ill,<br> I'll never forgive myself.<br> I let you go to the Hummel's every day<br> when I should've gone.<br> No, it's my fault.<br> I'm the oldest and I should've gone.<br> I promised Marmee I'd look after you.<br> Don't you think we ought to telegraph her?<br> No, we mustn't.<br> She can't leave your father and<br> it'll only make her all the more anxious.<br> Please don't telegraph, Jo.<br> Hannah knows just what to do.<br> I feel better already.<br> If Mrs. March can leave her husband,<br> we'd better send for her.<br> The girls had the telegram all ready,<br> but I wouldn't let them send it.<br> And now, the poor lady.<br> Oh, Mother.<br> What if she shouldn't get here in time?<br> Is it that bad?<br> She doesn't know me.<br> She doesn't look like my Beth.<br> How are we going to bear it?<br> Mother and Father, they seem so far away.<br> I'm here.<br> Hold on to me.<br> Jo, dear.<br> Poor Jo. You're all worn out.<br> What does the doctor say?<br> We're sending for Marmee.<br> If she were only here.<br> She will be. Grandfather and I got fidgety<br> and thought your mother ought to know.<br> She'd just never forgive us if Beth...<br> Well, if anything happened...<br> ...so I telegraphed yesterday.<br> She'll be here, on the 2:00 train tonight,<br> and I'm going to meet her.<br> Oh, Laurie! Oh, Marmee!<br> I beg your pardon, but you're such a dear.<br> I couldn't help flying at you.<br> Fly at me again. I rather like it.<br> Laurie, you're so silly.<br> I'd better go.<br> Well, to the railroad station.<br> And I shan't spare the horses.<br> Bless you, Laurie, bless you.<br> If you really want Bethie...<br> ...please wait until Marmee comes home.<br> But, God, please don't...<br> ...because she's so...<br> Please don't.<br> If God spares Bethie...<br> ...l'll love him and serve him all my life.<br> If life's as hard as this, I don't see<br> how we shall ever get through it.<br> What is it? What is it?<br> Goodbye, my Bethie.<br> Goodbye.<br> The fever's turned.<br> - She's sleeping naturally.<br> - The Lord be praised.<br> Marmee's here. She's come.<br> It's so wonderful to have Bethie with us.<br> Come on, everything's all ready.<br> Is she all right?<br> She's not very heavy, is she?<br> It didn't tire you, did it, dear?<br> See the lovely flowers<br> Mr. Laurence sent you.<br> And my birds.<br> I've never been so happy.<br> Begging your pardon,<br> do the Marches live here?<br> Wait till she sees what I brought for her.<br> Father, dear.<br> Father, is it really you?<br> I can't believe she's walking.<br> - Oh, my dear.<br> - She hasn't walked since she was ill.<br> Are you expecting someone?<br> Why, no. What do you mean?<br> Why can't we stay as we are?<br> Do you have to go and fall in love...<br> ...and spoil all our peace and fun<br> and happy times together?<br> You're not like your old self a bit.<br> And you're getting so far away from me.<br> Meg, don't.<br> Don't go and marry that man.<br> I don't intend to go and marry any man.<br> And if you mean Mr. Brooke,<br> he hasn't asked me.<br> If he should, I shall merely say<br> quite calmly and decidedly:<br> "I'm sorry but I agree with Mother<br> that it's too soon."<br> Oh, Meg! Hurrah for you! You're a trump.<br> My hair.<br> Then things will be as they used to be,<br> and now that Father's home...<br> I'll go. I'll get out of the way.<br> Now don't forget.<br> If I could only see his face<br> when you tell him.<br> Why, Mr. Brooke.<br> Good day, Miss Margaret.<br> Won't you come in?<br> I came to get my umbrella.<br> That is to see<br> how your father finds himself today.<br> Why, he's here in the rack.<br> I mean, it's very well.<br> I mean...<br> I'll tell him you're here.<br> Oh, please.<br> Are you afraid of me, Margaret?<br> How could I be<br> when you've been so kind to Father?<br> I only wish I could thank you for it.<br> You can.<br> - Shall I tell you how?<br> - No.<br> Please don't.<br> I only want to know<br> if you care for me a little, Meg.<br> I love you so much, dear.<br> Thank you, John.<br> I agree with Mother, it's too soon.<br> I'll wait. I don't mind how long<br> or how hard I have to work...<br> ...if I can only know<br> I'm to have my reward in the end.<br> Please, give me a little hope.<br> I'm afraid I can't.<br> Do you really mean that?<br> What's this?<br> What's he doing here? Get along.<br> What's going on here? Who is that?<br> Mr. Brooke.<br> The Laurence boy's tutor. Then it's true.<br> He might hear you.<br> He's been so kind to Father.<br> Well, he'll be much kinder<br> if he goes about his own business...<br> ...and leaves you alone. I won't stop.<br> I'm only thinking of your own good,<br> Margaret.<br> You should make a rich match<br> to help your family.<br> This rude person has no money,<br> no position in life.<br> That doesn't mean he never will have.<br> So he's counting on my money.<br> He knows you've got rich relatives.<br> Aunt March,<br> how dare you say such a thing.<br> My John wouldn't marry for money<br> any more than I would.<br> I'm not afraid of being poor.<br> And I know we shall be happy<br> because John loves me and I love him.<br> Hoity-toity.<br> Remember this, young lady:<br> If you marry this rook or hook or crook,<br> he'll take care of you.<br> Not one penny of my money will he get.<br> My darling, did you mean it?<br> I came back for my umbrella<br> and I couldn't help hearing.<br> Then you will give me leave<br> to work for you and love you?<br> Yes, John.<br> "And there to have given<br> and pledged their troth each to the other...<br> "...and have declared the same by giving<br> and receiving a ring and by joining hands...<br> "...I pronounce that they are man and wife.<br> "In the name of the Father,<br> of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<br> "Amen."<br> "God the Father, God the Son...<br> "...and God the Holy Ghost...<br> "...bless, preserve and keep you...<br> "...that ye may so live together<br> in this life...<br> "...that in the world to come<br> ye may have life everlasting.<br> "Amen."<br> The first kiss for Marmee.<br> Well, John, you've been a traitor.<br> I hope you'll take care of her.<br> You're a lucky fellow, John.<br> - Goodbye, Amy.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Don't mind, Jo.<br> You've still got me.<br> I'm not good for much, I know...<br> ...but I'll stand by you...<br> ...all the days of my life.<br> I know you will.<br> You don't know<br> what a comfort you are to me, Laurie.<br> - Jo...<br> - No, don't say it.<br> I will, and you must hear me.<br> It's no use, Jo.<br> You've kept away from me<br> ever since I got back from college.<br> I studied so hard<br> and I graduated with honors, all for you.<br> - I know, and I'm so proud of you.<br> - Then won't you listen?<br> Please.<br> I've loved you ever since I've known you.<br> I couldn't help it.<br> I've tried to show it,<br> but you wouldn't let me.<br> Now I'm going to make you hear it<br> and give me an answer...<br> ...for I just can't go on so any longer.<br> I know I'm not half good enough for you.<br> But if you love me,<br> you can make me anything you like.<br> As though I'd change you, Laurie.<br> You should marry some lovely,<br> accomplished girl who adores you.<br> Someone who would grace<br> your beautiful home.<br> I shouldn't.<br> I loathe elegant society and you like it.<br> And you hate my scribbling<br> and I can't get on without it.<br> And we should quarrel.<br> - No, we shouldn't.<br> - Yes, we always have, you know.<br> Everything would be horrid<br> if we were ever foolish enough to...<br> Marry? No, it wouldn't, Jo.<br> It would be heaven.<br> Don't disappoint us, dear. Don't.<br> Everybody expects it.<br> Grandfather has set his heart on it.<br> And I just can't go on without you.<br> Please, say you will.<br> I can't.<br> Laurie, I'm sorry.<br> So desperately sorry.<br> I'm so grateful to you,<br> and so proud and fond of you.<br> I don't know why I can't love you<br> the way you want me to.<br> I've tried, but I can't change the feeling...<br> ...and it would be a lie to say I do if I don't.<br> Really truly, Jo?<br> Really truly, dear.<br> I don't think I'll ever marry.<br> Yes, you will.<br> You'll meet some good-for-nothing,<br> no-account idiot...<br> ...and you'll fall in love with him,<br> and work, live and die for him.<br> I know you will. It's your way.<br> And I'll have to stand by and see it.<br> Well, I'll be hanged if I do.<br> Where are you going?<br> To the devil, and I hope you'll be sorry.<br> Laurie, please...<br> Why aren't you in bed? It's late.<br> Mother, I want to go away.<br> I mean, just for a little while.<br> I don't know. I feel restless and anxious<br> to be doing something.<br> I'd like to hop a little way<br> and try my wings.<br> Where would you hop?<br> To New York.<br> I've thought about it a lot lately.<br> You can spare me now.<br> I could go to Mrs. Kirke's and help<br> with the children as part of my board.<br> It wouldn't cost much,<br> and I'd see and hear new things...<br> ...and get a lot of new ideas for my stories.<br> I don't doubt it.<br> Jo, nothing's happened<br> between you and Laurie?<br> Don't be surprised, dear.<br> Mothers have to have sharp eyes...<br> ...especially when their daughters<br> keep their troubles to themselves.<br> Oh, Marmee, I'd have told you,<br> only I thought it would blow over...<br> ...and it seemed kind of wrong<br> to tell Laurie's poor little secret.<br> It's only that he's got<br> a foolish romantic notion in his head...<br> ...and I think if I go away for a time,<br> he may get over it.<br> I see.<br> And how do you feel<br> about this "foolish romantic notion"?<br> I love him dearly as I always have.<br> I feel as though<br> I've stabbed my dearest friend.<br> And yet, I don't want to make a mistake.<br> You're right, Jo. I think it would be<br> a good idea for both your sakes.<br> Now, come to bed, dear.<br> I'll talk to Father about it.<br> And if he agrees, we'll write to Mrs. Kirke.<br> - Good night, dear.<br> - Good night, Marmee.<br> Now, my dear,<br> I think I've told you everything...<br> ...and it will be a great load off my mind<br> knowing the children are safe with you.<br> I'm very busy so I'll have Mamie<br> show you to your room.<br> Mamie!<br> I've given you a little inside room.<br> It's all I had...<br> ...but it has a table<br> and you can use it for your writing.<br> That's great.<br> Mamie!<br> You must come down here some<br> after dinner and be sociable.<br> I promised your mother<br> I wouldn't let you be homesick...<br> ...and I have only the most refined people<br> in my house.<br> Mamie!<br> Here I am, Ms. Kirke.<br> Mamie, this is Miss Josephine.<br> Will you take her up to her room<br> and find the children?<br> I'll see you later, my dear.<br> Right this way, please.<br> Children, children!<br> They ain't a bad lot but, my stars,<br> they take a deal of handling.<br> Jimmy! Kitty!<br> You heard me.<br> Come on out, I know where you are.<br> The bear's going to eat my baby.<br> Save my poor baby.<br> My baby! Don't eat my baby!<br> Professor!<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Please. I'm so sorry.<br> This is Miss Josephine<br> what's got you in charge now.<br> - Hello.<br> - How do you do?<br> - And this is Professor Bhaer.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Come on, let's finish the game.<br> - I want to play some more.<br> That is for Miss Josephine to say,<br> but we've frightened her already.<br> Oh, no, but I didn't expect to meet<br> a grizzly bear in the upper hall.<br> Mamie, wait.<br> The back is too young<br> to carry such heavy loads.<br> Come on, children, let's play soldiers.<br> Tina, you are the general.<br> You're the captain. And here, Lieutenant.<br> Forward march!<br> He's such a lovely man.<br> I know he must've been a gentleman<br> sometime or other...<br> ...but he's as poor as a church mouse now.<br> What does he do?<br> He's a professor, see?<br> He learns them how they talk<br> in foreign countries.<br> I don't know what good it does them<br> when they're living right here.<br> Good evening, my little friend,<br> good evening.<br> Please, don't stop.<br> It was beautiful.<br> I've heard you play it often<br> and wanted to ask you what it was.<br> I'd so like to send it to my little sister.<br> Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt.<br> The words are by Goethe.<br> Do you speak German?<br> Then I'd better give it to you in English.<br> Let's see now.<br> "Only who knows what longing is<br> "Can know what I suffer<br> "Alone and parted far from joy<br> and gladness<br> "My senses fail<br> "A burning fire devours me<br> "My senses fail<br> "A burning fire devours me"<br> I know how he felt.<br> Tchaikovsky did, also.<br> That is why he wrote this beautiful,<br> heartbreaking music.<br> If only I could write something like that.<br> Something splendid<br> that would set other hearts on fire.<br> That is genius.<br> Do you wish to write, my little friend?<br> Yes, that's my longing.<br> I've sold two stories already<br> since I've been here.<br> That is very good.<br> I'd like to read them. May I?<br> Would you?<br> I'd so like to know your opinion.<br> I would be very happy.<br> You have the ardent spirit. I like that.<br> What shall I ask for at the music shop?<br> I think I'd better write it down for you.<br> Well, now,<br> here is a teacher without a pencil.<br> Let me sew that button for you<br> before you lose it.<br> No, I sew on buttons.<br> Not very well, evidently.<br> Well.<br> - Who was Goldilocks, a little girl?<br> - Yes.<br> "And she...<br> "...went into their house...<br> "...and saw three chairs.<br> "Three chairs.<br> "One was the baby one,<br> one was the daddy one...<br> "...and one was the mommy one.<br> "So she sat down in the big one...<br> "And it was too hard."<br> Miss Josephine,<br> you're to go to the parlor right away.<br> Someone to see you.<br> - Who is it?<br> - I can't tell you. It's a surprise.<br> All right, children, that will be all for today.<br> Now run along and wash your hands<br> and faces for tea.<br> - I'll finish the story tomorrow.<br> - All right.<br> - Who is it, Mamie?<br> - I can't tell you. It's a surprise.<br> Are these some of your new stories?<br> Oh, they look...<br> ... creepier than The Duke's Daughter.<br> Can I read them?<br> Yes, if you want to.<br> " The Place of the Coventrys<br> or The Secret of a Guilty Heart...<br> "...by Josephine March."<br> Then it's true.<br> - Amy!<br> - Darling!<br> - Aunt March!<br> - Josephine.<br> I'm so glad to see you.<br> What took you so long to get down?<br> Tell me everything.<br> We can't stop now.<br> We've got to get to the shipping office<br> before it closes.<br> Shipping office? Aunt March, Europe?<br> I'm taking Amy with me.<br> Well, maybe you can go next time.<br> Next time?<br> Tell me, is Meg all right?<br> And Marmee and Father?<br> And how's my Beth?<br> She's better again,<br> but she isn't rosy as she used to be.<br> Oh, my poor Beth.<br> Why doesn't she get strong?<br> And Laurie?<br> Didn't you see them when they were here?<br> He and his grandfather<br> have been in Europe for weeks.<br> Laurie in New York?<br> And didn't come to see me?<br> I'm sure you can't blame him<br> after the way you picked up...<br> ...and trotted off without so much<br> as saying goodbye to any of us.<br> I think you've treated everybody<br> shamefully.<br> Come along, Amy.<br> Jo, dear, I wish it were you.<br> I know how you've always longed to go.<br> No, darling. It's your reward.<br> You've always done sweet things<br> to please Aunt March.<br> Think of all the wonderful things<br> you are going to see:<br> The Turners,<br> the Raphaels and the Leonardos.<br> You seem to forget<br> waiting cabs cost money.<br> That's the trouble with folks<br> who never had anything.<br> Easy come, easy go.<br> We'll be right back, Josephine.<br> Goodbye, darling.<br> Miss Josephine?<br> Yes, Professor Bhaer.<br> I have read your stories<br> and I would like to return them to you.<br> Will you please come in?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Did you like them?<br> Well, Miss March, I must be honest.<br> I was disappointed.<br> Why do you write<br> such artificial characters...<br> ...such artificial plots, villains,<br> murderers and such women?<br> Why don't you write a...<br> Miss March, please. I am so sorry.<br> I didn't want to hurt you.<br> I wanted to help you.<br> What a blundering fool I am.<br> It isn't that.<br> Please, don't pay any attention to me.<br> Forgive me, please. Come, sit down.<br> Forgive me.<br> No, it's just that everything seems<br> to come at once.<br> The rest doesn't matter so much.<br> I can bear that.<br> But Laurie, I can never get over Laurie.<br> Herr Laurie, your friend.<br> - Something has happened to him?<br> - Yes.<br> No, something has happened to me.<br> He came to New York<br> and he didn't even come to see me.<br> What a fool he must be.<br> No, it's my fault. But I thought that...<br> What does it matter what I thought?<br> I've made a mess of it<br> as I do of everything.<br> But I have tried and when I think<br> of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe...<br> ...when she always promised<br> she'd take me...<br> ...not that I begrudge Amy the trip, but...<br> I suppose that's just what I am doing.<br> That trip to Europe<br> that you so looked forward to.<br> That is too bad.<br> That is a cruel disappointment, I know.<br> On top of it, that stupid professor.<br> He comes blundering<br> and makes things worse.<br> No. If I can't stand the truth,<br> I'm not worth anything.<br> I didn't think those stories<br> were so very good.<br> But you see...<br> ... The Duke's Daughter<br> paid the butcher's bill...<br> ... and the Curse of the Coventrys<br> was the blessing of the Marches...<br> ...because it sent Marmee and Beth<br> to the seashore.<br> Yes, that is what I have thought.<br> And then I have said to myself:<br> "I maybe have no right to speak."<br> But then again, I said to myself:<br> "I maybe have no right to be silent."<br> Miss March, you have talent.<br> - Do you really think so?<br> - Otherwise I could not say.<br> And you know that.<br> And I say to you,<br> "Sweep mud on the street first...<br> "...before you are false to that talent."<br> Say to yourself:<br> "I will never write one single line<br> which I have not heard in my own heart."<br> Say to yourself, "While I am young...<br> "...I will write these simple,<br> beautiful things that I understand now.<br> "Maybe later, when I am a little older<br> and I have felt life more...<br> "...then I will write<br> about these poor wretches...<br> "...but I will make them live and breathe<br> like my Shakespeare did."<br> - Will you do that, my little friend?<br> - Yes, I'll try.<br> But I don't think I'll ever be a Shakespeare,<br> do you?<br> But you can be a Josephine March.<br> And I assure you that is plenty.<br> And now,<br> don't be disappointed about that trip.<br> - Here.<br> - Peppermint, good.<br> Those of us who have been<br> all over the Old World...<br> ...can find many things in the New...<br> ...that are beautiful and young.<br> Miss March,<br> it would give me great pleasure...<br> ...if I could show you some<br> of these things while you are here.<br> If you would care to have so.<br> Thank you.<br> Then you are not angry<br> with the blundering professor...<br> ...who takes the wrong times<br> for his lectures?<br> How could I be?<br> Auf Wiedersehen, my little friend.<br> Did you really like it?<br> - I never had such a...<br> - Happy, my little friend.<br> She was divine.<br> I don't want to be a writer anymore.<br> I want to be a wonderful singer<br> and thrill thousands of people...<br> ...so that they cheer<br> and throw flowers at me like that.<br> Bravo. Bravo.<br> But I wouldn't make up my mind so soon...<br> ...because at the art museum<br> you wanted to be a sculptress...<br> ...at the circus you thought<br> the bareback rider...<br> ...was the most beautiful thing<br> in the world.<br> I know, but to sing like that!<br> I forgot.<br> Something inside me tonight<br> makes me want to shout.<br> What would you shout?<br> I'd say, "Look at me, world.<br> I'm Jo March and I'm so happy."<br> My little friend, you are happy.<br> You haven't missed much lately<br> your home and your old friends?<br> But you're responsible for that.<br> Maybe they haven't missed me<br> so much either.<br> They're so busy with Meg<br> and those blessed babies.<br> Yes, how are those remarkable twins?<br> Wonderful. Meg's so proud of them.<br> Have you heard from Europe?<br> Nearly every boat<br> brings a letter from Amy.<br> And your friend...<br> ... Herr Laurie, have you heard from him?<br> Only through Amy. They met at Vichy<br> and had a wonderful time together.<br> Miss March, I am bold to ask a favor.<br> Would you give me the address<br> of your father?<br> I wish to write him and ask him something.<br> Why, yes.<br> He'd be so happy to hear from you.<br> They almost know you.<br> I've told them all about you.<br> And they always ask after you<br> in their letters.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, now I'll show you.<br> This is so nice.<br> Not I hope...<br> It's Beth. She's...<br> I must go at once.<br> My friend, can I do something for you?<br> I'm sure there is something I can do.<br> No, there's nothing. Thank you.<br> Oh, Jo...<br> ...to think you're home.<br> If Amy were here, we'd all be together.<br> She'll be home in the spring, darling.<br> And I'm going to have you all well<br> and rosy by then.<br> Poor Jo, you mustn't be afraid.<br> Doesn't that sound funny...<br> ...me saying that to you<br> when you've always said it to me?<br> You've always reminded me...<br> ...of a seagull, strong and wild...<br> ...and fond of the wind and the storm...<br> ...dreaming of flying far out to sea.<br> And Mother always said<br> that I was like a little cricket...<br> ...chirping contentedly on the hearth...<br> ...never able to bear the thought<br> of leaving home.<br> But now...<br> ...it's different.<br> I can't express it very well.<br> I shouldn't try to, to anyone but you...<br> ...because I can't speak out<br> to anyone but my Jo.<br> I'm not afraid anymore.<br> I'm learning that I don't lose you,<br> that you'll be more to me than ever...<br> ...and nothing can part us,<br> though it seems to.<br> Oh, Jo.<br> I think I'll be homesick for you<br> even in heaven.<br> The little loves.<br> - I'm afraid they're tiring you.<br> - Oh, no.<br> It's time for my little regiment<br> to take its nap.<br> - They're sweet.<br> - Yes.<br> I think I can sleep now.<br> Look, Jo, my birds.<br> They got back in time.<br> - Bethie!<br> - Mother!<br> My daughter!<br> Bethie!<br> Oh, Marmee.<br> We mustn't cry.<br> We must be glad she's well at last.<br> No, Marmee, don't cry.<br> If only there were another boat<br> leaving sooner.<br> Now, my dear, you've been so brave,<br> you must be patient.<br> We're going back on the very first boat.<br> I still think you should obey<br> your mother and stay.<br> I know. But I'm sick for home, Aunt March.<br> I hate all this now.<br> If it weren't for this, I'd have been there,<br> at least to say goodbye.<br> Laurie, I knew you'd come.<br> My child!<br> Mr. Laurence!<br> Amy, we were in Germany,<br> and Marmee's letter had to be forwarded...<br> ...but I came the moment I got it<br> because...<br> Well, you must comfort me now, too.<br> I'm so thankful you're here.<br> I haven't known what to do with the child.<br> Perhaps you can persuade her to stay.<br> - The elegant young matron.<br> - Hello, Jo, dear.<br> I've Sally Moffat's carriage.<br> I'm making some calls.<br> You want me to mind the demons<br> while you're gone?<br> No, I want you to go with me.<br> Jo, dear. It's a lovely day<br> and I want to talk to you.<br> Talk to me now.<br> You know I can't bear calls.<br> - How's your story coming?<br> - Sent it off yesterday.<br> - Without us reading it?<br> - You can read it when they send it back.<br> - I had a letter from Amy.<br> - So did Marmee.<br> They're in Valrosa now<br> and she says it's paradise.<br> Jo, I'd like to ask you something.<br> I've been wondering...<br> ...how would you feel...<br> ...if you should hear that your Laurie<br> was learning to care for somebody else?<br> Meg, who?<br> Amy?<br> I don't know. I can't be sure.<br> I'm only reading between the lines.<br> Then you wouldn't mind?<br> No, Meg. How could I?<br> I think it would be wonderful, don't you?<br> Yes, but I wasn't quite sure.<br> Forgive me, dear...<br> ...but I have so much<br> and you seem so alone.<br> I thought lately<br> that maybe if Laurie came back...<br> No, dear. It's better as it is.<br> And I'm glad if he and Amy<br> are learning to love each other.<br> You're right about one thing though.<br> I am lonely and maybe<br> if Laurie had come back...<br> ...I might've said yes.<br> Not because I love him any differently,<br> but because...<br> ...it means more to me now<br> to be loved than it used to.<br> Laurie.<br> Oh, my Laurie!<br> Jo, dear. Are you glad to see me?<br> Glad?<br> My blessed boy!<br> Words can't express my gladness.<br> And where's your wife?<br> They all stopped in at Meg's,<br> but I couldn't wait to see you.<br> They'll be along presently.<br> Let me look at you.<br> Don't I look like a married man<br> and the head of a family?<br> Not a bit, and you never will, although<br> you have grown bigger and bonnier.<br> But you're the same scapegrace as ever,<br> despite that very elegant mustache.<br> - You can't fool me.<br> - You have to treat me with more respect.<br> Jo, dear, I want to say one thing,<br> then we'll put it by forever.<br> No, Laurie, please.<br> I think it was always meant to be,<br> you and Amy.<br> It would have come about naturally<br> if only you'd waited.<br> As you tried to make me understand.<br> But you never could be patient.<br> So then we can go back<br> to the happy old times?<br> The way you wanted it,<br> when we first knew one another.<br> We never can be boy and girl again, Laurie.<br> Those happy old times can't come back.<br> We shouldn't expect them to.<br> We're man and woman now,<br> we can't be playmates any longer.<br> But we can be brother and sister,<br> to love and help one another...<br> ...all the rest of our lives, can't we, Laurie?<br> There they are.<br> You look very well, Aunt March.<br> After the money spent on my rheumatism,<br> I come home on a day like this.<br> Heaven's to Betsy. If she ain't dressed<br> in silk from head to foot.<br> Where is she? Where is Jo?<br> - Jo!<br> - Amy!<br> Doesn't she look marvelous, Jo?<br> I'll never forgive myself<br> for staying away so long...<br> ...and leaving you<br> to bear everything all alone.<br> Darling.<br> To think that only yesterday we were<br> pulling our hair and buttoning pinafores.<br> And now she's a grown-up married lady<br> with a bustle.<br> You must be famished.<br> I'll help Hannah with the tea.<br> No, you won't, Marmee.<br> You'll sit right here. I'll help Hannah.<br> It's fun, isn't it, Bethie?<br> Now that we're all together again.<br> Oh, dear. I've got to get some milk.<br> I haven't enough for my babies.<br> I'll go.<br> - But it's raining cats and dogs.<br> - I love it.<br> Sakes alive! There's the front doorbell.<br> - Is this the residence of Miss March?<br> - Why, yes.<br> - Miss Josephine March?<br> - Yes.<br> May I speak with her?<br> She's out,<br> but I'm expecting her back any minute.<br> - Won't you come in?<br> - Thank you.<br> No, thank you. She has guests, no.<br> Thank you very much.<br> But will you please give this to her<br> and tell her Professor Bhaer left it?<br> Thank you.<br> Professor Bhaer. Thank you very much.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Herr Professor.<br> - My little friend.<br> I was just here to leave your book.<br> I wanted to tell you my friend published it,<br> and he has great hopes.<br> - He thinks...<br> - Never mind what he thinks.<br> Did you like it?<br> My little friend, it has such truth,<br> such simple beauty.<br> In English quick,<br> I cannot tell you what it gives my heart.<br> But you were going without telling me.<br> If I hadn't come back,<br> I never would've seen you again.<br> - Come, you're getting wet.<br> - I couldn't intrude. You have guests.<br> No, only my family.<br> My sister has just come home.<br> She is married to that boy I told you about.<br> - Herr Laurie?<br> - Yes.<br> This is the first time<br> we've all been together for a long time.<br> Please, just one moment before...<br> I had a wish to ask you something.<br> Would you...<br> I have no courage to think that...<br> But could I dare hope that...<br> I know I shouldn't make so free as to ask.<br> I have nothing to give but my heart so full<br> and these empty hands.<br> Not empty now.<br> Heart's dearest!<br> Welcome home.<br>
