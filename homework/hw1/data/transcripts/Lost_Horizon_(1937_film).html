You.<br> Good heavens, no.<br> Not I.<br> Well who, for instance.<br> In time, you will know.<br> You know for a man who<br> talks a great deal,<br> it's amazing how<br> unenlightening you can be.<br> There are some things<br> my dear Conway,<br> that I deeply regret<br> I cannot discuss.<br> Shall we continue?<br> You know, in the outside<br> world, you'd be a knockout.<br> I bet people would fight<br> to see you dance.<br> I fear I shall never see<br> you're outside world.<br> Never see it? Why ever not?<br> It is not possible.<br> Am I then, in some way<br> on trial dear Mr. Chang.<br> Oh no, like everyone else<br> you are on a pilgrimage<br> through life.<br> By chance, out of your voyage<br> of discovery, is here.<br> By chance?<br> Here of course, we have<br> more time for reflection.<br> Sickness is unknown.<br> Perfect health is the rule.<br> And it is quite common for us<br> to live to a very ripe old age.<br> Indeed.<br> And does that also apply to those who<br> come here from the outside world.<br> If it did not, Shangri-La<br> would never have been built.<br> How old it is your<br> oldest inhabitants?<br> Um? Let me see?<br> Considerably over 100 years old.<br> Considerably.<br> Yes, still at work,<br> when last I spoke to him.<br> Climate and diet, these are important<br> of course to keep you young.<br> But we believe it is the lack<br> of struggle in our way of life.<br> How often in your countries<br> do you hear the expression,<br> "He worried himself to death."<br> or " this thing or that<br> thing killed him."<br> Your lives are, as<br> a rule shorter.<br> Not so much by natural death<br> as by indirect suicide.<br> Unfortunately true.<br> "Climate, diet, and<br> harmony." you said.<br> And somewhere the guiding mind.<br> Is that it?<br> Is it not enough?<br> What worries me is that<br> it's a little like a dream,<br> from which I shall shorty,<br> but unpleasantly, awake.<br> You surprised me.<br> I surprised you?<br> Yes, as you who have written<br> so much of better worlds<br> should think it a dream<br> when you find one.<br> Or is it that you fail to recognize one<br> of your own dreams when you see it.<br> And this is our school.<br> This is where we start to prepare<br> our young for the future.<br> Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why.<br> The world is a circle<br> without a beginning<br> And nobody knows where<br> it really ends.<br> Everything depends<br> on where you<br> Are in the circle<br> that never begins,<br> Nobody knows where<br> the circle ends.<br> La la la, la la-la la, la la.<br> And just because you<br> think you're small,<br> That doesn't mean that<br> you're small at all.<br> And just the way<br> a tiny branch<br> is like a tree to a twig,<br> To someone else you are big.<br> The world is a circle<br> without a beginning,<br> And nobody knows where<br> it really ends.<br> Woooa!<br> Everything depends<br> on where you<br> Are in the circle<br> that's spinning around.<br> Half of the time we<br> are upside down.<br> La-la-la<br> La la la, la la-la la, la la.<br> And just because they<br> say you're weak,<br> That doesn't mean<br> you've a weak physique.<br> And even if they're<br> partly right,<br> At least they're<br> partially wrong.<br> To someone else<br> you are strong.<br> And just because they<br> say you're slow,<br> That doesn't mean that<br> you're slow, you know.<br> And even if you're<br> never first,<br> Compared to someone<br> who's last,<br> They're sure to<br> think you are fast.<br> The world is a circle<br> without a beginning,<br> And nobody knows where<br> it really ends.<br> Woooa!<br> Everything depends<br> on where you<br> Are in the circle<br> that never begins.<br> Nobody knows where<br> the circle ends.<br> La-la-la<br> La la la, la la-la la.<br> The world is a circle<br> that never begins.<br> Nobody knows where<br> the circle ends.<br> - Oh.<br> - Children.<br> Thank you.<br> Sometime in the future, you shall<br> have the pleasure of meeting her.<br> Sam, Sam I had the strangest<br> dream last night.<br> I dreamt I swallowed a<br> And when I woke up<br> my pillow was gone.<br> - You're getting better.<br> - I thought so.<br> - You go on. I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - OK, hurry it up.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, I thought<br> you were alone.<br> What is it?<br> Lovett had a deck of cards.<br> I thought you'd...<br> might like to play a game.<br> Some other time, huh?<br> Sure.<br> I didn't think I<br> could hold a card.<br> Why am I like this?<br> It helps talking to you.<br> My little cold knot in my<br> stomach starts easing up.<br> My memory<br> keeps coming back, that I<br> really considered dropping<br> off this balcony.<br> Would you have done so?<br> I don't know.<br> If Chang hadn't called,<br> then maybe I would.<br> That's what frightens me.<br> What's happened to me?<br> Perhaps you can<br> answer that yourself.<br> Sally, "Golden Girl."<br> I was always taught,<br> dreams could come true.<br> That's terrific to believe<br> when you're a kid.<br> A little more difficult later on when<br> you're a "little more difficult."<br> All that passionate involvement.<br> Men, causes.<br> Going around agonizing about<br> man's inhumanity to man.<br> I made a good living out of taking pictures<br> of people with their heads blown off.<br> So other people with<br> their heads still on<br> and usually under hair dryers<br> could get a kick out of them before<br> turning to the nearest recipe.<br> One day it all made me sick.<br> The dreams were over.<br> That is very painful but,<br> also necessary so that you<br> may take the next step.<br> The next step was to start taking<br> pills to get the dreams back.<br> The excitement, the loving,<br> the feeling good ones.<br> The kicks I got, lasted about<br> two and a half minutes.<br> So you find out, that's<br> not the answer either.<br> And now?<br> Nothing.<br> - The end of the line.<br> - No!<br> You had the courage,<br> not to jump.<br> Which means?<br> You must tell me.<br> Answers!<br> Where the hell are any answers!<br> I don't know!<br> Try Miss. Hughes.<br> Inside me I guess. Is that it?<br> It would not be wrong<br> to start there.<br> - May I help you with some tea Mr. Conway?<br> - Thank you.<br> Let me see. 19 plus 187<br> gives me a grand total of<br> two hundred and six.<br> You know if you hadn't told<br> me you were honest Harry,<br> I'd swear you were cheating.<br> Of course I'm cheating Sampson,<br> and getting away with it.<br> I mean there's no fun<br> playing cards if you don't.<br> And the rest of us, are we all<br> as content as we seem here or<br> is there some delicious<br> drug in our food?<br> Or is all this, a mirage?<br> No, no no no my dear Mr. Conway, we<br> employ no such methods in Shangri-La.<br> To put it simply, we<br> believe in moderation.<br> We teach that virtue<br> lies in avoiding excess.<br> We rule with moderates<br> strictness.<br> In return we are satisfied<br> with moderate obedience.<br> As a result our people<br> are moderately sober.<br> Moderately chase and err...<br> moderately honest.<br> Then you're more than<br> moderately fortunate.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> Well, I brought you this.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> - May I look at it?<br> - Yes.<br> Do you ever have<br> arguments over women?<br> Oh, only very rarely.<br> You see, it would not be<br> considered good manners<br> to take a woman that<br> another man wanted.<br> And supposing somebody wanted<br> some particular woman so badly,<br> he didn't care whether it<br> was good manners or not.<br> Well in that event.<br> It would be good manners on<br> the part of the other man...<br> To eh<br> Yes?<br> To let him have her.<br> That's very convenient.<br> I think I like that.<br> And ah, does this arrangement<br> applied for women also?<br> Of course. You'd be surprised Mr. Conway<br> how a little courtesy all around<br> can help to smooth out the<br> most complicated problems.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hope it has a happy ending.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Excuse me.<br> Just a minute.<br> Yes Mr. Conway.<br> I'm in a quandary and ah<br> I thought that<br> you might be able to help me.<br> I noticed you are having your<br> course in elementary Chang.<br> What is your problem?<br> Well, Chang tells me that as<br> soon as I meet a woman I like<br> I must be prepared to give her up<br> if somebody else likes her as well<br> and I don't think I'm<br> capable of doing that.<br> - When that happens<br> - I think it has.<br> When that happens<br> the important thing<br> is to try and make the other fellow,<br> the one who must be courteous.<br> I see, I hadn't thought<br> of it like that.<br> Perhaps you could help me<br> with some other questions.<br> I have so many I hardly<br> know where to begin.<br> You want to know who I am<br> and what I'm doing here.<br> - My name is Catherine and I was born here.<br> - Were you?<br> Well, almost born here. It<br> was just beyond the pass.<br> My parents were explorers who couldn't<br> rest until they had seen everything.<br> Unfortunately, they died<br> just on the other side.<br> And Chang rescued you.<br> Fateful Chang, he and his<br> men found me barely alive.<br> Here I've grown up and<br> here I've been happy.<br> With no desire to leave.<br> Absolutely none.<br> So I should know a good<br> thing when I see it.<br> Is that it?<br> That's it.<br> Goodnight Mr. Conway.<br> Well my friends you have seen our<br> mountains our valley and our people.<br> You've heard about our past,<br> now you are seeing our future.<br> This is our Festival<br> Of The Family.<br> A chosen couple perform a ritual,<br> honoring the newly born children.<br> Start with a man<br> and you have one<br> Add on a woman and<br> then you have two.<br> Add on a child and<br> what have you got?<br> You've got more than three.<br> You have what they<br> call a family.<br> Living Together, Growing<br> Together, just being together,<br> that's how it starts.<br> Three loving hearts all<br> pulling together, working<br> together, just building together,<br> that makes you strong.<br> If things go wrong we'll<br> still get along somehow,<br> living and growing together.<br> It just takes wood<br> to build a house.<br> Fill it with people<br> and you have a home.<br> Fill it with love and<br> people take root.<br> It's just like a tree<br> where each branch<br> becomes a family that's<br> Living Together, Growing<br> Together, just being together,<br> that's how it starts.<br> Three loving hearts all<br> pulling together, working<br> together, just building together,<br> that makes you strong.<br> If things go wrong we'll<br> still get along somehow,<br> living and growing together.<br> Living Together, Growing<br> Together, just being together,<br> that's how it starts.<br> Three loving hearts all<br> pulling together, working<br> together, just building together,<br> that makes you strong.<br> If things go wrong we'll<br> still get along somehow,<br> living and growing<br> just like we're doing<br> now, together.<br> Yeaahhh!!<br> Seems like I've had<br> so little time.<br> All through my life<br> Maybe that's why<br> I've always been<br> so impatient.<br> I must learn to be patient<br> or I might frighten her away.<br> Seems like I've had<br> just too much time<br> All through my life<br> Maybe thats why<br> Ive seemed to be<br> So unhurried, somethings<br> just should be hurried<br> Or they might<br> frighten him away<br> Seemed like were part<br> of two different world<br> In the way we live<br> More than in just<br> a few things<br> that mean we both<br> a lot to give<br> Learning how we do things<br> Sharing new things<br> Looking back I see that<br> Ive always been alone<br> All through my life<br> Maybe I knew<br> when it was time<br> Love would find me<br> I must just let it find me<br> Or it might<br> frighten her away<br> Yes it might<br> frighten him away<br> If we rush we may loose<br> What we may have found<br> today.<br> Mmmmh,<br> Mmmmm,<br> Hi.<br> Ah, improving your<br> mind again eh?<br> You should try it.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, maybe you're right.<br> Then perhaps I can<br> understand what it is<br> about this place that the rest<br> of you seem to enjoy so much.<br> Tell me, don't you ever give<br> a thought to leaving here?<br> No. I dont know<br> what you left behind<br> but what I left behind, I'm not<br> in such a hurry to see again.<br> Aw.<br> Don't listen to her Maria.<br> She was born to be a recluse.<br> Hello Maria. I saw you dance at the<br> ceremony, and you were lovely.<br> Thank you.<br> I've read these and I've<br> come back for more.<br> I wonder what will happen<br> when we've read them all.<br> We'll be about 250 and<br> need new glasses.<br> You sound like you hate<br> the outside world.<br> - Do you?<br> - Well I don't love it.<br> But what about London and Paris?<br> And the Greek islands and<br> the Leningrad Ballet.<br> You mean compared to hear? Oh,<br> Maria you must be kidding.<br> Look what you got, plus all the<br> time the world to enjoy it.<br> Time, Yes there is time.<br> Before George came, it didn't seem<br> strange to spend my days in reading.<br> Talk to myself, dance.<br> Drift through the days full of<br> nothing but peace and quiet.<br> It didn't seem too long,<br> but it's different now.<br> Oh boy, good old George.<br> Take it from me Maria, Shangri-La has<br> a definite edge over New York City,<br> not to mention<br> Calcutta and the rest.<br> But the way George describes it.<br> Listen Marie, George is a nice guy<br> and I don't mean to knock him,<br> but don't let him kid you there's<br> some sort of wonderland outside.<br> So all you have is<br> peace and quiet uh-uh.<br> You have a place here<br> where you can breathe.<br> Where no violence, no cruelty.<br> A place where people will<br> take the time to care.<br> George can have his rat race.<br> I can do without it.<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> First of all is noise<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> Is peace and quiet<br> I would like to try it<br> Different people look at life<br> from different points of view<br> If you really want the things<br> I have just help yourself<br> I give it all to you<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> I would mention crowds<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> Is open spaces<br> Why can't we change places?<br> Different people look at life<br> from different points of view<br> If you really want the things<br> I have just help yourself<br> I give it all to you<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> I would mention work<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> Is contemplation<br> Sounds like a great vacation<br> Different people look at life<br> from different points of view<br> If you really want the things<br> I have just help yourself<br> I give it all to you<br> Different people look at life<br> from different points of view<br> If you really want the things<br> I have just help yourself<br> I give it all to you<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> Most of all is rain<br> On the list of the things<br> that I will not miss<br> Is too much sunshine<br> Can there be too<br> much sunshine?<br> Different people look at life<br> from different points of view<br> Different people look at life<br> from different points of view<br> If you really want the things<br> I have just help yourself<br> They're yours<br> I give it all to you<br> You know, those girls would<br> be great in my new act.<br> They should be so lucky.<br> You look beautiful.<br> Thanks. I guess.<br> Oh I mean, you looked beautiful<br> before but now, you look beautiful.<br> Tomorrow I got<br> something to tell you.<br> What's wrong with today?<br> I can't now, it's a secret.<br> Alright.<br> I'm afraid that truces over.<br> Why?<br> If we don't get it straight<br> now we never will.<br> Get what straight?<br> Who wants to leave,<br> and when and how.<br> For start, I want you to<br> tell them what you told me.<br> That we were brought<br> here deliberately.<br> And what's the point.<br> They're perfectly happy.<br> They won't be when<br> they find out.<br> Will you tell them?<br> No, and certainly not tonight.<br> Then I will.<br> Listen everybody.<br> My brother wants to<br> explode a small bomb but<br> I think I better do it.<br> Sit down George.<br> Do you realize that we<br> are all prisoners here?<br> No we're not, we're guest.<br> We were deliberately kidnapped.<br> - What is this?<br> - You have no proof of that.<br> The pilot of a plane was<br> a man from Shangri-La.<br> - May have been.<br> - Stop glossing over the facts.<br> I want to get out of here.<br> I can't do it alone<br> I need to know if anyone<br> else feels as I do?<br> Well, does anyone<br> else want to leave.<br> Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway.<br> Ask him if you don't believe me.<br> Why were we kidnapped and<br> brought here Mr. Chang?<br> Mr. Conway I'd bring you<br> extraordinary news.<br> Answer the question.<br> - Let him go. - Richard! - Let him go!<br> Mr. Chang,<br> Forgive my brother's determination<br> to force the issue.<br> You've been very kind<br> and we appreciate it.<br> But I think the time has come for<br> you to be more open with us.<br> Were we brought here<br> deliberately and if so why?<br> There is no time to answer<br> questions now Mr. Conway.<br> You must come at once. The<br> High Lama wishes to see you.<br> Who is the High Lama?<br> I thought you ran<br> this place Chang.<br> Oh no, I'm only a humbled<br> member of the community.<br> - Please Mr. Conway, you must<br> - Just a minute.<br> Will your High Lama<br> answer our questions?<br> That is possible.<br> Then he's the man<br> that I want to see.<br> Richard?<br> Tell him that, I at least<br> intend to leave here.<br> I was here for five years<br> before I was called.<br> You cannot appreciate<br> the overwhelming<br> honor that has been<br> bestowed upon you.<br> It is unprecedented.<br> Good evening Mr. Conway.<br> Please come in.<br> Sit down near me.<br> I trust, you have been comfortable<br> at Shangri-La since you arrival.<br> I've liked it very much.<br> But some of my friends and in particularly<br> my brother are puzzled by the mystery.<br> I can understand<br> that Mr. Conway.<br> Perhaps if I told you<br> of Shangri-La's origins<br> things would become clearer.<br> Thank you.<br> A Belgian priest named<br> Father Perrault<br> was was the first European to enter<br> the valley of the Blue Moon.<br> When was that?<br> Was the year 1747.<br> When Father Perrault tumbled into<br> the valley half frozen to death,<br> one of his legs was<br> so badly frostbitten,<br> there being no doctor he was<br> forced to amputate it himself.<br> - He amputated his own leg?<br> - Yes.<br> Oddly enough, later, when the<br> natives came to trust him.<br> He learned from them that<br> his leg would have healed<br> without amputation.<br> - With frostbite that's impossible.<br> - Oh no.<br> This valley celebrates<br> the natural life.<br> And he recovered well.<br> Soon he was making his<br> way around the valley<br> taking a great interest<br> in everything.<br> He taught his own religion<br> and the best of others.<br> Instructing the children<br> knowing how important education<br> would be for future generations.<br> He began building the<br> Lamasery of Shangri-La<br> with one or two helpers.<br> But after some years<br> hundreds of the natives<br> who by now had come to respect<br> him helped with the task.<br> When it was finished<br> he was 108 years old.<br> He's life works is over.<br> He became weak and lay in his room for<br> many weeks between life and death.<br> And then a strange<br> thing happened.<br> He had a vision<br> of the purpose<br> of Shangri-La, of<br> its entire meaning.<br> And of his part in it.<br> From that moment on<br> he began to recover.<br> And how old was he when he died?<br> But that's incredible!<br> Yes my son.<br> You're still alive<br> Father Perrault.<br> Sit down my son.<br> You may not know it, but I've been an<br> admirer of yours for a great many years.<br> Of mine, Father?<br> Oh, not the Richard Conway, the<br> public hero, the government servant<br> but the Richard Conway<br> who once wrote,<br> "There are moments<br> in every man's life<br> when he glimpses the eternal."<br> That man seemed to belong here.<br> In fact, it was suggested<br> that someone be sent<br> to bring him here.<br> So I was right, we<br> were brought here.<br> But, what possible use could I be<br> to an already thriving community?<br> If this community is<br> to continue to thrive,<br> then we need men like you here.<br> You can work today.<br> Is there anything more pitiful.<br> Will surely this is<br> a time of crisis.<br> But when has the world<br> known any other time.<br> What madness there is<br> what blindness, what<br> unintelligent leadership.<br> A furiously harassing marshall,<br> bewildered, humanities, strengthening,<br> not in wisdom but<br> in vulgar passions.<br> The time must come when<br> evil will destroy itself.<br> I will not live to see that day.<br> But you might, my son.<br> And that is why you have<br> been brought to Shangri-La.<br> For when the day comes, that the<br> world begins to look for a new life,<br> it is our belief<br> that they will find a<br> reservoir of hope here.<br> So here we shall stay with<br> our books and our music.<br> And our medications.<br> Here we shall be, to guide the<br> footsteps of a weary people.<br> Here we shall be with<br> our way of life.<br> There's only one simple rule, <br> be kind.<br> And it is our hope<br> that our brotherly love will then<br> spread throughout the world.<br> And when the strong have<br> devoured each other,<br> then, at last<br> the meek shall<br> inherit the earth.<br> I am tired now my son.<br> Will you come again?<br> Yes I will.<br> How do I know this is<br> part of my real life?<br> If there's no pain can<br> I be sure I feel life?<br> And would I go back if<br> I knew how to go back?<br> What good is time when<br> you're sure of tomorrow?<br> Can there be joy where<br> there has been no sorrow?<br> And would I go back if<br> I knew how to go back?<br> Will I find there is really<br> such a thing as peace of mind,<br> and what I thought was living<br> was truly just confusion,<br> the chance to live forever<br> is really no illusion,<br> and this all can be mine?<br> Why can't I make<br> myself believe it?<br> Can I accept what<br> I see around me?<br> Have I found Shangri-La,<br> or has it found me?<br> And would I go back if<br> I knew how to go back?<br> Will I find there is really<br> such a thing as peace of mind,<br> and what I thought was living<br> was truly just confusion,<br> the chance to live forever<br> is really no illusion,<br> and this all can be mine?<br> Why can't I make<br> myself believe it?<br> There are things that you see.<br> Other things you feel.<br> Feelings can't be seen yet we<br> never doubt they are real.<br> When you search for the truth<br> don't just use your eyes.<br> Look inside yourself that is<br> where the truth always lies.<br> Where knowledge<br> ends faith begins,<br> and it shines like a star,<br> till your heart fills<br> with hope and with love.<br> I have looked in your heart.<br> I have faith in you.<br> No not there.<br> I apologize for<br> being away so long.<br> Well, did you ask about- What was<br> he like? - Richard, did you see him?<br> Yes.<br> I saw the High Lama.<br> And I haven't the answers to all of our<br> questions yet, but I will in time.<br> And when I do I'll tell you<br> exactly what the situation is.<br> Particularly about going home.<br> Until then you all<br> have to trust me.<br> Come on, come on,<br> Oh my lord.<br> - There, gold, the stream is full of it.<br> - So?<br> We can smuggle it out. Get<br> those porters to help us.<br> Correction, you bribe the porters,<br> I got something better to do.<br> Such as?<br> Such as not sitting around<br> worrying about how to<br> spend money in a place where<br> money isn't any good.<br> But what about when we get out?<br> Get out, how? Sam you<br> gotta' be more practical.<br> Trouble with you is you haven't<br> got any inner resources.<br> Who hasn't? What are<br> you trying to tell me?<br> Your life is made up of<br> infinite possibilities<br> and you're not<br> realizing one of them.<br> - Not one.<br> - For instance?<br> When you look at yourself<br> do you like what you see?<br> If you like what you see, you're<br> the person you should be.<br> 'Cause your reflection<br> reflects in everything you do,<br> and everything you<br> do reflects on you.<br> When you wake up each day<br> do you like how you feel?<br> If you like how you feel,<br> you've got nothing to conceal.<br> 'Cause your reflection<br> reflects in everything you do,<br> and everything you<br> do reflects on you.<br> Doing something for someone else<br> isn't really for someone else.<br> It does twice as much for you as<br> something you do just for yourself.<br> When you lay down to sleep<br> do you like all your dreams?<br> If you like all your dreams,<br> life's as happy as it seems.<br> 'Cause your reflection<br> reflects in everything you do,<br> and everything you<br> do reflects on you.<br> Now you said the other night that these<br> farms around here need better irrigation.<br> Well you were an engineer,<br> go irrigate them.<br> Yea!<br> Excuse me, I was looking<br> for your brother.<br> He's not here.<br> She seems to be quite<br> taken with him.<br> Let's hope that beautiful young women can<br> talk more sense into him than I can.<br> You spoke of her as young.<br> My dear friend I hate<br> to dissolution you.<br> But you must not be<br> deceived by her appearance.<br> Our way of life has preserved<br> her youth and her beauty.<br> She came here when she was 20.<br> She was on her wedding journey but her<br> carriers lost their way in the mountains<br> and the whole party would have<br> perished but for meeting our people.<br> They brought her here.<br> That was many, many years ago.<br> How many?<br> You are more beautiful than<br> the women of Thailand.<br> More feminine than<br> the women of France.<br> More pliable than<br> the women of Japan.<br> - More<br> - Stop. Stop.<br> I don't want to hear about<br> all these other women.<br> All I want to hear is<br> that, you won't leave me.<br> Oh, I adore you.<br> But, I can't stay here.<br> There's so much I want to do with<br> my life that, I can't do here.<br> Maria, if I could find a way,<br> would you come back with me?<br> - There is no way.<br> - Well there has to be!<br> Tomorrow I'm going out to the pass that<br> leads out of here, to see if its guarded.<br> And to look for those porters.<br> If they exist.<br> They exist.<br> They do?<br> Then why didn't you<br> tell me before?<br> I hoped you would become<br> contented, like the others.<br> Con-Contented?<br> Oh...<br> Look, I have to get out of here.<br> Please, will you come with me?<br> Would you stay with<br> me here if I said no?<br> Then I will come with you.<br> The water starts up in<br> the hills all right<br> but about halfway down it's<br> starts going the wrong way.<br> Now if we put a dam here and these<br> interconnecting bamboo pipes<br> you'd have the whole valley. You'd<br> have the entire mountainside.<br> And just watch that stuff grow. And no<br> more women carrying buckets of water.<br> - Sam you're excited.<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> I guess it's been a long time.<br> - A longtime what?<br> - Oh, since I was so excited.<br> And involved.<br> A long time ago I used<br> to work the land.<br> I guess I got waylaid<br> somewhere along the line.<br> - What happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Come on.<br> - Forget it. I don't wanna talk about it.<br> Sam, I'm interested.<br> Okay, does the name Simon<br> Causefield mean anything to you?<br> Causefield...<br> - Yeah, didn't he<br> - That's me.<br> I remember American<br> Consolidated Products.<br> And the thing fell apart. You<br> were gone and the money was too.<br> I wasn't there because there wasn't<br> any money! And it wasn't my fault!<br> I'd worked hard and<br> made a little bit.<br> That little bit became a lot.<br> So I built a corporation. It<br> became a lot of corporations.<br> I was a hero.<br> It was the American dream.<br> Everybody wanted in.<br> I did ask them to, nobody told<br> them to buy, they just did.<br> Overnight the balloon burst.<br> The next day I'm the biggest crook<br> that the country has ever seen.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> So I started running.<br> Anywhere I think that<br> they won't find me.<br> That's how I ended up in Baskul.<br> Maybe here the running can stop.<br> Maybe.<br> Sam<br> I stopped running<br> here, you can too.<br> Il pleut, il pleut, bergre.<br> Il pleut, il pleut, bergre.<br> Look, uh-uh-uh, I-I don't<br> know a thing about teaching.<br> - C'mon you're going to have to<br> - Mouton.<br> - Il pleut, il pleut, <br> - All you have to do is to follow me.<br> Come along with me.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> Miss Catherine has to<br> leave you, so I want to<br> introduce you to your<br> new teacher of the day.<br> Your new expert Mr. Lovett.<br> Yea.<br> Well now, there you are, here<br> I am, and ah, where are we?<br> Ah, success. You think<br> that was funny folks,<br> 'You ain't heard nothing yet.'<br> - Now what are you learning?<br> - French.<br> French. Well that lets me out.<br> 'I know nothing about French.'.<br> A teacher should only teach what he knows<br> at all I know is ah, Show Business<br> I don't think they'd approve.<br> You know when I was a kid,<br> the thing that got me<br> was that every teacher I ever had, only<br> ask me questions and expected answers.<br> You too? Well I'll<br> tell you what I think.<br> Any dummy can know the answers. It's the<br> smart ones that know the questions.<br> Question me an answer<br> bright and clear.<br> I will answer with a<br> question clear and bright.<br> Even though your<br> answer may be<br> wrong my question<br> will be right.<br> Question me an answer.<br> Answer with a question.<br> Fourteen hundred ninety two.<br> What's the year that Babe Ruth<br> hit his sixtieth home run?<br> Wellington at Waterloo.<br> Who became the hero at<br> the battle of Bull Run?<br> Learning can be lots of fun.<br> Question me an answer<br> bright and clear.<br> I will answer with a<br> question clear and bright.<br> Even though your<br> answer may be<br> wrong my question<br> will be right.<br> Question me an answer.<br> Answer with a question.<br> Midnight ride of Paul Revere.<br> What's the way that Yankee<br> Doodle really went to town?<br> Cleaning up the atmosphere.<br> What's the reason London<br> Bridge is always falling down.<br> You can learn things<br> from a clown.<br> Question me an answer<br> bright and clear.<br> I will answer with a<br> question clear and bright.<br> Even though your<br> answer may be<br> wrong my question<br> will be right.<br> Question me an answer.<br> Answer with a question.<br> On the good ship Lollypop.<br> How did Christopher<br> Columbus sail upon the sea?<br> Underneath the circus top.<br> Where did Cleopatra get<br> to meet Mark Antony?<br> They say knowledge<br> makes you free.<br> They say knowledge<br> makes you free.<br> Question me an answer<br> if you please.<br> I will answer with a<br> question if I can.<br> Let me show you just how I<br> became an educated man.<br> Question me an answer.<br> Answer with a question.<br> If you wanna' know, if you<br> wanna' hear, if you wanna' see,<br> question me an answer.<br> Harry, what are you doing?<br> You hear that? They love me!<br> They love me.<br> It's beautiful.<br> It's also inconceivable.<br> Father Perrault, his story and<br> This place hidden away from<br> the rest of the world.<br> Then you come along and<br> confuse me even more.<br> - Am I so strange?<br> - No you're not.<br> Nothing here is strange.<br> And that's what's so confusing.<br> I'm desperately<br> trying to keep my<br> emotional feedings<br> and my spiritual needs<br> from clobbering each<br> other to death.<br> You're very beautiful.<br> And very desirable.<br> But like everything else beautiful<br> that's happened to me here.<br> I find it remarkable that<br> it has happened to me here<br> and not out there.<br> You know, I can't<br> explain it but, <br> everything seems familiar.<br> This air, <br> Those beautiful gardens, you,<br> This lamasery with its<br> feet rooted in a good earth<br> of this fertile valley.<br> While its head<br> explores the eternal.<br> And I've been kidnapped<br> Brought here against my will<br> which is a crime, a great crime.<br> And yet I accepted it<br> as, one would accept<br> an act performed by<br> a very dear friend.<br> Can you tell me why?<br> Perhaps because you've always been a<br> part of Shangri-La without knowing it.<br> I'm certain there's a, wish for<br> Shangri-La in everyone's heart.<br> I've never seen<br> you're outside world<br> but I imagine it's full<br> of millions of people<br> who secretly wish to be in a<br> beautiful place like this.<br> Well if they were, it wouldn't<br> be beautiful for long.<br> For years I hoped<br> that someone like you<br> would come and share<br> these moments with me.<br> But now you're here you're<br> not as I pictured you.<br> What did you expect?<br> From your books some<br> uh, Saintly Hero.<br> Almost astatic.<br> And much less attractive.<br> Well, people who worship heroes must<br> be prepared for disillusionment.<br> But, I shall become<br> saintly immediately.<br> Just, to please you.<br> Did you ever think<br> What did you expect? Or hope?<br> I imagined she'd<br> be just like you.<br> I come to you<br> with all my hopes and<br> I bring you love.<br> I come to you<br> All my life I searched<br> for something rare.<br> A love that I could share.<br> I come to you with all my<br> dreams and I bring you love.<br> I come to you.<br> There were times my<br> faith in life was gone,<br> still I continued on.<br> Those endless days<br> turned into years.<br> They were lonely<br> years in many ways.<br> And deep inside I'm sure I always<br> knew I had to wait for you.<br> And here you are,<br> my own true love.<br> I come to you.<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday dear Harry<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Thank you. Thank you my friends.<br> Old friends.<br> And new friends.<br> And a special thank you to Sally<br> for arranging the candles.<br> Twenty one how'd you guess?<br> Well, here we go.<br> Yea.<br> Well, this is a pretty<br> happy day for me.<br> Not just because it's<br> my birthday but ah,<br> because I've come<br> to a big decision.<br> I've decided to<br> stay in Shangri-La.<br> If they'll have me.<br> Good that's fine.<br> Now wait a minute. Hold it.<br> I hope Mr. Chang<br> that you'll go along with<br> a great idea I've got.<br> I shall be most interested<br> to hear it Mr. Lovett.<br> Well Mr. Chang I know<br> I speak for all of us<br> I say that ah<br> this place is terrific.<br> I don't worry here,<br> and I sleep well.<br> Confidentially I've had some<br> pretty rough times lately.<br> Few bookings and audiences well<br> They weren't throwing bread,<br> they sat on their hands.<br> But ah, these kids here<br> They ah...<br> They love me.<br> You know I took a little personal<br> inventory about 10:30 last night,<br> just before going to sleep.<br> And I said to myself.<br> "Harry Lovette things are going<br> pretty well for a change."<br> And they are, so why not go for a<br> run of the play contract. Right?<br> Well down in school those kids,<br> Terrific kids you<br> got here Mr. Chang.<br> They're very imaginative.<br> They keep imitating me.<br> Wanting to be like me.<br> I thought it might be a good idea<br> to give them a course in dramatics.<br> Teach them to sing<br> and dance, you know<br> sort of that, 'Big Time Stuff.'<br> But ah, would that be all<br> right with you Mr. Chang?<br> Can I stay?<br> Watch it Mr. Chang he's liable<br> to cause chaos in that school.<br> I don't think so.<br> We have a saying,<br> "The trees that bend a little<br> to the harmless breeze,<br> will later grow to<br> withstand the wild wind."<br> Uh?<br> We shall be most honored<br> to have you Mr. Lovett.<br> Oh, great great great.<br> Now, I'll cut the cake.<br> Chang!<br> I wanna' talk with<br> you Mr. Chang.<br> That famous tribe of porter's<br> expected for two years<br> that will take us all out of<br> here whenever they arrive.<br> Well, I've just discovered they<br> have arrived, three days ago.<br> And there was never any intention<br> that they should take us out of here.<br> Isn't that right Mr. Chang?<br> I'm going with them Richard.<br> As for the rest of you<br> well, think about it.<br> Mr. Conway.<br> My friend you must<br> not let him go.<br> The porters could only take<br> him a certain distance.<br> Beyond that is a wilderness for<br> which he would never get out alive.<br> You should have told me<br> the porters where here.<br> I could have prepared<br> him for this.<br> Talk to him.<br> I'll try, I don't think<br> he'll listen to me.<br> Richard.<br> Richard.<br> Be careful. He will want<br> you to go with him.<br> Well.<br> What shall I do Catherine?<br> Go and talk to Father Perrault.<br> Yes, I will.<br> And I need your help Father,<br> to stop him from leaving.<br> I am no longer able to help you.<br> The responsibility is yours.<br> My son<br> I'm going to die.<br> I wish to place in your hands,<br> the future and destiny<br> of Shangri-La.<br> I knew my work was done when<br> I first set eyes upon you.<br> I'd been waiting for<br> you for a long time.<br> I've sat in this room<br> and seen the faces<br> of many newcomers.<br> I've looked into their eyes<br> and heard their voices.<br> Always in the hope<br> that I might find you.<br> It's not an honest task<br> that I bequeathed.<br> For our order knows<br> no rigid bonds.<br> To be gentle and patient,<br> to care for the<br> riches of the mind,<br> to reside here in wisdom,<br> while the storm rages without.<br> It will be such a one my son as<br> the world has not seen before.<br> There will be no safety by arms.<br> No help from authority.<br> No answer in science.<br> It will rage till every flower<br> of culture is trampled<br> and all human beings are leveled<br> in a loss chaos.<br> Ask yourself, has it<br> not already begun?<br> Do you, really believe that I'll<br> live to see the end of the storm?<br> I do. That is why it is you<br> who must preserve<br> the fragrance of our history<br> and add to it, a touch<br> of your own mind.<br> You net<br> I<br> My vision weakens.<br> I can see,<br> the great distance.<br> A new world<br> stirring in the ruins.<br> Stirring clumsily<br> but in hopefulness.<br> Seeking its lost and<br> legendary treasures.<br> They will all be here my son.<br> Hidden behind the mountains<br> in the Valley Of The Blue Moon.<br> Preserve in Shangri-La.<br> I see...<br> my...<br> miracle.<br> And that's the story.<br> He said, " I place in your hands the<br> future and destiny of Shangri-La."<br> I now know that<br> I found the answers to<br> all the confusion of the<br> world that has plagued<br> me for a long time.<br> I found what I'm searching for<br> I don't know what to say to you.<br> Do you really believe<br> everything he told you?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Without any proof?<br> The proof is in the man himself.<br> In everything I've felt.<br> Here, from the beginning.<br> Doesn't the story<br> mean anything to you?<br> What could it mean to me?<br> You're right George. This<br> is no place for you.<br> And you should realize it's<br> no place for you either.<br> You're needed in<br> the outside world<br> where the problems are far<br> more urgent and pressing<br> than they are here<br> in Shangri-La.<br> Here, here you<br> just marking time.<br> Besides think of your<br> obligations to the U.N.<br> I know the obligations.<br> I know.<br> But I've found peace here.<br> And I've found love.<br> And I must hold on to it.<br> I'm going to pack and<br> see to the others.<br> Richard, I beg you<br> to think again.<br> And change your mind.<br> George, I'm staying.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm very sorry.<br> I shall miss you. So will<br> a lot of other people.<br> So you won't be lonely, I've<br> talked to the rest of them.<br> They're staying too.<br> So it'll be just Maria and me.<br> Maria, what she got<br> to do with it?<br> She's coming with me.<br> - You can't take her away.<br> - Why not?<br> Don't you know what will happen<br> to her if she leaves Shangri-La?<br> She'll begin to live the happiest part<br> of her life. That's what will happen.<br> She'll begin to live the<br> last moments of her life.<br> Her beauty is<br> She must stay here<br> where she's safe.<br> She's young and strong, she'll<br> manage the trip all right.<br> George listen, she<br> can't make that trip.<br> She's not young and strong. Chang<br> told me that she came here, <br> Eighty?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Oh come on Richard, you<br> can't believe that.<br> You've seen her, she's<br> not a day over 20.<br> Shangri-La will keep her<br> youthful indefinitely.<br> I see. And what if she<br> leaves Shangri-La?<br> Chang said she would quickly<br> revert to her actual age.<br> And you must believe it.<br> Look, will you believe me<br> if I prove you're wrong?<br> And will you then see that,<br> if I'm right about Maria,<br> I'm probably right<br> about the rest too.<br> I'll die if I have to<br> stay here alone now.<br> George promised he<br> wouldn't leave me.<br> If it weren't for me<br> you'd never get out.<br> It was I who bribed the porters.<br> They were forbidden by the High<br> Lama to take any one out of here.<br> - Is it true?<br> - I was with her.<br> They only took the bribe<br> because he's dead now.<br> But aren't you afraid to leave? You<br> know what will happen if you go.<br> Happen?<br> Ah, I suppose Chang<br> told you that I am old.<br> That is part of the<br> myth of Shangri-La.<br> Chang did tell you didn't he.<br> Yes.<br> Look at me Mr. Conway,<br> Do I look like an old woman?<br> Is this the skin<br> of an old woman?<br> Are these the eyes<br> of an old woman?<br> And in my heart, are these the<br> feedings of an old woman?<br> Do you believe I have<br> been here for 80 years?<br> Like us, she was kidnapped.<br> They brought her here<br> just two years ago.<br> Well I don't believe it. I<br> can't believe it. She's lying.<br> You're lying every word you said is a lie.<br> Now come on admit it.<br> What reason would<br> I have for lying?<br> Look Mr. Conway,<br> the chances are, we will never live<br> through this terrible journey.<br> But, I would rather go<br> out there with George,<br> and die in a snowstorm than<br> stay here one minute more.<br> But why have they<br> told me this story!<br> Because they need you here.<br> Sally and the others have already<br> found ways to be useful,<br> But you're the one they were<br> after, you had to be convinced.<br> But your job isn't here and<br> you must realize that now.<br> Are you telling me the truth?<br> I am 20 years old and I was<br> brought here two years ago.<br> I'm going to need your<br> help on this journey.<br> We both are.<br> Please come with us Richard.<br> I believe her.<br> Humph.<br> I once said to Chang that I<br> was afraid this was a dream<br> from which I might suddenly<br> and unhappily awake.<br> All right, I'll come with you.<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine?<br> To Len.<br> - Yes Mr. Conway.<br> - Where's Catherine?<br> Chang has given orders that<br> she cannot be disturbed.<br> But where is she,<br> I must see her.<br> I regret that is not<br> possible Mr. Conway.<br> Richard! Richard come on.<br> I can't find Catherine.<br> I'm sorry, but the<br> porters won't wait.<br> Richard, the porters won't wait.<br> I hope they make it.<br> Doesn't tempt you,<br> does it Harry?<br> Not me Sam.<br> We can still go with<br> them if you want to.<br> What's happened?<br> Where's Richard?<br> He's leaving my child.<br> - Leaving?!<br> - But, he will return.<br> Richard!<br> Richard!<br> Richard.<br> Richard, hurry!<br> Richard!<br> Richard!<br> Richard!<br> Richard.<br> [Hundunn!]<br> Can't you get them to wait.<br> They're leaving us<br> father behind everyday.<br> They're only trying to save themselves.<br> We're too slow.<br> I am sorry. I cannot go faster.<br> I cannot move faster.<br> - Hey! Hey!<br> - Hey! Hey!<br> [Hoodelee]<br> Aahh!<br> Richard.<br> Help me.<br> I must rest. I cannot<br> go on any longer.<br> I must rest!<br> I'll carry her.<br> Richard? Richard!<br> Richard, her-her face!<br> Look at her face!<br> There's a cave over there.<br> Help me.<br> There.<br> Ugh.<br> No!<br> No!<br> - Oh no!<br> - George!<br> No no!<br> - George!<br> - No!<br> Aaaahh!<br> Aah!<br> Doctor.<br> How are you Mr. Conway?<br> I dreamt for a moment<br> that I was back again.<br> Back again? Where?<br> Where?<br> How are you feeling?<br> I don't know whether I've<br> been mad, and now sane or,<br> I was sane for a time<br> and now mad again.<br> Mr. Conway.<br> How do you know my name?<br> The whole world knows your name<br> and wonders what happened to you?<br> You were flying back from a U.N. peace<br> mission when your plane disappeared.<br> Peace mission.<br> - Did we succeeded?<br> - Sadly no.<br> But there's always hope.<br> Yes hope.<br> It must be that.<br> Mr. Ferguson, I'm Dr. Verden.<br> I told Conway you're coming.<br> - Oh good. This is my associate Theo Murphy.<br> - How do you do.<br> - Dr..<br> - Please come with me.<br> Follow me.<br> When the tribesmen found him<br> wandering in the lower valley,<br> he was totally lost.<br> Suffering from snow blindness<br> and near starvation.<br> Despite this, they had a hard<br> time getting him to the village.<br> So keen was he to get<br> back into the mountains.<br> To get to this place<br> called Shangri-La.<br> Shangri-La. Yes, that<br> was in your report.<br> - But do you think...?<br> - You'll hear about it from him.<br> Come.<br> Where he is he?<br> I'm afraid you arrived too late.<br> He's gone.<br> Gone?<br> Shangri-La.<br> On and on he talked about<br> this fantastic place.<br> He must return. He must return!<br> Obviously right now that's<br> what he's trying to do.<br> But I've got to find him.<br> It's my job to take him home.<br> Your job won't be easy Mr. Ferguson,<br> even if you do find him.<br> This, obsession if you will,<br> kept him alive in the wilderness,<br> beyond all human endurance.<br> Even here his convalescence<br> is do less to medicine,<br> than to that, all consuming<br> passion to return.<br> In Richard Conway's mind,<br> Shangri-La represents the<br> ultimate way of life.<br> It's ah, Shangri-La.<br> Do you believe it?<br> Yes, I believe it.<br> I believe it, because<br> I want to believe it.<br> There's a Lost Horizon,<br> waiting to be found.<br> There's a Lost Horizon<br> where the sound of guns<br> doesn't pound in your ears,<br> anymore.<br> S.<br> Su.<br> Sub.<br> Subt.<br> Subti.<br> Subtit.<br> Subtitl.<br> Subtitle.<br> I wish to thank the aforementioned for<br> their help with the sub's and lyrics.<br> Bye.<br>
