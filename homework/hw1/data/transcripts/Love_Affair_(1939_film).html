He's so sweet.<br> I couldn't even get him<br> to come to the table.<br> - I can do that.<br> - Would you?<br> I'll do that for you.<br> That's so nice of you.<br> What are you doing?<br> Watching you move.<br> I saw what was going on<br> with you and the captain.<br> I'm not gonna put up with it<br> another moment, understand me?<br> They may be pretty faces,<br> but they're shallow.<br> Thank you, dear, I just...<br> I needed to hear you say that.<br> Did she fall for it?<br> The silly story of the plane going<br> down and moving to a Russian ship.<br> She doesn't ask a lot of questions.<br> - Is that good?<br> - I think so.<br> You don't play around, do you?<br> No, but I think I might have to if<br> I were involved with someone like you.<br> But you wouldn't.<br> You're way too fussy.<br> - Fussy?<br> - Cautious.<br> Playing around is like this.<br> Too much is bad for you,<br> but a little raises the HDLs.<br> - HDLs?<br> - Good for the heart.<br> Is it?<br> I think that might be<br> difficult for you.<br> Is that so?<br> It might be.<br> But you can get a little wet,<br> even if you're fussy.<br> Miss MclKay.<br> Radiotelegram.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Alka-Seltzer, for headache.<br> My wife has a headache.<br> It's me.<br> It's me.<br> Hello, honey.<br> - She was drunk.<br> - You're drunk.<br> - I'm not drunk!<br> - I see you're drunk.<br> - You're at the bar, flirting.<br> - I do not flirt!<br> You do flirt!<br> You gonna marry him?<br> Forget that.<br> What do you mean, a sailboat?<br> A coat or a dress I can understand.<br> But a sailboat?<br> That's what I'm doing in Sydney.<br> I'm decorating a sailboat.<br> - A red one.<br> - You're a decorator?<br> I'm a musician.<br> What do you play?<br> Piano, I guess.<br> I don't know. I teach it.<br> But I also write songs and I sing.<br> You sure sound like you sing.<br> Yeah, I sing.<br> I'm big. I'm very big.<br> Ray Charles sings, "You got the right<br> one" and someone goes, "Uh-huh"...<br> ...in certain South American<br> countries, that's me.<br> Also, I have dabbled in waitressing...<br> ...but at the apex of my music career<br> and my food service career...<br> ...I met a man and I helped him<br> decorate his apartment in New York.<br> Then I decorated his Hampton house<br> and his house in Palm Beach.<br> Then I decorated his apartment<br> in Sydney.<br> If his acquisition<br> of Virgin succeeds...<br> ...I'm sure I'll decorate something<br> in London.<br> But at the moment, it's a sailboat.<br> It's red. It's nice.<br> - You gonna marry him?<br> - Yeah, I guess. I hope so.<br> I'm madly in love with him.<br> What?<br> Come here.<br> All right?<br> - I really should go.<br> - No, don't.<br> I think so.

Thanks, Dorothy.<br> - Call me if you need anything.<br> - All right, I will. Thanks.<br> I'll be right upstairs.<br> Hello.<br> - Mike?<br> - Hello, Terry.<br> Good to see you.<br> It's good to see you too.<br> You feeling all right?<br> Yeah. I'm just...<br> ...catching up.<br> Good, good.<br> It's been a long time.<br> Yes, it has, hasn't it?<br> It is good to see you.<br> You said that. Could I...?<br> Yes, please do.<br> Thanks.<br> I'll just be a minute.<br> - You don't mind?<br> - Of course not.<br> Good, good.<br> I bet you're wondering how I got here.<br> I was looking through a phone<br> book for a man named McBride...<br> ...and I ran across the name<br> "T. MclKay. "<br> I said to myself:<br> "Could that possibly be Terry MclKay,<br> my old friend?"<br> - It was.<br> - And then I said to myself:<br> "I wasn't very nice to her. I had<br> an appointment with her, and I...<br> ...didn't keep it. "<br> - You didn't?<br> - No.<br> No.<br> So then I said to myself... I talk<br> to myself quite a lot these days.<br> "That's not a nice way<br> to treat a friend.<br> I have to apologize to her. "<br> If one doesn't keep an appointment,<br> shouldn't they apologize?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, you're absolutely right.<br> The least people can do<br> is say they're sorry.<br> So here I am.<br> - That's very sweet.<br> - I thought so.<br> I've often wondered about you.<br> - Have you really?<br> - Yes, really.<br> I've wondered about you, too.<br> You weren't angry?<br> You must have been at first.<br> I was. I was.<br> At first, I was furious.<br> I said, "He can't do this to me.<br> Who does he think he is?"<br> - Did you wait long?<br> - Yes, I waited. I waited until...<br> Midnight?<br> - Then what?<br> - I got really mad.<br> You can just imagine,<br> being up there...<br> In a thunderstorm.<br> - In a thunderstorm?<br> - Yeah.<br> What did you say?<br> Then I said, "Why don't you<br> just go home and get drunk?"<br> - But you didn't.<br> - I didn't?<br> You just took one little drink...<br> ...every hour for about two months.<br> Can you blame me?<br> Not at all. No.<br> The least I could've done<br> was send you a note.<br> Maybe by the time you thought of it,<br> you couldn't find me.<br> But certainly you swore that if you<br> ever saw me again you'd ask.<br> No. We said if we could make it,<br> we'd be there.<br> If one of us didn't show up,<br> there must be a good reason.<br> - Did we say that?<br> - Yes, that's exactly what we said.<br> Like what, for instance?<br> So there'll be no more<br> questions asked, I hope.<br> Thirsty?<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Mike.<br> Isn't this wonderful?<br> I walk over here just to...<br> Now I'm not even supposed to ask<br> why you weren't there.<br> - It doesn't seem fair, does it?<br> - I know.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> When I'm with you, I just...<br> - No wedding ring.<br> - No.<br> I thought when I saw you<br> last night...<br> No.<br> He was just...<br> No.<br> Sorry.<br> So how are you?<br> You can ask questions?<br> I thought everything was fine<br> till I saw you last night.<br> Then I knew there must be something<br> between us, even if only an ocean.<br> So I got a ticket.<br> Where are you going?<br> Away.<br> - When?<br> - Tonight.<br> Unless I can get an earlier flight.<br> Well...<br> You're happy, aren't you?<br> And you?<br> I don't know. Sometimes I...<br> I worry about the future,<br> what people will think of me.<br> That they'll say,<br> "What happened to him? He's a mess. "<br> - "He doesn't really like women. "<br> - Why would they say that?<br> Because every woman<br> he meets, he says:<br> "Where will you be in three months?<br> Meet me in three months. "<br> - And they're there?<br> - Everywhere.<br> Pyramids, Eiffel Tower,<br> Statue of Liberty, everywhere.<br> Just waiting. Waiting.<br> Where is he?<br> Waiting.<br> Want to change the subject?<br> Merry Christmas.<br> I almost forgot.<br> Who would've thought we'd spend<br> Christmas together?<br> - I brought you a present.<br> - I wish I had something for you.<br> I didn't expect anything.<br> It's not really a Christmas present.<br> So that's why my letters came back.<br> Well, I'd have sent it to you,<br> but I...<br> ...didn't know<br> your address till today.<br> She wanted you to have it.<br> Anyway...<br> That's why I...<br> Goodbye, Terry.<br> Goodbye, Mike.<br> You know, I painted you wearing that.<br> I wish you'd seen it. It was good.<br> I left it at the hotel.<br> They hung it in the restaurant...<br> ...and there was a young woman<br> who came in and really liked it.<br> They told me she kept trying<br> to buy it so I said:<br> "Just give it to her because she<br> wants the damn thing so much. "<br> They said she didn't seem like<br> she had a lot of money...<br> ...and not only that,<br> they told me she was...<br> She was...<br> When is your flight?<br> I said, "By all means...<br> ...give it to her because I never took<br> any money for paintings and it was...<br> ...Christmas season, ho-ho-ho.<br> So I...<br> Oh, Mike, don't look at me like that.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> If anything had to happen<br> to one of us...<br> ...why did it have to be you?<br> It was my own fault.<br> I was looking up.<br> I knew you were there.<br> Don't worry, Mike.<br> It doesn't have to be a miracle.<br> If you can paint, I can walk.<br> Anything can happen, don't you think?<br> Come here.<br>
