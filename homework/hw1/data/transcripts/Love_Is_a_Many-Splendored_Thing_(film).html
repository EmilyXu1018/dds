                        (siren)<br> Dr Han?<br> Dr Keith would like you to come to<br> the emergency ward as soon as you can.<br> (groaning)<br> - What's the trouble, John?<br> - This child was hit by a car and is in shock.<br> - Who is she?<br> - A refugee from China.<br> One of the 3,000 new ones.<br> They pour in every day.<br> - Has she a family?<br> - I don't know.<br> - She was alone at the time of the accident.<br> - Will you take over?<br> I've given her pantopon.<br> She may be injured internally.<br> Boy, move her to x-ray immediately.<br> You had better come along<br> with me, Officer, for the report.<br> Dr Han? I am Mei Loo. You remember?<br> Oh, Mei Loo, I hardly knew you.<br> Is this the little boy who was so ill?<br> But now it is my husband.<br> Make him well, Dr Han.<br> We have no money, but... we will sell the boy.<br> Our little one is intelligent and well-made.<br> We come from a good family.<br> We will do what we can, Mei Loo.<br> But don't you ever try to sell your little boy.<br> - You couldn't anyhow.<br> - I'll take care of him.<br> Anyway, Dr Sen's on his way down.<br> - I wish I were ten people.<br> - You need diversion.<br> - I wish I were ten people.<br> - You need diversion.<br> I'm going to a cocktail party this afternoon.<br> Why don't you come with me?<br> Dr Sen will take over here.<br> Why don't I? A sense of balance<br> might restore my sense of humour.<br> Why anyone would want to live anywhere<br> but Hong Kong I can't understand.<br> Where else could you get<br> ten servants for the price of one?<br> By next month, the ratio will be 12:1.<br> Shanghai's fallen, you know.<br> - The Reds will have all of China soon.<br> - We must all keep our heads here.<br> I hope you'll write something dreadful for<br> your paper about those ungrateful Chi...<br> Oh! John Keith.<br> Now my party is a success.<br> Adeline, this is Han Suyin,<br> my friend and colleague.<br> Han Suyin, I feel I've known you<br> a long, long time.<br> - You're a great artist, I understand.<br> - I'm a doctor.<br> Oh, well, doctors are artists in their way.<br> I knew I'd heard something wonderful about<br> you. John, you know everybody, don't you?<br> - Suyin, I hardly expected to find you here.<br> - Doctor's orders.<br> Adeline's husband is a hospital director.<br> You must let me speak to him, Dr Han.<br> There might be a place for you on the staff.<br> - Thank you, but I am already on the staff.<br> - Oh, how nice.<br> Well, then, we won't have to tell him, will we?<br> I want you to meet Father Lowe.<br> He just escaped from China, too.<br> But I havent just escaped from China.<br> I've been studying medicine in England.<br> I haven't been back to China for ten years.<br> - But you are Chinese.<br> - Eurasian.<br> My father was Chinese.<br> My mother was English.<br> I think of myself as Chinese, however.<br> I know exactly how you feel. The minute<br> I put on a Chinese frock, I feel Chinese.<br> If you have capital invested, you can double<br> your money in Hong Kong in three months...<br> If you have capital invested, you can double<br> your money in Hong Kong in three months...<br> Money, money, money. It's so sordid, dear.<br> I want you to meet Dr Han.<br> This mercenary man is my husband.<br> - Delighted, Doctor.<br> - And this is Father Lowe.<br> - And Mr Beager, Mr Wong and Mr...<br> - Bohannen, dear.<br> Oh, yes. And Mrs Wong, Madame Monet,<br> Mr Daney and Fiona Manton.<br> Father Lowe is fresh out of North China.<br> All the really nice people are getting out.<br> - I was thrown out.<br> - Rice converts, that's what they were.<br> - Rice converts.<br> - I loved them.<br> I knew them as I knew the back of my hand.<br> But they turned me out.<br> I'm sure I'll find China<br> much changed when I return.<br> - You're going back, Doctor?<br> - Don't tell us you're a Communist!<br> No, but I became a doctor to help my people.<br> Like all Chinese,<br> I'm spellbound by my own country.<br> - You'll be shot.<br> - I hope not!<br> - I'm not a politician or a missionary.<br> - Really, I must say...<br> You must say something<br> to your other guests.<br> - We know. I'll pilot Suyin around.<br> - Oh, thank you, John, thank you.<br> - Oh, dear, I'm saying all the wrong things.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Getting your sense of balance back?<br> - Yeah. And my sense of humour.<br> I'd heard that these parties were...<br> - Oh. I left my fan.<br> - Where?<br> Well... I think I put it down<br> when I was handed a cocktail.<br> I'll get it for you. Wait here.<br> - Dr Han? Is this yours?<br> - Thank you.<br> - And these.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm Mark Elliott.<br> - Kind of a dull party, isn't it?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Well, I'm a guest, Mr Elliott.<br> - I'm a guest, too.<br> That gives me the right to call it dull.<br> I was supposed to meet you two weeks ago.<br> - Were you?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Fred Dixon wrote me,<br> asked me to look you up.<br> I didn't as I thought you'd be<br> an intellectual, with glasses.<br> Oh. And where is Mr Dixon now?<br> Oh, he's still in Malaya.<br> Would you have dinner with me tonight?<br> I'm a very pleasant man.<br> Oh, I'm sure of that, but... I'm on duty.<br> When are you not on duty?<br> If we were in Chungking, Mr Elliott,<br> Third Uncle would consider it<br> unpardonable to accept.<br> No Chinese girl would dare dine alone<br> with an American she had just met.<br> - But we're not in Chungking.<br> - I am still Chinese.<br> And half European. I just heard you say so.<br> Now, will your European side reconsider?<br> - Why don't you call me at the hospital?<br> - I'll do that.<br> - Oh, I see you found it.<br> - Oh, this is Mr Elliott. Dr John Keith.<br> - We've met before. Nice to see you again.<br> - Yes. Nice to see you.<br> I really can't believe<br> that you're a doctor, Doctor.<br> What a shame we haven't a scalpel with us.<br> I could make a slight incision<br> to convince you.<br> Tell me about Mark Elliott.<br> Don't know much. He's a newspaperman.<br> Been around a couple of months.<br> A reporter. Why?<br> He's invited me to dinner.<br> - Accepting?<br> - I haven't decided.<br> - He's married, Suyin.<br> - So are you, John, and I go out with you.<br> I happen to be in love with my wife. He isn't.<br> And how do you know so much?<br> Hong Kong is a small place.<br> Well, I dislike being a small person.<br> I'm not remotely interested in Mr Elliott.<br> I doubt if he'll call anyhow.<br> (phone rings)<br> - Dr Han here.<br> - Are you on duty Wednesday?<br> I have Wednesday afternoons off.<br> Good. It's the night of the Moon Festival.<br> Will you have dinner with me?<br> - Where can I pick you up?<br> - Well...<br> I'll meet you at the staff entrance<br> of the hospital at six.<br> - You're wearing European clothes.<br> - My European side is going out with you.<br> - I don't suppose you'd change?<br> - I certainly would not.<br> - I love the dress you had on the other day.<br> - I'll make you a present of it.<br> - So you're a reporter?<br> - Please, a correspondent.<br> - What's the difference?<br> - About a hundred dollars a week.<br> (chattering in Cantonese)<br> The sky is clear.<br> It is a good omen for the Moon Festival.<br> I arranged a full moon for you.<br> I arranged a full moon for you.<br> - Have you ever been in Peking?<br> - Many times.<br> Do you know that in Peking, the moon<br> is larger than anyplace else in the world?<br> Now, that's very unscientific.<br> It's the same size everywhere.<br> Oh, no. The moon is larger in Peking.<br> Much larger than in Hong Kong and London.<br> All right, if you insist.<br> When were you in Peking last?<br> I was studying at<br> the University of Peking in 1939.<br> I'd left by then. I was in England in 1939.<br> Where were you in 1940?<br> - Italy.<br> - I was in Malaya.<br> It seems that destiny never put us<br> anywhere together at the same time.<br> Perhaps destiny intends<br> something for us at last.<br> Oh, I don't think so.<br> I don't think destiny intends anything for us.<br> Of that I'm quite sure.<br> (firecrackers exploding)<br> (shouting)<br> - What's all the noise about?<br> - A cloud has threatened the moon.<br> We must make a great noise<br> to frighten it away,<br> or the year will be unfavourable.<br> - You don't really believe that, do you?<br> - Of course.<br> If we didn't believe the unbelievable,<br> what would happen to faith?<br> (firecrackers continue)<br> You see, the cloud was frightened away.<br> It is a good omen.<br> I wonder if there are men on the moon<br> who celebrate an Earth Festival<br> and shout to keep the clouds away from us.<br> I should like to think so.<br> That's Maxwell Luderman<br> over there, the industrialist.<br> He's just back from Beiping.<br> I've been trying to get to him for a statement.<br> Is he really the third-richest<br> man in the world?<br> First.<br> If you want an interview,<br> why not ask him now?<br> Oh, I don't think he likes correspondents.<br> And anyway, I'd like to finish up<br> our own little interview.<br> Am I being interviewed?<br> I want to know why you're so sure<br> that destiny has nothing in store for us.<br> Well, I'm interested only<br> in one thing: Medicine...<br> and because I know myself.<br> You sound secure. I doubt<br> whether anyone is that secure.<br> I have known but one man in my life.<br> My husband. He was a nationalist general.<br> Captured and shot by the Communists.<br> I believe in the human heart now<br> only as a doctor.<br> I bet you're a good doctor.<br> But I still think that destiny might have<br> something in store for us after all.<br> - Why?<br> - Because you've retreated to a tower,<br> and the only trouble with an ivory tower<br> is it's a temptation to lightning.<br> Lightning will not strike me, Mr Elliott.<br> Your honourable fish, sir.<br> Thank you for the moon<br> and the honourable fish<br> and the lovely evening.<br> You're entirely welcome.<br> I don't know when I've<br> enjoyed an evening as much.<br> I don't know when I've<br> enjoyed an evening as much.<br> - Good night.<br> - I want to tell you something. I'm married.<br> - I knew you were married.<br> - And you still went out with me?<br> If you were happily married<br> there could be no danger,<br> and if you weren't,<br> it could make no difference.<br> Will I see you again?<br> Uh... I think not.<br> I think so. I'll call you about next Wednesday.<br> - Good night, Suyin.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good morning, Dr Sen.<br> - Good morning, Dr Han.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> You combine artistry with medicine, Dr Han.<br> Oh, no. Just with love and sympathy.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> It's a great privilege to watch you.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> Ten days ago we didn't think she would live.<br> Look at her now. She will be walking soon.<br> Have her parents or family been located?<br> No, but the police are still searching.<br> However, with a million refugees<br> from China in Hong Kong now,<br> and more arriving each day, it is like<br> looking for a needle in a haystack.<br> And more arriving each day, it is like<br> looking for a needle in a haystack.<br> Why do they leave China?<br> What can they expect to find here?<br> - A home.<br> - Their home is China.<br> We'll mend her bones, make her well enough<br> to send back into the streets to starve.<br> Oh, no. Not Oh-No.<br> Someone will give her a home.<br> Dr Han, Mr Palmer-Jones<br> would like to speak with you.<br> Thank you.<br> Who will in Hong Kong give her a home?<br> - Or any of the others like her?<br> - Oh, you can't tell.<br> I might adopt her myself.<br> - Good morning, Mr Palmer-Jones.<br> - Dr Han.<br> My wife says that nobody has<br> been near her this morning.<br> I'm sorry. I suppose we are late. The wards<br> are so crowded, we haven't caught up yet.<br> - Do you visit the wards first?<br> - As a rule.<br> I see. Well, would you, as a rule,<br> be so kind as to look in on my wife first?<br> Patience is not one of her virtues.<br> - I'll go in and see her now.<br> - Thank you.<br> (sighs)<br> Good morning, Mrs Palmer-Jones.<br> Oh! Oh, I certainly am glad<br> to see you, Dr Han.<br> The person who brought my breakfast<br> didn't speak one word of English.<br> Was it a nice breakfast?<br> The only thing that was hot<br> was the orange juice.<br> I'll have your tray removed.<br> - Ah, the arm looks better.<br> - Doesn't feel better.<br> There's hardly any swelling left.<br> Imagine being bitten by<br> a centipede in this day and age.<br> Imagine being bitten by<br> a centipede in this day and age.<br> - It's so undignified.<br> - And painful.<br> I can give you one cheerful bit of news.<br> - Oh?<br> - You may go home tomorrow.<br> Oh, no, no, I can't. I can't possibly.<br> My living room is being painted<br> and it won't be dry for a week.<br> - We'll make arrangements.<br> - Thank you. You're a dear.<br> I must do something for you.<br> What would you like?<br> - A bigger hospital.<br> - Huh?<br> You mustn't bite people, Rosie Wu.<br> I had to give the man an injection.<br> It was quite painful.<br> Come on.<br> Suyin, are you going to town this afternoon?<br> No, it's my Wednesday off.<br> I think I'm going to dinner. Why?<br> I was going to ask you to buy me<br> some snails for my new goldfish.<br> (man) Dr Han, telephone.<br> - Won't the pet shop send them?<br> - It hardly seems worth it for two snails.<br> - Dr Han here.<br> - Suyin, Mark.<br> I said I'd call about Wednesday.<br> I hoped we could dine together tonight,<br> but I have to fly to Singapore<br> on an assignment.<br> I'd postpone it, but the airline<br> schedule doesn't work out.<br> Oh, yes, I understand.<br> - If I'm back next week, can we dine then?<br> - Well, we'll see.<br> When I called you earlier,<br> they said you were doing a hysterectomy.<br> - What's a hysterectomy?<br> - Nothing that would interest you.<br> - You don't mind my calling when I'm back?<br> - No. No, I don't mind at all.<br> Do call when you get back.<br> Will two snails be enough, John?<br> Hmm? Oh, yes, yes, ample.<br> Suyin.<br> Suyin! Are you not Suyin?<br> Oh, I know you.<br> You're Suzanne.<br> We went to convent together.<br> - Yes.<br> - How nice!<br> I was sure it was you. Come sit with me.<br> Another cup, please.<br> You recognise me after all this time?<br> Well, you've dyed your hair, but I know you.<br> That proves you remember me.<br> Now tell me about yourself.<br> It's been so long,<br> yet it all comes swiftly back.<br> I remember the morning you kicked<br> the mother superior in the shins.<br> I did not kick Mother Superior.<br> It was Sister Angela.<br> And she limped into chapel<br> to pray for your soul.<br> And I'm afraid she did not pray hard enough.<br> What has happened to you<br> since convent days?<br> I went to a Chinese university for a while.<br> I toured Europe. I married.<br> My husband was killed.<br> I finished medicine in England.<br> I'm now a resident doctor<br> here at the Victoria Hospital.<br> You never married again?<br> No, as a Chinese widow,<br> I have become completely unfeeling.<br> I'm afraid my heart is safely dead.<br> Well, I have to be in love to go on living.<br> Now it's an important Englishman.<br> I pass for English now.<br> I hope you won't give me away.<br> Oh, Suzanne, you should<br> be proud to be Eurasian.<br> And proud of your Chinese heritage.<br> Nonsense. You can't be two things at once.<br> And I advise you, pass for English<br> if you decide to go away.<br> Well, I'm considering going back to China.<br> It would be rather foolish to<br> pass for English, don't you think?<br> Well...<br> - Oh, I must fly away home.<br> - Oh, must you?<br> Yes. My new love wants me to be<br> in my flat when he drops by for tea.<br> We only have half an hour together<br> before he has to have tea with his wife.<br> It's ruining his digestion.<br> We must see each other soon.<br> - Call me at the hospital.<br> - I shall.<br> Give the waiter please the change.<br> I always see people as fish.<br> Separated from the rest of the world,<br> they become unfit to dwell together.<br> These, the fighting fish.<br> These, the peaceful.<br> These have sought safety in darkness.<br> They've lost their vision<br> and the light terrifies them.<br> What species am I, John?<br> You're the peaceful. I shouldn't<br> like to see you become like these,<br> swimming into deep water,<br> losing your vision.<br> Now, what do you mean by that?<br> I hear Mark Elliott's gone to Singapore.<br> Yes, his paper sent him on an assignment.<br> Very convenient for him.<br> Did you know that<br> his wife lives in Singapore?<br> There seems to be a conspiracy<br> to arouse my interest in Mark Elliott.<br> Be careful, lest you succeed.<br> They told me if I'd wait here<br> that you'd be out sooner or later.<br> - When did you get back?<br> - This morning.<br> Would you like to go swimming<br> this afternoon?<br> It's your afternoon off, so work is no excuse.<br> I'd sort of made plans to visit<br> friends of mine across the bay.<br> Well, it's a lovely day. Couldn't you do both?<br> Mark Elliott! What in the world<br> are you doing here?<br> Oh, I show up in strange places.<br> You promised to keep me<br> another week, Dr Han.<br> - I kept you as long as I could.<br> - I forgive you.<br> I hear you were in Singapore. Your wife<br> must've been delighted to see you.<br> Why don't you come up<br> for tea this afternoon?<br> Did you know that I was<br> bitten by a centipede?<br> Yes to the first question, no to the second,<br> can't to the third and no to the last.<br> Well, I was. If a handsome man like you<br> bit me, I wouldn't have minded a bit,<br> but a centipede...<br> - Do I expect you?<br> - Sorry, I'm working this afternoon.<br> Oh. Well, you'll hear from me.<br> Goodbye, Dr Han.<br> Are we going swimming?<br> Mark, going out with you once<br> was harmless enough.<br> I don't want my seeing you to be awkward.<br> Hong Kong has a peculiar code,<br> and malice is a pleasant pastime<br> for women with nothing to do.<br> Oh. Would it make any difference<br> if I told you that I didn't see my wife<br> when I was in Singapore?<br> Six years ago, she said she<br> never wanted to see me again.<br> She hasn't changed her mind,<br> and neither have I.<br> Now, will you go swimming with me?<br> - Well, I... I don't know.<br> - Take your time.<br> You're obviously a woman who's extremely<br> careful about making up her mind.<br> - (Mark) How's this?<br> - Oh, beautiful.<br> - (Mark) How's this?<br> - Oh, beautiful.<br> I'll change.<br> I, um...<br> I'd like to explain about my wife.<br> - You did.<br> - No.<br> I want you to know that<br> I tried to make a go of it.<br> I'd like you to believe that.<br> A great many mistakes are made<br> in the name of loneliness.<br> There's no need to discuss it, Mark.<br> All right, I won't bring it up again.<br> You're brown. You've been in the sun.<br> Yes, I've been playing a lot of tennis.<br> What am I going to do<br> if you go back to China?<br> Play more tennis.<br> You're not really going back<br> to Chungking, are you?<br> It wouldn't be good for you<br> to see too much of me anyhow.<br> Might even be harmful.<br> - Oh? Why?<br> - I'm Eurasian.<br> The word itself seems to suggest a certain<br> moral laxity in the minds of some people.<br> People never think of what words mean.<br> They feel them.<br> - You're talking about stupid people.<br> - Make no mistake, I'm proud to be Eurasian.<br> I like to think we combine<br> the best qualities of both races,<br> that we are the answer to race snobbery.<br> Well, you're certainly the answer<br> to a lot of things for me.<br> Mark, like everyone else in Hong Kong,<br> you're at loose ends.<br> I think you probably need a love affair,<br> but I'm not the answer.<br> I will make no mistakes<br> in the name of loneliness.<br> I have my work and an uncomplicated life.<br> I don't want to feel anything again, ever.<br> A moment ago you said<br> that words had no meanings.<br> That people have to feel.<br> Let's not tax the day with self-analysis.<br> The friends I was going to see<br> have a house across the bay.<br> - Shall we swim over and drop in on them?<br> - Why not?<br> - You tired?<br> - No.<br> I just want to drift<br> and feel the sun on my face.<br> You know, the last few weeks<br> I've come alive.<br> I like it.<br> You've been good for me, Mark.<br> I don't feel that the whole world<br> is sick any longer.<br> I'm glad.<br> Well, look!<br> (laughing) Oh!<br> Why do you look so surprised?<br> You expected me, didn't you?<br> Yes, but I didn't expect you<br> to come out of the ocean.<br> - Nora, this is Mark Elliott.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Robert and Ann.<br> - We've met before. I'll get some towels.<br> - Hi, Ann.<br> - Hi, Mark.<br> Suyin, I never thought of you<br> as Venus rising from the sea.<br> Suyin didn't have anything to wear<br> so I suggested we swim over.<br> Suyin didn't have anything to wear<br> so I suggested we swim over.<br> - I'll get you some dry things.<br> - And something wet in a glass for you.<br> - Run along. Use my room.<br> - Thanks.<br> Well, you're a sly one.<br> When did Mark Elliott discover medicine?<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> - "I don't know what you mean." Oh, really?<br> Can't two intelligent people enjoy each<br> other's company and let it rest there?<br> Not if you're Mark Elliott and Han Suyin.<br> (Nora) Do you like him?<br> I didn't swim across the bay to escape him.<br> (Ann) I knew it. If ever I saw anyone looking<br> moonstruck in the sunshine, it's you.<br> Oh, nonsense. Truth is,<br> I have no intention of falling in love.<br> - Listen to her.<br> - (laughs)<br> He is a nice human being.<br> We are friends. I'm going to keep it that way.<br> With everything that's going on,<br> you think Hong Kong's safe?<br> - Well, is anyplace safe?<br> - Have you men been talking about us?<br> - No, China.<br> - Oh. Let's forget China.<br> Have some music.<br> (traditional Chinese)<br> You see, you can't escape. We forget<br> that China lies just across the hill.<br> ("Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing"<br> instrumental)<br> I think that the relationship between<br> the East and the West should be closer.<br> Don't you, Doctor?<br> You taste of salt.<br> Mark...<br> There is an old Chinese proverb:<br> "Do not wake a sleeping tiger."<br> Certainly not in a small boat.<br> - I'm not being facetious.<br> - Nor am I.<br> I think I'm in love with you.<br> Mark, you don't know about me.<br> You kiss a girl and it doesn't<br> mean anything to you.<br> Just a kiss.<br> But it isn't so with me. I...<br> I feel...<br> - Not that I don't like you, for I do.<br> - I wouldn't do anything to upset you.<br> I have never known<br> any man but my husband.<br> I feel on the brink of something.<br> I don't want to feel this way. It frightens me.<br> You don't want to catch cold.<br> Suyin?<br> Suyin?<br> Sorry. I was in the midst of an argument.<br> An argument?<br> My Chinese side was debating<br> with my European side.<br> What about?<br> Sleeping tigers.<br> Mark...<br> Could I have a cigarette?<br> I've never seen you smoke.<br> I rarely do.<br> You still think we have no destiny together?<br> I have decided one thing:<br> That you must decide,<br> for you are stronger than I am.<br> No, I think you're the strong one.<br> Then you are wrong. For you are gentle,<br> and there is nothing stronger<br> in the world than gentleness.<br> You know what is going to happen<br> if we go on seeing each other.<br> I know we're going to<br> go on seeing each other.<br> You'd better not take me on, you know.<br> You'd better get away from me while you can.<br> There's still time.<br> (Suyin) One starts these things<br> pretending it doesn't matter.<br> Stop worrying, darling.<br> Where can we meet tomorrow?<br> There's a tree at the top of<br> the hill behind the hospital<br> and a path leading up from the road.<br> - I will meet you there at five.<br> - I'll be waiting.<br> (phone rings)<br> Dr Han here.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> I'm late. When I didn't see you,<br> I was afraid you had gone.<br> You're early. We're both early.<br> Give me your hand.<br> (Suyin) Time passes so quickly.<br> I didn't want to be late.<br> (Mark) I wasn't thinking about time.<br> How good it is to know a man<br> who doesn't live his life<br> measuring time in bits and pieces.<br> I like it so much.<br> Hong Kong. The hoard of a jewel thief.<br> What incredible hands you have.<br> They curve like a Balinese dancer's.<br> I have always been afraid of hands.<br> Men's hands. I am not afraid of yours.<br> - Please do not move. Stay very still.<br> - Why?<br> A butterfly has perched on your shoulder.<br> It's a sign of good luck.<br> Oh, you shouldn't have turned!<br> It was a good omen.<br> Why, you're superstitious. And you a doctor!<br> But I was born to superstition.<br> In China, when a peasant has a son,<br> he dresses him in girl's clothes<br> and gives him a girl's name<br> because he's afraid that<br> the jealous gods may take him away.<br> Or if the crop in the field is bountiful,<br> he stands in the ditch and<br> shakes his head and cries aloud<br> "Bad rice, bad rice!"<br> He does this to propitiate the gods,<br> to deceive them.<br> And so it is with me.<br> I should like to deceive the gods.<br> For if they notice me, they may be jealous.<br> We mustn't let the angry gods notice us.<br> - Bad rice, bad rice!<br> - Be quiet!<br> I am very serious.<br> So am I.<br> Dr Sen, this gentleman is looking for Dr Han.<br> - Dr Han is on duty.<br> - Yes, I know,<br> but she left urgent word<br> at the office for me to call her.<br> - Urgent?<br> - Yes, so I came over. I'm Mark Elliott.<br> - I'm Dr Sen. Will you come with me?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Dr Han, Mr Elliott to see you.<br> - Thank you, Doctor.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I got your message at the office.<br> I called. They said you were in surgery,<br> so rather than wait, I came on over.<br> I didn't mean that urgent.<br> It's all right. Thank you.<br> - What's happened?<br> - We can't talk here. I'm just going off duty.<br> - Would you like to see how I live?<br> - Sure.<br> Magnificent, isn't it?<br> The warm-water pipes run under my floor.<br> The cockroaches grow enormous<br> and fight great duels.<br> They thrive on DDT, so I leave them alone.<br> Now I can visualise your surroundings<br> when I'm not with you.<br> You look sleepy. You've got marks<br> of weariness under your eyes.<br> I do a lot of writing at night<br> so I can spend...<br> more time with you.<br> Shall I make you some coffee?<br> Now, what upsets you? Why did you call me?<br> - I'm going to Chungking in the morning.<br> - Why?<br> I received an urgent cable from my uncle.<br> He is the head of my family<br> since my mother and father died.<br> Something has happened at home.<br> Something about Suchen.<br> - Who is Suchen?<br> - A younger sister.<br> I haven't seen her since... for several years.<br> Can't you handle this<br> without going to Chungking?<br> Mark, it isn't only Suchen.<br> I want to see China again.<br> To see if it is what I really want to go back to.<br> And also I... I think I must<br> get away from you for a while.<br> Get away from me? Now, why?<br> To adjust to certain truths<br> and not let them bother me.<br> That's foolish nonsense. Unless<br> you've changed your mind about me.<br> No. But I can't help asking myself<br> what I will get out of this<br> except to become<br> a cheap Hong Kong Eurasian.<br> That can never be true<br> and I don't want you to say it.<br> Well, I will say it.<br> Then I've been wrong about you.<br> I don't understand your thinking.<br> How could you? You're not Eurasian.<br> Your pride and sense of dignity<br> are not involved.<br> Of course they are! You're not<br> something I picked up off the street.<br> - You're oversensitive about being Eurasian.<br> - I am trying to be sensible.<br> You are an American.<br> In my heart I am Chinese.<br> You are married. I am a widow.<br> You are a journalist,<br> a front-row spectator not directly involved.<br> I am a doctor deeply involved,<br> with a duty toward my people.<br> - I don't want anything sordid to...<br> - Sordid?! I'm in love with you.<br> Don't you understand, Suyin? I love you.<br> Oh, Mark. We both know that even<br> the fat, ugly people of this world<br> believe that being in love makes<br> them beautiful and justifies everything.<br> I want something better than that for us.<br> While I stand around biting my fingers<br> until you decide I'm worth the risk.<br> Oh, Mark. Don't let<br> your male vanity enter this.<br> You don't have to go to Chungking<br> to rid your conscience of me.<br> - I'll get out now.<br> - Don't threaten me, Mark.<br> That's not a threat.<br> (speaks Cantonese)<br> - Is this seat occupied?<br> - Suyin, sit down.<br> Suzanne, are you going to Chungking?<br> - No, we're going to Kwajalein.<br> - We?<br> (in low voice) I'm not alone.<br> We thought it would be better<br> if we sat separately.<br> He's one of the directors of the hospital.<br> I'll get your salary raised.<br> Should we seem so friendly?<br> - He might suspect you're not English.<br> - Oh, he found out.<br> Thought I was doing it for his sake,<br> so he bought me this.<br> - Isn't that lovely?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> These are real diamonds.<br> La-loo.<br> - Third Uncle.<br> - Suyin.<br> Third Aunt.<br> - Cousin Lee Foo.<br> - May Yin, Cousin Suyin.<br> - Cousin Lee Chung.<br> - Shaw Fong, Cousin Suyin.<br> Cousin Lee Wong?<br> Yen Feng, Cousin Suyin.<br> We have waited for this moment.<br> We hope that you have<br> not changed within you.<br> I am the same,<br> and you are as I remembered you.<br> - Your face is fuller.<br> - It was not yesterday.<br> Some of the family thought<br> that you would be foreign to us.<br> You do not seem strange.<br> I feel like the locust that<br> has suddenly cast its shell.<br> You are at home. We shall now<br> have tea and speak of absurdities.<br> May we now speak of Suchen, Third Uncle?<br> Suchen has brought disgrace on us.<br> She has gone to live in<br> the house of a foreigner.<br> Not 50 yards from our home, she is<br> living under the protection of this alien.<br> Why?<br> She fears that when the Communists<br> take over Chungking that she will be shot.<br> She thinks they won't harm her<br> in the house of a foreigner.<br> Our clan has never begged of foreigners.<br> May I see her, Third Uncle?<br> It has grown dark.<br> I will send a boy to light the way for you.<br> (Suchen speaks Cantonese)<br> It is I - Suyin, elder sister.<br> I didn't think you'd come.<br> Of course I'd come.<br> Now tell me...<br> What is this disgrace<br> you've brought on our family?<br> You accuse me? You have<br> become a foreigner yourself.<br> You are free. You can return to Hong Kong.<br> Third Uncle will not secure a passport for me,<br> so I must stay and be shot<br> when the Communists come.<br> And would you stand under<br> the protection of the foreigner<br> and watch if your family was shot?<br> They could flee. But they will not.<br> I am sick of Chungking.<br> I want to be as free as you to<br> live my life... and forget China.<br> If I get you a passport,<br> will you return to the family and<br> wipe out this obligation to the foreigner?<br> I want only to get away.<br> You will have your passport.<br> Yes?<br> (man speaks Mandarin)<br> (speaks Mandarin)<br> I couldn't risk letting you get away<br> from me, so I came after you.<br> Is there someplace where<br> we can go and talk for a moment?<br> Third Uncle, we would like to go<br> into the courtyard and talk privately.<br> Will you graciously grant permission?<br> The night is cool.<br> I shall have tea waiting to warm you.<br> Suyin, will you marry me?<br> But you are not free...<br> I'll get my freedom as soon as we return.<br> I don't want to make you do<br> anything that will hurt others.<br> You won't like that.<br> And you won't like me.<br> I want to know if you'll marry me.<br> I will always do what you want me to do.<br> Then it's settled.<br> It is settled.<br> Yet I should like permission of my uncle.<br> It would hurt him not to make this gesture.<br> Sit here, Suyin. There, Mr Elliott.<br> Third Uncle...<br> I respectfully ask your permission<br> to become the wife of Mark Elliott.<br> - Where would you live?<br> - In Hong Kong, with Mark.<br> And will you now give up your vow<br> to medicine for devotion to Mr Elliott?<br> I won't ask Suyin to give up<br> being a doctor to be my wife, sir.<br> Suyin... you are a Chinese citizen.<br> When your passport expires,<br> you may not be granted<br> the right to practise in Hong Kong.<br> Where would you go?<br> If Suyin wanted to practise medicine<br> in China, I would live here.<br> The new tapestry will be<br> tightly woven, Mr Elliott.<br> You would not fit into its hard pattern.<br> We can always go to America.<br> Ah, yes.<br> It can begin in flight,<br> pull up roots, and wither and die.<br> Third Aunt, do you believe<br> that this is wrong?<br> You have asked, and I must answer.<br> He is a foreigner.<br> Well, that I can't change.<br> We are not strange to this problem, Mr Elliott.<br> Suyin's father left the land of<br> his ancestors for a European.<br> He left part of his heart.<br> I would rather face the future without<br> hope than the present without Mark.<br> Then you must do what you have to do.<br> We cannot stem the tide of change.<br> Leave nothing behind with us, Suyin.<br> Enter this marriage wholeheartedly.<br> We believe that jade, if worn long enough,<br> becomes the person who wears it.<br> They have given me something<br> of themselves to take away.<br> Back to earth again.<br> The sun is out. It is a good omen.<br> We don't have to worry about omens.<br> Fate isnt jealous of us.<br> At the airport, I'll make arrangements<br> to fly on to Singapore.<br> At once?<br> This is something I can't handle<br> in a letter. I have to see her.<br> Of course. I will test myself at missing you.<br> You bite your nails.<br> Yes, I know.<br> If you stop, it will be because<br> you are completely peaceful<br> and completely mine.<br> (stewardess) Will passengers make sure<br> to take possessions as they leave the plane?<br> That means you.<br> You've changed since I last saw you.<br> You're radiant. Beautiful.<br> It's Mark.<br> And you used to be so shy and inhibited.<br> It's Mark.<br> Don't keep saying "It's Mark, it's Mark",<br> - as if it's never happened to anyone before.<br> - Not to me.<br> - When does Mark get back?<br> - As soon as he's settled about his divorce.<br> Fat chance he has of getting it.<br> - Why do you say that?<br> - I'm a realist. I've met his wife.<br> She doesn't want him, but will hold onto him<br> until she finds someone she wants.<br> Well, I think Mark will come back<br> free to marry Suyin.<br> Ann, being Mark, would you<br> give up so much to marry me?<br> No, I wouldn't.<br> I consider it quite idiotic of him.<br> And idiotic of you, too. After all,<br> you're quite happy as you are.<br> Oh, well, why spoil everything anyhow?<br> All the fun goes out when you get serious.<br> You must admit it's difficult for Mark.<br> And your being Chinese doesn't<br> make it any easier for him.<br> - You talk too much.<br> - You all talk too much.<br> (Robert) Suyin, it's the hospital.<br> There's a cablegram for you.<br> Dr Han here.<br> Read the cablegram to me, please.<br> Thank you.<br> (Nora) Well, what is it, darling?<br> - It was Mark.<br> - What did he say?<br> He said "I have stopped<br> biting my fingernails."<br> (sobs)<br> - Mark...<br> - She won't release me.<br> I guessed as much when I saw your face.<br> What are we going to do, Suyin?<br> I had prepared myself<br> for the possibility of failure.<br> Nothing is different.<br> I am as much to you<br> as the pleasure I bring you.<br> When I sent you the cable,<br> she had agreed to the divorce.<br> Then later she changed her mind.<br> You're quite right. Nothing is different.<br> We can still hope that<br> she will change her mind again.<br> Mark, go home and rest.<br> I will see you tomorrow.<br> You didn't get enough sleep, did you?<br> How can you tell?<br> I can tell whether you've had enough sleep<br> or worked too hard or had enough to eat.<br> I found a cable waiting.<br> I have to go to Macao on a story.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Then you must go.<br> But I don't want to be<br> away from you for a week.<br> You won't be far.<br> But a whole week, Suyin.<br> Do you think you could<br> join me in a few days?<br> Yes. I'll arrange it.<br> Now, darling, if you think<br> it's unwise, I'll understand.<br> To go on living, one must<br> be occasionally unwise.<br> - Why are you smiling?<br> - Oh, I don't know.<br> The way you walk, the way you talk.<br> Everything about you.<br> I love you, Suyin.<br> (phone rings)<br> - Dr Han here.<br> - Oh, Dr Han?<br> This is Adeline Palmer-Jones here.<br> Could you come over this morning?<br> Oh... Would you mind<br> if Dr Sen came instead?<br> I'm going on holiday. I was just leaving.<br> Well, it is important. I sprained my ankle.<br> Very well. I'll stop by on my way to the boat.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> Oh... It was nice of you to come, Dr Han.<br> - I don't understand. I thought...<br> - I didn't sprain my ankle.<br> I wanted to talk to you. Won't you sit down?<br> I have a taxi waiting, Mrs Palmer-Jones.<br> I'm catching the boat for Macao.<br> That's what I want to talk<br> to you about. Sit down.<br> Now, no one hates gossip more than I do,<br> and nobody is more tolerant than I am.<br> But there are certain conventions<br> that must be observed,<br> especially with this...<br> ticklish situation in China.<br> And there's been some<br> ugly talk about you and Mr Elliott.<br> May I ask what sort of talk?<br> Oh, the usual kind.<br> Mr Elliott is married, you know.<br> I've known that from the beginning.<br> Oh. Well, Mr Palmer-Jones feels that<br> the personnel at the hospital<br> should not be indiscreet.<br> - I thought I should warn you, my dear.<br> - Thank you.<br> Please feel free to call me<br> if you do sprain your ankle.<br> - I'm Dr Han.<br> - Yes, Dr Han.<br> Mr Elliott telephoned. He will be delayed.<br> (speaks Portuguese)<br> I hope you will be comfortable.<br> I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.<br> It isn't often that I do.<br> You locked yourself in. Why?<br> I locked the world out.<br> Oh, Mark, I... I don't know<br> what has happened to me.<br> I'm like a seed, sprouting up, clutching at life.<br> I can hear and... and smell the sun.<br> I am conscious of surfaces and their textures.<br> I have such an awareness.<br> Such an awareness.<br> Oh, pity the poor people<br> with their sad faces,<br> who have missed what we have.<br> You know, I was thinking last night<br> of that line in Thompson's poem:<br> "'Tis ye, 'tis your estranged faces<br> That miss the many-splendored thing."<br> I'm so happy, it frightens me.<br> I have a feeling that heaven is unfair<br> and is preparing for you<br> and for me a great sadness<br> because we have been given so much.<br> Darling, whatever happens,<br> always remember:<br> Nothing is fair nor unfair under heaven.<br> (traditional Chinese)<br> It's a funeral procession.<br> They make it seem so festive.<br> He was a good man... who had a good life.<br> Are you making that up?<br> No. The sign they carry says so.<br> I've always wondered why<br> the relatives walk in the enclosure.<br> They hide their grief.<br> Oh, how good it is to be alive.<br> Two men in the lift are former generals,<br> old friends of my family.<br> - They didn't speak to you.<br> - They realised I was here to see you.<br> It would have been not polite to speak.<br> - Good evening, seor .<br> - Table for two, please.<br> Did you book a reservation?<br> No.<br> This way, please.<br> (speaking Spanish)<br> Mr Elliott. You do not want this table.<br> I can get you a nicer one.<br> No, it's all right, Mr Vicente.<br> This is Dr Han. Mr Vicente is the proprietor.<br> A doctor? Business good?<br> I'm not in private practice.<br> Too bad. Ought to make money now. Woman<br> doctor - make your fortune in no time.<br> Men do not like their wives<br> to be seen by men doctors.<br> - You stay in Macao.<br> - I'll consider it. Thank you.<br> How long will we be in Macao?<br> Can you stay a week?<br> I can't... but I will.<br> Do you think we should be seen together?<br> I want all of my friends to say<br> "Who is that beautiful Chinese girl<br> Mark Elliott's out with?"<br> Eurasian.<br> The gentleman would like champagne?<br> No. Two very dry martinis. Very dry.<br> Trust me. The driest.<br> - Do you know what I'd like to do after?<br> - What?<br> I should like to go to a Chinese fortune-teller<br> and listen to his gorgeous lies.<br> (Mark) The lady would like her fortune told.<br> Fortune written in sand.<br> I would like a lovely fortune, please.<br> Oh...<br> Oh, you very lucky.<br> Going to own big house.<br> Well, not too big.<br> A-ha, many children.<br> How many?<br> Oh, ten children. Maybe 15.<br> How many?<br> Oh, too many. Look again.<br> Four children.<br> Will we have a long and lovely life together?<br> Oh... years very hard to tell.<br> Cost more.<br> I have a feeling he's the one that's<br> gonna wind up with the big house.<br> Inside box, blue beetle and white beetle.<br> White beetle, woman; blue beetle, man.<br> If both beetles go to far box,<br> mean long life together.<br> You watch.<br> You have long life together. 87 year.<br> Thank you. Thank you for a happy future.<br> And thank your blessed beetles, too.<br> There is a cable for you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Wait for me here, would you?<br> - What time is the next boat to Hong Kong?<br> - In about one hour and 50 minutes.<br> - Make reservations for me, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> But why Korea?<br> North Korea invaded the South,<br> crossing the 38th Parallel last night.<br> There isn't much time. We'll have to pack.<br> It's only a little war, isn't it?<br> It's hard to tell.<br> Will it last long?<br> Oh, I don't think very long.<br> Couple of weeks. Maybe three.<br> Could you possibly not go?<br> No, I could not possibly not go.<br> I thought not.<br> Our gorgeous lie did not even last the night.<br> I'm going to the news office.<br> I'll call you the moment I get any information.<br> Oh... Well, good morning, Dr Han.<br> Good morning, Mrs Palmer-Jones.<br> Did you enjoy your trip to Macao?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> We had an explosion in the harbour<br> while you were away.<br> You were badly needed here.<br> My husband was most<br> disturbed at your absence.<br> Well... it's nice that you're back.<br> - Good morning, Dr Han.<br> - Good morning, Dr Sen.<br> Did she tell you?<br> Yes. I'm sorry I wasn't here in the emergency.<br> Did she tell you that your residency<br> here is not being renewed?<br> No.<br> Well, that isn't too important.<br> But I should have been here.<br> Do you think that is the real reason<br> you're being dismissed?<br> No. It is because you are Eurasian.<br> Oh, no, I doubt that, Sen.<br> Anyway, this isn't the only<br> hospital in Hong Kong.<br> You will not be offered another residency.<br> Then I'll go into private practice.<br> Do you think the English will seek you out?<br> They turn to their own kind.<br> That should not be your concern, Sen.<br> Go back to China, Suyin. There you<br> will be given a hospital of your own.<br> Go back to China.<br> I think she's put on a bit of weight.<br> Soap and affection<br> make a world of difference.<br> She's being discharged in my care.<br> Haven't you enough problems already?<br> This is Dr Han. I'm expecting a call.<br> When it comes, will you<br> ring me here, please?<br> Thank you.<br> Extension 3-1.<br> How do you say "Take a deep breath"?<br> Wouldn't it be better if she sang for you?<br> Yes, it would.<br> (speaks Cantonese)<br> (singing "Frere Jacques" in Cantonese)<br> (phone rings)<br> Dr Han here.<br> Suyin, I've just been notified<br> about transportation.<br> Can you meet me in a half an hour?<br> Yes. I'll meet you at the airport.<br> No, I don't want to say goodbye at the airport.<br> On the hill, in half an hour, darling.<br> Mm-hm.<br> How do you turn her off?<br> (speaks Cantonese)<br> Give me your hand.<br> Every woman in love<br> should have a secret garden.<br> And every man in love<br> should have a mountain.<br> Mark... do you remember<br> the man you wanted to interview?<br> The one you said was the first<br> richest person in the world.<br> - Well, he isn't.<br> - You are.<br> - How did you know?<br> - I've learned to read your mind, too.<br> In the next life, let us be birds.<br> According to the laws of reincarnation,<br> in the next life I will be a woman<br> and you will be a man.<br> Oh, no. I refuse to be a man.<br> You have reconciled me to being a woman.<br> All right, I'll take you as you are.<br> I'm sure I should go as limp at the sight<br> of you in the next life as I do in this one.<br> What sort of things will<br> you write about in Korea?<br> Oh, the same sort of things<br> I wrote about in Africa, Indonesia.<br> The cold facts of war.<br> The other things that tell of<br> men afraid, men suffering,<br> people caught up in events<br> they can't understand.<br> Mark, do correspondents ever get killed?<br> Mm-hm.<br> Friend of mine got killed by a bus in Tokyo.<br> If anything happens to you,<br> I shall give up medicine.<br> I would hate my fellow man<br> too much for having hurt you.<br> Then I would be the worst thing<br> that happened to you.<br> And I would know it.<br> - What time should you leave?<br> - Ten minutes ago.<br> War has strapped you to a watch.<br> Unfortunately, my plane leaves on schedule.<br> I wanted to bring you a present,<br> but there wasn't time.<br> You know I've never given you anything?<br> Oh, Mark, what a wrong<br> and dreadful thing to say.<br> What a nice thing to reply.<br> I have to go now,<br> and I don't want you to be sad.<br> I won't be sad. Sadness is so ungrateful.<br> And I don't want you to<br> come down the path with me.<br> I want to look back and see you here.<br> I will be here when you<br> come back to me, I promise.<br> Remember the blue beetle?<br> It promised us a long and happy life.<br> Nora, this is Suyin.<br> Mark is gone, and I've lost<br> my position here at the hospital.<br> Could I stay with you for a while?<br> Oh, for goodness sake, Suyin.<br> Come and stay as long as you like.<br> And could I bring my little Oh-No with me?<br> We both have a need<br> for friends at the moment.<br> You bring Oh-No, Third Uncle,<br> Nine Aunt, anyone you want.<br> Thank you, Nora. It won't be for long.<br> (knock on door)<br> Come in.<br> Yes? Thank you, dear.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Can I talk to you for a moment?<br> - Of course, Dr Sen.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> - When do you leave the hospital, Suyin?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> In a week I'm returning to China.<br> Have you thought about going back?<br> - I must stay in Hong Kong.<br> - Because of Mr Elliott?<br> Yes, as a matter of fact.<br> So you're willing to sacrifice your country<br> for a romantic attachment to one man?<br> - Sen...<br> - A man who won't even marry you.<br> Where's your pride, Suyin?<br> I will not allow you to make me<br> feel small, selfish or ashamed.<br> Forget this man, Suyin.<br> It is a weakness unworthy of you.<br> There's no longer any place<br> in the world for weakness.<br> Then there is no place for doctors, since<br> our approach to weakness is sympathetic.<br> But you feel as we do. I have watched you.<br> You hate the poverty<br> and the pain you see here.<br> I hate it everywhere. But that doesn't<br> make me a Communist like you, Sen.<br> It just makes me try to be a better doctor.<br> China has been reborn, Suyin.<br> Our people are free at last.<br> Sen, refugees pour into Hong Kong<br> at the rate of 3,000 a day.<br> As a man who believes in this new order,<br> doesn't it disturb you that<br> so many flee from freedom?<br> You're no longer Chinese.<br> You're not facing the truth.<br> Look into the mirror and see yourself.<br> Maybe that is the difference<br> in our viewpoints, Sen.<br> You look into the mirror<br> and see truth reflected.<br> But I think it is an illusion.<br> For in the mirror, what is right is left,<br> and what is left is right.<br> (door slams)<br> Ahh...<br> Ooh. (laughs)<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> We drove out to see you<br> and you weren't home.<br> Where have you been?<br> - Job-hunting.<br> - Any luck?<br> Yes, I was offered a job<br> typing medical reports.<br> Suyin, would you go and see<br> Mr Palmer-Jones if I arrange it?<br> I wouldn't have a month ago.<br> - But time has nibbled at my pride.<br> - I'll call him tomorrow.<br> Oh-No. (speaks Cantonese)<br> Oh-No!<br> You read your letter,<br> and we'll go in and fix tea.<br> Is she taking care of herself?<br> She looks worried and tired.<br> I think she looks wonderful<br> for someone with half a heart.<br> (Mark) I have received your letters,<br> number eight and 11,<br> but nine and ten are missing.<br> Wonderful moon at night,<br> each night a little bigger,<br> rising a little farther to the left,<br> taking a little longer to<br> reach the trees on the right.<br> Twice, like a ritual,<br> I read your letter by its light.<br> Last night, wonder of wonders,<br> I not only had a clean camp bed,<br> but I was able to place it<br> so it faced the open window<br> and our friend, the moon.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> I'm picking up Robert.<br> Would you like to come?<br> No, I'll stay.<br> - We'll stop at a cake shop for tea first.<br> - Stop worrying about me.<br> It is difficult enough when<br> I think of your kindness to me.<br> I'm not kind. I'm just practical.<br> With a household full of children,<br> I just wanted a doctor in the house.<br> What on earth are you doing?<br> I'm making a good-luck prayer for Mark.<br> - Oh, Suyin.<br> - I know it is foolish.<br> But I must feel I'm doing<br> something to protect him.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> (Mark) Glory be! Numbers<br> nine and ten finally arrived,<br> old and worn, but mighty welcome.<br> Expect to be in Seoul tomorrow.<br> My bottom is worn to the bone with<br> bouncing about in jeeps on bumpy roads.<br> I used to think I'd run out of<br> things to write you. More fool I...<br> (siren wailing)<br> (sobbing)<br> Oh-No...<br> (speaks Cantonese)<br> (Oh-No speaks Cantonese)<br> It is no one's fault. These things happen.<br> (speaking Cantonese)<br> (radio announcer) UN troops have<br> withdrawn to positions at Pusan.<br> - North Korea is expected to launch...<br> - Stop listening to that.<br> - A letter from Mark.<br> - Thank you.<br> You must have enough letters<br> from him now to start a bonfire.<br> I wouldn't burn them,<br> but they would make a lovely glow.<br> Nora... you know, it often seems that<br> Mark is with me more while<br> he is away than when he is here.<br> - Do you think that's strange?<br> - Well, no, I don't.<br> - Nora.<br> - Oh, here's Ann.<br> Nora, come here a minute.<br> - What is it, Ann?<br> - Hello, Ann.<br> What in the world is the matter?<br> There's something in the paper.<br> - What?<br> - Suyin, it's about Mark.<br> - What about Mark?<br> - No, don't. Don't, Suyin.<br> Dead... or a prisoner?<br> - He's dead.<br> - Oh, sweetheart.<br> It's not true.<br> It's not true.<br> Nora... it's a lie.<br> I won't believe it!<br> (Mark) I do not know<br> what is to happen, darling.<br> But this I do know:<br> Life's greatest tragedy is not to be loved.<br> God has been good to us, Suyin.<br> He is dead.<br> But his letters will come... one by one.<br> They will continue to come<br> one by one.<br> (Mark) Suyin... there is nothing<br> fair nor unfair under heaven.<br> God has been good to us, Suyin.<br> It makes me very proud of you to know<br> that any unhappiness of your own<br> could never blind you to the pain of others.<br> (Mark) Give me your hand.<br> I often think that healing is man's salvation,<br> and I envy your ability to help.<br> You deal with suffering,<br> but you can do something about it.<br> I can only stand and watch.<br> We have not missed, you and I.<br> We have not missed that<br> many-splendored thing.<br> Love is a many-splendored thing<br> It's the April rose that only grows<br> in the early spring<br> Love is nature's way of giving<br> A reason to be living<br> The golden crown that makes a man a king<br> Once on a high and windy hill<br> In the morning mist, two lovers kissed<br> And the world stood still<br> Then your fingers touched my silent heart<br> And taught it how to sing<br> Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing<br>
