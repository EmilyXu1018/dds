                        What's the matter?<br> Let's stop this thing right now.<br> Don't tell me you've<br> fallen in love with her?<br> Roger, you're such a fool.<br> Of course, I am.<br> That's why I asked you<br> to write my love letters for me.<br> Lying my head off for you to a girl<br> I've never even seen.<br> It's not lying. I do love her.<br> Only I've never been able to put<br> fancy feelings into fancy words.<br> Of course. I've never had<br> any fancy feelings.<br> Did you ever have any honest ones?<br> Who me? What about you?<br> Why'd you agree to write<br> for me in the first place?<br> Because I was able to write to her<br> all the things I was never able<br> to say to any woman I know.<br> I always wanted to say them to someone.<br> This seemed the best way.<br> Writing to an unknown girl<br> who wouldn't care.<br> But Victoria cared.<br> Understood.<br> Well, what's wrong?<br> Give me her last letter.<br> Listen to this.<br> And see if you want to go on.<br> "Dear Roger,<br> I loved you long before I met you.<br> I always wanted to find a man who feel<br> and think and write the way you do.<br> The man who would look at life<br> not as a burden or a punishment.<br> But as a dream of beauty<br> which we can make real.<br> It is terrible waiting for you.<br> But finding you<br> was such a great miracle<br> that anything I suffer seems<br> only a small payment in return.<br> Come on, come on. Finish it.<br> Don't take it so seriously.<br> Roger, don't you realize what<br> these letters mean to Victoria?<br> - What does it mean to you?<br> - Nothing.<br> Then why worry?<br> You ought to feel proud.<br> You made her fall in love with me.<br> She's in love with these letters...<br> that you didn't write.<br> With my letters.<br> What is the difference?<br> She's in love with<br> a man who doesn't exist.<br> Oh, well.<br> I'll make a good substitute.<br> That's what you've always been!<br> A substitute. Strictly low-fat.<br> The food in this place is simply awful.<br> But the wine! Mmm.<br> Here. Have some.<br> Orvisto '27.<br> Thanks.<br> It's worth a trip to Italy.<br> Oh-oh. Dirty work, huh?<br> Roger up to his usual standards?<br> I never had any standards.<br> Hmm.<br> Hey hey.<br> Do you have to drink like a pig?<br> Don't you know the difference between<br> a rare vintage and a mug of beer?<br> He doesn't.<br> I never had any standards,<br> manners or taste.<br> - Bragging again?<br> - I am.<br> Senor Capitano.<br> Coming. See you later, fellas.<br> Thanks for the drink.<br> - Alan, what about it?<br> - What about what?<br> The letter from Victoria.<br> Come on. Finish it.<br> Roger, why don't you leave her alone?<br> Let her forget you.<br> This is for you.<br> I like something better occasionally.<br> Get it yourself.<br> I'm not gonna write anymore letters.<br> Come on, Alan.<br> I promise this'll be the last one.<br> We finish it for me?<br> You won't write her anymore letters?<br> I won't write her any more.<br> - Word of honor?<br> - Word of honor.<br> Tell me, do you write<br> this kind of stuff to Helen too?<br> No, I don't write to Helen very often.<br> - You're engaged to her, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> Then what's Victoria to you?<br> Call her...<br> A pinup girl of the spirit.<br> The spirit? Wait till you see her.<br> She's...<br> I don't wanna see her.<br> I don't wanna know who she is.<br> Or what she looks like. Anything.<br> There.<br> I never thought I'd sign my soul<br> with the name of Roger Morley.<br> Address, please.<br> The handwriting is your soul too.<br> To Victoria Remington...<br> Meadow Farm, Longreach...<br> Essex, England.<br> Oh, say. Add a line for me, will you?<br> What?<br> Tell her she'll see me<br> in person in a few days.<br> What?<br> Didn't I tell you?<br> They're sending me<br> back to England for special training.<br> No you didn't tell me.<br> I applied for transfer<br> to the paratroopers months ago.<br> I just got accepted.<br> Come on, write.<br> You want me to give your love<br> to Helen while I'm in England?<br> No. But you might call on my parents.<br> They'd appreciate it.<br> Right-o.<br> Roger, you go to England,<br> don't see Victoria.<br> That, my friend, is the first thing<br> I'll do on the first leave I get!<br> Why shouldn't I?<br> I'm afraid for both of you.<br> Besides, you gave me your word of honor.<br> Not to write to her.<br> I didn't promise not to see her.<br> Besides, honor is old-fashioned.<br> Well, I'm off to England... and Victoria.<br> Good luck, Roger. With the paratroops.<br> Real family resemblance, I'd say.<br> Don't you worry, Mrs. Quinton.<br> Your little boy is quite safe.<br> As safe as he'd be<br> in the old home parlor.<br> Only having a bit of a jollier time.<br> Morland, we've... we've just received<br> word that Alan was wounded in action.<br> Oh, I say, I'm sorry.<br> Not seriously I hope.<br> Critically.<br> Don't take it to hard.<br> They can't get old Alan down.<br> He'll pull through anything.<br> Do you know where he is?<br> He's in a hospital in Italy.<br> I was just writing to him as you came.<br> Mind if I add a postscript?<br> I've got some news that<br> will cheer him up.<br> This would be nice of you.<br> "Just dropped in on your parents,<br> "while on my honeymoon in London.<br> "Victoria and I got married yesterday.<br> "Having lovely time.<br> "Wish you were here. Roger Morland. ".<br> Your mother write such<br> a nice letter, Captain.<br> Captain Quinton?<br> Hmm.<br> I said your mother writes<br> such a nice letter.<br> Yes, doesn't she?<br> I haven't seen her in years.<br> I'm sure you'll see her soon.<br> As bad as that?<br> Oh, no.<br> I mean, you've earned leave.<br> At least a few weeks in England.<br> I'm glad they left enough to ship me.<br> Oh, that's not true, Captain.<br> And if you're sent back,<br> I'm sure it will be with a DSO.<br> He did say they were... married.<br> You don't look very happy, Captain.<br> I'm sure glad to be home in England?<br> Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> I have a surprise for you.<br> Your young lady is here to see you.<br> Victoria?<br> Miss Helen Wentworth.<br> Oh, yes.<br> And who is Victoria, may I ask?<br> Just a name<br> I don't know why I said it.<br> Aw, you should be more careful, Captain.<br> Right here, Miss Wentworth.<br> I must say, Alan.<br> It's as though we've never been parted.<br> Hello, Helen.<br> Isn't this splendid?<br> What, the hospital?<br> You know better than that.<br> I'm very proud of you.<br> All my friends are<br> waiting to hear your story.<br> They're really dreadfully envious...<br> Especially Madge Benton.<br> Do you remember Madge?<br> Her fiancee came back.<br> He hasn't got<br> anything like that to show for it.<br> Now tell me all about it.<br> There's really nothing to tell.<br> Why are you soldiers always so modest?<br> You know, I'm really very angry<br> with you, my dear.<br> Why?<br> You've been back for months.<br> And you haven't allowed me to visit you.<br> Didn't you want to see me?<br> Of course I wanted to see you, Helen.<br> It's just that I...<br> needed a little time.<br> What a funny thing to say.<br> As if I were a stranger.<br> And here I've waited<br> for this moment so impatiently.<br> It's been years, Alan.<br> Years of war.<br> But the war is over for you.<br> Over and done with.<br> You mustn't look back and get morbid.<br> You mustn't.<br> - Alan!<br> - Jim, when did you get here?<br> - Yesterday.<br> - Hello.<br> Miss Wentworth. Jim Connings.<br> How do you do, Lieutenant?<br> Jim and I were<br> in the same outfit overseas.<br> Oh, Lieutenant,<br> you must tell me about Alan.<br> I haven't been able to<br> get anything out of him.<br> What did he do?<br> And what was he decorated for?<br> Aw, nothing much.<br> But enough to win the DSO.<br> Our detachment<br> was practically wiped out<br> But he grabbed a flamethrower.<br> And blasted a pillbox.<br> Single-handedly.<br> Well, Jim. I've lost track of everybody.<br> I didn't know you ended up here too.<br> Yes. That makes two bad pennies<br> coming back.<br> - What about the third one?<br> - Who?<br> Roger. Roger Morland.<br> Ever hear from him?<br> Roger Morland?<br> - Why? Didn't you know?<br> - What?<br> He's dead.<br> Dead in action?<br> No. Here at home. In England.<br> It was an accident.<br> I knew something would happen.<br> Naw. It was just<br> an unfortunate accident.<br> Don't think about it, pal.<br> I'll try not to.<br> Well, I guess I'll hobble along.<br> I'm supposed to give it a workout.<br> - Miss Wentworth.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> - Alan.<br> - Jim.<br> Who was Roger Morland?<br> Someone I met at the front.<br> I don't wanna think about him though.<br> Or anything connected with him.<br> That's just what<br> I was trying to tell you.<br> You must forget the war.<br> You must get out and mix with people.<br> Find some useful work to do.<br> Helen.<br> Helen, try to understand.<br> I think every woman woman<br> should understand...<br> that a returning soldier<br> is not the man she knew<br> and loved before he went away.<br> Nor is the woman the same.<br> Nonsense!<br> Every returning soldier feels that way.<br> But he gets over it.<br> You can't permit yourself<br> to think about it.<br> You can't.<br> Alan, you can't let yourself<br> go to pieces like this.<br> Mother, the doctor told me<br> I've done a wonderful job of putting<br> all the pieces of me back together.<br> That's not what I mean.<br> Why are you avoiding people?<br> Why don't you show<br> an interest in anything?<br> Why do you sit at home with yourself<br> playing that senseless game?<br> Because it senseless.<br> What's the matter with you, Alan?<br> You've been back long enough<br> to decide what you want to do.<br> I have decided.<br> You mean you're not going<br> to live in Beltmarsh?<br> Yes. I'm going there next week. Monday.<br> But, Alan.<br> He never told us anything about it.<br> Mother, why argue?<br> If Aunt Dagmar has the good sense to die<br> and leave the place to Alan.<br> We shouldn't interfere.<br> It'll be good for him.<br> Essex is such dull barren country.<br> There's a place in Essex<br> called Longreach.<br> What about it?<br> Nothing.<br> It's just a name I heard somewhere.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> I think the jokes on you, old man.<br> You were not too fond of Beltmarsh<br> nor of Aunt Dagmar, as I remember.<br> You're right,<br> I never was very fond of her.<br> And somehow I'm sorry now that I wasn't.<br> Good night, Mother.<br> Helen won't like Beltmarsh.<br> We'll ask Helen to see it for herself.<br> As for me, I don't intend<br> to live anywhere else.<br> If it's what you want to do.<br> It's what I want.<br> Today, mother. Tonight, father.<br> Good night.<br> - You know how parents are.<br> - Yes, here.<br> Thanks.<br> You're wise to get out of here.<br> I don't think they realize it.<br> But they're glad I'm going.<br> Of course you can't blame them.<br> I have nothing to give them.<br> They have nothing to give me.<br> How about one last fling<br> together before you leave?<br> My leave's up Tuesday. So let's make<br> it a last party for both of us.<br> Party? I know a girl in Bloombury.<br> Just the right sort.<br> We'll make it Monday night at her flat.<br> Just a few guests.<br> You can go to the station from there.<br> Straight from the train to Beltmarsh.<br> If you wish, it'll be better than<br> all the usual goodbye kisses.<br> Derek, how good to see you.<br> Dilly, here's my brother Alan in person.<br> At your own risk. You asked for him...<br> now take the consequences.<br> I'll take them. How do you do?<br> Why all the flattering interest?<br> Oh, for obvious reasons.<br> I hope I'm not so obvious.<br> But I don't mind sharing you<br> with the others to begin with.<br> - This is Grace Foley, Lt. Stafford.<br> - How do you do, Alan?<br> - This is Grace Campbell.<br> - How do you do?<br> And this is Singleton.<br> Just Singleton?<br> Just Singleton.<br> Hello?<br> What's your name?<br> What's your name, kid?<br> Alan is leaving for the country tonight.<br> And it's up to us to make him regret it.<br> I am glad my place is the last one<br> you'll see you before you leave.<br> Perhaps you'll make it the<br> first when you return.<br> lll look forward to it... if I return.<br> Not certain of it?<br> I'm not certain of anything<br> at the moment.<br> They say this stuff<br> helps clarify things amazing.<br> - It certainly does.<br> - Thank you.<br> My brother's a gentleman<br> who doesn't believe in drinking.<br> Your brother is a gentleman<br> who doesn't believe.<br> What makes you say that?<br> One quarter observation.<br> Three quarters intuition.<br> Intuition about me?<br> About men like you.<br> What other men are like me?<br> I don't know.<br> I've never met one before.<br> Come and sit down.<br> And tell us more about yourself.<br> All men love to talk about themselves.<br> We'd love to hear all about yourself.<br> Well, on second thought,<br> I think I will have a drink.<br> - Hooray!<br> - Hooray!<br> I've never seen her.<br> And never will see her.<br> A promise to be reached in spite<br> of ugliness and instant terror.<br> A promise I'll never reach.<br> We commit unspeakable crimes.<br> We kill each other. We go to war.<br> Would blast out cities to rubble. We...<br> We blast all sense out of our brains.<br> And yet...<br> Always there before our eyes...<br> is that vision of beauty.<br> A beauty we've never seen.<br> But which makes everything<br> we do seem unbearable.<br> Where is everybody?<br> They've gone.<br> You've been standing there... talking<br> to yourself... for the past half hour.<br> I arranged a guard for you.<br> Any objections?<br> No.<br> You're drunk.<br> Oh.<br> Tell me.<br> What was I saying?<br> What was my speech?<br> The usual one. A girl.<br> - You?<br> - No.<br> - Helen, I hope I...<br> - No, not Helen either.<br> Perhaps you better run<br> through the alphabet.<br> Beginning with Abigail<br> and ending with Zenobia.<br> Thank you, I have never known<br> any Zenobia in my life.<br> Tell me. Who is Victoria?<br> I was talking about Victoria?<br> Not so you could be understood.<br> Who is she?<br> I don't know. I've never seen her.<br> And how did she come in?<br> Oh, I wrote to her.<br> Or rather, I wrote<br> for a friend of mine in the Army.<br> He was in love with her.<br> Who?<br> Roger Morland.<br> He married her. And then he died.<br> You wrote letters to Victoria<br> for a boy called Roger Morland?<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Why are you so interested?<br> What I heard you say tonight<br> put me on the track of something.<br> It gave me an idea.<br> It may mean nothing.<br> On the other hand,<br> it may mean a great deal.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm afraid your mind is in no condition<br> to tackle anything subtle.<br> Hmm.<br> Just remember my name. You got it?<br> Dilly Carson.<br> And I want you to remember this evening.<br> How I listened in on you<br> when you were aware of it.<br> Turn it over in your mind when<br> you get down to Beltmarsh.<br> And remember particularly<br> how mysterious I was.<br> Mysterious!<br> Anybody would think a murder<br> had been committed.<br> There has. An old murder.<br> It's all over and done with now.<br> But a murder remains a murder.<br> And goes on affecting people.<br> Look. I wish you'd tell me...<br> No. No, please. Don't ask me anymore.<br> I've told you too much already.<br> You talk about murder.<br> Then you say<br> don't ask me any more questions.<br> We better be going now.<br> I'll see you to the station.<br> Where is Derek? Isn't he coming?<br> You said goodbye to him.<br> He's arranged everything.<br> Your luggage has gone forward,<br> care of your agent.<br> I don't want to go.<br> I want to stay here in town.<br> It would be nice. But it just can't be.<br> Why?<br> When you've been to Beltmarsh<br> a little while,<br> you'll understand better what you want.<br> It's not me.<br> No? What is it then?<br> I told you that I could see<br> beyond your story to some extent.<br> I know things about you.<br> Things that may happen to you<br> that you don't know.<br> Nice things, I hope.<br> Things that better kick into life.<br> Yes. I should say so.<br> If you're the sort of person<br> that I guess you are.<br> Well, Alan. Think it over.<br> At Beltmarsh.<br> Whoa.<br> - We're here, sir.<br> - Hmm?<br> Oh?<br> Anybody home?<br> Hello?<br> Oh!<br> Well.<br> A ghost service.<br> Well, thank you just the same.<br> I am no ghost yet.<br> But not so far from it either.<br> Beware just the same.<br> So this is what has become<br> of little Alan Quinton.<br> Who, may I ask, are you?<br> - You don't remember me?<br> - No.<br> I'm Mack, your Aunt Dagmar's caretaker.<br> Aunt Dagmar's...?<br> - Gargoyle!<br> - Mack!<br> That's right. Now you remember<br> I didn't mean that.<br> That's all right. That's what<br> you boys used to call me.<br> Especially when I kept you<br> out of the duck pond.<br> That was a long time ago.<br> You didn't know you'd inherited me<br> along with the place, did you?<br> I guess I'm Alan Quinton's gargoyle now.<br> Of course you can use one too.<br> If anybody had told me then,<br> that I be glad to see you...<br> You wouldn't have believed it, eh?<br> I never did like this house.<br> I didn't expect to like it. And...<br> Now it's mine.<br> Actually mine.<br> Well, Mr. Alan, that's the first scab.<br> What?<br> When a man's been hurt pretty badly<br> and all open wounds inside,<br> if he can say "it's mine"<br> about about anything at all,<br> the wounds are healing.<br> Thank you, Mack.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> How about some supper?<br> Oh, no. No, thanks.<br> I want to see the house.<br> Do you think you still know<br> your way about the place?<br> Mack, it hasn't been that long<br> since I was here.<br> Your Aunt Dagmar wanted the place<br> kept for you just the way she had it.<br> She thought you'd appreciate<br> the loneliness and quiet<br> of this coming to rest.<br> I like that, Mack... coming to rest.<br> Aye, well,<br> it's a better word than "peace. "<br> Peace has been mouthed about<br> so much these days,<br> they got all of the certitude out of it.<br> There are people ready<br> to bash your brains in<br> because they've got<br> a plan for eternal peace.<br> Sometimes I think<br> there wouldn't be any wars<br> if it wasn't for the peace lovers.<br> Now rest can't mean anything but rest.<br> - Do I smell apples up here?<br> - Aye.<br> There they are, Mr. Alan.<br> Same as they have been year<br> after year for years and years.<br> But now they're ready for eating.<br> Not like when you used to eat them.<br> You remember?<br> Oh, do I remember.<br> There's nothing as assertive<br> as a green Golden Pippin.<br> Aye!<br> Well, this really takes me back.<br> Aunt Dagmar saved everything.<br> "The Golden Vanity"!<br> All the books.<br> Well, look at me.<br> Not a worry in the world.<br> Oh, wait a minute.<br> It's still here.<br> I used to read this one in secret.<br> Oh!<br> This was my favorite.<br> - Remember this one, Mack?<br> - Aye.<br> Your Aunt Dagmar was afraid<br> you'd blow the place up with it.<br> Really?<br> I wonder if the burner's in here..<br> What a collection of junk.<br> Your old cricket cap.<br> It doesn't fit you.<br> Oh, my treasure chest.<br> Aunt Dagmar.<br> - Golden sovereigns.<br> - Aye.<br> Your Aunt Dagmar left those<br> for the girl you choose for yourself.<br> - The girl I chose?<br> - Aye.<br> You haven't chosen?<br> No...<br> I haven't chosen.<br> There you are, sir.<br> To your precious memory, Aunt Dagmar.<br> With many thanks from your nephew<br> Alan Quinton.<br> Come on. Get back. Up you go.<br> Good morning, Mack.<br> Good morning, Mr. Alan.<br> Breakfast in the kitchen as usual?<br> In about an hour.<br> I'm going for a walk first.<br> Address, please.<br> I'm handwriting my soul to:<br> Victoria Remington...<br> Meadow Farm, Longreach...<br> Essex, England.<br> Mack.<br> Oh, Mack.<br> Mack, where are you?<br> Well, what's all this?<br> Hello, Alan.<br> Oh, uh...<br> Hello.<br> You look dreadful.<br> Sorry. I didn't expect you so soon.<br> "I'm sorry I didn't expect you"<br> would've been more truthful, Alan.<br> No, no, I expected you.<br> And you were afraid of me?<br> If you want to put it that way.<br> If you want the truth.<br> The truth is always disagreeable,<br> isn't it?<br> Do let's try<br> to have a pleasant time for once.<br> And not show that it's necessary.<br> I... I believe<br> I'm just in time for breakfast.<br> Our first breakfast together, Helen.<br> Oops.<br> We both know it's to be<br> our first and last breakfast together.<br> And we didn't even spoil our appetite.<br> I think we've both known<br> the truth for long time.<br> Yes.<br> But it was nice of you<br> to let me be the first to say it.<br> It was nice of you to say it.<br> And all I needed to come to my decision<br> was your house.<br> Your man showed me around.<br> What's the matter with the house?<br> I couldn't stand the peace and solitude.<br> I couldn't tolerate<br> that peculiar monstrosity.<br> Mack?<br> He made it plain that I wasn't welcome.<br> I'm sor...<br> Excuse me. You've forgotten something.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sure Mack wasn't rude.<br> No. No, he was was too polite.<br> Don't let's prolong this.<br> I hate farewell scenes.<br> They're in such bad taste.<br> And I really think<br> we had our farewell scene<br> when I came to see you<br> at the hospital the first time.<br> Goodbye and good luck, if if this<br> is where you hope to find it.<br> Thank you, Helen.<br> Mack, I was just thinking, uh...<br> Were you ever in Longreach?<br> No.<br> Not in around fifteen years, I'd say.<br> You happen to know<br> the family there named Remington?<br> - Remington?<br> - Hmm.<br> No. I can't recall.<br> Wait, no!<br> I believe I've heard the name somewhere.<br> Remington.<br> WELL?<br> No. I can't remember where I heard it.<br> Funny though... I have a feeling<br> it was something unpleasant.<br> Something I heard that wasn't good.<br> What?<br> I don't know. I can't remember.<br> I think I'll run down<br> to Longreach tomorrow.<br> I ought to visit<br> the wife of an old friend.<br> An officer who died.<br> He was in my outfit overseas.<br> Just a bit of obligation.<br> A man runs away from London because<br> people keep shoving obligations at him.<br> The first thing he does when he's free<br> is pick himself another obligation.<br> That makes sense, I'd say.<br> It does?<br> Aye.<br> What time will we leave?<br> I'd like to get there<br> as early as possible.<br> We'll have an early breakfast.<br> Oh, uh, Mack.<br> Something bothers you for long time.<br> You know it can't possibly<br> be what you're thinking.<br> But you go on thinking of it.<br> Isn't it better to find out about it?<br> And be disappointed once and for all?<br> Why are you so sure<br> you'll be disappointed?<br> I know I don't want to be.<br> I want to get rid of it. And forget it.<br> Why? She's free...<br> She's a widow now.<br> Oh, stop watching me like a hawk.<br> Like a gargoyle, Mr. Alan.<br> Like a gargoyle.<br> Hi, there.<br> Do you know a place<br> by the name of the Meadow Farm?<br> Everybody in these parts knows it.<br> How do we get there?<br> Just turn to your right and keep going<br> till you reach Meadow Farms.<br> You know you're the first person<br> that asked for Meadow Farms in years.<br> And yet you said it's well-known?<br> Yes. Everybody knows it.<br> But it ain't the same thing.<br> What's not the same thing?<br> Knowing of a place ain't<br> the same thing as visiting it.<br> Thanks.<br> Wait here. I'll be right back.<br> What's your business?<br> I'd like to know<br> whom I'm addressing first.<br> Shall we tell him?<br> Why, certainly tell him.<br> I'll tell him myself.<br> This is Jupp and I'm Todd.<br> So what business?<br> I want to know if Victoria Morland<br> still lives here.<br> What name?<br> Victoria Morland.<br> Victoria Morland don't live here now.<br> Can you tell me where she's gone?<br> She's dead.<br> When did she die?<br> Oh, sometime.<br> When?<br> Oh, about a year ago sometime.<br> Did she die here?<br> No, she went away before that.<br> Where?<br> Oh, London, maybe.<br> Somewhere in London.<br> Why do you want to know?<br> He was a friend of her husband<br> at the front.<br> You mean Roger. He's dead too.<br> Yes.<br> So you can't tell me anything<br> about Victoria Morland?<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> Sorry I troubled you.<br> That's all right.<br> I want you to remember this evening.<br> Turn it over in your mind<br> when you get down to Beltmarsh.<br> An old murder.<br> It's over and forgotten now.<br> But murder remains a murder.<br> And goes on affecting people.<br> - Take me to the station.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Here you're, sir. Here's some more.<br> Thank you.<br> What is it you're looking for, sir?<br> A murder.<br> - When?<br> - About a year ago.<br> A year ago? What kind?<br> We have them by the dozens, sir.<br> Every day.<br> It's specialty of the house.<br> All kinds of victims.<br> All kinds of motives.<br> All kinds of weapons. All kinds of...<br> You're looking<br> for a needle in a haystack, sir.<br> Did you find it, sir?<br> Yes.<br> Who was the murderer?<br> I was.<br> Alan!<br> Oh, is Ms. Billy Carson in?<br> No, but she'll be back in a minute.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you. I'm Alan Quinton.<br> We met you know.<br> That doesn't seem possible.<br> Why?<br> Because if we had,<br> I wouldn't have forgotten you.<br> We have. And you did.<br> Try to think.<br> Won't you help me out a little?<br> No.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thanks.<br> It would be funny<br> to watch you try to remember.<br> Funny maybe. But not very polite.<br> Shall we be polite or honest?<br> Whichever you prefer me to be.<br> I don't like people who try<br> to be what I want them to be.<br> What should they do then?<br> Whatever they like!<br> No matter if anyone<br> approves of it or not.<br> I couldn't possibly say<br> what I'd like to say right now.<br> What?<br> I'd like to say you're lovely.<br> Go ahead, say it. I like to hear it..<br> You're lovely.<br> But you don't remember seeing me before?<br> No.<br> Oh, the iron!<br> Oh! Oh!<br> Oh, that's not so bad.<br> - You know, I...<br> - Tea?<br> Oh, good. Yes.<br> I have a feeling<br> that I should have seen you before.<br> Where?<br> Well, this will sound preposterous...<br> Overseas at the front.<br> - I've never been to the front.<br> - No?<br> There is some connection.<br> No, it was much closer. Remember...<br> Don't tell me. Don't tell me.<br> I'd rather my own memory<br> came back gradually.<br> Yes, that's always better.<br> It's no use when others tell you.<br> But you don't really remember it.<br> But I have a good memory sometimes.<br> I remembered you very well.<br> I noticed you knew my name.<br> Well, you see,<br> I thought of you so much.<br> You think you should admit that?<br> Why not?<br> I wanted to tell you<br> that I thought of you.<br> And you were glad to hear it.<br> Don't look startled. You were glad.<br> So why shouldn't I tell you?<br> No reason at all.<br> What made you think about me?<br> Do you remember being here before?<br> Not especially.<br> Likely at a party..<br> You were drunk.<br> Oh, you heard about that, did you?<br> Yes, Dilly told me.<br> He told me you talked about me<br> when you were drunk.<br> About you?<br> What'd I say?<br> She wouldn't tell me.<br> You're very unhappy.<br> And frightened?<br> Yes, I've heard<br> some very disturbing news today.<br> Could I help you in any way?<br> Perhaps you could.<br> I came to ask Dilly this.<br> Maybe you can tell me.<br> Do you know Victoria Morland?<br> Victoria Morland?<br> No, I've never heard of her.<br> I'm sure she's a friend of Dilly's.<br> No. I know all of Dilly's friends.<br> I've never heard her<br> speak of a Victoria Morland.<br> Never mind. It doesn't matter.<br> It does matter.<br> You're love with her.<br> Whom?<br> Victoria Morland.<br> What made you say that?<br> The way you pronounced her name.<br> And the way you looked.<br> You know that's strange.<br> You knew before I did.<br> I never realized it<br> till I heard you say it.<br> You were in love with her<br> without knowing it?<br> For a long time.<br> Are you lost her?<br> I'd like to help you find her.<br> I'm afraid we could never find her.<br> You will if you want it strongly enough.<br> Look. Who are you?<br> Where'd I met you?<br> Right here in this room at the party.<br> I'm Singleton.<br> Oh, of course. How stupid of me.<br> It's not your fault, really.<br> You were in no condition<br> to remember anyone.<br> He barely drank that night.<br> I wanted to talk to you afterwards.<br> But Dilly kept me away away from you.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> So you're Miss Singleton?<br> Not Miss Singleton, Alan.<br> Just Singleton.<br> What's your first name?<br> I haven't any.<br> What's your first name?<br> I don't remember it.<br> What is the first name, Kitty?<br> You don't remember it?<br> No.<br> - It's Alan, Dilly.<br> - So I see.<br> Good evening.<br> Sorry.<br> It's given me a bit of a shock.<br> I didn't expect you<br> back in town so soon.<br> Well, you told me<br> you hoped your place would be<br> the first one I visited when I returned.<br> I'm glad you made it first.<br> Second, to be exact.<br> I spent the day<br> in the library of the Journal.<br> How long have you been here?<br> It doesn't seem very long.<br> About 15 minutes.<br> We had a wonderful time together.<br> Alan likes me.<br> Can't you keep a secret?<br> Only with people I don't like.<br> Dilly, who is Victoria Morland?<br> Do you know her?<br> No, I don't. Why?<br> Alan thought you knew her.<br> But I don't.<br> We must help him to find her.<br> Why "we"?<br> Because I don't want Alan to be unhappy.<br> Oh, bother.<br> I've forgotten the porridge.<br> We have nothing for breakfast.<br> Darling, would you mind running<br> down to the store before it closes?<br> I'm so tired.<br> Sure, Dilly.<br> Could you by any chance...<br> Dilly.<br> Yes, dear?<br> Don't let Alan get away<br> before I get back.<br> No, I'll hold him for you.<br> And don't forget a one large package<br> of Pearson's breakfast food.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I wish you'd been an acute observer<br> All right. You don't have to explain.<br> I only came here<br> to ask you one question.<br> You know the answer.<br> You practically invited me here for it.<br> Where is Victoria Morland?<br> You've been talking to her<br> for the past 15 minutes.<br> Singleton?<br> Yes, Singleton is Victoria Morland.<br> Or rather Victoria Morland<br> is Singleton now.<br> And maybe for the rest of her life.<br> I don't believe it.<br> The name meant nothing to her.<br> Nobody could put on an act like that.<br> It wasn't an act.<br> The name means nothing to her.<br> Did you tell her about the murder?<br> Of course not. You can't make me<br> believe Singleton is a murderer.<br> Not Singleton. Only Victoria Morland.<br> Now look here.<br> You've been mysterious long enough.<br> How much do you know<br> about Victoria Morland's past?<br> Nothing.<br> She was a foundling.<br> Brought up in an orphanage in Canada.<br> They gave her a name there.<br> Victoria Singleton.<br> When she was 12 years old,<br> Beatrice Remington<br> brought her to England.<br> Who is Beatrice Remington?<br> A lonely bitter old maid<br> who owns Meadow Farms.<br> She worked hard all her life.<br> Made a lot of money.<br> And cared for no one on earth.<br> In old age, she allowed herself<br> her first luxury.<br> A trip to Canada.<br> There she found Singleton,<br> who won her completely.<br> She adopted her.<br> And brought her up as her own.<br> A kind of idol. Guarded and ferocious.<br> She was determined no one would<br> ever hurt Singleton in any way.<br> How'd you come to know her?<br> I was brought up in Longreach.<br> I was Singleton's only friend.<br> Did you know Roger Morland?<br> Oh, yes.<br> We met him together<br> at an officers' dance.<br> Singleton thought he was amusing,<br> good-looking. Nothing more.<br> Then he went away. And he wrote to her.<br> And she fell in love.<br> She fell in love with those letters.<br> With your letters, Alan.<br> I know.<br> Beatrice objected.<br> She didn't trust Roger.<br> Nothing would stop Singleton.<br> She married him<br> three days after his return.<br> I don't know what happened between them.<br> I only know that Singleton wasn't happy.<br> She grew silent.<br> Withdrawn in a strange sort of way.<br> And then it happened.<br> The night before I left for London.<br> I was taking a wardrobe.<br> I was home alone packing.<br> Suddenly, there came<br> a knock at the door.<br> Miss Carson! Come over.<br> Come over right away.<br> What happened?<br> I don't know. I wasn't there.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> When I entered the room,<br> the first thing I saw was Roger<br> lying on the floor... dead.<br> Singleton was sitting<br> by the fireplace in a white dress.<br> The white dress had stains all over.<br> Victoria! Victoria!<br> Who are you?<br> She didn't recognize me anymore.<br> Then I saw on the floor...<br> part of the burned letter.<br> It read:<br> "I think of you, my dearest,<br> as a distant promise of beauty<br> untouched by the world. "<br> Aunt Beatrice!<br> She's had another stroke.<br> Her second stroke. It's her heart.<br> She'd always been afraid of it.<br> What happened?<br> Did you hear me?<br> He...<br> struck...<br> her...<br> "He struck her"<br> were the only words that Miss<br> Beatrice Remington was able to speak<br> before paralysis made it<br> impossible for her to testify.<br> Or throw any light on the case.<br> You're the only ones<br> who can help us find the truth.<br> Do you remember<br> that your husband struck you?<br> Who was my husband?<br> Please, Mrs. Morland. Don't be afraid.<br> You can trust me.<br> I'm your defense counsel.<br> And I'm anxious to help you.<br> Please try to think.<br> You do realize that you're on trial<br> for the murder of your husband?<br> Yes I understand that.<br> And I'm not afraid.<br> Not now.<br> But you see I have sworn<br> to tell the truth.<br> And I don't remember<br> that I had a husband.<br> Don't you want to try and help me?<br> Don't you want to remember?<br> No...<br> I know I should.<br> And I'm trying as hard as I can.<br> But I must tell the truth.<br> And I don't want to remember.<br> I don't know what I did.<br> Or what happened.<br> So long as I don't know it,<br> it never happened.<br> Not really. Not to me.<br> Of course, you can't consider that.<br> You must do what you must.<br> You know what happened. I don't.<br> Try to think back.<br> Think of Roger Morland<br> before you married him.<br> Think of the time when you loved him.<br> I never loved him.<br> How do you know that<br> if you don't remember him?<br> Because I remember the man I loved.<br> Who was he?<br> I don't remember his name or his face.<br> It seems very long ago.<br> He wrote to me.<br> I remember his letters.<br> Tell me, Mr. Phillips, are you happy?<br> Why do you ask that?<br> Because you see,<br> I think very few people are happy.<br> They wait all their lives<br> for something to happen to them.<br> Something great and wonderful.<br> They don't know what it is.<br> But they wait for it.<br> Sometimes it never happens.<br> What they want...<br> is the kind of spirit<br> I found in those letters.<br> The spirit that makes life beautiful.<br> I loved that man.<br> I loved him more than my own life.<br> I still love him.<br> So you can see,<br> I couldn't have loved Roger Morland.<br> A man whom I killed.<br> She was found guilty.<br> Guilty of manslaughter.<br> The fact that Roger struck her<br> was a mitigating incident.<br> Two doctors examined her.<br> And found that she was perfectly sane.<br> She suffered a terrible shock.<br> She lost her memory.<br> But not her life.<br> Amnesia victims are not insane,<br> you know.<br> She was sentenced to one year in prison.<br> - They sent her to jail?<br> - Yes.<br> She spent most of her sentence<br> in the prison hospital.<br> Oh, I don't believe she suffered.<br> I don't believe she knew<br> where she was or cared.<br> She must've known.<br> If she did, she's forgotten it now.<br> Forgotten everything?<br> Roger. Meadow Farms. The trial.<br> The prison. Everything.<br> Even her own name.<br> The only thing she remembers<br> now about her past<br> is her childhood in the orphanage.<br> And the name they gave her there.<br> Singleton. Nothing else.<br> She remembers you.<br> Only because<br> I visited her regularly at the hospital.<br> What about Aunt Beatrice?<br> She doesn't remember<br> Aunt Beatrice at all.<br> Where is Aunt Beatrice now?<br> She's in a nursing home in London.<br> Oh, she recovered. She can speak again.<br> Will Singleton ever recover?<br> What do the doctors think?<br> They warned me<br> never to speak to her about her past.<br> If she regains her memory,<br> it will have to come back gradually,<br> from within, of her own accord.<br> If any one told her about her past now,<br> the shock would be so terrible that<br> she'd probably lose her mind.<br> You realize why I was so terrified<br> when I found you alone with her?<br> And you were<br> questioning her about Victoria Morland?<br> But why did you send for me<br> in the first place?<br> Roger had spoken about you.<br> And I read in the paper<br> that you'd been decorated.<br> You were wounded and coming home.<br> I wanted someone to help me,<br> to advise me.<br> Someone I could trust...<br> who wasn't connected to her past.<br> Now I'm not so sure I'm glad I did.<br> Well, Alan. That's the whole story.<br> I bet you haven't told the worst of it.<br> You know who the real criminal<br> is in this story, don't you?<br> I didn't until I heard you<br> talking the night of the party.<br> Then I realized what happened<br> to Singleton after their wedding.<br> I knew she'd come to hate Roger if she<br> ever found out his real character.<br> I'm responsible for it all.<br> I'm the guilty one.<br> I've made her a murderer.<br> You're the man she loved.<br> You the man she felt she married.<br> She doesn't know it.<br> But you can never tell her.<br> Does she remember my letters?<br> I don't know.<br> If she does,<br> she's still in love with me.<br> But if she finds out that...<br> She'll have to despise me<br> And you? What do you feel for her?<br> Do you mind if I don't answer that?<br> - It's hopeless, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> If you go on like this,<br> it'll be like skating on thin ice.<br> Only the ice will be<br> her life and her sanity... and yours.<br> I know.<br> You won't be happy with a ghost.<br> And you won't be able to face<br> the day when she ceases to be a ghost.<br> What will you say to her<br> when she comes back?<br> Don't worry. I'll think of something.<br> Tell her I left because<br> I'm in love with Victoria Morland.<br> - Hello, Captain Quinton.<br> - Hello. Hello.<br> - I thought you were in London.<br> - Got back Monday.<br> - Good to see you back again.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hello.<br> I've been trying to get you for hours.<br> Singleton has disappeared.<br> Is she at your house by any chance?<br> No. She isn't here.<br> She went out this morning<br> without saying anything.<br> And she hasn't come back.<br> You wait for me. I'll be right in.<br> There's a train in about an hour.<br> What's that, Dilly?<br> Well, say "hello" or something.<br> How long have you been here?<br> About an hour.<br> I heard the telephone ring.<br> But I was afraid it would be Dilly.<br> So I didn't answer.<br> I hope she'd give up before you came in.<br> Now, Singleton!<br> Oh, no. No, please. No, wait.<br> Hello, Singleton.<br> Hello, Alan.<br> Why did you come here?<br> Because I was afraid you'd<br> decided never to see me again.<br> Why would I decide that?<br> Then it was quite all right<br> for me to come here.<br> And you shouldn't be<br> so shocked and embarrassed.<br> Singleton,<br> one just doesn't do these things.<br> It's done.<br> It's quite proper.<br> I know it looks as if I...<br> I was running after you.<br> As if I were in love with you.<br> But you see I know you're<br> in love with someone else.<br> With Victoria Morland.<br> You told me that.<br> - So you can't suspect me...<br> - What?<br> Of making it personal.<br> You see, in a way,<br> Victoria Morland is my chaperone.<br> You just came here impersonally?<br> Not exactly.<br> I wanted to see you.<br> Singleton, look. Dilly is wearing<br> herself to death about you.<br> I'll have to call and tell her where...<br> Why don't you want me to tell her?<br> She'll make me go back.<br> Don't you intend to go back?<br> I suppose I'll have to.<br> I'm so glad.<br> No use asking how or why.<br> If she wants to do something,<br> she just does it.<br> I suppose all the advice<br> I gave you was of no use.<br> No use whatever.<br> Yes, I'll bring her back myself.<br> I'll put her on the train.<br> And keep her there until<br> we get to London.<br> Right.<br> Oh, Alan, please.<br> Not the train that leaves in an hour.<br> All right.<br> The train that leaves in two hours then.<br> - My manners are bad. So are yours.<br> - Why?<br> A host shouldn't be so anxious<br> to be rid of the guest.<br> He shouldn't show that he's annoyed.<br> Singleton, you think I'm annoyed?<br> Yeah.<br> No.<br> Good.<br> I don't think I could ever suspect<br> you of anything personal.<br> Look at yourself.<br> Oh.<br> That's because<br> I walked here from the station.<br> I'm not used to country roads.<br> You walked all the way here<br> from the station?<br> Un-huh.<br> You must be starved, Mack!<br> No no. Mack gave me a lunch.<br> Oh, you've met the old gargoyle?<br> We had a wonderful time together.<br> Yes, we did.<br> He was much nicer<br> than you were about it.<br> Really?<br> Yes, he was much happier to see me.<br> Well, I'm sure he couldn't<br> have been as surprised.<br> Incidentally,<br> how did you get my address?<br> Your brother spoke<br> about it at the party.<br> Oh, you've got a good memory.<br> You don't have to be afraid<br> to speak of that, Alan.<br> It's no secret.<br> I know I have no memory.<br> I suppose Dilly told you about it?<br> Yes.<br> Is that why you're afraid of me?<br> I'm not.<br> Yes, you're. I can feel it.<br> But you mustn't be.<br> Since I have no past,<br> I have no future.<br> Only a moment. Only now.<br> So we can enjoy it<br> without obligations or regrets.<br> Singleton, I'm not afraid of you.<br> Ever since I came back from the war,<br> I've wanted to be alone.<br> I've been miserable with other people.<br> You're the first one with whom<br> I feel at peace.<br> Because you're broken up inside,<br> almost the same as I am.<br> You've been through the war.<br> And you can't bear to look back.<br> I've forgotten.<br> And you don't want to remember.<br> That's the only difference between us.<br> But you're so calm. You have such a...<br> You have such a contagious serenity.<br> I wish I could catch it.<br> You're so happy.<br> I'll tell you my secret.<br> Just two words.<br> Be yourself.<br> You're afraid of that.<br> Everybody is.<br> But I... I have no choice.<br> I can't be anything but myself.<br> I've lost the past.<br> I've lost the fear of people.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> I thought you needed protection!<br> You're teaching me<br> how to protect myself.<br> We could be good friends, Alan.<br> You're in love<br> with Victoria Morland and I...<br> Tell me about Victoria.<br> I'd rather not talk about it.<br> You love her very much?<br> Desperately and hopelessly.<br> You know, for a moment,<br> I was almost envious of her.<br> Singleton, you mustn't think about it.<br> Someday you'll be<br> very happy with her.<br> I don't mind because right now<br> you're happy with me.<br> - Aren't you?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Alan, you'll come to see<br> me every once in a while?<br> Of course I will.<br> But don't write to me. Just come.<br> It frightens me to receive a letter.<br> Why does it frighten you?<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe it's because I can't write.<br> Can't write?<br> No, I can read.<br> But I've forgotten<br> how to make handwritten letters.<br> Dilly wanted to teach me.<br> But not want to learn again.<br> - I'm afraid of it.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know.<br> All right, Singleton.<br> I promise never to write to you.<br> Good.<br> Oh, I forgot to say goodbye to Mack!<br> - Goodbye, Mack.<br> - Better hurry. We're late.<br> Yes. I'm coming.<br> Oh!<br> What's the matter?<br> I broke my heel.<br> Now we'll really miss that train.<br> Oh, no. We won't.<br> - This is wonderful.<br> - Hmm.<br> Wonderful!<br> You'll be carrying me like<br> this all the way to London!<br> Just what I'd like second best.<br> What's first best?<br> Not going to London at all.<br> There.<br> You know,<br> that's the difference between us.<br> You're unhappy because that<br> can never happen again.<br> And I am happy because<br> it's happened once.<br> Oh!<br> Find her. Please return.<br> No questions asked.<br> You're not really angry with me,<br> are you, Dilly?<br> What use would it be if I were?<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Dilly!<br> Can you arrange for me<br> to see Beatrice Remington?<br> What are you thinking of?<br> I know what I want to do.<br> Please arrange it as soon as possible.<br> And tell her all about me.<br> Except about the letters.<br> Good night.<br> Wait. Please.<br> Miss Remington, here's your visitor.<br> Young man, you wish to speak with me?<br> I'm Alan Quinton. Mrs. Remington.<br> I was a friend of Roger Morland.<br> We served together at the front.<br> I'm not concerned with the past.<br> It's as dead in me<br> as it is to that girl.<br> Dead and buried..<br> Sit down.<br> - And come to the point.<br> - Thank you.<br> What do you wish?<br> I wish to marry Singleton.<br> I expect you realize<br> what you're doing.<br> Fully.<br> The girl you call Singleton<br> is not alive.<br> Not a woman.<br> Not herself yet.<br> She may never be.<br> May I ask<br> how you're prepared to face this?<br> I can only tell you<br> that we love each other.<br> If we try to escape,<br> it'll be much worse for both of us<br> than anything that can<br> happen in our marriage.<br> The prospect of a lifetime<br> with a woman in that condition<br> isn't an easy one, is it?<br> But what if she were<br> to regain her health?<br> Mightn't that be worse for you?<br> Much worse.<br> You're proposing to marry<br> two different women at once.<br> Singleton and Victoria Morland.<br> Only one of them<br> can give you her consent.<br> Will Singleton's consent<br> be binding on Victoria?<br> If and when Victoria<br> comes back to life again,<br> Singleton will cease to exist.<br> How will Victoria look at you?<br> What will be her feelings toward you?<br> I've asked myself these very questions.<br> There are no answers.<br> I simply have to take a chance.<br> I love her.<br> Can you be sure<br> that Victoria will love you?<br> I have reason to believe<br> she'll hate me.<br> Don't ask me why. It's just part<br> of that chance I must take.<br> Has Singleton consented to marry you?<br> I haven't asked her yet.<br> I thought I should speak to you first.<br> Of course, you don't know me. But...<br> I know a great deal about you.<br> I've made it my business to inquire.<br> And your answer?<br> I never want to interfere again.<br> I did once.<br> I lived to regret it.<br> What do you mean?<br> What I mean is no concern of yours.<br> Have you obtained<br> the permission of the Church?<br> Could such a marriage be solemnized?<br> The Bishop wants to see Singleton<br> personally before he gets his decision.<br> He asked me to bring her to him.<br> You know that I love my ward very much.<br> Yes.<br> I wanted her to be happy.<br> And for her sake...<br> won't you tell me<br> what happened that night?<br> Have you read yet<br> accounts of the trial?<br> Yes<br> And you still wish<br> to marry her in spite of it?<br> Yes<br> Then that's all you have to know.<br> I shall advise her<br> of the decision of the Church.<br> If you can get the bishop's<br> permission,<br> you'll have my consent.<br> I am glad you came, my child.<br> And I do enjoy talking to you.<br> Well, thank you.<br> It was kind of you to invite us.<br> I've always wanted to see a bishop.<br> For God sakes, Singleton!<br> Well, it's true.<br> Oh what... no.<br> Please do.<br> Oh thank you. It's beautiful.<br> I've never seen anything so beautiful.<br> And this. Isn't this lovely?<br> Tell me. Are you quite content<br> to be called Singleton?<br> Don't you want<br> a Christian name sometime?<br> Oh, no. I don't mind it, really.<br> Lots of people in the Bible<br> got on well with one name.<br> Some others not so well with two.<br> - You read your Bible?<br> - Yes. I do.<br> Do you like reading it?<br> Yes. I like it very much.<br> I particularly like that sentence.<br> "What shall it profit a man<br> if he shall gain the whole world<br> and lose his own soul. "<br> I always feel as if it<br> were written for me.<br> Why?<br> Because, you see,<br> I've lost the whole world.<br> And gained my own soul.<br> That may be true, my child.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, you see, now I can look at<br> the world through my own eyes.<br> As if it were a new world,<br> seen for the first time.<br> That's the way we all should look at it.<br> In spite of our memories.<br> Do you like what you see?<br> Oh yes, I love it.<br> I love everything.<br> I especially like the country.<br> I've never lived in the country.<br> And it's so full of surprises.<br> I love the fields and gardens.<br> You have a beautiful garden.<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> And those trees!<br> What kind of trees are they?<br> Mary, Mary. This is your department.<br> But where have the flowers?<br> We haven't had any for some time.<br> But we're quite proud of our vegetables.<br> - Are you interested in gardening?<br> - Oh, yes, I am.<br> Come along.<br> Thank you. I love to Alan are you...?<br> No, no. I'll wait here.<br> Her mind is clear. Her soul, innocent.<br> Both of you<br> have a great deal of courage.<br> I feel safe<br> in entrusting Singleton to your care.<br> - I shall permit your marriage.<br> - Thank you, sir!<br> Oh, Alan, isn't that beautiful?<br> I think I better get you home.<br> Oh, no, don't. Let's stay.<br> Let's make the day<br> last as long as possible.<br> Do you think<br> that time passes slower outside?<br> No, but once you bring me home,<br> today will be over.<br> It seems such a lovely day.<br> And... and you don't want it<br> to end just yet.<br> I never want it to end.<br> Alan, I'm sorry about the difficulties.<br> What difficulties?<br> Difficulties about me that you<br> had to discuss with the Bishop.<br> How do you know<br> what I discussed with the Bishop?<br> I'd like to think of you being so kind.<br> You went around and consulted people<br> to make sure they'd permit it<br> before you spoke to me.<br> But what about Victoria Morland?<br> Singleton.<br> That's gone and finished.<br> My past is as dead as yours.<br> We're making a new beginning together.<br> You don't want me to ask<br> questions about it?<br> I want you to trust me.<br> I trust you, Alan.<br> I know you love me.<br> But...<br> You can't really know<br> until you find her again.<br> If you don't, you'll never be sure.<br> I am.<br> I am sure.<br> Singleton, if you love me,<br> you'll forget that name.<br> And never think of it again.<br> I love you.<br> Singleton, will you marry me?<br> Singleton!<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't know.<br> I knew what you were going to say.<br> I'd thought about it. I was happy.<br> Yet when I heard you say it...<br> I heard you say<br> "will you marry me?"...<br> something happened.<br> It frightened me. I don't know why.<br> Something out of your past?<br> Alan, there's something in my past.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> But it's something horrible.<br> If I remember,<br> someday it may hurt you.<br> And I couldn't bear to hurt you.<br> Singleton, nothing could<br> hurt me except to lose you.<br> People get married<br> and face the future together.<br> And they're not afraid.<br> We have to face the future and the past.<br> That's the only difference.<br> Say it again.<br> Say it again. I want to see<br> whether it frightens me again.<br> I love you, Singleton.<br> Will you marry me?<br> Yes!<br> I'm worried, Alan.<br> I'm really worried.<br> She's been married before.<br> So what might it do to her?<br> The repetition<br> of such an important event.<br> What is the ceremony brings<br> everything back to her?<br> I wondered about that myself.<br> She's been very happy and excited<br> as a child for the last few days.<br> But this ceremony may bring back<br> all the terrible memories.<br> I know.<br> What if she suddenly awakens<br> to remember<br> she had a husband whom she murdered?<br> And then learned that you were<br> responsible for her tragedy.<br> Aren't you afraid, Alan?<br> I simply can't permit myself to be.<br> They're ready, Mr. Alan.<br> I, Alan, I take thee, Singleton,<br> to my wedded wife.<br> I, Alan, I take thee, Singleton,<br> to my wedded wife.<br> To have and to hold<br> from this day forward.<br> To have and to hold<br> from this day forward.<br> - For better for worse.<br> - For better for worse.<br> - For richer for poorer.<br> - For richer for poorer.<br> - In sickness and in health.<br> - In sickness and in health.<br> - To love and to cherish.<br> - To love and to cherish.<br> - Until death do us part.<br> - Till death do us part.<br> - According to God's holy ordinance,<br> - According to God's holy ordinance,<br> - And thereto I plight thee my trough.<br> - And thereto I plight thee my trough.<br> I, Singleton, take thee, Alan,<br> to my wedded husband.<br> I, Singleton, take thee, Roger,<br> to my...<br> Oh, I'm so sorry. I...<br> What made me say that?<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Don't be afraid, my child.<br> It's natural that a young bride<br> should feel deeply<br> the import of the solemnity.<br> And a mistake can be forgiven.<br> Repeat after me.<br> I, Singleton, take thee, Alan,<br> to my wedded husband.<br> I, Singleton, take thee, Alan,<br> to my wedded husband.<br> To have and to hold<br> from this day forward.<br> To have and to hold<br> from this day forward.<br> How do you like your house?<br> My house!<br> Oh, it sounds wonderful, Alan.<br> My house.<br> And my ring.<br> I love it, Alan, because it's so simple.<br> Oh, it's a beautiful house, Alan.<br> Just beautiful.<br> I love it.<br> Don't you wanna see the rest of it?<br> Oh, of course. I want to see everything.<br> Everything.<br> I want to show this room.<br> Oh!<br> Oh, Alan, how darling.<br> I used to sleep here...<br> when I was much much smaller.<br> Oh, isn't it sweet?<br> Look at that!<br> Oh, wonderful.<br> Who... who is this, Alan?<br> That's me.<br> You? Well, it is!<br> And what's this?<br> Oh, wonderful junk.<br> Oh, Alan, I love your Aunt Dagmar<br> for keeping your room like this.<br> - Left you a wedding gift.<br> - Me?<br> Here.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Hold your hand.<br> Gold sovereigns.<br> Ten gold sovereigns.<br> "They're for the girl<br> you choose for yourself.<br> "But before you give it to her,<br> be sure she is as solid and as true<br> as these coins of pure gold. "<br> I wonder what your Aunt Dagmar<br> would think if she knew.<br> She'd think you're wonderful.<br> Maybe you should only give me<br> five sovereigns now, Alan.<br> And the rest when I awake.<br> When you awake?<br> Well... it's true, isn't it?<br> I'm only half a person now.<br> Singleton, do you think it would make<br> any difference to you or to me<br> if you could remember the past?<br> We're both afraid<br> of the same thing, Alan.<br> There is no answer to that question.<br> I love you.<br> And I think I'll always love you.<br> But I must try to remember.<br> Don't you want me to remember?<br> Of course, I want you to remember.<br> You mustn't force your way<br> into the past.<br> Let it return or not...<br> just as it will.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I didn't care before, darling.<br> But I do now.<br> I went to be your wife...<br> real wife... completely.<br> Only five sovereigns<br> really belong to me now.<br> But I shall earn the rest.<br> And I'm glad I've got to, Alan.<br> Singleton... You really...<br> One, two, three, four, five.<br> My hope chest.<br> Our hope chest.<br> Both have to earn these sovereigns.<br> - Alan.<br> - Tell me.<br> Why in church did I suddenly<br> say that name Roger?<br> You were nervous.<br> Just a slip of the tongue. That's all.<br> Look.<br> Yes, but why Roger?<br> I don't know anybody named Roger.<br> It's not an unusual name.<br> Just the first one you thought of.<br> Could've been any other.<br> I don't know how I came to say it.<br> I was sure of the words.<br> And then, suddenly when I started, it was...<br> It was as if the sentence spoke itself.<br> As if another person spoke it for me.<br> Alan, was there somebody<br> named Roger in my past?<br> Don't you worry about that.<br> No.<br> I don't want to worry about anything today.<br> No.<br> You're taking a risk when<br> you're very happy, isn't it?<br> I'm so afraid to lose you.<br> No.<br> We all know you're thinking.<br> Yeah, we were mostly tired.<br> Hold me then.<br> The first breath of spring.<br> - Ah, lovely. Lovely.<br> - Yes.<br> How is it?<br> Not bad. It's almost as good as mine.<br> Almost? It's perfect.<br> I'll have to learn fast.<br> I have so many things<br> to catch up with.<br> And so many years.<br> Best porridge I ever tasted.<br> You haven't tasted it.<br> Any woman who could be beautiful<br> in the kitchen is really beautiful.<br> More beautiful than Victoria Morland?<br> You still thinking about her?<br> Sometimes I wonder whether...<br> Whether you wouldn't have been<br> happier with a normal woman.<br> Rather than someone who has to be<br> taught everything from the beginning.<br> I'm trying so hard tonight because<br> I must make you forget her.<br> Can't you forget her?<br> I'd like to.<br> It's funny, I...<br> I've forgotten so much.<br> But I can't seem<br> to forget what I want to.<br> But I'll try.<br> It's only the postman.<br> I've never seen him come here before.<br> Why did he frighten you, Mrs. Quinton?<br> I don't know.<br> It's not as if you had<br> somebody in the war.<br> And was afraid of bad news.<br> The war?<br> No, I've no one in the war.<br> But I was doing so well.<br> And then suddenly...<br> It's always something.<br> A letter from Dilly.<br> Oh, how is she?<br> Fine, fine. She sent you her love.<br> Ask her to write to me.<br> No, better... I'll write to her.<br> I must learn to write again, Alan.<br> Oh, you don't have to...<br> if you're uneasy.<br> Yes, that's why I have to.<br> I won't have these things<br> frighten me anymore.<br> - Teach me to write, Alan.<br> - All right.<br> Show me how to write letters.<br> - Now?<br> - Yes, now. Show me how to write.<br> All right. First lesson.<br> Strange.<br> I have never seen<br> your handwriting before, have I, Alan?<br> Of course not. How could you?<br> No, how could I?<br> There I go again.<br> No, no.<br> - Never mind. I'm not really afraid.<br> - No.<br> Set a date. And I'll learn<br> to write by that date.<br> What date?<br> Some holiday.<br> My birthday.<br> When is your birthday?<br> I don't have a birthday.<br> No. You choose a date.<br> And we'll celebrate it from then on.<br> I guess I'm the only person in the world<br> who can decide which she'll be born.<br> When do you want to be born?<br> The 21st of June.<br> The first day of summer.<br> The 21st of June it'll be.<br> Oh!<br> Rags, thank you.<br> Many happy returns of the day,<br> Mrs. Quinton.<br> Oh, Mack!<br> The first of the season.<br> Thank you, Mack. Thanks.<br> Birthday? Who's Birthday?<br> - You forgot.<br> - It's yours?<br> - But I didn't forget.<br> - Mack, why didn't you...?<br> Here's my present to you.<br> The first letter I've ever written.<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you like my letter?<br> It's a beautiful letter.<br> Happy birthday!<br> It surprised me a little, that's all.<br> How'd you happen to write it?<br> I don't know.<br> I just sat down and it wrote itself.<br> The words just came.<br> Alan, I'm improving.<br> I'm remembering things every day.<br> What things?<br> Just bits and pieces. Nothing much.<br> But it's coming back.<br> I remember a beautiful white dress<br> with red stains on it.<br> When was that?<br> I don't know when.<br> But there was music. People dancing.<br> There were a lot of men in uniform.<br> Officers.<br> It was an officer's dance.<br> What else do you remember?<br> That's all.<br> No, there was a boy<br> who was very gay and witty.<br> It was he. He was the one.<br> He made me laugh so hard I spilled<br> a strawberry punch all over my dress.<br> I wish I remembered more about him.<br> But I can't.<br> Don't think about him.<br> Alan, how old do you suppose I am now?<br> I don't know.<br> What about 23?<br> Twenty three? You think that's right?<br> I think that's about right.<br> You can add on a year<br> or take one off if you like.<br> I mustn't forget it now.<br> I'll write it down for you.<br> Oh, no. I can write it myself.<br> Right here in the Bible.<br> In the Bible!<br> Oh, Alan,<br> with all those family names in it?<br> Certainly.<br> You belong here. It's your Bible.<br> Oh, no. It belongs to all these names.<br> But I'd like to add mine.<br> "I am Mrs. Alan Quinton. "<br> "I am Mrs. Alan Quinton. "<br> - "Age, twenty three. "<br> - "Age, twenty three. "<br> On the 21st of June.<br> Don't forget to put the year.<br> Or it'll be no use.<br> What's this, Alan?<br> What's what?<br> This string.<br> I haven't the slightest idea.<br> Look!<br> It seems to go right through the door.<br> Oh!<br> Ohh!<br> Did you do this, Alan?<br> It's a complete mystery to me.<br> Oh, does this go on until London, Alan?<br> I hope not.<br> Oh, look. A car! A new car!<br> It's not exactly new.<br> - Does it work?<br> - Theoretically, it runs.<br> It's mine, all mine?<br> All yours.<br> Happy birthday!<br> I'll never have enough of driving.<br> It's so much more exciting<br> than riding on a train.<br> No stops. No rails. No guards.<br> You go where you please.<br> You know, Alan,<br> I think that's the way to enjoy life.<br> When there's no stops,<br> no rails or no guards.<br> Right.<br> Look, since you like motoring so much,<br> we'll travel to the end of... our coupon.<br> Alan, let's go that way.<br> Oh, that's a bad road to drive.<br> How do you know?<br> Have you ever been there?<br> No, but you can see it.<br> Oh, what's the matter?<br> Is there something there<br> you don't want me to see?<br> Of course not. How could there be?<br> Then let's go back.<br> I want to go that way.<br> All right. If you want to go that way.<br> Longreach! Let's go to Longreach,<br> whatever that is.<br> We have to see everything<br> sooner or later.<br> Sooner or later, here we go.<br> I love discovering new places.<br> - This is also new to me.<br> - Is it?<br> Yes, darling. It is.<br> What a dismal place over there.<br> Don't look at it.<br> It fascinates me.<br> Let's stop at the gate.<br> All right.<br> If you're going to see it, so am I.<br> Looks so neglected and desolate.<br> People don't let this happen<br> to a house without a reason.<br> I wonder why?<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Oh, maybe they know.<br> Good morning.<br> I'm sorry to have startled you.<br> I know we're trespassing.<br> My wife wanted to see the place.<br> Whose house is this? Who owns it?<br> The owner has gone away.<br> It looks like a haunted house.<br> Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you.<br> Maybe I shouldn't have interrupted him.<br> It was rude of me.<br> I shouldn't be so curious.<br> Very rude.<br> Imagine my wife speaking to strange men!<br> I suppose now<br> I'll have to learn how to be a lady.<br> Darling, you don't want to be a lady.<br> Who cares about a lady?<br> Oh darling, our house<br> has never seemed so beautiful.<br> Wonderful house.<br> Oh, it was fun today.<br> You're so gay all the way home.<br> Happiest day of my life.<br> Oh, Alan, look at our garden!<br> Stop! Don't move!<br> I want to see you like this.<br> You're beautiful.<br> Your beautiful and safe.<br> And nothing in the world<br> can never touch you.<br> "I think of you, my dearest<br> as a distant promise of beauty...<br> untouched by the world. "<br> Roger wrote me that to me.<br> His name was Roger!<br> I don't remember his face.<br> But he had a strange handwriting.<br> I loved him.<br> Alan, I loved him!<br> I don't know who he was.<br> I don't know how I lost him.<br> But...<br> His letters.<br> His letters meant so much to me.<br> Nothing will ever be like that again.<br> Singleton!<br> No...<br> No, that's not what he called me.<br> I don't remember what he called me.<br> Oh, Alan. What am I doing to you?<br> All right. I understand.<br> I love you, Alan.<br> I don't want to leave you.<br> Don't let me.<br> I'm so afraid.<br> I don't understand myself anymore.<br> I love you.<br> But I have no right to say it.<br> You have.<br> You mustn't think about it now.<br> You must rest. And think of it calmly.<br> And get used to it.<br> It's only a memory. It's past.<br> You can't change anything.<br> Only will you be patient with me?<br> Will you give me time?<br> Of course.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> You'll forget him.<br> Have you forgot Victoria Morland?<br> Yes, as I've forgot Victoria Morland.<br> But you haven't forgotten her.<br> Victoria Morland.<br> You love her.<br> Singleton!<br> Singleton!<br> Where's Mrs. Quinton?<br> Up in the garden.<br> She was up before I got up.<br> Is there something wrong, Mr. Alan?<br> Good morning early bird!<br> Oh.<br> Hello, Alan.<br> I couldn't sleep so I...<br> I thought I'd come out<br> and pick some berries for breakfast.<br> I'm all right, Alan.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> It's all right.<br> It's only that there<br> something like a fog.<br> And I can't seem to get through it.<br> Shapes come in close I should recognize.<br> And yet when I reach for them,<br> there's nothing there.<br> Yes.<br> I'll help you.<br> Yes, help me, Alan.<br> Then we'll have breakfast together.<br> Arggh!<br> It's blood, Alan! Right here it's blood.<br> No, no. It's fruit stains! That's all.<br> I had a knife in my hand.<br> There was a fire burning.<br> He was on the floor by the fire.<br> There were spots on my white dress.<br> What happened then?<br> What did I do then, Alan?<br> What did I do?<br> No. I don't want to see Aunt Beatrice.<br> Your Aunt Beatrice isn't here. Come on.<br> No, this is not a house.<br> It was another house. It was nice.<br> What happened then, Alan?<br> What did I do?<br> Who was there? Tell me!<br> Tell me what happened, Alan.<br> - Mack!<br> - Yes?<br> I must know. Tell me what happened.<br> What happened? Who would know?<br> I want to know.<br> Help her.<br> I'm afraid. I'm afraid.<br> There isn't anything to fear.<br> I'm afraid of you.<br> - Take care of her, Mack.<br> - All right.<br> Don't let anybody in.<br> Where are you going?<br> London.<br> I must see Miss Beatrice Remington.<br> It's most urgent.<br> Ms. Remington is not here any longer.<br> Not here?<br> No, she has left, sir.<br> Where'd she go?<br> She refused to tell us.<br> We could not hold her.<br> - She left against medical advice.<br> - When?<br> About two weeks ago.<br> I see. Thank you.<br> Why did Mr. Quinton go to London?<br> I don't know, ma'am.. He didn't tell me.<br> Strange. He didn't tell me either.<br> Don't you worry, Mrs. Quinton.<br> Mr. Alan will come back<br> in a couple of hours.<br> He shouldn't.<br> He should never come back.<br> There now, Mrs. Quinton.<br> That's no way to talk.<br> Don't watch me, Mack.<br> Aye, ma'am.<br> Hello, Mrs. Quinton.<br> Not much today.<br> Just one letter for Captain Quinton.<br> There, you see. I'm not afraid.<br> Afraid? Why should you be afraid?<br> I'm not.<br> Beatrice Remington?<br> Beatrice Remington?<br> Beatrice Remington?<br> Beatrice Remington?<br> Singleton.<br> Singleton.<br> Mack!<br> Singleton! Singleton!<br> She's gone, Mr. Alan.<br> I've looked everywhere.<br> - She's gone<br> - Where?<br> I don't know.<br> What happened?<br> I don't know.<br> She seemed all right.<br> She asked me not to watch her.<br> I didn't want to make her angry.<br> So I left her alone.<br> That was the last I saw her.<br> - Did she say anything.<br> - Not a word.<br> She must be somewhere.<br> I've called all the neighbors.<br> But nobody seems to have seen her.<br> I've got to telephone Dilly first.<br> Where are you going?<br> Dodd, go see who it is.<br> Who is it?<br> It's her.<br> Alone?<br> All by herself.<br> - Should I let her in?<br> - Yes.<br> Please forgive me for coming here.<br> I know you don't know me.<br> I am Mrs. Alan Quinton.<br> I need your help.<br> I must find Victoria Morland.<br> Why did you come here?<br> Because<br> I read your letter about Victoria.<br> You know where she is.<br> Why do you wish to find her?<br> Because my husband is in love with her.<br> How do you know that?<br> He loved her once. And then...<br> Something happened. He lost her.<br> He can't seem to forget her.<br> I don't think he ever will.<br> Then it's jealousy<br> that brought you here.<br> Oh, no!<br> You want to save him from a rival.<br> No..<br> I want to give him up.<br> I don't understand.<br> I want to bring Victoria Morland<br> back to him.<br> I'll tell her everything.<br> She'll forgive him.<br> He'll find a new happiness with her.<br> Because you see... I can't<br> stay with him any longer.<br> Because you don't love him?<br> Because I love him so much.<br> I have no right to remain with him.<br> Why?<br> Don't ask me to explain. I can't.<br> I don't remember.<br> But I remember a knife.<br> And the white dress.<br> And a courtroom.<br> They said I killed my husband.<br> I don't want Alan to know.<br> Please!<br> Please help me to save him!<br> Let him find Victoria Morland again.<br> That he'll forget me.<br> Then it won't hurt him so much.<br> Yes.<br> I can help you<br> to find Victoria Morland.<br> Victoria Morland was my ward.<br> A foundling.<br> I adopted her.<br> I was all alone.<br> I'd worked very hard all my life.<br> I thought I loved my farm.<br> I had nothing else to love.<br> I've never had the time.<br> She was a beautiful child.<br> But when I saw her,<br> I knew what I had missed.<br> She made up<br> for all the empty years before.<br> You loved her very much.<br> Yes...<br> I want you to know it.<br> I want you to remember that.<br> I loved her very much.<br> What was she like?<br> Young and restless.<br> She'd never been hurt.<br> I swore she never would.<br> I guarded her as I would<br> guard my own life.<br> I wanted her to have<br> all the happiness I'd missed.<br> But that was wrong.<br> You can't find happiness<br> for another person.<br> You finish<br> by destroying the one you love.<br> I tried to protect her.<br> But I couldn't save her from myself.<br> Or from Roger Morland.<br> Roger Morland?<br> You see, in a way, Roger Morland<br> and I were guilty of the same crime.<br> He tried to get happiness<br> by stealing another man's soul.<br> But you can't do that.<br> It never works.<br> Roger Morland wrote letters.<br> Yes. And Victoria thought she loved him.<br> I didn't want her to marry him.<br> But I couldn't stop her.<br> They eloped.<br> But he wasn't like his letters.<br> No. Very soon, she discovered that.<br> I knew she was unhappy.<br> I couldn't help her.<br> At night, I could hear her.<br> Her room was...<br> ...upstairs, next to mine.<br> I could hear her crying.<br> And then she'd sit for hours...<br> ...In the garden.<br> Without moving. And saying nothing.<br> I couldn't stand to see it.<br> I never questioned her.<br> And then one night,<br> they were alone together.<br> Roger was quarreling...<br> ...In this room.<br> - There was a lamp.<br> - On the table.<br> I could see Victoria's face.<br> She was very pale.<br> I was...<br> ...over here in the kitchen.<br> It's getting cold here, Mrs. Quinton.<br> Don't you hear me?<br> Come over here please.<br> Dodd will light the fire.<br> No. No, I will light it myself.<br> Now I remember.<br> I wore a white dress.<br> I was sitting in that chair,<br> reading my letters.<br> Roger was on the bench, drinking.<br> Of course, I'm drinking.<br> Why shouldn't I?<br> - I'll drink if I want to.<br> - Roger!<br> Why do you keep reading those letters?<br> Because I love you, Roger.<br> I don't want to stop loving you.<br> I want to think of you as you were<br> when you wrote to me.<br> What am I now?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Answer me! What am I now?<br> You're a stranger to me.<br> Oh, leave me alone.<br> And stop staring at me<br> like a judge passing a sentence!<br> Why are you so angry?<br> I snatch a few days leave. And all you<br> want me to do is around and talk.<br> I want to go out and get drunk.<br> Dance and have a good time.<br> What if I did escape<br> to a pub last night.<br> And your fool aunt caught me<br> smiling at a girl.<br> Aunt Beatrice didn't tell me.<br> Well, I'm telling you.<br> And you're gonna like me as I am.<br> Roger.<br> You wrote that you wanted<br> a different kind of happiness.<br> Can you forget those blasted letters?<br> Oh, please, no!<br> These letters are you!<br> I never wrote them!<br> Do you hear me? I never wrote them!<br> Another man wrote them<br> just to amuse himself!<br> And you meant nothing to him, just<br> wish those letters mean nothing to me.<br> I'm sick of competing with a ghost.<br> I gonna solve this!<br> No! No, Roger, no! I love them!<br> Roger! Don't! Please, Roger!<br> Roger, don't burn my letters!<br> Aghhh!<br> My letters! My letters!<br> My letters!<br> My letters!<br> My letters! My letters! My letters!<br> And now you know, Victoria.<br> You realize I shouldn't speak?<br> I couldn't tell them the truth in time.<br> And when I regained my voice,<br> it was too late.<br> I couldn't tell you.<br> You didn't know me.<br> I had to keep silent<br> to protect your sanity.<br> But it made it worse for you.<br> A lie never works...<br> no matter what our motives.<br> I can't even ask you to forgive me.<br> Oh, Aunt Beatrice. It was my fault.<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> It was because I...<br> loved a man that didn't exist.<br> Who was he?<br> Who wrote those letters?<br> We'll never know.<br> I hope you never find him.<br> He is the man we should hate.<br> Hate?<br> Victoria.<br> Yes?<br> Alan?<br> - You heard?<br> - Everything.<br> You wanted to find<br> Victoria Morland for me.<br> For you, Alan. For you.<br> Victoria.<br> Nobody can build happiness on a lie.<br> Beatrice learned that.<br> And Roger Morland and I.<br> Tell me. If you found the man that wrote<br> those letters,<br> would you hate him?<br> I don't know.<br> "I think of you, my dearest,<br> as the distant promise of beauty<br> untouched by the world. "<br> Alan!<br> You think you'll forgive me?<br> It was terrible waiting for you.<br> But finding you<br> was such a great miracle.<br> It makes anything I suffered<br> seems only a small payment in return.<br>
