                        Now, Marty, Marty.<br> Don't get sore, Marty.<br> Who's sore?<br> When Georgie tells me a customer don't<br> wanna pay up his bill, I wanna hear why.<br> Because I'm tired of being<br> milked like a cow every week.<br> Why can't I pay you off?<br> Cut that out, Orry.<br> I run a legitimate laundry.<br> What laundry tells you<br> how many tablecloths to take?<br> My laundry. It's our policy.<br> We want our customers should be clean.<br> Who needs so many tablecloths?<br> Who comes to a place like this to eat?<br> Every customer has a quota.<br> Otherwise, he wouldn't pay me.<br> Mr. Orry.<br> - Mr. Orry.<br> - That's all right. That's all right.<br> - Let go of me!<br> - Oh, it's you again.<br> - She broke my leg. I'm gonna sue.<br> - My dear man.<br> - It was an accident.<br> - Accident? She kicked me on purpose.<br> - Impossible.<br> - I can explain.<br> Did you or did you not<br> kick this customer?<br> Yes. But I warned him.<br> I warned him three times.<br> - You're fired.<br> - That's not fair. He's the one who's wrong.<br> He's got 10 cents for a dance.<br> He can't be wrong.<br> Cash in your ticket and get out of here.<br> The next dance is on the house.<br> Enjoy yourself.<br> But be careful the way you dance.<br> Get him a girl.<br> Marty, you gotta understand my angle.<br> Now, business hasn't been so...<br> Not bad, huh?<br> I could fix it up. She's one of those<br> stage-struck ones. You know the type.<br> Too bad, kid.<br> You gonna pay up, Orry?<br> Or you want we should<br> suspend our service?<br> What'd you have to go<br> and make a fuss for?<br> Why should I let that big ape paw me?<br> - It's natural. They all do it.<br> - Not to me, they don't.<br> Oh, I forgot. You're different.<br> You're going places.<br> That's right.<br> Get wise to yourself.<br> You're not going anyplace.<br> Not till you stop hollering, "Hands off."<br> I'll stop hollering when I want to,<br> not because the customer's always right.<br> Have you had a good look?<br> I understand you wanna go on the stage.<br> Maybe I can help you.<br> Get out of here, or I'll call the manager.<br> This is a private dressing room.<br> Private for employees,<br> which you're not no longer.<br> Well, you want me to help you<br> go on the stage?<br> Why don't you buy a ticket and try<br> your line on one of the employees.<br> - That is, if you have 10 cents.<br> - Lf he has 10 cents?<br> He's the owner of the biggest<br> nightclub laundry in Chicago.<br> I know everybody in the business.<br> They're my customers.<br> - Sure. He can introduce you to a dozen...<br> - Shut up!<br> What are you butting in for?<br> I can't talk?<br> I'll give you one of my cards.<br> - Why should you?<br> - Why not?<br> I like to help a girl when I can.<br> And you got a very excellent personality.<br> I can see that.<br> All I do is write on my card,<br> and they'll put you to work.<br> Oh, I must've left them out in my car.<br> Meet me outside, and I'll...<br> Now what's the matter?<br> I'm not getting into any car with you.<br> Who said you should? Who invited you?<br> I said, meet me at the car.<br> You dope! He's trying to give<br> you a break. Take advantage.<br> Or don't. If you want it, okay.<br> If not, not.<br> - Come on, Claire. Get out.<br> - What?<br> Buy yourself a horse and buggy.<br> Only beat it.<br> What's the matter?<br> You invite me for a pleasant evening...<br> ...I wait who knows how long.<br> - So I changed my mind. Go on, blow.<br> Getting beat up.<br> Been around too long.<br> Marty.<br> Hi, baby.<br> - Honey, I'd like to...<br> - Up an alley.<br> What's your name?<br> - Ruth Etting.<br> - Here.<br> Take this over to the Circle.<br> It's on the North Side.<br> They'll fix you up. Go on, take it.<br> Can I give you a lift someplace?<br> I'm just trying to be agreeable.<br> Don't do me no favors.<br> - You want the card back?<br> - Keep it.<br> Use it in good health.<br> You wanna know<br> what's your trouble, girlie?<br> You ain't got no faith in human nature.<br> That's all?<br> She's obligated, ain't she?<br> So, what are you sitting?<br> Maybe we can catch up with Claire.<br> So she's got a lot of mileage on her.<br> To quote Willie Shakespeare<br> Please lend me your ear<br> My introduction is done with pride<br> This act is known both far and wide<br> His imitations are all the go<br> So here he is, the star of our show<br> Eddie Fulton!<br> One chorus in the next number.<br> We're running late.<br> Hooray for Johnny Alderman.<br> The people's friend.<br> Hey, deal me in.<br> Taking in laundry?<br> I got a sack full of socks.<br> I wish I had.<br> These have to last till payday.<br> Point is, can you last till payday?<br> I get tired just watching you out there.<br> I must be something to watch.<br> I'm just not a dancer, that's all.<br> It seems odd you'd want<br> a job dancing, then.<br> I didn't. They made a mistake.<br> I'm a singer.<br> You had much experience?<br> None so far. I'm just starting.<br> You going about it the right way?<br> What do you mean?<br> Somebody gives me a chance, I'll sing.<br> I've seen a lot of singers fail<br> because they get off to a bad start.<br> Now is when you need coaching,<br> before you form bad habits.<br> And you need special material,<br> arrangements to show off what you've got.<br> That is, if you're serious about it.<br> Oh, I'm serious, all right.<br> I'm also broke.<br> That would take a lot of money.<br> Tell you what, I might work with you<br> a little. Odd hours, after the show.<br> Would you?<br> Oh, that would be wonderful.<br> It would be a pleasure.<br> One artist to another.<br> I have a piano over at my place.<br> It isn't far from here.<br> We could squeeze in<br> quite a bit of time.<br> Wouldn't that be<br> an awful lot of trouble for you?<br> There's some trouble a man<br> doesn't mind getting into.<br> - Get ready. Five minutes.<br> - Saved by the gong.<br> - Johnny.<br> - Finish the hand.<br> - Better get back to your piano.<br> - He said, get ready.<br> What's to get ready?<br> Alderman...<br> ...will you kindly use your head? That one<br> belongs to the Gimp, bought and paid for.<br> - The Gimp?<br> - So don't make trouble for yourself or me.<br> - I got a big investment in this place.<br> - It's funny.<br> - I would've sworn she hasn't been around.<br> - Maybe she hasn't.<br> What she knows,<br> they learn in the cradle.<br> Wait a minute, Frobisher.<br> - Hey, Etling, I'm here.<br> - Hello, Mr. Snyder.<br> I got my own laundry, eight trucks,<br> and she does her own washing.<br> - Well, they treating you right, kid?<br> - They're wonderful to me.<br> Okay, Frobisher, thanks. Blow.<br> Well, I delivered, didn't I? Tell the truth.<br> You thought I was giving you the business.<br> - I've got to go.<br> - Come on, girls.<br> Hey, Frobisher,<br> the kid is staying out of this one.<br> - Sure, sure. Why not?<br> - Don't forget, you owe me 10 cents.<br> No, really, I better go.<br> - No, no, l...<br> - He won't mind.<br> Oh, Mr. Snyder. It's not...<br> There's something I wanna ask you.<br> I'm dancing...<br> That's great, just great.<br> - Tell me, have you ever been to Florida?<br> - No, I haven't.<br> - I hate to bother you...<br> - You'll be crazy about it.<br> - All the girls are nuts about Miami.<br> - The trouble is...<br> ...Mr. Frobisher put me in the chorus...<br> - He won't fire you.<br> There's the worst weather here, cold.<br> In Miami, you swim in the ocean every day.<br> - I don't wanna dance, I wanna sing.<br> - Singing, dancing, what's the difference?<br> You're on the stage, ain't you?<br> In here, Georgie.<br> All set, Marty. Got the train tickets.<br> How do you like that?<br> We're leaving Friday night.<br> - Leaving for where?<br> - For where?<br> For Florida.<br> Girl, you gotta start listening to me.<br> But I don't want to go to Florida.<br> Why not?<br> How do you know you won't like it?<br> You never been there.<br> Why, you'll love it.<br> What's not to like?<br> She thinks it's a line.<br> She thinks I say Miami,<br> I mean Atlantic City.<br> - Georgie, show her the tickets.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Here are the tickets.<br> - Frobisher will keep your job for you.<br> Mr. Snyder, I'm not going.<br> Georgie, get out of here.<br> Beat it.<br> Now, look here, you stupid little broad.<br> Don't you talk to me like that.<br> I'll talk to you any way I like.<br> You know who I am?<br> - Think I let dames get away with anything?<br> - I'm not trying to get away with anything.<br> I didn't ask you for one thing.<br> You didn't ask, but you wanted.<br> I did my share. Who do you think<br> you are, you can be so particular?<br> You get funny, and I'll throw you<br> back to that crummy dance joint.<br> You won't have to. I'll walk back.<br> - What are you doing? What are you doing?<br> - I'm leaving.<br> All I wanted was a chance to sing.<br> And I'll get it.<br> You don't have to do a thing.<br> I'll get it for myself.<br> Hey, Etling! Etling!<br> What's her name? Ruth. Ruthie!<br> Ruthie, come on out, huh?<br> What did I say that was so terrible?<br> What crime did I commit?<br> - Come on, like a good girl, huh?<br> - Want me to drag her out, Marty?<br> Get out of here.<br> - Deal me in.<br> - Well, hurry up.<br> That's all we wait for Etting.<br> All right, kids, rehearsal. Let's go.<br> - Why is it every time we start...?<br> - You take Etting's place.<br> I'm a specialty.<br> - Mr. Snyder wants to see you right away.<br> - I'm working. Sorry.<br> Listen, I asked you nice, didn't I?<br> You want me to ask you not nice?<br> Sure. Might as well have both versions.<br> Johnny.<br> You think the Gimp found out<br> you talked to the girl?<br> Maybe. If he has, you think I should<br> crawl into the laundry and apologize?<br> Well, I would.<br> But I'm an old man, I want to live.<br> What else have I got?<br> You better go.<br> But, Mr. Frobisher,<br> we can't rehearse without music.<br> - So hum to them.<br> - Hum?<br> All right, girls, line up.<br> Come on, line up.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> You notice how the help<br> all wears gloves?<br> Once the wash is washed,<br> it ain't touched by a human hand.<br> Maybe I'm crazy, but I like things clean.<br> Sit down, make yourself comfortable.<br> - Marty, the piano player.<br> - Hello.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> How much you get an hour to coach?<br> - Coach?<br> - Miss Etling.<br> She wants to sing.<br> She's got some idea<br> she shouldn't make bad habits.<br> She should have arrangements,<br> you know what I mean?<br> What do you get by the hour?<br> - Five dollars.<br> - I'll give you 10.<br> Anybody hangs around me,<br> they make.<br> Well, can she sing?<br> What is she, a dummy?<br> Anybody can sing.<br> You put them on the stage,<br> tell the public they're singers.<br> What does the public know?<br> You want the job?<br> - At 10 bucks an hour? Sure.<br> - You got yourself a deal.<br> Georgie will take you back.<br> When would you like to start?<br> - Well...<br> - You can fix it up between you later.<br> Don't take it too serious.<br> A couple lessons to make her feel good.<br> I'll be taking her to Florida any day now.<br> You know what I mean.<br> I'm sorry I took so long changing.<br> I'm getting paid by the hour.<br> - By the way, thanks for cutting me in.<br> - I got the idea from you.<br> But I would've done it for nothing.<br> I thought it was better if you got paid.<br> - Let's start and see what we got.<br> - All right.<br> Do you know this?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Am I any good?<br> - Am I good enough to get somewhere?<br> - Yeah.<br> Will you tell that to Mr. Snyder?<br> I need someone like him.<br> You know, sort of a manager.<br> - You're expecting him to be your manager?<br> - He has a lot of connections.<br> - You're kidding, aren't you?<br> - No.<br> You were quick to spot a routine<br> friendly pass when I made it.<br> You must have a vague idea<br> of what he wants.<br> Do you know what his exact plans<br> for you are?<br> He's taking you to Florida with him.<br> He told me so himself.<br> He told me that too.<br> But I'm not packing.<br> - Oh, I had a date. I forgot.<br> - I wouldn't tell him.<br> Think fast, kid.<br> Now, just out of plain,<br> simple curiosity...<br> ...why did you give me a stand-up?<br> I told her myself, Marty.<br> Let me hear the fancy story<br> you're gonna give me. I dare you.<br> No story, Mr. Snyder. I just forgot.<br> You forgot?<br> I don't know how I could have,<br> but I did.<br> - And I'm very sorry. Will you forgive me?<br> - Naturally, I thought...<br> - Well, I didn't know what to think.<br> - You didn't think I'd do that to you.<br> That's all right, dear.<br> Everybody can make a mistake.<br> - How's she doing?<br> - Well, not bad. Not bad at all.<br> In fact, she's quite a performer.<br> Did you hear that?<br> Will you talk to Mr. Frobisher<br> and ask him if I can have a little song?<br> I'll talk to him when I get good<br> and ready. How do you like that?<br> You had one lesson.<br> It's time for a swelled head?<br> You think you can fool the public?<br> You wanna embarrass me?<br> I'm sorry. It's just been<br> on my mind, you know.<br> I guess this is my night<br> for making mistakes.<br> It's because you're tired.<br> You're not thinking good.<br> You got no business keeping her up.<br> I'll take you home.<br> You go right to bed.<br> Thank you.<br> To quote Willie Shakespeare<br> Please lend me your ear<br> My introduction is done with pride<br> This act is known both far and wide<br> His imitations are all the go<br> So here he is, the star of our show<br> Eddie Fulton!<br> - Fulton! Where's Fulton?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Fulton, you're on!<br> - Great! Great!<br> - What'd I tell you? A knockout!<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> - Fulton! Fulton, hurry up!<br> - You're on.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Lf it's hard to get here, quit.<br> Why not spend all your time at the<br> craps table. And don't forget, smile.<br> Well, you got what you wanted, huh?<br> What's the matter? You wanted<br> a chance to sing, and I got you a chance.<br> - I'm on and off in a second.<br> - What'd you expect?<br> Well, it's not a real number.<br> I was just thinking of something.<br> Suppose Fulton missed<br> a performance. If I could...<br> Fulton? But he's a headliner.<br> You're a newcomer. You just started.<br> Well, somebody would<br> have to take his place.<br> Well, how do you like that.<br> I'm suspecting she wants me to<br> work Frobisher for an extra routine...<br> ...but she wants the whole business.<br> What do you want me to do,<br> knock him off?<br> Oh, of course not, Mr. Snyder.<br> - But if he missed a show...<br> - Why should he? Answer me that.<br> Well, it could happen, couldn't it?<br> It almost happened tonight, didn't it?<br> The nerve you got.<br> The gall.<br> Look, will you consider coming into<br> the laundry business with me?<br> We'll be millionaires in no time.<br> Marty, I tell you, no.<br> You've got a laundry,<br> I'm a customer. Fine.<br> You asked me to give her a job,<br> I give her a job. Fine.<br> But there's a limit. I'm not putting<br> her on tonight or any other night.<br> - But you're stuck. You ain't got Fulton.<br> - Yeah. Why?<br> Why should he walk out on me?<br> He got in too deep with the gambling.<br> The poor slob didn't have it.<br> Well, how come the poor slob<br> has it to go to Florida, huh?<br> What are you asking me?<br> Frobisher, she'll be a sensation.<br> To who? Whoever heard of her?<br> Who will come to see her?<br> - You wanna close my club?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> You know the contacts I got.<br> People who would be a credit<br> to the finest nightclubs.<br> They'll spend, they'll clap,<br> you'll make a fortune.<br> On the other hand, Frobisher...<br> ...maybe I got you all wrong.<br> Maybe you don't wanna oblige<br> a close, personal pal.<br> Come in.<br> - How do I look?<br> - Top of the world.<br> Oh, here it is, Johnny.<br> The chance I've been waiting for.<br> But you made sure<br> it wasn't too long a wait.<br> You bet I did. I'm in a hurry.<br> And I was right.<br> I told you he'd help me.<br> Ruth, get rid of him.<br> Get rid of him now.<br> It's not gonna be worth it.<br> I don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> - Why shouldn't I have a manager?<br> - A manager? Don't lie to yourself.<br> If you're going ahead with this,<br> at least don't lie to yourself.<br> But don't go ahead with it.<br> You don't have to.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I've tried it without help.<br> I didn't mind it being hard, Johnny.<br> I just minded that it didn't work.<br> Then let me help you.<br> I'll get you to the right people,<br> and they'll want you.<br> They won't have to be<br> strong-armed or blackmailed.<br> They'll want you because you're good.<br> Oh, try it, Ruth. Try it that way.<br> Johnny, so many guys<br> have wanted to help me.<br> And they've all been<br> on the make, just like him.<br> I suppose you're the one<br> who's different.<br> That's right.<br> And I mean it.<br> But get yourself free, Ruth.<br> But I am free. I've made no promises.<br> I'm as free as you are.<br> - Are you?<br> - Yes.<br> Prove it.<br> Let's meet tonight after the show.<br> Have a cup of coffee together.<br> Just two free people getting together<br> over a cup of coffee. Why not, huh?<br> All right.<br> That's us. Be great.<br> - I'm ready. I'm ready.<br> - Come on. It's time.<br> Get on there and don't<br> make me out a horse's neck.<br> I got the place packed with biggies.<br> Get a load of that.<br> "Ruth Etting, Chicago's Sweetheart."<br> - Mr. Sny...<br> - Come on. I'm a nervous wreck.<br> Excuse me.<br> Look at the flowers.<br> Just a little token of the way I feel.<br> Oh, Marty. Thank you, they're lovely.<br> Don't thank me<br> and throw me out so quick.<br> - I have to get dressed.<br> - Make it fast because we gotta celebrate.<br> - Oh, Marty.<br> - What?<br> I'm so tired and excited,<br> I don't think I can go out.<br> Sure, you can. It's all set up.<br> - A fancy blowout at Al Gaxley's place.<br> - That's way out in Bay Cliff.<br> Yeah, sort of a house party for the<br> weekend. Now, hurry up. We gotta leave.<br> But, Marty, look, why don't you<br> go ahead without me.<br> No.<br> - It's just that I'm so tired.<br> - No.<br> Not this time, Ruthie.<br> That's all over.<br> What are you talking about?<br> About the way you brush me off.<br> The way you stall me.<br> Don't think I didn't feel ridiculous<br> at times. In front of Georgie, even.<br> - Just because...<br> - I didn't get sore. Tell the truth.<br> Did I ever get sore?<br> Even about not going to Florida?<br> Now, you wanted to see<br> how far you could get. Fine.<br> I don't blame you.<br> I give you credit. But that's all.<br> I understand.<br> You got me a break, and now...<br> All right.<br> I'll go with you.<br> Now you're talking, baby.<br> - And then you'll never see me again.<br> - Why?<br> Because that makes me a tramp,<br> and I'm not. No matter what you think.<br> Ruthie, you're wrong.<br> Listen. Well, I'll be honest with you.<br> When we first started up together,<br> I figured, you know, a pickup. Why not?<br> Didn't mean nothing.<br> But lately, a change come over me.<br> I wanna do things for you. I'm anxious.<br> That's what I was hoping for.<br> That you would care about me.<br> But you don't.<br> What do you mean, I don't?<br> I'll show you you're out of your head.<br> You know that joint across the street where<br> Helen Terral is singing? The Oval Room?<br> Who do you think I had here tonight taking<br> a gander at you? Just the owner, that's all.<br> A close, personal pal. We're getting<br> together Monday to chew it over.<br> Now does that sound like I think<br> you're a tr...? A what you said.<br> You got no idea the plans I've got.<br> If I go to Al Gaxley's for the weekend.<br> Well, what do you want of me?<br> I'm human.<br> I'm stuck on you.<br> Thank you, Marty.<br> Now let me be honest with you too.<br> In the time that I've known you, you've<br> become more important to me than anyone.<br> And I like you...<br> ...but I'm not stuck on you.<br> Maybe it's because getting someplace<br> is such a big thing to me.<br> It seems as if I don't have room<br> for anything else.<br> Not yet anyway.<br> Can you understand that?<br> Yeah, sure, Ruthie. Sure, but...<br> But when?<br> I don't know.<br> If you still want me to go,<br> give me a minute and I'll get dressed.<br> Take yourself the minute.<br> We'll go out and get a bite to eat.<br> Marty...<br> ...you'll never be sorry.<br> What do you mean?<br> I'm sorry already.<br> I'll wait for you out in the car.<br> Only hurry up.<br> What a day I've had.<br> My feet are killing me.<br> Hey, Marty.<br> We're going downtown<br> to get a bite to eat.<br> Call the restaurant.<br> Tell them to get the champagne ready.<br> She don't wanna go away with you?<br> I don't want her to go,<br> how do you like that?<br> Bay Cliff ain't the right kind of place<br> for a girl like her.<br> - She was great tonight, huh? A knockout.<br> - Yeah, great.<br> Here.<br> A little extra. You backed her up good.<br> Go on, take it.<br> Get yourself a dame.<br> Have a big time on me.<br> Table for three for Mr. Snyder. Yeah.<br> And champagne.<br> Yeah, that's right, the works. Right.<br> Come on, Ruthie!<br> Good night, Johnny.<br> This is on the level. This is legit.<br> I don't have to stack the joint no more.<br> Hey, Marty, Marty! Sit five minutes.<br> There's things I gotta talk to you about.<br> You're so busy all the time.<br> For instance, the laundry!<br> You take care of it.<br> I got confidence in you.<br> I gotta get back.<br> She'll wonder I'm not there.<br> Hi.<br> I want you to meet Mr. Loomis<br> of the Roger Black Agency.<br> - This is Mr. Snyder.<br> - How do you do?<br> Mr. Loomis caught the show.<br> He liked it.<br> He has a booking for me in New York.<br> A club called The Black Hat.<br> - I hear it stinks.<br> - Well, it's a beginning, Mr. Snyder.<br> We're not starting at the beginning.<br> Or maybe I'm out of line. Maybe you're<br> handling your own booking now.<br> You got it straight?<br> Talk business, talk to me.<br> - All right.<br> - My card.<br> Call me up, make an appointment.<br> If I have time, I'll see you.<br> Well, thank you very much, Mr. Snyder.<br> - It was nice seeing you, Miss Etting.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you for coming back.<br> - Oh, it was a pleasure.<br> Why do you act like that?<br> - All that man wanted...<br> - Shut up!<br> Who got you this far, you?<br> Look at me when I'm talking to you!<br> Knock myself out for you.<br> Show me a little respect.<br> At least do that much.<br> You know that Black Hat<br> he's booking you in?<br> It's a dump.<br> You know where it's located?<br> So far uptown, it's practically<br> in the Bronx.<br> You know who goes in there? Dogs!<br> Now, if you wanna sing for dogs,<br> go ahead. But not with me.<br> How was I to know that?<br> - I heard New York. Naturally, I was excited.<br> - New York's crawling with dames can sing.<br> You know when you're going? After I<br> make their tongues hang out for you.<br> I've got plans for you so big you<br> wouldn't understand, a hick like you.<br> What plans?<br> Look whose tongue is hanging out now.<br> Well, never you mind what plans.<br> All you gotta do is sing.<br> The real work, I'll do.<br> Come on, hurry up, get dressed.<br> - Who was the guy came out?<br> - Chiselers. Leeches.<br> You got something good,<br> everybody wants a piece.<br> Listen, Georgie...<br> ...I wanna put her on the radio.<br> Find out who the top man is<br> at every station.<br> Ask around which one we can<br> put the squeeze on.<br> - You know what I mean?<br> - Yeah, but, Marty...<br> ...wouldn't it be easier to ask them<br> come and listen?<br> - Bet you anything they'd give her a job.<br> - Think so?<br> Why not? She sings real good.<br> At that you might be right...<br> ...but if you ain't and it don't work,<br> I'll guarantee you one thing. I'll brain you.<br> - Hey, you. You know anything about radio?<br> - Yes, a little.<br> Good. We're branching out.<br> - Hi, Johnny. Come in.<br> - Hello.<br> Oh, he can't make it. I think he had<br> something to do about his laundry.<br> Anyway, he said for us to go ahead<br> and rehearse.<br> - Pretty fancy, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Marty had it decorated for me<br> as a birthday present.<br> It's the first real apartment<br> I've ever had. I just love it.<br> Can I get you a drink or something?<br> Cup of coffee, maybe?<br> Not now, thank you.<br> - Did you go to the radio station?<br> - Yes. I spent the morning...<br> ...outlining the first program.<br> Oh, Johnny, I still can't believe it.<br> My own radio program.<br> The best possible time on the air.<br> And how about you, maestro?<br> Conducting your own orchestra.<br> Very impressive, both of us.<br> Ruth...<br> ...what happened when that agent<br> came to see you?<br> - He had a booking.<br> - That's what I thought.<br> Well, why didn't you take it?<br> I'm not ready for it yet.<br> And Marty will tell you<br> when you're ready?<br> - He's made no mistakes.<br> - Loomis doesn't make mistakes.<br> He's the best agent in the business.<br> He works for you, you pay a commission,<br> and you don't owe him anything.<br> - Let him handle you.<br> - I don't need him.<br> - Did Marty tell you that?<br> - I don't need him, because I have Marty.<br> You have Marty.<br> You'll have him for a long time.<br> - He'll be right there every step.<br> - Let me tell you something.<br> When it's right for me,<br> I'll be on my own.<br> Use him, then ditch him<br> at the strategic moment?<br> - Charming plan.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> I don't have any plans.<br> You make it sound as if...<br> - Why do you always start something?<br> - I don't. I just have an effect on you.<br> With me, you let yourself look<br> at what you're doing.<br> Don't blame me if it shocks even you.<br> Let's go to work.<br> I'm sick of having you around.<br> Why don't you quit.<br> - Tell the Gimp to fire me.<br> - You think I can't?<br> I know you can. Why don't you?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Suppose I tell you.<br> Let's find him, Ruth, now.<br> Let's tell him.<br> No.<br> There's nothing to tell him.<br> Nothing's changed.<br> - Nothing.<br> - Ruth, darling...<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> I been asking you the same thing for weeks.<br> Is she gonna sign with us again or not?<br> How long can I stall this sponsor?<br> What does she want?<br> - Just half of Chicago.<br> - Hey, Marty, I got him.<br> Relax, Brelston. In a couple of minutes,<br> you'll know as much as I do.<br> Loomis? Go ahead. What?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> They agreed to everything?<br> All right. We'll make it.<br> I'll contact you. Yeah.<br> Yeah, Marty? What she wanted?<br> New York?<br> - That's swell. When we gonna go?<br> - Couple of days.<br> I don't know how smart it is.<br> Well, anyway, it's done.<br> You gotta stay here, Georgie.<br> You gotta mind the laundry.<br> - Sure.<br> - Look, how far away is New York?<br> - You'll make visits lots of times.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well?<br> - No dice, Brelston.<br> - What do you mean?<br> What's the sense of half of Chicago?<br> She's gonna have all of New York.<br> Ladies and gentlemen.<br> I wanna invite you to a party<br> I'm throwing over at the Plaza for Ruthie.<br> Quiet, I ain't through.<br> It was on account of winding up<br> the program.<br> Now it's for something more important.<br> Something Ruthie doesn't know yet.<br> She's going to New York.<br> - New York?<br> - She's gonna be in the Ziegfeld Follies!<br> Congratulations!<br> - All right, boys. I'll see you at the party.<br> - Oh, Marty.<br> - Just great. Don't be late.<br> - I'm so excited.<br> Told you I'd get the best for you.<br> - Now maybe you'll have a little confidence.<br> - I do have. I always have had.<br> - You're coming to the party?<br> - I'm sorry, I can't. Thank you.<br> Pretty good, huh? Ziegfeld?<br> - Will you be ready to leave?<br> - No, I'm not going to New York.<br> - What?<br> - I'll meet you at the Plaza, Marty.<br> Wait a minute, Ruthie. All right, Georgie,<br> take her to the car.<br> What's the big idea?<br> I've had another offer out in California.<br> Seems interesting.<br> Well, there's gratitude for you.<br> There's nothing I can do for Ruth.<br> She's made it.<br> - Are you going?<br> - Yeah, I'm going.<br> You bet your sweet life I'm going.<br> She's gonna need me the longest day<br> she lives. No matter what you think!<br> - No matter what I think?<br> - Yeah. And I know what you think.<br> Her having to do with me.<br> I know what you think about me too.<br> A jerk, a dumb mug, strictly for laughs.<br> No. A cheap crook,<br> pushing people around.<br> - I ever push Ruthie around?<br> - You will, pal. You will.<br> Wise guy. You know everything.<br> You don't know nothing.<br> You wouldn't know about<br> how I feel about Ruthie.<br> A girl like that. You don't know nothing.<br> What I come from, the kind of a place.<br> Same place I did, Snyder.<br> Same place, same street,<br> same everything.<br> Me and 1000 other guys,<br> and they don't turn out like you.<br> And who's she going with?<br> Answer me that, smart guy.<br> Who is she going with?<br> There's only one thing I got against you,<br> you poor slob.<br> I'm sorry you quit.<br> I would have liked to fire you.<br> Come down the steps, now. That's it.<br> Good. Boys, come down farther. Good.<br> Now, forward. That's it.<br> Arms, boys, arms. That's it.<br> Keep coming forward.<br> - I stay here, don't I?<br> - Right there.<br> That's okay.<br> Just a little bit more forward. That's it.<br> Fine. All right. Fellas, cross over here.<br> Cross over there.<br> You stay there, Ruth.<br> We'll fix it later.<br> That's it. Now, move forward a little.<br> That's it.<br> Now, you go back. Back. That's it,<br> all the way back.<br> Now you do the same thing.<br> Coming forward.<br> Clear the way so she can get through.<br> Come on, that's it.<br> That's good. Come on, boys.<br> That's fine. Good. A little bit more.<br> All right, all right, all right.<br> - That's all.<br> - All right, lunch, everybody. Back at 2.<br> - Same number, same people.<br> - Same mistakes.<br> - I seem to do everything wrong.<br> - No, it's me.<br> I haven't turned on the magic.<br> Take off the worried face and get lunch.<br> It's in your dressing room.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld ordered it.<br> Thank you.<br> - Doesn't everyone get spoiled rotten?<br> - No, we just choose a select few.<br> - Bye.<br> - Hey, Trent, don't go!<br> - I wanna talk to you!<br> - Now, Marty...<br> Oh, Mr. Snyder. I didn't know you were<br> honoring us today.<br> Today and every day!<br> And I still say it's lousy.<br> All week I've been trying to tell you.<br> Look at the way you've been handling her!<br> Guys prancing, hiding her. It's crummy.<br> Sorry you don't like my work.<br> You'd better tell Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> I'm telling you. And don't give me<br> that fish eye of yours either.<br> I know what's good for her and what ain't.<br> Ought to by this time.<br> - She never made a move I didn't tell her.<br> - I'm sure she found your advice invaluable.<br> - Perhaps you're more talented than I.<br> - You ain't kidding. You stink!<br> Fred! This is beginning to lose<br> its amusement value.<br> - I'll take care of it.<br> - Beat it.<br> I told you, I don't do business<br> with assistants. I'm talking to him.<br> No, you're not.<br> - Why, you...<br> - Just a minute.<br> - Take your hands off me.<br> - Fred, let me.<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> You can't act like a hoodlum in here.<br> You think like Ruthie, it's some church?<br> Mention Ziegfeld, everybody kneels down?<br> I'm thinking of her. What you're doing<br> to her, what you've been doing to her.<br> - I gotta look out for her.<br> - They're looking out for her.<br> They're the best in the business.<br> They'll make a big star out of her.<br> But you can't shove them around.<br> Yeah. You don't have to worry<br> about me.<br> I don't wanna do nothing to hurt Ruthie,<br> but I'm just used to taking care.<br> - I just can't sit and do nothing for her.<br> - I know, Marty.<br> And I understand.<br> - You wanna have a cup of coffee?<br> - Sure. I'd like it.<br> - As a matter of fact, I'll buy you lunch.<br> - You'll buy?<br> I'll buy. Come on.<br> I think I'll go see her for a minute.<br> No, wait, Marty. Wait till after the show.<br> Very good, Ruth. Take another bow.<br> You've got them, you've got them!<br> Keep with it, Ruth. Keep belting!<br> - Oh, Miss Etting, you were just wonderful!<br> - Thank you. We have to hurry.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Snyder.<br> - I wanna see Miss Etting.<br> - Sorry, I got orders.<br> You won't get in trouble.<br> I give you my guarantee.<br> Wait a minute. Hey, Taylor, come here.<br> I wanna see Ruth. Tell him it's okay.<br> She only has a couple of minutes<br> between numbers.<br> - Out of my way, punk!<br> - Marty, what is it? What's the matter?<br> I wanna see you.<br> Big shot thinks he can stop me.<br> If they don't want people backstage...<br> What are you trying to give me?<br> I've seen people come in.<br> You make exceptions. Everybody but me?<br> - You asked for it, you got it. Satisfied?<br> - You been riding me from the beginning.<br> - One more crack, I'll take you apart!<br> - Marty!<br> Go away. Go play cops and robbers<br> where they're scared.<br> This isn't Chicago.<br> Marty, stop it!<br> Marty! Marty, stop it!<br> Please stop it!<br> - All right, buster...<br> - Take it easy.<br> Throw him out! Ruth, come on.<br> It's your cue.<br> Call a doctor!<br> All right.<br> Ruth, get out there!<br> - Go on!<br> - Outside, buster, come on.<br> All right, buster, here we go.<br> Go on!<br> I don't care how you do it, Georgie!<br> Find a buyer and get rid of it.<br> Get all you can. I'm depending on you.<br> I'm pulling Ruth out of the show.<br> She's leaving Ziegfeld.<br> - I'm what?<br> - I'm fed up!<br> - Marty!<br> - I've had enough. It's up to here with me.<br> From now on, I'm number one.<br> You won't be the loser!<br> I've been on the phone.<br> I've got bookings for you.<br> Barney, we gotta get out<br> of that contract.<br> I'll have the dough. I'm selling the laundry.<br> But there might just be an angle.<br> Marty, we signed that contract<br> in good faith.<br> But there is an angle.<br> A good one.<br> You made us a nice little scandal tonight.<br> Fred's in the hospital<br> with a broken jaw.<br> He's lucky he's alive. So what?<br> - Ziegfeld doesn't want me if you're around.<br> - That don't hurt my feelings!<br> - He's a bigger jerk if he lets you go for free.<br> - Only I'm not going.<br> I was a hit tonight. A big hit.<br> It's a chance to be somebody.<br> It's the Follies. It's Broadway.<br> It's a chance to meet people<br> and to make friends.<br> It's what I've wanted, what I worked for.<br> Why should I leave it?<br> It's what I want,<br> the way it's gonna be!<br> - You can't tell me what to do!<br> - In a pig's eye, I can't!<br> - You think I'm Georgie? You own me?<br> - You're right, I own you. Exactly right!<br> Barney!<br> Good night, Ruth.<br> Good night, Marty.<br> I'm sorry I got angry.<br> We have a lot to talk about.<br> Let's not shout at each other.<br> Don't use your ritzy Ziegfeld voice on me.<br> - Make like you're in the 10-cent dance joint!<br> - But I'm not, Marty. That's the whole point!<br> - I'm where I wanna be.<br> - I ain't good enough.<br> - I didn't say that!<br> - Well, then, say it!<br> Have some guts. Say it!<br> All right! You don't belong here!<br> - It's the way you act!<br> - The way I've always acted!<br> I never heard you holler!<br> It's rotten, dirty, and I hate it!<br> You hate it?<br> You're talking to me, baby. Me!<br> Not Ziegfeld. I know you.<br> You were right there,<br> working me, begging for more.<br> Never mind how rotten or dirty!<br> Maybe I did, but I don't want<br> to go on that way.<br> - I knew tonight when...<br> - Tonight!<br> The minute we got here, this started.<br> The minute we got in that theater.<br> You saw the way they treated me.<br> Those fancy New York jokers.<br> Like I was nothing. Small potatoes.<br> Like I had no right.<br> I didn't say nothing. I waited.<br> Waited to see you butt in. And tell<br> them, "He's with me. We're together."<br> - I couldn't have.<br> - You could! You could!<br> I'd have done it for you.<br> But you never opened your trap.<br> Like you never owed me nothing.<br> You walked away.<br> You walked away!<br> Since the first day that I seen you,<br> I knocked my brains out for you.<br> But that's all right. That's all right.<br> I'm a poor slob.<br> I can pack a bag and go back to the laundry<br> and lay down and die. You don't care.<br> No skin off your back.<br> You got what you wanted.<br> I brought you this far. Nobody else.<br> I did.<br> But that don't count. Not with you.<br> Not with a high-class dame like you.<br> Marty, I know what I owe you.<br> I know it...<br> ...but there's no way to pay it.<br> Don't you see? There's no way to pay it.<br> Ain't there?<br> All right. You can go.<br> Let me. You got me around,<br> take advantage.<br> That's all right.<br> Why don't you sit down and relax.<br> Want a cup of coffee?<br> Yeah, that's what you need.<br> No, I don't want any, really. I'm fine.<br> I bet you can't guess<br> where we're going this afternoon.<br> That jewelry store on Fifth...<br> ...the one that doesn't have nothing in<br> the window except a string of pearls?<br> We're going over there<br> and pick up a little something for you.<br> How do you like that?<br> You don't have to buy me anything.<br> Who says I have to? I wanna.<br> Little token of how I feel.<br> - Don't worry about it so much.<br> - Who's worrying?<br> Everything's gonna be great.<br> The minute we get on that train. The<br> minute we get out of this phony town...<br> ...everything will be great. You'll see.<br> I'll do more for you<br> than a dozen Ziegfelds.<br> The tours I got worked out,<br> coast-to-coast.<br> Top spots everyplace.<br> What's so terrible about it?<br> The day will come when you'll thank me.<br> You'll laugh when you remember.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> I'm not complaining.<br> I'm just trying to tell you<br> that you don't have to work so hard.<br> You don't have to sell me.<br> I'm sold.<br> Just listen to this.<br> How was that, huh?<br> You can't top it anywhere.<br> - Thanks.<br> - How did it go?<br> Same as always.<br> Marty tell you where we're going<br> after we close?<br> Since when is it any of my business<br> where I work?<br> He just wants to surprise you, is all.<br> - He couldn't.<br> - Ruthie, are you there?<br> No, I'm playing a benefit in Duluth.<br> Leave it!<br> Everybody's so nervous<br> around here all the time.<br> I come in, I got great news,<br> a surprise.<br> But you gotta make cracks.<br> It's enough to take the heart<br> out of a person.<br> Never mind the dramatics.<br> What's the big news this time?<br> You're merely gonna make a picture<br> in Hollywood, that's all.<br> I merely kill myself for the past two weeks<br> setting the deal up for you, that's all.<br> And what a deal.<br> Between us, the things I told Barney Loomis<br> to ask for, I didn't dream we had a chance.<br> You should have heard Paul Hunter on the<br> phone. Long-distance. The studio head.<br> He acted like you was<br> the Queen of Sheba or something.<br> Well, how about it?<br> Itll be a change anyway.<br> - You glad at least?<br> - Sure, why not?<br> Mrs. Snyder...<br> ...could you just once, just once...<br> ...show some plain, common enthusiasm?<br> What do you want, a thank-you note?<br> You know something, Ruthie,<br> you ought to lay off that stuff.<br> You're getting to look like an old bag.<br> Hello.<br> - Miss Etting, please. Hollywood calling.<br> - This is Miss Etting.<br> Hollywood?<br> Operator, are you sure this call<br> isn't for Mr. Snyder?<br> - No, ma'am, Miss Ruth Etting.<br> - Well, this is she speaking.<br> - Hello, Ruth?<br> - Hello?<br> This is Johnny.<br> - Johnny?<br> - Johnny Alderman.<br> Johnny Alderman?<br> You can hang up. I don't know<br> how you feel about talking to me.<br> Oh, I feel fine about it, Johnny.<br> But I can't believe it.<br> What made you call after all this time?<br> Oh, I've wanted to call you often enough.<br> Only I didn't think I should.<br> Not after I heard you were married.<br> I heard you're coming<br> to do a picture for Paul Hunter.<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, I work here too, Ruth.<br> And what's more, I'm going to<br> be working with you.<br> - How do you like that?<br> - Johnny. You're making it up.<br> Ruthie, I just came in to tell you...<br> Who you talking to?<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know<br> what my future plans are.<br> I see.<br> I gather you don't wanna talk anymore.<br> Thank you. Thank you for calling.<br> It was one of the newspapers.<br> Well, why didn't they call me?<br> I handle the publicity.<br> Say, Ruthie, we're leaving<br> for the Coast on Sunday.<br> I picked a late train so that<br> you wouldn't have to rush getting up.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Itll do you good, Hollywood.<br> You'll enjoy it. It's good<br> for a person to change.<br> You and me been getting pretty<br> jumpy lately, you know.<br> I don't wanna go.<br> What?<br> It's just that I'm so tired.<br> I need a rest.<br> But I asked you<br> before I started the deal.<br> "Take a little vacation," I said.<br> "Lay off a while," I said.<br> But no. You wait until I get the deal<br> all sewed up hook, line and sinker.<br> Answer... Why?<br> Explain me, why?<br> It's just a feeling that I have.<br> Forget it.<br> I'm taking Mr. Snyder in<br> to see Mr. Hunter.<br> Oh, yes. Second corner to the right.<br> - Hello, Paul.<br> - Hello.<br> This is Mr. Snyder.<br> Mr. Hunter, Mr. Snyder.<br> Very nice to meet you, Mr. Snyder.<br> - But hasn't Miss Etting come with you?<br> - Mrs. Snyder just sings.<br> I'm the one does the talking.<br> I see.<br> Well, let's start with the story.<br> I'm sure you'll like it. I don't mind saying<br> we're all very proud of it.<br> - Where's the music? I don't see music.<br> - It comes separately. I have it here.<br> - What's he doing here?<br> - Mr. Alderman is the music director.<br> - I worked for Mr. Snyder and Miss Etting.<br> - Well, that makes everything friendly.<br> These are the numbers, Marty.<br> I've chosen...<br> You've chosen?<br> Nobody else got nothing to say?<br> They're subject to Ruth's approval.<br> She's no little chorus kid.<br> She knows what she's doing.<br> And when she don't,<br> believe you me, I do.<br> Of course, Mr. Snyder.<br> That's why we're happy<br> to have you both.<br> Now, why don't we all sit down<br> and talk things over.<br> - Look who's gone Hollywood.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey.<br> - Marty.<br> Come on, Georgie, come on.<br> Everybody come to California to lay around<br> in the sun, and she gotta sit in the house.<br> Hello, Ruth.<br> - Hello, Barney. Can I get you a drink?<br> - Thanks.<br> - Everything okay?<br> - Fine.<br> - Good.<br> - Of course, Mr. Hunter was disappointed...<br> ...that you weren't with us.<br> Say, you have a lot of meetings<br> tomorrow.<br> There's wardrobe and makeup<br> and publicity and...<br> - Well, Marty has the list.<br> - Yeah.<br> You start with the music director.<br> Wait till you hear who that is.<br> Johnny Alderman,<br> the piano player from Chicago.<br> Is that a laugh.<br> It's a small world, isn't it?<br> What's with you<br> and this fellow, Marty?<br> - He seemed to bother you at the conference.<br> - He don't bother me one bit.<br> He ain't important enough.<br> I just don't like him.<br> Something about his personality.<br> He always gave me a swift pain.<br> Why should he be on the picture?<br> Piano player like that,<br> we ought to have somebody good.<br> - He's making a name for himself.<br> - Let him make it on his own time.<br> How do you feel about it, Ruth?<br> I don't care one way or the other.<br> Whatever you say.<br> Well, we'll leave it lay<br> for the time being anyway.<br> - Hunter's a nice fellow, don't you think?<br> - A four-flusher, like the rest.<br> You know how long it took me<br> to get his number? A minute.<br> And I let him know it too.<br> Did you see his face when I said his last<br> three pictures were stinkeroos?<br> I really let him have it, didn't I?<br> That's the only way with phonies.<br> You gotta let them know who you are.<br> Who are you, Marty?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - What have you accomplished?<br> Can you produce a picture? Have you done<br> one successful thing on your own?<br> Just who do you think you are?<br> Pretty sharp, the little lady, huh?<br> Whoever I am, kiddo...<br> ...Im what makes you tick.<br> Don't you ever forget that.<br> Is it always like this, Ruth?<br> I'll make a deal with you, Barney.<br> You don't tell me your sad stories,<br> and I won't tell you mine.<br> How do you like it?<br> How do you like it?<br> Have I ever done one successful thing<br> on my own?<br> Listen, Marty.<br> I figure I get what she means.<br> Back in Chicago, you were a big man, see?<br> But since then, the people we do business<br> with, your name don't mean nothing.<br> After all, it ain't like it's up anywhere.<br> "Marty Snyder presents..."<br> Sure, you're married to her...<br> ...but for all they know you could be a guy<br> that's hanging on to a meal ticket.<br> You follow what I mean, Marty?<br> I'll show them.<br> I'll show them.<br> She'll see.<br> Well, get up!<br> What are you laying there for?<br> Barney. Come in here.<br> I wanna talk to you.<br> Barney, get free tomorrow.<br> All day. We got business.<br> And, Georgie, you take Ruth<br> to the studio instead of me.<br> And stick with her.<br> And if she wants to know<br> where I am, just tell her...<br> Tell her I'm too busy.<br> That's right. Tell her...<br> Tell her I'm just too busy.<br> Ruth.<br> - Hello, Johnny.<br> - Hello, Ruth.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - I'm sorry I'm late.<br> - Doesn't matter.<br> You know Georgie.<br> - Sure. How are you, Georgie?<br> - Fine.<br> Why don't you sit here<br> and make yourself comfortable.<br> We'll be in there, by the piano.<br> This way, Ruth.<br> Let's have a good look at you.<br> - A good look?<br> - A good look.<br> - Have I changed?<br> - Yes.<br> A lot's happened to you.<br> And it shows.<br> You're beautiful.<br> It's good to see you, Johnny.<br> And I'm awfully glad we're going<br> to make a picture together.<br> We always got along fine<br> when we worked.<br> And that's what we're here for,<br> isn't it? To work.<br> By all means. Let's get to work.<br> Have you looked over the songs?<br> You had some choice.<br> Doesn't make any difference.<br> Whatever you think.<br> - Shall we get started?<br> - All right.<br> I think you know this.<br> It's an old one of mine.<br> "I'll Never Stop Loving You."<br> Yes, I know it.<br> Yes, you still care about it.<br> Are you always this unhappy?<br> Or is it just today?<br> Is this going to be a long session, Johnny?<br> Because I have other appointments.<br> No.<br> No, all I'd planned for today<br> was to run through the songs.<br> Of course, I had thought you'd have lunch<br> with me afterwards. Or a drink.<br> Or a cup of coffee?<br> Or a cup of coffee.<br> The last time you asked me that,<br> Johnny, I didn't, because I didn't want to.<br> But now I'll tell you<br> so that you'll never ask me again.<br> I can't.<br> - Hello, Barney.<br> - Hello.<br> I'm tired, Marty. I didn't want<br> to go out tonight.<br> Relax. Don't be so sour.<br> Gotta eat someplace.<br> - I ordered your steak medium. Okay?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, how was it today?<br> - Fine.<br> How'd you get along<br> with that piano player?<br> I suppose he feels he's<br> a big shot now, huh?<br> Why shouldn't he?<br> He's doing pretty well.<br> Working for somebody else, ain't he?<br> Still punching a time clock.<br> - Who doesn't?<br> - Not everyone. Not everyone.<br> Go ahead and tell her.<br> Get it over with.<br> Garbage. Take it back.<br> - Tell the chef Mr. Snyder said, "steak."<br> - I'm sorry, sir.<br> There was nothing wrong<br> with that steak.<br> - Marty, you can't go on acting this way.<br> - Oh, yes, I can. Here I can.<br> I can act any way I want.<br> This is my place. I own it.<br> - How do you like that?<br> - You what?<br> It's his, all right. It's changed hands<br> - But it's his.<br> - Why do you want it?<br> I'll make it the hottest nightspot<br> on the Coast.<br> Oh, don't worry. None of your money's<br> in it. Not one red cent.<br> In two or three weeks when we open, you<br> can beg to buy in. You and old lady Loomis.<br> Two or three weeks? I'll be on this picture<br> for months. I can't play outside dates.<br> Did I ask you?<br> This joint, I make a success.<br> Don't blame me. I told him<br> it was no cinch, this business.<br> I know it like the back of me hand.<br> Been around the clubs for 14 years.<br> Do you think I washed socks<br> when I was running laundry?<br> - Look it's one thing...<br> - You want them thinking I'm brainless?<br> You want they should think<br> I'm getting handouts from you?<br> So busy making you something,<br> they think I'm nothing.<br> You put it all in, Marty?<br> The dough from the laundry?<br> You getting scared too?<br> Here's what I'm gonna do.<br> First, I close down the place.<br> Then I throw out everything.<br> Everything. Every stick.<br> I'm starting from scratch.<br> When I get through, its own mother<br> won't know this joint.<br> And it's gonna look rich,<br> like it costs. Only in good taste.<br> Like you're always screaming.<br> Nothing loud.<br> And the entertainment?<br> Only headliners. Personalities.<br> Am I bending your ear too much, Ruthie?<br> If I am, I'll shut up.<br> But I'm all steamed up<br> about this thing, you know?<br> - What did you do that for?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'm just so nervous.<br> You know, the rehearsals and everything<br> starting tomorrow.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, that's what it is. Sure.<br> You're bound to be.<br> I need a good night's rest.<br> Yeah, you're right.<br> I'll...<br> I'll hit the hay in the other room.<br> You go on. Go to bed.<br> Good night.<br> Good luck with the club, Marty.<br> Don't say it like you're a stranger.<br> Hey, Marty.<br> Here's the layout, Mr. Snyder.<br> Here. Here, look. In the middle, "M.S."<br> With a wreath, you know?<br> - And green and gold.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> How do you like that<br> for a name, Barney?<br> - M.S. Club? M.S., Marty Snyder. Get it?<br> - Yeah, I got it. Now look, Marty.<br> I still think you're mistaken<br> about Frankie Desirio and his orchestra.<br> - They're gonna cost you a fortune.<br> - Book them. Don't give me no headaches.<br> - You the waiters?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Okay, don't get excited. Wait.<br> All right, come on, girls.<br> Come on.<br> Oh, come on, get them up.<br> All right. You, you and you.<br> The rest of you can blow.<br> Now, you three. Remember something.<br> This is legit. You're only selling cigarettes.<br> Back tomorrow morning at 10<br> for a fitting.<br> - Barney, you get over to the studio?<br> - Sure.<br> - See Ruth?<br> - Yeah.<br> She's coming over for dinner.<br> You know, we been so busy lately,<br> we hardly seen each other.<br> - How was she? In a good mood?<br> - Sure. This picture's a real shot in the arm.<br> - Never saw such a change in a girl.<br> - She listen to me, she don't go wrong.<br> Hi, Marty.<br> - Where's Ruth?<br> - She had to work again.<br> She didn't have no call tonight.<br> What are they pulling?<br> This happens all the time.<br> They find out that a recording stage<br> is free or something. It's just routine.<br> Yeah, sure. Sure, Barney.<br> I know you're anxious to get home.<br> I won't need you.<br> - Okay, good night.<br> - Good night, Barney.<br> How do they act together?<br> Ruthie and the piano player?<br> I watch, just like you told me.<br> There's nothing to watch.<br> She's more friendly with others than him.<br> The wardrobe girl, the makeup man.<br> An old geezer. A grip, they call him.<br> Him, she's always talking to.<br> But Johnny, nothing.<br> Okay?<br> All right.<br> You dumb jerk.<br> I could have sung all night, Johnny.<br> - It was a good session, wasn't it?<br> - You were great, and you know it.<br> Thank you.<br> - I am helped by the score and conductor.<br> - Thank you.<br> You're doing a wonderful job.<br> I know. I can't understand it.<br> I'm usually not this good.<br> Good night, Johnny.<br> - Hello, Ruth.<br> - Hello, Mr. Hunter.<br> - Done for tonight?<br> - Just finished.<br> I've heard the recordings.<br> They're beautiful.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Just beautiful.<br> I'm delighted.<br> Ruth...<br> ...Mr. Snyder just dropped in. Tells me<br> you're dissatisfied with Johnny Alderman?<br> - Oh, I'm not.<br> - That you want him off the picture.<br> - That's not true.<br> - He said that either Johnny goes or you go.<br> I can't fire a man for no reason, Ruth.<br> I'll be here in the morning, Mr. Hunter.<br> Don't worry, there won't be any problems.<br> - Good.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night, Ruth.<br> You said you would finish tonight.<br> And that's the way it's gonna be. I don't<br> care if it is double time. Get it done.<br> Why did you lie to Hunter?<br> - All in an uproar, huh?<br> - He's staying on the picture, Marty.<br> Fine. Fine. Then they're pulling you off.<br> - Hey...<br> - Have you gone crazy?<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> What have you got against him?<br> What has he done to you? Why?<br> You're going off, and that's that.<br> Marty, listen to me, please.<br> This is important.<br> Don't do this.<br> Don't spoil this picture.<br> It's the first thing I've cared about<br> since New York. I don't wanna lose it.<br> I have to work. Do you understand?<br> - I've got to. It's all I've got.<br> - Shut up. You'll work. Who said different?<br> Only where I can keep an eye on you<br> so you don't get ideas. Get so big.<br> You're gonna work here. Open this joint.<br> And there's gonna be a sign:<br> "Martin Snyder presents Ruth Etting."<br> That way everybody<br> will know who's boss.<br> Like you know. Like you better know.<br> No matter how much you scream<br> and holler and carry on.<br> What's the matter, Marty?<br> Are you afraid you're losing your grip?<br> You come back here.<br> What are you gaping at? Get to work.<br> Ruthie.<br> Get the car.<br> Ruthie.<br> Ruthie.<br> Ruthie.<br> No, she's not here.<br> What's the matter, Marty?<br> Did she run away?<br> Keep away from her.<br> - Lf I catch you around her, I'll kill you.<br> - She has to walk out on you herself.<br> If she ever gets the guts to do it,<br> I will be hanging around.<br> I'm just telling you<br> so you'll know where to find me.<br> - Where now, Marty?<br> - Home.<br> I'm gonna get my rest.<br> She's the one putting on the big act?<br> Let her be the one that don't sleep.<br> You say there's nobody registered there<br> that looks like that?<br> Are you sure?<br> Well, what time did you come on duty?<br> All right, all right.<br> Keep your shirt on.<br> Marty, why don't you lay down a while.<br> She's gotta be someplace.<br> What's she doing this for?<br> Hello? Hello, Ruthie. What...?<br> What did you say, miss?<br> All right.<br> I'll be there.<br> Barney's office.<br> She wants to meet me there in an hour.<br> Marty, why don't you take a shower.<br> I guarantee you'll feel better.<br> You know you always feel better<br> after a shower.<br> Why, you got a lot of time.<br> Where you been? Why a meeting?<br> - Why here?<br> - Sit down.<br> If we got something to straighten out,<br> it's between us. Why drag Barney into it?<br> - Because he's a good friend to both of us.<br> - So?<br> You can have anything you want,<br> any settlement.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I want a divorce.<br> - What?<br> - We've got to put an end to this.<br> What do you mean? How can you<br> put an end to a thing like this?<br> We have to. It isn't worth living<br> this way. It hasn't been.<br> - You think you can just tell me...?<br> - I can't anymore, Marty.<br> Look, Marty, she can't help<br> the way she feels.<br> What a way to wind it up.<br> A girl, a secretary, calls you on a phone<br> and tells you you've got an appointment.<br> I've tried. You know I've tried,<br> but I can't go on any longer.<br> What's the use if we're both miserable?<br> - It's that guy, ain't it?<br> - No!<br> - Yeah.<br> - No!<br> Yeah, I was on the stage last night.<br> I seen your face when you looked at him.<br> Right from the start.<br> - You been two-timing me!<br> - That's not true!<br> - Marty!<br> - It is true! It is true!<br> - It's been him all the time, ain't it?<br> - No, it's you! It's you!<br> It's because of you!<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> You wanna call it a day.<br> Fine.<br> Get a lawyer. Get it started.<br> Anything you say.<br> Anything to make you happy.<br> I did an awful lot for that girl.<br> She don't realize.<br> - Isn't that right?<br> - That's right.<br> You can level with the both of us.<br> - Didn't I do wonders for her?<br> - Yes.<br> - The contracts I got her.<br> - Yes, Marty.<br> I couldn't handle all the people<br> with kidgloves.<br> But it's push or get pushed.<br> See what I mean, Barney?<br> Sure, I understand. Now, Marty,<br> go home and get some rest.<br> We'll talk later. You're all keyed up.<br> Well, maybe this is the best thing<br> that could happen.<br> I mean that serious.<br> Let her see how she gets along<br> without me. If she does, fine.<br> You won't hear one squawk out of me.<br> But she'll come running back so fast,<br> believe me, it won't even be funny.<br> Well, I gotta go.<br> I got things to do.<br> Thanks, Barney.<br> - What did she want?<br> - Nothing. You know how they are.<br> - They get notions.<br> - Splitting up?<br> Splitting up? That's crazy.<br> She'd be lost without me.<br> Sure. It figures.<br> - Where we going now?<br> - To the club, where else?<br> You think I'm gonna let things fall<br> apart just because she gets a notion?<br> You're funny, no kidding.<br> Look at you. The puss on you.<br> You're tired, Georgie. I've been taking<br> advantage, running your feet off.<br> No, I ain't tired.<br> You know, what most people<br> don't appreciate...<br> ...it's a tough business, show business. You<br> gotta have somebody tough on your side.<br> She'll come running back.<br> It's a foregone thing.<br> That's what it is, a forgone thing.<br> A little faster. Roll them.<br> - Speed.<br> - Playback.<br> All right, cut. Cut.<br> - Hold it.<br> - Playback.<br> Step down, Ruth. We have some<br> mechanical difficulty. Help her down, Tony.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Very nice.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Joe.<br> Ruth. Are you all right?<br> He came to my place looking for you.<br> What happened?<br> - Johnny, it has nothing to do with you.<br> - Have you left him, Ruth?<br> Please, it isn't any of your business.<br> That's a lie. He knows it if you don't.<br> - Have you left him?<br> - Yes, I've left him...<br> ...but it doesn't make any difference.<br> You've got to stay away from me, please.<br> - Did you see her?<br> - They wouldn't let me in.<br> She's there. They've been<br> shooting two days.<br> What's the matter?<br> Why'd you let them bluff you?<br> - Why didn't you barge in through the gate?<br> - I did, Marty. They threw me out.<br> You know what? I ran into Barney Loomis<br> over at the studio.<br> The musicians union, unless you<br> get dough, won't let the band open.<br> - He's gotta talk to you.<br> - He'll talk to me when I talk to him later.<br> - Everybody telling me what to do.<br> - Marty, listen.<br> We've been pals a long time.<br> Since we were kids practically, huh?<br> It ain't Ruth's fault. It's him.<br> That piano player.<br> He's got an influence on her.<br> If it's him or it ain't, what's the difference?<br> It's all done. Can't you forget about her?<br> We got a club to open here<br> in three days.<br> All the dough you got in the world<br> is tied up in this joint.<br> Marty, I tell you the truth, I worry.<br> That's bunk. I'll take care of you.<br> Didn't I always?<br> - Yeah, only...<br> - Only what?!<br> Mr. Snyder, you wanna look at these initials<br> on the drapes before I hang them?<br> You're paid to put them up!<br> Don't ask me so much!<br> - He's in his office, Barney, if you wanna...<br> - Later, I said. Later! Let me alone, will you?<br> Get away! Like flies, like leeches!<br> My own place, they can't let me alone.<br> Sure, I can forget her. Yeah.<br> People die. People go away.<br> Once it's finished, you don't go around<br> knocking yourself against a stone wall.<br> Once it's finished.<br> Johnny.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Where have you been the last few days?<br> You said you didn't want to see me.<br> Well, I know I did, but...<br> Well, I didn't think you'd stop coming<br> to the set.<br> I mean, with so many people around<br> and everything.<br> There's no harm in that, is there?<br> There's not much point either.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - This car for you?<br> - Yes.<br> Cancel it. Let me drive you home.<br> - No, Johnny.<br> - I just talked with Barney Loomis.<br> Marty's taking this a lot better<br> than you are.<br> Now, wait a minute, let me finish.<br> I'm not asking you to change your mind<br> about anything.<br> All I'm asking, let me drive you home.<br> But I can't. I can't take the chance.<br> - Well, good night.<br> - Please, Johnny.<br> For what it's worth...<br> ...I love you.<br> - Good night, Miss Etting.<br> - Good night.<br> - Johnny, what are you doing here?<br> - Oh, darling.<br> After what you said back there...<br> Good night.<br> Good night, darling.<br> Johnny!<br> Johnny!<br> He had it coming to him.<br> I told him. I told him I was gonna<br> let him have it.<br> I couldn't back down,<br> you know what I mean, Ruthie?<br> You've been up all night.<br> And you're all right.<br> No matter how you feel.<br> I feel tired.<br> Exactly as if I was shot.<br> But if...<br> If you tell me you love me,<br> I'll go to sleep.<br> I love you.<br> I'll be telling you<br> for the rest of my life.<br> You'll get awfully tired hearing it.<br> You wanna bet?<br> How is he?<br> Ruth, there are still some<br> photographers downstairs.<br> - Can you take it?<br> - Yes.<br> Barney, what's gonna happen with Marty?<br> Well, he'll probably get out on bail.<br> Then he'll have to stand trial.<br> - But what about his club?<br> - Oh, it won't open. It can't.<br> Why, it was touch-and-go<br> about the money anyway.<br> Now, after this, why,<br> it's not a chance he can get it.<br> Now, don't you start<br> feeling sorry for him.<br> - Aren't you?<br> - Oh, yes, I am.<br> I'd help him if I could, but I can't.<br> Nobody can.<br> And you're the one person in the world<br> who mustn't even try.<br> - Why not?<br> - There are 1000...<br> Barney, he gave me a big chunk<br> of his life.<br> It doesn't matter that I didn't want it.<br> But the point is, he gave it and I took it.<br> I can't walk away when he's in trouble<br> as if it weren't my business.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Too much of it is my fault.<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> - I mean it.<br> Barney, I didn't leave him<br> with anything.<br> With any pride, self-respect, nothing.<br> I've got to see him.<br> Barney, you have to fix it for me.<br> Please.<br> Please.<br> You're making a big mistake.<br> I've made so many, one more<br> won't make any difference.<br> - Sit down, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> Martin Snyder.<br> Something on your mind?<br> I don't know if they've told you or not,<br> but he's going to be all right.<br> - That should make it easier for you.<br> - I ain't worried.<br> Had to learn him a lesson, and I did.<br> I guess he thought I was bluffing.<br> Well, a whole lot of people<br> had me all wrong.<br> But I guess they're all wised up now.<br> I never been the kind of guy<br> lets nobody double-cross him.<br> No one double-crossed you, Marty.<br> I've never said one word to Johnny<br> that you couldn't have heard.<br> Just good pals, huh?<br> No. Not anymore.<br> I love him.<br> And I'm going to marry him.<br> Is that what you come to tell me?<br> Okay, you told me.<br> Please, Marty. There is something else.<br> That day, in Barney's office,<br> we were both so upset...<br> ...that I couldn't really say<br> what I wanted to.<br> You did just fine. You said plenty.<br> But I didn't get to say thank you<br> for all the nice things.<br> For all the good things<br> that you've done for me.<br> Who are you kidding, Ruthie?<br> Who are you trying to butter up?<br> What's the matter, kiddo, scared?<br> Afraid I'll take another shot<br> at your boyfriend?<br> - Marty, please, listen to me.<br> - No, you listen to me.<br> I'll be sprung. I'll get out of here.<br> And I'll beat this rap.<br> You think I'm through?<br> You don't know me.<br> There's one thing I am through with:<br> You.<br> You ain't got a thing to worry about.<br> I don't want no part of you.<br> What are you sitting there<br> like a wooden Indian? Beat it.<br> Go on back to your piano player.<br> He can have you.<br> Tell him you seen me in the pokey<br> and I look great.<br> Tell him I like it.<br> Makes me feel like I'm a kid again.<br> Well, you ain't told me yet<br> who put up the bail.<br> All of a sudden, you're such a clam.<br> I didn't have a chance with<br> those reporters and everything.<br> Barney Loomis. He put it up for you.<br> He's such a pal, why didn't he<br> come with you?<br> - I don't know, Marty. Maybe he was busy.<br> - Yeah.<br> Word goes out a guy's broke,<br> everybody gets busy.<br> - He put the dough up, didn't he?<br> - He'll get it back.<br> Yeah, but he put it up.<br> Yeah, he ain't such a bad guy.<br> Hey, this ain't the way home.<br> Thought maybe we'd drop by<br> the club for a minute.<br> What do I wanna give myself<br> the blues for?<br> - Couple of things you ought to look at.<br> - Forget it. I wanna get a shower.<br> They don't keep things so dainty<br> in that clink. Go on home.<br> Yeah, Marty, just a minute.<br> Georgie.<br> - I'll throw her out!<br> - Marty. Stop, please!<br> - Marty!<br> - Let go of me! Let go!<br> There are reporters in there.<br> I don't care who's there. I'll pull her<br> off the bandstand.<br> I don't need nobody.<br> I don't need handouts.<br> Listen to me! This is not a handout.<br> You did a lot for Ruth in the old days.<br> She knows, she's grateful.<br> She's got a right to pay it back.<br> And you've got to take it.<br> You've got to be big enough to take it.<br> Hey, that's the guy that shot the guy!<br> - Look this way, Mr. Snyder!<br> - Over here.<br> Hey, give me your autograph, mister.<br> - You have a good thing on your hands.<br> - Yeah, sure. Sure.<br> - You mean the club?<br> - Yeah. Take a look at it.<br> It's packed. Never been<br> more than four people in here.<br> Yeah, I guess you're right.<br> Mr. Snyder, can I get<br> some backstage shots?<br> Mr. Loomis said that you're the only one<br> that can okay it.<br> Yeah, sure. Sure, why not?<br> Only not during the floor show.<br> That's one of my rules.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Think nothing of it.<br> - What'd you do to the place?<br> - Pretty nifty.<br> - Who'd you get in? Decorators?<br> - I got myself in, that's who.<br> - Think you've broken the jinx on this spot?<br> - There was never no jinx on this spot.<br> - Just of lot of jerks running it.<br> - Got big plans for it?<br> When I get through, you'll need<br> a reservation a month in advance.<br> - You're counting on keeping it running?<br> - Through thick and thin.<br> No matter what happens at my trial.<br> That's just in case you're being<br> too polite to ask.<br> Mr. Snyder, does Miss Etting's appearance<br> here tonight...<br> ...mean you two are getting back together?<br> - No.<br> Ms. Etting is just fulfilling<br> a contractual obligation.<br> You got that? A contractual obligation.<br> She's gonna be paid like any other artist.<br> Kind of surprising, in view<br> of what's happened.<br> What's surprising about it?<br> Business is business.<br> Put down that I've got the greatest<br> respect for Miss Etting as an artist.<br> Boys, step up to the bar<br> and have a drink.<br> And, Georgie, see to it my pals<br> get everything they want.<br> Check your hats, please.<br> Good evening, Mr. Snyder.<br> You gotta give her credit.<br> The girl can sing.<br> About that, I never was wrong.<br>
