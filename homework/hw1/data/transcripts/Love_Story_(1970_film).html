I haven't exactly<br> decided on the law school.<br> I was merely asking whether<br> the law school had decided on you.<br> - No, sir.<br> - There really isn't any doubt.<br> About what, sir?<br> The law school needs good men like you.<br> - They haven't got a hockey team.<br> - You have other qualities, Oliver.<br> I'm sorry you had to come<br> all the way up here to see Harvard lose.<br> I came to see you play.<br> You know, Oliver, the dean<br> of the law school is an old classmate...<br> That's very nice, sir.<br> - Well, good-bye.<br> - Good-bye, sir.<br> - Give my best to mother.<br> - Yes, I will.<br> Briggs Hall.

Does he wear a mask?<br> - In a way.<br> - Come on, he must be proud as hell.<br> - Here you are, this big Harvard jock.<br> - So was he.<br> Bigger than All-Ivy?<br> He rowed single sculls<br> in the 1928 Olympics.<br> - Oh. Did he win?<br> - No.<br> Then why is he a son of a bitch?<br> Because he leans on me.<br> Because he makes me do the right things.<br> What's wrong with<br> doing the right things?<br> I don't like to be programmed<br> in the Barrett tradition.<br> I don't like to have to put out<br> "X" amount of achievement every term.<br> Yeah, I've noticed you hate<br> making dean's list and being All-Ivy.<br> What I hate is that he expects no less,<br> and when I do come through,<br> He's so incredibly<br> blas and indifferent.<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> - You know all he said after the game?<br> He went all the way up<br> to Ithaca to watch you play hockey?<br> After we blew the title<br> and after I was nearly massacred<br> by the wild Canadian hordes,<br> do you know what the big banker<br> Harvard man said to his son?<br> Hordes in Ithaca?<br> "You know, Oliver, the dean of<br> the law school was a classmate of mine."<br> What did you expect him to say?<br> "How's your sex life?"<br> - Whose side are you on, Jenny?<br> - I didn't know it was a war.<br> You don't understand.<br> Oh, I think I understand<br> quite a bit more than you wish I did.<br> Did your father...<br> Excuse me...<br> Did the son of a bitch<br> at least get lousy grades?<br> - He was a Rhodes Scholar.<br> - I think I notice a little problem<br> of overachievement<br> in the Barrett family.<br> Listen. let's forget about it.<br> There's no problem, OK?<br> - Right. No problem.<br> - Hey, do I call my father on the phone?<br> Do I bill and coo and say,<br> "I love you, Phil?"<br> - No.<br> - There you are.<br> - And do you know why?<br> - Why?<br> Because his name is Oliver.<br> The great Barrett Hall. Don't you<br> at least salute when you pass it?<br> Ugliest building on campus.<br> Do you know I've never even been inside?<br> Now, that's a very mature attitude.<br> It's not easy to live with history<br> staring you in the face.<br> How many people do you know<br> have to cope with a Barrett Hall?<br> - Well, I could name two.<br> - Thanks.<br> Cavalleri, I've got<br> nothing against music,<br> but must you play it while we study?<br> I'm studying the music, preppie.<br> It's called Analysis of Form.<br> Yeah.<br> You're going to flunk out if you<br> just sit there watching me study.<br> I'm not watching you study.<br> I'm studying.<br> Bullshit. You're looking at my legs.<br> Listen, Cavalleri,<br> you're not that great-looking.<br> I know, but can I help it<br> if you think so?<br> Let's change the subject, huh?<br> I wasn't aware that<br> there was a subject.<br> You're under the mistaken impression<br> that I wanted to make love to you.<br> - Was I?<br> - But I'm not interested.<br> Definitely. Not interested.<br> Good. At least we've got<br> one thing in common.<br> Look, Cavalleri, I know your game,<br> and I'm tired of playing it.<br> You are the supreme Radcliffe smart-ass.<br> The best.<br> You put down anything in pants.<br> But verbal volleyball<br> is not my idea of a relationship.<br> And if that's what<br> you think it's all about,<br> why don't you just go back to<br> your music wonks, and good luck.<br> See, I think you're scared.<br> You put up a big, glass wall<br> to keep from getting hurt,<br> but it also keeps you<br> from getting touched.<br> It's a risk, isn't it, Jenny?<br> At least I had the guts<br> to admit what I felt.<br> Someday, you're gonna have to come up<br> with the courage to admit you care.<br> I care.<br> Do you think your priest<br> would like this?<br> I don't have one.<br> Aren't you a good Catholic girl?<br> Well, I'm a girl...<br> And I'm good, right?<br> So, that's two out of three.<br> - Why do you wear it?<br> - It was my mother's.<br> - Why'd you leave?<br> - What?<br> Why'd you leave the Church?<br> I don't know.<br> I never really joined.<br> I mean, I guess I never thought<br> there was another world<br> better than this one.<br> I mean, what could be<br> better than Mozart...<br> Or Bach...<br> Or you?<br> Jenny?<br> I'm up there with Bach and Mozart?<br> And The Beatles.<br> Hey, Simpson, let me<br> sack on your couch.<br> - How come?<br> - Barrett.<br> - Who's the guest of honor?<br> - Cavalleri.<br> Again? Still?<br> Barrett's slipping.<br> It's amazing.<br> I'm studying.<br> I'm really studying.<br> I'm studying.<br> Sorry. Sorry.<br> Oliver?<br> I love you.<br> I can't believe<br> how great you were.<br> Yeah, that tells me how much<br> you know about music.<br> I know enough.<br> Wise up, would you please, Barrett?<br> I was not great. I was not even All-Ivy.<br> I was just OK, OK?<br> OK.<br> But I mean, you should<br> always keep at it.<br> Who said I'm not gonna<br> keep at it, for God's sake?<br> I'm going to study<br> with Nadia Boulanger, aren't I?<br> Who?<br> Next year.<br> I have a scholarship in Paris.<br> Paris?<br> Yeah. I've never been to Europe.<br> I can hardly wait.<br> Hey. How long have you<br> known about this?<br> Come on, Ollie, don't be stupid,<br> would you please? It's inevitable.<br> What is?<br> That we're gonna graduate<br> and go our separate ways,<br> and that you're going<br> to go on to law school.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You're a preppie millionaire,<br> and I'm a social zero.<br> What does that have to do<br> with going our separate ways?<br> We're together now, aren't we?<br> We're happy.<br> Look, Harvard is like this big Santa<br> Claus bag stuffed full of crazy toys,<br> - but when the holiday's over...<br> - This has been more than a holiday.<br> You've got to go back<br> where you belong.<br> You're going back to Cranston,<br> Rhode Island, to bake cookies?<br> Pastries! And don't<br> make fun of my father.<br> Then don't leave me, Jenny!<br> Please.<br> Yeah, but what about my scholarship,<br> and what about Paris,<br> that I've never seen<br> in my whole goddamn life?<br> And what about our marriage?<br> Who said anything about marriage?<br> I'm saying it now.<br> You want to marry me?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Why?<br> Because.<br> That's a good reason.<br> - You're driving like a maniac.<br> - This is Boston.<br> Everybody drives like a maniac.<br> You're gonna kill us<br> before your parents can murder us.<br> Jenny, my parents<br> are gonna fall in love with you.<br> - Even the son of a bitch?<br> - Of course. Absolutely.<br> Hey, where's the old<br> Radcliffe confidence?<br> - Back at Radcliffe.<br> - It's going to be OK, Jenny.<br> - What did you say on the phone?<br> - Just that I'd drop in to visit.<br> - Very casual, huh?<br> - Yeah, right.<br> How often do you visit<br> during the term?<br> - Never.<br> - Oh, that's casual.<br> Holy shit!<br> Hey, stop, Oliver.<br> No kidding. Stop the car.<br> I didn't think<br> it would be like this.<br> - Like what?<br> - I mean, like, this rich.<br> This is too much for me.<br> Don't worry, Jenny. It'll be a breeze.<br> Yeah, but why is it that<br> I suddenly wish my name<br> were Abigail Adams<br> or Wendy Wasp?<br> - Don't be scared.<br> - Aren't you?<br> No.<br> - So far, so good.<br> - That's not saying much.<br> - Your hand is cold.<br> - So is yours.<br> Let's get away from here<br> while we still got a chance.<br> Master Oliver! Hello!<br> Hello, Florence. This is Jenny.<br> Master? I always knew you had slaves.<br> Let me take your wrap.<br> Your parents are in the drawing room.<br> Thank you, Florence.<br> Wow, I see half the buildings<br> of Harvard hanging on that wall.<br> Oh, it's nothing.<br> Hey, you didn't tell me you were<br> related to the Sewell Boathouse.<br> Yes, I come from a long line<br> of wood and stone.<br> Hello there!<br> I'd like you to meet<br> Jennifer Calaveri.<br> - Cavalleri.<br> - As in Cavalleria Rusticana?<br> - Right. No relation.<br> - Hello, Mom.<br> Hello, darling.<br> So nice to meet you.<br> How are you, son?<br> Fine. Fine, sir. Fine.<br> Please sit down<br> and make yourself at home.<br> We'll have to be going soon.<br> Why are you so uncomfortable<br> with your parents?<br> What gave you that impression?<br> Why did you want to leave<br> the minute we got there?<br> Because I didn't like the way<br> they were treating you.<br> Like what?<br> "What is it your parents<br> are in, Jennifer?"<br> What is it your people<br> are in, Jennifer?<br> My father bakes cookies.<br> - Oh? What's the name of his firm?<br> - Phil's Bake Shop.<br> - Of Cranston, Rhode Island.<br> - How interesting.<br> So your people come<br> from Cranston, Jenny.<br> Well, mostly. Actually, my mother<br> came from Fall River.<br> The Barretts have mills in Fall River.<br> Where they exploited<br> the New England poor for generations.<br> - In the 19th century.<br> - When you inherit, Oliver,<br> you can give all our money<br> back as reparations.<br> Well, that's exactly what the<br> philosopher, Saint-Simon advocated.<br> In the 18th century.<br> - It's getting late.<br> - For what?<br> But you're staying<br> for dinner, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - No. I've got to get back.<br> Nonsense. You're staying<br> for dinner, and that's an order.<br> Everything is an order,<br> a directive, a command.<br> Where is your sense of humor?<br> You know, when I was in school,<br> he used to send me memos. Memos!<br> I mean, don't you find that rather odd?<br> I find it rather cute.<br> Tell me, Oliver,<br> have you heard from law school?<br> No, sir, not yet.<br> He'll get in. Who've they got<br> better than Oliver?<br> I quite agree. He's bound<br> to be graduated with honors.<br> Oliver has always<br> done well in school.<br> Even at Exeter, he was the very...<br> Mother, it doesn't mean a thing.<br> There are a lot of guys trying<br> to get into law school.<br> I just happen to be one of them.<br> - I could give Price Zimmerman a ring...<br> - No!<br> I mean, please don't, sir.<br> Merely to find out if he knows.<br> I want to get my letter<br> with everyone else, please.<br> He was only trying to be helpful.<br> But, Jenny,<br> I don't need that kind of help.<br> - OK.<br> - No, it's not OK!<br> He's not going to be satisfied<br> till he cuts them off.<br> What?<br> What you wouldn't like<br> to be cut off.<br> Oh... Well, we've got<br> to take care of those.<br> - Take care, you two!<br> - Drive with caution, Oliver.<br> Get there a minute later,<br> but get there.<br> You really like<br> to bug your father, don't you?<br> The feeling's mutual,<br> or haven't you noticed?<br> I mean, I didn't think you'd stop at<br> anything just to get to your old man.<br> It's impossible to get<br> to Oliver Barrett III.<br> Unless maybe...<br> if you marry Jennifer Cavalleri?<br> - Is that what you think?<br> - Yes, I think it's part of it.<br> Jenny, you don't believe I love you?<br> Yes, but in a crazy sort of way,<br> I think you also love<br> - my negative social status.<br> - No!<br> Listen, I can't pass judgment, Oliver.<br> I just think so.<br> I mean... I know<br> that I love not only you,<br> but your name and your numeral.<br> After all, it's part of what you are.<br> - Oh, how can you do it?<br> - What?<br> How can you see me and still love me?<br> That's what it's about, preppie.<br> - How are you, son?<br> - Oh, I'm OK. OK, sir.<br> - Did you hear from law school?<br> - Yes. I called you, remember?<br> Oh, yes, yes. Congratulations.<br> You'll be the first Barrett<br> on the Supreme Court.<br> Oh, I may just chase<br> ambulances instead.<br> Yes, fine. How's Raymond?<br> He's fine. Got into OCS.<br> Army?<br> - That's good.<br> - That's bad.<br> - You haven't mentioned Jennifer.<br> - What's there to say?<br> You're presenting us<br> with a fait accompli, are you not?<br> - But what did you think?<br> - I think she's absolutely charming,<br> And I think for a girl<br> from her background<br> - to get all the way to Radcliffe is...<br> - Get to the point.<br> The point doesn't concern<br> the young lady. It concerns you.<br> Your rebellion.<br> - And you are rebelling, Oliver.<br> - I fail...<br> I fail to see how marrying<br> a beautiful and brilliant<br> Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.<br> I mean, she's not<br> some crazy hippie.<br> She's not many things.<br> What irks you most, Father?<br> That she's Catholic or that she's poor?<br> - What attracts you most?<br> - I'm leaving.<br> Don't go off half-cocked, damn it!<br> I would only ask that you...<br> wait a bit.<br> - Define "bit."<br> - Finish law school.<br> If this thing is real,<br> it will stand the test of time.<br> It is real, but I don't see why<br> I have to put it to some arbitrary test.<br> - Because I'm asking you to.<br> - You're commanding me!<br> Oliver, if you marry her now,<br> I'll not give you the time of day.<br> Father, you don't know the time of day.<br> We're... looking forward<br> to having you with us next year.<br> Me, too, Dean Thompson.<br> Something's come up.<br> - Not a change of heart, I hope.<br> - No, I'm still set on law school,<br> But... I'm going to need<br> a scholarship.<br> - Really?<br> - That's why I'm here.<br> That's... Well, that's rather curious,<br> considering your background.<br> - I'm not his son anymore.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> We have had a...<br> a misunderstanding.<br> It's a parting of the ways.<br> This is...<br> very unfortunate, Mr. Barrett.<br> I am not exactly jumping for joy.<br> Yet... we have many entering students<br> in far worse straits than you.<br> What's worse than<br> the straits of destitution?<br> Dean Thompson,<br> I'm getting married next month.<br> Now, we're both going<br> to work all summer,<br> and then Jenny's going to take<br> a job in a private school, teaching.<br> That's a living, but it's not tuition.<br> Your tuition is pretty steep.<br> Yes.<br> Dean Thompson, I need a scholarship.<br> Now, I'm a Harvard magna,<br> and I've already been accepted.<br> - I don't have any money in the bank.<br> - You have a millionaire father.<br> Had, dean, had.<br> Why should I be penalized because<br> I was once related to a rich man?<br> Mr. Barrett, I really<br> don't think that this office<br> should enter into a...<br> family quarrel?<br> A rather distressing one, at that.<br> I see. Thank you.<br> Perhaps... at midyear...<br> Thank you. You've been<br> very generous with your time.<br> We just passed<br> my junior high school!<br> Jenny, I can't believe<br> he liked my instant poverty.<br> He did, I swear. I mean, at least now<br> you've got something in common.<br> God, when I first<br> told him Oliver Barrett...<br> Yeah? Yeah?<br> I mean, he just couldn't believe it.<br> He kept reminding me<br> of the 11th Commandment.<br> - Eleventh?<br> - "Do not bullshit thy father."<br> Any other commandments<br> I ought to know about?<br> Yeah. "Stay loose."<br> - So, is he for it? Does he approve?<br> - What do you think?<br> I won't allow it!<br> I will not allow it!<br> - Do you get me?<br> - You're tilting at windmills, Phil!<br> Will you stop referring<br> to his father as a windmill?<br> He's a distinguished citizen of Boston,<br> who I'm gonna call up...<br> - Mr. Cavalleri...<br> - Phil. My name is Phil.<br> I'm gonna call his goddamn father.<br> I'll go to Boston, even!<br> It's not gonna do any good, goddamn it!<br> Would you please not use<br> profanity in this house, Jennifer?<br> - You do.<br> - What the hell is he gonna think?<br> He's gonna think<br> you've lost your marbles.<br> Why, because I won't allow<br> a parent to reject a child?<br> - Mr. Cavalleri...<br> - Phil.<br> - Phil.<br> - Phil, sir... I reject him, too.<br> Now, don't talk like that, Oliver.<br> A father's love is something<br> to cherish and respect.<br> - It's a rare thing.<br> - Especially in my family.<br> Let's get him on the phone.<br> No, you see, my father<br> and I have installed this cold line.<br> He'll thaw, Oliver.<br> He'll thaw, and he'll melt.<br> Believe me, when<br> it's time to go to church...<br> Come on, let's<br> get him on the phone.<br> - Wait. Phil.<br> - What?<br> About the church bit.<br> Well, we're kind of negative on it.<br> Well, I... I didn't necessarily<br> mean the Catholic Church.<br> I...<br> You... you know that<br> Jennifer is Catholic.<br> She may have told you that.<br> And her... sainted mother<br> always dreamed of a...<br> Well, the whole mass<br> rigmarole, but you're...<br> Well, God would<br> bless this union in any church.<br> - Phil...<br> - Yeah.<br> - About the God bit.<br> - Yeah?<br> Well, we're sort of<br> negative about that, too.<br> About God?<br> - About anybody's god?<br> - See...<br> We neither one of us believe...<br> - And we won't be hypocrites.<br> - Well...<br> Well...<br> If that's what you wish,<br> Just tell me who performs the wedding.<br> We do.<br> You mean, do-it-yourself?<br> That's... that's wonderful.<br> I know I'm...<br> I mean, that's...<br> Just... just wonderful.<br> Do it yourself, huh?<br> I think that's...<br> ...just wonderful.<br> But... tell me. Is it...<br> What's the word?<br> - You mean legal?<br> - Legal. Is that it? Is it?<br> Yes. I mean... one<br> of the college chaplains just sort of...<br> No, I mean<br> he sort of presides over it,<br> and then the man and the woman<br> address each other.<br> You mean the bride speaks, too?<br> - It's a new world, Philip.<br> - Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> It's... it's new, all right.<br> - You two ready?<br> - Amen.<br> They haven't started yet.<br> - Friends...<br> - How would I know?<br> I've never been<br> to a do-it-yourself.<br> Let us listen to the words,<br> which they have chosen to read<br> - on this sacred occasion.<br> - Amen.<br> He said "sacred." The priest.<br> - He's not a priest.<br> - He is to me.<br> When our two souls<br> stand up erect and strong,<br> face to face,<br> silent, drawing nigh and nigher,<br> until the lengthening wings break<br> into fire at either curved point...<br> ...what bitter wrong<br> can the earth do to us<br> that we should not long<br> be here contented?<br> Think. In mounting higher,<br> the angels would press on us<br> and aspire to drop some<br> golden orb of perfect song<br> into our deep, dear silence.<br> Let us stay, rather, on earth beloved,<br> Where the unfit,<br> contrarious moods of men<br> recoil away...<br> ...and isolate pure spirits,<br> and permit a place to stand<br> and love in for a day,<br> with darkness<br> and the death-hour rounding it.<br> I give you my hand.<br> I give you my love,<br> more precious than money.<br> I give you myself,<br> before preaching or law.<br> Will you give me yourself?<br> Will you come travel with me?<br> Shall we stick by each other<br> as long as we live?<br> I, Oliver Barrett,<br> take you, Jennifer Cavalleri,<br> to be my wedded wife<br> from this day forward...<br> ...to love and to cherish,<br> till death do us part.<br> I, Jennifer Cavalleri,<br> take you, Oliver Barrett,<br> as my wedded husband,<br> from this day forward,<br> to love and to cherish,<br> till death do us part.<br> By the authority vested in me<br> by the commonwealth of Massachusetts,<br> I pronounce you man and wife.<br> So now I'm being kept by a woman.<br> - You won't like it.<br> - I already do.<br> Oliver, the Shady Lane School<br> is only paying me three thou a year.<br> - Why?<br> - Because my goddamn name<br> - is Mrs. Barrett.<br> - Well, couldn't you be Ms. Cavalleri?<br> If I was Ms. Cavalleri,<br> I'd be the queen of Paris.<br> - I tell you, it's a great bargain.<br> - Oliver, four rooms for $82.50 a month<br> is absolutely impossible<br> this side of Mongolia.<br> But this is the Mongolian<br> section of Cambridge.<br> I have to admit that it's...<br> even worse than I expected.<br> - Yeah, but it's home.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well?<br> - Well what?<br> There's the threshold.<br> Carry me over it.<br> Oh, come on, you don't believe<br> in that sort of nonsense, do you?<br> Carry me, and I'll tell you later.<br> You know, we're almost<br> at the top floor?<br> OK, I'll be a young<br> and beautiful divorce.<br> Hey, what is this, Barrett?<br> Oh, what is this?<br> I'll tell you after we cross<br> the threshold.<br> - OK?<br> - This is not a threshold.<br> Well, I see our name by the bell.<br> Look, it's not an official<br> goddamn threshold.<br> Now, upstairs, you preppie.<br> Why are you so heavy?<br> Did you ever think<br> I might be pregnant?<br> - Are you?<br> - Scared you, didn't I?<br> - No, I...<br> - Don't bullshit me.<br> Well, yeah,<br> for a second, I clutched.<br> - Now, is this the official threshold?<br> - What do you think?<br> - I think if you don't say yes, I'll...<br> - Yes! Yes!<br> - Hey, is there a Barrett in the house?<br> - Hey, where are the kids?<br> Asleep, thank God!<br> It's siesta time. I've got 45 minutes.<br> That's more than they give me.<br> Oh, damn it. I don't know<br> what's wrong with this engine.<br> - You're a Harvard magna.<br> - Not in mechanics.<br> - Welcome to the world, preppie.<br> - Listen, Cavalleri...<br> - The name's Barrett, Barrett.<br> - Sometimes you are really a bitch.<br> - How are they treating you?<br> - Fine, except for the Rittenhouse brat.<br> You know, I swear he'll be breaking<br> and entering before he's ten.<br> - Oh, yeah? What now?<br> - He tried to pinch me.<br> - I don't blame him.<br> - Next time he does,<br> - I'm going to wallop him.<br> - Jesus, no!<br> Not until you get his parents' tip.<br> Damn it.<br> - Let's get the hell out of here.<br> - Hey, don't touch me, Oliver.<br> What a thing to say<br> to your husband.<br> Wash, and you can<br> touch me afterwards.<br> - I will.<br> - Hey, I had another salary hassle today<br> with Ms. Anne Miller Whitman.<br> Well, I hope you<br> laid it on thick this time.<br> I told her how very proud I was<br> to be a member<br> of the faculty<br> of the Shady Lane School.<br> I said, "You know, Ms. Whitman,<br> even Barretts have to pay their rent."<br> - To which, she retorted?<br> - "Ho, Ho, Ho."<br> Define "Ho, Ho, Ho."<br> Thirty-five hundred for the year.<br> - That's ridiculous!<br> - How would you like to support me<br> while I take the courses necessary<br> to teach in public school?<br> Would you please say something?<br> Ho, ho, ho.<br> I thought you were gonna call<br> when the meeting broke.<br> Yeah, but I wanted you to study.<br> Did you have anything to eat?<br> - I waited for you.<br> - But you're a growing boy.<br> - Not anymore.<br> - Yes, you are, in mind.<br> - Did you check the mail?<br> - Just one second, Jenny.<br> This is a crucial precedent.<br> - Did you check the mail?<br> - No, I didn't. Anything vital?<br> - We are cordially invited...<br> - To pay the light bill.<br> ...to a dinner.<br> Your father's 60th birthday.<br> - Did you hear me?<br> - Yes.<br> - RSVP.<br> - You even have to ask?<br> Oliver, I think it's about time.<br> - For what?<br> - You know very well what.<br> Does he have to crawl here<br> on his hands and knees?<br> - Negative.<br> - He's reaching out to you.<br> My mother addressed it.<br> Oliver, think. Sixty years old.<br> Nothing says he's still gonna be around<br> when you're finally ready<br> for a reconciliation.<br> There's not going<br> to be a reconciliation.<br> Someday when you're<br> being bugged by Oliver V...<br> - He won't be Oliver V!<br> - He can be Bozo the Clown,<br> and he'll still going to resent you<br> because you were a Harvard jock!<br> By the time he's a freshman, you'll<br> probably be on the Supreme Court.<br> - He won't resent me!<br> - Why not?<br> Because...<br> Your father loves you, too, Oliver,<br> just the way you're gonna love Bozo,<br> but you Barretts are<br> so goddamn proud and competitive<br> that you'll go through your whole life<br> thinking you hate each other.<br> - If it weren't for you!<br> - Yes!<br> The case is closed!<br> There's still the matter<br> of the RSVP.<br> I think you can handle it.<br> In my whole life, I have never<br> deliberately hurt anyone,<br> and I just don't think I could.<br> Jennifer... just answer "no."<br> OK, what's the number?<br> Can't you just write a note?<br> In a few minutes, I'm gonna<br> lose my nerve. What is the number?<br> Good evening.<br> This is Jennifer Barrett.<br> Oh, Mr. Barrett.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> Fine, thank you.<br> Yes, we did.<br> That's why I'm calling.<br> I'm terribly sorry, sir. I mean...<br> We're terribly sorry,<br> but no, we can't.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oliver, please talk to him.<br> Just say hello.<br> - I will never talk to him.<br> - Please, can't you just do it for me?<br> I've never asked you<br> to do anything in my whole life.<br> - Please, Oliver, just for me.<br> - No.<br> You're a heartless bastard.<br> Mr. Barrett, Oliver<br> would like you to know<br> that in his own special way,<br> he loves you very much.<br> Just get the hell out of my life!<br> I forgot my key.<br> Jenny, I... I'm sorry.<br> Don't.<br> Love means never<br> having to say you're sorry.<br> Paul, would you pay<br> more attention to blending<br> and a little less to showing us<br> your beautiful voice?<br> - But I wasn't!<br> - Yes, you were.<br> Paul, don't bullshit me.<br> You were showing off.<br> - Sorry, Jenny.<br> - OK, one last time,<br> And this time, I want crisp diction.<br> That was really,<br> incredibly, absolutely...<br> - ...not bad.<br> - Oh, Jenny, come on!<br> - Come on, Jenny!<br> - Oh, come on.<br> - Tomorrow at 8:30 sharp, OK?<br> - I'll see you tomorrow at 8:30.<br> - Bye, Jenny.<br> - Bye, Jenny.<br> - See you.<br> - Bye, Jenny.<br> Well, Barrett,<br> what brings you to church?<br> The saloons closed early.<br> Did you get us a tree?<br> Don't worry about it,<br> we'll get one on the way home.<br> What are you doing New Year's Eve?<br> Sleeping.<br> I thought you wanted<br> to spend it with me.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Sleeping.<br> Someday we're going<br> to look back on these days.<br> The sooner, the better.<br> Keep running!<br> Go! Really run! Come on!<br> Keep going!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> - Come on, Dan. Come on.<br> - Hey, Jennifer, Come here!<br> I'm with children.<br> Can't it wait?<br> Jennifer, I said come here.<br> What? Come on!<br> Start it over again.<br> What the hell is it?<br> I've got something important<br> I want to tell you.<br> Couldn't you just<br> tell me over there?<br> - No, I want to be alone with you.<br> - OK.<br> Fantastic news. Here, read.<br> Harvard Law School?<br> You got kicked out.<br> Read it, will you please?<br> It's great news.<br> - You were first in the class?<br> - Not quite.<br> - Third.<br> - Only third, huh?<br> Hey, but that means<br> I make the law review.<br> Well, say something,<br> will you, please?<br> Not until I've met<br> numbers one and two.<br> And the William DE Jersey<br> Memorial Award<br> for the finest senior essay,<br> to Oliver Barrett IV.<br> The family of Mark Howells...<br> - On your feet.<br> - How much?<br> - Five hundred big ones.<br> - Holy sh...<br> Get up.<br> - Quiet!<br> - Come on, come on.<br> The Jennifer Barrett Maternity award.<br> Well, it was a good apartment<br> for 80 bucks.<br> Yeah, now our garage<br> will cost that much.<br> I don't see why you'll<br> need your car in New York.<br> House calls, Jenny.<br> Come on, fancy lawyers for Jonas<br> and Marsh don't make house calls.<br> They do to the houses<br> of Mr. Jonas and Mr. Marsh.<br> - They are both close enough to walk.<br> - Jenny, rich people ride.<br> - Nouveau riche people.<br> - That's us.<br> - Hey, Jenny, you won't laugh.<br> - What?<br> I'm actually getting<br> to like the name Bozo.<br> - For what?<br> - For our kid, damn it.<br> - Our huge and bruising All-Ivy tackle.<br> - Bozo Barrett?<br> Jen, it's the name<br> of a real Harvard super jock.<br> You would actually call our<br> soon-to-be-conceived offspring "Bozo?"<br> Only if he's a boy.<br> We have finally crossed<br> the poverty line.<br> - Not quite.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Not till you carry me<br> over the goddamn threshold.<br> Again? I thought<br> we had run that gamut.<br> Yeah, but you weren't<br> a lawyer, so it wasn't legal.<br> - We live on the 10th floor!<br> - You can carry me in the elevator.<br> Thank God for that.<br> Can I help you folks?<br> Barrett. 10-H.<br> We've got bags in the car.<br> Is the lady all right?<br> I will be when he<br> carries me over the threshold.<br> - I see, newlyweds, huh?<br> - Eternally.<br> Move your ass, preppie.<br> You've got it made, you bastard.<br> Made in the shade.<br> Snug as a bug in a rug.<br> Cut the crap and play.<br> Working for Jonas and Marsh,<br> pulling in the coin.<br> - Play, damn it.<br> - I can't help it.<br> Married to foul-mouth angel-face.<br> Pay attention, will you?<br> - Why should you have all the luck?<br> - Hey, man, it was a long, hard drag.<br> This is the first week<br> in our entire marriage<br> that Jenny hasn't had to work.<br> So, what's she going to do?<br> Well, I want her to study at Julliard,<br> and she wants to have a baby,<br> - So?<br> - So we're making babies.<br> Do you need any help, old buddy?<br> I'll call you if I need you.<br> - Do you know whose fault it is?<br> - I wouldn't use the word fault, Oliver.<br> OK, we'll put it your way.<br> Two 24-year-olds<br> can't seem to make a baby.<br> Obviously, one of us is malfunctioning.<br> - Who?<br> - Jenny.<br> All right, then, we'll adopt kids.<br> Oliver, the problem's<br> more serious than that.<br> Jenny is very sick.<br> Define "very sick."<br> She's dying.<br> That's impossible.<br> I'm sorry to have to tell you this.<br> That's impossible.<br> Well, it's a mistake.<br> It has to be.<br> We've repeated her<br> blood test three times.<br> There's no question about the diagnosis.<br> She'll have to be told soon.<br> We can withhold treatment<br> for a little while, but not for long.<br> We'll have to begin therapy<br> sometime during the next few weeks.<br> She's only 24.<br> - Will it be painful?<br> - Hopefully not.<br> You'll of course want to speak<br> to a hematologist.<br> I can refer you to Dr. Addison.<br> Yeah.<br> What do I do?<br> What can I do for Jenny?<br> Act as normal as possible...<br> ...for as long as possible.<br> That's really the best thing.<br> Normal.<br> Normal. OK, I'll be as normal as hell.<br> Jen?<br> Jenny, I'm home.<br> - Hey, I need a lawyer.<br> - I'm a lawyer.<br> - I need you.<br> - I need you, too.<br> Why? I'm not a lawyer.<br> No, but you're a nut,<br> and I happen to need a nut.<br> - You look lovely, Jenny.<br> - Bullshit.<br> - OK. OK, you look terrible.<br> - No, I do not look terrible.<br> I never look terrible.<br> I look OK for Thursday evening, OK?<br> - There's no poetry in OK.<br> - Screw poetry, Oliver.<br> - Just tell me what you see.<br> - I see you.<br> That's poetry.<br> Hey, Dr. Shapeley<br> said we both checked out.<br> - That's what he told you, too, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> So we just have to keep trying, right?<br> - Yeah. Let's try now.<br> - Right this very minute?<br> Even sooner.<br> Jenny?<br> Jenny! Jenny!<br> Get up, you lazy preppie,<br> would you please,<br> and get out and support me in the manner<br> to which I plan to become accustomed.<br> Come on. Get up.<br> - You meeting Stratton today?<br> - Who?<br> Ray Stratton, your best friend.<br> Your roommate before me.<br> Yeah. We're supposed to play,<br> but I think I'll cancel it.<br> - The hell you will.<br> - Why not?<br> Listen, I don't want a flabby husband.<br> Stay in shape, would you, please?<br> All right, but I'll<br> take you out to dinner.<br> Why?<br> What do you mean, why? Can't I take my<br> goddamn wife out to dinner if I want to?<br> OK, Barrett. Who is she?<br> What's her name?<br> What?<br> If you have to take your wife to dinner<br> in the middle of the week,<br> you must be screwing somebody.<br> - Hey, what's the matter, Ollie?<br> - Off day, that's all.<br> Off day? You've been having<br> an off day for two weeks now.<br> Old man Jonas wanted me to go<br> to Chicago on a big case.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> You know that newscaster<br> that got beat up by the cops?<br> Fantastic. You on the other side<br> of a punch-out rap.<br> - I turned him down.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know. I just<br> couldn't see living in some hotel.<br> Boy, you're really married.<br> Your time will come.<br> - Hey, Mrs. Barrett.<br> - I'm in the kitchen, where I belong.<br> - Get the hell in here, preppie.<br> - Mrs. Barrett, guess what?<br> - You got fired.<br> - I got fired up, and guess where to.<br> - Reno, Nevada.<br> - Paris, France.<br> We'll be there Christmas Day.<br> No, that's not the way<br> we're gonna do it.<br> - Do what?<br> - I don't want Paris.<br> I don't need Paris.<br> I just want you.<br> Well, that you've got, baby.<br> And I want time,<br> which you can't give me.<br> You saw Dr. Shapeley?<br> And his buddy, too.<br> He's a very nice guy.<br> - Who?<br> - Dr. Addison.<br> He's a Yalie. College and med school.<br> But I said you wouldn't mind.<br> No, not if he's a nice guy.<br> He's a nice guy, all right. He didn't<br> bullshit me, and that's what I wanted.<br> - OK, then, for the Yalie doctor.<br> - OK.<br> I'm counting on you to be strong,<br> you goddamn hockey jock.<br> I will, baby. I will.<br> No. I mean for Phil.<br> It's going to be hardest on him.<br> You, after all,<br> You're going to be the merry widower.<br> - I won't be merry.<br> - Yes, you will be.<br> I want you to be merry.<br> You'll be merry, OK?<br> OK.<br> - Enough?<br> - Not for me.<br> I love watching you<br> dodge and weave.<br> - The old hockey fake-out.<br> - I know, that's you all right,<br> the old hockey fake-out.<br> Can we get a cup<br> of hot chocolate?<br> - Sure. I'll even pay.<br> - Very gracious of you.<br> I told you I liked it best<br> when I supported you.<br> You always supported me.<br> I mean, after all, what's money?<br> I don't know.<br> - Hey, could we afford a taxi?<br> - Sure.<br> Where do you want to go?<br> The hospital.<br> She's getting white cells and platelets,<br> which, at the moment,<br> is the most<br> important thing she needs.<br> She doesn't want<br> antimetabolites at all.<br> What does that mean?<br> That's a treatment<br> that slows cell destruction,<br> but there are<br> unpleasant side effects.<br> Jenny's the boss.<br> Whatever she wants.<br> You fellows do everything you can to<br> make sure it doesn't hurt. Everything.<br> - You can be sure of that.<br> - I don't care what it costs.<br> - It could take weeks and months.<br> - Screw the cost.<br> I was saying that there's no way<br> of knowing how long she'll linger.<br> I want her to have<br> the very best.<br> I'm wealthy.<br> I'm rich, really.<br> Really, I'm like a millionaire.<br> - How have you been, Oliver?<br> - Fine, sir.<br> - And how is Jennifer?<br> - She's fine, sir.<br> I need to borrow $5,000<br> for a very good reason.<br> Well?<br> - Sir?<br> - May I know the reason?<br> I can't tell you.<br> Just lend me the money, please.<br> Don't they pay you<br> at Jonas and Marsh?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - And doesn't she teach?<br> Don't call her "she."<br> - Doesn't Jennifer teach?<br> - Let's leave her out of this.<br> Just write out a check, father.<br> It's a personal matter.<br> A very important personal matter.<br> You got some girl in trouble?<br> Yeah.

Phil.<br> How's it going, Mrs. B?<br> It's going, preppie.<br> The troops will be home for Christmas.<br> - That's a little trite.<br> - It's the goddamn truth.<br> Hey, watch your language.<br> There's a grownup present.<br> I hope so.<br> I mean, Phil made a few promises.<br> Don't worry, Jenny.<br> Maybe I ought to let you guys...<br> I'll be nearby.<br> It doesn't hurt, Ollie.<br> Really, it doesn't.<br> It's like falling off a cliff<br> in slow motion, you know?<br> Only after a while, you wish<br> you'd hit the ground, you know?<br> Yeah.<br> Bullshit. You never fell off a cliff<br> in your whole life.<br> Yes, I did... When I met you.<br> Yeah.<br> "What a falling off was there."<br> - Who said that?<br> - I don't know... Shakespeare.<br> Yeah, but who?<br> I mean, what play?<br> I went to Radcliffe.<br> I'm supposed to remember those things.<br> I once knew all<br> The Mozart Kchel listings.<br> - Big deal.<br> - You bet it was.<br> What number<br> is the A-major concerto?<br> I don't know. I'll look it up.<br> No, but I used to know<br> all those things.<br> I really did.<br> I used to know all those things.<br> You want to talk music?<br> What do you want to talk, funerals?<br> No, I don't.<br> Ollie?<br> I told Phil you could have<br> a Catholic service<br> and you'd say OK. OK?<br> It will really help him a lot, you know?<br> OK.<br> - Now you got to stop being sick.<br> - Me?<br> That guilty look on your face...<br> It's sick.<br> Would you stop blaming yourself,<br> you goddamn stupid preppie?<br> It's nobody's fault.<br> It's not your fault.<br> That's the only thing<br> I'm going to ask you.<br> Otherwise, I know you'll be OK.<br> Screw Paris.<br> What?<br> Screw Paris and music and all that stuff<br> you thought you stole from me.<br> I don't care,<br> don't you believe that?<br> Then get the hell out of here.<br> I don't want you at my goddamn deathbed.<br> I believe you. I really do.<br> That's better.<br> Would you please do<br> something for me, Ollie?<br> Would you please hold me?<br> No. I mean, really hold me...<br> next to me.<br> Philip.<br> I wish...<br> I wish I hadn't promised Jenny...<br> I wish I hadn't promised Jenny<br> to be strong for you.<br> Oliver.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I made a couple of calls,<br> and as soon as I found out,<br> I jumped right in the car.<br> Oliver, I want to help.<br> Jenny's dead.<br> - I'm sorry...<br> - Love...<br> Love means never<br> having to say you're sorry.<br>
