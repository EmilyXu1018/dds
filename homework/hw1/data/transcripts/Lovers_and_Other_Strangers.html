                        Susan?<br> Wake up, Susan.<br> Mike, what is it?<br> - It's 3:00 in the morning.<br> - I'm not getting married.<br> Remember what I said to you?<br> "If I ask you to marry me,<br> can I take it back?"<br> And you said I could, didn't you?<br> I'm taking it back, that's all.<br> Look, I don't think I could be faithful.<br> Whenever I walk down the street,<br> I want to grab every ass I see.<br> That's not normal.<br> India's overpopulated.<br> The suicide rate is up.<br> We'll all be sterilized.<br> The air is polluted.<br> Is that the kind of world<br> you want to get married in?<br> Susan, someday maybe I'll get good<br> and stoned...<br> we'll go off and we'll do it.<br> That way I won't feel like I'm married.<br> What do you say?<br> Give me a break, take the pressure off me.<br> Call off the wedding.<br> All right, Susan.<br> I've got to lay my cards on the table.<br> I wasn't going to tell you 'cause<br> I didn't want to hurt your feelings...<br> but there's something about you<br> that really bugs me.<br> You have very fat arms.<br> I tried. I really tried, Susan...<br> but it's getting close.<br> There's only three days left,<br> and I can't go any further.<br> You and Ritchie<br> going to pick up the tuxedos today?<br> You'll have to get the cufflinks<br> for the ushers, too.<br> Did I tell you I got a salad bowl<br> from Johnny and Wilma?<br> - It's from Tiffany's.<br> - No kidding.<br> Do you think he'll make the wedding?<br> - Who, Mike?<br> - No. Father Gregory.<br> - Mike's really uptight about the wedding.<br> - Not Johnny. Weddings make him sexy.<br> Wilma? Cool it with Dad.<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you trust anyone over 30?<br> Mr. and Mrs. Henderson.<br> - Bernice.<br> - I always wanted to call you Bernice.<br> You should have been<br> at the Fitzpatrick wedding.<br> It was absolutely fabulous.<br> It was incredible.<br> They had a Michelangelo statue.<br> It was a little slave with an urn.<br> The champagne just simply spilled over.<br> It was marvelous.<br> A wedding like that... There you are.<br> Didn't I see you at Wilma's wedding?<br> - That's right.<br> - I never forget a face.<br> Busy, busy, busy.<br> I have to leave you. Help yourself.<br> - Everything's all right.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Look who's here.<br> - Here are my little girls.<br> - Dad.<br> - How are you, Susan, my sweetheart?<br> Hello, Wilma. How are you?<br> - Hi, Kathy.<br> - Sit down.<br> Wilma, a little champagne here.<br> I forgot. You don't drink too much, do you?<br> And a little for my baby. There you are.<br> Now, a toast to the bride.<br> - To the bride.<br> - To the bride.<br> Is everybody comfortable?<br> Look at me. I was so beautiful then.<br> Did I see you at Wilma's wedding?<br> - I'm Wilma.<br> - That's why you were there.<br> Busy, busy, busy.<br> I won't be too much longer.<br> - Is Phyllis better?<br> - Who?<br> Your roommate. Will she be well enough<br> to come to the wedding?<br> - I hope so.<br> - Johnny looks the same as he does now.<br> Big Italian lug.<br> Don't complain, Wilma.<br> At least you're married.<br> If Mike makes half the husband<br> that Johnny is...<br> I'll be satisfied.<br> He's won't go into your business.<br> I can tell you that right now.<br> Don't you worry, Susan.<br> He has to do his thing. I understand.<br> There's no gap here.<br> - Look who's here.<br> - Mike.<br> What a pleasant surprise, son.<br> Susan didn't tell us you were coming.<br> - I didn't know.<br> - You all know my brother, Ritchie?<br> Hi, Ritchie.<br> Wilma, I hear we got a great salad bowl<br> from you and Johnny.<br> - It's from Tiffany's.<br> - No kidding?<br> Sit down, Ritchie.<br> I need the key to the apartment back.<br> Mike? As long as you're both here...<br> why don't you and Ritchie<br> have lunch with us?<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Henderson.<br> We really got to split. Right, Ritchie?<br> - We'll be seeing you at the barbecue.<br> - Right.<br> Ritchie, we're expecting you<br> and your lovely wife.<br> So long.<br> - Good-bye, boys.<br> - Bye-bye, son.<br> Is Joan coming to the barbecue?<br> Barbecue? I don't know<br> if she'll make the wedding.<br> I love weddings.<br> They're such a family thing.<br> And when it comes down<br> to the real nitty-gritty...<br> that's all a man has. His family.<br> - Mike, do you want some more soup?<br> - No, I'm full.<br> - How about you, Frank? More soup?<br> - I don't want no more soup.<br> - Go ahead, Frank. It's good soup.<br> - All right, let me have some more soup.<br> Ritchie?<br> - Mike?<br> - No.<br> You're sure?<br> It's been a long time<br> since we all had a meal together.<br> - How's Nick?<br> - Who?<br> - Your roommate.<br> - Nick. He's fine.<br> Will we finally meet him at the wedding?<br> I promise you,<br> you'll see my roommate at the wedding.<br> A wedding is such a joyous event.<br> It's the joining of two people<br> together through thick and thin...<br> in a union of spiritual goodness,<br> forever and ever...<br> that only God can put asunder.<br> - You want some more veal, Mike?<br> - No, Ma.<br> - You want some more veal?<br> - I don't want no more veal.<br> - The butcher gave you good veal, Frank.<br> - Yeah, he's a good butcher.<br> It's not veiny.<br> I hate veiny veal.<br> So what's the story, Ritchie?<br> Get off his back.<br> Let him work out his own problems.<br> - Quiet. We're not talking about marriage.<br> - We're talking about divorce.<br> - If it was marriage, you could talk.<br> - But we're talking about divorce.<br> - So be quiet.<br> - Marriage is different from divorce.<br> So what's the story, Ritchie?<br> We're just not compatible.<br> - Hear that? They're not compatible.<br> - I heard, but I'm not listening.<br> Married for six years, all of a sudden<br> they want to be compatible.<br> - It's a phase.<br> - These stupid kids today.<br> Don't know what to do with themselves,<br> so they get a divorce for kicks.<br> That's what it is. Kicks.<br> It's 1970. It happens to a lot of couples.<br> There's nothing you can do about it.<br> - Never in our family.<br> - We don't believe in it.<br> Happens to people who don't give a damn.<br> Would the King and Queen of England<br> get a divorce?<br> - Don't believe in it.<br> - It's why they're together.<br> They know what'd happen to England<br> if they broke up.<br> - But our son believes in it.<br> - He wouldn't care what happened...<br> to England or anybody.<br> It's 1970, so he's getting a divorce.<br> He was such a beautiful groom.<br> Everybody said it was made in heaven.<br> His grandmother was so happy<br> she lived to see him marry.<br> Jackie next door has three kids,<br> and he's never even been to college.<br> - Mike's not getting a divorce.<br> - I'm not even married yet.<br> So what's the story, Ritchie?<br> I think they're hinting at something.<br> They want to know the story.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Upstairs.<br> Sorry to split, but we're not going<br> to talk about marriage...<br> and that's the only thing I know about.<br> Right, we're going to talk about divorce,<br> about which I'm an expert.<br> You're the only one<br> who's ever come close, wise guy.<br> Your brother's getting married.<br> How can you get a divorce?<br> Shut up, Beatrice.<br> Where the hell do you think you're going?<br> Joan and I talked it out,<br> and believe me, it's better this way.<br> Better?<br> - For who? Your mother?<br> - Your father?<br> - I'll tell you who it's better for. You.<br> - Always you.<br> - Do you know what's better for you?<br> - You don't know.<br> - Only you know.<br> - Did you listen when I told you...<br> - not to marry her in the first place?<br> - Listen to your father.<br> Don't you understand?<br> Joan and I are just not happy together.<br> Hear that, Beatrice?<br> They're not happy together.<br> I heard, Frank.<br> Who's happy?<br> Do you see me running around<br> dancing in the streets?<br> Do you see your father running around<br> dancing in the streets?<br> What, are you better than me?<br> You think your mother and I are happy?<br> - You and Mom aren't happy?<br> - No.<br> Then why did you stay together?<br> - We're content.<br> - We're content.<br> These kids today,<br> all they're looking for is happiness.<br> Don't look for happiness, Ritchie.<br> It'll only make you miserable.<br> If I'm not going to be happy,<br> I don't want to be married.<br> Where the hell does he think he's going?<br> You think you're smart.<br> I'm telling you you're not smart.<br> I know you're not smart.<br> You're stupid.<br> You think only married people are unhappy?<br> - What about Eddie Shride?<br> - Or Tommy Pizzo?<br> - Or your Aunt Pauline?<br> - Or Father Burke?<br> - You want to end up like them?<br> - Unhappy?<br> Why do you think<br> we all keep our families together?<br> For happiness? No. For the family.<br> - For the kids.<br> - We don't have any kids.<br> I told you not to have any kids.<br> I told him not to have any kids.<br> What about your nephew, Mark?<br> You and Joan are his godparents.<br> You got a responsibility.<br> Who'll take care of him<br> if, God forbid, we all die in a fire?<br> We could all get killed<br> crossing the street by a truck.<br> - Or die of a heart<br> attack in the living room.<br> - Or get electrocuted<br> in the bathtub.<br> Believe me, dying is no picnic.<br> If you're not going to talk intelligently,<br> I'm not going to discuss it with you.<br> For God's sake, Frank, do something.<br> Don't tell me you won't discuss it.<br> I'll take off my strap...<br> and give you a beating.<br> I don't care how old you are.<br> Don't you touch him.<br> That's all you know, the strap.<br> Where were you when he was young<br> and really needed a good beating?<br> - It's all your fault.<br> - Don't give me it's my fault.<br> It's your fault. You spoiled him.<br> It's all your fault.<br> I don't blame Ritchie. I don't blame Joan.<br> I don't even blame you.<br> You know who I blame?<br> The Ecumenical council.<br> Once you start monkeying around<br> with who's a saint and who isn't...<br> it makes the young people crazy.<br> God, why did this have to happen?<br> Maybe I wasn't a good mother.<br> Is it my fault? It is my fault,<br> isn't it, Ritchie?<br> Stop it. It's nobody's fault.<br> It's got to be somebody's fault.<br> I want to know whose fault.<br> We'll talk to him at the wedding, Frank.<br> Joan will be there, too.<br> Would you believe I lived with them<br> till I got married?<br> When they get started<br> they can really put you away.<br> You and Susan had the right idea.<br> You lived together.<br> You got to know each other.<br> I grew up with Joan,<br> too scared to do what you did.<br> It was a different world.<br> So we got married...<br> and then we found out it was a mistake.<br> But it's not going to happen to you.<br> You got it made.<br> What makes me so special?<br> I'm walking down the same aisle you did.<br> I saw our wedding pictures<br> at Donaldson's today.<br> Yeah?<br> You look the same, Johnny...<br> - but I've gotten older.<br> - No, you haven't, honey.<br> But you have to keep in shape.<br> Remember, you haven't got four years<br> in the Marines behind you.<br> Do you think Susan will be happy<br> with Mike?<br> Why not? They've been making it for a year.<br> Could be just physical.<br> That's a good place to start.<br> I'll be right out, Johnny.<br> He and Dr. Edwardes were on a high,<br> sloping roof.<br> And when he saw Edwardes plunge<br> over the edge to his death...<br> he also saw the angry proprietor<br> hiding behind the chimney, laughing.<br> The symbolism<br> of the small wheel escapes me.<br> You are thinking that now, Dr. Murchison.<br> Honey, wait a minute.<br> Ingrid Bergman just found out<br> who the murderer is.<br> - You've seen Spellbound<br> four times.<br> - Six times. It's one of my<br> all-time favorites.<br> Convicted as a sane man...<br> and killed in the electric chair<br> for your crime.<br> - I'm going to telephone...<br> - Boy, Ingrid Bergman.<br> What about Gregory Peck?<br> - He hasn't got your looks.<br> - That's true.<br> Wait a minute, honey.<br> You're going to make me miss the ending.<br> Okay, I'll wait.<br> Any husband of Constance<br> is a husband of mine.<br> - All right. Goodbye. Good luck.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Good night, honey.<br> Come on, Wilma. I'm tired.<br> Are you going to make love to me or not?<br> - I owe you one.<br> - You owe me two.<br> How do you figure I owe you two?<br> Last Friday and the Wednesday before,<br> when your mother stayed over...<br> and you didn't want to make noise.<br> Okay, now I owe you three. I'm good for it.<br> What?<br> Come on, Wilma.<br> I'm not in the mood right now.<br> All right, if you really don't want to.<br> I don't want you to do anything<br> you don't want to do.<br> Don't you ever touch me again.<br> Will you put the cigarette out<br> and go to sleep?<br> - I can't sleep when I'm like this.<br> - It's all in your mind.<br> - It is not. I feel sexy.<br> - It's just nerves. Have a sandwich.<br> Come on, Wilma. In the morning.<br> I'm not interested in the morning.<br> It's not romantic in the morning.<br> - It's romantic now.<br> - To me it's work.<br> Look, it's Thursday already.<br> We haven't made love in 10 days.<br> We both work very hard<br> to make love at least twice a week...<br> so if we don't tonight...<br> there's going to be a lot of pressure on us<br> to catch up.<br> It wouldn't be that way<br> if you didn't nag me about it all the time.<br> Nag? I've tried<br> every subtle way of reaching you...<br> except showing stag films.<br> I get the feeling that you're trying<br> to make my virility look impotent.<br> - When did that feeling first hit you?<br> - The day I married you.<br> - I was dynamite with other women.<br> - They were lucky to be there...<br> with the record holder<br> in three-second intercourse.<br> Out of all the women in the world...<br> I had to go marry<br> an equal-time-orgasm fanatic.<br> Read a couple of Ladies' Home Journals<br> and all you can think is "Me, too. "<br> And why not "me, too?"<br> You really want to take over, don't you?<br> Don't think I haven't<br> noticed the new wardrobe...<br> with the pants, the suits, the ties.<br> You really look butch.<br> Butch? I'm more feminine<br> than you'll ever be.<br> - All I want is a little tenderness.<br> - Look who wants tenderness.<br> I'll give you tenderness.<br> There's your tenderness.<br> You better decide<br> whether you want to be a man or a woman...<br> and then talk tenderness to me, Wilma.<br> Or is it Willy?<br> I tell you what.<br> You decide what you want to be first,<br> and then I'll be what's left.<br> You think you're so masculine<br> because whenever we have a problem...<br> you roll over, you go to sleep,<br> or get drunk, or try to act rough with me.<br> I got a hot flash for you.<br> Those tough Marine drill sergeants<br> are the biggest fags in the world!<br> What did you say?<br> Don't you talk about<br> the Marine Corps that way.<br> Okay. They're the biggest latent fags.<br> But they're not real men.<br> A real man is warm and understanding...<br> and tender, and gentle,<br> and loving, and sensitive, and-<br> And what's a woman?<br> A woman is strong,<br> and responsible, and brave, and-<br> And what? And what?<br> A woman is very...<br> I don't know what a woman is.<br> I don't see any difference<br> between us anymore.<br> At the wedding,<br> we'll rent an extra room for the kids.<br> By then I'll be a little rested.<br> We'll order some champagne.<br> It'll be like a second honeymoon.<br> How's that sound?<br> All right, honey.<br> Good night. Put the light out.<br> Remember, now you owe me three.<br> - Susan, you're...<br> - Rare.<br> - Wilma?<br> - Medium.<br> - Johnny?<br> - Same as mine.<br> Mother's is medium-rare,<br> and Kathy's is medium-rare.<br> Mike's I won't start till he comes.<br> Someday we're going to move to Florida<br> so I can barbecue all year round.<br> I don't understand...<br> why you can't put<br> the Trepannis with the Hendersons.<br> Because oil and water don't mix. Bernice,<br> the Trepannis are Italian, New York.<br> Hal's relatives are Irish, Bridgeport.<br> - Johnny, don't tire yourself. Take it easy.<br> - All right, guys. Come on. Let's go.<br> Boys, you're going to wear your father out.<br> - Son, how do you like yours?<br> - Charred.<br> Remember me?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Ritchie's getting a divorce.<br> That's too bad. I'm sorry.<br> I said I was sorry.<br> What's that got to do with us?<br> If you don't get married,<br> you don't get a divorce.<br> Are you just going<br> to be uptight all the time now?<br> Maybe.<br> What do you want to do?<br> Call off the wedding?<br> - That's right.<br> - Go on just as we are?<br> Why not? It's been beautiful<br> for a year and a half.<br> - You mean it?<br> - Yeah, okay.<br> That's it. Let's go home.<br> Wait. There's just one thing.<br> - You see that man over there?<br> - You mean the Charcoal King?<br> That man is going<br> to get up tomorrow morning...<br> put on his striped trousers,<br> and wait for my mother...<br> who will be putting on her $900 dress<br> from Bergdorf Goodman.<br> And they will go together<br> to our family church...<br> to greet over 100 people who are<br> coming to see him give the bride away.<br> You're trying to make me look<br> like the bad one.<br> It won't work.<br> I owe you nothing, baby, you get it?<br> I'm not talking about me.<br> I'm talking about that man...<br> who has taken over<br> the Grand Ballroom of the Stoneridge Inn...<br> hired musicians, paid for 150 dinners,<br> I'll pay back every penny.<br> I've got about $20. Take it as a deposit.<br> Don't give it to me. Give it to him.<br> That's all you have to do.<br> I will. You're damn right I will.<br> - This charred enough for you, son?<br> - Mr. Henderson, I'm Phyllis.<br> - Who?<br> - Susan's roommate...<br> the one she's been living with<br> for a year and a half.<br> Let's walk a little.<br> - If you don't believe me, ask-<br> - I believe you. No gap.<br> When Susan walks down that aisle<br> in her white bridal gown...<br> Virgin Susan meets Father Gregory,<br> that's hypocrisy.<br> We're, like, married already.<br> I don't want to go through with this sham.<br> Do you understand?<br> I understand, Mike. Sit down.<br> There's no gap here, Mike, believe me.<br> Maybe it was all right in your time,<br> but it's not right for Susan and me.<br> - We don't live lies anymore.<br> - We have two girls.<br> You're two brothers, aren't you?<br> Maybe if you had a sister...<br> you'd understand about mothers<br> and daughters and weddings.<br> Weddings aren't planned<br> a few months ahead.<br> Weddings are planned<br> from the time the girl is about six.<br> Susan went to her first masquerade party<br> at eight...<br> dressed as a bride.<br> Please.<br> What would you rather do, Mike?<br> Run away to Canada?<br> I sure would.<br> It's up to you, Mike.<br> All you have to do is weigh your own hurt<br> against the hurt of all the others...<br> and then do what's best.<br> But whatever you decide, I'll understand.<br> No gap.<br> - Did you tell him?<br> - I told him.<br> Where do we stand?<br> In front of Father Gregory.<br> - Don't do it for me.<br> - I'm not doing it for you.<br> I'm doing it for a little<br> eight-year-old girl...<br> who went to her first masquerade<br> dressed as a bride.<br> - He told you that?<br> - You never did.<br> Is there anything else I should know?<br> Just that I love you, you son of a bitch.<br> - Mother, the barbecue's going beautifully.<br> - Kathy, if we place-<br> I have nothing more to say<br> about the Trepannis and the Hendersons.<br> Don't ask my opinion, Bernice.<br> Don't ask my opinion<br> about the seating plan...<br> or anything else connected<br> with your daughter's wedding.<br> Do something. You're so good with her.<br> Don't worry, Mother. I'll handle it.<br> - Are you in there?<br> - No, go away.<br> Let me in. I want to talk to you.<br> There's nothing to say.<br> Nothing. It's all nothing.<br> - Goodbye, Hal.<br> - Goodbye, Kathy.<br> I love you so much. You're my whole life.<br> I can't live without you.<br> I couldn't live without you. I love you.<br> You didn't mean what you just said.<br> There's nothing to say.<br> Nothing. It's all nothing.<br> I don't want it anymore.<br> I promise you,<br> as soon as Susan gets married...<br> I'll ask Bernice for a divorce.<br> You promised that last year<br> and the year before.<br> - This time will be different.<br> - "As soon as Wilma has another baby. "<br> - Please, Kathy.<br> - "As soon as Susan gets married. "<br> She's getting married, Hal,<br> and where's mine?<br> This could be dangerous.<br> Bernice might hear us.<br> I don't care anymore.<br> I never want to see you again.<br> If you let 10 years of love end<br> in a bathroom...<br> I'll lose all respect for myself.<br> - Goodbye, Hal.<br> - Goodbye, Kathy.<br> I love you so much. You're my whole life.<br> I can't live without you.<br> These few precious moments<br> we have together are everything.<br> They are precious.<br> My knee.<br> Sorry, Kathy. Get up.<br> You're hurting my muscle.<br> Why must it be sordid like this?<br> Sordid?<br> How could you call this sordid?<br> You can't help who you love<br> and who you don't love.<br> I love you, and I want you to be happy.<br> And I don't love Bernice,<br> but I want her to be happy.<br> And I do love my children,<br> and I want them to be happy.<br> But I don't want my wanting Bernice<br> to be happy...<br> to take away from my love for you.<br> But my wanting my children to be happy,<br> while not taking away my love for you...<br> will make Bernice happy,<br> and therefore make the children happy.<br> I want everyone to be happy.<br> Everyone.<br> - That could be my biggest fault.<br> - I want everyone to be happy, too.<br> Bernice is really a wonderful girl.<br> That's why it's hell for me.<br> She's so boring.<br> I know.<br> All she's interested in is making a home<br> for me and the kids...<br> the PTA and Bloomingdale's,<br> the A&P and the Girl Scouts.<br> - I want that, too.<br> - But you're such a vital person.<br> I am.<br> - Why don't you tell Bernice?<br> - Because I don't want to hurt her.<br> - Do you want to hurt me?<br> - Of course not.<br> Somebody has to get hurt.<br> In a situation like this,<br> somebody has to get hurt.<br> Do you want Bernice to get hurt?<br> No, I don't want to hurt Bernice.<br> - Do you want my children to get hurt?<br> - No.<br> - I don't want to...<br> - Then who should get hurt? Me?<br> - I feel nauseous.<br> - Don't get sick on me, please.<br> - I can't help it.<br> - Kathy, please.<br> I'll tell Bernice. I'll tell her<br> Saturday night, after the wedding.<br> Jerry, how would you like<br> to take Susan's cousin to the wedding?<br> - A cousin? Are you kidding?<br> - He'll do it. He doesn't have a date.<br> You're both single.<br> Who knows? You might hit it off.<br> Wait a minute. I know it's your wedding,<br> but Saturday night's a Saturday night.<br> Why shouldn't I score?<br> I don't want to waste a Saturday night.<br> Of course she's great-looking.<br> Just your type.<br> - I don't like to gamble. - Why don't you<br> take her for a drink tonight?<br> - Okay, if you think I can score.<br> - That's entirely up to you.<br> - What's up to him?<br> - Where they meet.<br> She can meet you tonight.<br> She better not be a dog.<br> There's 10,000 chicks waiting for my body.<br> Where?<br> You tell her where. Here's Brenda.<br> Hello, Jerry. This is Brenda.<br> - Hello, Brenda. This is Jerry.<br> - Where?<br> - The action place.<br> - Where?<br> Alan's on Greenwich Street. 9:00 sharp.<br> Fine. Bye, Jerry.<br> He has a strong voice.<br> Very masculine.<br> What'll it be?<br> A gin and coke.<br> - Together?<br> - Yeah.<br> Smooth.<br> - Jerry?<br> - Brenda?<br> Come on. Let's go over to the bar.<br> - All right.<br> - All right, Brenda?<br> It's very nice of you to ask me for a drink<br> when you don't know me.<br> A man's got to gamble.<br> Excuse me.<br> - What are you going to have?<br> - Same as you.<br> Same.<br> So you're Susan's cousin?<br> We're close. We went through<br> the Columbia riots together.<br> - You went to Columbia?<br> - No, I was just an outside agitator.<br> That's heavy.<br> There's a table.<br> Come on, we'll be more comfortable.<br> I'll get the drinks.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse us.<br> Here we are.<br> This is much more intimate.<br> I love out-of-town weddings, don't you?<br> The ride over, the sleepover...<br> - Mike and Susan are really lucky.<br> - In a way...<br> but I'm not sure if I dig<br> the whole marriage scene.<br> It's all right for some people, I guess.<br> But I don't know if it's today.<br> You know what I mean, "today"? Today.<br> Today is, you live free. Man, woman, love...<br> You don't need a diploma, do you?<br> In a way you might be right.<br> This friend of mine was going<br> with this Cuban guy...<br> who knew this girl who had a friend<br> who used to date Che Guevara.<br> He was really down on marriage, too.<br> - Did you see the movie?<br> - No.<br> - Me, neither.<br> - I think he made a mistake.<br> - Che?<br> - No, the bartender.<br> - He put in gin instead of rum.<br> - No, that's what I ordered. Gin and coke.<br> Have you always been single?<br> Name me one married couple<br> you know that's happy.<br> The Burtons.<br> - You know the Burtons?<br> - Not exactly...<br> but one day<br> I was sitting in Ryker's Restaurant...<br> and her chauffeur came in<br> to get her a container of coffee...<br> and I saw her sitting in the limousine.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> She looked very content.<br> I never take a blind date. Never.<br> But this time I'm glad I did.<br> You're even better than Mike said you were.<br> You know what you are?<br> - You're not disappointed?<br> - Not me. No, sir.<br> - My God.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I left the gas on in my apartment.<br> The whole apartment is liable to blow up.<br> Do you mind?<br> I don't know how I could have done that.<br> - Did you read this month's Cosmopolitan?<br> - No.<br> Helen Gurley Brown<br> says that if you go to a man's apartment...<br> after just beginning a relationship,<br> you're just asking for trouble.<br> - Really?<br> - But I don't agree.<br> How can you generalize<br> about a thing like that?<br> Right.<br> Who you are, who the person is,<br> and what your particular needs are...<br> can't help but color your true feelings.<br> - That's why I'll wait for you out here.<br> - What?<br> - I'd rather wait for you out here.<br> - Why?<br> I don't feel like going<br> to a person's apartment...<br> when I hardly know the person.<br> Not that anything's going to happen.<br> It's just the idea of the thing.<br> - You know what I mean.<br> - But I told you, it's just the gas.<br> Gas. Really, how corny can you get?<br> Corny? You smoking? No smoking inside.<br> Move out of the way.<br> Cover yourself.<br> The whole building could blow up.<br> You ready?<br> My God! It is gas.<br> It's lucky we came back.<br> - I'm sorry. I thought...<br> - No, I understand.<br> What a nice decor.<br> Sends off very good vibrations.<br> Very masculine. How much?<br> - $165.<br> - Gas and electric included?<br> Yes.<br> As long as we're here,<br> why don't we sit down for a while and talk?<br> - About what?<br> - Life.<br> Life? Okay.<br> - Can I make you a martini?<br> - No, thanks. I had enough at the bar.<br> How about some pistachio nuts?<br> They're very good.<br> - How do you feel about pot?<br> - Pot?<br> I definitely think it should be legalized.<br> The only reason<br> I personally don't take it...<br> is because I don't think<br> a person should use an outside stimulus...<br> when they could be turned on by the world.<br> Brenda, let me tell you something about pot.<br> When you take it...<br> your taste buds become so vividly sensitive<br> that a grapefruit tastes like caviar.<br> Your whole ability to touch, to love,<br> to see, to understand...<br> to feel, to know, is magnified...<br> till you could split the universe open<br> like a walnut...<br> and know its secrets.<br> - Okay, let me have some.<br> - I don't have any.<br> I had some. I used it this morning<br> when I was cooking.<br> Because of the fuzz. Didn't want them<br> to catch it. I made an omelet.<br> Do you believe the man is the love object<br> and the woman is the other?<br> What?<br> Did you read<br> The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir?<br> - No.<br> - That's what Simone says...<br> but I don't agree.<br> Why do I have to be the other?<br> I have as much right<br> to be the love object as the man does.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Okay.<br> - Is your building rent-controlled?<br> - No.<br> - How much do you pay?<br> - $150.<br> Could you please take your hand off?<br> I'd like to cross my legs.<br> Brenda, take off your clothes.<br> Take off all your clothes.<br> - What? You kidding?<br> - I'm kidding. Of course I'm kidding.<br> Can I speak frankly?<br> This friend of mine was going with this chap<br> she picked up in Central Park, at the zoo...<br> and she spent the whole weekend with him.<br> It was a very full two and one-half days.<br> You know what I mean by full?<br> Full? Yeah. You mean full.<br> Right. The sexual thing was there...<br> but don't get me wrong,<br> so was the spirituality.<br> - Did you read The Prophet by Khalil Gibran?<br> - No.<br> "I am you, and you are me, and we are one. "<br> They were one.<br> At his house, her house,<br> all over town, they were one.<br> He was supposed to call her Monday.<br> A whole week goes by and he doesn't call.<br> So next Friday she bumps into him again,<br> same place, in front of the snake house.<br> So he says, "Let's go to my place. "<br> Can you imagine?<br> When he hadn't even called?<br> - Terrible.<br> - It was a very full two and one-half days.<br> But you want<br> to hear something really depressing?<br> Not only didn't this guy call her,<br> he never even bought her a coke.<br> I could never respect a man like that.<br> - You know what I mean, Jerry?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you?<br> - Yes.<br> Brenda, where are you going?<br> What are you doing? What's the matter?<br> - Will you take me home, Jerry?<br> - But why?<br> I don't want to end up like my friend,<br> the one in the zoo.<br> But we were having such a nice time.<br> Okay.<br> - You don't have to take me home, Jer.<br> - No, that's all right. That's okay.<br> I do like you, but this is our first date...<br> and I don't believe<br> in fooling around on the first date.<br> That may be old-fashioned,<br> but those are my values.<br> - You understand?<br> - Of course I understand. I respect them.<br> After all, there are more important things<br> in life than sex.<br> Thank you, Jerry.<br> I know we met just a couple of hours ago,<br> but just what do I mean to you?<br> Am I just a passing train<br> you want to board for the night...<br> or are you attracted to my inner being...<br> and this night could be the start<br> of a meaningful relationship?<br> The second one.<br> Thank you for taking me home, Jerry.<br> - But, Brenda-<br> - You'll see. You'll be glad we waited.<br> Listen, I'll...<br> - Hello, Father. It's Beatrice Vecchio.<br> - Hello, Beatrice.<br> I hope the weather holds up<br> for Mike's wedding.<br> I hope so, too, Father.<br> Mike's such a good boy.<br> And now he has the perfect girl<br> from a nice Catholic family.<br> Never had a problem with Mike.<br> Now this thing with Ritchie.<br> Did he happen to mention to you...<br> anything about this business<br> with him and Joan?<br> You know I'm not allowed to divulge<br> what's said in the confessional.<br> I'm sorry, Father.<br> Would you like to hear my confession now?<br> - If you wish.<br> - Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.<br> It's been three days since<br> my last confession.<br> I listened to gossip twice,<br> and I exaggerated four times...<br> and I lied to my husband when I told him<br> that I couldn't make homemade macaroni...<br> because I burned my hand<br> and couldn't roll the dough...<br> but actually I could have.<br> It was a small burn...<br> and I could have rolled the dough,<br> but I wasn't in the mood.<br> I usually make the dough<br> the day before, anyway...<br> then leave it overnight in a cool room.<br> - I see. You say one "Our Father"-<br> - And I said "hell" twice...<br> and I yelled at the insurance man...<br> and I didn't apologize to my sister Pauline<br> for not answering her phone call.<br> Should I confess that I asked you<br> to divulge Ritchie's confession?<br> I don't remember you asking.<br> Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.<br> It's been about five or six years<br> since my last confession.<br> What made you come after all these years?<br> My son, Michael,<br> is getting married Saturday...<br> I figured it's a nice gesture<br> for the parents...<br> to receive communion.<br> That's why I...<br> - You know.<br> - I see.<br> And what were your sins during that time?<br> I swore a lot at my wife...<br> and I didn't come to church on Sundays<br> because I got bursitis in my knee...<br> and it hurts a lot when I kneel too long.<br> - Yes?<br> - What?<br> Six years is a long time.<br> Is there something else you'd like<br> to confess?<br> No, that's it.<br> Have we tried enough for you?<br> - I'll miss you tonight.<br> - Come on. It's only for one night.<br> I'm going to miss you, too.<br> Let's have our honeymoon now.<br> Name it. I'll go anywhere.<br> The bridal suite of the Stoneridge Inn.<br> - You wouldn't. You're too straight.<br> - Try me.<br> Beautiful.<br> - You're still going to marry me?<br> - I'll let you know after the honeymoon.<br> We'd like the bridal suite.<br> - The bridal suite?<br> - We're just married.<br> - How long will you be staying?<br> - One night.<br> I can let you have it, then.<br> But you'll have to be out in the morning.<br> We have a wedding reception<br> in the afternoon.<br> The Henderson wedding.<br> We'll be out.<br> Would you like to sign "Mrs. "?<br> It's the first time.<br> The bridal suite for Mr. and Mrs. Defalco.<br> Do you believe this?<br> This is our honeymoon night.<br> Let's go to bed.<br> I'm not coming out till I'm married.<br> - Hi, Phyllis.<br> - Hi, Nick.<br> You're the most beautiful girl<br> at the wedding.<br> - Are you married?<br> - Yes.<br> You looked so beautiful at the church.<br> Phil and I are having a terrific time<br> at the wedding.<br> Hello, Kim. Hello, Carol.<br> Carol's agreed<br> to sing anytime you want her to, Bernice.<br> How nice. Hal, did you hear that?<br> Carol's agreed to sing.<br> Yes. Later, little girl.<br> You look thin and worn-out, Johnny.<br> - Is Wilma taking good care of you?<br> - Fine, mama.<br> That old bitch never lets go.<br> In his Analysis of Compatible Marriages,<br> Wilhelm Reiker says...<br> that the problem of the mother-in-law<br> is dependent on the maturity of the wife.<br> Wilhelm Reiker's a fag.<br> I'll tell you what marriage is all about.<br> - That's what it's all about.<br> - They're beautiful boys.<br> - Where did you go on your honeymoon?<br> - Aruba.<br> Aruba.<br> - Want some more soup, Frank?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm getting worried, Frank.<br> Joan isn't here yet.<br> - Don't worry about it. She'll get here.<br> - I hope so, Frank.<br> - You must be Mike's roommate.<br> - No, Mom.<br> - Jerry, how about another drink?<br> - No, I better get back to my girl.<br> - I'm going to score tonight.<br> - Is she worth 20 years?<br> Not her. Brenda.<br> The one sitting next to Wilma.<br> Hi, Joan.<br> I'm sorry I missed the wedding.<br> You look beautiful.<br> So do you.<br> - How'd you come up?<br> - Train.<br> - Nice ride?<br> - Very nice, yeah.<br> What did I tell you, Frank?<br> Weddings bring out the best in everybody.<br> - Why did you miss the wedding?<br> - I wasn't going to come at all.<br> - Did you tell your parents?<br> - Sort of.<br> It's not right to keep their hopes up.<br> You laughed at me<br> when I prayed to St. Rocco.<br> He's the saint of fixing things.<br> And he knows<br> that no matter what Ritchie says...<br> that deep down in his heart he loves Joan,<br> and he'll always love her.<br> We'll see.<br> Jerry, I don't know if it's the champagne,<br> the wedding ceremony...<br> Susan and Michael,<br> but do you feel what I feel?<br> I felt it in New York.<br> Jerry, I hoped you would,<br> but I never dreamed-<br> - I know. Yes.<br> - Do you come from a large family?<br> No, I'm an only child.<br> Coming up in the car,<br> do you remember the little red farmhouse...<br> with the big sheepdog sitting on the lawn?<br> There must have been four<br> or five kids running around.<br> Yes, I remember.<br> That's where we stopped for gas.<br> - Don't you think that's the way to live?<br> - That's nice.<br> - So what's the story, Joan?<br> - Didn't Ritchie tell you?<br> Not the whole story.<br> He said you two<br> were having some compatible difficulties.<br> It's nothing to be ashamed of. Believe me,<br> it happens to the best of people.<br> Shut up, Beatrice.<br> - So what's the story, Joan?<br> - It just comes down to this:<br> Our problems are so overwhelming...<br> because of all the hurts<br> and disillusionments...<br> that have built up over the years.<br> Everybody's got problems.<br> Take a look at this wedding, Joan.<br> Everybody's carefree<br> and having the time of their lives.<br> Anthony and Anita, cheek to cheek.<br> Anthony has not said one word to Anita<br> for two years.<br> But they're still together.<br> And David and Loretta kissing.<br> You know what the people<br> in the family say about David.<br> That he's a little funny.<br> You know what I mean? Peculiar?<br> We don't really think he is.<br> It's just his way...<br> to lock himself up in his room<br> all day Sunday and play with his cats.<br> - Who's to say the man's a degenerate?<br> - Or worse.<br> - But they're still together.<br> - Carmel and Vinny hugging.<br> When Vinny and Carmel first got married...<br> they lived with Vinny's parents<br> because he was out of work a lot...<br> and Carmel was always being picked on<br> by Vinny's mother.<br> She used to blame Carmel<br> for Vinny's laziness.<br> One night, Carmel told Vinny...<br> that if his mother made one more remark,<br> she was going to smack her.<br> And Vinny started yelling,<br> "Don't you dare lay a hand on her. "<br> Carmel said, "Go to hell, both of you,"<br> and stomped out.<br> Vinny chased her down the block<br> and grabbed her by the hair.<br> And Carmel spit right in Vinny's face.<br> Then he started choking her<br> by the throat over the open window.<br> And the super had to come up<br> and pick Vinny off Carmel.<br> And they're still together.<br> I don't want somebody pointing<br> to Joan and me in a couple of years...<br> telling some miserable story ending with<br> "But they're still together. "<br> You understand?<br> - So what's the story, Joan?<br> - Won't you ever give up?<br> - Not till I get the story.<br> - My birthday, for instance.<br> - Do we have to go through that again?<br> - What about your birthday?<br> I asked Ritchie<br> to get me a book for my birthday.<br> - What kind of book?<br> - It was a book about Spain.<br> You know, with colored photographs.<br> - I've always had this big thing about Spain.<br> - They don't get divorced in Spain.<br> A book, to me, means love...<br> because when you give a book<br> about a romantic place...<br> it's like saying that all the days of your<br> life should be as romantic as Spain...<br> and surrounded by a cover of happiness.<br> So I mentioned to Ritchie that I wanted it.<br> That's all she talked about day and night<br> for a month.<br> You always forget my birthdays.<br> I reminded you, that's all.<br> Maybe I felt like getting you<br> something better than a book.<br> - Yes, but this time I wanted a book.<br> - So what did you get her for her birthday?<br> - Nothing. I forgot what day it was.<br> - You always forget.<br> Frank, you're the same way.<br> Maybe you make such<br> a big thing out of it that I want to forget.<br> - I can't see the logic in that.<br> - I said, "Be sure to get me a can opener. "<br> I got you the book, anyway, didn't I?<br> I got her the book, anyway, didn't I?<br> For Christ's sake!<br> What I'm trying to find out is,<br> what's the story?<br> I see the party's petering out.<br> - Jerry, do you know-<br> - Yes.<br> Do you know where Mike and Susan<br> are going on their honeymoon?<br> Isle of Aruba.<br> Aruba's all right.<br> I personally like Trinidad.<br> Trinidad?<br> What are you doing?<br> It's these new locks. This is my room.<br> This is my bed.<br> That's my rug and my chair.<br> - Are you close with your family?<br> - My family?<br> I see my family on holidays, weekends.<br> I love a man that loves his mother.<br> Mother? I love my mother.<br> Do I love my mother.<br> I think we should go back to the wedding.<br> Back to the wedding?<br> Why? They won't miss us.<br> Did you read The Prophet by Khalil Gibran?<br> Yes. I know.<br> "I am you, you are me, we are one. "<br> I think it's too soon for us<br> to be one, Jerry.<br> When two people feel about each other<br> the way we feel about each other...<br> it's never too soon to be one.<br> - You think I'm being too middle-class?<br> - You said it.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Positive.<br> - Let's go to my room!<br> - What?<br> - Let's go to my room.<br> - What for?<br> I just feel freer there.<br> Somebody might walk in on us.<br> Nobody's going to walk in on us.<br> I have the door locked from the inside.<br> I just don't feel I can let it go here<br> the way it wants to be let go.<br> All right. We'll go where you can let it go.<br> Yes. Let's go.<br> - Okay. I'll go first.<br> - Okay. You go first.<br> Wait five minutes and then come.<br> Put your jacket on.<br> And don't turn on the light<br> until I'm out the door.<br> All right. Five minutes.<br> Why do we fight?<br> I don't know, honey. We must be crazy.<br> We've got so much going for us.<br> We really love each other.<br> What makes us do it?<br> - We should be like this all the time.<br> - Yeah, I guess you're right.<br> I can't think of any married couple<br> that has as much going for them as we do.<br> What makes us fight like that?<br> We should try to remember<br> so it never happens again.<br> I think it all started<br> when you said I was faggy.<br> Did I say that?<br> You know I think you're the most<br> masculine man I ever met.<br> I guess I was just hurt<br> because you called me Willy.<br> You must admit that it's really butch<br> to call somebody faggy.<br> You shouldn't have told me<br> you were dynamite with other women.<br> But you had just implied I was impotent.<br> Yes, but you said all-<br> All I'm interested in is getting mine.<br> Aren't you?<br> Aren't you?<br> You see, honey,<br> that's the kind of thing that starts it off.<br> You going tit for tat.<br> - I'm not going tit for tat.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> Stop it, John.<br> Want to know why you can't stand<br> for me to have the last word?<br> Because you seem to have forgotten...<br> that I am the man<br> and you are just the woman...<br> and the man is the boss.<br> Says who?<br> - Says you, the day we were married.<br> - I was just humoring you.<br> I said if it was so important to you,<br> I would let you be the boss.<br> What do you mean,<br> you would let me be the boss?<br> - I am the boss.<br> - Don't be juvenile. There is no boss.<br> - I'm the boss, and you know it.<br> - There is no boss, and that's final.<br> And I don't want<br> to hear another word about it.<br> We are equal.<br> - You and I are equal?<br> - That's right.<br> - Come on, equal. Put them up.<br> - What?<br> Come on, I'll knock you right off.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't...<br> - Come on, who's the boss?<br> - Will you stop it?<br> - Who's the boss?<br> - There's no boss.<br> - Who's the boss?<br> - I am.<br> - Who's the boss?<br> - You're hurting me.<br> You're going to wake up the child.<br> - Who's the boss?<br> - You can torture me, but I won't say it.<br> - Who's the boss?<br> - You are.<br> - Let go of me.<br> - And who won?<br> You did.<br> You shithead.<br> Who is it?<br> - It's me.<br> - Who?<br> Brenda, will you let me in? It's Jerry.<br> Brenda, I want you.<br> Do you think we're doing the right thing?<br> Yes, we're doing the right thing.<br> - Will there be a victim?<br> - What?<br> Did you read<br> Kurt Vonnegut's The Sirens of Titan?<br> I didn't have a chance to.<br> He says, "I was the victim<br> of a series of accidents, as are we all. "<br> - Will there be a victim with us?<br> - No, there'll be no victim.<br> - Could you help out a little here?<br> - Jerry, this isn't right.<br> - The middle of a wedding.<br> - That's what makes it so exciting.<br> - Then let's go back to your room.<br> - What?<br> - Let's go back to your room.<br> - What for?<br> I don't want anyone seeing you<br> come out of my room in the morning.<br> They'll think we spent the night together.<br> What are they going to think<br> if they see you coming out of my room?<br> That's different.<br> I'm never sure what happened...<br> when I see a girl come out of a man's room.<br> Please, Jerry. For me. For Brenda.<br> But we're here already.<br> Brenda, take it easy.<br> I'm not happy, Johnny.<br> The only woman you ever loved<br> is your mother.<br> Watch it, Wilma.<br> It seems to me, if you're so<br> frightened of being castrated...<br> you should go to the source of your fear<br> and then work it out with her.<br> That's right. Then you and your father...<br> should make a special call<br> on your grandmother.<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - Away from your mouth.<br> - No, you don't.<br> - Yeah? Try and stop me.<br> - Get away from me.<br> - Johnny, please.<br> Will you get away from me?<br> Get away from me.<br> - Was it something I said?<br> - Come on. Will you knock it off?<br> Please, let's work this out.<br> Look, I'm upset.<br> Are you kidding?<br> Will you quit acting helpless?<br> - You're like a rock.<br> - Okay, then get out of my life.<br> - Get out.<br> - Don't worry, I'm going.<br> - Soon as I get the key in the door.<br> - All right. Go.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> No, you're not going-<br> Why did you make me hit you?<br> I didn't want to hit you.<br> I never hit a woman in my life<br> till I met you.<br> Johnny, I'm sorry. I feel awful.<br> Just awful. I'm sorry. Do you forgive me?<br> You started it. You called me a shithead.<br> I didn't mean it. Please.<br> Please forgive me.<br> I'll never be able to forgive myself.<br> It's my sister's wedding.<br> We were going to be so happy.<br> I ruined everything.<br> Please forgive me.<br> - Who's the man?<br> - You are.<br> - And who's the woman?<br> - Me.<br> And who's the boss?<br> I really think you should give that up.<br> It's a very baby thing.<br> If you want me to have a happy marriage<br> and you want to be my friend...<br> then you've got to acknowledge<br> that the man is the stronger one.<br> You have to surrender to me.<br> Then I'll be king of the jungle.<br> But as king I will rule tenderly.<br> But I can't rule tenderly<br> until you surrender to me first.<br> Okay, I surrender. Now make up with me.<br> Isn't he adorable?<br> You're my great, big, strong...<br> teddy bear king...<br> what I loves...<br> and I'm the little surrendering baby bear...<br> what you loves.<br> What?<br> Okay.<br> Give a woof. Come on.<br> Does you woof me?<br> Honey, I woof, woof you.<br> "Sometimes I look at a man<br> and he's a chair, a rock, a tree. "<br> - What? - It's what Monica Vitti<br> said in L'Avventura.<br> Let's rest.<br> What for? We haven't done anything.<br> Please. I'd like a moment<br> to reflect about things.<br> What things?<br> Would you stroke my hair?<br> Not like that.<br> Like this.<br> Feels nice.<br> - Jerry?<br> - Yes?<br> - Shall I tell you how I feel?<br> - Yes, Brenda.<br> I feel that I'm queen of the universe.<br> The waves part, and they engulf me...<br> and the sea foam is warm.<br> Kiss me.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Warm. Warm like the sea foam.<br> - Then tell me.<br> - What?<br> - That I am yours.<br> - You are mine.<br> Thank you. Say it again.<br> Look, can we stop all this talking?<br> What is all this talking? Let's just do it.<br> - Do it?<br> - Come on.<br> - Do what? I don't follow.<br> - What do you mean, you don't follow?<br> - You know what I mean.<br> - No, I don't. What?<br> - Sex.<br> - Sex?<br> That's all it is to you? Sex?<br> I love you. I opened myself to you...<br> and you led me to believe<br> we had something good, something real.<br> What do you mean, I led you to believe?<br> I just thought<br> we were going to have a little fun.<br> What about<br> the little red farmhouse and the sheepdog?<br> - What about Trinidad?<br> - Look, let's forget the whole thing.<br> Okay, let's forget the whole thing.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you for the sobering<br> and degrading experience.<br> Why don't I ever have any luck? Either<br> I get a girl, she gives me the brush...<br> or she gives me a tease,<br> or I wind up with some nut.<br> What's the matter with me?<br> - Can I speak frankly?<br> - Yes.<br> It's obvious that you're just a slave<br> to your erections.<br> And what about you?<br> You don't love me. You never loved me.<br> What you're in love with is this wedding,<br> and any usher would do.<br> I've been a bridesmaid many times.<br> I was once even the maid of honor.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> This is the closest I've ever gotten<br> to any usher.<br> - You mean that?<br> - Sure I mean that.<br> You're not just any usher.<br> You're special.<br> - I am?<br> - Sure.<br> What about me?<br> What about you?<br> - Aren't I special?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, you're special. You're very special.<br> So what happened?<br> You got something on the side...<br> - and she found out about it?<br> - No, Pop.<br> Come on. You can tell me.<br> I never told you this before,<br> but I strayed, too, when I was young.<br> Don't get me wrong, I never looked for it...<br> but sometimes you're walking along<br> and it falls in your lap.<br> - Look, Pop, that's not the reason.<br> - It happens to everybody.<br> I love your mother,<br> but sometimes you need a little stimulation.<br> Thank God she never felt that way.<br> But there was this one time<br> that your mother found out about it.<br> Her stupid sister Pauline<br> opened up her big mouth and told her.<br> She walked out on me for four days,<br> but she came back.<br> Where was she going to go?<br> So what happened, Joan?<br> Some girl vamped him?<br> - No.<br> - Joan, you can tell me...<br> because all men stray, even Frank.<br> It's a mortal sin, but it happens.<br> I left him for a few days, but I came back.<br> - Where was I going to go?<br> - Mother, Ritchie would never cheat on me.<br> So what, Joan? Tell me, please.<br> Ever since I was 15,<br> I loved Ritchie from afar.<br> And the whole time we went together,<br> I was just floating on air...<br> and we had so much fun together...<br> because we both loved the beach<br> and things.<br> We were always kissing and hugging.<br> Everyone said how great we looked<br> on the dance floor.<br> So I really thought we'd get married<br> and live happily ever after...<br> but I guess we just weren't that lucky.<br> I knew it was the real thing,<br> because I loved everything about him.<br> I loved the way he moved.<br> Sometimes I'd just spend hours and hours<br> and watch him move around.<br> And his hair...<br> You're going to think I'm crazy...<br> but I loved the way<br> his hair smelled like raisins.<br> When he kissed me, I never told him this...<br> but the best part about being in his arms...<br> was that I could get a<br> good whiff of his hair.<br> I don't know if it's me<br> or Ritchie that's changed...<br> but it's just no big deal anymore...<br> to feel him or smell him.<br> I don't know, Pop.<br> I was too young when I got married.<br> I didn't know who I was or what I wanted.<br> When we first got married, we cared.<br> We're strangers.<br> We're all strangers...<br> but after a while you get used to it.<br> You become deeper strangers.<br> - That's a sort of love.<br> - No, that's habit. I want more than that.<br> - More, more, everybody wants more.<br> - Why don't they go out and get it?<br> - Because there is no more.<br> - There's got to be more.<br> More.<br> You think I don't understand<br> what you're talking about, don't you?<br> I understand.<br> There were times with your mother<br> when I thought...<br> maybe I didn't do justice to myself.<br> You know what I mean, Ritchie?<br> I love your mother, but I never thought<br> she was as intelligent as I am.<br> That used to bother me a lot.<br> Everybody wants to be married<br> to somebody on his own level.<br> A couple of years<br> before I married your mother...<br> I met this schoolteacher.<br> Her name was Mary Rose.<br> A real society girl.<br> We had everything in common,<br> the same interests...<br> the same mentality.<br> And I used to think that<br> if I had married Mary Rose...<br> maybe I wouldn't have yelled<br> and screamed so much around the house.<br> I figured that...<br> I would have been a different person<br> if I had married her.<br> But she wouldn't go out with me...<br> so I married your mother.<br> When I married Frank,<br> he was very handsome.<br> And clean. He was so clean.<br> That's why it came as a big shock to me<br> on my wedding night to find out...<br> what a physical person he was.<br> You know what I'm talking about, Joan?<br> - Sex.<br> - You said it, not me.<br> It's very hard for me<br> to talk about these things.<br> I was so nauseous on my wedding night<br> with you-know-who...<br> but I didn't say a word.<br> I just ran into the bathroom<br> and locked the door...<br> because I don't like to make a scene.<br> - You mean, you never enjoyed sex?<br> - What's to enjoy?<br> Love isn't physical. Love is spiritual.<br> Like the great love that Ingrid Bergman had<br> for Bing Crosby...<br> in The Bells of St. Mary<br> when she was a nun, and he was a priest...<br> and they loved each other from afar.<br> But Frank didn't want to know.<br> It's very hard for a man<br> to understand how a woman feels inside...<br> although I tried to understand Frank.<br> Not that there's that much there<br> to understand.<br> That's why I was so hurt when he strayed.<br> But you know me, Joan.<br> I always try to look on the bright side.<br> I just said to myself:<br> "At least she's the one<br> who'll be nauseous now. "<br> Your mother and I had what you'd call...<br> different sexuality outlooks.<br> Don't get me wrong, nothing abnormal.<br> We had two sons, right?<br> But she used to lock herself<br> in the bathroom at night.<br> That's when I would think about Mary Rose.<br> You know, Ritchie,<br> the best thing about the past is...<br> you forget what it was<br> that could have made you happy.<br> And for the past 15, 20 years...<br> your mother and I have been<br> like I said: content.<br> - You got to find things in common.<br> - Like what, Pop?<br> Like food, for instance.<br> Your mother and I are interested<br> in various types of food.<br> A roasted chicken,<br> a leg of lamb smothered with onions...<br> a Yankee pot roast with lots of brown gravy<br> and little baby baked potatoes.<br> - There's always something to talk about.<br> - What?<br> Like who just got married, who died...<br> who just had a baby,<br> how much we should give.<br> Marriage is a wonderful thing...<br> if you can just learn<br> to enjoy your wife for whatever she is.<br> They're giving the busta, Frank.<br> Better get back, Pop. It's late.<br> - We'll talk some more, huh?<br> - Yeah, we'll talk some more.<br> I've got something I've been saving up<br> for this moment. It's your wedding present.<br> It might interest you<br> to know that there's $1,850 in there.<br> You might recall<br> that when your brother got married...<br> I only give him $1,500,<br> but that was in 1964.<br> Since then,<br> you got to figure that since 1964...<br> there's been what you'd call an inflation.<br> So this way I'm giving you<br> the same thing as I gave Ritchie.<br> - You got it?<br> - Thanks, Pop.<br> - Let's split.<br> - Yeah.<br> Was it worth it?<br> I'll let you know later.<br> Mom, we're leaving.<br> Be good to my little boy.<br> I dreamed, but I never realized.<br> I hope you're not disappointed.<br> Should I tell you how I feel?<br> The waves have subsided,<br> but I am still full.<br> And you?<br> Do you believe:<br> "I am what I do, not what I say. "<br> Albert Camus.<br> Or "I love, therefore I do. " Bishop Pike.<br> - I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open.<br> - Then shut them. Take a nap.<br> - No, it's all right.<br> - Go on.<br> It's very hard for me to sleep<br> when there's someone in my bed.<br> Sleep is evidently more important to you<br> than the act of oneness.<br> I sensed the futility and doom of it all<br> when we first met.<br> We both sensed it.<br> - I suppose that's what drew us together.<br> - I'm sure of it.<br> Maybe I gave too much too soon. Is that it?<br> I should have held back more.<br> You wouldn't have judged me so harshly.<br> Brenda, I don't judge you.<br> - You're going to give me a call?<br> - Sure.<br> - You still have my number?<br> - Yes.<br> What is it?<br> I wrote it down. I have it written here.<br> I think it began with a six<br> or with an area code.<br> What is it?<br> Seven...<br> two...<br> eight...<br> - Phyllis, that wasn't so bad, was it?<br> - It was a nice wedding. Thank you.<br> Take care of my little girl.<br> Now each of you<br> has a faithful companion for life.<br> Flowers.<br> - Susan, here I am.<br> - Over here. To me.<br> Poor Kathy.<br> This is evidently a hard time for her.<br> Be an angel. See if you can't cheer her up.<br> - Why don't you do it?<br> - No, you go.<br> You have a way of comforting her.<br> - Now?<br> - Now.<br> I love you truly<br> Truly, dear<br> Kathy, are you in there?<br> I can't bear to see you unhappy.<br> Will you let me in?<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Goodbye, Hal.<br> I can't go on like this anymore.<br> You've got to tell Bernice<br> about us right now...<br> or I don't know what I'll do.<br> Sit down.<br> Kathy, you mean a lot to me,<br> but let me tell you something about myself.<br> I could go to Bernice and<br> tell her about us...<br> and maybe she would forgive you...<br> even though she'd certainly never speak<br> to me again.<br> But that's not important.<br> What is important...<br> You have every right<br> to want something more...<br> than what I've been giving you,<br> just as Bernice has every right...<br> but here it is in a nutshell.<br> I'm the kind of man<br> who, when confronted with the fact...<br> that I've been married<br> to the same woman for 30 years...<br> who has given me two wonderful children...<br> it becomes progressively<br> more difficult for me to know that...<br> I've given her any more unhappiness<br> than I've already given her.<br> - What I'm trying to say is-<br> - That you'll never leave Bernice.<br> That we'll never see each other,<br> or have each other...<br> - or hold each other in our arms again.<br> - Not necessarily.<br> What are you trying to say?<br> Are you going to tell Bernice about us<br> or not?<br> Kathy, it's not that simple. You see...<br> You, Bernice, and I are<br> three of us in a boat.<br> It's my boat and it's your lake,<br> but Bernice has the oars.<br> Phil has asked me to marry him, Hal.<br> Phil has asked you to marry him?<br> Have you been fooling around with Phil?<br> I could never, not when<br> I'm in love with you.<br> You must have done something<br> for him to ask you to marry him.<br> Did he kiss you?<br> Yes. I kissed him.<br> Did he touch your breast?<br> - Did he touch your breast?<br> - Yes, Hal, but I...<br> Why, Kathy? Why?<br> Didn't you tell me to go out with other men?<br> - Yes, but-<br> - He wouldn't go out with me anymore...<br> if I didn't at least let him do something.<br> Life stinks.<br> Nobody can ever be happy.<br> - You're not happy. Bernice is not happy.<br> - I think I can make Phil happy.<br> - Screw Phil.<br> - You don't mean that.<br> No, I don't mean that. It's just that...<br> every time I think everything's worked out,<br> something complicates things.<br> Now there's Phil's happiness<br> to worry about.<br> - All right, what did you tell him?<br> - I told him that I have to think about it.<br> There's nothing to think about.<br> You can't marry Phil.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because I have too much pride...<br> to go sneaking around corners<br> with a married woman.<br> - What have I been doing?<br> - That's different.<br> - I was married before I met you.<br> - But I have nothing.<br> I can't go on like this. There's no end.<br> If you don't tell Bernice about us<br> right after the wedding...<br> I'm going to marry Phil.<br> I see. You're going<br> to force me to make the decision for you.<br> You have to make your own decision...<br> just like Bernice has<br> to make her own decision...<br> and Phil has to make his own decision.<br> What about you, Hal?<br> Don't you have to make a decision?<br> - I have made my decision.<br> - What have you decided?<br> I've decided to try to find a new way...<br> to help Bernice<br> to find the strength to leave me...<br> yet giving you the option<br> to end it all by marrying Phil.<br> If Bernice isn't aware enough<br> to make the move that's right for her...<br> and if you can't call on your resources<br> to resist me...<br> then responsibility rests not with me...<br> not with you, Kathy, not with Bernice,<br> but with Phil.<br> - Bye-bye, Joe.<br> - Arrivederci.<br> - Ciao, Frank.<br> - Ciao.<br> Good night, Mom and Dad. I'm leaving.<br> Joan, you let Ritchie drive you back<br> to New York.<br> Okay, Mother.<br> You can buy her a new book.<br> So what was Joan's story?<br> Ritchie's hair stopped<br> smelling like raisins.<br> That's it? That's her story?<br> - And she was shocked that you've strayed.<br> - For crying out loud.<br> - What did you have to tell her that for?<br> - It came out in passing.<br> - Why does she have to know our business?<br> - I was trying to make a point.<br> To err is human, to forgive divine.<br> All right.<br> - Arrivederci, Bea.<br> - Arrivederci, Pauline.<br> - Stupid Pauline.<br> - What are we going to do?<br> What can you do?<br> You live and learn.<br> - You got to take the good with the bad.<br> - What can you do?<br> - You live and learn.<br> - You raise a boy.<br> - You teach him values.<br> - That stupid Pauline.<br> Teach him a family.<br> - You got to take the good with the bad.<br> - Life is for the living.<br> I could have broken her head.<br> - I can understand her wanting to leave.<br> - That's how life is.<br> But I can't understand her leaving.<br> I think I'll have my wedding cake now.<br> I don't understand how you spend<br> half your life in the bathroom.<br> You followed him there...<br> - and shot him from behind a tree.<br> - That's enough. That story is ridiculous.<br> You'll make a fool of yourself.<br> A love-smitten analyst<br> playing a dream detective?<br> There've been no dreams for days.<br> You going to watch television<br> on our honeymoon night?<br> It's almost over.<br> You'll be identified by the man<br> that arrived.<br> There are people who saw you<br> on the train...<br> I'm not getting married.<br> Remember when I said to you,<br> "Mike, if I ask you to marry me...<br> "can I take it back if I want to?"<br> You said I could, didn't you?<br> I'm taking it back. That's all.<br> Taking it back.<br> Dr. Peterson was a rather stupid woman.<br>
