                        You are now qualified<br> for evangelical work...<br> under the auspices of the Belgian<br> Committee of the Messengers of the Faith.<br> May the Lord guide you<br> and sustain you in all your ways.<br> Congratulations, Dr. Bosman.<br> A very creditable group of young men.<br> Now about this<br> other young man, Dr. Bosman.<br> Are you sure he's quite hopeless?<br> Gentlemen, I've trained a great<br> many students in evangelical work...<br> but never in my life<br> have I come across a case quite like this.<br> He is completely unable<br> to speak extemporary.<br> He prepares long and obscure sermons<br> which he's unable to memorize...<br> and has to read<br> like a stumbling and inarticulate child.<br> Now, gentlemen, can we send<br> that kind of man out into the field...<br> to represent our society?<br> Dr. Peeters, I think that's conclusive.<br> Dr. Bosman, ask him to come in, please.<br> Mr. Van Gogh, we have Dr. Bosman's<br> report on your progress here.<br> - In view of what he's told us...<br> - You understand...<br> if your teacher feels<br> that you're unqualified...<br> this committee cannot give you<br> an appointment.<br> We regret it more than we can say.<br> Gentlemen, I think that concludes<br> Committee business for today.<br> Mr. Van Gogh, do you feel that the<br> Committee were unjust in their decision?<br> - No, sir.<br> - We did what we had to do...<br> in view of your records.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Come here.<br> Your father is a minister, is he not?<br> I'm not trying to put myself<br> on a level with my father.<br> I only hoped in some way<br> to follow in his footsteps.<br> Yet, until a year ago...<br> you showed no inclination or desire<br> to follow your father's calling.<br> Believe me, this is something I have to do.<br> I want to help the unfortunates.<br> I want to bring them the word of God.<br> Even if I'm not qualified,<br> there must be some way I can serve.<br> Isn't there any place for me?<br> Somewhere no one else wants to go?<br> I'll do anything. Only use me. Use me!<br> Come here.<br> - Do you know this part of the country?<br> - No.<br> It's a coal-mining region, the Borinage.<br> There exist no more miserable people<br> on the face of the earth...<br> than the miners who live there.<br> If you really mean what you said<br> about wanting to help the unfortunates...<br> here's your chance.<br> "The heart that seeks God...<br> "has more storms than any others.<br> "Life is a struggle here below.<br> "Yet out of our sufferings...<br> "God teaches us higher things.<br> "He wills..."<br> "He wills that man should live humbly...<br> "and go through life<br> not reaching after lofty aims...<br> "but fitting himself to the lowly<br> and learning from the Gospels...<br> "to be meek, simple of heart."<br> Father, we pray to thee<br> to keep us from evil and despair.<br> Feed us with the bread<br> that does not perish, which is thy word.<br> O Lord, amen.<br> Mister!<br> - I don't know what your name is, but...<br> - Ducrucq.<br> Why did you leave?<br> Did I say something wrong?<br> I saw you leave.<br> What did I say that offended you?<br> Just because it's Sunday...<br> you don't expect us to listen<br> to the kind of pious bilge...<br> - you gave us just now.<br> - Bilge?<br> Look, I worked all week on that sermon.<br> I meant every word of it.<br> Listen, mister. Every now and then,<br> somebody comes here from the outside...<br> and tries to help us.<br> They mean well. So do you, probably,<br> but that doesn't help us at all, does it?<br> I want to bring you the word of God.<br> - What can I do? Tell me.<br> - I don't know.<br> Help me. Help me<br> to understand you people...<br> to know you. Take me into your homes<br> where you live.<br> We don't live here.<br> We only come here to sleep.<br> Down there, 2,000 feet underground,<br> that's where we live.<br> Can I go down? Take me.<br> - Will you take me down?<br> - Sure, I can arrange it.<br> Be here in the morning when I go to work.<br> At 4:00.<br> I'm trembling inside of me<br> just as much as you are.<br> And I've been going down for 33 years.<br> - How old is that child?<br> - Eleven.<br> - How long has she been working here?<br> - A year.<br> Her father was killed in the explosion.<br> Listen, mister. Every now and then,<br> somebody comes here from the outside...<br> and tries to help us.<br> They mean well. So do you, probably,<br> but that doesn't help us at all, does it?<br> Ducrucq.<br> Come down! Somebody...<br> Why don't you come down<br> and wait with us?<br> What are you waiting for?<br> I've got a blanket in there<br> for one of the wounded, and some bread.<br> What about you?<br> Wait for me.<br> Van Gogh.<br> I see you don't remember us.<br> From the Committee<br> of the Messengers of the Faith.<br> I'm glad you've come. Did you bring<br> food and clothes for the families?<br> - Families?<br> - Another accident?<br> - You didn't know?<br> - I'm sorry to hear it.<br> - Were there many lost?<br> - Six.<br> - Four men, two children, 28 injured.<br> - Terrible.<br> I'll see what we can do.<br> It's unfortunate our visit<br> should have come at this time.<br> But it was Rev. Peeters' wish.<br> The purpose of our coming here<br> is an inspection.<br> Excuse me, gentlemen. I'll be right back.<br> - Just what is the meaning of this?<br> - You receive an allowance.<br> Why have you chosen to live in the most<br> wretched, filthy shack in this village?<br> Because we have no right to spread<br> the word of God to these people...<br> unless we suffer as they do.<br> You yourself are unclean.<br> Your clothes are ragged and dirty.<br> There are people here<br> who have no clothes.<br> Do you mean to tell us<br> you actually sleep on this dirt and straw...<br> like a beast of the field? You,<br> the spiritual leader of the community?<br> I gave my bed to a sick woman<br> who needed it more than I.<br> You are new in this work.<br> I have no doubt you mean well.<br> But by your behavior, you've degraded<br> the dignity of the church...<br> - whose representative you are.<br> - Have you no sense of decency?<br> Don't you understand<br> that if the clergy is to be respected...<br> I don't care to be respected!<br> I'm trying to live like a true Christian.<br> I'm not going to worry about how I sleep.<br> Look at the fresh graves of the children<br> in the cemetery.<br> Scrub floors and pick coal<br> with the women.<br> Get those fine clothes dirty<br> with the blood and sweat of dying miners.<br> Then come here<br> and lecture me about Christianity!<br> Hypocrites!<br> But you must have heard of him.<br> He came here about a year ago<br> as a preacher. Vincent van Gogh.<br> Yes, mister.<br> You'll find him in the little shack.<br> Vincent.<br> Who is it?<br> It's Theo.<br> - Vincent, what have you done to yourself?<br> - Theo.<br> What's happened to you?<br> I was sick for a while,<br> but I'm all right now.<br> Doesn't anyone look after you?<br> - I'd better go and get you some food.<br> - Don't go. Stay and talk.<br> - Where's the nearest place where I can...<br> - Please don't go, Theo.<br> It's been such a long time.<br> What are we going to do about you?<br> Father wrote and asked me<br> to come and find you.<br> - For months he's not heard from you.<br> - There was nothing to tell.<br> What right have you to decide that?<br> Cut yourself off from everybody,<br> even from me.<br> You've become a stranger.<br> You've changed.<br> I haven't changed, Theo.<br> Outwardly, perhaps, but inside me,<br> I still want the same things.<br> What things?<br> The things we talked about<br> in the old days.<br> To be of use, to work,<br> to bring something to the world.<br> Do you think this is the answer?<br> I don't know.<br> We've grown apart, Theo.<br> Look, you found what you wanted in Paris<br> and I'm glad for you.<br> I've found nothing anywhere.<br> I've made one bad start after another.<br> One mess after another.<br> I thought I was on my way here<br> by doing God's work.<br> That was the worst failure of all.<br> But no matter how often I fail,<br> there is something in me.<br> - That I am good for something.<br> - But this is not the way to find it.<br> Hiding away here, wasting your time.<br> You've become an idler.<br> An idler? Yes.<br> But there are two kinds of idlers.<br> There's the man who's idle<br> because he wants to be, out of laziness.<br> How easy that is. I envy him.<br> There's the other kind...<br> the man who's idle in spite of himself.<br> I want nothing but to work.<br> Only, I can't.<br> I'm in a cage, a cage of shame<br> and self-doubt and failure.<br> Somebody believe me.<br> I'm caged. I'm alone.<br> I'm frightened.<br> Vincent, listen to me.<br> When we were children,<br> I used to follow you about.<br> If I was frightened, I'd run to look for you.<br> If I got lost, you'd always come to find me.<br> We're still brothers, we're friends...<br> we can trust one another.<br> That's stronger than any cage.<br> Whatever you do, from now on,<br> wherever you go...<br> promise me, make me part of it.<br> Don't ever cut yourself off from me again.<br> - What is it?<br> - My pipe.<br> Let me take you home...<br> where you can live and be cared for.<br> Until you find your way.<br> Tell me, if you were me...<br> which would you want<br> to have your money in?<br> These are both accredited canvases.<br> Both were exhibited in last year's salon.<br> Perhaps you'd prefer to be left alone<br> for a moment to make your choice.<br> I shall be in the next room.<br> Dear Theo...<br> you were right. It's so good to be home.<br> To live in peace for a time.<br> Once again, thanks to you,<br> life seems precious to me.<br> Something to be valued and loved.<br> Once again I'm working.<br> You know how for years,<br> whenever I saw anything that moved me...<br> I felt the need to draw it.<br> To get it down on paper,<br> no matter how crudely.<br> Now, for the first time,<br> I've begun to wonder...<br> could this be the way for me?<br> A man or a woman at work.<br> Some furrows in a plowed field.<br> A bit of sand, sea, or sky.<br> These are subjects so difficult,<br> and at the same time, so beautiful...<br> that it's worth spending one's whole life...<br> trying to capture the poetry<br> that's hidden in them.<br> Vincent, have you lost all track of time?<br> Father's upset,<br> we're practically through dinner.<br> You go ahead. I just want to finish this.<br> Couldn't you try to be on time<br> just once in a while?<br> Especially with Cousin Kay here.<br> She brought little Jan with her.<br> And, Vincent, try not to argue with Father.<br> Not today.<br> I'm sorry I'm late.<br> Vincent, aren't you going to say hello<br> to your cousin Kay?<br> Hello, cousin.<br> Hello, Kay.<br> You must pardon Vincent.<br> He's so interested in his new work,<br> he forgets where he is sometimes.<br> - Vincent is an artist these days.<br> - Draws on paper.<br> Lovely things: Swamps, woods, people...<br> He's made a drawing of me.<br> He makes us all pose for him.<br> If you don't watch out,<br> he'll make you pose, too, cousin.<br> And Jan.<br> You should see the way<br> he makes people look.<br> Vincent, you're looking at me<br> as though you've never seen me before.<br> It's been a long time.<br> Not since before Vos died.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I guess I shouldn't have mentioned it.<br> Even though it's been almost a year.<br> Vincent.<br> One doesn't measure such things<br> in weeks and months, Vincent.<br> No, of course not. See, I only meant that...<br> I was gonna write to you, Cousin Kay,<br> but I'm not very good at those things...<br> and then so much time went by that I...<br> Jan's being very quiet.<br> I hope he's not getting up to any mischief.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Vincent, really...<br> - Couldn't you see how she felt?<br> You know how it was with her and Vos?<br> It's not right to grieve that long.<br> God didn't intend the living<br> to mourn forever.<br> I hardly think you're the best judge<br> of God's intentions.<br> Do you realize you haven't been to church<br> once since you got back?<br> You, the minister's son.<br> What do you think<br> they're saying in the village?<br> I act out of my beliefs, Father.<br> Not because I want to please the village.<br> I happen not to believe<br> in the God or the clergymen.<br> For me, he's as dead as a doornail.<br> Children, if you've finished,<br> leave the table, please.<br> Go into the other room.<br> Vincent, before the children?<br> Do you realize what you said?<br> Yes, Mother. But I must say what I feel.<br> I'm not an atheist. I do believe in God.<br> A God of love, Father, and I believe<br> there are many ways to serve him.<br> One man does it from a pulpit,<br> another through a book or a painting.<br> Let's not discuss it.<br> I'm sorry, Father,<br> but I was just telling you my opinion.<br> Did you have a good morning<br> in the fields, Vincent?<br> Like any other.<br> Do you feel the drawing's going well?<br> You work so hard and...<br> I can't help noticing<br> you go over and over your drawings...<br> and often as not, you throw them away.<br> What Mother means is, we'd hate<br> to see you keep struggling, Vincent...<br> only to realize in the end,<br> it was just another failure.<br> Maybe he could visit Cousin Mauve<br> in The Hague. He's a successful artist.<br> Ask him his opinion of your drawings.<br> I'm sure he'd be glad to help you.<br> I'm not ready to show my work to Mauve.<br> When I am, I'll go to him.<br> I'm sorry, Vincent.<br> - How's Jan?<br> - He's all right. Thank you.<br> I'm glad you're here, Kay.<br> Please, Theo, send more paper<br> and drawing ink.<br> I'm afraid I quickly used up<br> what you sent last month.<br> As I work at my drawings day after day...<br> what seemed unattainable before...<br> is now gradually becoming possible.<br> Slowly, I'm learning<br> to observe and measure.<br> I don't stand quite so helpless<br> before nature any longer.<br> Come on, Jan, you rascal.<br> I know there's still something<br> harsh and stiff in my style.<br> Although, to tell the truth, I believe<br> the presence of Kay here this summer...<br> is beginning to have a softening influence<br> on my work.<br> Time for your nap, now.<br> There we go. Cover you up.<br> He fell asleep almost as soon<br> as I put him down. Thank you.<br> He's getting to be such a boy.<br> It's been a wonderful summer<br> for him here.<br> It's been a wonderful summer.<br> - How did it go today? Well?<br> - When you're with me, it always goes well.<br> I'm glad, Vincent.<br> You work so hard.<br> I see your light on often,<br> halfway through the night.<br> There's so much to learn,<br> not only about drawing, but people.<br> How they feel and think,<br> the world they live in.<br> Before you can paint them,<br> you have to know that, too.<br> So I read everything<br> I can get my hands on.<br> Dickens, Zola, Michelet.<br> You know what Michelet says?<br> "Blessed is the man<br> who's found his worth...<br> "and one woman to love."<br> - I need love, Kay.<br> - Of course you do.<br> I need it to be myself,<br> to be able to breathe it.<br> I want a home. I want children.<br> Vos felt the same way. He made<br> Jan and me the center of his existence.<br> - Nothing else counted for him...<br> - Stop talking about Vos. He's dead.<br> And we're alive, Kay. In the present.<br> The present.<br> - I love you, Kay.<br> - No.<br> Listen to me,<br> we're both alone in the world.<br> We need each other.<br> Look, we'll have a home.<br> We'll be happy. I promise you.<br> No.<br> In God's name, don't be frightened.<br> I'm only saying I want to marry you.<br> To be your husband, and a father to Jan.<br> No. Never!<br> No. Never.<br> I tell you, Theo, this thing threatens me.<br> Love is something so strong, so real...<br> that it's as impossible to quench it...<br> as it is for a man to take his own life.<br> I must see her face again<br> and speak to her once more.<br> - I'd like to see Miss Kay.<br> - I'm afraid she's out, sir.<br> No, you can't go in there, sir.<br> The family's at dinner.<br> He pushed his way in, sir.<br> I see now what people mean when<br> they complain about your bad manners.<br> - Where's Kay?<br> - She's not here.<br> She's visiting friends.<br> - Vincent, please, sit down.<br> - She was just sitting here.<br> Can't you understand<br> a simple word like "no"?<br> Don't you realize what it meant<br> when Kay returned your letters unopened?<br> May I speak to Kay, please?<br> My dear, will you leave us alone, please?<br> Must you persist in the face of everything?<br> Try to be reasonable, Vincent.<br> Even if Kay returned your love...<br> how could you possibly hope<br> to provide a home for her?<br> You haven't earned money in a long time.<br> - You don't even have...<br> - lf a man loves, he lives.<br> If he lives, he works.<br> If he works, he has bread.<br> You think I'm a tramp?<br> I'll be penniless all my life?<br> - It's not just a question of money...<br> - Listen to me!<br> All I ask is a chance to show Kay my love.<br> To help her understand<br> why she must love me.<br> Surely you've been in love.<br> You know what agonies a man can suffer...<br> Agonies? Are you such a weakling...<br> that you can't stand the little pain<br> of a disappointment in love?<br> Do you have to whimper about it?<br> What do you know about pain?<br> I've seen agonies<br> that you've never dreamed of.<br> Let me talk to Kay for as long as<br> I can keep my hand in this flame.<br> Vincent!<br> Have you gone out of your mind?<br> - Do you hear me whimpering?<br> - Listen to me, my boy.<br> I'd let you talk to Kay<br> to your heart's content, but for one thing.<br> She refuses to see you again, ever.<br> I don't believe it.<br> She said that your persistence<br> disgusted her.<br> There are some things<br> that can't be controlled by wishes.<br> Love is one of them.<br> I'm sorry.<br> But did she say I disgusted her?<br> Yes.<br> - Did she actually say that?<br> - Yes.<br> All right, I'm sorry, too.<br> - I'll be going.<br> - Where are you staying?<br> - Would you like to spend the night here?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Lf Kay leaves the house...<br> - Let me take care of your hand.<br> - Take care of yourself, Vincent.<br> - Our love to your family.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, boy.<br> Come on. Let's get out of here.<br> Come on. If you want to sit here,<br> that's all right.<br> More wine?<br> - On credit?<br> - No.<br> You all right?<br> I'm sick. I'm tired. Just leave me alone.<br> Everything's rotten. Now I understand<br> why people drown themselves.<br> - Don't say things like that.<br> - Why not?<br> - Suicide's a terrible thing.<br> - What do you know about it?<br> What are you, anyway? A working man?<br> - Yes.<br> - You don't talk like one.<br> Thanks for the brandy.<br> I'm a laundress,<br> when I have the strength to scrub.<br> And when I haven't, I look for easier work.<br> I have a baby to feed.<br> He's at home with my mother.<br> - Where's your husband?<br> - What husband?<br> I've been at the tubs all day.<br> They were supposed to pay me tonight<br> but they put me off till tomorrow.<br> - Can't your mother help you?<br> - She's helped plenty.<br> She's taught me all I know.<br> Can I have another?<br> Here. Put this in your pocket instead.<br> - I'm only sorry it isn't more.<br> - Who bit your hand?<br> - I burned it.<br> - Let me see it.<br> What were you trying to do?<br> Fry it for dinner?<br> - I'll get something for it.<br> - It'll be all right.<br> Got any oil or butter<br> in this cockroach trap?<br> We sell drinks, not food.<br> It's a bad burn. Come home with me.<br> - I'll dress it for you before it gets worse.<br> - Thank you. It'll heal.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You're afraid to be seen with me?<br> This is a woman, Theo,<br> who is far from young, far from pretty...<br> but she was good to me, and kind.<br> She's evidently had a great deal of trouble<br> and a hard life...<br> and there's nothing at all<br> distinguished or unusual about her.<br> We talked about all sorts of things. ;<br> her life, her troubles, her poverty...<br> her health, her loneliness.<br> If you had nothing at all,<br> it'd make no difference.<br> Since you came over and talked to me,<br> I don't feel alone anymore.<br> I don't know how to say it.<br> The clergymen would call us sinners.<br> Is it a sin to love, Theo,<br> to be in need of love?<br> Not to be able to live without love?<br> Cousin Mauve.<br> Vincent. I'm sorry to put off seeing you...<br> but we artists have to be selfish,<br> you know.<br> We have to save ourselves.<br> After all, with each painting,<br> we die a little.<br> What have you there?<br> I'm trying to draw.<br> I was wondering if you'd be willing<br> to help me.<br> I wouldn't ask much. Just let me<br> watch you work now and then.<br> And sometimes, when you're resting...<br> if you would look at my things<br> and tell me my mistakes.<br> You think that's not asking much?<br> But these are just copying exercises.<br> Don't you have anything of your own?<br> You've been out at the beach<br> at Scheveningen.<br> Don't be in such a hurry,<br> seascapes are difficult.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> You know, I expected to find you a dullard.<br> I was wrong.<br> They're clumsy, most of them,<br> but I can see what you're getting at.<br> And that you've worked.<br> Yes, that...<br> Tell me something.<br> What kind of an artist do you want to be?<br> I want to create things that touch people.<br> I want to move them so they say,<br> "He feels deeply and tenderly."<br> That's fine.<br> But before you can move people...<br> you first have to learn your business.<br> It needs skill as well as heart.<br> Tell me something.<br> - Have you ever worked in color?<br> - No.<br> You better start working right away<br> in watercolors and oil.<br> It'll help your drawing.<br> - I don't know anything about color.<br> - I will teach you.<br> We'll work together here.<br> - Cousin Mauve...<br> - No.<br> When I'm less tired.<br> Now, you'll need some watercolors.<br> Here they are.<br> Some brushes, some oil...<br> and... No. This is an incomplete set...<br> but it'll do for now.<br> There's a palette, palette knife,<br> oil, turpentine.<br> Better have a couple of these.<br> Now, to improve your drawing,<br> you'll need to use casts.<br> Now let me see. Yes.<br> Take these home with you<br> and see that you work from them...<br> not less than<br> three hours each day, faithfully.<br> - Have you a place to work?<br> - I found a flat near the market...<br> - Has it got good light?<br> - I usually work out...<br> - How are you fixed for money?<br> - Theo's been sending me money.<br> The first few months<br> are always the hardest.<br> I don't suppose<br> a little extra will be unwelcome?<br> - Cousin Mauve...<br> - That will help you set yourself up.<br> - I can't tell you how...<br> - Not at all.<br> Now, come back next week,<br> let me see what you've done.<br> Please forgive me for barging in<br> when you're so tired.<br> Don't. That's all right.<br> - Just take these with you.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I can't tell you how grateful I am.<br> - That's all right.<br> Now take that.<br> How much longer do you need us?<br> I can't get supper ready<br> sitting in this chair, you know.<br> I'm sorry. You can get up now.<br> I'm going to the market.<br> Next time, will you keep<br> some money for food?<br> If we could eat drawings,<br> it might be different.<br> I saved some money.<br> You dropped it on the beach.<br> I didn't give it back to you.<br> My mother was right, getting myself<br> hooked up with a crazy painter.<br> Keep an eye on him.<br> Dear Brother, I think of you so often,<br> so very, very often these days.<br> If only you could be here<br> and see for yourself how it is with us. ;<br> that this is a real home, rooted in life...<br> with a woman and a cradle,<br> and a child's high chair.<br> The feeling I have for Christine is real, too.<br> I'm tired.<br> I'm going in to feed the baby.<br> Not yet. Christine, come back!<br> I'm fed up.<br> Month after month, it's the same thing.<br> - What's the matter now?<br> - I'm fed up with living on bread and coffee.<br> You take every penny you're given<br> and throw it away on paints and canvases.<br> - Don't start that again.<br> - Look at these.<br> How much do they cost?<br> You haven't even used up the old ones yet.<br> Shut up. Don't interfere with things<br> you don't know.<br> I won't. I have to pick up after you,<br> mend those rags you call clothes...<br> pose for you for hours,<br> on top of everything else.<br> - What do you think I am? Your slave?<br> - Stop nagging!<br> Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't better off<br> the way I was.<br> Don't you dare. Do you hear me?<br> If only we could have a piece of meat<br> once in a while, or an egg.<br> I'm sick of worrying every night<br> how we'll get money to eat the next day.<br> You call that a life?<br> Couldn't you write to your brother?<br> I can't ask him again.<br> He's helping all he can.<br> What about the man<br> who wanted to meet you?<br> - Tersteeg.<br> - Maybe he could sell some of your stuff.<br> I went to see him. Offered me<br> a hand-down like I was a beggar.<br> Didn't you take it?<br> He said I had no talent.<br> Even if I did, I started too late.<br> That leaves only your cousin Mauve.<br> Couldn't he help?<br> Or did you have a fight with him, too?<br> Did you?<br> Mauve can go to hell.<br> He helps me when he's in the mood.<br> The rest of the time,<br> he doesn't care whether I'm dead or alive.<br> "Oh, I'm sorry, my boy.<br> Go home. I can't see you now.<br> "Go home and work with those casts."<br> I'm sick of working<br> with those idiotic casts!<br> Don't look down your nose<br> at those casts of his.<br> He sells what he paints!<br> I don't want to hear about those casts<br> from you or from anybody else!<br> Cien?<br> Where've you been?<br> I asked you where you've been.<br> - At my mother's.<br> - For two days?<br> - You said you wouldn't go back.<br> - There was something to eat.<br> You promised<br> not to get into that life again.<br> And some jokes for a change.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - My father's ill. I have to go back.<br> - How long will you be gone?<br> - Depends on what happens.<br> - Vincent, I...<br> - Yes?<br> What is it?<br> Nothing.<br> There's some painting muslin<br> left in the cupboard.<br> Make some shirts for the boy.<br> I won't be there when you get back.<br> - Don't say that.<br> - I didn't want to tell you.<br> I've been feeling restless.<br> Besides, my mother's right, what she said.<br> You don't earn enough<br> for me and the baby.<br> - It's a bad life.<br> - This is no time for...<br> You'll forget about us once you get home.<br> It won't be hard.<br> - Where will you go? How will you live?<br> - It'll be the old life, I suppose.<br> Vincent, it's not your fault.<br> You've been good.<br> You're the only person<br> who's ever been good to me and the baby.<br> Just as if he was your own.<br> All aboard.<br> What is it<br> that came between Father and me?<br> Why couldn't I have shown him<br> a little more consideration?<br> Given him some pleasure<br> while he was alive?<br> It wouldn't have hurt me<br> to come to his church once in a while.<br> We always assume there's time...<br> and that we can give love<br> on our own terms.<br> Then one day we wake up and find<br> it's too late to give it on any terms.<br> Will you go back to your life in The Hague?<br> That's over.<br> It was wrong from the beginning.<br> Come to Paris, Vincent.<br> We could live together.<br> You're not the only one that's lonely.<br> Not yet, Theo. Some day, but not now.<br> You could meet other painters.<br> See what they're doing.<br> If I'm to be anything as a painter,<br> I've got to break through the iron wall...<br> between what I feel<br> and what I can express.<br> And my best chance of doing it is here...<br> where my roots are, the people I know...<br> the earth I know.<br> Dear Theo, thank you for the money,<br> the paints, and canvas.<br> With your help, I go forward.<br> I feel the force to work<br> growing daily within me.<br> Do your realize, Theo,<br> that what I'm doing is new?<br> In the paintings of the old masters...<br> did you ever see<br> a single man or woman at work?<br> Did they ever try to paint a laborer,<br> or a man digging?<br> They didn't.<br> And for good reason. ;<br> because work is so hard to draw.<br> Just look at the way he's dressed.<br> That old sheepskin.<br> Oh, my. I tell you, I'm sorry for the family.<br> To paint these people means to<br> be with them in the fields day after day...<br> and by their firesides at night.<br> Since the rains came,<br> I've become absorbed in the weavers.<br> They make such good subjects.<br> The old oak wood<br> darkened by sweating hands...<br> and the shadows of the looms<br> on the gray mud walls.<br> All these months<br> I've been trying to find a pattern...<br> trying not so much to draw hands,<br> as gestures...<br> not so much faces,<br> as the expressions of people.<br> Men and women<br> who know the meaning of toil.<br> I want to make clear that these people...<br> sitting around a meal of potatoes<br> in the evening...<br> have turned the soil<br> with the very hands they put in the dish.<br> That they have honestly earned their food.<br> I want to paint something<br> that smells of bacon smoke and steam.<br> Something that's the good, dark color<br> of our Dutch earth.<br> Willemien. Come in.<br> Here, sit down.<br> What's the matter?<br> - The neighbors been at you again?<br> - You know how they are.<br> Such a small place.<br> What is it this time?<br> It has to do with<br> the way you dress, partly, and...<br> I dress this way<br> because I work in the fields.<br> Because I have nothing else.<br> And the way you behave, too.<br> They don't understand it.<br> It makes trouble for us.<br> Since Father died, it hasn't been easy.<br> People have stopped coming to the house.<br> They avoid us.<br> It isn't very comfortable and...<br> Is your young man<br> one of those who's stopped coming?<br> Yes, he is.<br> But that doesn't matter so much.<br> - Yes, it does.<br> - It's the rest of the family.<br> Mother pretends she doesn't notice,<br> but I know it's upset her.<br> She'll never tell you, so I felt I must.<br> I'll get out. Take a few days to finish this,<br> and then I'll leave.<br> No, Vincent. I didn't mean that.<br> Of course you did, Willemien.<br> It's all right.<br> I've accomplished<br> what I stayed here to do...<br> and maybe it is time to move on.<br> I'm sick and tired of these cheap jokes.<br> Art is a serious business.<br> And in Paris, at least.<br> An artist with a new idea should be...<br> For once I agree with you, Durand-Ruel.<br> Impressionism is not a joke.<br> It's a cancer and it must be cut out.<br> Condone anarchism in the arts,<br> and you seal the doom of France.<br> What would you do?<br> Padlock the galleries...<br> - and ship the painters off to Devil's Island?<br> - No.<br> They don't paint.<br> They load pistols with tubes of paint...<br> and fire them at the canvas.<br> And then have the audacity<br> to sign their names...<br> Czanne, Signac, Pissarro,<br> Gauguin, Renoir, Monet.<br> You know these men.<br> You handled some of them.<br> Why didn't you tell me about it?<br> I wrote you in Antwerp.<br> Don't you read my letters?<br> But seeing them, the colors,<br> and what they've done with light.<br> - Is that painting?<br> - The critics and the public don't think so...<br> nor do my employers at Goupil's.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Now, if they're right,<br> then everything I've done is wrong.<br> Do they really know what they're doing?<br> You've got to meet and talk to them,<br> see what they think.<br> That's why I wanted you in Paris.<br> Where can I meet them?<br> I got so many questions.<br> - At 2:00 in the morning?<br> - Why not?<br> Listen, take that thing off and settle down.<br> You live here, you know.<br> We've got to make a Parisian out of you.<br> You'll have lots of time<br> to get your answers.<br> Tomorrow, we'll start with Pissarro.<br> It's the problem of translating light<br> into the language of paint.<br> Those leaves there,<br> if they were the only thing in sight...<br> they'd have one color, their own.<br> But the shade and reflection<br> of everything around...<br> the sky, the earth, the water,<br> give them more than their own color.<br> That's why, when you paint from nature,<br> don't fix your eye on any one spot.<br> Take in everything at once.<br> And above all, don't be timid.<br> Trust your first impression.<br> Everything you've been doing,<br> what we've all been doing. ; obsolete...<br> the whole lot of us<br> guessing with every brush stroke...<br> pouring rivers of paint<br> into haphazard combinations...<br> when actually, everything we're after<br> can be achieved mathematically.<br> What are you talking about? Seurat again?<br> Do you really think<br> a painting can be done by formula?<br> Can be? Is being done, right here in Paris...<br> through precise, scientific methods.<br> I don't mix my colors on canvas.<br> I mix them in the eye of the spectator.<br> Once you accept the phenomenon of<br> the duration of light in the human retina...<br> Excuse me. But this is a sunlit exterior.<br> Now, why do you paint it indoors<br> by gaslight?<br> - I mean, how can you judge your colors?<br> - Why not?<br> Come on, Seurat,<br> put him out of his misery.<br> - I've tried, but he's still in darkness.<br> - All right, Bernard. Come here.<br> Everything I do is worked out in advance...<br> with mathematical accuracy,<br> through precise scientific methods.<br> I know exactly<br> what colors I'm going to use...<br> before I pick up my brushes.<br> And my palette is methodically prepared<br> in the order of the spectrum.<br> As you see, blue, blue-violet,<br> violet, violet-red...<br> red, red-orange, orange-yellow...<br> Theo.<br> - Can't it wait till morning?<br> - No, please, I need your help.<br> Here.<br> - What is it this time?<br> - Look at this.<br> Yes, it's coming along.<br> It's got a very good sense of light.<br> - What's the matter? You look terrible.<br> - Will you be able to sell it?<br> I'll try.<br> It's hard to sell any of the new painters,<br> even the ones with some sort of name.<br> You know how Goupil's begrudges me...<br> the little space I can get for them<br> in the back room.<br> Then why don't you leave Goupil's?<br> Set up for yourself.<br> - Why waste time with idiots like that?<br> - Vincent, don't tell me how to run my life!<br> It's taken me a long time<br> to get where I am.<br> It may not be ideal, but, to me,<br> what I'm doing seems worthwhile.<br> And you don't make it any easier.<br> I haven't had any sleep for six months.<br> When people come to the house,<br> you insult them.<br> Don't I have a right to express my opinion?<br> This is my home.<br> You have no right to insult my guests!<br> Maybe I shouldn't have come to Paris<br> in the first place.<br> Vincent, all we've got<br> is what we can give each other.<br> You know how much joy it would give me<br> to sell your paintings.<br> I show them whenever I get a chance.<br> But perhaps you should take some<br> to some other dealer.<br> The more your work's seen, the better.<br> Go to Pre Tanguy.<br> I'll talk to him about you.<br> - Why should...<br> - See what he can do for you.<br> And show him some of your old work,<br> not just the new stuff.<br> Is that your way of saying<br> the new work's no good?<br> Vincent, I'm not going to argue with you<br> when you're in this mood.<br> - What mood? All I'm trying...<br> - Good night.<br> - Theo!<br> - Good night!<br> Vincent, it's all good, all of it.<br> The important thing is<br> that one day it could be sublime.<br> Between then and now,<br> there's one thing you could do for me.<br> A little thing, that's all I ask.<br> Let me get a night's sleep.<br> It's still the same. Nothing's changed<br> since I left here a year ago.<br> That's right.<br> You owed us 112 francs then<br> and you still do!<br> - Tanguy, remove your wife.<br> - Get in the back.<br> This man is absolutely correct, Tanguy.<br> You cannot handle painters<br> and woodpeckers, too.<br> The fact is, my dear friends,<br> that you are not painters.<br> You are tattoo artists.<br> You are chemists with little pots of paint.<br> You cover canvases with colored fleas.<br> You are so busy<br> imitating each other's tricks...<br> you've forgotten what painting is about.<br> You all make me sick.<br> What doesn't make you sick, Paul,<br> besides your own work?<br> Would you really like to know? That.<br> Look at that. The clarity, the calm.<br> The Japanese paint<br> as simply as we breathe.<br> - Maybe they pay for their paints.<br> - Who is he?<br> Paul Gauguin.<br> You have to go halfway around the world<br> to find something you like?<br> I don't have to leave this shop.<br> Look at that. And that.<br> - And that, and that.<br> - Czanne.<br> - Yes. Czanne.<br> - Yes. Czanne.<br> King of the unsaleables.<br> I suppose you call this painting...<br> Give me that painting!<br> Yes. It's direct, it's vigorous.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Vincent van Gogh.<br> He has a statement to make<br> and he makes it. Theo's brother?<br> Glad to know you. It's honest.<br> It owes nothing to anybody. Nothing.<br> Because it has nothing.<br> No tone, no values...<br> - No color relations.<br> - Sense of space.<br> The little men are at it again.<br> My friend, will you join me in a drink?<br> - What about the 112 francs?<br> - Lady, go back to your kitchen.<br> Get back.<br> You see, down there the sun invades you,<br> gets into your blood.<br> Not that Martinique was a paradise.<br> Between hunger and fever,<br> I was lucky to get out alive.<br> But if I could, I'd go back there tomorrow.<br> - How long you been in Paris?<br> - Over a year.<br> How can you stand it?<br> I can't work here. It strangles me.<br> - Where would you go?<br> - Brittany.<br> There's a place up there I can stay.<br> It's just a hole, but it's all I can afford.<br> Wouldn't you miss your friends in Paris?<br> Friends? A woman or two, maybe.<br> When you start as late as I did,<br> you find yourself measuring...<br> who and what you give your time to.<br> Friends, comforts, family.<br> If they interfere with your peace to work,<br> you cut them off...<br> and you spend the rest of your life<br> wondering if it was worthwhile.<br> If they're mad enough<br> to buy Impressionist paintings...<br> it only proves that they're savages.<br> I haven't seen the place looking so neat<br> since Vincent came to stay here.<br> What got into him, cleaning it up like this?<br> I do hope he's out.<br> Never would get any business done<br> if he's in.<br> What is it?<br> It's from Vincent.<br> "I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you,<br> and endlessly...<br> "grateful for all your kindness.<br> "I've hung a few paintings<br> to remind you of me."<br> - He's gone?<br> - He's on his way south to Arles, Provence.<br> "I've thought it over<br> these past few weeks...<br> "and decided the time has come<br> to make a change.<br> "I want to see nature under a clearer sky.<br> "Have to work by myself for a while."<br> No offense meant, but you'll be better off<br> without him around your neck.<br> I think I'm the best judge of that.<br> No, the worst.<br> You've been pushing his paintings.<br> And every time you do that,<br> we lose a customer.<br> As your employer,<br> I tell you for your own good...<br> your love for Vincent has blinded<br> your judgment. It's affected your work.<br> Please don't let's wrangle again<br> about that.<br> I'll fight for every good painter<br> who deserves to be recognized...<br> and Vincent is one of them.<br> He could be the best of them.<br> What? Well, you're his brother.<br> - You're emotional about him.<br> - That has nothing to do with it.<br> What is it when you brood about him?<br> When you agonize over his every failure?<br> When you support him<br> to the point of denying yourself?<br> You've saved every letter he wrote<br> as though it were Holy Scripture.<br> Come now, Theo. Don't you really think<br> you've done enough for him?<br> How much is enough...<br> for a man who's struggling with himself<br> the way Vincent is?<br> I know he's crude, quarrelsome,<br> and excitable...<br> but inside that tormented head of his<br> there's something wonderful.<br> In those letters, there's a gifted man,<br> a tender man...<br> and there's far more passionate beauty<br> and strength in his work...<br> than there is in half the stuff<br> you see in the museums today.<br> Wonder if there'll ever come<br> a happy time for him.<br> It seems impossible for him<br> to have a quiet life.<br> The change may do him good.<br> Maybe he'll find himself.<br> Or will he only find more loneliness?<br> This is it.<br> At that, it's worth<br> more than you're willing to pay.<br> - Anything else?<br> - No, thanks.<br> That'll be 8 francs for the week.<br> Get these pictures out of here!<br> - I told you a week ago.<br> - Don't touch that, you fool!<br> Can't you see it's still wet?<br> You're getting paint over everything.<br> That's why I raised your rent.<br> You had no right to do it<br> without telling me.<br> Whoever heard of a storage fee<br> for using a landing?<br> - Then get your stuff out of here!<br> - I will not!<br> Then pay me!<br> - Allow me.<br> - No, don't.<br> With your permission.<br> - Looks like you're moving.<br> - I'm getting out of that hellhole.<br> Here. I think you need some help.<br> That swine of a landlord.<br> Here you are.<br> I wondered how long you'd stand him.<br> Where do you think you're going<br> with all this stuff?<br> I don't know.<br> You're gonna have to find some place<br> before night.<br> I'd ask you to stay with me,<br> but it's a bit crowded with a wife...<br> - and four kids and one on the way...<br> - Thanks, anyway.<br> How'd you like a house?<br> - Too expensive.<br> - Perhaps not.<br> Come along, let me do the talking.<br> If there's one thing I hate, it's landlords.<br> Come along.<br> You wouldn't want a dump like that.<br> It should've been pulled down years ago.<br> Hey, wait a minute!<br> What are you trying to do to me...<br> talking like that about my property?<br> Is that what you're looking for, a house?<br> This is a fine house.<br> Look, my sister lived in it for 17 years<br> and then she died. God bless her.<br> That's what I mean.<br> Would you want me to show it to you?<br> How long would you want it for?<br> He won't want it at all,<br> not when he's seen it.<br> Now, look here, mind your own business<br> or I'll report you.<br> I'll let you have it at a good price, too.<br> How about 15 francs a month?<br> You stay out of this.<br> On top of that, I'll let you have<br> the use of an extra room.<br> A house, Theo. I found a house.<br> A place of my own<br> where I can work without a trouble.<br> And where there's plenty of room.<br> Roulin lent me a mattress to get started,<br> and I bought some chairs and a bed...<br> and a few other things<br> that were necessary.<br> With this and with what I spent<br> on paints and canvas...<br> my money for the month is almost gone.<br> But it was worth it.<br> Theo, you'd like this house.<br> It's yellow on the outside<br> and filled with sunshine.<br> Later, two could live in it.<br> One day, perhaps, Gauguin will come...<br> and then, who knows,<br> this might turn into a colony of painters.<br> I'm up at dawn and out on the road.<br> Now that summer's begun,<br> it's all very different here...<br> from what it was in the spring.<br> But I love it even more.<br> Everywhere is old gold, bronze,<br> and copper.<br> I wish you could see<br> these lovely days here, Theo.<br> But if not, you shall see pictures of them...<br> for these colors<br> give me an extraordinary exultation.<br> The whole earth is glowing<br> under the southern sun.<br> Lemon yellow, sulfur yellow,<br> greenish yellow...<br> all under a sky blanched with heat.<br> What a country it is.<br> It absorbs me so much<br> that I let myself go...<br> never thinking of a single rule.<br> I have no doubts, no limitations.<br> I'm working like a steam engine,<br> devouring paints, burning up canvases.<br> Whole days go by<br> without my speaking to anyone.<br> And every day my concentration<br> becomes more intense...<br> my hand more sure.<br> I have a power of color in me<br> that I never had before.<br> A sense of breadth and strength.<br> The summer has vanished<br> in a fever of work.<br> And now the mistral is blowing.<br> Always the wind, restless and unceasing.<br> Sweeping among the dead leaves<br> in a rage...<br> so that I'm forced to remain indoors.<br> Now and then,<br> when the storm inside me gets too loud...<br> I take a glass too much to distract me.<br> I must watch out for my nerves.<br> I'm getting haggard, I know.<br> If I go on this way...<br> some day or other there may be a crisis.<br> Yet I can't stop.<br> Sometimes I work on into the night.<br> And I'm hardly conscious<br> of myself anymore...<br> and the pictures come to me<br> as in a dream, with a terrible lucidity.<br> - What time did he get here?<br> - About 4:00 this morning.<br> As usual, two coffees, three absinthes.<br> - Did he eat anything?<br> - What do you think?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Roulin.<br> I brought something for you.<br> From your brother.<br> What I want to know is,<br> when do I get paid?<br> I don't mind carrying him for a day or two,<br> but this time it's over two weeks.<br> I must be as crazy as he is.<br> What do you think this is, a reading room?<br> - How much does he owe?<br> - 13 francs.<br> Here's 10 francs. Shut up.<br> Now. Here, let me give you a hand.<br> Come along.<br> Where were you painting last night?<br> We were looking for you everywhere,<br> all over the place. Couldn't find you.<br> - Theo's leaving.<br> - What?<br> No, it's good news. He's getting married.<br> That's wonderful.<br> Let's go right back and celebrate.<br> Do you know the girl?<br> She's a Dutch girl.<br> He's going to Holland this weekend<br> to meet her family.<br> Mother will be happy.<br> She's always wanted<br> one of us to get married.<br> When you write your brother,<br> wish him well from me and my family.<br> Yes, I will.<br> Thank you.<br> "But this doesn't mean<br> that I don't wish you both happiness...<br> "with all my heart.<br> "With your wife,<br> you won't be Lonely anymore.<br> "Your house won't be empty."<br> He must be so alone down there.<br> You two have always been so close.<br> Is there anything we can do, Theo,<br> to help him?<br> I wish I knew.<br> If only I could sell something of his.<br> Just one, that'd be a help.<br> Heaven knows I've tried.<br> He asks about Gauguin again, too.<br> He wants me to persuade him<br> to go down there.<br> - Gauguin?<br> - It might work.<br> When they were here last winter,<br> they seemed to get on.<br> Vincent was one of the few people<br> Paul didn't attack.<br> Perhaps if they were together...<br> If Vincent could have someone with him,<br> to whom he could pour out his heart.<br> Another painter.<br> - Do you think Gauguin would do it?<br> - He might.<br> I'd have to send him some money.<br> Enough to pay his debts in Brittany...<br> and get him down to Arles.<br> It could be the solution for both of them.<br> - Vincent!<br> - Paul?<br> - You're here. You're really here.<br> - Yes, I'm here.<br> You're a day early.<br> Theo told me you wouldn't come till...<br> Here, let me take these things.<br> Come on up, Paul.<br> Did you have trouble finding the place?<br> Your painting things are here,<br> and canvases.<br> They arrived the day before yesterday.<br> I fixed this room up for you.<br> - It's very nice.<br> - Thanks.<br> I painted them for you.<br> That's very friendly of you, Vincent.<br> That's very friendly.<br> Have you had anything to eat?<br> Come on downstairs.<br> I've got something on the stove.<br> I can't wait to see the things<br> you did in Brittany.<br> - I think you'll be interested.<br> - The way you wrote about them.<br> I may have hit something there<br> I never quite got before.<br> Sounds wonderful.<br> It was all I could do<br> to keep from opening them up...<br> and looking at them.<br> - Be ready in just a minute.<br> - Take your time.<br> I see you've been working.<br> That's not difficult<br> in this part of the world.<br> - I can't tell you, Paul.<br> - Yeah.<br> You'll see for yourself.<br> In the morning, you open the window,<br> see, there's the green of the gardens.<br> Wait till you see the yellow fields at noon<br> under the full sun.<br> And the light, you wouldn't believe it...<br> but all the time,<br> these yellows are really here.<br> Everywhere you look,<br> there's something to paint.<br> What an artist like you would do out here.<br> We'll go out this afternoon.<br> Wait a minute. I'm not one of<br> those painters that gets off the train...<br> and turns out a sunlight effect<br> before he's even unpacked his bags.<br> Paul, show me the Brittany paintings.<br> There's plenty of time for that.<br> - Come on, let's eat.<br> - All right.<br> A little heavy on the turpentine, isn't it?<br> What did you do,<br> boil some old paint tubes?<br> Smells like it.<br> Vincent, from now on<br> you better let me do the cooking.<br> All right.<br> Even my worst enemies<br> won't deny me that talent.<br> Do you really have to live like this?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Look at it. How can you stand it?<br> Look at the paint in those brushes.<br> How can you work this way? It's a mess.<br> If we're going to live together,<br> might as well start right.<br> - Let's get this place in order.<br> - Show me the paintings.<br> That can wait.<br> If there's one thing I can't stand,<br> it's confusion, mental or physical.<br> There. Now, this'll have to last us<br> till the first.<br> After that, everything Theo sends us<br> every month:<br> Your allowance,<br> his advance on my paintings...<br> goes into this box.<br> Anything we spend, we write down.<br> So much for food, so much for drink,<br> for tobacco and other relaxation.<br> That way there'll be no more starving<br> at the end of each month. Understood?<br> Understood.<br> I still can't believe you're here.<br> Before you came here,<br> I was a little frightened.<br> I'd been alone so long that...<br> I hope you, too, will find<br> what you want here, Paul.<br> A chance to create in peace.<br> This could be just the beginning.<br> We could get other painters here.<br> Make a colony of it. A studio of the south,<br> with you at its head.<br> - A Father Superior?<br> - As its guiding force.<br> I thought maybe we'd ask Bernard<br> and Lautrec, only he'd never leave Paris.<br> - And Signac.<br> - Haven't you heard?<br> I've dismissed Mr. Signac<br> from the legion of my devoted admirers.<br> He bores me.<br> What about Guillaumin and Seurat?<br> - You know what I think of Seurat.<br> - He's so ill.<br> - This place would do him good.<br> - It wouldn't do me good.<br> I don't want that kind of painting<br> around me.<br> Vincent, I've just spent a year<br> beating my brains out.<br> I've sacrificed everything:<br> Execution, effect...<br> all the things that come easiest to me,<br> for a style.<br> A style that'll convey the mood<br> of what I see...<br> the idea, without regard<br> for concrete reality.<br> What do you paint, then?<br> What's in my head.<br> Art's an abstraction, not a picture book.<br> A painting is a flat surface<br> covered with lines and colors...<br> arranged in certain order.<br> Yeah, but what about the arrangements<br> that exist in nature?<br> I choose to disregard nature.<br> What I'm after are harmonies...<br> harmonies of pure color, deliberately<br> composed and carefully calculated...<br> that move you as music moves you.<br> But then you deny<br> the greatest artists of all:<br> Rembrandt, Rubens, Delacroix, Millet...<br> Millet?<br> Millet! That calendar artist<br> with his dun-colored tones...<br> - and sentimental insipidities.<br> - How dare you say that?<br> Millet's one of the few artists<br> that ever really captured the human spirit.<br> Here. In the dignity of toil.<br> Millet uses paint<br> to express the word of God.<br> Then he should have been a preacher,<br> not a painter.<br> If there's one thing I despise,<br> it's emotionalism in painting.<br> - Vincent, painting is for painters.<br> - Like your friend Degas, I suppose...<br> who's done nothing but ballet dancers<br> and racehorses for 10 years.<br> You can learn from him.<br> You can learn control!<br> I don't want control!<br> I'm not afraid of emotion.<br> When I paint the sun,<br> I want the people to feel it revolving...<br> giving off light and heat.<br> When I paint a peasant...<br> I want to feel the sun pouring into him<br> like it does into the corn...<br> Is that what you do<br> when you overload your brush?<br> When you slap paint on like putty?<br> When you make your trees<br> writhe like snakes...<br> and your sun explode all over the canvas?<br> What I see when I look at your work<br> is that you paint too fast!<br> You look too fast!<br> Whatever you say, brigadier.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Maybe we need another drink.<br> I'm sorry, Paul.<br> Look, Paul, when I painted The Night Caf,<br> I tried to show evil.<br> The most violent passions of humanity.<br> I painted it blood red and dark yellow.<br> And a green billiard table in the middle.<br> Four lemon-yellow lamps...<br> with a glare of orange and green...<br> in an atmosphere of pale sulfur,<br> like a furnace.<br> I tried to show a place<br> where a man can ruin himself...<br> go mad...<br> commit a crime.<br> What's all of this talk<br> about Arlesian women?<br> - I haven't seen a good one yet.<br> - They must have heard you were coming...<br> - and they locked them up.<br> - Yeah.<br> Wait till you see.<br> There's something about them...<br> the way they carry themselves...<br> even the old ones,<br> a certain classic grace and dignity.<br> Dignity? I'm talking about women, man.<br> Women.<br> I like them fat, vicious, and not too smart.<br> Nothing spiritual, either.<br> To have to say "I love you"<br> would break my teeth.<br> I don't want to be loved.<br> You really mean that, Paul.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Show me the rest of the town.<br> Wait a minute. Here.<br> You pig! Kill him! Tear him apart!<br> You pig!<br> You didn't tell me the ballet was in town.<br> Wait a minute. You're tired.<br> There. That's more like it.<br> Now the town's coming to life.<br> Come on. Stop it.<br> Stop that. Get her out of here.<br> And you, I don't want any more trouble<br> in this place. See?<br> Come on, now get out.<br> I told the Captain<br> I wouldn't return until tomorrow.<br> - Pierre.<br> - Hello, Vincent, my friend.<br> - Hello, redhead. Where have you been?<br> - Hello, Rachel.<br> - I thought you must have gone away.<br> - I've been working.<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you like me anymore?<br> Hi. Buy me a drink?<br> My friend's come to town.<br> I've been getting the place ready for him.<br> - That tough?<br> - No, he's a painter, like me.<br> Thanks, sir.<br> - He's not like you, redhead.<br> - Hey, Vincent.<br> Look, a masterpiece,<br> direct from the salons. See?<br> Symbolism. Better send it to Theo<br> before the Louvre grabs it.<br> Paul, this is Rachel.<br> Vincent, why do I do it?<br> Here I pride myself<br> on my sense of logic and order...<br> and inside I'm a savage.<br> I have this attraction to violence.<br> Violence makes me sick.<br> I have too much inside me. I'm afraid of it.<br> That's why I let it out before it hurts me.<br> Last winter in Martinique...<br> I got into a fight with some sailors.<br> I was in the hospital for a month.<br> But it was worth it.<br> Even that piddling brawl out there...<br> made me feel better than I have in weeks.<br> And I know why.<br> Because suddenly<br> there's something in front of you...<br> something you can hit at.<br> He stands there, you smash his teeth in,<br> or he does it to you.<br> Either way, it's all right.<br> There's a decision.<br> - Two absinthes.<br> - Right away.<br> Three absinthes.<br> - Is everything all right?<br> - Yes, brigadier.<br> Dear Theo, I'm so happy<br> to have Gauguin here.<br> Not to be alone anymore.<br> It's of tremendous value to me<br> to see him work.<br> He's a very great artist, and a good friend.<br> Paul.<br> It doesn't seem to work. Doesn't work.<br> Paul, could you come over<br> and take a look?<br> Vincent, I'm trying to catch this light.<br> I remember what you said.<br> I soften my colors, I try to control them.<br> - Then I lose everything.<br> - Go back and try again.<br> That's what I mean.<br> You see how pale and thin that sky is?<br> You use the same brush strokes all over.<br> - It's got no texture, no energy. It's all flat.<br> - That's the way I see it!<br> Flat!<br> We argue, of course,<br> mainly about painting.<br> And our arguments are so electric...<br> that I come out of them often<br> with my brain tired...<br> like a run-down battery.<br> - What are you nervous about?<br> - We should be out there working.<br> - Look at that sunlight, Gauguin.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Listen to that wind.<br> - Wind doesn't show in a painting.<br> - What about it?<br> - I'm doing fine right here...<br> or I would be if you'd only like some place.<br> I'm tired of being cooped up here.<br> It wouldn't hurt you to work inside<br> for once.<br> - Use your imagination, invent.<br> - Why should I invent here...<br> when nature does it so much better<br> out there?<br> Go out there then, who's stopping you?<br> This is ridiculous. I can't work like this!<br> Tie down your easel.<br> No wonder they call you crazy<br> around here.<br> Come on, Vincent, let's get out of here.<br> Give it up! You can't paint in this gale.<br> - I've done it plenty of times.<br> - Yes, and I've seen the results.<br> I'm going back. I'm sick of all this.<br> The sun burns the eyes out of your head.<br> The stinking mistral blows you to pieces.<br> I'm sick of this whole miserable<br> countryside. And that house, too.<br> I don't know what I'm doing here<br> or why I ever came.<br> If that's the way you feel,<br> then why don't you leave?<br> Do you want to know why?<br> Because I haven't got the money.<br> Paul!<br> - Our money from Theo.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Can I pour you a drink, Paul?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Paul, all the way home, I kept thinking...<br> I wonder, Paul, if only we'd tried a little.<br> If we'd made some effort<br> to remain friends...<br> if it wouldn't have been better<br> for both of us.<br> I see you finished it.<br> Yes, because, Paul, when you look back...<br> so much of life is wasted in Loneliness.<br> There's not one of us<br> that doesn't need friends...<br> companionship, attachments.<br> I can do without attachments.<br> I've learned to avoid them.<br> How can you say that, Paul?<br> I mean, even you have your family.<br> Do you ever think of them?<br> Your children, you see them so seldom.<br> Mind your own business.<br> Paul, all I mean is that...<br> you, too, must have times<br> when you have a terrible...<br> Why don't you shut up?<br> If you have to slobber, don't do it over me.<br> You'll have no trouble finding subjects.<br> You mourn over a pair of old shoes.<br> You cry when you read Uncle Tom 's Cabin.<br> You bleed with Millet<br> over the nobility of toil.<br> For weeks I've been listening to that slop,<br> and I'm tired of it!<br> What do you know about toil?<br> When have you done<br> a stroke of manual labor in your life?<br> I have. I've dug ditches<br> in the stinking heat of the Tropics.<br> I've worked on the docks<br> in weather so cold...<br> my hands froze to the ropes.<br> And I can tell you there's nothing noble<br> or beautiful about it.<br> I did it so I could go on painting!<br> I didn't have a brother to support me!<br> Don't ever do that again.<br> Paul, where are you going?<br> I'm getting out<br> before one of us gets killed.<br> - Don't go.<br> - I'll be back for my things.<br> Please don't go. If you only knew<br> how Lonely I was before you came.<br> I know all about Loneliness.<br> Only, I don't whine about it.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Gauguin.<br> Your friend is in there...<br> dying.<br> - Why haven't you sent for the doctor?<br> - There's one on the way.<br> - What happened?<br> - His ear's been slashed off.<br> - What went on last night?<br> - I don't know. I wasn't here.<br> You live here.<br> Why did you leave?<br> - Did you two have a fight?<br> - Look, l...<br> Inspector, the doctor's here.<br> - Inspector.<br> - Right this way, Doctor.<br> - When did you find him?<br> - About an hour ago.<br> - Has he been conscious at all?<br> - Not at all.<br> It's a wonder he didn't bleed to death.<br> - Self-inflicted, Doctor?<br> - Looks that way.<br> What do you think, Doc?<br> Don't worry. You won't have<br> a corpse on your hands.<br> The thing is to get it cauterized<br> and cleaned.<br> - Gendarme, water and towels, please.<br> - Right away, sir.<br> You might as well know<br> that man's unbalanced.<br> Don't take my word for it.<br> Ask anyone around.<br> Last night, he got worse.<br> Just my being here<br> seemed to drive him out of his mind.<br> If I'm here when he comes to,<br> and he sees me, after all that's happened...<br> it could be fatal to him.<br> Will you need me for anything more?<br> No, I guess not.<br> I'll notify his brother.<br> What do you want here?<br> Nothing better to do than hang around<br> cluttering up the square?<br> Why don't you go home<br> and leave the man alone?<br> He's sick and he needs rest!<br> This is no sideshow!<br> You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!<br> Go on home! Go on!<br> Leave me alone!<br> - Come on, redhead!<br> - Leave me alone!<br> What happened to the other ear?<br> Vincent, I've just been with Dr. Rey.<br> You're doing very well.<br> Quite soon, now, you'll be able to travel.<br> - Johanna and I want you to...<br> - Theo.<br> I want to have myself committed.<br> I want to go to an asylum.<br> I have to, Theo.<br> One more of these attacks<br> could leave me helpless...<br> like a crab on its back.<br> Unable even to do away with myself.<br> You could come and live with us<br> in Paris and have a reasonable life.<br> I'll see that none of this<br> ever happens again.<br> How, Theo?<br> Will you and Johanna<br> take turns watching me...<br> to make sure<br> the symptoms aren't coming back?<br> When your baby's born...<br> I'm a danger to others,<br> I'm a danger to myself.<br> Believe me, I'll be better off in an asylum.<br> Vincent, don't. You mustn't think like that.<br> Find a place for me to go. Please.<br> Don't be sad. It won't be for long.<br> Just long enough for me<br> to find a little order in my life.<br> A little peace.<br> Yes, your brother has stated the case<br> most clearly...<br> including the fact that you have<br> voluntarily committed yourself here.<br> Now, you know, mental disease<br> is no different from any other ailment...<br> you might have contracted.<br> And these hallucinations you speak of,<br> once you recognize them...<br> as the normal accompaniment<br> of disturbances of this sort...<br> whether congenital or acquired...<br> once you accept your state for what it is,<br> half the terror has gone out of it.<br> - You do see that, don't you?<br> - Of course.<br> Beyond that, peace and rest.<br> Regular routine in agreeable surroundings.<br> You know, in this entire institution<br> at the moment...<br> we've no more than11 male patients.<br> The food is plain but healthy.<br> And above all, it is quiet. Yes.<br> Yes, it is quiet.<br> Now, here is our superintendent.<br> And this is Mr. Vincent van Gogh<br> from Holland.<br> Now, why don't you<br> take Mr. Van Gogh to his room...<br> and let him know<br> some of our rules and habits.<br> No, we'll store those away for you<br> for a little while...<br> until you see what you need. Yes.<br> Meanwhile, any time you need me...<br> ...mutilated his left ear.<br> In view of the above...<br> and in the light of my examination<br> of the patient...<br> it is my professional opinion...<br> that it will be necessary<br> for Mr. Van Gogh...<br> to undergo extended observation<br> and treatment...<br> in this institution.<br> Signed, Dr. Peyron,<br> dated Saint-Rmy, May 9, 1889.<br> Van Gogh, Vincent, June 14.<br> The patient's condition<br> appears satisfactory...<br> with continued improvement.<br> Continues to suffer, however,<br> from a condition of chronic inertia...<br> accompanied by symptoms<br> of extreme terror.<br> Would you like me to open the window?<br> The view is lovely from here.<br> General condition of patient: Fair.<br> Non-violent.<br> He has requested<br> that his painting equipment...<br> and other personal effects...<br> be placed in his room.<br> Request granted.<br> It's beautiful.<br> But the mower? Is he imaginary?<br> There's no one in that field.<br> That's just any man struggling in the heat<br> to finish his work.<br> It's the figure of death.<br> - It doesn't seem a sad death.<br> - It's not, Sister.<br> It happens in the bright daylight...<br> with the sun flooding everything<br> in a light of pure gold.<br> It would appear<br> that painting is beneficial...<br> perhaps even necessary...<br> for this patient's well-being.<br> Provided, of course...<br> that he is not permitted to indulge...<br> in those excesses of work and emotion...<br> that induced his former crisis.<br> This latest seizure was the most severe...<br> and prolonged...<br> that your brother has suffered to date.<br> As a result of constant attention...<br> and observation...<br> he is today approaching physical recovery.<br> He now expresses the desire<br> to leave this institution...<br> with the intention of taking up residence<br> in the north.<br> And since you support him...<br> in this request...<br> he will be discharged...<br> as soon as he is considered fit to travel.<br> - Vincent.<br> - Hello, Johanna.<br> - It's good to see you.<br> - It's about time.<br> You're just as pretty as I thought you'd be.<br> Don't you think he looks well, Theo?<br> - He looks better than I do.<br> - Where's that baby?<br> - When do I get to see him?<br> - He's asleep...<br> but since he's your namesake,<br> you can go in.<br> You try and keep me out.<br> I brought him a little present.<br> I hope he likes it.<br> - There's your nephew.<br> - He's a real van Gogh.<br> When Willemien was here, she said<br> he looked more like Father than anyone.<br> No, there's some of Johanna in him.<br> Look at those hands...<br> - and see how well-behaved he is.<br> - Just wait till he gets hungry.<br> Vincent! Are you all right?<br> Come sit down.<br> You'll be all right.<br> I'm fine. I was dizzy for a moment.<br> - You're tired.<br> - I'll get you some coffee.<br> Thanks, Johanna.<br> I'm all right, really. It was a long trip.<br> I left the best news until you got here.<br> - Your painting of The Red Vineyard.<br> - What about it?<br> It sold for 400 francs.<br> Who bought it?<br> A painter. Anna Bock.<br> She lives in Brussels.<br> That's fine. I'm glad...<br> Theo, I had no idea<br> I'd sent you so much stuff.<br> It certainly adds up.<br> I've hardly given you room<br> to move around.<br> We still have some space<br> to squeeze a few people in here.<br> As a matter of fact, I was thinking of<br> asking some of your friends over tonight.<br> - Where's Paul?<br> - He's in Brittany.<br> But Lautrec, Pissarro, Bernard,<br> they want to see you.<br> We ought to celebrate your first sale.<br> Or would you rather leave it till later?<br> No, make it tonight.<br> I think the sooner I get settled in Auvers,<br> the better.<br> It isn't as if I were going a long ways off.<br> Why, you can all come out and see me<br> on Sunday.<br> Is everything set there with Dr. Gachet?<br> - Is he expecting me?<br> - Pissarro made all the arrangements.<br> They were here together last week.<br> - Did they see my new things?<br> - Gachet got so excited.<br> He wouldn't leave<br> until I'd lent him a couple.<br> - Did you explain to him about me?<br> - Yes, Vincent, I did.<br> He seems very confident.<br> Thanks, Johanna. Good Dutch cookies.<br> I don't understand you, Theo. With such<br> fine Dutch cooking in the house...<br> you know it's about time you<br> put some flesh on those bones of yours.<br> I'm really very hopeful, Vincent.<br> Dr. Gachet's got a very good name...<br> and he says that...<br> Dr. Gachet, you see,<br> that's what I have to know.<br> Will there be a warning?<br> Will I have time to...<br> About those seizures of yours,<br> do you want my opinion?<br> Forget them, completely.<br> Tell yourself you're finished with them...<br> and work boldly and joyously.<br> Vincent, you don't know<br> how lucky you are.<br> To have done one painting<br> like that cypress in there...<br> or those sunflowers<br> that your brother showed me...<br> I'd give 10 years of my life.<br> - Don't you like your wine?<br> - I don't drink much these days.<br> Yes, for a painter,<br> work is the only medicine there is.<br> And this is the place for it.<br> Come in.<br> Czanne's. Do you recognize it?<br> He painted it right in this room...<br> and that is this house.<br> He painted that from across the street.<br> Yes, as a matter of fact,<br> there's hardly a canvas here...<br> that wasn't done right in this house<br> or within 100 yards of it.<br> Have you seen this Daumier?<br> It's a wonder.<br> Strong, isn't it?<br> Yes, he came here many times, Daumier.<br> He was a strange one.<br> So, you see, when I tell you...<br> that I understand<br> the artistic temperament...<br> When Manet was dying,<br> they called me in for consultation.<br> They wanted to amputate.<br> I said no. No, not for a man like that.<br> But they wouldn't listen.<br> - Lunch is served, Doctor.<br> - Good, Therese.<br> You can put it on the table now.<br> We'll be right out.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Guillaumin.<br> - It's a beauty, isn't it?<br> If you like, I'll take you out<br> and show you where he painted it.<br> I wanted him to join us at Arles.<br> - Look, it's warped.<br> - Is it?<br> You better have it framed.<br> I was meaning to take it in. I will.<br> I'll do it tomorrow.<br> Dear Theo, I've seen Dr. Gachet.<br> He's a pleasant man.<br> He has some good paintings in his house.<br> He wants me to do his portrait.<br> But as for his helping me...<br> I'm afraid we mustn't hope for too much.<br> When the blind lead the blind...<br> don't they both fall in the ditch?<br> Mr. Vincent, at what time would you like<br> to have your breakfast in the morning?<br> Don't worry about that.<br> I'll be out early, before you get up.<br> Just leave some bread<br> and some cold coffee. That'll be fine.<br> Gachet is right about one thing.<br> This place is beautiful.<br> It tempts me to paint<br> and the work goes well.<br> You'd think being a doctor,<br> seeing so much of pain and suffering...<br> that I've got problems enough<br> for one man.<br> But, no.<br> I go around founding societies<br> and joining groups...<br> and then this passion of mine for art.<br> Besides portraits,<br> I've been doing some landscapes.<br> I have a feeling of being<br> surer of my brush than ever before.<br> So I work in haste from day to day...<br> as a miner does<br> who knows he's facing disaster.<br> Vive Monsieur le maire!<br> It's impossible.<br> I can make a joke<br> of this whole sorry business...<br> if it wasn't for the trouble I've caused you.<br> If you'd at least have gotten back<br> the cost of paint and the canvas.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> - Is the baby really better?<br> - Yes.<br> We were worried about nothing.<br> He was just teething.<br> That was all of his trouble.<br> I only hope he has a quieter soul<br> than mine...<br> 'cause mine's sinking.<br> Sinking.<br> Theo?<br> I'd like to go home.<br> My own brother.<br> My poor, poor brother.<br> - It doesn't seem a sad death.<br> - It's not, Sister.<br> It happens in the bright daylight...<br> with the sun flooding everything<br> in a light of pure gold.<br> English<br>
