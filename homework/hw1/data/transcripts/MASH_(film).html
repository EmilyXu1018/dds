I've got glasses. Get him off me!<br> What's going on, Frank? That lesson one?<br> Frank Burns has gone nuts!<br> [Chattering]<br> I'm wearing glasses, for God's sake.<br> Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye.

Let me try it on you.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, Dago Redo! Hi. Just in time for cocktails. Come on in.<br> Uh, no, no. Thank you. I can't, really. Hawkeye?<br> - Haw-Hawkeye? Hawkeye, could I speak to you?<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> - No, uh, out-outside. Outside.<br> - What?<br> I have to talk to you outside.<br> [Dog Barks]<br> - All right.<br> - Hiya, pup-pup.<br> - Uh, sorry to drag you away from the gang in there, but...<br> - What?<br> This- This'll only take a moment. Um,<br> - there's a problem with Walt Waldowski.<br> - Painless?<br> - Painless.<br> - You got a toothache? He's a good dentist.<br> No, no, no. It's not my problem. It's his problem. Um...<br> - What do you mean? What is it?<br> - Well, what is it? That's, um...<br> It's difficult to talk about, you see, because, um,<br> I learned about his problem in confession.<br> - Oh, and you can't...<br> - I can't divulge.<br> Can you give me a hint? [Chuckles]<br> - Just an idea.<br> - No. Um...<br> But I can... I can tell you how, uh... how serious it is.<br> Um, he and the boys were playing poker, and one of the boys turned to him...<br> and asked him for a ruling on one of the hands.<br> And Walt said, uh... He said, "What does it matter?<br> "It's only a game."<br> - Painless said, "What does it matter? It's only a game"?<br> - "Only a game."<br> - Poker only a game?<br> - Yeah.<br> - [Whistles]<br> - Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's what I thought.<br> I guess I better go see a man about a tooth.<br> - Thank you.<br> - [Helicopter Whirring]<br> I didn't know what to... do.<br> - Pup-pup.<br> - You see, there are some...<br> - [Hawkeye Whistles]<br> - Uh, there are some things that absolution just, uh...<br> Well...<br> [Chattering]<br> [Ugly John] Hey, Hawkeye, there's an empty chair here looking for a player.<br> Oh, baby, I've got a toothache like you can't believe.<br> [Murrhardt] Why do you bring that dog in here? Last time you did, I lost $30.<br> Listen, why do you have to sit right behind me? It makes me very nervous.<br> It brings me a lot of luck. Sit there, Boone.<br> [Man] Come on. Let's play, man. Deuce. Ace.<br> - Can I take some of your scotch?<br> - Sure.<br> - You want some?<br> - No.<br> - How you feeling?<br> - No, no. Don't touch me.<br> Look. If, uh...<br> if a man isn't a man anymore,<br> what's he got left that, uh... that he should be living for?<br> Okay. Tell me about it. What's the story?<br> Well, you know that, uh, little nurse that was through here last night with the 325th?<br> - The little one with the big... boobs.<br> - Yeah, the... Yeah, I know. Yeah.<br> Well, anyway, I, uh...<br> I wasn't gonna fool around out here...<br> because, you know, I got these, uh...<br> I've got these three girls that I'm engaged to back home.<br> And you wanted to be faithful to them. Baby, you are 7,000 miles from home...<br> Anyway, I took her out last night, and I...<br> - I failed.<br> - You mean she wouldn't put out? But you...<br> No, she wanted to in the worst way, but it was me. I just couldn't. Uh...<br> - Oh, you couldn't? It wouldn't get?<br> - Yeah, nothing happened.<br> - Not at all. No.<br> - [Chuckles] Baby, that happens to everybody.<br> It's happened to me maybe four or five times...<br> Yeah, well, it's never happened to me before.<br> Come on. You're the best-equipped dentist in the army.<br> You're the dental Don Juan of Detroit.<br> That's just a cover-up.<br> - Wh-what's a cover-up?<br> - Don Juanism. I've been reading about it all day.<br> - It's a cover-up.<br> - It's a cover-up for what?<br> Well,<br> I'm a fairy.<br> A victim of latent homosexuality.<br> I've turned into a fairy.<br> Uh... [Stammers]<br> Have you... Have you done anything? You know.<br> - No, but it's only a matter of time.<br> - Yeah.<br> Boy, I just can't face it.<br> Look, Hawkeye. Suppose that, uh, you found out that you were one, huh?<br> - One?<br> - Yeah. Well, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife.<br> No, I can see that that would be a problem.<br> Yeah, well, I got the same problem, only multiplied.<br> [Trapper] Well, you know, Man o' War,<br> after they retired him from racing,<br> they put him out to, uh... to stud.<br> And, uh, he had an average...<br> of about 120, 130...<br> foals every year.<br> And he lived to be 36.<br> And then when he died, they did an autopsy,<br> and they found out that he was a raving queen.<br> [Man Laughing]<br> No. That's- That's a little-known fact, but it's the truth.<br> Then Painless has got a couple of good years left in him, doesn't he?<br> Maybe more. He hasn't even started raving yet.<br> Painless is a dentist, and a dentist shouldn't read. That's his whole problem.<br> His problem is that he believes it. I mean, he really is convinced.<br> This- This... It's an obsession and is a viable force.<br> - Here he comes, the jawbreaker.<br> - Oh.<br> [Trapper] Don't worry. He's not gonna break anything of yours.<br> [Duke] Just act, uh, natural.<br> [Snickers]<br> [Man Chuckles]<br> - Hi, Painless.<br> - Hi.<br> How's she going?<br> Something in a marshmallow?<br> [Painless] No, it's- it's okay, fellas. I know you've been talking about me, and...<br> Well, I came over to tell you that I've decided that I'm...<br> - going to commit suicide.<br> - [Snickers]<br> Oh.<br> Well, if you're really gonna go ahead and do it,<br> uh, you think you could... you could leave me your record player?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> - Thank you.<br> Gonna miss you, Painless. How do you plan to do it? Uh, .45 between the eyes?<br> - Oh, that's awful sloppy.<br> - [Murrhardt] It's reliable though.<br> Well, the... That's another thing I wanted to ask you.<br> I'm, uh, sort of new at this game and, uh...<br> Do you have any particular method that you'd recommend?<br> I don't know. I think my colleagues and I could come up with something,<br> uh, to relinquish the vital forces of their...<br> - Black capsule.<br> - Black capsule.<br> - Oh, but of course.<br> - [Murrhardt] Yeah, that's neat.<br> What's a black capsule? Do you have any of them? Does it work?<br> - It worked for Hitler and Eva Braun.<br> - It's simple, and it's effective.<br> Uh, Hawkeye, I really must...<br> I-I should, uh, check with the military vicar's office.<br> You see, I cannot give absolution to a man who is about to commit suicide.<br> - It's a mortal sin.<br> - Look, Dago, he is not committing suicide.<br> He is only intending to commit suicide, so you're not dealing with an act.<br> You're dealing with an intention.<br> And if it works- If what we're doing works, then he will not commit suicide.<br> So, therefore, you are preventing a mortal sin, okay?<br> [Men Chattering] Well, I, uh... I should check.<br> - Well, you check on it.<br> - Well, there's...<br> - [Chattering]<br> - [Violin Playing "Taps"]<br> [Chattering Continues]<br> [Tapping Glass] [Duke] All right, where you at?<br> Here you go.<br> Now then, y'all come here...<br> to say your final farewell to ol' Walt here.<br> - [Trapper] Farewell, Walt.<br> - Dear ol' Walt.<br> You know, I got an idea that maybe it's not such a final farewell after all.<br> I think maybe ol' Walt's going on into the unknown...<br> - Say it again.<br> - To do a little recon work for us all, huh?<br> I just... I just wanna say one thing.<br> Uh, nobody ordered Walt to go on this mission.<br> He volunteered for certain death.<br> - That's true.<br> - That's what we award our highest medals for.<br> - That's beautiful.<br> - That's what being a soldier is all about.<br> - [Trapper] Oh, yeah.<br> - Hear, hear!<br> Gentlemen, I think there's only one person...<br> who has anything to add to that, and that's Dago Red.<br> Padre. Let's hear it for the padre.<br> [Clears Throat]<br> Walt, here's- here's your black capsule.<br> Oh.<br> Look, this thing works pretty fast, doesn't it?<br> I think I better go lie down over there.<br> - Uh, Walt, that'll help you.<br> - [Guitar]<br> Mmm. Thanks.<br> Through early morning fog I see<br> Visions of the things to be<br> The pains that are withheld for me<br> I realize<br> And I can see<br> That suicide is painless<br> It brings on many changes<br> And I can take or leave it<br> If I please<br> The game of life is hard to play<br> I'm going to lose it anyway<br> The losing card I'll someday lay<br> So this is all I have to say<br> - That suicide is painless<br> - Wherever you're going, Painless, good luck.<br> - It brings on<br> - [Indistinct]<br> Many changes<br> And I can take<br> - Or leave it if I<br> - I'll always remember you just like this.<br> Please<br> The only way to win is cheat<br> And lay it down before I'm beat<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - And to another<br> Give my seat<br> - [Whistles, Clicks Tongue]<br> - For that's the only<br> - Painless feat<br> - Painless.<br> And suicide is painless<br> - It brings on many<br> - It was a really nice evening. Thanks for asking me.<br> Changes<br> And I can take<br> - Or leave it if I please<br> - The thing is...<br> throwing your whole education away.<br> - And you<br> - Good-bye, Jawbreaker.<br> Can do<br> The same thing<br> If you<br> Please<br> Hi, baby.<br> - Hi.<br> - I'm glad you could come.<br> - Sorry it was so late.<br> - That's okay.<br> I really couldn't sleep anyway. I was so nervous.<br> You leaving tomorrow?<br> [Sighs] Mmm, yeah, I'll be on my way in less than 12 hours.<br> I suppose who it's going to be really roughest on, though, is your husband.<br> Why are you all of a sudden so concerned with him?<br> I mean, a man would be more considerate to his wife.<br> He wouldn't go home a nervous wreck.<br> You're just gonna have to stop using logic.<br> - It could be a purely impersonal thing.<br> - You're just proving...<br> why I shouldn't go to bed with you.<br> I didn't mean me.<br> [Hawkeye] You have the rare privilege that happens on certain occasions...<br> to chief executives of states or nations.<br> You have the privilege of restoring a human being's life...<br> by a tender act of mercy.<br> What is this?<br> Hawkeye, is he dead?<br> No, no, he's not dead. Not yet.<br> Painless has a grave psychological problem,<br> and you are the only person who can help him.<br> Oh, no, Hawkeye. Oh, no. Come on.<br> [Hawkeye] No, Maria, no. You've gotta look on this as a nurse.<br> Painless needs it for therapeutic value.<br> It will help him, and it certainly wouldn't do you any harm either...<br> to think about it for a bit.<br> If you think that your virtue is more important than Painless's life, that's fine.<br> That's entirely up to you. I just want you to stay here...<br> and be with him for a minute.<br> Just look at him. Just... stay close to the...<br> - Oh, Hawkeye.<br> - The whole man...<br> and look at him.<br> [Curtains Rustle] Hawkeye.<br> Oh, this is ridiculous.<br> [Chorus Vocalizing]<br> [Swells]<br> You forgot your hat.<br> You wouldn't want to leave without a souvenir.<br> Have a good trip.<br> Lieutenant Schneider, you forgot to pick up your traveling orders.<br> Wait a second. You're supposed to pick- These are your traveling orders.<br> - Morning, Painless.<br> - Oh, hi, Hawkeye.<br> How's she going?<br> - Slept like a doll last night.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Well, can't waste time. Big day.<br> Got two jaws to rebuild. Come on, Seidman.<br> Have a good day.<br> [Whistles]<br> [Man On P.A.] Attention. Attention.<br> Religious services for Yom Kippur will be held this-<br> - will not- will not be held this Friday, due to mitigating circumstances.<br> - [Hawkeye Whistles]<br> For those who wish to observe said holiday, Sunday has been reserved.<br> That is all.<br> - [Hawkeye] Trapper, this one's for you, babe.<br> - [Trapper] Knife.<br> [Man] Okay.<br> - [Houlihan] That man is a prisoner of war, Doctor.<br> - So are you, sweetheart,<br> but you don't know it.<br> - [Hawkeye] It's in pretty deep.<br> - [Duke] Uh, I think that was my finger.<br> Yeah, I'm gonna need your help, Hawkeye. It's hit more than a lung.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Knocko, gauze rolls.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Hey, Radar?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Radar, has that A-negative come in from Seoul yet? I need some right away.<br> We keep ordering it, but it never arrives.<br> - How'd the kid take the induction, Ugly?<br> - Good.<br> - He's ready.<br> - [Man] Let's have some irrigation, please.<br> - That's pretty good.<br> - Yeah.<br> [Duke] All right, give me some gel foam.<br> Not now, honey. Go back to sleep.<br> [Trapper] Scissors.<br> - [Hawkeye] Sponge.<br> - [Houlihan] More sponges.<br> [Man] Let's have the suction up here, please. Thank you.<br> Rib spreader.<br> Clamp.<br> Let's give him a sexy scar, huh? Fantastic.<br> [Ugly John] There's a lot of blood. Sponge.<br> [Duke] Go ahead. Scissors. Watch it.<br> - [Duke] Give me something to stuff it in with.<br> - Clamp.<br> - [Man] Pickups for me.<br> - How's he tolerating this, Ugly John?<br> Good. He's young. Things get slippery in there, man.<br> Ouch! You're a backhanded guy.<br> Let me have the forceps and a sponge stick.<br> Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass, but you're a damn good nurse.<br> Thanks, Trapper.<br> Put enough blood in him, will you, John?<br> There's a clot in the cava above the atrium. That must be the point of entry.<br> Clamp.<br> I... I feel a fragment right underneath the clot. You control the cava.<br> [Murrhardt] We gotta stop that spurting. Clamp.<br> - [Duke] Do what?<br> - [Murrhardt] Stop the spurting.<br> [Duke] That's a very good technical term, Doctor. This is yours.<br> Oh, Christ, it's not in the cava. It's in the pulmonary artery on the left side.<br> Then we close him up and sit on him for a couple days until we get the blood.<br> - We can't sit on him. What if we get jammed?<br> - We don't have the blood.<br> [Both Talking At Once] If you cut again, you'll lose him.<br> Look, Hawkeye, the artery can erode.<br> Now's the time to take our shot. We gotta shoot crap.<br> A-negative. It's been cross-matched.<br> - You said you didn't have any blood.<br> - I found a donor.<br> [Ugly John] You know, up close, all crumpled up like that,<br> they don't look like much, you know.<br> [Bandini] Hey, was he loaded or empty when he crashed?<br> [Murrhardt] No, he was loaded. But it didn't matter much.<br> See, the, uh... the two guys he was carrying were dead already.<br> What about the pilot? What happened to him?<br> The pilot's fine. Took off a kneecap.<br> He lost function in his right hand, but he's great.<br> I...I didn't hear. What color was her hair?<br> Black, shiny. Shiny black hair. [Barking]<br> Black. You like black.<br> I-I'm kind of partial to blonde myself.<br> I knew it. I knew you had a... had an attraction...<br> - for Hot Lips Houlihan.<br> - Hear, hear!<br> Go to hell, Captain Pierce. You know I damn near puke every time I look at her.<br> Besides, she's- I'll bet she's not a real blonde.<br> How dare you say that about an officer of the United States Army, sir!<br> I'll not only say it, but I'll back it with 20 bucks. How's that?<br> You have yourself a bet, sir. You're my witness.<br> I'll be a witness, but who's gonna be the poor schmuck who finds out?<br> Well, uh, I-I could, if no one else want... I...<br> No, no, we...<br> We gotta all see it together somehow.<br> [Ice Rattling]<br> [Humming]<br> You know, it's five minutes after the time the nurses usually take their shower.<br> - Where are they?<br> - They will be here.<br> Finest kind, Ho-Jon.<br> - What's happening?<br> - Radar.<br> - Did you bring us the papers?<br> - What?<br> - You don't know about the papers?<br> - What papers?<br> - The colonel left some papers. They're very important.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> I tried to tell you.<br> Uh, uh, here you go. Here you go. They're coming.<br> [Chattering]<br> - Evelyn, could you give me a hand?<br> - Sure.<br> Hey, uh, Frankie, could you take a look at my corns, please?<br> [Hawkeye] Knocko, the pictures of my kids have come.<br> Pictures of my kids have come. Hot Lips, would you like to see the pictures of my kids?<br> I'm not the slightest bit interested.<br> - Hey, Scorch?<br> - Yeah?<br> All right.<br> [Dog Barking]<br> [Water Running]<br> [Houlihan Singing, Indistinct]<br> - Oh!<br> - [Singing, Indistinct]<br> Fight! Fight! Fight! [Singing, Indistinct]<br> [Houlihan Laughing]<br> - [Guitar]<br> - [Drumroll On Barrel]<br> [Dog Barking]<br> [Screaming]<br> - Bravo!<br> - [All Hollering, Whistling]<br> You finks! You finks!<br> Bravo! Bravo!<br> What a performance! Bravo! Author! [Indistinct Yelling]<br> Bravo! What a performance!<br> Bravo! Author! Author!<br> Twenty bucks, huh? You win the bet.<br> You bastards!<br> Keep my stuff!<br> [Breathing Heavily]<br> - Major, what went on over there?<br> - Where's Colonel Blake?<br> Wait a second. You can't go and see Colonel Blake.<br> You shut up, you twerp!<br> [Grunts]<br> This isn't a hospital! It's an insane asylum!<br> And it's your fault because you don't do anything to discourage them!<br> - What do you want me to do?<br> - Put them under arrest.<br> See what a court-martial thinks of their drunken hooliganism!<br> First they called me Hot Lips, and you let them get away with it!<br> And then you let them get away with everything!<br> If-If you don't...<br> turn them over to the M.P.'s this minute,<br> I-I'm going to resign my... my commission!<br> Goddamn it, Hot Lips, resign your goddamn commission.<br> [Whimpering]<br> My commission!<br> My commission!<br> My commission!<br> Little more wine, my dear?<br> Yes, please.<br> [Speaking Korean] Is that right? Sure?<br> [Speaking Korean] [Chattering]<br> [Scorch] You have to get your mother her present first.<br> - You know what I wanna get her? They have these? [Speaking Korean]<br> - What?<br> [Boone Continues, Indistinct]<br> - Come on. You all right?<br> - No.<br> Let him get what he wants. We'll go to the movie. Keep it straight, eh?<br> [Scorch] No. First of all, the present. Then dinner, then the movie.<br> - You mean all three of us?<br> - Who is this?<br> - Where I go, Warren goes.<br> - You don't want me to go with you?<br> Boone.<br> [Murrhardt] It's not that. I... [Whispering]<br> [Scorch] Oh, yes, I do!<br> He's Syngman Rhee's son, and he goes right in.<br> - [Chattering In Korean]<br> - [Scorch] Come on, Bandini!<br> [Bandini] Wilma? [Arguing Continues]<br> [Hawkeye Whistling, Shouting In Korean]<br> [Continues In Korean]<br> [Woman] Hey, soldier!<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah, you.<br> - Where you from?<br> - A MASH outfit on the front line.<br> - No, I mean your hometown.<br> - Uh, on the East Coast.<br> Have you been wounded yet?<br> Uh, yeah, a little. A slight, uh...<br> Would you like to say hello to your mother?<br> Uh, my mother's dead, actually. She's deceased.<br> Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I'd like to say hello to my father if I could.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine, fine.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> [Speaks Korean]<br> [Chattering]<br> [No Audible Dialogue]<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Hi.<br> I am making an examination of this young man,<br> uh, to find out if he would be a soldier in our army.<br> Oh, yeah, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How's she going, boy?<br> His heartbeat is much too fast,<br> and his, uh, blood pressure is dangerously high.<br> Oh, yeah? Ooh.<br> I guess you probably think he's unfit for the army, eh?<br> Yes, at first. But when I saw on his paper...<br> he worked in an American hospital where there are many drugs,<br> and he could have taken some by mistake.<br> - What would he do a thing like that for?<br> - Who knows?<br> To find the truth, I will keep him here with me for a couple days.<br> By tomorrow, his fast heart and high blood pressure may be gone.<br> - Look...<br> - So-So I suggest you say good-bye to him now.<br> - Doctor, I will level...<br> - Nice try. It was a nice try.<br> - Come on, Ho-Jon.<br> - Babe, hey?<br> Oh, man!<br> [Man On P.A.] The following program is brought to you...<br> through Radio Tokyo by courtesy of the Veterans of Foreign Wars,<br> post number 63 of Sedalia, Missouri.<br> A federal court ruled that E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company,<br> Remington Arms Company, Incorporated...<br> and the Imperial Chemical Industries Limited of Great Britain...<br> have conspired to divide munitions and chemical markets... [Fades]<br> Fore!<br> [Hawkeye Yells, Indistinct]<br> [Dogs Barking]<br> - [Woman] Hey!<br> - [Hawkeye] Idiot!<br> Idiot! He knocked me down the hill. He broke my umbrella.<br> Wish they wouldn't land these things here when we're playing golf.<br> - That's him on the right.<br> - Fore!<br> Whoa! Wait! Wait! That's Captain Mc...<br> The lieutenant's come all the way from Seoul, sir, just to see you.<br> - You're Captain McIntyre?<br> - Yes, I'm Captain McIn...<br> Lieutenant, you look terrible. Look at...<br> Captain, look at his eyes. Let me see your tongue.<br> Oh, no, no. Here, take your shirt off and tell me where it hurts.<br> I haven't seen a case like this since I was in school. Oh, my goodness.<br> Listen, Vollmer, tell them to prepare the major surgery.<br> This is one case in five. I think I can save you, Lieutenant.<br> You're to proceed to Kokura, Japan immediately.<br> Kokura, Japan? What's this all about?<br> Yeah, his dad's a congressman. Grenade went off in practice. There's a piece in his heart.<br> - What?<br> - GI's dad's a congressman.<br> Grenade went off in practice. There's a piece in his heart.<br> - Is that the X-rays?<br> - Yeah.<br> Apparently some big heart surgeon in Boston told the congressman...<br> the only man to take care of his son is Captain John McIntyre.<br> Of course, I suppose there could be two Captain John McIntyres.<br> No, no, I'm the only John McIntyre.<br> Look, Hammond says I can take along someone to assist me if I need him.<br> - You wanna come?<br> - Yeah.<br> Lieutenant, I think I can save you.<br> Look, take one of these every half hour.<br> Now get into your helicopter and button up your shirt, for crying out loud.<br> You're in a military army!<br> - That piece isn't even close to his heart.<br> - I know. I know.<br> It's nothing, but how many times do you get to go to Japan with your golf clubs?<br> Come on, Shirley. [Chuckling]<br> [Hawkeye And Trapper Imitating Japanese]<br> Goddamn army.<br> [Imitating Japanese]<br> [Japanese Continues]<br> - Goddamn army.<br> - [Japanese Continues]<br> [Engine Sputters]<br> Goddamn army jeep!<br> Excuse me, soldier. I wonder if you could tell me where the congressman's son is.<br> - He's in ward six.<br> - Darling, would you register for us?<br> Just a moment. You can't go in there. Who are you?<br> Who am I? I am the pro from Dover, and this is my favorite caddy.<br> You can't go in till I call Captain Peterson.<br> Wait a second. If this soldier wants to enforce her own orders,<br> - I'm gonna take her on single-handedly.<br> - You can't go in.<br> - [All Yelling At Once] Get away!<br> - You open this.<br> - You open this!<br> - He's won two Purple Hearts.<br> - I'm gonna ravage your body, lady!<br> - You stay away from me. I'll call the police.<br> - I have not seen such a pretty lady!<br> - You can't come in here! Who are you?<br> I'm gonna call Captain Peterson. You stay away from me!<br> - And I'm gonna swallow it and chew it!<br> - [Screams]<br> Oh! Oh!<br> - Captain Peterson, please.<br> - Captain Peterson!<br> [Mutters] [Patient Groaning]<br> What are you two hoodlums doing in this hospital?<br> Ma'am, we are surgeons, and we are here to operate.<br> We're just waiting for a starting time, that's all.<br> You can't even go near a patient until Colonel Merrill says it's okay.<br> - And he's still out to lunch.<br> - Look, Mother, I want to go to work in one hour.<br> We are the pros from Dover, and we figure to crack this kid's chest...<br> and get out to the golf course before it gets dark.<br> So you go find the gas passer, and you have him premedicate this patient.<br> Then bring me the latest pictures on him. The ones we saw must be 48 hours old by now.<br> Then call the kitchen and have them rustle us up some lunch.<br> Ham and eggs will be all right. Steak would be even better.<br> Then give me at least one nurse who knows how to...<br> work in close without getting her tits in my way.<br> [Gasps]<br> Oh! You fool!<br> How do you want your steak cooked?<br> Towel.<br> Say the magic word, you make a hundred dollars.<br> All right, I demand an explanation.<br> [Hawkeye] Somebody get that dirty old man out of this operating theater.<br> Dirty old man? I'm Colonel Merrill.<br> [Hawkeye] I don't care if you're Jack Armstrong, the all-American boy.<br> If his chest gets infected, I will tell the congressman who did it.<br> - Scissors, please.<br> - [Trapper] Here, let me have a skin "sutch."<br> Low pickups.<br> Who was that?<br> That's Colonel Merrill. This is his little store here.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Who are you?<br> I'm Dr. Jekyll, actually. This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.<br> [Grunting]<br> Listen, why don't you save your rapier-like wit for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye.<br> - Hmm.<br> - Approximator.<br> [Hawkeye] Did I ever tell you about my friend Me Lay Marston?<br> Oh, yeah, yeah, that friend of yours who would go around saying...<br> "Me Lay, you lay," to all the girls.<br> And, what, he'd score once out of 50 times, huh? Yeah, you told me about him.<br> He's passing gas for the congressman's son here.<br> Oh, really? When he's not passing gas, does he play golf?<br> I don't know. Do you play golf?<br> No. I have no time for golf.<br> I'm moonlighting down at Dr. Yamachi's New Era Hospital and Whorehouse.<br> This old guy that I met when I first came over here-<br> He's got a little crude hospital for kids,<br> and he finances it with a whorehouse, all in the same building.<br> It's the N.E.H.W.H. Come on down, and we'll get something going for you.<br> I've got an in in Kokura.<br> Here, soldier, take these.<br> Take our golf carts. Be careful.

[Howls]<br> All right, fellas. The game's over.<br> Finally caught up with us, huh?<br> [Exhales]<br> [Sighs] Where did we fail?<br> I don't know. I think it was the woman.<br> Something tells me I've seen her someplace before.<br> She was the one in Tangiers.<br> You can wait in the colonel's office.<br> He'll be back in a few minutes.<br> Sir.<br> We don't blame you.<br> You were only doing your job.<br> [Man On Radio] United Press International...<br> today voted the Korean War the top news story...<br> - of 1951.<br> - Shh!

You men are under arrest.<br> - I'll have you court-martialed.<br> - Ah, come off it, Colonel.<br> You won't have us. We have you.<br> Your boys blew this case, and we... bailed you out.<br> Now, we are going to stay here for one more day...<br> and check out the congressman's kid...<br> and... [Groans]<br> Get in some golf for ourselves.<br> If that's okay with you, then we got a deal.<br> And if it isn't, then we can always call Washington...<br> and you tell them your story, and we'll tell them ours.<br> It's simple as that. In the meantime, we are going to be...<br> at the pro shop, where we are going to have a shower and a shave.<br> If you want to get in touch with us, that is where we will be. [Pops Lips]<br> [Snickering]<br> - [Woman Speaking Japanese]<br> - [Whispering] Is that a client?<br> - [Woman] Is it? Is it?<br> - Oh, no.

We had a little carelessness around here, and the other day...<br> one of our girls presented us with an eight-pound American-Japanese boy.<br> [Chattering, Laughter]<br> Well, whatever we feed him, it either comes right back up, or he coughs and turns blue.<br> - He just has a hell of a time.<br> - We don't have to see him.<br> Just call that half-assed army hospital and tell them to get Lipiodol ready for his stomach,<br> and we'll go over and take some X-rays.<br> We can't get near that place. We can't... You know, with a civilian?<br> The colonel has a thing about it, especially a native, as he likes to...<br> [Hawkeye] Then don't tell him any more than is necessary.<br> Tell him the pros from Dover are on their way with an emergency.<br> Tell him to get the O.R. Ready, get the kid asleep,<br> and Trapper and I will fix his tracheo-esophageal fistula.<br> [Whistles]<br> Okay, Me Lay, put him down in here.<br> Get him asleep as quick as you can, will you?<br> [Nurse] Where did this baby come from?<br> - Watch him, all right?<br> - Is this what you got us up for?<br> [Hawkeye] Yeah, that's what we got you up for. We stumbled on him.<br> We don't want him, but we don't feel we can back away from him.<br> All right, this time I will not be intimidated.<br> I command that this illegal and improper use of army facilities cease immediately.<br> - On this point, I stand as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar.<br> - Me Lay.<br> [Gas Hissing] And, furthermore... You can't do-<br> What the Sam Hill are you? [Muffled Yelling]<br> - [Hawkeye] Wow.<br> - [Trapper] This one is for West Point.<br> - What the Sam Hill is going on here?<br> - That's what they all say.<br> - [Trapper] What a filthy, disgusting, despicable...<br> - [Woman Giggling]<br> [Gasps]<br> [Trapper] There's no competition to the Painless Pole, but it's pretty healthy, I think.<br> - [Colonel Shouting]<br> - Oh, Colonel, we caught you with your pants down.<br> What about the men that are fighting for our country and our land?<br> [Man On P.A.] Attention.

Come on, for crying out loud.<br> She's regular army. She's a fanatic about ritual.<br> She-She won't even let us play football.<br> - Football?<br> - [Man] Gentlemen.<br> - She's all lined up, Charlie.<br> - Yeah?<br> I-I didn't know you had a football team.<br> Well, it's pretty much in the planning stages. We've, uh...<br> No, no, we have a... we have a very fine football team.<br> Yeah? Well, we had a team back with the 325th EVAC last year.<br> - And what a team that was.<br> - Yeah, yeah. I-I coached the boys myself.<br> He's the finest coach in the Far East.<br> Yeah. Uh, we're now trying to work out a schedule...<br> of the outfits that we're going to play this year.<br> Of course, we, you know, throw a little money into a pot and make bets.<br> How much, uh... How much money do you put into your pot?<br> Oh, 5,000, 6,000.<br> [Trapper] $5,000?<br> Oh, look. You know, I don't think we're in the sort of league that you're in.<br> Well, I'm sure we can find a date when we can play your team.<br> - It can be arranged.<br> - Yeah.<br> I think I'll just talk this over with Henry, huh?<br> Thanks, boys. Thanks for the drink.<br> - Thank you.<br> - What the hell you...<br> Sir, ever since the dark days before Pearl Harbor,<br> I've been proud to wear this uniform.<br> - What the hell is this?<br> - A helicopter.<br> Hawkeye, that man has five times the manpower to draw on than we do.<br> Sure, so we get ourselves a ringer, right?<br> We get Henry to apply, make a specific application for a neurosurgeon.<br> He asks for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.<br> Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones?<br> - Oh, he's... Who is Oliver Harmon Jones?<br> - Who the hell is Harmon Jones?<br> He is better known as "Spearchucker" Jones.<br> - He's a good ballplayer.<br> - Oh, yeah!<br> - He's that Negro boy played with the 49ers, ain't he?<br> - He's incredible.<br> Sure. Yeah, sure. I remember. He's good. He's good.<br> Henry, if we had closer relations, we wouldn't have this misunderstanding, right?<br> Now, that's where a football game would help between your outfit and mine.<br> - Football game?<br> - Yeah, yeah. We put up a few bets...<br> Special Services in Tokyo says it's one of the best gimmicks we've got...<br> to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.<br> - Betting?<br> - No! Football!<br> But what about Major O'Houlihan?<br> - You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.<br> - Gee, I don't know?<br> - It's a helicopter, Charlie.<br> - I know it's a helicopter!<br> Uh, you know, you guys have one problem.<br> I just wonder about the social problem.<br> You know, I mean, he's the only Negro officer in the whole camp, you know.<br> We got a problem... Then we'll stick him in here with us, baby boy.<br> You-You're serious, ain't ya? You'd do that.<br> - Sure, I'm serious. Yeah.<br> - I... I... [Stammering]<br> It's enough for me to have to put up with you two Yankees,<br> but, you know, uh, that's-<br> Was it his wife? Uh, was that why, or was it the religious-<br> [Man] It was... It was a conditioning problem.<br> - [Woman] Why do they call you "Spearchucker"?<br> - I used to throw the javelin.<br> [Chattering]<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> All right, men, we're not here to sell lemonade. We're here to practice.<br> But first, I'd like to officially welcome Spearchucker.<br> - Is it all right to call you that?<br> - Call me whatever you want to.<br> Good. Well, I just want you to know that we're all the same here on the playing field.<br> Uh, officers and men alike. Now we're going to begin...<br> with the three basic principles...<br> organization, discipline and teamwork.<br> - Now...<br> - Pardon me. Do you mind if we limber up first?<br> Oh, that's a good idea. You organize that.<br> [Chattering]<br> Hold that line, hey! Hold that line, hey!<br> [Henry] All right, Seidman. Keep 'em pushing that, uh, whatever you call it.<br> Oh, that's good. All right, Hot Lips, keep their arms and limbs moving there.<br> [Men Yelling] Very good.<br> [Henry] Radar, you're a coach!<br> You're not a corporal. You're a coach! Keep 'em going through there.<br> - Good, Hot Lips.<br> - [Whistle Blows]<br> All right, Seidman, give 'em five. All right, men, take five.<br> Spearchucker.<br> Well, we look pretty lousy, don't we?<br> Well, for college players that have been out of training for seven or eight years, yeah, you look pretty lousy.<br> Listen, I got an idea how we can make some money.<br> We leave him out of the first half of the game.<br> We bet half our money. They roll up some points, okay?<br> Second half of the game, we stick him in. We get odds from them.<br> We bet the other half of the money, and we clean up.<br> - That's very good thinking, Captain.<br> - Yeah, it sounds good to me.<br> - Oh, and I had another idea. I think we should have some plays.<br> - I gotta get some water.<br> You know, usually in football, if you have some organized plays...<br> Well, if you don't mind, I took the liberty.<br> - Oh, you?<br> - Oh. I drew up about seven or eight plays.<br> - Oh, these are good.<br> - I think that's about all this bunch can handle.<br> Oh, very good. Yes. Oh, very, very good.<br> Uh, what are these little arrows?<br> [March]<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> - [Continues]<br> - [No Audible Dialogue]<br> Right in Smith's hands. Oh!<br> - [Continues]<br> - [No Audible Dialogue]<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> [Crowd Cheering]<br> - Well, it's only six points.<br> - Six points?<br> [All Shouting]<br> Hut!<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> - [Sighs] Oh, well. It's only one point.<br> - One point?<br> Who's Number 1? That man runs like a rabbit. We can't stop him.<br> I remember him from the pros. They call him "Super Bug."<br> - Had one year with the Rams before the army.<br> - [Duke] We can't do anything with him in there.<br> You gotta come in now. We can't wait till the second half.<br> No, no. We gotta stick to our strategy.<br> But the first thing you guys have to do is get him out of the ball game.<br> - Hey, Davidson.<br> - Yeah.<br> Let's ease up just a little bit.<br> Uh, we don't want the score too lopsided.<br> [Cheerleaders Chanting]<br> - [Houlihan] We caught it!<br> - [Crowd Shouting]<br> [Groans] [Woman] Get him! Yeah!<br> Get him!<br> [Groans] [Woman] Get him! Yeah!<br> Get him!<br> - Who's he giving it to?<br> - Isn't that Corporal Judson with the ball?<br> [Henry] Judson? Judson's a lineman! Judson can't run!<br> Look at him. He's loose. He's loose. He's...<br> [Crowd Shouting]<br> - [Whistle Blows]<br> - [Hawkeye] For crying out loud, Judson, what are you doing?<br> - [Judson] I don't know.<br> - [Trapper] What are you doing with the ball?<br> All right, come on. Let's get in a huddle.<br> You had the whole field open. What'd you go and fall down for?<br> I'm not a goddamn runner. I'm a lineman.<br> [Whistle Blows] [Man] Let's go!<br> We're gonna really clean up today. Ah.<br> Hut one, hut two!<br> [Crowd Jeering]<br> - Uh, it's only two points.<br> - Two points?<br> What the hell you think you are, a cannon?<br> [Trapper] What kind of a snap was that? We got a lot of money on this game.<br> - This is embarrassing, man.<br> - [Cheerleaders, Indistinct]<br> [Cheerleaders Continue, Indistinct]<br> [Cheerleaders] Let's go!<br> - Yea!<br> - [Dago Red] What happens now?<br> - We get a free kick.<br> - A free kick! Go!<br> [With Cheerleaders] Kick that ball! Kick that ball!<br> - Another six points.<br> - Another six points?<br> [Chattering]<br> Look. Look. He's- He's hurt. He's leaving the game.<br> He's hurt! He's hurt! He's leaving the game. He's hurt!<br> What the hell's the matter with you? Smith! Smith!<br> Goddamn bastards pulled something.<br> Hey, Coach, did I break my nine 400?<br> Four hundred? This is not a track meet, this is a football game!<br> - What the hell you think I pay you for?<br> - I gotta run the 220.<br> What? Get him up. Walk him around. Do something.<br> - I'll run the 440.<br> - 440? This is a football game, goddamn it!<br> - [Whistle Blows]<br> - [Applause]<br> All right, you guys, get in there and kill 'em!<br> All right, Bub, your fuckin' head is coming right off.<br> - I'm ready, Coach. I'm ready, Coach.<br> - Ready? For what?<br> - I'm in the broad jump, Coach.<br> - Get him back on the bench. Broad jump!<br> - Still 16-nothing.<br> - [Voice Cracks] 16-nothing.<br> Well, that's not bad. 16-nothing in the first half.<br> Guess I have to give them the old Knute Rockne at halftime.<br> - About time for the gun.<br> - Right.<br> [Gunshot]<br> Yea! [Gasping]<br> - [Whistle Blows]<br> - He runs like a mother, but how we gonna score?<br> Men, ever since the dark days before Pearl Harbor,<br> - I have been proud to wear this uniform.<br> - Boone, you got a towel?<br> - Henry, have you pressed the bets yet?<br> - Today, we are wearing...<br> - Henry, have you pressed the bets yet?<br> - Oh, the bets.<br> - Henry, press the bets, man.<br> - The bets, the bets. Finish the halftime speech.<br> [Cheerleaders] Hit 'em with a mortar! Kick 'em off the hill!<br> Mash 'em, smash 'em, kill, kill, kill!<br> Hot Lips, there's a time and a place for everything, damn it! [Gasps]<br> - Right. Bo-bo.<br> - [All] Bo-bo!<br> Come on, Smitty. Come on. [Door Closes]<br> Yeah.<br> - What's the matter with him?<br> - What's the matter? Hell, you oughta know.<br> You guys pulled something out there.<br> [Henry] Well, I guess you don't wanna double the bet.<br> Oh, the hell I don't. We were beating you without him, and we'll go on beating you.<br> Are you prepared to back that up with odds?<br> Damn right. Three-to-one. Double the bet.<br> Who's that 24? Who is he?<br> [Cheering] [Hammond] Stop it! Stop him!<br> Stop him! Stop him! Who is that guy?<br> He wasn't in the game in the first half. Stop him!<br> [No Audible Dialogue]<br> - That's "Spearchucker" Jones.<br> - "Spearchucker" who?<br> He played with San Francisco before he got drafted. Boy, he's gonna be tough to stop too.<br> Ah, Henry, you brought in a ringer, did you? Huh?<br> - Radar?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - What's the general trying to say?<br> - Didn't bring him in in the first half, did you?<br> He's just been informed as to the identity of our, uh, Spearchucker.<br> His ringer spotted our ringer.<br> How do you like them apples, Charlie?<br> You can't trust anybody.<br> Now watch him make the extra point!<br> Hut three!<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> Isn't that illegal?<br> - Relax, Charlie.<br> - What kind of team is it?<br> - Relax.<br> - They're falling around like dead flies.<br> [Crowd Cheering]<br> [Whistle Blows] [Referee] All right. Ball is down. Ball is down.<br> No piling. Let's get 'em up.<br> Look, a red flag! We've got a red flag! [Woman Screaming]<br> Hot Lips!

You'll be thrown out of the game!<br> Judson, kill him!<br> [Chattering]<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> What's wrong with you, huh? We're here to play football, not fight!<br> Bastard 88 called me a coon.<br> Called you a what?<br> - Coon.<br> - [Duke Laughs]<br> That's an old pro trick to get you thrown out of the ball game.<br> - Well...<br> - Why don't you do the same thing to him?<br> What, call him a coon?<br> No, no, the boys in camp used to talk about his sister.<br> Her name was Gladys. Use it.<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right! All right!<br> Ready, set...<br> [Man Yelling, Indistinct]<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> [Crowd Cheering]<br> - [Whistle Blowing]<br> - [Hammond] What the hell is he doing, for God's sake?<br> What's the matter here?<br> - Takin' him out.<br> - [Shouting]<br> [Crowd Cheering]<br> [Radar] Hey, you big ape!

For a team like that?<br> [Major] I did the best I could, Charlie.

Seconds to go.<br> - All right.<br> Okay, fellas. We don't have very much time left.<br> I just checked with the ref. I got a special play I wanna run, a semi-eligible play.<br> We line up with everybody to the right of the center,<br> except Hawkeye, who drops back one yard just before the snap of the ball.<br> Now, that makes you the center eligible.<br> But all you have to do is take the ball right back from Trapper between your legs...<br> and hide it under your belly and walk toward their goal line.<br> All right?<br> - Hey, Trapper.<br> - All right, come on. [Chuckles]<br> This is only one time. $5,000, all right?<br> - It's worth a try.<br> - [Hawkeye] This is a miracle if we can.<br> - I'm short. I'm short one.<br> - [Jones] What do you say? Let's do it now.<br> Ready,<br> set!<br> - What are you doing? Get back there!<br> - I got the ball.
