                        Fifty years ago<br> Paris was a light-hearted city<br> the goal of many a traveler<br> but some came not<br> for gaiety but to work<br> to study at one of the world's<br> most famous university<br> the Sorban.<br> To its lecture room and classes<br> came students<br> from all over the world<br> and among them was a young girl.<br> She was poor. She was beautiful.<br> She had left her<br> homeland and family<br> and here in Paris, she was alone<br> haunted by<br> dreams and invincibly eager<br> To go out alone into space.<br> Go out alone.<br> In one hundred years<br> one hundred students<br> but when it is time<br> for you to think<br> you, too, will be alone<br> like the author of this equation<br> like Newton<br> let us say your Galileo.<br> Probably will not be your<br> good fortune to reach the sky<br> to catch the stars<br> in your fingertips.<br> To catch a star<br> in your fingertips.<br> But this you can share with them.<br> You can learn to<br> be alone with nature<br> with the ray of light<br> piece of earth<br> drop of rain<br> you can become aware<br> that the earth's swirling<br> about the sun<br> at the rate of<br> Aware that the...<br> What... what's that?<br> You are feeling better? Sit.<br> Sit still a moment. You fainted.<br> I... Im sorry I interrupted<br> the lecture so stupidly.<br> You can get the notes<br> from some other students.<br> Your name is Marie Scholoscka?<br> Yes. You are working<br> in two master degrees.<br> One in physics and one in mathematics.<br> You passed first in the...<br> mathematical examination<br> last year.<br> What did you have to eat today?<br> Eat?<br> Yes, eat.<br> I don't remember.<br> I have some lunch.<br> What did you have?<br> Salmon. All sort of things.<br> You have a pleasant room?<br> Yes, monsieur.<br> Good.<br> What time did you have that coat<br> Come along.<br> Come along, please.<br> This is rather unusual to have no<br> friends here in Paris.<br> I have little time for friends.<br> Usually, there's some young men.<br> I'm interested in physics<br> and mathematics.<br> Yes, so am I.<br> Yet, I have a wife and a home<br> a daughter<br> and two granddaughters<br> I'm afraid<br> I will not be up to that.<br> Your desire is to<br> go back to Poland and teach?<br> Yes.<br> Your parents are still in Warsaw<br> My father is a physics professor<br> He is old.<br> When I have my degrees<br> I shall go back and live with him.<br> You love Poland.<br> Oh, yes. I love Poland.<br> Physics and<br> mathematics and Poland.<br> Yes.<br> Eat your soup.<br> Thank you very much.<br> The Society of Natural Industry<br> has asked me<br> to recommend someone<br> to make a study of the magnetic<br> property of rare steel.<br> I would be glad to recommend you<br> if you wish.<br> There would be some<br> cumbersome costs<br> I don't know exactly what.<br> Oh, it wouldn't matter.<br> Really it wouldn't.<br> I would be so grateful.<br> Of course, that our cumbersome<br> equipment too cumbersome<br> for our laboratories, I'm afraid.<br> However, I know a scientist<br> of great merit<br> who works in the school<br> of physics and chemistry.<br> Perhaps he might have<br> recommendation available.<br> Come and have tea Sunday<br> with my wife and me.<br> I will ask him to come, too.<br> You probably know his name.<br> It is Pierre Curie.<br> Oh, thank you so much. Thank you<br> You have been very kind.<br> Not at all. Not at all.<br> Good bye then. Until Sunday.<br> Sunday. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> To catch a star<br> at your fingertips.<br> Ah. Madame Poirot.<br> You are Mdme. Scholoscka.<br> I knew it.<br> Yes.<br> We've been waiting for you.<br> My husband has told me<br> all about you.<br> Ah. Professor Curie. How nice?<br> Madame.<br> You two had met?<br> Have not had the honor<br> in the hallway.<br> This is Mdme. Marie Scholoscka.<br> professor Pierre Curie.<br> My husband said<br> you have no friends in Paris<br> but that's impossible, child<br> We must remedy that.<br> Please Professor...<br> Come in. Come in.<br> I'm sure you know everyone here.<br> In Paris<br> you must have many friends.<br> I want you to meet<br> all these charming...<br> May I introduce you to...<br> This is Mdme. Scholoscka...<br> What time?<br> Always hard to meet, gentlemen.<br> Dr. Curie<br> Good afternoon.<br> I had no idea that<br> it was going to be a party.<br> No... I believe you, monsieur.<br> They're pulling up suddenly<br> these parties<br> out of the goodness of<br> women's hearts.<br> My wife wishes the young student<br> of mine to make many friends.<br> Well, I... I'm very bad<br> at parties.<br> It's impossible for me to focus.<br> My mind won't follow the<br> most simple thought.<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> You are quite alright.<br> Maybe I'll come back<br> some other day.<br> No... I want to talk to you<br> about this student of mine.<br> Perhaps we can find<br> a quiet corner<br> where we can talk.<br> Of course. Of course.<br> And as this student has<br> very little money, and is<br> I believe, extremely talented<br> I thought you might have<br> room available<br> at physics and chemistry.<br> Oh, I should be very glad.<br> Unfortunately at the moment<br> we are extremely<br> crowded ourselves.<br> In that case...<br> However, my workroom is<br> quite large.<br> I would hesitate to ask you<br> to share your own laboratory...<br> I have shared it<br> with students before.<br> You have?<br> Yes, and some of them were<br> very quiet and pleasant.<br> On the other hand<br> one fellow was most troublesome.<br> He used to whistle constantly.<br> Well, I can assure you that<br> this student is very serious.<br> Then I should be very happy.<br> I think you will find that<br> she is very sincere.<br> She?<br> Oh, my God.<br> These are my granddaughters.<br> Excuse me.<br> But...<br> Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle.<br> Bon Appetit. A coffee?<br> Yes, thank you. Tea.<br> That's coffee.<br> That's coffee, too.<br> Oh.<br> Please sit down, everybody.<br> Sit down. Wait a moment.<br> Come along... children.<br> It's time for your performance.<br> Would you excuse them, Dr. Curie.<br> They are going to play the piano.<br> Come along... There they are.<br> This is the student of whom<br> we were speaking.<br> Mme. Scholoscka.<br> Dr. Pierre Curie.<br> We have already met.<br> Dr. Curie is gracious<br> in consenting<br> for you to work<br> in his laboratory<br> I am very grateful.<br> Of course, I have no idea<br> that is...<br> Would you sit down, Madame?<br> Oh, would you please excuse me.<br> I feel my grandchildren are about<br> to entertain.<br> Would you care for tea?<br> Thank you. I've just had some.<br> It's coffee.<br> I appreciate very deeply<br> Dr. Curie<br> the privilege of working in<br> your laboratory.<br> Playing incredibly badly<br> don't you think?<br> Very badly, Dr. Curie.<br> Of course, I'm no judge.<br> Professor Poirot is an<br> excellent scientist.<br> Oh, good morning, Dr. Curie.<br> Good morning, David.<br> The furnace is taken down<br> and I'm beginning to set up<br> for room temperature readings.<br> I have the sulphates<br> all ready for you.<br> Thank you.<br> No one has arrived yet?<br> Here at the laboratory? Yes.<br> No, sir.<br> Are you expecting someone?<br> Well, a pupil of Dr. Poirot<br> who's going to do some work here<br> for a short time.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Her name is Marie Sc...<br> Funny, I was introduced<br> to her twice.<br> Scholoscka.<br> She's a girl.<br> I didn't find out in time.<br> Always the continuous struggle<br> against woman, David<br> When we wish to give<br> all our thoughts to some work<br> which is strangest to humanity<br> we always have to<br> struggle against woman.<br> Yes, sir. And women scientists<br> are particularly unattractive<br> I find, sir<br> Women's love in life is the<br> living of it.<br> In the world of<br> abstract research<br> she's a danger, destruction.<br> She's a natural enemy of science<br> There's no doubt of it, sir.<br> Woman and science are<br> incompatible.<br> Woman of genius are rare.<br> No true scientist<br> can have anything with women.<br> No, sir.<br> Anyway, David, put her over there<br> in that far corner.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And if you can<br> without being rude<br> inform her how important silence<br> is to laboratory work.<br> I do hope she doesn't whistle.<br> Oh, David.<br> Would you mind going to<br> the storeroom upstairs<br> and see<br> if there's a magnetometer.<br> She'll need<br> one for her experiments.<br> Oh, yes.<br> I... I'm very sorry, sir.<br> I beg your pardon<br> are you looking for something?<br> Yes. I'm looking for<br> Dr. Curie's laboratory.<br> You're here. But you're not...<br> I mean you can't be...<br> Excuse me, please.<br> No. You don't understand.<br> You see<br> I'm Dr. Curie's assistant.<br> Oh... then you can direct me.<br> Oh, I certainly can.<br> Certainly can.<br> Oh, just this way.<br> Thank you.<br> What do you think of that?<br> I run into you the first thing.<br> You know, Dr. Curie has asked me<br> look out for you.<br> Be sure to have<br> everything you want<br> so I'll just take everything<br> into my own hands.<br> Oh, here we are.<br> Here she is, Dr. Curie.<br> Run straight<br> into her the first day.<br> Oh. Good morning, Mademoiselle.<br> Good morning, Dr. Curie.<br> This time we met in rather a<br> less rude atmosphere.<br> Yes.<br> Well<br> that's just as it should be.<br> People interested in work<br> should be left alone.<br> You have met my assistant?<br> Yes. I don't think<br> I quite caught his name.<br> David. David Lagroue.<br> I'm sure that<br> David will see that<br> you're properly installed.<br> Thank you, Dr. Curie.<br> I appreciate this chance<br> more than I can say.<br> Not at all<br> Not at all, Mademoiselle<br> and I do hope<br> you'll be quite comfortable.<br> Over this way.<br> We picked out<br> a specially nice place<br> for you right over here.<br> You're going to have this<br> far corner all to yourself.<br> Of course<br> we would have it fixed up<br> for you had we known sooner<br> that you were coming<br> but we'll take care of<br> that right away.<br> How do you think<br> this is going to suit you?<br> Oh. It is excellent.<br> I understand you're a pupil of<br> Professor Poirot's?<br> Yes.<br> I've studied with him, too.<br> Wonderful isn't he?<br> Yes, he is. Oh, I'll give you<br> a little more light.<br> Please don't bother.<br> Oh, Dr. Curie wants you<br> to be comfortable.<br> I'm sorry, Dr. Curie.<br> Here's a paper and pencil.<br> You can make out a list for<br> all the things you need,<br> and I'll go and see<br> if I can get<br> a magnetometer for you.<br> Oh, I can take my coat off?<br> Oh. It's always<br> the way you should.<br> Your hat?<br> I'll hide it up<br> at the cupboard for you<br> I'm sorry, Dr. Curie.<br> Let me help you.<br> Thank you.<br> You know<br> my office is just upstairs.<br> I hope you won't<br> hesitate to call on me<br> if I can be of any assistance.<br> You're very kind.<br> You sure everything's alright?<br> Quite. Thank you.<br> Not at all.<br> If there is anything you'd like<br> to know about our equipment<br> I'd be glad to explain it to you<br> I want to give you some advice<br> on where to eat around here.<br> There's a very nice<br> little restaurant down...<br> Really, monsieur.<br> I don't think we should talk.<br> Why are you whispering?<br> I just think<br> you ought to know where to go.<br> Yes, but I...<br> I'll take you there later.<br> That's the best way and<br> It's too trouble.<br> Oh, no trouble at all.<br> I'll come back for you.<br> Good evening, Mademoiselle.<br> Good evening, Dr. Curie.<br> Miserable evening, hasn't it?<br> Yes, isn't it.<br> Oh, by the way<br> did David get you the<br> telescope scale<br> you asked for last week<br> Oh, yes. Thank you very much.<br> He finally look into it.<br> Good... Well, good evening.<br> But you have no umbrella<br> Mademoiselle<br> No, I haven't, Dr. Curie.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't realize.<br> Perhaps I can help you.<br> Oh, I don't want to trouble you.<br> Allow me. No trouble at all.<br> No trouble at all.<br> Thank you.<br> You're very kind.<br> Not at all, Mademoiselle.<br> May I ask you another question<br> Dr. Curie<br> in the same connection?<br> It's a simple matter, perhaps<br> but it puzzles me.<br> Yes, Mademoiselle?<br> In the semetry<br> L sub-Q and two L sub-Q<br> you include only those rotations<br> which are integral multiples<br> of two Pi L Q.<br> But two times<br> K over Q exclude<br> the identity transformation<br> if K is not an integer.<br> Yes. For final case, I guess.<br> But in a limited L sub infinity<br> a difficult seems to arise.<br> I don't see why it's<br> quite straightforward.<br> Well, if you consider the<br> matter rigorously...<br> Hmm. I have to look into that.<br> This is where I lived.<br> Good bye and thank you.<br> Of course...<br> Oh, good bye, mademoiselle.<br> And may I say your conversation<br> is very simplely<br> Thank you.<br> It's an extremely<br> dawning hypothesis.<br> Good morning, Mademoiselle.<br> Good morning, Dr. Curie.<br> I'm a little late this morning.<br> I have to stop<br> in at my publishers.<br> Oh.<br> To Mme. Scholoscka<br> my respect and<br> friendship of honor...<br> friendship of honor.<br> My book.<br> Oh, it's lovely.<br> One of the first copy<br> just off the press.<br> On semitry and<br> physical phenomena<br> Semitry of Electric Field<br> and of Magnetic Field<br> by Pierre curie.<br> That's something to be proud of.<br> I thought perhaps you might<br> like a copy.<br> Oh, I would very much.<br> Well, it's yours. It's yours<br> Mademoiselle.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Not at all.<br> I've inscribed the book for you<br> mademoiselle<br> on the ply leaf.<br> I believe<br> that's the usual procedure.<br> I'm very flattered.<br> Not at all...<br> Come in. Oh, Dr. Becquerel.<br> I hope I'm not intruding<br> Dr. Curie.<br> But could you step over<br> my laboratory with me?<br> I think I've happened on something<br> of great interest.<br> Why? What is it?<br> Are you too busy to...?<br> Oh, no... Not at all.<br> I'll come at once.<br> Oh, aren't you coming<br> Mademoiselle?<br> Well, if I may?<br> You don't mind...<br> No. No. I'll be delighted.<br> I came upon it quite by accident<br> I think you'll agree that it is<br> very extraordinary...<br> What is this thing...<br> Well, what did you see?<br> You have taken<br> the picture of a key apparently.<br> Yes, the picture of a key.<br> But that picture<br> of a key was taken...<br> in a very extraordinary manner.<br> The picture of that key<br> was taken<br> in complete and total darkness<br> without light of any kind.<br> But, how was that possible?<br> Some months ago<br> I had the idea that perhaps<br> certain rocks and minerals<br> might store applied energy<br> from the sun<br> that if I left<br> the rocks and minerals<br> in the sun long enough<br> they might absorbed<br> some of its rays<br> and then later, give them out.<br> So I make some<br> photographic experiments<br> You see these rocks<br> they're all different kinds<br> of minerals<br> I labeled them as you see<br> and left them outside<br> in the sun for several hours.<br> Then I put them in this drawer<br> on photographic plates like this<br> and then I waited to see<br> if they would give out<br> any sunlight<br> they might have absorbed.<br> I see. And your experiment<br> was a success.<br> To the contrary, my experiment<br> was a complete failure.<br> Not one of the rocks<br> I have exposed to the sun<br> affected the plates in anyway.<br> See, there they are.<br> They're all black<br> every one of them.<br> Then how did you explain...<br> Now, look at this one, please.<br> That has been exposed<br> am I right?<br> Light has reached<br> Oh, yes. That has been exposed.<br> This plate was lying<br> in this drawer quite by accident.<br> I didn't even know it was there.<br> It's the drawer that I keep<br> some of my specimens in.<br> And when I was putting my rocks<br> back into the drawer<br> one of them must have fallen<br> on this plate<br> without my knowing it.<br> I discovered it yesterday.<br> This is the rock that<br> I have not yet exposed to the sun<br> it's a piece of mineral<br> called pitch blende.<br> To be sure<br> there could be no mistake<br> last night I myself<br> hide in this room<br> in complete darkness.<br> Took this rock, which had never<br> been exposed to the sun<br> and placed it<br> on a photographic plate.<br> I put this metal key<br> between the stone<br> and the plate like this<br> so that it would be photographed<br> if any light rays<br> came from the stone.<br> Half hour ago<br> I developed the plate.<br> This is the result.<br> You mean, then, that...<br> there is something about that rock<br> that gives off rays of its own.<br> Rays powerful enough to go<br> through black paper<br> and affect this photographic plate.<br> That, Monsieur, must be so.<br> Incredible.<br> It is incredible.<br> It's as if they were<br> a piece of the sun<br> locked up in here.<br> Strange. Very strange.<br> What could it be? What could be<br> the nature of radiation?<br> What could be the origin of it?<br> Perhaps we shall never know.<br> It was very kind of you<br> to take me<br> to Dr. Becquerel's laboratory.<br> Not at all...<br> Dr. Curie<br> I want to thank you<br> also for allowing me<br> to do my experiments here<br> in your laboratory.<br> I couldn't have done this<br> if it weren't<br> for Natural Science Industry<br> for allowing me of your kindness.<br> You finished that already?<br> Yes, I had to do it quickly<br> because I should not<br> have much time from now on<br> to come to the laboratory.<br> Why? What do you mean?<br> From now on, I shall spend<br> most of my time studying.<br> My examination's coming up<br> in less than two weeks, you know.<br> So soon? I haven't realized.<br> Yes. I have been here<br> six months.<br> It's the middle of June.<br> The term is nearly over.<br> How fast it goes.<br> Yes.<br> You know a short time ago<br> that tree was a skeleton.<br> I always used to look forward<br> to my summer in my country<br> but I'm only there<br> at stray moments now<br> when I go to visit my parents.<br> They have this small place<br> outside of Paris at Sol.<br> I used to take long walks<br> towards the woods there<br> with my brother, Jacques.<br> So nice to be walking<br> in the country.<br> My father loves to walk.<br> Your father?<br> Is he here in Paris?<br> Oh, no. In Warsaw<br> but we get out of the city<br> now and then.<br> Warsaw. But you're not thinking<br> going to Warsaw.<br> Of course.<br> But when?<br> As soon as<br> I finished my examinations.<br> But for how long?<br> Why for... Why, Dr. Curie.<br> You forget that if I passed<br> my examinations<br> I'm going back to Poland<br> to teach.<br> Well, I knew that...<br> wish I knew when we first came,<br> but everything is changed now.<br> You are making experiments<br> of your own<br> I know it.<br> I shall miss Paris, too.<br> But this is absurd, fantastic.<br> Why, it never occurred to me.<br> Oh, I...<br> I haven't planned on this at all.<br> How could you dream of<br> doing such a thing<br> abandoning science<br> when your making such progress.<br> My father is getting old.<br> He misses me.<br> If you stay on in Poland<br> you can't possibly go on<br> with your studies.<br> Anyone can teach<br> but you can do more<br> much more.<br> You have a talent<br> a definite talent<br> and it's your duty to use it.<br> We've so much to be done<br> so much to<br> that's still undreamed of.<br> Oh, Mademoiselle.<br> I beg you to reconsider.<br> Why, that's very kind of you<br> Dr. Curie<br> I'm really flattered.<br> I'm afraid<br> I can't give up the entire plan<br> that I have had for so long.<br> I thought, of course, you knew.<br> I do not understand<br> how anyone<br> with a scientific mind<br> can entertain the thought of<br> abandoning science.<br> I know.<br> But there are other things<br> that are important, too.<br> Dr. Curie?<br> Yes, Mademoiselle.<br> I've been meaning to ask you.<br> I supposed you wouldn't care<br> to attend my graduation?<br> Well, I should enjoy very much<br> seeing you get your degree<br> but, well, I have, ah...<br> there's such a crowd always.<br> Of course...<br> I understand perfectly.<br> I feel exactly<br> the same way myself.<br> Well<br> I should be coming in again<br> of course to see to a few things<br> Good bye, Dr. Curie.<br> Good bye, Mademoiselle.<br> We may well expect to hear<br> again and again.<br> It will always be<br> interested for you to look back<br> and try to recall<br> the personality of...<br> your classmate<br> who have won faith.<br> Above all<br> it's the mother of learning<br> And her children come through<br> all the corners of the world.<br> They come, they are nourished<br> and then<br> they returned to their homeland<br> to impart what<br> they have instilled to others.<br> Pride is not deflated by<br> what they take away.<br> The whole world is in fact<br> enriched by what they learned.<br> And am proud in particular gained<br> more than she gives<br> to the very earnest students.<br> Professor Constance, chairman of<br> the committee on scholarship<br> has gone over all the awards<br> and will read the name<br> of the successful candidates.<br> It is my pleasure to introduce<br> Professor Constance.<br> The names of those who have been<br> awarded degrees<br> will be read<br> in the order of merit.<br> For the degree<br> the master of physics.<br> First...<br> Marie Scholoscka.<br> Hello, Dr. Curie.<br> Oh, hello, David.<br> Isn't she wonderful?<br> First place in physics.<br> Did you know we have that<br> all that time in the laboratory?<br> Yes. It's very gratifying.<br> Here she was bright...<br> You haven't seen any of<br> Mmde. Scholoscka, have you, David?<br> Yes, I saw her.<br> Had a nice talk with her.<br> Congratulated her and everything.<br> She went straight home.<br> Had some packing to do.<br> Packing?<br> Well, she's leaving for Poland<br> on Tuesday.<br> Oh.<br> Good bye, Dr. Curie. Oh.<br> Awfully glad I run into you.<br> Good bye, David.<br> Ah! Dr. Curie.<br> How do you do, Professor?<br> Lovely, wasn't it?<br> Packing.<br> Yes... Wasn't it lovely?<br> Come in...<br> Dr. Curie.<br> How do you do?<br> I missed you at the<br> Graduation Exercises.<br> I looked all over for you.<br> You were there?<br> Yes.<br> Then you heard.<br> Yes. My congratulation<br> Mademoiselle.<br> Thank you. You know, I was...<br> never dreamed that I would...<br> I was even afraid that I might<br> may not...<br> Oh, I'm glad you were able to go.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> Thank you<br> I met David and he told me that<br> you were leaving Poland<br> on Tuesday<br> Yes.<br> I see.<br> Then you haven't reconsider<br> Mademoiselle.<br> I'm afraid not.<br> Of course. Of course.<br> Perhaps you might have.<br> You were packing?<br> Yes.<br> Oh, yes... naturally.<br> Well, then...<br> since you are leaving<br> so soon on Tuesday<br> I presume there'd be no time for<br> something I had in mind,<br> that is...<br> my father...<br> He is a doctor, you know.<br> He is very short only, you know.<br> but intelligent.<br> And my mother is quite gay.<br> I think you'd enjoy knowing<br> both of them.<br> But of course that would be<br> impossible<br> because you'd be busy packing and<br> doing one thing or another.<br> I had meant to<br> ask you down before<br> but it slipped my mind.<br> Still, I thought it would be nice<br> for you to take away with you<br> some of Paris' countryside<br> since we were speaking of<br> the country<br> the last time I saw you<br> that perhaps you might like<br> to come with me<br> to spend the weekend there.<br> It's not far<br> but still it's impossible<br> I see, because, I said before<br> you'd be busy packing<br> and preparing for your journey.<br> Yes, the idea's preposterous<br> on the face of it.<br> The idea is not<br> preposterous at all.<br> I should like to come very much.<br> You would?<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Well, then.<br> Well, then.<br> I hate that girl.<br> Eugene.<br> I still hate that girl.<br> What do you do in Poland, anyway?<br> Spend all your time<br> at this stupid game<br> You must not mind my husband.<br> He never shouts at anyone<br> unless he likes them.<br> That's what I thought.<br> He had been shouting at me<br> all my life.<br> Well, what are looking<br> so gloomy about, Pierre.<br> It's your shot.<br> Ah, yes. Excuse me.<br> I heard you're going to Poland<br> on Tuesday.<br> Say, Monsieur.<br> Excellent country, Poland.<br> Thank you.<br> Of course, he hasn't been there.<br> You don't have to be there<br> to know<br> it's an excellent country.<br> Well, what are you waiting for.<br> Hit it. Hit it.<br> Well, I dare say<br> it's the best thing you can do.<br> You can go on<br> with your studies there.<br> Of course, not with a degree that<br> you could get here,<br> but you will do well<br> whatever it is.<br> Thank you, Madame.<br> I'm not paying you compliments.<br> I'm only telling you what I see<br> in your face.<br> It's all there<br> in people's faces.<br> Look at my husband.<br> A good man and a good doctor.<br> Look at Pierre.<br> A poet, but a poet with brains.<br> A poet in the laboratory.<br> Look at me, fat and foolish<br> but quite a good old soul.<br> It's true. Why should I mind.<br> Look at Monsieur and me.<br> Mitchell there<br> and young Master Mitchell.<br> We'll let them pass.<br> But then, look at yours.<br> Stubborn, determined, abstinent<br> and of course, intelligent.<br> And then, there's something else<br> that I can't quite<br> give a name to. Fiery, is it?<br> No... Flame-like.<br> That's a little nearer.<br> Flame-like then.<br> Something like a flame.<br> Once I'm sure I won<br> and what with that strike of<br> yours supposed I get out of it.<br> You're not paying attention.<br> It's no credit beating anyone<br> who does not pay attention.<br> Why, I tried to, Father.<br> Then you're just plain stupid.<br> Oh. Leave him alone.<br> No, sir. That boy has got to<br> learn to concentrate.<br> He'll never get anywhere<br> if he doesn't concentrate.<br> Did you ever hear<br> the fundamental law of physics,<br> known oddly enough as Curie's Law<br> Sheer luck.<br> I don't know how Pierre<br> ever stumbled on to it.<br> Oh, do be quiet, Eugene.<br> Croquet always makes me thirsty.<br> Want to drink?<br> Thank you, Father.<br> Yes,<br> that croquet always makes me thirsty.<br> Yes, it stirs up the thirst<br> in a man.<br> Nothing like a good drink<br> of lemonade<br> after a fast game of croquet<br> don't you think so, Pierre.<br> There.<br> I think you'll be comfortable here.<br> I'm sure I will.<br> This is Jacques' room<br> when he was home<br> Pierre's brother, you know.<br> Oh, there he is.<br> Where.<br> Oh, that. That's Pierre.<br> Oh, no. Really?<br> The other two are doctors<br> of course.<br> Crazy looking group.<br> I think it's charming.<br> Well. I hope you rest well.<br> Thank you. And thank you for<br> the lovely day.<br> I'd been very happy and...<br> You're very welcome, my dear.<br> If you care to<br> postpone your travel to Poland<br> we'd love to have you<br> stay with us for time.<br> It is very kind of you.<br> I like very much to stay<br> but I've already<br> written to my father<br> and he'd be expecting me.<br> It's no use, Mother, to talk<br> Mdme. Scholoscka<br> of staying on in Paris<br> It seems that she's determined to<br> return to Poland,<br> and apparently as far as<br> she is concerned<br> science is to be forgotten.<br> I did try to explain to you<br> why I have to return to Poland.<br> I thought you've understood.<br> I do understand and I'm sorry.<br> Well, good night, my dear.<br> Good night, Madame Curie.<br> Good night, Mademoiselle.<br> Pierre, you shouldn't<br> have spoken to her like that.<br> She's a very obstinate girl<br> Mother.<br> After all, Poland is her home.<br> What's that?<br> I'm just saying to Mother<br> she is a very obstinate girl.<br> Hmm, stubborn.<br> Exactly. That's what I mean.<br> Stubborn as they come.<br> Saw that the first minute<br> I clap her eyes on her.<br> Won't listen to reason.<br> Closes her mind like a clam.<br> Well, let's go to bed.<br> Good night, Mother.<br> Good night, son.<br> Good night, Father.<br> Good night, Pierre.<br> She's so intelligent about<br> other things<br> Good night.<br> Blind as a bat.<br> Who? Your son.<br> Mdme. Scholoscka...<br> What is it? What's happened?<br> Is anything wrong?<br> Dr. Curie.<br> I find it impossible for you to<br> leave Paris.<br> But what?<br> Please. I must talk to you.<br> I found myself in<br> a very peculiar position.<br> During these past two weeks<br> when you haven't<br> been to the laboratory<br> I found everything very confusing<br> It's impossible to do my work.<br> In short, I find it impossible to<br> go on without you.<br> But now, suddenly...<br> something has become<br> very clear to me.<br> I am helpful to you<br> in the laboratory, am I not?<br> Am I not? Didn't you say that?<br> Yes, of course.<br> A few times, I've been able to<br> give you suggestions<br> which you've found valuable<br> Of course.<br> Well, then, now.<br> Where as I was inclined to<br> be nervous and impatient<br> you were quite the opposite.<br> You have a clear mind<br> you were tenacious<br> you would never give up.<br> It's an excellent combination.<br> I might compare it with<br> the chemical formula NACI<br> Sodium Chloride.<br> It's a stable necessary compound.<br> So if we marry on this basis<br> our marriage would always<br> be the same.<br> The temperature would be the same<br> the composition would be the same<br> There would be no destruction<br> no fluctuation<br> none of the<br> uncertainties and emotions of love.<br> But...<br> I know how you feel about love<br> about men<br> I mean<br> and I respect that feeling.<br> It's also my own conviction.<br> For the scientist<br> there is no time for love.<br> I always believe science and<br> marriage to be incompatible<br> but it's stupid to believe<br> in generalization.<br> In our case, it would be a<br> wonderful collaboration.<br> A wonderful collaboration.<br> Don't you feel that?<br> I feel that.<br> And as for your father<br> from what you've said<br> I'm sure he would applaud<br> such a collaboration.<br> He might.<br> And as for Poland<br> what little good<br> you could make there,<br> you could make up here ten fold<br> on your own ground science.<br> What do you think I should do?<br> It would be a very fine thing<br> I believe<br> to pass our lives together<br> with our common scientific dream<br> to work together constantly<br> in our search<br> and any discovery that<br> we should make<br> no matter how small<br> would deepen the friendship<br> that we already have<br> for each other<br> and increase the respect that<br> we mutually feel.<br> I can imagine no respect<br> or friendship<br> greater than I have for you now.<br> I can imagine no future<br> so full of promise<br> than the one you offer.<br> Then I suggest that you stay<br> on in Paris with me.<br> I think you are right.<br> I should like to stay<br> in Paris very much.<br> Thank you.<br> We are engaged.<br> Engaged?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, Pierre.<br> I'm so happy.<br> Oh. So very happy.<br> And I'm, too, my boy.<br> Very happy<br> Thank you, Mother.<br> Thank you, Father.<br> Oh, Pierre. I am so glad.<br> Good night, Mother.<br> Good night, father.<br> Good night, my boy.<br> Good night. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Quiet, please...<br> Chaplain. Quiet, please.<br> Now, look right here, please<br> and hold absolutely still until<br> I count to ten.<br> Still.<br> One and two and three<br> and four and five<br> and six and seven and eight<br> and nine and ten.<br> How I wish you happiness<br> Mme. Curie.<br> Oh, David. Thank you.<br> You're the first one<br> who's called me that.<br> Good bye, Mme. Curie<br> and bon voyage.<br> Thank you, mademoiselle.<br> Good bye, my dear Marie.<br> Oh, Father dear. Good bye.<br> Oh, congratulations, lad.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Congratulations.<br> Thank you, David. Bye. Bye.<br> Excuse me.<br> Now, where can I put<br> this chicken?<br> Mother<br> we don't need anymore food.<br> We're not going at the jungle.<br> Good gracious<br> what's this, Pierre?<br> What do you want the science book<br> on your honeymoon?<br> We want to read them, Mother.<br> Well, this is the last straw.<br> Mother, we want those books.<br> The chicken will do you fine<br> I assure you.<br> Science books on your honeymoon!<br> My boy, good bye.<br> Good bye.<br> Ready, Marie? Here they go...<br> You're very lovely, Marie.<br> Thank you, Pierre.<br> Music is lovely, isn't it?<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Pierre.<br> Yes.<br> Would you hate to get back?<br> In a way, although I have a lot<br> of work that I must do.<br> What should I work on, Pierre?<br> What subject should I choose for<br> my doctors degree?<br> Is there anything that<br> particularly interests you?<br> Oh, yes. Yes, a number of things<br> but...<br> What is it? Why did you stop?<br> Oh, nothing.<br> It's just an idea that<br> went through my mind.<br> Well, what was it?<br> Do you remember that<br> Professor Becquerel showed us that rock<br> The pitch blende and the plate he<br> exposed to it?<br> Yes.<br> You know, Pierre.<br> I can't get that out of my mind.<br> Really? Why?<br> I know it's true<br> that the rays give...<br> not by something<br> in the pitch blende<br> I can't get over the feeling<br> that there's more to it than that<br> that there's something else<br> something beyond<br> Becquerel's explanation.<br> I don't quite understand.<br> Well, what are these rays<br> that given off<br> and why are they being given off.<br> It's an accepted principle<br> in science<br> that nothing can go on forever<br> without running dull, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> I mean, the clock will run dull<br> if it isn't wound.<br> Afire would burn out if it's not<br> replenished.<br> Life will die if it is inflate.<br> Yet in these rocks<br> which are embedded<br> in the middle of the earth<br> millions of years<br> never seen the sun<br> Rays are constantly given off<br> more all by themselves.<br> What is this energy?<br> Where does it come from?<br> I supposed<br> I'm being very foolish.<br> Some of the greatest achievements<br> in science<br> come to the same type<br> of foolishness.<br> When an explanation is given<br> of something<br> and every one believes it<br> there may be one person somewhere<br> who can't quite accept it,<br> who instinctively says<br> I'm not sure that<br> this is sufficient explanation.<br> Maybe something beyond this.<br> It's that<br> kind of foolishness, Marie.<br> Well, I'm not that person<br> I'm sure.<br> How do you know? Perhaps you are<br> Perhaps Dr. Becquerel has only<br> set the gate a jar.<br> Maybe a long<br> and unexplored road ahead<br> I wouldn't even know how to start<br> Pierre.<br> I wouldn't know what to do.<br> I'm very glad we're married<br> to each other, Pierre.<br> Darling.<br> Hello, Marie.<br> My class kept me the day<br> with the most stupid questions.<br> Thought I would never get away.<br> Just tonight<br> when we're having guests.<br> I have a terrible problem.<br> I hope I got the things<br> you wanted me to get.<br> I lost the slip that<br> I made the notes on<br> and I couldn't remember<br> whether there was turnips<br> or carrots, so I got both.<br> Mother likes carrots<br> and Father likes turnips.<br> And here's some flowers<br> for the cook.<br> Thank you, Pierre.<br> What's the matter, Marie?<br> Oh, Pierre. I'm so discouraged.<br> Looks like this method of mine<br> is all wrong.<br> I wonder if I'm trying something<br> beyond me.<br> What is it exactly that's wrong?<br> I don't know.<br> My measurements.<br> they don't mean anything.<br> I know I must be making mistakes<br> some where...<br> but I don't know where it is.<br> I checked them and<br> I rechecked them two hundred times.<br> Maybe the electrometer<br> is not working right.<br> That's what I'm afraid of.<br> I wish you'd examine it for me<br> Pierre<br> I'll go over it tomorrow.<br> Let's forget it tonight.<br> Let's not talk, not even<br> think the laboratory<br> Promise?<br> I promise.<br> Well, Pierre. What is it?<br> Marie, about those measurements.<br> Do you think<br> anything could have happened<br> to change the capacity<br> of the electrometer?<br> Weren't we suppose to forget<br> the laboratory tonight?<br> Oh. I forgot. I'm sorry.<br> No more... Im terribly sorry.<br> Here they are.<br> Where's my coat?<br> Here we are.<br> Hello, dear. Pierre.<br> Mother.<br> I smell turnips.<br> We got carrots for you.<br> Oh, how sweet of you.<br> Oh, I brought you<br> some of my new plum jelly.<br> Thank you, Mother.<br> She made it but I brought it.<br> Ah, thank you, Father.<br> Let me have your things.<br> Your coat, Father?<br> Yeah. You're not<br> treating her right, Pierre.<br> She looks pinkish.<br> Oh, it's silly.<br> Why you look lovely, dear.<br> Just the same, she's too thin.<br> And I say a woman without a child<br> is a parasite.<br> She feeds on life<br> but is not willing to<br> give life in return.<br> What is being her excuse<br> to have life.<br> Why would she ever born?<br> She's a blood sucker.<br> Now, don't call names, George.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> Of course.<br> A woman without a child<br> is a blood sucker.<br> We didn't mean you, my dear.<br> Oh, yes.<br> She's just the one I did mean.<br> But I'm going to have a child.<br> When?<br> Soon, I hope.<br> Oh, my dear. Marie.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Look who's going to say something<br> at last.<br> Are you sure the insulation is dry?<br> Yes, Pierre.<br> He's getting quite chatty lately<br> isn't he?<br> Don't bother them.<br> They're thinking of something.<br> I don't believe it.<br> Did you check<br> the ground connection?<br> I don't know.<br> I thought you gave it to me<br> in good order.<br> Well, sometimes it work loose<br> and you don't notice it.<br> Pierre, that could be possible<br> couldn't it?<br> Yes. Yes, of course.<br> The thing we must do is to check<br> that line completely<br> from one end to the other.<br> In that case<br> my measurements may be correct.<br> Yes.<br> Then all these months of work<br> couldn't have been wrong<br> after all.<br> That's right.<br> Pierre, that's it.<br> That must be it...<br> Yes, that must be it.<br> Alright. Alright.<br> Go ahead and check it.<br> Father, it's just that, well<br> Marie has so many setbacks<br> with her work.<br> That's alright.<br> Don't stop doing...<br> Please. Go ahead.<br> It's just that I've been<br> waiting for so many months.<br> It's alright, my dear.<br> I hope you won't mind<br> if I stay long enough<br> to finish my coffee.<br> Please do and we'll try to<br> get back before you go.<br> Thank you, my boy. Thank you.<br> Good bye.<br> You know, sometimes that son of<br> yours is not quite all right.<br> Nice having dinner with you.<br> You know, I'll never<br> come to this house<br> but for the sake...<br> It's Alright, George.<br> It happens every time.<br> Well?<br> It's alright.<br> Nothing wrong with it.<br> I was wrong.<br> I was sure we've found it.<br> Well...<br> I don't know. I'm sorry.<br> You tested all of the elements.<br> you're sure of that, Marie?<br> Yes, I'm positive, Pierre.<br> And you found that<br> only two of them...<br> uranium and thorium<br> gave off rays.<br> That's right.<br> Then<br> you measured the uranium and thorium<br> in the pitch blende ore.<br> And that's when I run<br> into trouble.<br> The pitch blende has more<br> radioactivity than I can explained<br> by the amount of<br> uranium and thorium had in it.<br> Would you like to show me<br> how you make your measurements<br> Marie?<br> You wouldn't mind?<br> Of course not.<br> Alright.<br> Here is what I've done<br> so many times that I lost count.<br> Here is crude pitch blende.<br> Now we know that<br> the rays came from the uranium<br> and thorium that are<br> in this pitch blende.<br> Those two elements<br> give off the rays.<br> Correct.<br> I put the pitch blende<br> in this mortar.<br> Has the mortar always been clean?<br> Always and grinded up.<br> Here is the ground pitch blende<br> throw in the uranium<br> and thorium in it<br> I also fill a disk level full.<br> Just like what I've done<br> every time.<br> Then I placed it<br> in the electrometer.<br> And I close the case<br> so there is no draft.<br> Good.<br> I charged the electrometer.<br> Now I will find out<br> how much energy to raise<br> in the pitch blende they have<br> is it right?<br> Right. Start.<br> Ready. Read.<br> Eight.<br> Eight.<br> Same reading as I always had.<br> This pitch blende<br> with the uranium and the thorium<br> still in it comes to eight.<br> Now, here is pure uranium<br> I strike it<br> in the same amount of pitch blende.<br> This is exactly the same case<br> close the case<br> charged the electrometer<br> Now, we will find out<br> how much energy<br> the rays in the uranium have.<br> Right.<br> Ready. Read.<br> Two, same as always.<br> Done nothing wrong so far.<br> Not that I can see.<br> We know then that...<br> the pitch blende with<br> the uranium and thorium in it<br> comes to eight and that<br> the uranium alone reads two.<br> I am going to test the thorium.<br> From the same amount of pitch blende?<br> Of course, and put in exactly<br> the same case<br> close the case<br> charged the electrometer.<br> Now we find out how much energy<br> the rays in thorium have?<br> Right.<br> Ready. Read.<br> Two<br> I don't understand.<br> There must be a mistake.<br> When the uranium and thoarum are<br> in the pitch blende<br> the reading is eight.<br> But individually<br> they only total four.<br> Have you checked<br> all the other elements<br> in the pitch blende?<br> I checked every elements.<br> There is no the result.<br> Every elements in existence.<br> Uranium and thorium are<br> the only elements that give off rays.<br> Why do they give off twice<br> as much when they are<br> in the pitch blende as they do<br> as they were tested separately?<br> Where are those<br> four missing points?<br> That is what I don't understand.<br> I don't understand.<br> You make the chemical analysis of<br> what is content<br> in the pitch blende, didn't you?<br> Of course. Could I see it?<br> Yes.<br> Uranium oxide - 75%<br> Chlorium Oxide - 13%<br> Lead sulfide - 3%<br> Silicon dioxide - 2%<br> Calcium oxide - 3%<br> Barium oxide - 2%<br> Iron oxide - 1%<br> Magnesium oxide - 1/990%<br> other extraneous elements<br> Pierre Yes?<br> Our universe is composed of<br> definitely known substances<br> isn't it?<br> Elements are fixed forever<br> in earth unchanging<br> we know that, don't we?<br> All of our scientist<br> based on that<br> All of our science is<br> based on that. Go on<br> In the beginning<br> man used to think that the world<br> have only of four elements,<br> earth, air, fire and water.<br> They thought that everything<br> in their universe<br> could be made out of those.<br> Yes. Go on.<br> But They were wrong, weren't they?<br> They were wrong.<br> Now we know that<br> there are 78 elements<br> The elements over there<br> on the shelves<br> and we believe that there are<br> some elements still unknown<br> but we assume that...<br> these missing elements<br> have the same character<br> as those we know already.<br> That is right<br> Pierre<br> What if there is<br> a kind of matter in the world<br> we never even dream of?<br> What would that mean?<br> Marie, that would mean<br> that our whole conception of the<br> nature of matter would<br> have to be changed.<br> It is cold in here.<br> Tell me what you are thinking.<br> I don't quite dare.<br> Go on and say it now matter<br> how crazy it sounds.<br> What if we did not make a mistake<br> in our measurement?<br> What if the conception<br> of science is wrong?<br> What if there exists a matter<br> that is not in earth<br> but alive, dynamic?<br> Do we dare think that our<br> four missing points<br> these strange power<br> is of 1/1000%?<br> Pierre.<br> We have discovered a new element.<br> An active element.<br> The residue for pitch blende.<br> What was left over<br> After I extract<br> the uranium and the thoarum<br> it must be in there.<br> Where it is?<br> In the resin...<br> Close the curtains.<br> Ready?<br> Marie, if your four missing<br> points are here<br> our notion of the universe<br> will be changed.<br> Ready? Read.<br> Four.<br> Oh, Pierre.<br> Marie. This new concept.<br> If we can prove the existence<br> of this new element<br> it may enable us to look into<br> the secret of life itself<br> deeper than ever before in the<br> history of the world.<br> Madame Curie, you must realize<br> that the board<br> has given you repetition<br> every consideration. However...<br> the university has not an<br> extensive budget<br> for the creation of<br> new laboratories<br> and for the new equipment<br> you ask for.<br> You state that...<br> you and Dr. Curie had detected<br> the presence of a new element<br> an active element.<br> But unfortunately<br> you have given us<br> no convincing proof<br> of its existence.<br> We have demonstrated of<br> its existence experimentally.<br> We have carried on our<br> research intensely<br> except for five weeks<br> in the autumn.<br> In September<br> my daughter was born<br> and a week later<br> my husband has the misfortune to<br> lose his mother.<br> But the rest of the time, we have<br> devoted entirely to research.<br> And yet in this eight<br> or nine months<br> you have came no closer<br> to any proof<br> as to the existence of ah...<br> what is the name of it?<br> Ah, my wife has named it radium.<br> Oh yes, radium<br> I should like to ask<br> Dr. Curie a question.<br> Yes, Professor Roger<br> This work.<br> Will it require<br> quite a little time<br> will it not? Yes, of course.<br> But you are already<br> teaching at school<br> of physics and chemistry.<br> And Madam Curie is teaching at<br> the normal school at Sebra.<br> It would be<br> a formidable undertaking<br> under the best of circumstances.<br> Under these conditions<br> hardly seems promising.<br> And Madam Curie, in spite of<br> her acknowledged abilities is<br> if you would permit me<br> to say so young<br> inexperienced, and a woman.<br> Gentleman. If you please.<br> This remark seems to me<br> entirely irrelevant.<br> It is perfectly true<br> that Madame Curie is young<br> that she has not<br> had the experience<br> that most of us have had<br> and as you say she is a woman.<br> But let me impress upon you<br> gentlemen<br> that she is of most unusual woman<br> I might say her, ah<br> a most unusual woman.<br> You can't classify her<br> with that term<br> I have had the opportunity of<br> observing Madam Curie<br> very closely<br> and I can assure you, gentlemen<br> that she is remarkable scientist<br> as scrupulous as she is brilliant<br> and furthermore...<br> Of course, gentlemen<br> you understand<br> that I am looking upon<br> Madame Curie<br> with complete coolness<br> and complete detachment<br> as I would in judging<br> any other colleague.<br> We understand that<br> you are convinced<br> as to the reliability of<br> Madame curie's investigation.<br> Entirely, I have even put aside<br> my own research<br> to devote my entire time<br> to collaborating with her<br> in the isolation of<br> this new element.<br> Dr. Curie<br> much as we would like to<br> help you and Madame Curie<br> our budget does not provide the<br> purposes of this kind.<br> However, the suggestion was made<br> by Professor Roger<br> in which we have unanimously<br> concurred to offer you the use<br> of the shade across the courtyard<br> from the school of physics.<br> We are aware that this shade<br> is not the most suitable place for<br> your investigation.<br> Gentlemen<br> am I to understand that<br> you are offering us the old shade<br> across from the physics building?<br> The one, that was used as a<br> dissecting room<br> by medical students?<br> If this abominable shade is available,<br> it's only because no one can be<br> found who is willing to work in it.<br> The roof leaks. It has no floor<br> but the wet ground.<br> It can't be heated.<br> In summer, it is stifling<br> as a hot house<br> and in winter, it freezes.<br> And do you imagine that<br> I would permit my wife to work<br> under these appalling conditions?<br> If you do<br> gentlemen, believe me...<br> With my husband's permission<br> we should be very glad<br> to accept the shade.<br> We shall be very grateful<br> to have the shade.<br> This was the shade<br> across the courtyard<br> from the school of physics.<br> This was to be the laboratory<br> of Marie and Pierre Curie<br> The place was even worse than<br> they had expected.<br> There was no equipment.<br> They were at the mercy of<br> the worse extremes of the weather.<br> How could they do anything<br> worthwhile under such conditions?<br> If they'd know at the start<br> how long they will have<br> to work here and<br> what difficulties awaited them<br> would they have dare to begin?<br> Well, yes, they probably would.<br> They were that kind of people.<br> At first<br> it was sheer physical labor<br> beyond the strength<br> of either of them.<br> During those winter days<br> they carried on between them<br> the work of<br> the entire chemical plant.<br> The raw material was pitch blende<br> from the mines of<br> Bohemia tons of it<br> from which they plan to<br> extract all the known elements<br> until only a few ounces remain.<br> From this few ounces, radium<br> their precious element<br> was eventually to be isolated.<br> In the beginning<br> in spite of the bitter cold<br> the work had to be done<br> out of doors<br> because of the fire and fumes.<br> The first step was to<br> melt the crude ore<br> on a large oblong tank<br> till it was boiling like lava.<br> Then acid was poured in.<br> This was to<br> dissolve out the salts.<br> When this was done<br> the next stage was to melt down<br> the residue in separate cordon<br> another back breaking job<br> for the fire must not go out.<br> Night or day<br> either Pierre or Marie<br> had to be on hand all the time.<br> Dogged determination<br> kept them going<br> through month after month of<br> such arduous dangerous work<br> but even so<br> it began at last to tear on<br> both Pierre and Marie.<br> This was something they had to<br> fight continually<br> the gas fumes.<br> Eventually, months run into years<br> The kind of works changed<br> but Pierre had to build<br> or assemble their equipment<br> and with any material<br> that lay at hand.<br> What was left of<br> the original pitch blende<br> had now to be filtered and<br> re-filtered to<br> remove other elements.<br> And this work were not<br> quite so physically strenuous<br> was hard enough<br> specially during<br> the hot summer days.<br> And so the work went on<br> until presently<br> everything had been removed<br> from the tons of ore<br> except two final elements<br> one was barium and the other<br> which they had began to<br> think of it<br> in their heart<br> as their own element<br> was the precious illusive radium.<br> Pierre and Marie thought that<br> the end of their task<br> must surely be in sight.<br> All that was now left was to<br> separate these two survivors<br> barium and radium.<br> This was the problem to<br> separate barium<br> and radium somehow or other.<br> No separation.<br> No separation. No separation.<br> September the 12th 1899.<br> Reduction of pitch blende<br> nearly finish.<br> Only barium and radium remain.<br> The next separation<br> will give radium.<br> November the 8th, 1899.<br> First experiment. No separation.<br> November the 10th, 1899.<br> Second experiment. No separation.<br> July the 16th, 1900.<br> Four hundred<br> and fifty eight experiments.<br> Radium still refuses to separated<br> from barium.<br> Alright, then, radium wouldn't be<br> separated from barium.<br> We've done all we can<br> and more more than<br> most people would have done<br> thanks to your tenacity<br> but it's useless.<br> We'll never find a way<br> of separating.<br> Barium and radium<br> can not be separated.<br> How much longer do you think<br> we can stand this<br> insufferable heat<br> stifling in summer<br> and freezing in winter.<br> How much longer do you think<br> you can drive yourself like this?<br> And how much longer do you think<br> I can stand by<br> and watch you destroy yourself?<br> The world has done without<br> radium up to now.<br> What does it matter<br> if it is isolated<br> for another 100 years.<br> I can't give it up.<br> If it takes a hundred years<br> it would be a pity<br> but I am going to see how far<br> I could go, even my lifetime<br> We have never seen burns<br> quite like this before<br> they are very strange.<br> I can't ever remember<br> seeing anything quite like them<br> they obviously don't come from<br> any normal substance.<br> Madame Curie<br> how long have been making<br> your experiments with<br> this unknown element?<br> For the past three<br> three and a half years.<br> And have these burns<br> given you much pain?<br> No. They are irritating at times<br> but I never pay attention to them<br> until lately.<br> I see.<br> It is obvious that<br> you are dealing with<br> some remarkable powerful force.<br> As to what these burns<br> are exactly<br> there is no means of telling.<br> I don't wish to alarm you<br> Madame Curie<br> but it is possible that<br> these burns might become serious<br> might in fact develop malignantly<br> if you continue to expose them<br> excessively<br> to your unknown element.<br> It is not impossible<br> they may be developed<br> into a cancerous nature.<br> It is my advice, Madame<br> that you abandon your experiments.<br> Cancer.<br> No, Pierre.<br> He only said the burns<br> might develop malignantly<br> Like develop into cancer.<br> No. He said they might possibly<br> develop into a cancerous nature<br> but only if it excessively<br> exposed to our radium.<br> So if we're careful<br> there is nothing<br> to be frightened about.<br> But the very word frightens me.<br> You saw how it took my own mother.<br> We'll have to give up<br> our experiments<br> If we are dealing with<br> as powerful a forces<br> there is no telling what...<br> I wouldn't allow it.<br> I wouldn't let you take such risk<br> I won't permit you.<br> No, Marie. Pierre, please.<br> Listen to me, please.<br> There is something<br> I must tell you<br> and then you should decide<br> as you wish.<br> Very well, Marie.<br> As I left the doctor<br> I have been thinking.<br> This element of ours obviously<br> has a terrific power.<br> Power enough to<br> affect healthy tissue like mine.<br> Power enough to destroy tissue.<br> Pierre, if it has this power<br> why hasn't it also the power to<br> destroy unhealthy tissue?<br> You realize what that might mean?<br> It could heal.<br> By destroying unhealthy tissue<br> it could heal all men of diseases<br> Like cancer? You?<br> Yes, Pierre.<br> It might even do that.<br> We don't know what things<br> it might do for people.<br> But, Marie... Oh, Pierre.<br> Can't you see<br> how unimportant little things<br> like these are compared<br> to what it might mean?<br> It might prevent great sicknesses<br> even deaths. Pierre.<br> And so they went on<br> with their work<br> using every possible precaution.<br> Marie's fingers healed.<br> And though<br> they did not find a way<br> to separate radium and barium<br> in a single process<br> they did discover a method of<br> removing barium<br> little by little in<br> infinite decimal amounts.<br> Working on the theory<br> that once the whole of the barium<br> is removed<br> nothing could be left but radium.<br> Here we see the sort of<br> things they had to do.<br> This is called crystallization.<br> When the liquid evaporates<br> crystals are left.<br> This was the thing they had to<br> do over and over again.<br> It proved to be the most exacting<br> of all of the stages<br> of their long test.<br> For it continues for two years<br> and require thousands of<br> separate operations.<br> By now the residue<br> from all the various processes<br> they had worked at lay<br> in hundreds of<br> this small evaporating bowls.<br> Small, because larger quantities<br> would not evaporate so quickly.<br> Crystallizing<br> and re-crystallizing.<br> Each operation<br> they hope bring them<br> closer and closer to the heart of<br> the great mystery.<br> At last, they arrive<br> at the final crystallization<br> the one that contains the concentrated<br> results of all the others.<br> The last survivors out of<br> those hundreds of evaporating bowls.<br> I think I feel like crying<br> Professor Poirot.<br> Professor Poirot.<br> Madam Curie, but I am afraid<br> I have come at a crucial moment.<br> No. No. We have finished.<br> We have nothing to do now<br> but wait.<br> I am delighted to see you.<br> There is nobody<br> we'd rather have waited<br> at this moment than you.<br> Thank you.<br> And I have brought with me<br> an very illustrious visitor.<br> No more illustrious than these<br> young folks will be.<br> The name of Curie will lead<br> all the rest.<br> Your taller, my boy, considerably<br> than I have imagine.<br> And you, Madame, so young,<br> so beautiful and so brilliant<br> I don't know which is<br> the greater miracle<br> you or radium.<br> Why don't you introduce me<br> Poirot?<br> I think I know.<br> Isn't it Lord Kelvin?<br> I absolutely refuse to<br> return to London<br> without meeting you both.<br> As long as<br> the greatest living scientist<br> believe in<br> the existence of radium<br> what the other thoughts<br> didn't seem to matter.<br> Here are the evaporating dishes.<br> How many crystallization<br> did you make<br> hundreds I suppose?<br> Tell him, Pierre.<br> Look here, sir.<br> Five thousands six hundred<br> and seventy-seven.<br> And the last crystallization is<br> in there, I supposed.<br> Five thousands six hundred<br> and seventy-seven.<br> And thus crystallization.<br> What a historic moment.<br> That little bowl<br> represents eight tons<br> of pitch blende<br> and four years of work.<br> In a few hour<br> the water will be gone<br> and only radium will remain.<br> Pure radium.<br> I am sort of tempted to<br> stay and see it<br> but it's New Year's Eve and<br> my family is expected me<br> in London.<br> Mine is just as well.<br> This great moment should<br> belong to the two of you alone.<br> You begin the year, my friends<br> that will mark your fame.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, Sir.<br> C'mon along, Poirot.<br> My train won't wait.<br> Goodnight, dear,<br> Goodbye.<br> I shall come back to Paris<br> next week<br> and see your radium<br> with my own eye.<br> You can send me<br> a telegram tonight<br> and describing it to me.<br> We have a coin over there.<br> We wrote something<br> out for this occasion<br> Bring out the old<br> bring in the new<br> bring out the false<br> bring in the true.<br> Good bye. God blessed you.<br> Good bye. Good bye.<br> What a wonderful man.<br> The really great men<br> are always simple and good.<br> Yes.<br> We're both very tired.<br> Yes.<br> Shall we try to get some rest?<br> Very well<br> Sit here a while and<br> I cover you with this robe.<br> There.<br> Put that chair over.<br> I can't reach you<br> Yeah. That's better.<br> Let's try to doze off.<br> Pierre.<br> What time is it? I overslept.<br> I must be tired.<br> It is five.<br> Must be crystallized by now.<br> Must be there.<br> Our radium must be there.<br> C'mon.<br> Do you mind? You look first.<br> There's nothing there<br> not a trace of anything<br> not a grain.<br> Only a stain.<br> What had happened Pierre?<br> Where is our radium?<br> What have we done?<br> Where is it? What's happened?<br> Where is it, Pierre?<br> I don't know.<br> What did we do that was wrong?<br> What could we have done?<br> We've done nothing wrong.<br> I can't stand it, Pierre<br> Where is our radium?<br> We worked for<br> years and years and years<br> It must be there.<br> It must be there.<br> Four long years in this shed.<br> Four long years.<br> Is that you?<br> Yes, Father.<br> Well, something's got to be don<br> about that child of yours.<br> I think you ought to take it back.<br> I let her stand on my head<br> to let her eat her supper<br> and now she...<br> now she, now she won't go to bed<br> until her mother tells her story.<br> I like to know what's the matter<br> with my stories.<br> They are the same stories.<br> I'll go up to her.<br> Then what happened, Mommy.<br> I am sorry, Irene darling.<br> Mother just can't tell you<br> anymore tonight.<br> Oh, Mommy, please.<br> What is the matter, Mommy?<br> But, I wanted to know<br> what happen, Mommy<br> If you close your eyes tight<br> Daddy will tell you a story.<br> What's it about?<br> Well, ah, its about<br> ah, it's about a strange<br> and wonderful treasure<br> that was locked up<br> in an enchanted stone.<br> Is there a princess in it?<br> Yes, a princess.<br> A beautiful princes<br> with golden hair.<br> Is there a prince too?<br> No, not a prince<br> but a man who live all alone<br> until the princess found him.<br> Did they love each other?<br> Very much.<br> Alright, Daddy<br> my eyes are closed<br> Well, now, one day the princes<br> told the man<br> about this wonderful treasure<br> so they decided to go<br> and search of it together.<br> Now, no one had ever seen<br> this treasure<br> of course, but the princes knew<br> that it was there.<br> And she knew if they could get it<br> out of the stone,<br> it might let people see<br> wonderful things<br> that they had never<br> been able to see before.<br> So they worked very hard<br> for a long long time<br> to try and rescue the treasure<br> from the stone.<br> And they grew very tired<br> And at last, they knew that...<br> they would never be able to<br> free the treasure<br> from the enchant of the stone<br> but they weren't sad about it<br> because they knew that<br> no matter how many disappointment<br> they had<br> they would always go on together.<br> Having the courage<br> to take many disappointments<br> because they were together<br> and they live happily ever after.<br> She is asleep.<br> You know, we promised David that...<br> But I supposed you naturally<br> don't feel like...<br> Oh, I remember.<br> The New Year's Party.<br> But, of course<br> you don't feel like going.<br> Pierre, we promised.<br> Let's go.<br> I'd rather. Might help.<br> Good. Good then.<br> Happy New Year. Happy New Year.<br> Happy New Year.<br> Happy New Year, Marie.<br> Happy New Year, Pierre.<br> Try to put it out of your mind<br> Marie<br> and go to sleep<br> I can't.<br> I can't accept it, Pierre.<br> But, Marie, sometimes<br> there are things<br> you just must accept it<br> If I only knew why we fail.<br> I think that the failure itself<br> I wouldn't mind<br> so much about it<br> but the reason for it.<br> Months and months and months ago<br> you did find<br> the right process to use.<br> At the very end<br> why should it suddenly fail?<br> I don't know. I don't know.<br> Pierre, that stain on the saucer.<br> Yes.<br> We didn't even test it, did we?<br> No, we didn't.<br> What we are expecting to find<br> was a definite amount of radium<br> wasn't it?<br> Something we could see and feel.<br> Not as much as a pinch of salt<br> you said<br> Yes.<br> Pierre, what if it's...<br> a merely a question of amount?<br> What does so little radium<br> in proportion<br> to the amount of material<br> that we use<br> that we now we couldn't see it.<br> What if that stain?<br> Even with the merest<br> merest breath...<br> Go on.<br> Pierre, could it... be that<br> that stain is radium?<br> Pierre. It's there. Our radium.<br> It's there. It's there.<br> Pierre.<br> Pierre. It's there. It's there.<br> It's there.<br> Oh, Pierre.<br> Where are they?<br> Are they in Paris or go<br> wherever they are.<br> I am not going to tell you<br> where they are.<br> But, Dr. Curie<br> I am the representative<br> of the London Times<br> and there are<br> representatives here<br> from the presses of all the great<br> nations in the world.<br> Don't Dr.<br> and Madame Curie realize<br> they can't hide from the press?<br> The whole world is on fire<br> from their discovery.<br> The publics want to know<br> about them.<br> We have heard that<br> they had refused<br> to take in money for their radium<br> that they are giving it<br> to the world.<br> The Nobel Prize to a woman.<br> These are important matters<br> Dr. curie<br> and the world must be told<br> about them.<br> Yes, the public must know.<br> Did they give it for free?<br> Where are they now?<br> Gentlemen<br> all that I know is Pierre<br> and Marie are very tired.<br> They have been interviewed<br> so much that<br> I can't see there is any more to<br> tell that<br> the public would be interested in.<br> They're sick.<br> They've gone away<br> on a holiday to rest.<br> Now, it's utterly impossible<br> for any newspaperman<br> in the world to try to interview<br> Dr. or Madame Curie<br> at the present time<br> I'm sorry.<br> Excuse me.<br> I am from The Courier<br> the newspaper in Grandovland.<br> Do you think<br> I could see Madame Curie?<br> I'm afraid you can't see her.<br> They've come here to rest.<br> It's their first holiday<br> in five years.<br> You wouldn't want to disturb them.<br> Perhaps you could<br> tell me something about her.<br> I can't go back without<br> some sort of story.<br> Would you like to have something<br> for your paper<br> that very people know yet?<br> Oh, I certainly would.<br> Well. Put in your newspaper that<br> the University has granted Dr.<br> and Mme. Curie<br> a splendid new laboratory with<br> many rooms<br> the latest equipment<br> many assistants.<br> It will be presented to them in<br> a formal ceremony next week.<br> Next week?<br> There. Fair enough.<br> That's fine, Madame.<br> That's wonderful.<br> I don't know how to thank you.<br> I can tell you<br> I was scared of meeting Mme. Curie<br> but it was rather important to me.<br> You see<br> this is my first assignment<br> if I could have<br> gotten the interview<br> it would help a lot.<br> Well, monsieur.<br> You can tell your newspaper that<br> you got your interview<br> with Mme. Curie.<br> Madame. Good bye.<br> Are you... are you Mme. Curie?<br> Yes. And this is my daughter<br> Irene.<br> It's a new bicycle so she has to<br> show it off.<br> And now... Mommy...<br> Oh, yes. My baby. This is E.<br> She's been a good baby?<br> Very good, Madame.<br> Been very good, darling?<br> Yes. Wei, Madame.<br> Did she drink her milk?<br> Yes.<br> Alright... Wei, Madame.<br> Well, keep her out<br> in the airy deck.<br> Alright. Off you go.<br> Now she made a grand tour<br> of the garden<br> And now<br> you'll excuse me. Good bye.<br> Good bye.<br> Know what I'm doing? Pierre.<br> I thought you were asleep.<br> No. I'm walking through<br> the new laboratory.<br> Don't imagine it too grand.<br> It might not come up<br> to your expectations.<br> And at the moment, I'm walking down<br> the long white hall.<br> And I'm with you?<br> Yes, you are with me.<br> Now<br> I'm examining your work table.<br> I don't believe it's large enough.<br> How's yours?<br> Oh, yes. I haven't got there yet.<br> It will be exciting, won't it?<br> When we walk in the first time.<br> Yes. It will be wonderful to<br> get back to work again.<br> We lost so much time.<br> Oh, Pierre.<br> The time we spent here<br> hasn't been lost<br> We got our strength back.<br> Yes, that's true.<br> We were ill, both of us<br> more than we knew.<br> You know, when we first came here<br> I used to<br> have fantastically morbid<br> thoughts sometimes.<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, everyday that passed seem<br> so completely lost.<br> I have a feeling that<br> I didn't have much time to lose,<br> that my days were... well, it...<br> that I mustn't waste them<br> that I have to drive ahead quickly<br> in order to have time<br> to finish everything<br> I wanted to finish<br> It's odd how one's mind would...<br> Why, Marie.<br> What a horrible thought to have.<br> It's just because I was so ill.<br> How could such a thought<br> entered your mind.<br> Oh, darling.<br> Don't take it so seriously<br> It frightens me.<br> I'm sorry I mentioned it.<br> It was nothing.<br> It's because I was so worn out.<br> You know, Marie, how tired I was.<br> Pierre. If one of us<br> should ever go<br> the other couldn't go on alone.<br> Couldn't be expected of us<br> could it?<br> Oh, Marie. I've upset you.<br> Could it, Pierre?<br> You were wrong, Marie.<br> Whatever happens<br> if one should go<br> the other must stay on.<br> One must work just the same.<br> But I for one had no intention of<br> going anywhere<br> except to our<br> wonderful new laboratory.<br> Only one more week.<br> Just think of it.<br> After all this waiting<br> only one more week.<br> Pierre?<br> Yes, dear.<br> Come back here.<br> Ha?<br> Come back.<br> What is it?<br> I want to tell you something.<br> Sit down.<br> Well? What is it?<br> So hard.<br> I just can't find the words.<br> Pierre, are you proud of me?<br> Marie.<br> Because I'm so proud of you.<br> I'm so proud that sometimes<br> I think I'll burst.<br> You're a very great man, Pierre.<br> Not the way the world means.<br> Just you.<br> Your kindness, your gentleness<br> and your wisdom.<br> I love you, Pierre, so deeply.<br> I never dreamed...<br> I'm so thankful, Pierre.<br> That's what I wanted to tell you.<br> That's what I thought<br> you'll always know.<br> France sees it fit to bestow<br> the famous scientific couple<br> a truly great honor<br> in reward for their services<br> to science and to mankind.<br> Well, are you truly impressed?<br> The president and faulty of<br> the University of Paris<br> will present Pierre and<br> Mme. Curie with a fully<br> equipped laboratory<br> with which to carry on<br> their many experiments<br> they have opened the gateway to.<br> At 6:30 on 19th, April<br> that's today, you know.<br> There will be<br> a formal presentation<br> of the laboratory at which<br> the world famous couple<br> will appear.<br> Not bad, eh? Not bad.<br> Good morning. Good morning.<br> Good morning, Father.<br> Good morning<br> Good morning, children.<br> What's the matter<br> with this place today?<br> After all<br> it was no different than<br> any other day, isn't it?<br> This house is in a turmoil.<br> Everything is upside down<br> topsy turvy<br> nothing in its place.<br> Where is your mother?<br> I haven't seen her for hours.<br> I don't know how I'm going to<br> remember everything.<br> And, ah...<br> Where's my coffee? I'm late.<br> Oh. Thank you, Lucille.<br> Don't know<br> where your mother has gone.<br> The house without a woman<br> I don't understand.<br> Marie?<br> Mother's in there.<br> What's she doing in there?<br> Mother's in there.<br> Mother's in there.<br> Marie.<br> I wouldn't go in there, Pierre<br> if I were you.<br> She's having the last fitting<br> on her new dress<br> she's going to wear tonight<br> for the presentation.<br> It's supposed to be a surprise.<br> Oh, good. Good.<br> That's a very sound idea.<br> Yeah. Remember<br> I didn't tell you.<br> No.<br> Pardon me, is Dr. Pierre here?<br> That's him.<br> Oh. Mme. Curie would like to<br> see you.<br> You like it, Pierre?<br> It's for this evening<br> for the ceremony<br> You look very beautiful, Marie.<br> You really like it?<br> I do. Very much.<br> What color is that?<br> It's, ah, very deep red.<br> You want to have some kind of<br> a little ornament, haven't you?<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> Yes. Yes, you should.<br> Something... something bright.<br> I've seen them on women.<br> They look nice<br> Now you're making me<br> self-conscious.<br> Oh, I was thinking what a pity<br> evening dress becomes you so.<br> But there you are<br> we just haven't<br> had the time, have we?<br> Oh, look at that.<br> Our beautiful day ruined.<br> Oh, I was going to spend the day<br> in the park with the children.<br> Well, I must be off.<br> I have a hundred things<br> to do today.<br> I promise to go to the institute<br> I have to look at<br> the proofs of my paper<br> from my publisher<br> and endless thing.<br> I want to clean everything up and<br> start fresh from the laboratory<br> in the morning.<br> You mustn't be late.<br> You must allowed yourself<br> time to dress<br> Madame. Madame, the pins.<br> Oh. Oh.<br> Perhaps one day<br> I'll get a new dress suit.<br> You know I have had mine<br> since I got my Doctors degree.<br> Looks bad on me, isn't it?<br> No, Pierre.<br> You look very handsome in anything<br> Thank you, Marie.<br> Good bye. Good bye, darling.<br> They're always<br> calling for us at six.<br> I'll be here.<br> Don't forget your rubbers. No.<br> Or your umbrella.<br> Good bye.<br> Good bye, Pierre. Pierre...<br> Is there something I can show you<br> Monsieur?<br> I would like to buy a pair of<br> earrings for a lady.<br> We're going to a party tonight.<br> Yes, Monsieur.<br> Did you have anything special<br> in mind?<br> Well, I've seen women<br> wearing earrings<br> that I thought were very pretty.<br> Of course, I would like to<br> get something<br> that would match the lady's gown.<br> May I ask the color of the gown<br> monsieur?<br> It's dark red.<br> It's rather a special gown.<br> Not blow, of course, but...<br> What do you think of these<br> Monsieur.<br> They're amethysts<br> They're very lovely.<br> Oh, yes, aren't they.<br> And what are these?<br> Those are garnets.<br> Really? They're both lovely.<br> I hardly know...<br> It would depend on the shape of<br> the lady's face.<br> Is it oval or round?<br> I would say that<br> her face was oval.<br> Yes, oval.<br> And is she blond or...<br> Blond, definitely.<br> But not too blond.<br> I mean, she can't... well<br> just blond.<br> And her hair is sort of gold<br> you know<br> Gold?<br> Yes. And her eyes are gray.<br> Very calm gray.<br> The coloring is very lovely.<br> Sort of smooth skin<br> and nice delicate, coloring<br> and well I...<br> I don't know if it will be<br> of any help to you<br> but the lady is quite beautiful.<br> Lovely. You look very beautiful<br> my dear.<br> Thank you.<br> It's rather unusual to be praised<br> for the way I look.<br> I'm sure you could have<br> had that praise<br> from men if you'd had wished it.<br> Thank you, Father.<br> I don't understand<br> Pierre being late today of all days.<br> Well, you know, Pierre.<br> I brought in some wine.<br> I thought we might all drink<br> to that new laboratory<br> before you go.<br> Oh, that was thoughtful of you<br> Father.<br> That must be Professor Poirot<br> and Pierre's not here.<br> Let me.<br> Pierre?<br> Mme. Curie, it is my painful<br> due to inform you that...<br> your husband has been<br> the victim of a street accident.<br> He was instantly killed.<br> It came at such no pain.<br> Has she any better?<br> Just the same.<br> I can't get her to speak to me.<br> I'm frightened.<br> Is she in there?<br> Yes.<br> Forgive me, if I intrude.<br> I do so as Pierre's old friend<br> as your old friend and teacher.<br> Please try to<br> attend to what I say.<br> Try to hear my words.<br> Think what Pierre<br> what he should do.<br> How he would want you to live now.<br> It is my believed that<br> he would wish you<br> to continue his and yours.<br> My friend...<br> I know how much<br> the laboratory meant to Pierre.<br> I know how much hurt<br> if it wasn't to be yours.<br> It was his dream that someday<br> you and he<br> would stand there together.<br> I know it is very hard for you<br> to think of going on by yourself<br> when you have done<br> everything together so many years.<br> One must go on working<br> just the same.<br> You must find somewhere<br> within yourself<br> the strength to carry on<br> Pierre's work and you own. Ha?<br> Ten years ago<br> you told me so often that<br> you were impressed<br> by something I said<br> when you were a student<br> in my class.<br> I spoke of Newton and Galileo<br> and I said that probably none of<br> you would ever reach so high<br> to get the star<br> in your fingertips.<br> I was wrong.<br> I have, too, seen you reaching to<br> the high place of knowledge<br> and get your star<br> under your fingertips.<br> Marie, there are more stars.<br> The Faculty of Science<br> of University of Paris invites you<br> to attend the ceremony honored by<br> the presence of Mme. Curie<br> to commemorate<br> the twenty-fifth anniversary<br> of the discovery of radium.<br> Yes, she was famous now.<br> This frail, stubborn, eager woman<br> had carried on her great work<br> for a quarter of a century.<br> Mme. Curie.<br> Even now, after twenty-five years<br> of intensive research,<br> we feel there is a great deal<br> still to be done.<br> We have made discoveries.<br> Pierre Curie, in the suggestions<br> we found in his notes<br> and in thoughts<br> he expressed to me<br> has helped to guide us to him.<br> But no one of us can do much<br> if each of us perhaps<br> can catch some glimpse knowledge<br> which modestly<br> insufficient itself<br> may add to man's dream of truth.<br> It is by these small candles<br> in our darkness that<br> we see before us little by little<br> the dim outlines of<br> that great plan<br> that shapes the universe.<br> And I am among those who think<br> that for this reason,<br> science has great beauty and with<br> its great spiritual strength<br> will in time cleanse this world<br> of its evils<br> it's ignorance, poverty, diseases<br> wars and heartaches<br> Look for the clear light of truth<br> Look for unknown new roads<br> even when men's sight is<br> keener far from now.<br> Divine wonder will never fail us.<br> Every age has its own dream.<br> Leave then the dreams<br> of yesterday<br> You take the torch of knowledge<br> and build the palace<br> of the future.<br>
