Best I can turn up<br> is an empty picture frame.<br> Something was<br> burned in this basket.<br> Looks like a passport folder.<br> Blood pressure, low.<br> No reaction to pain.<br> Doesn't respond<br> to oral command.<br> Give her 10 milligrams<br> of Nalline.<br> If she doesn't<br> come around in 15 minutes,<br> we'll try another five.<br> Well?<br> I think I'll send her over<br> to Psycho for observation.<br> No. I killed him.<br> I'll sign a confession.<br> I want to sign a confession.<br> Dr. Evans, will you witness<br> this signature, please?<br> Good morning.<br> I've been appointed<br> by the court to defend you.<br> I can understand<br> that you'd like someone<br> older, more experienced.<br> It isn't over.<br> There has to be a trial<br> in the interests of justice.<br> I'm here to help you.<br> No one's heard<br> your side of it, yet.<br> Your life is at stake.<br> Please, let me<br> do something for you.<br> Please, tell me<br> how it happened.<br> Please, let me help you.<br> I guess<br> that'll be all for today.<br> You know, you might<br> as well have stayed in<br> New York this weekend<br> for all the company<br> you've been.<br> I've never been<br> so conscious of my<br> monumental lack of knowledge.<br> Criminal law. Whatever<br> possessed an Anderson<br> to take up criminal law?<br> Probably his 50% Parker,<br> Grandma.<br> Probably.<br> You two<br> night owls still at it?<br> How did the meeting go, Dad?<br> Very promising. Joe thinks<br> we have enough pledges<br> to swing the nomination.<br> That's great!<br> I knew I would dance<br> at my son's inauguration ball.<br> Now, now,<br> it's all just straws in the<br> wind until the convention.<br> Many come but two are chosen.<br> Don't be negative.<br> I'm ordering my<br> inaugural gown in the morning.<br> Well, did you meet<br> the mysterious Madame X?<br> Yeah. Dad,<br> she breaks your heart.<br> She's just<br> completely withdrawn,<br> waiting to die.<br> She doesn't even<br> want a defense.<br> Clay, I realize how<br> important your first case is,<br> but no one expects<br> you to win it, you know?<br> Maybe not,<br> but I've got to try.<br> You're the best lawyer I know.<br> What would you do?<br> How would you defend her?<br> Well, I'm only<br> a corporation lawyer, but it<br> seems to me that I remember<br> an old professor<br> of mine at Harvard.<br> He used to say that<br> a best defense<br> is a good offense.<br> Now, Sullivan's got a record<br> a mile long, hasn't he?<br> He sure has, grand larceny,<br> procuring, blackmail...<br> Try him on that record.<br> "Ladies and gentlemen<br> of the jury, this poor<br> woman did not sin.<br> "She was sinned against."<br> Try Dan Sullivan<br> for his own murder?<br> Exactly.<br> Exactly.<br> The prosecution<br> on behalf of The People<br> of the State of New York<br> charges the defendant with<br> murder in the first degree,<br> and asks that the<br> penalty be fixed at death.<br> How does the defense plead?<br> The defense pleads<br> not guilty, Your Honor.<br> (CROWD CHATTERING)<br> (GAVEL POUNDING)<br> The defense will show that the<br> defendant was not responsible<br> at the time of the crime,<br> and that the<br> so-called confession was<br> obtained under duress.<br> Prosecution may<br> present its case.<br> Is this the gun?<br> It is.<br> Had the gun been discharged?<br> Yes. Three bullets<br> had been fired.<br> No further questions.<br> JUDGE: Cross-examine.<br> Did you speak to the defendant<br> when you found her?<br> Yes, I asked her name.<br> What was her answer?<br> She didn't answer.<br> Now, according to the<br> report you filed,<br> you addressed<br> several questions to her.<br> Did she answer any of them?<br> No.<br> Did she look at you<br> when you spoke to her?<br> No, she just sat there<br> and stared out.<br> In other words,<br> the defendant appeared<br> to be in a state of shock.<br> Objection, defense counsel<br> is asking the witness<br> for a medical opinion.<br> Well, Your Honor, I think<br> we can presume that a police<br> officer is experienced enough<br> to recognize a state of shock.<br> Objection overruled.<br> Did the defendant<br> appear to be<br> in a state of shock?<br> Yes, she did.<br> Now, will you tell the court<br> the defendant's words<br> when you entered the room?<br> She said, "Get the police.<br> I've killed a man."<br> Did you see the gun?<br> Yes, she was holding it.<br> Mr. Lopez,<br> did you see the defendant<br> kill Dan Sullivan?<br> Point the gun,<br> pull the trigger?<br> No, he was already dead.<br> Thank you.<br> No further questions.<br> Will you read the court<br> the criminal record<br> of Daniel M. Sullivan?<br> Objection. The record<br> of the deceased is irrelevant<br> and immaterial to this case.<br> Your Honor, the defense<br> respectfully contends<br> that the character<br> of the deceased had a<br> direct bearing on his death.<br> I'm going to allow<br> the witness the answer.<br> In 1954,<br> Sullivan served three months<br> for petty larceny.<br> In 1955, he was convicted<br> of extortion on charges<br> of a Mrs. Arthur Golden,<br> paid a $1,000 fine.<br> In 1957, Sullivan was<br> convicted of procuring and<br> served a year in state prison.<br> In 1960, three years<br> for violation of the<br> Federal Narcotics Law.<br> In 1963, a bench warrant<br> was issued for his arrest<br> on another extortion charge<br> by a Miss Frances Elliott,<br> age 63.<br> But he got across<br> the border to Mexico before<br> he could be apprehended.<br> Were there any<br> other blackmail charges<br> brought against Sullivan?<br> Yes, four times<br> extortion charges were<br> brought, and dropped,<br> when the claimants<br> refused to sign.<br> Your Honor, I must<br> protest. If the charges<br> weren't substantiated,<br> surely they're not<br> admissible as evidence.<br> Your Honor,<br> victims of blackmail<br> are rarely willing<br> to sign complaints.<br> Objection sustained,<br> the answer is stricken.<br> The jury is instructed<br> not to consider the<br> last question and answer<br> in their deliberations.<br> Sergeant Riley,<br> based solely on convictions,<br> Daniel M. Sullivan's crimes<br> were mainly directed<br> against women, weren't they?<br> Yes.<br> No further questions.<br> Doctor, would you describe<br> absinthe to the court?<br> Absinthe is a green,<br> toxic liqueur,<br> between 70 and 80 proof,<br> distilled from<br> wormwood and aromatics.<br> Is absinthe procurable<br> in this country?<br> Not legally.<br> Well, is absinthe<br> legally procurable<br> anyplace in the world?<br> Not to my knowledge.<br> Why not?<br> Well, absinthe<br> produces a degenerative<br> effect upon the system.<br> It attacks the digestive<br> organs and nerve centers.<br> It can induce<br> delirium and has been<br> known to destroy sanity.<br> Doctor, is the defendant<br> addicted to absinthe?<br> She is.<br> No further questions.<br> Cross-examine.<br> Dr. Evans,<br> did you examine the defendant<br> when she was arrested?<br> Yes.<br> Did you request a<br> psychiatric examination?<br> I considered it.<br> Did you request it?<br> No.<br> Then we must assume<br> that you considered<br> the defendant legally sane.<br> No further questions.<br> Dr. Evans, what does the term<br> "legally sane" mean?<br> Well, that the<br> defendant understands<br> the nature of his act<br> and its probable consequences.<br> Well, would it be possible for<br> an individual to be legally<br> sane, but medically insane?<br> Tragically so.<br> Now, when you<br> allowed the defendant<br> to face trial,<br> did you consider<br> her medically sane?<br> Objection. The medical<br> sanity of the defendant<br> has no bearing on this case.<br> (GAVEL POUNDING)<br> The Penal Code of the State<br> of New York plainly states...<br> JUDGE: Address your remarks<br> to the bench.<br> But Your Honor,<br> the medical sanity<br> of the defendant<br> is not the consideration<br> of this court.<br> Overruled, Mr. Spalding.<br> Did you consider the<br> defendant medically sane?<br> No.<br> Thank you.<br> No further questions.<br> Are you a doctor<br> of psychiatry?<br> No.<br> Would you feel yourself<br> qualified to pass on<br> the sanity of the accused?<br> Objection.<br> The prosecution is attempting<br> to impeach its own witness.<br> You can't play both<br> sides of the street...<br> JUDGE: Order, order...<br> (BOTH ARGUING)<br> (GAVEL POUNDING)<br> Stop it! Stop it.<br> I can't bear anymore.<br> How long must I wait?<br> (CRYING)<br> JUDGE: Order, or I will have<br> the court cleared.<br> How long must I wait?<br> Counselor, please<br> ask your client to<br> try to compose herself.<br> Take my life!<br> The sooner the better,<br> but take it.<br> Court will recess until 2:00.<br> How is she?<br> Well, I've given her<br> an injection, but it's like<br> trying to hold onto a wraith.<br> May I talk with her?<br> Only for a moment.<br> She's worn out in spirit<br> as well as body.<br> She can't endure much more.<br> There's only<br> a little time left.<br> We still have a chance,<br> but you've got to<br> tell me what happened.<br> You've got to give me<br> something to fight with.<br> Help me before it's too late.<br> Please, help me.<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> would you mind using<br> the main entrance?<br> Now, you've seen<br> the murder weapon,<br> and you've heard the<br> defendant's admission of guilt<br> to the hotel employee,<br> Manuel Lopez,<br> and to Detective Combs,<br> and you've seen the confession<br> signed by the defendant, "X."<br> I solemnly charge you,<br> do not be tricked<br> into sympathy for her.<br> She is a murderess.<br> She has broken<br> the law of God and man.<br> She must pay for her crime.<br> Now, the defense attorney<br> would persuade you<br> to convict Dan Sullivan<br> of his own murder.<br> He'd have you<br> believe that the deed of<br> Madame X was justified<br> because Dan Sullivan<br> was a disreputable man.<br> Disreputable or not,<br> I would wish for Dan Sullivan<br> what can never be his.<br> A fair and honest trial<br> before a jury of his peers.<br> Madame "X" appointed herself<br> his judge and his executioner.<br> Now, the defense attorney<br> comes before us on his<br> first case, young and eager,<br> son of a brilliant<br> and famous father.<br> And I'm sure<br> Governor Anderson is proud<br> of the resourceful fight<br> that Clayton Anderson Junior<br> has waged in this court room.<br> However, admiration<br> for the young man<br> or sympathy for his client<br> must not sway you.<br> I charge you to uphold the law<br> and to punish its violators.<br> Madame "X" is a murderess.<br> She's taken a life.<br> And on behalf of the people,<br> I must demand<br> her life in return.<br> (GAVEL POUNDING)<br> Mr. Anderson, are you<br> ready to make your<br> concluding statement?<br> Wait. There's something<br> I want to say.<br> You're out of order.<br> If you wish to make<br> a statement, you must be<br> sworn in, and take the stand.<br> Yes.<br> No, Madame, no. Your Honor,<br> may I have a recess<br> to talk with my client?<br> Itll be all right.<br> Don't worry.<br> No, you're not prepared<br> as a witness.<br> I know exactly<br> what I want to say.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Place your left hand<br> on the Bible.<br> Do you solemnly swear that<br> the testimony you are about<br> to give before this court<br> is the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth,<br> so help you God?<br> I do.<br> Please be seated.<br> Madam, do you want<br> to tell us what happened?<br> Madam.<br> You're a child, fighting alone<br> in a terrible darkness.<br> I would have left this earth<br> without explanation,<br> but you, you alone,<br> have made it impossible.<br> Over and over<br> he begged me to tell what<br> happened, and I never did.<br> I let him stand up here<br> in front of you without<br> a weapon in his hand.<br> Life had long ceased<br> to have meaning for me.<br> And I didn't think or care<br> what I was doing to him.<br> Forgive me. Forgive me.<br> I'm not dead, after all.<br> The dead don't weep<br> or feel such pain.<br> Child, don't fight any longer.<br> I killed Dan Sullivan.<br> He fished me<br> out of the sewers of Mexico.<br> He bought me dirt cheap.<br> A couple of aspirin,<br> a few bottles of whiskey,<br> and I killed him.<br> Why did you kill him?<br> He found out I once had a son,<br> a family, respectable family,<br> and a fine son.<br> They thought I was dead<br> more than 20 years,<br> and Sullivan was going to<br> tell my child that I was alive<br> and what I'd become.<br> I don't have much<br> to leave my son.<br> Only a lie that his mother<br> was clean and good.<br> Why did you leave your family?<br> I wasn't suitable.<br> I really wasn't.<br> I wonder why it took me<br> so long to see it?<br> I killed Dan Sullivan<br> to keep my son<br> from knowing about me.<br> I'm not sorry.<br> And if time were turned back,<br> I'd kill him again.<br> That's the truth, child.<br> The truth.<br> These are the most<br> important words I may<br> ever have to say,<br> and this is the most<br> important decision you<br> may ever have to make.<br> I stand between<br> a woman and death,<br> and you stand here with me.<br> There was a speech<br> I was going to make,<br> but I can't make it now.<br> Not after those simple,<br> heartbreaking words of hers.<br> Mr. Spalding has cautioned<br> you not to try Dan Sullivan<br> for his own murder.<br> Well, how can you<br> do otherwise?<br> He'd be alive if it weren't<br> for his own evil greed.<br> His sins finally<br> caught up with him,<br> and he reaped the whirlwind.<br> The prosecution<br> accuses my client<br> of breaking the law of God,<br> or did, before he<br> heard her story. Perhaps he<br> wouldn't charge that now.<br> For does the lioness<br> lose favor with God when<br> she fights for her cubs?<br> Does the mother bear,<br> who kills at the<br> mouth of the cave?<br> In all creation is there<br> the female of the species<br> who will not sacrifice<br> her own life to protect<br> the life she has conceived?<br> Dark and terrible years<br> lie between this woman<br> and her son,<br> but she protects him,<br> even now, with her life.<br> Her son will never know<br> how deeply he is loved.<br> She thinks he would be<br> ashamed of her.<br> I think he would kneel<br> and hold her to his heart.<br> The prosecution<br> asks for justice.<br> I would remind him<br> and you of the towering<br> words of Sophocles.<br> "There is a point at which<br> even justice is unjust."<br> Justice must be fair.<br> It must be merciful.<br> It must be understanding.<br> My client doesn't ask for her<br> life. She's ready to die,<br> knowing her son to be safe.<br> I ask it.<br> I give this woman's life<br> into your hands.<br> And I beg you<br> to return it to her.<br> JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen,<br> you have heard the evidence.<br> You will retire<br> to deliberate your verdict.<br> (GASPS)<br> Matron.<br> I must see her.<br> I can't tell you<br> how important it is.<br> I'll see what I can do,<br> Governor.<br> I'm beyond reason.<br> Holly drowned.<br> How can she still be alive?<br> May we be alone?<br> We'll wait outside.<br> You must be very quiet.<br> I know.<br> We're going to win.<br> Don't worry.<br> Did you do well in school?<br> Middling well.<br> Middling well.<br> I haven't heard<br> that expression<br> since my father died.<br> Where do you live?<br> In New York.<br> Alone?<br> (LAUGHS)<br> In a one-room apartment.<br> Let your son know<br> that you're alive.<br> Give him a chance to love you.<br> Do you have a girl?<br> Yes.<br> We're going to be<br> married soon.<br> You love her very much?<br> Very much.<br> The moments of love are<br> the only ones that matter.<br> The moments of love<br> illuminate and are gone.<br> Treasure them.<br> And when you're married,<br> live alone.<br> It's so important<br> to live alone.<br> And when you have a child,<br> get a little house.<br> A red-frame house<br> on a friendly street<br> with good neighbors<br> and lots of children.<br> Did you have a house<br> like that?<br> Almost.<br> I was once almost<br> a rich, rich woman.<br> Please let me call your son.<br> No.<br> But if I were your son,<br> I'd want to know.<br> Don't make decisions for him.<br> It's the only prerogative<br> of motherhood I still possess.<br> He's free of my sins.<br> Your son should be here.<br> You're here.<br> Yes.<br> Today, I've had a son.<br> And, oh, what a joy.<br> Dr. Evans! Dr. Evans!<br> The jury is ready<br> to come back.<br> You'll be needed in there.<br> You're going to win<br> this case, Son. I'm sure<br> you're going to win it.<br> It doesn't matter now.<br> Yes, it does.<br> More than you'll ever realize.<br> I don't know why,<br> but I loved her. From the<br> moment I saw her, I loved her.<br> I know.<br>
