                        Wow! Bob, take it easy!<br> - Easy? Where does that get you?<br> - On dry land, I hope!<br> It's doing 150 or better.<br> He's coming in, believe it or not.<br> Help Miss Daniels off.<br> - I'm making another run.<br> - It's not safe out there!<br> That's why you'll just watch.<br> - It's starting to kick up, Mr Merrick.<br> - You keep this engine toned, that's all.<br> What's wrong with him?<br> Hasn't he got any brains?<br> He doesn't have to.<br> He's got four million bucks.<br> He must be doing<br> better than 180 now.<br> I knew that would happen!<br> Miss Daniels, phone Emergency right<br> away! Come on, Joe, hurry up!<br> - He's starting to breathe, Bill.<br> - I'll switch off the ventilator.<br> - That was a close one.<br> - Bob Merrick just lives right.<br> - Is that the ambulance?<br> - Yeah. Nothing more we can do here now.<br> All right, everybody. There's nothing<br> to see. You can take off now.<br> Go ahead.<br> Return the resuscitator to Dr Phillips'<br> home as soon as possible. Emergency.<br> They want the resuscitator<br> right away, Bill.<br> Leaving assignment now. Victim being<br> picked up by a hospital ambulance.<br> - Return the resuscitator...<br> - Yes, I know.<br> Returning the resuscitator<br> to Dr Phillips.<br> - Did they say why they wanted it?<br> - Just to rush it back to Dr Phillips' house.<br> Hurry. Dr Phillips. An accident.<br> - What's the trouble, Miss Ashford?<br> - Take it inside to Dr Phillips, Bill.<br> - Did you see Mrs Phillips' car anywhere?<br> - No, we didn't.<br> Oh, I hope they get back in time.<br> We're at Dr Phillips'.<br> Is it too chilly to eat on the terrace? We<br> could fix the tables with hurricane lamps.<br> Helen, it's a lot of swank for practically<br> no reason. You bought out half the town.<br> Isn't a wedding anniversary<br> enough reason to have a party?<br> - Wait till you get married.<br> - But a six months anniversary?<br> I've never been married six months before<br> and I want to tell the world that I love it.<br> Shouldn't you have<br> given Dad some hint?<br> I should say not! He'd have<br> nine reasons at the hospital<br> why he couldn't come<br> home for dinner.<br> Wayne can invent an emergency<br> operation at the drop of a hat<br> if he knows he's to be the guest<br> of honour at a dinner party.<br> Now what's the matter?<br> I was just thinking of the<br> toast I'd give you two.<br> To Wayne Phillips, a great surgeon,<br> a fine man and my wonderful father.<br> And to you. Love and<br> affection to my mother.<br> Mother? Oh, Joyce, you wouldn't.<br> You married my father. You're certainly<br> the only mother I've ever known.<br> And I'm all in favour<br> of the arrangement.<br> I sure feel sorry for them.<br> Oh, Joyce, it's so pleasant. We can have<br> dinner outside without any trouble at all.<br> - Helen...<br> - Nancy, what are you doing over here?<br> - Oh, Helen...<br> - What's the matter?<br> - It's Wayne.<br> - What?<br> He's had an accident.<br> Dr Dodge is with him.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Here. Oh, Helen...<br> Helen...<br> - Wayne had an attack and...<br> - No.<br> Dad!<br> Those poor girls.<br> He was such a wonderful man.<br> He did so much for people.<br> Why, Dr Dodge? Why?<br> How many times I've been<br> asked that question.<br> I've never learned the answer.<br> Nancy, you go in with her.<br> Joyce, I know there's<br> nothing I can say.<br> What happened, Derwin?<br> Nancy and I had come from the hospital<br> to go sailing with him this afternoon.<br> He must have had the occlusion just<br> a few minutes before we got here.<br> We saw him down at the<br> pier, all slumped over.<br> - The resuscitator didn't help at all?<br> - No. It wasn't here.<br> - It wasn't here?!<br> - No.<br> But Dad's kept it here for years because<br> he had a coronary. You knew that.<br> In heaven's name, where was it?<br> Bob Merrick capsized his boat<br> at the other end of the lake.<br> - The police came for it just before this...<br> - Bob Merrick!<br> Oh, you don't know him. I do.<br> He's a stupid, spoilt darn fool.<br> And now, to think Bob Merrick is<br> alive because of Dad's resuscitator<br> and Dad is dead...<br> I could kill him!<br> Helen...<br> Helen...<br> I loved him so much, Derwin.<br> With all my heart.<br> And we only had these few<br> short months together.<br> I don't know how you're supposed to do it.<br> Just take the barge out and get her up.<br> Don't bother me with<br> excuses. Get it done.<br> When does Campbell<br> get in from Detroit?<br> I don't want anybody else touching<br> those engines. Don't argue.<br> - If I may take your temperature.<br> - Nonsense. I'm not even lukewarm.<br> That's better. And have Jerry call me as<br> soon as he hears about the insurance.<br> - Am I getting out of here today?<br> - The very instant you're able to leave<br> we shall be happy to<br> sign your discharge.<br> - But first...<br> - This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy.<br> A small respiratory infection, a slight<br> concussion, but no subdural clot.<br> A subdural clot, Doctor, is a haematoma<br> anywhere in the cranial cavity.<br> Thank you. I merely wondered where<br> you acquired that piece of information.<br> Let me have a line. I was in med<br> school when my father died.<br> I haven't wasted all my time.<br> Why did you quit?<br> Too rough for a Merrick?<br> I'll tell you why.<br> My father died at 42...<br> Hello. Val?<br> Who?<br> No.<br> Suddenly it seemed sensible to enjoy life<br> while I could. Let me have another line.<br> My, how you've succeeded<br> Hello, Val. How have<br> you been, baby?<br> Don't go in, Nancy. You have to make a<br> formal request to take his temperature.<br> When I think Dr Phillips died<br> so that he could live.<br> Yes. What a complete waste.<br> - Have you talked to Helen today?<br> - No. Not since yesterday.<br> She's coming over this morning to<br> go through the doctor's things.<br> You can count on it, baby.<br> It's a date. Goodbye.<br> Would you do me a favour? Get Dr Phillips<br> down here to look at me so I can get out.<br> - Here.<br> - Look, I haven't got a temperature.<br> It's immaterial to me, Mr Merrick,<br> but I'm going to take your<br> temperature one way or another.<br> - A human being.<br> - Under the tongue, please.<br> Where have you been all week?<br> What kind of an establishment<br> is this? Will you tell me?<br> I've been here five days and I'm<br> treated like a leper. No visitors.<br> - It seemed advisable.<br> - My doctor doesn't even come.<br> No, when Dr Albert<br> talked to Dr Dodge,<br> he agreed the case didn't warrant his<br> coming up. He's very busy in New York.<br> Then why don't I get Wayne Phillips?<br> It's his hospital, isn't it?<br> It's obvious I get to pay his bill.<br> - Don't look shocked. I'm used to it.<br> - I wasn't shocked, Mr Merrick.<br> - I was only thinking.<br> - You were thinking what?<br> I was thinking, when your father left<br> you the Merrick Motor Company millions,<br> what a pity he couldn't also bequeath<br> you a little common courtesy.<br> I don't know where you got those<br> pyjamas, or these cigarettes...<br> your pharyngitis is bad<br> enough without them.<br> In words of one syllable, Mr<br> Merrick, you talk too much.<br> Now that's settled, how about getting Doc<br> Phillips to give me my separation papers?<br> The reason the staff may have<br> seemed so distant, Mr Merrick,<br> is that Dr Phillips<br> died a few days ago.<br> It was rather sudden and he was<br> quite admired by all of us.<br> - All you had to do was tell me.<br> - It hasn't been easy to talk about.<br> When will I get out? I have too<br> many things to do that can't wait.<br> I can't say. Perhaps in a few days.<br> Wanna bet?<br> Brightwood Hospital.<br> - Miss Phillips, these came this morning.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - Is Mrs Phillips in?<br> - Yes, she is.<br> They're still coming. Amazing,<br> isn't it? Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Yes, thank you. All right,<br> we'll see you. Goodbye.<br> That was Tom. He's in the<br> village and coming over.<br> He seemed a little more<br> urgent than he had to be.<br> I suspect that lawyer of mine just<br> wanted to spend the afternoon with you.<br> Dottore Vittorio Laradetti, Rome.<br> I had no idea there were so many<br> people who respected Dad so much.<br> And who felt so much in his debt.<br> From all over the country.<br> From all over the world.<br> Listen to this, Joyce.<br> "Dear Mrs Dr Phillips, you don't know me,<br> but I owe everything to Dr Phillips."<br> Yes, come in.<br> Sorry, but there's another lady<br> here to see you. A Mrs Eden.<br> She says she has to talk to you.<br> - Want me to talk to her?<br> - No... Have her come in, Nancy.<br> - Mrs Eden.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Mrs Phillips, Mrs Eden.<br> - How do you do, my dear?<br> - How do you do? Won't you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> We'll have to be very firm<br> about visitors, for her sake.<br> Yesterday afternoon there were eight.<br> This morning it's beginning again.<br> Apparently Dad had helped<br> them meet some crisis.<br> - Money?<br> - No, not always. Sometimes just advice.<br> But when you try to pin them down as<br> to how they became indebted to Dad,<br> they stammer and dodge, as though they<br> belonged with him to some secret society.<br> It's strange.<br> Dr Phillips insisted<br> that it be kept secret.<br> But now that he's dead, I suppose<br> I can talk about it, don't you?<br> Certainly.<br> It came to $4,000 all together,<br> and I want to pay you back.<br> Why didn't you return<br> it to Dr Phillips?<br> Oh, my dear, I tried so many<br> times, but he wouldn't take it.<br> He'd become excited and say,<br> "You haven't told anyone?"<br> I'd say, "Of course not.<br> You told us not to."<br> Then he'd say, "That's right, Mrs Eden.<br> Any help I give you is just between us."<br> - And he wouldn't let you repay it?<br> - He said he couldn't because...<br> he'd already used it all up.<br> And then he'd say to invest it.<br> "Invest in what?" I'd say.<br> And he'd say, "Any poor devil."<br> Wasn't that strange?<br> Mrs Eden, what did he mean<br> when he said "used it all up"?<br> I've tried to think so many times.<br> Don't you know, Mrs Phillips?<br> No. It's very odd. In four letters this<br> week, there's exactly the same expression.<br> But it is a debt, and I<br> want to take care of it.<br> You don't owe me<br> anything, Mrs Eden.<br> If Dr Phillips couldn't accept<br> this, then neither can I.<br> Well... if that's what you<br> want, Mrs Phillips, but...<br> You keep it and use it...<br> for any poor devil.<br> All right.<br> He was a very remarkable<br> man, wasn't he?<br> Yes, he was.<br> Perhaps more remarkable<br> than any of us knew.<br> - Hello, darling. How are you?<br> - Much better now that you're here.<br> - How's Helen feeling?<br> - Oh, you know.<br> - Oh, golly, Tom. I've missed you.<br> - I've missed you too.<br> Hello, Tom. Thank you for<br> coming all this way.<br> Helen. I wish I'd been able to come<br> up Sunday, but I've been swamped.<br> I wanted to talk to both<br> of you about the estate.<br> The estate? I hadn't<br> even thought of it.<br> Neither had I. I should have<br> been a better attorney.<br> I've made a complete survey<br> of Wayne's finances, and I...<br> - I doubt you'll have any money at all.<br> - Not even insurance?<br> Wayne had a $100,000 policy,<br> but he borrowed the maximum on it.<br> - The rest might pay the taxes and debts.<br> - But what happened, Tom?<br> But some of Dad's fees...<br> the Talleyrand operation...<br> When Wayne removed the neoplasm from<br> the Talleyrand boy, he received $25,000.<br> It was all withdrawn within seven weeks<br> in four cheques, all made out to "cash".<br> The account's full of cash withdrawals.<br> Where did all this money go, Helen?<br> Wayne didn't discuss money with me.<br> I really wouldn't know.<br> That leaves you and Joyce with<br> the house and little else.<br> And the hospital is liable to<br> be in very rocky shape too.<br> Can't something be worked out, Tom?<br> I want to go over his records and find<br> out what other assets he might have.<br> Those you'll let me<br> collect for you, that is.<br> And after that, well, we'll<br> see where you stand exactly.<br> Well, thank you very much<br> for all your trouble.<br> And you do as you feel best.<br> - Will you excuse me?<br> - Certainly.<br> I have to go to the house. The gardener's<br> confused about what bulbs to lift this fall.<br> I promised I'd do it.<br> It can't wait any longer.<br> I'll see you both at the house.<br> - Can I help?<br> - I suspect you could help... tremendously.<br> Are you all right?<br> Adequate as can be.<br> - Going to the village?<br> - Yes. Can I give you a lift?<br> You certainly can.<br> I'll make it. I'll make it.<br> - What seems to be the trouble?<br> - Long story. You wouldn't be interested.<br> You live around here?<br> Yes.<br> I should have collapsed on<br> one of these roads long ago.<br> - I meant it in the nicest way.<br> - I'm sure you did.<br> - You don't sound like it.<br> - I'm sorry, but I have a lot on my mind.<br> That's all right. So do I.<br> Can't we talk about it better<br> after I take you to lunch?<br> I think not.<br> Before you decide I'm just a character<br> who stumbled out of the woods, Miss P...<br> Monogram on your purse.<br> My name is Phillips...<br> Mrs Wayne Phillips.<br> Oh.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs Phillips.<br> You know, I just heard<br> about your husband.<br> I'm really sorry. He must have<br> been a really great person.<br> It's a rough way to go.<br> Maybe they'll get another<br> resuscitator now.<br> Resuscitator? Did they<br> try to use one on him?<br> We'd have had his at the house, but<br> there was an accident on the lake<br> and the police took it there.<br> You mean...<br> the accident Bob Merrick had?<br> Yes. Bob Merrick.<br> So...<br> Bob Merrick is alive,<br> and only because your husband...<br> Let me out up here, will you?<br> - Thanks.<br> - Are you sure you're all right?<br> He can't have just disappeared.<br> Miss O'Malley, flash Dr Dodge.<br> All right, thanks.<br> There's work to do.<br> Have Dr Dodge report to the<br> front desk immediately.<br> - Helen. What's the matter?<br> - I just gave a man a ride on the lake road.<br> He's in shock or exhausted.<br> He's in the car.<br> Frank, get a stretcher.<br> It's Bob Merrick.<br> Who?<br> Come on. I want you to rest<br> a little while, Helen.<br> It's... It just came<br> before I was ready for it.<br> I know, darling.<br> - I'm all right, Nancy.<br> - Don't talk about it.<br> Come in and lie down<br> a little while.<br> I don't know, Nancy.<br> Maybe it's just as well.<br> I'll never have to see him again.<br> Brightwood Hospital.<br> Mrs Phillips?<br> I'm sorry, I can't ring her.<br> Yes, Mr Merrick?<br> - Is my bill ready?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Mrs Phillips is in Dr Phillips' office<br> and she's asked me to hold her calls.<br> Thank you. I will give Mrs<br> Phillips your message.<br> Your bill, Mr Merrick.<br> You've answered so many questions that<br> have been puzzling me, Mr Randolph.<br> Several people in the last few days<br> have mentioned Wayne's way of life.<br> And when they talk about "using it all up",<br> I had no idea what they meant.<br> I'm so happy that<br> you could tell me.<br> You don't talk much<br> about this belief.<br> When someone's ready for<br> it, they accept it.<br> Perhaps Wayne felt you weren't ready...<br> or that you were pretty perfect without it.<br> Well, I must be going.<br> Wayne mentioned so many times how<br> anxious he was for me to meet you.<br> I'm sorry it was under<br> these circumstances.<br> I flew up from Mexico as soon as I heard.<br> I thought possibly I might be able to...<br> Make it a little easier for me?<br> Well, you have.<br> Thank you.<br> - We'll be seeing you very soon, I hope.<br> - Yes. I'll be back in my studio now.<br> Mrs Phillips,<br> I want to talk to you.<br> - I'm very busy.<br> - Oh, I was just leaving.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, and thank you.<br> You and I don't have<br> anything to talk about.<br> - I know how you feel about me.<br> - Please leave me alone.<br> Your husband was an<br> eminent surgeon.<br> Everybody's saying that a character like me<br> is still around while your husband is...<br> Here.<br> - And what is that supposed to do?<br> - Supposed to do?<br> Most people'd be<br> very glad to get it.<br> Will paying thousands help<br> you forget it happened?<br> It's all very simple to you... a cheque<br> can take care of anything, any time.<br> Most people would be very<br> happy to receive $25,000.<br> Was it my fault? I didn't ask<br> you for your resuscitator.<br> Smash up somebody's car,<br> write out a cheque.<br> Get in a mess with a showgirl,<br> write out a cheque.<br> And when a man dies, write out a cheque<br> to his widow... account paid in full.<br> - Listen...<br> - Leave me alone!<br> When you go to Mexico City,<br> you must hear Rosario.<br> His voice is just divine.<br> It does things for me.<br> Good for you. But he doesn't<br> sound like my type.<br> Pardon me.<br> It's one of the most beautiful<br> things I've ever seen.<br> - The owner must have spent a fortune.<br> - Good for him.<br> It's got all kinds of gadgets.<br> It's got... red-spoke wheels...<br> What did they do to<br> you in that joint?<br> I know your big trouble, honey.<br> You need Val to take care of you.<br> The principal<br> difficulty seems to be,<br> the anaesthetics you get in these bars are<br> never as effective as the customer hopes.<br> - What, honey?<br> - Good night, baby.<br> - How about a drink, Val?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Don't you want to take me home?<br> - That's an interesting idea.<br> I'll call you.<br> So long and farewell.<br> - Yes?<br> - I'm sorry to bother you this time of night.<br> I just clobbered my car<br> in the ditch. Look.<br> That's all right. Come in.<br> Thank you for your hospitality.<br> It's a nice place you have here.<br> A very nice place indeed.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Me? Of course.<br> It takes more than pranging up a car<br> to incapacitate old Bob Merrick,<br> pride of the Merrick clan.<br> You're Bob Merrick, eh?<br> - Who are you?<br> - Edward Randolph.<br> - How do you... Who?<br> - It's all right. I live here.<br> Edward... may I please bother you...<br> for a telephone, please?<br> - Of course.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Gotta call somebody to<br> come and pick me up.<br> - Must tell 'em to wear their safety belts.<br> - Right back here.<br> - Where?<br> - Right back here.<br> Oh.<br> Go slow.<br> Hello?<br> Hello there.<br> - Ed, did you do these pictures?<br> - Yes.<br> Nice.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> Art is just a guy's name.<br> - Williams?<br> - Shouldn't you dial?<br> Shh! Williams.<br> This is Robert Merrick Esquire.<br> I had a little trouble with my car. Would<br> you come over and pick me up, please?<br> Williams?<br> Don't snore, old man. Wake up.<br> Hardest thing these days,<br> getting good help.<br> Very nice job.<br> Where have we met? Don't tell<br> me, don't tell me. I met you...<br> - Is that?<br> - It's a portrait I did of Wayne Phillips.<br> Phillips.<br> Phillips.<br> He's the man who's haunting me.<br> You know what?<br> I almost drowned, but a resuscitator<br> saved me. Whose is it? Dr Phillips'.<br> They shoot me to a hospital to make old<br> Merrick good for another 20,000 miles.<br> Whose hospital? Dr Phillips'.<br> Then I meet her. A girl.<br> A girl who is...<br> a very beautiful girl.<br> Whose wife is she? One guess, pal.<br> - Now look here, Merrick...<br> - Tell me where we've met.<br> In the hospital.<br> In Dr Phillips' office.<br> Dr Phillips.<br> You see?<br> He is haunting me.<br> - I'm glad you made it.<br> - I'm not sure I have.<br> Try this anyway.<br> Do you mind telling<br> me what happened?<br> Oh... I wrecked the<br> car, in a ditch.<br> Yes. The right front wheel. I called your<br> house and asked someone to come over.<br> - I hope you don't mind.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Think a shower'd help?<br> - I certainly do.<br> Make it a cold one. Up those<br> stairs and to the right.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> I hope I wasn't too much<br> trouble last night.<br> When I pass out, I usually<br> like to be in my own bed.<br> No trouble.<br> Oh, I know where I saw you.<br> With Helen Phillips.<br> That's right, Merrick.<br> Will you take these?<br> - Have you known her long?<br> - No.<br> But Wayne Phillips was<br> the best friend I had.<br> Coffee's ready.<br> Yes, the portrait you did of him.<br> It's really good.<br> You're quite a painter.<br> Well, maybe I am now.<br> If so, I have Phillips to thank. He's<br> the one who unlocked everything.<br> - Phillips did?<br> - Yes. I met him some years ago<br> when I was still trying to find my<br> way in painting, getting nowhere.<br> I spent my life making fairly<br> adequate copies of the masters.<br> I always wanted to<br> create like they did.<br> But I just never could.<br> Until Phillips showed me<br> how to get what I wanted.<br> How did he do that?<br> How could a surgeon help?<br> Well, he taught me...<br> He showed me how to establish contact<br> with a source of infinite power.<br> That sounds fine.<br> What does it mean?<br> Well, let me put it this way.<br> This lamp isn't working now.<br> It's cold, and it's dark. All the parts<br> are there, it's a perfect light, but...<br> - It's just not turned on.<br> - Right.<br> But if I turn the switch<br> and establish contact,<br> the bulb will draw power<br> from the powerhouse<br> and it'll do what it was meant<br> to do, which is to make light.<br> So you're saying that people<br> have a sort of powerhouse too.<br> Establish contact with that and you<br> can do what you're meant to do.<br> - You can fulfil your destiny.<br> - I can turn on a light.<br> I don't think that's your destiny.<br> - Do you?<br> - No, I guess not.<br> Assuming there is a power of some kind,<br> how do you establish contact with it?<br> It's very simple: Just be<br> of real service to people.<br> Find people who need<br> help, and help them.<br> But always in secret.<br> Never let it be known.<br> And never ask to be repaid.<br> But why does it have<br> to be kept secret?<br> That's probably the most<br> important part of this belief.<br> Let's go back to the powerhouse.<br> If the wires in the dynamo are<br> not protected by insulation,<br> the power will be dissipated.<br> The same goes for us.<br> Most personalities are just grounded.<br> That's all that ails them.<br> I see. You mean keeping<br> these good deeds secret<br> is like insulating the<br> power of your personality.<br> - Yeah, that's near enough.<br> - If it works, fine. Obviously it helped you.<br> Isn't there anything in<br> the world that you need<br> that you haven't been able<br> to get in the ordinary way?<br> Not a thing.<br> Except...<br> I'd like to square myself<br> with Helen Phillips.<br> Oh?<br> But if I just help out some poor joker, why<br> does it follow that she'll listen to me?<br> I think you might be<br> surprised at what follows<br> after trying this way of life.<br> Well, if it's as simple as all that,<br> why, I'll certainly give it a chance.<br> Wait, Merrick.<br> Don't try this unless you're ready. You<br> can't just try it for a week like a new car.<br> And if you think you can feather your<br> own nest with it, just forget it.<br> Besides, this is dangerous stuff.<br> One of the first men who used it<br> went to the cross at the age of 33.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Won't you come in, please?<br> - I understand that Mr Merrick...<br> - I'm here, Williams.<br> - Good morning, Mr Merrick.<br> Well, goodbye. And thanks. You take<br> good care of a drunk and his hangover.<br> I ought to know how by this time.<br> I've been there myself.<br> Mr Merrick! It's good to<br> see you around again.<br> Hello, Dan.<br> No. Another look you owe me.<br> - How's the family?<br> - Not so hot. We lost the baby, you know.<br> - Oh?<br> - The missus is still in the hospital.<br> - The bills are pretty rough.<br> - I'm sorry to hear it, Dan.<br> - Say, Dan.<br> - Yes, Mr Merrick?<br> How much do you need<br> for all the expenses?<br> About $300 would do it.<br> - Mr Merrick...<br> - It's yours. On two conditions.<br> - Anything.<br> - Don't tell anybody.<br> - I've got to tell my wife.<br> - No, not even your wife.<br> And never try to pay it back.<br> I don't want it.<br> - Anything you say.<br> - Good.<br> But this is sure a funny way<br> to help a guy out, isn't it?<br> I think you're absolutely right.<br> - I don't believe it!<br> - Your order, Mr Merrick?<br> It does work.<br> Thank you, Phyllis. Joyce and I will see<br> you again soon. We won't hibernate.<br> - I'm glad of that.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Mrs Phillips. This is more than just a<br> coincidence. I've got to talk to you.<br> - I was just leaving.<br> - You have two minutes, haven't you?<br> Perhaps I wasn't as diplomatic as I could<br> have been, but I did mean well, really.<br> We've all been under a strain. Sorry<br> if I said anything I shouldn't have.<br> What I can't understand is how we've<br> avoided knowing each other before this.<br> It wasn't intentional,<br> I assure you.<br> I think we ought to correct<br> that mistake. Don't you?<br> Of course. I'm very late.<br> Mrs Phillips.<br> We haven't decided where we're<br> going to have dinner tonight.<br> I have a previous engagement.<br> Excuse me.<br> Please don't go!<br> I'd like to ask you... about<br> this theory of Dr Phillips'<br> that Edward Randolph<br> was telling me about.<br> - Why would he talk to you about it?<br> - I guess he believes in it.<br> I guess I'm starting to,<br> after meeting you here.<br> What has meeting me<br> got to do with it?<br> Well, I... I just did something.<br> I'm going to go find somebody that<br> needs a couple of thousand bucks<br> and my worries will be over.<br> I think you've twisted my husband's<br> beliefs into something very cheap.<br> Taxi!<br> Wait a minute!<br> - 15 Lake Drive, please.<br> - Mrs Phillips.<br> - I wouldn't offend you for the world.<br> - Just drive on.<br> - Wait here. Mrs Phillips...<br> - Please don't start a scene.<br> I'm only trying to tell you that...<br> Look out!<br> Brightwood Hospital.<br> The line is busy. Will you hold?<br> I'll try to locate him for you.<br> Brightwood Hospital.<br> I'll take a message.<br> I can connect you now.<br> Brightwood Hospital.<br> - Is there any chance at all?<br> - No.<br> How about the x-ray findings?<br> They leave no hope.<br> She's lucky to be alive.<br> Will you tell them, Nancy?<br> - All right.<br> - Thank you.<br> Miss Ashford...<br> Joyce.<br> She's going to live.<br> And she'll be all right in time?<br> Not completely. There's<br> an inoperable lesion.<br> - What is it?<br> - Where?<br> Well... Her eyes.<br> Tell me, Nancy.<br> Let me have it straight.<br> She'll be blind.<br> - Blind?<br> - It can't be.<br> Oh, no!<br> - Miss Ashford, could I see her?<br> - Haven't you done enough?!<br> - Joyce...<br> - It's the truth. Why shouldn't I say it?<br> She'll never see again, thanks to you.<br> Write a cheque for that, Mr Merrick!<br> No, Nancy. No.<br> Darling, don't you think if<br> you just talk to him once...<br> What good would it do?<br> What could he possibly say?<br> And what difference<br> would it make now?<br> I don't blame him for<br> anything, Nancy.<br> It's just that I feel it's better<br> if I don't see him at all.<br> Well... I'll send him away.<br> I'm sorry, Mr Merrick.<br> She won't see you.<br> Nancy?<br> Yes, darling.<br> I know I'm right.<br> He'll finally give up.<br> - Your things are on the beach, Helen.<br> - Thank you, Nancy.<br> - Is Judy there?<br> - Yes. She's waiting for us.<br> - Call me when you're ready to go down.<br> - I will.<br> - Some more tea, Helen?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Is Nancy staying with you?<br> - No.<br> She comes and takes me down<br> to the beach, picks me up later,<br> whenever she can get<br> away from the hospital.<br> - I'm going to miss you terribly, Ed.<br> - Well, I hate to say goodbye.<br> But I've refused the<br> gallery so many times,<br> and I do have to be in Chicago<br> at least once this year.<br> You've been wonderful all these months,<br> and I apologise for being a handful.<br> Uh-uh, Helen. Quiet.<br> Well, I'd have thrown me in the<br> drink if I were me. Thank you.<br> But, Ed, I get so tired of<br> learning how to eat and dressing<br> and finding out where<br> the heck things are.<br> I get so tense, and then I'm<br> a problem to everybody.<br> Of course you have to have<br> people around to help you.<br> So do several geniuses<br> that I could mention.<br> But you're such a good friend.<br> - And don't forget that.<br> - No.<br> Sorry I had to miss Joyce.<br> Say goodbye for me.<br> Yes, I will. She's in town. It's<br> about that accident insurance.<br> Thank goodness for that.<br> It's kept us going.<br> Well, goodbye.<br> You'll be hearing from me.<br> God bless you.<br> - I'll get Nancy.<br> - No, not yet.<br> Where's my radar?<br> No, no, no. As a farewell present for<br> you, I'm going to try something.<br> For the first time, in your honour,<br> down to the cove all by myself.<br> - But you've never gone down there alone.<br> - Well, it's about time I start.<br> - I'd better go partway with you.<br> - Oh, no. Just stay and watch.<br> I know these steps by heart.<br> One...<br> two...<br> three...<br> Helen?<br> Where did Helen go?<br> - That's progress for you.<br> - It's remarkable!<br> Judy!<br> Hi, Helen!<br> Say, what do you know!<br> - You started exploring by yourself!<br> - How about that!<br> - I'm sorry I'm late, Judy.<br> - Me too. I gotta get back early.<br> I thought you weren't coming, so I<br> went ahead and read the whole chapter.<br> Serves me right for being late.<br> What happened?<br> Well, old Huckleberry's on<br> this crazy raft with Jim,<br> and they run into this<br> old, deserted houseboat.<br> - Huck... Here's a step.<br> - Oh. Thank you.<br> One, two, three, four, five steps.<br> Now let's see.<br> Where was I? Oh, yes.<br> Huck thinks maybe they<br> can scrounge something,<br> so he starts to investigate in<br> all this dirt and disorder.<br> He opens this door and finds two fellas<br> talking in a very rough fashion.<br> Well, here we are.<br> Take it easy, now.<br> These characters are<br> very hostile indeed.<br> And?<br> Tune in tomorrow,<br> same time, same station.<br> Shall do.<br> What's going on out<br> on the lake, Judy?<br> Oh, I'd say there's<br> about a ten-knot blow,<br> and about a half-dozen<br> snipes having a race.<br> And a couple of stars foolin'<br> around by the yacht club.<br> And a real gone daddy zoomin'<br> around with his inboard.<br> Aw, some babe's water-skiing.<br> Not so hot. She's usin' both hands.<br> - Sounds like a big day.<br> - Yeah!<br> Hate to rush, Helen, but OK<br> if I do the newspaper now?<br> Sure. But what's the hurry?<br> Mother stuck me with Susan<br> Shacker's birthday party.<br> Can you imagine me in a dress?<br> Well... In Europe,<br> things aren't so hot.<br> In the Pacific,<br> things aren't so hot.<br> And in Washington...<br> If you want to know my opinion,<br> things are pretty fouled up all over.<br> Page 3. Here's a girdle and bra ad... which<br> I won't be needing for quite a while.<br> I'm a dog to run off, I know. But what<br> can you do with parents, eh, Helen?<br> Nothing, I guess. But we'll<br> be together tomorrow.<br> Sure. Want me to<br> take you back up?<br> No, I think I'll sit here for<br> a while. I'm all right.<br> OK. You're a big girl now.<br> - See you!<br> - Bye.<br> Hey, handsome!<br> Yeah, you, Tarzan!<br> I'm stuck! Wanna help<br> me launch my boat?<br> A girl's in real tough shape when she's<br> got no figure and no muscles either.<br> Thanks! Stick around!<br> I think we can use you!<br> Bye, Helen!<br> Goodbye!<br> Thank you for your help.<br> Sure.<br> I didn't know anyone else was here.<br> Do you come to the cove often?<br> Well... lately a little.<br> I've noticed you and<br> Judy a few times.<br> Well, I'm Mrs Phillips.<br> And I hope any friend of<br> Judy's is a friend of mine.<br> How do you do, Mrs Phillips?<br> - And you're?<br> - Rob... My name's Robinson.<br> Well, you know, it's a bit<br> chillier than I thought.<br> Oh, dear. I'm sorry, but would you<br> help me find my shawl? I don't see.<br> Of course.<br> I'm very awkward, I guess, but<br> Judy's a wonderful builder-upper.<br> I don't think anybody could come<br> through any better than you have.<br> - With a subdural haematoma like yours...<br> - That's where I met you. At the hospital.<br> - You're a doctor.<br> - No. We've never met.<br> I know a little about medicine.<br> I studied to be a surgeon once.<br> - But I have heard your voice, haven't I?<br> - I don't think so, Mrs Phillips.<br> - Is there anything else I can do?<br> - No, thank you. I'm very comfortable.<br> Mrs Phillips, I wonder...<br> Would it be all right if<br> I came by occasionally?<br> Just for launching outboards<br> and general morale purposes?<br> - I hope I'm not imposing.<br> - Of course not.<br> We'll hope to see you<br> again very soon.<br> Yes. Soon.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> I hope that I've been able<br> to make myself clear.<br> What you say you want to do is the<br> best news that anyone could tell me.<br> But I warn you, the investment<br> of one's life in others<br> and the alignment of oneself with<br> the forces that lead up and on,<br> - this does not come cheap.<br> - I don't expect it to be.<br> Once you go into it, you're bound.<br> You'll never be able to give it up.<br> You'll find this furnishes your<br> motive power. It will obsess you.<br> But, believe me, it'll be<br> a magnificent obsession.<br> - Thank you, Williams.<br> - A Mr Masterson is here.<br> - Any mail?<br> - Yes, sir. On your desk.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - I haven't waited long.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - Yes. Thank you.<br> How are plans developing?<br> I made the last deposit to<br> Mrs Phillips' account today.<br> Sit down.<br> That completes the<br> amount you wanted paid.<br> - Good. Any problems?<br> - No, but...<br> Joyce asked some very<br> pertinent questions.<br> It is a lot of money. But they're<br> both convinced it was insurance.<br> - You haven't mentioned this to anyone?<br> - No.<br> Good.<br> - You don't approve of me, do you?<br> - Well, I...<br> Perkins and Little have been the<br> Merrick attorneys for years.<br> So I thought it strange<br> you called me last month.<br> That's why. Nobody would suspect anything<br> from you as originating with me.<br> And you can start practising some more,<br> because here comes a high, fast one.<br> I talked to Dr Giraud<br> at the medical centre.<br> - The brain man?<br> - Yes. Best diagnostician in the country.<br> I once studied with him.<br> He says there's some chance...<br> a very, very small chance...<br> that Helen Phillips' prognosis<br> may not be hopeless.<br> Really?<br> He says if doctors like Emil Hofer in<br> Zrich, Fuss in Vienna, Lehman in Munich<br> could be persuaded to take her case, they<br> might be able to devise a way to operate.<br> But you couldn't get them all<br> over here in a million years.<br> We could get her over there. Hofer won't<br> leave Zrich, so it has to be Switzerland.<br> Today Dr Giraud heard from Fuss. He<br> and Lehman could be there this spring<br> for periodic consultations.<br> They're willing to tell her they're taking<br> the case as a gesture to her late husband.<br> You get all kinds of people to do<br> what you want, don't you, Merrick?<br> That's fine, but... the expense. Somebody<br> will have to be with her all those months.<br> Persuade her and Joyce<br> to sell the house.<br> Who'd buy it?<br> I know somebody who needs a<br> place exactly like that.<br> He'll pay what some people might<br> think is a lot more than it's worth.<br> Think it over. Figure out the best<br> way to present it all to her.<br> Of course, don't let anyone<br> know about this either.<br> - No one.<br> - No, of course not.<br> Um... What are you going<br> to do with the house?<br> I don't want any part of it.<br> You'll find a worthy use for it.<br> Merrick, I, uh...<br> I take back a lot of things<br> I thought about you.<br> That's nice of you to say so.<br> - What's all this?<br> - False knots.<br> One of the first things<br> you learn in med school.<br> You are wrapped up in this. Well,<br> goodbye. I'll be talking to you.<br> Thanks. I'll find my way out.<br> What you're asking is to change your manner<br> of living... which is your business...<br> but also to pick up a<br> career which you dropped.<br> Probably the most demanding<br> career you could choose.<br> If you don't go on this time, we've tied<br> up good people and priceless facilities...<br> - which is my business.<br> - I'm still asking it.<br> If I can go back and graduate, will you<br> let me intern here at the medical centre?<br> All right, Bob Merrick.<br> We'll try it.<br> I've done a lot of things in medicine<br> I was warned were impossible.<br> You won't regret it.<br> When you studied with me years ago,<br> why weren't you so enthusiastic?<br> - What a lot of time you've wasted!<br> - Yes, what a lot of time.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> The marshal gets on his white horse<br> and rides off with Wise Eagle.<br> The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon<br> them varmints'll head through the pass?"<br> - Wise Eagle says...<br> - "Ug!"<br> The marshal says, "We gotta<br> head 'em off. Come on."<br> Next picture's the sheriff's office.<br> The marshal says:<br> "Sheriff, what idea you got in that ornery<br> head of yours to stop them desperadoes?"<br> The sheriff says...<br> "Marshal, I don't like using shootin'<br> irons, but if I gotta use shootin' irons,<br> I tell you, there ain't no<br> hombre this side of the Pecos<br> is any better with shootin'<br> irons, less'n it's you."<br> And Wise Eagle says...<br> Oh. "Ug!"<br> We're gettin' better!<br> Listen, you two. Forget about the funnies.<br> I can't keep quiet any longer.<br> - Silence, Judith.<br> - OK, Helen. Shoot.<br> First of all, some of the best eye<br> doctors in Europe are interested in me,<br> because of my husband, I guess.<br> They want me to come<br> over for a consultation.<br> - Helen, I couldn't be happier.<br> - Gee, that's marvellous! For free?<br> Practically. But not the trip itself...<br> that's the other good news.<br> So many wonderful<br> things have happened.<br> We have the most fabulous offer for<br> the house and the lake frontage.<br> Enough for an income<br> for Joyce and me.<br> If the buyer takes the Brightwood acreage,<br> the hospital will be in good shape too.<br> It's about time your life turned.<br> It's ironic... I've never been to Europe,<br> and when I go, I won't be able to see it.<br> But what a place to open your eyes.<br> I have to leave by the end of<br> the month for Switzerland.<br> I'll miss you two, for a long time.<br> Heck, Helen. I'll write.<br> Heck, Helen. I'll write.<br> Switzerland sounds dreamy! You can get<br> a Swiss watch and learn to yodel!<br> She's practically lived on the beach.<br> This Robinson must be a dreamboat.<br> - Haven't you met him yet?<br> - She's keeping him all to herself.<br> I think it's wonderful. It looks as if<br> they really mean a lot to each other.<br> You know, it's very strange<br> knowing you only like this.<br> So well, it seems, and yet...<br> I've never seen your face.<br> - Hi, Joyce!<br> - Hi, Judy!<br> - Any room left on the beach for us?<br> - Sure. You kiddin'?<br> Helen, the news sounds just wonderful,<br> but I'm afraid I have to go.<br> Oh, no. No, don't go. It's Joyce, and<br> now you'll have a chance to meet her.<br> Joyce!<br> Happy Sunday, Helen.<br> Joyce dragged me along.<br> At long last, everybody. This is<br> Joyce Phillips, Tom Masterson,<br> and this is Robbie Robinson I've<br> been telling you so much about.<br> - Hello.<br> - How do you do, Mr... Robinson?<br> How do you do?<br> I'm sorry. I'm just on my way to the<br> village. I'm glad to have met you.<br> Don't forget tomorrow.<br> Goodbye, Helen.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Mr Robinson!<br> - Joyce!<br> Could I ask you a favour?<br> - Tom!<br> - Yes, Helen?<br> - Tom, what's wrong?<br> - Why, nothing, Helen.<br> - What is this?<br> - Look, Joyce, you don't understand.<br> I sure don't. Hasn't she had enough trouble<br> from you without this fantastic lie?<br> Believe me, I'm only trying to make<br> her life a little less lonely.<br> Fine. Wouldn't it be wonderful for her to<br> fall in love with someone named Robinson<br> and then open her eyes<br> and see that it's you?<br> That would make us all glad<br> we're living, wouldn't it?<br> Get out, Merrick. Get out<br> of her life and stay out.<br> So long, pardner!<br> - Goodbye, Helen.<br> - Goodbye, Tom.<br> Come on, Helen.<br> - Goodbye, Tom.<br> - Goodbye, Nancy.<br> Hurry up, Joyce.<br> I love you, darling.<br> I'm coming.<br> - Bye, darling.<br> - Goodbye, dear.<br> Hello, Merrick.<br> Everything's going to be all right.<br> Now, Mrs Phillips, tell me<br> if you see a little light.<br> Do you?<br> No.<br> Do you notice a light now?<br> No, I'm sorry, gentlemen.<br> Mrs Phillips, do you<br> have headaches?<br> Yes.<br> Constantly, or periodically?<br> - Periodically.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Where?<br> In the back of my head.<br> Any dizzy spells?<br> Occasionally.<br> Difficulties in walking?<br> No... No.<br> Well, I think that<br> does it for today.<br> Well, Doctors? What's the verdict?<br> You must be patient, Mrs<br> Phillips, you know.<br> There are tests and tests.<br> We are making progress.<br> But I did distinguish some light yesterday,<br> and it was the same test, wasn't it?<br> What does it mean?<br> If you can bear with us, madame,<br> in time we'll find out.<br> Oh, I don't know how<br> they dare call this tea.<br> Back home it'd be a<br> six-course lunch.<br> Why did I ever memorise<br> that calorie chart?<br> I'm glad that's finished. Now I'm<br> only three letters behind Tom.<br> - Want some tea, dear?<br> - Yes, thank you, Nancy.<br> - Joyce?<br> - Yes?<br> I'd like to send a note to Robbie Robinson,<br> if it wouldn't be too much trouble.<br> Well, no.<br> - Aren't you tired? It can wait, can't it?<br> - You should rest and relax,<br> - not worry about your social obligations.<br> - It's no obligation. He'll be interested.<br> And I want it to make the next<br> plane... just a note, Joyce.<br> And you can say...<br> that the tests have started<br> and we're all very optimistic.<br> And, uh... tell him<br> that I miss him...<br> and to say hello to Judy...<br> and the only part of Switzerland that<br> we've encountered is a hospital.<br> is a hospital.<br> How do you explain it, Doctor? Her letter<br> sounds so optimistic, yet your reports...<br> Now, now, Bob. How long has<br> she been there? A few weeks?<br> Only Fuss and Hofer<br> have seen her so far.<br> Naturally their reports to us<br> are going to sound cautious.<br> Cautious? I'd say they<br> were pessimistic.<br> Don't worry so much. Everything which<br> can be done for her is being done.<br> I know.<br> After all, we never anticipated more<br> than a medical possibility, did we?<br> A medical possibility.<br> Mrs Phillips! Good morning.<br> - You're Dr Fuss?<br> - Yes. Dr Fuss.<br> - Please, sit down, Mrs Phillips.<br> - Oh, and you're Dr Hofer.<br> - Jawohl.<br> - Good morning, madame.<br> - And you're Dr Lehman.<br> - You're right.<br> You see? I'm beginning<br> to recognise all of you.<br> Well, at long last, the great day.<br> I want you to know that<br> I've shot the works, too.<br> That's American slang. That<br> means a new dress, a new hat...<br> Now I want to know when you're going<br> to make a new girl out of me.<br> Mrs Phillips, you have been close<br> to medicine for a few years.<br> You know the relationship<br> of doctor and patient.<br> You know that there is very little to<br> be gained by not facing the facts.<br> Why, of course.<br> By all means, face the facts.<br> What are they?<br> We are very sorry, Mrs Phillips,<br> but we are agreed that, for the<br> present, we can do nothing.<br> No operation?<br> - Nothing?<br> - We've searched every avenue, I believe.<br> That's not to say there is no hope.<br> In a case like yours, after<br> several years sometimes...<br> Several years, Doctor?!<br> We feel that it would be unwise and<br> unkind to submit you to surgery now.<br> But you know that I'll let you experiment<br> if there's any chance at all...<br> the longest chance in the world.<br> We regret to say, but the<br> indications are not there.<br> Oh.<br> Well, if the indications<br> aren't there, then...<br> I guess that's that.<br> You've done everything<br> that you could.<br> It was a gamble.<br> We all knew that it was<br> a gamble and I just...<br> well, I just lost, that's all.<br> But... I want to thank you.<br> I want to thank you for<br> being so kind to me and...<br> and giving me all your time.<br> I really can't thank you enough.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - And...<br> - Goodbye, Mrs Phillips.<br> The last must be Dr Lehman.<br> My child...<br> I am so sorry.<br> Well, I... I thought I was<br> going to get rid of these.<br> Isn't it nice that... that<br> I didn't throw them away?<br> She's sound asleep.<br> What has she done that<br> all this happens to her?<br> Golly. How she took it today...<br> I don't know how she stands<br> up under everything.<br> If it happened to me, I'd go to pot<br> in a handbasket. I think I'd even...<br> I'm proud of you, Joyce.<br> It hasn't been an easy<br> year for you either.<br> Well, I'll go get these drops and<br> this new prescription filled.<br> - Nancy, do me a favour.<br> - Of course. What?<br> Stay away from here for a while<br> and relax yourself for a change.<br> All right. I do need some fresh air.<br> I'll be back in an hour.<br> - Darling. I thought you were asleep.<br> - I heard the door. Was it Nancy?<br> Yes. She went out for a while. I can get<br> you one of your pills and some hot milk.<br> Joyce, I don't need any sleep.<br> Oh, yes, I do too.<br> It's so awful in bed.<br> It's funny, but... the<br> night-time is the worst time.<br> It does get darker, you know.<br> And then, when I finally<br> do get to sleep,<br> I know that, when I wake up in the<br> morning, there won't be any dawn.<br> Joyce...<br> Joyce, forgive me.<br> I didn't mean to<br> parade my emotions.<br> Maybe I do need a pill.<br> Would you mind getting<br> me some warm milk?<br> Of course not.<br> Just sit down here.<br> I'll only be gone a moment.<br> I'll just go down to the hotel<br> kitchen and warm some milk.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, dear, I'm all right.<br> Joyce?<br> No.<br> It's Rob.<br> Rob?<br> Oh, I can't believe it.<br> - It's been so long.<br> - Much too long.<br> When you didn't come to the plane,<br> and you hardly wrote all these months...<br> Oh, I'm so glad you're here!<br> You must have known how<br> much I need you now.<br> Darling.<br> Robbie, my trip has been wasted.<br> - I found out today my case is hopeless.<br> - Don't talk about it.<br> I came to tell you you're gonna<br> have the time of your life with me.<br> I'll take you all the places you've been too<br> busy to visit, show you how to have fun.<br> - But I'll be such trouble.<br> - Listen, Helen.<br> You used to let me read you the funnies.<br> Let me be your eyes again.<br> Now get dressed. Something<br> to bowl everybody ever.<br> I'm not only gonna show you the town,<br> I'm gonna show the town you.<br> Oh, Robbie.<br> Joyce?<br> Joyce?<br> Yes, Helen?<br> Look who's here. Robbie Robinson.<br> It's like Old Home Week.<br> This is a surprise.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> We're gonna get dressed up to the teeth.<br> I'm going to initiate that new net dress.<br> Joyce, will you please<br> come and help me?<br> Oh!<br> Oh, I'm all right.<br> I won't be very long.<br> - I'll be back in just a moment, Helen.<br> - All right, Joyce.<br> Bob Merrick, I...<br> I want to apologise.<br> You? For what?<br> That girl you just saw is quite a<br> change from the girl this afternoon.<br> They told her she's<br> never going to see.<br> I know. I just came<br> from the institute.<br> They've been keeping<br> in touch with me.<br> Anybody that can do what you've<br> done for her is OK with me.<br> I never believed names<br> were too important anyway.<br> - Joyce!<br> - Coming!<br> It's wonderful being with you.<br> I don't want it to end, ever.<br> Let's not think of it.<br> Tonight is our night.<br> Yes, tonight is our night.<br> Oh, and the fragrance<br> in the air... What is it?<br> - Lilacs?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> And there's a moon...<br> as there should be.<br> Oh, and just ahead there's<br> lights of a little old town.<br> Just as there should be.<br> Excuse me a second, darling.<br> - Ich nehme diesen hier.<br> - Danke.<br> I thought you might like these.<br> - Lilacs?<br> - Mm-hm. For luck.<br> And more lilacs.<br> What's going on?<br> Let's find out.<br> Wenn ich das erklren darf?<br> - Das ist ein lokales Volksfest.<br> - It's a local festival.<br> - Man verbrennt die Hexe.<br> - They're burning a witch.<br> - Damit wir eine gute Ernte haben.<br> - For a good harvest.<br> - Mit Musik und Feuerwerk.<br> - With music and fireworks.<br> There she is, darling. Way up on top of<br> a pile of branches about 20 feet high.<br> Poor old gal's stuffed with straw,<br> just like our scarecrows back home.<br> And on the ground just below her, boys<br> and girls in peasant dress are dancing.<br> Now they're setting fire to her.<br> There she goes.<br> Fireworks bursting<br> all over the place.<br> - Now everybody's starting to dance.<br> - I'd like to dance too.<br> You would?<br> I always dance with my<br> eyes closed anyway.<br> - I won't tell you what time it is.<br> - I don't want it to stop.<br> I don't want to lose this place,<br> or the music, or the night.<br> You don't have to lose it.<br> I'd forgotten how happy I could be.<br> You've helped me know that the world<br> isn't such a bad place after all.<br> - You don't hate it any more?<br> - Not any more.<br> Could you... forgive anything now?<br> I think so.<br> Yes.<br> Even... Bob Merrick?<br> Why...<br> Yes, Bob.<br> Of course.<br> How long have you known?<br> I don't really remember when I first had<br> the feeling that... Does it really matter?<br> I love you, and I<br> want to marry you.<br> Darling, if we only could.<br> But I couldn't have you pitied<br> because of me. I love you too much.<br> - Helen, I need you more than anything.<br> - Bob... Tomorrow.<br> Let me tell you tomorrow.<br> All right.<br> Starting tomorrow,<br> we'll never be apart.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Well... it's really<br> good night this time.<br> Oh, I wish it weren't.<br> There's a brand-new<br> day in a few hours.<br> Even better.<br> Nothing could be better, darling.<br> I love you.<br> Oh, Bob.<br> Oh. The key.<br> The key.<br> Helen!<br> - Did you have a good time?<br> - A wonderful time.<br> How pretty.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - I'll see you in the morning.<br> - Yes.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Nancy.<br> I'll take the flowers, Helen.<br> Oh, they're so pretty.<br> It was too wonderful, Nancy.<br> He wants to do so much for me.<br> Helen, what's the matter?<br> He wants to marry me, Nancy.<br> I love him. I can't let him do it.<br> - Well, if you love him and he loves you...<br> - I don't know. I don't know.<br> I don't know anything any more.<br> - Nancy, please don't leave me.<br> - Of course I won't.<br> You've got to help me.<br> Helen?<br> Nancy?<br> Where is everybody?<br> Hello?<br> Oh, yes, please. Have him come up.<br> Helen, Rob...<br> Hello? Get me the desk, please.<br> Come in.<br> I see.<br> Good morning. Couldn't order<br> a better day if we tried.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> Is Helen dressed? I hope<br> you're not allergic to lilacs.<br> Bob... What happened<br> to you two last night?<br> - Did you tell her who you were?<br> - Yes. But she knew anyway. Joyce...<br> I, uh... I asked her to marry me.<br> Oh, Bob.<br> - She's gone.<br> - She's?<br> - Where?<br> - I don't know.<br> Away with Nancy,<br> early this morning.<br> Oh, here. She left<br> this note for you.<br> "Dear Bob. Goodbye."<br> "I'm sure this is<br> best for both of us."<br> "You have your study and work now,<br> and I could only be a burden."<br> "If you love me,<br> don't try to find me."<br> "Just know you made me happier than<br> I dreamed I could ever be again. Helen."<br> I phoned downstairs. Nobody<br> knows where she went.<br> - We've got to go after her.<br> - But, Bob...<br> We'll talk about it on the way.<br> We've got to find her.<br> Miss Phillips, Mr Merrick, we are<br> doing everything to trace them...<br> as are the police all over Europe.<br> But from Milano... nothing to report.<br> Paris... no findings. Rome... nothing.<br> You'd think in five weeks we'd<br> be able to find some trace.<br> I am truly sorry, sir.<br> But, you know,<br> even in your country,<br> if someone really wants to<br> disappear, it is not too difficult.<br> - However, we shall not give up.<br> - Thank you, Captain. Goodbye.<br> I know what a sense of loss and<br> disappointment you both have,<br> but look at these telegrams.<br> Our Inter-Europa Agency has<br> tried everything, I assure you.<br> Da ist ein Telegramm fr mich?<br> Dankeschn.<br> We have exhausted<br> all possibilities.<br> Inter-Europa.<br> Oui, madame. Lundi,<br> cinq... Exactement.<br> Pas de quoi, madame.<br> But we will be in touch<br> with our New York people.<br> And I will keep on the lookout here<br> for the two of them booking<br> passage to America.<br> Here are your tickets.<br> Bon voyage. Have a nice trip.<br> It was a pleasure serving you.<br> Darling, you're home.<br> Oh, am I glad to see you!<br> - Welcome home, Bob.<br> - Hello, Tom. Good to see you.<br> - Nothing? No trace?<br> - None.<br> She must come back to the States.<br> Sooner or later they'll get in touch.<br> - Strange how things work out, isn't it?<br> - Yeah, strange.<br> What are your plans?<br> I don't know. I guess I'll...<br> go up to Brightwood for a while.<br> The marshal gets on his white horse<br> and rides off with Wise Eagle.<br> The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon<br> them varmints'll head through the pass?"<br> - Wise Eagle says...<br> - "Ug"<br> - Mr Merrick?<br> - Yes.<br> Mr Randolph had to leave<br> Brightwood for a few months.<br> Will you excuse me? I just came<br> over to close up the house.<br> Yes, certainly.<br> Once you go into it, you're bound.<br> You'll never give it up.<br> You'll find it'll furnish your motive<br> power. It will obsess you.<br> But, believe me, it'll be<br> a magnificent obsession.<br> - Chris, here's Doctor.<br> - Dr Merrick!<br> - All ready to leave us, Chris?<br> - All set.<br> - Good!<br> - I wanna show you something.<br> Oh. All right.<br> Look at me.<br> Not dizzy or anything. You<br> sure know how to operate!<br> Dr Barnes had more to<br> do with it than I did.<br> Now I can go to that new school out in<br> the country. They got horses and dogs.<br> That's just fine. Goodbye, Chris.<br> Just a minute, Doctor. Chris,<br> I want to talk to Doctor a minute.<br> Dr Merrick, you've<br> been wonderful to us.<br> Not just here in the hospital.<br> You arranged that school for Chris,<br> and my husband's job at the plant.<br> - You haven't told him that I?<br> - No. That's just between us, like you said.<br> But in a few years, when Chris<br> understands about money...<br> No, Mrs Miller. I told you<br> there's nothing to repay.<br> In a few years it'll<br> be all used up anyway.<br> - All used up?<br> - That's right, Mrs Miller. Goodbye.<br> I had quite an experience at the golf club.<br> After 20 years I almost got a hole in one.<br> I took her to a beautiful French restaurant,<br> but all she wanted was spaghetti.<br> Bob Merrick!<br> Dr Giraud! For heaven's sake!<br> How are you?<br> - You're underweight, but you look fine.<br> - I feel fine.<br> Doctors, please! This<br> is a very tense moment.<br> Check.<br> Say, what are you doing here?<br> Just been seeing your chief. He told me<br> you did a nice job on that trephining.<br> I told him I taught you all you know.<br> You'll be a real neurosurgeon after all.<br> That's the idea, Doctor.<br> Never hurts to take time off<br> to build up the batteries.<br> I took a week off. Went to Joyce<br> and Tom Masterson's wedding.<br> - When was that?<br> - Well, let's see.<br> She's in Maternity now with her first baby.<br> It must have been a year ago.<br> Maybe work is the best answer.<br> You... never heard anything again?<br> No. I never heard from her. Supposedly<br> she and Nancy came back to the States.<br> Dr Merrick, please.<br> You're being paged. Must be<br> an important man, Doctor.<br> Don't stay away so long, Doctor.<br> We need critics around here. Goodbye.<br> The book says if they don't<br> gain it back in five days...<br> Book, shmook. There ought to be a law<br> new fathers couldn't read anything.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello, Doctor.<br> - Tom.<br> - How's the little mother?<br> - A lot littler.<br> I have a formal complaint. Some nurse<br> came and took my baby away.<br> All you can supply is psychological<br> nourishment, which she doesn't need yet.<br> - Everything all right?<br> - Fine. I go home Monday.<br> Good. I'll look in on you tomorrow.<br> - Give little Helen an extra hug for me.<br> - Sure.<br> Goodbye, Doctor.<br> He's doing his life<br> over the hard way.<br> I imagine any other way<br> would be the hard way now.<br> - Good evening, Doctor.<br> - Good evening, Williams. Thank you.<br> - Hello, Bob.<br> - Edward Randolph. Good to see you.<br> How long have you been here?<br> I phoned the hospital. They<br> said you were on your way home.<br> And...<br> What is it?<br> Helen.<br> - Do you know where she is?<br> - Nancy called.<br> Said she was breaking her word...<br> thank goodness she did.<br> - Helen must be desperately ill, Bob.<br> - What?!<br> They're afraid of pneumonia,<br> other complications.<br> - Where are they?<br> - In a little hospital in New Mexico.<br> Shadow Mountain.<br> I've already called about tickets.<br> - How soon can we leave?<br> - The 9:00 plane. We'll get there at dawn.<br> Doctor, that's their car.<br> - At last you're here.<br> - Finally.<br> - I've only done what she asked me.<br> - I know. How is she?<br> In a coma. No change since<br> you called from the airport.<br> - Dr Allan, Dr Merrick, Mr Randolph.<br> - How do you do? This way, Doctor.<br> Nancy...<br> She was admitted a month ago.<br> May I see the history, please?<br> It's the pneumonococcus now.<br> When she was admitted,<br> headaches, nausea,<br> not connected with her<br> blindness at all.<br> It's pressure. Have you<br> done a spinal puncture?<br> One. Starting yesterday, she<br> deteriorated so fast, we had to.<br> Another odd thing. This apparent paralysis<br> of the left arm and the respiratory centre.<br> Couldn't be a stroke.<br> The onset was so gradual.<br> No. But it could be a fibroma.<br> Her old injury.<br> I know something about it.<br> It might have caused a clot<br> which became organised<br> and fibrotic.<br> I...<br> always dance...<br> with my eyes closed.<br> Well, Doctor? What do you suggest?<br> If we could only get Henry<br> Giraud to fly out here.<br> There isn't time for that.<br> Is there?<br> No, there's no time for that.<br> I agree. We should operate<br> as soon as possible.<br> Let's have a look at Surgery.<br> - Doctor...<br> - This way?<br> Doctor, I couldn't do it.<br> I've never used a Hudson Burr.<br> - Isn't there anyone else?<br> - Here? This is just a private sanatorium.<br> Four of us on the staff. Not one of<br> us could take that responsibility.<br> - Do you want it?<br> - I?<br> I don't have enough experience.<br> - You can't expect me to...<br> - Bob.<br> A chance in a thousand.<br> A chance in a million.<br> You've got to give it to her.<br> Edward, I can't.<br> You're not gonna let everything you've<br> lived for all these years slip away?<br> You've gone so far, Bob. So far.<br> I'd give my life to save her.<br> You just give your skill.<br> You're ready for it.<br> Now you're gonna repay that old, old<br> debt in a way that you never imagined.<br> Nancy, will you help scrub?<br> I'll be glad to, Doctor.<br> Remove the dressing.<br> We're almost ready, Doctor.<br> Dr Merrick?<br> - What's the trouble?<br> - Doctor, you begin. I'll stand by.<br> Just a moment, please, Doctor.<br> You can't let that girl down.<br> You just can't!<br> Nancy, I'm not up to it.<br> I just won't be able to...<br> Nancy, let's start.<br> - Ready?<br> - Go ahead.<br> All right, Doctor.<br> It was the longest and<br> roughest operation I ever saw.<br> Pretty feathery there<br> for a while, wasn't it?<br> It's going to be feathery<br> until she comes to.<br> - You'd better get some rest now.<br> - No.<br> Thank you, Nancy,<br> but I couldn't sleep.<br> - I'll make some coffee for you.<br> - All right.<br> Doctor.<br> Nancy?<br> Nancy's here. I'm here.<br> - Doctor?<br> - Yes.<br> You must be quiet.<br> It doesn't hurt so much.<br> You're going to get better.<br> Who is it?<br> Who's here?<br> It's Bob.<br> Bob?<br> Oh, Bob, I'm so glad you're here.<br> Hold me.<br> Hold me close.<br> I didn't know.<br> You didn't tell me.<br> Lie still. Please.<br> What is that?<br> Helen, you've got to be quiet.<br> But I think I see some light.<br> Are you sure?<br> You mustn't talk. Just rest.<br> But I'm going to see! I know I am!<br> Am I?<br> Yes, my darling.<br> You are going to see.<br> I can see you.<br> Please lie still. You must.<br> Don't get excited. Not today.<br> May I... May I get excited tomorrow?<br> Yes.<br> And you'll be with me?<br> Yes, darling. I'll be<br> with you tomorrow.<br> Starting tomorrow,<br> we'll never be apart.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Oh, tomorrow.<br> Once you find the<br> way, you'll be bound.<br> It'll obsess you.<br> But, believe me, it'll be<br> a magnificent obsession.<br>
