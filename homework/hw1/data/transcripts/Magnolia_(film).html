                        In the "New York Herald..."<br> November 26,year--1911...<br> there is an account|of the hanging of three men.<br> They died for the murder|of Sir Edmund William Godfrey...<br> husband,father, pharmacist...<br> and all-around|gentleman resident...<br> of Greenberry Hill, London.<br> He was murdered|by three vagrants...<br> whose motive was simple robbery.<br> They were identified as...<br> Joseph Green...<br> Stanley Berry...<br> and Daniel Hill.<br> Green, Berry, Hill.<br> And I would like to think this|was only a matter of chance.<br> As reported|in the "Reno Gazette..."<br> June of 1983...<br> there is the story of afire...<br> the water that it took|to contain the fire...<br> and a scuba diver|named Delmer Darion.<br> Employee of the Nugget Hotel|and Casino, Reno, Nevada...<br> engaged as a blackjack dealer.<br> Well-liked and well-regarded...<br> as a physical, recreational,|and sporting sort...<br> Delmer's true passion|was for the lake.<br> As reported by the coroner,|Delmer died of a heart attack...<br> somewhere between|the lake and the tree...<br> but most curious side note...<br> is the suicide the next day|of Craig Hansen...<br> volunteer firefighter,|estranged father of four...<br> and a poor tendency to drink.<br> Mr. Hansen was the pilot of|the plane that accidentally...<br> lifted Delmer Darion|out of the water.<br> Added to this,|Mr. Hansen's tortured life...<br> met before with Delmer Darion|just two nights previous.<br> All l need is a two.<br> All you need is a deuce.|All right.<br> That is an eight.<br> Glad you like my work.|Moment of truth.<br> The weight of the guilt...<br> and the measure|of coincidence so large...<br> Craig Hansen took his life.<br> And l am trying to think...<br> this was all only|a matter of chance.<br> The tale told|at a 1961 awards dinner...<br> for the American Association|of Forensic Science...<br> by Dr. John Harper,|president of the association...<br> began with|a simple suicide attempt.<br> Seventeen-year-old|Sydney Barringer...<br> in the city of Los Angeles|on March 23, 1958.<br> The coroner ruled that|the unsuccessful suicide...<br> had suddenly become|a successful homicide.<br> To explain--the suicide|was confirmed by a note...<br> in the right hip pocket|of Sydney Barringer.<br> At the same time young Sydney|stood on the ledge...<br> an argument swelled|three stories below.<br> The neighbors heard,|as they usually did...<br> the arguing of the tenants...<br> and it was not uncommon|for them...<br> to threaten each other|with a shotgun...<br> or one of the many handguns|kept in the house.<br> I'm going to put you down!<br> And when the shotgun|accidentally went off...<br> You asshole!<br> Sydney just happened to pass.<br> What?<br> Shut the fuck up!<br> Added to this,|the tenants turned out to be...<br> Fay and Arthur Barringer...<br> Sydney's mother and father.<br> When confronted|with the charge...<br> which took some figuring out|for the officers on the scene...<br> Fay Barringer swore she did not|know the gun was loaded.<br> She always threatens me with it,|but l don't keep it loaded.<br> And you didn't load the gun?<br> Why would l load the gun?<br> A young boy|who lived in the building...<br> sometimes a visitor and friend|to Sydney Barringer...<br> said that he had seen,|six days prior...<br> the loading of the shotgun.<br> Ricky, come here a minute.<br> It seems that all|the arguing and fighting...<br> and violence was far too much|for Sydney Barringer...<br> and knowing his mother and|father's tendency to fight...<br> he decided to do something.<br> He said he wanted them|to kill each other...<br> and all they wanted to do|was to kill each other...<br> and he would help them do that|if that's what they wanted.<br> Sydney Barringer jumps|from the ninth floor rooftop.<br> His parents argue|three stories below.<br> Her accidental shotgun blast|hits Sydney in the stomach...<br> as he passes the arguing|sixth floor window.<br> He is killed instantly,|but continues to fall...<br> only to find,|five stories below...<br> a safety net|installed three days prior...<br> for a set of window washers|that would've broken his fall...<br> and saved his life--if not|for the hole in his stomach.<br> So Fay Barringer was charged|with the murder of her son...<br> and Sydney Barringer noted as|an accomplice in his own death.<br> And it is in the humble opinion|of this narrator...<br> that this is not just|"something that happened."<br> This cannot be|"one of those things."<br> This, please, cannot be that.<br> And for what|l would like to say, l can't.<br> This was not just|a matter of chance.<br> These strange things|happen all the time.<br> In this big game|that we play, life...<br> it's not what you hope for|or deserve...<br> it's what you take.<br> I'm Frank T.J.
