Everywhere he's gone...<br> ...he's created havoc.<br> Everywhere he's gone,<br> he's created destruction.<br> So I charge him with being<br> the greatest kidnapper on this earth!<br> I charge him with being the greatest<br> murderer on this earth!<br> I charge him with being the greatest<br> robber and enslaver on this earth!<br> I charge the white man...<br> ...with being the greatest swine-eater<br> and drunkard on this earth!<br> He can't deny the charges.<br> You can't deny the charges!<br> We're the living proof of those charges!<br> You and I are the proof.<br> You're not an American.<br> You are the victim ofAmerica!<br> You didn't have a choice coming here.<br> He didn't say:<br> "Black man, black woman, come over<br> and help me build America."<br> He said, "Nigger, get in the boat.<br> I'm taking you over there to help me<br> build America."<br> Being born here<br> does not make you an American.<br> You and I are not American. You're one<br> of the 22 million black people...<br> ...who are victims ofAmerica.<br> You and I, we've never seen democracy.<br> There's no democracy in the fields<br> of Georgia.

Your<br> grandmother's smarter than you think.<br> I'm sorry she raised me that way.<br> Is your mother alive?<br> Yes, she's alive.<br> When I was a kid, I was so poor<br> I thought "not for sale"...<br> ...was a brand name.<br> I did knock.<br> Did you hear me say, "Come in"?<br> There's no point in fighting about it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - May I sit down?<br> - You're nice enough to ask.<br> It's the same questions, Mrs. Little.<br> - Since your husband's death...<br> - Murder. Murder.<br> ...there's a question as to whether you<br> can raise these children alone.<br> These are my children.<br> They're mine.<br> And they ain't no question.<br> Sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor<br> is the only kindness.<br> All your children are delinquent...<br> ...and one at least,<br> Malcolm, is a thief.<br> Get out!<br> Your control over your<br> children is nonexistent.<br> Did you hear me?<br> You will regret this.<br> If you don't move through that door,<br> you'll be past regretting!<br> We were parceled out, all of us.<br> I truly believe that if ever<br> a state agency destroyed a family...<br> ...it destroyed ours.<br> I was sent to a detention<br> home and lived at this woman's house.<br> Mrs. Swerlin.<br> Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.<br> We'll treat him like a brother.<br> I was special.

I was<br> aware that he was in the room with me.<br> He wore a dark suit,<br> and on his face I saw a wisdom...<br> ...and pain so old and deep<br> that I could scarcely look at him.<br> But I knew I wasn't dreaming.<br> He was there with me.<br> I tell you...<br> ...the most dangerous creation<br> in the world...<br> ...in any society...<br> ...is the man with nothing to lose.<br> You do not need 10 such men<br> to change the world.<br> One will do.<br> The earth belongs to us...<br> ...the black man.<br> And whatever is around it...<br> ...or on it, or in it...<br> ...belongs to us.<br> And then as suddenly as he came...<br> ...he was gone.<br> And then I could do it.<br> We're taught that Paul...<br> ...on the road to Damascus,<br> heard the voice of Christ.<br> He was so smitten by the truth<br> that he fell from his horse.<br> Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...<br> ...but I do understand.<br> You see, it happened to me.<br> Why me?<br> Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back<br> in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.<br> We don't have much,<br> but what we have is yours.<br> My wife and my sonjoin me in saying<br> that when you come out...<br> ...which won't be long,<br> come straight to us.<br> Next.<br> What'll it be?<br> Take it all off.<br> - Getting rid of that conk, huh?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You write, thanking me.<br> Don't thank me, thank Allah.<br> He did it all.<br> Dear Brother Baines:<br> Please thank Elijah Muhammad<br> for the money...<br> ...and tell him<br> I haven't written him...<br> ...because I've<br> not yet proven myself.<br> But I have shared his teachings<br> with old running buddies in Harlem...<br> ...and with my main man, Shorty,<br> who was transferred upstate.<br> All praises due to Allah<br> for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.<br> I wrote the mayor, the governor<br> and the President...<br> ...but for some reason<br> I haven't heard from them."<br> Please tell Elijah...<br> ...I have dedicated my life to telling<br> the white devil the truth to his face.<br> I greet you with the ancient words<br> of peace, "As-Salaam-Alaikum."<br> P.

Front page!<br> I must emphasize at the start that<br> Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.<br> So I'm not here this afternoon<br> as a Republican nor as a Democrat.<br> Not as a Mason nor as an Elk.<br> Not as a Protestant nor a Catholic.<br> Not as a Christian nor a Jew.<br> Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist.<br> In fact, not even as an American.<br> Because if I was an American...<br> ...the problem that confronts our people<br> today wouldn't even exist.<br> So I have to stand here today<br> as what I was when I was born...<br> ...a black man.<br> Before there was any such thing as a<br> Republican or a Democrat, we were black.<br> Before there was any such thing<br> as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.<br> Before there was any such thing as a Jew<br> or a Christian, we were black people.<br> In fact, before there was any such place<br> as America, we were black.<br> And after America has long passed<br> from the scene...<br> ...there will still be black people.<br> I'm gonna tell you like it really is!<br> Every election year, these politicians<br> are sent up here to pacify us.<br> They're sent here and set up here<br> by the white man.<br> This is what they do.<br> They send drugs in Harlem down here<br> to pacify us!<br> They send alcohol down here<br> to pacify us!<br> They send prostitution down here<br> to pacify us!<br> You can't get drugs in Harlem<br> without the white man's permission.<br> You can't get prostitution in Harlem<br> without the white man's permission.<br> You can't get gambling in Harlem<br> without the white man's permission.<br> Every time you break the seal<br> on that liquor bottle...<br> ...that's a government seal<br> you're breaking.<br> I say, and I say it again,<br> you been had.<br> You been took.<br> You been hoodwinked.<br> Bamboozled. Led astray.<br> Run amuck. This is what he does.<br> You know, some people<br> call this hate-teaching.<br> This isn't hate-teaching.<br> This is love-teaching.<br> I wouldn't tell you this<br> if I didn't love you.<br> I wouldn't stick my neck out for you<br> if I didn't love you.<br> I want you to understand one thing:<br> Everything I teach you...<br> ...everything I have said to you...<br> ...has been taught to me<br> by this dear man.<br> This divine man.<br> All praise is due to Allah<br> for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.<br> Attallah's fine.<br> And she misses you as much as I do.<br> But the news that you've dedicated<br> four new temples is almost as good...<br> ...as having you with us.<br> Oh, dear heart.<br> - White supremacy, try to hide their<br> guilt by accusing Elijah Muhammad...<br> ...of being a black supremacist...<br> ...simply because he's trying<br> to uplift the mentality...<br> ...the social and economic condition<br> of his people.<br> And the Jews who have been guilty<br> of exploiting black people...<br> ...try to hide their guilt<br> by accusing Elijah Muhammad...<br> ...of being anti-Semitic...<br> ...simply because he's trying<br> to teach you and l...<br> He's trying to teach you and I...<br> ...to be in charge of the businesses<br> in our own community.<br> To own the businesses<br> in our own community.<br> To have economic leadership<br> in our own community.<br> No, this isn't black supremacy...<br> ...this is black intelligence.<br> The black people in this country...<br> ...have been the victims<br> of violence...<br> ...at the hands<br> of the American right wing...<br> ...for 400 years.<br> Four hundred years.<br> Four hundred years.<br> We thought by following<br> those ignorant Negro preachers...<br> ...that it was God-like<br> to turn the other cheek...<br> ...to the group<br> that was brutalizing us.<br> A hundred years ago,<br> they used to put on white sheets...<br> ...and sic bloodhounds on us.<br> Nowadays, they've traded in<br> the sheets...<br> Some have traded in the sheets...<br> They've traded in the sheets...<br> Please, please.<br> They've traded in those white sheets<br> for police uniforms.<br> They traded in the bloodhounds<br> for police dogs.<br> Andjust like Uncle Tom<br> back during slavery time...<br> We must remain true to nonviolence.<br> I'm asking everybody in the line.<br> If you can't be nonviolent,<br> don't get in it.<br> - To love our enemy and pray<br> for those who use us spitefully.<br> You've got chicken-pecking Uncle Tom,<br> so-called Negro leaders today.<br> And it's another great day.<br> You've got these Uncle Tom<br> Negro leaders today...<br> ...that tell us we ought to pray<br> for our enemies.<br> We ought to love our enemy<br> and integrate with the enemy...<br> ...who bombs us, who kills<br> and shoots us, who lynches us...<br> ...who rapes our women<br> and children. No!<br> No! That's not intelligent.<br> That's not intelligent.<br> Elijah Muhammad is trying<br> to teach you and I...<br> ...that just as the white man<br> and any other man on this earth...<br> ...has the God-given right,<br> the human right, the civil right...<br> ...the natural right, and any other<br> rights you can think of...<br> ...to protect himself...<br> ...just as this white man has<br> the right to defend himself...<br> ...we have the right<br> to defend ourselves too.<br> This is only natural. This is what<br> Elijah Muhammad is trying to teach.<br> He's not teaching us<br> to hate the white man.<br> He's teaching us to love ourselves.<br> Mr. X, before we begin<br> our discussion tonight...<br> ..."The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...<br> ...would you mind explaining for us<br> the meaning of your name...<br> ...which is the letter "X"?<br> During slavery time,<br> the slave master...<br> ...gave the Negro...<br> the so-called Negro...<br> ...named the so-called Negro<br> after themselves.<br> Elijah Muhammad teaches us...<br> ...that once we come into the knowledge<br> of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves...<br> ...we replace our slave name<br> with an "X"...<br> ..."X" in mathematics representing<br> the unknown.<br> Since we've been disconnected,<br> or cut off from our own history...<br> ...our own past, our own culture,<br> our own land...<br> ...we use the "X," the unknown,<br> until we get back to our country.<br> I see. Thank you. Dr. Payson?<br> Mr. X is a...<br> He's a demagogue.<br> He has no place to go,<br> so he exaggerates.<br> He's a disservice to...<br> ...every good, law-abiding, church-going<br> American Negro in the country.<br> Why do you teach black supremacy?<br> Why do you teach hate?<br> Well, for the white man...<br> ...to ask the black man...<br> ...why he hates him...<br> ...is like the wolf asking the sheep,<br> or the rapist asking the raped...<br> ..."Do you hate me?"<br> The white man is in no moral position<br> to accuse the black man of anything.<br> This is a black man<br> asking the question.<br> What would you call an educated Negro<br> with a B. A., an M. A., a B. S. Or a Ph. D?<br> You call him a nigger.<br> That's what the white man calls him.<br> You have to understand this thinking.<br> To understand this type of man,<br> you must understand that historically...<br> ...there were two types of slaves:<br> The house Negro and the field Negro.<br> The house Negro lived in the house...<br> ...next to his master. In the big house,<br> in the basement or the attic.<br> He dressed good, he ate good,<br> what the master left him.<br> He loved his master.<br> He loved his master better<br> than the master loved himself.<br> If master said, "We got a nice house,"<br> you say, "Yeah, we got a nice house."<br> Master's house caught on fire,<br> the house Negro...<br> ...would put the blaze out.<br> If the master got sick, he'd say,<br> "What's the matter? We sick?"<br> "We sick"! This is the thinking<br> of the house Negro.<br> If another slave said...<br> ..."Let's run away, let's separate<br> from this cruel master"...<br> ...he said, "Why? What's better<br> than what we got here?<br> I'm not going anywhere."<br> This is the house Negro.<br> In those days, we called them<br> house niggers.<br> That's what we call them today because<br> we still got a lot of house niggers.<br> Dear Holy Apostle...<br> ...the ministers think Malcolm is<br> getting too much press.<br> They think he thinks he is<br> the Nation of Islam.<br> That he has aspirations<br> to lead the Nation.<br> It was you who made Malcolm<br> the man he is.<br> You lifted him out of darkness.<br> You go and tell the brothers...<br> ...that what the Brother Minister...<br> ...is doing, has done...<br> ...has been of great benefit<br> to the Nation.<br> And you tell them that I say so.<br> The ministers think he is<br> of great benefit to himself.<br> One at a time.<br> - Did you say white people are devils?<br> - I said they're devils.<br> Should all black men be armed?<br> Well, one of your most<br> famous men said:<br> "Praise the Lord and pass the<br> ammunition." That's the way you think.<br> Do you think your cause<br> will be successful?<br> I sincerely hope so.<br> - Do you advocate violence?<br> - No, sir.<br> Has a white man helped your people?<br> Has there been a white man<br> that's helped my people?<br> - Correct.<br> - I don't understand the question.<br> You preach anti-white,<br> anti-Christian science.<br> You're saying you're anti-white?<br> - No, you're saying it.<br> - Are all white people devils?<br> We've gotta move out.<br> We've got a plane to catch.<br> Excuse me, Mr. X?<br> I've read some of your speeches...<br> ...and I honestly believe that a lot<br> of what you have to say is true.<br> I'm a good person in spite<br> of what my ancestors did.<br> I just wanted to ask you...<br> ...what can a white person<br> like me, who isn't prejudiced...<br> ...what can I do to help you<br> and further your cause?<br> Nothing.<br> My high school was a black ghetto...<br> ...in Roxbury, right here in Boston.<br> I got my college education on<br> the streets of Harlem in New York City.<br> I took my master's degree in prison...<br> ...over six and a half years.<br> In fact...<br> ...my old burglary hangout<br> was just outside this campus.<br> I lived like an animal.<br> I stole.<br> I used drugs.<br> I smoked reefers, cocaine.<br> I committed adultery. Had it not been<br> for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...<br> ...l'd have surely been in<br> an insane asylum or dead...<br> ...or possibly even a murderer<br> of one of you.<br> So what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do?<br> He's trying to get us on God's side...<br> ...so that God will be on our side<br> and help us fight our battles.<br> When the so-called Negro in America<br> gets on God's side...<br> ...and listens to the teachings<br> of Elijah Muhammad...<br> ...he'll want to get off of drugs<br> and get away from a life of crime.<br> He'll want to get away<br> from committing adultery.<br> Then he'd want to get off welfare.<br> He'd want a job...<br> ...to take care of his family.<br> And his family would respect him.<br> His son will say,<br> "I'm proud that that's my father."<br> His wife will say,<br> "I'm proud that that's my husband."<br> "Father" only means that you take care<br> of your children. That's what it is.<br> "Father" doesn't mean<br> that you're having some babies.<br> That doesn't make you a father.<br> Anybody can go out and get a woman.<br> But not anybody can take care<br> of that woman.<br> There's another word for it.<br> It's called responsibility.<br> If the so-called Negro in America<br> was truly an American citizen...<br> ...we wouldn't have a racial problem.<br> If the Emancipation Proclamation<br> was authentic...<br> ...if the 13th, 14th and 15th<br> amendments...<br> ...were authentic,<br> we wouldn't have a race problem.<br> If the Supreme Court desegregation<br> decision were authentic...<br> ...we wouldn't have a race problem.<br> But you have to see<br> that all of this is hypocrisy.<br> These Negro leaders are telling<br> the white man...<br> ...that everything's all right,<br> we got it under control.<br> That everything Elijah Muhammad<br> teaches is wrong.<br> Mr. Muhammad said these things<br> were gonna come to pass...<br> ...and now they're coming to pass.<br> Now these same Negro leaders...<br> ...are running around talking about<br> there's about to be a racial explosion.<br> Yes, there's gonna be<br> a racial explosion.<br> And a racial explosion is<br> more dangerous than an atomic explosion.<br> There's going to be an explosion because<br> black people are dissatisfied...<br> ...not only with the white man, but with<br> these Uncle Tom Negro leaders...<br> ...that try to pose<br> as spokesmen...<br> ...for you and I.<br> Just like you have a...<br> Just like you have a powder keg.<br> When you have a powder keg<br> and there's too many sparks...<br> ...the thing's going to explode.<br> If the thing that's going to explode<br> is sitting inside the house...<br> ...and if it explodes, then the house<br> is going to be destroyed.<br> I said the house is going<br> to be destroyed.<br> The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is<br> teaching you and I...<br> ...and trying to tell the white man<br> to get this powder keg out of his house.<br> Let the black man separate<br> from his house.<br> Let the black man have his own house.<br> Let the black man have<br> his own land and property.<br> The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is<br> trying to tell the white man...<br> ...that this thing, this explosion, is<br> gonna bring down his house.<br> This is what he's telling him.<br> More importantly, he's telling him...<br> ...that if he doesn't do<br> something about it...<br> ...if he doesn't do something about it,<br> it's gonna explode any day now.<br> I'm just here to tell you,<br> and I'm gonna make it very short.<br> I'm here to tell you about<br> Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.<br> His greatest greatness is<br> that he has the only solution...<br> ...for peace in this country.<br> The Honorable Elijah Muhammad's<br> solution...<br> ...is the only solution for you and I.<br> It's the only solution<br> for the white man.<br> Complete separation...<br> ...between the black race<br> and the white race.<br> It's the only solution.<br> All praise due to Allah<br> for Elijah Muhammad!<br> All praise due to Allah<br> for Elijah Muhammad!<br> Brother Malcolm!<br> Yes, yes. Hold on, hold on.<br> Yes, sir. It's all right.<br> My brother. How you doing?<br> - Can I ask you something?<br> - Anything.<br> Are you Elijah's pimp?<br> He should be killed<br> for talking like that!<br> What are you saying, brother?<br> "His greatest greatness."<br> Just say what you're saying.<br> If you don't know...<br> ...I feel the sorriest for you.<br> Oh, come on, brother.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> It's all right.<br> He's just hungry for knowledge,<br> that's all.<br> Yeah, that brother's starving.<br> So am I. Come on,<br> let's get something to eat.<br> We'll talk about it tomorrow.<br> - Okay, night-night, Daddy.<br> - Night-night.<br> Long night.<br> - What you looking at?<br> - You.<br> Why you looking like that?<br> You're in trouble.<br> How do you know?<br> Oh, dear heart.<br> Because I know you.<br> Well, if you know me...<br> ...you know I don't like to bring<br> my troubles home.<br> You know that also.<br> Yes, I do.<br> But I'm not made of glass.<br> And I won't break.<br> Look, Betty, I just want peace.<br> I want to sit here with you.<br> I want to...<br> ...be still. I want peace in my house.<br> - Have we ever had a fight?<br> - Never.<br> - Argument?<br> - Never had one, no.<br> We're gonna have one...<br> ...if you don't talk about it.<br> - Talk about what?<br> - The talk's everywhere.<br> - There's always gonna be talk.<br> Aren't they talking now about me trying<br> to take over the Nation?<br> Aren't they talking about<br> how we're getting rich...<br> ...off the Nation of Islam?<br> - We could talk about that too.<br> - Let's talk about it.<br> It's not just talk anymore.<br> "UPl: Elijah Muhammad, 67...<br> ...leader of<br> the Black Muslim movement...<br> ...today faced paternity suits<br> from two former secretaries."<br> These are slanders. These are lies.<br> Don't you know that?<br> Don't you realize this is<br> the devil's newspaper?<br> He's trying to divide us.<br> Divide and conquer. He's trying<br> to bring down our leader.<br> "Both women...<br> ...in their 20s, charge that<br> they had intimacy..."<br> "Intimacies with Mr. Muhammad..."<br> You think I'm not<br> aware of these accusations?<br> You think I'm not<br> aware of these vicious lies?<br> - Brother Baines and I discussed it today.<br> - Baines?<br> Is he your friend?<br> What's wrong?<br> Nothing.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Wake up! Are you so committed that<br> you've blinded yourself?<br> You're so dedicated,<br> you can't face the truth?<br> Baines?<br> He's the editor of the newspaper<br> that you established.<br> Ask him why your name hasn't<br> appeared in it for over a year.<br> - I'm not interested in publicity.<br> - You're in every other paper.<br> Our people know what I'm doing.<br> - But do you know what Baines is doing?<br> - Baines!
