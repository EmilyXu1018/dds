                        I'll take that now, sir. Thank you.<br> - There you are, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's the heater switch.<br> - You told me that last week.<br> - You didn't leave it long enough.<br> - Work on it now.<br> - You got an appointment?<br> - What are you, a doctor?<br> The bakery workers' strike continues<br> with no bread for a week.<br> Unseasonable temperatures<br> for New York...<br> Gotta change... Come on, start.<br> - ...with a humidity of 79%.<br> - Damn.<br> I've gotta make an appointment?<br> - Get away from there!<br> - Get out of here!<br> What are you going to do?<br> Move that crate!<br> Will you move that heap!<br> - I'm talking to you, mister! Move!<br> - All right...<br> You're a menace! Do you know that,<br> you senile old cocker?<br> Don't you tell me to "langsamer",<br> you Kraut meathead!<br> - Langsamer!<br> - Go on!<br> You Limburger-loving schmuck!<br> Jude! You are a Jude!<br> You Nazi bastard!<br> Go on! Get going,<br> you Mercedes bastard!<br> Get going! How do you like that?<br> Come on!<br> Dammit!<br> Come on!<br> How do you like that?<br> Hey! You maniac, you!<br> Go on, you son of a bitch!<br> Come on! Come on back!<br> You anti-Semitic bastard, you!<br> Come on back!<br> Behind schedule?<br> Put a leash on that dog!<br> Here comes the Creep.<br> Yo, Melendez.<br> Hey, Creepy! Hey, Twinkletoes!<br> Creepy!<br> Gonna time yourself in the shower?<br> What was it yesterday? 16.02.<br> I was faster. Shit!<br> ...has shattered the peace<br> of this East Side neighbourhood<br> on this traditional Jewish holiday<br> of Yom Kippur.<br> Two men have been killed<br> in this accident.<br> An explosion and fire,<br> which you see behind me.<br> I'm going to talk to some people<br> to find out what happened.<br> - What were you doing here?<br> - I was taking pictures.<br> - Can you tell me what happened?<br> - "Boom", that's what.<br> One of the men killed here<br> was Klaus Szell,<br> the brother of the infamous Nazi<br> Christian Szell,<br> thought to have perished<br> fleeing Berlin at the end of WWll.<br> Tom Ellis, reporting direct<br> from the scene.<br> - What's this?<br> - They are protesting against pollution.<br> They are a pain in the ass.<br> Janey!<br> London was hectic, but I'm fair.<br> Get a cab and get over here.<br> I've got plenty of room.<br> Oh, screw appearances.<br> I miss you.<br> Just a second.<br> Excuse me, that's not my suit.<br> I don't know what it was about.<br> The valet came into the wrong room.<br> I'm not jittery.<br> Who else knows I'm here?<br> Are you sure?<br> Why don't you finish what you're doing<br> and get your ass over here?<br> - ...in francs is a lot of money.<br> - Is it really?<br> The price is too high.<br> You do speak English?<br> I'd like to offer you half.<br> - Bon apptit, bon apptit.<br> - I guess I didn't do it right.<br> We haven't done anything right<br> on the whole voyage.<br> I'm far too sensitive<br> for this kind of work.<br> Something for your crash diet, LeClerc.<br> - The least I could do.<br> - Merci, Scylla.<br> My diet is going badly.<br> I'm beginning to think I lack willpower.<br> - Why were you surprised to see me?<br> - I wasn't.<br> You were when I came in.<br> Did you think I was dead?<br> That's ridiculous. I expected you<br> three days ago, that's all.<br> London got busy. I'm over here to do<br> a lot of things. You're only one of them.<br> - I haven't got anything for you here.<br> - Why not?<br> Well... I couldn't keep it in the shop.<br> Look... I'll have it for you tonight.<br> - You'll have to come to the opera.<br> - The opera!<br> It's worse than that.<br> It's a very long French opera.<br> You'll have it tonight, won't you?<br> Leave the ticket at the box office.<br> I'll be there before it's over.<br> Plaza Athne.<br> Mike, who you have for English Lit?<br> Bayley? He sucks.<br> - Which room is Biesenthal's?<br> - 107. You were picked for his seminar?<br> You weren't?<br> Ah, Levy. Good of you to come.<br> Won't you join us?<br> Tell us the subject<br> of your dissertation, please?<br> Tyranny, sir. The use of tyranny<br> in American political life.<br> Such as?<br> Maybe...Coolidge breaking up<br> the Boston police strike,<br> Roosevelt putting Japanese-<br> Americans into concentration camps.<br> You might consider<br> the McCarthy business. Hmm?<br> - Sir?<br> - McCarthy.<br> Senator from Wisconsin?<br> Ran a series of purges in the 50s?<br> Yes, I'm aware of that, sir.<br> I was planning a chapter on him.<br> A chapter, I see. Yes, interesting.<br> Well, you four have the dubious honour<br> of having been picked from over<br> 200 applicants for this seminar.<br> There's a shortage of natural resources,<br> breathable air and adequate claret,<br> but there's no shortage of historians.<br> We grind you out like link sausages.<br> It's called progress.<br> Manufactured doctorates<br> is called progress.<br> I say, "Let us hush this cry of progress<br> till 10,000 years have passed."<br> That's a quote. Who said that?<br> Come on. Who said that?<br> Well, somebody<br> must know the answer!<br> Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson.<br> You can't compete on a doctoral level<br> and not know "Locksley Hall".<br> I hope you all flunk! Dismissed.<br> - Levy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come.<br> Sit.<br> I knew your father.<br> Rather well, in point of fact.<br> He was my mentor.<br> I know.<br> - There was another of you.<br> - I have an older brother.<br> A rich successful businessman.<br> My father would have disowned him.<br> Why are you at Columbia<br> for your doctorate?<br> It's not just the way things worked out.<br> You're father got his at Columbia.<br> You can't fill his footsteps,<br> I'm sorry to say.<br> You might end up leaving<br> larger tracks than Dad,<br> but they'll be your tracks,<br> they won't be his.<br> Why didn't you answer that Tennyson<br> question? It was obvious you knew.<br> I... I don't know.<br> How am I to fathom your mind<br> if you continue to hide it from me?<br> If you persist,<br> I'll conclude you're a drone.<br> The McCarthy section<br> is central to your dissertation, yes?<br> The McCarthy section<br> is central to your dissertation, yes?<br> - Yes.<br> - Very worrisome.<br> You wish to write about a period in<br> our history that destroyed your father.<br> But we're talking about<br> an objective doctoral thesis.<br> It mustn't become a hysterical crusade.<br> That's not the way to clear him.<br> All right, you may go.<br> I don't have to worry about clearing him,<br> because he was innocent.<br> - Don't you think he was innocent, sir?<br> - No, I think he was guilty.<br> He was guilty of being arrogant<br> and brilliant and of being nave.<br> Of not being able to cope with<br> the humiliation of being dismissed.<br> But of the charges<br> I know he was innocent.<br> And if it matters, Levy,<br> I wept the day he died.<br> It was a bad day for all of us, sir.<br> Under no circumstances do anything,<br> but call as soon as you...<br> Yes, I have the number. Bye.<br> Bonjour. Commander.<br> We're meeting tonight, right?<br> - At the hotel?<br> - No, make it the Palais Royal.<br> - Same time, then.<br> - I don't know. I'm going to the opera.<br> - You go to the opera? Bye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> There's something going on here<br> that we don't know about.<br> - Can't you be more specific?<br> - Yes.<br> I almost got my ass blown off<br> at the flea market.<br> I'd like to find out by whom and why.<br> Also, LeClerc was not expecting me.<br> You sure you're not overusing<br> your limited imagination?<br> The bomb was not imaginary.<br> Three bombs a day have gone off<br> since the strikes began.<br> - I know that.<br> - Everyone with a grievance is busy.<br> - Am I crazy?<br> - Yeah, you're crazy.<br> - But you'll check it out?<br> - Of course.<br> Why do you need to be reassured?<br> We use you because you're the best.<br> I'm sorry I'm so late.

Boss?<br> No, that's his nickname.<br> William Marcy Tweed.<br> - Marthy...?<br> - I'll write it down for you.<br> They called him Boss, because...<br> ...he was a corrupt politician.<br> He had a bunch of political hacks<br> called The Tweed Ring.<br> This I know. Thank you.<br> - Could I have the pencil, please?<br> - It's mine.<br> Miss Opel!<br> Miss Opel!<br> Miss Opel. Hi. Sorry.<br> You forgot your book.<br> I thought it might be important.<br> - Thank you. Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Your name and address<br> were on the inside of it.<br> In case you were wondering<br> how I knew where you live.<br> I wasn't. Thank you again. Bye.<br> Bye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Bye.<br> You say "good night",<br> but you don't go.<br> I twisted my ankle on the way.<br> I was hoping to rest it.<br> But you're not limping.<br> I'm a marathon runner. When you race<br> 26 miles you don't give in to pain.<br> - It hurts, but I don't pay any attention.<br> - You won at this?<br> I haven't run a whole marathon yet,<br> but I hope to.<br> I wish you good luck. Bye.<br> - I'm sorry I stole your book.<br> - What?<br> I took your book.<br> I didn't know how to talk to you.<br> I was embarrassed,<br> so I took your book.<br> - Aren't you embarrassed now?<br> - Yeah, I'm humiliated.<br> Why do you pursue people<br> who sit at your library table?<br> I don't. It's just that...you're pretty.<br> I can't talk about how smart you are.<br> I don't know you. I'm done lying.<br> Are you always<br> so incompetent with women?<br> - Today is above average for me.<br> - Congratulations. Good night.<br> That's too bad.<br> I could make you so happy.<br> I'm smart as a whip. You won't meet<br> another thief like me in a library.<br> Why don't you say you'll see me?<br> All right. I'll see you again.<br> - But it won't come to anything.<br> - You can't tell.<br> Yes, I can.<br> - How do you say seals in French?<br> - Phoques.<br> So you look at the phoque?<br> How do you spell that?<br> - You don't believe it.<br> - How do you spell it?<br> - F-o-c.<br> - No "k"?<br> - Pigeons.<br> - Pigeons.<br> Pingouin.<br> - lphant.<br> - I like you.<br> I like you, too.<br> Je...vous aime bien.<br> - Merde.<br> - I know.<br> - What's the time?<br> - 11 .47.

I got it from his friends.<br> - Where were those people then?<br> - They were afraid.<br> - You're throwing your life away.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Nothing you write will change that!<br> - Give me the courtesy to read it!<br> It's over! Forget it!<br> Maybe for you.<br> Do you want me to become<br> a corporate hustler like you?<br> - My life's thrown away, anyway.<br> - What do you mean?<br> I'm supposed to be the best<br> in my business.<br> I'm the best because people<br> think I am the best.<br> I'm past it. I know it.<br> Soon it'll become common knowledge.<br> Boy, something has gotten you.<br> Babe...<br> I bet you still have that goddamn gun.<br> Why do you keep it?<br> I don't know.<br> For a liberal pacifist you've got<br> some sense of vengeance.<br> Is Helga as morbid as you?<br> I know you're trying to bait me.<br> You know her name isn't Helga.<br> Or Ursula or Irmgard.<br> - You know what her name is!<br> - All right, all right.<br> Can I take you and Elsa<br> to lunch tomorrow?<br> - But don't eat with your fingers.<br> - I promise.<br> - It's a deal. OK, I get the bed.<br> - Same as always.<br> You have any clean sheets?<br> I think I may have one left.<br> - I really wanted to say that...<br> - What?<br> What?<br> I'm glad to see you.<br> Doc?<br> I'm glad you came down.<br> - When did you last take a subway?<br> - About 1962.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Would you mind putting on this tie?<br> - Why?<br> - It's a rule of the house.<br> - You have to wear a tie here.<br> - I don't have a button.<br> - Put it here. Would you like me to help?<br> - No, I can do it.<br> - Fine. Thank you very much.<br> - What a klutz.<br> - How could you forget a tie?<br> - Who wears a tie for lunch?<br> At least his fly is buttoned.<br> The truffles en croute here<br> are marvellous.<br> And if you get hungry,<br> I'll send the waiter to McDonald's.<br> - Does it look all right?<br> - Perfect.<br> - Number 36, Chablis Grand Cru.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> The great Chablis of the world<br> are almost always green-eyed.<br> In fact, they're the ones<br> that most resemble diamonds.<br> Please, start.<br> Sir.<br> - You approve?<br> - Mmm, too much. It's delicious.<br> It should be. I could pay my tuition<br> for what this meal costs.<br> See the watch he gave me<br> the last time he was here?<br> Nice.<br> Do you miss home? I bet you do.<br> What do you miss most of all?<br> The people? The country? Skiing?<br> - I suppose all.<br> - I'm not that familiar with Switzerland.<br> - What part are you from?<br> - A tiny place. Verbier.<br> - Verbier? I don't believe it!<br> - What?<br> A guy in my office, a ski bum, a pain<br> in the ass about skiing. Excuse me.<br> He's always going on about Verbier.<br> Right at the foot of Mount Rosa?<br> - It's the best skiing in the world. True?<br> - Of course.<br> - Was he a hundred percent right?<br> - Sure.<br> You must know Claude LeSeur.<br> Have you skied with him?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Where is it?<br> - Verbier.<br> - Verbier.<br> I've made all this up. There's no Mount<br> Rosa in Verbier or Claude LeSeur.<br> You're not Swiss. What are you?<br> What are you?<br> - Can't you guess?<br> - Sure. German.<br> - Anything else?<br> - How long are your papers good for?<br> Wait. If this is a joke, it's not funny.<br> I don't need work papers.<br> I'm a student here.<br> Many foreigners marry Americans<br> to make things legal.<br> - Then the marriages don't work out.<br> - Is that what you think of me?<br> - Stop it.<br> - Ask me if I care for him.<br> Why? You haven't told the truth so far.<br> Why don't you ask me if I love him?<br> Why don't you...?<br> Wait a minute. Elsa! Wait!<br> Let her go. She's a phoney. She's<br> after something. Can't you see it?<br> Stay out of it!<br> - You ordered Scylla to be prompt?<br> - Ja.<br> You keep me waiting. Why?<br> To upset me?<br> - Good evening.<br> - I'm not one to be mocked. Behave...<br> Don't give me shit about my behaviour.<br> Not after what you've been pulling.<br> - I've done nothing.<br> - So Chen acted on his own?<br> I don't mind you hiring him,<br> but getting my brother involved?<br> - It was nothing.<br> - It was a violation.<br> We do not involve family, ever.<br> Think of it as a warning. Nothing more.<br> Think of that as a warning<br> and nothing more.<br> You'd like to fight, wouldn't you?<br> It will not happen. I'm much too old<br> and far too smart for that.<br> But we must talk. Truthfully.<br> - Are you to be trusted?<br> - No.<br> Is that the truth, or are you<br> trying again to upset me?<br> - You'll go to the bank sooner or later.<br> - Perhaps I've already been.<br> If so, you wouldn't be here with me.<br> - What else do you know?<br> - I know you're panicking.<br> - You think you'll get robbed.<br> - Who would do that?<br> - Obviously, you think I would.<br> - Well?<br> - Can I trust you?<br> - You never could. You only had to.<br> We're talking of my safety.<br> - May I be candid?<br> - Yes.<br> I couldn't give a fuck about you...<br> Hello? Hi, Elsa. Are you all right?<br> Did you get my note?<br> I've been trying you for two hours.<br> Finally, I just went running.<br> - I'm sorry about your brother.<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> It does!<br> - I don't care. Forget it. It didn't happen.<br> - I wanted to explain.<br> I lied about the Swiss, because...<br> Take it easy, will you? I can't<br> understand. Let me come over.<br> OK? I'll take a shower,<br> I'll be there? Thanks. OK, bye.<br> Doc!<br> - What? What?<br> - Babe...<br> I can't hear.<br> You look at me<br> like I'm doing something wrong,<br> like I did something wrong,<br> I don't understand it.<br> - I don't know anything.<br> - Your name?<br> - I told you my name!<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Thomas Babbington Levy.<br> - You're a student.<br> I come from a family of historians.<br> My card is proof.<br> Please put the papers down.<br> Tell them. Put the papers down!<br> - Take it easy. What's in the papers?<br> - It's a paper I'm writing.<br> - Would you tell me who this is?<br> - It's my father.<br> Where can we contact him?<br> He... He's not alive any more.<br> - Is this yours?<br> - Yes. The licence is in the drawer.<br> I don't know anything. Why ask<br> about this? It has nothing to do with it.<br> OK, enough.<br> - Here.<br> - Thanks.<br> I know this wasn't easy<br> and this is a bad time for you,<br> but it's gotta be done,<br> you can understand that, right?<br> Good evening, sir.<br> - Whoever did it must have set him up.<br> - Get them all out of here.<br> I'll get the ambulance guys.<br> I'm sorry to intrude.<br> I was a friend of your brother's.<br> My name is Peter Janeway.<br> Call me Janey. All my friends do.<br> I'm not your friend.<br> Listen.<br> - I'm anxious as you to find who did this.<br> - I'm a little more anxious.<br> - I think it may have been political.<br> - Political? Why?<br> Considering what your brother did.<br> And your father, of course.<br> - What about my father?<br> - He was H. V. Levy, for Chrissakes.<br> He's been dead for 20 years, and he<br> was innocent. What are you saying?<br> Get off my back!<br> They've been after me for two hours!<br> - I didn't mean to imply...<br> - They told me they were done!<br> What are you saying?!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Come in.<br> Listen...<br> Why don't we begin<br> with what happened tonight?<br> Perhaps you could...<br> give me some of the details.<br> I was here. Doc died. You came.<br> That's it?<br> I'm a demon for details.<br> - You want me to explain, then?<br> - That's right.<br> - Where did your brother live?<br> - In Washington.<br> - What did he do?<br> - Oil business.<br> Wrong. I know exactly<br> how Doc made his living.<br> The closest he got to the oil business<br> was when he filled up with gas.<br> - Tell me what you're talking about.<br> - All right. Follow me.<br> Doc lived in Washington,<br> which is the centre of...?<br> - Government.<br> - Correct.<br> All the branches are competitive.<br> Truth is they're all paranoid schmucks.<br> When the gap gets too large between<br> what the FBI can handle effectively<br> and what the CIA doesn't<br> wanna deal with, we step in.<br> - Who's we?<br> - The Division.<br> - And my brother worked with you?<br> - Yes.<br> You're full of shit.<br> - What do you do exactly?<br> - We provide.<br> - Provide what?<br> - Anything.<br> And you two work together?<br> Why didn't Doc tell me?<br> Why did he lie to me?<br> He was afraid you'd be<br> disappointed in him, I expect.<br> We were very close<br> for many years. Believe me.<br> I know whereof I speak.<br> Doc was desperate to get here.<br> Remember anything he said?<br> He said...my name a couple of times.<br> OK, I'm just guessing now, but...<br> ...whoever killed him<br> will probably want to speak to you.<br> - I don't know anything.<br> - They won't know till they talk with you.<br> I'm staying across the park,<br> at The Carlyle,<br> and if you don't mind,<br> I'd like to use you as bait.<br> - Bait.<br> - Yes.<br> - Will they come tonight?<br> - No.<br> I know it's risky, and I don't wanna<br> force you to do it. It's up to you.<br> Tub.<br> All right.<br> All right, I got it. Here it is.<br> Turn it off. All right.<br> Shit. Jesus!<br> Shit.<br> Help!<br> Help! Help! Please!<br> Somebody help me!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Help! Help!<br> Is it safe?<br> - Is it safe?<br> - Are you talking to me?<br> - Is it safe?<br> - Is what safe?<br> - Is it safe?<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> I can't tell you<br> if something is safe or not<br> unless I know specifically<br> what you're talking about.<br> Is it safe?<br> Tell me what the "it" refers to.<br> Is it safe?<br> Yes, it's safe. It's very safe.<br> So safe you wouldn't believe it.<br> Is it safe?<br> No, it's not safe.<br> It's very dangerous. Be careful.<br> Relax, relax. Come on. Open.<br> Open. It's OK.<br> That hurt? I should think it would.<br> You should take better care of your<br> teeth. You have quite a cavity here.<br> - Is it safe?<br> - I told you I can't tell you...<br> - Think he knows?<br> - Of course. He's being very stubborn.<br> No, please. Please don't. No.<br> It's OK.<br> Is it not remarkable?<br> Simple oil of cloves<br> and how amazing the results.<br> Life can be that simple;<br> relief - discomfort.<br> Now, which of these I next apply,<br> that decision is in your hands, so...<br> ...take your time and tell me.<br> - Is it safe?<br> - Please...<br> Please stop.<br> - Take him.<br> - I got him.<br> More.<br> Thank you.<br> More.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Things are coming together.<br> Down, or your head gets blown off.<br> Those two guys I wasted work<br> for Christian Szell. Know that name?<br> - No.<br> - He did experiments at Auschwitz.<br> He was called The White Angel,<br> Der WeiBe Engel, due to his white hair.<br> The wealthiest and most wanted Nazi<br> left alive. He's hiding out in Uruguay.<br> In '45 Szell told Jews in Auschwitz<br> he'd help them escape for a price.<br> He started out with gold, naturally,<br> but went on to diamonds. Heard this?<br> Szell saw the end early.<br> His brother took the diamonds to<br> America, to a safe deposit box in NY.<br> Szell's brother had the key. The only<br> other key Szell kept in Uruguay.<br> If he comes out to use it,<br> he'll expose himself to great risk.<br> Everything went fine<br> till his brother got killed by an oil truck.<br> Why was it natural to start with gold?<br> He took it from the Jews' teeth before<br> he burned them. Szell was a dentist.<br> He's not coming to America,<br> Mr Janeway. He's here.<br> - No. We'd have known it.<br> - The dentist almost killed me.<br> - He kept saying, "Is it safe?"<br> - White hair? Keep your head down!<br> - Did he have white hair?<br> - He was bald.<br> He's shaved his head!<br> He's here, and he's panicked.<br> - Why is he after me?<br> - Your brother was a diamond courier.<br> Szell thinks Doc said something to you<br> before he died. Did he?<br> - You say my brother worked for Szell?<br> - No! He worked for us.<br> Everything we do cuts both ways.<br> Szell ratted on all his buddies.<br> He kept track on all the Nazis.<br> When we wanted to bring one in,<br> we went to Szell.<br> Babe, you gotta do one thing for me,<br> just one thing.<br> - Quit protecting Doc!<br> - I'm not.<br> - He kept alive to say something.<br> - He didn't.<br> He must have. Tell me!<br> - Nothing!<br> - Shit!<br> I thought you killed them.<br> You killed them!<br> You killed them!<br> You killed them!<br> You fucking killed them!<br> You killed my brother!<br> I don't think he knows anything.<br> I think he knows too much.<br> You can afford to think<br> what you wish. I can't.<br> The gun had blanks,<br> the knife a retractable blade.<br> Hardly original, but effective enough.<br> I think you'll agree.<br> I'm told you are a graduate student.<br> Brilliant, yeah?<br> You're an historian,<br> and I am part of history.<br> I should have thought<br> you would have found me interesting.<br> Frankly, I am disappointed<br> in your silence.<br> Why do you have so little accent?<br> I had alexia as a child.<br> Alexia is a disease...<br> I know. It's where you<br> can't understand written speech.<br> Highest marks.<br> At any event, my writing is childish still,<br> but I'm a fanatic<br> about spoken language.<br> I envy you your school days.<br> Enjoy them. It's the last time in your life<br> no one expects anything of you.<br> I know I behaved terribly,<br> but I had to be sure<br> what you knew. You see...<br> I'm positive your brother<br> meant to rob me,<br> when I left the bank with my diamonds.<br> I don't know anything.<br> - Did Scylla plan the robbery alone?<br> - Robbery?<br> - You know the value of diamonds?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Neither do I. Not in today's market.<br> Tomorrow, I must go and find out<br> before I go to the bank.<br> You see...<br> Your brother was incredibly strong.<br> Strength is often inherited.<br> He died in your arms. He travelled far<br> and in great pain to do that.<br> There has to be a reason.<br> - I don't... I don't know anything.<br> - Karl!<br> Please don't worry. I'm not going into<br> that cavity. That nerve's already dying.<br> A live, freshly-cut nerve<br> is infinitely more sensitive,<br> so I'll just drill into a healthy tooth<br> until I reach the pulp.<br> Unless, of course,<br> you can tell me that it's safe.<br> Erhard!<br> He knew nothing. If he'd known,<br> he would have told. Get rid of him.<br> I don't think you've heard the news.<br> - What is that?<br> - Your flight is at 1 .00 tomorrow.<br> - You are a very confident young man.<br> - It's all a front.<br> Just think of me<br> as any young executive on the come.<br> You're uncontrollable.<br> What you offer us is valuable, but it's<br> not worth the chaos you're causing.<br> And if I'm unable to conclude<br> my business by 1 .00?<br> You'll just have to manage that,<br> won't you?<br> As far as we're concerned,<br> Mr Szell, you're a relic.<br> And you're on your way.<br> I find you rather detestable. May I say<br> that without hurting your feelings?<br> Praise from Caesar.<br> I'm just doing my job.<br> I believe in my country.<br> So did we all.<br> Jesus!<br> Come on, unlock it.<br> Get up.<br> Get him!<br> Hey!<br> Stop!<br> - He went around the corner.<br> - Get the fucking car!<br> He's on the north ramp.<br> Come on, for Chrissakes!<br> Run him down! Run him down!<br> What the fuck...!<br> Why are you walking away?<br> You guys are crazy!<br> No, don't slow down. Keep going.<br> You can drop me at the corner.<br> - Do you have a dime for the phone?<br> - What, a dime?<br> Here. Take this<br> and just give me a dime.<br> - Wait. Let me see what you got.<br> - It's a Rolex. My brother's watch.<br> Hey, come on.<br> - Please.<br> - Here is a dime, man.<br> Here's some more change.<br> - Hello?<br> - Elsa.<br> - Babe.<br> - Babe? What's the time?<br> I don't know. About five o'clock.<br> I want you to do something for me,<br> to meet me.<br> - Where?<br> - 5 1st and Broadway.<br> - I can't.<br> - There's an all-night drugstore.<br> - Why? Tell me what...<br> - Just get hold of a car.<br> - Please. In an hour.<br> - But why?<br> - I'll tell you later. 5 1st and Broadway.<br> - 5 1st and Broadway.<br> Bye.<br> Mrs Melendez, I have to see<br> your son. It's important.<br> I'll cut your finger off<br> if you don't let go of that buzzer!<br> Melendez, it's me.<br> I want you to do a job for me.<br> One more time and I'm coming down<br> with the butcher knife!<br> Please. I'm from across the street.<br> I want you to do something for me.<br> - Who is this?<br> - It's Tom Levy from across the street.<br> - Who the fuck is this?!<br> - Tom... Creepy. It's the Creep.<br> - Creepy?<br> - Open up.<br> - What happened to you?<br> - Come here.<br> Listen, man, it's past my bedtime.<br> - I want you to rob my apartment.<br> - Why?<br> Some guys are after me. I got a gun in<br> my desk. And get me some clothes.<br> - What's in it for me?<br> - I got a TV set. I got a hi-fi.<br> You can take it all. Do it.<br> - What's the catch?<br> - The catch is it's dangerous.<br> - Please do it.<br> - That ain't the catch - it's the fun.<br> Come on.<br> All right, guys. Let's go.<br> Move out of there.<br> Blow it out your ass, motherfucker.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, Elsa.<br> - How...? Babe, what's happened?<br> - God, I'm glad you're here.<br> - What's happened to you?<br> - I'll tell you later. Let's go.<br> You like it?<br> I must get the key.<br> - How did you find this place?<br> - I hope the key is here.<br> - How did you find it?<br> - A girlfriend in my building.<br> It belongs to her family.<br> Is it Szell's?<br> Szell's?<br> Is it Szell's?<br> You're very tired.<br> Where is Janeway?<br> Huh?<br> - What do you do for Szell?<br> - Babe...<br> - What?<br> - I'm sorry...<br> Tell me when they're coming.<br> What did you do for him?<br> - Let me explain.<br> - Explain it.<br> - Explain my brother! Say it!<br> - Please. Stop it!<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> Tell me when they're coming.<br> I don't know, Babe. I...<br> Soon.<br> Good.<br> Thanks.<br> - When did you know?<br> - I didn't...<br> ...till now.<br> - Whose house is this?<br> - Szell's brother's.<br> No, Babe. There's nobody here.<br> Let's go.<br> Please, Babe. Let's go. We still<br> have time. I can get you out of here.<br> So that was Szell.<br> - What's keeping them?<br> - I don't know.<br> What were you?<br> Were you Szell's mistress?<br> - Tell me.<br> - No. I was a courier. Nothing more.<br> I took money from Paris<br> into Uruguay, that's all.<br> I never even met him.<br> God, you are pretty.<br> Where is he? Where is Szell?<br> - Where is Szell?!<br> - It's a lovely morning.<br> Hold it!<br> We're awaiting further instructions.<br> Do we take three giant steps or what?<br> Cops will be here soon.<br> You know, I don't think<br> the police are coming.<br> Neither do l, but I could be wrong.<br> We can work out what you wanna<br> work out, but shouldn't we do it inside?<br> OK. One at a time.<br> No! Over here. Over here.<br> Sit. Sit!<br> You should realise we're only<br> authorised to go to certain limits.<br> Cut the bullshit. Tell me where Szell is.<br> Why did you let us get so close?<br> - You're all in my killing range now.<br> - Taken target practice, have you?<br> A wizard at hitting paper?<br> It's not the same with flesh.<br> - Smashing bone is different...<br> - I wanna know where...<br> Hey.<br> ...Szell is.<br> If the police were coming,<br> you wouldn't be so panicky.<br> - They're coming.<br> - Somehow I don't believe that.<br> Turn it on.<br> Easy. Easy.<br> We're all gonna take it easy.<br> Isn't that right, Erhard?<br> We're all just gonna sit here<br> and wait for the police. Right, Karl?<br> Where is he?<br> Elsa, why don't you move away,<br> give the boy some room to breathe?<br> No!<br> - Drop it! Get it down!<br> - All right, it's down!<br> I didn't want this to happen,<br> but I couldn't trust them.<br> I'll give you Szell for your brother.<br> He's at a bank at 58th and Madison.<br> Go.<br> Go!<br> Babe!<br> - What are you looking for, sir?<br> - Anything we can show you today?<br> Morning, sir.<br> Anything I could interest you in today?<br> We heard that you were not there,<br> but I wouldn't say it was relevant.<br> I can't give you that much.<br> That much I don't make.<br> - OK. Maybe we can make a trade.<br> - No trade, I want cash for the ring.<br> If you want cash, I'll give you cash.<br> Let me take a look at it.<br> - I'd like to see a three-carat diamond.<br> - Why?<br> If you just wanna see,<br> go window-shop.<br> - I was interested in...<br> - First there's gotta be trust.<br> So I'll get this three-carat stone.<br> We'll take it to this<br> independent appraiser I know.<br> If he doesn't swear<br> I'm practically giving this stone away,<br> I just have to get myself<br> a new brother-in-law.<br> I'm gonna do you a big favour.<br> - Can't you just tell me what it's worth?<br> - I'm no high-pressure artist. I sell value.<br> You never answer me!<br> I'm only interested in gem quality.<br> - Around the size of my little fingernail.<br> - You're talking six carat, sir.<br> - More probably.<br> - Would that be prohibitive?<br> - 15,000.<br> - 15...<br> Per carat, naturally.<br> - Naturally.<br> - I know you.<br> Perhaps you do.<br> I'm pretty good at faces myself.<br> - I know this man.<br> - Christopher Hesse. How do you do?<br> Christopher Hesse. How do you do?<br> Wait, let me think...<br> I think... Surely, you came<br> to our antique shop in London?<br> - No, that wasn't it.<br> - No? But you've been to London?<br> - But I don't think...<br> - Hesse of Golders Green, since '33,<br> when we got out of Germany.<br> - Our shop is quite fashionable now.<br> - I always wanted to visit London.<br> I suggest you hurry<br> while it's still there.<br> I thank you for your time. I'm sorry.<br> 90,000 is far too high for me.<br> Our little shop isn't that fashionable.<br> Thank you.<br> I know that man. It can't be...<br> ...Szell? Szell. Szell!<br> Szell! Szell!<br> My God! Stop him!<br> Szell! Stop Szell!<br> It's Szell. Der WeiBe Engel!<br> Der WeiBe Engel is here.<br> Oh, my God. Stop him.<br> Stop him! Der WeiBe Engel!<br> Der WeiBe Engel.<br> He has to be stopped.<br> My God! He gets away.<br> Der WeiBe Engel is here!<br> Szell. Stop him! Oh, please help me.<br> He's a beast.<br> He's a murderer. You must stop him.<br> Oh, my God, there he goes!<br> - He's getting away!<br> - She's crazy.<br> Der WeiBe Engel is here!<br> Stop him! Stop him!<br> I will stop him! I will stop him!<br> The beast! The beast!<br> Szell!<br> I know who you are, you murderer.<br> I know who you are!<br> Help! Help!<br> The man needs help here!<br> Help! Quick! A doctor! Quick!<br> 58th Street and Madison.<br> - Morning, sir. Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Two-five-nine-six-six.<br> All finished, Henry. Thank you.<br> - Everything all right, Mrs Rosenheim?<br> - Oh, yes. See you next week.<br> There you are, sir.<br> Close the door for the light, sir.<br> No one can enter.<br> Everything all right, sir?<br> Yeah...!<br> Yes!<br> It isn't safe.<br> Move.<br> They're all dead. Move.<br> - You'd be foolish to do anything hasty.<br> - Move.<br> - I have things in my possession...<br> - Just keep moving.<br> Name is Arnie, walks with a limp,<br> green jacket, brown pants.<br> Ten-four.<br> - What are you guys doing in here?<br> - We'll just be a little while.<br> - There's nobody allowed in here.<br> - Well, get out! Get out!<br> Hurry up!<br> OK, let's see what you got.<br> If you will just give me a chance<br> to get this open.<br> That's OK.
