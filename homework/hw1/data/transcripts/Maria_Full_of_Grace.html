                        See you later, honey.<br> We still need 40 dozens, standard.<br> No more uncuts. That's enough.<br> So, Blanca, did you see him?<br> I waited by the plaza but he never came.<br> -How long did you wait?<br> -Don't laugh.<br> I'm not laughing.<br> Tell me how long you waited.<br> I didn't really like him anyway.<br> In any case...<br> check out that guy over there.<br> He looks at me and smiles like that<br> all the time.<br> Maria...<br> you want to go to your house?<br> No, Juan.<br> Where do you want to go then?<br> I don't know. Somewhere else.<br> Where?<br> How about up there?<br> The roof? Why there?<br> Why not?<br> Come on.<br> It's not even that high.<br> No.<br> What are you, crazy?<br> See how you treat me, Juan? You're a drag.<br> Let's not get started with this, okay?<br> If I go up, will you follow me?<br> Then what?<br> Are we gonna do it up there?<br> Come down and we'll go to your house.<br> Come down.<br> Come on. It's your turn.<br> No way.<br> Come up. I have to tell you something.<br> You know what, I'm gonna take off.<br> Then go. I'm not moving.<br> You can come down the way you went up.<br> Alone. See ya.<br> I'm really worried. He's constipated.<br> What are you doing?<br> He hasn't shit in two days.<br> Diana, relax. He'll go when he goes.<br> Don't bother him.<br> Maria, don't comb your hair<br> in the dining room.<br> Diana, he's cranky because<br> you're kneading his stomach...<br> Iike a ball of dough.<br> Come here, Pachito.<br> You're scaring him, Maria.<br> Diana, pass him to me.<br> Come, sit down.<br> Mom, will you fix a tea for him?<br> You know those teas don't do anything.<br> Take him to the doctor.<br> No, Grandma, I don't trust that doctor.<br> You don't have to take him anywhere.<br> He's fine.<br> What are you looking for?<br> I'm not sure, Grandma.<br> I don't feel like bread.<br> I said the white ones at 40.<br> What happened?<br> Sir.<br> What's wrong?<br> Can I go to the bathroom?<br> Again?<br> I don't feel well.<br> You're four bins under this hour,<br> and three last hour.<br> How will you catch up<br> if you're in the bathroom all the time?<br> Please, I'll be quick.<br> I have 84 workers in this section...<br> and everyone else puts their head down<br> and does their job.<br> But with you, it's like a constant tug-of-war.<br> At this point I don't know what to--<br> What the hell? What's wrong with you?<br> Look at this mess. This is disgusting.<br> What are you going to do with these now?<br> Tell me. What are you going to do?<br> Pick them up.<br> Take them over there.<br> Hurry up.<br> Clean them.<br> Be careful of the buds.<br> But if they're already ruined.<br> I don't care. Clean them off.<br> I want all those roses clean.<br> And when you're done with that<br> you can go back...<br> and make up what you owe me.<br> Is that clear?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Is everything okay?<br> It's 9,600.<br> Maria, give me the money.<br> -And why should I pay?<br> -It's for Pacho. He started vomiting.<br> Where's your money?<br> Maria.<br> I give up all I make and Diana doesn't<br> put in anything.<br> And I have to pay for the kid's medicine?<br> Don't start with me, Maria.<br> Just give me the money.<br> You can keep the money<br> from your next check.<br> I don't know why everything<br> is so difficult with you.<br> Well, there won't be a next check.<br> Because I quit my job.<br> What?<br> When?<br> Today.<br> But why?<br> They wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.<br> Not once?<br> It's not just that.<br> I don't like how they treat me.<br> So what are you going to do now?<br> You are so stupid, Maria.<br> Why don't you shut up?<br> Don't tell me to shut up.<br> -They treated me like shit.<br> -Why can't you just deal?<br> -Why should I put up with it?<br> -Why don't you think of the family?<br> Quiet! That's enough.<br> -You have to go and apologize to your boss.<br> -I'm not going back.<br> -What are you going to do?<br> -I'll find another job.<br> Another job?<br> There's nothing but flowers here.<br> At least it's a decent job.<br> Please, what's decent about it?<br> Maria, go back and apologize.<br> Aren't you listening?<br> I am not going back.<br> I'm not going back, and that's it.<br> She quit and left him standing there.<br> Well done. This deserves a toast.<br> Bottoms up.<br> Because she kicks ass.<br> Come on. Down the hatch.<br> Blanca, look. Isn't that your boyfriend?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Ask him to dance.<br> No way. You're crazy.<br> Come on, don't be stupid.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> This is Blanca and I'm Maria.<br> I'm Felipe and this is my cousin Franklin.<br> What's up?<br> She wants to dance with you.<br> Go for it.<br> You want to dance?<br> Sure.<br> Let's dance, then.<br> Juan, I want to dance.<br> Hold on.<br> Hold this for me.<br> All right, let's go.<br> Spin, spin, spin.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> What?<br> Another drink.<br> Hey.<br> You want to dance?<br> What do you say?<br> Okay.<br> Let's go.<br> Juan.<br> Hold on.<br> Maria, I'll see you later.<br> Bye, Blanca.<br> All right, then.<br> Juan, I have something to tell you.<br> What is it?<br> I think I'm pregnant.<br> Are you sure?<br> -You're not fucking with me, right?<br> -No.<br> I've missed my last two periods.<br> What are you going to do?<br> I don't know.<br> Who else knows?<br> Only you.<br> No one else?<br> You want everyone to know?<br> I bet Blanca already knows.<br> No, Blanca doesn't know.<br> Maria.<br> Do you want to get married?<br> -Are you joking?<br> -Why?<br> -Where would we live?<br> -My house.<br> There're ten people in your house.<br> You share a bedroom with your brother.<br> So where do you want to live?<br> My house would be better.<br> Right, a lot better.<br> A guy living in his girl's house. No way.<br> You're so fucking stupid.<br> Stupid? Your family hates me.<br> Why should I live there?<br> We're better off in my house.<br> The more the merrier.<br> Why don't you want to get married?<br> I'm stepping up to this.<br> Juan, do you love me?<br> Oh, not that again.<br> Look me in the eye and tell me<br> you really love me.<br> What kind of person are you?<br> You're gonna marry someone<br> you don't even love?<br> Someone who doesn't love you?<br> How many months or days<br> before you're sleeping with another woman?<br> That's not gonna happen.<br> I don't want to end up like my sister.<br> Sorry, but your sister was an idiot<br> who screwed the first guy that walked by.<br> -Shut up.<br> -It's true. And now she's stuck with a kid.<br> Don't talk about my sister like that.<br> Maria, I am not going anywhere<br> and you know it.<br> That doesn't matter. I am not marrying you.<br> Sorry to break it to you, but you'll have to.<br> No, Juan.<br> I don't have to do anything.<br> That's the way you are, Maria.<br> You are so stubborn.<br> You're an idiot, and a loser.<br> Most guys would've left by now.<br> I don't know why I stand you.<br> Then don't.<br> I'm not in love with you.<br> Me neither.<br> Perfect.<br> What's up?<br> How are you?<br> Where are you going?<br> To Bogota.<br> Hop on. I'll give you a ride.<br> To Bogota?<br> Of course, I'll take you.<br> I like the way you dance.<br> Really?<br> You, too.<br> I didn't think people could dance around<br> here. Thought they were all stiff.<br> Where are you from?<br> I'm from a little town.<br> Santa Rosa de Cabal.<br> About ten minutes from Pereira.<br> You know it?<br> No.<br> There are some great hot springs over there.<br> Someday I'll take you there.<br> Yeah?<br> What are you going to Bogota for?<br> I'm going because...<br> I have a friend who works there.<br> She works for a wealthy family,<br> in their house. She's going to help me out.<br> -Don't laugh.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> It's just that...<br> you're way too pretty to be working<br> as a maid.<br> Too cute to get dressed up<br> in that hat and apron.<br> Anyway, I was just going to check it out.<br> Nothing was certain.<br> Listen.<br> If you're looking for work<br> I might be able to hook you up.<br> Hook me up?<br> It involves traveling.<br> Traveling?<br> Tell me.<br> Working as a mule.<br> It's a cool job.<br> You go, hand off the stuff, get your cash<br> and that's it.<br> Everything's cool.<br> What about the people on the news?<br> The ones in prisons far away.<br> What about them?<br> They're the ones who want to be famous.<br> They get caught, get on TV, everyone sees<br> them, and they become famous.<br> I don't want to be famous.<br> I know a guy who can set it all up.<br> Takes care of the papers,<br> makes the arrangements.<br> Know what? Forget it.<br> Let's go.<br> No, hold on.<br> How much would I get?<br> You want something to drink?<br> Give me a beer and a soda for her.<br> I'm going to talk to this guy.<br> I'll be right back.<br> You're all right?<br> All set.<br> Let's go.<br> Come in. Sit down.<br> So you and Franklin are friends.<br> How do you two know each other?<br> She's a friend of the family.<br> Through my cousin.<br> Your cousin.<br> You're looking for work?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Where were you working?<br> In a flower plantation.<br> And what happened?<br> I didn't get along with my boss...<br> so I left.<br> Rebellious, then.<br> No.<br> You don't have a problem<br> taking directions?<br> Orders?<br> No, sir.<br> Do you get scared easily?<br> No.<br> How old are you?<br> Eighteen.<br> Boyfriend?<br> No.<br> Yes or no?<br> No.<br> I don't have a boyfriend.<br> All right, then.<br> How's your system?<br> My system?<br> I mean, how's your stomach?<br> Do you have problems with diarrhea?<br> Constipation?<br> Digestive problems?<br> None. No, sir.<br> Big eater?<br> Normal.<br> Okay, then...<br> we are going to give you several rolls<br> of film.<br> We'll send you to New York.<br> Actually, to New Jersey,<br> a small town next to New York.<br> Once you go though customs...<br> you'll be met by our people.<br> They will take you to a safe place.<br> We'll develop the rolls.<br> And in five or ten days you'll be back here...<br> with all your money taking care<br> of your problems.<br> How much do I get?<br> We'll give you $100 per roll.<br> Keep in mind...<br> we have to take care of your documents.<br> Meaning that after we deduct the expenses<br> for the passport and visa...<br> and for your papers...<br> you'll have seven or eight million pesos.<br> What if I get caught?<br> And why would that happen?<br> Unless you step off the plane<br> shaking like a leaf.<br> Then they'll catch you.<br> Obviously.<br> But no worries.<br> Those gringos don't know a thing.<br> Don't worry.<br> Now...<br> once your decision is made...<br> there is no turning back.<br> You can't tell anyone. Understand?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Now, I know you have a lot of problems<br> weighing on you...<br> and you're in a difficult situation...<br> and I don't want you making this decision...<br> under that kind of pressure.<br> So I'm going to give you this...<br> so you can take care of some things.<br> Actually, it's really not necessary.<br> Thank you.<br> No, no, no. Take it. No obligations.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> You were in the bar, right?<br> My name is Maria.<br> I'm Lucy.<br> Do you work for Javier?<br> Is it hard?<br> It's not easy, but it's not too difficult either.<br> How old are you?<br> Seventeen.<br> But I said I was eighteen.<br> You just have to be prepared<br> and know how to do it right.<br> Where have you been?<br> I went to the city...<br> to ask Jessica for help finding a job.<br> What did she say?<br> It's none of your business.<br> Don't tell me it's not my business.<br> It's not.<br> You didn't find anything.<br> Or you would've said so.<br> You have to go back to the plantation<br> and get your job back.<br> No.<br> It's not fair to Mom.<br> You know how hard it is for her.<br> Now you're making things harder?<br> Get off my back.<br> Don't even.... Pacho had<br> a 108 fever this morning.<br> He's your son.<br> -I know he's my son. So?<br> -He's your responsibility.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> You have to find a job.<br> Well, I got one.<br> Yeah, like what? Cut the shit.<br> At least I put in my share.<br> Take this.<br> Hold it in your mouth.<br> Let it slide to the back.<br> All the way.<br> Open your throat.<br> Now swallow.<br> Practice with these.<br> Can you swallow these?<br> You can't eat anything for 24 hours<br> before the flight.<br> Your stomach has to be totally empty.<br> They may lie about how many you have<br> to swallow.<br> How many will it be?<br> For your size,<br> maybe 60 or 70 pellets.<br> Really?<br> Be glad you're small.<br> Big guys have to swallow...<br> Iike a hundred.<br> Make sure they're well wrapped.<br> If just one opens up you'll die.<br> Wear nice clothes.<br> Nothing flashy. You don't want to look like<br> a peasant showing off.<br> How many times have you done this?<br> Two.<br> How'd it go?<br> Still here.<br> The first time I did it I was gonna go see<br> my older sister.<br> She lives in New York and I haven't seen her<br> in four years.<br> But when I got there I realized...<br> I didn't know what to tell her.<br> How was I going to explain why I was there?<br> And how?<br> I love her.<br> But we're really different.<br> She'd kill me if she found out<br> I was mixed up in this.<br> The second time around...<br> I made it to her house.<br> But I couldn't knock on her door.<br> What is America like?<br> Over there...<br> it's, like, too perfect.<br> Everything's straight.<br> So...<br> how's that thing going?<br> What thing?<br> Your job. Tell me what you have to do.<br> I told you not to talk about it.<br> I talked to Franklin.<br> I'm going to be a mule, too.<br> You did what?<br> You heard me. Why not?<br> Because you can't.<br> Yes, I can.<br> What are you thinking?<br> It's $5,000.<br> You know how much that is in pesos?<br> I figured it out.<br> It's like 10 million pesos.<br> I can buy my family a house with that.<br> No, Blanca, you're not going.<br> You know what? I can do what I want.<br> I don't need your permission.<br> Do you know what you're saying?<br> You have to tell them you're not doing it.<br> No.<br> Anyway, I can't now.<br> I already said yes.<br> All the way to Chiquinquira?<br> But you don't know anything about working<br> in an office.<br> You don't think I'm smart enough?<br> That's not what I said.<br> I don't understand why you have to go<br> so far away.<br> What's up?<br> What's up?<br> -How are you?<br> -All good.<br> And Blanca?<br> She's in another place.<br> Don't worry, baby.<br> Everything's gonna be all right.<br> Give her a hand.<br> These will slow your digestion.<br> Take them.<br> Open your mouth.

A secretary?<br> And you're always talking bad about her.<br> She's always talking about the two of you.<br> She wants to come and visit.<br> Really?<br> And she didn't send anything with you?<br> A letter, a photo or something?<br> Actually...<br> the truth is...<br> Lucy gave me your name and address...<br> and she said that you're really nice,<br> and that...<br> if I had any trouble I could come...<br> and talk to you.<br> I don't have a place to stay.<br> How long have you been here?<br> Two days.<br> Where were you staying these two days?<br> Well.... I was staying with a friend...<br> but we got into a fight and...<br> she kicked me out.<br> And you don't have anyone else here?<br> Family, friends? Nobody?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Do you have a job yet?<br> No, not yet.<br> And how did you say you knew Lucy?<br> Carla.<br> It's not like I'm gonna throw her out<br> on the street.<br> It's just that this apartment is very small.<br> We sleep in the bedroom,<br> and Pablo's cousin here in the living room.<br> Honestly...<br> I don't need a lot of space.<br> Yes, but for how long?<br> Only for a few days.<br> And then what?<br> I'll find something.

Where did you go?<br> I met a woman who gave me a place....<br> You know each other?<br> Is that Lucy's sister?<br> You know Lucy?<br> Yes.<br> What do you mean?<br> You said you didn't know anyone else here.<br> The thing is.... I told her about Lucy<br> on the way here.<br> So...<br> you're not really a friend of hers.<br> It's just that Maria said that she was going<br> to stay with you and...<br> I don't have a place to stay.<br> You, too?<br> I don't understand.<br> Everyone knows someone here.<br> Yes, yes. I'll get the receipt.<br> I'll come up with something. Don't worry.<br> Tell them to fix this, and not to charge you...<br> since they did it wrong the first time.<br> -How are you?<br> -Fine.<br> How's the little one?<br> Fine, thank you, Don Fernando.<br> It seems my sister in Colombia sent me<br> a little surprise.<br> Maria and Blanca.<br> Hi.<br> When did they arrive?<br> They just got here,<br> but they don't know anyone.<br> Maybe you know of an apartment...<br> a job or something.<br> Don't you worry. I'll make a couple calls<br> and we'll--<br> Yes, sure...<br> He'll help you. I've got to go to work.<br> You know how to get back.<br> Three blocks down and around the corner.<br> I'll be back tonight to let you in.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm leaving them here. Bye.<br> There's a place that usually needs<br> women to sew.<br> They don't check papers...<br> and they pay minimum wage.<br> Thanks for your help,<br> but we don't need work.<br> What are you doing? We can't go back there.<br> I don't care what you do.<br> I'm sick of following you around.<br> Like I asked you to? I told you not to come.<br> You're the one that wanted to take off<br> before we got paid.<br> Those guys are dangerous.<br> Quiet.<br> What's that you've got there?<br> Nothing.<br> I recognize what those are.<br> I've seen that before.<br> Tell me.<br> Does Carla know about this?<br> Are you all right, physically?<br> Our friend who was with us got sick.<br> I think one of the pellets broke inside her.<br> I don't know if they killed her or if she died.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Where was this?<br> Don Fernando,<br> please help us find our friend.<br> I'll make some calls to the police<br> in New Jersey.<br> They might know something.<br> You can't call the police.<br> Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.<br> You have to return those drugs.<br> Before they hurt your families in Colombia.<br> Do you understand?<br> Blanca.<br> I lost the emergency number.<br> Do you have it?<br> I can't believe what you told him<br> about Lucy.<br> He's calling the cops now.<br> Don't fucking start with me.<br> You were the one pulling out the pellets<br> and running your mouth.<br> You want to sew shirts?<br> -I'm handling this.<br> -Stupidly.<br> Then why are you following me around?<br> Every time I turn around, there you are.<br> I thought you knew what you were doing,<br> but obviously not.<br> I'm not responsible for you.<br> I'm not your fucking mother.<br> I wouldn't want you anyway. I feel sorry for<br> your baby having such a stupid mother.<br> How fucking stupid...<br> swallowing drugs when you're pregnant.<br> Fuck you.<br> -Do you have an appointment?<br> -No.<br> I can give you one for next week.<br> No, it has to be today.<br> If you don't mind waiting,<br> I might get you in...<br> but I can't promise.<br> Thanks.<br> Fill this out.<br> You have to be very careful<br> while you're pregnant.<br> You can't smoke.<br> You can't drink alcohol.<br> No beer, no wine.<br> Especially not drugs.<br> Everything you put in your body<br> goes straight to the baby.<br> If you smoke,<br> it's like giving a cigarette to your baby.<br> Okay?<br> Let's see.<br> At this stage of the pregnancy<br> we can see the entire fetus.<br> That's the head.<br> See?<br> That's my baby?<br> The arms.<br> These are the legs.<br> The blood is flowing well.<br> I'll take some measurements.<br> But everything's okay, right?<br> Yes, everything is okay.<br> Do you want to listen...<br> to the heart?<br> Friday, the eleventh of next month.<br> That's fine.<br> They found the body of a woman yesterday.<br> The stomach had been cut open...<br> and they think it was a mule.<br> They sent this information...<br> with a picture of her face.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Please...<br> I need to know your friend's name.<br> And an address in Colombia.<br> What's her name?<br> Lucy Diaz.<br> Carla's sister?<br> Yes. But Carla doesn't know.<br> She was coming to visit.<br> She has to know.<br> It's her sister.<br> I'm sure the baby will sleep with us<br> in the beginning but...<br> the crib was on sale.<br> What did Don Fernando tell you?<br> He told me that...<br> Carla.<br> I don't really need a job.<br> I'm going back to Colombia.<br> Darling, you're not going back.<br> I know how you feel.<br> I felt the same way when I came here.<br> I remember on my grandma's birthday,<br> I called home...<br> and I could hear my whole family...<br> Iaughing and screaming.<br> My little sister asking, "How is it over there?<br> Is it wonderful?<br> "How's your job?"<br> Telling me how much she wanted to come<br> and stay with me.<br> I just wanted to tell them<br> how much I missed them.<br> But it gets better, trust me.<br> I remember when I got my first paycheck.<br> I'll never forget going to that office<br> to send money home for the first time.<br> You can't imagine how it feels.<br> Your heart feels so big...<br> Iike it won't fit in your chest.<br> The real reason I stay here is for my baby.<br> He'll have so many more opportunities.<br> I can't imagine bringing up my child<br> in Colombia.<br> Not with the situation being what it is.<br> It pains me to say it, but it's true.<br> -I'll get it.<br> -That must be your friend.<br> They found Lucy's body.<br> I saw it in a picture.<br> It'll cost $2,500 to send her body back home.<br> Pablo.<br> Are you done?<br> Yes, love.<br> Hello.<br> It's for you, Carla.<br> How are you, Don Fernando?<br> I'm fine, thank you. Why do you ask?<br> Arrangements?<br> Arrangements for what?<br> No.<br> She didn't say anything.<br> Lucy?<br> What do you mean?<br> Are you sure?<br> Found here?<br> I don't understand. What do you mean?<br> -They came as what?<br> -Carla, please, let me explain.<br> I tried to tell you,<br> but I couldn't get the words out.<br> What are you saying?<br> Lucy got sick.<br> I tried to help her. I swear.<br> But I didn't know what--<br> When were you going to tell me?<br> I talked to Don Fernando.<br> I arranged everything<br> to send Lucy back to Colombia.<br> Arranged?<br> Carla, please.<br> Arranged what?<br> You're not arranging anything.<br> -You keep your hands off my sister.<br> -What's going on?<br> You've done enough!<br> No, you don't understand.<br> What have you done?<br> Fucking little bitches.<br> Carla, listen to me. Please.<br> You were never her friend. Never!<br> -Don't say that. I tried to help her.<br> -Get out now!<br> I tried to help her. I swear.<br> Get out!<br> -Maria, let's go.<br> -Just go, please.<br> -Get them out already!<br> -Forgive me.<br> Get out!<br> Please leave.<br> Get out! Get out!<br> What do you want to do?<br> It's ringing.<br> Hello.<br> This is Maria Alvarez.<br> Yes, she's with me.<br> Where the fuck did you think you<br> were going with the stash?<br> -Bitches!<br> -But, we--<br> But nothing! Where are the fucking pellets?<br> Come on!<br> Let her go.<br> -What about yours?<br> -ln my purse.<br> She should have 50<br> and the other one 62.<br> They're all here.<br> All right, it's all good.<br> What about our money?<br> You think we owe you? After you went<br> running from the hotel?<br> But we called you.<br> You got lucky.<br> I was about to tell Javier<br> that you ran off with the goods.<br> But you have all the pellets.<br> That's right. We have them.<br> We couldn't give a fuck about you.<br> We still need that money.<br> Really?<br> I see. You need the money?<br> You really need the money?<br> Know what?<br> Give it to them.<br> Take it.<br> Come on.<br> Here.<br> Make sure it's all there.<br> When you get back to Colombia,<br> be sure to tell Javier how nice I was.<br> You better not fuck around<br> on your next trip.<br> Got it?<br> You've been trained now.<br> What about Lucy's money?<br> What about it?<br> -I want to give it to her family.<br> -You've got nothing to do with that.<br> You have her pellets.<br> That's none of your business.<br> She died doing this.<br> They found her body.<br> I just want to give her sister the money.<br> No fucking way.<br> She deserves a proper burial.<br> After what you did to her...<br> it's your responsibility.<br> Fuck that. She knew what she was doing.<br> It's not on us.<br> -Of course--<br> -Shut the fuck up, bitch! Get out. Now!<br> And this is so Carla can send Lucy<br> back to Colombia.<br> Okay.<br> If that's what she wants.<br> One minute, please.<br> I'll be back in a minute. Excuse me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to disturb you.<br> I'm going back to Colombia.<br> I just wanted to say goodbye to Lucy.<br> She looks pretty.<br> I don't understand why she never<br> said anything.<br> We grew so far apart.<br> Blanca.<br> THE END<br>
