My stomach feels<br> a little bit sick.<br> Are you feeling better now?<br> Are you feeling better, Camille?<br> - I wonder if our little doggie is sick.<br> - Feel a little sickly.<br> Now.<br> Oh, my goodness, it's so<br> uncomfortable underfoot.<br> Come on.<br> There we are.<br> How is her bosom?<br> I have not looked at the archduchess's<br> bosom, Your Majesty.<br> Oh, didn't you?<br> It's the first thing I look at.<br> The Duc de Choiseul.<br> The foreign minister<br> who was instrumental in this union.<br> I shall never forget that you were<br> responsible for my happiness.<br> And that of France.<br> Please.<br> Here comes the Austrian.<br> I hope you like apple strudel.<br> May I present Madame la Dauphine,<br> Marie Antoinette.<br> My dear grandfather king.<br> Welcome, madame.<br> Let me present my grandson,<br> Louis Auguste.<br> Welcome, madame.<br> She looks like a child.<br> Hello.<br> Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome, madame.<br> Thanks.<br> Hello.<br> Amen.<br> To the dauphin<br> and dauphine of France.<br> May you have many<br> healthy children...<br> ...and produce an heir to our throne.<br> Good luck.<br> And good work.<br> Apparently, nothing happened,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Nothing?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nothing.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Madame...<br> ...at the morning<br> dressing ceremony...<br> ...rights of entry are given<br> to members of the high court.<br> Major rights to princesses of the blood<br> and mistresses of the household...<br> ...while minor rights<br> to the valets and charges.<br> Anyone with rights of entry<br> may enter at any time...<br> ...so you must pay attention to<br> acknowledging properly each arrival.<br> And you must not<br> reach for anything...<br> ...for the handing of an item<br> to the dauphine is a guarded privilege.<br> Must go to the highest rank<br> in the room.<br> For example,<br> the Princesse de Lamballe...<br> ...is a princess of the blood<br> by marriage.<br> Madame.<br> Thank you.<br> - It's cold.<br> - Yes.<br> Good morning.<br> So now the position must go<br> to the Duchess of Char...<br> ...because she is also<br> a princess of the blood.<br> Hello.<br> So now, as a member<br> of the royal family...<br> ...your sister-in-law, the Comtesse de<br> Provence, must have the honor.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> This, madame, is Versailles.<br> So I've heard you make keys<br> as a hobby?<br> Yes.<br> And you enjoy making keys?<br> Obviously.<br> She had to let her servants go.<br> My maid knows the cook.<br> You know everyone.<br> Comtesse de Noailles<br> looks very out of sorts.<br> I think her husband's been<br> causing a little problem lately...<br> ...spending far too much time<br> with his stable boys.<br> Too much.<br> Marie Antoinette looks<br> very pretty tonight.<br> Yes.<br> Darling, a new life, unfortunately.<br> When you think about it,<br> this poor Marie Antoinette.<br> So young, so...<br> I think she should<br> go back to her country.<br> Look at her, so disgusting.<br> The comtesse is looking rather<br> dour this evening, don't you think?<br> Always dour. Always tragic.<br> Can't believe they've brought<br> those ghastly aunts out again.<br> Where have they been<br> hiding them all these years?<br> Oh, really? This is shocking.<br> What is she...?<br> It's so awful, I can't--<br> Oh, my goodness.<br> Who is she?<br> That lady is here<br> to give pleasure to the king.<br> That's du Barry, the king's mistress.<br> She wouldn't be allowed at court...<br> ...but the king did some maneuvering<br> to secure her a title.<br> The one thing I've learned<br> about girls from the gutter...<br> ...is they know their jewels.<br> No way are those fake.<br> You see that?<br> Is this the way<br> people are treating me?<br> To the stocks.<br> Nobody treats me like a lady here.<br> Now she's staring at me.<br> It's so awful.<br> - She should not be sitting at this table.<br> - I'll have one of--<br> Did you hear that?<br> - She just burped.<br> - Out of the whorehouse, darling.<br> - I don't know who you're referring to.<br> - Everyone at this table is for sale.<br> - Curls.<br> - What a little tart.<br> Well, she's not the only one at this<br> table, darling. Take a look around.<br> Look at this beautiful<br> Marie Antoinette. I look like her?<br> - Don't you think so?<br> - A long time ago.<br> Oh, you exaggerate.<br> She has blue eyes like me.<br> I suppose she's rather sweet.<br> For an Austrian.<br> I think she's delightful.<br> She looks like a piece of cake.<br> Be interesting to see<br> how long she lasts.<br> Good afternoon, Your Majesty.<br> How is your grandson, the dauphin?<br> He's off hunting the stag.<br> She doesn't seem<br> the least bit interested in him.<br> She is Austrian. They're not exactly<br> the warmest people.<br> But it's true. Her brother Joseph<br> is so cold. He's an awful man.<br> They say in Austria,<br> that she was with child...<br> What a hunt today.<br> I'm exhausted.<br> Would you like some meat?<br> Your Royal Highness...<br> ...handing out cold meats<br> to a hunting party...<br> ...is not the most becoming conduct<br> for a future queen of France.<br> I was just trying to be a nice wife<br> for the dauphin's hunt.<br> Surely there's no harm in that.<br> And I received a letter from<br> your mother warning you not to ride...<br> ...as this is one of<br> the leading causes of miscarriages.<br> Well, as everyone knows,<br> there's no danger of that.<br> And it's not my fault.<br> Do you realize the consequences of<br> an unconsummated royal marriage?<br> That it could be annulled?<br> Your mother has asked that<br> you take this matter very seriously.<br> And do everything<br> in your power...<br> ...to inspire the dauphin.<br> I'll do what I can.<br> Of course I want to please<br> the dauphin and my mother.<br> You'll have no influence over the king<br> and dauphin without a pregnancy.<br> Madame, you have<br> the alliance to consider.<br> Letting everyone down<br> would be my greatest unhappiness.<br> I am pleased madame<br> is taking this seriously.<br> Oh, is Mops on his way?<br> I'm working on it...<br> ...but Your Royal Highness has<br> more pressing matters to attend to.<br> Oh, and I received this letter<br> from your mother.<br> Dearest Antoinette:<br> It is clear that the heart<br> of your problems in your new home...<br> ...is your inability to inspire<br> sexual passion in your husband.<br> There is no reason a girl<br> with so many charms as you...<br> ...should be in this situation.<br> Remember, you represent<br> the future...<br> ...and nothing is certain<br> about your place there...<br> ...until the final physical act to crown<br> the Franco-Austrian alliance...<br> ...is performed.<br> It's cold.<br> It is a bit chilly.<br> Shall I get you a blanket?<br> No. It's okay.<br> Are those your feet?<br> They're like icicles.<br> Well...<br> ...sleep well.<br> Thank you.<br> - Night.<br> - Good night.<br> Your hair always looks so pretty.<br> - Oh, do you think so?<br> - Yeah, it's gorgeous.<br> - It's not what I'm used to. It is.<br> - It's so nice to be blond.<br> - Have you been to see Lonard?<br> - No.<br> My head is in agony.<br> - This morning, I think, you know--<br> - Did he pull it?<br> Lonard must've been<br> in a bad mood...<br> ...because he was pulling<br> my hair so hard.<br> And I want to tell him, you know, it's<br> not my fault if he's had a bad morning.<br> Don't take it out on my scalp.<br> That was unnecessary.<br> Watch it.<br> I would love to go<br> to the opera in Paris.<br> Why go to the opera when we can<br> listen to the comtesse here?<br> Must she sing all night?<br> Can't you do something<br> about your wife?<br> Madame, shall we retire<br> to make love all night?<br> Four times last night wasn't enough.<br> Dear Antoinette:<br> I am extremely concerned<br> with your situation.<br> Fortunately, the king doesn't show<br> preference for your sister-in-law.<br> But what if she becomes pregnant?<br> Also, I have heard...<br> ...that you are not making<br> invitations to Madame du Barry.<br> Snubbing the king's favorite,<br> in your position...<br> ...is extremely unwise.<br> - Du Barry is dreadful.<br> - Dreadful.<br> The way she dresses.<br> She thinks she is the queen.<br> Yes, she does.<br> And those ridiculous pet monkeys.<br> Where does she come from?<br> From every bed in Paris.<br> You know, we didn't think she'd<br> last long until she married the comte...<br> ...and then he was conveniently<br> shipped away somewhere.<br> She doesn't stay in the boudoir.<br> - She's political.<br> - Very.<br> And extremely anti-Choiseul.<br> And I don't want to say this...<br> ...but I don't think that she has<br> greeted you with respect.<br> That's just my opinion.<br> Ambassador Mercy says<br> I must pay her a visit.<br> Well, if we invited you to tea<br> at the last minute...<br> ...you wouldn't be able to,<br> would you?<br> She died giving birth<br> to her tenth child.<br> What a pity. What a pity.<br> - There was blood all over--<br> - Here comes our little Austrian.<br> - Good afternoon, madame.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Good afternoon. You look lovely.<br> Oh, thank you. So do you.<br> Thank you.<br> Look at du Barry.<br> What is she wearing now?<br> Another one of her exotic fantasies?<br> She can't pass a mirror<br> without seducing it.<br> Do you think she's wearing<br> enough jewelry?<br> Never enough for du Barry.<br> She's coming.<br> Oh, I love your shoes, Victoire.<br> Oh, why, thank you.<br> I got them from Christian in Paris.<br> - Oh, I must call on him.<br> - Yes, you must. He's wonderful.<br> Madame du Barry would like<br> to offer you some diamonds.<br> I have enough diamonds.<br> Snubbing the king's favorite is publicly<br> criticizing the king's behavior.<br> All you need do is say<br> a few words to her.<br> Because of rank she is not<br> allowed to speak first.<br> I certainly have nothing<br> to say to her.<br> Why should I approve of his<br> cavorting with a harlot?<br> - Your Royal Highness.<br> - Well, that's what she is.<br> Everyone knows she's from a brothel<br> and that title was bought for her.<br> Your mother and I<br> are very concerned.<br> Du Barry has been complaining to<br> the king that you will not address her.<br> And you cannot afford<br> to fall out of favor with the king.<br> Especially as your marriage...<br> ...not exactly on solid ground.<br> Fine. I'll talk to her.<br> There are a lot of people<br> at Versailles today.<br> Yes, there are.<br> Those are my last words<br> to that woman.<br> The first mechanical locks<br> were made of wood.<br> Records show them in use<br> some 4000 years ago in Egypt.<br> Any good fans? That one's pretty.<br> - Evening or daytime?<br> - I like lace.<br> These are so du Barry.<br> - Do you like these for hair?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - You don't think it's too much?<br> - Maybe one.<br> - One feather?<br> - Yeah.<br> Or in white?<br> Can we get these in white, maybe?<br> I don't know if I like that one.<br> I love these.<br> Do you want these too?<br> Yeah, but in pink.<br> Oh, okay. Two in pink.<br> Has madame read the brief<br> on our current situation?<br> No, I haven't read it yet.<br> Can you just tell me about it?<br> Well, the reforms in Poland by King<br> Poniatowski have led to civil war.<br> The Russians and the Austrians<br> have taken over a third of Poland...<br> ...which is, of course, distressing...<br> ...as Poland is a friend and ally<br> of France.<br> Which sleeve do you like?<br> With ruffles or without?<br> Have you been paying<br> any attention?<br> Your mother is relying on you<br> to smooth over this crisis.<br> Where will I be if there's a rupture<br> between our two families?<br> Am I to be Austrian<br> or the dauphine of France?<br> You must be both.<br> - Well, I heard that she bought a boy.<br> - No.<br> Yes, I heard. She found a peasant<br> boy by the side of the street...<br> ...and took him in like a stray dog.<br> Well, it's not as if<br> she can have one of her own.<br> Maybe if she spent<br> less time with Lamballe...<br> ...and more time with her husband...<br> ...there wouldn't be a problem.<br> Well, let's not forget<br> she is an Austrian spy.<br> And I can't imagine<br> that's very warm in the bedroom.<br> Come, my little truffle cake.<br> I'm going to ravage you.<br> - Will you come back right away?<br> - Yes, my sweet.<br> Just a quick hunting excursion,<br> we'll be back straightaway.<br> I will be humiliated<br> before the court and the public...<br> ...if your brother's new wife<br> becomes pregnant before I do.<br> When I return from Saint-Cloud,<br> you can be sure...<br> ...that I will resume my regime.<br> And hopefully everything<br> will go swimmingly.<br> I have absolutely no intention of<br> breaking the alliance with Austria.<br> I am very relieved to hear that,<br> Your Majesty.<br> But what on earth is going on<br> with that young couple?<br> It's a disaster.<br> Send for Dr. Lassonne to visit them.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Do you find your body responsive?<br> What?<br> Do you find your body responsive?<br> What do you eat for breakfast?<br> Hot chocolate.<br> Hot chocolate.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Yolande.<br> How lovely to see you.<br> Yes. This is<br> the Duchesse de Polignac.<br> - Hello.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - We haven't seen you for a while.<br> - I know.<br> I've been in St. Petersburg,<br> where I met Dimitri.<br> Isn't he divine?<br> Have you ever been with a Russian?<br> - No, I--<br> - They're so bossy.<br> Look how fat the marquis's gotten.<br> Hope he doesn't break the chair.<br> Is he still sleeping with Camille?<br> Anyway, I must be off.<br> It was lovely to meet you.<br> Quiet.<br> Applause is not usually permitted<br> at court performances.<br> Why not?

Lonard is here<br> to fit your new wigs.<br> All right.<br> I'll get the small trees.<br> And I'll ask Louis for the money<br> for the Young Mothers' Fund.<br> The Americans are asking for help<br> in their revolution.<br> Well, I can't exactly see<br> assisting those...<br> ...who are rejecting their sovereign.<br> But it would make<br> a strong statement to England.<br> Can our finances take the strain?<br> Oh, taxes will be raised slightly.<br> I recommend we help<br> our American brothers...<br> ...and show the rest of Europe<br> our strength.<br> All right, then.<br> Send funds to America.<br> Madame, your brother, the emperor,<br> is in the salon waiting for you.<br> He's here?

She makes me laugh.<br> And your constant parties.<br> I mean, they can hardly leave you<br> enough time to spend...<br> ...alone with your husband.<br> I'm sure our mother has worried you.<br> Yes. Well, of course she has.<br> I think I'm gonna talk to young Louis.<br> Magnificent.<br> We have a female elephant<br> in our Austrian menagerie.<br> Well, perhaps we could arrange<br> a marriage.<br> So...<br> ...I thought we could have a little talk<br> about the marriage bed.<br> The doctor said I was fit.<br> Good.<br> What goes on exactly?<br> I understand you have<br> a certain passion for locks.<br> Yes.<br> Well, sometimes when<br> a key doesn't quite fit...<br> The problem is only that<br> the king and queen of France...<br> ...are complete blunderers.<br> There's nothing really wrong<br> with Louis XVI.<br> Everything works,<br> just not at the right time.<br> I think after our conversation,<br> the great work will be accomplished.<br> Very warm in here.<br> I can't even believe she's getting<br> enough air.<br> Is it a boy?<br> It's a girl, look.<br> She's unconscious.<br> We must get her air.<br> Please, the queen needs air.<br> Excuse me.

Excuse me, Father.<br> We have not received any invitation<br> by the queen...<br> ...which is customary to our rank.<br> I'm afraid the queen is not well<br> enough for formal entertaining...<br> ...but I will speak with her, madame.<br> But--<br> How can we be expected<br> to live in a place...<br> ...without any certainty<br> of our position?<br> I don't understand.<br> The Duchesse de Char<br> was very angry.<br> But this is my escape<br> from all the protocol.<br> Raumont, amongst others,<br> was complaining.<br> Well, we'll invite them to the theater<br> for my first performance.<br> - We'll need an audience.<br> - Splendid.<br> Bravo!<br> Bravo!<br> Bravo!<br> And in the end, I don't know<br> how they go out.<br> - It's always raining there.<br> - Not like here.

The dauphin of France.<br> Hello. Why don't you hit<br> the ball over there?<br> Come on. You're gonna hit it.<br> Your Majesty, the Bastille fortress<br> was stormed by an angry mob.<br> In view of the hatred felt<br> for the Duchesse de Polignac...<br> ...thought to be<br> the queen's favorite...<br> ...I would recommend that<br> she leave for the Swiss border.<br> I also must urge all of the princes<br> and princesses of the blood...<br> ...to leave at once.<br> Yes, they must go. I will stay.<br> Certainly the royal family<br> must find somewhere more secure.<br> Metz is one of the strongest<br> fortresses in Europe.<br> You will not be safe here.<br> I will see to it that<br> my mistresses are off at once...<br> ...but my place is here<br> with my husband.<br> Goodbye.<br> Your Majesty, your immediate<br> return is requested.<br> There's a mob of hundreds...<br> ...on their way in demand<br> of flour from their sovereign.<br> It would be more secure<br> to decamp to Rambouillet...<br> - ...twice the distance from Paris.<br> - I will not be a fugitive king.<br> It is too dangerous here.<br> At least send<br> the queen and children.<br> My place is at the king's side.<br> The first of them<br> have arrived in town.<br> We will stay here.<br> Save the queen, madame.<br> They're coming to kill her.<br> Celine, don't be frightened.<br> Let's get the children.<br> Are you admiring your lime avenue?<br> I'm saying goodbye.<br>
