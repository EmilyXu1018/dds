be more than whether<br> they're good-looking or not.<br> You think you're<br> not so good-looking.<br> My father was an ugly man,<br> but my mother adored him.<br> She used to get<br> miserable sometimes,<br> like everybody<br> and my father always<br> tried to understand.<br> I used to see them<br> sitting in the living room,<br> talking and talking.<br> I used to adore my old man<br>

Stern.<br> He lived down a block.<br> He moved out, though.<br> My old man used to play cards<br> with him and some other old guys.<br> He was a jewish fella.<br> He said,<br> "is your mother home?"<br> I knew there was<br> something wrong.<br> I turned exactly<br> I said,<br> "is something wrong?"<br> I was in my pajamas,<br> you know, so he said,<br> "Marty, your father died."<br> My father died in the<br> middle of playing cards.<br> He had a heart attack.<br> He had low blood pressure.<br> He used to faint a lot.<br> Boy, am I talking!<br> Excuse me. I never<br> talked so much before.<br> Usually everybody<br> tells me their troubles.<br> I'll shut up now<br> and let you talk.<br> Yeah, 17 years ago<br> what I been doing with<br> myself all that time?<br> There I go again.<br> I must be driving you crazy!<br> Most of the time<br> with girls,<br> I can't find a word to say.<br> I'm going to shut up now<br> and let you get a word in.<br> Usually I'm not like this.<br> Usually, l-<br> there I go again.<br> I'm on a jag,<br> for pete's sakes.<br> You'd think I was loaded!<br> Like I started to say-<br> I...<br> I can't stop my mouth!<br> Isn't this stupid?<br> You got a real<br> nice face, you know?<br> Really, a nice face.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, Mac, anything good inside?<br> Oh, a bunch of dogs.<br> Hey, Marty.<br> Marty, you in here?<br> So I'm in<br> a kneeling position.<br> If you try shooting a b.a.r.<br> That way-<br> you know what I mean?<br> I can't hold<br> a steady position.<br> I'm wavering back and forth.<br> So the guy next to me,<br> he's shooting<br> from a prone position,<br> and he's cross-eyed<br> like I told you.<br> So just then-<br> so just then<br> I hear 5 shots go off<br> from the guy next to me.<br> My target goes down.<br> The flag comes up.<br> I got 5 bull's eyes!<br> That's how I got<br> the reputation<br> of being the best shot<br> in the whole battalion.<br> So when I got<br> out of the army,<br> I was lost.<br> I didn't know<br> what I wanted to do.<br> I was 25 years old.<br> I couldn't go back to my<br> old job at 40 cents an hour.<br> I thought I'd go to<br> college under the GI Bill,<br> but my brother Freddie,<br> he wanted to get married,<br> and I had 3 unmarried sisters.<br> In an italian house,<br> that's a terrible thing.<br> So I just went to pieces.<br> I used to walk the streets<br> till 3:00,<br> My poor mother used to be<br> so worried about me.<br> God forgive me<br> what I'm gonna say now,<br> but I used to think<br> of doing away with myself.<br> I used to stand<br> in the subway sometimes,<br> and god forgive me,<br> I used to feel the tracks<br> sucking me<br> down under the wheels.<br> I'm catholic, you know.<br> Even to think about<br> suicide is a terrible sin.<br> Yes, I know.<br> So then mr. Otari,<br> he offered me this job<br> in his butcher shop.<br> Everybody pleaded<br> with me to take it.<br> So that's what happened.<br> I didn't want to be a butcher.<br> There's nothing wrong<br> with being a butcher.<br> Why, it's not<br> an elegant profession.<br> It's in a lower social scale.<br> People look down on butchers.<br> I-I don't<br> the point is, mr. Otari<br> wants to sell his shop<br> because... why,<br> it's a nice little shop.<br> I handle his books for him,<br> so I know he has a 35 markup,<br> which is not unreasonable.<br> Takes home net maybe 100,<br> Of course, you gotta worry<br> about the supermarkets.<br> There's 2 in the neighborhood<br> now and an a&p coming in.<br> Marty, it's my feeling<br> that you really want<br> to buy this shop.<br> Well, that's true.<br> I do.<br> But it means I got to<br> take a loan of $8,000.<br> That's a big note to carry.<br> Marty, I've known you<br> for 3 hours,<br> but I know<br> you're a good butcher.<br> You're an intelligent,<br> decent, sensitive man,<br> and, well, I have<br> a feeling about you.<br> Like, well, like<br> sometimes one of my kids<br> comes in to see me about<br> something or other,<br> and some of these kids<br> in my classes,<br> they have so much warmth<br> and so much capacity.<br> Well, that's the feeling<br> I have about you.<br> If you were<br> one of my students,<br> I'd say, "go ahead and<br> buy the butcher shop."<br> "You're a good butcher."<br> There's lots of things<br> I could do with this shop.<br> I could organize<br> my own supermarket,<br> get a bunch of neighborhood<br> merchants together.<br> That's what a lot<br> of them are doing.<br> What do you think?<br> I think anything<br> you want to do<br> you'll do well.<br> I'm catholic.<br> Are you catholic?<br> Yes, I am.<br> Look, I only got<br> about 3 bucks on me now,<br> but I only live<br> about 8 blocks away.<br> Why don't we walk<br> back to my house?<br> I'll get some dough,<br> and we'll step out.<br> I should get home.<br> It's only 11:45.<br> The clock's right up there.<br> I really should get home.<br> I told my father...<br> well, I suppose a<br> little while longer.<br> Do you suppose there's<br> someplace around here<br> I could put on some makeup?<br> Hey, mac-you got a<br> ladies' room around here?<br> In the back.<br> So she told me,<br> at the risk of her life.<br> She was always<br> a little thin in the hips.<br> The doctor said if she<br> had any more babies,<br> she'd risk her life.<br> When she told me,<br> she already had 6.<br> She was always<br> going to the hospital<br> or coming from it.<br> She was hatching them<br> out like eggs.<br> Her husband's<br> a skinny fellow.<br> I saw her.<br> She was big as a barrel.<br> Hey, Lou. You seen Marty?<br> No.<br> I ain't seen him<br> all night.<br> Where is everybody?<br> Didn't you tell me<br> having another would kill you?<br> And her husband's<br> a little bit of a man.<br> Last tuesday she<br> gave birth to her baby<br> a fine, healthy boy.<br> So the doctor was wrong.<br> Oh, no. She died<br> there in the hospital.<br> Oh, that's a sad story.<br> And her husband's<br> that little fellow,<br> works in peter reeves?<br> That's the one<br> oh, that's a sad story.<br> It would mean moving<br> out to port chester.<br> It's silly to think<br> of commuting.<br> I'd have to take<br> the subway to 125th,<br> then the bus<br> to the railroad,<br> then take the new<br> haven out to port chester.<br> Then I have a 20-minute<br> bus ride out of port chester.<br> Somebody suggested<br> that I buy a car,<br> but I'm terrified<br> of cars.<br> I'm always afraid<br> I'll kill someone.<br> Of course, it is<br> a fine opportunity for me.<br> I could never hope to be<br> the head of a department<br> in the new york city system,<br> especially in science.<br> Of course, I'm not sure i<br> want to be a department head.<br> It's mostly executive<br> and administrative work.<br> On the other hand-<br> well, anyway,<br> I told you about my father.<br> And, well, he depends<br> on me a great deal.<br> Let me tell you, Clara<br> I think you're<br> kidding yourself.<br> I used to thin<br> k about leaving home<br> that's what I would say<br> - "my mother needs me."<br> But when you really<br> come down to it,<br> that ain't it at all.<br> We're afraid<br> to go out on our own.<br> It's a big step<br> to go out on your own.<br> I think you're<br> kidding yourself<br> when you say your<br> father needs you.<br> Actually, you<br> need your father.<br> You know what I mean?<br> You're living at home now,<br> and you got your father<br> and mother there.<br> You could go o<br> n being a little girl.<br> I'm afraid<br> of being lonely.<br> You won't be so lonely<br> you'll make friends<br> right away.<br> Well, actually,<br> I don't make friends easily.<br> What are you<br> talking about?<br> You're a real<br> likeable person.<br> You'll make friends in<br> port chester, 1, 2, 3.<br> You'll have people<br> visiting you all the time.<br> I'll come up<br> and visit you.<br> I'll get m<br> y brother's car,<br> or you can call me when you<br> feel blue, or I'll call you.<br> It'll be real nice<br> don't be so afraid<br> hey, Marty!<br> Marty, over here!<br> Hello, Ralph.<br> Come over here<br> a minute!<br> Excuse me a minute<br> sure.<br> You'll like this guy.<br> He's a nice guy.<br> Who's this Marty?<br> This guy's a nice guy.<br> Hi, Ralph.<br> Hello, Leo<br> hey, come here<br> a minute.<br> We got an odd squirrel.<br> You interested?<br> What do you mean, Ralph?<br> Hey, Louise, I want you<br> to meet Marty Piletti.<br> That's Louise Kelly.<br> Hiya.<br> Are we gonna<br> sit around all night?<br> Listen, Marty, these<br> here squirrels are nurses.<br> Money in the bank, man.<br> We're all going over<br> to Leo's house later<br> because there's<br> nobody there.<br> These are the girls<br> I told you about.<br> Wanna get in the car?<br> She's a nice-looking doll.<br> I'm with a girl, Ralph<br> get rid of her.<br> This is money in the bank.<br> I can't.
