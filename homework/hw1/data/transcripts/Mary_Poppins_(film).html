If you'd<br> compute my wages...<br> Oh, gracious!<br> You're not leaving?<br> What will Mr Banks say?<br> He'll be cross when he finds<br> the children missing.<br> Put these away. The 'cause<br> infuriates Mr Banks.<br> I beseech you,<br> please reconsider.<br> Think of the children.<br> Think of Mr Banks. He was<br> just getting used to you.<br> Posts, everyone!<br> Fire!<br> - I do beseech you...<br> - My wages, if you please.<br> Bit early tonight, Admiral?<br> Nonsense. Bang on<br> the dot, as usual.<br> How's the world of finance?<br> Never better.<br> Money's sound, credit<br> rates are moving up,<br> - and the pound is admired everywhere.<br> - Good.<br> How about you?<br> Bit chancy, I'd say.<br> The Wind's up. The<br> glass is falling.<br> - Don't like it.<br> - Good. Good, good.<br> Banks, you're steering into<br> a nasty piece of weather.<br> Banks!<br> Do you hear me?<br> Hello, Katie Nanna. That<br> must be heavy. Allow me.<br> Hmph!<br> What a very pretty hat.<br> of deep satisfaction.<br> Much as a King Astride<br> his noble steed.<br> Thank you.<br> When I return from daily<br> strife to hearth and wife.<br> How pleasant is<br> the life I lead.<br> - Dear, the children...<br> - Yes, yes, yes.<br> I run my home precisely<br> on schedule.<br> At 6:01, I march<br> through my door.<br> My slippers, Sherry, and<br> pipe are due at 6:02.<br> Consistent is the life I lead<br> George, they're missing.<br> Splendid, splendid.<br> It's grand to be an<br> Englishman in 1910.<br> King Edward's on the throne<br> It's the age of men.<br> I'm the Lord of my castle<br> The sovereign, the liege.<br> I treat my subjects<br> servants, children, wife.<br> With a firm, but gentle<br> hand Noblesse oblige.<br> It's 6:03, and the heirs to my<br> dominion are scrubbed and tubbed.<br> And adequately fed.<br> And so I'll pat them on the<br> head and send them off to bed.<br> Ah, lordly is the life I lead<br> Winifred, where<br> are the children?<br> They're not here, dear.<br> Of course they're here.<br> Where else would they be?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You don't know?<br> They're missing. Katie Nanna<br> has looked everywhere.<br> Very well. I'll deal<br> with this at once.<br> The police station.<br> Quickly, please.<br> We needn't bother the police.<br> The fact is...<br> Facts cloud the issue.<br> One fact alone is clear.<br> Katie Nanna's faltered.<br> She's disappointed us. I<br> shall bring her to book...<br> Oh.<br> - She's left us, hasn't she?<br> - Yes, only just.<br> - George Banks here.<br> a matter of some urgency.<br> Please send a policeman.<br> The policeman's here, George.<br> What? Oh. Very prompt.<br> Wonderful service.<br> Thank you so much. Good night.<br> Come in, constable.<br> While on duty across the park,<br> I noted some stray valuables.<br> - I believe they're yours.<br> - Valuables?<br> Come along now.<br> Jane.<br> Michael.<br> Winifred, don't be emotional.<br> I wouldn't be too hard on them, Sir.<br> They've had a long, weary walk today.<br> Children, come here at once.<br> Well?<br> - Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.<br> - It was Windy...<br> And the kite was too strong.<br> The kite ran away,<br> Sir, not the children.<br> Thank you. I'll manage this.<br> It wasn't a good kite.<br> We made it ourselves.<br> Perhaps if you helped us...<br> That's the ticket. Kites<br> are skittish things.<br> Only last week...<br> I'm very grateful<br> to you, constable.<br> The cook will find you<br> a plate of something.<br> I shall now return to my duties.<br> Thank you, constable.<br> Good night, miss. Good night,<br> ma'am. Good night, Sir.<br> "Cook will find something."<br> I'm awfully sorry<br> about this, George.<br> You'll want to discuss it.<br> I would, indeed.<br> Ellen, take the<br> children upstairs.<br> Yes, Sir.<br> I knew it.<br> Who bears the brunt<br> of everything?<br> Me, that's who.<br> They don't want an honest<br> working girl here.<br> They need a ruddy zoo keeper.<br> Sorry.<br> When I chose Katie Nanna,<br> I thought she'd be firm.<br> She looked solemn, cross.<br> Never confuse efficiency<br> with a liver complaint.<br> I'll do better next time.<br> Next time? You've engaged six nannies.<br> They've all been unqualified disasters.<br> I quite agree.<br> Choosing a nanny is<br> a delicate task,<br> requiring insight, balanced judgment,<br> and an ability to read character.<br> Under the circumstances,<br> it might be apropos to select<br> the next person myself.<br> Would you, George?<br> I'll do this properly.<br> I'll advertise in The Times.<br> - Take this down, please.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Wanted... No, required...<br> Nanny.<br> Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.<br> A British nanny must be a general.<br> The future empire lies<br> within her hands.<br> And so the person that we<br> need to mould the breed.<br> It is a nanny who<br> can give commands.<br> - Getting this, Winifred?<br> - Yes, every word.<br> A British bank is<br> run with precision.<br> A British home<br> requires nothing less.<br> Tradition, discipline, and<br> rules must be the tools.<br> Without them disorder,<br> catastrophe, anarchy.<br> In short, you have<br> a ghastly mess.<br> Splendid, George. Inspirational.<br> The Times will be so pleased.<br> - Father.<br> - Yes?<br> We've discussed everything, and<br> we're very sorry about today.<br> I should think so.<br> - It was wrong.<br> - Indeed.<br> We'll cooperate<br> with the new nanny.<br> I'll be glad for your help.<br> That's why we wrote<br> this advertisement.<br> Advertisement for what?<br> The new nanny.<br> - You wrote an...<br> - George, let's listen.<br> You wanted our help.<br> Oh, very well.<br> "Wanted, a nanny for two<br> adorable children."<br> "Adorable." That's<br> debatable, I must say.<br> "If you want this choice position."<br> "Have a cheery disposition"<br> Jane, I don't...<br> "Rosy cheeks, no warts"<br> I wrote that.<br> "Play games, all sorts.<br> "You must be kind.<br> "You must be witty.<br> "Very sweet and<br> fairly pretty".<br> - That's...<br> - George, please.<br> "Take us on outings,<br> give us treats."<br> "Sing songs, bring sweets."<br> "Never be cross or cruel."<br> "Never give us Castor<br> oil or gruel."<br> "Love us as a son<br> and daughter."<br> "And never smell<br> of barley water"<br> I wrote that, too.<br> "If you won't scold<br> and dominate us.<br> "We will never give you<br> 'cause to hate us.<br> "We won't hide your<br> spectacles so you can't see.<br> "Put toads in your bed<br> or pepper in your tea.<br> "Hurry, nanny.<br> "Many thanks.<br> "Sincerely.<br> "Jane and Michael Banks".<br> Thank you. Most interesting.<br> We've had enough of this.<br> Please return to the nursery.<br> - They were only trying to help.<br> - I'm aware of that.<br> I congratulate myself<br> on stepping in.<br> "Play games, sing songs,<br> give treats." Ridiculous.<br> No question in my mind. Now<br> is the time for action.<br> The Times, please.<br> I don't know the number.<br> Oh, George, you're<br> always so forceful.<br> The Times? George Banks,<br> Cherry Tree Lane.<br> I wish to place<br> an advertisement.<br> - Time gun ready?<br> - Ready and charged, Sir.<br> I'll take the report,<br> Mr Binnacle.<br> Wind's coming from<br> a new quarter.<br> So it is.<br> - Sir.<br> - What?<br> Something taking place<br> off the port bow.<br> Ghastly looking<br> crew, I must say.<br> There's a queue of nannies<br> outside. Shall I show them in?<br> I said 8:00, and<br> - 10, 9...<br> - Posts!<br> It is now 8:00.<br> Yes, Sir.<br> I have told you<br> repeatedly, Ellen,<br> I dislike being<br> hurried into things.<br> I don't understand.<br> They're nothing like<br> what we advertised for.<br> Woof! Woof! Woof!<br> Michael, look!<br> - Perhaps it's a witch.<br> - Nonsense. Witches have brooms.<br> It's her. It's the person. She's<br> answered our advertisement.<br> Rosy cheeks and everything.<br> - Show them in, one at a time.<br> - Yes, Sir.<br> - Come in, one at a time.<br> - Thank you.<br> You are the father of<br> Jane and Michael Banks?<br> I said, you are the father<br> of Jane and Michael Banks?<br> Yes, of course.<br> You brought your references?<br> I never give references.<br> I believe it very old-fashioned.<br> We'll see about that then.<br> Now then, the qualifications.<br> Item one, "A cheery<br> disposition."<br> I am never cross.<br> Item two, "Rosy cheeks."<br> Obviously.<br> Item three, "Play<br> games, all sorts."<br> They'll find my games<br> extremely diverting.<br> Where did you get this paper?<br> I tore it up.<br> Excuse me.<br> Item four, "You must be kind."<br> I am kind, but extremely firm.<br> Have you lost something?<br> That paper.

Really, I do.<br> But everything ends up<br> so hilarious. I can't...<br> I can't help...<br> That will be enough of that.<br> It's time to go home.<br> Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.<br> That's the saddest<br> thing I ever heard.<br> Come along, children.<br> Must you really go?<br> People come to see me all the time,<br> and we have such a lovely time.<br> Then they go home, and I'm<br> very, very sad about it.<br> Don't worry. We'll return soon.<br> It was lovely.<br> - Keep an eye on him, Bert.<br> - I'll stay a while.<br> Thank you.<br> Uncle Albert,<br> I got a jolly joke I saved<br> for just such an occasion.<br> - Want to hear it?<br> - I'd be so grateful.<br> Righto. It's about me granddad.<br> One night, he had a nightmare.<br> So scared he chewed<br> his pillow to bits.<br> Next morning, I says,<br> "How do you feel?"<br> He says, "A little<br> down in the mouth."<br> There's nothing<br> like a good joke.<br> No, and that's nothing<br> like a good joke.<br> Bit late tonight, aren't you?<br> I say, Banks!<br> Is anything the matter, Banks?<br> Banks!<br> We're so glad you're home!<br> We had the most<br> wonderful afternoon.<br> I know a man with a<br> wooden leg named Smith.<br> We don't know anyone<br> called Smith.<br> The second chap says, "What's<br> his other leg's name?"<br> And a party on the ceiling.<br> Children, be quiet.<br> Mary Poppins says<br> we'll go again.<br> Oh?<br> Oh, Mary Poppins said that?<br> Please return to your room.<br> Mary Poppins, will<br> you come with me?<br> As you wish.<br> Mary Poppins, I regret<br> what I must say.<br> Good evening, George.<br> Is anything the matter?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> I have to dress for my rally.<br> - I'd rather you be present.<br> - Of course, George.<br> Mary Poppins, I confess<br> I'm disappointed in you.<br> She's for it. I've<br> heard this before.<br> I don't deny I'm<br> partially responsible<br> for allowing the children's<br> worthless frivolity.<br> But they must learn the<br> seriousness of life.<br> But they're only children.<br> In light of what's happened...<br> George, are you certain?<br> I believe I am.<br> is run with precision.<br> A British home<br> requires nothing less.<br> Tradition, discipline, and<br> rules must be the tools.<br> Without them disorder,<br> chaos, moral disintegration.<br> In short, you have<br> a ghastly mess<br> I quite agree.<br> The children must be<br> moulded, shaped and taught.<br> That life's a looming battle<br> to be faced and fought<br> I'm disturbed to hear my children<br> talking about popping into pictures,<br> consorting with racehorse<br> persons, fox hunting...<br> I don't mind that.<br> It's tradition.<br> But parties on the ceiling?<br> Having tea parties<br> on the ceiling?<br> And other highly<br> questionable outings...<br> If they must go on outings.<br> These outings ought to be fraught<br> with purpose, yes, and practicality.<br> These silly words like.<br> Superca...<br> Super...<br> Supercal...<br> Supercalifragili-<br> sticexpialidocious.<br> Yes, well done.<br> And popping through pictures have<br> little use, fulfill no basic need.<br> They've got to learn the honest<br> truth Despite their youth.<br> They must learn.<br> About the life you lead.<br> Exactly.<br> They must feel the thrill of<br> totting up a balanced book.<br> A thousand ciphers<br> neatly in a row.<br> Quite right.<br> When gazing at a graph<br> that shows the profits up.<br> Their little cup of<br> Joy should overflow.<br> Precisely.<br> It's time they learnt to<br> walk in your footsteps.<br> My footsteps.<br> To tread your straight and<br> narrow path with pride.<br> With pride.<br> Tomorrow, just as you suggest.<br> Pressed and dressed Jane and<br> Michael will be at your side.<br> Splendid! You've hit the nail...<br> At my side? Where are we going?<br> To the bank.<br> - The bank?<br> - Yes.<br> Tomorrow's an important day.<br> I'll see they have a<br> proper night's sleep.<br> Did I say I'd take the<br> children to the bank?<br> It sounded that way.<br> And why not?<br> Capital idea.<br> Just the medicine they need for all this<br> sugary female thinking they get here.<br> Quite right. Good idea.<br> Quite right.<br> Mary Poppins, we<br> won't let you go.<br> What do you mean?<br> Weren't you sacked?<br> Sacked? I am never sacked.<br> - Oh, Mary Poppins!<br> - Hooray!<br> Neither am I a maypole.<br> - But...<br> - Goats butt.<br> Birds fly.<br> Children going out with their<br> father get some sleep.<br> An outing with Father?<br> He's never taken<br> us on an outing.<br> He's never taken us anywhere.<br> How did you manage it?<br> You gave him the idea.<br> How impertinent!<br> Me giving ideas to people?<br> Really.<br> - Where's he taking us?<br> - The bank.<br> Michael, the city! Father<br> can point out the sights.<br> Most things he can.<br> Sometimes people, through no fault of<br> their own, can't see past their nose.<br> Past their nose?<br> Yes. Sometimes a little<br> thing is quite important.<br> Oh, look. The cathedral.<br> Father passes that every day.<br> the steps of St. Paul's.<br> The little old<br> bird woman comes.<br> In her own special way<br> to the people she calls.<br> Come buy my bags<br> full of crumbs.<br> Come feed the little birds.<br> Show them you care.<br> And you'll be glad if you do.<br> Their young ones are hungry.<br> Their nests are so bare.<br> All it takes is tuppence.<br> From you.<br> Feed the birds.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Tuppence, tuppence.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Feed the birds.<br> That's what she cries.<br> While overhead, her<br> birds fill the skies.<br> All around the cathedral.<br> The saints and apostles.<br> Look down as she<br> sells her wares.<br> Although you can't see it.<br> You know they are smiling.<br> Each time someone shows.<br> That he cares.<br> Though her words are<br> simple and few.<br> Listen, listen.<br> She's calling to you.<br> Feed the birds.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Tuppence, tuppence.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Though her words are<br> simple and few.<br> Listen, listen.<br> She's calling to you.<br> Feed the birds.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Tuppence.<br> Tuppence.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Now, remember. Be on<br> your best behaviour.<br> Isn't it your bank?<br> As a younger officer,<br> it is, sort of.<br> Michael, look.<br> It's her!<br> - Who? It's who?<br> - The bird woman.<br> Just like Mary Poppins said.<br> You see her?<br> Of course I can. Do you think I<br> can't see past the end of my nose?<br> Listen, she's saying it.<br> Feed the birds.<br> Tuppence a bag.<br> Of course she's saying it.<br> - May we feed the birds?<br> - Whatever for?<br> - I have tuppence.<br> - Just this once.<br> Waste your money on birds?<br> Certainly not.<br> But Mary Poppins...<br> I'm not interested in Mary<br> Poppins nor in hearing her name.<br> But it's my tuppence.<br> Michael, don't throw<br> your money away!<br> At the bank, I'll<br> show you what to do.<br> It's extremely interesting.<br> Hello, Banks.
