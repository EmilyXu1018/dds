                        - Come on, come on. It's all right.<br> Yes, yes, it's all right.<br> Wake up, Will.<br> Starboard bow ahoy!<br> - What is it, Slade?<br> - Thought I heard somethin'.<br> Sounded like a bell.<br> - Native fishermen, perhaps.<br> - Or a reef marker, sir.<br> Mr Calamy, the lead, if you please.<br> - By the mark, five fathom.<br> - Five fathom!<br> - Sand and broken shell.<br> - Sand and broken shell.<br> What is it?<br> Um...<br> Two points off the starboard bow,<br> in the fog bank.<br> What was it? A sail?<br> - I don't know what it was.<br> - Should we beat to quarters?<br> - I can't be certain.<br> - You're officer of the watch.<br> Hollom, you must make a decision.<br> We shall beat to quarters!<br> Rouse up! Rouse up!<br> Sleepers awake!<br> Move! Move along! Move along!<br> Jump to it, boys! Jump to it!<br> Light along there!<br> Sighting in heavy fog.<br> - Handsomely on the yards tackle.<br> - Topmen aloft.<br> - Where away?<br> - Uh...<br> Two points off the starboard bow, sir.<br> Not a mile distant.<br> - You sure, Mr Hollom?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Man-of-war?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> It was only for a moment.<br> I thought I saw a shape.<br> - Did you see it, Mr Calamy?<br> - No, sir.<br> Well, you did the right thing, Mr Hollom.<br> Go to your stations.<br> The deck's yours, Tom.<br> Sir.<br> Clear away! And launch boats!<br> - Quit your dawdling!<br> - You heard the man!<br> Lower away!<br> Haul both your yard tackles!<br> Strike the bell!<br> Down! All hands down!<br> Hands to your stations!<br> Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.<br> Run out the starboard battery.<br> Mr Allen, come up on the wind.<br> Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.<br> Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.<br> Sergeant! Take your section<br> into the main top.<br> We stand tall on the quarterdeck, son.<br> All of us.<br> - Mr Boyle, run up the colours.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Note for the log, Mr Watt.<br> "Engaged enemy frigate at six bells. "<br> - Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.<br> - Straight at 'em, sir.<br> Bill!<br> Leave the swords!<br> Get the captain's silver below.<br> She's not in range yet!<br> Stand fast till she's close enough!<br> - Close with him amidships!<br> - Midships it is, sir!<br> For God's sake, don't drop anything!<br> Steady!<br> - Hold your positions!<br> - Hold your position! Courage, now!<br> - Hold steady, boys!<br> - Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet!<br> Mr Pullings, sir.<br> Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.<br> Clear the forward pin rails!<br> More sand on the floor!<br> On the up-roll... fire!<br> Down!<br> Relieving-tackles on the tiller!<br> You men, collect these wounded!<br> - Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.<br> - Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell!<br> Sir! To the taffrail!<br> The rudder's shot away.<br> The steering don't answer, sir.<br> We're fish in a barrel.<br> Why are we not firing?<br> Let me through.<br> Here, Joe! Here!<br> Hold it in there!<br> - He's on the larboard bow, sir.<br> - Bring up your small arms!<br> Prepare to repel boarders.<br> Seize your weapons<br> and wait for the word.<br> Your orders, sir?<br> Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes<br> over the stern and pull the boats in.<br> Put us in that fog, Tom.<br> Pull together, men!<br> Pull for the fog bank!<br> Run 'em out! Run 'em out!<br> Fire!<br> She's opened up a seam!<br> We need to get some oakum and pound it in.<br> Joe, a mallet and some irons!<br> She's gaining on us.<br> - We're nearly there, boys!<br> - Pull! Pull!<br> - Reach for it, men!<br> - We're home inside that fog!<br> Fire!<br> Pull for Lucky Jack!<br> We've done it!<br> Pipe down. Silence on deck.<br> They'll not find us in here!<br> Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.<br> Avast rowing.<br> Well done, lads.<br> Two feet six inches, sir... and holding.<br> - Good work, Mr Lamb.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> So, what's the butcher's bill?<br> Nine dead, 27 wounded.<br> Joe Plaice.<br> He has a severely depressed fracture of<br> the skull. I don't think he'll see out the night.<br> Lord Blakeney.<br> Just a broken arm, sir.<br> Well, you're in very good hands.<br> Im doing everything I can.<br> I know you were close to his father.<br> His father would've understood.<br> He knew the life. His mother, however...<br> Let me take a look at that brow of yours.<br> What?<br> Damn, he was good.<br> Just came out of nowhere.<br> Hit us with a full broadside,<br> cut across our tail and took out our rudder.<br> Damn fine gunnery.<br> We only slipped away because of the fog.<br> Quite fortunate, really.<br> He may have had the weather gauge,<br> but we had the weather gods.<br> I have no idea what it is you're talking about,<br> but he did seem to come off rather well.<br> Seven weeks sailing, and he happens<br> in darkness on our exact position.<br> Hm.<br> Well, the French have their spies<br> in England and elsewhere. As do we.<br> Indeed.<br> If he knew we were looking for him, he could<br> have stood to sea and passed well clear.<br> Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.<br> If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman!<br> It was an unfair match.<br> There was no dishonour in it.<br> She was more like a ship of the line.<br> You have to wonder about her hull.<br> Our shots wouldn't penetrate.<br> Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.<br> She had the weather gauge<br> and a clear advantage in firepower.<br> What is the weather gauge?<br> - Shall I show you again, Stephen?<br> - Not on the cloth!<br> It means she had the wind in her favour,<br> therefore control of the engagement.<br> And she had longer guns,<br> so she could hit us beyond our range.<br> The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.<br> - Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific...<br> - Could tip the war in Napoleon's favour.<br> By comparison, the Surprise<br> is a somewhat aged man-of-war.<br> - Am I not correct?<br> - Would you call me an aged man of war?<br> The Surprise is not old.<br> No one would call her old.<br> She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.<br> She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.<br> Very fast, if she's well-handled.<br> No, she's not old.<br> She's in her prime.<br> We can patch up the main and mizzen.<br> Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.<br> Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.<br> We can get home as we are.<br> We're not going home.<br> But to refit we need a port,<br> and the Acheron may be still looking for us.<br> We can refit at sea.<br> Here, where it shoals.<br> As you said, Mr Allen, she is taking the war to<br> the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.<br> But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly<br> heavier ship. She's out of our class.<br> She could be halfway to Cape Horn<br> by the time we're repaired.<br> Well then, there's not a moment to lose.<br> Is it true they put the last stitch<br> through your nose?<br> What do you mean?<br> Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your<br> hammock with the last stitch in your nose,<br> just to make sure you're not asleep.<br> Not through the nose. You'll tell them?<br> It's all right.<br> It's just the laudanum speaking.<br> I've never seen a braver patient.<br> Poor darling.<br> Never mind, soon have you fixed up.<br> I want good work now.<br> I'll need two men into the starboard<br> fore channels. Roberts, Chadwick.<br> That's nice work there.<br> Repair won't do here.<br> I need these replaced.<br> Mr Calamy. There's something<br> might interest you here.<br> Look. The captain carved that.<br> When he was a mid, no more than your age.<br> He's known this ship man and boy.<br> He says there's enough of his blood in the<br> woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.<br> I do understand your point, Mr Allen.<br> Your knowledge is beyond question.<br> However, a week in the Brazilian rainforest<br> looking for a new mast simply will not do.<br> The Acheron will be halfway to China.<br> Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which<br> is all I can hope to expect from any man.<br> Is them his brains?<br> No, that's just dried blood.<br> Those are his brains.<br> Physician, he is.<br> Ain't one of your common surgeons.<br> - Can I have the coin, please?<br> - Sir.<br> He wouldn't look at you<br> for under ten guineas on land.<br> And he knows his birds and beasts.<br> You show him a beetle<br> and he'll tell you what it's thinking.<br> Back to work, you loafers!<br> Eckhart, use your pipe.<br> Let's get on with it, gentlemen.<br> You're not a pennyweight of use<br> gawpin' here!<br> Still hasn't said a word, sir.<br> Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?<br> Much better, thank you, sir.<br> Well, good. Good.<br> The doctor told me<br> you were fond of reading, so I...<br> It has all of his major battles<br> and some fine illustrations.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?<br> I had the honour of serving with him.<br> At the Nile. A great victory.<br> You can find it in here, actually.<br> Page 135, if Im not mistaken.<br> Yes.<br> May I beg you to tell me<br> what kind of man he is?<br> You should read the book.<br> I will, sir. Thank you.<br> Here we go again.<br> Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.<br> Never a tune you could dance to,<br> not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.<br> How about this?<br> Or are you in the mood<br> for something more aggressive?<br> Salute.<br> Hats off.<br> What's all this about?<br> - What's this?<br> - It's the phantom, sir.<br> Excuse me. That's what the men call it.<br> It's the Acheron, sir.<br> You see, Will here, he seen her being built.<br> In Boston, sir. During the peace.<br> But she's Yankee-built, sir.<br> He was getting married, and his wife's<br> second cousin works in the yards,<br> so Will here saw the ship out of water.<br> Sir, I saw there was something right strange<br> about her, so I asked Joe...<br> So he described it to me<br> and I knocked you up a model, sir.<br> - And this framing is accurate?<br> - Exactly accurate, sir.<br> - Thank you, lads.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.<br> Thank you very much, sir.<br> - Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.<br> - We'll drink wine.<br> Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day...<br> Bluff above the water and sharp below.<br> Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run<br> as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.<br> Heavier, but fast despite it.<br> That's the future.<br> What a fascinating modern age we live in.<br> Planking and framing like that<br> would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.<br> That's why we couldn't dent her. She's<br> probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.<br> Now we know. Thank God for Warley<br> and his wife's second cousin.<br> She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.<br> Even if we did catch up with her...<br> I mean, to take her...<br> She's out of our class.<br> She's a 44-gun ship.<br> She's still vulnerable at the stern,<br> like the rest of us.<br> Hello, darling! How much for a kiss?<br> Quanto cost-o kiss-o?<br> - Name?<br> - My name is Maria.<br> Give us arrows. I give axe. Quick, mate.<br> Thank you, mate.<br> Gangway for the mail, please.<br> - Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.<br> - Era um navio francs.<br> - What's he saying?<br> - Estava indo pela costa?<br> Sim, estava. Indo pela costa ao sul.<br> A large man-of-war, French, stopped here<br> on the 10th, then headed south.<br> - Muito grande.<br> - Obrigado, senhor.<br> Somewhere here.<br> A full three weeks ahead.<br> Damn.<br> All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.<br> Aye, sir. Mr Hollar!<br> Let us complete our business here.<br> Hands, prepare to weigh anchor!<br> Put that woman down, Slade! This is a ship<br> of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello!<br> All hands, get these provisions stowed.<br> Well done.<br> Gentlemen...<br> - To wives and to sweethearts.<br> - To wives and sweethearts.<br> May they never meet.<br> Mr Howard, the bottle.<br> The bottle stands by you, sir.<br> Sir?<br> Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that<br> you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.<br> Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,<br> not much older than you are now.<br> And Mr Pullings... Mr Pullings<br> was a snivelling midshipman,<br> still yearning for hearth and home.<br> Did you meet him, sir?<br> Can you tell me what he's like?<br> I have had the honour<br> of dining with him twice.<br> He spoke to me on both occasions.<br> A master tactician<br> and a man of singular vision.<br> He always said in battle... "Never mind<br> the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em. "<br> Some would say not a great seaman,<br> but a great leader.<br> He's England's only hope<br> if old Boney intends to invade.<br> Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?<br> The first time that he spoke to me...<br> I shall never forget his words.<br> I remember it like it was yesterday.<br> He leaned across the table,<br> he looked me straight in the eye,<br> and he said "Aubrey...<br> may I trouble you for the salt?"<br> Ive always tried to say it<br> exactly as he did ever since.<br> The second time...<br> The second time he told me a story...<br> about how someone offered him<br> a boat cloak on a cold night.<br> And he said no, he didn't need it.<br> That he was quite warm.<br> His zeal for king and country kept him warm.<br> I know it sounds absurd,<br> and were it from another man,<br> you'd cry out "Oh, what pitiful stuff'<br> and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.<br> But with Nelson...<br> you felt your heart glow.<br> - Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?<br> - You did indeed, sir.<br> Well then, he would seem to be the exception<br> to the rule that authority corrupts.<br> - To Lord Nelson.<br> - To Lord Nelson.<br> To Lord Nelson.<br> Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?<br> I do.<br> Which would you choose?<br> Neither. There's no difference between them.<br> They're the same species of curculio.<br> If you had to choose.<br> If you were forced to make a choice.<br> If there was no other...<br> Well then, if you're going to push me...<br> I would choose the right-hand weevil.<br> It has significant advantage<br> in both length and breadth.<br> There, I have you!<br> You're completely dished.<br> Do you not know that in the service one must<br> always choose the lesser of two weevils?<br> He who would pun would pick a pocket.<br> Really! Weevils!<br> - To the lesser of two weevils.<br> - To the lesser of two weevils!<br> Yay, Joe!<br> Go on, Joe!<br> The Lord taketh...<br> and the Lord giveth away.<br> You hear that? He said something!<br> Doctor! He spoke, Doctor!<br> Well done indeed, Stephen.<br> Adieu to you Spanish ladies<br> Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain<br> For we've received orders<br> to sail for old England<br> We hope in a short time<br> to see you again<br> What a wonderfully true voice<br> Mr Hollom possesses.<br> Indeed.<br> Come, all you bold young thoughtless men<br> A warning take by me<br> And never leave your happy homes<br> to sail the raging sea<br> On deck there! Sail ho!<br> Looks like a frigate!<br> How did it get there?<br> - We must turn and fight.<br> - But he has the weather gauge again.<br> He must've been watching us<br> from some inlet.<br> My God. What can we do?<br> He has us by the hip.<br> Run like smoke and oakum.<br> - We'll have to bend every sail.<br> - We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to!<br> We must survive this day.<br> Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.<br> All hands, make sail!<br> This is the second time he's done this to me.<br> There will not be a third.<br> I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel<br> of that there phantom ship.<br> You better hold fast.<br> What is it with this man?<br> Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?<br> His boy, God forbid?<br> He fights like you, Jack.<br> Bring the sun down to the horizon.<br> When its lower limb is touching the horizon...<br> Williamson, look to your sextant!<br> When the orb is no longer rising...<br> then it has reached its zenith<br> and that would be noon.<br> - Sir?<br> - Mr Pullings.<br> - Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Call noon. It's your class.<br> - Sir, that's noon.<br> - Mr Nichols, make that twelve.<br> Six hours?<br> Five at most.<br> Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.<br> She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.<br> Jibbo, make fast those whips.<br> We didn't want to make it any taller,<br> on account of this wind.<br> - Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?<br> - Your first command.<br> Quickly. She'll be on top of us.<br> Take the weight on the yard tackles.<br> Fend her off, fend her off.<br> Lower away on the main.<br> - Wouldn't want to lose you.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> There's a painter. Pass her aft.<br> Outside everything, mind.<br> Lively now.<br> We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.<br> - Mind what the captain told you.<br> - Pull, boys. That's it.<br> Now.<br> Killick there! Douse your light.<br> Mr Allen, make ready.<br> Hello. We caught a fish.<br> Take the helm, Bonden.<br> - Now, tell me that wasn't fun.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hard a larboard!<br> Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.<br> Ill take this watch.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.<br> You know his orders.<br> Well done, sir.<br> She's a right phantom, she is. The way<br> she come up again, right behind us like that.<br> Out of nowhere. And right behind us.<br> Like that first time, out the fog.<br> With our shot bouncin' off her.<br> Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.<br> Phantom or no, she's a privateer,<br> and Lucky Jack'll have her.<br> You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.<br> - Is she like a pirate?<br> - No, they're not pirates, Lofty.<br> Oh, no. If they were,<br> we could hang them when we catch 'em.<br> Privateer gets a piece of paper<br> from the Frenchies<br> says they can hunt down<br> anything with our flag.<br> They go after rich merchantmen and the like.<br> Hey, but think on our share<br> of the prize money.<br> She'll be loaded with gold<br> and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.<br> That's all very well, Nagle.<br> Got to get home to spend it, but.<br> Never met a dead man<br> who bought me a drink.<br> And Ive never met a live one<br> that you bought one for, neither.<br> Sitting up all night, catching your death<br> of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.<br> Thank you, Killick.<br> Bonden.<br> That's enough easting.<br> Set a course sou'- sou'west.<br> Aye, sir. Sou'- sou'west.<br> Sail!<br> Two points off starboard bow!<br> Three cheers for Lucky Jack!<br> Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!<br> She's ours, boys!<br> - Foul! You got away before me.<br> - Set royals and courses.<br> - Sir.<br> Have the idlers placed along the rails.<br> Ive never seen the like.<br> It has to be more than 100 sea miles<br> and he brings us up on his tail.<br> That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.<br> My God, that's seamanship.<br> Told you it would work, Will.<br> We'll have them by nightfall.<br> - I think we've got him, sir.<br> - And the wind favours us this time.<br> Don't count your eggs<br> before they're in the pudding.<br> Still, if we can close this gap<br> and get up behind her, she may well be ours.<br> Touch wood. Scratch a stay.<br> Turn three times.<br> May the Lord and saints preserve us.<br> Turn!<br> Move along, man.<br> We'll have lost him before you rig it up!<br> Hold!<br> - 12 knots, sir.<br> - That's 12 knots. That's good.<br> I want more. Have all the spare hands<br> placed on the windward rail.<br> Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.<br> All hands on starboard rail!<br> Come up the larboard topsail sheets!<br> - We're crackin' on!<br> - We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it!<br> Captain knows this ship.<br> He knows what she can take.<br> - Arh!<br> - Mr Hollar!<br> Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft!<br> No lounging, boy!<br> Lifelines, fore and aft!<br> Double-grape that launch!<br> Cape Horn, Doctor.<br> Close the lid.<br> There's enough water in the grog.<br> Thank you for that, Davies.<br> Reckon the captain will follow him<br> round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?<br> I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.<br> It's a devil ship, I tell ya.<br> And it's leadin' us right into a trap.<br> She's making a run for the Horn, sir.<br> Ill not vouch for this mast.<br> Not around the Horn.<br> Thank you. Your comments<br> will be noted in the log.<br> Sail trimmers to their stations!<br> Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.<br> Give 'em a pull and belay!<br> We're closing on her, Tom.<br> Ill not give up now.<br> Come up on the wind, Barret.<br> Set a course sou'west by west.<br> Sou'west by west, sir.<br> Mr Calamy.<br> Idlers and waisters below.<br> We're for the Horn, boys!<br> Close reef topsails!<br> Lively, lads!<br> Batten down those hatches<br> before we're on the bottom!<br> Johansson, Truelove! To the mizzen!<br> All secure.<br> Down ye go, lads.<br> Mr Hollom, help young Warley<br> on the mizzen topgallant.<br> - Ill need more men, sir.<br> - Yes. Go.<br> Mr Hollom, sir! Help me!<br> Tudor, Ellers! To Mr Allen!<br> You men, lay aloft.<br> The mizzen topgallant. Light along!<br> Help!<br> Help me!<br> Man overboard!<br> Mizzen's gone! Hands to the taffrail!<br> He's over there, sir!<br> Swim for the wreckage, man!<br> Swim, man!<br> Over here!<br> Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,<br> anything that floats, overboard.<br> She's broaching! We're losing her!<br> Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor!<br> We must cut it loose!<br> It's going to sink us!<br> Sir, he's going to make it! He can do it!<br> - Come on, Will!<br> - Come on! Hand over hand!<br> For God's sake, Will, swim!<br> Swim for the wreckage, Will!<br> You can do it, Will!<br> - Swim! Come on!<br> - Come on, Will! Swim!<br> - He's been at it again.<br> - Who's that, then?<br> - The Jonah.<br> - What's that?<br> The deaths in actual battle<br> are the easiest to bear.<br> For my own part, those who die under my<br> knife, or from some subsequent infection...<br> I have to remind myself that it was<br> the enemy that killed them, not me.<br> That young man was a casualty of war.<br> As you said yourself,<br> you have to choose the lesser of two evils.<br> Weevils.<br> The crew will take it badly.<br> Warley was popular.<br> Have they expressed<br> any feelings on the matter to you?<br> Jack, before answering,<br> Im compelled to ask,<br> am I speaking with my old friend<br> or to the ship's captain?<br> To the captain Id say<br> there's little I detest more than an informer.<br> - Now you're talking like an Irishman.<br> - I am an Irishman.<br> Well, as a friend, then.<br> As a friend, I would say that I have never once<br> doubted your abilities as a captain.<br> Speak plainly, Stephen.<br> Perhaps we should have<br> turned back weeks ago.<br> The men... of course<br> they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,<br> rightfully confident of victory.<br> But therein lies the problem.<br> You're not accustomed to defeat.<br> And chasing this larger, faster ship with<br> its long guns is beginning to smack of pride.<br> It's not a question of pride.<br> It is a question of duty.<br> Duty. Yes, Ive heard it well spoken of.<br> Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world<br> through a microscope is your prerogative.<br> This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever<br> grist the mill requires to fulfil my duty.<br> Whatever the cost?<br> Whatever the cost.<br> To follow orders with no regard for cost.<br> Can you really claim there's<br> nothing personal in this call to duty?<br> Orders are subject<br> to the requirement of the service.<br> My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.<br> I exceeded my orders a long time ago.<br> Got it.<br> The wind's backing, sir.<br> Sir, we just can't hold<br> this westerly course any longer.<br> If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,<br> we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.<br> How far south, sir?<br> As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Lively!<br> - Due south, please, Mr Bonden.<br> - Due south, sir.<br> Heave! Steady!<br> Ahh...<br> Hurray!<br> Clearly something nautical and fascinating<br> just happened. I am at a loss.<br> We have made our turn northward.<br> We are headed back toward the sun.<br> - To the sun.<br> - To the sun!<br> Oh, and by way of anticipation of this event,<br> I have asked Killick<br> to prepare something special.<br> - Killick! Killick there...<br> - Im already here, ain't I?<br> Gentlemen, I give you...<br> our destination.<br> - It's the Galpagos Islands!<br> - The Galpagos Islands!<br> Our whaling fleet is there.<br> And their cargo would put a pretty penny<br> into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.<br> That's where the Acheron will be.<br> Sure as there's carts to horses.<br> So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me...<br> a slice of Albemarle.<br> And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.<br> Perfect.<br> And the Acheron... for me.<br> Safe and sound at home again<br> Let the waters roar, Jack<br> Long we tossed on the rolling main<br> Now we're safe ashore, Jack<br> Don't forget your old shipmates<br> Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!<br> We have worked the selfsame gun<br> Quarterdeck division<br> Sponger I, and loader you<br> Through the whole commission<br> Long we tossed on the rolling main<br> Now we're safe ashore, Jack<br> Don't forget your old shipmates<br> Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!<br> Las Encantadas.<br> The Enchanted Isles. They're said<br> to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.<br> When we get there,<br> we'll have to stop for food and water.<br> I promise you, during that time -<br> several days at least -<br> you can wander at will, collecting bugs<br> and beetles to your heart's content.<br> You'll be the first naturalist<br> to set foot on the islands, Ill wager.<br> Well, I would like that of all things.<br> - Is it an insect?<br> - Yes.<br> Doesn't look like one.<br> I mean, it looks like a stick.<br> Yes, that's the whole point.<br> It's disguised itself in order to survive.<br> See, there's a spider<br> that's disguised itself as an ant.<br> And here's an insect that's taken on the shape<br> of a thorn to save itself from the birds.<br> Did God make them change?<br> Does God make them change?<br> Yes, certainly.<br> But do they also change themselves?<br> Now that is a question, isn't it?<br> Sir! Sir, we've raised the Galpagos!<br> Im coming!<br> - Look. Beyond the rock.<br> - Oh, yes, I see.<br> What is it? Curious, eh?<br> Some type of gull?<br> - There's an ugly devil.<br> - Disgusting! It's got warts all over it.<br> Ugly devils, aren't they?<br> I can't see any women.<br> Just ducks and lizards.<br> What, no women? It ain't natural.<br> How extraordinary.<br> What is, sir?<br> Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,<br> but they are flightless.<br> Do you see their underdeveloped wings?<br> By all that's holy,<br> I think that's unknown to science.<br> The dragons don't seem to bother them.<br> No. They're a type of iguana, I should think.<br> Therefore, they're vegetarian.<br> - Will you catch one?<br> - A pair of them, I should think.<br> Then you can present<br> one of their offspring to the king.<br> - Look. There's one going for a swim.<br> - Iguanas don't swim.<br> These ones do.<br> Well, Ill be damned.<br> Two new species in as many minutes.<br> That's remarkable.<br> All hands about ship! Off tacks and sheets!<br> Prepare the mainsail to haul!<br> - Aubrey.<br> - Hogg. Master of the Albatross.<br> God bless you, Captain.<br> God bless you all.<br> - Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Mr Howard, stand your men down.<br> - Royal Marines, trail arms!<br> We was coming back for fresh lines<br> no more than a week ago.<br> Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody<br> ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates!<br> Crew prisoner, captain dead.<br> She were a big black three-master.<br> Break your heart, it would.<br> 12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they<br> took. We been out more than two years, see.<br> And her course?<br> Maybe a point south of west,<br> following the rest of the fleet.<br> Mr Pullings, enter these men's names<br> into the ship's books.<br> Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.<br> All hands, make sail!<br> Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?<br> Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.<br> - Jack, have you forgotten your promise?<br> - Subject to the requirements of the service.<br> I cannot delay for the sake<br> of an iguana or a giant peccary.<br> Fascinating, no doubt,<br> but of no immediate application.<br> There is, I think, an opportunity here<br> to serve both our purposes.<br> As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.<br> You need to sail around it.<br> I could walk across it.<br> I have known you to spend hours<br> staring into a deserted bird's nest.<br> I could walk briskly, pausing only<br> for important measurements.<br> Making discoveries that could advance<br> our knowledge of natural history.<br> If wind and tide had been against us,<br> I should have said yes.<br> They're not. Im obliged to say no.<br> Oh, I see.<br> So after all this time in your service,<br> I must simply content myself<br> to form part of this belligerent expedition,<br> hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.<br> I say nothing of the corruption of power...<br> - You forget yourself, Doctor.<br> - No, Jack, no.<br> You've forgotten yourself. For my part,<br> I look upon a promise as binding.<br> The promise was conditional.<br> I command a king's ship, not a private yacht!<br> We do not have time for<br> your damned hobbies, sir!<br> All right. All right.<br> Get those fish below.<br> Sluice down this deck.<br> Davies, don't leave them there.<br> Get them below.<br> Mr Blakeney.<br> Sir, I found a curious beetle<br> walking along the deck.<br> I think it's a Galpagos beetle.<br> Im sure of it.<br> Were you to walk all day on the island,<br> you might never come across it.<br> Yes, that is more than likely sure.<br> You can have it, sir.<br> Mr Blakeney.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Sir.<br> Last gun fired, sir.<br> - Timing?<br> - Two minutes and one second, sir.<br> Lads, that's not good enough.<br> We need to fire two broadsides to her one.<br> - Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?<br> - No!<br> - Do you want to call Napoleon your king?<br> - No!<br> - Want your children to sing The Marseillaise?<br> - No!<br> Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery!<br> Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.<br> - Mark your targets!<br> - Come on, lads, faster now!<br> Come on, swab it!<br> Heave!<br> - Report, Mr Mowett.<br> - Third and fourth divisions ready.<br> Right. Starboard battery, fire!<br> One minute and ten seconds!<br> Huzzah!<br> Well done, lads.<br> Extra grog for all of you.<br> Huzzah!<br> Gangway for the captain, lads.<br> Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Killick! Killick there!<br> What do you have for us tonight?<br> - Which it's soused hog's face.<br> - Eh?<br> - Which it is soused hog's face!<br> - My favourite. My favourite.<br> And when they run,<br> the Surprise will blow her to kingdom come!<br> One more week of this and<br> they'd give it up for a cup of water.<br> I can't make it rain.<br> I can harness the wind,<br> but I ain't its goddamn creator.<br> I have never known such a run of bad luck.<br> "And they said unto him<br> 'For what caused the evil?"'<br> Where'd that come from?<br> It's from the Bible, that. That is<br> from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.<br> They found out on their ship<br> that one of their men - this Jonah cove -<br> he'd offended God<br> and was the cause of all their bad luck.<br> Evil comes... from him<br> who evil thinks and evil is.<br> - No, no. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.<br> From personal experience. Right, Joe?<br> It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,<br> he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.<br> Then his entire gun crew's killed.<br> Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.<br> And whose watch was it<br> when we lost our wind?<br> You there! Stand fast!<br> Master-at-arms, take that man below<br> and clap him in irons.<br> Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Bring Hollom down to my cabin.<br> A man pushed past you,<br> yet you said nothing. Why?<br> I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...<br> The right words?<br> He was deliberately insubordinate.<br> Ive tried to get to know the men, sir,<br> and be friendly,<br> but they've taken a set against me.<br> Always whispering when I go past<br> and giving me looks.<br> Ill set that to rights.<br> Ill be much tougher on them.<br> You don't make friends<br> with the foremast jacks, lad.<br> They'll despise you in the end,<br> think you weak.<br> - Nor do you need to be a tyrant.<br> - No, sir.<br> Im very sorry, sir.<br> - You're, what? 26, 27?<br> - Im 30 next Friday, sir.<br> You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.<br> I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.<br> You can't spend your life a midshipman.<br> No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.<br> Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.<br> Strength.<br> Now, you find that within yourself,<br> and you will earn their respect.<br> Without respect,<br> true discipline goes by the board.<br> Yes, sir. Um...<br> Strength, respect... and discipline, sir.<br> Well... it's an unfortunate business, Hollom.<br> Damned unfortunate.<br> - That'll be all.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I am not a flogging captain.<br> - Hollom is a scapegoat<br> for all the bad luck,<br> real or imagined, on this voyage.<br> Mr Lamb? If you please.<br> They're exhausted.<br> These men are exhausted.<br> You've pushed them too hard.<br> Stephen, I invite you<br> to this cabin as my friend.<br> Not to criticise nor to comment<br> on my command.<br> Well, shall I leave you until<br> you're in a more harmonious frame of mind?<br> - What would you have me do?<br> - Tip the ship's grog over the side.<br> - Stop their grog?<br> - Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.<br> Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.<br> Id rather have them three sheets to the wind<br> than face a mutiny.<br> Im rather understanding of mutinies.<br> Men pressed from their homes, confined<br> for months aboard a wooden prison...<br> I respect your right to disagree with me,<br> but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.<br> I hate it when you talk of the service<br> in this way. It makes me so very low.<br> You think I want to flog Nagle?<br> A man who hacked the ropes<br> that sent his mate to his death?<br> Under my orders?<br> Do you not see? The only things that keep<br> this wooden world together are hard work...<br> Jack, the man failed to salute.<br> There's hierarchies even in nature.<br> - There is no disdain in nature. There is no...<br> - Men must be governed!<br> Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.<br> That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,<br> from Nero to Bonaparte.<br> I, for one, am opposed to authority.<br> It is an egg of misery and oppression.<br> You've come to the wrong shop<br> for anarchy, brother.<br> Four.<br> Five.<br> Six.<br> Seven.<br> Eight.<br> Nine.<br> Ten.<br> Eleven.<br> Twelve.<br> Cut him down.<br> Shh. Not so loud.<br> Oh, put that dirk down, Boyle.<br> - You OK, Mr Hollom?<br> - He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.<br> - Shut up!<br> - You shut up.<br> - Just leave him be.<br> - Have some water.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Sir. Sir, it's Mr Hollom.<br> There's nothing physically wrong with him.<br> He thinks he's been cursed.<br> Sailors can abide a great deal,<br> but not a Jonah.<br> My God. You believe it too.<br> Not everything is in your books, Stephen.<br> It's him, innit?<br> The Jonah.<br> He's causing it.<br> He's callin' it up, don't you see?<br> Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.<br> You wait and see.<br> Any time tonight,<br> that ghost ship's gonna turn up.<br> And it's gonna take us all with it,<br> straight down to the hot place.<br> Mr Hollom.<br> You gave me such a start.<br> Are you feeling better now?<br> Yes. Much better, thank you.<br> The captain thinks<br> we'll get our wind tomorrow.<br> Im sure of it.<br> You've always been very kind to me.<br> Goodbye, Blakeney.<br> The simple truth is, not all of us become<br> the men we once hoped we might be.<br> But we are all God's creatures.<br> If there are those among us<br> who thought ill of Mr Hollom,<br> or spoke ill of him,<br> or failed him in respect of fellowship...<br> then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.<br> And we ask for his.<br> God be praised. Mr Mowett?<br> Avast there!<br> - Doctor, have you seen the bird?<br> - What sort of bird?<br> Some sort of albatross. Either that, or<br> he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.<br> There he is. My bird, my bird. Damn!<br> - It's circling, lads!<br> Doctor?<br> My God! Doctor! Doctor!<br> Im so sorry, man.<br> The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.<br> - Calamy, get Higgins.<br> - Im fine, Jack.<br> The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.<br> Unless it's removed,<br> it's gonna suppurate and fester.<br> Are you equal to the task?<br> Well, Ill need to read up on the doctor's<br> books, like. Study some pictures he has.<br> Study some pictures?<br> It's just to get my bearings, that's all.<br> Well, it'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.<br> You know, you wouldn't have the...<br> Ill manage. You'll see.<br> Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.<br> We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.<br> Better get...<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.<br> Shall we beat to quarters, sir?<br> Tell me this wasn't on my account.<br> No, not at all.<br> I just needed to stretch my legs.<br> Gently there.<br> Briskly now. Secure this line.<br> Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.<br> - All set, Higgins?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> No.<br> I do this with my own hand.<br> If everything is under control,<br> Ill just be outside.<br> A spare pair of steady hands<br> wouldn't go amiss.<br> That is, if, of course, you have<br> the constitution for this kind of thing.<br> My dear doctor, I have been amongst<br> and around wounds all my life.<br> Well, good, then.<br> Put your hand on my belly,<br> pressing firmly when I give the word.<br> Higgins, the catling, if you please.<br> Padeen, please.<br> The sounder, Mr Higgins.<br> Swab.<br> All right.<br> Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.<br> Take a good grip... with the square retractor.<br> Right in.<br> And lift up.<br> Lift up.<br> Swab, Jack. I can't see.<br> Are you all right?<br> I got it.<br> A tad more pressure.<br> - Is that all of it?<br> - Aye, sir.<br> She'll patch up nicely.<br> Thank God I got it.<br> Oh, that's good.<br> Sir! Sir!<br> - Padeen and I have been collecting for you.<br> - Have you really?<br> The beetles each come with a specimen<br> of the plant they were found on.<br> Padeen, that one's got away.<br> Sir, Ive made a few notes,<br> if you want to see them.<br> Mr Blakeney, it would appear that<br> you have the makings of a naturalist.<br> Well, sir, perhaps I could combine them to be<br> a sort of... fighting naturalist, like you, sir.<br> They don't combine too well, I find.<br> Right.<br> Should you really be getting up, sir?<br> - Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?<br> - No, sir.<br> No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.<br> How long does the captain<br> intend that we stay? Do you know?<br> - Oh, a week perhaps.<br> - A week?<br> - There's no great hurry.<br> - Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?<br> Im not even sure<br> it was the Acheron we sighted.<br> And if it was, she'll be well away by now.<br> Like looking for an honest man in parliament.<br> No, we shall head home. Before peace<br> breaks out with France, God forbid.<br> I fear you may have burdened me<br> with a debt I can never repay.<br> Tosh. Name a shrub after me.<br> Something prickly and hard to eradicate.<br> A shrub? Nonsense.<br> Ill name a great tortoise after you.<br> Testudo aubreii.<br> Come on, pack up your things.<br> We should be going.<br> - Back to camp, sir?<br> - No, to the other side of the island.<br> - But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.<br> - Then there's not a moment to lose.<br> That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.<br> Come on.<br> Seven inches in length.<br> Four inches wide.<br> Width at the widest point... six inches.<br> Padeen, put the net down<br> and use your hands. They won't bite.<br> Here's a good one.<br> Pick them up carefully.<br> Sir, I think we should be getting back.<br> Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,<br> Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.<br> And should it indeed prove flightless,<br> you can join me at the Royal Society dinner<br> as co-discoverer.<br> Mr Blakeney.<br> Sir, we must hurry.<br> Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.<br> Leave them. Just put everything down.<br> Open the cages.<br> - All hands, unmoor ship!<br> - Mr Allen, Ill have her on a starboard tack.<br> Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.<br> Barret Bonden,<br> put your helm hard to starboard.<br> He has a head start of two hours on us<br> and he's bearing south.<br> That can only mean King Charles Island.<br> He's looking for water.<br> If we caught up with her, I mean, to take her...<br> we'd have to be bloody invisible.<br> Brace the yards to starboard!<br> So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?<br> No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.<br> No, my greatest discovery<br> was your phantom.<br> Indeed it was. Im sorry you had to leave<br> the majority of your collection behind.<br> In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I<br> did make one... very interesting find.<br> Is that right?<br> Let me guess. A stick?<br> Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.<br> - It's a rare phasmid, sir.<br> - A phasmid?<br> It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick<br> in order to confuse its predators.<br> A nautical phasmid, Doctor.<br> At least, to a hungry eye,<br> if one has an appetite for whalers.<br> I intend to take a greater interest<br> in the bounty of nature from now on.<br> I had no idea that a study of nature<br> could advance the art of naval warfare.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Now to pull this predator in close<br> and spring our trap.<br> - Jack?<br> - Yes.<br> You're the predator.<br> There. Hull-down,<br> broad off the larboard bow.<br> That's a frigate, all right.<br> Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.<br> - Mr Allen! More smoke.<br> - Aye, sir!<br> That'll bring 'em about.<br> That's it, lads. Clean 'em up<br> so they fly straight and true.<br> Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.<br> Larboard battery,<br> unship your rear wheels.<br> Drop the gun.<br> - Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.<br> - Oh, God!<br> - Tom?<br> - Our preparations are completed, sir.<br> Good. Right, from now on<br> no "sirs", no salutes, no whistles, no bells.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Yes, I think we're all<br> finding that quite difficult.<br> There'll be 30 or more whalers<br> locked in the Acheron's hold.<br> After we board, Mr Calamy<br> should take a party and free them.<br> - You think him ready, sir?<br> - Were you ready, Tom?<br> - He may well turn the tide.<br> - Indeed, sir.<br> She's taken the bait. Let's come about.<br> Make a show of fleeing, panicky<br> and disorganised, like a whaler might.<br> Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.<br> Hurry up, or they'll see you.<br> Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick<br> and get some whaler's slops on.<br> - Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I hear we're to free the whalers.<br> - You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.<br> Im sorry, Will.<br> Make a bad show of keeping your course.<br> Let her run up and luff every now and then.<br> - Excuse me, sir.<br> - Remove your hat. We're whalers.<br> Mr Calamy says Im not<br> on the boarding party. I wanted to say...<br> I know what you want to say.<br> And my answer is no.<br> You'll lead your gun crew, then when<br> we board, you'll take command of the ship.<br> - Do I make myself clear?<br> - Take command of the ship... Thank you, sir.<br> - Back to your station.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> On your right upper arm,<br> to tell friend from foe!<br> Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.<br> - Is that the arm you got or don't got?<br> - Less of that cheek, Davies.<br> Take your neck cloths<br> and put them round your right upper arm.<br> Make way for the captain.<br> Congratulations, Lieutenant.<br> Right, lads.<br> I know there's not a faint heart among you,<br> and I know you're as anxious as I am<br> to get into close action.<br> But we must bring him right up beside us<br> before we spring this trap.<br> That will test our nerve.<br> And discipline will count<br> just as much as courage.<br> The Acheron is a tough nut to crack.<br> More than twice our guns and numbers.<br> And they will sell their lives dearly.<br> Topmen, your handling of the sheets<br> to be lubberly and un-navylike,<br> until the signal<br> to spill the wind from our sails.<br> This will bring us almost to a complete stop.<br> Gun crews, you must run out and tie down<br> in double-quick time.<br> With the rear wheels removed you've gained<br> elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.<br> So, gun captains, that gives you one shot<br> from the larboard battery. One shot only.<br> You'll fire for her mainmast.<br> Much will depend on your accuracy.<br> However, even crippled she will still<br> be dangerous, like a wounded beast.<br> Captain Howard and the marines<br> will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun<br> and musket fire from the tops.<br> They'll try and even the odds for us<br> before we board.<br> They mean to take us as a prize.<br> And we are worth more to them undamaged.<br> Their greed... will be their downfall.<br> England is under threat of invasion.<br> And though we be on the far side<br> of the world, this ship is our home.<br> This ship is England.<br> So it's every hand to his rope or gun.<br> Quick's the word and sharp's the action.<br> After all, surprise is on our side.<br> Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!<br> - Toss them high so they can see them.<br> - Hello, Doctor.<br> Jack.<br> - Care for a cigar?<br> - Thank you, no.<br> If you please, Doctor.<br> - I took the liberty, Doctor.<br> - Thank you, Killick.<br> - There's three lumps in there.<br> - How kind.<br> - Good luck, Will.<br> - Good luck, Peter.<br> - See you afterwards.<br> - And you.<br> Steady now, lads. Keep calm.<br> English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.<br> - Barret.<br> - Sir.<br> You have no possibility, no chance.<br> But you have had warning.<br> Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.<br> English whaler, this is your last warning.<br> Stop now, or we will destroy you.<br> - Let fly!<br> - Let fly!<br> - Haul your yards there!<br> - C'est un navire de guerre!<br> Run out, boys!<br> Fire!<br> Fire!<br> For the mainmast, lads!<br> - Let me through.<br> - Fire!<br> Huzzah!<br> Hard a-larboard!<br> Right the headsails! Set the topsails!<br> Heave!<br> Man the starboard battery!<br> Fire as she bears!<br> Get to it! Get to it!<br> It's the fallen mast! We can't lay alongside.<br> Cross the wreckage as best you can.<br> Ill draw their fire.<br> - My division to join Mr Pullings!<br> - Clew up topsails!<br> - Huzzah for Lucky Jack!<br> - Huzzah!<br> Grappling hooks away!<br> Run out the boarding planks!<br> - My division, follow me!<br> - For England, for home, and for the prize!<br> Here we go, lads!<br> Pipe down. Silence.<br> Looks like the job is done, sir.<br> Acheron!<br> Fire!<br> Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder!<br> That's it!<br> Fire!<br> Keep moving, men! Keep moving!<br> Joe!<br> Grenades, ready!<br> They're aiming for our hull!<br> They could sink us! Depress the muzzle!<br> Padeen, train it aft!<br> Together now!<br> Stand clear!<br> Fire!<br> Arm yourselves! We must board them!<br> Follow me!<br> Now!<br> Whalers, follow me!<br> Mr Hogg, down below! Quickly now!<br> Albatrosses! Albatrosses, do you hear me?<br> To the guns! To the guns!<br> Boyle, douse that gun's priming!<br> Lively there! Come on! Move!<br> Now do your worst!<br> Non! Non! Non!<br> - Mr Howard.<br> - Sir.<br> - Have they struck their colours?<br> - I believe so.<br> - Has their captain been sighted?<br> - Not yet, sir.<br> - Carry on.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Le capitaine?<br> - L'infirmerie.<br> Docteur? Docteur?<br> Oui.<br> Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.<br> I did what I could for him.<br> Before the capitaine died...<br> he said I was to give you this.<br> No. Ill do it.<br> Can you help me?<br> Our Father,<br> who art in heaven,<br> hallowed be thy name.<br> Thy kingdom come,<br> thy will be done,<br> on earth as it is in heaven.<br> Give us this day our daily bread,<br> and forgive us our trespasses,<br> as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br> And lead us not into temptation,<br> but deliver us from evil.<br> For thine is the kingdom,<br> the power and the glory,<br> forever and ever.<br> Amen.<br> Robert Gardner, able seaman.<br> James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.<br> Robert Kemp, able seaman.<br> John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.<br> Michael Doudle, able seaman.<br> Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.<br> John Allen, sailing master.<br> Peter Miles Calamy...<br> lieutenant.<br> We therefore commit<br> their bodies to the deep,<br> to be turned into corruption,<br> looking for the resurrection of the body<br> when the sea shall give up her dead,<br> and the life of the world to come,<br> through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br> Amen.<br> It's our old friend.<br> Pass down a barrel of paint, please.<br> Sir, the whalers are all aboard<br> and that's the last detachment of marines.<br> Good, good.<br> I think I shall return to the Galpagos.<br> Take on food and water and give<br> the doctor a few days to find his bird.<br> Very good, sir.<br> You, however,<br> shall take the Acheron south to Valparaiso.<br> Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,<br> and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.<br> I believe Mr Hogg<br> would be a good choice for sailing master.<br> However, that will be your decision,<br> Captain Pullings.<br> Your orders.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Godspeed, Tom.<br> And to you, sir.<br> - Mr Mowett?<br> - With pleasure, sir.<br> - Good luck.<br> - See you in Portsmouth.<br> Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings!<br> - Hip, hip...<br> - Huzzah!<br> - Hip, hip...<br> - Huzzah!<br> - Hip, hip...<br> - Huzzah!<br> - Good luck, sir.<br> - Good luck, Captain.<br> Oh, here we go again.<br> Killick! Killick there!<br> Which it will be ready when it's ready!<br> Ill rest easier when I know<br> they've reached shore.<br> So many wounded, and only that poor<br> unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.<br> Still, he's better than no doctor at all.<br> - I met their doctor. I spoke to him.<br> - No, he died of fever months ago.<br> - De Vigny?<br> - Mm.<br> Ah.<br> - Pass the word for Mr Mowett.<br> - Mr Mowett to the great cabin.<br> Their "doctor" gave me this sword.<br> Sir.<br> Mr Mowett, change of course.<br> Southeast by east.<br> We'll intercept the Acheron<br> and escort them into Valparaiso.<br> Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.<br> - And William...<br> - Sir?<br> - Beat to quarters.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Subject to the requirements of the service.<br> Ah.<br> Well, Stephen... the bird's flightless?<br> Yes.<br> It's not going anywhere.<br> 2004<br>
