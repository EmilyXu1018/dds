I'm really pleased<br> he's going to inherit that $156 million,<br> is that right?<br> I hope that when he gets the dough<br> he remembers that<br> he owes the Rockwood Dairy $4,500.<br> [Man] What kind of a guy<br> was Melvin to work with?<br> [Jim] He was a fine man... uh...<br> A good worker. Matter of fact,<br> he was Milkman of the Month.<br> - Two bucks.<br> - You remember me, Melvin?<br> - Huh?<br> - I was with you.

How's Darcy?<br> Oh, wow, Melvin. She is so proud.<br> Yeah? Hey, that's all right. Listen...<br> She's not having any trouble<br> at school because of this, is she?<br> No, no, don't worry about it.<br> Melvin...<br> - Howard Hughes, huh?<br> - What do you think about that?<br> - [Lynda] I think it's amazing.<br> - Listen, I gotta go.<br> - Say hi to the kids.<br> - Goodbye, Melvin.<br> Goodbye, Lynda.<br> [Man] Why did you deliver<br> the will to the church?<br> - What were you scared of?<br> - [Melvin] What might be inside.<br> Why was that frightening?<br> I don't know.<br> Can you give me one reason on earth<br> why this strange man would leave<br> that will with you, Melvin Dummar?<br> Well, I don't know. I've been<br> trying to figure that out myself.<br> [Laughter]<br> - [Lawyer] Did you find an answer?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> Isn't it true you can't find an answer<br> because it never happened that way?<br> Please, stand up. Face the judge.<br> Place your hand on the bible.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear in the name of God<br> that this story about<br> how you received this will is true?<br> I do.<br> Well, Melvin, if it meant...<br> ...eternal damnation in hell, would<br> you still say it happened that way?<br> It's the truth.<br> Of course I would say that.<br> [Courtroom murmurs]<br> Melvin, turn your chair around<br> and face me, please.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Melvin, are you lying?<br> - No, sir.<br> I want you to know that...<br> ...there is a still, small voice<br> that many people are blessed with,<br> that tells them<br> when the truth is being spoken.<br> It's been said,<br> "What doth it profit a man<br> if he gain the whole world<br> yet lose his soul?"<br> Now, if you're lying, Melvin,<br> which you are in my opinion,<br> your soul may be in jeopardy but that's<br> not really what I'm concerned with now.<br> I'm concerned with your hide.<br> Because if I find that<br> you're lying before this court,<br> I'll make it a special duty<br> to have a piece of your hide.<br> I'll direct the District Attorney to<br> bring a criminal case against you.<br> And I'll make it my special project<br> that if you're convicted,<br> I will recommend<br> that you do time in prison.<br> And I want you to know<br> Nevada State Prison's no country club,<br> like Gabbs local jail<br> or wherever it was you served time.<br> If you're lying, you go straight<br> to Nevada State Prison.<br> All right, Melvin?<br> You bet.<br> Your Honour.<br> [Sighs]<br> Brother Dummar...<br> I want the truth.<br> Where did this so-called will come from?<br> It... uh... Some man brought it<br> by the station where I was working.<br> He left it there.<br> Are you gonna persist in giving the<br> answers elicited from you this morning?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Do you know who wrote the will?<br> No, I don't<br> Did you in any way participate<br> in the preparation of the will?<br> No, sir.<br> I've done my best, gentlemen.<br> [Courtroom murmurs]<br> Melvin, you did it. On July 6,<br> they determine the validity of the will.<br> Like he says,<br> it's the only will we got.<br> With the testimony<br> by handwriting experts,<br> the will's gonna be admitted to<br> probate. You'll get your inheritance.<br> - You think so?<br> - It's gonna be a long road.<br> But we won the first battle, I can tell.<br> The T-shirt people called again.<br> Look, they're worth an easy 15,000.<br> What do you say?<br> No, I don't think so, man.<br> You can use the cash.<br> What's the matter, you want to get paid?<br> No... They started paving the freeway<br> down from the gas station.<br> - In two weeks, you'll be Ionely there.<br> - Don't worry, I'll be all right.<br> - You won, Mel!<br> - What are you so worried about?<br> I just hope you don't<br> have any illusions.<br> They'll fight in every court they can,<br> the relatives, Summa...<br> Meanwhile, the government<br> will take out taxes, the state...<br> Lawyers'll take legal fees.<br> Money's gonna be siphoned off.<br> Yeah, listen, I've known that<br> since I first found that will.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, you think that Melvin Dummar<br> is gonna get $156 million?<br> Or anything like it?<br> Nah, I'm not gonna see that money.<br> That's all right.<br> Cos you know what happened?<br> Howard Hughes<br> sang Melvin Dummar's song.<br> That's what happened.<br> He sang it.<br> He was funny.<br> Yeah, he sang it.<br> Santa's Souped-Up Sleigh.<br> I'll see you.<br> [Melvin] Sorry.<br> That's OK.<br> Gave me a chance to get 'em fed.<br> Sure you wanna do this?<br> Are you kidding? See my kids,<br> up there in the fresh air? Oh, yeah.<br> Go on the back seat. I got some<br> comic books and a little toy for Farron.<br> You're not gonna hassle me when I want<br> them back at the end of the summer?<br> You got my word.<br> - That's what I'm afraid of.<br> - Aww, come on.<br> Bonnie sure is gonna have<br> her hands full this summer.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Give us a kiss.<br> [Darcy] Bye, Mom!<br> Don't wake him up.<br> I'll try not to.<br> How about lettin' me drive?<br> - You?<br> - I'm a darned good driver.<br> You haven't driven<br> since they put out the Hudson.<br> I'm a darned good driver, I'll bet you.<br> All right.<br> When we get into Vegas, though,<br> I'm gonna run it in.<br> Slide over.<br>
