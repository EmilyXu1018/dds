                        Michael.<br> Dear Michael. Of course it's you.<br> Who else could they send?<br> Who else could be trusted?<br> And I know it's a long way<br> and you're ready to go to work.<br> All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just...<br> Just please hear me out.<br> Because this is not an episode,<br> relapse, fuckup.<br> I'm begging you, Michael,<br> I'm begging you.<br> Try and make believe<br> this is not just madness...<br> ... because this is not just madness.<br> Two weeks ago,<br> I came out of the building, okay?<br> I'm running across 6th Avenue,<br> there's a car waiting...<br> ... I got exactly 38 minutes to get<br> to the airport, and I'm dictating.<br> There's this panicked associate<br> sprinting along beside me...<br> ... scribbling in a notepad,<br> and she starts screaming.<br> And I realize we're standing<br> in the middle of the street...<br> ... the light's changed and there's this wall<br> of serious traffic speeding towards us.<br> And I freeze. I can't move.<br> I'm suddenly consumed<br> with the overwhelming sensation...<br> ... that I'm covered<br> with some sort of film.<br> And it's in my hair, in my face.<br> And it's like a glaze, like a coating.<br> And at first I thought,<br> "Oh, my God, I know what this is.<br> This is some sort of amniotic,<br> embryonic fluid.<br> I'm drenched in afterbirth.<br> I've breached the chrysalis.<br> I've been reborn. "<br> But then, the traffic, the stampede,<br> the cars, the trucks, the horns...<br> ... this poor woman screaming,<br> and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.<br> This is some kind of giddy illusion<br> of renewal...<br> ... that happens in<br> the final moment before death. "<br> And then I realize,<br> "No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...<br> ... because I looked back<br> at the building...<br> ... and I had the most stunning<br> moment of clarity.<br> I realized, Michael...<br> ... that I had emerged, not through<br> the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...<br> ... not through the portals<br> of our vast and powerful law firm...<br> ... but from the asshole of an organism...<br> ... whose sole function is<br> to excrete the poison...<br> ... the ammo, the defoliant necessary<br> for other larger...<br> ... more powerful organisms<br> to destroy the miracle of humanity.<br> And that I had been coated<br> in this patina of shit...<br> ... for the best part of my life.<br> And the stench of it, the stain of it<br> would take the rest of my life to undo.<br> And you know what I did?<br> I took a deep, cleansing breath<br> and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.<br> I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,<br> as potent a feeling as this is...<br> ... as true a thing as I believe<br> that I have witnessed today, it must wait.<br> It must stand the test of time. "<br> And, Michael, the time is now.<br> I'm not sure what else I can tell you<br> that I haven't already.<br> Tell me about U/North, Barry.<br> They're your clients.<br> So you tell me why you're settling<br> a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.<br> Because I'm writing this story<br> whether you like it or not.<br> What does that exactly mean?<br> Give me something I can print.<br> We found 97.<br> I've got that cunt from<br> The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.<br> She will not go away.<br> Marty Bach. How can I help you?<br> Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.<br> We're going with a story tomorrow...<br> ... about a settlement in the U/North<br> defoliant case. You wanna comment?<br> Case you're referring to is now,<br> as it has been for the past six years...<br> ...pending and unresolved.<br> Till such time as our client<br> has their day in court...<br> ...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,<br> I'll have nothing of value to tell you.<br> Come on, Marty, you're closing<br> the U/North case. You're settling.<br> I know that. I know you're up there with<br> 600 people jamming this thing through.<br> Here's what I know.<br> Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.<br> So you're fishing for a story or<br> trying to get out of writing a retraction.<br> In either case,<br> I wish you the best of luck.<br> Where the fuck is Karen crowder?<br> I'll see the turn.<br> Check.<br> Check.<br> Check.<br> Half the pot. Two hundred.<br> Two hundred to go.<br> You don't remember me, huh?<br> We played together a couple times.<br> That lamp place on Bowery.<br> That guy's showroom?<br> All the lamps and shit?<br> - The Galaxy.<br> - That's it.<br> You had a restaurant<br> you were opening, right?<br> My old partner bid that job,<br> the plumbing.<br> - You don't remember me?<br> - I remember you.<br> Because I lost a lot of weight since then.<br> You bought some hair too.<br> With your money.<br> So, what happened with the bar?<br> You just had to be a rock star, huh?<br> Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,<br> I go home and put the fucking Tv on.<br> That was a good location.<br> Yeah, that's what my partner<br> kept telling me.<br> Action's on you.<br> I bet the pot.<br> Good to see you again.<br> Hello?<br> - Michael.<br> - Walter.<br> Michael, thank God, there you are.<br> Look, I got a situation.<br> A big problem, all right? A client of mine,<br> he just called, he hit a guy with his car.<br> He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.<br> Just now?<br> Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.<br> He's driving home.<br> He's home now. He's there waiting.<br> Where?<br> Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.<br> He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.<br> Is he drunk?<br> No. It's the first thing I asked him.<br> He's good, he's sober.<br> Tell him to stay off the phone.<br> All right. But you're on it?<br> You can get up there?<br> Because this guy, he's a huge client.<br> This is half my book, this guy, okay?<br> I'm walking to the car now.<br> Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back<br> and I'll get the address.<br> Just let me know you're on the way,<br> and I'll get back to you with the details.<br> All right. I'll be in the car.<br> What they did, see,<br> they changed the grade there.<br> They widened the street.<br> I'm sure somebody told them<br> that that was an improvement.<br> But now, you see, when it rains and when<br> there is fog, and with this new angle...<br> ...and they've got these new...<br> These... These...<br> These sodium lamps, it's blinding.<br> - That corner there. It is blinding.<br> - They'll have to work that out.<br> And it's not just tonight.<br> I've been saying this for years.<br> I mean, how many times have we talked<br> about that corner? Dell?<br> Mr. Greer, we don't have<br> a lot of time here.<br> So the circumstances, the road conditions,<br> none of this holds any interest for you?<br> What interests me is finding<br> the strongest criminal attorney...<br> ...that can be here in 15 minutes.<br> Well, that sounds ominous.<br> We have some good relationships<br> up here in westchester.<br> So, what are you? What are you?<br> You're not a lawyer?<br> - Not the kind you need.<br> - What kind is that?<br> A trial lawyer.<br> Somebody who can see this through.<br> That's not what I do.<br> Okay. I think we're gonna have to<br> pull walter back in on this.<br> I wanna get walter back on the phone,<br> get him back into the mix.<br> Because, I'll be frank with you,<br> I don't like the way this is going.<br> Sir, we don't have time for walter.<br> Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.<br> What options?<br> I'm not hearing any options!<br> I suggest you go local...<br> ...and I'm telling you there are<br> people here I like for this.<br> Great. That's it?<br> That's what you got for me?<br> Hey, you believe this?<br> I have been a client at Kenner, Bach<br> for 12 years!<br> You think I paid that retainer every month<br> for a place at the back of the line?<br> Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident<br> on a slow weeknight...<br> ...six miles from<br> the state police barracks.<br> If there's a line,<br> you're right up front.<br> I can get a lawyer any time I want.<br> I don't need you for that.<br> We're not sitting here for 45 minutes<br> waiting for a goddamn referral!<br> I don't know what walter<br> promised you...<br> A miracle worker! That's walter<br> on the phone, 20 minutes ago.<br> Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.<br> I'm sending you a miracle worker."<br> - Well, he misspoke.<br> - About what?<br> That you're the firm's fixer?<br> Or that you're good at it?<br> Elliot.<br> The guy was running! In the street!<br> You take that, you add the fog,<br> you add the lamps, you add the angle...<br> what the fuck is he doing running in<br> the middle of the street at midnight?!<br> You answer me that!<br> What if someone had stolen the car?<br> Happens all the time.<br> Cops like hit-and-runs.<br> They work them hard,<br> they clear them fast.<br> Right now there's a B.c.I. Unit<br> pulling paint chips off a guard rail.<br> Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking<br> for the owner of a custom-painted...<br> ...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.<br> And the guy you hit?<br> If he got a look at the plates,<br> it won't even take that long.<br> There's no play here.<br> There's no angle.<br> There's no champagne room.<br> I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.<br> The math on this is simple.<br> The smaller the mess,<br> the easier it is for me to clean up.<br> That's the police, isn't it?<br> No.<br> They don't call.<br> Hello.<br> Jerry, it's Michael clayton.<br> Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.<br> No. I'm in the neighborhood.<br> You got a pen?<br> Mom, where's my cards?<br> Where's my cards?<br> Is my other deck in here?<br> Did you eat?<br> Dad's down there waiting already.<br> There were cards in our bathroom.<br> Yes, I had a waffle.<br> Since we're out of waffles,<br> I don't see how that's possible.<br> It's a miracle.<br> Gloves?<br> Henry!<br> Come on.<br> Get in.<br> Got it?<br> So no one's even sure<br> exactly where they are...<br> ...because there's no borders<br> or landmarks or anything.<br> And the town?<br> It's not even a town really.<br> It just is this camp where all these people<br> have gathered to hide.<br> Right.<br> All these deserters and guys<br> that got cut off from their armies.<br> All these people that are hiding<br> in the woods, trying to stay alive.<br> This is where they all came.<br> There's Thieves, Gray Mages,<br> Unbidden warriors...<br> ...Dark Avians,<br> Riverwynders and Sappers.<br> - There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> And nobody has any alliances.<br> You can't even say who you are<br> because, you don't know...<br> ...maybe the person you're talking to...<br> ...maybe they're like your mortal enemy<br> in the wars.<br> So it's just completely like<br> everybody for themselves.<br> Sounds familiar.<br> It's really good.<br> I'm serious, you should really read it.<br> Right. But by the time I finish it,<br> you'll be on to something else.<br> - How much you wanna bet?<br> - I don't know. How much you got?<br> - You got your bus pass?<br> - It's in my locker.<br> You're not even gonna look at it,<br> are you?<br> - The book?<br> - Yes.<br> Bring it on Saturday, I'II...<br> I did already. I left it in your kitchen.<br> It's got a red cover.<br> Okay.<br> Well, here we go.<br> Go. Teach these people something,<br> would you?<br> - See you later, Dad.<br> - Yeah, kiddo.<br> Thanks.<br> Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,<br> assorted sizes.<br> Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.<br> Thirty dollars I have.<br> You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.<br> Sixty dollars back there.<br> Sixty dollars, get me to 70.<br> I got 70 dollars.<br> Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.<br> Eighty dollars there.<br> Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.<br> Eighty dollars.<br> Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.<br> One hundred I have now.<br> He says you're still gonna be short.<br> How short?<br> Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.<br> - That's liquor and everything?<br> - What'd you think it was gonna be?<br> I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.<br> He took 1500 on a refrigerator<br> I paid four grand for.<br> Make a bid.<br> Are you telling me you don't have<br> the 75 thousand?<br> Just lying around, no.<br> We both know it's your brother<br> I should be talking to.<br> Forget that.<br> Michael, look, you wanna front this,<br> that's up to you.<br> But Timmy's name stays in the book<br> till we're clear.<br> If I know where he is,<br> I don't have to keep asking.<br> He's upstate. His wife took him back.<br> I don't know where he is.<br> He's gotta have something.<br> He's got the two kids with her.<br> He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress<br> that he knocked up.<br> He's got four Michelin radials<br> that he stole from my sister's garage.<br> Make an offer.<br> I had a wife who was a drunk.<br> She was a beautiful girl, young girl.<br> But live like that? Even they do a program...<br> She did, I think, once, two years.<br> And then they slip? Forget it.<br> It's like you're strapped to a bomb.<br> What's my timeframe here?<br> I don't know.<br> I didn't think it'd be a problem.<br> I'll ask.<br> - Hey, Michael.<br> - Morning, carl.<br> I don't know. Del, I don't know<br> how hard you want me to press here.<br> Let me know how brave he wants to be.<br> Well, I'm not sure how brave<br> he can be right now.<br> We just got a confirmation hearing<br> scheduled.<br> Any chance she knows that?<br> Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?<br> Maybe she got someone to read it to her.<br> She called his wife yesterday.<br> She's calling his house.<br> This is a total nightmare.<br> Well, my guess is<br> she's gonna want the condo.<br> Come on, that's insane.<br> Well, what can I tell you?<br> Don't piss off a motivated stripper.<br> It's just unbelievable.<br> All right. Well, find out his pain threshold<br> and get back to me.<br> Or you can tell him to call me directly.<br> All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.<br> Thanks.<br> Hey, where are we with Marty?<br> We left word.<br> Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?<br> He's not a kid. He's 22.<br> - This is Miami?<br> - Nope. Key Biscayne.<br> And they charged him.<br> Reckless endangerment. My client...<br> I think really what they want, they want<br> a reality check on the attorney down there.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Wayne said you have some connections?<br> - Yeah, let me get a pen.<br> - Thank you.<br> Now, if she calls the INS directly,<br> she's gonna get nowhere.<br> Even with the appointment?<br> It's retail, Evan.<br> It's like the DMv over there.<br> Unless they get a call from<br> a district supervisor, then nobody moves.<br> But your guy can do that?<br> He's a former commissioner.<br> None of this comes back to me?<br> Because that doesn't do any good.<br> No, look, I'm gonna be<br> the one that's asking.<br> - Can you hang on a minute?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Are we merging?<br> Marty Bach's in London.<br> They said he was in Atlanta,<br> then Lara said he was in the building.<br> So I called back.<br> I know you want this meeting.<br> Now she tells me the truth.<br> He's really in London.<br> So are we merging?<br> I mean, that's what everyone's saying.<br> All these Brits?<br> That this time it's for real.<br> Like I would know.<br> I don't know.<br> But even if we are, I mean, even if<br> they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?<br> Your phone's ringing.<br> Evan?<br> Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.<br> Let me give him a call<br> and set up a meeting for next week.<br> I'll walk her in,<br> I'll make the introduction...<br> At the moment,<br> U/North currently has 70,000 employees...<br> ... in 62 countries around the world.<br> Around the planet.<br> Operating in 62 countries<br> around the planet.<br> At work in more than 60 countries<br> around the globe.<br> We have... we have, right now...<br> we have...<br> At U/North right now,<br> we've got 75,000 employees...<br> ...in over 60 countries around the planet.<br> We are a very successful<br> and highly diversified company...<br> ...so you can imagine...<br> ...the volume and the variety<br> of legal issues we have to deal with is...<br> overwhelming.<br> It's just enormous.<br> So you can imagine,<br> the volume of legal issues...<br> It's quite substantial.<br> And as general counsel, what I do...<br> ...what our in-house department does...<br> ...is to analyze the dimension<br> of the problem or the opportunity...<br> ...to determine the jurisdiction...<br> ...and to outsource our business...<br> ...to those firms and talents<br> that we think can help us the most.<br> So with all that pressure and workload...<br> ... how do you keep a balance<br> between work and life?<br> Balance?<br> I think that's... That's something that...<br> ...you search for your whole life, isn't it?<br> It's a shifting balance, really.<br> It's, you know, you... You try to...<br> When you really are enjoying<br> what it is you do...<br> ...who needs balance?<br> There's your balance.<br> There's your balance.<br> When you're really enjoying<br> what it is you do, there is your balance.<br> When Don asked me to take...<br> when Don Jeffries brought...<br> Don Jeffries brought me...<br> Don Jeffries brought me in here<br> ...trusted me, mentored me.<br> Welcomed me into the U/North family.<br> And when he moved up to the boardroom,<br> I never really...<br> ...dreamt that I would have<br> the opportunity to move into his position.<br> But, is it challenging? Yes.<br> And I think that it's possible that those<br> first few months were a little shaky.<br> But then you realize that you've been<br> taught to be ready, and you take the helm.<br> Because if you're not comfortable<br> with that level of responsibility...<br> ...you're in the wrong place.<br> It's your department, your capacity to<br> make tough decisions in real time, and...<br> we're in the middle of an interview.<br> They said it was urgent.<br> Jesus.<br> For chrissake.<br> You're saying he did this in...?<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Barry.<br> - Hang on.<br> Arthur Edens just stripped down naked<br> in a deposition room in Milwaukee.<br> Oh, Michael...<br> ... I took a deep, cleansing breath<br> and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.<br> I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,<br> as potent a feeling as this is...<br> ... as true a thing as I believe<br> that I have witnessed today, it must wait.<br> It must stand the test of time. "<br> And, Michael, the time is now.<br> This moment, today,<br> here, this room, this air...<br> ... and this, especially this, Michael,<br> that you're here.<br> There's a reason.<br> A reason it's you, Michael.<br> Surely, you have some sense of that,<br> how it pulls together, how it gathers.<br> Nurse Michael, the secret hero,<br> the keeper of the hidden sins.<br> Tell me you can see that, Michael,<br> for God's sake.<br> But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.<br> The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.<br> It was... It was... It was a mistake.<br> It was wrong. It was lame.<br> It was obvious. And therapeutically,<br> it was completely useless...<br> ...because I swear, I could stand here<br> and tear off my fucking skin...<br> ...and I could not get down<br> to where this thing is living.<br> Six years, Michael.<br> Six years I've absorbed this poison.<br> Four hundred depositions,<br> a hundred motions, five changes of venue...<br> ...85,000 documents in discovery.<br> Six years of scheming and stalling<br> and screaming, and what have I got?<br> I've spent 12 percent of my life defending<br> the reputation of a deadly weed killer!<br> - We had an agreement, Arthur.<br> - One night.<br> One night, right?<br> I look up and there's Marty in my office.<br> He's got some champagne.<br> He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours<br> on U/North and he wants to celebrate.<br> So an hour later, I find myself<br> in a whorehouse in chelsea...<br> ...with two Lithuanian redheads<br> taking turns sucking my dick.<br> I'm laying there and I'm trying not<br> to come and I wanna...<br> I wanna make it last,<br> so I start doing the math.<br> I think, "Thirty thousand hours,<br> what is that? That's 24 times 30.<br> That's 720 hours in a month,<br> - Arthur.<br> - No, wait, wait, wait!<br> Because it's years! It's lives!<br> And the numbers are making me dizzy<br> and, you know...<br> ...now, instead of trying not to come,<br> I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.<br> I mean, is this me?<br> Am I this freak organism that has been<br> sent here to sleep and eat...<br> ...and defend this one horrific chain<br> of carcinogenic molecules?<br> Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?<br> - Listen, you promised me.<br> - Is that it, Michael?<br> Is that my grail?<br> Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?<br> Is that the correct answer<br> to the multiple choice of me?<br> You wanna go off your medication,<br> that's fine. But you call me first.<br> - That was our agreement.<br> - Sue me.<br> We okay in there?<br> We're fine. We're fine.<br> They killed them, Michael.<br> Those small farms, the family farms.<br> Did you...? Did you...?<br> Did you meet Anna?<br> No.<br> You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.<br> She's a miracle, Michael.<br> She's God's perfect little creature.<br> And for 50 million dollars in fees,<br> I've spent 12 percent of my life...<br> ...destroying perfect Anna<br> and her dead parents and her dying brother.<br> When did you last take one of these?<br> No. I'm not losing this.<br> Everything is finally significant.<br> The world is a beautiful place.<br> I'm not trading that.<br> - Lf it's real, the pill won't kill it.<br> - I have blood on my hands.<br> You are senior litigating partner<br> of one of the largest...<br> ...most respected law firms in the world.<br> You are a legend.<br> - I'm an accomplice!<br> - You're a manic-depressive.<br> I am Shiva, the god of death.<br> Let's get out of Milwaukee,<br> we'll talk about it.<br> We came back from the hospital<br> and everybody was crying...<br> ... and we were in shock, but we still...<br> We had to milk.<br> The cows won't wait, will they?<br> No.<br> And when you went to the barn?<br> We found the note. My sister found it.<br> - From your mother?<br> - Yes.<br> Could you read it for us, please?<br> Just read the third paragraph,<br> just the highlighted section there.<br> "I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy<br> or any of the people..."<br> Anna.<br> - Anna.<br> - "Down at...<br> It's all right, Anna, go on.<br> - I'm just...<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Anna, they're...<br> - What's he doing?<br> Excuse me. She's a...<br> No, this is testimony. This is...<br> Excuse me, I have an objection.<br> You can be a witness here.<br> You can be a witness.<br> I am not a witness to this, sir, l...<br> Anna, I love you.<br> And I'm sitting here<br> and I'm listening to you and I swear...<br> ... that I love you more than anything<br> in the world. And this is my moment.<br> This strange conference-table moment.<br> Turn off that camera!<br> - This is my offering!<br> - No, I want this on the record!<br> How do I turn it off?<br> This is my offering. My clothes are<br> my offering. This is my shame.<br> My credentials! I'm ashamed!<br> And I love you, and I swear to God...<br> I guess that's it.<br> When do we get Don?<br> She said to try back in half an hour.<br> And how about the flights?<br> What's the story at o'Hare?<br> - Closed four minutes ago.<br> - Shit.<br> There is a foot of snow<br> in Detroit already.<br> Todd, could I get that coffee now?<br> Who is this guy they sent from New York?<br> Clayton? I never heard of him.<br> Michael Raymond clayton.<br> Born September 9, 1959,<br> St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.<br> Father is NYPD patrolman<br> Raymond Xavier Clayton.<br> Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.<br> Graduates Washingtonville Central<br> High School, Orange County, New York...<br> ... in 1977.<br> Graduates St. John's University, 1980.<br> Fordham Law, '82.<br> '82 through '86, he's ADA with<br> the Queens district attorney's office.<br> 1986, he's with<br> the Joint Manhattan-Queens...<br> ... Organized Crime Task Force.<br> And then in 1990, he starts<br> at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.<br> So he's a partner?<br> No. He's listed as special counsel.<br> Says he specializes in wills and trusts.<br> He goes from criminal prosecution<br> to wills and trusts?<br> He's been there 17 years,<br> he's not a partner?<br> This is the guy they send?<br> Who is this guy?<br> - Hi.<br> - Close the door.<br> All right. So nobody, none of you,<br> had any idea he was coming?<br> To Milwaukee? For a deposition?<br> We thought there was a settlement.<br> There's been some rumors.<br> Okay. Look, it's very simple.<br> Arthur has a chemical imbalance.<br> He's supposed to be taking his medication.<br> He's fallen behind on that.<br> He's on the mend.<br> He'll be fine in three or four days.<br> Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.<br> What happened here stays in this room.<br> This is not a piece of information<br> you wanna be out in front of.<br> Anybody has a problem with that,<br> I need to know right now.<br> All right.<br> We're stuck here overnight.<br> I'm gonna take him<br> home tomorrow if I can.<br> Who's in charge of<br> the deposition schedule?<br> - I am.<br> - Where do we stand with that?<br> I guess it's on hold.<br> We didn't know what to do.<br> Nothing is on hold.<br> Keep doing what you were.<br> Other side wants to talk,<br> they can call New York.<br> - I need his briefcase.<br> - Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.<br> - He said it was in the room.<br> - It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.<br> Find it.<br> So all these people, they all start<br> having these dreams, okay?<br> You know what a vision quest is?<br> You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?<br> Yeah. I think so. Like a...<br> Like a special dream.<br> Except this is like a whole bunch of people<br> having the same dream.<br> They're all having this dream<br> that they should go to this one place.<br> They don't know why or anything.<br> They just have this feeling<br> that they have to go there.<br> That they've been summoned.<br> That's the chapter.<br> Seriously, that's what it's called:<br> "Summons to conquest."<br> That's the title.<br> Yeah, but do they know? Do they know<br> they're all having the same dream?<br> No. That's what's so cool.<br> They all think it's just them.<br> That maybe they're, like, going crazy<br> or something, so they don't wanna admit it.<br> Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?<br> No. It's real. It's really happening.<br> Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?<br> Something larger than themselves<br> and they're not ready, are they...<br> ...to hear it?<br> Yeah. But later they will.<br> So if you're gonna read it,<br> I don't wanna spoil it.<br> What are you doing?<br> Who you talking to?<br> I called my dad. It's a friend of his.<br> - Who?<br> - Mr. Edens. You don't know him.<br> - Hello? Hello?<br> - Henry, it's after 11.<br> I gotta get off now.<br> No. Wait, wait. The book.<br> I need the book. The title.<br> The book is Realm and Conquest.<br> Realm and conquest.<br> - It's Book one, with the red cover.<br> - Henry, give me the phone.<br> I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?<br> Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...<br> Thank you, Henry, thank you.<br> Realm and Conquest. Thank you.<br> Karen? Hi, I'm Michael clayton.<br> - You're late.<br> - I know.<br> I'm sorry, it was more complicated<br> than we thought.<br> Where is he?<br> We've been here since 5:30.<br> - He's asleep.<br> - Well, wake him up.<br> That's not gonna happen.<br> We just got him sedated.<br> Once he gets back<br> on his regular medication...<br> ...then it's just a matter of time.<br> - Have you seen the video? The tape?<br> - I heard about it.<br> What happened after is worse.<br> This is in the parking lot, okay?<br> People running for their cars.<br> He's there in his socks, nothing else.<br> "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<br> I will not sit with this sickness any longer.<br> I cannot aid this sickness any longer."<br> What does this mean?<br> I'm not sure.<br> You've been with him the whole evening.<br> What's he saying?<br> He wasn't really making much sense.<br> This is totally unacceptable.<br> This is a 3-billion-dollar<br> class-action lawsuit.<br> In the morning, I have to call my board.<br> I have to tell them that the architect<br> of our entire defense has been arrested...<br> ...for running naked in a snowstorm,<br> chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.<br> I understand.<br> What sickness is he talking about?<br> - I don't know. It could be anything.<br> - Well, give me one.<br> Frostbite.<br> You think this is funny?<br> Look, his wife was sick<br> and she died last year.<br> His daughter doesn't talk to him.<br> He's all alone. All he does is your case.<br> He skipped his pills.<br> He had a bad day. That's it.<br> And you're somehow<br> the authority on this?<br> His last episode was eight years ago.<br> I was there.<br> I helped bring him home.<br> I watched him get better. That's it.<br> Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy<br> because of his low-key regularity...<br> ...you hired him because he's a killer,<br> because he's brilliant...<br> ...because he's crazy enough<br> to grind away on this case...<br> ...for six years without a break.<br> - We pay for his time.<br> I thought you wanted an explanation.<br> In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.<br> But, then, you know that.<br> Thank you, Michael.<br> He was mostly just quiet.<br> I heard him moving around,<br> I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.<br> - He took it?<br> - A deal's a deal, right?<br> A super job, Elston.<br> You get to New York, you need tickets<br> to the game or anything, you let me know.<br> I'll do that for sure.<br> Did you see her?<br> - Who?<br> - Anna.<br> No.<br> No, I didn't see her.<br> She probably went back to the farm.<br> Well, we need her.<br> Marty, even then, and the rest of them,<br> they won't understand.<br> Well, if anybody can explain it to them,<br> it's you, Arthur.<br> No, they're lost.<br> - They have what they want.<br> - Let it go, man.<br> This what you wanted?<br> To be a janitor?<br> Live like this? All this?<br> Do what you do?<br> It can't be.<br> It's...<br> It's a burden,<br> that's what I'm trying to tell you.<br> That's... That's how it feels.<br> Well, I know that<br> we've been summoned.<br> Get some sleep.<br> Hello?<br> Yes. Hi, I'm looking for verne?<br> You have a number?<br> Don Jeffries gave me the number.<br> He said I could call at any time.<br> No. The account number.<br> The code? I do.<br> I have it right here. One moment.<br> Excuse me one moment.<br> It's right here. 12-BKR-6.<br> Am I speaking with verne?<br> It's Mr. Verne.<br> Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.<br> Don said that I could...<br> I'm not exactly sure how this works.<br> Do you have e-mail<br> at your current location?<br> I do.<br> - Are you alone?<br> - I am.<br> Okay, I'm gonna upload you<br> a little encryption package we like to use.<br> It's pretty self-explanatory.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> But you have to give me a minute<br> to get to my desk. Hold on.<br> Okay. Thank you.<br> What I was wondering is...<br> ...I have an option on the lease<br> for six more years.<br> I was wondering if there's any way<br> I could lay that off.<br> Is the lease worth anything?<br> Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...<br> The fixtures are gone, but there's...<br> But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,<br> it's a great space.<br> But there's a...<br> Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.<br> Okay, yeah, I will.<br> All right. Thanks.<br> Come on, Arthur.<br> Arthur!<br> Arthur, open the door.<br> Arthur, open the door!<br> Arthur, open the goddamn door!<br> Arthur, op...!<br> Open the fucking door!<br> Arthur!<br> Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!<br> Arthur?!<br> - Mr. Verne, hey.<br> - Hey, Danny.<br> You guys are early.<br> I was pulling the other bags.<br> You can put them back.<br> There's been a change of plans, sorry.<br> - We ready?<br> - Yep.<br> For chrissake.<br> Don Jeffries signed this?<br> That's really his signature?<br> Where's the original?<br> We had a warehouse fire five years ago.<br> We lost a number of documents.<br> What the hell is this doing<br> in Arthur's bag?<br> Well, I don't know, Marty.<br> That's something I was hoping<br> you might be able to tell me.<br> What are we looking for?<br> If it says U/North, pull it aside.<br> Anything that says U/North.<br> What a mess this is.<br> I want all this...<br> ...everything here, I want it all packed up<br> and sent up to the house.<br> Any luck, Michael?<br> He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,<br> got out at west Fourth Street...<br> ...tipped the driver 100 bucks<br> and walked away.<br> Did you try his apartment?<br> - He moved.<br> - I know.<br> It's a loft. No doorman.<br> I rang, nobody answered.<br> - I called, I got the machine.<br> - So he could be anywhere.<br> Arthur downtown is not a good idea.<br> Some goddamn loft.<br> - Where's his daughter?<br> - I don't know. Spain, India.<br> Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.<br> Barry's taking over on U/North.<br> We got a lot of groveling to do.<br> You didn't exactly charm Karen crowder.<br> I was punting.<br> You gotta saddle up here<br> and get things under control.<br> Saddle up?<br> He needs to be under a doctor's care.<br> He needs to be admitted.<br> - Where?<br> - Does that really matter?<br> Michael, U/North needs to know<br> he's under control.<br> He's in a facility. They've been shook up.<br> They need to be reassured.<br> - It's not gonna be that easy.<br> - Why the hell not?<br> Because the laws in New York are<br> pretty tough on involuntary commitment.<br> Did you see this fucking tape?<br> I'm not arguing with you, Barry.<br> I'm telling you how it is.<br> You know what, guys?<br> We got 600 lawyers in this place.<br> Why don't we find out which one knows<br> about psychiatric-commitment statutes?<br> I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.<br> I'm at the door. We're good to go.<br> Yeah, roger that.<br> Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?<br> Every five minutes, copy that.<br> Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.<br> If you wish to leave a message,<br> please do so after the tone.<br> Arthur, pick up the phone.<br> Arthur, pick up the phone<br> and talk to me.<br> No? Not gonna do it?<br> What happened yesterday morning,<br> forget it. It doesn't matter.<br> Someday you and I<br> are gonna laugh about it.<br> But you gotta call me back.<br> You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> Because you said it yourself.<br> Part of this is definitely madness.<br> And there's a chemical part.<br> We both know it.<br> But if you're willing to start with that...<br> ... then I'm more than willing to<br> meet you halfway and say, yes...<br> ...this situation sucks.<br> This case sucks. U/North sucks.<br> We can start with that.<br> All right, Arthur? You hear me?<br> You're right about what we are.<br> I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying<br> that your behavior is out of control.<br> But I'm telling you you're right.<br> You called it. We're janitors, I get it.<br> But we came to this, Arthur.<br> We made decisions.<br> It didn't happen overnight.<br> You can't just suddenly stop and say,<br> "That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."<br> Arthur. Come on.<br> Goddamn it,<br> pick up the phone and talk to me.<br> Because whatever else<br> you think is so important...<br> ...you better let me help you,<br> because I'm telling you...<br> ...janitor to janitor, I don't see<br> anybody else with a broom on the horizon.<br> It's me, buddy. I'm the...<br> Mailbox is full.<br> Your message cannot be recorded.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello. Is Anna there?<br> Hang on.<br> Anna!<br> Where is she? Anna!<br> - Anna!<br> - Anna!<br> Anna, you've got a phone call!<br> Where is she? Anna!<br> Hello?<br> Anna, hi. It's Arthur.<br> - Hey.<br> - Did you get some sleep?<br> I guess.<br> Did you think about what we said?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You didn't tell anybody, did you?<br> No. My sister's spying on me,<br> but that's normal.<br> Yeah. Because I meant what I said.<br> I know. I know. It's just...<br> ...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.<br> Why are you choosing me?<br> I don't know. I'm crazy, right?<br> That's for sure.<br> I mean, does it...?<br> Does it really matter?<br> I mean, isn't it what we wait for?<br> To meet someone? And they're...<br> They're like a lens...<br> ...and suddenly you're looking<br> through them and everything changes...<br> ...and nothing can ever be<br> the same again.<br> Who you talking to?<br> It's for me, okay? I get calls too.<br> That guy?<br> Same guy. Same guy.<br> Sorry.<br> No. That's... That's okay.<br> My mother used to listen to my calls.<br> She can't believe I can do anything<br> on my own.<br> Well, that'll change.<br> I guess.<br> Yeah, but, see,<br> that's something we can show her.<br> That you can do something.<br> That we could... We could do that together<br> if you want. I mean...<br> I mean that I can help you do that.<br> I can get you 12 by Monday.<br> Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.<br> How do you figure that?<br> They look at 75 and they look at you<br> and they wonder what the problem is.<br> You say 12.<br> That's gonna make people nervous.<br> This was the day before yesterday.<br> Let me get my ducks in order.<br> What's the car worth?<br> It's a lease. It's the firm's.<br> So? You go to the bank.<br> You've got the apartment. You refinance.<br> I can't. I did that three months ago.<br> Are you back at the tables?<br> Like I need that kind of action.<br> I don't have enough going on.<br> I hope you're kidding.<br> If he finds out you're playing cards with<br> his money, there's no dialogue after that.<br> Do everyone a favor.<br> Get out the treasure map<br> and start digging.<br> You got a week.<br> - Hey, Michael. How are you?<br> - Hi, cindy. I'm good.<br> Come in. He's been on the phone<br> all morning. What else is new?<br> I am trying to get him out<br> in 15 minutes.<br> - Is he upstairs?<br> - He's taken over the living room.<br> What are you guys doing?<br> Get down here.<br> Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on<br> these kids, make sure they're downstairs.<br> Marty?<br> You know what he's doing?<br> He's making their case.<br> I'm going through his files here,<br> I'm reading this...<br> ...he's building a case against U/North.<br> - Nobody's gonna let him do that.<br> - Let him?<br> Who the hell's gonna stop him?<br> You know what I just heard?<br> He's calling these plaintiffs.<br> This woman from the deposition,<br> he's calling these people now.<br> He's got these discovery documents.<br> This is a fucking nightmare.<br> I tried him. Can't even leave a message.<br> He's got the machine jammed up.<br> - Is that his briefcase?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Why?<br> - We've been looking for it.<br> I don't know. It came up here<br> with all the other stuff from his office.<br> You can't believe<br> the crap he's got in here.<br> Listen, Marty...<br> ...I'm in a bind here.<br> I need a loan. I need 80 grand.<br> - I thought you were done with that.<br> - It's not that.<br> It's not the cards. It's none of that.<br> It's the restaurant.<br> Eighty thousand.<br> I'm sorry to jump you like this.<br> I've been trying to get a meeting<br> with you for two weeks.<br> And I know about the merger,<br> whether I'm supposed to or not.<br> There's nothing final on the merger.<br> Well, that's why I'm asking you now.<br> You're my meal ticket.<br> Once you're out,<br> it's me and Barry with strangers...<br> ...and I'm trying to explain what I do.<br> Everybody knows how valuable you are.<br> Everybody who needs to know.<br> I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.<br> I've been riding shotgun for 12 years<br> and I got no equity.<br> I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.<br> Nobody told you to<br> go into the bar business.<br> I only opened it so I'd have<br> something else, a way out.<br> I had no idea you were so unhappy.<br> How many times did I ask you<br> to put me back on a litigation team?<br> - How many?<br> - Anybody can go to court.<br> You think that's special?<br> - I was good at it.<br> - Wonderful. So are a lot of people.<br> At this, what you do, you're great.<br> For chrissakes, you got something<br> everybody wants. You have a niche.<br> You made a place.<br> You made a niche for yourself.<br> And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen<br> me when I was a DA back in Queens."<br> - Let me give you a serious piece of advice:<br> Leave it there.<br> God forbid you're not as good as<br> you remember. I've seen that happen too.<br> But I didn't come here for advice, did I?<br> So this is what? I give you the loan<br> or you don't help out with Arthur?<br> - I never said that.<br> - No?<br> Maybe you should have.<br> I don't know how you're gonna take care<br> of this, but this, this is cancer.<br> This is something, we don't get it<br> reined in and cleaned up soon...<br> ...everything's vulnerable. Everything.<br> - What are you telling me?<br> - That I'm counting on you.<br> I'm telling you that by this time next week,<br> Arthur will be under control...<br> ...and everybody who needs to will have<br> been reminded of your infinite value.<br> Jesus, Marty.<br> Hey.<br> When did you get so fucking delicate?<br> I'm late.<br> Why don't you just call Uncle Gene<br> and get the cops to help you?<br> It's not that kind of a problem.<br> - How much longer are we doing this?<br> - I don't know.<br> If he comes back to get his car,<br> you call that number and let me know.<br> - Thank you very much. I appreciate it.<br> - Okay. You're welcome.<br> If we're not gonna get to the movie,<br> why don't you just say so?<br> - What?<br> - I wanna go home.<br> Come on, Henry.<br> Hold up!<br> Stay in the car. Lock the door.<br> Arthur! Arthur!<br> Wait up.<br> Michael. Jeez. You scared me.<br> - Making a delivery?<br> - No, no, no.<br> Very funny. No, nothing like that.<br> Here, take one, please. Really.<br> It's... It's still warm.<br> It's the best bread I ever tasted.<br> So welcome home.<br> I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.<br> I was beginning to feel<br> a little overwhelmed.<br> - But you're feeling better now?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Much better, definitely.<br> - Not enough to call me back.<br> Well, I was trying<br> to gather my thoughts...<br> ...before I called you,<br> and that's what I was doing.<br> And how's that going?<br> Yes, it's good, very good. I just...<br> well, I just need to make my thoughts<br> a little bit more precise. That's...<br> That's my goal.<br> As good as this feels,<br> you know where it goes.<br> No. No. You're wrong.<br> What makes this feel good<br> is that I don't know where it goes.<br> How do I talk to you, Arthur?<br> So you hear me?<br> Like a child? Like a nut?<br> Like everything's fine?<br> What's the secret?<br> Because I need you to hear me.<br> - Well, I hear everything.<br> - Then hear this.<br> You need help.<br> Before this goes too far, you need help.<br> You got great cards here.<br> If you keep your clothes on, you can<br> do any goddamn thing you want.<br> You want out, you're out.<br> You wanna bake bread, go with God.<br> There's only one wrong answer<br> in this whole goddamn pile...<br> ...and you've got<br> your arms around it.<br> - Well, I said I was sorry.<br> - You thought the hotel was overwhelming?<br> You piss on this case,<br> they'll cut you off at the knees.<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> - I'm covering for you.<br> I'm telling them everything's fine.<br> You're fine. Everybody's cool.<br> I'm out running this "price of genius" story<br> to anybody who'll listen.<br> And then I wake up this morning and I hear<br> you're calling this girl from wisconsin...<br> ...messing with documents<br> and whatever else.<br> - How can you know that?<br> - They're gonna take everything.<br> Your partnership, your equity.<br> They're gonna pull your license.<br> - How do you know I called Anna?<br> - Marty told me.<br> - Well, how does he know?<br> - I don't know. I don't give a shit!<br> - You're tapping my phone.<br> - Jesus, Arthur.<br> Then explain it.<br> Tell me how Marty knows!<br> Because you're chasing a girl through<br> a parking lot with your dick hanging out.<br> You think she didn't get off the phone<br> and dial her attorney?<br> No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.<br> Really? You think your judgment<br> is state-of-the-art right now?<br> They're putting everything on the table.<br> You need to stop and think this through.<br> I'll help you think this through.<br> I'll find somebody to help you<br> think it through.<br> Don't do this.<br> You're making it easy for them.<br> Michael, I have great affection for you.<br> You lead a very rich and interesting life,<br> but you're a bagman, not an attorney.<br> If you wanted to have me committed...<br> ...you should have kept me in wisconsin,<br> where the arrest report, the videotape...<br> ...and eyewitness accounts<br> of my inappropriate behavior...<br> ...would have had<br> jurisdictional relevance.<br> I have no criminal record<br> in the state of New York.<br> And the single determining criterion<br> for involuntary incarceration is danger.<br> Is the defendant a danger<br> to himself or others?<br> You think you got the horses for that?<br> Well, good luck and God bless.<br> But I tell you this:<br> The last place you want to see me<br> is in court.<br> I'm not the enemy.<br> Then who are you?<br> We find the seed.<br> We shape the soil.<br> We speed the harvest.<br> We feed the planet.<br> We find the seed.<br> We shape the soil.<br> We speed the harvest.<br> We feed the planet.<br> What the hell is he doing?<br> We find the seed.<br> You've reached the voicemail of<br> Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.<br> Please leave your message<br> after the tone.<br> Yes!<br> Here we are, all together.<br> Is everyone listening?<br> This is the moment you've been waiting for.<br> A very special piece of paper.<br> So let's have a big, paranoid,<br> malignant round of applause...<br> ... for United Northfield Culcitate<br> Internal Research Memorandum 229.<br> June 19th, 1991.<br> "Conclusion:<br> The unanticipated market growth<br> for culcitate...<br> ...by small farms in colder climates<br> demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."<br> Would you guys like<br> a little bit of legal advice?<br> Never let a scientist<br> use the words "unanticipated"...<br> ...and "immediate"<br> in the same sentence.<br> Okay? Okay.<br> "In-house field studies<br> have indicated...<br> ... that small short-season farms dependent<br> on well water for human consumption...<br> ... are at risk for toxic<br> particulate concentrations at levels...<br> ...significant enough to cause<br> serious human tissue damage."<br> Well, this is a long way of saying that...<br> ...you don't even have to leave your house<br> to be killed by our product.<br> We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.<br> - "Culcitate's great market advantage...<br> - Give me the phone.<br> ... that it is tasteless, colorless<br> and does not precipitate...<br> ... has the potential<br> to mask and intensify...<br> ...these potentially lethal exposures."<br> Now, I love this.<br> Not only is this a great product...<br> ...it is a superb cancer delivery system.<br> "Chemical modifications<br> of the culcitate product...<br> ... the addition of a detector molecule,<br> such as an odorant or colorant...<br> ... would require a top-down redesign<br> of the Culcitate manufacturing process.<br> These costs,<br> while assumed to be significant...<br> ... were not summarized here. "<br> Which, loosely translated, means:<br> "It's going to cost a fortune to go back<br> on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...<br> ...so could someone else<br> please make the decision?"<br> "Clearly, the release of<br> these internal research documents...<br> ... would compromise<br> the effective marketing of Culcitate...<br> ...and must be kept within<br> the protective confines...<br> ...of United-Northfield's<br> trade secret language."<br> You don't need me<br> to tell you what that means.<br> Goodbye.<br> - It seemed to warrant my coming to...<br> - Yes.<br> You have to contain this.<br> - Contain?<br> - Right.<br> Well, that's my question.<br> What are the?<br> What's the option that we're looking at?<br> Along those lines.<br> You're talking about the paper, the data?<br> I don't...<br> well, I'm wondering<br> if there is some other option.<br> I mean something I'm not thinking of?<br> We deal in absolutes.<br> Okay. I understand that. I do.<br> The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.<br> We try, we do what we can.<br> Well, the other way?<br> Is the other way.<br> - Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.<br> - No.<br> This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.<br> This is nothing to do with Don.<br> Do you think it's doable?<br> Yeah. We have some good ideas.<br> You say move, we move.<br> If the ideas don't look so good,<br> we back off, reassess...<br> okay.<br> Is that, "okay, you understand,"<br> or "okay, proceed"?<br> Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?<br> Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?<br> - Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?<br> - Come on.<br> Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!<br> Come on.<br> Go on, Dad, make a wish.<br> If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.<br> You're a maniac. Unbelievable.<br> Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?<br> All right, Eddie.<br> Now, I did not make this myself<br> and I don't wanna hear any complaints.<br> Happy birthday.<br> You have time for cake?<br> Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.<br> You going in?<br> - I'm late already.<br> - Shit.<br> You're not both running out?<br> I got a situation.<br> - You can't hang?<br> - You're going in.<br> - Yeah. I got a shift.<br> - So do I.<br> Come on, man.<br> You haven't been up here in months.<br> If you go back now, Mickey,<br> Henry's staying here.<br> Good. You can drive him home.<br> Just stay for an hour.<br> The girls did all this stuff.<br> He'll be asleep by then.<br> Timmy's been calling me.<br> He's afraid to talk to you.<br> He should be.<br> - It closed out bad, right?<br> - Is that what he told you?<br> The kids are freaking out.<br> The in-laws are freaking out.<br> Pammy can't stop crying long enough<br> to start freaking out.<br> - She took him back.<br> - So what? Fuck her and the kids?<br> No. Fuck Timmy.<br> And nothing's closed, okay?<br> I sold everything and we're still short.<br> So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.<br> I got my hands full.<br> If it was you, he'd be in traction.<br> Yeah, he's sick, all right?<br> - He's sick. It's a sickness.<br> - There's a fresh perspective.<br> I've seen a lot of people falling off<br> the wagon lately. It's going around.<br> Is that pointed at me?<br> When do I see you?<br> How do I know what you're up to?<br> I haven't bet on a game in over a year.<br> I haven't been in a card room<br> in 10 months.<br> I gambled on the bar.<br> I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.<br> That was my big play, all right?<br> I put up my walk-away money<br> and it's gone and I'm scrambling.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Cool down. I hear you.<br> I'd be pissed off too.<br> Just hang for an hour.<br> - Okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Ready? And, lift.<br> Ready and go.<br> Wipe.<br> You better hit it.<br> We're good.<br> Okay, I found it. That's his number.<br> Dr. Mullien.<br> See if you have any more luck.<br> If I can. As soon as I get a chance.<br> It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.<br> I can pull the file...<br> Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.<br> I've got a date with a maniac attorney.<br> - Take a night off, Mickey.<br> - You look tired.<br> - I'm okay. See you soon.<br> - Be good.<br> - All right. Bye.<br> - Bye, Hen.<br> - Bye, Pop.<br> - Bye.<br> - Uncle Timmy, hey!<br> - How you doing, Henry?<br> Henry, get in the car.<br> Good to see you, Hen.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I've been sober eight days now.<br> Been back at the meetings.<br> I wanted you to know.<br> In front of the kid?<br> Mickey, please.<br> I know how bad I did, I swear.<br> I don't know how to make it right again.<br> It's all I think about.<br> What do I do? I don't know what to do.<br> Get Stephanie her tires back.<br> - Is he crying?<br> - I don't know.<br> Because of drugs, right?<br> That and everything else.<br> What?<br> Your Uncle Timmy...<br> ...and I mean this, on his best day,<br> is never as tough as you.<br> I'm not talking about crying<br> or the drugs or anything.<br> I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.<br> You understand me?<br> And all his charming bullshit,<br> this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...<br> ...and I know you love him,<br> and I know why.<br> But when you see him like that...<br> ...you don't have to worry.<br> That's not how it'll be for you.<br> You're not gonna be someone<br> that goes through life...<br> ...wondering why shit keeps<br> falling out of the sky around them.<br> I know that. I know it.<br> Okay?<br> I see it every time I look at you.<br> I see it right now.<br> I don't know where you got it from,<br> but you got it.<br> Okay?<br> Hello?<br> The neighbors came by.<br> They're renovating the loft downstairs.<br> They had water flooding from<br> his bathroom down to their place.<br> His front door, fire escape,<br> he had everything locked up pretty good.<br> It took our guys 10 minutes.<br> They had to knock the thing down.<br> There's pills all over the place.<br> Just the scene alone is<br> pretty definitive for suicide.<br> Then I spoke to some of your partners...<br> ...who ran down these problems<br> he'd been having lately, so...<br> - Is there a note?<br> - No. They looked.<br> It could be an accident or he was gonna<br> write a note and just messed up.<br> Can I get in there?<br> His place? Not now. It's sealed.<br> Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.<br> We're gonna try and reach his daughter.<br> I guess she's off in Europe.<br> But she's gotta come in.<br> Or the M.E.'s gotta come back<br> with a toxicology report.<br> That's a couple of weeks at least<br> that it's gotta stay like that.<br> Sorry.<br> Sure.<br> Okay.<br> I know your brother a little.<br> My wife works the 190 out in Queens.<br> I'll tell him hello.<br> If something comes in,<br> I'll get back to you.<br> Yeah. I appreciate it.<br> I'm sorry for your loss.<br> - Michael.<br> - Jeff.<br> This is tough.<br> Yeah, it is. He in here?<br> Dumb son of a bitch.<br> What a thing.<br> - Hold on.<br> - I don't even know...<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - Yeah. All right.<br> I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.<br> That crazy goddamn bastard.<br> What a waste.<br> What the hell was he thinking?<br> Marty? I gotta set this up.<br> Go. Go.<br> You okay?<br> Yeah, I'm fine.<br> Come on, let's get you a drink.<br> I just keep replaying all this back.<br> Like, did I push him too hard?<br> Not a chance.<br> I just couldn't get through to him.<br> What, you scared him to death?<br> Come on. The man was a bull.<br> - Never happened.<br> - Why does he fold, then? Why does he?<br> It's gotta be an accident.<br> No, no. Arthur without a note?<br> He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.<br> Has to be an accident.<br> I don't get that.<br> I don't understand that either.<br> One minute he's gonna<br> take on the whole world...<br> ...and then 12 hours later,<br> he's sucking down pills. Why?<br> Why?<br> Because people are<br> fucking incomprehensible. "why?"<br> Thirty years I know Arthur.<br> Good years.<br> And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?<br> I can't even say, it's so awful.<br> You can say it.<br> We caught a lucky break.<br> We did, didn't we?<br> Marty? We need to get up to the office.<br> - They accepted?<br> - In principle.<br> Don Jeffries wants us<br> on the phone in half an hour.<br> I tried to explain about Arthur,<br> but they're short on sympathy.<br> Wait a minute. U/North is settling?<br> They see a window. They wanna try.<br> It's their show. What are we gonna do?<br> You did what you could, Michael.<br> We all did.<br> It's...<br> It's what we got.<br> - You need a ride?<br> - No, thanks, I'm fine.<br> Hello.<br> Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.<br> Who is this?<br> Michael clayton. I'm an attorney in<br> New York. I got your number from Arthur.<br> - You have got some nerve.<br> - Excuse me?<br> You get her all the way to New York city<br> and then leave her at the airport?<br> This is not a complicated person.<br> This is a girl who's never been<br> farther than Milwaukee.<br> - Wait a minute. Now, wait.<br> - No, you wait.<br> She's coming home tomorrow<br> and when she does, if you call here again...<br> Are you telling me she's<br> in New York right now?<br> This is a young girl, do you hear me?<br> She's in the city right now?<br> What kind of people are you?<br> Listen. You just stay on the phone<br> one second. One second.<br> Anna.<br> Anna?<br> My name's Michael clayton.<br> I'm a friend of Arthur's.<br> I spoke with your sister.<br> She told me you were here.<br> Please open the door, Anna.<br> What are you thinking?<br> I don't know. I'll watch the door.<br> You check his car. Let's get some details.<br> He didn't want to say<br> exactly what it was.<br> Just that when I got here,<br> he would pick me up...<br> ...and show me, and I would see...<br> ...that it was something<br> that would win the whole case.<br> Even this morning...<br> ...I mean, I thought:<br> "Okay, if I get to the airport<br> and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.<br> Okay, you're stupid,<br> and you can go home now."<br> But it was there and he paid,<br> like, 800 dollars...<br> ...for a first-class ticket.<br> And I just...<br> I got on the plane.<br> I believed him.<br> You think maybe he was<br> in some way disappointed?<br> Let's say that he knew that you<br> told somebody else about all of this...<br> ...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,<br> he was disappointed by that?<br> - But I didn't.<br> - You must have told somebody else.<br> No.<br> He made me promise.<br> You didn't tell anybody else about this?<br> Not one other person?<br> No.<br> He really was crazy, wasn't he?<br> - You talking about this?<br> - Let me see.<br> - You know what that is?<br> - Yeah.<br> You said a favor.<br> That's more than a favor.<br> Well, nobody's gonna know<br> where it came from.<br> - Are you that jammed up?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Who asked for this?<br> It's the restaurant, right?<br> One of these guys you owe?<br> "Get me a seal."<br> You really wanna know?<br> This just gets better and better.<br> What are we doing?<br> Freeze!<br> Right there, asshole! Don't move!<br> - It's all right, I'm a friend!<br> - Get your hands up!<br> Get your hands up now! Now!<br> - What's in your hand?<br> - It's a book.<br> Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!<br> - Turn around. Slowly.<br> - All right. All right. Okay.<br> - Who else is here?<br> - Nobody.<br> - I said, who else is here?<br> - Nobody's here!<br> Check in there.<br> You move, I'll take your head off.<br> Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...<br> who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.<br> - Now I owe them both my balls.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - You know I am.<br> - "Nobody will know it's me."<br> You know what happens they don't<br> bury this, that I gave you this?<br> It's bad. I know it.<br> I'm 18 months away from my 20.<br> You just put my pension in jeopardy.<br> - You made your point.<br> - It's not a point!<br> - Who called 911?<br> - What?<br> The building was empty. I was quiet.<br> I wasn't there very long.<br> Who called it in?<br> Does that make sense to you...?<br> This never happened.<br> You got these cops thinking<br> you're a lawyer.<br> You got these lawyers thinking<br> you're a cop.<br> You got everybody fooled, don't you?<br> Everybody but you.<br> You know exactly what you are.<br> We tried calling you six times.<br> But your machine must be<br> busted or something.<br> We gave it our best shot.<br> We ran out of red covers.<br> We only had 2000 in stock...<br> ...so we did the other thousand in blue.<br> Is everything all right?<br> It's fine, yeah.<br> You have a van or something?<br> Because I have 25 boxes back there...<br> Do me a favor. Hang on to them.<br> I'll come back and pick everything up<br> next week.<br> - Seriously? Thanks, man.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hello.<br> Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.<br> What?<br> Do you know Michael Clayton?<br> Yeah, why?<br> We have a situation.<br> Hey, did they find you?<br> - Who?<br> - Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.<br> Marty.<br> Your phone's off. There's too much<br> going on for your phone to be off.<br> - I need a minute.<br> - Yeah, well, we're late...<br> we never got to finish last night.<br> Did you close the place?<br> You look like hell.<br> - No, I left right after you left.<br> - Lf you say so.<br> We've been here all night.<br> We had to make an announcement.<br> Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.<br> I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.<br> I had to pull the trigger.<br> I put Bob Nast and Kim,<br> probably a mistake.<br> They're gonna pull together a memorial<br> service by the end of the week.<br> I told them to call you<br> if they need any help.<br> No, no, no.<br> The other one. The other one.<br> So we cut you a check this morning.<br> There's some strings attached.<br> And Barry...<br> There's no way around this,<br> Barry's gonna have to be involved.<br> What if Arthur was on to something?<br> What do you mean? On to what?<br> U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?<br> What if he was right?<br> Right about what?<br> That we're on the wrong side?<br> Wrong side, wrong way,<br> everything, all of it.<br> This is news?<br> This case reeked from day one.<br> I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?<br> What would they do?<br> What would they do if he went public?<br> What would they do? Are you fucking soft?<br> They're doing it.<br> We don't straighten the settlement out<br> in 24 hours...<br> ...they're gonna withhold<br> $9 million in fees.<br> Then they'll pull out the video of<br> Arthur doing his flashdance.<br> They'll sue us for legal malpractice.<br> Except there won't be anything to win<br> because the London merger will be dead...<br> ...and we'll be selling off<br> the goddamn furniture.<br> That's 80.<br> We're calling it a bonus.<br> Three-year contract<br> at your current numbers.<br> That's assuming this all works out.<br> You're doing this now?<br> Look, I agreed to this, okay?<br> But there's rules now.<br> You want the contract,<br> you sign a confidentiality agreement.<br> It's gonna be bulletproof<br> and retroactive.<br> Because Marty's too nice to say it...<br> ...but with all you know about this place,<br> the clients and people who work here...<br> ...it makes it a little weird<br> when you ask for 80 grand.<br> If I was gonna shake anybody down,<br> I'd come to you...<br> ...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.<br> Is this him or you?<br> - Lf I'm wrong, I apologize.<br> - You're way the fuck wrong.<br> So there you go.<br> Enough. Okay? Everybody.<br> He's an asshole, but he knows it.<br> And you're on the record.<br> Okay? Everybody happy?<br> - Don Jeffries is here.<br> - We're on the way.<br> Call Bob Nast.<br> Just see if they need help with this thing.<br> You're welcome.<br> You said 12. This is 75.<br> Well, don't get too excited.<br> You want a drink?<br> No. I'm working.<br> So we're square, then. No bad blood.<br> You're just doing your job.<br> That's right.<br> Take it easy, Gabe.<br> Michael.<br> Check.<br> Check.<br> - Check.<br> - Half the pot. Two hundred.<br> Two hundred to go.<br> So, what happened with the bar?<br> You just had to be a rock star, huh?<br> What are you doing? You just got here.<br> Guy plays nine hands, walks away.<br> I scare you away? What did I do?<br> Did I scare you away?<br> Get out.<br> Get out of the car now.<br> - Walter?<br> - Michael.<br> - Michael. Thank God you're there.<br> - Yeah.<br> You have eight...<br> ... six, five...<br> ... four, three...<br> Get out of the car.<br> - Tell him to stay off the phone.<br> - All right. But you're on it?<br> Am I clean?<br> Just keep walking.<br> You copy. Am I clean?<br> Just keep moving.<br> He's walking to the car.<br> - To let him know you're on the way.<br> I'll get back to you with the details.<br> - Just give me two minutes.<br> - I'll be in the car.<br> I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.<br> It's loose. I got a pulse.<br> He's up there somewhere, but...<br> Let's find a way to boost the signal.<br> - I don't know what walter promised you...<br> - A miracle worker!<br> That's walter on the phone,<br> "I'm sending you a miracle worker."<br> - Well, he misspoke.<br> - About what?<br> About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?<br> Or that you're any good at it?<br> We're up. Just got a signal.<br> There's nothing back this way.<br> What's he doing?<br> Maybe he's lost.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - That's him.<br> He was alone, right?<br> - Yeah, I think so.<br> - Call it, yes or no?<br> We gotta turn around.<br> Talk to me.<br> It's strobing.<br> No, we're good. I think we're good.<br> Just keep going.<br> No, he turned. Somehow he turned.<br> - Where?<br> - He took...<br> - He took a left.<br> - I don't have a left.<br> - East. He's southeast.<br> - What, so we missed it?<br> - Or the grid is wrong.<br> - Hang on.<br> - We gotta go back to one.<br> - One is what? Where's our one?<br> Half a mile straight ahead.<br> Just keep driving. Just go.<br> It says we're closing.<br> But that's west. It can't be west.<br> The signal or the grid?<br> - It's both. It just keeps dropping out.<br> - Goddamn it.<br> Give me the cell.<br> Our signal's good.<br> What?<br> Thanks, Mickey.<br> Just get me out of here.<br> I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,<br> soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.<br> I think we should have someone from<br> the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...<br> - Yeah?<br> - Did you hear?<br> - Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.<br> - No. Michael clayton.<br> What?<br> Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.<br> He was killed.<br> What?<br> Holy shit.<br> It has been and it remains<br> the U/North position...<br> ... that this lawsuit is baseless<br> and without merit.<br> Our reluctance to negotiate<br> was anchored by this belief...<br> ...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand<br> for settlement...<br> ...in excess of 3 billion dollars.<br> The reason that we are<br> all here today is...<br> ...that several key elements<br> in the case have changed.<br> You all have<br> a tentative proposal packet...<br> ... which outlines the details,<br> but the bottom line is this:<br> Over the past several months<br> we had gotten word...<br> ...that the plaintiffs were<br> growing impatient...<br> ...and were in the process<br> of revising their settlement numbers.<br> We also learned...<br> ... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees<br> were capped at 32 percent...<br> ... up to 400 million dollars...<br> ...above which,<br> their fees dropped to 24 percent.<br> So we knew that there would be<br> this motivational dead zone for them...<br> ...in the middle there.<br> Finally...<br> ...our finance team informed us<br> that they had run the numbers...<br> ...and that the tax benefit...<br> ...provided that we bring<br> the settlement in under 600 million...<br> ...and within this fiscal year...<br> ...that the write-off on this settlement<br> would essentially pay for itself.<br> The package that you have before you<br> represents, in my judgment...<br> ... the strongest possible position for<br> our company under the circumstances.<br> And, as chief counsel...<br> ...it is my recommendation<br> that this proposal be confirmed.<br> Thank you, Karen. If you just give us<br> a few minutes to talk about it.<br> Certainly. I'll be right outside.<br> Well...<br> How'd it go in there?<br> Pretty freaky, huh?<br> Did you see Arthur?<br> He's wandering around here somewhere.<br> I'm kidding. Lighten up.<br> You got one of these? It's a great memo.<br> It's an oldie but a goodie.<br> Got your heart racing, don't I?<br> I don't know what it is<br> you think you're doing.<br> What do you think I'm doing?<br> The suit's over. We have a deal.<br> Whatever that is,<br> it's meaningless at this point.<br> You think? I must have gotten it wrong.<br> I thought you had a tentative proposal.<br> I didn't realize you'd signed<br> all those checks.<br> That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.<br> What am I gonna do with them?<br> I'm calling Marty.<br> Good. Good. Do it.<br> That's a great place to start.<br> Let's find out who told him<br> Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.<br> Let's find out who tapped those phones.<br> This memorandum, even if it's authentic,<br> which I doubt, I highly doubt...<br> - I know what you did to Arthur.<br> - It's protected. It belongs to U/North.<br> - I know you killed him.<br> - It's attorney-client privilege.<br> See, now, that's just not<br> the way to go here, Karen.<br> For such a smart person,<br> you really are lost, aren't you?<br> This conversation is over.<br> I'm not the guy that you kill.<br> I'm the guy that you buy.<br> Are you so fucking blind<br> you don't even see what I am?<br> I'm the easiest part of your whole<br> goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?<br> Don't you know who I am?<br> I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.<br> I do everything from shoplifting housewives<br> to bent congressmen...<br> ...and you're gonna kill me?<br> What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.<br> You want a carry permit? You want<br> a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?<br> I sold out Arthur for 80 grand<br> and a contract and you're gonna kill me?<br> What do you want?<br> What do I want?<br> I want more.<br> I want out.<br> And with this, I want everything.<br> Is there a number?<br> Ten is a number.<br> Ten? Ten what?<br> Ten million?<br> Where do you think I'm gonna get<br> You know what's great about this?<br> Did you read it to the end?<br> You see who signed it?<br> Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...<br> ...if he wants to pass the hat<br> for a worthy cause.<br> This would have to be<br> a longer conversation...<br> ...and would have to take place<br> somewhere else.<br> Where? My car?<br> All right.<br> I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.<br> Five and I'll forget about Arthur.<br> Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something<br> that we could talk about.<br> Good. And then the other 5 is<br> to forget about the 468 people...<br> ...that you knocked off<br> with your weed killer.<br> Let me finish up this meeting.<br> I'll talk to Don...<br> Do I look like I'm negotiating?!<br> Karen?<br> - One second.<br> - Everything okay?<br> Yes.<br> Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.<br> Offshore. Immediately.<br> - Yes.<br> - Say it!<br> Ten million dollars, your account,<br> the moment this meeting is through.<br> - Karen! Everyone's waiting.<br> - I'm coming, Don.<br> You have a deal.<br> You're so fucked.<br> What?<br> - You're fucked.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Take a wild guess.<br> - Is there a problem?<br> - I don't understand.<br> - Let me get a picture while I'm at it.<br> - You don't want the money?<br> - Keep the money. You'll need it.<br> Is this fellow bothering you?<br> Am I bothering you?<br> Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.<br> What the hell's going on? Who are you?<br> I'm Shiva, the god of death.<br> Ron! Ronny, I need security<br> out here immediately.<br> All right. Here we go.<br> That guy right there, stop him.<br> Grab that guy.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.<br> Come back with us<br> and we'll explain everything.<br> Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need<br> any medical attention.<br> You guys go into the ballroom.<br> Nobody leaves.<br> Have your guys cover every exit.<br> Will you please explain to me<br> what's going on here?<br> Did you get all that?<br> Yeah. Got it.<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah. Just gotta get some air.<br> Sure.<br> Just stay close, okay?<br> Okay.<br> So, what are we doing?<br> Give me 50 dollars' worth.<br> Just drive.<br>
