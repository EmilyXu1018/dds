Got bail.<br> Vanished.<br> - His name?<br> - Who?<br> - The lawyer.<br> - Lawyer?<br> Who got the Frenchman off.<br> Yesil is his name.<br> I don't know anything else<br> about him.<br> Yesil.<br> The best thing to do<br> is get your ass out of here.<br> - Yeah, but how?<br> - Catch the midnight express.<br> What's that?<br> It's not a train.<br> It's a prison word for... escape.<br> It doesn't stop around here.<br> Dad, I'm sorry.<br> Forget it.<br> I'll punch you in the nose later.<br> We've got to get you out of here.<br> This is a suit I brought for you.<br> Smarten you up a little.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> How's Mom?<br> Well, she's bad.<br> She couldn't make the trip.<br> You know Mom. Her boy...<br> Susan told us<br> before we got your letter.<br> She's saving to come back here...<br> Don't let her come.<br> How's Rob? How's Peg?<br> They're the same. You know.<br> We told the neighbours<br> you were in hospital in Europe.<br> This is Stanley Daniels.<br> He's the American Consul here.<br> Billy, we're going to do everything<br> in our power to get you out of here.<br> That's Necdit Yesil,<br> the lawyer you asked for.<br> I know exactly what you feel,<br> but you must not worry.<br> We'll get the right court<br> and the right judge.<br> I'll arrange everything, just right.<br> I understand that if you get bail,<br> it's easy to get across the border.<br> That's what we're shooting for.<br> I've spoken to the State Department.<br> Right now, relations with the Turks<br> aren't too good. Nixon upset them.<br> - Our best bet is right here.<br> - Dad, I'll pay you back for this.<br> Money doesn't matter, Billy.<br> Not at this stage.<br> - Where did you get that limp?<br> - I twisted my ankle.<br> - Where are you staying?<br> - The Hilton.<br> - How do you like Istanbul?<br> - Interesting place.<br> The food is lousy. The crap<br> they sell in the restaurants...<br> I had to run to the toilet.<br> You should have seen the toilet.<br> I'll eat at the Hilton every night.<br> Steak, French fries and ketchup.<br> Billy...<br> - Why did you do it?<br> - Money.<br> I know you kids smoke that stuff<br> and we drink booze, -<br> - but taking it across the border,<br> that's stupid.<br> I know.<br> Dad... get me out of here.<br> I promise you. Just sit tight.<br> Let me work with Mr. Daniels<br> and Mr. Yesil here.<br> We'll get you out, okay?<br> Hey, Billy... Okay?<br> Okay.<br> - What did that prosecutor say?<br> - It's not important.<br> We made our case. You spoke well.<br> The judge liked you.<br> Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.<br> - Four years, two months.<br> - Four years?<br> We'll appeal.<br> It'll be reduced for good behaviour.<br> It is only for possession.<br> The prosecutor wanted<br> a life sentence for smuggling.<br> To be honest, Mr. Hayes,<br> it is a great victory.<br> With good time,<br> it works out to about three years.<br> And then there's the appeal.<br> Daniels and Yesil<br> are all working for you.<br> We're trying to get you transferred.<br> Daniels thinks there might be<br> a political amnesty any month now.<br> All right, Billy...<br> I know it sounds tough,<br> but we are going to get you out.<br> I promise you.<br> Don't do anything stupid.<br> They could play with your sentence.<br> All right, now...<br> I'm putting $500 in the bank.<br> Anything you need, you write.<br> There's food here,<br> candy, writing paper, -<br> - books, cigarettes, soap,<br> toothbrush...<br> I've sold insurance for 30 years.<br> Now I've got to see my own son...<br> Jesus!<br> If I could be where you are...<br> I'd be there.<br> I love you, Dad.<br> You take good care of my boy,<br> or I'll have your fucking head!<br> Dear Susan,<br> You can drift in here<br> and never know you're gone.<br> You can fade so far out, you<br> don't know where you are anymore.<br> I find loneliness is a physical pain<br> that hurts all over.<br> To the Turks<br> everything is "soyle boyle".<br> It means "Iike this, like that."<br> You never know what will happen.<br> All foreigners are "ayip."<br> They're considered dirty.<br> So is homosexuality, but they<br> do it every chance they get.<br> There are about 1,000 things<br> that are "ayip".<br> You can stab or shoot somebody<br> below the waist but not above.<br> Stabbing somebody in the ass<br> is considered Turkish revenge.<br> I know it must sound crazy to you,<br> but this place is crazy.<br> One day,<br> one of the new kids was raped.<br> So they picked out<br> four of the worst kids.<br> Then there's Rifki. The more<br> I know of him, the more I hate him.<br> $10 for this shit? You pig.<br> There are no pigs in Turkey.<br> - This shit is shit.<br> - No, it's good. Good shit.<br> - You big shit.<br> - Yeah, me big shit.<br> You asshole.<br> What is it with you?<br> Just what the hell is it, man?<br> You don't fuck with me,<br> I don't fuck with you.<br> You fuck with me all the time.<br> You make crummy tea.<br> - You rip us off on the hash.<br> - I make special tea for you.<br> We have to live like brothers.<br> We have to be in here together.<br> For all the money you've got,<br> you've got nothing.<br> - You are American, you don't know.<br> - Know what?<br> Dog eat dog.<br> You fuck other man before he<br> fucks you. And you must fuck last.<br> Come on down.<br> Egbert...<br> Sodding cat.<br> William!<br> Are you all right?<br> The new American Ambassador<br> is following your case.<br> He says there is progress.<br> You want a cigarette?<br> But there is another route...<br> ... that is quite possible.<br> For a proper amount of money,<br> it is possible -<br> - to convince the ten officials<br> to lose track of your papers -<br> - before the High Court in Ankara<br> confirms your sentence.<br> And you could be in Greece by<br> the time they discover the mistake.<br> But I have to act before the<br> official sentence is handed down.<br> And for that<br> I must pay certain officials.<br> What's that?<br> The blueprints to the prison, man.<br> There was this German architect<br> in the hospital.<br> He let me copy them.<br> It's too bad<br> you didn't have a Xerox machine.<br> There are two ways out of here.<br> One is over the roof,<br> but that's kind of risky.<br> The other way, I'll need your help,<br> and that is under.<br> A tunnel?<br> - Are you serious?<br> - This is not Stalag 17.<br> That's where you're wrong.<br> The tunnel is already built.<br> There's a basement<br> where they used to keep weapons.<br> Beneath that are the catacombs the<br> Christians built to bury their dead.<br> We're sitting<br> right on top of it... here.<br> The kraut says that there's<br> a bunch of hollow shafts.<br> They're like dumbwaiters,<br> all along these walls.<br> One of them<br> is right next to our shower.<br> If we get in there,<br> we can get down into the catacombs.<br> With three of us working,<br> it shouldn't take too long.<br> I swear I heard a couple of dead<br> Christians singing down there.<br> - You stop shitting me, man. Okay?<br> - How do we get into the shaft?<br> We knock three times and<br> say we're a friend of the deceased.<br> I'm getting this together and<br> I don't need no gastro-head along.<br> You understand me?<br> - We go through the wall.<br> - We go through the wall?<br> Go through the wall.<br> There's no reinforced steel<br> in those shower walls.<br> It's real soft<br> from underground seepage.<br> You can almost push it over.<br> All we have to do...<br> We only have to use your screwdriver<br> to scrape the mortar out.<br> We pull out three stones<br> and squeeze through...<br> Squeeze through,<br> and get our ass down the shaft.<br> - It's a two-night operation.<br> - What do we do in the catacombs?<br> What do you want, a door?<br> There's miles of them down there.<br> - You must be fucking crazy.<br> - They've got to come up someplace.<br> You won't find any catacombs,<br> you'll just finish up in section 13.<br> Billy... the tunnel or the roof?<br> Forget the wall.<br> Rifki's always there.<br> - The roof is guarded.<br> - Help me get into the shaft.<br> If we get caught,<br> I'll get the shaft.<br> I'll be back up to<br> three years again, maybe more.<br> Fuck it, then.<br> You choose your own death.<br> I'll do this thing on my own.<br> I'm taking the roof out of here.<br> No! I can't take it!<br> Dear Susan,<br> Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.<br> He got a severe hernia<br> and lost a testicle.<br> He's been in the sanatorium<br> for months.<br> In comparison,<br> my problems seem small.<br> But 2 years have gone by.<br> The Turks<br> are slowly draining my life away.<br> - Why do you keep your hair short?<br> - To remind me that I hate it here.<br> Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.<br> Prison...<br> - Okay.<br> - I've thought of another way.<br> - Another way what?<br> - Out of here.<br> When I was in the sanatorium,<br> there was only one guard on duty.<br> - I could have got out of there.<br> - Why didn't you?<br> As soon as I could walk,<br> they threw me back in here.<br> - Lucky you.<br> - I tell you, Billy...<br> Another ward in the sanatorium<br> had no guard on it at all.<br> - Who was in it?<br> - Three guys.<br> - What was wrong with them?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I think they were dead.<br> - It figures.<br> I've got to go. It's Daniels!<br> Turkish justice has done it again.<br> They're going to let me off.<br> Jimmy, I'm going home!<br> God! "I've got to go."<br> What's wrong?<br> Sit down, Billy.<br> I'm afraid<br> I have some bad news for you.<br> - Is it Dad? Mom?<br> - No.<br> - You're going to have a new court.<br> - What do you mean?<br> The prosecutor objected<br> to your sentence for possession.<br> He wanted a smuggling conviction.<br> The Ankara court reviewed it.<br> It seems everyone wanted<br> an example made. A scapegoat.<br> We've been notified<br> that they rejected the sentence.<br> There were 35 judges in the court.<br> The lower court in Istanbul<br> had to go along with the decision.<br> The judge likes you.<br> He notified your dad.<br> What do you mean, life?<br> - Life for what?<br> - Billy!<br> I have 53 days left!<br> So now it's time for me to speak.<br> What is there for me to say?<br> When I finish,<br> you'll sentence me for my crime.<br> So let me ask you now:<br> What is a crime?<br> What is a punishment?<br> It seems to vary from time to time<br> and place to place.<br> What's legal today<br> is suddenly illegal tomorrow.<br> What's illegal is suddenly legal<br> because everybody's doing it.<br> You can't put everybody in jail.<br> I'm not saying<br> this is right or wrong.<br> I'm just saying<br> that's the way it is.<br> I've spent 3 years of my life<br> in your prison.<br> I think I've paid for my error.<br> If it's your decision today<br> to sentence me to more years...<br> My lawyer... that's a good one.<br> He says, "Be cool, Billy."<br> "Be good. I'll get you a pardon,<br> an amnesty, an appeal."<br> This has been going on now<br> for 3 years.<br> I've been playing it cool.<br> I've been good.<br> Now I'm damn tired of being good.<br> You said I had 53 days left.<br> You hung 53 days in my face,<br> and then you took them away.<br> And you!<br> I wish you could be standing<br> where I'm standing right now.<br> Then you would know something<br> that you don't know.<br> Mercy!<br> You would know that a just society<br> is based on the concept of mercy.<br> Its sense of fair play and justice.<br> But I guess that's like asking<br> a bear to shit in a toilet.<br> For a nation of pigs,<br> it sure is funny you don't eat them.<br> Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,<br> but I can't.<br> I hate.<br> I hate you.<br> I hate your nation<br> and I hate your people.<br> I fuck your sons and daughters<br> because they're pigs.<br> You're a pig.<br> You're all pigs.<br> My hands are tied by Ankara.<br> I must sentence you, William Hayes,<br> to be imprisoned -<br> - for a term no less than 30 years.<br> May it pass quickly.<br> Got the old Istanbul blues<br> Istanbul blues<br> they give me 30 years<br> ain't got nothing left to lose...<br> We are going to get you out.<br> I promise you.<br> Don't do anything stupid.<br> They could play with your sentence.<br> I was busted at the border...<br> The best thing to do<br> is get your ass out of here.<br> The best way you can.<br> Hey, I think I found it.<br> Come here.<br> Listen to that.<br> Do you hear anything?<br> I told you, you suckers.<br> You didn't believe me.<br> Keep it down.<br> Look how soft this is.<br> It'll be easy.<br> Go and get Rifki's poker,<br> but don't wake him up.<br> It's really soft. It's coming.<br> - Jimmy, it's coming.<br> - Here, use this.<br> It's coming real easy.<br> It's coming right out.<br> It's easier than I thought.<br> It's a piece of cake.<br> It's coming.<br> Like butter.<br> Hey, Max. Rifki.<br> - Keep checking for Rifki.<br> - It's okay.<br> - Watch it.<br> - I thought you wanted out of here.<br> - They're loose.<br> - Let's try.<br> - Watch your hernia.<br> - Fuck that.<br> - Okay? You got it?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's it. It's the shaft.<br> It's coming.<br> It's okay.<br> - Let's go, Billy.<br> - It's too late. We're not prepared.<br> We'll go tomorrow.<br> It's too late.<br> Let's put them back. Help me.<br> Any fuck-ups<br> and we should be back by dawn.<br> You got everything?<br> Maps, railroad, bus timetables.<br> Okay, let's do it.<br> - Can you see?<br> - No.<br> Come on, Max,<br> get your ass down here.<br> This way to Istanbul, baby.<br> Watch it.<br> Mind how you go there.<br> Are you all right?<br> Come down this pole and cross over.<br> Terrific.<br> - All right, it's a tunnel.<br> - Let's go.<br> Come on, Max.<br> Fuck! What is that? Shit!<br> Shit! It's a dead end.<br> The Turks must have blocked it up.<br> Shit!<br> Billy!<br> - What the fuck are we going to do?<br> - What time is it?<br> - Go back.<br> - You must be fucking joking.<br> We go back, seal it up,<br> and come back tomorrow.<br> Every night, until we get out.<br> There's got to be a way out.<br> Billy, they found it. Rifki.<br> No do, no do.<br> I'm going to kick your brains<br> all over your fucking kitchen.<br> Fine! Good. Man to man.<br> When we're finished, I'll bring<br> Hamidou and he'll kick your ass.<br> Let's go, Max. Come on.<br> - I know what I'm going to do.<br> - What?<br> - I'm going to cut his throat.<br> - Whose?<br> Rifki.<br> What have I got to lose?<br> Anyway, I'd really enjoy it.<br> Why don't you sit down?<br> You're in no shape to kill anybody.<br> - I want to cut his fucking throat.<br> - It's already been cut.<br> Then I'll cut his balls off.<br> You know, if you really<br> wanted to hurt Rifki...<br> His money. Steal that<br> and you steal his life's blood.<br> Could you see his face if everything<br> he had got snatched?<br> - If we only knew where he hid it.<br> - I know where it is.<br> Max...<br> The money?<br> Them that hides can find, says l.<br> I've seen him, the big tit.<br> He looks at it, late at night.<br> Talking to it.<br> Where?<br> Max, where?<br> The money, where?<br> In his radio.<br> In the back of his radio.<br> That's why he never plays it.<br> - He never had one.<br> - Soon he's back on the street.<br> No friends, no money,<br> plenty of enemies.<br> - I'll drink to that.<br> - Me, too.<br> - I've just got some news on Jimmy.<br> - Really? What?<br> They sent him to hospital.<br> They ruptured his hernia again.<br> - Shit!<br> - I guess he didn't talk.<br> - Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.<br> - Maybe he's got a new job.<br> Jesus! Not again.<br> Hashish.<br> You're kidding! Me?<br> I didn't sell him anything.<br> Rifki's lying. He's a liar!<br> Rifki!<br> Cigare, cigare, s'il vous plait.<br> Please, listen to me.<br> Excuse me, I've been wanting<br> to speak to you. You're an American?<br> Yes, America.<br> My name is Ahmet.<br> I studied philosophy at Harvard,<br> and also at Oxford.<br> I also studied in Vienna,<br> and now I study here.<br> They put me here.<br> They say I raped a little child.<br> They'll never let me go.<br> They won't let you go, either.<br> They tell you they'll let you go,<br> but in fact you stay.<br> You see, we all of us<br> come from a factory.<br> Sometimes the factory makes<br> bad machines that don't work.<br> The bad machines<br> don't know they're bad machines.<br> But the factory knows you are one<br> of the machines that doesn't work.<br> I think we've spoken enough<br> for today.<br> I wish you goodnight.<br> My God!<br> Billy!<br> What have they done to you?<br> Your family is fine.<br> Senator Buckley has made<br> a special plea on your behalf.<br> They've called you a pawn in the<br> game between Nixon and the Turks.<br> The letters are coming in.<br> People do care.<br> What?<br> Take it off.<br> - You'll just make yourself...<br> - Take it off.<br> S'il vous plait.<br> Billy...<br> I wish I could make it better<br> for you. Please, don't.<br> Don't.<br> - Susan.<br> - Yes, Billy.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Your father gave me this for you.<br> There's pictures of your mom<br> and dad, and Rob and Peg.<br> And in the back there's a picture<br> of your old friend Mr. Franklin.<br> Remember him? From the bank.<br> He's over in Greece now.<br> He bought a ticket.<br> I'll give it to them for you.<br> Don't count on them.<br> Don't count on anyone but yourself.<br> You're running out of time.<br> If you stay here, you'll die.<br> You've got to get yourself together.<br> You've got to get out of here.<br> Good morning, my American friend.<br> There will be trouble<br> if you go this way.<br> A good Turk<br> always walks to the right.<br> Left is Communist.<br> Right is good.<br> You must go the other way.<br> The other way is good.<br> Where are you going?<br> Why don't you walk the wheel?<br> What is the matter,<br> my American friend?<br> A bad machine<br> doesn't know he's a bad machine.<br> You still don't believe<br> you're a bad machine?<br> To know yourself is to know God.<br> The factory knows,<br> that's why they put you here.<br> - In time you'll know.<br> - I already know.<br> You are a bad machine, that's why<br> the factory keeps you here.<br> Do you know how I know?<br> I know because I'm from the factory.<br> I make the machines.<br> Max.<br> Max!<br> I'm going away.<br> I've come to say goodbye.<br> You see, if I stay here,<br> I'm going to die.<br> You'll die. Don't die, Max.<br> Please, don't die.<br> I'm going to come back for you.<br> You hang on for me.<br> You're not taking me<br> to the sanatorium!<br>
