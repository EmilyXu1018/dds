                        This is unbelievable!<br> Look at this!<br> There's no city like this in the world.<br> There never was!<br> You act like you've never been here before.<br> I don't get here often enough.<br> That's the problem.<br> Can you picture how drop-dead<br> gorgeous this city is in the rain?<br> Imagine this town in the '20s.<br> Paris in the '20s,<br> in the rain; the artists and writers.<br> Why does every city have to be in the rain?<br> What's wonderful about getting wet?<br> I mean, could you ever picture us<br> moving here after we're married?<br> Oh God, no.<br> I could never live out of the United States.<br> You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,<br> and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,<br> just, grinding out movie scripts...<br> I'll tell you something:<br> I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,<br> the pool, everything,<br> in a second.<br> I mean, look:<br> This is where Monet lived and painted.<br> We're 30 minutes from town.<br> Imagine the two of us settling here.<br> We could do it, I mean,<br> if my book turns out.<br> You're in love with a fantasy.<br> I'm in love with you.<br> We should get back to town.<br> We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.<br> Let's meet 'em.<br> There are our sightseers.<br> If I never see another charming<br> boulevard or bistro again, I...<br> - What a town!<br> - Yes. To visit.<br> I could see myself living here!<br> I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me."<br> I can see myself just strolling<br> along the Left Bank with a,<br> you know, baguette under my arm,<br> headed to Caf de Flore<br> to scribble away on my book.<br> What did Hemingway say?<br> He called it a "moveable feast."<br> In this traffic, nothing moves.<br> Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!<br> - Cheers!<br> - Cheers!<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well, I'll be perfectly frank.<br> I'm excited about this corporate merger between<br> our folks and the French company, but otherwise,<br> I'm not a big Francophile.<br> - John hates their politics.<br> - Certainly been no friend to the United States.<br> Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them<br> for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.<br> - The whole Bush, you know,...<br> - Oh, please. Let's not get into this<br> - bad discussion again and again.<br> - Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's<br> fine for your father and I to disagree.<br> That's what a democracy is.<br> Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,<br> and I happen to think you almost got to be<br> - like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...<br> - Okay. Okay!<br> But it doesn't mean we don't<br> respect each other's views, am I right?<br> - Can we talk about the wedding plans?<br> - Yes! Please.<br> Let's do that.<br> - Your father is just...<br> - Inez?<br> - Huh? Carol?<br> - Hi.<br> Oh my G... What are you doing here?<br> - Nice to see you! Hi.<br> - Hey!<br> - How are you?<br> - Good, thanks.<br> Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother<br> - and father, and, of course, you know Gail.<br> - Hi. Very nice to meet you.<br> Well, you... you didn't mention<br> you were going to be here.<br> No, it was sudden. Um...<br> Paul got invited to lecture at<br> the Sorbone.(sic.) Sorbonne.<br> Oh, how wonderful!<br> Well, uh, Dad's here on business,<br> and we just decided to<br> - freeload along. - Yes.<br> - Oh.<br> That's great. We can spend some time together.<br> Well, I think we have a<br> lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...<br> - What?<br> - Well, what are doing tomorrow?<br> - We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)<br> - Versailles...<br> - Versailles.<br> - Oh,<br> - I'm dying to see Versailles.<br> - Yeah!<br> But it's too...uh...<br> We're late...I think what we're...<br> Tomorrow we're locked in<br> to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.<br> - Oh no, that's just...<br> - Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...<br> You know I actually had<br> a professor that dined there,<br> and saw James Joyce!<br> Yeah, you know, like a<br> million years ago, and<br> apparently, Joyce was eating<br> sauerkraut and frankfurters.<br> Is that...<br> That's the end of the story?<br> Well, I mean it's not a story.<br> It's like a detailed...<br> - We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.<br> - Oh, good.<br> I hope you're not going to be<br> as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.<br> - How was I antisocial?<br> - Oh, please!<br> I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.<br> Well, I mean, they're your<br> friends, and I have to admit<br> I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.<br> He's brilliant.<br> You know, I had such a crush on him<br> in college, and Carol's very bright.<br> Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.<br> - Just a little bit.<br> - Uh, Gil,<br> I hardly think he'd be lecturing at<br> the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.<br> You should give him your book to read.<br> Oh, come on. Why?<br> No, because he could critique your writing,<br> and maybe show you why you're<br> having so much trouble.<br> I'm having trouble because<br> I'm a Hollywood hack<br> who never gave actual<br> literature a real shot.<br> - Until now.<br> - Please...Gil...<br> Honey, just promise me something.<br> If this book...doesn't pan out,<br> that you'll stop<br> eating your brains out,<br> and just go back to doing<br> what you do best.<br> I mean, the studios adore you.<br> You're in demand...<br> Do you really want to give<br> it all up just to struggle?<br> - Well...<br> - Mmm?<br> Mmm?<br> Why would you...want to do that?<br> I believe Louis moved his court here,<br> uh, in 1682.<br> Originally, all this was swampland.<br> In fact, if I'm not mistaken,<br> uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"<br> means, uh, something like,<br> - "terrain were the weeds have been pulled."<br> - Is that right?<br> Uh... The... uh, middle section here<br> uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.<br> Uh... The work, I believe, of...<br> uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)<br> - Yes.<br> - Uh...Mansart...I think...<br> - Manzard. (sic.)<br> - ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.<br> Yes, that's right.<br> I could get used to a summer home like this.<br> - I know you could.<br> - Me, too,<br> except, remember: in those days,<br> they only had baths,<br> and I'm definitely a shower man.<br> Where are you two planning on<br> moving after you get married?<br> Uh...Malibu.<br> - Really?<br> - We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.<br> I'm pushing for a little<br> attic in Paris with a skylight.<br> - La bowhem? (sic.)<br> - Yeah,<br> all that's missing is the tuberculosis.<br> Exactly. Thank you.<br> I mean, you know, the problem<br> is that he's not exactly sure<br> - he can write a novel.<br> - Really?<br> - Well...<br> - I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...<br> well, everyone loves your movies.<br> - Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...<br> - Wow.<br> Why don't you tell them about the lead<br> character that you're working on right now?<br> - Yes! - Oh, come on.<br> - I don't like to discuss my work.<br> Well, dear, you don't have to tell<br> them the whole plot, just the character.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - Okay.<br> He works in a nostalgia shop.<br> - What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?<br> - Oh, not one of those stores where they sell<br> Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?<br> - And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?<br> - Exactly.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Well, people who live in the past,<br> people who think that<br> their lives would be happier<br> if they lived in an earlier time.<br> And just which era<br> would you have preferred<br> to live in, Miniver Cheevy?<br> Paris in the '20s, in the rain.<br> - Wouldn't have been bad.<br> - And the rain was an acid rain.<br> Oh, I see! And no global warming,<br> no TV and suicide bombing,<br> and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!<br> Usual menu of clichd horror stories.<br> You know, nostalgia is denial.<br> - Denial of the painful present.<br> - Oh, whoa!<br> Gil is a complete romantic.<br> I mean, he would be<br> more than happy living in a<br> complete state of perpetual denial.<br> - Really?<br> - And the name for this fallacy<br> is called "golden-age thinking."<br> - Touch.<br> - Yeah, the erroneous notion that<br> a different time period is better<br> than the one one's living in.<br> It's a flaw in the Romantic<br> imagination of those people who...<br> who find it difficult to<br> cope with the depressive.<br> - Yes.<br> - This is the nicest ring we saw.<br> Diamonds for a wedding band.<br> That's the way you'd have to go.<br> And then, everyone will see<br> it in the back row when<br> he puts it on my finger.<br> Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!<br> - I only wish that...<br> - I don't want to keep going over it.<br> It's your choice. What can I say?<br> Gil is-- he's smart,<br> and he's very successful.<br> - He talks about giving that all up and moving here!<br> - Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.<br> Well, that frightens me.<br> This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.<br> A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.<br> Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.<br> - Is that true?<br> - It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,<br> if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?<br> Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.<br> Yes, she was an influence, though<br> Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.<br> - Camille? No.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes. Rose was the wife.<br> - No, he was never married to Rose.<br> Yes, he did marry Rose,<br> - in the last year their lives.<br> - I think you're mistaken.<br> Are you arguing with the guide?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.<br> Yeah, actually, she's right.<br> I recently read a two-volume<br> biography on Rodin, and<br> Rose was definitely the wife.<br> Camille, the mistress.<br> - Yeah. You read that? Where did you...<br> - Yeah, I just read it. I was surprised<br> because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,<br> the other way around.<br> It's an easy mistake.<br> So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.<br> - Oh, it'll be so French!<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Paul is an expert on French wine.<br> - You're joking. Really?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> When did you read the biography on Rodin?<br> Me? Why would I read<br> a biography on Rodin?<br> I will always take a California wine, but,<br> Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.<br> John, old boy, how are you, buddy?<br> Oh, hey! What're you doing here?<br> Come on. I can't stand that guy.<br> Um...How 'bout<br> - we try some more wine?<br> - Yes! Let's start here.<br> Now, which would you prefer here?<br> Well, I think we need to be scientific and just<br> start drinking them all again. I don't know.<br> - Why are your cheeks so red?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - They're not red.<br> - They're bright red.<br> Oh, maybe it's because of the<br> pheromones that you're giving off.<br> These pheromones are driving me mad!<br> - Stop it! Stop!<br> - Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.<br> - Yeah.<br> - It fuels the desire<br> but kills the performance,<br> according to the Bard.<br> Have you tasted the '61?<br> It is divine!<br> - Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...<br> - What?<br> - What's happening? What's happening?<br> - Slightly more tannic than the '59,<br> and I prefer a smoky feeling<br> to a fruity feeling.<br> So, Carol-- Carol and I<br> are gonna go dancing.<br> We heard of a great place. Interested?<br> - No... I don't want to be a killjoy,<br> - Come on!<br> but I need to get a little fresh air.<br> Oh, come on! Come on!<br> Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess<br> over where the fire exits are, then...<br> Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,<br> I'll share Paul with you.<br> I am very democratic,<br> and Paul is a marvelous dancer.<br> If it's OK with you,<br> I think I just want to take a little walk,<br> go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.<br> OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?<br> - You want to go?<br> - Well, yeah,<br> Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,<br> and I've been dying to go dancing,<br> and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.<br> - I'll take good care of her.<br> - OK.<br> I'll get a cab. Taxi!<br> - OK, but you should take a cab.<br> - No, I'm not taking a cab. I'm walking.<br> - No, you'll get lost.<br> - OK, I'm gonna walk.<br> Is he a good writer?<br> I mean, have you read his prose?<br> - Well, he won't let anybody.<br> - He won't let?<br> Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to<br> look over his novel and critique it for him.<br> - That would be great!<br> - Would you?<br> - You know, I think that's what he needs!<br> - Yeah?<br> - Well, it helps.<br> - To have it read by someone. Yeah!<br> - And you wouldn't pull any punches?<br> - Well, I certainly won't be letting<br> you know I won't do that.<br> -No.<br> I do that about you.<br> See, but, the problem is,<br> when it comes to his writing,<br> he has absolutely no respect<br> for anybody else's opinion.<br> Really?<br> Oh, excuse me! Parlez-vous...<br> Do you speak English?<br> - Uh...Htel Bristol?<br> - Parle pas anglais. Dsol.(We don't speak English. Sorry.)<br> (Hey! Get in! Come on!)<br> Montez! On va vous laisser!<br> (Get in! We're going to leave you!)<br> - What?<br> - Come on, guy.<br> - I didn't hear you. What?<br> - Come on!<br> Come on, guy!<br> Get in the car!<br> Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.<br> Vous allez me faire fatigu. Venir!<br> (You're making me tired. Come on!)<br> I can't understand you.<br> I'm a little drunk! I can't...<br> What is this, an old Peugeot?<br> I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.<br> Come on, have a drink. Come on!<br> - Come on, buddy! Come on!<br> - OK.<br> Give me your hand. OK.<br> Sit down, here.<br> - Let's go in. Paris, the city of lights.<br> - Allez! On y va!(Let's go! We're off!)<br> OK, now, where are<br> you guys taking me?<br> On va faire la fte!<br> (We're going to party!)<br> Yeah, this isn't quite fair,<br> 'cause I've already had a lot of red wine tonight.<br> Mais dtendez-vous! Vous voulez du champagne.<br> (Relax! Have some champagne.)<br> I do like champagne, yeah...<br> Sant! Sant!(Cheers! Cheers!)<br> - The night is young. Drink up!<br> - I'm drinking!<br> - Have a drink!<br> Yeah, drink up!<br> [Cole Porter's "Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love"]<br> Let's fall in love <br> In Spain, the best upper-sets do it <br> Lithuanians and Letts do it <br> Let's do it.

Scott!<br> - Yes, what it is, sweetheart?<br> - Here's a writer, from, um... where?<br> - California.<br> - Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?<br> Gil...the...<br> You have the same names as...<br> As what?<br> Scott Fitzgerald and...<br> Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.<br> Isn't she beautiful?<br> Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's...<br> that's a coincidence...like....uh...<br> You have a glazed look in your eye.<br> Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.<br> I...I...keep looking at the man playing piano, and I<br> believe it or not, recognize his<br> face from some old sheet music.<br> I know I can be one of the great writers<br> of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,<br> and then I hear the songs he writes,<br> and then I realize: I'll never write a great lyric,<br> - and my talent really lies in drinking.<br> - Sure does.<br> Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?<br> That's not possible...<br> So...um...<br> - What kind of books do you write?<br> - I...I...I'm working on a...um...<br> Where am I?<br> Oh, I'm sorry. Don't you know the host?<br> Some friends have gotten together<br> a little party for Jean Cocteau.<br> Hey, lady. What...<br> Are you kiddding me?<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> This is boring. I agree!<br> I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!<br> - Bricktop's?<br> - I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.<br> We. Are. All. Bored.<br> Let's do Bricktop's.<br> Why don't you tell Cole and Linda<br> to come with, and...um...<br> uh...Gil? You coming?<br> [Cole Porter's "You've Got That Thing"]<br> You got that thing - You got that thing <br> The thing that makes birds forget to sing <br> Yes, you've got that thing, that certain thing <br> You've got that charm, that subtle charm <br> that makes young farmers desert the farm <br> [Josphine Baker's "La Conga Blicoti"]<br> This is one of the finest establishments<br> in Paris. They do a diamond whiskey sour.<br> Bon soir, tous le monde!<br> (Good evening, everyone!)<br> Un peu tir de bourbon, s'il vous plat.<br> (A small shot of bourbon, please.)<br> Greetings and salutations.<br> You'll forgive me.<br> I've been mixing grain and grape.<br> Now, this a writer. uh...Gil. Yes?<br> - Gil...Gil Pender.<br> - Gil Pender.<br> Hemingway.<br> Hemingway?<br> You liked my book?<br> Liked? I loved!<br> All your work.<br> Yes, it was a good book,<br> because it was an honest book,<br> and that's what war does to men.<br> And there's nothing fine and noble<br> about dying in the mud,<br> unless you die gracefully,<br> and then it's not only noble, but brave.<br> Did you read my story?<br> What'd you think?<br> There was some fine writing in it,<br> but it was unfulfilled.<br> - I might've known you'd hate it.<br> - But darling, you're too sensitive.<br> You liked my story, but he hates me!<br> Please, old sport,<br> you make matters extremely difficult.<br> I'm jumpy. Suddenly I don't like<br> the atmosphere here any more.<br> Ah! Where're you going?<br> Para reunirse con mis amigos en Saint-Germain.<br> (To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.)<br> - He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.<br> - Zelda, sweetheart...<br> If you're going to stay here and drink<br> with him, I'm going with the toreador.<br> Would you bring her back<br> at a reasonable time?<br> - She'll drive you crazy, this woman.<br> - She's exciting,<br> and she has talent.<br> This month it's writing.<br> Last month it was something else.<br> You're a writer. You need time to write.<br> Not all this fooling around.<br> She's wasting you because she's<br> really a competitor. Don't you agree?<br> Me?<br> Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if<br> you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.<br> Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.<br> You're a writer. You make observations.<br> You were with them all night!<br> Could we not discuss my personal life in public?<br> She's jealous of his gift,<br> and it's a fine gift. It's rare.<br> - You like his work? You can speak for it.<br> - Stop it! Stop it.<br> You like Mark Twain?<br> I'm going to find Zelda.<br> I don't like the thought<br> of her with that Spaniard.<br> May I?<br> Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.<br> I think you can even make the case<br> that all modern American literature<br> comes from Huckleberry Finn.<br> - You box?<br> - No. Not really. No.<br> What're you writing?<br> - A novel.<br> - 'Bout what?<br> It's about a man who works<br> in a nostalgia shop.<br> What the hell is a nostalgia shop?<br> A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.<br> and... Does that sound terrible?<br> No subject is terrible if the story is true.<br> If the prose is clean and honest,<br> and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.<br> No good.<br> Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?<br> - What is it?<br> - Would you read it?<br> - Your novel?<br> - Yeah, it's like<br> looking for, you know, an opinion.<br> My opinion is I hate it.<br> I mean, you haven't even read it.<br> If it's bad, I'll hate it<br> because I hate bad writing,<br> and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.<br> You don't want the opinion of another writer.<br> Yeah. You know, it's just...<br> You know what it is?<br> I'm having a hard time,<br> you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.<br> Writers are competitive.<br> I'm not gonna be competitive with you.<br> You're too self-effacing.<br> It's not manly.<br> If you're a writer,<br> declare yourself the best writer!<br> But you're not, as long as I'm around.<br> Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?<br> No, I don't.<br> Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,<br> but I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> Yes?<br> I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.<br> She's the only one I trust with my writing.<br> You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?<br> - Give it to me.<br> - I'll bring it to you.<br> - And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.<br> - Great.<br> I'm gonna go get it.<br> I'm gonna...<br> I can't tell you how excited I am!<br> This is gonna be such a lift!<br> My heart is just racing right now!<br> I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.<br> Whoa, whoa, Gil!<br> Take it easy!<br> You had a big night.<br> Fitzgerald. Hemingway!<br> Papa!<br> You gotta...<br> OK, we never said where<br> we were gonna meet.<br> Good thing you didn't go last night.<br> You would've hated the music, and the crowd,<br> but I had fun.<br> What're you thinking about?<br> You seem like you're in a daze.<br> If I was to tell you that I spent<br> last night with Ernest Hemingway<br> and Scott Fitzgerald,<br> - what would you say?<br> - Is that what you were dreaming about?<br> Your literary idols?<br> Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...<br> What does that mean?<br> If I was with Hemingway,<br> and Fitzgerald,<br> and Cole Porter.<br> I'd be thinking brain tumor.<br> And when I tell you,<br> Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly<br> as we've come to know her through<br> everything we've read in books and articles.<br> You know, charming, but all over the map.<br> You know, she does not like<br> Hemingway one bit.<br> and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,<br> but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!<br> Come on! Get up! We should<br> quit the idle chatter,<br> because we're gonna be late.<br> You know, I'm not gonna...<br> I think I'm gonna stay here<br> and do some work on my novel,<br> 'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.<br> No. You can do that later.<br> Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!<br> Come look at these, Inez.<br> Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?<br> - Combien, monsieur? (How much, sir?)<br> - Dix-huit mille. (18,000)<br> - Merci. (Thanks.)<br> - What is that?<br> There a steal at $18,000.<br> $18,000 for this?<br> Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.<br> - So that's like 20. $20,000.<br> - Even more, I think. Yeah.<br> I know, but it's very hard<br> to find anything like this at home.<br> - She's right, Gil.<br> - I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,<br> and we're trying to keep expenses down,<br> so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.<br> Well, you get what you pay for.<br> - Nice.<br> - Cheap is cheap.<br> OK, you guys want to walk back?<br> Walk? No, it's starting to rain.<br> Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!<br> It's beautiful!<br> No, there's nothing beautiful<br> about walking in the rain.<br> No, don't forget.<br> We're taking you to dinner tonight.<br> Oh, right. Yes. Great.<br> And then, also, I have a big<br> surprise for you after dinner.<br> - What? No. I don't like surprises.<br> - I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.<br> - What is it?<br> - Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?<br> This is our last chance.<br> It's not that bad out.<br> Okay.<br> I don't understand.<br> Where are we going?<br> But, you made us rush through dinner,<br> and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.<br> Profiteroles? You're going to have<br> the most amazing adventure of your life!<br> - Where?<br> - Just, Inez, please.<br> - Why are you carrying that manuscript around?<br> - You'll see, and when you do,<br> your jaw is gonna drop.<br> OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,<br> so if I'm saying it's incredible,<br> - it's...<br> - OK.<br> - It's just, I don't understand!<br> - I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, you're about to find out,<br> and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't<br> acting more strange, when you find out.<br> - This is very...<br> - I know. I know.<br> Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,<br> but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.<br> I am tired from the gym and a massage,<br> so I'm gonna get this cab.<br> - Taxi!<br> - Inez, wait!<br> - Let's just wait a little longer.<br> - Look,<br> you want to walk the streets of Paris,<br> and take it in by night,<br> that's fine. You go ahead.<br> But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.<br> Come on, just 10 more minutes,<br> and then we can walk home.<br> If I'm asleep when you get in,<br> don't wake me up.<br> What am I doing wrong?<br> Unless she's right,<br> and I need to see a neurologist.<br> OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,<br> but not out of control.<br> Lost, you walk along...<br> this is the spot...<br> I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.<br> The clock struck midnight...<br> Hello!<br> Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.<br> Let me just jump in.<br> The assignment was to take the hill.<br> There were 4 of us.<br> lost his hand when a grenade went off<br> and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.<br> And he was young, and brave.<br> And the hill was soggy from days of rain,<br> and the hill sloped down toward a road,<br> and there were many German soldiers on the road.<br> And the idea was to aim for the first group,<br> and if our aim was true, we could delay them.<br> - Were you scared?<br> - Of what?<br> Getting killed?<br> You'll never write well<br> if you're afraid of dying.<br> - Do you?<br> - Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...<br> maybe my greatest fear, actually.<br> Well, that's something all men before<br> you have done. All men will do.<br> - I know. I know.<br> - Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?<br> Actually, my fiance is pretty sexy.<br> And when you make love to her,<br> you feel true, and beautiful<br> passion, and you, for at least that moment,<br> lose your fear of death.<br> No. That doesn't happen.<br> I believe that love that is true and real<br> creates a respite from death.<br> All cowardice comes from not loving,<br> or not loving well, which is the same thing.<br> And when the man who is brave and true<br> looks Death squarely in the face<br> like some rhino-hunters I know,<br> or Belmonte, who's truly brave.<br> It is because they love with sufficient<br> passion, to push death out of their minds,<br> until it returns, as it does, to all men.<br> And then you must make really good love again.<br> Think about it.<br> - Alice. How the hell are you?<br> - Hi!<br> Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.<br> - Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.(No. I don't agree.)<br> - Mais pourquoi? (But why?)<br> Parce-que... (Because...)<br> This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.<br> He's a young American writer.<br> I thought you two should know each other.<br> I'm glad you're here.<br> You can help decide which of us is right,<br> and which of us is wrong.<br> I was just telling Pablo that<br> this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.<br> It has a universality, but no objectivity.<br> Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.<br> (No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)<br> Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...<br> (You don't know Adriana. Look...)<br> Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.<br> (Look at the motion, the painting.)<br> C'est exactement ce qu'elle reprsente!<br> (It's exactly what she represents!)<br> Non. Tu n'as pas raison.(No. You're wrong.)<br> Look how he's done her:<br> dripping with sexual innuendo,<br> carnal to the point of smoldering,<br> and, yes, she's beautiful, but<br> it's a subtle beauty;<br> an implied sensuality.<br> I mean, what is your first<br> impression of Adriana?<br> Exceptionally lovely.<br> Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite, Pablo!<br> (Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)<br> Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.<br> 'Course...uh...<br> you can see why he's lost all objectivity.<br> He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.<br> A whore with volcanic appetites.<br> Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!<br> (No, no! It's true if you know her!)<br> Yes, avec toi, au priv,<br> (Yes, with you, in private,)<br> because she's your lover,<br> but we don't know her that way!<br> So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment<br> and turn her into an object of pleasure.<br> - It's more like a still-life than a portrait.<br> - Non.<br> Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.<br> (No. No. I do not agree.)<br> And what's this book of<br> yours I've been hearing about?<br> Is this it?<br> - Yeah, this is...uh...<br> - I'll take a look.<br> Have you read it, Hemingway?<br> No, this I leave to you.<br> You've always been a fine judge of my work.<br> " "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"<br> "and its products consisted of memories."<br> "What was prosaic and<br> even vulgar to one generation,"<br> "had been transmuted by<br> the mere passing of years"<br> "to a status at once magical and also camp."<br> I love it.<br> I'm already hooked.<br> Hooked!<br> I'll start it tonight,<br> but first, you and I<br> have something to talk about.<br> I've been waiting for two months<br> for a reply from that editor.<br> I sent him the piece you and I<br> looked at, plus four others,<br> plus four shorter pieces.<br> And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...<br> - Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.<br> - Right.<br> So were you really hooked<br> with those opening lines?<br> Oh, the past has always had a<br> great charisma for me.<br> Oh, me, too.<br> Great charisma for me.<br> I always say that I was born too late.<br> Mmm. Moi aussi.<br> (Mmm. Me, too.)<br> For me, la Belle poque Paris<br> would have been perfect.<br> - Really? Better than now?<br> - Yes.<br> Another whole sensibility,<br> the street lamps, the kiosques,<br> the...horse and carriages,<br> and Maxim's then.<br> You speak very good English.<br> - No, not really.<br> - No, you do!<br> How long have you been dating Picasso?<br> My God, did I just say that?<br> Pardon?<br> I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....<br> Were you born in Paris?<br> I was born in Bordeaux.<br> I moved here to study fashion.<br> But you don't want to hear all this.<br> Yes, I do.<br> Yes, continue.<br> You moved here to study fashion...<br> I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,<br> and I fell in love with Paris,<br> and also,<br> a very dark-eyed, haunted<br> Jewish-Italian painter.<br> And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,<br> I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,<br> and it was a beautiful six months.<br> M..M...Modigliani?<br> You lived with...<br> You lived with Modigliani?<br> You asked me,<br> so I'm telling you my sad story.<br> With Braque, though, there was another woman.<br> Many.<br> And now,<br> with Pablo.<br> I mean, he's married,<br> but...<br> every day, it's on-again, off-again.<br> I don't know how any woman<br> can stay with him. He's so difficult.<br> My God, you take "art groupie"<br> to a whole new level!<br> - Pardon?<br> - Nothing. I was just saying that...<br> But tell me about yourself.<br> - What? Well, what can I say...<br> - So, have you come to Paris to write?<br> Because, you know,<br> these days, so many Americans<br> feel the need to move here.<br> Isn't Hemingway attractive?<br> I love his writing.<br> I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.<br> Oh, you must stay here.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for<br> - writers, artists.<br> - I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.<br> And,<br> I didn't fall in love madly with your book...<br> - Really?<br> - ...so I want to hear the rest of it.<br> - You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...<br> - Pender?<br> - Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?<br> - Uh...yeah.<br> I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.<br> Where can I reach you?<br> Why don't I drop back by, instead of you<br> trying to find me, if that's all right?<br> - We run an open house.<br> - Are you coming with us?<br> I wish that I could.<br> I cant, but<br> hopefully I'll see you again eventually.<br> That would be nice.<br> - Let's go!<br> - One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius<br> who's great, but he's no Mir.<br> I'm Gil Pender.<br> I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.<br> Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.<br> I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!<br> Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.<br> Little old Gil Pender has his novel<br> with Gertrude. Stein.<br> Boy, that girl was so...<br> lovely.<br> Well, it's a shame you two didn't<br> come to the movies with us last night,<br> We saw a wonderfully<br> funny American film.<br> Who was in it?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I forget the name.<br> Wonderful but forgettable.<br> That sounds like a picture I've seen.<br> I probably wrote it.<br> Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and<br> utterly lacking in any wit or believability,<br> - but John and I laughed in spite of all that.<br> - Have we been down this way yet?<br> Was it?<br> What time did you get in last night?<br> Not that late...uh...<br> I was...uh...<br> I'm really finding these midnight strolls<br> great for me creatively,<br> without the distractions of the day.<br> I'll probably end up going on another little<br> - hike tonight.<br> - Well, we'll see.<br> Yeah. We'll see.<br> Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.<br> [Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me"]<br> ...that simply mystifies me <br> Tell me why should it be <br> You have the power to hypnotize me <br> Vous aimez?<br> (You like?)<br> Yes. Very beautiful.<br> - Oh. You're American.<br> - Yeah.<br> You like Cole Porter?<br> I do. I'm a big fan.<br> I like to<br> kind of think I'm a member<br> of Linda and Cole's inner circle.<br> I'm kidding.<br> Very pretty lyrics.<br> - Very amusing.<br> - Charming.<br> Gil?<br> - Gil? Hi.<br> - Yeah? Yes.<br> - Yeah. We should go.<br> - We're going now?<br> Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol<br> at the museum for the private showing.<br> - OK. Yeah. Right.<br> You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,<br> so you'll find it enlightening, I think.<br> Yeah. OK.<br> Let's get some culture.<br> The juxtaposition of color is amazing.<br> This man was the real father<br> of abstract expressionism.<br> I take that back.<br> Maybe Turner.<br> I mean, I love Turner,<br> but, I just find this...<br> overwhelming.<br> If I'm not mistaken,<br> it took him 2 years to complete this.<br> He worked out of Giverny,<br> where he was frequently...<br> I heard that Monet,<br> one of the things that he used to try to...<br> Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.<br> Well, he was frequently<br> visited by Caillebotte,<br> an artist who I personally feel was underrated.<br> Ah. Now.<br> Here's a superb Picasso.<br> If I'm not mistaken, he painted<br> this marvelous portrait of his<br> French mistress<br> Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.<br> Paul, I'm gonna have to<br> differ with you on this one.<br> - Really.<br> - Gil, just pay attention.<br> You might learn something.<br> OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,<br> this was a failed attempt to capture<br> a young French girl named Adriana,<br> from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,<br> who came to Paris to study<br> costume design for the theater.<br> I'm pretty sure she had an affair<br> with Modigliani, then Braque,<br> which is how Pablo met her.<br> Picasso.<br> Of course, what you don't get<br> from this portrait<br> is the subtlety,<br> and her beauty.<br> She was just a knock-out.<br> What have you been smoking?<br> I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,<br> it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement<br> on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.<br> He's distracted by the fact<br> that she was a<br> absolute volcano in the sack.<br> Too rich for me.<br> Where'd Gil run off to?<br> Work.<br> Been walking around Paris. You know,<br> the way the city's lit up at night<br> allegedly inspires him, so...<br> But that's OK,<br> because I'm going dancing with Paul.<br> Where's Carol?<br> uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,<br> so I'll see you guys later.<br> Thanks for dinner, Daddy.<br> Bye, sweetie.<br> Where do you think<br> Gil goes every night?<br> You heard her.<br> He walks, and gets ideas.<br> - You sound skeptical.<br> - No.<br> I've seen what he earns,<br> but sometimes I think he's got a...<br> got a... part missing,<br> and I didn't like his remark about<br> Tea Party Republicans.<br> They are decent<br> people trying to take back the country.<br> They are not<br> crypto-fascist<br> airhead zombies.<br> You hear him say that?<br> Nevertheless, I don't think<br> your idea of having him followed<br> - is very practical.<br> - No?<br> I'd like to know where he goes every night.<br> Well, we know one thing:<br> he doesn't go dancing.<br> Oh! Excuse me!<br> - Is this gentleman bothering you?<br> - Hello, Gil!<br> Hey! How are you?<br> I was hoping we'd see you here.<br> - What a great party!<br> - Oh, good.<br> - It's nice to see you here.<br> - Thank you.<br> Oh, Delfine?<br> - Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?<br> - Sure, sure.<br> Bon soir, Madame.<br> (Good evening, Madame.)<br> - What a surprise!<br> - It was just a total fluke.<br> I was at Gertrude Stein's,<br> she's almost finished with my novel,<br> and I run into this guy.<br> Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.<br> He says he's on his way over here,<br> come on over. Oh, I'm not<br> going to crash the Fitzgeralds,<br> but then he said you'd be here.<br> You and Pablo, and...<br> Oh, Pablo's home.<br> - We had a...bit of a quarrel.<br> - Oh no!<br> - You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.<br> - Oh, yeah!<br> Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.<br> Isn't this a wonderful<br> place to throw a party?<br> - It's so great!<br> - Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!<br> - I want to show you something. Come with me.<br> - OK.<br> - So, what about your book?<br> - It's coming along. Yeah!<br> Look at that!<br> - Wow!<br> - It's from the turn of the century.<br> Isn't it beautiful?<br> It's my favorite era.<br> I love it so much.<br> Everything was so perfect.<br> It's so nice to see you tonight.<br> - I was hoping to...<br> - It's so nice to see you!<br> Voil, ma petite Adriana!<br> (There she is, my little Adriana!)<br> Isn't this little Parisian<br> dream a moveable feast?<br> Mark my words.<br> I'm going to steal you away<br> from that fugitive from<br> Mlaga one way or another.<br> Between Belmonte and myself,<br> whom would you choose?<br> Vous tes tous deux parfaits.<br> (You are both perfect.)<br> But he has more courage.<br> He faces death more often, and<br> more directly, and if you chose him,<br> I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.<br> Ella ha elegido Pablo.<br> (She chose Pablo.)<br> Yes, she's chosen Picasso,<br> but Pablo thinks<br> women are only to sleep<br> with or to paint.<br> What about you?<br> I think a woman is equal<br> to a man in courage.<br> Have you ever shot<br> a charging lion?<br> Never.<br> Would you like to know<br> how that feels?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - You ever hunted?<br> - No.<br> - You?<br> Only for bargains.<br> Tommonos otra copita.<br> (Let's take another drink.)<br> You know, it's so loud,<br> I wonder if we can go some place<br> - where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?<br> - Sure! Bye.<br> Who wants a fight?<br> Well, I hope it was nothing<br> serious with you and Pablo.<br> He's moody and possessive.<br> Artists are like children.<br> Well, you certainly understand why<br> all these guys want to paint you,<br> 'cause you have just about<br> one of the best faces ever.<br> - It's so interesting...<br> - Oh?<br> - You're interesting, too, in a lost way.<br> - Lost?<br> Well, I guess I am lost.<br> Tell me more about your book.<br> My book is kind of a...<br> You know what?<br> I couldn't care less about my book tonight.<br> I just want to walk around Paris with you.<br> I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.<br> That's putting it mildly.<br> I can never decide whether<br> Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.<br> No, you can't.<br> You couldn't pick one. I mean,<br> I can give you a checkmate<br> argument for each side.<br> You know, I sometimes think,<br> "How's anyone gonna come up with a<br> book, or a painting, or a<br> symphony or a sculpture that can<br> compete with a great city?"<br> You can't, 'cause, like,<br> you look around, every...<br> every street, every boulevard<br> is its own special art form.<br> And when you think that in the cold,<br> violent, meaningless universe,<br> that Paris exists, these lights...<br> I mean, come on, there's nothing<br> happening on Jupiter or Neptune,<br> but from way out in space<br> you can see these lights,<br> the cafs, people drinking, and singing...<br> I mean, for all we know,<br> Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.<br> - Vous tes un pote.(You are a poet.)<br> - Aw, come on.<br> It's just... You're very kind,<br> but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.<br> Although I was on a pretty good roll there.<br> See anything you like?<br> Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit<br> I'm attracted to all of them.<br> I like cheap sexy.<br> That makes me shallow.<br> When I was in Catholic school,<br> one weekend<br> my roommate and I,<br> we paid a girl from Pigalle<br> to come and teach us all her tricks.<br> - Honestly?<br> - Yeah.<br> Wow. That's...<br> That's...That's...<br> I'm going to be thinking about that one.<br> I love walking with you.<br> - You look amazing.<br> - Thank you.<br> God, is that who I think it is?<br> What is she doing here,<br> staring into the water?<br> Oh my God!<br> Zelda, what are you doing?!<br> - Please? I don't want to live!<br> - Stop!<br> - What is it?<br> - Scott and that beautiful countess.<br> They were-- It was so obvious<br> they were whispering about me,<br> and the more they drank,<br> the more he fell in love with her!<br> He...Scott loves only you.<br> - I can tell you that with absolute certainty.<br> - No.<br> - He's tired of me!<br> - You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.<br> - How?<br> - Trust me. I know.<br> - Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...<br> - My skin hurts!<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!<br> Don't do that!<br> - Here. Take this.<br> - What is this?<br> It's a Valium.<br> It'll make you feel better.<br> - You carry medicine?<br> - No, not normally.<br> It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,<br> I've been having panic attacks,<br> but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.<br> I've never heard of Valium.<br> What is this?<br> It's the...pill of the future.<br> You never said you were getting married.<br> Yeah. You know,<br> it's still a....<br> ways in the future.<br> - Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.<br> - Thank you.<br> I think you'd like Inez.<br> She has a...<br> has a very sharp sense of humor, and<br> she's attractive. She doesn't say<br> that we agree on everything, but...<br> But the important things.<br> Yeah, or...actually,<br> maybe the small things. The...<br> Sometimes there's a little bit<br> of a disconnect with the big things.<br> She wants to live in Malibu, and<br> wants me to work in Hollywood, and....<br> But I will say that we both like<br> Indian food.<br> Not all Indian food, but the...<br> you know...the pita bread.<br> We both like pita bread.<br> I guess it's called naan.<br> I should go.<br> Pablo will be missing me.<br> - Come on. I'll walk you home.<br> - No. No. No.<br> Just finish your drink.<br> I live just around the corner.<br> - No. Come on. I'm not gonna...<br> - Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,<br> but thank you for the evening.<br> Bye.<br> Monsieur? C'est un dommage.<br> (Sir? It's a shame.)<br> C'est un dommage.<br> (It's a shame.)<br> We met, earlier tonight...<br> At the party!<br> Dal, s?<br> (Dal, yes?)<br> - Yes...<br> - Dal!<br> - I remember!<br> - Dal. Ya.<br> Un bouteille de vin rouge!<br> (A bottle of red wine!)<br> It can't be...<br> Yeah....<br> So?<br> Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plat.<br> (Another glass for this man, please.)<br> I love the language!<br> The French!<br> The waiters? No.<br> You like the shape of the rhinoceros?<br> The rhinoceros? Uh...<br> Haven't really thought about it.<br> I paint the rhinoceros.<br> I paint you.<br> S. Your sad eyes.<br> Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,<br> with one tear.<br> Yes! And in your tear,<br> another face.<br> The Christ's face!<br> Yes, in the rhinoceros.<br> Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...<br> a very perplexing situation.<br> Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!<br> (Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)<br> My friends.<br> This... Seor Buuel.<br> - Buuel?<br> - S. Buuel...and...Mr. Man Ray.<br> - Man Ray? My Gosh!<br> - How 'bout that?<br> This is Pen-der. Pen-der.<br> Pender!<br> - Yes. And I am Dal!<br> - Dal. Yes.<br> You have to remember.<br> Pender is in a perplexing situation.<br> It sounds so crazy to say.<br> You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but<br> I have to tell someone. I'm...<br> from a...<br> a different time. Another era.<br> The future. OK? I come...<br> from the 2000th millenium to here.<br> I get in a car, and I slide through time.<br> Exactly correct.<br> You inhabit two worlds.<br> - So far, I see nothing strange.<br> - Why?<br> Yeah, you're surrealists!<br> But I'm a normal guy.<br> See, in one life,<br> I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.<br> At least, I think I love her.<br> Christ! I better love her!<br> I'm marrying her!<br> The rhinoceros makes love<br> by mounting the female.<br> But...<br> is there a difference<br> in the beauty between two<br> rhinoceroses?<br> There is another woman?<br> Adriana. Yes, and I'm...<br> very drawn to her.<br> I find her extremely alluring.<br> The problem is that other men,<br> great artists - geniuses -<br> also find her alluring,<br> and she finds them.<br> So, there's that...<br> A man in love with a woman<br> from a different era.<br> I see a photograph.<br> I see a film.<br> I see an insurmountable problem.<br> I see...<br> ...a rhinoceros.<br> Did you get any work done last night?<br> Yeah...I just....<br> I'm starting to think that maybe my<br> book is too realistic.<br> That I'm missing some chances<br> to let my imagination kind of<br> go crazy, and not be so<br> damn logical.<br> - Why do you always look so good in the morning?<br> - No. No. No. No!<br> - We have to get dressed!<br> - Just for a second!<br> Come here! I've been working like a demon.<br> I gotta get this stuff done, but<br> I can't resist you any more.<br> You're so fetching in the morning.<br> Paul said we have to go to the countryside.<br> You know? He said he's taking us<br> to this beautiful little inn for lunch.<br> But, I mean, if you don't want to go,<br> don't go.<br> I'm not missing it because of you.<br> Hello! Bonjour!<br> - Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.<br> - Hello.<br> OK, now, I understand<br> he loved his wife<br> and he also loved his mistress.<br> - Yes.<br> - But do you think that's possible,<br> to love two women at once?<br> Well, he loved them both,<br> but in a different way.<br> You know...<br> That's very...<br> That's very French.<br> You guys are way...<br> you know...much...<br> more evolved in that department<br> than we are.<br> Do you remember me?<br> I was in the...<br> - was in the group that...<br> - Yes!<br> The group with the pedantic gentleman.<br> Pedantic? Yes.<br> That's a perfect word.<br> Here is ... his photo.<br> I want to know where<br> he goes each night.<br> What is your suspicion? Hm?<br> He's engaged to my daughter.<br> To marry. I want to make sure<br> that she's making the right decision.<br> Naturally, discretion is paramount.<br> Well, you've come to the<br> right place, Monsieur.<br> Monsieur Tisserant will personally<br> keep track of the gentleman,<br> and report about his whereabouts at night.<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!<br> Hey! Thank you for stopping.<br> - Gil Pender.<br> - Tom Eliot.<br> Tom Eliot?<br> Tom Stearns Eliot?<br> T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?<br> - Pender.<br> - Prufrock's like my mantra!<br> OK. Sorry. Sorry.<br> Listen. Where I come from,<br> people measure out their lives<br> with coke spoons.<br> - Hello? Ms. Stein?<br> - Oh, Pender.<br> I'll get to your book in a moment.<br> I finished it.<br> We're just in the middle<br> of a little personal crisis.<br> Oh, OK. Should I come back?<br> I don't want to interrupt.<br> No, it's no secret.<br> Adriana has left Pablo,<br> and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.<br> Saba que tena obsesin con este fanfarrn!<br> (I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!)<br> Ya hemos hablado de todo esto!<br> (We talked about all this!)<br> Estoy segura de que ella regresar muy devoto.<br> (I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)<br> Muy devoto. Oh, he took her hunting kudu,<br> but she'll be back to him.<br> The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when<br> you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.<br> Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.<br> - What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?<br> - Now, about your book,<br> it's very unusual, indeed.<br> I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.<br> We all fear death,<br> and question our place in the universe.<br> The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,<br> but to find an antidote for<br> the emptiness of existence.<br> You have a clear and lively voice.<br> Don't be such a defeatist.<br> Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're<br> going to be dining formal tomorrow night.<br> I forgot to tell you, actually.<br> Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.<br> Why not?<br> I don't understand it!<br> Because, he writes.<br> He rewrites.<br> He rewrites the rewrites, you know?<br> He says, "Picasso never left his studio."<br> I said, "Gil, you have absolutely<br> nothing in common with Picasso."<br> He just looks at me.<br> Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.<br> [Cole Porter's "Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love"]<br> And that's why birds do it <br> Bees do it <br> Even educated fleas do it <br> Let's do it<br> Let's fall in love <br> In Spain, the best upper-sets do it <br> Lithuanians and Letts do it <br> You have any Cole Porter?<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> - I remember you.<br> - Yeah?<br> - He was your friend.<br> - Cole Porter? Yeah.<br> And don't forget about Linda.<br> She was a friend, too.<br> - You realize I was kidding?<br> - Yeah. I did realize.<br> You're a bit young.<br> Yeah. You seem a bit young<br> to be so familiar with his work.<br> It's because he wrote<br> many songs about Paris.<br> Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was<br> in love with your hometown, or something.<br> - Are you a Parisian?<br> - Yes, monsieur.<br> "Yes, monsieur." Feel free to call me Gil.<br> - What do I owe you?<br> - For this?<br> - Dix-huit Euros. (18)<br> - OK.<br> Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it <br> Let's do it<br> Let's fall in love <br> Cold Cape Cod clams<br> 'gainst their wish, do it <br> Even lazy jellyfish do it <br> Let's do it, Let's fall in love <br> Can you translate this?<br> Do you speak any English?<br> OK. Alright, thank you.<br> "That Paris exists,<br> and anyone could choose to live"<br> "anywhere else in the world,<br> will always be a mystery to me."<br> "Dinner with...Dinner with Pablo,<br> and Henri Matisse."<br> "Pablo is the greater artist,<br> but Matisse is the greater painter."<br> "Paris in the summer.<br> What it must have been like,"<br> "to sit opposite one's<br> lover at Maxim's, in its..."<br> "in its...um...best time."<br> "I'm in love with an American<br> writer I just met,"<br> "named Gil Pender."<br> "That immediate magic one hears<br> about happened to me."<br> "I know that both Picasso and<br> Hemingway are in love with me,"<br> "but for whatever...inexplicable..."<br> - inexplicable...reason...the heart has,<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> "I am drawn by Gil."<br> "Perhaps because he seems nave and unassuming."<br> "As always in this sad life,"<br> "he's about to marry a woman named Inez."<br> "I had a dream where he came to me"<br> "and brought me a little gift.<br> Earrings, they were,"<br> "and we made love."<br> Earrings...<br> Earrings....<br> Whoa! Oh my God!<br> What are you guys doing?<br> Daddy had chest pains.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.<br> - We can't take that chance.<br> - You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.<br> Yeah. Right.<br> They put a balloon in me.<br> Big deal.<br> - Balloon?<br> - I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.<br> Don't call the doctor!<br> Gil, why are you so dressed up?<br> Me? No, no, no, I'm not.<br> I've been writing.<br> I was just doing a little writing.<br> Wh...You dress up and<br> put on cologne to write?<br> No, no. I jumped in the shower,<br> just for a second. You know<br> how I think better in the shower,<br> and I get the positive ions going in there?<br> So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel<br> when Daddy just...<br> he went pale as a ghost.<br> - That's terrible!<br> - I mean, it was so scary, so we just<br> - turned right around and came back.<br> - Yeah. You had to.<br> John, is there anything I can get,<br> for your color to me looks<br> - like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.<br> - Naw, I'm fine.<br> I'm sure it's the<br> beef bourguignon she made me have.<br> - What is that?<br> - Where?<br> - That in your hand.<br> - Nothing.<br> - That was a present!<br> - I know. I know.<br> I mean, it's not...It...It is!<br> - Pour moi? (For me?)<br> - Yes.<br> It's not...incredible....<br> It's from the flea market.<br> - Well, can I open it?<br> - No, no no,<br> That's what I'm saying.<br> Honey, it's for a special dinner<br> that we're gonna have,<br> then I'm going to give it to you.<br> - Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...<br> - Well...<br> - ...that moonstone necklace?<br> - But I thought you liked the moon?<br> Because it's understated, but elegant.<br> That's what you always say.<br> Cheap is cheap,<br> is what I always say.<br> Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.<br> I've never actually even worn it.<br> I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.<br> - Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.<br> - Well...<br> - they are...<br> - A little simple.<br> I think... I thought<br> you loved their simplicity.<br> Yeah, that's the problem.<br> They're too simple.<br> Well, what do I know?<br> Too simple.<br> Where are my pearl earrings?<br> Did...Did you bring them?<br> I don't even remember you packing them.<br> Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!<br> No, you didn't.<br> Oh, they must've fallen out!<br> Both of them?<br> Gil, my ears are pierced.<br> Inez, I told you to keep<br> everything in the hotel safe!<br> - Do you think it was the maid?<br> - It's always the maid.<br> I...I know I saw them<br> here this morning.<br> Well, I would report the theft right away.<br> You know, she was so snotty<br> yesterday when I asked her...<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not<br> jump to any conclusions, OK?<br> - You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.<br> - Yes, I'd like to report a theft.<br> - Shh, Inez, no!<br> - Could you call the house detective?<br> - Send him up. Thank you.<br> - This is turning into a witch hunt!<br> You don't do this to people!<br> Yes, you do,<br> if they've stolen.<br> I didn't like that maid.<br> I didn't like her from the beginning.<br> She was sweet. She was pleasant.<br> She was upbeat!<br> You always take the<br> side of the help, as usual!<br> That's why Daddy says you're a communist.<br> Bon soir. (Good evening.)<br> I'm Doctor Grard.<br> - Do you want some more water?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - He's had angioplasty.<br> - I didn't need it.<br> Look! Are these them?<br> I don't know.<br> - Where did you find them?<br> - They were just in the bathroom.<br> - In the bathroom?<br> - Yeah. On the sink.<br> What the hell were they<br> doing in the bathroom?<br> I don't know.<br> They were just...<br> But maybe you dropped them, and<br> when you were putting them away,<br> and the housekeeper must've picked them up.<br> and placed them there, out in<br> the open where we could see them easily.<br> That was really thoughtful of her.<br> I didn't drop them.<br> I wouldn't drop them.<br> The important thing is<br> they're not stolen.<br> C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au prsent.<br> (It's one of your best, until now.)<br> J'ai parl Leo. Je pense qu'il va l'acheter<br> (I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.)<br> Oh, Pender!<br> I was just telling Matisse<br> we're going to buy one of his<br> paintings for our personal collection.<br> I think 500 Francs is fair.<br> Yeah, I think that sounds fair.<br> You know, I was wondering if<br> maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.<br> - What have we got here?<br> - Yeah. Oh.<br> OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over<br> of the first few chapters of my book,<br> and if you could just tell me if I'm<br> heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.<br> - Leave it with me.<br> - OK. Great.<br> and have you heard from Hemingway?<br> Oh, they've been back for days, now.<br> The trip didn't work out.<br> I knew they wouldn't hit it off.<br> It's over. With Picasso, too.<br> She's at Deyrolle, by herself.<br> By herself?<br> Oh, one of those crazy<br> Surrealist painters is getting married.<br> They're doing it up there.<br> She'll be glad to see you.<br> Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...<br> (Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)<br> Oh. What are you doing here?<br> I came to find you.<br> - You did?<br> - Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but<br> let's just say, as a writer,<br> I'm pretty good at<br> picking up on vibrations from people-<br> women in particular.<br> I sense that there are<br> some complicated feelings, maybe,<br> that you have for me.<br> Aren't you gonna get married?<br> Well, everything's a little<br> up in the air right now.<br> I don't know what is gonna happen.<br> Is there some place that we<br> can talk? Maybe more quiet?<br> - Sure.<br> - Come on.<br> Oh, Mr. Buuel!<br> I had a nice idea<br> for a movie for you.<br> - Yes?<br> - A group of people attend a<br> very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,<br> when they try to leave the room, they can't.<br> Why not?<br> They just can't seem to exit the door.<br> - B...But why?<br> - Well, momento,<br> when they're forced to stay together,<br> the veneer of civilization<br> quickly fades away,<br> and what you're left with is<br> who they really are: animals.<br> But I don't get it.<br> Why don't they just<br> walk out of the room?<br> All I'm saying is just think about.<br> Who knows?<br> Maybe when you're shaving one day,<br> it'll tickle your fancy.<br> I don't understand.<br> What's holding them in the room?<br> What are you doing?<br> I don't know!<br> I did feel,<br> for a minute there,<br> while I was doing it, like I was immortal.<br> But you look so sad.<br> Because life is too mysterious.<br> This is the time we live in.<br> Everything moves so fast.<br> Life is noisy and complicated.<br> I've always been a logical person.<br> I've never<br> I never acted too crazy.<br> I didn't stay here.<br> When I first came out here,<br> I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.<br> I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.<br> Don't laugh. I just want to...<br> I feel like I just want to let it go.<br> - Here.<br> - Oh!<br> Oh! This is...<br> This is remarkable!<br> Go on. Here, put in on.<br> They're so beautiful!<br> Look!<br> Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!<br> (Sir, Miss, away we go!)<br> - Qui est vous? (Who are you?)<br> - Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard. (Come up. We're too late)<br> - Allez!<br> - Come on! Come on!<br> Oh, mon Dieu,<br> this is so beautiful!<br> It's unbelievable!<br> All the pictures I've seen...<br> Here it is: La Belle poque!<br> Wow! I don't know<br> what it is about this city!<br> It's like, I've got to write a note<br> to the Chamber of Commerce.<br> Bon soir!<br> (Good evening!)<br> Bon soir! Bienvenue.<br> (Good evening! Welcome.)<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!<br> (Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)<br> Tellement avant-garde!<br> (So ahead of the time!)<br> S'il vous plat, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fte!<br> (Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)<br> Champagne.<br> Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,<br> I told you about this place,<br> and the Belle poque,<br> and here we are!<br> I don't know why,<br> but I have this feeling that...<br> I don't know, like I can't...<br> believe my luck.<br> Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.<br> You lead the way.<br> Look!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Pablo admires him so much!<br> - I have to say hello.<br> - No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.<br> - Come with me! I'm nervous.<br> - Really? OK.<br> But, we know he's a lonely man.<br> - I'm sure he would love some company.<br> - OK, let's go.<br> Monsieur Lautrec?<br> - Oui? (Yes?)<br> - Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.(Good evening. We are great fans.)<br> - Merci, Madame. (Thank you, Madame.)<br> - Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre? (May we offer you a drink?)<br> Je serais enchante. Prenez un sige.<br> (I would be delighted. Have a seat.)<br> He's asking us to sit down with him.<br> This much French I do<br> understand, and the gesture.<br> Vous tes Americain?<br> (You are American?)<br> Yes, I'm an American.<br> Je vous devine l'accent.(I could tell from the accent.)<br> - Yeah. Oui. Oui.<br> Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.<br> (Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)<br> - I love your drawings, also.<br> - Bon soir!<br> - Merci.<br> Savez que moi je prsenter Monsieur Gauginand Monsieur Degas.<br> (May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)<br> - Bon soir.<br> - Enchante.<br> - Bon soir. Enchante.<br> - Paul Gaugin.<br> - Yes! Yes! Yes!<br> See the sketch he's made?<br> Nobody can draw like this today.<br> Not Picasso. Not Matisse.<br> Unbelievable. Parlez-vous anglais?<br> - Non, monsieur. (No, sir.)<br> - Il parle un petit peu.(He speaks a little.)<br> Non, non. I speak well. Parle trs bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir?<br> (No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)<br> Degas and I were just<br> talking about how this...<br> um...this...cette...gnration est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.<br> (...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)<br> He said...He says that<br> this generation is empty,<br> and has no imagination.<br> Better to have lived during the...<br> la Renaissance.<br> No! This is the golden age.<br> - Non.<br> - C'est l'ge d'or!(It's the golden age!)<br> Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.<br> (Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)<br> Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?<br> (What is it you do?)<br> J'tudie la haute-couture.<br> (I study high fashion.)<br> C'est pour a vous tes (That's why you're dressed like that.)<br> Je comprends maintenant!<br> (I understand now!)<br> Les vtements tres jeune.<br> (The youthful clothes.)<br> Voulez vous de lui prsenter Richard?<br> (Would you introduce her to Richard?)<br> - Ah, oui! (Oh, yes!)<br> - Ah, oui. He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.<br> He's looking for someone<br> to do costumes for the new ballet.<br> So, vous intresse?<br> (So, you're interested?)<br> - Ballet costumes?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh my God! I...<br> I don't live here.<br> I mean, I do, but I don't. I...<br> It's best not to go<br> into too many details. We're...<br> We're temporarily<br> passing through.<br> Can I speak with you a minute?<br> Permite?<br> (May I?)<br> Enchant..<br> Wow, it didn't take<br> Gaugin long to start steaming in.<br> Let's never go back to the '20s!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - We should stay here.<br> It's the start of La Belle poque!<br> It's the greatest, most<br> beautiful era Paris has ever known.<br> Yeah, but about the '20s,<br> and the Charleston,<br> and the Fitzgeralds,<br> and the Hemingways?<br> I mean, I love those guys.<br> But it's the present.<br> It's dull.<br> Dull?<br> It's not my present.<br> I'm from 2010.<br> What do you mean?<br> I dropped in on you the same way<br> we're dropping in on the 1890s.<br> You did?<br> I was trying to escape my present<br> the same way you're trying to escape yours,<br> to a golden age.<br> Surely you don't think<br> the '20s are a golden age!<br> Well, yeah. To me they are.<br> But I'm from the '20s, and I'm<br> telling you the golden age is La Belle poque.<br> And look at these guys. I mean, to them,<br> their golden age was the Renaissance.<br> You know, they're trade Belle poque<br> to be painting alongside<br> Titian and Michelango.<br> And those guys probably imagined<br> life was a lot better<br> when Kublai Khan was around.<br> You see, I'm having an insight right now.<br> It's a minor one, but<br> it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.<br> - What dream?<br> - I had a dream the other night, where<br> it was like a nightmare,<br> where I ran out of Zithromax.<br> And then I went to the dentist,<br> and he didn't have any Novocaine.<br> You see what I'm saying?<br> These people don't have any antibiotics.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Adriana, if you stay here,<br> and this becomes your present,<br> then, pretty soon, you'll start<br> imagining another time was really your,<br> you know, was really the golden time.<br> That's what the present is.<br> That it's a little unsatisfying,<br> because life's a little unsatisfying.<br> That's the problem with writers.<br> You are so full of words.<br> But I am more emotional,<br> and I'm going stay,<br> and live in Paris' most glorious time.<br> You made a choice to leave<br> Paris once, and you regretted it.<br> Yeah, I did regret it.<br> It was a bad decision,<br> but at least it was a choice.<br> I mean, it was a real choice.<br> This way, I think, is,<br> I don't know, crazy.<br> It doesn't really work.<br> If I ever want to write<br> something worthwhile, I have to,<br> you know, get rid of my<br> illusions, and then I'd be<br> happier in the past,<br> as where I want a home.<br> So...<br> Goodbye, Gil?<br> Goodbye.<br> Pender, I read your rewrite,<br> and you're nicely on the right track.<br> You understood me clearly.<br> If the rest of the book<br> reads as well when you're done,<br> - you'll have something of value.<br> - That is the best news!<br> I really did listen to you,<br> so I'm happy to hear that it<br> You know, it seems like I'm<br> moving forward.<br> I mean, it just means<br> the world to me that you<br> - Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...<br> - He read it?<br> ...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.<br> but he did have one plot suggestion.<br> What's the suggestion?<br> Well, he doesn't quite believe<br> that the protagonist<br> doesn't see that his fiance is<br> having an affair right before his eyes.<br> - With?<br> - The other character. The pedantic one.<br> That's called denial.<br> Thank you.<br> You're crazy!<br> Paul and I?<br> Where did you get such an insane notion?<br> Where? From Ernest Hemingway.<br> He figured it out, and, guess what,<br> it makes perfect sense.<br> Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.<br> - No. No!<br> - There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,<br> or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,<br> or Salvador Dal!<br> Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!<br> No, no. The past is not dead.<br> Actually, it's not even past.<br> You know who said that?<br> Faulkner. And he was right.<br> And I met him, too.<br> I ran into him at a dinner party.<br> - You're a raving lunatic!<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - No. I'm too trusting.<br> I'm jealous,<br> and I'm trusting.<br> It's cognitive dissonance.<br> - Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.<br> - Gil. Gil.<br> Inez, you can fool me,<br> but you cannot fool Hemingway.<br> - I know.<br> - Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.<br> OK. Yes! I did.<br> I was with Paul for a few nights,<br> because he's romantic,<br> and he speaks French,<br> and you were always working, and maybe it's<br> the mystique of this corny city, but...<br> get over it, Gil.<br> You just put this in perspective<br> when we get home.<br> I'm not...I'm not going back.<br> - I'm sorry. What?<br> - I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,<br> you know, your romantic fling;<br> Paris is Paris.<br> Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...<br> I don't think we're right for each other.<br> What?<br> What are you saying?<br> What are you even talking about?<br> - You ready to go swimming?<br> - Hi!<br> We're breaking up.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.<br> - I knew it. I told you.<br> - What's going on?<br> No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but<br> just because we're...<br> If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.<br> But for the time being, yes.<br> W...W...With who?...<br> With who, Gil?<br> - No one, I...<br> - One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?<br> I mean, Mom's right about you.<br> You have this part missing.<br> Yeah, I said that first.<br> Anyone whose protagonist<br> makes a living<br> selling old cap pistols<br> and Joan Crawford cutout books...<br> - Honestly...<br> - Look, I'm not trying to be<br> a martyr, but I think<br> you'll be better off without me.<br> - I really do.<br> - But we would!<br> - I can't believe you're moving.<br> - Go ahead. Go ahead!<br> Walk the streets. Gush over the<br> Parisian light and the rooftops.<br> Goodbye, Inez.<br> - Say hi to Trotsky.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Unbelievable!<br> - You know, I had...<br> a private detective follow him.<br> I knew he was up to no good.<br> - You did?<br> - You bet I did.<br> He saw him get into a car<br> at midnight every night,<br> and he followed him very closely.<br> - And what happened?<br> - I don't know.<br> The detective agency says<br> the detective is missing.<br> qui dois-je l'honneur?<br> (To whom do I owe the honor?)<br> Je...Je suis perdu.<br> (I...I'm lost.)<br> J'ai detourne la mauvaise endroit.<br> (I made a wrong turn.)<br> Gardes! Gardes!<br> (Guards! Guards!)<br> Lui coupe la tte!<br> (Off with his head!)<br> Lui coupe la tte!<br> (Off with his head!)<br> - Hey! Hi!<br> - Hey!<br> Wow! What...<br> Good to see you.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I'm returning from dinner with friends.<br> - Oh. OK.<br> - I live here.<br> And you? What are you doing here?<br> I was just out for a walk.<br> Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.<br> I'm moving to Paris.<br> - Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah. You think so?<br> - Yeah.<br> You know, I thought about<br> you the other day.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah, because<br> my boss got a whole<br> new album of Cole Porter songs.<br> That made you think about me?<br> I like to be thought of that way.<br> You're on your way home right now?<br> Yes.<br> Can I walk with you,<br> or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?<br> Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.<br> No, but that's OK.<br> I don't mind getting wet.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.<br> I feel that's what<br> I'm always saying.<br> I couldn't agree more with you.<br> Yes, it is more beautiful.<br> By the way, my name is Gabrielle.<br> - Gil.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> That's a pretty name.<br>
