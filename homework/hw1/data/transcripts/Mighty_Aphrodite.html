                        Woe unto man.<br> Brave Achilles,<br> slain in trial by blood...<br> for prize,<br> the bride of Menelaus.<br> And father of Antigone,<br> ruler of Thebes,<br> self-rendered sightless<br> by lust for expiation.<br> Lost victim<br> of bewildered desire.<br> Nor has Jason's wife<br> fared better.<br> Giving life only to reclaim it<br> in vengeful fury.<br> For to understand<br> the ways of the heart...<br> is to grasp as clearly the malice<br> or ineptitude of the gods,<br> who, in their vain and clumsy labors<br> to create a flawless surrogate,<br> have left mankind<br> but dazed and incomplete.<br> Take, for instance,<br> the case of Lenny Weinrib,<br> a tale as Greek and timeless<br> as fate itself.<br> - Lenny, let's have a baby.<br> - Hey!<br> A baby? Why? Because she's pregnant,<br> you want to have a baby?<br> - No. It's a great idea.<br> - You could raise your own middleweight.<br> - I don't want a middleweight.<br> - Flyweight.<br> - No, it'd be fun.<br> - Have you ever had children?<br> - No, I've never had children.<br> - Why not?<br> What do you mean, "why not?" 'Cause my<br> first wife didn't want to have a child.<br> - Then I never remarried really, so--<br> - Oh, that's great.<br> - What am I, chopped liver?<br> - Until now.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I never-- You didn't let me finish.<br> - No, you'd forgotten.<br> - Now you've changed your mind.<br> You didn't want to have a child.<br> - You should have kids.<br> - It's like stereo. Give him a break.<br> - You don't want a kid?<br> - Oh, we--<br> When we first met, she didn't like<br> the beach; she hated the Hamptons;<br> she didn't want to have kids;<br> she loved the Upper East Side,<br> she didn't want to move.<br> Now suddenly she's making noise about<br> having a kid and moving to Tribeca.<br> - Only if the gallery moves downtown.<br> - Well, being pregnant is great.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I love it. You get treated<br> like the Queen of England.<br> - Sure.<br> - You say that like it's a good thing.<br> - Well, I like the pampering.<br> - She does like it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah, it's fantastic.<br> I can't give up the time<br> right now.<br> There are too many exciting things<br> happening in my business.<br> - So let me ask you a question.<br> - What?<br> How do you plan to swing it without<br> being pregnant? I'm curious.<br> - Good question. Very good question.<br> - No, it's easy.<br> - We'll adopt. Oh, well.<br> - Mmm.<br> - Not me. I don't want to adopt.<br> - There you go.<br> - Why not? That's a good idea.<br> - No. No.<br> - You must be nuts. With, with my genes?<br> - Yeah?<br> - To adopt? I have award-winning genes.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - I want to pass them on.<br> - No, that's crazy. No, the--<br> It's for the same reason<br> we don't lease a car, okay?<br> - 'Cause it's pride of ownership.<br> - Okay.<br> - And I don't want to adopt a child.<br> - No. Look, I'm sorry, Lenny.<br> It's crazy 'cause the world<br> is full of needy kids.<br> - You know, she's right.<br> - That's true.<br> - I know, but that-- You know, but I--<br> - No, I mean it.<br> Why overpopulate the world when there<br> are thousands of parent-less kids?<br> Just because you don't want<br> to get morning sickness, right?<br> - No, it's not true.<br> - That's why you want to adopt a kid.<br> I just can't afford<br> to give up a year just now.<br> Forget it. Subject is closed.<br> I don't wanna--<br> I'd be afraid that<br> I might get a bad seed.<br> - Oh, you're paranoid.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> That's right! What-- You read that<br> in the tabloids all the time.<br> - No. A bad seed.<br> - That's right.<br> Yeah, we adopt some sweet little boy,<br> and then he turns 13,<br> we'd go to sleep at night,<br> he'd split our head open with an axe.<br> Listen, why'd you have to<br> go and tell him that? You know<br> Lenny's got a vivid imagination.<br> - It's a common occurrence.<br> - I read the same paper.<br> What do you want me to tell you?<br> Anyway, what do you mean "he"?<br> Why can't we adopt a girl?<br> - We're not adopting anything.<br> I want no sex.<br> - A little girl.<br> Let the guy have a short stop<br> or a point guard, will ya?<br> Can we get a check? Can we--<br> Can we please get out of here?<br> I'll take the check.<br> I'm paying tonight.<br> - Yes.<br> - You? I'm stunned.<br> You pay, you break your record.<br> You-- One more and you break<br> DiMaggio's record-- 56 straight.<br> That's not true.<br> Now, be nice.<br> Laius, proud father, speak.<br> I, with joy,<br> did have a son...<br> so fair, so clearheaded<br> and brave,<br> that I a thousand pleasures<br> did derive from his presence.<br> So what happens?<br> One day he kills me.<br> And don't you think,<br> he runs off and marries my wife.<br> Poor Oedipus, king of Thebes.<br> My son, my son<br> did slay unwittingly...<br> my noble husband...<br> and did, without realizing,<br> hasten with me,<br> his loving mother,<br> to lustful bed.<br> And a whole profession<br> was born...<br> charging sometimes<br> and a 50-minute hour<br> at that.<br> And why a child now, out of left field?<br> One hopes it's not to fill<br> some growing void in their marriage.<br> Leave her be.<br> A woman's urge to motherhood<br> is old as the earth.<br> Children grow up;<br> they move out.<br> Sometimes to ridiculous places<br> like Cincinnati...<br> or Boise, Idaho.<br> Then you never see them again.<br> You'd think once in a while<br> they'd pick up a phone.<br> But is there a growing void<br> in the Weinrib's marriage?<br> We didn't say there was.<br> We're all just speculating<br> on possible motives.<br> Children are serious stuff.<br> Look, here's a man<br> who killed his father...<br> and slept with his mother.<br> I hate to tell you what they<br> call my son in Harlem.<br> Hello.<br> - There's a baby we can adopt.<br> - Are you serious?<br> I spoke to Carolyn Hester<br> and she's found an infant for us.<br> - But we have to act quickly.<br> - I don't want a kid.<br> Well, Lenny, you know<br> how hard it is.<br> And look, the baby's<br> one day old, totally healthy.<br> Unwed mother, no diseases.<br> And it's a boy.<br> You wanted a boy.<br> Amanda, I can't get<br> into this with you now.<br> This is not the place<br> to have this discussion.<br> I told Carolyn to be on the lookout.<br> She's experienced with adoptions.<br> She knows what she's doing.<br> It's a boy, healthy, born this morning.<br> No strings,<br> if we act quickly.<br> Le-- Look, I-- I gotta<br> put my foot down.<br> I-I-- If you want to<br> discuss this another time, we can.<br> But if you gotta have a fast answer,<br> it's definitely "no."<br> - Hi! Hi.<br> - You got his head?<br> - He's adorable.<br> - Yes. Oh, God.<br> This is great. This kid is never<br> going to be a fighter, you know.<br> I gotta run out and get some weights<br> because he's really light as a feather.<br> - Yeah, perhaps I should have him back.<br> - Hi.<br> Yeah. Maybe you better<br> hold him 'cause he's crying.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - He's crying.<br> - Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.<br> - That's a good boy.<br> - That's so great.<br> If there's any greatness in my hands,<br> let it pass into your body.<br> - Get a grip on yourself.<br> - This kid is gonna be a great kid!<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - He's fabulous!<br> - You're okay now.<br> - What do you wanna call him?<br> - Oh, this is unbelievable. Yeah.<br> - Call him?<br> - Oh, wh-- what about Eric?<br> - Eric? The kid's not a Viking.<br> I wanna call him, name him,<br> you know, for one of my heroes.<br> - Like what?<br> - I don't know.

What--<br> What about Phineas?<br> Do you like Phineas?<br> Phineas?<br> Are you joking?<br> Phineas is the guy who<br> forecloses on the mortgage.<br> I don't want to call this kid<br> Phineas. He's adorable.<br> - That's so great.<br> What-- What, uh-- Let me think.<br> - Well.<br> - What about Django?<br> - Django?<br> Django, yeah. After Django Reinhardt,<br> the great guitar player.<br> - Django Weinrib?<br> - That's the curse of the Weinrib name.<br> - It doesn't go with anything.<br> Nothing goes with Weinrib.<br> - Well, okay, okay.<br> What about something simple<br> like, you know, Ben?<br> - You want to call him Ben Weinrib?<br> - Yeah.<br> What, he's gonna be<br> a-a-a gin rummy champion?<br> - I mean, you know.<br> - Yeah, well, you want to deny<br> your heritage? Huh?<br> Well, you know, I-I just want<br> the kid to have a great name.<br> - Yeah.<br> - What about Sugar Ray Weinrib?<br> Holden,<br> after Holden Caulfield.<br> You see, Holden is one of those things<br> that works if we use your maiden name.<br> - If it's Holden Sloane,<br> but not Holden Weinrib.<br> - Yeah.<br> The kid is so cute!<br> I can't believe he's--<br> What about Cole?<br> - Cole?<br> - Cole Weinrib. Harpo Weinrib.<br> - Harpo? No.<br> - How about Earl the Pearl Weinrib?<br> - That would be so perfect.<br> - Oh, God! No.<br> - Okay, what-- what about Shane?<br> You like the name Shane?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Shane's pretty.<br> - Shane would be okay.<br> On the other hand, you wouldn't want<br> a Supreme Court Justice called Shane.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> I got it. I got it.<br> Brilliant.<br> This is so brilliant.<br> - Got it? Ready? Are you ready?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Thelonius Weinrib.<br> - Max! What about Max?<br> - Max?<br> - Yeah, Max.<br> Max.<br> Oh, look how cute he is.<br> - I wanna hold him. Max is okay.<br> - He's so sweet. He's smiling.<br> - Dr. Max Weinrib. I like the name Max.<br> - Yeah, Max is good.<br> - It's simple.<br> - How about Senator Max Weinrib?<br> - Little tongue.<br> - Rabbi Max-- Rabbi Max Weinrib?<br> No. Maybe we should<br> rethink Max for a minute.<br> - Oh, he's so great.<br> - He's happy. I think he likes us.<br> - He looks like you.<br> - He looks like me?<br> Yeah.<br> He looks like Broderick<br> Crawford a little bit.<br> - He's so smart.<br> - Yeah.<br> He picks up on everything.<br> He's got a great personality.<br> You know, you wake him up,<br> he's always smiling and upbeat.<br> - Like me.<br> - You were like that<br> when you were a baby.<br> - Yeah, he's so verbal.<br> - Well, he's around a writer...<br> and an art expert, right?<br> Listen, when are you going<br> to move the gallery downtown?<br> Yeah, Mother, we don't want to get<br> into that discussion 'cause, you know,<br> I think we should move and Lenny<br> is a devoted Upper East-sider.<br> Or shall I say is opposed<br> to change in any form?<br> - I don't know.<br> - It's unbelievable.<br> The kid is unbelievable.

I saw his test scores<br> and they're wonderful.<br> - They are. Yeah.<br> - I know. And he's got<br> a great sense of humor.<br> - He's a sweet kid.<br> He's a really sweet kid.<br> - He's got a great personality.<br> Wonderful. Well, I wanted to talk<br> to you about a special program...<br> that we have<br> for bright students.<br> - Really? And he qualifies?<br> - Oh, yes. Absolutely.<br> - Sorry. Excuse me.<br> - Certainly.<br> - Because-- when you hear his syntax,<br> - Hello? Oh, hi.<br> - it's amazing.<br> - Verbal skills are telling.<br> - His vocabulary is good,<br> but his syntax is--<br> - Oh, great.<br> - He speaks like a grown-up.<br> - Sorry. Lenny?<br> - What we can do is--<br> - Sorry. Excuse me.<br> - Oh, certainly.<br> Can we meet the Dorians tonight<br> for dinner at Le Cirque?<br> The Dorians?

I'm going with you.<br> - Yeah?<br> But we got tickets to a show.<br> It's a shame.<br> This time try and join in and don't<br> sit there like some zombie all night.<br> Hey, last time I joined in,<br> you got angry with me.<br> Yeah, 'cause we were discussing<br> the l.M. Pei Museum, not Muhammad Ali.<br> Well, my mind wandered.<br> I can't keep on those topics.<br> I just don't want to be the motor power<br> of the Bender Gallery forever.<br> I want the<br> Amanda Sloane Gallery.<br> Not Amanda Weinrib,<br> 'cause there's a euphony problem.<br> Three, four, run.<br> Three, four, and break the ball.<br> - Play 88!<br> - I hope they don't play like this.<br> - 88! Ten-hut!<br> What's the matter?<br> You seem down.<br> - No, I'm fine.<br> - You're fine?<br> Something's on your mind,<br> Lenny.<br> Listen, last night I was<br> at one of those dinner parties again.<br> Amanda-- You know,<br> last week she took me to,<br> to Le Cirque with the Dorians.<br> And then last night it was<br> with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.<br> And then after that,<br> we were driving home...<br> and I don't know<br> what to say.<br> It was Saturday night, you know, and we<br> stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.<br> I looked out the window<br> and I see some guy and this pretty girl.<br> And, you know,<br> they're walking home and, you know,<br> the guy's carrying<br> the Sunday papers.<br> It looked like they were<br> having so much fun, you know.<br> And, you know--<br> I don't know, I--<br> I remember how great it<br> used to be with me and Amanda...<br> in our first apartment,<br> you know, how romantic it was.<br> You know, in those days it was<br> just a kick shopping together...<br> or, you know, just walking<br> the New York streets, you know.<br> Then when Max came,<br> everything was so great, you know.<br> We had such terrific times.<br> I don't know, it's been so long<br> since there's been, you know,<br> the old passion between us.<br> I don't know, but it was the first time<br> I had any of those thoughts.<br> And, you know,<br> they made me feel nervous.<br> You weren't too pleasant<br> this evening.<br> Why, 'cause I said no about going<br> to your boss Jerry Bender's house...<br> - in the Hamptons?<br> - I'll be fine.<br> I don't like the Hamptons. You know,<br> you used to hate the beach yourself.<br> Yeah, not the way he lives.<br> It's private and beautiful.<br> What are you getting<br> so angry about?<br> - 'Cause you won't come.<br> - Last time we went, I got a tick.<br> - A tick? Oh, wow. Big deal.<br> - For you, it wasn't a big deal.<br> - But I took my pants off, I had<br> a black thing living in my leg.<br> - Everyone will be there.<br> For the potential contacts,<br> I can put up with a few ticks.<br> I don't-- What contacts?<br> You know, it's like you're<br> an international spy.<br> - You got contacts all over town.<br> - I plan to have my own gallery,<br> and soon.<br> You've changed unbelievably<br> over the years.<br> - Oh, yeah? You know what, Lenny?<br> - You used to hate that.<br> - People grow. They grow. Some people.<br> - It's not growth.<br> You used to hate the beach.<br> And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.<br> What?<br> - This guy stares at you.<br> - Oh, no. That's nuts.<br> - That's seriously crazy.<br> - He mentally undresses you.<br> - That's his normal look.<br> - It's not his normal look.<br> - If he looked at me that way<br> I'd hit him with a brick.<br> - Okay. Okay, let's--<br> - Or kiss him on the lips, maybe.<br> - Let's drop this. Please?<br> Well, what do you mean,<br> you couldn't find it?<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> You know, it's dark in here...<br> and I-- you know,<br> we haven't done it in a while.<br> - And then you got so angry at me.<br> - I wasn't angry.<br> I wasn't angry. You were fumbling<br> and I was getting out of the mood.<br> Sorry, I couldn't find it. This--<br> We haven't been doing it in a while.<br> - Okay, let's not get into<br> a whole discussion here.<br> - I lost my sense of direction.<br> I'm tired.<br> Every marriage goes through<br> valleys and peaks.<br> - This is like a valley.<br> - I don't mind going through a valley.<br> - But I don't want to sink<br> beneath sea level here.<br> - Lenny, why rock the boat?<br> You got a bright, beautiful wife.<br> You got a kid that you're crazy for.<br> I'm not gonna rock the boat.<br> Did I tell you about Max?<br> They want to put him in a special class<br> because he's got a high IQ.<br> Yeah, well, two bright parents.<br> I mean, what do you expect?<br> Yeah, whoever they are.<br> I mean, I still don't know.<br> It's like raising thoroughbreds.<br> This kid must come<br> from good stock.<br> He's good-looking; he's got a high IQ;<br> he's got a great personality.<br> And he's amusing.<br> This is not my doing.<br> Amanda did the whole adoption.<br> I just resisted.<br> I complained, like a jerk.<br> I mean, a good father, a dynamite mother<br> produces a kid like Max.<br> I think the father's dead,<br> you know.<br> - The mother?<br> Don't go any further!<br> I know what you're thinking,<br> Lenny, and forget it.<br> How can I forget it?<br> The thought's been put into my head.<br> Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts<br> are better left unthunk.<br> I'll bet this kid<br> has a dynamite mother.<br> What makes you think he didn't<br> inherit everything from his father?<br> Everything? That's very unlikely.<br> But I'm gonna find out.<br> Let sleeping dogs lie.<br> - I'll bet she's great.<br> - Curiosity. That's what kills us.<br> Not muggers or all that bullshit<br> about the ozone layer.<br> It's our own hearts and minds.<br> - I'm gonna find out.<br> - Please, Lenny, don't be a schmuck.<br> I remember the adoption vaguely because<br> I'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.<br> But it was not that long ago<br> that we-- that we did it.<br> I recall trying to<br> expedite matters for her.<br> I somehow think it was<br> a single parent with no father.<br> Right. Exactly. So-So how--<br> Is it possible for me to get the name--<br> I'd like the name<br> of the mother, if I could.<br> That remains forever<br> in our files.<br> Even if I have it, I can't give it<br> to you. May I ask why you want to know?<br> Yes, 'cause I-I--<br> I'm curious about it...<br> and I'm trying to get<br> all the information that I can.<br> - So, so--<br> - I'm sorry. That's all<br> I can help you with.<br> There's no possibility<br> of, uh--<br> - No, those are the rules.<br> - I don't understand.<br> I'm the father of the child.<br> - I can't find out who--<br> - They're very firm. It's never done.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - How is the little boy doing?<br> - Good. He's great. He's fabulous.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes.<br> - Say hello to Amanda.<br> - There's no possibility that I could--<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - There's--<br> - Really sorry. No way.<br> - Okay, thank you. Thank you.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> What are you doing, Weinrib?<br> Don't confuse me!<br> She's coming back in a minute.<br> - You are breaking the law.<br> - Breaking the law?<br> There's a higher law.<br> I can find out<br> who my son's mother is.<br> The judge won't see it<br> that way.<br> Keep a lookout for me,<br> will you, for Christ's sake?<br> - Me? I'm the leader of the Chorus.<br> - So what? Look out.<br> Get your friend Bud<br> to help you.<br> Bud can't help me. You know,<br> Ellie and Amanda are friendly.<br> - Bud can't keep a secret.<br> - Why is it a secret?<br> Why can't Amanda know?<br> What kind of argument am I<br> getting into with you? Amanda--<br> 'Cause she wouldn't understand.<br> Oh, you're guilty because you<br> already have exaggerated notions...<br> about your son's mother.<br> It's understandable because things<br> are not going smoothly with Amanda.<br> That's why you will always<br> be a chorus member.<br> Because you don't do anything.<br> I act.<br> I take action.<br> I make things happen.<br> Well, hurry the hell up.<br> I hear footsteps.<br> I-I forgot my-- I dropped<br> my manila envelope. I didn't realize it.<br> - Oh.<br> - It has an important interview in it.<br> With-- With Roberto Duran.<br> You won't believe this,<br> but he's heading for Pennsylvania.<br> Of all the human weaknesses,<br> - obsession is the most dangerous.<br> - And the silliest.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I'm looking for a former tenant here,<br> - a-a-a Leslie Wright.<br> - Who are you?<br> I'm a friend of hers, and I believe<br> she lived here at one time--<br> a Leslie Wright?<br> Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember<br> the girl who used to live here.<br> - You remember.<br> The pretty one upstairs.<br> - Yeah, yeah, right.<br> She was only here for a while.<br> Who are you?<br> Uh, I'm just an old friend of hers<br> and I was trying to track her down.<br> Do you know-- Do you know<br> where I could find her?<br> Leslie Wailes was her name,<br> not Leslie Wright. Leslie Wailes.<br> - Leslie Wailes?<br> - Wailes.<br> - She moved to New York.<br> - You sure? 'Cause I have Leslie Wright.<br> Leslie-- Leslie--<br> Did she get married or--<br> I don't know.<br> You have no other information?<br> You don't know where I could<br> find her or anything?<br> No. She was only here<br> for a little while. I told you.<br> Look, let me give you<br> my phone number.<br> If anything turns up,<br> I would love to locate her.<br> - Here. Give me that. I'll take that.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Yeah. Okay.<br> - You're welcome.<br> You have a phone call. Mr. Lamont.<br> Says he's from Philadelphia.<br> - Oh.<br> - You gave him your number?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Is this Lenny Weinrib?<br> - Go ahead, sir.<br> - Hello.<br> Yeah, this is Bill Lamont.<br> Um, that woman you were looking for--<br> We asked another guy who said<br> her name was Leslie St. James.<br> Said she moved to New York City,<br> talked about becoming an actress.<br> - Leslie St. James?<br> - Yes, sir. Yeah.<br> He remembered her quite well.<br> Leslie St. James is the name she took.<br> There was a Leslie St. James who was<br> a member of the Screen Extras Guild.<br> - So that's that.<br> - So what are you telling me?<br> That-- That she was a movie<br> extra or stage extra?<br> Yeah.<br> That's all I have.<br> So-- And there's an address,<br> but, uh, you know,<br> this book's<br> a few years old. So.<br> I'm looking for a--<br> it's-- she--<br> A Leslie St. James<br> or maybe it's a Leslie Wailes.<br> - I don't know,<br> but I think she lived here.<br> - Oh, yeah, sure. I remember.<br> She was a tall girl.<br> She changed her name to Linda Ash.<br> Linda Ash?<br> Yeah, it was a fake name.<br> She-- She did sex movies.<br> - Sex movies?<br> - Yeah, you know, like, uh, Deep Throat.<br> Skin flicks.<br> Tall, blonde, hot.<br> - Very hot.<br> - Really? Good-looking?<br> Oh, great looking.<br> Tremendous body.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - Hey, Lenny, how are ya?<br> - Good. Can I talk to you a minute?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I need a favor.<br> - You got it. What?<br> You got friends in the, uh,<br> the adult film business, right?<br> My nephew knows them all.<br> Why?<br> I'm trying to locate<br> an actress named Linda Ash.<br> - You know which movies she did?<br> - No.<br> I was in the video store<br> trying to get a video,<br> but, you know, I get embarrassed<br> because my neighbor saw me there.<br> - And, you know--<br> - I hear ya.<br> - Well, let me get back to you<br> on that one. All right?<br> - Yeah.<br> You know, I don't know<br> why we have to do this.<br> I-I don't want to spend<br> the whole weekend at Jerry Bender's.<br> Oh, Lenny, please.<br> We've been through this.<br> There are lots<br> of important clients there.<br> I-- You know,<br> so what is this?<br> Meanwhile this guy's going to<br> stare at you the whole weekend<br> and mentally undress you.<br> He is not. He's not.<br> God, your paranoia is rivaled<br> in history only by Joseph Stalin.<br> I'm really glad you<br> could make it out this weekend, Amanda.<br> There's some people around here I think<br> it's very important you should meet.<br> Oh, thanks, Jerry.<br> I really appreciate it. I really do.<br> - God, I love your sailboat.<br> - Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Sorry the waves were so choppy, Lenny.<br> Oh, it's no problem. I don't mind<br> throwing up into the wind, you know.<br> You know, we could see<br> that house next door at 3:00.<br> By the way, it's a great buy.<br> Is it possible that I could<br> just make one quick phone call?<br> - Yeah. Ken!<br> - Yes, Jerry.<br> Oh, sorry, Ken.<br> Can you show Lenny the private phone?<br> Sure. Come on, Lenny.<br> It's right over here.<br> The house sounds exciting.<br> What are they asking again?<br> Amanda, listen. Why don't you,<br> uh, spend the night here tonight.<br> - What do you say?<br> Are you free tonight?<br> - Uh--<br> We could go for a sail.<br> You can't believe what the stars<br> look like lying on the back of a boat.<br> - Yeah. No, I'd love to.<br> I really would love to.<br> - Well, then, do it.<br> But I-- No, he<br> has to get back.<br> Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hmm.<br> Hmm.<br> I got the skinny<br> on Linda Ash.<br> She's been in a few films.<br> She's no star or nothin'.<br> That's why you<br> never heard of her.<br> She works under<br> the stage name "Judy Cum."<br> Mostly, she's a hooker.<br> Uh, I got her number.<br> Judy Cum?<br> Oh, you never should<br> have looked for her.<br> Now I see big trouble.<br> Oh, for God's sake.<br> You know, you're such a Cassandra.<br> I'm not such a Cassandra.<br> I am Cassandra.<br> - That's who I am.<br> - I gotta check this thing out.<br> You'll be sorry.<br> I'm telling you, quit now.<br> Oh, and don't let Amanda talk you<br> into buying the house next door.<br> - This place?<br> - Yes! I see big problems<br> with beach erosion...<br> and a heavy mortgage.<br> Well, I love that property.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - We're right near everybody.<br> Doesn't mean we have to see them<br> all the time, but we have the option.<br> You-- You're not afraid<br> of beach erosion, right?<br> Beach erosion? Oh, come on, now.<br> You're such a Cassandra.<br> You gonna take a shower?<br> Yeah. Yeah, can you, uh,<br> fix something for dinner?<br> Yeah, I'll make dinner.<br> I'll make the spaghetti, okay?<br> There's some sauce<br> in the fridge.<br> Hello, is this Linda?<br> Linda, um, this is Lenny.<br> Uh, I-- I got your number<br> from Charlie Biggs.<br> And I wonder if, uh,<br> it would be possible...<br> that you would have some time<br> tomorrow afternoon.<br> - You shouldn't do this.<br> - Would you please stop it?<br> - You're gonna cheat on Amanda?<br> - I'm not cheating.<br> -I just want to see what she looks like.<br> -You can get a disease.<br> - Aren't you scared of AIDS?<br> - I'm not gonna sleep with the girl.<br> I just want to see<br> what she looks like.<br> I want to get to know her<br> or something. It's just--<br> Uh, is it possible that we<br> could meet at a hotel?<br> You're gonna rent a hotel room<br> with a hooker and not sleep with her?<br> Leave me alone.<br> I want to talk to her.<br> How about the Plaza<br> on 59th Street? Is that--<br> What are you doing?<br> At least pick an out-of-the-way spot.<br> Oh, Christ.<br> Um, Linda, maybe<br> it'd be better if I--<br> What about your place?<br> Would that be a possibility?<br> - Uh-huh. Uh--<br> Hold on one second.<br> Okay.<br> Um, I'll be there.<br> And it's Lenny.<br> Uh, Lenny... Gildersleeve.<br> Okay.<br> I can't believe this.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Hi. Are you my 3:00?<br> - Linda Ash?<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> - I'm Lenny.<br> - Hello, Lenny. Come on in.<br> - Uh, you're-- you're Linda Ash, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - 'Cause we spoke on the phone?<br> - Yeah.<br> Are you okay?<br> You look all white.<br> - I'm okay.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Do you want something to drink?<br> - Maybe-- Do you have a little<br> Perrier or something?<br> - What?<br> - Little-- Just a little tap water?<br> - Oh, sure. I have that.<br> - You're definitely Linda Ash?<br> - Yeah.<br> What's the matter?<br> Are you a stroke victim or something?<br> I told you three times.<br> I'm Linda Ash.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, you have a,<br> a beautiful apartment.<br> - Oh, thank you. I did it myself.<br> - Oh.<br> Oh, let me show you<br> something I just got.<br> - That. Isn't it a pisser?<br> - Ohh!<br> Oh, yes, it's--<br> it's magnificent.<br> Oh. Well, yeah.<br> I got a great sense of humor.<br> That's something you're going<br> to find out about me-- I'm funny<br> and I can take a joke.<br> - A lot of people can't take a joke.<br> - Oh, no, I can.<br> - They say that about me too.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - That I have a good sense of humor.<br> - Oh, good!<br> Then you'll like this. Look,<br> I just got this. Somebody gave it to me.<br> As the main spring goes back and forth,<br> the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.<br> - It's a genuine antique<br> and it keeps perfect time.<br> - Oh, my goodness.<br> It's a disgusting--<br> Ohh.<br> - Lenny?<br> The water today is a little bit brown.<br> Would you like some Sprite instead?<br> - I'm feeling a little dizzy. I--<br> - Oh, no!<br> - Come sit down.<br> - No, no. I don't know why.<br> Usually, you know,<br> I'm just the picture of health.<br> - Yeah? You work out?<br> - Not-- Not religiously.<br> Oh, I'm not religious either.<br> Mostly, my folks were Episcopalian.<br> - Oh, are they? So--<br> - So.<br> So what do you do, Lenny?<br> Oh, no. Wait. Let me guess.<br> I have a great knack for guessing<br> what people do for a living.<br> - Um--<br> - Um, uh-- I'll tell you the truth.<br> - Rug salesman!<br> - You're close.<br> I'm-- I'm a sportswriter.<br> Because--<br> - Shit. I wasn't even in the ballpark.<br> - Well, it was not--<br> Wait. Ballpark. Sportswriter.<br> Get it?<br> - I get it.<br> I did it with a wrestler once.<br> A huge, hairy guy.<br> You'd figure he'd be hung like a horse,<br> but there was very little there.<br> Look, could I-- could I<br> just get a little water?<br> - I don't care if it's brown.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I don't mind rust.<br> I'm just feeling a little--<br> T-Tell me, Linda.<br> Uh, uh, tell me<br> about yourself, Linda.<br> Well, what do you--<br> what do you want to know?<br> Anything.<br> I just want to know about you.<br> - Well, basically, Lenny,<br> - Yes?<br> - I'm an actress.<br> - Oh, that's wonderful.<br> I like drama. I study.<br> Yes? Uh, where--<br> where's that?<br> Paul Delucca.<br> Have you ever heard of him?<br> - Paul Delucca? No.<br> But then, I wouldn't.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, he's really well-known.<br> He's a genius.<br> - I'm sure. I'm sure.<br> He says he thinks I'm gonna<br> make it big.<br> - Mmm.<br> - Um, I know you will.<br> - Yeah. Maybe you've seen<br> some of my movies.<br> - That's possible.<br> Did you ever see<br> The Enchanted Pussy?<br> Not yet, but I-I--<br> It's on my list of must-see.<br> Oh, they're videotapes,<br> so you can rent it.<br> But my real ambition is<br> to be on Broadway in a musical.<br> - I sing.<br> - Do you?<br> - Excuse me.<br> Hello? Busy. Some of them<br> are called John, all right?<br> - Was that-- Was that your husband?<br> - Ha-ha. Very funny.<br> No, but I mean, you have no husband,<br> no family, no children...<br> or anything like that?<br> 'Cause some do.<br> You have a funny look on your face.<br> - Um.<br> - Did I say the wrong thing?<br> - No. Not really.<br> - I-- I said--<br> No. No, listen.<br> - What are you in the mood for, Len?<br> - Me? I-I, well,<br> I would like to--<br> You know, we can chat for a while.<br> I thought I'd get into it<br> slowly and, you know--<br> You're married, aren't you?<br> - How can you tell that?<br> - 'Cause you got that look.<br> That look?<br> Wh-What look is that?<br> That look like it's been a long time<br> since you've had a great blow job.<br> Oh, that look.<br> I-- I can understand.<br> - Wh-Where are you from?<br> - Mm, around.<br> What are you so interested<br> in me for?<br> - That's my fingers.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - Here.<br> - What--<br> Pull, pull!<br> Pull the strings.<br> - Pull these strings?<br> - Yeah, pull all the strings.<br> See? See what happens?<br> - I'm not so mechanical as I was.<br> - Oh, it's easy. Here. Pull.<br> - Ahh! See, it opens!<br> - Ohh!<br> That's amazing.<br> Science is-- is--<br> - Yeah.<br> - You, you, you-- I-I--<br> Oh. Really. Well.<br> Uh, you're a very attractive woman,<br> a very beautiful young woman.<br> Oh, thank you, Lenny.<br> Well, you're cute too.<br> So, what do you say?<br> - You wanna go inside, take a shower?<br> - A shower?<br> -You can study me up close and personal.<br> -Oh! Oh.<br> No, see, I bathed already.<br> - You got lipstick on my fi--<br> - Mmm, you smell clean. Mmm.<br> - Thank you. Well--<br> As I say, I'm basically--<br> My ear.<br> - You're sensitive, huh?<br> - It's my weak spot, in my ear.<br> - Oh. Okay.<br> A little nibbling<br> makes me... go crazy.<br> Okay, Len.<br> Are you nervous?<br> I-- No. But yes, I am nervous,<br> to tell you the truth.<br> - You do look that way.<br> - I've never-- I-I've never<br> done this, actually.<br> - Oh, okay. That's all right.<br> I'll take it slow.<br> - This is-- I-I--<br> Oh. Okay. I--<br> Um, incidentally, Len,<br> I think I should tell you<br> ahead of time I-I get 200 dollars.<br> It's no problem.<br> No problem.<br> - Just a-- Just a show of good faith.<br> - Thanks, Lenny. Wow!<br> You're really sweet, Len.<br> Put it down<br> as a religious contribution.<br> No, but seriously, you want to know<br> why I liked you right from the start?<br> - Why?<br> - 'Cause I'm always attracted to losers.<br> Losers?<br> You think I'm a loser?<br> Yeah.<br> You got no confidence.<br> It's sweet.<br> I like that in a man.<br> I can't stand those johns who come here<br> and throw down a couple of hundred...<br> and whip out a big dick<br> and wave it all over the joint.<br> Oh, I-- I wouldn't do that<br> even if I wanted to because I'll just--<br> - Ah, shit!<br> Hello. Oh, hello,<br> Angela.<br> Oh! Oh, wow!<br> Ha-ha!<br> Oh, God, thank you<br> for thinking of me.<br> Yeah, that's great.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah, well, I'll see you at 10:00.<br> Bye.<br> I just got a small part<br> in an Angela Dawson movie.<br> I get to do it with her!<br> I don't understand you.<br> If you're-- If you're serious<br> about being a Broadway actress,<br> what are you wasting your time<br> with all this porn for?<br> What's it to you?<br> It's good experience.<br> How? Making it with a woman in front<br> of the camera is good experience?<br> That's gonna get you closer<br> to be a Broadway star?<br> - What are you getting all mad for?<br> - I'm not mad.<br> I just think it's crazy.<br> You're an attractive young woman.<br> You know, what are you--<br> You don't have to live like this, Linda.<br> - What are you, my pastor?<br> - This is crazy!<br> You take money from guys<br> and you perform all these acts.<br> You know, you could be--<br> Hey, I'm talking to you.<br> - You could have a family.<br> - Hey, let go of me!<br> - You could have a husband<br> and a child or something.<br> - All right. No. Hey!<br> Stop. Stop it now! Stop!<br> - Listen. I don't like possessive men.<br> - I'm not possessive.<br> You come in here, you don't<br> want to do anything with me.<br> You're telling me what to do.<br> - I want to talk.<br> - Do you want to do it or not?<br> - I want to talk.<br> I paid you, I want to talk.<br> - Oh, no. Okay.<br> - I bought the time.<br> - Then you get your money back.<br> - I'm giving it back. Refund.<br> - No, keep the money.<br> - Let's go. No.<br> - I bought the time!<br> - Hey, stop it. No, I'm giving<br> it back and you're leaving.<br> - Why can't I talk?<br> - Get out!<br> Daddy, why are you<br> staring at me like that?<br> Come here.<br> You know why I'm<br> staring at you?<br> I'm staring at you<br> 'cause I can't believe it.<br> Because you're so bright<br> and you're such a great kid.<br> Come on, Max.<br> Now it's time for bed.<br> Come on. Okay.<br> Time for beddums.<br> - Ready? The kid's getting heavy.<br> - He can walk, you know.<br> - Yeah. Okay. Can you walk?<br> Poor Weinrib! Turn back.<br> Don't meddle any further.<br> Accept the truth.<br> I see disaster.<br> I see catastrophe.<br> Worse, I see lawyers.<br> But wait, a messenger.<br> I come from the midtown area<br> where Lenny Weinrib,<br> tortured by passions<br> too overwhelming to regulate,<br> did indeed call<br> this little hustler on the phone...<br> in earnest attempt<br> to see her again.<br> At first he wrestled<br> with his drives,<br> trying to master a curiosity...<br> not slaked by this initial meeting,<br> but only whetted by it.<br> His thirst to know this woman more<br> did inexorably provoke him to call her.<br> Nervous and confused, at first<br> he only got her answering machine.<br> Then, at fifth try,<br> she picked up the phone herself.<br> Painful to relate that she<br> thought he was nuts and did<br> not want to meet him nohow.<br> "Stop bothering me, creep,"<br> was her cutting declaration.<br> Then she used the "F" word.<br> Agonized, he called again, offering<br> her abundant financial compensation...<br> just for a brief chat.<br> But she bade him get off her back<br> and slammed the phone down.<br> Finally, in doldrums mixed<br> with much anxiety,<br> he stood watch<br> outside her apartment...<br> and waited until such a time as he did<br> spot her heading for the laundromat.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - Okay, don't get upset or anything.<br> - I just thought we could have lunch.<br> - Why me?<br> - I'll pay for your time.<br> I just want to speak to you.<br> - All right!<br> What are you, some kind<br> of fucking pervert who--<br> Leave me alone. I'm not--<br> I'm not one of those psychopaths...<br> that kills prostitutes,<br> I promise you.<br> - Why would you ever say<br> something like that?<br> - I'm joking. I'm joking.<br> Listen, in my work, I have to keep<br> an eye out for strange individuals.<br> - Okay.<br> - I knew a girl that got killed.<br> All right. Hey,<br> I got you some flowers. Here.<br> I got you some flowers.<br> Let's have lunch. I'll pay for it.<br> I'll pay for your time.<br> I just wanna talk to you.<br> So then my mother married<br> my third father.<br> I mean, I don't know if she<br> married him, but he moved in.<br> We didn't get along.<br> He was a disgusting drunk.<br> What about your hereditary<br> father? Your actual, actual--<br> Oh, he was a drug pusher<br> and he was also a car thief.<br> He picked pockets and, you know,<br> he burgled and stuff.<br> - And he was an epileptic.<br> - Uh-huh. You haven't left<br> anything out, right?<br> - Mail fraud!<br> - Oh, mail fraud. Oh, okay, yeah.<br> - That's what they caught him on.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Hey, you got an appetite<br> like a lumberjack.<br> Oh. Well, thank you.<br> Oh, it's fine.<br> Eat all you want.<br> I'm very hungry, actually.<br> Um, so then I ran away when I was 14.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> And I went away with<br> this musician named Johnny.<br> And it was terrible because<br> we fought all the time, Lenny.<br> Finally,<br> he committed suicide.<br> And for years I thought it<br> was because of my cooking.<br> He always hated my clam sauce.<br> And so then I kicked around<br> from Chicago, Philadelphia, you know.<br> All over the place.<br> And I ended up here.<br> You never thought of<br> just getting a regular job?<br> Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.<br> No, I did things.<br> I waited on tables. I worked<br> in a massage parlor. I did phone sex.<br> Now and then I would, you know, turn a<br> few tricks in order to make some dough.<br> And one day my friend Susie calls me and<br> she asks me if I want to be in a film.<br> Something called Snatch Happy.<br> And I said, "Sure."<br> And I remember<br> I was very nervous...<br> because I'd never done it in front of<br> people with a camera before, you know.<br> And so there I am on the first day,<br> on the set.<br> And there's this guy<br> fucking me from behind, right?<br> And there's these two huge guys dressed<br> like cops in my mouth at the same time.<br> And I remember<br> thinking to myself,<br> "I like acting. I wanna study."<br> Yes, well.<br> It's a-- It's a--<br> That's one way<br> of getting into the profession.<br> Um, tell me about<br> your family a little bit.<br> What? I told you already.<br> You could write a book by now.<br> But, but were there<br> any unusual members?<br> - Very bright ones or brilliant<br> or talented or something.<br> - Mmm! Yes!<br> - I'm sorry. There was.<br> - Mmm.<br> My father's brother<br> was supposed to be a genius.<br> I never met him, but everybody<br> said he was brilliant.<br> - Really? What did he do?<br> - He was a serial rapist.<br> He spent his whole life in jail.<br> But if he had gone straight,<br> he might have been very good in math.<br> - Good in math. Well, that's--<br> - Yeah.<br> I think I got<br> my intelligence from him,<br> because everybody else in the family<br> is all slugs and lowlifes.<br> - I'm the only one with any ambition.<br> - Are you?<br> And you never-- never<br> had a drive to get married?<br> What for?<br> They're all assholes.<br> One of them used to<br> beat me up.<br> Another one used to fuck<br> my best friend when I wasn't looking.<br> - It was sickening.<br> - Really.<br> And-- And let me<br> ask you this.<br> At any point in your life<br> did you ever think, like,<br> "Maybe I'd like<br> to have a child"?<br> Um, I-l did have<br> a child once.<br> - Did you?<br> - Ah, it was a sad story.<br> I'll tell you some other time<br> when I know you better.<br> If I ever know you better.<br> Are you free this afternoon?<br> - Why?<br> - You have some free time<br> this afternoon?<br> - Are you finally in the mood, Lenny?<br> - No, no, no, no, no.<br> I wanna--<br> I have an assignment.<br> But I thought you might wanna come<br> with me, 'cause I think you'll enjoy it.<br> I'm gonna bet on a horse,<br> and if it wins you can keep the dough.<br> Here's one. "Eager Beaver."<br> I once did a film<br> called Beaver Patrol...<br> about these Boy Scouts who find<br> drunk Girl Scouts in the woods.<br> And they take them into a cabin<br> and they reach into their packs<br> and they pull out these dildos.<br> - And then--<br> - All right, all right. Okay, we'll--<br> Y-You're sure you want<br> to bet on Eager Beaver?<br> - 'Cause it's a 60-to-1.<br> - Oh, yeah. No, I know it's the one. No!<br> - But it's 60-to-1.<br> - It's a sign. I know it's gonna work.<br> All right, all right.<br> Famous last words.<br> - You know.<br> - I got a hunch.<br> - You got a hunch. Okay.<br> Sure, we'll bet on it.<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay. So if he wins,<br> how much do I make?<br> At 60-to-1?<br> Uh... you make, uh, $3,000.<br> Oh, my God! I could get that blue<br> chinchilla coat that I wanted!<br> - You could get anything you want.<br> - I could get a Jacuzzi.<br> - Except he's not gonna win.<br> - Oh, no, I know what I could do, Lenny!<br> - Oh, my God! This is great.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> All right. You know,<br> I hope-- I hope you're right.<br> There's a reason the horse is 60-to-1,<br> though. He's probably got polio.<br> Oh, no, no. No.<br> This is a sign.<br> - All right.<br> - My luck is gonna change.<br> - So is your real name Linda?<br> Is that your actual name?<br> - I use a lot of names.<br> My born name is Leslie, but I like<br> to use names that have nice meanings.<br> You know, like Mary,<br> for the Virgin Mary.<br> Or Angel or Linda,<br> which means "pretty" in Spanish.<br> - But my screen name's Judy Cum.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Well, lucky there's not a horse<br> with that name in the race...<br> - 'cause we'd bet on him.<br> - Oh, no, no, no.<br> I mean, my attorney friend<br> would take that under advisement.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - I got exclusive rights to that name.<br> All right, all right,<br> all right. Yeah.<br> So let me ask you<br> a question.<br> Are you ever frightened that when a guy<br> comes over your house and pays you...<br> that he's gonna maybe,<br> like tie you up and kill you?<br> Oh, no. I always<br> get paid in advance.<br> - Come on.<br> - Eager Beaver. He's paying.<br> - Paid in advance? That's--<br> Lenny.<br> - They're<br> coming down to the finish.<br> - Come on, Beaver!<br> - It's Autumn Daisy and Enmity.<br> - Come on! Catch up!<br> - Eager Beaver continues to drop back.<br> - Oh, shit! Oh, Beaver!<br> - Autumn Daisy and Enmity. It's close.<br> - Beaver! Come on, Beaver!<br> - Oh! Beaver!<br> - It's Autumn Daisy by a head.<br> - Shit! Last?<br> - Enmity finishing second...<br> - and Lower The Flag finishing third,<br> - Stupid horse got-- Damn it!<br> - followed by Marcy's Pride,<br> True Blue Crew, Classic Alert,<br> - I had it spent already!<br> - I know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya?<br> - and Eager Beaver was last.<br> You know, it's not so terrible.<br> I told you it was a long shot.<br> - I never have any luck. Never!<br> - All right.<br> I never won a fucking thing<br> in my entire life! Nothing! Never!<br> Will you stay calm?<br> You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.<br> If it's the money,<br> I'll lend you the money.<br> - I can help you.<br> - No, it's not the money, Lenny.<br> I don't care about the money.<br> I just wanted to win so badly.<br> What do you want to win for?<br> We're just out here having a good time.<br> - You gotta--<br> - 'Cause I wanted to impress you.<br> Impress me? What? You know,<br> you're not running in the race.<br> What-- You don't<br> have to impress me. I'm--<br> Yeah, but I wanted to show you<br> I could pick a winner.<br> Hey. Listen, my horse<br> didn't win either, you know.<br> Come on, you--<br> you do impress me.<br> You're attractive, you're--<br> you're quick, you have a lot of energy.<br> - You're obviously<br> a state-of-the-art fellatrix.<br> - What?<br> So-- Nothing, nothing.<br> I'm impressed. Take--<br> - Lenny, don't say "nothing."<br> - I'm impressed.<br> - You think I'm stupid?<br> - I don't think you're stupid, no.<br> - No?<br> - You know, I think you do<br> a stupid thing with your life.<br> But I told you that already.<br> Well, I don't understand<br> why it matters so much to you.<br> Hey, come on. We'll stay for one more<br> race, and this time I'll bet for you.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Let me make the bet.<br> Yeah. N-No. Come on.<br> - We'll just go to the window<br> and I'll make one bet.<br> - All right.<br> Please don't pick one<br> that runs second...<br> - 'cause I want a winner, okay, Len?<br> - Yeah. Hey.<br> You know, they give these horses saliva<br> tests. I can't guarantee anything.<br> - I gave you your winnings, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> That was a great race.<br> Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.<br> Well, he was a heavy favorite, you know,<br> and I bet him to come in third.<br> - At least this way you get something.<br> - Yeah.<br> So, you wanna come in?<br> I gotta go home.<br> I got a wife and kid. You know, I can't.<br> You know, you only talk about me.<br> You never talk about yourself.<br> It's late for me. You know,<br> I had a great time, but I gotta go.<br> I feel I owe you a great fuck.<br> Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs,<br> rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.<br> I can't stay in.<br> I got six dates.<br> Six dates.<br> Slow night for you, right?<br> I wish I had the penicillin concession<br> in your apartment. I'd-- I'd be wealthy.<br> All right.<br> So, you're gonna call me again?<br> Am I gonna call you again?<br> Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry.<br> - You promise?<br> - I will. I'll call you again.<br> Okay. I had a great time.<br> - Bye.<br> - Okay.<br> Whew.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thirty-five years.<br> - I never thought we'd make it.<br> - You and Amanda...<br> have a way to go,<br> but you'll make it.<br> - You guys look so young, both of you.<br> - Yeah, you do.<br> Well, we've kept<br> each other young.<br> Your mother could be your sister,<br> and you could be brother and sister.<br> - You could be my-- yes.<br> - I don't know where that<br> puts me, but anyway--<br> She looks so beautiful,<br> doesn't she, Lenny?<br> - To me, she always looks beautiful.<br> - Mmm.<br> -I just always find her great. And you--<br> When I said sisters before, I mean it.<br> You guys look so great.<br> And it's a wonder,<br> with all the responsibility...<br> she has opening<br> her new gallery.<br> - It's a lot of work.<br> - What new gallery? A new gallery?<br> No, I didn't tell you 'cause,<br> you know, I don't know until<br> it's a hundred percent definite.<br> - Well, did I say the wrong thing?<br> - But it's not.<br> - No, sure. No, I just--<br> - It's a hundred percent definite.<br> You're so insecure.<br> It's happening.<br> - Oh, excuse me.<br> - What is the story on this?<br> - It looks like I have the backing,<br> but it's not totally definite.<br> - That's why I didn't say anything.<br> - Your mother said it was definite.<br> Yeah, well. It seems as if<br> I do have the backing.<br> And there is this wonderful space<br> on Vesey Street. You know it?<br> - Vesey? Yeah, I know it.<br> - Yeah, down in Soho.<br> And it looks like, you know,<br> we think we can get it.<br> The Dorians are putting in<br> some money, but I--<br> - Well, don't look so happy about it.<br> - I am happy!<br> I'm very happy for you, but it's<br> the first I'm hearing of it, you know.<br> - And for your mother to tell me--<br> - Yeah, well, look.<br> I realize that for a time I'm going<br> to be busier than usual...<br> and I know that's<br> a sore point,<br> but, you know, it'll be only<br> 'til it gets off the ground.<br> - Hey, I'm happy for you. I re--<br> - You are?<br> - Yes. I just would have<br> liked to have known it.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - The Amanda Sloane Gallery.<br> I think that it's great.<br> - Yeah, on Vesey Street.<br> Believe me.<br> I haven't even told Jerry Bender yet.<br> "You've got a fine right, you have,<br> after the way you treated Mother,<br> "after the way you treated us all!<br> "A fine right you've got to come back<br> in here in your best country manner...<br> "and strike attitudes<br> and make stands...<br> "and criticize my fiance<br> and give orders...<br> "and mess things up generally<br> as if you'd done--<br> "Well, I can't help it.<br> It's sickening!<br> As if he'd done nothing at all!"<br> Well?<br> What do you think?<br> - About what?<br> - About me.<br> - You think I'm any good?<br> - Yes, it's fine.<br> I-- You know, you're asking<br> the wrong person.<br> I don't know that much about acting,<br> to tell you the truth.<br> Oh, I can tell<br> you're not too impressed.<br> No, no, no. I just thought, you know,<br> it's a very odd part for you to choose.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, you know, 'cause<br> it's The Philadelphia Story.<br> - But I lived in Philadelphia.<br> - What has that got to do with it?<br> - I know the city.<br> - What? You pick a part like this--<br> You should get something<br> closer to yourself.<br> It wouldn't be such a struggle.<br> - You know.<br> - Well, what part should I play?<br> You know-- I don't know.<br> Something closer.<br> Clint Eastwood doesn't play<br> a meek little hairdresser.<br> Well, I could play<br> a hairdresser.<br> I-I used to--<br> I used to do it a lot.<br> I wanted to be one.<br> I was very good at it.<br> - So why'd you give it up?<br> - Well, I don't know.<br> One thing led to another.<br> You know, my aunt worked<br> in a beauty parlor for years.<br> She loved it.<br> Wait. You mean<br> not be an actress?<br> Well, an actress<br> is a very tough life, you know.<br> - But a hairdresser<br> could always make a buck.<br> - A buck?<br> A buck! An honest buck.<br> No beatings, no AIDS.<br> You can meet somebody<br> that you, you know--<br> You can get a family, have a real life,<br> someone that cares for you.<br> Hey!<br> Now, don't you think that I want<br> to meet somebody and get married...<br> and get the hell<br> out of the rat race?<br> I would like to move away<br> and become a mother and just raise kids.<br> I don't even want<br> to be a hairdresser.<br> If Clint Eastwood wants<br> to be a hairdresser, just let him.<br> You missed the point. Clint Eastwood<br> doesn't want to be a hairdresser.<br> I had a kid, Lenny,<br> and I gave him up<br> for adoption.<br> It's the sorriest thing<br> I ever did in my entire life.<br> There's not a day<br> that doesn't go by that I don't...<br> wake up thinking<br> about him.<br> Now some lucky family<br> has him.<br> I just hope to God that they're<br> taking good care of him.<br> Why'd you give him up?<br> I don't know. I was--<br> I was all confused.<br> I had no dough. I-I--<br> I didn't know what to do.<br> I--<br> I didn't even know<br> who the father was.<br> It could've been any one<br> of a hundred guys.<br> Welcome to planet Earth,<br> thanks to a broken condom.<br> Gee. That's tough.<br> Um.<br> What about your kid?<br> Max? M-M-Ma-- You know.<br> Max is the greatest.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Well, sure.<br> Do you have<br> a picture of him?<br> - A picture of Max?<br> - Yeah. I'd like to see him.<br> Oh.<br> Uh, yeah, I guess I--<br> Oh.<br> He's very sweet. He--<br> You're very lucky.<br> With Amanda, it was fate.<br> With Linda, it's hubris.<br> His drive to find out, and now,<br> to change her life, to control her.<br> - Yes.<br> - Danger.<br> Wait. Wait,<br> I see... danger.<br> Hey, wait a minute. I don't have<br> any interest in controlling her.<br> I'm doing this for Max's sake.<br> When the kid gets older, inevitably<br> he's gonna trace his mother.<br> And, you know, I'd be happier...<br> if she was married and a--<br> a hairdresser, you know,<br> rather than the star<br> of The Enchanted Pussy.<br> Danger! I see horrible,<br> horrible danger!<br> - Terrible danger!<br> - Hey, I can handle myself emotionally.<br> Not emotional danger,<br> physical danger.<br> I see a bald man.<br> He has a lead pipe.<br> He's breaking your kneecaps.<br> So, so, uh, what did, uh--<br> How did Jerry Bender take it...<br> when you said that<br> the decision was final?<br> You know what?<br> He was amazing.<br> I thought he'd be upset, but no,<br> he was very excited and very supportive.<br> No, he's being--<br> He was absolutely great about it.<br> Anyway, I-l'm calling to say<br> I can't make dinner tonight.<br> Oh, you're kidding.<br> It's gonna be great.<br> Everybody in the Madison Square Garden<br> organization's gonna be there.<br> Look, there's no way<br> I can get away.<br> The architects are here<br> and the Dorians are in town from Paris.<br> And, uh, the architects fly back<br> to Milan tonight. I can't.<br> All right, well.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> What I'll do is, I'll go home<br> and I'll put Max to sleep.<br> I'll spend a little time<br> there and then--<br> Then-- Oh.<br> Uh, look, let me--<br> I'm gonna call you back. I got, uh--<br> I'm gonna call you back.<br> Oh, geez.<br> It's just against our policy--<br> - I understand!<br> - If you wanna wait right here.<br> - Whatever.<br> -Lenny, there's someone here to see you.<br> -Lenny!<br> - Uh, yes.<br> Uh, c-c-come in. Come in.<br> - Lenny!<br> - Th-This is Miss Gildersleeve.<br> She's an acquaintance.<br> - You know her?<br> - Gildersleeve?<br> - Yes, Miss-- Miss Gildersleeve.<br> We're old-- It's okay. It's okay.<br> I'll be in here.<br> - You don't need anything?<br> - No, no! I'm fine.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm fine.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Lenny? Lenny, I got to talk to you.<br> Ricky threatened to-- to--<br> to hurt me. He--<br> - Who's Ricky?<br> - He takes a percentage of my work.<br> - He's a pimp, right?<br> - No, he's like<br> a business representative.<br> What do you need a business repre--<br> You-- You--<br> All you need is a mattress<br> and a couple of garter belts.<br> You're not a conglomerate.<br> Lenny, he said he<br> was going to cut me up...<br> because I told him I didn't<br> want to work anymore.<br> Well, I think it's a great<br> idea that you want to phase out.<br> - He has no qualms about killing me.<br> - Ohh.<br> Listen, we'll call the police.<br> That's not a big deal.<br> How can I call the police<br> with my setup?<br> You know, I told you<br> a thousand times...<br> you're in a hazardous business.<br> So that's what happens.<br> Now, so-- Don't go outside.<br> I'm not going outside. I thought,<br> just maybe, if you could talk to him.<br> - Me? What, are you nuts?<br> - Yeah, because--<br> Because you're smart and bright<br> and you got a way with words.<br> I can't talk to him.<br> I don't even know the guy.<br> Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea<br> that I get out of the business.<br> So he said he's gonna<br> kill you too.<br> - He said he was gonna kill me?<br> - Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.<br> He's gonna cut up my face<br> and put a bullet between your eyes.<br> Really? Did he--<br> Did he specify the caliber?<br> Listen, I just thought maybe<br> you could just reason with him.<br> No, I can't.<br> I-- Listen, I never told you this,<br> but I got a-- a slight<br> heart murmur...<br> and right now<br> it's murmuring "hide."<br> - I don't believe you're a coward.<br> Only in actuality.<br> Um, this is not for me.<br> - Lenny, I need your help.<br> - No, I'm not a violence person.<br> I-I write about hockey and boxing<br> and football. This is not my world.<br> Lenny, I do want to quit like you said,<br> but he said he's not gonna let me!<br> - He's gonna hurt us both. Please!<br> - Relax, relax.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> How am I gonna talk to him?<br> - Well, okay. You just--<br> - I--<br> You just talk because you're smarter<br> than he is and stronger than he is.<br> You're a much better man. So just<br> remember that when you talk to him.<br> He's a little bit intimidating.<br> He's got a bald head and an earring.<br> - But you'll win. I know you will.<br> - Jesus, I-- I--<br> You're a good man, Lenny.<br> You'll win.<br> Look, in case anything<br> comes up,<br> I want you to know that I-l'm<br> type O-positive, okay?<br> Derek, I got the feeling you<br> came here and obviously moved...<br> into this whole Knick persona.<br> - Did you get caught up, maybe,<br> with a little bit of this Knick,<br> - Excuse me.<br> "I gotta be physical,<br> I gotta be tough," and maybe--<br> I'm, uh, I'm<br> Lenny Gildersleeve.<br> I-- I'm a friend<br> of Linda-- Linda Ash's.<br> And, uh, I thought<br> that perhaps we could--<br> See--<br> What I want to discuss<br> with you is that...<br> there comes a time in the life<br> of every young woman,<br> not just Linda, but everyone,<br> that they-- they want to perhaps<br> make a change in their life.<br> They maybe want to settle down<br> or explore alternative lifestyles.<br> I don't think you've been a very good<br> influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.<br> Weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve<br> is a name I use for business purposes.<br> - I got an investment in Linda.<br> - No question.<br> I honor that. But--<br> But by now, she's probably...<br> repaid you tenfold<br> or twentyfold or--<br> Don't be so fuckin' sure, 'cause you<br> don't know what the fuckin' numbers are!<br> That's a point well taken.<br> Excuse me, you're-- you're-- Excuse me.<br> I-I-I understand what you're saying.<br> Is that a Pellegrino?<br> Can I-- Because you've<br> bent my throat now a little bit.<br> And, uh, the windpipe used to<br> hang straight until this moment.<br> The fuckin' Knicks suck!<br> They need a good shootin' forward.<br> Yes, well, there's gonna<br> be a three-way trade.<br> I don't know if you guys<br> heard anything about it.<br> - Seattle, Atlanta<br> and the Knicks are talking.<br> - Bullshit.<br> - No, no, no. I kid you not.<br> I know. It's in the air.<br> - Yeah?<br> - They're discussing a trade.<br> - So what do you think about the Nets?<br> - You think the Nets got a chance?<br> - The Nets? Yes, I do.<br> If they're injury-free,<br> I think they have a good chance.<br> I like the Nets. I think they're<br> one or two years away, is all.<br> I would say two or three myself.<br> You see, we have a common interest,<br> the three of us.<br> - What were we talking about?<br> - Linda, Linda Ash.<br> Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> That girl's goin' no place.<br> She walks on me, I'll disfigure her<br> and I'll fuckin' kill you.<br> See, that's exactly what<br> Dr. Kleinholtz would call "acting out."<br> - Don't tell me how to run<br> my fuckin' business!<br> - I'm not!<br> My girls do<br> what I tell 'em to do.<br> Far be it for me to advise you.<br> You obviously have a work ethic<br> that's specific to your needs.<br> That's why you can afford<br> an establishment like this, you know.<br> You're gonna take that from him?<br> Take it easy. Take it easy.<br> I'm about to have an<br> out-of-body-experience here.<br> - Show strength.<br> - Show strength?<br> This guy's gonna put me<br> into 27 separate Mason jars.<br> The girl was right. They respect<br> strength. They despise cowardice.<br> Power is all they know.<br> Stand firm.<br> - Remember brave Achilles.<br> - Hey, don't get--<br> Achilles only had an Achilles heel.<br> I have a full Achilles body.<br> - Go on!<br> Look, I'm gonna level<br> with you.<br> I want to discuss<br> this Linda Ash thing and I-I--<br> What are you so interested<br> in Linda for anyway, huh?<br> - Are you fuckin' her?<br> - No, we have a strictly<br> platonic relationship.<br> - Yeah?<br> - It's a good shirt.<br> Well, if you're a friend of hers, don't<br> be putting stupid ideas in her head.<br> She's liable to get hurt.<br> You too.<br> You're gonna<br> let him do that to you?<br> Hey, look. Would you do me a favor<br> and go back to Athens?<br> You gonna let your son's mother remain<br> a white slave to this two-bit pimp?<br> It-- It's starting<br> to look that way, isn't it?<br> - You get them Knicks tickets yet?<br> - No tickets.<br> - I tried everywhere.<br> - Do you need tickets to the<br> Knicks game? Because I--<br> - Why? Who do you know?<br> Me? I-I can help you.<br> We want seats on the floor,<br> next to the movie stars.<br> If you want to discuss a deal with<br> Linda, I can get you courtside seats.<br> You can't get 'em.<br> Nobody can get 'em, 'cause I tried.<br> No, I can, though.<br> I-- I'm a sportswriter. I can get 'em.<br> I'd fuckin' give you my mother<br> for courtside seats,<br> much less this cheap little whore.<br> That's perfectly put, succinctly put.<br> I know what point you're making.<br> - But if you're tryin'<br> to fuckin' pull something,<br> - Easy. Take it--<br> I will shoot you and her<br> through the fuckin' eyeballs!<br> It's silly to haggle over details.<br> Well, I'll get the tickets.<br> I'll get the tickets, I promise.<br> Then we can discuss Linda.<br> Dad, are you very brave?<br> Am I brave?

What?<br> Who would win what?<br> Who'd win a fight,<br> you versus Mike Tyson?<br> - Me versus Mike Tyson?<br> Who do you think would win?<br> - You?<br> There'd be no contest,<br> you know.<br> He would probably take the early rounds,<br> but I'd get to him eventually.<br> I'd chase him all over the ring.<br> It's my style. Always was.<br> On the whole, I think it<br> will work. Yeah, I think it will.<br> The only thing is, I want the gallery<br> to be lit from above,<br> so I guess the skylight<br> will have to be enlarged.<br> - Honey? Bed? Could you?<br> - Me or him?<br> Him. Please?<br> No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I can't do this.

For fixing things up<br> with me and Ricky.<br> - I know he can be really rough.<br> - That was completely unnecessary.<br> Very sweet,<br> but completely unnecessary.<br> You didn't want a blow job, so the least<br> I could do was get you a tie.<br> Good thinking.<br> That's uh-- Oh!<br> - Yes, it's a tie, isn't it?<br> - Would you ever<br> wear anything that bright?<br> - If the occasion demanded.<br> You know, like if I ever get invited<br> to the Mardi Gras, I could--<br> Oh, good.

Thank you.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> - It's great.<br> - Good.<br> You know what, Lenny?<br> I couldn't get your son's picture<br> out of my mind.<br> - Well, he's a very cute kid, you know.<br> - Yeah.<br> Len?<br> I think I would be<br> a good mother.<br> I think you'd be a great mother.<br> You're very affectionate.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> I would like to start over again.<br> Maybe have a house. That would be nice.<br> It would be great, you know.<br> I think it'd be fabulous.<br> - And you could do it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah. Mm-hmm.<br> - The problem is, now,<br> finding the right guy.<br> I need to find somebody<br> who'll love me, you know.<br> Somebody who'll take care<br> of me and respect me.<br> Well, I'll keep my eye open.<br> You know, maybe--<br> maybe-- who knows?<br> The only thing is, Len,<br> he'd have to be as smart as me.<br> I'm sure there's somebody out there,<br> you know, that can--<br> - You'll find an equal somewhere.<br> - Yeah?<br> And don't worry, Len.<br> I gave up on you.<br> - M--<br> - I knew it couldn't be.<br> Let me tell you, at my age,<br> if I made love with you,<br> they would have to<br> put me on a resuscitator.<br> Ha.<br> - This is Max.<br> - Max.<br> - This is my kid.<br> - How old are you?<br> - I'm five.<br> - You're five? You gonna be a fighter?<br> - Yeah.<br> Max is gonna be<br> a middleweight when he gets older.<br> He's gonna be a heavyweight,<br> the way you're carryin' him.<br> I'm gonna teach you how to box, Max.<br> I'm gonna show you a combination punch.<br> One-five, one-five.<br> Two, three and four, you're gonna get.<br> - Hey, Ray.

He's in<br> the best shape of his life.<br> - Yeah?<br> The only thing is, you don't know<br> what these guys do outside the gym.<br> - Well, that's the point.<br> You hear all these stories.<br> - He'll be all right.<br> Hey, Kevin, come here. I wanna introduce<br> you to my friend Lenny Weinrib.<br> - He's a sportswriter.<br> He writes about boxing.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - Listen, I'm gonna get<br> warmed up, all right?<br> - Show us what you can do.<br> - My hand's still a little sore.<br> - Wrap it up good.

She became pregnant<br> with Lenny's child.<br> But not wanting to complicate his life<br> with Amanda, she never told him.<br> Instead she went off<br> with her new husband,<br> who stood behind her loyally as she<br> gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.<br> Lenny never saw Linda again.<br> We can look around the whole store<br> if you'd like.<br> - Lenny!<br> - I don't believe this!

What happened to you?<br> I-I'm living in Connecticut.<br> I'm married and my husband Don<br> is a helicopter pilot.<br> You're kidding! Where did you go?<br> I searched every place for you.<br> - It's like you vanished<br> off the face of the earth.<br> - Well, we had our moment.<br> - But I knew you<br> would be back with Amanda.<br> - I can't b-- That's super.<br> - S-So y-you're married and--<br> This is yours?<br> - Yes!

I'm, I'm--<br> - Lenny, it's so great to see you.<br> - You too. You're okay? Everything--<br> Yeah. I'm really good.<br> Thank you for everything.<br> Oh-- I-I--<br> I'm speechless.<br> I-I-- I gotta go.<br> I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late.<br> - It was great to see you.<br> - It was great to see you. Great.<br> - But they have each other's child.<br> And they don't know.<br> Yes. Yes. Isn't life ironic?<br> Life is unbelievable.<br> Miraculous.
