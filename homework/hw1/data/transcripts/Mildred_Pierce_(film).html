                        Mildred.<br> What's on your mind, lady?<br> You know what I think? I think maybe<br> you had an idea you'd take a swim.<br> That's what I think.<br> Leave me alone.<br> If you take a swim, I'd have<br> to take a swim. Is that fair?<br> You feel like bumping yourself off,<br> I gotta get pneumonia.<br> Never thought about that, did you?<br> Okay. Think about it.<br> Go on, beat it now.<br> Go on home before we both take a swim.<br> Mildred. What are you doing<br> around this pigeon perch? Slumming?<br> - What?<br> - You sick or something?<br> No. I don't think so.<br> If you're feeling weak, come inside<br> and have a drink on the house. For free.<br> Come on.<br> You know, buying this joint was<br> the smartest move I ever made.<br> - Give us a couple drinks, will you, Tony?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I hope you're not sore at me about<br> this afternoon. Strictly business, see?<br> I mean, it might just as well have been you<br> selling me out. You can't expect-<br> What are you looking<br> at me like that for?<br> You can talk your way out of anything.<br> You're good at that.<br> In my business you have to be.<br> Only right now, I'd rather talk myself<br> into something. Know what I mean?<br> - Still trying?<br> - It's a habit.<br> I've tried once a week<br> since we were kids.<br> - Twice a week.<br> - Okay, twice.<br> Anyhow, I'm still drawing blanks.<br> You never used to drink it<br> straight like that.<br> I've learned how these last few months.<br> I've learned a lot of things.<br> - Like, for instance?<br> - Like, for instance, that's rotten liquor.<br> There's better stuff to drink<br> at the beach house, Wally.<br> - Is that a dare?<br> - Could be.<br> All right. I'll take it.<br> You know I like good stuff.<br> - Maybe this is my lucky day.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Come in.<br> - How about your husband?<br> Is he getting broad-minded<br> all of a sudden?<br> Monte isn't here. Besides, you can talk<br> your way out of anything, can't you?<br> I get by all right.<br> - You keep saying that.<br> - Do I?<br> - Nervous, Wally?<br> - No, I'm cold. Temporarily.<br> - Isn't this more comfortable?<br> - Yeah, I guess so, but....<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You don't seem very happy here.<br> - Oh, I'm happy. Believe me.<br> Inside, my heart is singing.<br> - That's pretty corny, Wally.<br> - Well, I'm a corny guy, but I'm smart too.<br> - I wonder about things.<br> - What things?<br> Well, I wonder why<br> you brought me here tonight.<br> I mean, all of a sudden, husband gone,<br> soft lights, quiet room, opportunity.<br> - Why?<br> - Maybe I find you irresistible, Wally.<br> Yeah? You make me shiver, Mildred.<br> You always have.<br> You make love so nicely, Wally.<br> You always have.<br> You know, all my life when I've wanted<br> something, I've gone after it. I get it too.<br> It may take me a little time, okay,<br> but I get what I want.<br> - Do you? It must be nice.<br> - Yeah. It is.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Hey, what's the score?<br> I feel sticky.<br> I think I'd better change my dress.<br> Yeah, sure, Mildred.<br> It's a good idea.<br> I'll only be a minute.<br> - Leave the door open so we can talk.<br> - I like to hear you talk.<br> Yeah? So do I. Something about the sound<br> of my own voice that fascinates me.<br> I'm glad you didn't get sore,<br> the way I took you over the hurdles.<br> I didn't mean to cut up your business the<br> way I did. I got started and couldn't stop.<br> I see an angle, I start cutting myself<br> a piece of throat. It's an instinct.<br> With me, being smart's a disease.<br> Know what I mean?<br> Hm?<br> Hey, Mildred!<br> Hurry up!<br> You know I don't like to drink alone.<br> Hey. Say something. This one-sided<br> conversation is beginning to bore me.<br> Huh?<br> Hey, Mildred.<br> Mildred.<br> Come on, Mildred, don't play games.<br> I'm a nice guy up to a certain point,<br> but don't get me sore. Mildred.<br> Hey.<br> What's the matter?<br> What kind of business is this, anyway?<br> Mildred!<br> Mildred!<br> Hit that house with the light.<br> Hey, stop, you!<br> Okay, okay.<br> What's the hurry, pal?<br> - No gun.<br> - Better take a look in that house.<br> This guy came through that window<br> like he was shot out of a cannon.<br> - Get that from the window?<br> - No, I cut myself shaving.<br> Get going, smart guy.<br> You need some fixing.<br> Oh, brother.<br> I'm so smart, it's a disease.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> What were you doing in there, pal?<br> Picking up souvenirs?<br> No, pal. Nothing petty.<br> This is a pretty big night for you.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah. Lots of excitement.<br> There's a stiff in there.<br> Is that so?<br> And I suppose you were running<br> right to the station to report it?<br> He says there's a dead guy<br> in the house.<br> - You never saw deader.<br> - Better call headquarters.<br> Car 93 calling K-Q-V-B.<br> Car 93 calling K-Q-V-B.<br> Mother, where have you been?<br> They won't tell me anything.<br> - Who won't tell you? Who's "they"?<br> - These men.<br> Mrs. Beragon? We're from headquarters.<br> The inspector would like you<br> to have a little talk with him.<br> - Why? What's the matter?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> We only ask the questions. Besides,<br> we don't know what the trouble is.<br> - It's probably something about the car.<br> - At this time of night?<br> Whatever it is, I'll take care of it.<br> You're not to think about it at all.<br> - Now, go to bed.<br> - Mother.<br> Please, go on.<br> - Can't you tell me what's happened?<br> - We'd better go.<br> What's wrong?<br> Didn't want to say anything<br> in front of her. It's your husband.<br> - He's been murdered.<br> - Murdered?<br> - Hi, Joe, what'd you get?<br> - This is Mrs. Pierce. I mean, Beragon.<br> Which? Pierce or Beragon?<br> Make up your mind.<br> - Mildred Pierce Beragon.<br> - Okay. Wheel her in.<br> Right over there, please.<br> Mrs. Beragon just came in.<br> Sit down. He'll be right with you.<br> Look. I bruise easy.<br> - Ida, what are you-?<br> - No talking.<br> Yeah?<br> Ida Corwin.<br> - Well, what is this, a class reunion?<br> - Looks like it.<br> I'll have a tough time<br> talking my way out of this.<br> - Keep moving.<br> - All right, all right.<br> Hi, Ed.<br> - Charley, what's the good word?<br> - My feet hurt. That's the good word.<br> You got me crying. How about a nice,<br> juicy item for the morning edition?<br> - Nope. Not today.<br> - What's she in for?<br> Parking gum under her seat<br> in a movie. Satisfied?<br> Okay, Charley. Okay.<br> - I'm sorry, Mildred. I just couldn't help it.<br> - No talking.<br> Take a seat.<br> You know that guy?<br> Yes. We were married once.<br> Paper, lady?<br> No, thank you.<br> Yeah?<br> Okay.<br> He wants you now.<br> Now you can talk.<br> Inspector Peterson, Mrs. Beragon.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Won't you sit down?<br> Sorry about your husband.<br> It must be a shock to you.<br> Well, I....<br> I'm afraid I don't quite know<br> how to begin.<br> You see, the fact of the matter is,<br> Mrs. Beragon, we don't need you.<br> You don't need me?<br> I don't know how to apologize for<br> bringing you down here for nothing.<br> But, you understand, we had to be sure.<br> Well, now we are sure.<br> Aren't you going to ask me questions?<br> I thought you would.<br> I know. Everybody thinks detectives<br> do nothing but ask questions...<br> ...but detectives have souls,<br> the same as anyone else.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Go ahead. It's all right.<br> Mrs. Beragon, being a detective is like,<br> well, like making an automobile.<br> You take all the pieces<br> and put them together one by one.<br> First thing you know, you got<br> an automobile. Or a murderer.<br> And we got him.<br> You're in the clear, Mrs. Beragon.<br> The case is on ice.<br> Well, you can go now.<br> All right, men.<br> Could you-?<br> - Would you tell me who-?<br> - Who did it?<br> Sure. You're entitled to know.<br> No.<br> No!<br> Yes, he did it.<br> - Your first husband. Pierce.<br> - No, Bert, I won't let you do this.<br> Wally Fay.<br> How do you know he didn't do it?<br> Fay had no motive. This man had.<br> You see, we start out with nothing.<br> Just a corpse,<br> if you'll pardon the expression.<br> We look at the corpse and we say,<br> "Why? What was the reason?"<br> And when we find the reason,<br> we find the man that made the corpse.<br> In this case, him.<br> Come on.<br> - But he didn't do it. I know he didn't.<br> - Do you?<br> The murder was committed with this.<br> - Do you know who it belongs to?<br> - No. I don't know.<br> We do. It belongs to Pierce.<br> That's fact number one.<br> Fact number two:<br> He doesn't deny killing Beragon.<br> He seems to think it was a good idea.<br> If there's one thing we know...<br> ...it's that an innocent man always<br> denies the crime, loud and often.<br> Pierce doesn't.<br> So do you blame us for feeling<br> fairly confident that he's the man...<br> ...who put four shots<br> out of six into Beragon?<br> But he didn't. He couldn't.<br> He's too gentle and kind.<br> Okay. He's kind and gentle.<br> He's wonderful.<br> But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,<br> why did you divorce him?<br> Because I was wrong.<br> It's taken me four years to find<br> that out, but now I know I was wrong.<br> Let's see. Four years ago he was<br> in the real-estate business, wasn't he?<br> Yes. He and Wally Fay were partners.<br> For a long time they made good money.<br> They built a lot of houses.<br> Suddenly, everybody stopped buying.<br> - The boom was over.<br> - Yes?<br> Then one day they split up.<br> Wally was in and Bert was out.<br> They weren't partners anymore.<br> That day when Bert came home,<br> he was out of a job.<br> - Here's the mail for you, Mr. Pierce.<br> - Thanks, Jack.<br> - Have you got a change-of-address card?<br> - Why, yes.<br> Thank you.<br> We lived on Corvalis Street<br> where all the houses looked alike.<br> Ours was number 1143.<br> I was always in the kitchen.<br> I felt as though I'd lived<br> in a kitchen all my life...<br> ...except for the few hours<br> it took to get married.<br> - That you, Bert?<br> - Yeah. Who else?<br> - I thought it might be Mrs. Whitley.<br> - Well, it isn't.<br> I married Bert when I was 17.<br> I never knew any other kind of life.<br> Just cooking and washing<br> and having children.<br> Two girls, Veda and Kay.<br> I pressed your pants. Though you might<br> want to see McLary about that job.<br> It might be nice if you left me alone once<br> for just five minutes.<br> When the time comes, I'll get a job.<br> I know you will, Bert.<br> I was just trying to help.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Package from E. Langlin.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - What's that?<br> - A dress.<br> - For Veda?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> I thought so.<br> Where'd you get the money?<br> Making cakes and pies<br> for the neighbors. I earned it.<br> Right, throw it up to me that<br> I can't support my own family.<br> I don't say half as much as most women<br> would say with nothing but bills to pay.<br> Keep it up. Maybe there'd be less bills...<br> ...if you didn't raise the kids<br> like I was a millionaire.<br> No wonder they're so fresh<br> and stuck up. That Veda.<br> I'm so fed up with her high-hatting me,<br> one of these days I'll slap her face.<br> Bert, if you ever dare<br> touch Veda, I'll-<br> All right. All right.<br> Trouble is, you're trying<br> to buy love from them, and it won't work.<br> I make enough to get by,<br> but no, that isn't good enough.<br> Veda needs a piano, lessons<br> and fancy dresses...<br> ...so she can smirk her way through<br> a piece a talented 5-year-old could play.<br> Veda has talent.<br> Just ask any of the neighbors.<br> She plays the piano like I shoot pool.<br> And Kay, a nice, normal kid who wants<br> to skip rope and play baseball.<br> But she has ballet lessons. She has to<br> be a ballerina so you can feel proud.<br> All right. What of it?<br> What if I do want them<br> to amount to something?<br> I'd do anything for those kids,<br> understand? Anything.<br> - You can't do their crying for them.<br> - I'll do that too.<br> - They'll never cry if I can help it.<br> - There's something wrong.<br> I don't know what. I'm not smart<br> that way. But I know it isn't right to-<br> - Hello?<br> I just wanted to know if-<br> Yes? Yes, he is.<br> - Who's calling?<br> - Mrs. Biederhof.<br> Just a moment.<br> It's for you. Mrs. Biederhof.<br> Maggie, I can't talk now.<br> I told you not to-<br> - I tried to call you at the office.<br> - I can't talk to you now. Later.<br> So the noble Mr. Pierce<br> can't talk right now.<br> He's busy telling his wife<br> what's wrong with their married life...<br> ...is the way she treats the children.<br> Maggie means nothing to me.<br> You know that.<br> I wish I could believe it.<br> You'd better apologize, or she won't<br> play gin rummy with you anymore.<br> - It is gin rummy, isn't it?<br> - Now, look, don't go too far.<br> - One day, I'll call your bluff.<br> - You're not calling me. I'm calling you.<br> You might as well get this straight.<br> Those kids come first in this house.<br> Before either one of us.<br> Maybe that's right and maybe<br> it's wrong. But that's the way it is.<br> I'll do the best I can for them. If I<br> can't do it with you, I'll do it alone.<br> You're looking for an excuse<br> to heave me out on my ear.<br> - I didn't say-<br> - I'm fed up.<br> Let's see you get along without me. You<br> want me, you know where to find me.<br> Bert.<br> You go to that woman's house,<br> you're never coming back here.<br> I go where I want to go.<br> Then pack up, Bert.<br> All right, I will.<br> - Kids haven't come home yet, huh?<br> - No, not yet.<br> I don't want you to tell them I said<br> goodbye or anything like that.<br> - You can just say-<br> - I know. I'll take care of it.<br> Okay, then I'll leave it to you.<br> Goodbye, Mildred.<br> Go on, Bert. There's nothing<br> more to say. Just go on.<br> One, two, three, hike!<br> Pass it, pass it!<br> Come on!<br> Pass it!<br> - Kay, for goodness' sake!<br> - What's eating you?<br> - You're coming home with me.<br> - I ain't done nothing.<br> - You never let anybody have fun.<br> - Look at your clothes.<br> Honest, Kay, you ought to take<br> more pride in the way you look.<br> - You act like a peasant.<br> - Oh, pretzels, what do I care?<br> You'll care someday, Miss Smarty!<br> Wait till you get interested in boys.<br> I got over that when I was 8.<br> - All right, I'll try. Hello, Mom.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - Good afternoon, Mother.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - Who's the cake for?<br> - Eddie Whitley. It's his birthday.<br> Oh, that goon.<br> - How was your lesson?<br> - I'm learning a new piece.<br> - Are you?<br> - "Valse Brilliante. "<br> - That means "brilliant waltz. "<br> - Does it really?<br> Mm-hm.<br> I saw Father go out.<br> Did you? Why don't you play your<br> new piece for me? I'd love to hear it.<br> All right.<br> When do we eat?<br> Now you stop that<br> or you'll spoil your dinner.<br> - Okay.<br> - Look at your clothes.<br> I know. I should have been a boy.<br> Come on, bring me those dishes<br> off the sink, will you, darling?<br> Okay.<br> - Father had a suitcase with him.<br> - Did he? That's a lovely piece, Veda.<br> - Where was he going?<br> - I don't know.<br> - How long will he be gone?<br> - That's hard to say.<br> Don't stop playing, darling.<br> Is he coming back?<br> Has he gone for good?<br> Look, you might as well know it now.<br> Your father and I<br> have decided to separate.<br> You mean, Dad's not<br> coming home anymore?<br> - Doesn't he like us?<br> - It has nothing to do with you, honey.<br> It just couldn't be helped. We'll have<br> to get along by ourselves now.<br> What did you and Father quarrel about?<br> I can't tell you now.<br> Someday I will, but not now.<br> If you mean Mrs. Biederhof,<br> I must say my sympathy is all with you.<br> - She's distinctly middle class.<br> - Please, Veda. It wasn't Mrs. Biederhof.<br> It was little things.<br> Mostly about your dress.<br> My dress?<br> - It came?<br> - Yes, it's upstairs in your room.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> You ought to do something<br> about your sit-down.<br> - What's wrong with it?<br> - Sticks out.<br> It's the dress. It's awful cheap<br> material. I can tell by the smell.<br> What do you expect,<br> want it inlaid with gold?<br> It seems to me if you're buying<br> anything, it should be the best.<br> - This is definitely not the best.<br> - Quit. You're breaking my heart.<br> Oh, it's impossible.<br> Look at it. Ruffles.<br> I wouldn't be seen dead<br> in this rag. It's horrible.<br> How could she have bought me<br> such a thing?<br> It didn't take me long that night<br> to figure out that I was dead broke.<br> And with Bert gone,<br> it looked as though I'd stay broke.<br> I felt all alone. For the first time<br> in my life, I was lonely.<br> There was so much to remind me of Bert.<br> How things used to be with us.<br> And what great hopes we had.<br> - Hi, Mildred!<br> - Hello, Wally.<br> - Bert around?<br> - Not right now, he isn't.<br> He left things a mess at the office.<br> I thought he could straighten them out.<br> - Ask him to drop over, will you?<br> - lf it's important, find him yourself.<br> He isn't living here anymore.<br> - You mean you've busted up?<br> - Something like that.<br> - For good?<br> - As far as I know.<br> If you don't know,<br> I don't know who does know.<br> - You here all alone?<br> - No, I have the children.<br> Bert must be crazy.<br> You know, I never did mind<br> being around you, Mildred.<br> You don't hear opportunity knocking,<br> do you?<br> Me? I'm conscientious.<br> Not too much ice in that drink<br> you're about to make for me.<br> - You're moving in?<br> - Maybe.<br> Anyhow, I won't cry my eyes out<br> about you and Bert splitting up.<br> I like the idea.<br> It makes me feel good.<br> I wish it made me feel good too.<br> - I like Scotch.<br> - I know what you like.<br> With soda.<br> I've always been soft in the head<br> where you're concerned.<br> - You surprise me.<br> - This is on the level.<br> Bert's gone. Okay. I figure maybe<br> there's a chance for me now.<br> I wouldn't drop dead<br> at the idea of marrying you.<br> Quit kidding, will you?<br> I figured maybe one day<br> you might have a weak moment.<br> If I do, I'll send you<br> a telegram, collect.<br> Easy on the ice for this, will you?<br> No soda?<br> - Sorry. Bert never had it around.<br> - We'll take care of that.<br> - Say when.<br> - Not for me. I'm not used to it.<br> We'll take care of that too.<br> - You're sure of yourself, aren't you?<br> - You gotta be educated.<br> You just joined<br> the world's biggest army.<br> The great American institution<br> never mentioned on the Fourth of July.<br> A grass widow<br> with two children to support.<br> Why don't you make an effort<br> to grow up?<br> You make an effort to forget Bert.<br> - Maybe I don't want to.<br> - But you'll be lonesome.<br> - You can't get along by yourself.<br> - Well, I can try.<br> - Come on, get wise.<br> - Wally, you should be kept on a leash.<br> - Why can't you be friendly?<br> - I am being friendly.<br> I mean it. Friendship's much more<br> lasting than love.<br> Yeah, but it isn't as entertaining.<br> Cut it out. You make me feel<br> like Little Red Riding Hood.<br> And I'm the Big Bad Wolf?<br> You got me wrong.<br> I'm a romantic guy, but I'm no wolf.<br> Then quit howling!<br> I know you romantic guys.<br> One crack about the moon<br> and you're off to the races.<br> - Especially when it looks like a sure thing.<br> - Here we go again.<br> Did I do something wrong?<br> You'd better go, Wally.<br> - No dice, huh?<br> - Good night.<br> Well, no dice, no dice.<br> You can't shoot a guy for trying.<br> I just thought maybe that-<br> Oh, Mildred, I was only kidding.<br> I wouldn't pull any cheap tricks<br> on you.<br> - You know that.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> Why-<br> - I said good night, Wally.<br> - Okay. Round one goes to Mildred.<br> - There won't be any round two.<br> - I'll keep on trying.<br> - I know, once a week.<br> - Twice a week.<br> - Veda! You awake?<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> - Shh. You'll wake Kay.<br> - No. She's tired out.<br> - She cried herself to sleep.<br> - Was it about her father?<br> Yes.<br> Is he going to marry Mrs. Biederhof?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I do.<br> I do know that you should be asleep.<br> - I've been thinking.<br> - What about?<br> - I heard you and Wally talking.<br> - Well?<br> - You could marry him if you wanted.<br> - I'm not in love with him.<br> But then maybe we could have<br> a maid like we used to...<br> ...and a limousine.<br> And maybe a new house.<br> I don't like this house.<br> Neither do I. But that's no reason<br> to marry a man I'm not in love with.<br> Why not?<br> Veda, does a new house mean so much<br> to you that you would trade me for it?<br> I didn't mean it, Mother.<br> I don't care what we have,<br> as long as we're together.<br> It's just that there's<br> so many things that l-<br> That we should have and haven't got.<br> I know, darling. I know.<br> I want you to have nice things.<br> And you will have. Wait and see.<br> I'll get you everything.<br> Anything you want. I promise.<br> How?<br> I don't know.<br> - But I will, I promise.<br> - You darling.<br> - Come on, go to sleep.<br> - All right.<br> - Happy dreams, sweetie.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I love you, Veda.<br> - I love you, Mother. Really, I do.<br> But let's not be sticky about it.<br> Good night.<br> I had to get a job, any kind.<br> I had no experience in the business world,<br> but I had to get a job.<br> I walked my legs off. Getting a job<br> wasn't as easy as I thought.<br> Days seemed like weeks, and everywhere<br> I went I heard the same thing:<br> Sorry, we need people with experience.<br> I was sick at heart<br> when I saw the restaurant.<br> I decided to go in for a cup of tea.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Sit here?<br> Menu.<br> Clear the dirty dishes<br> off number three. Pick up your feet!<br> - Roast chicken is nice.<br> - No, thank you. I'll....<br> I caught you red-handed.<br> I didn't take your rotten tip.<br> - What's the trouble?<br> - She's lifting tips. I've seen her.<br> Go into the kitchen.<br> You keep out of it.<br> How about some service?<br> - Someone will take care of you right away.<br> - I hope so. I have-<br> - You mind your own business.<br> Sorry to leave you like that,<br> but we're so short-handed.<br> - You wanted tea?<br> - No, I want a job.<br> - What?<br> - Well, you seem to need help....<br> I want a job.<br> - You ever work in a restaurant before?<br> - No.<br> Follow me.<br> - Kind of a nervous gal, aren't you?<br> - I'm just a little anxious.<br> You want to watch that.<br> It's tough on dishes.<br> I don't think you're the type for<br> the work, but I'll give you a trial.<br> You need white shoes. Ask for nurses'<br> regulation in any store. $2.95.<br> We furnish the uniform, but it<br> comes off your check. $3.95.<br> You get it at cost.<br> Keep it laundered.<br> If you don't suit us, we charge you 25<br> cents. That comes off your check too.<br> Keep your own tips.<br> Here, have your tea.<br> Thank you.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Ida, what's yours?<br> Mildred Pierce.<br> Chef's salad. Hold the mayonnaise.<br> - Two plates, hold the potatoes.<br> - Two chops, medium and rare.<br> Two chicken dinners.<br> One without gravy.<br> Two chickens. Hold one gravy.<br> Not "without," say hold.<br> I learned the restaurant business<br> the hard way.<br> In three weeks,<br> I was a good waitress.<br> - One chicken. Hold veg.<br> Chicken. Hold veg.<br> Steak, medium. Club san. Roast beef.<br> Hold one. Combin salad.<br> In six weeks, I felt like I'd<br> worked in a restaurant all my life.<br> In three months, I was one<br> of the best waitresses there.<br> I took tips and was glad to get them.<br> And at home I baked pies<br> for the restaurant.<br> Those'll be done in minutes.<br> We have a dozen peach, a dozen berry...<br> ...a dozen pumpkin, a dozen cherry.<br> After we finish the apple, we can quit.<br> I don't know how you keep it up.<br> Honest, I don't.<br> I sleep all morning, but you go to<br> that restaurant and work and work.<br> Just like you been sleeping all night,<br> only you ain't.<br> - It keeps me thin.<br> - Beg pardon?<br> It don't do nothing for me.<br> I was doing all right.<br> I was doing fine.<br> I was able to afford an expensive<br> singing teacher for Veda...<br> ...and a good dancing school for Kay.<br> One thing worried me. That some day<br> Veda would find out I was a waitress.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Everything go all right?<br> - Oh, I had a busy day today.<br> - That's good.<br> - Where did you get that uniform?<br> - Miss Veda.<br> She makes me wear it in case<br> I have to answer the doorbell.<br> Miss Veda gave it to you?<br> I told her you wouldn't like it.<br> I told her right off.<br> But she hollered and went on,<br> so I put it on just to keep her quiet.<br> - Is that what you learned at ballet?<br> - Do you like it?<br> - What have you got on your face?<br> - Well, l-<br> It's just some lipstick.<br> - Lottie!<br> - Yes?<br> Take Kay upstairs and wash her face<br> and give her a good scrubbing.<br> My face don't need scrubbing.<br> I washed it this morning.<br> - Go on, hurry up.<br> - It can stand more soap and water.<br> - Veda.<br> - Yes, Mother, what is it?<br> - Where did you find the uniform?<br> - I was looking for a handkerchief.<br> - In my closet?<br> - I looked everywhere.<br> Your handkerchiefs are always in your<br> top drawer. Why were you in my closet?<br> You're making quite a fuss about<br> something which doesn't matter.<br> If you bought the uniform for Lottie, and<br> I can't imagine who else it would be for...<br> ...then why shouldn't she wear it?<br> You've been snooping since I got this<br> job trying to find out what it is.<br> And now you know, don't you?<br> Know what? Know what, Mother?<br> You knew when you gave that uniform<br> to Lottie that it was mine.<br> - Your uniform?<br> - Yes. I'm waiting tables downtown.<br> My mother. A waitress.<br> I took that job so you and your sister<br> could eat, sleep and have clothes.<br> Aren't the pies bad enough?<br> Did you have to degrade us?<br> - Don't talk like that!<br> - I'm not surprised.<br> You've never spoken of your people,<br> who you came from...<br> ...so perhaps it's natural.<br> Maybe that's why Father-<br> I'm sorry I did that.<br> I'd have rather cut off my hand.<br> I'd never have taken the job<br> if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together.<br> Besides, I wanted to learn<br> the business the best way possible.<br> - What kind of business?<br> - The restaurant business.<br> I'm planning on opening<br> a place of my own.<br> There's money in a restaurant.<br> - You mean we'll be rich?<br> - Some people have gotten rich that way.<br> I didn't know what to do next,<br> but suddenly it hit me.<br> Why not open a restaurant?<br> In the 7th, give me five<br> across the board on Materialize.<br> Hello. Grab a seat.<br> What? I know it's a dog,<br> but I happen to like red horses.<br> Call me back, will you?<br> - Well, well, well.<br> - Hello, Wally.<br> - It's good to see you.<br> - It's nice to see you. Sit down.<br> - I haven't seen enough of you lately.<br> - This is all business.<br> If you keep on refusing me,<br> I'm gonna think you're stubborn.<br> Laugh? No laugh?<br> What's all this?<br> - I'm going to open a restaurant.<br> - You are?<br> - And you're going to help me.<br> - I am? I mean, am I?<br> Please, Wally.<br> I guess I am. What's the score?<br> I found the location. An old house<br> that hasn't been lived in for years.<br> It's on a busy intersection.<br> So it's good for drive-in trade.<br> I clocked an average<br> of 500 cars an hour.<br> Do you realize what that means?<br> There isn't another restaurant<br> in five miles.<br> - It listens good. What's the address?<br> -35904 Glen Oaks Blvd.<br> Who owns it?<br> I don't know,<br> but there's a "For Sale" sign.<br> - Let's see.<br> - I need help in getting this place.<br> You know the angles. I want<br> that house. Please get it.<br> All right. 35907, 35904.<br> There we are!<br> It's listed at $ 10,000.<br> They'll take eight or less.<br> They want to move the property.<br> - And it's owned by the Beragon Estate.<br> - Do you know them?<br> No. They're some wealthy Pasadena family<br> got property here. Beragon Manor.<br> Beragon Estate. There.<br> - Well, what do you know.<br> - What is it? Tell me.<br> Beragons have lost two properties<br> because of back taxes.<br> It sounds as if they're broke. Using<br> your gams all day hasn't hurt them.<br> Hello! Hello! Mr. Beragon, please.<br> Now watch your Uncle Wally go to work.<br> How do you do? This is<br> Wallace Fay of Fay Real Estate.<br> I've been looking forward<br> to calling you for some time.<br> It's regarding your property<br> on Glen Oaks Boulevard.<br> I've succeeded in interesting a client<br> in the possibility of a purchase.<br> - Well, how about...?<br> - This afternoon.<br> Yeah. How about this afternoon?<br> Good. We'll be right down.<br> Fay is the name. No, Fay.<br> That's right. Goodbye.<br> He's sweating blood already.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> And, remember,<br> let me do all the talking.<br> - Oh, Wally, you're wonderful!<br> - Ah, ah. This is all business, remember?<br> Yep! This is it.<br> Will you wait here, please?<br> Mr. Beragon, I talked to you<br> on the phone.<br> This is Mrs. Pierce, the client.<br> How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Would you like a drink?<br> - I'm trapped. You talked me into it.<br> - Mrs. Pierce?<br> As I see it, she wants the house<br> but doesn't want to pay.<br> Well, that's about it.<br> Mrs. Pierce needs time to get started.<br> But once the restaurant is successful,<br> she'll buy the property outright.<br> I see. A very unusual proposition.<br> - How long do you need, Mrs. Pierce?<br> - I'd say about a year.<br> - You think you can make $ 10,000?<br> - Yes, I have it all-<br> Look, if the place is successful,<br> it'll be very successful.<br> If it isn't, you'll get your<br> property back in better condition.<br> What do you say? It's a gamble,<br> but you can't lose much.<br> I like to gamble, Mr. Fay.<br> But the odds are against me.<br> - I'm afraid I'm not interested.<br> - Please, listen to me.<br> This is a gamble for me too.<br> I'm putting every cent<br> I have into this place. I haven't much.<br> I can't afford to lose.<br> I've got all the information.<br> I know what it will cost<br> and how much I can make.<br> I know I can do it. I know I can!<br> - Very well. It's a deal.<br> - Great! I'll draw up the papers.<br> One more thing. We need<br> a pre-dated transfer of ownership.<br> - You want it immediately?<br> - Yeah.<br> We'll give you a note,<br> you give us the deed.<br> You take care of the details.<br> Well, how does it feel to be<br> the owner of a white elephant?<br> Oh, it feels wonderful!<br> How about Uncle Wally?<br> - Nice guy.<br> - Very. Good-looking too.<br> - Maybe, but no brains.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You conning him out of the deed<br> without putting down a cent.<br> - Sure!<br> - You leave the angles to Uncle Wally.<br> - There's one other thing to do.<br> - What's that?<br> Sorry.<br> I don't feel romantic this afternoon.<br> No, nothing like that.<br> It's serious. It's about Bert.<br> - What's on your mind?<br> - You won't like it.<br> You'll have to get a divorce<br> if you want to open that restaurant.<br> What's that got to do with it?<br> In California, they got<br> a community property law.<br> - Half of what's Bert's is yours.<br> - What's half of nothing?<br> It works two ways.<br> Half of what you own is Bert's.<br> You open that restaurant and Bert's<br> creditors will be saying, "Give me. "<br> - Is a divorce the only answer?<br> - Uh-huh. Why?<br> - It takes a year to get a divorce.<br> - Are you getting cold feet?<br> Why bother if it takes a year?<br> It takes a year to be final. Once<br> entered, the creditors can't touch you.<br> - Your worries are over.<br> - I'll be seeing Bert next week.<br> He's coming to take<br> the children for the weekend.<br> - I'll think about it.<br> - Nothing to think about!<br> - No divorce, no restaurant!<br> - I'll think about it, Wally!<br> I'd have to know a little more about<br> it. Divorce is serious. I'm not-<br> - Hello, Dad!<br> - Hello, dear.<br> We'll be down in a minute.<br> Veda wants to know where<br> her new bathing suit is.<br> - It's in the top drawer of her dresser.<br> - Okay!<br> She says it's in the upper drawer<br> of the dresser.<br> Here.<br> I wonder if there are many boys<br> up at Arrowhead.<br> If there are, they're sure to find you.<br> Don't worry.<br> I hate this as much as you.<br> But it's got to be, for the children.<br> I have to think of their future.<br> - Of Veda, you mean.<br> - All right, of Veda.<br> - What about Kay?<br> - Kay doesn't need so much thinking about.<br> Kay's twice the girl Veda is and always<br> will be. She thinks you're wonderful.<br> - Maybe that's why I try to please Veda.<br> - You'll always get kicked around.<br> You ought to know. I've made up<br> my mind. I want a divorce.<br> I want to know a whole lot<br> more about this deal.<br> - What have you got to do with that?<br> - You're my wife.<br> You seem to forget about it<br> when it comes to Maggie Biederhof.<br> - Well, what about you and Wally Fay?<br> - You should know better than that.<br> Bert, listen. I've put everything<br> I've got into this restaurant.<br> I've worked with painters, carpenters,<br> electricians.<br> And suddenly,<br> everything is beginning to take shape.<br> I've worked hard.<br> I'm going to get that divorce.<br> I know. You want me to poke you<br> in the nose...<br> ...so you can claim I was guilty of cruelty.<br> No, Mildred. No divorce.<br> I'm going to file papers.<br> There's little you can do about it.<br> - I don't need your permission.<br> - No? Well, file away.<br> I'll fight you all the way.<br> You and Wally Fay.<br> - And what's more, I'm-<br> You don't have to worry about me.<br> Well, that was quick.<br> My, how nice you look.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Hello, Father.<br> - Goodbye, Mom.<br> - Goodbye, darling.<br> Have fun. Be careful swimming.<br> That water's awfully cold!<br> Bye!<br> - Bye!<br> Dad, on the way,<br> can we stop and have a hamburger?<br> Oh, I guess so.<br> We'll have to hurry, though.<br> It's moments like this that make<br> me happy that nylons are out.<br> Well, if it isn't our silent partner.<br> I've been silent long enough.<br> I came to check on my investment.<br> - Well, how do you like it?<br> - Delightful.<br> Sure you're here<br> to check on your investment?<br> - Oh, absolutely.<br> - Then you'd better look.<br> Over there's the counter. Here will be<br> one table and over here four tables.<br> We have 10 booths, four people<br> to a booth. That's 40 people.<br> - We can expect to feed-<br> - Ingenious.<br> But today's a holiday.<br> Why don't you get out of here?<br> I'd love to, but I'm awfully busy.<br> Isn't the bar beautiful?<br> I've got one at the beach house.<br> Why don't you come see my ocean?<br> I've seen one. If you've seen one,<br> you've seen them all.<br> Why should people come to eat<br> and go someplace else to drink?<br> - That's why I put the bar in-<br> - Logical. But, back to my ocean.<br> Why don't we go have a swim<br> and forget about our investment?<br> Oh, I'd love to, but....<br> - Uh-uh. Got too much to do.<br> - Come on.<br> Look out. I might say yes.<br> - You know what might be highly original?<br> - No. What?<br> Just say yes. Right away like that.<br> No. No, I shouldn't.<br> You'll find that the only things you<br> regret are the things you didn't do.<br> I hope you're right.<br> Look. Why don't I pick you up<br> in, say, 30 minutes.<br> No, I really can't.<br> - How about it?<br> - All right. You win.<br> There you are. Just help yourself. If you<br> don't find what you want, let me know.<br> - Are you hoarding bathing suits?<br> - They belong to my sisters.<br> There's nothing like having<br> a large family.<br> - Yell if you need help with the zipper.<br> - Thank you, but I won't need any help.<br> - How do you like your drink?<br> - Harmless.<br> - I like your ocean.<br> - I borrowed it from the Navy just for you.<br> - You have a wonderful view.<br> - Well, I wouldn't say that.<br> I hope the suit fits better<br> than the robe.<br> It does.<br> Do you live here year round?<br> No, we have a family mansion<br> in Pasadena. Complete with iron deer...<br> ...a ghost and a greenhouse.<br> I come here in the spring.<br> - It must be lovely.<br> - Yes, but lonely.<br> In the spring, a man's fancy turns to<br> what he's thought about all winter.<br> It's a good thing California winters<br> are so short.<br> - No whistle?<br> - I'd need a police siren.<br> - Well, here we go.<br> - Go? Go where?<br> - Swimming. Isn't that why we're here?<br> - I suppose it is. Wait a minute.<br> - Come on.<br> - Hold it.<br> - Drink?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - You drink too much.<br> - I do too much of everything. I'm spoiled.<br> Too many sisters.<br> They all seem to be my size too.<br> Yes. I like them your size.<br> - To brotherly love!<br> - Thank you, Mr. Beragon.<br> Monte Beragon.<br> That's a very unusual name. Spanish?<br> Mostly. Maybe a little<br> Italian thrown in.<br> But my mother is<br> a real dyed-in-the-wool Yankee.<br> That's why I'm such a self-controlled<br> and dignified young fellow.<br> And just what do you do?<br> I loaf in a decorative<br> and highly charming manner.<br> - Is that all?<br> - With me, loafing is a science.<br> - You're very beautiful like that.<br> - I bet you say that to all your sisters.<br> - Shall I tell your fortune?<br> - Can you?<br> We Beragons come from<br> a long line of teacup readers.<br> I'm not very impressionable. I lost<br> my awe of women at an early age.<br> But ever since you came here, I thought<br> of what I'd say when we met again.<br> Now I can't say anything.<br> - You take my breath away.<br> - Do I?<br> I like you, Monte. You make me feel-<br> - I don't know, warm.<br> - And wanted? Beautiful?<br> Yes.<br> When I'm close to you, there's a sound<br> in the air like the beating of wings.<br> - You know what it is?<br> - No. What?<br> My heart. Beating like a schoolboy's.<br> Is it? I thought it was mine.<br> The record.<br> Monte, the record.<br> Is he there yet? That's good.<br> I think I have everything we need.<br> Yeah, I called everywhere.<br> I'll wait another five minutes.<br> Wait. I think she's coming now.<br> Promise?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Thursday? Friday?<br> - Make it Wednesday.<br> - Good. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> I've been nearly nuts.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's Kay. She's sick.<br> We came down from Arrowhead<br> - Well, it's pneumonia.<br> - Oh, no.<br> She isn't here.<br> She isn't here? Where is she?<br> Mrs. Biederhof's.<br> Mrs. Biederhof...<br> I was frantic. I didn't know<br> what to do. I sent for Dr. Gale.<br> It's all right, Bert, just hurry!<br> Mommy!<br> Yes, darling, Mommy's here.<br> More oxygen.<br> I hope it was all right to bring her<br> here instead of the hospital.<br> - But I thought it would save time.<br> You did the right thing.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Thank you very much, Mrs. Biederhof.<br> - Nurse?<br> - Yes, doctor?<br> One more cc.<br> I'm sorry. I couldn't save her.<br> I'm sorry, Mildred.<br> We did everything in our power.<br> I brought her into the world,<br> and it seems hard that I was the one to-<br> I'll fix you a nice, hot cup of tea.<br> I'll never forget her.<br> Never, as long as I live.<br> She said, "Mommy! "<br> And that was all.<br> I loved her so much.<br> Mother.<br> Please, God, don't ever let<br> anything happen to Veda!<br> After that,<br> only one thing was on my mind.<br> To open the restaurant<br> and make it successful.<br> Short stack. Easy on the butter.<br> Adam and Eve on a raft. Hit me hard.<br> - I'm glad you enjoyed it.<br> - We'll come again tomorrow.<br> See you tomorrow. Good night.<br> Too bad you had to stand so long.<br> I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.<br> This way.<br> I'm so glad you liked it.<br> We've been jammed ever since the doors<br> opened. Here you are.<br> Arline, take the orders.<br> - We have great fried chicken.<br> - I'll have it.<br> I hope you like it.<br> Pick up something. Never make a trip<br> with an empty tray like that.<br> - It looks like we're in.<br> - That's what it says here.<br> - Isn't that lovely?<br> - What would I do without you?<br> Probably have a nervous breakdown.<br> - Hello. How are you?<br> - Hello. We got your invitation.<br> I'm glad you came. Suzanne,<br> a booth for Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer.<br> - Congratulations, Mother.<br> - Thank you.<br> - How'd you like to sell?<br> - No. I know a good thing when I see it.<br> So do I. It's some mob.<br> Those postcards you sent out did the trick.<br> Keep my seat and get me a drink.<br> I want to talk to your mother.<br> - What do you want to talk to me about?<br> - It's about Bert. He's coming here tonight.<br> - He is?<br> - He wants to see you about the divorce.<br> - What about it?<br> - He just wants to see you.<br> - Help me. I gotta go to the kitchen.<br> - All right, sure.<br> - Excuse me. I'm sorry.<br> - You big peasant.<br> - Look where you're going.<br> - Excuse me for living. I'm excited.<br> - What's this?<br> - We're swamped. Help us.<br> - Who me? I'm an executive.<br> - Now you're VP in charge of the potatoes.<br> - All right.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You look very pretty.<br> - Thank you.<br> Not at all.<br> What do you know?<br> Beragon just came in.<br> - Did he? He didn't say he was coming.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You been seeing him?<br> - Don't let the potatoes burn.<br> I was just asking.<br> Don't ever go in like that.<br> Put more potatoes on.<br> - You'll never make money that way.<br> - Just so the customers are satisfied.<br> This is just like my wedding night.<br> So exciting.<br> - Will you give Mrs. Pierce these?<br> - Can I tell her your name or is it secret?<br> Tell her they're from<br> an old gypsy fortuneteller.<br> Oh. Well, sit down and read a teacup,<br> and I'll see if she's busy.<br> - Hey, Mildred! Real, live orchids.<br> - For me?<br> Orchids? What is this?<br> Who they from?<br> From an old gypsy fortuneteller<br> with beautiful eyes.<br> - Beg pardon?<br> - Put them in the icebox, Wally.<br> Here, muscles.<br> Put it on this table, please?<br> Oh, I'm sorry,<br> I didn't realize this table was taken.<br> It's quite all right. We're so crowded<br> tonight. Do sit down, Mr. Beragon.<br> Thank you. May I have a dry martini?<br> - So you know me?<br> - Everyone knows the Monte Beragon.<br> You play polo, go yachting,<br> are an excellent hunter.<br> And are seen with the most<br> attractive debutantes.<br> - I read the society section.<br> - I gather.<br> - I should introduce myself.<br> - Don't tell me. Your hand, please.<br> - Can you tell from my hand?<br> - I wouldn't want this to get around...<br> ...but I come from a long line<br> of fortunetellers.<br> - Oh?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - What does it say?<br> - That you are very much like your mother.<br> - Yes?<br> - And it says that her name is Bierce.<br> No. Pierce.<br> - How wonderful.<br> - And it says your name is Veda.<br> - Where does it say "Veda"?<br> - That line right there. Unmistakable.<br> - Well, if it isn't Gypsy Beragon.<br> - The very same.<br> - It looks like a good investment, huh?<br> - Anything would be an improvement.<br> Smile when you say that,<br> a third of this joint belongs to me.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - I've got another proposition.<br> - That orange grove you got-<br> - Save it until later.<br> - Well, here's to success.<br> - Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> Four. Half-and-half.<br> Two special. One Grade A. One black.<br> Hot stuff coming through.<br> That's a wonderful piece.<br> - All you need is a pair of bobby socks.<br> - Maybe Veda will lend me a pair.<br> Well, the last customer<br> just folded his tent.<br> - Good. We've only got one chicken left.<br> - Put my initials on that.<br> I don't know whether<br> I'm on my feet or my ankles.<br> - You must be dead.<br> - Well, if I am, just bury me with this.<br> I wish I felt the way they do.<br> - You've got a nice voice. Did you know?<br> - Thank you.<br> Hi. Congratulations. You're a success.<br> We've been getting acquainted.<br> - He's promised to take me the races.<br> - lf your mother comes too.<br> - I'd love to.<br> - Wally, do me a favor.<br> - Anything.<br> - Take Veda home.<br> - What?<br> - Anyone would think I was a child.<br> - You are. It's past your bedtime.<br> It's not past my bedtime.<br> Besides, I want to take you home.<br> I've got to close up.<br> I'll go home with Ida.<br> Sure is a big night for me.<br> I came out for an evening of fun.<br> What do I get? Dishpan hands<br> and a date with a Girl Scout.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night, Mr. Beragon.<br> Thank you for everything.<br> - I trust that we may meet again very soon.<br> - I hope so.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Pierce. I trust that I might<br> see you in the not-too-distant future.<br> - Come on.<br> - I'm coming.<br> Come on. Never mind. Hurry up.<br> For heaven's sake.<br> Leave something on me.<br> I might catch cold.<br> I was just thinking.<br> Not about you. Come on.<br> - That's a cute youngster of yours.<br> - Isn't she?<br> I thought you had two.<br> - Kay died.<br> - I'm sorry. You should have let me know.<br> - Let's not talk about it.<br> - You've had tough breaks...<br> ...but you're going to make a go<br> of this place.<br> Well, I hope so.<br> - Don't you ever do anything but work?<br> - Somebody's got to.<br> Not all the time. There's a time<br> for work and a time for-<br> Seventeen. Six minus seven.<br> Monte, don't. Not here.<br> Why not? I've been waiting<br> all evening. A lifetime.<br> I didn't mean to bust in like this.<br> - That's all right.<br> This is my husband.<br> Mr. Beragon, Monte Beragon.<br> - I've heard a lot of things about you.<br> - Nice things, I hope.<br> - I'd like to speak to Mildred.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - What is it, Bert?<br> - This'll only take a minute.<br> It's funny. It's harder<br> to say than I thought.<br> It's about the divorce.<br> You can have it.<br> When I walked out, I told you<br> to see if you could get along without me.<br> I didn't think you could.<br> When you asked me for a divorce...<br> ...I still didn't think you<br> could make a go of it alone.<br> Now I know better.<br> You're doing all right.<br> - You're doing fine.<br> - I never thought it would end like this.<br> Who knows how anything<br> is going to end?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Yes, I'm sorry too.<br> Well, that's what I came<br> to say, and now that I've said it...<br> ...I want you to know I wish you<br> all the luck in the world.<br> Thank you, Bert. Thank you.<br> - Well, goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> This calls for a drink.<br> In the Beragon family,<br> there is an old Spanish proverb:<br> One man's poison<br> is another man's meat.<br> Bert!<br> I was in love with him, and I knew it<br> for the first time that night...<br> ...but now he's dead, and I'm not sorry.<br> He wasn't worth it.<br> That may be. Whoever killed him<br> evidently agreed with you.<br> But you haven't given us one reason why<br> your first husband wasn't the murderer.<br> In fact, you've given us<br> a very good reason why he was.<br> Look at it our way. One, Beragon<br> was killed with Pierce's gun.<br> Two, Pierce cannot account for<br> his movements at the time of the murder.<br> Three, he had a motive. You've just<br> given it to us, Mrs. Beragon. Jealousy.<br> This just came in.<br> Thought you'd want it.<br> - Will you excuse me?<br> - Certainly.<br> - Is he sure?<br> - Charley don't like to make mistakes.<br> Just a minute.<br> Mrs. Beragon, we have some<br> information here which puzzles us a little.<br> For instance, your business manager....<br> - Right away.<br> - Okay.<br> Ida Corwin. She tells us that you<br> called her at approximately 11:45 p. m...<br> ...and asked her where Mr. Beragon was.<br> - You seemed quite upset at the time.<br> - It was just a business matter.<br> - Then there was nothing wrong?<br> - No.<br> Occasionally we run across<br> a witness who refuses to tell us...<br> ...what we want to know, except under<br> pressure. Like Wally Fay, for example.<br> Why did you take him to the beach house?<br> Did you know Beragon was there, dead?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - Then you were at the beach house.<br> Why didn't you tell us that before?<br> Why did you run from the house?<br> Wasn't it because you<br> knew Beragon was there, dead?<br> And if you did know, why were you<br> trying to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?<br> I think you'd better<br> tell us the truth now.<br> I did it.<br> I killed him.<br> But why? Your restaurant was a success.<br> You were in love with Beragon.<br> What happened to all that?<br> The restaurant was a greater success<br> than I knew. Profits were enormous.<br> In a few months I opened another place,<br> and then I started a chain.<br> In three years I built five restaurants.<br> Everywhere you went,<br> I had a restaurant. They made money.<br> Everything I touched turned into money,<br> and I needed it. I needed it for Veda.<br> She was becoming a young lady<br> with expensive tastes.<br> Veda was growing up.<br> That Ted Forrester is nice-looking.<br> Veda likes him.<br> Who wouldn't?<br> He has a million dollars.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing. I've just run out of jokes.<br> - What is it? Tell me.<br> - I've had a little bad luck lately.<br> I won't be able to afford<br> many more evenings like this.<br> - Do you need money?<br> - No, no. It isn't anything like that.<br> - I think you do.<br> - Mildred, please don't do that.<br> You've been awfully good to us, Monte.<br> Take it, please.<br> If you say so. But I'll pay it back.<br> I want it understood that it's only a loan.<br> Anything you say,<br> just as long as we're friends.<br> That's how it began. At first it<br> bothered Monte to take money from me.<br> Then it became a habit with him.<br> There's a total here<br> of $ 1480.29 in six months.<br> - What's the big idea?<br> - We owe him a great deal.<br> The restaurant's paid for.<br> You don't owe him a cent.<br> I manage this business,<br> and I've done all right.<br> Keeping Beragon in shirts<br> is not my idea of business.<br> - No?<br> - No!<br> Look, I made this business for you<br> with my own hands.<br> I got banks to give you credit.<br> That wasn't easy.<br> I conned everybody, and for what? So you<br> could have a lap dog named Beragon?<br> - Take it easy, Wally.<br> - When you walked out on Bert...<br> ...I was glad to see you get some sense.<br> - Beragon's worse.<br> - That's none of your business.<br> It is. I helped you so I'd be around when<br> your mind changed. Maybe I was wrong.<br> - Maybe you were.<br> - Beragon is no good. He'll bleed you dry.<br> Suppose I'm in love with him.<br> Huh.<br> Okay.<br> - At least now I know where I stand.<br> - That's right. Now you know.<br> - I hate all women.<br> - My, my.<br> Thank goodness you're not one.<br> Laughing boy seems burned<br> at the edges. What's eating him?<br> - A small, green-eyed monster.<br> - Jealous?<br> Doesn't sound like Wally. No profit in it,<br> and that boy loves a dollar.<br> - I told him I was in love with Beragon.<br> - Are you?<br> I thought I was once, but not now.<br> Good.<br> - What's that?<br> - A $ 1800 birthday present for Veda.<br> - The car. It's here. Where is it?<br> - It's that shiny thing a block long.<br> - Do you think she'll like it?<br> - lf she doesn't, have her head examined.<br> Here, you have to sign this in blood.<br> - It isn't any of my business-<br> - lf it's about Monte, I agree.<br> It's Veda.<br> She's been borrowing money.<br> - From whom?<br> - Anybody. Waitresses mostly.<br> Hasn't she paid them back?<br> They're afraid to say anything<br> or turn her down. You know how it is.<br> Tell them to come to me.<br> I'll see that they're paid.<br> I'm sorry I had to tell you.<br> I don't blame her much.<br> Monte was with her-<br> Did you bring the Laguna Beach<br> and Los Feliz statements?<br> Yeah. They're over here.<br> - Hello, everybody!<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Mother.<br> - Hello Veda, Monte.<br> I hope we aren't interrupting<br> a big conference.<br> - Just a teeny one.<br> - I wish I could get interested in work.<br> You were probably frightened<br> by a callus at an early age. I'll take that.<br> - Thank you.<br> - One missing.<br> You're sitting on<br> the Laguna Beach statement!<br> That's what I like about you.<br> You're so delightfully provincial.<br> I like you too. Don't look now,<br> but you're standing under a brick wall.<br> - I don't get it.<br> - You will, when it falls on you.<br> - When did you start smoking?<br> - Just the other day.<br> Monte gave me this for my birthday.<br> I couldn't hurt him by not using it.<br> I mean, that would have been dreadfully<br> recherch, n 'est-ce pas?<br> Yes, I suppose so.<br> Here's something for your birthday too.<br> I hope you like it.<br> - Mother! A car? Where is it?<br> - Look out the window.<br> - Mother, it's beautiful.<br> - I'm so glad you like it.<br> How about me?<br> After all, I picked it out.<br> Monte, it's the nicest present<br> I ever got.<br> - You're sweet. Let's go for a drive.<br> - Nothing I'd like better.<br> - Do you mind? I'd like to talk to you.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Run along and dent your fenders.<br> - All right.<br> See you later at the club.<br> Be careful.<br> I will.<br> Bye.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I want you to do me a favor.<br> - Sure. What?<br> - Stay away from Veda.<br> What's the matter with me?<br> Have I sprouted two heads?<br> I just don't want you<br> to take her out so much, that's all.<br> And it isn't funny.<br> She's only 17 and spoiled rotten.<br> - What has that got to do with me?<br> - Look, I've worked long and hard...<br> ...to give Veda the things I never had.<br> I've done without a lot of things<br> because I wanted her to have everything.<br> Now I'm losing her.<br> She's drifting away from me.<br> She hardly speaks to me<br> except to ask for money...<br> ...or poke fun at me<br> because I work for a living.<br> - All kids are thoughtless.<br> - Perhaps. I still don't like it.<br> I blame it on the way she's living.<br> And you.<br> I don't think you understand Veda<br> very well. She's not like you.<br> You'll never make a waitress<br> out of her.<br> You look down on me because<br> I work for a living, don't you?<br> All right, I work. I cook food,<br> sell it and make a profit...<br> ...which you're not too proud to share.<br> Yes, I take money from you...<br> ...but not enough to make me like<br> kitchens or cooks. They smell of grease.<br> You don't shrink away from a $50 bill<br> because it smells of grease.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - There's no point in going on like this.<br> You're interfering with my life<br> and business.<br> Worst of all, you're interfering<br> with my plans for Veda.<br> I always knew that someday<br> we'd come to this particular moment.<br> You want Veda and your business<br> and a nice, quiet life.<br> And the price of all that is me.<br> You can go back to making your pies<br> now, Mildred. We're through.<br> Wait a minute, Monte.<br> I forgot something.<br> You've been very good to us. I know<br> you've had expenses taking Veda out.<br> I don't know how much<br> we owe you, but....<br> If that isn't enough,<br> you can let me know.<br> Thank you. I've always wondered<br> how it felt to take a tip.<br> Well, now you know.<br> You can mark<br> our account "paid in full. "<br> - I'd like some of that.<br> - You gotta work for it.<br> Keep your motor running.<br> Bring me three glasses, will you?<br> - This is beginning to look serious.<br> - It is.<br> - Yes, we finally made up our minds.<br> - This calls for a celebration.<br> - Congratulations, Romeo.<br> - You've been swell to us.<br> I get a kick out of doing<br> things for people.<br> - Don't I, Veda?<br> - Absolutely.<br> Looks like we never serve<br> champagne in this joint. Or place.<br> Try this on for size. It's our very best,<br> reserved for special customers.<br> California, '42.<br> Well, here's to....<br> Here's to true love.<br> To true love.<br> The receipts at Arcadia have dropped<br> roughly 7 percent during the last month.<br> - Say, Mildred.<br> - Nearly 8 percent.<br> There's a Mrs. Forrester<br> waiting to see you.<br> - Oh, what about?<br> - Veda.<br> - Excuse me, Mr. Jones.<br> - Do you always interrupt?<br> Only because I want<br> to be alone with you.<br> Come here and let me bite you,<br> you darling boy.<br> - Mrs. Pierce?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm Mrs. Forrester. Ted's mother.<br> - How do you do?<br> Won't you come sit down, it would be<br> more comfortable.<br> I've been looking forward<br> to meeting you, Mrs. Pierce.<br> I'm sure we're going<br> to work out our problem splendidly.<br> - Little problem?<br> - Veda hasn't told you?<br> Told me what?<br> Your daughter has somehow<br> got the idea that-<br> I understand it.<br> Any girl wants to get married.<br> Ted had no such thing in mind.<br> I want that made clear.<br> You mean they're engaged,<br> Veda and Ted?<br> Yes. I'm quite sure you'll agree with me...<br> ...that any discussion of marriage<br> between them would be most undesirable.<br> Why should Veda want to marry<br> your son if he doesn't want to marry her?<br> I'm not a mind reader,<br> but let me tell you...<br> ...if this girl employs any more tricks<br> trying to blackmail my son-<br> - Trying to what?<br> - Understand me, Mrs. Pierce.<br> I shall prevent this marriage<br> in any way that I can.<br> I don't think you need worry.<br> Having you in my family is a pretty<br> dismal prospect. Good afternoon.<br> Veda, I want to talk to you.<br> - Hi, Mildred.<br> - Hello, Wally.<br> - What about?<br> - Mrs. Forrester came to see me today.<br> - Wally, this is private.<br> - That's all right. Wally knows about it.<br> He knows you and Ted<br> want to get married?<br> Want to get married?<br> We are married.<br> We were married on my birthday.<br> - I'm sorry, but it's done.<br> - Veda was trying to spare you.<br> She wanted to make things easier<br> for you so she asked me to help.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> - I wanted to so many times.<br> But you seemed so far away.<br> I couldn't somehow. I was afraid.<br> - Afraid of your own mother?<br> - Mother, I've been so miserable.<br> I made a mistake,<br> and I didn't know how to tell you.<br> Darling, don't you love Ted?<br> No, Mother.<br> I'm sorry about that, Veda.<br> But maybe we don't belong<br> in a family like that.<br> That's right. Veda doesn't love this boy.<br> All right, so she made a mistake.<br> The thing to do is<br> to settle the case out of court.<br> - That's the clean way to handle it.<br> - All right.<br> "I, hereby, of my own free will,<br> renounce all right and title...<br> ...that I, or my heirs and assignees,<br> may have to any moneys or estate...<br> ...real or otherwise, which will accrue<br> or evolve to Theodore Forrester...<br> ...in exchange for considerations<br> of value received. "<br> - Are you agreeable to this?<br> - Why can't we stay married?<br> - You will be good enough to keep quiet.<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> We can assume the waiver<br> is acceptable.<br> - Will you sign this, please?<br> - Yeah, sure. Glad to.<br> My client feels, and I am in complete<br> accord with her, that she has been irrep....<br> - Uh....<br> - Irreparably?<br> Unduly damaged.<br> Therefore, there's one more formality<br> we should discuss.<br> - What's that?<br> - The financial settlement.<br> You see, my client would like $ 10,000.<br> I think I'm safe in observing that<br> almost anyone would like $ 10,000, but....<br> But...?<br> We see no necessity<br> for a financial settlement of any kind.<br> - You don't, huh?<br> - No.<br> - You will.<br> - I doubt it.<br> I don't understand all this.<br> There's no need for a financial settlement.<br> - The only thing we're interested in-<br> - Please, Mother.<br> I need the money.<br> I have to think of the future.<br> That's right.<br> - I'm going to have a baby.<br> - What?<br> - What?<br> Veda.<br> You see, $ 10,000<br> is not entirely unreasonable.<br> - This is moral blackmail, sir.<br> - That's no way to talk about a baby.<br> - I won't pay it.<br> - Yes, you will. Ask your lawyer.<br> Yes?<br> - Yes.<br> - I guess that's about all.<br> You can make out the check<br> to Mrs. Forr- To....<br> Miss Veda Pierce.<br> Well, that's that.<br> I'm sorry this had to happen.<br> Sorry for the boy. He seemed very nice.<br> Oh, Ted's all right, really.<br> Did you see the look on his face when<br> we told him he was going to be a father?<br> - I wish you wouldn't joke about it.<br> - Mother, you're a scream.<br> - Next you'll be knitting little garments.<br> - I don't see anything ridiculous about that.<br> If I were you, I'd save<br> myself the trouble.<br> - You're not going to have a baby?<br> - At this stage, it's a matter of opinion.<br> In my opinion, I'm going to have<br> a baby. I can always be mistaken.<br> - How could you do such a thing?<br> - I got the money, didn't I?<br> I see.<br> I'll have to give Wally part of it<br> to keep him quiet, but there's enough.<br> Money. That's what<br> you live for, isn't it?<br> You'd do anything for money.<br> Even blackmail.<br> - Grow up.<br> - I've never denied you anything.<br> Anything money could buy, I've given you.<br> But that wasn't enough, was it?<br> From now on,<br> things are going to be different.<br> I'll say they are. Why do you think<br> I went to all this trouble?<br> Why do you think<br> I want money so badly?<br> All right, why?<br> - Are you sure you want to know?<br> - Yes.<br> Then I'll tell you. With this money,<br> I can get away from you.<br> Veda.<br> From you and your chickens, pies and<br> kitchens. Everything that smells of grease.<br> I can get away from this shack<br> and its cheap furniture. And this town....<br> Its women that wear uniforms.<br> Its men that wear overalls.<br> I think I'm seeing you for the first time<br> in my life. You're cheap and horrible.<br> You think just because you made money,<br> you can get a new hairdo...<br> ...and some expensive clothes<br> and turn yourself into a lady.<br> But you can't. You'll never be<br> anything but a common frump...<br> ...whose father lived over a store<br> and whose mother took in washing.<br> With this money I can get away<br> from every rotten thing...<br> ...that makes me think<br> of this place or you!<br> Veda!<br> - Give me that check! I said give it to me!<br> - Not on your life!<br> Get out, Veda.<br> Get your things out of this house<br> before I throw them into the street.<br> Get out before I kill you.<br> I went away for a while.<br> I traveled, but not far enough.<br> Something kept pulling me back.<br> Finally, I gave in. I went home.<br> Why, Miss Pierce, this is a day<br> for rejoicing. It certainly is.<br> - How are you?<br> - You look wonderful.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You been away so long.<br> - I've been to Mexico.<br> - Is that a fact?<br> I don't know what we would have<br> done if you'd stayed away longer.<br> - Thank you. It's nice to see you too.<br> - Likewise, I'm sure.<br> - Welcome home.<br> - Thank you. Hi, Ida.<br> - Well, long time no see.<br> - How are you?<br> - How was Mexico?<br> - Crowded.<br> - How's business?<br> - Crowded.<br> - You want your desk back?<br> - No, thanks. On you, it looks good.<br> You know, I like Mexico.<br> It's so Mexican. Thanks.<br> Here.<br> You're in great shape.<br> There's nothing<br> like a nice, long rest, is there?<br> - Got a drink handy?<br> - Yeah. I guess so.<br> Gene, crack open the safe<br> and get out some of that good bourbon.<br> - You never used to drink during the day.<br> - I never used to drink at all.<br> - It's a habit I picked up from men.<br> - Oh, men.<br> I never yet met one who didn't<br> have the instincts of a heel.<br> Sometimes I wish I could<br> get along without them.<br> You've never been married, have you?<br> No. When men get around me,<br> they get allergic to wedding rings.<br> You know, big-sister type.<br> "Good old Ida...<br> ...you can talk it over<br> with her, man-to-man! "<br> I'm getting tired of men talking<br> to me "man-to-man. "<br> - I think I'll have a drink myself.<br> - I'll take mine straight.<br> Well, if you can take it, I can.<br> - Seen anyone I know lately?<br> - You mean Veda.<br> I wondered how long it would take you<br> to get to that.<br> Yes, I mean Veda. Have you seen her?<br> Is she all right?<br> - Why don't you forget about her?<br> - I can't. I've tried, but I can't.<br> Well, try, try again. That's my motto.<br> You don't know what it's like being<br> a mother, Ida. Veda's a part of me.<br> Maybe she didn't turn out as well<br> as I hoped she would...<br> ...but she's still my daughter,<br> and I can't forget that.<br> I went away to try. I was so mixed-up...<br> ...I didn't know where I was<br> or what I wanted.<br> But now I know.<br> Now I'm sure of one thing at least.<br> I want my daughter back.<br> Personally, Veda's convinced me<br> that alligators have the right idea.<br> They eat their young.<br> I'm slightly drunk.<br> - Hello?<br> Is Mildred there?<br> - Yes. Who is it?<br> - This is Bert.<br> Hold on. It's Bert. He's been calling<br> every day on the hour for a month.<br> - Hello, how are you?<br> - How are you? Just get in?<br> I'm fine. I got back this morning.<br> - How about dinner?<br> - What?<br> - Dinner tomorrow?<br> - Tomorrow night?<br> Don't you want to?<br> Of course, but what<br> about Mrs. Biederhof?<br> - She's married.<br> - She is?<br> Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.<br> Oh. Okay, you pick me up<br> at the house at 7:30. Goodbye.<br> Somebody married Mrs. Biederhof.<br> Well, that's a novelty. Remind me<br> to bake a cake. How's Bert?<br> - Huh? Oh, he's fine. He's working now.<br> - No kidding.<br> - He has a job with Condor Aircraft.<br> - Manpower shortage must be pretty bad.<br> To the men we have loved.<br> The stinkers.<br> I never did like this place.<br> Does Wally still own it?<br> Yeah.<br> - Two rum Collins, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I don't know why you insisted<br> on coming here.<br> I thought it was a good idea.<br> Now I'm not sure.<br> I am sorry I did it like this,<br> but I didn't know how to tell you.<br> Mildred.<br> - Hello, Wally.<br> - Hello, Mildred.<br> - Here to see me?<br> - I'm going to take Veda home.<br> - Yeah? Veda know about that?<br> - No. I want you to help me, Wally.<br> Oh, not me. She's your daughter.<br> I've never been a father.<br> Veda's been here for about a month,<br> and I know the best way to handle her.<br> If you want her to do anything for you,<br> just hit her on the head first.<br> I'm telling you. What could he say?<br> He was floored.<br> "Are you kidding?" he says.<br> "No," I says.<br> - The powder room's down the hall.<br> - It's all right. She's my mother.<br> - I didn't know you had a mother.<br> - Everybody has a mother.<br> Yeah. I guess you're right.<br> - This is Miriam. She sings.<br> - That's what they tell me anyhow.<br> - I'm glad to know you.<br> - It's mutual, I'm sure.<br> I guess this calls for a celebration.<br> Maybe I'd better send out for a beer.<br> None for me.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - I want to talk to you.<br> - Go ahead.<br> Well-<br> - Why don't you go see if Wally wants you.<br> - Oh, he won't.<br> Oh, pardon me, I'm sure.<br> Won't you sit down, Mother?<br> Well?<br> I want you to come home, Veda.<br> This isn't your kind of life.<br> - No? What is my kind of life, Mother?<br> - Well, I don't know.<br> Whatever makes you happy, I guess.<br> That's all I've ever wanted for you.<br> - Do you think I was happy in Glendale?<br> - Are you happy here?<br> When I first came here, I used to cry<br> occasionally. I've gotten over that.<br> - You're very fortunate.<br> - I know I've made you unhappy-<br> It isn't easy for me to beg like this,<br> but won't you please come home?<br> No. You must think I'm on a string.<br> "Go away, Veda. " "Come back, Veda. "<br> It isn't that easy. I'm free now.<br> No one tells me what to do. I do<br> what I think best, and I like it that way.<br> I've had the house redecorated. All new<br> furniture. Even a new piano. You'd like it.<br> You still don't understand, do you?<br> You think new curtains<br> are enough to make me happy.<br> I want more than that.<br> I want the kind of life Monte taught me,<br> and you won't give it to me.<br> I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.<br> If I went home, it would start again.<br> You know that. You know how I am.<br> The way you want to live<br> isn't good enough for me.<br> If I could give you the life<br> Monte taught you...<br> ...would you be willing<br> to come home then?<br> But you couldn't, could you, Mother?<br> You can powder your nose just so long.<br> Then people look at you funny.<br> - Anyhow, your number's coming up.<br> - All right.<br> Sorry, Mother. I'm on next.<br> I have to change.<br> - Do you mind?<br> - Not at all.<br> - When will I see you again, Veda?<br> - Just drop around. I'll be here. Bye.<br> Goodbye.<br> So much for the upstairs.<br> It's a little gloomy, isn't it?<br> Not quite so bad down here,<br> with the exception of the entrance hall.<br> As you can see, the pride of the<br> Beragons isn't rolling in wealth.<br> - You're not exhausted?<br> - Not at all.<br> - You can't be serious about buying it.<br> - You're not a very good salesman.<br> No, I suppose I'm not.<br> In here used to be a sitting room.<br> Still is. I do all my sitting here.<br> Becoming quite an expert at it.<br> - Do you live here alone?<br> - There are complete living quarters.<br> Somebody has to be on the premises<br> to show the place.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - Yes.<br> - Can I fix you a drink?<br> - Please.<br> I have the heel of a bottle,<br> no ice or seltzer.<br> - Sorry I can't be more hospitable.<br> - That's all right. I prefer it straight.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I said, I prefer it straight.<br> Oh.<br> - Say when.<br> - When.<br> - What happened to your orange grove?<br> - Sold for taxes like everything else.<br> - The beach house too?<br> - No, not the beach house.<br> An uncle with a little money<br> wouldn't let me sell it.<br> He's hoping to foreclose on it instead.<br> Sounds like a nice uncle.<br> Now, Mildred, what do you want?<br> - Well, I don't understand.<br> - Yes, you do.<br> You don't really want to buy<br> this antiquated tomb.<br> You'd be out of your mind.<br> I don't know. It isn't such a bad<br> house. Remodeling would do wonders.<br> Take off some of that gingerbread<br> and redecorate the inside and-<br> My businesslike air<br> isn't fooling you much, is it?<br> No, I remember too well. I remember<br> how it was with us once, and so do you.<br> It isn't something either of us<br> can forget.<br> - You haven't forgotten?<br> - Not for an hour.<br> - Even this doesn't help.<br> - Then you can do me a great kindness.<br> - lf I can.<br> - Ask me to marry you.<br> Why?<br> I must say, your attitude isn't<br> exactly enthusiastic.<br> You went to considerable trouble<br> to get rid of me once so naturally...<br> ...I'm startled by your proposal<br> of marriage. This is a little sudden.<br> I have my own reason<br> for wanting to marry you.<br> - A reason named Veda.<br> - Why should it be?<br> Because your reason for doing anything<br> is usually Veda.<br> Well, whether it is or isn't,<br> what's your answer?<br> I can't afford you.<br> You have money, and I haven't.<br> All I have is pride and a name,<br> and I can't sell either.<br> - I see.<br> - I'm not enjoying this.<br> Things are very different now<br> from the way they were.<br> - I know. I haven't forgotten.<br> - Neither have I.<br> I want you to love me again<br> the way you did then.<br> I need that more than anything else.<br> I told you then you were<br> the only woman in the world for me.<br> - I loved you then, and I love you now.<br> - Then why-?<br> I can't marry you. I won't go on<br> taking tips from you as I used to.<br> Of course, if I owned a share<br> in your business-<br> Oh, I see. I think I understand now.<br> How much of a share<br> would your pride require?<br> Please don't put it that way.<br> It hurts me to do this.<br> - I'm doing it-<br> - How much of a share?<br> One-third.<br> All right.<br> Sold.<br> One Beragon.<br> - Hello, Lottie.<br> - Why, Mr. Pierce.<br> Is Mrs. Pierce-?<br> Mrs. Beragon, is she in?<br> She's in there.<br> I mean, this way, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's nice to see you again.<br> - It's nice to see you, Lottie.<br> - It's been such a long time. Follow me.<br> Oh, no, no, no. I'm supposed to announce<br> everybody. You stay there. Pardon, please.<br> Please pardon.<br> Mr. Albert Pierce!<br> Lottie, not so loud.<br> - No?<br> - Hello, Bert. It's nice to see you.<br> Thanks. I thought I'd drop in.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> Of course not. Come in, sit down.<br> - Want a drink?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - My hours are too long these days.<br> - Let's sit over here.<br> - This is quite a nifty place.<br> - We just finished redecorating.<br> - You didn't come to the wedding.<br> - I read about it.<br> It was informal.<br> Just Monte's family and friends.<br> I probably have a lot of nerve to ask<br> this, but do you really love this guy?<br> - I married him, didn't I?<br> - That doesn't answer my question.<br> - Monte's okay.<br> - That still doesn't answer me.<br> Are you in love with this guy?<br> No, Bert.<br> I'm not exactly in love with him.<br> But Monte and I understand each other.<br> I thought if I moved from that<br> other house and fixed this place up...<br> - ...I thought, maybe-<br> - Veda would come back.<br> I thought that was why.<br> I know you think I'm a fool, Bert.<br> But I can't help it.<br> I'd do anything to get her back. I couldn't<br> leave her where she was, could I?<br> No, I guess not.<br> Anyhow, that's all I wanted to know.<br> I guess we'll always fight about her.<br> Mildred,<br> I brought you a wedding present.<br> A wedding present?<br> Take a look out that window.<br> - Bert! Did you ask her to come?<br> - No. She called me up.<br> She pretended it was something<br> else. But I got the truth out of her.<br> She wanted to come home, Mildred.<br> Tell her to come in.<br> Veda.<br> I wanted to come home weeks ago.<br> When it was Christmas,<br> I couldn't stay away.<br> - I'm so glad, darling.<br> - I'll change, Mother. I promise.<br> - I'll never say mean things to you again.<br> - I said mean things too.<br> - Mother, this is a beautiful place.<br> - Oh, Bert.<br> I forgot to thank your father.<br> - Bert, I'm very grateful.<br> - That's all right, Mildred.<br> I don't believe it.<br> I simply don't believe it.<br> Well, well, the prodigal returneth.<br> We'll have the fatted calf for dinner.<br> - Hello, Monte!<br> - Hey. Tears of joy at seeing me again?<br> - Of course.<br> - You look lovely, prodigal.<br> It's about time you came to see us.<br> Veda's come home.<br> She's going to stay with us.<br> - lf Monte doesn't mind.<br> - I think it's wonderful.<br> Just don't call me "Father. "<br> Blow, darling, come on.<br> Make a wish.<br> Make a wish first.<br> You can do better than that.<br> Three is all you get.<br> Three is all you get.<br> Happy birthday, Veda.<br> Be careful how you pour<br> that champagne. That's from 1927.<br> - Is that better than '28?<br> - It's the newest we could get.<br> Isn't this a beautiful night?<br> I just love parties, don't you?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Thank you kindly.<br> Yes? Hello. This is the Beragon<br> residence. Who shall I say is calling?<br> Yes, yes, Miss Mildred. I'll call her.<br> Business is business, Mr. Jones.<br> - Just take a look at this receipt.<br> - Hello, Ida. This is Mildred.<br> - How's the party?<br> - Fine. Veda just cut the cake.<br> - Get your clients to agree to more time.<br> - Out of the question.<br> I'll be delayed a little.<br> What's going on? Are you in trouble?<br> You sound so funny.<br> No, I'll tell you about it later.<br> Keep the party going, will you?<br> Okay, Mildred.<br> Get here as soon as you can.<br> - Was that Mother?<br> - Yes. She's at the office.<br> I'm worried. I think<br> she's in some sort of business trouble.<br> It happens in the best of families.<br> Don't look now, but you've got<br> canary feathers all over your face.<br> Business and money is all she<br> thinks about. How about that drink?<br> - Beauty calls. Excuse us.<br> - It's a pleasure.<br> My clients demand an accounting.<br> You must satisfy your creditors<br> or show cause why Mildred's Inc...<br> ...should not be taken away from you.<br> If you resist, your creditors force you<br> into bankruptcy. It's as simple as that.<br> Can they do it?<br> - I'm sorry, Mrs. Beragon.<br> - Yes, so am I.<br> I haven't a cent of ready cash in any<br> of the restaurants. So that's that.<br> I hoped you'd scrape up enough dough<br> to get yourself out of this.<br> - You can still manage the business.<br> - Very nice of you, Wally.<br> Stealing the business from me<br> and then letting me run it.<br> I'm not enjoying this.<br> I haven't any choice.<br> You've bled this business to live<br> the way you have since Veda came home.<br> - I know.<br> - Okay.<br> You let a few bills go by.<br> Pretty soon you're in trouble.<br> The creditors want your hide.<br> I can't stop them.<br> Another month like this,<br> and we're all out.<br> As it is, only I am, right?<br> It looks that way. You'd be all right<br> if Monte hadn't forced it.<br> Monte? What's he got to do with this?<br> I thought you knew. This was his idea.<br> He wants to sell his share.<br> I gotta go along or I'm out.<br> Didn't you know?<br> No.<br> - You married him. I didn't.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Beragon.<br> I'm sorry this happened.<br> If I do say it, as perhaps I shouldn't,<br> I think Mr. Beragon acted badly.<br> Very badly indeed.<br> Good night, Mrs. Beragon.<br> Good night, Jones.<br> Hello, Ida.<br> I want to speak with Monte.<br> He isn't here. He drove off 20 minutes<br> ago, just after the party broke up.<br> I see.<br> Mildred! Mildred!<br> I went to the house.<br> Monte was alone. And I killed him.<br> You're lying. We know you weren't<br> alone in the house with him.<br> We have proof of that.<br> And various other things.<br> Okay, now. Yes.<br> We've had a slant on you from<br> the beginning. You were the key.<br> We had to put the pressure on you.<br> The key turned. The door opened.<br> And there was the murderer.<br> We picked her up at the airport,<br> off a plane for Arizona.<br> She didn't like it much.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - You will. We know all about it.<br> Your mother told us everything.<br> Why did you kill him?<br> You promised not to tell. You promised!<br> You said you'd help me.<br> - Veda, don't say anything more!<br> - Too late. That's all we needed.<br> You left at 11: 15 with Beragon.<br> Your mother left her office at 11:45.<br> You were at the beach house<br> when she got there after midnight.<br> Isn't that right, Mrs. Beragon?<br> Yes.<br> I didn't know Veda was there<br> when I came in.<br> I expected Monte to be alone.<br> We weren't expecting you, Mildred,<br> obviously.<br> It's just as well you know.<br> I'm glad you know.<br> How long has this been going on?<br> Since I came home and even before.<br> He never loved you. It's always been me.<br> I've got what I wanted. Monte's going<br> to divorce you and marry me.<br> No, Veda!<br> There's nothing you can do about it.<br> Mildred!<br> Use your head.<br> This won't solve anything.<br> Just where did you get the idea<br> I'm going to marry you?<br> - Don't joke like that.<br> - I'm not joking.<br> If you think I'm going to marry you,<br> you're mistaken.<br> You told me over and over again<br> that you loved me.<br> - Did I? Then I must have been drinking.<br> - Listen.<br> You don't think I could love<br> a rotten tramp like you, do you?<br> Mildred!<br> Veda. What's happened?<br> It's Monte. He's dead.<br> He said horrible things.<br> He didn't want me around anymore.<br> He told me to get out. Then he laughed<br> at me. He wouldn't stop laughing.<br> I told him I'd kill him.<br> He said I didn't have guts enough.<br> I didn't mean to do it.<br> I didn't mean to, I tell you.<br> But the gun kept going off<br> over and over again.<br> Then he was lying there.<br> Looking at me, just looking at me.<br> You've got to help me.<br> Give me money to get away. And time.<br> I've got to get away<br> before they find him.<br> I can't get you out of this, Veda.<br> What are you going to do?<br> What are you going to do?<br> Number, please.<br> - Give me the police.<br> No. No, Mother. Think what<br> will happen if they find me.<br> - Think what will happen.<br> - I don't care anymore.<br> Yes, you do. Yes, you do.<br> Give me another chance.<br> It's your fault as much as mine.<br> Santa Monica Police.<br> - You've got to help.<br> - O 'Grady speaking.<br> - Help me, Mother.<br> - Just this once!<br> - Hello?<br> - I'll change. I promise I will.<br> - Hello?<br> Give me another chance.<br> It's your fault I'm the way I am!<br> - Santa Monica Police Department.<br> - Help me.<br> Hello?<br> I thought maybe, in a way, it was<br> my fault. So I tried to help her.<br> - I wanted to take the blame for it.<br> - Not this time, Mrs. Beragon.<br> This time your daughter pays<br> for her own mistake.<br> Okay, book her.<br> Darling, I'm sorry.<br> I did the best I could.<br> Don't worry about me, Mother.<br> I'll get by.<br> See that those others are released.<br> We need some fresh air in here.<br> It looks like a nice morning.<br> You can go now.<br> We'll call you when we want you.<br> You know, Mrs. Beragon, there are<br> times when I regret being a policeman.<br>
