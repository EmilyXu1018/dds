                        This is<br> Harvey Milk speaking<br> on Friday, November 18th.<br> This is only to be played<br> in the event of my death<br> by assassination.<br> During one of<br> my early campaigns,<br> I began to open speeches with<br> a line and it became kind of<br> a signature.<br> My name is Harvey Milk<br> and I want to recruit you.<br> (ALL CHEERING)<br> If I was speaking to a<br> slightly hostile audience<br> or a mostly straight one,<br> I might break the tension<br> with a joke.<br> I know. I know I'm<br> not what you expected,<br> but I left my<br> high heels at home.<br> (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)<br> I fully realize that a person<br> who stands for what I stand<br> for,<br> an activist,<br> a gay activist,<br> makes himself the target<br> for someone who is insecure,<br> terrified, afraid<br> and disturbed themselves.<br> It's a very real<br> possibility you see,<br> because in San Francisco,<br> we have broken a dam<br> of major prejudice<br> in this country.<br> MAN 1 ON RADIO: Room 200.<br> I'm in the mayor's office.<br> MAN 2 ON RADIO:<br> We are trying to<br> ascertain what is happening.<br> As President of the<br> Board of Supervisors,<br> it's my duty to<br> make this announcement.<br> Both Mayor Moscone and<br> Supervisor Harvey Milk<br> have been shot and killed.<br> (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)<br> I wish<br> I had time to explain<br> all the things that I did.<br> Almost everything was done<br> with an eye on the gay<br> movement.<br> HARVEY: Hey. Hey.<br> I'm Harvey.<br> Okay, Harvey.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> Today's my birthday.<br> No, hey, actually<br> it is my birthday.<br> At midnight.<br> Really?<br> And, believe it or not,<br> I don't have any plans.<br> Some people took<br> me out after work.<br> Hmm. And that would<br> be at, let me guess,<br> Ma Bell or AT&T.<br> The Great American<br> Insurance Company.<br> Oh.<br> I'm part<br> of that corporate<br> establishment that,<br> let me guess,<br> you think is the cause of<br> all the evil in the world,<br> from Vietnam<br> to diaper rash.<br> You left out bad breath.<br> Just kidding.<br> You're not gonna let me<br> spend my birthday all<br> by myself, are you?<br> Listen, Harvey,<br> you're pretty cute,<br> but I don't<br> date guys over 40.<br> Well, then, this<br> is my lucky night.<br> Why is that?<br> I'm still 39.<br> It's only 11:15.<br> Come on.<br> (SIGHS)<br> What's your name?<br> I'm Scott.<br> Very nice to meet you,<br> Mr. Harvey, insurance man.<br> (MUSIC PLAYING)<br> HARVEY: Where are you from?<br> SCOTT: Jackson, Mississippi.<br> HARVEY: This isn't Jackson.<br> You can't respond to just<br> every strange man<br> that picks you up<br> on a subway platform.<br> It's too dangerous.<br> Hmm, now you tell me.<br> The New York Police<br> are the toughest.<br> They're arrogant<br> and they're everywhere.<br> I'll show you all<br> the cruising spots,<br> but you have<br> to be very careful,<br> little Scotty-san.<br> (CHUCKLES) Are you on<br> some uppers or something?<br> No. This is<br> just plain me.<br> And you're scared<br> of the cops?<br> I'm just discreet.<br> I know a lot of people.<br> If they see me,<br> I could lose my job.<br> Oh, you're one of those.<br> Well, I think you need<br> to find a new scene.<br> Some new friends.<br> I need a change.<br> I know.<br> And you're 40 now.<br> Oh.<br> Forty years old<br> and I haven't done<br> a thing I'm proud of.<br> You keep eating this cake,<br> you're going to be<br> fat by the time you're 50.<br> That's if I ever<br> get to 50. Oh!<br> Happy birthday, old man.<br> Why don't we<br> run away together?<br> (SOFTLY) Where to?<br> HARVEY:<br> In the past,<br> and still now,<br> San Francisco was the place<br> where everyone wanted to go.<br> To drop out,<br> to fall in love.<br> But by 1972,<br> the Haight was boarded up.<br> Drug filled, crime filled.<br> The new place<br> for us refugees<br> was a little Irish<br> Catholic neighborhood<br> in the Eureka Valley,<br> six blocks square,<br> the Castro.<br> (CAMERA CLICKS)<br> (SHIP HORN BLOWING)<br> I cashed my last unemployment<br> check yesterday.<br> HARVEY: Well, I hope<br> you did something<br> useful with it.<br> SCOTT: I bought<br> an ounce of pot.<br> HARVEY: Don't<br> move for a second.<br> I suppose<br> I can wait tables.<br> I don't<br> want you to<br> go anywhere.<br> I want you<br> right here with me.<br> I was thinking<br> about a little shop.<br> What kind of shop?<br> Just a little shop<br> with a little overhead.<br> Not too much work.<br> Just like Morris<br> and Minnie Milk of<br> Woodmere, New York.<br> Did you<br> see the little place<br> downstairs for rent?<br> Yeah.<br> What do you<br> think about that?<br> I think it sounds great.<br> A little bit<br> up on the left.<br> Oh, it looks great.<br> Looks great.<br> Yeah.<br> You're the<br> new renters?<br> Well, hello.<br> Harvey Milk.<br> McConnely.<br> Welcome to Castro Camera.<br> Scott.<br> HARVEY: Yeah. Like,<br> you know, I would like<br> to join the, what's it called,<br> The Eureka Valley Merchants<br> Association.<br> I'm not an interloper.<br> A Jew, perhaps, but I<br> hope you'll forgive that.<br> If you open<br> those doors,<br> the Merchants Association<br> will have the police pull<br> your license.<br> Under what law?<br> Excuse me?<br> There's man's law and<br> there's God's law in<br> this neighborhood<br> and in this city.<br> SCOTT:<br> You know,<br> we pay taxes.<br> The San Francisco police<br> force is happy to<br> enforce either.<br> Have a good day.<br> HARVEY: Yeah,<br> thank you for the warm<br> welcome to the neighborhood!<br> Schmuck!<br> Well.<br> Hey.<br> HARVEY: Okay.<br> Customers, come on in.<br> HARVEY: We'll form our<br> own business association.<br> We'll start with<br> the gay businesses.<br> We'll get the addresses of<br> every customer that comes in<br> the store for a roll of film<br> and we'll ask<br> them what they want,<br> what they need changed.<br> We'll get some<br> money rolling in here.<br> Revitalize the neighborhood.<br> Can I come in now?<br> One more minute.<br> And I can go to<br> the neighborhood banks.<br> They must have<br> some gay customers.<br> Look, Harvey,<br> what's with all this<br> political activist crap?<br> I mean, I thought you<br> were a goddamn Republican.<br> I'm a businessman, Scott.<br> And businesses should be<br> good to their customers.<br> Even if their<br> customers are gay.<br> For God's sake,<br> it's San Francisco!<br> SCOTT: Yeah.<br> Well, it's just like any<br> other city in the country.<br> They hate us.<br> Real surprise.<br> We should have<br> at least one block<br> in one city, right?<br> We start there and then<br> we'll take over the<br> neighborhood.<br> Maybe.<br> I'm coming in.<br> HARVEY: Okay,<br> you can come in now.<br> Finally.<br> This better be good.<br> Oh!<br> Happy birthday!<br> (HARVEY LAUGHING)<br> I had to do it!<br> I had to do it!<br> I had to do it!<br> Sanctuary, sanctuary!<br> Harvey Milk!<br> HARVEY: Sanctuary!<br> And Castro became<br> destination number one.<br> Hundreds of gay men<br> were coming every week<br> from all over the world.<br> It was our area.<br> Our own neighborhood.<br> The police hated us.<br> And we hated them<br> right back.<br> They would come in and<br> attack us and beat us<br> just for fun.<br> But that wouldn't stop us.<br> I made a list of shops that<br> were friendly to us and<br> shops that weren't.<br> Those shops that<br> worked with us thrived.<br> Those that didn't,<br> went out of business.<br> Closed their doors.<br> HARVEY: Excuse me,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> Mr. McConnely,<br> I just came by to see<br> how business was doing.<br> Just fine, Harvey.<br> You don't mind having<br> all these homosexuals<br> in here?<br> (PEOPLE LAUGHING)<br> Kidding, everybody.<br> He loves our kind.<br> Spend away.<br> Tell your wife I said hello.<br> But people started<br> hanging around our store.<br> Not customers.<br> Activists, kids,<br> young people<br> who were looking for<br> a home away from home.<br> (PEOPLE CHATTERING)<br> There was Danny Nicoletta,<br> cute art student that I<br> picked up at Toad Hall,<br> who worked in the shop.<br> (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)<br> Harvey, come on.<br> Opera is so passe.<br> You're<br> not understanding<br> the spectacle of it,<br> the bigger<br> than life emotions.<br> The bigger<br> than life emotions?<br> (IMITATING OPERA SINGER)<br> Jim Rivaldo, a great mind.<br> Harvard graduate,<br> which nobody cared about<br> in those days in the Castro.<br> Including himself.<br> And somewhere<br> along the line, Jim<br> picked up a protege,<br> a cute political kid<br> from Wisconsin,<br> Dick Pabich.<br> And of course,<br> there was Dennis Peron,<br> who ran a very<br> successful business<br> with the young kids.<br> And it wasn't<br> only the gays who<br> noticed what was happening.<br> Also the straight people.<br> There were some<br> very unexpected ones.<br> Teamster leader<br> Allan Baird walked<br> right into my shop<br> and asked me if I could<br> get my people to help<br> boycott Coors beer.<br> And the Coors beer boycott<br> had not been too successful.<br> But I got my people<br> to get all the Coors beer<br> out of all the gay bars,<br> and immediately Coors<br> fell from number one<br> and they caved.<br> A week later,<br> the Teamsters union,<br> for the very first time,<br> hired openly gay drivers.<br> We weren't<br> just a bunch of<br> pansies anymore.<br> We had had our<br> first taste of power.<br> And it was about that time<br> that someone first called me<br> the Mayor of Castro Street,<br> or I may have invented<br> the term myself.<br> The fucking cops, man.<br> Cops are<br> pulling people<br> out of Toad Hall.<br> HARVEY: Why?<br> What did they do?<br> They're<br> sweeping the streets.<br> It's happening right now.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> (PEOPLE CLAMORING)<br> (WHISTLE BLOWING)<br> Through<br> the door there,<br> the front door there,<br> was just an explosion<br> of police charging in here.<br> I ran into the bathroom to<br> hide with some other people.<br> All we could<br> hear was screaming and<br> crunching and smashing.<br> It was frankly the most<br> terrifying experience<br> I've had in my life.<br> If we had<br> someone in government<br> who saw things the<br> way that we see them,<br> like the black community has<br> black leaders that look out<br> for their interests.<br> Politics is theater.<br> It doesn't matter<br> so much about winning.<br> You make a statement.<br> You say, "I'm here."<br> You get their attention.<br> I mean, it'll be fun.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> Even though the Castro was<br> firmly our area by 1973,<br> it wasn't safe for us.<br> We would have to wear<br> whistles on our necks<br> or in our pockets.<br> And if you<br> ever heard a whistle,<br> you would run to help.<br> OFFICER: Fruit was walking<br> home with his trick when<br> he got jumped.<br> Name's Robert Hillsborough.<br> Did you know him?<br> HARVEY: He used to come<br> into my shop. Are there<br> any witnesses?<br> OFFICER: Yeah, just<br> the trick, Jerry Taylor.<br> HARVEY:<br> Jerry's not his<br> trick, he's his lover.<br> OFFICER: Hey,<br> call it what you will.<br> All we know is he's our only<br> witness and he said he can't<br> identify the attackers.<br> HARVEY: Oh, you'd<br> have a dozen witnesses if<br> they thought you boys had any<br> real interest<br> in protecting them.<br> SCOTT ON PA: Hey,<br> come on. Come over.<br> Everyone gather around.<br> Hey, Milk,<br> good job on Coors.<br> Thank you and we<br> were very happy to do that.<br> We were very happy to do that.<br> Everyone over here,<br> gather around.<br> Hello.

HARVEY: The top gays in<br> San Francisco were<br> David Goodstein<br> and his<br> civil rights lawyer<br> sidekick, Rick Stokes.<br> David was a rich old queen<br> who had bought the biggest<br> gay magazine, The Advocate.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, welcome<br> to Mr. Goodstein's.<br> Milo.<br> (WATER SPLASHING)<br> DAVID:<br> I worked for a financial<br> institution in New York.<br> I was very discreet.<br> One night I went to<br> the Metropolitan Opera,<br> II Trovatore, Verdi.<br> I was<br> sitting in a box,<br> next to my lover.<br> Someone spotted us.<br> Next day I was fired.<br> So I decided to do<br> something about it.<br> Came out here<br> to San Francisco,<br> I bought The Advocate.<br> I use my money and my<br> influence, in very subtle and<br> quiet ways, to do what I can.<br> So you<br> think that backing<br> straight candidates<br> is the best<br> way to help us?<br> Yeah, if they're<br> friendly to our cause.<br> Supervisor is<br> a citywide office.<br> Political alliances<br> have to be built.<br> You can't just move here from<br> across the country and run<br> for that office.<br> But I am running for office.<br> I'm on the ballot.<br> I have the union rank<br> and file, I have the<br> seniors.<br> And I would like to have<br> your magazine's endorsement.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> Harvey, we're like<br> the Catholic church.<br> We welcome converts,

works there.<br> It's all about sex and<br> drugs and more sex.<br> David, we need one<br> of our own in office.<br> Harvey,<br> you can't demand<br> acceptance overnight.<br> HARVEY: Why not?<br> The more<br> "out" you make us,<br> the more you incite them.<br> Harvey,<br> step back<br> and quiet down.<br> You're suggesting<br> we should go back<br> in the closet?<br> Is that what<br> you're saying?<br> I spent more years<br> in the closet than<br> I care to remember.<br> Let's go, Scott.<br> SCOTT: Yeah.<br> I don't need your<br> magazine's endorsement.<br> And I'm not asking for<br> anyone's acceptance.<br> I don't have time.<br> DAVID: For you,<br> politics is a game, a lark.<br> It's like putting on<br> a rock festival<br> or staging a love-in.<br> You're too old to be<br> a hippie, Harvey Milk.<br> I am not a candidate.<br> I am part of a movement.<br> The movement<br> is the candidate.<br> There is a difference.<br> You don't see it,<br> but I do.<br> Sorry, I, uh,<br> pissed in the pool.<br> So, on election day,<br> out of 32 candidates<br> vying for six seats,<br> we came in tenth.<br> We lost.<br> But only a few votes shy<br> of my becoming the first<br> big eared, cock-sucking,<br> queer as a<br> three-dollar-bill-man<br> to be elected<br> to public office.<br> So we decided to<br> try it again in 1975.<br> Only this time,<br> with a few adjustments.<br> SCOTT: No.<br> No, not cute.<br> I hate the shoes.<br> I hate the hair.<br> You're not fooling anybody.<br> I'm not<br> gonna let those little<br> Pacific Heights biddies<br> write me off anymore<br> because of a ponytail.<br> I like it.<br> No more bathhouses,<br> no more pot, for me<br> and my little poo.<br> Speak for yourself.<br> Come on.<br> We ran and lost<br> the supervisor's race<br> for the second time in 1975,<br> but with<br> more votes<br> than ever before.<br> So in 1976,<br> against everyone's advice,<br> I really pissed off<br> the political power houses<br> in the Democratic party<br> by running against<br> their man,<br> Art Agnos, who was part<br> of their political machine.<br> And this time,<br> not for supervisor,<br> but for a bigger job,<br> for the California<br> State Assembly.<br> I don't think that<br> State Assembly seats<br> should be the reward<br> for service to the<br> Democratic party machine.<br> Machines run on<br> oil and grease.<br> They're dirty.<br> They're dehumanizing.<br> And they tend to be<br> entirely unresponsive<br> to the needs of anybody,<br> but those of their operator.<br> Mr. Milk, I've been<br> a social worker in<br> this
