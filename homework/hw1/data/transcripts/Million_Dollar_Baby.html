                        Do it!<br> You got him! You got him!<br> I only ever met one man<br> I wouldn't wanna fight.<br> I can't stop that.<br> Get out of here, you useless tit.<br> When I met him, he was already the best<br> cut man in the business.<br> Can you stop it?<br> Started training and managing<br> in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.<br> No.<br> Let me have a look at him.<br> He's fine. He's fine.<br> He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.<br> I'll give you one more round.<br> - Seconds out. Let's go.<br> - What do we do? Tell me what to do.<br> You let him hit you.<br> Sometimes there's just<br> nothing you can do.<br> Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.<br> Maybe you got a severed vein...<br> ... or you just can't get the coagulant<br> deep enough.<br> - Come on!<br> - Break. Break.<br> There are all kinds of combinations<br> you come up against...<br> ... down in the different layers of meat...<br> ... and Frankie knew<br> how to work every one.<br> - That's it! Come on!<br> - What are you doing?<br> Knock him out, Willie!<br> People love violence.<br> They'll slow down at a car wreck<br> to check for bodies.<br> Same people claim to love boxing.<br> They got no idea what it is.<br> Boxing is about respect.<br> Getting it for yourself...<br> ... and taking it away from the other guy.<br> I'll warm up the car.<br> Mr. Dunn?<br> I owe you money?<br> No, sir.<br> I know your mama?<br> Don't rightly know, sir.<br> - Then what is it you want?<br> - I was on the undercard.<br> I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.<br> Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?<br> - Did you happen to see it?<br> - Nope.<br> I did pretty good.<br> Thought you might be interested<br> in training me.<br> I don't train girls.<br> Maybe you should. People see me fight<br> say I'm pretty tough.<br> Girlie, tough ain't enough.<br> It's a mistake.<br> Car should be able to back up, Frankie.<br> Just push, will you?<br> - What did Hogan want?<br> - Offered us a title shot.<br> About time.<br> I turned him down flat.<br> Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.<br> Been two or three more fights<br> for a long time now, Frankie.<br> Look, Willie,<br> you get one shot at the title.<br> You lose it,<br> it may not come around again.<br> Now, two or three more fights<br> and we'll be ready.<br> Whatever you say, Frankie.<br> Frankie liked to say that boxing<br> is an unnatural act...<br> ... that everything in boxing is backwards.<br> Sometimes...<br> ... best way to deliver a punch<br> is step back.<br> Well, do your best, Lord...<br> ...protect Katy.<br> Annie too.<br> Other than that...<br> ...you know what I want,<br> there's no use me repeating myself.<br> But step back too far,<br> you ain't fighting at all.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Father, that was a great sermon.<br> Made me weep.<br> What's confusing you this week?<br> Oh, it's the same old<br> one-God-three-God thing.<br> Frankie, most people figure out<br> by kindergarten it's about faith.<br> Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop<br> all rolled up in one big box?<br> You're standing outside my church<br> comparing God to Rice Krispies?<br> The only reason you come to Mass<br> is to wind me up.<br> - It won't happen this morning.<br> - I'm confused.<br> - No, you aren't.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> Then here's your answer:<br> There's one God.<br> Anything else? Because I'm busy.<br> - What about the Holy Ghost?<br> - He's an expression of God's love.<br> - And Jesus?<br> - Son of God. Don't play stupid.<br> What is he then?<br> Does that make him a demigod?<br> There are no demigods,<br> you fucking pagan!<br> - Did you write your daughter?<br> - Absolutely.<br> Now you're lying to a priest.<br> You know what? Take a day off,<br> don't come to Mass tomorrow.<br> Some people would say the most important<br> thing a fighter can have is heart.<br> Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter<br> who's nothing but heart...<br> ... and I'll show you a man<br> waiting for a beating."<br> Think I only ever met one fighter<br> who was all heart.<br> My name's Dangerous Dillard<br> Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...<br> ...out of Broward County, Texas!<br> Danger showed up<br> a couple of years back.<br> He'd come visiting L.A. With Ervel,<br> his mama's new boyfriend.<br> Apparently Ervel got lost<br> and ended up back in Texas.<br> Danger looked for him for about a week<br> before he introduced himself.<br> Hey, you know, I gots nothing<br> against niggers.<br> Well, that's nice to hear.<br> Yeah, lots of people where<br> I comes from does...<br> ...but my mama taught me<br> not to cause hurt to no man...<br> ...niggers or not.<br> You got a nice mama.<br> Anything else I can do for you?<br> Just one of those questions you ask...<br> ... but Danger wanted to give it<br> his best answer.<br> Well, sir, I'd likes to become<br> the welterweight champion of the world.<br> And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...<br> ...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...<br> ...to fight me for the welterweight<br> championship of the whole world!<br> Yo, Flip, shut up, man!<br> You ain't even ranked.<br> You gotta have at least one fight<br> to be ranked.<br> Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!<br> Hey, you a bad man, huh?<br> Get in the ring. Go a round with me.<br> - Shawrelle.<br> - I will.<br> Leave him alone.<br> Danger, you go on back to training.<br> Will do, Mr. Scrap.<br> Them's some nice tights, Danger.<br> I'll give you that ass-whupping later,<br> Olive Oyl.<br> Hey, bro, those pants look<br> real pretty on you.<br> Give his mama back her tights.<br> Shawrelle Berry had a left hook<br> that would move a tank...<br> ... but he had a heart<br> the size of a split pea.<br> Frankie bought the Hit Pit<br> from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.<br> Bobby wanted to move to Florida,<br> and Frankie wanted some security.<br> Bobby died while he was packing.<br> And Frankie found out<br> most gyms lose money.<br> I thought I told you I didn't want<br> Danger working out here anymore.<br> He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.<br> Well, he's hurting me.<br> Breaking my heart, watching him punch<br> the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.<br> And how many times have I gotta tell you<br> that bleach is bleach?<br> Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?<br> You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.<br> It smells better, Frankie.<br> Bleach smells like bleach.<br> - Hey, Scrap.<br> - Hey, Mr. Willie.<br> Hey, nice fight last night.<br> Nice fight.<br> - Big Willie.<br> - Hey, Sally.<br> - Nice fight.<br> - Thanks, man.<br> People are talking.<br> What the hell kind of language is that?<br> What do you want?<br> I thought you might like to know<br> you got a fighter out there...<br> ...not talking to another manager.<br> Not talking to another manager?<br> And not just any manager.<br> Mickey Mack.<br> You came in here to tell me that Big Willie<br> is not talking to Mickey Mack.<br> Not a word. Neither one of them.<br> I'm trying to read here.<br> Well, if you think that's more important.<br> Who's your new girl?<br> What?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Better hurry up.<br> She keeps hitting it like that,<br> she gonna break her wrists.<br> You're wasting your time.<br> I told you I don't train girls.<br> Thought you might change your mind.<br> Dozens of trainers train girls.<br> You won't have any trouble finding one.<br> Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.<br> You'll do fine.<br> Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,<br> and don't you be calling me that.<br> - Willie, you ready to work?<br> - Anytime.<br> If I stop calling you boss,<br> will you train me?<br> No.<br> Then I might as well keep calling you it.<br> She came from southwestern Missouri...<br> ... the hills outside the scratch-ass<br> Ozark town of Theodosia...<br> ... set in the cedars and oak trees<br> somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.<br> She grew up knowing one thing:<br> She was trash.<br> It's for my dog.<br> She'd come 1800 miles,<br> but Theodosia was still just over the hill.<br> Working the bag, boss.<br> I'm not your boss.<br> And that bag's working you.<br> Give her her money back.<br> You sure?<br> - How much did she pay?<br> - Six months.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> - No, I'll give it back.<br> No, don't be a smartass now, will you?<br> Woman thinks I'll throw away<br> six months' worth of dues...<br> ...just to get rid of her,<br> she's out of her mind.<br> - But just don't encourage her, understand?<br> - Okay.<br> And what's Danger doing out there?<br> What's he looking at?<br> Looks like a bottle of water.<br> He paid his dues?<br> Dues? Boy can't afford pants.<br> Want him to pay dues?<br> Get out of my office.<br> Fuck me.<br> Can't think of it as a bag.<br> I'm not a trainer,<br> but I can show you this if you'd like.<br> Appreciate any help I can get.<br> What you wanna do is,<br> you wanna think of it as a man, see?<br> And he's constantly moving.<br> He's moving towards you, around you,<br> away from you. All right?<br> Don't hit him when he's coming towards you<br> because he's just gonna push you back...<br> ...he's gonna smother your punches<br> and take your balance, right?<br> So you watch him real carefully.<br> Keep rotating.<br> That keeps your head moving.<br> And keep one shoulder back so you're<br> always ready to fire a power shot.<br> Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.<br> Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.<br> Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.<br> Come on around.<br> Keep moving, keep moving.<br> - Good, good, good.<br> - Like that?<br> Yeah. Give it a few shots.<br> Tuck that chin in, now.<br> Tuck that chin in.<br> Yeah, that's good. That's good.<br> Now, you get this down,<br> we'll put you on the speed bag.<br> You do have a speed bag.<br> I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.<br> All right, you go on home now.<br> - I'll walk out with you?<br> - No, I am home.<br> - Wanna see?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's nice.<br> Would it bother you<br> if I worked a little longer?<br> No, just pull the door closed<br> when you leave.<br> Thank you.<br> If there's magic in boxing...<br> ... it's the magic of fighting battles<br> beyond endurance...<br> ... beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys<br> and detached retinas.<br> It's the magic of risking everything<br> for a dream that nobody sees but you.<br> Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.<br> Hey, that's it. That's it.<br> Hands up.<br> Jab, jab, jab.<br> Hey, Flip.<br> Hey, Flippy, come here, man.<br> I think I found somebody you can beat.<br> I don't fights women.<br> Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,<br> because you know why?<br> Because she...<br> Like, you, you could fight to him...<br> ...and then you could kiss to him.<br> Then you fight to him one more time.<br> That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.<br> - It's like poetry.<br> - You been reading and shit.<br> - Thanks, bro.<br> - That's a girl, man?<br> Flip, I think you right. Look at her little<br> bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.<br> Man, that's barely even a mouthful.<br> Let me see.<br> Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.<br> Spent so much time face down,<br> I thought the canvas had titties.<br> Canvas has titties.<br> Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.<br> Just humping the canvas.<br> Humping the floor.<br> Come on, bro. The floor having titties?<br> That's funny, bro.<br> Shut up, man.<br> What you laughing at?<br> Man, hold the bag, stupid.<br> Some titties right there, man.<br> Yo, when they start making those tights<br> for men, Flippy?<br> Punk.<br> All right, that's enough.<br> That's enough for the day.<br> - I'll give you a rubdown.<br> - Oh, I can't, Frankie.<br> Middle one's got a piano lesson.<br> I told Grace I'd drive her.<br> - Something wrong with Gracie's car?<br> - She hates that car.<br> Wants the old one back,<br> but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.<br> Maybe I should talk to the dealer.<br> I'd appreciate that.<br> Okay.<br> - Thanks.<br> - See you later.<br> The man's a rubdown whore.<br> Today he doesn't want one.<br> You ever do any work around here?<br> Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.<br> Little girl seems to be coming along.<br> Yeah. It's almost like<br> someone's been helping her.<br> She might just be a natural.<br> Looks like she's got something.<br> She's got my speed bag,<br> that's what she's got.<br> I wonder how the hell she got that.<br> I wonder.<br> I'm gonna need that speed bag back.<br> - This bag?<br> - Yes, that bag. That's my bag.<br> And if you're hitting it,<br> people will think I'm training you.<br> Is that such a bad thing, boss?<br> Yes. Yes, it is.<br> Every time you touch it,<br> you're losing me business out here.<br> - I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, I can't just lend it<br> to anybody, you know.<br> I understand.<br> Yeah.<br> Look, you seem like a nice girl.<br> - Can I give you some advice?<br> - I'd appreciate that.<br> You'll find a trainer in this gym<br> or somewhere else...<br> ...that's gonna wanna train a girl.<br> It's the latest freak show out there.<br> The trouble is, they're gonna be<br> wasting your time...<br> ...because you're too old.<br> I don't feel that old.<br> Well, neither do I, but you don't see me<br> fighting 21 -year-olds, do you?<br> Takes about four years to train a fighter.<br> How old are you?<br> - Thirty-one until my next birthday.<br> - Oh, well, there you go.<br> Thirty-one.<br> You wouldn't start training to be<br> a ballerina at 31, would you?<br> Already been working it<br> for three years.<br> And you can't hit a speed bag?<br> What kind of training is that?<br> Never had any, boss.<br> Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.<br> Somebody's gotta be honest with you.<br> I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.<br> - You're not gonna cry now, are you?<br> - No, sir.<br> Yeah.<br> Here.<br> - Keep the goddamn thing.<br> - No, you need it.<br> No, take the bag.<br> I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.<br> I've had three since then.<br> Just enjoy it, will you?<br> - I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.<br> - Yeah.<br> Just don't lose it.<br> Yeah, I know, Hogan...<br> ...your guy's the champ,<br> so we don't split 50s...<br> ...but if I don't see 40 percent...<br> Look, you call me back when it's 60-40<br> or don't call me back at all.<br> - Hey, Willie.<br> - Hey, Frankie.<br> Something wrong?<br> I'm sorry to come by your house like this.<br> I know you don't like people dropping in.<br> Oh, you're not people, Willie.<br> You're welcome anytime. Come on in.<br> I wanted to thank you<br> for getting Gracie's car back.<br> Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.<br> Paying an extra thousand dollars<br> for your own car ain't exactly a favor.<br> Gracie cried when she saw it.<br> Really?<br> I also needed to talk with you<br> about business.<br> Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone<br> with Hogan. We're all set for September.<br> Everything but the split.<br> I gotta leave you, Frankie.<br> What?<br> Willie, the title's just two fights away.<br> It ain't that, it's...<br> It's like you said, I got one shot.<br> If I win, I gotta make<br> as much as I can while I can.<br> I need somebody in the action<br> who can make things happen.<br> And I gotta make the change<br> before the fight.<br> Only way this guy say he'd take me<br> is if he took me to the title.<br> So I get you the title fight,<br> and this guy takes you there?<br> Only way he'd do it.<br> I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long<br> you waiting on a title.<br> I wish it could've been with me.<br> Mickey Mack's a businessman.<br> He can't teach you nothing.<br> You already taught me<br> everything I need to know.<br> There's some things people<br> just don't want to hear.<br> And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,<br> Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...<br> ...to fight me for the welterweight<br> championship of the whole world.<br> Danger, I'm wearing<br> these mitts for a reason.<br> Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.<br> Danger, you throw a punch<br> or get the hell out of this gym.<br> Danger, while you thinking about<br> that punch, I'll be right back.<br> I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard<br> for you, Mr. Scrap.<br> No one had the heart to tell Danger<br> that Hearns retired years ago.<br> I heard about Willie.<br> That's cold. That's dead cold.<br> Of course, it wouldn't be so bad<br> if you weren't so damn old.<br> Yeah, well, at least I can see<br> through both eyes.<br> Didn't do you<br> a lot of good though, did it?<br> Well, I've got the gym.<br> Don't need to be training fighters<br> at my age.<br> Willie tell you why?<br> It was Mickey.<br> Mickey's got the connections.<br> Oh, it ain't about connections.<br> It's about you not believing in him.<br> Well, I found him,<br> I stuck with him for eight years.<br> How's that for not believing in him?<br> You could've got him a title fight<br> two years ago. Hell, he knew that.<br> I'm amazed he stayed around this long.<br> Well, getting there and taking home<br> the belt are two different things.<br> What was I supposed to do,<br> just put him in over his head?<br> Not protect him?<br> Oh, you were protecting him<br> from the championship.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, now it makes sense.<br> Well, what about you, Scrap?<br> What did your manager do?<br> You were a hell of a fighter,<br> better than Willie.<br> He get you a title fight,<br> or did he just bust you out...<br> ...banging your head against other<br> people's fists until you lost your eye?<br> I had my shot.<br> I went out swinging,<br> and no man can say I didn't.<br> Yeah, well, I remember.<br> And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter<br> spending the second half of his life...<br> ...cleaning up other people's spit.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> Right, you're the smart one.<br> You're the one learning Greek.<br> It's Gaelic.<br> Well, you just protected yourself<br> out of a championship fight.<br> How do you say that in Gaelic?<br> Sorry.<br> Thanks.<br> The action continues as the champ<br> is battling Big Willie Jones...<br> ... and commanding him<br> with rights and lefts.<br> Up against the ropes,<br> he's hitting him with the left...<br> Boxing is an unnatural act.<br> Because everything in it is backwards.<br> You wanna move to the left...<br> ... you don't step left,<br> you push on the right toe.<br> To move right, you use your left toe.<br> Instead of running from the pain,<br> like a sane person would do...<br> ... you step into it.<br> But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,<br> he hits the champ with a right hand.<br> And the champ is down.<br> Ladies and gentleman,<br> the ref is in for the count.<br> And Big Willie Jones<br> is the new champion of the world.<br> It's unbelievable how<br> this has taken place tonight...<br> ... but there you have it, folks,<br> a new champion.<br> Everything in boxing is backwards.<br> Want a cheeseburger?<br> - You bought me a cheeseburger?<br> - Yeah.<br> I never see you buy anybody<br> a cheeseburger.<br> Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.<br> You want it?<br> Well, I guess the planet<br> can go back to spinning.<br> - You watch the fight?<br> - Yeah, I watched it.<br> Willie did good.<br> That's what you've got to say?<br> Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.<br> I see you been working on yourself,<br> learning to open up. That's good work.<br> You watch it?<br> Yeah, I got HBO.<br> Now, how can you afford HBO?<br> How long have I been telling you<br> to save your money?<br> Ever since I fought<br> Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...<br> ...at the Stadium Club<br> in Tupelo, Mississippi.<br> - That true?<br> - Yeah.<br> Manager ran off<br> and left you and me to hitch home.<br> Don't you remember nothing?<br> Well, I remember walking halfway<br> and thinking I was gonna be lynched.<br> I remember you leaving me with my dick<br> in my hand behind that gas station.<br> Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off<br> before I hardly closed the door.<br> I had to walk back two miles.<br> Your conscience got the better of you,<br> that's what.<br> What the hell's that?<br> It's her birthday.<br> You're not breathing right.<br> That's why you're panting.<br> So it's your birthday, huh?<br> How old does that make you?<br> I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.<br> I'm celebrating that I spent another year<br> scraping dishes and waitressing...<br> ...which is what I been doing since 13.<br> And according to you, I'll be 37<br> before I can even throw a decent punch...<br> ...which after working this speed bag<br> for a month and getting nowhere...<br> ...I now realize may be God's simple truth.<br> Other truth is, my brother's in prison...<br> ...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending<br> one of her kids is still alive...<br> ...my daddy's dead,<br> and my mama weighs 312 pounds.<br> If I was thinking straight,<br> I'd go back home...<br> ...find a used trailer,<br> buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.<br> The problem is, this is the only thing<br> I ever felt good doing.<br> If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.<br> That enough truth to suit you?<br> This your speed bag?<br> Put yours behind the counter.<br> Wish I could say I wore it out.<br> Okay, just hold it. Hold it.<br> I'll show you a few things,<br> and then we'll get you a trainer.<br> No, sorry.<br> - You're in a position to negotiate?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Because I know if you train me right,<br> I'm gonna be a champ.<br> I seen you looking at me.<br> - Yeah, out of pity.<br> - Don't you say that.<br> Don't you say that if it ain't true.<br> I want a trainer.<br> I don't want charity,<br> and I don't want favors.<br> If you're not interested,<br> then I got more celebrating to do.<br> Stop, stop, stop.<br> Goddamn it, stop.<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> Okay.<br> If I'm gonna take you on...<br> - You won't never regret it.<br> - Look, just listen to me.<br> - Lf I take you on...<br> - I promise I'll work so hard.<br> God, this is a mistake already.<br> I'm listening, boss.<br> If I take you on, you don't say anything,<br> you don't question me.<br> You don't ask why, you don't say<br> anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."<br> And I'm gonna try to forget the fact<br> that you're a girl.<br> That's all I ask.<br> And don't come crying to me<br> if you get hurt.<br> - Alrighty.<br> - We got a deal.<br> No, not quite.<br> I'm gonna teach you how to fight...<br> ...then we'll get you a manager,<br> and I'm off down the road.<br> - I hate to argue with you, but...<br> - Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.<br> I teach you all you need to know,<br> and you go off and make a million dollars.<br> I don't care. You get your teeth<br> knocked out, I don't care.<br> I don't wanna hear about it.<br> That's just the way it's gonna be.<br> It's the only way I'll do it.<br> All right.<br> Now, one of the things I've noticed around<br> the gym is you never move your feet.<br> You stand there just flat-footed.<br> You've gotta move your feet.<br> That's one of the best things<br> I can teach you.<br> So here's what you do.<br> You get yourself...<br> Bend your knees a little bit.<br> Get in an athletic position.<br> Look like you're gonna hit something.<br> - Move them how, boss?<br> - Just... Go... Hit the bag.<br> - Stop.<br> - What'd I do wrong?<br> Okay, you did two things wrong.<br> One is you asked a question,<br> and two is you asked another question.<br> Now, what I want you to do,<br> it's not about hitting it hard...<br> ...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.<br> You can count with me if you want.<br> It's just count. On a one-count,<br> I hit right through the bag.<br> - Can you show me that again?<br> - I just...<br> Just say "one," please.<br> - One.<br> - Okay.<br> - One. Okay.<br> - One.<br> Yeah, just say "one." That's good.<br> That's good.<br> Then I move over to my right foot. You'll<br> see my weight is shifting to my right foot.<br> Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort<br> of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.<br> Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,<br> and I hit it with my right hand.<br> And ice pick maneuver again.<br> And I come over on my right foot<br> and hit it right.<br> Don't watch anything but my feet.<br> Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.<br> You show them how to stand,<br> keep their legs under their shoulders.<br> To make a fighter,<br> you gotta strip them down to bare wood.<br> Rest when you're dead.<br> Come here.<br> You can't just tell them<br> to forget everything you know...<br> ... you gotta make them forget it<br> in their bones.<br> Make them so tired<br> they only listen to you.<br> Only hear your voice,<br> only do what you say, and nothing else.<br> Move your feet.<br> Move your feet around. Let's see you go.<br> Show them how to keep their balance<br> and take it away from the other guy.<br> Not so low. Look at me.<br> Right hook and just turn right.<br> How to generate momentum<br> off your right toe.<br> And how to flex your knees<br> when you fire a jab.<br> How to fight backing up, so that the<br> other guy doesn't wanna come after you.<br> Then you gotta show them<br> all over again.<br> Over and over and over...<br> ... till they think they were born that way.<br> Shift.<br> Shift away.<br> Okay. That's enough for today.<br> Good work. Good girl.<br> You think I ready for a fight, boss?<br> Hey. Hey, come here.<br> You're not breathing.<br> Hate to disagree with you.<br> Every time you get under pressure,<br> you're holding your breath.<br> - Now, stop doing that.<br> - Okay.<br> But other than that,<br> I'm doing pretty good, right?<br> - I mean, for a girl.<br> - I don't train girls.<br> Think I might be ready<br> for a fight, boss?<br> Well, we'll get a manager,<br> and we'll find out, won't we?<br> I'd like to,<br> but you been keeping me too busy.<br> - Got any family, boss?<br> - What?<br> You been spending all this time with me,<br> I didn't know if you had any.<br> No.<br> Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.<br> That's family.<br> We're not exactly close.<br> How much she weigh?<br> What?<br> Trouble in my family<br> comes by the pound.<br> Yeah.<br> Not very big.<br> Used to be real athletic.<br> Don't know if she kept it up.<br> So, what do you think?<br> I ready for a fight?<br> Hey, Sally.<br> Come here for a minute, will you?<br> Frankie, I need to see you<br> in the back for a minute, okay?<br> - Can I see you a minute?<br> - Sally here's a real good manager.<br> Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.<br> Looking for a girl, Sally?<br> I'm looking for a good one.<br> Well, see, there you go.<br> Nice working with you, girlie.<br> - What'd you want?<br> - Nothing. It's nothing.<br> I ain't lying, I've been watching you work.<br> You got a hell of a left.<br> Thank you.<br> So you wanna give this a try?<br> See if it's a fit?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> - Good.<br> Because I think you're ready for a fight.<br> Break.<br> What am I doing wrong, Sally?<br> Every time I get inside, she's on me.<br> You're doing great.<br> You're wearing her down. Keep punching.<br> - I ain't doing great, I'm losing.<br> - You're wearing her down.<br> You okay, honey? Can you see okay?<br> - Come on.<br> - Do it.<br> Come on, let's do this!<br> That's it!<br> Nice night, eh?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> That's Lonnie Washington's girl.<br> Hell of a fighter.<br> Your left. Keep your left up.<br> Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.<br> He's got Joey Adagio,<br> lightweight champ?<br> Yeah.<br> Your left, damn it.<br> Wouldn't have been my choice for<br> her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.<br> - He must think she can take her.<br> - Jesus H.<br> Your left. Keep your left up.<br> You think she can hear you<br> from back here?<br> Of course, if Maggie loses,<br> it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.<br> Might even help him.<br> Lonnie's girl gets another win...<br> ...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight<br> fight Joey Adagio for the title.<br> Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?<br> Hey, what do I know?<br> I just come because I enjoy the fights.<br> Mother of God.<br> Okay, break.<br> Hey. Come here, come here.<br> Hey. Get over here.<br> You're dropping your left hand.<br> Quit dropping your left hand.<br> Hey, Frankie,<br> you mind if I talk to my fighter?<br> You're doing a hell of a job.<br> Is this the way you advise your lightweight?<br> Dunn.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm talking. What are you doing?<br> - Is this your fighter?<br> - It's my fighter.<br> It ain't fitting real well, Sally.<br> Fine, you take her.<br> She can't fight worth a shit anyway.<br> - Somebody tell me what's going on.<br> - I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.<br> You telling me this is your fighter?<br> Yeah, this is my fighter.<br> Then you got 10 seconds.<br> I keep holding my left up,<br> then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.<br> - Well, let it drop.<br> - That'd be a lot easier.<br> She thinks she knows you.<br> Every time you drop it,<br> she comes right over the top.<br> So you just wait for her, see?<br> That's all she's thinking about.<br> - When she cocks that right hand... You hear?<br> - I hear you, boss.<br> When she does, step to the side<br> and come with a good-night hook.<br> - Got one?<br> - Got it right here.<br> - Okay.<br> - Fight, or I'm calling it.<br> - Go give it to her.<br> - The body knows what fighters don't.<br> How to protect itself.<br> A neck can only twist so far.<br> Twist it just a hair more,<br> and the body says:<br> "Hey, I'll take it from here because you<br> obviously don't know what you're doing."<br> Neutral corner.<br> - See the way she did that?<br> - Yeah.<br> Sugar Ray would do that.<br> Girl's got sugar.<br> "Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk<br> about this when you regain your senses."<br> It's called the knockout mechanism.<br> Don't get all carried away, now.<br> You did good.<br> Thanks, boss.<br> You... You forgot the rule.<br> - Now, what is the rule?<br> - Keep my left up?<br> It's to protect yourself at all times.<br> Now, what is the rule?<br> - Protect myself at all times.<br> - Good, good.<br> You gave me away.<br> How was that protecting me?<br> It wasn't.<br> It's okay.<br> - I'll work on my left, boss.<br> - Drink your water.<br> Other than that, how'd I do?<br> Fine. You did fine.<br> You gonna leave me again?<br> Never.<br> That place you work, do they have<br> homemade lemon meringue pie there?<br> - Sure.<br> - Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?<br> Oh, big can, yay size.<br> Says "homemade" on the label.<br> - I want you to take the weekend off.<br> - It's only Thursday.<br> - You gonna argue with me?<br> - Know better than to do that, boss.<br> Well, good.<br> All fighters are pigheaded<br> some way or other.<br> Some part of them always thinks<br> they know better than you about something.<br> Can you spare a few minutes<br> for the Immaculate Conception?<br> Truth is, even if they're wrong...<br> ... even if that one thing<br> is gonna be the ruin of them...<br> ... if you can beat that last bit out of them,<br> then they ain't fighters at all.<br> - Thought I said I'd see you Monday.<br> - You sure did, boss.<br> That was last night.<br> You said not to argue with you.<br> Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.<br> You want my advice?<br> What?<br> Where are your shoes?<br> I'm airing out my feet.<br> You got big holes in your socks.<br> Oh, they're not that big.<br> Didn't I give you money<br> for some new ones?<br> These are my sleeping socks.<br> My feet like a little air at night.<br> How come you're wearing them<br> in the daytime, then?<br> Because my daytime socks<br> got too many holes in them.<br> Well, if I give you some more money,<br> you buy some new socks.<br> Please?<br> Well, I'd be tempted,<br> but I couldn't say for sure.<br> Might find its way to the track.<br> It's over. It's over.<br> Didn't take Maggie long<br> to hit her stride.<br> I got the breathing thing down.<br> No, you ain't breathing because you're<br> knocking them out in the first round.<br> - Thought that was the point.<br> - The point is to get good.<br> Can't get good if you keep<br> knocking them out first round.<br> How am I gonna get you fights?<br> Nobody wants to see<br> their fighter embarrassed, now.<br> Why am I still doing<br> four-rounders, boss?<br> Because you haven't got the lungs<br> for six rounds.<br> I do if I keep knocking them out<br> in the first round.<br> Frankie made her fight<br> one more four-rounder...<br> ... just to let her know who was boss.<br> Three, four, five...<br> ...six, seven...<br> Sorry, boss.<br> Maggie left no doubt about it.<br> All right, let's do it.<br> Her first six-rounder<br> didn't go quite as smooth.<br> Get up!<br> To your corner.<br> - Three, four, five...<br> - Get up.<br> ...six, seven...<br> - Get up.<br> ...eight, nine, ten. It's over.<br> - You can do this.<br> Maggie didn't knock her out<br> till the end of the first round.<br> After that, no manager wanted<br> to put his fighter in with Maggie.<br> Frankie had to go into his pocket<br> to get her decent fights...<br> ... sweetening the purse<br> by paying managers on the side.<br> That only worked for so long.<br> Then Frankie did something<br> he hated doing.<br> He took a chance.<br> Box.<br> He moved her up in class.<br> That could've been a mistake.<br> Watch the right!<br> Watch it. Watch it.<br> Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.<br> Damn, damn, damn.<br> Give us two seconds, will you?<br> - Okay.<br> - Just two seconds.<br> - Your nose is broke.<br> - Oh, damn.<br> - Fix it.<br> - I can't, I can't.<br> - You can fix it.<br> - I can't. I've gotta call it.<br> I've seen what you can do. Fix it.<br> I can snap it back into place,<br> but I can't stop the bleeding.<br> The ring doctor's gonna call it.<br> Please, Frankie, if you<br> can stop the blood, I can beat her.<br> Bite down on this.<br> - Inhale.<br> - What?<br> - Inhale.<br> - What?<br> Breathe in.<br> - Okay, huh?<br> - Yeah, it's okay.<br> All right, you got 20 seconds<br> before this turns into a geyser...<br> ...and it's gonna spray<br> all over the front row.<br> Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.<br> Now get going.<br> Go to your corner.<br> Three, four, five...<br> - Come on, breathe. Breathe.<br> ...six, seven, eight...<br> ...nine, ten.<br> Mo cuishle.<br> - All right!<br> - Yeah!<br> Right.<br> What you reading?<br> What's she saying?<br> Wants to know what you're reading.<br> It's Yeats. Keep your head back.<br> Why don't you talk<br> a little Yeats to her.<br> Show her what a treat that is.<br> When the hell they gonna get to her?<br> I'm okay, Frankie.<br> - What'd you learn tonight?<br> - Always protect myself.<br> - What's the rule?<br> - Always protect myself.<br> - Margaret Fitzgerald?<br> - Here.<br> I'll be right here.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah, you.<br> - I'm not the one who's hurt.<br> Broken nose don't hurt that much.<br> Why are you telling me that?<br> No reason.<br> But some wounds are too deep<br> or too close to the bone.<br> And no matter how hard you work at it,<br> you just can't stop the bleeding.<br> - Did you write your daughter?<br> - Every week.<br> I've no idea why you come to church.<br> After her 12th straight knockout,<br> Frankie got a couple of real good offers.<br> The first was to fight<br> Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...<br> ... for the WBA welterweight title.<br> Billie "The Blue Bear."<br> Billie was a former prostitute<br> out of East Berlin.<br> Had a reputation for being<br> the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.<br> Didn't seem to matter to her...<br> ... that something like that<br> could kill a person.<br> And the crowds loved her.<br> He turned it down<br> without even telling her.<br> The next was to fight<br> the British champ...<br> - ... a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.<br> - Hello?<br> Not interested.<br> He turned that down too.<br> That's a lot of money, boss.<br> Yeah, you're making money.<br> What are you still working here for?<br> It's a title match, right?<br> Are you British?<br> It's a title you can't take away.<br> She's got nothing to lose,<br> you got nothing to win.<br> Might still be a good fight.<br> Yeah, I just... I just brought you up<br> to welterweight.<br> Too good to fight these contenders,<br> you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?<br> Didn't notice I was fighting<br> any contenders.<br> Well, you can get yourself<br> another manager any time you want.<br> In fact, if you'd learn<br> to protect your face a little better...<br> ...I wouldn't have<br> to turn down this money.<br> My face is out there so much it's a miracle<br> I haven't been knocked out yet.<br> No, you can't work here<br> anymore tonight.<br> I made us a reservation.<br> You might wanna shower.<br> Here you go.<br> Here you go.<br> What's this?<br> Well, it ain't no big secret<br> what you're wishing for.<br> Go on and blow.<br> Thank you.<br> Thirty-three ain't so old.<br> I was still fighting at 39.<br> Fought for 23 years.<br> How's it going, Scrap?<br> Doing good, Mickey.<br> Doing good.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - Coffee.<br> You two not speaking?<br> Don't hardly know him.<br> I met Frankie right after<br> my 37th birthday.<br> He was picking up cut work.<br> He used to patch me up<br> when I thought it was impossible.<br> Good man to have in your corner.<br> Yes, he is.<br> He stayed with me<br> through my last fight in San Berdu.<br> My manager was off<br> getting drunk somewhere...<br> ...and it was just Frankie and me.<br> I was taking a hellacious beating.<br> Everybody's got a particular number<br> of fights in him.<br> Nobody tells you what that number is.<br> Mine was 109.<br> I just didn't want to admit it.<br> Fourth round, this...<br> ...cut opens up.<br> Blood starts pouring into my eye.<br> They should've stopped the fight, but,<br> hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.<br> Blood was what I was there for.<br> Round after round, I kept getting<br> Frankie to patch me up.<br> He's talking about<br> throwing in the towel...<br> ...but he ain't my manager,<br> he can't throw in nothing.<br> Round after round...<br> ...he's arguing with me.<br> And I'm almost laughing because, hell,<br> it's getting more to him than to me.<br> I go 15 rounds...<br> ...Iose by decision.<br> Next morning, I lose the eye.<br> In 23 years, he's never said<br> a thing about it.<br> Doesn't have to. I can see it<br> in his face every time he looks at me.<br> Somehow...<br> ...Frankie thinks he should've<br> stopped that fight...<br> ...should've saved my eye.<br> Spends his life wishing he could<br> take back that 109th fight.<br> I wanted to go to 110.<br> Thing is...<br> ...if you wanna get to the title...<br> ...maybe he's not the one<br> to take you there.<br> You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?<br> You go on, eat your cupcake.<br> No, I got it.<br> It's the rule.<br> Always protect yourself.<br> People never take their own advice.<br> If she was gonna leave Frankie,<br> better she did it to him then.<br> Mr. Mickey Mack?<br> I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.<br> I hear you're a real good manager,<br> doing good things for Big Willie.<br> But I thought you should know<br> I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...<br> ...so you don't need to make any more<br> excuses to bump into me.<br> Sorry for interrupting your dinner.<br> Maggie always did like<br> taking them out in the first round.<br> The letters always came back<br> marked the same way:<br> "Return to sender."<br> I'll make you some coffee.<br> What are you doing with your money?<br> - Saving it.<br> - Good girl.<br> You know, you save enough of it,<br> you ought to get yourself a little house.<br> Cash, no mortgage.<br> Gonna be a while before I can do that.<br> Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...<br> ...but you gotta get yourself<br> a place of your own.<br> Go around wasting it on things<br> that don't matter and what do you got?<br> You understand?<br> Pretty soon, you wait long enough,<br> you got nothing.<br> Okay, soon as I get the money.<br> I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just<br> trying to keep you from doing the same.<br> I know, boss.<br> - I'm not gonna live forever.<br> - What is it?<br> It's a tape on that girl in England<br> you're gonna fight.<br> If you're gonna go for the title,<br> we got some moves to...

Mo cuishle.<br> - Mo cuishle.<br> She wasn't the main attraction.<br> She was on the undercard<br> of a middleweight title fight.<br> But ask someone who was there...<br> ... they couldn't tell you who else<br> fought that night.<br> Box.<br> - Come on!<br> - Mo cuishle!<br> Mo cuishle!

You're fine, you're working...<br> ...but I can't live without my welfare.<br> Mama, I'll send you money.<br> What about my medicine?<br> Medicaid gonna cut me off.<br> - How am I supposed to get my medicine?<br> - I'll send you more money.<br> I hope you don't expect J.D.<br> To move in with us.<br> He's getting out, you know.<br> Why didn't you just give me the money?<br> Why'd you have to buy me a house?<br> I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.<br> You want the money, sell it.<br> I don't...<br> I know you didn't mean<br> nothing hurtful...<br> ...but sometimes you just<br> don't think things through.<br> - That's true, Mama.<br> - I'll try and keep the house.<br> I'm just worried about<br> all those expenses.<br> I'll send you some more money.<br> That man hitting you?<br> It's from the fight.<br> I'm a fighter, Mama.<br> Find a man, Mary M.<br> Live proper.<br> People hear about what you're doing<br> and they laugh.<br> Hurts me to tell you,<br> but they laugh at you.<br> Hi.<br> You ever own a dog?<br> Nope.<br> Closest I ever came was<br> a middleweight from Barstow.<br> My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.<br> Axel's hindquarters were so bad...<br> ...he had to drag himself<br> room to room by his front legs.<br> Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...<br> ...watching him scoot<br> across the kitchen floor.<br> Daddy, he was so sick by then,<br> he couldn't hardly stand himself.<br> But one morning he got up,<br> carried Axel to his rig...<br> ...and the two of them went off<br> into the woods, singing and howling.<br> But it wasn't till he got home<br> that night alone that I saw...<br> ...the shovel in the back of the truck.<br> Sure miss watching<br> the two of them together.<br> I got nobody but you, Frankie.<br> Well, you've got me.<br> At least, that is,<br> until we find you a good manager.<br> Hey, can we stop just up here?<br> Yeah.<br> This place has<br> the best lemon pie around.<br> None of that canned-filling crap.<br> Now I can die and go to heaven.<br> I used to come here with Daddy.<br> Wonder if a place like this is for sale.<br> I got a little bit of savings.<br> That's fine, fine, thanks.<br> Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?<br> Looks like another bottle of water.<br> Wanna come to Vegas with us?<br> Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?<br> My heart can't take that kind of pounding.<br> Well, she's got a title shot.<br> The Blue Bear.<br> Million dollars,<br> split right down the center.<br> That's good, Frankie.

Break it!<br> Fitzgerald continues to pummel<br> The Blue Bear. The East German champion...<br> Yes! Come on!<br> I got it! I got it.<br> Eyes are blurring, boss.<br> - How many eyes you need to finish this?<br> - One's enough.<br> - Good.<br> - Now...<br> ...what do I do about the Bear?<br> Do you know that step into the outside<br> and hook into the liver?<br> - I been doing that. She's made of steel.<br> - I don't want you to go to the liver.<br> I want you to hit her right up<br> under her skinny ass, understand?<br> Right in the sciatic nerve.<br> Just keep digging it in there.<br> And just keep sticking her.<br> You hear that?<br> - What about the ref?<br> - Keep between the ref and the Bear...<br> ...and everything will just be fine.<br> This is yours.

Does it hurt much?<br> Don't hurt at all.<br> Well, that's good.<br> Where's Frankie?<br> Well, he's...<br> He's out there talking to the doctors.<br> Probably telling them how to do their job.<br> They're telling him<br> I'm a C1 and C2 complete.<br> Means that my spinal cord's so broke<br> they'll never be able to fix it.<br> Gonna be frozen like this<br> the rest of my life.<br> I asked them to tell him.<br> I don't know how he's gonna take it.<br> Did you see the fight?<br> Of course I did.<br> You had her cold, Maggie.<br> I shouldn't have dropped my hands.<br> I shouldn't have turned.<br> Always protect myself.<br> How many times he tell me that?<br> Yeah...<br> ...he does like to repeat himself.<br> Will you tell him I'm real sorry?<br> No.<br> I won't do no such thing, Maggie.<br> Damnedest thing.<br> So, what's the plan?<br> I know you got one,<br> so you might as well tell me what it is.<br> It's your fault.<br> Yeah, it's your fault<br> she's lying in there like that.<br> You kept after me until I trained her.<br> I knew I shouldn't have done it,<br> her being a girl and all.<br> Everything kept telling me not to.<br> Everything but you.<br> I'm gonna get you out of here.<br> These doctors around here<br> don't know squat.<br> Otherwise, why would they be<br> living out here in the desert?<br> As soon as you're able to be moved...<br> ...we'll find some place where<br> they've actually studied medicine.<br> You just rest there, I'II...<br> I'm on it.<br> Frankie must have called<br> every hospital in America...<br> ... looking for somebody<br> who'd tell him they could fix her.<br> He came close twice,<br> till they checked her over...<br> ... said there was nothing to be done.<br> Took two months till she was<br> stable enough to move.<br> They got nurses for that, you know.<br> Yeah, but they're amateurs.<br> She developed skin ulcers<br> because she couldn't change positions.<br> Thank you.<br> They made the six-hour trip<br> by ambulance.<br> Fly there, drive back.<br> The rehab center Frankie found<br> was a nice place.<br> They took good care of Maggie.<br> She wouldn't have complained<br> if they hadn't.<br> Took several hours every day<br> to get her ready for the wheelchair.<br> One, two, three, up.<br> Since she couldn't breathe on her own...<br> ... her respirators were always on.<br> Oxygen was pumped into her<br> 24 hours a day.<br> Maggie's mama called to say<br> they were all coming for a visit.<br> She waited by the window<br> every day for the next two weeks.<br> Sure.<br> Frankie finally tracked them down.<br> Learned they'd checked into their hotel<br> six days earlier.<br> Kept leaving messages<br> which were never returned.<br> You don't have to hang around all day.<br> I like it here. I don't mind.<br> In fact, if you weren't here,<br> I'd come here anyway to read my books.<br> Mama will be here soon<br> to share some of the burden.<br> Well, it's no burden.<br> Here.<br> Read this.<br> Okay, okay, that's enough.<br> That's terrible.<br> Anyway, I'll tell you in English<br> what you were saying.<br> It says:<br> I will arise and go now<br> And go to Innisfree<br> And a small cabin build there<br> Of clay and wattles made<br> And I shall have some peace there<br> For peace comes dropping slow<br> Dropping from the veils of the morning<br> To where the cricket sings.<br> Not bad, huh?<br> You gonna build a cabin, boss?<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah.<br> You know, when you quit all this.<br> You mean boxing?<br> No, I'll never quit.<br> I like the stink too much, I guess.<br> You think?<br> Because I could see you there real easy...<br> ...with your books and lemon pie.<br> How about you?<br> Would you like to go live in a cabin?<br> I could learn how to bake.<br> Well, then, I'II...<br> Maybe I'll start looking then.<br> Yeah.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - All right. Okay, sounds good.<br> Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.<br> I met you back out in Missouri.<br> Where's my little girl?<br> Don't you think you ought to go back<br> to the hotel and change?<br> She doesn't know you've been here<br> a week visiting Woody and Mickey.<br> We got business with my sister.<br> Why don't you just tell us where she is.<br> Oh, you must be J.D.<br> And you must be the business guy?<br> There's some rides you missed.<br> Why don't you go back.<br> I'll tell her you couldn't make it.<br> I drove all the way here<br> to take care of my child.<br> And you're suggesting<br> I'm not a good mother?<br> Mary M. Can't go nowhere.<br> If we could've taken her to Disneyland,<br> we would've.<br> Margaret Fitzgerald?<br> Right down here, 301.<br> - Come on, Mama.<br> - Let's go.<br> And I saw myself breathing.<br> Like, my body was going up and down.<br> I thought,<br> "Why didn't somebody tell me?"<br> Your hair needs washing.<br> It's kind of greasy.<br> It's just a...<br> It's just some kind of legal thing.<br> What is it?<br> How we all doing here?<br> Sorry, darling,<br> but we ain't got a lot of time.<br> Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money<br> to be here to make sure this is done proper.<br> Why don't you just leave that.<br> I'll read it to her later.<br> Hey, old man...<br> ...you part of our family?<br> Stay the hell out of this.<br> Read it to me, Mama.<br> Well, it's just something legal<br> to protect your money.<br> Mama, you don't have to worry.<br> The boxing commission's<br> paying for all this, everything.<br> But what if they don't, Mary M?<br> Mr. Johnson says<br> they can take my house.<br> If you assign your assets to your mother,<br> no one can touch them.<br> No doctors, no funeral expenses.<br> - Nothing.<br> - Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.<br> - Then I'll just read it to her later on...<br> - With respect, this ain't your business.<br> All right. I'll be out in the hall.<br> You been a good daughter, Mary M.<br> You sign that paper...<br> ...it'll take care of your family...<br> ...the way your daddy<br> would've wanted you to.<br> How do you make your mark?<br> Can you hold a pen?<br> She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.<br> You gotta put it in her mouth.<br> Here you go, honey.<br> Did you see the fight, Mama?<br> Honey, you know how I feel about that.<br> I did pretty good.<br> You lost, Mary M.<br> Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,<br> but you lost.<br> Don't wanna lose the rest<br> of what you got left.<br> There you go.<br> What happened to you?<br> Well, what's that supposed to mean?<br> Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.<br> And get home.<br> Before I tell that lawyer that you were<br> so worried about your welfare...<br> ...you never signed those house papers<br> like you were supposed to.<br> So any time I feel like it,<br> I can sell that house...<br> ...from under your fat, lazy,<br> hillbilly asses.<br> And if you ever come back,<br> that's exactly what I'll do.<br> Well, maybe someone ought<br> to count to 10.<br> Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?<br> We might have to lose it, Maggie.<br> They took my leg, boss.<br> It's gonna be all right, you hear?<br> I always hear your voice, boss.<br> You need anything?<br> I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.<br> But you didn't win.<br> I don't have to tell you.<br> You're the meanest man I ever met.<br> No wonder no one loves you.<br> You remind me of my daddy.<br> Well, he must have been...<br> ...a very intelligent, handsome man.<br> You ain't gonna make me talk<br> no more Yeats, are you?<br> No, I was...<br> ...Iooking at this catalog<br> from City College.<br> I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...<br> ...maybe the kind that operates<br> by blowing through a straw.<br> I thought maybe you'd like<br> to go back to school.<br> I got a favor to ask you, boss.<br> Sure.<br> Anything you want.<br> Remember what my daddy did for Axel?<br> Don't even think about that.<br> I can't be like this, Frankie.<br> Not after what I done.<br> I seen the world.<br> People chanted my name.<br> Well...<br> ...not my name,<br> some damn name you gave me.<br> But they were chanting for me.<br> I was in magazines.<br> You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?<br> I was born at 2 pounds,<br> Daddy used to tell me<br> I fought to get into this world...<br> ...and I'd fight my way out.<br> That's all I wanna do, Frankie.<br> I just don't wanna fight you to do it.<br> I got what I needed.<br> I got it all.<br> Don't let them keep<br> taking it away from me.<br> Don't let me lie here till I can't hear<br> those people chanting no more.<br> I can't.<br> Please.<br> Please, don't ask me.<br> I'm asking.<br> I can't.<br> Hello?<br> In the middle of the night...<br> ... Maggie had found her own solution.<br> She had bit her tongue.<br> Stop. Stop.<br> Look at me. Look at me.<br> Nearly bled to death<br> before they stitched her up.<br> She came around and ripped them out<br> before Frankie even got there.<br> They stitched her up again...<br> ... padded the tongue<br> so she couldn't bite.<br> You can't do it, you know that.<br> I do, Father.<br> But you don't know how thick she is...<br> ...how hard it was to train her.<br> Other fighters would do<br> exactly what you'd say to them...<br> ...and she'd ask, why this and why that,<br> and then do it her own way anyway.<br> How she fought for the title, I...<br> It wasn't by anything...<br> Well, it wasn't by listening to me.<br> But now she wants to die...<br> ...and I just wanna keep her with me.<br> And I swear to God, Father, it's...<br> It's committing a sin by doing it.<br> By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> How do I get around that?<br> You don't. You step aside, Frankie.<br> You leave her with God.<br> She's not asking for God's help.<br> She's asking for mine.<br> Frankie, I've seen you at Mass<br> almost every day for 23 years.<br> The only person comes<br> to church that much...<br> ...is the kind who can't<br> forgive himself for something.<br> Whatever sins you're carrying...<br> ...they're nothing compared to this.<br> Forget about God or heaven and hell.<br> If you do this thing, you'll be lost.<br> Somewhere so deep...<br> ...you'll never find yourself again.<br> I think I did it already.<br> We're keeping her sedated<br> so she won't try that again.<br> I went to see Maggie this morning.<br> You must have been somewhere else.<br> Yeah.<br> You got a fight I don't know about?<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> I was wrong to say that.<br> You're damn right.<br> I found you a fighter...<br> ...and you made her<br> the best fighter she could be.<br> I killed her.<br> Don't say that.<br> Maggie walked through that door<br> with nothing but guts.<br> No chance in the world of being<br> what she needed to be.<br> A year and a half later, she's fighting<br> for the championship of the world.<br> You did that.<br> People die every day, Frankie.<br> Mopping floors, washing dishes.<br> And you know what<br> their last thought is?<br> "I never got my shot."<br> Because of you, Maggie got her shot.<br> If she dies today, you know what<br> her last thought will be?<br> "I think I did all right."<br> I know I could rest with that.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.<br> Yeah.<br> All right.<br> I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...<br> ...then you're gonna go to sleep.<br> Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...<br> ...stay asleep.<br> Mo cuishle...<br> ...means "my darling, my blood."<br> He gave her a single shot.<br> It was enough adrenaline<br> to do the job a few times over.<br> He didn't want her<br> going through this again.<br> Then he walked out.<br> I don't think he had anything left.<br> I went back to the gym.<br> Waited, figuring he'd turn up<br> sooner or later.<br> And that's when a ghost<br> came through the door.<br> I got to thinking what you said,<br> Mr. Scrap.<br> What was that, Danger?<br> Anybody can lose one fight.<br> That's the truth.<br> Go on, put your gloves on.<br> You missed a lot of training.<br> Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.<br> Frankie never came back at all.<br> Frankie didn't leave a note,<br> and nobody knew where he went.<br> I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...<br> ... and ask you one more time<br> to forgive him.<br> But maybe he didn't have<br> anything left in his heart.<br> I just hope he found someplace<br> where he could find a little peace.<br> A place set in the cedars and oak trees.<br> Somewhere between<br> nowhere and goodbye.<br> But that's probably wishful thinking.<br> No matter where he is...<br> ... I thought you should know what kind<br> of man your father really was.<br>
