                        You've got them mixed up.<br> You're making a mistake.<br> You're making a mistake<br> with the reindeer.<br> Tsk tsk tsk.<br> Would you mind stepping out<br> for a moment?<br> Open the door!<br> I'm sorry.<br> The store isn't open today.<br> I don't want<br> to buy anything...<br> and I'm sorry<br> to interrupt your work...<br> but I wanted to tell you<br> you're making a serious mistake.<br> - Huh?<br> - With the reindeer, I mean.<br> You've got Cupid<br> where Blitzen should be.<br> And Dasher should be<br> on my right-hand side.<br> He should, huh?<br> Yes. And another thing...<br> Donner's antlers have got<br> four points instead of three.<br> Still, I don't suppose anybody<br> would notice except myself.<br> No. I don't suppose so.<br> - Well, bye. Thanks.<br> - Not at all.<br> Glad to have helped you. Bye.<br> Yes.<br> Jingle bells,<br> jingle bells...<br> You're on float number three.<br> You're on the Pilgrim float.<br> You're on the pirate float.<br> You follow the van.<br> Mrs. Walker,<br> something's got to be done.<br> That three-men-in-a-tub float<br> isn't big enough.<br> We can get<br> the butcher and the baker...<br> I'm awfully sorry...<br> but I've got enough to do<br> to take care of the people.<br> I was hoping you could... George!<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> You seem to have got mixed up<br> with this whip of yours.<br> Allow me, will you?<br> It's quite simple, really.<br> - You don't mind if I show you?<br> - No, sir.<br> Now, then.<br> - See? It's all in the wrist.<br> - Is that so?<br> Yes, of course.<br> If you follow through.<br> Is that so?<br> It's just like<br> throwing a ball.<br> If you were to...<br> You've been drinking.<br> Well, it's cold.<br> A man's got to do something<br> to keep warm.<br> You ought<br> to be ashamed of yourself.<br> Don't you realize there are<br> thousands of children...<br> lining the streets<br> waiting to see you...<br> children who have been dreaming<br> of this moment for weeks?<br> You're a disgrace to<br> the tradition of Christmas...<br> and I refuse to have you<br> malign me in this fashion.<br> Disgusting.<br> Tell me, who's in charge<br> of this parade?<br> When you find out, tell me.<br> These pants are gonna fall off<br> in Columbus Circle.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Who's in charge here?<br> Mrs. Walker.<br> There she is, down there.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> You two ought to be<br> over on 81st Street.<br> Mrs. Walker,<br> one of the men in your parade...<br> What are you doing<br> out of costume?<br> Get back and get dressed...<br> Oh, I'm terribly sorry.<br> I thought<br> you were our Santa Claus.<br> Your Santa Claus<br> is intoxicated.<br> - Oh, no!<br> - Yes. It's disgraceful.<br> How can you allow a man<br> to get into such a position?<br> Jingle bells, jingle bells...<br> Stop that!<br> What do you mean by drinking?<br> You know it's not allowed.<br> A man's got to do<br> something to keep warm.<br> I'll warm you.<br> I ought to take this cane...<br> Somebody, Julian,<br> get some black coffee...<br> plenty of it, too.<br> Yes, Mrs. Walker.<br> Black with a little cream.<br> Wake me up<br> when the parade starts.<br> Jingle bells, jingle bells<br> Jingle all the way<br> Shameful! Absolutely shameful!<br> Could you be Santa Claus?<br> Have you had any experience?<br> Oh, a little.<br> Oh, please.<br> You've got to help me out.<br> I am not in the habit<br> of substituting...<br> for spurious Santa Clauses.<br> - Oh, please.<br> - No, I...<br> Well, the children<br> mustn't be disappointed.<br> All right, I'll do it.<br> Oh, good. Thank you.<br> Come right this way.<br> Get that costume.<br> Wonderful!<br> He's the best we've ever had...<br> and he didn't need any padding.<br> What?<br> He didn't need padding.<br> Where did you find him?<br> I just turned round,<br> and there he was.<br> I'm glad you turned round.<br> Just think if Mr. Macy<br> had seen the other one!<br> Just think if Mr. Gimbel<br> had seen the other one.<br> You want to ride<br> in the motorcycle or a car?<br> No. I'm going home<br> and get in a hot tub...<br> and I might stay there<br> until next Thanksgiving.<br> You should see it.<br> You worked so hard.<br> If I want to, which I doubt...<br> I can see it from<br> the roof of my apartment.<br> That's right,<br> you live down the...<br> Mrs. Walker!<br> Susan!<br> Susan?<br> - Hello, Cleo.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Walker.<br> What a beauty.<br> Where's Susan?<br> She's watching the parade.<br> Where? With whom?<br> With that Mr. Gailey<br> in the front apartment.<br> Oh, yes.<br> I've been keeping<br> an eye on her.<br> She can see everything<br> from there.<br> That's the 50 yard line.<br> He's so very fond of Susan.<br> When he asked me,<br> I didn't think you'd mind.<br> Well, I guess it's all right.<br> I'll go on in a minute.<br> Looks like they're<br> having a little trouble...<br> with the baseball player.<br> He was a clown last year.<br> They just changed the head<br> and painted him different.<br> My mother told me.<br> He certainly is a giant,<br> isn't he?<br> Not really.<br> There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.<br> Maybe not now, Suzie...<br> but in olden days,<br> there were a lot of...<br> What about the giant<br> that Jack killed?<br> Jack? Jack who?<br> Jack...<br> Jack!<br> "Jack and the Beanstalk."<br> I never heard of that.<br> You must've heard that.<br> You've just forgotten.<br> It's a fairy tale.<br> Oh, one of those.<br> I don't know any.<br> Your mother and father<br> must have told you a fairy tale.<br> No. My mother thinks<br> they're silly.<br> I don't know whether my father<br> thinks they're silly or not.<br> I never met my father.<br> My father and mother were<br> divorced when I was a baby.<br> Well, that baseball player<br> looks like a giant to me.<br> People sometimes grow very big,<br> but that's abnormal.<br> I'll bet your mother<br> told you that, too.<br> Hello.<br> I'm Susan's mother.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Won't you come in?<br> Suzie's told me quite a lot<br> about you. I'm Fred Gailey.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Susan's told me quite<br> a lot about you, too.<br> - Hello, Mother!<br> - Hello, dear.<br> A cup of coffee?<br> You must be half frozen.<br> - Oh, don't bother.<br> - It's all ready.<br> In that case, thanks.<br> What do you think of my parade?<br> It's much better<br> than last year's.<br> Well, I hope<br> Mr. Macy agrees with you.<br> Sugar? Cream?<br> Both? Neither?<br> Just one sugar, please.<br> This is very kind of you,<br> Mr. Gailey.<br> Sit down.<br> I want to thank you<br> for being so kind to Susan.<br> Cleo tells me you took them<br> to the zoo yesterday.<br> That's right,<br> but I must confess.<br> It's part of a deep-dyed plot.<br> I'm fond of Suzie, very fond,<br> but I also wanted to meet you.<br> I read someplace the surest way<br> to meet the mother...<br> is to be kind to the child.<br> What a horrible trick.<br> It worked.<br> There goes Santa Claus.<br> Oh, don't even<br> mention the name.<br> He's much better<br> than last year's.<br> At least this one<br> doesn't wear glasses.<br> This one was<br> a last-minute substitute.<br> The one I hired I fired.<br> Why?<br> You remember<br> the janitor last New Year's?<br> Ohh, yes.<br> Well,<br> this one was much worse.<br> Oh.<br> I see she doesn't<br> believe in Santa Claus, either.<br> No Santa Claus,<br> no fairy tales...<br> no fantasies of any kind,<br> is that it?<br> That's right.<br> We should be realistic...<br> and completely truthful<br> with our children...<br> and not have them growing up<br> believing in...<br> a lot of legends and myths<br> like Santa Claus, for example.<br> I see.<br> That's the end.<br> The acrobats were good.<br> They ought to be<br> at those prices.<br> Thanks for the coffee.<br> And thank you<br> for inviting me in.<br> It was a pleasure, missy.<br> Mother, I was thinking...<br> we've got such<br> a big turkey for dinner...<br> and there are only two of us.<br> Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey?<br> Oh, don't even<br> think about it.<br> I'll have a sandwich<br> or something.<br> It's an awful big turkey.<br> That's not it, dear...<br> but I'm sure Mr. Gailey<br> has other plans.<br> No, he hasn't. Have you?<br> To be quite honest<br> and truthful with the child...<br> I must admit<br> I haven't any other plans.<br> Please, Mother!<br> Did I ask all right?<br> Hmm?<br> Didn't I ask all right,<br> Mr. Gailey?<br> That all depends.<br> Dinner's at 3:00.<br> Thanks.<br> Suzie, honey,<br> you asked just right.<br> I'll see you at 3:00.<br> - It worked.<br> - Yes.<br> I tell you,<br> Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.<br> Everybody's crazy about him.<br> So is Mr. Macy.<br> Well, hire him,<br> by all means.<br> It's perfectly<br> all right with me.<br> It'll save me a frantic search<br> in the morning.<br> Yes. That's right.<br> I'll take care of it as soon<br> as he gets through.<br> You'll love him.<br> I just know that<br> with that man on the throne...<br> my department will sell<br> more toys than it ever has.<br> He's a born salesman.<br> I just feel it.<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> We'll talk about it<br> in the morning. Good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> And you'll find toys<br> of all kinds at Macy's.<br> Gee, that sure is<br> an elegant costume.<br> Yes. I've had it<br> for years and years.<br> Sure makes a bum<br> out of the one they gave you.<br> Even that one's better<br> than the one I wear.<br> You, Alfred?<br> I play Santa Claus<br> over at the "Y" near our block.<br> No kidding!<br> Started about three years ago.<br> They had a costume,<br> but it didn't have no padding...<br> and since I carry my own<br> padding around with me...<br> I got the job, see?<br> You enjoy impersonating me?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know. It's...<br> When I give packages<br> to little kids...<br> I like to watch<br> their faces get that...<br> that Christmas look<br> all of a sudden.<br> It makes me feel<br> kind of good and important.<br> Pardon me!<br> I bought<br> a 23-pound turkey.<br> I had my daughter and her kids<br> over for dinner yesterday.<br> There you are.<br> Good morning.<br> Oh, my,<br> what a striking costume!<br> Before you go up on the floor,<br> I want to give you...<br> a few tips on how to be<br> a good Santa Claus.<br> Go right ahead.<br> Here's a list<br> of toys that we have to push.<br> You know, things<br> that we're overstocked on.<br> Now, you'll find<br> that a great many children...<br> will be undecided as to what<br> they want for Christmas.<br> When that happens,<br> you suggest one of these items.<br> You understand?<br> I certainly do.<br> Good.<br> You memorize that list...<br> Oh, no. 9:50.<br> When you've finished,<br> come up to the seventh floor.<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> Imagine...<br> making a child take something<br> it doesn't want...<br> just because he bought<br> too many of the wrong toys.<br> That's what I've been<br> fighting against for years...<br> the way they<br> commercialize Christmas.<br> A lot of bad "isms"<br> floating around this world...<br> but one of the worst<br> is commercialism.<br> Make a buck. Make a buck.<br> Even in Brooklyn,<br> it's the same.<br> Don't care what Christmas<br> stands for.<br> Just make a buck.<br> Oh, don't bother.<br> I'll put it away for you.<br> Eh?<br> Oh, thank you, Alfred.<br> And what should I do<br> with these?<br> Throw them on the floor.<br> I get kind of tired<br> just sweeping up dust.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Well, thank you, Alfred.<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> Peter's a fine name.<br> What do you want<br> for Christmas, Peter?<br> A fire engine, just like<br> the big ones only smaller...<br> that has a real hose<br> that squirts real water.<br> I won't do it in the house,<br> only in the backyard.<br> I promise.<br> Psst! Psst!<br> Macy's ain't got any.<br> Nobody's got any.<br> Well, Peter,<br> I can tell you're a good boy.<br> You'll get your fire engine.<br> Oh, thank you very much!<br> You see?<br> I told you he'd get me one.<br> That's fine.<br> That's just dandy.<br> Listen, you wait over there.<br> Mama wants to thank<br> Santa Claus, too.<br> Say, listen,<br> what's the matter with you?<br> Don't you understand English?<br> I tell you nobody's got any.<br> I've been all over.<br> My feet are killing me.<br> A fine thing, promising the kid.<br> You don't think I would've<br> said that unless I'm sure?<br> You can get those fire engines<br> at Schoenfeld's on Lexington.<br> Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.<br> Schoenfeld's?<br> I don't get it.<br> I keep track of<br> the toy market pretty closely.<br> Does that surprise you so?<br> Surprise me?<br> Macy's sending people<br> to other stores?<br> Are you kidding me?<br> The only important thing<br> is to make the children happy.<br> Who sells the toy<br> doesn't make any difference.<br> Don't you feel that way?<br> Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.<br> Only I didn't know Macy's did.<br> As long as I'm here, they do.<br> I don't get it.<br> No, I just don't get it.<br> I quite understand.<br> Your little girl<br> would like some skates.<br> But of course,<br> you must get her the best...<br> 'cause their little ankles<br> want protecting.<br> Our skates are very good,<br> but not quite good enough.<br> You go to Gimbels.<br> They'll have exactly what<br> you're looking for.<br> There you are, dear.<br> That's for you.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Gimbels.<br> Hello, my little girl.<br> How old are you?<br> Gimbels.<br> Gimbels!<br> Pardon me.<br> The guard said to speak to you.<br> You're the head<br> of the toy department?<br> Yes, madam...<br> Listen. I want to<br> congratulate you and Macy's...<br> on this wonderful new stunt<br> you're pulling.<br> Imagine, sending people<br> to other stores.<br> I don't get it. Why, it's...<br> - It certainly is.<br> - You said it.<br> Imagine a big outfit<br> like Macy's...<br> putting the spirit of Christmas<br> ahead of the commercial.<br> It's wonderful.<br> I never done<br> much shopping here before...<br> but from now on, I'm going<br> to be a regular Macy customer.<br> All right, dear.<br> Thank you, madam.<br> There are six more<br> women who want to thank you.<br> Not now. I've got<br> to think this thing over.<br> Personally, I think<br> it's a wonderful idea, too.<br> You think so.<br> Those women think so.<br> The point is,<br> will Mr. Macy think so?<br> This seems awfully silly,<br> Mr. Gailey.<br> I thought as long<br> as we're in the store...<br> you might as well<br> say hello to Santa Claus.<br> Why?<br> Because when<br> you talk to him...<br> you might feel<br> differently about him.<br> Good-bye, Elmer.<br> Be a good boy now.<br> Merry Christmas!<br> Well, young lady,<br> what's your name?<br> Susan Walker.<br> What's yours?<br> Mine? Kris Kringle.<br> I'm Santa Claus.<br> Oh, you don't believe that,<br> do you?<br> My mother's Mrs. Walker,<br> the lady who hired you.<br> Oh.<br> But I must say,<br> you're the best one I've seen.<br> Really?<br> Your beard doesn't have<br> those things over your ears.<br> That's because it's real,<br> like I'm really Santa Claus.<br> Oh, go ahead, pull it.<br> Ouch.<br> All right, folks,<br> don't crowd.<br> You have all day<br> to see Santa Claus.<br> Now, children, behave.<br> This way, please.<br> Get back in the line there.<br> What would you like me<br> to bring you for Christmas?<br> Nothing, thank you.<br> Oh, come now.<br> You must want something.<br> Whatever I want,<br> my mother will get for me...<br> if it's sensible and doesn't<br> cost too much, of course.<br> Hello, Mother.<br> Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.<br> I think you've taken up enough<br> of this gentleman's time.<br> The explanation for this<br> is all very simple.<br> Cleo's mother<br> sprained her ankle.<br> She had to go home and asked me<br> to bring Suzie down to you.<br> Yes, Cleo called me.<br> I was wondering where you were.<br> As long as we're here,<br> we should say hello to Santa.<br> He's a nice old man,<br> and those whiskers are real.<br> Yes, dear. Many men<br> have long beards like that.<br> Susan, would you stand<br> over here a minute?<br> I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.<br> I shouldn't have brought<br> Suzie to see Santa Claus?<br> You're making me feel<br> like the proverbial stepmother.<br> I'm sorry, but I just<br> couldn't see any harm...<br> in just saying hello<br> to the old fellow.<br> But I think there is harm.<br> I tell her Santa Claus is<br> a myth, you bring her here...<br> and she sees hundreds<br> of gullible children...<br> meets a very convincing<br> old man with real whiskers.<br> This sets up a very harmful<br> mental conflict within her.<br> What is she going to think?<br> Who is she going to believe?<br> And by filling them<br> full of fairy tales...<br> they grow up considering life<br> a fantasy instead of a reality.<br> They keep waiting for<br> Prince Charming to come along.<br> And when he does,<br> he turns out to be a...<br> We were talking<br> about Suzie, not about you.<br> Whether you agree or not...<br> I must ask you to respect<br> my wishes regarding Susan.<br> She's my responsibility...<br> and I must bring her up<br> as I see fit.<br> OK.<br> - Say "Thank you."<br> - Thank you.<br> Bye. Merry Christmas!<br> Well, young lady,<br> what's your name?<br> I'm sorry.<br> She doesn't speak English.<br> She's Dutch. She just came over.<br> She's been living<br> in an orphans home...<br> in Rotterdam ever since...<br> We've adopted her.<br> I told her you wouldn't<br> be able to speak to her...<br> but when she saw you<br> in the parade yesterday...<br> she said you were<br> "Sinter Claes"...<br> and you could talk to her.<br> I didn't know what to do.<br> Hello.<br> Now do you understand?<br> Yes, I see what<br> you mean, Mother.<br> Good.<br> But when he spoke Dutch<br> to that girl, he was so...<br> Susan, I speak French,<br> but I'm not Joan of Arc.<br> What I'm trying<br> to explain is... Come in.<br> They said you wanted<br> to see me, Mrs. Walker.<br> Come right in.<br> Hello there!<br> Good to see you again.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> You're awfully lucky,<br> Mrs. Walker.<br> Lovely little girl<br> you have here.<br> Thank you. Susan's why<br> I asked you to drop down.<br> She's a little confused...<br> and I thought you could help<br> straighten her out.<br> Oh, glad to.<br> Would you please tell her<br> you're not really Santa Claus...<br> that there actually<br> is no such person?<br> I'm sorry to disagree<br> with you, Mrs. Walker.<br> Not only is there such a person,<br> but here I am to prove it.<br> No, you misunderstand.<br> I want you to tell her<br> the truth. What's your name?<br> Kris Kringle. I'll bet<br> you're in the first grade.<br> Second.<br> I mean your real name.<br> That is my real name.<br> Second grade?<br> It's a progressive school.<br> Oh,<br> it's a progressive school.<br> May I have this man's<br> employment card, please?<br> Yes, Mrs. Walker.<br> This dress is very cute.<br> Where did you get<br> such a lovely outfit?<br> Here at Macy's.<br> We get 10% off.<br> Please don't feel<br> you have to pretend for Susan.<br> She's a very<br> intelligent child...<br> and always wants to know<br> the absolute truth.<br> Good, because I always<br> tell the absolute truth.<br> About your school...<br> What's the name of your teacher?<br> Mrs. Haley.<br> - Here it is, Mrs. Walker.<br> - Thank you.<br> What else do you do<br> besides read and play games?<br> We have rest periods<br> for one half-hour.<br> I don't suppose<br> you care for that, eh?<br> No. We're not allowed<br> to talk or anything.<br> Tuesday, Chester Richards<br> kept talking all the time.<br> My, that was bad, eh?<br> Mrs. Haley made him rest<br> all alone for nearly an hour.<br> Susan, would you go out<br> and talk to Miss Adams?<br> I'll be right with you.<br> All right. Good-bye.<br> Good-bye, young lady.<br> Hope to see you again.<br> Thank you.<br> I hope so, too. Bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...<br> Kringle.<br> I'm sorry, but we're<br> going to have to make a change.<br> Change?<br> The Santa Claus<br> that we had two years ago...<br> is back in town,<br> and I feel we owe it to him...<br> Have I done something wrong?<br> Oh, no, no.<br> Well...<br> Yes?<br> Mr. Macy wants<br> to see you immediately.<br> I'll be right up.<br> Would you sit down...<br> and I'll be right back<br> and sign your pay voucher.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Go right in.<br> Mr. Macy's waiting.<br> The effect this will<br> have on the public is...<br> Come in, Mrs. Walker.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Walker.<br> - Sit over here.<br> I've been telling these<br> gentlemen the new policy...<br> you and Mr. Shellhammer<br> initiated.<br> I can't say that I approve<br> of your not consulting...<br> the advertising department<br> first...<br> but in the face of this<br> tremendous public response...<br> I can't be angry with you.<br> - What's he talking about?<br> - Tell you later.<br> Now, to continue, gentlemen.<br> I admit this plan sounds<br> idiotic and impossible.<br> Imagine Macy's Santa Claus<br> sending customers to Gimbels.<br> Ho ho. But, gentlemen,<br> you cannot argue with success.<br> Look at this.<br> Telegrams,<br> messages, telephone calls.<br> The governor's wife,<br> the mayor's wife...<br> over 500 thankful parents...<br> expressing<br> undying gratitude to Macy's.<br> Never in my entire career...<br> have I seen such a tremendous<br> and immediate response...<br> to a merchandising policy.<br> And I'm positive, Frank,<br> if we expand our policy...<br> we'll expand<br> our results as well.<br> Therefore, from now on...<br> not only will our Santa Claus<br> continue in this manner...<br> but I want every salesperson<br> in this store...<br> to do precisely the same thing.<br> If we haven't got exactly<br> what the customer wants...<br> we'll send him<br> where he can get it.<br> No high pressuring<br> and forcing a customer...<br> to take something<br> he doesn't really want.<br> We'll be known<br> as the helpful store...<br> the friendly store,<br> the store with a heart...<br> the store that places<br> public service ahead of profits.<br> And, consequently, we'll make<br> more profits than ever before.<br> Yes, I know it's late,<br> and we're all tired...<br> and we want to go to dinner...<br> so we'll continue first thing<br> in the morning.<br> In the meantime,<br> you fellas get together...<br> and figure out the best way<br> to promote this thing.<br> We'll do that. Good night, R.H.<br> Good night.<br> I want to thank you two again.<br> And in your<br> Christmas envelopes...<br> you'll find a more practical<br> expression of my gratitude.<br> Thank you, Mr. Macy.<br> Tell that Santa<br> I won't forget him, either.<br> Yes, Mr. Macy.<br> Imagine, a bonus!<br> He just assumed it was our idea.<br> What's the matter?<br> - I fired him.<br> - Who?<br> - Santa Claus.<br> - What?<br> He's crazy.<br> He thinks he is Santa Claus.<br> I don't care if<br> he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.<br> Get him back.<br> He's insane, I tell you.<br> We'll hire somebody else<br> and have him do the same thing.<br> You heard Mr. Macy.<br> We've got to keep him.<br> What if he should have<br> a sudden fit?<br> Oh, no.<br> I've got to tell Mr. Macy.<br> But maybe<br> he's only a little crazy...<br> like painters or composers...<br> or some of those men<br> in Washington.<br> We can't be sure<br> until he's been examined.<br> If you fire him, and we find out<br> he wasn't really crazy...<br> Mr. Macy will have us<br> examined and fired.<br> I suppose<br> we ought to be sure.<br> We could if Mr. Sawyer<br> talked to him.<br> Of course.<br> He's a psychologist.<br> He's paid to examine employees.<br> Until we get his report,<br> we won't say a word.<br> I'll get in touch<br> with him right away.<br> First,<br> get that Santa Claus back!<br> The examination is worthless<br> without the patient.<br> It was just because<br> I felt we owed it to him...<br> but Mr. Macy suggested<br> that we find something else...<br> for the other Santa Claus<br> and keep you on by all means.<br> Oh, well, thanks.<br> That's mighty good news.<br> You'll be here<br> in the morning then?<br> Certainly I will.<br> Mrs. Walker, this is<br> quite an opportunity for me.<br> For the past 50 years or so...<br> I've been getting more<br> worried about Christmas.<br> Seems we're all so busy trying<br> to beat the other fellow...<br> in making things go faster,<br> look shinier, and cost less...<br> that Christmas and I are sort of<br> getting lost in the shuffle.<br> I don't think so.<br> Christmas is still Christmas.<br> Christmas isn't just a day.<br> It's a frame of mind.<br> That's what's been changing.<br> That's why I'm glad I'm here.<br> Maybe I can do something.<br> And I'm glad<br> I met you and your daughter.<br> You two are a test case for me.<br> We are?<br> Yes. You're sort of<br> the whole thing in miniature.<br> If I can win you over,<br> there's still hope.<br> If not,<br> then I guess I'm through.<br> But I'm warning you,<br> I don't give up easily.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Oh, Mr. Kringle,<br> first thing in the morning...<br> would you report<br> to Mr. Sawyer's office?<br> He'll give you<br> a little examination.<br> Oh, we do it<br> with all our employees.<br> A mental examination?<br> Well...<br> I don't mind.<br> I've taken dozens of them.<br> Never failed one yet.<br> Know them by heart.<br> - How many days in the week?<br> - Seven.<br> - How many fingers do you see?<br> - Four.<br> Muscular coordination test.<br> No damage<br> to the nervous system.<br> Who was the first president<br> of the United States?<br> George Washington.<br> Who was vice president<br> under John Quincy Adams?<br> Daniel D. Tompkins.<br> I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer<br> doesn't know that.<br> Good night.<br> Miss Adams, would you get me...<br> the Brooks' Memorial Home<br> in Great Neck?<br> It's a home for old people.<br> That's right.<br> I want to talk<br> to the doctor in charge.<br> - How many days in the week?<br> - Seven.<br> The first president<br> of the United States?<br> George Washington.<br> Three times five?<br> You asked me that before.<br> The answer's at the bottom...<br> I'm conducting this examination.<br> How much is three times five?<br> Same as before... 15.<br> You're rather nervous,<br> aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?<br> Do you get enough sleep?<br> My personal habits<br> are of no concern to you.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I hate to see someone tied up...<br> - How many fingers do you see?<br> - Three.<br> You bite your nails, too.<br> Tsk tsk tsk.<br> I want you to stand<br> with your feet together...<br> and your arms extended.<br> Then I want you to...<br> Muscular coordination test?<br> Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.<br> Sometimes the cause<br> of nervous habits like yours...<br> is not obvious. No.<br> Often they're the result<br> of an insecurity.<br> Are you happy at home?<br> That will be all!<br> The examination's over.<br> You may go.<br> Thank you.<br> You may go out that way.<br> And it may<br> interest you to know...<br> that I've been happily<br> married for 26 years.<br> Really? Delighted to hear it.<br> Good-bye.<br> Get me Mrs. Walker.<br> Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.<br> She says it's very important.<br> How many times have I told you<br> not to bother me at the office?<br> No. Not a penny.<br> I give you a liberal allowance.<br> It's up to you<br> to run the house on it.<br> If your stupid brother<br> would get a job...<br> you wouldn't have to<br> pester me all the time.<br> Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk<br> to you about this Kringle.<br> Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce<br> from the Brooks' home is here.<br> It would be a good time<br> to settle the matter.<br> Sorry, Doctor,<br> but that was Mr. Sawyer...<br> the gentleman<br> I was telling you about.<br> He's just down the hall.<br> I can't tell you how<br> we appreciate your time.<br> Matter of fact,<br> I was going to call you today.<br> I had a feeling about now<br> you'd be wondering about Kris.<br> Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.<br> How do you do?<br> After giving this man<br> a comprehensive examination...<br> it's my opinion he should<br> be dismissed immediately.<br> Really? He failed<br> to pass the examination?<br> - Yes.<br> - He didn't answer correctly?<br> Yes, he did,<br> but he lacked concentration.<br> He kept changing the subject.<br> Even questioned me.<br> I don't think<br> there's any doubt about it.<br> He should be placed<br> in a mental institution.<br> I don't agree.<br> People are institutionalized...<br> to prevent them from<br> harming themselves or others.<br> Mr. Kringle<br> is incapable of either.<br> His is a delusion for good.<br> He only wants<br> to be friendly and helpful.<br> That's what I feel, too.<br> Thousands of people<br> have similar delusions...<br> living perfectly normal lives<br> in every other respect.<br> A famous example<br> is that fellow...<br> I can't think of his name.<br> For years, he's insisted<br> he's a Russian prince.<br> There's been much evidence<br> to prove him wrong...<br> but nothing<br> has shaken his story.<br> Is he in an institution?<br> No. He owns a famous restaurant<br> in Hollywood...<br> and is a highly<br> respected citizen.<br> I've made a great study<br> of abnormal psychology...<br> and I've found from experience<br> when a delusion is challenged...<br> the deluded<br> is apt to become violent.<br> I'll have to disagree<br> with you again.<br> If you tell Kris<br> there is no Santa Claus...<br> I grant he'll argue the point,<br> but he'll not become violent.<br> His whole manner<br> suggests aggressiveness!<br> Look how he carries that cane!<br> He's never without it.<br> I know Kris<br> always carries a cane...<br> but surely you're not implying<br> he'd use the cane as a weapon?<br> Mrs. Walker, naturally<br> I can't discharge this man.<br> That's up to you.<br> But you asked my opinion.<br> So when he exhibits his latent<br> maniacal tendencies...<br> which I assure you he will...<br> please realize<br> the responsibility is yours.<br> Speaking of delusions...<br> Now we're right back<br> where we started.<br> No, we're not.<br> After listening to Dr. Pierce,<br> I feel perfectly confident.<br> But if anything happens,<br> you won't get blamed. I will.<br> Nothing's going to happen.<br> Please don't feel what I've said<br> was prompted by affection.<br> My specialty is geriatrics.<br> Huh?<br> Treatment<br> of the diseases of old age.<br> I've had quite a bit<br> of experience...<br> and I assure you Kris has<br> no latent maniacal tendencies.<br> You'll want to discuss this<br> with Mr. Shellhammer...<br> so I'll be on my way.<br> May I see Kris?<br> Why, certainly, Doctor.<br> Use the employees' elevator.<br> It's much quicker.<br> The same one you came up on.<br> - Where is that?<br> - I'll show you.<br> That isn't necessary.<br> I'll find my way.<br> You understand<br> my position, Doctor.<br> If there's the slightest<br> possibility...<br> of him becoming violent<br> or getting into trouble...<br> What trouble could he get into?<br> All that's got to happen<br> is a policeman to ask his name.<br> A big argument.<br> Clang, clang! Bellevue!<br> You can prevent that<br> very simply.<br> If he could<br> stay with an employee...<br> they could ride<br> to and from work together.<br> I'd prefer he didn't take the<br> train to Great Neck twice a day.<br> That would solve everything.<br> They could steer him away<br> from trouble.<br> Sort of take custody of him.<br> Do you think<br> he'd agree to that?<br> I'll talk to him.<br> I'm sure he will.<br> In that case, he can stay.<br> Good. Thank you.<br> It's the seventh floor,<br> and thank you very much.<br> - Bye, Doctor.<br> - Bye.<br> I'm sure<br> you made a wise decision.<br> Now, let's see...<br> who could rent him a room?<br> You.<br> Your son's away at school.<br> What about his room?<br> Well, I don't mind.<br> I'd be glad to.<br> I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer<br> wouldn't like it.<br> She's a little...<br> Say, I have an idea.<br> We always have martinis<br> before dinner.<br> I'll make them<br> double-strength tonight.<br> I'll bet after a couple of them,<br> she'll be more receptive.<br> But Kris is through work<br> at 6:00.<br> What about<br> the in-between time?<br> Take him home to dinner.<br> I'll call soon as my wife's<br> plastered... feeling gay.<br> Oh, no.<br> If I'm willing<br> to let my wife...<br> have a big headache<br> in the morning...<br> you can have<br> a little headache tonight.<br> All right.<br> Won't take an hour.<br> Everything will be OK.<br> Good. Very good.<br> What sort of games do you play<br> with the other children?<br> I don't play much with them.<br> They play silly games.<br> They do?<br> Like today. They were<br> in the basement playing zoo...<br> and all of them were animals.<br> When I came down, Homer...<br> he was the zookeeper...<br> he said, "What animal are you?"<br> I said,<br> "I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."<br> And he said,<br> "Only animals allowed."<br> So I came upstairs.<br> Why didn't you tell him<br> you were a lion or a bear?<br> Because<br> I'm not a bear or a lion.<br> But the other children<br> were only children...<br> and they were pretending<br> to be animals.<br> That's what makes<br> the game so silly.<br> I don't think so.<br> Sounds like<br> a wonderful game to me.<br> Of course, in order to play it,<br> you need an imagination.<br> Do you know<br> what the imagination is?<br> Oh, sure.<br> That's when you see things,<br> but they're not really there.<br> That can be caused<br> by other things, too.<br> No, to me the imagination<br> is a place all by itself...<br> a separate country.<br> You've heard of the French<br> or the British nation.<br> Well, this is<br> the Imagine nation.<br> It's a wonderful place.<br> How would you like to make<br> snowballs in the summertime?<br> Or drive a big bus<br> right down 5th Avenue?<br> How would you like to have<br> a ship all to yourself...<br> that makes daily trips<br> to China and Australia?<br> How would you like to be<br> the Statue of Liberty...<br> in the morning,<br> and in the afternoon...<br> fly south with a flock of geese?<br> It's very simple.<br> Of course, it takes practice.<br> The first thing you've got<br> to learn is how to pretend.<br> And the next time Homer says,<br> "What kind of animal are you?"<br> Tell him you're a monkey.<br> I don't know how to be a monkey.<br> Sure you do.<br> Here, I'll show you.<br> Now just bend<br> your body over a little.<br> Let your arms hang loose, see?<br> Now put your right hand<br> up here... under here.<br> Now scratch yourself, see?<br> That's right.<br> Put your tongue under your lips,<br> over your teeth.<br> - Like this?<br> - That's right.<br> Now scratch yourself<br> and chatter, see?<br> - Bla bla bla!<br> - Eeek!<br> Eeek erp!<br> Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,<br> Mackenzie, and Haislip...<br> have been very kind to me.<br> But being an exceptional lawyer,<br> I want to open my own office.<br> Put this in<br> Susan's place for me, please.<br> Take the meat out.<br> It should be done.<br> Don't forget to scratch.<br> Put your tongue up<br> in front of your teeth.<br> Talk to the other monkeys.<br> What's going on here?<br> We're having<br> our first lesson in pretending.<br> Doing quite well at it, too.<br> That's right.<br> Call the other monkeys.<br> No. You mustn't be a goose.<br> Be a monkey.<br> - Mr. Kringle...<br> - Yes?<br> Mrs. Walker<br> just happened to mention...<br> that they're looking<br> for a room for you.<br> That's right.<br> Dr. Pierce doesn't want me<br> making the long trip daily.<br> I was just thinking.<br> I'm all alone in my apartment.<br> Twin beds, plenty of room.<br> If you'd like<br> to move in with me...<br> I'd be only too happy<br> to have you.<br> That's awfully nice of you.<br> You could ride to and from<br> work with Mrs. Walker.<br> Yes. That would<br> give me a chance...<br> to really talk things<br> over with her.<br> Don't forget to scratch.<br> You're not scratching.<br> Besides, I could see<br> Suzie now and then.<br> Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.<br> Good!<br> We'll get your things<br> after dinner.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, yes, just a moment.<br> It's a Mr. Shellhammer.<br> Thanks.<br> Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.<br> Yes. Just a moment.<br> Mrs. Shellhammer<br> wants to talk to you.<br> I made the martinis<br> triple-strength...<br> and she feels wonderful.<br> Here, my pet.<br> Ha ha.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> No, no. No, dear.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> Hello?<br> No, no, dear. There.<br> Oh, darling, how silly of me!<br> Hello!<br> We'd love to have Santa Claus<br> come and stay with us.<br> I think it would be<br> simply charming.<br> Oh, and so do I,<br> Mrs. Shellhammer.<br> Just a moment.<br> It's Mrs. Shellhammer.<br> They have the loveliest room.<br> They'd be so happy<br> if you'd stay with them.<br> That's very sweet of them.<br> Please thank them very much...<br> but I'm going to stay<br> with Mr. Gailey.<br> Mr. Gailey.<br> I think<br> I'd better get the meat.<br> Yes, I understand that...<br> but there must be something<br> you want for Christmas...<br> something you haven't<br> even told your mother.<br> Oh, come on, now.<br> Why don't you give me a chance?<br> Well...<br> That's what<br> I want for Christmas.<br> A doll's house like this?<br> No, a real house.<br> If you're really Santa Claus,<br> you can get it for me.<br> And if you can't...<br> you're only a nice man with<br> a white beard, like mother said.<br> Now wait a minute, Suzie.<br> Just because every child<br> can't get his wish...<br> doesn't mean<br> there isn't a Santa Claus.<br> That's what I thought you'd say.<br> But don't you see, dear?<br> Some children wish for things<br> they couldn't possibly use...<br> like real locomotives<br> or B-29s.<br> But this isn't like<br> a locomotive or a B-29.<br> It's awful big<br> for a little girl like you.<br> What could you do<br> with a house like this?<br> Live in it with my mother.<br> But you've got<br> this lovely apartment.<br> I don't think it's lovely.<br> I want a backyard with a great<br> big tree to put a swing on...<br> I guess you can't get it, huh?<br> I didn't say that.<br> Well...<br> Well, it's a tall order...<br> but I'll do my best.<br> May I keep this picture?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Thank you. Good night, Susan.<br> Good night, Mr. Kringle.<br> Nice place you've got here.<br> Was I lucky to get it!<br> You like living<br> in Manhattan?<br> It's all right.<br> Someday I'd like to get<br> a place on Long Island.<br> Not a big house.<br> One of those junior-partner<br> deals around Manhasset.<br> I know just<br> the kind of place you mean.<br> One of those<br> little Colonial houses.<br> Either that or Cape Cod.<br> You're right about Mrs. Walker.<br> A little more effort<br> on your part...<br> and she might crawl out<br> of that shell.<br> Take her to dinner, the theater.<br> I've tried that.<br> She's always too busy<br> with her job.<br> Try a little harder.<br> Those two are lost souls.<br> It's up to us to help them.<br> I'll take care of Suzie<br> if you take care of her mother.<br> - It's a deal.<br> - Ready?<br> Oh, no, you don't.<br> I'm not gonna be cheated.<br> All my life<br> I've wondered something.<br> Now's my chance to find out.<br> It's a question that's puzzled<br> the world for centuries.<br> Does Santa Claus sleep<br> with his whiskers outside or in?<br> Always sleep with them out.<br> Cold air makes them grow.<br> Joe, we're running<br> out of books.<br> I'll get some right away.<br> I need some more Wanamakers.<br> Yes, I know just what you want.<br> We don't carry that brand,<br> but I think Gimbels does.<br> Let me see. Yes, here it is.<br> I thought I noticed it before.<br> Looks like<br> an exceptional bargain.<br> Yes, it does. Thank you.<br> Not at all.<br> Why didn't one of you<br> think of this idea?<br> It's the greatest<br> goodwill policy I ever heard of.<br> Every shopper<br> in New York City...<br> suddenly thinks of Macy<br> as a benevolent soul...<br> thinking only of the welfare<br> of the public.<br> And what does that make Gimbel?<br> Nothing but a profiteering<br> moneygrubber.<br> Two can play at this game.<br> From now on, if we haven't got<br> what the customer wants...<br> send him back to Macy's.<br> And what's more, we'll do<br> the same thing in our stores...<br> in Philadelphia,<br> Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.<br> Get to work on it right away.<br> So, Gimbel's doing it<br> in Philadelphia...<br> Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?<br> And very successfully.<br> Well, we can cover<br> the country, too.<br> Notify our stores<br> in San Francisco...<br> Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark<br> to get going right away.<br> All right, Mr. Macy.<br> - Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.<br> - Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.<br> One more.<br> That's fine.<br> Now we'll take some<br> at my store.<br> Just a minute.<br> I have something I'd like<br> to give our friend here.<br> This is a little something<br> to show my appreciation...<br> for all you've done.<br> Thank you, Mr. Macy.<br> Ooh! That's very kind of you.<br> I didn't think<br> you were that generous.<br> That's a bit of money.<br> What are you going<br> to do with it?<br> Well, I have a friend.<br> A doctor.<br> He's been very kind to me.<br> He needs an x-ray machine.<br> I don't think<br> that's going to be enough.<br> I'll make up the difference.<br> Buy it through the store.<br> Get 10% discount.<br> I can get it for cost.<br> Good night, Susan.<br> Good night, Cleo.<br> Like me to sing you<br> a good night song?<br> If you want to.<br> Doesn't your mother<br> ever sing to you at night?<br> Uh-uh. Why should she?<br> Oh, no reason.<br> I just think it's kind of nice.<br> - Do you like "Market"?<br> - All right.<br> To market, to market<br> to buy a fat pig<br> Home again, home again,<br> jiggidy jig<br> To market, to market<br> to buy a fat hog<br> Home again, home again,<br> jiggidy...<br> Amazing.<br> Do you happen<br> to have a spare piece?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Well, here goes.<br> Oh!<br> - Hello, Alfred.<br> - Hello, Kris.<br> How about a game<br> of checkers after lunch?<br> Leave us not today.<br> I don't feel like it.<br> Oh? What's the matter?<br> Nothing. Nothing.<br> Something is wrong.<br> What is it?<br> Well,<br> remember I was telling you...<br> how I like to play Santa<br> at the "Y" on Christmas...<br> and give out packages<br> to the young kids?<br> I was telling that<br> to Mr. Sawyer, see...<br> and he says that's very bad.<br> Sawyer. You mean, uh...<br> That's the one.<br> He's a psychologist.<br> Ohh,<br> that's a debatable poin...<br> Why is it bad, does he say?<br> He says guys who dress<br> like Santa Claus, see...<br> and give presents away...<br> do it because<br> when they was young...<br> they must have<br> did something bad...<br> and they feel guilty about it.<br> So now they do something<br> they think is good...<br> to make up for it.<br> It's what he calls<br> a guilt complex.<br> How old are you, Alfred?<br> Seventeen.<br> Seventeen.<br> Doesn't seem you've had time<br> to be guilty of anything...<br> except overeating.<br> It's nothing to laugh about.<br> It's pretty serious, he says.<br> It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.<br> Don't listen.<br> Oh, he knows<br> what he's talking about.<br> He's been studying that stuff<br> for a long time.<br> Well, what's the basis<br> of this guilt complex...<br> you're supposed to have?<br> Does he say that?<br> Well, he ain't found out yet.<br> It's probably way down<br> inside of me someplace, see?<br> Maybe something that happened<br> when I was a baby, he says.<br> It takes time,<br> but he'll do it, he says.<br> You mean<br> you're going to him again?<br> Sure.<br> I go every day after lunch.<br> Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.<br> He's doing it for free<br> 'cause I'm an interesting case.<br> Yes.<br> What else has he found<br> wrong with you, Alfred?<br> Anything else?<br> No. Oh, just<br> that I hate my father.<br> I didn't know it,<br> but he says I do.<br> And he sees you every day?<br> Yeah. I say anything<br> that comes into my head.<br> Excuse me, Alfred.<br> A few things<br> have just come into my head...<br> and I'm going to say them.<br> Why are you busting in here?<br> Are you a licensed psychiatrist?<br> What business is it of yours?<br> I have great respect<br> for psychiatry...<br> and great contempt for amateurs<br> who go around practicing it.<br> You have no more right<br> to analyze Alfred...<br> than a dentist has<br> to remove a gallbladder!<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Your job here, I gather,<br> is to give intelligence tests.<br> Passing yourself off<br> as a psychologist.<br> You ought to be horsewhipped...<br> taking a normal, impressionable<br> boy like Alfred...<br> and filling him with complexes.<br> I'm better equipped<br> to judge that than you are.<br> Just because the boy<br> wants to be kind to children...<br> you tell him<br> he has a guilt complex.<br> Sharing his delusion,<br> you couldn't understand.<br> Alfred's definitely maladjusted,<br> and I'm helping.<br> Maladjusted?!<br> You talk about maladjusted.<br> It seems to me the patient<br> is running the clinic here.<br> I won't stand...<br> Leave this office immediately.<br> Now either<br> you stop analyzing Alfred...<br> or I go straight to Mr. Macy...<br> and tell him what a contemptible<br> fraud you are.<br> Leave or I'll call security.<br> There's only one way<br> to handle a man like you.<br> You won't listen to reason.<br> You're heartless.<br> You have no humanity.<br> Are you going to leave?<br> Yes.<br> - Kris.<br> - Mr. Sawyer!<br> Mr. Sawyer,<br> are you all right?<br> Look at that bump!<br> Mr. Sawyer...<br> He's unconscious!<br> Better get a wet towel.<br> No, better get a doctor.<br> You must have done<br> something to him.<br> I tell you<br> we were merely talking...<br> but when I mentioned Santa Claus<br> and attacked his delusion...<br> he became violent.<br> I told you he had<br> latent maniacal tendencies.<br> Well, I think this proves it.<br> Have Dr. Pierce<br> give him another examination.<br> Dr. Pierce...<br> He doesn't know anything<br> about this sort of thing.<br> He's a general practitioner.<br> You must admit<br> this is rather serious.<br> Perhaps we'd better get<br> a competent psychiatrist.<br> But he's taken dozens<br> of those examinations...<br> and passed them all 100%.<br> It's possible<br> his condition has changed.<br> I don't think<br> we can take any chances.<br> I can't see any harm in it.<br> If he passes the test,<br> he can return to work at once...<br> and if he doesn't,<br> it's better if we find out.<br> You better have<br> the examination right away...<br> before he tells Mr. Ma...<br> before Mr. Macy finds out.<br> Oh, my, yes.<br> You explain to Mr. Kringle.<br> After all, you're his friend.<br> I won't do it.<br> I've grown very fond of him.<br> This would be like telling him<br> I thought he was insane.<br> You don't call this<br> acting normal, do you?<br> Of course I don't...<br> but there are thousands<br> of elderly who aren't normal.<br> This will hurt Kris deeply,<br> and I don't want to do it!<br> That wouldn't be fair to him.<br> I'll tell him the truth.<br> I believe in being truthful<br> with people.<br> If he sees me<br> or you mention psychiatrist...<br> it's more or less attacking<br> his delusion again.<br> He's apt to become violent.<br> But in front of the children?<br> Oh, that would be terrible.<br> Get him out of the store<br> on some other pretext.<br> Then once outside,<br> I'll explain it to him.<br> If you think<br> it's better that way.<br> Keep a straight line.<br> All day long to see Santa Claus.<br> Oh!<br> - Mr. Kringle.<br> - Yes?<br> Mrs. Walker<br> wanted you to know...<br> that we're going to take<br> some publicity pictures...<br> this afternoon<br> down at the city hall...<br> you and the mayor.<br> Good. Like to meet him.<br> A few things<br> I'd like to discuss with him.<br> Oh, but I made an appointment<br> with Mr. Macy at 4:00.<br> I want to tell him<br> about something.<br> You'll be back<br> in plenty of time.<br> There's a car waiting<br> downstairs.<br> It's starting to drizzle.<br> You'll need a coat.<br> I'll get it.<br> Thanks. Be right with you.<br> I just want to take care<br> of a few kiddies first.<br> All right.<br> Where to?<br> Bellevue.<br> Bellevue?!<br> Did she know about this?<br> Yes.<br> We all discussed it.<br> The second party shall...<br> in consideration<br> of the property...<br> agree to be conveyed<br> by the first party to...<br> Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.<br> Hello.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Why, yes,<br> we share an apartment together.<br> Bellevue?<br> But why, Doctor? What did he...<br> Oh, he's quite comfortable.<br> He's going to be with us<br> for a few days...<br> and wondered if you could bring<br> his personal things.<br> Yes, in view<br> of his examination...<br> I'm afraid I shall have<br> to recommend commitment.<br> Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey...<br> but I'd rather speak to you<br> in person.<br> I'll be right over, Doctor.<br> To see the new patient.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Not at all.<br> Hello, Kris.<br> Fred.<br> Why'd you do it, Kris?<br> You deliberately failed<br> that examination, didn't you?<br> Why?<br> Because the last few days<br> I've had great hope.<br> I had a feeling Doris was<br> beginning to believe in me.<br> And now I find out she was just<br> humoring me all the time.<br> I just telephoned her.<br> She didn't know anything about<br> taking pictures with the mayor.<br> That was Sawyer's idea.<br> Well, I'm glad of that.<br> But why didn't she come to me<br> and explain the whole thing?<br> She didn't want to hurt you.<br> Only because I was a nice,<br> kind old man she felt sorry for.<br> That's not true.<br> Yes, it is.<br> She had doubts.<br> That's why she was just sorry.<br> If you'd been dragged off here<br> instead of me...<br> she wouldn't have been sorry.<br> She'd have been furious.<br> All right,<br> she had doubts. Why not?<br> She hasn't really believed<br> in anything for years.<br> You can't expect her<br> to suddenly...<br> Oh, it's not just Doris.<br> There's Mr. Sawyer.<br> He's contemptible, dishonest,<br> selfish, deceitful, vicious...<br> Yet he's out there<br> and I'm in here.<br> He's called normal and I'm not.<br> Well, if that's normal,<br> I don't want it.<br> That's why<br> I answered incorrectly.<br> But, Kris, you can't<br> just think of yourself.<br> What happens to you matters<br> to a lot of people.<br> People like me, who believe<br> in what you stand for...<br> and people like Suzie,<br> who are just beginning to.<br> You can't quit.<br> You can't let them down.<br> No, I suppose I shouldn't.<br> Who knows, maybe someday<br> the Sawyers will be in here...<br> instead of out there.<br> You're right.<br> I ought to be ashamed of myself.<br> Even if we can't win,<br> we can go down swinging.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> You're forgetting you flunked<br> your examination but good.<br> Oh, yes, I forgot.<br> I said Calvin Coolidge<br> was the first president.<br> I can imagine what they're<br> thinking of me for saying that.<br> But you'll get me out of this.<br> You'll think of something.<br> It's not gonna be easy, Kris.<br> It will be for you.<br> I believe you're the greatest<br> lawyer since Darrow.<br> Just a second, Kris.<br> You're putting me in a bad spot.<br> But I believe in you.<br> You can't let me down.<br> But you don't understand. It...<br> I'll do everything I can, Kris.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> That's a lot of nonsense!<br> Dangerous, my foot!<br> I don't care<br> if he failed ten examinations.<br> You had no right to do it!<br> You get the case<br> dropped tomorrow...<br> or you might have another lump<br> to match the one Kris gave you!<br> Yes, Mr. Macy.<br> Age unknown.<br> Old man, huh?<br> Very old, Your Honor.<br> I suppose<br> I'll have to read all this.<br> Take my word for it.<br> Just routine commitment papers.<br> Cut and dried.<br> The man calls himself<br> Kris Kringle...<br> thinks he's Santa Claus.<br> Uh-oh.<br> Come in.<br> Mr. Gailey to see you,<br> Your Honor.<br> He represents Mr. Kringle.<br> Better show him in.<br> Good morning.<br> Your Honor, there seems to be<br> undue haste in this case.<br> I wish to protect my client's<br> rights, as I'm sure you do.<br> Of course.<br> I request a formal hearing...<br> to which I may bring witnesses.<br> - This is cut and dried?<br> - That's what I was told.<br> I didn't know anything<br> about a protest.<br> Of course, you may sign<br> the commitment papers now...<br> but I'll bring<br> a habeas corpus later.<br> There's no point in signing.<br> We'll have a hearing<br> on Monday morning at 10:00.<br> Thank you. Good day.<br> Thank you.<br> That man...<br> I heard him say something<br> about Mr. Kringle before.<br> Who is he?<br> His name is Gailey,<br> Kringle's lawyer.<br> Probably grabbed the case<br> to get some cheap publicity.<br> We can't have that.<br> Mr. Macy would rather drop this.<br> It can't be done.<br> It's too late now.<br> Kringle has been examined by<br> city hospital psychiatrists.<br> It has to follow due process.<br> We must avoid publicity.<br> I, uh... Oh.<br> Mr. Gailey,<br> I represent Mr. Macy.<br> My name's Sawyer.<br> Oh, so you're Sawyer.<br> Yes.<br> Regarding this Kringle matter...<br> We're very anxious<br> to avoid any publicity.<br> Naturally.<br> So if you would agree<br> to put this through quietly...<br> we'd surely find a generous way<br> to express our appreciation.<br> Very interesting.<br> Then you'll cooperate?<br> Very interesting.<br> Publicity. Hmm.<br> That's not a bad idea.<br> If I'm going to win this case...<br> I'll have to have plenty<br> of public opinion.<br> And publicity's<br> just the way to do it.<br> Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.<br> Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.<br> Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!<br> I don't see what<br> they're making a fuss about.<br> After all, he's an old man.<br> How've you been feeling lately?<br> You look a little run-down.<br> Me? Why, I feel fine.<br> Never better.<br> Why not see the doc?<br> Take a few weeks off.<br> Go fishing, go hunting.<br> Go anyplace.<br> Why should I?<br> Because<br> this Kringle case is dynamite.<br> Let some judge handle it that<br> isn't coming up for reelection.<br> I can't do that.<br> I'm no legal brain trust.<br> I don't know<br> a habeas from a corpus.<br> But I do know politics.<br> That's my racket.<br> I got you elected, didn't I?<br> And I'm gonna try<br> to get you reelected.<br> I appreciate everything<br> that you've done for me.<br> Then get off this case.<br> But why?<br> You're a Pontius Pilate<br> the minute you start.<br> Oh, I don't believe it.<br> I'm an honest man...<br> and nobody's going<br> to hold it against me...<br> for doing my duty as I see it.<br> Grandma!<br> Grandma!<br> Grandma!<br> Good night, Terry.<br> Good night, Alice.<br> Now, straight to bed.<br> I promised your mother<br> you'd be in bed by 8:00...<br> and it's way past.<br> Aren't you coming, too?<br> I'll be up soon<br> to tuck you in. Now, scoot!<br> How about a great big kiss<br> for Grandpa, hmm?<br> Hmmph!<br> Hmmph!<br> Fine way<br> to treat their grandfather!<br> No hug, no kiss, no anything.<br> I don't blame them.<br> Any man who'd put Santa Claus<br> on trial for lunacy.<br> See what I mean?<br> Hey.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I've got the best lawyer<br> in the world.<br> How long do you think<br> this will take?<br> Maybe a week.<br> A week?! That seems impossible!<br> That lawyer<br> won't be stupid enough...<br> to let him admit anything.<br> He'll deny everything.<br> I'll bring witnesses,<br> and he'll bring witnesses.<br> Hear ye, hear ye.<br> All persons having business...<br> with the supreme court<br> of the county of New York...<br> draw near, give attendance,<br> and ye shall be heard.<br> You have Kris Kringle's<br> commitment papers.<br> I'd like to call<br> the first witness.<br> Mr. Kringle,<br> will you take the stand?<br> Good morning, Your Honor.<br> You do solemnly swear...<br> the testimony you'll give<br> shall be the whole truth...<br> so help you God?<br> I do.<br> Before you begin, I want<br> to explain to the witness...<br> this is a hearing, not a trial.<br> Mr. Kringle...<br> you don't have to answer<br> against your wishes...<br> or even testify at all.<br> We have no objection,<br> Your Honor.<br> I'll be glad to answer<br> any questions I can.<br> What is your name?<br> Kris Kringle.<br> Where do you live?<br> That's what this hearing<br> will decide.<br> A very sound answer,<br> Mr. Kringle.<br> Do you believe<br> that you're Santa Claus?<br> Of course.<br> The state rests, Your Honor.<br> Well, Mr. Gailey...<br> do you wish to cross-examine<br> the witness?<br> I believe he was employed<br> to play Santa Claus.<br> Perhaps he didn't understand<br> the question correctly.<br> Oh, I understood perfectly,<br> Your Honor.<br> No further questions<br> at this time.<br> Thank you.<br> In view of this statement...<br> do you still wish<br> to put in a defense?<br> I do, Your Honor.<br> I'm fully aware<br> of my client's opinions.<br> That's the entire case<br> against him.<br> All these complicated tests<br> boil down to this:<br> Mr. Kringle is not sane...<br> because he believes himself<br> to be Santa Claus.<br> An entirely logical...<br> and reasonable assumption,<br> I'm afraid.<br> It would be if the clerk,<br> Mr. Marrah, or I...<br> believed we were Santa Claus.<br> Anyone who thinks<br> he's Santa Claus is not sane.<br> Not necessarily.<br> You believe yourself<br> to be Judge Harper...<br> yet no one questions your sanity<br> because you are Judge Harper.<br> I know all about myself,<br> young man.<br> Mr. Kringle is the subject<br> of this hearing.<br> Yes, Your Honor...<br> and if he is the person<br> he believes himself to be...<br> just as you are,<br> then he's just as sane.<br> Granted, but he isn't.<br> Oh, but he is.<br> Is what?<br> I intend to prove<br> that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.<br> He's crazy, too!<br> Hi, darling.<br> Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.<br> I reserved our table at Luigi's.<br> We're gonna celebrate.<br> What are we celebrating?<br> Read all about it.<br> "Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."<br> Yes, I read that.<br> I didn't see this...<br> Front page! Good. Good.<br> You're not serious about this?<br> Of course I am.<br> But you can't possibly<br> prove he's Santa Claus.<br> Why not? You saw Macy<br> and Gimbel shaking hands.<br> That wasn't possible either,<br> but it happened.<br> It's the best defense I can use.<br> Completely logical<br> and completely unexpected.<br> And completely idiotic.<br> What about your bosses...<br> Haislip and Mackenzie<br> and the rest?<br> What do they say?<br> That I'm jeopardizing<br> the prestige and dignity...<br> of an old, established<br> law firm...<br> and either I drop this<br> impossible case immediately...<br> or they will drop me.<br> I beat them to it. I quit.<br> Fred, you didn't.<br> Of course I did.<br> I can't let Kris down.<br> He needs me,<br> and all the rest of us need him.<br> Darling,<br> he's a nice old man...<br> and I admire you<br> for wanting to help him...<br> but you've got to be realistic<br> and face facts.<br> You can't just<br> throw your career away...<br> because of a sentimental whim.<br> But I'm not<br> throwing my career away.<br> If Haislip feels that way...<br> so will every other law firm.<br> I'm sure they will.<br> I'll open my own office.<br> What kind of cases will you get?<br> Probably people like<br> Kris who are being bullied.<br> That's the only fun in law<br> anyway.<br> If you believe in me<br> and have faith in me...<br> everything will...<br> You don't have any faith in me,<br> do you?<br> It's not about faith.<br> It's just common sense.<br> Faith is believing in things...<br> when common sense<br> tells you not to.<br> It's not just Kris<br> that's on trial.<br> It's everything he stands for.<br> It's kindness, joy, love,<br> and all other intangibles.<br> Fred,<br> you're talking like a child.<br> You're living<br> in a realistic world!<br> Those lovely intangibles<br> aren't worth much.<br> You don't get ahead that way.<br> That all depends<br> on what you call getting ahead.<br> Evidently,<br> we have different definitions.<br> We've talked<br> about wonderful plans.<br> Then you go<br> on an idealistic binge.<br> You give up your job,<br> throw away your security...<br> and then you expect me<br> to be happy about it!<br> Yes,<br> I guess I expected too much.<br> Someday,<br> you're going to find out...<br> that your way of facing<br> this realistic world...<br> just doesn't work.<br> And when you do...<br> don't overlook<br> those lovely intangibles.<br> You'll discover<br> they're the only things...<br> that are worthwhile.<br> These reporters make me<br> look like a sadistic monster...<br> who likes to drown cats...<br> and tear the wings<br> off butterflies.<br> Why, this old man...<br> Tommy, go get<br> mother's scissors, will you?<br> They're in the bedroom.<br> That's a good boy.<br> I don't want to discuss<br> this case in front of him.<br> It'll break his heart.<br> While we're on the subject,<br> I agree with the reporters.<br> Mr. Kringle seems<br> to be a nice old man.<br> I don't see why you have<br> to keep persecuting him.<br> Firstly,<br> I am not persecuting him.<br> I am prosecuting him.<br> And secondly,<br> I like the old man, too.<br> I wish<br> I'd never gotten into this.<br> But it's too late now. There's<br> nothing I can do about it.<br> It's up to the state<br> of New York.<br> I'm their duly appointed<br> legal representative.<br> Kringle has been declared<br> a menace to society...<br> by competent doctors.<br> It's my duty to protect<br> the state of New York...<br> and see that he's put away.<br> No matter what they say<br> about me...<br> I've got to do it.<br> Sometimes I wish I'd married<br> a butcher or a plumber.<br> Well, my dear,<br> if I lose this case...<br> it's very possible<br> that you'll get your wish.<br> Hello, Kris.<br> Your name?<br> R.H. Macy.<br> You are the owner...<br> of one of the biggest<br> department stores...<br> in New York City?<br> The biggest.<br> Who is the gentleman<br> seated there?<br> Kris Kringle.<br> - Your employee?<br> - Yes.<br> Do you believe him<br> to be truthful?<br> Yes.<br> You believe him to be<br> of sound mind?<br> I certainly do.<br> Mr. Macy, you're under oath.<br> You really believe<br> this man is Santa Claus?<br> Well, I...<br> Well, he gives<br> every indication...<br> Do you really believe<br> he's Santa Claus?<br> I do.<br> You do?<br> That's all.<br> Psychologist!<br> Where'd you graduate from,<br> a correspondence school?<br> You're fired.<br> Your Honor,<br> I object to this testimony.<br> It's ridiculous, irrelevant,<br> and immaterial.<br> Mr. Gailey is making<br> a circus of this court.<br> There is no such person<br> as Santa Claus...<br> and everybody knows it.<br> I submit<br> it's purely a matter of opinion.<br> Can Mr. Marrah disprove<br> Santa's existence?<br> No. I don't intend to.<br> This isn't a nursery. It's the<br> New York State Supreme Court.<br> I'll not waste this court's time<br> with such nonsense!<br> Mr. Marrah seems to have<br> appointed himself judge.<br> He's ruling on what testimony<br> I may introduce.<br> We request an immediate<br> ruling from this court.<br> Is there or is there not<br> a Santa Claus?<br> Well...<br> Ahem!<br> The court will take a recess<br> to consider the matter.<br> I don't care what you do<br> with old whisker puss...<br> but if you rule<br> that there's no Santa Claus...<br> you better start looking<br> for that chicken farm.<br> We won't even be able<br> to put you in the primaries.<br> But, Charley, listen to reason.<br> I'm a responsible judge.<br> I've taken an oath.<br> How can I seriously rule<br> there is a Santa Claus?<br> Why don't you...<br> All right.<br> Tell them the New York<br> State Supreme Court rules...<br> there's no Santa Claus.<br> It's all over the papers.<br> The kids don't hang up<br> their stockings.<br> Now, what happens<br> to all the toys...<br> that are supposed to be<br> in those stockings?<br> Nobody buys them.<br> The toy manufacturers<br> are going to like that.<br> So they have to lay off<br> a lot of their employees...<br> union employees.<br> Now you got the C.I.O.<br> And the A.F.L. Against you.<br> And they're gonna adore you<br> for it.<br> And they're gonna say it<br> with votes.<br> And the department stores<br> will love you, too...<br> and the Christmas card makers...<br> and the candy companies.<br> Oh, Henry, you're going to be<br> an awful popular fellow.<br> And what about<br> the Salvation Army?<br> Why, they got a Santa Claus<br> on every corner...<br> and they take in a fortune.<br> But you go ahead, Henry.<br> You do it your way.<br> You go on back in there<br> and tell them...<br> that you rule<br> there's no Santa Claus.<br> But if you do, remember this:<br> You can count on getting<br> just two votes...<br> your own and that<br> district attorney's out there.<br> The district attorney's<br> a Republican.<br> All rise!<br> Before making a ruling...<br> this court has consulted<br> the highest authority available.<br> The question of Santa Claus...<br> seems to be largely<br> a matter of opinion.<br> Many people<br> firmly believe in him.<br> Others do not.<br> The tradition<br> of American justice demands...<br> a broad, unprejudiced view<br> of such a controversial matter.<br> This court, therefore,<br> intends to keep an open mind.<br> I'll hear all the evidence.<br> He's crazy, too.<br> The burden of proof for this<br> ridiculous contention...<br> clearly rests with my opponent.<br> Can he produce evidence<br> to support his views?<br> If Your Honor pleases, I can.<br> Will Thomas Marrah<br> please take the stand?<br> Who, me?<br> Thomas Marrah, Jr.<br> Hello, Daddy.<br> Here you are, Tommy.<br> Tommy,<br> you know the difference...<br> between telling the truth<br> and telling a lie, right?<br> Everybody knows you<br> shouldn't tell a lie...<br> especially in court.<br> Proceed, Mr. Gailey.<br> Do you believe in Santa Claus?<br> Sure I do.<br> He gave me a brand-new<br> flexible flyer sled last year.<br> And what does he look like?<br> There he is, sitting there.<br> Your Honor, I protest!<br> Overruled.<br> Tell me, Tommy...<br> why are you so sure<br> there's a Santa Claus?<br> Because my daddy told me so.<br> Didn't you, Daddy?<br> You believe your daddy,<br> don't you?<br> He's a very honest man.<br> Of course he is.<br> My daddy wouldn't tell me<br> anything that wasn't so.<br> Would you, Daddy?<br> Thank you, Tommy.<br> Good-bye, Daddy.<br> Your Honor...<br> Don't forget.<br> A real official football helmet.<br> Don't worry, Tommy.<br> You'll get it.<br> Your Honor,<br> the state of New York...<br> concedes the existence<br> of Santa Claus.<br> But we ask that Mr. Gailey<br> cease presenting...<br> personal opinion as evidence.<br> We could bring witnesses<br> with opposite opinions...<br> but we desire<br> to shorten this hearing...<br> rather than prolong it.<br> I request that Mr. Gailey...<br> now submit<br> authoritative proof...<br> that Mr. Kringle...<br> is the one-and-only Santa Claus.<br> Your point's well taken.<br> I'm afraid we must agree.<br> Mr. Gailey, can you show that<br> Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus...<br> on the basis<br> of competent authority?<br> Not at this time, Your Honor.<br> I ask for an adjournment<br> until tomorrow.<br> Court stands adjourned<br> till tomorrow afternoon, 3:00.<br> Well, I guess that's that.<br> There's a way, Alfred.<br> There's got to be!<br> It's hard to explain.<br> They're having a trial<br> about him.<br> You mean like for murder?<br> No, it isn't that kind<br> of a trial.<br> It's just because<br> he says he's Santa Claus.<br> I've got a feeling<br> he is Santa Claus.<br> Some people don't<br> believe that. That's why...<br> But he's so kind<br> and nice and jolly.<br> He's not like anyone else.<br> He must be Santa.<br> I think<br> perhaps you're right, Suzie.<br> Is Mr. Kringle sad now,<br> Mother?<br> I'm afraid he is.<br> I'm sure he misses you.<br> Then I'll write him<br> a letter and cheer him up.<br> Hey, Lou, come here!<br> Yeah?<br> Here's a new one.<br> I seen them write<br> to Santa Claus...<br> North Pole, South Pole,<br> and every other place.<br> This kid writes...<br> "Kris Kringle,<br> New York County Courthouse."<br> The kid's right.<br> They got him on trial there.<br> He claims he's Santa Claus,<br> and the D.A. Claims he's nuts.<br> Read it for yourself.<br> Right on the front page.<br> Hey, Lou,<br> how many Santa Claus letters...<br> we got<br> at the dead-letter office?<br> I don't know.<br> There must be<br> about 50,000 of them.<br> Bags and bags<br> all over the joint.<br> And there's more coming in<br> every day.<br> Yeah. Hey, Lou.<br> It'd be nice<br> to get rid of them, huh?<br> Yeah, but...<br> Hey, that's a wonderful idea!<br> Why should we be<br> bothered with all that stuff?<br> Why not get some trucks?<br> Big ones right away.<br> Load them with Santa Claus mail<br> and deliver it...<br> to Mr. Kringle<br> at the courthouse.<br> Let somebody else<br> worry about it, huh?<br> Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells<br> Jingle all the way<br> Hello, Kris.<br> Fred.<br> Kris, I'm afraid<br> I've got bad news for you.<br> I've tried every way to get<br> some competent authority.<br> I've wired the governor,<br> the mayor. I even...<br> This is worth more to me...<br> than all the governors<br> and mayors in the world.<br> It's all over. Look at him.<br> He hasn't got a thing.<br> And furthermore,<br> the defense has yet to offer...<br> one concrete<br> piece of evidence...<br> to substantiate<br> this preposterous claim.<br> Not one authoritative proof<br> that this man is Santa Claus.<br> In view of these facts...<br> and especially since<br> today is Christmas Eve...<br> we're, naturally,<br> all anxious to get home...<br> I ask that you sign<br> the commitment papers...<br> without further delay.<br> Mr. Gailey...<br> have you anything further<br> to offer?<br> Yes, I have, Your Honor.<br> I'd like to submit the following<br> facts in evidence.<br> It concerns<br> the Post Office Department...<br> an official agency<br> of the United States government.<br> "The Post Office Department<br> was created...<br> "by the Second<br> Continental Congress...<br> "on July 26, 1776.<br> "The first postmaster general<br> was Benjamin Franklin.<br> "The Post Office...<br> "is one of the world's<br> largest business concerns.<br> "Last year,<br> under Robert Hannigan...<br> "it did a gross business<br> of $1,112,877,174."<br> We're all gratified to know...<br> the Post Office<br> is doing nicely...<br> but it hardly has<br> any bearing on this case.<br> It has a great deal, Your Honor,<br> if I may be allowed to proceed.<br> By all means, Mr. Gailey.<br> Your Honor, the figures<br> I have just quoted...<br> indicate an efficiently run<br> organization.<br> United States postal laws<br> and regulations...<br> make it a criminal offense<br> to willfully misdirect mail...<br> or intentionally deliver it<br> to the wrong party.<br> Consequently...<br> the Department uses<br> every possible precaution.<br> The state of New York<br> admires the Post Office.<br> It is efficient, authoritative,<br> and prosperous.<br> We're happy to concede<br> Mr. Gailey's claims.<br> For the record?<br> For the record.<br> Anything to get this case going.<br> Then I want<br> to introduce this evidence.<br> I'll take them, please.<br> I have three letters<br> addressed simply "Santa Claus."<br> No other address whatsoever.<br> Yet these were just now<br> delivered to Mr. Kringle...<br> by bona fide employees<br> of the Post Office.<br> I offer them<br> as positive proof that...<br> Uh, three letters<br> are hardly positive proof.<br> I understand the Post Office<br> receives thousands of these.<br> I have further exhibits,<br> but I hesitate to produce them.<br> We'll be very happy to see them.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Produce them, Mr. Gailey.<br> Put them here on my desk.<br> But, Your Honor...<br> Put them here on the desk.<br> Put them here.<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> Your Honor!<br> Your Honor!<br> Your Honor...<br> every one of these letters<br> is addressed to Santa Claus.<br> The Post Office<br> has delivered them.<br> Therefore, the Post Office...<br> a branch<br> of the federal government...<br> recognizes this man,<br> Kris Kringle...<br> to be the one-and-only<br> Santa Claus!<br> Since the United States<br> government...<br> declares this man<br> to be Santa Claus...<br> this court will not dispute it.<br> Case dismissed.<br> I've got to get<br> that football helmet!<br> Thank you so much,<br> Your Honor...<br> and a very merry Christmas<br> to you.<br> Thank you, Mr. Kringle,<br> and the same to you.<br> Thank you.<br> Kris.<br> I had to wait to tell you.<br> I got your note.<br> It made me very happy.<br> Oh, I'm so glad.<br> We're having<br> a big Christmas party...<br> at the Brooks' Home<br> tomorrow morning.<br> Breakfast, a beautiful tree.<br> I'd like to have you and Susan.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> There's no one I'd rather<br> spend Christmas with.<br> Would you like<br> to come to dinner tonight?<br> Tonight? Oh, I can't.<br> It's Christmas Eve.<br> Oh, I forgot.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, my dear sir...<br> you know my assistant Alfred,<br> Mr. Macy?<br> Merry Christmas, Alfred.<br> Mr. Macy!<br> Hello, Alfred.<br> Mr. Macy!<br> Kris, all I can say<br> is the state supreme court...<br> declared you<br> to be Santa Claus...<br> and personally<br> and professionally...<br> I agree with them.<br> But there are lots<br> of presents there for you.<br> Not the one I wanted.<br> Not the one Mr. Kringle<br> was going to get for me.<br> Well, what was that?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I didn't get it.<br> I knew it wouldn't be here...<br> but I thought<br> there'd be a letter.<br> I don't suppose<br> you even want to talk to me.<br> Something about a present.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I'm sorry, Suzie.<br> I tried my best, but...<br> You couldn't get it<br> because you're not Santa.<br> You're just a nice old man<br> with whiskers...<br> like my mother said...<br> and I shouldn't have<br> believed you.<br> I was wrong<br> when I told you that.<br> You must believe in Mr. Kringle<br> and keep right on doing it.<br> You must have faith in him.<br> But he didn't get me the...<br> That doesn't make sense, Mommy.<br> Faith is believing in things...<br> when common sense<br> tells you not to.<br> Huh?<br> Just because things<br> don't turn out...<br> the way you want them to<br> the first time...<br> you've still got to believe<br> in people.<br> I found that out.<br> You mean like...<br> "If at first you don't succeed,<br> try, try again"?<br> Yes.<br> I thought so.<br> May I drive you home?<br> Thank you.<br> If you'll go this way,<br> you'll miss a lot of traffic.<br> You go along Maplewood<br> until you've come to Ashley...<br> I believe. I believe.<br> It's silly, but I believe.<br> Thanks, Kris.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Merry Christmas to you.<br> And to you, my dear,<br> and many of them.<br> Good-bye, my dear.<br> Good-bye, Mrs. Walker.<br> Good-bye, Alfred.<br> Good-bye, Suzie.<br> This must be the turn here.<br> That's right. Ashley.<br> Now you go straight<br> for four blocks.<br> I believe. I believe.<br> Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!<br> Stop! Stop!<br> Suzie!<br> Suzie!<br> Suzie, where are you going?<br> What is she doing?<br> - Suzie!<br> - Suzie!<br> Suzie, where are you?<br> I'm upstairs!<br> You shouldn't run around<br> in other people's houses.<br> You know better than that.<br> But this is my house,<br> the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.<br> It is! I know it is!<br> My room upstairs is like<br> I knew it would be!<br> You were right, Mommy.<br> Mommy said if things<br> don't turn out right at first...<br> you've still got to believe.<br> I kept believing.<br> You were right, Mommy!<br> Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!<br> Where are you going?<br> To see if there's a swing!<br> There is one! There is one!<br> You told her that?<br> The sign outside<br> said it's for sale.<br> We can't let her down.<br> I never really doubted you.<br> It was just<br> my silly common sense.<br> It even makes sense<br> to believe in me now.<br> I must be a pretty good lawyer.<br> I take a little old man...<br> and legally prove<br> that he's Santa Claus.<br> Now, you know that...<br> Oh, no. It can't be.<br> It must have been left<br> by the people that moved out.<br> Maybe.<br> Maybe I didn't do such<br> a wonderful thing after all.<br>
