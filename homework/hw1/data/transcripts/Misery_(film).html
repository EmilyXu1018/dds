It's got character.<br> When I wrote my first book<br> I carried it in this...<br> ...while I was looking for a publisher.<br> - I was a writer then.<br> - You're still a writer.<br> Haven't been a writer<br> since I got in the Misery business.<br> It's not a bad business.<br> And it would still be growing, too.<br> The first printing for Misery's Child<br> was the most ever. Over a million.<br> Marcia, please.<br> Misery Chastain is putting<br> your daughter through college...<br> ...bought you two houses<br> and seats to the Knicks.<br> What thanks does she get?<br> You go and kill her!<br> I never meant for it to become my life.<br> If I hadn't gotten rid of her now,<br> I'd have ended up writing her for ever.<br> Now I'm leaving for Colorado<br> to try to finish the new book.<br> If I can make this work... I might just<br> have something I want on my tombstone.<br> (thud)<br> (groans)<br> (distorted woman's voice)<br> I'm your number one fan.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> You're gonna be just fine.<br> I'll take good care of you.<br> I'm your number one fan.<br> Where...<br> We're just outside Silver Creek.<br> How long?<br> You've been here two days.<br> You're gonna be OK.<br> - My name is Annie Wilkes.<br> - My number one fan.<br> Yes. That's right. I'm also a nurse.<br> Here, take these.<br> Here.<br> - What are they?<br> - They're called Novril. For your pain.<br> Thank you.<br> How come I'm not in the hospital?<br> The blizzard was too strong.<br> I couldn't risk trying to get you there.<br> I tried calling,<br> but the phone lines are down.<br> I... Agh...<br> You mustn't tire yourself.<br> You've gotta rest.<br> You almost died.<br> Open wide.<br> (groans)<br> Your legs just sing grand opera<br> when you move, don't they?<br> It's not gonna hurt for ever, Paul,<br> I promise you.<br> - Will I be able to walk?<br> - Of course you will.<br> And your arm will be fine, too.<br> Your shoulder was badly dislocated.<br> It was a little stubborn,<br> but I finally popped it back in.<br> What I'm most proud of<br> is the work I did on those legs.<br> Considering what I had in the house,<br> I don't think a doctor could've done better.<br> It's not nearly as bad as it looks.<br> You have a compound fracture<br> of the tibia in both legs.<br> The fibula in the right leg<br> is fractured, too.<br> I could hear the bones moving, so it's best<br> for your legs to remain immobile.<br> And as soon as the roads open,<br> I'll take you to a hospital.<br> Meantime, you've got<br> a lot of recovering to do...<br> ...and I consider it an honour<br> that you'll do it in my home.<br> This is Marcia Sindell,<br> calling from New York City.<br> I'd like to speak to the Silver Creek<br> chief of police or sheriff.<br> - Which one do you want?<br> - Whichever one's not busy.<br> Well, I'm pretty sure they're both not<br> busy, Miz Sindell, since they're both me.<br> I also happen to be president of<br> the Policeman's Benefit Association...<br> ...chairman of the Patrolman's<br> Retirement Fund...<br> ...and if you need a good fishin' guide<br> you could do a lot worse.<br> Call me Buster. Everybody does.<br> What can I do for ya?<br> I'm a literary agent and I...<br> I feel like a fool calling you...<br> ...but I think one of my clients, Paul<br> Sheldon, may be in some kind of trouble.<br> - You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - He's your client, huh?<br> - Yes, he is.<br> Well, everybody sure likes<br> those Misery books.<br> Yeah.<br> Paul's been coming to the Silver Creek<br> Lodge for years to finish his books.<br> I understand he's been up here<br> the last six weeks.<br> Well, not quite. I just called there.<br> They said he checked out last Tuesday.<br> Isn't that a little strange?<br> I don't know. Does he usually phone you<br> before he checks out of a hotel?<br> No. No, of course not. It's just<br> that his daughter hasn't heard from him...<br> ...and when he has a new book<br> coming out he usually keeps in touch.<br> So when there wasn't<br> any word from him...<br> You think he might be missin', huh?<br> (sighs) I hate that I made this call.<br> Tell me I'm being silly.<br> Oh, a little overprotective maybe, but...<br> Tell you what I'll do.<br> Nothing's been reported out here,<br> but I'll put his name through our system.<br> If anything turns up,<br> I'll call you right back.<br> I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.<br> Goodbye, Miz Sindell.<br> We got a phone call? Busy morning.<br> Yeah. Work, work, work.<br> Virginia, when was that blizzard?<br> Last Tuesday. Why?<br> No reason.<br> I guess it was kind of a miracle<br> you finding me.<br> (chuckles)<br> No, it wasn't a miracle at all.<br> - In a way, I was following you.<br> - You were following me?<br> Well, it was no secret to me<br> you were staying at the Silver Creek...<br> ...seeing as how<br> I'm your number one fan an' all.<br> Some nights I'd just tool on<br> down there and sit outside...<br> ...and look up at the light in your cabin.<br> I'd try to imagine what was goin' on<br> in the room of the world's greatest writer.<br> - Say that again, I didn't hear you.<br> - Don't move now.<br> I wouldn't wanna hurt this neck.<br> Well, the other afternoon<br> I was on my way home...<br> ...and there you were, leavin' the lodge.<br> I wondered why a literary genius would<br> go for a drive with a big storm comin'.<br> I didn't know there<br> was a big storm coming.<br> Well, lucky for you I did.<br> Lucky for me, too...<br> ...cos now you're alive<br> and you can write more books.<br> Oh, Paul, I've read everything of yours.<br> The Misery novels -<br> I know 'em all by heart.<br> All eight of 'em. I love them so.<br> - Well, you're very kind.<br> - And you're very brilliant.<br> Like a baby. All done.<br> Thank you.<br> When do you think the phone lines'll<br> be up? I have to call my daughter...<br> ...and I'd like to call my agent<br> and let her know I'm still breathing.<br> It shouldn't be much longer.<br> Once the roads are open,<br> the phone lines'll be up in no time.<br> If you give me their numbers<br> I'll keep tryin'.<br> Thank you.<br> Could I ask you a favour?<br> I noticed in your case<br> there's a new Paul Sheldon book.<br> I wondered if maybe...<br> - You want to read it?<br> - Well, if you wouldn't mind.<br> I do have a hard-and-fast rule as to<br> who reads my stuff at this early stage.<br> Only my editor, my agent...<br> ...and anybody that saves me<br> from freezing to death in a car wreck.<br> You'll never realise<br> what a rare treat you've given me.<br> (groans)<br> Boy, it's like clockwork<br> the way your pain comes.<br> I'll get the Novril. Forgive me for prattling<br> away and making you feel all oogy.<br> What's your new book called?<br> I don't have a title yet.<br> What's it about?<br> I don't know.<br> I know it sounds crazy, but I haven't<br> written anything but Misery for so long...<br> Why don't you read it? You can<br> tell me what you think it's about.<br> Maybe you can come up with a title.<br> Like I could do that!<br> (man) There's nothin' unusual<br> about Mr Sheldon's leaving, Buster.<br> - You can tell by the champagne.<br> - Maybe you can, Libby.<br> See, he always orders a bottle<br> of Dom Prignon when he's ready to go.<br> Then he pays up and he's out the door.<br> No long-distance phone calls<br> or Federal Express packages?<br> Anything out of the ordinary?<br> I don't think Mr Sheldon likes<br> for things to be out of the ordinary.<br> Considering who he is, famous an' all,<br> he doesn't put on airs.<br> Drives up from New York<br> in the same car each time, '65 Mustang.<br> He says it helps him to think.<br> He's always been a good guest. Never<br> makes a noise, never bothers a soul.<br> - I sure hope nothing's happened to him.<br> - So do I.<br> I bet that old Mustang's<br> pulling into New York right now.<br> I'm sure you're right. Thanks, Libby.<br> My pleasure.<br> I know I'm only 40 pages<br> into your book, but...<br> But what?<br> - Nothing.<br> - No, no... What is it?<br> Well, it's ridiculous. Who am I<br> to make a criticism to someone like you?<br> It's all right, I can take it.<br> Well, it's brilliantly written...<br> But then everything you write is brilliant.<br> Pretty rough so far.<br> The swearing, Paul.<br> There, I said it.<br> The, uh... the profanity bothers you?<br> It has no nobility.<br> These are slum kids. I was a slum kid.<br> Everybody talks like that.<br> They do not! What do you think I say<br> when I go to the feed store in town?<br> "Wally, give me a bag of that effing pig<br> feed and 10lb of that bitchly cow corn!"<br> And in the bank do I tell Mrs Bollinger<br> "Here's one big bastard of a cheque...<br> ...give me some Christing money!"<br> There! Look there!<br> See what you made me do?<br> Oh, Paul, I'm sorry.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Oh...<br> Sometimes I get so worked up.<br> Can you ever forgive me?<br> It's... fine.<br> I love you, Paul.<br> Your mind. Your creativity.<br> That's all I meant.<br> Well, this sure is fun.<br> Virginia, when you're in this car<br> you're not my wife, you're my deputy.<br> Well, this deputy'd rather be home<br> under the covers with the sheriff.<br> - Stop. Stop!<br> - What?<br> - See that broken limb?<br> - Could've been the weight of the snow.<br> Yeah. Could've been a rotten branch,<br> the wind, could've been a lot of things.<br> Oh...<br> Damn!<br> Need some help?<br> No, I'm enjoyin' myself! Thank you.<br> - You really think Sheldon's out there?<br> - I hope not. If he is, he's dead.<br> Let's go to the newspaper office.<br> Oh, I hope I didn't wake you.<br> No, that's fine.<br> Look what I got. They had it at the store,<br> Paul. There was a whole batch of 'em.<br> As soon as I saw it I slammed<br> my money down - I got the first copy.<br> - Then the roads are open.<br> - The one to town is, but that's about it.<br> I called the hospital and talked<br> to the head orthopaedic surgeon...<br> ...and I told him who you were<br> and what had happened.<br> He said as long as there's no infection<br> you're not in any danger.<br> As soon as the road to the hospital is<br> open they'll send an ambulance for you.<br> The phones are working?<br> Well, mine's still out, but the ones in town<br> were working fine. I called your agent.<br> Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.<br> What a wonderful first page.<br> - Just to read the name Misery Chastain...<br> - My daughter will be goin' nuts.<br> - It's like a visit from my dearest friend.<br> - I should be home for her birthday today.<br> The agent said she'd tell her you're OK...<br> ...but you'll have to wait till tomorrow<br> to talk to her yourself.<br> Oh, Paul... What a poet you are.<br> I made you my specialty,<br> scrambled eggs la Wilkes.<br> And I'm on page 75.<br> I guess that means it's OK.<br> No.<br> No, it isn't, it's...<br> Oh, pooh, I can't think of any words.<br> Would "great" be insulting?<br> I can live with great.<br> No... It's not just great, it's...<br> ...perfect.<br> A perfect, perfect thing.<br> (grunting)<br> I thought it was time<br> you two should meet.<br> Paul, say hello to my favourite beast<br> in the whole world - my sow Misery.<br> Misery?<br> Yes. I told you I was your number one fan.<br> Yeah, I'm, uh... starting to believe you.<br> This farm was kind of dreary, what with<br> just a few cows and chickens and me.<br> But when I got Misery here everything<br> changed. She just makes me smile so.<br> She's a fine, uh... pig, is what she is.<br> I'm on page 300 now, Paul...<br> ...and it's better than perfect. It's divine.<br> What's the ceiling that dago painted?<br> - The Sistine Chapel.<br> - Yeah! That and Misery's Child...<br> ...those are the only two divine<br> things ever in this world!<br> (snorts)<br> When my husband left me,<br> I wasn't prepared.<br> It wasn't an easy time.<br> For a while I thought I might go crazy.<br> Yeah, I know how that can be.<br> I don't know about you, but what I did<br> to get through it was I dove into work.<br> Days, nights...<br> Night shifts can be lonely<br> at a hospital. I did a lot of reading.<br> That was when I first discovered Misery.<br> She made me so happy.<br> She made me forget all my problems.<br> Course, I suppose you had<br> a little something to do with that, too.<br> Yeah, well...<br> I just kept reading them over and over.<br> I've got two chapters to go on this one...<br> ...and when I finish I'll turn right to the first<br> page and start reading it all over again.<br> I'm, uh...<br> - Done?<br> - Yeah.<br> No problem.<br> Thanks.<br> Don't get me wrong.<br> I'm not against marriage per se...<br> ...but it'd take a pretty special guy to make<br> me wanna walk down that aisle again.<br> Yeah, it's, uh, not something<br> you should enter into lightly.<br> It boils down to respect.<br> People just don't respect<br> the institution of marriage any more.<br> They have no sense of real commitment.<br> Well, I'd love to stay here and chat...<br> ...but I'm right at the end<br> and I gotta find out what happens.<br> (door opens and closes)<br> You...<br> You dirty bird... How could you?<br> She can't be dead!<br> Misery Chastain cannot be dead!<br> Annie, in 1871<br> women often died in childbirth.<br> Her spirit is the important thing.<br> Misery's spirit is still alive.<br> I don't want her spirit! I want her!<br> And you murdered her!<br> No... I didn't.<br> Who did?<br> No one. She... she died,<br> she just slipped away.<br> Slipped away? Slipped away?<br> She didn't just slip away! You did it!<br> You did it! You did it!<br> You did it! You did it!<br> You murdered my Misery!<br> Annie...<br> I thought you were good, Paul.<br> But you're not good.<br> You're just another lying old dirty birdie.<br> And I don't think I better<br> be around you for a while.<br> And don't even think<br> about anybody coming for you.<br> Not the doctors, not your agent, not<br> your family, because I never called them.<br> Nobody knows you're here.<br> And you better hope<br> nothing happens to me.<br> Because if I die... you die.<br> (door closes)<br> (another door closes)<br> (engine starts)<br> Agh!<br> No, Miz Sindell, there's no point<br> in comin' up here now.<br> Everything that can be done is.<br> Yes, we're working close with the state<br> police and the FBI's been informed.<br> Right. Right. As soon as we know<br> anything, we'll let you know.<br> No bother at all. Call any time.<br> Bye, Miz Sindell.<br> All right. Well, I sure<br> appreciate it. Thank you.<br> Accordin' to Sheldon's credit charges,<br> there's nothing after the Silver Creek.<br> And no calls about the article, either.<br> You poor, dear thing.<br> What are you doing on the floor?<br> It's all my fault.<br> If I'd had a proper hospital bed<br> this never would've happened.<br> Here, let me help you back in.<br> (Paul groans)<br> I know this hurts,<br> but it'll only take a few seconds.<br> Upsy-daisy!<br> Oh... Ow...<br> - Oh, please, wait, wait...<br> - Oh, you're such a crybaby.<br> Agh...<br> There you go. Comfy?<br> - Perfect.<br> - You're such a kidder.<br> I have a big surprise for you.<br> But first there's something you must do.<br> You don't suppose I could have a little<br> snack while I'm waiting for the surprise?<br> I'll get you everything you want,<br> but you must listen first.<br> Sometimes my thinking<br> is a little muddy, I accept that.<br> It's why I couldn't remember all they<br> asked me on the witness stand in Denver.<br> But this time I thought clearly.<br> I asked God about you...<br> ...and God said "I delivered him unto you<br> so that you may show him the way."<br> - Show me the way?<br> - Yes.<br> When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking<br> more on the lines of cheese and crackers.<br> Paul, this is no time for jokes.<br> You must rid the world of this filth.<br> You want me to burn my book?<br> I know this may be difficult for you,<br> but it's for the best.<br> It's really not difficult at all.<br> My agent made dozens of copies.<br> There's gonna be an auction in New York.<br> Every publishing house in New York<br> is reading it now.<br> So if you want me to burn my book, fine.<br> You're not ridding the world of anything.<br> Then light the match, Paul.<br> It's no big deal.<br> So you've indicated. Do it.<br> I know it's the only copy. When you wrote<br> your first book you didn't make a copy...<br> ...because you didn't think anybody<br> would take it seriously.<br> Now you never make copies<br> because you're superstitious.<br> It's why you always<br> come back to Silver Creek.<br> You told that story to Merv Griffin<br> Merv Griffin...<br> I'll tell you what. It doesn't ever have to be<br> published. No one ever has to read it.<br> I'll just keep it for myself.<br> No one will even know it exists.<br> As long as it does exist,<br> your mind won't ever be free.<br> I think you should light the match, Paul.<br> Can't you see it's what God wants?<br> You're so brilliant I would think<br> you'd certainly be able to see that.<br> We're put on this earth<br> to help people, Paul.<br> Like I'm trying to help you.<br> Please... help me help you.<br> You're doing the right thing.<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> Goodness gracious! Oh, my...<br> Oh, goodness! Heavens to Betsy!<br> Oh, goodness! Oh, my goodness!<br> Heavens to Betsy! Oh, goodness!<br> Well, isn't that an oogy mess?<br> (helicopter)<br> That's the Steadman place down there.<br> And that's the Wilkes farm straight ahead.<br> That's no '65 Mustang.<br> There's nothing else out this way.<br> Let's circle back.<br> I do believe the winters are getting<br> shorter and shorter every year.<br> People say it has something to do<br> with the ozone layer. What do you think?<br> I don't know.<br> Yeah, well, it's a theory.<br> Here's your Novril.<br> We're back. Now, you'll have<br> to remind us who the audience chose.<br> They chose Kevin.<br> Congratulations, Kevin Andrews!<br> - Hi, Kevin.<br> - How you doin', Chuck?<br> Make yourself at home back there,<br> and Sheree will tell us about the date.<br> OK, first of all I picked out<br> a very classy restaurant.<br> It was so classy,<br> and he shows up without no tie...<br> See, isn't this nice?<br> Great. I always wanted to visit<br> the other side of the room.<br> Ooh, and look what I got for you.<br> An electric razor,<br> so you can shave yourself now.<br> (razor buzzes)<br> If I knew this was the surprise<br> I'd have burned all my books.<br> Now, don't poke fun!<br> This is a very big day for you, Paul. You<br> just sit tight and I'll set everything up.<br> - Set what up?<br> - That's the big surprise.<br> Your new studio.<br> After all, writers do need a place to work.<br> Work? You mean write?<br> What in the world do you think I'd write?<br> Oh, but, Paul, I don't think. I know.<br> Now you've gotten rid<br> of that manuscript...<br> ...you can go back<br> to doing what you're great at.<br> You're gonna write a new novel,<br> your greatest achievement ever.<br> Misery's Return.<br> Misery's Return?<br> I know you didn't mean it when you killed<br> her, and now you'll make it right.<br> It'll be a book in my honour, for saving<br> your life and nursing you back to health.<br> Oh, Paul, you're gonna make me<br> the envy of the whole world!<br> You just expect me to whip<br> something off, is that it?<br> I expect nothing less<br> than your masterpiece.<br> You do understand that this is not the<br> ordinary way in which books get written.<br> I mean, some people might actually<br> consider this an oddball situation.<br> I have total confidence in your brilliance.<br> Besides, the view will inspire you.<br> You just inhale that. I'll be right back.<br> I guess you don't get bothered<br> by neighbours much.<br> Don't worry, you'll have total solitude<br> so you can concentrate on your work.<br> Great.<br> I got you this expensive<br> paper to type on...<br> ...and I got a great deal on this 50lb<br> clunker on account of it's missing an N.<br> I told the saleslady N was one of the<br> letters in my favourite writer's name.<br> It's two of the letters<br> in my favourite nurse's name, A-nn-ie.<br> You fooler! Did I do good?<br> You did great.<br> There is just one little thing. Uh...<br> I can't work on this paper. See,<br> it's Corrasable Bond. It smudges.<br> So I thought maybe,<br> if you went back into town...<br> ...you could bring me<br> some white long-grain mimeo.<br> But mine cost the most,<br> so I don't see how it can smudge.<br> Come here, I'll show you.<br> Oh... It does smudge after all.<br> Isn't that fascinating.<br> I thought you'd be interested.<br> I'd like for you to be<br> in on everything, Annie...<br> ...not just the finished book,<br> but how it's written.<br> Thank you for thinking of me.<br> Anything else I can get while I'm in town?<br> Any other crucial requirements<br> that need satisfying?<br> Would you like a tiny tape recorder?<br> Or how about a handmade set<br> of writing slippers?<br> No, just the paper will be fine.<br> Are you sure? Cos if you want<br> I'll bring back the whole store for you.<br> Annie, uh, what's the matter?<br> I'll tell you what's the matter!<br> I go out of my way for you! I do<br> everything to try and make you happy!<br> I feed you, I clean you, I dress you,<br> and what thanks do I get?<br> "Oh, you bought the wrong paper, Annie.<br> I can't write on this, Annie!"<br> Well, I'll get your stupid paper,<br> but you better show me...<br> ...a little more appreciation, Mister Man!<br> Agh!<br> (locks door)<br> Shit.<br> Come on...<br> Come on, you've written<br> about this, now do it.<br> (click)<br> What do you know? It actually works.<br> What a surprise.<br> You crazy bitch.<br> Agh!<br> (car approaches)<br> (click)<br> Paul, I've got your paper.<br> I hope it's enough.<br> It's three reams of long-grain mimeo.<br> Just the kind you asked for.<br> Paul! You're dripping with perspiration.<br> Your colour is very hectic.<br> What have you been doing?<br> You know damn well what I've been<br> doing. I've been sitting here suffering.<br> I need my pills.<br> Poor dear. Let's get you back in bed<br> and I'll get them for you.<br> I want my pills now!<br> - It'll only take a second.<br> - No!<br> I want my pain to go away, Annie.<br> Please, make it go away.<br> Please, Annie.<br> Please.<br> It just breaks my heart to see you like this.<br> I've done a lot of thinking<br> on the drive... Here you go.<br> And I'm absolutely certain the main<br> reason I've never been more popular...<br> ...is because of my temper.<br> You must be so mad at me.<br> The truth now.<br> Well... Who doesn't let off<br> a little steam every once in a while?<br> My genius needs his rest before he writes.<br> (hums)<br> Footsies up.<br> There you go.<br> Here. In case you think of any ideas.<br> Well, I wouldn't expect too much.<br> Don't be silly! You'll be brilliant.<br> Think of me as your inspiration.<br> I have faith in you, my darling.<br> Catch this...<br> My darling.<br> The presumption must now be<br> that Paul Sheldon is dead.<br> We know he somehow managed<br> to crawl outside his vehicle...<br> ...but we have been unable to find his body<br> in the vicinity of the accident.<br> We also know if anyone had found him<br> they'd have taken him to an area hospital.<br> Undoubtedly he is buried<br> somewhere out there in the snow.<br> We'll find him after the first thaw.<br> That is, unless the animals got to him<br> first, which is a distinct possibility.<br> That was a statement from Colorado<br> Police Chief Sherman Douglas.<br> You don't think he's dead, do you?<br> Well, he might well be,<br> but not the way they say.<br> He never crawled out<br> of that car by himself.<br> You can see the dents on the door there.<br> Someone pulled him out.<br> I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong.<br> - What?<br> - You'll have to do it over again.<br> It's not worthy of you. Throw it all out.<br> Except for naming the gravedigger<br> after me - you can leave that in.<br> I really value your criticism,<br> but maybe we're being a little hasty here.<br> Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.<br> - Not fair?<br> - That's right.<br> When I was growing up in Bakersfield<br> my favourite thing...<br> ...was to go to the movies on Saturdays<br> for the chapter plays.<br> - Cliffhangers.<br> - I know that, Mister Man!<br> They also call them serials.<br> I'm not stupid, you know!<br> Anyway, my favourite was Rocket Man,<br> and once it was a no-brakes chapter.<br> The bad guys stuck him in a car<br> on a mountain road, knocked him out...<br> ...tore out the brakes<br> and started him to his death.<br> And he woke up and tried to get out...<br> ...but the car went off a cliff before he<br> could escape, and crashed and burned...<br> ...and I was so upset and excited!<br> And the next week I was first in line.<br> They start with the end of the last week...<br> ...and there was Rocket Man trying<br> to get out, and here comes the cliff...<br> ...and just before the car went off the cliff<br> he jumped free, and all the kids cheered!<br> But I didn't cheer.<br> I stood right up and started shouting...<br> ..."This isn't what happened last week!<br> Have you all got amnesia?"<br> "They just cheated us! This isn't fair!<br> He didn't get out of the cockadoodie car!"<br> They always cheated like that<br> in cl... chapter plays.<br> But not you. Not with my Misery.<br> Lan did ride for Dr Cleary at the end<br> of the last book, but his horse fell...<br> ...and lan broke his shoulder and ribs<br> and never reached the doctor...<br> ...so there couldn't be any experimental<br> blood transfusion that saved her life.<br> Misery was buried in the ground at the<br> end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.<br> Is it fair? Should I continue?<br> You better!<br> Oh, Paul! When lan realised that<br> the reason they'd buried Misery alive...<br> ...was because the bee sting<br> had put her in that coma!<br> And Gravedigger Wilkes<br> remembered how 30 years earlier...<br> ...the same had happened<br> to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!<br> And then Dr Cleary deduced that Misery<br> must be her long-lost daughter...<br> ...because of the rarity of deadly<br> bee stings, my heart just leapt!<br> I knew from the very first book<br> that Misery had to be nobility...<br> ...and I was right!<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when<br> you're finished? I can fill in the N's.<br> Will she be her old self now lan has<br> dug her out, or will she have amnesia?<br> Have to wait.<br> Will she still love him<br> with that special, perfect love?<br> - You'll have to wait.<br> - Not even a hint?<br> Mm-mm.<br> Ohhh!<br> Misery's alive, Misery's alive!<br> Oh, it's so romantic!<br> Oh, this whole house<br> is gonna be filled with romance!<br> I'm gonna put on my Liberace records!<br> You do like Liberace, don't you?<br> Whenever he played Radio City,<br> who do you think was in the front row?<br> I'm gonna play my records all day long,<br> to inspire you. He's my all-time favourite.<br> Annie?<br> Would you have dinner with me tonight?<br> To celebrate Misery's Return.<br> I couldn't have done it without you.<br> Oh, Paul...<br> It would be an honour.<br> No, he's not here.<br> I don't know where he is.<br> He never tells me anything any more.<br> He's probably out<br> havin' an affair somewhere.<br> Wait a minute. He's comin' in now.<br> It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know<br> who you're havin' an affair with.<br> Hello, Jim. What's doin'?<br> Jim, we've been through this before.<br> If you have benches<br> in front of your store...<br> ...people are gonna want to sit on 'em.<br> Well, I don't like him either, but I'm not<br> gonna come over and tell him to move.<br> Give my best to Denise. Bye.<br> Well, whoever she is,<br> she sure likes to read a lot.<br> Virginia, I'm flattered that<br> you think I've got that much energy.<br> I figured that if I can't find Paul Sheldon...<br> ...at least I can find out<br> what he wrote about.<br> What d'you expect to find? A story about<br> a guy who drove off a cliff in a storm?<br> You see, it's just that kind of sarcasm<br> that's given our marriage real spice.<br> (Liberace) I'll be seeing you<br> In all the old familiar places...<br> - I hope you like it.<br> - It looks wonderful.<br> So do you.<br> Mm...<br> I've never had meatloaf this good.<br> What do you do to it?<br> My secret is I only use<br> fresh tomatoes, never canned.<br> And to give it that extra zip I mix in<br> some Spam with the ground beef.<br> Ah...<br> Can't get this in a restaurant in New York.<br> - Let's have a toast.<br> - A toast?<br> Yes. To, um... to Misery.<br> Let me pour you some wine.<br> Oh...<br> Whoa...<br> No...<br> To Misery.<br> Wait. Let's do this right.<br> Do you have any candles?<br> Oh, um...<br> I don't know. I... I think so.<br> I'll go look.<br> Did you study decorating<br> or do you just have a flair?<br> Oh, you!<br> I just picked things up over the years.<br> Well, it certainly says you.<br> - You really think so?<br> - Oh, absolutely.<br> Listen, if you can't find any, it's OK.<br> I just thought it'd be nice.<br> Are you kidding? If anyone<br> had ever told me that one day...<br> ...l'd be having a candlelit dinner<br> with Paul Sheldon in my own house...<br> ...I woulda checked both legs<br> to see which one was bein' pulled!<br> Will this do?<br> It's perfect.<br> To Misery... and to Annie Wilkes,<br> who brought her back to life.<br> Oh, Paul! I get goose bumps<br> every time I think about it!<br> Oh...<br> Oh, my God, what have I done?<br> Oh, I'm so sorry, Paul!<br> I ruined your beautiful toast!<br> Will you ever forgive me?<br> Here, let me pour another one.<br> Can we pretend this never happened?<br> To Misery.<br> To Misery.<br> (Tchaikovsky "Piano Concerto No. 1",<br> performed by Liberace)<br> (typing)<br> (typing continues)<br> Paul, this is positively<br> the best Misery you've ever written.<br> (thunderclap)<br> Here's your pills.<br> Annie?<br> Annie, what is it?<br> The rain.<br> Sometimes it gives me the blues.<br> When you first came here... I only loved<br> the writer part of Paul Sheldon.<br> But now I know I love the rest of him, too.<br> I know you don't love me.<br> Don't say you do.<br> You're a beautiful, brilliant,<br> famous man of the world...<br> ...and I'm... not a movie-star type.<br> You'll never know the fear<br> of losing someone like you...<br> ...if you're someone like me.<br> Why would you lose me?<br> The book's almost finished.<br> Your legs are getting better.<br> Soon you'll be wanting to leave.<br> Why would I leave? I like it here.<br> That's very kind of you,<br> but I'll bet it's not altogether true.<br> I have this gun.<br> Sometimes I think about using it.<br> I better go now.<br> I might put bullets in it.<br> "There is a justice higher than<br> that of man. I will be judged by him."<br> What?<br> They're haulin' Misery into court.<br> That's nice.<br> There is a justice...<br> higher than that of man.<br> I will be judged... by him.<br> (car approaches)<br> (footsteps)<br> (front door opens)<br> (door closes)<br> (TV on)<br> See you in the morning.<br> (rain)<br> (audience applause)<br> (Liberace) I'm supposed to lead<br> into the finale of my show right now...<br> ...but I'm having such a wonderful time...<br> Paul.<br> Hm?<br> I know you've been out.<br> What?<br> You've been out of your room.<br> No, I haven't.<br> Paul, my little ceramic penguin<br> in the study always faces due south.<br> I don't... I don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> Ceramic penguin?<br> Is this what you're looking for?<br> I know you've been out twice, Paul.<br> At first I couldn't figure out how you did it,<br> but last night... I found your key.<br> I know I left my scrapbook out.<br> I can imagine what<br> you might be thinking of me.<br> But you see, Paul, it's all OK.<br> Last night it came so clear.<br> I realise you just need more time.<br> Eventually you'll come to accept<br> the idea of being here.<br> Paul, do you know about the early days<br> at the Kimberley diamond mines?<br> Do you know what they did to<br> the native workers who stole diamonds?<br> Don't worry. They didn't kill them.<br> That would be like junking a Mercedes<br> just because it had a broken spring.<br> No, they had to make sure<br> they could go on working...<br> ...but they also had to make sure<br> they could never run away.<br> The operation was called "hobbling".<br> Annie... Whatever you're thinking<br> about doing, please don't do it.<br> - Annie, for God's...<br> - Shh, darling. Trust me.<br> God's sake!<br> - It's for the best.<br> - Annie, please!<br> Agh!<br> Almost done. Just one more.<br> Agh!<br> God, I love you.<br> (tyres screech)<br> (horn)<br> You cockadoodie!<br> - (man) Turn on this!<br> - (Annie) You poop!<br> - Just leave it, all right?<br> - Oh, I like that tone!<br> How many times must I tell you? I have a<br> system here! Where the hell is that thing?<br> - What thing?<br> - The thing!<br> - Here it is, where it's supposed to be.<br> - What is it?<br> I'm not sure. Maybe nothin'.<br> - Well, I'm glad you found it.<br> - There's that spice again.<br> (Annie) Come on, Misie. Come on.<br> Hi, punkin.<br> Such a kidder! Come on, Misery.<br> Come on, Misie.<br> - Hey, Pete.<br> - Buster.<br> - Answer me a couple of things.<br> - If I can.<br> Do you have any new<br> Paul Sheldon books?<br> Well, we had a batch.<br> Sold 'em all out in three days.<br> You wouldn't happen to know<br> if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?<br> Are you kiddin'? Every time<br> that fella writes a new book...<br> ...she has me set aside the first copy.<br> Has she been buyin' anything odd lately?<br> Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.<br> Lest you call paper odd.<br> - Newspaper?<br> - No. The typin' kind.<br> Oh, that kind. Nothin' odd about that.<br> - Miz Wilkes done somethin'?<br> - Not a thing.<br> (car approaches)<br> (footsteps)<br> Agh!<br> I don't think I'll ever understand you.<br> I cook your meals...<br> ...I tend to you<br> practically 24 hours a day...<br> ...and you continue to fight me. When<br> are we going to develop a sense of trust?<br> Oh, my!<br> Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,<br> but you didn't give me a chance to knock.<br> I guess you can tell I'm not all that used<br> to visitors. What can I do for you?<br> Well, I was wonderin', do you happen<br> to know anything about Paul Sheldon?<br> What do you want to know?<br> Well, anything you could<br> tell me might help.<br> Well, he was born in Worcester,<br> Massachusetts, 45 years ago...<br> ...the only child of Franklin and<br> Helene Sheldon, mediocre student...<br> That isn't exactly the kinda<br> information I'm after.<br> See, he's been missin'<br> for some time now, and...<br> I know. It's so upsetting.<br> I'm his number one fan.<br> I've got all his books.<br> Every sentence he ever put down.<br> I'm so proud<br> of my Paul Sheldon collection.<br> Well, here I am prattling on<br> and my manners have just flown away.<br> I haven't invited you in. Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Of course, you must know<br> about that horrible accident.<br> - Mind if I take a look around?<br> - Of course not.<br> That accident almost killed me, too.<br> I prayed when I heard the news.<br> I got down on my knees<br> and I begged for it not to be true.<br> You're gonna laugh at what I'm about<br> to say, but go ahead, I don't care.<br> When I was praying,<br> God told me to get ready.<br> - Get ready for what?<br> - To be his replacement.<br> He gave so much pleasure<br> to so many people...<br> ...and there's a shortage of pleasure<br> on the planet these days...<br> ...in case you hadn't noticed.<br> God told me,<br> since I was his number one fan...<br> ...that I should make up new stories<br> as if I was Paul Sheldon.<br> So I went to town, and I bought<br> a typewriter, and paper to type on...<br> ...the same kind Paul Sheldon used.<br> And I turned the guest bedroom into<br> a writing studio. Would you like to see it?<br> - Sure.<br> - It's right this way.<br> I know how he wrote. The kinds of words<br> he used, the wonderful stories he told...<br> I've spent the last four weeks<br> trying to write like Paul Sheldon...<br> ...but I can't do it right.<br> I try and I try, and I know all the words,<br> but it's just not the same.<br> Well, maybe it takes a while<br> to get the hang of it.<br> I could give you a coupla hundred pages<br> and you could tell me what you think.<br> I'm not much of a critic.<br> Well, I just thought...<br> Oh, you'd think I'd never had a guest<br> before! Would you like a cup of cocoa?<br> - No, really, I don't...<br> - It's no trouble.<br> There's some already made.<br> Must get lonely,<br> livin' out here all by yourself.<br> Well, if you can't enjoy<br> your own company...<br> ...you're not fit company for anyone else.<br> Well, you've got a point there.<br> (both chuckle)<br> Here you are.<br> Well, thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't<br> wanna take up any more of your time.<br> I best be goin'.<br> But you didn't even taste your cocoa.<br> I'm sure it's wonderful,<br> but I really should be gettin' back.<br> If you wouldn't mind, perhaps I could<br> pay you another visit sometime.<br> I'd be delighted.<br> Now that you know the way.<br> (clanking)<br> Miz Wilkes?<br> Miz Wilkes, are you all right?<br> (Paul) Here!<br> Here! I'm down here!<br> I'm down here!<br> Mr Sheldon?<br> Don't feel bad, Paul.<br> It was bound to happen<br> sooner or later. It's a sign.<br> You see, I've known for some time<br> why I was chosen to save you.<br> You and I were meant<br> to be together for ever.<br> But now our time in this world must end.<br> But don't worry, Paul.<br> I've prepared for what must be done.<br> I put two bullets in my gun,<br> one for you and one for me.<br> Oh, darling, it'll be so beautiful.<br> (footsteps)<br> Now don't be afraid.<br> I love you.<br> I love you, too.<br> And you're right.<br> We are meant to be together.<br> And I know we must die.<br> But it must be... so that Misery can live.<br> We have the power<br> to give Misery eternal life.<br> We must finish the book.<br> But the time is now.<br> Soon others will come.<br> It's almost finished.<br> By dawn...<br> ...we'll be able to give Misery...<br> back to the world.<br> I'll fix you something to eat.<br> Oh, Paul, I'm dying! Does she<br> wind up with lan or Windthorne?<br> You'll know very soon.<br> I've just started the last chapter.<br> You know... when I finish...<br> I'd like everything to be perfect.<br> I'll need three things.<br> What things?<br> You mean you don't know?<br> I was foolin', silly.<br> You need a cigarette, because<br> you used to smoke but quit...<br> ...except when you finish a book,<br> and you have just one.<br> And the match is to light it, and you need<br> one glass of champagne, Dom Perig-non.<br> Dom Perig-non it is.<br> Annie?<br> Annie!<br> Yes, Paul?<br> I'm almost done.<br> Oh, Paul, this is so romantic!<br> Lan and Windthorne duelling<br> for the right to Misery's hand.<br> Does lan win? Oh, don't tell me...<br> It's Windthorne, right?<br> You'll know everything in a minute.<br> Get the champagne.<br> Oh...
