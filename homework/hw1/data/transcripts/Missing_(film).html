The<br> owner is more dangerous than his dogs.<br> Fuck!<br> Damn, she's pretty<br> Have you seen her?<br> I've never seen her<br> A few days ago I think she went by here<br> People always come by here<br> and don't give me a second look<br> How do you expect me<br> to remember them all?<br> Excuse me, sir<br> Do you know of any<br> restaurant around here?<br> Yeah, there's a place up there<br> It's been a while since<br> it's operated though<br> Really?<br> Thank You<br> Boy, I'd love to have a piece of her<br> Come on, eat it<br> Do you want to starve to death?<br> You didn't complain when I saved<br> you, so why do you do this now?<br> Does it bother you<br> that your son is happy?<br> No, you can't ever die<br> You need to live to see<br> your son lead a happy life<br> Excuse me<br> Is anybody there?<br> Anybody there?<br> Hello, who are you?<br> Who are you? I'm the owner here<br> Oh I'm sorry, it looks<br> like I trespassed here<br> It's alright, that happens sometimes<br> But why are you here?<br> I'm looking for somebody<br> Have you by anychance seen this girl?<br> You've seen her before?<br> I've never seen her before<br> Who is she?<br> She's my younger sister<br> Why are you looking for her here?<br> A few days ago she told me she was<br> going to have dinner around here...<br> ...I haven't heard from her since<br> You came to the wrong place. It's been<br> a while since we've even been open.<br> One moment sir!<br> I saw a sign for the<br> restaurant out front.<br> Aren't there any people that<br> come here because of the sign?<br> In the past people used to come,<br> but nobody has been here these days<br> It's her again<br> Did you come looking for me?<br> I have to ask you something<br> It's seems you're<br> around here often so...<br> ...have you seen this girl?<br> She's so pretty!<br> Have you seen her?<br> No, I don't think so<br> Who is it?<br> My sister<br> Why are you looking for her here?<br> I had a hunch<br> Wait a second!<br> Was she together with a guy?<br> I think so<br> Like a week ago, no 10 days ago?<br> That's right<br> Nice car, killer body,<br> I remember her now!<br> Where did you see her?<br> I saw her in front of that guy's house<br> Are you sure?<br> I'm sure. They say I'm stupid but<br> my memory is actually pretty good.<br> Thank you so much<br> I wonder what's going on? Did that<br> old bastard do something again?<br> Kidnapping?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Do you want to go to jail?<br> Send me to jail if you want,<br> but please just listen to me<br> Listen, do you have<br> any idea who Pan-gon is?<br> He lives only with his mother<br> and he's kind to everybody.<br> Sheriff, haven't you<br> seen the news lately? Lots<br> of kind people have<br> been doing bad things...<br> ..So please That's enough!<br> Stop talking and please leave.<br> Sheriff! Stop, let's do it like this...<br> I will go to Pan-gon's<br> house together with her...<br> ...If something bad happens, I<br> will take responsibility for it<br> We're going because of you so you<br> better take full responsibility<br> Don't worry!<br> Dumbass...<br> Who knows what we're<br> getting ourselves into<br> But Sheriff What?<br> Mr. Pan-gon seems like a normal<br> guy. Why does he live by himself?<br> He hasn't always been that way. It's<br> probably because of women troubles.<br> What do you mean?<br> A few years ago, his wife ran off<br> Really? Why?<br> How the hell am I supposed to know?<br> It was a pretty big deal at the time.<br> So did they find her?<br> If they found her, would<br> he still live alone?<br> Sir, if there's nothing in the<br> basement, why can't we search it?<br> I understand you must not like this, but<br> stop making a fuss out of something so small<br> Wait, Mr. Pan-gon!<br> You do it<br> Pan-gon! Hey!<br> Where the hell did he go?<br> Hmm, is there something in here?<br> Over Here! Over here! Look at this<br> What the hell is that?<br> It smells terrible.<br> So that's why?<br> I caught it myself...<br> ...but it's illegal isn't it?<br> So that's why you<br> wouldn't give us the key?<br> I was going to use it to catch kitchens.<br> I'm sorry<br> That's alright. This little punk<br> always thinks the worst of people...<br> Officer Kim, get out of there now!<br> Aren't you leaving? Is there<br> something else you want to see?<br> No, let's go<br> It's a little old...<br> ...But maybe it will still work<br> Hyeon-ah, today I bought you a scarf and I<br> did your hair for you. What do you have to say?<br> My sister is the best!<br> I'm sorry, I'll get it<br> done by the end of the week<br> It's just 200 1-piece suits.<br> I can get that done easily.<br> I'm coming to Seoul right now<br> so let's speak when I arrive<br> Are you alright?<br> What the fuck!?<br> Mr. Pan-gon!<br> You're the one from yesterday<br> Are you ok? You're not hurt are you?<br> I'm fine...but my eggs are ruined<br> I'm so sorry<br> It was partially my fault<br> Mr. Pan-gon, please let<br> me take you to the hospital<br> No, it costs too much money<br> Still, you should get checked out<br> Hey, did your sister wear a necklace?<br> You mean a heart-shaped necklace?<br> That's right, one that looks like that<br> What about that necklace?<br> A few days ago, I found that necklace<br> outside of the dog keeper's house<br> Really?<br> I was going to tell you<br> but I forgot about it<br> Do you have that necklace<br> with you right now?<br> No, it's at my house<br> Would it be ok if I go<br> to your house to get it?<br> I guess you could stop by<br> Thank You<br> You remember where I live right? Yes<br> What can I do for you at this late hour?<br> Where is the sheriff?<br> He went home already.<br> I'm on the late shift.<br> What's this?<br> I came out to buy some medicine for my<br> mother, but then I thought of you guys<br> You don't need to do this<br> for us; it's such a hassle<br> It's no problem, don't worry about<br> I'll see you<br> OK, take care<br> Oh, that woman from yesterday.<br> Did she find her sister?<br> I don't know. We haven't had<br> any contact from her since then.<br> She must have gone back to Seoul<br> Oh I see<br> If she stayed a little longer,<br> I probably could have helped more<br> You must have a crush on her<br> What? No way!<br> Alright, I'll see ya<br> Work hard<br> She was pretty hot...<br> ...The perfect style for me<br> Save your strength;<br> you'll only hurt yourself<br> I can't have my baby getting hurt...<br> Is this it?<br> I didn't think it would be so easy<br> Aren't you smarter than this?<br> Do you have something to say?<br> My sister, where is my sister?<br> Is she still alive?<br> This place...isn't it too<br> small to hold two people?<br> So then...<br> I killed her<br> What?<br> You son of a bitch!<br> I'm going to kill you!<br> I'm going to kill you!<br> You son of a bitch! I'll kill you!<br> why are you so loud?<br> Just shut up already<br> I've liked you since I first saw you<br> So much softer and<br> nicer than your sister's<br> You're sister is young<br> so she's not that skilled<br> Don't worry, I'm a nice guy!<br> What, you don't like older men?<br> Stop worrying about it, you'll enjoy it<br> Eventually you're going to like me<br> Sheriff's office, this is Officer Kim<br> A silver vehicle?<br> Are you sure about that?
