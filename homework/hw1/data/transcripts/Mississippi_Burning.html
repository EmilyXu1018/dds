Pass me.<br> - Is it a cop?<br> - I can't see.<br> - What the fuck are they playin' at?<br> - They ain't playin'. You better believe it.<br> - What are we gonna do?<br> - I don't know.<br> OK. Hold on, you guys.<br> There's a truck too.<br> Shit. It is a cop.<br> You better stop.<br> OK. Sit tight, you guys.<br> Don't say anything. Let me talk.<br> All right? We'll be all right. Just relax.<br> Y'all think you can drive<br> any speed you want around here?<br> You had us scared to death, man.<br> - Don't you call me "man", Jew-boy.<br> - No, sir. What should I call you?<br> You don't call me nothin',<br> nigger-lovin' Jew-boy. You just listen.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hell, you even startin' to smell<br> like a nigger, Jew-boy.<br> - Take it easy. We'll be all right.<br> - Sure you will, nigger-lover.<br> (cop) He's seen your face. That ain't good.<br> You don't want him seein' your face.<br> Oh, it don't make no difference no more.<br> (click)<br> - Whoa, shit! We into it now, boys.<br> - (three gunshots)<br> You only left me a nigger,<br> but at least I shot me a nigger.<br> (men laugh)<br> Yes, indeed.<br> # Now listen,<br> you communists and niggers and Jews<br> # Tell all your buddies to spread the news<br> # Your Day of Judgment will soon be nigh<br> # As the Lord in his wisdom<br> looks down from on high<br> # Will his battle be lost<br> by mixin' the races?<br> # We want beautiful babies,<br> not ones with brown faces<br> # Never, never, never, I say<br> # For the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay<br> # Never, never, never, I say<br> # Cos the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay<br> These Ku Kluxers are better<br> with lynchings than with lyrics.<br> Just read the file, Mr. Anderson.<br> I can do without the cabaret.<br> - You don't like me much, do you, boss?<br> - Sure I like you.<br> I just don't share your sense of humor.<br> Sometimes that's all you got left.<br> - How long you been in the Bureau?<br> - Three years.<br> - Right outta college, huh?<br> - No. From the Justice Department.<br> Kennedy boy. Now I see.<br> No. I don't think you do see.<br> Let's get this thing straight.<br> I haven't had a pimple in years.<br> I shave every morning.<br> I even go to the bathroom by myself.<br> So you can quit this "boss" stuff.<br> I'm in charge because<br> I've been through this before.<br> - Birmingham? Montgomery?<br> - Oxford. I was with Meredith at Old Miss.<br> Oh. You got hit in the head with a brick,<br> so they gave you a promotion.<br> No. Shot in the shoulder.<br> - Well, at least you lived. That's important.<br> - Meredith lived. That's what's important.<br> What's got four eyes and can't see?<br> - What?<br> - Mississippi.<br> # Never, never, never, I say<br> # Cos the Ku Klux Klan is here to...<br> (laughs)<br> - Big building for a small town.<br> - Yeah.<br> Howdy.<br> Good morning. My name's Alan Ward.<br> I'm with the FBI.<br> Federal Bureau of Integration?<br> - In that get-up, you ain't undercover.<br> - We're here to see Sheriff Stuckey.<br> Sheriff's right busy now.<br> You'll have to wait<br> or come back some other time.<br> We'll wait.<br> (sighs)<br> Listen to me,<br> you backwoods shit-ass, you.<br> You got two seconds to get the sheriff out<br> here or I'll kick the goddamn door in. OK?<br> (door opens)<br> Well, hell.<br> Looks like we got some company.<br> Some Hoover boys come down to visit.<br> - How ya doin'?<br> - Good.<br> - I'm Sheriff Stuckey.<br> - Rupert Anderson.<br> Rupert, we've been expectin' you.<br> - I assume you met my deputy, Mr. Pell.<br> - Sure did.<br> You down here to help us<br> solve our nigger problems?<br> No. It's just a missing-person case.<br> Well, come on.<br> - You gonna want your boy in on this?<br> - Sheriff...<br> I'm Special Agent Ward<br> and I'm in charge of this case.<br> We think it might be a little<br> more serious than missing persons.<br> I don't think so, boy.<br> Know what I think it is?<br> It's a publicity stunt cooked up<br> by that Martin Luther King fella.<br> (chuckles) Come on.<br> At around 3pm, Deputy Pell says<br> he arrested the three boys for speeding.<br> He held them in jail until 10pm<br> and then released them.<br> They drove off. He says he followed them<br> as far as the county line...<br> ...and never saw them again.<br> Why didn't they make a phone call?<br> - Why should they?<br> - These boys were trained activists.<br> They're taught to check in every hour and,<br> if arrested, the moment they're released.<br> The hotel is near the jail. They could've<br> phoned from the lobby. It doesn't follow.<br> - (Anderson) Maybe they had a beer.<br> - Not these boys.<br> The civil rights office in Rossville started<br> making calls when they didn't check in.<br> The sheriff's office here said<br> they had no idea where the boys were.<br> First lie.<br> By who?<br> Sheriff's office or civil rights office?<br> Who would you believe?<br> Mr. Ward, I was a sheriff in a little<br> Mississippi town just like this.<br> - Yes, I'm aware of that.<br> - Well, lyin' just don't come into it.<br> We were ten miles from Memphis,<br> a million miles from the rest of the world.<br> If a sheriff in a town like this says that's<br> what happened, that's what happened.<br> Let's go eat.<br> We're full up, honey.<br> Y'all wanna wait a while?<br> - Is the wait worth it?<br> - We're not full for nothin', sugar.<br> Y'all wanna look at a menu<br> while you wait?<br> Thank you.<br> Well, what y'all gonna do? Wait or leave?<br> We're gonna wait<br> cos we wanna be near you.<br> - There are some empty seats down there.<br> - Uh, Mr. Ward...<br> That's colored down there.<br> Don't even think about it.<br> - People here are gettin' ready to leave.<br> - Aren't you hungry, Mr. Anderson?<br> Good afternoon. Looks good.<br> Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?<br> I'm looking for some information.<br> - I ain't got nothin' to say to you, sir.<br> - Just a few questions.<br> I ain't got nothin' to say to you, sir.<br> The civil rights boys came to propose<br> setting up a voter registration clinic.<br> Before the locals got a chance to say yes,<br> the Klan burned 'em down.<br> - You give a man a vote but he can't use it.<br> - Yeah, that's the way it works.<br> What did their office in Rossville say?<br> That the boys came back here<br> to apologize to the congregation.<br> "Sorry you folks didn't get to vote. "<br> "I suppose most of you<br> never knew you even had one. "<br> "Now you got no place to go on Sunday. "<br> Apparently, after they came back here,<br> they talked to some locals down the road.<br> - I think that's where we should start.<br> - Oh, they won't talk to you.<br> These people have to live here<br> long after we're gone.<br> They'd rather bite their tongue off<br> than talk to us.<br> Bureau procedure, Mr. Anderson.<br> (Ward) The church caught fire<br> and you ran home. Is that correct?<br> Yes, sir.<br> And then the four white men<br> stopped you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> And these four white men<br> attacked your husband?<br> Yes, sir.<br> But you can't identify them.<br> No, sir.<br> Did you report this to the police?<br> No, sir.<br> But you told the civil rights boys<br> what happened?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Ma'am, did they tell you<br> where they were going after that?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Nothing?<br> No, sir.<br> All right. Thank you, ma'am.<br> You're welcome.<br> (pounding on door)<br> - Come on, boy.<br> - Open up.<br> - Your brother Hollis here, Fennis?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Well, wake his ass up. We wanna see him.<br> - Why?<br> - Just wake him up, boy.<br> - What is it?<br> - There you are, nigger trash!<br> Come here, boy!<br> Hollis! Hollis!<br> Get your ass back here,<br> you fuckin' nigger!<br> Hollis! Hollis!<br> We better not catch you talkin' to the FBI.<br> Or you'll be dead, boy. Real dead.<br> You admire these kids, don't you?<br> Don't you?<br> I think they're bein' used.<br> They're sent here in their<br> Volkswagens and sneakers...<br> ...just to get their heads cracked open.<br> Did it ever occur to you that maybe<br> they believed in what they were doing?<br> - Did it occur to them they'd end up dead?<br> - Maybe.<br> In Washington they sure as hell knew,<br> didn't they?<br> Some things are worth dying for.<br> Well, down here<br> they see things a little differently.<br> People down here feel<br> some things are worth killin' for.<br> Where does it come from, all this hatred?<br> You know, when I was a little boy...<br> ...there was an old Negro farmer lived<br> down the road from us, name of Monroe.<br> And he was... Well, I guess he was just<br> a little luckier than my daddy was.<br> He bought himself a mule.<br> That was a big deal around that town.<br> My daddy hated that mule.<br> His friends kidded him that they saw<br> Monroe ploughin' with his new mule...<br> ...and Monroe was gonna rent<br> another field now that he had a mule.<br> One morning that mule<br> just showed up dead.<br> They poisoned the water.<br> After that there was never any mention<br> about that mule around my daddy.<br> One time we were drivin' past<br> Monroe's place and we saw it was empty.<br> He'd just packed up and left, I guess.<br> Gone up North or somethin'.<br> I looked over at my daddy's face...<br> ...and I knew he'd done it.<br> And he saw that I knew.<br> He was ashamed.<br> I guess he was ashamed.<br> He looked at me and he said...<br> ..."If you ain't better than a nigger,<br> son, who are you better than?"<br> Do you think that's an excuse?<br> No, it's not an excuse.<br> It's just a story about my daddy.<br> Where does that leave you?<br> With an old man who was so full of hate...<br> ...that he didn't know that<br> bein' poor was what was killin' him.<br> Get the light! Get the light!<br> You all right?<br> I guess they know we're here.<br> (car engine starts)<br> (car drives off at speed)<br> Now you know what you're gettin' into.<br> I'm gonna call Washington.<br> I need more agents.<br> Would it change your mind if I say<br> that's exactly the wrong thing to do?<br> No.<br> The whole place for 75 a month.<br> It's private. It's central. It's perfect.<br> There's room for a hundred more agents.<br> Two hundred, maybe.<br> More in the balcony.<br> We're just trying to find the three boys,<br> Mr. Anderson.<br> I'll take all the help I can get.<br> When's the show start?<br> - Who's the big shot?<br> - It's the Klan.<br> No pointy hats but plenty of pointy heads.<br> Let me run a check on the plates.<br> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br> Anderson.<br> Say hello to our mayor, Mr. Tilman here.<br> - How do you do, Anderson?<br> - Mr. Mayor. Mr. Barber.<br> Well, this looks like the place to be.<br> Even for me.<br> Yep. Nothin' like a barbershop<br> for jawin' your socks off.<br> Where you from, Anderson?<br> Thornton, Mississippi, sir.<br> Just a spit from Tennessee.<br> Well, then you must know<br> how we all feel down here.<br> We don't take to outsiders<br> tellin' us how to live our lives.<br> And I'm here to tell ya,<br> our nigras were happy...<br> ...till those beatnik college kids<br> came down here stirrin' things up.<br> Before that, there wasn't<br> anybody complainin'.<br> Nobody dared.<br> We got a real peaceful<br> community down here, Anderson.<br> Course, they're just like any other folks,<br> I reckon, when you push 'em too far.<br> The way I figure it,<br> it's like three sticks of old dynamite.<br> You shake it up... and we're gonna<br> be scrapin' bodies off the street.<br> I'm just here to investigate the missing<br> three kids, ask some questions.<br> If this all boiled down to gravy...<br> ...there wouldn't be enough<br> to cover a chicken-fried steak.<br> Them kids you're lookin' for? I'd bet you a<br> shiny new dime they're in Chicago now...<br> ...drinkin' a cold beer and havin' a laugh<br> about the commotion they stirred up here.<br> Well, I sure hope so.<br> You can tell your bosses people got<br> the wrong idea about the South.<br> You know what I'm talkin' about.<br> Everybody runnin' around ragged,<br> backwards and illiterate...<br> ...eatin' sowbelly and corn pone<br> three times a day.<br> Simple fact is, Anderson,<br> we got two cultures down here.<br> White culture and a colored culture.<br> That's the way it always has been.<br> That's the way it always will be.<br> - The rest of America don't see it that way.<br> - The rest of America don't mean jack shit.<br> You in Mississippi now.<br> Oh, that's for sure!<br> (baseball on radio)<br> - What's the score, Mr. Barber?<br> - St Louis on top, five to nothing.<br> - What inning is it?<br> - Bottom of the seventh.<br> - You like baseball, Anderson?<br> - Yeah, I do. You know...<br> ...it's the only time when a black man<br> can wave a stick at a white man...<br> ...and not start a riot.<br> Sir.<br> We checked on the plate, sir.<br> Clayton Townley.<br> Townley. Grand Wizard of<br> the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.<br> That's him. And we have a lead on the car.<br> A Choctaw on the reservation<br> thinks he knows where it is.<br> Good.<br> (woman)<br> You have an appointment next Tuesday?<br> I'll see you then. Bye-bye.<br> Afternoon, ladies.<br> - Can I help you?<br> - Well, yes, you can.<br> I tell you, I just...<br> I hate the way I look. You know?<br> What do you think? A permanent wave,<br> maybe? Or a bleach job?<br> - That looks good. Was it done in here?<br> - No. Jackson.<br> A wig's your only hope, hon. You won't<br> be able to do much with that cue ball.<br> If you wanna ask us some questions,<br> this is where you'll hear it all.<br> Yeah, matter of fact, I do.<br> I was wonderin' who that gentleman was<br> that just drove in over there.<br> - I know that isn't President Johnson.<br> - His name's Townley. Clayton Townley.<br> - Are you one of them FBI gentlemen?<br> - Yes, ma'am, I am.<br> Well, I think it's a shame if those two kids<br> are dead. But I sure hope you find 'em.<br> Thank you. Actually, three kids are<br> missin'. There's a colored kid also.<br> Do you think your people'd be down here<br> if it weren't for those two white boys?<br> - Maybe not, miss.<br> - Mrs.<br> Pell. Her old man's Ray Stuckey's deputy.<br> But I'm single.<br> Move out of the way.<br> Move over, boy.<br> We'll take care of this. It's a local problem.<br> We'll handle this.<br> We don't need your damn help.<br> It ain't right havin' blood on Main Street.<br> How'd that look on the TV news?<br> - Get up.<br> - OK, I got him. I got him.<br> He's the kid from the diner.<br> Think twice before you talk to<br> colored kids with an audience.<br> They're sending a message from<br> the boss in Tupelo, and you know it.<br> I know it, yes. Clayton Townley,<br> chief pointy head.<br> Yeah, that's right.

They gonna find nothin'.<br> Civil rights leaders are optimistic<br> as to the young men's whereabouts.<br> But privately there is mounting concern<br> that they will ever be found alive.<br> They came lookin' for trouble<br> and found it.<br> This is Marek Barlbobi, Network News,<br> Jessup County, Mississippi.<br> Tell you what I think they oughta be doin'.<br> Lookin' up in Canada for them boys...<br> ...instead of our swamps around here.<br> I'll tell you somethin' else.

They were here to help you.<br> - It ain't colored folks you should talk to.<br> - Who should we talk to?<br> Come on, Aaron.<br> You should start with the sheriff's office.<br> - Why aren't you afraid?<br> - How come you ain't?<br> Aaron?<br> Here's the pitch, Swing and a line-drive<br> base hit, Another run is home,<br> On to the next pitch by the ruffled<br> Bob Gibson, He is upset,<br> Ron Hunt singled to centre,<br> Hickman passed third...<br> ... and scored the Mets' second run,<br> Hunt holds on at first,<br> and the Mets lead two to one,<br> Good evening, Mrs. Pell.

"<br> (congregation murmurs)<br> But the state of Mississippi<br> won't even allow these white boys...<br> ...to be buried in the same<br> cemetery as this Negro boy.<br> I say I have no more love to give,<br> I have only anger in my heart today...<br> ... and I want you to be angry with me!<br> Now, I am sick and I am tired...<br> ... and I want you to be<br> sick and tired with me!<br> I... I... I am sick and tired<br> of going to the funerals...<br> ... of black men who have been<br> murdered by white men!<br> I... I am sick and tired<br> of the people of this country...<br> ... who continue to allow<br> these things to happen!<br> What is an "inalienable right"<br> if you are a Negro?<br> What does it mean,<br> "equal treatment under the law"?<br> What does it mean,<br> "liberty and justice for all"?<br> Now I say to these people:<br> Look at the face of this young man<br> and you will see the face of a black man,<br> But, if you look at the bloodshed, it is red,<br> It is like yours!<br> It is just like yours!<br> You...<br> I'm gonna tell you a story.<br> A young kid named Homer Wilkes<br> lives about 30 miles north of here.<br> He'd just taken his girlfriend home<br> and was walkin' back along the road...<br> ...when a car pulled up.<br> Three white boys took him for a ride.<br> Now...<br> ...he hadn't done anything...<br> ...except...<br> ...be a Negro.<br> And they took him to a shack.<br> A shack like... like this one.<br> And they took out a razor blade...<br> ...a regular old razor blade, like this one...<br> ...and they pulled down his pants...<br> ...and they spread his legs...<br> ...and they sliced off his scrotum.<br> Put it in a coffee cup.<br> And do you know how much you bleed<br> when somebody cuts off your balls?<br> Huh?!<br> When they found Homer, he looked like<br> he'd been dipped in blood up to his waist.<br> He was barely alive when<br> they got him to the hospital.<br> He can hardly walk now.<br> Mayor, we know you know...<br> ...who was there when those three<br> civil rights boys was murdered.<br> We know you know<br> who pulled the trigger.<br> (grunts)<br> Is there somethin' you wanna say to me?<br> (Anderson) OK!<br> - Is he with the Bureau?<br> - Yeah. He's kind of a specialist.<br> - You're sure the mayor won't talk?<br> - No, they'd kill him!<br> All right. What do you have?<br> There were three cars and seven men.<br> Pell and Bailey did the killing.<br> - Sheriff Stuckey?<br> - He was too smart to be there.<br> - So Pell pulled the trigger for him.<br> - And Townley?<br> It was his idea. Grand Dragons,<br> they don't get their hands dirty.<br> The whole thing, huh? Bullet by bullet.<br> I don't suppose you're interested in words<br> like "coercion" or "hearsay" or "duress".<br> This is no good in court.<br> We're not in court, Mr. Ward.<br> We'll never get 'em on murder anyway.<br> That's a state charge.<br> These hayseeds will never prosecute.<br> - I know that!<br> - We've got to get 'em in federal court!<br> - Violation of civil rights!<br> - Remember whose rights you're violatin'!<br> - Don't put me on your perch, Mr. Ward!<br> - Don't drag me into your gutter!<br> These people crawled out of a sewer,<br> Mr. Ward!<br> And maybe the gutter's<br> where we should be!<br> Thank you.<br> This better be important.<br> Who the hell called this meeting?<br> - We thought you did.<br> - Of this group? Are you stupid?<br> You didn't call this? Shit.<br> - If you didn't call this, who the fuck did?<br> - Shut up.<br> Is this some kind of bullshit setup?<br> Ray, are you sure you didn't call this?<br> Cos I got a note from my wife<br> and it said it was from you and Clinton.<br> Lester, shut up!<br> Now,<br> we're all gonna walk straight outta here...<br> ...and say nothing.<br> That means nothin', Lester.<br> - First one who opens his mouth is dead.<br> - Shut up.<br> Hey, Clinton.<br> Clinton.<br> Looks like the rattlesnakes<br> are startin' to commit suicide.<br> Hi, Lester.<br> We'll give you that ride home.<br> What?<br> Well, I know you said 4.30<br> but we're runnin' a little late, so...<br> - I'll meet you in the car.<br> - You're cracked.<br> Do you have change of a 20?<br> Sure.<br> Get in the car, Lester.<br> Or you'll have a hard time pickin'<br> your nose once I've closed this drawer.<br> Lester, you could make it a lot easier on<br> yourself by goin' on the record right now.<br> I ain't got nothin' to say.<br> You barkin' up the wrong tree, mister.<br> Lester, I gotta tell you somethin'.<br> We got you cold.<br> Your buddies have already talked.<br> You're lyin'.<br> You're in a lot of trouble. We know you<br> drove the second vehicle, the green truck.<br> And your buddy says...<br> Refresh my memory here, Mr. Bird.<br> "Lester Cowens kicked the Negro<br> twice in the face and then shot him. "<br> - That's a goddamn lie.<br> - No, it's true. What else, Mr. Bird?<br> "Lester Cowens said 'They only left me<br> a nigger, but at least I shot me a nigger. "'<br> - I didn't kill him. I shot him in the ass.<br> - We know that.<br> He was already dead by the time you shot<br> him. But your buddy sees it differently.<br> Your buddy tells it that you killed the kid.<br> You either go on the record right now...<br> ...or it's gonna be your ass<br> we're talkin' about, not just a black kid's!<br> Think about it, Lester.<br> Come on out of there.<br> Come on out.<br> This is tricky.<br> They make it look so easy, don't they?<br> I got a question for you, Clinton.<br> You don't mind if I call you Clinton,<br> do you?<br> I feel like I know you so well.<br> The way we have it,<br> on the night of the murders...<br> ...you made a short speech as the<br> bulldozer buried the kids in the dam.<br> How does Lester tell it?<br> "Mississippi will be proud of you.<br> You've struck a blow for the white man. "<br> Is that what you said, Clinton? Hm?<br> Is that what you said?<br> It must've been you...<br> ...because Clayton Townley and<br> Ray Stuckey were too smart to be there.<br> And you was too stupid to think<br> anybody'd remember what you said.<br> But old Lester, he got a good memory.<br> (grunt)<br> (Anderson) I'm sorry.<br> I haven't done this for a long time.<br> Did you make a speech the night that<br> you beat up your wife, Clinton? Huh?<br> Did ya?<br> Did you strike a blow<br> for the white man that night?<br> (door closes)<br> You got a stupid smile.<br> You know that, Pell?<br> Can you see it? Huh? Good!<br> Did you smile when the bulldozer<br> ran over the black kid's body? Did ya?!<br> Did you smile when the bodies<br> were covered over? Did ya?!<br> Get up here. Come on. Get up!<br> Did you smile that same stupid smile,<br> huh?!<br> Did ya?! You...<br> (crashing from inside)<br> Did ya smile, Pell? Did ya smile?!<br> Huh?! Did ya?!<br> Make no mistake about it, Deputy.<br> I'll cut your fuckin' head off and not give<br> a shit how it reads in the report sheet.<br> (door closes)<br> One more bite. One more bite.<br> One more bite, darlin'. One more bite.<br> (baby crying)<br> - Shit, Lester! What the fuck is goin' on?!<br> - Shut up!<br> Get in the bedroom and lock the door!<br> And stay away from the windows!<br> Shit.<br> Please. Please! I didn't say a thing!<br> I swear! It's a setup! I didn't say nothin'!<br> I didn't say nothin'!<br> Nothin'! I didn't say nothin'!<br> I didn't say nothin'!<br> I didn't say nothin'!<br> (coughing)<br> (gunshots)<br> You're lucky we've been<br> watchin' your ass, Lester.<br> If you go on the record, Mr. Cowens,<br> we'll give you protection. If not...<br> If not, they're gonna kill you anyway.<br> Oh. You need a toilet, Lester.<br> We really had him goin', huh?<br> We'll take care of the check, Mr. Swilley.<br> Well, I suppose I'II... be back for supper.<br> Button up, Wesley.<br> Why did he do it?<br> He wasn't even in on it. Wasn't even Klan.<br> Mr. Bird, he was guilty.<br> Anyone's guilty who watches this happen<br> and pretends it isn't.<br> No. He was guilty all right.<br> Just as guilty as the fanatics<br> who pulled the trigger.<br> Maybe we all are.<br> Hello!<br> Yeah.<br> I just missed you at the hospital.<br> They said you'd gone home.<br> What's left of it.<br> - I'm real sorry.<br> - So am I.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Where will you go?<br> - I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm stayin'.<br> This is my home. Born here.<br> Probably die here.<br> If I wanted to leave,<br> I would've done it a long time ago.<br> Things'll work out.<br> There's enough good people around here<br> know what I did was right.<br> And enough ladies<br> like the way I fix their hair.<br> Hey.<br> If you're ever in Des Moines...<br> ...don't send me a postcard.<br> OK.<br> # We cannot see<br> # In the future<br> # No, no, no, no, no<br> # And it's hard<br> # To smile<br> # Through trials<br> # No, we cannot see<br> # Every pitfall<br> # But we must walk on<br> # By faith<br> # Each day<br> # Oh, Lord<br> # Whoa, on Monday<br> # Walk on<br> # And on Tuesday<br> # Walk on<br> - # Whoa, let Jesus<br> - # Let Jesus be<br> - # Let him be your<br> - # Your guide<br> # Whoo-oo-oo<br> # He's able<br> # He could carry your load<br> # And he could see way down the road<br> # Walk on<br> (singing continues)<br> You wanna drive, Rupert?<br> Yeah.<br> # On Monday<br> # Walk on<br> - # And on Tuesday<br> - # Walk on<br> # Let Jesus be<br> - # Let him be your<br> - # Your guide<br> - # He's able<br> - # To carry your load<br> # To carry your load<br> # And he can see way down the road<br> # Walk on...<br> (# "Walk on by Faith"<br> by Lannie Spann McBride)<br>
