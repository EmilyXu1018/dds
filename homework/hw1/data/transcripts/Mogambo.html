                        Laddie, our luck's in.<br> Black leopard, laddie.<br> Black leopard nosing the kill.<br> Get the jeep, Brownie.<br> Boltchak!<br> Come on, on your feet. Let's go.<br> Don't let him twist that net.<br> Come on, get around there.<br> Get a move on, man.<br> Easy, Boltchak!<br> - Big time! He's a big one!<br> - Yeah. Young too.<br> Boltchak, stop that!<br> Who's there? Bunny?<br> Bunny?<br> No, this is not Bunny.<br> Who are you?<br> May I ask who you are, why you're here...<br> ...and what in blue blazes is going on?<br> - My name is Eloise Kelly.<br> Better known in the gay capitals of Europe<br> as "Honey Bear" Kelly.<br> The first thing that's going on is my robe,<br> on your arm there...<br> ...if you'll be so cooperative.<br> With pleasure, Miss Kelly.<br> Stop. Throw.<br> Turn around.<br> No kidding, find Bunny<br> and tell him I'm here, will you?<br> I'd be glad to, if you'd tell me<br> who Bunny is and where I'd find him.<br> The Maharajah of Bunganore.<br> Didn't he tell you I was coming?<br> So you came down to visit<br> with the Maharajah?<br> Sure. All the way from New York.<br> I think it's a dirty trick he wasn't on hand<br> to meet me when I came.<br> - Didn't he tell you?<br> - No. The Maharajah is in India.<br> He left here a week ago.<br> - He didn't.<br> - Yes, he did.<br> It seems someone is trying to take away<br> some of his palaces.<br> So he went back<br> to see what he could do about it.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Didn't he say anything about me,<br> that I was coming or anything?<br> No, he didn't.<br> Just between you and me,<br> I think he's turned out to be a big heel.<br> He didn't even leave you a return ticket.<br> Look, Mr. Whoever-You-Are,<br> let me jump to my own conclusions.<br> Of all the rotten, subversive tricks.<br> Flying all the way, thousands of miles,<br> to this lousy place...<br> ...arriving here hot and tired<br> as a Sixth Avenue mink...<br> That water's even hotter, and that soap<br> gives out as much lather as blue cheese.<br> I'm the man that owns this building,<br> the shower, and the soap.<br> - I wouldn't be proud of it.<br> - This is my home, be it ever so humble.<br> I had to have some place to go.<br> I couldn't get a word out of laughing boy<br> over there...<br> ...with the sleigh bells in his ears.<br> Of all the dirty...<br> Bawling out the Maharajah long-distance<br> isn't going to do any good.<br> If you'll pardon my subtlety...<br> I'm not so sure I'd want you on safari<br> in the first place.<br> I run a business here.<br> I'm working these men.<br> They have to keep their mind on work...<br> Look, buster,<br> don't you get overstimulated with me.<br> I'm the little gal that flew all the way<br> from New York...<br> ...to this lousy place, this Dark Continent.<br> Only I expected to find<br> a man with a flashlight.<br> I suggest you use up some of that energy<br> in getting your clothes on.<br> - I'll assign you to a room at the other end.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Can't you get me a canoe, or a truck,<br> or roller skates to get out of here?<br> Trucks couldn't get through this country,<br> even if I could spare one.<br> You're stuck with us<br> until next week's boat.<br> - You mean there's no way to get out?<br> - No.<br> Now, weren't you going to do something<br> about getting dressed?<br> Boy.<br> This will be the gayest week<br> of the season.<br> Plenty deep, all right.<br> I thought I told you to replace<br> that barbed wire.<br> We went after a black leopard,<br> remember, laddie?<br> I'm sorry, Brownie.<br> Hi, girl. Hello. How are you? Come here.<br> All right, let's get on with the feeding.<br> What do you think I'm doing now?<br> Vic, you're getting too unstrung<br> for your own good.<br> Why don't you fly out to Nairobi<br> or even Cairo for a week or two?<br> You haven't been out of here<br> for just on a year.<br> I'd like to, but Dorgenbeck's yelling<br> for those two white hippo.<br> And I'll pick that cat up, if I have<br> to run him all the way to the Congo.<br> I know. But you need relaxation.<br> And the little trinket that's dropped<br> from the Maharajah's turban...<br> ...she's a spry little bit.<br> That's playgirl stuff.<br> I've seen them in London, Paris, Rome.<br> They start life in a New York nightclub...<br> ...and end up covering the world<br> like a paint advertisement.<br> Not an honest feeling<br> from her kneecap to her neck.<br> Getting rather meticulous, aren't you?<br> Maybe. Maybe it's about time.<br> Everything snarls around this joint.<br> Hi. How are you, boy? You're a nice guy.<br> Hi, fellas. Hi, boy.<br> Hi, boy.<br> Hey, you wanna chew some gum?<br> Hey, Kelly, get away from that chimp.<br> And stop feeding him bubblegum.<br> - Can't anybody be friendly around here?<br> - Friendly? That chimp?<br> He'd bite your finger off just for fun.<br> - But he was only...<br> - It's your lookout.<br> His teeth are poison.<br> Once they sink into you, you'll blow up...<br> ...like an eggplant.<br> - All the other animals are being fed.<br> May I ask what time we get ours?<br> You may not hear it with the other noises,<br> but I'm beginning to rumble.<br> We dine at 9.<br> How continental.<br> Come here, darling.<br> You're such a nice little baby.<br> Come on over.<br> Come on, little baby. You're nice.<br> This is Miss Kelly.<br> Mr. Brown-Pryce, Mr. Boltchak.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Mr. Marswell, you look a lot better.<br> I bet you even smell better.<br> Let's hope your temper's the equivalent.<br> It's on an even keel.<br> It'll probably improve with food.<br> Now that's my nice, healthy boy.<br> The Nordleys are coming out<br> by next week's boat...<br> ...instead of the following.<br> Good. That means we can get rid of them<br> one week earlier.<br> - I'm handing them over to you, Boltchak.<br> - Relatives, I take it?<br> No, customers. He's an anthropologist.<br> He's going on safari.<br> You'll have to excuse me,<br> I left my cap and gown at the cleaners.<br> Anthropologist.<br> He studies man and man's development,<br> looks for skulls...<br> ...examines heads and all that.<br> Examines heads. Should have met him<br> before I left New York.<br> He could have examined both mine.<br> Let's not get sick over this, gentlemen.<br> It's not that funny.<br> You're so good, Miss Kelly.<br> That ends that, doesn't it? No kidding,<br> I've never met scientific types.<br> I'd like to meet them.<br> I might learn something.<br> I don't think you'll be seeing<br> too much of them.<br> You'll be wanting to get back<br> on the same boat.<br> Okay, coach, take me out. I'm through.<br> Wait! Hey, wait a minute!<br> Hey, wait for me! Wait!<br> Hey, a kangaroo.<br> I'm sorry, I can't sleep with that lion<br> or whatever it is chirping.<br> - Do you mind if I stay here for a while?<br> - No, have a seat.<br> - Sure I won't bother you?<br> - No, not at all.<br> - New batch of magazines came in today.<br> - Good.<br> What makes him do that? Is he hungry?<br> There's probably a lioness lurking<br> in the bush out there somewhere.<br> I guess there's all sorts of hunger<br> in the world, isn't there?<br> This is a weird sort of business to be in,<br> collecting animals.<br> I guess it's fun for a man, isn't it?<br> When it's profitable.<br> You sell them to zoos?<br> Circuses, trainers.<br> How much do you get...<br> ...for a baby elephant, for instance?<br> A dumbo?<br> Is that really the name for them?<br> - Around $5000. Tough to ship, though.<br> - I saw a baby elephant in the zoo once.<br> He was sucking on a gallon jug of milk<br> with a nipple attached.<br> Can you imagine that?<br> A whole gallon of milk.<br> Their mothers carry much more than that.<br> More than a gallon?<br> I know. Have you got any kangaroos?<br> What do you get for a kangaroo?<br> You have to go to Australia for kangaroos.<br> Yes. Like I said,<br> I was educated at the York Club.<br> I'd like to see a kangaroo close up.<br> A mama kangaroo.<br> Is it true that they carry their babies<br> in a little pouch thing?<br> - That's right. All marsupials do that.<br> - Ma... What?<br> Animals that carry their young,<br> like a papoose in reverse.<br> Isn't that the darnedest thing.<br> Everything but a zipper, huh?<br> - Kelly, you're all right. How about a drink?<br> - I'd love one.<br> - Sorry about no ice.<br> - It's all right.<br> Doctors say it's bad<br> for your pouch, anyway.<br> - Soda or water?<br> - Water. I find always that with water...<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Do something!<br> - That's just old Joe.<br> - Old Joe?<br> Yes. He's our migratory mousetrap.<br> I bet there isn't a rat or a mouse<br> within 100 yards of this place.<br> Oh, boy, to think I haven't had<br> my first drink yet.<br> I have old Joe around to trap young girls<br> into where you are right now.<br> Oh, now, Mr. Marswell...<br> ...I don't imagine you<br> need old Joe for that.<br> The river looks awfully pretty<br> in the moonlight, doesn't it?<br> Wait a minute.<br> You're turning<br> into the original African hotrod.<br> I can always quit.<br> You can be nice and sweet<br> when you want to, can't you?<br> How do you know?<br> Maybe you spoke too soon.<br> I'm warning you. I'm searching.<br> I'm looking, really I am.<br> I'll look with you for a little while.<br> Still pounding away at that old rogue?<br> Hi. It's the only piece of jazz<br> I've been able to find around this place.<br> It's been played more in the last week<br> than the last 30 years.<br> No kidding.<br> Have you been out here that long?<br> I came out here for my health.<br> - I found it. I'm still here.<br> - Where did you get that scar?<br> An old buffalo charged.<br> First barrel misfired,<br> and we danced around a bit.<br> - That's one way to die, isn't it? Dancing.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Where did you get yours?<br> - What?<br> Your scars.<br> You've got them,<br> though they're not visible.<br> Sorry. I'm a nosy old idiot, my dear.<br> You're pretty smart.<br> Nice, gentle smart, though.<br> Someday when I know you better<br> I'll tell you all about it.<br> Listen to old Trader Horn out there.<br> "Attaboy. Chop, chop, bwana master."<br> - All packed, Kelly?<br> - My, we're busy as... Packed?<br> The boat's here in 10 minutes.<br> Muntala'll take your luggage to the dock.<br> Animals ready for loading, Brownie?<br> Yes.<br> Hi, sweetie.<br> Hello, baby.<br> Come and say goodbye to your mommy.<br> Your mommy's going home.<br> Now, you be a good little boy.<br> Wash behind your ears every day,<br> and eat all your nice raw potatoes...<br> ...so you'll grow up to be<br> a big, fat elephant.<br> And then step on your<br> Uncle Victor's corns every day.<br> Oh, oh, the boat. Yeah.<br> - I'll see your baggage aboard, my dear.<br> - Thank you. You've been very sweet.<br> - You're a nice girl.<br> - I get it, Brownie.<br> He's running a business<br> and I'm a bottleneck.<br> Sometimes a man can't see the one tree<br> because of the forest.<br> Someday he's gonna bump<br> into the wrong kind of tree...<br> ...and get his nose busted.<br> Take care of yourself, Brownie.<br> And him too.<br> Here we are.<br> I wish you could stick around for a while,<br> but I'll be too busy...<br> Don't spell it out for me.<br> You know, my little white hunter,<br> it's high time I was on my way anyhow.<br> It's been...<br> - It's been nice having you here...<br> - Yes.<br> It's certainly been something<br> I didn't expect.<br> When the rainy season starts,<br> I might fly up to Paris.<br> If you happen to be there,<br> we might run into each other again.<br> Might.<br> Take it easy. Drop me a line.<br> - Hello, Vic. Hello, Brownie.<br> - Hello, John.<br> I have the happiness<br> to present Mr. Nordley.<br> - Mr. Marswell?<br> - Yes.<br> How do you do? We finally made it.<br> - Mr. Nordley, Brown-Pryce.<br> - How are you?<br> And Mrs. Nordley.<br> Linda, darling.<br> - Mrs. Nordley.<br> - Mrs. Nordley.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Mr. Brown-Pryce.<br> - Welcome.<br> - How do you do?<br> It's so exciting and thrilling<br> finally to arrive...<br> Take them up to the house, will you?<br> This way, please.<br> Hey, kid.<br> - Have you got money for your plane fare?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Wait a minute...<br> - I'll brain you if you don't take it.<br> Let's call it a 99-year loan.<br> This is one loan I'll pay back<br> if I have to live 99 years to do it.<br> Well, here we go. Bronx Zoo next.<br> - Everything all right? Good trip?<br> - This is charming.<br> Everything's so neat and clean.<br> I'll be unbearably frank<br> and say I didn't expect this.<br> I'll be frank and say<br> that you're a big surprise to me too.<br> In what way?<br> The wife of the last scientist<br> who was here...<br> ...weighed 180 pounds<br> of pure muscle...<br> ...had a good start on a mustache...<br> ...and every time she spoke<br> to her husband...<br> ...every lion in the territory took off.<br> He was a little man with a beard,<br> an authority on some kind of flea.<br> I sincerely hope I've disappointed you.<br> Come on, I'll show you your room.<br> This is Juma. He's your personal maid.<br> Anything you want, ask him.<br> You won't understand him,<br> but he will you.<br> - Isn't this nice?<br> - About the bed, I didn't know...<br> ...so if you want twin beds...<br> - No.<br> - All right.<br> - Everything's most satisfactory.<br> - I have the beastliest ringing in my ears.<br> - Feeling down, darling?<br> It must be those shots we took.<br> The doctor said<br> they cause a reaction.<br> - What shots?<br> - Yesterday, at the settlement...<br> ...the tsetse fly injections.<br> - Tsetse fly?<br> Your letter didn't say anything<br> about going to tsetse fly country.<br> We understood we had to go through<br> to get to the gorillas.<br> Not necessarily. And why gorillas?<br> It's a pet theory of mine.<br> I want to study gorillas,<br> their family life and so on.<br> Even get some of their vocal sounds<br> on a tape recorder I brought with me.<br> - It's a theory on the derivative evolution...<br> - I wouldn't understand.<br> Again, to be frank, it's a difficult safari,<br> and it doesn't fit with my schedule.<br> If I'd known about this,<br> I wouldn't have taken the job.<br> Why?<br> You can't promise anything with gorillas<br> but trouble.<br> Some have worked for ten months<br> and never even glimpsed one.<br> I have other work to attend to.<br> - Donald's perfectly willing to pay...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> We'll have to stand by<br> the original agreement.<br> I'll hand you over to one of my assistants,<br> Mr. Boltchak. Perfectly capable...<br> - I want to work with you.<br> - Mr. Marswell...<br> ...Mr. Nordley made<br> his arrangements with you.<br> He made them with my company,<br> my organization.<br> Are you all right?<br> I think perhaps a glass of water...<br> - Donald, darling.<br> - Don't get excited.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Excessive reaction to the tsetse fly shot,<br> that's all.<br> He'll be out of his head for a day or two.<br> We'll snap him out of it.<br> I've got tablets.<br> Don't let him throw this blanket off.<br> The shoes.<br> Our young scientist just went<br> to his knees. Out cold. Tsetse fly shot.<br> That's too bad.<br> Mr. Marswell, he's trembling<br> and shaking and getting nauseated.<br> We've got to get him to a doctor.<br> Moving him would aggravate<br> his condition.<br> He's running a high fever.<br> We have to break it up.<br> - Haven't you a thermometer?<br> - We don't need one. Fever is fever.<br> But...<br> Just a minute, please, will you?<br> Would one of these be...?<br> A lion chewed him up.<br> This place is turning into a hospital.<br> Strap him up, Brownie.<br> Would one of these be the right thing?<br> Donald knows all about them...<br> Sorry. Out here, we have three antidotes<br> for everything:<br> Quinine, iodine, and castor oil.<br> Quinine should fix him up very nicely.<br> I don't think he needs<br> the other two, do you?<br> At certain times,<br> jokes are in very poor taste.<br> Come on, no reason to lose your temper.<br> Please hurry.<br> There you are.<br> He'll start to sweat in half an hour or so.<br> Keep him well covered up.<br> I'll be back from time to time.<br> He's strong enough, all right.<br> Got a bite like a young croc.<br> Mr. Marswell, just a minute.<br> Is that all you're going to do for him?<br> What do you expect me to do?<br> Crawl in bed with him and hold his hand?<br> Keep him well covered up<br> and get all the water down him you can.<br> - Will you do that? Will you do what I said?<br> - Yes.<br> And give him one of those pills<br> every four hours.<br> Good night.<br> Mr. Marswell.<br> Oh, no, please sit still.<br> It's time for his pill<br> but he's sleeping so well...<br> ...I didn't want to wake him.<br> I'll have a look.<br> Boltchak, play cards.<br> - Much better. Let him sleep.<br> - All right.<br> Good night.<br> I'd like to apologize about this morning.<br> I'm terribly ashamed.<br> I had it coming.<br> - You pack a good wallop.<br> - Please.<br> It was very shabby behavior.<br> - I hope you'll be comfortable on that.<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> It was most thoughtful of you.<br> What on earth are those horrible sounds?<br> An animal of some kind?<br> Yes. They're hippos fighting.<br> - Why are they fighting?<br> - Probably over a female.<br> - Thank you very much for everything.<br> - I'll put it on the bill.<br> My room is the last one<br> on the porch corridor...<br> ...in case he needs anything<br> during the night.<br> Thank you again.<br> Good night.<br> Nordley come out of it yet?<br> Yes. They're both feeling much better.<br> Two pretty girls in one week.<br> Kelly.<br> I'm going to miss Kelly.<br> Kelly was all right.<br> I didn't say she wasn't, did I?<br> Take it easy going up them stairs.<br> Give me a bag. Throw me a bag up.<br> - Which one?<br> - The little one.<br> Here you are.<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hold on, and I'll get the others up to you.<br> I've got hold of one more. You want that?<br> - Leave it for Marswell.<br> - I've got it now.<br> I'm coming up the stair with it.<br> You women and your bags.<br> Hi there.<br> Anybody up on the old homestead?<br> Hi. The return of Frankenstein.<br> - What happened?<br> - Shipwrecked...<br> ...and me without a desert island<br> to my name.<br> A catastrophe,<br> a bleeding bellyful of bad luck.<br> - He's stinking.<br> - How come? Where?<br> About three miles down the river,<br> the engine packs up.<br> The current got hold of us<br> and drifted us onto a mud bar.<br> What about the cages?<br> The animals all right?<br> They're all right.<br> We left the crew to look after them.<br> - We came here in the tender.<br> - Tender? I'll say it was.<br> Hi, Brownie.<br> And in the dark too.<br> Any minute I expected to be<br> up to me hips in hippopotamuses.<br> You got me doing it now.<br> Could you send a couple of your boys<br> to the settlement with the news?<br> Boltchak, go get Muntala.<br> - Have a drink.<br> - Thank you, miss.<br> - How long will repairs take?<br> - No time at all.<br> Maybe a day after we<br> get the replacement.<br> It'll take us about three<br> or four weeks to get it.<br> Four weeks?<br> - Brownie, take him.<br> - Come on. Time for your nap.<br> Leon will bring the boys around for<br> a chat, they'll shove off in the morning.<br> Take the bottle with you.<br> Thank you, Mr. M.<br> Yeah, Brownie. Brownie!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Just a minute.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Nordley are in that room.<br> I'll have Boltchak move in with Brownie.<br> You can take his room.<br> - He'll be back soon.<br> - Yeah, the scientific characters.<br> They look kind of shiny new and young<br> to be scientific types, don't they?<br> - Yeah, but take it easy, will you?<br> - What do you mean?<br> You know, Mrs. Nordley has led<br> a sheltered sort of life, I guess...<br> ...and, well, let's not get too informal.<br> You know what I mean.<br> I know what you mean.<br> You have as much gallantry in that remark<br> as you think I've got brains.<br> - Now, wait a minute...<br> - Never mind.<br> I'll just act like I was your sister,<br> down from Vassar for the holidays.<br> That was pretty lame talk.<br> But you know what I'm talking about.<br> It's possible that I have a slight inkling<br> as to your outlook on life.<br> Joe, get off my bed.<br> Scram!<br> Hi, baby. Come on, let me in.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Behave. Wait a minute, boy.<br> Wait.<br> Come on, now.<br> Hey, listen, save some for the little girl.<br> Wait a minute. Here, okay.<br> No, no. No more.<br> You're a nice little girl.<br> Here's one. Hey, wait!<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute!<br> You're such a pig.<br> You don't deserve any more. No!<br> Now, if you're not such a pig,<br> I'll feed you.<br> Here, little girl. Here, little girl.<br> Here, little girl. Here you are.<br> Here. Come on.<br> No, no!<br> Oh, hi.<br> How do you do?<br> My name is Mrs. Nordley.<br> I'm Kelly, Eloise Kelly.<br> I hear your husband isn't well.<br> Is he better?<br> - He's much, much better, thank you.<br> - That's good.<br> Mr. Marswell says<br> he's made a very quick recovery.<br> Speaking of friend Marswell,<br> I wonder where he is.<br> Probably out lassoing<br> some ferocious gazelle or something.<br> He took the captain to the boat in a truck.<br> Something about<br> bringing back the animals, I believe.<br> Boy, I wish I'd had a truck last night.<br> I haven't walked that far<br> since some palpitating halfback...<br> ...tried to tell me he'd run out of gas.<br> You've been here on some sort of safari?<br> I was going on one,<br> or at least I thought I was.<br> I came to visit an old pal of mine,<br> the Maharajah of Bunganore.<br> - Do you mind?<br> - No.<br> But the big, thoughtless cad stood me up.<br> - He stood you...?<br> - In Americanese...<br> ...that means that when I got here<br> he wasn't here.<br> Men can get you into all sorts of trouble,<br> can't they?<br> That was quite a shame.<br> When Marswell first heard about it,<br> he was furious...<br> ...but then he calmed down,<br> and he was kind of sweet about it.<br> He's kind of cute, I guess.<br> He's a rough, mean man at times.<br> I must get your husband<br> to examine his head, see what's inside.<br> I hope the saga of my Ionely travels<br> hasn't shocked you.<br> I suppose girls are more conservative<br> up your way, aren't they?<br> With my husband almost well again,<br> I had it in mind to take a little walk...<br> ...sort of get one's bearings.<br> - Nice day for it.<br> - Well, so be it.<br> Bless your big, bony knees.<br> Hi, Kelly.<br> You're up early.<br> You know me, the neurotic type,<br> insomnia.<br> Why didn't you tell a fella?<br> She's something.<br> She's the kind that makes men<br> want to break out of jail.<br> You been talking to Mrs. Nordley?<br> Well, now, look at him.<br> Knew to whom I was referring<br> right away.<br> Yeah, me and my crystal ball.<br> You and your crystal head.<br> Wipe that Emily Post look off your face.<br> I didn't endanger<br> your lily-white reputation.<br> - I said she's pretty.<br> - So she's pretty.<br> What the blue blazes has that<br> to do with the price of pork?<br> - She's nice too.<br> - Certainly.<br> - So she's nice. I said it first.<br> - Who cares who said it first?<br> - It might make her nicer if I said it first.<br> - All right. So you said it first.<br> - I better look in on him.<br> - Nordley's peacefully pounding his ear.<br> And not that you're interested,<br> but Mrs. Nordley has gone for a walk.<br> Gone for a walk? Where?<br> How should I know?<br> How do you like that?<br> Why didn't you try to stop her?<br> I had no idea people<br> couldn't go for a walk around here.<br> Mrs. Nordley walks off in the bush<br> like it was Hyde Park.<br> Take the jeep and go down the<br> forest trail. I'll take the river road.<br> Mrs. Nordley!<br> Linda, don't move.<br> Well, that's that.<br> Come on, let's go back to camp.<br> - I'm...<br> - Let's go.<br> I've certainly won myself the reputation<br> for being an utter fool.<br> I'm not so much worried<br> about your reputation as your health.<br> If anything should happen to you,<br> my reputation would suffer.<br> Doesn't a woman's reputation<br> mean anything to you?<br> Only if I'm personally interested.<br> Not very gracious, but understandable.<br> Donald will think I'm dreaming<br> when I tell him all this.<br> - Thank heavens you're a witness.<br> - Do you need one?<br> Donald's a husband who's believed<br> everything I've told him...<br> ...since I was five years old.<br> Five years old? You were married<br> rather young, weren't you?<br> Actually, we were married when I was 20.<br> How long ago was that?<br> - Sorry.<br> - No, it's all right.<br> I'm 27. Satisfied?<br> You want me to forget it?<br> Not necessarily.<br> Have you ever been married?<br> I've never had the fortune<br> to find a lady who was interested.<br> That could be the remark<br> of a cynical man.<br> What have I to be cynical about?<br> I make my contribution to this<br> mixed-up world. What else is there?<br> That could be the remark<br> of a Ionely man.<br> Could be.<br> Looks like we're in for a little storm.<br> Let's go back to camp. Come on.<br> - You've been out walking?<br> - Sure.<br> Better be careful.<br> Mrs. Nordley nearly got into trouble.<br> - Did she?<br> - Yes.<br> She's under the delusion<br> she can wander off...<br> ...without being in any danger.<br> From the wild animals, you mean.<br> Certainly. What else?<br> I don't know what happened<br> out in the bush...<br> ...but the lady seemed to be in danger<br> right here on the porch.<br> You're seeing things, aren't you?<br> Hi, Brownie.<br> A party!<br> The Nordleys. It's their<br> first night here, so I thought...<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Good evening.<br> Feeling better?<br> I just have to get my clothes changed.<br> Be right with you.<br> Miss Kelly, this is my husband.<br> How do you do? Excuse me.<br> Gotta get dressed, you know.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Who was the young girl?<br> - Miss Kelly.<br> "Honey Bear." American.<br> Judging by your appetite,<br> you must be quite well again.<br> I feel wonderful.<br> Thanks to you, Dr. Marswell.<br> And you look it. What's more, you've<br> brought culture to Marswell's circus.<br> I love the custom black tie<br> in the middle of the jungle.<br> Do you know that before you got here<br> we wore onion sacks?<br> Anyone else wish to join me<br> in a little more of the grape?<br> Mrs. Nordley?<br> - It's good for the nerves, they tell me.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Mine host?<br> - No, thanks.<br> That's right. I forgot.<br> These animal-catching characters<br> don't have many nerves...<br> ...just one great big one.<br> You seem to have a real fondness<br> for that wine.<br> Any year, any model.<br> They all bring out my better nature.<br> It was a pretty exciting afternoon.<br> I can't tell you, Vic...<br> You don't mind if it's Vic and Donald<br> from now on, do you?<br> - Why not?<br> - And "Honey Bear."<br> Oh, yes.<br> I mean the luck in your getting back<br> in time to go after Linda.<br> Old girl, you could<br> have had a very bad mauling.<br> I hear you can get one anytime<br> in these parts...<br> ...if you ask for it.<br> - More coffee, Mrs. Nordley?<br> - No, thank you.<br> You must realize even the smallest<br> of creatures in Africa are voracious.<br> I was reading only the other day<br> of an incident of the red driver ant.<br> It's a very tough insect.<br> Some poor blighter left his launch<br> at the riverbank...<br> ...and along came an army of these ants<br> and ate up everything but the engine.<br> Good heavens.<br> We have hundreds of different varieties<br> of ants in this country.<br> Oh, yes, I saw quite a few ants<br> this afternoon.<br> But I guess they were just<br> the old-fashioned kind, huh?<br> All through, I guess.<br> Why don't we have some music<br> to soothe the savage breasts?<br> Do you play?<br> No, but you can pump<br> if you feel strong enough.<br> - I see, it's one of those.<br> - Yes.<br> "Coming Through the Rye".<br> That's a bit of home.<br> - Are you in good voice, Miss Kelly?<br> - No, but I feel like singing.<br> Give forth, then.<br> I say, that's absolutely delightful.<br> I'm a reedy tenor,<br> but I'll join you in this verse.<br> - Wonderful. Brownie, let's make it a trio.<br> - Yes.<br> - A bunch of wailing banshees, huh?<br> - All right.<br> I don't wanna interrupt<br> but I thought you'd want to know.<br> If you're willing to start, I'd be<br> glad to take you to gorilla country.<br> - Really? That's splendid.<br> - Provided you haven't changed your mind.<br> Changed our minds?<br> Hear that, Linda? Isn't it wonderful?<br> Yes, yes, simply wonderful.<br> I was thinking of that letter<br> from Ringling Brothers.<br> They offered a nice prize<br> for a pair of young ones.<br> I haven't been in gorilla country<br> for several years.<br> It'll be a good change of that routine<br> you were telling me about.<br> And since our two young guests<br> have it in their minds...<br> ...well, we could kill several birds<br> with one stone...<br> ...to coin a phrase.<br> I think it's absolutely wonderful.<br> You'll pardon my schoolboy enthusiasm,<br> but you see...<br> ...Vic was so stubborn<br> about not taking us at first.<br> Why, he's just an old<br> quick-change artist...<br> ...but real quick.<br> Do you know that one minute<br> he can be Trader Horn himself...<br> ...and then suddenly<br> everything goes black...<br> ...and out he comes,<br> dressed as Dr. Livingstone...<br> ...I presume?<br> Fortunate for us, I'd say.<br> Nobody will be surprised but the gorillas.<br> Miss Kelly can come with us<br> as far as the district officer at Kenya.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I'll be quite all right.<br> I'll sort of go into a monastic retreat...<br> ...and realize how beautiful life really is.<br> We close up shop here except<br> for the boys looking after the animals.<br> You'll have a six weeks' wait,<br> or even longer.<br> We'll take her along as far<br> as the district officer at Kenya...<br> ...and she can check out with his party.<br> Yes, I guess that could be arranged.<br> In that case, you'll be on the plane<br> for Cairo within a week or ten days.<br> Fine. The sooner the better...<br> ...to coin a phrase.<br> I saw your light.<br> I thought you weren't asleep yet.<br> When do you plan to start?<br> We can be ready in about two days.<br> Full safari, I suppose.<br> Entire complement of boys.<br> Naturally.<br> You know this will delay the Dorgenbeck<br> and the Chicago Zoo order.<br> We can fill it quick enough<br> when we get back.<br> Vic, lad, that's a nice couple.<br> This is no good.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Nothing. Getting old, I'm afraid.<br> Good night.<br> Are they all Muntala's wives?<br> No, just six. The other three are cooking.<br> No kidding?<br> Yep, no kidding. Let's go.<br> Fascinating, eh, darling?<br> It's amazing. Look, what is that?<br> - Some sort of stork?<br> - Secretary bird.<br> Secretary birds. What a prosaic name.<br> - Why do they call them that?<br> - That's an unfair question.<br> I haven't the slightest idea.<br> That secretary on the left has a pair<br> of legs for the boss to drool over.<br> She looks like she's been chased<br> around the desk...<br> ...and is now headed<br> for the pay window.<br> Miss Kelly, we shall certainly hate<br> to lose you.<br> Now, don't be greedy.<br> Let the others speak for themselves.<br> - Just what is our schedule?<br> - It's down the same stretch...<br> ...for another two days<br> until we reach the river here.<br> There the Makuas will give us<br> canoes and paddle boys...<br> ...where we'll proceed downriver<br> till we reach Kenya station.<br> At Kenya station,<br> we contact Jack Wood.<br> He's the district officer<br> of the Samburu territory.<br> The Samburus!<br> Those are the chaps<br> I particularly want to visit.<br> And that, Mrs. Nordley,<br> is where I leave you all.<br> You all.<br> - No tears?<br> - We'll give you a going-away party.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Where then?<br> Then we'll proceed on foot<br> to the Mountains of the Moon.<br> That's the beginning of gorilla country.<br> Look, what are those?<br> Impala.<br> What simply exquisite creatures.<br> - You'd think they had wings.<br> - It's the Aepyceros Melampus Suara.<br> They can clear a 12-foot obstacle<br> with a leap as long as 35, 40 feet.<br> You mustn't take the megaphone<br> away from the driver.<br> We'll pass Grant's Tomb<br> any moment now.<br> - He'll tell you who's buried there.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> There's a handsome animal for you.<br> Thompson gazelle.<br> Lovely.<br> Who's the Mr. Thompson famous enough<br> to have a gazelle named after him?<br> He's a third baseman.<br> Hit a home run for the Giants once.<br> Won the pennant.<br> Miss Kelly, we'll give you<br> two going-away parties.<br> Well, I've got one for you.<br> See those zebras over there?<br> - Yes. The Equus Burchelli Granti.<br> - To me, they're zebras.<br> Are they born white with black stripes<br> or black with white stripes?<br> Actually, they're born black with...<br> I'm going on, aren't I?<br> Mrs. Nordley, this is quite a nice,<br> bright husband you have.<br> Information I'm already well aware of.<br> But I assure you that outside<br> of his niceness and his brightness...<br> ...there are many other reasons<br> why I'm in love with him.<br> Thank you, old girl.<br> I'd say he was a very lucky man.<br> Better turn in early. We'll start at 5:00<br> in the morning to miss the heat.<br> Here. Hang on to this.<br> It's loaded.<br> All you have to do is pull the trigger.<br> Who do I point this at?<br> Leopards and lions have been known<br> to come into tents.<br> Thank you, Mr. Marswell.<br> Actually, in light of recent development...<br> ...there'll be no danger of my<br> hitting you, will there?<br> - Look, Kelly, don't. We know each other...<br> - Never mind, Marswell.<br> It was just a dumb crack<br> that doubled right back at me.<br> Boy, how stupid can a gal get?<br> Good night, Kelly.<br> Good night.<br> - Everything all right? Anything you need?<br> - Everything's just fine, thank you.<br> - Good night, then.<br> - Just a moment, will you, please?<br> For several days now,<br> Miss Kelly's been making...<br> ...well, at least, insinuations.<br> I wouldn't let her upset me.<br> She'll be leaving us at Kenya station.<br> What would give her the right<br> to say things like that?<br> She saw us when we<br> walked up on the porch.<br> You must forget that,<br> that it ever happened.<br> It was just...<br> - Well, it was nothing.<br> - You want me to forget it?<br> That's why you changed your mind<br> about taking us on this trip.<br> Plus you're not in love<br> with your husband.<br> - You mustn't say that!<br> - Though you said you were.<br> - I know why you said it.<br> - I said it because it's true.<br> I am in love with Donald.<br> You asked me why I never married.<br> Maybe you yourself are the reason, Linda.<br> Linda.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> Hello, Vic. I just won 15 shillings<br> in a poker game. Meet my expenses.<br> - Good.<br> - Good night.<br> I'm tired.<br> Looks like the start<br> of some exciting weeks, eh, darling?<br> - Lin?<br> - What?<br> Of course, darling.<br> That Kelly girl is certainly a different type<br> from any I've met.<br> Wonderful sense of humor. I like her.<br> And it's perfectly obvious, of course.<br> What is?<br> There was a thing between her and Vic<br> before we arrived.<br> And now we are the villains.<br> In some odd way we've broken it up.<br> Not that I blame her, of course.<br> Vic's a devilishly attractive chap.<br> Don't you think so? As a woman?<br> I suppose so.<br> All I know is I'm glad you saw me first.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> - Good night, Donald.<br> Welcome, Victor.<br> - How are you, Victor?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello, Father.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Nordley<br> from England.<br> How do you do, Father?<br> Your music is wonderful, Father,<br> although it frightened me at first.<br> It's hardly Catholic. But it's a song<br> of welcome, and that's Christian.<br> We're just in time for lunch.<br> Brownie, you're not still on a diet?<br> Never, Father.<br> - Miss Kelly, Father Josef.<br> - How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> You're just in time for lunch.<br> So you good people are going<br> to the gorilla country?<br> Precarious animals.<br> A friend of mine at mission preparatory...<br> ...had his head torn from his body<br> by one of them beasts.<br> That was carelessness,<br> you know that.<br> We're relying on Victor<br> to see that we retain our heads.<br> I can't wait to see them<br> in their natural habitat.<br> The truest exemplary link between<br> modern man and his primitive derivation.<br> I think you and I could have a lusty debate<br> on the origin of man.<br> I'm afraid you'd prove too rugged<br> an opponent, Father.<br> I spoke to the chief...<br> ...and you can have the canoes<br> and the men on the usual conditions.<br> - Not again.<br> - I'm afraid so, Victor.<br> What are the conditions?<br> Is there any trouble?<br> In order to get the men and canoes<br> to go into that strange country...<br> ...the bwana mkubwa, the big chief,<br> the party of the first part...<br> ...to which our friend Victor<br> must undergo what's known as...<br> ...the ceremony of courage.<br> The ceremony of courage?<br> I don't think I've heard of it.<br> What is it, some sort of native custom?<br> It's sort of like a game of darts.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's a fine way to run a railroad, buster.<br> That's all right.<br> All right, Boltchak, load the boat.<br> Come on, we've got the canoes. Let's go.<br> Father, I'd like to speak to you a moment<br> when you have a chance.<br> - Certainly, my daughter.<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> Darling.<br> This is the jumping-off place.<br> Do you want to go on or turn back?<br> What on earth makes you say that?<br> You're taking me seriously.<br> I'd as soon turn back as...<br> Do you feel all right?<br> I'm sorry. I'm just a bit edgy.<br> I didn't sleep too well.<br> I know. It was an exciting evening.<br> You take a sedative tonight.<br> Get in the swing of things, darling.<br> With the world the way it is,<br> we may never have this chance again.<br> Let's live every minute of it.<br> Good morning.<br> I know everybody's in a terrible rush<br> this morning...<br> ...but I thought perhaps<br> we could have a few words together.<br> Yes?<br> I've been the champion of female<br> Airedales and I'd like to apologize.<br> What on earth for?<br> I assure you, there's nothing...<br> I'm feeling a great deal better<br> about life today.<br> So let's level, shall we?<br> I'm not blaming you by apologizing.<br> I'd just like to tell you<br> that I know how it is with you and Vic.<br> We girls are pretty smart<br> about those things, aren't we?<br> Aren't you being presumptuous<br> in assuming any...<br> Please, honey,<br> don't let me sit here with egg on my face.<br> I came here to be your friend.<br> The only way I know how<br> is to tell you that I understand.<br> It can happen.<br> He's an attractive burglar...<br> Really, if you'll excuse me,<br> I must finish my packing.<br> All right. I'll get out.<br> But keep your head, will you?<br> You're sitting pretty.<br> You're a lovely, attractive woman.<br> You're married to a wonderful man.<br> Is it possible that all of this advice...<br> ...is based on the fact<br> that you know Mr. Marswell...<br> ...just a little more intimately<br> than I do?<br> Gosh, you are stuck, aren't you?<br> - Once and for all...<br> - You're jealous.<br> Shouldn't you examine<br> your own emotions in that light?<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I could be pea green with jealousy...<br> ...and not hacked up any more<br> than I am already.<br> It's you we want to worry about.<br> This is no Sir Galahad<br> who loves from afar.<br> - This is a two-legged boa constrictor.<br> - I think you'd better leave.<br> All right, but remember,<br> I came here to be your friend.<br> For your sake.<br> And I'm keeping the offer open.<br> It'll be rugged, but I'll keep it open.<br> Go in the boat with Brownie.<br> I'll take Mrs. Nordley in the lead boat.<br> But wouldn't it be better if...?<br> - Do you mind, darling?<br> - Not at all.<br> That's just in case of emergency.<br> Are the men of this tribe<br> also polygamists like Muntala?<br> Only those who can afford<br> more than one wife.<br> It seems unfair to take them away<br> from their families.<br> You mean the men are taking a chance?<br> I'm quite sure that's what I mean.<br> No. The natives have<br> all sorts of devices...<br> ...to prevent their women<br> from being stolen.<br> In most tribes<br> there's a pre-marriage ordeal...<br> ...that guarantees fidelity.<br> Really? What's that, pray?<br> Let's see if I can...<br> Linda, look.<br> Isn't he beautiful?<br> Perfect specimen.<br> He's clean too.<br> Just had his Saturday night bath.<br> Look!<br> Reminds me of somebody I know.<br> You were saying about this device<br> for guaranteed fidelity...<br> Why wouldn't it pass<br> in the civilized world?<br> Primarily because you women<br> would probably vote it down.<br> But why?<br> Because it's a means whereby a woman<br> is rendered incapable of being unfaithful.<br> - I think I understand.<br> - Sorry to be so blunt about it.<br> No. It was my denseness.<br> I should have realized.<br> Brother, I can take your Cook's tour<br> around the zoo...<br> ...but when we get on this mental<br> striptease...<br> ...and hide behind<br> Louisa May Alcott...<br> ...I want a powder.<br> Brownie. Watch it. Hippo.<br> Kenya, heart of the Samburu.<br> I'm terribly keen on seeing those chaps.<br> There doesn't appear<br> to be a committee to welcome us.<br> Brownie, looks like this is<br> where I leave you.<br> I'm glad somebody's glum about it.<br> It's Vic. Vic Marswell.<br> Get your party out of here fast.<br> - What happened?<br> - Caught them ivory poaching.<br> When the corporal was taking<br> down the colors last night...<br> ...they came at us.<br> - Where are the rest of your men?<br> - Got two of them out last night.<br> It'll take several days<br> before police reserves arrive.<br> Get your party out quick.<br> These two... Good boys.<br> Don't bother about me.<br> I've had it.<br> There are gorillas. Three or four<br> families in the next valley.<br> - How do you know they'll stay?<br> - I don't. These people are great trackers.<br> We'll start out first thing in the morning.<br> Thanks.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Hi, Brownie.<br> Sit down and join the picnic.<br> You know me well enough now<br> to tell me about your scars?<br> Nothing new, Brownie.<br> Happens to lots of people.<br> We'd just been married three weeks<br> when Johnny had to sail...<br> ...and two months later I get a telegraph<br> from the War Department...<br> ...telling me that he and his little P-51...<br> You know, he had "Honey Bear"<br> painted on the nose.<br> Anyway, they both blew up<br> in a million pieces somewhere over Berlin.<br> You know, as short as it lasted,<br> it was like being blessed for a lifetime.<br> So you hit the high spots<br> and the gay beaches trying to forget him?<br> Yeah. Great strength of character.<br> But you'd know it if you met it again.<br> I say, you'd know it<br> if you met it again.<br> Yes, Brownie, I'd know it.<br> - Look.<br> - Flamingos.<br> - Gorillas.<br> - What?<br> Gorilla country.<br> It's nice up here, isn't it? High.<br> Yes, it is nice, for a change.<br> I don't like mosquito netting.<br> It separates people, doesn't it?<br> Donald, please.<br> I've got to fix these things.<br> Perhaps it's altitude,<br> but I feel very lightheaded.<br> - Don't you feel the least bit lightheaded?<br> - Don't, Donald, please.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, darling. It's nothing.<br> It's just that I'm terribly tired.<br> That long climb today. I don't know...<br> Come now, we've got a very<br> early start in the morning.<br> I don't know if I'll quite feel up to it.<br> Donald, please turn that light off.<br> It's shining straight in my eyes.<br> Right now.<br> Lin, darling.<br> You still my girl?<br> Don't be so childish.<br> That's good enough for me.<br> Why don't you come along?<br> You might find gorillas interesting.<br> Gorillas?<br> A month ago,<br> I was buying a bra at Macy's.<br> Now I'm studying gorillas yet.<br> No, thank you.<br> I'll stick around and help Muntala cook.<br> What did he say?<br> He says you can't even cook.<br> Gorilla. Lots of them.<br> - Is the battery ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> I didn't know they could climb trees.<br> Only the young ones do.<br> Donald, camera.<br> Ready to photograph a bull gorilla?<br> Why, yes. Wonderful.<br> Brownie, cover us.<br> Don't move back.<br> Don't budge an inch.<br> Hold still.<br> He's trying to bluff us.<br> Bring your camera up slowly.<br> - Brownie.<br> - What, chief?<br> - Watch the young bull.<br> - Got him.<br> There's the one<br> we want to pick up tomorrow.<br> That's the last we'll see of them today.<br> The boys can keep track of them tonight,<br> and we'll bring up the nets tomorrow.<br> This is the film and one of the reels.<br> Will you take them back<br> and keep them somewhere cool?<br> - Precious stuff.<br> - Of course.<br> Think you got anything<br> with that camera?<br> I hope so,<br> but I must admit I was pretty scared.<br> - Frightened to death.<br> - You were scared?<br> I'll never forget the first one I saw.<br> - Linda was all right too.<br> - You hear that, darling?<br> They're a strange beast, gorilla.<br> You can bluff them sometimes,<br> and then sometimes...<br> We'll see tomorrow, when we net them.<br> Is it all right for me to stay up overnight<br> and get some night sounds?<br> Of course. It's not going to be<br> very comfortable for Linda, though.<br> I don't exactly want to get rid of you,<br> but you don't mind, do you?<br> No, of course not, Donald.<br> You stay up here with Donald.<br> Do you mind?<br> - Just as you say.<br> - Keep whatever boys you want.<br> - Boltchak?<br> - No.<br> I like my comforts in life too.<br> Darling.<br> If you're looking for Vic...<br> ...he's taking a walk with Mrs. Nordley.<br> Do you realize that just from the way<br> I can't stop myself looking at you...<br> ...that everybody knows?<br> - Everybody but Donald.<br> - At times I feel like...<br> - I know. I feel it myself.<br> But he has to be told, that's all.<br> I don't know how to tell him.<br> You stay in camp tomorrow.<br> I'm going up the hill.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - Yes.<br> Mind if I join the marshmallow roast?<br> No. Sit down.<br> Did you have a nice moonlight<br> constitutional?<br> - Very pleasant.<br> - "Pleasant," the man says.<br> At least that's gallantry.<br> It's none of my business...<br> ...but old Donzy boy<br> is not such a bad shot.<br> And he'd be well within his rights<br> if he suddenly decided to take home...<br> ...a little trophy from this paper chase.<br> As a matter of fact, your head would look<br> pretty decorative over his mantelpiece.<br> With your big ears stuck out<br> like an elephant about to charge.<br> Get off my back, Kelly.<br> I'm in no mood for it.<br> You mean that?<br> Vic, look at me.<br> This is no hit-and-run this time, is it?<br> You're really in love.<br> You better go to bed.<br> All right. I guess that's it.<br> I don't know how you'll solve this<br> or what good is going to come of it...<br> ...but whatever you do, Vic,<br> I wish you all the happiness in the book.<br> Go on to bed, kid.<br> Black king. What do I want<br> with an old black king?<br> Okay. Let him go. He'll find out.<br> Little boy with a Daisy air rifle.<br> "And, gee, Dad, it was just my size!"<br> Brownie. You and Boltchak<br> check the nets on the other side.<br> The nets wobble.<br> That net's falling apart back there.<br> You know that, don't you?<br> You sure you still want<br> to go through with this?<br> Certainly, Vic.<br> It might be a little dangerous, you know.<br> The old ones are sure to charge the net<br> when they...<br> Brownie's around and they're trying<br> to rope a young one for you.<br> - Donald.<br> - Yes, Vic?<br> - I want to talk to you.<br> - Just a minute, Vic.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - Yes, thanks.<br> We might as well<br> make ourselves comfortable.<br> This may take five minutes,<br> it may take an hour.<br> Depends on their disposition.<br> - We can sit here and talk.<br> - Good. We haven't had much opportunity.<br> When I admire a fellow<br> I always like to get to know him better...<br> ...exchange points of view and all that.<br> I like to have everything aboveboard too.<br> I'm glad to have<br> this opportunity of saying...<br> ...that I think that everything's<br> been handled simply magnificently.<br> Things haven't gone off<br> exactly like they might have, but...<br> Truly, this will be one of the most<br> memorable experiences of my life.<br> It's only that...<br> I'm disappointed for Linda's sake,<br> that's all.<br> What about Linda?<br> Her not coming up today,<br> not feeling up to it and all.<br> I realize now that much as I<br> enjoy this sort of thing...<br> ...field trips, roughing it, so to speak...<br> ...it's not for Linda at all.<br> - She wanted to come up, but I told her...<br> - Yes, I know. She's been wonderful...<br> ...making her pretenses in enjoying it.<br> But that's for my sake, you know.<br> She's been so moody of late,<br> almost irritable once or twice.<br> And believe me, Vic,<br> that's not like Linda at all.<br> The night before last she even forgot<br> it was our wedding anniversary.<br> That's usually the husband's blunder,<br> you know.<br> No, these trips aren't for Linda.<br> I suppose it's home in Devonshire<br> from now on...<br> ...raising that family<br> sooner than I expected.<br> Forgive me if I tell you<br> how much I'm in love with her.<br> Do I have to forgive you for that?<br> Seriously. It's been great to become<br> friends with a fellow like you.<br> We're so different, you see.<br> I imagine you've had to rub and sweat,<br> even for every penny you've made...<br> ...and everything you've<br> wanted to build. Me?<br> I'm one of those<br> silver-spoon chaps, I suppose.<br> I've been spouting<br> a whole autobiography.<br> Tell me something about yourself.<br> To begin with,<br> if I'm not too beastly inquisitive...<br> ...we have wondered why<br> an attractive chap like you...<br> ...has never got himself a wife.<br> I've been too busy collecting animals.<br> He's coming out now.<br> Stop talking<br> and watch what you came for.<br> - You certainly saved my life...<br> - You didn't think I planned it?<br> The last thing I wanted to do<br> was knock him over.<br> - No, of course...<br> - Let's stop the chatter for a while.<br> - Sorry. The little one got away.<br> - Never mind.<br> Tell Boltchak to stay up here.<br> Tell him I want to examine the gorilla.<br> Fine gorilla. Very fine specimen.<br> I'd say he weighed<br> close up to 700 or 800 pounds.<br> I say, Boltchak.<br> Do you have any idea<br> why Vic stalked off like that...<br> ...going back to camp<br> with hardly a word?<br> I'd say he had a very good reason<br> for hurrying back to camp.<br> Here. Have some more.<br> I must have said something to upset him.<br> If you don't know the reason,<br> I'd begin to find out if I were you.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> If I had a wife as pretty as yours...<br> ...I'd find out fast enough.<br> We'll go back to the canoes<br> the first thing in the morning...<br> ...get an early start.<br> Everything goes.<br> Where is everybody?<br> - Still up there.<br> - Did you get the baby gorillas?<br> Everything fouled up.<br> You don't look much like a bridegroom...<br> ...who cometh forth from his chamber<br> and rejoiceth at...<br> You don't look so hot.<br> I don't feel so hot.<br> You got left on third, huh, Marzy?<br> Didn't even go to bat.<br> You couldn't tell him?<br> No.<br> - You went noble.<br> - I went yellow.<br> You went noble.<br> How do you plan to break the news<br> down the street?<br> I'll think of some way.<br> That's just the way to keep you<br> clearheaded, of course.<br> Sometimes it gets you nasty<br> enough to get a nasty job done.<br> Then don't be so stingy<br> with your nastiness, partner.<br> Come here. Let's have a drink.<br> Like I've always said, Kelly,<br> you're all right.<br> - Here's to your noble nastiness.<br> - Skol, Kelly.<br> Drink up.<br> To the victor belongs the spoiled herring.<br> Victor, that's you. Vic. Joke. Laugh.<br> Yes, sir. You're all right, Kelly.<br> You've said that before, but I love it.<br> Don't worry, Vic.<br> I'm not trying to crawl back<br> into green pastures.<br> Poor old Marzy.<br> Got himself all tangled up<br> in one of his nets like a gorilla...<br> ...and he doesn't know how to get out.<br> If you two will excuse me,<br> I think I shall retire.<br> No, don't.<br> There's plenty in the bottle yet...<br> ...and more where that came from,<br> plenty for all of us.<br> Come on in, Linda. Join the party.<br> What are you so surprised about?<br> You always guessed Kelly and I<br> were old friends, didn't you?<br> It's all right for old friends<br> to have a drink, isn't it?<br> What are you saying? You're drunk.<br> Certainly I'm drunk, but I<br> certainly know what I'm saying.<br> Listen, Mrs. N,<br> you're not going to tell me...<br> ...that you've been taking<br> all this seriously, are you?<br> You know how it is on safari.<br> It's in all the books.<br> The woman always falls<br> for the white hunter.<br> And we guys make the most of it.<br> Do you blame us?<br> When you come along<br> with that look in your eye...<br> ...there isn't a guy<br> in the whole world who could...<br> - What's been going on?<br> - I'm glad you came in.<br> This big Congo Casanova has been after<br> your wife ever since she's been here.<br> She's been sport enough<br> to hold him off...<br> ...and not tell you<br> to not spoil your fun.<br> Tonight he got her here on the pretext...<br> Well, he was pretty drunk.<br> So when I came tearing over here to help,<br> he was getting pretty bad...<br> ...so she shot him,<br> as any decent woman would do.<br> - We're going, darling.<br> - Beat it.<br> Come on there. Get going.<br> If she hadn't I'd have done it myself.<br> Are you going to stand there<br> and bleed to death?<br> It's just a piece of skin.<br> Don't you go losing your head.<br> - You've done well up to now.<br> - Losing my head! Fine thing.<br> Stop talking<br> and put a bandage on this.<br> Then stop yelling at me.<br> Too bad you didn't teach her<br> to shoot a little straighter.<br> Africa and gorillas. Lions.<br> The only lions I ever want to see again<br> are the two in front of the Public Library.<br> - We're ready to shove off now.<br> - Darling.<br> - You can get into the boat now.<br> - Thank you, Brownie.<br> Are you sure you're ready to go?<br> Quite sure.<br> Now that you're leaving,<br> how about saying goodbye?<br> Okay. Goodbye.<br> I'm going to stay up there for a while...<br> ...try and pick up a couple of baby<br> gorillas. Make the trip pay for itself.<br> - How about you sticking around?<br> - What for?<br> - I thought that maybe...<br> - No.<br> Nobody is gonna wring me out<br> and hang me up to dry again.<br> How about it?<br> As soon as I'm through up there...<br> ...we could head back<br> and stop by Father Josef's.<br> Would you like that?<br> You mean you're gonna make<br> an honest woman out of me?<br> - It suits me, Kelly.<br> - It suits you?<br> Listen, you and your<br> quick-change acts...<br> ...aren't hanging blossoms over me...<br> ...because you feel the cold weather<br> coming on. No, thanks.<br> I'll go back where I can be honest<br> without getting kicked around.<br> I'll see you.<br> - What?<br> - Take good care of her!<br> I can't hear you.<br> I said, take good care of her!<br>
