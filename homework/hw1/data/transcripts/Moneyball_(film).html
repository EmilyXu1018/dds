I mean--<br> Okay, good. What's the problem?<br> Look, Billy, we all understand<br> what the problem is. We have to--<br> BILLY: Okay, good.<br> What's the problem?<br> We have to replace three<br> key players in our lineup.<br> BILLY:<br> Nope.

How you doing?<br> Fantastic.<br> Awesome.<br> Couldn't be better.<br> That's good to hear.<br> I'm not gonna waste your time.<br> You just tell me<br> what you're looking for.<br> Fifty million dollars<br> in additional payroll.<br> You should try Giambi.<br> Ouch.<br> I'm sorry. Too soon, right?<br> I want this to be<br> a friendly meeting.<br> It's not all<br> on your shoulders.<br> Where's Steve in this?<br> BILLY: Steve's great.<br> He's supportive<br> in rebuilding this team.<br> That's what we're gonna do.<br> So, what are you looking for?<br> A left-handed reliever.<br> I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.<br> That's not gonna happen.<br> Not even a discussion?<br> Billy, even if you could afford him,<br> respectfully, we love him.<br> We're not about to let him go.<br> You got this Venezuelan kid<br> coming up.<br> We had him.<br> We moved him to Detroit.<br> Huh.<br> What else you thinking?<br> Outfielders.<br> To replace Damon?<br> Yeah.<br> In your price range? No disrespect.<br> Enough, Mark.<br> Uh... Hollins?<br> BILLY:<br> Uh-uh.<br> Garcia?<br> No.<br> Maybe Coste.<br> Uh-uh.<br> That's it.<br> All right, tell me about Garcia.<br> To replace Johnny Damon?<br> Mark, is he healthy?<br> Yeah, he's healthy-ish.<br> He had that back thing.<br> He'll be ready for spring ball.<br> BILLY: I'll tell you what.<br> I can give you Guthrie<br> if you kick in some cash.<br> Mark Guthrie?<br> Yeah.<br> How much cash?<br> Two hundred K.<br> [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]<br> MARK:<br> Okay.<br> So Garcia's gonna be a no.<br> You're kidding me, right?<br> You're kidding me.<br> I'm not.<br> Okay. Straight up,<br> Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.<br> No kicker?<br> BILLY: Straight up.<br> I think it's gonna be<br> a hard no on Garcia,<br> but let's just keep going.<br> What else you thinking?<br> What are we doing? Is this business?<br> This is the way we do<br> business in Cleveland.<br> Hey.<br> Hello.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm Peter Brand.<br> What do you do?<br> I'm special assistant<br> to Mark Shapiro.<br> So, what do you do?<br> Mostly player analysis<br> right now.<br> Been on the job long?<br> First job in baseball?<br> It's my first job anywhere.<br> Wow, congrats.<br> Thank you.<br> First job.<br> Whose nephew are you?<br> Why does Mark listen to you?<br> I don't think, uh...<br> I don't think he does very often.<br> He just did.<br> Well, in that circumstance,<br> I think he was more listening<br> to Bruce than myself.<br> Mm-hm. Who are you?<br> I'm Peter Brand.<br> I don't give a rat's ass<br> what your name is.<br> What happened<br> in there?<br> What happened<br> in that room?<br> I'm not quite sure what<br> you're asking me, Mr. Beane.<br> What did you<br> tell Bruce?<br> I just told Bruce I like Garcia.<br> You like Garcia. Why?<br> Why?<br> I don't know. Ahem.<br> There is an epidemic failure<br> within the game<br> to understand<br> what is really happening.<br> And this leads people who run<br> Major League Baseball teams<br> to misjudge their players<br> and mismanage their teams.<br> I apologize.<br> Go on.<br> Okay. People who run ball clubs,<br> they think in terms of buying players.<br> Your goal shouldn't be<br> to buy players.
