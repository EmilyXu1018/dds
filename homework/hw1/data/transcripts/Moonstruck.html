I give you this.<br> You make good coffee.<br> You're a slob, but you make good coffee.<br> Ah, red roses.<br> Very romantic, huh?<br> Ah, the guy that sends these<br> really knows what he's doing.<br> The guy who sends those<br> spends a lot of money<br> on something that ends up as garbage.<br> I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta.<br> I'd be out of business.<br> What are you talking? I love flowers.<br> Thanks, Carmine.<br> Are you ready?<br> Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?<br> Very good, Mr Johnny.<br> We will both have the Ticino salad.<br> And I'll have special fish.<br> No, it's oily fish tonight.<br> Not before the plane ride.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> OK, we'll have the manicotti, Bobo.<br> That'll give you a base for your stomach.<br> You eat oily fish,<br> you go up in the air,<br> halfway to Sicily,<br> you'll be green and sweating.<br> You look after me.<br> You'll ruin the evening...<br> Patricia, please, don't leave.<br> Do you think I'm a talking doll?!<br> I was just making a point about<br> the way you stated your aspirations...<br> You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!<br> Kiss my aspirations?

I put my hand in the slicer<br> and it got caught<br> cos I wasn't paying attention.<br> The slicer chewed off my hand.<br> And it's funny, cos when<br> my fiance found out about it...<br> When she found out I had been maimed,<br> she left me for another man.<br> That's the bad blood<br> between you and Johnny?<br> Yes, that's it.<br> Yeah, but that's not Johnny's fault.<br> I don't care!<br> I ain't no freakin' monument to justice!<br> I lost my hand!<br> I lost my bride!<br> Johnny has his hand!<br> Johnny has his bride!<br> You want me to take my heartbreak,<br> put it away and forget?!<br> Is it just a matter of time<br> before a man opens his eyes<br> and gives up his one<br> dream,<br> his one dream of happiness?<br> Maybe.<br> Maybe.<br> This is the most tormented man<br> I have known.<br> I'm in love with this man.<br> But he doesn't know that.<br> Cos I never told him<br> cos he could never love anybody<br> since he lost his hand and his girl.<br> Where do you live?<br> Upstairs.<br> Can't we just talk?<br> What are we painting here?<br> The Sistine Chapel?<br> We should have been plumbers<br> like Castorini.<br> Well, Mr Castorini, what do you think?<br> $10,800.<br> That seems like a lot.<br> Look.<br> There are three kinds of pipe.<br> There's the kind of pipe you have,<br> which is garbage.<br> And you can see where that's gotten you.<br> Then there's bronze...<br> which is very good.<br> Unless something goes wrong.<br> And something always goes wrong.<br> And then<br> there's copper<br> which is the only pipe I use.<br> It costs money.<br> It costs money because it saves money.<br> I think we should follow<br> Mr Castorini's advice, heart.<br> And then<br> there's copper<br> which is the only pipe I use.<br> It costs money.<br> It costs money because it saves money.<br> And what did they say?<br> Well, the man understood me.<br> The woman wanted to be cheap.<br> But the man saw I was right.<br> You have such a head for knowing.<br> You know everything.<br> I've brought you something.<br> It's a present.<br> Oh, Cosmo!<br> Oh, my God!<br> They're little birds and stars.<br> Birds fly to the stars, I guess. Huh?<br> What's that smell?<br> - I'm making you a steak.<br> - I don't want it.<br> You'll eat it.<br> I like it well done.<br> You'll eat this one bloody<br> to feed your blood.<br> This is good.<br> Loretta.<br> - Where did Johnny find you?<br> - He knew my husband who died.<br> - How did he die?<br> - A bus hit him.<br> - Fast?<br> - Instantaneous.<br> - When did you get engaged?<br> - Yesterday.<br> So, five years ago, you got your hand<br> cut off and your woman left you.<br> - No woman since then?<br> - No.<br> Stupid.<br> When did your husband get hit by a bus?<br> Seven years ago.<br> - How many men since then?<br> - Just Johnny.<br> Stupid yourself.<br> No. Unlucky. I've not been lucky.<br> I don't care about luck.<br> You understand me?<br> It ain't that.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You think you're the only one<br> who ever shed a tear?<br> Why are you talking to me?<br> You got any whiskey? How about<br> you give me a glass of whiskey?<br> I'll call you later.<br> Well...<br> She was right to leave me.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yeah.<br> You really are stupid, you know that?<br> You don't know nothing about it.<br> Look,<br> you know, I was raised<br> that a girl gets married young.<br> I held out for love.<br> I got married when I was 28.<br> I met a man, I loved him, I married him.<br> He wanted to have a baby right away.<br> I said we should wait.<br> Then he gets hit by a bus.<br> So what do I got?<br> I got no man, no baby, no nothing.<br> How did I know that<br> that man was a gift I couldn't keep?<br> My one chance of happiness.<br> You tell me the story<br> and act like you know what it means.<br> But I can see<br> what the true story is and you can't.<br> That woman didn't leave you.<br> You can't see what you are<br> and I see everything.<br> You're a wolf.<br> - I'm a wolf?<br> - Yeah.<br> The...<br> The big part of you has no words and<br> it's a wolf.<br> That woman was a trap for you.<br> You couldn't get away,<br> so you chewed off your own foot.<br> That was the price of your freedom.<br> Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did<br> what you had to do between you and you.<br> And now you're afraid because you<br> know the big part of you is a wolf<br> that has the courage to bite off its hand<br> to escape from the trap of the wrong love.<br> That's why there's been no woman<br> since that wrong woman. OK?<br> You're scared of what the wolf will do<br> if you slip up again.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Telling you your life.<br> - Stop it.<br> - No.<br> Why are you marrying Johnny?<br> He's a fool.<br> Because I have no luck.<br> He made me look the wrong way<br> and I cut off my hand.<br> If you look the wrong way,<br> you could lose your head.<br> I'm looking where I have to to be a bride.<br> - A bride without a head.<br> - A wolf without a foot!<br> Wait a minute! Wait a minute!<br> What are you doing?<br> Son of a bitch!<br> Where are you taking me?<br> To the bed.<br> Oh, God! OK, I don't care, I don't care.<br> Take me, take me to the bed.<br> I don't care about anything.<br> I don't believe this is happening.<br> - I was dead.<br> - Me, too.<br> - What about Johnny?<br> - You're mad at him.<br> Take your revenge out on me.<br> Leave nothing left for him to marry,<br> nothing but the skin over my bones.<br> All right, there will be nothing left.<br> - Let's eat while it's hot.<br> - Where's Loretta, huh?<br> - She must be eating out.<br> - She don't know what she's missing!<br> It's not like her not to call.<br> Well, she's got a lot on her mind.<br> We can talk about it, right?<br> Everybody knows.<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> Johnny Cammareri.<br> I think it's a great idea and about time.<br> What is she gonna do with the rest<br> of her life if she don't get married?<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> My father needs another plate.<br> Cosmo, many years ago,<br> when they told me<br> you were marrying my sister,<br> I was happy.<br> When I told Rose that I was marrying Rita,<br> she was happy.<br> Well, marriage is happy news, right?<br> Rose, pass the wine.<br> I never seen anybody so in love<br> like Cosmo was back then.<br> He'd stand outside the house all day<br> looking in the windows.<br> I never told you this,<br> cos it's not really a story.<br> But one time,<br> I woke up in the middle of the night<br> cos of this bright light in my face.<br> Like a flashlight.<br> I couldn't think of what it was.<br> I looked out the window<br> and it was the moon,<br> as big as a house.<br> I never seen the moon so big<br> before or since.<br> I was almost scared,<br> like it was gonna crush the house.<br> Then I looked down, and standing there<br> in the street was Cosmo<br> looking up at the windows.<br> This is the funny part!<br> I got mad at you, Cosmo.<br> I thought you had brought<br> that big moon over to my house,<br> because you were so in love<br> and woke me up with it.<br> I was half-asleep, I guess.<br> You were altogether asleep.<br> You were dreaming.<br> No.<br> You were there.<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> Well, what do you wanna talk about?<br> Why are you drinking so much?<br> Old man! You give those dogs<br> another piece of my food,<br> I'm gonna kick you till you're dead.<br> Cosmo.<br> Cosmo!<br> You drank too much.<br> Now you'll sleep too hard and later<br> you'll be up when you should be down.<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.<br> It's perfect.<br> I never seen a moon like that before.<br> It makes you look like an angel.<br> It looks like a<br> giant snowball.<br> - Rita.<br> - What?<br> - Rita, dear.<br> - What?<br> - Wake up!<br> - What?<br> Look.<br> Oh.<br> It's Cosmo's moon.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Cosmo can't own the moon.<br> It's that moon I was talking about<br> at dinner.<br> Is he down there?<br> Is who down there?<br> Cosmo.<br> - What would he be doing down there?<br> - I don't know.<br> You know something?<br> In that light,<br> with that expression on your face,<br> you look about 25 years old.<br> - Rita.<br> - What do you want?<br> Get out, get out!<br> - Rita...<br> - No!<br> Piano!<br> Ho detto di non tirare!<br> Piano.<br> Piano, piano, piano.<br> Non tirare. Non tirare!<br> E guardate la luna.<br> Guardate la bella luna!<br> Guarda!<br> Ah, veramente una luna bella.<br> Ma guardate.<br> Ma non gi! Su! Guardate su!<br> Why do you make me wait?<br> Come on, come on!<br> Howl, howl!<br> Hey, howl, come on!<br> Guarda la luna!<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - What?<br> - What?!<br> - Take it easy.<br> - This time I wanted to do it right.<br> - Don't become excited.<br> I thought if I didn't go to the City Hall,<br> I wouldn't have bad luck.<br> - You make me feel guilty.<br> - I'm marrying your brother!<br> All right, I'm guilty. I confess.<br> The wedding's in two weeks.<br> You're invited.<br> How come you didn't<br> be with your mother in Palermo?<br> She don't like me.<br> You don't get along with anybody,<br> do you?<br> - What did you do?<br> - What did I do?!<br> - You ruined my life.<br> - That's impossible.<br> It was ruined when I got here.<br> You ruined my life.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - Oh, yes, you did.<br> Oh, yes, you did.<br> You've got them bad eyes, like a gypsy.<br> Why didn't I see it yesterday?<br> Bad luck, that's it.<br> Is that all I'm ever gonna have?<br> I should have taken a rock<br> and killed myself years ago.<br> I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?<br> Last night never happened.<br> I'm gonna marry him.<br> You and I are gonna take this<br> to our coffins.<br> - I can't do that?<br> - Why not?<br> I'm in love with you.<br> - Snap out of it!<br> - I can't.<br> Then I must never see you again<br> and the bad blood will have to stay<br> between you and Johnny.<br> - And you won't come to the wedding.<br> - I will.<br> - I'm telling you, you can't!<br> - He wants me to come.<br> That's because he don't know, OK?<br> Now wait a minute, honey.<br> Listen, all right.<br> I won't come to the wedding<br> provided one thing.<br> - What?<br> - Come with me tonight to the opera.<br> - What are you talking about?!<br> - I love two things.<br> I love you and... and I love the opera.<br> If I can have the two things I love<br> together for one night,<br> I would be satisfied to give up...<br> Oh, Christ, to give up the rest of my life.<br> - All right, all right.<br> - All right.<br> All right!<br> - Meet me at the Met.<br> - All right, all right.<br> - Where's the Met?<br> - Well, you gotta...<br> Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.<br> It's two months since my last confession.<br> What sins have you to confess?<br> Twice I took the Lord's name in vain,<br> once I slept with my fianc's brother,<br> and I bounced a check<br> at the liquor store, but by mistake.<br> Then it's not a sin.<br> But,<br> what was that second thing you said,<br> Loretta?<br> You mean the one about<br> I slept with my fianc's brother?<br> That's a pretty big sin.<br> - I know.<br> - You should think about this.<br> I know.<br> All right.<br> For your penance, say two rosaries.<br> Be careful, Loretta.<br> Reflect on your life.<br> All right.<br> Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris,<br> Filii et Spiritus Sancti.<br> Amen.<br> Hi.<br> - Where you been?<br> - I don't wanna talk about it.<br> Just like your father.<br> I lied to him.<br> He thinks you came home last night.<br> Thanks.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Cosmo's cheating on me.<br> What? How do you know this?<br> A wife knows.<br> You don't even know.<br> You're just imagining it. He's too old.<br> I won't be home for dinner.<br> I feel great!<br> I got no sleep,<br> but I feel like Orlando Furioso.<br> You were a tiger last night.<br> And you were a lamb. As soft as... milk.<br> Ssh! They'll hear you in the back.<br> The pleasure of marriage is you sleep<br> with the woman and worry about nothing.<br> - Be quiet, Raymond!<br> - Hey! How about a date tonight?<br> - What's the matter with you?!<br> - We'll eat some pasta...<br> - What's got into you?<br> - I don't know. I really don't know.<br> That moon...<br> That crazy moon Cosmo sent over.<br> Hi, Rita. Hi, Uncle Raymond.<br> Hey, there!<br> - What's the matter with him?<br> - You got me.<br> - Did you see that moon last night?<br> - What... what moon?<br> - Did you see it?<br> - No.<br> I gotta go.<br> I'll take the deposit to the bank,<br> but I gotta do the books tomorrow.<br> Oh, sure. You got a date.<br> What are you talking about, you fool?<br> Her fianc's in Palermo. What date?!<br> Oh. Right.<br> I just got a lot of things to do.<br> - All that wedding stuff, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey! That's romantic, too.<br> Hey, Frankie!<br> Make me a bowl of minestrone!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You look crazy.<br> - I got a lot on my mind.<br> - What?<br> - I got a lot on my mind...<br> - Don't say that.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - I don't wanna talk about it!<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> Take out the grey.<br> I have wanted to do this for three years!<br> Let me show you some magazines.<br> And then you need a manicure, yes.<br> You take her, Bettina. Take out the grey.<br> - Finalmente, che brutta!<br> - And someone has to do the eyebrows...<br> Wait a minute, wait...<br> - Has anybody here been to the opera?<br> - Not me.<br> Bellissima without those ugly greys.<br> It's fantastic.<br> - Have you ever been to the opera?<br> - No. Have you?<br> Ow!<br> Bettina, you ever been to the opera?<br> - I never been.<br> - You going to the Met?<br> Yes.<br> She turned 40 and her husband left her.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - OK, OK, OK.<br> - Wow.<br> - Look at that.<br> Careful.<br> Hi, I'm home!<br> Don't everybody answer at the same time.<br> Hello!<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> You look beautiful.<br> - Your hair.<br> - Yeah, I had it done.<br> - You look beautiful, too.<br> - Thank you.<br> No.<br> I said I'd go to the opera with you,<br> but... that's all.<br> Come on, let's go in.<br> - Oh, look at that.<br> - It's something, isn't it?<br> Wow! Thank you.<br> For what?<br> I don't know. For your hair.<br> For your beautiful dress.<br> I don't know. It's been a long time<br> since I've been to the opera.<br> So where are we sitting?<br> Come on.<br> Here we go.<br> - So. Who's coming?<br> - Just me. I want to eat.<br> OK. I got a table for you right now.<br> - This all right?<br> - Fine.<br> - Enjoy your meal, Mrs Castorini.<br> - Thanks.<br> Signora Castorini,<br> you dining alone tonight?<br> Hello, Bobo, yeah.<br> Let me have a martini, no ice, two olives.<br> Ah, very good.<br> When I tell you how I feel,<br> you tell me how you feel.<br> - That's not much of a response.<br> - It's the only response I've got.<br> - You want something to eat?<br> - Not now. I'll wave.<br> Very good.<br> I really hate it<br> when you use that tone with me.<br> Like isn't it so amusing.<br> - But it is.<br> - Not to me!<br> This is my life, no matter<br> how comical it may seem to you.<br> I don't need some man watching<br> while I roll around in the mud.<br> I think you like to roll around in the mud<br> and I don't. That's fair...<br> Sorry about that, folks.<br> She's a very pretty mental patient.<br> No, don't...<br> No, no, no. Please, don't mind me.<br> Just do me a favour and clear her place.<br> Get rid of all evidence of her<br> and bring me a big glass of vodka.<br> Absolutely.<br> I'm sorry if we disturbed you.<br> I'm not disturbed by you.<br> My lady friend has a personality disorder.<br> She's just too young for you.<br> - Ah, thanks, comrade.<br> - It's nothing.<br> Too young?<br> I just got that.<br> You know how to hurt a guy.<br> - How old are you?<br> - None of your business.<br> I'm sorry. That was rude.<br> Would you like to join me for dinner?<br> Are you sure?<br> I'd be delighted.<br> I hate to eat alone. It's amazing<br> how often I end up doing just that.<br> Signora Castorini... your minestrone.<br> - Thanks, Bobo.<br> - Prego.<br> What do you do?<br> I'm a professor of communication at NYU.<br> - That woman was a student of yours?<br> - Sheila? Yeah, she was.<br> Is.<br> Was.<br> There's an old saying<br> my mother taught me.<br> Don't shit where you eat.<br> OK, I'll remember that.<br> - What do you do?<br> - I'm a housewife.<br> - How come you're eating alone?<br> - I'm not eating alone.<br> - May I ask you a question?<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> Why do men chase women?<br> Nerves.<br> I think it's because they fear death.<br> Well, maybe.<br> Do you wanna know why I chase women?<br> I find women charming.<br> I teach these classes<br> I've taught for a million years.<br> The spontaneity went out of it for me<br> a long time ago.<br> At first, I was excited about something,<br> I wanted to share it. Now it's rote.<br> A multiplication table.<br> Except sometimes...<br> Sometimes, I'll be droning along<br> and I'll look up and I'll see a fresh,<br> beautiful young face.<br> And it's all new to her.<br> I'm just this great guy<br> who's brilliant and thinks out loud.<br> When that happens,<br> when I look out there among those chairs,<br> and see a young woman's face<br> and see me in her eyes,<br> me, the way I always wanted to be,<br> maybe once was,<br> I ask her out for a date.<br> It doesn't last long.<br> A few weeks,<br> a couple of precious months.<br> Then she catches on that<br> I'm just this burned-out old gasbag<br> and she's as fresh and bright<br> and full of promise<br> as moonlight in a martini.<br> And at that moment she stands up<br> and throws a glass of water in my face<br> or some action to that effect.<br> What you don't know<br> about women is a lot.<br> Well... that's not what I hear.<br> - Two white wines, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'd like two glasses of champagne.<br> Canadian Club with ginger ale<br> and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.<br> - What's that?<br> - This was done by Marc Chagall.<br> As you can see, he was a great artist.<br> - It's kinda gaudy.<br> - He was having some fun.<br> They get some turnout for this stuff, huh?<br> It's the best thing there is.<br> You know, I like parts of it,<br> but I just don't... really get it.<br> You haven't once said you like my dress.<br> I like your dress.<br> It's very bright. Oh...<br> Will you hold this? Thanks.<br> May I walk with you a ways?<br> Sure. Thanks.<br> - Do you live far from here?<br> - Just up there.<br> - You knew that man?<br> - Yes.<br> That was so awful.<br> - Awful?<br> - Beautiful! Sad.<br> - She died.<br> - Yes.<br> I couldn't believe it.<br> I didn't think she would die.<br> - I knew she was sick, but...<br> - She had TB.<br> I know! She was coughing her brains out.<br> And still she had to keep singing.<br> Pop.<br> Pop, what are you doing here?<br> Wait for me by the doors, Mona.<br> - Mona?<br> - Excuse me!<br> - What did you do to your hair?<br> - I... had it done.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Who's that? You're engaged.<br> - You're married.<br> You're my daughter.<br> Don't act like a puttana.<br> - And you're my father...<br> - All right.<br> I didn't see you here.<br> I don't know if I saw you here or what.<br> Let's get outta here.<br> I'll buy you a drink.<br> That woman was not my mother, OK?<br> That's my house.<br> - You mean the whole house?<br> - Yes.<br> My God! It's a mansion.<br> It's a house.<br> I live in a one-bedroom apartment.<br> What exactly does your husband do?<br> He's a plumber.<br> Well, that explains it, then.<br> Temperature's dropping.<br> - I guess you can't invite me in.<br> - No.<br> People home.<br> No. I think the house is empty.<br> I can't invite you in because I'm married.<br> Because I know who I am.<br> - You're shivering.<br> - I'm a little cold.<br> You're a little boy. And you like to be bad.<br> We could go to my apartment.<br> See how the other half lives.<br> I'm too old for you.<br> I'm too old for me.<br> That's my predicament.<br> Goodnight.<br> Goodnight.<br> Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?<br> Sure.<br> I'm freezing.<br> Goodnight.<br> Goodnight.<br> Anything else, folks?<br> - Loretta?<br> - No.<br> - I think that's it, Al.<br> - See you, Al!<br> - What do you wanna do now?<br> - I wanna go home.<br> - Goodnight, Al.<br> - Take it easy, Ronny.<br> God, it's cold.<br> It smells like snow.<br> You know, my mother guessed<br> my father was seeing somebody.<br> That Mona, I mean,<br> she's some piece of cheap goods.<br> Who am I to talk?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - How can you ask me that?<br> - You're making me feel guilty.<br> - You are guilty! I'm guilty.<br> Of what?<br> Only God can point the finger, Loretta.<br> - Yeah, well, I know what I know.<br> - And what do you know?<br> OK, you tell me my life.<br> I'll tell you yours.<br> I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me.<br> That don't make you no lamb.<br> You're gonna marry my brother.<br> Why do you wanna sell your life short?<br> Playing it safe's the most dangerous<br> thing a woman like you could do.<br> I mean, you waited for<br> the right man the first time.<br> - Why didn't you wait for him again?<br> - Because he didn't come.<br> - I'm here.<br> - You're late.<br> This is your place.<br> So this is where we were going.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, we had a deal.<br> You said if I came with you to the opera<br> you'd leave me alone for ever.<br> And I came with you!<br> I'm gonna marry your brother and you're<br> gonna leave me alone for ever, right?<br> A person can see<br> where they've messed up in their life.<br> They can change the way they do things.<br> They can even change their luck.<br> So maybe my nature does draw me<br> to you. But I don't have to go with it.<br> I can take hold of myself<br> and I can say yes to some things<br> and no to other things<br> that will ruin everything.<br> Otherwise, you know, what...<br> What good is this stupid life<br> that God gave us? I mean, for what?<br> Are you listening to me?!<br> Yeah.<br> Everything seems like nothing to me now.<br> I want you in my bed.<br> I don't care if I burn in hell.<br> I don't care if you burn in hell.<br> The past and the future is<br> a joke to me now.<br> I see that they're nothing,<br> I see they ain't here.<br> The only thing that's here<br> is you... and me.<br> - I wanna go home.<br> - No.<br> - I'm gonna go home.<br> - No!<br> - I'm freezing to death.<br> - Come upstairs.<br> I don't care why you come.<br> No, that's not what I mean.<br> Loretta,<br> I love you.<br> Not... not like they told you love is.<br> I didn't know this either.<br> But love don't make things nice.<br> It ruins everything.<br> It breaks your heart.<br> It makes things a mess.<br> We aren't here to make things perfect.<br> - The snowflakes are perfect...<br> - Oh!<br> The stars are perfect.<br> Not us. Not us!<br> We are here to ruin ourselves<br> and... and to break our hearts<br> and love the wrong people.<br> And die!<br> I mean that the storybooks are bullshit!<br> Now I want you to come upstairs with me<br> and get in my bed!<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Got it.<br> Hold it!<br> - How much?<br> - 25.<br> - 25 dollars?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hold it.<br> Hey!<br> Oh, hi. I'm sorry to call so late.<br> Moving in?<br> No, I came right from the airport.<br> Come on in.<br> Can you wake up Loretta?<br> I need to talk to her.<br> She's not home yet. Take off your coat<br> and come through. I'll make you a drink.<br> I wanna talk to you!<br> Thank you. Where is she?<br> Out. I don't know where.<br> So. What are you doing here?<br> You're supposed to be in Palermo.<br> This is what I came to tell Loretta.<br> There's been a miracle.<br> A miracle? Well, that's news.<br> My mother's recovered.<br> - You're kidding?<br> - Oh, no.<br> The breath had almost totally left<br> her body. She was as white as snow.<br> And then,<br> she completely pulled back from death,<br> and stood up... and put on her clothes,<br> and began to cook<br> for everyone in the house.<br> The mourners, and me, and herself.<br> She ate a meal that could choke a pig.<br> - That's incredible.<br> - Yes.<br> Hi, Pop.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Is he all right?<br> My father-in-law's got<br> this wrong idea in his head.<br> Listen, Johnny.<br> There's a question I want to ask.<br> I want you to tell me the truth...<br> if you can.<br> Why do men chase women?<br> Well uh...<br> There's the Bible story.<br> God.<br> God took a rib from Adam...<br> and made Eve.<br> Now, maybe men chase women<br> to get the rib back.<br> When God took the rib,<br> he left a big hole there.<br> A place where<br> there used to be something.<br> And the women have that.<br> Now maybe,<br> just maybe,<br> a man isn't complete as a man,<br> without a woman.<br> Why would a man need<br> more than one woman?<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe because he fears death.<br> That's it. That's the reason.<br> - I don't know!<br> - No!<br> That's it. No. Thank you.<br> Thank you for answering my question.<br> Hi.<br> Hello, Mr Castorini.<br> Oh. Hi.<br> Where you been?<br> I don't know where I've been<br> and I don't know where I'm going.<br> All right?<br> You'll have your eyes opened for you,<br> my friend.<br> - I have my eyes open.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Well, stick around.<br> Don't go on any long trips.<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> - That's the point. I'll say no more.<br> You haven't said anything.<br> And that's all I'm saying.<br> - Cosmo.<br> - What?<br> I just want you to know,<br> no matter what you do,<br> you're gonna die,<br> just like everybody else.<br> Thank you, Rose.<br> You're welcome.<br> I'm going to bed now.<br> I'm going.<br> Good.<br> He doesn't like you.<br> But thank you for answering my question.<br> - You don't know where Loretta is?<br> - No. No idea.<br> Mrs Castorini, will you tell Loretta<br> that I'll come by in the morning?<br> - We... We need to talk.<br> - OK, I'll tell her. OK.<br> Thank you.<br> Watch it! The house!<br> What the hell happened to you?<br> I really don't know where to start.<br> - Your hair's different.<br> - Ma, everything is different.<br> - Are you drunk?<br> - No. Are you drunk?<br> No. But I have a hangover.<br> - Where's Pop?<br> - Upstairs.<br> Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.<br> What?! He's in Sicily.<br> - No more, he's not.<br> - He's there with his dying mother.<br> - She recovered.<br> - She was dying!<br> It was a miracle.<br> This is modern times!<br> There ain't supposed to be miracles.<br> I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily.<br> He came right from the airport.<br> He wanted to talk to you.<br> You got a lovebite on your neck.<br> He's coming back this morning.<br> Your life's going down the toilet.<br> Cover up that damn thing!<br> Put some make-up on it!<br> All right! Ma, OK, fine!<br> But you gotta help me.<br> Hurry up...<br> You get it.<br> Answer the door!<br> Mother?<br> Hi.

I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.<br> I'm Rose Castorini.<br> - It's nice to meet you.<br> - It's nice to meet you.<br> You got a lovebite on your neck.<br> - Your mother's recovered from death.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - We're not close. I'm not...<br> - Ouch!<br> - You gotta leave.<br> - I want to meet the family.<br> No. Really, you gotta get out of here.<br> - Anyone want some oatmeal?<br> - No, Ma.<br> Yes, Mrs Castorini. I would love some.<br> No, we don't want any oatmeal.<br> Ma!<br> That was a... This is a... Oh!<br> - Thanks, Ma.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.<br> It's very good to meet you, Mr Castorini.<br> I have a feeling<br> this is going to be just delicious.<br> - You're Johnny's brother?<br> - Yeah.<br> Don't look at me like that, OK?<br> Hi, Pop.<br> - What's the matter, Pop?<br> - I'm old.<br> The old are not wanted.<br> And if they say it, they have no weight.<br> But, my son... I must speak.<br> You must pay for the wedding<br> of your only daughter.<br> You break your house through pride.<br> There.<br> - I... I've said it.<br> - It's OK, Pop.<br> If she gets married...<br> I'll pay for the whole thing.<br> Now you're talking.<br> Let's eat.<br> Have I been a good wife?<br> Yeah.<br> I want you to stop seeing her.<br> OK.<br> And go to confession.<br> A man understands one day<br> that his life is built on nothing<br> and that's a bad, crazy day.<br> Your life is not built on nothing.<br> - It's Johnny, I'll get it.<br> - I'll get it.<br> - I should tell him.<br> - I will.<br> What am I gonna tell him?<br> Tell him the truth, Loretta.<br> They find out anyway.<br> You're right, Papa.<br> - Hi, Loretta.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, Loretta.<br> - Hi.<br> Why aren't you two at the store?<br> Do you have something<br> you wanna tell us, honey?<br> No.<br> We just come from the bank.<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, my God! I forgot to make the deposit!<br> Oh, she's got it.<br> - I knew she had it!<br> - We didn't know what to think.<br> You were so weird yesterday.<br> And then we went to the bank<br> this morning, and no bag.<br> We never suspected you.<br> Listen, would anyone like some coffee?<br> That's a good idea.<br> - What's with this suspected?<br> - I'll tell you later.<br> I forgot to make the deposit.<br> Sit down. Have some coffee.<br> - So what are we doing?<br> - Waiting. For Johnny Cammareri.<br> My name's Ronny.<br> Johnny's brother.<br> Oh. Nice to meet you.<br> I'm Rita Cappomaggi.<br> - Raymond Cappomaggi. Rose's brother.<br> - Hi.<br> Someone tell a joke.<br> I'll get it.<br> I thought Johnny was in Palermo.<br> It's Johnny Cammareri!<br> Loretta?<br> Ronny!<br> - Have you come to make peace with me?<br> - Yes.<br> But...<br> you may not want to.<br> Ronny, of course I want to.<br> Johnny, your mother was dying.<br> How did she recover?<br> I told her we were to be married<br> and she got well right away!<br> - I'm sure she did!<br> - It was a miracle.<br> Johnny,<br> I have something I have to tell you.<br> And I have something to tell you.<br> But I must talk to you alone.<br> No, I need my family around me now.<br> Loretta,<br> I can't marry you.<br> What?!<br> - If I marry you, my mother will die!<br> - What do you mean? We're engaged!<br> Loretta, what are you talking about?<br> I'm talking about a promise?<br> He proposed!<br> My mother was dying and now she's not!<br> You're 42 years old.<br> She's still running your life.<br> And you don't love your mother!<br> You are a big liar.<br> Because I have a ring right here.<br> Oh, I must ask for that back.<br> - All right. The engagement is off!<br> - You will see this is the best thing.<br> And you'll drop dead<br> and I'll mourn you in a red dress!<br> - Loretta...<br> - What?<br> - Will you marry me?<br> - What?!<br> Where's the ring?<br> Johnny.<br> Can I borrow that ring?<br> Thanks.<br> Loretta Castorini,<br> will you marry me?<br> Yes, Ronny.<br> In front of all these people, I'll marry you.<br> - Do you love him, Loretta?<br> - Ma, I love him awful.<br> Oh, God. That's too bad.<br> She loves me.<br> What's the matter, Pop?<br> I'm confused.<br> To Loretta and Ronny!<br> There we are! Thank you, thank you.<br> Come on, Raymond!<br> - Come, come. Your brother is here and...<br> - No, I don't want any.<br> You are a part of the family.<br> Don't you realise? Come on, bevi!<br> Everybody, come on!
