Hi.<br> Thanks for having dinner so early.<br> I know it's... it's a pain.<br> No, that's, that's...<br> Interesting crowd.<br> Yeah. My job is the problem.<br> I'm... I work at<br> Good Morning, New Jersey and...<br> - Right, on channel nine. Right?<br> - Right. Yeah.<br> So, yeah, we're on really early, so I...<br> I go to bed really early and<br> we used to be on at, 5am,<br> but then we got bought by this<br> giant company and they wanted<br> to run us instead of infomercials.<br> 'Cause we generate<br> slightly more revenue and...<br> Now we're on at four.<br> Sorry, I'm gonna turn this off.<br> It's so...<br> Sorry. That's like, oh, my God,<br> that's so annoying<br> when people do this.<br> It's like, "check, please."<br> I'm not gonna touch this...<br> ever again. Sorry.<br> No, that's, it's... it's OK.<br> It's OK.<br> I...<br> I'm... I'm really glad that<br> you picked this place. I...<br> You know, it kind of reminds me<br> of Matthews in Waldwick.<br> They have the most amazing, like,<br> delicious, thick, big, juicy...<br> Lots of Belgian waffles<br> and syrup in the...<br> And...<br> Anyway... boring!<br> What do you do?<br> - Anna told me you're in...<br> - Marketing.<br> - Right.<br> - For an insurance company,<br> and I dabble in ceramics, but...<br> Take it.<br> Sorry, it's... I... This is my boss.<br> - Go ahead. Take it.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - OK, great, thanks.<br> Just be a sec. Promise.<br> Hi! Yeah, yeah.<br> I left three messages<br> for his attorney. I don't know.<br> If he doesn't call me back, I'm gonna...<br> I'll wait outside his office.<br> - Good morning, Becky.<br> - 'Night, Jim.<br> Good morning, New Jersey,<br> it's 2am.<br> We cover the Garden State<br> from corner to corner.<br> ...the perfect alternative...<br> New Jersey Transit is reporting<br> a 20-minute delay...<br> ...come out in support<br> of your local eateries.<br> Powerball Lottery jackpot...<br> Right in the base...<br> Yes, but I did it in<br> a really adorable way.<br> Rent a mini-rig. Cheaper and we can<br> get closer to the action.<br> I was thinking we'd get someone<br> in the winner's circle.<br> A pinata?<br> You can do the pinata?<br> - I can do it.<br> - Yeah? OK.<br> - Four... three...<br> - Thank you, thank you.<br> Ready to dissolve to jib.<br> Jib, ready to make your move.<br> Ten seconds to air,<br> everybody.<br> Ready to roll track<br> and fade up under one.<br> ...three, two... one.<br> Roll track and fade up under one.<br> Good morning, New Jersey.<br> A quick look at traffic now.<br> Holland Tunnel is backed up<br> 'cause of an overturned big rig<br> in the right and center lanes.<br> Officials say this should be cleared up<br> in about an hour.<br> So then, expect delays<br> from Ridgefield Park.<br> - But until then, you should...<br> - Is that snoring?<br> Jesus. Not again. Can you<br> go to the single of Ralph?<br> - Harry, Harry.<br> - The Deko!<br> - Wrong lower third!<br> - The Deko!<br> ...the hidden dangers<br> that could be in your home.<br> All that and a look at sports<br> at the top of the hour.<br> Stick with us here<br> at Good Morning, New Jersey.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Nice shot.

You told them<br> you can't do that, right?<br> Because I... I've been here so long<br> and I've worked so hard.<br> His name is Chip.<br> He's... Chip starts Monday.<br> He has an M.B.A. And<br> a journalism degree from Columbia.<br> They're grooming him to run<br> the whole station in a few years.<br> In the meantime, I can't afford<br> to keep you both.<br> - Becky, look, I'm really...<br> - Oh, shit.<br> Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.<br> Shitty...<br> Becky, I... I'm so sorry.<br> I'm so, so sorry.<br> - I fought them as hard as I could.<br> - There's lots of terrific<br> opportunities out there, you know?<br> I mean, look at Chip. He got one.<br> So maybe this is just the push<br> I need, you know?<br> So it can get me to the next level,<br> maybe even to a network or...<br> - Yeah.<br> - I mean, it's not like<br> it's my whole life.<br> It's only work, right?<br> Did you get any severance?<br> There were some budgetary cuts<br> last year,<br> so they weren't really offering.<br> But I have feelers out. Lots.<br> - Yeah, great.<br> - Honey, you think the Today show<br> is gonna call you up and hand you a job,<br> you have since you were eight,<br> - and it's not gonna happen.<br> - I don't, I know that, I do, I get it.<br> This is partly my fault. I...<br> I let your father get your hopes up.<br> He was not a happy person,<br> let's face it.<br> When he saw you aim high, he started<br> to feel better about himself,<br> - so I never said anything.<br> - What are you saying?<br> You had a dream, you know? Great.<br> When you were eight, it was adorable.<br> When you were 18, it was inspiring.<br> At 28, it's officially embarrassing.<br> And I just want you to stop<br> before we get to heartbreaking.<br> The troops are involved in projects...<br> Waiting arrival...<br> On my BlackBerry,<br> it shows that you got my e-mail,<br> so I was just wondering if... Yeah,<br> it shows when someone's opened it.<br> Hello?<br> Becky Fuller. Yeah.<br> I wanted to make sure that you got<br> the resume that I e-mailed you.<br> You did. Great.<br> Becky Fuller again.<br> I was just wondering if...<br> Yes, I did call yesterday,<br> but I updated my resume last night<br> and thought you might...<br> I'm calling because I was<br> checking up on the position<br> and I was wondering if it had been...<br> - Hi, Becky Fuller.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi, this is Jerry Barnes calling<br> from IBS in New York. How are you?<br> - Good.<br> - Terrific. Listen, I'm calling<br> 'cause I received your resume,<br> all five of them, actually.<br> And it just so happens,<br> that we're looking for somebody<br> at the moment.<br> I'll take it.<br> Well, wait, I haven't<br> told you what it is yet.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Well, our morning show<br> - has a vacancy and so...<br> - I'll take it!<br> We're interviewing a bunch of people.<br> Maybe you can come in<br> - and we can have a talk.<br> - Sure! Absolutely.<br> Just tell me where to go<br> and who to talk to.<br> OK, I'll get you an e-mail with the<br> details of where we are in the city.<br> - Sorry!<br> - And shall we say 3:00?<br> Thank you, thank you!<br> Oscar says you're very talented<br> and you work incredibly hard.<br> Says you're the most promising<br> producer that he's ever fired.<br> Well, that's, that's good. I think.<br> So you're a fan<br> of our morning program?<br> - Yeah, I think it has so many...<br> - Yeah, yeah, we know it's terrible.<br> Perpetually in fourth place behind<br> the Today show, Good Morning America<br> and that thing on CBS,<br> whatever it's called.<br> It's a source of constant humiliation.<br> Last year, in the network softball<br> league, the CBS team wore hats<br> that said,<br> "At least we're not Daybreak."<br> The anchors of the show<br> are difficult and semi-talented.<br> - I think Colleen Peck is a pro.<br> - Heinous.<br> - Paul McVee is a fine reporter.<br> - Foul.<br> OK. Is Daybreak a shitty show? Yes.<br> But it's on a network.<br> And not just any network.<br> This is one of the most legendary<br> news divisions in the entire history<br> of television! Daybreak just needs<br> someone who believes in it,<br> who understands that a national<br> platform is an invaluable resource,<br> that no story is too low<br> or too high to reach for!<br> Are you gonna... sing?<br> Look, Mr. Barnes. Jerry.<br> Daybreak's facilities are antiquated.<br> It's understaffed, underfunded.<br> And the pay.<br> It's awful, about half<br> of what you made at<br> Hey, How The Hell Are You, New Jersey?<br> You've never been an<br> executive producer. You're too young.<br> Nobody's ever heard of ya. And here,<br> your education, three, not four years,<br> at Fairleigh Dickinson in Teaneck,<br> also known as Fairly Ridiculous.<br> Did I miss anything?<br> Daybreak needs what I need,<br> someone who believes<br> that it can succeed.<br> Trust me, I know you don't<br> have any reason to believe in me,<br> but I work harder than anyone else.<br> I'm in first, I'm out last.<br> I know a shitload more about the news<br> than someone whose daddy paid them<br> to smoke bongs<br> and talk semiotics at Harvard<br> and I devote myself completely<br> to my job. It's what I do.<br> It's all I am. I...<br> You can ask anyone.<br> Well, that's... embarrassing.<br> OK.<br> Thanks for the tour,<br> and... thanks for... for...<br> Thanks.<br> It's these buttons right here.<br> Oh, lobby. Yes, thanks.<br> Good day so far?<br> I don't think so.<br> I talked too much. Ruined it.<br> Damn it.<br> Sir.<br> I am such a huge admirer of yours.<br> I'm a... I'm a big, huge fan. I...<br> My whole family watched you,<br> growing up. I...<br> Of all the anchors, you were,<br> by far, the greatest reporter.<br> I mean when you were<br> in Kosovo, I was in Kosovo.<br> - She work for you?<br> - No.<br> I'm just here to teach her<br> how to use the elevator.<br> Are you done?<br> Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<br> May I?<br> Oh, God, sorry. I...<br> Of course, of course.<br> Oh, my God, I can't<br> believe I just met the...<br> - Wait a second. You know him.<br> - Yes, I do know him.<br> He's the third worst person<br> in the world.<br> - Hello?<br> - Becky Fuller.<br> - Yes?<br> - You sure you can do this job?<br> Yes.<br> - You start on Monday.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yes, I am calling about<br> the one-bedroom.<br> Yes, I'm moving into town.<br> I've got a new job.<br> I'm extremely neat and tidy.<br> In summer camp the kids used<br> to pay me to make their beds.<br> Yeah.<br> Sorry, that was an overshare.<br> No loud music. No kids.<br> I don't even have a boyfriend.<br> Just me.<br> I'll take it. I'll take it,<br> I'll take it.<br> Sorry!<br> Sorry!<br> Sorry!<br> Also, we'll have more<br> on the flooding in Iowa.<br> Finally, some good weather news<br> on the way for those folks.<br> So please join us tomorrow<br> and thank you for spending<br> - your morning here at Daybreak.<br> - Take care, everyone.<br> - Are you interviewing at Daybreak?<br> - Goodbye.<br> Assistant? Intern?<br> No. Actually,<br> I'm the new executive producer.<br> Another one?<br> Don't unpack.<br> Miss Fuller?<br> Lenny Bergman, Senior Producer.<br> Yes. I know who you are.<br> You started out at WABC.<br> You were at CBS for two years<br> - and here for 13.<br> - Yeah, wow.<br> - Here, let me, let me give you a hand.<br> - I just have one question.<br> Why haven't they bumped you up?<br> It's not for me. I did it<br> for a couple of weeks once,<br> but they put me back at number two.<br> Apparently, the crying was distracting.<br> You'll love it, though.<br> It's a great job.<br> - Our morning meetings are at five.<br> - Isn't that kind of late?<br> - Late?<br> - I mean, it's just that...<br> I'm, I'm used to early hours, so...<br> Well, maybe we should<br> try better doughnuts.<br> Excuse me. At the Today show,<br> the senior staff is usually...<br> Hi... in by 4:30...<br> We're just like the Today show,<br> except, you know, without the money,<br> - viewers, respect. But very similar.<br> - OK.<br> OK? That's...<br> that's one of our good doorknobs.<br> Let me take care of this.<br> Colleen Peck has been here forever.<br> Don't mention that.<br> But McVee is paid more.<br> Don't mention that, either.<br> They hate each other.<br> Don't mention that.<br> But that's because Colleen hates<br> everybody. Don't mention that.<br> And she used to sleep with McVee,<br> who threw her over for her assistant.<br> - Do not mention that.<br> - Got it.<br> - After you talk to Colleen...<br> - Yeah, yeah?<br> Make sure you get me before you talk<br> to McVee, so I can go with ya.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't... Just trust me, OK?<br> - OK.<br> - OK.<br> - OK.<br> - Good.<br> - Can I just...<br> - Sure. OK, you ready?<br> - I'm ready.<br> - Good luck.<br> Do you know how many EP's I've had<br> in the past 11 years?<br> Fourteen.<br> If they're stupid, they get fired,<br> and if they're smart, they quit.<br> And now look what I get.<br> Well...<br> - It's a pleasure...<br> - You think it's fun being<br> in last place?<br> Do you think I enjoy working<br> for a network that spends more<br> on one episode of a dating show<br> about a bachelor dwarf<br> than our entire weekly budget?<br> - No...<br> - And I've never had a decent<br> - co-anchor ever!<br> - We're gonna change...<br> Just a revolving door of cretinous<br> morons. Our ratings are in the crapper.<br> I mean, how long can this show<br> limp along like this?<br> I know that everyone's been through<br> a lot, and I know that there's been<br> so many challenges along the way.<br> But, you know...<br> You will fail like everyone else<br> and then you'll be gone,<br> like everyone else.<br> But I will still be here, pulling<br> the train up the hill with my teeth.<br> You think it's fun<br> getting your ass kicked?<br> - No...<br> - Welcome to Daybreak.<br> Enjoy the pain, Gidget.<br> No! It's OK. I have it!<br> I've done this a zillion times and...<br> - I'm gonna fix that and...<br> - See ya later!<br> Good talking to you.<br> Paul! Hi! I'm... I'm Becky Fuller.<br> Your new EP. Thrilled to meet you.<br> I was just thinking maybe we could<br> go over a few ideas.<br> I was thinking maybe we could<br> get you on the street<br> and do some remotes.<br> Yeah, I don't like to leave the studio.<br> I like climate control.<br> But, if you want, we could<br> discuss this further privately.<br> What size are your feet?<br> - You wear about a six and half? Seven?<br> - Pardon?<br> How do you feel about<br> having them photographed?<br> Good? Feel good about that?<br> You should.<br> I keep 'em very classy.<br> I... don't...<br> Can I show you my blog?<br> "Sexy Feet?"<br> - No.<br> - Yes?<br> No.<br> - I met Paul.<br> - You talked to him alone?<br> - I told you to come see me first.<br> - I know, but...<br> What was I gonna do?<br> Hi, everyone. Hi, I'm Becky.<br> Hi. Good morning.<br> Oh, God, look who's here.<br> I mean not here.<br> McVee. So shocking, huh?<br> Yeah, well, Mr. McVee doesn't<br> always come to these things.<br> Oh, could you tell Paul<br> that we need him, please? Thanks.<br> OK, so let's just dive in,<br> shall we?<br> Who wants to start?<br> Tomorrow Rocco DiSpirito<br> wants to make lasagna.<br> I told him we did that last week<br> with the Barefoot Contessa,<br> - but he's insisting. What do I do?<br> - For the segment on miniskirts,<br> - do you want all size models?<br> - Next week, I want to do a piece<br> on juice cleanses.<br> All the celebs are doing them<br> and they have amazing<br> powers of rejuvenization.<br> My idea is that I get a juice<br> cleanse and then we can, like,<br> - measure my toxins...<br> - For the Carville interview...<br> I'm sorry, Lisa, do you want<br> the living room set or the stools?<br> ABC says we can't have Eva Longoria<br> until two weeks after<br> - she does G.M.A. What do we do?<br> - On psychic animals,<br> would you prefer a parakeet<br> or an iguana?<br> I'd like to do a piece on weathervanes.<br> They are fascinating.<br> Like did you know the word "vane"<br> comes from the Old English "fana",<br> - which means flag or weathercock?<br> - Friday, for cooking with squash,<br> - inside or on the plaza?<br> - They're offering us the third<br> lead in the new Patrick Dempsey movie.<br> Do you want him?<br> Great story out of Tampa about<br> a retirement account scandal.<br> But we got to move quick. Should we<br> send a team or just local talent?<br> ...control room's on the fritz.<br> Ten grand to fix it.<br> For that piece on baby food,<br> do we want an actual baby,<br> and if so, white, black,<br> Hispanic, Asian,<br> blonde hair, brown hair,<br> teeth, or no teeth?<br> I have a black baby at home.<br> I'm sorry, I can't hear<br> what you're saying. I...<br> Hello! Hi, hi. Does someone<br> wanna tell me why I had to log off<br> BangingGrannies.com for this?<br> Asshole.<br> Tell Rocco if he insists on making<br> lasagna, he will be bumped.<br> Yes, all size models,<br> but skirts not too short. Toxins?<br> Who said that?<br> They can't be measured.<br> And "rejuvenization," not a word.<br> Tell Longoria's people<br> that she can't plug her next film unless<br> we get her within a week of G.M.A.<br> Parakeet. Ernie, weathercock?<br> Seriously?<br> The plaza for squash.<br> I want Patrick Dempsey.<br> Tell his people we'll run him in<br> the first hour and he can talk about<br> whatever his thing is.<br> Tampa Bay, definitely local talent.<br> And we've got to fix that sound board.<br> Find ten grand<br> in the budget somewhere.<br> The hair and makeup numbers, those<br> were too high. So, Colleen, could you<br> share your hair person with Lisa?<br> That'd be great, great. OK.<br> Asian baby, no teeth.<br> - Lesbian parents.<br> - OK.<br> Did I miss anything?<br> Oh, Paul!<br> You're fired.<br> - You're adorable.<br> - Fired!<br> I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.<br> Congratulations. The first day,<br> you flushed your anchor<br> and you got no money<br> to pay for another one.<br> He was lowering the morale of the show.<br> How is that possible?<br> Look, you must have<br> someone under contract.<br> A local anchor, a reporter.<br> I'll find someone.<br> I'll promote from within.<br> That'll be great for morale!<br> Go nuts. Find somebody great.<br> It just can't cost me a penny.<br> What if I gave them one<br> of my three pennies?<br> Whatever it takes.<br> Just get the ratings up.<br> Lenny, hi. Yeah. Very positive.<br> He thinks we have terrific options.<br> ...plunge from 200 points<br> right before closing.<br> - Analysts fear that this...<br> - He's not bad.<br> Yeah, he's OK. Put a saddle on him,<br> he's good to go.<br> ...are not happy.<br> - Should we watch 86 again?<br> I got to get home, see the kids,<br> or the wife is gonna kill me.<br> You have kids?<br> What? No.<br> No? Husband? Boyfriend?<br> Me? What? No.<br> - No, I'm sorry. Stupid question.<br> - You know...<br> - You're hideous and repulsive.<br> - You know what? Forget 86.<br> I think that we should watch the Miami<br> guy again, 'cause he was, I mean,<br> you know, he was a little bit tan,<br> but I think...<br> I think that we could wipe<br> that off, it's probably<br> just one of those self-tanner things.<br> I could, you know, fix that.<br> Good night.<br> Hey, look. It's Mike Pomeroy's fangirl.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hey.<br> That was you.<br> That was really embarrassing.<br> I may need to have you killed.<br> I'm... I'm Becky Fuller. Sorry.<br> "Becky Fuller" Becky Fuller?<br> The one who took out McVee?<br> You're a legend already.<br> - Thanks.<br> - I'm Adam Bennett.<br> I'm a producer upstairs at Seven Days.<br> - Hello.<br> - So you lookin' for a new anchor?<br> - Yes.<br> - Not that guy.<br> You can't use that guy.<br> That's the horse guy.<br> He's not too bad. I mean,<br> as long as we leave our hand flat<br> when we feed him a carrot.<br> - Well, good luck, Becky Fuller.<br> - Thank you, Adam Bennett.<br> - Need any help?<br> - No. I'm good. Thanks.<br> The sports guy from St. Louis<br> is not bad. Let's watch him again.<br> No, we need some gravitas.<br> We need people to trust us.<br> I mean, if news breaks on the air, we<br> need to be able to cover it credibly.<br> What, do you actually think<br> that we can cover breaking news?<br> - God, that's adorable.<br> - Thousands gathered today<br> to see if the tiny buck-toothed creature<br> would spot his own shadow.<br> But the sad tooth is,<br> according to Punxsutawney Phil,<br> this bitter winter is far from over.<br> Back to you, Mike.<br> What?<br> Yesterday, the Secretary of State<br> held a top-level<br> - State Department security brief...<br> - What's funny?<br> - You put Seabiscuit back in?<br> - But we agree that Hezbollah<br> has shown a willingness<br> to continue to attack.<br> - Becky?<br> - Can I call you back?<br> ...lsraeli incursions.<br> What steps are you taking to limit<br> these Hezbollah retaliations?<br> You have Pomeroy<br> under contract, right?<br> Yeah. He was supposed to do<br> stories for one of our magazine shows.<br> - Yeah?<br> - We couldn't use anything he pitched.<br> - Nothing?<br> - An eight-part story<br> on the United Nations.<br> An interview with a Pashtun warlord.<br> A piece on microfinance in Asia?<br> It's all been so tempting.<br> - Jerry!<br> - So we're just paying him to sit there.<br> Wait. But he must<br> have millions on his contract.<br> You have a world-caliber<br> news man with nothing to do!<br> - Becky, this is...<br> - No, Pomeroy has reported<br> on every major story of the last three<br> decades, with integrity and courage!<br> I mean, he was the only anchor to go<br> down to Ground Zero on the day.<br> His Q ratings, I looked at them,<br> they're unbelievable,<br> - and you're already paying him.<br> - I have to go. We'll discuss this.<br> I...<br> I want to look at his contract!<br> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi.<br> I need your approval<br> to look at his contract.<br> Please.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> I'm Becky Fuller and...<br> We actually met the other day<br> in the elevator.<br> And what the hell are you doing here?<br> I'm the producer of Daybreak and we're<br> actually looking for a new anchor.<br> Then why are you here?<br> Well, it's funny that you should ask.<br> Go away.<br> OK, just hear me out, because the<br> show actually has a lot of potential.<br> We're starting over basically,<br> and with an anchor as esteemed<br> and respected as yourself...<br> You've been a journalist<br> your whole life, ever since<br> your elementary school paper,<br> The Beaverton Bee.<br> I mean, you've got to miss it. You...<br> News breaks, it must just kill you<br> - not to be out there.<br> - Morning shows don't do news.<br> Jesus, Daybreak. Half the people that<br> watch your show have lost their remote.<br> The other half are waiting<br> for their nurse to turn them over.<br> If I wanted to come back,<br> I could have any job I chose.<br> But you can't work on another network<br> for another two years.<br> So I'll continue to enjoy my life<br> on IBS's dime.<br> All right,<br> I didn't want to have to do this.<br> - I looked at your contract.<br> - What?<br> - With the lawyers.<br> - My contract?<br> You're right. They do have to pay you<br> for the last two years of your contract.<br> Unless six months have elapsed<br> without you appearing on the air<br> in any capacity.<br> Then, if the network offers<br> you an official position<br> and you don't take it,<br> they can terminate your contract<br> and the six million dollars<br> that you have left on it.<br> So, here's me with an official offer.<br> Mike Pomeroy, the IBS network<br> would like to offer you<br> the position of co-host of Daybreak.<br> - You're joking.<br> - No.<br> Actually, I'm not.<br> Do you have any idea<br> what's going on in the world?<br> And you want me to do stories<br> about baked Alaska?<br> After the career that I've had?<br> You just need to have an open mind.<br> - Open mind.<br> - I mean, yes, the morning news<br> - has a wider range of stories...<br> - A wider range?!<br> Your program is in the<br> news department, you cretin!<br> News is a sacred temple.<br> And you're part of the cabal<br> that's ruining it with horseshit!<br> That's not actually fair.<br> Because the first half hour of a morning<br> show is a damn fine news broadcast.<br> Sure, we cover news and entertainment.<br> That's everything<br> a newspaper has ever done.<br> There's nothing wrong with that.<br> Think of it this way:<br> We're like a well-informed neighbor,<br> coming over to chat<br> with people in the morning. You know,<br> Brokaw did the morning news.<br> And Charlie Gibson. Walter Cronkite<br> did it at the beginning of his career.<br> I mean, he co-hosted a morning program<br> with a puppet named Charlemagne.<br> Well, then... get a puppet.<br> It's inexpensive and uses things<br> you already have around the house.<br> You can make globes, hats,<br> especially pinatas.<br> Now, mache means<br> "to chew" in French,<br> but we're not actually going<br> to be eating any of this, right?<br> Of course not!<br> No.<br> Coming up next, you've heard her sing.<br> Well, today, you're going<br> to hear about her sweet tooth.<br> Join us as we bake brownies<br> with Celine Dion's personal chef.<br> All that and more,<br> coming up on Daybreak.<br> - We're clear!<br> - Oh, my God,<br> will somebody please get this off?<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - OK, so, we don't have time<br> for the sit-down, so we're just<br> gonna run the package, all right?<br> - Are you OK?<br> - What?<br> Don't beat yourself up.<br> He was never gonna do it. Pomeroy?<br> - How did you know that?<br> - Mike was never gonna come to work<br> at this little dog and pony show,<br> especially not working for somebody<br> - like, well, I'm sorry, but you.<br> - OK. Like, yeah.<br> You. Not in a thousand years. I mean,<br> obviously, don't get me wrong,<br> I would have... I would have<br> welcomed him with open arms.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I heard he was coming in,<br> but I didn't...<br> I've won eight Peabodys.<br> A Pulitzer.<br> Sixteen Emmys.<br> I was shot through<br> the forearm in Bosnia.<br> Pulled Colin Powell from a burning Jeep.<br> I laid a cool washcloth<br> on Mother Teresa's forehead<br> during a cholera epidemic.<br> I've had lunch with Dick Cheney.<br> You're here for the money.<br> That is correct.<br> Five, four, three...<br> Fuck.<br> Welcome back to Daybreak.<br> God, does he cook?<br> Does he do... I don't know,<br> fashion segments and gossip?<br> Does he have three-year-old octuplets<br> barf all over him like I did last year?<br> Well, unfortunately, in the '80s,<br> someone gave him<br> story refusal rights, so no.<br> I don't care. Does he know that<br> this is called morning television?<br> Yes, and I think<br> that after a little bit of time,<br> he's really gonna want<br> to do a mix of stories.<br> Face it! I'm going to end up making<br> turkey meatballs with Mario Batali<br> - for the rest of my natural life.<br> - I need the new titles ASAP.<br> OK, let's move it. Single malt. We've<br> got the hand soap,<br> we got the mixers, the papers,<br> the tropical fruit.<br> Here we go.<br> Whoever heard of mangosteen?<br> - Apparently, he has.<br> - This is Colleen's dressing room<br> and... She's so looking<br> forward to seeing you.<br> Good. Great. Glad to hear it.<br> And this is mine?<br> Yes, but Colleen is... Never mind.<br> You got me the newspapers?<br> The mixers?<br> The tropical fruit plate.<br> All stipulated in your ten-page rider.<br> - Nice of you.<br> - Yes...<br> Colleen wants me, I'll be in here.<br> OK.<br> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br> He should come in here.<br> - OK.<br> - What the hell is that?<br> No hurry.<br> No. No and no.<br> OK.<br> Did you tell her I have papaya in here?<br> He gets a tropical fruit plate?<br> That is just so pathetic.<br> That guy might be our only hope.<br> So I suggest you just man up<br> and get in there!<br> That is such a good speech!<br> Guess what? I'm not going.<br> So, we'll be shooting Mike's<br> promos all week and then<br> we'll finalize the format<br> of the show on Friday.<br> Then we'll rehearse<br> Mike's openings and segues.<br> Excuse me.<br> Who is going to say goodbye?<br> - Pardon?<br> - Well, at the end of the show?<br> It doesn't really matter.<br> I mean, Mike, you don't mind<br> if Colleen says goodbye?<br> Well, who do you think the public<br> would rather hear from last?<br> Someone who's won every broadcast<br> award on the face of the planet<br> or the former Miss Pacoima?<br> It's Arizona!<br> In case you're interested,<br> I was Miss Arizona!<br> Christ!<br> We can't both have our arms folded.<br> And I am the female here, I think.<br> - Colleen on this side.<br> - Of course, I'd be more than happy to.<br> Can you just step away,<br> just for a second? Thanks.<br> We don't want<br> to take up your precious... Hello?!<br> - Is that better?<br> - What's next? Bubble bath?<br> Hey. Hi!<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> Hey, I just came to...<br> to offer my condolences<br> on hiring the third<br> worst person in the world.<br> Thanks.<br> Yes. I...<br> Who are the other two?<br> Kim Jong-il<br> and Angela Lansbury, actually.<br> - She knows what she did.<br> - OK.<br> So, I... I gather that you worked<br> with Mike at the nightly news.<br> Worst year of my life.<br> The entire time we worked together,<br> the only thing he ever called me<br> was Senor Dipshit.<br> It's not funny.<br> - I'm sorry, that's not funny.<br> - No.<br> That's terrible.<br> That is terrible, actually.<br> Yeah, so...<br> So now is an excellent time<br> for you to take up drinking.<br> And... And I came by to say<br> that sometimes after work,<br> a few of us go over<br> to Schiller's on Madison,<br> so, you know,<br> if you're ever around...<br> - Around.<br> - Yeah, available.<br> Oh, OK. Yeah.<br> That... would be nice.<br> Yeah, I... I don't,<br> I don't really go out very much,<br> but if I'm in the neighborhood,<br> - I will definitely stop by and say hi.<br> - Well, like tomorrow.<br> - Around eight.<br> - OK. Yeah, sounds good.<br> - All right.<br> - Sure, yeah.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> That's not too shabby.<br> You got a new anchor.<br> Somebody asked you out on a date.<br> Things are lookin' up.<br> That was... He...<br> Not asking me out on a date.<br> I think it was.<br> I was standin' right there.<br> - No, no.<br> - Yeah.<br> He was just mentioning that<br> he might be somewhere. I mean...<br> Come on, please, I think I would<br> know if I was being asked out on a date.<br> - It's a date.<br> - So, we've got the bird whisperer<br> - confirmed for Tuesday?<br> - Yes.<br> Great. And...<br> Al Green on the plaza Wednesday.<br> - Two songs.<br> - OK.<br> And Colleen, do you want to do<br> the interview between the songs?<br> No, let me.<br> Yeah, I'll do it.<br> OK. Mike, so we have this great story<br> on children's water safety.<br> - That's the...<br> - Not my thing.<br> OK, how about a rundown of the new<br> shows on the fall television season?<br> - Oh, yeah. That's a no.<br> - OK.<br> The boom in organic farming.<br> Very hot topic right now.<br> That's newsy, right?<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Fire another anchor?<br> Then we're gonna be stuck with<br> that guy who counts with his hooves.<br> Colleen can't do every story<br> that's not hard news.<br> It's Mike Pomeroy. He's a legend.<br> What am I supposed to tell him?<br> - There she is.<br> - What? Oh, hi.<br> Interesting, Jerry hired you.<br> No polish. No pedigree.<br> Those bangs.<br> What was he thinking?<br> Just wondering.<br> - He's a peach.<br> - Yeah.<br> Coming soon to Daybreak,<br> one of the most legendary newsmen<br> of all time.<br> Soon, he'll be bringing his<br> experience to morning television.<br> Let Mike Pomeroy show you the world<br> over your first cup of coffee!<br> - Oh, for Christ's sake.<br> - What? What, what, what is it now?<br> It's embarrassing. I mean,<br> what's in the briefcase?<br> - What do you mean? What?<br> - Special anchorman papers?<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> - My lunch? Where am I going?<br> - We've been over this eight times!<br> - I'm running to nowhere.<br> - I look like a jackass!<br> - No... Yes, you do.<br> You know, whoever gave you<br> promo approval was smoking crack!<br> - I want to meet that person.<br> - I was mopping the floor<br> - with Peter Jennings at the time.<br> - I want to have words with...<br> I could have had hookers and<br> eight balls written into my contract.<br> - How nice for you.<br> ...over your first cup of coffee.<br> Why do we have to mention that first<br> cup of coffee? Why not just say,<br> "Watch Mike Pomeroy<br> before your morning dump?"<br> One of the most legendary newsmen...<br> So for the fashion segments, I think<br> it's important that we interpret<br> runway trends for our viewers because<br> they're not all six foot and size zero.<br> - Man, he's cute.<br> - I went to Yale with him.<br> - Shut up.<br> - You did not.<br> Everyone was madly in love with him.<br> Actually, just me and<br> every single person I knew.<br> - Can we just?<br> - His dad was editor of Newsweek.<br> His mom's family is rich as hell.<br> They own like Tupperware or something.<br> He rowed crew for Yale when they won<br> the national championship.<br> Hi.<br> - You know him?<br> - No. Yeah, well, yes, I mean, I...<br> - Yes.<br> - Don't you think he's smokin'?<br> - Smokin'.<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't know, I don't know.<br> Let me see. I don't know.<br> - Not a hard question.<br> - He's walking away.<br> So jeans and belts.<br> You have a rash or something<br> spreading on your neck.<br> Well, you know,<br> I asked him to do a piece on Trump.<br> And he actually picked up my Diet Coke<br> and hurled it across the room.<br> - Wow, he picked it up.<br> - Just missed me. He did.<br> I asked him to cover<br> a bumper crop of cranberries<br> and he slapped me in the face.<br> - He did?<br> - It's true.<br> - Really?<br> - Of course, he was drunk off his ass.<br> Adam!<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi. How are ya?<br> - I'm good.<br> - Hi.<br> - You never called me!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> We... I was...<br> I've been workin' a lot.<br> Well, maybe I'll see you at<br> Barton's regatta party on Saturday.<br> - Great, great.<br> - OK, great.<br> Yeah, cool.<br> - Sorry, I was just...<br> - That's OK.<br> Absolutely fine. That's fine, fine.<br> - Bye.<br> - See you later.<br> - Yeah.<br> - So, anyway,<br> the reason that I came by tonight,<br> was because I don't really know<br> that many people who know Mike,<br> and I thought, that, you know,<br> I could get your professional feedback.<br> - My feedback?<br> - Yeah, you know.<br> I mean, 'cause I'm actually<br> new in town and I don't...<br> - Come on.<br> - No, please.<br> ...have that many work contacts, so...<br> Great. So... we'll be contacts?<br> That would be great.<br> Well, you can never<br> have enough of those.<br> No, you can't.<br> So, definitely be seeing you around.<br> - OK.<br> - OK.<br> Shit.<br> OK. Good rehearsal. Good stuff.<br> So let's just alternate the<br> voiceover intros of the headlines.<br> - OK.<br> - And then ad-lib.<br> So, let's say, for example, we're doing<br> a story about, I don't know,<br> - a midterm election.<br> - But we won't.<br> Because the morning shows<br> don't do news.<br> Pompous. That's really interesting.<br> That's a different color for you.<br> - That's...<br> - OK, and you two should just sort of,<br> you know, banter back and forth<br> a little bit.<br> Banter, from the Latin word,<br> meaning "to gibber like a moron?"<br> Just, you know,<br> talk about the headlines.<br> That's... that's what I mean.<br> I'm not gonna sit here and rehearse<br> like I'm in summer stock.<br> I've been on the air for 40 years,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> I think I know how to ad-lib.<br> The spill began<br> when the tanker was damaged<br> in heavy seas outside Galveston.<br> Knock, knock.<br> Can I come in?<br> I just wanted to say,<br> you know, good luck.<br> Colleen's Pap smear.<br> A television classic.<br> Are you drunk?<br> Insufficiently.<br> Current weather conditions<br> are complicating efforts<br> ...to contain the...<br> - That's my chair.<br> What?<br> That's where I belong. There.<br> ...authorities have asked<br> the federal government...<br> Took it away from me,<br> those motherfu...<br> I think maybe you should just go home...<br> - See this?<br> - Yes. What is that?<br> Forty-year-old Bruichladdich.<br> I only drink this<br> when I'm practically suicidal.<br> OK.<br> You're, you're very funny.<br> Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow...<br> right?<br> ...is almost impossible to calculate.<br> Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi. I...<br> Sorry. I thought that I might<br> swing by to...<br> ...see if...<br> What are you working on?<br> We're working on a piece<br> on the communist rebels<br> in the Philippines.<br> Good. That sounds great. So I went to<br> the bar the other night to see you.<br> Yeah, I could tell. By the way<br> you ran in the other direction.<br> Your arms, pinwheeling.<br> Yeah. OK, fair, true.<br> I think that you're sort of...<br> ...comically great.<br> And I thought it seemed<br> so promising so I bungled it,<br> because that's what I do.<br> I bungle things.<br> I bungle and I ramble, and that's<br> kind of like what I'm doing right now,<br> talking about it.<br> You threw me off guard.<br> You, with your...<br> And the... and the, this...<br> And the...<br> My working on a loom?<br> - My, my...<br> - No.<br> ...double-handed craps. My...<br> - I...<br> - My Jazzercise.<br> - Rowing. Rowing.<br> - Rowing?<br> - Championship?<br> I never would have got that.<br> But you know what I mean.<br> That I didn't think that you...<br> liked me.<br> But I do. Oddly.<br> You're... different.<br> And a deeply terrible mime.<br> Well, I asked you out.<br> Then when I saw you at the bar,<br> I practically tackled you to the ground.<br> What part of that was confusing?<br> Here, here, here, sit down.<br> Look, my radar for that kind of thing<br> is so bad.<br> I mean, I don't know if a man's<br> interested in me until he's naked.<br> I mean, the pants come off<br> and then I'm like,<br> "I guess you don't really want<br> to see my CD collection<br> - or talk about Kerouac."<br> - You're nuts.<br> OK, look.<br> Let's start over.<br> Let's go out to dinner<br> like... regular people.<br> Just take it slowly,<br> just see where it leads.<br> - How does that sound?<br> - That sounds perfect.<br> Oh, God, I should go home.<br> It's eight! It's eight already.<br> - I know.<br> - It's Mike's first day tomorrow.<br> - You should definitely go.<br> - What's the big whoop?<br> I mean, you know, he's done this<br> like a million times before.<br> - Yeah.<br> - And he knows exactly what he's doing.<br> - Yeah.<br> - So...<br> It's fine.<br> He didn't open a bottle of<br> How do you know that?<br> What?<br> When I was working with him,<br> if there was something that<br> he didn't want to do, the Oscars,<br> the Olympics, something that people<br> might actually get a tiny twinge<br> of pleasure from, the night before,<br> he would go on a bender.<br> Call in sick for work the next day.<br> No. No, no. This is ridiculous.<br> I'm not...<br> I'm not going out there<br> and chasing him around.<br> If he wants to screw this up,<br> that is his problem.<br> - Start at Elaine's.<br> - Oh, God, thank you.

How come?<br> I mean, do you have any kind of plan?<br> Yes, the show will still...<br> need some fine-tuning...<br> Fine-tuning? Really?<br> Can you tune something<br> when nothing is working?<br> Mike Pomeroy is the key<br> to making this show work.<br> Well, at the moment, he's ruining<br> your show, and to be honest,<br> you haven't got much time<br> for fine-tuning, right?<br> - Yeah. I'm not worried.<br> - You're... Really?<br> I'm not worried.<br> How about profiles?<br> We're doing a piece on Daniel Boulud.<br> Does it end with me in<br> the kitchen making profiterole?<br> No.<br> Cornish hens.<br> OK, forget that.<br> How about an interview<br> with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill?<br> Either one of them becomes president<br> or cures cancer, let me know.<br> But I do have one good lead.<br> Yeah? Yeah, really?<br> - I hear you're dating Senor Dipshit.<br> - What?<br> - How did you make that happen?<br> - Who told you that?<br> - Him and you, really?<br> - No, I'm...<br> Because usually, you know, he dates<br> girls that are sort of, you know with...<br> Taffy pullers with...<br> heavy meatballs?<br> There's a developing story<br> coming out of Albany, though.<br> The governor's<br> tax returns are being audited.<br> Oh, for God's sakes,<br> you're killing me, no!<br> - I want people to get to know you.<br> - No, you don't.<br> You want me to pander so you can<br> sell erectile dysfunction medication.<br> - Oh, no, I don't.<br> - Well, I won't!<br> Oh, my God!<br> It's you, you're that guy!<br> I just saw you this morning and<br> everyone was eating stuffed zucchini,<br> and you were cranky about it. I was<br> like, "Oh, my God, there's that guy!"<br> You used to do news, right?<br> Like a while ago? It's...<br> Please, remove your hand<br> from my person. Thank you.<br> This is great! Thank you!<br> I can't believe it! Dan Rather!<br> - Dan Rather!<br> - See? People want to like you.<br> You're...<br> you're in their home every day,<br> and, you know,<br> it's an honor and, you know,<br> why can't you just do stories<br> people might enjoy? Mike...<br> We're in trouble. I'm in trouble.<br> Help me, please.<br> Dan Rather. For Christ's sake.<br> Becky! Becky!<br> Becky.<br> I have a great idea for a segment.<br> Get ready for this.<br> Past lives.<br> If we could find out who celebrities<br> had been in their past lives, I think<br> that would be terrific, don't you?<br> I mean, what if Justin Timberlake<br> had been Abraham Lincoln?<br> Many actors have changed their names<br> to be taken more seriously.<br> Ricky Schroder became Rick.<br> The Rock became Dwayne Johnson.<br> And Portia de Rossi's<br> name used to be Amanda,<br> but she changed it so as to<br> sound more like the car,<br> which she felt sounded<br> more impressorial.<br> A new name has become the latest,<br> hottest accessory for celebrities,<br> like a Birkin bag or a baby.<br> Back to you, Mike or Michael.<br> - Dissolve to Mike and ticker in.<br> - How did she get here?<br> - Don't ask.<br> - What? Is she sleeping with someone?<br> Pardon me?<br> Thanks.<br> - Have you seen these?<br> - Yes, but...<br> You want to make the ratings worse?<br> That's why you came here?<br> Well, no.<br> Mike is still getting up to speed.<br> - I'm working on a couple elements.<br> - Gettin' Mike up to speed?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You're circling the drain.<br> You rarely book anybody decent<br> because of the ratings.<br> - You're not gettin' any big interviews.<br> - We just need more time.<br> - Just a little...<br> - God, you're, you're more naive<br> - than I thought, aren't ya?<br> - Excuse me?<br> The network wants to cancel the show.<br> They want to run game shows<br> and syndicated talk instead.<br> For a second,<br> I thought you might have a shot,<br> especially when you got Pomeroy.<br> But the joke's on me,<br> 'cause it turns out you failed even more<br> completely than the network thought.<br> In six weeks, they cancel the show.<br> Not only will you have significantly<br> weakened our news division,<br> you will have presided over the<br> demise of a show that's been on the air<br> for 47 years! Nice work.<br> Why don't you go over to PBS and see<br> if you can kill Sesame Street.<br> Go. You've wasted enough of my time.<br> We have six weeks.<br> Can you just not tell anyone yet?<br> Because morale isn't exactly at a peak.<br> Fine. Tell 'em when you want to.<br> It doesn't really matter, does it?<br> Piper, get Phil Griffin on the phone.<br> Tell him if I don't hear<br> from him by 5:00,<br> those Super Bowl tickets<br> go to Phyllis McGrady!<br> ...joins us<br> now with details. Roger.<br> It certainly is a happy day<br> here on Lincoln Road<br> between Bedford Avenue<br> and Rogers Avenue.<br> This is, yes, officials...<br> - We're live at five, people.<br> - OK.<br> Feathery, fleecy, flocculent?<br> - Oh, for Christ's sake.<br> - What? What's going on now?<br> Mike is offended by a word<br> in the next story.<br> He's offended.<br> It's about Easter chicks.<br> I'm not saying the word "fluffy."<br> It's bad enough I have to do<br> these ridiculous stories.<br> You know what, buddy?<br> Guess what? Last week,<br> I had to use the words "rectal"<br> and "moisture" in the same sentence.<br> - Well, first dates can be awkward.<br> - Mike!<br> - Becky...<br> - That's it!<br> - Becky, Becky, what are you doin'?<br> - I've had enough!<br> - Mike? I need to talk to you.<br> - Becky, we're back in 60.<br> I'm sorry, this'll just take a second.<br> I've looked up to you all my life.<br> You know that? I actually idolized you.<br> My dad and I used to watch you on TV.<br> So just, you know, imagine<br> my surprise when it turns out<br> that you're actually the worst person<br> in the entire world.<br> - Not the third worst! The worst!<br> - What's goin' on?<br> Pomeroy.<br> He broke the latest Daybreak EP.<br> ...how lucky we all are<br> to have these jobs,<br> - how quickly that can be taken away.<br> - We're back in...<br> And there's this guy, this really<br> kind of great, smokin' guy<br> who can actually stand me<br> long enough to have sex with me.<br> And you know what? It's all just<br> a big mess. Because of you!<br> You know, nobody can do<br> their jobs well around here<br> because you can't be bothered<br> to do yours at all!<br> And we're back.<br> Welcome back to Daybreak. And now,<br> with a check of the weather,<br> - here's Ernie.<br> - Take Ernie on the plaza.<br> Thanks, Colleen. Surprisingly toasty day<br> out here, isn't it, folks?<br> Yeah!<br> Good day to break out the bikini.<br> I know I'm wearing mine right now.<br> All right. Well, what do we have here?<br> Goodness, honey.<br> I did not put her up to this.<br> - Coke? Diet Coke?<br> - No, I don't want a Diet Coke.<br> Step aside!<br> - Jerry, I would like to talk to you.<br> - You're gonna bust a cap in my ass?<br> What if I get the ratings up?<br> We've got six weeks.<br> What if I move that needle just enough?<br> - You won't.<br> - We'II, you're... you don't know that.<br> - Becky.<br> - There's got to be some number<br> I can hit that will give us a shot, that<br> would give us an extra six months,<br> - something.<br> - Sure, if you got over one point five<br> - or something absurd like that...<br> - Done! So I've got your word?<br> I get those ratings up more<br> than three quarters of a point,<br> - you give me more time?<br> - It won't happen.<br> We'll see about that.<br> And your girlfriend Lisa?<br> Can you get her a dictionary<br> and stick her on somebody else's show?<br> 'Cause she's killing me.<br> Wow, well, look who the wind blew in!<br> What happened to you?<br> Well, we're gonna change a few things.<br> - OK.<br> - Is Ernie in place?<br> Yes, he is. He'll be interviewing people<br> as they come off the coaster.<br> No, he won't. Not anymore, he's not.<br> We're gonna put him on that coaster.<br> We're gonna strap a handheld to the car<br> in front of him and then go live. Boom.<br> It's called "picking up the game,"<br> people. OK? So from now on,<br> every single story that we do,<br> it's gonna have to be sensational!<br> We're gonna be more aggressive.<br> We're gonna work harder.<br> And we're gonna do it right now.<br> - Are, are you gonna?<br> - I'm not gonna sing!<br> Why do people ask me that?<br> So the big question is,<br> are we gonna be able to hear his mic?<br> Yes, we will.<br> If he has a heart attack,<br> we'll be able to capture<br> every heartrending scream.<br> - Really? Great.<br> - Cue her.<br> Thrill-seekers have something to look<br> forward to this summer<br> as Six Flags unveils<br> a brand-new roller coaster.<br> The "Manhandler" is<br> the fastest coaster in the U.S.<br> - With speeds up to 130 miles an hour...<br> - Stand Ernie by. Here we go.<br> ...ninety-five degrees. Our own<br> Ernie Appleby is getting a sneak peek<br> at this amazing new ride,<br> isn't that right, Ernie?<br> - Standing by. Open his mic.<br> - Ernie, can you hear us?<br> Yes. Yes, I can. And so far,<br> it's a beautiful ride.<br> Quite an amazing view from up here.<br> Mostly blue skies.<br> Cumulus clouds on the horizon,<br> always a good sign this time of year.<br> Might be heading into our first dip.<br> Oh, my. Oh, my.<br> Oh, fu...<br> No!<br> Oh, yeah. No, this is a great idea.<br> - Please, make it stop!<br> - Take two.<br> What are you gonna do to him next?<br> Strap electrodes to his balls?<br> I actually felt sorry for that<br> animatronic puppet asshole.<br> Hey, look, we got 80,000 hits<br> on YouTube already.<br> And Ernie is absolutely thrilled.<br> And by the way,<br> we had another bump<br> in the minute-to-minutes.<br> - Becky, good stuff.<br> - Thank you! Lighten up, Mike.<br> You know what I've noticed?<br> People only say, "Lighten up"<br> when they're gonna stick<br> their fist up your ass.<br> Well, you know what?<br> I hate to break it to you,<br> - but the fact is...<br> - Oh, my God, amazing segment.<br> Thank you. The world has been debating<br> news versus entertainment for years<br> and guess what?<br> Mike, your side lost.<br> - You know what?<br> - What?<br> You're wrong. People are smart.<br> They want information. Not junk, which<br> is all you're willing to give them.<br> - Junk. Sugar, sugar, sugar.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - OK.<br> - And more sugar.<br> Yeah, well, what would you<br> have them do, Mike?<br> Eat bran all day?<br> Fiber, fiber, fiber?<br> We have to get the ratings up, Mike,<br> or we can have a lot of high-minded<br> ideas and not be on the air.<br> This show may go down, but it's not<br> because I'm not trying my hardest.<br> You hear me? I don't care what you do,<br> but I'm not giving up.<br> I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk<br> to you right now about Ernie.<br> I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk<br> to you right now about Ernie.<br> - Oh, my God, you, too?<br> - Yes.<br> Why is everyone worried about Ernie?<br> You know, he's a grown man.<br> - Worried about Ernie? You kidding me?<br> - He signed release forms.<br> He's a hack.<br> Look, I see what you're doing.<br> I think it's great. It's exactly<br> what I've been waiting for,<br> so just, you know, sign me up, coach.<br> Put me in.<br> - Whatever you want to call it.<br> - Really?<br> Yeah.<br> Do you have any preexisting conditions?<br> Are you kidding?

I mean, we need this.<br> We're, we're, we're almost there.<br> Coming up in our next hour, we'll be<br> talking to people who successfully<br> completed this innovative<br> rehab program.<br> Might want to pick up<br> a few tips there, Mike.<br> Do they have rehab programs for bitter<br> beauty queens with self-esteem issues?<br> I wonder about that sometimes.<br> Sometimes. Well, coming up next...<br> But they are way better.<br> They're way up from last year.<br> I'm, I'm almost there.<br> So many people rely on this show.<br> They believe in it.<br> You have until Friday.<br> That's the deal we made.<br> And those are still not good enough.<br> ...so no real flooding to speak of in<br> the neighborhoods. But the concern is,<br> they are prepared...<br> ...to help folks if necessary, Kitty.<br> - What?<br> Well, the center of<br> lowa's second biggest city,<br> Cedar Rapids, is already underwater.<br> Sorry.<br> I mean, our demos are getting better.<br> But our overall numbers, they're<br> just not where they should be.<br> We're just missing... something.<br> Well, maybe it's time for another<br> eight-part series on the orgasm.<br> Do you think so? I mean,<br> I don't know what else we<br> would possibly talk about.<br> - You're making fun of me.<br> - No.<br> Never mind.<br> Just... doesn't matter.<br> I'll just deal with it in the morning.<br> You look at me like there's something<br> wrong with me all the time.<br> - And I can't, I can't do it.<br> - What?<br> That is the most ridiculous<br> statement you have ever made.<br> I can't let my guard down<br> for one second, you know.<br> I don't look at my BlackBerry and I miss<br> getting the next big story.<br> And I'm tired of feeling guilty<br> about my work. I can't.<br> Becky, wait a second.<br> Yeah. OK. Look, that<br> information's a matter of public record.<br> I have a right to see it.<br> You know that.<br> You want me to come on down there<br> and I'll bring a crew?<br> Better yet, a subpoena.<br> OK, and I think we<br> should end the segment<br> with Ernie being tarred and feathered<br> in honor of the anniversary<br> of the Boston Tea Party.<br> Or I could do my good story<br> on weathervanes.<br> No!<br> OK, so great job, everyone.<br> Excuse me, excuse me.<br> Just one, one moment, please.<br> I have a story I'd like to do.<br> Sauerkraut.<br> Sauerkraut?<br> Big annual Sauerkraut Festival upstate.<br> They bowl with cabbage,<br> make a big sauerkraut cake.<br> They... have a competition<br> for the best sauerkraut.<br> You want to do that?<br> What? Do you have<br> a problem with that?<br> No.<br> It's OK? I'm doing the kraut? Right?<br> - If you, if you want to.<br> - Good. Good.<br> Hi!<br> - Hi!<br> - Don't really have to go, you know.<br> I want to. My goodness.<br> I wouldn't miss this for...<br> - Get in.<br> - All right.<br> Say hello to Joe.<br> - Joe, Becky. Becky, Joe. Go.<br> - Hi, Joe.<br> Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br> This isn't the way. No, no.<br> - Mike, where are we going?<br> - To cover the news.<br> - What?<br> - At 8am this morning,<br> - I'm going to cover a story.<br> - Mike.<br> - A real story.<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> - Where are you?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What do you mean, you don't know?<br> - Well, he won't tell me.<br> He's kidnapped me.<br> He's gone around some kind of bend<br> and I need you to get Colleen ready<br> with a backup story, please!<br> - What backup story?<br> - Let Ernie do the weathervane thing.<br> - No, no, no, no. Jesus.<br> - I need something<br> when Mike's story tanks.<br> You know, you're a terrible person!<br> You baited me with sauerkraut.<br> That's so low.<br> I mean, what the hell<br> is this story, Mike?!<br> - The governor.<br> - What governor?<br> We're not even<br> anywhere near Albany.<br> No, we're not.<br> It's up here a little further, Joe.<br> - A little further.<br> - Oh, my God,<br> this is the governor's country house.<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> You're experiencing a psychotic break.<br> Are you insane?<br> Well, I won't be dragged down with you.<br> You're gonna get us arrested and fired.<br> I get fired, I never work again,<br> you lunatic.<br> I'm not gonna run it, Mike.<br> I won't, you can't make me.<br> I'll run Colleen getting her bikini<br> line waxed before I run it. Mike!<br> They're gonna cancel the show!<br> If we don't get our numbers up<br> by the end of this week, we're toast.<br> We're gonna be replaced<br> by soap operas and... game shows.<br> Come on, Joe.<br> - Lenny, are you ready?<br> - Ready?<br> - Ready? Ready for what?<br> - Jesus.<br> - Check, check.<br> - Hey.<br> You'll know when to go live.<br> Get out of my shot.<br> Go live with what?<br> Pomeroy!<br> - Gary, how are ya?<br> - What the hell are you doin'here?<br> I need the weathervanes, Lenny.<br> - I need 'em, need...<br> - So we're goin' with weathervanes.<br> - Yes.<br> - Specifically,<br> we'd like to know how you feel about<br> the Attorney General's filing<br> racketeering charges<br> against you this morning.<br> - Charges of corruption...<br> - No, wait, wait.<br> ...and steering government contracts.<br> - Wait, wait, wait.<br> - We cannot wait!<br> - Hold your horses.<br> And there's a hooker or two...<br> in there as well, isn't there, sir?<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Becky!<br> - What is going on here?<br> - Comin' through!<br> Mike, I don't know where you get<br> your information. You know I like you.<br> - Stand by to go live.<br> - What?<br> ...but if you don't leave,<br> I'm gonna have to call the police.<br> - Wait one second.<br> - I don't think that's gonna<br> be necessary, sir.<br> Becky!<br> Live! Live!<br> Live to Becky, now!<br> - Up on rem two!<br> - Now taking you live<br> to Mike Pomeroy for a special report.<br> Federal authorities have been<br> planning this raid for weeks.<br> This reporter has learned that<br> the indictment contains 15 counts<br> of racketeering<br> and using undue influence.<br> My sources tell me authorities<br> have tapped phone calls,<br> and incriminating e-mails.<br> Mike Pomeroy, Daybreak.<br> Back to you in the studio.<br> - Take two.<br> - Thanks, Mike.<br> Partly cloudy skies this afternoon<br> with slight chance...<br> You know, you could have told me.<br> I might have covered it anyway.<br> Liar.<br> Look, I get it.<br> Nobody really cares that<br> I can do this job, but...<br> But I can.<br> I wanted you to see that.<br> That was a great story, Mike.<br> That was...<br> that was better than a great story,<br> that was great television.<br> I mean, that was bran with a doughnut.<br> A bran doughnut.<br> I've got a grandkid.<br> Did you know that?<br> Alexander.<br> I haven't seen him since I got fired.<br> I was embarrassed...<br> after all I'd accomplished.<br> And then to...<br> ...come back to the news... this way.<br> The truth is, I'd...<br> I'd screwed up with my kids<br> way before I got canned.<br> Anyway, I was never at home and...<br> ...when I was,<br> I took every phone call,<br> watching TV out of the corner of my eye.<br> Why am I telling you this?<br> You're worse than I am.<br> You'd sleep at the office if you could.<br> Let me tell you how it turns out.<br> You end up with... with nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> Which is... which is what I had...<br> ...till you came along.<br> Wait a second.<br> Did you just say something nice to me?<br> I told you I could banter.<br> Felt like getting a jump on it.<br> They're not... awful.<br> How much longer can we get?<br> Well, I have to check<br> with upstairs, but...<br> with these I can get you a year,<br> a comfortable year.<br> I underestimated you, Becky.<br> That's... that's very, very true.<br> NBC called.<br> NBC?<br> Wanted to know how much time<br> you have on your contract.<br> The Today show wants you.<br> Well, that's very flattering. I...<br> Is that what you want?<br> They were gonna cancel the show.<br> - OK.<br> - Yeah.<br> And somehow, we saved it.<br> And, you know, the thing is...<br> is that the second I knew<br> that everything was gonna be OK, the<br> person that I wanted to tell was you.<br> The Today show? That's huge.<br> Yeah, yeah,<br> it's, it's, it's incredible.<br> But I, I have to think about it. I...<br> - What?<br> - Well, yeah, I mean, I...<br> Well, the thing is, is that at Daybreak,<br> everyone's really starting to click.<br> Everybody's pitching in<br> and doing what they're best at.<br> - No story too high or low.<br> - No, hold on,<br> you can't say no to this.<br> When you get an opportunity like this,<br> - you have to grab it.<br> - Even Mike is almost happy.<br> And that's a good enough reason to<br> give up the best job in broadcasting?<br> We're...<br> Daybreak is a family now.<br> Becky, I've known Mike a long time.<br> I... It doesn't matter how happy he is.<br> He's not just gonna suddenly<br> change into a different person.<br> Well, I think you're wrong.<br> I know what I'm doing with him now.<br> I do. I do.<br> It's gonna be great.<br> So we've got the Supreme Court<br> Justice hearings at the top of the hour<br> and then... I forgot<br> to tell you, Anthony Bourdain<br> - wants to do a segment with you!<br> - Bourdain? Love him. Not doin' that.<br> But say hi to Tony.<br> I owe him a bottle of Patron.<br> - What?<br> - What? We do one good story together<br> and suddenly I'm your bitch?<br> Don't think so. Sorry.<br> Wait. Wait, wait, wait.<br> You can't do one story for me?<br> Oh, my God, what is wrong with me?<br> What am I doing here,<br> beating my head against this wall?<br> I might as well go to the Today<br> show where you don't have to poke<br> - Matt Lauer with a stick...<br> - The Today show?<br> - Yes, they offered me a job.<br> - Of course.<br> - But you know what? I said...<br> - Time to move on.<br> You'll love the Today show.<br> You and Vieira can do<br> menopause stories every week!<br> You know what's really ridiculous?<br> Is that until about ten seconds ago,<br> I'd actually considered turning my back<br> on the best job I've ever been offered.<br> Isn't that totally absurd?<br> What's keeping you?<br> OK.<br> You know, if you'd ever treated me<br> with some kind of friendship or loyalty,<br> or trust, these things<br> that you seem incapable of...<br> You miserable, Ionely, egotistical,<br> selfish asshole!<br> - Hey, Becky.<br> - Hi.<br> They called again. Today show.<br> Thanks.<br> Becky Fuller.<br> Obviously, we have a long<br> track record of success here<br> at the Today show, but we're<br> always looking to stay current,<br> to get out of our comfort zone,<br> and we want the show<br> to have that youthful energy.<br> And we are so impressed<br> with what you have done<br> with Daybreak.<br> Well, thank you very much.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Everyone is talking about it.<br> You must know that.<br> I mean, you have done an amazing job<br> of revitalizing a show<br> that many people<br> had just completely written off.<br> Well, thank you. Thanks.<br> And we're out!<br> You did this.<br> They're gonna hire her.<br> Yeah. She's at the Today show<br> right now, ding dong.<br> Do you have any idea, you know,<br> what you've done here?<br> Because we had a decent producer,<br> a decent show and,<br> God forbid, anyone around here<br> should be happy,<br> but you had to have this happen,<br> didn't you?<br> All right, stand by, folks. Here we go.<br> Three, two, one.<br> And dissolve two.<br> And cue 'em! Cue 'em!<br> - Welcome back to Daybreak.<br> - What is wrong?<br> ...at the nation's<br> crumbling infrastructure.<br> Go to Colleen.<br> Jesus, jump off Mike.<br> - Where the hell is he going?<br> - Take three, three.<br> Cue over to three. Swing her to three,<br> please. Come on, Jane, over to three.<br> Sorry, the... this segment's<br> usually a two shot<br> of Mike and Colleen<br> and Mike's not there.<br> They've probably just<br> changed something. Sorry.<br> I don't know. Where is Mike?<br> - I need eggs.<br> - You need what?<br> You know, from chickens. Eggs!<br> Really don't enjoy this job.<br> Chinese people, move, move, move!<br> Thank you!<br> Celery. Peppers. Cheese. Cheese.<br> Yeah, thank you very much.<br> We wanted to know what your plans<br> are for sports coverage.<br> Sports. Great, OK.<br> Great.<br> I love sports.<br> Come on, move, move!<br> Let's go, let's go!<br> - Get it in there, slide it in!<br> - Mike, tell us what you need.<br> I need a cutting board, good knife,<br> nice plate, bowl, whisk.<br> What is this, rubber?<br> Get me a real bowl.<br> - Where are my eggs?!<br> - Cue over to three.<br> - Where are my goddamn eggs?!<br> - Eggs for Mike, please!<br> In respect to sports, I think that it's<br> really important to reach out<br> to women through their kids<br> because it's not that big of a step<br> to go from being a soccer mom<br> to, you know, a...<br> Oh, my God. What is he doing?<br> Sorry, I just...<br> This is... Mike Pomeroy is having<br> a nervous breakdown on air.<br> That's kind of big news.<br> ...a meal for their afternoon repast,<br> something they could make<br> using whatever ingredients<br> - they had available.<br> - Holy shit.<br> I've been making frittata<br> for about 20 years now,<br> ever since I was taught how to,<br> on a naked weekend<br> with a beautiful Italian movie star,<br> who shall, of course,<br> remain nameless.<br> Occasionally, I make them at home.<br> But only for people that I...<br> People I really care about.<br> Now the key to a great frittata<br> is a very hot pan,<br> because that, my friends,<br> is what makes it... fluffy.<br> We'll let this firm up a little bit.<br> - Dash of pepper.<br> - I'm sorry. I...<br> You watchin' this?<br> - Becky?<br> - Yes, I... yeah.<br> He is not gonna ask you twice.<br> We'll give it a few seconds,<br> then we'll pop it in the hot oven.<br> Bye! Thanks!<br> A little pepper.<br> Stand by. He's goin' back to the oven.<br> Ready three.<br> A lot of people like a glass of di Gavi.<br> Gavi di Gavi, perhaps.<br> I, myself, like a... Barolo.<br> I'll just free up the edges.<br> Next week on the show,<br> I'll show you how to make<br> a fantastic beignet,<br> which the rabble like to call...<br> ...doughnuts.<br> The old bastard.<br> You know, he's still the<br> third worst person in the world.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> That's good.<br> That's really good.<br> I want a tropical fruit plate.<br> "His gravity leavens<br> the silliness of morning TV,<br> making for an incongruous<br> but somehow perfect match.<br> Turns out that after 40 years<br> in the business,<br> the real Mike Pomeroy<br> has finally arrived."<br> Not bad.<br> By the way, I'm getting<br> my prostate checked next week.<br> I thought I'd take a crew with me.<br> - That's a great idea. We...<br> - Jesus, I'm kidding.<br> No, seriously, they have these<br> little teeny, tiny cameras<br> - that go right up your...<br> - No, no, no.<br> What if we got you<br> a body double?<br> - No!<br> - No?<br> Not in a thousand years.<br>
