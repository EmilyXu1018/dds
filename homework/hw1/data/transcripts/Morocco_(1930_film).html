Yet.<br> [ Officer Shouts Command<br> Get in there!<br> All packed up, sir.<br> Ready to land.<br> Thank you,John.<br> There you are.<br> I hope I haven't forgotten<br> anything. Merci, monsieur.<br> You are very kind.<br> Your first voyage<br> to Morocco?<br> Yes. I make the trip quite often.<br> Perhaps I can be<br> of some service.<br> ['d be happy to help you.<br> I won't need any help.<br> You can always reach me<br> at this address, mademoiselle.<br> Merci, monsieur.<br> Good evening, Officer.<br> Good evening.<br> Do you know who<br> that woman is?<br> A vaudeville actress,<br> probably.<br> Uh,just, uh,<br> how do you know that?<br> Oh, we carry them<br> every day.<br> We call them<br> suicide passengers.<br> One-way tickets.<br> They never return.<br> Well, the wanderer returns.<br> How are you?<br> When did you get back?<br> Last night.<br> Alexander, I want you to meet<br> an old friend...<br> Monsieur La Bessiere,<br> citizen of the worid.<br> Very happy.<br> Citizen of the worid.<br> You're a Frenchman, aren't you? Yes.<br> Uh, Miss Martin. Aren't<br> you the painter La Bessiere?<br> I paint... when I find the time.<br> He has all the time he needs.<br> He would be a great painter<br> if he were not so rich.<br> Colonel Beauchard.<br> Colonel.<br> Charmed.<br> Won't you join us?<br> Please.<br> I'd love to, but, uh...<br> isn't that Caesar<br> and his wife?<br> Yes.<br> See you later.<br> Awfully nice to see you<br> in Morocco again.<br> I'm happy to be here, even<br> in this heat. Yes, it is hot.<br> And you, Madame Caesar.<br> How have you been?<br> I've been lonely.<br> We've missed you.<br> I feel greatly...<br> flattered.<br> Your rich friend<br> is very democratic.<br> He can afford to be. He's<br> always chosen his own friends.<br> Adjutant Caesar was a captain<br> in the German Air Service...<br> before joining the legion. Perhaps you<br> can give me the history of his wife.<br> The less said about that<br> the better.<br> The house is packed.<br> The house is packed.<br> This is a great<br> night for you.<br> If you make a hit, you can<br> stay here as long as you like.<br> Now, you may have heard<br> of me in Europe or not.<br> My house is patronized...<br> by the finest society<br> in Morocco.<br> Now, what was I<br> going to say?<br> Oh, yes. Pick yourself<br> a protector.<br> It will give you<br> prestige.<br> An officer<br> in the legion.<br> They will tell you that officers<br> in the legion are unimportant,<br> that the common legionnaire<br> is the thing.<br> They will tell you that<br> private so-and-so...<br> is a Russian prince<br> or an ex-general,<br> that he joined the legion<br> to forget his past.<br> Don't believe it. The<br> private in the legion...<br> is nobody<br> at 75 centimes per day.<br> Thank you. Pick the<br> officers. They have the money.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> It is no small task,<br> as you know,<br> to supply my establishment<br> with new talent.<br> For some reason, the artists<br> I engage don't last very long.<br> It may be the heat.<br> I do my best.<br> I pay the highest wages<br> in Africa.<br> Mille grazie, senors and<br> senoras. Mille grazie.<br> Anyway, I open<br> the program tonight...<br> with Mademoiselle AmyJolly,<br> a newcomer,<br> whom I hope<br> you will receive...<br> with your usual<br> discriminating kindness.<br> If I remember correctly,<br> Adjutant,<br> this audience shows ''its usual<br> discriminating kindness''...<br> by receiving its newcomers<br> rather unpleasantly.<br> What's the matter?<br> You're late.<br> All right.<br> Sit down. Go ahead.<br> Aah!<br> May I offer you this glass<br> of champagne, mademoiselle?<br> Thank you.<br> votre sant!<br> May I have this?<br> Of course.<br> Sing your number once,<br> then sell the apples.<br> That's important.<br> Sell the apples.<br> You'll make a fortune.<br> Yeah.<br> Over my dead body.<br> Well, what's keepin' ya, baby? Ahh.<br> What am I bid<br> for my apple<br> The fruit that made<br> Adam so wise<br> On the historic night<br> when he took a bite<br> They discovered<br> a new paradise<br> An apple they say<br> keeps the doctor away<br> While his pretty<br> young wife<br> Has the time<br> of her life<br> With the butcher, the baker,<br> the candlestick maker<br> Oh, what am I bid<br> for my apple<br> We meet once more,<br> monsieur.<br> I didn't anticipate<br> this pleasure so soon.<br> Can I also have an apple?<br> But I have no change for that.<br> I hardly expected you'd have.<br> You are, again,<br> very kind.<br> Mademoiselle, may I have the honor<br> of your company after the performance?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I have disposed...<br> of the balance of the evening.<br> Some other time, perhaps?<br> Of course.<br> An apple, sir?<br> Madame?<br> Don't waste your time<br> down there.<br> There's no money<br> in the pit.<br> Isn't there?<br> Thanks for the flower,<br> mademoiselle.<br> Can I offer you<br> an apple too?<br> Lend me 20 francs,<br> Barney.<br> Dat makes 60.<br> Two weeks' pay is a lot<br> of money for an apple.<br> You can have it for nothing,<br> if you like.<br> Nothing doing. I always<br> pay for what I get.<br> I'd sit down<br> if I were you.<br> You are pretty brave.<br> With women.<br> What's the matter, don't<br> you like brave men? Perhaps.<br> Your change...<br> soldier.<br> Tom!<br> Hello! Well, if it isn't Madame Caesar.<br> Tom, I must<br> see you tonight.<br> See me tonight? What if your<br> husband sees you tonight?<br> He isn't going to see me.<br> Isn't he?<br> What if he does?<br> Caesar's wife<br> is above suspicin.<br> Yeah? You may know something<br> about ancient history,<br> but I know something<br> about husbands. Tom.<br> Oh. It's you.<br> What's the matter? Were<br> you expecting someone else?<br> Can I offer you<br> something? Cognac?<br> Too hot.<br> You got any gin?<br> Yes.<br> Cigarette?<br> Thanks.<br> You've made this place<br> look pretty nice.<br> It looks different now.<br> How do you know?<br> Have you...<br> been here before?<br> Well, I've been stationed<br> in this town for a long time.<br> Aren't you drinking?<br> No.<br> Well, salut.<br> You can smell<br> the desert tonight.<br> Hot, isn't it?<br> Faded.<br> You can go now, soldier.<br> You won't have any trouble<br> getting rid of me.<br> Nothing like independence,<br> is there?<br> Well, maybe I am<br> independent... with women.<br> You evidently don't think<br> much of women.<br> I tell you, lady,<br> it's their fault, not mine.<br> Been in the legion<br> very long?<br> Almost three years.<br> Three years?<br> Seems like 300.<br> You sound tired of life.<br> I don't know whether<br> I am or not.<br> I was when I joined<br> this outfit.<br> How about you, mademoiselle?<br> Been on the stage very long?<br> Long enough.<br> Tired of it?<br> No.<br> You've got a lot of pictures<br> with that man. Your husband?<br> Husband? I never found<br> a man good enough for that.<br> That's just the way<br> I feel about women.<br> How long ago<br> was that picture taken?<br> Why?<br> That looks like<br> Russian sable.<br> That coat's worth a load of shekels.<br> You still got it? Don't be absurd.<br> If I still had that coat,<br> I wouldn't be here.<br> What in the name<br> of 10,000 corporals...<br> did you come to a country<br> like this for, anyway?<br> I understand that men<br> are never asked...<br> why they enter the foreign<br> legion. That's right.<br> They never asked me, and if<br> they had I wouldn't have told.<br> When I crashed the legion,<br> I ditched the past.<br> There's a foreign legion<br> of women, too.<br> But we have no uniforms,<br> no flags.<br> And no medals...<br> when we are brave.<br> No wound stripes<br> when we are hurt.<br> Look here, is there anything<br> I can do to help you?<br> No. I've heard that before.<br> Or do you think you can<br> restore my faith in men?<br> Not me.<br> You've got<br> the wrong man for that.<br> Anybody who has faith in me<br> is a sucker.<br> You better go now.<br> I'm... beginning to like you.<br> I've told women about<br> everything a man can say.<br> I'm gonna tell you something<br> I've never told a woman before.<br> I wish I'd met you<br> ten years ago.<br> Good night.<br> Good night. And thanks.<br> Well, the night's still young.<br> Here's your key, lady. If I were<br> you, I wouldn't hand it around.<br> Tom.<br> I hear something.<br> Taking a walk?<br> Out for some fresh air?<br> No.<br> I was looking for you.<br> It's a good thing<br> you found me.<br> This quarter<br> isn't safe at night.<br> I'd better<br> take you home.<br> No. I wish I were.<br> I only feel<br> so light to you,<br> because your arms<br> are so powerful.<br> Well, we're gonna get along<br> better this time.<br> Look out!<br> You'd better beat it.<br> There's gonna be trouble.<br> I'll give you one more chance.<br> Who were those two women?<br> Get your knee<br> outta my hip.<br> Do you think the two women<br> you are trying to protect...<br> are worth it?<br> Well, I think<br> one of them is.<br> Mon Adjutant,<br> Monsieur La Bessiere is here...<br> to take you to his club. Ask him to<br> wait. I'll be through in a minute.<br> No, let him come in.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Entrez, monsieur.<br> I didn't know the military was<br> quite so busy. Oh yes, we are busy.<br> Sit down.<br> Perhaps you can learn<br> something about this country...<br> which you think<br> is so marvelous.<br> Got a match?<br> This little matter also involves<br> someone you're interested in.<br> I'm properly curious.<br> Bring in that woman.<br> Mademoiselle, I think you<br> know Monsieur La Bessiere.<br> Very happy to meet you<br> again, mademoiselle. Sit down.<br> I'm happy to<br> meet you again.<br> Nice of you to have come,<br> mademoiselle.<br> You were present at this affray<br> in which the prisoner,<br> with his customary bravery,<br> severely wounded<br> two helpless natives.<br> Those natives were not<br> helpless. They attacked us.<br> Who was the other woman?<br> I don't know.<br> I'd like to know too.<br> Uh, do sit down.<br> The curious part<br> of this is...<br> I am the only one that<br> really seems to know...<br> who this other woman...<br> is.<br> If you do know, you'd better<br> keep it to yourself.<br> Careful, Caesar.<br> Don't lose your temper.<br> - Return the prisoner to the guardhouse.<br> - Allez.<br> I appreciate<br> your attempt...<br> to keep the name of my wife<br> out of this.<br> That's all right, sir.<br> You may go now,<br> mademoiselle.<br> I'll join you in a minute.<br> You look charming<br> this morning.<br> What will they do to him?<br> I don't know.<br> Personally, I shouldn't care to<br> have Adjutant Caesar as an enemy.<br> I seem to have<br> the unhappy faculty...<br> of causing trouble<br> wherever I go.<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> You know, I carry<br> some weight with Caesar.<br> Possibly I can help you.<br> Every time a man<br> has helped me,<br> there's been a price.<br> What's yours?<br> My price?<br> A smile.<br> I haven't got much more.<br> Shall we go?<br> There's your pass.<br> You're a free man.<br> The door's open.<br> Do as you like...<br> till 7:00 in the morning.<br> What's the idea of this?<br> You're leaving for<br> Amalfa Pass tomorrow.<br> Not me. I'm beginning<br> to like this town.<br> Tell Caesar I'm not going.<br> You tell him yourself.<br> - He's going along this time.<br> - Who's going along?<br> You heard what I said.<br> Caesar's going along this time.<br> So that's what it is. That's why<br> he didn't recommend a court-martial.<br> He's gonna get me on the road,<br> face me in the proper direction-<br> You've got it comin',<br> haven't ya?<br> You can't get away with<br> murder all your life.<br> That's right.<br> Your argument's perfectly sound,<br> but nobody's going to use me<br> for target practice.<br> I'm through<br> with the army anyway.<br> I've been lookin' for<br> the right kind of woman...<br> and I've found her,<br> so I quit.<br> Take this dame<br> and spend a few weeks...<br> somewhere along<br> the blue Mediterranean.<br> So you quit, eh? Well,<br> nobody's stopping you.<br> By the way, do you happen to<br> remember the penalty for desertion?<br> There's a hundred ways<br> of dyin', brother,<br> and I'm pickin' my own way.<br> Come on, get outta here!<br> He's in there. I never saw<br> such luck in all my life.<br> He's rich enough<br> to buy Morocco.<br> And don't forget me.<br> You met him in my theater.<br> Good evening.<br> Your flowers are wonderful.<br> Any news of him?<br> I did what I could.<br> They will not court-martial him.<br> They're going to transfer him,<br> which means, of course,<br> that he will have to<br> leave town.<br> Do you... love him?<br> I don't know.<br> I hope not.<br> I can't accept this.<br> It's worth a fortune.<br> Anything of less value<br> would be unworthy of you.<br> I've got to change.<br> I'd like to take you<br> away from here.<br> Would you?<br> Exactly what<br> do you offer now?<br> The conventional thing.<br> My offer is highly respectable<br> - marriage.<br> You're a strange man.<br> Do you find it so strange<br> I should be fond of you?<br> Must I answer you now?<br> I'd sleep better tonight<br> if you did.<br> I don't think I care<br> to take advantage...<br> of your tempting offer.<br> - Then you're in love?<br> - No, I don't think I am.<br> Supposing you had never met a<br> certain private in the foreign legion?<br> What would your answer<br> have been?<br> Might have been the same.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm sorry to intrude.<br> I'm leaving for the Sahara in the<br> morning. I came to say good-bye.<br> I think you two<br> want to be alone.<br> I understand you're leaving<br> on a rather strenuous journey.<br> May I wish you good luck?<br> Thanks.<br> A bientot, mademoiselle. A bientot.<br> Will you be gone long?<br> When will I see you<br> again?<br> Maybe never.
