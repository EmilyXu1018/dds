Evil!<br> TOULOUSE:<br> A little shy<br> Turn away from this village of sin!<br> TOULOUSE:<br> And sad of eye<br> But very wise<br> Was he<br> And then one day<br> A magic day<br> He passed my way<br> And while we spoke of many things<br> Fools and kings<br> This he said to me<br> The greatest thing<br> You'll ever learn<br> Is just to love<br> And be loved<br> In return<br> CHRISTIAN:<br> The Moulin Rouge.<br> A nightclub...<br> ...a dance hall and a bordello...<br> ...ruled over by Harold Zidler.<br> A kingdom of nighttime pleasures...<br> ...where the rich and powerful<br> played with...<br> ...the young and beautiful creatures<br> of the underworld.<br> The most beautiful of all these...<br> ...was the woman who I loved.<br> Satine.<br> A courtesan, she sold her love to men.<br> They called her<br> "The Sparkling Diamond."<br> And she was the star...<br> ...of the Moulin Rouge.<br> The woman I loved...<br> ...is...<br> ...dead.<br> I first came to Paris...<br> ...one year ago.<br> lt was 1 899, the Summer of Love.<br> I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,<br> Harold Zidler or Satine.<br> The world had been swept up in<br> a Bohemian revolution, and l had...<br> ...travelled from London to be a part of it.<br> On the hill near Paris<br> was the village of Montmartre.<br> It was not,<br> as my father said--<br> A village of sin.<br> --but the center of<br> the Bohemian world.<br> Musicians, painters, writers.<br> They were known as<br> the Children of the Revolution.<br> Yes. I had come to live a penniless<br> existence. I had come to...<br> ...write about truth, beauty,<br> freedom...<br> ...and that which l believed in<br> above all things: love.<br> Always this ridiculous obsession<br> with love!<br> There was only one problem.<br> I'd never been in love.<br> Luckily, right at that moment, an unconscious<br> Argentinean fell through my roof.<br> [YELLS]<br> He was joined by a dwarf<br> dressed as a nun.<br> How do you do?<br> My name is Henri Marie Raymond<br> Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa.<br> I'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs<br> rehearsing a play.<br> A play. Something very modern called<br> Spectacular Spectacular.<br> It's set in Switzerland.<br> Unfortunately, he unconscious Argentinean<br> suffered from narcolepsy.<br> TOULOUSE: Perfectly fine<br> one moment, then suddenly:<br> [IMITATES SNORING]<br> ...unconscious the next. Ha, ha.<br> AUDREY: How is he?<br> Wonderful. The narcoleptic Argentinean<br> is unconscious.<br> Therefore the scenario will not be finished<br> to present to the financier tomorrow.<br> I still have to finish the music.<br> We just find someone to read the part.<br> Where in heaven's name are we going<br> to find someone to read the role...<br> ...of the young, sensitive<br> Swiss poet goatherder?<br> Before I knew it, I was upstairs, standing in<br> for the unconscious Argentinean.<br> TOULOUSE [SINGING]:<br> The hills animate<br> With the euphonious symphonies<br> Of descant<br> Oh, stop!<br> Stop that insufferable droning!<br> It's drowning out my words!<br> Can we just stick<br> to a little decorative piano?<br> There seemed to be artistic differences<br> over Audrey's lyrics to Satie's song.<br> Don't think a nun would say that<br> about a hill.<br> What if he sings, "The hills are vital<br> intoning the descant"?<br> "The hills quake and shake--"<br> No, no, no. "The hills--"<br> "The hills are incarnate<br> with symphonic melodies"!<br> No.<br> "The hills--" "The hills--"<br> "The hills--"<br> "The hills--"<br> [CHATTERING]<br> [SINGING]<br> The hills<br> Are alive<br> With the sound of<br> Music<br> "The hills are alive with<br> the sound of music." I love it!<br> The hills are alive....<br> With the sound....<br> [SINGING]<br> Of music.<br> It fits perfectly!<br> With songs they have sung<br> For a thousand years<br> [GASPING]<br> Incandiferous!<br> Audrey, you should write the show together.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> But Toulouse's suggestion that<br> Audrey and I write together...<br> ...was not what Audrey wanted to hear.<br> Goodbye!<br> Here's to your first job in Paris.<br> Toulouse, Zidler will never agree.<br> No offense, but have you ever<br> written anything like this before?<br> No.<br> Ah! The boy has talent!<br> I like him.<br> Nothing funny. I just like talent.<br> "The hills are alive<br> with the sound of music."<br> With Christian, we can write...<br> ...the truly Bohemian revolutionary show<br> we always dreamt of.<br> How will we convince Zidler?<br> Toulouse had a plan.<br> Satine.<br> They would dress me<br> in the Argentinian's best suit...<br> ...and pass me off<br> as a famous English writer.<br> Once Satine heard my poetry, she'd be<br> astounded and insist to Zidler that...<br> ...I write Spectacular Spectacular.<br> The only problem was<br> I kept hearing my father's voice:<br> You'll end up wasting your life at<br> the Moulin Rouge with a cancan dancer!<br> I can't write the show for the Moulin Rouge!<br> Why not?<br> I don't even know if I am<br> a true Bohemian revolutionary.<br> Do you believe in beauty?<br> Yes.<br> Freedom?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Truth?<br> Yes.<br> Love?<br> Love? Love?<br> Above all things,<br> I believe in love.<br> Love is like oxygen.<br> Love is a many-splendored thing.<br> Love lifts us up where we belong.<br> All you need is love!<br> See, you can't fool us. You're the voice of<br> the Children of the Revolution.<br> We can't be fooled!<br> Let's drink to the new writer of the world's<br> first Bohemian revolutionary show!<br> It was the perfect plan.<br> I was to audition for Satine<br> and I would taste my first glass of absinthe.<br> VOICE [SINGING]:<br> There was a boy<br> I am the green fairy.<br> [SINGING]<br> The hills are alive<br> With the sound of music<br> [LAUGHING]<br> Freedom, beauty<br> Truth and love<br> The hills are alive<br> With the sound of music<br> CHRISTIAN:<br> We were off to the Moulin Rouge.<br> And I was to perform my poetry<br> for Satine.<br> ZIDLER:<br> The Moulin Rouge.<br> CHRISTIAN:<br> Harold Zidler and his infamous girls.<br> They called them his "Diamond Dogs."<br> [SINGING] Voulez-vous coucher avec moi<br> Ce soir?<br> CHORUS [SINGING]: Hey, sister, go, sister<br> Soul sister, go, sister<br> [SINGING]<br> If life's an awful bore<br> And living's just a chore<br> That you do 'cause death's not much fun<br> I've just the antidote<br> And though l mustn't gloat<br> At the Moulin Rouge<br> You'll have fun<br> So scratch that little niggle<br> Give a little wiggle<br> You know that you can<br> Because we<br> Can cancan<br> Don't say you can't can't can't<br> You know you can cancan<br> Don't say you can't<br> Because you can<br> CHORUS:<br> Here we are now<br> Entertain us<br> We feel stupid<br> And contagious<br> Got some dark desire<br> Love to play with fire<br> Why not let it rip?<br> Live a little bit<br> We can cancan<br> Don't say you can't can't can't<br> You know you can cancan<br> You can cancan<br> Outside, it may be raining<br> But in here it's entertaining!<br> CHORUS: If you love love love<br> To be free free free<br> The Moulin Rouge is the place to be<br> Because we can cancan<br> Yes, we can cancan!<br> Here we are now<br> Entertain us<br> Outside, things may be tragic<br> But in here we feel it's magic<br> The cancan.<br> Because we can cancan<br> CHORUS: Go, sister<br> Soul sister<br> Hey, sister, go, sister<br> Soul sister, go, sister<br> Citchy-citchy yah-yah, dah, dah<br> Citchy-citchy yah-yah here<br> ZIDLER:<br> Because we can cancan<br> Yes, we can cancan<br> CHORUS:<br> Creole Lady Marmalade<br> ZIDLER:<br> Because we can cancan<br> 'Cause it's good for your mind<br> Christian.<br> Mission accomplished.<br> We've successfully evaded Zidler.<br> It's her.
