Answer me, please.<br> Is anything wrong?<br> I have a headache.<br> I'm in bed.<br> Good afternoon, Mrs Mannon.<br> Why, Peter.<br> Hazel, how are you, my dear?<br> Hello, Mrs Mannon.<br> Peter, haven't you seen enough<br> of Lavinia?<br> I haven't seen her in ages.<br> Look at him. He's getting jealous<br> afraid he's got a rival.<br> She isn't sick, is she?<br> Just a headache.<br> I think you're what she needs.<br> Someone to make a fuss over her.<br> What did I tell you?<br> You'll find her in the house.<br> Run along, little boy.<br> You know you're dying to see her.<br> Of course I am. Excuse me.<br> Any more news from Orin?<br> Not since the letter I showed you,<br> my dear.<br> You don't think he's been wounded,<br> do you, Mrs Mannon?<br> Of course not. He's with his father.<br> We'd have heard right away.<br> Oh, there, there, my dear.<br> Vinnie.<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> How are you, Peter?<br> Fine. My wound's all heeled...<br> and I've got orders to leave tomorrow.<br> They'll be cancelled now, I guess.<br> Has the news been confirmed yet?<br> Not yet.<br> You'll hear the fort firing and the salute<br> when it's official.<br> I won't pretend I'm the sort of hero<br> who wants to go back.<br> I've had enough.<br> I guess you'll be glad, too.<br> To get Orin and your father<br> home again.<br> Oh, yes, Father.<br> Oh, I do hope he comes home soon.<br> You love him, don't you?<br> Vinnie, I...<br> I came here to ask you something.<br> You told me once to wait<br> till the war was over.<br> Well, it looks like the war<br> is about over now.<br> I can't marry anyone, Peter.<br> Father will need me.<br> He's got your mother.<br> He needs me more.<br> I'm sorry, Peter.<br> I can't explain...<br> You know how much I do<br> care for you.<br> Why, you and Hazel and Orin and I<br> we grew up together.<br> Don't change that, Peter.<br> Of course I won't, Vinnie.<br> You'll change your mind.<br> Unless you love someone else.<br> How about this mysterious clipper Captain<br> who's been calling on you?<br> Do you think I care anything<br> about that...<br> I only meant folks say he's courting<br> you and...<br> I hate the sight of him.<br> I was afraid that...<br> Well, never mind, I...<br> Who is he, anyway?<br> Well, I... don't know very<br> much about him, really.<br> Mother met him at Grandfather's<br> in New York.<br> He did tell a lot of stories.<br> I didn't pay attention.<br> He went to sea as a boy<br> and he was in California for the Gold Rush.<br> He sailed all over the world.<br> He lived on a South Sea island once.<br> So he says.<br> Sounds romantic.<br> That's his trade.<br> Being romantic.<br> Peter...<br> Did you say anything to Mother<br> about me?<br> What didn't he tell me, Vinnie?<br> He only told me he hadn't seen<br> you for ages, my dear.<br> Vinnie's not herself today, Peter.<br> But don't take it too hard.<br> It's me she's angry at, not you.<br> Well, I guess I'd better run along.<br> Come back tomorrow.<br> She'll be running to you<br> if you don't.<br> Goodbye, Vinnie.<br> Goodbye, Peter.<br> Goodbye, Mrs Mannon.<br> Goodbye, Peter.<br> Now I know why you've been<br> avoiding me all day.<br> A guilty conscience.<br> You don't deny you lied to me about<br> visiting Hazel, do you?<br> No.<br> Well, I have no doubts<br> you'll tell me where you were.<br> I intend to.<br> How was Grandfather Hamil?<br> Much better now.<br> He seems to have been sick so much<br> this past year.<br> He'll soon be doing the rounds<br> with his patients again.<br> He sends you his love.<br> Oh, by the way.<br> I happened to meet<br> Captain Brant on the street in New York.<br> He said he was coming up here today<br> to take over his ship and asked<br> if he might drop in to see you.<br> Doesn't that please you, Vinnie?<br> Is that why you picked the flowers?<br> Because Captain Brant is coming.<br> Haven't you heard the news?<br> It means that Father will be coming<br> home soon.<br> I haven't heard the fort<br> firing any canons.<br> You will.<br> I'm sure I hope so as much as you.<br> You can't say that.<br> You will not take that tone with me,<br> please.<br> I've got to have a talk with you,<br> Mother. Before long.<br> Whenever you wish.<br> You always make such a mystery<br> of things, Vinnie.<br> What are you driving at, Seth?<br> Ain't you noticed this fellow Brant<br> reminds you of someone?<br> Your Pa, ain't it, Vinnie?<br> Father?<br> Yes, he does.<br> That must be why I felt...<br> Yeah.<br> He's like Orin, too.<br> He's like all the Mannons I've<br> ever knowed.<br> And more specially he calls to mind<br> your grandpa's brother, David.<br> Oh, I know his name ain't never been<br> allowed to be spoken<br> among the Mannons since the day<br> he left,<br> but you've likely listened to gossip,<br> ain't ya?<br> There was a nurse girl working<br> in the house.<br> David had to marry her.<br> She was going to have a baby.<br> And your grandpa threw 'em both out.<br> Tore the house down and built<br> this one.<br> What's that whole scandal got to do<br> with Captain Brant?<br> Ain't it funny that no one ever heard<br> tell of David or his wife after they left?<br> Your Grandpa had it out with me one time<br> that she'd had the baby.<br> It was a boy.<br> He was cussing it.<br> Now it's about her baby<br> I've been thinking.<br> No, I can't believe it, no...<br> No, hear, here's another funny thing.<br> His name, Brant.<br> Sounds made up to me.<br> Sounds like it was a short for<br> something else.<br> Remember what that nurse gal's<br> name was?<br> T'was Marie Brantme.<br> Brantme...<br> Oh, don't be stupid, Seth.<br> His name would be Mannon<br> and he'd be more than proud of it.<br> He'd have good reasons not to use<br> the name Mannon<br> when he come calling here,<br> wouldn't he?<br> That would be too horrible, I...<br> All I'm driving at, Vinnie...<br> is that you ought for your Pa's sake<br> to make certain.<br> How?<br> Catch him off guard.<br> Give it to him good and strong.<br> See if he don't give himself away,<br> maybe.<br> Looks like him coming up the drive now.<br> There's something about his walk<br> that brings back David Mannon, too.<br> If I didn't know it was him<br> I'd think it was David's ghost<br> coming home.<br> Use your head, Vinnie, now...<br> Captain Brant.<br> Oh.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Hope you don't mind my walking in on<br> you without ceremony.<br> Your mother told me...<br> She had to go out for a while.<br> I'm in luck then.<br> I haven't had a chance to be alone<br> with you, Lavinia<br> since that night we went walking<br> in the moonlight, do you remember?<br> What do you think of the news<br> of Lee's surrendering, Captain?<br> You're very formal today, Lavinia.<br> We expect my father home<br> very soon now.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, you must be very happy<br> at the thought<br> of seeing your father again.<br> I love Father better than anyone<br> in the world.<br> I suppose that's the usual way of it...<br> the daughter feels closer to her father<br> and a son to his mother.<br> I should think you'd be<br> a born exception to the rule.<br> Why?<br> You're so like your mother<br> in some ways.<br> Both of you call to mind<br> someone who is very dear to me.<br> You'll think it's strange<br> when I tell you.<br> It was my mother.<br> I'm not a bit like Mother.<br> Everyone knows I take after Father.<br> You're very puzzling today,<br> Miss Lavinia.<br> You'll excuse me if I come out<br> with it bluntly<br> but what are you holding against me?<br> Maybe I'm only flattering myself,<br> but I thought you liked me.<br> Have you forgotten that night<br> walking along the shore?<br> Did Mother tell you you could kiss me?<br> Come now, you don't really mean<br> I should have asked her, do you?<br> I wasn't brought up that strictly.<br> Anyway, I didn't.<br> And it wasn't less sweet for that.<br> I'm afraid I gabbed too much<br> that night talking about ships.<br> But you certainly seemed interested<br> when I told you<br> about those islands in the South Seas<br> where I was shipwrecked.<br> I remember your admiration for<br> the native women.<br> You said the'd found the secret of happiness<br> because they'd never heard...<br> that love can be sin.<br> Ay, they live in as near the god<br> in a paradise before sin was discovered<br> as you'll find on this earth.<br> The blessed isles...<br> where one can forget all Man's<br> dirty dreams of greed and power...<br> and dirty dreams of love.<br> Whenever I remember those islands now<br> I'll always think of you, Lavinia.<br> As you walked beside me that night<br> with the moonlight in your eyes...<br> Don't touch me, you liar, you...<br> Lavinia!<br> Quit lying.<br> What else should I expect<br> from the son of a common nurse girl?<br> Belay that!<br> No Mannon can insult her<br> while I'm alive!<br> So it's true. You are her son.<br> And what if I am? My only shame<br> is my dirty Mannon blood.<br> You're too good for the son<br> of a servant, eh?<br> By heavens, you were glad enough<br> that night.<br> I was only leading you on<br> to find out things.<br> Oh, no you weren't.<br> I know how your father stuffed you<br> with these lies about my mother.<br> Do you want to know the truth?<br> So you're a coward, are you?<br> Like all the Mannons...<br> when it comes to facing the truth<br> about themselves.<br> I bet he never told you that your<br> grandfather, Abe Mannon,<br> loved my mother.<br> That's a lie.<br> It was his jealous revenge that made him<br> disown my father<br> and cheat him out of his right<br> to a share of the business.<br> He didn't cheat him,<br> he bought him out.<br> Forced him to sell for next to nothing,<br> you mean.<br> My father was a coward<br> like all the Mannons.<br> He took to drink.<br> One night night he came home crazy drunk<br> and hit my mother in the face.<br> It made me blind mad and I struck him<br> with a poker and cut his head.<br> I told you I don't want to hear.<br> For days afterwards<br> he sat and stared at nothing.<br> One night he went out and<br> didn't come back.<br> Next morning they found him hanging<br> in a barn.<br> It was the only decent thing<br> he ever did.<br> My mother blamed me for it<br> and I ran away to sea.<br> Forgot I had a mother,<br> except that I took part of her name.<br> I wouldn't wear the name of Mannon.<br> When I came back to New York<br> I found her dying<br> of sickness and starvation.<br> She'd sunk her last shred of pride<br> and written to your father for a loan.<br> He never even answered.<br> He could have saved her<br> and he let her die.<br> He's as guilty of murder as anyone<br> he ever sent<br> to the rope when he was a judge.<br> You dare say that about Father.<br> If he were here he'd...<br> I'd tell him what I tell you now.<br> That I swore on my mother's body<br> to revenge her death on him.<br> I suppose you boast you've done it now<br> in the vilest, most cowardly way<br> like a son of a servant you are.<br> Belay, I told you, with that kind of talk.<br> So my mother is your only means of<br> revenge on Father, is that it?<br> I... I don't know what you mean of it.<br> You soon will.<br> And so will she.<br> Lavinia.<br> You wait here until I call you.<br> Really, this unconfirmed report<br> must have turned your head.<br> Sending Annie<br> to say I must see you immediately.<br> Did she tell you I was resting?<br> You better sit down, Mother.<br> More mystery?<br> Perhaps you'd better begin by telling me<br> where you were while I was away.<br> You've admitted you lied.<br> Yes.<br> Where were you.<br> In New York.<br> I followed you.<br> I saw you meet Brant.<br> Well, I told you I ran into him<br> by accident.<br> You went to his room.<br> He asked me to meet a friend of his.<br> A lady.<br> I saw you with him alone.<br> He said he had to talk to me<br> about you.<br> He wanted my help to approach<br> your father.<br> How can you lie like that?<br> How can you be so depraved as to try<br> to use me hide your vile guilt?<br> Vinnie!<br> Stop lying.<br> I saw you in his arms.<br> You're evil and shameless.<br> Even if you are my mother, I say t.<br> I knew you hated me, Vinnie,<br> but not so bitterly as that.<br> Very well, I love Adam Brant.<br> Oh, how you say that.<br> Without any shame.<br> How can you do this to Father?<br> You would understand<br> if you were the wife of a man you hated.<br> Stop talking like that before him.<br> I won't listen.<br> You will listen.<br> I'm talking to you as a woman now.<br> Not as a mother to daughter.<br> That relationship has no meaning<br> between us now.<br> You've called me vile and shameless.<br> Well, I want you to know<br> that's what I felt about myself<br> for over 20 years<br> every time I was in his arms.<br> Stop telling me such things.<br> I loved him once before I married him.<br> But marriage soon turned my love<br> into disgust.<br> So I was born of your disgust.<br> I always guessed that, Mother.<br> Ever since I was little, when I'd run<br> to you with love<br> and you'd always push me away.<br> I hate you. It's only right that<br> I should hate you.<br> Oh, I tried to love you.<br> I told myself it wasn't human<br> not to love my own child,<br> born of my body<br> but I never could make myself feel<br> you were born of anybody but his.<br> You were always my wedding night<br> to me...<br> in my honeymoon.<br> You loved Orin.<br> Why didn't you hate him, too.<br> Because by then I had forced myself<br> to become resigned<br> in order to live.<br> And while I was carrying him<br> your father was with the army in Mexico.<br> I could forget him.<br> When Orin was born...<br> he seemed to be my own child.<br> Only mine.<br> And I loved him for that.<br> I loved him until he let you and your<br> father nag him into this war.<br> It was his duty as a Mannon to go.<br> Well, I hope you realize I never would<br> have fallen in love with Adam<br> if I'd had Orin with me.<br> When he'd gone,<br> there was nothing left but hate<br> and a desire to be revenged.<br> And a longing for love.<br> Then I met Adam. I saw he loved me...<br> He doesn't love you.<br> You're only his revenge on Father.<br> Do you know who he really is?<br> He's the son of that common nurse girl<br> Grandfather put out of our house.<br> So you found that out?<br> Were you hoping it would be a crushing<br> surprise to me?<br> I've known it all along.<br> I suppose that gave you all the more satisfaction<br> to add that disgrace.<br> Will you kindly come to the point<br> and tell me what you intend doing?<br> I suppose you'll hardly let your father<br> get in the door before you tell him.<br> Not unless you force me to.<br> You know Father would disown you publicly<br> no matter what the scandal cost him.<br> Oh, I'd like to see you punished.<br> So please understand this isn't<br> for your sake. It's for Father's.<br> He hasn't been well<br> and I'm not going to have him hurt.<br> I know better than to expect any<br> generosity on my account.<br> Come to the point.<br> I won't tell him provided you give up Brant<br> and never see him again.<br> What a fraud you are, Vinnie.<br> I'm not denying you want to save<br> your father's pride.<br> And I know how anxious you are<br> to keep the family from more scandal.<br> But that's not your real reason<br> for sparing me.<br> It is.<br> You love Adam Brant.<br> You wanted him for yourself.<br> That's a lie.<br> Now you know you can't have him,<br> you're determined to take him from me.<br> Don't be ridiculous.<br> Because of your father,<br> I'd have to go away with Adam...<br> He'd still be mine<br> You can't bear that thought<br> even at the price of my disgrace.<br> Stop it.<br> Oh, I've watched you ever since<br> you were little,<br> trying to do exactly what you're trying<br> to do now.<br> You've always schemed to steal<br> my place with your father and Orin.<br> It's you who stole all love from me<br> from the time I was born.<br> Are you going to do what I told you<br> or not?<br> What if I refuse?<br> Suppose I go off openly with Adam?<br> Where will you and your father<br> and the family be after that scandal?<br> You'd be disgraced more.<br> I'd have the man I love.<br> Not for long.<br> Father would get your lover blacklisted<br> and he'd lose his ship and never get another.<br> And Father won't divorce you, never.<br> You'd be an anchor around Brant's neck.<br> He'd grow to hate the sight of you.<br> Don't forget your age.<br> He'll still be in his prime<br> when you're an old ugly woman.<br> You devil, you mean...<br> I wouldn't call names if I were you.<br> I'm a fool to let you make me lose<br> my temper.<br> But you want my answer,<br> don't you?<br> Well, I agree to do as you say.<br> You promise not to see Brant again?<br> Yes.<br> You'll have to tell him yourself<br> you're through with him.<br> Yes, when he comes.<br> He's waiting outside.<br> Shall I call him in?<br> You seem to take giving him up<br> pretty easily.<br> You think I'll ever give you the satisfaction<br> of seeing me grieve?<br> Oh, no, Vinnie.<br> You'll never have a chance to gloat.<br> I know you're thinking already how<br> you can fool me and break your promise.<br> But you'd better not try it.<br> I'll be watching you every minute<br> and I won't be the only one.<br> I wrote to Father and Orin.<br> About Adam?<br> Only enough so they'll be suspicious<br> and watch you.<br> I see what it's going to mean.<br> That you'll have me under your thumb<br> the rest of my life.<br> Take care, Vinnie. You'll be responsible if...<br> If what?<br> Nothing.<br> I only meant if I went off with Adam.<br> But of course you know I can't do that.<br> There is nothing I can do now<br> but obey your orders.<br> You ought to see it's your duty<br> to Father,<br> and not my orders.<br> Now call him in and<br> tell him what you've got to do.<br> Give me a chance to get out<br> the back way.<br> And I want him out of this house<br> before I get back.<br> If he's not, I'll write Father again.<br> Adam.<br> She knows?<br> Yes. Close the doors.<br> Don't be frightened, Christine.<br> Shenandoah, I long to hear you<br> Way-ay you rollin' river<br> Well, did you put it strong to him<br> like I told you?<br> I made a fool of myself.<br> There's no connection,<br> do you understand?<br> It was just some crazy idea<br> of yours.<br> All right, Vinnie.<br> If you want it left that way,<br> I'll leave it that way.<br> You sound as if you didn't<br> believe me.<br> Sure, sure I believe you.<br> I believe in anything you tell me<br> to believe.<br> I ain't been with the Mannons 60 years<br> without learning that.<br> Seth...<br> Ayeh?<br> What was that Marie Brantme like?<br> Oh, she was always laughing<br> and singing.<br> Frisky and full of life.<br> Talked foreign like your Ma, too.<br> There was somthing wild and free<br> about her.<br> Everyone took to Marie.<br> Even your Paw.<br> Father, too?<br> Ayeh.<br> He was a boy at the time,<br> just feeling his oats.<br> But he was wild about her.<br> That's why he hated her worse<br> than anyone<br> when it got found out<br> that she and his uncle David was...<br> mixed up together.<br> I don't believe that about Father.<br> You've had too much whiskey.<br> We've got to decide what to do.<br> The time for skulking and lying is over<br> and, by heavens, I'm glad of it.<br> It's a coward's game<br> and I've no stomach for it.<br> I simply couldn't believe he would<br> ever come home again.<br> I prayed for him to be killed<br> in the war.<br> Oh, if he were only dead.<br> That chance is finished now.<br> Yes, in that way.<br> What made you sit there?<br> It's his chair.<br> Oh, it's just silly talk about resemblances.<br> When he comes home<br> I'll not give Vinnie the satisfaction<br> of telling him.<br> I'll tell him myself.<br> I'd give my soul to see his face<br> when he finds out that you love<br> Marie Brantme's son.<br> Then I'll take you away openly<br> and we'll laugh at him.<br> If he tries to stop me...<br> What would you do?<br> If I ever laid my hands on him<br> I'd kill him.<br> And be hanged for murder?<br> If I insult him in the street<br> he'll have to fight.<br> Do you imagine<br> you could force him to fight a duel?<br> He'd simply feel bound to do his duty<br> as a former judge<br> and have you arrested.<br> It would be a poor revenge<br> for your mother's death<br> to let him make you a laughing stock.<br> If I take you off on my ship<br> the laugh will be on him.<br> Don't you realize<br> he would never divorce me?<br> What would I be<br> in the eyes of the world?<br> My life would be ruined and<br> I'd ruin yours.<br> You'd grow to hate me.<br> Don't talk like that, Christine.<br> I'll grow old so soon. I'm afraid of time.<br> So my my sailing on your ship<br> you'll find you won't have a ship.<br> He'll get you blacklisted.<br> If he had only been killed.<br> We could be married now.<br> And I would bring you my share<br> of the Mannon fortune.<br> It's only justice.<br> It's what his father stole from yours.<br> You could buy your own ship<br> and be your own master then.<br> That's always been my dream.<br> You've been on board<br> the Flying Trades, Christine.<br> She's as beautiful a ship<br> as you are a woman.<br> If she was mine I'd take you<br> on a honeymoon to China.<br> And on the voyage back<br> we'd stop at the blessed isles<br> I told you about.<br> There's the right place for love<br> and a honeymoon.<br> Yes, but Ezra is alive.<br> I know. It's only a dream.<br> You remember my telling you<br> he had written complaining of pains<br> about his heart.<br> I went to see Dr. Blake,<br> our family doctor,<br> and showed him Ezra's letter.<br> He's the town's worst gossip.<br> I'm sure everybone knows<br> about Ezra's weak heart by this time.<br> What are you driving at, Christine?<br> If he died suddenly now...<br> no one would think<br> it was anything but heart failure.<br> I was reading a book in Father's<br> medical library<br> It was as if some fate in me<br> forced me to see it.<br> I've written it here.<br> You sail for Boston tomorrow,<br> don't you?<br> Get this the minute you reach there.<br> You can make up a story<br> about some sick dog on your ship.<br> As soon as you get it<br> bring it to me here.<br> You can't do a thing like that, Christine.<br> You'll be suspected.<br> He's taking medicine.<br> I'll give him his medicine.<br> I'll blend it carefully.<br> But if he dies suddenly, won't Vinnie...<br> She's worried already about his heart.<br> What about Orin?<br> He'll be coming back, too.<br> Orin will believe anything<br> I want him to.<br> Poison.<br> It's a coward's trick.<br> You think you'd be braver<br> to give me up to him<br> and let him take away your ship?<br> Didn't you say you wanted<br> to kill him?<br> But I'd give him his chance.<br> Did he give your mother her chance?<br> What makes you suddenly so scrupulous<br> about his death?<br> It must be the Mannon in you<br> coming out.<br> Are you going to prove<br> the first time<br> your love is put to a test<br> that you are a weak coward<br> like your father?<br> Christine, if it was any man who<br> said that to me I...<br> Have you ever thought of this?<br> That he's coming back to my bed.<br> Perhaps your love is only a lie<br> you told me<br> to take a cheap revenge on him.<br> Stop!<br> I'll do anything you want.<br> I'm a fool to have any feeling about<br> how Ezra Mannon dies.<br> Now you're the man I love again.<br> Not a hypocritical Mannon.<br> Do you hear?<br> The salute to his homecoming.<br> Remember your dreams<br> of your own ship.<br> Above all, remember you love me.<br> All your own. Your wife.<br> Now you must go.<br> She'll be coming back soon<br> and you're not good at hiding<br> your thoughts...<br> Hurry.<br> I don't want you to meet her.<br> You'll never dare leave me now,<br> Adam.<br> For your ships, or your sea,<br> or your native island girls<br> when I grow old and ugly.<br> Father, oh, Father.<br> Vinnie.<br> Christine.<br> Ezra.<br> You're looking well, Christine.<br> And you're prettier than ever.<br> Compliments from one's husband.<br> How gallant you've become, Ezra.<br> Where is Orin?<br> Orin was wounded.<br> Wounded?<br> I knew it.<br> I knew when you forced him<br> into your horrible war.<br> He's dead, isn't he?<br> Don't say that.<br> It isn't true, is it, Father?<br> Of course it isn't.<br> Your mother's<br> jumping to conclusions about her baby.<br> I've made a man of him, Christine.<br> He did one of the bravest things<br> I've seen in this war.<br> He's still weak but he'll be<br> perfectly all right in a few days.<br> I don't want you to baby him<br> when he comes home, Christine.<br> You needn't worry.<br> That passed when he left me.<br> The carriage is waiting, Ezra.<br> Welcome home, General,<br> welcome home.<br> How are you, Dr. Blake?<br> You've done a great job, sir.<br> This town is proud of you.<br> Terrible news, isn't it,<br> the assassination of President Lincoln?<br> We don't know what's going to happen<br> to the country now.<br> Yes, a frightful calamity.<br> But it can't change the course<br> of events.<br> Let us hope not.<br> You look tired, General.<br> You've been driving yourself too hard<br> for a man of your age.<br> Better let me give you a check-up<br> in a few days<br> as soon as you get rested.<br> I'm perfectly fit.<br> Yes, we know.<br> Well, I won't keep you now.<br> Good night, sir.<br> Good night, Mrs Mannon, Miss Vinnie.<br> Good night, Blake.<br> Father.<br> Oh, Vinnie,<br> I'm looking for your mother.<br> I am out here, Ezra.<br> How is the trouble with your heart,<br> Father?<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> I want to know the truth.<br> If it had been serious I would<br> have told you.<br> If you had seen as much of death as I have<br> in the past four years<br> you wouldn't be afraid of it.<br> I've had my fill of death.<br> What I want now is to forget it.<br> All I know is the pain's like a knife.<br> Puts me out of commission while it lasts.<br> The doctor gave me orders to avoid<br> worry and excitement.<br> You don't look well, Ezra.<br> You must go to bed soon.<br> Yes, I want to.<br> Not yet. Oh, please, Father.<br> We've hardly talked at all.<br> How can you tell him he looks tired.<br> He looks perfectly well.<br> We've so much to tell you.<br> All about Captain Brant.<br> Oh, yes. Vinnie wrote me you'd<br> had company.<br> What business had he here?<br> You'd better ask Vinnie.<br> He's her latest beau.<br> She even went walking<br> in the moonlight with him.<br> You didn't mention that in your letter,<br> young lady.<br> I only went walking with him once.<br> And that was before I...<br> Before what?<br> Before I found out he's the kind who<br> chases after every woman he sees.<br> A fine guest to recieve in my absence.<br> I believe he thought even Mother<br> was flirting with him.<br> That's why I thought<br> it was my duty to write you.<br> I thought you should warn Mother<br> how foolish it was<br> to allow him to come here.<br> Foolish? It was downright...<br> I prefer not to discuss this ridiculous nonsense<br> until we are alone, Ezra,<br> if you don't mind.<br> Vinnie, will you kindly leave us.<br> No, I will not.<br> It's Father's first night...<br> Stop this squabbling, both of you.<br> I won't have it in my house.<br> Vinnie, it must be your bedtime.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Oh, I'm so glad you're home.<br> You're the only man I'll ever love.<br> I'm going to stay with you always.<br> I hope so.<br> I want you to remain my little girl.<br> For a while longer, at least.<br> March now. To bed.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Don't let anything worry you.<br> I'm going to look after you always,<br> Father.<br> Sit down, Ezra.<br> Now, please tell me...<br> just what is it you suspect me of?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Your eyes have been probing me.<br> And all on account of a stupid letter<br> Vinnie had no business to write.<br> There's no question of suspecting you.<br> I only thought it was foolish to give<br> people in town a chance to gossip.<br> We'll say no more about it.<br> But I'd like you to explain<br> how this Brant happened to be here.<br> I'm only too glad to.<br> I met him at Father's.<br> So when he called here<br> I couldn't be rude, could I?<br> And as for gossip the only talk<br> has been he came here to court Vinnie.<br> Ask anyone in town.<br> Blast this impudence.<br> Perhaps I should have watched<br> Vinnie more closely<br> but Father's been sick and...<br> you don't know what a strain<br> I've been under worrying about Orin.<br> And you, Ezra.<br> Christine...<br> I deeply regret having been unjust.<br> Afraid Old Johnny Red<br> would pick me out, were you?<br> Of course.<br> I dreamed of coming home to you,<br> Christine.<br> You look more beautiful than ever.<br> And strange to me.<br> You're younger.<br> I feel like an old man beside you.<br> I'm sorry, Ezra.<br> I'm nervous tonight.<br> I'm tired.<br> I shouldn't have bothered you<br> with this foolishness about Brant tonight.<br> I can't get used to home yet.<br> It's so lonely.<br> I'm used to the feel of camps with<br> thousands of men around me at night.<br> The sense of protection maybe.<br> Don't be so still.<br> I want to talk to you, Christine.<br> I've got to explain some things<br> inside me to my wife.<br> Shut your eyes again.<br> I can talk better.<br> Don't talk, Ezra.<br> It was seeing death all the time<br> in this war.<br> Death was so common it didn't mean<br> anything.<br> That freed me to think of life.<br> Queer, isn't it?<br> Death made me think of life.<br> Before that life had only made me think<br> of death.<br> Why are you talking of death?<br> That's always been the Mannons'<br> way of thinking.<br> They went to the White Meeting House<br> on Sabbath and meditated on death.<br> Life was a dying,<br> being born was starting to die.<br> Death was being born.<br> How did people ever get such notions?<br> What has this talk of death<br> to do with me?<br> Shut your eyes again.<br> I thought about my life<br> lying awake nights.<br> And about your life.<br> As a soldier the thought<br> of my being killed didn't seem to matter.<br> But me as your husband being killed<br> that seemed queer and wrong.<br> Like someone dying that<br> had never lived.<br> And all the years we've been<br> man and wife would rise up in my mind.<br> And I could only find some barrier<br> between us.<br> A wall hiding us from each other.<br> But what that wall was,<br> I could never discover.<br> I called to mind the Mexican War.<br> I could see you wanted me to go.<br> I was hoping I might get killed.<br> Maybe you were hoping that, too.<br> Were you?<br> No, no, I...<br> What makes you say such things?<br> And when I came home<br> you were turned to your new baby, Orin.<br> I was hardly alive for you anymore.<br> I tried not to hate Orin and<br> I turned to Vinnie.<br> But a daughter's not a wife.<br> Then I made up my mind<br> to do my work in the world<br> and leave you alone and not care.<br> That's why the shipping wasn't enough,<br> why I became a judge<br> and Mayor and such vain truck.<br> Why folks in town say I'm so able.<br> Able for what?<br> Not for what I wanted most in life.<br> Not for your love.<br> No, able only to keep my mind<br> from thinking of what I'd lost.<br> You did love me before we were married,<br> didn't you, Christine?<br> You won't deny that, will you?<br> I don't deny anything.<br> All right then. I came home<br> to surrender to you what's inside me.<br> I love you. I loved you then and all the years in between.<br> And I love you now.<br> Ezra, please.<br> Help me to smash down that wall,<br> Christine.<br> We've twenty good years still before us.<br> Help us to get back to each other.<br> If we could leave the children<br> and go on a voyage<br> to get to the other side of the world<br> and find some island<br> where we could be alone for a while.<br> You'll find I've changed, Christine.<br> I'm sick of death. I want life.<br> Stop talking, Ezra!<br> I don't know what you're saying.<br> What must be must be.<br> You make me weak.<br> It's getting late.<br> Yes.<br> Time to turn in.<br> You tell me to stop talking.<br> By heaven, that's funny.<br> I only meant<br> what's the good of words.<br> There is no wall between us.<br> I love you.<br> I'd give my soul to believe that, Christine.<br> But I'm afraid.<br> I thought you'd gone to bed,<br> young lady.<br> I couldn't sleep.<br> I thought I'd walk a little.<br> No time for a walk, if you ask me.<br> We were just going to bed.<br> Your father is tired.<br> See you turn in soon.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Good night, Vinnie.<br> Good night.<br> Father, how can you love<br> that shameless woman?<br> I can't bear it.<br> I won't.<br> It's my duty to tell him.<br> I will!<br> Father! Father!<br> Don't shout like that.<br> What is it?<br> I forgot to say good night.<br> Good heavens. What do you...<br> Oh, all right.<br> Good night, Vinnie.<br> Go to bed soon, like a good girl.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Good night.<br> Christine.<br> What made you jump when I spoke?<br> I thought you were asleep.<br> I haven't been able to sleep.<br> I've been lying here thinking.<br> I haven't been able to sleep either.<br> Don't light the candle.<br> I want to see you.<br> You like the dark where you can't see<br> your old man of a husband, is that it?<br> If you're going to say stupid things<br> I'll go in my own room.<br> Don't go.<br> I don't want to be alone.<br> I feel strange, Christine.<br> You mean ill?<br> Your heart?<br> Is that what you're waiting for?<br> Stop talking like that.<br> Wait.<br> I'm sorry I said that.<br> It isn't my heart.<br> It's as if something in me were...<br> listening.<br> watching<br> waiting for something to happen.<br> This house isn't my house.<br> This room isn't my room.<br> They're empty.<br> Waiting for someone to move in.<br> And you're not my wife.<br> You're waiting for something.<br> What would I be waiting for?<br> For death to set you free.<br> Leave me alone. Stop nagging at me<br> with your crazy suspicions.<br> Not your wife.<br> You act as if I were your wife,<br> your property.<br> You were lying to me as<br> you always lied.<br> You make me feel hateful<br> and unclean to myself.<br> I'd feel more honor between<br> myself and...<br> Look out, Ezra. I won't stand...<br> I was hoping my homecomeing<br> would mark a new beginning<br> a new love between us.<br> I told you my secret feelings.<br> I tore my insides out for you thinking<br> you'd understand.<br> Did you think you could make me<br> forget all the years?<br> Oh, no, Ezra. It's too late.<br> You want the truth?<br> You've guessed it.<br> I've never once been yours.<br> I never could be.<br> Oh, I wanted to be when I married you<br> but you made it so I couldn't.<br> You filled me with disgust.<br> You say that to me.<br> No. Be quiet.<br> We mustn't fight.<br> It'll bring on the pain.<br> You wanted the truth<br> and you're going to get it now.<br> Be quiet, Christine.<br> I lied about Captain Brant.<br> He's Marie Brantme's son.<br> And it was I he came to see,<br> not Vinnie.<br> You dare, the son of that...<br> All my trips to New York<br> weren't to visit Father...<br> but to be with Brant.<br> He's gentle and tender. He's everything<br> you've never been.<br> I love him.<br> You common, vile... I'll kill you.<br> Quick. The medicine.<br> The medicine.<br> Father.<br> He just had an attack.<br> Father.<br> Oh, he's fainted.<br> He's all right now.<br> Let him sleep.<br> Father.<br> She's guilty.<br> Not... medicine.<br> Father.<br> It's my own.<br> He's asleep.<br> He's dead.<br> Why did he point at you like that?<br> Why did he say you were guilty?<br> Well answer me!<br> I told him the truth about Adam.<br> You told him that<br> when you knew his heart...<br> You did it on purpose.<br> You murdered him.<br> No, it was your fault.<br> You made him suspicious.<br> He forced me to tell him.<br> Look at me!<br> He said not medicine.<br> What did he mean?<br> I don't know.<br> You do know. Tell me.<br> Are you accusing your mother of...<br> Yes, I am, you...<br> You can't be that evil.<br> I feel faint.<br> I must go and lie down, I...<br> You murdered him just the same<br> by telling him.<br> You think you'll be free now<br> to marry Adam.<br> But you won't.<br> Not while I'm alive.<br> Father!<br> Don't leave me alone.<br> Come back to me.<br> Tell me what to do.<br> Tell me what to do.<br> It isn't for me to question<br> the arrangements, Mrs Mannon...<br> but it does seem as if Ezra<br> should have been laid out in Town Hall<br> where the whole town<br> could have paid their respects to him.<br> Yes, yes, remember he was<br> mayor of the town, a national war hero...<br> Are you sure you don't want<br> a public funeral?<br> It's not a question of what I want.<br> I must follow out his wishes.<br> Yes, of course...<br> Well, I must say it's just like Ezra,<br> he liked things private and quiet.<br> Never was one for show.<br> Yes, he did the work<br> and let the others do the showing off.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Good night, Mrs Mannon.<br> You have our deepest sympathies.<br> Has Orin come yet?<br> Not yet,<br> but they ought to be here soon.<br> Can't you lie down, Mrs Mannon?<br> No, I should have gone to the train<br> but all those people coming<br> to stand around and stare at the dead.<br> And at me.<br> I know, but there won't be<br> any more now.<br> Come and sit down.<br> I can't abide that woman.<br> There's something queer about her.<br> She looks terrible, doesn't she?<br> Queer the difference between her<br> and Lavinia the way they take his death.<br> Lavinia doesn't seem to fell the grief<br> as much as she ought to.<br> Oh, she feels it all right.<br> Only she's too Mannon to show it.<br> She had a quarrel with her mother, too.<br> I heard it.<br> What was it over?<br> She was going to the train alone.<br> Her mother seemed real angry.<br> She bid Peter Niles go along.<br> Josiah!<br> Coming, Emma.<br> I'm not surprised what's happened.<br> He had angina.<br> I knew it even before he got home<br> from the things he wrote his wife.<br> She was worried about him.<br> Naturally, doctor.<br> The minute they sent for me I knew<br> what had happened.<br> She'd given him his medicine<br> but it was too late.<br> Too bad, too darn bad.<br> The town won't find another<br> as able as Ezra now.<br> No, that's right.<br> Come along, come along, my dear.<br> Orin!<br> Vinnie!<br> Well, you certainly are a sight<br> for sore eyes.<br> How are you, anyway you<br> bossy old fuss-buzzer?<br> Here's Peter.<br> How are you, Peter?<br> Say, how are you, Orin,<br> that's the question.<br> Oh, all right, I guess.<br> Where's Mother?<br> At home.<br> Reverend Hills is there<br> and some other people arranging<br> for the funeral.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, here, let me take care of that.<br> Thanks, Peter.<br> Howdy, Orin.<br> How are you, Seth?<br> Glad to see you.<br> Get on, boy.<br> Home at last.<br> You don't know how I dreamed of this,<br> Vinnie.<br> The house looks ghostly and dead.<br> It's only the moonlight, you chump.<br> Like a tomb.<br> That's what Mother used to call it.<br> It is a tomb just now, Orin.<br> I'd forgotten.<br> I simply can't realize he's dead.<br> I never knew his heart was weak.<br> He told me the trouble wasn't serious.<br> Father told you that?<br> Hm.<br> I was hoping he had.<br> Peter, would you run along inside, please.<br> I want to speak with Orin a moment.<br> Sure. Sure, Vinnie.<br> What's wrong with you, Vinnie?<br> Oh, I know what a shock his death<br> is to you.<br> Isn't it a shock to you, Orin?<br> Certainly, but...<br> Oh, I can't explain. Give me a chance<br> to get used to things.<br> How can you be so unfeeling?<br> You wanted me to be a hero,<br> didn't you?<br> Well, murdering doesn't improve<br> one's manners.<br> Listen, Vinnie, what was that stuff<br> you wrote me about some...<br> Captain Brant coming to see Mother?<br> There's no time to talk now.<br> I want to warn you to be<br> on your guard.<br> Don't believe the lies she'll tell you.<br> Wait till you've talked to me.<br> You mean Mother?<br> What are you talking about, anyway?<br> Honestly, Vinnie, I thinks that's carrying<br> an everlasting squabble with Mother<br> a bit too far.<br> You ought to be ashamed of yourself.<br> What are you being so mysterious<br> about, anyway?<br> Is it Brant?<br> Why didn't you call me, Peter?<br> Orin!<br> Mother!<br> My boy, my baby!<br> Oh, Mother, it's good to see you.<br> Poor darling.<br> How you must have suffered.<br> But it's all over now.<br> I've got you back again.<br> Let's go in, dear.<br> There's someone else waiting who will<br> be glad to see you.<br> Remember, Orin.<br> Come on in, dear.<br> Vinnie, I...<br> I appreciate your grief<br> has made you not quite normal.<br> But now Orin is here, I...<br> Don't stare like that.<br> What did you do that night<br> after I fainted?<br> I've missed something, some...<br> medicine that...<br> I take to make me sleep.<br> You did... you found it.<br> But can't you see<br> how insane to suspect...<br> And Doctor Blake knows<br> he died of...<br> I see what you've been waiting for.<br> To tell Orin your lies<br> and get him to go to the police.<br> Isn't that it?<br> Answer me when I speak to you.<br> What are you plotting?<br> Mother!<br> Coming, dear.<br> The happiness<br> of seeing Orin was a little too much<br> for me.<br> I sudenly felt as if I were going<br> to faint.<br> So I rushed out in the fresh air.<br> Poor Mother.<br> She's worn out, Orin.<br> I've been trying to get her<br> to go to bed<br> but she won't listen to me.<br> Go to bed the minute he comes home?<br> I should say not.<br> You come and sit down.<br> You're not going to do anything<br> to make yourself feel ill...<br> Having you back is the medicine I need.<br> He's the one who needs looking after.<br> Yes, Orin, you've got to take care<br> of yourself too.<br> We'll look after you, Hazel and I,<br> won't we, dear?<br> Of course we will.<br> Don't stand, dear.<br> Come and sit down.<br> Hazel, will you bring me that cushion?<br> We'll make you comfortable.<br> There.<br> Peter will be getting jealous.<br> You'd better call Vinnie<br> and put a pillow behind him.<br> I can't picture Vinnie being so soft.<br> You ought to see her with Father.<br> She was always fussing over him.<br> And he likes it.<br> Even though he does pretend...<br> Orin, you're talking as if he were alive.<br> We'd all of us forgotten he was dead,<br> hadn't we?<br> I can't believe it even yet.<br> I feel him in this house, alive.<br> Orin!<br> Everything's changed in a queer way.<br> This house, all of us.<br> Except Father.<br> He'll always be here, the same.<br> Don't you feel that, Mother?<br> You mustn't make her think of it, Orin.<br> You're the same, Hazel.<br> Sweet and good.<br> At least Hazel hasn't changed.<br> Hazel will never change, I hope.<br> I'm glad you appreciate her.<br> Poor boy.<br> Does it pain now?<br> Not much.<br> Not at all when your hand's there.<br> You're so different. What is it?<br> It's just that I'm getting old, dear.<br> You're more beautiful than ever.<br> And younger, too, somehow.<br> That's not it.<br> Maybe I can guess.<br> Younger and more beautiful.<br> Listen to that, Hazel.<br> He's learned to be very gallant,<br> I must say.<br> Do you remember, Hazel,<br> how you waved your handkerchief to me<br> that day I set out to become a hero?<br> I thought you'd sprain your wrist.<br> Orin.<br> All the mothers and wives,<br> and sisters and girls are the same.<br> Some time, in some war...<br> they ought to make the women<br> take the men's place for a month or so.<br> Give them a taste of murder.<br> After that, maybe they'd stop...<br> waving handkerchiefs and gabbing<br> about heros.<br> Orin...<br> Give it a rest, Orin, it's over.<br> None of us liked it any more than you did.<br> You're right, Peter.<br> I'm sorry, Hazel.<br> That was rotten of me.<br> It was nothing.<br> I understand how you feel,<br> really I do.<br> Orin, come and see Father.<br> You sounded just like him.<br> I meant to look at him the first thing,<br> but...<br> I got to talking<br> No, wait!<br> Can't you let him have a minute<br> to rest?<br> You can see how worn out he is.<br> I've hardly had a chance to say<br> a word to you yet.<br> Stay with me a little while,<br> won't you, dear?<br> Of course, Mother.<br> Don't be long, Orin.<br> And remember what I said.<br> I think we must be getting home.<br> Yes, we must.<br> It was so kind of you to come.<br> Please come again, dear, soon.<br> You'll do Orin more good than anyone.<br> Good night, Orin.<br> Nice to have you back.<br> Good bye.<br> What's made you take<br> a fancy to Hazel all of a sudden?<br> You never used to like<br> my going around with her.<br> All I want now is your happiness, dear.<br> I know how much<br> you used to like Hazel.<br> It was just to make you jealous.<br> I haven't been home an hour<br> and you're trying to marry me off.<br> Must be anxious to get rid of me.<br> Don't say that.<br> Who is this Captain Brant<br> who's been calling on you?<br> On me? You mean on Lavinia,<br> don't you?<br> Wherever did you get that silly idea?<br> Of course. Vinnie must have written you<br> the same nonsense she did your father.<br> She wrote him?<br> What did he do?<br> Why, he laughed at it, naturally.<br> I'm really worried about Vinnie,<br> dear.<br> She imagines the most fantastic things.<br> And that silly feud she's always had<br> with me is worse than ever.<br> She's not like us, Orin.<br> I feel you are really my<br> flesh and blood.<br> She isn't, she's your father's.<br> You are a part of me.<br> I feel that too, Mother.<br> We had a secret little world of our own<br> in the old days, didn't we?<br> No Mannons allowed,<br> that was our password.<br> It's what your father and Vinnie<br> could never forgive us.<br> It may seem a hard thing to say<br> about the dead,<br> but the truth is your father<br> was jealous of you.<br> He hated you because he knew<br> I loved you better<br> than anything in the world.<br> I knew he had it in for me...<br> but I never thought he went so far<br> as to hate me.<br> He did, just the same.<br> All right, then,<br> I won't pretend I'm sorry he's dead.<br> Oh, how happy we'll be together,<br> you and I.<br> If you only won't let Vinnie<br> poison your mind against me<br> with her disgusting lies.<br> What lies?<br> You haven't told me about<br> that Brant yet.<br> There's nothing to tell.<br> Except in Vinnie's morbid mind.<br> She worried and brooded<br> until I really believed<br> she went out of her head.<br> She does seem strange, but...<br> Her craziness all works out in hatred for me.<br> Take this Captain Brant of hers,<br> for example.<br> A stupid ship captain I happened to meet<br> at your grandfather's...<br> took it into his silly head to call here<br> a few times without being asked.<br> I honestly believe<br> Vinnie fell in love with him<br> but she soon discovered<br> that he wasn't after her at all.<br> Whom was he after? You?<br> Orin,<br> you don't seem to realize<br> that I'm an old married woman<br> with two grown-up children.<br> All he was after was to insinuate<br> himself as a family friend<br> and use your father when<br> he came home<br> to get him a better ship.<br> Oh, I soon saw through his little scheme<br> and he'll never call here again,<br> I promise you that.<br> That's the whole of the great<br> Captain Brant scandal.<br> Are you satisfied now,<br> you jealous goose, you?<br> Mother.<br> I'm a fool.<br> The war has got me silly, I guess.<br> It was Vinnie's fault<br> you ever went to war.<br> I'll never forgive her for that.<br> But I was going to give you<br> an example<br> of her insane suspicions.<br> She decided that<br> because his name was Brant<br> he must be the son of that nurse girl,<br> Marie Brantme.<br> Isn't that crazy?<br> Do you imagine for a moment if he were,<br> he would ever come here to visit?<br> I'd like to see him try it.<br> His mother brought disgrace<br> enough on our family without...<br> Orin, don't look like that.<br> You sound just like your...<br> But I haven't told you the worst yet.<br> Vinnie actually accuses me,<br> your mother,<br> of being in love with that fool.<br> And of having met him in New York<br> and gone to his room.<br> I don't believe it. Vinnie couldn't.<br> I told you she had gone crazy.<br> Oh, it's too revolting, Orin.<br> You don't know what I've had<br> to put up with.<br> Mother, please.<br> Please, Mother, don't cry.<br> Please.<br> I haven't told you<br> the most horrible thing of all.<br> She suspects me<br> of having poisoned your father.<br> What?<br> That's too much.<br> She ought to be put in an asylum.<br> She found some medicine I take<br> to put me to sleep<br> and, to her crazy brain...<br> Oh, Orin, I'm so afraid of her.<br> She might even go to the police and...<br> There, there, Mother, don't worry.<br> I'll take care of her.<br> Orin, you are my boy,<br> my baby.<br> Mother!<br> I could forgive you anything,<br> anything.<br> Except that about Brant.<br> I swear to you...<br> I know, Mother.<br> And if I thought different<br> I'd show you I haven't been taught<br> to kill for nothing.<br> Orin!<br> You sound horrible and cruel.<br> There, there...<br> We won't ever think about it again.<br> We shouldn't be talking of these things<br> after what you've been through.<br> You don't look well, Mother.<br> You have to get some rest.<br> You need peace and quiet.<br> Yes, peace.<br> Not now.<br> Do you remember the way<br> I used to sit here?<br> Poor boy.<br> You've had a hard time,<br> haven't you?<br> I wanted to desert and run home.<br> Or else get killed.<br> If you only knew how I longed<br> to be here with you.<br> Like this.<br> Do you remember that book we read?<br> About the South Sea Islands.<br> Yes.<br> All the time I was at the front I kept<br> thinking of those islands.<br> They came to me in everything<br> that wasn't war, everything that was...<br> peaceful and...<br> warm and secure.<br> I'd dream I was there.<br> Later on...<br> when I got this...<br> all the time I was out of my mind...<br> I actually seemed to be there.<br> There was no one there but<br> you and me and...<br> I was a child again.<br> And the funny part is that...<br> I never saw you...<br> I just felt you all around me.<br> The breaking of the waves<br> was your voice...<br> the sky was your eyes.<br> The whole island was you.<br> It was the most beautiful island<br> in the world.<br> Oh, if only you had never gone away.<br> I'll never leave you again.<br> I don't want Hazel or anyone.<br> You're my only girl.<br> Oh, Mother, it's going to be so wonderful<br> from now on.<br> We'll get Vinnie to marry Peter and then<br> we'll be just you and I.<br> What do you want?<br> Aren't you going down to see Father,<br> Orin?<br> Oh, all right.<br> I'll go now.<br> Vinnie!<br> You can go ahead now<br> and tell Orin anything you wish.<br> I told him how you lied<br> about my trips to New York.<br> For revenge.<br> Because you loved Adam Brant yourself.<br> So hadn't you better leave Orin<br> out of it?<br> You can't get him to go<br> to the police.<br> And you are afraid to yourself, because<br> it would all come out.<br> Everything. Who Adam is and<br> your knowledge of it.<br> And your love for him.<br> Oh, believe me, I'd see to it<br> if it ever got to a trial.<br> I'll show you to the world as a daughter<br> who desired her mother's lover.<br> And then tried to get her mother<br> hanged out of hatred and jealousy.<br> Go on. Try and convince Orin<br> of my wickedness.<br> He loves me. He hated his father.<br> He's glad he's dead.<br> Who are you? Just another corpse.<br> You and I have seen fields and hillsides<br> sown with them.<br> And they meant nothing.<br> Nothing but a dirty joke<br> life plays on life.<br> Death sits so naturally on you.<br> Death becomes the Mannons.<br> You were always like the statue<br> of some eminent dead man<br> sitting on a chair in a park or straddling<br> a horse on a town square.<br> looking out over the head of life<br> cutting it dead for the impropriety<br> of living.<br> You never cared to know me in life,<br> old Stick-in-the-Mud.<br> But I really think we might<br> be friends now.<br> Orin.<br> Don't sneek around like that.<br> I'm jumpy enough without...<br> What makes you say such a thing<br> to Father?<br> Have you no feeling?<br> You folks at home take death<br> so solemnly.<br> You have to learn to mock<br> or go crazy.<br> But the name you called him.<br> That was his nickname in the army.<br> Old Stick-in-the-Mud.<br> Grant himself started it.<br> Said that Father was no good<br> on the offensive, but...<br> he'd trust him to stick in the mud<br> and hold a position<br> until the cows come home.<br> But he was your father and he's dead.<br> You ought to be proud of him.<br> He was proud of you when he<br> came home.<br> He boasted you'd done one of<br> the bravest things in the war.<br> I'll tell you the joke of that<br> heroic deed.<br> I was always volunteering for extra danger.<br> I was so scared that anyone<br> would guess I was afraid.<br> Well...<br> that night there was a thick mist.<br> I met a Reb crawling toward our lines.<br> His face drifted out of the mist<br> toward mine.<br> I shortened my sword<br> and let him have the point<br> just under the ear.<br> He stared at me with an idiotic look...<br> as if he'd sat on a tack.<br> His eyes dimmed and went out.<br> Don't think about that now.<br> Before I got back I had to kill another<br> the same way.<br> It felt like murdering the same man twice.<br> I had a queer feeling that war meant<br> murdering the same man<br> over and over and...<br> and that in the end<br> the man turned out to be myself.<br> Their faces keep coming back<br> in dreams.<br> They change to Father's and...<br> to mine...<br> For heaven's sake, forget the war.<br> It's over now.<br> Not inside us who've killed.<br> The rest is all a joke.<br> Next morning I was in the trenches.<br> My head was queer.<br> I thought, what a joke it would be<br> on the stupid Generals like Father if...<br> everyone on both sides suddenly saw<br> the joke war was on them<br> and laughed and shook hands.<br> So I began to laugh and walked<br> towards their lines with my hand out.<br> Of course the joke was on me.<br> I got this wound in the head.<br> Then I went mad, wanted to kill<br> and ran on yelling.<br> A lot of our fools went crazy, too<br> and followed me.<br> And we captured a part of their lines<br> we hadn't dared to tackle before.<br> So, do you wonder I laugh.<br> But you are brave, and you know it.<br> I'm proud of you too.<br> Oh, all right, then.<br> Be proud.<br> Well, fire away. Let's get this over.<br> I know what you're going to say.<br> How can you think such things of Mother.<br> What's got into you?<br> Has she convinced you<br> I'm out of my mind?<br> Look at me.<br> I've never lied to you, have I?<br> It's not a question of lying.<br> But if you think I'm going to listen<br> to a lot of crazy stuff about Mother,<br> you're mistaken.<br> If you don't, I'll go to the police.<br> Do you actually believe...<br> I accuse her of murder.<br> You see this?<br> I found it by her hand right after<br> Father died.<br> Don't be a lunatic.<br> That's just some stuff she takes<br> to make her sleep.<br> Father knew she'd poisoned him.<br> He said to me she's guilty.<br> That's all your crazy imagination.<br> Do you realize you're deliberately<br> accusing your own mother...<br> I'll have you declared insane by Dr. Blake<br> and put away in an asylum.<br> I swear by our dead father that I'm<br> telling you the truth.<br> Make Orin believe me, Father.<br> Don't drag him into this.<br> He always sided with you against<br> Mother and me.<br> Here, give me that.<br> So you're afraid it's true.<br> I'm not going to talk to a crazy woman.<br> You're still a spoiled cry baby<br> she can twist around her finger.<br> That's enough from you.<br> She warned me<br> you wouldn't believe me.<br> Are you such a coward you're willing<br> to let her lover go unpunished?<br> Who do you mean?<br> I mean the man who must have got<br> the poison for her.<br> Captain Brant.<br> You lie. She told me all your rotten lies<br> about following her to New York...<br> What a fool you are, Orin.<br> She kisses you and pretends<br> she loves you.<br> All she thinks about is Brant.<br> Stop, I won't stand...<br> All she's thinking right now<br> is how she can use you against me<br> so she can run off and marry him.<br> You lie.<br> I saw her in his arms kissing him.<br> Tell me you're lying or...<br> You know I'm not lying.<br> You're not insane.<br> You know what you're saying but...<br> you'll have to prove it, otherwise...<br> There is a chance to prove it.<br> And when I do will you help me punish<br> Father's murderers?<br> I'll kill him.<br> But it's only your word against hers.<br> She'll go to Brant<br> the first chance she gets.<br> Would you believe me<br> if you found them together?<br> Yes.<br> Just let me get my hands on him.<br> Orin.<br> I can't face her now.<br> Pretend you think I'm insane.<br> She wanted you to.<br> Orin.<br> Why don't you answer me?<br> Why have you locked me out?<br> Let me in.<br> Answer her.<br> Let her in.<br> All right, Mother.<br> I'm coming.<br> Wait.<br> Now open the door.<br> Orin.<br> Let me in.<br> Orin.<br> I got so afraid<br> when I found the door locked.<br> What made you afraid, Mother?<br> Why do you look at me like that?<br> You look so like your father.<br> I'm his son too, remember that.<br> Orin.<br> I suppose you've been telling him<br> your vile lies.<br> She's out of her mind, Mother.<br> I knew you'd say that.<br> I know she's plotting something, Orin.<br> Did she threaten to go to the police?<br> They might not realize she's crazy.<br> You won't let her do anything dreadful<br> like that, will you?<br> No, Mother.<br> No...<br> Remember your father wouldn't want<br> any scandal.<br> He mustn't be worried, he said.<br> He needs rest and peace.<br> You haven't changed, Ezra.<br> You were always dead to me.<br> I hate the sight of death.<br> Mother, be quiet!<br> Why did I come back to life<br> from my island of peace?<br> That's lost now.<br> You're my lost island,<br> aren't you, Mother?<br> Orin.<br> It was Brant who got you this medicine<br> to make you sleep, wasn't it?<br> No, no, no.<br> You're telling me it was. I knew it.<br> I wanted to make sure.<br> Vinnie.<br> Keep Orin out of this. He's changed.<br> He's grown hard and cruel.<br> Have mercy, Vinnie. Don't let Orin...<br> Ezra...<br> Don't let her harm Adam.<br> I am the only guilty one.<br> Don't let Orin...<br> I'm going to see Adam.<br> I've got to warn him.<br> Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you<br> A-way my rolling river<br> Oh, Shenandoah, I can't get near you<br> Way-ay, I'm bound away<br> Across the wide Missouri.<br> Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter<br> A-way my lonely river<br> Like him, a coward.<br> Aye, it's the rotten Mannon blood in me.<br> Who's there?<br> Adam.<br> Christine.<br> Go to the gangway.<br> I'll meet you there.<br> Orin.<br> Don't be a fool. He'll kill you.<br> Oh, Adam.<br> I am so frightened.<br> Is something wrong?<br> What is it, Christine?<br> Vinnie knows.<br> What's she going to do?<br> I don't know.<br> How did you get away?<br> She followed you once before.<br> I thought I heard someone.<br> No, it's all right.<br> I made Orin believe she's<br> out of her head with grief, insane.<br> He decided that a change of scene<br> would bring her back to her senses.<br> He took her this morning to Blackridge<br> to visit their cousins.<br> I had to come and warn you.<br> Oh, Adam, we've got to plan.<br> There isn't much time.<br> Shhh.<br> We're fools to be talking out here.<br> I'll kill him now, in front of her.<br> Stop thinking of her.<br> Think of Father, think of the family,<br> of us.<br> Don't be crazy.<br> When he was dying he pointed at me<br> and told her I was guilty.<br> Then she found the poison.<br> For heaven's sake, why didn't...<br> I fainted before I could hide it.<br> How could I foresee she<br> would come in just at that moment?<br> And how could I know he would talk<br> to me the way he did?<br> I only wanted him to die<br> and leave me alone.<br> But he knew before he died<br> whose son I was.<br> Good!<br> Oh, I planned it so carefully.<br> But something made things happen.<br> I should have done as I wanted.<br> Fought with Ezra Mannon as two men<br> fight for the love of a woman.<br> I have my father's rotten blood in me,<br> I think.<br> It's too late for regrets now.<br> We have to think what to do.<br> I'm so terrified of Vinnie.<br> If she convinces Orin...<br> Oh, why can't we go away, Adam?<br> My ship won't be sailing for a month.<br> Can't we go on another ship?<br> Everyone in town would know<br> that you'd gone.<br> It would start suspicion.<br> No, Orin and Vinnie would lie to people.<br> They'd have to, for their own sakes.<br> Oh, Adam, if we don't get out of Vinnie's<br> reach right away<br> something horrible will happen.<br> Aye, I suppose it's the only way.<br> The Atlantis sails on Friday for China.<br> I'll arrange with the skipper to give us passage.<br> You'd better meet me here<br> Thursday night.<br> I'll write the owners<br> they'll have to find a new skipper<br> for the Flying Trades.<br> Poor Adam.<br> I know how it hurts you<br> to give up your ship.<br> There are plenty of ships.<br> There's only one you, Christine.<br> I brought you nothing but misfortune.<br> You brought love.<br> The rest is only the price.<br> It's worth it a million times.<br> You're all mine now anyway.<br> Try not to regret your ship<br> too much, Adam.<br> Let's not talk about it anymore.<br> I'll give up the sea.<br> I thinks it's through with me, anyway.<br> The sea hates a coward.<br> Don't talk like that.<br> We'll be happy once we're safe<br> on your blessed islands.<br> It's strange.<br> Orin was telling me of an island.<br> Aye, the blessed isles.<br> Maybe we can still find happiness<br> and forget.<br> I can see them now.<br> The warm earth in the moonlight...<br> The trade winds rustling the palms...<br> The surf on the barrier reef crooning<br> in your ears like a lullaby.<br> Aye, there's peace and forgetfulness<br> for us there.<br> If we can ever find those islands now.<br> We will find them.<br> We will.<br> I've got to go now.<br> Watch out for Vinnie.<br> If anything happened to you now...<br> Nothing will happen to me.<br> But you must be on your guard<br> in case Orin...<br> Oh, be careful, Adam.<br> I feel so strange.<br> So sad.<br> As if I'd never see you again.<br> Tell me we are going to be happy.<br> Of course we'll be happy.<br> Come now.<br> It's only a couple of days.<br> Let me go.<br> No. Be quiet.<br> Come to his cabin.<br> Death is too good for him.<br> He ought to be...<br> Orin, you promised not to lose your head.<br> Did you hear her warn him<br> against me?<br> And the island that I told her about.<br> She wants to go there with him.<br> Why did you stop me?<br> I'd have shot his guts out<br> in front of her.<br> Outside on deck where the shot<br> could be heard?<br> We'd be arrested.<br> I'd have to tell the truth to save you.<br> She'd be hanged<br> but even if we managed to get off<br> our lives would be ruined.<br> Father's name would be disgraced.<br> The only person to come off lucky<br> would be Brant.<br> He'd die happy knowing<br> he'd been revenged on all of us.<br> Is that what you want?<br> No.<br> Then don't act like a fool again.<br> He's coming.<br> Go, then. Go on.<br> So it's goodbye to you, Flying Trades.<br> I wasn't man enough for you.<br> Don't stand there.<br> Remember the plan.<br> Smash open everything in his stateroom.<br> Take everything valuable.<br> You've got to make it look<br> like the work of thieves, remember.<br> Hurry.<br> Hurry, Orin.<br> Don't tell me what to do.<br> How could you love<br> that vile old woman so?<br> But you did.<br> It's ended.<br> May God find forgiveness<br> for your sins.<br> May the soul of our cousin, Adam Mannon,<br> rest in peace.<br> Rest in hell, you mean.<br> I've pried open everything<br> I could find.<br> Come along, quickly.<br> I must go through his pockets first<br> to make it look like a robbery.<br> I'll sink this stuff from the dock.<br> There's the pistol. Don't forget it.<br> Orin.<br> He looks like Father.<br> Come along.<br> Just like my dream.<br> I've killed him before, over and over.<br> It's like me, too.<br> Maybe I've committed suicide.<br> Orin.<br> If I were in his place<br> I would have done what he did.<br> I'd have loved her as he loved her.<br> And killed Father, too, for her sake.<br> For heaven's sake,<br> do you want us to be caught here?<br> It's queer.<br> It's a rotten dirty joke on someone.<br> Orin. Vinnie.<br> It's me, Ma'am.<br> I was just going down the street.<br> You're sure you met the train<br> from Blackridge?<br> Ayeh, weren't a sign of 'em.<br> They should have been back<br> this morning.<br> I'm worried. And frightened.<br> You want I should stay here?<br> No.<br> You oughta try to get some sleep,<br> Ma'am.<br> Sleep.<br> I don't believe there is such a thing<br> on this earth as sleep.<br> It's only in the earth one sleeps.<br> One must feel so at peace at last,<br> with all one's fears ended.<br> Why do you stare at me like that?<br> You Mannons. I hate you.<br> Why am I so afraid?<br> Orin. Vinnie.<br> So this time at least you're waiting<br> to meet me when I come home.<br> Orin...<br> I've been so frightened.<br> You stayed all this time at Blackridge?<br> We didn't go to Blackridge.<br> We took the train there but we decided<br> to stay right on and go to Boston instead.<br> To Boston?<br> And in Boston we waited till<br> the evening train came in.<br> We had an idea you might be on it<br> and you were.<br> We followed you<br> when you called on your lover.<br> Orin, how dare you talk like...<br> Don't lie.<br> I was on deck listening.<br> What would you have done<br> if you discovered me?<br> Would you have gotten him<br> to murder me, Mother?<br> Orin, what have you done? Tell me.<br> I killed him.<br> Oh, no, Orin. You're just telling that to me to punish me, aren't you?<br> You said you loved me,<br> protect me. Protect your mother.<br> You couldn't murder.<br> You could murder Father, couldn't you?<br> Here. Read this if you don't believe me.<br> We waited and got it in Boston<br> to see whom the police would suspect.<br> They'll think he was killed<br> by waterfront thieves.<br> There's nothing to connect us<br> with his death.<br> Mother, don't moan like that.<br> How can you grieve for that swine?<br> I know it was he who planned<br> Father's murder.<br> You couldn't have done that.<br> He got you under his influence<br> so as to revenge himself.<br> I knew you weren't yourself<br> the moment I got home, remember?<br> How else could you have imagined<br> you loved the son of a servant?<br> How else could you ever have said<br> the things you...<br> I heard you planning to go with him<br> to the island.<br> Our island.<br> Mother, don't moan like that.<br> You'll forget him.<br> I'll make you forget him.<br> We'll leave Vinnie here and we'll go away<br> on a long voyage to the South Seas.<br> Orin.<br> Mother. Mother.<br> Didn't you hear me?<br> Mother, why don't you speak to me?<br> Answer me.<br> Tell me you forgive me.<br> Orin. After all that's happened<br> are you becoming her cry baby again?<br> Mother, please.<br> Leave her alone.<br> Go in the house.<br> Do you hear me?<br> March!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Why are the shutters still closed?<br> Father's gone.<br> They ought to let in the moonlight.<br> You know it was justice.<br> It was the only true way justice<br> could be done.<br> He paid the just penalty for his crime.<br> Mother.<br> What are you going to do?<br> You can live.<br> Live?<br> It is justice.<br> It is justice.<br> It's your justice, Father.<br> Mother!<br> Mother!<br> Mother!<br> Vinnie!<br> She had Father's pistol.<br> Get a doctor.<br> Orin!<br> No, it's too late. She's dead.<br> Why, why did she, Vinnie?<br> I drove her to it.<br> She couldn't forgive me.<br> Why did I boast of killing him, why?<br> Be quiet.<br> Why didn't I let her believe<br> the burglars killed him?<br> Then she would've forgiven me.<br> Then she would have turned from him<br> and turned to me...<br> I murdered her.<br> Shhh. Be quiet, Orin.<br> I've got to find her.<br> I've got to make her forgive me.<br> Orin...<br> You still have me, haven't you?<br> I love you.<br> I'll take you away.<br> I'll help you forget, Orin.<br> Say, Vinnie.<br> Did you hear a gun go off?<br> I want you to go for Dr. Blake.<br> Tell him that Mother has killed herself<br> in a fit of insane grief over<br> Father's death.<br> Will you remember to tell him that?<br> Ayeh, I'll tell him.<br> Anything you say, Vinnie.<br> Orin.<br> Orin, we're home.<br> Seth. You can bring our things up<br> after you've put up the horses.<br> Ayeh.<br> What are you afraid of, Orin?<br> This is the test.<br> You've got to face it, Orin.<br> Hazel and Peter are waiting inside.<br> Don't you want to see Hazel?<br> Why don't you look at the house?<br> Orin.<br> I want you to look at it now.<br> Do you hear me?<br> Well.<br> You don't see any ghosts, do you?<br> No.<br> Let's go in.<br> It was here she...<br> the last time I saw her alive.<br> That's all passed and finished.<br> Why do you look at me like that?<br> I've done my duty to you.<br> That's finished and forgotten.<br> Mother!<br> Mo... What...<br> Orin.<br> Orin, what is it?<br> She's not here.<br> She's not anywhere.<br> Orin, will you be quiet.<br> Well, let her go, then.<br> I'm not her son any more.<br> I'm Father's. I'm a Mannon.<br> Stop it. Do you hear me?<br> Don't be angry, Vinnie.<br> I'm not angry, dear.<br> But do get hold of yourself.<br> You frighten me<br> when you act so strangely.<br> I want to talk to you<br> before we see Peter and Hazel.<br> Won't you be happy to see Hazel<br> again?<br> Their friendship and love will help us<br> more than anything to forget.<br> Forget?<br> I thought you'd forgotten long ago,<br> if you ever remembered.<br> Love. What right have I or you<br> to love?<br> Every right.<br> Mother felt the same about him.<br> You've no idea how like Mother<br> you've become, Vinnie.<br> I mean the change in your soul.<br> I've watched it ever since we sailed<br> for the East.<br> It's as if her death had set you free to...<br> to become her.<br> What's come over you, Orin?<br> You haven't had one of these<br> morbid spells since we left the islands.<br> I had to get you away from the islands.<br> My brotherly duty.<br> If we had stayed there much longer...<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> I only went there for your sake.<br> Yes...<br> But afterwards...<br> You promised me you weren't going to talk<br> any more morbid nonsense.<br> Come sit down.<br> I want you to start again by facing<br> all your ghosts<br> so that you can rid yourself<br> of your silly guilt.<br> Who murdered Father?<br> Brant did, for revenge.<br> Who murdered father?<br> Answer me.<br> Mother was under his influence.<br> That's a lie.<br> It was he who was under hers.<br> She betrayed Father and murdered him,<br> didn't she?<br> Yes.<br> And if we'd done our duty, under the law<br> she would have been hanged, wouldn't she?<br> Yes.<br> But we protected her.<br> She could have lived<br> but she chose to kill herself.<br> It was an act of justice.<br> You had nothing to do with it.<br> You see that now, don't you?<br> Tell me.<br> Yes.<br> And your feeling of being responsible<br> for her death<br> was only your morbid imagination.<br> You don't feel it now.<br> You'll never feel it again.<br> No.<br> There.<br> There, you see you can do it<br> when you make up your mind to.<br> Now, don't cry.<br> You ought to feel proud.<br> You've proven that you can laugh<br> at all your ghosts from now on.<br> Shhh. Someone's coming, Orin.<br> Well. We might as well<br> begin making ourselves useful.<br> Vinnie.<br> Peter.<br> You've grown so like your...<br> Gosh, you look wonderful, Vinnie.<br> Gee, but you've changed.<br> You haven't gone and changed,<br> have you?<br> You ought to know I'd never change...<br> with you.<br> You haven't said you're glad to see me.<br> Well I...<br> You know how much I...<br> Vinnie, you look so darned pretty and...<br> and healthy.<br> Your trip certainly did you good.<br> I used to be an awful old stick,<br> didn't I?<br> Who said so? You were not, but...<br> you just didn't use to...<br> dress like that and...<br> I was dead then.<br> Oh, Orin, I didn't see you.<br> How are you?<br> Orin, didn't you hear Peter?<br> Don't be rude.<br> Oh, give him a chance.<br> I'm darned glad to have you back,<br> Orin.<br> Thanks, Peter.<br> Vinnie's still the same<br> bossy old fuss-buzzer, isn't she?<br> Always trying to teach me manners.<br> Say, hasn't she changed, though?<br> I hardly know her.<br> Maybe it's that dress.<br> Ask her why she gets herself up<br> like Mother.<br> I can't see why...<br> yet<br> And I don't think she knows herself,<br> but...<br> it'll prove to be a strange reason,<br> I'm certain of that when I do discover it.<br> Don't mind him, Peter.<br> She's grown romantic, too, imagine that.<br> Influence of the islands, eh, Vinnie?<br> They turned out to be her islands,<br> not mine.<br> I guess I'm too much of a Mannon<br> to turn into a pagan, after all.<br> But you should have seen Vinnie<br> with the men.<br> Orin, how can you?<br> Handsome and romantic-looking,<br> weren't they, Vinnie?<br> Especially the fellow they called<br> Avahanni.<br> Oh... she fell in love with the islanders.<br> I was afraid that if we stayed there<br> much longer<br> I'd find her dancing in the moonlight<br> under the palm trees as naked as the rest.<br> Orin, don't be disgusting.<br> I wasn't as blind as I pretended to be.<br> You don't deny that Avahanni fell in love<br> with you, do you?<br> Stop talking like a fool.<br> What will Peter think?<br> He knows you're only teasing, but...<br> you shouldn't go on that way.<br> Why don't you go and find Hazel?<br> Here now, let me have a look at you.<br> Oh, don't stand like a ramrod.<br> You'd really be very handsome if you<br> shaved off that silly beard<br> and didn't carry yourself like a tin soldier.<br> Not so much like Father, eh?<br> More like a romantic clipper captain,<br> is that it?<br> That's enough of that.<br> Now run along and find Hazel.<br> She's probably waiting for you,<br> too shy to come and look for you.<br> You seem mighty anxious<br> to get rid of me.<br> What's come over him?<br> He's sick, Peter.<br> It's what the war did to him.<br> and Father's death and on top of that...<br> Mother's suicide.<br> It'll be all right, Vinnie.<br> Don't you worry.<br> Do you still love me?<br> I was afraid you didn't love me.<br> Oh, I do.<br> I've thought of you so much.<br> Things were always reminding me<br> of you.<br> The ship and the sea,<br> everything that was honest and clean.<br> Even the natives on the island.<br> Gosh, you certainly have changed.<br> But, say, what about that native<br> Orin talked about, that er...<br> what's his name?<br> Avahanni?<br> Yes.<br> He made me think of you, that's it.<br> He made me dream of marrying you<br> and everything.<br> Oh, I loved those islands.<br> They set me free.<br> There was something mysterious and<br> and beautiful there.<br> Good spirits coming out of the land<br> and the sea.<br> They made me forget death.<br> There was only this world,<br> the wind and the surf,<br> the natives dancing innocent and free.<br> Without knowledge of sin.<br> Oh, but I'm gabbing like a chatterbox.<br> I like you this way.<br> You never used to say a word<br> unless you had to.<br> Hold me close to you.<br> I want to feel love.<br> Love is all beautiful.<br> We'll be married soon, won't we?<br> And live out in the country<br> away from people and their evil talk.<br> We'll make an island for ourselves on land<br> and have children and love them<br> and teach them to love life so they'll<br> never be possessed by hate and death.<br> Oh, bless you, Peter.<br> I'm afraid we're not wanted, Orin.<br> So, that's your game, by God!<br> Well.<br> Don't look so solemn, fuss-buzzer.<br> I was only trying to scare you...<br> for a joke.<br> I suppose congratulations are in order.<br> The truth, the whole truth,<br> and nothing but the truth.<br> Is that what you're demanding, Father?<br> You sure you want the whole truth?<br> What will the neighbors say?<br> A ticklish decision for you,<br> Your Honor.<br> Orin.<br> Orin.<br> Orin, please open the door.<br> Why did you lock yourself in?<br> I was reading Father's law books.<br> He wanted me to take up law,<br> if you remember.<br> You've acted very strangely<br> these last few weeks.<br> Locking yourself in here with the<br> shutters closed.<br> And the lamp on, even in daytime.<br> I hate the daylight.<br> It's like an accusing eye.<br> We've renounced the day,<br> in which normal people live.<br> Or rather, it's renounced us.<br> Now you're being stupid again.<br> I find artificial light more appropriate<br> for my work.<br> Man's light. Not God's.<br> Man's feeble striving to understand<br> himself.<br> To exist for himself in the darkness.<br> It's a symbol of his life<br> A lamp burning out<br> in a room of waiting shadows.<br> Your work? What work?<br> Studying law of crime and punishment.<br> All right, if you won't tell me.<br> Oh, it's so close in here!<br> it's suffocating!<br> It's black as pitch tonight.<br> There isn't a star.<br> Darkness without a star<br> to guide us.<br> Where are we going, Vinnie?<br> Oh, I know you think<br> you know where you're going, but...<br> there's many a slip, remember?<br> Be quiet!<br> Can't you think of anything but...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm terribly nervous tonight.<br> I'm worried about you, Orin.<br> I'm thinking about your health.<br> I'm afraid there's not much hope<br> for you on that score.<br> I happen to feel quite well.<br> How can you insinuate such horrible...<br> But you're only trying to rile me.<br> And I'm not going to let you.<br> I'm glad you're feeling better.<br> The long walk we took with Hazel<br> must have done you good.<br> Why is it you never leave me<br> alone with her?<br> You wanted me to marry her.<br> Now we're engaged<br> you never leave us alone for a minute.<br> I know the reason.<br> You're afraid I'll let something slip.<br> Can you blame me,<br> the way you've been acting?<br> No.<br> I'm afraid myself.<br> I've no right in the same world<br> with her.<br> Yet, I feel myself drawn to her purity.<br> Her love makes me feel less vile<br> towards myself.<br> And yet at the same time<br> a million times more vile,<br> that's the torment.<br> She's another lost island now.<br> When I see love for a murderer<br> in her eyes<br> my guilt crowds up in my throat<br> like poisonous vomit<br> and I long to spit it out.<br> And confess.<br> That's what I live in terror of.<br> Were you hoping you could escape<br> retribution?<br> Confess and atone to the full extent<br> of the law.<br> That's the only way we can wash<br> the guilt of our mother's blood<br> from our souls.<br> Will you stop!<br> Ask our father, the judge.<br> He knows.<br> Over and over and over.<br> Will you never lose your stupid<br> guilty conscience?<br> How can you love that vile woman so?<br> When you know all she wanted<br> was to leave you without a thought<br> and marry that...<br> Yes! Exactly as you were planning<br> to leave me now and marry Peter.<br> I bet you'll stop your tricks<br> when you know what I've been writing.<br> What have you written?<br> That frightens you, does it?<br> I've got to know.<br> Well, I suppose I might as well tell you.<br> At his earnest solicitation,<br> as the last male Mannon -<br> thank heaven for that, eh! -<br> I've been writing the history<br> of our family.<br> What kind of history?<br> The true history of the family crimes.<br> Beginning with grandfather Abe,<br> all of the crimes including ours.<br> I've tried to trace to its secret<br> hiding place<br> the evil destiny behind our lives.<br> If I can find it clearly in our past,<br> I may be able to foretell<br> what fate is in store for us, Vinnie.<br> But I haven't dared predict that.<br> Not yet.<br> But I can guess.<br> Orin.<br> I found you the most interesting<br> criminal of us all.<br> How can you say such<br> dreadful things?<br> You know that behind all that pretense<br> about Mother's murder<br> being an act of justice was your<br> jealous hatred.<br> You wanted Brant for yourself.<br> That's a lie! I hated him.<br> After you found out he loved Mother,<br> yes.<br> But we'll let that pass<br> and come to what I've written<br> about your adventures on our lost islands.<br> Or should I say...<br> Adam Brant's islands.<br> Stop it! I warn you.<br> I won't bear it much longer.<br> Oh, what a paradise<br> the islands were for you, eh?<br> All those handsome men staring at you.<br> With your strange beautiful hair.<br> That was when you finally<br> became pretty.<br> Like Mother.<br> You knew that they all desired you,<br> didn't you?<br> They filled you with pride.<br> Especially Avahanni.<br> And you wanted him.<br> No!<br> Don't lie.<br> What did you do when you stepped away<br> with him that night when I was sick?<br> I kissed him good night, that's all.<br> In gratitude.<br> So you kissed him.<br> And that's all.<br> And what if it wasn't?<br> You vile, common...<br> I'll kill you and...<br> No, but you're lying, aren't you?<br> Tell me you're lying, Vinnie.<br> Yes, yes, it was a lie.<br> How could you believe I...<br> Oh, Orin.<br> Something made me tell you that<br> against my will.<br> Something rose up in me<br> like an evil spirit.<br> Ghosts.<br> You never seemed so much like Mother<br> as you did just then.<br> Oh, no, don't talk about it.<br> Let's forget it ever happened.<br> Forgive me.<br> Please forget it, Orin.<br> All right.<br> If the ghosts will let us forget.<br> I believe you about Avahanni.<br> But you were guilty in your mind<br> just the same.<br> Stop torturing me.<br> I've warned you. I warn you again.<br> I can't bear it much more.<br> I won't.<br> Then why don't you murder me?<br> I'd help you plan it just as we<br> planned Brant's<br> so there'd be no suspicion on you.<br> I loathe my life.<br> Orin!<br> Don't you see?<br> I'm now in Father's place.<br> You are Mother.<br> That's the evil destiny out of the past<br> that I hadn't dared predict.<br> I'm the Mannon you're chained to.<br> Won't you be quiet, for heaven's sake!<br> Take care, Orin.<br> You'll be responsible if...<br> If what?<br> If I should die mysteriously<br> of heart failure?<br> Leave me alone.<br> How can you be so horrible?<br> Don't you know I'm your sister<br> who loves you?<br> Who'd give her life to bring you<br> peace?<br> I don't believe you.<br> I know you're plotting something.<br> But I warn you. I won't stand<br> your leaving me for Peter.<br> And if I should die...<br> Oh, stop having such thoughts.<br> You're like a devil towards me.<br> I won't listen.<br> I won't.<br> Don't cry.<br> The damned don't cry.<br> Go away.<br> I want to be alone.<br> Finish my work.<br> Oh, why does he keep putting<br> his death in my head?<br> He'd be better off if he were dead.<br> Why hasn't he the courage to...<br> Don't let me have such thoughts.<br> You know I love Orin.<br> Show me the way to save him.<br> Please, please.<br> Vinnie! Oh, Vinnie!<br> Oh, Vinnie.<br> Yes?<br> That darned idiot of a cook<br> is throwing fits again.<br> Went down the cellar and said<br> she felt ghosts creeping behind her.<br> You better come and get her<br> calmed down<br> or she'll be leavin'.<br> I'll talk to her.<br> See who it is, Seth.<br> Ayeh.<br> Hazel, Peter.<br> Hello, Seth.<br> Is Vinnie here?<br> Ayeh.<br> You can just wait in the settin' room.<br> You set down and I'll tell her<br> you're here.<br> She'll come as soon as she kin.<br> I'll just say hello to Vinnie<br> then run along to the Council meeting.<br> I hate this house now.<br> Oh, sit down.<br> I hate coming here.<br> If it wasn't for Orin, I...<br> Why does Vinnie keep him<br> shut up here?<br> Oh, so that's what you've got<br> against her, huh?<br> Don't be silly.<br> I simply think and I'd say it to her face<br> that she's a bad influence for Orin.<br> He scares me at times.<br> And Vinnie...<br> I've watched her looking at you.<br> There's something bold about her.<br> Look, if you're going to talk<br> like that...<br> You ought to be ashamed, Hazel.<br> Well, I'm not.<br> And I'm going to make her let him<br> visit us.<br> Well, I think it's a darned good notion.<br> She needs a rest from him, too.<br> Vinnie doesn't think it's a good notion.<br> But I'm going to make Orin promise to...<br> to come over tomorrow<br> no matter what she says.<br> Don't get angry now over nothing.<br> I'll help you get your way with Vinnie.<br> Gosh, I'll do anything to help you<br> get Orin well.<br> As long as Vinnie's tied down to him<br> we can't get married.<br> Do you really want to marry her now?<br> Why do you ask such a fool question?<br> I don't know, Peter.<br> What in the dickens<br> is the matter with you, Hazel?<br> Here, what are you crying for?<br> Hello, Orin.<br> Where's Vinnie?<br> Seth went to call her.<br> I've got to talk to Hazel alone.<br> All right.<br> You don't have to put me out.<br> Tell Vinnie I had to go along,<br> but I'll come straight back.<br> I won't be long.<br> Listen, Hazel...<br> I want you to do something.<br> Take this.<br> Don't let her see it.<br> I want you to put it in a safe place<br> and never let anyone know you have it.<br> What is it, Orin?<br> You mustn't ask me.<br> And you must promise<br> never to open it<br> unless something happens to me.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, if I should die.<br> Orin.<br> Or, if she tries to marry Peter,<br> the day before the wedding<br> I want you to make Peter read<br> what's inside it.<br> You don't want her to marry Peter?<br> No.<br> She can't have happiness.<br> She's got to be punished.<br> And...<br> Hazel, you mustn't love me any more.<br> No! The only love I can know now<br> is the love of guilt for guilt.<br> Which breeds more guilt.<br> Until you get so deep in the bottom<br> of hell that...<br> there's no lower you can sink.<br> And you rest there in peace.<br> Orin, don't talk like that.<br> I know something's worrying you.<br> I've had such a strong feeling that...<br> it would relieve your mind<br> if you could tell me what it is.<br> Yes...<br> Yes, I want to be forgiven.<br> I want to confess.<br> No, I can't. Don't ask me.<br> Orin, Vinnie told Peter herself<br> what it is.<br> What did she tell?<br> About how you quarreled with<br> your poor mother the night before she...<br> and how you've brooded over it until...<br> you blame yourself for her death.<br> I see... So in case I did tell you...<br> Oh, she's cunning.<br> But not cunning enough this time.<br> Remember what I gave you<br> and do exactly what I said with it.<br> Oh, Hazel...<br> If you love me help me get away<br> from here<br> or something terrible will happen.<br> That's just what I want to do.<br> You come over tomorrow<br> and stay with us.<br> Do you suppose for a moment<br> she'd ever let me go?<br> Haven't you a right to do<br> as you want to?<br> Yes.<br> I could sneak out when she wasn't watching...<br> and then you can hide me and when<br> she comes for me<br> you tell her I'm not there.<br> I won't do any such thing.<br> I don't tell lies, Orin.<br> You better get out of here.<br> Don't let anyone see<br> what I have given you.<br> Go home and lock it up.<br> Oh, how can you be so scared<br> of Vinnie?<br> Shhh.<br> Where's Peter?<br> Seth said he was here with you.<br> He had to go to a Council meeting.<br> He'll be right back.<br> Has he been gone long?<br> Not very long.<br> My, but you two look mysterious.<br> Why, Vinnie, what makes you think...<br> You're hiding something.<br> Hazel's invited me over to their house.<br> And I'm going.<br> He's coming tomorrow.<br> It's kind of you.<br> But he can't go.<br> Why not?<br> I don't wish to discuss it.<br> Orin's of age.<br> He can go where he pleases.<br> I'll ask you to please mind<br> your own business.<br> It is my business. I love Orin.<br> I don't think you love him at all<br> the way you've been acting.<br> Hazel, you said you ought<br> to go home.<br> I think you'd better go now<br> and leave me<br> to fight this out with Vinnie.<br> All right, Orin.<br> We'll expect you tomorrow<br> and have your room ready.<br> After the way you've insulted me,<br> Vinnie,<br> I hope you realize there's no longer<br> any question of friendship between us.<br> What are you hiding behind your back?<br> Have you given her what you've written?<br> Answer me.<br> What if I have?<br> You traitor, you coward.<br> Give it to me. Do you hear?<br> Vinnie, how dare you speak to me<br> that way!<br> You shan't leave this house<br> until you...<br> Orin, think what you're doing.<br> Tell her to give it to me.<br> No.<br> Think sanely for a moment. You can't do this.<br> You're a Mannon.<br> It's because I am one.<br> For Mother's sake, you can't!<br> You loved her.<br> A lot she cared. Don't call on her.<br> For my sake, Orin.<br> You know I love you.<br> Make Hazel give it up and<br> I'll do anything.<br> Anything you want me to.<br> Do you really mean that?<br> Yes.<br> Give it to me, Hazel.<br> I suppose we can't expect you<br> tomorrow now.<br> No. Forget me.<br> The Orin you loved was killed<br> in the war.<br> Remember him, not his rotting ghost.<br> Goodbye.<br> Please go.<br> Do you realize the promise you made<br> means giving up Peter?<br> Yes.<br> And never seeing him again?<br> Yes.<br> But how will I make you keep<br> a promise that I forced out of you?<br> Oh, I know you, Vinnie.<br> You'll always be plotting<br> how to break it.<br> The only thing in your way now<br> is my life.<br> Orin, don't talk like that.<br> You'd do anything now<br> to get rid of me.<br> I said I knew you, but...<br> do I?<br> There are times when you no longer<br> seem to be my sister at all.<br> Or Mother, but...<br> some stranger.<br> with the same beautiful hair.<br> Perhaps you're Marie Brantme.<br> And you say there are no ghosts in this house.<br> Orin!<br> You're insane.<br> Vinnie, there's only one way out<br> of this hell.<br> Let's go now and confess and pay the penalty<br> and find peace together.<br> Please.<br> No, you coward!<br> There's nothing to confess.<br> There was only justice.<br> You hear her?<br> You'll find Lavinia Mannon harder<br> to break than me.<br> You'll have to haunt her<br> and hound her for a lifetime.<br> I hate you!<br> I wish you were dead!<br> You have no right to live.<br> You'd kill yourself if you weren't<br> a coward.<br> Vinnie!<br> I mean it! I mean it!<br> You mean it.<br> Another act of justice, eh?<br> Only it would be justice now.<br> You're Mother.<br> Yes, she's speaking now,<br> through you.<br> Yes, it's the way to find my island.<br> My lost island.<br> Death is an island of peace, too.<br> Mother will be waiting for me.<br> Mother, you know what I'll do.<br> I'll go down on my kness and...<br> ask your forgiveness and say...<br> I'll say...<br> I'm glad you found love, Mother.<br> I'll wish you happiness.<br> You and...<br> and Adam.<br> Mother.<br> No, Orin!<br> Get out of my way, can't you?<br> Mother's waiting.<br> Orin!<br> That's Peter. Shut up, now.<br> Hello, Orin.<br> Hello, Peter.<br> Vinnie's just had a quarrel with Hazel.<br> She's all upset.<br> That sister of mine. Where is she?<br> Gone home.<br> Vinnie, don't you pay any attention<br> to her.<br> You take her in there and comfort her.<br> I'll go into the study and clean<br> my pistol.<br> Glad you came back, Peter.<br> You can keep Vinnie company.<br> Orin!<br> Orin!<br> He's a darned fool<br> to monkey with a pistol in his state.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Peter!<br> Hold me close to you.<br> Nothing matters but love, does it?<br> No price is too big, is it?<br> Oh, I must have peace.<br> No one has the right to keep anyone<br> from peace.<br> Shouldn't I get that pistol<br> away from him?<br> Oh, won't it be wonderful?<br> Once we're married, together in our home<br> away from here?<br> Oh, we'll be so happy.<br> I want to be happy, Peter.<br> I love everything that grows simply.<br> Up toward the sun,<br> everything that's straight and strong.<br> I hate what's dark and warped<br> and eats into itself and dies for a lifetime<br> in darkness.<br> I can't bear waiting and waiting<br> and waiting...<br> Orin.<br> Orin!<br> Orin!<br> I'll break in through the window.<br> Orin...<br> forgive me.<br> Why do you look at me like that?<br> Wasn't it the only way to keep<br> your secret?<br> I'm through with you forever now.<br> I'm Mother's daughter,<br> not one of you.<br> I'll live in spite of you!<br> Vinnie, did you see?<br> Seth.<br> Ayeh?<br> Take these and put them inside.<br> I want the house to be filled<br> with flowers.<br> Oh, Vinnie, I, uh...<br> I seed you settin' out here on the steps<br> when I got up at five this mornin'<br> and every mornin' since Orin...<br> Ain't you gettin' no sleep?<br> How'd you like if I was to haul one of them<br> sofas out here for you to lay down on?<br> I'm waiting for Peter.<br> Why didn't you tell me to go<br> in the house and lie down?<br> You understand, don't you?<br> You know there's no rest in this house<br> that Grandfather<br> built as a temple of Hate and Death!<br> Don't you try to live here, Vinnie!<br> You marry Peter and git clear!<br> I'm going to marry him.<br> And I'm going away with him<br> and forget this house<br> and everything that's happened here!<br> That's talking, Vinnie.<br> I'll close it up and leave it in the sun<br> and rain to die.<br> The Mannons will be forgotten.<br> I'm the last and won't be one for long.<br> I'll be Mrs Peter Niles.<br> Then they're finished.<br> Thank heaven.<br> Oh, Vinnie.<br> Here's Hazel coming.<br> It won't take me long to say<br> what I've come to say, Vinnie.<br> It's a lie about Orin<br> killing himself by accident! I know it is!<br> I should think you'd be the last one<br> to accuse Orin...<br> I'm not accusing Orin.<br> I'm accusing you.<br> You drove him to it.<br> What would Orin think of you coming here<br> on the day of his funeral<br> to accuse me of the sorrow<br> that's afflicted our family?<br> All right, Vinnie.<br> I won't say anything more.<br> But I know there's something<br> - and so do you -<br> something that was driving Orin crazy.<br> Poor Orin.<br> Don't do that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't come to talk about Orin.<br> What did you come for?<br> About Peter.<br> You leave Peter and me alone.<br> You're not going to marry Peter<br> and ruin his life, you can't!<br> Don't you see you'll only drag him<br> into this terrible thing, whatever it is?<br> There is no terrible thing.<br> Oh, Vinnie, you've got to be fair<br> to Peter.<br> You've got to consider his happiness,<br> if you really love him!<br> I do love him.<br> He fought with Mother last night.<br> The first time he ever did<br> such a thing.<br> He left home and went to the hotel.<br> He said he'd never speak to Mother<br> or me again.<br> You've changed him.<br> We've always been so happy before.<br> It's broken Mother's heart.<br> All she does is sit and cry.<br> Oh, Vinnie, you can't do it!<br> You will be punished if you do!<br> Peter will get to hate you in the end!<br> No!<br> Do you want to drive him to do<br> what Orin did?<br> He might, if he ever discovered the truth!<br> What truth, you little fool?<br> I don't know, but you know.<br> Look in your heart and ask your conscience<br> before God if you ought to marry Peter!<br> Yes, before God, before anything.<br> You leave me alone. Go away<br> or I'll get Orin's pistol and kill you!<br> You are wicked.<br> I believe you would.<br> Vinnie, what's made you like this?<br> Go away.<br> All right, I'll go.<br> But remember one thing.<br> You owe it to Peter to let him read<br> what Orin wrote in that envelope.<br> Orin asked me to make him read it<br> before he married you.<br> I've told Peter about that,<br> Vinnie.<br> I know you're suffering.<br> And I know your conscience<br> will make you do what's right.<br> And God will forgive you.<br> I'm not asking God or anyone<br> to forgive me.<br> I forgive myself.<br> Oh, I hope there's a hell for the<br> good somewhere.<br> The dead... why can't the dead die?<br> Vinnie.<br> Sit down, Peter.<br> Vinnie, you look so terribly worn.<br> Haven't you slept?<br> We'll be married soon.<br> The first thing is to get you away<br> from this house.<br> Yes.<br> Love can't live in it.<br> We'll go away and leave it alone<br> to die.<br> And we'll forget the dead.<br> We can't move too far away<br> to suit me!<br> I hate this town now and everyone<br> in it.<br> I never heard you talk<br> that way before.<br> So bitter.<br> Some things would make anyone bitter!<br> You've quarrelled with your mother<br> and Hazel on account of me.<br> How did you know that?<br> Hazel was just here.<br> The darned little fool!<br> What did she have to tell you that for?<br> She doesn't want me to marry you.<br> The little sneak! What right has she...?<br> You won't pay any attention<br> to her, I hope.<br> No, no.<br> She and Mother suddenly got a lot of<br> crazy notions. But they'll get over them.<br> If they don't,<br> I'm through with both of them.<br> Peter.<br> Let me look at you.<br> Are you beginning to suspect me?<br> Are you wondering what it was<br> Orin wrote?<br> Of course not. Don't I know Orin<br> was out of his mind?<br> You swear you'll never suspect me<br> of anything?<br> What do you think I am?<br> Nothing can keep us from being happy,<br> can it? You won't let it, will you?<br> Of course I won't.<br> Now I'm glad I destroyed<br> what Orin wrote.<br> You destroyed it?<br> I burned the envelope, yes...<br> Oh, Peter. I want to get married<br> right away. I'm afraid.<br> Would you marry me now, this evening?<br> Marry me today, Peter.<br> I'm afraid to wait.<br> But, Vinnie, we can't.<br> It...<br> It wouldn't look right<br> on the same day that Orin was...<br> Out of respect for him...<br> I don't see why you're so afraid to wait.<br> Nothing can happen, can it?<br> Was there anything in what Orin wrote<br> that would stop us?<br> The dead coming between...<br> They always would, Peter.<br> You trust me with your happiness!<br> But that means trusting the Mannon dead,<br> and they're not to be trusted with love!<br> I couldn't bear to watch your eyes grow bitter<br> and hidden from me the way they are now.<br> Wounded in their trust of life.<br> I love you too much!<br> What are you talking about, Vinnie?<br> Why did you burn that envelope?<br> You make me think there was something...<br> No, nothing. No!<br> Don't think of that, not yet.<br> I want a little happiness.<br> I've earned it, I've done enough.<br> Listen, Peter.<br> Can't you be strong?<br> Can't you be simple and pure? Can't you<br> forget sin and see that all love is beautiful?<br> Oh, hold me close.<br> Want me so much you'd murder anyone<br> to have me.<br> Our love will drive the dead away.<br> It will shame them back into death.<br> Oh, love me, Adam...<br> Adam!<br> Oh, why did I call you Adam?<br> I never heard that name before,<br> outside of the Bible.<br> Always the dead between.<br> Vinnie! You're talking crazy! You don't<br> know what you're saying!<br> I can't marry you, Peter.<br> There's no use trying any more.<br> You mustn't ever see me again.<br> Go home.<br> Make it up with your mother and sister.<br> Marry someone else.<br> I can't have love.<br> Vinnie! What's changed you like this?<br> Is it what Orin wrote?<br> What was it?<br> I've got a right to know, haven't I?<br> He acted so queer when he talked<br> about the islands.<br> Was it something to do with that native,<br> that Avahanni?<br> Peter!<br> All right. If you must know.<br> It was Avahanni.<br> Oh, no, Vinnie. You couldn't.<br> I don't believe you.<br> Why shouldn't I?<br> I wanted to learn love.<br> Love that wasn't a sin.<br> I did, I tell you.<br> Mother and Hazel were right about you.<br> You are bad at heart.<br> No wonder Orin killed himself.<br> I hope you'll be punished.<br> I...<br> Peter!<br> It's a lie. I didn't.<br> Goodbye, Peter.<br> "Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you<br> Way-ay, my rolling river<br> Oh, Shenandoah, I can't get near you<br> Way-ay, I'm bound away<br> I'm not bound away.<br> Not now, Seth.<br> I'm bound here.<br> To the Mannon dead.<br> Vinnie!<br> Don't go in there, Vinnie!<br> Don't be afraid.<br> I'm not going the way Mother<br> and Orin went.<br> I'll never go out or see anyone!<br> I'll live alone with the dead<br> and keep their secrets.<br> And let them hound me till<br> the curse is paid out<br> and the last Mannon is let die!<br> I know they'll see to it<br> that I live for a long time.<br> It takes the Mannons to punish themselves<br> for being born!<br> Ayeh.<br> And I ain't heard a word<br> you've been sayin'.<br> You go now and close the shutters.<br> And nail them tight.<br> Ayeh.<br> And throw out all the flowers.<br> Ayeh.<br>
