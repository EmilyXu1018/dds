Excellent.<br> - Albert Victor.<br> "Eddie" for short.<br> - What do you think?<br> - A fine choice, sir.<br> Excellent.<br> How many?<br> The royal family and senior members<br> of the household, ma'am.<br> - Just those?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> [Bell Chiming]<br> [Silverware Clinking]<br> [Clock Ticking]<br> [Clearing Throat]<br> We're expecting Brown<br> this afternoon, ma'am.<br> Whom?<br> That's a very pretty shawl<br> you're wearing, Alex.<br> The colour suits you well.<br> But you're not eating enough.<br> One must not let vanity<br> overrule one's appetite.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> [Horses Whinnying In Stable]<br> We were due at a quarter<br> past 1:00. You're late.<br> Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House<br> is not as you will remember it.<br> The household remains<br> in full mourning,<br> and no one is permitted to raise their<br> voice under any circumstance whatsoever.<br> The Queen breakfasts at 9:30,<br> lunches at 2:00,<br> takes tea at 5:30<br> and dinner at 8:45.<br> No one's allowed to leave the building<br> while the Queen is at home.<br> On rare occasions when she's out,<br> you may ask permission to leave,<br> but only<br> with my consent.<br> You're to be ready to walk the pony<br> at any time after 10:00.<br> You'll clean the Queen's<br> outdoor things...<br> and do any odd jobs<br> as and when she requires.<br> How will I know?<br> I'm sorry?<br> - How will I know<br> what the Queen requires?<br> - You'll be sent a message.<br> - And who will bring it to me?<br> - Her Highness's equerry.<br> I'll need a man<br> who knows where I am.<br> - Oh, I don't think it'd be<br> difficult to find you.<br> - That's not good enough.<br> - Then we'll have to see<br> what can be arranged.<br> - Aye. Do.<br> As I'm sure you'll remember<br> from Balmoral,<br> you do not speak<br> while in Her Majesty's presence,<br> unless Her Majesty<br> addresses you directly.<br> Mr Brown, ma'am.<br> Mr Brown is here, ma'am.<br> - Mr Brown.<br> - Ma'am.<br> - You're here safely?<br> - Aye, ma'am.<br> - You are well?<br> - I am.<br> - And the pony?<br> - She's well too.<br> Your family sent cards.<br> It was much appreciated.<br> I'm glad of it.<br> My husband was always very complimentary<br> in speaking of you.<br> He would have approved, I'm sure,<br> of my calling on you in this way.<br> I trust it does not<br> inconvenience you too much.<br> I have no family, ma'am.<br> Only my brothers and sisters.<br> Yes.<br> You have a brother<br> in service here, do you not?<br> - I forget his name.<br> - Archie.<br> Yes.<br> That will be company<br> for you.<br> Yes.<br> [Gasps]<br> Honest to God, I never thought<br> to see you in such a state.<br> You must miss him<br> dreadfully.<br> You do not...<br> He...<br> Get him out!<br> Get him out of here!<br> Get him out!<br> Get him out!<br> So, the day they arrived,<br> she greets the sultan and<br> his family with barely a word<br> and retires to her chamber.<br> Now, the sultan, he's not used to<br> state occasions without a head of state,<br> and he's standing in the lobby waiting<br> for someone to tell him what to do.<br> But the court<br> is under strict instructions<br> not to talk in the corridor,<br> so nobody speaks to him, not<br> a living soul, for the whole afternoon.<br> So now it's dinner,<br> and everyone's standing around<br> the table, still not a word,<br> waiting for Her Majesty<br> to arrive.<br> One hour goes by, two.<br> The sultan is getting a wee<br> bit peckish, to say the least.<br> Finally, his wee laddie<br> breaks for the cold meats<br> and stuffs a slice in his mouth.<br> Oh, the uproar<br> when she heard.<br> - You'd have thought somebody<br> had stolen the crown jewels.<br> - So?<br> [Sighing] So there are rules.<br> Things you do and don't do.<br> All I did was tell the woman<br> how I feel, for God's sake.<br> - You don't tell Her Majesty<br> how you feel.<br> - I speak as I find, Archie.<br> Not down south you don't.<br> - So, what did Ponsonby do<br> when she started shouting?<br> - [Slams Drawer Shut]<br> [Sighing]<br> I thought he nearly ruptured his truss.<br> Prince Leopold? Now isn't he the one<br> who sits around bleedin' all day?<br> So what does his valet do?<br> Bring out his bandages for him?<br> It's better than<br> shovelling horseshit.<br> Now, if it's promotion<br> you're after,<br> you should've picked<br> one of the healthier ones.<br> She's hardly<br> a full hamper herself.<br> It's only grief that's<br> made her that way.<br> Three years, John? Is that not<br> a bit long to be grieving?<br> - She loved him.<br> - Come on, man.<br> - There's love. Then there's...<br> - What?<br> - [Pitcher Thuds]<br> - You know what I mean.<br> I don't think I do, Archie.<br> There's love, and there's<br> behaving like you do...<br> because there's nobody<br> to tell you not to.<br> So, which one of us<br> was she flirtin' with?<br> The good-looking one.<br> Obviously doesn't have<br> enough to do.<br> You work the system right,<br> you could ask her yourself.<br> Just be thankful you're not working<br> for the household.<br> The Queen never lets them<br> out of her sight.<br> But wee spats like us can slip<br> through the net easy.<br> I'm no wee spat, Archie.<br> [Laughing]<br> [Maid]<br> Don't just stare at him.<br> [Neighing]<br> Who is that?<br> - It's Mr Brown, ma'am.<br> - What is he doing there?<br> He appears to be standing<br> by his horse, ma'am.<br> I made no request<br> to go out riding today.<br> How long<br> has he been there?<br> I don't know, ma'am.<br> He was observed earlier, I believe.<br> Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing<br> in the courtyard.<br> - I've no wish to go riding.<br> - I'm very sorry, ma'am.<br> I can't imagine...<br> He was certainly given<br> no instructions.<br> Please make sure<br> it does not happen again.<br> Of course. At once.<br> - What on Earth did you think<br> you were doing?<br> - Awaiting my orders.<br> You do not report for duty<br> unless the Queen requests of it.<br> You know that very well.<br> I didn't come all this way<br> to sit on my arse.<br> You'll await your orders<br> like everyone else...<br> unless you prefer a repeat<br> of yesterday's little excitement.<br> No.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I thought I made myself<br> perfectly clear.<br> You do not leave your room<br> until Her Majesty requests it.<br> You tell Her Majesty<br> from me...<br> if her husband was here today,<br> he'd have her outta the house...<br> and gettin'<br> some air into her.<br> What the hell's the point<br> of me bein' here otherwise?<br> Go inside at once.<br> Is that the Queen's request?<br> Yes. It most certainly is.<br> [Clicks Tongue]<br> - [Horse Neighing, Whinnying]<br> - Mr Brown?<br> Yes, ma'am?<br> You have been told repeatedly<br> not to stand in the courtyard...<br> unless requested to do so.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Then why do you persist<br> in doing it?<br> Because I believe<br> Her Majesty's wrong.<br> If ever a poor soul<br> needed some fresh air, it's her.<br> The Queen will ride out<br> if and when she chooses.<br> And I intend to be there<br> when she's ready.<br> Prince Albert was going<br> to build a bench here.<br> He thought it one<br> of the best views in Osborne.<br> Aye, it's a fine spot, ma'am.<br> He thought so, yes.<br> In everything I do<br> and everything I say,<br> I try to think<br> as much as possible...<br> what he would do or say<br> if he were here now.<br> My private secretary wishes me<br> to return to public duties.<br> If Prince Albert was here,<br> he'd tell him a thing or two.<br> Sir Henry's not alone.<br> They all wish it.<br> The same people who refused to grant<br> my husband the title of "King"...<br> because he was deemed<br> of insufficient rank.<br> I have some letters in my saddlebag.<br> I'd like to read them.<br> I cannot read them<br> like that.<br> You will hand them to me<br> as I require.<br> [Chattering]<br> [Chattering Stops]<br> Mr Carter, the head butler,<br> sits there.<br> Not any more he doesn't.<br> This is my place.<br> - By whose authority?<br> - My own.<br> The order of seating<br> at the upper servants' table...<br> is arranged personally<br> by the Queen herself.<br> Now that's a tautology, lad.<br> If you say the Queen<br> has arranged something,<br> there's no need to say<br> she's done it personally.<br> It's understood.<br> - [Murmuring]<br> - [Man] Thank you.<br> And you're the Queen's dresser,<br> I believe.<br> Assistant, sir. Yes.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Mary Taylor, sir.<br> Have I seen you<br> up at Balmoral, Mary?<br> I hope to go up next year.<br> Tell me, Mary. What is the Queen<br> reading for recreation these days?<br> Lord Tennyson, sir.<br> [Murmuring Stops]<br> Ah!<br> Am I the only one eating?<br> Lord Clarendon arrives<br> by invitation at 11:00,<br> followed at 12:00 by a picnic<br> on the grounds to celebrate<br> Princess Alice's birthday.<br> The chancellor writes to say<br> that by happy coincidence,<br> he will be in Cowes<br> this weekend,<br> and he asks if Your Majesty<br> might grant him an audience.<br> Why?<br> He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty<br> might wish to be informed...<br> of the latest developments<br> in government.<br> No, I shall be out walking.<br> Then, perhaps, Your Majesty<br> might consider it opportune...<br> if the Prince of Wales<br> were to meet him on your behalf.<br> On no account.<br> Mama, I really do think it's time<br> we made ourselves a little more...<br> [Clears Throat]<br> available.<br> I think<br> we must accept...<br> that our position in the country<br> is not entirely unrelated...<br> to the continued absence<br> of the monarchy from public life.<br> I thought, perhaps, we might consider<br> a small gesture of some kind.<br> - Gesture?<br> - I thought a dinner<br> for our ambassadors, perhaps.<br> No dinners, Bertie.<br> Why are you dressed for outdoors?<br> - It's so infernally cold in here.<br> - Cold is good.<br> Is that not so,<br> Dr Jenner?<br> [Gasping]<br> Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.<br> - Cold is good!<br> - Oh, excellent, ma'am. Excellent.<br> But perhaps if Her Majesty...<br> were to consider accompanying<br> her newfound physical vigour...<br> with the benefits<br> of mental activity.<br> Why am I being lectured<br> in this way?<br> - Oh, forgive me, Your Majesty.<br> - I will not tolerate<br> anybody lecturing me...<br> - about the responsibility of monarchy.<br> - Mother.<br> Least of all my son!<br> It was his irresponsibility<br> that drove my husband to his grave!<br> If it is inconvenient<br> to Her Majesty,<br> then perhaps she might consider<br> allowing the Prince of Wales...<br> Would you believe they sent me<br> so many boxes to taunt me?<br> Dr Jenner writes that my nerves are<br> in an extremely fragile state,<br> and yet they continue to<br> hound me with box after box...<br> after box after box<br> after box.<br> [Sighing]<br> I wish to take the princesses<br> for a swim.<br> The turns I have been taking<br> in the grounds have proved<br> most beneficial to me,<br> and Brown thinks saltwater<br> will do me good.<br> Don't putter, children. Swim!<br> You could buy that lot<br> for garden ornaments...<br> and still get change<br> from ten guineas.<br> Lift your foot, woman!<br> [Brown] Walk on.<br> [Clicks Tongue]<br> [Man]<br> This nation is fortunate...<br> insomuch as it is not governed<br> by force...<br> but by a chain of traditions...<br> that have been cherished<br> from generation to generation.<br> Because in them...<br> in our traditions...<br> are embodied all the laws that have<br> enabled us to create...<br> the greatest empire<br> of modern time!<br> [Cheering]<br> And even though<br> we have amassed great capital,<br> and even though<br> we have established an industry...<br> with no parallel<br> in the world.<br> Yet all these<br> mighty creations...<br> are as nothing...<br> compared to<br> the invisible customs...<br> which shape our lives.<br> [Cheering]<br> To those honourable gentlemen of<br> the opposition that seek to destroy...<br> the essential elements<br> of this country...<br> I say,<br> let them remember...<br> England cannot begin again!<br> [Shouting]<br> Have you seen this?<br> Should we<br> take it seriously?<br> - The cartoon,<br> or Her Majesty's absenteeism?<br> - Well, both.<br> The question is:<br> Do we need her?<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Too kind. Thank you so much.<br> Thank you.<br> Surely you're not suggesting<br> we dispense with the Constitution?<br> My dear Stanley, a prime minister<br> with only a handful of friends...<br> must respect<br> public opinion.<br> - Congratulations, Prime Minister.<br> - Thank you.<br> Gossip counts.<br> Lord Aberdeen was right.<br> This country is not governed<br> by wisdom but by talk.<br> Oh, granted,<br> it wouldn't take too much...<br> to winkle the old girl<br> out of mourning,<br> but if public opinion<br> is against her,<br> it doesn't do<br> to appear too close.<br> - So?<br> - We'll see which way the wind blows.<br> [Whooping]<br> [Shouting]<br> My heart's<br> in the Highlands!<br> My heart is not here!<br> My heart's in the Highlands,<br> chasing the deer!<br> One box of biscuits, one box<br> of drop tablets. one box of pralines,<br> It's the same order every week. Does one<br> of them even bother to check it?<br> The woman's goin'<br> to Balmoral tomorrow...<br> without the one wee luxury<br> she actually enjoys.<br> Look, someone'll<br> send it on ahead.<br> Oh, aye,<br> but will they?<br> It's not your problem,<br> what she eats, John.<br> The woman's surrounded<br> by fools.<br> She's supposed to be packed,<br> dressed and ready...<br> tomorrow mornin',<br> half past 7:00.<br> If it's up to any of them, she'll<br> still be gettin' dressed at 8:00.<br> She's got an army of people<br> to get her up and out.<br> But I'm the only one<br> she trusts.<br> She'll blow hot and cold on you,<br> John.

What about John Brown?<br> I told ya.<br> I serve my Queen.<br> And no other aspiration?<br> To see her safe.<br> You will not be unaware...<br> of the threat now posed<br> by the republicanism?<br> Why do you think<br> I've kept her here?<br> Ah, but therein lies<br> the paradox.<br> It is her very isolation<br> that encourages the malcontents.<br> The longer she is away,<br> the stronger they become,<br> and who, honestly, can provide<br> security against that?<br> However many doors<br> you lock,<br> someone will always get in.<br> Even here.<br> So?<br> The truth is, the Queen<br> would be safer...<br> doing her duty and returning<br> south to her public.<br> John Bull loves her,<br> and John Bull is her best defence.<br> Her mind is set.<br> You'll never change it now.<br> She trusts you, John.<br> [Sighing]<br> They don't see it.<br> See what?<br> The danger. I keep tellin' them,<br> but they don't see it.<br> - They're not as watchful as you.<br> - They're too busy<br> thinking about themselves.<br> A greasy pole.<br> - No loyalty.<br> - No, um,<br> Iove.<br> I promised to protect her...<br> from people like you.<br> [Chuckling]<br> For once in my life, I'm not the issue.<br> - She'll never understand it.<br> - Oh, in time she will.<br> She'll think<br> I've betrayed her.<br> But others will know that you<br> acted for the greater good.<br> I received a letter today<br> from Mr Disraeli.<br> Parliament are calling<br> for my return to public duties.<br> He insists the country<br> expects me to preside...<br> over the opening<br> of the new session.<br> I refuse to offer sustenance<br> to enable his weakening grip.<br> Besides, you know how much<br> I would hate it.<br> It frightens me.<br> John?<br> We can't always have<br> what we wish.<br> "Duty"?<br> You talk about "duty"?<br> When duty and safety are served<br> by the same ends, then, aye, I do!<br> I cannot believe you're saying this.<br> You who I've relied on all this time?<br> - Have I ever lied before?<br> - You stand there and tell me<br> it is my duty!<br> - After all you promised me?<br> - I've broken no promise!<br> You're forcing me to do<br> the very thing you know I'd fear most.<br> For God's sake, woman,<br> I'm tryin' to see you safe!<br> I will not hear any more<br> about my safety!<br> You made me a promise,<br> and now you've broken it!<br> When I took you out riding,<br> come rain or shine,<br> because I knew<br> it was right for you,<br> when I got the bairns off your back<br> just to give you a bit o' peace,<br> when I saw you safe<br> from home to home when<br> you didn't even know if I was there,<br> all I ever thought about<br> was you!<br> - Then why send me back to them?<br> - Because I have to!<br> Will you not listen to me,<br> woman?<br> Do not presume to talk<br> to your Queen in that manner.<br> Dr Jenner,<br> I feel unwell.<br> I shall retire<br> to my chamber.<br> - Please attend me presently.<br> - Ma'am.<br> [All]<br> Ma'am.<br> May I say how glad I am to see<br> Your Majesty so much recovered.<br> Where is my son?<br> Prince Albert<br> is at Windsor, ma'am.<br> Why is he not here?<br> - He is sick, ma'am.<br> - Then why are you not with him?<br> You ordered all members of the royal<br> family to attend you at Balmoral.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> He has typhoid fever, ma'am.<br> No. You are mistaken.<br> Prince Albert, my husband,<br> had typhoid fever.<br> I asked what was wrong<br> with my son.<br> The same, Your Majesty.<br> Why was I not informed?<br> I did not consider it wise<br> in the circumstances...<br> to tax your nerves.<br> How ill is he?<br> Alex?<br> He is not well, ma'am.<br> I must go to him.<br> We must leave at once.<br> [Chattering]<br> [Chattering]<br> [Watch Ticking]<br> Better.<br> If the Good Lord should see fit<br> to spare my son,<br> I will order a Mass<br> to be celebrated at St. George's.<br> The people must share<br> with their Queen...<br> her prayers and hopes<br> for their future King.<br> The Queen will be riding<br> to St. George's on the 5th.<br> I recommend Her Majesty use a covered<br> carriage and a full horse guard.<br> In the event of any disturbance,<br> I will insure...<br> I will ride to St. George's<br> in an open carriage.<br> It is time the Queen<br> was seen by her public.<br> [People Cheering]<br> [Cheering]<br> No!<br> [Albert]<br> And so there he is, Arthur O'Conner,<br> all seven stone of the man,<br> paddling madly towards us<br> through a sea of horse guards,<br> waving something that<br> looks vaguely like a pen!<br> - [Laughing]<br> - I thought he must be one of<br> Mother's ardent readership...<br> in search of<br> the royal indenture.<br> [Laughter]<br> I believe I saw him first,<br> and then I alerted Brown.<br> I'm not convinced that he wasn't<br> taking a snooze on top of the steps.<br> - [Laughing]<br> - So we had our man pinned down,<br> and I must say that Brown<br> acquitted himself admirably.<br> Of course, the gun<br> turned out to be a fake,<br> but, uh, well, you know,<br> nonetheless it was, um...<br> [Clears Throat]<br> - Yes, um, well done.<br> - [Guests Murmur In Agreement]<br> I intend Brown to be rewarded<br> with a special medal cast in gold.<br> It will be called<br> the "Devoted Service Medal."<br> - [Albert] Mm.<br> - [Applause]<br> [Clinking]<br> A toast.<br> [Albert]<br> Victoria Regina!<br> [Guests]<br> Victoria Regina!<br> I saw your face there<br> as well, Sir Henry.<br> I think that you were sneaking<br> a bit behind the carriage.<br> [Albert Continues Talking,<br> Indistinct]<br> [Guests Talking,<br> Laughing]<br> [Disraeli]<br> The people of England have expressed,<br> in a manner which<br> cannot be mistaken,<br> that they will uphold<br> the ancient monarchy of England.<br> Go to your homes.<br> Teach them these truths.<br> A land of liberty,<br> of prosperity...<br> of power...<br> and of glory!<br> [Cheering]<br> [Brown] We should not live<br> in expectation of contentment.<br> Fifteen years of vigilance<br> will not guarantee peace of mind.<br> Yesterday, intruders were again<br> reported in the south wing.<br> I believe my prompt arrival<br> may have averted any crisis,<br> but it was<br> a timely reminder.<br> It is a great comfort to me<br> that my efforts...<br> in securing the Queen's safety<br> over the years have not been in vain.<br> Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word<br> that she is dissatisfied,<br> and I feel sure that<br> if she were unhappy,<br> she would have found the occasion<br> to speak to me in person,<br> - [Clattering]<br> - as she has so often done in the past.<br> - [Knocking]<br> - What is it?<br> [Man]<br> North woods, sir!<br> [Thunderclap]<br> God save the Queen!<br> [Gunshot Echoing]<br> How long has he been<br> this sick?<br> A few days, ma'am.<br> Why was I not told earlier?<br> [Knocking]<br> You should never have gone out<br> in such foul weather.<br> Someone has to look after ya.<br> It could have been someone.<br> It was before.<br> Yes. Yes, it was.<br> My ministers are<br> as impertinent as ever.<br> Dispatches so numerous<br> they come in a trunk.<br> Sometimes, I do believe,<br> they will never stop.<br> Endless letters.<br> I know I've not always been...<br> the loyal friend<br> that you deserve, John.<br> And here, even now, I'm...<br> feeling desperate<br> with the thought of losing you.<br> Don't be silly, woman.<br> [Gasping]<br> [Water Splashing]<br> [Sniffling]<br> Not too near.<br> [Sobbing]<br> [Dr Jenner]<br> Cause of death was pneumonia.<br> [Sir Henry]<br> Not too protracted, I hope.<br> A few days.<br> When he heard,<br> the Prince of Wales...<br> threw the bust over the wall<br> of the north tower.<br> Took four hours<br> to gather the fragments.<br> Queen wishes to publish<br> an account of him.<br> Dear, oh, dear.<br> - We think she can be dissuaded.<br> - Hmm.<br> Have you had a glance<br> at the diary?<br> - Yes.<br> - Quite.<br> I think I best<br> take it back.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Where did you find it,<br> by the way?<br> Oh, some young page was boasting<br> about having seen it.<br> - Lucky.<br> - [Chuckles]<br> Well, no rest<br> for the wicked, Henry.<br> No. Indeed.<br>
