                        For as much as it has pleased<br> Almighty God of his great mercy,<br> to take unto himself the soul<br> of our dear brother here departed...<br> ...we therefore commit his body<br> to the ground...<br> ...earth to earth,<br> ashes to ashes...<br> ...dust to dust.<br> So sorry, my dear Mrs Henderson.<br> Your husband<br> was a great friend to my country.<br> That's so kind of you.<br> Please join us at the house<br> for a small luncheon in his honour.<br> Thank you so much, Leslie...<br> but I think I'll take my own car.<br> Madam.<br> I know that Robert would want me to be<br> available to help you in any way.<br> Thank you so much.<br> - He was an estimable man.<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> And a very dangerous<br> business competitor.<br> Yes.<br> Oh. Please.<br> Excuse me.<br> I am bored with widowhood.<br> My dear,<br> you've just scratched the surface.<br> I have to smile at everybody.<br> I've never had to do that.<br> In India, there were always people<br> to look down on.<br> People are simply being sympathetic.<br> After all, you have lost your husband.<br> I didn't mislay him.<br> It was most inconsiderate<br> of Robert to die.<br> What on earth<br> am I supposed to do now?<br> The first rule of widowhood, my dear -<br> important conversations occur at lunch.<br> It's really not so bad.<br> Widows are allowed hobbies.<br> - Hobbies?<br> - Yes.<br> - Embroidery. Things like that.<br> - Are you mad?<br> I graduated to weaving.<br> - Would you care to see my tapestries?<br> - I'd rather drink ink.<br> Committees are good, of course.<br> I serve on quite a few.<br> Charities.<br> Once your husband dies,<br> it's quite permissible to help the poor.<br> And now there's no-one<br> to stop you buying things.<br> Also, of course, there's<br> a great deal of time for lovers.<br> - Margot, I'm nearly 70.<br> - That's true.<br> But you're also very rich.<br> The one cancels out the other.<br> I don't know anything<br> about embroidery.<br> Ow! Oh!<br> Now, I believe we may call it a refuge.<br> Certainly we do not want any term<br> alluding to unwed mothers in the title.<br> Nor do we wish for the public to know<br> the purpose of the house.<br> But I've told all my friends I'm helping<br> to build a home for future bastards.<br> Sorry.<br> - Home, madam?<br> - I need some fresh air. Let's drive.<br> Yes, madam.<br> I think I should see Alec.<br> Hello, Alec.<br> Let's return to London, please.<br> I'd rather like to visit<br> old Windmill Street again.<br> Good day, madam.<br> Oh.<br> - Mind your back.<br> - Oh!<br> - Oh, Laura, what on earth?<br> - Margo.<br> Renovations, dear.<br> - But it's a...<br> - Theatre.<br> It's a theatre. Isn't it delicious?<br> - I own it.<br> - Own it?<br> You told me now there was no-one<br> to stop me from buying things,<br> so I bought a theatre.<br> I meant bracelets and earrings.<br> What on earth are you going to do<br> with a theatre?<br> Well, I thought music hall, or - what do<br> they call it in America - vaudeville?<br> Actually, I haven't thought about it.<br> Oh, dear.<br> What am I going to do with it?<br> Clearly you need someone<br> to run it for you.<br> Oh, you think?<br> Oh, I knew you'd give me<br> sensible advice.<br> But who?<br> Well, that's an easy assignment.<br> I know just the man.<br> He's out of work at the moment,<br> but he's very good at running theatres.<br> I can't imagine where she is.<br> She was meant to be here<br> Well...<br> ...that's that, then.<br> I can't hang around here all morning.<br> I've an important meeting to go to.<br> - I'm sorry, old chum...<br> - Oh, he was terribly ill in the car.<br> Nerves, I imagine. Little sweet!<br> Hello, Leslie.<br> - Hello.<br> Who on earth are you?<br> - This is Vivian Van Damm.<br> - Don't be silly.<br> That's not a British name.<br> In actual fact,<br> my father's a lawyer in Bishopsgate.<br> Although some of his ancestors<br> are from Holland.<br> - Oh, dear God, you're Jewish!<br> - As it happens, I'm not.<br> Well, of course you are, dear.<br> Just look at yourself.<br> The show business is filled with Jewish<br> people, isn't it? One must make do.<br> We haven't met. I'm Laura Henderson.<br> Yes, I imagined you were.<br> You're 20 minutes late,<br> and you're rude.<br> - Perhaps he's the wrong man.<br> - No, I don't think so.<br> Where are you going?<br> Leslie, where is he off to? Do stop him.<br> I'm here to offer you a position!<br> You can't offer me a position<br> if I'm walking out on you.<br> But that's why I'm offering it, dear.<br> You've got gumption.<br> Oh, don't you adore that word?<br> And you're smoking a cigar.<br> Anyone who runs my theatre<br> must smoke a cigar.<br> It's so manly. And so...<br> What?<br> Jewish.<br> I have a theatre.<br> I have a theatre.<br> It's just sitting there,<br> waiting for a brilliant manager<br> to come and turn it into<br> a commercial proposition.<br> A manager who might bring<br> some enjoyment and amusement<br> back into the West End.<br> A manager with vision and courage.<br> And if that isn't you,<br> then my intuition has failed me.<br> So, by all means, hurry off,<br> Mr Damm Van.<br> Van Damm.<br> Oh, if you insist, dear. If you insist.<br> Whose idea was it to gut the building?<br> - Mine.<br> - Well, well.<br> There should be a sign saying<br> Windmill Theatre. Up there. See?<br> You're going to retain the name?<br> Well, I find it helps your driver<br> if the theatre is named after the street.<br> What do you know<br> about the theatre business?<br> Almost nothing.<br> I have to have total control<br> of the production side. Is that clear?<br> All artistic decisions are mine.<br> You may voice an opinion, if you must,<br> but I have the final say.<br> - Understood?<br> - Of course.<br> I think we'll make a splendid team.<br> Let's go and sit down<br> in that charming little caf.<br> I'm sure its business will improve<br> when our musical revue opens.<br> Who said we were doing<br> a musical revue?<br> Well, I assumed.<br> All those decisions are mine.<br> Remember?<br> That's perfect. Just there.<br> Higher.<br> No. No, no, no. Come back.<br> Come back to the middle.<br> Higher.<br> Higher.<br> Fine. I've had an idea. Let's go inside.<br> It is a radical idea.<br> Oh, jolly good. What is it?<br> Non-stop performances.<br> - Non-stop?<br> - Yes.<br> Instead of two shows a day,<br> we run our show all day long.<br> Five or six performances a day,<br> one after another.<br> It's never been done in England before.<br> Every theatre here<br> is exactly like every other theatre.<br> No-one is attempting anything new.<br> It's good to stir things up,<br> don't you think?<br> We'd be a sensation.<br> I've no idea what you're on about,<br> but I do admire passion.<br> Yes, well... what else is there?<br> How much will this experiment cost?<br> I mean,<br> what do I stand to lose if it fails?<br> Well, anything up to er... 10,000.<br> What fun!<br> I'm in a sporting mood today,<br> Mr Van Damm. It must be the weather.<br> - And what'll we do?<br> - A musical revue.<br> What will we call it?<br> Well, I thought Revudeville.<br> Oh, yes!<br> That's lovely.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...I've invited you here this evening<br> to sip a bit of sherry -<br> I'm told cocktail parties<br> are out-of-date -<br> and to announce<br> the most amusing news.<br> The Windmill Theatre<br> will open on February 3rd,<br> with the most revolutionary programme<br> ever seen in England.<br> In this enterprise, I shall be carrying on<br> the work of my late husband,<br> who spent a great deal of time<br> and money helping stage people,<br> especially those in the field of variety.<br> - Is that true?<br> - She's making it up.<br> Oh.<br> As you well know,<br> these are difficult times,<br> so many of our delightful<br> variety performers<br> have been forced onto the milk line.<br> - Bread line.<br> - Bread line. Bread line.<br> Revudeville is an attempt to create...<br> - Employment.<br> ... employment.<br> Employment...<br> for these delightful creatures.<br> Our productions will be guided<br> and overseen by our resident genius,<br> Our brilliant general manager,<br> who comes to us from Central Europe,<br> Mr Vivian Van Damm.<br> We won't be able to work together,<br> you know that.<br> You're a perfect match.<br> So, you found yourself a continental.<br> Nonsense. He's as English as you or I.<br> But he's terribly alive, don't you think?<br> It's just something one can sense.<br> - Laura, you have an infatuation.<br> - Oh, don't be ridiculous.<br> It's the show business I'm attracted to.<br> Tomorrow we have auditions!<br> Isn't that exciting?<br> People come in and entertain us<br> and we say either<br> "stick around" or "buzz off. "<br> - Thank you, that'll do.<br> Poor thing.<br> - Next!<br> - My dear, would you wait over there?<br> Mr Van Damm, I spent many years<br> in the Far East with my husband<br> witnessing what one might call<br> pagan rituals,<br> but I've never seen anything<br> as barbaric as this.<br> Welcome to the theatre.<br> Next!<br> Very nice, dear.<br> Buy yourself a decent meal.<br> Who's the young man at the back?<br> Ssh! Concentrate on the auditions.<br> We'll have him.<br> We will?<br> We will.<br> Next!<br> Why do you keep looking at that boy?<br> That boy, as you call him,<br> was the featured performer at the Pavilion.<br> We snatched him away.<br> He can be a big help to me.<br> He's got excellent taste.<br> He seems to agree<br> with all of my choices.<br> Including these<br> demented pharaohs?<br> - Book them.<br> - Right, VD.<br> Are you mad?<br> They're not in the least authentic.<br> And over, over,<br> step, shuffle, change. Riff, pick up, toe.<br> Pick up and five, six, seven, eight.<br> Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up again.<br> Maxie Ford and heads up.<br> Thank you,<br> ladies. Change over. Quickly, girls!<br> See what they're like<br> from the back of the stalls.<br> Pay attention to their height.<br> And over. Step, shuffle and change.<br> Riff, pick up, toe.<br> Tap, tap, change, pick up, step,<br> and round, two, three, four.<br> Pick up, step, pick up, step,<br> pick up and change.<br> Maxie Ford and heads up.<br> Do you find these women attractive?<br> - Some of them are very pretty.<br> - Oh, yes, I can certainly see that.<br> But... do they intrigue you as a man?<br> - I have other inclinations.<br> - Oh.<br> Oh! Oh, how delicious!<br> And use your backs.<br> Yes, girls. Next group.<br> And use your back, girls.<br> Yes! Last group.<br> But Mr Van Damm seems to have<br> an intense appreciation, doesn't he?<br> Other girls, ready. And!<br> He's practically sniffing them.<br> And last group.<br> - Some of these girls are very good.<br> - Indeed.<br> I'm going to call our chorus<br> The Millerettes.<br> - Millerettes?<br> - Mill, as in Windmill.<br> - What's the "er" for?<br> - What?<br> Millerettes. It should be Millettes.<br> The "er" clogs it up.<br> - Millettes doesn't scan.<br> - But it's accurate.<br> It doesn't sound right.<br> Millerettes sounds like a man<br> named Miller has a chorus line.<br> We're doing a vaudeville,<br> not a dictionary.<br> It isn't correct English!<br> Millerettes is a good name.<br> And it's not your decision.<br> In fact, it's got nothing to do with you.<br> In fact, you shouldn't be in the theatre<br> until dress rehearsal.<br> - In fact, I'm going to ban you!<br> - Don't you dare!<br> - I'm banning you from all auditions.<br> - You haven't the right.<br> - I can do anything I please.<br> - I shall cancel the opening.<br> Fine!<br> - This show will not goon!<br> - Indeed.<br> They're ready to start again, VD.<br> My dear, you must never interrupt<br> a perfectly good argument.<br> - I've lost my train of thought.<br> - So have I.<br> Come on.<br> Mustn't keep The Millerettes waiting.<br> Oh, that name's intolerable.<br> It suggests midgets<br> working in a factory.<br> Millettes sounds like<br> a medical condition.<br> Thank you, Mr Van Damm.<br> Thank you, Mrs Henderson.<br> Stop thanking each other.<br> Let's find some champagne.<br> Oh, what a wonderful hobby, my dear.<br> I wonder if there are<br> any more theatres for sale.<br> I don't understand.<br> We were such a success.<br> And then everyone copied us.<br> - You're telling me we're a disaster?<br> - Here's the accounts.<br> You're losing a fortune.<br> You mean you can be a triumph<br> one week and a disaster the next?<br> I'm not certain it's worth going on.<br> Oh, you people make me weary!<br> You've no courage.<br> What I say is, stick a thing out<br> and it will come right.<br> I'm trying to save your finances.<br> I don't need your protection,<br> thank you very much.<br> We've put on good shows, but they're<br> obviously not daring enough.<br> Why don't we get rid of the clothes?<br> Pardon?<br> Let's have naked girls.<br> Don't you think?<br> Now, this has been on my mind<br> for some time.<br> I never dared mention it.<br> I too lack courage, it seems.<br> Now, what I propose is that we have<br> nude women in Revudeville.<br> As they do in Paris.<br> At our namesake, the Moulin Rouge,<br> for instance.<br> Oh, Baby, we'll find you some milk.<br> Paris, after all, is just filled with<br> naked women wearing bananas,<br> and dare I say, making everyone else<br> go bananas in return.<br> - Do keep up, Mr Van Damm.<br> - Yes.<br> It would be innovative<br> and draw the crowds.<br> I would make back all of my money.<br> You, I imagine, would enjoy yourself,<br> being surrounded by countless breasts,<br> and we'd all be happy.<br> What you're suggesting<br> isn't possible.<br> That kind of thing<br> isn't done here.<br> Nudity? In England?<br> You tend towards safety sometimes,<br> Mr Van Damm.<br> You're rather bourgeois.<br> I do mean that in a kind way.<br> But I suspect it's not advisable<br> in the show business.<br> What you're forgetting is we need<br> a licence from the Lord Chamberlain<br> for whatever we put on the stage.<br> He'll never approve it.<br> - The Lord Chamberlain?<br> - Yes, The Lord Chamberlain.<br> What, Tommy? Little Tommy Baring?<br> Oh, don't be silly!<br> I have, of course,<br> taken that into account.<br> He's a very sweet man.<br> He and his rather dreary wife<br> are on holiday in France,<br> but as soon as he returns,<br> I'll throw a fly at him.<br> Pardon?<br> That's a fisherman's term, dear.<br> It has to do with hooking a trout.<br> You do lead a narrow life.<br> Meanwhile, do begin work<br> on our marvellous new idea.<br> Without permission?<br> Oh! We've found your milk!<br> Mrs Henderson's request is,<br> of course, entirely out of order.<br> Of course. I'm well aware of that.<br> - Oh, Tommy!<br> - Laura, how wonderful to see you.<br> - You don't look a day older.<br> - What a touching little lie.<br> I do know a bit about why you're here,<br> you know.<br> - Oh?<br> - Hm.<br> I find that lines have to be drawn<br> somewhere, my dear Laura,<br> and nudity<br> is on the wrong side of the divide.<br> I have problems enough<br> with the length of skirts.<br> I've had to have inches added to them<br> for the new Offenbach production.<br> Well, we won't have that problem<br> as we won't have skirts.<br> Sir? If I may?<br> We have very strict rules<br> in these areas, Mrs Henderson.<br> Oh, this office is so stuffy.<br> Why don't we take a bit of a walk?<br> - Sir?<br> - A walk. Yes. Lovely.<br> Why didn't you return to India?<br> I was only ever Robert's wife in India.<br> It seemed a bit absurd<br> without a Robert.<br> Now I find it most amusing to run<br> a variety show, and I'll tell you why.<br> Robert took me to music hall<br> quite often - he was fond of them -<br> On condition that I stayed behind the<br> curtain in a box and was never visible.<br> In those days, it was considered<br> terribly improper<br> for a married woman<br> to be seen at a music hall.<br> But times have moved on.<br> And we must move with them,<br> mustn't we?<br> Oh, look! A tent!<br> It's unusual to see a tent in the park.<br> Quite so.<br> I had it constructed this morning.<br> Did you obtain a licence?<br> Oh, come inside, you old fogey.<br> I've prepared lunch.<br> But the be-all and end-all, finally,<br> is that they are naked.<br> Like paintings. In a museum.<br> These sandwiches<br> are particularly good.<br> It's an excellent season for salmon.<br> We haven't exactly reached<br> salmon season yet.<br> Tommy, you're so literal.<br> You're thinking bosoms,<br> but I'm thinking breasts.<br> - What is the difference?<br> - The difference is in your soul.<br> - Cheese?<br> - Thank you.<br> Of course, paintings in a museum<br> are still, are they not?<br> Still?<br> The figures do not move.<br> I suppose there's something in that.<br> Mm, this cheese is very good indeed.<br> If the girls did not move...<br> Tableaux?<br> Precisely.<br> Then one might make a direct corollary<br> with an art gallery.<br> I can perhaps see the possibility<br> of some artistic merit.<br> - They never move?<br> - Never.<br> Yes, that would be like a museum.<br> Which was, my dear, your suggestion,<br> so you must be very pleased.<br> I'm warming to the idea.<br> - My secretary would be appalled...<br> - More wine?<br> Ah, yes, thank you.<br> Now, what about...<br> forgive me... the foliage?<br> Foliage?<br> You know... beneath the...<br> - Beneath what? Try the brie.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Beneath...<br> - Flown in from France.<br> - Excellent. The foliage beneath the...<br> - My husband was very fond of it.<br> - Of what?<br> - This particular cheese.<br> My dear, I am attempting to address<br> the disagreeable and somewhat<br> sordid topic of the pudendum.<br> - What on earth is that?<br> - Good heavens, woman!<br> - Have some more wine.<br> - The female part.<br> Oh! The pussy!<br> Why didn't you say?<br> I had not expected you, of all people,<br> to use such language.<br> That word was popular<br> in the mid-nineteenth century.<br> Not everyone speaks Latin, you know.<br> Then I'd prefer you refer to it as...<br> the midlands.<br> Oh, dear.<br> You men do get into such a state<br> about the midlands, don't you?<br> Well, you needn't worry.<br> Our lighting will be so subtle,<br> the disputed area will be barely visible.<br> Anyway, we'll have a barber.<br> You are the most exasperating woman!<br> You always were.<br> I take that to mean<br> you'll permit us to have a go.<br> As long as no-one moves, yes.<br> Perhaps.<br> I reserve final judgment...<br> until opening night.<br> I'm delighted, dear ladies, that you all<br> wish to be a part of our endeavour.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Saliva.<br> - Behave!<br> I've never realised<br> how similar breasts are to shoes.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - They come in so many sizes.<br> I've always found them<br> rather overrated, myself.<br> Well, you're not a man.<br> Alas.<br> All right, ladies. Off you go.<br> What do you make of her?<br> - She's beautiful.<br> - Yes.<br> But the nipples...<br> Too large?<br> They're not British.<br> Could be Italian.<br> We must have British nipples.<br> And how about her?<br> The right one's bigger than the left.<br> Her.<br> Fried eggs.<br> Sorry.<br> Thank you very much. Could you all<br> please wait in the wings? Thank you.<br> - What, basically, are you looking for?<br> - Personality.<br> Something in their smile, their eyes.<br> Well, I suggest you start looking<br> in their faces.<br> Yes, of course!<br> We're looking at the wrong kind of girl.<br> We shouldn't have theatricals.<br> - Maggie, make a note.<br> - My dear?<br> Bertie and I<br> are going to tour the countryside<br> and discover some English roses.<br> Oh, good!<br> Now you're getting the hang of it.<br> It's been an unsuccessful trip,<br> my friend.<br> What I'm looking for is... personality.<br> Youth. Beauty.<br> Certainly not talent.<br> Anyone can have talent.<br> And they must be well brought up.<br> I think many of the young women<br> we've been seeing<br> come from<br> rather awkward backgrounds.<br> Shine the light on the water!<br> Don't panic! The young fellow's<br> a dancer. Excellent coordination.<br> That's it. Pull her... That's it.<br> Come on. There we go. There you are.<br> - You're all right.<br> - Let me see.<br> Oh, my God!<br> I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.<br> I didn't mean to cause any trouble.<br> No need to be embarrassed.<br> You've found a knight.<br> Two knights, in shining armour.<br> My God! What a beautiful smile!<br> Exquisite.<br> Have you ever considered<br> going on the stage?<br> You moved.<br> - She mustn't move!<br> - I'm sorry, Mr Van Damm.<br> The law insists<br> that you be absolutely still.<br> - Why don't we take a break?<br> - Yes, good idea.<br> Rest your arms, girls.<br> Get the circulation going.<br> - There's er... teacups and...<br> - Tea.<br> ...tea just downstairs.<br> Oh! Oh, it's so sweet!<br> You're perched in the orchestra pit<br> like little birds.<br> It feels safe down here.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, thank you. My arm went numb.<br> I would sometimes see people in India<br> standing still for hours on end, my dear.<br> They were called fakirs.<br> It was all rather spiritual.<br> Oh, I see.<br> You must think yourself<br> onto a higher plane.<br> We'd all like to be on a higher plane<br> now, Mrs Henderson.<br> Preferably flying over the Channel.<br> - Oh, you're the one that was...<br> - Drowning.<br> - Come on.<br> - I like that girl you ran over.<br> Why don't you and the dog have a look<br> at the programme proofs in the office?<br> - You're trying to get rid of us.<br> - It's a delicate time.<br> All the more reason for<br> a motherly presence.<br> Maggie!<br> Take Mrs Henderson to the office.<br> - Out!<br> - Well, of course.<br> You're in charge.<br> Right.<br> Time for you to disrobe.<br> Do we have to do it now,<br> Mr Van Damm?<br> - Well, when else?<br> - I was just asking.<br> - Should have left you in the water.<br> - Come on, girls, let's do it.<br> I can't!<br> Where's she going?<br> - She can't face it.<br> What's wrong with everybody?<br> I'm sorry, Mr Van Damm.<br> There's no work outside.<br> I just thought, well it's a job.<br> All of my friends are starving.<br> I was... lucky to have employment.<br> But...<br> You can't imagine what it feels like,<br> just standing there.<br> Not even my boyfriend<br> has seen me naked.<br> And we've been to bed and everything.<br> It's like it's... medical.<br> Do you think... I would ever subject you<br> to anything improper or tawdry?<br> I am enabling you to earn an honest<br> salary in this most difficult of times.<br> After a hard week's work, you can take<br> home enough to maintain your home,<br> help out your parents<br> and even save a little bit for the future.<br> And all you have to do<br> is display certain blessings<br> you received from the Lord.<br> Why do you think God gave you<br> all your bits and pieces?<br> So that you might be<br> ashamed of them?<br> So that you might hide them away?<br> Isn't great art, after all,<br> a celebration of nature?<br> - That's what this is.<br> - Art?<br> Absolutely.<br> You are the Venus de Milo,<br> the Mona Lisa...<br> The Mona Lisa wore a dress.<br> Some do, some don't.<br> Tomorrow, we'll go to the museum<br> and look at some paintings.<br> Botticelli.<br> Now, he was inspired.<br> Inspired by God.<br> If I'm placing a weighty burden<br> on your shoulders,<br> then I know you have<br> the moral strength to carry it.<br> Why don't we try it again?<br> All right?<br> I'll see you on the stage.<br> Come on, girls,<br> let's give it a go.<br> I don't fancy working<br> in my father's chemist.<br> Art. Art.<br> Sorry.<br> Actually, there is a draught in here,<br> Mr Van Damm.<br> You expect that in a theatre.<br> You expect draughts.<br> - But what happens if we catch cold?<br> - Bertie!<br> Get someone to close the doors<br> and check all the windows, will you?<br> Thank you. All right?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> Does everyone have to watch us?<br> - Who?<br> - Well, them.<br> You're going to have<br> an entire audience watching you.<br> Yes, but they'll be strangers.<br> And they won't be standing so close...<br> will they?<br> - We can hear them breathing.<br> - A man has to breathe.<br> Heavy breathing.<br> After all, it doesn't seem fair for them<br> to be dressed when we're not.<br> Okey-doke. I know what to do.<br> Come on, gentlemen. Come on.<br> You too.<br> - What?<br> - Fair is fair.<br> Let's make the ladies comfortable.<br> Come on.<br> Strip.<br> You too, Mr Van Damm.<br> Don't be ridiculous. Someone has to<br> maintain authority here.<br> - Take your clothes off, please.<br> - No.<br> Off! Off! Off!<br> Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!<br> Off! Off! Off! Off!<br> All right! All right!<br> Bloody childish!<br> Mrs Henderson. Mrs Henderson!<br> Why, Mr Van Damm...<br> ...you are Jewish!<br> - I think I saw a priest in the audience.<br> - Oh, stop it! You're hallucinating!<br> - Everyone looked so rich.<br> - Oh, I hope so.<br> When I take off my clothes,<br> I close my eyes and think,<br> "This will bring me champagne. "<br> I think, "One more day<br> and it hasn't happened yet. "<br> Oh, my God!<br> I've brought<br> the Lord Chamberlain.<br> He felt he had to say a few words<br> of encouragement to you.<br> Isn't that delicious?<br> Well done.<br> Well done. I...<br> May I be... permitted to say...<br> ...that... Oh, good heavens!<br> Good heavens! I...<br> I...<br> What an artistic enterprise er...<br> you have um...<br> A testament, really, to the British p...<br> - It's a magical evening.<br> - Hm?<br> I quite understand<br> what you were feeling.<br> I myself have exhibited my breasts.<br> I was at a party in Antibes<br> with The Duchess of Denby<br> and Countess Volpe,<br> and we took off our blouses -<br> in private, of course -<br> and looked at each other's titties.<br> My, how we laughed!<br> The Lord Chamberlain<br> was very taken with you, my dear.<br> - Mrs Henderson.<br> - Mr Van Damm. Quite an evening.<br> The Lord Chamberlain<br> was very pleased.<br> I wanted you to meet Natalie.<br> - Natalie?<br> - My wife.<br> Vivian's spoken about you sooften,<br> I just feel that I know you.<br> Well... I certainly don't know you!<br> Excuse me.<br> You can be rude to me,<br> but not to my wife!<br> What wife?<br> When did you acquire a wife?<br> - Why haven't you told us?<br> - What do you mean?<br> You never mentioned her.<br> I believe a figure of authority<br> must maintain a sense of privacy.<br> Good heavens! A wife!<br> What exactly is the problem?<br> Who on earth said<br> there was a problem?<br> Fine. Have a wife, if you insist.<br> Just don't let her interfere<br> with any of your duties.<br> - Why would she do that?<br> - That's what wives do.<br> That's their purpose. I know.<br> I was a wife.<br> I interfered all the time.<br> So sack me, then!<br> If you're unhappy with me,<br> just say it and I'll leave!<br> But don't you dare ever, ever<br> talk to my wife like that again!<br> Oh, don't you worry.<br> I'll keep my eye on you.<br> You do that.<br> I hope you realise I will never, ever,<br> ever set foot in this theatre again!<br> You two behave<br> like an old married couple.<br> Well, it seems<br> that would make him a bigamist.<br> Champagne, then?<br> It is rather as I thought.<br> Your heart has stirred.<br> Then I must consult a physician.<br> This should have been<br> such a pleasant night.<br> - I want you to flank her.<br> - Flank her?<br> - Stand either side of her.<br> - Oh.<br> Aren't I in silhouette, like in the picture?<br> - Silhouette.<br> - Silhouette, Harry!<br> - And the sun must rise behind you.<br> - Orange.<br> We see the rays of the sun,<br> like in the picture.<br> A new dawn over the New World.<br> Goody, goody.<br> Goody, goody.<br> Goody, goody.<br> And now...<br> - How...<br> ... do you do?<br> Do something!<br> How will I explain this<br> to the Lord Chamberlain?<br> Coming through!<br> Excuse me, Mr Van Damm. Sorry.<br> I forgot my fin.<br> It'll have to be tighter than that.<br> - Good afternoon, Doris.<br> - Afternoon.<br> - How's your mother?<br> - She's fine, thank you.<br> Have you been writing<br> to her every week?<br> Yes. She told me to tell you<br> she's very disappointed I'm a starfish.<br> - She thinks I should be a mermaid.<br> - Ah. I'll send her a note.<br> - And who have we here?<br> - Catherine the Great.<br> Have you forgotten<br> the tableau of the wars?<br> Come along, Mr Van Damm.<br> Wakey-wakey.<br> You might show a bit more respect.<br> - I think I should have...<br> ... left you in the water.<br> - Afternoon, girls. How are you?<br> - Better now, Mr Van Damm.<br> - Was something wrong?<br> - My bum cheeks went numb.<br> She was leaning arse over backwards.<br> In the Alaskan tableau, of course.<br> All that ice.<br> But Rupert soon got<br> the blood flowing!<br> - Who's Rupert?<br> - Well you might ask.<br> Behave yourself!<br> We must be cautious<br> about too much frivolity.<br> The Windmill<br> is a very serious business!<br> Yes, Mr Van Damm.<br> - Do I give it to the students again, sir?<br> - Mr Van Damm.<br> At your own discretion, dear boy.<br> It's beastly.<br> I can't walk into my own theatre.<br> I hear wonderful things<br> about the new performances<br> and I'm missing all the fun.<br> You did say you would never set foot<br> in the The Windmill again.<br> Quite right.<br> The man's a monster.<br> I want nothing to do with him.<br> You're very much like<br> my granddaughter<br> who moans about the boy<br> she has her eye on.<br> Adolescents and women in their<br> eighth decade are strikingly similar.<br> You obviously require a battle plan.<br> My second husband, the General,<br> always advocated<br> attacking from the rear,<br> which, although it did nothing<br> to enhance our marriage,<br> did bring him some success<br> on the field.<br> Just slip in there, as it were,<br> and establish your beachhead.<br> Excuse us!<br> This is a private dressing room.<br> It's only me.<br> I'm sorry, but I did not want to be seen<br> in the theatre.<br> Oh, I have missed your company.<br> I thought I'd just drop by<br> to see if you needed anything.<br> Actually, if this may be our secret -<br> Mr um... Whatshisname<br> doesn't know I'm here.<br> We're fine, thank you, Mrs Henderson.<br> My poor dear, I'm having some cheese<br> sent up to you.<br> - Cheese?<br> - I'm not convinced you eat enough.<br> Yes, it's terribly sad.<br> She's just skin and bones.<br> Shut up! I weigh exactly what I weighed<br> the day I started this job, no less.<br> Something's wrong.<br> She won't eat chocolate truffles.<br> - She's so very, very head-girl.<br> - So sensible!<br> You see, it's unanimous.<br> You're positively scrawny!<br> You may laugh, but I know men.<br> Men look at bosoms, my dear,<br> but I notice bones.<br> What?<br> Spots!<br> No-one will notice.<br> Now, you must promise to let me know<br> if you have any complaints<br> or problems.<br> I mean, does Mr Van Damm treat...<br> Oh, my dear!<br> I wore a similar wig to a ball in Delhi.<br> Didn't look nearly as becoming<br> as it does on you.<br> Thank you, Mrs Henderson.<br> You remind me a bit of myself<br> at that time.<br> - Not too thin?<br> - Oh, you'd be surprised.<br> Now, remember not to tell anyone<br> I've been here.<br> Of course not. It's just between us girls.<br> - You all get on rather well, don't you?<br> - Yes, we're like a family.<br> There hasn't been<br> any improper behaviour?<br> - From Mr Van Damm, that is.<br> - He's very good to us, Mrs Henderson.<br> He's like a father.<br> If fathers were nice.<br> - He treats us as what we are.<br> - And what is that?<br> Artists.<br> I have seemingly handed him<br> a kingdom.<br> Complete with harem.<br> Then, my dear,<br> you must infiltrate.<br> Like a delicious,<br> if overripe, Mata Hari.<br> Might I propose subterfuge?<br> Good afternoon.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Amazing. We get all kinds.<br> I have a very odd feeling, VD.<br> What I really need<br> is a rubber trumpet. Yes.<br> I've had an offer to join a rubber band!<br> Please don't do this!<br> Mrs Henderson, you are a fraud!<br> Oh. Oh!<br> Don't you dare manhandle me!<br> - Make a fool of yourself, if you must...<br> - Mr Van Damm!<br> ...but not of me!<br> - No! Argh!<br> What on earth do you think<br> you were doing?<br> I simply want to make sure<br> you are doing your job properly.<br> It was most unpleasant of you<br> to grab my hairpiece.<br> That's made of authentic<br> Chinese hair!<br> Well, now you'll have some time<br> to calm down<br> and examine your behaviour.<br> My husband put me<br> on top of a cupboard once.<br> You have so much in common.<br> I'd like you to behave.<br> No doubt your husband said that to you<br> as well.<br> Oh, Mr Van Damm...<br> ...I just can't help myself.<br> Well... cheerio, then.<br> No! Don't you dare leave me here!<br> No, don't you dare!<br> Don't you dare leave me!<br> This act's not half bad.<br> Thank you... very much.<br> You can't have an animal on stage<br> with naked women.<br> Yes, I see that.<br> It's a shame.<br> - I've got the new song.<br> Let's hear it.<br> Slower.<br> - What?<br> # The girl in the little green hat<br> You better see for yourself.<br> Hi, Mrs Henderson!<br> Try the river. It's Tuesday.<br> - Get me a taxi.<br> - Yes, VD.<br> - Tea?<br> - Yes, please. To take away.<br> We need a lot of caffeine.<br> We're exhausted.<br> You're exhausted?<br> All you girls do is just stand there.<br> And that, I am told,<br> is the definition of a star.<br> This has got to stop!<br> We're running a serious theatre.<br> The entire West End is laughing at us.<br> I haven't worked for years<br> to achieve a position of respect<br> Only to be perceived as a joke!<br> If all you want to be is a dilettante,<br> take your money and go someplace else!<br> I can't... hear you!<br> I'm not simply frivolous, you know.<br> And I don't ever, ever<br> want to be taken for granted.<br> Actually, I wished to ascertain<br> that artists who audition for us<br> are being treated<br> with the proper respect.<br> It turns out they are.<br> I am perfectly satisfied.<br> On another matter entirely,<br> I was thinking about billing.<br> The programme says<br> "Mrs Henderson Presents Revudeville. "<br> It's absolutely charming,<br> but perhaps unfair.<br> Shouldn't it be<br> "Mrs Henderson Presents Revudeville -<br> a Vivian Van Damm production"?<br> I rather like that, don't you?<br> I'm going to have a joyride now.<br> Isn't that exciting?<br> I am not a servant!<br> You can't buy me off<br> with a piece of billing!<br> Do you hear? Bloody woman!<br> Is it well stocked with petrol?<br> What do you mean?<br> Do you think<br> we might make it to France?<br> I don't think I'll be back for a while.<br> Hitler invades France<br> - Mr Van Damm.<br> Mrs Henderson.<br> Welcome back.<br> - Thank you.<br> Do you mind if I sit here for a while?<br> Suit yourself.<br> I'm so sorry, Mr Van Damm.<br> I imagine...<br> ...you have family.<br> Yes.<br> I can't bear feeling helpless.<br> I always think<br> there's something I can do.<br> But sometimes, of course...<br> there's nothing.<br> Champagne, madam?<br> Attention!<br> Don't you feel a bit over-safe?<br> Caution, my dear, caution.<br> You know, we're not certain what to do<br> about the theatres.<br> - Whatever do you mean?<br> - They're a frivolous distraction.<br> Exactly what young soldiers need.<br> Wouldn't you say?<br> There are other considerations.<br> Our intelligence tells us<br> the Luftwaffe will bomb London.<br> My dear, my intelligence tells me that.<br> Then it will be dangerous<br> for people to congregate, won't it?<br> Oh, Tommy! Don't be silly!<br> Congregate underground?<br> Remember,<br> my theatre is beneath street level.<br> It's the safest place to be.<br> Now, let's have no more<br> of these foolish ideas.<br> Oh, Tommy!<br> Fires were started again last nlght<br> In the East End.<br> Londoners awoke after the tenth<br> consecutlve night of bombardment<br> by the German air force.<br> We have a huge challenge before us.<br> It's up to us, Revudeville,<br> to fortify London in a way that<br> sandbags and anti-aircraft cannot do.<br> They may bomb our city,<br> destroy our homes,<br> kill our friends and neighbours,<br> but through it all,<br> our show will continue.<br> We will never stop performing,<br> and we will never close!<br> He thinks<br> he's bloody Winston Churchill.<br> Some of our family are going.<br> Called up.<br> Yes.<br> Thank God our Bertie<br> has a heart murmur.<br> It may be wise for some of you<br> to move into the theatre.<br> We have room,<br> and because we're underground, we're safe.<br> Of course, we'll all have our war duties<br> as well as theatrical ones.<br> But...<br> we will pitch in and we will do our bit.<br> That was beautifully put,<br> Mr Van Damm.<br> I'm sure we will all make<br> the necessary sacrifices.<br> Yesterday I wanted to buy a new hat.<br> I desisted.<br> I put the money<br> in National Savings instead.<br> We shall come through.<br> Ken said you were up here.<br> I didn't believe him.<br> Why ever not?<br> It's bloody dangerous, that's why!<br> Come on down.<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear.<br> The aircraft have passed.<br> Look, you can see them<br> over the East End.<br> You're ever so cautious,<br> Mr Van Damm.<br> One shouldn't be overly so<br> at times like these.<br> Everyone should be cautious.<br> You don't seem to take war<br> too seriously, Mrs Henderson.<br> I wonder what you were like<br> when you were young.<br> Rather dashing, I dare say.<br> And filled with hope.<br> My mind turns towards young men<br> these days.<br> You see, Mr Van Damm,<br> I take war far more seriously<br> than you can ever dare imagine.<br> No, you'll have to cover her<br> faster than that.<br> - You need to be a lot faster.<br> - Those things weigh a ton, Bertie.<br> Goon. Take five minutes.<br> No, no, no... get it up.<br> I just can't lift it higher.<br> Oh, my dear, how generous.<br> - My goodness!<br> - Gin.<br> Help steel our nerves for the air raids.<br> It does seem they're no longer bombing<br> during the tableaux.<br> Well, that's because Mr Van Damm<br> sent Hitler our programme.<br> Professional courtesy between Fhrers.<br> You're all so energetic and courageous.<br> We're the only theatre<br> still playing in the West End.<br> Then you all go out with the soldiers<br> after the show. It's admirable.<br> Oh, but I don't. Well, I never go out.<br> My dear, why ever not?<br> Before I started stripping off<br> for a living, I was always falling in love.<br> I was hopeless.<br> Never again.<br> So I've become a right little priss.<br> A naked spinster.<br> And that's the way I like it.<br> Who would have dreamed<br> that standing on a stage<br> without any clothes on<br> would be the safest place to be?<br> Could you er... come this way, sir?<br> Mrs Henderson<br> would like to speak to you.<br> Who's the flower for?<br> The girl inside the fan.<br> Speak up, dear.<br> - The girl in the fan.<br> Oh. Yes.<br> - How old are you?<br> - 21.<br> Too young for her, I suppose.<br> Come back tomorrow night.<br> Sweet.<br> I was always afraid that someday<br> I'd end up working in a florist shop.<br> - And now you are.<br> - I'm getting hay fever.<br> And who is Paul?<br> I have no idea.<br> Are you girls decent?<br> Oh, good.<br> I've brought someone.<br> This is Paul.<br> Oh. I see. Erm...<br> Girls, can you er...<br> - I was... looking forward to...<br> - Speak up, dear.<br> Would you mind<br> if I had a moment alone?<br> Thank you.<br> - You've sent all these flowers.<br> - Don't be foolish, my dear.<br> I recognised the name of your florist.<br> He can't afford this sort of thing.<br> He comes from<br> a very distinguished family.<br> - Mrs Henderson!<br> - Well...<br> Truth is so prosaic.<br> He's young. That's all.<br> And rather well put together,<br> wouldn't you say?<br> That face.<br> He's young.<br> And in five days he goes to the front.<br> And he may not come back.<br> - And it's so lonely out there in the...<br> - Trenches.<br> Yes, I know the word.<br> Books have been written<br> about the last war,<br> and I have actually read some of them.<br> And I suppose he saw me on stage<br> and fell in love.<br> Mrs Henderson,<br> one night my bicycle went off the road<br> and the next thing I knew,<br> I was an illusion.<br> Because that's all we are up there.<br> But the odd thing is I'm still in<br> that river, and I want to be rescued.<br> But not by some drum roll<br> or applause or a soldier's fantasy.<br> Oh, dear,<br> you're such a tiresome generation.<br> You all want love.<br> We got along very nicely without it,<br> thank you very much.<br> I don't see why that boy's fantasy<br> is any more foolish than yours.<br> Oh, damn.<br> She loved your flowers, dear.<br> What flowers?<br> Trouble, boss.<br> - Is it that bloody woman again?<br> - No, not this time, VD.<br> Open up!<br> Do you want me to<br> knock the door down?<br> You'll hurt your shoulder.<br> Get inside.<br> You can't do this.<br> - Why not?<br> - You're part of our family.<br> A terrible choice of words.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I don't want to discuss it.<br> But you have to tell me what's<br> behind this. You owe it to me.<br> My concern for<br> the aesthetics of Revudeville.<br> What?<br> I don't think you want a nude on stage<br> who is pregnant!<br> - Oh, Christ!<br> - 'Scuse me, Mr Van Damm.<br> We were having<br> a private discussion.<br> - We have a quick change.<br> - Yes.<br> That was a particularly fine<br> programme, Mr Van Damm.<br> - I am pleased I recognised your talent.<br> - Go back into the theatre.<br> I do have a few notes<br> about the comedy routine.<br> We don't have time for nonsense.<br> We have a crisis.<br> Why? Whatever's wrong?<br> Maureen has just sent me<br> a letter of resignation.<br> Don't be ridiculous.<br> Why would she?<br> Because she's pregnant.<br> Two minutes, girls!<br> - Oh, my dear...<br> - I need some air.<br> Look... You can work in the show<br> as a singer for the next few months.<br> We'll keep you on salary,<br> until you...<br> I can't think clearly. I need some air.<br> I'm so sorry. Was it?<br> Well, who else would it be?<br> He sent me a letter.<br> After he's demobbed,<br> he's going back to his girlfriend.<br> His girlfriend!<br> They all have girlfriends.<br> The crazy thing is, I fell for him.<br> Oh, it's not your fault. I'm a grown girl.<br> I knew what I was doing.<br> But he had such a sweet face...<br> They all have sweet faces.<br> You live in your own world,<br> Mrs Henderson.<br> I'm sorry. Excuse me.<br> I don't want to say something<br> I shouldn't.<br> I need some tea. And some air.<br> She said, "It's not your fault. "<br> That can only mean one thing.<br> - Which is?<br> - That it Is your fault!<br> - What have you been up to?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Have you been giving advice?<br> - I don't like these questions.<br> Excuse me, Mr Van Damm.<br> I want to take some air as well.<br> You can't go out, Mrs Henderson.<br> The sirens went.<br> We didn't hear anything.<br> - A few minutes ago.<br> - Maureen's gone out.<br> - When?<br> - Just now.<br> Why didn't you stop her?<br> Where's she going?<br> - For some air.<br> - No, to tea, she said.<br> You foolish, foolish woman.<br> Look what you've done.<br> I thought, "Yes, well,<br> she's selfish and rude and eccentric,<br> but that goes with her class.<br> I can live with that. "<br> I was a fool.<br> You don't know anything<br> about the real world, do you?<br> It's not the same.<br> The boys love it, boss.<br> I'm from the Lord Chamberlain's office.<br> This is for you.<br> We have to close your theatre.<br> What?<br> It's causing too many people<br> to congregate in front of it.<br> Telephone the newspapers.<br> Get them down here.<br> Yes, boss.<br> Maggie...<br> I know where to find her.<br> Tell her to come to the theatre<br> immediately.<br> Mrs Henderson would like to see<br> Lord Cromer as soon as possible.<br> Here, at the theatre.<br> I don't think<br> the Lord Chamberlain is available...<br> Nonsense.<br> Mrs Henderson wishes to see him.<br> Pray, pass the message.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> The theatre is closed.<br> Manners, manners.<br> Clear a path, please.<br> Please, clear a path.<br> We need to see the girls.<br> We ain't moving<br> until you open up the theatre.<br> - Open up!<br> - There's nothing I can do.<br> I see the press are here, Van Damm.<br> Yes.<br> I don't know how they got hold of it, sir.<br> - Good afternoon, Mrs Henderson.<br> - Maggie.<br> This way.<br> There seems to be a nationwide desire<br> to keep this theatre open.<br> Nationwide?<br> Please don't be delusional.<br> I have learnt in these many years<br> of dealing with artists<br> to detest imagination.<br> Excuse me.<br> Sorry.<br> This street must be clear.<br> It presents a very clear public danger.<br> I may have to ask the police<br> to interfere.<br> I'll talk to them.<br> What a commotion.<br> They think the theatre encourages<br> what they call overcongregating.<br> It seems that we're too popular.<br> What, you mean we'd stay open<br> if we were a failure? How ridiculous!<br> Listen, everybody.<br> We have no choice.<br> The government is forcing us to close.<br> One more light...<br> dimming in the heart of London.<br> He's turning into Winston again.<br> What Herr Hitler<br> was unable to do,<br> Our own leaders<br> are determined to accomplish.<br> They are going to close the Windmill!<br> Oh, really.<br> Excuse me, excuse me,<br> would you please let me through?<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me.<br> Oh, that's so kind of you. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, that's most kind, thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me. Mr Van Damm.<br> Hello, everybody.<br> Um, may I intro... Oh, hello, Tom.<br> May I introduce myself?<br> I'm Mrs Henderson.<br> You might see my name<br> on the billboard there.<br> Well, I am that Mrs Henderson,<br> and I have presented the Windmill<br> for four years now.<br> Now, let me tell you why.<br> Oh, dear, are you able to see me?<br> No...<br> Here you are, ma'am.<br> Oh, that's so sweet.<br> - Are you American?<br> - Yes.<br> Strange people, lovely manners.<br> ...there was a war before this one.<br> It was meant to end all wars.<br> I lost my son in that war.<br> My only son. Alec.<br> He was 21.<br> He perished from poison gas,<br> I believe,<br> On a field in France.<br> After - some time after - I went to<br> his room to clear away his things<br> and I discovered<br> the most amazing thing.<br> What I believe you call<br> a French postcard.<br> A photograph of a naked woman.<br> He'd been hiding it.<br> And I realised that Alec<br> had probably gone to his death<br> without ever seeing...<br> a woman naked in real life.<br> Well, I thought<br> that was the most... awful thing.<br> When you lose a son in a war,<br> you do know,<br> no matter what anyone might say,<br> that his death has been in vain.<br> It won't stop others from following.<br> Other wars, other young men.<br> Years later,<br> after my husband had died,<br> and I was on my own,<br> I decided to buy a theatre...<br> and put on a nude revue,<br> so that boys like Alec...<br> ...would never be<br> in the same predicament.<br> As long as the Windmill exists,<br> there's no need for a sad little postcard<br> stashed underneath a bed, is there?<br> Sometimes... my feelings<br> towards our young men in uniform...<br> ...have led me to foolish actions,<br> which I do, in my very soul, regret.<br> But I do know this:<br> That my desire to present this gift to<br> our young men has not been wrong.<br> If we are to ask our youth<br> to surrender their lives,<br> then we should not ask them<br> to surrender joy,<br> Or the possibility of joy.<br> And if, along the way,<br> we cause too many people<br> to congregate in the street,<br> who gives a fiddler's fuck?<br> There. I've said it.<br> Oh, dear, another air raid.<br> Don't you think everyone<br> would be so much safer inside?<br> Yes!<br> Oh, for Christ's sake, Van Damm,<br> take down that stupid sign<br> and let your public in.<br> Closed<br> We Never<br> I thought so.<br> You're going to ask me<br> to come down, aren't you?<br> I wouldn't dream of it.<br> Now you know my secrets.<br> Yes.<br> And I know none of yours.<br> No.<br> Well...<br> Actually, I think you do.<br> We have made rather a goof it,<br> haven't we?<br> Yes.<br> You're a very irritating woman but I<br> wouldn't have missed this for the world.<br> - I feel quite the same.<br> - Mm.<br> Even though you're<br> a very irritating man.<br> So, we'll continue?<br> I'm game if you are.<br> - Oh Yes<br> It passes the time of day.<br> Let's watch the rest of the show.<br> You go inside.<br> I'll stand here for a while.<br> As you wish.<br> Would you fancy a dance?<br> A dance? Where?<br> Here.<br> Won't it be dangerous?<br> You're quite right.<br> I'm a very cautious man. But...<br> it won't be dangerous. Not Tonight<br> Just one dance.<br> - Mr Van Damm.<br> - Mrs Henderson.<br> Ow! You've severed my toe.<br> - Nonsense. I didn't touch it.<br> - You're rather clumsy.<br> That's not something<br> you say to a dancing partner.<br> You should take lessons<br> before issuing an invitation.<br> I'm a very good dancer,<br> thank you very much.<br> In India only delicate men<br> are good dancers.<br> The ungainly are not so.<br> Listen, you old battleaxe...<br> Don't you dare speak to me like that.<br> Laura Henderson died in 1944. In Her will<br> she left Windmill Theatre to Vivian Van Damn.<br>
