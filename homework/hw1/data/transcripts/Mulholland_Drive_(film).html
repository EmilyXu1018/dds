You all right?<br> Dan? Dan?<br> Hello?<br> The girl is still missing.<br> Talk to me.<br> The same.<br> Oh...<br> I can't believe it!<br> It's time to say goodbye, Betty.<br> It's been so nice travelling with you.<br> Thank you, Irene.<br> I was so excited and nervous.<br> It was sure great to have you to talk to.<br> Remember I'll be watching for you on the big screen.<br> Okay Irene.<br> Won't that be the day.<br> Good luck, Betty dear.<br> Take care of yourself and be careful.<br> I will. Thanks again.<br> Betty, it was so nice meeting you<br> All the luck in the world.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Bye.<br> My bags!<br> Where to?<br> Got it!<br> Ten bucks says you're Betty.<br> Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.<br> It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?<br> Oh, in all my living glory, baby.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> - Just call me Coco.<br> Everybody else does.<br> Wait there, and I'll go get the key.<br> OK, Coco.<br> Wilkins?!<br> Wilkins?!?!<br> If that damned dog craps<br> in the courtyard one more time...<br> I'm just gonna bake his little butt for breakfast.<br> You don't have pets do you?<br> - No, I don't.<br> They're allowed,<br> I just don't like 'em here... for obvious reasons.<br> You know, there was a man that lived here once...<br> that had a prize fighting kangaroo.<br> Well, you just wouldn't believe...<br> what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.<br> Let's see your Aunt's apartment<br> ...it's a good one.<br> I can hardly wait!<br> It's unbelievable!<br> I told ya.<br> - Wow!<br> Well, you and your Aunt probably have<br> an understanding, so here's the key.<br> And if you need anything,<br> just give a holler.<br> Everybody in this building's<br> pretty much okay with me...<br> or they wouldn't be here.<br> If you like, later on<br> I'll introduce you around.<br> No hard feelings if you don't.<br> Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't tell<br> me someone was going to be here.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - It's OK<br> I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.<br> I'm sure she told you I was coming.<br> There was an accident.<br> I came here.<br> I understand.<br> I saw the dress.<br> Sorry. Are you all right?<br> What happened?<br> A car...<br> a car accident.<br> Oh... You OK?<br> I think so.<br> I was just...<br> taking a shower.<br> Oh my god. I'm sorry.<br> I'll let you get back to that.<br> I'm going to get unpacked.<br> What's your name?<br> I'm sorry. I'll get out of here<br> and we can talk later.<br> My name's...<br> Rita.<br> Hi...<br> do you work with my Aunt?<br> No... I...<br> - Sorry...<br> it's none of my business.<br> She has pretty red hair...<br> She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie...<br> that's being made in Canada...<br> but I guess you already know that.<br> I couldn't afford a place<br> like this in a million years.<br> Unless of course I'm discovered<br> and become a movie star.<br> Of course, I'd rather be known as<br> a great actress than a movie star,<br> but sometimes people end up being both<br> so that is, I guess you'd say,<br> sort of why I came here.<br> I'm sorry,<br> I'm just so excited to be here...<br> I mean I just came here from Deep River, Ontario...<br> now I'm in this...<br> dream place.<br> You can imagine how I feel.<br> Oh...

For what?<br> What is this, Ray?<br> We'd be happy to put her<br> on the list for consideration.<br> You'd be pleased to know<br> there's quite a bit of interest in this role.<br> Interest?

I got a real<br> shock to find your friend Rita here.<br> She was in the shower and I opened the door...<br> ...what do you mean?<br> ...she was in an accident.<br> ...Rita, your friend.<br> No, Coco unlocked the door.<br> ...No, she didn't see her.<br> ...she's sleeping.<br> I'm sure there's some explanation for this<br> Aunt Ruth,<br> I don't think we have to do that.<br> Please don't worry...<br> we don't need the police.<br> You're awake...<br> I think I misunderstood.<br> I thought you knew my Aunt and<br> that's why you were here.<br> I just talked to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me<br> to call the police.<br> I'm... sorry.
