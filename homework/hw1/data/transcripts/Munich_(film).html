                        Best place we went to<br> since we've been here.<br> Definitely, man.<br> Way to go, buddy.<br> Brother.<br> You guys coming back to my<br> place? All right. Let's go.<br> Hey!<br> Aw shame, shame.<br> Closing down the beer garden.<br> Hundred-meter dash powered<br> by knackwurst and lager.<br> Where are you guys from?<br> What's your event?<br> They don't speak English,<br> man.<br> Let's help them over.<br> Come on. Up?<br> Here you go.<br> Let's go.<br> I got you. Come on.<br> Up. Yeah. All right?<br> You guys take care.<br> See you.<br> Take it easy.<br> See you.<br> You're taking<br> the grade tomorrow.<br> Watch yourself, man.<br> I'm Jim McKay<br> speaking to you live...<br> at this moment,<br> from ABC headquarters...<br> just outside the Olympic<br> village in Munich, West Germany.<br> The peace of what have been<br> called the "serene Olympics"...<br> was shattered just before dawn<br> this morning, about 5.:00.<br> There is great uncertainty<br> about how many Israelis...<br> are being held hostage<br> in the apartment.<br> It now appears that Black September<br> has tossed a piece of paper...<br> out the window.<br> A list of demands.<br> They want what they call<br> "the Israeli war machine"...<br> to release 200 Arabs, which it<br> insists are political prisoners...<br> or the hostages<br> will be killed.<br> The terrorist communiqu ends<br> with an appeal...<br> for revolutionaries<br> of the world to unite.<br> McKAY: This is building<br> number 31. At this moment...<br> eight or nine terrified<br> living human beings...<br> are being held prisoner.<br> The demands have been many-<br> There's someone right now.<br> This certainly has to be<br> one of the guerrillas.<br> A man with a stocking mask<br> on his face. Weird.<br> What's going on inside<br> that head and that mind?<br> Just a short<br> while ago, there was...<br> another in this long series<br> of negotiations.<br> The spokesman for the group<br> came out, spoke, went back.<br> It seems to be a process<br> of speak and consultation.<br> McKAY: Does it mean it's all right?<br> Or does it mean it's all over?<br> Come and get us.<br> As Peter Jennings indicated,<br> the German army...<br> because of very<br> complicated laws...<br> would not be allowed<br> to participate.<br> And there you see an athlete<br> holding a canvas bag...<br> in which is obviously<br> a machine gun.<br> Peter Jennings, once again,<br> is stationed...<br> inside the Olympic village.<br> With the naked eye, Peter...<br> what do you see now?<br> Jim, there are<br> now a great many...<br> maybe a dozen already,<br> of those security men...<br> in athletic uniforms.<br> Stop!<br> It now appears that the siege<br> of the apartment building...<br> where the hostages are being<br> held has been called off...<br> and the German police<br> are retreating from the area.<br> Officials seem to have decided<br> to abandon their plans...<br> when the leader of the fedayeen<br> came out of the building...<br> and demanded<br> they call off the siege...<br> pointing out<br> that the entire operation...<br> was being watched<br> on a television set...<br> within the apartment.<br> Apparently, new demands have<br> been made to move the fedayeen...<br> and their hostages,<br> though it isn't yet known...<br> when or where<br> this might occur.<br> This is Peter.<br> Do you have something...<br> to report to us<br> from where you are?<br> This is Cosell.<br> I certainly do, Peter.<br> We have an immense flurry<br> of action here.<br> Suddenly, in the whole area between<br> building 20 and building 12...<br> they have been clearing<br> out cars.<br> Obviously wary of an assault<br> from the German police...<br> ...within<br> five minutes.<br> What I'm hearing<br> from here is that...<br> they're heading to an airport<br> called Frstenfeldbruck.<br> ...says the chopper<br> just landed...<br> at the back<br> of the Olympic village here.<br> Can you see gate number seven?<br> This is Vance Kolvig.<br> What I have seen are...<br> four hostages<br> in one helicopter...<br> and it looks like five hostages<br> in the first helicopter.<br> Yes, I just got back<br> a little while ago...<br> and it was obvious<br> that something...<br> quite serious<br> was going on out there.<br> Here we are, outside the<br> gates. There are armored cars...<br> police cars...<br> Police are pouring in through<br> the gates with lights flashing...<br> and here come some more. Five,<br> six, here comes another one.<br> Seven armored cars have gone<br> in through the gates now.<br> They're mounting<br> a major invasion.<br> The latest word we get<br> from the airport is that...<br> quote, "all hell has broken<br> loose out there. "<br> It's just arrived, Peter.<br> The bus has arrived...<br> to the helicopters.<br> We have reports now...<br> that all the hostages,<br> all nine hostages are safe.<br> We repeat, we have confirmed,<br> it's just past 1.:00 a. m.<br> The fighting ceased<br> at midnight.<br> Well, that's at least 24<br> we've seen go in...<br> and now we can see<br> the lights flashing...<br> There was a terrible battle at<br> the airport, but the hostages...<br> somehow the hostages are safe.<br> And, according to these<br> reports, all Arab terrorists...<br> have died by German gunfire.<br> Originally it was said<br> that the hostages were safe...<br> but now that has been changed.<br> An Olympic spokesman<br> said that...<br> CIOFFl: Of the areas in the<br> world, this is one of the areas...<br> They've spent their youth,<br> their young people...<br> they've spent all their money<br> on wars.<br> Now they have a chance to build<br> their nations. These nations...<br> And, of course, they're compatible.<br> The Arabs and the Israelis...<br> are perfectly compatible<br> as far as I can tell.<br> And now, as you say, Peter,<br> you're quite right.<br> They've been jolted apart<br> again, as they were...<br> seeming to come just a little<br> closer. Little hope.<br> We've just gotten the final<br> word. When I was a kid...<br> my father used to say our greatest<br> hopes and our worst fears...<br> are seldom realized. Our worst<br> fears have been realized tonight.<br> They've now said that<br> there were 11 hostages.<br> Two were killed<br> in their rooms...<br> yesterday morning.<br> Nine were killed<br> at the airport tonight.<br> They're all gone.<br> ...before a quiet<br> crowd of 80,000.<br> After the ceremony,<br> the surviving team...<br> saw the coffins<br> of their fallen comrades...<br> loaded onto an airplane<br> to bring them home together.<br> Enormous crowds also gathered<br> on Dizengoff Street...<br> and in Jerusalem on the plaza<br> in front of the Knesset.<br> People are weeping,<br> tearing their clothes.<br> The funerals, which will be<br> held tomorrow in Jerusalem...<br> are expected to draw<br> tens of thousands of mourners.<br> These are the names of the<br> members of the Israeli team...<br> at the Munich Olympics,<br> who were held hostage...<br> beaten, and finally murdered<br> by Arab terrorists.<br> Yosef Gottfreund.<br> Eliezaar Halfen.<br> Yakov Springer.<br> Dr. Wadi Haddad.<br> Abu Daoud.<br> Mahmoud Hamshari.<br> Andre Spitzer.<br> Zeev Friedman.<br> Kehat Schur.<br> Wael Zwaiter.<br> Dr. Basil al-Kubaisi.<br> Kamal Nasser.<br> Mark Slavin.<br> Amitzur Shapira.<br> David Berger.<br> Kemal Adwan.<br> Abu Youssef.<br> Mohammed Boudia.<br> Yosef Romano.<br> Moshe Weinberg.<br> Hussein al-Chir.<br> Ali Hassan Salameh.<br> As all of Israel mourns, of<br> course everyone says prayers...<br> for the people...<br> I tried not to think<br> about you, but I couldn't.<br> ...a very private, terrible grief<br> in the days and years to come.<br> I have the world's most boring<br> job. What's going to happen to me?<br> Well, they were just athletes.<br> They went to the Olympics.<br> Look what happened<br> to them.<br> What now?<br> Now we're going<br> to have a baby.<br> Eleven names.<br> Give us the order,<br> and we'll begin.<br> It's the same as Eichmann.<br> We say to these butchers:<br> "You didn't want<br> to share this world with us...<br> "then we don't have<br> to share this world with you. "<br> There's legitimacy for this.<br> Am I correct?<br> Ambushed<br> and slaughtered again...<br> while the rest of the world is<br> playing games, Olympic torches...<br> and brass bands<br> and dead Jews in Germany.<br> And the world<br> couldn't care less.<br> We've responded.<br> We sent 70 fighter jets.<br> A response no one heard.<br> Air strikes on guerrilla training<br> centers. That's a response.<br> No one notices what happens<br> in the border camps.<br> Sixty Arabs dead, at least.<br> Who knows how many wounded.<br> This is about fixing<br> the world's attention.<br> Well, it's not just<br> a publicity stunt.<br> Let me remind you.<br> Ali Hassan Salameh,<br> he invented Black September.<br> He is the architect<br> of the Munich murders.<br> These people.<br> They're sworn to destroy us.<br> Forget peace for now.<br> We have to show them<br> we're strong.<br> We have laws,<br> we represent civilization.<br> Some people say we can't<br> afford to be civilized.<br> I've always resisted<br> such people.<br> But I don't know<br> who these maniacs are...<br> and where they come from.<br> Palestinians?<br> They're not recognizable.<br> You tell me what law<br> protects people like these.<br> Today I'm hearing<br> with new ears.<br> Every civilization<br> finds it necessary...<br> to negotiate compromises<br> with its own values.<br> I've made a decision.<br> The responsibility<br> is entirely mine.<br> Avner?<br> Yes?<br> We're going to Jerusalem.<br> Get in.<br> Come on, sir.<br> Hello. I'm General Zamir.<br> Yes.<br> You swore us in.<br> My unit,<br> when I joined Mossad.<br> I don't remember you.<br> Of course, I know your father.<br> Avner.<br> It's been... Two years<br> since I worked for you.<br> I remember.<br> Please, sit down.<br> Harari.<br> General Nadav.<br> And General Yariv.<br> How are you?<br> How is your father?<br> He's fine. Thank you.<br> Coffee? It's wonderful<br> to see you again.<br> Sit.<br> The chief of the Mossad,<br> two generals...<br> and the Prime Minister.<br> Obviously, it's important.<br> This is something new.<br> What happened in Munich<br> changes everything.<br> We want to ask you. Will<br> you undertake a mission?<br> An important mission. You will<br> have to leave the country...<br> and your family,<br> maybe for years.<br> And it is dangerous. You<br> can't talk about it to anyone.<br> Not even your wife.<br> Now you should<br> say something.<br> Do you have any questions?<br> So, this isn't about guarding<br> tourists on El Al jets?<br> No questions?<br> Did we mention<br> how dangerous it is?<br> You know, my sister<br> died on Tuesday.<br> No, I didn't know that.<br> Cancer.<br> I couldn't go to the<br> athletes' funerals...<br> because she died.<br> That upset people,<br> but she was my sister.<br> Family matters.<br> Your wife is pregnant.<br> Yes, seven months.<br> Mazel tov.<br> You were one<br> of my favorite bodyguards.<br> You know,<br> I like neat, durable men.<br> You liked having<br> the son of a hero around.<br> Truth be told, you don't<br> look much like your father.<br> No?<br> Your mother<br> is who you resemble.<br> Tomorrow morning.<br> If you can't decide<br> in one day...<br> you can't decide.<br> Her sister died.<br> But I think she didn't go<br> to the athletes' funerals...<br> because some people<br> are angry at her...<br> for not negotiating<br> with the terrorists.<br> She didn't go<br> to the funerals...<br> because she didn't<br> want to be booed.<br> It's a good sign<br> you didn't ask questions.<br> You'll say yes.<br> I'm your case officer.<br> My name is Ephraim.<br> How late in the pregnancy before<br> you have to stop having sex?<br> Labor.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> You won't be around.<br> Will you?<br> Whatever they want, make<br> sure they give you a raise.<br> I need things for the baby.<br> I can't live<br> with refusing this.<br> Your mother,<br> she knew what she was doing.<br> She abandoned you on that<br> kibbutz. She didn't abandon me.<br> My father was missing.<br> He was in prison,<br> she was overwhelmed.<br> Oh, yes. She did what anybody would do.<br> Yeah, so she took you to the<br> kibbutz and abandoned you.<br> Now you think Israel<br> is your mother.<br> So listen.<br> I'm going to go along<br> with this, until I don't.<br> Do you understand me?<br> I love you.<br> I'm not the hero's nice wife.<br> First you resign from Mossad.<br> Your new contract.<br> It says we do not employ you,<br> offer you benefits, or pensions...<br> or legal aid<br> or medical assistance.<br> It's a contract<br> that there is no contract.<br> Do I get a copy?<br> You don't.<br> Your pension contribution<br> refund.<br> You're now officially<br> unofficial.<br> Unemployed and uninsured.<br> You'll open two accounts...<br> at the Union de Banques Suisse<br> in Geneva...<br> on Rue du Commerce.<br> Operational funds in one box,<br> in the other your salary...<br> which you don't take<br> till the mission ends...<br> when you get what accumulates.<br> Also, for each of your men, you<br> open an account for his salary.<br> How many men do I have for this<br> - In the operational funds box...<br> we will deposit<br> You take it out,<br> we put more in.<br> I want receipts.<br> You are not working<br> for the Baron Rothschild.<br> You're working for Israel,<br> a small country.<br> I'm an old Galicianer<br> from a mud hut in the Ukraine.<br> And I don't trust Yekke putzes<br> let loose in Europe...<br> with unlimited operational<br> expenses.<br> I was born in Israel.<br> I'm not a Yekke.<br> Where is your grandpa from?<br> Frankfurt.<br> You're a Yekke.<br> Your wife receives monthly<br> $1,000 in her bank account.<br> Also, we leave messages in the<br> box with the operational funds.<br> You can leave messages<br> for us.<br> But there shouldn't be messages.<br> I don't care about that.<br> Bring me receipts,<br> you got me? I got you.<br> Whatever you are doing,<br> somebody else is paying for it.<br> We have 11 Palestinian<br> names.<br> Each had a hand<br> in planning Munich.<br> You're going to kill them,<br> They're all in Europe now.<br> You'll stay there<br> as long as it takes.<br> Europe only, not the Arab<br> countries. That's for us, not you.<br> And not Eastern Bloc.<br> Don't upset the Russians.<br> Who needs it?<br> You'll have no contact<br> with us.<br> You're not going to give me<br> any information?<br> We deposit money from a<br> fund that doesn't exist...<br> into a box we don't know about,<br> in a bank we never set foot in.<br> We can't help you because<br> we never heard of you before.<br> You'll do what<br> the terrorists do.<br> You think they report back<br> to home base? They don't.<br> We want them dead.<br> Nothing better than eating<br> something sweet by the sea.<br> You can ask questions now.<br> Am I alone?<br> Four others.<br> They know useful things<br> like cars, documents...<br> cleanup to make sure<br> you don't...<br> accidentally<br> drop your fake passport...<br> next to the dead body.<br> You're the team leader.<br> Who kills the targets?<br> You do. Who else?<br> Use guns if you have to,<br> but the bombs are preferable.<br> One of your guys<br> knows how to make them.<br> We want everyone to read in Le Monde<br> some famous Arab terrorist is dead.<br> Who knows who blew him up?<br> Why me?<br> So what's wrong with you?<br> I'm not an experienced<br> field operative.<br> So I'm not known.<br> Not even I know you now.<br> And also, I lived in Frankfurt<br> when I was a kid...<br> so I'm a Yekke Jew who<br> knows his way around Europe.<br> That's a good reason. Here's<br> one more.

Not<br> in season, but garlic will do.<br> My papa sometimes loses<br> track of the seasons.<br> I know nothing about food.<br> Why does he make me shop?<br> You're wondering<br> if I'm French Intelligence.<br> Or CIA or KGB.<br> Or an agent with a profitable<br> sideline in information.<br> I could be anybody.<br> You could be anybody, too.<br> Identity.<br> That's the boring part now.<br> Here's what isn't boring.<br> As long as you don't work<br> for any government-<br> I'm in private business.<br> Rich Americans, I heard.<br> I'm in private business, too.<br> My family.<br> We can locate almost anyone<br> for anyone anywhere...<br> and we are ideologically<br> promiscuous.<br> We love everybody,<br> hate everybody.<br> I get my feelings confused.<br> If you're not working<br> for any government...<br> we know, or we find...<br> we don't find, you don't pay.<br> Initially it was the<br> intention of the hijackers...<br> to bring the Lufthansa to<br> Munich International Airport...<br> and then take onboard<br> the three prisoners...<br> at the end of the runway, where<br> Captain Klausen took his plane...<br> while an Arab held<br> a hand grenade at his head.<br> Hey, Avner.<br> A Lufthansa jet was hijacked<br> coming from Damascus.<br> The hijackers demanded the<br> release of three killers...<br> who survived Munich...<br> and the Germans said yes,<br> instantly.<br> The Arabs would be flown by<br> private charter plane to Zagreb.<br> Look.<br> They're free now.<br> They're in Libya.<br> No qualms about rejoicing<br> on their side, eh?<br> The Israeli kills the Arabs...<br> in Egypt, in Jordan,<br> in Lebanon, in Syria-<br> Look at them.<br> They're movie stars.<br> But did you shoot any<br> of the Israeli hostages?<br> It's not important to say<br> if I killed Israelis or not.<br> We should go to Tripoli.<br> Kill them.<br> We don't go<br> to Arab countries.<br> We stick to the names<br> we've been given.<br> Mahmoud Hamshari.<br> Do you think,<br> looking back on it now...<br> that you achieved anything<br> in the Munich operation?<br> We have made our voice heard<br> by the world.<br> Are those your words?<br> The same thing again.<br> They have made their voice heard<br> by the universe or the world...<br> who has not been hearing<br> before.<br> Well, I believe what<br> he meant by this is...<br> that now the world<br> will begin hearing us.<br> We are, for 24 years, the world's<br> largest refugee population.<br> Our homes taken from us.<br> Living in camps,<br> no future, no food.<br> Nothing decent<br> for our children.<br> And, so was the attack<br> in Munich justified?<br> The PLO condemns<br> attacks on civilians.<br> Though for 24 years...<br> Tell your newspaper that.<br> ...our civilians have been attacked<br> by the Israelis day after day-<br> Tell them about all the years<br> and years of Palestinian blood...<br> spilled by Israel.<br> And who mourns for us?<br> You know,<br> Israel just bombed...<br> two refugee camps<br> in Syria and Lebanon.<br> Tell them that-<br> Right after Munich they did<br> this. It did not begin in Munich.<br> And where does it end?<br> How will it ever end?<br> I'm sorry, I need to use your<br> phone. I need to call my editor.<br> Yes, yes. Sorry.<br> You see it. It's by<br> the window. Thank you.<br> This way, please.<br> This man, we don't know<br> what he did specifically?<br> Hamshari arranged the attempted<br> assassination of Ben-Gurion...<br> in Copenhagen<br> a few years ago.<br> Now he organizes<br> for Fatah in France.<br> He organizes?<br> Yes.<br> In Tel Aviv they showed you<br> evidence for this?<br> Not evidence.<br> It was more...<br> this is the story<br> and I believe them.<br> Why? Don't you?<br> It's a crisis, a war.<br> You don't have to always...<br> What? Be thinking?<br> Scrutinize. Yeah, think.<br> You want to wire Ephraim and<br> ask for evidence, you do it.<br> You're on your own.<br> Okay, I'm done.<br> Good.<br> Don't think about it.<br> Okay.<br> So, now, I turn it on.<br> He picks up the phone,<br> turns on the red light...<br> then I take out the key,<br> insert it...<br> and turn.<br> So now we wait<br> for the red light.<br> Is the truck blocking the signal? No.<br> Will the remote still work?<br> Yeah, it's a powerful transmitter.<br> Go back to your position.<br> You can't start improvising<br> now. Go back to your corner.<br> Don't worry. It's okay.<br> It's going to work.<br> Stop!<br> Stop!<br> Abort.<br> Are we on or off?<br> Mahmoud Hamshari?<br> Yes.<br> He's at the hospital Cochin.<br> I don't know how badly we<br> hurt him. They aren't saying.<br> Why did you put a firecracker<br> in that phone?<br> Because I didn't want<br> to blow up the building.<br> What do you want from me?<br> An Arab corpse.<br> Another $200,000, more or less,<br> to eliminate target number two.<br> Yeah, if he's been eliminated.<br> We should stick with guns.<br> No one notices a shooting.<br> Bombs achieve<br> a double objective.<br> They eliminate targets<br> and they terrify terrorists.<br> That only works<br> when the bombs work.<br> Lunch?<br> The Israeli embassy in London<br> was rocked by a letter bomb...<br> shortly after 9.:30<br> this morning.<br> Dr. Ami Shachori was opening<br> his morning mail...<br> when the envelope exploded,<br> killing him instantly.<br> They discovered seven in a mailroom<br> near the embassy in Earls Court.<br> I guess they missed one.<br> Right after Hanukkah.<br> I guess there was a big pileup<br> of mail and they got careless.<br> They found other letters<br> in Israel, of course.<br> Canada, Argentina, Vienna,<br> Kinshasa, Paris, Brussels.<br> Dozens of them, mainly posted<br> in the Netherlands.<br> It's all Black September.<br> It's a response, then.<br> To Hamshari.<br> And to Zwaiter.<br> They're talking to us.<br> We're in dialogue now.<br> Where are you?<br> I'm in New York,<br> following a lead.<br> I'll call again.<br> Are you going<br> to visit your father?<br> Why is this taking<br> so long?<br> It isn't fast.<br> We have the best hospitals<br> in the world.<br> When you were born, your father<br> was elsewhere. I was alone.<br> He was in prison.<br> Should you be here?<br> Aren't you on duty?<br> What are you going to do?<br> Turn me in?<br> How is he?<br> I don't visit<br> your father so much.<br> Wilma lets him yell at her<br> all the time.<br> She depresses me.<br> How are you?<br> I'm managing.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I'm proud<br> of what you are doing.<br> You don't know<br> what I'm doing.<br> I look at you and I know<br> everything I need to know.<br> She is frighteningly<br> ugly.<br> She takes after you.<br> I want you to move,<br> for a time.<br> I've arranged a place for us<br> in Brooklyn.<br> I can't come back to Israel.<br> I don't know how long for-<br> New York?<br> I can see more of you<br> this way. New York City?<br> But I have my family here,<br> and your parents.<br> You want my parents<br> to help raise her?<br> Look what they did to me.<br> Don't you want your daughter<br> to be an Israeli, Avner?<br> She'll always be an Israeli.<br> Not in Brooklyn. She'll<br> just be another homeless Jew.<br> I can't do what I'm doing<br> if I can't see you.<br> What are you doing?<br> Don't do it then, Avner.<br> This is our home.<br> You're the only home<br> I ever had.<br> What?<br> This is so corny.<br> It wasn't easy for<br> me to say that. I bet.<br> Don't laugh at me then.<br> Why did I have to marry<br> a sentimentalist?<br> You're ruining my life.<br> Your mother's teasing me.<br> Look at the waistline bulge<br> on that guy.<br> Look at that.<br> Think he might be armed, eh?<br> As are the Russians.<br> It's definitely him.<br> Hussein Abad al-Chir.<br> His room is next to<br> Israeli newlyweds.<br> They married in Cyprus<br> because she's not Jewish.<br> A mixed marriage.<br> A shande for the goyim.<br> Yeah, okay. But let's<br> try not to blow them up.<br> The KGB brings him home<br> every night after dark.<br> He turns on the light,<br> gets undressed...<br> turns off the light, gets<br> into bed, we blow up the bed.<br> I knew a field agent who got<br> too scared to sleep in his bed.<br> So every night he slept<br> on the floor of his closet.<br> He still does, every night.<br> Sleeps in closets.<br> Now if al-Chir sleeps in<br> his closet, we're in trouble.<br> But if he gets in the bed,<br> his weight arms the device...<br> it closes the circuit.<br> Then we hit the remote.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, we're good.<br> We're good, let's go.<br> Careful.<br> I've checked into the room<br> next door.<br> Why?<br> There are balconies.<br> When he gets into bed...<br> I give the signal<br> by switching off the light.<br> And if the bomb's too powerful<br> and you're in the next room?<br> Well, that won't happen.<br> Right?<br> Robert?<br> Robert?<br> Robert?<br> It won't. No.<br> Okay.<br> Avner.<br> Boy or girl?<br> A girl.<br> Mazel tov.<br> News from Paris.<br> Dr. Hamshari succumbed<br> to his wounds.<br> So, again, mazel tov, Avner.<br> Steve, shut up.<br> Hey.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> Beautiful night.<br> Beautiful night, yeah.<br> Where are you from? I can't place<br> - Dsseldorf.<br> Yes?<br> I wouldn't have guessed it.<br> I thought perhaps a Swede.<br> I taught in Sweden,<br> Near Eastern languages.<br> Really?<br> Teaching Lebanese immigrant<br> women how to clean houses.<br> In Swedish.<br> Were you here last night?<br> No. Just checked in.<br> Just arrived.<br> Don't plan to sleep.<br> They keep at it all night.<br> There, for hours.<br> Take a sleeping pill.<br> That's okay.<br> I can sleep through anything.<br> Are you sure?<br> You don't want to borrow<br> one of mine?<br> Thank you very much. It's okay. Really?<br> Yes.<br> So, good night.<br> Pleasant dreams.<br> Wait for the signal.<br> Wait for Avner's light<br> to go out.<br> Go! Go! Go!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Help!<br> Oh, my eyes.<br> My eyes, I can't see.<br> Can someone help me?<br> I can't see.<br> Avner!<br> Please! Oh, my God!<br> I can't see.<br> Can you see?<br> Yes.<br> The stairs are that way.<br> Okay.<br> Go that way.<br> Come on. Let's go!<br> It was much too powerful.<br> Stop it.<br> You could've blown up innocent<br> - Target number three.<br> Target number three<br> was not in doubt.<br> The ceiling in the lobby<br> cracked. You nearly demolished...<br> Avner might have been killed.<br> The plastique was not<br> what I asked for.<br> It couldn't have been<br> the grade I specified.<br> Someone changed the marking<br> on the explosive.<br> What if someone changed<br> the marking?<br> What do you mean?<br> Louis provided the plastique.<br> Avner, Louis provided<br> the explosives?<br> Yes. Why?<br> Why are we trusting him?<br> We have no idea who he is.<br> He's finding our targets.<br> Yes, but-<br> But without him,<br> we'd be nowhere on this!<br> The plastique was much more<br> powerful than what I asked for.<br> Someone changed the label.<br> I could have killed you.<br> For all we know,<br> Louis works for the PLO.<br> They're using us to do<br> internal housecleaning.<br> That's bullshit.<br> Hey,<br> whose fishing boat is this?<br> Louis arranged it.<br> There was nothing wrong<br> with the explosive.<br> Bomb makers are nervous,<br> which is understandable.<br> Fear makes them sloppy-<br> There's nothing wrong<br> with my bomb maker.<br> It's your explosives.<br> We found three more<br> names for you.<br> Three?<br> Yes, three.<br> Thought you'd be pleased.<br> I am.<br> Who?<br> Kemal Adwan, Kamal Nasser,<br> and Abu Youssef.<br> Adwan and Abu Youssef.<br> Where?<br> Lebanon.<br> They're in Beirut.<br> Adwan, Nasser, Youssef.<br> Serious characters, huh?<br> Extremely serious.<br> Smile, Mr. Storsch.<br> It's a second Christmas.<br> I'd like to pay you<br> a little extra for this.<br> These three names.<br> $600,000.<br> Monsieur Storsch, my group...<br> we don't care much<br> for governments...<br> any governments.<br> We don't work with<br> or for them.<br> That's an absolute condition<br> of my theory.<br> You understand?<br> If I learn that your sudden<br> generosity was an attempt...<br> to buy our acquiescence in<br> your sharing my information...<br> with, let us say,<br> CIA or Ml6 or Mossad-<br> I don't work for Ml6 or CIA<br> - You have no idea who you work for.<br> Trust me. You don't.<br> Lie to me and you will find me<br> abruptly unreachable...<br> and unhappy.<br> Let me buy you a drink.<br> No. You save your money.<br> At these prices,<br> you're going to need it.<br> It's obviously<br> significant information.<br> Abu Youssef is like number three<br> in the whole Palestinian network.<br> It's like Arafat, Habash,<br> and then him.<br> Of course he's significant.<br> Thanks for the instruction...<br> and enthusiasm. He's the<br> brains of the fedayeen.<br> I know who he is.<br> Next to Salameh...<br> Abu Youssef is the worst guy<br> we're after, right?<br> And Adwan, he plans all the<br> actions in the West Bank, right?<br> We get the significance.<br> These are serious targets.<br> We want to go to Beirut.<br> No.<br> You keep away<br> from the Arab countries.<br> Mossad and the army<br> will take care of it.<br> What is this contraption?<br> You can't send the army.<br> We won't allow it.<br> You won't allow it?<br> Our source doesn't know<br> we're Mossad.<br> You aren't Mossad.<br> If commandos go to Beirut,<br> our source will cut us off.<br> Why don't you and I go for a<br> walk and talk about this, alone?<br> The food will get cold.<br> We have to go to Beirut.<br> We're good at this.<br> This is our information,<br> this is our job.<br> That's touching<br> in a juvenile sort of way.<br> Listen.<br> You're doing reasonably well.<br> Reasonably? You're<br> spending a lot of money.<br> Well, we expected that.<br> Lots of people in Mossad<br> don't know about you.<br> No one knows.<br> So everyone's asking,<br> "Who's killing the fedayeen?<br> "Is it our guys?<br> Why weren't we told?"<br> Big egos. Lots of screaming.<br> I can maybe include<br> one or two of you...<br> but excluding Mossad<br> or the army is impossible.<br> Accept it.<br> We will,<br> but our source won't.<br> Who is your source?<br> It's time you told me.<br> That, by the way, is not<br> a request. It's an order.<br> You can't order him.<br> He doesn't work for you.<br> Shut up. I pay you.<br> You work for me.<br> I work for a metal box in a<br> bank in Geneva. The box pays me.<br> You want to find it empty? I<br> want you to let us do our work!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> With all of you?<br> Grow up and do it quick.<br> This is not a game,<br> a fucking game.<br> Who has the source? Where are<br> you getting your information?<br> Give me his goddamn number!<br> I hope the old lady next door<br> enjoyed that.<br> She's a little deaf but I doubt<br> she had any trouble hearing you.<br> Give me the source<br> and we'll let you take part.<br> Let us go to Beirut.<br> After Beirut, we'll use our source<br> to find the remaining targets.<br> Let us do our job.<br> A lot of manpower<br> to shoot three guys.<br> Ehud Barak.<br> Daniel.<br> Go!<br> Where the fuck is he?<br> Door!<br> Let's go!<br> Go!<br> Go! Go!<br> Go!<br> It's him!<br> Don't shoot! No!<br> Fedayeen!<br> Go!<br> My papa would like to meet you. Papa?<br> My papa.<br> He runs our little group.<br> I thought you ran the group.<br> Everybody works for someone.<br> I wasn't in Beirut.<br> Well, someone was there.<br> The Israeli army, according<br> to every newspaper on Earth.<br> But you stayed away...<br> after you paid so extravagantly<br> for the information.<br> I don't like to keep<br> my papa waiting.<br> I need to tell my people<br> where I'm going.<br> You don't know<br> where you're going.<br> And you'll need<br> to wear this.<br> Forget it, Louis.<br> That's just crazy.<br> We're done here.<br> Shit.<br> Wait!<br> Wait!<br> We're here.<br> Papa!<br> He's over there.<br> Louis says you're a cook.<br> I know how to cook, yeah.<br> You help me?<br> Bring these there.<br> No, no. Don't wash. No, no. They<br> will taste like boiled sponge.<br> But then why put them<br> in the sink?<br> If the juices spurt out,<br> it's a big mess.<br> The whole kitchen<br> will smell like piss.<br> Peel off the fat.<br> Let me see your hands.<br> Too big for a good cook.<br> That was my problem, too.<br> I had been a master...<br> but I have thick, stupid,<br> butcher's hands just like yours.<br> Well, we are tragic men.<br> Butcher's hands, gentle souls.<br> These are going to be<br> too sour to eat.<br> Skin them and prick them,<br> boil them in sugar.<br> A little torture, and<br> you'll see how nice they are.<br> You call me "Papa. "<br> I can't do that.<br> No?<br> I have a papa already.<br> You are devoted to him?<br> Am I here because of<br> what happened in Beirut?<br> Your papa must be<br> proud of his son.<br> We'll pick a few.<br> Let the rest ripen.<br> There are so many people<br> to feed, but-<br> But they are your family.<br> So you have to feed them.<br> Yes. We don't work<br> with governments.<br> Louis said. But...<br> But you did what you did because<br> you have to feed your family.<br> I blew up trains,<br> bridges...<br> and trucks full of Germans<br> during the war.<br> My brothers were killed, my papa<br> and my sister were both hanged.<br> She was a young girl.<br> Papa, the guest doesn't<br> want to hear your war stories.<br> We paid this price, so Vichy<br> scum could be replaced...<br> by Gaullist scum...<br> and the Nazis could be<br> replaced by Stalin and America.<br> We stay away<br> from governments.<br> We say grace?<br> Maybe our guest<br> could lead us.<br> No, no, no.<br> It's not required.<br> Our Father, who gives us<br> obedient and respectful clients...<br> who obey the rules according<br> to which our business thrives-<br> ...whose prevarications<br> and deceptions-<br> In my despair<br> I fathered madmen...<br> who dress like factory workers,<br> but never do manual labor...<br> and who read nonsense<br> and spout pompous bullshit...<br> about Algerians<br> and who love nothing...<br> not Algerians or French...<br> or flesh and blood,<br> or anything living.<br> So I have sympathy for a man<br> who can say, "I have a papa"...<br> and who does what he must<br> for his family.<br> I will say grace.<br> There's some opinion<br> you should be punished...<br> for what happened<br> in Beirut.<br> We didn't know<br> so many would die.<br> I'm in business with death.<br> Do you think I'm squeamish?<br> The world has been rough<br> with you, with your tribe.<br> It's right to respond roughly<br> to such treatment.<br> You pay well and you pay promptly,<br> so we'll continue together.<br> But no more infractions.<br> Thank you. You have my word.<br> A few andouillettes<br> and boudins noirs...<br> black blood sausage and a<br> Loire cheese, Selles-sur-Cher.<br> We cover it in ash to<br> preserve it. Thank you.<br> You could have been my son.<br> But you're not.<br> Remember that.<br> We'll do business,<br> but you aren't family.<br> I have a new name for you.<br> I want Ali Hassan Salameh.<br> No.<br> You know where he is. You<br> know where all the names are.<br> Salameh.<br> Untouchable.<br> Salameh.<br> Zaid Muchassi.<br> Zaid Muchassi is in Athens<br> in two weeks.<br> Not one of our names.<br> Nevertheless.<br> He is Black September's<br> KGB contact.<br> Hussein al-Chir<br> was the KGB contact.<br> Yes. But you put a bomb under<br> Monsieur al-Chir's bed in Cyprus...<br> and now he's defunct.<br> Muchassi is his replacement.<br> I hear he's much tougher<br> than his predecessor.<br> We offer Muchassi's<br> whereabouts at the new rate.<br> What new rate?<br> Three names for $600,000...<br> is $200,000 for one name.<br> I need you to find me<br> a place to work in Athens.<br> Of course. Safe house.<br> Is this Louis's idea<br> of a joke?<br> I've had nightmares<br> that looked like this.<br> So when they explode, they toss<br> little white balls of phosphorus...<br> here all around his room. Each<br> ball, it's like a little sun.<br> It burns at around<br> So the air catches fire.<br> Everything in the vicinity<br> melts.<br> Now, the bad news is<br> they are grenades...<br> so I modified them to use<br> with a remote detonator.<br> I also should mention<br> that they're quite old...<br> like World War II.<br> Only four were viable.<br> We should dump the rest.<br> There's a porter at the hotel<br> where Muchassi's staying.<br> He's gonna let us in the room<br> when Muchassi goes out.<br> Hey. Who provided these<br> prehistoric explosives?<br> Louis.<br> Yeah. I'll thank him for that.<br> Tallyho.<br> Stop! Stop!<br> PLO! PLO!<br> ETA! ETA!<br> Put the gun down<br> or we'll shoot.<br> Basque! Basque!<br> Okay.<br> Put the gun down!<br> Put it down!<br> Put it down.<br> Which French? Louis?<br> Who are you? English?<br> Basque. ETA.<br> Red Army Faction.<br> He's ANC.<br> African. African.<br> We are from Amman.<br> I'm Ali.<br> Said. George. Abed.<br> We paid for two nights.<br> He said it was safe.<br> He told us the same.<br> Yes. Safe house.<br> Yes.<br> So we're safe?<br> Safe.<br> Everyone is safe.<br> Eventually the Arab states<br> will rise against Israel.<br> They don't like Palestinians,<br> but they hate the Jews more.<br> It won't be like 1967.<br> The rest of the world will see by<br> then what the Israelis do to us.<br> They won't help when Egypt<br> and Syria attack. Even Jordan.<br> Israel will cease<br> to exist.<br> What?<br> This is a dream. You can't take<br> back a country you never had.<br> You sound like a Jew.<br> Fuck you.<br> I'm the voice inside your head<br> telling you what you already know.<br> You people have nothing<br> to bargain with.<br> You'll never get<br> the land back.<br> You'll all die old men in refugee<br> camps waiting for Palestine.<br> We have a lot of children.<br> They'll have children.<br> So we can wait forever.<br> And if we need to, we can make<br> the whole planet unsafe for Jews.<br> You kill Jews and the world<br> feels bad for them...<br> and thinks you are animals.<br> Yes.<br> But then the world will see how<br> they've made us into animals.<br> They'll start to ask questions<br> about the conditions in our cages.<br> You are Arabs. There are lots<br> of places for Arabs.<br> You're a Jew sympathizer.<br> All you Germans,<br> you're too soft on Israel.<br> Well, you give us money, but<br> you feel guilty about Hitler.<br> And the Jews exploit<br> that guilt.<br> My father didn't gas<br> any Jews.<br> Tell me something, Ali.<br> What?<br> Do you really miss<br> your father's olive trees?<br> Do you honestly think you have to<br> get back all that... that nothing?<br> That chalky soil<br> and stone huts.<br> Is that what you really<br> want for your children?<br> It absolutely is.<br> It will take a hundred years,<br> but we'll win.<br> How long did it take the Jews<br> to get their own country?<br> How long did it take<br> the Germans to make Germany?<br> And look how well<br> that worked out.<br> You don't know what it is<br> not to have a home.<br> That's why you European Reds<br> don't get it.<br> You say, "It's nothing," but<br> you have a home to come back to.<br> ETA, ANC, IRA...<br> we all pretend we care about<br> your international revolution...<br> but we don't care.<br> We want to be nations.<br> Home is everything.<br> No, no, no.<br> No, I watch.<br> You only take money<br> enclosed in papers, yes?<br> Of course.<br> Look there.<br> Here they come<br> in their pumpkin coach.<br> The Russians and...<br> Cinderella.<br> Do we detonate if the other<br> Arabs go into the room with him?<br> Why are the Russians waiting?<br> Why don't they leave?<br> They are waiting.<br> We are waiting. Stay calm.<br> Hey, I'm calm.<br> He's in his room. Do it.<br> Is he alone?<br> How do we know if he's alone?<br> Just flip the switch. Do it.<br> I don't understand it.<br> What's wrong?<br> It's a piece of shit.<br> What? Fuck! Not again.<br> Wait, wait.<br> Where's the explosion?<br> It should've exploded by now.<br> What's gone wrong?<br> It's another malfunction.<br> You know what?<br> Or maybe it's delayed-<br> He has fucked up again!<br> Or maybe it could still blow<br> up. This is a waste of time!<br> Careful with that stuff,<br> Hans.<br> Hans!<br> Hans, what are you doing?<br> Hans, get back here!<br> Hey, hey!<br> What is he doing?<br> Hans. No, no.<br> So how long<br> is he going to be?<br> Maybe one hour.<br> I know you.<br> Stop!<br> Get in! Head down!<br> Ali? Ali? Ali?<br> Are you incapable of making<br> something that works?<br> Shut up! You shut up!<br> Does anybody speak Greek?<br> Shut him up!<br> Did we kill a Russian?<br> That's not good! Where<br> did you get your training?<br> Every single bomb, every<br> fucking one, is fucked up.<br> I was not trained to do this!<br> I was trained to dismantle<br> bombs, not to build them!<br> Holy shit.<br> Shin Bet wanted bomb dismantlers.<br> They picked me from the army.<br> A toy maker.<br> Give me some money.<br> They figured I was good<br> with small machines.<br> But then after Munich, they asked<br> if I could build bombs instead.<br> So I said yes.<br> Come on. Here.<br> The three went to the<br> side of the customs hall...<br> took out pieces of their rifles,<br> and quickly assembled them.<br> Then they threw hand grenades into<br> the long queues of passengers...<br> waiting to clear passport<br> control and began automatic fire.<br> It was all over<br> in a matter of minutes.<br> And the firing<br> was indiscriminate.<br> Salameh is in London.<br> He goes there periodically<br> to meet with his CIA contact.<br> His what?<br> Salameh works for the CIA.<br> Bullshit.<br> Salameh guarantees<br> that Black September...<br> won't touch<br> American diplomats.<br> In exchange, the CIA<br> gives him lots of money.<br> And they don't ask<br> what he uses it for.<br> Did he tell them<br> about Munich in advance?<br> Did the CIA<br> know about Munich?<br> The CIA didn't even know<br> Black September existed...<br> before Munich.<br> One of the guerrillas was shot<br> through the head...<br> by a ricochet bullet.<br> A second was blown up<br> by his own hand grenade.<br> Since then,<br> he's been busy.<br> Hasn't he?<br> All manner<br> of costly exercises.<br> Shooting tourists<br> in the Athens airport...<br> blowing up pharmacies<br> in Amsterdam...<br> and that Mossad agent<br> in Barcelona before that.<br> Europe hasn't been this interesting<br> since Napoleon marched to Moscow.<br> Do you have to<br> do that here?<br> Salameh is in London.<br> For the usual price.<br> We followed him from<br> his doctor to his hotel.<br> He's here for eye treatment.<br> Salameh. You saw him?<br> You followed him?<br> Yes.<br> Wearing sunglasses in the<br> rain. Why didn't you shoot him?<br> There were bodyguards.<br> Civilians.<br> Were they armed?<br> Yes.<br> Well then, they're not<br> civilians. I'd have done it...<br> if you'd give me half a chance<br> to actually shoot someone.<br> I'm the only one who actually<br> wants to shoot these guys.<br> Maybe that's why<br> we never let you do it.<br> We only go after our targets.<br> Since when?<br> I mean, why are we worried<br> about that now?<br> Do you have any idea<br> how many laws we've broken?<br> It's time to stop your<br> agonizing. It's counterproductive.<br> Including, incidentally, the<br> laws of the state of Israel...<br> which has no death penalty.<br> You know what your problem is,<br> habibi?<br> You're disorientated.<br> Because the guys we're killing<br> are dressed in expensive suits...<br> and this is London and<br> not some ugly Arab village.<br> I'm not disoriented.<br> I'm keeping my sanity by<br> occasionally reminding myself...<br> that in spite of-<br> But it's the same old war<br> we're fighting...<br> I'm still, at least in<br> principle, a human being.<br> ...over the same old<br> scrap of desert!<br> It's just we've brought our war<br> to Copenhagen and Kensington...<br> and it's not like these European<br> anti-Semites don't deserve that.<br> Unless we learn to act like<br> them, we will never defeat them.<br> We act like them<br> all the time.<br> What, you think the<br> Palestinians invented bloodshed?<br> How do you think we got control<br> of the land? By being nice?<br> Somebody pull down this man's<br> pants. See if he's circumcised.<br> I think we have a double agent<br> in our midst.<br> Don't you dare accuse<br> me of that! Stop it!<br> My son died in '67, you<br> foul-mouthed son of a bitch.<br> Everything you can ask,<br> I've done for Israel.<br> Ask for a reassignment<br> if this is so distasteful.<br> Why, it's not distasteful to you? No.<br> 'Cause the only blood that<br> matters to me is Jewish blood.<br> Nice job, eh.<br> Nice job leading.<br> If the bodyguards are armed,<br> we kill them.<br> They're armed.<br> Well, then we kill them!<br> Taxi!<br> Taxi!<br> Roger Burke, you ugly fuck!<br> What are you doing in London?<br> Get your hands off me.<br> Put them up. Put them<br> up, you fat, wet puss!<br> Let's show these limey fucks<br> what we're made of.<br> Hey, wait a minute! Who the fuck...<br> Who do you think this is then?<br> Roger Burke.<br> Who do you think this is?<br> No, you idiot. That is not-<br> Lay off him, asshole.<br> That's not him. Come on.<br> It's Roger Burke.<br> I'm sorry about my friend,<br> you know?<br> He's a fucked-up, belligerent guy<br> with a serious drinking problem.<br> Hey, come here.<br> Lose it.<br> Come on. Calm down!<br> Hey, calm down.<br> Hey, come here!<br> Calm down!<br> Back off. Get back!<br> Back off! Back off!<br> Fuck off!<br> It's me. All right!<br> All right. Come on.<br> Fuck off!<br> It's me, Roger, Orrin!<br> Come on.<br> It's me. Remember me? Sorry.<br> It's all right.<br> You should have ducked,<br> Roger!<br> Fucking Americans!<br> What the fuck is that?<br> Was it Salameh?<br> Yes, of course<br> it was fucking Salameh!<br> I take it she'd<br> eat you up a bit, huh?<br> You old dog.<br> He's got some ideas.<br> Oh, the American bloke?<br> Aren't we all?<br> So you've heard these rumors?<br> These are wild stories.<br> Wild stories.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah.<br> Can I?<br> I have to go to bed soon.<br> I work in the morning.<br> What kind of work do you do?<br> The kind that drives you<br> to drink.<br> We must have the same job,<br> then.<br> I love your accent.<br> I love your perfume.<br> Cuts right through<br> the smoke.<br> Does it?<br> It's very nice.<br> Look, I don't want<br> to be forward...<br> but it's late...<br> and I do have to get up early.<br> So...<br> So?<br> So...<br> So, you're very nice, and...<br> Are you really going<br> to make me ask?<br> I just can't.<br> Pity.<br> You're very attractive.<br> I know.<br> If you come to your senses...<br> once you get up<br> to your lonely room...<br> well, maybe I'll be here.<br> Or maybe I'll be in my room,<br> alone in bed.<br> Good night.<br> The drunk Americans.<br> You think they were CIA?<br> They could've been.<br> For all we know, Louis is CIA.<br> They work both sides.<br> Everyone does.<br> Or Louis is Mossad.<br> Now, maybe he isn't...<br> but they're using him<br> to feed us information.<br> There's no direct link.<br> Or Mossad's giving it to CIA,<br> which is giving it to Louis...<br> and Ephraim's demanding<br> we give him Louis...<br> because he knows<br> we expect him to do-<br> Stop chasing the mice<br> inside your skull.<br> You know,<br> I never thought you'd last.<br> I thought the same about you.<br> From the beginning<br> you seemed so reluctant.<br> I was born reluctant.<br> Ask my mother.<br> If I can't kvetch,<br> I can't do my job.<br> You ever feel reluctant?<br> I'm not comfortable<br> with confusion.<br> I knew guys like you<br> in the army.<br> You'll do any terrifying thing<br> you're asked to do...<br> but you have to do it running.<br> You think you can outrun<br> your fears, your doubts.<br> The only thing that really<br> scares you guys is stillness.<br> But everyone's overtaken,<br> eventually.<br> Now, the mice need a brandy.<br> Will you join me?<br> No, I'm going to go upstairs,<br> straight to bed.<br> You okay drinking<br> by yourself?<br> It's just a shot to numb<br> the brain. Good night.<br> Oh.<br> Beware of the local honey trap. Indeed?<br> You can't miss her.<br> You don't want to.<br> Hello.<br> This is a trunk call<br> from Mr. Storsch.<br> Do you accept the charges?<br> Shit, Avner, you woke up the<br> baby, but that's okay... I mean...<br> How are you?<br> I miss you.<br> You're in England<br> or Australia...<br> or the North Pole-<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> So listen, I was thinking...<br> when I'm finished doing<br> what I'm doing here...<br> I want to come to Brooklyn<br> to see you.<br> Brooklyn is depressing. It's<br> got more churches than Jerusalem.<br> Listen to her talk.<br> Can you hear me? Can<br> she hear me? Yeah, yeah.<br> Hey. Talk to me.<br> Daphna, make her talk.<br> Dada.<br> Hey. Hey, sweetheart. It's your papa.<br> This is my voice, darling.<br> This is what I sound like.<br> Don't forget, okay?<br> Listen, I have to get<br> her to bed. She's tired.<br> She'll dream about you.<br> We're standing at a distance,<br> as instructed by the terrorists.<br> Are we going?<br> Is it to the airport?<br> Can we talk to someone,<br> just to say-<br> Shut up, okay?<br> Just get on the bus, okay?<br> Just to tell our families.<br> Just to say we are all right!<br> Everybody, just relax, okay?<br> Relax! Calm down.<br> We will ride this bus and fly away.<br> After, you go back to your home...<br> or to your Olympic Games.<br> Carl. You asshole.<br> I saw her first.<br> Carl?<br> She's Dutch, not political,<br> entirely business-minded.<br> She lives in Hoorn.<br> She's there now.<br> This is dependable<br> information.<br> For which you pay nothing.<br> We're giving you this.<br> You understand why?<br> Because you want me to believe<br> that you had nothing to do...<br> with the murder of my partner.<br> We inhabit a world<br> of intersecting secrecies.<br> We live and die at the places<br> where those secrecies meet.<br> That's what we accept.<br> We buy information for you<br> from your enemies.<br> This alerts them.<br> You're not the only people<br> looking for names.<br> You're telling me<br> I'm being hunted now?<br> He's telling you<br> it's time for you to quit.<br> The race is not to the swift,<br> nor the battle to the strong...<br> but time and chance<br> happens to them all.<br> Evil falls suddenly.<br> Who can say when it falls?<br> So you're really gonna<br> kill her?<br> All this blood comes back to<br> us. Eventually it will work.<br> Even if it takes years,<br> we'll beat them.<br> We're Jews, Avner.<br> Jews don't do wrong<br> because our enemies do wrong.<br> We can't afford to be<br> that decent anymore.<br> I don't know that<br> we ever were that decent.<br> Suffering thousands of years of<br> hatred doesn't make you decent.<br> But we're supposed to be<br> righteous. That's a beautiful thing.<br> That's Jewish.<br> That's what I knew,<br> that's what I was taught.<br> And now I'm losing it,<br> and I lose that, that's-<br> That's-<br> That's everything.<br> That's my soul.<br> You need to go rest somewhere.<br> You don't have to do this one.<br> When I need you again,<br> I'll find you.<br> Excuse me. Who are you?<br> Do you know why we're here?<br> I want to get dressed, okay?<br> Maybe you want to hire me.<br> You know how good I am.<br> No. Don't.<br> It's such a fucking waste<br> of talent.<br> Where're you going?<br> Stay here.<br> Shell. Shell.<br> Yeah.<br> Leave it.<br> In seven months we've<br> killed six of the 11 names.<br> We've killed one replacement.<br> One of our targets<br> is in prison and four...<br> including Ali Hassan Salameh,<br> are at large.<br> One of our own has fallen.<br> Since we began, the other side has<br> sent letter bombs to 11 embassies...<br> hijacked three planes...<br> killed 130 passengers in Athens<br> and wounded scores more...<br> and killed our military<br> attach in Washington.<br> Some of it was done by a Venezuelan<br> called Carlos the Jackal...<br> who replaced Zaid Muchassi...<br> who replaced Hussein al-Chir.<br> Black September's original<br> leadership has been decimated.<br> But new leaders<br> are emerging...<br> for whom Black September<br> wasn't violent enough.<br> And to dispatch<br> our six dispatched targets...<br> we must have spent something<br> close to $2 million, right?<br> You've been cooking.<br> Are you expecting company?<br> Mrs. Meir<br> says to the Knesset...<br> the world must see<br> that killing Jews...<br> will be from now on<br> an expensive proposition.<br> But killing Palestinians<br> isn't exactly cheap.<br> If all 11 were dead, you'd stop? Yes.<br> You're lying.<br> What about their replacements?<br> With each time we kill,<br> we create six more.<br> Maybe they'll have to keep<br> killing them, then.<br> Forever.<br> Five targets are still alive.<br> That's five men<br> that need to be killed.<br> Eventually you forget that in<br> the beginning you hated doing it.<br> For me personally,<br> I feel less every day.<br> One day I'm going to wake up,<br> I'm going to kill...<br> I'm going to go back to bed, I'm<br> not going to feel anything at all.<br> Hey, Hans? You know there's a rule<br> in the book against blind drunks.<br> Why don't you stop drinking<br> and eat something?<br> I mean, there's enough food<br> here to feed Bangladesh.<br> I keep seeing that Dutch woman,<br> you know, sprawled out like that.<br> It's not that I wish<br> we hadn't killed her.<br> I wish I had let you<br> close up her housecoat.<br> Yeah,<br> but you weren't yourself.<br> Avner.<br> Avner.<br> Avner.<br> I went to Hans' flat<br> above the antique shop...<br> just to check up on him<br> because he was so...<br> Anyway, he's gone somewhere,<br> and I waited all night...<br> and he's not come back.<br> Knife.<br> They didn't take anything.<br> What?<br> It will be beautiful.<br> Ali Hassan Salameh is in<br> Tarifa on the Spanish coast.<br> He's at a compound guarded by<br> all the predictable trouble.<br> Bomb makers often die<br> accidental deaths.<br> In Athens<br> you shot a KGB agent.<br> Many people must want<br> to kill you, Monsieur Storsch.<br> But why would I do that?<br> You pay better than anyone.<br> It's dangerous<br> going after Salameh.<br> But he planned<br> the Munich massacre.<br> Eliminate him, and they'll let<br> you go home. Don't you think?<br> Yes, Louis. I do.<br> You could have a kitchen<br> like that someday.<br> It costs dearly,<br> but home always does.<br> Shit!<br> It's like a funhouse in there.<br> Can you tell how many?<br> That's him.<br> Are you sure it's him, Avner?<br> You have to be sure.<br> I'm Avner Kaufman.<br> We know.<br> You want to ride with us?<br> Hop in.<br> Please.<br> I'm Amos.<br> This is Avi. Shin Bet.<br> We're not supposed to know<br> who you are...<br> because we're not officers.<br> We're just shit<br> and no one tells us shit.<br> We've heard about<br> what you've done.<br> We want to say it's<br> an honor to meet you.<br> It's an honor for me,<br> too.<br> I have no problems<br> with anything you guys did...<br> except the woman on<br> the houseboat in Hoorn.<br> Steve's told us about her.<br> We took a leave<br> of absence...<br> and killed her<br> off the company clock.<br> Don't be an idiot.<br> Otherwise, as I said, we have<br> no problems with the job you did.<br> Except three<br> of my men died.<br> According<br> to your colleague...<br> I should say, emphatically,<br> according to your colleague...<br> not in any way your fault.<br> He sings your praises.<br> Best guy he ever worked for,<br> and so on.<br> He says this French group...<br> Louis was his name?<br> They sold the terrorists information<br> regarding your whereabouts.<br> They helped kill your men.<br> I know Steve believes that,<br> but it's not true.<br> Tell us who they are.<br> They won't work with you.<br> It's about loyalty.<br> You're an Israeli officer.<br> That's your only loyalty!<br> That's it!<br> Okay.<br> This is General Hofi<br> of the Northern Command.<br> You look good.<br> Listen, the Prime Minister<br> is proud of you and your men.<br> She wishes she could tell you<br> herself, but she can't.<br> She never heard of you,<br> right?<br> Good. She says you've done<br> a great thing for your people.<br> For Israel.<br> That's it.<br> There is no medal or anything.<br> June 16, 1973.<br> Avner Kaufman interview.<br> Go ahead.<br> Tell me what you learned.<br> What I learned?<br> Yes.<br> What did you learn?<br> For God's sake!<br> Tell me the names and numbers<br> of your sources.<br> Avner, tell me.<br> Tell me the names and numbers<br> of your sources.<br> Please.<br> I can have you<br> court-martialed, and I might.<br> You can't.<br> I don't work for you.<br> I don't exist.<br> You look terrible.<br> I'm not good right now.<br> You don't need to tell me<br> anything. It's taken a lot from you.<br> I'm alive, right? And<br> the rest sorts itself out.<br> I'm not a fool, Avner. I<br> never said you were a fool.<br> Everyone in Europe died.<br> Most of my family.<br> A huge family.<br> I never talked<br> to you about it.<br> I knew. You knew? So<br> what was there to say?<br> I didn't die,<br> because I came here.<br> When I arrived, I walked up to<br> the top of a hill in Jerusalem...<br> and prayed for a child.<br> I never prayed before,<br> but I was praying then.<br> And I could feel every<br> one of them praying with me.<br> You are what we prayed for.<br> What you did,<br> you did for us.<br> You did for your daughter,<br> but also for us.<br> Every one of the ones<br> who died, died wanting this.<br> We had to take it, because no<br> one will ever give it to us.<br> A place to be a Jew among<br> Jews, subject to no one.<br> I thank God for hearing<br> my prayer.<br> Do you want to know, Mama?<br> Do you want me to tell you<br> what I did?<br> No.<br> Whatever it took,<br> whatever it takes.<br> A place on Earth.<br> We have a place on Earth.<br> At last.<br> What's this?<br> Baklava.<br> From Rehovot? The only edible<br> baklava is from the Arabs in Jaffa.<br> Eat it on the plane.<br> You're too thin.<br> I hope it gives you<br> a bellyache.<br> Listen, forget it.<br> You go see your wife, your<br> child, rest for a few more months.<br> Then we're gonna put you<br> back in the field.<br> Not Europe.<br> Probably Latin America.<br> You think it over. Rest,<br> Avner. Then you come back.<br> No.<br> That's all right.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> Look at that beautiful hair.<br> Nightmares?<br> Yes.<br> Come back to bed.<br> I have no idea<br> where I should be.<br> The place is nice.<br> You've made it really nice.<br> The kitchen's too big.<br> Sylvie, I need to speak<br> to your father.<br> Is Louis there?<br> I need to speak to your<br> father. Have him call me.<br> I'll wait. He must call me.<br> I'll wait.<br> Am I being hunted?<br> Is my family being hunted?<br> How is your father? He's<br> well? Your family is well?<br> I don't know. How is my<br> family? Are they well?<br> Are they going to be okay?<br> I'm sending you a parcel<br> of sausage and cheese.<br> Real cheese. The kind<br> you can't find in America.<br> It isn't pasteurized,<br> so it won't taste like shit.<br> It's a real pleasure<br> to hear your voice again.<br> I think about you<br> with concern.<br> Do you believe me?<br> Avner?<br> You believe me, Avner?<br> You know my name?<br> Of course I do.<br> Now, listen to me.<br> It's important.<br> No harm will come to you<br> from me.<br> You can't go in there, sir.<br> It's a restricted area.
