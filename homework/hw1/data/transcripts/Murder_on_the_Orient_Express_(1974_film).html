Madame, lucky tooth<br> from St. Augustine of Hippo.<br> - Lucky Buddha, Madame?<br> - Madame, lucky Buddha.<br> Thank God, my St. Christopher.<br> St. Christopher.<br> You see, my friend has been<br> urgently called to London<br> on a matter of<br> international importance,<br> and I have given him my<br> personal assurance<br> that you will secure an accommodation<br> for him on the coach to Calais.<br> - But, Signor Bianchi, I have already...<br> - Hector...<br> Excuse me, excuse me, gentlemen,<br> but Mr. Ratchett has reservations,<br> and we'd be grateful if we could<br> board immediately.<br> Mr. Ratchett.<br> Welcome to the number ten.<br> Mr. Beddoes, the lower berth<br> in number one.<br> Mr. McQueen, the lower berth<br> in number four.<br> - The upper berth is...<br> - As arranged.<br> Now, Pierre, it is cold.<br> Now we can place Monsieur<br> Poirot in the number 16,<br> which is always kept vacant.<br> It is taken, signor, by a Mr. Hardman.<br> Then as a director of the line,<br> I command you to place<br> Monsieur Poirot<br> in what we know to be the empty berth<br> above Mr. McQueen's number four.<br> Monsieur.<br> At least you can get two tips.<br> - Pardon, monsieur.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Pardon.<br> - Excuse me, signor.<br> Well, my second husband,<br> Mr. Hubbard, would have raised hell.<br> No place for my makeup bag,<br> no ice in my drinking water,<br> and the hot water burps as it<br> comes out of the faucet.<br> Pardon.<br> Have courage, my friend.<br> It is the last compartment but one.<br> Pardon.<br> No.<br> I think there's a mistake.<br> Je crois que vous avez<br> fait une erreur.<br> Mr. McQueen, there is no<br> other berth on the train.<br> Monsieur Poirot has to come in here.<br> Voil? monsieur, all is arranged.<br> Yours is the upper berth,<br> the number four.<br> We start in one minute.<br> I apologize if I have<br> incommoded you here.<br> However, it is for one<br> night only at Belgrade Station.<br> Oh, I see. At Belgrade,<br> you're... You're getting off.<br> Better than the hotel?<br> I shall probably keep<br> the menu as a souvenir.<br> Hector, I ordered three Islamic<br> and six beakers.<br> They delivered only five beakers,<br> and one of the bowls arrived chipped,<br> which it was not when I paid for it.<br> Through the nose.<br> - Send a telegram from Belgrade.<br> - Yes. Yes, Mr. Ratchett.<br> What's the matter? You look tired.<br> - I slept badly.<br> - Yeah, why?<br> The Belgian in the upper berth snored.<br> Really? Any other<br> unanswered letters on file?<br> Only the anonymous ones.<br> We can't answer those, can we?<br> You'd better go catch up<br> on your sleep...<br> ...before the Belgian gentleman<br> gets back to your compartment.<br> Go on.<br> Hi. My name's Hardman.<br> Call me Dick.<br> - Foscarelli. Call me Gino.<br> - How are you?<br> Beddoes.<br> Mr. Beddoes.<br> For the pen of a Balzac.<br> For three days, all these people,<br> these total strangers,<br> meet in a single train whose<br> engine controls their destiny.<br> Yes, I know. We are both<br> envious of the husband.<br> Is?<br> Is the husband as British<br> as his tweeds?<br> Oh, heaven forbid.<br> He's a hot-blooded Hungarian.<br> If you but look at his wife,<br> he will cease to be a diplomat.<br> Thank God we are not young.<br> My second husband said<br> always to ask for change in dollars<br> or at worst, sterling.<br> So for Pete's sake,<br> what's a drachma?<br> It is... What do you call it?<br> The currency...<br> My second husband also said,<br> "Take a book of food tickets, Mama,<br> "and you'll have no problem,<br> no problem at all."<br> That just isn't so.<br> First there's this ten-percent tip. Five<br> would've done the steward more...<br> I think Miss Ohlsson has a headache.<br> Would you forgive us if we went back<br> to the compartment, Mrs. Hubbard?<br> Gladly, if you must.<br> If you need aspirin,<br> I always carry it on my person.<br> I mistrust foreign drugs.<br> You must excuse me,<br> Mrs. Hubbard is upon us.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Train-sick or something?<br> Some of us, in the words of the divine<br> Greta Garbo, "want to be alone".<br> And for dinner this evening?<br> You will have the goodness<br> to serve me the poached sole<br> with one new potato<br> and a small green salad<br> with no dressing. Hildegarde.<br> Who was that majestic lady?<br> - The Princess Dragomiroff.<br> - I have heard.<br> Pardon me, sir.<br> I wonder if you could<br> oblige me with a light.<br> Certainly.<br> Thank you.<br> My name is Ratchett.<br> Do I have the pleasure of speaking<br> to Mr. Hercule Poirot?<br> The pleasure possibly, Mr. Ratchett,<br> the intention certainly.<br> You asked me for a light.<br> I offered you one,<br> and you have not used it.<br> One can deduce that without<br> acute mental exhaustion.<br> That's wonderful. Sit down, sir.<br> - For a moment.<br> - Just for a moment.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Well, Mr. Poirot.<br> - Poirot.<br> - How's that?<br> - Poirot.<br> - Oh, Poirot. Right.<br> I just wanted to say that in my country<br> we also come quickly to the point.<br> I want you to take a job on for me.<br> It means big money.<br> Very big money.<br> What is the case, or, as you put it, the<br> job which you wish me to undertake?<br> Mr. Poirot, I'm a rich man.<br> Naturally, men in my<br> position have enemies.<br> Only one.<br> Now, what the hell<br> do you mean by that?<br> Merely that when a man is in a position<br> to have, as you say, enemies,<br> it does not usually resolve<br> itself into one enemy only.<br> Oh. Oh, sure. Sure. I appreciate that.<br> What is your profession?<br> I'm retired.<br> - From what?<br> - Business.<br> What sort of business?<br> Baby food.<br> But what does that matter?<br> What matters is my safety.<br> You are in danger?<br> My life has been threatened,<br> Mr. Poirot.<br> My secretary can show<br> you two letters on file.<br> And I... can show you this.<br> I sleep on it.<br> Mr. Poirot...<br> ...5,000 dollars.<br> No?<br> Ten thousand?<br> Fifteen thousand.<br> Mr. Ratchett, I have<br> made enough money<br> to satisfy both my needs<br> and my caprices.<br> I take only such cases now<br> as interest me,<br> and to be frank, my interest<br> in your case is... dwindling.<br> Belgrade Station.<br> The Orient Express will<br> depart in five minutes.<br> Monsieur Poirot.<br> I am transferring Signor Bianchi's<br> luggage to the Pullman.<br> He's giving you<br> his own compartment.<br> But you cannot sit up all night.<br> My dear friend,<br> do not concern yourself.<br> Since you are going to England,<br> it is better for you<br> to stay on the through coach<br> to Calais.<br> Now, Pierre has made me<br> very comfortable.<br> There is no one in the Pullman<br> but one Greek doctor. Ecco.<br> - Such generosity deserves my thanks.<br> - Buon riposa.<br> - Monsieur Poirot.<br> - Pierre,<br> - could I have some clean towels and...<br> - Yes, monsieur.<br> Who are my new neighbors?<br> To the left, monsieur,<br> the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson,<br> shares seven and eight with<br> the English lady, Miss Debenham.<br> And to the right, in number ten,<br> is Mr. Ratchett.<br> And where is the loquacious<br> Mrs. Hubbard?<br> I should like to get some<br> sleep tonight.<br> Beyond Mr. Ratchett,<br> in the number 11.<br> She is still too near.<br> Good night, Mr. Beddoes.<br> Pardon.<br> Who is it?<br> It's me, sir, Beddoes,<br> with your sedative.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you, Pierre. Good night.<br> Good night, monsieur,<br> and pleasant dreams in number nine.<br> - How many drops?<br> - Of the valerian?<br> - Two, sir, as you said.<br> - OK.<br> No, no. Put it on the table.<br> And tell Mr. McQueen I want<br> to see the text of the telegram<br> he sent from Belgrade.<br> Very well, sir.<br> He wants you.<br> Come in.<br> La belle Comtesse.<br> Ce n'est rien.<br> C'?ait un cauchemar.<br> Bien, Mr. Ratchett.<br> May you now have pleasant dreams.<br> C'est le silence de mort.<br> Snowdrift. Mon Dieu. Quelle nuit.<br> So now there's a man in my room.<br> I woke up in the dark<br> three minutes ago,<br> and there was a man hiding<br> in this compartment. I sensed it.<br> What's more, I know who he was<br> because I absent-mindedly<br> nearly walked through<br> his open door earlier this evening.<br> "Madame," said this Mr. Ratchett,<br> "If you'd done this 20 years ago,<br> I'd have said come in."<br> Twenty years ago?<br> Why, I'd only have been 15.<br> If there should be a reoccurrence,<br> do not hesitate to ring, Madame.<br> Enfin c'est le comble.<br> Evidemment, j'ai une crise de nerfs.<br> It's me, sir, Beddoes,<br> with your pick-me-up.<br> Your amber moon, Mr. Ratchett.<br> Your passkey.<br> The chain.<br> Pierre, touch nothing.<br> Where are Signor Bianchi<br> and the Greek doctor?<br> In the dining car, monsieur.<br> Fetch them at once.<br> Well, can't you tap<br> the telephone wires?<br> - Or fire a rocket, or something?<br> - This is not a ship, Madame.<br> - Where exactly are we?<br> - We are between Vinkovci and Brod.<br> - But in what country?<br> - In Yugoslavia.<br> The Balkans.<br> What else can you expect?<br> Snow is God's will.<br> And all is for the best.<br> Yeah, but how long do you think before<br> we can start getting out of here?<br> As soon as the stationmaster<br> at Brod sees<br> that we do not arrive on time,<br> he will send...<br> Dr. Constantine,<br> Monsieur Poirot wants to see you.<br> And you too, Signor Bianchi.<br> Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Only God's forgiveness is important.<br> Ich mochte meine Prinzessin<br> benachrichtigen.<br> Signor Bianchi<br> and Dr. Constantine.<br> Mind the broken glass, gentlemen.<br> Pupils still slightly dilated.<br> Could've been drugged.<br> - Was drugged.<br> - With what?<br> There's a smell of valerian,<br> which is harmless,<br> but something must've been added.<br> - May I close his eyes now?<br> - I wish you would.<br> Why did he lose so much blood?<br> - Can I pull back the bedclothes?<br> - By all means.<br> Mr. Ratchett has been<br> frontally stabbed<br> ten, 11, 12 times.<br> - Oh, Dio.<br> - Mon pauvre.<br> If you must go whoop-whoop,<br> please go whoop-whoop<br> not to windward, but to leeward.<br> Help him, Pierre.<br> There is something in the pocket.<br> Permit me.<br> - His watch.<br> - The time of death.<br> I can definitely say<br> that death occurred<br> between midnight<br> and 2 in the morning.<br> That would fit.<br> I myself heard him cry out and ring for<br> the conductor at 20 minutes to 1.<br> When Pierre arrived, he apologized<br> and said he had been<br> having a cauchemar.<br> A nightmare.<br> Then I heard him<br> use his washbasin.<br> And that is the last thing known.<br> I beg of you, monsieur.<br> You cannot refuse.<br> But it is the duty<br> of the Yugoslavian police.<br> Oh, what, monsieur, to question<br> my passengers on my line? Never.<br> Now you must solve the mystery.<br> When we get to Brod, if we ever do,<br> we present the police with<br> a fait accompli.<br> We say that a murder has occurred.<br> There is the criminal.<br> I should like<br> the Pullman coach reserved<br> for the investigation's headquarters.<br> It will be at your disposal.<br> And a plan of the Calais coach<br> with the names and locations<br> - of all the people in it.<br> - Yes, it will be there.<br> And the passports of all<br> the passengers concerned.<br> Yes, you can even have mine.<br> I go to make a special<br> announcement now. Grazie.<br> Bring all the passports<br> to Monsieur Poirot.<br> Are there any other<br> passengers on the train?<br> In the Pullman coach,<br> nobody but myself and Mr. Bianchi.<br> Alors.<br> Then we must concentrate<br> on the Calais coach.<br> Where, in my amateur opinion,<br> the murderer is with us now.<br> Ladies and gentlemen.<br> Please, please, patience.<br> You must have patience.<br> Now, you will all get the chance<br> to state your views to Monsieur Poirot<br> at his own good time.<br> - Now, please...<br> - It is not good time. It is bad time.<br> God's laws have been bust,<br> thou shalt not kill.<br> And why was I not notified at once,<br> Signor... Mr. Bianchi?<br> - I was his nearest associate.<br> - And I was nearest to his murderer.<br> You mean you saw the man?<br> You can identify the murderer?<br> I mean nothing of the kind.<br> I mean there was a man<br> in my compartment last night.<br> It was pitch-dark, of course,<br> and my eyes were closed in terror.<br> Then how did you know it was a man?<br> Because I've enjoyed very warm<br> relationships with both my husbands.<br> - With your eyes closed?<br> - That helped.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Anyway, the man smelt of tobacco.<br> Mr. McQueen,<br> Monsieur Poirot would be grateful<br> for a few minutes of your time.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Don't you agree the man<br> must've entered my compartment<br> to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?<br> I can think of no other reason,<br> Madame.<br> Pierre, your passkey.<br> Voil? monsieur.<br> And will you discreetly procure<br> me a lady's hatbox,<br> one of the big, old-fashioned kind,<br> perhaps from the<br> Princess Dragomiroff's maid?<br> Give me five minutes, doctor.<br> Mr. McQueen, I regret<br> to have kept you waiting,<br> but there has been much to establish.<br> Please be seated. Now,<br> Mr. McQueen, I should be grateful<br> for anything you can usefully tell me.<br> What, for example, is?<br> Let's get just a couple<br> of things straight first, Mr. Poirot.<br> Who, for example, are you,<br> and what is your status here?<br> Excuse me.<br> Monsieur Poirot is a detective,<br> officially delegated to investigate<br> this case by me.<br> Let us proceed with the matter in<br> hand. Your relationship with Ratchett?<br> I'm his... I was his secretary.<br> - For how long?<br> - A year, give or take.<br> - Where did you meet?<br> - In Persia.<br> He was collecting Gorgan pottery<br> with considerable success.<br> And I was trying to collect oil<br> concessions, you know,<br> with so little success<br> that I went bankrupt,<br> and he offered me the job. I took it.<br> - And since then?<br> - Well, we've traveled around.<br> He was hampered<br> by not knowing any languages.<br> I acted more as his courier<br> than as his secretary.<br> It was a pleasant enough job.<br> What part of America<br> did Ratchett come from?<br> I don't know.<br> The fact is, he never talked<br> about his background.<br> - Why, do you think?<br> - Well, I used to...<br> Well, I began to believe<br> that he had left America<br> to escape something, you know.<br> Or someone. And until a couple<br> of weeks ago, I think he succeeded.<br> And then?<br> Well, he began to get these<br> anonymous letters,<br> threatening letters, like these.<br> "I kill killers."<br> "Prepare to die."<br> - How brief.<br> - But in a sense, how complicated.<br> Last night, I noticed you dispatching<br> a telegram from Belgrade Station.<br> That's right.<br> Let's see, he sent for me<br> to see the text<br> right after we left Belgrade.<br> And then he went...<br> Yeah, it was the last I ever saw of him.<br> Were there any other<br> threatening letters?<br> Yeah, but none that<br> I was allowed to read.<br> He used to... He used to burn them.<br> That explains...<br> What?<br> My interest in hatboxes.<br> Precisely what I needed.<br> Doctor, first the wounds.<br> - You counted a dozen?<br> - Yes.<br> Five are deep,<br> of which three are lethal.<br> The rest are shallow.<br> And two...<br> ...are so slight as to be<br> mere scratches.<br> What does that suggest?<br> That there were two murderers,<br> a strong man and a weak man?<br> Or a weak woman.<br> Or a strong man stabbing<br> the victim both strongly<br> and weakly in order to confuse us.<br> At least we know that<br> by the time of the murder,<br> Ratchett was too drugged to cry out<br> or defend himself with this.<br> But how did you guess?<br> I didn't. He showed it to me<br> when he offered me $15,000<br> to be his bodyguard and I refused.<br> Ought I to have accepted?<br> Now, let us consider the ashtray.<br> Two different matches.<br> A smoked cigar.<br> - A pipe cleaner...<br> - And this.<br> - The initial H.<br> - That should not be hard to identify.<br> I wonder, Christian name or surname?<br> We must wait until<br> we examine the passports.<br> Bianchi, doctor,<br> has it occurred to you that there<br> are too many clues in this room?<br> Let us proceed by examining what<br> I hope will prove to be the last of them.<br> The burnt paper.<br> I use it for the mustaches.<br> What has that to do<br> with mustaches?<br> To melt the wax.<br> Observe, memorize,<br> you are my only witnesses.<br> - A-l-S-Y A-R-M-S.<br> - What does that mean?<br> It means we know<br> the true identity of Mr. Ratchett.<br> And why he had to leave America.<br> Do you remember<br> the Armstrong case?<br> Of course, the kidnapping of that<br> little American girl, and the killing.<br> Who does not?<br> Do you remember the name<br> of the child?<br> Certamente. It was Daisy.<br> D.<br> D-A<br> l-S-Y.<br> Space, A-R-M-S.<br> Daisy Armstrong.<br> - And Ratchett was her murderer?<br> - Well, no, the actual murderer<br> was tried, sentenced<br> and electrocuted.<br> But he was only the number two.<br> The subordinate of a boss whom,<br> at first, he was too terrified to identify.<br> Only on the eve of his electrocution<br> did he give the name of the boss,<br> who by then had disappeared<br> with the ransom money.<br> I remember feeling ashamed<br> that he had an Italian name.<br> Cassetti.<br> Che mostro. He had<br> a child's blood on his hands.<br> He had worse than that.<br> After the shock<br> of the body's discovery,<br> Mrs. Armstrong gave premature birth<br> to a stillborn child,<br> and herself died in the process.<br> Her husband, Colonel Armstrong,<br> once a brave officer in<br> the Scots Guard, shot himself,<br> and Mrs. Armstrong's personal maid,<br> who came wrongly<br> under suspicion of complicity,<br> threw herself from her<br> bedroom window and she died,<br> so five deaths, five.<br> Then I thank heaven that Giuseppe,<br> who spilt so much blood in his lifetime,<br> should have his own blood<br> spilt now.<br> Excellent, Pierre. And could you<br> summon the passengers to me here?<br> One by one in this order except<br> for the Princess Dragomiroff,<br> who is not only of royal blood, but also<br> much older than she tries not to look.<br> And, Pierre, since you are here<br> already, we can conveniently start<br> by questioning you.<br> Your full name is Pierre Paul Michel.<br> - Correct, monsieur.<br> - Two male saints' names.<br> You must be greatly blessed.<br> I've had my share<br> of good fortune, monsieur.<br> So... And of bad.<br> I note the cancellation<br> of your wife's photograph<br> nearly five years ago.<br> - She is deceased.<br> - She died, monsieur.<br> Of grief at the death<br> of our only daughter.<br> From scarlet fever.<br> I am truly sorry.<br> Let us talk of less<br> distressing matters.<br> On the night of the murder,<br> after we left Belgrade,<br> who were the last passengers<br> to retire to their compartment?<br> Show me on the diagram.<br> About 1:30, I remember seeing<br> the English colonel say good night<br> to Mr. McQueen outside<br> number three and four.<br> I saw him walk back into his<br> compartment, number 15,<br> which he did not leave.<br> And after that,<br> did no one reemerge?<br> No, but there was one lady<br> who opened a door,<br> I don't know which, and walked<br> in the direction of the toilet<br> at the far end of the corridor,<br> next to the dining car.<br> - Did you see her return?<br> - No, monsieur.<br> It is possible<br> I was answering a bell.<br> That reminds me of a final point.<br> Much earlier, soon after 12:30,<br> you and I both heard Mr. Ratchett<br> ring his bell several times and then<br> apologize for having had a nightmare.<br> Ce n'est rien.<br> C'?ait un cauchemar.<br> Who rang the second bell while<br> you were answering Mr. Ratchett's?<br> The Princess Dragomiroff, monsieur.<br> She asked me to summon her maid.<br> Thank you, Pierre.<br> That is all for the moment.<br> He had the means to do it.<br> The passkey to Ratchett's room.<br> - And a knife borrowed from the chef.<br> - With whom he was in league.<br> Which he plunged repeatedly<br> and without motive into the body<br> of his suitably astonished victim.<br> Anyway, we know the door<br> was not only locked, but chained.<br> Mr. McQueen.<br> Since our last conversation,<br> I have learned the true identity<br> of your late employer.<br> You don't say.<br> Ratchett was, as you yourself<br> suspected, merely an alias.<br> He was, in fact, Cassetti.<br> The gangster who masterminded<br> the kidnapping and killing<br> of little Daisy Armstrong.<br> You had no idea of this?<br> Oh, no, sir.<br> If I had, I'd have cut off my right hand<br> so I couldn't type his lousy letters.<br> And I'd have killed him with my left.<br> You feel you could've done<br> the good deed yourself?<br> It seems like I'm kind of<br> incriminating myself.<br> I should be more inclined<br> to suspect you, Mr. McQueen,<br> if you displayed an inordinate sorrow<br> at your employer's decease.<br> Sorrow?<br> My dad, my father,<br> was the district attorney, yeah,<br> who handled the Armstrong case.<br> Mrs. Armstrong and her husband<br> came to our house twice<br> for advice about the ransom money.<br> She was gentle and frightened.<br> But not too frightened to take<br> an interest in a young man<br> who wanted to go on the stage.<br> She even said she'd write to...<br> She died before<br> she got around to that.<br> She was as helpful<br> to me as a...<br> Well, a mother.<br> Forgive a Freudian question.<br> - Do you love your mother?<br> - I did.<br> She died when I was 8.<br> An impressionable age.<br> - Why do you ask?<br> - We shared a compartment<br> on the first night of our journey.<br> You cried out to your mother<br> twice in your sleep.<br> Did I?<br> I still dream about her.<br> Go on. Tell me.<br> I'm emotionally retarded.<br> Tell me that's why<br> I never married.<br> I am not here to tell you anything,<br> Mr. McQueen. You are here to tell me.<br> Yeah, I'm sorry.<br> Yeah, there's just one thing.<br> How did you...<br> ...figure out Ratchett's identity?<br> By a message found<br> in his compartment.<br> He'd have burnt that, though,<br> as I told you.<br> He did.<br> Yeah, he did.<br> - Then how did you decipher?<br> - With the help of a hatbox.<br> Thank you, Mr. McQueen.<br> He did it.<br> He murdered Cassetti.<br> He practically confessed as much.<br> No, the psychology is wrong.<br> A sensitive, motherless boy<br> conceives a passion for a lady<br> whom he admires above all<br> for her gentleness.<br> Now, could McQueen,<br> admiring the gentleness,<br> commit so foul a murder<br> without betraying the gentleness<br> of what we might call<br> his fairy godmother?<br> Godmother.<br> Now you have accidentally<br> said something valuable.<br> Come.<br> Mr. Beddoes, this is not<br> an inquisition, only an inquiry.<br> When you took Mr. Ratchett<br> his valerian drops<br> about 9:40 yesterday evening,<br> was he already in bed?<br> That is so, sir. Mr. Ratchett<br> always retired early on trains.<br> What were your duties before<br> leaving him for the night?<br> To place the valerian drops<br> within reach, sir.<br> - Beddoes.<br> - Sir?<br> Did you put this on my table<br> during dinner?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Then who the hell did?<br> I have no idea, sir.<br> May I ask what it is?<br> What it is, is none<br> of your damn business.<br> I wanna know how it got here.<br> - Will there be anything more, sir?<br> - There will.<br> Tell Mr. McQueen<br> I wanna see him, now.<br> Very well, sir.<br> At what time would you like<br> to be called in the morning, sir?<br> Not before 10.<br> Very good, sir.<br> - Was that usual?<br> - Oh, quite, sir, yes.<br> His breakfast was his amber moon.<br> He never rose<br> until it had had its full effect.<br> So you instructed Mr. McQueen<br> and then returned<br> to your own compartment,<br> the number one and two,<br> whose upper berth was occupied<br> by Signor Foscarelli.<br> Oh, yes, sir, the Italian person.<br> - Does he speak English?<br> - A kind of English, sir.<br> I think he learned it<br> in a place called Chicago.<br> Did you talk together much?<br> Oh, no, sir. I prefer to read.<br> Hey, what are you reading,<br> Mr. Beddoes?<br> Love's Captive,<br> by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.<br> Is it about sex?<br> No, it's about 10:30, Mr. Foscarelli.<br> I like that.<br> "It's about 10:30."<br> - And after that you went to sleep.<br> - Oh, no, sir.<br> Not until 4 in the morning.<br> Unfortunately, I had the toothache.<br> - And your companion?<br> - He snored incessantly.<br> - And your companion?<br> - He snored incessantly.<br> One final point. How did you come<br> to be employed by Mr. Ratchett?<br> Through Maibaums, sir,<br> the big agency in New York.<br> You'll find me on their books.<br> And before then?<br> I was in the army, sir,<br> as a private soldier.<br> - Where?<br> - Troon, sir.<br> - In the Far East?<br> - Oh, no, sir, in Scotland.<br> Oh, Scotland.<br> Oh, forgive me.<br> I am only an ignorant Belgian.<br> Oh, a Belgian, sir?<br> I always thought you were French.<br> Belgian.<br> Did you know that Mr. Ratchett<br> was of Italian extraction?<br> So that accounts for his hot temper.<br> His real name was Cassetti.<br> The name means nothing to you?<br> Do you remember<br> the Armstrong case?<br> No, sir. Oh, yes, yes.<br> The little girl.<br> Cassetti was responsible<br> for her murder.<br> - How does that strike you?<br> - I have often thought, sir,<br> that instead of our employers<br> requiring references from us,<br> we should require<br> references from them.<br> Thank you, Mr. Beddoes.<br> Oh, please don't get up, sir.<br> Will there be anything else?<br> No, that is all.<br> He did it. The butler did it.<br> He had constant access<br> to Ratchett.<br> He himself could have<br> poisoned the valerian<br> before bringing it to his master.<br> As for the psychological,<br> well, who knows what boils<br> and bubbles beneath that stiff shirt<br> to which his profession<br> has called him.<br> Did he not read Love's Captive?<br> At a time when you suggest he should<br> have been stabbing Mr. Ratchett?<br> I fear that help is at hand.<br> Even if it is only a working party<br> with picks and shovels,<br> we must make haste to complete<br> this inquiry before we reach Brod.<br> If it is an engine with a snowplow,<br> our troubles will really begin.<br> - Who's next?<br> - Mrs. Hubbard.<br> Oh, my God.<br> The whistle means<br> that help is near, Madame.<br> - And high time too.<br> - Time is what counts, Mrs. Hubbard,<br> if we are to complete this inquiry<br> before reaching Brod.<br> I will therefore make my questions<br> as brief as I hope you will make<br> your answers,<br> and the more often<br> you can confine yourself<br> to a simple yes or no, the better.<br> Well, don't waste time<br> yammering, begin.<br> Your full name<br> is Harriet Belinda Hubbard?<br> Yes. I was called Harriet after my...<br> By now, Mr. McQueen<br> has doubtless informed you<br> - of the true identity of Mr. Ratchett?<br> - Yes, that low-down, stinking...<br> Were you acquainted<br> with the Armstrongs?<br> No, of course not. They were<br> a very social family. Anyway...<br> Mrs. Hubbard, I overhead the whole<br> of your conversation with Pierre<br> about there being a man<br> in your room soon after 1:00<br> on the night of the murder.<br> Tell me one thing more.<br> Wasn't the door locked<br> on your side of the door<br> that communicated with Mr. Ratchett's<br> compartment when you went to bed?<br> Yes, so far as I know.<br> My second husband...<br> What do you mean,<br> as far as you know?<br> Could you not see<br> the bolt from the bed?<br> - No.<br> - Why?<br> It was masked by my makeup bag<br> on the hook above.<br> Pierre checked the bolt<br> after I rang my bell<br> and told him there had been a man<br> hiding in my compartment.<br> Yes, yes, we know all about that.<br> Oh, no, you don't.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> You don't know what I found this<br> morning on top of the magazine<br> I'd been reading to send myself asleep.<br> What?<br> Dio mio.<br> This is a button from the tunic<br> of a wagon-lit conductor.<br> Doctor, would you kindly inquire<br> whether Pierre has lost a tunic button?<br> Gladly.<br> Your handkerchief, Mrs. Hubbard.<br> Oh, that's not mine.<br> I have mine right here.<br> Oh, I thought the initial H...<br> H for Harriet, H for Hubbard,<br> but it's still not mine.<br> Mine are sensible things,<br> not expensive Paris frills.<br> What good's a hankie like that<br> to anybody?<br> One sneeze and it has to go<br> to the laundry.<br> Oh, Mrs. Hubbard,<br> you have afforded me a great deal<br> of help in this difficult case.<br> Thank you, if I may so express it,<br> for playing your part.<br> If you need me again, I'll be around.<br> Not one of Pierre's buttons<br> is missing,<br> and all his buttons are sewn on<br> with old thread.<br> As I suspected.<br> - I'm fright.<br> - Have no fear, mademoiselle.<br> They all come out looking<br> much more peaceful.<br> Only God can give peaceful.<br> - God dag, fr?en Ohlsson.<br> - Nej, talar ni svenska.<br> Alas, mademoiselle,<br> that is the extent of my Swedish.<br> Forgive me if I am personal,<br> but most Scandinavians<br> of my acquaintance<br> are well-educated<br> in other languages.<br> And yet you have difficulty...<br> I... I was born backwards.<br> That is why I work in Africa<br> as missionary,<br> teaching little brown babies<br> more backward than myself.<br> But I... I see that you have spent<br> three months in America.<br> Were you not able to improve?<br> I was in... In a mis...<br> I... I... International group.<br> In... For getting money for<br> African mission from American rich.<br> I... I speak Swedish<br> to big audiences<br> in... In...<br> In Swedish-American institution<br> in Minneapolis and other big cities.<br> In ten weeks,<br> we make $14,000 and...<br> And 27 cents.<br> That's wonderful, wonderful.<br> Miss Ohlsson, how long have you<br> been interested in religion?<br> From five years.<br> In summer, in...<br> I had been sick as always.<br> And I sat in the grass in the garden.<br> And I... I saw Jesus in the sky,<br> mit many little children,<br> but all the children were brown.<br> So it was a sign for me<br> - to look after little brown babies.<br> - Yes.<br> Were your parents religious?<br> Ne, they had no respect for God.<br> No.<br> So it was not just a sign,<br> it was also a punishment.<br> Oh, there, there, there, there.<br> I'm sure that God will forgive you,<br> Miss Ohlsson,<br> and perhaps, which is more important,<br> so will your father and mother.<br> Now...<br> ...here is the compartment<br> you share with...<br> Ja, and here is<br> my number seven bed.<br> Yes, your number seven.<br> Tell me about number eight.<br> Is filled with Miss Debenham,<br> a very nice young lady from Baghdad,<br> where she teach English shorthand<br> to children,<br> to forward children.<br> After the train left Vinkovci,<br> did she leave her berth?<br> Ne, she sleep just like me.<br> If you were fast asleep, how could<br> you be so sure she did not leave?<br> In Shimoga Mission,<br> I can hear snake breathe.<br> I would know.<br> Good. And did you leave your room?<br> Ne, not till morning, in my bed gown.<br> Is your bed gown white<br> with red animals?<br> Ne, is Jaeger.<br> And Miss Debenham's bed gown?<br> Den var em lila.<br> - Oh, like the French "lilas", "lilac".<br> - Ja.<br> - Just det lila, just det lila.<br> - Lila, lila.<br> Good. And why are you making<br> this trip, Miss Ohlsson?<br> Just as always, money,<br> money for mission.<br> Good. Good.<br> When this is all over, mademoiselle,<br> I promise that I shall make you<br> an emolument.<br> God will find you a reward.<br> Tack s?mycket. Tack. Tack.<br> Monsieur, she did it.<br> Merci, Pierre, and could you please<br> inform the Princess Dragomiroff<br> that Signor Bianchi and I will attend<br> on her and her maid<br> - shortly in her compartment?<br> - Oui, monsieur.<br> That is very proper.<br> Monsieur le Comte, this is<br> a Hungarian diplomatic passport.<br> It gives you and your wife<br> the right to refuse interrogation.<br> In the circumstances,<br> we waive that right.<br> You are most kind.<br> As you know,<br> Madame la Comtesse,<br> it is a joint passport which sets out<br> your husband's name and titles,<br> but requires no particulars<br> about yourself,<br> except your signature<br> and your maiden name.<br> Your maiden name<br> is clearly Grunwald.<br> That is correct, monsieur.<br> My family is of German extraction,<br> though I now hold<br> Hungarian citizenship.<br> Unfortunately, the first letter<br> of your married signature<br> has been almost obliterated<br> by a grease spot.<br> I must say, I find immigration officials<br> are often less than cleanly. They...<br> They sit in their little box,<br> eating a buttered roll with one hand<br> and stamping the spilt butter<br> into your passport with the other.<br> Precisely. Therefore,<br> I would be greatly obliged<br> if you could duplicate<br> the mutilated entry of your passport<br> there.<br> Elena Andrenyi n? Grunwald.<br> Allowing for the difference in pens,<br> the duplication seems exact.<br> There would be little point, then,<br> in asking<br> whether this handkerchief is yours?<br> Since it contains neither of my initials,<br> no point whatsoever, monsieur.<br> And even less point in asking<br> the color of your dressing gown?<br> None, unless monsieur takes<br> a professional interest in apricot silk?<br> I take a professional interest<br> in crime, Madame.<br> Have you and your husband<br> ever visited America together?<br> No. We first met in Wiesbaden...<br> ...much later.<br> - Later than what?<br> Later than the days of my youth,<br> when I was on post in Washington.<br> You lived in Washington?<br> Oh, what diplomat of promise has not?<br> You did not sleep well last night?<br> On the contrary, apart from one of<br> Mrs. Hubbard's customary outbursts,<br> I slept very soundly.<br> - And you, Madame?<br> - Oh, even more soundly.<br> We, neither of us, woke till after 8.<br> As is my custom on night trains,<br> I took Trional.<br> Diethyl-sulphone-dimethyl-methane.<br> One dilutes the white crystals<br> with water, it is a strong hypnotic.<br> He makes it sound like a poison.<br> As with most sleeping drafts,<br> if taken in sufficient quantities,<br> it is a poison.<br> - You are not accusing...<br> - You are not accused,<br> you are excused.<br> Thank you both for your help<br> and cooperation.<br> "Kennst du das Land,<br> wo die Zitronen bl?en?"<br> "Im dunklen Laub<br> die Gold-Orangen gl?en,"<br> "Ein sanfter Wind<br> vom Blauen Himmel weht,"<br> "Die Myrte still<br> und hoch der Lorbeer steht"<br> "Kennst du es wohl?"<br> Why have you stopped reading?<br> "Dahin! Dahin!<br> M?ht ich mit dir, o mein Gelieb... "<br> - Altezza.<br> - Signor Bianchi.<br> ?permesso presentare<br> L'investigatore distinto,<br> Monsieur Hercule Poirot?<br> Hildegarde has read me many<br> of your cases in the newspapers,<br> but I have had to stop her.<br> Nowadays, they are the only form<br> of literature that keeps me awake.<br> And I need what I defiantly continue<br> to call my beauty sleep.<br> - You would care for a little cognac?<br> - Thank you, no.<br> Yes, please.<br> Now, you wish me to confess<br> to the murder of Mr.?<br> What's his name?<br> Au contraire, Madame la Princesse,<br> it is I who wish to make a confession.<br> You pay me the compliment<br> of having read about me,<br> I return the compliment<br> by admitting that<br> I have read about you.<br> Continue.<br> I have been accidentally reminded<br> that you were the godmother<br> of Mrs. Armstrong,<br> who was herself the mother<br> of the kidnapped child, Daisy.<br> How did you become Mrs. Armstrong's<br> godmother, Madame?<br> I was the friend and admirer<br> of her mother,<br> the great American actress,<br> Linda Arden.<br> Why did you bring these daggers<br> from the place?<br> Is that a quotation or a question?<br> A quotation. I saw her twice<br> as Lady Macbeth in London.<br> She was the greatest<br> tragic actress of her day.<br> Was? Surely she is still alive,<br> Madame?<br> Alive, but bedridden.<br> Did she not have a second daughter,<br> younger than Mrs. Armstrong?<br> There was,<br> but I do not recall her name.<br> When I paid a visit,<br> she was always away at school.<br> What became of<br> the younger daughter?<br> She married a Turk or some such.<br> We never spoke of it.<br> What was Mrs. Armstrong's<br> maiden name?<br> Mrs. Armstrong's<br> maiden name was<br> Greenwood.<br> May I tax your memory and,<br> indeed, your patience a little longer?<br> There are other names<br> in the Armstrong household<br> that I cannot recall.<br> Was there not a secretary?<br> Of course there was a secretary.<br> Her name, Madame?<br> Her name.<br> Oh, my memor...<br> She was a Miss Freebody.<br> Was there not a gallant chauffeur?<br> There was.<br> I never used him. I had my own.<br> Surely he was not<br> the only male servant?<br> I seem to remember one other there.<br> He was, I think you would say,<br> the colonel's Indian orderly.<br> And Mrs. Armstrong's<br> personal maid.<br> The one who was wrongly suspected<br> of complicity in the kidnapping<br> - and killed herself?<br> - I always travel<br> with my own personal maid.<br> There was no need to speak<br> with Mrs. Armstrong's.<br> Doubtless, Fr?lein Schmidt<br> will remember her name.<br> Surely, Fr?lein,<br> as one lady's maid to another,<br> you conversed<br> as equals below stairs.<br> Ja, ja, nat?lich.<br> But ladies' maids were often called<br> only by their Christian names.<br> And what was hers?<br> Paulette.<br> Hildegarde.<br> You will be so kind<br> as to give me two aspirin.<br> And you will ask<br> the dining-car attendant<br> to bring me a glass of Russian tea,<br> and then you may retire<br> to your own compartment.<br> I will ring when I need you.<br> Ja wohl, meine Prinzessin.<br> Finally, there was the nurse.<br> I had no need<br> of a nurse.<br> That is an ordeal still to come.<br> You never smile,<br> Madame la Princesse.<br> My doctor has advised<br> against it.<br> Excuse me.<br> There is no need for us<br> to fatigue you further.<br> You have been of the utmost help.<br> Go back to the Pullman<br> and tell Pierre<br> to summon Colonel Arbuthnott<br> in five minutes.<br> - I want a word with the maid.<br> - Yes, Poirot.<br> Fr?lein Schmidt, I wonder<br> if I might have a word with you<br> about a small matter<br> in the privacy of your compartment?<br> - I have to take these aspirins...<br> - We will leave the door ajar.<br> I observed how moved you were<br> at the mention<br> of Mrs. Armstrong's maid, Paulette.<br> She had a sweet nature, mein Herr.<br> We were deep friends.<br> Have you a photograph of her<br> in your possession?<br> Ja. I never travel without my photo box.<br> It helps to pass the evenings.<br> No, please, mein Herr.<br> I am strong.<br> Be calm.<br> This could be your salvation<br> and that of every passenger<br> in the Calais coach,<br> including your mistress.<br> When did you last open the suitcase?<br> After Belgrade. When Pierre<br> summoned me to the Prinzessin,<br> I took out a volume of Goethe, in case<br> she wished me to read her to sleep.<br> Too stout for Pierre.<br> And, yes, there is a button missing<br> from the tunic.<br> A button found by Mrs. Hubbard.<br> And a passkey in the trouser pocket.<br> Here is the photo, mein Herr.<br> And this pretty, innocent girl<br> threw herself from a window.<br> Use this, Fr?lein.<br> I found it in the corridor<br> and thought it must be yours<br> - because it bears the initial H.<br> - No. No.<br> That is the handkerchief<br> not of a maid, but of a great lady.<br> Like your mistress?<br> It is her style, ja,<br> but not her handkerchief.<br> I know all her linen.<br> Besides,<br> the initial is wrong.<br> What is the princess's first name?<br> Natalia, mein Herr.<br> It is a Russian name.<br> Then I must keep it<br> until I find the rightful owner.<br> Might I also keep the photograph until<br> this evening? I promise to return it.<br> Ja. Ja. That does not worry me,<br> but this,<br> this does.<br> Am I to be accused<br> of hiding it in my suitcase?<br> Fr?lein, I am as sure<br> you did not hide the uniform<br> as I am sure you are a good<br> and loyal friend to your mistress.<br> Not only a good maid,<br> but also a good cook.<br> Not merely a good cook,<br> but a companion, a comfort, a solace.<br> You see? You are a good cook,<br> are you not?<br> All my ladies have said so. I...<br> Auf Wiedersehen.<br> Animal crackers in my soup<br> Lions and tigers loop-the-loop<br> You opening a dress shop?<br> No.<br> We are closing an inquiry.<br> Where is Shimoga?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Shimoga, where is it?<br> Well, it's a bit off my track.<br> I'm a Northwest Frontier man myself.<br> But Shimoga's down south,<br> in Mysore. Why?<br> Does it possess a mission?<br> How the hell should I know?<br> India's pustular with missions.<br> You are returning on leave<br> from India to England?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why overland?<br> Why not?<br> Because the sea route<br> by P and O is more usual.<br> I chose to come overland<br> for reasons of my own.<br> Colonel Arbuthnott,<br> in a murder inquiry,<br> no suspect's reasons<br> are exclusively his own.<br> I stopped for one night<br> to see Ur of the Chaldees,<br> and for three days in Baghdad<br> with the A.O.C.,<br> who happens to be<br> a friend of mine.<br> The English Miss Debenham<br> also has traveled from Baghdad.<br> It is possible the murder<br> was committed by a woman<br> or by a man and a woman<br> in collaboration.<br> From your acquaintanceship<br> with Miss Debenham,<br> would you have thought<br> that she was<br> capable physically or emotionally or?<br> - That's a bloody irregular question.<br> - I know, but I ask it.<br> Miss Debenham is not a woman.<br> - She's a lady.<br> - Which precludes her<br> from being a murderess?<br> Damn it,<br> the man was a perfect stranger.<br> - She'd never seen him before.<br> - You feel warmly in the matter.<br> I don't know what you're driving at.<br> Then let us be practical<br> and drive at facts.<br> Did you know Colonel Armstrong?<br> Not to speak to.<br> You see, his outfit and mine<br> wouldn't have mixed much.<br> I'm Indian army.<br> He was British army, serving in India.<br> Royal Scots.<br> - How did you know?<br> - It was in the papers<br> when he shot himself<br> after the kidnapping.<br> Rotten show.<br> Thought he'd been tougher than that.<br> After all, he got a D.S.O.<br> And an M.C. In France.<br> Distinguished Service Order.<br> Military Cross.<br> Mon colonel,<br> Ratchett was responsible<br> for five deaths:<br> The suicide<br> of the falsely accused maid.<br> The murder of the Armstrong child.<br> The death of Mrs. Armstrong,<br> while giving premature birth<br> to a stillborn baby.<br> And the ultimate suicide<br> of Colonel Armstrong,<br> in the face of multiple<br> and intolerable bereavements!<br> I would have understood his action<br> if, in addition to the D.S.O. And M.C.,<br> he had been awarded the V.C.<br> Which stands, as you may know,<br> for Victoria Cross<br> and is awarded for valor.<br> Then, in my opinion,<br> Ratchett deserved what he got.<br> Though I'd sooner have seen him<br> properly tried by jury.<br> Trial by 12 good men and true<br> is a sound system.<br> We believe the murder<br> was committed at 1:15.<br> What were you doing then?<br> I was yarning with young...<br> What's his name?<br> McQueen, in his compartment.<br> He was interested in the future<br> of India, a bit impractical.<br> He thought the British<br> ought to move out.<br> How long did you stay yarning<br> after that?<br> Till 1:30. It's...<br> It's what I call a three-pipe yarn.<br> Colonel Arbuthnott, you are the only<br> passenger in the Calais coach<br> who smokes a "pipe".<br> - So it would appear.<br> - Then this...<br> ...must be your "pipe" cleaner.<br> - It's the same brand.<br> - It was found in an ashtray<br> by the dead man's bedside.<br> Then someone planted it there.<br> It's a used "pipe" cleaner.<br> Or are you suggesting<br> that I'm fool enough<br> to have entered Ratchett's cabin,<br> murdered him,<br> cleaned my "pipe" and dropped it<br> in the ashtray before leaving?<br> No, Colonel Arbuthnott.<br> Miss Debenham.<br> - Can I stay?<br> - No, Colonel Arbuthnott.<br> Please be seated.<br> Forgive me, Miss Debenham,<br> I must be brief.<br> You met Colonel Arbuthnott and fell<br> in love with each other in Baghdad.<br> Why must the English conceal<br> even their most impeccable emotions?<br> To answer your observations<br> in order,<br> of course, yes, yes,<br> and I don't know.<br> Then let me tell you what you do know,<br> that on the Bosporus Ferryboat<br> I overheard a part of your conversation<br> with the colonel.<br> Not now, not now. When it's all over.<br> When it's behind us, then.<br> When what was all over,<br> Miss Debenham?<br> And when what was behind you?<br> Was it some task<br> that had to be performed?<br> Some ordeal that<br> had to be endured?<br> Some dark deed<br> that had to be dispatched?<br> Mr. Poirot, I'm not at liberty<br> to answer any of those questions.<br> Not here on this train, perhaps.<br> But when the Yugoslav police take<br> over an unsolved murder case at Brod,<br> you will not remain at liberty<br> unless you answer the questions.<br> I can always call my lawyers<br> long-distance.<br> This is a private matter<br> between the colonel and myself.<br> Miss Debenham, in a murder case,<br> no matter is private<br> and evasion breeds suspicion,<br> so answer my question.<br> When what was all over?<br> When what was behind you?<br> Please answer the question.<br> You will remain here<br> until I get an answer from you.<br> Mon colonel, please, Monsieur Poirot<br> has expressly forbidden...<br> Poirot has no right, he's out of order.<br> This is a private matter.<br> Je vous en prie, mon colonel.<br> - Mon colonel.<br> - Out of my way.<br> So answer my question.<br> When what was all over?<br> When what was behind?<br> Answer my question.<br> Get your hands off<br> Miss Debenham.<br> I was not aware that I was keeping<br> my hands on Miss Debenham.<br> I asked her a simple question<br> - which she refused to answer.<br> - So I heard.<br> Then perhaps you can<br> answer it for her.<br> Can you give me your solemn oath,<br> as a foreigner,<br> that if the answer<br> has nothing to do with the murder,<br> you'll treat it confidentially?<br> I will.<br> Six months ago,<br> before I'd even met Miss Debenham,<br> - my memsahib...<br> - Come again?<br> My wife<br> expressed herself bored,<br> not only at living in India,<br> but at living with me.<br> And asked me to provide her<br> with a divorce.<br> In view of my position, commanding<br> officer, 12th Gurkhas, I refused.<br> Well, had I not,<br> I should have lost my command.<br> My wife returned to England,<br> where there is irrefutable evidence<br> that she has been persistently<br> unfaithful to me.<br> I have therefore instituted<br> divorce proceedings<br> in which she is cited<br> as the guilty party.<br> And when those proceedings<br> are behind us,<br> when those proceedings<br> are all over...<br> ...I propose<br> to marry Miss Debenham.<br> Meanwhile,<br> it is of vital importance,<br> under English law, that our...<br> ...behavior...<br> ...should not provide evidence<br> for counter-proceedings<br> by my wife.<br> Does that answer your question?<br> Well...<br> ...it is certainly an answer.<br> Doctor, is Pierre<br> sufficiently recovered?<br> - Fully.<br> - May we go?<br> You may, with my assurance that<br> our foreigners' lips shall be sealed.<br> Sorry if I hurt the lad.<br> Provocation.<br> They could have done it together. She<br> has hidden fires. She is very strong.<br> Why did you not ask her<br> if she had been to America?<br> Because I did not need to.<br> Pierre, le colonel<br> s'excuse de son geste.<br> Merci, monsieur.<br> Signor Foscarelli.<br> You are a naturalized<br> American subject?<br> - You bet.<br> - For how long?<br> Seven years. Mi ricordo del<br> giorno preciso quando...<br> Faccia di rispondere<br> alle domande.<br> Otherwise, he will detain you<br> longer than you would detain him.<br> You are a motorcar salesman.<br> You bet.<br> American automobiles to Italians.<br> Did you know Cassetti?<br> Not on your sweet life.<br> Era Mafioso.<br> He says he was Mafia.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes.<br> Who do you?<br> Who do you think killed him?<br> - Un altro Mafioso.<br> - He says another Mafia.<br> They are always killing each<br> other with a knife or with a gun...<br> Why did you bring<br> this dagger from the place?<br> Because I found it<br> in my makeup bag.<br> Ecco, what did I say?<br> Knives or guns. It's a vendetta<br> between two Mafiosi.<br> Give me the dagger.<br> When did you last open<br> your makeup bag?<br> Yesterday evening,<br> when I took everything out.<br> If you took everything out,<br> why did you need to reopen it?<br> Because I was putting<br> something back in.<br> You may set your mind at rest,<br> Mrs. Hubbard.<br> - The missing button.<br> - Precisely,<br> and I can assure you the owner<br> of the tunic is not now on the train.<br> Are you going back<br> to the dining car?<br> I'll say I am. Do you think<br> I could face my compartment<br> so soon after that?<br> Would you kindly ask<br> the chief attendant<br> to arrange the tables and chairs<br> so that Signor Bianchi,<br> Dr. Constantine and myself<br> can confront the passengers<br> with the solution of the murder?<br> I... I help with the risoluzione.<br> Yes, if you will briefly<br> answer two more questions.<br> Shoot.<br> On the night of the murder,<br> did Mr. Beddoes<br> leave the compartment?<br> No. No, he grunt like a pig<br> with the pain in his teeth.<br> And have you ever<br> been in private service?<br> No.<br> Thank you. That is all.<br> - Excuse me, sir.<br> - Yes.<br> Enfin, doctor?<br> This blood is human.<br> This dagger could,<br> in two different hands,<br> have inflicted all of the wounds.<br> And you know<br> who inflicted them?<br> Our last interrogation<br> will be something of a gamble.<br> But if it succeeds...<br> ...we'll know.<br> Come in, come in.<br> Please be seated.<br> You are Cyrus B. Hardman,<br> a theatrical agent.<br> No.<br> I mean, I'm...<br> I'm not a theatrical agent.<br> That's a phony, issued to me<br> under license by Pinkerton's.<br> - The detective agency?<br> - Stamboul branch.<br> Ratchett asked them for an<br> American bodyguard, they sent me.<br> I... didn't do so hot.<br> Can you prove this was<br> the reason for your journey?<br> - It's Paulette.<br> - Paulette.<br> Paulette Michel.<br> Now I can stop pretending<br> to be anything.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> may I have your attention, please.<br> May I respectfully suggest<br> that there should be no talking<br> while Monsieur Poirot addresses you.<br> If anyone wishes to make a statement,<br> he or she can do so<br> at the meeting's end.<br> Thank you.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, you are<br> all aware that a repulsive murderer<br> has himself been repulsively<br> and perhaps deservedly murdered.<br> How and why?<br> Here is the simple answer.<br> There is evidence<br> supporting the theory<br> that the murderer<br> was a stranger to us all.<br> Mrs. Hubbard was conscious<br> of a man in her compartment<br> soon after 1:15 a.m.<br> She later found near her bedside<br> the button of a wagon-lit conductor.<br> Fr?lein Schmidt discovered,<br> planted in her suitcase,<br> the uniform of a conductor,<br> which could not possibly<br> have fitted Pierre,<br> and from which, in fact,<br> there was a button missing.<br> And in the trouser<br> pocket of the uniform<br> was a conductor's passkey.<br> Later still, Mrs. Hubbard discovered<br> this bloodstained dagger,<br> which Dr. Constantine confirms<br> could have been<br> the murderer's weapon.<br> The obvious implication<br> is that the murderer,<br> disguised as a conductor,<br> boarded the train at Belgrade,<br> made his way by means<br> of the convenient passkey<br> to Ratchett's compartment,<br> stabbed him to death,<br> planted the dagger<br> and the uniform,<br> and then departed, since the train<br> was now halted in a snowdrift.<br> Who was he?<br> I am inclined to agree<br> with Mr. Foscarelli,<br> who believes that he was<br> a rival member of the Mafia,<br> exacting private vengeance<br> for a vendetta<br> whose precise nature the Yugoslav<br> police will undoubtedly identify.<br> But...<br> ...is that all?<br> - No. No, no, no, no.<br> ...is that all?<br> - No. No, no, no, no.<br> No, it is not.<br> I said, here is the simple answer.<br> There is also a more...<br> ...complex one.<br> But remember<br> my first solution when I...<br> When you've heard my second.<br> Let us, for the moment, assume<br> what is perfectly plausible,<br> that the mysterious<br> stranger did not exist.<br> The murder must then have been<br> committed by some person or persons<br> in the Calais coach and therefore<br> are present in this dining car.<br> Let us not, for the moment,<br> ask the question "how"<br> but the question "why",<br> which will tell us how.<br> I was not surprised<br> that every single one of you<br> should have heard of<br> the notorious Armstrong case.<br> But I confess to a mild surprise when<br> the first passenger I interrogated,<br> Mr. McQueen...<br> ...admitted, under emotional stress,<br> that he had actually known<br> Mrs. Armstrong, albeit very slightly.<br> She was gentle and frightened.<br> But not too frightened to take<br> an interest in a young man<br> who wanted to go on the stage.<br> Was Mr. McQueen lying<br> when he denied ever having<br> known that Ratchett<br> was Cassetti?<br> Or did he become<br> Ratchett's secretary<br> as part of a deliberate plan to avenge<br> Mrs. Armstrong's death?<br> Only by interrogating<br> the other passengers<br> could I hope to see the light.<br> But when I began<br> to question them,<br> the light, as Macbeth<br> would have said, thickened.<br> When I told the Princess<br> Dragomiroff that I knew she was<br> Mrs. Armstrong's godmother,<br> her answers to my subsequent<br> questions smelled strongly<br> of inaccuracy and evasion.<br> Even I knew more from reading<br> the newspaper reports<br> than she from her frequent visits.<br> Was there not a chauffeur?<br> There was, monsieur, but I had<br> my own. I never used him.<br> Evasion. What was the name of<br> Mrs. Armstrong's personal maid?<br> I always travel with<br> my own maid, monsieur.<br> There was no need to speak<br> with Mrs. Armstrong's.<br> Evasion. I asked for particulars<br> of the manservant.<br> He was, I think, the colonel's Indian,<br> how you would say, orderly.<br> Inaccuracy.<br> Colonel Armstrong was an officer<br> of the British army in India.<br> He would have had a British<br> batman, like Private Beddoes,<br> to serve his personal needs.<br> Only officers of the Indian army,<br> like Colonel Arbuthnott,<br> have Indian orderlies.<br> I asked her the name of<br> Mrs. Armstrong's younger sister.<br> I do not recall her name.<br> Unbelievable evasion.<br> I asked her the name<br> of Mrs. Armstrong's secretary.<br> Yes, a Miss Freebody.<br> Non, c'est impossible ?<br> The princess, it seems,<br> is playing the psychological game<br> of word association.<br> Freebody is the name<br> of the junior partner<br> of one of London's most famous<br> and most opulent ladies' stores<br> of the sort perhaps patronized<br> by the princess herself.<br> The name of the senior partner<br> is Debenham.<br> Debenham and Freebody.<br> Was the princess covering<br> up for our Miss Debenham,<br> who taught shorthand<br> in Baghdad?<br> Can she tell us the name<br> of Mrs. Armstrong's younger sister?<br> Then I will tell you her<br> Christian and her maiden name.<br> When I asked the Princess<br> Dragomiroff if she could tell me<br> the maiden name of her<br> goddaughter, Mrs. Armstrong,<br> she could not possibly,<br> as a godmother,<br> plead ignorance of this.<br> She replied...<br> Greenwood.<br> Grunwald is the German<br> for Greenwood.<br> The princess's hesitation<br> persuades me<br> that Grunwald was<br> the true maiden name<br> of her goddaughter,<br> Mrs. Armstrong.<br> And that the Countess Andrenyi<br> is Mrs. Armstrong's<br> surviving younger sister.<br> Her Christian name is Helena.<br> Not Elena. No, no, no.<br> But Helena.<br> And where did she lose<br> her Christian name's initial H?<br> She lost it under a convenient grease<br> spot in her husband's passport.<br> And why was the grease<br> spot purposely applied?<br> Because she and her<br> husband were afraid<br> that this handkerchief,<br> bearing the initial H...<br> ...might lead me to suspect her<br> of complicity in the murder.<br> I swear before God and on my<br> word of honor as a gentleman,<br> that this handkerchief<br> does not belong to my wife.<br> No, no, no, no, no, no.<br> Not at...<br> No. No.<br> No. No. No.<br> It does not.<br> No. Nor does it belong<br> to Mrs. Harriet Belinda Hubbard.<br> Nor to Fr?lein Hildegarde Schmidt,<br> whose finest quality is her loyalty.<br> The initial is wrong.<br> What is the princess's first name?<br> Natalia, mein Herr.<br> It is a Russian name.<br> In the Russian, or Cyrillic, alphabet,<br> their capital N<br> is written like our capital H.<br> Madame la Princess,<br> should this costly handkerchief<br> cease to remain an exhibit,<br> it will be returned to your<br> loyal maid for laundering.<br> Or is Hildegarde Schmidt<br> really your maid?<br> I have, perhaps, a nose for the aura<br> of fine food and laid a trap.<br> You are a good cook,<br> are you not?<br> All my ladies have said so. I...<br> If you are a lady's maid,<br> your ladies never have a chance<br> of discovering if you are a good cook.<br> As good a cook as<br> Hildegarde Schmidt must have been<br> to the Armstrong household.<br> Enfin.<br> Who do we now<br> have here in this car...<br> ...that could have known<br> or could have been involved<br> with the Armstrong household?<br> We have, one, Mr. McQueen,<br> who became boyishly<br> devoted to Mrs. Armstrong<br> at the time of the kidnapping.<br> Two, the Princess Dragomiroff,<br> who was Mrs. Armstrong's<br> devoted godmother.<br> Three, the Countess Andrenyi,<br> who was Mrs. Armstrong's<br> devoted younger sister.<br> Four, the Count Andrenyi,<br> who is Helena's devoted husband<br> and Mrs. Armstrong's<br> devoted brother-in-law.<br> Five, Hildegarde Schmidt, who was<br> Mrs. Armstrong's devoted cook.<br> Five, Hildegarde Schmidt, who was<br> Mrs. Armstrong's devoted cook.<br> Six, Mary Debenham, who was<br> Mrs. Armstrong's devoted secretary.<br> Miss Debenham's inclusion<br> is pure conjecture.<br> I did not have to ask Miss Debenham<br> if she had ever lived in America,<br> because during her<br> interrogation, she said...<br> I can always call my lawyers<br> long-distance.<br> An Englishwoman who had never<br> lived in America would have said,<br> "I can always make a trunk call<br> to my solicitors."<br> Tout de m?e, I must thank<br> the pipe-smoking Colonel Arbuthnott,<br> for a remark which finally resolved<br> all my confusions about this...<br> This extraordinary case.<br> I prefer to set aside the fact<br> that he denied ever having spoken<br> to Colonel Armstrong in India.<br> And yet he remembered<br> in great detail<br> the decorations which<br> Colonel Armstrong had won<br> years earlier in France.<br> I prefer to remember his views<br> on the British jury system.<br> Trial by 12 good men and true<br> is a sound system.<br> The iron tongue of midnight<br> hath told 12.<br> Suddenly...<br> ...the number 12 began to ring<br> in my head like a great bell.<br> Twelve.<br> Doctor, how many wounds<br> were there in Ratchett's body?<br> - Twelve.<br> - Mr. McQueen,<br> how many capital letters,<br> each inscribed by a different hand,<br> were contained in each<br> of the two threatening messages<br> you showed me on Ratchett's<br> correspondence file?<br> Twelve. Twelve.<br> Colonel Arbuthnott,<br> how many persons in a jury?<br> Twelve.<br> Pierre Paul Michel,<br> how many passengers<br> in the Calais coach,<br> excluding myself<br> and the murdered man?<br> Twelve, monsieur.<br> - Show me your wallet.<br> - No!<br> Mr. Hardman,<br> you may not speak.<br> Ratchett never asked you to be<br> his bodyguard, he asked me.<br> And I, perhaps to<br> my discredit, refused.<br> Before you joined Pinkerton's<br> as a private detective,<br> you were an ordinary policeman,<br> were you not?<br> A cop...<br> ...who, as is customary with cops,<br> fell in love with<br> a pretty housemaid<br> on his beat.<br> Yes, and would have<br> married her...<br> ...if...<br> Your daughter, Paulette,<br> never died of scarlet fever, did she?<br> No, she killed herself<br> when falsely accused<br> of complicity<br> in the kidnapping and killing<br> of little Daisy Armstrong.<br> They...<br> They could not have done it<br> without you, could they?<br> You.<br> The procurer of this disguise for<br> the mysterious member of the Mafia,<br> who never existed<br> any more than the owner<br> of this kimono existed<br> as a real character and not as a red<br> herring to confuse and deceive me.<br> Although I think<br> that I was not deceived.<br> I have, how shall I put it,<br> an eye for the...<br> For the figure<br> of a receding woman.<br> Countess, your cosmopolitan accent<br> showed an inherited ability...<br> ...from your actress mother.<br> But God knows<br> from what implausible source<br> Miss Greta Ohlsson...<br> ...learned her English vocabulary,<br> too ludicrous to be credited.<br> I was born backwards.<br> That is why I work in Africa<br> as missionary,<br> teaching little brown babies<br> more backwards than myself.<br> You coined words like "bed gown",<br> and yet you understand<br> words like "emolument".<br> I truly believe you did look after<br> little brown babies at your mission<br> in Shimoga, which is in India,<br> by the way, you know.<br> It's not Africa.<br> But I believe you<br> were covering up<br> for once, years earlier,<br> when you were in America,<br> having looked after a little<br> white baby called Daisy...<br> ...whose death, though you<br> could do nothing to prevent it,<br> so preyed on your mind that you<br> sought refuge in a vision of Jesus.<br> And your future as a missionary,<br> looking after little brown babies,<br> was sealed.<br> You. You were lucky<br> only to be bound and gagged,<br> not crushed like the manservant.<br> - Mr. Beddoes.<br> - Sir.<br> You served with the<br> British army in Scotland.<br> Colonel Armstrong<br> was in the Royal Scots.<br> Would you kindly give Dr. Constantine<br> your deepest butler's bow?<br> Yes, there is an old contusion.<br> The result of a slight fracas<br> in the mess, sir,<br> with regard to the quality of a pudding<br> known as spotted dick.<br> Thank you, but I think<br> you've been spotted too.<br> Mr. Foscarelli is very knowledgeable<br> about automobiles.<br> I suspected that perhaps he had<br> once been Armstrong's chauffeur.<br> I asked if he had ever<br> been in private service.<br> No.<br> I think Mr. Foscarelli's<br> appalling English is more genuine<br> than Miss Ohlsson's,<br> but I think he meant yes.<br> - Think, monsieur?<br> - Think, think. Yes, think!<br> What else can be done on a train<br> isolated by a snowdrift?<br> If all these people are not<br> implicated in the crime,<br> then why have they all told me,<br> under interrogation,<br> stupid and often unnecessary lies?<br> Why? Why? Why? Why?<br> Doubtless, Monsieur Poirot,<br> because they did not expect you<br> to be on the train. They had no<br> time to concert their cover story.<br> I was hoping someone<br> other than myself would say that.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> we now come<br> to my own reconstruction<br> of the night of the murder...<br> ...or the night of the red herrings.<br> I only wish...<br> I only wish I could describe it...<br> ...with the incomparable panache...<br> ...the consummate verve,<br> the enthralling cadences,<br> the delicate gestures,<br> the evocative expressions of<br> America's greatest tragic actress,<br> Harriet Belinda.<br> Miss Linda Arden.<br> I've always heard she wanted<br> to play comedy parts,<br> but her husband<br> wouldn't have it.<br> Which husband?<br> Your second husband, Mr. Hubbard?<br> Which husband?<br> Your second husband, Mr. Hubbard?<br> Or your first husband,<br> Mr. Grunwald?<br> Linda Arden, the actress,<br> never played as difficult a role<br> as Mrs. Hubbard, the organizer<br> of this extraordinary revenge.<br> Dare I deduce that the great<br> Linda Arden has been cured<br> of her incurable disease<br> and is no longer bedridden?<br> It is I who should be committed<br> to a bed in a mental home.<br> It is I who need a cure<br> for being so slow<br> to notice the tricks<br> that were being played on me<br> with regard to the time<br> of the murder.<br> - Will there be anything more, sir?<br> - There will.<br> Tell Mr. McQueen<br> I wanna see him, now.<br> Very good, sir.<br> "And six beakers, stop.<br> "Only five, repeat,<br> five beakers were delivered.<br> "One, repeat, one badly chipped,<br> "which will be returned<br> on receipt of replacement<br> "to my Paris address.<br> "Signed, Ratchett."<br> OK, Hector, that's all.<br> Good night, Mr. Ratchett.<br> Good night, Hector.<br> C'etait un cauchemar.<br> Bien, Mr. Ratchett.<br> May you now have<br> pleasant dreams.<br> At 1:15 came Mrs. Hubbard's<br> announcement<br> that there was<br> a man in her room,<br> who had, for reasons which I dare<br> not even guess, shed a button.<br> The next morning,<br> the murder was discovered.<br> Dr. Constantine sets<br> the time of the murder<br> anywhere between<br> midnight and 2 a.m.<br> Now, I came to various conclusions.<br> The clumsy clich?<br> of the smashed watch<br> registering 1:15<br> had been done deliberately<br> to excite my disbelief.<br> And since Mr. McQueen<br> had overemphatically said<br> that Ratchett spoke<br> no languages,<br> I was being deliberately<br> maneuvered into believing<br> that Ratchett was already dead<br> when a voice cried out<br> from his room in French.<br> In other words,<br> I was being forced<br> into the theory<br> that the murder was<br> committed before 1:15.<br> A period for which every single<br> one of you had an unshakable alibi.<br> But...<br> ...supposing that the crime<br> had not been committed earlier,<br> but later than 1:15...<br> ...when all the noises and incidents<br> designed to confuse me<br> had died down.<br> And I had lapsed into sleep<br> because the train was now silent...<br> ...and at peace.<br> Silent, yes.<br> At peace, no.<br> By 2:00, the murder was afoot.<br> Envisage it.<br> For my daughter.<br> My granddaughter.<br> In memory of Colonel Armstrong...<br> ...a great soldier<br> and an even greater friend.<br> And for Mrs. Armstrong.<br> They took me into their home<br> and their hearts.<br> For their Daisy and mine.<br> Oh, God, forgive me.<br> For my...<br> My sister and my...<br> ...niece.<br> Cassetti.<br> For the grief you brought<br> to my beloved wife.<br> Vigliacco.<br> Schweinehund.<br> For my beloved goddaughter.<br> For Mother Armstrong...<br> ...from Hector.<br> For my gentleman.<br> To Paulette,<br> with love.<br> And with mine,<br> God rest the soul<br> of my dear, dead daughter.<br> I repeat...<br> ...a repulsive murderer<br> has himself<br> been repulsively and, perhaps,<br> deservedly murdered.<br> But in which of the two ways<br> that I have suggested?<br> In the simpler way,<br> by the Mafioso<br> disguised as<br> a wagon-lit conductor?<br> Or in the more complex way<br> that I have just outlined...<br> ...which involves many questions<br> and, of course...<br> ...considerable scandal?<br> Signor Bianchi, it is for you,<br> as a director of the line,<br> to choose the solution that we shall<br> offer to the police at Brod.<br> Though I confess...<br> ...I am in two minds.<br> Though I...<br> I think the police at Brod<br> would prefer<br> the simplicity of the first solution.<br> We have the uniform...<br> ...to show the police.<br> If we have the uniform,<br> there must have<br> been a man in it.<br> So therefore,<br> I elect the first solution.<br> Here, here.<br> Hercule.<br> I thank you.<br> My friend.<br> Now I must go and wrestle<br> with my report to the police<br> and with my conscience.<br> Mama.<br>
