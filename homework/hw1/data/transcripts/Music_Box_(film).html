You know another way of slicing<br> nuts without being crude?<br> I'm gonna have to get crude here.<br> Go to work.<br> I just don't want you losing clients<br> because I'm working out of this office.<br> I'll work out of my<br> ex-father-in-law's office.<br> - She returns to Harry Talbot.<br> - Just for the trial.<br> Here, these are Monday's hearings.<br> - These trials last for years, Ann.<br> - Oh, not this one, Mackie.<br> Harry was in the OSS during the war,<br> you know.<br> And the OSS becomes the CIA.<br> And the CIA sets up its first little<br> spy apparatus in Europe...<br> ...by putting a bunch of Gestapo guys<br> on the payroll.<br> Word is Harry used to sip his bourbon<br> with Klaus Barbie.<br> Well, now, the word I heard was that<br> he sipped bourbon with senators.<br> He even sipped bourbon<br> in the White House a couple times.<br> I never heard anything<br> about Klaus Barbie.<br> Those are all next week.<br> Why don't you get somebody else<br> to represent your father?<br> Get that guy from Cleveland.<br> He handled that Dimuna-<br> That Demjena- That Dimjolt guy,<br> whatever his name was.<br> Take it easy.<br> He wants me to represent him.<br> What do you know about<br> ...in a part of the world<br> you've never been?<br> What do we know about our parents?<br> Oh, I know him, Mackie.<br> He raised me.<br> Have you ever thought about<br> his fantasies?<br> - How he makes love?<br> - Oh, Lord.<br> I don't understand why<br> you can't work out of here.<br> Maybe she's afraid you're gonna be<br> going through her drawers.<br> - God knows I tried.<br> - Very funny, Sandy.<br> This isn't funny, Annie.<br> This is Uncle Sam's big truck...<br> ...coming down full-bore.<br> - Hi, Harry.<br> - So we finally got you back, did we?<br> After all these years of your<br> ethnic airs about working up here.<br> Mrs. Cooper will take care<br> of everything for you. Bourbon for me.<br> Dean likes yuppie drinks. Sometimes<br> the apple falls far from the tree.<br> We got our judge.<br> - Erwin Silver.<br> - Silver, you kidding?<br> I wish a jury could hear this.<br> A daughter defending her father<br> would strike them as heartrending.<br> It's not gonna strike Erwin Silver<br> as heartrending, I'll tell you.<br> - All I know about him is that he's fair.<br> - Sure he is.<br> I don't care that he's Jewish,<br> I care that he's fair.<br> I care that he's fair.<br> In this case, I also care<br> that he's Jewish.<br> Probably lean over backwards though.<br> He'll have to.<br> You think you could claim bias?<br> Have his verdict put aside?<br> Harry, I hadn't even thought of that.<br> You don't have a prayer,<br> you know that?<br> The Holocaust is the world's<br> sacred cow.<br> Holocaust survivors<br> are secular saints.<br> You'd be better off pissing on<br> the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier...<br> ...than trying to cross-examine him.<br> - How's my grandson?<br> - Fine.<br> That's all you ever say about him.<br> " He's fine. "<br> He's fine.<br> When you've settled in, you can use my<br> secretaries, they're at your disposal.<br> By the way, Mischka didn't do it,<br> did he?<br> This is it.<br> - So I'll see you later then?<br> - Yeah.<br> Bring me a Scotch and a bottle<br> of whatever Mrs. Talbot's drinking.<br> I had a professor<br> in law school who'd say:<br> " Don't ever let a case beat you down.<br> Always trust what you feel inside. "<br> But he wasn't a litigator.<br> He was dropping pearls of wisdom<br> on young, idealistic students.<br> You're trusting your heart.<br> And you're going to get it broken.<br> What are you trusting,<br> your ambitions?<br> It must be devastating to have to read<br> those things about someone you love.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't want your condescension.<br> Come on, have a drink.<br> You've got the wrong man.<br> I wish we did.<br> You know, it's a perfect camouflage.<br> Raise a couple of all-American kids...<br> ...and you avoid even a shadow<br> of suspicion.<br> - You know, you're his perfect alibi.<br> - Yeah?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, violence runs in the family.<br> Fuck you.<br> Now, when I say go,<br> we both point to the right.<br> Go.<br> - Hey, porcupine. Come here.<br> - Hi.<br> - Dinner's ready.<br> - Point to the right, will you?<br> I'm not gonna eat.<br> How can you watch this?<br> What's the matter?<br> How would you feel, Papa,<br> if we had a Jewish judge?<br> You think it's a good idea?<br> A funny idea, that's for sure.<br> - He's a good judge.<br> - Okay. If you think so, it's okay.<br> Papa, why didn't we ever<br> have any Jewish friends?<br> How are we gonna meet?<br> Our friends, we see at church,<br> on the west side.<br> Jews live on the other side.<br> At mill, I have Jewish friends.<br> Why didn't you ever invite them<br> to the house?<br> They no invite me to come over.<br> At the university,<br> you dated a Jewish boy.<br> I told you not to date a Jewish boy.<br> Papa, tell me about<br> the Special Section.<br> Those...<br> ...killers.

He was the wrong man.<br> The wrong man.<br> The witnesses were mistaken.<br> They simply had the wrong man.<br> The judge found him innocent.<br> Yeah, so tell me about my dad.<br> Well, he goes to church,<br> to the cemetery.<br> He buys strudel at the bakery,<br> he plays checkers in the park.<br> He even makes a few bets on the Cubs<br> and the Bears games.<br> Oh, I'm gonna have to tell Karchy.<br> He's always after Karchy for betting.<br> - Do you know an Irma Kiss?<br> - Who?<br> Mrs. Irma Kiss, a widow.<br> Oh, Kiss. Yes, Irma Kiss.<br> She makes doughnuts at the church.<br> - That ain't all she makes.<br> - What?<br> Off and on for 10 years now.<br> Three, four times a month.<br> I don't believe it.<br> No.<br> Now, he doesn't spend<br> a lot of money...<br> ...but he did spend much more<br> for a while a couple of years ago...<br> ...but then I guess he learned<br> to stick to $10 bets.<br> - Who's Tibor Zoldan?<br> - I don't know.<br> Mike wrote him a $2000 check<br> three years ago.<br> It's the biggest check<br> he's ever written.<br> This group he belongs to,<br> the Attila Circle...<br> ...it's just a bunch of little old guys<br> who drag out the picket signs...<br> ...whenever some dimwit<br> Communist diplomat...<br> ...makes the mistake<br> of coming over here.<br> Honestly, Ann, I don't think there's<br> no devil here to advocate.<br> What?<br> Irma Kiss.<br> Papa, who's Tibor Zoldan?<br> A friend from the refugee camp.<br> He went back to the old country,<br> then he came here.<br> I gave him some money<br> to get started...<br> ...and he got himself killed<br> in a car accident...<br> ...and then I didn't<br> get my money back.<br> Are you ready?<br> I've spent my whole life<br> trying to forget what I saw.<br> - Now I have to remember.<br> - We have to do this, Papa.<br> All right, let's begin with Mrs. Kiss.<br> Irma Kiss?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Damn lawyers.<br> They find out everything.<br> Papa, why didn't you<br> ever marry her?<br> I couldn't marry anyone<br> after your mama.<br> You didn't need another mama.<br> How about you?<br> You meet anybody<br> since you got divorced?<br> Well, yeah.<br> I mean, I've met a few men.<br> What about Dean?<br> Yeah. What about Dean?<br> He's a nice man.<br> - And he still loves you, Annie.<br> - Okay.<br> Tell me how you joined<br> the gendarmes.<br> Papa was a peasant.<br> We were very poor.<br> I didn't go to school. No money.<br> I liked the gendarme.<br> They paid good,<br> had a nice uniform...<br> ...with a feather on the hat.<br> And the music.<br> - Hello.<br> - Well, hello.<br> So you wanna take a swing at me this<br> time? Is that why you invited me here?<br> Look, I've always had a working<br> relationship with the other side.<br> We just got off on the wrong foot.<br> The night before court, you wanna<br> work on the working relationship.<br> Terrific.<br> What do you really want?<br> My father was manager<br> of a restaurant.<br> - Yeah?<br> - But he didn't have music like this.<br> And the room wasn't near<br> as pretty as this.<br> Yeah. I...<br> I wasn't too keen on the smell<br> of grilled onions...<br> ...so after I got my degree,<br> I became a-<br> I worked for the county<br> as an assistant to the DA.<br> And after a while...<br> ...Uncle Sam came after me.<br> Here I am, and here we are.<br> Cheers.<br> So how does a Laszlo<br> become a Talbot?<br> It's easy to fall in love when you've<br> got something in common.<br> Oh, yeah? Like what?<br> Like he didn't wanna be<br> a Talbot anymore...<br> ...and I didn't want to stay a Laszlo.<br> Sounds like heaven.<br> So, what happened?<br> With all these lofty ambitions?<br> It was a big move from<br> Damon Avenue to Lake Forest.<br> I guess I never quite got there.<br> What is this stuff? It's unusual, huh?<br> It's good, but it's different.<br> It's called Bull's Blood.<br> It kind of sneaks up on you.<br> Clobbers you.<br> I bet.<br> - It's a Hungarian trait.<br> - Really?<br> I heard about your wife. I'm sorry.<br> You must've felt very bad.<br> Yes. It was...<br> ...a terrible accident.<br> The police report said<br> you were drunk.<br> It must not have been very easy<br> to cover up.<br> You know, I liked you, Mrs. Talbot.<br> Now I think I must have<br> misjudged you.<br> You are your father's daughter.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to upset you.<br> Yes, you did.<br> You find the soft spot,<br> then you like to turn the knife.<br> So didn't joining legal aid<br> ease the guilt, Jack?<br> What if going after war criminals<br> doesn't do it either?<br> What are you gonna do then?<br> You're gonna find Jesus.<br> You're gonna get yourself born-again?<br> Do you honestly think you need<br> a self-serving reason...<br> ...to justify prosecuting<br> war criminals?<br> I think maybe you should get<br> another lawyer, Mrs. Talbot.<br> Maybe a real lawyer<br> to defend your father.<br> One who's not emotionally involved.<br> If you like, I'll accept<br> a postponement while you...<br> ...get a replacement.<br> And by the way...<br> ...they never pressed charges<br> because there was no case.<br> I was innocent.<br> But they could've pressed charges,<br> couldn't they, Jack?<br> They could've built a case<br> if they wanted to.<br> Just like you're doing<br> with my father.<br> I fail to see how you can equate<br> one with the other, Mrs. Talbot...<br> ...but maybe you can in court.<br> Good evening.<br> I hope you enjoy your dinner.<br> Smile, Papa.<br> How can I smile? I'm scared.<br> I'm going to pee in my pants.<br> Papa, I want you to be<br> real friendly with Georgine.<br> Talk to her. Smile at her.<br> Mike Laszlo.<br> Six million lies!<br> We're behind you, Mike!<br> God be with you.<br> Mike is innocent.<br> Mike is innocent.<br> Any statement, Mrs. Talbot?<br> Hi. Hi. Annie.<br> Annie, can I sit up here<br> with you guys?<br> Karchy. Give Karchy a hug.<br> - I saw him this morning.<br> - Give him a hug.<br> - Okay.

Laszlo...<br> ...lied on his application<br> for American citizenship...<br> ...and was granted that citizenship<br> under false pretences.<br> His citizenship, consequently,<br> must be taken away.<br> He lied in order to hide the fact...<br> ...that in the latter months of 1944<br> and the early months of 1945...<br> ...he served as a member of an<br> SS-organized Hungarian death squad...<br> ...known as Arrow Cross.<br> Also called the Special Section...<br> ...a unit of the Hungarian gendarmes.<br> Mr. Laszlo committed crimes<br> so heinous that the mind boggles...<br> ...trying to comprehend them.<br> We are not speaking here<br> of the banality of evil...<br> ...of an anonymous bureaucrat<br> sitting in an office giving orders...<br> ...or a gendarme executing orders.<br> We are speaking of a man...<br> ...who committed these heinous crimes<br> with his own hands.<br> We are speaking of evil incarnate.<br> Thank you, Your Honour.<br> - Your Honour, if it please the court.<br> - Mrs. Talbot.<br> - Counsel.<br> - Mrs. Talbot.<br> Your Honour...<br> ...the issue here is not<br> whether my father lied...<br> ...on his application<br> for American citizenship.<br> That is a smoke screen.<br> Yes. My father did lie.<br> But he did so because he did not<br> want to be repatriated...<br> ...by a Communist government<br> that either executed...<br> ...or sent to work camps<br> all those who opposed it.<br> My father was a gendarme.<br> But he was not a member<br> of the Special Section.<br> My father worked as a clerk<br> in an office.<br> He requested that assignment<br> because he could not tolerate...<br> ...the brutalities that he witnessed<br> his fellow gendarmes commit.<br> My father is simply an innocent man<br> who is unjustly accused.<br> He is a man who is<br> being punished by proxy...<br> ...by a Communist government<br> for an action he committed...<br> ...against representatives<br> of that government five years ago.<br> - Your Honour, with your permission.<br> - You may.<br> Would you please?<br> At an appearance here of the<br> Hungarian National Folk Dancers...<br> ...a group belonging<br> to the Communist government...<br> ...my father forced<br> the performance to halt.<br> The tour was cancelled,<br> my father was arrested.<br> Charges were later dismissed.<br> The Hungarian government<br> lodged an official protest...<br> ...over the dismissal of those charges.<br> The State Department<br> rejected that protest.<br> His action was a demonstration<br> against the repressive policies...<br> ...of the Communist government.<br> Policies which resulted...<br> ...in the deaths of 15,000 people during<br> the Hungarian revolution of 1956.<br> My father is a good man.<br> He's the kind of man who is willing<br> to put himself at risk against injustice.<br> I know that, Your Honour.<br> And before this trial is over,<br> I will prove it to you.<br> Thank you.<br> Yeah.<br> You may call your first witness,<br> Mr. Burke.<br> I'm employed by the United States<br> Department of Justice...<br> ...the Immigration and<br> Naturalization Service...<br> ...at the Forensic Document Laboratory<br> in McLean, Virginia.<br> I'm a senior forensic<br> document examiner.<br> Now, what is the date<br> of the Arrow Cross...<br> ...Special Section<br> identification card?<br> November 1, 1944.<br> Now, what is the date<br> of the immigration card...<br> ...issued upon arrival<br> to the United States...<br> ...the so-called green card?<br> February 12, 1952.<br> Mr. Nathanson...<br> ...what is your conclusion<br> concerning the two documents?<br> My conclusion is that the<br> photographs are of the same man...<br> ...and the signatures<br> are of the same man:<br> Michael J. Laszlo.<br> Did you conduct an examination<br> as to the authenticity...<br> ...of the government exhibit one,<br> the Special Section ID card?<br> Objection, Your Honour.<br> Government exhibit one is not<br> a Special Section identification card.<br> It is a Photostat of a Special<br> Section identification card.<br> Sustained.<br> I conducted a full-phase examination<br> of the Photostat I was provided...<br> ...to determine whether there'd been<br> alteration in any form.<br> What methods did you use?<br> I studied the document under<br> low-power stereoscopic microscope...<br> ...to determine background tone.<br> In addition, I did a photo study<br> and handwriting analysis...<br> ...using all scientifically<br> accepted methods.<br> And what is your conclusion,<br> Mr. Nathanson?<br> The exhibit is authentic<br> in my opinion.<br> Your witness.<br> Mr. Nathanson...<br> ...when you say you did a photo study,<br> you mean you did a photo study...<br> - ... of a Photostat, isn't that correct?<br> - Yes.<br> Your Honour, may I approach<br> the witness?<br> Yes.<br> The fact that government exhibit<br> number one is a Photostat...<br> ...and not the document itself,<br> did that hinder you in any way?<br> I felt I was not restricted<br> by the Photostat.<br> But would you have felt more<br> confident in your conclusions...<br> ...if you were dealing with<br> the ID card itself?<br> I feel confident in my conclusions<br> without it.<br> Mr. Nathanson, when analysing<br> a Photostat...<br> ...to authenticate a document...<br> ...is it possible to consider<br> the texture of the original document?<br> A Photostat examined<br> microscopically...<br> ...would show any alteration<br> in the paper.<br> Can you authenticate the age<br> of the paper with a Photostat?<br> - Indirectly, yes.<br> - Indirectly?<br> - Yes.<br> - But the only way to authenticate it...<br> ...directly is by having<br> the original document.<br> Yes.<br> So, Mr. Nathanson, your conclusions<br> here today are not definitive, are they?<br> In my opinion, they are.<br> - In your opinion?<br> - Yes.<br> Mr. Nathanson, are you Jewish?<br> Objection, Your Honour. The witness's<br> religion is not relevant here.<br> It relates directly, Your Honour,<br> to his objectivity as a witness.<br> He just stated he was offering<br> an opinion.<br> He offered conclusions<br> based on 30 years of experience...<br> - ... in the Justice Department.<br> - Overruled.<br> You may answer the question.<br> I'm Unitarian.<br> But I am part Jewish<br> on my father's side.<br> - Yeah.<br> - No further questions, Your Honour.<br> - Mr. Burke?<br> - Nothing further, Your Honour.<br> We will adjourn until<br> tomorrow morning.<br> First witness, and her bottom line is,<br> "Are you Jewish?"<br> Yes!<br> Georgine, find out where the witnesses<br> from Hungary are staying.<br> I wanna know who they see<br> and what they talk about.<br> They're gonna be speaking<br> Hungarian.<br> I understand Hungarian.<br> Don't I, Papa?<br> You wear a suit tomorrow.

This is fresh.<br> Oh, Mikey. Why do you watch them?<br> They're so violent.<br> - No, they're not. They're funny.<br> - No, they're stupid.<br> Can I go to the trial with you?<br> It's not for kids, honey.<br> I already know all about<br> that stuff anyway.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Grandpa told me all about it.<br> What did he tell you?<br> It's a secret<br> just between him and me.<br> You can't tell me?<br> He said it's all a big exaggeration.<br> The Holocaust and stuff.<br> It's all made-up.<br> He said that?<br> You're not gonna say anything,<br> are you?<br> Keep that on your eye.<br> - Just keep it on your eye.<br> - Wise guy. I'll plank him.<br> Turn this off, Mikey.<br> You've got homework.<br> - That was a stupid thing to say.<br> - What did I say?<br> What you said to Mikey<br> about the Holocaust.<br> - I didn't say anything to him.<br> - Don't lie to me, Papa.<br> - I'm not lying to you.<br> - He just told me.<br> He didn't!<br> Grandpa Talbot.<br> You said you wouldn't say anything!<br> All rise.<br> - Come, sit up here.<br> - Please be seated.<br> Just keep your mouth shut today.<br> Call your next witness, Mr. Burke.<br> May we see you in chambers,<br> Your Honour?<br> You may.<br> All rise.<br> - What's going on, Annie?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What's going on, Pop?<br> - I don't know.<br> I have some good news,<br> Your Honour.<br> The Hungarian government<br> has turned over...<br> ...the Special Section ID card itself<br> to the Justice Department labs.<br> Maybe that will clarify everything.<br> Do you have a problem with that,<br> Mrs. Talbot?<br> No, Your Honour.<br> It's funny. I score some points<br> on one of your witnesses...<br> ...and they throw something<br> in the pot from Budapest.<br> They prosecuting the case,<br> or are you?<br> Come on. We've been working<br> for months...<br> ...through the embassies<br> to get the original card.<br> The way you've been carrying<br> on about Photostat...<br> ...you should be jumping with joy.<br> I'll let your forensic-documents man<br> examine it first.<br> - Will a week be sufficient?<br> - Yes, Your Honour. Thank you.<br> Mrs. Hollo, tell us what happened...<br> ...on the afternoon<br> of January the 11th, 1945.<br> I worked at the steam dry cleaners.<br> I left work early that day because<br> the bombings were especially heavy.<br> Do you approve<br> of the translation, Papa?<br> - All the buildings were on fire.<br> - Yeah.<br> There was smoke everywhere.<br> The air-raid sirens were on.<br> It was at Kalvin's Square<br> where I saw them.<br> Who did you see?<br> I saw three men in black uniforms.<br> I knew they were Special Section<br> Arrow Cross.<br> - This one can't even speak English.<br> - Karchy.<br> Karchy.<br> Shut up.<br> They were talking to my neighbour,<br> Mrs. Canter, and her 10-year-old son.<br> Then one of them yelled<br> at the woman, "You gypsy whore.<br> - What are you doing here?"<br> - What did Mrs. Canter say?<br> She started to cry and she said,<br> " No, I'm not a gypsy. "<br> Then he yelled at her,<br> " If you're not a Jew...<br> ...tell your boy to say<br> the 'Our Father. "'<br> She started to cry so hard<br> she couldn't even speak.<br> And the others just laughed.<br> It's all right. Take your time.<br> What happened?<br> He shot her in the head.<br> Then the boy threw himself<br> on top of her...<br> ...and then he shot the boy<br> in the head also.<br> Then one of them said,<br> " Mischka, let's get out of here. "<br> And they just walked away.<br> He called him Mischka?<br> Yes.<br> Mrs. Hollo...<br> ...is this the man...<br> ...that shot the mother and the boy?<br> Yes. This is the man.<br> He walked right by me<br> when they left.<br> He was so close I could have<br> reached out and touched him.<br> No further questions, Your Honour.<br> Your witness.<br> Mrs. Hollo, you must have<br> an amazing memory...<br> ...to recognize a face you saw only<br> briefly 40 years ago.<br> - Your Honour?<br> - Yes.<br> Mrs. Hollo...<br> ...did you place a phone call<br> to Budapest last night?<br> Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.<br> This woman is not on trial here.<br> Relates to the witness' state<br> of mind.<br> The witness' state of mind<br> is not the issue here.<br> - I will allow it.
