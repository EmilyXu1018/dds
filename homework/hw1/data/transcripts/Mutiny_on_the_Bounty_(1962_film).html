                        Eight o'clock.<br> All's well. Misty weather.<br> - Here ye are, me lad.<br> - Thank ye.<br> A press gang. A press gang!<br> - The press gang!<br> - Let's get out of here!<br> In the king's name!<br> Well, we got all the fish<br> we need in one net.<br> - Line them up, boatswain.<br> - Aye, aye. Line up, lads!<br> Lads, bow your necks and weep.<br> You're in the king's navy.<br> I'm no seaman, sir. I'm a tailor.<br> What's that, your needlework?<br> No chin music.<br> - What ship, sir?<br> - The Bounty, for the South Seas.<br> - That's the end of the world.<br> - No, he sailed there with Captain Cook.<br> He knows the brown gals<br> gay as kiss-me.<br> - Who's the captain?<br> - Bligh.<br> - Bligh!<br> - Seize him!<br> How long will we be gone?<br> Till there's enough frost<br> in hell to kill snap beans.<br> How long is that, sir?<br> I've got to know.<br> - Two years, lad.<br> - Please, don't take my husband.<br> When we had a baby,<br> Tommy left the sea.<br> He don't want to serve in the navy.<br> - It's true, sir.<br> - Sorry, the king needs six men.<br> You can't take him! It's like forever!<br> I can't take them and not take him.<br> No, you can't take him!<br> I won't let you!<br> - Lass, lass.<br> - It's two years! No! It's two years!<br> This is England's new venture<br> in science, in trade, in discovery.<br> Who else but Sir Austin Byam's<br> son should go?<br> But two years.<br> - I understand, my dear.<br> - Ship ahoy!<br> Bob.<br> Behold! The elder son of the sea<br> and heir to all its oceans.<br> Uniform by Jeeves.<br> It's so new, it creaks.<br> I'll come back an admiral,<br> with a necklace for you.<br> Pearls as big as coconuts.<br> I'll name a nice shiny island<br> after you, Sir Joseph.<br> - I owe you for my appointment.<br> - You've been appointed for one purpose:<br> To make me a dictionary<br> of the Tahitian language.<br> I've made that clear to Captain Bligh.<br> - What's he like, sir?<br> - Captain Bligh?<br> He's a seagoing disaster.<br> His hair is rope yarn.<br> His teeth are marlinespikes.<br> Marlinespikes? Good.<br> Sounds rather terrifying. But perhaps,<br> as your father used to say:<br> "A taut hand at sea is better<br> than a slack one."<br> You'd have made a rare sailor, ma'am.<br> Why don't you stow away, Mother?<br> I've considered it. Very seriously.<br> Well, here's to the voyage<br> of the Bounty.<br> To the voyage of the Bounty!<br> Still waters and the great golden sea.<br> Flying fish like streaks of silver<br> and mermaids that sing in the night.<br> The Southern Cross, and all the stars<br> on the other side of the world.<br> Bless my soul.<br> To the voyage of the Bounty!<br> Is that the Bounty?<br> No, sir. That's the flagship of the fleet.<br> There's your little pint-pot.<br> That's the Bounty for Tahiti?<br> She isn't very big, is she?<br> It ain't the size that counts, youngster.<br> It's the salt in the lads that man it.<br> - Where's your sweetheart, handsome?<br> - She married a sailor.<br> It's Ellison, sir.<br> He tried to break ship.<br> On deck, Morrison. Churchill.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Break ship, would you?<br> I can't face it, sir. Not two years.<br> I might not come back.<br> Then she's left with the baby.<br> Flog me, send me to jail,<br> but don't take me, sir!<br> Don't.<br> Now, listen to me, Ellison.<br> The sea's hard, but you whistle it off.<br> Do your spit and polish and you'll<br> come home with the seals...<br> ...following in admiration.<br> I was like you when I first came to sea,<br> Cumberland moss all over me.<br> Now it's turned to barnacles.<br> That's better.<br> On this voyage, if you get in trouble,<br> come to me. I'll see you get justice.<br> But if you're wrong,<br> look out for squalls.<br> Now, get your chin up.<br> Go on deck. Say goodbye to your wife.<br> - You've got her aboard, sir?<br> - And the baby.<br> - Come on. Shake a leg.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - So you're going to the South Seas?<br> - Aye.<br> Here. Take this with you.<br> You can buy your own island.<br> Ten shillings.<br> Ten? I ain't seen the king's face<br> on a shilling for so long...<br> ...I've forgotten which George it is, but<br> I'll take it and pay you when I get back.<br> Sailor! You're not coming back,<br> not in this little half-walnut.<br> Here you are. Diamond brooch.<br> Real gold, mister,<br> owned by Captain Kidd.<br> With a map of the treasure<br> under the works.<br> Here. Stand clear with the tinware, Joe.<br> You keep leeward<br> of the ship's gentlemen.<br> All right, now. Ta-ta. Ta-ta!<br> Mr. Byam? I'm Fletcher Christian,<br> lieutenant and master's mate.<br> - You'll be my instructor.<br> - Yes, in navigation and trigonometry.<br> You'll have a watch, keep order,<br> go aloft to mend canvas, reef and furl.<br> Otherwise, your time is your own.<br> Mr. Christian, in my hands,<br> the ship is safe.<br> I understand.<br> "A little child shall lead them."<br> Come along, I'll show you below. You<br> there, take Mr. Byam's box to his berth.<br> - Ahoy, Mr. Christian!<br> - Ahoy!<br> Excuse me.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.<br> Think I've got enough<br> for a two years' voyage?<br> - You know your draft better than I do.<br> - My lad, nobody can estimate my draft...<br> ...least of all myself.<br> - Easy, easy.<br> - What makes her roll so?<br> Here's a navy for you.<br> Rum in the skimmers today<br> and blood in the scuppers tomorrow.<br> This is our ship's surgeon.<br> We call him Mr. Bacchus.<br> - He's never told us his real name.<br> - I've forgotten it.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> Mr. Byam, I should never<br> have gone ashore.<br> England's only an island,<br> and all islands are alike.<br> I'm going below. Bear a hand.<br> Easy, now. Easy.<br> Oh, Tommy, I'm afeard.<br> This ship's unlucky.<br> They've changed the name.<br> Well, I changed your name, didn't I?<br> Was that unlucky?<br> Oh, Tommy.<br> One, two...<br> Three of us in here?<br> My dog at home has a bigger<br> kennel all to himself.<br> I can see we shall be as friendly<br> as tomcats in a sack.<br> Mr. Stewart? Mr. Byam.<br> Drop in anytime, Byam.<br> I'll be just 10 inches away from you.<br> - A pleasure, Mr. Stewart.<br> - I hope you'll like the ship.<br> - I'd like any ship, Mr. Stewart.<br> - Johnny Newcomer.<br> Oh, yes, Mr. Byam,<br> the amiable Mr. Hayward.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Mr. Hayward has been two years at sea.<br> And a man who's been two years at sea<br> should know how to lash his hammock.<br> Yours looks like<br> a Frenchman's knapsack.<br> All right. On deck, all of you.<br> Mr. Maggs?<br> This here Captain Bligh, sir.<br> Now, you being ship's clerk...<br> ...would you call him a gentle officer?<br> If I was you, I wouldn't be<br> calling him anything.<br> Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Maggs, no.<br> Never call anybody anything.<br> But I do hope he is gentle because I'm<br> his messman and I frighten so easy.<br> It runs in our family, Mr. Maggs.<br> My mother was frightened by<br> my father before I was born...<br> ...and I've been frightened ever since.<br> Do you know there's times when<br> I can hardly hold a glass in my hand?<br> Silence. The captain's coming aboard.<br> Company, atten!<br> Mr. Christian, clear the decks<br> of this rabble.<br> Very good, sir. Clear decks.<br> Everybody ashore. Clear decks.<br> - Mr. Fryer, we sail at six bells.<br> - Sail at six bells.<br> - We got our rights here.<br> - Off ship, Joe. Off ship.<br> I'm not going until the ship sails.<br> Hey, you can't do that!<br> Flogging through the fleet.<br> We're included.<br> Quite a compliment to<br> the Bounty, Sir Joseph.<br> Mr. Christian, pipe the ship's company<br> at five bells to witness punishment.<br> Would you care to see the flogging?<br> No. The only discipline<br> I know is science.<br> There's science in using a<br> cat-o'-nine-tails. Watch my boatswain.<br> I really must be off.<br> I came aboard merely to introduce Roger.<br> Goodbye, my boy.<br> This won't be all cakes and ale, Roger...<br> ...but your family's followed the sea<br> for seven generations.<br> Not one ever failed in his duty.<br> In a tight place,<br> that's all you'll need to remember.<br> - I'll try to, sir.<br> - Sure you will, my boy.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Bligh.<br> - Goodbye, Sir Joseph.<br> What does it mean, sir,<br> "flogging through the fleet"?<br> Sentence of court-martial,<br> two dozen lashes at each ship.<br> What was the man's crime, sir?<br> Struck his captain.<br> But that's over 300 lashes.<br> I don't understand why...<br> Can you understand this?<br> Discipline's the thing.<br> A seaman's a seaman, captain's<br> a captain. And a midshipman...<br> ...is the lowest form of animal life<br> in the British navy.<br> Now you know what<br> a midshipman is.<br> Line up!<br> Port oars!<br> Ship's company, off hats!<br> Article 22: "If any officer, mariner<br> or other person in the fleet...<br> ...shall strike or offer to strike<br> any of his superiors...<br> ...and being convicted,<br> he shall suffer punishment...<br> ...inflicted on him by<br> the sentence of a court-martial."<br> Ship's company, on hats!<br> - Mr. Morrison, two dozen, I believe.<br> - Two dozen it is, sir.<br> - The man is dead, sir.<br> - Dead?<br> - Shall I dismiss the men, sir?<br> - What?<br> Certainly not.<br> We'll proceed with punishment.<br> Boatswain, do your duty.<br> Come along with you. Do your duty!<br> Bloody murderer.<br> Mr. Byam!<br> - Punishment counted out, sir.<br> - Mr. Morrison, come aboard.<br> - Mr. Fryer, make ready to sail.<br> - Starboard watch, secure for sea.<br> Starboard watch, shorten and cable!<br> Stand by to go aloft!<br> In captain's gig, Mr. Christian.<br> Both watches, hoist!<br> Hoist away!<br> Way aloft!<br> Winds offshore!<br> You'll take the mizzenmast, Mr. Byam.<br> What's the matter, afraid to go aloft?<br> Why, it's child's play.<br> That man they flogged.<br> He was dead.<br> Get aloft. Bear a hand.<br> Mr. Morrison, start those men.<br> Tallyho!<br> Child's play.<br> Anchors aweigh, sir.<br> Let fall!<br> Down from aloft!<br> Down from there! A dozen for<br> the coat of the last man down!<br> Please, sir!<br> Skipper Hayward!<br> Mr. Hayward!<br> - I'll take care of him.<br> - Keep hold!<br> Hoist away!<br> Set courses, royals and gallants!<br> Royals and gallants!<br> Starboard bridges,<br> aweigh with the anchors.<br> - Ship ready.<br> - Give her lee helm.<br> Lee helm, sir.<br> - Steady.<br> - Steady, sir.<br> There she goes. Her anchor's up.<br> Oh, Mary, it's such a little ship.<br> My Tommy will bring her home.<br> Hurrah!<br> Hurrah!<br> Hurrah!<br> Well, we're under canvas again,<br> Mr. Christian.<br> - It's our third voyage together.<br> - Not of my choosing.<br> So the port admiral told me.<br> Well, you're here. I requested you.<br> I like having a gentleman as my<br> subordinate, being a self-made man.<br> I admire you for that, sir.<br> And for very little else?<br> Sailing orders?<br> Tahiti direct by Cape Horn.<br> Winds permitting.<br> If we can't make westing,<br> we shall have to go by Africa.<br> Then we'll have to get<br> supplies at Simon's Bay.<br> We'll need them. This ship has<br> less food than a prison hull.<br> And I don't trust that clerk of yours.<br> Who asked you to meddle<br> with my clerk?<br> Can't get much from a hungry man.<br> I have to work these men we feed.<br> Rascals and pirates.<br> Did you see them growl at the flogging?<br> I'll teach them what flogging's like.<br> My advice, sir, if you'll take it,<br> is not to be too harsh with them.<br> We're sailing 10,000 miles together<br> for the next two years.<br> - It's like a powder magazine.<br> - I don't want your advice.<br> I've my own way with seamen.<br> They respect one law, the law of fear.<br> - My officers should remember that.<br> - I can only tell you what I think!<br> They come from jails and taverns, but<br> they're English and they'll sail anywhere.<br> I'm not interested in what you think.<br> I expect you to carry out whatever<br> orders I give, whenever I give them.<br> I'll carry out your orders, Mr. Bligh.<br> Then we understand each other?<br> Perfectly.<br> - Any orders for the deck?<br> - No.<br> - That all?<br> - Yes. You may go.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - She's flying, Mr. Christian.<br> - Tahiti direct, sir.<br> Tahiti direct, Mr. Christian.<br> Pass it on: No change of<br> sail without my orders.<br> Put two men at the wheel.<br> We'll carry on or carry under.<br> - Southeast by east.<br> - Southeast by east, sir.<br> No change in sails except<br> for captain's orders.<br> Mr. Byam, you'll stand by<br> for midshipman's school.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> You! Hold up, there!<br> Never empty your buckets into the wind!<br> Find the wind, you idiot!<br> Find the wind and then choose your rail.<br> Get below!<br> We're off around the world, boys.<br> Light hearts and tight britches.<br> Off around the world.<br> Oh, dry up, you cub.<br> Is it human, or what do you think?<br> I can't stand yowling water babies.<br> Blast you! I told you not<br> to swing that lantern!<br> You don't mean it makes you seasick?<br> An old buccaneer like you?<br> I'll knock more tar out of you<br> than it'll take a month to mix.<br> - Come on, blowhard.<br> - Oh, stow it, will you?<br> I can't make head or tail<br> of this navigation.<br> Don't worry. If you get tangled,<br> I'll jump in and pull you out.<br> You'd better not try and fool<br> Mr. Christian.<br> Mr. Christian holds no terrors for me.<br> I can wade the seven seas<br> and never wet my shirt.<br> They have whales that can sink a ship,<br> but I can sink the whale.<br> Behold, the face that launched<br> a thousand ships.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Today's navigating problem:<br> Given the altitude of Polaris, could you<br> find your latitude, Mr. Stewart?<br> To lead up to it...<br> ...ordinarily, the shortest distance<br> between two points is a straight line.<br> But this is not true of navigation.<br> We must consider winds and currents...<br> Yes. Suppose you considered<br> the problem.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it's...<br> ...like that lantern, sir.<br> We assume it should hang straight<br> down, but because the ship is rolling...<br> ...it swings to and fro.<br> But by watching it closely...<br> You disagree with Byam, Mr. Hayward?<br> He knows the lantern makes me seasick.<br> He's doing it to break up the lesson.<br> - Stewart doesn't know his problem.<br> - Still, his original theory interests me.<br> Please, sir.<br> Proceed, Mr. Byam. You were saying,<br> by watching the lantern closely...<br> What seems to be the trouble,<br> Mr. Stewart?<br> Watch the wind, Mr. Stewart.<br> It's not there. It's there.<br> Is that the face that launched<br> a thousand ships?<br> One navigation problem<br> and three wrecks.<br> Smart as paint, you are.<br> Why, you ungrateful swab.<br> After I've given my all<br> for the honor of the class.<br> Byam!<br> It wasn't my fault.<br> He came behind and struck me.<br> - Is that true, Mr. Byam?<br> - I'd rather not say, sir.<br> So you want to fight?<br> I'll cool you off.<br> Get to the masthead and stay<br> there until I call you down.<br> - All the way, sir?<br> - All the way.<br> - Get below or go aloft!<br> - Yes, sir!<br> Rather heavy weather<br> to send him aloft, isn't it?<br> They must learn this isn't a beer garden.<br> If you don't teach them, I will!<br> Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!<br> - Where's Byam?<br> - I couldn't help it, Stewart.<br> When the man looks at me,<br> I want to jump overboard.<br> Where's Byam?<br> - The old man sent him aloft.<br> - You let him take the blame, huh?<br> Here, here!<br> You've started enough trouble!<br> Time you learn discipline!<br> Get into your hammock<br> before I put you over a gun!<br> Get up!<br> You see, sir? It isn't my fault.<br> They're only jealous because<br> I've been at sea before.<br> Who did that?<br> I did, sir.<br> Come here.<br> Good.<br> How she creaks. Wind's a gale.<br> I'm too old to envy young Byam aloft.<br> - Splice the main-brace, Mr. Morgan.<br> - I'll take it to kill germs.<br> What? Waste my brandy?<br> Here, you use the ship's drinking water.<br> It would shrivel me wooden leg.<br> Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?<br> - No, no, but we will.<br> - Well...<br> - I'm worried about Byam.<br> - Oh, he'll weather it all right.<br> Well, I left my leg with<br> John Paul Jones back in '78.<br> We came astern with a Yankee.<br> Up went our colors and our captain hails,<br> "What ship is that?"<br> "American ship Ranger," roars Jones,<br> and up go his colors.<br> "Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak,"<br> our captain yells.<br> "I can't hear you!"<br> "Can you hear this?" says Jones,<br> and he lets go a broadside.<br> Thundering guns.<br> You all right?<br> - Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.<br> - Look after him, Mr. Morgan.<br> Keep her head up!<br> Starboard!<br> Get him below, to the surgeon!<br> Mr. Christian!<br> - Who brought that man down?<br> - I did, sir!<br> But I sent him aloft!<br> He's gone under. The top's no place.<br> I know his place. Time you knew yours.<br> Maintain discipline, not break it!<br> Send him aloft again!<br> Mr. Bligh, he's had enough!<br> Send him aloft again!<br> That's right, lad. Drink another.<br> You'll be as right as a truism.<br> If you'd lost a leg, now...<br> I lost mine in action against<br> the French, off Jamaica.<br> A French surgeon did the trick for me.<br> He apologized in French,<br> and I cursed him in English.<br> - How is he?<br> - I'm all right, sir.<br> He'll go anywhere.<br> Get to the masthead again, Byam.<br> - I've taken my punishment, sir.<br> - Get to the masthead!<br> I've had a bellyful of that masthead<br> from Captain Bligh!<br> You can't make me go<br> back up there again!<br> It was Mr. Christian<br> brought you down, lad.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I didn't understand. Captain's orders.<br> - You mind?<br> - No. Let him have it.<br> Here, you'll need this.<br> Here's something else you'll need.<br> You're a plucky youngster.<br> If necessary, I'd be happy<br> to cut off your leg anytime.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Lf anything happens to that lad, Bligh...<br> - Christian!<br> Christian, careful!<br> Ship's company, off hats.<br> O, eternal god, who alone<br> spreadest out the heavens...<br> ...and rulest the raging sea, who has<br> compassed the waters with bounds...<br> ...until night and day come to an end...<br> ...receive into thy almighty<br> and most gracious protection...<br> ...the persons of us, thy servants<br> and the fleet in which we serve.<br> Preserve us from the dangers of the sea<br> that we may be a safeguard...<br> ...unto our gracious lord<br> King George and his kingdoms...<br> ...and a security for such as pass on<br> the seas upon their lawful occasions...<br> ...and that we may return in safety<br> to enjoy the blessings of the land...<br> ...with a remembrance of thy mercies<br> to praise and glorify thy holy name...<br> ...through Jesus Christ our lord, amen.<br> - Amen.<br> - Ship's company, on hats.<br> The ship's company<br> will bear in mind...<br> ...we are at sea<br> under the articles of war.<br> Perhaps you are unaware<br> that the articles of war invest in me...<br> ...the authority to order punishment.<br> During the recent heavy weather, I've<br> watched you at work on deck and aloft.<br> You don't know wood from canvas, and<br> it seems that you don't want to learn.<br> Well, I'll have to give you a lesson.<br> You, you, you, step forward.<br> You three are<br> a disgrace to saltwater!<br> Ten days on half rations.<br> What's your name?<br> - Thomas Burkitt, sir.<br> - He's a thief, sir. Dartmoor Prison.<br> - A thief.<br> - Convicted. Offered a choice:<br> Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy.<br> You've been to Dartmoor Prison, Burkitt?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - It seems you prefer the navy.<br> You may regret that choice<br> before this voyage is over. Your name?<br> Thomas Ellison, sir. Pressed into service.<br> I've got a wife, a baby.<br> I asked your name, not the history<br> of your misfortunes. Your name?<br> - Smith.<br> - Not you, you idiot! You.<br> - William Muspratt, sir.<br> - Have you got a wife, Muspratt?<br> Have you got a wife?<br> Two, sir.<br> The ship's company will remember that<br> I am your captain, judge and your jury.<br> You do your duty<br> and we may get along...<br> ...but whatever happens,<br> you'll do your duty. Go forward.<br> Lively, lads.<br> Thief. Nobody calls me a thief<br> but the men I steals from.<br> Half rations.<br> You there!<br> Who did that?<br> I can't tell you, sir.<br> - Mr. Morrison.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Report that man for two dozen lashes.<br> I done it, sir.<br> Pick it up.<br> Put it back.<br> - Mr. Morrison, lay on with a will.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Bligh, these men aren't<br> king-and-country volunteers.<br> They've been brought aboard<br> by press gangs.<br> In a week, I'll get some spirit<br> without flogging.<br> Teach them who's master<br> and never let them forget.<br> - Mr. Morrison!<br> - Aye.<br> Before we see port, I'll make them<br> jump at a midshipman's jacket...<br> ...even if it's hung<br> on a broomstick to dry.<br> Give this man his two dozen. When I ask<br> for information, I expect to get it.<br> - I didn't hear the watch call, sir.<br> - Why not?<br> Sorry, I was cleaning brass<br> for Mr. Byam.<br> That's true, sir.<br> Stretch this man over a gun<br> and give him two dozen lashes.<br> But I was responsible, sir.<br> Byam will be in charge<br> of the punishment.<br> Two dozen.<br> That's enough, Mr. Morrison.<br> - Man overboard!<br> - Bring a line!<br> Idiot. I'll have to teach<br> my top men not to fall off the ship.<br> Mr. Morrison!<br> When you get him onboard,<br> stretch him with a rail to dry him off.<br> I can't stand it. I got to get water.<br> Get back to your work.<br> I wanted water for my knees, sir.<br> I can't stand it. Please, sir.<br> - What is it?<br> - This man left his work. Wants water.<br> Look, sir, it's the sand<br> worked in cruel.<br> - I wanted water to wash it.<br> - I'll give you water.<br> Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.<br> Haul away!<br> - Well?<br> - The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.<br> Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums,<br> but not one like this in 40 years.<br> - The men in the boats are worn-out.<br> - Not the way they're pulling.<br> - Put new men into the boats.<br> - Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.<br> Change the boat crews.<br> Dive in with your mess, lads.<br> The boats are alongside.<br> Mr. Byam, look at this bit<br> of meat, sir. It's alive.<br> I'm sorry, lad.<br> There's nothing I can do about it.<br> This bit of meat was<br> mined in a rock quarry.<br> - Here, I'll change with you, lad.<br> - Thanks.<br> It's alive, all right...<br> ...but they're fresh meat anyway.<br> Mr. Byam, I'm reporting<br> these two men unfit for duty.<br> - Very good. You men are relieved.<br> - What's the delay here?<br> You realize we're waiting<br> for these men to pull us into a wind?<br> The men haven't finished mess,<br> and these two are unfit for duty.<br> - Unfit?!<br> - My orders, sir.<br> If they can walk, they can work.<br> Put them in the boats and get<br> these other men out immediately.<br> Any sign of a breeze, sir?<br> I'm about at the end of my rope.<br> Keep up your stroke, man.<br> I'll whistle a wind up for you.<br> Can't we...?<br> - Can't we rest a spell, sir?<br> - No, and keep your hatch closed.<br> This is the cask with<br> only one cheese in, sir.<br> - What's this? What's this?<br> - Two cheeses are gone.<br> - What?<br> - Two 50-pound cheeses missing.<br> - Stolen, of course, sir.<br> - Thieves and jailbirds!<br> - What?<br> - A hundred pounds of cheese gone.<br> They'd steal canvas off a corpse.<br> - Strange. I checked the stores myself.<br> - Cheeses can't fly, fool!<br> They've been stolen, of course.<br> Stop allowance of cheese<br> until the theft is made up.<br> Begging your pardon, sir.<br> Back in Portsmouth...<br> ...that cask was opened by you...<br> ...and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses<br> carried ashore.<br> - Silence!<br> - Perhaps you'll recollect, sir.<br> - Maggs had me take them to your house.<br> - You insolent scoundrel!<br> But I remember very well, sir, because<br> I didn't get to see my wife that day.<br> Boatswain, spread-eagle that liar<br> to the rigging till sundown.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Wind off the starboard bow, sir.<br> - Man the lee board braces!<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Here. Get that.<br> Well, Mr. Christian, if your rascals<br> are any good, bring us into the wind.<br> Boats!<br> - Pull, lads! Pull!<br> - Lay into it, now. Get up.<br> Send her up, Burkitt. Pull!<br> Mr. Byam, pull up their strokes!<br> Pull! Pull!<br> - Mr. Hayward, speed up!<br> - Mr. Byam, use your rope's end!<br> - Come on, lads, pull!<br> - Come on, pick them up.<br> Pull!<br> We're almost in!<br> Put your weight in it!<br> Good lad, Muspratt. Pull, lads!<br> We're in!<br> We're in! Well done, there!<br> Shall I call the boats in, sir?<br> They've done their job.<br> What do you expect me to do,<br> knight them? Hoist the boats.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Good, lads! Good, lads!<br> Well, we are out of<br> the doldrums at last, sir.<br> I told you to spread-eagle that liar.<br> Why hasn't it been done?<br> Very good, sir.<br> Come along, McCoy.<br> There's nothing more<br> powerful than brandy.<br> I threw a brandy bottle overboard once,<br> empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.<br> Three years later, I picked it up<br> in a river in Portugal.<br> It had gone back<br> to its home vineyard for more.<br> You would've made<br> an excellent historian.<br> You have a profound contempt for facts.<br> I don't despise facts, sir,<br> I'm indifferent to them.<br> Water. Water.<br> Cheese, Mr. Christian?<br> No, thank you, sir.<br> - Mr. Byam?<br> - No, thank you, sir.<br> - Mr. Fryer?<br> - No, thank you, sir.<br> Perhaps the surgeon<br> wants cheese.<br> No, thank you, sir.<br> It's bad for my innards.<br> To the best of my recollection,<br> Mr. Christian, you're partial to cheese.<br> Not tonight, sir.<br> Burn me. I believe<br> you're with the men.<br> If you'll allow me,<br> I think you've been unjust.<br> - Unjust?<br> - A bit of cheese, more or less.<br> Unjust? In other words,<br> you say I'm the man who lied.<br> - I didn't say that, sir.<br> - You implied it.<br> I've no doubt that Maggs disposed of<br> the cheeses without your knowledge...<br> ...but I can't understand your treatment<br> of the man who obeyed orders.<br> Maggs is my clerk. It's not<br> for my men to question his orders.<br> Nor for you to question mine!<br> I want your apology.<br> I have nothing more to say, sir.<br> Then you can dine elsewhere<br> on what you can get!<br> - Mr. Bligh.<br> - Byam.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Come, he implied it,<br> didn't he, Mr. Byam?<br> Well, I can also dispense<br> with your company!<br> Thank you, sir.<br> So you're all against me,<br> officers and men.<br> Won't eat cheese, eh?<br> Before I'm done with you,<br> I'll make you eat grass!<br> I'm so hungry, if my mother<br> would reach out to pet me...<br> ...I'd have a bit of her hand.<br> There's fish there, all right,<br> but they're making jokes about the bait.<br> You see...<br> If I could prove what I suspect, l...<br> No, I wouldn't.<br> I'm so weak, I'm peaceful.<br> Muspratt, Burkitt,<br> look here, supper.<br> What?<br> Why...<br> Why, Mr. Christian, sir.<br> Take a look at this, sir.<br> Supper for six men.<br> Four pounds, they calls it.<br> If that weighs more than 2,<br> I'll eat the cat-o'-nine-tails.<br> - It ain't pig. It's horse meat.<br> - We pulled our hearts out for this breeze.<br> - And what do we get? We starve.<br> - Well, little meat, no distemper.<br> Keep the wind in the sails<br> and out of your stomach.<br> If it's any comfort,<br> the officers are in the same boat.<br> Not Captain Bligh.<br> He's getting fat, the dirty, thieving...<br> Burkitt!<br> Any more of that,<br> and I'll clap you in irons.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Buckoes. Buckoes.<br> Here's your supper.<br> - Thompson, get your hook and line.<br> - Right.<br> See him? He's a big one, eh?<br> - Here you are, Burkitt.<br> - Right.<br> Well, we've got to have bait.<br> Sharks ain't seamen. They expect to eat.<br> We've got to have bait.<br> - You want to risk this for a meal?<br> - Aye.<br> - I'm willing.<br> - Yeah.<br> If the hook don't kill him, that pork will.<br> Let it go.<br> There he goes. There he goes.<br> - Got him.<br> - On deck with him.<br> - Easy, now. Easy, now. Easy, now.<br> - Hold him.<br> You first, Burkitt. Choose for your mess.<br> - Thanks, mates.<br> - Yeah, fine catch you've got there.<br> You know I must have a slice, eh?<br> - Shark eat shark?<br> - You forget yourself.<br> You give me a slice, a nice, large one,<br> and I'll say nothing.<br> Tell him, you slimy quill-pusher.<br> Take your slice!<br> At ease, lads. At ease.<br> Well, how's our shark-killer, huh?<br> He's cut to bits, sir.<br> He'll be all right.<br> What's a flogging?<br> A few blows and a few "ohs,"<br> and then you put on your shirt.<br> - Here.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Now, if you'd lost a leg, my lad...<br> I left mine with a Spanish pirate<br> off the coast of Trinidad.<br> A bullfighter did the trick for me.<br> He was so drunk he nearly<br> cut off the wrong leg.<br> Hey! Here.<br> You'll be all right.<br> A bit tattooed on the back perhaps,<br> but just the right style for Tahiti, eh?<br> - Hey, fiddler, give him a tune.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Good night, lads.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> Listen, Byam. You can flog<br> those fellows, starve them...<br> ...but they'll bob up again with a fiddle.<br> - Music at sea...<br> ...I never imagined<br> how beautiful it was.<br> Master-at-arms,<br> stop that infernal jamboree.<br> - It's worse than two cats on a fence.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> The old death's-head.<br> I've never known a better seaman,<br> but as a man, he's a snake.<br> He doesn't punish for discipline.<br> He likes to see men crawl.<br> I'd like to push his poison<br> down his own throat.<br> You both have one thing in common,<br> the devil's own temper.<br> He can let his go...<br> ...but whether I can keep mine bottled<br> up for the next two years is a question.<br> I believe you will.<br> Whatever happens, I'll always<br> be glad I've known you.<br> I'll remember that when you're<br> an admiral. Good night, youngster.<br> Good night.<br> - More tea, sir?<br> - No, you get out.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - You sent for me, sir?<br> - Yes, I've got a job for you this morning.<br> - Sit down. Had your breakfast?<br> - Yes, thank you, sir.<br> I want you to sign the list<br> of all supplies issued on the voyage.<br> Certify and sign.<br> We should raise the island anytime now.<br> Not a bad voyage so far.<br> All hands accounted for.<br> Only six down with scurvy.<br> Five with scurvy, one with flogging.<br> Correct, there's your credit.<br> Five with scurvy, one with flogging.<br> We're still under canvas.<br> Mr. Bligh, I can't sign this book.<br> No such amounts have been issued.<br> You've signed daybooks with extra kegs<br> the ship never carried.<br> - I have, sir.<br> - And why not? We all do it.<br> We'd be fools if we didn't<br> on a lieutenant's pay.<br> I want to stow away enough<br> to keep me out of the gutter.<br> I understand, a captain's prerogative.<br> Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind.<br> Why is this case different?<br> The captains I've served<br> with didn't starve their men.<br> They didn't save money by buying up<br> the stinking meat.<br> They didn't buy yams<br> that would sicken a pig.<br> Silence!<br> They didn't call their men thieves<br> and flog them in the bone.<br> - Impudent scoundrel! Sign that book!<br> - I refuse...<br> ...and you have no authority.<br> I haven't?! I'll show you authority.<br> Lay all hands aft! All hands aft!<br> Very good, sir.<br> Company, attend!<br> Mr. Christian, step forward.<br> "If any officer or other person<br> in the fleet...<br> ...shall disobey any lawful command...<br> ...of any of his superior officers,<br> every such person...<br> ...being convicted of such offense<br> shall suffer death...<br> ...or other punishment<br> as shall be inflicted on him...<br> ...by the sentence of a court-martial."<br> Mr. Christian, you will sign this book.<br> Mr. Bligh...<br> ...the ship's company will bear witness<br> that I sign in obedience to your orders.<br> But remember, sir, I shall demand<br> a court of inquiry in England.<br> You mutinous dog.<br> - Retract that, sir.<br> - I will repeat it. You're a mutinous dog.<br> - Mr. Christian.<br> - Land ho, sir!<br> Furl away!<br> There she waits, lads!<br> - What is it, Mr. Fryer?<br> - Tahiti, you fool.<br> So you'll face me<br> with a court of inquiry?<br> We're a long way from England<br> and what can happen on this ship...<br> ...before we get there<br> may surprise even you.<br> Milk! It's milk!<br> Captain, they got cows<br> here that lays eggs. What a place.<br> Would you help me up, sir?<br> I'd like to see the island.<br> What for? All islands are alike.<br> That's a singularly stupid observation,<br> sir, and grossly unscientific.<br> Well, science is one thing<br> and experience is another.<br> - See one island, you've seen them all.<br> - Fiddlesticks.<br> Well, I'm to be first ashore.<br> Captain's orders, to begin my dictionary.<br> I'll get my trade goods.<br> We can go ashore together.<br> All right, then.<br> - I know that man.<br> - Who is he?<br> A friend of Captain Cook's<br> when I was sailing master.<br> Hitihiti, chief of the island,<br> priest of the temple. Pipe him aboard.<br> - Mr. Fryer, dress ship.<br> - Very good, sir. Dress ship!<br> Bligh.<br> - Bligh.<br> - Hitihiti.<br> Oh, yes. Yes.<br> - Bligh, you got fat.<br> - Oh, well, it is 10 years...<br> ...since we sailed together<br> with Captain Cook.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Where Captain Cook?<br> Captain Cook is dead.<br> - Morti?<br> - Yes, yes, morti.<br> - He was a good man.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Hail King George.<br> King George?<br> Captain Cook say King George come<br> on next English ship.<br> His Majesty is extremely<br> sorry he couldn't come.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> My hat.<br> Captain Cook say if King George<br> don't come, he send hat.<br> Yes, yes, yes! Of course, the hat.<br> Mr. Maggs, go to my cabin<br> and bring me the hat...<br> - The cocked hat, you fool!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> The hat will be here<br> in one moment.<br> So we shall require<br> - Breadfruit? Uru.<br> - Correct, uru. Uru.<br> - All we have for you.<br> - Thank you, thank you.<br> We shall have to stay here<br> for several months.<br> We shall have provision...<br> - They're welcome to anything.<br> - Don't be a fool.<br> - You'll need those gifts to make friends.<br> - Him no need gift, my friend.<br> - Me Hitihiti, you my tayo.<br> - Tayo?<br> - Chief makes you his friend.<br> - In my tongue, close friend.<br> You live home, my home.<br> Tayo. Friend, the finest<br> word in any language.<br> - It shall be the first in my dictionary.<br> - The hat.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> With the compliments of His Majesty<br> King George III of Great Britain.<br> - Byam, you come ashore with me.<br> - Sir?<br> Permission granted, mind you report<br> onboard ship every night.<br> - Byam will live with my family.<br> - Impossible.<br> - I can have no favorites aboard my ship.<br> - Bligh, you are chief on this ship...<br> ...but I am chief on that island.<br> Byam will come with me, yes?<br> Perhaps that's best. Permission granted.<br> By the way, Mr. Morrison,<br> pipe the ship's company aft.<br> Aye, aye, sir. All hands aft.<br> Well, we're here. Tahiti at last.<br> England to Cape Horn,<br> Africa, New Zealand...<br> ...Van Diemen's Land<br> and the great South Seas.<br> I've sailed the Bounty<br> over 27,000 miles...<br> ...and you think you've come<br> to an island paradise...<br> ...a tropical grog shop<br> of feast and song and sleep.<br> Well, you're wrong!<br> You're here to labor.<br> You'll fill this ship with breadfruit trees.<br> You'll recondition her for sea.<br> Shore leave permitted<br> if and when I can spare you.<br> If you abuse it, you'll answer to me.<br> Remember, your work is finished when<br> we drop anchor in Portsmouth Harbor.<br> Mr. Fryer will have charge<br> of work ashore.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Mr. Christian, you will remain onboard<br> in charge of reconditioning the ship.<br> Unfortunately, you will have no shore<br> leave while we're here at Tahiti.<br> That's all.<br> What a place.<br> Hey, when's dinner?<br> Your language is most un-English.<br> It means exactly what it says.<br> Here are three pages<br> on your words meaning "look."<br> - Plenty kind of look.<br> - That's the trouble.<br> There's one for the downcast eyes,<br> one for the sidelong glance...<br> ...one that invites, one that consents.<br> A whole language of looks.<br> Byam, you think too much.<br> One day, you head go crack.<br> No, no, no, Tehani. I've told you before.<br> I like my flowers in a bowl.<br> Now, scat. I'm busy.<br> What do you call that look, Byam?<br> The look of a charming girl<br> who will still be happy...<br> ...when we English invaders go home.<br> By the way,<br> what's your word for money?<br> Money? What is money?<br> All right, I'll explain. Which would you<br> choose? The shilling or the nail?<br> Oh, no, Hitihiti. With one of these<br> you can buy 20 of these.<br> - Oh? Where?<br> - Well, in England.<br> You see, in England, you must<br> have money to live with to buy food.<br> In island of England, no fruit on tree?<br> - No fish in the sea?<br> - Oh, yes. Plenty.<br> No money, no food?<br> - That's right.<br> - I stay here.<br> Byam, ahoy!<br> Sounds like Christian.<br> - Well, it can't be.<br> - Maybe so.<br> Hitihiti, you got him leave!<br> Byam!<br> Fletcher!<br> - Ahoy, Robinson Crusoe.<br> - Fletcher!<br> I'd given up on seeing you<br> ashore and Hitihiti never even winked.<br> When he came aboard wearing that hat,<br> even the articles of war failed Mr. Bligh.<br> Christian. Christian. Lieutenant.<br> Thank you<br> for speaking to the captain.<br> The sea is good, but the earth<br> is good also. Be at home.<br> It's good to be ashore again.<br> I've been as restless as...<br> - Well, can you speak Tahitian yet?<br> - Like a native.<br> Why, you little powder monkey!<br> If you cross my hawse again, I'll<br> spank your little starboard, understand?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes?<br> - Well, I didn't know you speak English.<br> - Yes.<br> - You must think me a perfect fool.<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, does she or doesn't she?<br> - Yes. She speak English. One word: Yes.<br> Mr. Byam, your Tahitian dictionary.<br> Madam.<br> This is Hitihiti's granddaughter.<br> - What did she say?<br> - You must be a king in your country.<br> What?<br> If His Majesty could see her...<br> ...as I see her now,<br> he'd forgive the error.<br> - Shall I tell her that?<br> - No, no. Just say thank you.<br> Byam...<br> ...your friend is wise.<br> He looks, he understand.<br> You make word,<br> you understand nothing.<br> No work today. Go swim, all.<br> Come along, Fletcher. I'll show you<br> an island you'll never forget.<br> - You can't imagine what it's...<br> - Byam.<br> They'd like to come with us,<br> if you don't object.<br> - Object?<br> - I thought not.<br> Christian?<br> Aren't they amazing? I never knew<br> there were such people in the world.<br> They're simple and kind,<br> and yet, somehow, they're royal.<br> What did you say?<br> Nothing.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was just thinking...<br> ...what a contrast to the ship.<br> Tehani wants to race me. Come on!<br> - Oh.<br> - What's wrong?<br> He comes from the ship.<br> - Captain Bligh's orders.<br> - Bligh?<br> You're to report onboard immediately.<br> Oh, I am? Byam, I know his game!<br> He gives me leave and recalls it to devil<br> me into insubordination. I'll oblige him!<br> I'll have one day off that ship<br> if I swing for it! Tell him I refuse!<br> What did she say?<br> The man will tell Captain Bligh<br> you can't be found.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> I'm sorry I lost my temper.<br> She says you were magnificent,<br> like a storm at sea.<br> - Thanks for your kindness.<br> - You will come again?<br> - That rests with you and the captain.<br> - You will come again.<br> Byam, it's been a day.<br> Goodbye, Maimiti.<br> - Goodbye, all.<br> - Goodbye, Fletcher.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Stewart.<br> Mr. Bligh wishes you to report to him<br> as soon as you come aboard, sir.<br> Thank you, Mr. Stewart.<br> - Reporting, sir.<br> - You relieve my anxiety.<br> I was about to send an armed<br> shore party to look for you.<br> - I had your permission, sir.<br> - You're a fine figure of a king's officer.<br> If I could prove to that native you're a<br> liar, they'd arrest you! You'll regret this!<br> Before this voyage is over,<br> you'll know who's master here!<br> Mr. Bligh, I have in mind the dead<br> seaman you had flogged in Portsmouth.<br> He struck his captain.<br> You'd like me to strike you.<br> - Well, I won't do it.<br> - Very clever, Mr. Christian.<br> Mr. Morgan, I shall commend<br> your industry to Sir Joseph Banks.<br> Thank you. There's one difficulty, sir,<br> a very grave one.<br> These growing plants require more water<br> than we can store aboard.<br> We can't let them die, sir.<br> We won't.<br> Mr. Morgan, I'll take these trees<br> to the West Indies...<br> ...every tree in prime condition.<br> I shall cut the water allowance<br> for the entire ship's company.<br> Good morrow to you.<br> I'll drink your health in Portsmouth!<br> - Put your stuff there.<br> - It's mine, sir. It's a gift.<br> Captain's orders.<br> Put it down and go forward!<br> Shore leave in heaven, duty in hell again.<br> - What have you got there?<br> - Monday Wash, sir.<br> It's a pet, sir.<br> Her name's Monday Wash.<br> Mr. Maggs, take that laundry<br> for the captain's table.<br> But, sir!<br> Now get forward!<br> - Come along, there. Hurry!<br> - Did he hurt you?<br> No, but one day,<br> I'll take that cane away...<br> Look behind you.<br> Yes.<br> Aren't you coming aboard, Hitihiti?<br> I have said farewell to Bligh.<br> I have sent gift to King George.<br> - Then this is goodbye.<br> - Yes.<br> Byam, tayo.<br> - You have been happy here?<br> - Very happy, Hitihiti.<br> Byam, I have no son.<br> Stay here with me. Be my son.<br> I must return to England.<br> I shall never come back.<br> Byam...<br> ...you will think of us sometime.<br> - Hitihiti.<br> Roger! Will you come here, please?<br> - Look.<br> - Big as gooseberries!<br> Please make her understand.<br> These are priceless, I can't take them.<br> She says they're for your mother.<br> Oh. Well, thank her, Roger.<br> And tell her when this voyage is over,<br> somehow, I'm coming back.<br> - I can't tell her that.<br> - I mean it, Roger.<br> But it's a dream, Fletcher.<br> This island isn't real for you and me.<br> It's the ship that's real.<br> It's taking us home.<br> Tell her, Roger.<br> Thank you, Roger.<br> Goodbye, Maimiti.<br> That's right. No tears, lass.<br> Love?<br> Love.<br> Goodbye.<br> Reporting with deserters. Taken on the<br> other side of the island. No resistance.<br> Very well, Mr. Young.<br> So you let them take you alive.<br> You'll regret that, me lads.<br> Take them below.<br> We ain't deserters, sir.<br> You kept us aboard because we<br> dropped that tub of breadfruit.<br> - We wanted to see the island...<br> - Take them below and put them in irons.<br> Prisoners in escort, into file.<br> Left, turn!<br> Quick march!<br> - Is she ready for sea, Mr. Fryer?<br> - Ready, sir.<br> - Set topsails and jibs.<br> - Stand by. Topsails and jibs.<br> All hands on deck!<br> Looking about me, I can't believe<br> we're in a ship of the royal navy.<br> The deck's like a barnyard!<br> Paradise is astern, gentlemen.<br> I'll break the men of that island<br> if I have to flog every thieving...<br> Which reminds me...<br> ...10 coconuts, Crown property,<br> were stolen on your watch.<br> Correct, Mr. Maggs?<br> - I counted myself.<br> - I'll account for the men in my watch.<br> - They didn't take them.<br> - Can you account for yourself?<br> Mr. Bligh, may I recall<br> the outward voyage?<br> Harsh things were said, but I hoped<br> the return trip would be better.<br> Then suppose you<br> return the 10 coconuts.<br> - You think I'm so fond of them I'd steal?<br> - Yes, you hypocrite.<br> You stole Crown property<br> more valuable.<br> - Explain that!<br> - Pearls, Mr. Christian.<br> - Pearls?<br> - I believe I said pearls.<br> Fortunately, Mr. Maggs was at the boat.<br> He saw that native woman<br> give you two pearls.<br> I think I'm beginning to understand.<br> The native woman, as you call her,<br> gave the pearls to me.<br> - They are not Crown property.<br> - The goods I gave away to the natives...<br> ...belong to the Crown. What comes<br> back belongs to the Crown!<br> I'm not the most patient man<br> in the world. Give them to me!<br> Remember, Mr. Bligh:<br> Crown property.<br> Very well, Mr. Christian.<br> Crown property.<br> - Gratings rigged.<br> - Everybody present?<br> - Everyone present, sir, but the surgeon.<br> - The surgeon is ill, sir.<br> - Ill? Drunk, you mean!<br> - We had to bleed him this morning, sir.<br> He's not fit.<br> Mr. Morgan and Mr. Christian agree.<br> Go below. Tell him to report<br> on deck at once!<br> Very good, sir.<br> Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Thompson,<br> step forward.<br> Ship's company, off hats.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> Captain Bligh...<br> How do you feel?<br> I'm afraid I'm a very old man, lad...<br> ...and a very sick one.<br> - I'll tell him again you can't report.<br> No, boy. No, I'm not worth<br> getting into a scrape over.<br> For once, a midshipman gives an order.<br> You stay where you are.<br> A good lad.<br> A good lad.<br> I must pull him out.<br> I've taken the liberty of telling the<br> surgeon to stay. He's not able to report.<br> I'll have no drunken relic holding up<br> the discipline aboard my ship.<br> Once more, bring him on deck,<br> or I'll have you seized up and flogged.<br> Byam doesn't wanna disobey you. I beg<br> you, don't force the old man.<br> He can't walk.<br> - Go below and see for yourself.<br> - Are you presuming to give me orders?<br> Reporting on deck for duty, sir.<br> Mr. Morrison, do your duty.<br> Four dozen, I believe.<br> Four dozen it is, sir.<br> Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.<br> - Well?<br> - What did you expect, Mr. Bligh?<br> The man's dead.<br> I call this ship's company<br> to bear witness.<br> - You killed him!<br> - Silence.<br> Ship's company dismissed.<br> Boatswain, punishment postponed<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Do you hear, men?<br> Ship's company dismissed!<br> Bear a hand. Take him below.<br> Drunkard?<br> Yes, but everybody loved him.<br> The welfare of men on shipboard...<br> ...depends upon things that seem small.<br> A joke at the right moment.<br> A glass of grog.<br> A kind word would do more with seamen<br> than the cat-o'-nine-tails.<br> And this ship will be the worse...<br> ...if possible, for his death.<br> Wonder if that's Defoe Island.<br> The natives are cannibals...<br> ...but it's land.<br> The last we'll see for months.<br> You'd better get some rest.<br> You've been here for hours.<br> No. I can't sleep,<br> and it's nearly my watch.<br> - Well, good night.<br> - Roger.<br> - There's something I want you to do.<br> - Gladly. What is it?<br> One never knows what may happen<br> on a voyage like this.<br> If for any reason I don't return to<br> England, I want you to see my parents.<br> Well, why shouldn't<br> you return to England?<br> Why?<br> I can't stand this devil's work<br> much longer.<br> One day I'll forget<br> this discipline and break his neck.<br> Wait until we're back in England.<br> The admiralty will save you the trouble.<br> Well, in any case,<br> I'd like you to see my parents.<br> - Of course. Where do they live?<br> - In Cumberland at Maincordare.<br> I've almost forgotten<br> what the old place looks like.<br> I haven't seen it in 10 years.<br> But I do remember<br> a tapestry in the hall...<br> ...with ships and islands on it.<br> Perhaps that's what<br> sent me off to sea.<br> I don't know.<br> In any case,<br> I'd like you to see my home.<br> If anything should happen, tell my<br> father and mother you knew me.<br> - You can count on me.<br> - Good. That's settled, then.<br> - Mr. Byam, you're up late.<br> - It's fairly warm below.<br> I hadn't noticed. A true sailor can sleep<br> in an oven or on ice. Get below.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Your watch, Mr. Christian.<br> And I must count the coconuts.<br> Mr. Christian, sir.<br> That shark's been following us since<br> the surgeon died, waiting for the burial.<br> - Couldn't I have a musket to shoot it?<br> - Take the deck.<br> - I'll get the keys to the arms chest.<br> - Two muskets.<br> I'd like to shoot that shark onboard.<br> It's no use. Now's our chance.<br> There's a lot of us here ready. And the<br> officers and men that won't join us...<br> - Well, it's them or us!<br> - Keep your hatch closed!<br> Now, get forward!<br> Who's there?<br> Sailor hand, mate.<br> - Hey, what's this noise about here?<br> - Water, mate.<br> Water?<br> - For deserters?<br> - But the lad slipped his cable.<br> Well, here's to you slipping yours.<br> When I'm free, I'll wring your scrawny<br> pipe stem till your tongue pops out!<br> Tongue, is it? I'll give you something<br> to remind you of that slice of shark.<br> You scum! Get out!<br> I'm sorry, lad.<br> Are you all right?<br> Thank you, Mr. Christian, sir.<br> Better take care of Thompson, sir.<br> Murdering butcher!<br> I've had enough of this blood ship!<br> He's not master of life and death on a<br> quarterdeck above the angels. McCoy!<br> Quintal!<br> I'm sick of blood! Bloody backs!<br> Bloody faces!<br> Bligh, you've given your last command!<br> We'll be men again if we hang for it!<br> You say you're ready for anything?<br> Release them!<br> - You're taking the ship?<br> - Mutiny?<br> Yes, mutiny! Pass the word.<br> Seize the arms chest.<br> We've been waiting for this!<br> No! Don't hit me!<br> Take him!<br> Boatswain!<br> No, no, don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!<br> Now, wake up! Get into your clothes<br> and lose no time about it.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - What's happened?<br> - Have we been attacked?<br> - No, we've taken the ship.<br> And old Bligh's a prisoner.<br> Mutiny?<br> Tie him to the pipe.<br> Mr. Morrison! Mr. Coleman!<br> Shut up or I'll shut your trap for you!<br> Give up this madness,<br> or we'll all be murdered.<br> You're in no danger.<br> What will we do with him?<br> - Shoot him!<br> - I'll slit his dirty throat!<br> See that, you butcher? My four dozen.<br> We'll give you 400.<br> - We'll let you know what it feels like!<br> - Flog him!<br> You old rogue. You'd flog us.<br> You'd make us eat grass.<br> You bluenosed baboon!<br> Back! Back, all of you!<br> No more flogging aboard this ship.<br> That's why we're taking it.<br> We'll have something to say about that!<br> What will you do with him?<br> Put him in a launch and cast him adrift.<br> Give him food, water,<br> cutlasses and a compass.<br> You can have your choice.<br> Go with him or stay with me.<br> No. Slit his throat, I say,<br> and feed him to the sharks.<br> And I say go forward!<br> Clear the launch and lower away!<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Stand by, Thompson.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Lively, old buzzing bees.<br> What a pity, what a pity!<br> Every little tree, perfect.<br> - You'll be sure to water them?<br> - Never you fret. We'll water them.<br> We'll take care of your plants,<br> here, Morgan!<br> You may stay onboard if you like,<br> without joining us.<br> No, thank you, sir.<br> All right. Your turn, Mr. Bligh.<br> Mr. Christian, I give you your last chance<br> to return to duty.<br> I'll take my chance against the law.<br> You'll take yours against the sea.<br> But you're taking my ship! My ship!<br> Your ship? The king's ship, you mean,<br> and you're not fit to command it.<br> Into the boat!<br> We're ready, Churchill.<br> Bear a hand here, will you?<br> McCoy! McCoy!<br> Two little monkey jackets.<br> Loyal to Captain Bligh, eh?<br> - Serves them right.<br> - Come on, lads, on deck.<br> I tell you, we will!<br> Mr. Christian, you forgot us.<br> Call back the boat.<br> There's no more room.<br> You must stay with us.<br> - We'll join our captain!<br> - We're not mutineers!<br> I said there was no more room!<br> Take them below!<br> Stand the guns on them!<br> Give them a drink!<br> Casting me adrift 3500 miles<br> from a port of call.<br> You're sending me to my doom, eh?<br> Well, you're wrong, Christian!<br> I'll take this boat as she floats<br> to England if I must!<br> I'll live to see you,<br> all of you...<br> ...hanging from the highest yardarm<br> in the British fleet!<br> Yardarms, is it? I'll give you yardarms.<br> Burkitt!<br> You're not leaving them adrift?<br> They'll starve or drown.<br> - That's Bligh's affair.<br> - Your friends, Morgan, Purcell...<br> Do you think I wanted this?<br> - Call back the boat.<br> - No.<br> - Call it back!<br> - No!<br> These men have been in hell.<br> I couldn't stand it.<br> - Then I must go with Bligh.<br> - There's no room.<br> Then I call on you men.<br> All of you, in the name<br> of the king, return to duty.<br> Cock-a-doodle-doo!<br> Give me that gun! Give me that!<br> Take him below.<br> Stand by to wear ship.<br> - What course, sir?<br> - West-northwest, Tahiti.<br> Tahiti, lads!<br> Tahiti! Tahiti!<br> Hey, Thompson!<br> Here comes their water!<br> Sit down, Roger.<br> You know, there are five other men<br> onboard...<br> ...who refused to take part<br> in the mutiny.<br> They've agreed not to try<br> and retake the ship.<br> You may have your liberty<br> under the same conditions.<br> I simply want your word for it.<br> You may have it.<br> But I'll escape if I can.<br> I understand.<br> Then I may go?<br> Yes, you may go.<br> Roger...<br> ...I'm sorry I had to hit you.<br> That didn't hurt.<br> What hurts is that you and I<br> can never again be friends.<br> Keep her as she goes, west-northwest.<br> West-northwest, sir.<br> I presume you'll make<br> for the nearest island.<br> No. That's certain death. The savages<br> in these parts are fierce cannibals.<br> We must keep well clear of those fellas.<br> By my reckoning, the first port from<br> which we can expect help is Timor...<br> ...in the Dutch East Indies,<br> some 3500 miles away.<br> Then our case is hopeless.<br> It is by no means hopeless.<br> We have extra canvas, rope, a tool<br> chest. We'll put on every rag of sail.<br> That's impossible. Deeply laden as we<br> are, we'd fill with the first storm.<br> Then we'll bail with our hands<br> if we must.<br> She'll see us through if we do our part,<br> she will!<br> Begging your pardon, sir,<br> but the food and the water.<br> We haven't got enough for 10 days.<br> If we are to reach Timor alive,<br> we must make it last 20, 40, 50 days.<br> It's the sea against us.<br> Mr. Bligh, we'd be pleased if you'd<br> ask God's blessing on our journey.<br> That I shall do, Mr. Fryer.<br> Almighty God, thou knowest our need.<br> Grant we acquit ourselves like men...<br> ...in the trials and dangers<br> that lie before us.<br> Bail!<br> Bail!<br> Bail faster!<br> Bail faster! Bail!<br> Another piece, Mr. Maggs.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, lad.<br> Are we all served?<br> All served, sir.<br> Now, lads, for your own good,<br> eat and drink slowly.<br> How far have we still to go, sir?<br> Don't let your mind<br> dwell upon that, lad.<br> Think how far we've come.<br> We'll never see Portsmouth again?<br> We'll see Portsmouth again...<br> ...and we'll see Fletcher Christian<br> hanging from a yardarm...<br> ...and every pirate with him.<br> Steady, mates.<br> Steady.<br> Mr. Fryer, take the tiller.<br> Get away! I caught him!<br> Hey, lads! Give me that bird!<br> Share and share alike, lads.<br> The blood for the sick.<br> Raise him up, Mr. Maggs.<br> Norton, get me a cup.<br> This will nourish you, Mr. Morgan.<br> No, thank you, sir.<br> Give it to the youngsters.<br> They need it more.<br> Yes, Mr. Morgan,<br> but I'm still giving the orders.<br> Timor, up ahead.<br> Timor!<br> Up with you. Up with you.<br> We've beaten the sea itself.<br> I hope Master Roger has<br> a nice Christmas, ma'am.<br> Thank you.<br> - Well, good night, ma'am.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, ma'am.<br> - Good night, ma'am.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Will there be anything more?<br> - Nothing more, Burrows.<br> - Thank you.<br> Christmas?<br> Yes, Christmas.<br> Peace on earth, goodwill to...<br> Come along.<br> A merry Christmas to you,<br> Mrs. Christian.<br> Thank you, lads.<br> A merry Christmas to you all.<br> - Same to you, sir.<br> - Merry Christmas, Mr. Christian.<br> Won't you come...?<br> - Roger!<br> - Merry Christmas, Fletcher.<br> Oh, thanks, lad. I've been hoping<br> for this for a year.<br> Come in. This is a day worth celebrating.<br> Begging your pardon, sir.<br> We've brought the little lady<br> a bit of Christmas.<br> Well, thanks, lad.<br> But she must have it from you.<br> Come in. Come in, lads, all of you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Aye, aye.<br> My boy was like that<br> when I left home, sir.<br> He'll be 3 years old now.<br> Come on, lads.<br> Everybody outside for some grog.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Isn't that a sweet baby?<br> Help yourself, lads!<br> Thank you, sir.<br> The surgeon's, Roger.<br> It would delight his soul to have us<br> drink it, especially on this day.<br> Friend. Good, good.<br> Hitihiti, here.<br> Makes head go round, round.<br> Come on, Byrne, drink some of this!<br> Where's Ellison? Ellison!<br> Come on!<br> What? A ship?<br> - Maybe she's Spanish.<br> - No.<br> - No, she's British-rigged.<br> - British?<br> Did you hear that, mate? British.<br> - British?<br> - She's coming for us.<br> We've got a chance.<br> The wind's against her.<br> She must lay outside the reef<br> till morning.<br> Get your families and your goods<br> together! Get aboard the Bounty!<br> Thompson, everyone onboard?<br> Burkitt and Muspratt<br> have gone into hiding.<br> The fools! They'll be taken and hanged.<br> Get in the boat.<br> Where are you taking us?<br> I don't know. The Pacific is filled<br> with uncharted islands.<br> We'll find one and settle there for good.<br> Mr. Christian, I've got a wife and child<br> in England. I've got to get back.<br> Back? You know what that means?<br> A yardarm.<br> I must take that chance, sir.<br> But whatever happens,<br> I'll never blame you.<br> Thanks, lad, and I understand.<br> Good luck.<br> Well, this is goodbye, youngster.<br> We'll never see each other again,<br> that's certain.<br> - But I'll remember.<br> - I will too, Fletcher.<br> When you're back in England<br> with the fleet...<br> ...you'll hear the hue and cry against me.<br> From now on, they'll spell mutiny<br> with my name.<br> I regret that...<br> ...but not the taking of the ship.<br> Every time I think of Bligh...<br> Well, I'd do it again.<br> If ever I reach England again, I'll go<br> to your father and tell him the truth.<br> Thanks.<br> - I'll be happier knowing that.<br> - Fletcher.<br> What is out there for you?<br> Another island.<br> - Stand by. I'll be back in a moment.<br> - Hurry up, Byam.<br> When she comes around the headland,<br> we're going to pilot her in.<br> Oh, Tehani, I'll be back in two hours.<br> Tehani knows.<br> The ship may be here for months<br> before she sails.<br> But she will sail.<br> Byam, midshipman. Tehani knows.<br> Tehani, you're my wife, always.<br> Mrs. Roger Byam.<br> My wife, my darling.<br> There she is, lads,<br> and we've nothing to fear.<br> We took no part in the mutiny.<br> Soon we'll be in England.<br> Thank God! Thank God!<br> We're returning. Good, eh?<br> Very good, sir. My name's Byam,<br> Roger Byam. This is Mr. Stewart.<br> We're midshipmen<br> of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.<br> Bring those men up!<br> Captain Bligh, thank God<br> you're alive, sir.<br> They gave me a boat and a sail,<br> didn't they?<br> Where is Fletcher Christian?<br> He sailed yesterday, sir,<br> when your ship was sighted.<br> - Where to?<br> - I don't know, sir.<br> - You don't know, Stewart?<br> - I don't know either.<br> You're lying, both of you.<br> Sergeant, put these men in irons.<br> - Irons? What for?<br> - Mutiny.<br> But we're not mutineers.<br> A court-martial in England<br> will decide that.<br> - We're as loyal as you.<br> - A court-martial will decide that!<br> We're reporting for duty!<br> If we're guilty, we'd go with Christian.<br> When Christian took my ship,<br> you remained with him...<br> ...and you'll have to answer for it.<br> It'll be better to tell me where he's gone!<br> - We don't know, sir.<br> - Then you'll lie in the hold...<br> ...until you do know.<br> Sergeant, take them below!<br> By the mark, 12! Rocky bottom!<br> - To the lee helm.<br> - Lee helm, sir.<br> - Steady!<br> - Steady, sir.<br> Mark 12!<br> - Foretop, any sail in sight?<br> - No sail, sir.<br> - Banktop!<br> - No sail, sir.<br> By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!<br> Mr. Byam, I can't understand why<br> he keeps us below here in irons.<br> You and Mr. Stewart, Mclntosh,<br> Coleman, Byrne and myself...<br> ...we are no mutineers.<br> Haven't I told him that<br> time and time again?<br> His marines surprised me and Muspratt,<br> sir, or we wouldn't be here, alive.<br> Reefs ahead!<br> Attention below.<br> Have you decided to tell me<br> where Christian sailed for?<br> By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!<br> Well, I'm waiting!<br> Well, stay here and rot.<br> My watch, I believe, Mr. Christian.<br> Very well, Mr. Young.<br> - You heathen slime!<br> - Enough!<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> Mr. Christian, sir, when are you<br> going to make a landfall?<br> We're fierce sick of this.<br> It's more than man can stand...<br> ...to be at sea forever in a ghost ship.<br> I've steered off the track of ships. When<br> it's safe, I'll put about for the island.<br> Until then you've got to trust me,<br> that's all.<br> Deep 11. Rocky bottom!<br> I beg you again to give up the search.<br> The Bounty must be lost. The ship's<br> dragging barnacles. The seams are open.<br> Men are working the pumps<br> day and night.<br> - We're still afloat, are we not?<br> - Only by the grace of God in these reefs.<br> - Ease her off a point.<br> - Ease her off a point, sir.<br> I must remind you this is<br> one of His Majesty's ships.<br> Mr. Edwards, I intend to bring back<br> Fletcher Christian.<br> Unless he's hanging from a yardarm,<br> not one of His Majesty's ships is safe.<br> Mutiny and piracy will be rampant<br> in the fleet.<br> - But we'll lose the ship.<br> - Then we'll lose it!<br> As long as I have a deck under me,<br> I'll search for that man.<br> Fourteen!<br> To starboard!<br> Old Bligh's a seaman.<br> The rocks are so thick, a fish<br> couldn't swim between them...<br> ...without rubbing off his scales.<br> - By the mark, 8!<br> Eight fathom! Let's hope<br> we're moored before night...<br> ...or the sharks will have us.<br> By the mark, 2!<br> Breakers ahead.<br> Hard alee!<br> What's happened?<br> - Hard to port!<br> - Very good, sir!<br> Haul out both of them!<br> Get the doors!<br> Captain Bligh!<br> Captain Bligh!<br> Get us out! We'll drown!<br> Lift with them and turn around!<br> Captain Bligh! Let us out of here!<br> Save your voice, man!<br> Take charge of the aft boat.<br> Captain Bligh, get us out of here!<br> - Get those men out!<br> - Aye, aye, sir! Come on, men!<br> Hurry up, soldier!<br> - The first boat's ready.<br> - Take them out.<br> Make for the Australian coast.<br> Prisoners go with me in the other boat.<br> - Very good, sir. God be with you.<br> - God be with you.<br> Hurry up with you down there.<br> Thank you. You saved our lives.<br> Mr. Byam, I wouldn't lose you<br> for a flagship. Get into the boat!<br> How long has this trial been going on?<br> About a week now.<br> They should reach a verdict soon.<br> Oh, there, there, child.<br> But they won't let me see him.<br> Why won't they let me see him?<br> If I could see him to talk to him,<br> he'd know I trust him.<br> - He knows that, darling.<br> - Oh, but it's cruel. Cruel.<br> They can't hang him!<br> There's the signal.<br> The trial is opened again.<br> On the 15th day of September, 1792...<br> ...for mutiny on His Majesty's ship,<br> Bounty.<br> Call Mr. Fryer.<br> Mr. Fryer.<br> Do you swear by God<br> any evidence you give...?<br> Besides the leader, did you see any<br> of the prisoners now before this court...<br> ...in arms?<br> - Yes, milord.<br> - Inform the court.<br> Seaman Burkitt and Seaman Muspratt<br> were armed with muskets.<br> Seaman Ellison was armed<br> with a bayonet.<br> Have any of the accused any questions<br> to put to this witness?<br> Yes, milord.<br> Good morning, Mr. Fryer.<br> Oh, good morning, lad.<br> Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed<br> with a bayonet.<br> - Did you see me use it?<br> - By no means, lad.<br> Address your replies to the court.<br> Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.<br> He merely flourished it<br> under Captain Bligh's nose...<br> ...and called him a few names.<br> Names? What names did he call him?<br> Sir, he...<br> He called him a bluenosed baboon.<br> Have you any more questions<br> to ask the witness?<br> No, milord.<br> That is all.<br> Milord, I should like to ask<br> a few questions of Captain Bligh.<br> Very well, Captain Nelson.<br> - Call Captain Bligh.<br> - Captain Bligh.<br> Captain Bligh, in the previous evidence<br> given before this court...<br> ...you failed to make clear<br> one very important point:<br> A motive for the mutiny.<br> Can you tell us why your men<br> took your ship?<br> No, sir. Until I was seized<br> in the cabin, I suspected nothing.<br> A circumstance occurred<br> the night before...<br> ...which should have aroused<br> my suspicions.<br> Going on deck, I found Fletcher Christian<br> and Roger Byam...<br> ...talking together at the rail.<br> I heard Roger Byam say,<br> "You can count on me."<br> I heard Christian reply,<br> "Good. That's settled."<br> I saw them shake hands.<br> I realized afterwards they<br> were plotting to seize the Bounty.<br> But that's not true, Captain Bligh.<br> Milord, gentlemen, let me explain.<br> If the prisoner so desires,<br> he may question the witness.<br> Captain Bligh, you've not repeated<br> my whole talk with Fletcher Christian.<br> Did you not hear him tell me<br> about his home in Cumberland?<br> I did not.<br> Well, did you not<br> hear him ask my promise...<br> ...that if he did not return, I would<br> tell his parents what had happened?<br> I did not.<br> I swear before God<br> and before this court...<br> ...that was the content<br> of my talk with Christian.<br> It had nothing to do with mutiny.<br> Captain Bligh, apart from<br> the conversation you overheard...<br> ...was Mr. Byam's previous conduct<br> such that you believe him guilty?<br> Sir, his entire conduct convinces me<br> that he plotted with Christian.<br> They were friends before the mutiny.<br> They remained friends after the mutiny.<br> When I arrived, the prisoner<br> could've arrested Christian.<br> But he allowed him to escape.<br> On his own admittance.<br> Yes, but you knew I was trapped<br> on the island, perhaps for years.<br> Outnumbered, unarmed.<br> I gave my word to Christian<br> not to move against him.<br> Mr. Byam, if you were loyal<br> when Christian escaped...<br> ...I should have found you dead.<br> I have nothing more to ask him.<br> I can only say again to this court,<br> I am not guilty of mutiny.<br> If that is so, why did you not join<br> your captain when he was cast adrift?<br> I was below planning a counterattack<br> to regain the ship from the mutineers.<br> With whom did you plan the attack?<br> Sir, with my messmate,<br> Midshipman Stewart.<br> Milord...<br> ...Midshipman Stewart died<br> in the Pandora 's boat.<br> "The Lord is my shepherd.<br> I shall not want."<br> The Lord is my shepherd.<br> I shall not want.<br> Can't they ever reach a verdict?<br> I'm that sick of waiting, I could stamp<br> on a litter of wildcats...<br> ...and never feel a scratch.<br> Well, what are you looking at?<br> It ain't Tahiti. It's only Portsmouth.<br> I thought she might row by in a boat.<br> Who, the queen?<br> No, my wife.<br> Sorry, lad.<br> Why can't I see her?<br> My wife, my boy...<br> ...that's all I've come back for.<br> I knew they'd hang me.<br> But I've got to see them.<br> I've got to see them!<br> Blast these sea captains!<br> Who made their sea law?<br> God didn't. The burning killers!<br> Lad! We're all in the same boat, Tom.<br> They won't let me see my mother.<br> Won't you help us now<br> by holding on?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Roger Byam?<br> Follow me, please.<br> - Sir Joseph.<br> - My lad, they've reached a verdict.<br> - Watch the dirk.<br> - The dirk?<br> The midshipman's dirk will be lying<br> on the table before Lord Hood.<br> If it lies crosswise,<br> you've been acquitted.<br> If the point lies toward you,<br> you've been condemned.<br> God be with you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Prisoner and escort, halt.<br> Left, hut.<br> Have you anything to say<br> before the sentence of this court...<br> ...is passed upon you?<br> Milord, much as I desire to live,<br> I'm not afraid to die.<br> Since I first sailed on the Bounty<br> four years ago...<br> ...I've known how men can be made<br> to suffer worse things than death.<br> Cruelly, beyond duty, beyond necessity.<br> Captain Bligh, you've told your story<br> of mutiny on the Bounty.<br> How men plotted against you,<br> seized your ship...<br> ...cast you adrift in an open boat.<br> A great venture in science brought<br> to nothing. Two British ships lost.<br> But there's another story,<br> Captain Bligh...<br> ...of 10 coconuts and two cheeses.<br> A story of a man who robbed his<br> seamen, cursed them, flogged them.<br> Not to punish, but to break their spirit.<br> A story of greed and tyranny...<br> ...and of anger against it,<br> of what it cost.<br> One man, milord,<br> would not endure such tyranny.<br> That's why you hounded him. That's<br> why you hate him, hate his friends.<br> And that's why you're beaten.<br> Fletcher Christian's still free.<br> But Christian lost too, milord.<br> God knows he's judged himself<br> more harshly than you could judge him.<br> I say to his father, he was my friend.<br> No finer man ever lived.<br> I don't try to justify his crime,<br> his mutiny...<br> ...but I condemn the tyranny<br> that drove him to it.<br> I don't speak here for myself alone,<br> but for these men you've condemned.<br> I speak in their names and Fletcher<br> Christian's name for all men at sea.<br> These men don't ask for comfort.<br> They don't ask for safety.<br> If they could speak to you, they'd say:<br> "Let us choose to do our duty willingly.<br> Not the choice of a slave,<br> but that of free Englishmen."<br> They ask only the freedom<br> that England expects for every man.<br> If one man among you believed that...<br> One man.<br> He could command the fleets of England.<br> He could sweep the seas for England.<br> If he called his men to their duty<br> not by flaying their backs...<br> ...but by lifting their hearts...<br> ...their...<br> That's all.<br> Roger Byam, midshipman.<br> Having heard the evidence against you<br> and having heard your own defense...<br> ...the sentence of this court is<br> you shall suffer death by hanging...<br> ...onboard such of His Majesty's ships<br> of war and at such time...<br> ...as the commissioners for executing<br> the office of lord high admiral...<br> ...of Great Britain and Ireland<br> shall direct.<br> Prisoner and escort, into file.<br> Left, turn. Quick, hut.<br> I pronounce this court dissolved.<br> Milord, may I congratulate the court?<br> Captain Bligh, in my opinion,<br> your open-boat voyage...<br> ...was the most remarkable conduct<br> of navigation in the history of the sea.<br> I must admire your seamanship<br> and courage, but...<br> Detachment, fall in.<br> Thanks, mate.<br> I've seen them, sir,<br> thanks to you and your friends.<br> The wife, she's well, sir.<br> And the boy, blow me,<br> I hardly knew him, he's growed so.<br> You wouldn't believe it,<br> the dead spit of me.<br> I'm glad, Tom.<br> Look, sir. Like the one she gave me<br> the day we sailed for Tahiti.<br> Do you know, sir,<br> that sailing seems like a dream.<br> As far away as the islands are.<br> I remember how Mr. Christian<br> talked to me that day.<br> Cheered me up, he did.<br> Where do you think he is now, sir?<br> I'd give anything to know.<br> One thing's certain,<br> he's taken that ship beyond maps.<br> I wonder if he found his island.<br> - Well, sir, what did you find?<br> - Your new home, lads.<br> There she is, Pitcairn's Island.<br> - There's no anchorage, no place to land.<br> - That's why I chose it.<br> I plan to run the Bounty in head-on,<br> salvage what we can, then burn her.<br> - We'd be fools to burn her.<br> - We'll be fools if we don't.<br> If there's one spar left in sight,<br> we'll never be safe.<br> - We can't burn the ship.<br> - We can never get back.<br> There's no way back, lad.<br> Once ashore, we're there to stay.<br> But this ship's our last tie with home.<br> Yon's a lonely rock to die on.<br> It's enough to live on.<br> There's sun and earth and water.<br> It can be a hell or a home<br> as we choose to make it.<br> We'll remember this as long<br> as we live and regret it.<br> And remember why we took this ship.<br> They can't press-gang you there, they<br> can't starve you, and can't flog you.<br> We're not afraid of a new life.<br> As long as we can live it with decency<br> and self-respect, we can and we must.<br> For ourselves and our children.<br> Well, hands for burning?<br> - I say burn her, hull and sticks.<br> - Aye, aye.<br> Very well. We'll get the women<br> and children ashore...<br> ...and then stand by to take her in.<br> She makes a grand light, sir.<br> Good English oak.<br> Discipline has been maintained.<br> The mutineers who confessed<br> have been punished.<br> But we're here to plead<br> for the life of Roger Byam...<br> ...because we believe him innocent.<br> And there is more at stake here,<br> Your Majesty, than his life.<br> We do not exaggerate<br> when we say a new understanding...<br> ...between officers and men<br> has come to the fleet.<br> By returning Byam to duty, Your Majesty<br> will confirm that understanding.<br> And not for today only,<br> but for all time to come.<br> Everyone aboard?<br> - The last shore boat's coming alongside.<br> - Make ready for sea.<br> Very good, sir.<br> - Ship ready for sea, sir.<br> - Very good.<br> - Midshipman Byam, reporting for duty.<br> - You take the mizzenmast, Byam.<br> - Very glad to have you with us, lad.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - May I, Byam?<br> - Of course.<br> We're off to the Mediterranean, lad.<br> We'll sweep the seas for England.<br>
