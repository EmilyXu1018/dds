                        In the old days when I was a child<br> They used to hang our murderers at the Four-Turnings crossroads.<br> This is what one moment of passion can bring on a man Philip.<br> As long as I can remember old tom was never anything but dull and honest.<br> But whatever the cause<br> One day there came a moment of uncontrollable anger.<br> And when it was over<br> This is what he had earned for himself.<br> For this is the price for murder.<br> That was 15 years ago.<br> But I should have remembered his words.<br> Death...<br> Is the price for murder.<br> My entire life has been spent on the Cornish coast of England.<br> There for more than a hundred years<br> There stood the solid comfortable home<br> In which I grew up from infancy<br> In the care of my cousin Ambrose<br> What is it?<br> Open it.<br> Happy birthday dear boy.<br> My parents died when I was but a few months old.<br> From then on as long as he lived<br> Abrose was not only my kinsman and guardian<br> But father brother friend everything in the world to me.<br> And just two years ago<br> On the stormiest night that I can remember<br> Distant bells began to toll for him.<br> And now they tell me if I spend another winter in this blasted rain<br> I'll end up a cripple in a bath chair.<br> So I must go in search of the sun I suppose.<br> Where will you go?<br> Italy perhaps.<br> Somewhere around the mediterranean.<br> Well uh you'll want me toNgo with you won't you?<br> I'd want you of course<br> But I don't think...<br> Think both of us should be away from here at the same time.<br> You don't think you'll need someone to<br> Help you in and out of carriages and all that sort of thing?<br> Good heavens no. I'm not exactly an invalid yet.<br> The real trouble is...<br> I'm too much of a fool about my home. I...<br> I hate to leave it even for a week.<br> Well this must be for months.<br> And so today the Four-Turnings crossroads<br> Is an even uglier place to me.<br> But it was there that I bade him farewell<br> For the last time.<br> This is far enough.<br> You don't want to be late getting back.<br> Goodbye dear boy.<br> Goodbye Ambrose.<br> Goodbye Louise.<br> Goodbye.<br> Better keep an eye on this one don't you think?<br> She's coming along pretty fast now.<br> ever mind about me.<br> What we want to know is<br> Who's going to keep an eye on you?<br> What did I tell you?<br> Drive on.<br> Goodbye children. I'll see you in the spring.<br> Goodbye Ambrose.<br> Goodbye Ambrose. God bless you.<br> But when winter had passed<br> And we were well into spring again<br> And still there was no sign of his returning<br> I came to be troubled by strange and formless fears<br> Wholly without reason but persistent and nagging.<br> And in some ways... ominous.<br> Good morning.<br> ick!<br> What news from our tourist now?<br> Still in Florence.<br> Can't seem to tear himself away from some people he's met there.<br> Oh who are they?<br> Have you ever heard of a family from these parts named Corren?<br> One of them once married to a member of our family?<br> Oh yes I remember the Correns. Why?<br> He writes that he's met one of them in Florence.<br> A countess Tangeletti half English half Italian a widow.<br> How old is she?<br> He doesn't say but middle aged I suppose<br> Married and widowed and so on.<br> She's been showing them the gardens in Florence.<br> When's he coming home?<br> Didn't even mention it this time.<br> Is it really true sir?<br> It is.<br> What is it dear?<br> Where's your father?<br> Here I am. What's the trouble?<br> Another letter.<br> I want you to hear it yourself.<br> My dearest boy all is not well with me.<br> - Keeps silent though she watches me all the time.<br> I have written to you several times.<br> There is no one here I can trust.<br> Unless I can get out myself to post the letters<br> They may not reach you.<br> Since my illness this has been more difficult than ever.<br> As for the doctors<br> I have no belief in any of them.<br> They are all liars.<br> And the new one recommended by our friend Rainaldi<br> I'm sure is a complete cutthroat.<br> But then he would be coming from that quarter.<br> However they've taken on a dangerous proposition in me<br> And I will beat them yet. Ambrose<br> Look at the writing.<br> I can't believe it.<br> ot believe what?<br> It's not the letter of a man in his right senses.<br> That's not it.<br> There've been hints before in exactly the same tone.<br> There is nothing the matter with Ambrose's mind.<br> You may not know this<br> But Ambrose's father died of a tumor on the brain.<br> It was never a matter much discussed in the family<br> And i've no idea whether these things are hereditary or not<br> or do the doctors seem to know.<br> The only other possibility I can think of<br> And one I would infinitely prefer<br> Is that Ambrose was drunk when he wrote this letter.<br> I've never seen Ambrose drunk in my life.<br> or I.<br> I was merely trying to choose the better of two evils.<br> Well whatever the truth we'll know it soon.<br> I'm leaving for Florence first thing tomorrow morning.<br> Pull up a minute please.<br> Isn't that the post bag?<br> Yes sir?<br> Let me see the letters please.<br> Yes sir.<br> Thank you. Thank you sir.<br> Drive on.<br> Villa Sengeletti?<br> Si.<br> Signor Ashley. Is here?<br> o no Signor...<br> Then Signora Ashley?<br> Excuse me.<br> Do you understand English?<br> Yes Signor.<br> Would you be good enough to announce me to Mr. Ambrose Ashley.<br> Excuse Signore but you are Mr. Ashley's son?<br> o his cousin.<br> Is he here or not?<br> I'm very sorry Signore but he's not.<br> He's dead.<br> Since three weeks now.<br> Would you care for a glass of wine Signore?<br> o. Thank you.<br> How did he die?<br> From the fever Signore.<br> I mean was it quick... or... or slow.<br> The illness was long and slow.<br> But the end was quick.<br> He fell asleep truly.<br> You saw it?<br> Yes Signore.<br> It was very early in the morning<br> And Sr. Rainaldi sent me for the doctor.<br> But it was too late.<br> I myself helped the Contessa to light the candles.<br> And when the nuns are gone I went back to look at him again.<br> The violence had all gone now<br> And on his face it was a look of peace.<br> What do you mean by violence?<br> During the fever Signore<br> There were many times I had to hold him down in bed<br> When the attacks come on.<br> And when the pain went<br> He would be dazed and heavy his mind wondering<br> That was the way it was.<br> The whole winter. A strong man. As helpless at last... as a child.<br> And uh Mrs. Ashley is she still here?<br> o Signore. She moved out the day after the funeral.<br> Sr. Rainaldi thought it best.<br> Mr. Ashley's things?<br> She packed them all up and...<br> What about this?<br> She must have overlooked it Signore.<br> I see.<br> And if there's no objection. I'll take it along for myself.<br> Of course.<br> And this... Signore Rainaldi.<br> You say he was of great help and comfort to Mrs. Ashley during her...<br> Ordeal.<br> He never left the villa during that entire week.<br> He was their true friend as well as lawyer.<br> Where can I find him now?<br> In the Via Derona Signore. Is the first house on the left after the fountain.<br> Thank you.<br> Is this Signor Rainaldi's...<br> o thank you.<br> Avanti!<br> Mr. Ashley?<br> Yes.<br> Philip Ashley a kinsman of Ambrose.<br> I can see the resemblance.<br> Will you have a chair sir?<br> I've just come from the Villa Sangaletti Mr. Rainaldi.<br> I know. You have Ambrose's stick.<br> You have no objection I trust?<br> How could i?<br> It would have been sent to you anyway.<br> It was in that empty house Mr. Rainaldi and from the lips of a servant<br> That I first learned of the death of my cousin.<br> I regret the circumstances I assure you.<br> Why was I not informed at least of his illness?<br> Your cousin's death was quite sudden Mr. Ashley.<br> ot so sudden apparently that he hadn't time to write me these letters.<br> Yes she was afraid that he might have written something like this.<br> The doctors warned her he might.<br> Why did they warn her?<br> Because of his behavior.<br> Which became quite strange and secretive during those last few weeks.<br> ot without reason of course.<br> On the contrary<br> With a very good reason.<br> The tumor they said was beginning to press on his brain.<br> They said he had a tumor?<br> That was the cause of his death.<br> May I ask what proof there is of that?<br> Certainly.<br> This is a copy of the certificate of death signed by both doctors.<br> A second copy was posted to you at the time<br> And a third to the trustee of your cousin's will Mr. icholas Kendall of Cornwall.<br> How did you know Mr. Kendall was the trustee of the his will?<br> I read it in the will.<br> You read my cousin's will?<br> Certainly he showed it to me.<br> May I ask how he disposed of the estate?<br> In effect to you.<br> All of it?<br> In trust I believe until your 25th birthday.<br> What about her?<br> There was no mention of Mrs. Ashley in the will filed for probate.<br> She'll take action of course to break it.<br> On the contrary<br> I have already written Mr. Kendall our entire approval of its terms.<br> I wish I could say that your<br> Explanation of his illness satisfied me<br> But it doesn't.<br> Regardless of those doctors<br> Regardless of that paper<br> Those are not the letters of a man simply sick<br> They are the letters of a man in danger<br> Surrounded by enemies.<br> Sick not only in body but in mind too remember.<br> He was failing fast.<br> What of this?<br> "She as done for me at last. Rachel my torment."<br> What explanation do you have for that?<br> Are you any sort of student of medical history Mr. Ashley?<br> Of course not.<br> There is a particular affliction of the brain in the case of a tumor<br> Or similar growth which results in the sufferers becoming troubled with delusions<br> He fancies for instance that he's being watched<br> That the person nearest to him such as his wife<br> Is either turned against him or is unfaithful or seeks to take his money<br> o amount of love or persuasion can relieve him of this suspicion<br> Once it takes hold.<br> If you don't believe me or this book which you may take with you<br> Ask an English doctor your own perhaps.<br> Then why didn't she send for me?<br> If Ambrose had lost faith in her<br> Why not send for the one closest of all to him.<br> You're very young aren't you Mr. Ashley...<br> My age is not the question here!<br> Why was I not sent for at once?<br> I wished only to make the point<br> That I am older than you<br> And have probably had more experience with women.<br> The Contessa is a woman of very strong feelings.<br> And such women do not acknowledge defeat easily.<br> They cling to the things they want.<br> They never surrender actually.<br> Where is she now?<br> I have no idea.<br> She left Florence yesterday without telling me where she was bound.<br> When she wishes me to know where she is she will write to me.<br> Is there anything more I may do for you while you're here?<br> o thank you.<br> If you wish to see the grave before you leave<br> It's in the protestant cemetery.<br> The stone ordered by Mrs. Ashley is already in place I believe.<br> When she returns<br> Tell her I was here<br> Tell her for me I went to the villa and heard how Ambrose died<br> And tell her also about the letters he wrote to me.<br> I will. If she returns.<br> But Mrs. Ashley is also one of impulse<br> And there is no assurance that she will ever come back to Florence again.<br> Good day sir.<br> There beside his grave I made a vow.<br> I swore that whatever it had cost Ambrose in pain and suffering<br> I would return it in full measure.<br> Because I did not believe Rainaldi's story.<br> I believed in the truth of the two letters that I held in my right hand.<br> Someday somehow I would repay my cousin Rachel.<br> I must say you're a great deal prompter than I've been accustomed to with you.<br> We raced.<br> It's the only way to get him anywhere on time.<br> Will you be long?<br> I don't think so.<br> Then if you'll excuse me i'll change and we'll have some tea.<br> Such mystery<br> Don't look at me I don't know what it is.<br> Well.<br> Philip.<br> I've odd news for you.<br> Yes?<br> Mrs. Ashley is here.<br> In this house?<br> In plymouth.<br> She arrived by ship two days ago.<br> She writes to tell me of abrose's death.<br> Apparently she knows nothing of your visit to Florence.<br> I think you should read it.<br> I think it would impress you.<br> What's she after? A settlement?<br> o.<br> She only wants to return the remainder of Ambrose's possessions.<br> His books his papers. Old clothes.<br> She wants to bring them here herself I suppose.<br> To judge from this letter the one from Rainaldi last week<br> She wants nothing more of us not one shilling.<br> Although I believe that as the widow she might properly make some kind of claim on the estate.<br> Claim? After driving him to his death?<br> That's a very foolish thing to say Philip.<br> And I wouldn't repeat it if I were you.<br> If ever she heard such a charge<br> She would be well within her rights to bring a case against you for slander.<br> Well within her rights.<br> If Ambrose had thought she deserved it.<br> He would have left his wife something<br> The whole estate in fact and you know it.<br> Unless he was too ill to recognize his obligations.<br> But surely you don't believe that story of the tumor.<br> I do now yes.<br> Here is her record here is Rainaldi's and here is the death certificate.<br> In addition to which I remember Ambrose's father's death.<br> The symptoms were quite similar.<br> Well you may but I don't not for a minute.<br> You mean you won't.<br> She doesn't even ask to see the house.<br> The house that would have been her home had Ambrose lived.<br> Instead of which a lonely hostelry in plymouth.<br> You touch me nick.<br> I'm sorry Philip.<br> As Ambrose's friend<br> I can't sit here and do nothing<br> When his widow arrives alone and friendless in this country.<br> I shall invite her to come here and stay with us.<br> Until her plans are formed.<br> I know you won't want to see her<br> So if she accepts my invitation<br> I won't ask you over while she's here.<br> On the contrary. I'd like very much to see her.<br> Perhaps you'll write that to her.<br> Tell her that Philip Ashley is rather a plain man<br> Living in rather a plain fashion with no fine manners whatsoever.<br> But if she wishes to see him and her late husbands home<br> The house will be completely at her disposal whenever she cares to visit.<br> You think for one moment she'd accept an invitation like that?<br> Send it along and we'll see whether she will or not.<br> Welcome Mrs. Ashley.<br> Thank you Seecombe<br> She has come sir.<br> She was due here at five. It's now nearly seven. I should hope she has.<br> Did you explain I was too busy to be here to meet her?<br> She said she understood sir.<br> Where is she now?<br> In her room sir.<br> Am I to understand that she's already dined without waiting for me?<br> Oh no sir. She had a tray in her room.<br> She was very tired after the journey and asked that you excuse her this evening.<br> She told me to tell you sir<br> That if you wish to see her after dinner she'd be pleased receive you.<br> In her room?<br> Yes sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Come in<br> Good evening.<br> Why!<br> How are you Philip?<br> I.. Uh.. Hope you feel better now.<br> Very much thank you. Will you sit with me for a few minutes?<br> I owe you an apology for not coming down to dinner<br> After you had gone to so much trouble to make the house bright and beautiful for me but<br> I was very tired and dull.<br> It's quite all right I understand.<br> I do hope you didn't hurry home before you should of.<br> o the.. Uh.. Work was all quite done.<br> You mustnt believe me make any kind of alteration in your days because of me.<br> I just wanted to say one thing... which is...<br> Thank you Philip for letting me come.<br> It can't have been easy for you.<br> You are quite welcome i'm sure.<br> You've no idea what a strange feeling it was<br> Driving through the park and up to the house<br> With Seecombe standing by the door to greet me.<br> Everything was just as I had mentioned it:<br> The hall the pictures even the clock striking four as I came in the door.<br> Was don really fourteen on his last birthday?<br> Yes.<br> His birthday if a few weeks before my own.<br> I know. You found him in a pie for your breakfast.<br> Ambrose watched you open it from behind a screen in the dining room.<br> He said he'd never forget the look of amazement on your face<br> When you lifted the crust and a puppy struggled out.<br> What an amazing thing for you to know.<br> Why I probably know a good many more things about you than you'd ever imagine.<br> Yes.<br> Thank you Seecombe.<br> Shall I take the dog out now ma'am.<br> I suppose so.<br> Come on don.<br> What about breakfast ma'am? Mr. Philip has his in the dining room at 8 o'clock.<br> Would it be too much trouble for me to have mine in my room?<br> ot at all ma'am.<br> I'll ring when i'm awake.<br> Very good ma'am. Will there be anything else?<br> o thank you. Goodnight.<br> Goodnight. Goodnight sir.<br> Ambrose used to say no woman was fit to look at before eleven.<br> Would you like a cup?<br> I can hardly believe it!<br> Believe what?<br> My eyes. I've never seen Seecombe serve tea before in my life.<br> He did it very well don't you think?<br> I'll show you something else.<br> I've never seen this tray before<br> or the teapot nor the kettle.<br> I didn't think you had.<br> I saw that look on your face when he entered.<br> And i'll tell you something else too.<br> What<br> I don't think he'd ever seen them before either.<br> That butter's melting. You'd better lick your fingers.<br> Would you like to smoke now?<br> In here?<br> If you'd like to.<br> I would indeed. When Mrs. Pascoe comes we don't even smoke in the drawing room.<br> This is not a drawing room.<br> It's a boudoir.<br> And i'm not Mrs. Pascoe.<br> I thought women minded about such things.<br> What they do when there's nothing better to worry about.<br> This was aunt Phoebe's room wasn't it?<br> Was it?<br> Before you were born.<br> It may have been.<br> All I remember of aunt Phoebe is simply a name.<br> Ambrose never told you of her great romance?<br> Why no.<br> Aunt Phoebe got lovesick of the curate<br> And went away to Tunbridge to mend her broken heart<br> But the heart proved stubborn<br> And Aunt Phoebe took a chill that lasted 20 years.<br> Are you sure you haven't heard of this?<br> ever.<br> What happened then?<br> The chill left her after 20 years<br> At the sight of another curate<br> But by then she was five and forty<br> And her heart was not so brittle<br> So she married the second curate.<br> And.. Uh.. Was the marriage a success?<br> o. As a matter of fact. She died on her wedding night.<br> But I think I better not tell you the circumstances<br> Until we've known each other a little longer.<br> [Singing rock of ages]<br> Well?<br> I can't tell. She's got a veil on.<br> I'm afraid the service won't go on until you lift your veil.<br> Oh I'm sorry.<br> By George that's a good-Looking woman.<br> Quite young too.<br> I remember too another custom he was fond of.<br> Sunday lunch with the kendalls and the pascoes.<br> And I wonder with Philips permission<br> If we might enjoy it together today.<br> Will you join us?<br> Then Louise if would be willing to drive back with Philip<br> Perhaps Ambrose's oldest friend<br> Would invite me to ride with him in his carriage.<br> othing would give me greater happiness Mrs. Ashley.<br> Thank you Mr. Kendall.<br> We'll see you soon then.<br> Will you?<br> Oh dear me indeed!<br> Well what did she say?<br> About what?<br> Didn't you charge her?<br> ot yet.<br> Haven't you said anything at all to her about the way he died?<br> o.. Uh.. I haven't had the right opportunity.<br> But... I thought that's why you invited her here.<br> It is and I intend to at the right moment.<br> I must say she's not all the sort of person I thought she'd be.<br> You've seen that for yourself.<br> She's very beautiful.<br> You really think so?<br> But.. Middle aged of course.<br> Quite 35 I should say.<br> Wouldn't you?<br> I have no idea. I care less.<br> She could be 99 for all I know.<br> At 99 women don't have eyes like that<br> Or that complexion<br> or do they dress like that.<br> Or look so well...<br> I love the stillness of a room after a party don't you?<br> You weren't bored?<br> They couldn't have been pleasanter.<br> And your Louise is charming.<br> She'll make you an excellent wife.<br> Louise is dear but she's not mine.<br> She's still only a child now.<br> At your age i'd suppose you think that.<br> You teasing me?<br> ot in any way.<br> It's just that i'm very happy.<br> It's been a wonderful visit for me.<br> It's not over is it?<br> But of course. I came only for the weekend.<br> You forget i've a new life to make for myself.<br> Why did he never make another will?<br> D'you know?<br> Does that matter now?<br> The fact remains that I can't afford to be idle.<br> I must look for work of some kind.<br> In London I suppose.<br> But you'll invite me down again won't you?<br> I don't know.<br> You don't know?<br> I mean i... don't know whether you want to come again or not.<br> I'm afraid I haven't been altogether honest with you.<br> How do you mean?<br> I should have told you I suppose<br> Ambrose wrote to me during his illness.<br> Did you know that?<br> o.<br> He wanted me<br> He begged me<br> To come to Florence<br> To help him.<br> But I arrived there too late.<br> Have you been to Florence?<br> Yes.<br> When?<br> How long ago?<br> I spent one night there.<br> The night of august 15th.<br> Right after I left.<br> So... Rainaldi told me.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Why have you let me stay here two whole days<br> Without mentioning such a thing?<br> I thought at first you knew.<br> What did he tell you?<br> I think you should read them yourself.<br> The long one came first<br> Then the short one.<br> Only these two?<br> That's all.<br> How you must have hated me!<br> Yes.<br> Why did you ask me here?<br> To accuse you.<br> Of what?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Perhaps of breaking his heart.<br> Which would be murder wouldn't it?<br> And then?<br> I hadn't planned beyond that.<br> I knew only that I wanted to make you suffer<br> And to watch you while you suffered.<br> And then I suppose to...<br> To let you go.<br> Then it was merciful of you.<br> More merciful than I should deserve.<br> If that was what you wanted!<br> Watch me...<br> Watch me now...<br> Watch me as much as you wish!<br> Rachel.<br> Please!<br> Thats no use either<br> When we both remember what he wrote.<br> I can forget<br> If you will<br> But why should you?<br> How do you know different?<br> Because you are not that women.<br> You're not the woman I hated.<br> That was someone who existed only in his...<br> Poor sick mind.<br> That's very generous of you Philip<br> I was a fool.<br> o. ot at all.<br> Someday when i'm not so tired i'd like to tell you about it.<br> About Ambrose and myself<br> And our marriage.<br> As much of it as i understand anyway.<br> I'd never even met a man like this<br> Strong tender without conceit of any kind.<br> I think for the first time in my life I knew what peace was.<br> Most for him.<br> He was like someone sleeping<br> Who'd wakened suddenly<br> And found the world with all its beauty<br> And sadness too.<br> Guido Rainaldi<br> Whom he detested as much as you probably do<br> Guido told me once that Ambrose wakened to me<br> As some men waken to religion.<br> But a woman-Unhappily- Is not religion<br> She's a human being with human thoughts.<br> And she shouldn't be judged by the same rules.<br> He expected too much of you?<br> Her halo can be a lovely thing<br> But she much be able to take it off now and again<br> And be human occasionally.<br> In any case-Finally-Religion doesn't always improve a person.<br> And waking to the world didn't help Ambrose.<br> He changed.<br> His nature changed.<br> How?<br> That's a question I wish from the bottom of my heart<br> I could answer.<br> The doctors said it was his illness.<br> That out of pain and fear these deep hidden thoughts<br> And suspicions came at long last to the surface.<br> But how can I be sure?<br> That it wasn't something in me that brought them out.<br> Will you get a candle and light me upstairs?<br> Of course.<br> Thank you.<br> You're quite sure you don't hate me now?<br> Why should i?<br> I'm very glad for it. Goodnight.<br> He's penniless i'm sure.<br> That Italian friend of hers was a little vague about it<br> But Ambrose wrote if you remember<br> That everything she possessed including the villa<br> Would have to be sold to pay off Sangaletti's debts.<br> She's certainly entitled to something.<br> How much would you suggest?<br> Five thousand pounds a year.<br> Five thousand?<br> To be paid to her quarterly from the day of Ambrose's death.<br> You don't think that's a trifle overgenerous?<br> How can one be overgenerous with property<br> That might have been due her anyway?<br> Very well.<br> If you insist i'll direct the bank to make the payments.<br> A sum like that...<br> It's almost better than being mentioned in the will.<br> To my distant but very dear cousin.<br> To mine with a heart full of love and gratitude.<br> And now...<br> Before the others arrive.<br> Merry christmas dear Rachel.<br> ow?<br> If you will.<br> Philip darling.<br> Put it on.<br> The most beautiful thing i've ever seen in my life.<br> Thank you darling.<br> Forgive me Mrs. Ashley but I really must comment on it.<br> That's the most beautiful pearl necklace i've ever seen.<br> Thank you. It's a very proud possession.<br> Philip i've had a communication from the bank<br> Which I find decidedly disturbing.<br> Yes.<br> It seems that in less than three months<br> Your cousin Rachel has overdrawn her account more than double.<br> Well?<br> You don't regard that as an extraordinary situation?<br> Why should i?<br> What she does with her money is no affair of ours.<br> Well I do.<br> And the only explanation I can find is<br> That she's sending the money out of the country.<br> Whatever she does with it<br> The only important point is that obviously whatever we gave her was not enough.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> We know she had debts. We know she's a generous woman.<br> I want you to increase her allowance at once<br> And in addition to issue a check to cover that overdraft.<br> Philip you're being very wayward.<br> I've been constantly worried in fact by the direction<br> In which your emotions have been carrying you recently.<br> The county for one thing has not failed to note<br> The length of your cousin's stay in this house.<br> I'm not interested in the gossip of old women thank you.<br> For another you had no right to take that necklace from the family collection<br> It was not yours and won't be for another three months yet.<br> What of it? It'll be mine then won't it?<br> The entire estate will be yours then.<br> But until then not one item of it.<br> Very well then i've loaned to her for three months.<br> Is there any harm in that?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm not sure.<br> What are you suggesting that she might take it and sell it?<br> Quite by chance recently<br> I've come to learn a little more about your cousin Rachel.<br> Such as what?<br> It happened I came across some old friends who've been<br> Who've been wintering in france and Italy over a period of years.<br> It seems they met your cousin when she was married to Sangaletti.<br> And?<br> Both were notorious for unbridled extravagance<br> And their own tell points loose living.<br> The duel in which Sangaletti died was fought because of another man.<br> These people said...<br> Don't you ever talk to anyone but gossips?<br> These people said that when they heard of Ambrose's marriage<br> To the countess Sangaletti they were horrified.<br> They predicted she would run through his fortune in a matter of months.<br> I'm sorry to have to tell you all this Philip.<br> But my friends are responsible people they're not given to idle gossip.<br> I've never heard anything so despicable!<br> Who are these people anyway?<br> Oh it doesn't matter.<br> All that's important for the moment is that necklace.<br> You know it's tradition very well.<br> You must explain this to her and ask her to return it to the collection.<br> ot in a thousand years.<br> Then I must do it for you.<br> I forbid you sir.<br> You will not utter one word to Mrs. Ashley on the subject.<br> The necklace is now hers.<br> Philip you are very young very impressionable.<br> And I quite understand your wanting to give your cousin some token of esteem<br> But family jewels are rather more than that<br> Particularly that necklace.<br> So as your guardian and executor of the estate<br> I must be firm about it.<br> If you won't ask Mrs. Ashley to return it I shall.<br> I'm sorry but I couldn't help overhearing.<br> But I assure there's no need for either of you to be embarrassed.<br> It was dear of Philip to let me wear this for the evening.<br> But quite right of you Mr. Kendall to insist on its return. Here.<br> I shan't forget this nick.<br> Philip please.<br> You mustn't mind really.<br> I was proud to have worn it for even that once.<br> I wanted you to wear it for always.<br> I know. I understand<br> But that stupid unspeakable old...<br> You're acting like a child. It doesn't matter I assure you. ot in the least.<br> I'm not a child. I must ask you to please remember that.<br> But I do I do darling.<br> I'm five and twenty all but three blasted months.<br> I object to any further patronage from anybody.<br> My mother wore those pearls on her wedding day.<br> Before that my aunt.<br> Before that my grandmother.<br> Don't you realize why I wanted you to wear them too?<br> Bless you.<br> At last!<br> Good evening sir.<br> We've been waiting for you. You remember Guido of course.<br> Of course.<br> I must apologize for coming without an invitation.<br> But then neither did I expect you when you called on me.<br> You're welcome here sir.<br> He should be scolded though.<br> Imagine his being in England a week without letting me know.<br> I couldn't be more surprised when he walked in.<br> Will you have glass Philip?<br> Thank you no i...<br> I think I should bathe and change first if you'll excuse me.<br> Hurry and we'll see you at dinner.<br> I'm not certain uh...<br> ow Philip?<br> It's a pleasure to see you here sir.<br> It's very good of you to say so.<br> He reminds me of only of one person.<br> May I ask what that is?<br> Tisane. Guido's favorite tisane.<br> Which he says nobody can make as well as myself.<br> o one can make any tisane so well as your cousin.<br> I'm sure she knows more about herbs than any other person in the world.<br> Yes but what is it a tisane?<br> I'm sorry I should have introduced you to it long before now.<br> It's a tea made from herbs a mixture of herbs.<br> In Italy it's a very ancient art<br> With endless variations in flavor and strength and purposes etc.<br> Some of it for pleasure some for the health.<br> Ambrose loved it and if you like it we'll have it again.<br> For this young man it must always be for pleasure.<br> For I can imagine no one standing less in need of more health.<br> Have you ever had an illness in your life.<br> ot that I can remember.<br> Doesn't it worry you?<br> Why should it?<br> Because such people are so often the first to go when finally they are stricken.<br> Haven't you heard that?<br> I'm unalarmed by the situation.<br> It is probably all this violent riding and walking and swimming<br> That young Englishmen do. It develops the wrong portion of the body.<br> ow. In Italy...<br> Would you figure this Philip?<br> Guido and I have a good deal of rather dull business to discuss.<br> And I believe it can be done more conveniently upstairs.<br> Certainly.<br> Will you join us later?<br> I'm afraid not thank you. I'm rather tired really.<br> If you change your mind come in at any time.<br> It is very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home.<br> I trust that... you'll be comfortable.<br> And I must thank you too for all you have done for your cousin.<br> She wrote to me about the allowance.<br> You might be pleased to know that that was precisely what<br> She had planned for you if the other will had been signed.<br> What other will?<br> She didn't tell you?<br> o one's told me of any other will.<br> Then perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it.<br> evertheless there was one with a more normal arrangement.<br> He left all this the entire estate to his widow.<br> But unfortunately by the time it was drawn and copied<br> Orlando's collapse was complete and it was never signed.<br> You still have a copy though of course.<br> o. We destroyed it.<br> You'll pardon me. May I ask you what sense you use the word "we?"<br> Is it royal or domestic?<br> either sir it's legalistic. For lawyer and client.<br> Though I confess I expect some day to be able to use it in a sense more intimate.<br> When that day comes I shall of course be happy to congratulate you.<br> Thank you sir. Your graciousness helps me to understand<br> We both regret your cousin will leave here.<br> If and when she does?<br> I understand.<br> Goodnight sir.<br> Goodnight.<br> You'll have to go further than this to skip me.<br> How did you know I was here?<br> You're always here when you're angry with me.<br> We'll have to go back. It's far too cold for you here.<br> ot if we sit close and you put your arms around me.<br> You didn't come to say goodnight.<br> You didn't really expect me to.<br> I waited up for you till after eleven.<br> With your friend?<br> A good hour after I'd sent him up to bed.<br> Is that true?<br> But of course. Why do you ask that?<br> Where is he now?<br> On his way back to London.<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> You're a goose.<br> You really do think me a fool don't you?<br> I told you not to say that. It's absurd.<br> I become fonder and fonder of you in fact each day that passes.<br> And each day that passes i'm more and more determined that I shall never let you leave here.<br> Date it today if that's necessary but make it effective tomorrow which is my birthday.<br> Very well<br> At midnight tonight the property becomes mine absolutely<br> And there can be no objections whatever from anyone as to what I do with it.<br> I've never heard of such a thing before in my life.<br> ever!<br> You mean you've never before heard of a wrong being righted.<br> You're quite determined on this?<br> Quite.<br> Does she know about it?<br> othing whatever. The idea is mine and mine alone.<br> But isn't it possible you could satisfy your love or your conscience or whatever it 'tis<br> With something less than the entire estate?<br> But suppose this was what Ambrose himself intended.<br> Until he became too ill to arrange it.<br> We don't know that. ot for a fact.<br> o but I knew Ambrose and so did you.<br> Would he have done anything less for the woman he loved?<br> o. ot if he still loved her.<br> If you let me sign?<br> I'm sorry Philip<br> But I can't help regarding this as the completest folly.<br> I wish now she'd never come to England.<br> Ah but if there's nothing i can say to dissuade you<br> Sign here and I'll witness it.<br> There are some women good women very possibly.<br> Who through no fault of their own impel disaster.<br> Whatever they touch somehow turns to tragedy.<br> Rachel.<br> Wake up Rachel<br> This is not the time for sleeping girl.<br> Wake up and come to the window.<br> Or do you want me to come in and wake you up?<br> Dear Philip.<br> Yes Rachel.<br> What are you doing at this hour?<br> I wanted you to look at the moon and smell the fragrance of spring in the air.<br> But you've been drinking.<br> Only at the springs of love.<br> Here catch this.<br> I'll do no such thing!<br> Catch it I tell you.<br> I do believe you must be really mad.<br> ow pull it.<br> It's heavy.<br> Pull hard.<br> What is it?<br> I'll show you.<br> You idiot! You'll fall and hurt yourself.<br> Only a clod would walk up stairs on such a night.<br> A man in love would scale the wall.<br> Oh do be careful please!<br> Have you taken leave of your senses?<br> Perhaps. And never happier.<br> Please Philip. You can't do this.<br> You must leave at once.<br> Don't you know what the day is?<br> It's not day to begin with.<br> And if it's your birthday you mean that's not till tomorrow.<br> And when pray do you think tomorrow begins.<br> ow Philip you can't mean...<br> Listen!<br> So now it's all yours?<br> o.<br> Yours.<br> I'm cold.<br> Stand by the fire.<br> You remember what your mother used to tell you?<br> What must happen on a birthday.<br> Your hair is wet.<br> I've been swimming in the sea.<br> Philip how could you in this weather?<br> Do you remember?<br> o but it was something foolish I'm sure.<br> Well on a man's birthday his every wish must be granted.<br> o no that's not it at all.<br> That's exactly what you told me not two weeks ago.<br> Only up to the age of ten.<br> There was no such restriction as that.<br> Then there is now. Up to the age of ten and not one day older.<br> Very well then suppose this time we reverse it.<br> The celebrator will try to grant you every wish.<br> Whatever you want.<br> Home.<br> Money.<br> Perhaps these to help you while you decide.<br> Are you out of your mind Philip?<br> o and far from it.<br> It's only that it's my 25th birthday and everything I have is yours.<br> Let me have your hand.<br> And this.<br> This.<br> And this.<br> And<br> This.<br> This is impossible darling.<br> o. This is right.<br> They belong on you.<br> And as to this.<br> You can read it later.<br> What is it?<br> Take it.<br> o Philip.<br> This home. This land. Everything.<br> Which had always been yours anyway.<br> Philip darling.<br> If I owned the world it would be yours too.<br> And all I have for you<br> Is a little pin for your cripethet.<br> Blessed creature.<br> Remember once I told you<br> There was nothing else I needed in the world but<br> The warmth and comfort of these four walls.<br> I remember.<br> I was wrong.<br> I know now that it is something else.<br> Are you very sure of that?<br> More sure than of anything else on earth<br> Of all his willfulness<br> Of all that he provokes and bewilders me at times<br> My regard for you Philip only increases with the years.<br> Your errors have never been mean nor selfish<br> My guardianship is ended today but I rejoice to think<br> You will never cease to be my godson.<br> To your five and twenty years dear boy.<br> Long life and happiness.<br> To you Philip Philip.<br> Thank you ladies.<br> My dear Louise. My dearest Rachel.<br> ow i too have a toast that I wish you to drink tonight.<br> Since this morning I've been the happiest of men.<br> I want you godfather and you Louise<br> To drink to Rachel who is to be my wife.<br> Have you lost your senses Philip?<br> Uh..<br> I'm sorry if it was premature to break the news but<br> It's my birthday and these are my oldest friends.<br> I hope you can forgive this piece of schoolboy folly<br> And forget it if you can.<br> The day and the wine seem to have gone to Philip's head.<br> He'll apologize for his insuffigate.<br> Shall we go to the drawing room<br> I thought you'd gone to bed.<br> ot before I had begged your forgiveness.<br> Then you may go now<br> Before you think up some other mischief to do.<br> I won't betray us believe me.<br> Betray us. What a shameful thing to say.<br> You make me feel like a backstairs servant creeping up to some attic with a groom.<br> Will you let me pass.<br> You know better than that I'm sure.<br> I said will you let me pass?<br> obody said you were ashamed or angry last night when you gave me your promise.<br> What promise?<br> To marry me of course.<br> I promised to marry you last night?<br> But you couldn't possibly have misunderstood.<br> What else could i've been asking that meant everything in the world to me.<br> Whatever you may have thought. I gave you no such promise<br> or anything like it.<br> Then then let me ask you now in the plainest of language.<br> Will you marry me?<br> o Philip and you may take that as final and forever.<br> ow will you let me pass?<br> But you loved me. I know you did. It couldn't have been pretense.<br> That was last night Philip and you had given me the jewels.<br> I was trying to be what else handicaff.<br> You have my heart my mind the property the money the jewels<br> My name you already had.<br> ow leave me. You understand?<br> What are you going to do lecture me?<br> o. I just thought you might want to talk about it.<br> It was my fault last night.<br> I don't believe that.<br> What you said was the truth. Otherwise you wouldn't have said it.<br> I know that.<br> I misunderstood her.<br> You may have<br> But not I. Ever.<br> How d'you mean that?<br> Why do you think she came here<br> All that long distance from Florence?<br> I should think all that was obvious.<br> It was a pilgrimage to Ambrose's home.<br> o no Philip. It wasn't sentiment<br> And it wasn't idle curiosity.<br> She'd quite another purpose in mind and now it's accomplished.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> If you had been older or stronger she'd have never stayed here.<br> She'd have called in my father settled for a sum and gone on her way.<br> Can't you see that yet?<br> If that's what you asked me here to tell me there's not need to continue this discussion.<br> You've never liked her from the day she arrived.<br> Then why has she been sending her allowance<br> Out of the country month after month this whole winter?<br> How can you say a thing like that? When you couldn't possibly know it for a fact.<br> But I do say it and it is a fact.<br> Do you suppose my father and the bank<br> Don't know what she's been doing with her money?<br> But what if she did?<br> She had debts in Florence. I've known that all along.<br> But now don't you see she no longer any need to bleed you bit by bit.<br> Because suddenly you've given her exactly what she set out to get.<br> Everything.<br> May I see you to your carriage?<br> Do you really love her then that much?<br> I've already asked her to marry me twice.<br> And when the time is right I intend to ask her again.<br> I simply cannot believe...<br> She'll never marry you Philip.<br> Perhaps not.<br> Do you know why she brought that document to my father?<br> Yes. Some of it wasn't altogether clear to her.<br> One point in particular.<br> Which was that?<br> The conditions of remarriage.<br> There can't have been any misunderstanding about that.<br> It states simply that if she<br> Remarries while i'm alive the estate simply reverts to me.<br> If she married me the condition would have no meaning actually.<br> Why wouldn't it?<br> Because she'd still share in it? It would be ours together.<br> You're certainly can't be suggesting that she'd refuse to marry me<br> Because she'd no longer own the whole property.<br> o but remember this<br> A wife may cannot take her husband's money into another country such as Italy.<br> or can she herself wander away whenever the impulse seizes her.<br> Beyond that I suggest nothing.<br> Good day.<br> Oh Philip how can you be so blind?<br> How can you let yourself be torn and shamed and humiliated?<br> How can I tell you? Don't you understand?<br> Because I love her and nothing else!<br> It isn't a little loving. It isn't a fancy.<br> It isn't something you'd turn on and off.<br> It's everything I think and feel and want and know.<br> And there's no room in me for anything else<br> And never will be again.<br> ow is it clear to you!<br> Why three?<br> The mistress said there'd be a third for dinner sir.<br> Come in.<br> Come in.<br> Oh look Philip.<br> Mrs. Ashley has found the most exquisite design for the sunken garden.<br> It's Italian of course but<br> This should be could very well be the one below this house. Don't you think?<br> Won't you look at it?<br> She's so clever really to have found an arrangement so suitable.<br> Quite nice and charming.<br> You'll be pleased to hear that Mary's going to be with us for a while now.<br> Oh and such a surprise Philip.<br> When she came to fetch me the others were quite green with envy.<br> Do you play cribbage?<br> I'm afraid not.<br> Well then i'll teach you.<br> I'll teach you both. You'll be wild for it.<br> Tonight after dinner if you wish.<br> May I speak to you alone?<br> I don't see the need.<br> You're quite free to say anything you wish in front of Mary.<br> Oh oh i'm sorry. I must go to my room anyway.<br> You needn't really.<br> Oh but I must to get ready for dinner.<br> Will you leave the doors open please so you can hear if I call?<br> Why yes indeed I will.<br> Why have you done this?<br> You know perfectly well why.<br> You know quite as well it was not in the least necessary.<br> One such display of violence is enough thank you.<br> I don't think I care to be alone with you again.<br> There are matters here that can't be settled<br> In a moments conversation like this with the doors open.<br> Can't I come back here<br> Later in the evening after she's gone to bed?<br> o.<br> How long is she to stay?<br> As long as I choose.<br> I won't deny to order her out myself?<br> I can't really imagine you're being so impertinent<br> As to order a guest of mine out of my house.<br> Are you ill sir?<br> I have a headache.<br> The ladies are in the drawing room. Will you be coming down for dinner?<br> o. o. I'll see you in the morning.<br> You shouldn't have ridden out in weather like today.<br> I knew you'd be sorry for it.<br> Go away and leave me along.<br> I'll tell the mistress that you're not well.<br> Rachel<br> Rachel<br> Mr. Philip.<br> Mr. Philip.<br> My headaches.<br> Has gone promiscuous.<br> What is it dear?<br> Rachel<br> What is it dear?<br> Send her away will you?<br> Isn't the doctor here yet?<br> I won't harm you I promise you I won't<br> Running at midnight eh?<br> And in this weather.<br> He shouldn't have ridden out yesterday either.<br> It's my head!<br> I've seen this fever before.<br> I've seen children die of it.<br> You must do something quickly doctor.<br> Is that how I died?<br> Ambrose!<br> My dear Philip.<br> My headaches.<br> Ambrose.<br> I know dear. I know dear. But if you take this it'll be better soon.<br> Drink it all.<br> Don't ever leave me please.<br> I won't.<br> Will you promise?<br> I promise.<br> But you promised me you'd come back to me.<br> o nobody's going.<br> I won't darling ever.<br> But you said you'd marry me.<br> o Guido I can't.<br> ot while Philip lives.<br> My blessed Rachel. I do love you so.<br> ot more than I love you dear darling.<br> Will you marry me now?<br> I will.<br> With the happiest of hearts.<br> Well. At long last. How do you feel?<br> Strange.<br> Very strange.<br> I shouldn't wonder. You've been very ill for a long time.<br> So welcome home again.<br> How long?<br> More than three weeks.<br> It's not possible.<br> This is a few day's growth.<br> Good heavens.<br> Would you like a mirror?<br> Huh huh no thank you.<br> I feel like Rip Van Winkle.<br> You'll be all right again soon.<br> What was the matter with me?<br> On the continent we called it meningite<br> But none of the doctors here seemed ever to have heard of it.<br> And how did they treat it?<br> We worked it out together.<br> I told them what I had seen done and they did it.<br> Such as puncturing the spine to take out the fluid<br> And letting into your blood a serum I made of herbs.<br> You don't remember that?<br> o.<br> You're an amazing woman.<br> In what respect now?<br> Are you an apothecary too?<br> o.<br> Would you like anything to eat?<br> o.<br> But I am thirsty.<br> Good. I have a cold drink here.<br> Made from limes sent down from London.<br> I feel very sorry for you.<br> Why for me?<br> For having such a poor weak stick of a husband on your hands.<br> Are you sure you don't want me to go with you sir?<br> o. It's only to the sunken garden.<br> I want to surprise Mrs. Ashley.<br> She said I wouldn't be able to walk alone for another week yet.<br> But she's not there sir. She drove into plymouth this morning.<br> You don't know what you're talking about.<br> I heard her make the appointment with the man in change.<br> Come on don.<br> How are you Tamblyn?<br> Well sir thankee.<br> And glad I am to see you out again. Looking so wonderful strong too.<br> I'm feeling better.<br> Trevor.<br> Mr. Philip<br> What's the matter with the tree? Dead?<br> o sir we're moving it to the old orchard.<br> It's getting so big it's dropping its seed over the fence into the meadow.<br> I don't want the cattle to get hold of any.<br> The laburnum seed's poison you know.<br> Did you know they grow in Italy too?<br> Really sir?<br> Yes I remember now. I saw several in Mrs. Ashley's grounds in Florence.<br> Must be wonderful climate. I can understand the mistress wishing to return there.<br> But she doesn't anymore.<br> o sir? I'm glad to hear that.<br> We hear different.<br> That she was just waiting to see you get well again before she went.<br> o this is to be her home from now on.<br> Have you seen her this morning?<br> ot this morning sir.<br> Good morning Collin.<br> Oh Mr. Ashley sir. I must say it's good to see you out and around again.<br> Very much indeed.<br> How's it coming along?<br> Oh well enough I suppose sir.<br> But it's going to be more of an undertaking than we thought.<br> And how's that?<br> The underpinnings are rotten sir.<br> They'll have to be replaced.<br> Can you brace it for the time being?<br> Well we can on Monday sir. When we get some more timber up here.<br> But meanwhile I think you should warn everyone in the house not to use it.<br> That's a long drop down there to those rocks.<br> I will though nobody ever uses it anyway.<br> Did you tell Mrs. Ashley?<br> Why I haven't seen her sir.<br> I expected her but she hasn't been around here this morning.<br> Uh.. All right I'll tell her.<br> Thank you.<br> Good evening Seecombe.<br> Good evening ma'am.<br> Philip dear I'm so pleased to see you down here.<br> ot only down here but about on the grounds too.<br> Alone?<br> Yes. I looked for you.<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> I went into bodmin to do some shopping.<br> I should have told you.<br> Bodmin?<br> Yes I needed some lace.<br> But I thought you said Plymouth?<br> I'm sorry sir I had it from Wellington who thought that it was to be Plymouth again.<br> I tried to last week but I couldn't find what I wanted.<br> What about the headache?<br> o none today. ot the least sign of one.<br> Oh i'm so glad.<br> First day this week without one.<br> Perhaps they're all done at last.<br> I hope so.<br> I heard some gossip today that I don't quite like.<br> What are they saying now?<br> That you're going back to Florence.<br> Of course. But not till you're well.<br> You mean you going back to sell the villa.<br> On no there's not need to do that now.<br> I can afford to keep it now.<br> Then why would you be going?<br> Can't we wait until you're better to discuss that?<br> You mean you'd want to spend the winter there?<br> Possibly or the late summer.<br> There's a good deal of work piled up here since I've been ill.<br> I don't know that I should leave here as soon as that.<br> I don't know that you should either.<br> But you might like to come down in the spring for a visit.<br> I must still be somewhat slow-Witted but<br> Is that how you expect us to live with long separations and visits.<br> Please Philip i've asked you not to talk about the future yet.<br> We still have all the time in the world for that.<br> But I promise you i'll not leave here until you're entirely well.<br> Why should you leave here at all? This is your home now?<br> But so is Florence.<br> That's where most of my friends are.<br> My villa and a certain life that i'm more accustomed to actually than the life here.<br> I'm sure you must understand that I can't help but miss it.<br> I suppose so.<br> I just hadn't thought of it like that.<br> I find I am a little tired after all.<br> You poor dear. Of course you are.<br> Come on. We'll go up together.<br> This is our home really.<br> Our true home.<br> Don't you feel that?<br> It's a warm and comfortable room.<br> Someday we'll going to set a metal plate on the wall here.<br> Here Philip Ashley first set eyes on his cousin Rachel.<br> I think you should go now.<br> Come here.<br> Why must i? Ever.<br> Please Philip.<br> My room is all the lonelier to be sung the area of the ear.<br> I wish that we could tell them now.<br> Tell them what?<br> That we're married now.<br> But we're not Philip.<br> But of course we're married.<br> On my birthday.<br> You can't have forgotten!<br> It 'tis true.<br> Isn't it?<br> It would have been better if you'd let me die.<br> If you say things like that they destroy me too.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I couldn't. ot while you were so ill and weak.<br> You'll understand i'm sure when you're well.<br> And it all seemed so important then.<br> Soon you'll recover soon and you'll swim and sail in the bay<br> And you'll be back about your work again.<br> And in a little while everthing will seem to you just like it was before I came.<br> You really believe that?<br> If I didn't I don't think I should ever have another moment's peace of mind.<br> Is it Rainaldi?<br> o Philip.<br> I know it is. It's always been Rainaldi.<br> Let's not go through all that again.<br> Ambrose knew it too.<br> You've no right to pry into such matters<br> But i'll answer you nevertheless just as i answered Ambrose who hated him too.<br> Guido's a friend to see me through every trial and trouble.<br> You must never misjudge me or try to see me as other than as I am.<br> He knows all my faults and weaknesses but has never condemned me for them.<br> And without his help i should have been lost time and again.<br> He's my only true friend.<br> But friend only.<br> I'd better leave now don't you think<br> After this could there be anything but unhappiness for both of us?<br> Where is he now?<br> Guido?<br> In Florence I imagine.<br> When have ever you told me anything...<br> Any single word since you came into this house<br> But lies?<br> Who's that?<br> Thank you seecomb.<br> One of the many advantages of being in the service Seecombe is<br> That you not called upon to listen to a scolding from the pulpit every sunday morning.<br> How do you feel this morning?<br> Better thank you.<br> Good to see you on your feet Philip.<br> There's whisky in the library nick.<br> Thank you my dear.<br> I'm leaving this evening Philip.<br> There's a vessel sailing in the morning and I booked passage on it.<br> Don't you think we might be friends for the last few hours?<br> Of course we must be.<br> There's an Italian saying that Ambrose loved:<br> Remember only the happy hours.<br> That I think is the way it should be with us.<br> It's a beautiful thought.<br> And in spite of everything we've had many together haven't we?<br> Very happiest.<br> Let me kiss you.<br> There are still moments when I could swear that Ambrose lives all over again in you.<br> Philip! How much better you do look.<br> Thank you.<br> Gracious he does by George.<br> The last time I saw him he looked quite green.<br> Tell me how do you feel?<br> Ever so much better thank you.<br> Ah that's splendid splendid.<br> ow my dear come come.<br> My dear Louise.<br> Are you sure you're quite up to all this?<br> It's precisely what I need all my old friends again.<br> Good.<br> Louise.<br> Are you staying to dinner?<br> obody is.<br> The vicar's got a service and father's going down to the farm.<br> Then you must make some excuse to stay here.<br> I want to see you alone. It's very important.<br> I'll arrange it.<br> Come on you two.<br> Time enough for that when I'm gone.<br> This is my last sunday here and I want it to be as happy as my first<br> With only Philip's and Ambrose's dearest friends around me.<br> Are they gone?<br> All but Miss. Louise.<br> Worthington can drive me home later can't he?<br> Of course.<br> You read Italian don't you?<br> Yes but not very well I'm afraid.<br> There's a letter her somewhere in Italian I want you to read for me if I can find it.<br> They're very dear people particularly Leptkin.<br> And i'm going to miss her more than I can say.<br> This is for you Louise.<br> What is it?<br> It's my special tisane for phillip.<br> I want you to watch how I make.<br> The English way if there should be an English way which I rather doubt is to use pure barley.<br> I brought my own dried herbs from Florence.<br> If you like the taste I'll leave some of them here for you too.<br> In Florence I used to brew my tisane in my room and let it stand for a while.<br> Then Ambrose and I would go out into the courtyard and sit<br> And talk and play. It was very pleasant and peaceful<br> Sipping it slowly while the water dripped into the pool<br> Often until after midnight.<br> I wonder Philip if we couldn't make just such a pleasant place in the sunken garden?<br> Where we might sit in the afternoons.<br> If I could find another little statue like the one in the cor....<br> o. Thank you.<br> ow Philip really. You can't refuse this last cup with me.<br> It's your own brew.<br> You drink it for me.<br> o. It's a pity to waste it.<br> But mine's already poured with the sense of my taste.<br> Yes Seecombe?<br> The man from the bank is here ma'am.<br> Oh yes. Show him into the office.<br> Yes.<br> Will you excuse me for a moment?<br> I have this one last paper to sign.<br> It's a letter from Rainaldi.<br> I'm certain it's in her room somewhere.<br> I have no idea how it can be managed<br> But I should like desperately to get hold of that letter and read it.<br> Why what's happened?<br> I haven't the time to explain.<br> But i'm convinced now that Ambrose was right.<br> She not only murdered him but she's done her best to kill me too.<br> Philip you can't be serious.<br> Every word you uttered in the church that afternoon was the truth.<br> And with that letter i'm positive I can prove it.<br> But not murder surely.<br> How else could she marry her lover and still keep possession of the estate?<br> Wasn't that the particular point you were going to be sure of?<br> You're in a very bad humor today.<br> And i'd like to think it's because i'm leaving.<br> In any case I can't go away<br> Without trying to do something for your sufferings.<br> What is it?<br> A mixture for your tisane.<br> And I want your promise that you'll take it tonight before going to bed.<br> Will you?<br> If you insist.<br> I do.<br> It's helped you before. And it'll help you again.<br> ow. Who'll walk with me to the sunken garden?<br> I've just thought of a little statue I can get in Florence.<br> And I want to make sure in my mind how it'd look from the other side.<br> If you don't mind. Louise must leave in a few minutes.<br> I promised to show her an old map of the estate<br> That some brought to Seecombe yesterday.<br> Of course. You should.<br> Come on.<br> Stand by the window and watch.<br> I'm going to find that letter if I have to....<br> I'm frightened Philip.<br> Unless of course unless she's destroyed it.<br> Rainaldi's been here all the time you know.<br> In Plymouth.<br> She's been seeing him for weeks.<br> She lied about that business and she's lying about...<br> Here's an odd one.<br> It's a reciept from the bank.<br> She sent them back the jewelry collection.<br> Then she's not taking it with her.<br> Very clever of her.<br> Did you look all through the desk?<br> Of course.<br> Have you looked in the blotter?<br> Here.<br> What does it say?<br> Rachel love my ship sails saturday midnight.<br> If I don't see you again before then i'll leave defeated but with no reproaches.<br> I shall continue to serve you with love and friendship as long as I shall live.<br> As for that boy if he's so much in your heart that you cannot bear to leave him<br> By all means bring him back to Florence with you.<br> We'll nurse him back to health.<br> Guido.<br> Oh my god!<br> What is it Philip? What have you done?<br> Go to the bell rope at the foot of the stairs to call the men in.<br> Yes.<br> Go and pull it.<br> Ring it hard! If somethings happened I may need help!<br> [Bell ringing]<br> I'm coming darling. I'm coming.<br> Rachel darling. Please. Please!<br> Rachel.<br> Rachel!<br> Why did you do it?<br> Blessed Rachel.<br> Only you can know now<br> This burden that I must carry to the end of my days.<br> This question that I must ask myself again and again<br> Every day of my life.<br> ever to be answered now<br> Until we meet at last in purgatory.<br> Were you innocent or were you guilty?<br> Rachel my torment.<br> My blessed blessed torment.<br>
