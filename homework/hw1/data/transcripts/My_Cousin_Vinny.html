Improper foundation.<br> I'm not aware of this person's quaIifications.<br> I'd Iike to voir dire this witness|as to the extent of her expertise.<br> Granted.<br> - Mr Trotter, you may proceed.|- Mm-hm.<br> Miss Vito, what's your current profession?<br> - I'm an out-of-work hairdresser.|- Out-of-work hairdresser.<br> Now, in what way does that quaIify|you as an expert in automobiIes?<br> - It doesn't.|- WeII, in what way are you quaIified?<br> WeII, my father was a mechanic.<br> His father was a mechanic.|My mother's father was a mechanic.<br> My three brothers are mechanics.|Four uncIes on my father's side...<br> Miss Vito, your famiIy's obviousIy quaIified.<br> But, uh... have you|ever worked as a mechanic?<br> - Yeah. In my father's garage, yeah.|- As a mechanic?<br> What'd you do in your father's garage?<br> Tune-ups, oiI changes, brake reIining,...<br> ..engine rebuiIds, rebuiIds on trannies...<br> OK. OK. But does being an ex-mechanic|quaIify you as being expert on tyre marks?<br> No. Thank you. Goodbye.<br> Sit down and stay there|untiI you're toId to Ieave.<br> Your Honour. Miss Vito's expertise|is in generaI automotive knowIedge.<br> It is in this area|that her testimony wiII be appIicabIe.<br> Now, if Mr Trotter wishes|to voir dire the witness...<br> ..as to the extent of|her expertise in this area,...<br> ..I'm sure he's gonna|be more than satisfied.<br> OK.<br> AII right. AII right.<br> Now, uh... Miss Vito.<br> Being an expert on|generaI automotive knowIedge,...<br> ..can you teII me...<br> ..what wouId the correct ignition|timing be on a 1955 BeI Air ChevroIet,...<br> ..with a 327 cubic-inch engine,...<br> ..and a four-barreI carburettor?<br> - That's a buIIshit question.|- Does that mean that you can't answer it?<br> It's impossibIe to answer.<br> - Because you don't know the answer!|- Nobody couId answer that question.<br> Your Honour, I move to disquaIify|Miss Vito as a expert witness.<br> - Can you answer the question?|- No. It is a trick question.<br> Why is it a trick question?<br> - Watch this.|- Cos Chevy didn't make a 327 in '55.<br> The 327 didn't come out tiII '62.<br> And it wasn't offered in the BeI Air|with a four-barreI carb tiII '64.<br> However, in 1964 the correct ignition timing...<br> ..wouId be four degrees|before top, dead centre.<br> WeII... Uh...<br> She's acceptabIe, Your Honour.<br> Your Honour, this is a picture taken|by my fiance outside the Sac-o-Suds.<br> Can we agree on this?<br> - Yeah.|- Thank you.<br> I'd Iike to submit this picture|of the tyre tracks as evidence.<br> Mr Trotter.<br> No objection, Your Honour.<br> - Miss Vito.

PIease answer the question.<br> Does the defence's case hoId water?<br> No.<br> - The defence is wrong.|- (murmuring)<br> - Are you sure?|- I'm positive.<br> How couId you be so sure?<br> Because there is no way that these|tyre marks were made by a '64 Buick SkyIark.<br> These marks were made|by a 1963 Pontiac Tempest.<br> Objection. Can we cIarify whether|the witness is stating opinion or fact?<br> - This is your opinion?|- It's a fact.<br> I find it hard to beIieve|that this kind of information...<br> ..couId be ascertained|simpIy by Iooking at a picture!<br> WouId you Iike me to expIain?<br> - I wouId Iove to hear this.|- So wouId I.<br> The car that made these two equaI-Iength|tyre marks had positraction.<br> Can't make those marks without positraction,|which was not avaiIabIe on the '64 SkyIark.<br> - And why not? What is positraction?|- It's a Iimited sIip differentiaI...<br> ..which distributes power equaIIy|to both the right and Ieft tyres.<br> The '64 SkyIark had a reguIar differentiaI...<br> ...which, anyone who's been|stuck in the mud knows,...<br> ..you step on the gas, one tyre spins,|the other does nothin'.<br> That's right.<br> - Is that it?|- No. There's more.<br> When the Ieft tyre mark goes up on the kerb|and the right tyre stays fIat and even...<br> WeII, the '64 SkyIark had a soIid rear axIe,...<br> ..so, when the Ieft tyre goes up on the kerb,|the right tyre tiIts and rides aIong its edge.<br> But that didn't happen here.|The tyre mark stayed fIat and even.<br> This car had an independent rear suspension.<br> Now, in the '60s there were onIy two other|cars made in America that had positraction...<br> ..and independent rear suspension,|and enough power to make these marks.<br> One was the Corvette, which couId never|be confused with the Buick SkyIark.<br> The other had the same body Iength,|height, width, weight,...<br> ..wheeI base and wheeI track|as the '64 SkyIark,...<br> ..and that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.<br> And because both cars were made by GM,...<br> ..were both cars avaiIabIe|in metaIIic mint-green paint?<br> - They were.|- Thank you, Miss Vito.<br> No more questions.|Thank you very, very much.<br> You've been a IoveIy, IoveIy witness.<br> (murmuring)<br> Mr Trotter, wouId you Iike|to question Miss Vito?<br> (judge) Mr Trotter.<br> Mr Trotter!<br> Uh.<br> Uh, no. No, Your Honour.|No further questions.<br> In that case, Your Honour,|I'd Iike to recaII George WiIbur.<br> Miss Vito, you can stand down.<br> You reaIise you're stiII under oath.<br> Yes, Your Honour.<br> Mr WiIbur, how'd you Iike|Miss Vito's testimony?<br> Very impressive.<br> She's cute too, huh?<br> - Yes, very.|- (laughter)<br> - (judge) Mr Gambini.|- Sorry, Your Honour.<br> Mr WiIbur, in your expert opinion,...<br> ..wouId you say that everything Miss Vito|said on the stand was 100% accurate?<br> - I'd have to say that.|- And is there any way in the worId...<br> ..the Buick that the defendants|were driving made those tyre tracks?<br> Come on. You can say. It's OK, they know.<br> ActuaIIy,...<br> - ..no.|- No.<br> Thank you. No more questions.<br> Your Honour, I caII Sheriff FarIey.<br> (judge) You may stand down now, Mr WiIbur.<br> - Sheriff, you reaIise you're stiII under oath?|- Yes, sir.<br> Uh, Sheriff FarIey.<br> - What'd you find out?|- On a hunch,...<br> ..I took it upon myseIf to check if there was|any information on a '63 Pontiac Tempest...<br> ..stoIen or abandoned recentIy.<br> This computer read-out|confirms that two boys,...<br> ..who fit the defendants' description,|were arrested two days ago...<br> ..by Sheriff TiIman|in Jasper County, Georgia,...<br> ..for driving a stoIen metaIIic|mint-green 1963 Pontiac Tempest...<br> ..with a white convertibIe top,...<br> ..MicheIin modeI XGV tyres, size 75R-14.<br> - Is that it?|- No.<br> A .357 Magnum revoIver|was found in their possession.<br> Sheriff FarIey, just to refresh|the court's memory,...<br> ..what caIibre buIIet|was used to murder Jimmy WiIIis?<br> - A .357 Magnum.|- The defence rests.<br> Mr Trotter.<br> Your Honour, in Iight of Miss Vito's|and Mr WiIbur's testimony,...<br> ..the State'd Iike to dismiss aII charges.<br> Order in the court!<br> Order here.<br> I have to get out of here by three.|Make sure aII the bags are in the car.<br> Vinny, I'm sorry to have ever doubted you|at any time, and for this I apoIogise.<br> Under the circumstances... You were|great. I just want to say thank you.<br> You're weIcome. I hope we can do it again.<br> - Fine job, Mr Gambini.|- Thanks.<br> - Y'aII come back and see us any time now.|- I'II see.<br> - Vin.|- BiII.<br> - You're weIcome.|- Vin, I....<br> Listen. Take your time, pick the right words,|get back to New York, gimme a caII.<br> - Vinny, you did a terrific job.|- Thanks.<br> You got an open invitation|any time you come here.<br> - We can get us a deer next time.|- OK. Thanks a Iot.<br> I feeI Iike if I don't get outta here|now, I might never be abIe to Ieave.<br> Mr Gambini.<br> I have a fax here from the cIerk of New York.<br> I owe you an apoIogy, sir.<br> I'm honoured to shake your hand.<br> ''Win some, Iose some.''<br> Your courtroom manner may be rather|unconventionaI, but I gotta teII you,...<br> ..you're one heIIuva triaI Iawyer.<br> Thank you. And you're one heIIuvajudge.<br> Ooh, sorry.<br> (judge) Bye, now.<br> What the heII was that aII about back there?<br> I had a friend send a fax to the judge,...<br> ..confirming the very impressive|IegaI stature of Jerry Callo.<br> What friends you got in the cIerk's office?<br> - Your friend.|- My friend?<br> Judge MaIIoy.<br> So what's your probIem?<br> My probIem is I wanted to win my first case|without any heIp from anybody.<br> WeII, I guess that pIan's moot.<br> Yeah.<br> This couId be a sign of things to come.<br> You win aII your cases,|but with somebody eIse's heIp, right?<br> You win case after case,|and then afterwards,...<br> ..you have to go up to somebody|and you have to say ''Thank you.''<br> Oh, my God. What a fuckin' nightmare!<br> I won my first case.|You know what this means.<br> - Yeah. You think I'm gonna marry you.|- You're not gonna marry me now?<br> No way. You can't win a case by|yourseIf. You're fuckin' useIess.<br> I thought we'd get married this weekend.<br> You don't get it, do you? That is not|romantic.
