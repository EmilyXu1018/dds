What are you talkin'<br> about? Where would I get 60 pounds?<br> - I never offered you 60 pounds!<br> - Hold your tongue!<br> But I ain't got 60 pounds!<br> Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.<br> Nobody's going to touch your money.<br> Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick<br> if you don't stop sniveling.<br> Sit down!<br> Anybody'd think you was my father!<br> If I decide to teach you,<br> I'll be worse than two fathers to you.<br> Here.<br> What's this for?<br> To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part<br> of your face that feels moist.<br> Remember, that's your handkerchief<br> and that's your sleeve.<br> Don't confuse one with the other,<br> if you want to become a lady in a shop.<br> It's no use to talk to her like that.<br> She doesn't understand you.<br> Give the 'andkerchief to me.<br> He give it to me, not to you!<br> Higgins, I'm interested.<br> What about your boast...<br> ...you could pass her off as a duchess<br> at the Embassy Ball?<br> I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive<br> if you do that.<br> I'll bet you all the expenses<br> of the experiment that you can't do it.<br> I'll even pay for the lessons.<br> You're real good.

Take her upstairs!<br> What's to become of her?<br> Is she to be paid anything?<br> Do be sensible, sir.<br> What'd she do with money?<br> She'll have food and clothes.<br> She'll drink if you give her money.<br> You are a brute! It's a lie!<br> Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.<br> Sir, you're a gentleman.<br> Don't let 'im speak to me like that!<br> Does it occur to you, Higgins,<br> the girl has some feelings?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> No feelings we need worry about.<br> Well, have you, Eliza?<br> I got me feelings same as anyone else.<br> Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms<br> the girl is to be here.<br> What'll become of her<br> when you've finished teaching?<br> You must look ahead a little, sir.<br> What'll become of her if we leave her<br> in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?<br> That's her own business,<br> not yours, Mr. Higgins.<br> When I'm done, we'll throw her back.<br> Then it'll be her own business again.<br> That'll be all right, won't it?<br> You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!<br> You don't care for nothin' but yourself.<br> I've 'ad enough of this.

You act<br> as though she doesn't matter at all.<br> Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.<br> What do you think I've been doing<br> all these months?<br> What could possibly matter more<br> than to take a human being...<br> ...and change her into a different human<br> being by creating a new speech for her?<br> It's filling up the deepest gap<br> that separates class from class...<br> ...and soul from soul.<br> Oh, she matters immensely.<br> Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.<br> Thank you, Colonel Pickering.<br> Don't you think so, Higgins?<br> Not bad.

"<br> - I beg you pardon?<br> The young lady with Colonel Pickering...<br> Find out who she is.<br> With pleasure.<br> The whole situation is highly explosive.<br> Tell me, Zoltan,<br> some more about the Greek ambassador.<br> Gladly, but first I would love you<br> to present me to this glorious creature.<br> Does he really come from Yorkshire?<br> Her Majesty,<br> the Queen of Transylvania...<br> ...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.<br> Charming. Quite charming.<br> Miss Doolittle, Madam.<br> Miss Doolittle, my son would like<br> to dance with you.<br> Eliza?<br> PICKERING: Absolutely fantastic.<br> A lot of tomfoolery.<br> PICKERING:<br> It was an immense achievement.<br> Well, Mr. Higgins?<br> A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.<br> Higgins, you were superb,<br> absolutely superb.<br> Tell us the truth now, weren't you<br> a little bit nervous once or twice?<br> Not during the whole evening?<br> Not when I saw we were going to win.<br> I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.<br> It was an immense achievement.<br> If I hadn't backed myself to do it,<br> I'd have given up two months ago.<br> Absolutely fantastic.<br> Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.<br> Higgins, I salute you.<br> The silly people don't know<br> their own silly business.<br> "Tonight, old man, you did it<br> You did it, you did it<br> "You said that you would do it<br> And indeed you did<br> "I thought that you would rue it<br> I doubted you'd do it<br> "But now I must admit it<br> That succeed you did<br> "You should get a medal<br> Or be even made a knight<br> "Oh, it was nothing, really nothing<br> "All alone you hurdled<br> Every obstacle in sight<br> "Now wait, now wait<br> Give credit where it's due<br> "A lot of the glory goes to you<br> "But you're the one who did it<br> Who did it, who did it<br> "As sturdy as Gibraltar<br> Not a second did you falter<br> "There's no doubt about it<br> "You did it!<br> "I must have aged a year tonight<br> At times I thought I'd die of fright<br> "Never was there a momentary lull<br> "Shortly after we came in<br> I saw at once we'd easily win<br> "And after that I found it deadly dull<br> PICKERING: "You should have heard<br> The 'oohs' and 'aahs'<br> "Everyone wondering who she was<br> "You'd think they'd never seen<br> a lady before<br> "And when the Prince of Transylvania<br> Asked to meet her<br> "And gave his arm to lead her to the floor<br> "I said to him: 'You did it<br> You did it, you did it'<br> "They thought she was ecstatic<br> And so damned aristocratic<br> "And they never knew<br> That you...<br> "... did it"<br> Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.<br> If it hadn't been for him<br> I would've died of boredom.<br> Karpathy?

In heaven's name, why?<br> Now listen to me, Eliza.<br> All this irritation is purely subjective.<br> I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.<br> It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.<br> Nobody's hurting you.<br> Go to bed and sleep it off.<br> Have a little cry and say your prayers.<br> You'll feel very much more comfortable.<br> I heard your prayers.<br> "Thank God it's all over. "<br> Don't you thank God it's all over?<br> Now you're free,<br> and you can do what you like.<br> Oh, what am I fit for?<br> What have you left me fit for?<br> Where am I to go?

I'm a common, ignorant girl<br> and in my station I have to be careful.<br> There can't be any feelings between<br> the likes of you and the likes of me.<br> Please, will you tell me<br> what belongs to me and what doesn't?<br> Take the whole damned houseful<br> if you want.<br> Except the jewelry. That's hired.<br> Will that satisfy you?<br> Stop, please.<br> ELIZA: Will you take these to your room<br> and keep them safe?<br> I don't want to run the risk<br> of them being missed.<br> Hand them over! If these belonged<br> to me and not the jeweler, I'd...<br> ...I'd ram them down<br> your ungrateful throat.<br> The ring isn't the jeweler's.<br> It's the one you bought me in Brighton.<br> I don't want it now.<br> Don't you hit me!<br> Hit you?

She's no relation, no.<br> Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Listen to me, I don't like the tenor<br> of that question.<br> What the girl does here is our affair.<br> Your affair is to get her back<br> so she can continue doing it.<br> Well, I'm dashed!<br> "What in heaven<br> could have prompted her to go?<br> "After such a triumph at the ball<br> "What could have depressed her?<br> "What could have possessed her?<br> I cannot understand the wretch at all"<br> PICKERING: I have an old school chum<br> at the Home Office.

Yes, oceans of water.<br> Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.<br> Something rather unpleasant<br> has happened. Could I come and see you?<br> I could, yes. Now, straight away?<br> Right. Good. Thank you.<br> Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.<br> Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along<br> to the Home Office.<br> I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.<br> Mr. Higgins will miss her.<br> Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?<br> Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!<br> Pickering?<br> Mrs. Pearce?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Where's the Colonel?<br> He's gone to the Home Office, sir.<br> There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs<br> for help. Now there's a good fellow.<br> Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.<br> "Why can't a woman<br> be more like a man?<br> "Men are so decent<br> Such regular chaps<br> "Ready to help you<br> Through any mishaps<br> "Ready to buck you up<br> Whenever you are glum<br> "Why can't a woman be a chum?<br> "Why is thinking<br> Something women never do?<br> "And why is logic never even tried?<br> "Straightening up their hair<br> Is all they ever do<br> "Why don't they straighten up<br> The mess that's inside?<br> "Why can't a woman behave like a man?<br> "If I was a woman<br> Who'd been to a ball<br> "Been hailed as a princess<br> By one and by all<br> "Would I start weeping<br> Like a bathtub overflowing?<br> "Or carry on as if my home were in a tree?<br> "Would I run off<br> And never tell me where I'm going?<br> "Why can't a woman be like me?"<br> You mean that after you'd done<br> this wonderful thing for them...<br> ...without making a mistake...<br> ...they just sat there<br> and never said a word?<br> Never petted you, or admired you,<br> or told you how splendid you'd been?<br> Not a word.<br> They just congratulated each other<br> on how marvelous they'd been.<br> The next moment, how glad they were<br> it was all over...<br> ...and what a bore it had all been.<br> This is appalling. I should not<br> have thrown my slippers at him.<br> I should have thrown the fire irons.<br> Who's that?<br> Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.<br> MRS. HIGGINS: Now, remember...<br> ...you not only danced with a prince<br> last night, you behaved like a princess.<br> Mother, the most confounded thing...<br> Do you-<br> You!<br> Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.<br> Are you quite well?<br> Of course you are. You are never ill.<br> Would you care for some tea?<br> Don't you dare try that game on me.<br> I taught it to you.<br> Get up, come home and stop being a fool.<br> You've caused me enough trouble.<br> Very nicely put indeed, Henry.<br> No woman could resist such an invitation.<br> How did this baggage get here?<br> Eliza came to see me this morning<br> and I was delighted to have her.<br> If you don't promise to behave yourself<br> I'll ask you to leave.<br> I'm to put on my Sunday manners<br> for this...<br> ...thing that I created out of the squashed<br> cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?<br> That's precisely what I mean.<br> I'll see her damned first.<br> However did you learn good manners<br> with my son around?<br> It was very difficult. I should never have<br> known how ladies and gentlemen behave...<br> ...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.<br> He showed me that he felt<br> and thought about me...<br> ...as if I were something better<br> than a common flower girl.<br> You see, Mrs. Higgins,<br> apart from the things one can pick up...<br> ...the difference between a lady<br> and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...<br> ...but how she is treated.<br> I'll always be a flower girl<br> to Professor Higgins...<br> ...because he always treats me<br> as a flower girl and always will.<br> I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...<br> ...because he always treats me<br> as a lady and always will.<br> Henry, don't grind your teeth.<br> The bishop is here.<br> Shall I show him into the garden?<br> The bishop and the professor?<br> Good heavens, no!<br> I should be excommunicated.<br> I'll see him in the library.<br> Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...<br> ...I give you full permission<br> to have him evicted.<br> Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:<br> the weather and your health.<br> You've had a bit of your own back,<br> as you say.<br> Have you had enough and will you<br> be reasonable or do you want any more?<br> You want me back to pick up<br> your slippers...<br> ...and put up with your tempers<br> and fetch and carry for you.<br> I didn't say I wanted you back at all.<br> Then what are we talking about?<br> Well, about you, not about me.<br> If you come back you'll be treated<br> as you always have.<br> I can't change my nature or my manners.<br> My manners are exactly<br> the same as Colonel Pickering's.<br> That's not true. He treats a flower girl<br> as if she were a duchess.<br> I treat a duchess<br> as if she was a flower girl.<br> I see. The same to everybody.<br> The great secret is not a question<br> of good manners...<br> ...or bad manners<br> or any particular sort of manner...<br> ...but having the same manner<br> for all human souls.<br> The question is not<br> whether I treat you rudely...<br> ...but whether you've ever heard me<br> treat anyone else better.<br> I don't care how you treat me.<br> I don't mind your swearing at me.<br> I shouldn't mind a black eye.<br> I've had one before this.<br> But I won't be passed over!<br> Get out of my way,<br> for I won't stop for you.<br> You talk about me as though<br> I was a motorbus.<br> So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go<br> and no consideration for anybody.<br> But I can get along without you.<br> Don't you think I can't!<br> I know you can. I told you, you could.<br> You've never wondered, I suppose,<br> whether...<br> ...whether I could get along without you?<br> Don't you try to get around me.<br> You'll have to.<br> So I can, without you or any soul on earth.<br> I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned<br> something from your idiotic notions.<br> I confess that humbly and gratefully.<br> Well, you have my voice<br> on your gramophone.<br> When you feel lonely without me you can<br> turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.<br> Well, I can't turn your soul on.<br> You are a devil!<br> You can twist the heart in a girl<br> just as easily...<br> ...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.<br> What am I to come back for?<br> For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.<br> You may throw me out tomorrow<br> if I don't do everything you want.<br> Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow<br> if I don't do everything you want.<br> And live with my father?<br> Yes, or sell flowers.<br> Would you rather marry Pickering?<br> I wouldn't marry you if you asked me<br> and you're nearer my age then what he is.<br> - Than he is.<br> - I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.<br> That's not what I want<br> and don't you think it is.<br> I've always had chaps enough<br> wanting me that way.<br> Freddy Hill writes me twice<br> and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.<br> In short, you want me to be<br> as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?<br> No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling<br> I want from you.<br> I want a little kindness.<br> I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,<br> and you're a book-learned gentleman...<br> ...but I'm not dirt under your feet.<br> What I done... what I did was not<br> for the taxis and the dresses...<br> ...but because we were pleasant together<br> and I come to... came...<br> ...to care for you.<br> Not to want you to make love to me...<br> ...and not forgetting the difference<br> between us, but...<br> ...more friendly like.<br> Well, of course. That's how I feel.<br> And how Pickering feels.<br> Eliza, you're a fool!<br> That's not the proper answer.<br> It's the only answer<br> till you stop being an idiot.<br> To be a lady, you must stop<br> feeling neglected...<br> ...if men don't spend half their time<br> sniveling over you...<br> ...and the other half giving you black eyes.<br> You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,<br> don't you?<br> Off with you to the sort of people you like.<br> Marry a sentimental hog<br> with lots of money...<br> ...and thick lips to kiss you,<br> and thick boots to kick you.<br> If you can't appreciate what you have,<br> then get what you can appreciate.<br> I can't talk to you.<br> You always turn everything against me.<br> I'm always in the wrong.<br> Don't be too sure you have me<br> under your feet...<br> ...to be trampled on and talked down.<br> I'll marry Freddy, I will,<br> as soon as I'm able to support him.<br> Freddy!<br> The poor devil who couldn't get a job<br> as an errand boy...<br> ...even if he had the guts to try?<br> Don't you understand?<br> I have made you a consort for a king!<br> Freddy loves me.<br> That makes him king enough for me.<br> I don't want him to work.<br> He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.<br> I'll go and be a teacher.<br> What'll you teach, in heaven's name?<br> What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.<br> I'll offer myself as an assistant<br> to that brilliant Hungarian.<br> What, that imposter? That humbug?<br> That toadying ignoramus?<br> Teach him my methods, my discoveries?<br> You take one step in that direction,<br> I'll wring your neck!<br> Wring away! What do I care?<br> I knew you'd strike me one day.<br> That's done you, 'Enry 'Iggins, it 'as.<br> I don't care for your bullyin'<br> an' your big talk.<br> "What a fool I was<br> "What a dominated fool<br> "To think you were the earth and sky<br> "What a fool I was<br> "What an addle-pated fool<br> "What a mutton-headed dolt was I<br> "No, my reverberating friend<br> "You are not the beginning and the end"<br> You impudent hussy!<br> There's not an idea in your head or a word<br> in your mouth that I haven't put there.<br> "There'll be spring every year<br> without you<br> "England still will be here without you<br> "There'll be fruit on the tree<br> And a shore by the sea<br> "There'll be crumpets and tea without you<br> "Art and music will thrive without you<br> "Somehow Keats will survive without you<br> "And there still will be rain<br> On that plain down in Spain<br> "Even that will remain without you<br> "I can do...<br> "... without you<br> "You, dear friend<br> "Who talk so well<br> "You can go to<br> "Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire<br> "They can still rule the land without you<br> "Windsor Castle will stand without you<br> "And without much ado<br> We can all muddle through<br> "Without you!

What's happened?<br> She's gone.<br> Well, of course, dear.<br> What did you expect?<br> What am I to do?<br> Do without, I suppose.<br> And so I shall.<br> If the Higgins' oxygen burns up<br> her little lungs...<br> ...let her seek some stuffiness<br> that suits her.<br> She's an owl sickened<br> by a few days of my sunshine.<br> Let her go.
