                        Hello, Duke.<br> Hello, Mike.<br> Any luck today?<br> I figured out a swell racket,<br> and everything was going great<br> until the cops came along.<br> Too bad it didn't work.<br> If them cops would stick<br> to their own racket,<br> we'd get somewhere<br> in this country...<br> without a lot of this<br> relief and all that stuff.<br> Mike, I wouldn't worry.<br> Prosperity's just around the corner.<br> Yeah. It's been there a long time.<br> I wish I knew which corner.<br> Well, Duke, I'm gonna turn in.<br> - Bonsoir.<br> - Bonsoir, Mike.<br> This is the place, all right.<br> That looks like one of them.<br> - Looks pretty tough to me.<br> - Stall Irene. I'll talk to the fellow.<br> - I told you about this place.<br> - We got here first.<br> Well, she's not gonna<br> get ahead of me.<br> Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - How'd you like to make five dollars?<br> Huh? I didn't quite<br> catch what you said.<br> I said, how'd you like<br> to make five dollars?<br> - Five dollars?<br> - Five dollars.<br> Well, I don't want<br> to seem inquisitive,<br> but what would I<br> have to do for it?<br> All you have to do is go<br> to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,<br> I'll show you to a few people,<br> and then I'll send you right back.<br> May I inquire just why<br> you would want...<br> to show me to people<br> at the Waldorf Ritz?<br> Oh, if you must know,<br> it's a game... a scavenger hunt.<br> If I find a forgotten man first, I win.<br> Is that clear?<br> Yes, quite clear.<br> Shall I wear my tails,<br> or come just as I am?<br> You needn't be fresh. Do you want<br> the five dollars or don't you?<br> Madam, I can't tell you<br> how flattered I am...<br> by your very generous offer.<br> However, I'll have to take it up<br> with my board of directors.<br> - Don't you touch me!<br> - No matter what my directors advise,<br> - I think you should be spanked.<br> - George, do something!<br> Are you in the habit<br> of hitting ladies?<br> I'm in the habit of hitting gentlemen<br> also, if that'll interest you.<br> - Aren't you going to do anything?<br> - Let's get a policeman.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm Irene.<br> That was my sister Cornelia<br> you pushed in the ash pile.<br> - Like me to push Cornelia's sister?<br> - I don't think I'd like that.<br> - Then you'd better get out of here.<br> - Oh, you bet.<br> Wait a minute!<br> Sit down!<br> I'm sitting.<br> What's up, Duke?<br> Need some help?<br> No, thanks, boys.<br> Got everything under control.<br> Are you a member<br> of this hunting party?<br> I was, but I'm not now.<br> Are they all forgotten men too?<br> Yes, I guess they are, maybe. Why?<br> I couldn't help but laugh. I've wanted<br> to do that since I was six years old.<br> - You wanted to what?<br> - Oh, push Cornelia in a pile of ashes.<br> That was Faithful George with her.<br> That isn't really his name.<br> He gets in everybody's hair.<br> His father's the broker.<br> That's very enlightening.<br> Cornelia thought she was going to win,<br> and you pushed her.<br> Could follow an intelligent conversation<br> for just a moment?<br> - I'll try.<br> - Well, that's fine.<br> Do you mind telling me<br> just what a scavenger hunt is?<br> Well, a scavenger hunt<br> is exactly like a treasure hunt.<br> In a treasure hunt<br> you try to find something you want.<br> In a scavenger hunt you try to find<br> something that nobody wants.<br> - Hmm, like a forgotten man?<br> - That's right.<br> The one that wins gets a prize,<br> only there really is no prize.<br> It's just the honor of winning.<br> The money goes to charity.<br> That is, if there's any money left over,<br> and there never is.<br> Well, that clears<br> the whole matter up beautifully.<br> I've decided I don't want to play any<br> more games with human beings as objects.<br> It's kind of sordid when you think<br> of it, when you think it over.<br> Yeah, well, I don't know.<br> I haven't thought it over.<br> I don't like to change the subject, but<br> why do you live in a place like this?<br> There's so many<br> other nice places.<br> - You really want to know?<br> - Oh, I'm very curious.<br> Because my real estate agent felt the<br> altitude would be good for my asthma.<br> - Oh, my uncle has asthma.<br> - No!<br> Well, now there's a coincidence.<br> Well, I suppose I should<br> be going now, shouldn't I?<br> That's a good idea.<br> I want to see who won the game.<br> I suppose it was Cornelia.<br> She probably got another<br> forgotten man by now.<br> If you took me with you,<br> you'd win the game? Is that the idea?<br> Well, I might if I got there first.<br> But after seeing what you did<br> to Cornelia, I'm not saying anything.<br> But you'd win if you<br> got back first with me?<br> It'd be awfully nice of you,<br> but I don't like to ask.<br> Let's beat Cornelia.<br> - It wouldn't be asking too much?<br> - Mm-mm.<br> See, I've got a sense of curiosity,<br> just the same as you have.<br> I'd really like to see<br> just what a scavenger hunt looks like.<br> - But I told you!<br> - Yes. I'm still curious.<br> Well, come on.<br> Thank you.<br> - My name's Blake.<br> - My name is Bullock.<br> The place slightly resembles<br> an insane asylum.<br> Well, all you need<br> to start an asylum...<br> is an empty room and<br> the right kind of people.<br> That's right.<br> Oh, good evening, Mrs. Jordan.<br> Look what I brought with me.<br> Oh, why, look!<br> - And the baby came along too!<br> - Here.<br> Take a look at the dizzy<br> old gal with the goat.<br> I've had to look at her for 20 years.<br> That's Mrs. Bullock.<br> Alexander!<br> - Alexander! Alexander!<br> - I'm terribly sorry.<br> How do you think I feel?<br> All right, Angelica!<br> Alexander, Alexander, come here.<br> Look at the pretty goat.<br> Carlo and I found him in the Bronx.<br> Isn't he just sweet?<br> - He doesn't smell very sweet.<br> - Oh, Alexander never did like animals.<br> Come on, goat, goat, goat.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> - Are you talking to me or that thing?<br> - Oh, Alexander!<br> Don't be afraid of the stairs. Angelica<br> won't let anything happen to you.<br> Quick, quick, quick.<br> Come on. Quick, quick.<br> Come on, goat, goat, goat.<br> Come on.<br> I have a goat!<br> I have a goat!<br> I have a goat!<br> Will you please<br> pay attention to me?<br> I'm Mrs. Bullock,<br> and I have a goat.<br> I have a goat!<br> I have a goat!<br> I have a goat!<br> I have a goat!<br> I know you've got a goat. Will you<br> please get Mrs. Bullock's goat?<br> Get those things<br> out of the way.<br> I have a little baby goat.<br> What am I supposed<br> to do with that?<br> - What else do we have to find?<br> - What?<br> What else do we have to get?<br> All you have to get is one forgotten man<br> and a bowl ofJapanese goldfish.<br> What? Get that thing<br> out of the way! What?<br> I said, a forgotten man<br> and a bowl ofJapanese goldfish.<br> One man... Let's go.<br> AJapanese man.<br> A man and a bowl<br> ofJapanese men.<br> - I can't remember what he said.<br> - How about going home?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - How about going home?<br> We just have<br> two other things to get.<br> A bowl ofJapanese men<br> and a forgotten goldfish.<br> - Goldfish!<br> - I don't know about the goldfish!<br> But if you want a forgotten man,<br> you'll find me home in bed!<br> I can't concentrate, Alexander.<br> Come along, Carlo. Goldfish...<br> - Are all these people hunters?<br> - Oh, no, we work in groups.<br> Some are hunters,<br> and some are receivers.<br> - Sounds like a bankruptcy proceeding.<br> - I never thought of that.<br> - Who receives me?<br> - I have to take you to the committee.<br> - You don't mind, do you?<br> - I can hardly wait.<br> Wait a minute!<br> What have you there?<br> This is Godfrey.<br> Is Cornelia back yet?<br> I haven't seen Cornelia.<br> Where did you find him?<br> Oh, Mr. Guthrie!<br> Come on this way.<br> Mr. Guthrie!<br> Mr. Guthrie!<br> I have a forgotten man.<br> I have a forgotten man!<br> Mr. Guthrie, this is Godfrey.<br> He's a forgotten man!<br> Mr. Guthrie!<br> - A forgotten man!<br> - His name is Godfrey.<br> - A forgotten man? You got all eight.<br> - Yes.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> please, quiet, quiet.<br> Miss Bullock has a forgotten man.<br> Do you mind stepping up<br> on the platform, please.<br> Yes, get right up<br> on the platform, Godfrey.<br> - Mind if I ask you a few questions?<br> - Fire away.<br> - What is your address?<br> - City Dump 32, East River, Sutton Place.<br> - It's rather fashionable over there.<br> - In spots.<br> - Is that your permanent address?<br> - The permanency is questionable.<br> See, the place is being<br> rapidly filled in.<br> - Mind if I ask a personal question?<br> - If it isn't too personal.<br> - Are those whiskers your own?<br> - No one else has claimed them.<br> I must ask that question<br> because one group...<br> tried to fool the committee by trying to<br> put false whiskers on one of their own.<br> - May I, uh... May I, uh...<br> - What?<br> Oh, it's a pleasure.<br> One more question.<br> Are you wanted by the police?<br> Ah, that's just the trouble.<br> Nobody wants me.<br> - Oh, very good answer.<br> - Splendid, Godfrey.<br> You mean, nobody wants him?<br> Nobody at all?<br> - Nobody.<br> - Oh, that's too bad.<br> On the contrary,<br> I sometimes find it a great advantage.<br> The committee is satisfied.<br> Miss Irene Bullock...<br> wins 20 points<br> for a forgotten man...<br> and 50 points extra<br> for bringing in the first one.<br> - Oh, bravo!<br> - Speech! Speech!<br> Group ten...<br> - Speech! Speech!<br> - Group ten wins the silver cup.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Speech! Speech!<br> - They want a speech. Come on!<br> - Speech!<br> My purpose in coming here<br> tonight was twofold.<br> Firstly, I wanted<br> to aid this young lady.<br> Secondly, I was curious to see...<br> how a bunch empty-headed nitwits<br> conducted themselves.<br> My curiosity is satisfied.<br> I assure you it will be<br> a pleasure for me...<br> to go back to a society<br> of really important people.<br> - What did he call us?<br> - Nitwits.<br> - Nitwits? What are they?<br> - I don't know.<br> The man's perfect!<br> I've been wanting to say that,<br> but I didn't have the nerve.<br> Oh, Godfrey!<br> Oh, Godfrey!<br> Oh, Godfrey,<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> - I'd never brought you here.<br> This is the first time I've ever beaten<br> Cornelia, and you helped me do it.<br> Well, that makes me<br> a Cornelia beater, doesn't it?<br> You've done something for me.<br> I wish I could do something for you.<br> - Why?<br> - Because you've done something for me.<br> No, I don't see. But I could use a job,<br> if you've got one.<br> - Can you "buttle"?<br> - "Buttle"?<br> We're fresh out of butlers.<br> The one we had left this morning.<br> Irene, they're calling for you<br> in the jade room.<br> - Don't you want your cup?<br> - Tell them to keep their cup.<br> You can't talk to this man.<br> What will people think?<br> I don't care what they think.<br> Godfrey's gonna be our butler.<br> - He's gonna be whose butler?<br> - He's gonna work for us.<br> Oh, that's ridiculous.<br> You don't know anything about him.<br> He hasn't any recommendations...<br> The last one had recommendations<br> and stole all the silver.<br> That was merely a coincidence.<br> People that take in stray cats<br> say they make the best pets.<br> I don't see what cats<br> have got to do with butlers.<br> You mustn't pay any attention<br> to my daughter. She's very impulsive.<br> - I'm not impulsive!<br> - Don't shout at your mother.<br> - I will shout!<br> - Oh, Mrs. Meriwether, Irene is shouting.<br> - You mean it's all over?<br> - Yes, she always shouts when she wins.<br> Run along, my good man. Thank you so<br> much for coming. Thank you so, so much.<br> He will not run along!<br> I think I'd better.<br> My word! There's Cornelia,<br> and she has another one!<br> You're a little late, Cornelia.<br> I've won the game.<br> - Oh, you have?<br> - Where do I get my five bucks?<br> Bucks? What...<br> Will you talk to your sister?<br> She wants to hire this man<br> as a butler.<br> Why not? He might make<br> a very good butler.<br> I'm sure I'd make<br> a very good butler.<br> Hey, where do I get<br> my five bucks?<br> Bucks? Bucks? What's he talking<br> about? What's he talking about?<br> - Five bucks!<br> - I promised him five dollars.<br> Well, give him the five dollars and the<br> bucks too, and get him out of here...<br> before your sister<br> hires him as a chauffeur.<br> Why did I have to find out<br> there's insanity on your father's side?<br> Come along, Cornelia.<br> I hope, Godfrey,<br> that you're very good at shining shoes.<br> I think we'd better drop<br> the whole idea, don't you?<br> I should say not. You're gonna make<br> the best butler we ever had.<br> And here. You'll need<br> some clothes and things, you know.<br> Oh, well, I...<br> I told G. To lay out my other coat.<br> You have a wonderful sense of humor.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, then... good night.<br> Oh, uh, just one question.<br> - What?<br> - Where do you live?<br> Oh, 1011 Fifth.<br> Funny, I never thought of that.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> - No.<br> Well, good night again.<br> Good night, Godfrey.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - I'm the new, uh...<br> - Yes, I know. You're the new butler.<br> - How did you know?<br> - There's one every day at this hour.<br> They're dropping in and out<br> all the time.<br> Why is that?<br> Some get fired,<br> some quit.<br> - Is the family that exacting?<br> - No, they're that nutty.<br> - May I be frank?<br> - Is that your name?<br> - No, my name is Godfrey.<br> - All right, be frank.<br> You're, uh,<br> quite an enthusiast.<br> Don't you worry about me.<br> I'm a seasoned campaigner.<br> Uh, may we be friends?<br> Oh, I'm friends<br> with all the butlers. Sit down.<br> What's a three-letter sea bird<br> with an "R" in the middle?<br> That's... Oh, I...<br> I don't know.<br> You're no help.<br> Where'd you get the trick suit?<br> What's the matter with it?<br> Well, it might look better<br> if you took the rental tag off the coat.<br> Oh... thanks.<br> Does the butler have quarters here<br> in the house, or is that necessary?<br> Oh, you won't need any quarters.<br> Hang your hat near the door...<br> so you can get it quickly<br> on the way out.<br> What's that?<br> That's the old battle axe.<br> She usually rings about this time.<br> - The old battle axe?<br> - Mrs. Bullock. She's the mother type.<br> - Well, don't you do anything about it?<br> - Mrs. Bullock or the buzzer?<br> - The buzzer.<br> - Not the first time.<br> If she has a hangover, she'll ring again<br> in a minute in no uncertain terms.<br> Then, brother, you better<br> grab her tomato juice and get going.<br> Ah, there she blows.<br> Well, Cupid, this is<br> your big opportunity.<br> Shall I take it to her?<br> You might as well<br> know the worst.<br> - I want to warn you, she sees pixies.<br> - Pixies?<br> - You know, the little men.<br> - Oh, those.<br> I know how to take care of those.<br> Have you any Worcestershire?<br> What are you<br> gonna do with that?<br> Do unto others as you would<br> have others do unto you.<br> What do you want to do?<br> Scorch her windpipe?<br> There's nothing like a counterirritant.<br> Where do I find her?<br> You better go this way.<br> It's quicker.<br> The upper landing,<br> to the left.<br> - Just which is her...<br> - That's her cage up there, first door.<br> - Oh. Wish me luck.<br> - Happy landing.<br> What day is it, Molly?<br> - I'm not Molly.<br> - Who isn't?<br> I'm not.<br> Stop jumping up and down,<br> so I can see who you are.<br> - I'm not jumping.<br> - That's better.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Godfrey.<br> Are you someone I know?<br> We met last night<br> at the Waldorf Ritz.<br> Oh, yes, you were<br> with Mrs. Maxton's party at the bar.<br> Or were you?<br> I'm the forgotten man.<br> So many people<br> have such bad memories.<br> That's so true.<br> Why do they keep playing<br> that same tune over and over again?<br> Why do they?<br> Don't you hear it?<br> Oh... yes, yes, I do,<br> in a way.<br> Always the same tune<br> over and over again.<br> May I, uh...<br> May you what?<br> Where are you?<br> What's that?<br> Pixie remover.<br> Oh. Then you see them too.<br> We're old friends.<br> Yes, but you mustn't<br> step on them.<br> I don't like them, but I don't like<br> to see them stepped on.<br> I'll be very careful.<br> I wouldn't hurt them for the world.<br> - What am I supposed to do with this?<br> - Drink it.<br> And they'll go away very quickly.<br> Very, very quickly.<br> You must never be rough with them.<br> You must always send them away quietly.<br> - Is that better?<br> - Yes. You're a great help.<br> Go away, little men.<br> Go away. Shh, shh, shh.<br> Oh, but... Oh, you haven't<br> told me who you are.<br> I'm Godfrey, the forgotten man.<br> I'm the new butler.<br> - Are you that ugly man with the beard?<br> - The same.<br> Oh, you've changed.<br> I should never have known you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're very comforting.<br> I hope I'll see more of you.<br> Maybe I'd better not drink any more<br> of this, or you might go away too.<br> I put your hat<br> at the foot of the stairs.<br> You can go out<br> the front way.<br> - I think I won the first round.<br> - You're still working here?<br> - Haven't heard anything to the contrary.<br> - You just got by the cub.<br> - Try the lioness.<br> - Oh, which is she?<br> Her name's Cornelia.<br> She's a sweet-tempered little number.<br> - Yes, I met her last night.<br> - You've got a treat coming.<br> You never met her in the morning.<br> Second door.<br> Who are you,<br> and what are you doing in here?<br> Get out! I don't want<br> a hobo serving my breakfast!<br> Don't ever come here again,<br> if you know what's good for you.<br> I'm afraid I lost<br> the second round.<br> Hey, I want the new butler<br> to bring me breakfast!<br> Opportunity never stops knocking<br> in this house. Want to try again?<br> - How is she in the morning?<br> - Not as violent, but more insidious.<br> Here goes.<br> I'll leave your things right up here,<br> so you won't forget them.<br> Good morning.<br> I brought your breakfast.<br> A- Are you the new butler?<br> - Don't you remember last night?<br> - What happened to Godfrey?<br> - I'm Godfrey.<br> - Oh, you look so different.<br> What happened<br> to those nice whiskers?<br> Turn around.<br> Let me look at you.<br> You're the cutest thing<br> I've ever seen.<br> Thank you.<br> Will there be anything else?<br> Yes. Sit down and talk to me.<br> I like to talk in the morning...<br> especially if you've been<br> somewhere the night before.<br> Don't you think it'd be better<br> if I talked standing?<br> No. If you're uncomfortable,<br> I get uncomfortable,<br> I get uncomfortable and forget<br> what I have to say.<br> If you insist.<br> But it doesn't seem in very<br> good form for a butler.<br> Oh, you're more than a butler.<br> You're the first protege I ever had.<br> - Protege?<br> - You know, like Carlo.<br> - Who is Carlo?<br> - He's Mother's protege!<br> You know, it's awfully nice<br> Carlo having a sponsor,<br> because he doesn't have to work and<br> he gets more time for his practicing.<br> - And that makes a difference.<br> - Yes, I imagine it would.<br> Do you play anything?<br> Oh, I don't mean games.<br> - I mean the piano and things like that.<br> - Well, I...<br> It doesn't really<br> make any difference.<br> It's funny how some things<br> make you think of other things.<br> Yes, very peculiar.<br> - Makes me feel so mature and grown up.<br> - What does?<br> Having a protege.<br> You're the first one I ever had.<br> - You've never had others?<br> - You're the first, and it's thrilling.<br> Not only does it occupy my mind,<br> but it's character-building too.<br> Mm-hmm. Just what<br> does a protege have to do?<br> Well, you just go on buttling,<br> and I sponsor you. Don't you see?<br> Yeah, it's getting clearer.<br> It's really not much work,<br> and it's gonna be such fun.<br> I'm sure it's going<br> to be heaps of fun.<br> For instance, if Cornelia got mean, you<br> wouldn't have to do anything about it.<br> I'm your sponsor,<br> and I'd just take a sock at her.<br> I hope that'll<br> never be necessary.<br> I just wanted<br> to give you the idea.<br> That's fine, but a protege<br> has certain responsibilities also.<br> For instance, if someone should ring<br> for me now and I didn't answer,<br> that would reflect upon you<br> because you're my sponsor.<br> - Don't you see?<br> - Yes, I never thought of that.<br> You don't know how nice it is having<br> some intelligent person to talk to.<br> It's been very enlightening<br> to me too.<br> Oh, I just thought of something.<br> Do you know what you are?<br> - I'm not quite sure.<br> - You're my responsibility.<br> - That's very nice.<br> - See you in church.<br> Good morning.<br> Fine morning, sir.<br> Yes, it is a fine morning.<br> Don't be in a hurry.<br> You see,<br> I'm the old-fashioned type.<br> And I was also middleweight champion<br> when I was in college.<br> I thought you might like to know that<br> before this thing starts.<br> Well, you see, sir,<br> I'm the new butler.<br> I just served Miss Irene<br> her breakfast.<br> Do you always take a change of wardrobe<br> when you serve breakfast?<br> Well... I think<br> this young lady can explain.<br> He really is the new butler,<br> Mr. Bullock.<br> I can't imagine how his things<br> got in the hallway.<br> I still don't get it. But if you are<br> the new butler, why didn't you say so?<br> I'm very sorry, sir.<br> May I?<br> There's a man at the door to see you.<br> I think it's another process server.<br> - Another one?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Well, here I am again<br> with another little present...<br> Yes, I've heard that before. Which one<br> of the family is it this time?<br> Miss Cornelia. Last night, she busted<br> up a few windows along Fifth Avenue.<br> - I'm sorry, but girls will be girls.<br> - Good-bye.<br> In this family,<br> it's one subpoena after another.<br> Mr. Bullock, there's a handsome<br> cab driver waiting in the kitchen.<br> - What's he want?<br> - He wants $50 and his horse.<br> What horse?<br> The one Miss Irene rode<br> up the front steps last night.<br> Where is his horse?<br> I haven't got it.<br> It's in the library,<br> where Miss Irene left it.<br> Well, do you begin<br> to get the idea?<br> Come here, my man.<br> Do you like your place here,<br> so far as you've gone?<br> I find it very entertaining.<br> Yes, we are a very<br> entertaining family.<br> You really think you're<br> going to like it here?<br> I must admit it's more desirable than<br> living in a packing case on a city dump.<br> Oh, that's where I met you,<br> isn't it?<br> - Yes, miss.<br> - Oh, yes, yes. I remember now.<br> We were playing some sort of a game...<br> a scavenger hunt, I think.<br> We needed a forgotten man. I asked you<br> to go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,<br> and I'm a little bit hazy as to<br> just what happened after that.<br> - I pushed you into an ash pile.<br> - Oh, yes, of course you did.<br> It was very amusing.<br> They were nice, clean ashes.<br> - I'm very sorry, miss.<br> - I didn't mind at all.<br> It was very amusing.<br> Have you a handkerchief?<br> There's a spot on my shoe.<br> Would you see what you can do about it?<br> I could have you fired, you know?<br> But I like to see things wriggle.<br> When I get through with you,<br> you'll go back to your packing case<br> on the city dump and relish it.<br> People don't make a practice of pushing<br> Cornelia Bullock into ash piles.<br> I'll make your life so miser...<br> - Hello, Godfrey.<br> - Greetings, Irene.<br> - I like your new monkey suit.<br> - Thank you for picking it up.<br> - It fits very well for a hand-me-down.<br> - I'm more or less standard.<br> How do you like<br> my new pajamas?<br> I think they're very nice.<br> Thank you.<br> - I heard what you said to Godfrey.<br> - So what?<br> - So you leave him alone!<br> - Who's gonna make me leave him alone?<br> If you don't,<br> you'll get a good sock from me.<br> - Oh, the physical type.<br> - What I say goes.<br> Since when did you start<br> falling in love with butlers?<br> I'm not in love with him.<br> He's my protege.<br> Oh, your protege. That's why<br> you're picking out his suits for him.<br> Suppose Father hears about this. How<br> long do you think Godfrey will last?<br> Father isn't<br> going to hear about it.<br> You seem terribly sure<br> of everything.<br> If Father hears about Godfrey,<br> he's also going to hear about you<br> and that college boy.<br> I don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> But if Father does hear about it, I'm<br> likely to do a little socking myself.<br> Little Red Riding Hood didn't have<br> enough charm to trap a wolf her own age,<br> so she falls in love with the butler<br> and lives happily ever after.<br> - If you know what I mean.<br> - I know, if you know what I mean.<br> - May I come in?<br> - You're in, aren't you?<br> Very interesting book.<br> The Greeks of the Middle Ages.<br> Oh, Irene would like that. You love<br> the Middle Ages, don't you, dear?<br> Ahh.<br> Oh, Carlo!<br> Who's giving the concert tonight?<br> - The great Kalininski.<br> - Oh, the pianist?<br> - No, cellist.<br> - What difference does it make?<br> Oh, it's so nice to see you two girls<br> having a pleasant chat.<br> Or is it a pleasant chat?<br> Well, well, well! Imagine the Bullocks<br> gathered together in one room.<br> - Don't forget Carlo.<br> - I'm not going to forget Carlo.<br> Don't bother about me.<br> I feel like one of the family.<br> Don't you go away.<br> You don't mind if I discuss a few family<br> matters, do you, Carlo, old boy?<br> - No, not at all.<br> - Oh, Alexander,<br> you're not going to bring up those<br> sordid business matters, I hope.<br> I've just been going over<br> last month's bills,<br> and you people have confused me<br> with the Treasury Department.<br> Don't start that again, Dad.<br> I don't mind giving the government<br> But I can't do it<br> when my family spends 50%!<br> Well, why should the government<br> get more money than your own family?<br> That's what I want to know.<br> Why should the government get more?<br> Well, that's just the way<br> they have of doing things.<br> Oh! Money, money, money!<br> The Frankenstein monster<br> that destroys souls!<br> Please don't say anything more<br> about it! You're upsetting Carlo!<br> We've got to come<br> to an understanding right now!<br> - Either Carlo is or I am.<br> - Am what?<br> Well, one of us has got to,<br> and that's all there is to it.<br> You're inebriated. You don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> Who would know what they're talking<br> about, living with a bunch like this?<br> There's one thing I do know.<br> What this family needs is discipline.<br> I've been a pretty patient man.<br> But when people start riding<br> horses up the front steps...<br> and parking them in the library,<br> that's going a bit too far.<br> - Horses?<br> - Are you insinuating I rode a horse?<br> Maybe that wasn't a horse<br> I saw in the library.<br> I'm positive I didn't ride a horse.<br> I didn't have my riding costume on.<br> - Irene rode the horse up the steps.<br> - What horse?<br> Don't play innocent.<br> I begged you not to do it.<br> I didn't ride a horse!<br> But if I did ride a horse,<br> who broke those windows<br> on Fifth Avenue?<br> - What windows?<br> - You know what windows!<br> And how about that college sap?<br> Yah, yah, yah!<br> I don't care who broke the horse,<br> rode the window or yah, yah, yah'ed.<br> But this family's got to settle down!<br> Will you stop bellowing!<br> Look what you're doing to Carlo.<br> - Hang Carlo!<br> - Ohhh!<br> You've exhausted my patience!<br> - Did you make these?<br> - I helped.<br> - They must be wonderful.<br> - I'd like to help, if you'll let me.<br> - I'd feel honored.<br> You might as well face the situation.<br> I've lost a lot of money.<br> - You have?<br> - Yes, I have.<br> Maybe you left it<br> in your other suit.<br> If things keep on, it won't be long<br> till I don't have another suit.<br> Which ones are poisoned?<br> Thank you.<br> While we're on the subject, how about<br> this business of certain people...<br> picking up anybody they find on the city<br> dump and dragging them into the house?<br> - We might all be stabbed and robbed.<br> - Who's going to stab who?<br> We don't know a thing<br> about certain people.<br> Someone should speak to Irene<br> about picking up strays.<br> - What's a stray?<br> - You shut up!<br> - Me?<br> - No. Cornelia.<br> I will not shut up.<br> My life is precious to me.<br> - It won't be in a minute.<br> - Now, now, children.<br> Come, Carlo. Come and get<br> some nice hors d'oeuvre.<br> I think we should get our help<br> from employment agencies.<br> I don't know<br> but I agree with Cornelia.<br> What are you all talking about?<br> You upset Carlo,<br> and now you're upsetting Irene.<br> Don't you remember her<br> breakdown last summer?<br> I certainly do. That's why I'm not<br> paying any attention to this.<br> If Mother can sponsor Carlo,<br> why can't I sponsor Godfrey?<br> Godfrey knows I'm not being personal,<br> but none of us would like to wake up<br> some morning stabbed to death.<br> You mustn't<br> come between Irene and Godfrey.<br> He's the first thing she's shown any<br> affection for since her Pomeranian died.<br> Now, now, Irene.<br> You mustn't have a spell.<br> Carlo, quick, quick,<br> give me a sofa cushion. Here.<br> Come, darling, lift up<br> your head like a good girl.<br> There now, darling, don't cry.<br> Now, now, darling.<br> She's not having a spell.<br> That's old stuff.<br> Darling.<br> - What is all this nonsense?<br> - Will you be quiet!<br> You never did understand them.<br> Why don't you get a doctor?<br> - I don't want a doctor!<br> - Do you want an ice bag?<br> - I want to die!<br> - You mustn't do that.<br> She makes me ill.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Carlo, do the gorilla for Irene.<br> It always amuses her.<br> - I'm not in the mood.<br> - Stop eating and get in the mood.<br> - Here.<br> - All right.<br> I'll do it,<br> but my heart won't be in it.<br> Irene, be a good girl<br> and sit up and look at Carlo.<br> You know it always amuses you.<br> Come on, quick.<br> Go ahead, go ahead!<br> Go on, Carlo. Quickly.<br> Look, Irene! Look at Carlo!<br> Isn't that lovely?<br> Oh, isn't that clever, Irene? Look!<br> Carlo, come down.<br> She can see you better.<br> She's starting to laugh.<br> Isn't he clever?<br> Carlo, come down<br> where Irene can see you.<br> She's starting to laugh.<br> Isn't that funny?<br> Oh, he's on the door. Look! Look!<br> He frightens me!<br> No, darling, you mustn't be frightened.<br> He's just playing.<br> Darling, look at Carlo.<br> - Look, darling, look. Isn't he clever?<br> - No!<br> Why don't you stop imitating<br> a gorilla and imitate a man?<br> You wouldn't know an artist<br> if one came up and bit you!<br> This family<br> doesn't need any stimulant.<br> I'll be in my room.<br> You can repeat this order in 30 minutes.<br> Someday I'm going gorilla<br> hunting, and I won't miss.<br> Has Cornelia gone?<br> Yes, darling, she's gone.<br> - Where's Godfrey?<br> - He's here. Don't go away, Godfrey.<br> We'll be late<br> for the concert.<br> I'll be right with you.<br> Godfrey's right here.<br> Godfrey, come over here<br> so Irene can look at you.<br> - Here's Godfrey, darling.<br> - Where?<br> Right here. Look. Say hello<br> to Irene so she'll know who you are.<br> - Hello.<br> - Oh, hello, Godfrey.<br> And he's promised to stay on.<br> Haven't you, Godfrey?<br> - If I'm wanted.<br> - Of course you're wanted, isn't he?<br> - Yes. Go away.<br> - I'm going. Take good care of her.<br> Yes, Carlo, I'm coming.<br> Good-bye, darling, good-bye.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I'm sorry,<br> but I didn't quite hear...<br> I said, I'm not really<br> having a spell.<br> Hey, cook, you'd better<br> put this back on the fire.<br> Looks like we've lost<br> most of our customers.<br> Well, what's the matter, handsome?<br> Did something frighten you?<br> What kind of family<br> am I up against?<br> There are some things<br> even I can't answer.<br> Do they go on this way<br> all the time?<br> - Oh, no! This is just a quiet evening.<br> - Quiet evening?<br> If I were you, I'd<br> get rid of that lip rouge.<br> Makes you look<br> a little like Cupid.<br> You'll find Godfrey<br> in his room.<br> How did you know<br> I want to see Godfrey?<br> I don't know.<br> It just came over me.<br> Oh, you...<br> you can't come in here.<br> Why not?<br> It's our house, isn't it?<br> One room is just<br> like any other room.<br> Besides, I want to talk.<br> I'm terribly sorry,<br> but we can't talk here.<br> Don't you think it's indecent of you<br> to order me out after you kissed me?<br> After I kissed you,<br> did you say?<br> Isn't it funny? This morning you were<br> sitting on my bed; now I'm on yours.<br> We'll overlook<br> that startling coincidence.<br> - Uh, will you sit over here, please?<br> - The bed's comfortable.<br> - If it isn't, I'll get you another.<br> - We'll have our talk here.<br> If you want a new bed,<br> you can have it.<br> Uh, the bed's<br> very comfortable, thank you.<br> Much more so<br> than I am at the moment.<br> Any time you're uncomfortable,<br> you just let me know.<br> Thank you. Hasn't anyone ever told you<br> about certain proprieties?<br> You use such lovely big words.<br> I like big words. What does it mean?<br> I'll try to simplify it.<br> Hasn't your mother or anyone<br> ever explained to you...<br> that some things are proper<br> and some things are not?<br> She rambles on quite a bit,<br> but she never says anything.<br> - But you want me to remain, don't you?<br> - Oh, of course!<br> And I want to justify your faith in me<br> by being a very good butler...<br> and filling the void created by the<br> death of your late, lamented Pomeranian.<br> Oh, I've forgotten about him.<br> He had fleas, anyway.<br> Besides, you're different. You use<br> big words, and you're much cuter.<br> - May I tell you a story?<br> - I'd love it.<br> Once there was very sentimental<br> little girl with a very kind heart,<br> and she helped a man<br> who was very grateful.<br> Then she became a nuisance and undid<br> all the fine work she had done.<br> - Is it someone you know?<br> - Her name is Irene Bullock.<br> If she was a smart girl, she'd pick out<br> some nice chap in her own social set...<br> and marry him and<br> live happily ever after...<br> and never, never enter<br> the butler's room again.<br> - I never can come in here again?<br> - Never.<br> - When can we talk?<br> - When I'm serving breakfast,<br> I can say good morning and<br> you can say good morning.<br> - But you must never come into my room.<br> - You'll be sorry!<br> - I'm only trying to be helpful.<br> - You're being mean!<br> I'll do something!<br> You wait and see! You'll be sorry!<br> You'll be sorry!<br> #Ochi Chornie #<br> #Ochi Chornie #<br> #Ochi Chornie #<br> #Ochi Chornie #<br> That's a very pretty tune.<br> What's the name of it?<br> #Ochi Chornie #<br> Oh, that's the name too.<br> I thought it was just the words.<br> I like it because<br> the words are all the same.<br> That's probably why "The Star<br> Spangled Banner" is so confusing.<br> Nobody seems to know the words.<br> Except, perhaps, Godfrey.<br> He seems to know everything.<br> - Do you know the words?<br> - The words?<br> Yes, yes. "The Star Spangled Banner. "<br> Nobody seems to know the words.<br> Do you know them, Godfrey?<br> I suppose I know as many<br> as the average person.<br> I feel ashamed of myself.<br> I should know them all.<br> After all, my ancestors<br> came over on the boat.<br> Not the Mayflower,<br> but the boat after that.<br> What did your ancestors<br> come over on, Godfrey?<br> As far as I know,<br> they've always been here.<br> They weren't Indians,<br> I hope.<br> One can never be sure<br> of one's ancestors...<br> You know, you have<br> rather high cheekbones.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> These flowers came for Irene.<br> Where shall I put them?<br> Well, ask her.<br> There she is now.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Psst, Carlo.<br> Did you notice his cheekbones?<br> These flowers just came for you, miss.<br> Where shall I put them?<br> What difference does it make<br> when one's heart is breaking?<br> Yes, miss.<br> Shall I put them on the piano?<br> Life is but an empty bubble.<br> You don't sound very cheerful<br> for a girl who's giving a tea party.<br> Why should anyone<br> be cheerful?<br> Oh, is Irene<br> giving a tea party?<br> - You're not invited.<br> - I'll invite myself.<br> - Let's stick around, George.<br> - Sure. Why not?<br> All I have to say is,<br> some people will be sorry someday.<br> - Naturally, everybody will be someday.<br> - For what?<br> Some people will know for what,<br> and then it will be too late.<br> This conversation<br> is very confusing.<br> Now, now, Irene.<br> You mustn't confuse Carlo.<br> He's practicing.<br> Do you know any good<br> funeral music, Carlo?<br> Shut up!<br> Are you acting<br> for anybody in particular?<br> Godfrey might be interested, if<br> he'd only turn around and look.<br> Oh, I remember<br> that pose so well.<br> - I learned in dramatic school. Eight?<br> - Yeah, that's number eight.<br> Am I spoiling your act, dear?<br> I'll spoil something of yours someday,<br> and it won't be your act.<br> Do you suppose Miss Irene would<br> like sandwiches served in here,<br> or shall I create<br> a sort of buffet?<br> Where do you want<br> the sandwiches served?<br> - What is food?<br> - Something you eat, silly.<br> Do you want the sandwiches<br> served in here, or don't you?<br> What difference does it make?<br> Some people do as they like...<br> with other people's lives,<br> and it doesn't make any difference.<br> - What did I call?<br> - Five, hearts.<br> Was it hearts?<br> I meant spades.<br> I can't change, can I?<br> That music has me so confused.<br> Carlo, please!<br> Hi, Irene.<br> Why the shroud?<br> Listen, Van Rumple, just because<br> some people have a million dollars...<br> doesn't mean they can put<br> their arms around other people.<br> Brrr!<br> Where's the bar?<br> Don't take her seriously. The servant<br> problem's been bothering her lately.<br> No, thank you.<br> I'm not hungry.<br> No, thank you.<br> - Four, clubs.<br> - Oh, just a minute, Godfrey. Uh, bye.<br> - Hello, everybody!<br> - Hello, Tommy.<br> - Oh, Tommy Gray!<br> - Hello there.<br> What's the matter with you,<br> Godfrey? Are you ill?<br> Come along, Tommy,<br> and give Angelica a hug.<br> How's everything in Boston?<br> All the beans and things?<br> We're rounding them up<br> and putting them in cans.<br> - How are you, darling?<br> - What does it matter how I am?<br> - The whole thing is only a delusion.<br> - What thing?<br> - You wouldn't understand.<br> - Well, I don't so far.<br> I'm famished.<br> How about something to eat?<br> Oh, Godfrey,<br> bring Mr. Gray a sandwich.<br> It's your play. Well, come around here<br> Mr. Gray's not an acrobat.<br> What's come over you? You're beginning<br> to act like the rest of the family.<br> - Hey, wait a minute!<br> - What's the trouble?<br> Godfrey Parke, you old mug!<br> - Oh, do you know Godfrey?<br> - We went to Harvard together.<br> I'm afraid you've confused me with<br> someone else. I'm Smith, remember?<br> Sure, you're Smith.<br> We did go to college together?<br> - Or did we?<br> - A butler with a college education.<br> - He's not really the butler?<br> - And a very good one.<br> You mean, this is not a gag<br> just for my benefit?<br> Mr. Gray neglected to tell you that when<br> we were in Harvard, I was his valet.<br> - Was he a good servant, Tommy?<br> - Excellent.<br> - What's the idea?<br> - I'll tell you later.<br> - Mr. Gray never complained.<br> - When?<br> No, I had very few complaints<br> about Godfrey's work.<br> I'll tell you tomorrow.<br> It's my day off.<br> Strange, you never gave<br> Mr. Gray as a reference.<br> You see, I left Mr. Gray under<br> very unusual circumstances.<br> - What circumstances?<br> - I'd rather Mr. Gray told you.<br> Well, don't go away.<br> Come here and tell us all about it.<br> Godfrey's a very mysterious person.<br> Nobody seems to know about him.<br> - Don't go away, Godfrey.<br> - No, no, don't go away, Godfrey.<br> You see, I didn't want to say<br> anything about this.<br> But, you see, Godfrey had been working<br> for us as a butler and whatnot,<br> and things had been<br> going along very well...<br> when all of a sudden it happened...<br> just like that.<br> You're sure you want me<br> to tell all this, Godfrey?<br> Well, you see, as I said,<br> he'd been working for us for some time,<br> when one day he came to me and said,<br> "Mr. Gray, I trust my work<br> has always been satisfactory. "<br> I said, "Why, of course. I've never had<br> more satisfactory work in all my life. "<br> And he said,<br> "Thank you, Mr. Gray. "<br> He was always<br> a very courteous man, Godfrey.<br> Godfrey is still extremely courteous,<br> especially in the morning.<br> Well, it's not much of a story.<br> Maybe we'd better skip it.<br> Come on, Tommy, finish it.<br> You can't stop in the middle.<br> - Where was I?<br> - Telling us how polite Godfrey was.<br> And that's where I said that<br> Godfrey was still very polite.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Bullock. It's<br> a pleasure to have you say so publicly.<br> That's my nature. I never say anything<br> behind your back I won't say in public.<br> That's what I admire<br> about you, Angelica.<br> That's nice of you, Tommy.<br> What about the story?<br> Well, anyway, Godfrey said, "I trust<br> my work has been satisfactory, sir. "<br> That was about the gist of it,<br> wasn't it, Godfrey?<br> Those may not have been my exact words,<br> sir, but that was about the gist of it.<br> We'll settle for that.<br> You said he was very satisfactory.<br> He said thank you,<br> and then what?<br> - I had to take an attitude.<br> - What kind of an attitude?<br> Well, the only kind I could take<br> toward a faithful servant.<br> But Godfrey decided in favor<br> of his wife and five children.<br> - Five children? My, my!<br> - Five.<br> Tsk, tsk, tsk. Was his wife<br> an Indian woman?<br> She was rather dark. We used to take<br> her on hunting trips to stalk the game.<br> Godfrey! Why didn't you tell me<br> you had five children?<br> Why shouldn't Godfrey<br> have five children?<br> If a woman in Canada can have five<br> children, why can't Godfrey? You see?<br> I owe the creation of my family<br> to Mr. Gray's generosity.<br> Well, if other people can have<br> five children, so can other people.<br> Personally, I think two are plenty,<br> and Bullock agrees with me.<br> Listen, everybody, I want<br> to make an announcement about something.<br> What do you want<br> to announce?<br> - I'm going to be married.<br> - Married? To whom?<br> - Well, you'll find out soon enough.<br> - Not Charlie Van Rumple?<br> - Yes, Charlie Van Rumple. Where is he?<br> - He's at the bar.<br> I've had my arm around her before,<br> but this is the first time<br> I ever felt that chill.<br> - Congratulations, old boy.<br> - Congratulations about what?<br> - Your engagement, you slug.<br> - What engagement?<br> Why, you're engaged<br> to Irene, aren't you?<br> - Am I?<br> - Don't be ga-ga! Come on!<br> - I hear we're engaged.<br> - You said it.<br> - When did it happen?<br> - Just now.<br> - What's all the excitement?<br> - I think she's got herself engaged.<br> Oh, has she again? It must<br> be that nice boy in the brown suit.<br> Let's go and congratulate them.<br> You're a lucky boy.<br> I know I am.<br> I'm not Van Rumple.<br> - Oh, you're not? Which one is he?<br> - There he is.<br> You'll pardon me, I hope.<br> - You're Van Rumple, aren't you?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Oh, you'll take good care of her.<br> - I imagine so.<br> My mind's a little cloudy.<br> I don't even remember proposing.<br> You're always proposing.<br> - Which one did you take me up on?<br> - All of them.<br> How do you think Godfrey'll<br> feel about your engagement?<br> - What has Godfrey got to do with it?<br> - I wonder.<br> - You mind your own business.<br> - All right, let's have those.<br> - Come on, everybody.<br> - Are you going to congratulate Irene?<br> - She just got herself engaged.<br> - I'd be very happy to.<br> Godfrey, come congratulate Irene.<br> May I congratulate you, Miss Irene?<br> I wish you all<br> the happiness in the world.<br> Just leave her alone.<br> She'll be all right in a minute.<br> - Is she mad at me?<br> - She's not mad at anybody.<br> Women always cry at their own<br> engagements and other people's weddings.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know why, but they just do.<br> Irene is so peculiar. She shouts when<br> she weeps and cries when she's happy.<br> - Alexander, you missed the excitement.<br> - What's going on?<br> I knew what I wanted to say,<br> but somehow it slipped my mind.<br> - What's the matter with Irene?<br> - Oh, yes, that's it!<br> - Irene's got engaged.<br> - To whom?<br> Van something or other. I think he's<br> that boy with his arm around that girl.<br> - He's got lots of money.<br> - He'll need it.<br> Godfrey, let's you and I<br> have a good cry.<br> How about lunch<br> by my hotel tomorrow?<br> Yes, sir. Do you prefer<br> soda or ginger ale?<br> - Both. 12:00?<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Make up your mind just who she's going<br> to marry. I'd like to meet the guy.<br> I don't know, Alexander.<br> It's one of those boys in there.<br> Come along, now.<br> You're not eating well<br> this morning, sir.<br> - You notice everything.<br> - Business trouble, sir?<br> What made you ask that?<br> Well, sir, butlers can't help picking<br> up scraps of news, shall we say?<br> We shan't say<br> anything about it.<br> I thought I might be<br> of some help, sir.<br> I dabbled in the market<br> at one time.<br> One dabbler in the family<br> is quite enough.<br> - Very good, sir. Your eggs.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Godfrey, you seem to be<br> a pretty good sort.<br> Have you noticed anything queer<br> about me lately?<br> Nothing particularly, sir.<br> I sometimes wonder whether my whole<br> family's gone mad or whether it's me.<br> I know how you feel. I've felt that<br> way many times since I've been here.<br> Then why do you stay here?<br> I have to; you don't.<br> It's much more comfortable than living<br> in a packing box on the city dump, sir.<br> Besides, I'm rather proud<br> of my job here.<br> - You're proud of being a butler?<br> - Proud of being a good butler.<br> And I may add, sir, a butler<br> has to be good to hold his job here.<br> Say... who are you?<br> I'm just a nobody, sir.<br> Coffee?<br> Godfrey, here I am.<br> So you've turned up at last, eh?<br> I began to think<br> you had fallen down the kitchen sink.<br> Sorry I'm late, Tommy.<br> It's hard to make beds full of people.<br> Waiter! You seem to do everything<br> except put out the cat.<br> I suppose I'd do that too,<br> only we have no cat.<br> The same for me.<br> What will you have, Jarvis, my man?<br> Make it a rousing<br> old lemonade.<br> Lemonade? You sure<br> you can handle it?<br> Oh, yes, I'm the type who<br> can take it or leave it alone.<br> You see, now that I'm a working man,<br> I have to keep my wits about me.<br> I'm beginning to wonder if you've got<br> any left. Don't avoid the issue.<br> I've been sitting here<br> like a snoopy old maid...<br> with her ears flapping in the breeze,<br> waiting to hear the dirt.<br> What dirt<br> would you like to hear?<br> Well, when I see one of the Parkes<br> of Boston serving hors d'oeuvre...<br> I think I'm entitled<br> to a pardonable curiosity.<br> Why tell you something<br> that you won't understand?<br> You've fallen off so many polo ponies<br> that your brain is scrambled.<br> But I still want to know<br> why you're buttling,<br> when your family is telling everybody<br> that you're in South America.<br> A family has to say something<br> to save its face.<br> The Parkes disgrace<br> very easily.<br> I'd like to see their faces when they<br> find out that you're a butler.<br> - They're not going to find it out.<br> - Come to the point.<br> Well, there isn't<br> much of a point.<br> Do you remember that little<br> incident up in Boston?<br> You still have that woman<br> on your mind?<br> No, not anymore.<br> But I was pretty bitter at the time.<br> So I gave her everything I had<br> and just disappeared.<br> You know, the Parkes were<br> never educated to face life.<br> - We've been puppets for ten generations.<br> - And?<br> Tommy, it's surprising<br> how fast you can go downhill...<br> when you begin<br> to feel sorry for yourself.<br> And boy did I feel sorry<br> for myself!<br> I wandered down<br> to the East River one night,<br> thinking I'd just slide in<br> and get it over with.<br> But I met some fellows<br> living there, on a city dump.<br> They were people who were fighting<br> it out and not complaining.<br> I never got<br> as far as the river.<br> Would you do me<br> a big favor?<br> - Who do you want killed?<br> - I'll do my own killing.<br> Go around the corner and telephone<br> this place and ask for Tommy Gray.<br> When you get him on the wire,<br> keep him there.<br> - What's this all about?<br> - Don't ask too many questions.<br> Okay.<br> And so out of the ruins<br> of Godfrey Parke...<br> a new edifice has sprung up<br> in the form of Godfrey Smith.<br> And, I may add, the edifice<br> is going to keep on springing.<br> Do you intend<br> to remain a butler?<br> No, I have<br> some other ideas in mind.<br> But you wouldn't understand<br> those either, so we won't go into that.<br> - Will you do me a favor?<br> - Maybe.<br> I have a friend in town,<br> a very eminent brain specialist.<br> I'd like him<br> to examine you.<br> I'll submit to an examination,<br> if you will also.<br> That's a bet.<br> - Are you Mr. Gray?<br> - Yes.<br> - You're wanted on the phone.<br> - On the phone? What the...<br> Back in a minute, Godfrey.<br> - Well, the mystery's solved.<br> - The mystery?<br> Yes. Now I know what<br> a butler does on his day off.<br> When you worked for Mr. Gray,<br> were the two of you always this chummy?<br> You see, I worked for Mr. Gray<br> a long time, and we got to be...<br> Yeah, that was under<br> the name of Smith, wasn't it?<br> Or did I hear him mention<br> the name of Parke?<br> He may have said that we used to take<br> long walks in the park.<br> - A sort of custom.<br> - Oh, yes, I see.<br> Well, if you can be so chummy<br> with the Grays,<br> why can't you be chummy<br> with the Bullocks?<br> - I try to keep my place.<br> - Why? You're very attractive.<br> - As a butler?<br> - No, as a Smith.<br> - You're a rotten butler.<br> - Sorry.<br> Are we going to be friends?<br> I feel that on my day off, I should have<br> the privilege of choosing my friends.<br> You can't go on like this forever.<br> You really like me, and you're<br> afraid to admit it, aren't you?<br> Do you want me to tell you<br> what I really think of you?<br> - Please do.<br> - As Smith or as a butler?<br> - Choose your own weapon.<br> - You won't hold it against me?<br> - It's your day off.<br> - Very well.<br> You belong to that<br> unfortunate category...<br> that I would call<br> the Park Avenue brat.<br> A spoiled child who's<br> grown up in ease and luxury,<br> who's always<br> had her own way,<br> and whose misdirected<br> energies are so childish...<br> that they hardly deserve the comment<br> even of a butler on his offThursday.<br> Thank you for a very lovely portrait.<br> Hiya, Cornelia.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Godfrey and I were discussing<br> tomorrow's menu.<br> - Well, don't run away.<br> - I'm in an awfully big hurry. Good-bye.<br> I'll see you<br> down by the ash pile.<br> - What did she mean by that?<br> - A little joke we have between us.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Ajoking butler.<br> What's the matter<br> with that stuff?<br> I think I'll switch.<br> I'm more at mood.<br> Now we're getting<br> someplace. Waiter!<br> Another one of these.<br> - He's not back yet, is he?<br> - Not yet.<br> Would you mind putting these<br> flowers in his room?<br> - I can't go in there anymore.<br> - I can't, either.<br> - You won't tell him they're from me?<br> - If you don't want me to.<br> Oh, I don't want him<br> to know.<br> It's his, isn't it?<br> - Do you always sew his buttons on?<br> - Sometimes.<br> I'd like to sew his buttons on<br> sometime when they come off.<br> - I wouldn't mind at all.<br> - He doesn't lose very many.<br> - Oh, he's very tidy...<br> - Yes, he's very tidy.<br> - What does he do on his day off?<br> - He never tells me.<br> He's probably sitting somewhere<br> with some woman on his lap.<br> He's the meanest man I know.<br> I think he's very mean.<br> I suppose he's sitting<br> somewhere with somebody on his lap...<br> who doesn't care for him at all.<br> As far as I know, maybe his children<br> are there too, calling him, calling him.<br> Oh, I can't bear it.<br> Please don't.<br> You too?<br> Oh, Molly, I know<br> exactly how you feel.<br> Good evening.<br> How about a quartet?<br> Ehh!<br> # For tomorrow may bring sorrow #<br> # So tonight let us be gay #<br> "'Courage,' she said,<br> and pointed toward the land.<br> "'This wave will roll ashore<br> but soon. '<br> "And the afternoon<br> came into a land...<br> into which it seemed<br> always afternoon. "<br> "All around the coast<br> the languid air did swoon. "<br> - What's the matter, darling?<br> - Nothing.<br> - She's been eating onions.<br> - Onions make me sleepy.<br> Irene loves onions.<br> When she was a little girl,<br> she was always stealing<br> onions from the icebox.<br> You know, sometimes<br> I wonder if my children are all there.<br> "Like a downward smoke,<br> the slender stream along the cliff...<br> did fall and fall<br> and fall to the sea. "<br> Evening.<br> I thought I told you to send that<br> gray satin evening dress to the cleaner.<br> - Gray satin?<br> - Why can't you do as you're told?<br> With pleasure.<br> Seems to me that every time you pick up<br> a paper, somebody's been murdered.<br> Imagine a man drowning<br> his wife in a bathtub.<br> Maybe it's the only way<br> he could get her to take a bath.<br> Well, if anyone ever drowned<br> my Duke in their bathtub,<br> his mama would be<br> very sad, she would.<br> Will there be<br> anything else, madam?<br> I haven't asked for anything, so I don't<br> see how I could want anything.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> I thought you were Miss Cornelia.<br> You thought<br> I was Cornelia?<br> Forgive me, but you seem to be looking<br> younger every day, if I may say so.<br> You certainly may. Thank you very much.<br> Did you send Godfrey<br> upstairs for anything?<br> Did I? No, I'm quite sure I didn't.<br> Why?<br> I just wondered.<br> I was in the Kerry Bar today.<br> That place is getting run down.<br> They're catering<br> to a very low class of people.<br> You shouldn't<br> go in there, my dear.<br> Darling, what's the matter?<br> You're not eating anything.<br> Nobody cares<br> if I starve myself to death.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> I don't mind dying,<br> if other people don't.<br> She's in love.<br> Haven't you heard?<br> It's probably her engagement. Several<br> of my girlfriends acted just like that.<br> - Maybe her stomach is upset.<br> - Nobody asked you!<br> There goes the profits.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> I don't know what's the matter with<br> Godfrey. He's been acting so peculiar.<br> But he did pay me<br> a nice compliment.<br> He's always paying<br> other people compliments.<br> Why don't you eat? Look at Carlo.<br> He's had two helpings of everything.<br> Leave her alone. Carlo's eating<br> enough for both of them.<br> He ought to be strong enough<br> soon to give that concert.<br> You can't rush genius.<br> He could give a bang-up concert<br> right now with a knife and fork.<br> Why do you always pick on Carlo?<br> Why not try someone else for a change?<br> Wait a minute, Mother. Come here, Dad.<br> Something terrible has happened.<br> What is it?<br> What's happened?<br> You look frightened.<br> You're as white as a sheet.<br> Let's go into the living room,<br> where we won't be overheard.<br> Cornelia, what is it?<br> Are you ill?<br> Come, come, sit down here.<br> Let me get you an aspirin or something.<br> - I'm all right.<br> - What's troubling you?<br> Do you remember the pearl necklace<br> I got for my birthday?<br> - Why, yes!<br> - What about it?<br> - It's disappeared.<br> - Maybe somebody stole it.<br> Will you fill your gob<br> and keep out of this!<br> - I was only trying to help.<br> - We don't need your help.<br> - When did you find out?<br> - I put it on my dressing table.<br> I went upstairs just now,<br> and it was gone.<br> - And it cost such a lot of money.<br> - I'll say it did.<br> - What are we going to do?<br> - I'll go call the police.<br> Never mind, Dad.<br> I've already called them.<br> Oh!<br> Mm-mm. Well, what I want to know is,<br> when did you miss the pearls?<br> During dinner I went to my room,<br> and they were gone.<br> - She's always leaving them.<br> - Nobody asked you anything.<br> If you're going to be rude to my<br> daughter, you might take your hats off.<br> When we're on criminal cases,<br> lady, we keep both hands free.<br> You mean to imply<br> that I'm a criminal?<br> All I know is<br> that it's an inside job.<br> - Who's that?<br> - It's Mother's protege.<br> No wise cracks.<br> Is that your son?<br> That? Say, listen, I've made<br> a lot of mistakes in my life,<br> but I'll be hanged<br> if I'll plead guilty to that.<br> Stop picking on Carlo!<br> He wouldn't have time to steal anything.<br> He's too busy eating.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Guess.<br> - Where is Godfrey?<br> - He isn't feeling very well.<br> - Who are you staring at?<br> - Just a minute, sister.<br> If I thought that were true,<br> I'd disown my parents.<br> So you got a passion for jewelry, huh?<br> Yes, and I got a passion<br> for socking cops.<br> - Where are they?<br> - Most of them are in cemeteries.<br> - Where is the necklace?<br> - Maybe I swallowed it.<br> You mustn't accuse Molly.<br> She's been with us a long time.<br> - That in itself is some recommendation.<br> - Thank you, Molly.<br> You're welcome.<br> I'll turn down the beds.<br> - Who is this Godfrey?<br> - He's the best butler we ever had.<br> Oh, I'm sure Godfrey didn't take them,<br> though we don't know much about him.<br> Godfrey wouldn't touch<br> those old pearls with a fork.<br> Just a minute. What do you mean<br> you don't know much about him?<br> We didn't get him<br> from an employment agency.<br> - My sister found him on a city dump.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - Are you accusing Godfrey?<br> - I only want my necklace.<br> It's so silly to think of Godfrey<br> wearing a pearl necklace.<br> - Where is this butler?<br> - He's probably in his room.<br> - Where is that?<br> - It's back this way.<br> That's his room over there.<br> Godfrey, if you've got 'em,<br> hide 'em!<br> - Hey, what kind of a joint is this?<br> - All right, lady.<br> Hello, men.<br> - Where are they?<br> - Where?<br> That's what I said.<br> Where?<br> #Where oh where<br> has my little dog gone #<br> Come on, snap out of it!<br> - You notice he's been drinking.<br> - He has not been drinking!<br> I don't blame him if he has.<br> This family's probably got to him too.<br> Do you mind if we search<br> your room, Godfrey?<br> Somebody lost?<br> There seems to be<br> a pearl necklace missing.<br> - Do you know anything about it?<br> - Well, let's look for it.<br> - That's too bad.<br> - It's too bad for you.<br> I wouldn't be so cocksure of everything.<br> This is a serious matter.<br> The pearls couldn't just<br> get up and walk away.<br> She probably threw them<br> out of the taxi.<br> Let's look under the rug.<br> Maybe that's where I put it.<br> We'll do the searching,<br> Godfrey, old boy.<br> - It's a pleasure.<br> - This is all very silly.<br> I can imagine a woman stealing pearls,<br> but what would Godfrey do with them?<br> - Look under the mattress.<br> - Yes, there's a dandy place.<br> Well, they're not here.<br> They must be there.<br> Just a minute. What makes you so sure<br> they oughta be under the mattress?<br> I read that that's where people<br> put things when they steal them.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Say, what are you up to?<br> I'd like to talk to you boys outside<br> for just a minute, if you don't mind.<br> - I'm terribly sorry, Godfrey.<br> - I told you so.<br> We're all terribly<br> sorry, Godfrey. Come, Cornelia.<br> Yah, yah, yah, yah!<br> I wanna apologize for my family.<br> They're all slightly hysterical.<br> - We got an idea what you're up against.<br> - I'd like to let the matter drop.<br> She probably mislaid her necklace.<br> I'm not certain she had one.<br> There's something phony<br> about the whole thing.<br> That's all a mistake.<br> And if you don't mind,<br> I'd like to send a little check<br> tomorrow to the pension fund.<br> - Okay, Mr. Bullock. Thanks very much.<br> - Good night.<br> - The whole thing's forgotten.<br> - Good night, boys.<br> Just what have you got<br> to say for yourself?<br> Aren't they going to do<br> anything about it?<br> No, and it's a good thing<br> for you that they're not.<br> And something else. If you don't find<br> your necklace, the joke's on you...<br> because it's not insured.<br> Cornelia lost her pearls,<br> and I've got mine!<br> Cornelia lost her pearls,<br> and I've got mine!<br> Cornelia lost her pearls,<br> and I've got mine!<br> Well, here we are, Tommy.<br> The village of forgotten men.<br> - How do you like it?<br> - I don't know but I prefer Newport.<br> It's a matter of choice.<br> Unfortunately, these men have no choice.<br> I still prefer Newport.<br> What is that<br> delightful aroma?<br> Oh, that's Old Man River.<br> You get used to it after a while.<br> Do you mean to say that people<br> really live in this place?<br> Well, they go through<br> the motions.<br> Tommy, observe yon<br> structure on your left.<br> That was the birthplace<br> of the celebrated butler Godfrey Smith.<br> - Where are the ashes of Godfrey Parke?<br> - Scattered to the winds.<br> - Hello, Duke. Well, well.<br> - Hiya, Mike.<br> - How's tricks?<br> - Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Flaherty.<br> Mr. Gray, pardon my wet paw.<br> I've been washing my lingerie.<br> - That's okay.<br> - Hey, Bob, look who's here.<br> - Hi, Bob.<br> - Well, bust my false teeth!<br> Say, thanks for the beans.<br> They got here just in time.<br> What's up? The beans was marvelous.<br> We ate everything but the can.<br> Don't thank me.<br> Thank Mr. Gray.<br> He's got a corner<br> on the bean market.<br> Is that the same corner<br> that prosperity's just around?<br> No, that's another one.<br> Hello, Arthur.<br> - Hello, Duke.<br> - Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Bellinger.<br> You look as though you've got a job too.<br> Is this an epidemic?<br> Hey, Mike. Let's get goin'.<br> Duke, we gotta run along.<br> This is moving day.<br> We gotta help the boys move their<br> shacks. The trucks are crowding in.<br> We oughta be in the river<br> by early spring.<br> We might be able to float<br> by that time. See you again.<br> Right.<br> That fellow with the bundle of wood<br> is Bellinger of the Second National.<br> When his bank failed,<br> he gave up everything<br> so his depositors wouldn't suffer.<br> - Not really?<br> - Really.<br> There are two kinds of people:<br> Those who fight the idea...<br> of being pushed into the river<br> and the other kind.<br> After all, things have always<br> been this way for some people.<br> These men are not<br> your responsibility.<br> There are different ways<br> of having fun.<br> You have a peculiar<br> sense of humor.<br> Here we have some very<br> fashionable apartment houses,<br> over there is<br> a very swanky nightclub...<br> while down here men starve<br> for want of a job.<br> - How does that strike you?<br> - What's this leading to?<br> Tommy, there's a very peculiar<br> mental process called thinking.<br> You wouldn't know<br> much about that.<br> But when I was living here,<br> I did a lot of it.<br> One thing I discovered was<br> that the only difference between<br> a derelict and a man is a job.<br> Sit down over here and rest your weary<br> bones. Let me tell you what I want.<br> Well, I'll listen, but I still think<br> you belong in a psychopathic ward.<br> You may be right, but let me tell you<br> my plan, and listen with both ears.<br> I have an idea...<br> Did you and Irene have a good time<br> while you were in Europe?<br> Oh, as good a time as anyone<br> could have with Irene.<br> - You should be more civil to Carlo.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't mind. Cherchez la femme.<br> - That will hold you.<br> Carlo always has such a clever answer<br> for everything.<br> Darling, do you want<br> some coffee?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - She didn't eat any dinner, either.<br> - You had plenty.<br> - I can't say anything!<br> - You never do.<br> - Oh, what's come over you?<br> We spend good money<br> to send you abroad,<br> and you're worse off<br> than when you left.<br> - Her liver is probably upset.<br> - Take a liver pill.<br> - I don't want a liver pill.<br> - You mustn't get upset.<br> You've broken many before<br> and never acted this way.<br> She's upset because Godfrey didn't fall<br> down in a faint when we got in today.<br> Why should Godfrey<br> fall in a faint?<br> He didn't make enough fuss<br> over her homecoming to suit her.<br> Well, Godfrey's<br> not the fussing kind. Shh.<br> Godfrey, I was just telling my daughters<br> you missed them while they were away.<br> Oh, yes, I did.<br> Very much, indeed.<br> - We missed you too, didn't we, Irene?<br> - Yes.<br> - I missed you, also.<br> - It's nice to miss everybody.<br> Then it makes it so nice<br> when we get together again.<br> There, there, darling.<br> It's nice to see you cheerful.<br> - You do have a way with you, Godfrey.<br> - Thank you.<br> There's no use denying the fact<br> that Godfrey has a way with him.<br> We must be running on.<br> Cornelia, cheer her up.<br> I'm a cinch.<br> Do you feel better now that<br> you know Godfrey missed us?<br> He missed me more.<br> I could tell by the light in his eyes.<br> Why don't throw yourself<br> in the man's arms?<br> You can't rush a man<br> like Godfrey.<br> You're getting<br> pretty old, you know?<br> He's really in love.<br> He's just hard to break down.<br> I could break him down<br> in no time at all.<br> - He'd have nothing to do with you.<br> - How do you know?<br> Because he wouldn't.<br> Don't you try anything.<br> I'm not saying I will,<br> and I'm not saying I won't<br> Come to think of it, Godfrey and<br> I have a little unfinished business.<br> You better leave it unfinished, unless<br> you want to be wearing a lamp for a hat.<br> Did you mean it<br> when you said you missed me?<br> Oh! Yes,<br> of course I did.<br> I mean, did you miss<br> Cornelia and me or just me?<br> - Well, I missed both of you.<br> - Not just me?<br> Oh, I may have missed you a little<br> more than I did Cornelia. Why?<br> I'm glad, because if you missed Cornelia<br> more, you'd probably miss me less.<br> - That sounds very logical.<br> - That's all I wanted to know.<br> - You look so cute in your apron.<br> - I'm not trying to look cute.<br> Molly has a cold,<br> and I'm doubling for her.<br> What's funny about that?<br> - She hasn't got a cold.<br> - No?<br> She's got the same thing I've got,<br> only you won't let me talk about that.<br> - You'll lose your temper.<br> - Well, not seriously.<br> - Will you let me do something?<br> - What do you want to do?<br> - Wipe.<br> - Oh, all right.<br> - You can tell me all about your trip.<br> - You won't get mad?<br> - Why should I?<br> - Because everybody was Godfrey.<br> Every... I don't want<br> to seem dull,<br> but I do seem to have a little trouble<br> following you at times.<br> Well, for instance, when I'd go<br> into a restaurant in Paris,<br> I'd close my eyes and say,<br> "The waiter is Godfrey.<br> I'm home, and he's<br> serving me dinner. "<br> - It made everything taste better.<br> - Why?<br> - Haven't you any sense?<br> - I'm afraid I haven't.<br> When I'd get in a cab,<br> the driver was Godfrey,<br> and I'd say,<br> "This is his chariot,<br> and he's taking me<br> to his castle on the mountains. "<br> Suppose you come down out of the<br> mountains and tell me about your trip.<br> We went to Venice, and I went for a ride<br> in one of those rowboats.<br> Not a matador. That was in Spain.<br> But something like a matador.<br> Do you, by any chance,<br> mean a gondolier?<br> That was the name of the boat. The man<br> that pushed it sang a beautiful song.<br> - It was beautiful.<br> - I see.<br> - So the man was Godfrey.<br> - I didn't even mind the smell.<br> It was very convenient to take a trip<br> abroad without leaving the kitchen.<br> Oh, you have a wonderful sense of humor.<br> I wish I had a sense of humor.<br> But I never can think<br> of the right thing to say.<br> Do you mind if I talk for a little bit,<br> while you catch your breath?<br> I'd love it.<br> While you've been away,<br> I've been doing some things also.<br> I've been trying to do things that<br> I thought would make you proud of me.<br> Oh, I was proud of you<br> before I went away.<br> Yes, but I mean<br> prouder still.<br> You see, you helped me<br> to find myself,<br> and I'm very grateful.<br> You'd make a wonderful husband.<br> I'm afraid not.<br> - I know how you feel about things.<br> - How?<br> Well, you're grateful to me because I<br> helped you to beat Cornelia,<br> and I'm grateful to you<br> because you helped me to beat life.<br> But that doesn't mean that<br> we have to fall in love.<br> If you don't want to,<br> but I'd make a wonderful wife.<br> Well, not for me,<br> I'm afraid.<br> You see, I like you very much.<br> But I had a very bitter experience.<br> But I won't bore you with that.<br> - Maybe she wasn't in love with you.<br> - Well, maybe not.<br> However, that's<br> beside the point.<br> You and I are friends.<br> I feel a certain<br> responsibility to you.<br> - That's why I wanted to tell you first.<br> - Tell me what?<br> Well, I thought it was about time<br> that I was moving on.<br> Godfrey!<br> Now, please.<br> - I won't cry, I promise.<br> - That's fine.<br> After all,<br> I'm your protege.<br> - You want me to improve myself?<br> - Yes.<br> You don't want me to go on being<br> just a butler all my life, do you?<br> - I want you to be anything you want.<br> - Well, that's very sweet.<br> - When are you leaving?<br> - Oh, pretty soon.<br> But I'll call you up<br> every now and then.<br> We'll have long chats.<br> I'll tell you how I'm getting on.<br> - Oh, we'll have lots of fun.<br> - Are you going back to her?<br> - To whom?<br> - That Indian woman.<br> Indian... Oh!<br> She was just<br> a fabrication.<br> Oh! Then, you weren't<br> married to her?<br> No, she was just a product<br> ofTommy Gray's imagination.<br> - Then there wasn't any?<br> - No!<br> Well, there couldn't<br> have been five children.<br> Well, naturally.<br> That makes a difference.<br> Yeah, that makes<br> a difference.<br> Did you ring, miss?<br> You needn't be so formal<br> when we're alone.<br> Shouldn't that rather increase<br> a butler's formality?<br> - But you're not a butler.<br> - I'm sorry if I've disappointed.<br> You might drop that superior<br> attitude for a moment.<br> There's a little matter I've wanted to<br> talk over with you for quite a while...<br> called "The Mystery<br> of Milady's Necklace"...<br> or "What Happened<br> to the Pearls?"<br> Pearls? Necklace? Oh, you mean the<br> one that disappeared last fall?<br> - The same.<br> - Didn't that ever turn up?<br> Oh, yes, it turned up,<br> but not in my possession.<br> I know the first part of the story, but<br> I wondered what you know might know?<br> - I can't imagine.<br> - One other story might interest you.<br> I met some people<br> on the boat coming over.<br> A Boston family,<br> quite distinguished.<br> They knew a great deal<br> about a family called... the Parkes.<br> The old Mayflower crowd.<br> Very upper crust too.<br> Never been a breath<br> of scandal.<br> It would be an awful shame to see<br> them made the laughing stock of Boston.<br> I should hate to see anyone<br> made a laughing stock.<br> Let's you and I take a long taxi ride<br> out Van Cortland Way.<br> Perhaps we could<br> exchange secrets.<br> - Is that a command?<br> - As you like.<br> I'll be waiting<br> around the corner.<br> Which corner?<br> This one or that one?<br> This corner.<br> It's impossible to exchange<br> intimate secrets here.<br> The traffic's almost as heavy as it is<br> at Grand Central Station.<br> Don't forget, darling.<br> Fifteen minutes.<br> Please, Godfrey,<br> you can't go with Cornelia.<br> But I didn't say I was going<br> anyplace with Miss Cornelia.<br> I know, but you will. She always<br> makes everybody do just as she likes.<br> But why should you care<br> whether I meet her or not?<br> I do care, that's why.<br> Cornelia's the one who doesn't care.<br> I think I should decide<br> those things for myself.<br> Oh, Godfrey, I don't want<br> to be annoying, but I... Oh!<br> Oh, see here...<br> You-You can't do that.<br> Uh, please, snap out of it.<br> Ohhh, this is<br> the craziest family.<br> Now see here, stop this nonsense.<br> Do you hear?<br> If you're faking one of your spells<br> to keep me from meeting Cornelia,<br> you're on the wrong track,<br> you hear?<br> - Do you hear?<br> - Mmm.<br> Must be some smelling salts.<br> Are you feeling better?<br> No?<br> Just a minute.<br> Godfrey knows how to take care<br> of little Irene.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Just lie there quietly, and Godfrey<br> will take care of everything.<br> Godfrey knows just how<br> to take care...<br> of these nasty old faints.<br> That's the girl.<br> Come right up here.<br> There you are.<br> Godfrey will soon fix Irene.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Just leave everything to Godfrey.<br> Godfrey will take care<br> of everything.<br> Now, you just sit right down<br> there like a good girl,<br> and in just a minute<br> you'll forget that you had any trouble.<br> I thought so. Let that be a lesson.<br> Godrey! Oh, Godfrey,<br> don't go away!<br> Oh, Godfrey,<br> now I know you love me.<br> - I do not love you!<br> - You do!<br> What is the meaning of this,<br> may I ask?<br> - Godfrey loves me!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Godfrey loves me!<br> - Godfrey, I demand an explanation!<br> - I think perhaps I had better resign.<br> - Yes, that's a good idea.<br> - What do you think your father'd say?<br> - I don't care. Godfrey loves me.<br> You put on some dry clothes<br> and come downstairs.<br> - Godfrey loves me!<br> - I never heard anything like this!<br> Shut that thing off!<br> I feel gloomy enough as it is!<br> - Something terrible has happened.<br> - What?<br> - Godfrey pushed Irene into a shower.<br> - What's terrible about that?<br> He's in love with her. I can't make<br> head nor tail out of the whole thing.<br> I can't make head nor tail<br> out of what you're saying.<br> The only thing is to send<br> him back where he came from.<br> Imagine, falling in love<br> with a butler.<br> If you're going to feel sorry<br> for anyone, feel sorry for Godfrey.<br> - Alexander!<br> - Don't "Alexander" me!<br> I've got something<br> more important to talk about.<br> Don't tell me you're going<br> to talk about money matters.<br> - Money, money, money!<br> - Yes, I am. But before I start,<br> I'm going to have<br> a little talk with Carlo.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - This is private, just for Carlo's ears.<br> You don't mind if we have<br> a little chat, Carlo, old boy?<br> You know, for some time,<br> Carlo, I've felt...<br> - What did you say to Carlo?<br> - I said good-bye.<br> - Did he go?<br> - He left through the side window.<br> - Where is he going?<br> - I don't know, but he won't be back.<br> - Now, sit down and do some listening.<br> - I've never seen you like this.<br> Sit down!<br> What's come over you?<br> - You're just in time to listen.<br> - Do you want Godfrey to listen?<br> Yes, I want Godfrey to listen.<br> This concerns him too.<br> You might as well all know,<br> point-blank, we're about broke.<br> You mean we haven't<br> any money left?<br> We've got this house, a few odds<br> and ends, and that's about all.<br> Not only that, I've lost all of my stock<br> in Bullock Enterprises.<br> I've borrowed some of the stockholder's<br> money trying to recoup my losses.<br> I don't know where I'm going to end up.<br> Maybe in jail.<br> - Alexander!<br> - But if I do end up in jail,<br> it'll be the first peace<br> I've had in 20 years.<br> And I don't want any of you<br> to chortle about Godfrey.<br> You may all end up on the dump.<br> - What are we going to do?<br> - May I intrude, sir?<br> I'm afraid things are not<br> as bad as you make out.<br> - What do you know about it?<br> - Well, sir,<br> I've known for a long time the Bullock<br> interests were in rather a bad way.<br> I offered to help you once,<br> but you declined that help.<br> So I took the liberty of dabbling in the<br> market on my own account. Here, sir.<br> - What's this?<br> - That's most of your stock.<br> I knew it had been dumped<br> on the market, so I sold short.<br> I don't understand. You sold short.<br> You mean gentlemen's underwear?<br> Wait! You mean that you've been making<br> money while I was losing it?<br> I did it in your interest, sir.<br> The stock has been endorsed over to you.<br> I don't understand.<br> You did this for me?<br> Well, sir, there comes a turning point<br> in every man's life.<br> A time when he needs help.<br> It happened to me, also.<br> This family helped me<br> I hope I repaid my debt.<br> Some of the money went into a project<br> of my own. I hope you won't mind.<br> Do you mean that you did<br> all that on $150 a month?<br> Well, hardly. You see,<br> with the aid ofTommy Gray,<br> I was able to transmute<br> a certain trinket into gold,<br> then into stock<br> and then back into pearls again.<br> Thank you, dear lady,<br> for the use of this trinket.<br> Oh, Godfrey!<br> Then you did steal them!<br> Well, I, uh... Perhaps Miss Cornelia<br> had better explain that.<br> - You win.<br> - What is this all about, anyway?<br> I put the pearls<br> under Godfrey's mattress.<br> Thank you, Miss Cornelia.<br> I wanted you to say that.<br> - But why?<br> - You wouldn't understand.<br> Here, Godfrey.<br> These are rightfully yours.<br> Oh, no, thank you. I repaid my debt,<br> and I'm grateful to all of you.<br> If anyone's indebted, we are, after<br> the way some of us have treated you.<br> I've been repaid in many ways.<br> I learned patience from Mr. Bullock.<br> I found Mrs. Bullock<br> at all times, shall we say, amusing.<br> That's complimentary, and don't forget<br> you said I looked as young as Cornelia.<br> - What good did you find in me, if any?<br> - A great deal.<br> You taught me the fallacy of<br> false pride. You taught me humility.<br> I don't understand you.<br> Miss Cornelia, there have been other<br> spoiled children in the world.<br> I happened to be<br> one of them myself.<br> You're a high-spirited girl.<br> I can only hope that you use those<br> high spirits in a more constructive way.<br> And so... good day.<br> You know,<br> I hate to see Godfrey go.<br> He's the only butler we ever had<br> who understood women.<br> Well, Molly, you told me to leave<br> my hat near the door. Remember?<br> I hate to see you leave,<br> Godfrey.<br> - Oh, Molly, you've been swell.<br> - The house will seem empty.<br> Well, I guess the best<br> friends have to part.<br> Will you say good-bye<br> to Miss Irene for me?<br> I don't think I can go through<br> that ordeal right now.<br> You're sweet, Molly.<br> Good-bye.<br> What is it?<br> What's the matter<br> with Cornelia?<br> What's the matter with everybody?<br> Mother, what's the trouble?<br> - He's gone.<br> - Who's gone?<br> - Godfrey.<br> - Where?<br> And Carlo's gone out of the window.<br> Everybody's gone!<br> Oh, Molly, has he gone?<br> Poor Molly.<br> He's not gonna get away from me.<br> Order the car, Molly.<br> I'll be right down.<br> - Hello, Duke.<br> - Hi, Mike.<br> Say, business<br> looks pretty good tonight.<br> I'll say it is. Mayor Courtney's<br> here tonight with a big party.<br> I'll have one of the boys<br> bring these down, Duke.<br> - Hello, Duke.<br> - Hello. We can't complain about this.<br> Complain? Why, we got<br> the Meriwethers here!<br> - So I heard.<br> - Big stuff, huh?<br> This is all Greek to me.<br> Oh, here's our wandering butler now.<br> Explain it to him.<br> - Hello, Duke.<br> - Arthur.<br> I've got an estimate from the contractor<br> on your housing plan for the winter.<br> He figures he can petition off<br> our present buildings into compartments,<br> take care of<br> at least 50 people.<br> It'll cost $5,800,<br> but that includes steam heat.<br> Forgotten men with steam. Sounds like<br> something that ought to be on the menu.<br> I'll talk with you<br> about it later, Arthur.<br> I've still got an interest in this<br> company. When do you pay dividends?<br> We're giving food and shelter to 50<br> in the winter and employment in summer.<br> - What more do you want?<br> - You're the most arbitrary butler ever.<br> - Ex-butler.<br> - Fired?<br> I quit. I felt that<br> foolish feeling coming on again.<br> - You mean Irene?<br> - What do you know about that?<br> Nobody knows anything about her love,<br> except all of Upper New York.<br> Guess I got out<br> just in time.<br> Why don't you marry<br> the girl?<br> - I've had enough of matrimony.<br> - What's wrong with butlers?<br> Lots of society girls<br> run away with their chauffeurs.<br> Never mind about that. Suppose<br> you write me out a check for $5,000?<br> - For what?<br> - A new dock.<br> Perhaps we'll get<br> some of the yachting trade.<br> Well, how about<br> an airplane landing?<br> We'll come to that later.<br> Say, mister, what happened<br> to the city dump that was here?<br> Well, this is it, but<br> most of it's been filled in.<br> - What happened to those forgotten men?<br> - Forgotten men?<br> - Oh, we got most of them out in time.<br> - Where's Godfrey?<br> - You mean Mr. Godfrey Smith?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, lady, his office is right over<br> there where it says "office. "<br> Oh, just where it used to be.<br> Thank you. Come on, Clarence.<br> Say, wait a minute!<br> What is this? A basket party?<br> - Good evening, Mr. Courtney.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Lovely evening.<br> - Yes.<br> Good evening.<br> Well, there you are.<br> Business is fine.<br> I'm stuck, you're nuts,<br> and I'm going back to Boston<br> before I disgrace my family.<br> - Good riddance.<br> - Oh, Godfrey, company has come.<br> - Hello.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> Yes, what are you doing here?<br> Don't let him off the hook.<br> You must leave at once.<br> Do you hear me?<br> We got rid of her. If I can help<br> you in any other way, let me know.<br> Oh, my, how you've<br> fixed this place up, Godfrey.<br> - It's much nicer than before.<br> - Oh, you noticed that?<br> - Are the forgotten men having a party?<br> - It's their annual reunion.<br> - I saw the mayor. Is he one too?<br> - He's the guest of honor.<br> Oh, it's a lovely view.<br> - The bridge is always there?<br> - Most always.<br> Oh, you have a kitchen!<br> I'm gonna like this place.<br> What's over here?<br> Oh, is this where you sleep?<br> That's the general purpose<br> of the room. Any observations?<br> I think it's very cute,<br> but we'll have to change the wallpaper.<br> - What do you mean "we"?<br> - Oh, I don't like green wallpaper.<br> You won't have to look at it.<br> You're going home right now.<br> - Oh, but I can't go home.<br> - Why not?<br> - I can't go home after what happened.<br> - What happened?<br> You know what happened<br> just as well as I do.<br> - Now see here...<br> - Oh, go on and lose your temper.<br> I love it when<br> you lose your temper.<br> Why can't you let me alone?<br> Because you're my responsibility,<br> and someone has to take care of you.<br> - I can take care of myself.<br> - Look me in the eye and say that.<br> You love me,<br> and you know it.<br> There's no sense in struggling against<br> a thing when it's got you.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> Oh, that's Clarence.<br> I'm sorry I was delayed,<br> Miss Irene.<br> - I had to go around the back way.<br> - Put the wood over there.<br> You can put the groceries<br> right there in the kitchen.<br> - That's fine. Thank you, Clarence.<br> - What's the idea?<br> I brought some wood and food.<br> It should last us for a week.<br> It's a wonder you didn't bring<br> a minister and license.<br> I never thought of that.<br> - May I come in?<br> - Oh, Mr. Courtney.<br> Mr. Gray said there were a couple of<br> people here who wanted to get married.<br> - Are you it?<br> - Can you marry us without a license?<br> It may get me<br> into a lot of trouble,<br> but I guess I've known<br> your family long enough.<br> - Who are you going to marry?<br> - Godfrey. This is Godfrey.<br> Oh. How do you do, Godfrey?<br> Does your father<br> know about this?<br> Everybody knows about it<br> except Godfrey.<br> Well, I guess we better<br> have a witness.<br> - Clarence, stand right down here.<br> - What?<br> That's fine. Right there.<br> Come on, Godfrey. Right there.<br> Well, now, uh,<br> join hands, please.<br> - No, the right hand.<br> - Oh.<br> Stand still, Godfrey.<br> It'll all be over in a minute.<br>
