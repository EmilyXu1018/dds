                        -Your kid sister?<br> -My sister Eileen.<br> What's this Doll's House,<br> a kid show with fairies?<br> lt's a well-known classic.<br> -''Not since the debutt of the...''<br> -Debut.<br> Debut. Okay, ''Not since the debut<br> of the great Sarah Bernhardt<br> ''has an audience been held<br> so spellbound as<br> ''that which witnessed the remarkable<br> performance of lbsen's A Doll's House<br> ''by a young Columbus girl,<br> Eileen Sherwood.''<br> You're sure pouring it on, ain't ya?<br> When did this happen?<br> -lt's happening tonight at 8:30.<br> -What? Hey, something new.<br> Now they're writing them<br> before they see them.<br> l won't have time to write it after the show.<br> We're having a party tonight<br> at the house for Eileen.<br> -A party! With the dolls?<br> -Will you scram?<br> Say, l thought the boss' daughter<br> was the star of that thing.<br> That's tomorrow. They're alternating,<br> tonight Eileen, tomorrow Annie.<br> Here it is, Mr. Hawkins,<br> and here's Eileen's picture.<br> You blow it up big, like you promised.<br> Jerusalem, this blurb<br> for an amateur theatrical?<br> And l want it in every edition,<br> beginning with the one<br> that goes on the streets tonight.<br> What are you trying to do,<br> push the war out of the paper?<br> You promised me you'd give Eileen a break,<br> now didn't you?<br> Yeah, provided you take care<br> of the boss' daughter tomorrow night.<br> -Okay.<br> -And just as many adjectives<br> or there'll be trouble.<br> -Believe me, l'll do Annie up just fine.<br> -Well, see that you do.<br> Leave it to me. l'll give her the works.<br> Two more minutes.<br> But, George,<br> l still say l should have played the doctor...<br> Curtains.<br> Hello, Billy. You look great. Dad, Grandma,<br> you wait till you see the crowd outside,<br> and wait till you see the review l've written.<br> lt's absolutely marvelous.<br> Where's Eileen? l've got to see her.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -What's the matter? What's happened?<br> -We don't know.<br> We were in there and all of a sudden<br> Mr. Heller came in with Annie.<br> -lt looks like dirty work at the crossroads.<br> -Dirty work? What kind of a...<br> -Hello.<br> -What happened?<br> A last-minute change.<br> Annie Wilkinson's playing the part tonight.<br> What?<br> -Remember, we're very, very late.<br> -l said how come?<br> -My sister won the toss, didn't she?<br> -Yes, but...<br> Yes, but Annie's father owns a newspaper<br> and he put the pressure on.<br> -Quiet, please.<br> -Quiet nothing. l'll tear this place apart.<br> -Mr. Heller, you can't do this.<br> -lt's all settled.<br> -What's... You're not going to...<br> -Annie, on stage.<br> -Annie. Annie!<br> -Miss Wilkinson, if you don't mind.<br> -Well, get her.<br> -Now, folks,<br> for the last three weeks<br> l've been telling you that...<br> Mr. Heller, l want to tell you what's going on,<br> and you're not...<br> Now, folks, all of you,<br> you'll have to get out front.<br> -Yes, you try and put us out. l'm not...<br> -Will you please listen to me?<br> Eileen's review is already written.<br> -lt's in the paper now.<br> -Ready, everybody. Please.<br> That paper'll be on the streets in an hour.<br> lt says she's sensational in A Doll's House.<br> -Curtain! Curtain!<br> -Her picture's in the paper...<br> Hide the Christmas tree carefully, Helen.<br> Well, that... You little...<br> -Eileen, are you going to cry all night?<br> -Yes!<br> Then take that black stuff off your eyes.<br> lt's getting all over the pillow.<br> Holy smoke, you're a sight.<br> Nice piece of writing anyway, Ruth.<br> You're getting better and better.<br> You'd better frame it, Grandma.<br> That's fini for me on the Courier.<br> l'm the laughingstock of Columbus.<br> That paper is all over town,<br> and everybody knows l didn't play the part.<br> l'll never be able to show my face<br> in this town again.<br> Neither will l, Eileen,<br> if that's any comfort to you.<br> Now, girls, there's nothing we can do<br> about this anyway. Let's get to bed.<br> -lt's 2:00.<br> -Dad,<br> now that l've lost this job,<br> l've always felt that...<br> Ruth, l'm not going to discuss New York<br> all over again.<br> Why, you can get another job<br> right here in Columbus.<br> You can go back to teaching.<br> -But l...<br> -She doesn't want to go back to teaching.<br> She wants to write, and she ought to be<br> where magazines and publishers are.<br> -Mother, are you encouraging this insanity?<br> -Sure!<br> You're just talking<br> a lot of old-fashioned twaddle.<br> What's a girl to do,<br> sit around home just because it's home<br> until some local dope decides to marry her?<br> Columbus boys are not dopes. Why,<br> l was born and brought up here myself.<br> Now, Son, be reasonable.<br> She wants a career,<br> and she's got plenty on the ball, and<br> if she thinks New York is the place to be...<br> Why, certainly, it's where Ruth should be.<br> That's where all the publishers are.<br> That's where everybody is.<br> l certainly think we ought to go.<br> -You, too?<br> -Well, naturally,<br> that's where all the theaters are, too.<br> And what kind of a career<br> can l have around here?<br> Ruth wouldn't think of going without me,<br> would you? Well, of course not.<br> No. No, of course not, Eileen.<br> Dad, there's no reason<br> why she shouldn't go with me.<br> l won't hear of it. Won't hear of it.<br> Good night.<br> Jeez.<br> Girls, you can start packing<br> right after breakfast.<br> -Grandma.<br> -Grandma.<br> l wonder what those boys<br> at the Little Theater will think<br> when l'm an actress in New York.<br> Well, that's the advantage<br> of not leaving any men behind.<br> l don't have to worry what becomes of them.<br> l know, dear, it's different with you.<br> -Boys never meant anything in your life.<br> -Not after they got a load of you they didn't.<br> Gee, l've got more of your junk in there<br> than my own.<br> -Eileen, where's my typewriter?<br> -Well, it was right there on the desk.<br> Well, it's gone. Who took it?<br> Grandma! Grandma!<br> -What's the matter?<br> -My typewriter's...<br> Sure, l traded it in. Got in just ahead<br> of that new installment buying law.<br> Oh, gee, darling. How can l ever repay you?<br> That's simple.<br> Just write another Gone With The Wind.<br> -lt's a cinch.<br> -Come on, come on, shake a leg!<br> -lt's 5 miles to the bus depot.<br> -Darling, can you grab my hat there?<br> -Yes.<br> -Excuse me, Grandma.<br> You'd better hurry<br> if you want to be on that bus.<br> -We have plenty of time.<br> -No, we haven't.<br> -Grandma, where did l put my purse?<br> -How the dickens would l know?<br> Well, let's look for it.<br> Hurry, Eileen,<br> we've got to go clear across town.<br> -Don't worry.<br> -Ruth, here are the tickets and $100.<br> -l wish we didn't have to take this.<br> -lt's all right. That'll get you started,<br> and then every month or so<br> whatever l can spare...<br> Thank you, darling,<br> but maybe you won't have to at all.<br> You mustn't worry about it.<br> Where in the world could you have put it?<br> -You'll watch over Eileen, won't you?<br> -Of course l will.<br> Here it is.<br> -Thank you, Grandma.<br> -Now, hurry, Eileen.<br> -We're late now. We'll never make that bus.<br> -We'll be on it. l've arranged everything.<br> Hello, Harvey. So nice of you to come.<br> Did you say watch over Eileen?<br> Eileen watch over me.<br> Hurry up, Ruth,<br> you know Harvey has a schedule to make.<br> -Goodbye, Grandma.<br> -Goodbye, darling.<br> -Goodbye, Dad.<br> -Goodbye, dear.<br> -Well, goodbye, Dad.<br> -Write often.<br> -l will darling, yes.<br> -Good.<br> l'm going to keep up with your career.<br> l'll be buying all the magazines...<br> Yes! Yes, you do that, Grandma. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, Dad.<br> Well, l hope you're satisfied, Mother.<br> Happiest day of my life.<br> -Taxi?<br> -Oh, boy, New York.<br> Take your bag, lady? Taxi?<br> -Yes, thanks.<br> -No, thanks. Give that right back.<br> Eileen, we carry our own bags,<br> and we carry our own bodies.<br> The first thing we've gotta do is buy a paper<br> and look up the rooms for rent.<br> Must we do that?<br> Ruth, let's stop at a hotel<br> and get a nice fresh start in the morning.<br> Eileen, maybe l should have told you earlier.<br> You know this $100?<br> That's the last money we ever take from Dad.<br> -The last?<br> -The last.<br> -But supposing...<br> -Then we starve.<br> We beg, we borrow or steal.<br> Darling, is that a promise?<br> -Yes, Ruth.<br> -All right.<br> We'd better check the heavy bag<br> then start looking for the room.<br> -Come on.<br> -All right.<br> l think it's foolish to look for anything<br> when our vitalities are so low.<br> Here, you hold this.<br> lf things get tough,<br> we can always flop in one of these.<br> Gee, l can't get this key out.<br> -Well, try this one, Ruth.<br> -l will not.<br> l've got a dime invested in this locker.<br> l'll tear it apart first.<br> -Having trouble?<br> -Yes, a little.<br> Well, allow me.<br> Easy does it. Hot, isn't it?<br> Yeah, but you'll cool off.<br> -Wasn't that nice?<br> -Fresh guy.<br> Come on, Eileen. Now you take the overnight<br> case, and l'll take the typewriter.<br> Well, this is the last one on the list.<br> Ruth, no matter what it is,<br> if it's got a bed in it, let's take it.<br> Gee, l had no idea rents were so high.<br> This doesn't look like much, does it?<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening, my dear young ladies.<br> Am l wrong in presuming that you are<br> looking for a haven in this troubled world?<br> -No. No, we're just looking for a room.<br> -Seek no more. You have reached your goal.<br> -We have?<br> -Absolutely.<br> -How high up is it?<br> -lt is not up. lt's down.<br> Hey.<br> Follow me, young ladies, and l will show you<br> the best value for your money<br> you can buy in Greenwich Village.<br> Come in, my dear young ladies, enter.<br> lsn't it just what<br> you've been dreaming about?<br> Come in, come in. Don't be bashful.<br> Make yourself right at home.<br> Thank you. lt's really very...<br> But, you see, as yet we haven't decided<br> whether or not we want to...<br> Wait.<br> Note the exquisite imitation fireplace<br> and these big comfortable day beds.<br> Just look at that interesting<br> and exciting dormer window.<br> Look, life passes up and down<br> in front of you like a regular parade.<br> What more could a young person<br> with a typewriter want?<br> Am l wrong in presuming that<br> you are an author?<br> -Haven't you anything higher up?<br> -Higher up. Higher up.<br> My dear young lady,<br> why don't you let me show you the place<br> -before you raise a lot of objections?<br> -Yes, Ruth, let Mr...<br> Appopolous.<br> Yes, show us the place.<br> You have a head on your shoulders,<br> young lady.<br> And now, let me point out<br> a few features of this beautiful suite.<br> A, it is summer.<br> B, it is at least 30 degrees cooler down here<br> than anywheres higher up.<br> C, it is only $45 a month.<br> $45? Thank you very much, Mr. Appopolous.<br> We'll let you know. Come on, Eileen.<br> Ruth, couldn't we stay here for a few days<br> and then if we like it we can...<br> l'll do better than that.<br> You can have the place for a month, on trial,<br> at absolutely no cost to you.<br> Then if you are not 100% satisfied,<br> l will give you back your first month's rent.<br> -The whole month?<br> -The whole month.<br> And August has 31 days.<br> Do you mind if l go outside<br> and talk it over with my sister?<br> What is there to talk over?<br> You see the place, you know the price.<br> l'll tell you what, we'll go down to<br> the bus terminal and pick up our baggage.<br> What for? Why have l got a handyman?<br> Jenson. Jenson.<br> Wait a minute,<br> we haven't decided anything yet.<br> Now, l am going to show you<br> where everything is.<br> ln there, we have a model kitchenette,<br> complete in every detail.<br> Adjacent is a luxurious bathroom.<br> -They're awfully small.<br> -Small.<br> ln those two rooms you won't entertain.<br> And you, young lady,<br> are you artistic and fussy like your sister?<br> Well, l'm going to try to get a job<br> on the stage.<br> An actress.<br> Well, you certainly have the face<br> and build for it.<br> Thank you.<br> What, Mr. Appopolous?<br> Jenson, go to the bus station<br> and get these young ladies' bags.<br> But we haven't said we'd take it.<br> This places you<br> under absolutely no obligations.<br> And l'm so tired.<br> -Well...<br> -When am l gonna fix the water pipes?<br> -There's been a lot of hollering.<br> -Never mind the hollering.<br> There's been no hollering at all. He's crazy.<br> Go ahead.<br> These poor tired girls want to go to bed.<br> And l'll tell you what l'll do.<br> lf you take these luxurious rooms,<br> l will leave that painting exactly where it is.<br> lt's charming.<br> -Yeah, who did it?<br> -Me.<br> Painting is one of my interests.<br> l also write epic poetry and epic drama.<br> Well, ladies, what do you say?<br> The painting stays.<br> Let's take it, Ruth.<br> l can't see what we can lose.<br> Mr. Appopolous said<br> he would give us our money back.<br> Legally, you have me where you want me.<br> l gave my word in front of two witnesses.<br> -Three, including me.<br> -Please, Ruth.<br> Well, all right, Eileen, but remember now...<br> l won't blame you, don't worry.<br> $10, $20, $30, $40,<br> $41, $42, $43, $44...<br> -$45.<br> -What was that?<br> -What was what?<br> -That noise. The whole room shook.<br> That just shows you how<br> you'll get used to it. l didn't even notice it.<br> -Get used to it?<br> -You mean it happens all the time?<br> You won't even be conscious of it.<br> A little blasting, the new subway.<br> You mean they're blasting<br> right underneath us?<br> What are you worrying about? Those<br> engineers know how much dynamite to use.<br> But does it go on all the time?<br> No, no, they knock off at midnight,<br> and they don't start again<br> until 6:00 in the morning.<br> -6:00 in the morning?<br> -6:00 in the morning?<br> We can't stay here.<br> Listen, in New York you live either,<br> A, over a subway,<br> or B, where they're building a subway,<br> or C, you don't live in New York.<br> Stop double-talking<br> and give us our money back.<br> What are you getting so hysterical about?<br> l said l would give you your money back,<br> and l will, if at the end of the month<br> you are still dissatisfied.<br> Good night, ladies. Sleep tight.<br> Ruth, what are we going to do?<br> We're going to do 30 days.<br> Hey, get away from there.<br> Go on.

Let's get off and walk.<br> No, l'm not gonna quit.<br> Anybody can walk out. That's easy,<br> but l'm going to stay<br> and fight Craven to a finish.<br> Here, here, wait a second.<br> l'm not through yet.<br> Come and sit down.<br> You see, there's a thrill to this job,<br> if l can do what l want.<br> Work on stories that are alive, and help<br> authors with talent to dig those stories out.<br> What do you think?<br> l think it's just fine, Mr. Baker,<br> and l also think it's after 3:00.<br> And if l ever come across the kind of author<br> you're looking for, l'll let you know.<br> -Good night.<br> -Hey, wait a second.<br> What for?<br> l can't even get a word in edgewise.<br> l can't seem to remind you<br> that l'm an author,<br> and that l have written some stories<br> about Columbus. Remember?<br> Sure, and l read them.<br> Yeah, and it took till 3:30 in the morning to<br> find out they aren't even worth mentioning.<br> -What are you talking about? They're good.<br> -They are?<br> -Yes.<br> -Well, why didn't you say so?<br> -Didn't l?<br> -No.<br> Well, l'm telling you now.<br> They're quite good.<br> -Just quite good.<br> -Well, isn't that enough?<br> You mean, if you could publish them,<br> you wouldn't?<br> No, l wouldn't. The people come off,<br> but the stories are flat.<br> They don't get anywhere. Nothing happens.<br> That's because not enough happens to you.<br> lt doesn't?<br> That's what l said.<br> Why, you can't lead a quiet, sheltered life...<br> Quiet? Sheltered? Down in that tunnel?<br> With subway blasts bouncing me<br> all over the bed,<br> and Appopolous, our Rasputin landlord,<br> and Eileen dragging home<br> newspaper geniuses,<br> and drug-store Romeos and anything else<br> she happens to meet up with during the day,<br> and football players drifting through<br> in their drawers<br> and odd callers looking for good old Effie.<br> Not to mention the rest of the world<br> snooping through the window<br> as though we were some kind<br> of a public exhibition.<br> -Hire a hall!<br> -Shut up!<br> -Did you say sheltered?<br> -That's it, that's exactly the stuff.<br> -Well, go on, write it.<br> -Write what?<br> Well, about all those people.<br> Start your story in Columbus.<br> Bring it to New York.<br> Write about Rasputin, Eileen, the blasts,<br> the menagerie. Gee, it's wonderful.<br> Why, many an author would give<br> his right hand for material like that.<br> l see what you mean.<br> Of course, of course, l'm going to do it.<br> -When can l have it?<br> -l don't know.<br> l'm gonna work right now. You'd better<br> go home before you get killed. Good night.<br> -Quiet!<br> -Shut up!<br> What do you think this is,<br> Grand Central Station?<br> -ls that you, Ruth?<br> -Yes, dear.<br> -What's all that noise out there?<br> -Nothing, just me.<br> -Well, what time is it?<br> -3:30.<br> You were out with a man.<br> -And you've had no experience with men.<br> -lsn't it awful?<br> Aren't you ashamed?<br> And you were supposed to take care of me.<br> Eileen, l love New York.<br> l love everything about it.<br> l like the air. l like...<br> You must get pretty plastered<br> after a day's ironing.<br> But l don't touch a drop<br> after the football season starts.<br> ls that all you do, play football?<br> Well, l tried breaking<br> into the wrestling racket,<br> but you've got to rehearse so darn much.<br> Which way do you want<br> these pleats turned?<br> Toward Mecca.<br> Well, there it is. All finished.<br> You know, l got a swell story<br> you ought to write.<br> How Helen and me met and got married.<br> l had a job peddling vacuum cleaners,<br> and my first day out,<br> my first client was Helen.<br> Well, l started to give her a demonstration,<br> and before either one of us realized it,<br> we were in love.<br> l never did get back to the office.<br> Well, what happened to the vacuum cleaner?<br> lt's upstairs. We still hear from the company.<br> That'd make a great story, Wreck.<br> Tell Eileen l've gone up to see Mr. Baker.<br> l'll be back in a couple of hours.<br> Okay.<br> Wreck, you said<br> you'd only be here a couple of nights.<br> That means you've gotta get out tonight.<br> Yeah, l know, Ruth,<br> but the old lady didn't arrive on schedule.<br> Sorry, Wreck, but l need this place<br> to work in. l'm afraid that's final.<br> Yeah, but she's liable to blow in any minute.<br> What are you looking at, you old bezel?<br> Well, of course l wrote it in an awful hurry.<br> There's still lots of things l could do with it.<br> -Nothing that l can see.<br> -Terrible, huh?<br> No, it's great. As far as l'm concerned,<br> it's in the next issue,<br> and Mr. Craven will have read it<br> in a half hour. You wait here.<br> You know you're quite a gal.<br> l like you very much.<br> -He's had it over an hour.<br> -Now, now, don't you worry.<br> He's a slow reader. Sit down and relax.<br> Say, where's that Sherwood contract?<br> In a few minutes, Mr. Baker.<br> Gee, l've never signed a contract before.<br> He might not like the story.<br> Come here.<br> Look, here's the layout of the next issue.<br> l wanna show you where your story will go.<br> Wait. l meant to tell you. l don't like the title.<br> l don't like it, either.<br> -Well, we've gotta get another one.<br> -Well, l have thought of some others.<br> -Like what?<br> -Well, it all seems to hinge on Eileen.<br> l mean, she's in it so much<br> that l thought of simply calling it...<br> -''My Sister Eileen.''<br> -Yes, yes, that's it.<br> Might be good. lt might be perfect.<br> Let's see what it looks like.<br> -''My Sister...''<br> -Now.<br> -Sorry to intrude.<br> -lntrude, nothing. We were waiting for you.<br> Nice job.<br> l didn't think Columbus had it in her.<br> What did l tell you? lt's a magnificent job.<br> Yes, she ought to be able<br> to sell that somewhere.<br> What? Why the dickens<br> do you think l asked you to read it?<br> Because you want to put it in The Manhatter,<br> but it's not the type of material<br> for our policy. l thought we settled that.<br> No, we haven't. As a matter of fact,<br> you and l are gonna have a showdown<br> on policy right now.<br> -No, please.<br> -Why?<br> Because this happens<br> to be Miss Sherwood's story?<br> What are you talking about?<br> No, because it happens to be<br> the finest thing of its kind l've ever read.<br> But the wrong kind.<br> Look, Frank, either that story goes<br> in our next issue, or l quit.<br> No, that's absurd, Mr. Baker.<br> Well, l guess l'll have<br> to accept your resignation, Bob.<br> Good.<br> But not until that issue is off the press,<br> unless you don't care about another job<br> in the publishing business.<br> Thanks for letting me see<br> your delightful story, Miss Sherwood.<br> The Sherwood contract, Mr. Baker.<br> l don't think we'll need this now.<br> -Wreck, Wreck!<br> -What's the matter, honey?<br> lt's Mother. She saw you.<br> She said she happened to glance in<br> the window, and a naked man cursed at her.<br> You mean that old wagon is your mother?<br> She'll come down here and accuse the girls,<br> and they're liable to tell her about us.<br> -Not them. They're too regular.<br> -Especially that Eileen, huh?<br> Well, anyhow, l can't stay here anymore.<br> Ruth told me l had to get out by tonight.<br> But l'll tackle Eileen. She's a soft touch.<br> You stay away from that Eileen.<br> Well, all right then.<br> Where do you want me to sleep?<br> Well, if we could only<br> scrape up a few dollars,<br> you could stay at the Y until Mother leaves.<br> Maybe we could hock something.<br> Yeah, that's an idea.<br> -Wreck, do you think you should?<br> -Quiet.<br> They won't lend you a dime on that.<br> Yeah, but this gold frame might be worth<br> a couple of bucks.<br> There, the room looks a lot better<br> without it already.<br> l'll hide it out in the back alley until later.<br> -Wreck, you're so ingenious.<br> -Lucky you.<br> -Hello, Helen. Where's the Wreck?<br> -He's around, like always.<br> Gee, the laundry looks swell.<br> lt was awfully sweet of him.<br> lt was a pleasure, Eileen.<br> lsn't it too bad the Wreck's leaving today?<br> You're gonna miss him.<br> Yes, we will. He's certainly a handy man<br> to have around the house.<br> You don't have<br> to tell me the Wreck's good points.<br> l suppose l should thank you<br> for giving him back to me at all.<br> -You're crazy, Helen.<br> -Well, l'll be darned.<br> -Why, you ungrateful little... Little...<br> -Snip's the word you're reaching for, darling.<br> Well, this is the end.<br> Now, you take that Georgia Peach of yours<br> out of here and don't ever come back.<br> That's exactly what we'll do.<br> Come on, Wreck.<br> You're all wrong, Helen. Why, if l ever<br> even thought about Eileen in that way,<br> may l be struck dead on this spot.<br> That was a close call, Wreck.<br> -Helen, are you in there?<br> -Mother!<br> That's the man.<br> What are you doing associating<br> with these horrible people?<br> Well, now, just a minute.<br> lf you dare to address me, l'll call the police.<br> You get upstairs.<br> -Hello, Helen.<br> -Doesn't anybody knock around here?<br> Hello, girls. l'm Effie. l dropped in<br> on you the other night, remember?<br> Hiya, muscle-bound.<br> Hey, how are you two lovebirds?<br> -What? What did you say? Helen.<br> -No, no, Mother, we're married.<br> -To that?<br> -See here...<br> Shut up. Upstairs.<br> l'm gonna wait until Mother's Day<br> and then sock her.<br> Did l talk out of turn?<br> No, no, no, you just added<br> a little pleasant excitement to the day.<br> Say, have l had any callers<br> since you kids moved in here?<br> -One or two.<br> -l thought so.<br> -Eileen, will you put the clothes away, dear?<br> -Yes.<br> Well, in case they come around,<br> would you mind giving them my new cards?<br> Psychic readings, huh?<br> You ought to leave some of those<br> at the Russian Blini.<br> What do you two kids do to earn a living,<br> that is, when you can find it?<br> -Well, l act, and my sister writes.<br> -When we can find it.<br> Say, they're crying for your type<br> in musical shows. l got loads of contacts.<br> -Really?<br> -That's not my sister's line.<br> Thanks just the same.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Well, kids, bonjour.<br> -Sure you left enough cards?<br> -Temporarily.<br> So long.<br> -She's really an awfully nice girl.<br> -Yeah, the spiritual type.<br> Well, what happened today?<br> You didn't get into anybody's<br> inside waiting room, did you?<br> -No, l was at the food show.<br> -What are they casting at the food show?<br> Well, l saw a lot of people coming out<br> with big bags of samples,<br> so l thought we might<br> as well have some, too.<br> We've got enough junk here<br> for a week. Look!<br> ''Vita-Kernels.'' ''Zippies.''<br> ''Rough-O.''<br> ''Nature's Broom.''<br> Gonna have breakfast all day long.<br> But it's good for you. lt's roughage.<br> l'd like to vary it with a little smoothage,<br> like a steak.<br> l forgot. Frank and l are friends again.<br> l explained everything.<br> Who did you tell him Effie was,<br> our fairy godmother?<br> Gee, l had a swell lunch.<br> l had tomato juice,<br> a pimento and olive sandwich,<br> a tuna surprise, a giant double malt<br> with marble cake.<br> That's right, dear. Keep your strength up.<br> You're eating for two now.<br> Well, it's a funny thing, Ruth.<br> You don't seem to be losing any weight.<br> How can l on potatoes, bread and spaghetti?<br> l'm starving all day long,<br> and l keep getting fatter.<br> l think l'll go on a diet of Nature's Broom.<br> ''Delicious with strawberries and cream.''<br> What isn't?<br> You know, l wouldn't mind this place,<br> or chiseling our meals, or anything,<br> if l only thought<br> it was getting us somewhere.<br> Ruth, do you think we ought to go home<br> for a little vacation?<br> No, l think we ought to stay right here<br> and do a little work.<br> You remember, darling,<br> if at first you don't succeed,<br> it's simple, you just tackle it again.<br> You write 50 million words<br> and then 100 million words after that.<br> Some of them are bound to fall together<br> right, if only by the law of averages.<br> Well, we certainly could wire Father<br> before starving to death.<br> No, we can't.<br> We took an oath on that, remember?<br> Now, l want a little quiet around here.<br> You can start by bolting the front door.<br> Yes, Ruth.<br> Congratulate me, young ladies.<br> Today is the big day.<br> Tonight my one-man show opens.<br> l have come to take my...<br> What kind of funny game goes on here?<br> Where is my painting?<br> -Didn't you take it?<br> -l didn't even notice it was gone.<br> Do not bother to give me a cock-and-bull<br> story. What have you done with it?<br> Why, it must have been stolen.<br> Maybe it was the same gang<br> that swiped the Mona Lisa.<br> lf you didn't take it, who did?<br> You know everybody<br> who comes into this apartment.<br> We don't even know half of them,<br> including you.<br> My dear lady, that painting was the last<br> existing canvas of my blue-green period.<br> What happened to the others? Termites?<br> -That's your last word?<br> -Termites.<br> That's all l want to know.<br> Didn't even notice it was gone.<br> Ruth, l wonder<br> who could have taken that thing.<br> There must be an idiot sneak thief<br> in the neighborhood.<br> -Now, Eileen, bolt that back door.<br> -The lock is broken.<br> What's the matter, Ruth?<br> You look terribly down.<br> Didn't you finish your story?<br> Yeah, it's finished. lt was great.<br> l was famous.<br> The world was dangling contracts<br> in front of me by the thousands.<br> We were just rolling in money.<br> Then Mr. Craven woke me up.<br> The story was thrown out.<br> -Mr. Baker fought for it and was fired.<br> -Ruth!<br> lt's bad enough<br> to feel you can't write your own name,<br> but it's on account of my stuff<br> that Bob Baker's life is turned inside out.<br> l'm a jinx besides.<br> Gee, Ruth, if you start feeling that way,<br> who's gonna hold me up?<br> l'm not worried about you, Eileen.<br> Not while there's a man alive.<br> But after all, men are only an escape.<br> Comes another escape.<br> Sherwood residence. Miss Ruth Sherwood.<br> -For me?<br> -Who's calling?<br> What? What? Yes, yes, she's here.<br> Just a minute. Wait a second.<br> Ruth, it's Chic Clark's paper.<br> Hello. Yes, yes, this is she. Her.

Hurry up.<br> Yes, yes, l'm ready, Mr. Bains.<br> Sands. Sands Street, Brooklyn.<br> Yes. Sure. Sure, l understand.<br> Yes, right away, Mr. Bains.<br> -l can't believe it.<br> -What is it? What did he want?<br> They're gonna give me a chance<br> to show what l can do.<br> -l got an assignment over in Brooklyn.<br> -Brooklyn? What happened over there?<br> A merchant marine, a Portuguese ship<br> with a load of young cadets.<br> l gotta do a human interest story.<br> You're not going over there<br> with a run in your stocking.<br> Come on back and take it off.<br> This is the pardon from the governor.<br> We're saved by the bell, Eileen.<br> l guess Chic Clark was some good after all.<br> -Yeah, l guess l owe Mr. Clark an apology.<br> -Yes.<br> l always thought he was just trying<br> to get around you. l still think so.<br> What do they pay reporters?<br> Well, whatever it is,<br> it's more than we're living on now.<br> Paper. Oh, dear, the address.<br> -Paper and pen. Paper and pen.<br> -What happened?<br> Pier 67. Sands Street, Brooklyn.<br> Bye, Eileen, take care of everything.<br> Good luck, Ruth.<br> Eileen. Well, where is Brooklyn?<br> -You can't miss it.<br> -That's a help.<br> Where are you, Eleanor?<br> -Chic, how did you get in here?<br> -Your back door lock is busted.<br> Yes, yes, l know. You scared me to death.<br> Take it easy, sugar. l happened<br> to see Ruth ducking down the subway,<br> and l says, ''Maybe Eleanor is alone.''<br> Yes, she was on her way to Brooklyn.<br> Chic, l wanna thank you<br> for getting Ruth that assignment<br> with Mr. Bains and everything.<br> Forget it.<br> Now, let's get your future straightened out.<br> Well, l've been waiting for that interview<br> to be published, Chic.<br> -This week, sugar.<br> -Thanks.<br> Well, you'd better go now.<br> You'll excuse me, won't you?<br> Excuse you?<br> After l went and fixed it to get you alone<br> without that eagle-eyed sister<br> of yours around?<br> lt wasn't the editor. lt was you.<br> You sent Ruth over to Brooklyn<br> on a wild goose chase.<br> Wild goose chase nothing.<br> lt was one of the other boys' assignments,<br> and l just switched things around a little.<br> What kind of a heel<br> do you think l am, sugar?<br> But how will the editor ever know<br> that Ruth wrote it?<br> Maybe he won't,<br> but it's darn good experience for her.<br> You ought to be ashamed.<br> She was so excited.<br> How am l gonna tell her?<br> Now don't get tragic, Eleanor.<br> You get out of here.<br> Now, that's a silly attitude to take.<br> After all l tried to do for that sister of yours.<br> -Go away. Take your hands off me.<br> -Stop playing coy, sugar.<br> Stop it, please.<br> Come in.<br> Mr. Baker.<br> And now, Mr. Clark, will you please get out?<br> l think l'd do as the lady asks, Mr. Clark.<br> Sure, it's a little hot for wrestling anyway.<br> l look forward to the day when the Bronx<br> Express runs right through this room.<br> -Mr. Baker!<br> -There, there. You're all right.<br> l don't know what l'd have done without you.<br> Hey, hey, come on. Come and sit down.<br> There, that's a girl.<br> Everything is fine now, isn't it?<br> Yes, yes, thank you.<br> You came to see Ruth, didn't you?<br> Yes. Where is she?<br> That Chic Clark sent her on<br> a fake newspaper assignment to Brooklyn,<br> the sneak.<br> She's really having a bad day,<br> because your sister can write.<br> l always thought so,<br> but then she thinks l can act.<br> That's right, too.<br> Ruth told me you're an actress.<br> Yes, l want to be,<br> if l can ever get in a producer's office.<br> Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.<br> l'll see if l can arrange something.<br> lf you only could, but l wouldn't want you<br> to go to any trouble, Mr. Baker,<br> after you've taken such an interest in Ruth.<br> Well, let's say l take an interest in the family.<br> Ruth was right, Mr. Baker. Why, you're<br> the nicest person l've met in New York, too.<br> And, you know, the things they say<br> about New York aren't true at all.<br> -Why, everybody has been just lovely to me.<br> -l think l can understand that.<br> -Can you, Bob?<br> -Sure, sure.<br> l'm sorry about what happened to you<br> and your job. Ruth told me all about it.<br> Yeah, isn't it great? Why, l haven't felt<br> so lighthearted since l was a kid.<br> Do you know what l had in mind<br> when l came calling today? A celebration.<br> -You mean with Ruth?<br> -Yes, but why not with both the Sherwoods?<br> Why, a Sherwood sister<br> on each arm would be swell.<br> What do you say to a theater<br> and a nightclub supper?<br> -Mr. Baker!<br> -Fine. Well, l'll pick you up at 8:00.<br> Look, you're sure you're okay?<br> l mean, you're not frightened<br> of being left alone?<br> -No, that won't happen again.<br> -Good. 8:00, then.<br> Goodbye.<br> Mr. Appopolous.<br> l suppose you know absolutely nothing<br> about this pawn ticket<br> and how it was sub-rosa slipped<br> under my door?<br> Pawn ticket?<br> ''One gilt frame. $1 .25.''<br> Yes, for my painting, nothing.<br> Morons. Philistines!<br> You're absolutely right, Mr. Appopolous,<br> but what does a pawn broker know<br> about art, especially yours?<br> That is true. l am a fool to get excited.<br> ln the whole world, not more<br> than 15 people know what l am trying to say.<br> And you, my dear Miss Sherwood,<br> are one of them.<br> Yes, yes, naturally.<br> You know something?<br> As tenant to landlord,<br> we have had our differences,<br> but as person to person,<br> l think we could understand each other.<br> What? You, too?<br> Miss Sherwood. Eileen.<br> You are a both beautiful<br> and desirable young lady.<br> From the first night you came here,<br> l admired you,<br> not only for your charming build<br> and wholesome personality...<br> Yeah, well, we'll talk it over sometime.<br> Women have never played a disturbing role<br> in my life.<br> l am creative enough without women.<br> l can express myself.<br> Please, Miss Sherwood,<br> stand still while l am talking to you.<br> Mr. Appopolous, l must ask you to leave.<br> Leave at a time like this?<br> This is against the law.<br> You've got to leave<br> when another person tells you to.<br> There is a higher law, the law of the jungle.<br> -You struck me!<br> -You bet l struck you,<br> and if you don't get out of here,<br> l'm gonna call the police.<br> l assure you, my dear young lady,<br> that will not be necessary.<br> l should have known better. Life is for idiots.<br> A man like me in this position, believe me,<br> the gods must be laughing, indeed.<br> Eileen! Eileen!<br> -What's the matter?<br> -The fleet is in.<br> Well, for heaven's sake.<br> How do you do, gentlemen?<br> Listen, Emily Post, how do you say,<br> ''Get the dickens out of here,''<br> in Portuguese?<br> You mean they don't speak<br> any English at all?<br> Not a word.<br> Go.<br> Leave. Goodbye.<br> -What did you bring them here for?<br> -Bring them?<br> They've been on my tail<br> ever since l left the Brooklyn docks.<br> There were half a dozen more of them<br> when we started,<br> but they got lost in the subway.<br> -What do they want anyway?<br> -What do you think they want?<br> -We've gotta get them out of here.<br> -Suppose you take a crack at it.<br> Go away. Go away, boys, please.<br> Look, boys, go back to your boat.<br> You know, boat.<br> Admiral Sherwood, l presume.<br> What are we going to do?<br> Well, l guess we're gonna just stand here<br> grinning at each other<br> until they learn to speak English.<br> Look, boys, l have a date.<br> You know, eat. Eat.<br> Don't do that. They think you're asking them<br> to stay to dinner.<br> Sick, sick, very sick, very sick.<br> -What are they tossing for?<br> -l got a hunch it's not me.<br> No, l don't know what you want.<br> Earthquake, earthquake! Run for your lives!<br> What a performance.<br> Bernhardt couldn't have done better.<br> Well, stop grinning at me like that.<br> Ruth, Ruth!<br> l don't even do the rumba.<br> Ruth!<br> Ruth!<br> Ruth!<br> Cut it out, will you?<br> Take it easy, will you?<br> Ruth!<br> Eileen! Hey, Eileen!<br> Eileen, l got an idea.<br> Lead them out the back door,<br> then run like mad for the front,<br> and l'll slip you in. Come on.<br> You lead them and l'll let you slip in.<br> They won't follow me. lt's you they want.<br> Come on.<br> You'd better be there.<br> What are you doing? Get rid of them.<br> l got the door fixed.<br> All right.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Stop! You're breaking the law!<br> But, Sergeant, that's just an innocent girl<br> from Columbus, Ohio.<br> She's never seen a jail in her life.<br> This will positively kill her.<br> Why don't you put me in there?<br> l started the whole thing.<br> She was leading the riot.<br> Yes, l know, but let me see her,<br> will you, please?<br> She must be scared to death in there.<br> She must be half out of her mind.<br> -Okay, Ed.<br> -Thank you.<br> Come on now, Eileen, open your mouth.<br> Don't you do it, Eileen.<br> Don't say a word till we get a lawyer.<br> Why, Ruth.<br> -Hello.<br> -What are they doing to you, darling?<br> Feeding me ice cream.<br> lsn't that nice of the boys?<br> Boys, meet my sister, Ruth.<br> Ruth this is Mr. Murphy, Mr. Jackson,<br> Mr. Griswald.<br> -Hiya, Ruth.<br> -Hiya, Ruth.<br> -Have some ice cream?<br> -No. No, thank you.<br> -Say, Murphy, could l step in the corridor?<br> -Why, certainly.<br> -Give me the keys, Murph.<br> -Yeah, where are the keys?<br> Go way.

Hold this.<br> There we are.<br> You know, Ruth,<br> policemen aren't frightening at all.<br> ln fact, they're just about the nicest men<br> l ever met.<br> Eileen, you're sure you're all right?<br> All right? Well, of course.<br> Ruth, isn't it fascinating?<br> Just think, Eileen Sherwood in jail.<br> l was just telling the boys...<br> You know, for an actress,<br> this is very valuable experience.<br> Of course,<br> we didn't have enough experience.<br> -Ruth.<br> -Mr. Baker.<br> Bob, it was terribly nice of you to come.<br> Not at all. Came as fast as l could, Ruth.<br> Why, l didn't know you knew Eileen.<br> Well, he certainly does.<br> We had a delightful talk this afternoon.<br> -Yes.<br> -We were all going out to dinner, you know.<br> Bob, l want you to meet the boys. Come on.<br> Bob, this is Mr. Murphy, Mr. Griswald<br> and Mr. Jackson.<br> -Hiya.<br> -Hi.<br> Hello, boys.<br> Look, Eileen, l don't want you to worry,<br> but l'm afraid the news is not too good.<br> l did some phoning about this,<br> and it seems there are peculiar ramifications.<br> What kind of ramifications?<br> Well, it seems<br> that Washington wants Eileen held.<br> -Washington?<br> -DC?<br> Yes, something about foreign relations,<br> the Portuguese merchant marine.<br> Oh, my gosh. What if Dad hears about this?<br> We've got to get a lawyer.<br> No, it's only a technicality.<br> l'm sure they'll iron it out in a few hours,<br> but l'm afraid Eileen has to spend<br> the night in jail.<br> -The night?<br> -Well, what do you know?<br> -That's terrific.<br> -That's fine.<br> No, she can't do that.<br> Darling, this is horrible for you.<br> Well, now, Ruth, if l have to, l have to.<br> Don't worry, Ruth, we'll get her out of here<br> first thing in the morning.<br> -Sure, everything is gonna be fine.<br> -We'll take care of her.<br> Now, darling, l'm going to be nice<br> and comfortable here. You run along.<br> And thank you, Bob,<br> for everything you've done.<br> -l will see you in the morning, won't l?<br> -Yes, yes, of course.<br> -Good night, Ruth, dear.<br> -Good night, darling.<br> Well, boys, you can lock me up now.<br> Come on, Ruth. We better go.<br> Ruth, l'm sorry l can't see you home,<br> but l got something very important<br> to do at the office.<br> Here, you take my cab.<br> l'll tell you all about it tomorrow.<br> Well, thank you and good night.<br> -Good night. Don't you worry now.<br> -l won't.<br> -l am a fool, Jenson, a fool.<br> -Yes, Mr. Appopolous.<br> That is my last exhibit.<br> lmagine, nobody came, even with a sign<br> in the window, ''Free ice tea.''<br> A hundred years from now,<br> the world will catch up with me.<br> Yes, Mr. Appopolous.<br> -See if you can fix the back door lock.<br> -Yes, Mr. Appopolous.<br> So you finally returned<br> to the scene of your crime.<br> Don't you start, Appopolous. l'm in no mood<br> to swap subtleties with you.<br> Not so high and haughty,<br> my dear young lady.<br> l've rented this apartment for 1 2 years<br> to a lot of peculiar tenants,<br> but none of them ever started a riot<br> with the whole European continent before.<br> -Please, l'm tired.<br> -Arrests, jails.<br> l only hope your sister had sense enough<br> to give the wrong address.<br> Yeah, imagine what bad publicity<br> could do to this rat hole.<br> What's that?<br> l am fixing the back door lock<br> for the next tenant.<br> Well, that's fine.<br> lt makes this studio a dead-end street.<br> Well, listen, l don't hold grudges.<br> lf you got some money, and you want<br> to stay on here, l'm ready to talk business.<br> You are? All right,<br> how about returning our month's rent?<br> We're still dissatisfied.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Whoever said such a thing?<br> l was one of the witnesses,<br> and l don't remember.<br> Okay, witness, blow.<br> Me? Blow? ln my own building?<br> Yeah, blow in your own building.<br> Very well, l will blow,<br> but 5:00 tomorrow<br> when your current lease expires,<br> l am blowing back again.<br> Your slip is showing.<br> Yeah, this is the place, Mother.<br> What the... Take it off, please.<br> -Grandma. Dad. Dad, darling.<br> -Ruth.<br> Well, why didn't you let us know<br> you were coming?<br> What are you doing here anyway?<br> Well, l tried to get this man to stay at home<br> and mind his own business,<br> but he had to come.<br> He's been worrying like a fool.<br> -Worried? Worried about what, Dad?<br> -You know your father.<br> -ls this where you live?<br> -What's wrong with it?<br> -lt's lovely, isn't it, Grandma?<br> -Yes.<br> The atmosphere in Greenwich Village...<br> You have no idea.<br> -Where's Eileen?<br> -Eileen? Out for the day already.<br> -Eileen, at 10:00, out for the day?<br> -Doing what?<br> Did you ever see<br> such a clucking old mother hen as he is?<br> -Now, what is she doing?<br> -Well, you know, she... Nothing.<br> l meant that she's, you know, keeping up<br> friendships and making contacts, and...<br> Where is... Thank you.<br> -Ruth!<br> -Gee, Dad, you look great.<br> Why is it you never wrote<br> about anything definite?<br> Well, you see, darling, it takes time.<br> l've sent in a lot of material,<br> one story in particular.<br> l feel sure they'll publish it.<br> But what about money?<br> Have you earned any?<br> -Why, if not, you can't have a cent left.<br> -Sure.<br> -Hello there.<br> -Good morning, Officer.<br> Nice and quiet around here today so far.<br> Officer, this is my father.<br> Well, thanks very much for looking in.<br> Don't mention it.<br> So long, Daddy.<br> What's all this about?<br> Hiya, Ruth.<br> -Wreck, couldn't you come back later?<br> -There ain't going to be no later.<br> Helen and l are just leaving<br> on our honeymoon.<br> Honeymoon?<br> Mother said her daughter couldn't<br> get married without her being present,<br> so we had to be married all over again.<br> Yeah, we were in kind of a tough spot.<br> l had to kick out behind my own goal post.<br> Well, so long, baby. We'll be seeing you.<br> Come on, sugar foot.<br> Ruth, l want you to know how sorry l am<br> for the way l acted.<br> That's all right. Run right along.<br> Have a good time.<br> l mean for all the things l said<br> while the Wreck was living down here.<br> -Living down where?<br> -Down here.<br> Well, here goes the bridal bouquet.<br> Who's gonna be next?<br> April fool.<br> Hey, Ruth, bring your pals up later<br> for a couple of snorts.<br> There may be some people dropping in here.<br> lt looked like some kind of a parade.<br> Well, they're people we met yesterday<br> under rather unusual circumstances.<br> Dad, Grandma!<br> Eileen, how did... What happened?<br> May l present Captain Amadato<br> of the Portuguese merchant marine<br> and his cadets?<br> l am honored. l have come to right<br> a most disastrous wrong.<br> -What?<br> -That's quite all right. Don't mention it.<br> They say they are grossly sorry.<br> As for myself, l will take up at once<br> with the merchant marine<br> the question of reparation.<br> -Reparations?<br> -We wouldn't think of it. Thanks.<br> But she has spent the night in jail.<br> -Jail?<br> -What?<br> And now, in grateful token,<br> l present to you the ribbon<br> of the Society of Mariners, second class.<br> l wonder what you have to go through<br> to get first class.<br> l beg your pardon, is it here that<br> these careless boys have lost their hats?<br> This is the place. Six caps coming up.<br> For the merchant marine from<br> your good neighbors in Greenwich Village.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello!<br> Dad, you'll just die laughing<br> when you hear what this is all about.<br> Yes, l'm sure he will.<br> Now, Walter, Walter, get hold of yourself.<br> Dad, it isn't as bad as it sounds, honestly.<br> Don't bother, Ruth.<br> You girls are coming home with me tonight.<br> -Home?<br> -l can explain the whole thing.<br> You can make your explanations<br> on the way back to Columbus.<br> -l'm going to get the bus tickets.<br> -Dad.<br> l'll be right back,<br> and l want you to be ready to go.<br> Walter, it's well known you're a dodo.<br> Mother, l've heard the last from you<br> or any of you,<br> and so you don't stay here and make<br> trouble, you're coming along with me.<br> Why, Walter, l'm your mother. Let go of me.<br> -Walter, you're just an old dodo.<br> -Well, there you are.<br> Old dodo.<br> Well, we might as well start packing.<br> Dad will be here any minute.<br> -l'm not going back.<br> -You're not?<br> lt isn't fair, not when things are<br> just beginning to happen.<br> You're right, Ruth.<br> Why, l just started to know people.<br> l'd have had a job in a week.<br> Well, two weeks at the most.<br> Why, l began to feel l could really write.<br> lt's true, the darn stuff didn't click,<br> but for the first time,<br> l was sure l could fight it through.<br> l felt strong and confident.<br> Ruth, l want a career.<br> l may never feel this way again<br> as long as l live.<br> And if we go back to Columbus,<br> what will people say?<br> l'll tell you what they'll say.<br> They'll say, ''Did you hear the dirt<br> about the Sherwood girls?<br> ''On account of them,<br> we nearly had international complications.''<br> -lt's awful.<br> -Ghastly!<br> No! We won't go back.<br> We'll stay right here and fight it out.<br> Won't we, Ruth?<br> -Let's start packing, Eileen.<br> -Packing?<br> Well, didn't you just say<br> that you felt strong and confident?<br> Yes, yes, l said it, but what's the use?<br> We were licked before we started.<br> Well, what did you have<br> to get me all worked up for?<br> l had to get it off my chest, didn't l?<br> Well, it's horrible.<br> That's what it is, just horrible.<br> And after meeting the nicest person<br> we've ever met in our lives,<br> and the first person who really seemed<br> to care what happened to my career.<br> -Mr. Baker?<br> -Yes, Bob Baker.<br> Now, how am l going to call him up and say,<br> ''Father is bundling me off home''?<br> Well, it really doesn't make<br> any difference, Eileen.<br> We didn't get to know him too well.<br> -What?<br> -l said...<br> l said, we've got to go home,<br> so it doesn't matter now.<br> Why, Ruth, l never dreamed.<br> You like him, too.<br> -Strange as it may seem.<br> -Why, l never had any idea.<br> And me, that's had no experience with men.<br> That's bad, isn't it?<br> lt's ridiculous. l'm just a goop.<br> Eileen, start packing.<br> Dad said he'd be back any minute.<br> Now, there, you see? Yes?<br> -Hello, Bob.<br> -Hello, Sherwoods.<br> -Packing? Why, what does this mean?<br> -We're going home.<br> Yes, Father came.<br> He wants us to go back for a little while.<br> Yes, but wait a minute.<br> When are you coming back?<br> l don't think we'll ever be back.<br> We're going home because<br> we're a couple of flat-broke failures.<br> -Ruth.<br> -As a matter of fact, if Dad hadn't shown up,<br> l guess we'd have had<br> to thumb our way back to Columbus.<br> -Now, that can't be true.<br> -Oh, no?<br> l've got 3 extra pounds to prove it<br> from eating potatoes and spaghetti.<br> We can't even buy that much now.<br> Well, you can buy a lot of spaghetti for $250.<br> This check seems to be yours.<br> lt has your name on it.<br> $250.<br> lt's much too early in life<br> to begin accepting charity, Mr. Baker.<br> We won't take it. That's all there is to it.<br> Thank you very much.<br> l get it. You're gonna read page 15<br> of this new issue of The Manhatter,<br> and you're gonna hold us up?<br> l suppose you're going to sue us<br> for almost $1 million.<br> Page 15? What's on it?<br> '''My Sister Eileen,' by Ruth Sherwood.''<br> ''My Sister...'' Why, that's me. That's me!<br> Very clever, Miss Sherwood. Very clever.<br> This was printed without your permission,<br> so you've got me over a barrel.<br> Well, come on, what'll you settle for,<br> Why, Ruth, that's your story.<br> That's your money.<br> No, Bob, we wouldn't sue.<br> Why, $250 is just fine.<br> -Well, how did it happen?<br> -How do you think it happened?<br> And if you want to know, several people<br> have already phoned me to say<br> that they consider this is<br> the best human interest story of the year.<br> Bob, and it's all about me.<br> You are, by far and away, the best thing<br> in it. l hope you don't mind, Eileen.<br> Mind? Why, l'm famous.<br> Now, come on,<br> are you going to accept this check,<br> -or am l going to have trouble with you?<br> -We'll accept it.<br> Where the dickens is 233 Barrow Street?<br> How do you get into the place?<br> -That sounds like Mr. Craven.<br> -Here we go.<br> Where does that Sherwood girl live<br> around here anyway?<br> -Why, Mr. Craven.<br> -What? What do you want?<br> There you are. Who put this story in? You?<br> Yes. What about it?<br> l wanna talk to you, and to you,<br> Miss Columbus. l'll be right down.<br> -How do l get into the place?<br> -You stay where you are.<br> The lady doesn't want to see you.<br> l'll be right up.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> My dear young ladies,<br> Jenson just told me the sensational news.<br> l will not hear of your leaving.<br> Why, l'm sure<br> we can reach an understanding.<br> l'm sure you think so now, Mr. Appopolous.<br> But in the future, we certainly won't be living<br> in a place where there are explosions<br> under the beds.<br> But wait. The blasting is over.<br> l just got a letter from the city.<br> Dreadfully sorry, Mr. Appopolous, but<br> somewhere uptown. A penthouse, perhaps.<br> Eileen, wait a minute.<br> What on earth are you talking about?<br> Well, darling, we're certainly<br> not gonna go back home now.<br> Well, l guess we aren't,<br> but what's all this uptown talk about?<br> What do you think we're going to do?<br> Spend a check for a month's rent<br> on a penthouse and then sit around<br> on a bare floor and starve?<br> -Exactly.<br> -Who asked you?<br> -Eileen, we've got to be sensible, dear.<br> -By all means.<br> -Did you say the blasting is really over?<br> -ln black and white.<br> ''Please note, blasting will terminate<br> on September the first.'' Today.<br> And you're fixing this place up?<br> New furniture, new paint, A-1 stoves<br> and plumbings, Venetian blinds!<br> Venetian blinds.<br> Why, Ruth, that sounds wonderful.<br> And you know,<br> this place has been awfully lucky.<br> Yes, dear, l know,<br> but let's talk it over with Mr. Baker.<br> He'll be right back.<br> And, listen, rent is reduced to $30 a month.<br> -Ruth, did you hear that?<br> -$30?<br> But at that figure, my dear ladies,<br> it must be a six-month lease.<br> -On a completely friendly basis.<br> -l think we ought to do it.<br> Certainly you ought to do it.<br> How do you know<br> he's gonna do what he says?<br> -lt's in the lease.<br> -There, you see?<br> Please, Ruth. He can't back out.<br> We've got him where we want him.<br> Absolutely. l'm trapped.<br> Well...<br> Congratulations, young lady.<br> You have made a very wise decision.<br> Aren't you ready yet, girls?<br> The bus leaves in 40 minutes.<br> Dad, we're not going.<br> -What?<br> -lt's true.<br> Ruth sold a story.<br> Look, we're famous, both of us.<br> -l don't believe it.<br> -Congratulations, Mr. Sherwood.<br> You have a pair of brilliant daughters.<br> l am proud to have them as tenants<br> for the next six months.<br> Six months? Here? What does this mean?<br> lt's all settled, Dad.<br> We've just signed the lease.<br> Yes, thank you. Goodbye, everybody.<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> -What's that?<br> -l told you the blasting is over.<br> -Now, they are starting to drill. Goodbye.<br> -You cheat.<br> Now, l'm convinced.<br> You girls have gone crazy.<br> That settles it.<br> You're coming right back to Columbus.<br> Who's going back to Columbus?<br> Not Ruth Sherwood.<br> What's that?<br> Ruth, since this morning,<br> Mr. Craven has decided<br> that there is room in his publication<br> for some human material,<br> and l have a contract here for all the future<br> Eileen stories you'll ever write.<br> Ruth! And believe me, Mr. Craven,<br> the Eileen stories will go on forever.<br> Why, l've got loads of material.<br> l'll guarantee that.<br> -And who are you?<br> -Why, l'm My Sister Eileen.<br> Why, Grandma.<br> l'd have known you anywhere.<br> -l'm very glad to see you.<br> -Thank you.<br> And this must be Mr. Sherwood.<br> lt's a great pleasure, sir.<br> Now, see here, what's happening here?<br> Look, l've made up mind.<br> No, no, sir, you can't take Ruth<br> back to Columbus now.<br> Why, don't you see? She and l have<br> a lot of work to do together.<br> lt may take years,<br> maybe even a lifetime to finish.<br> l wonder if you understand, Mr. Sherwood.<br> A lifetime.<br> lt's getting pretty clear to me.<br> Well, in any case,<br> certainly Eileen is coming home.<br> No, no, Dad, she isn't.<br> lf l stay, Eileen stays, too.<br> She has a career, you know.<br> ln fact, Mr. Craven must know a lot of people<br> in the theatrical world.<br> Of course he does.<br> Well then, if he'll help Eileen get a start,<br> l may sign this contract very soon.<br> l don't see why not.<br> lt's obvious the young lady has<br> extraordinary talent.<br> Why, Mr. Craven,<br> you're the nicest man l ever met.<br> Well, this makes it just perfect.<br> We ought to celebrate.<br> -Will you all be my guests for dinner?<br> -Now you're talking, young man.<br> -But no spaghetti.<br> -Positively not.<br> -Hold on, Mother, not so fast.<br> -Walter, be still.<br> -Come on, let's go.<br> -Well, l'll take Mr. Craven.<br> -And you've got me, Walter.<br> -And l'll take Ruth.<br> Eileen.<br> Hey, Moe, l think l made the wrong turn.<br>
