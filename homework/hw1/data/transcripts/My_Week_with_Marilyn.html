                        When love goes wrong<br> Nothing goes right<br> This one thing I know<br> When love goes wrong<br> A man takes ight<br> And women get uppity-oh<br> We're having a heat wave<br> A tropical heat wave<br> The temperature's rising<br> It isn't surprising<br> You certainly can<br> I started this heat wave<br> By letting my seat wave<br> And in such a way that<br> The customers say that<br> I certainly can<br> Can-can<br> We're having a heat wave<br> A tropical heat wave<br> The way that I move<br> that thermometer proves<br> That I certainly can<br> Can <br> Everyone remembers<br> their first job.<br> This is the story of mine.<br> I was the youngest<br> in a family of overachievers.<br> My father was a world-famous<br> art historian,<br> and my brother was ahead<br> of me in everything.<br> I was always the disappointment.<br> I found my solace in the small cinema<br> I went to every Thursday night.<br> Alfred Hitchcock. Orson Welles.<br> Laurence Olivier.<br> These were my heroes.<br> I wanted to be a pan'<br> of their world.<br> When I was 23, I got my chance.<br> Colin, come in.<br> Have you met James and Anna,<br> - my two very brilliant pupils?<br> - Hello.<br> - I'm off to London now, Pa.<br> - Your silly job interview.<br> Well, bonne chance, dear boy.<br> I can always get you<br> a research position at the V&A<br> once you've grown up a bit and got this<br> film idea out of your system.<br> - So I'm off now, Ma.<br> - Off?<br> - My job interview, Mother.<br> - Oh! Can't you stay for dinner?<br> There's nothing to eat, but I'm sure<br> the conversation will be charming.<br> I don't want to be late in the morning.<br> I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be<br> a famous film director in no time.<br> I had everything to prove to my<br> family, but more to prove to myself.<br> Like every young man,<br> I had to make my own way.<br> - So I decided to leave home<br> and join the circus.<br> - What do you want?<br> - A job on your next film.<br> You're an actor, aren't you?<br> No, I want to work<br> on the production side.<br> We don't start shooting<br> for another eight weeks.<br> - Come back nearer the time.<br> - May I wait until there's a job?<br> Vanessa!<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> There are no jobs.<br> I'll come back tomorrow<br> morning just in case.<br> It's a free country.<br> - Good morning.<br> - You're very determined.<br> Well, I'd do anything<br> to be in the film business.<br> - Anything?<br> Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.<br> No, I'm afraid he's at Notley<br> till the end of the week.<br> - Vanessa asked me to...<br> - Oh, did she?<br> I need a number for Noel Coward.<br> It won't be in the book.<br> Hello, Vivien.<br> - Hello.<br> - Sir Laurence.<br> - Hughie!<br> Simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe<br> on the telephone.<br> The darling girl spends<br> the entire day asleep.<br> - Hello, boy. Remind me.<br> - Darling, you remember Colin.<br> - You met him at the Clark's party.<br> - Of course. What are you doing here?<br> You said there might be a job<br> on your film.<br> Have a cigarette.<br> Keep the pack.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> There won't be a film unless Miss Monroe<br> gets her splendid posterior out of bed.<br> The house committee is threatening<br> to withhold Miller's passport.<br> They say he's a communist.<br> No Arthur, no Marilyn.<br> I'll have a word with<br> the American ambassador.<br> I'm taking him to see Vivien's play on<br> Thursday. Terry's rewrites, are they in?<br> Not all of them, of course.<br> When did that ever happen?<br> He's the first actor since du Maurier<br> to have his own brand.<br> They pay him an absolute fortune.<br> I'm afraid they're rather ghastly.<br> - Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?<br> I suppose he's all right.<br> Darling, you must do something for<br> Colin. You absolutely promised.<br> Hughie, let's try to<br> find him something to do.<br> - Yes. Of course.<br> - Come on, darling.<br> You'll look after my precious<br> Larrykins, won't you?<br> Come on, darling.<br> - Christ.<br> Do you like it?<br> That's<br> absolutely splendid.<br> - You were absolutely born for it.<br> - Door.<br> - Sorry.<br> And could you turn<br> all the way around, my darling?<br> - Thank you.<br> - This is the dress Larry likes.<br> - There?<br> - The camera's ravishing you.<br> Oh, dear.<br> That sounds serious.<br> That's wonderful.<br> - Too much?<br> Oh, God. Not for me.<br> - Arthur Jacobs,<br> Miss Monroe's publicist,<br> is flying in tomorrow.<br> He wants to see the house<br> where she'll be staying.<br> Find something suitable.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - More importantly,<br> - how does it make you feel?<br> - And leave the bloody tea.<br> - Oh. Sorry.<br> Out of the question. I can't have<br> a lot of awful film people traveling<br> - through the house in dirty boots.<br> - But we'd be paying<br> a hundred pounds per week<br> for 18 weeks.<br> - My wife would never agree.<br> - That's a pity, Mr. Cotes-Preedy.<br> I'll have to tell Miss Monroe<br> to look elsewhere, then.<br> - Marilyn Monroe?<br> - Yes.<br> Suppose I'd have to be introduced.<br> Good morning, Mr. Jacobs.<br> Hope you had a pleasant flight.<br> Is this the fucking car?<br> Who built this place?<br> Hansel and Gretel?<br> It's one of the best houses<br> in the area.<br> All right. We'll take it.<br> But ditch the wallpaper.<br> It's giving me a migraine.<br> That house was perfect for Marilyn.<br> - Can't use it now.<br> - Yes, we can.<br> I knew that Cotes-Preedy<br> wouldn't be able to keep this quiet,<br> so that's why when you asked me<br> to find a house for Miss Monroe,<br> I took the precaution of finding two.<br> So the other one, Parkside,<br> is much better.<br> And the owner is very discreet.<br> So we've got two expensive houses now<br> where we only needed one.<br> I thought that someone else<br> on the production might want it.<br> Oh, did you?<br> I guess Milton could use it<br> and it's near the studio. Near Marilyn.<br> What are we paying you, boy?<br> - Nothing, sir.<br> - Let's see to it, Hughie.<br> Well done, boy.<br> Nice job, kid.<br> Colin Clark,<br> Laurence Olivier Productions.<br> The film was then<br> called The Sleeping Prince.<br> Marilyn was to play a naive American<br> showgirl called Elsie Marina<br> who is seduced by an Eastern-European<br> prince played by Olivier.<br> It was the lightest of comedies.<br> - You in the union?<br> - No.<br> Then you can't have a job on the film.<br> Well, how do I get into the union?<br> By getting a job on the film.<br> It's called a closed shop.<br> I suppose I might be able<br> to do something for you.<br> The union owe me a few favors.<br> We don't have a third yet.<br> - A third?<br> - Third assistant director.<br> - You do know what the job is?<br> - Assisting the director?<br> That's the last thing you do!<br> thirds job is to<br> do whatever the fuck I tell him.<br> - And what are you waiting for?<br> Colin!<br> don't shit<br> on your own doorstep.<br> - Got it?<br> - Got it.<br> The third always stays nearby.<br> Not in some bloody palace in London.<br> Book a room at<br> The Dog & Duck down the road.<br> It's a bit rough. You'll get used to it.<br> Now make yourself useful.<br> Marilyn needs a bodyguard.<br> - Sort something out.<br> I'm sure you understand the sensitive<br> nature of the job, Superintendent.<br> Something about looking<br> after a cinema actress?<br> Well, not just any actress.<br> Marilyn Monroe.<br> I never had much time<br> for the pictures.<br> Excellent.<br> For the next four months,<br> you never leave her side.<br> Day or night.<br> Her behavior is reputedly<br> a little erratic.<br> - She drinks?<br> - Amongst other things.<br> - Pills?<br> - It would be useful if you could, uh,<br> keep us informed of<br> her domestic situation.<br> You want me to spy on her.<br> Well, the odd early warning<br> if you know she's going to be late.<br> That kind of thing.<br> Hello.<br> Colin Clark. I booked a room.<br> Ah, right. Here you are.<br> Sign this.<br> What brings you up this way?<br> I'm working on a film at Pinewood.<br> Oh. What film is that?<br> It's called The Sleeping Prince. With<br> Sir Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe,<br> so I'll be working with them.<br> Room's three quid a week.<br> First week in advance.<br> Number two.<br> And, uh, hope you don't mind,<br> you'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.<br> This'll work fine for Marilyn. Oh, and,<br> uh, Paula will need the room next door.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Sorry, who is Paula?<br> Strasberg. Marilyn's acting coach.<br> She's nuts about the Method.<br> Arthur, we've spoken about this before.<br> Stanislavski and the Method are<br> perfectly fine in the rehearsal room,<br> but they don't belong on a film set.<br> Time is too tight.<br> Larry! Some good news.<br> House committee have decided<br> Miller isn't a communist after all.<br> Of course he is.<br> All those pain in the ass<br> New York intellectuals are Reds.<br> Which means she'll be flying<br> in next week on schedule.<br> - Excellent news.<br> - She'll have to be met.<br> Well, naturally Vivien and I<br> will be there to greet her,<br> but let's keep it low key, shall we?<br> - You join us here at London Airport,<br> where it is absolute mayhem.<br> Marilyn! This way! Get out of the way!<br> With her is her new husband,<br> America's most celebrated playwright<br> and author of Death of a Salesman,<br> Arthur Miller.<br> Beautiful. You're looking at<br> tomorrow's front page, boys.<br> - We'll have to get them into the hall.<br> - Sir Laurence Olivier<br> and Scarlett O'Hara herself,<br> Vivien Leigh, are set to greet them.<br> American acting royalty<br> meeting British acting royalty.<br> Gentlemen, it is my especial pleasure<br> to introduce a woman<br> who clearly needs no introduction.<br> Marilyn! How do you like being married?<br> Well, I like it. I like it a lot.<br> - Is this third time lucky?<br> - You bet it is.<br> Is it true you want to be<br> a classical actress now?<br> Well, I want to be<br> the best actress I can be.<br> There's a rumor you're going to be in<br> The Brothers Karamazov, on Broadway.<br> Ooh.<br> I'm... considering it.<br> Which of them will you be playing?<br> I'll be playing Grushenka.<br> - Can you spell that?<br> - Sure. Can you?<br> Vivien, you created<br> the role of Elsie on stage.<br> Have you any advice for Marilyn?<br> I am sure if Miss Monroe<br> needs any advice,<br> she'll get it from her director.<br> - I hear he's terribly good.<br> - Marilyn!<br> Are you happy with your last film?<br> Marilyn!<br> Is it true you wear nothing<br> in bed except perfume?<br> - Ooh.<br> Darling, as I'm in England, let's say I<br> sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender.<br> Smile, Marilyn!<br> OK, let's get a snap of the newlyweds.<br> Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad.<br> This is some place you found.<br> You have my new assistant<br> Colin to thank for that.<br> Colin, this is Milton Greene.<br> You must be very nice to him.<br> He owns half of<br> Marilyn Monroe Productions.<br> - Forty-nine percent, Larry.<br> - Have a cigarette.<br> - I don't smoke.<br> - Really?<br> - And the studio, they want a new title.<br> - Nonsense.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Marvelous, isn't she?<br> - She's all right.<br> - Larry fell desperately<br> in love with her in New York.<br> He's determined to seduce her.<br> Yeah, but she's only<br> been married three weeks.<br> I thought you were a man of the world.<br> Of course, Larry would never leave me,<br> but if anything were to happen<br> you would tell me, wouldn't you?<br> - I'm sure he loves you very much.<br> - Oh, don't be such a boy.<br> I'm 43, darling.<br> No one will love me for very much<br> longer. Not even you.<br> What a wonderful adventure,<br> Dame Sybil.<br> Such a lark.<br> I long to see her.<br> - Miss Monroe?<br> Sir Laurence sends his compliments.<br> He's ready for the read-through.<br> But Marilyn is not ready.<br> She's preparing.<br> Excuse my horrible face.<br> Ah! Marilyn, my dear.<br> Everyone is so excited to meet you.<br> Do... Come along, my darling, my angel.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> Miss Marilyn Monroe.<br> Marilyn.<br> - How lovely you are.<br> - Here, I kept a place for you.<br> - I have to be next to Marilyn.<br> What a good idea.<br> I wish we could all bring a friend.<br> One does get so terribly nervous.<br> It's just like the first day<br> at school, isn't it?<br> So, welcome, dear Marilyn,<br> to our little fraternity.<br> We may seem a little strange<br> and, uh, quaint to you at first,<br> but I hope that in time,<br> you may come to find your<br> method in our madness.<br> So, my very noble<br> and approved good masters,<br> may we strive to create a work of art<br> that, led by your good graces,<br> will be cherished<br> as long as motion pictures<br> may be remembered.<br> Were you surprised<br> to get my invitation?<br> I'll say I was surprised.<br> I was so surprised, I couldn't<br> hardly think you meant me.<br> Oh, but of course I meant you.<br> I had your name most carefully<br> marked down in my program.<br> In matters of this kind,<br> I assure you I'm most methodical.<br> Who would you think I meant if not you?<br> Gee, Mr. Sir, I could just<br> listen to your accent all day.<br> - Oh, you darling, Marilyn.<br> You're amongst friends now.<br> Just plain "Larry" will suffice, really.<br> That's so sweet.<br> Um, whenever you're ready.<br> Well, Maisie Springfield.<br> No, not Maisie Springfield.<br> She is quite what<br> I would call "old hat."<br> Remember why you're<br> in the embassy, Marilyn.<br> What does the Grand Duke<br> want from Elsie?<br> You came here and you thought...<br> from experience, Marilyn.<br> It's only a read-through, Paula.<br> Marilyn has to begin<br> finding the character.<br> Oh, the character's on the page.<br> The words, maybe. Not the character.<br> Aren't we going to have fun?<br> Well, we'll pick it up<br> whenever you like.<br> We should talk. Just us.<br> - Yeah.<br> Thank you so much.<br> We can't have two fucking directors!<br> - Marilyn wants Paula.<br> - Why? She's got me.<br> Paula's costing us two and a half<br> thousand bucks a week.<br> We might as well use her.<br> Listen, Larry.<br> Accept Marilyn on her<br> own terms and you'll be OK.<br> Try to change her<br> and she will drive you crazy.<br> - Trust me.<br> - Christ, what have I got myself into?<br> - Come outwith me tonight.<br> - I'm working.<br> - Well, tomorrow night, then.<br> - I'm washing my hair.<br> - But your hair's lovely.<br> - Look, I've got two rules.<br> Everyone has a lot of rules around here.<br> One, never touch the talent,<br> and two, never go outwith thirds.<br> Why not?<br> Because they're all randy little buggers<br> who just want some fun during shooting.<br> I'm not like that.<br> Really.<br> I'm free on Saturday.<br> Colin!<br> Quiet on set, everyone!<br> How kind of you to meet us.<br> Dear me, you do look cold.<br> They're ready for you<br> in makeup, Dame Sybil.<br> How exciting. Don't you love<br> the first day of a new production?<br> I don't know, Dame Sybil.<br> I've never had one before.<br> Oh, to be young again.<br> She has kept Dame Sybil Thorndike<br> and the entire company<br> waiting in full costume<br> for two hours, Mr. Orton,<br> and it is simply not fair.<br> I can't do this.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - She's nervous.<br> I'll deal With it.<br> Would you like to sit down,<br> Dame Sybil?<br> Oh, yes. Colin, how kind.<br> - Why don't we all sit down.<br> - Oi!<br> That chair is a prop.<br> - Props are NATKE.<br> - But I was...<br> If ACTT members are gonna start doing<br> NATKE jobs, I'm calling my men out!<br> He's right.<br> - Right.<br> I'm sure we're all good<br> union members here.<br> There's no need to fall out<br> over something so trivial.<br> It might be trivial to you,<br> Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood!<br> Put the chair down. Now!<br> I rather think you've made your point.<br> Solidarity is the most<br> important thing here.<br> When unions fall out,<br> it's management that benefits.<br> If I see you doing a NATKE job again,<br> I will close this set down<br> quicker than you can blink.<br> - Dave!<br> - Yes?<br> Dame Sybil would like a chair.<br> Right. There you are.<br> I was on the picket lines<br> in 1926, you know.<br> Now that really was a strike.<br> We were all Bolsheviks then.<br> Ready. Camera running.<br> - Very quiet, everyone.<br> - Speed.<br> Five, take one.<br> Action.<br> Now, before you meet<br> my mother-in-law,<br> I must remind you she's a little vague<br> and can be very deaf on occasion.<br> My dear, such boredom.<br> The decorations hideous<br> and the music catastrophe.<br> Our friend, the ex-king<br> of Moravia, drove me home.<br> He's now called the Duke of Strelitz.<br> He cannot, of course,<br> go to the abbey tomorrow,<br> but he's most anxious you<br> should invite him to the room<br> you have taken at the Ritz for Nicky.<br> - Maud?<br> - Yes, ma'am?<br> There you are. I didn't see you. Give me<br> a glass of champagne I see over there.<br> - Olga Bosnia...<br> - Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?<br> Yes, my dear, of course.<br> I remember you well.<br> - Gee, I forgot my line.<br> - That's a cut.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - It's so easily done, isn't it?<br> I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there.<br> - Shall we have another go, Larry?<br> - Of course.<br> - Action.<br> Yes, my dear, of course.<br> - I remember you well.<br> - Oh, I'm quite sure you don't,<br> Your Royal...<br> I mean Your, uh, Imperial, uh...<br> Serene Majesty?<br> - What does she say?<br> She says she's flattered and compliments<br> you on your wonderful memory.<br> I'm in The Coconut<br> Girl at the Avenue.<br> Didn't I have a line somewhere there?<br> - Cut.<br> - Action.<br> - Sweetly pretty.<br> She should use more mascara.<br> When one is young,<br> one should use a lot of mascara.<br> When one is old,<br> one should use much more.<br> - What do you do, my dear?<br> - I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.<br> - Dear?<br> - She says she's an actress.<br> - Cut it there.<br> - Print.<br> - Check the gate.<br> - Gate's good.<br> - That was perfect, Marilyn.<br> You were Elsie to the life.<br> I wonder, could we practice<br> our lines together later?<br> You'd be doing me such a kindness.<br> At my great age,<br> it's just so hard to make them stick.<br> - Why don't you come for tea tomorrow.<br> - Can I?<br> - Sure.<br> She's impossible.<br> I should've cast Vivien.<br> If anyone can make her great,<br> it's you, sir.<br> Well let's just hope I'm as<br> brilliant as you think I am.<br> Now be a good boy<br> and keep an eye on her.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I can't<br> figure this stupid movie out.<br> You were wonderful, Marilyn. The<br> most gifted actress I have ever known.<br> - No.<br> - You were superb, Marilyn.<br> You were divine.<br> Have faith in your talent.<br> He was disappointed in me.<br> You are a great, great actress.<br> All my life, I have prayed for a great<br> actress I could help and guide.<br> - Oh!<br> - Like this, I prayed to God,<br> on my knees, and he has given me you.<br> You are that great actress, Marilyn.<br> Trust yourself.<br> Trust your talent.<br> - Come on, Paula, get up.<br> - No.<br> Not until you admit that you were great!<br> Oh!<br> - OK!<br> ' Yes!<br> - I guess I was.<br> - Of course you were.<br> - There you are. Sorry.<br> - Thank you.<br> You really were very good, Miss Monroe.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Uno<br> Dos<br> Tres<br> Uno<br> Dos<br> Tres <br> Are you sure you can afford all this?<br> It's fine.<br> Must be costing you a week's wages.<br> You are worth it.<br> You're not the average third, are you?<br> I'm not living off my parents,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> I want to make my own way.<br> Will you be signing<br> on your father's account, sir?<br> Um, no, I'm gonna pay cash.<br> - Thank you.<br> - There you are, sir.<br> I was always going to pay, you know.<br> 'Course you were.<br> Do you think Marilyn's beautiful?<br> - Not compared to you.<br> You don't have to try so hard<br> to be charming.<br> You're nice enough as it is.<br> Well, you could be.<br> Wait a while, crocodile.<br> But I really do like you, Lucy.<br> - Maybe. That's my dad.<br> Time to be thinking about bed,<br> darling. Early start tomorrow.<br> Sorry, Daddy. We're just going<br> over tomorrow's schedule.<br> Yes, I should be off, sir.<br> Uh, Colin Clark. Lovely<br> to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.<br> This is a great place you have here.<br> Do you know this part of the world?<br> Um, no. My family<br> are more country people.<br> Oh. Well, good night.<br> Good night.<br> - Next Saturday?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Good morning, Dame Sybil.<br> - Colin, dear.<br> I thought you looked cold<br> so I bought you this.<br> - Thank you, Dame Sybil.<br> - Film sets and rehearsal rooms<br> are coldest places on Earth.<br> She should be on time<br> like everyone else.<br> She's a star.<br> - I'm a fucking star.<br> She's the greatest<br> piece of ass on Earth.<br> With tits like that,<br> you make allowances.<br> - Marilyn, my darling,<br> you are an angel<br> and I kiss the hem of your garment,<br> but why can't you get here on<br> time for the love of fuck?!<br> Oh.<br> You have that word in England, too.<br> Marilyn has to prepare properly.<br> Acting isn't just a case<br> of putting on a costume or a false nose.<br> You must apologize to Dame Sybil.<br> Sybil?<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - My dear, you mustn't concern yourself.<br> A great actress like you has<br> many other things on her mind.<br> You think I'm a great actress?<br> None of the rest of us truly<br> know how to act for the camera,<br> but you do. It's a rare gift.<br> This poor girl hasn't had<br> your years of experience.<br> She's in a strange country<br> acting a strange part.<br> Now, are you helping or bullying?<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Before you meet my mother-in-law,<br> I must warn you she's a little vague<br> and can be very deaf on occasions.<br> Uh, two is good, Jack. Yeah.<br> OK, let's cut it there.<br> - Speed.<br> - Five, take one.<br> - OK.<br> - Action.<br> When one is old,<br> one should use much more.<br> - What do you do, my dear?<br> - I'm The Coconut...<br> And once again, please.<br> Keep rolling.<br> - I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.<br> - Excellent.<br> I do need you to keep your eyes<br> open if you can, my angel.<br> Paula, would you give<br> the line, please?<br> Wait, I know it.<br> I'm in The Coconut<br> Girl on the Avenue.<br> At the Avenue.<br> - I'm at the Avenue.<br> It's not at the Avenue.<br> Uh, Sybil, would you<br> give her the line again?<br> - Thank you.<br> - What do you do, my dear?<br> I'm in The Coconut<br> Girl at the Avenue.<br> That one's pretty damn good.<br> You knocked it outta the park.<br> She says she's an actress.<br> - When Marilyn gets it right,<br> you just don't wanna<br> look at anyone else.<br> Cut it there.<br> We've only been shooting for four days.<br> Already, we're two weeks behind.<br> So why not only show her the good takes.<br> She might feel better about herself.<br> Well, the kid's right.<br> She could use the confidence.<br> No one's forcing her to watch.<br> Besides, she's an experienced actress.<br> - She should learn from her mistakes.<br> - But they only upset her.<br> Not half so much as they upset me!<br> Leave all that.<br> Go and find Marilyn's script.<br> Paula thinks she's left it<br> in her dressing room.<br> Yes.<br> - Your script...<br> - Oh, I found it.<br> You can go now, Colin.<br> David wants to know if you're ready<br> for the extras in the ballroom scene.<br> Tell him he can start<br> sending them up. Women first.<br> I'm looking forward to Saturday.<br> - Our date.<br> - Oh, I completely forgot.<br> I can't do Saturday.<br> Marilyn wants to go shopping.<br> Since when do you work for her?<br> Next Friday instead.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah, I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock.<br> - Gee, it's quiet.<br> - Sure is.<br> It's a Saturday, so it's early closing,<br> but at least she can shop in peace.<br> That's awfully pretty.<br> Every building here looks like a castle.<br> Oh, I think so.<br> - Look.<br> - It's Marilyn!<br> - It's Marilyn Monroe!<br> - OK.<br> - It's her!<br> Slow down.<br> You'll get your autograph.<br> - Whoa!<br> - You're so kind!<br> - Boy, you're awfully excited.<br> - OK, guys, let's keep calm.<br> - Marilyn!<br> - Hold back a little.<br> - It's for my son.<br> Wait your turn!<br> - This is too much.<br> - Oh!<br> - Colin, get in the car!<br> Stand back a few feet, please.<br> Jeez, Marilyn, they really love you.<br> Well, we're still<br> the first ones, aren't we?<br> Gee, this is all right, isn't it?<br> Cut. Uh, the line is,<br> "Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?"<br> It's a tiny word, my darling,<br> but it does matter. So we'll...<br> We'll do it again. Once more, please,<br> straight away. Thank you so much.<br> - All right, as soon as we can.<br> - Turn over.<br> Well, we're still<br> the first ones, aren't we?<br> - Gee, this is all right, isn't it?<br> - Cut.<br> - Can't we just drop it?<br> - Well, the thing is, darling,<br> you've already admired the downstairs<br> hall in the earlier scene,<br> and now you're admiring<br> this room as well.<br> If you see what I mean?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Turn over.<br> - Paula?<br> Christ.<br> I don't get it.<br> He's such a strange man,<br> I think she's already figured out<br> that he only invited her here<br> to sleep with him.<br> I... What...<br> So, what is the...?<br> The reason Marilyn can't<br> remember the line<br> is because she doesn't believe<br> the situation her character is in.<br> Then she should pretend to believe it.<br> "Pretend"? We're talking<br> about the difference<br> between the truth and artificial crap.<br> We're in absolute agreement.<br> Acting is all about truth,<br> and if you can fake that,<br> you'll have a jolly good career.<br> Maybe we should try for another take.<br> Marilyn needs time<br> to give a great performance.<br> You should give her as long as it takes.<br> Chaplin took eight months<br> to make a movie.<br> Eight months of this?<br> - I'd rather kill myself.<br> - Oh!<br> I can't do this.<br> - I can't.<br> - Yes, you can. Yes, you can.<br> You can do it. You can't fail.<br> You'll have more pain,<br> you will suffer more,<br> but you will create.<br> All you need is time.<br> Think about the things<br> you like instead of him.<br> Frank Sinatra. Hmm?<br> Coca-Cola.<br> Use your substitutions<br> and make it work for you.<br> - OK.<br> - OK.<br> Two-eight-one, take 17.<br> Oh, we're still the first ones,<br> aren't we?<br> Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?<br> Then she goes...<br> She...<br> Cut! What is the matter now?<br> You wait! Marilyn, please.<br> Please, tell me how I can help you.<br> I don't know who Elsie is, and I can't<br> act her if I don't know who she is.<br> You have her precisely. You understand<br> her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift.<br> - We all are.<br> - She's not real.<br> Then why not simply rely<br> on your natural talents?<br> So are you saying you<br> don't want me to act?<br> Marilyn, will you just try to be sexy.<br> Isn't that what you do?<br> I want Lee.<br> I want Lee.<br> - You've already got Paula...<br> - I want Lee!<br> - I'm the director.<br> - I'm Lee's representative.<br> It's 5:00 in the morning in New York.<br> I want Lee!<br> Oh, now forever,<br> farewell the tranquil mind,<br> farewell content...<br> Farewell the plumed troops<br> and the big wars that make<br> ambition virtue. Oh, farewell!<br> Paula's not an actress!<br> She's not a director,<br> she's not a teacher!<br> Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn!<br> Larry, she needs her people.<br> We're the only family she's ever had.<br> Do you know what would make Marilyn<br> Monroe a real actor? A season in rep.<br> They wouldn't stand for this nonsense<br> at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.<br> Larry, you have to be patient with her.<br> Trying to teach Marilyn how to act<br> is like teaching Urdu to a badger!<br> I better go see her. She'll need<br> something to help her calm down.<br> Christ! Pills to sleep.<br> Pills to wake up.<br> Pills to calm her down.<br> Pills to give her energy.<br> No wonder she's permanently<br> ten feet underwater!<br> - Maybe she's scared.<br> - We're all scared!<br> I've spent half of my professional life<br> in abject bloody terror!<br> It's what actors do!<br> But you have the training<br> to deal with it, sir.<br> I wouldn't buy the "little<br> girl lost" act if I were you.<br> Though heaven knows, it's tempting.<br> I think Marilyn knows<br> exactly what she's doing.<br> Look, you better get over to Parkside<br> and make sure the poor girl's all right.<br> Marilyn's OK. She's taken<br> some pills and gone to bed.<br> They like to keep her doped up.<br> It makes her easier to control.<br> They're terrified their<br> cash cow will slip away.<br> - Cheers.<br> Why does everybody<br> always think I'm crazy?<br> I'm not crazy.<br> Marilyn, come back to bed.<br> It's not about you.<br> It's not what you think.<br> It's just a few ideas.<br> Writer stuff.<br> Come on, let's get some sleep<br> and bring back my book.<br> Don't touch me.<br> Good morning, Miss Monroe.<br> - It's nearly lunchtime.<br> - She's not feeling the part.<br> It's a light comedy. How much<br> feeling can it possibly require?<br> Just give her a few minutes, Larry.<br> Boy, will you find out what<br> the hell is going on, please?<br> It's Colin. Come in.<br> Are you all right, Miss Monroe?<br> - How old are you?<br> - Twenty-four.<br> Nearly. I'm... I'm 23.<br> I'm nearly 24.<br> Do you know you remind us of<br> the young king in the movie?<br> - And so...<br> uh ...sweet.<br> And innocent.<br> I'm not sure I'm that innocent.<br> So, what's your job on this picture?<br> I'm the third assistant director.<br> So, it's a gofer, really.<br> "Go for this, go for that."<br> But you're Larry's assistant, too.<br> Yes.<br> What were you doing<br> in my house last night?<br> Did he send you?<br> He was worried about you.<br> Are you spying on me?<br> No, of course not.<br> Why would anyone spy on you?<br> Colin.<br> Whose side are you on?<br> Yours, Miss Monroe.<br> Call me Marilyn.<br> Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.<br> - Larry will get jealous.<br> - Nothing happened.<br> You were there for ten minutes.<br> Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle.<br> I dreamed last night<br> that I could hear singing.<br> And then I realized it wasn't a dream.<br> There was a male voice choir<br> serenading Marilyn under our window.<br> At two in the morning.<br> It's a circus. Freak show.<br> I'm going back to New York<br> for a few days.<br> I need a break.<br> I need to see my kids.<br> - That won't help Marilyn.<br> - I can't help her.<br> She wants me to protect her,<br> but... I can't.<br> She thought I could smash<br> all her insecurities.<br> That I can make her a new person.<br> She read some notes I made.<br> They were nothing.<br> Just... Just a few ideas.<br> - But about her?<br> - She took them the wrong way.<br> You do... love her,<br> your new bride and all that?<br> I can't work.<br> I can't think.<br> She's devouring me.<br> - Good morning, Vivien.<br> Uh, ladies and gentlemen,<br> my darling wife.<br> Hello. I hope Larry isn't<br> making you all work too hard.<br> I know what a dreadful<br> slave-driver he could be.<br> David. He would be lost without you.<br> - Just doing my job.<br> - And Jack, of course. Jack.<br> Oh. I'm getting old, Jack.<br> More beautiful every year, Vivien.<br> Well, I need you to work<br> your miracles on me.<br> Are you looking after Larry<br> like I told you?<br> I'm doing my best, Vivien.<br> Marilyn, darling.<br> Larry tells me<br> that you are quite superb,<br> - and I am wild with jealousy.<br> - Oh.<br> But everyone says you were<br> a wonderful Elsie on stage.<br> Oh, but I'm too old<br> to play her in the film.<br> Larry was quite brutal about that.<br> You see, the truth<br> is all that matters to him,<br> and that's why we all<br> admire him so very much.<br> I must let you work.<br> I just wanted to wish you good luck.<br> - Hi, Vivien.<br> - Goodbye, and you.<br> - I love the mustache. I do.<br> It suits you. Bye...<br> So I wasn't addressed.<br> Who cares?<br> Bull in the labyrinth. Oop!<br> Who the heck is Theseus anyway?<br> I didn't think she<br> would be so beautiful.<br> - Disgraceful!<br> - Oh, she shines on that screen.<br> Oh, darling.<br> Puss, don't upset yourself.<br> You are ten times<br> the actress she will ever be.<br> Oh, if you could see yourself.<br> The way you watch her!<br> Oh, Vivien, you're imagining things.<br> Please.<br> I hope she makes your life hell.<br> - Vivien...<br> Do you have a cigarette,<br> please, Colin?<br> No, not one of my awful things.<br> Remember, boy,<br> when it comes to women,<br> - you're never too old for humiliation.<br> Marilyn won't shoot today.<br> She's gone back to Parkside.<br> She's upset about<br> Arthur leaving England.<br> He's only going to visit his children.<br> You don't leave Marilyn alone.<br> She can't handle it.<br> She thinks that everyone's<br> going to abandon her.<br> Let's hope she's<br> changed her bloody mind.<br> - Yes.<br> - Sir Laurence?<br> - Roger, what's up?<br> - Is, uh, Colin there, sir?<br> - Yes, he is.<br> - Can I speak to him?<br> Colin, it's for you.<br> - Roger?<br> - Colin.<br> Miss Monroe.<br> Why don't you drop by here<br> on your way home.<br> - Uh...<br> - What?<br> What is Marilyn doing on the phone<br> with my third fucking assistant?<br> Yes, I'm sure I could do that.<br> Good.<br> Don't tell anyone, though.<br> Well, is she coming back?<br> No, she wants to see me.<br> He shouldn't be talking to her.<br> He's just a kid.<br> - Supposing he said something.<br> - I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing.<br> Don't you, Colin?<br> I know you're awfully busy, Colin,<br> but if you could manage to find<br> me a cup of tea before you leave,<br> that would be marvelous.<br> Miss Monroe said<br> for you to wait.<br> Help yourself to a drink.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I was checking<br> that you've got everything.<br> Let me.<br> Are you frightened of me, Colin?<br> No.<br> Good. 'Cause I like you.<br> I want you to help me.<br> Well, I'm only the third.<br> I'm just... I'm a messenger, really.<br> But you know everything<br> that's going on.<br> You can see both sides of the situation.<br> Please tell me everything.<br> - Uh...<br> - Relax.<br> I thought you weren't scared of me.<br> - Are you hungry?<br> - Uh...<br> I'll have them send in a tray.<br> I'm starved.<br> Oh, go... Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.<br> Am I interrupting something?<br> Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin<br> waiting for you at home.<br> There's no Mrs. Colin.<br> So we can talk as long as we like.<br> Why is Sir Olivier so mean?<br> He talks awful to me.<br> Like he's slumming.<br> I'll tell you what's wrong.<br> It's agony for him<br> because he is a great actor<br> that wants to be a film star.<br> And it's agony for you<br> because you're a film star who<br> wants to be a great actress.<br> And this film won't help either of you.<br> You sure you can handle that?<br> You don't look old enough to drink.<br> - I'm 23, Miss Monroe.<br> - Oh, it's Marilyn.<br> Hmm. I'm 30.<br> I guess that makes me<br> an old lady to you.<br> Seven years is nothing.<br> You know I've been<br> married three times already.<br> How did that happen?<br> Maybe you're just<br> looking for the right man.<br> They always look right at the start.<br> I'll get that.<br> - Hello?<br> - Colin, is everything OK?<br> Everything's fine.<br> Uh, Miss Monroe, she just.<br> She had some large packages<br> she needed handling.<br> OK, what does she want?<br> Colin?<br> - Let me speak to her, Colin.<br> Oh...<br> Let me talk to her. Sh!<br> - Let me speak to her.<br> - What is going on, Colin?<br> - I'm afraid she's tied up right now.<br> Let me talk to her, damn it.<br> - Let me talk to her.<br> - Colin!<br> - I'm sorry, Milton.<br> - I'm sorry. I have to go.<br> - Colin!<br> Let's go for a walk in the garden.<br> Let's go see if we can find any more<br> reporters in the bushes.<br> Oh, I didn't know<br> it was so pretty out here.<br> You should get out more.<br> You should see the sights.<br> - I am the sights.<br> You know, we're just like<br> Elsie and the young king.<br> What would Sir Laurence say<br> if he could see us now?<br> I don't think he'd mind.<br> But he thinks that I'm the enemy.<br> No, he doesn't understand<br> your kind of actor.<br> He's hated the Method ever since<br> Vivien worked with Elia Kazan.<br> It's all too strange and new.<br> So you're the future,<br> and that frightens him.<br> You know what?<br> Every time I walk into the studio,<br> I feel a sense of doom come over me.<br> He gives me the dirtiest looks,<br> even when he's smiling.<br> And the crew hates me.<br> No, that's not true.<br> The only person I can trust is Paula.<br> Except for you now, maybe.<br> Phone call from New York,<br> Miss Monroe. It's Mr. Miller.<br> - Goodbye, Colin.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Thank you for telling me the truth.<br> You'll be leaving now, I expect.<br> I don't care if he fucks her sideways.<br> Perhaps it'll calm her down.<br> Oh, hello, boy.<br> Hear you spent<br> last night with Marilyn.<br> I didn't spend the night with her.<br> We just... We had a chat.<br> - I heard them chuckling.<br> - Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic,<br> Marilyn's more likely to behave herself.<br> - She just wants a chum, that's all.<br> - A chum?<br> Jesus Christ, what is this,<br> Goodbye, Mr. Chips?<br> Grow up, kid.<br> You know, I thought working with Marilyn<br> would make me feel young again.<br> But I look dead in the rushes.<br> Dead behind these eyes.<br> I wanted to renew myself through her.<br> But all I see reflected<br> in that magnificent face<br> is my own inadequacy.<br> You know, I admire Marilyn.<br> I really do, despite her behavior.<br> She's taken everything<br> Hollywood can throw at her<br> and she's triumphed.<br> That takes some bloody guts.<br> An actress has to be pretty tough<br> to get even a tenth as far as she has.<br> Be careful, boy.<br> She doesn't need to be rescued.<br> Not really.<br> It's you.<br> Marvelous!<br> Absolutely marvelous, darling.<br> That's wonderful. Well done.<br> Let's check that.<br> Three minutes, ladies<br> and gentlemen. Three minutes!<br> Colin! Arthur Miller called me.<br> He's not happy with you.<br> - He doesn't even know who I am.<br> - Marilyn must have said something.<br> Well, maybe she's trying<br> to make him jealous.<br> Listen, kid. I've known<br> Marilyn for seven years.<br> I fell in love with her<br> just as you've done.<br> We had ten days together,<br> and that was it.<br> She picked me up, she put me<br> down, that's what she does.<br> She breaks hearts.<br> She will break yours.<br> My advice to you is quit<br> before you get burned.<br> - I don't need your advice.<br> - Have it your way.<br> You don't see Marilyn again.<br> You don't even talk to her.<br> She's completely off limits to you.<br> Do you understand me?<br> Yes.<br> - I waited for you on Friday.<br> - Lucy, I'm so sorry.<br> I completely forgot.<br> I just... I've been so busy.<br> So I hear.<br> Well, you know how crews gossip.<br> There's nothing in it.<br> Of course there isn't.<br> Marilyn Monroe fancying you?<br> Come on.<br> - Oh, hi, Colin.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi, Lucy.<br> - I thought you were different.<br> - I really like you, and we have fun.<br> And now it's time to set<br> your sights a little higher.<br> Well, good luck.<br> - Get in.<br> - Any problem, Roger?<br> Uh, no. Just dropped by<br> to take Colin out to lunch.<br> You're not taking him to Marilyn.<br> That would drop us all<br> in a whole ocean of shit.<br> No, sir. Been looking forward<br> to this, haven't we, Colin?<br> Yeah.<br> OK. You have a nice time, boys.<br> - Surprise!<br> - Jesus!<br> Roger and I decided<br> to take you on an adventure.<br> - What the hell?<br> - Colin!<br> - Oh!<br> Get back here, you little bastard!<br> Colin! You're fired! You hear me?<br> Do you think he saw me?<br> Colin!<br> Snuggle up. This is fun.<br> This is the getaway car.<br> I oughta feel like this every day.<br> We have today, anyway.<br> We have one day to do<br> whatever you like.<br> Then we can go back<br> to real life tomorrow.<br> Only one day?<br> - Well, maybe the weekend.<br> - Or a week!<br> What should we do now?<br> We could go to Windsor Castle,<br> if you like.<br> Detective Chief<br> Superintendent Smith.<br> I'm escorting this lady<br> and gentleman for the day.<br> They'd like to look around the castle.<br> I need a contact name for the book.<br> You don't know Her Majesty,<br> by any chance?<br> Yes, we met at a movie premiere.<br> She said my dress was pretty.<br> I don't think that quite does it, sir.<br> My godfather works here.<br> He's the royal librarian.<br> Sir Owen Morehead.<br> - Hello, sir.<br> - Colin, my boy! Come in!<br> Forgive the dust.<br> Oh, you are very pretty, my dear.<br> Oh!<br> Gee, I'd sure like<br> to read all these books.<br> Luckily, one doesn't really have to.<br> A lot of them just have<br> pictures in.<br> - This is by an artist called Holbein.<br> - She's beautiful.<br> She was the daughter<br> of one of the king's courtiers.<br> Nearly 400 years ago.<br> Gee, I hope I look that good<br> when I'm 400.<br> These are by Leonardo da Vinci.<br> Didn't he paint that lady<br> with the funny smile?<br> - The Mona Lisa.<br> - Do you have that one here, too?<br> Alas, that one got away.<br> - Oh.<br> - The Queen's sorry to have missed you.<br> - Really?<br> Oh, yes! Why, she was only<br> saying to me the other day,<br> "What must it be like to be<br> the most famous woman on Earth?"<br> Colin, look.<br> Gee, I sure never had a doll's house<br> like this when I was a kid.<br> - Can I?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> This is me.<br> That's you, and these are our kids.<br> Oh, our daughter's so pretty.<br> All little girls should be<br> told how pretty they are.<br> Should grow up knowing how<br> much their mother loves them.<br> There she is!<br> Shall I be her?<br> - Are you somebody, mate?<br> - No. I'm no one.<br> So this<br> is your old school, huh?<br> - Did you sing in the school choir?<br> - No.<br> That's a lie, I can tell.<br> - How old were you?<br> I was sent away to boarding<br> school when I was eight.<br> Why? Didn't your parents<br> like you very much?<br> That's just how they do it in my family.<br> Well, I'd never send my kids away.<br> Eton is 500 years old.<br> It was founded by King Henry VI.<br> No wonder it's so dusty.<br> Looks more like a palace.<br> That room there,<br> upper school, that's where you're sent<br> if you don't work hard enough.<br> You're whipped.<br> - No.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> - That's awful.<br> - It's Marilyn Monroe!<br> Oh!<br> - Look who it is!<br> - Come see Marilyn.<br> - Well, hello, boys.<br> - Pleased to meet you!<br> - Blow us a kiss, Marilyn!<br> Sure. All right, boys. Work hard!<br> I don't want anyone whipping you.<br> - You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!<br> - Ch!<br> - Oh!<br> - Maybe we should go.<br> - It's time to go. Lovely to see you.<br> Hurry up, slowpoke!<br> There's no...<br> We haven't got our... We can't...<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, God.<br> This is great.<br> Oh, my God!<br> What if a boat goes past?<br> We'll be arrested.<br> Don't worry. Roger will fix it.<br> - Ooh!<br> - What?<br> - I have something in my eye.<br> - Let me see.<br> I can't see anything.<br> That's the first time<br> I've kissed anyone younger than me.<br> There's a lot<br> of older guys in Hollywood.<br> Ooh.<br> Don't be shy, Colin.<br> It's nothing you haven't seen before.<br> Oh, Colin. And you, an old Etonian.<br> - My God, it's cold. It's freezing!<br> - Here. Come here. Let me warm you up.<br> - Is that better?<br> I want this to be the perfect date.<br> I haven't had a real date<br> since I was 13 years old.<br> That was nice.<br> Ahem! Time to go home,<br> I think, Miss Monroe.<br> Be careful not<br> to get in too deep, son.<br> Hi, Milton.<br> The next time I come on set,<br> you better make sure Colin is there.<br> Take him home.<br> You spent the day with her.<br> What frame of mind was she in?<br> - She was fine, sir.<br> - Oh, how lovely.<br> Well, go and find out why<br> she's not standing here<br> right now in front of that.<br> There's a good chap.<br> And perhaps on this splendid<br> day we can persuade her<br> to do some of the work that she is<br> currently paying herself to do.<br> - Don't start, Dickie.<br> - You won't get any sympathy from me.<br> - She's trying her best.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> Little Colin's in love.<br> - Colin?<br> - What's the matter?<br> It's Marilyn.<br> She's asking for you.<br> She hasn't made a sound<br> for over an hour.<br> - So how many pills did she take?<br> - Jesus! Who knows.<br> - I wasn't counting.<br> - Marilyn? So how about the window?<br> Marilyn, darling?<br> Open the door, bubbeleh.<br> That's her window.<br> Marilyn?<br> Marilyn.<br> Colin?<br> Oh, hi, Colin.<br> Are you OK?<br> Everyone's worried about you.<br> Qh, phooey.<br> Colin!<br> - Get in.<br> - Colin!<br> - Colin, come on, open up!<br> - Colin?<br> - Colin!<br> Open this door.<br> She needs me. Colin!<br> You don't understand her.<br> - Come on.<br> - She's fine, uh...<br> Come on, open up!<br> - I'm gonna keep an eye on her,<br> and I will sleep on the sofa.<br> Colin, listen to me.<br> You can't talk to her.<br> I can't find the key.<br> Look, you can all go home now.<br> - You don't understand her. Come on.<br> - Go home.<br> Oh, my...<br> Colin. What are you doing here?<br> Uh, I came in through the window.<br> Milton thought that you were sick.<br> Oh.<br> The window.<br> How romantic.<br> That's just like Romeo and Juliet.<br> What... Why would<br> they say that I'm sick?<br> Please.<br> Please don't take any more.<br> - Who's this? Who's that?<br> That's my mama.<br> She bought me a white piano.<br> Right before they<br> took her to the asylum.<br> I grew up in other<br> people's homes, mostly.<br> Is that Abraham Lincoln?<br> That's my dad.<br> Well, I don't know who my real father<br> is, so it may as well be him, right?<br> Do you have a home, Colin?<br> A real one?<br> - With a mama and a daddy?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Do they love you?<br> I'm sure that they do.<br> Mm. You're lucky.<br> Yes.<br> Do you love me, Colin?<br> Yes.<br> You're like some Greek goddess to me.<br> I'm not a goddess.<br> I just wanna be loved<br> like a regular girl.<br> - Mr. Miller loves you.<br> - No, I found his notebook.<br> He said the most<br> horrible things about me.<br> Writers, they scribble all kinds<br> of things. It doesn't mean anything.<br> No, he wanted me to find it.<br> He said he wished<br> he'd never married me.<br> Why do the people<br> I love always leave me?<br> I will never leave you.<br> All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe.<br> As soon as they realize<br> I'm not her, they run.<br> You're different.<br> You're not like that.<br> You should date that wardrobe girl.<br> She's so pretty.<br> I don't want to.<br> I love you.<br> This is nice.<br> It's like spoons.<br> I used to do this with Johnny.<br> - Who's Johnny?<br> - Johnny Hyde.<br> He was my agent back in the old days.<br> He was thin just like you.<br> Marilyn, do one thing for me.<br> Mm...<br> Come to the studio on-time tomorrow<br> and show everybody what you can do.<br> Show Larry that you are a great actress.<br> OK.<br> No matter what<br> others may say or do<br> Light of heart and fancy free<br> That's the way to start<br> There will be nothing to lose<br> Till you lose your<br> Heart <br> - Oh!<br> - This is intolerable!<br> - With deepest respects, sir.<br> My message was so important,<br> I had no choice but to intrude.<br> - Revolution?<br> - No, sir.<br> Miss Marina's aunt has<br> been in a motor accident.<br> What?<br> Oh, go away, you silly man.<br> Miss Marina, your aunt. Do you realize<br> how serious her condition is?<br> Well, it's her own fault.<br> She has no right out<br> this time of night. She's 93!<br> - Cut it there.<br> Well, whatever it was you did<br> to her, boy, keep doing it.<br> - I've never seen her so happy.<br> - Yes.<br> - We need Colin<br> at the house right away.<br> Got a pain in my side,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> What are they trying to make me<br> think I'm crazy or something?<br> Is that what it is? You know I don't<br> just rev it up like a Model T.<br> I don't just crank it up.<br> No one's asking you to just crank it up.<br> We're worried about you...<br> Isn't that what you're saying?<br> I was sick, for God's sake!<br> - Can I be sick?<br> - Colin's here.<br> Colin.<br> Colin.<br> Colin thinks I'm a good actress.<br> Don't you, Colin?<br> - Yes I do. You were wonderful today.<br> - See?<br> - Marilyn's tired now.<br> - I want him to stay with me.<br> And what would Arthur say<br> if he knew Colin was here?<br> You heard what she said,<br> she wants me here. Come on.<br> You have no idea of your<br> position in the world, Marilyn.<br> You are the greatest actress<br> that has ever been.<br> Mm?<br> I love you like a daughter.<br> - Oh.<br> - My darling girl. I know it's hard now.<br> But you will survive this and go on<br> to better things. You're young.<br> Your life is ahead of you,<br> just beginning.<br> Sit with Colin, mm?<br> Oh, Paula, I'm sorry.<br> - Come here.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Come here. I'm here now.<br> Colin?<br> - I'll look after you.<br> - Don't leave.<br> - I'm not.<br> - Please don't leave.<br> - I'm not. Sh.<br> - Please don't leave.<br> Please don't leave.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, it hurts, it hurts!<br> It's a baby! It's a baby!<br> I can't lose the baby! Colin!<br> Oh!<br> Roger! Call a doctor!<br> Who's in charge here?<br> I've given Mrs. Miller an injection<br> and the bleeding stopped.<br> But she needs to stay in bed tomorrow,<br> and after that she'll be fine.<br> I suggest someone stays with her.<br> She'll be safe with me. Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good night, then.<br> Was she really pregnant, sir?<br> I think that's a private matter<br> between Mr. and Mrs. Miller, don't you?<br> Arthur's on his way back.<br> When this movie is over,<br> I'm gonna settle down<br> and be a good wife to him.<br> I'm gonna learn to make matzo-ball soup<br> as good as his dad.<br> We have to forget this<br> whole thing ever happened.<br> I don't want to forget.<br> Let me protect you from all this.<br> Oh. What are you gonna do?<br> - Marry me?<br> - Why not?<br> You could quit this.<br> Forget Marilyn Monroe.<br> Forget Hollywood. Let it all go.<br> Just let it go.<br> I couldn't just give it up.<br> Why not?<br> Why not, when it drives you crazy?<br> You think I'm crazy?<br> I just meant that you could be happy.<br> I am happy.<br> Of course you're happy.<br> You're the biggest star in the world.<br> You're right.<br> We have to forget all this.<br> So from now on, I'm just<br> the third assistant director,<br> and we will never look<br> at each other again.<br> Maybe just a wink.<br> Once in a while.<br> - My dear. My dear.<br> - Yes?<br> - They're ready for you on set.<br> - Marilyn?<br> - Just arrived.<br> Only an hour late.<br> Not bad by her standards.<br> Perhaps we'll finish this<br> bloody film after all.<br> - Five-two-seven. Take one.<br> - Cut it there.<br> - And check that, please.<br> Five-eight-four, take two.<br> Take five.<br> Six-four-nine, take two.<br> Let's cut it there.<br> - Very quiet, studio.<br> I found a dream<br> Laying in your arms<br> The whole night through<br> I'm yours<br> No matter what others may say<br> Or do<br> Light of heart and fancy free<br> That's the way to start<br> There will be nothing to lose<br> Till you lose your heart <br> First love is such sweet despair, Colin.<br> Cut. That's a wrap.<br> She's there.<br> I hope you will all forgive me.<br> It wasn't altogether my fault,<br> but I've been ill.<br> I'd like you to remember I tried.<br> Lucy, um...<br> I was wondering if you were<br> doing anything on Saturday.<br> I'm washing my hair.<br> Did she break your heart?<br> A little.<br> Good. It needed breaking.<br> We're back, everyone!<br> All right...<br> You do look, my son, in a moved<br> sort, as if you were dismayed.<br> Be cheerful, sir.<br> Our revels now are ended.<br> We are such stuff<br> as dreams are made on,<br> and our little life<br> is rounded with a sleep.<br> Prospero.<br> She's quite wonderful.<br> No training, no craft to speak of.<br> No guile, just pure instinct.<br> She's astonishing.<br> - You should tell her that.<br> - Oh, I will. But she won't believe me.<br> President Taft.<br> It's probably<br> what makes her great.<br> It's almost certainly what<br> makes her so profoundly unhappy.<br> Oh, Miss Marina,<br> won't you have some champagne?<br> Oh, I don't know, Your Grand Ducal.<br> You really think I ought?<br> I tried my best to change her,<br> but she remains brilliant, despite me.<br> Maybe just up to... Ah!<br> Do you know, I think directing a movie<br> has to be just about<br> the best job ever invented.<br> But Marilyn's cured me<br> of ever wanting to do it again.<br> - Well, now I'm back to the theater.<br> John Osborne's writing a piece for me.<br> Sir, I thought you hated<br> all that Royal Court stuff.<br> Well, Miller made me see<br> things a little differently.<br> Thank you, Colin, for all your help.<br> Glad you ran away to the circus?<br> - My dear.<br> Uh... ow.<br> I've got a solemn word<br> of warning for you.<br> What is that, my beloved?<br> You know what's going to happen.<br> I'm going to fall in love with you.<br> I'm going to fall in love with you<br> because I always, always do.<br> There you go.<br> Buy a girl a drink?<br> I'll get another one<br> of those, please, Barry.<br> I wasn't going to leave<br> without saying goodbye.<br> Don't forget me.<br> As if I could.<br> Everybody else on the picture<br> wishes they could.<br> They don't understand you.<br> Walk me to my car?<br> Nice place you got here.<br> Thanks for being on my side.<br> Looking a couple of inches taller<br> than when I first saw you.<br> Her embrace.<br> Her belief in me.<br> And the joy she gave.<br> That was her gift.<br> When I think of her now, I think<br> of that time when a dream came true.<br> And my only talent<br> was not to close my eyes.<br> That old black magic<br> Has me in its spell<br> That old black magic<br> That you weave so well<br> And down and down I go<br> Round and round I go<br> In a spin<br> Lovin' that spin I'm in<br> Under that old black magic<br> Called love<br> For you're the lover<br> I have waited for<br> The mate that fate<br> Had me created for<br> But every time your lips meet mine<br> Darling, down, down Down I go<br> Round, round, round I go<br> In a spin<br> Loving that spin I'm in<br> Under that old black magic<br> Called<br> Love <br>
