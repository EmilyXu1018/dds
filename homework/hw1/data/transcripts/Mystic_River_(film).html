                        before the end of the season last year...<br> ...and then re-injured it in spring training...<br> ...on a terrific game-saving play.<br> You know, I was talking with...<br> What time is this going on?<br> - 7:30 is the pre-game.<br> Who'd you say was pitching tonight?<br> - Tiant's pitching.<br> Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.<br> - I'd hate to be facing him.<br> Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?<br> - Yankees.<br> Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming<br> at you. You don't have time to think.<br> What kind of night you think Fisk will have?<br> He's been hot lately.<br> He gets on base twice tonight,<br> gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.<br> Save.<br> The sewer.<br> Hold on, I'll get it.<br> Sorry, guys, I guess I don't<br> know my own strength.<br> You know what, Dave? That must be it.<br> Hey...<br> ...you guys know what<br> would be really cool?<br> What?<br> - Driving a car.<br> You know, just around the block.<br> Yeah?<br> Anyone on this street<br> keep their keys in their car?<br> I steal a car, my dad will kill me.<br> Just around the block. Who said steal?<br> Your dad kill you<br> for writing your name too?<br> See, now it'll be there forever.<br> Me too.<br> Forever.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> You brats think it's okay to destroy<br> municipal property?<br> Huh?<br> Come here.<br> Get over here.<br> Well, do you?<br> No, sir.<br> - No, sir.<br> No.<br> - No, what?<br> Sir.<br> You're the hard case of the group, huh?<br> A pack of punks, huh?<br> You live around here?<br> Right there.<br> You?<br> Right over there.<br> How about you?<br> Where do you live, son?<br> Rester Street.<br> - Is your mother home?<br> We're gonna go have a talk with her.<br> Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.<br> Get in.<br> Get the fuck inside.<br> In.<br> You kids go tell your mothers<br> what you've been up to.<br> And don't let me catch you shits<br> ruining my sidewalks again.<br> What do you mean?<br> Who put Dave in a car?<br> The cop. He had a gold badge.<br> How do you know it was a cop?<br> See anything on the badge?<br> No, no writing.<br> - He had a uniform on?<br> Like a regular police uniform?<br> He was a cop.<br> - He took Davey.<br> So, what were you guys doing?<br> - We wrote our names in the cement, but...<br> You were writing in cement<br> and playing hockey, but they took Dave?<br> That doesn't make sense. Come on.<br> - Is there something wrong, Dad?<br> Please.<br> No more.<br> Please.<br> No more, please.<br> Have you seen him?<br> - Looks like damaged goods to me.<br> Jesus.<br> You took some good swings today.<br> Dad, I struck out.<br> Good swings, though. That's what counts.<br> I'll never be a good ballplayer.<br> You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.<br> Star shortstop, Trinity High School,<br> You're gonna be a great ballplayer.<br> Hey, see that gutter drain over there?<br> - Yeah.<br> I used to play on this street<br> when I was a kid.<br> That drain swallowed every ball we had.<br> Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.<br> If we could get that manhole cover up...<br> ...could be 1000 balls down there.<br> Really? Let's try.<br> Get in.<br> Come on, Dad,<br> come help me hunt for balls.<br> Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home<br> before Mom starts to worry.<br> Jimmy. Jimmy.<br> Earth to Mr. Markum.<br> What do you want now, Pete?<br> - Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?<br> We're out of the Marlboros<br> and the Winstons are looking grim.<br> So?<br> - So that means less profit...<br> ...and more profit means I get a raise.<br> So why don't you order more.<br> All right, but if the<br> surgeon general calls, you're my alibi.<br> Hey, you.<br> - Hey, there.<br> I'm going out tonight<br> with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.<br> Don't stay out too late. You got your<br> sister's First Communion tomorrow.<br> Christ, I sound like...<br> - Someone's father?<br> Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.<br> Later, Daddy.<br> - Later.<br> Have fun.<br> Later.<br> - Later.<br> Brendan.<br> You scared the shit out of me.<br> - I'm sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.<br> He sees you sneaking<br> into my car, he'll shoot you.<br> What will he do if he sees this?<br> Shoot you and then kill you.<br> It's been six hours.<br> I had to see you.<br> I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.<br> Tomorrow?<br> Like we planned?<br> Tomorrow.<br> Drop me around the corner.<br> Take it easy.<br> - He kept cutting me off.<br> He kept cutting me off.<br> He kept cutting me off.<br> He followed me all the way from goddamn<br> Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me.<br> That son of a bitch.<br> Can you believe this<br> guy keeps confessing?<br> I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab<br> a lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.<br> Hey, Devine?<br> What you looking at?<br> - The old neighborhood.<br> We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.<br> - No, I think we're good, thanks.<br> A few of us are going to the Cantab after.<br> No, I don't think so, Jen.<br> Thanks. Thanks anyway.<br> Yeah.<br> So the wife left you six months ago?<br> - So?<br> So Jenny Coughlin there<br> with the body, voice and the cuffs...<br> This girl, she makes gay guys<br> rethink their orientation.<br> So, what's your point?<br> The girl just wants to bed you,<br> not wed you. You don't even blink?<br> She wants to worship<br> at the temple of Devine.<br> I'm married, Whitey.<br> - So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.<br> You haven't talked to Lauren in six months.<br> - She calls all the time.<br> And says absolutely nothing.<br> Weirdest thing I ever heard of.<br> One of these days, the phone's gonna ring<br> and she'll tell me why she left.<br> Yeah? Maybe she's waiting<br> for you to say something.<br> Come on, come on, come on.<br> The pitch. A swing and a line drive<br> into right field. A base hit.<br> I just don't feel like<br> they're gonna win this one.<br> Could we please have three beers?<br> Yeah, come on.<br> You believe those chicks?<br> Come on.<br> - Oh, yeah, baby.<br> Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?<br> We've got you right over here, boys.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> I've known her since she was a kid.<br> A ball and two strikes.

I can't go to the hospital.<br> - Oh, my God, Dave.<br> Come on. Come here.<br> So I'm walking to my car, and this guy<br> comes up to me and asks for a light.<br> I say I don't smoke.<br> He says neither does he.<br> My heart starts clocking a buck fifty<br> because there's no one around.<br> Oh, God.<br> - That's when I see the knife.<br> Says, 'Your wallet or your life.<br> I'm leaving with one of them.'<br> That's what he said?<br> - Yeah.<br> So I try to brush past him.<br> That's when he slices me.<br> You said you swung on him first.<br> Jesus, Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?<br> I'm sorry, babe.<br> I went fucking nuts on him, baby.

Bat back.<br> All the way back.<br> I never saw anything like that before.<br> What do we got?<br> Oh, Christ.<br> Is that her?<br> Yeah.<br> We'll have the father<br> do a positive ID at the morgue.<br> Blood's from a split<br> in the crown of her head.<br> She was beaten with a stick,<br> but that didn't kill her.<br> She was shot a second time.<br> Looks like a.38.<br> What the fuck am I gonna tell him?<br> 'Hey, Jimmy...<br> ...God said you owed another marker.<br> He came to collect.'<br> Hey.<br> - Hold on.<br> Grab him. Stop that guy.<br> - Hey, you.<br> I'm fucking going in there.<br> - Take it easy.<br> Get his arms.<br> - Hold him. Come on.<br> Let me in, you motherfuckers.<br> - Take it easy.<br> Let me in.<br> - Is she in there?.<br> Sean, is my daughter in there?.<br> - Let me in. You motherfuckers.<br> Is my daughter in there?. Is she in there?.<br> Is she in there?.<br> Hey, take it easy. That's the father.<br> Is my daughter in there?. Motherfuckers.<br> Is that my daughter in there?.<br> Look into my eyes. Is she in there?.<br> Get off me.<br> - Sean, is that my daughter in there?.<br> Is that my daughter in there?<br> No. No.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, God.<br> Oh, God, no.<br> No one's said anything, right?<br> What do you mean?<br> You haven't seen her yet, right?<br> It might not be her, right?<br> Jimmy?<br> Jimmy, please...<br> - Please what?<br> Please...<br> - Please what, baby? Please what?<br> That's her.<br> That's Katie.<br> That's my daughter.<br> Fresh-brewed.<br> So we need to work a time line.<br> It's details, little things that make a case.<br> You know, things that you could<br> forget about after a day or two.<br> Did you ever think about how one little<br> choice could change a whole life?<br> I heard Hitler's mother wanted to abort him.<br> At the last minute, she changed her mind.<br> See what I mean?<br> What do you mean, Jimmy?<br> What if you or I had gotten<br> into that car instead of Dave Boyle?<br> What car?<br> - You're losing me here.<br> If I'd gotten into that car that day,<br> my life would have been a different thing.<br> My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...<br> ...she was a beautiful woman.<br> Regal.<br> As a lot of Latin women are,<br> and she knew it.<br> You had to have balls<br> to go near her, and I did.<br> Eighteen years old, the two of us.<br> She was carrying Katie.<br> Now, here's the thing, Sean.<br> If I'd gotten into that car,<br> I'd be a basket case.<br> I never would have had the juice<br> to go near her.<br> And Katie never would have been born.<br> And she never would have<br> been murdered. You know?<br> You ever see Dave around?<br> - He married my cousin Celeste.<br> What time did Katie get home<br> from work yesterday?<br> Around 7:30.<br> Anything unusual,<br> out of the way about her?<br> No. She sat with us,<br> with me and the girls, while we ate.<br> She was having dinner with her friends.<br> Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?<br> - Yeah.<br> She talked to Nadine<br> about her Communion...<br> ...and then she was on the phone<br> in her room for a bit.<br> And then around 8, she left.<br> Do you know who she talked to?<br> - No.<br> Do you mind if we have the phone company<br> subpoenaed for records?<br> No, go ahead.<br> - Good.<br> You say you spent most<br> of the day Saturday...<br> with your daughter in the store, correct?<br> Yes and no. I was mostly in back.<br> Anything odd? A confrontation<br> with a customer, anything?<br> No, she was herself, she was happy. She...<br> She what?<br> It's nothing.<br> Listen, the littlest thing<br> could be something right now.<br> It's just that when she was little,<br> right after her mother died...<br> ...I had just gotten out of prison,<br> she couldn't be by herself.<br> Whether she was crying or not,<br> it didn't matter...<br> ...but she gave a look sometimes, like<br> she was preparing to never see you again.<br> For a couple of seconds on Saturday,<br> she looked at me that way.<br> Okay.<br> - It was just a look.<br> It's information. We collect it,<br> put it together, see what fits. Little things.<br> You were in prison?<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> - Here we go.<br> Whitey.<br> - I'm just asking.<br> Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit<br> for robbery at Deer Island.<br> Is that gonna find<br> my daughter's killer? Just asking.<br> Let's forget about that.<br> Let's get back to the point.<br> Sorry.<br> - It's all right. It's all right.<br> Okay, Mr. Markum.<br> Okay.<br> - Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...<br> ...outside of the look Katie gave you,<br> was there anything else?<br> There was this kid.<br> What am I talking about?<br> That was this morning.<br> What? Remember, it's the little things.<br> This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,<br> like he was expecting to see her.<br> Barely knew each other.<br> - Could they have been dating?<br> No.<br> - What makes you so sure?<br> Sean, are you gonna grill me?<br> A father knows.<br> Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?<br> No one right now, as far as we know.<br> I mean, knew.<br> - I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.<br> We got girls at home wanting to know<br> where their sister is.<br> All right, there will be a trooper<br> downstairs to take you home.<br> And if you think of anything...<br> ...anything at all, give us a call.<br> He said you almost got into a car<br> when you were kids?<br> Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle<br> were playing in front of my house.<br> This car came up and took Dave away.<br> Abduction?<br> - Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.<br> Convinced Dave to get in the car,<br> kept him for four days before he escaped.<br> They catch these guys?<br> - One died.<br> The other got busted,<br> went the noose route in his cell.<br> Your pal Markum, the moment I laid<br> eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.<br> They never lose that tension,<br> it settles in their shoulders.<br> He lost his daughter.<br> That's what's in his shoulders.<br> No, that's in his stomach.<br> The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.<br> Cause of death: the gunshot wound to<br> the head, not the trauma from the beating.<br> What else?<br> - Her and her friends were barhopping.<br> We're interviewing anyone<br> who might have seen them.<br> One other thing,<br> the backpack in her car...<br> ...had pamphlets on Las Vegas<br> and a list of Vegas hotels.<br> It doesn't sound like much.<br> What do you say, Devine?<br> We'll get the guy, sir.<br> That's right. All right, let's do it.<br> That's the best you can come up with?<br> - It made him happy, didn't it?<br> This is Sean.<br> Hello?<br> - Is it Lauren?<br> You're in Manhattan.<br> I can tell by the traffic sounds.<br> Is he with you?<br> Is that the baby?<br> Lauren, at least tell me her name.<br> Yeah, nice talking to you too.<br> Hey.<br> Would it surprise you?<br> Wouldn't be the first time.<br> Did you see that girl?<br> Did you see that...?<br> Did you see her?<br> I heard a car hit something.<br> - Hit what? Another car?<br> Oh, no, not loud like that.<br> - Like hitting the curb?<br> Yes, maybe.<br> Then it stalled, and someone said, 'Hi.'<br> Someone said, 'Hi'?<br> - 'Hi.'<br> Then there was a loud crack.<br> Could it have been a gunshot?<br> - Yes, maybe.<br> Did you look out your window, Mrs. Prior?<br> - Oh, no.<br> I was in my dressing gown by then.<br> I don't look out the window<br> in my dressing gown.<br> The voice you heard,<br> was that a male or a female?<br> Female.<br> I think.<br> It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.<br> - Yeah.<br> Sorry to trouble you.<br> Jimmy.<br> - Theo.<br> How's my daughter?<br> How's Annabeth holding up?<br> She's trying.<br> - Let's get these on ice.<br> You got a couple of coolers?<br> Right here's fine.<br> So how are you handling all this so far?<br> It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.<br> - Yeah?<br> It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.<br> When my Janey died,<br> I was no good for six months...<br> ...but my kids were<br> all grown up. I had that luxury.<br> You, you got domestic responsibilities.<br> Domestic responsibilities?<br> Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter<br> and those girls. That's your first priority.<br> Oh, you figured that might<br> have slipped my mind?<br> It just needed to be said, that's all.<br> You'll come through because you're a man.<br> Like I said to Annabeth,<br> your wedding day.<br> I said, 'You got yourself<br> a real old-school man there.'<br> Like they put her in a bag.<br> - What?<br> That's what Katie looked like<br> when I saw her in the morgue.<br> Like they put her in a bag<br> and then they beat the bag with pipes.<br> Well...<br> - Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.<br> She went to sleep,<br> she never woke up. Peaceful.<br> You don't need to talk about Janey.<br> - My daughter was murdered.<br> They put a gun to her. As we stand here,<br> she's on an autopsy slab...<br> ...getting cut open by scalpels<br> and chest spreaders...<br> ...and you're talking to me<br> about domestic fucking responsibility?<br> Good to see you, Theo.<br> Eve, just tell them what they want to know.<br> Who was she dating?<br> - We already told the Savages.<br> The Savage brothers?<br> - They were here yesterday.<br> Good, now try us out.<br> Who was she dating?<br> No one special.<br> You guys were having<br> a goodbye dinner, right?<br> What?<br> - She was leaving town, wasn't she?<br> Going to Las Vegas?<br> - How do you know?<br> She closed her bank account,<br> she had hotel phone numbers.<br> She wanted out of this dump.<br> She wanted to start a new life.<br> Well, a 19-year-old girl<br> doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.<br> So who was she going with?<br> Come on, girls.<br> Who was she going with?<br> Brendan.<br> Excuse me?<br> Brendan.<br> - Brendan Harris?<br> Brendan Harris, yeah.<br> You got an address?<br> Hey, Dave.<br> Hey, Jimmy.<br> Sorry, I came out for a smoke.<br> Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.<br> I haven't had a chance to talk to you all day.<br> How you doing?<br> How you doing?<br> What happened to your hand?<br> This?<br> I was helping a buddy move a couch.<br> I slammed it in the doorjamb.<br> Ways you can manage<br> to hurt yourself, right?<br> It's good to see you.<br> Yeah?<br> How are our girls holding up?<br> They're doing okay, I guess.<br> That Celeste, she's a godsend.<br> You thank her for me, will you?<br> It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.<br> Yeah.<br> I couldn't stand looking through the fridge<br> to find room for all that food...<br> ...we're gonna throw away<br> in the next few days.<br> Lot of waste, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> I just can't let anything get fucked up<br> in these next few days.<br> Because it's all anybody<br> will remember about her.<br> One thing you could say about Katie,<br> even when she was little...<br> ...that girl was neat.<br> When I got out of the joint...<br> ...you know, after Marita died...<br> ...I remember, I was more afraid<br> of my little daughter...<br> ...than I ever was of being in prison.<br> I loved her...<br> ...most...<br> ...because when we were sitting in that<br> kitchen that night...<br> ...it was like we were the last two people<br> on Earth. You know, forgotten.<br> Unwanted.<br> And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave,<br> because I can't cry for her.<br> My own little daughter,<br> and I can't even cry for her.<br> Jimmy.<br> You're crying now.<br> Yeah, damn.<br> I just want to hug her one more time.<br> She was 19 fucking years old.<br> Do you want me to leave you alone?<br> No, just stay here for a minute,<br> if that's cool.<br> Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.<br> When was the last time<br> you saw Katie Markum?<br> You don't think I'd hurt her do you?<br> - She isn't hurt. She's dead.<br> I didn't kill her.<br> - Again, when's the last time you saw her?<br> About 8...<br> Saturday night, about 8:00.<br> About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?<br> It was about 8.<br> We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,<br> and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.<br> Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum<br> like you?<br> I don't know.<br> But he told Katie he never wanted her<br> to see me or any other Harris.<br> What? That thief thinks he's better<br> than our family?<br> He's not a thief.<br> - He's a thief. A scumbag burglar.<br> Daughter probably had the same bad gene.<br> You count yourself lucky, Bren.<br> So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.<br> We heard she was going there with you.<br> We were gonna leave Sunday.<br> We were gonna get married<br> when we got there.<br> Well, that was the plan, right?<br> You were gonna leave me?<br> Without a word?<br> Ma, I was gonna tell you.<br> - Just like your father, huh?<br> That's my brother, Ray,<br> and his friend John.<br> Hey, boys.<br> - Hey.<br> He don't speak.<br> Father couldn't shut up, but his son's<br> a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.<br> They're here about Katie. Why don't you<br> go watch TV or something.<br> So where were you between 12:30<br> and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?<br> I was asleep.<br> Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?<br> I can confirm that he closed his door<br> at 10:00.<br> He came down for breakfast at 9.<br> I can't confirm that he didn't open<br> his window and go down the fire escape.<br> Okay, we're gonna ask you to take...<br> a polygraph. You think<br> you'd be up for that?<br> I loved her so much.<br> I'm never gonna feel that again.<br> It doesn't happen twice.<br> Doesn't happen once most times.<br> Celeste.<br> Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.<br> - What are you still doing here?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know, I just...<br> Did Annabeth get to sleep?<br> Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.<br> Could I get one of those?<br> - Yeah.<br> One for the road and then home.<br> Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.<br> Sit up with Annabeth.<br> You've done enough.<br> To you and Dave for being here for this.<br> Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.<br> I'll be by first thing tomorrow.<br> See you first thing.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> - Yeah, good night.<br> Hello?<br> Christ. Lauren, say something.<br> 'Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?'<br> Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things<br> made sense.<br> I'm tired of caring about<br> some dead girl, and...<br> there's just gonna be another one after her.<br> Sending killers to jail<br> is sending them where...<br> they've been heading all their lives.<br> The dead are still dead.<br> Jesus, I...<br> ...can't do this tonight.<br> I just...<br> I can't do it.<br> Bye, baby.<br> Because...<br> ...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.<br> He was the boy.<br> The boy who escaped from wolves.<br> An animal of the dusk.<br> Invisible.<br> Silent.<br> Living in a world...<br> ...the others never saw.<br> World of fireflies.<br> Unseen except as a flare<br> in the corner of your eye.<br> Vanished by the time<br> you turn your head toward it.<br> I just gotta get my head right.<br> Catch a nice, long sleep.<br> And the boy will go back to his forest.<br> Back to his fireflies.<br> Is he asleep?<br> How's Jimmy and everybody?<br> Okay.<br> It's weird.<br> Took something like this for me and him<br> to become friends again.<br> Dave? Dave.<br> There's still nothing in the paper.<br> About what?<br> About what?<br> I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't<br> hurt him as bad as I thought.<br> He's a mugger. He's not going<br> to the hospital.<br> Yeah.<br> Right.<br> Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?<br> I mean, Katie Markum is dead.<br> That seems more important right now.<br> I know in my soul I contributed<br> to your death.<br> But I don't know how.<br> Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.<br> Good. I didn't like him for it,<br> nor want him for it.<br> Yeah. Poor fucking kid.<br> Ballistics will be back in a while.<br> Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.<br> All people who, I'm certain,<br> are dying to cooperate.<br> Considering the crime, maybe.<br> Dave Boyle?<br> Hey, is that the guy you were friends<br> with as a kid? The car guy?<br> Could be.<br> He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.<br> He won't treat us like cops.<br> Clam up for no reason, huh?<br> - We'll see.<br> Hey, Boyle.<br> What's it been, seven, eight years?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah. How you doing?<br> This is my son, Michael.<br> Hey, Michael. How you doing?<br> My name's Sean.<br> I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.<br> So you still with the staties?<br> - Homicide. This is my partner.<br> Sergeant Powers. How are you?<br> - So you got a minute?<br> We'd love to ask some quick questions.<br> - I was just gonna walk Michael to school.<br> I can be back in a few minutes.<br> - Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?<br> Sure.<br> So you look good.<br> I hear rents are rising.<br> - Yeah, the yuppies are coming.<br> They're cutting my dad's old house up<br> into condos.<br> We walked by there the other day.<br> Must be something we could do<br> to stop them.<br> A friend of mine says the other day,<br> he says:<br> 'Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.<br> Get property values where they belong.'<br> Young girls keep getting<br> murdered up in Pen<br> Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.<br> Dave. Call me Dave.<br> You said the F-word, Dad.<br> Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.<br> Us guys need to talk. Go on.<br> So, what's up, Sean?<br> - Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?<br> Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.<br> Celeste is there now.<br> Who's Celeste?<br> - My wife.<br> How's Jimmy doing?<br> - It's hard to tell. You know him.<br> Yeah, so the reason we came by...<br> - Listen, I saw her.<br> Katie. I don't know if you know that.<br> At McGill's, the night she died.<br> That's what we wanted to talk about.<br> They were at a couple of bars that night.<br> Your name turned up for McGill's.<br> They put on quite a show<br> dancing on the bar.<br> Pretty drunk, huh?<br> - But it was harmless.<br> They weren't stripping or nothing.<br> They were just 19.<br> What time did they leave?<br> I left at 1. They must've left<br> So we'll say 12:45?<br> - Sounds about right.<br> You see anything unusual or anyone...?<br> Michael.<br> Like what?<br> - I don't know.<br> A guy watching the girls?<br> A guy with hate in his eyes?<br> A woman-hater?<br> No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,<br> it would've been business as usual.<br> See you later, Dad.<br> - You got your milk money?<br> Fuck, I hated school.<br> What?<br> Yeah, me too, Sean.<br> Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.<br> Where did you go after you left McGill's?<br> Home.<br> - Home by 1:15, would you say?<br> Roughly. Sure.<br> - All right.<br> Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.<br> We'll grab a beer sometime?<br> Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.<br> - All right.<br> What?<br> What happened to him in that car?<br> Can you believe this?<br> Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.<br> It costs 15 times the price.<br> You know, you take away love,<br> money or hate as motives...<br> ...you're not left with a whole lot.<br> Well, if this Markum thing's random,<br> I mean, shit.<br> Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,<br> Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.<br> Hears a gunshot,<br> before that a 'hi'...<br> ...which tells me the girl is either<br> friendly or she knew him.<br> She turns into the curb, not too fast or she<br> hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.<br> She says, 'Hi.' He shoots her.<br> - She slams the door into him, takes off.<br> What makes her swerve<br> without hitting the brakes?<br> I don't know. Something in the street.<br> - Maybe.<br> This Markum girl couldn't have<br> weighed more than what, 110?<br> She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?<br> - Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.<br> Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy<br> permanently back on his heels.<br> Wait a second, how did we get to<br> Dave Boyle all of a sudden?<br> We just got to him.<br> - He's a guy who was in the bar.<br> The last place, Seany,<br> the last place she was at.<br> The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.<br> Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously<br> want to take a look at Dave Boyle?<br> Just a little one.<br> I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,<br> from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.<br> Sure.<br> - Good.<br> Have you thought about flowers?<br> - I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.<br> Good.<br> And the notice?<br> Notice?<br> Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it<br> if you give us her basic information.<br> Or if you prefer donations<br> in lieu of flowers?<br> Where's my daughter?<br> Downstairs, in the basement.<br> I wanna see her.<br> I'm gonna find him, Katie.<br> I'm gonna find him before the police do.<br> I'm gonna find the man,<br> and I'm gonna kill him.<br> Did you say something, Mr. Markum?<br> The notice.<br> It should read: 'Katherine Markum...<br> ...beloved daughter<br> of James and Marita, deceased...<br> ...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to...'<br> 'Sister to Sara and Nadine.'<br> You guys again?<br> - Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.<br> You dropping in on Jimmy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Do you have some kind of, what,<br> break in the case?<br> No, just paying our respects.<br> Where you off to?<br> Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm<br> gonna go get some. See you in a minute.<br> By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened<br> to your hand there?<br> Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck<br> my hand in, it started again.<br> Stupid.<br> - Painful.<br> Garbage disposal. Bullshit.<br> Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean<br> he killed anybody either. Come on.<br> Heard you could use one.<br> - Thanks.<br> I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?<br> - Whatever you need right now.<br> Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.<br> I got a couple errands I gotta run.<br> I'll be back in an hour.<br> You don't have to come back, Celeste.<br> I'll be fine.<br> Sure?<br> - Celeste Boyle?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.<br> This is Whitey Powers.<br> Mrs. Boyle.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> Look, I gotta go.<br> Oh, damn it.<br> I left my report pad in the cruiser.<br> You better go get it.<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on.<br> Hey, Celeste, could I ask you<br> a quick question?<br> Me?<br> What time did Dave get home on Saturday?<br> What?<br> - It's a little thing.<br> We're running a time line on everything<br> involving Katie. I'm sure...<br> ...Dave told you he saw her at McGill's.<br> You think Dave killed Katie?<br> Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.<br> Why would I even think that?<br> I don't know.<br> - No, no. It's just that we could figure out...<br> ...what time she was on the road<br> if we knew what time Dave got home.<br> See, it's 5 minutes from your place<br> to McGill's...<br> ...and Katie left 15 minutes<br> before Dave did. You see what I mean.<br> I was asleep.<br> Saturday night, when Dave came in,<br> I was asleep.<br> Okay. Well, thanks.<br> Bullshit.<br> No, he was dating Katie, Jim.<br> They were gonna elope to Vegas.<br> We found tickets under their names.<br> Brendan Harris confirmed it.<br> Remember what you said?<br> How she looked at you on Saturday like<br> she was preparing to never see you again?<br> Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?<br> - No.<br> You're 100 percent sure?<br> Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it<br> seemed to me like he really loved her.<br> Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.<br> Why are you so dead set against that kid?<br> He said Katie told him you'd disowned her<br> if she ever dated a Harris.<br> I knew his father. They called him<br> 'Just Ray' Harris.<br> Why is that?<br> There were so many Rays<br> in the neighborhood.<br> You had 'Crazy Ray' Bucheck,<br> 'Psycho Ray' Dorian.<br> The cool names were taken,<br> so he got stuck with 'Just Ray.'<br> We never got along.<br> I flat out didn't like him.<br> And he cut out on his wife when she was<br> pregnant with that little mute of hers.<br> I don't know.<br> I just figure the apple doesn't fall<br> far from the tree.<br> I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris<br> dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.<br> I can't believe we're talking about<br> Just Ray Harris.<br> How about this? We've interviewed<br> witnesses...<br> ...canvassed people who were in the bar.<br> We've run into more than a few of them<br> who were questioned...<br> ...before us by one or more<br> of the Savage brothers.<br> So?<br> - So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.<br> Some people don't talk to policemen, Sean.<br> - With all due respect...<br> ...and just so we're clear,<br> this is our case.<br> How long?<br> - How long what?<br> How long before you catch<br> my daughter's killer?<br> You bargaining with us?<br> Bargaining?<br> You giving us a deadline?<br> We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.<br> If that's okay with you.<br> Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.<br> I'm not standing in your way.<br> The last thing we need is Markum<br> and the Savages putting the fear of God...<br> ...into the neighborhood.<br> - We grew up terrified of them.<br> Eleven months apart, like their mother ran<br> a loose-cannon factory.<br> Fucking knuckleheads.<br> Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.<br> Yeah, you got a match?<br> - You're gonna love it.<br> It's a perfect match.<br> Gun was a.38 Smith.<br> Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer<br> in New Hampshire in 1982.<br> The same gun that killed Katherine Markum<br> was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.<br> In Buckingham.<br> - The Flats?<br> Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.<br> I pulled the file.<br> It was a two-man job.<br> They fired a warning shot into a wall.<br> That's where the bullet got pulled.<br> - Nice work.<br> Thought you'd like that.<br> It's okay, Ray.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Ma said that?<br> That I'm better off?<br> I loved her. You know what that's like?<br> Huh?<br> I'm sorry.<br> No, you're wrong.<br> I won't ever feel that again.<br> Right there. Went in through a bottle<br> of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.<br> Scary, huh?<br> - Scarier than a glass of milk, right?<br> So take me through it.<br> These two guys come in...<br> In rubber masks.<br> They came in through here.<br> That's the storeroom.<br> There's a door back there<br> that leads to a loading dock.<br> I always keep that door locked.<br> So they must have had a key.<br> A key? So, what you're saying<br> is that it was an inside job?<br> It had to be. One of them, at least,<br> worked for me at some point.<br> The only reason they fired that goddamn<br> warning shot was they must have known...<br> ...I kept this under the counter.<br> And you told the police that at the time.<br> - Yeah.<br> Sure, they went through<br> my employment records.<br> Questioned everybody<br> who used to work for me.<br> Never made an arrest.<br> - Still have a copy of those records?<br> Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.<br> But I know who did it.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> This guy I fired a couple of weeks before.<br> Son of a bitch came in here<br> a few days after the robbery.<br> He had this fucking goddamn grin<br> on his face.<br> And I just knew.<br> Go tell a grin to a jury, right?<br> You remember his name?<br> Do I look senile to you?<br> No, sir.<br> - Name...<br> ...was Ray Harris.<br> We used to call him 'Just Ray.'<br> You say they used the same gun<br> for another crime?<br> That's correct, sir.<br> - Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.<br> Where you been?<br> Out.<br> What you watching?<br> Some vampire movie.<br> Guy just got his head torn off.<br> Where'd you go, Celeste?<br> I was sitting in my car...<br> ...down by the channel.<br> You know...<br> ...thinking about things.<br> What'd you think about?<br> - Oh, you know...<br> No, actually, I don't know.<br> Things. You know, the day.<br> About Katie being dead.<br> And poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know...<br> ...those things.<br> Those things.<br> Know what I was thinking about, huh?<br> Vampires.<br> What about them?<br> They're undead...<br> ...but I think maybe there's<br> something beautiful about it.<br> Maybe one day you wake up<br> and you forget what it's like...<br> ...to be human.<br> Maybe then it's okay.<br> What the fuck you talking about, Dave?<br> Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.<br> You're not making any sense.<br> You think I killed Katie?<br> Celeste.<br> - What...?<br> Is that the sense we're making these days?<br> - Where'd you come up with that?<br> You've barely looked at me since you found<br> out Katie was dead.<br> In fact, you seem repulsed by me.<br> Dave.<br> - What?<br> I don't think anything.<br> I'm confused, okay?<br> Even your friend Sean asked about...<br> He's not my friend, if you didn't know.<br> He asked me about you.<br> What time you came home.<br> What'd you tell him?<br> - I said I was asleep.<br> That's good thinking, baby.<br> - Jesus Christ, Dave.<br> Why don't you tell them about the mugger?<br> - The mugger?<br> The mugger. I see how<br> your mind's working. I do.<br> I come home with blood on me<br> the same night Katie's murdered.<br> I must have killed her, right?<br> Fuck.<br> Henry...<br> What? Henry?<br> Henry and George.<br> I never told anyone that before.<br> Those were their names.<br> Isn't that fucking hilarious?<br> At least that's what they called themselves,<br> but...<br> ...they were wolves, and Dave...<br> ...was the boy who escaped from wolves.<br> What are you talking about, Dave?<br> I'm talking Henry and George.<br> They took me on a four-day ride.<br> They buried me in this ratty old cellar<br> with a sleeping bag.<br> And, man, Celeste...<br> ...did they have their fun.<br> And no one came to help old Dave then.<br> Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.<br> You mean, all those years ago...<br> ...when you were a little boy?<br> Dave...<br> Dave's dead.<br> I don't know who came out of that cellar,<br> but it sure as shit wasn't Dave.<br> You see, honey...<br> Fuck.<br> It's like vampires.<br> Once it's in you...<br> ...it stays.<br> What stays?<br> Did you know there were child prostitutes<br> in Rome Basin?<br> What?<br> Fuck.<br> I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.<br> I'm warning you...<br> ...I can't trust my mind.<br> I gotta go out,<br> try to get my head around it.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> The gun sends us in a different direction.<br> - I don't see it that way.<br> What does Just Ray's gun<br> have to do with Dave?<br> These things get passed around.<br> Just Ray may have blown town,<br> but his gun never did.<br> I say we talk with Brendan Harris<br> in the morning.<br> And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.<br> The wife, she's definitely scared.<br> They're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's<br> as much a killer as Brendan Harris.<br> Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.<br> Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...<br> ...sexually abused as a kid.<br> On paper, this guy should be in jail already.<br> Katie Markum<br> was not sexually abused, see?<br> In that equation,<br> sexual emission is part of the deal.<br> You were friends when you were kids.<br> This makes you a fucking liability.<br> He's not my friend.<br> Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs<br> off my hip faster than yours.<br> Hey, Jimmy.<br> You're out late.<br> Yeah, you too.<br> It's cold, huh?<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> You know, I...<br> I been sitting out here...<br> ...over the last few years...<br> ...waiting on Katie to get back<br> from someplace.<br> About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,<br> 'I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while.'<br> Weird thing is...<br> ...it seemed to bring her back.<br> I saw her, you know.<br> Saw who?<br> Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.<br> You saw Katie Saturday night?<br> - Never got around to telling you.<br> Did you talk to her?<br> Just nodded hello at one point.<br> Next time I looked up, she was gone.<br> But...<br> ...Jimmy...<br> ...she looked...<br> ...happy.<br> I got more walking to do.<br> Good night.<br> You stole his car.<br> - His car was officially towed.<br> From the front of his house.<br> - No. It was abandoned in Rome Basin...<br> ...adjacent to the parkway.<br> Lucky for us, the parkway's state<br> jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...<br> ...they took it for a joy ride...<br> - What? Why'd you do it?<br> After I left you last night, I decided to talk<br> to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.<br> I get to his house, I decide to look in<br> his car, see what he's got. I find blood.<br> Blood?<br> - Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.<br> How much?<br> - A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.<br> Type O, same type as Katie Markum.<br> Wait, Katie Markum<br> never got in anybody's trunk.<br> She was chased through the park<br> where she died.<br> It's enough to ask questions.<br> - Your search is gonna get tossed out.<br> No, found and abandoned in state<br> jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.<br> In the best interest of the owner.<br> - Get a physical search, file the report.<br> Bingo.<br> You wanna talk to him,<br> or should I send him home?<br> Dave's here?<br> - I've had him in the box for an hour.<br> Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers<br> to pick him up.<br> Come on, Mr. Boyle.<br> We know you didn't get that swollen hand<br> sticking it in the garbage disposal.<br> Oh, yeah? How do you know that?<br> - Why's your wife afraid of you?<br> She know what really happened<br> to your hand?<br> How about a Sprite or something?<br> How about you tell us what really happened<br> Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?<br> You lied.<br> That's your opinion,<br> which you're entitled to.<br> Hey, you think this is funny?<br> - No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.<br> Not only was my car stolen last night,<br> but now you won't release it to me.<br> Okay.<br> All right.<br> Tell us, Mr. Boyle,<br> how did you get the blood in your car?<br> What blood?<br> - Let's start with the front seat.<br> What are you looking at him for?<br> Hey, you think I could get<br> that Sprite, Sean?<br> Sure.<br> Oh, I get it.<br> You're the good cop.<br> How about a meatball sub<br> while you're at it?<br> I ain't your bitch, Dave.<br> Looks like you'll have to wait.<br> Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,<br> aren't you, Sean?<br> The blood on your front seat, Dave.<br> Answer the sergeant.<br> We got a chainlink fence in our back yard.<br> Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball<br> every afternoon after school.<br> He's getting good, so most of the balls<br> are on the other side of the fence.<br> So I climb it.<br> Except I slip...<br> ...slice myself where the links curl in,<br> right here.<br> Bled like hell.<br> Ten minutes later,<br> I gotta pick up Michael at school.<br> Probably was still bleeding<br> when I got in the front seat.<br> What blood type are you?<br> B-negative.<br> Yeah? That's the match we got.<br> Well, there you go.<br> - Not quite.<br> Blood in the trunk of the car<br> wasn't B-negative.<br> I don't know anything<br> about any blood in the trunk.<br> No idea how half a pint of blood<br> got in the trunk?<br> None.<br> - This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.<br> How will that look in court?<br> You not knowing how<br> someone else's blood...<br> got in the trunk of your car?<br> Gonna look fine, I suppose.<br> You filed the report.<br> What report?<br> The stolen-car report.<br> The car wasn't in my possession last night.<br> So whatever the thieves used it for,<br> you should find out...<br> ...because it sounds like they<br> were up to no good.<br> Things looking any better<br> on the Sprite, Sean?<br> Well, you just got too fucking smart.<br> The car is inadmissible.<br> Anything there, his lawyers say<br> was put by thieves.<br> I can break him.<br> - He just kicked our asses.<br> You still think Dave wouldn't hurt a fly...<br> Is that the point? No.<br> - What is the point?<br> We can break this open on the gun.<br> It's the gun.<br> Okay. Maybe.<br> So, what do we do with Dave?<br> Fuck it. Kick him loose.<br> Maybe a Celtic cross.<br> That's always a popular choice.<br> Or this lovely red marble here.<br> Or a figural.<br> That one.<br> Very good. Nice and simple.<br> Hey, Jimmy.<br> Annabeth said you were here.<br> We been asking around, like you said to.<br> Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit<br> you did for me.<br> And it ain't about me missing your brains<br> running things.<br> Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but<br> she was part of our family, we loved her.<br> I don't question you, Val.<br> What's up?<br> Cops are all over this. Doing their job<br> for once. Bars, street trade, everything.<br> Every hooker we talked to, bartender,<br> already been questioned.<br> The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.<br> - What about Just Ray's kid?<br> Quiet as a mouse.<br> Kid's no trouble to anyone.<br> I talked to Diane and Eve.<br> They said he loved her.<br> Jimmy, they said that she loved him.<br> Want us to take a run at him?<br> - No.<br> Hold off for now.<br> Anything else?<br> What?<br> Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.<br> Tell him.<br> Sean Devine and his partner<br> went by and saw Dave Boyle.<br> Dave was at McGill's. Probably<br> questioning him like everybody else.<br> I heard something else this morning too.<br> Two staties came by in uniform.<br> - Maybe they forgot to ask him something.<br> No. When they left,<br> they took him with them.<br> They put him in the back seat,<br> if you know what I mean.<br> 'Raymond Matthew Harris,<br> born 9-6, 1957.<br> First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983.'<br> Same year that Just Ray is indicted<br> in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.<br> Charges are dropped, and he's fired.<br> Does odd jobs after that,<br> including clerking at Looney Liquors.<br> Questioned in that robbery. Questioned<br> in another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...<br> ...released on lack of evidence again.<br> Beginning to become known, though.<br> - He's getting popular.<br> 'A known associate, one Edmund Reese,<br> fingers Raymond...<br> ...in the 1985 heist<br> of a rare comic-book collection.'<br> Comic books? You go, Ray.<br> Hey, excuse me,<br> $150,000 worth of comic books.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> 'Raymond returned said literature<br> unharmed.' Does a year solid inside.<br> Comes out with a chemical-dependency<br> problem.<br> Gets honest work<br> to support the habit, though?<br> Evidently not.<br> Picked up in a joint<br> MCU-FBI sting operation...<br> ...trafficking stolen goods across<br> state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.<br> The boy's got style.<br> - Got a boatload of grief too.<br> Stole the truck in Rhode Island,<br> drove it into Massachusetts.<br> Hence, the federal interstate rap.<br> - Hence, they got him by the balls, but...<br> ...he does no time.<br> He rolled on someone.<br> - Looks that way. After that, he's clean.<br> August 1989, he disappears.<br> One, he's dead, two, in Witness Protection.<br> Three, he goes deep underground,<br> then pops back up...<br> ...to murder his son's 19-year-old girlfriend?<br> We got nothing.<br> A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years ago,<br> during which the murder<br> weapon was used.<br> The guy's son dated the victim.<br> I say we got a lot.<br> Anything about Just Ray's<br> known associates?<br> Let's take a look.<br> 'Known criminal associates:<br> Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin<br> 'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...<br> ...Anthony Waxman.'<br> And one James Markum.<br> And the hits just keep on coming.<br> You looking for me?<br> - I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.<br> I already gotta get back.<br> So you worked a task force<br> with Major Crimes in the '80s?<br> Bunch of them.<br> - You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.<br> He stole a truckload of cigarettes<br> from a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.<br> Trucker went to take a piss,<br> Harris guy jacks the truck.<br> Think we pulled him over in New Bedford.<br> - But Harris walked.<br> He didn't walk, he rolled.<br> Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in<br> for info on another case. He rolled.<br> On who?<br> What the fuck was the name?<br> Him and three other guys knocked over<br> the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.<br> Jimmy Markum.<br> Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.<br> Ran a crew, never got arrested.<br> So did Harris ever testify in open court?<br> Never went. Markum dummied up<br> on the guys he was working with...<br> ...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able<br> to convict. So he cut a deal.<br> Two years inside,<br> couple more suspended.<br> So Jimmy Markum never knew<br> that Ray Harris ratted him out?<br> Ray Harris disappeared<br> about two months...<br> ...after Markum rotated back<br> into the free world.<br> What's that tell you?<br> Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.<br> Hey, coz, how you doing?<br> - I'm good.<br> Okay. Hey.<br> Hey, Celeste.<br> - Hey, Jimmy. Hey.<br> Can I talk to you for a sec?<br> - I'll catch up with you in a minute.<br> Step into my office.<br> Beautiful day, huh?<br> Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.<br> I took Michael last night...<br> ...and I went to a motel.<br> Okay.<br> I don't know, Jim.<br> I might have left Dave for good.<br> You left Dave?<br> Yeah.<br> Well...<br> ...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.<br> I'm almost afraid of him.<br> Do you know something?<br> I know he was taken in by the cops<br> this morning.<br> He saw Katie the night she was murdered.<br> Didn't tell me...<br> ...till after the cops questioned him.<br> I know he's got a hand that looks like<br> it's been punching a fucking wall.<br> Is there anything else I should know?<br> Come here.<br> Okay.<br> At 3 in the morning...<br> ...on Sunday, Dave came back to the...<br> apartment covered in<br> someone else's blood.<br> What did he say happened?<br> That he was mugged.<br> That he...<br> He bashed the mugger's head in the street.<br> That...<br> That he might have killed him.<br> But there was nothing in the paper.<br> Celeste?<br> - Yeah?<br> Celeste?<br> - Yeah?<br> Celeste?<br> Do you think Dave killed my Katie?<br> Okay. All right.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, God.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Tell me about your father, Brendan.<br> - What?<br> Your father, Ray Sr.<br> You remember him.<br> I was 6 when he left us.<br> - So you don't remember the guy?<br> I remember little things.<br> He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.<br> He...<br> He what?<br> He carried a lot of change in his pocket.<br> It jingled when he walked.<br> You could always hear him coming home.<br> And if I guessed how much he had,<br> even if I was close, he'd give it to me.<br> You remember your father having a gun?<br> No.<br> Well, you seem awfully sure for somebody<br> who was 6 when he left.<br> What's up?<br> What's that?<br> - This is what you asked for.<br> CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint analysis,<br> the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.<br> All right, thanks.<br> We were talking about your father's gun.<br> I told you, my father didn't have a gun.<br> - Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.<br> When was the last time you talked to him?<br> - Never.<br> Never?<br> He went out for a drink<br> and never came back.<br> But your mother never filed<br> a missing person's report. Why not?<br> Because he's not missing.<br> He sends money every month.<br> - Sends money?<br> Five hundred bucks every month.<br> Like clockwork.<br> From where?<br> - Postmark says Brooklyn.<br> How do you know it's him?<br> - Who else would it be?<br> Who else would send it?<br> My ma says that's the way he was.<br> Do something shitty,<br> then he'd try to make up for it.<br> Why do you keep asking me<br> if my father had a gun?<br> You know why, kid.<br> No, I don't.<br> Gun that killed your girlfriend...<br> ...was the same gun your father used<br> in a robbery 18 years ago.<br> So...<br> ...you wanna tell me about it?<br> My father didn't have a gun.<br> You are fucking lying.<br> Can I go now?<br> Or are you gonna charge me<br> with Katie's murder?<br> Hey. Dandy Dave Boyle,<br> how's it hanging?<br> Hey, Val.<br> Nick. How you guys holding up?<br> All right.<br> - It's fucked up.<br> Katie.<br> A fucking tragedy.<br> Yeah.<br> We're gonna get a couple of beers<br> and a bite to eat.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah. What do you say, man?<br> How about a boys' night out<br> in the middle of the day?<br> I gotta get home after a while.<br> - Don't we all? Hop in.<br> Come on, get in.<br> - All right.<br> Well, the first round's on me.<br> Now you're talking.<br> I think the kid is lying about the gun.<br> - Absolutely. I told you three times already.<br> What about the father?<br> - I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is still alive.<br> Eighty grand. I mean...<br> ...who else is gonna send<br> that kind of money if not the father?<br> Listen, go home, have a drink.<br> Let it go for a while.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, anything good on the 911?<br> I thought you listened to it.<br> - I thought you listened to it.<br> What's the nature of your emergency?<br> There's, like, this car with blood in it,<br> and the door's open.<br> What's the location of the car?<br> - Sydney Street.<br> It's in the Flats by Pen Park.<br> Me and my friend, we just found it.<br> Son, what's your name?<br> - He wants to know her name.<br> Your name, what's your name?<br> - We're so fucking out of here.<br> Good luck, man.<br> That about cracks the case, don't it?<br> Let's get a burger or something.<br> Her.<br> What?<br> - The kid on the tape.<br> Son, what's your name?<br> - He wants to know her name.<br> He said, 'Her name.'<br> She's a dead girl, you refer to her as a she.<br> How does the kid know?<br> Girl's dead in the park.<br> How does he know the blood in the car<br> came from a woman?<br> Play it again.<br> This one time, we're going<br> to take down this stamp collector.<br> Tie him up, rob him, we're out.<br> - Here.<br> It was me, Nicky and this kid<br> Carson Leverett.<br> Fucking Carson.<br> I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own<br> fucking shoe if you didn't show him.<br> We all wear suits because we want to fit in.<br> We're in the elevator, it stops, this old<br> lady gets on. She starts fucking screaming.<br> Now Val turns to me,<br> but I'm looking at Carson.<br> I'm thinking, 'What the fuck?'<br> Because that fucking bonehead's<br> still got his Ronald Reagan mask on.<br> Fucking smiley mask.<br> Idiot.<br> And you guys didn't notice till then?<br> Shit like that happened all the time on jobs.<br> That's why Jimmy was so missed.<br> He saw shit happen<br> before it even went down.<br> Why do you think he went straight?<br> One word, pure and simple. Katie.<br> What about you guys?<br> What? Us? Going straight?<br> That's pretty fucking funny.<br> We're like bats, we like the night too much.<br> Days are just good for sleeping through.<br> Want another shot?<br> You know, I should slow down till we eat.<br> - Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us.<br> Come on, get up.<br> Live a little, huh?<br> Slide over, Dave.<br> Dave.<br> - All right, Val. Now you're talking.<br> How you doing?<br> - I'm a little drunk.<br> To our children.<br> I always liked this bar.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, nobody bothers you.<br> The way it should be,<br> nobody to bother you in this life.<br> No one fucking with you<br> or your loved ones. Right, Dave?<br> Absolutely.<br> - Absolutely.<br> This guy's a hoot.<br> He can really get you going.<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, yeah, my man Dave.<br> Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?<br> Drink up, Dave.<br> - Come on.<br> Thanks, Kevin.<br> Remember we took Ray Harris here<br> that time?<br> Everybody called this guy 'Just Ray,'<br> but Val here called him 'Ray Jingles.'<br> This guy walked around<br> with 10 bucks in change...<br> ...in case he had to make a call<br> to Iraq or something.<br> Are you all right, Dave? Dave?<br> You all right?<br> - Shit. I'm gonna be sick.<br> Come on. Come on, now.<br> Dave, use the back door. Huey<br> don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.<br> Hey, Ray.<br> You guys come to make sure I didn't fall in?<br> Come here a second.<br> Sit down.<br> Let me tell you about Ray Harris.<br> He was a buddy of mine.<br> He used to visit me in prison.<br> He checked in on Marita and Katie,<br> my mother, if they needed anything.<br> He's also the one who put me in.<br> He ratted me out.<br> That's terrible.<br> - My wife had cancer at the time.<br> I remember.<br> - Ray robbed me of being with her...<br> ...when she was dying.<br> The death part you do alone,<br> but I could have helped her with the dying.<br> Why are you telling me this?<br> I knelt Ray down over there and<br> I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.<br> We were both crying when I did it.<br> - Jimmy...<br> He was begging.<br> You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.<br> He said he knew me.<br> He said I was a good man.<br> What do you think, Dave?<br> You think I'm a good man?<br> Who do you hate?<br> Come on, who?<br> No one.<br> What is it you think I did?<br> - As I was holding him under the water...<br> ...I could feel God watching me,<br> shaking his head. Not angry...<br> ...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.<br> Who do you love?<br> You love me.<br> What about Ma?<br> You love me so much,<br> I wanna hear you say it.<br> You think I killed Katie, don't you?<br> - Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.<br> No, I killed someone,<br> but I didn't kill Katie.<br> This is the mugger story.<br> He wasn't a mugger, a child molester.<br> He was having sex with this kid in his car.<br> He was a fucking wolf.<br> He was a vampire.<br> Get out of here.<br> Run.<br> Dave, run.<br> You killed a child molester.<br> - Yeah. Well, me and the boy.<br> The molested boy helped you.<br> - Oh, no. No...<br> You just said you and the boy.<br> - No, forget that.<br> My head gets fucked up sometimes.<br> - Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.<br> Rather have her think that<br> than you killed a child molester?<br> People don't care if a child molester dies.<br> Why not tell the truth?<br> I don't know. Maybe I thought<br> I was turning into him.<br> I didn't kill Katie.<br> I don't remember hearing anything about<br> any guy's body being found.<br> I put him in the trunk of my car.<br> - Letting this piece of shit explain himself?<br> Fuck him. Fuck him. Do him.<br> - I didn't kill her.<br> Shut up.

Me and Celeste. There's<br> so many things we gotta make right.<br> Make it right now. Start now.<br> Admit what you did.<br> No more lies, no more secrets.<br> I wanna go home to Celeste.<br> I wanna feel Celeste.<br> Right after you do your time. I did mine,<br> you do yours. Admit what you did.<br> The boy...<br> - One more time about the boy...<br> ...and I will open you the fuck up.<br> I thought I was finished with all this.<br> I mean, killing people<br> and dumping them in the river.<br> You admit what you did, Dave,<br> and I'm gonna let you live.<br> Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.<br> Admit what you did,<br> and I will give you your life.<br> Admit what you did, Dave.<br> Admit what you did.<br> Admit what you did.<br> Admit what you did.<br> I know you can speak.<br> So say it.

Admit it.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I did it.<br> Why?<br> Why?<br> That night in McGill's...<br> ...she reminded me of a dream I had.<br> What dream?<br> A dream of youth.<br> I don't remember having one.<br> So it was the dream?<br> The dream, yeah.<br> You'd know what I mean<br> if you'd got in that car instead of me.<br> But I didn't get in that car, Dave.<br> Hang on. Come here. You did.<br> We bury our sins here, Dave.<br> We wash them clean.<br> Look, his fucking lips are still moving.<br> - I got eyes, Val.<br> I wasn't ready.<br> It's like I said, Dave.<br> This part, you do alone.<br> Tough night?<br> Yeah, me too.<br> Saw a bullet with my name on it.<br> We got them, Jim.<br> Got who?<br> Katie's killers. Got them cold.<br> Killers, plural.<br> Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son<br> Ray Jr. and another kid, John O'Shea.<br> They just confessed a couple hours ago.<br> No doubt?<br> None.<br> Why?<br> They don't know.<br> They were playing with a gun,<br> saw a car coming...<br> ...one of the kids lies down in the street,<br> car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.<br> O'Shea says they just meant to scare her<br> and the gun went off.<br> But she hit him with her door, ran...<br> ...and they chased her<br> so she wouldn't tell anyone.<br> And the beating they gave her?<br> Ray Jr. had a hockey stick.<br> All right. Go easy.<br> Take a breath.<br> Look at me.<br> Look at me, Jimmy.<br> I got a call from Celeste Boyle.<br> She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,<br> says you might know where he is.<br> We need to talk to him.<br> Boston P.D. found the body of a guy<br> in the woods behind McGill's.<br> A body? The body of a guy?<br> Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.<br> They want to talk to Dave about it.<br> So, Jimmy...<br> ...when was the last time you saw Dave?<br> The last time I saw Dave.<br> Yeah. Dave Boyle.<br> Dave Boyle.<br> - Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.<br> That was 25 years ago,<br> going up this street in the back of that car.<br> Jimmy, what did you do?<br> Thanks for finding<br> my daughter's killers, Sean.<br> If only you'd been a little faster.<br> Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle<br> Sometimes I think...<br> I think all three of us got in that car.<br> And all of this is just a dream, you know?<br> A dream, sure.<br> In reality...<br> ...we're still 11 -year-old boys<br> locked in a cellar...<br> ...imagining what our<br> lives would have been...<br> if we'd escaped.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Who the fuck knows?<br> Yeah, this is Sean.<br> I'm sorry. I need you to know that.<br> I pushed you away.<br> I'm sorry too.<br> Things have been so messed up.<br> Loving you, hating you.<br> Come home?<br> You change the locks or anything?<br> No.<br> No, everything is just the way you left it.<br> Nora.<br> - What's that?<br> Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.<br> Nora, huh?<br> Well, I like that. Nora.<br> I killed Dave.<br> I killed him, and I threw him in the Mystic.<br> But I killed the wrong man.<br> That's what I've done.<br> And I can't undo it.<br> Jimmy.<br> I wanna feel your heart.<br> Last night...<br> ...when I put the girls to bed,<br> I told them how big your heart was.<br> I told them how much you loved Katie...<br> - Annabeth.<br> ...because you created her.<br> And sometimes,<br> your love for her was so big...<br> ...felt like your heart was gonna explode...<br> - Please stop.<br> I told them their daddy<br> loved them that much too.<br> That he had four hearts,<br> and they were all filled up...<br> ...and aching with a love that meant<br> we would never have to worry.<br> And that their daddy would do<br> whatever he had to for those he loved.<br> And that is never wrong.<br> That can never be wrong,<br> no matter what their daddy had to do.<br> And those girls fell asleep at peace.<br> You said, 'Last night.' You knew?<br> Celeste called, looking for you.<br> She was worried something might happen.<br> She told me about Dave.<br> Told me what she told you.<br> What kind of wife...<br> ...says that about her husband?<br> And why'd she run to you?<br> Why didn't you call?<br> - Because it's like I told the girls.<br> Their daddy's a king.<br> And a king knows what to do and does it.<br> Even when it's hard.<br> And their daddy will do<br> whatever he has to for those he loves.<br> And that's all that matters.<br> Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.<br> Everyone but us.<br> We will never be weak.<br> And you...<br> You could rule this town.<br> And after, Jimmy...<br> ...let's take the girls down to the parade.<br> Katie would have liked that.<br> Michael.<br> Michael. Michael.<br> Michael.<br> Michael.<br>
