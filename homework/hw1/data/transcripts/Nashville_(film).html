Yes, that's sweet.<br> [Man] Who writes your material, darlin'?<br> Barnett, who are all those people inside there?<br> That's just airport security, 'cause of all the hijackers.<br> - Did they come to see me?<br> - They can see you pretty good.<br> Then I'd like to go in and say hello.<br> [Pearl] Aww, that's so sweet!<br> Barnett, I'm sorry, darlin'.<br> [Reporter] This is a little bit unscheduled.<br> She's on her way to greet some of the fans that are inside there.<br> - Stepping on down with Barnett.<br> - Watch out for the water.<br> [Pearl] That was real nice.<br> Right behind, Haven Hamilton and all the other friends, members and, uh...<br> - [Woman Screams]<br> - She's fallen!<br> Harold, come on! She's fallen somewhere down there!<br> - If we can get down there...<br> - [Shouting, Screaming]<br> Don't know how far we can make it.<br> [Walker On P.A.] Who do you think is running Congress?<br> Farmers? Engineers? Teachers? Businessmen?<br> No, my friends, Congress is run by lawyers.<br> A lawyer is trained for two things and two things only:<br> - [Siren Wailing]<br> - To clarify... that's one...<br> and to confuse... that's the other thing.<br> He does whichever is to his client's advantage.<br> You ever ask a lawyer the time of day?<br> He told you how to make a watch, didn't he?<br> Ever ask a lawyer how to get to Mr. Jones'house in the country?<br> You got lost, didn't you?<br> Congress is composed of 535 individuals.<br> Two hundred and eighty-eight are lawyers.<br> And you wonder what's wrong in Congress.<br> No wonder we often know how to make a watch,<br> but we don't know the time of day.<br> - No wonder it takes 6 or 7 years...<br> - [Man Shouting, Hooting]<br> [Walker Continues, Faint]<br> What the hell is the matter with you?<br> [Walker Continues On P.A.] Yes, I'm talking about replacement...<br> replacing this lawyeristic, red-taped...<br> and blank-taped government...<br> with the yes-and-no language of farmers and teachers,<br> engineers and businessmen.<br> I'm not pessimistic about this country.<br> She finally collapsed here on the sidewalk. Sort of a faint.<br> That's all we've been able to determine at this moment.<br> We interviewed Mr. Sperry. He said the same thing.<br> Haven Hamilton said the same thing as well.<br> That's about it for the moment from Metro Airport.<br> For Channel Two News, this is Bill Jenkins reporting.<br> [Walker On P.A.] Let's consider our national anthem.<br> Nobody knows the words.<br> Nobody can sing it.<br> Nobody understands it.<br> [Walker Continues] I suppose all the lawyers supported it...<br> because a lawyer wrote the words and a judge wrote the tune.<br> Careful, Buddy.<br> - Read it through carefully.<br> - Watch out for that truck.<br> And I say read it because I know you can't sing it.<br> Read all four verses and you'll understand what I'm talking about.<br> Yes, sir, I would support work and vote for replacement.<br> Change our national anthem...<br> - This is terrific, Norman.<br> - To something people understand,<br> back to something that would make a light shine in their faces.<br> Hey, man, get off my car!<br> Don't lean on my car!<br> I just got this goddamn thing fixed, so don't lean on it now.<br> Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, God.<br> Hey, man, get the hell off my car!<br> [Wade] You almost made me fall!<br> Okay, thanks. You got one too?<br> Thanks a lot. Just keep those cards and letters comin' in, folks.<br> - I cannot. I feel faint.<br> - I'm gonna get us a Popsicle.<br> - H-Hello!<br> - Those mangled bodies.<br> Would you go to that Popsicle truck and get us a couple of sweet ices?<br> There must be 20 cars piled up, one on top of the other.<br> - Oh, now, come on.<br> - I saw a leg sticking out.<br> This is gonna be a mess. I don't know how long it, uh...<br> Can you just pull on through where the ambulance went through?<br> You wanna come on in and try it?<br> - What's the matter, son?<br> - I'm stalled.<br> - What did you want? Popsicle?<br> - I wish my cameraman had been here.<br> He's never around. I need something like this for my documentary.<br> I need it. It's... It's America.<br> Those cars smashing into each other...<br> and all those mangled corpses...<br> Just a minute now. Just a minute.<br> - [Radio: Country]<br> - Aren't there any rock stations?<br> Well, hard to really say.<br> You see, after they opened her up...<br> they figured they oughta do an exploratory.<br> You know, give her kind of an overhaul.<br> - Twenty dollars?<br> - Twenty dollars.<br> - I'll give you five.<br> - No, I'll take 15.<br> You'll take 15? I'll give you ten.<br> [Walker] I can think of no sensible reason why New York...<br> must of necessity have 12,000 major crimes committed...<br> for every 1,000 committed in Tokyo.<br> - Yet these are the true victims.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Some very funny notions have developed in American politics.<br> Let me see. Um, have you any children?<br> Yes, I have two children. I have a boy and a girl.<br> Oh, isn't that nice. How old are they?<br> Twelve and eleven.<br> Do they want to be singers like their mummy?<br> Uh, well, my children are deaf.<br> They're... They are deaf. They were born deaf.<br> Oh, my God, how awful.<br> - It's so depressing.<br> - Now, just a minute. That's not so.<br> - I wish you could see my boy.<br> - Oh, I couldn't.<br> He has the most incredible personality.<br> It's the sadness of it.<br> See, what happened is, he made a million dollars on a fly swatter,<br> because it had a red dot in the center.<br> - Fly swatter?<br> - That's right. Just a red dot.<br> He was sittin' in the buffet, he was eatin', and he saw a woman...<br> and she was swattin' flies.<br> And, uh, she... Uh, he said,<br> "What makes the difference in fly swatters?"<br> 'Cause it has to do with the industrial revolution.<br> The thing with these country people is,<br> they have a real grassroots appeal.<br> Oh, hell, they got fans.<br> And they're the people that elect the president.<br> We're gonna do everything we can.<br> You line up a lot of movie stars...<br> People here feel that movie stars are eccentric and crazy.<br> - Communists.<br> - Well... [Laughing]<br> - A lot of'em are.<br> - It's been said.<br> - I want to go to the Grand Ole Opry.<br> - Forget that.<br> - 'Cause I have to have my record...<br> - I don't like music.<br> - I'm gonna go see what's goin' on.<br> - I have a gold record.<br> - It needs to be signed.<br> - Get away from my truck!<br> - Goddamn it. Sons of bitches.<br> - Shit.<br> I say, could I please speak to Mr. Tommy Brown?<br> I'm sorry. What?<br> Is it possible to have a few words with Mr. Tommy Brown?<br> I'm from the BBC. I'm doing a documentary on Nashville.<br> What is the BBC?<br> - British Broadcasting Company.<br> - Oh, English.<br> It was called "Wanda, Wander."<br> No, that song was called "Wonder, Wanda."<br> - Wanda, wander's got me bad<br> - I don't have a pen.<br> - No... Wonder, Wanda's got me bad<br> - I keep travelin'<br> And I'm sad Buddy, Buddy, which was it?<br> - I don't really know.<br> - Thank you, thank you.<br> - Goddamn it, it was "Wanda, Wander."<br> - It was "Wonder, Wanda."<br> - "Wanda, Wander"! "Wanda, Wander"!<br> - "Wonder, Wanda."<br> What difference does it make? It was a hit!<br> [Walker On P.A.] There's no breathing space.<br> What we need, first and foremost,<br> is a common-sense approach.<br> Nothing complicated.<br> Is Mr. Brown going to... Will he be here soon?<br> Yeah, he's in the back changin'.<br> Whenever he's going to have an interview, he puts his makeup on...<br> and likes to get all prettied up.<br> [Laughing] That's nice.<br> He must be a marvelous person...<br> to have all you lovely people working for him.<br> I know the problems in the South. I mean, I've heard of them.<br> [Chuckles] Well, yeah.<br> - He's a very liberal guy.<br> - Oh, that's lovely.<br> By the way, I'd like for you to meet his wife. This is Joy.<br> - Mrs. Brown?<br> - Yes.<br> [Gospel Choir] You may say that I ain't free<br> But it don't worry me<br> No, it don't...<br> [Walker On P.A.] Today in America,<br> with its unmatched resources,<br> it is exceedingly ridiculous,<br> a total absurdity...<br> that any citizen with any ailment, mental or physical,<br> should go medically unattended.<br> We're settin' up everything for you.<br> - We got pictures the right height.<br> - Oh, yeah, the bird again.<br> Isn't that beautiful. I remember when you gave that to me.<br> I remember I almost threw it out. [Laughs]<br> Good afternoon, girls.<br> I'd like you to wait outside the room a while...<br> because I know Aunt Esther would like to fix herself up a little.<br> I want my dog. Where is my dog?<br> - I'm sorry. I've got a date.<br> - You do?<br> [Laughs]<br> - I just need one shot.<br> - I'm sorry. Could you excuse us?<br> - Come right on in, sir.<br> - How you doin', Howard?<br> I'm sorry.

Nice to see you.<br> You look as beautiful as a big black butterfly.<br> I'm gettin' jealous.

You got two seconds.<br> - Can I have a light?<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Can I have a light?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> The incident you described just now is very similar...<br> to what was diagnosed as some kind of intestinal disorder.<br> - [L.A.

How are you, Connie?<br> - Hi, Barnett.<br> Now, the problem we got here...<br> is anti-Catholicism.<br> These dumbheads around here, they're all...<br> Baptists and whatever, I don't know.<br> [Stammers] Even to teach 'em to make change over the bar...<br> you gotta crack their skulls,<br> let alone teach 'em to vote for the Catholic...<br> just because he happens to be the better man.<br> [Laughs] Here, this is just somethin'...<br> somethin' that Barbara Jean told me to pick up for you.<br> - You shouldn't have done that.<br> - I know, but she told me.<br> - I told her I shouldn't have.<br> - Did you get the flowers we sent?<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Appreciate it.<br> Thank you very much.<br> As most of you might have noticed,<br> we have a celebrity with us tonight.<br> If we get our hands together, we might could get a song.<br> - Miss Connie White.<br> - From the goodness of her heart.<br> - [Loud Applause]<br> - What do you want, a few bucks?<br> You holdin' out for somethin' better?<br> You're a real sweetie pie.<br> Thank you very much.<br> That's what I love about this place. Can you see me?<br> I can't see you.<br> - That was a nice gesture.<br> - I'm gonna sing something you know.<br> - What was a nice gesture?<br> - Join me on the choruses.<br> Don't seem to be appreciated, do it?<br> - "Rolling Stone."<br> - [Cheers, Applause]<br> Thank you.<br> You walked me, sweet Joshua<br> Down the country lane<br> You brought me, sweet Joshua<br> Where the roses grow so tall<br> You lay me down, Joshua<br> And you promised me your name<br> And after that<br> That was all<br> That was all<br> Everybody!<br> [Connie, Audience] Rolling stone, Rolling stone<br> - Gathers no moss<br> - Who wrote that song, a kid?<br> And all I remember the next few days was...<br> I was just lookin' at that TV set and seein' it all,<br> seein' that great fat-bellied sheriff...<br> sayin', "Ruby, you son of a bitch."<br> And Oswald...<br> and her in her little pink suit.<br> But neither<br> Does it gather<br> Any love<br> Here's the best. Here's Vassar.<br> [Applause, Cheering]<br> And then comes Bobby.<br> Oh, I worked for him.<br> - Don't you think we...<br> - I worked here and I worked all over the country.<br> I worked out in California, out in Stockton.<br> Bobby came here and spoke, he went down to Memphis,<br> and then he even went out to Stockton, California...<br> and spoke off the Santa Fe train at the old Santa Fe depot.<br> [Gasps] Oh, he was...<br> a beautiful man.<br> He was not much like,<br> uh, John, you know.<br> He was more puny-like.<br> But all the time I was workin' for him...<br> I was just so scared.<br> Inside, you know? Just scared.<br> Haven, do you think we could get Connie out to the rally?<br> Connie White and Barbara Jean never appear on the same stage together.<br> Connie can replace Barbara Jean, but that's it.<br> As for Haven Hamilton, well,<br> I'll appear wherever Barbara Jean appears.<br> I got a good mind to take you outside.<br> With my wife in the hospital, you puttin' that shit on me?<br> - Calm down, enjoy the show.<br> - [Woman Whispers] Barnett's angry.<br> Okay.<br> [Connie] Walk with me, Joshua<br> - And I will say that I am lame<br> - I think she's, uh...<br> I think she's having an affair here. I really do.<br> The child that we have made<br> - But I'll never let him mention<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Your name<br> - Are you off. You're way off.<br> - [Solo: Fiddle]<br> - [Applause, Cheering]<br> You are way, way off.<br> Are you kidding?<br> [Tom] Some people take<br> And never give<br> - [Mary] I love you.<br> - But all men die<br> And so must live<br> For a while<br> And life is short<br> - [Mary] I love you.<br> - A precious gift<br> This thing we have<br> - Please don't let it drift away<br> - I love you.<br> Honey, won't you let me be your friend<br> [Whispers] I love you.<br> [Whispers] I love you.<br> Honey, won't you let me try again<br> Honey, won't you let me be your friend<br> For another day<br> [Choir: Latin Hymn]<br> When we've been there<br> Ten thousand years<br> Bright, shining<br> As the sun<br> We've no less days<br> To sing God's praise<br> Than when<br> We'd first<br> Begun<br> And on the profession of your faith,<br> I baptize you, my sister,<br> in the name of the Father and of the Son...<br> and of the Holy Ghost.<br> Amen.<br> I'm newborn again<br> Been a long time talkin'<br> 'Bout my trials here below<br> Free grace Free grace<br> Free grace, sinner<br> Free grace Free grace<br> I'm newborn again<br> And He walks with me<br> And He talks with me<br> And he tells me I am His own<br> And the joy we share<br> As we tarry there<br> None other<br> Has ever<br> Known<br> He speaks and the sound of His voice<br> Is so sweet<br> The birds hush their singing<br> And the melody<br> That He gave to me<br> Within my heart<br> Is ringin'<br> You know, my wife Esther is on the same floor with Barbara Jean.<br> - And He walks with me<br> - Oh, and Esther and I had a son...<br> - And He talks with me<br> - in the service too.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Oh, not the army. It was the navy.<br> And He tells me I am His own<br> We lost him in the South Pacific. We don't know how.<br> - And thejoy we share<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - World War II.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> As we tarry there<br> None other<br> Has ever<br> Known<br> - [Church Bells Tolling, Faint]<br> - I'm wandering in a graveyard.<br> The dead here have no crosses,<br> nor tombstones, nor wreaths to sing of their past glory,<br> but lie in rotting, decaying, rusty heaps,<br> their innards ripped out by greedy, vulturous hands.<br> Their vast, vacant skeletons...<br> sadly sighing to the sky.<br> [Bells Continue Tolling]<br> The rust on their bodies...<br> is the color of dried blood.<br> Dried blood.<br> I'm reminded of...<br> of an elephant's secret burial ground.<br> Yes.<br> Cette aire de mystre.

I called you this morning.<br> Oh, yeah. The guy from TV. Come on in.<br> Sure.<br> Just... We're just cleanin' up here.<br> [Chuckles] You know the...<br> - Sunday morning blues.<br> - Would you hold this?<br> - Sure.<br> - Thanks.<br> Let me just move this over here.<br> - Is this your new album?<br> - Yeah. That's our only album.<br> It's a very good one, though. I've heard it. It's terrific.<br> - I'm really sorry about the mess.<br> - Oh, that's all right.<br> You oughta see my room.<br> We had a little party last night. Had a pretty good time too.<br> Uh, I wanted to, um,<br> tell you a couple things about what we're trying to do with this show.<br> - Can I get you a drink?<br> - No, no, I'm fine.<br> I don't wanna take up much of your time.<br> I just wanna tell you a little bit about what we're trying to do.<br> I know you're astute politically,<br> and I'm certainly not here to sell you a bill of goods.<br> - Don't care about politics.<br> - No politics? Okay, great.<br> Well, then, I've got a problem that could work to your advantage.<br> As you know, this redneck music is very popular right now.<br> I've got an awful lot of these local yokels on the bill singing...<br> - Your basic country folk.<br> - Country crapola. Right.<br> [Chuckles] So I think, uh...<br> What I'm going for is a broader appeal.<br> Which is where we fit in.<br> I want to give it more than just this Southern thing.<br> And I think that a really hip group like yours...<br> could walk off with the evening.<br> Yeah. Probably the only rock group on the...<br> - Absolutely.<br> - Sounds good.<br> - Sounds inviting.<br> - Yeah.<br> And you do get a big audience from these country guys.<br> Is this just network, or...<br> No. It's better than network. It's syndicated.<br> They'll be showing it for a year and a half.<br> - Your glasses, sweetheart.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> This is my wife Mary. This is John Triplette.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> - [Clears Throat]<br> - Go ahead.<br> He's, uh, he's the fella from the television show...<br> that they're doing for Hal Phillip Walker.<br> That political thing going on. He's offered us a spot.<br> You're doing some great promotion. All those buttons and...<br> - Oh, yeah, thank you. I'm trying.<br> - Bumper stickers.<br> Anyway, we got a great time spot on this gala,<br> and we're gonna walk away with the show, John says.<br> We can't vote for him. We're registered Democrats.<br> Besides, he's a little crazy, isn't he?<br> Well, they're all a little crazy, Mary.<br> - [Bill] I'll drink to that.<br> - That's the name of the game.<br> But I think the thing that you should consider is your future.<br> It would give you a great shot.<br> But it doesn't make any difference. We're registered Democrats.<br> [Laughs] Well, I'm a registered Democrat.<br> The only reason we're registered Democrats...<br> is because your father's a registered Democrat...<br> and his father's a registered Democrat.<br> Well, Tom's a registered Democrat, and he wouldn't do it.<br> [Tom] It's not my way<br> To take your hand if I'm...<br> - Hi, Tom.<br> - Hi, Norman. How you doin'?<br> Good. I'm sure glad you called. Is there anything I can...<br> - Sit down.<br> - Okay.<br> Whew. [Chuckles]<br> - You have any speckled birds?<br> - What?<br> You know, L.A. Turnarounds. Uppers.<br> Uh, no, no, I, uh...<br> But I know where to get some grass.<br> - No, thanks. I don't need any grass.<br> - Okay.<br> - Uh, can I ask you a question?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Is there something... Are you angry at Bill?<br> - No.<br> - Oh.<br> 'Cause I, I, uh... You know, I, uh...<br> Bill and Mary and you and, uh...<br> Well, Bill, uh... I mean, Bill seems to be, um...<br> Uh... [Sighs]<br> - I'm just confused.<br> - Mmm.<br> - Uh...<br> - Here.<br> - Why don't you write yourself a hit.<br> - Okay.<br> [Dialing]<br> - [Woman] Hello.<br> - Can I talk to Cherry, please?<br> She's in bed with R.Y. You wanna talk to R.Y.?<br> - I'd rather talk to her, if I could.<br> - Who is this?<br> This is Frank, one of the cooks at the restaurant.<br> Are you a Jehovah's Witness?<br> [Walker On P.A.] Does it make sense that the churches...<br> should remain untaxed on their vast holdings of land...<br> and corporate investments?<br> Does it make sense that a multimillion-dollar income...<br> should go untaxed year after year?<br> No, all will not be easy,<br> but we will bask in the satisfaction...<br> of having done what we should have done.<br> And if we don't get it done today,<br> we may run out of tomorrows.<br> The buses!<br> The buses are empty...<br> and look almost menacing, threatening,<br> as so many yellow dragons watching me...<br> with their hollow, vacant eyes.<br> I wonder how many little black and white children...<br> have yellow nightmares,<br> their own special brand of fear for the yellow peril...<br> [Mutters] I can't have... I can't start...<br> Damn it, it's got to be more...<br> positive.<br> No, more negative. Start again.<br> Yellow is the color of caution.<br> No.<br> Yellow is the color of cowardice.<br> Yellow is the color of sunshine.<br> And yet I see very little sunshine...<br> in the lives of all the little black and white children.<br> I see their lives, rather, as a study in grayness,<br> a mixture of black and...<br> Oh, Christ, no. That's fascist.<br> Yellow! Yellow, yellow, yellow. Yellow fever.<br> We'll be able to talk about it. They're checkin' out now.<br> - Get with him before he leaves.<br> - What about the place?<br> - It's not bad at all.<br> - Think it'll work out?<br> It's got this bizarre stage that drops out of the ceiling.<br> - [Excited Chatter]<br> - They're gettin' out this mornin'.<br> - The place is very confused.<br> - Bye-bye!<br> - Is the place out there okay?<br> - [Barnett] Bye-bye, bye-bye.<br> Wait a minute. Here we go.<br> Uh, Barnett! Phone's for you.<br> - Is it important, or what?<br> - Bye, girls.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Barnett. John Triplette.<br> - Who?<br> - Hello!

How is Mrs. Green?<br> She's fine, and she's gonna be thrilled to hear I saw you again.<br> Give her my very best. And is she takin' her vitamin E?<br> - Got 'em right here.<br> - All right. Good for you.<br> You take care, darlin'. Bye-bye.<br> All right, come on. Let's get her on there.<br> - Lucky for you. Whoo!<br> - As long as I'm done<br> - Gonna buy me a pistol<br> - All right, get in.<br> We gotta go with those white horseshoes, huh?<br> We're gonna live with those for infamy.<br> [Barbara Jean Continues Singing]<br> Take that cortege on the other elevator.<br> - Didn't the doctor get ahold of you?<br> - No more calls, Delbert.<br> I'm really sorry I have to tell you this.<br> Mrs. Green expired this morning.<br> What?<br> Mrs. Green died this morning.<br> Wait right here. Let me go get the doctor.<br> [Clears Throat] Mr. Green?<br> Mr. Green, you know, my mama saved her life.<br> They used to live next door to each other. My mama put out the flames.<br> She always loved Barbara Jean more than anything.<br> She's still keepin' a scrapbook on her.<br> The only thing she said to me when I joined up was,<br> "When you're doin' your travels, I want you to see Barbara Jean.<br> Don't say nothin' about me. Just see Barbara Jean."<br> So that's what I been doin'.<br> Now I'm gonna go over to Opryland and hear her sing.<br> - [Trembling Sigh]<br> - Give my best to your wife, now.<br> [Sobbing]<br> - [Laughs]<br> - Wait a minute. Don't laugh.<br> Let me just... I have a theory about political assassination.<br> You see, I believe people like Madame Pearl...<br> and all these people here in this country who carry guns...<br> are the real assassins.<br> Because, you see, they stimulate other people...<br> who are perhaps innocent...<br> and who eventually are the ones who pull the trigger.<br> - Ma?<br> - Kenny? Where are you, Kenny?<br> - I'm in Nashville. How are you?<br> - I was so worried.<br> - There's no reason to worry.<br> - Well, I haven't been able to sleep.<br> I had to take some of that Ny Quil so I could go to sleep.<br> - Puts you right out.<br> - Did it help?<br> Yes, it did. Where are you staying in Nashville?<br> - I'm staying at a rooming house.<br> - Who you talkin' to?<br> - It's my mother.<br> - Who are you talking to, Kenny?<br> A girl that lives in the rooming house.<br> Who owns that rooming house?<br> - Her uncle.<br> - A man owns the rooming house?<br> Well, it can't be very clean.<br> - Don't be silly.<br> - I bet the sheets aren't clean.<br> In the South you can pick up this parasite...<br> - Joan, put that down, please!<br> - Kenny, listen...<br> - Just a minute.<br> - I wanted to look at your fiddle.<br> Kenny! You can get this parasite fungus in the South.<br> It's very difficult to get rid of. When are you coming home?<br> I don't know. A couple of weeks.<br> You left your blue suit hanging in the closet.<br> I don't need my suit.<br> I would really like you to get home as soon as you can.<br> Mother, just listen to me.<br> Kenny, don't you talk to me in that tone of voice.<br> I love you too, Mama.<br> I really do. I'll see you soon.<br> Bye-bye.<br> [Up-tempo Country]<br> [Solo]<br> [Applause]<br> Let's find Barnett, hope he's not in a bad mood.<br> Hi. How are you?<br> - [Del] Hey, Barnett!<br> - I'm obliged to give them...<br> - Hey, Barnett.<br> - What do you want now?<br> This guy wants me to do four shows. What do you want?<br> Don't let her do too much. How you hangin'?<br> - You feelin' better now?<br> - Yeah, I feel swell.<br> We gotta talk to you. We're gonna do a show.<br> Okay, now, John's doing this show.<br> Haven's gonna do it. We want Barbara Jean to headline it.<br> - Unbelievable.<br> - Now wait a second, man.<br> I wish they wouldn't rush us. Get a shot.<br> It's national TVfor this candidate Hal Phillip Walker.<br> We don't want her to make any political statement.<br> What do you think her bein' there's gonna be?<br> - Ain't that a political statement?<br> - People haven't seen her.<br> No, fellas. Don't take it personal.<br> No politics, no government, no nothin'.<br> - All right? Okay?<br> - All right.<br> - I heard you all out.<br> - Hello, boys. How's it goin'?<br> I believe I met you before in the hospital.<br> Look at that. Didn't Jewel show you how to do her hair?<br> - Come on, darlin'.<br> - How do you do, honey?<br> - No pictures.<br> - I'm all excited.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - I feel great.<br> I told the band you'd start off with the cowboy song.<br> - Forget it.<br> - No, John, just leave it to me.<br> He can take a flying leap.<br> I'm gonna stay after him like a rodent, man.<br> [Audience Applauding, Cheering, Whistling]<br> He's got a tape deck in his tractor<br> And he listens to the local news<br> He finds out where the bass are bitin'<br> While he's plowin' to the country blues<br> He was a cowboy and he knew I loved him well<br> A cowboy's secrets you never tell<br> No, there's nothin' like the lovin'<br> Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man<br> He's got a tape deck in his tractor<br> While he's plowing up his daddy's land<br> He's got more horse sense<br> Than I ever seen in any man<br> He was a cowboy and he knew I loved him well<br> A cowboy's secrets you never tell<br> No, there's nothin' like the lovin'<br> Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man<br> On Saturday nights we go dancin' in town<br> And all the boys'll order up another round<br> In the summertime<br> We look forward to the rodeo<br> On Saturday nights we go to town<br> And all the boys'll order up another round<br> When he rides saddle bronc<br> I wait to hear that whistle blow<br> He's got a tape deck in his tractor<br> I can hear him when he's comin' home<br> Then he holds me in the rocking chair<br> And sings me the love song<br> He was a cowboy and he knew I loved him well<br> A cowboy's secrets you never tell<br> No, there's nothin' like the lovin'<br> Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man<br> No, there's nothin' like the muscles<br> Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man<br> Thank you.

"Because it had those chipmunks in it."<br> And I thought that was so cute,<br> because, well, I can sing like a munchkin myself.<br> I'm real fond of The Wizard of Oz.<br> Plus, I live out, you know, just a ways off of Interstate 24...<br> on the road to Chattanooga.<br> So you can see why I kinda related to that.<br> I think me and the boys are gonna strike up another tune for you now.<br> Let's go, boys.<br> [Resumes Intro]<br> I think there's a storm...<br> seems like it's a-brewin'.<br> That's what my grandaddy used to say before he lost his hearin'.<br> - [Stops]<br> - Once he got deaf,<br> he never talked much no more.<br> 'Cept sometimes he'd say "Oh, gosh" or "Durn it" or "My word!"<br> My granny'd go around clickin' her teeth to the radio all day.<br> Boy, was she a lot of fun, and cooked my favorite, roast beef.<br> She was a sweetheart.<br> She raised chickens too. She, um...<br> Did you ever hear a chicken sound? You know how chickens go?<br> [Clucking]<br> Here, chick, chick, chick. Here, chick, chick, chick.<br> Anyway, I guess we'd better strike up this tune before it's too late.<br> Okay, boys.<br> [Resumes Intro]<br> [Vamping Intro]<br> - The first job I ever really got...<br> - [Stops]<br> Grandma... She's the one who clacked her false teeth to the radio.<br> She taught my mama how to sing, and my mama taught me.<br> One time she took me, 'cause we was gonna get a new Frigidaire.<br> She took me to the Frigidaire store where the man was advertisin'.<br> This record was goin' 'round, and Mama told him I knew how to sing.<br> He said, "If she learns this tune, I'll give y'all a quarter."<br> So Mama and I went home...<br> And then what happened? Let's see, I think... Uh, yeah.<br> We went home and I learned both sides of the record in half an hour.<br> We went back and told him that I'd learned 'em, and he said,<br> "Let me hear," so I sang both sides of the record instead of just one.<br> So he gave us 50 cents, and we went across the street and had us a soda.<br> [Chuckles] Ever since then I been workin'. I don't...<br> I think ever since then I been workin' and doin' my...<br> - Come on, come on.<br> - Supportin'myself.<br> - Anyway...<br> - [Chuckling] Hey, hey. Hey, hey.<br> - Am I all right?

You know that.<br> - Bye, Wade.<br> Dumb bitch. I don't know why I stick around.<br> She just makes me so goddamn mad I could spit.<br> [Man] Little more than a year ago,<br> a man named Hal Phillip Walker...<br> excited a group of college students with some questions:<br> Have you stood on a high and windy hill...<br> and heard the acorns drop and roll?<br> Have you walked in the valley beside the brook,<br> walked alone and remembered?<br> Does Christmas smell like oranges to you?<br> In a commencement speech such questions were fitting, perhaps,<br> but hardly the material with which to launch a presidential campaign.<br> Even those who pay close attention to politics...<br> probably saw Hal Phillip Walker and his Replacement Party...<br> as a bit of frost on the hillside...<br> summer, if not late spring, would surely do away with all that.<br> Well, now that summer,<br> along with presidential primaries, is heavy upon us...<br> and the frost is still there,<br> perhaps we should take a closer look.<br> Hal Phillip Walker is, in a way, a mystery man.<br> Out of nowhere, with a handful of students and scarcely any pros,<br> he's managed to win three presidential primaries...<br> and is given a fighting chance to take a fourth... Tennessee.<br> A win in that state would take on added significance,<br> for only once in the last 50 years has Tennessee failed to vote...<br> for the winning presidential candidate.<br> No doubt many Americans, especially party liners,<br> wish that Hal Phillip Walker would go away,<br> disappear like the natural frost...<br> and come again at some more convenient season.<br> But wherever he may be going,<br> it seems sure Hal Phillip Walker is not going away,<br> for there is genuine appeal...<br> and it must be related to the raw courage of this man...<br> running for president, willing to battle vast oil companies,<br> eliminate subsidies to farmers,<br> tax churches, abolish the electoral college,<br> change the national anthem...<br> and remove lawyers from government, especially from Congress.<br> At this point it'd be wise to say most of us don't know the answer...<br> to Hal Phillip Walker,<br> but to answer one of his questions,<br> as a matter of fact, Christmas has always smelled like oranges to me.<br> [Male Singer] Our country cries<br> For peace today<br> There's trouble in<br> The U.S.A.<br> Watergate<br> Is the sound that rings<br> Wonder what<br> This year will bring<br> - You're going the wrong way!<br> - Wonder what<br> - [Horn Honks]<br> - This year will bring<br> - All y'all goin' the wrong way!<br> - Will there be sadness<br> Tears or pain<br> Or will the sun<br> Refuse to shine<br> Wonder what<br> This year will bring<br> Down in Nashville<br> I heard today<br> A shortage of food<br> Is on its way<br> While up in Denver<br> Gas shortage rings<br> Lord, I wonder what<br> - This year will bring<br> - You may have to sit out here.<br> - [Continues]<br> - [Walker] That's all right, John.<br> - Give me time to work on my speech.<br> - Okay, thank you.<br> - Hi. How are you?<br> - Hi, good to see you.<br> - How are you?<br> - Good to see you.<br> Or will the sun<br> - [Sighs]<br> - Refuse to shine<br> - Delbert, how's it going?<br> - Hi, John. How are you?<br> - Can I say hello?<br> - He's working on his speech.<br> - We'll do that later.<br> - Right.<br> - He's gonna wait there?<br> - He'll sit out there for a minute.<br> - Anybody here yet?<br> - Yeah, some of the people.<br> - Barnett?<br> - He oughta be here quick.<br> This building was originally here...<br> It was made out of lumber and plaster of Paris.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - This whole big building...<br> See, they built it for a centennial celebration,<br> and people liked this, they didn't want it torn down.<br> Nashville got to be called the Athens of the South.<br> - They sorta took to that.<br> - Because of this building?<br> - Yeah, right.<br> - Oh, that's good.<br> Then they had to rebuild it. This was built right before I was born.<br> Whoo! Gonna be a scorcher.<br> [Del] The park police control all this.<br> What's all these chairs? We don't need all these chairs.<br> - This ain't no band here, right?<br> - What's the matter, man?<br> I don't... I don't believe it!<br> What's the matter?<br> Are you guys jerkin' me around? Do you see what I see, or am I...<br> What the hell is that sign doin' up there, Triple?<br> Come on. We had some ground rules.<br> No political signs, no advertisements, no noth...<br> What the hell are you doin', huh? Go about your business.<br> I have abided by all the ground rules you laid down, Barnett.<br> I have Walker sitting out behind this place like an idiot!<br> Well, he can sit out in the sun and parch for all I care!<br> My wife ain't well! I brought her out of a hospital bed to be here!<br> You gave me some truth! You're full of it, just like your man!<br> - I have abided by every ground rule.<br> - Except what?<br> She ain't gonna appear here with that sign up there!<br> - I have busted my ass for you!<br> - I'm gonna bust your ass too!<br> I am through with it! Take your wife and take a walk!<br> I'll tell these people she's not going to appear again!<br> - Well, go on and do it!<br> - Okay, take a walk, and I'll do it.<br> You'd do that, huh? You'd put a knife in my wife's back like that?<br> You're putting the knife in her back, buster. You're doing it.<br> I have not got time to take the sign down and put it back up again!<br> What are you hollerin' about? You tryin' to embarrass me?<br> I'm tryin' to be heard.<br> Well, get these chairs off and we'll talk about it.<br> - I'll take care of it.<br> - Delbert... Where is that rat?<br> What are you hiding for, you little rat?<br> And grant us so to serve thee by day...<br> that we may find eternal fellowship with them...<br> through Him who died and rose again for us all,<br> Jesus Christ, our Lord.<br> Amen.<br> Mr. Green, it's not over.<br> - I'm going to find Martha.<br> - What for?<br> She owes some respect to Esther.<br> [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Barbara Jean and Haven Hamilton.<br> [Applause, Cheering]<br> [Haven] When I feel my life perishing<br> I call you on the phone<br> [Barbara Jean] I always fix you up<br> When you get broken<br> 'Cause every time that I got hurt<br> And went out of control<br> I knew the fears you felt<br> Before you spoke them<br> You tell me<br> [Together] One, I love you<br> Two I'm thinkin' of you<br> Three I'll never let you go<br> And four, I miss you<br> Five, I wanna kiss you<br> Six I won't leave you no more<br> [Barbara Jean] When I feel my life vanishin'<br> Like waves upon the sand<br> [Haven] With nothin'to replace it<br> But invention<br> [Barbara Jean] So I make my rhymes and I sing my songs<br> Still they don't understand<br> - [Continues]<br> - You can't find her here.<br> I'll find her.<br> - I'd sing ya<br> - [Together] One, I love you<br> Two I'm thinkin'of you<br> Three I'll never let you go<br> And four, I miss you<br> Five, I wanna kiss you<br> Six, I won't leave you no more<br> One, I love you<br> Two I'm thinkin'of you<br> Three I'll never let you go<br> And four, I miss you<br> Five, I wanna kiss you<br> Six I won't leave you no more<br> Six I won't leave you<br> No more<br> Six I won't leave you<br> No mo-o-ore<br> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Mama and Daddy<br> Raised me with lovin' care<br> They sacrificed<br> So I could have a better share<br> They fed me and nursed me<br> And sent me to school<br> Mama taught me how to sing<br> Daddy lived the Golden Rule<br> When I think of the children alone and afraid<br> Abandoned and wild like a fatherless child<br> I think of my mama<br> And how she could sing<br> Harmony with my daddy<br> Our laughter would ring<br> Down the highways<br> On the beaches<br> Just as far as memory reaches<br> I still hear Daddy singin'his old army songs<br> We'd laugh and count horses<br> As we drove along<br> We were young then We were together<br> We could bear floods and fire<br> And bad weather<br> And now that I'm older<br> Grown up, on my own<br> I still love Mama and Daddy best<br> And my Idaho home<br> Mama grew up<br> On the prairies of Kansas<br> She was tender and sweet<br> The dust and tornadoes blew 'round her<br> But they left her straight up on her feet<br> My daddy grew up on his own more or less<br> His mama died when he was just 11<br> He had seven sisters to raise him<br> But he dreamed of his mama in heaven<br> His daddy drank whiskey and had a sharp eye<br> He sold chicken medicine farmers would buy<br> Together they hunted the fields and the farms<br> When his daddy died my daddy rest in my mama's arms<br> Down the highways<br> On the beaches<br> Just as far as memory reaches<br> I still hear Daddy singin' his old army songs<br> We'd laugh and count horses<br> As we drove along<br> We were young then<br> We were together<br> We could bear floods and fire<br> And bad weather<br> And now that I'm older<br> Grown up, on my own<br> I still love Mama and Daddy best<br> And my Idaho home<br> And now that I'm older<br> Grown up, on my own<br> I still love my Mama and Daddy best<br> And my Idaho home<br> For Mama and Daddy.<br> - [Applause, Cheering]<br> - Thank you.<br> [Applause, Cheering Continue]<br> Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Wonderful!
