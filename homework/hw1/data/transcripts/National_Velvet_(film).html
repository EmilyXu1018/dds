England's a free country.<br> Free, is it?<br> You better detour around Sewels.<br> That's a piece of free advice.<br> Our constable don't like odd characters.<br> But he's a friend.<br> And he knows all about horses and--<br> And he's coming home for supper.<br> Velvet, your father won't like it.<br> l have business in Sewels.<br> No doubt.<br> Mrs. Herbert Brown.<br> That's very interesting.<br> Your father's address book?<br> Yes, ma'am. l found it in his<br> belongings. His name was Dan Taylor.<br> Did you wash your neck?<br> Yes, Mother.<br> lt's soaking.<br> Next time unbutton your collar.<br> Mr. Taylor...<br> ...do you like Poon's<br> mixture for canaries?<br> He doesn't know anything about canaries.<br> How do you know?<br> You know anything about canaries?<br> No, sir.<br> That's settled.<br> l was sick all night.<br> l was sick all night!<br> Go on.<br> l am getting on.<br> You're just rolling it<br> 'round and 'round.<br> Now swallow.<br> Can't. lsn't slidey.<br> lsn't he lovely?<br> He collects insects.<br> Must he wear that bottle to the table?<br> Young man...<br> ...there's a strict rule<br> about feeding Jacob at table.<br> l'm sorry.<br> Makes a beggar out of him.<br> -Where's Edwina?<br> -Meeting that boy.<br> Don't tease her when she comes in.<br> So sorry to be late.<br> 'Dwina's late!<br> 'Dwina, this is Mi Taylor.<br> l found him on the Brighton Road.<br> Don't look so shocked.<br> He was coming to see Mother anyway.<br> Uncanny, isn't it?<br> 'Dwina's late and l was sick all night.<br> That's a lie. You weren't sick.<br> l could have been sick if l wanted to.<br> You told a story, didn't you?<br> Yes, it was a story.<br> You know what a story is.<br> What is it?<br> Say you're sorry.<br> Well?<br> He's thinking.<br> Make up your mind.<br> Yes, l'm sorry.<br> Go on. Sorry for what?<br> For being sick all night.<br> The child will make a lawyer.<br> Put that back.<br> lt aches me when l eat.<br> lt's a devil plate.<br> Ache or no, that cost<br> four pounds ten. lt's solid gold.<br> How many times must l tell you girls<br> have only your faces for your fortunes?<br> Do you want to have<br> a face like a rabbit?<br> She'd rather have a face like a horse.<br> Enough, Mally.<br> You've things to say about your father.<br> You said that you knew him.<br> l didn't say anything.<br> You said you had things to talk of.<br> You must have known him.<br> Why'd he have your name<br> in his address book?<br> l thought you knew the answer.<br> To tell you the strict truth,<br> ma'am, l can't.<br> l found the book among<br> my father's belongings after he died.<br> And l thought since l was passing<br> through Sewels...<br> ...you being an old friend<br> of his that...<br> ...maybe you could....<br> No, thank you.<br> l'd better be running along<br> before it gets too dark.<br> Dark?<br> Forgot to cover the canaries!<br> You forgot something else too.<br> Amen.<br> Mally and her birds!<br> Must you go?<br> Yes, l'm afraid l must.<br> Where will you go?<br> Stay on the road,<br> find another town.<br> Father...<br> ...how are you feeling?<br> You don't look well at all.<br> l never felt fitter in my life.<br> But you don't really look well, Father.<br> Do you need a helper in the shop,<br> just for summer?<br> More sheep come to market<br> in summer than winter.<br> May be something in what you say.<br> lt's true more sheep come to market<br> in summer than in winter.<br> But, however it may grieve you...<br> ...l feel fine.<br> No reason why you should go on<br> in the dark, Mr. Brown.<br> There's the bed in the stable<br> he could have tonight.<br> You'll find a blanket too.<br> lt's castle pudding, Mi.<br> Father!<br> Good night, Ted.<br> Night, 'Dwina.<br> Good night.<br> Boys.<br> She's the age for it.<br> Don't say anything to her.<br> l don't fancy you working<br> at night, Mrs. Brown.<br> Let it go till morning.<br> You look tired.<br> l'm well enough.<br> lt's you who must conserve yourself.<br> After all, there is more sheep<br> coming to market summer then winter.<br> There's small sense in hiring that boy.<br> Hiring? Never crossed my mind.<br> But you could do worse.<br> clothe himself and save a little.<br> Because he's the son of Dan Taylor?<br> Did l ever ask a favor<br> because l'm the son of my father?<br> He won't get special favor.<br> l'll see that he earns his 10 bob.<br> Never fear.<br> See the girls get to bed, would you?<br> l am a little tired.<br> All right.<br> You're an odd one, Velvet.<br> This is my driving night.<br> l'm only allowed on Fridays.<br> l've got two minutes more driving.<br> Come on, Pie. Gallop!<br> What's that covering, Mally?<br> 'Dwina's knickers<br> that she had for the party.<br> They don't look like knickers.<br> l always thought Jacob<br> had a little bird dog in him.<br> He'd better not, Father.<br> Down, Jacob!<br> lt's wonderful how Edwina can<br> sleep through all this bedlam.<br> Easy now, Pie.<br> Oh, you're a sweet one, Pie.<br> What is this Pie business?<br> A new one?<br> Father, he's the loveliest thing.<br> You should see him.<br> He never puts a foot wrong.<br> Who?<br> Mr. Ede's new horse.<br> l'm in love with him.<br> You're a fickle woman.<br> You say that about other horses.<br> But this is the real thing, Father.<br> Now calm yourself.<br> You'll be losing your supper next.<br> But this is very different, Father.<br> ltjust skips a beat here.<br> Like 'Dwina!<br> -'Dwina skips a beat?<br> -For boys.<br> Oh, for boys.<br> Come, Jacob,<br> l must take you for a walk.<br> Sleep, girls. Mother won't be in.<br> Why not?<br> She's just tired.<br> Edwina, you'd better<br> take your clothes off.<br> Skips a beat, does it?<br> That's the last time l take you<br> into my confidence, Velvet Brown!<br> May l come in, Mother?<br> Yes.<br> Are you angry, Mother?<br> l had to come.<br> Of course l'm not angry.<br> What's disturbing you, Velvet?<br> You're all lighted up.<br> Did you know Mi Taylor's father?<br> Perhaps when you were a swimmer?<br> When your pictures were<br> in the paper and all that?<br> Way back, l mean.<br> Way back.<br> Know how l came to swim the Channel<br> and have my pictures in the paper?<br> Mi Taylor's father showed me how.<br> Mi Taylor's father?<br> He was my trainer.<br> lt was he told me what to do.<br> Worked with me for months.<br> Followed me in a boat.<br> Leaned over and fed me.<br> Breathed the spirit into me.<br> Made me do it when l was<br> ready to give up.<br> Why didn't you tell Mi<br> about his father?<br> lt wasn't the time for it.<br> There's a right time for everything.<br> But he'd be so happy.<br> lt'd give him something to go on.<br> He needn't go. He can stay.<br> Ten bob a week and his keep.<br> lt's not charity.<br> He'll work his way.<br> l know he will.<br> May l go and tell him?<br> Only tell him he can stay.<br> He'll not trade on his father's name.<br> lf the stuff is there, it'll show.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> You still up?<br> Yes, l'm still up. Come in.<br> l know something.<br> You do?<br> You can stay. Notjust for tonight.<br> Mother did it. Ten bob a week,<br> food and keep to help Father.<br> lsn't it wonderful, Mi?<br> The room may look a little shabby...<br> ...but you'll find it very comfortable.<br> The floor does that in places.<br> But the bed's good.<br> This yours?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> You can fix it up bit by bit,<br> in your spare time.<br> You can paint it, perhaps.<br> And you can raise this<br> and get a nice breeze.<br> And in the winter you can<br> put it down again.<br> -You can get a stove.<br> -l didn't say l'd stay.<br> l'm considering.<br> Considering? Don't you know<br> if you'd be happy?<br> lt isn't the happiness l'm considering.<br> lt's where it'll get me.<br> lt's for the lack of considering<br> that people stay poor.<br> Have you ever been quiet<br> for a few hours, and just think?<br> All the time.<br> All the time, about horses.<br> All day and every night.<br> l want to be a famous rider.<br> l should like to hunt...<br> ...ride to hounds.<br> l should like to race.<br> l'd like to have so many horses,<br> that l could walk between the boxes...<br> ...and ride what l choose.<br> Do you feel all right?<br> That's Miss Ada.<br> Who?<br> Miss Ada. She pulls the cart.<br> Meet her yet?<br> She is a little old and tired.<br> We love her.<br> Don't you love horses?<br> l hate 'em.<br> l don't believe it.<br> You know too much about them.<br> You hate a thing when you know<br> too much about it.<br> Perhaps you're just scared by horses.<br> You will stay, won't you?<br> Yes, l'll stay.<br> Perhaps it's smarter.<br> l'm sure it is.<br> Better get to bed.<br> Father leaves early.<br> -She wants another carrot.<br> -One is her usual.<br> lf we don't give her another,<br> she might whinny all night.<br> l'll get it myself.<br> See, Miss Ada?<br> He's ashamed to admit he likes you.<br> -Here you are.<br> -No, you give it to her yourself.<br> Why be ashamed of your feelings?<br> lf you like Miss Ada,<br> why pretend you don't?<br> Because l told you l hated horses.<br> You'll have to get over that, Mi.<br> Why?<br> Because l love them so.<br> Every day l pray to God<br> to give me horses...<br> ...wonderful horses.<br> To let me be the best rider in England.<br> -Hello, Velvet.<br> -Good morning, Miss Melbert.<br> -l brought Miss Ada, Mother.<br> -Good.<br> Miss Ada here?<br> Boy!

That's a teaser!<br> Got to teach him not to run out.<br> He's got to start turning while in air.<br> lf he learns the Canal Jump<br> we'll have taught him plenty.<br> lt's over here.<br> l'll show you.<br> There's a guardrail, a 6 foot ditch<br> and a 5 foot hedge.<br> The real danger is at the turn.<br> That's where they pile up and go wild.<br> That's where things happen.<br> We'll start him<br> on the hedge by Tupper's.<br> Steady now!<br> Careful!<br> No, no!<br> Don't start him straight off!<br> You'll run him into the canal!<br> Turn him, l told you!<br> That's good!<br> He's well away! That's the canal turn!<br> Good boy! That's the fastest time yet.<br> Look at that!<br> Paper horses just before<br> the Grand National.<br> l've been neglecting them.<br> Somebody's been changing<br> these all around.<br> Who's been at my box?<br> Me.<br> l.<br> You too?<br> Good evening, Ede.<br> l expected to see<br> more excitement tonight.<br> There's nothing to be excited about.<br> -When do you leave?<br> -5 in the morning.<br> Before breakfast.<br> Got any tips on the Grand National?<br> The Pie.<br> ln that case l'll put a pound on him.<br> That's a pound wasted.<br> We can't let down the home colors.<br> Pound to win.<br> Thank you, l'll put it in<br> with the other bets.<br> -Other bets?<br> -You're the ninth one here.<br> Mr. Jenkins bet three pounds.<br> Didn't know Mr. Jenkins<br> had three pounds.<br> -Good luck, Velvet.<br> -Thank you.<br> Good night, all.<br> A fool and his money are easily parted.<br> lt's bad enough to see<br> this family waste money...<br> ...on hired horse vans<br> and fancy jockey silks...<br> ...but when l see<br> the village of Sewels...<br> ...throw good money after bad...<br> ...it's enough to make me<br> lose my faith in humanity!<br> l'm glad to hear you have<br> got faith in humanity.<br> As for me, l'd sometimes<br> sooner put my faith in a horse.<br> Tell me that one.<br> Bedtime, Donald.<br> l'm busy. We're all busy.<br> Tell me a horse.<br> One more.<br> This was a horse called Moifaa.<br> Came from...<br> ...New Zealand, on a big ship.<br> They sent him around the world...<br> ...and finally one day<br> the ship went down.<br> And the horse swam off to an island.<br> There was nothing to eat there...<br> ...so the horse run up and down<br> the seashore, gazing out at the sea.<br> And then what?<br> He whimpered and neighed for help.<br> The horse did?<br> There was nothing to eat<br> on the island but...<br> ...salt grass, and salt water<br> And him used to a good stable!<br> Did he die?<br> No.<br> Yes, he did, l know he did.<br> Some fishermen saw him<br> and fetched him.<br> He won the Grand National that year.<br> He died! He died<br> on that island! l know!<br> -How do you know?<br> -l was there!<br> You weren't! You weren't born.<br> l was born!<br> -That's a story.<br> -You weren't born. You were a star.<br> l wasn't a star. l was born,<br> and l was there and that horse died!<br> He died on that salty place.<br> And he lied down,<br> and his eyes was dead...<br> ...and he died! l know he did.<br> He died! He died!<br> On that island!<br> Hysterics. Past his bedtime!<br> You too, Velvet.<br> -Bedtime.<br> -Bedtime now?<br> But l just ate my supper.<br> Go to bed, Velvet.<br> -Good night, Father.<br> -Good night, Velvet.<br> We're almost ready.<br> Goodbye, 'Dwina.<br> Forgive for what l said about The Pie?<br> Of course. You didn't mean it.<br> -Goodbye, Velvet.<br> -Goodbye, Mally.<br> -Remember the Finch's canary catalogue.<br> -Goodbye, Donald.<br> Bring me back a monkey!<br> You'll be proud of The Pie, Mother.<br> l want to be proud of you.<br> All right, push!<br> Heave!<br> You'll understand<br> l'm not a frivolous man...<br> ...but l'd like to risk<br> a couple of pounds.<br> Put it on The Pie for me.<br> Yes, sir.<br> l'll not be angry if you say<br> nothing to the missus about it.<br> Good luck, my boy.<br> Father, do you mind about all this?<br> l'm not angry, Velvet.<br> Run along with you!<br> Go on!<br> Let me see it again, the letter.<br> Why not settle back and try to sleep?<br> We got a long trip ahead of us.<br> Please!<br> ''lvan Taski.''<br> l wonder what he'll be like.<br> lt's important.<br> You think he'll like The Pie?<br> He'll like him. Ajockey knows<br> a good horse when he sees one.<br> How do we know<br> these clothes will fit him?<br> All jockeys are the same size,<br> same brain, same vision...<br> ...seeing the world from a horse.<br> Just this once! l've got the rest<br> of my life to wear them.<br> Horses!<br> Count Carlo, a good horse!<br> ''The Great Count Carlo'' they call him.<br> He jump like no jumper l ever see.<br> And where is he? Dead.<br> What's he talking about?<br> A horse he was going to ride died.<br> That's bad luck, Mr. Taski.<br> You've got a fine mount now.<br> The Pie's great.<br> This every owner believes,<br> he has best horse.<br> Such a little girl.<br> Her money's as good as anybody's.<br> l have not seen it yet.<br> There's your money in advance.<br> My papers.<br> We'll take them around tomorrow.<br> So, business is finished.<br> Tomorrow l ride your horse,<br> at night, l take train to Seaport.<br> You're a man for speed.<br> Don't you like England?<br> l must like England too?<br> Your food? Your climate?<br> lt kill Count Carlo.<br> lt can kill me too.<br> Little Taski goes home tomorrow night.<br> When Miss Brown<br> leads you in as the winner...<br> ...you'll stay for the fun.<br> Such a little girl.<br> Only in England can it happen...<br> ...that a child brings<br> a plow horse from the field.<br> l know you feel bad now,<br> about having lost your mount.<br> That was bad luck.<br> But wait till you see The Pie.<br> Eat, then we'll go--<br> Tonight? You're serious?<br> Why not? See him, say hello,<br> get the feel of him!<br> Shake his hand, give him<br> a visiting card, make a bow!<br> Mr. Taski's right, it would be<br> foolish...<br> ...to go out there tonight.<br> And just as foolish for you<br> to ride him tomorrow, Mr. Taski.<br> You may be a fine rider, but The Pie<br> would know your heart's not in it.<br> He'd know you don't believe.<br> He'd say...<br> ...''Why bring me a rider who<br> doesn't believe we can win?''<br> What you call crazy, eh?<br> No, what you call the truth, Mr. Taski.<br> Looked everywhere.<br> Tried everything, asked everybody.<br> No jockey.<br> Looks like there'll be<br> no race for The Pie.<br> The waste! The sickening waste<br> of it on a scatterbrain dream.<br> Snow, slush, mud...<br> ...mornings, nights, Sundays.<br> The sore back, the rawness<br> of your hands and face in the wind.<br> Searching for weeks for a rider...<br> ...then you say,<br> ''No, Mr. Taski, goodbye.''<br> But that man Taski<br> lost the race tonight.<br> You know that.<br> He didn't believe. What good's<br> ajockey who's only riding for the fee?<br> He's a rider. Things happen in a race.<br> Not with The Pie, he would know.<br> He'll know when l take him home...<br> ...before he's had a chance<br> to run the course.<br> Why don't you ride him?<br> Want to know why?<br> l'll tell you why, if you want to know.<br> lt's been going around<br> in my mind all night.<br> Yes, l'll tell you!<br> l was ajockey...<br> ...and l rode at Manchester<br> one fine day.<br> Three of us were going<br> for the final jump...<br> ...and l saw a chance to win the race.<br> lt was me that did it.<br> Then there was a tangle...<br> ...a tangle of reins...<br> ...and jockeys.<br> One got killed.<br> That's why l don't ride anymore.<br> l'm afraid!<br> l'm all soft inside, so l don't ride!<br> l'm no good to you when you need me!<br> You kept me going, breathed the spirit<br> into me. There's greatness in you!<br> There's nothing in me!<br> Come on, Pie, we're going home.<br> Tough luck, old boy.<br> You'll never have a chance<br> to walk in that paddock.<br> And it's all my fault.<br> Because if l wasn't a coward,<br> l'd ride you myself.<br> But you wouldn't know me if l rode you.<br> You'd say. ''That isn't Mi Taylor.''<br> Because l'm always down here<br> on the ground...<br> ...never up there on your back.<br> lt is Mi Taylor!<br> l dare you to throw me!<br> You'd better take a good look at it.<br> Tomorrow you'll not have the chance.<br> Because we'll fly around that course<br> like the devil was at our heels!<br> Up there somewhere, watching,<br> will be the King and Queen.<br> What in the name of<br> all that's crazy are you doing?<br> Look. lsn't it perfect?<br> Perfect for what?<br> lt's a wonderful idea!<br> You'll have to cut my hair<br> but the clothes are just right.<br> And the description<br> on the clearance paper fits.<br> The Grand National<br> is no game for a little girl.<br> They won't know l'm a girl.<br> Cut my hair and l'll be exactly right.<br> And you'll get your neck exactly broken.<br> The Pie will take care of me.<br> Don't be angry. You know<br> The Pie would burst his heart for me.<br> l'll not let you ride!<br> He'll be enchanted,<br> with invisible wings...<br> ...to go over every jump, if l ride him!<br> l'll ask you a question. l want you to<br> think it over before you answer.<br> Suppose l told you now<br> that l found a rider?<br> l'd still want to ride myself.<br> l know you're angry<br> but you'll understand.<br> lf you ever rode again,<br> you'd want to win. That's how l feel.<br> Now it's the glory of winning<br> for yourself, is that it?<br> You want to race,<br> take your risks and win.<br> To win over them all,<br> in sight of the world...<br> ...before the King and Queen,<br> is that it?<br> Perhaps you're right.<br> Perhaps l'd want that<br> if l'd ever ride again.<br> Someday l may get the chance.<br> All right. You ride.<br> l knew you'd see! Thank you!<br> There's lots to do!<br> You've got to be lvan Taski.<br> The description will be all right.<br> ''Eyes, blue. Hair, brown.''<br> You'll have to cut my hair.<br> Here.<br> The Pie won't mind you<br> using his scissors on my mane.<br> Go ahead, cut it<br> quite short at the back.<br> l wish your mother were here.<br> She is here. She's inside me.<br> You'll be disqualified at the<br> end when they find out you're a girl.<br> You'll forfeit the prize money.<br> Maybe even go to prison for fraud.<br> lf there's trouble, say it was me.<br> l put you up to it. lt was my idea!<br> There won't be any trouble.<br> lf you're going to ride,<br> there's tricks of the race to learn.<br> Start as fast as you can,<br> and jump sure and clean.<br> And you go twice around the course,<br> that's thirty jumps in all.<br> Let's start at the beginning.<br> The firstjump's a plain hedge jump--<br> Don't tell me anymore.<br> You've got to know the jumps<br> and the tricks of the race.<br> There's a lot to know!<br> lt's no use.<br> Everyone riding tomorrow<br> will know more than l do.<br> lt's no use.<br> Do you think a race like this<br> is won by luck?<br> No.<br> By knowing The Pie can win.<br> And telling him so.<br> Two pounds on Tantibus.<br> A pound on Folsum.<br> l want an outsider.<br> Who has the longest odds?<br> The Pie. 100-to-1.<br> -l'll take a pound on it.<br> -Here you are, Lady.<br> The Pie, a hundred pounds to one.<br> Keep your mouth shut<br> and your eyes down.<br> Sit down here.<br> They're staring!<br> They're whispering.<br> Let them.<br> l seen you somewhere.<br> Newmarket, last year?<br> l've been about.<br> l thought l knew you.<br> Pretty young, ain't he?<br> A Latvian.<br> They teach them young there.<br> You know, like for the Russian ballet.<br> Going to waltz over the course, matey?<br> Save your breath,<br> he doesn't speak English.<br> -What's his horse?<br> -The Pie.<br> Never heard of him!<br> Where's he been running?<br> -The merry-go-round?<br> -Come on, Beasley.<br> Going to ride the National<br> in the skin for England!<br> -Weight?<br> -10.7<br> -They ask your weight and you sit.<br> -l thought he didn't understand English.<br> He's got to learn sometime!<br> All right, off you go.<br> Chair!<br> Sit down.<br> -Weight?<br> -10 even!<br> He doesn't speak English.
