                        This story is about Howard Beale...<br> ...who was the Network News anchorman<br> on UBS TV.<br> In his time, Howard Beale<br> had been a mandarin of television.<br> The grand old man of news, with a HU rating of 16 and a 28 audience share.<br> In 1969, however,<br> his fortunes began to decline.<br> He fell to a 22 share.<br> The following year his wife died,<br> and he was left a childless widower...<br> ...with an 8 rating and a 12 share.<br> He became morose and isolated,<br> began to drink heavily.<br> And on September 22, 1975,<br> he was fired...<br> ...effective in two weeks.<br> The news was broken to him<br> by Max Schumacher...<br> ...who was the president<br> of the news division at UBS.<br> The two old friends got properly pissed.<br> I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in 1951.<br> Must've been 1950, then.<br> I was NBC, uh, associate producer,<br> Morning News.<br> I was just a kid, 26 years old.<br> Anyway....<br> Anyway, they were building the lower level<br> of the George Washington Bridge.<br> We were doing a remote from there.<br> And nobody told me.<br> Then after 7 in the morning, I get a call.<br> "Where the hell are you? You're supposed<br> to be on the George Washington Bridge."<br> I jump out of bed,<br> throw my raincoat over my pajamas.<br> I run down the stairs,<br> I run out in the street, hail a cab.<br> And I say to the cabby, "Take me to the<br> middle of the George Washington Bridge."<br> And the cabbie turns around<br> and he says....<br> He says, "Don't do it, buddy.<br> You're a young man.<br> You got your whole life ahead of you."<br> Didn't I ever tell you that one before?<br> I'm gonna kill myself.<br> Oh, shit, Howard.<br> I'm gonna blow my brains out<br> right on the air.<br> Right in the middle of the 7:00 news.<br> Well, you'll get a hell of a rating,<br> I'll guarantee you that.<br> -50 share easy.<br> -You think so?<br> Well, sure.<br> We could make a series out of it.<br> Suicide of the Week.<br> Hell. Why limit ourselves?<br> Execution of the Week.<br> Terrorist of the Week.<br> I love it.<br> Suicides.<br> Assassinations.<br> Mad bombers, Mafia hit men...<br> ...automobile smashups.<br> The Death Hour.<br> Great Sunday night show<br> for the whole family.<br> We'll wipe that fucking Disney<br> right off the air.<br> Hmm.<br> Let's do the Lenin deportation<br> at the end of three.<br> That strong enough to bump?<br> In one then, I'll do a lead on Sara Jane<br> Moore to Mayberry in San Francisco.<br> In the film I saw,<br> it was the chief of detectives.<br> I think we've got about 10 seconds<br> on the shooting itself.<br> The whole thing is 1:25.<br> -What does that come out?<br> About 4:50.<br> We using Squeaky Fromme?<br> Let's do that in two.<br> Squeaky, Ford at the airport, bump.<br> Now, you using a map<br> going into San Francisco?<br> Um, I prefer our news pics.<br> What have we got left?<br> Gun control, Patty Hearst affidavit.<br> Guerrillas in Chad, OPEC in Vienna.<br> All right, fine. I'll see you later.<br> -Hello, Howard, how are you?<br> Hi. Okay.<br> Don't forget, Howard,<br> Ron Nessen is now 16, okay?<br> Mm-hm.<br> The first attempt on President Ford's life<br> was 18 days ago...<br> ...and again yesterday in San Francisco.<br> In spite of the two attempts...<br> ...Mr. Ford says he will not become<br> a prisoner of the Oval Office...<br> ...a hostage of would-be assassins.<br> The American people are good people:<br> Democrats, Independents,<br> Republicans and others.<br> How the hell you always get mixed up....<br> Under no circumstances will I...<br> ...and I hope no others, capitulate...<br> ...to those that want to undercut...<br> ...what's all good in America.<br> Two, cue Howard.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...I would like to announce<br> that I will be retiring from this program...<br> ...in two weeks' time<br> because of poor ratings.<br> Since this show was the only thing<br> I had going for me in my life...<br> ...I have decided to kill myself.<br> So, what did she say?<br> I'm gonna blow my brains out<br> right on this program, a week from today.<br> Ten seconds to commercial.<br> So tune in next Tuesday.<br> That should give the public-relations people<br> a week to promote the show.<br> We ought to get a hell of a rating<br> out of that. A 50 share, easy.<br> Take Tellison.<br> -Listen.<br> -Uh, did you hear that?<br> -What was that about?<br> Howard just said he was going<br> to blow his brains out next Tuesday.<br> What are you talking about?<br> -Didn't you hear him? He just said--<br> -What's wrong now?<br> Howard just said he was going<br> to kill himself next Tuesday.<br> What do you mean, "Howard just said<br> he was going to kill himself next Tuesday"?<br> He was supposed to do a tag<br> on Ron Nessen--<br> He said, "Tune in next Tuesday.<br> I'm gonna shoot myself."<br> What the hell's going on?<br> He said he<br> was going to blow his brains out.<br> What the fuck's going on, Howard?<br> They wanna know<br> what the fuck's going on.<br> -I can't hear you.<br> -Turn the studio mike on.<br> -We're back on in 11 seconds.<br> Ten seconds.<br> Howard, what are you doing?<br> -Have you flipped?<br> -I think we better get him off.<br> -Get him off.<br> -What's the matter with you?<br> -Get your fucking hands off.<br> -Turn the sound off. He's going out live!<br> We're in a lot of fucking trouble<br> down here.<br> -This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.<br> That's my head.<br> Go to standby. You dumb schmuck!<br> Lou, can't we clear out<br> that downstairs lobby?<br> -There must be a hundred people.<br> -How?<br> Every TV station and wire service<br> in the city. I could barely get in.<br> -Arthur, anything litigable?<br> -Not so far.<br> How many spots were wiped out?<br> -Frank just walked in.<br> We had to abort. What could we do?<br> He's talking to Wheeler.<br> Over 900 phone calls...<br> -...complaining about foul language.<br> Shit.<br> Come on, Mickey,<br> what page are you putting it on?<br> Hackett just walked in.<br> -ABC again, they want the tape.<br> Tell him to go fuck himself.<br> That goes for you too.<br> You're off the air as of now.<br> He wants to talk to you.<br> -Who's replacing Beale tomorrow?<br> -We're flying Snowden up from Washington.<br> -Everybody, hold it.<br> Let's see how the other networks<br> handle this.<br> Ten o'clock news opened with it.<br> Good evening.<br> Howard Beale, one of television's....<br> They're all gonna make it their lead story.<br> Howard Beale interrupted his<br> Network News program tonight...<br> ...to announce<br> that he was gonna kill himself.<br> An unusual thing happened at one<br> of our sister networks, UBS, this evening.<br> How are we handling it?<br> Halloway's going to make a brief statement<br> at the end of the show...<br> ...that Howard's been under<br> great personal stress, et cetera.<br> I'll call you back, John.<br> All right. We've got<br> a stockholders' meeting tomorrow...<br> ...at which we're gonna announce<br> the restructuring-of-management plan.<br> I don't want this grotesque incident<br> to interfere with that.<br> I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short<br> statement, washing this whole thing off.<br> You, Max,<br> you better have some answers...<br> ...for those nuts<br> that come to stockholders' meetings.<br> Mr. Beale has been under<br> professional and personal strain.<br> I've got some surprises<br> for you too, Schumacher.<br> I've had it up to here with your cruddy<br> division and its annual $33 million deficit!<br> You keep your hands off<br> my news division, Frank.<br> We're responsible to corporate level,<br> not you.<br> -Well, goddamn, we'll see about that.<br> -All right, take it easy.<br> Right now,<br> how do we get Beale out of here?<br> I understand there's at least a hundred<br> reporters and camera crews in the lobby.<br> We got a limo at the freight exit.<br> Howard, you're gonna spend the night<br> at my place.<br> There's bound to be press around yours.<br> I want Snowden here by noon.<br> Have Lester cover the CIA hearings...<br> ...and give the White House to Doris.<br> You're late for your screening, Max.<br> Right. Okay.<br> If John Wheeler calls,<br> switch him to Projection Room 7.<br> Margot, come in here a minute.<br> -I'm sorry. This Beale business....<br> -It's all right.<br> Sit down.<br> Diana asked if she could sit in on this.<br> Fine. How's it going?<br> I think you'll like this footage better<br> than the stuff I showed you last time, Max.<br> Max Schumacher.<br> Goddamn it. When, Louise?<br> Laureen?<br> Well, did he say anything?<br> --Communist Party to be these--<br> All right, thank you.<br> --splintered underground groups?<br> The Communist Party believes...<br> ...that the most pressing<br> political necessity today...<br> ...is the consolidation<br> of the revolutionary, radical...<br> ...and democratic movements<br> into a united front.<br> Harry, Howard Beale left my house<br> about 20 minutes ago. Has he come in yet?<br> --of the bourgeois democratic state....<br> Well, let me know when he arrives, huh?<br> That's Laureen Hobbs, isn't it?<br> Yeah. This is from<br> a David Susskind thing a while back.<br> I think we can use some of this stuff.<br> --by the broadest possible coalition....<br> What we're going to see now<br> is something really sensational.<br> The Flagstaff Independent Bank of Arizona<br> was ripped off last week...<br> ...by a terrorist group called<br> the Ecumenical Liberation Army.<br> They actually took movies of the rip-off<br> while they were ripping it off.<br> -Wait till you see it.<br> -The Ecumenical Liberation Army.<br> That's not the one<br> that kidnapped Patty Hearst?<br> No, no.<br> That's the Symbionese Liberation Army.<br> This is the Ecumenical Liberation Army.<br> They're the ones who kidnapped<br> Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.<br> There's a lot of liberation armies<br> in the revolutionary underground...<br> ...and a lot of kidnapped heiresses.<br> This is Mary Ann Gifford.<br> That's the Great Ahmed Kahn,<br> he's their leader.<br> You mean, they actually shot this film...<br> ...while they were ripping off the bank?<br> Wait till you see it. I don't know<br> whether to edit or leave it raw like this.<br> This is terrific stuff.<br> Where did you get it?<br> I got everything through Laureen Hobbs.<br> She's my contact for all this stuff.<br> -Yeah?<br> I've got Howard on the other line.<br> All right, put him on.<br> Howard, I've got Max on 4.<br> Would you pick up?<br> -Listen, Max, I'd like another shot.<br> -Oh, come on, Howard.<br> I don't mean the whole show....<br> I'd just like to come on,<br> make some brief farewell statement...<br> ...and then turn the show over<br> to Jack Snowden.<br> I have 11 years at this network, Max.<br> I have some standing in the industry.<br> I just don't wanna go out like a clown.<br> It'll be simple, dignified.<br> You and Harry can check the copy.<br> I think it'll take the strain<br> off the show, Max.<br> Well, what do you think?<br> Well, okay.<br> And no booze today, Howard.<br> No booze.<br> Summaries have been received.<br> We're forwarding them....<br> George, can, uh, you come into my office<br> for a minute?<br> Right.<br> -Barbara, is Tommy around anywhere?<br> -I think so.<br> I'd like to see the two of you<br> for a moment.<br> Uh, this is Bill Herron from our<br> West Coast Special Programs Department.<br> George Bosch, Barbara Schlesinger,<br> Tommy Pellegrino.<br> Look, I just saw some rough footage<br> of a special Bill's doing...<br> ...on the revolutionary underground.<br> Most is tedious stuff...<br> ...of Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets<br> muttering mutilated Marxism.<br> But he's got about eight minutes<br> of a bank robbery...<br> ...that is absolutely sensational.<br> Authentic stuff.<br> Actually shot<br> while the robbery was going on.<br> You remember<br> the Mary Ann Gifford kidnapping?<br> It's that bunch of nuts. She's in the movie<br> shooting off machine guns.<br> Really terrific footage. I think we can get<br> a hell of a Movie of the Week out of it...<br> ...maybe even a series.<br> A series out of what?<br> What are we talking about?<br> Look, we've got a bunch<br> of hobgoblin radicals...<br> ...called the Ecumenical<br> Liberation Army...<br> ...who go around taking home movies<br> of themselves robbing banks.<br> And maybe they'll take movies<br> of themselves kidnapping heiresses...<br> ...um, hijacking 747s, bombing bridges,<br> assassinating ambassadors.<br> We'd open each week's segment<br> with that authentic footage...<br> ...hire writers to write some story<br> behind that footage...<br> ...and we've got ourselves a series.<br> A series about a bunch<br> of, uh, bank-robbing guerillas?<br> What are we gonna call it,<br> The Mao Tse-Tung Hour?<br> -Ha, ha!<br> Why not?<br> They've got Strike Force, Task Force,<br> SWAT, why not Che Guevara...<br> ...and his own little mod squad?<br> Look, I sent you all<br> a concept-analysis report yesterday.<br> Did any of you read it?<br> Well, in a nutshell, it said<br> the American people are turning sullen.<br> They've been clobbered by Vietnam,<br> Watergate, inflation, the Depression.<br> They've turned off, shot up and fucked<br> themselves limp. And nothing helps.<br> So this concept-analysis report concludes<br> the American people want somebody...<br> ...to articulate their rage for them.<br> I've been telling you people<br> since I took this job six months ago...<br> ...that I want angry shows.<br> I don't want conventional programming<br> on this network, I want counterculture.<br> I want antiestablishment.<br> I don't wanna play butch boss<br> with you people.<br> When I took over this department...<br> ...it had the worst programming record<br> in television history.<br> This network hasn't one show<br> in the top 20.<br> This network is an industry joke.<br> And we better start putting together<br> one winner for next September.<br> I want a show developed based<br> on the activities of a terrorist group.<br> Joseph Stalin<br> and his merry band of Bolsheviks.<br> I want ideas from you people.<br> That is what you're paid for.<br> And, by the way, the next time I send<br> an audience research report around...<br> ...you'd all better read it, or I'll sack<br> the fucking lot of you, is that clear?<br> I'll be out on the coast in, uh, four weeks.<br> Will you set up a meeting<br> with Laureen Hobbs?<br> Sure.<br> But the business of management<br> is management.<br> And at the time CCA took control<br> of the UBS TV Network...<br> ...it was foundering with less than<br> ...most network programs being sold<br> at station rates.<br> I am pleased to announce I am<br> submitting to the board of directors...<br> ...a plan for the coordination<br> of the main profit centers.<br> And with the specific intention...<br> ...of making each division<br> more responsive to management.<br> Point one.<br> The division producing the lowest rate<br> of return has been the news division...<br> ...with its $98 million budget and<br> its average annual deficit of 32 million.<br> I know that, historically, news divisions<br> are expected to lose money.<br> But to our minds, this philosophy<br> is a wanton fiscal affront...<br> ...to be resolutely resisted.<br> The new plan calls for local news to be<br> transferred to owned stations' divisions.<br> News radio would be transferred<br> to the UBS Radio Division and in effect...<br> ...the news division would be reduced<br> from an independent division...<br> ...to a department accountable<br> to network.<br> -What was that all about, Ed?<br> -This is not the time, Max.<br> Why wasn't I told about this?<br> Why was I led up onto that podium<br> and publicly humiliated...<br> ...in front of the stockholders?<br> Goddamn it,<br> I spoke to John Wheeler this morning...<br> ...and he assured me<br> the news division was safe.<br> That's one hell of a way<br> to get me to resign.<br> We'll talk about this tomorrow<br> at our regular morning meeting.<br> Eleven, 10...<br> Roll VTA.<br> ...nine, eight, seven, six.<br> In five, four, three, two....<br> One.<br> One, cue VTA.<br> Cue announcer.<br> The UBS evening news<br> with Howard Beale.<br> Ready, two?<br> Two, cue Howard.<br> Good evening. Today is Wednesday,<br> September the 24th...<br> ...and this is my last broadcast.<br> Yesterday I announced on this program<br> that I was going to commit public suicide.<br> Admittedly an act of madness.<br> Well, I'll tell you what happened.<br> I just ran out of bullshit.<br> -All right, cut him off.<br> -Leave him on.<br> Am I still on the air?<br> If this is how he wants to go out,<br> this is how he goes out.<br> --except I just ran out of bullshit.<br> Mr. Schumacher's right here.<br> Wanna talk to him?<br> Bullshit is all the reasons<br> we give for living.<br> If we can't think up any reasons<br> of our own, we have the God bullshit.<br> Holy Mary, Mother of Christ.<br> -Tom, what is it?<br> --through all this pointless pain,<br> humiliation and decay...<br> ...so there better be someone<br> who does know.<br> That's the God bullshit.<br> He's saying that life is bullshit and it is.<br> What are you screaming about?<br> Man is a noble creature that can order<br> his own world. Who needs God?<br> If there's anybody out there...<br> ...that can look around this<br> slaughterhouse of a world we live in...<br> ...and tell me that man<br> is a noble creature...<br> ...believe me, that man is full of bullshit.<br> -What's so goddamn funny?<br> -I can't help it, Harry. It's funny.<br> Max, this is going out live<br> to 67 affiliates.<br> Leave him on.<br> And I was married for 33 years<br> of shrill, shrieking fraud.<br> -Mr. Hackett's trying to get through to you.<br> -Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.<br> So I don't have any bullshit left.<br> I just ran out of it, you see.<br> Mr. Ruddy, could we have<br> just one statement from you?<br> Sorry, I don't have all the information yet.<br> One question.<br> Could we--? If we could just<br> have one statement about Mr. Beale.<br> Max.<br> I'll want to see Mr. Beale after this.<br> The way I hear it, Max,<br> you were primarily responsible...<br> ...for this colossally stupid prank.<br> -Is that the fact, Max?<br> -That's the fact.<br> It was unconscionable.<br> There doesn't seem<br> to be anything more to say.<br> I have something to say, Ed.<br> I want to know why that whole debasement<br> of the news division...<br> ...announced at the stockholders' meeting<br> this afternoon was kept secret from me.<br> You and I go back 20 years, Ed.<br> I took this job<br> with your personal assurance...<br> ...that you'd back my autonomy<br> against any encroachment.<br> But ever since CCA acquired control<br> of UBS Systems 10 months ago...<br> ...Hackett's been taking over everything.<br> Now who the hell is running this network?<br> You or some conglomerate called CCA?<br> I mean you're president<br> of the Systems Group...<br> ...and Hackett's nothing<br> but a hatchet man for CCA.<br> Nelson here, president of a network...<br> ...and he hasn't a thing<br> to say about anything anymore.<br> I told you at the stockholders' meeting,<br> Max...<br> ...that we would discuss all that<br> at our regular meeting tomorrow morning.<br> If you had been patient...<br> ...I would've explained that<br> I thought Frank Hackett precipitate...<br> ...and that the reorganization<br> of the division...<br> ...would not be executed until everyone,<br> specifically you, Max...<br> ...had been consulted and satisfied.<br> Instead, you sulked off like a child<br> and engaged this network...<br> ...in a shocking and disgraceful episode.<br> Your position is no longer tenable...<br> ...regardless of how management<br> is restructured.<br> I will expect your resignation<br> at 10:00 tomorrow morning...<br> ...and we will coordinate our statements<br> to the least detriment of everyone.<br> Bob McDonough will take over<br> the news division...<br> ...until we can sort all this out.<br> I'd like to see Mr. Beale now.<br> They're looking for him, Ed.<br> They don't know where he is.<br> Every day, five days a week for 15 years,<br> I've been sitting behind that desk.<br> The dispassionate pundit...<br> ...reporting with seemly detachment<br> the daily parade...<br> ...of lunacies that constitute the news.<br> And just once I wanted to say<br> what I really felt.<br> Knock it off, Arthur.<br> It was, after all, my last....<br> -Did the overnight ratings come in yet?<br> -They're on your desk.<br> Have you still got yesterday's overnights?<br> Shall I bring them in?<br> Yeah.<br> These are those four outlines submitted<br> by Universal for an hour series.<br> You needn't bother to read them.<br> I'll tell them to you.<br> The first one is set in a large<br> Eastern law school, presumably Harvard.<br> The series is irresistibly entitled<br> The New Lawyers.<br> The running characters are a crusty<br> but benign ex-Supreme Court Justice...<br> ...presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes<br> by way of Dr. Zorba.<br> There is a beautiful<br> girl graduate student...<br> ...and the district attorney who<br> is brilliant and sometimes cuts corners.<br> Next one.<br> The second one is called<br> The Amazon Squad.<br> Lady cops?<br> The running characters include<br> a crusty but benign lieutenant...<br> ...who's always getting heat<br> from the commissioner...<br> ...a hard-drinking detective<br> who thinks women belong in the kitchen...<br> ...and a brilliant and beautiful<br> young girl cop...<br> -...who's fighting the feminist battle.<br> We're up to our ears in lady cops.<br> The next is another one<br> of those investigative reporter shows.<br> A crusty but benign managing editor<br> who's always--<br> You know, Barbara...<br> ...the Arabs have decided to jack up<br> the price of oil another 20 percent.<br> Uh, the CIA has been caught opening<br> Senator Humphrey's mail.<br> There's a civil war in Angola,<br> another one in Beirut.<br> The-- New York City's still facing default.<br> They finally caught up<br> with Patricia Hearst.<br> And the whole front page<br> of the Daily News is Howard Beale.<br> There's also a two-column story<br> on Page 1 of the Times.<br> Helen, call Mr. Hackett's office.<br> See if he can give me<br> a few minutes this morning.<br> KTNS, Kansas City, refuses to carry<br> our Network News show anymore...<br> ...unless Beale is taken off the air.<br> Did you see the overnights<br> on the Network News?<br> It has an eight in New York, a nine in L.A.<br> and a 27 share in both cities.<br> Last night Howard Beale went on the air<br> and yelled "bullshit" for two minutes...<br> ...and I can tell you right now that tonight's<br> show will get a 30 share, at least.<br> I think we've lucked into something.<br> For God's sakes. Are you suggesting<br> that we put that lunatic...<br> ...back on the air yelling "bullshit"?<br> I think we should put Beale back<br> on the air tonight and keep him on.<br> Did you see the news this morning?<br> Did you see the Times?<br> We've got press on this you couldn't buy<br> for a million dollars. Frank.<br> That dumb show jumped<br> five rating points in one night.<br> Tonight's show has gotta be at least 15.<br> We just increased our audience<br> by 20 or 30 million people in one night.<br> You're not gonna get this<br> dumped in your lap...<br> ...for the rest of your days.<br> You can't piss it away.<br> Howard Beale said<br> what every American feels...<br> ...that he's tired of all the bullshit.<br> He's articulating the popular rage.<br> I want that show, Frank. I can turn that<br> show into the biggest smash on television.<br> What do you mean? It's a news show.<br> It's not your department.<br> I see Howard Beale<br> as a latter-day prophet.<br> A magnificent, messianic figure inveighing<br> against the hypocrisies of our times.<br> A strip Savonarola,<br> Monday through Friday...<br> ...that I tell you, Frank,<br> could just go through the roof...<br> ...and I'm talking about a $6 cost<br> per thousand show.<br> I'm talking about a hundred--<br> A 130,000-dollar minutes.<br> Do you wanna figure out<br> the revenues of a strip show...<br> ...that sells for 100,000 bucks a minute?<br> One show like that could pull<br> this network out of the hole.<br> Frank, it's being handed to us on a plate.<br> Let's not blow it.<br> Yes?<br> Tell him I'll be a few minutes.<br> Let me think it over.<br> Frank, let's not go to committee on this.<br> It's 20 after 10.<br> We want Beale in that studio.<br> We don't wanna lose the momentum.<br> For God's sake, Diana...<br> ...we're talking about putting a manifestly<br> irresponsible man on national television.<br> I'd like to talk to Legal Affairs at least<br> and Herb Thackeray...<br> ...and certainly Joe Donnelly<br> in Standards and Practices.<br> And you know, I'm going to be eyeball<br> to eyeball with Mr. Ruddy on this.<br> If I'm going to the mat with Ruddy,<br> I wanna make sure of some of my ground.<br> I'm the one whose ass is going on the line.<br> I'll get back to you, Diana.<br> I don't believe this.<br> I don't believe the top brass...<br> ...of a national television network<br> are sitting around their salads--<br> The top brass of a bankrupt<br> national television network...<br> ...with projected losses<br> of close to $150 million.<br> I don't care how bankrupt.<br> You can't be seriously proposing,<br> and the rest of us seriously considering...<br> ...putting on a pornographic<br> Network News show.<br> -The FCC'd kill us.<br> -Sit down, Nelson.<br> The FCC can't do anything<br> except rap our knuckles.<br> I don't even wanna think about<br> the litigious possibilities, Frank.<br> -Could be up to our ears in lawsuits.<br> -The affiliates won't carry it.<br> Affiliates will kiss your ass,<br> if you can hand them a hit show.<br> The popular reaction--<br> We don't know the popular reaction.<br> We have to find out.<br> The New York Times--<br> The New York Times<br> doesn't advertise on our network.<br> All I know is this violates every canon<br> of respectable broadcasting.<br> We're not a respectable network.<br> We're a whorehouse network.<br> We have to take whatever we can get.<br> Well, I don't want any part of it.<br> I don't fancy myself<br> the president of a whorehouse.<br> That's very commendable of you, Nelson.<br> Now, sit down.<br> Your indignation has been duly recorded.<br> You can always resign tomorrow.<br> Now look,<br> what in substance are we proposing?<br> Merely to add editorial comment<br> to our Network News show.<br> Brinkley, Sevareid, Reasoner,<br> all have their comments.<br> Now Howard Beale will have his.<br> I think we ought to give it a shot.<br> Let's see what happens tonight.<br> Telephone, please.<br> I don't wanna be the messenger<br> that has to tell Max Schumacher.<br> Max doesn't work<br> at this network anymore.<br> Mr. Ruddy fired him last night.<br> Bob McDonough's running<br> the news division now.<br> Bob McDonough in News, please.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I may teach or I may write a book...<br> ...whatever the hell one does<br> when one approaches...<br> ...the autumn of one's years.<br> My God, is that me?<br> -Was I ever that young?<br> -Ha, ha.<br> No. Howard just brought<br> in a picture of Ed Murrow...<br> ...and the whole CBS gang<br> when we were there.<br> You wouldn't believe it.<br> Walter Cronkite, Harry Reasoner,<br> Hollenbeck, Bob Trout.<br> -Is that you, Howard?<br> -Mm-hm.<br> Yeah.<br> -Okay, Dick, we'll be in touch. Right.<br> -You remember this kid?<br> He's the kid I think you once sent out to<br> interview Cleveland Amory on vivisection.<br> What's so funny?<br> So I jump out of bed in my pajamas,<br> I grab my raincoat, I run downstairs.<br> I run out in the street and I hail a cab.<br> And I jumped in and I yell at the driver:<br> "Take me to the middle<br> of the George Washington Bridge."<br> And the driver turns around and he says:<br> "Don't do it, buddy, don't do it.<br> You're young,<br> you got your whole life ahead of you."<br> Ha-ha-ha!<br> Wait a minute! Wait a minute!<br> If you think that's funny--<br> No, if you think that's funny,<br> wait till you hear this.<br> I've just come back<br> from Frank Hackett's office.<br> He wants to put Howard on the air.<br> -You're kidding.<br> -Apparently...<br> ...the ratings went up<br> five points last night...<br> ...and he wants Howard to go back on<br> and do his angry-man thing.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm telling you. They want Howard<br> to go back on and yell "bullshit."<br> They want Howard to go on spontaneously<br> letting out his anger.<br> A latter-day prophet denouncing<br> the hypocrisies of our times.<br> Hey, that sounds pretty good.<br> Who's this "they"?<br> Hackett. Chaney was there.<br> The Legal Affairs guy.<br> Oh, and that girl from Programming.<br> Christensen?<br> What's she got to do with this?<br> You're kidding, aren't you?<br> -I'm not kidding.<br> I told them. I said:<br> "Look, we're running a news department,<br> not a circus.<br> And Howard Beale's not a bearded lady.<br> If you think I'm gonna go along<br> with this bastardization...<br> ...you can have my resignation along<br> with Max Schumacher's right now.<br> I think I'm speaking for Howard Beale<br> and everybody else--"<br> That's my job you're turning down.<br> I'd go nuts without some kind of work.<br> What's wrong with being an angry prophet<br> denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?<br> What do you think, Max?<br> Do you want to be an angry prophet<br> denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?<br> Yeah, I think I'd like to be an angry prophet<br> denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.<br> Then grab it. Grab it!<br> -Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.<br> -Good afternoon.<br> Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.<br> -He's waiting for you, Mr. Ruddy.<br> Thank you.<br> Nelson Chaney tells me Beale<br> may actually go on the air this evening.<br> As far as I know,<br> Howard's going to do it.<br> You going to sit still for this, Ed?<br> Yes.<br> I think Hackett's overstepped himself.<br> There's some kind of corporate<br> maneuvering going on, Max.<br> Hackett is clearly forcing a confrontation.<br> That would account for his behavior<br> at the stockholders' meeting.<br> However, I think he's making a serious<br> mistake with this Beale business.<br> I suspect CCA will be upset<br> at Hackett's presumptuousness.<br> Certainly Mr. Jensen will.<br> So I'm going to let Hackett<br> have his head for a while.<br> He just might lose it over<br> this Beale business.<br> I'd like you to reconsider<br> your resignation, Max.<br> I assume that Hackett<br> wouldn't take such steps...<br> ...without some support<br> on the CCA board.<br> I'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen.<br> When that happens,<br> I'm going to need every friend I've got.<br> And I certainly don't want Hackett's<br> people in all of the divisional positions.<br> So I'd like you to stay on, Max.<br> Of course, Ed.<br> Thank you, Max.<br> This has been the UBS<br> evening news with Howard Beale.<br> The initial response to the new<br> Howard Beale Show was not auspicatory.<br> The press was without exception hostile<br> and the industry reaction negative.<br> The ratings for the Thursday<br> and Friday shows were both 14.<br> But Monday's rating dropped a point...<br> ...clearly suggesting<br> the novelty was wearing off.<br> Did you know there are<br> a number of psychics...<br> ...working as licensed brokers<br> on Wall Street?<br> Some of them counsel their clients<br> by use of tarot cards.<br> They're all pretty successful,<br> even in a bear market and selling short.<br> I met one of them last week<br> and thought of doing a show around her.<br> The Wayward Witch of Wall Street,<br> something like that.<br> If her tips were any good,<br> she could wreck the market.<br> So I called her this morning and asked her<br> how she was on predicting the future.<br> She said she was occasionally prescient.<br> For example, she said:<br> "I just had a fleeting vision of you...<br> ...sitting in an office<br> with a craggy middle-aged man...<br> ...with whom you are,<br> or will be, emotionally involved."<br> And here I am.<br> And she does all this with tarot cards?<br> No. This one operates on parapsychology.<br> She has trance-like episodes<br> and feels things in her energy field.<br> I think this lady could<br> be very useful to you, Max.<br> -In what way?<br> -Well...<br> ...you put on a news show<br> and here's somebody who can predict...<br> ...tomorrow's news for you.<br> Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.<br> Sibyl the Soothsayer.<br> You could give her two minutes of trance<br> at the end of a Howard Beale Show...<br> ...say, once a week, Friday...<br> ...which is suggestively occult,<br> and she could oraculate.<br> Then next week everyone tunes in to see<br> how good her predictions were.<br> Maybe she could do the weather.<br> Your Network News is going to need<br> some help, Max, if it's gonna hold.<br> Beale doesn't do<br> the angry-man thing well at all.<br> He's too, uh, kvetchy. He's being irascible.<br> We want a prophet, not a curmudgeon.<br> He should do more apocalyptic doom.<br> I think you should take on a couple of<br> writers to write some jeremiads for him.<br> I see you don't fancy my suggestions.<br> Hell, you're not serious, are you?<br> Oh, I'm serious.<br> The fact is I could make your Beale Show<br> the highest-rated news show...<br> ...in television,<br> if you'd let me have a crack at it.<br> -What do you mean, "have a crack at it"?<br> -I'd like to program it for you. Develop it.<br> I wouldn't interfere with the actual news<br> itself, but TV is showbiz, Max.<br> And even the news<br> has to have a little showmanship.<br> My God, you are serious.<br> Oh. I watched your 6:00 news today.<br> It's straight tabloid.<br> You had a minute and a half of that lady<br> riding a bike naked in Central Park.<br> You had less than a minute of hard national<br> and international news.<br> It was all sex, scandal,<br> brutal crimes, sports...<br> ...children with incurable diseases<br> and lost puppies.<br> I don't think I'll listen to any protestations<br> of high standards of journalism...<br> ...when you're soliciting audiences<br> like the rest of us.<br> All I'm saying is, if you're gonna hustle,<br> at least do it right.<br> I'm gonna bring this up<br> at tomorrow's meeting.<br> I don't like network hassles. I was hoping<br> you and I could work this out.<br> Now that's why I'm here.<br> And I was hoping that you were looking<br> for an emotional involvement...<br> ...with a craggy middle-aged man.<br> Oh, I wouldn't rule that out entirely.<br> All right, Diana.<br> You bring up all your ideas<br> at the meeting tomorrow...<br> ...because if you don't, I will.<br> I think Howard's making<br> a goddamn fool of himself...<br> ...and so does everybody<br> that Howard and I know in this industry.<br> It was a fluke. It didn't work.<br> So tomorrow,<br> Howard goes back to the old format...<br> ...and all of this gutter depravity<br> comes to an end.<br> Okay.<br> I don't get it, Diana.<br> You hung around until 7:30<br> and then came all the way down here...<br> ...just to pitch a couple<br> of loony showbiz ideas...<br> ...when you knew goddamn well<br> I'd laugh you right out of the office.<br> I don't get it.<br> What's your scam in this?<br> Max, my little visit here tonight...<br> ...was a gesture made out of your stature<br> in the industry...<br> ...and because I personally admired you<br> since I was a kid majoring in speech...<br> ...at the University of Missouri.<br> Sooner or later, with or without you...<br> ...I'm going to take over<br> your Network News show...<br> ...and I figured<br> I might as well start tonight.<br> I, uh, think I once gave a lecture...<br> ...at the University of Missouri.<br> I was in the audience.<br> I had a terrible schoolgirl crush<br> on you for a couple of months.<br> If we could get back for a moment<br> to that gypsy...<br> ...who predicted all that about, uh, emotional<br> involvements and middle-aged men.<br> What are you doing for dinner tonight?<br> I can't make it tonight, love.<br> Call me tomorrow.<br> -Do you have a favorite restaurant?<br> -I eat anything.<br> Son of a bitch,<br> I get a feeling I'm being made.<br> You are.<br> Ah, I've got to warn you,<br> I don't do anything on my first date.<br> We'll see.<br> Schmuck, what are you getting into?<br> I was married for four years<br> and pretended to be happy...<br> ...and had six years of analysis<br> and pretended to be sane.<br> My husband ran off with his boyfriend...<br> ...and I had an affair with my analyst.<br> He told me I was the worst lay<br> he'd ever had.<br> I can't tell you how many men<br> have told me what a lousy lay I am.<br> I apparently have<br> a masculine temperament.<br> I arouse quickly,<br> consummate prematurely...<br> ...and can't wait to get my clothes back on<br> and get out of that bedroom.<br> I seem to be inept at everything<br> except my work.<br> I'm good at my work.<br> So I confine myself to that.<br> All I want out of life<br> is a 30 share and a 20 rating.<br> You're married, surely?<br> Twenty-five years.<br> I have a married daughter in Seattle<br> who's six months pregnant...<br> ...a younger girl who's starting<br> at Northwestern in January.<br> Well, Max, here we are.<br> Middle-aged man reaffirming<br> his middle-aged manhood...<br> ...and a terrified young woman<br> with a father complex.<br> What sort of script do you think<br> we can make out of this?<br> Corridor gossip, uh, says that you are<br> Frank Hackett's backstage girl.<br> Ha, ha. I'm not.<br> Frank is a corporation man,<br> body and soul.<br> He has no loves, lusts or allegiances<br> that are not consummately directed...<br> ...toward becoming a CCA board member.<br> So why should he bother with me?<br> I'm not even a stockholder.<br> What about your loves,<br> lusts and allegiances?<br> Is your wife in town?<br> Yes.<br> Well, then, we better go to my place.<br> I can't hear you.<br> You will have to talk a little louder.<br> Yes. I hear you.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Why me?<br> I said, "Why me?"<br> Okay.<br> Howard in his office?<br> Oh, Harry, I'm killing this whole<br> screwball, angry-prophet thing.<br> -Tonight we go back to straight news.<br> -Okay.<br> Fifteen seconds, 14, 13....<br> Yeah? What?<br> Max, I'm telling you, he's fine.<br> He's been sharp all day.<br> He's been funny as hell. Had everybody<br> cracking up at the rundown meeting.<br> I told him. I told him.<br> Up. Cue VTA.<br> Ready, two.<br> Cue announcer.<br> The UBS Evening News<br> with Howard Beale.<br> Take 2, cue Howard.<br> Last night, I was awakened<br> from a fitful sleep...<br> ...shortly after 2:00 in the morning...<br> ...by a shrill, sibilant, faceless voice.<br> I couldn't make it out at first<br> in the dark bedroom...<br> ...and I said, "I'm sorry,<br> you will have to talk a little louder."<br> -What do you want me to do?<br> -Nothing.<br> And the voice said to me,<br> "I want you to tell the people the truth.<br> Not an easy thing to do because<br> the people don't want to know."<br> And I said, "You're kidding.<br> What the hell should I know<br> about the truth?"<br> But the voice said to me,<br> "Don't worry about the truth.<br> I will put the words in your mouth."<br> I said, "What's this, the Burning Bush?<br> For God's sake, I'm not Moses."<br> The voice said to me, "And I'm not God.<br> What has that got to do with it?"<br> The voice said to me:<br> "We're not talking about eternal<br> or absolute or ultimate truth.<br> We're talking about impermanent,<br> transient, human truth.<br> I don't expect you people<br> to be capable of truth...<br> ...but at least you're capable of<br> self-preservation."<br> And I said, "Why me?"<br> And the voice said,<br> "Because you're on television, dummy.<br> Beautiful.<br> You have 40 million Americans<br> listening to you.<br> After this show, you could have 50.<br> I'm not asking you to walk the land<br> in sackcloth, preaching the Armageddon.<br> You're on TV, man."<br> So I thought about it for a moment...<br> ...and then I said, "Okay."<br> Close the door, Harry.<br> Howard, I'm taking you off the air.<br> I think you're having a breakdown.<br> Require treatment.<br> This is not a psychotic episode.<br> This is a cleansing moment of clarity.<br> I'm imbued, Max.<br> I'm imbued with some special spirit.<br> It's not a religious feeling at all.<br> It's a shocking eruption<br> of great electrical energy.<br> I feel vivid and flashing,<br> as if suddenly...<br> ...I'd been plugged into some<br> great electromagnetic field.<br> I feel connected to all living things.<br> To flowers...<br> ...birds, all the animals of the world...<br> ...and even to some great<br> unseen living force.<br> What I think the Hindus call prana.<br> It is not a breakdown.<br> I've never felt more orderly in my life.<br> It is a shattering and beautiful sensation.<br> It is the exalted flow<br> of the space-time continuum...<br> ...save that it is spaceless<br> and timeless and...<br> ...of such loveliness.<br> I feel on the verge<br> of some great ultimate truth.<br> And you will not take me off the air<br> for now, or for any other spaceless time.<br> Oh, boy.<br> Is he okay?<br> He's just fainted.<br> I'd better get him back<br> to my house again tonight.<br> Help me get him up.<br> Everyone's going crazy.<br> The whole place has gone crazy.<br> Sitting in their house<br> and they don't do anything about it.<br> Wake up, Max, because Howard's gone.<br> I'll make you some coffee.<br> You don't know where he is?<br> The son of a bitch is a hit, goddamn it!<br> Over 2000 phone calls.<br> Go down to the mail room.<br> As of this minute, over 14,000 telegrams!<br> The response is sensational! Tell him.<br> Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing.<br> Every goddamned affiliate<br> from Albuquerque to Sandusky.<br> The response is sensational!<br> Yes. All right. For you, Herb.<br> Get back to your office.<br> Moldanian called me.<br> Joe Donnelly called me.<br> We got a goddamn hit, goddamn it.<br> Diana, show him the Times.<br> We got an editorial<br> in the holy goddamn New York Times.<br> -"A call to morality."<br> -I don't know where he is.<br> That son of a bitch Beale<br> has caught on.<br> -Don't tell me you don't know.<br> -Could be jumping off a roof for all I know.<br> The man is insane.<br> He's not responsible for himself.<br> He needs care and treatment.<br> And all you grave robbers<br> think about is that he's a hit.<br> You know, Max,<br> it's just possible that he isn't insane.<br> That he is, in fact, imbued<br> with some special spirit.<br> My God,<br> I'm supposed to be the romantic...<br> ...you're the hard-bitten realist.<br> All right.<br> Howard Beale obviously fills a void.<br> The audience out there wants a prophet,<br> even a manufactured one...<br> ...even if he's as mad as Moses.<br> By tomorrow he'll have a 50 share,<br> maybe even a 60.<br> Howard Beale is processed,<br> instant God.<br> It looks like he may just go bigger<br> than Mary Tyler Moore.<br> I am not putting Howard back on the air.<br> It's not your show anymore, Max,<br> it's mine.<br> I gave her the show, Schumacher.<br> I'm putting the Network News show<br> under programming.<br> Mr. Ruddy has had a mild heart attack<br> and is not taking calls.<br> In his absence,<br> I'm making all network decisions...<br> ...including one I've been wanting<br> to make a long time.<br> You're fired.<br> I want you out of this building by noon.<br> I'll call the security guards and have you<br> thrown out, if you're still here.<br> Well, let's say, "Fuck you, Hackett."<br> You want me out, you're gonna have to<br> drag me out kicking and screaming...<br> ...and the whole division<br> kicking with me!<br> Gonna quit their jobs for you?<br> Not in this recession.<br> When Ruddy gets back<br> he'll have your ass.<br> I got a hit, Schumacher,<br> and Ruddy doesn't count anymore.<br> He was hoping I'd fall on my face<br> with this Beale Show, but I didn't.<br> It's a big, fat, big-titted hit and I don't have<br> to waffle around with Ruddy anymore.<br> If he wants to take me up<br> before the CCA Board, let him.<br> Think Ruddy is stupid enough<br> to go to the CCA Board and say:<br> "I'm taking our one hit show off the air"?<br> And comes November 14,<br> I'm going to be standing up there...<br> ...at the annual CCA<br> management meeting.<br> I'm gonna announce projected earnings<br> for this network...<br> ...for the first time in five years.<br> And believe me, Mr. Jensen's going<br> to be sitting there rocking back and forth...<br> ...in his little chair and he's going to say:<br> "That's very good, Frank, keep it up."<br> Don't have any illusions about who's<br> running this network.

Exemplary. Keep it up.<br> Buy you a cup of coffee?<br> Hell, yes.<br> -Do you have to get back to the office?<br> -Nothing that can't wait.<br> I....<br> I drop down to the news studios<br> every now and then...<br> ...and ask Howard Beale about you,<br> and he says you're doing fine. Are you?<br> No.<br> -Are you keeping busy?<br> -Oh, in a fashion.<br> This is the, uh, third funeral<br> I've been to in two weeks.<br> I have two other friends<br> in the hospital whom I visit regularly...<br> ...and, uh, been to a couple of christenings.<br> All my friends seem to be dying<br> or having grandchildren.<br> You should be a grandfather yourself<br> about now.<br> You have a pregnant daughter<br> in Seattle, don't you?<br> Any day now.<br> My wife's out there for the occasion.<br> I've thought many times of calling you.<br> I wish you had.<br> You know, I bumped into Sibyl<br> the Soothsayer in the elevator last week.<br> I said, "You know, Sibyl,<br> about four months ago you predicted...<br> ...I would get involved<br> with a craggy, middle-aged man...<br> ...and so far, all that's happened<br> has been one many-splendored night.<br> I don't call that 'getting involved."'<br> And she said, "Don't worry, you will."<br> It was a many-splendored night,<br> wasn't it, Max?<br> Yes, it was.<br> Are we going to get involved, Max?<br> Yes.<br> I need to become involved very much.<br> How about you?<br> I've reached for the phone to call you<br> a hundred times.<br> I was sure you hated me for my part<br> in taking your news show away.<br> I probably did. I don't know anymore.<br> All I know is,<br> I can't get you out of my mind.<br> Marty.<br> Marty, I know what NBC offered them...<br> ...so I'm saying go to 3.5...<br> ...and I want an option<br> for a third run on all of them.<br> Marty, I'm in a big hurry and you and Charlie<br> are supposed to be negotiating this...<br> ...so goodbye, good luck,<br> I'll see you Monday.<br> Jimmy Caan's agent just called<br> and says absolutely nix.<br> Can't win them all.<br> -Where can I reach you later?<br> You can't. I'll be gone all weekend.<br> NBC's offering $3.25 mil...<br> ...per package<br> of five James Bond movies...<br> ...and I think I'm gonna steal them<br> for $3.5 million with a third run.<br> And I'm gonna stick<br> The Mao Tse-Tung Hour in at 8...<br> ...because we're having a lot of trouble<br> selling The Mao Tse-Tung Hour.<br> This way....<br> That Mao Tse-Tung Hour's<br> turning into one big pain in the ass.<br> We're having heavy legal problems<br> with the federal government right now.<br> Two FBI guys turned up<br> in Hackett's office last week...<br> ...and served us with a subpoena.<br> They heard about our Flagstaff bank<br> rip-off film and they want it.<br> Hackett told the FBI to fuck off.<br> No, but we're getting around the FBI...<br> ...by doing the show in collaboration<br> with the news division.<br> We're standing on the First Amendment,<br> Freedom of the Press...<br> ...and the right to protect our sources.<br> Walter thinks we can knock out<br> the misprision of felony charge. Ha, ha.<br> But he says absolutely nix<br> on going to series.<br> They'll hit us with conspiracy<br> and inducement to commit a crime.<br> Christ, it's cold in here.<br> See, we're paying these nuts<br> from the Ecumenical Liberation Army...<br> ...$10,000 a week in order to turn in<br> authentic film footage...<br> ...of their revolutionary activities...<br> ...and that can constitute inducement<br> to commit a crime.<br> And Walter says we'll all wind up<br> in federal prison.<br> I said,<br> "Walter, let the government sue us.<br> Let the federal government sue us.<br> We'll take them to the Supreme Court.<br> We'll be front page, mm, for months.<br> The New York Times<br> and The Washington Post...<br> ...will be writing two editorials a week<br> about us.<br> We'll be front page for months.<br> We'll have more press than Watergate."<br> All I need is six weeks' federal litigation...<br> ...and The Mao Tse-Tung Hour<br> can start carrying its own time slot.<br> What's really bugging me now<br> is my daytime programming.<br> NBC's got a lock on daytime...<br> ...with their lousy game shows...<br> ...and I'd like to bust them.<br> I'm thinking of doing<br> a homosexual soap opera.<br> The Dykes.<br> The heart-rendering saga<br> about a woman hopelessly in love...<br> ...with her husband's mistress.<br> What do you think?<br> How long has it been going on?<br> A month.<br> I thought it was a transient thing,<br> blow over in a week.<br> And I still pray to God<br> it's just a menopausal infatuation.<br> But it is an infatuation, Louise.<br> There's no sense in my saying<br> I won't see her again, because I will.<br> Do you want me to leave?<br> Check into a hotel?<br> Do you love her?<br> I don't know how I feel.<br> I'm grateful I can feel anything.<br> I know I'm obsessed with her.<br> Then say it.<br> Don't keep telling me that<br> you're obsessed, that you're infatuated.<br> Say that you're in love with her.<br> I'm in love with her.<br> Then get out!<br> Go anywhere you want. Go to a hotel,<br> go live with her, but don't come back.<br> Because after 25 years...<br> ...of building a home and raising a family<br> and all the senseless pain...<br> ...that we have inflicted on each other,<br> I'm damned if I'm gonna stand here...<br> ...and have you tell me<br> you're in love with somebody else.<br> Because this isn't a convention weekend<br> with your secretary, is it?<br> Or some broad that you picked up<br> after three belts of booze.<br> This is your great winter romance,<br> isn't it?<br> Your last roar of passion before you settle<br> into your emeritus years.<br> Is that what's left for me?<br> Is that my share?

We're number one!<br> We're number one!<br> We're number one!<br> We're number one!<br> We're number one!<br> It is exactly 7:00 here in Los Angeles.<br> And right now, over a million homes<br> using television in this city...<br> ...are turning their dials to Channel 3<br> and that's our channel!<br> Howard Beale!<br> Stop it, stop it!<br> Now you listen to me.<br> And listen carefully because this is your<br> goddamn life I'm talking about today.<br> In this country, when one company wants<br> to take over another company...<br> ...they buy up a controlling share<br> of the stock...<br> ...but first they have to file notice<br> with the government.<br> That's how CCA took over the company<br> that owns this network.<br> But now, somebody's buying up CCA.<br> Somebody called<br> the Western World Funding Corporation.<br> They filed the notice this morning.<br> Well, just who in the hell is<br> the Western World Funding Corporation?<br> It is a consortium of banks<br> and insurance companies...<br> ...who are not buying CCA for themselves,<br> but as agents for somebody else.<br> Who is this somebody else?<br> They won't tell you.<br> They won't tell you,<br> they won't tell the Senate...<br> ...they won't tell the SEC, the FTC,<br> they won't tell the Justice Department....<br> This is Mr. Hackett.<br> Do you have a New York call for me?<br> The hell it ain't!<br> -Do you wanna turn that down, please?<br> I will tell you<br> who they're buying CCA for.<br> They're buying it for the Saudi Arabian<br> Investment Corporation.<br> They're buying it for the Arabs!<br> Clarence? Frank Hackett here.<br> How's everything back in New York?<br> How's the good lady?<br> All right, Clarence, take it easy.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> When? Tonight's show?<br> Clarence, take it easy.<br> The Howard Beale Show<br> is just going on out here.<br> You guys get it three hours earlier<br> in New York. Clarence, take it easy.<br> How the hell could I see it?<br> It's just going on now!<br> And there's not a single law<br> in the books to stop them.<br> When did Mr. Jensen call?<br> We all know that the Arabs control<br> $16 billion in this country.<br> They own a chunk of 5th Avenue...<br> ...twenty downtown pieces of Boston.<br> A part of the port of New Orleans.<br> An industrial park in Salt Lake City.<br> They own big hunks of the Atlanta Hilton,<br> the Arizona Land and Cattle Company...<br> ...part of a bank in California...<br> ...the Bank of the Commonwealth<br> in Detroit.<br> They control Aramco, so that puts<br> them into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil Oil.<br> They're all over! New Jersey,<br> Louisville, St. Louis, Missouri...<br> ...and that's only what we know about.<br> There's a hell of a lot more<br> we don't know about.<br> Because all of those Arab petrol dollars...<br> ...are washed through<br> Switzerland and Canada...<br> ...and the biggest banks in this country.<br> For example, what we don't know<br> about is this CCA deal...<br> ...and all the other CCA deals.<br> Right now the Arabs have screwed us<br> out of enough American dollars...<br> ...to come right back and, with our<br> own money, buy General Motors...<br> ...IBM, ITT, AT&T, Dupont, U.S. Steel...<br> ...and 20 other American companies.<br> Hell, they already own half of England.<br> So listen to me.<br> Listen to me, goddamn it.<br> The Arabs are simply buying us.<br> There's only one thing<br> that can stop them. You!<br> You!<br> So I want you to get up now.<br> I want you to get up out of your chairs.<br> I want you to get up right now<br> and go to the phone.<br> I want you to get up from your chairs,<br> go to the phone, get in your cars...<br> ...drive into the Western Union<br> offices in town.<br> I want you to send a telegram<br> to the White House.<br> -Oh, my God.<br> -By midnight tonight...<br> ...I want a million telegrams<br> in the White House.<br> I want them wading knee-deep<br> in telegrams at the White House.<br> I want you to get up right now and write<br> a telegram to President Ford saying:<br> "I'm as mad as hell<br> and I'm not gonna take this anymore.<br> I don't want the banks<br> selling my country to the Arabs.<br> I want the CCA deal stopped now.<br> I want the CCA deal stopped now.<br> Come on.<br> I want the CCA deal stopped now!<br> I want the CCA deal stopped now!<br> I want the CCA deal stopped now!<br> I want the CCA deal stopped now!<br> -Look, could we have the room?<br> Sure.<br> Well, I'd like to see a typescript<br> and run through a couple more times.<br> But as for this whole CCA deal<br> with the Saudis...<br> ...you'd know a lot more<br> about that, Frank, than I would.<br> Is it true?<br> The CCA has 2 billion in loans<br> with the Saudis...<br> ...and they hold every pledge we've got.<br> We need that Saudi money bad.<br> Disaster. The show is a disaster.<br> Unmitigated disaster. The death knell.<br> I'm ruined. I'm dead. Finished.<br> Maybe we're overstating<br> Beale's clout with the public.<br> An hour ago, Clarence McElheny<br> called me from New York.<br> It was 10:00 in the east and our people<br> in the White House report...<br> ...they were already knee-deep in telegrams.<br> By tomorrow morning,<br> they'll be suffocating in telegrams.<br> -Can the government stop the deal?<br> -They can hold it up.<br> The SEC could hold this deal up<br> for 20 years, if they wanted to.<br> I'm finished.<br> Any second that phone's gonna ring<br> and Clarence McElheny is gonna tell me...<br> ...Mr. Jensen wants me in his office<br> tomorrow morning...<br> ...so he can personally chop my head off.<br> Four hours ago,<br> I was the sun god at CCA.<br> Mr. Jensen's hand-picked golden boy,<br> the heir apparent.<br> Now, ha, ha,<br> I'm a man without a corporation.<br> Let's get back to Howard Beale.<br> You're not seriously gonna pull Beale<br> off the air?<br> Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale<br> and wants him discontinued.<br> But he may be unhappy,<br> but he isn't stupid enough...<br> ...to withdraw the number-one show<br> on television out of pique.<br> Two billion dollars isn't pique!<br> That's the wrath of God!<br> And the wrath of God<br> wants Howard Beale fired!<br> Every other network will grab him<br> the minute he walks.<br> He'll be back on the air for ABC<br> and we'll lose 20 points--<br> I'm gonna impale the son of a bitch<br> with a sharp stick!<br> Forty million loss in revenues.<br> -I'll take out a contract.<br> -Let's not discount federal action....<br> -I'll hire professional killers.<br> No, I'll do it myself.<br> I'll strangle him with a sash cord!<br> --and a breach of the consent decree.<br> I don't think Jensen's gonna fire anybody.<br> Hackett.<br> Yes, Clarence.<br> I've already booked my flight.<br> Uh, well, can you give me<br> a little more time than that?<br> I've got the red-eye flight,<br> I won't be back in New York...<br> ...till 6 tomorrow morning.<br> That'll be just fine.<br> I'll see you then.<br> Mr. Jensen wants to meet<br> Howard Beale personally.<br> He wants Mr. Beale in his office<br> at 10:00 tomorrow morning.<br> The final revelation is at hand.<br> I have seen the shattering fulgurations<br> of ultimate clarity.<br> The light is impending.<br> I bear witness to the light!<br> Good morning, Mr. Beale.<br> -They tell me you're a madman.<br> -Only desultorily.<br> -How are you now?<br> -I'm as mad as a hatter.<br> Who isn't?<br> I'm going to take you<br> into our conference room.<br> Seems more seemly a setting<br> for what I have to say to you.<br> I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale.<br> I sold sewing machines<br> and automobile parts...<br> ...hairbrushes and electronic equipment.<br> They say I can sell anything.<br> I'd like to try to sell something to you.<br> Valhalla, Mr. Beale. Please, sit down.<br> You have meddled with the primal forces<br> of nature, Mr. Beale.<br> And I won't have it! Is that clear?<br> You think you've merely stopped<br> a business deal.<br> That is not the case.<br> The Arabs have taken billions of dollars<br> out of this country...<br> ...and now they must put it back!<br> It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity,<br> it is ecological balance.<br> You are an old man...<br> ...who thinks in terms<br> of nations and peoples.<br> There are no nations, there are no peoples.<br> There are no Russians.<br> There are no Arabs.<br> There are no Third Worlds.<br> There is no West!<br> There is only one holistic system<br> of systems.<br> One vast and immane...<br> ...interwoven, interacting, multi-variate...<br> ...multinational dominion of dollars.<br> Petrol dollars, electro-dollars,<br> multi-dollars.<br> Reichsmarks, rins, rubles,<br> pounds and shekels.<br> It is the international system of currency<br> which determines...<br> ...the totality of life on this planet.<br> That is the natural order of things today.<br> That is the atomic...<br> ...and subatomic...<br> ...and galactic structure<br> of things today.<br> And you have meddled...<br> ...with the primal forces of nature!<br> And you will atone.<br> Am I getting it through to you, Mr. Beale?<br> You get up on your little 21-inch screen...<br> ...and howl about America<br> and democracy.<br> There is no America.<br> There is no democracy.<br> There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T...<br> ...and Dupont, Dow,<br> Union Carbide, and Exxon.<br> Those are the nations of the world today.<br> What do you think the Russians talk about<br> in their councils of state? Karl Marx?<br> They get out their<br> linear programming charts...<br> ...statistical decision theories,<br> minimax solutions...<br> ...and compute price-cost probabilities<br> of transactions and investments...<br> ...just like we do.<br> We no longer live in a world of nations<br> and ideologies, Mr. Beale.<br> The world is a college of corporations...<br> ...inexorably determined<br> by the immutable bylaws of business.<br> The world is a business, Mr. Beale.<br> It has been since man<br> crawled out of the slime.<br> And our children will live, Mr. Beale...<br> ...to see that...<br> ...perfect world...<br> ...in which there's no war or famine...<br> ...oppression or brutality.<br> One vast and ecumenical<br> holding company...<br> ...for whom all men will work<br> to serve a common profit...<br> ...in which all men will hold<br> a share of stock...<br> ...all necessities provided...<br> ...all anxieties tranquillized...<br> ...all boredom amused.<br> And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale...<br> ...to preach this evangel.<br> Why me?<br> Because you're on television, dummy.<br> Sixty million people watch you every night<br> of the week, Monday through Friday.<br> I have seen the face of God.<br> You just might be right, Mr. Beale.<br> That evening,<br> Howard Beale went on the air...<br> ...to preach the corporate cosmology<br> of Arthur Jensen.<br> Last night I got up here<br> and asked you people...<br> ...to stand up and fight for your heritage,<br> and you did, and it was beautiful.<br> Six million telegrams were received<br> at the White House.<br> The Arab takeover of CCA<br> has been stopped.<br> The people spoke, the people won.<br> It was a radiant eruption of democracy.<br> But I think that was it, fellas.<br> That sort of thing is not likely<br> to happen again.<br> Because at the bottom<br> of all our terrified souls...<br> ...we know that democracy<br> is a dying giant...<br> ...a sick, sick, dying, decaying,<br> political concept writhing in its final pain.<br> I don't mean that the United States<br> is finished as a world power.<br> The States is the richest<br> and most powerful...<br> ...the most advanced country,<br> light years ahead of any country.<br> I don't mean the communists<br> are gonna take over the world.<br> The communists are deader than we are.<br> What is finished...<br> ...is the idea that this great country<br> is dedicated to the freedom...<br> ...and flourishing of every individual in it.<br> It's the individual that's finished.<br> It's the single, solitary, human being<br> that's finished.<br> It's every single one of you out there<br> that's finished.<br> Because this is no longer...<br> ...a nation of independent individuals.<br> It's a nation of some 200-odd million...<br> ...transistorized, deodorized...<br> ...whiter than white steel-belted bodies,<br> totally unnecessary as human beings...<br> ...and as replaceable as piston rods.<br> Well, the time has come to say...<br> ...is "dehumanization" such a bad word?<br> Whether it's good or bad,<br> that's what is so.<br> The whole world is becoming humanoid,<br> creatures that look human but aren't.<br> The whole world, not just us.<br> We're just the most advanced country,<br> so we're getting there first.<br> The whole world's people are becoming<br> mass-produced, programmed...<br> ...numbered insensate things.<br> It was a perfectly admissible argument...<br> ...that Howard Beale advanced<br> in the days that followed.<br> It was, however,<br> also a very depressing one.<br> Nobody particularly cared to hear<br> his life was utterly valueless.<br> By the end of the first week in June...<br> ...the Howard Beale Show<br> dropped one point in the ratings...<br> ...and its trend of shares dipped under 48<br> for the first time since last November.<br> You're his goddamn agent. I'm counting<br> on you to talk some sense into the lunatic.<br> Nobody wants to hear about<br> dying democracy and dehumanization.<br> I'm sorry I'm late.<br> We're starting to get rumbles<br> from the agencies.<br> Another couple of weeks<br> and the sponsors will be bailing out!<br> This is a breach of contract.<br> This isn't the Howard Beale we signed.<br> Get him off that corporate universe kick,<br> or so help me, I'll pull it off the air!<br> I told him, Lou! I've been telling him<br> every day for a week!<br> I'm sick of telling him. Now you tell him!<br> Jesus Christ.<br> You could help me out<br> with Howard if you wanted to.<br> He listens to you. You're his best friend.<br> I'm tired of all this hysteria<br> about Howard Beale.<br> Every time you come<br> from seeing somebody in your family...<br> ...you come back in one of these<br> middle-aged moods.<br> I'm tired of finding you on the telephone<br> every time I turn around.<br> I'm tired of being an accessory<br> in your life.<br> And I'm tired of pretending to write<br> this dumb book...<br> ...about my maverick days<br> in the great early years of television.<br> Every goddamned executive fired<br> from a network in the last 20 years...<br> ...has written this dumb book<br> about the great early years of television.<br> And nobody wants<br> a dumb, damn, goddamn book...<br> ...about the early days of television.<br> Terrific, Max! Maybe you can start<br> a whole new career as an actor.<br> It's the truth.<br> After living with you for six months,<br> I'm turning into one of your scripts.<br> Well, this is not a script, Diana.<br> There's some real, actual life<br> going on here.<br> I went to visit my wife today<br> because she's in a state of depression...<br> ...so depressed that my daughter flew<br> all the way from Seattle to be with her.<br> And I feel lousy about that.<br> I feel lousy about the pain<br> that I've caused my wife and my kids.<br> I feel guilty and conscience-stricken...<br> ...and all of those things<br> that you think sentimental...<br> ...but which my generation<br> calls simple, human decency.<br> And I miss my home...<br> ...because I'm beginning<br> to get scared shitless.<br> Because all of a sudden it's closer<br> to the end than it is to the beginning.<br> And death is suddenly<br> a perceptible thing to me...<br> ...with definable features.<br> You're dealing with a man<br> that has primal doubts, Diana...<br> ...and you've got to cope with it.<br> I'm not some guy discussing male<br> menopause on the Barbara Walters Show.<br> I'm the man that you presumably love.<br> I'm part of your life.<br> I live here. I'm real.<br> You can't switch to another station.<br> What exactly is it you want me to do?<br> I just want you to love me.<br> I just want you to love me,<br> primal doubts and all.<br> You understand that, don't you?<br> I don't know how to do that.<br> I'll be with you in a minute, Max.<br> By the first week in July...<br> ...the Howard Beale Show<br> was down 11 points.<br> Hysteria swept through the network.<br> He's a plague. He's smallpox.<br> He's typhoid.<br> I don't wanna follow his goddamn show.<br> I want out of that 8:00 spot.<br> I've got enough troubles<br> without Howard Beale as a lead-in!<br> Scheduled me against<br> Tony Orlando and Dawn.<br> NBC's got Little House on the Prairie.<br> ABC's got The Bionic Woman.<br> Do something! You gotta do something<br> about Howard Beale!<br> Get him off the air! Get him off!<br> Do something! Do anything!<br> We're trying to find a replacement<br> for him!<br> I'm going to look<br> at audition footage now!<br> And how when the sicks heal...<br> ...man, I tell you I saw it!<br> It was heavy, baby.<br> I saw the earth quake.<br> And I saw the moon became like blood.<br> And every mountain and island<br> was moved from its place.<br> No, no, no. Damn it.<br> If we wanted hellfire<br> we'd get Billy Graham!<br> Don't want faith healers, evangelists<br> or Oberammergau passion players!<br> What about that messiah<br> that ABC was supposed to have signed up...<br> -...as our competition for next year?<br> That's him.<br> -The bottomless pit is here.<br> That's him?<br> His ass ending.<br> Jesus. Turn him off!<br> I've got three more,<br> but you've already seen the best ones.<br> I've got a guru from Spokane<br> and two more hellfires...<br> ...who see visions of the Virgin Mary.<br> We're not gonna find a replacement for<br> Howard Beale. Let's stop kidding ourselves.<br> Fully fledged messiahs<br> don't come in bunches.<br> We either go with Howard Beale<br> or we go without him.<br> My reports say<br> we'll do better without him.<br> It would be disaster to let this situation<br> go on another week.<br> By then, he'll be down 16 points...<br> ...and the trend irreversible,<br> if it isn't already.<br> I think we should fire Howard.<br> Arthur Jensen has taken a strong personal<br> interest in the Howard Beale Show.<br> I'm having dinner with him tonight.<br> Let me have another crack at Jensen...<br> ...and then let's meet in my office<br> at 10:00 tonight.<br> Diana, give me copies<br> of all your audience research reports.<br> I may need them for Jensen.<br> Is 10:00 convenient for everyone?<br> I think the time has come<br> to re-evaluate our relationship, Max.<br> So I see.<br> I don't like the way this script of ours<br> is turning out.<br> It's turning into a seedy little drama.<br> Middle-aged man leaves wife and family<br> for young heartless woman, goes to pot.<br> The Blue Angel with Marlene Dietrich<br> and Emil Jannings. I don't like it.<br> -So you're gonna cancel the show.<br> -Right.<br> Here, let me do that.<br> The simple fact is, Max,<br> that you're a family man.<br> You like a home and kids. That's beautiful.<br> I'm incapable of any such commitment.<br> All you'll get from me is<br> a couple months of intermittent sex...<br> ...and recriminate and ugly little scenes<br> like the one we had last night.<br> I'm sorry for all those things<br> I said to you last night.<br> You're not the worst fuck I've ever had.<br> Believe me, I've had worse.<br> You don't puff or snorkle...<br> ...and make death-like rattles.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> you're rather serene in the sack.<br> Why is it that a woman always thinks...<br> ...that the most savage thing she can say<br> to a man is to impugn his cocksmanship?<br> Well, I'm sorry I impugned<br> your cocksmanship.<br> I gave up comparing genitals<br> back in the schoolyard.<br> You're being docile as hell about this.<br> Oh, hell, Diana,<br> I knew it was over with us weeks ago.<br> Will you go back to your wife?<br> I'll give it a try,<br> but I don't think she'll jump at it.<br> But don't worry about me. I'll manage.<br> I always have, I always will.<br> I'm more concerned about you.<br> You're not the boozer type.<br> So I figure a year, maybe two,<br> before you crack up.<br> Or jump out of your 14th floor<br> office window.<br> Stop selling, Max. I don't need you.<br> I don't want your pain. I don't want<br> your menopausal decay and death!<br> I don't need you, Max.<br> -Now get out of here!<br> -You need me! You need me badly.<br> Because I'm your last contact<br> with human reality.<br> I love you.<br> And that painful, decaying love<br> is the only thing between you...<br> ...and the shrieking nothingness<br> you live the rest of the day.<br> Then don't leave me.<br> It's too late, Diana.<br> There's nothing left in you<br> that I can live with.<br> You're one of Howard's humanoids...<br> ...and if I stay with you,<br> I'll be destroyed.<br> Like Howard Beale was destroyed.<br> Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed.<br> Like everything that you<br> and the institution of television touch...<br> ...is destroyed.<br> You're television incarnate, Diana.<br> Indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy.<br> All of life is reduced<br> to the common rubble of banality.<br> War, murder, death...<br> ...all the same to you<br> as bottles of beer.<br> And the daily business of life<br> is a corrupt comedy.<br> You even shatter the sensations<br> of time and space...<br> ...into split seconds and instant replays.<br> You're madness, Diana.<br> Virulent madness.<br> And everything you touch dies with you.<br> But not me.<br> Not as long<br> as I can feel pleasure and pain...<br> ...and love.<br> And it's a happy ending.<br> Wayward husband comes to his senses...<br> ...returns to his wife...<br> ...with whom he's established<br> a long and sustaining love.<br> Heartless young woman left alone<br> in her arctic desolation.<br> Music up with a swell.<br> Final commercial.<br> And here are a few scenes<br> from next week's show.<br> How did it go?<br> Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea<br> of taking Howard Beale off the air.<br> Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale<br> is bringing a very important message...<br> ...to the American people.<br> So he wants Howard Beale on the air<br> and he wants him kept on.<br> Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic<br> in our thinking.<br> I argued that television was a volatile<br> industry in which success and failure...<br> ...were determined week by week.<br> Mr. Jensen said he did not like<br> volatile industries and suggested...<br> ...with a certain sinister silkiness...<br> ...that volatility in business<br> usually reflected bad management.<br> He didn't care if Howard Beale<br> was the number-one show or the 50th.<br> He didn't really care<br> if the Beale Show lost money.<br> He wants Howard Beale on the air<br> and he wants him kept on.<br> I would describe his position on this<br> as inflexible.<br> Where does that put us, Diana?<br> That puts us in the shithouse,<br> that's where that puts us.<br> -Do you want me to go through this?<br> Yes.<br> The Beale Show Q score's down to 33.<br> Most of this loss occurred in the child<br> and teen and 18-34 categories...<br> ...which were our key core markets.<br> And as the AR department's carefully<br> considered judgment and mine...<br> ...that if we get rid of Beale,<br> we should maintain a respectable share...<br> ...in the high 20s, possibly 30,<br> with a comparable Q level.<br> The other segments of the show,<br> Sibyl the Soothsayer...<br> ...Jim Webbing, the Vox Populi,<br> have all developed their own audiences.<br> Our AR reports show<br> that it is Howard Beale...<br> ...that is the destructive force here.<br> Minimally, we're talking about<br> a 10-point differential in shares.<br> I think Joe ought<br> to spell it out for us. Joe?<br> A 28 share is 80,000-dollar minutes.<br> I think we can sell complete positions<br> on the whole.<br> We're just getting<br> into the pre-Christmas gift sellers...<br> ...and I'll tell you the agencies are coming<br> back to me with $4 CPM's.<br> If that's any indication, we're talking 40-,<br> Wanna hear the flak from the affiliates?<br> We know all about it, Herb.<br> And you would describe Mr. Jensen's<br> position on Beale as inflexible?<br> Intractable and adamantine.<br> So, what do we do<br> about this Beale son of a bitch?<br> I suppose we'll have to kill him.<br> I don't suppose you have any ideas<br> on that, Diana?<br> Well, what would you fellows say<br> to an assassination?<br> I think I can get the Mao Tse-Tung people<br> to kill Beale for us...<br> ...as one of their shows.<br> In fact, it'll make a hell of a kickoff show<br> for the season.<br> We're facing heavy opposition on the<br> other networks for Wednesday nights...<br> ...and The Mao Tse-Tung Hour<br> could use a sensational opener.<br> It could be done<br> right on camera in the studio.<br> We ought to get<br> a fantastic look-in audience...<br> ...for the assassination<br> of Howard Beale as our opening show.<br> Well, if Beale dies, what would<br> our continuing obligation...<br> ...to the Beale corporation be?<br> I know our contract with Beale<br> contains a buy-out clause...<br> ...triggered by his death or incapacity.<br> There must be a formula<br> for the computation of the purchase price.<br> Offhand, I think it was based<br> on a multiple 1975 earnings...<br> ...with the base period in 1975.<br> I think it was 50 percent of salary<br> plus 25 percent of the first year's profit...<br> ...multiplied by the unexpired portion<br> of the contract.<br> I don't think the show has<br> any substantial syndication value...<br> ...would you say, Diana?<br> Syndication profits are minimal.<br> We're talking about a capital crime here.<br> The network can't be implicated.<br> I hope you don't have any hidden<br> tape machines in this office, Frank.<br> Well, the issue is,<br> shall we kill Howard Beale or not?<br> I'd like to hear<br> some more opinions on that.<br> I don't see we have any option, Frank.<br> Let's kill the son of a bitch.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it.<br> How do you feel?<br> We're mad as hell<br> and we're not going to take this anymore!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the Network News Hour...<br> ...with Sibyl the Soothsayer.<br> Jim Webbing and his It's-the-Emes<br> Truth Department.<br> Ms. Mata Hari and her<br> Skeletons in the Closet.<br> And tonight,<br> another segment of Vox Populi.<br> And starring the Mad Prophet<br> of the Airways, Howard Beale!<br> The Network News anchorman<br> on the UBS Network News show...<br> ...known to millions as the Mad Prophet<br> of the Airways...<br> ...was shot to death tonight<br> in a fusillade of automatic-rifle fire...<br> ...just as he began<br> this evening's broadcast.<br> We never compromise,<br> so why should you?<br> Canada Dry mixers, why compromise?<br> --identified themselves as<br> the group responsible for the killing.<br> Ahmed Kahn, a massive man of well<br> over 6 feet, carrying an automatic weapon.<br> --supposed to be good for you.<br> -Did you try it?<br> I'm not gonna try it, you try it.<br> -I'm not gonna try it.<br> -Let's get Mikey.<br> Yeah. He won't eat it.<br> He hates everything.<br> The extraordinary incident...<br> ...occurred in full view<br> of his millions of viewers.<br> The assassins were members<br> of a terrorist group...<br> ...called the Ecumenical Liberation Army,<br> two of whom were apprehended.<br> The leader of the group, known<br> as the Great Ahmed Kahn, escaped.<br> This was the story of Howard Beale...<br> ...the first known instance<br> of a man who was killed...<br> ...because he had lousy ratings.<br>
