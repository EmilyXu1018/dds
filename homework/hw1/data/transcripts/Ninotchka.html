It's wonderful.<br> Let's be honest.<br> Have we anything like it in Russia?<br> No.<br> Can you imagine what the beds would be<br> in a hotel like that?<br> They tell me when you ring once,<br> the valet comes in.<br> When you ring twice, you get a waiter.<br> And do you know what happens<br> when you ring three times?<br> A maid comes in, a French maid.<br> Comrades, if we ring nine times...<br> Let's go in.<br> Just a minute.<br> I have nothing against the idea,<br> but I still say...<br> let's go back to the Hotel Terminus.<br> Moscow made our reservations there.<br> We are on an official mission...<br> and we have no right<br> to change the orders of our superiors.<br> Where is your courage,<br> Comrade Buljanoff?<br> Are you the Buljanoff<br> who fought on the barricades?<br> And now you are afraid<br> to take a room with a bath?<br> I don't want to go to Siberia.<br> And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus.<br> And I don't want to...<br> - No.<br> - Listen to me.<br> Look, Buljanoff, if Lenin were alive,<br> he would say:<br> "Buljanoff, comrade,<br> for once in your life you're in Paris.<br> "Don't be a fool.<br> Go in there and ring three times. "<br> He wouldn't say that.<br> What he would say is:<br> "You can't afford to live in a cheap hotel.<br> "Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks<br> mean anything to you?<br> "Do you want to live in a hotel...<br> "where you press for the hot water<br> and cold water comes...<br> "and when you press for cold water,<br> nothing comes at all?"<br> Phooey, Buljanoff.<br> I still say our place<br> is with the common people.<br> But who am I to contradict Lenin?<br> Let's go in.<br> - Are you the manager?<br> - Yes, monsieur.<br> Pardon me for introducing<br> Comrade Iranoff...<br> - member of the Russian Board of Trade.<br> - Monsieur.<br> - This is Comrade Kopalski.<br> - Monsieur.<br> - And I am Comrade Buljanoff.<br> - Monsieur.<br> May I ask you how much your rooms are?<br> Gentlemen, I'm afraid<br> our rates are rather high.<br> Why should you be afraid?<br> I might be able to accommodate you.<br> - Is there some more luggage?<br> - Yes.<br> But have you a safe<br> big enough to hold this?<br> I'm afraid we have no boxes<br> of that size in the vault...<br> - but there's a suite with a private safe.<br> - That's even better.<br> - But, gentlemen, I'm afraid...<br> - He's always afraid.<br> I just wanted to explain.<br> The apartment<br> may suit your convenience...<br> but I doubt whether<br> it will fit your convictions.<br> - It's the Royal Suite.<br> - The Royal Suite?<br> Just a minute.<br> Comrades, I warn you, if it gets out in<br> Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite...<br> we'll get into terrible trouble.<br> We'll tell them we had to do it<br> on account of the safe.<br> That's a perfect excuse.<br> There was no other safe big enough.<br> - That's right.<br> - That's fine.<br> Of course, we could take out the pieces...<br> and distribute them<br> in three or four boxes in the vault...<br> and take a small room.<br> - That's an idea, isn't it?<br> - Yes, that's an idea.<br> But who said we had to have an idea?<br> - That's right.<br> - That's very good.<br> - Give us the Royal Suite.<br> - Step this way, please.<br> Hello.<br> Please connect me with Mercier.<br> Yes, the jeweler.<br> Hello? No, I want to speak<br> to Monsieur Mercier personally.<br> Yes.<br> Hello, Monsieur Mercier?<br> This is Iranoff,<br> Member of the Russian Board of Trade.<br> Yes, we arrived this morning.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Yes, we have everything here.<br> The necklace, too.<br> All 14 pieces, at the... What?<br> No, Monsieur Mercier.<br> The court jewels of the Grand<br> Duchess Swana consisted of 14 pieces.<br> Why don't you check on that?<br> Of course, we have<br> all the necessary credentials.<br> Take care of the Royal Suite.<br> I'll be back in 10 minutes.<br> - All right, Rakonin.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - 8 rue de Chalon.<br> - Bien, monsieur.<br> - Hello, Leon.<br> - Good morning, Swana, darling.<br> It's really a wretched morning.<br> I can't get myself right.<br> I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle.<br> My face doesn't compose well.<br> It's all highlights.<br> How can I dim myself down, Leon?<br> Suggest something.<br> I'm so bored with this face.<br> I wish I had someone else's face.<br> Whose face would you have<br> if you had your choice?<br> I guess one gets the face one deserves.<br> There's one marvelous advantage<br> to your composition.<br> However many questions you ask,<br> you never expect an answer.<br> Don't you find that restful?<br> - Good morning, darling.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Why didn't you come last night?<br> - I was looking after your interests.<br> Did you win?<br> We can forget horse racing,<br> roulette, everything.<br> Our worries are over.<br> You remember the platinum watch<br> with the diamond numbers?<br> You'll be in a position<br> to give it to me now.<br> Darling, you're so good to me.<br> We could be rich, if you say the word.<br> - I had dinner with the Guizots last night.<br> - Those awful newspaper people.<br> You'd be surprised<br> how many nice people dine with them.<br> What a gruesome proof<br> of the power of the press.<br> I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea<br> of publishing your memoirs...<br> - in the Gazette Parisienne.<br> - What?<br> "The Life and Loves of the<br> Grand Duchess Swana of Russia. "<br> We won't have to worry about our future<br> if you're willing to raffle off your past.<br> Come in.<br> Count Rakonin asks the privilege<br> of a few words, Your Highness.<br> - Rakonin?<br> - He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil.<br> - You know him.<br> - Yes.<br> Tell him I won't be able to see him<br> for half an hour.<br> The Count says if it could be<br> as soon as possible.<br> It's luncheon time,<br> and he is between courses.<br> All right, I'll see him right away.<br> - I can't get myself right today...<br> - Count Rakonin's between courses.<br> My little Volga boatman.<br> - How do you do, my friend? Won't you sit?<br> - Your Highness.<br> - Your Highness, forgive this intrusion...<br> - Have you lost your job?<br> No, Madame.<br> Something of the utmost importance.<br> - It concerns your jewels.<br> - My jewels?<br> I remember one birthday of His Majesty,<br> our beloved Czar...<br> I had the honor of being on guard<br> at his palace.<br> I still see you bending before His Majesty.<br> You wore your diadem and a necklace.<br> But why do you bring this up now?<br> They are here. Your jewels, here in Paris.<br> Alexis, do you know what you're saying?<br> This morning, three Soviet agents arrived.<br> I overheard a telephone conversation<br> with Mercier, the jeweler.<br> - They're going to sell them.<br> - Did I hear something about jewels?<br> Rakonin has just given me<br> the most amazing news.<br> You know Count d'Algout.<br> I must call my lawyer at once.<br> - I'm sorry, Your Highness. I have to leave.<br> - I'll get in touch with you.<br> - Hello. Balzac, 2769.<br> - Au revoir, monsieur.<br> Au revoir.<br> This is the Grand Duchess Swana.<br> I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon.<br> It's very important. Get him right away.<br> Hello, Monsieur Cornillon?<br> The most incredible thing has happened.<br> My jewels are here in Paris.<br> Three Bolshevik swine<br> are trying to sell them.<br> Yes!<br> Now, we must act immediately.<br> Call the police, have them arrested.<br> Well, then get an injunction.<br> But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!<br> But they are my jewels.<br> There must be some way<br> of getting them back.<br> What does he say?<br> But how can there be a question?<br> Are you my lawyer or theirs?<br> It's all right.<br> Yes, all right, I will call you later.<br> - What did he say?<br> - They're pretty hopeless.<br> There may be a chance, that's all.<br> The French government has recognized<br> Soviet Russia...<br> and he doubts that they will risk a war<br> for my poor sake.<br> He might be able to make up some kind<br> of a case, but it would cost money.<br> Money, that's all they are interested in,<br> those lawyers.<br> Darling, calm down.<br> Why do you need a lawyer?<br> Haven't you your little Volga boatman?<br> Very good, excellent, superb.<br> It'd be foolish to belittle the quality<br> of the merchandise...<br> but your terms are impossible.<br> My counteroffer is the absolute maximum.<br> But Monsieur Mercier...<br> Gentlemen, I'm going to let you in<br> on a little secret.<br> We are undertaking this deal<br> only because of the prestige involved.<br> And, frankly,<br> we're expected to take a loss.<br> Capitalistic methods.<br> They accumulate millions<br> by taking loss after loss.<br> This is Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski.<br> Who? Count d'Algout?<br> No, that must be a mistake.<br> No, we can't be disturbed.<br> I assure you no one else can meet<br> the figure named by my syndicate.<br> At least not under<br> these economic conditions.<br> We can wait.<br> Do we give the impression of people<br> who are pressed for money?<br> Yes.<br> Gentlemen, let's put our cards<br> on the table.<br> Right now, there's<br> a Russian commission in New York...<br> trying to sell 15 Rembrandts.<br> Another in London<br> mortgaging the oil fields in Baku.<br> You need money, and quickly.<br> My offer is a very fair one, and doesn't<br> even take advantage of your situation.<br> Just a minute.<br> - Now, listen.<br> - We have just a minute.<br> - The pieces are all registered.<br> - I know. Thank you so much.<br> - He's cutting our throat.<br> - What can we do? We have to accept.<br> Comrades, don't let's give in so quickly.<br> After all, we have to uphold<br> the prestige of Russia.<br> All right, let's uphold it<br> for another 10 minutes.<br> - We don't want to be disturbed.<br> - My name is d'Algout. I telephoned.<br> If you want to see us,<br> you must come in later.<br> - Just a word with Mercier.<br> - You can't come in.<br> Monsieur Mercier, may I introduce myself?<br> I'm Leon d'Algout.<br> I had the pleasure of meeting you<br> in your beautiful shop.<br> I was admiring the platinum watch<br> with the diamond numbers.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - You remember, I...<br> Glorious, aren't they?<br> - You have no right.<br> - I did not permit you to come in here.<br> Just a moment.<br> I hope you haven't closed this deal.<br> - It may bring you serious trouble.<br> - Who are you and what do you want?<br> Those jewels belong to<br> Grand Duchess Swana...<br> and were seized illegally<br> by the Soviet government.<br> I am acting for Her Highness.<br> Here is my power of attorney.<br> You know, Monsieur Mercier,<br> this is all nonsense.<br> These may have been the jewels<br> of the Grand Duchess Swana...<br> but like all private property,<br> they were confiscated by the State.<br> We'll leave the problem of ownership<br> to the French courts.<br> Meanwhile, I have filed a petition<br> for an injunction...<br> to prohibit you from either selling<br> or removing the jewels.<br> Here is a copy.<br> If there is anything which isn't clear,<br> I shall be glad to explain it.<br> Thank you.<br> Gentlemen, this introduces<br> a new element into our negotiations.<br> - Until this claim is completely settled...<br> - We can call our ambassador.<br> I give you my word,<br> they were confiscated legally.<br> That's right.<br> Hold on, gentlemen,<br> please try to understand my position.<br> I am not withdrawing. My offer stands.<br> When you can produce a clear title<br> approved by the French courts...<br> we can close the deal.<br> Until then, gentlemen, good day.<br> I thought it my duty to warn you.<br> I should have hated...<br> - to see you in trouble.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I hope you will forgive me.<br> - I consider myself very lucky.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day, monsieur.<br> You believe me, I...<br> Gentlemen, how about a little lunch?<br> - Will you get out of here!<br> - Yes, get out.<br> But don't look so gloomy.<br> You may have a chance.<br> - We may have a chance?<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> Yes, a very slim one.<br> I want to be fair.<br> I don't deny that you might have a case.<br> We haven't anything to discuss with you.<br> We'll talk to a lawyer.<br> You talk to a lawyer and I'll talk to a judge.<br> That won't help you.<br> You can't intimidate us.<br> Soviet Russia will put<br> all its might behind this case.<br> Yes. You think because you represent<br> the former Grand Duchess...<br> - The Grand Duchess.<br> - The former Grand Duchess.<br> At any rate, gentlemen,<br> a charming, exquisite woman.<br> I warn you, if this case comes to trial,<br> it will be before a French court.<br> And when the Grand Duchess<br> takes the stand...<br> Go ahead, get her on the witness stand.<br> What can she say?<br> But how will she look?<br> The fashions this spring<br> are very becoming to her.<br> Gentlemen, the judge will be French,<br> the jury will be French...<br> everybody in the courtroom<br> will be French.<br> Have you seen a French court when<br> a beautiful woman sits on the stand...<br> and raises her skirt a little?<br> You sit down and pull up your pants<br> and where would it get you?<br> I suppose you expect us<br> to hand over the jewels?<br> No, I'm not a highwayman,<br> just a nuisance.<br> All I want to do is make things<br> as difficult as possible.<br> Not that we are giving in one inch,<br> but tell us what is in your mind?<br> Yeah.<br> - What about my proposition?<br> - What proposition?<br> I just said, let's have some lunch.<br> Hey, Sasha, Sergei, Misha.<br> What? What do you want?<br> What can we do for you?<br> That telegram from Moscow,<br> why should you bother about it?<br> - I've written it for you.<br> - Leon, Leonitchka.<br> Why are you so good to us?<br> That's very nice, boys.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> What was the name of that<br> Commissar of the Board of Trade?<br> Razinin.<br> Commissar Razinin,<br> Board of Trade, Moscow.<br> - You wouldn't like Razinin.<br> - No, he's a bad man.<br> - He sends people to Siberia.<br> - We don't like Razinin.<br> - No.<br> - We don't like him.<br> We like Leon. Don't we like Leon?<br> Yes!<br> Wait a minute.<br> Now wait a minute, how's this?<br> "Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade,<br> Moscow.

Right away, instantly.<br> Pass, please.<br> Now this is a fine thing.<br> Maybe we've missed him already.<br> How can we find somebody<br> without knowing what he looks like?<br> That must be the one.<br> Yes, he looks like a comrade.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> - No, that's not him.<br> - Positively not.<br> - What are we going to do now?<br> - I don't know.<br> We must have missed him.<br> I'm looking for<br> Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.<br> I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.<br> I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova,<br> Envoy Extraordinary...<br> acting under direct orders<br> of Comrade Commissar Razinin.<br> Present me to your colleagues.<br> - Comrade Buljanoff.<br> - Comrade.<br> - Comrade Kopalski.<br> - Comrade.<br> What a charming idea for Moscow<br> to surprise us with a lady comrade.<br> If we had known,<br> we would have greeted you with flowers.<br> Don't make an issue of my womanhood.<br> We are here for work, all of us.<br> Let's not waste any time. Shall we go?<br> Porter, here, please.<br> What do you want?<br> - May I have your bags, Madame?<br> - Why?<br> - He is a porter, he wants to carry them.<br> - Why?<br> Why should you carry other people's bags?<br> That's my business, Madame.<br> That's no business. That's social injustice.<br> That depends on the tip.<br> - Allow me, comrade.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Ticket, please.<br> - How are things in Moscow?<br> - Very good.<br> The last mass trials were a great success.<br> There are going to be fewer<br> but better Russians.<br> What's that?<br> It's a hat, comrade. A woman's hat.<br> How can such a civilization survive...<br> which permits their women<br> to put things like that on their heads?<br> It won't be long now, comrades.<br> This is the apartment we have reserved<br> for you, Comrade Yakushova.<br> I hope you like it.<br> Which part of the room is mine?<br> You see, comrade,<br> it's a little different here.<br> They don't rent rooms in pieces.<br> We had to take the whole suite.<br> - How much does this cost?<br> - 2,000 francs.<br> - A week?<br> - A day.<br> Do you know how much a cow costs,<br> Comrade Iranoff?<br> - A cow?<br> - 2,000 francs.<br> If I stay here a week,<br> I will cost the Russian people seven cows.<br> Who am I to cost the Russian people<br> seven cows?<br> We had to take it on account of the safe.<br> For ourselves, we are much happier now...<br> since we moved to a little room<br> right next to the servants' quarters.<br> I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin<br> in a room like this.<br> - Do you want to be alone, comrade?<br> - No.<br> Comrades, your telegram was received<br> with great disfavor in Moscow.<br> We did our best, comrade.<br> I hope so, for your sake.<br> Let's examine the case.<br> - What does the lawyer say?<br> - Which lawyer?<br> You didn't get legal advice?<br> We dealt directly with the representative<br> of the Grand Duchess.<br> I am sure if you call him,<br> he will give you a very clear picture.<br> I will not repeat your mistake.<br> I will have no dealings with<br> the Grand Duchess nor her representative.<br> - Comrade Buljanoff?<br> - Yes, comrade?<br> Do you spell Buljanoff<br> with one or two "F's"?<br> With two "F's," if you please.<br> Have you some cigarettes?<br> This is the Royal Suite.<br> Please send up some cigarettes. Yes.<br> You just telephone<br> and you get what you want.<br> That's the capitalistic system.<br> Comrades, I am not in a position<br> to pass final judgment.<br> But at best, you've been careless<br> in your duty to the State.<br> You were entrusted with more<br> than a mere sale of jewelry.<br> Why are we peddling our precious<br> possessions to the world at this time?<br> Our next year's crop is in danger<br> and you know it.<br> Unless we can get foreign currency<br> to buy tractors...<br> there will not be enough bread<br> for our people.<br> - And you, comrades...<br> - We did it with the best intentions.<br> We can't feed the Russian people<br> on your intentions.<br> Fifty percent to a so-called Grand Duchess.<br> Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy.<br> - Comrade Kopalski.<br> - Yes, comrade.<br> Go at once to our embassy and get me<br> the address of the best lawyer in Paris.<br> Yes, comrade.<br> Comrade Iranoff, go to the public library...<br> and get me the section<br> of the Civil Code on property.<br> - Is there anything I can do, comrade?<br> - Yes.<br> You might get me<br> an accurate map of Paris.<br> I want to use my spare time<br> to inspect public utilities...<br> and to make a study of all outstanding<br> technical achievements in the city.<br> Yes, comrade.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello. Cigarettes?<br> - Hello.<br> Comrades, you must<br> have been smoking a lot.<br> Desk.<br> Yes, Monsieur Kopalski.<br> You are expecting Count d'Algout?<br> But he is not to go to the Royal Suite<br> under any circumstances.<br> He should go to your new room, 985.<br> Thank you, monsieur.<br> You, please.<br> Me?<br> Could you give me some information?<br> Gladly.<br> How long must we wait here?<br> Well, until the policeman blows<br> his whistle again.<br> - At what intervals does he whistle?<br> - What?<br> How many minutes between<br> the first and second whistle?<br> That's very funny.<br> I never thought of that before.<br> You've never been caught<br> in a similar situation?<br> Yes, I have. Now that I come<br> to think about it, it's staggering.<br> Good heavens, if I add it up, I must<br> have spent years waiting for signals.<br> Imagine, an important part of my life<br> wasted between whistles.<br> - In other words, you don't know?<br> - No.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Can I be of any assistance to you?<br> - You might hold this for me.<br> - I'd love to.<br> Correct me if I am wrong.<br> - We are facing north, aren't we?<br> - Facing north?<br> I would hate to commit myself<br> without my compass.<br> - Pardon me, are you an explorer?<br> - No, I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.<br> Good heavens, is that thing lost again?<br> Are you interested in a view?<br> I'm interested in the Eiffel Tower<br> from a technical standpoint.<br> Technical?<br> No, I'm afraid I couldn't be of much help<br> from that angle.<br> A Parisian only goes to the Tower<br> in moments of despair to jump off.<br> How long does it take a man to land?<br> Now isn't that too bad?<br> The last time I jumped, I forgot to time it.<br> Let me see now, the Eiffel Tower...<br> Your finger, please.<br> Why do you need my finger?<br> It's bad manners to point with your own.<br> There, the Eiffel Tower.<br> And where are we?<br> Where are we? Now, let me see.<br> Here we are.<br> There you are and here am I.<br> Feel it?<br> I'm interested only in the shortest<br> distance between these two points.<br> - Must you flirt?<br> - Well, I don't have to but I find it natural.<br> - Suppress it.<br> - I'll try.<br> For my own information...<br> would you call your approach toward me<br> typical of the local morale?<br> It is that approach<br> which has made Paris what it is.<br> You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?<br> Nothing's happened recently<br> to shake my self-confidence.<br> I have heard of the arrogant male<br> in capitalistic society.<br> It is having a superior earning power<br> that makes you that way.<br> A Russian. I love Russians.<br> Comrade, I've been fascinated by<br> your Five-Year Plan for the last 15 years.<br> Your type will soon be extinct.<br> Taxi!<br> Can you tell me the exact width<br> of the foundation...<br> on which these piers are resting,<br> and the depth?<br> You don't have to worry. The thing is safe.<br> - I am not afraid...<br> - "The foundation is 141 yards square. "<br> - I hope you'll forgive me but I thought...<br> - Go on.<br> "Four massive pieces of masonry<br> are sunk to a depth of 46 feet...<br> "on the side of the Seine,<br> and 29.5 feet on the other side.<br> "The girders of interlaced ironwork,<br> which stay the structure...<br> "have an inclination of 54 degrees. "<br> - That's a strange angle.<br> - Yes, that's very strange.<br> "Ascending to the first platform<br> is a staircase consisting of...<br> "829 steps. "<br> "And an additional 254 steps<br> to the very top.<br> "There's an elevator included<br> in the price of admission. "<br> It'll take you hours to walk up there.<br> The elevator will get you up<br> in three minutes.<br> You gave me some very<br> valuable information. Thank you.<br> Thank you for getting me up here.<br> I've never seen this before.<br> - Beautiful, isn't it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.<br> Now don't misunderstand me.<br> I do not hold your frivolity against you.<br> As basic material, you may not be bad.<br> But you are the unfortunate product<br> of a doomed culture.<br> I feel very sorry for you.<br> But you must admit<br> that this doomed old civilization sparkles.<br> Look at it. It glitters.<br> I do not deny its beauty,<br> but it's a waste of electricity.<br> What a city.<br> There are the grand boulevards<br> blasted out of the heart of the old city.<br> The Arc de Triomphe,<br> built to greet Napoleon's army.<br> The Opera. Montparnasse. Montmartre.<br> And now, I'll show you<br> the greatest attraction of all.<br> It'll cost me a franc, but it's worth it.<br> The most unique spot in all Paris.<br> Really, I'm not exaggerating.<br> It's wonderful. It's charming. It's...<br> Please.<br> What do you see?<br> I see a house. Looks like any other house.<br> - What's remarkable about it?<br> - It's not the structure.<br> It's the spirit that dwells within it.<br> It has three rooms and a kitchenette<br> dedicated to hospitality.<br> - So it's your house?<br> - Let's say I live in it.<br> It's such a pleasant little place.<br> It has all the comforts.<br> Easy to reach,<br> near the subway, bus, and streetcar...<br> - Does it mean you want me to go there?<br> - Please, don't misunderstand me.<br> - Then you don't want me to go there?<br> - No.<br> I didn't say that either.<br> Nothing would please me more.<br> Then why don't we go?<br> You might be an interesting<br> subject of study.<br> I'll do my best.<br> - Good evening, Gaston.<br> - Good evening, monsieur.<br> - Is this what you call the "butler"?<br> - Yes.<br> Good evening, comrade.<br> This man is very old.<br> You shouldn't make him work.<br> He takes good care of that.<br> He looks sad. Do you whip him?<br> No, but the mere thought<br> makes my mouth water.<br> The day will come when you will be free.<br> Go to bed, little father.<br> We want to be alone.<br> Please.<br> Count d'Algout,<br> there have been several telephone calls.<br> Go to bed, little father.<br> - Now, may I offer you a drink?<br> - Thank you, I'm not thirsty.<br> Perhaps something to eat.<br> I've had all the calories<br> necessary for today.<br> Yes, all the calories.<br> What do we do now?<br> - Shall we have some music?<br> - Is that customary?<br> It helps.<br> It has ever since King David<br> wooed Bathsheba with his harp.<br> Not being so fortunate as to have<br> my harp at hand, I'll turn on the radio.<br> If there's anything you'd like to study,<br> please go ahead.<br> I've nothing to conceal.<br> This is my desk, these are my books,<br> and here am I.<br> Where shall we begin?<br> - I will start with you.<br> - Excellent.<br> Let's see, I'm 35 years old,<br> just over 6 feet tall...<br> and weigh 182 pounds, stripped.<br> What is your profession?<br> My profession?<br> Keeping my body fit,<br> keeping my mind alert...<br> and keeping the landlord appeased,<br> that's a full-time job.<br> And what do you do for mankind?<br> For mankind?<br> Yes, not so much for mankind.<br> But for womankind,<br> my record isn't quite so bleak.<br> You are something<br> we do not have in Russia.<br> Thank you. Glad you told me.<br> That's why I believe<br> in the future of my country.<br> I'm beginning to believe in it myself<br> since I've met you.<br> I still don't quite know what it's all about.<br> It confuses me, frightens me.<br> But it fascinates me.<br> Ninotchka...<br> do you like me just a little bit?<br> Your general appearance is not distasteful.<br> Thank you.<br> The whites of your eyes are clear.<br> Your cornea is excellent.<br> Your cornea is terrific.<br> Ninotchka, tell me.<br> You're so expert on things.<br> Can it be that I'm falling in love with you?<br> Why must you bring in wrong values?<br> Love is a romantic designation<br> for a most ordinary biological...<br> or shall we say "chemical," process.<br> A lot of nonsense is talked<br> and written about it.<br> I see.<br> What do you use instead?<br> I acknowledge the existence<br> of a natural impulse common to all.<br> What can I possibly do<br> to encourage such an impulse in you?<br> You don't have to do a thing.<br> Chemically, we are already<br> quite sympathetic.<br> You are the most incredible creature<br> I've ever met.<br> Ninotchka.<br> You repeat yourself.<br> Yes, I'd like to say it 1,000 times.<br> You must forgive me<br> if I seem a little old-fashioned.<br> After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.<br> It's never too late to change.<br> I used to belong<br> to the petite bourgeoisie myself.<br> No.<br> My father and mother wanted<br> me to stay and work on the farm.<br> But I preferred the bayonet.<br> The bayonet? Did you really?<br> - I was wounded before Warsaw.<br> - Wounded, how?<br> I was a sergeant<br> in the Third Cavalry Brigade.<br> Would you like to see my wound?<br> I'd love to.<br> A Polish lancer. I was 16.<br> Poor Ninotchka.<br> Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer.<br> After all, I'm still alive.<br> What kind of a girl are you, anyway?<br> Just what you see.<br> A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.<br> You're the most adorable cog<br> I've ever seen.<br> Ninotchka, let me confess something.<br> Never did I dream I could feel like this<br> toward a sergeant.<br> Do you hear that?<br> - It's 12:00.<br> - It's midnight.<br> Look at the clock. One hand has met<br> the other hand. They kiss.<br> Isn't that wonderful?<br> That's the way a clock works.<br> What's wonderful about it?<br> Ninotchka, it's midnight.<br> One half of Paris<br> is making love to the other half.<br> You merely feel you must put yourself<br> in a romantic mood...<br> to add to your exhilaration.<br> I can't possibly think of any better reason.<br> That's false sentimentality.<br> You analyze everything out of existence.<br> You'd analyze me out of existence,<br> but I won't let you.<br> Love isn't so simple, Ninotchka.<br> Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo?<br> Why do snails,<br> the coldest of all creatures...<br> circle interminably around each other?<br> Why do moths fly hundreds of miles<br> to find their mates?<br> Why do flowers slowly open their petals?<br> Ninotchka, surely you feel some<br> slight symptom of the divine passion?<br> A general warmth<br> in the palms of your hands.<br> A strange heaviness in your limbs.<br> A burning of the lips that isn't thirst...<br> but something 1,000 times more<br> tantalizing, more exalting than thirst.<br> You are very talkative.<br> Was that talkative?<br> No. That was restful.<br> Again.<br> Thank you.<br> My barbaric Ninotchka...<br> my impossible, unromantic, statistical...<br> Again.<br> - The telephone is ringing.<br> - Let it ring.<br> One of your friends may be in need of you.<br> You must answer.<br> Hello.<br> Yes. What?<br> Yes. Well, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.<br> No, I ran into an old friend from the army.<br> What?<br> The whole deal is off?<br> Are you crazy, Buljanoff?<br> A special envoy arrived.<br> I'll be glad to see her<br> whenever she wants to.<br> She doesn't want to see me?<br> What do you know about that? Why?<br> I'll get in touch with her myself.<br> What's her name?<br> Good heavens, these Russian names.<br> How do you spell it?<br> Y- A...<br> "Yakushova. "<br> Thanks.<br> Yakushova Ninotchka.<br> Yes, all right, thank you.<br> I must go.<br> Or should I say<br> "Special Envoy Yakushova"?<br> - Let's forget we ever met.<br> - No, I have a much better suggestion.<br> Let's forget the telephone ever rang.<br> I never heard that you are Yakushova.<br> You are Ninotchka, my Ninotchka.<br> I was sent here by my country<br> to fight you.<br> All right, fight me as much as you want,<br> only fight me tomorrow morning.<br> There's nothing sweeter than<br> sharing a secret with an enemy.<br> You represent White Russia<br> and I represent Red Russia.<br> Tonight let's not represent anybody<br> but ourselves.<br> It is out of the question.<br> - Lf you wish to approach me...<br> - You know I want to.<br> Then do it through my lawyer.<br> But Ninotchka,<br> you can't walk out like this.<br> I am crazy about you.<br> I thought I'd made an impression on you.<br> You liked the white of my eye.<br> I must go.<br> I held you in my arms.<br> You kissed me.<br> I kissed a Polish lancer, too...<br> before he died.<br> Yes, Marianne darling.<br> No, you didn't waken me.<br> I'm not only up, I'm on my way out.<br> Yes, I want to catch Leon<br> before he rushes out...<br> and loses himself in my business affairs.<br> Everything was going perfectly<br> until three days ago...<br> when some horrid female envoy<br> arrived from Moscow.<br> Now, we don't know where we are.<br> I'll telephone you tonight, darling.<br> Goodbye, dear.<br> I seem to remember<br> some additional injunctive provision...<br> dealing with the property of foreigners<br> residing in France.<br> You are referring to Paragraph 59B,<br> Section 25F of the Civil Code.<br> Page 824.<br> And do not fail to read the three footnotes.<br> While you are studying it, I will eat.<br> - Where to, Madame?<br> - Can you recommend a restaurant?<br> There's Grenier if you care for seafood.<br> - Where do you eat?<br> - At Pre Mathieu.<br> - Where is that?<br> - It's just a place for workmen.<br> - Where is it?<br> - Down eight blocks, rue de Provelles.<br> Thank you.<br> Are you alone, Madame?<br> A nice little corner table?<br> Or perhaps by the window<br> would be better?<br> This way, Madame.<br> I think this is the first time<br> you've been in my little place.<br> Your face is new to me.<br> Now what shall it be?<br> Raw beets and carrots.<br> Madame, this is a restaurant,<br> not a meadow.<br> Now, here's what we are offering today.<br> Please make your choice.<br> I'm sure you will find something<br> to tempt your appetite.<br> Well, for goodness' sake, hello.<br> It certainly is a small world, isn't it?<br> Well, Madame, shall we start with soup?<br> Fish soup today.<br> I got up at 5:00<br> to fish them from the Seine.<br> - Crawfish soup for me.<br> - Very well, monsieur.<br> Then may I suggest<br> an omelet with mushrooms?<br> Bring me something simple.<br> I never think about food.<br> Madame, if you don't think about food,<br> what do you think about?<br> The future of the common people.<br> That's also a question of food.<br> I will bring you a nice little lunch,<br> la Pre Mathieu.<br> May I say something?<br> You insulted him, do you know that?<br> You hurt his feelings.<br> It's just like telling a musician<br> that you don't like music.<br> That good old man believes in food<br> just as you believe in Karl Marx.<br> You can't go around hurting people<br> like that, Comrade Yakushova.<br> But you can make it up to him.<br> Do you know how?<br> By eating everything<br> that he brings you with relish...<br> by drinking everything with gusto...<br> by having a good time<br> for the first time in your natural life.<br> - I don't like you following me.<br> - I didn't follow you.<br> - How did you get here?<br> - I always eat here.<br> This is a place for working men.<br> But my dear child,<br> I am most at home among working men.<br> I hate those places where you circulate,<br> the Clarence Hotel and those places.<br> This is my natural element.<br> After all, what are any of us?<br> Working men.<br> At least, those of us<br> who are worth our salt.<br> - Hiya!<br> - Hi.<br> Hiya, boys. How's everything today?<br> - Is the lunch all right?<br> - Fine.<br> - Pay our check.<br> - Thank you, I will.<br> Great bunch of fellows.<br> My friend, I am happy to see you again.<br> I'm always glad to meet a new customer.<br> And I hope this first visit<br> will not be your last one.<br> He's just an old man. His memory is weak.<br> What are you after?<br> Must one always be after something?<br> Your tactics are useless.<br> I'm not Buljanoff, Iranoff, or Kopalski.<br> Ninotchka, why must we talk business?<br> If you win the suit, fine.<br> If we win the suit, better.<br> You do me an injustice.<br> Ninotchka, when we first went<br> to my apartment...<br> did I have the slightest idea<br> that you were connected with this deal?<br> You know now.<br> I know now that you're a man<br> who employs business methods...<br> which in Russia<br> would be punished by death.<br> Death, always so glum.<br> What about life, Ninotchka?<br> Do Russians never think about life?<br> Of the moment in which we are living?<br> The only moment we ever really have.<br> Don't take things so seriously.<br> Nothing's worth it, really.<br> Please, relax.<br> I beg you, Sergeant.<br> - Smile.<br> - What?<br> - Will you smile?<br> - Why?<br> - Well, just smile.<br> - At what?<br> At anything.<br> At the whole ridiculous spectacle of life,<br> at people being so serious...<br> taking themselves pompously,<br> exaggerating their own importance.<br> If you can't think of anything to laugh at,<br> you can laugh at us.<br> - Why?<br> - Because we're an odd couple.<br> Then you should go back to your table.<br> No, I can't leave you. I won't, not yet.<br> Not until I've made you laugh<br> at least once.<br> Now go back to your table.<br> That's not a laugh.<br> I mean a laugh from the heart.<br> I know.<br> I'm going to tell you a funny story.<br> Wait a minute, let me think of one.<br> I've got it.<br> It seems that there were two Frenchmen<br> who went to America...<br> On which boat?<br> Let's drop it.<br> I don't think you'd care very much<br> for that one anyway.<br> Probably not.<br> Here's a great one.<br> Maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it.<br> - Do you like Scotch stories?<br> - Never heard one.<br> Well, here.<br> Two Scotchmen met on the street.<br> And I don't know the name of the street.<br> It doesn't matter anyway.<br> One's name was McGillicuddy<br> and the other one's name was McIntosh.<br> McGillicuddy said to McIntosh,<br> "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy. "<br> And McGillicuddy...<br> McIntosh said to McGillicuddy:<br> "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy. "<br> Then McGillicuddy said to McIntosh,<br> "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"<br> And McIntosh said to McGillicuddy,<br> "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?"<br> I wish they'd never met.<br> So do I.<br> How is this one?<br> Two men are looking at the moon.<br> One of them says to the other:<br> "Is it true that a lot of people<br> live on the moon?"<br> The other one says,<br> "Sure it's true, about 500 million. "<br> Then the first one says:<br> "They must be pretty crowded<br> when it's half-moon. "<br> - So you don't think that's funny?<br> - No.<br> It seemed funny to me<br> when I first heard it.<br> Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke.<br> Maybe it's with you.<br> I don't think so.<br> I'll give you one more chance.<br> Here goes.<br> When I first heard this joke,<br> I laughed myself sick.<br> Here goes.<br> A man comes into a restaurant.<br> He sits down at the table<br> and he says, "Waiter...<br> "bring me a cup of coffee without cream. "<br> Five minutes later<br> the waiter comes back and says...<br> "I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream.<br> Can it be without milk?"<br> It's good, isn't it?<br> - Not funny?<br> - No.<br> Well, it is funny!<br> Everybody else thought it was funny!<br> Maybe you didn't get the point.<br> I'll tell it to you again.<br> A man comes into a restaurant.<br> - Did you get that?<br> - Yes.<br> All right.<br> He sits down at the table and he says<br> to the waiter... Did you get that?<br> - Yes.<br> - It isn't funny so far, but wait a minute.<br> He says to the waiter,<br> "Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee. "<br> Five minutes later,<br> the waiter comes and says:<br> "I'm sorry, sir, we're all out of coffee. "<br> No, you've got me all mixed up now.<br> Sits down at the table, says,<br> "Bring me a cup of coffee. " That's it.<br> He says,<br> "Bring me a cup of coffee without cream. "<br> Five minutes later,<br> the waiter comes back and says:<br> "I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream.<br> Can it be a glass of milk?"<br> You have no sense of humor!<br> None whatsoever.<br> Not a grain of humor in you.<br> There's not a laugh in you.<br> Everybody else laughs at it, but not you.<br> What's so funny about this?<br> In addition to the arguments above<br> enumerated for lifting this injunction...<br> we wish to cite the decision of the<br> High Court of Paris rendered in the case...<br> of Princess Marishka against<br> the Government of Montenegro...<br> on the fifth day of August, 1897.<br> Comparing the facts in that case<br> with our present set of facts...<br> we feel that the treaty between<br> the Republic of France and the USSR...<br> I'm sorry, gentlemen.<br> The other day I heard such a funny story,<br> it still makes me laugh.<br> It's very funny.<br> Yes, about this injunction.<br> The hearing is set<br> for the twentieth of this month.<br> That's two weeks from Thursday.<br> We did our utmost to have it set ahead.<br> I know, gentlemen.<br> It's in the hands of the court.<br> We're helpless, aren't we?<br> Yes, it is unfortunate.<br> There's nothing we can do.<br> Why get excited?<br> We'll leave these papers with you<br> for your further consideration.<br> - Au revoir, Madame.<br> - Au revoir.<br> Well, that means<br> another two weeks in Paris.<br> Too bad we have to waste all that time.<br> I acted on your suggestion...<br> and got in touch<br> with the power and light authorities.<br> Whenever you want to visit their plants,<br> they are open to you.<br> Yes, power and light. Thank you.<br> There is something else<br> which I know will appeal to you.<br> A visit to the Paris sewers.<br> They tell me it's extremely instructive.<br> Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff?<br> You all look so wintry, comrades.<br> And why do we always keep<br> the windows closed?<br> Isn't that amazing?<br> At home, there is still snow and ice,<br> and here, look at the birds.<br> I always felt a little hurt<br> when our swallows deserted us...<br> in the winter for capitalistic countries.<br> Now I know why.<br> We have the high ideal...<br> but they have the climate.<br> Comrades, I don't think<br> I need you anymore.<br> - Is there anything we can do for you?<br> - Not a thing.<br> Would you like to go out?<br> - Yes, sure.<br> - Have you any money?<br> - Here are 50 francs.<br> - Thank you.<br> Bring me back 45.<br> Yes, of course.<br> - Yes, that's fine.<br> - Goodbye, comrade.<br> - Have you the time, Gaston?<br> - It's 8:42, sir.<br> I guess it must be 8:42.<br> - You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.<br> - I am, Gaston.<br> If you'll forgive me, sir,<br> ever since you met that Bolshevik lady...<br> I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.<br> - Have you, Gaston?<br> - Decidedly.<br> Yesterday I was greatly amazed<br> when I came from the market...<br> and found you'd made your bed, sir.<br> Yes, I felt better for it all day long.<br> I felt as if I'd contributed something.<br> May I add, sir,<br> it was with great amazement...<br> that I found a copy of Karl Marx's<br> Capital on your night table, sir.<br> That is a socialistic volume,<br> which I refuse to so much as dust, sir.<br> I view with alarm the influence over you<br> of this Bolshevik lady.<br> But I don't follow you, Gaston.<br> Isn't it about time that you realized<br> the unfairness of your position?<br> Your being my servant...<br> wouldn't you like to stand<br> on an equal footing with me?<br> No, sir.<br> Good heavens,<br> isn't there any revolt in you?<br> When I order you around,<br> don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?<br> No, sir.<br> You're a reactionary.<br> You can't tell me<br> that you don't look forward to the day...<br> when you can come in here,<br> stand on your two feet...<br> and say, "From now on,<br> it's share and share alike. "<br> Emphatically not, sir.<br> The prospect terrifies me.<br> Now, don't misunderstand me, sir.<br> I don't resent your not paying me<br> for the past two months...<br> but the thought that I should split<br> my bank account with you...<br> that you should take<br> half of my life's savings...<br> that is really too much for me, sir.<br> Go to bed, little father, go to bed.<br> - I don't look too foolish?<br> - Foolish?<br> If this dress were walking down<br> the boulevard all by itself...<br> I'd follow it from one end of Paris<br> to the other.<br> And when I caught up with it, I'd say:<br> "Wait a moment,<br> you charming little dress.<br> "I want you to meet Ninotchka.<br> You two were meant for each other. "<br> Remember this room?<br> I've never been here before.<br> I wonder whom you're thinking of?<br> I know. The girl with the map...<br> always figuring out each step<br> and worrying about north and south.<br> Today...<br> Now, this might shock you.<br> I walked up to a taxi,<br> I said, "883 du Bois"...<br> and here I am.<br> You see? Life can be so simple.<br> - For 12 francs 75.<br> - 12.75? From the Clarence?<br> The son of a gun made a detour.<br> But he got you here.<br> It's 9:00.<br> That's when one half of Paris<br> says to the other half:<br> "What are you plans<br> for this evening, Madame?"<br> First, I would like to take off my hat.<br> Then, could we have some music?<br> A wonderful idea.<br> - Radio or records?<br> - Not radio.<br> Let's have music that's just for ourselves.<br> I'll play it very softly...<br> because I have things to tell you about,<br> which I can't shout.<br> Darling, I...<br> You see, I couldn't shout that.<br> Oh, Leon.<br> Leon, you know the jokes<br> you told me a few days ago?<br> I wake up in the middle of the night<br> and laugh at them.<br> You know, that's wrong.<br> They aren't funny.<br> They're silly, they're stupid.<br> And still I laugh at them.<br> And when I look at Buljanoff<br> and Iranoff and Kopalski...<br> I know they're scoundrels<br> and I should hate them.<br> Then I realize who made them like that.<br> And instead of sending my report<br> to Moscow...<br> I go down and buy a ridiculous hat.<br> And if this keeps on...<br> - Am I too talkative?<br> - No, go on.<br> And Leon, I want to tell you something<br> which I thought I would never say...<br> which I thought nobody ever should say,<br> because I didn't think it exists.<br> And, Leon, I can't say it.<br> What a gesture for a sergeant.<br> - Leon, may I ask you something?<br> - Anything.<br> If you don't want to answer, you needn't.<br> - But if you do, you must tell the truth.<br> - I promise.<br> Did you make any change in this room?<br> I don't think so.<br> When I was here before,<br> I noticed a photograph of a woman...<br> on the desk in a wide silver frame.<br> I thought, what a waste of silver.<br> That's all I was interested in then.<br> Now, I would like to know.<br> What happened to the woman?<br> The Grand Duchess?<br> She's very attractive.<br> She has great elegance.<br> She's what you call a woman of the world,<br> isn't she?<br> Ninotchka.<br> I love you.<br> I suppose she's very entertaining.<br> It must be lots of fun to be with<br> a woman like that, so witty and...<br> Ninotchka.<br> You're jealous.<br> Leon, don't ever ask me<br> for a picture of myself.<br> I couldn't bear the thought<br> of being shut up in a drawer.<br> - I couldn't breathe. I couldn't stand it.<br> - Oh, my darling.<br> Caf de Lutce.<br> A table for tonight?<br> Certainly, Count d'Algout.<br> What time, may I ask?<br> After the opera, thank you very much.<br> Good evening, Your Highness.<br> Good evening. You seem<br> to be very crowded this evening.<br> - Can you manage a table near the floor?<br> - Certainly, this way please.<br> - Count d'Algout made the reservation.<br> - Count d'Algout?<br> Yes. It is only a small table,<br> but we will put in some extra chairs.<br> No, that's another party.<br> Let's go to some other place.<br> It's so crowded here.<br> No. This is glory. At last I'm going<br> to have a look at that female Bolshevik.<br> Can we manage another table?<br> - Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.<br> - Perfect.<br> You mean Leon's bringing<br> the Bolshevik you told us about?<br> - Isn't it divine?<br> - I wouldn't have missed this for anything.<br> We must be very discreet.<br> If she sucks her soup...<br> or drinks out of her finger bowl,<br> don't laugh.<br> We mustn't embarrass poor little Leon.<br> He's gone through enough for my sake.<br> We mustn't add insult to injury.<br> Is this satisfactory, Your Highness?<br> - Is it to be dinner, Your Excellency?<br> - Later, perhaps.<br> - We'll just start with champagne.<br> - Champagne.<br> I'm only afraid the doorman may spoil<br> all our fun. If only he lets her in.<br> - Look, there's Leon.<br> - Where?<br> Good evening, Count d'Algout.<br> If you please.<br> General, shall we dance?<br> - Is it dry?<br> - Yes, monsieur.<br> - Is that right, or do you prefer it sweet?<br> - I wouldn't know.<br> The closest I ever came<br> to champagne was in a newsreel.<br> The wife of some president<br> was throwing it at a battleship.<br> It's always good luck<br> to launch something with champagne.<br> A battleship or an evening.<br> It's funny to look back.<br> I was brought up on goat's milk.<br> I had a ration of vodka in the army,<br> and now champagne.<br> From goats to grapes.<br> That's drinking in the right direction.<br> It's good.<br> From what I've read,<br> I thought champagne was a strong drink.<br> It's delicate.<br> Does anyone ever get drunk on this?<br> Well, there have been cases.<br> But the headache...<br> the next morning is worthwhile<br> if you drink it with the right toast.<br> To us, Ninotchka.<br> Thank you, General.<br> Hello, Leon! How are you, my dear?<br> - Hello, Swana. Good evening, General.<br> - How do you do?<br> You're looking magnificent tonight.<br> Isn't he, General?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Is this your new dress suit?<br> I told you Benson and Benson<br> were the tailors for you.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - It's a dream of beauty.<br> Never takes my word for anything.<br> - But I was right, wasn't I?<br> - Yes.<br> - Am I interrupting?<br> - No, not at all.<br> Your Highness,<br> may I present Comrade Yakushova?<br> How do you do?<br> - General Savitzky.<br> - How do you do?<br> I've some wonderful news about Punchy.<br> Do you mind if I sit down?<br> No, please.<br> Would you mind making my excuses<br> at our table?<br> - Certainly.<br> - Will you say I'll be back soon?<br> We can be proud of our Punchy.<br> He had a triumph at the dog show.<br> He won another blue ribbon<br> and bit the judge.<br> I bought him the loveliest little sweater<br> as a reward.<br> You should see him strutting in it.<br> He looks like a little boulevardier.<br> Count d'Algout gave me<br> Punchy for my birthday.<br> You must've searched for weeks before<br> you found anything as divine as Punchy...<br> - didn't you, Leon?<br> - Months, Swana.<br> Poor Madame Yakushova.<br> Here we are talking in mysteries.<br> - I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.<br> - Not at all.<br> I understand perfectly.<br> Count d'Algout gave you a dog.<br> You made it very clear, Madame.<br> Oh, dear me. I must be losing my finesse.<br> If I'm not careful,<br> I'll be understood by everybody.<br> - Charming crowd here tonight, isn't it?<br> - I'm going, Leon.<br> But before I go, I must compliment you<br> on your gown, Madame Yakushova.<br> Is that what they're wearing<br> in Moscow this year?<br> No, last year, Madame.<br> Isn't it amazing? One gets<br> the wrong impression of the new Russia.<br> It must be charming. I'm delighted<br> conditions have improved so.<br> I assume this is what the factory workers<br> wear at their dances?<br> Exactly. It would have been<br> very embarrassing for people of my sort...<br> to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia.<br> The lashes of the Cossacks<br> across our backs were not very becoming.<br> And you know how vain women are.<br> Yes, you're quite right about the Cossacks.<br> We made a great mistake<br> when we let them use their whips.<br> They had such reliable guns.<br> Will you do me a favor?<br> Let's not talk about the good old days.<br> Yes, it's a very wise suggestion.<br> I'm afraid Madame and I will never agree.<br> The only thing we have<br> in common is our lawsuit...<br> and that will be settled next week.<br> I understand everything<br> will be over by Thursday.<br> Am I right?<br> Yes. You're right, Madame.<br> It'll all be over by Thursday.<br> It's too bad you have<br> so few more days here in Paris.<br> Leon, be sure and redouble your efforts...<br> so Madame can take some pleasant<br> memories when she returns to Moscow.<br> - Good night, Leon.<br> - Good night, Swana.<br> Now I think I need a glass of champagne.<br> Quickly, please tell me<br> one of your funny stories.<br> A funny story?<br> You never finished the one<br> about the two Scotchmen with the names.<br> Please.<br> Well, there were two Scotchmen.<br> One's name was McIntosh<br> and the other one was McGillicuddy.<br> They met on the street.<br> No, I'll tell you another story.<br> A much better one.<br> The only thing that'll be over<br> on Thursday will be the lawsuit.<br> There will be no Thursday for us.<br> Next week or any other week.<br> I won't let it happen.<br> I'll tear it out of the calendar.<br> Isn't that a good story?<br> Wonderful, if one could believe it.<br> You must, darling.<br> To the loveliest story I ever heard.<br> Let's dance.<br> Leon, something is the matter.<br> You just made that trip<br> from goats to grapes a little too quickly.<br> Everything is so wonderful.<br> It's getting farther and farther away.<br> - What, darling?<br> - Thursday.<br> Yes, don't worry,<br> everything's going to be all right.<br> Comrades!<br> Darling, please.<br> I want to talk to my brothers.<br> Don't shush me, please. I am the people.<br> I want to hold a speech.<br> - I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess.<br> - You can't do that.<br> Oh, comrades! The good people of France!<br> - Now, Ninotchka.<br> - But they're all grand duchesses here.<br> I ordered out thousands of<br> grand duchesses and I want to tell them.<br> Yes, dear, you're quite right. But first,<br> you're going through that door.<br> You're going to lie down<br> and take some spirits of ammonia.<br> - No speech?<br> - No speech.<br> I love you, my little Leonitchka.<br> And I adore you, Ninotchka.<br> Go ahead, now.<br> - No speech?<br> - No. For heaven's sake, no speech.<br> - Give me a double brandy.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm sorry, Count, it is most embarrassing,<br> but the lady you brought with you...<br> is spreading communistic propaganda<br> in the powder room.<br> What? Give me another double brandy.<br> That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere,<br> but inciting the attendants...<br> of the powder room to go on strike?<br> If she succeeds,<br> the consequences will be disastrous.<br> What can I do about it?<br> She has been asked to leave<br> the powder room, but without success.<br> We would appreciate it very much<br> if you would see to it yourself.<br> - You want me to go in there?<br> - I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.<br> - Make it a triple brandy.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All right, tell the Grand Duchess.<br> Tell everybody.<br> They know it anyway.<br> It doesn't make any difference. Get out.<br> - Don't tell them where we're going.<br> - No, darling, nobody will find us.<br> - Are we going to build our little house?<br> - Yes, a little white house.<br> - No, not white.<br> - All right, we'll make it red.<br> No, let's not have any color. No color.<br> Just a "house" house.<br> - Let's form our own party.<br> - Right.<br> Lovers of the world, unite.<br> - And we won't stretch up our arms.<br> - No!<br> - And we won't clench our fists.<br> - No.<br> - Our salute will be a kiss.<br> - Yes.<br> A kiss. Salute.<br> I am so happy.<br> No one can be so happy<br> without being punished.<br> I will be punished,<br> and I should be punished.<br> - Leon, I want to confess.<br> - I know. It's the Russian soul.<br> Well, everyone wants to confess.<br> And if they don't confess,<br> they make them confess.<br> I am a traitor.<br> When I kissed you,<br> I betrayed a Russian ideal.<br> I should be stood up against the wall.<br> - Would that make you any happier?<br> - Much happier.<br> All right.<br> I've paid the penalty.<br> Now, let's have some music.<br> - Yes, let's turn on the radio.<br> - Radio? What's radio?<br> Radio's a little box that you buy<br> on the installment plan...<br> and before you tune it in,<br> they tell you there's a new model out.<br> Yes, I know where that is.<br> There's one around here somewhere.<br> It has a little knob that you turn.<br> - A little knob, that's right.<br> - Yeah. Maybe it's in here.<br> - Just a little knob.<br> - It's a radio and has a knob.<br> Now, maybe it's in here.<br> Let's see. There it is.<br> - There's the knob.<br> - There's the knob.<br> Now, what shall we get, the news?<br> No news. We don't want to know<br> what's happening in the world.<br> We want to be left alone, don't we?<br> Yes, darling, all by ourselves.<br> Then turn to the left and stop at seven.<br> Turn to the left and stop at seven.<br> - No music.<br> - No music.<br> There it is, Thursday.<br> You can't rip it out of the week.<br> There they are.<br> - They're terrible things, those jewels.<br> - But big.<br> They are the tears of Old Russia.<br> - See that stone?<br> - Who cried that one?<br> Czar Peter gave it to his wife,<br> Catherine the Great.<br> For it he sold 10,000 serfs in the market.<br> But, darling, don't get impatient.<br> Wait till we're married.<br> You know that worthless butler of mine,<br> that reactionary?<br> Some day I'll come home<br> to you and I'll say:<br> "Darling, I drove Gaston<br> to the market this morning...<br> "and look what I got for him. "<br> Darling, come here.<br> Let me put this on you.<br> - No.<br> - Yes, you will teach these jewels.<br> For the first time,<br> they will learn how they can really look.<br> They belong to the people.<br> And I give them back to the people.<br> I make you Ninotchka the Great...<br> Duchess of the People...<br> Grand Duchess of the People.<br> - Is this the wish of the masses?<br> - It is their wish.<br> Thank you, Leon. Thank you, masses.<br> - Can I make a speech now?<br> - Please.<br> Comrades, people of the world.<br> The revolution is on the march. I know.<br> Bombs will fall, civilization will crumble...<br> but not yet, please.<br> Wait. What's the hurry?<br> Give us our moment. Let's be happy.<br> - We're happy, aren't we, Leon?<br> - Yes, darling.<br> So happy and so tired.<br> Smile, little father. Smile.<br> Come in.<br> - Good morning.<br> - What?<br> It's tomorrow morning. Tomorrow noon,<br> to be exact. I hope you'll forgive me.<br> I know it's extremely cruel<br> to awaken anyone at such an hour.<br> Don't you recognize me?<br> I'm the Grand Duchess Swana.<br> I know exactly how you feel, my dear.<br> The morning after always does look grim...<br> if you happen to be wearing<br> last night's dress.<br> Don't be embarrassed<br> by my presence, though.<br> You couldn't have found anyone<br> more sympathetic to your condition.<br> I think we can cut your visit short.<br> - Leon is not here.<br> - Of course not, my dear.<br> I didn't come here<br> with any such suspicion. How ridiculous.<br> Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.<br> What is it you people always say,<br> regardless of what you mean?<br> "I'm delighted to have you here. "<br> I haven't reached that state of civilization,<br> therefore I must ask you to leave.<br> Leave? That's exactly what I came here<br> to ask you to do. Leave.<br> I don't mean this hotel,<br> and I don't mean Paris. I mean France.<br> There's a plane for Moscow at 5:40.<br> Do you still think you're issuing orders<br> from your palace in Petrograd?<br> My palace in Petrograd.<br> Yes, you took that away from me.<br> You took away my czar,<br> my country, my people.<br> Everything I had. But nothing more.<br> People cannot be taken away, Madame...<br> neither 160 million nor one.<br> Not if you have their love. You hadn't.<br> That's why you're not in Russia<br> any longer...<br> and that's why you came here<br> this morning.<br> Problems were never solved<br> by bowing from a balcony.<br> My dear, you don't know how<br> impressive I could be.<br> Did you ever see me in my regalia<br> with my diadem and all my jewels?<br> Elyse 2763.<br> Believe me, Leon can't help you.<br> He doesn't know anything<br> about the jewels.<br> I give you my word. I swear it.<br> Where are they?<br> You were very careless<br> with our precious jewels, my dear.<br> They're too expensive a toy<br> for two children to play with.<br> Where are they?<br> Don't worry, last night a very trustworthy<br> friend kept his eyes open.<br> He may have overstepped<br> his function as a waiter...<br> but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.<br> I just put this on for sentiment.<br> The rest are absolutely safe, I assure you.<br> - But if you feel like notifying the police...<br> - You leave me no choice.<br> Won't it be rather embarrassing<br> for a Soviet envoy...<br> to disclose the circumstances<br> under which she lost them?<br> I'll have to face the consequences,<br> but so will you.<br> Don't forget,<br> they'll ask you how you got them.<br> That's very simple to answer.<br> They were given to me by my mother.<br> They were given to her by her mother.<br> In fact, they're mine.<br> You can't steal what belongs to you.<br> They always belonged<br> to the Russian people.<br> They paid for them with their blood,<br> their lives, and you'll give them back.<br> I told you we had plenty to talk about.<br> Shall we sit down?<br> Let's free ourselves from emotionalism...<br> and try to solve the problem<br> in a practical way.<br> Our situation has considerably changed.<br> Before I had only a claim to the jewels.<br> Now I have the jewels.<br> In other words,<br> moral ideas have no weight with you.<br> All right, then let's deal with legal facts.<br> You know...<br> - France has recognized the Soviet.<br> - Unfortunately.<br> Under the Soviet law,<br> the jewels belong to the State.<br> - France is going to uphold that ownership.<br> - Yes, my lawyer agrees with you.<br> He says that France will uphold it<br> in every court...<br> but I will drag you through every court,<br> don't forget that.<br> And when I say it will take two years...<br> I am, as always, conservative.<br> Won't those two years in court<br> be expensive for you?<br> I know money was no object...<br> as long as you could squeeze it out of<br> the pockets of the people.<br> I may run out of money,<br> but you have already run out of bread.<br> Two years is a long time<br> for your comrades to wait.<br> I see. You've calculated it<br> in terms of hunger.<br> No, I just wanted<br> to be absolutely impartial.<br> Both of us are faced<br> with two rather uncomfortable years.<br> We can condense those two years<br> to two minutes...<br> - if you want to accept my proposition.<br> - Go on.<br> I am willing to hand over the jewels<br> and sign any necessary papers...<br> if you will take that 5:40 plane to Moscow.<br> That's not the way to win him back.<br> Not Leon.<br> I think I know Leon quite as well as you.<br> Perhaps a little better.<br> Leave that worry to me.<br> Now, 5:40 leaves you time enough<br> to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier...<br> but naturally you'll...<br> be too busy for any farewells.<br> I will see to it that everything is done<br> in the most expeditious manner.<br> And I will also see you to the airport.<br> That's my proposition,<br> Comrade Yakushova.<br> Yes? Hello.<br> Yes, Leon.<br> No, you didn't waken me.<br> I'm fine, thank you.<br> Yes, it was wonderful.<br> For luncheon?<br> I'm afraid I can't. I have lots of things<br> to attend to today, Leon.<br> I'm going to be very busy.<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I'm a little tired and I would like to rest.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Perhaps it is the champagne.<br> For dinner?<br> Of course, 7:00 here.<br> Come in. Yes.<br> Just a moment.<br> - You can leave it here.<br> - Yes, Madame.<br> Operator, will you switch the call, please?<br> Darling, your present just arrived.<br> It's very silly and very wonderful.<br> What?<br> I won't forget. 7:00.<br> Goodbye, darling.<br> What?<br> Salute.<br> - Good afternoon, Jacqueline.<br> - Good afternoon, Your Highness.<br> - Madame, I...<br> - Yes, I know.<br> You didn't find my other glove.<br> It's all right. You're forgiven.<br> Thank you, Your Highness.<br> Count d'Algout is waiting.<br> He's been here for some time.<br> Count d'Algout? Yes.<br> Leon, darling. How nice.<br> - Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?<br> - No, thanks, Swana.<br> Did I act stupidly last night?<br> Should I apologize?<br> No. I'm the one who should apologize.<br> I should have talked to you before.<br> Is this, by any chance,<br> going to be a confession?<br> - Yes.<br> - No, my little Volga boatman.<br> Have you forgotten<br> our First Commandment?<br> Never complain, never explain.<br> It's worked so often and so perfectly<br> in the past, let's not break the rule.<br> Please don't look so guilty. Otherwise, I...<br> Swana, just this once,<br> I must ask you to listen to me.<br> All right.<br> - I'm listening.<br> - I know you hate the obvious.<br> But do you mind if,<br> for the moment, I'm not the least subtle?<br> Brutal frankness, if you insist.<br> There are 100 ways of approaching it...<br> but I feel it can best be said<br> in one simple phrase.<br> I'm in love, Swana.<br> I thought it was something serious.<br> How could you frighten me so?<br> It must be serious.<br> Not so long ago I'd have considered<br> such a statement juvenile...<br> and rather middle-class.<br> Now I can say it without a stammer,<br> without a blush.<br> I'm in love, Swana.<br> But, Leon, this has the ugly<br> sound of regeneration.<br> - I'm afraid that's what it is, Swana.<br> - Always late.<br> Same old trouble, Leon.<br> Whether you take me to the opera...<br> or call for me at a beauty shop,<br> you're never on time.<br> Now, when it's a question of your reform,<br> late again by about five minutes.<br> - What is this, Swana?<br> - Knowing the efficiency...<br> of the French air service,<br> I think I can safely guarantee...<br> that Madame Yakushova<br> has taken off for Moscow.<br> - Has done what?<br> - She's gone, Leon.<br> - You don't expect me to believe that?<br> - There's the telephone.<br> If you call the hotel,<br> you'll find you have no 7:00 appointment.<br> Imagine. For once in our lives<br> we were in Paris...<br> - and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.<br> - That's right.<br> They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant<br> on the second floor.<br> Yes, it is an amazing piece<br> of engineering...<br> still the most remarkable<br> iron structure in the world.<br> Leading to the top...<br> there is a staircase of over 1,000 steps...<br> but there is an elevator included<br> in the price of admission.<br> Everything's in order,<br> I hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia.<br> Thank you. By the way,<br> I've heard so many rumors...<br> about laundry conditions in Russia.<br> Is it advisable to take one's own towels?<br> Certainly not.<br> That is only capitalistic propaganda.<br> - We change the towel every week.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hello. Comrade Cazabine?<br> No, I am sorry.<br> He hasn't been with us for six months.<br> He was called back to Russia<br> and was investigated.<br> You can get further details<br> from his widow. You're very welcome.<br> Pardon me. I was interested<br> in what you were saying.<br> When an envoy goes back to Russia<br> and they don't like what he's done...<br> they put him out of the way?<br> Not always.<br> Look at me. I've been back twice.<br> Here's my passport. Please give me a visa.<br> - I must leave for Russia immediately.<br> - Count Leon d'Algout. A count.<br> - A nobleman.<br> - Don't hold that against me, please.<br> Why should an aristocrat<br> want to go to Russia?<br> - Business.<br> - What business?<br> - Private.<br> - There is no private business in Russia.<br> This whole thing seems very suspicious.<br> What is the real reason?<br> If you ever want to get into Russia,<br> take my advice. Confess.<br> Listen. I'll be absolutely frank with you.<br> - I have no business in Moscow.<br> - I think so, too.<br> I want to see a friend of mine,<br> a very dear friend.<br> It's a personal matter that has no relation<br> to social philosophies or politics.<br> - It's a girl.<br> - It is love which drags you to Moscow.<br> - Yes.<br> - No visa.<br> - But I must get into that country of yours.<br> - No visa.<br> But that's impossible. You can't do it!<br> You haven't the right to...<br> - Listen. If you don't give me that visa...<br> - You're going to force us?<br> You advertise all over the world<br> for people to go into your country...<br> and when somebody tries,<br> you won't let them!<br> - Why should I take a chance?<br> - On what?<br> How do I know you don't want<br> to blow up a factory?<br> - What for? Why?<br> - Or a tunnel, or a bridge?<br> Nothing but suspicions.<br> That's the trouble with you.<br> Listen, if you don't let me in,<br> I'll stand in front of this office of yours...<br> and warn people<br> to keep away from Russia.<br> I'll picket your whole country.<br> I'll boycott you, that's what I'll do.<br> No more vodka, no more caviar,<br> no more Tchaikovsky, no more borscht!<br> - Wait a minute. I've got a better idea.<br> - What?<br> You can tell the Kremlin<br> that's just the beginning!<br> No visa.<br> March!<br> Comrades of the world...<br> never has there been<br> such a May Day parade as this.<br> - Good afternoon, Anna.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Aren't you late?<br> No. The opera starts an hour later tonight<br> on account of the parade.<br> - Didn't you march today?<br> - They didn't let me. I'm in disgrace.<br> Last week, at the performance<br> of Carmen, I played a sour note.<br> The conductor got so excited, he yelled:<br> "There is sabotage in the string section!"<br> Too bad, Anna.<br> You missed an inspiring day.<br> Yes, I know. Are you expecting someone?<br> - A few friends. Just a small dinner party.<br> - And what are you serving?<br> - An omelet.<br> - An omelet?<br> Aren't you living a little above your ration?<br> I saved two eggs...<br> and each of my friends is bringing his own.<br> We'll manage.<br> Just goes to prove the theory of our State.<br> If you stand alone, it means a boiled egg...<br> but if you're true to the collective spirit<br> and stick together, you've got an omelet.<br> That reminds me. Have you heard the<br> latest they're telling about the Kremlin?<br> Well, one man... I'll tell you later.<br> That Gurganov.<br> You never know whether he's on his way<br> to the washroom, or the Secret Police.<br> - You should be more careful.<br> - And you, too, Ninotchka.<br> - About what?<br> - Ever since you've been back from Paris...<br> I haven't talked to anyone about Paris.<br> I haven't said a word.<br> That's just it. It makes people feel queer.<br> And I don't want you to get in any trouble.<br> - I have nothing to hide.<br> - You should. I'll show you.<br> When I passed through<br> the laundry yard today...<br> I saw all the women huddled around this,<br> so I brought it up here.<br> Things like this create a bad feeling.<br> First they didn't know whose it was...<br> and then they saw the Paris label<br> and did it start a commotion.<br> Some said it's what we all ought to wear.<br> Others said it's like hanging foreign ideas<br> on our clothesline.<br> - It undermines our whole cause.<br> - I see.<br> You know how it is today.<br> All you have to do is wear...<br> a pair of silk stockings, and they<br> suspect you of counter-revolution.<br> Thank you, Anna.<br> I'll dry it up here when I wash it next.<br> I should hate to see our country<br> endangered by my underwear.<br> Ninotchka, I'm your friend.<br> You can trust me.<br> - Did you bring back anything else?<br> - No.<br> I left everything in Paris.<br> I just happened to be wearing this.<br> Tell me, what else did you have?<br> Well, a hat.<br> What was it like?<br> Oh, it was very silly.<br> I'd be ashamed to wear it here.<br> As beautiful as that.<br> What else? Come, tell me.<br> - An evening gown.<br> - An evening gown?<br> Yes, it's a dress you wear in the evening.<br> What do you wear in the morning?<br> When you get up you wear a negligee,<br> then you change into a morning frock.<br> You mean to tell me you wear a different<br> dress for different times of the day?<br> - Yes.<br> - Now, Ninotchka, you are exaggerating.<br> No, it's true.<br> That's how they live in the other world.<br> Here we dress to cover up our bodies.<br> To keep warm.<br> And there?<br> Sometimes they're not<br> completely covered, but they don't freeze.<br> They must have wonderful materials<br> to make a thing like this.<br> So soft.<br> - Something you don't even see.<br> - You feel it, though.<br> Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up<br> if we weren't such good friends.<br> What is it, Anna?<br> You know I told you that Pavlov and I<br> are going to get married...<br> when he comes back from the maneuvers.<br> Would it be asking too much if...<br> - You want this?<br> - Just for the honeymoon.<br> - It's yours for good.<br> - Ninotchka.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> I'll never forget what you've done.<br> Am I going to play that cadenza tonight!<br> ... individuals, yes.<br> As atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia.<br> ... and 30 million peasants,<br> 85% of the population...<br> ... into an automobile<br> and the muzhik into a tractor...<br> and then let the capitalists try to keep...<br> No music.<br> Ninotchka.<br> Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski!<br> How are you, you three scoundrels?<br> Well, we are back home.<br> You know what they say,<br> there is nothing like home.<br> Yes, and we might as well face it.<br> Now, you mustn't talk that way,<br> you must adjust yourselves.<br> - Let's be brave.<br> - Brave, that's right.<br> - Come and sit down.<br> - Let's be happy that we are all alive.<br> That we owe to Ninotchka.<br> If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin<br> such a wonderful report about us...<br> - who knows what would've happened?<br> - I can tell you exactly.<br> Let's forget everything,<br> except we're together.<br> - Yes, let's do that.<br> - It's a real Paris reunion.<br> If you close your eyes and listen<br> to our voices, we might be in Paris.<br> Let's not close our eyes. There are many<br> good things to see here, too.<br> Look how nicely<br> she has arranged the table.<br> Yes, how lovely. And what a<br> wonderful room you have here.<br> - How many families live here with you?<br> - Only myself and two other girls.<br> A cello player in the opera,<br> and a streetcar conductor.<br> Just three people in a room this size?<br> Buljanoff, look here.<br> - Isn't that wonderful?<br> - Look at this.<br> - What good material.<br> - Naturally, it's not the Royal Suite.<br> Comrades, once and for all,<br> we are in Moscow.<br> Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just look<br> out of the window and there it is.<br> And it's great.<br> Think what it was a few years ago<br> and what it is now.<br> It's a tremendous achievement.<br> - You must be reasonable, comrades.<br> - She is right.<br> Anyhow, let's talk ourselves into it.<br> All right. It's great.<br> It's marvelous. It's wonderful.<br> Just see how happy the people look<br> from here.<br> Can you blame them?<br> At least the May Day parade is over.<br> That's another thing. It's spring.<br> The same spring we had in Paris.<br> Just as good.<br> - Even the swallows are back.<br> - Really?<br> Yes, that's right. Maybe it's<br> the same swallow we saw in Paris.<br> Yes, it is, Ninotchka. It is.<br> He must have been in Paris.<br> You can see it in his whole attitude.<br> He picked up a crumb of our black bread,<br> shook his head and dropped it.<br> We must be patient.<br> Finally we got the spring, didn't we?<br> Let's forget the future.<br> Let's stop being sentimental.<br> - Let's start that omelet.<br> - That's right.<br> - Here is my egg.<br> - And here is mine.<br> And here are mine.<br> I don't know where's my egg?<br> I had an egg, too.<br> Comrades, I am out of the omelet.<br> - Don't worry, there'll be enough.<br> - Of course, comrade.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Now come over here.<br> Come, Ninotchka,<br> let's make it in real Parisian style.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Let's fill it with confiture des prunes.<br> A man like that.<br> All he has to do is walk through a room<br> and the omelet drops.<br> Yes.<br> Comrade Yakushova, here,<br> the postman left this letter for you.<br> Thank you, Vladimir.<br> - What is it, Ninotchka?<br> - Ninotchka, what is it?<br> - It's from Paris.<br> - From Paris?<br> - A bill?<br> - From Leon.<br> - From Leon?<br> - How is he, tell us?<br> Bad news?<br> Well, I think it's getting late.<br> Good night, Ninotchka.<br> Thanks for a wonderful dinner.<br> - Good night, Ninotchka.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night.<br> They can't censor our memories, can they?<br> No.<br> Come in.<br> - Good morning, comrade.<br> - Good morning, Comrade Commissar.<br> Here's my report on materials available<br> for trading in the next four months.<br> Does it include products<br> of the far eastern provinces?<br> - Yes, it does.<br> - You've finished the whole investigation?<br> That's marvelous.<br> You must have worked day and night.<br> - Don't you ever sleep?<br> - I need very little sleep.<br> We must be extremely careful<br> what goods we take in exchange.<br> I have already started a survey<br> on our most urgent needs.<br> Comrade, I am afraid you will have<br> to turn over that work to someone else.<br> May I ask why?<br> - Please sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> Now, comrade, have you heard<br> from Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?<br> - No.<br> - I haven't either...<br> but I have heard about them.<br> You must realize...<br> it was on the strength of your Paris report<br> that I sent them to Constantinople.<br> Without that,<br> I never would have trusted them...<br> on a mission as important as a fur deal.<br> May I ask what has happened?<br> If I told you what's going on<br> in Constantinople right now...<br> you wouldn't believe it.<br> They are sitting there, those three,<br> for six weeks...<br> and haven't sold a piece of fur.<br> This anonymous report was sent to me.<br> They are dragging the good name of our<br> country through every caf and nightclub.<br> Here. "How can the Bolshevik cause<br> gain respect among the Moslems...<br> "if your three representatives, Buljanoff,<br> Iranoff, and Kopalski get so drunk...<br> "that they throw a carpet<br> out of their hotel window...<br> "and complain to the management<br> that it didn't fly. "<br> Unbelievable! It's an outrage.<br> They shouldn't do such things.<br> Are you sure this report's correct?<br> Naturally, I want to verify it,<br> and that's why I need you.<br> - You want me to go to Constantinople?<br> - Yes, leaving immediately.<br> I appreciate your confidence in me...<br> but I must ask you<br> to entrust someone else with this mission.<br> I should hate<br> to interrupt my present work.<br> I am positive my survey<br> is more important...<br> than finding out whether<br> three of our comrades have been...<br> drinking some extra glasses<br> of champagne.<br> That is for me to decide,<br> Comrade Yakushova.<br> I am sorry. I don't want<br> to overstep my position...<br> but please don't send me.<br> Please, comrade, let me stay here.<br> Let me finish my work.<br> I'm in the rhythm of it now.<br> I don't want to go away.<br> I don't want to be sent<br> into that foreign atmosphere again.<br> It throws you out of gear.<br> Let me finish my work.<br> I have concentrated everything in it.<br> Please don't make me go.<br> Don't waste my time, comrade.<br> Do your duty. Goodbye.<br> I shall do my best.<br> How do you like it, Ninotchka?<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> - Tell us, Ninotchka.<br> - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...<br> Now, please don't start<br> figuring it out in cows.<br> You've done it again, and I'm responsible.<br> How can you forget yourselves this way?<br> You were sent here to make money<br> not to spend it.<br> Buljanoff, she still has those<br> old-fashioned ideas.<br> - It is high time she got out of Russia.<br> - Comrades.<br> - I must be stern with you.<br> - That's our old Ninotchka.<br> Don't forget the day will come<br> when you will have to face Razinin.<br> Ninotchka! Razinin?<br> Good old Razinin. Is he still alive?<br> How does he manage?<br> - Comrades...<br> - Friends, Ninotchka, we are friends.<br> Imagine, we don't have<br> to whisper any more.<br> No. We can say whatever we want.<br> We can shout, we can complain. Look.<br> The service in this hotel is terrible!<br> See? Nobody comes,<br> nobody pays any attention.<br> - That's freedom.<br> - That's bad management.<br> Is it possible to bring you back to reality<br> for one moment?<br> I must have a complete report<br> of your negotiations...<br> - and a detailed expense account.<br> - No, don't ask for it.<br> There is a Turkish proverb which says:<br> "If something smells bad,<br> why put your nose in it?"<br> And there is an old Russian saying:<br> "The cat who has cream on his whiskers<br> had better find good excuses. "<br> With our cream situation as it is...<br> it's Russia that should apologize<br> to the cats.<br> I don't know how I can<br> get you out of it this time.<br> How will it end?<br> - Shall we tell her?<br> - Yes.<br> - Ninotchka, I hope you'll be our guest.<br> - Guest?<br> - Yes, we have opened a restaurant.<br> - A restaurant?<br> We have a wonderful electric sign:<br> "Dine with Buljanoff, Iranoff,<br> and Kopalski. "<br> You mean you're deserting Russia?<br> Ninotchka, don't call it desertion.<br> Our little restaurant, that is our Russia.<br> The Russia of borscht,<br> the Russia of beef stroganoff.<br> - Of blinis and sour cream.<br> - The Russia of pirozhki.<br> - People will eat and love it.<br> - We are not only serving good food...<br> we are serving our country.<br> We are making friends.<br> Who gave you this idea?<br> Who's responsible for all this?<br> There is something in Constantinople,<br> something irresistible.<br> It's in the air.<br> It may come around the corner...<br> - when you walk down the street.<br> - It may step out of a bazaar.<br> It may be waiting for you in a corridor.<br> It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.<br> And right now it's on the balcony.<br> They wouldn't let me in,<br> so I had to get you out.<br> So you're behind all this.<br> I should have known.<br> Trying to keep me away from you.<br> As though that were possible.<br> Naturally, I couldn't go on forever<br> punching passport officials in the nose...<br> but I found a way, didn't I?<br> Darling, I had to see you.<br> I wrote and wrote.<br> And all my letters came back to me.<br> And the one I got,<br> they wouldn't let me read.<br> It began, "Ninotchka, my darling"...<br> and it ended "Yours, Leon. "<br> I won't tell you what came between.<br> I'll show you, I'll prove it.<br> But it'll take a long time, Ninotchka.<br> At least a lifetime.<br> But, Leon, I'm only here for a few days.<br> All right, if you don't stay with me,<br> then I'll have to continue my fight.<br> I'll travel wherever<br> there are Russian commissions.<br> I'll turn them all into Iranoffs,<br> Buljanoffs, and Kopalskis.<br> The world will be crowded<br> with Russian restaurants.<br> I'll depopulate Russia.<br> Comrade, once you saved<br> your country by going back.<br> This time you can only save it<br> by staying here.<br> Well, if it is a choice between<br> my personal interest...<br> and the good of my country,<br> how can I waver?<br> No one shall say Ninotchka<br> was a bad Russian.<br> Darling.<br> SkyFury<br>
