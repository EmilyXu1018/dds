Sit down.<br> Sure, you've got|a great product...<br> ...but you have to remember what|you're really selling yourself.<br> So it's not necessarily|what I say as how I say it?<br> That's right, Earl.|A good salesman can sell anything.<br> And I remember when|you were a good salesman...<br> ...at the beginning.<br> But something|seems to have changed now.<br> Now, I don't want to pry,|but is everything all right at home?<br> Everything's all right|with Margie, right?<br> Will there be anything else, gentlemen?|Leave it.<br> Just leave it.|Yes, sir. Thank you.<br> Thanks.|I watched you...<br> ...walking back and forth in front|of my desk in an agitated manner...<br> ...smoking a cigarette without having asked|if you could smoke in my presence...<br> Okay, listen up.

Goddamn it.<br> They did what?<br> Evidently to install bugs|and photograph documents.<br> It was a fishing expedition. It was|their fourth attempt at the D.N.C.<br> O'Brien doesn't even use that office.<br> It's possible|they were looking for evidence...<br> ...of an illegal Howard Hughes|donation to the Democrats.<br> The Democrats could make an issue|of your Hughes money.<br> It was a legal contribution.<br> It's not clear the burglars even knew|what they were looking for.<br> They were headed for McGovern's office|Later that same night.<br> Did Mitchell know about this?|I don't know.<br> Mitchell's out of his mind right now.|Martha put her head through a window.<br> Jesus. Through a window?<br> Yeah, they're taking her to Bellevue.|Maybe she'll stay this time.<br> Martha's an idiot. She'll do anything|to get Mitchell's attention.<br> If Mitchell had been minding the store|instead of that nut Martha...<br> ...we wouldn't have this kid MacGruder|running some third-rate burglary.<br> We feel the bigger concern|is Gordon Liddy.<br> Liddy? That fruitcake? What about him?|That's just it, sir.<br> He is a nut.<br> He used to work here with the plumbers,|turns up running this Watergate caper.<br> Remember his plan to firebomb Brookings|using Cubans as firemen?<br> What's Liddy got?|He was using some campaign cash...<br> ...that was laundered for us through|Mexico, the F.B.I.'s onto it.<br> We could have|a problem with that.<br> But that's just a campaign|finance violation.<br> So, if...Yeah, if Liddy|takes the rap for Watergate...<br> ...we can take care of him|and that lets us off the hook.<br> I don't have time for all this shit.|Just handle it, Bob.<br> Keep it out of the White House.|I gotta see Kissinger.<br> He's throwing a tantrum,|threatening to quit. Again.<br> What else?<br> Well, sir, uh...<br> ...one of the people implicated|is still on the White House payroll.<br> Who?|Not another goddamn Cuban.<br> Uh, no, sir.|A guy named Hunt.<br> Howard Hunt, sir.<br> Hunt? Howard Hunt?<br> Dumb bastard left his White House|phone number in his hotel room.<br> He works for Colson.<br> He used him|on the Pentagon papers.<br> This guy dumped his wiretapping stuff|into his White House safe.<br> We're trying to figure out when he|stopped being a White House consultant.<br> Howard Hunt is working|For the White House?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> This is goddamn Disneyland.|Since when?<br> Since Chappaquiddick.|He wanted dirt on Kennedy.<br> Colson brought him in.|You know Hunt, sir?<br> Yeah, on the list|of horribles.<br> I know what he is and I know|what he tracks back to.<br> He was involved in the plumbers?|Oh, definitely.<br> Colson had him break into Bremer's|apartment after Bremer shot Wallace...<br> ...to plant McGovern's|campaign literature.<br> I had nothing to do|with that.<br> He was in this Ellsberg thing too?|Yes. You approved it, sir.<br> I did?<br> It was right after|the Pentagon papers broke.<br> They went in to get his psychiatric|records. We were working on China.<br> Fuck.<br> Out!<br> What the fuck?<br> You're not supposed to take pictures|of me! Take pictures of the files!<br> Give me that fucking film!<br> Howard Hunt.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> You open up that scab,|you'll uncover a lot of pus.<br> What do you mean?<br> Where's Hunt now?|He's in hiding.<br> He sent Liddy in|to talk to Dean.<br> And?|He wants money.<br> Then pay him.<br> I told him to get out of the country.|It's crazy to start a relationship...<br> What the hell are you doing, John,|screwing with the C.I.A.?<br> I don't care how much he wants.|Just pay him.<br> What are we|paying him for, sir?<br> Silence.<br> But, sir, you're covered.<br> It's only|this Ellsberg thing...<br> ...and if that comes out,|it's national security.<br> I say we cut ourselves loose from these|clowns, and that's all there is to it.<br> No, it's more than that.|I want Hunt paid.<br> We've never done that before, sir.|How do we do it?<br> We should set up a Cuban defence fund|on this and take care of all of'em.<br> Should we talk to Trini about paying?|No, keep Trini out of this.<br> And for God's sake,|keep Colson out.<br> It's time to baptize|Our young counsel here, Mr. Dean.<br> That means John can never talk about it.|Attorney-client privilege.<br> So get to it.|Uh-huh.<br> John, you stay close to this, okay?|Don't worry, sir.<br> Good.<br> Okay.<br> Did I approve|the Ellsberg thing? Huh?<br> You know, I'm glad we tape|all these conversations, but...<br> I never approved the break-in|At the Ellsbergs'.<br> Oh, maybe I approved it|After the fact.<br> Someday we gotta start|transcribing these tapes.<br> You approved that before the fact|because I went over it with you. But I...<br> But no one's gonna see these tapes.|That's right.<br> And it's really more of|a problem for Ehrlichman.<br> He's the one who fixed Hunt up|with the phony C.I.A. ID's.<br> But what else does Hunt|have on us?<br> We gotta turn off|the F.B.I., Bob.<br> You go to the C.I.A. and tell Helms|that Hunt is blackmailing the president.<br> Tell him Hunt and his Cuban friends|Know too damn much...<br> ...and if he goes public...|if Hunt goes public...<br> ...it will be a fiasco|for the C.I.A.<br> He'll know what I'm talking about.|All right.<br> Play it tough. That's the way they play|it, and the way we're gonna play it.<br> Don't lie to Helms and say|there's no involvement.<br> Just say this is a comedy of errors...|bizarre...without getting into it.<br> And, uh...<br> Say the president believes it's gonna|open up the whole Bay of Pigs again.<br> And tell Helms he should call|the F.B.I., call Pat Gray...<br> ...and say that we wish,|for the sake of the country...<br> ...that, uh, don't go any further|into this hanky-panky, period.<br> Bay of Pigs?<br> That was Kennedy's screw-up.|Why would that threaten us?<br> Just do what I say, Bob.<br> The only problem with that, sir...<br> It does get us into|obstruction of justice.<br> It's got nothing to do with justice,|Bob. It's national security.<br> How is this national security?<br> The president says it is.<br> Now, this isn't|a moral issue, Bob.<br> My job is to protect this country|from its enemies...<br> ...and its enemies are|inside the walls.<br> We gotta keep|our enemies at bay...<br> ...or our whole program|goes down the tubes.<br> Uh, Vietnam, China,|the Soviet Union.<br> When you look at|the big picture, Bob...<br> ...damn.|We end up doing good in this world.<br> So let's not screw it up|with a shit-ass, third-rate burglary.<br> What should I tell|Ziegler to tell the press?<br> Tell'em what we always tell'em.|Anything but the goddamn truth.<br> Fuck!<br> Say the president believes it's gonna|open up the whole Bay of Pigs again.<br> Put me in this position...|Bay of Pigs?<br> Expose me like this.|Why would that threaten us?<br> Why don't they|Just fucking shoot me?<br> In the election of 1860...<br> Abraham Lincoln said the question|was whether this nation could exist...<br> ...half-slave or half-free.<br> In the election of 1960|and with the world around us...<br> ...the question is whether the world|will exist half-slave or half-free.<br> And I think,|in the final analysis...<br> ...it depends upon what we do|here in the United States.<br> It's time America started moving again.<br> Mr. Nixon?<br> When it comes|to experience...<br> ...through the years I have sat|on the National Security Council;<br> I have been in the cabinet; I have met|with the legislative leaders...<br> Relax, everybody,|relax.<br> I've had discussions with|35 presidents, 9 prime ministers...<br> ...two emperors|and the Shah of Iran.<br> Jesus Christ. Has he told them|How many push-ups he can do yet?<br> Let's take|hydroelectric power.<br> What the hell happened to him?|He just got out of the hospital.<br> He hasn't taken one hour off|during this campaign, thanks to you.<br> When we consider|the line up of the world...<br> ...we find there are|590 million people on our side...<br> Shoulda slapped makeup on him.|It's not a beauty contest.<br> We'd better hope not.|And 600 million people are neutral.<br> What are you doing to him, Murray?|Look at him. He's not well.<br> He doesn't have to debate Kennedy.|The odds are 5-3 against us.<br> When it comes to politics...|He can win without doing this.<br> Senator Kennedy,|you have one minute for a rebuttal.<br> Castro is only the beginning of our|difficulties throughout Latin America.<br> Oh, shit, he's gonna do it.|Here it comes.<br> We have seen Cuba|go to the Communists.<br> Eight jet minutes|from the coast of Florida.<br> We must at tempt to strengthen the|democratic anti-Castro forces in exile.<br> These fighters have had virtually|no support from our government.<br> Son of a bitch!|What? What?<br> Kennedy was briefed|Last week by the C.I.A.<br> He's using it against us.|He knows we can't respond.|He wellshed on the deal.<br> If we had provided aid, we might never|have had Castro. Why didn't we?<br> Mr. Nixon?<br> Man, he's treading water.|All right, come on.<br> He violated national security, Dick.|Attack the bastard.<br> ...the Constitution of the|United States, so help me God.<br> Mr. Nixon.<br> Yeah. Uh...<br> Uh, I think...<br> I think that's|the sort of, uh...<br> ...very dangerous|and irresponsible suggestion...<br> It's over. More coffee?<br> Helping the Cuban exiles|who oppose Castro would, uh...<br> ...not only be a violation|of international law...<br> ...it would be an open invitation|for Mr. Khrushchev...<br> It's still very close.<br> Uh, Senator Kennedy's lead...<br> ...is about, uh, 700, 000.<br> Think maybe Daley|stuffed the ballot boxes himself?<br> In Texas, they had|the goddamn cattle voting.<br> The closest race in history, Dick,|and he stole it. Son of a bitch.<br> He outspent us and he still cheated.|A guy who's got every thing.<br> I can't believe it.<br> We came to Congress|together.<br> We were like brothers,|for Christ's sake.<br> It all figures. It's an obvious fraud.|We ask for a recount.<br> Don't be ridiculous.<br> Nobody has ever contested|a presidential election before.<br> Who's gonna do the counting?|The Democrats control Texas, Illinois.<br> We shift 25, 000 votes|in two states.<br> And how long will that take?|Six months, a year?<br> Meanwhile, what happens|to the country, Herb?<br> If I'd called his shot, I'd have won.|That's what I say.<br> Made me look soft.<br> "I feel very sorry for Nixon|No.<br> "because he does not know|who he is.<br> A teach stop he has to decide which|Nixon he's going to be at the moment...<br> ...which must be very exhausting.

I could|do that now.<br> I'm so afraid.<br> There's darkness out there.<br> I could always see|where I was going.<br> But is dark out there.<br> God, I've always been|afraid of the dark.<br> Buddy.<br> There are many fine careers.<br> This country needs|good farmers...<br> ...good businessmen,|good plumbers...<br> ...good carpenters.<br> I remember my old man.<br> I think that they would have|called him sort of a...<br> ...sort of a little man,|a common man.<br> Well, he didn't consider|himself that way.<br> You know what he was?<br> He was a streetcar motorman first.<br> Then he was a farmer.<br> Then he had a lemon ranch.<br> It was the poorest lemon ranch|in California, I can assure you.<br> He sold it before|they found oil on it.<br> Then he was a grocer.<br> But he was a great man...<br> ...because he did his job.<br> And every job counts|up to the hilt...<br> ...regardless of what happens.<br> Nobody will ever write a book,|probably, about my mother.<br> Well, I guess|all of you would...<br> ...say this|about your mother.<br> My mother was a saint.<br> And I think of her...<br> ...two boys dying|of tuberculosis...<br> ...and seeing each of them die.<br> And when they died...<br> Yes, she will have no books|written about her.<br> But she was a saint.<br> Now, however,|we look to the future.<br> I remember something, uh,|Theodore Roosevelt wrote...<br> ...when his first wife died...<br> ...in his twenties.<br> He thought the light|had gone from his life forever.<br> But he went on, and he|not only became president...<br> ...but as an ex-president,|he served his country...<br> ...always in the arena,|tempestuous, strong...<br> ...sometimes right,|sometimes wrong.<br> But he was a man.<br> And as I leave...<br> ...thas an example I think|all of us should remember.<br> See, we think sometimes|when, uh...<br> ...things happen|that don't go the right way;<br> ...we think that when someone|dear to us dies...<br> ...uh, when we lose|an election...<br> ...or when we suffer defeat...<br> ...that all is ended.<br> Not true.<br> Is only a beginning,|always...<br> ...because the greatness comes,|not when things go always good for you...<br> ...but the greatness comes...<br> ...when you're really tested...<br> ...when you take some knocks,|some disappointments...<br> ...when sadness comes.<br> Because only if you've been|in the deepest valley...<br> ...can you ever know|how magnificent it is...<br> ...to be on the highest mountain.<br> So I say to you on this occasion...<br> ...we leave, proud of the people|who have stood by us...<br> ...and worked for us and served|this government and this country.<br> They want you to continue|to serve in government...<br> ...if that is what you wish.<br> Remember,|always give your best.<br> Never get discouraged.<br> Never be petty.<br> Always remember,|others may hate you.<br> But those who hate you|don't win unless you hate them.<br> And then,|you destroy yourself.<br> And so we leave with high hopes|and good spirits...<br> ...and with deep humility.<br> And I say to each|and every one of you...<br> ...not only will we always|remember you...<br> ...but always you will be...<br> ...in our hearts.<br> And you'll be...<br> ...in our prayers.<br> And only then will you find|what we Quakers call...<br> "peace at the center".<br> He gave of|himself with intelligence and energy...<br> ...and devotion to duty.<br> Richard Nixon was buried|and honored by five presidents...<br> ...on April 26, 1994...<br> ...less than a year after his|beloved wife, Pat, had died.<br> Nixon always maintained that|if he had not been driven from office...<br> ...the North Vietnamese would not|have overwhelmed the South in 1975.<br> In a sideshow, Cambodian society was|destroyed and mass genocide resulted.<br> The second half of the 20th century...<br> ...will be known|as the age of Nixon.<br> In his absence,|Russia and the United States returned...<br> ...to a decade of high-budget|military expansion and near war.<br> Nixon, who was pardoned|by President Ford...<br> ...lived to write six books...<br> ...and travel the world|as an elder statesman.<br> For the remainder of his life...<br> ...he fought successfully|to protect his tapes.<br> The National Archives|spent 14 years...<br> ...indexing and cataloging them.<br> Out of 4,000 hours,|60 hours have been made public.<br>
