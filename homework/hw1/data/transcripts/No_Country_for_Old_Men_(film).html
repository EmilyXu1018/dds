                        I was sheriff of this county when I was<br> twenty-five years old.<br> Hard to believe.<br> Grandfather was a lawman.<br> Father too.<br> Me and him was sheriff at the same time,<br> him up in Plano and me out here.<br> I think he was pretty proud of that.<br> I know I was.<br> Some of the old-time sheriffs<br> never even wore a gun.<br> A lot of folks find that<br> hard to believe.<br> Jim Scarborough never carried one.<br> That the younger Jim.<br> Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one<br> up in Commanche County.<br> Now I always liked to hear about<br> the old-timers.<br> Never missed a chance to do so.<br> You can't help but compare yourself<br> against the old-timers.<br> Can't help but wonder how they<br> would've operated these times.<br> There is this boy I sent to the electric<br> chair in Huntsville here a while back.<br> My arrest and my testimony.<br> He killed a fourteen-year-old girl.<br> Papers said it was a crime of passion but<br> he told me there wasn't any passion to it.<br> Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody<br> for about as long as he could remember.<br> Said if they turned him out he'd do it again.<br> Said he knew he was going to hell.<br> Be there in about fifteen minutes.<br> I don't know what to make of that.<br> I surely don't.<br> The crime you see now, it's hard<br> to even take its measure.<br> It's not that I'm afraid of it.<br> I always knew you had to be willing<br> to die to even do this job.<br> But I don't want to push my chips forward...<br> ...and go out and meet something<br> I don't understand.<br> A man would have to put his soul at hazard.<br> He just have to say, okay.<br> I'll be part of this world.<br> Yessir, I just walked in the door.<br> Sheriff he had some sort of<br> thing on him like a...<br> ...oxygen tanks for emphysema or something.<br> And a hose that run down his sleeve...<br> You got me.<br> You'll look at it when you get in.<br> Yessir, I got it under control.<br> Howdy, what's this about?<br> Step out of the car please, sir.<br> What is it?<br> I need you to step out of the car, sir.<br> What is that for?<br> Would you hold still please, sir.<br> Hold still.<br> Agua.<br> ...Agua.

Whether they<br> stopped it? And when?<br> Yessir.<br> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about<br> the lock cylinder?<br> - Yessir. It was punched out.<br> - Okay.<br> You wanna drive out there?<br> No, that's all I've to look for and it sounds like<br> these old boys died of natural causes.<br> How's that, Sheriff?<br> Natural to the line of work they was in.<br> Yessir.<br> My god, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I can't<br> think of any other word for it.<br> Who are these people?<br> Here last week they found this couple out...<br> ...in California, they'd rent out<br> rooms to old people.<br> Kill em, bury em in the yard and cash their<br> social security checks.<br> They'd torture them first.<br> I don't know why.<br> Maybe their television set was broke.<br> And this went on until, and here I quote:<br> Neighbors were alerted when a man ran<br> from the premises wearing only a dog collar.<br> You can't make up such a thing as that.<br> I dare you to even try.<br> But that's what it took, you'll notice.<br> Get somebody's attention.<br> Diggin graves in the back yard<br> didn't bring any.<br> That's all right. I laugh<br> myself sometimes.<br> There ain't a whole lot else you can do.<br> Tell me something.<br> Who do you think gets through this gate<br> into the United States of America?<br> I don't know.

How you come to be<br> out here with no clothes?<br> I got an overcoat on.<br> - Are you jackin' with me?<br> - Oh, no sir.<br> - Don't jack with me.<br> - Yes sir.<br> - Are you in the service?<br> - No sir.

With you gone and<br> I don't have the money, he can't touch me.<br> But I can sure touch him.<br> And after I find him I'll<br> come and join you.<br> Find who?

Those hombres<br> would've taken the stash.<br> I suppose so. Though they was<br> leavin' in a hurry.<br> It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom.<br> The money and the drugs.<br> It's just goddamned beyond everything.<br> What's it mean?<br> What's it leading to?<br> You know, if you'd a told me twenty years<br> ago, I'd see children walking...<br> the streets of our Texas towns with green<br> hair and bones in their noses.<br> I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.<br> Signs and wonders. But I think once<br> you quit hearin' sir and ma'am,...<br> ...the rest is soon to follow.<br> Oh, it's the tide.<br> It's the dismal tide.<br> - It is not the one thing.<br> - Not the one thing.<br> None of that explains your man though.<br> He's just a goddamn homicidal<br> lunatic, Ed Tom.<br> - I'm not sure he's a lunatic.<br> - Yeah well, what would you call him?<br> I don't know. Sometimes I think<br> he's pretty much a ghost.<br> - He's real all right.<br> - Oh yeah?<br> All that at the ???<br> Motel. It's beyond everything.<br> Yeah, he has some hard bark on him.<br> That don't hardly say it.<br> He shoots the desk clerk one day.<br> Walks right back in the next<br> and shoots a retired army colonel.<br> It's hard to believe.<br> Strolls right back into a crime scene.<br> Who would do such a thing?<br> How do you defend against it?<br> Good trip, Ed Tom.<br> I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy.<br> Min back!<br> - How'd you know I was here?<br> - Who else'd be driving up your truck?<br> - You heard it?<br> - How's that?<br> - You heard what I'm - you havin fun with me?<br> - What give you that idea?<br> - I seen one of the cats heard it.<br> - But - how'd you know it was my truck?<br> I deduced it.

Nothin.<br> Wouldn't be no point to it.<br> I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.<br> Well, all the time you spend<br> tryin' to get back...<br> ...what's been took from you more<br> is goin' out the door.<br> After a while, you just have to try<br> to get a tourniquet on it.<br> Your granddaddy never asked me<br> to sign on as a deputy.<br> Loretta tells me you're quittin'.<br> How come're you doin' that?<br> I don't know.<br> I feel overmatched.<br> I always figured when I got older,...<br> ...God would sort of come into<br> my life in some way.<br> He didn't.<br> I don't blame him.<br> If I was him I'd have the same opinion<br> about me that he does.<br> You don't know what he thinks.<br> I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and<br> badge over to the Rangers.<br> Put up in a museum.<br> Your daddy ever tell you how<br> Uncle Mac come to his reward?<br> Gunned down on his own porch<br> over in Hudspeth County.<br> Seven or eight of 'em come up to here.<br> Wantin' this and wantin' that.<br> Uncle Mac went back in the house<br> and got the shotgun,...<br> They was way ahead of him.<br> Shot him in the doorway.<br> Aunt Ella came out and tried to stop the bleedin'.<br> Uncle Mac all the while tryin'<br> to get that shotgun.<br> They just sat there on their<br> horses watchin' him die.<br> After a while, one of 'em says somethin in<br> Injun and they all turned and left out.<br> Well, Uncle Mac knew the score<br> even if Aunt Ella didn't.<br> Shot through the left lung.<br> And that was that. As they say.<br> - When did he die?<br> - 1909.<br> No, I mean was it right away or in<br> the night or when was it?<br> I believe it's that night. She<br> buried him the next mornin'.<br> Diggin' in that hard old caliche.<br> What you got ain't nothin new.<br> This country is hard on people.<br> You can't stop what's comin'.<br> Ain't all waitin' on you.<br> That's vanity.<br> - I knew this wasn't done with.<br> - No.<br> I ain't got the money.<br> What little I had is long gone and<br> there's bills aplenty to pay yet.<br> I buried my mother today.<br> I ain't paid for that neither.<br> I wouldn't worry about it.<br> I need to sit down.<br> You got no cause to hurt me.<br> No. But I gave my word.<br> - You gave your word?<br> - To your husband.<br> That don't make sense. You gave your<br> word to my husband to kill me?<br> Your husband had the<br> opportunity to save you.<br> Instead, he used you to try<br> to save himself.<br> Not like that.<br> Not like you say.<br> You don't have to do this.<br> They'll always say the same thing.<br> What did they say?<br> They say you don't have to do this.<br> You don't.<br> This is the best I can do.<br> Call it.<br> I knowed you was crazy when<br> I saw you sittin' there.<br> I knowed exactly what was in store for me.<br> - Call it.<br> - No.<br> I ain't gonna call it.<br> - Call it.<br> - The coin don't have no say.<br> It's just you.<br> Well, I got here the same<br> way the coin did.<br> Mister, there's a bone stickin' out of your arm.<br> I'm alright. Let me just sit<br> here a minute.<br> There's an ambulance comin'.<br> Man over yonder went to call.<br> Alright.<br> Are you all right? You got a<br> bone stickin' out of your arm.<br> What will you take for that shirt?<br> Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.<br> Look at that fuckin' bone.<br> Tie this for me.<br> Just tie it.<br> Hell mister. Look, I don't mind helping<br> someone out. That's a lot of money.<br> Take it. Take it and you<br> didn't see me.<br> I was already gone.<br> Yessir.<br> - Part of that's mine.<br> - You still got your damn shirt.<br> - That ain't what it was for.<br> - Well maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.<br> - Maybe I'll go ridin'.<br> - Okay.<br> - What do you think?<br> - I can't plan your day.<br> I mean, would you care to join me?<br> Lord no. I'm not retired.<br> Maybe I'll help out here then.<br> Better not.<br> - How'd you sleep?<br> - I don't know. Had dreams.<br> Well you got time for 'em now.<br> Anything interesting?<br> They always is to the<br> party concerned.<br> Ed Tom, I'll be polite.<br> Okay. Two of 'em. Both<br> had my father. It's peculiar.<br> I'm older now than he ever<br> was by twenty years.<br> So, in a sense he's the younger man.<br> Anyway, first one I don't remember<br> too well but...<br> It was about meeting him in town someplace<br> where he gave me some money.<br> I think I lost it.<br> The second one, it was like we<br> was both back in older times...<br> ...and I was on horseback goin'<br> through the mountains of a night.<br> Goin' through this pass in the mountains.<br> It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and<br> kept on goin'. Never said nothin goin' by. He just rode on past.<br> He had his blanket wrapped around<br> him and his head down.<br> When he rode past I seen he was...<br> ...carryin fire in a horn...<br> ...the way people used to do and I could see<br> the horn from the light inside of it.<br> About the color of the moon.<br> And in the dream I knew that<br> he was goin' on ahead...<br> and that he's fixin to make a fire somewhere<br> out there in all that dark and all that cold.<br> I knew that whenever I got<br> there he'd be there.<br> Then, I woke up.<br>
