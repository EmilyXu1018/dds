No more.<br> All right.<br> Stop singing that song, Sammy.<br> - Why not? It's a cool song.<br> - It's not a cool song.<br> - Will I get my own bedroom?<br> - Karen, please, no screaming.<br> - Seriously.<br> - Hey, nobody's talking to you.<br> - Then why am I even here?<br> - Because you're still a part of this family.<br> Oh, so now we're a family?<br> What the hell's the matter with you?<br> Karen, honey.<br> - It's pink, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's great.<br> I just don't know if I can come up<br> with 20 percent down.<br> Can you do 10?<br> - How about 5?<br> - We can work something out.<br> How about that, huh?<br> What do you guys think?<br> - Definitely. Take it.<br> - I think it sucks.<br> Someday you're gonna<br> beg me to forgive you...<br> ...for being such a horse's ass<br> on the biggest day of my life. And I won't.<br> Holy crap.<br> Look at that long face.<br> Somebody thought I forgot<br> about her, huh? But I didn't.<br> There's a surprise outside.<br> Cover your eyes.<br> - You ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Keep them closed.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay?<br> There it is.<br> Well, I'm sure the neighbors heard.<br> - Come on, Sammy.<br> - Get on there.<br> Now you're gonna bounce really high.<br> Come on. Come on, Karen.<br> So, Josey, I know I've been<br> giving you a hard time.<br> But I want you to know that<br> I had a talk with the guys.<br> And I'm gonna give it a shot, okay?<br> Give what a shot?<br> You know, being cool with you<br> and whatnot.<br> Okay. All right.<br> As you can see, the conveyor's down.<br> So I need someone to get up there,<br> see if something's clogging the works.<br> If all's smooth in the tube,<br> you just come on home.<br> Think you can do it?<br> All right.<br> Go on. Nothing to be scared of.<br> All clear on number four.<br> I repeat, all clear on number four.<br> Oh, God.<br> Can you imagine falling down there?<br> Nobody would ever find you.<br> Two minutes, five ton of rock<br> would be on top of you.<br> Hello!<br> Oh, man. I remember the first<br> few times I came out here.<br> Oh, I hated it.<br> Then I realized, you know,<br> I could just stand out here, you know...<br> ...and smoke a joint<br> and what have you...<br> ...nobody'd be the wiser.<br> I mean, we're totally fucking alone.<br> So, what do you say, Josey,<br> you wanna, I don't know...<br> ...kiss and make up?<br> - Come on, just one kiss.<br> - I'm going back.<br> Hey, come on, what's the matter<br> with you, Josey?<br> It's not like... Am I hurting you?<br> I ain't hurting you, am I?<br> All right, fine then.<br> Go on.<br> No, that was pretty typical behavior,<br> you wanna know the truth.<br> What do you mean, "typical"?<br> Josey made a lot<br> of mountains from molehills.<br> Always misconstruing things,<br> you know, paranoid stuff.<br> She was pretty emotional.<br> When she told you what happened out in<br> the number four conveyor, what did you do?<br> I yanked Bobby into my office<br> for a sit-down.<br> - He said she...<br> - Objection. Hearsay.<br> - Sustained.<br> - Mr. Pavich...<br> ...how do you know who to believe<br> in a situation like that?<br> Your Honor, is she kidding<br> with that question?<br> Maybe she could ask if he likes<br> pia coladas and walks in the rain.<br> Are you kidding with that objection,<br> Mr. White?<br> Because it's denied.<br> The witness may answer.<br> Look, men will always walk the line.<br> It's when they cross over it...<br> ...is when most gals<br> give them a slap on the hand...<br> ...get them back on their side<br> of that line.<br> That's how men and women have been<br> handling problems since Adam and Eve.<br> Okay, guys, that's it.<br> I'm out of here.<br> - Hey, you want a ride?<br> - Josey, stay a moment, would you?<br> I'd like to have a word with you.<br> Later.<br> Don't stick me.<br> That looks great.<br> Okay. We'll get it straight this time.<br> Stand up straight.<br> Was that my dress?<br> - A little young for Communion, no?<br> - No, never too young to be with God.<br> You been watching this?<br> - He referred to the size<br> of his own penis...<br> - Oh, dear God. Turn it off.<br> ...as being larger than norm...<br> That poor man's family.<br> - Alice?<br> - Here.<br> Great. I'm not staying long.<br> Just wanna let you know Sammy's<br> got a game on Sunday.<br> We're busy Sunday.<br> Don't do this to him.<br> You're doing it to him.<br> You can quit anytime.<br> Pop. We got a house.<br> - We got the loan and everything.<br> - You want me to congratulate you?<br> You act like I'm stealing.<br> I work damn hard every day, same as you.<br> - Now you're the same as me.<br> - Oh, no. There's a few differences.<br> You don't go scared of what they<br> write about you on walls...<br> ...or what kind of disgusting thing<br> you might find in your locker.<br> You don't gotta be scared that one of these<br> days you'll come to work and get raped.<br> You done?<br> Yeah, I'm done.<br> Come on!<br> Faster!<br> What are you doing bringing him?<br> - I'll see you over there.<br> - Lf at first you don't succeed...<br> - Thanks, Bill.<br> - Thanks.<br> - What's that all about?<br> - He's famous.<br> They got a picture of him<br> in the Hockey Hall of Fame.<br> Bill. Bill. Josey, I don't think<br> you and Bill have met, have you?<br> No, we haven't.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi.<br> - Which one's yours?<br> - There he is, number 12.<br> Tell me he's not 0-for-cute.<br> Get a new project. I'm fine.<br> Well, look at that.<br> Good for him.<br> Oh, God...!<br> - Inside, Sammy!<br> - Get off the board!<br> Oh, Jesus, I hate this game.<br> Kid's pretty quick on the ice.<br> Go, go, go.<br> - Pass it out! Pass it out!<br> - I'm open!<br> What?<br> Nobody passes anymore.<br> Why didn't you pass?<br> My dad would kill me<br> if I passed the puck to you.<br> You want some chili?<br> Yeah, I'll go with you.<br> But you said you weren't hungry.<br> Gotta be smart to be a lawyer, right?<br> You have a high opinion of lawyers.<br> Man, I love the sounds, you know?<br> Wood knocking on the ice.<br> The slush of the blades.<br> Figured hockey wouldn't<br> take care of me forever.<br> Thought a law degree might.<br> - What happened?<br> - Don't listen to me.<br> I'm in a bitter phase. What about you?<br> What do you do?<br> I work at Pearson's.<br> - In the mine?<br> - Yep.<br> You don't smell like a miner.<br> - You Josey Aimes?<br> - Yeah.<br> Stay the hell away from my husband.<br> Goddamn mining whores.<br> You keep away from Bobby,<br> you know what's good for you!<br> - Bobby? Bobby Sharp?<br> - Tossing your ass around lost your marriage.<br> Don't think I'm gonna<br> let you mess with mine.<br> You hear that?<br> Is it true?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Everybody heard. My father, my kids.<br> I mean, can somebody say things like that?<br> You know, legally or whatever?<br> - In front of the whole goddamn world?<br> - Only if it's true.<br> Well, it's not. He came on to me.<br> - Then it's slander.<br> - What are you gonna do, sue him?<br> Well, could I?<br> Best thing you could do is just let it go.<br> Miss Aimes? Hi, I'm Stacey.<br> - Sammy's girlfriend?<br> - Sammy's got a girlfriend?<br> Sammy says to tell you that<br> he's gonna stay at my house tonight.<br> Is that so? And where is Sammy?<br> He's over there in my mom's car,<br> and she said it's fine.<br> - Really? Sammy's mom says it's not.<br> - Hey, Josey, come on.<br> Great job today.<br> Sammy. Get out of the car now!<br> - He's very upset, maybe...<br> - Don't tell me about my son.<br> - Get out.<br> - No!<br> - I said, get out of the car, now!<br> - Let go!<br> Get out of the car! Go to the truck.<br> - You're a whore, just like everyone says.<br> - Don't ever talk to me like that!<br> Hey, hey! Josey, stop it, now!<br> You're gonna tell me how to be a parent?<br> Glory, with all your personal experience?<br> Karen, get in the truck.<br> Now, get in the truck!<br> You want a show? Huh?<br> Is that what you want?<br> You can all go to hell!<br> After that she kind of lost it.<br> When you say "lost it"?<br> Ranting all the time about<br> how we shouldn't take it anymore...<br> ...how the company wasn't protecting us,<br> the union wasn't protecting us.<br> What did she think<br> you needed protection from?<br> - Don't know.<br> - Did you have any problems getting along...<br> ...with the men at the mine?<br> - I didn't bother them...<br> ...they didn't bother me.<br> Hey, Peg! Three for a dollar.<br> Got change for a dollar?<br> You kill me. She was like:<br> It's what they've been talking about<br> on the news every day, sexual harassment.<br> - Hey, Sherry?<br> - Yeah?<br> - What's this one do?<br> - Exfoliator, 11.99.<br> - Oh, gee.<br> - All right.<br> - Hello?<br> - It's me.<br> Glory can't make it. She's got a bad flu.<br> - Oh, no, I need her here.<br> - I told you, Josey, she's sick.<br> Well, can I talk to her?<br> Josey, she's not coming, all right?<br> What are you doing?<br> What I was saying was<br> I think we should go to Pearson.<br> - You know? Tell him what's going on.<br> - What do you get out of this?<br> Jeez, Peg, I'm just trying<br> to make things better.<br> Not you. I'm talking to Sherry. How much<br> do you get paid to sell this stuff?<br> Five percent of each sale.<br> Don't expect to get rich from me.<br> I'm not buying.<br> - What about what happened to you, Peg...?<br> - That's my business.<br> Actually, it's all of our business.<br> - It's happening to all of us.<br> - Tell you one thing...<br> ...l'm sick of having my ass grabbed<br> by a bunch of old men.<br> Maybe you've been asking for it.<br> - Ever think of that?<br> - Up yours, Peg.<br> Hey, you could quit tomorrow.<br> Go sell your face cream.<br> - I need my job.<br> - You don't know shit about me.<br> I need this job just as much as you.<br> Okay, okay. Now, what would you<br> even say to Pearson?<br> That we've been sexually harassed?<br> - Honey, he'd laugh you out of his office.<br> - Not to mention what the guys would do.<br> - All that "never rat on a brother" crap.<br> - Yeah?<br> Union oath says, "Respect fellow members."<br> Where's our respect?<br> Where is it?<br> Come on, who's coming with me?<br> - What else you got there?<br> - A lot.<br> Will it get all the soot off my hands?<br> Sherry, Sherry, quite contrary<br> Kiss my ass, it's really hairy<br> Oh, a real funny guy.<br> What are you doing in the pit?<br> - Filling in for Glory while she's out.<br> - Just in time to use the new Porta-Jane?<br> You don't mind, we took<br> a big dump in that this morning.<br> Oh, how charming.<br> Sherry!<br> Hey, cut it out! Stop it!<br> Cut it out!<br> - What the hell's going on?<br> - They got Sherry in the crapper!<br> Stop it, guys!<br> Cut it out, it's not funny!<br> - Somebody's gonna get hurt.<br> - Knock it off!<br> Let her out! That's enough.<br> Turn this fucker over!<br> What the hell?<br> Send her in, please.<br> Miss Aimes. Sorry to keep you<br> waiting so long. Please, sit.<br> Gentlemen.<br> I asked some of my colleagues<br> to sit in, if you don't mind.<br> - No.<br> - I believe you know Mr. Pavich?<br> Yes, I do. Mr. Pavich was the one<br> who told me I had to take a day off work...<br> ...to come and see you.<br> - I didn't want to waste your time, sir.<br> - Well, I appreciate that.<br> But it's not a waste at all.<br> Miss Aimes has a problem,<br> and we're gonna solve it.<br> Thank you, Mr. Pearson.<br> That's... That's really great.<br> I didn't want to forget anything,<br> so I wrote a couple of things down...<br> ...on a piece of paper here.<br> Excuse me, Josey...<br> Do you mind if I call you Josey?<br> - No.<br> - I'd like to make this easier for you...<br> ...if you don't mind.<br> I know what you're going to tell me.<br> I've been well-briefed.<br> Great. I just thought<br> that a few of these...<br> Please, I think you'll be<br> pleasantly surprised.<br> Okay.<br> Well, the current union<br> contract requires...<br> ...that an employee provide us<br> with two weeks' notice...<br> ...before leaving his position.<br> However, given how obviously<br> emotional this has been for you...<br> ...we're willing to do something<br> special in this case.<br> We've decided to waive<br> the two-week requirement...<br> ...and allow you to tender your resignation<br> effective immediately.<br> No. I'm sorry, I'm not resigning.<br> - Mr. Pavich will take care of the details.<br> - Happy to.<br> No.<br> I'm not quitting.<br> I need this job.<br> Well, then I suggest you spend less time<br> stirring up your female co-workers...<br> ...and less time in the beds<br> of your married male co-workers...<br> ...and more time trying to find ways<br> to improve your job performance.<br> Does anyone else have anything to add?<br> That says it.<br> Josey, thank you again<br> for making the drive down here.<br> Now, if you don't mind,<br> we have other business.<br> - To teach at Oral Roberts University<br> opened up.<br> When I informed him<br> that I was leaving in July...<br> ...I recall that his response<br> was that now I would no longer...<br> ...have an excuse<br> for not going out with him.<br> - I told him that I still preferred not to do so.<br> - Hey.<br> Where have you been?<br> He made a comment<br> that I will vividly remember.<br> He said that if I ever told anyone<br> of his behavior that it would ruin his career.<br> This was not an apology...<br> - Sammy, can I come in?<br> - Why?<br> I was only 20 minutes late.<br> - Don't freak.<br> - You know, I'm still the mom here.<br> Yeah, right.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - Nothing.<br> Just most people's mothers<br> cook and clean.<br> They don't work at the mine.<br> Remember you used to tell me you<br> want to be a doctor when you grew up?<br> - So?<br> - So.<br> I used to tell you<br> you could be anything you want.<br> Isn't it the same for me?<br> - Aren't I allowed to be anything I want?<br> - Not when you're doing someone else's job.<br> Bill White's signing some autographs<br> down at the rink on Saturday.<br> - We could go...<br> - I don't want an autograph...<br> ...from one of your loser boyfriends.<br> - He's not my boyfriend.<br> And he's not a loser.<br> He broke some record<br> in high school or something.<br> - Yeah. A million years ago.<br> - Jesus, I'm just trying here, you know.<br> It was something we could do together.<br> - You love hockey...<br> - I quit the team.<br> You quit?<br> When?<br> Who cares?<br> I care.<br> You love that team.<br> Why didn't you talk to me about it?<br> Because I don't want to talk to you.<br> Don't you get it?<br> I'll get her to call you.<br> I'm not leaving till I see her.<br> She doesn't have the flu, Josey.<br> God.<br> Guess he told you, huh?<br> - How you feeling?<br> - Great.<br> I never heard of...<br> I mean, I've heard of Lou Gehrig.<br> - I just never knew about the disease.<br> - I know.<br> It's...<br> It's kind of like piece by piece,<br> your body quits listening to you.<br> Like a bullheaded teenager.<br> So how's Sammy doing?<br> Hates me.<br> I'd like to say time heals all, but...<br> Sure you should be drinking that?<br> Well, sooner or later, my liver's gonna<br> crash and burn on me, so until then...<br> ...l'm still in the driver's seat.<br> You never could keep a secret.<br> Me? The whole town knows<br> I only have one ball because of you.<br> - You only got one what?<br> - Now the whole town knows.<br> Jeez.<br> - Does it...? I mean, can you...?<br> - Works great.<br> You only need one. A big one.<br> Oh, God.<br> Watch out.<br> - Okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom?<br> - No, go ahead.<br> But come back smiling, or I'll describe<br> to you what's gonna happen to my asshole.<br> - God, what's that smell?<br> - Toilets overflowed again.<br> I suggest you ladies<br> get some sponges and buckets...<br> ...and get that room cleaned<br> before somebody gets sick.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Go in.<br> Look for yourself.<br> Oh, my God.<br> They can't do this to us.<br> Sure, they can.<br> They're gonna keep on doing it worse,<br> as long as you keep opening your mouth.<br> - Sherry, what they did to you...<br> - You didn't help any.<br> That's for sure.<br> Don't look at me.<br> This is our lives you're screwing with.<br> Your mess, start cleaning.<br> Hey, Josey, how you like<br> your new scratch-and-sniff wallpaper?<br> Was it him? Was it?<br> I give a piece of my check<br> to that union, like everyone else.<br> You fucked up.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> Hey, lovebirds, wanna get to work?<br> Or should I dim the lights for you?<br> Josey, get your ass down here.<br> I got a job for you in the Powder Room.<br> You're one crazy bitch, you know that?<br> - You said you had a job for me.<br> - Yeah.<br> You like that, don't you?<br> You like that.<br> To grab your pussy like that, don't you?<br> Forgot you like it a little rough.<br> You're gonna learn the goddamn rules<br> if I have to beat them into you myself.<br> Damn you, Josey.<br> He attacked me.<br> - Who attacked you?<br> - Bobby, in the Powder Room, just now.<br> - Bobby, you lay a hand on her?<br> - Sure you wanna ask that, Rick?<br> The answer's no.<br> I wasn't in the Powder Room all day.<br> He was working the concentrator<br> with me all afternoon.<br> See? You gonna call me and Earl<br> liars now? Come on.<br> Ricky.<br> Can somebody drive me home, please?<br> - Where's your dad?<br> - He's on nights.<br> - Just take my keys from my locker.<br> - Betty.<br> Don't.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> I quit.<br> The rules are clear. Go around the union,<br> you broke your oath.<br> Period, the end.<br> Glory.<br> - What you doing here?<br> - What's it look like?<br> I'm here for the meeting.<br> Well, you're not an employee anymore.<br> You're not required to be here.<br> Yeah, well. Thought maybe<br> I could help you out.<br> Kind of out of control up there, isn't it?<br> I'm not saying Josey should've<br> gone to management or anything...<br> We were all sorry to hear you're sick.<br> - Glory...<br> - Don't. Don't help me.<br> I mean, if you help me, I'll cry.<br> Please don't.<br> Need an autographed hockey puck?<br> - Got a hundred of them out here.<br> - I need a lawyer.<br> I wanna sue the mine.<br> The company. All of them.<br> Well, good luck with that.<br> I'm saying I wanna hire you.<br> Sorry, don't do that anymore.<br> That sucks, because you're<br> the only lawyer I ever met.<br> Well, the good news is,<br> all roads lead to lawyers.<br> Tell you what.<br> I will buy you a beer, though.<br> I don't need a beer.<br> I need a lawyer.<br> Look, Josey, the illusion is that<br> all your problems are solved in a courtroom.<br> The reality is that even<br> when you win, you don't win.<br> I know, but I'm right.<br> I'm sure you are, but right<br> has nothing to do with the real world.<br> Look at Anita Hill. Because she's you.<br> You think you're outgunned at the mine,<br> wait till you get to a courtroom.<br> It's called the "nuts and sluts defense."<br> You're either nuts and you imagined it,<br> or a slut and you asked for it.<br> Either way, it's not pleasant.<br> Take my advice. Find another job.<br> Start over.<br> I don't have any start-over left.<br> - Look, you're a beautiful girl...<br> - Yeah, I'm a beautiful girl.<br> I could find a guy to take care of me.<br> I'm done looking to be taken care of.<br> I wanna take care of myself.<br> Take care of my kids.<br> You know it's happening to all of us.<br> Every woman up there.<br> But you don't give a shit, do you?<br> If somebody like her came to see me<br> back in New York with this dogshit case...<br> ...you know what I'd do?<br> I'd take it.<br> Settle quick, pocket the contingency...<br> ...make more money than her,<br> never see a courtroom.<br> Pearson would never settle.<br> - Sure he would.<br> - No.<br> It would be her word<br> against everybody else.<br> All the guys up there can't be bad,<br> which makes some of them witnesses.<br> That mine is bread and butter<br> for people around here.<br> Nobody wants to shit where they eat.<br> What is this place?<br> Like a pet cemetery or something?<br> Why, you got a lot of pet elk at home?<br> So they never picked on Glory, why?<br> Would you wanna<br> pick a fight with Glory?<br> No, Glory became a union rep early on.<br> She did some good things.<br> Got their respect.<br> Plus, she doesn't wanna<br> run with the herd.<br> - Keeps her head above the fray.<br> - Safety in numbers.<br> Herds. They stay together,<br> they have a chance.<br> They separate, they're easy prey.<br> Can you get the other women?<br> You know what a class action is?<br> It's when a bunch of plaintiffs<br> have the same issue.<br> File a claim on behalf<br> of the whole group, the class.<br> It's tough for the company<br> to argue that you're all lying.<br> You're all crazy.<br> It's why you have to get the others.<br> Why'd you change your mind?<br> It's never been done before.<br> Sexual harassment class action.<br> So you'd be doing this<br> just because it's never been done.<br> Yeah.<br> Can you live with that?<br> Sue them?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - You know what's going on up there.<br> Life is too short, trust me.<br> Not too short<br> to do something good with it.<br> How do you know? You're still alive.<br> - So are you, you know.<br> - You call this alive?<br> Get out of here.<br> - I didn't...<br> - Get the hell...<br> ...out of here.<br> It's not just one or two bad guys.<br> It takes a village<br> to do what's being done here.<br> I'm not saying all of them.<br> But enough of them.<br> In the plant, out in the pit,<br> and even up in the offices...<br> ...all with the foot on the throat<br> of every woman in that mine.<br> It's not just my client who needs relief<br> from this court, Your Honor.<br> We are asking for an injunction<br> to protect all the women.<br> Further, we ask the court<br> to certify a class.<br> A class made up of every woman<br> working at Pearson...<br> ...because every one of them<br> deserves protection under the law.<br> Doesn't a class actually require<br> more than one plaintiff?<br> This complaint was filed<br> on behalf of one Josey Aimes.<br> The key word being "one."<br> By comparison, we have affidavits<br> from 13 women...<br> ...all stating there have been<br> no incidents of abuse...<br> That is not true.<br> Hey.<br> Sit down.<br> - It's not true.<br> - Sit down.<br> Your Honor, are you as confused<br> as we are?<br> I don't think Miss Conlin is supposed<br> to be waving around a pile of paper...<br> ...without letting us see it first, is she?<br> - No, she's not. Miss Conlin.<br> - They'll be submitted to the court today.<br> It doesn't matter what kind of document<br> they've been intimidated into signing...<br> - Give me a break.<br> - Please.<br> - Get me three plaintiffs.<br> - Your Honor, please.<br> Counselor, if those affidavits are legitimate,<br> you shouldn't have an objection.<br> I'll continue to hear evidence<br> on Aimes v.

I'd like to see you do it.<br> It's easy when you're crazy.<br> She's definitely crazy.<br> - Hey, let me borrow some of that cream.<br> - Buy your own.<br> - Creep took half of mine.<br> - So you're okay getting on that stand...<br> ...and saying she's lying, right?<br> I'm gonna do what I gotta do.<br> Plus, we all signed<br> those affidavits already...<br> ...which means we don't have<br> a choice anymore, right?<br> Right, Betty?<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> Who is Sammy's father?<br> I don't know who Sammy's father is.<br> Because you've had so many<br> sexual partners?<br> Objection. Plaintiff's sexual history<br> is irrelevant, Your Honor.<br> Overruled.<br> Miss Conlin, who is the gentleman<br> entering the courtroom?<br> Mr. Paul Lattavansky, Your Honor,<br> Miss Aimes' high school teacher.<br> We've subpoenaed him<br> as an impeachment witness.<br> I have so many objections,<br> I don't know where to start.<br> - Witness will answer.<br> - Again:<br> - Miss Aimes, who is Sammy's father...?<br> - My son...<br> ...has got nothing to do with any of this.<br> Is it true that you and your teacher...<br> ...Mr. Lattavansky, had a sexual<br> relationship at one time?<br> A "relationship"?<br> What the hell you been<br> telling them, Bobby?<br> Miss Aimes, did you not, at the age of 16,<br> engage in a sexual relationship...<br> ...with your high school teacher?<br> Oh, Josey, stay a moment, would you?<br> I'd like to have a word with you.<br> Later.<br> Okay.<br> What are you doing hanging around<br> a boy like Bobby Sharp?<br> You have so much more going for you...<br> ...than a kid like that'll ever have.<br> Do you like me, Josey?<br> - Far as teachers go.<br> - Yeah.<br> You're my favorite student.<br> Did I ever tell you that?<br> - No.<br> - Yeah.<br> Frankly...<br> - Josey?<br> - Yeah?<br> I'd like to think of you<br> as more than that.<br> No, no, it's okay.<br> Maybe even as a friend.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - It's okay.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - No, it's okay.<br> - Please don't do this, Mr. L.<br> - No, it's okay.<br> It'll be our little secret, okay?<br> No, no, no!<br> No!<br> No! No, stop! Stop!<br> Stop it! I don't wanna do this! Stop it!<br> - It's okay. It's okay.<br> - Stop!<br> Stop!<br> Are there any other witnesses<br> to this alleged rape?<br> Anybody besides Mr. Sharp<br> that can corroborate your testimony?<br> No.<br> Isn't it true that there was no rape?<br> In fact, you have a long history...<br> ...of inappropriate sexual relationships...<br> - Objection.<br> At the very least,<br> we're talking statutory rape.<br> - It's outrageous.<br> - You raped my daughter...<br> - Hank!<br> - Order! Bailiff!<br> - Help!<br> - Remove that man!<br> - Remove that man! Remove him.<br> - Let go! Let go of me.<br> Everybody take your seats.<br> Miss Aimes? Miss Aimes,<br> return to the stand, please.<br> Return to the stand, Miss Aimes!<br> Your Honor, move for recess? Please.<br> - Josey, wait. Slow down.<br> - No, I can't. I've gotta get home to Sammy.<br> We're gonna stay here tonight.<br> That's crazy, Mom.<br> He's gonna come home.<br> All the same.<br> We're gonna stay here.<br> I'd rather give you money...<br> ...if that's all right with you.<br> That's a pretty old watch.<br> Was just looking at it.<br> She's lying, you know.<br> She didn't get raped by that teacher.<br> She was just saying that<br> so she'll win her lawsuit.<br> It's illegal for her to say that<br> if it's not true.<br> She should go to jail.<br> I don't care.<br> She's a whore, just like everybody says.<br> I wonder if it's illegal to call<br> your own mother a whore.<br> - Sure sounds bad enough to be.<br> - She's a liar.<br> My father didn't die in the Army.<br> He's a scumbag raper.<br> - It's a hard truth to tell, Sammy.<br> - That's crap.<br> - I got a right.<br> - Yeah, you got a lot of rights...<br> ...starting with the right to be pissed off.<br> In fact, you got a right to hate<br> the whole world right now.<br> I don't hate the whole world.<br> I just hate her.<br> Takes a lot of work to hate someone.<br> You ready to put in that kind of time?<br> To really hate your mom...<br> ...you gotta think over and over again<br> about all the things you hate about her.<br> She's mean to you.<br> Never proud of you.<br> Never comes to watch<br> your hockey games.<br> - Leaves you hungry, never buys you clothes.<br> - I'm not stupid.<br> - I know what you're doing.<br> - What's that?<br> I know she does all those things.<br> Yeah.<br> But you hate her anyway.<br> Yeah.<br> I hate her guts.<br> Well, you're lucky.<br> She never gave up on you<br> as quick as you're giving up on her.<br> When she was a bit older<br> than you are now...<br> ...she got pregnant in a way<br> nobody should get pregnant.<br> Would've been a lot easier...<br> ...to give you up to someone else.<br> Nobody would've blamed her if she did,<br> but she didn't. She stuck by you.<br> And she's still sticking by you...<br> ...even though she knows you hate her.<br> She's still there waiting...<br> ...hoping you'll get your ass home.<br> - Take it.<br> - What?<br> Well, if you wanna run off,<br> you can sell it and use the money.<br> Or just put it on your wrist.<br> Either way, it's yours.<br> One friend to another.<br> Karen, go to bed.<br> I'll wake you when he comes back.<br> It's me.<br> I didn't want you, Sammy.<br> Something bad had happened to me,<br> and I just wanted it to be over.<br> But every day my belly grew,<br> and it just reminded me of it.<br> Never even occurred to me<br> that there was a baby in there.<br> That you were in there.<br> That day, what that man did to me...<br> ...it made me into something different.<br> And I guess...<br> I guess I thought...<br> ...it said something about<br> who you were too.<br> I was a girl who was raped,<br> and you were this...<br> ...thing...<br> ...that just kept reminding me of it.<br> Oh, God, I've dreaded this conversation<br> since the day you were born.<br> I don't want any more secrets<br> between us.<br> This one night...<br> ...I was lying in bed...<br> ...and you moved inside me...<br> ...like this tiny little butterfly,<br> just fluttering around in there.<br> And all of a sudden, I realized...<br> I just knew...<br> I knew you weren't his.<br> You were mine.<br> You were my baby.<br> And we were gonna be in it together.<br> Just the two of us.<br> You had nothing to do with that ugliness,<br> you hear me? Nothing.<br> And there's nothing in this world<br> I wouldn't do to be your mom.<br> I should've told you.<br> It's over, isn't it?<br> Not yet.<br> Mr. Sharp, do you know the difference<br> between consensual sex and rape?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> But when you're having a good time<br> like she was...<br> ...ain't no rape. That's for damn sure.<br> Are you a virgin?<br> - No. I ain't a virgin.<br> - Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?<br> She can ask about my client's sexual<br> history, but I can't ask this witness?<br> No, you can't. Sustained.<br> - Why didn't you help her?<br> - Objection.<br> You saw Josey being attacked.<br> Miss Aimes' testimony has not been<br> corroborated by evidence.<br> Neither has his. And my client<br> would like to prove that he's lying.<br> I'm allowing it. For now.<br> Bobby?<br> When you saw Josey being attacked,<br> why didn't you help her?<br> You know, you can use<br> all the lawyer mumbo-jumbo you want...<br> ...this still was no attack.<br> - I asked around about you, Bobby.<br> - Folks say you're kind of soft.<br> - They ain't man enough...<br> ...to say it to my face.<br> - Are you a red-ice player, then?<br> - How's that?<br> - I had a coach used to say:<br> "Win or lose,<br> leave your blood on the ice."<br> Good coach.<br> Yeah.<br> You're what coach would call...<br> ...a yellow-ice player.<br> The kind that wets his pants<br> when things get rough.<br> - Objection. Argumentative.<br> - Denied.<br> She was your friend. You watched him put<br> his filthy hands on her, and you ran away.<br> - It wasn't like that.<br> - Your Honor.<br> - Sustained. Mr. White...<br> - What, he held her down, spread her legs...<br> ...jammed himself up inside her...?<br> - Mr. White!<br> Rangers are hard as steel, huh?<br> Not this one.<br> This one's made of butter.<br> You gonna keep lying about your friend,<br> or you gonna stand up and be a man?<br> - Objection.<br> - I'm not lying.<br> - You wanna run right now, don't you?<br> - Fuck you.<br> - That's enough.<br> - You wanna run?<br> - I didn't run.<br> - Or you gonna put your guts on the ice?<br> What's it gonna be? Yellow?<br> Or red?<br> Yellow or red?<br> - Yellow or red?!<br> - What was I supposed to do?!<br> He was raping her, wasn't he?<br> Yeah.<br> And you ran.<br> What was I supposed to do?<br> What are you supposed to do...<br> ...when the ones with all the power<br> are hurting those with none?<br> Well, for starters, you stand up.<br> You stand up and tell the truth.<br> You stand up...<br> ...for your friends.<br> - Objection, Your Honor.<br> - You stand up...<br> ...even when you're all alone.<br> - You stand up.<br> - All right.<br> - Mr. White, if you are through...<br> - Excuse me.<br> What is going on back there?<br> This is Glory.<br> She worked at Pearson's.<br> She wants to say:<br> "My name is Glory Dodge.<br> And I'm not fucking dead yet.<br> I stand with Josey."<br> - Your Honor?<br> - Your Honor said we needed three plaintiffs.<br> It's still only two.<br> Ready?<br> Yeah!<br> Nice.<br> - Yeah!<br> - Oh, yeah!<br> Hey, your son was just telling me<br> how rich you guys are now.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - You gonna buy me a car?<br> - No. You're not old enough to drive yet.<br> - So?<br> Why are we stopping?<br> Well, if you want a car someday,<br> you gotta know how to drive it, right?<br> First lesson:<br> Driver sits behind the wheel.<br> Come on, move your butt.<br> Seat belt.<br> All right.<br> - What do I do?<br> - Okay.<br> Put your foot on the accelerator.<br> Gently, okay?<br> And stay on the road if you can.<br> Go on, go on.<br> All right. Let's take a tiny<br> little bit at a time. Okay.<br> Slow down.<br> Slow down, racecar driver.<br> There you go. You're a natural.<br>
