                        KNOCKSArretez au coin, s'il vous plait.<br> Monsieur Foine. Yes, monsieur?<br> Could I speak to you for a moment?<br> Well, I've been studying painting<br> with you for some time now.<br> Do you think it's worth my whileWhy do you ask?<br> There's no sense in staying<br> unless I have talent.<br> If you are not certain about<br> your talent, why stay till now?<br> Because all this<br> is so beautiful to me.<br> In my youth,<br> it was also beautiful to me.<br> But now,<br> it is the city of lost illusions.<br> Is your studio very far?<br> No. Not very.<br> Let us go there. You will show me<br> what you have done. Yes.<br> Have you any money?A little. Not enough to live on.<br> Then, I must tell you.<br> There is no talent here, merely<br> industry and intelligence. You will<br> never be anything but mediocre.<br> And it is very cruel<br> to discover one's mediocrity only<br> when it is too late. I know.<br> That name does not belong there.<br> It belongs somewhere else.<br> Take your courage in both your hands<br> and make something of your life.<br> Have you anything in mind?<br> Well, you see...<br> ..I have my limitations. I've always<br> been interested in medicine.<br> If one can't be great, at least<br> one can be of some use to people.<br> WOMAN COUGHS<br> I don't know why I should 'ave such<br> a thing. Upon my word, I don't!<br> I've never had a day's illness<br> in my life.<br> It's a winter cough.<br> Many middle-aged women have it.<br> Well, I never! No-one's<br> ever called me middle-aged before.<br> It's time you got used to it.<br> All the same.<br> You're a nice one, deerie.<br> I can't say the same for you.<br> Good day, madam.<br> The rest of you come back tomorrow.<br> Get him ready.<br> All right, sir.<br> Are you the boy's father? Yes, sir.<br> What's the matter with you now?<br> You see what the matter is.<br> The boy has a club foot.<br> Carey, you'd better take this case.<br> It's a subject<br> you ought to know something about.<br> It's only for the looks of the<br> thing. I don't find it no trouble.<br> That's wonderful. I did. That's cos<br> you let them go on at you.<br> You're a little slow, Carey.<br> I'll instruct the class.<br> There are many varieties of<br> club feet. This is less interesting.<br> Yours would prove more interesting.Yes. I believe so.<br> Mind taking off your sock, Carey?<br> No. Not at all.<br> Keeps his feet nice and clean,<br> doesn't he?<br> Hm, yes. Talipes equinovarus -<br> malformation requiring you to walk<br> on the outside of the foot.<br> A very interesting example,<br> I must say!<br> Do you mind if I have a look?<br> Congenital club foot.<br> In simple language, a foot twisted<br> inward. The cause is not clear.<br> Hereditary influence plays a part.<br> Dr Little traces recurring deformity<br> through four generations.<br> When you've quite finished...<br> I say, old man, I like that!<br> French, isn't she?<br> Yes. She was a model in Paris.<br> I can't, for the life of me,<br> understand why you gave up painting.<br> I'd rather look at that all day<br> long, than at this! Woman, you know!<br> You can tell by the, er, pelvis.I like 'em with a little more...<br> LAUGHTER<br> There's life in the old girl yet!<br> Don't inhale, deerie!<br> I say! I've got to be getting along!<br> A little matter of a barmaid<br> at the Crown & Anchor.<br> Very nice, too! Cheerie-o!<br> Funny fellow, isn't he?<br> It must have been wonderfulIt was.<br> You really knew all thoseSome of them.<br> I wonder if you couldn't help me.In what way?<br> There's a girl<br> and I can't get anywhere with her.<br> You've been to Paris and all that.<br> I'm sure you can give me a starter.<br> I'd ask Griffiths, only he couldn't<br> remember whom he was doing it for.<br> You know,<br> say something to make her laugh.<br> LAUGHS<br> MAN: What? You don't believe it?<br> You are too suspicious!<br> I say, she's marvellous, isn't she?No. She's anaemic.<br> You don't suppose she likesOf course.<br> Now's your chance. Say something.<br> Well, I see your friend's going.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> The nobleman<br> with the sandy moustache.<br> Has he left you for another?<br> Some people would do better<br> to mind their own business.<br> Why?<br> You have a very nice back. Am I<br> on speaking terms with your back?<br> Woman, you know.<br> You can tell by the pelvis.<br> And that...calls himself<br> a gentleman!<br> I apologise. What for?I promised you something charming.<br> She's turned out<br> to be ill-natured and contemptible.<br> You don't suppose I care what<br> an anaemic waitress says to me?<br> Well, I do. I must be going.<br> Coming along?<br> No, I think I'll have some more tea.<br> Anything you want?Yes, if you don't mind.<br> I'd like to talk to you.<br> Filthy weather, isn't it?<br> Makes no difference to me.<br> I have to be here all day.<br> Oh, I only wanted to sayWell, say it.<br> You know, you have a lovely smile.<br> You should use it more often.<br> Now, don't go spoofing me.<br> A girl that works hard all day<br> don't have much reason to smile.<br> Perhaps I could find a reason.<br> Will you let me try?<br> I don't know whether I will<br> or whether I won't.<br> I hope you'll decide you will.<br> Huh!<br> RAIN FALLS<br> KLAXON BLARES<br> Like that, unt that, like so!<br> BOTH LAUGH<br> That is a nice little hand.<br> GLASS CHIMES<br> Excuse me, won't you? Ja ja.<br> THEY GIGGLE<br> How do you do?You seem in a great hurry.<br> I've been waiting ten minutes.<br> I didn't know you could draw!Didn't you?<br> That meant to be me? Looks like you.<br> If you look at it that way. Tea?<br> You are a strange sort.<br> I say, will you dine with me<br> some time? We'll go to the theatre?<br> I don't mind. When will you come?<br> I'm off Thursdays.All right, Thursday,<br> seven o'clock Victoria Station?<br> RINGING<br> All right.

Anyway, you're here,<br> so it's all right, isn't it?<br> You certainly do make a girl<br> feel important.<br> VIOLINS PLAY<br> I love that music.<br> Whenever I hear it, I think of you.<br> How pale you are.<br> How strange, how cold.<br> CORK POPS<br> You ARE going it!<br> Do you always order champagne?<br> No. Why did you do it now?<br> I was hoping it would make you<br> more friendly.<br> Do you think it will? Well,<br> there's one thing I can say for you.<br> Gentleman,<br> in every sense of the word.<br> May I see you again?<br> I don't mind. Doesn't it make<br> any difference to you?<br> No. If you don't take me out,<br> someone else will.<br> I'll say good night here.<br> Won't you stay for a moment? No.Why not?<br> People would think<br> I don't know what.<br> I love that music.<br> Whenever I hear it, I think of you.<br> Whenever I hear it, I think of us.<br> I've never danced with anyone<br> who danced like you.<br> I've been looking for you<br> all my life.<br> You don't have much to do with<br> your time.

It isn't that.I've felt it all along.<br> Foolish.<br> Mind my hat, silly!<br> You ARE clumsy!<br> WHISTLES A TUNE<br> Off your nut! What practice can you<br> expect with a wife like that?<br> I don't know. Let me ask you.<br> Why do you want to marry this girl?<br> Because I'm so in love with her.Aah!<br> That ring with a little design<br> is very popular, sir.<br> We sell a great many of them.<br> They're 30 shillings.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Philip, were you surprised when<br> I asked you to take me to dinner?<br> I was delighted.Were you? Yeah. Why?<br> You've been so sweet to me all day<br> and I've got something to ask you.<br> It makes it so much easier for me.Makes it easier for me, too.<br> I've something to tell you.No, no. Let me tell you first.<br> There it is.<br> I want you to marry me.<br> I'm so sorry, Philip.<br> That's what I was about to tell you.<br> You shouldn't have waited so long.<br> The fact is,<br> I'm going to be married.<br> Are you?<br> To whom?<br> A man I know.<br> He earns very good money.<br> Yes, I'm...I'm sure of it.<br> Now, you won't go on about it,<br> will you, Philip?<br> All right.<br> I'm getting on.<br> I'm 24. Time I settled down.<br> This gentleman earns 7 a week.<br> He's got good prospects.<br> Well, this is goodbye.<br> I hate to eat and run, Philip.<br> I'm going to the theatre with the<br> gentleman that I'm going to marry.<br> MAN: All the latest films<br> of the day...!<br> Taxi.<br> Have you seen her since?<br> No. London is the largest city<br> in the world and you know the cure<br> for ONE woman.<br> Another. Ha ha! Right, ho!<br> Norah, you don't read such junk,<br> do you?<br> No. I write it. What?<br> That's how I earn my living.<br> I didn't know.<br> Successful? Very. I have an immense<br> popularity amongst kitchen maids.<br> They think me so refined.<br> Let's not talk about that.<br> Let's talk about us.<br> Norah, y-you're not really<br> fond of me, are you?<br> For a clever boy,<br> you ask such foolish questions.<br> Oh, my dear. It never struck mePleased?<br> Delighted. And so proud<br> and so happy and so...<br> So grateful.<br> I wish you hadn't been in love<br> with... What was her name?<br> Mildred.<br> Because if she hadn't treated you<br> so abominably<br> it wouldn't have taken you so long<br> to understand how I feel.<br> I saw you! I wasn't very quick!<br> Let's go out and play.<br> Not until you've passed that exam.<br> Tell me, darling.<br> What do you get out of this?<br> You'll never know.<br> I'm afraid you don't get much fun<br> with me.<br> I wish...<br> If only I could take you dancing.<br> I know how you love it.<br> Philip, it's very silly to be<br> so sensitive about your foot.<br> Other people don't think about it<br> as much as you.<br> They notice it when they first<br> see you then forget about it.<br> You know, I only speak of it<br> because I love you.<br> I don't want it to make you unhappy.<br> Now, will you please stay here<br> and go on cramming for that exam?<br> There's a lady to see you, sir.<br> I shouldn't have let her in<br> but she was that upset...<br> Norah!<br> What do you want?<br> I didn't think<br> I'd ever see you again.<br> What's the matter?<br> He's left me. Emile.<br> Oh, has he?<br> Yes.<br> Cos I'm going to have a baby.<br> Why don't you sit down?<br> I suppose you want him back.He'll never come back.<br> Why not? He just won't, that's all.<br> You're his wife.<br> He has to provide for you.<br> He won't give me anything.<br> Even if he did, I wouldn't take it.Why not?<br> No matter what's happened,<br> I've got me pride.<br> That's something, isn't it(?)<br> Have you got any money?<br> No.<br> You'd better get yourself<br> a place to live.<br> After that,<br> we'll see what can be done.<br> Philip, you were always so good<br> to me. I knew I could come to you.<br> Look here, Mr Miller.I?<br> What you expect me to do?Take care of her. You married her.<br> I? I married Mildred? Ach!<br> I married...<br> This one.<br> I'd still like to know<br> what you intend to do.<br> Me? I can do nothing.<br> One man cannot solution the problem<br> of the unmarried mother.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I just couldn't.<br> Well, brace up.<br> Everything will be all right.<br> Philip...<br> Do you still...like me?<br> Really?<br> Strange as it may seem,<br> I always have.<br> I suppose I always shall.<br> I did everything I could<br> to make you love me.<br> I thought you were incapable<br> of loving anybody.<br> It's horrible to think<br> that you were willing to sacrifice<br> everything for that man.<br> I'm awfully sorry, Philip.<br> I shall never forget<br> you wanted to marry me.<br> Philip? Yes?<br> You've been so nice to me...<br> ..I'll do anything you want.<br> Will you? Why?<br> Why, I owe it to you.<br> Oh. Do you?<br> You're not angry.<br> No.<br> Then you'll stay and haveYes, if you want me to.<br> Of course, Philip.<br> Nothing could delight me more.<br> Just a moment<br> and I'll have everything ready.<br> KNOCK ON DOOR<br> Come in.<br> Hello, darling.<br> Norah!<br> How did you happen to come?<br> Just passing by.<br> I wanted to rub my nose<br> against your door.<br> Philip,<br> why haven't I heard from you?<br> I was just going to write.<br> Why haven't you come to see me?<br> Well, I...I've been busy.<br> Why so silent?<br> Well, you see...<br> Norah, I've got something strange<br> to tell you.<br> You've been so good to me,<br> it only makes it harder.<br> Philip, what's wrong?<br> I'm sorry. It's just over.<br> You mean you don't care for me<br> any more?<br> I'm afraid so. What have I done?<br> Nothing.<br> You've been wonderful to me.<br> It's just that I...<br> Of course, I knew you never loved me<br> as much as I loved you.<br> Yes, I'm afraid<br> that's usually the case.<br> There's usually one who loves<br> and one who is loved.<br> Oh, it's always the same.<br> You want a man to be nice to you,<br> you have to be rotten to him.<br> If you treat a man honestly, you...<br> Philip, there's someone else.<br> Yes.<br> Who is she?<br> Mildred.<br> She's come back.<br> After all she's done.<br> How could you?<br> That's what I'd like to know.<br> It's just as though<br> you're bound to her in some way.<br> Yes.<br> As I am to you.<br> And she was to Miller.<br> As every human being is<br> to something or other.<br> Funny looking little thing,<br> isn't it? I can't believe it's mine.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me.<br> So glad it's over, darling.<br> You've been so good to me, Philip.<br> From now on,<br> things will be different.<br> Now, you will take good care of her,<br> won't you?<br> That I will, ma'am.<br> Good day. Good day.<br> I know you don't like it, Philip.<br> I can't do anything elseI suppose not.<br> Be sure and go over on Sundays<br> and see the baby's taken care of.<br> I will.<br> What are we going to do<br> this afternoon?<br> I asked Griffiths to come over.<br> Oh, did you?<br> Why? I know you find him amusing<br> and I'm always afraid of boring you.<br> Hello, hello, hello.<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> Had to get rid of a girl.<br> Why didn't you bring her?I'm not interested in MY girl.<br> I'm interested in other men's girls.<br> D'you like me?<br> LAUGHS<br> Really, I'm too hungry to know.<br> I think I like you lots.<br> I'd like you more if he took us out<br> to dinner. I'd tell you stories.<br> You'll have a wonderful time.<br> What would he do?<br> Ooh, pay the bill.<br> BOTH LAUGH<br> GRIFFITHS AND MILDRED LAUGH<br> I said, "What's that? Your missus?<br> I thought it was your sister!"<br> Oh, allez-up!<br> Allez-up!<br> "Thought it was your sister!"<br> POLITELY: Good night, Philip.<br> FLIRTATIOUSLY: Good night.<br> Just a moment.<br> Are you in love with Mildred?<br> I?<br> LAUGHS<br> That's what you've been<br> so funny about! My dear old boy...<br> Look here. It doesn't matter to you,<br> Harry. You've got so many women.<br> Don't take Mildred away from me.My dear old boy!<br> She's nothing to me at all!<br> Nothing at all!<br> CHUCKLES<br> Do you like it, Philip? Very much.<br> So nice of you to give it to me.<br> What are you thinking about?<br> You were having quite a flirtationI was.<br> Matter of fact, well...<br> I'm sort of in love with him.<br> I'm not surprised!<br> What do you mean? He's good looking,<br> says the things that make you laugh.<br> I'll thank you not to make funI wasn't making fun of you.<br> You don't act as if it's serious.<br> I don't think it is. Why not?<br> Griffiths isn't in love with you.<br> How do you know? I asked him.<br> Would you like to read a letter<br> I got from him this morning?<br> "I've been up all night<br> thinking about you.<br> "I have just sent for a messenger<br> to take this to you in the dawn.<br> "You've no notion of the time<br> I had with your friend last night.<br> "He kept asking me if I love you<br> and of course what could I say?<br> "He'll doubtless tell you all this,<br> "so I'm making sure that you..."<br> Well?<br> Can't help it if I love him, can I?<br> No. I suppose not. Then whatNothing.<br> Only I was fool enough to thinkI do, Philip.<br> As a friend.<br> Not in any other way.<br> But you do care for Griffiths<br> in the other way.<br> But you're cold. That sort of thing<br> doesn't mean anything to you.<br> That's what YOU think.<br> It's no use going on about it,<br> Philip.<br> You said yourself that I couldn't<br> help it if I'm in love with him.<br> If there's anything else to be said,<br> say it.<br> That's a nice dress you have on,<br> Mildred.<br> I couldn't afford it,<br> but I paid for it.<br> You have a nice apartment.<br> I couldn't afford it but I...<br> If you were a gentleman, would you<br> throw what you've done in my face?<br> Do you think it matters to me<br> whether I'm a gentleman or not?<br> If I were, you don't suppose<br> I'd care for a cheap vulgar...<br> I'm sorry, Philip.<br> I didn't want to end this way.<br> Harry's waiting for me.What do you intend to do?<br> We're going to Paris.<br> Get out.<br> Get out!<br> RIPPING<br> SOBBING<br> I've moved three times and each time<br> this woman's hounded me down.<br> I don't like to do this but...<br> All right, sir. I'll move her on.<br> Come on, young lady.<br> You can't stay here. Come on, now.<br> SOBBING<br> Look here, Carey. Mildred and I<br> are all washed up... Too bad.<br> BELL RINGS<br> Excuse me. I'm due in the ward.<br> Anything interesting, Carey?<br> What an unusual name you have.<br> An old Yorkshire name. Once took<br> a day's riding across our estates.<br> And here I am in a charity hospital<br> because my father loved fast women<br> and slow horses.<br> How the mighty are fallen!<br> Hello! Hello, Father.<br> Carey, this is my daughter,<br> christened Maria del Sol.<br> Her mother called her Sally.<br> This young man is a student here.<br> He's been nice to me. With some<br> inducement, he might be nice to YOU.<br> Now, Father. Father's particular<br> genius is saying the wrong thing.<br> He thinks it's fun to embarrass me.<br> It is. Try it some time, Carey.<br> ALTHERNY CHUCKLES<br> I will, if I get the chance.You shall have it!<br> You're coming to see us<br> the first Sunday I am home.<br> Oh, yes. Please do.ALTHERNY CHUCKLES<br> CHILDREN CHATTER AND LAUGH<br> KNIFE SHARPENING<br> What a quaint house!<br> Yes, but it's not very sanitary.Sanitation be hanged! Give me art!<br> I've got nine children<br> and they thrive on bad drains.<br> Look at that, now.I am, with great admiration.<br> Shall I bring the ale, Father?<br> Right, m'girl.<br> The sooner the better.<br> I hope you didn't have the table<br> here on my account.<br> I'd be happy to have dinner<br> with the children.<br> Oh, no. I take meals by myself.<br> I like these antique customs.<br> I don't think women ought<br> to sit down at table with men.<br> CHUCKLING: Why not?It ruins conversation.<br> It's bad for them. Puts ideas<br> in their heads! Women are never<br> at ease when they have ideas.<br> You sound like the voiceI am, sir.<br> This fine Yorkshire pudding<br> gives me strength to carry on.<br> Stop getting up and down<br> every time she comes in.<br> She doesn't want you to make a fuss.<br> She won't think it rude if<br> you sit still. She don't care a hang<br> for chivalry, do you, Sally?<br> No, Father.<br> You speak quietly while eyeing<br> the young man so boldly.<br> Yes, Father.<br> You know what I'm talking about?<br> How could I, darling?<br> You're so clever.<br> Don't stand behind me<br> in order to make eyes at him.<br> Better get Philip some more ale.<br> EXHALES LOUDLY<br> SLURPS, EXHALES<br> My word! Is there anything better<br> than English ale?<br> Let us thank God<br> for simple pleasures -<br> a good appetite,<br> roast beef and beer.<br> I was married to a lady once.<br> Good heavens! Never marry a lady,<br> my boy! Oh, really? Why?<br> Because a lady has a point of view,<br> a personality and an individuality<br> to devil you with.<br> You want a wife who can cook dinner<br> and look after your children.<br> Don't you think so, Sally?<br> I think you'd talk the hind legIt's clean fun.<br> Now, Sally, I'll wait on you.<br> Take my chair while I fetch you<br> and the young man some cheese.<br> Thank you, Father.<br> What do you think of us?<br> You don't know what this means to<br> me. I practically never had family.<br> This is the only place I've known<br> that's had the quality of...home.<br> Don't you think us a little queer?<br> Everyone's queer but me and thee.<br> And sometimes<br> thee is a little queer.<br> Thank you, Father.<br> It's no use mooning over her, Carey.<br> Sally never kisses a gentleman<br> until he's been here twice.<br> Well, you must ask me again,<br> some time.<br> Do it yourself!<br> Why don't you come next Sunday?<br> May I walk to the station with you?<br> No. Why not?<br> It's too late and you're a child.I'm 20.<br> Let's talk it over when you're 30.<br> Did you hear what I said, old man?<br> Yes, I heard. Sorry if I brought<br> up a painful subject.<br> I thought you'd be interested to<br> hear about Mildred. Sorry she's hadI gave her all I could.<br> But you know me, always stony broke.<br> I thought perhaps you'd want to...<br> I can't do anything.Go on.<br> I don't blame you.<br> I wouldn't have told you. She asked<br> me to give you her address.<br> Gave me a jolt, seeing her with that<br> baby, asking for something to eat.<br> She had the baby with her? Yes.<br> Not difficult to imagine<br> her next step.<br> Baby all right?<br> I'm very grateful to you, Philip.<br> If I could afford it, I'd have given<br> you a place of your own.<br> You're welcome to my room.<br> I don't know what would become<br> of me and...baby...<br> if you hadn't taken us in.<br> You'd have got on, I expect.<br> You've always been much nicer<br> to me than I deserved. I'm beginning<br> to realise how silly I've been.<br> You couldn't help how you felt.<br> Let's not talk about it, shall we?<br> I don't feel like that now.<br> Look here, Mildred. Let's have no<br> misunderstanding about this.<br> The reason you're here is... I know.<br> Because you once liked me enough<br> to want to marry me.<br> Yes.<br> Well, at least I can cook for you<br> and keep your flat clean.<br> Maybe some day you'll...<br> you'll feel better about me<br> and things will be like<br> they used to be.<br> Oh, thanks. I'll smoke it later.<br> Well, er... Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Landlady came upstairs<br> a little while ago.<br> She said, "Mrs Carey," she said.<br> "How can you stand it?"<br> What's the matter with them? They're<br> indecent. Disgusting, I calls it.<br> To have drawings<br> of naked people about.<br> If you want to know what I think,<br> I've half a mind to take them down.<br> You'll do nothing of the kind.<br> I love those pictures, Mildred.<br> I love them for what<br> they were meant to be.<br> JAUNTY TUNE BEGINS<br> What happened to it?<br> Hm? What?<br> The way you used to love me.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I was disappointed so often<br> and hurt so much.<br> What difference does it make?<br> Nothing. Only, remember how you got<br> when I was so cold to you?<br> You're getting me that way<br> cos you're so cold to me.<br> No-one else, is there?<br> He's not in love with anybody.<br> Where were you?<br> Altherneys'.<br> What are you doing up?<br> I couldn't sleep.<br> Hadn't you better put on<br> something warmer?<br> Oh, I'll be all right.<br> Just let me stay here.<br> Phil...<br> Phil, I love you so.<br> Oh, nonsense. T'isn't.<br> I can't live without you.<br> Please get up. You're making a fool<br> of yourself and a fool of me.<br> Oh, Phil. Please.<br> I can't go on like this.<br> Nonsense. You haven't anywhere<br> to go. Stay as long as you like.<br> But with the definite<br> understanding...<br> You disgust me.<br> Me?<br> I disgust YOU?<br> You.<br> You!<br> You're too fine!<br> You won't have me but you sit here<br> looking at your naked females!<br> Mildred. You cad!<br> You dirty swine!<br> I never cared for you, not once.<br> I was always making a fool of you.<br> You bored me stiff.<br> It made me sick when I let you kiss<br> me. I did it because you begged me.<br> You drove me crazy!<br> And after you kissed me,<br> I always use to wipe my mouth!<br> Well, I made up for it.<br> For every kiss, we laughed at you.<br> Miller and me, and Griffiths and me.<br> We laughed at you.<br> You were such a mug, a mug, a mug!<br> You gippy-legged monster!<br> You're a cripple! A cripple!<br> You love these things.<br> You love what they were meant to be.<br> Well, here's what<br> they were meant to be!<br> You want to be a doctor!<br> This will take care<br> of your medical school.<br> You're leaving? ..Why?<br> My money's gone.What do you intend to do?<br> Oh... Anything.<br> Before you go out into the world,<br> don't you think we ought<br> to do something about that foot?<br> Think it'll do any good?<br> I'll know better tomorrow.<br> How are you, Philip?I'm all right, Sally.<br> How's your foot? Well...<br> Let's try it, shall we?<br> All right.<br> Careful now.<br> No openings...<br> Sorry, nothing today...<br> All situations filled...<br> No experience? Can't use you...<br> Nothing today...<br> Sorry, no vacancies...<br> No openings...<br> Nothing...<br> Nothing... Nothing... Nothing...<br> Nothing... Nothing...<br> TURNS KEY AND PUSHES DOOR<br> Why haven't you been to see us?Oh, I don't know.<br> I've had things to do.<br> You've been putting on weight.I'm sure you haven't!<br> Why do you say that? The wayOh! That's only my look!<br> It's more than that. I sent you<br> a note and when you didn't answer<br> I went to your room.<br> Your landlady said<br> she had to put you out.<br> Hello, Philip!<br> My dear fellow, by pre-arranged<br> signal, my daughter communicated to<br> me confirmation of our suspicions.<br> As you know, I've been on the beach<br> most of my life.<br> In Tahiti, I was President<br> of the Beachcombers' Union!<br> I would like to enquire<br> into your amateur standing.<br> Where have you been staying?<br> Oh...anywhere.Why didn't you come here?<br> False modesty, I suppose.<br> Now, stop being an Englishman.<br> When a man's on his uppers,<br> it's time he came down to Earth.<br> We want you here with us. Well, I...<br> Thanks very much, but... You're<br> to stay until you get your bearings.<br> I want no more fine talk about it.<br> It's all arranged.<br> Well...<br> Well, here goes my amateur standing.<br> I-I really have no place to go.<br> It's awfully good of you. Nonsense!<br> The house is completely unsanitary.<br> You'll wind up with some<br> foul disease! Let him alone, Father.<br> I want to talk to him.I suppose youth must be served.<br> But I'm sick and tired<br> of serving it. Nine of them!<br> Will that do?<br> Looks as if it might.<br> Wouldn't be a nice night to be out.<br> Not really. No. It's going to be<br> jolly having you here.<br> I hope I shan't have to stay<br> very long. Why?<br> I can't go on like this, you know.<br> I need a job.<br> Father and I discussed that.There isn't much you've overlooked.<br> I'll have to sew that on, too.<br> And Father has a job for you.<br> Has he? Where? Where he works.<br> You're walking all right now.<br> I saw you in the window.<br> I never thought you'd come to that.<br> COUGHS SHARPLY<br> You're very hoarse. Throat sore?<br> You haven't forgotten<br> your doctoring, have you? No.<br> Because...that's what I want<br> to see you about.<br> Why not go to a doctor?<br> There's the Free Hospital.All them students staring at me?<br> COUGHS<br> What seems to be the trouble?Well, I cough all the time.<br> Let's have a look at your throat.<br> Phil.<br> It's not...me lungs, is it?<br> SOBS GENTLY<br> Where's the baby?<br> She died last summer.<br> Oh.<br> You might say you're sorry.I'm not. I'm very glad.<br> I'm afraid I can't help you much.<br> Don't leave me, Philip.<br> I know I've treated you shocking.<br> But don't leave me. Not yet, please.<br> There's no-one I can go to.<br> You're the only one that treated me<br> like I was human.<br> You're a gentleman, Philip.<br> The only one I've ever met.<br> COUGHS<br> Some things you'll need.<br> Our last day.<br> Why, Sally!<br> Darling.<br> I was so determined<br> not to let you see.<br> Well, that's sweet of you<br> to care because I'm going away.<br> I suppose I'm a fool to care,<br> but it doesn't mean you have to do<br> anything about it.<br> You can't help it because someone<br> loves you and you don't love back.<br> Sally, look at me.<br> Darling, do you think you'll always<br> feel like this about me?<br> Yes.<br> I've known it since the first time<br> you came to our house.<br> I thought at first that<br> I meant something to you, too.<br> Oh, but you did.<br> You do.<br> When I come back, if you feel the<br> same, will you marry me, darling?<br> Don't you mean if YOU feel the same?<br> VOICES SHOUT AND ARGUE OUTSIDE<br> This is what you might call<br> the irony of fate.<br> Come on now. Be quick.<br> Get her out of here.<br> I don't want the likes of her<br> on me hands.<br> I understand there's an interestingDon't go in there.<br> Why not?<br> If you please...

I'm not going.<br> What's that?<br> My wedding present to my wife.<br> When do you intend to marry me?<br> Right away.<br> Thank you, Philip.<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> You don't seem very pleased.<br> Well, I am and I'm not.<br> Why? I'm afraid<br> it's only a noble gesture.<br> That's not enough for marriage.No, Sally.

No, thanks.<br> I had to be free to realise that,<br> free to understand that all those<br> years I dreamed of escape was<br> because I was limping through life.<br> Taxi, sir? No, thank you!<br> And because I was bound up with<br> a person who was incredible to me.<br> That's all over.<br> I'm not limping any more. My life's<br> all right. Then why don't you go?<br> Because everything that's beautiful<br> to me is right here.<br> Won't you please marry me, Sally?<br> If you like. But don't you want to?<br> Well, there's no-one else I'd marry.<br> How about a taxi, sir?<br> What? How about a taxi?<br> Yes.<br>
