You think I'd let you<br> carry your own work card?<br> I thought I had it in my own pocket.<br> What did you take out of that pocket?<br> There's nothing in the pocket, George.<br> I know it ain't. You got it in your hand.<br> Now, what you got in your hand?<br> George, that's just my mouse.<br> But I didn't kill it, George.<br> Honest, I found it dead.<br> Oh, jeez.<br> - Give it here.<br> - George, leave me have it.<br> Give it here.

About 10,000, 12,000 feet.<br> How do you like your pup, Lennie?<br> I like that puppy.

I'd drink it myself if I had.<br> I ain't got no gut ache.<br> Come here.<br> God Almighty,<br> that dog of yours stinks, Candy.<br> He's got no teeth.<br> He's all stiff from rheumatism.<br> He ain't no good to ya.<br> Hell, he ain't no good to hisself.<br> Why don't you just shoot him, Candy?<br> Well!<br> I couldn't do that.<br> I had him too long.<br> I herded sheep with him.<br> That poor old dog<br> just suffers hisself all the time.<br> No. No.<br> Look.<br> Take him out and shoot him<br> right in the back of the head.<br> Right there.<br> Hell, he'd never even know what hit him.<br> Aw...<br> I couldn't do that.<br> I had him too long.<br> I'll shoot him for ya.<br> Then it won't be you that done it.<br> - No.<br> - Slim's bitch has got a litter right now.<br> I'll bet you Slim would give you<br> one of her pups to raise.<br> Sure. You can have<br> any one of them pups you want.<br> No, no, no.<br> Carlson's right, Candy.<br> That dog ain't no good to hisself.<br> Hey, Slim. Read this.<br> "Dear Editor, I read your magazine<br> for six years. It's the best in the market."<br> "I like stories by Peter Rand."<br> - What you want me to read that for?<br> - Go on. Read the name at the bottom.<br> - "Yours for success, William Tanner."<br> - You met Bill Tanner?<br> Yeah. Bald-headed guy,<br> drove a cultivator.<br> That's him.<br> Candy, if you want me to, I'll put<br> that old dog out of his misery right now.<br> Won't hurt him at all.<br> - Let's wait till tomorrow.<br> - I don't see why. Let's get it over with.<br> We can't sleep<br> with that stinking dog in here.<br> All right.<br> Take him.<br> Come on, boy. Come on.<br> He won't even feel it.<br> Come on, boy. Come on.<br> Carlson...<br> - Get a shovel.<br> - Yeah.<br> Candy.<br> You can have any one<br> of them pups you want.<br> Uh... Does anybody<br> wanna play a little rummy?<br> Yeah.<br> You deal.<br> Hey, hey.<br> Hey, hey.<br> - Slim?<br> - Yeah.<br> I can't keep up with that guy. It'll kill me.<br> All right.<br> - Jack!<br> - Yeah.<br> Take Mike's place.<br> - Aw, Slim.<br> - Just for a while.<br> Mike, you take Jack's place.<br> You're on there.<br> So how long you and Lennie<br> been together, George?<br> A long time. A real long time.<br> Really? Seems kinda funny,<br> you two traveling around together.<br> What's funny about it?<br> Well, a cuckoo like him<br> and a smart guy like you.<br> Well, I ain't so smart or I wouldn't be<br> bucking barley for my 50 bucks a month.<br> I guess you're right.<br> How'd you two meet up?<br> Well, I knew his Aunt Clara.<br> She took him when he was a boy.<br> She raised him up.<br> When she died,<br> Lennie just come along with me working.<br> Uh-huh.<br> I used to play jokes on him cos he's<br> too damn dumb to take care of himself.<br> He'd do any damn thing I told him.<br> Put that on back in here.<br> One day, a bunch of guys standing<br> around on the Sacramento River,<br> I turns to him and<br> I says "Jump in, Lennie."<br> And he jumps.<br> Couldn't swim a stroke. He damn near<br> drowned before we could get to him.<br> He was so damn nice to me for pulling<br> him out, he forgot I told him to jump in.<br> He's a nice fella.<br> A guy don't need no sense<br> to be a nice fella.<br> Yeah.<br> He gets in trouble all the time<br> cos he's so goddamn dumb.<br> Like what happened up north in Weed.<br> What'd he do in Weed?<br> He seen this girl,<br> in a red dress,<br> and the dumb bastard that he is, he just...<br> He wants to touch everything he likes,<br> so he reaches out to touch this red dress.<br> So the girl starts screaming,<br> and that gets Lennie all mixed up,<br> so he holds on and he won't let go,<br> cos that's the only thing<br> he can think to do.<br> So what happened?<br> Well, she runs off<br> across the field, screaming.<br> So me and Lennie take off running.<br> Pretty soon we hear a bunch of<br> guys with dogs coming after us.<br> Had to hide in the irrigation ditch<br> until it was safe to get away.<br> He didn't hurt the girl none?<br> Hell, no. He just scared her.<br> Well... he ain't mean.<br> I can tell a mean guy a mile off.<br> Milton!<br> I ain't payin' you to stand around.<br> - Get back to work.<br> - He just come over for a drink of water.<br> You get back to work. You get<br> these men moving. They're way behind.<br> You men get moving here. Let's go.<br> Goddamnit, stop that racket!<br> Lennie.<br> I told you not to bring that pup in here.<br> I ain't got no pup.<br> - Any of you boys seen my wife?<br> - She ain't been here.<br> - Where the hell's Slim?<br> - Went out to the barn.<br> Carlson, do you think he's gonna find<br> Slim in the barn with his wife?<br> Better not tangle with Slim.<br> Curley's lookin' for a fight.<br> I gotta see this. Come on.<br> No, I'll stay here. Thanks.<br> - Was Curley's wife in the barn?<br> - If she was, I didn't see her.<br> George.<br> Both the ends is the same.<br> - Why both the ends is the same?<br> - It's just the way they make 'em.<br> You sure she didn't come in the barn,<br> like she come in here?<br> No, she never.<br> Give me a good whorehouse every time.<br> A guy can go in, get drunk,<br> get it all out of his system<br> all at once, and no messes.<br> - George.<br> - Yeah?<br> How long is it gonna be<br> till we get the little place<br> and live off the fat of the land?<br> Gotta get some money together first.<br> I know a little place where you can get<br> cheap, but they ain't giving it away.<br> Tell about that place.<br> It's ten acres.<br> It's got a windmill. Got a little shack<br> on it, and a chicken run.<br> Got rabbits, George?<br> I could easily build a few hutches<br> and you could feed 'em alfalfa.<br> You're damn right.<br> You're goddamn right I could.<br> But, George, tell about the house.<br> Well, we have a little house,<br> and we have a room to ourself.<br> And we have a little, fat, iron stove, and<br> in the winter we keep a fire going in it.<br> And rabbits, George. And that... But<br> I tend 'em. How do I tend them rabbits?<br> Well, you go out to the alfalfa field.<br> You have a sack.<br> You fill up that sack and you bring it<br> in and you put it in the rabbit cage.<br> You have a few pigeons<br> that fly around the windmill,<br> like they done when I was a kid.<br> And it'd be our home.<br> Nobody could can us.<br> We don't like a guy,<br> we just say "Get the hell out."<br> If a friend come, we'd have an extra bunk.<br> We'd say "Why don't you spend<br> the night?" and, by God, he would.<br> We'd have a dog and a couple of cats,<br> but you got to make sure<br> them cats don't get them rabbits.<br> But... you just let them try.<br> I'm gonna break them goddamn cats'<br> necks. I smash them cats with a stick.<br> You know a place like this?<br> Suppose I do. What's it to you?<br> How much they want for a place like that?<br> - Could get it for 600 bucks.<br> - 600.<br> Old people that owns it is broke.<br> I ain't much good with only one hand.<br> That's why they give me a job sweeping.<br> And they give me $250 cos I lost my hand.<br> And I got 50 more saved<br> in the bank right now.<br> That's, uh... 300.<br> And I got 50 more coming<br> at the end of the month.<br> Suppose I went in with you fellas.<br> That'd be $350 that I'd put in.<br> Now, let me tell you something.<br> I could cook,<br> and I could tend the chickens,<br> and I could hoe in the garden. Huh?<br> - Now, how would that be?<br> - OK.<br> I got to think about that.<br> We was gonna do it by ourselves.<br> We were gonna do it by ourselves.<br> Well, now, wait a minute.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> I'd make a will and leave my share<br> to you guys in case I kick off.<br> I ain't got no relatives or nothin'.<br> You fellas got any money?<br> Maybe we can do it now.<br> - We got ten bucks between us.<br> - We got ten bucks.<br> - Ten bucks.<br> - Yeah.<br> You seen what they done to my dog?<br> They said he wasn't no good no more.<br> I wish somebody'd shoot me<br> when I ain't no good,<br> but they won't do that.<br> They'll can me, and I ain't<br> gonna have no place to go.<br> Look, if me and Lennie work a month<br> and we don't spend nothin',<br> we'll have 100 bucks.<br> And you got 350?<br> Yeah, and you can have every cent of it.<br> That'd be 450.<br> Jesus Christ, I bet we could get it for that.<br> You two could get her started.<br> I'd work and make up the rest.<br> I'm gonna take that goddamn pup.<br> Sure, sure, sure.<br> You know what I'm gonna do?<br> I'll write those two old people<br> that we'll take it.<br> Candy will send $100 to hold it?<br> I sure will. I'll have 30 more dollars<br> the time you guys is ready to quit.<br> I get to tend the rabbits.<br> Tell him, George. Tell him he can't do it.<br> I'll get to hoe in the garden,<br> even if I ain't no good at it?<br> - They got a nice stove there?<br> - Yeah, yeah. They got a real nice stove!<br> But I bet that pup will like it there.<br> We're gonna do it, goddamnit. We can fix<br> up that little old place and live there.<br> When we gonna do it?<br> One month. Right smack in one month.<br> Now, don't tell nobody about it.<br> - Just us three and nobody else.<br> - Don't tell nobody.<br> George, I ought to have<br> shot that dog myself.<br> I should not let no stranger shoot my dog.<br> - Shut up. I'm tired of...<br> - I just asked you!<br> You've been asking me too often<br> and I'm damn sick of it.<br> If you can't look after<br> your goddamn wife,<br> what do you expect me<br> to do about it, huh?<br> - Lay off me.<br> - Didn't mean nothing by it.<br> - I said lay off.<br> - Just thought you might have seen her.<br> - Tell her to stay home.<br> - You keep out of this.<br> You goddamn punk.<br> You're yellow as a frog belly.<br> You may be the best welterweight<br> in the country,<br> but I'll kick your goddamn head in.<br> What the hell you laughing about?<br> Huh? You!<br> Come on, you big bastard, get up.<br> No big son of a bitch<br> is gonna laugh at me. Get up.<br> - I'll show you who's yellow.<br> - You got no cause for...<br> Get up!<br> - Come on, Curley!<br> - Get up and fight.<br> - He didn't do nothing. Leave him alone.<br> - I didn't.<br> Cut it out, Curley.<br> - Fight back.<br> - Make him stop.<br> Get him, Lennie.<br> Get him, Lennie! Get him!<br> Get him off of me! Get him off of me!<br> Lennie.<br> Slim, help me.<br> - Lennie.<br> - Oh, God!<br> Lennie! Lennie!<br> Lennie! Let go!<br> Lennie! Let go of his hand.<br> Let go.<br> Jesus.<br> You told me to, George. You told me to.<br> I know, I know.<br> Take it easy now. Calm down.<br> We gotta get him to a doctor.<br> Carlson, get the wagon hitched up. We'll<br> take him into Soledad to get him fixed up.<br> I didn't wanna hurt him.<br> I didn't wanna hurt him.<br> I know. I know.<br> It ain't your fault, Lennie.<br> This punk had it coming to him.<br> Slim, is Curley's old man<br> gonna can us now?<br> Hey, you hear me?<br> Huh? Hey!<br> - You hear me?<br> - Huh?<br> I think you got your hand<br> caught in a machine.<br> Now, if you don't tell nobody<br> what happened, we ain't going to.<br> But you just tell,<br> and try to get this guy canned,<br> we're gonna tell everybody<br> what really happened.<br> - You got that? Huh?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> George, you and Whitt,<br> give me a hand. Come on.<br> Lift him up. That's it.<br> Candy, get the door.<br> Whitt, you go on into town with Carlson.<br> George.<br> Jesus, you look like hell.<br> Do... do I still get to tend the rabbits?<br> Sure, you ain't done nothing wrong.<br> Thanks a lot. I didn't want no trouble.<br> It's all right. I know you didn't.<br> Come on. You be quiet<br> so I can clean you up. OK?<br> OK?<br> Hi, boys.<br> It's hot out here. Not cool like in the barn.<br> I said it's hot out here!<br> Why don't you go back to your house<br> now? We don't want no trouble.<br> I ain't giving you no trouble.<br> Think I don't like to talk<br> to somebody every once in a while?<br> You got a husband. Go talk to him.<br> Sure, I got a husband.<br> Swell guy, ain't he?<br> Say, what happened to Curley's hand?<br> He got his hand caught in a machine.<br> Baloney! What you think<br> you're selling me?<br> How'd you get them bruises on your face?<br> - Who, me?<br> - Yeah, you.<br> Got his hand caught in a machine.<br> Yeah, OK.<br> Lennie.<br> I'm gonna go into town with the guys.<br> - Can I stay here?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Just stay here for a while<br> and then go back to the bunkhouse.<br> OK.<br> Come on, George.<br> Don't you get in no trouble.<br> You ain't got no right<br> to come into my room.<br> Ain't nobody got a right<br> to be in here but me.<br> - I... I seen your light.<br> - Yeah, well, I got a right to have a light.<br> Now, I ain't wanted in those bunkhouses<br> and you ain't wanted in my room.<br> - Why ain't you wanted?<br> - Because I'm black.<br> They say I stink. Well, I'll tell you,<br> all of y'all stink to me.<br> Everybody went into town.<br> - Well, what you want?<br> - Nothing. I see... I...<br> I seen your light.<br> Well, come on in and sit awhile if you<br> won't get out of here and leave me alone.<br> Goddamn your soul.<br> All the boys go into town?<br> All but old Candy. He just sat in<br> the bunkhouse, figuring about the rabbits.<br> What rabbits you talkin' about?<br> The rabbits we're gonna get,<br> and I get to tend 'em.<br> You're nuts. You're crazy as a wedge.<br> I don't blame that guy you travel with<br> for keeping you out of sight.<br> No, every word is the truth.<br> You can ask George.<br> You travel around with George, don't you?<br> Sure. Me and George<br> go everywhere together.<br> And sometimes he talk to you<br> and you don't understand<br> what the hell he's talking about.<br> Ain't that so?<br> How long do you think it's gonna be<br> before them puppies are old enough<br> to take away from its mother?<br> Boy, I tell you.<br> A guy can talk to you and be sure<br> you ain't gonna go blabbing. Uh-uh!<br> Just talking<br> and you don't understand nothing.<br> It don't make no difference if you<br> don't hear or understand, you just...<br> ...talking.<br> Just talking.<br> Just being with another guy.<br> That's all.<br> Suppose...<br> George don't come back no more.<br> What you do then?<br> What?<br> I said suppose George<br> go into town tonight<br> and you never heard of him no more.<br> George would never do nothing like that.<br> Well, suppose he get hurt<br> or killed and he can't come back.<br> George can't get killed<br> cos George is careful.<br> Well, just suppose. Suppose he don't<br> come back. What you do then?<br> I don't know.<br> Gee, why are you doing anyways?<br> - That ain't true. George ain't hurt.<br> - Shall I tell you what'd happen?<br> They'd take you to the booby hatch<br> and lock you up with a collar, like a dog.<br> - Who'll hurt George?<br> - Just supposin'.<br> George ain't hurt. He's all right.<br> He's gonna come back.<br> - Then what you supposing for?<br> - Oh, I...<br> Ain't nobody talk no hurt to George.<br> Just keep calm.<br> Now, now, George ain't hurt.<br> Ain't nobody talk no hurt<br> to George. George'll be back.<br> All right, all right, all right. Just sit down.<br> Calm down.<br> Go on.<br> Maybe you can see now.<br> You got George.<br> Suppose you ain't got nobody.<br> Suppose you can't go into the bunkhouse<br> and play rummy because you's black.<br> Suppose you have to sit out here<br> with the mules and read books.<br> Books ain't no good.<br> A guy goes nuts, he ain't got nobody.<br> I tell ya, a guy gets too lonely,<br> he gets sick.<br> Maybe George come back already.<br> Maybe I better go see.<br> I... I didn't mean to scare you.<br> George gonna come back all right.<br> I was just talking about myself, that's all.<br> We're gonna get a little place of land<br> and rabbits and windmill.<br> You're nuts.<br> Lennie!<br> - That's George. George is back.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm in here, George.<br> You shouldn't be in here.<br> Yeah, well, I told him,<br> but he come on in anyway.<br> - Why didn't you kick him out?<br> - Well, I...<br> I guess I didn't care much.<br> Come on.<br> Night.<br> George, I thought<br> you were gonna stay in town.<br> - Well, why'd you think that?<br> - That nigger told me.<br> He tell you got hurt.<br> Hey!<br> Did you see Curley in town?<br> No.<br> He went into town.<br> His old man went into town, too.<br> Yeah.<br> I couldn't even play my records tonight.<br> I got no records left. I had four.<br> "Am I Blue", "Little by Little", "Button Up<br> Your Overcoat" and "Ten Cents a Dance".<br> Curley got mad at me after supper,<br> broke all my records.<br> I know how you got them bruises<br> on your face.<br> And how Curley got his hand busted.<br> He got his hand caught in a machine.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> If you say so.<br> Someday I'm going into town,<br> and no one's ever gonna see me again.<br> Not Curley, not his old man,<br> not a damn one of you bindle stiffs!<br> George, she's crying.<br> George, why is she crying?<br> I don't know.<br> - I finished the letter.<br> - Oh, that's good. Good, that's good.<br> Maybe we should send<br> the binding money?<br> No, no. Let's wait<br> till we hear back from 'em.<br> - Well, I hope they ain't already sold it.<br> - Oh, don't you worry about that.<br> George, I'll tell you what. I'd feel<br> a lot better sending the money now.<br> Well, let me think about it.<br> You know, I could hardly sleep last night,<br> thinking about us getting that farm.<br> We'll be there before you know it.<br> Come on, Crooks, put it in.<br> Oh, good shot.<br> That's the way.<br> Still in there.<br> Why did you get killed?<br> You ain't seen so little as the mice.<br> George is never gonna let me tend<br> my rabbits if he finds out you got killed.<br> Come on, George.<br> Put that ringer on.<br> One of 'em got very close.<br> - OK, Slim, come on.<br> - Shut up, Smiley.<br> - Ringer time.<br> - Ringer time.<br> What you got there, sonny boy?<br> George says I ain't got<br> nothing to do with you.<br> George giving you orders<br> about everything?<br> I ain't gonna talk to you or nothing.<br> The guys got<br> a horseshoe tournament going on.<br> None of them guys is gonna leave.<br> Why can't I talk to you?<br> I never get to talk to nobody.<br> I get awful lonely.<br> I ain't supposed to talk to you.<br> You can talk to people,<br> but I can't talk to nobody but Curley,<br> or else he gets mad.<br> How'd you like not to talk to anybody?<br> What you got covered up there?<br> I...<br> That's the pup.<br> That's the little pup.<br> Why, it's dead.<br> But I was just playin' with him.<br> Don't you worry none.<br> He's just a mutt.<br> You can get another one, easy.<br> Well, it ain't that so much, but George<br> ain't gonna let me tend them rabbits now.<br> - Why don't he?<br> - Well, he said when...<br> I did any bad things, then I wouldn't<br> be able to tend them rabbits.<br> Don't you worry about talking to me.<br> Listen to the guys yell.<br> They ain't gonna leave till it's over.<br> I ain't supposed to talk to you. George<br> said he'd give me hell. He told me this.<br> Well, what's the matter with me?<br> Ain't I got a right to talk to nobody?<br> George says you get<br> the people in a mess.<br> Oh, nuts.<br> What kinda harm am I doing to you?<br> I tell ya, I ain't used to living like this.<br> I could've made something outta myself.<br> Maybe I will yet.<br> A show come through Salinas,<br> and I met one of the actors.<br> He says I could go with the show.<br> My old lady wouldn't let me,<br> but this guy says I coulda.<br> If I went, I wouldn't be<br> living like this. You bet.<br> Say, we were supposed to get<br> a little place and then get rabbits.<br> Another time, I met a guy -<br> he was in the pictures.<br> Went out to the<br> Riverside Dance Palace with him.<br> He says he was gonna put me<br> in the movies.<br> He says I was a natural.<br> As soon as he got back to Hollywood<br> he was gonna write to me about it.<br> I never did get that letter.<br> I always thought my old lady stole it, too.<br> She said no.<br> So, um... I married Curley.<br> Met him out at the Riverside Dance Palace<br> that same night.<br> - Are you listenin'?<br> - Sure.<br> I ain't told this to nobody before.<br> And maybe I oughtn't to.<br> I don't like Curley.<br> He ain't a nice fella.<br> I could've been in the movies.<br> Had nice clothes.<br> This guy said I was a natural.<br> Maybe if you took this pup<br> and you throwed him away,<br> then George would never know and I'd<br> get to tend them rabbits with no trouble.<br> What makes you so nuts about rabbits?<br> I like to pet nice things<br> with the fingers.
