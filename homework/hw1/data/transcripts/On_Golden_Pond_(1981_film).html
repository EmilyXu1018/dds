                        Norman!<br> Come here. Come here.<br> Norman!<br> Hurry up!<br> The loons.<br> The loons.<br> They're welcoming us back.<br> I don't hear a thing.<br> Just look at this place.<br> It's a mess, isn't it?<br> Just take a second.<br> It'll be all shipshape again.<br> And warmer.<br> Huh.<br> The phone works!<br> At least I think it does.<br> Hello?<br> Hello! Hello!<br> Who the hell is that?<br> Who the hell's<br> in this picture here?<br> Who the hell is this?<br> Hello! Who's this?<br> The operator?<br> What do you want?<br> Well, you called.<br> Must want somethin'.<br> Oh, wait a minute.<br> I did call you, but you never answered.<br> Well, how are ya?<br> Well, how nice.<br> Listen, this is Norman Thayer, Jr.,<br> over on Golden Pond.<br> I have somethin' I want you to do.<br> Call me up. Can ya do that?<br> Yeah, I want to check my phone,<br> see if it still rings.<br> Haven't rung all winter.<br> It may have lost its "whatsee."<br> You got my number?<br> I have no idea.<br> It's got a nine in it, is all I know.<br> It's in the book.<br> You must have a book.<br> Norman Thayer, Jr.<br> Let's give her a try, shall we?<br> Who the hell is that?<br> - Someone's at the door.<br> - It's me, you old poop!<br> Well, look at you.<br> Yeah, look at me?<br> Quite a sight, aren't I?<br> Oh, Norman! It's so beautiful.<br> Everything's just waking up.<br> Little, tiny birds.<br> Little, tiny leaves.<br> I saw a patch of little, tiny flowers<br> over by the old cellar hole.<br> I forget what they're called.<br> Little, tiny, yellow things.<br> Well, want to help me<br> with the dustcovers?<br> - I don't have anything else to do.<br> - Come on.<br> What were you doin'<br> out in the woods?<br> Norman, what do you think I was doing?<br> I was getting wood.<br> Hey, I met<br> the nicest couple.<br> - Yeah? Where?<br> - In the woods.<br> - Couple of people?<br> - No, a couple of antelope.<br> Of course<br> a couple of people.<br> Their name is Migliori, I believe.<br> Migliori?<br> What sort of a name is that?<br> I don't know, darling. Italian, I suppose.<br> They're up from Boston.<br> - They speak English?<br> - Well, of course they speak English.<br> They're a nice middle-aged<br> couple, just like us.<br> If they're just like us,<br> they're not middle-aged.<br> - Of course they are.<br> - Middle-aged means the middle, Ethel.<br> Middle of life.<br> People don't live to be 150!<br> Well, we're at the far edge<br> of middle age. That's all.<br> We're not, you know. We're not middle-aged.<br> You're old, and I'm ancient.<br> Oh, pooh!<br> - You're in your 70s, and I'm in my 60s.<br> - Just barely on both counts.<br> Would you like to spend the rest<br> of the afternoon quibbling about this?<br> - We can, if you like.<br> - Oh, for the Lord's sake.<br> The Miglioris, whatever their age group,<br> have invited us to have dinner sometime.<br> Wouldn't that be nice?<br> I don't know. I'm not sure my stomach's<br> ready for rigatoni, that sort of thing.<br> Oh, no! Poor Elmer!<br> He's had a terrible fall.<br> Poor little Elmer.<br> The life you've led.<br> He was my first true love,<br> you know.<br> Known all along<br> I wasn't the first in line.<br> No, you were a rather<br> cheap substitute for Elmer.<br> - And now he's had a fall.<br> - Maybe he wanted to kill himself.<br> Maybe he wanted to be cremated.<br> Probably got cancer or termites or something.<br> - Shut up, Norman!<br> - Not a bad way to go, huh?<br> Quick front flip off the mantle,<br> end up in the fire. Nothin' to it.<br> - Norman, will you shut up?<br> - When my number's up, do that for me.<br> Prop me up on the mantle,<br> point out which way is down.<br> Might even try for a full gainer<br> with a half twist.<br> Norman Thayer, Jr., your fascination with dying<br> is beginning to frazzle my good humor.<br> Not fascination.<br> Just crosses my mind now and then.<br> Every five minutes. Don't you have<br> anything else to think about?<br> Nothing quite<br> as interesting.<br> Well, what's stopping you? Why don't<br> you take your dive and get it over with?<br> And leave you alone with Elmer?<br> You must be mad!<br> Oh, for pity's sake.<br> Come on and help me get<br> the canoe off the porch.<br> - Norman, are you paddling?<br> - Of course I'm paddling.<br> Then you're not steering.<br> You want me to take the stern?<br> I most certainly do not.<br> - Norman!<br> - God, what is it?<br> Look! Look! Oh, look,<br> I've spotted the loons!<br> Oh! Oh, they're so lovely.<br> Here. Here.<br> Look.<br> - Can you see them?<br> - No.<br> - Oh.<br> - Oh! Oh, my goodness. There they are.<br> - Oh, they're so beautiful.<br> - Yeah, they're huge.<br> I never saw such big loons<br> in my life.<br> Those are boats, you poop.<br> Come in closer.<br> A husband and wife.<br> I think they're<br> looking at us.<br> Yeah, they are.<br> What the hell's<br> the matter with them?<br> Hey, buzz off!<br> - Buzz off!<br> - Ethel, what are you doing?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Don't do that.<br> - Why not? You did it.<br> - Never mind. I'll explain later.<br> Five, six, seven, eight,<br> nine, ten, eleven.<br> How about that?<br> Right on your man.<br> - Where were you?<br> - Where was I?<br> - Oh, come off it. Don't give me that.<br> - Five...<br> Six, seven,<br> eight, nine, ten...<br> - Damn!<br> - Eleven. Yes.<br> Good night, sweet prince.<br> Five, 10, 15 and 20.<br> Well, Mother!<br> You want to stay here and watch<br> the boat while I run into the store?<br> I think I'm qualified<br> to watch the boat.<br> - Come with me, if you want to.<br> - No, thank you very much.<br> - Okay. Hello, Sumner.<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Thayer.<br> - Will you fill her up, please? Norman will help you.<br> - Sure.<br> That'll be $38,<br> please, Mr. Thayer.<br> Good God. You know how much gasoline<br> cost when I was your age?<br> Twelve cents a gallon.<br> Is that a fact?<br> I didn't even know they had gas back then.<br> What are ya,<br> a couple of nitwits?<br> Think it's funny being old?<br> My whole goddamn body's<br> fallin' apart!<br> Sometimes I can't even<br> go to the bathroom when I want to...<br> but I'm still a man<br> and can take on you punks.<br> Norman! Here we go.<br> Thanks, boys.<br> I'll drive home.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> If I make the wrong turn and wind up<br> in Michigan, be sure you let me know.<br> - Someone's at the door.<br> - It's me, you old poop!<br> - Where have you been?<br> - Picking strawberries.<br> There were oodles and oodles<br> of little strawberries along the old town road.<br> How nice.<br> What you are doing in here<br> on a morning like this is beyond me!<br> I've been quite busy looking through<br> yesterday's paper for gainful employment.<br> - Here we go again.<br> - Very good prospects, I think.<br> Chauffeurs, yard work.<br> Dairy Divine wants<br> an ice-cream dipper.<br> I think I could do something<br> like that, don't you?<br> What are you gonna do if you call<br> and they say, "Come on over and start tomorrow"?<br> - Go on over and start tomorrow.<br> - Oh, for the love of God!<br> What on earth's<br> the matter with you?<br> Give me that stuff.<br> Take these buckets and pick us<br> another quart of strawberries.<br> And I'll fix us up a scrumptious<br> strawberry shortcake for lunch. Go on.<br> You want me to<br> pick strawberries?<br> Yep. Do I have to put<br> an ad in the paper?<br> - I'm not sure I know how.<br> - It's really very simple. You bend over and pick 'em.<br> - Bend over? Where are they?<br> - On the ground, where they belong.<br> Last time we picked blueberries they were<br> on a bush. Didn't have to bend over at all.<br> These are strawberries,<br> and they grow on the ground.<br> Here comes what's-his-name.<br> He'll have the paper.<br> I don't want to miss any career opportunities<br> off lookin' for strawberries.<br> I'll pay you. It may be<br> the beginning of something big.<br> You may become<br> a major strawberry picker.<br> Not if I'm bending over all the time.<br> I think you're tryin' to kill me.<br> I thought about it.<br> You needn't bother.<br> I'm living on borrowed time as it is.<br> Will you take your cheery personality<br> and get out of here?<br> I hope you're prepared to massage<br> my bent back this evening.<br> With pleasure.<br> Well, maybe I can lie down<br> to pick the berries.<br> Mornin', Ethel!<br> Hi, Charlie. Come on up and have<br> some coffee. You can take five minutes.<br> You got a letter<br> from Chelsea!<br> - The rest is just bills and junk like that.<br> - Go on in.<br> Gee!<br> Oh! Uh-oh.<br> I think I broke your door.<br> No, no. It's been that way<br> for months now.<br> Norman's supposed to fix it, but I'm afraid<br> it's not high on his list of priorities.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Hi, Norman.<br> Norman, are you back already?<br> You barely left.<br> So? I move fast. Ran all the way,<br> picked that stuff, ran back.<br> - Let me see what you've got.<br> - I'll just dump 'em with yours.<br> Nope.<br> Not a single berry.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Must have eaten them all.<br> No mail today, Charlie?<br> Holy MacKanolly,<br> I left it on the porch.<br> - How about bringin' it in? Can you do that?<br> - You bet.<br> - Glass of milk, Norman?<br> - No.<br> See ya broke<br> the screen door, Charlie.<br> It's just missing its little<br> "thingamabobbers" for the hinges.<br> - I could bring ya a couple from town tomorrow.<br> - Just be careful next time.<br> - Here it is, Norman. Drink it.<br> - Thank you, nurse.<br> Finish your coffee over here.<br> There you go.<br> There.<br> - What ya got there, Norman?<br> - I have no idea. I can't open it.<br> Here. Bite this, please.<br> - Oh, just his medicine.<br> - Oh, goody. What a swell surprise.<br> Nothing serious.<br> Just for his palpitations.<br> That's right, Charlie.<br> I have occasional heartthrobs.<br> Norman, we got<br> a letter from Chelsea.<br> Look at the<br> goddamn Orioles!<br> Baltimore's always<br> been a sneaky town.<br> Norman, she's coming<br> for your birthday.<br> Oh. How nice.<br> Yep. And she's bringing a friend.<br> She has the nicest boyfriend.<br> - Oh?<br> - They're coming together.<br> Then they're going on<br> to Europe for a while.<br> Oh, really? I don't want crowds of people<br> coming to my birthday.<br> I don't want crowds of people<br> watching me turn older.<br> Wait a minute.<br> It's not that Freddy person.<br> This is a different boyfriend<br> altogether.<br> What the hell's going on?<br> Detroit's disappeared!<br> Good God!<br> - What is it?<br> - Detroit's gone!<br> What happened to her husband?<br> What is it, Charlie?<br> I was wondering what happened<br> to Chelsea's husband.<br> It didn't work out.<br> Hey.<br> She says she's in love<br> with a dentist.<br> Does her boyfriend<br> know about this?<br> This is her new boyfriend.<br> Her new boyfriend is a dentist.<br> - That's who she's bringing here? A dentist?<br> - Yep.<br> Good God! He'll be staring<br> at our teeth all the time.<br> Shall we ask him<br> not to come?<br> No, we should have representatives<br> from all walks of life...<br> at my last birthday party.<br> Oh, Lord, this medicine should be<br> put away from all this hot air.<br> Why didn't<br> you marry Chelsea?<br> - You wouldn't let me.<br> - Oh?<br> If you had married somebody else,<br> I'd have allowed that.<br> - I didn't want anyone else.<br> - Oh.<br> - How old will you be?<br> - When?<br> - On your birthday.<br> - A hundred and three.<br> - Miss Appley was 97 in May. Isn't that amazing?<br> - Yeah.<br> - She died, you know.<br> - No.<br> Yep, last Tuesday.<br> We got a call,<br> in case any mail comes up.<br> Gave ya a forwarding address<br> for Miss Appley?<br> What's so funny?<br> - One of the lesbians expired.<br> - Oh! No.<br> - Which one, Charlie?<br> - Miss Appley.<br> Oh, well,<br> she had a good, full life.<br> Charlie said she was 97.<br> Ninety-seven?<br> Isn't that wonderful?<br> Puts us all to shame,<br> doesn't it?<br> There's something to be said<br> for a deviant lifestyle.<br> Well, thanks for the coffee, Ethel.<br> You still make<br> the best biscuits on the lake.<br> Thank you, Charlie. You must<br> come around when Chelsea comes.<br> - I haven't seen her in a long time.<br> - No.<br> - Well...<br> - Norman, Charlie's leaving.<br> - Good. Bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Watch out<br> for that screen door.<br> Norman! The loons are<br> teaching their baby to fly.<br> - Isn't that exciting?<br> - Listen to this.<br> "Retired people sought for handbill delivery.<br> Some walking involved."<br> I should call.<br> I can walk.<br> Is that why you came rushing back here?<br> To read those goddamned ads?<br> You want to know<br> why I came back so fast?<br> I got to the end<br> of our lane...<br> I couldn't remember<br> where the old town road was.<br> I wandered a way<br> in the woods.<br> There was nothing familiar.<br> Not one damn tree.<br> Scared me half to death.<br> That's why I came running<br> back here to you...<br> to see your pretty face.<br> I could feel safe.<br> I was still me.<br> You're safe,<br> you old poop.<br> And you're definitely still you...<br> pickin' on poor old Charlie.<br> After lunch...<br> After we've gobbled up<br> all those silly strawberries...<br> we'll take ourselves<br> to the old town road.<br> We've been there<br> a thousand times, darling.<br> A thousand.<br> And you'll remember it all.<br> Listen to me, mister.<br> You're my knight<br> in shining armor.<br> Don't you forget it.<br> You're gonna get<br> back on that horse...<br> and I'm gonna be right<br> behind you, holding on tight...<br> and away we're gonna<br> go, go, go!<br> I don't like horses.<br> - You are a pretty old dame, aren't you?<br> - Oh!<br> What are you doin' with<br> a dotty old son of a bitch like me?<br> Well, I haven't<br> the vaguest idea.<br> I don't think you should do that<br> in front of Chelsea's companion.<br> Oh, pooh. I was just<br> talking to my friends.<br> Hey, look at you.<br> My, oh, my, you have on a tie.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I put it there.<br> Do I look all right?<br> I haven't overdressed, have I?<br> You look sexy. I'm gonna have to do<br> some pretty fast maneuvers to catch up with you.<br> I have some other ties.<br> You could come as Miss Appley.<br> Oh. Thank you.<br> "Welcome home, Chelsea"?<br> I see my birthday party wasn't<br> cause enough for celebration.<br> I just wanted our little girl<br> to feel welcome, that's all.<br> Norman, wouldn't it be nice<br> if we could all get along this time?<br> Where the hell are they?<br> I'm getting older by the minute.<br> They said they'd be here<br> when they get here.<br> - Is that what they said?<br> - Yep.<br> That's a hell of an attitude. No wonder<br> we don't have any grandchildren.<br> - What would we do with grandchildren?<br> - Toss 'em on our knee.<br> We're the last of the Thayers,<br> you know.<br> End of the line<br> for a damn good name.<br> Yep, and we're gonna<br> take it out in style.<br> Oh, my God.<br> They're here,<br> and I'm not even dressed.<br> - I look like an old character.<br> - You are an old character.<br> Go on upstairs and change,<br> if it'll make you feel better<br> - Be nice to them!<br> - Sure.<br> I'll explain the risks involved in being<br> late to an old man's birthday party.<br> Anybody home?<br> Too late. Move that flower vase<br> over to the other side of the table.<br> - Why?<br> - Just do it! For once, just do it!<br> - Hey! Oh, Mommy!<br> - Oh, darling!<br> What a treat.<br> Let me look at you. You look great.<br> Where is he?<br> Just inside the door.<br> Go ahead. He's waiting for you.<br> Hello, Norman.<br> - Well, look at you.<br> - Happy birthday.<br> Look at this<br> little fat girl, Ethel.<br> Oh, Norman!<br> You're as thin as a rail, isn't she?<br> - Sure.<br> - Oh! My darling, I'm so glad you're home.<br> I didn't think<br> we were gonna make it.<br> - We rented a car that explodes every 40 miles.<br> - Rented a car, huh?<br> - In Boston.<br> - What sort of car is it?<br> - I don't know. Green, I think.<br> - A green car.<br> - I meant, what sort of make is it?<br> - I don't know.<br> She doesn't know.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Of course it doesn't matter.<br> I was just curious.<br> Well, I guess<br> I should have looked.<br> Let's see. It's very ugly,<br> and it breaks down a lot.<br> Ugly and breaks down?<br> Sounds like a Nash.<br> - Yes, well...<br> - Where's your friend?<br> You did bring your friend,<br> didn't you?<br> I knew there was something<br> I was forgetting.<br> - That's still on, huh?<br> - Well, as far as I know.<br> Come on in.<br> No one's gonna bite you.<br> - Mommy, Norman, this is Billy Ray.<br> - Oh?<br> How ya doin'?<br> You seem awfully young<br> to be a dentist.<br> - This is Billy Ray, Jr.<br> - I'm Norman Thayer, Jr. Where's...<br> His father is trying<br> to park the car.<br> This is a great surprise. You can call me Ethel,<br> and you can call Norman Norman.<br> I like your logic, Mommy.<br> I'm gonna go see if Bill has driven into the lake.<br> I'll put away<br> some of these things.<br> I hear you turned 80 today.<br> - That what you heard?<br> - Yeah.<br> Man, that's really old.<br> You should meet my father.<br> - Your father's still alive?<br> - No, but you should meet him.<br> Isn't this fun? Norman, why don't we<br> put Billy in Chelsea's old room?<br> Then he can look out<br> at the lake in the morning.<br> Why don't we put him out on the float?<br> He can look at the lake all night long.<br> - I'd like that.<br> - You'd be eaten alive by all the bugs.<br> - So?<br> - Norman, take him up.<br> - Show him where everything is.<br> - Come on, boy.<br> I just had a birthday too.<br> I turned 13 two weeks ago.<br> Oh? We're practically twins.<br> I'm so glad you're here.<br> He'll be right in. He actually thinks<br> you have to lock your car.<br> Mommy, Norman looks so old.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> You look great though.<br> - Thank you. So do you. I love your hair.<br> - Thanks.<br> How's his mind?<br> Is he remembering things better?<br> Oh, he's all right.<br> He's all right.<br> Come on, Billy. Let me show you<br> the bathroom, if I can remember where it is.<br> Well, at least<br> he hasn't changed.<br> Nope, he's still impossible.<br> It means so much to him to have you here.<br> - Now he's got someone he can pick on.<br> - Come on.<br> - Thank you for coming.<br> - Thank you for inviting me.<br> Chels.<br> Well, you finally made it.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> - This is my mother. This is Bill Ray.<br> - Hello.<br> - I think I saw a bear.<br> No, no. You couldn't have seen a bear<br> out there this time of year.<br> There are some rather<br> nasty moths though.<br> This was a little big<br> for a moth.<br> If you really want to be scared,<br> wait till you meet my father.<br> - Hey, Dad!<br> - Hey, Billy!<br> - Dad, they do have indoor plumbing.<br> - Great.<br> Chelsea was just<br> bullshitting us.<br> I like to paint a rather<br> rustic picture of life on Golden Pond.<br> - It's rustic, all right.<br> - It's lovely rusticity.<br> Yeah, we've been peeing<br> indoors for 40 years.<br> - You must be Norman.<br> - Yeah, must be. Who are you?<br> - Bill Ray.<br> - Bill Ray? The dentist?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Wanna see my teeth?<br> I'd just like to tell you, sir,<br> how glad we are to be here.<br> Chelsea's told me<br> so much about you...<br> your lovely wife and your<br> wonderful place on the lake.<br> We're very pleased<br> she's brought us here.<br> I'm frankly surprised<br> Chelsea could find the way.<br> Well, she's here, Norman,<br> and that's what's important.<br> Do you visit your parents?<br> - No, sir. My parents both passed away.<br> - I see.<br> Then you have a good excuse.<br> - Norman, please.<br> - Norman, why...<br> What? Am I not allowed<br> to speak to our guests? Is that it?<br> They're afraid<br> I'm going to embarrass them.<br> Well, I'm gonna go say hello to the lake.<br> Anybody coming?<br> Me. I never seen anyone<br> say hello to a lake before.<br> - Mommy, you coming?<br> - Yeah. Want to take the boat?<br> - Boat? All right!<br> - Bill, aren't you coming?<br> Where? Outside?<br> That's where the lake is.<br> Coming, Norman?<br> No, I think I'll just sit here<br> and enjoy the quiet.<br> - I'll stay too.<br> - With Bill.<br> - The screen door's broken.<br> - Really? Norman will fix it.<br> - I love your house.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's not for sale.<br> I don't want to buy it.<br> I just like it.<br> It has<br> a charming ambience.<br> How does it feel to turn 80?<br> Twice as bad as<br> it did turning 40.<br> Yeah. I know what that's like.<br> I turned 40 five years ago.<br> Forty-five now.<br> - Norman?<br> - Huh?<br> - Do you mind if I call you Norman?<br> - I believe you just did.<br> I don't want to press.<br> What should I call your wife?<br> How about Ethel?<br> That's her name.<br> Ethel Thayer. Sounds like<br> I'm lisping, doesn't it?<br> Ethel Thayer.<br> Almost kept her from marrying me.<br> Wanted me to change my last name to hers.<br> - What was that?<br> - I don't remember.<br> I think I'll<br> start a new book...<br> so I can finish it<br> before I'm finished myself.<br> Maybe a novelette.<br> Maybe something from<br> Reader's Digest Abridged.<br> Here's Treasure Island.<br> - Ever read this book?<br> - Oh, yeah, that's a great book.<br> I'd highly<br> recommend that one.<br> - No need for that. I've read it myself.<br> - Yeah?<br> But my mind is going,<br> so it'll all be new to me.<br> That son of yours<br> ever read this book?<br> I don't think so.<br> Your son hasn't<br> read Treasure Island?<br> No, but I intend<br> to have him read it.<br> His mother's been<br> the real force in his life lately...<br> but I intend to<br> eradicate, you know...<br> some of<br> the dishevelment.<br> Actually, things are coming together<br> very nicely for me lately.<br> I'm beginning to feel<br> very good about myself.<br> Meeting Chelsea<br> was a major...<br> thing and...<br> We have a very<br> kinetic relationship.<br> It's very positive.<br> I'm sure you'd be pleased.<br> - What do you charge for a filling?<br> - Hmm?<br> You're a dentist, aren't you?<br> What do you charge for a filling?<br> - It's generally $40.<br> - Forty dollars? Good God.<br> Norman?<br> We'd like to sleep together,<br> if it's all right with you.<br> What do you mean?<br> We'd like to sleep together<br> in the same room...<br> same bed... if it's<br> not offensive to you.<br> - All three of ya?<br> - No, just two.<br> You and Billy?<br> No.<br> Not Chelsea and Billy?<br> No.<br> That leaves<br> Chelsea and you then.<br> That's right.<br> Why would I find<br> that offensive?<br> You're not planning on doing<br> something unusual, are you?<br> No, no.<br> Just, you know...<br> Ah, doesn't seem too offensive<br> as long as you're quiet.<br> Thank you.<br> Chelsea always slept<br> in the same bed with her husband.<br> Yeah, I'm sure.<br> Ethel and I do. We sleep together.<br> Been doin' it for years.<br> - Sure, yeah.<br> - I guess I'd be...<br> delighted to have you<br> abuse my daughter under my own roof.<br> Would you like the room where<br> I first violated her mother?<br> Or would you be interested<br> in the master bedroom?<br> Ethel, your boy and I<br> could sleep out back.<br> You could do it right here<br> on the hearth. Like that?<br> - You're havin' a good time, aren't you?<br> - Huh?<br> Chelsea told me all about how you like<br> to have a good old time with people's heads.<br> She does too sometimes.<br> Sometimes I can get into it<br> and sometimes not.<br> I think you should know I'm pretty good<br> at recognizing crap when I hear it.<br> You know, it's not imperative<br> that you and I become friends.<br> But I thought<br> it would be nice.<br> I'm sure you're<br> a very fascinating person...<br> and I thought it would be<br> fascinating getting to know you.<br> That's obviously<br> not an easy task.<br> No.<br> You just go ahead and be...<br> as poopy as you want,<br> to quote Chelsea...<br> and I'll be as receptive<br> and as pleasant as I can be...<br> but I want you<br> to bear one thing in mind...<br> while you're jerking me around,<br> making me feel like an asshole...<br> I know precisely<br> what you're up to.<br> I'll take just<br> so much of it.<br> Okay?<br> Now, what is the bottom line<br> on this illicit sex question?<br> Very good.<br> That was a good speech. Bottom line, huh?<br> You're a bottom line man.<br> All right,<br> here's the bottom line.<br> Okay.<br> Hm?<br> You seem like a nice man.<br> Bit verbose, but nice.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And you're right about me.<br> - I am fascinating.<br> - I'm sure you are.<br> Let's get back to talking about sex.<br> Anything you want to know, just ask me.<br> No, I just...<br> I just wanted to clear up<br> that little question.<br> - Chelsea and I can sleep together, right?<br> - Sure, please do.<br> Just don't let<br> Ethel catch ya.<br> Dad! Dad!<br> I paddled the canoe!<br> A canoe. It's a boat,<br> just like the Indians had.<br> Actually, the Indians<br> use a different grade of aluminum.<br> Yeah. Chelsea wants you<br> to come down to the lake.<br> - She and Ethel are goin' skinny-dipping.<br> - Skinny-dipping?<br> Go ahead. Permissiveness runs rampant<br> here on Golden Pond.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, are there<br> any bears around here?<br> Oh, sure,<br> black bears and grizzlies.<br> One came along here last month<br> and ate an old lesbian.<br> Dad, come on.<br> He's just bullshitting you. Come on.<br> Okay.<br> - Hey, hey. Where do you think you're going?<br> - Skinny-dipping with Chelsea.<br> No, no, you're goin' back inside<br> and talk to Mr. Thayer.<br> Bullshit! I'm not goin' in there<br> with that old turkey. He gives me the creeps.<br> What if he dies?<br> If you don't start behaving yourself,<br> I'm gonna send you right back to your mother.<br> You understand that?<br> Is that what you want?<br> Now go back in there and talk to him.<br> Maybe you'll learn something.<br> Go on. Go on.<br> Remember when<br> I was nine years old...<br> and I came down and caught<br> you and Norman skinny-dipping?<br> - No, I don't remember.<br> - Oh, don't you remember?<br> I had that big light, and I shined it on Norman<br> on the diving board and he was naked.<br> He screamed at me. He called me a spy<br> and sent me to my room for the rest of the year.<br> Took me so long<br> to get over that.<br> It took Norman a long time<br> before he'd go skinny-dipping again.<br> He wouldn't even get out of the water<br> until I went up and made sure you were asleep.<br> I was so bloody mad at him<br> for yelling at you...<br> that I let him float around down here<br> for an hour or so, freezing to death.<br> Good!<br> You goin' skinny-dippin'?<br> Huh?<br> - Are you going skinny-dipping?<br> - Nah. You?<br> Nah.<br> I try to be selective about<br> who I flash in front of.<br> Oh?<br> Chelsea says you're<br> a real heavy-duty fisherman.<br> She calls you<br> the old man of the sea.<br> I've caught a few.<br> - You fish?<br> - Nah.<br> What do you do out there<br> in California?<br> I mean, what does<br> one do for recreation...<br> when one is 13<br> and not in school?<br> We cruise chicks.<br> - Hmm?<br> - Cruise chicks.<br> You know, meet 'em.<br> Girls.<br> Try to pick 'em up.<br> What do you do with 'em<br> when you have 'em?<br> Suck face.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> You know, kiss.<br> Suck face. You kiss.<br> Ever read this book<br> Treasure Island?<br> No.<br> - Go read it.<br> - Now?<br> Go on. Take it upstairs. Read the first chapter.<br> Give me a report in the morning.<br> I thought you said we were<br> gonna have a party here though.<br> I'll call you when the party's<br> underway, if it ever is. Go on.<br> Oh. I'm sorry.<br> That's all right.<br> Chelsea's still in the water.<br> You should go on down.<br> - No one should skinny-dip alone.<br> - Right.<br> - Oh...<br> - Yes?<br> What is that over there?<br> That's a lawn chair.<br> Oh.<br> - Go on. Right down the path.<br> - Right.<br> See ya later.<br> I thought you'd be nude.<br> Nope. Sorry.<br> I didn't want to overwhelm<br> our guest on his first night.<br> - He's nice, isn't he?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Forty dollars a filling.<br> - Forty dollars?<br> - That's enough to keep you off sweets.<br> - Hey.<br> He'd be a good catch,<br> wouldn't he?<br> - He said they wanted to sleep together.<br> - Why not? They're big people.<br> Yeah.<br> - You and I did, didn't we?<br> - Did we?<br> Oh, Norman.<br> Have you been<br> picking on him?<br> Yeah. He finds me<br> fascinating.<br> Well, why not?<br> Norman.<br> - Norman.<br> - Hmm?<br> Chelsea wants us<br> to do something for her.<br> She wants to leave Billy here<br> with us for a month.<br> - Which Billy?<br> - Oh!<br> Billy, Norman,<br> the little one.<br> Bill is supposed to have him for the summer,<br> and the kid would be miserable in Europe.<br> Bill seems very nice,<br> and Chels needs someone nice.<br> Couldn't we do that for her?<br> What would we do with the boy?<br> What would I say to him?<br> You'd think of something.<br> Let's do it.<br> Let's say we'll do it...<br> and give Chelsea<br> some happiness, yes?<br> All right.<br> We'll have a splendid time,<br> the three of us, won't we?<br> I don't know.<br> We might.<br> You know, Norman...<br> you really are<br> the sweetest man in the world...<br> but I'm the only one<br> who knows it.<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday, dear Norman<br> Happy birthday<br> To you<br> And many more<br> Beautiful.<br> I suppose you expect me<br> to sing something now.<br> Well, I'm not about to.<br> I've been trying all day<br> to draw some...<br> profound conclusions about<br> living fourscore years.<br> Haven't thought of anything.<br> Surprised it got here so fast.<br> But I'm glad I got to spend<br> so much time with this beautiful woman.<br> What's your name again?<br> I want to thank all of you<br> for coming all the way here from Disneyland...<br> to witness<br> this historic event.<br> Now that I'm<br> out of hot air...<br> I'm gonna need a little assistance<br> to get these candles out.<br> Come on, everybody.<br> Whoo!<br> - Come on!<br> - Chicken.<br> Charlie!<br> Well, holy MacKanolly.<br> Look at you!<br> - Chelsea MacKanelsie!<br> - Charlie MacKanolly!<br> Boy, it's good<br> to see you.<br> You've held up good.<br> Thanks.<br> So have you.<br> Bill! This is<br> my old friend, Charlie.<br> - He's the mailman.<br> - Hi. How are you?<br> Hello.<br> Want a ride?<br> I'd love one.<br> Great.<br> So you actually<br> deliver the mail in a boat, huh?<br> What an incredible<br> tradition.<br> Oh, Charlie is a legend on this lake.<br> He gets the mail through<br> no matter what.<br> - Isn't that right, Charlie?<br> - Yeah. Guess so.<br> Must be a bitch<br> in the winter, huh?<br> Yeah. In the winter<br> I have a hell of a time.<br> Course, there's nobody<br> on the lake to deliver to...<br> so I get done<br> a lot faster.<br> Well, you got a great setup here.<br> You're a lucky man.<br> You're a lucky man too.<br> Yeah, I guess I am.<br> What do you usually do<br> at a time like this?<br> Well, generally,<br> I just fall into the lake.<br> Just...<br> Whoa! Oh!<br> - Here, let me get...<br> - No!<br> All right, come on, Dad.<br> Big rolls here. You can beat him.<br> - All right.<br> - Big rolls.<br> - All right!<br> - Two threes. What does that mean?<br> It means doubles,<br> which always means you get 14, ya see?<br> You just send me home<br> and get 20 more, for God's sake.<br> All right, Dadders!<br> - Good.<br> - Excellent. You're a natural.<br> Startin' to regret<br> teaching you this game.<br> Chels. Hey, Chels.<br> Parcheesi pro.<br> Chelsea doesn't like<br> playing games.<br> We don't know why.<br> Probably doesn't like losing.<br> I tend to panic when<br> the competition gets too intense.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - Nothing.<br> We play serious Parcheesi<br> around here.<br> I let Norman win every week or so<br> just to keep his spirits up.<br> Ah, ha, ha, ha.<br> What I'd like to know is<br> why you enjoy playing games.<br> - Huh?<br> - You seem to like beating people.<br> I wonder why.<br> You get another chance, Bill.<br> Another roll of the dice.<br> Well, here's<br> my little early bird.<br> Mmm.<br> Are you having fun?<br> That's why you come to camp,<br> you know... to have fun.<br> What's the matter, darling?<br> Nothing.<br> I don't think I've ever grown up<br> on Golden Pond.<br> Do you understand?<br> No. No, I don't think<br> I understand.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I act like a big person<br> everywhere else.<br> I'm in charge<br> of Los Angeles.<br> And I come here,<br> I feel like a little fat girl.<br> That's just because<br> your father said that.<br> My father is<br> a goddamn bastard.<br> Oh, come on, Chels.<br> Watch your language.<br> Why? You gonna<br> wash my mouth out with soap?<br> That was a rather<br> bizarre custom.<br> Mother, do you know,<br> I've been answering to Norman all my life.<br> Makes me so mad!<br> Even when I'm 3,000 miles away...<br> and I don't even see him,<br> I'm still answering to him.<br> Norman is<br> a goddamn poop.<br> Oh, for the Lord's sake,<br> here we go again.<br> You had a miserable<br> childhood.<br> Your father was overbearing,<br> your mother ignored you.<br> What else is new?<br> Chelsea...<br> you have a great big chip<br> on your shoulder...<br> which is very unattractive.<br> It is. It is.<br> You stay away for years at a time.<br> You never come home<br> unless I beg you to...<br> and then when you do, all you can do<br> is be disagreeable about the past.<br> What's the point?<br> Don't you think that everyone<br> looks back on their childhood...<br> with a certain amount of bitterness<br> and regret about something?<br> It doesn't have to<br> ruin your life, darling.<br> You're a big girl now.<br> Aren't you tired of it all?<br> Bore, bore.<br> Life marches by, Chels.<br> I suggest<br> you get on with it.<br> Have a wonderful trip,<br> darling.<br> And don't worry.<br> Billy will take good care of us.<br> - Okay.<br> - Don't go getting involved with any foreigners.<br> Right.<br> Let me have<br> your bag, Chels.<br> Good-bye, kid.<br> Okay.<br> - You're gonna be okay now?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> - You behave yourself.<br> - Yeah. You guys behave yourself too.<br> We will. Okay.<br> Norman, good-bye.<br> - You work on that Parcheesi game.<br> - Ha, ha, ha.<br> Good luck, everybody.<br> - Thank you so much. We had a great time.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I was so happy you came.<br> - Okay. Bye-bye.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> Just want you guys to know that<br> I'm not about to take any crap from you.<br> Well, gentlemen...<br> it's a beautiful day.<br> - We're going fishing.<br> - What?<br> - We're going what?<br> - Fishing.<br> You remember fishing,<br> Norman.<br> You're going to show Billy what<br> life is all about on Golden Pond.<br> Come on, Billy.<br> Bullshit.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Does that mean you<br> can't wait to get out there...<br> or that it's not<br> your cup of tea?<br> It's bullshit, that's all.<br> I see.<br> Well, come on, Norman.<br> Let's get ready.<br> You like that word,<br> don't you? Bullshit.<br> Yeah.<br> It's a good word.<br> Okay, Grandpa,<br> do your stuff.<br> Hey, hey!<br> Pretty slick, huh?<br> Look at this.<br> This was Chelsea's when<br> she was about your age.<br> Caught some pretty<br> respectable fish wearin' this.<br> Surprised you still<br> kept it, if it's Chelsea's.<br> I might not<br> stick around here.<br> I might just haul my ass...<br> out to Wyoming or Puerto Rico...<br> one of those places.<br> Listen. I mean, I know I'm<br> just being dumped here.<br> Which is like my middle name.<br> You turkeys don't want me.<br> Bullshit.<br> I'm 67 years older than you.<br> How do you know<br> what I want?<br> We're going fishing now.<br> We want you to go along.<br> If you want to come with us...<br> I suggest you get your ass<br> down to the dock in two minutes.<br> Okay, Mrs. Turkey,<br> let's go.<br> Here he is.<br> I thought I might...<br> just sort of come along<br> and see what this bullshit is all about.<br> Get in.<br> You look very handsome<br> in that fishing vest.<br> Oh, thank you!<br> I mean, thank you.<br> So, how fast does this<br> old tub go, anyway?<br> All right!<br> Go up this time,<br> not just back. Up and back.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Nothing to be afraid of.<br> Back flip's one<br> of the easiest dives.<br> Oh, yeah? Then why don't you<br> come and try it?<br> Norman, you stay<br> right where you are.<br> Dive, boy.<br> All right.<br> One, two, three!<br> - Ouch! Good God!<br> - That wasn't it.<br> - Thanks for telling me.<br> - Norman, we've got him for a whole month.<br> Don't kill him<br> the first week.<br> This is it?<br> This is it.<br> Give me your hook.<br> You got to be patient when<br> you're fishing for trout, boy.<br> There's a trout<br> living in this cove...<br> that weighs 10 pounds<br> if he weighs an ounce.<br> First saw him<br> three or four years ago.<br> Hooked him<br> two years ago...<br> and again last year.<br> But he's a crafty old<br> son of a bitch!<br> It's your<br> last chance, Walter!<br> Called him Walter 'cause<br> he reminds me of Ethel's brother.<br> 'Cause he's fat<br> and lazy and ugly!<br> Okay, throw her out.<br> Let her out.<br> Plenty of line.<br> How's your line?<br> On the bottom?<br> If your line's floating,<br> it's on the bottom!<br> That isn't doing you any good. Bring it up!<br> Bring it up, for Christ's sake!<br> All right.<br> Hey, man, you don't have to yell at me.<br> Who do you think you are,<br> anyway, Long John Silver?<br> God.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's okay.<br> Havin' fun?<br> - Yeah.<br> - That's good.<br> Better than cruising chicks,<br> isn't it?<br> - No.<br> - I suppose not.<br> For God's sake!<br> What the hell are you doin' here?<br> Brought your lunch.<br> How the hell<br> did you find us?<br> Shh! You'll scare<br> the fish.<br> Ethel, this is supposed<br> to be a secret fishing place.<br> Lucky guess.<br> We don't need any lunch.<br> We got more important things going on.<br> Don't be such an old poop.<br> Billy might get hungry.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Maybe we ought to see<br> what she brought us.<br> Hold on,<br> you son of a bitch!<br> - What? What?<br> - Run with it!<br> Hey, it's not Walter,<br> but he's related.<br> Oh, you ugly old<br> son of a bitch!<br> - San frantastic!<br> - I love you! I love you!<br> Get the net, boy. We're gonna<br> have trout for dinner tonight.<br> Not the little one.<br> The big one. It's in back of me.<br> That ain't no stupid sunfish.<br> Oh, ho! Little baby.<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute. Oh, lovely!<br> Get the net<br> down underneath him.<br> - Slowly bring him up.<br> - Oh, wow.<br> Look at that beauty.<br> Yes, sirree.<br> Oh, ho!<br> This is a trout.<br> A rainbow trout.<br> Good going, boy!<br> Norman, we've caught<br> eight million fish.<br> - Are you sure none of these is Walter?<br> - Yep.

I won him<br> in a contest. He was the booby prize.<br> Has he got you cleaning<br> those stupid fish?<br> That's right. He cleans the stupid ones,<br> and I clean the smart ones.<br> Fortunately, the smart ones<br> are too smart to get caught.<br> That's why<br> they're in schools.<br> Come on in, Norman.<br> Get me a fire going.<br> It's going to be a bit nippy tonight.<br> You hear that, boy?<br> Get a fire going.<br> Norman, for Pete's sake.<br> Billy doesn't have<br> to do all your chores.<br> What's the point of having<br> a dwarf if he doesn't do chores?<br> - Damn!<br> - You got the match backwards.<br> Want me to do it?<br> I think I know how to light a fire<br> for Christ's sake!<br> What are you reading?<br> A Tale of Two Cities.<br> Oh, trs bien,<br> trs bien.!<br> Norman!

Hurry up.<br> I'm coming.<br> Norman isn't ever late.<br> - I don't understand it.<br> - Oh, he'll be all right.<br> Ethel, we've been<br> back and forth here three times.<br> They must have<br> pulled up somewhere.<br> You don't suppose he would have<br> gone in there, do you, Charlie?<br> He's not that crazy.<br> Yes, he is. Let's go.<br> I'm not gonna drive my boat<br> into Purgatory Cove.<br> Yes, you are, Charlie.<br> I'll point the way.<br> Holy MacKanolly.<br> It's full of rocks,<br> Charlie.

Well, I am.<br> I'm just doing this<br> for Billy.<br> Give the poor boy another chance<br> to catch a fish.<br> We've been doing goddamn<br> jigsaw puzzles for a week.<br> You will stay<br> in our cove, won't you?<br> There aren't any trout<br> left in our cove.<br> Norman, we have enough<br> trout left in the fridge...<br> to last us six years.<br> Yeah, but we haven't<br> caught Walter yet.<br> Never mind.<br> We'll stay in the damn cove.<br> With a tent on the banks<br> of the Golden Pond<br> We are the girls<br> from Camp Hoochicoya<br> You can tell who we are<br> By the gleam in our eyes<br> Oh, our minds are clear<br> And our hearts are strong<br> We are dancing here<br> But we won't be long<br> There will soon be deer<br> Where there now are fawns<br> But we'll remember our years<br> - On Golden Pond<br> - On Golden Pond<br> How!<br> Hey!<br> - Mommy.<br> - Oh!<br> How did you get here?<br> I rented a car...<br> a Volare, made by Plymouth.<br> - Oh, ho.<br> - Look at you.<br> My God. You've had this jacket<br> as long as I can remember.<br> - It looks it, doesn't it?<br> - It looks great.<br> How was your trip?<br> Oh, not bad.<br> How's the kid?<br> - You still got him, or did you drown him?<br> - We've still got him.<br> He's out there fishing<br> with his best buddy.<br> - You can see him.<br> - Where's the Thayer IV?<br> Charlie's fixing her.<br> Norman and Billy<br> tried to drive her...<br> through a rock<br> in Purgatory Cove.<br> - Did they get hurt?<br> - No.<br> Norman got a bump on the head<br> which he's playing to the hilt...<br> but he's all right.<br> They're both fine,<br> thank God.<br> Do you still have Bill,<br> or did you drown him?<br> Oh, I still have him.<br> He had to get back to the coast.<br> - He had a mouth that needed looking into.<br> - Ah.<br> So, Norman and Billy<br> have gotten along all right?<br> Oh, Billy is the happiest thing<br> that's happened to Norman since Roosevelt.<br> I should have rented him<br> a 13-year-old boy years ago.<br> You could have<br> traded me in.<br> Except I think he probably<br> makes a better son than I did.<br> You made<br> a very nice daughter.<br> How come it's so easy?<br> What do you mean, darling?<br> Why wasn't that old son of a bitch<br> ever my friend?<br> You're sounding very childish.<br> Of course he was your friend.<br> He's your father.<br> Chels, you're<br> such a nice person.<br> Can't you think<br> of something nice to say?<br> I married Bill<br> in Brussels.<br> You did what in Brussels?<br> I married Bill.<br> Does it count<br> in this country?<br> - Afraid so.<br> - Oh, bless you, darling.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Nothin' to it.<br> Norman will be<br> so pleased.<br> Yeah, sure. What do you<br> suppose he's gonna say?<br> "Hey, Chels, fantastic!<br> I'm so happy that you finally<br> got your life together.<br> And I'm so proud."<br> - And he will be proud.<br> - No, he won't. No, he won't.<br> And you know why?<br> Because he doesn't care.<br> He is a selfish<br> son of a bitch.<br> That old son of a bitch<br> happens to be my husband.<br> Oh, shit!<br> Oh, shit!<br> Norman!<br> - Shit!<br> - Don't get so excited.<br> It's only a sunfish.<br> Only a sunfish?<br> You doubting the word<br> of a genius?<br> No respectable trout<br> in this cove.<br> Chased 'em out years ago.<br> Well, it's doing<br> a pretty good trout imitation.<br> Get the net!<br> Good God!<br> It's Walter!<br> What the hell<br> you doin' here, you son of a bitch?<br> Oh! Keep that line<br> tight, boy!<br> Oh, you beauty.<br> Keep your line tight.<br> Keep reeling in.<br> Little closer. Little closer.<br> Oh, look at that!<br> - We caught Walter!<br> - We caught Walter, the son of a bitch!<br> Chels? I brought<br> your sweater and your shoes.<br> - And your car's out front.<br> - I'm such an ass. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry too. But, darling,<br> you're wrong about your dad.<br> He does care.<br> He cares deeply.<br> It's just that he's an absolute mutt<br> about telling anyone.<br> I know he'd walk<br> through fire for me...<br> and he'd walk<br> through fire for you too.<br> And if you don't<br> understand that...<br> you're not<br> looking closely enough.<br> I don't even know him.<br> Chels, Norman<br> is 80 years old.<br> He has<br> heart palpitations...<br> and trouble<br> remembering things.<br> Just exactly when do you expect<br> this friendship to begin?<br> I'm afraid of him.<br> Well, he's afraid of you,<br> so you should get along fine.<br> Here he comes, Chels.<br> Talk to him.<br> Hey, hey!<br> Hey!<br> Look at you!<br> Hi, kid.<br> - Where's the dentist?<br> - He had to get back.<br> - He'll call you tonight.<br> - Okay.<br> - Hello, Norman.<br> - Well, well.<br> Oh, Chelsea!<br> We caught Walter.<br> Do you know<br> who Walter is?<br> - Well, I have a feeling he's a fish.<br> - Yes.<br> A humongous fish! And we<br> caught him today, didn't we, Norman?<br> - Well, let me see him.<br> - We let him go.<br> - Yeah. We let him go.<br> - I think I've heard this story before.<br> No! No, it's true.<br> Norman and I thought<br> that if Walter's lived this long...<br> we should let him<br> keep on living.<br> I'm gonna go tell Ethel.<br> Hey, Norman!<br> We caught the son of a bitch!<br> We caught him!<br> Good job! Whoo!<br> You got yourself<br> a friend, huh?<br> Yeah, he's all right.<br> Hasn't been too difficult.<br> - How's your forehead?<br> - Huh?<br> Oh, this.<br> It's all right.<br> Lot of pain.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> Norman, I want to talk to you.<br> What seems<br> to be the problem?<br> There's no problem.<br> I just...<br> I want to talk to you.<br> I think that...<br> maybe you and I should have the kind<br> of relationship that we're supposed to have.<br> What kind of relationship is that?<br> Well, you know...<br> like a father<br> and a daughter.<br> Oh, just in the nick<br> of time, huh?<br> Worried about<br> the will, are you?<br> I'm leaving everything to you<br> except what I'm taking with me.<br> Just stop it.<br> I don't want anything.<br> It seems that you and me<br> have been mad at each other for so long.<br> I didn't know we were mad.<br> I thought we just didn't like each other.<br> - I want to be your friend.<br> - Oh.<br> This mean you'll<br> come around more often?<br> Mean a lot<br> to your mother.<br> I'll come around<br> more often.<br> Well.<br> Yep.<br> - Oh! I got married in Brussels.<br> - You did?<br> In Brussels?<br> - He makes me very happy.<br> - Well, good.<br> Does he speak English?<br> - Bill... I married Bill.<br> - Bill? Oh, Bill!<br> I'm glad, Chelsea.<br> That's "san frantastic."<br> - What?<br> - Is Billy gonna be living with ya?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Well, good.<br> Isn't that something?<br> Good for you.<br> You know something?<br> I got him doing<br> the back flip just like a pro.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> That's great.<br> - Want me to get him down and show you?<br> - No. Not right now.<br> Okay. Oh, that's right.<br> You never were a great back flipper, were you?<br> I was always<br> too fat, remember?<br> Yeah, I do<br> remember that now.<br> Well, probably<br> a lot easier for a boy.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> - Do you want to see me do a back flip?<br> - Huh?<br> I am gonna do<br> a goddamn back flip.<br> Chelsea,<br> you don't have to.<br> I want to!<br> Make sure you go up,<br> not just back.<br> Up and back.<br> Oh, I'm scared.<br> Nothing to be scared of.<br> The back flip is one of the easiest dives of all.<br> - I'm scared anyway.<br> - Don't do it.<br> It doesn't matter<br> if you don't do the stupid dive.<br> It's not important.<br> I did it!<br> She did it!<br> Chelsea did a back flip!<br> I went over!<br> It was lousy, but I did it!<br> - Good for you!<br> - Yea!<br> You could come out...<br> - instead of going to Florida.<br> - We'll discuss it.<br> If I can persuade Norman that Los Angeles<br> is part of the United States...<br> it shouldn't be too much...<br> Norman! What in the world<br> are you doing now?<br> Hey there, cool breeze.<br> In case you want<br> to take a break from cruising.<br> - Wow! Thank you, Captain.<br> - He can't take that fool thing on the plane.<br> - Yes, he can.<br> - Got something for you too.<br> You know<br> what this is?<br> University of Pennsylvania diving finals, 1921.<br> Second place.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> Now I can retire.<br> Show that to your new husband.<br> Maybe he'll give us a discount on dental work.<br> Well, I guess<br> I'll be seeing you, ya nitwit.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'll miss you, Norman.<br> Bye-bye, darling.<br> - Good-bye, woman.<br> - Bye-bye, Billy.<br> Well...<br> good-bye, Norman.<br> Dad.<br> Come on, Norman. Let's get these<br> last boxes out to the car and be gone.<br> For God's sake.<br> - Not too heavy, is it?<br> - Of course it's not too heavy.<br> God, this is heavy!<br> - You're trying to kill me.<br> - I've thought about it.<br> Put it down<br> if it's too much.<br> - What the hell do you have in here?<br> - My mother's china.<br> - Put the box down, darling.<br> - Your mother never liked me.<br> Of course she did.<br> Norman, what is it?<br> What's the matter, darling?<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Norman! Norman! My darling!<br> My darling!<br> I'll get your medicine.<br> Here, Norman.<br> - Take this, darling. Put it under your tongue.<br> - What is it?<br> Nitroglycerin.<br> Put it under your tongue.<br> Dear God,<br> don't take him now.<br> You don't want him.<br> He's just an old poop.<br> Norman. Norman!<br> - Maybe we should call a doctor.<br> - Oh, yes!<br> Yes. I'll get<br> the telephone.<br> I'll get the telephone.<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Dear God.<br> Dear God.<br> How are you feeling, Norman?<br> Pretty good.<br> How are you?<br> - How's the angina?<br> - The what?<br> - The pain, damn it!<br> - Pretty good, as pain goes.<br> This stupid operator!<br> Hello? Hello?<br> What's the matter<br> with her?<br> She's slow.<br> - How are you feeling now?<br> - Oh, I don't know.<br> You planning to die?<br> Is that what you're up to?<br> While I'm waiting for this moron<br> to answer the telephone...<br> let me say something<br> to you, Norman Thayer, Jr.<br> - I'd rather you didn't.<br> - Really?<br> Yes. Oh, this stupid,<br> stupid operator.<br> I'm gonna have to call<br> the hospital directly.<br> The phone book.<br> I'll get the phone book.<br> - What is it?<br> - Will you come here?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Yes, Norman?<br> My darling?<br> Ethel...<br> Yes. I'm here, Norman.<br> - Ethel?<br> - Yes? Yes?<br> - Ethel...<br> - What is it, Norman?<br> I think I'm feeling<br> all right now.<br> - Are you serious?<br> - Yeah. My heart's stopped hurting.<br> - Maybe I'm dead.<br> - Oh, I love you so much!<br> I'm sorry about<br> your mother's china.<br> Why did you strain yourself?<br> You know better.<br> I was showing off.<br> Trying to turn you on.<br> Well, you succeeded. No need<br> for you to try that sort of thing again.<br> - Good.<br> - You know something?<br> This is the first time that I've really felt<br> that we were gonna die.<br> I've known it all along.<br> When I looked at you<br> here on the floor...<br> I could actually<br> see you dead.<br> I could see you in your blue suit and white,<br> starched shirt...<br> in Thomas's funeral parlor<br> on Bradshaw Street.<br> - How'd I look?<br> - Not good, Norman.<br> You've been talking about death<br> ever since we met...<br> but this is the first time<br> I really felt it.<br> Yeah? How's it feel?<br> Oh...<br> it feels odd.<br> Cold, I guess.<br> Not that bad, really.<br> Not so frightening.<br> Almost comforting.<br> Not such a bad place to go.<br> I don't know!<br> Oh, Norman.<br> Oh, God.<br> Well, don't you want<br> to say good-bye to the lake?<br> Do you think<br> you're strong enough?<br> Yeah, I think so.<br> If I fall over face-first<br> in the water...<br> you'll know I wasn't.<br> Now take it easy,<br> for God's sake.<br> I'm only good for<br> one near miss a day.<br> - Hello there.<br> - Hi.<br> Want to dance?<br> Or would you rather<br> just suck face?<br> Oh, Norman,<br> you really are a case, you know.<br> Ethel, listen.<br> The loons...<br> they've come around<br> to say good-bye.<br> Just the two of them now.<br> Their baby's all grown up...<br> and moved to Los Angeles<br> or somewhere.<br>
