                        Now you take it easy, slugger.<br> Joey!<br> Joe Doyle!<br> All right! What do you want?<br> I got one of your birds.<br> I recognised him by the band.<br> It must be Danny-boy.|I lost him in the last race.<br> He flew into my coop.<br> -You want him?|-I got to watch myself these days.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Don't worry.<br> -I'll take him up to your loft.|-Okay, I'll see you on the roof.<br> How goes?<br> He's up on the roof.<br> The pigeon?<br> Yeah, it worked.<br> I think somebody fell off the roof.<br> He thought he'd sing|to the Crime Commission. He won't.<br> I thought they'd talk to him.<br> That's the idea.<br> I thought they'd talk to him|and get him to dummy up.<br> Maybe he gave them an argument.<br> I figured the worst they was gonna do|was lean on him a little bit.<br> Maybe he gave them an argument.<br> He's been giving Johnny the Boss|a lot of arguments lately.<br> He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.<br> A canary.<br> Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.<br> Come on, I'll buy you a drink.<br> I'll be in there later and....<br> Father Barry is here.<br> Same thing happened to my Andy|five years ago.<br> -You're the boy's father?|-That's right.<br> Looks like he fell off the roof,|or maybe he was pushed.<br> -Any ideas?|-No.<br> He was the only longshoreman that had|the guts to talk to the crime investigators.<br> -Who asked you?|-Everybody knows that.<br> Shut up.<br> -lf he took my advice he wouldn't be--|-Everyone knows that.<br> I said, "Shut up!"<br> I know how you feel about cops,|but if you give me...<br> ...some leads I could--<br> I kept telling him, "Don't say nothing.<br> "Keep quiet, you'll live longer."<br> I've been on the docks all my life,|boy, and there's one thing I learned.<br> You don't ask no questions,|you don't answer no questions...<br> ...unless you want to wind up like that.<br> Edie, come here.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Father, who'd want to kill Joey?<br> Stay away from him! Stay away from him!<br> Edie, listen!<br> Remember time and faith are great healers.<br> Father, my brother is dead|and you talk about time and faith.<br> My brother was the best kid in the|neighbourhood and everybody said so.<br> I'm in the church if you need me.<br> You're in the church if I need you?<br> Did you ever hear of a saint|hiding in a church?<br> I want to know who killed my brother!<br> What's the matter with you, punk?<br> Boss, Packy wants another drink|on the cuff.<br> Give it to him.<br> And here's the cut on the shape-up.<br> Charley, you count them.<br> The banana boat is 46 tomorrow.<br> If we pull a walkout,|it might be a few bucks from the shippers.<br> -Them bananas go bad in a hurry.|-Ask $2,000.<br> Clowns can't fight.<br> There's nobody tough anymore.<br> Hi, slugger.<br> Hi, kid.<br> Where's Morgan?|Where's that big banker of mine?<br> Right here, Mr. Friendly.<br> -Hi, JP, how's business?|-Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.<br> He won't take no loans|and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.<br> -He's my wife's nephew.|-He won't take no loans!<br> I got to put him to work.|She'd murder me!<br> That's why I never got married.<br> Here's the interest on the day, boss. $532.<br> You count it.<br> Counting makes me sleepy.<br> You handle that sheet metal all right?<br> It was easy. The new checker faked|the receipt. Here.<br> You want to talk to me,|take the cigar out of your mouth.<br> -Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.|-Sure.<br> -Here you are, 45 bills.|-Terry, you count this.<br> Come on, go on, it's good for you.<br> -lt develops your mind.|-What mind?<br> Shut up. I like the kid.<br> Remember the night|he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley?<br> We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.<br> I lost the count.<br> Okay, forget it, Einstein.<br> How come you never got an education|like your brother Charley?<br> The only arithmetic he ever got|was hearing the referee count up to 10.<br> You're not too funny today, Fat Man.<br> Hey, what gives|with our boy tonight, Charley?<br> He isn't himself.<br> It's the Joey Doyle thing|and how he exaggerates the thing.<br> Too much Marquis of Queensbury|softens him up.<br> Listen, I'm a soft touch, too.|Ask any rummy on the dock...<br> ...if I'm not good for a fin any time|they put the arm on me.<br> But my old lady raised us 10 kids|on a stinking watchman's pension.<br> When I was 16,|I had to beg for work in the hold.<br> I didn't work my way up|out of there for nothing.<br> I know that, Johnny, I know it.<br> Taking over this local took a little doing.<br> There were rough fellas in the way.|They gave me this to remember them by.<br> He kept his hand over his throat|to stay alive and he still went after them.<br> I know what's eating you.<br> I got 2,000 dues-paying members in|this local, that's $72,000 a year legitimate.<br> When each one of them puts in|a couple of bucks a day just to make sure...<br> ...the work's steady, well, figure it out.<br> That's just for openers.<br> We've got the fattest piers|in the fattest harbour in the world.<br> Everything moves in and out,|we take our cut.<br> Why shouldn't we?|If we can get it, we're entitled to it.<br> You don't suppose I can afford to be|boxed out of a deal like this, do you?<br> A deal I sweated and bled for, on account|of one lousy little cheese-eater...<br> ...that Doyle bum, who thinks he can|squeal to the crime commission. Do you?<br> Do you?<br> No, Johnny.|I just figured I should have been told.<br> I make it $2,623.<br> You're $50 short, Skins.<br> Gimme.<br> -I must've miscounted.|-Gimme!<br> You come from Green Point, go back there.|You don't work here no more.<br> Here, kid, here's half a bill.|Go get you a load on.<br> No, I'm okay, Johnny, thanks.<br> Present from your Uncle Johnny.<br> And Mac, tomorrow morning when you|shape the men, put Terry up in the loft.<br> Number one. Every day.<br> It's nice, easy work if you check in|and goof off on a coffee bag.<br> Okay?<br> You got a real friend here.<br> Now don't forget it.<br> Why should he forget it?<br> Thanks, Johnny.<br> All right, payday.<br> Rony.<br> Mac.<br> Hi, Terry.<br> -Hi, kid.|-I was just going to feed them.<br> I already fed them.<br> You must've been up early?<br> I was up anyhow,|so I figured I might as well.<br> They sure got it made.<br> Eating, sleeping, flying around like crazy,|raising gobs of squabs.<br> Well, I better get over there.<br> Be careful. Don't spill no water on the|floor. I don't want them to catch cold.<br> I'll see you around.<br> Come on, Tony, give me the tabs.<br> He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.<br> Sure he was,|that's why he got it in the head.<br> But he couldn't learn|to keep his mouth shut.<br> Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?<br> The boys at work today|will be chipping in gladly.<br> No thanks, fellas, I'm gonna shape.<br> -Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?|-Johnny Friendly, the "great labour leader."<br> Why don't you keep that big mouth|of yours shut?<br> What are you, a wise guy?<br> If I was wise, I wouldn't be|no longshoreman for 30 years.<br> I'm poorer now than when I started.<br> -Wise guy.|-Big mouth.<br> Don't mess with those guys.<br> I brought you Joey's windbreaker.|It might come in handy.<br> -Go ahead, wear it.|-Thanks, Pop.<br> Mine's more full of holes|than the Pittsburgh infield.<br> Hey, Joe, I got a coat for you.<br> Do you know Terry Malloy?<br> No, I don't. Never heard of him.<br> You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?<br> So what?<br> Didn't I see you fight|a couple of years ago?<br> Without the birdseed, what do you want?<br> Identification.<br> Waterfront Crime Commission.|What's that?<br> I just want to ask you a few questions.<br> We'll hold public hearings|on waterfront crime...<br> ...and underworld infiltration|of longshore unions.<br> -I don't know nothing.|-You haven't heard the questions yet.<br> -What did you say?|-You heard me.<br> There's a rumour that you're one of|the last people to see Joey Doyle alive.<br> I don't know nothing.<br> Nobody's accusing you of anything,|Mr. Malloy.<br> I hope you understand that.<br> Just want to ask you some questions|about some people you may know.<br> -People I may know.|-That's right.<br> -You better get out of here, buster!|-Slow down, boy.<br> I don't know nothing, I ain't seen nothing,|and I'm not saying nothing.<br> Why don't you and your girlfriend take off.<br> All right, Mr. Malloy!<br> You've every right not to talk|if that's what you choose to do.<br> -The public has a right to know the facts.|-Yeah.<br> We'll be seeing you again.<br> Never's going to be too much soon|for me, Shorty.<br> Take it easy.<br> How do you like them mutts|taking me for a pigeon.<br> -Who is it?|-I don't know who they are.<br> You're three weeks behind on the last $25,|but I'm willing to take a chance.<br> Some chance at ten percent a week|and if we don't borrow, we don't work.<br> May you rot in hell, JP.<br> When I'm dead and gone,|you'll know what a friend I was.<br> Why don't you drop dead now,|so we can test your theory?<br> Condolences.<br> Hey, Pop, look.<br> Let her go, Tony.<br> I guess I spoke out of turn last night.<br> You think I'm just a gravy-train rider|with a turned-around collar, don't you?<br> I see the sisters taught you not to lie.<br> All right. Loft gang: Malloy...<br> ...Hendriks, Padowski...<br> ...Westerfield, McGuier.<br> I've been thinking about your question,|and you're right, Edie.<br> This is my parish.<br> I don't know how much I can do,|but I'll never find out...<br> ...unless I come down here|and take a good look for myself.<br> I need some extra banana carriers.<br> Bananas again.<br> I wonder when we'll get a boat from|Ireland with good Irish whiskey on it.<br> Dugan, my boy, you're dreaming again.<br> All right. Kelly. Richie.<br> Yeah, you.<br> What's the matter?|Nobody want to work today?<br> Yeah, you.<br> Who do you see to get|a day's pay around here?<br> -Meatballs.|-Definitely.<br> Come here.<br> Hey, Terry, grab that one!<br> Give me that.<br> Get away!<br> -Give it to me!|-Why?<br> Give it to me!<br> What makes you so special?<br> Things are looking up on the dock.<br> Don't you recognise her?|That's Joey Doyle's sister.<br> Give me that.<br> -You're Joey Doyle's sister?|-Yes, I am.<br> You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.<br> It's been nice wrestling with you.<br> Edie!<br> Pop. Here's your tab, take it.<br> All right, give it to me. I can use it.<br> Now get back to the sisters|where you belong.<br> I'm surprised at you, Father,|if you don't mind my saying so.<br> Letting her see things ain't fit|for the eyes of a decent girl.<br> All right, that's all. Come back tomorrow.<br> What do you do now?<br> Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.<br> I've been standing here for five|straight mornings and that bum there...<br> -Come on, get out of here!|-...looks right through you.<br> -I'm sorry, Father, I didn't mean it.|-What do you want to do?<br> Come on, let's go get a ball.<br> Wait a minute.|Is this all you do, just take it like this?<br> What about your unions?<br> No other union in the country'd|stand for a thing like that.<br> The waterfront is tougher, Father,|like it ain't part of America.<br> -Do you know how a trigger local works?|-No. How?<br> You get up in the meeting, you make a|motion, the lights go out, then you go out.<br> That's how it's been since Johnny|and his cowboys took over the local.<br> Name one place where it's safe|to talk without getting clobbered.<br> -The church.|-What?<br> The bottom of the church.<br> You know|what you're letting yourself in for?<br> You got a cigarette on you?<br> Right over there.<br> -You working hard?|-Yeah.<br> You wouldn't mind working once in a while|to justify this lofty position, would you?<br> I finished the work.|I counted all them bags.<br> We have an extra detail for you.<br> That's if you don't mind|being disturbed or anything.<br> The priest and this Doyle girl are getting|a meeting up together down at the church.<br> We want a rundown on the names|and the numbers of all the players.<br> Wait a minute. All right, you're nominated.<br> Why me, Charley?|I feel funny going down there.<br> I'd just be stooling for you.<br> Let me tell you what stooling is.|Stooling is when you rat on your friend...<br> ...the guys you're with.|Johnny wants a favour.<br> Don't think about it. Do it.<br> Go on. Join the congregation.<br> I thought there would be|more of you here, but....<br> The Romans found out what a handful|could do if it's the right handful.<br> I'm just a potato-eater,|but isn't it simple as one, two, three?<br> One. The working conditions are bad.<br> Two. They're bad|because the mob does the hiring.<br> Three. The only way to break the mob is|to stop letting them get away with murder.<br> If one of you'll answer one question,|we'd have a very good start.<br> And that question is:|Who killed Joey Doyle?<br> Not one of you has a line|on who killed Joey Doyle?<br> I have a hunch all of you|could tell us something about it.<br> All right, then answer this one:<br> How can we call ourselves Christians and|protect these murderers with our silence?<br> Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.<br> How can you just sit there|and not say anything?<br> I'll always think of him as my best friend,|but what do you want me to--<br> Who asked him in here?<br> I'm trying to find out|what happened to Joey Doyle.<br> -Maybe you can be helpful.|-Helpful?<br> The brother of Charley the Gent?<br> They'll help us get to the bottom|of the river.<br> You better leave Charley out of this.<br> -You don't think he'd be helpful?|-Why don't you ask him yourself?<br> -Maybe I will one of these days.|-One of these days.<br> Now, listen, you know who the pistols are.<br> Are you going to keep still|until they cut you down one by one?<br> Are you?<br> Dugan! How about you? Are you?<br> One thing you have to understand,|Father, on the dock...<br> ...we've always been D and D.<br> -D and D? What's that?|-Deaf and dumb.<br> No matter how much|we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.<br> Rat? Now boys, get smart.<br> I know you're getting pushed around,|but there's one thing...<br> ...we have in this country,|and that's ways of fighting back.<br> Getting the facts to the public.<br> Testifying for what is right against|what is wrong.<br> What's ratting to them is telling the truth|for you, can't you see that?<br> Can't you see that?<br> It seems to me we've gone just about|as far as we can at this time.<br> I think you'll agree with that, Father.<br> So, I'd like to close with a few words|from St. Matthew:<br> "Come unto me all you--"<br> What did I tell you|about sticking your neck out.<br> -This is a police problem, not ours.|-These people need help.<br> Okay. Only don't blame me when|they ship you off to Abyssinia.<br> I won't.<br> You better go home in pairs.|Twos is two, you know.<br> Come on.<br> Pop!<br> Edie!<br> What's happened to Pop?<br> He's all right.|He's an old man, they won't hurt him.<br> Get out, you!<br> Are you all right?<br> Yeah, considering they were using|my head for a baseball.<br> You still D and D?|Do you still call it ratting?<br> -Are you on the level?|-What do you think?<br> If I stick my neck out and it's chopped off,|is that the end?<br> -Or will you go all the way?|-Down the line.<br> They'll put muscle on you, too,|turned-around collar or not.<br> Wipe your face. Listen, you stand up|and I'll stand up with you.<br> -Right down the wire?|-So help me God.<br> I think we're okay.<br> Steel pipes and baseball bats.<br> They play pretty rough around here.<br> I can make it home now all right.<br> Which side are you with?<br> Me?
