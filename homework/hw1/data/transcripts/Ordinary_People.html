That's me #<br> Hey.<br> You drank too much.<br> I'm not drunk.<br> Why did you tell Annie<br> about Conrad's psychiatrist?<br> Why not?<br> People don't hear<br> that thing easily.<br> For most people.<br> It's a status symbol.<br> Well. Your blurting it out...<br> was a violation of privacy.<br> Whose privacy?<br> The family's privacy!<br> I think it is<br> a very private matter.<br> I tell you my dreams?<br> I don't believe in dreams.<br> What kind of<br> a psychiatrist are you?<br> What's happening?<br> What's going on?<br> I just feel...<br> I feel so...<br> What?<br> Jumpy. I don't know.<br> Look. Kiddo...<br> I lied.<br> I believe in dreams.<br> Sometimes I want to know<br> what's happening when you're awake.<br> Something's making you nervous.<br> Maybe I need a tranquilizer.<br> Tranquilizer?<br> What do you think?<br> You look like something<br> out of The Body Snatchers.<br> It's not my impression<br> that you need a tranquilizer.<br> What is this?<br> A clock.<br> You can tell the time.<br> But I can't.<br> So you know when<br> the hour's up?<br> Right.<br> Maybe I don't want<br> to swim anymore.<br> My timing is for shit.<br> Two guys better than me<br> swim the 50.<br> They're a bunch of boring jocks.<br> And him...<br> I can't stand him.<br> Thought about quitting?<br> You telling me to?<br> Nope.<br> It wouldn't look good.<br> How does it feel?<br> How does it feel?<br> Yes.<br> How does it feel?<br> It's the same damn thing<br> I did last year.<br> Are you the same<br> person now?<br> That's why you need<br> a tranquilizer?<br> You're a doctor.<br> I'm supposed to<br> feel better. Right?<br> Not necessarily.<br> Is it getting any easier<br> with your friends?<br> No. It's still hard.<br> Is anyplace easy?<br> The hospital was.<br> It was? Why?<br> Because nobody<br> hid anything there.<br> Was there anyone there<br> you could talk to?<br> Uh-huh.<br> I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?<br> Uh-huh.<br> Whoa!<br> Hi.<br> Karen!<br> How are you?<br> Good.<br> Sit down. Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Wow.<br> When did you get back?<br> The end of August.<br> Good.<br> It's great to see you.<br> Oh. You. Too.<br> Listen. I've got a meeting<br> over at the school.<br> Drama Club meeting.<br> We're doing<br> A Thousand Clowns.<br> You know it?<br> Anyway. We're going crazy<br> getting it together.<br> Don't let me hang you up.<br> No. I wanted to see you.<br> I didn't know what to expect.<br> You sounded funny on the phone.<br> It was just a gray day.<br> Everything's great.<br> I'm on the swim team.<br> Oh. You're swimming?<br> Terrific. Conrad.<br> That's really wonderful.<br> I could be benched all year.<br> You'll do great.<br> I'll bet your folks<br> are real proud of you.<br> Yeah.<br> What can I get you?<br> Are you hungry?<br> Just a coke.<br> Two cokes. Please.<br> Did we offend him?<br> Something I said?<br> A low self-image day.<br> So. Uh...<br> - Are you...<br> - What did...<br> I can't believe<br> how beautiful you look.<br> You really look beautiful.<br> So do you.<br> Do you miss it?<br> Miss what?<br> The hospital.<br> No.<br> Thank you.<br> You don't miss it?<br> No.<br> You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?<br> Are you seeing a doctor?<br> Yeah. I'm seeing one. Are you?<br> Uh. Dr. Crawford gave me a name.<br> I went for a while.<br> It didn't work.<br> He told me the things<br> I already knew.<br> Finally. I decided...<br> the only one who<br> can help me is myself.<br> At least. That's what<br> my dad says.<br> If it's something<br> you want to do.<br> That's what you<br> should be doing.<br> I don't know<br> how long I'll keep it up.<br> Your hair grew in.<br> Oh. That was such<br> a dumb thing to do.<br> I like it.<br> You do?<br> Yeah.<br> I don't know.<br> I just...<br> I miss it sometimes.<br> The hospital.<br> I really do.<br> Things have to change. You know?<br> But that's where we laughed.<br> But that was a hospital.<br> This is the real world.<br> I guess you're right.<br> I really have to go.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I have a meeting at the school.<br> We're doing A Thousand Clowns.<br> You told me.<br> Did I?<br> Yeah.<br> I better hurry.<br> Don't want to be late.<br> Thanks for seeing me.<br> Conrad?<br> Let's have a great Christmas.<br> Okay?<br> Let's have...<br> a great year.<br> Let's have the best year<br> of our lives.<br> This could be<br> the best year ever.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Will you call me?<br> Yeah.<br> You mean it?<br> Yep.<br> You. Uh...<br> You look good. Conrad.<br> Yeah.<br> Bye.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Hey!<br> Would you cheer up?<br> It's cold.<br> You should put that on.<br> Do you want a sweater?<br> Do I need one?<br> What are you doing?<br> Nothing.<br> Thinking.<br> About what?<br> Not about anything.<br> Your hair is starting to grow out.<br> It's looking... looking better.<br> I was thinking<br> about the pigeon...<br> that hung around the garage.<br> How it used to get<br> on top of your car.<br> Oh. Yeah.<br> I remember.<br> I remember<br> how scared I got...<br> That wsssshhhhh!<br> Flap. Flap. Flap...<br> Every time I started the car.<br> That was the closest<br> we came to having a pet.<br> Buck tried to talk you<br> into getting a dog.<br> He said. "If it's the size<br> of a football?"<br> You know.<br> That animal next door...<br> that Pepper or Pippin...<br> Pippin. Pippin. Pippin.<br> He's not friendly...<br> whatever Mr. McGreary says.<br> He wanted the retriever.<br> Each time that dog comes here.<br> I try to get him out.<br> Arf!<br> Arf! Arf!<br> Put that on<br> if you're staying out here.<br> Can I help?<br> With this?<br> No.<br> I will.<br> You can go to your room...<br> and clean the closet.<br> Mom.<br> Okay?<br> Because it's really a mess.<br> [Telephone Rings]<br> [Telephone Rings]<br> [Ring]<br> Hello.<br> Oh. Hi.<br> I didn't get there.<br> How did it go?<br> No. I'm not doing anything.<br> Just getting dinner ready.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Did she really?<br> Mary Ann Ramon started<br> just to scream. Right?<br> We got so drunk.<br> We couldn't talk.<br> It was the last day of school.<br> We walked out<br> of the building.<br> Oh, Bucky.<br> No. Stop!<br> What do you expect from her?<br> We just don't connect.<br> Why not?<br> We just don't.<br> What are you thinking?<br> That I jack off a lot.<br> So what else is new?<br> Does it help?<br> For a minute.<br> What now?<br> John-Boy.<br> Who?<br> John-Boy on<br> The Waltons.<br> Yeah.<br> What about him?<br> After Buck died.<br> Dad came to my room.<br> He didn't<br> know what to say.<br> He put his<br> arm around me.<br> We just sat there.<br> I remember watching his shoe.<br> And thinking...<br> His shoe was turned<br> over on its side.<br> I was thinking. He's so uptight!<br> It's gonna crack off.<br> I knew I should've<br> felt something.<br> I didn't know what to feel.<br> On TV. They say stuff<br> like. "Oh. No!"<br> But I didn't say that...<br> because I didn't feel sad...<br> so much as...<br> So much as what?<br> I kept thinking John-Boy<br> would've said something...<br> about how he felt.<br> What would he say?<br> I don't know.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on what?<br> Don't hold back.<br> Well. At least<br> she's an improvement.<br> That's what you get...<br> when your partner<br> does the hiring.<br> That's my fault.<br> I can't tell anybody...<br> that they're not making it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> That's not the problem.<br> Where are you?<br> What?<br> I've been losing you these days.<br> Oh. I'm sorry.<br> That's okay.<br> That's okay.<br> You off the track?<br> Huh?<br> Come on.<br> I've known you for 20 years.<br> Is something wrong?<br> How's Connie?<br> Connie's all right.<br> He is. He's okay.<br> It's none of my business...<br> but you worry too much.<br> You've been on the rack<br> about him long enough.<br> I'm not on the rack about him.<br> In a year. He'll be gone.<br> Off to Michigan<br> or wherever he wants to go.<br> Maybe he'll tour Europe.<br> Who knows?<br> I can't argue with "Who knows."<br> I'm giving you the benefit<br> of my experience.<br> Thanks.<br> Valerie isn't just<br> living away from home...<br> she's gone.<br> Got her own friends.<br> Her own life.<br> She breezes in<br> a few days on vacations.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe girls are different.<br> Or maybe she<br> was too aware...<br> of what was happening<br> between Nance and me.<br> But they leave. And that<br> worrying's just wasted energy.<br> [Young Conrad]<br> Give me back my sweater!<br> Hang on.<br> [Bucky]<br> Dad, what's possession?<br> Give it to me!<br> It's already on me.<br> Whose sweater is it?<br> It's my sweater!<br> I'll give it back...<br> if you give me my skis.<br> All right.<br> Conrad! Conrad!<br> What?<br> [Man]<br> Watch your back.<br> Cuts are vertical.<br> He really meant business.<br> Let's go.<br> [Conductor]<br> Lake Forest is next.<br> Lake Forest.<br> [Laughing]<br> What do you want?<br> I don't know<br> what else to do.<br> I'm not asking for anything.<br> You're kidding me.<br> I don't get it.<br> You're excused from practice...<br> to see some shrink;<br> I work with you<br> at your convenience.<br> What more should I do?<br> Nothing.<br> A bright kid like you.<br> I don't get it.<br> Why keep messing up your life?<br> I don't think that<br> quitting swimming...<br> will mess up my life.<br> Okay.<br> Okay. Now. This is it.<br> Yeah.<br> You're a big kid.<br> Actions have consequences.<br> I'm not taking you back.<br> I won't ask you to.<br> [Laughing]<br> What happened?<br> You all right?<br> Yeah.<br> You quit the swim team.<br> Yeah.<br> Why?<br> It was a bore.<br> That's no reason!<br> What's going on?<br> Nothing.<br> Talk to me.<br> Swimming's a bore. That's all.<br> I talked to...<br> Quit talking to people!<br> Okay?<br> Holy shit.<br> Yeah. Sure.<br> Fuck you. Jarrett.<br> Ooh! Ohh!<br> Shut up.<br> Leave it alone.<br> I told you. The guy's a flake.<br> - What did your dad say?<br> - I haven't told him.<br> How come?<br> The timing isn't right.<br> He sweats everything.<br> He'll just get worried.<br> Can you tell your mother?<br> My mother?<br> I told you we don't connect.<br> What do people have<br> in common with mothers anyway?<br> It's all surface junk.<br> You know?<br> "Clean your room.<br> Brush your teeth...<br> get good grades."<br> I'm not feeling anything today.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No. Sorry's out.<br> Something's on your mind.<br> What time is it?<br> Never mind. There's time.<br> Remember the contract?<br> Control?<br> Maybe there's some connection...<br> between control<br> and lack of feeling.<br> I said I feel things.<br> When?<br> Come on.<br> When?<br> Sometimes. I don't know.<br> I thought you didn't<br> like fooling around.<br> What do you want?<br> Don't say. "I don't know."<br> Should I make up answers?<br> Make one up about<br> there's no feelings there.<br> I have feelings.<br> Get it together. Jarrett.<br> You're trying to make me mad.<br> Are you mad?<br> No!<br> You don't like being pushed.<br> Do something about it!<br> What?<br> No. I can't do this.<br> Why not?<br> Getting mad takes too much energy.<br> It takes more holding it back.<br> When I let myself feel.<br> I feel lousy.<br> # I never promised you<br> a rose garden #<br> Fuck you. Berger.<br> Fuck you.<br> Yeah?<br> That's it.<br> What do you feel?<br> Do you jack off?<br> What do you think?<br> You married a fat lady...<br> and you fuck<br> the daylights out of her!<br> Sounds good to me.<br> Little advice<br> about feeling...<br> Don't expect it always to tickle.<br> Do you know how<br> to aim that?<br> Be quiet. I have to concentrate.<br> Be quiet.<br> Is it in focus?<br> Smile. Smile.<br> Okay. Good.<br> I want to take<br> the three young ones.<br> Dad.

Smile.<br> Calvin!<br> Smile.<br> Give me the camera.<br> Give me the camera.<br> I want a really good picture.<br> I want a shot of you three men.<br> Not until I get you two.<br> Give her<br> the goddamn camera!<br> Smile.<br> Who's hungry?<br> I'll make the sandwiches.<br> [Crash]<br> Beth!<br> It can be saved.<br> That was so dumb.<br> I don't think<br> he's happy in school.<br> Have you talked to his teachers?<br> People don't want<br> to be with him.<br> He provokes people.<br> Well. It's an awkward age.<br> Thank you.<br> Maybe he needs a change.<br> Is he eating enough?<br> Yes. Mother.<br> He'll be all right.<br> If you're firm with him.<br> I think he should<br> go away to school.<br> I can't deal with him.<br> Who'd make that decision?<br> I suppose this doctor he's seeing.<br> What sort of doctor...<br> would make that decision for you?<br> A psychiatrist.<br> I thought that was finished.<br> No.<br> What's his name?<br> Berger.<br> Jewish doctor?<br> I suppose he's Jewish.<br> Maybe just German.<br> What does Cal say<br> about all this?<br> This can be saved.<br> It's a nice clean break.<br> # Amen.

Jeannine.<br> This is Bill.<br> Uuuuugh!<br> Hello.<br> Hello. This is...<br> Hello. This is Conrad calling.<br> Jarrett.<br> Oh.<br> Oh. Hi!<br> Listen. I was...<br> I was wondering<br> if maybe you'd like...<br> to go out sometime.<br> Like on a date?<br> We wouldn't have<br> to call it a date.<br> We could see how it goes.<br> That was dumb.<br> Now start over.<br> This is Conrad Jarrett.<br> I'd love to. When?<br> I didn't see you.<br> What do you think?<br> Fine.<br> Rawlins used to have<br> great scotch pines.<br> They look like<br> skeletons this year.<br> Hi. What do you think?<br> It's very nice.<br> What is wrong?<br> Ask him what's wrong.<br> Maybe you won't have to<br> hear it from Carol Lazenby.<br> Hear what?<br> I quit the swim team.<br> Carol thought I knew.<br> It happened over a month ago.<br> Quit? When?<br> Where have you been every night?<br> Nowhere.<br> The library mostly.<br> I didn't think it mattered.<br> That was meant for me.<br> It's important to hurt me. Right?<br> You have that backwards.<br> Do I embarrass you<br> in front of friends?<br> "Poor Beth believes<br> every lie her son tells."<br> I didn't lie.<br> You did when<br> you came home at 6:30!<br> If the lying's starting again.<br> I can't stand it!<br> Then go to Europe!<br> She only gives a fuck because<br> someone else knew about it first!<br> She never came<br> to the hospital...<br> because she's busy going<br> to goddamn Spain and Portugal!<br> She doesn't care if I'm hung up<br> by the balls out there.<br> They may talk like this<br> at the hospital...<br> but we're not at the hospital.<br> You never came to the hospital!<br> She had the flu<br> and couldn't come inside.<br> She would've visited Buck<br> in the hospital!<br> Buck never would've been<br> in the hospital!<br> That is enough!<br> I won't do it again.<br> What in hell has happened?<br> Somebody better go up there.<br> He walks all over us...<br> then you apologize to him.<br> You've been apologizing to him...<br> since he returned from the hospital!<br> I'm trying to<br> goddamn understand him!<br> Don't talk to me...<br> the way he talks to you.<br> Let's not fight. Okay?<br> No fighting. Okay?<br> Please.<br> Let's go upstairs.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> I didn't mean any of it.<br> Please don't be mad.<br> I'm trying to<br> understand what happened.<br> I don't know what happened.<br> I didn't mean it.<br> Tell her I'm sorry. Will you?<br> Why don't you?<br> God. I can't!<br> I can't talk to her!<br> Why not?<br> It doesn't change anything.<br> It doesn't change<br> the way she looks at me.<br> She was hurt because<br> you quit the team.<br> I don't mean just now.<br> I don't mean just today.<br> Explain it to me.<br> I can't. You don't see things.<br> What things?<br> What things?<br> I want you to tell me.<br> Can't you see she hates me?<br> She doesn't hate you.<br> You're right.<br> She doesn't.<br> Please leave me alone.<br> Do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?<br> It's not his fault.<br> I'll be downstairs if you need me.<br> Tuesday everything was hunky-dory.<br> You're the doctor.<br> Don't take refuge<br> in one-liners. Okay?<br> Because that pisses me off.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Everything was fine...<br> till you had the fight<br> with your mother?<br> I don't blame her.<br> She's got her reasons.<br> It's impossible...<br> after all the shit I've pulled.<br> What shit have you pulled?<br> I'm talking about proportion.<br> Now. What shit?<br> You can find one example.<br> Don't say you tried suicide.<br> What have you done lately?<br> I'll never be forgiven for that.<br> Never.<br> You can't get out<br> the blood in her towels...<br> and in her rug.<br> Everything<br> had to be pitched.<br> The bathroom tile<br> had to be regrouted.<br> She fired the maid...<br> because she couldn't dust right.<br> If you think I'll forgive...<br> she's gonna forgive me...<br> What?<br> I think I just figured<br> something out.<br> What?<br> Who it is who can't forgive who.<br> [Berger]<br> A real problem has a real solution.<br> [Conrad]<br> I've heard this before.<br> Doesn't make it any less true.<br> I'm so tired.<br> That's some secret<br> you've been keeping.<br> So what do I do now?<br> Recognize her limitations.<br> Like she can't love me.<br> No. Like she can't<br> love you enough.<br> Don't blame her<br> for not loving you...<br> more than she's able.<br> She loves my father.<br> She loved my brother.<br> It's me.<br> We're back to<br> the rotten kid routine.<br> She can't love you<br> because you're unlovable.<br> How come your Dad loves you?<br> He feels responsible.<br> Besides. He loves everybody.<br> The guy's got no taste.<br> He loves you. But he's wrong.<br> Look...<br> maybe she can't express it...<br> the way you'd like.<br> Maybe she's afraid<br> to show her feelings.<br> What do you mean?<br> There's someone<br> besides your mother...<br> you've got to forgive.<br> You mean me?<br> For trying to off myself?<br> Don't stare.<br> What for?<br> Why don't you let yourself<br> off the hook?<br> What did I do?<br> What did I do?<br> We'll talk Thursday.<br> Come on!<br> Time's up.<br> What did I do?<br> You know the rules.<br> What rules?<br> Think about it.<br> Just think about it.<br> Jesus!<br> Say. After going to a new high...<br> it falls to 1121/4...<br> and then rallies on good volume.<br> I order to buy 4.000.<br> If I get the 4.000 at 1133/4.<br> I know something's wrong.<br> But suppose I order<br> to buy the 4.000 shares...<br> and I plug in at 1133/4...<br> I get 2.000 at 114.<br> and the rest on the way up.<br> Then I know I'm right.<br> I'm going to peel off here.<br> See you later.<br> [Voice Echoing]<br> Suppose the order to buy...<br> [Beth's Voice]<br> You let him walk all over us...<br> and you apologize.<br> [Man's Voice]<br> [Conrad's Voice]<br> Dad, you don't see things.<br> [Beth]<br> You've been apologizing...<br> since he returned from the hospital.<br> Tell her to stop it!<br> Buck never would've<br> been in the hospital!<br> She hates me!<br> I want to be clear.<br> That's good.<br> In the car.<br> I was thinking. "be clear."<br> I suppose that's what<br> psychiatry's about.<br> Being precise and clear.<br> And honest, of course.<br> I'm not a great believer<br> in psychiatry.<br> Okay.<br> What happens here<br> is between you and him...<br> and I respect that.<br> He's better.<br> I can see that.<br> I just don't believe in psychiatry...<br> as a panacea for everybody.<br> Neither do I.<br> I wish I knew what<br> I was doing here.<br> You said you could shed<br> some light on some things.<br> I meant in terms of Conrad.<br> I knew something was wrong...<br> even before he tried suicide.<br> But I thought that...<br> It's clear that he's very smart.<br> He's always been<br> an "A" student.<br> Naturally. I thought<br> intelligent people...<br> could work out their problems.<br> But you still feel responsible?<br> Yeah, sure I do.<br> It's hard not to.<br> It was just luck that<br> I happened to be there...<br> when he tried it.<br> We both could've been away.<br> You think of yourself<br> as a lucky man?<br> No. No. No.<br> I used to think that<br> I was a lucky person...<br> before the accident.<br> I guess the whole of life...<br> is nothing but an accident...<br> what happens to you.<br> That sounds like<br> the philosophy of a drifter.<br> Yeah. Maybe.<br> Maybe I am drifting a little.<br> I can see the two of them...<br> drifting away from me...<br> and I just stand watching.<br> What would you want<br> to do about that?<br> Something.<br> I don't know what.<br> I feel like<br> I'm sitting on a fence.<br> They're on opposite sides<br> of this fence?<br> Yeah... No.<br> I don't know.<br> I see her not being able<br> to forgive him.<br> For what?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> Being too much like her.<br> People always think that<br> she and Buck are... were alike.<br> But it's really she and Conrad.<br> They were the only two...<br> that didn't cry at the funeral.<br> It's not easy for me to admit this...<br> but. Um...<br> she didn't...<br> His mother doesn't<br> show him much affection.<br> I'm not trying<br> to put her down.<br> Did she give Buck<br> much affection?<br> God. Yes.<br> She loved Buck.<br> Bucky got so much.<br> What she felt for him was special.<br> He was her first-born.<br> And you?<br> I loved Buck.<br> I mean your wife's affection.<br> For me?<br> Yes.<br> She's very...<br> No. There's no problem<br> with her for me.<br> We've been married<br> nearly 21 years.<br> Everybody loves Beth.<br> For Conrad. It's been difficult.<br> He didn't talk about that?<br> We don't know what happens here.<br> It doesn't come up.<br> I guess that's what it is.<br> It's private here. Isn't it?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Very private.<br> I think I know why I came here.<br> I think I came here<br> to talk about myself.<br> Okay. Why don't we?<br> Hi.<br> [Car Buzzer Alarm]<br> Calvin?<br> [Buzzing Continues]<br> What's the matter?<br> This will sound strange.<br> What I'm going to say<br> will sound strange.<br> What happened?<br> Come inside.<br> Could we talk about<br> Buck's funeral?<br> What?<br> It'll seem trivial.<br> But it's on my mind.<br> I'd like to talk about it.<br> When I was getting dressed<br> for Buck's funeral...<br> What could getting dressed<br> for Buck's funeral...<br> have to do with anything?<br> I was wearing a blue shirt.<br> You said. "Wear a white shirt<br> and other shoes."<br> It was nothing. But<br> it seemed to stay with me.<br> What difference did it make...<br> what I wore to Buck's funeral?<br> Hear me out. Beth!<br> No one would listen to that.<br> I just want to talk about it.<br> Why do you want to remind me?<br> Because I've wondered what<br> it mattered what I wore.<br> I was crazy that day.<br> We were going<br> to our son's funeral.<br> You were worried about<br> what I wore on my feet.<br> It sticks with me...<br> and I wanted to<br> tell you about it.<br> It's all right.<br> Beth! How are you?<br> Fine. How are you?<br> I haven't seen you.<br> I'll call you. How's Brad?<br> Fabulous! Is everything okay?<br> Isn't this madness?<br> It gets worse every year.<br> Good-bye.<br> May I show you this in your size?<br> What?<br> May I show you this?<br> Oh. No. No. Thanks.<br> Bennetts. Grants. And Foleys.<br> Conrad should get something<br> for my parents.<br> He's not getting something<br> for his doctor. Is he?<br> We should go see Dr. Berger.<br> What?<br> We could all go see him.<br> Why?<br> He thinks it's a good idea.<br> What's he know about me?<br> I've never even met him.<br> Wouldn't it be easier<br> if we all talked about it?<br> What will we talk about?<br> Don't try to change me.<br> Hasn't enough happened?<br> Let's hold on to what we've got.<br> That's what this is for.<br> Maybe you'll be surprised.<br> I don't want surprises.<br> I know I'm not perfect.<br> If I can't hug everybody<br> like you. I'm sorry.<br> You're missing the point.<br> I don't want to see counselors.<br> This is my family.<br> We will solve our problems...<br> in the privacy of our own home...<br> not by running to some...<br> Ready to order?<br> Could you give me<br> a few minutes?<br> Running to experts every time<br> something goes wrong.<br> I know you mean well.<br> I want this to be<br> a nice Christmas.<br> I want them all to be nice.<br> You and I need time together.<br> We must get away.<br> New Years'. We'll spend<br> time in Houston...<br> with my brother.<br> Play some golf. Relax.<br> I've talked to Mother.<br> Conrad can stay with them.<br> Please don't worry about it.<br> Please. For his sake.<br> Don't indulge him.<br> We need time together.<br> Okay?<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> I love you.<br> I love you. Too.<br> Let's just give things time. Okay?<br> Okay.<br> Conrad.<br> Hmm?<br> I don't bowl.<br> I'm a horrible bowler.<br> That's all right.<br> Yeah. Well...<br> I got it.<br> The thing is.<br> I'm a funny bowler.<br> Listen. We don't<br> have to go bowling.<br> I'm not a bowling nut.<br> How funny are you?<br> On a scale from 1 to 10...<br> About a 10.<br> That's pretty funny.<br> I promise you won't look silly.<br> Guarantee it?<br> Guarantee it.<br> Can you break the ball?<br> Can't break anything<br> in a bowling alley.<br> That's what I like<br> about bowling alleys.<br> Can't even break the record.<br> Anyway...<br> Hmm? What?<br> It's a conversation starter.<br> Catchy.<br> You like it?<br> I've been working on it all day.<br> Are people punished<br> for things they do?<br> By God?<br> Yeah.<br> I don't believe in God.<br> Not at all?<br> Either you do or don't.<br> I believe in God.<br> You afraid he'll punish you<br> for something?<br> I've done many things<br> I'm ashamed of.<br> Yeah? So have I.<br> Did it hurt?<br> I don't remember really.<br> You don't want<br> to talk about it?<br> I've never really<br> talked about it.<br> To doctors.<br> But not to anyone else.<br> You're the first who's asked.<br> Why did you do it?<br> Uh...<br> I don't know.<br> It was like...<br> falling into a hole.<br> It was like falling into a hole.<br> It keeps getting bigger...<br> and you can't escape.<br> All of a sudden, it's inside...<br> and you're the hole.<br> You're trapped.<br> And it's all over.<br> Something like that.<br> It's not really scary...<br> except when<br> you think back on it.<br> 'Cause you know<br> what you were feeling...<br> # Like McDonald's can #<br> # Nobody can do it #<br> # Like McDonald's can #<br> # You deserve<br> a break today #<br> # So get up<br> and get away #<br> Hey. Jarrett.<br> How you doing?<br> How about some fries?<br> What are you doing?<br> Hey. Lighten up.<br> Hey. I don't like your attitude.<br> Energetic. Those guys.<br> They were pretty funny.<br> No.<br> You thought they were.<br> No. L...<br> I'm sorry.<br> What for?<br> Anyway...<br> Do you want to talk?<br> About what?<br> Are you okay?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah. I'm fine.<br> I'll give you a call.<br> Will you? I want you to.<br> Sure.<br> Well...<br> I'll see you in choir.<br> Okay. Yeah.<br> Thanks.<br> Okay.<br> I mean. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Seven.<br> In preparation<br> for our landing in Houston,<br> observe the fasten<br> seat belt sign,<br> and no smoking until<br> well inside the terminal.<br> Watch this.<br> Pessimistic golfer.<br> Pessimistic golfer.<br> Oh. Damn!<br> Are we two up?<br> Two.<br> Let's hustle up.<br> It is flat here.<br> But we decided<br> to teach you to love it.<br> He wants everybody to move here.<br> It's good to see you.<br> - You look tired. Cal.<br> - Airplane scotch.<br> Why am I still hungry?<br> 'Cause you're in Texas.<br> We'll get you home.<br> Get some steaks on.<br> A baked potato. Too?<br> How long has he had<br> that drawl?<br> Since joining the club.<br> [Laughing]<br> It sure wasn't funny.<br> We weren't that bad.<br> I can't listen to that<br> Buck Jarrett lecture again.<br> He bugs me<br> when he does that.<br> Will he ever stop<br> kissing his picture?<br> Stillman. Shut up.<br> Connie. Want a ride?<br> Oh. No. Thanks.<br> We could've used you today.<br> I don't think so.<br> Nobody could've helped us.<br> I hear you got eyes for Pratt.<br> Made it with her yet?<br> Don't be a prick.<br> You're the prick.<br> You give me a goddamn<br> pain in the ass.<br> Connie. Come on!<br> Come on!<br> Connie!<br> Connie. That's enough.<br> No!<br> No!<br> Let go! Let go!<br> It's all right!<br> Just calm down.<br> You're crazy!<br> You know that?<br> Send him back<br> where he came from!<br> It's over. It's over.<br> All right!<br> Shit!<br> Here's your hat.<br> You want to talk?<br> The guy's a nothing.<br> He's a zero upstairs.<br> Since fourth grade,<br> you've known that.<br> So you look stupid...<br> when you let him get to you!<br> So I look stupid?<br> What's with you?<br> Why do you want<br> to be in this alone?<br> You know. I miss him. Too.<br> The three of us<br> were best friends.<br> It hurts too much<br> to be around you.<br> I got to go.<br> Yeah. Okay.<br> [Honk]<br> Hello.<br> Hello. Is Karen there?<br> She...<br> Bill.<br> Hello.<br> Is Karen there?<br> This is Conrad Jarrett.<br> I'm a friend of hers.<br> [Father]<br> Karen's dead.<br> What? What?<br> [Man]<br> She killed herself.<br> [Karen's Voice]<br> Let's have the best Christmas ever.<br> We can. You know.<br> We could have<br> the best year...<br> of our whole lives.<br> Get the sail down!<br> Keep it starboard!<br> Get the sail down!<br> Starboard!<br> Keep trying!<br> I can't! Let it out!<br> Let it out!<br> Just keep it starboard!<br> I can't!<br> Ahh!<br> Bucky!<br> Give me your hand!<br> We screwed up. Buddy!<br> Dad's gonna haul ass over this!<br> It ain't so goddamned funny!<br> Don't let go!<br> I won't. Buck!<br> Everything will be okay!<br> Hang on. Brother!<br> Don't let go!<br> Stay with me!<br> Stay with me!<br> Stay with me!<br> Oh. God!<br> Bucky!<br> Buck!<br> Buck!<br> [Berger]<br> Hello.<br> This is Conrad.<br> What's going on?<br> I need to see you.<br> Where are you?<br> I don't know.<br> All right.<br> Get to the office.<br> I'll meet you there.<br> Okay.<br> Good. You're here.<br> Something happened.<br> Just a minute.<br> Wait till we get inside.<br> There.<br> Shit.<br> You'd think they'd assume<br> there'd be emergencies.<br> Don't take it off.<br> Just sit down.<br> Something happened.<br> What?<br> It's...<br> It's what?<br> Oh. God!<br> I need something.<br> What?<br> It keeps coming.<br> I can't stop it!<br> Don't try.<br> Got to get off the hook.<br> For what?<br> What I did to him!<br> What?<br> It must be somebody's fault...<br> or there's no point!<br> What point? It happened!<br> Oh. No. I don't mean that.<br> It's just that...<br> Bucky. I didn't mean it.<br> Bucky, I didn't mean it.<br> Bucky!<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> You said. "Get the sail down!"<br> I couldn't! It jammed!<br> And then the halyard jammed!<br> Because the goddamned<br> halyard jammed!<br> Then you're sittin' here<br> screwing around!<br> Until it's too late!<br> And I'm supposed<br> to take care of it!<br> That wasn't fair.<br> No! And then<br> you say. "Hang on!"<br> "Hang on!"<br> Then you let go!<br> Why'd you let go?<br> I got tired!<br> Yeah? Well. Screw you. You jerk!<br> It hurts to be mad at him.<br> Yeah.<br> He just wasn't careful.<br> He didn't see how<br> a bad thing might happen.<br> Bad things happen even<br> when people are careful.<br> We should've come in...<br> when it started to look bad.<br> So you made a mistake.<br> Why did he let go?<br> Why?<br> Maybe you were stronger.<br> Did that ever occur to you?<br> How long will you<br> punish yourself?<br> When will you quit?<br> I'd like to.<br> Why don't you?<br> It's not that easy.<br> God...<br> I loved him.<br> I know.<br> What happened?<br> What started all this?<br> Karen.<br> She killed herself.<br> I just found out she's dead.<br> Jesus.<br> She was fine.<br> No. She wasn't.<br> She told me!<br> She said she was...<br> What?<br> She was busy and<br> feeling good and...<br> What?<br> What?<br> If I'd known...<br> I could've done something.<br> You're taking her on. Too?<br> No!<br> No?<br> No. I just...<br> What?<br> That isn't it.<br> I feel really bad about this.<br> Just let me feel bad about this!<br> Okay.<br> Listen. I feel<br> bad about it. Too.<br> Why do things<br> happen to people?<br> It isn't fair.<br> You're right.<br> It isn't fair.<br> You just do one wrong thing...<br> and...<br> Um-hmm.<br> And what was the one<br> wrong thing you did?<br> You know.<br> You know.<br> I hung on.<br> I stayed with the boat.<br> Exactly.<br> Now. You can live<br> with that. Can't you?<br> I'm scared!<br> I'm scared.<br> Feelings are scary.<br> And sometimes they're painful.<br> If you can't feel pain...<br> you won't feel<br> anything else.<br> You know what I'm saying?<br> I think so.<br> You're here. You're alive.<br> Don't say you don't feel that.<br> It doesn't feel good.<br> It is good.<br> Believe me.<br> How do you know?<br> Because I'm your friend.<br> I don't know<br> what I would've done...<br> if you hadn't been here.<br> You're really my friend?<br> I am. Count on it.<br> Hi.<br> I would've called...<br> but I didn't<br> want to wake anyone.<br> About the other night...<br> I liked being with you.<br> I didn't like myself.<br> Conrad. I was stupid.<br> That was dumb of me to laugh.<br> It was my fault.<br> I was embarrassed.<br> Really?<br> You were embarrassed?<br> When those boys came in...<br> it was awful and awkward.<br> When I'm embarrassed. I laugh.<br> They were just having<br> a good time.<br> I let them interfere<br> with what was happening.<br> It was dumb.<br> I've done lots of<br> dumb things lately.<br> I just didn't know if you were<br> being straight with me.<br> Yeah?<br> Anyway. I'd like<br> to try it again.<br> It worked okay...<br> except for the bowling.<br> Yes.<br> Yes?<br> Yes.<br> Are you going to school?<br> No. Not on Sunday.<br> Have you eaten?<br> No. I haven't.<br> Do you want some breakfast?<br> Okay.<br> Mom!<br> All right.<br> How about that?<br> Boy. Oh. Boy.<br> I do love that.<br> These holes sure do love you.<br> We should spend more time<br> playing golf together.<br> Maybe our next vacation...<br> strictly golf.<br> Pinehurst.<br> Myrtle Beach.<br> Pinehurst would be nice.<br> I think Connie would<br> like Pinehurst.<br> Is that deliberate<br> or just a reflex?<br> I assumed you meant him. Too.<br> I'm surprised you<br> haven't called him.<br> I'll call him tonight.<br> Can we have a little drink?<br> Drink. Yes. Little. No.<br> Let's finish this.<br> What?<br> What you started.<br> Me? There's no point.<br> He controls you.<br> He isn't the problem.<br> Isn't he?<br> No. Let's talk about<br> what's bothering you.<br> No. Let's discuss<br> what's bothering you.<br> How did I make you<br> so angry with me?<br> You blame me<br> for everything.<br> Can't you see<br> beyond yourself?<br> No. I can't!<br> Neither can you<br> or anybody else!<br> I'm just honest.<br> Stop being honest...<br> and start being generous!<br> Think about him!<br> What does he expect from me?<br> He wants a hug<br> when he passes exams?<br> I can't respond<br> when someone says...<br> "I did something<br> great. Love me."<br> He wants to know<br> you don't hate him.<br> Mothers don't hate their sons.<br> Is that what he told you?<br> You accept what he says<br> with no questions.<br> I'm trying to<br> keep this family...<br> What does everyone<br> want from me?<br> Listen. We all just<br> want you to be happy.<br> Happy?<br> Yes.<br> You tell me<br> the definition of happy.<br> First. Be sure your kids are safe...<br> that nobody's been hit by a car...<br> or drowned in your swimming pool!<br> Then tell me how to be happy!<br> I'm turning in.<br> Dinner was good.<br> Really good.<br> It's early. You tired?<br> It was a rough week.<br> Your grandmother<br> wasn't too tough on you?<br> No. She was fine.<br> I'm glad you're back.<br> Good night.<br> [Sobbing]<br> Calvin?<br> Why are you crying?<br> Can I. Uh...<br> Can I get you something?<br> I don't...<br> What did you say?<br> Calvin. What did you say?<br> [Sighing]<br> Tell me.<br> You are beautiful.<br> And you are unpredictable.<br> But you're so cautious.<br> You're determined. Beth...<br> but you know something?<br> You're not strong.<br> I don't know<br> if you're really giving.<br> Tell me something.<br> Do you love me?<br> Do you really love me?<br> I feel the way I've always<br> felt about you.<br> We would've been all right...<br> if there hadn't been any mess.<br> But you can't handle mess.<br> You need everything neat and easy.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe you can't love anybody.<br> It was so much Buck.<br> It's as if you buried<br> all your love with him.<br> I don't understand that.<br> Maybe it wasn't even Buck.<br> Maybe it was just you.<br> Maybe, finally, it was<br> the best of you that you buried.<br> But whatever it was...<br> I don't know who you are.<br> I don't know what<br> we've been playing at.<br> So I was crying.<br> Because I don't know<br> if I love you anymore.<br> And I don't know<br> what I'll do without that.<br> [Door Slams]<br> Dad?<br> The yard looks smaller<br> without leaves.<br> Dad. What happened?<br> Your mother's<br> going away for a while.<br> Where?<br> Why?<br> Back to Houston.<br> I don't know.<br> Why? What...<br> I know why.<br> It's me. Isn't it?<br> No.<br> It's my fault.<br> Don't do that to yourself!<br> It's nobody's fault!<br> Things happen.<br> People don't always have answers.<br> I don't know why<br> I'm yelling at you.<br> You should do<br> that more often.<br> Haul my ass a little.<br> Get after me.<br> Like you did for him.<br> He needed it.<br> You didn't.<br> You were always<br> so hard on yourself.<br> I never had the heart.<br> Oh. Dad. Don't.<br> Well. It's the truth.<br> I never worried about you.<br> I just wasn't listening.<br> I wasn't sending<br> many signals then.<br> You couldn't do anything.<br> I should've got<br> a handle on it somehow.<br> I used to figure you had<br> a handle for everything.<br> You knew it all.<br> You always made us feel<br> everything would be all right.<br> I've thought about that<br> a lot lately.<br> I really admire you for it.<br> Don't admire people too much.<br> They'll disappoint you sometimes.<br> I'm not disappointed.<br> I love you.<br> I love you. Too.<br>
