Fathers,<br> from hence trust not<br> your daughters minds<br> By what you see them act.<br> Is there not charms<br> By which the property<br> of youth and maidhood<br> May be abused?<br> Have you not read, Roderigo,<br> Of some such thing?<br> Yes, sir, I have indeed.<br> Call up my brother.<br> O, that you had had her!<br> Some one way, some another.<br> Do you know where we may apprehend her<br> and the Moor?<br> I think I can discover him,<br> if you please,<br> To get good guard<br> and go along with me.<br> Pray you, lead me on.<br> At every house Ill call;<br> I may command at most.<br> Get weapons, ho!<br> And raise<br> some special officers of night.<br> On, good Roderigo:<br> Ill deserve your pains.<br> Though in the trade of war<br> I have slain men,<br> Yet do I hold it very stuff<br> o the conscience<br> To do no contrived murder:<br> I lack iniquity<br> Sometimes to do me service:<br> Nine or ten times<br> I had thought to have yerkd him here<br> under the ribs.<br> Tis better as it is.<br> Nay, but he prated,<br> And spoke such scurvy<br> and provoking terms<br> Against your honour<br> That, with<br> the little godliness I have,<br> I did full hard forbear him.<br> But, I pray you, sir,<br> Are you fast married?<br> Be assured of this,<br> That the magnifico<br> is much beloved,<br> And hath in his effect<br> a voice potential<br> As double as the Dukes:<br> He will divorce you;<br> Or put upon you<br> what restraint and grievance<br> The law, with all<br> his might to enforce it on,<br> Will give him cable.<br> Let him do his spite:<br> My services which<br> I have done the signiory<br> Shall out-tongue<br> his complaints.<br> Tis yet to know...<br> Which, when I know<br> that boasting is an honour,<br> I shall promulgate...<br> I fetch my life and being<br> From men of royal siege,<br> and my demerits<br> May speak unbonneted<br> to as proud a fortune<br> As this that I have reachd: For know, Iago,<br> But that I love<br> the gentle Desdemona,<br> I would not my unhoused<br> free condition<br> Put into circumscription<br> and confine<br> For the seas worth.<br> But, look!<br> What lights come yond?<br> Those are the raised father<br> and his friends:<br> You were best go in.<br> Not I I must be found:<br> My parts, my title<br> and my perfect soul<br> Shall manifest me rightly.<br> Is it they?<br> By Janus, I think no.<br> The servants of the Duke,<br> and my lieutenant.<br> The goodness of the night<br> upon you, friends!<br> What is the news?<br> The Duke does greet you, general,<br> And he requires your<br> haste-post-haste appearance,<br> Even on the instant.<br> What is the matter,<br> think you?<br> Something from Cyprus<br> as I may divine:<br> It is a business of some heat: The galleys<br> Have sent<br> a dozen sequent messengers<br> This very night<br> at one anothers heels,<br> And many of the consuls,<br> raised and met,<br> Are at the Dukes already:<br> You have been hotly calld for;<br> When, not being<br> at your lodging to be found,<br> The Senate hath sent about three<br> several quests to search you out.<br> Tis well I am found by you.<br> I will but spend a word here<br> in the house,<br> And go with you.<br> Ancient,<br> what makes he here?<br> Faith, he to-night<br> hath boarded a land carack:<br> If it prove lawful prize,<br> hes made for ever.<br> I do not understand.<br> Hes married.<br> To who?<br> Marry, to...<br> Come, captain, will you go?<br> Have with you.<br> Here comes another troop<br> to seek for you.<br> It is Brabantio.<br> General, be advised;<br> He comes to bad intent.<br> Holla!<br> Stand there!<br> Signior, it is the Moor.<br> Down with him, thief!<br> You, Roderigo!<br> Come, sir,<br> I am for you.<br> Keep up your bright swords,<br> for the dew will rust them.<br> Good signior, you shall<br> more command with years<br> Than with your weapons.<br> O thou foul thief, where<br> hast thou stowd my daughter?<br> Damnd as thou art,<br> thou hast enchanted her;<br> For Ill refer me<br> to all things of sense,<br> If she in<br> chains of magic were not bound,<br> Whether a maid so tender,<br> fair and happy,<br> So opposite to marriage<br> that she shunned<br> The wealthy curled<br> darlings of our nation,<br> Could ever have,<br> to incur a general mock,<br> Run from her guardage<br> to the sooty bosom<br> Of such a thing as thou,<br> to fear, not to delight.<br> Judge me the world,<br> if tis not gross in sense<br> That thou hast practised<br> on her with foul charms,<br> Abused her delicate youth<br> with drugs or minerals<br> That weakens motion:<br> Ill havet disputed on;<br> Tis probable<br> and palpable to thinking.<br> I therefore apprehend<br> and do attach thee<br> For an abuser of the world,<br> a practiser<br> Of arts inhibited<br> and out of warrant.<br> Lay hold upon him:<br> If he do resist,<br> Subdue him at his peril.<br> Hold your hands,<br> Both you of my inclining,<br> and the rest:<br> Were it my cue to fight,<br> I should have known it<br> Without a prompter.<br> Where would you go<br> that I would go with you<br> To answer this your charge?<br> To prison, till fit time<br> Of law<br> and course of direct session<br> Call thee to answer.<br> What if I do obey?<br> How may the Duke<br> be therewith satisfied,<br> Whose messengers are here<br> about my side,<br> Upon some present<br> business of the state<br> To bring me to him?<br> Tis true,<br> most worthy signior;<br> The Dukes in council<br> and your noble self,<br> I am sure, is sent for.<br> How!<br> The Duke in council!<br> This time of the night!<br> Bring him away:<br> Mines not an idle cause:<br> The Duke himself,<br> Or any of my brothers<br> of the state,<br> Cannot but feel this wrong<br> as twere their own;<br> For if such actions<br> may have passage free,<br> Bond-slaves and pagans<br> shall our statesmen be.<br> There is no composition<br> in these news<br> That gives them credit.<br> Indeed,<br> they are disproportiond;<br> My letters say<br> a hundred and seven galleys.<br> And mine,<br> a hundred and forty.<br> But though they jump<br> not on a just account...<br> As in these cases,<br> where the aim reports,<br> Tis oft with difference...<br> yet do they all confirm<br> A Turkish fleet,<br> and bearing up to Cyprus.<br> Nay, it is<br> possible enough to judgment:<br> I do not so secure me<br> in the error,<br> But the main article I do approve<br> in fearful sense.<br> Now, whats the business?<br> The Ottomites,<br> reverend and gracious,<br> Steering with due course,<br> towards the isle of Rhodes.<br> Nay, in all confidence,<br> hes not for Rhodes.<br> How say you by this change?<br> This cannot be,<br> By no assay of reason.<br> There enjointed them<br> with an after fleet.<br> Ay, so I thought.<br> How many, as you guess?<br> Thirty sail:<br> And now they do restem<br> Their backward course,<br> bearing with frank appearance<br> Their purposes toward Cyprus.<br> Signior Montano,<br> Your trusty<br> and most valiant servitor,<br> In his free duty<br> recommends you thus,<br> And prays you to believe him.<br> Tis certain, then,<br> for Cyprus.<br> Here comes Brabantio<br> and the valiant Moor.<br> Valiant Othello,<br> we must straight employ you<br> Against<br> the general enemy Ottoman.<br> I did not see you;<br> welcome, gentle signior;<br> We lackd your counsel<br> and your help tonight.<br> So did I yours.<br> Good your grace, pardon me;<br> Neither my place nor aught<br> I heard of business<br> Hath raised me from my bed,<br> nor doth the general care<br> Take hold on me,<br> for my particular grief<br> Is of so flood-gate<br> and oerbearing nature<br> That it engluts<br> and swallows other sorrows<br> And yet is still itself.<br> Why, whats the matter?<br> My daughter!<br> O, my daughter!<br> Dead?<br> Ay, to me;<br> She is abused, stoln from me, and corrupted<br> By spells and medicines<br> bought of mountebanks;<br> For nature<br> so preposterously to err,<br> Being not deficient, blind,<br> or lame of sense,<br> Sans witchcraft<br> could not.<br> Whoeer he be<br> that in this foul proceeding<br> Hath thus beguiled<br> your daughter of herself<br> And you of her,<br> the bloody book of law<br> You shall yourself<br> read in the bitter letter<br> After your own sense,<br> yea, though our proper son<br> Stood in your action.<br> Humbly I thank your grace.<br> Here is the man, this Moor,<br> whom now, it seems,<br> Your special mandate<br> for the state-affairs<br> Hath hither brought.<br> We are very sorry fort.<br> What, in your own part,<br> can you say to this?<br> Nothing,<br> but this is so.<br> Most potent, grave,<br> and reverend signiors,<br> My very noble<br> and approved good masters,<br> That I have taen away<br> this old mans daughter,<br> It is most true;<br> true, I have married her:<br> The very head and front<br> of my offending<br> Hath this extent,<br> no more.<br> Rude am I in my speech,<br> And little blessd<br> with the soft phrase of peace:<br> For since these arms of mine<br> had seven years pith,<br> Till now some nine moons wasted,<br> they have used their dearest action<br> in the tented field,<br> And little of this great world can I speak,<br> More than pertains<br> to feats of broils and battle,<br> And therefore little shall<br> I grace my cause<br> In speaking for myself.<br> Yet, by your gracious patience,<br> I will a round<br> unvarnishd tale deliver<br> Of my whole course of love;<br> what drugs, what charms,<br> What conjuration<br> and what mighty magic,<br> For such proceeding<br> I am charged withal,<br> I won his daughter.<br> A maiden never bold;<br> Of spirit so still and quiet,<br> that her motion<br> Blushd at herself;<br> and she, in spite of nature,<br> Of years, of country,<br> credit, every thing,<br> To fall in love<br> with what she feard to look on!<br> It is a judgment<br> maimd and most imperfect<br> That will confess<br> perfection so could err<br> Against all rules of nature,<br> and must be driven<br> To find out<br> practises of cunning hell,<br> Why this should be.<br> I therefore vouch again<br> That with some mixtures<br> powerful oer the blood,<br> Or with some dram<br> conjured to this effect,<br> He wrought upon her.<br> To vouch this, is no proof,<br> Without more wider<br> and more overt test<br> Than these thin habits<br> and poor likelihoods<br> Of modern seeming<br> do prefer against him.<br> I do beseech you,<br> Send for the lady<br> to the Sagittary,<br> And let her speak of me<br> before her father:<br> If you do find me<br> foul in her report,<br> The trust, the office<br> I do hold of you,<br> Not only take away,<br> but let your sentence<br> Even fall upon my life.<br> Fetch Desdemona hither.<br> Ancient, conduct them:<br> You best know the place.<br> And, till she come,<br> as faithful as to heaven<br> I do confess the vices<br> of my blood,<br> So justly to your grave ears Ill present<br> How I did thrive<br> in this fair ladys love,<br> And she in mine.<br> Say it... ah...<br> Othello.<br> Her father loved me;<br> oft invited me;<br> Still questiond me<br> the story of my life,<br> From year to year,<br> the battles, sieges, fortunes,<br> That I have passed.<br> I ran it through,<br> even from my boyish days,<br> To the very moment<br> that he bade me tell it;<br> Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br> Of moving accidents<br> by flood and field<br> Of hair-breadth scapes<br> i the imminent deadly breach,<br> Of being taken<br> by the insolent foe<br> And sold to slavery,<br> of my redemption thence<br> And portance<br> in my travels history:<br> Wherein of antres vast<br> and deserts idle,<br> Rough quarries, rocks and hills<br> whose heads touch heaven<br> It was my hint to speak...<br> such was the process;<br> And of the Cannibals<br> that each other eat,<br> The Anthropophagi<br> and men whose heads<br> Do grow<br> beneath their shoulders.<br> This to hear<br> Would Desdemona<br> seriously incline:<br> But still the house-affairs<br> would draw her thence:<br> Which ever as she could<br> with haste dispatch,<br> Shed come again,<br> and with a greedy ear<br> Devour up my discourse:<br> Which I observing,<br> Took once a pliant hour,<br> and found good means<br> To draw from her<br> a prayer of earnest heart<br> That I would<br> all my pilgrimage dilate,<br> Whereof by parcels<br> she had something heard,<br> But not intentively:<br> I did consent,<br> And often did beguile her<br> of her tears,<br> When I did speak<br> of some distressful stroke<br> That my youth sufferd.<br> My story being done,<br> She gave me<br> for my pains a world of sighs:<br> She swore, in faith, twas<br> strange, twas passing strange,<br> Twas pitiful,<br> twas wondrous pitiful:<br> She wishd she had not heard it,<br> yet she wishd<br> That heaven had made her<br> such a man: She thankd me,<br> And bade me, if I had<br> a friend that loved her,<br> I should but teach him<br> how to tell my story.<br> And that would woo her.<br> Upon this hint I spake:<br> She loved me for the dangers<br> I had passd,<br> And I loved her<br> that she did pity them.<br> This only is the witchcraft<br> I have used:<br> Here comes the lady;<br> let her witness it.<br> I think this tale<br> would win my daughter too.<br> Good Brabantio,<br> Take up this<br> mangled matter at the best:<br> Men do their<br> broken weapons rather use<br> Than their bare hands.<br> I pray you, hear her speak:<br> If she confess<br> that she was half the wooer,<br> Destruction on my head,<br> if my bad blame<br> Light on the man!<br> Come hither, gentle mistress:<br> Do you perceive<br> in all this noble company<br> Where most you owe obedience?<br> My noble father, I do<br> perceive here a divided duty:<br> To you I am bound for life<br> and education;<br> My life and education<br> both do learn me<br> How to respect you;<br> you are the lord of all my duty;<br> I am hitherto your daughter:<br> But heres my husband,<br> And so much duty as my mother showd<br> to you, preferring you before her father,<br> So much I challenge<br> that I may profess<br> Due to the Moor my lord.<br> God be wi!<br> I have done.<br> Please it your grace,<br> on to the state-affairs:<br> I had rather to adopt a child than get it.<br> Come hither, Moor:<br> I here do give thee<br> that with all my heart<br> Which, but thou hast already,<br> with all my heart<br> I would keep from thee.<br> For your sake, jewel,<br> I am glad at soul<br> I have no other child:<br> For thy escape<br> would teach me tyranny,<br> To hang clogs on them.<br> I have done, my lord.<br> Let me speak like yourself,<br> and lay a sentence,<br> Which, as a grise or step,<br> may help these lovers<br> Into your favour.<br> When remedies are past,<br> the griefs are ended<br> By seeing the worst,<br> which late on hopes depended.<br> To mourn a mischief<br> that is past and gone<br> Is the next way<br> to draw new mischief on.<br> What cannot be preserved<br> when fortune takes<br> Patience her injury<br> a mockery makes.<br> The robbd that smiles<br> steals something from the thief;<br> He robs himself<br> that spends a bootless grief.<br> So let the<br> Turk of Cyprus us beguile;<br> We lose it not,<br> so long as we can smile.<br> He bears the sentence well<br> that nothing bears<br> But the free comfort<br> which from thence he hears,<br> But he bears<br> both the sentence and the sorrow<br> Which, to pay grief,<br> must of poor patience borrow.<br> These sentences, to sugar,<br> or to gall,<br> Being strong on both sides,<br> are equivocal:<br> But words are words;<br> I never yet did hear<br> That the bruised heart<br> was pierced through the ear.<br> I humbly beseech you,<br> proceed to the affairs of state.<br> The Turk with a most mighty preparation<br> makes for Cyprus.<br> Othello, the fortitude of<br> the place is best known to you;<br> and though we have there<br> a substitute<br> of most allowed sufficiency,<br> yet opinion,<br> a sovereign mistress<br> of effects,<br> throws a more<br> safer voice on you:<br> You must therefore be content<br> to slubber the gloss<br> of your new fortunes<br> with this more stubborn<br> and boisterous expedition.<br> The tyrant custom,<br> most grave senators,<br> Hath made the flinty<br> and steel couch of war<br> My thrice-driven bed of down:<br> I do agnise<br> A natural and prompt alacrity<br> I find in hardness,<br> and would undertake<br> This present wars<br> against the Ottomites.<br> Most humbly therefore<br> bending to your state,<br> I crave<br> fit disposition for my wife.<br> Due reference<br> of place and exhibition,<br> With such accommodation<br> and besort<br> As levels with her breeding.<br> If you please,<br> Bet at her fathers.<br> Ill not have it so.<br> Nor I.<br> Nor I;<br> I would not there reside,<br> To put my father<br> in impatient thoughts<br> By being in his eye.<br> Most gracious Duke,<br> To my unfolding<br> lend your prosperous ear;<br> And let me find<br> a charter in your voice,<br> To assist my simpleness.<br> What would You, Desdemona?<br> That I did love the Moor<br> to live with him,<br> My downright violence<br> and storm of fortunes<br> May trumpet to the world:<br> My hearts subdued<br> Even to<br> the very quality of my lord:<br> I saw Othellos visage<br> in his mind,<br> And to his honour and his valiant parts<br> Did I my soul<br> and fortunes consecrate.<br> So that, dear lords,<br> if I be left behind,<br> A moth of peace,<br> and he go to the war,<br> The rites for why<br> I love him are bereft me,<br> And I a heavy interim<br> shall support<br> By his dear absence.<br> Let me go with him.<br> Let her have your voice.<br> Vouch with me, heaven,<br> I therefore beg it not,<br> To please the palate<br> of my appetite,<br> Nor to comply with heat...<br> the young affects<br> In me defunct...<br> and proper satisfaction.<br> But to be free<br> and bounteous to her mind:<br> And heaven defend<br> your good souls,<br> that you think I will your serious<br> and great business scan<br> For she is with me:<br> No, when light-wingd toys<br> Of featherd Cupid<br> seal with wanton dullness<br> My speculative<br> and officed instruments,<br> That my disports<br> corrupt and taint my business,<br> Let housewives<br> make a skillet of my helm,<br> And all<br> indign and base adversities<br> Make head against<br> my estimation!<br> Be it as you shall privately determine,<br> Either for her stay or going:<br> The affair cries haste<br> and speed must answer it.<br> You must away to-night.<br> To-night, my lord?<br> This night.<br> With all my heart.<br> At nine i the morning here<br> well meet again.<br> Othello,<br> leave some officer behind,<br> And he shall<br> our commission bring to you;<br> With such things else<br> of quality and respect<br> As doth import you.<br> So please your grace,<br> my ancient;<br> A man he is of honesty<br> and trust:<br> To his conveyance<br> I assign my wife,<br> With what else needful<br> your good grace shall think<br> To be sent after me.<br> Let it be so.<br> Good night to every one.<br> And, noble signior,<br> If virtue<br> no delightful beauty lack,<br> Your son-in-law<br> is far more fair than black.<br> Adieu, brave Moor,<br> use Desdemona well.<br> Look to her, Moor,<br> if thou hast eyes to see:<br> She has deceived her father,<br> and may thee.<br> My life upon her faith!<br> Honest Iago, My Desdemona<br> must I leave to thee:<br> I prithee, let thy wife<br> attend on her:<br> And bring them after<br> in the best advantage.<br> Come, Desdemona:<br> I have but an hour<br> Of love, worldly matter<br> and direction,<br> To spend with thee:<br> We must obey the time.<br> Iago.<br> What sayst thou,<br> noble heart?<br> What will I do,<br> thinkest thou?<br> Why, go to bed, and sleep.<br> I will<br> incontinently drown myself.<br> Well, if thou dost, I shall<br> never love thee after it.<br> Why, thou silly gentleman!<br> It is silliness to live<br> when to live is torment;<br> and then have we<br> a prescription to die<br> when death is our physician.<br> O villainous!<br> I have looked upon this world<br> four times seven years;<br> and since<br> I could distinguish<br> betwixt a benefit<br> and an injury,<br> I never found man<br> that knew how to love himself.<br> Ere would I say,<br> I would drown myself<br> for the love of a guinea-hen,<br> I would change<br> my humanity with a baboon.<br> What should I do?<br> I confess it is my shame<br> to be so fond;<br> but it is not in my virtue<br> to amend it.<br> Virtue!<br> A fig!<br> Tis in ourselves<br> that we are thus or thus.<br> Our bodies are our gardens,<br> to the which<br> our wills are gardeners:<br> So that if we will plant nettles,<br> or sow lettuce,<br> set hyssop<br> and weed up thyme,<br> supply it with<br> one gender of herbs,<br> or distract it with many,<br> either to have it sterile with idleness,<br> or manured with industry, why,<br> the power and corrigible authority of this<br> lies in our wills.<br> If the balance of our lives<br> had not one scale of reason<br> to poise another of sensuality,<br> the blood and baseness<br> of our natures<br> would conduct us<br> to most preposterous conclusions:<br> But we have reason<br> to cool our raging motions,<br> our carnal stings,<br> our unbitted lusts,<br> whereof I take this that you call love<br> to be a sect or scion.<br> It cannot be.<br> It is merely<br> a lust of the blood<br> and a permission of the will.<br> Come, be a man.<br> Drown thyself!<br> Drown cats, blind puppies.<br> I have professed me thy<br> friend and I confess me<br> knit to thy deserving with cables<br> of perdurable toughness;<br> I could never better stead thee<br> than now.<br> Put money in thy purse;<br> follow thou the wars;<br> defeat thy favour<br> with an usurped beard;<br> I say,<br> put money in thy purse.<br> It cannot be long<br> that Desdemona<br> shall continue her love<br> unto the Moor...<br> put money in thy purse...<br> nor he his to her:<br> It was a violent<br> commencement in her,<br> and thou shalt see<br> an answerable sequestration...<br> put but money<br> in thy purse.<br> These Moors are changeable<br> in their wills:<br> Fill thy purse with money...<br> the food that to him now<br> is as luscious as locusts,<br> shall be to him shortly<br> as acerb as coloquintida.<br> She must change for youth:<br> When she is sated with his body,<br> she will find<br> the error of her choice:<br> Therefore<br> put money in thy purse.<br> If thou wilt needs damn thyself,<br> do it in a more delicate way<br> than drowning.<br> Make all the money thou canst:<br> If sanctimony and a frail vow<br> betwixt an erring barbarian<br> and a supersubtle Venetian<br> be not too hard for my wits<br> and all the tribe of hell,<br> thou shalt enjoy her;<br> therefore make money.<br> A pox on drowning thyself!<br> It is clean out of the way:<br> Seek thou rather to be hanged<br> in compassing thy joy than<br> be drowned and go without her.<br> Wilt thou be fast to my hopes,<br> if I depend on the issue?<br> Thou art sure of me...<br> go, make money...<br> I have told thee often,<br> and I re-tell thee again<br> and again, I hate the Moor:<br> My cause is hearted;<br> thine has no less reason.<br> Let us be conjunctive<br> in our revenge against him:<br> If thou canst cuckold him,<br> thou dost thyself a pleasure,<br> and me a sport.<br> There are many events<br> in the womb of time<br> which will be delivered.<br> Traverse!<br> Go, provide thy money.<br> Well have<br> more of this to-morrow.<br> Adieu.<br> Where shall we meet<br> i the morning?<br> At my lodging.<br> Ill be with thee betimes.<br> Go to; farewell.<br> Do you hear, Roderigo?<br> What say you?<br> No more of drowning,<br> do you hear?<br> I am changed.<br> Go to, fare well.<br> Provide thy money.<br> Ill sell all my land.<br> Thus do I ever make<br> my fool my purse:<br> For I mine own<br> gaind knowledge should profane,<br> If I would time expend<br> with such a snipe.<br> But for my sport and profit.<br> I hate the Moor:<br> And it is thought abroad,<br> that twixt my sheets<br> He has done my office:<br> I know not ift be true;<br> Yet I,<br> for mere suspicion of that kind,<br> Will do as if for surety.<br> He holds me well;<br> The better shall my purpose<br> work on him.<br> Cassios a proper man:<br> Let me see now:<br> To get his place<br> and to plume up my will<br> In the double knavery...<br> How, how?<br> Lets see...<br> After some time,<br> to abuse Othellos ear<br> That hes too familiar<br> with his wife.<br> He hath a person and<br> smooth dispose To be suspected,<br> framed to make women false.<br> The Moor<br> of free and open nature,<br> That thinks men honest<br> that but seem to be so,<br> And will be as tenderly<br> be led by the nose<br> As asses are.<br> I havet.<br> It is engenderd.<br> Hell and night<br> Must bring this monstrous birth<br> to the worlds light.<br> What from the cape<br> can you discern at sea?<br> Nothing at all:<br> It is a highwrought flood;<br> I cannot,<br> twixt the heaven and the main,<br> Descry a sail.<br> Methinks the wind<br> hath spoke aloud at land;<br> A fuller blast<br> neer shook our battlements:<br> If that the Turkish fleet<br> Be not enshelterd and embayd,<br> they are drownd:<br> It is impossible<br> they bear it out.<br> News, lads!<br> Our wars are done.<br> The desperate tempest<br> hath so bangd the Turks,<br> That their designment halts:<br> A noble ship of Venice<br> Hath seen<br> a grievous wreck and sufferance<br> On most part of their fleet.<br> How!<br> Is this true?<br> The ship is here put in,<br> A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,<br> Lieutenant to<br> the warlike Moor Othello,<br> Is come ashore:<br> The Moor himself at sea,<br> And is in full commission<br> here for Cyprus.<br> I am glad ont;<br> tis a worthy governor.<br> But this same Cassio,<br> though he speak of comfort<br> Touching the Turkish loss,<br> yet he looks sadly,<br> And prays the Moor be safe;<br> for they were parted<br> With foul and violent tempest.<br> Pray heavens he be;<br> For I have served him,<br> and the man commands like a full soldier.<br> Lets to the seaside, ho!<br> As well to see<br> the vessel thats come in<br> As to throw out our eyes<br> for brave Othello,<br> Even till we make the main<br> and the aerial blue an indistinct regard.<br> Come, lets do so:<br> For every minute is expectancy<br> of more arrivance.<br> Thanks, you the valiant<br> of this warlike isle,<br> That so approve the Moor!<br> O, let the heavens<br> Give him defence<br> against the elements,<br> For I have lost him<br> on a dangerous sea.<br> Is he well shippd?<br> His bark is stoutly timberd,<br> and his pilot<br> Of very expert<br> and approved allowance;<br> Therefore my hopes,<br> not surfeited to death,<br> Stand in bold cure.<br> The town is empty;<br> on the brow o the sea<br> Stand ranks of people,<br> and they cry A sail!<br> My hopes do shape him<br> for the governor.<br> They do discharge<br> their shot of courtesy:<br> Our friends at least.<br> I pray you, sir, go forth,<br> And give us truth<br> who tis that is arrived.<br> I shall.<br> But, good lieutenant,<br> is your general wived?<br> Most fortunately:<br> He hath achieved a maid<br> That paragons description<br> and wild fame;<br> One that excels the quirks<br> of blazoning pens,<br> And in the essential vesture<br> of creation<br> Does tire the ingener.<br> Now!<br> Who has put in?<br> One Iago,<br> ancient to the general.<br> Has had most favourable<br> and happy speed:<br> Tempests themselves,<br> high seas, and howling winds,<br> The gutterd rocks<br> and congregated sands...<br> Traitors ensteepd<br> to clog the guiltless keel...<br> As having sense of beauty, do omit<br> Their mortal natures,<br> letting go safely by<br> The divine Desdemona.<br> What is she?<br> She that I spake of,<br> our great captains captain,<br> Left in the conduct<br> of the bold Iago,<br> Whose footing here<br> anticipates our thoughts<br> A sennights speed.<br> Great Jove, Othello guard,<br> And swell his sail<br> with thine own powerful breath,<br> That he may bless this bay<br> with his tall ship,<br> Make loves quick pants<br> in Desdemonas arms,<br> Give renewd fire<br> to our extincted spirits<br> And bring all Cyprus comfort!<br> O, behold,<br> The riches of the ship<br> is come ashore!<br> Hail to thee, lady!<br> And the grace of heaven,<br> Before, behind thee,<br> and on every hand,<br> Enwheel thee round!<br> I thank you,<br> valiant Cassio.<br> What tidings<br> can you tell me of my lord?<br> He is not yet arrived:<br> Nor know I aught<br> But that hes well<br> and will be shortly here.<br> O, but I fear...<br> How lost you company?<br> The great contention<br> of the sea and skies<br> Parted our fellowship...<br> So speaks this voice.<br> See for the news.<br> Good ancient,<br> you are welcome.<br> Welcome, mistress.<br> Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,<br> That I extend my manners;<br> tis my breeding<br> That gives me this<br> bold show of courtesy.<br> Sir, would she give you<br> so much of her lips<br> As of her tongue<br> she oft bestows on me,<br> Youll have enough.<br> Alas, she has no speech.<br> I know too much.<br> I find it ay,<br> when I have list to sleep:<br> Marry, before your ladyship,<br> I grant,<br> She puts her tongue<br> a little in her heart,<br> And chides with thinking.<br> You have little<br> cause to say so.<br> Come on, come on;<br> you are pictures out of doors,<br> Bells in your parlors,<br> wild-cats in your kitchens,<br> Saints in your injuries,<br> devils being offended,<br> Players in your housewifery,<br> and housewives in your beds.<br> O, fie upon thee, slanderer!<br> Nay, it is true,<br> or else I am a Turk:<br> You rise to play and go to bed to work.<br> You shall not write my praise.<br> No, let me not.<br> What wouldst thou write of me,<br> if thou shouldst praise me?<br> O gentle lady,<br> do not put me tot;<br> For I am nothing,<br> if not critical.<br> Come on assay.<br> Theres one gone to the harbour?<br> Ay, madam.<br> I am not merry;<br> but do beguile<br> The thing I am,<br> by seeming otherwise.<br> Come, how wouldst thou<br> praise me?<br> I am about it;<br> but indeed my invention<br> Comes from my pate<br> as birdlime does from frize;<br> It plucks out brain and all:<br> But my Muse labours,<br> And thus it is deliverd.<br> If she be fair and wise,<br> fairness and wit,<br> The ones for use,<br> the other useth it.<br> Well praised!<br> How if black and witty?<br> If she be black,<br> and thereto have a wit,<br> Shell find a white<br> that shall her blackness fit.<br> Worse and worse.<br> How if fair and foolish?<br> She never yet<br> was foolish that was fair;<br> For even her folly<br> helpd her to an heir.<br> These are old fond paradoxes<br> to make fools<br> laugh i the alehouse.<br> Do not learn of him, Emilia,<br> though he be thy husband.<br> How say you, Cassio?<br> Is he not a most profane<br> and liberal counsellor?<br> He speaks home, madam:<br> You may relish him more in the soldier<br> than in the scholar.<br> He takes her by the palm:<br> Ay, well said, whisper:<br> With as little a web as this will<br> I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio.<br> Ay, smile upon her, do;<br> I will gyve thee<br> in thine own courtship.<br> You say true; tis so, indeed:<br> If such tricks as these<br> will strip you<br> of your lieutenantry,<br> it had been better you had not<br> kissed your<br> three fingers so oft,<br> which now again you are most apt<br> to play the sir in.<br> Very good; well kissed!<br> An excellent courtesy!<br> Tis so, indeed.<br> Yet again your fingers<br> are to your lips?<br> Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!<br> The Moor!<br> I know his trumpet.<br> Tis truly so.<br> Lets meet him and receive him.<br> Lo, where he comes!<br> O my fair warrior!<br> My dear Othello!<br> It gives me wonder<br> great as my content<br> To see you here before me.<br> O my souls joy!<br> If after every tempest<br> come such calms,<br> May the winds blow<br> till they have wakend death!<br> And let the labouring bark<br> climb hills of seas<br> Olympus-high<br> and duck again as low<br> As hells from heaven!<br> If it were now to die,<br> Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,<br> My soul hath<br> her content so absolute<br> That not another comfort<br> like to this<br> Succeeds in unknown fate.<br> The heavens forbid<br> But that our loves<br> and comforts should increase,<br> Even as our days do grow!<br> Amen to that,<br> sweet powers!<br> I cannot speak enough<br> of this content;<br> It stops me here;<br> it is too much of joy:<br> And this,<br> and this,<br> the greatest discords be<br> That eer our hearts shall make!<br> O, you are<br> well tuned now!<br> Ill set down the pegs<br> that make this music,<br> As honest as I am.<br> News, friends;<br> our wars are done,<br> the Turks are drownd.<br> How do my old acquaintance<br> of the isle?<br> Honey, you shall<br> be well desired in Cyprus;<br> I have found great love<br> amongst them.<br> O my sweet, I prattle<br> out of fashion, and I dote<br> In mine own comforts.<br> I prithee, good Iago,<br> Go to the bay<br> and disembark my coffers:<br> Bring thou the master<br> to the citadel;<br> He is a good one,<br> and his worthiness<br> Does challenge<br> much respect.<br> Come, Desdemona,<br> Once more,<br> well met at Cyprus.<br> Do thou meet me<br> presently at the harbour.<br> Come hither.<br> If thou best valiant...<br> as, they say,<br> base men being in love<br> than have a nobility<br> in their natures<br> more than is native to them...<br> list me.<br> The lieutenant tonight<br> watches on the court of guard...<br> first,<br> I must tell thee this...<br> Desdemona is<br> directly in love with him.<br> With him!<br> Why, tis not possible.<br> Lay thy finger thus,<br> and let thy soul be instructed.<br> Mark me with what violence<br> she first loved the Moor,<br> but for bragging and<br> telling her fantastical lies:<br> Love him still for prating?<br> Let not<br> thy discreet heart think so.<br> Her eye must be fed;<br> and what delight shall she have<br> to look on the devil?<br> When the blood is made dull<br> with the act of sport,<br> there should be,<br> again to inflame it<br> and to give satiety<br> a fresh appetite,<br> loveliness in favour,<br> sympathy in years,<br> manners and beauties;<br> all which the Moor is defective in:<br> Now, for want<br> of these required conveniences,<br> her delicate tenderness<br> will find itself abused,<br> begin to heave the gorge,<br> disrelish and abhor the Moor;<br> very nature<br> will instruct her in it<br> and compel her<br> to some second choice.<br> Now, sir, this granted...<br> as it is a most pregnant<br> and unforward position...<br> who stands eminent<br> in the degree of this fortune<br> as Cassio does?<br> A knave very voluble;<br> no further conscionable<br> than in putting on<br> the mere form<br> of civil<br> and humane seeming,<br> for the better compassing<br> of his salt<br> and most hidden<br> loose affections?<br> Why, none; why, none:<br> A slipper and subtle knave,<br> a finder out of occasion,<br> that has an eye can stamp<br> and counterfeit advantages,<br> though true advantage<br> never present itself;<br> a devilish knave.<br> Besides,<br> the knave is handsome, young,<br> and hath<br> all those requisites in him<br> that folly and green minds<br> look after:<br> A pestilent complete knave;<br> and the woman<br> hath found him already.<br> I cannot believe that in her;<br> shes full of<br> most blessed condition.<br> Blessed figs-end!<br> The wine she drinks<br> is made of grapes:<br> If she had been blessed,<br> she would never<br> have loved the Moor.<br> Blessed pudding!<br> Didst thou not see her paddle<br> with the palm of his hand?<br> Didst not mark that?<br> Yes, that I did;<br> but that was but courtesy.<br> Lechery, by this hand;<br> an index and obscure prologue<br> to the history of lust<br> and foul thoughts.<br> They met so near<br> with their lips<br> that their breaths<br> embraced together.<br> Villanous thoughts, Roderigo!<br> When these mutualities<br> so marshal the way,<br> hard at hand comes<br> the master and main exercise,<br> the incorporate conclusion, Pish!<br> But, sir, be you ruled by me:<br> I have brought you from Venice.<br> Watch you to-night;<br> for the command,<br> Ill layt upon you.<br> Cassio knows you not.<br> Ill not be far from you:<br> Find some occasion<br> to anger Cassio,<br> either by speaking too loud,<br> or tainting his discipline;<br> or from what<br> other course you please,<br> as the time will<br> more favourably minister.<br> Well.<br> Sir, he is rash<br> and very sudden in choler,<br> and haply with his truncheon<br> may strike at you:<br> Provoke him, that he may;<br> for even out of that<br> will I cause<br> these of Cyprus to mutiny;<br> whose qualification shall<br> come into no true taste again<br> but by the displanting<br> of Cassio.<br> So shall you<br> have a shorter journey<br> to your desires by the means<br> I shall then have to prefer them;<br> and the impediment<br> most profitably removed,<br> without the which there were<br> no expectation of our prosperity.<br> I will do this, if you can bring it<br> to any opportunity.<br> I warrant thee.<br> Meet me by and by<br> at the citadel:<br> I must fetch<br> his necessaries ashore.<br> Farewell.<br> Adieu.<br> That Cassio loves her,<br> I do well believe it;<br> That she loves him,<br> tis apt and of great credit:<br> The Moor, howbeit<br> I endure him not,<br> Is of a constant,<br> loving, noble nature,<br> And I dare think<br> hell prove to Desdemona<br> A most dear husband.<br> Now, I do love her too;<br> Not out of absolute lust,<br> though peradventure<br> I stand accountant<br> for as great a sin,<br> But partly led<br> to diet my revenge,<br> For that I do suspect<br> the lustful Moor<br> Hath leapd into my seat;<br> the thought whereof<br> Doth, like a poisonous mineral,<br> gnaw my inwards;<br> And nothing can or shall<br> content my soul<br> Till I am evend with him,<br> wife for wife,<br> Or failing so,<br> yet that I put the Moor<br> At least into<br> a jealousy so strong<br> That judgment cannot cure.<br> Which thing to do,<br> If this poor trash of Venice,<br> whom I trash<br> For his quick hunting,<br> stand the putting on,<br> Ill have our<br> Michael Cassio on the hip,<br> Abuse him to the Moor<br> in the rank garb...<br> For I fear Cassio<br> with my night-cap too...<br> Make the Moor thank me,<br> love me, reward me.<br> For making him<br> egregiously an ass<br> And practising upon<br> his peace and quiet<br> Even unto madness.<br> Tis here, but yet confused:<br> Knaverys plain face<br> is never seen til used.<br> Good Michael,<br> look you to the guard to-night:<br> Lets teach ourselves<br> that honourable stop,<br> Not to outsport discretion.<br> Iago hath direction<br> what to do;<br> But, notwithstanding,<br> with my personal eye<br> Will I look tot.<br> Iago is most honest.<br> Michael, good night:<br> To-morrow with your earliest<br> Let me have speech with you.<br> Come, my dear love,<br> The purchase made,<br> the fruits are to ensue;<br> That profits yet to come<br> twixt me and you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> To the watch.<br> Not this hour, lieutenant;<br> tis not yet ten o the clock.<br> Our general cast us thus early<br> for the love of his Desdemona;<br> who let us not therefore blame:<br> He hath not yet<br> made wanton the night with her;<br> and she is sport for Jove.<br> Shes a most exquisite lady.<br> And, Ill warrant her,<br> full of game.<br> Indeed, shes a most fresh<br> and delicate creature.<br> What an eye she has!<br> Methinks it sounds<br> a parley of provocation.<br> An inviting eye;<br> and yet methinks right modest.<br> And when she speaks,<br> is it not an alarum to love?<br> She is indeed perfection.<br> Well,<br> happiness to their sheets!<br> Come, lieutenant,<br> I have a stoup of wine;<br> and here without<br> are a brace of Cyprus gallants<br> who would fain have a measure<br> to the health of the black Othello.<br> Not to-night, good Iago:<br> I have very poor<br> and unhappy brains for drinking:<br> I could well wish<br> courtesy would invent<br> some other custom<br> of entertainment.<br> O, they are our friends;<br> but one cup: Ill drink for you.<br> I have drunk<br> but one cup to-night,<br> and that was craftily<br> qualified too, and, behold,<br> what innovation it makes here:<br> I am unfortunate<br> in the infirmity,<br> and dare not task my weakness<br> with any more.<br> What, man!<br> Tis a night of revels:<br> The gallants desire it.<br> Where are they?<br> Here at the door;<br> I pray you, call them in.<br> Ill dot;<br> but it dislikes me.<br> If I can fasten<br> but one cup upon him,<br> With that which<br> he hath drunk to-night already,<br> Hell be as full<br> of quarrel and offence<br> As my young mistress dog.<br> Now, my sick fool Roderigo,<br> Whom love hath turnd<br> almost the wrong side out,<br> To Desdemona<br> hath to-night caroused<br> Potations pottle-deep;<br> and hes to watch:<br> Three lads of Cyprus,<br> noble swelling spirits,<br> That hold their honour<br> in a wary distance,<br> The very elements<br> of this warlike isle,<br> Have I to-night<br> flusterd with flowing cups,<br> And they watch too.<br> Now, mongst<br> this flock of drunkards,<br> Am I to put our Cassio<br> in some action<br> Which may offend the isle...<br> But here they come:<br> If consequence<br> do but approve my dream,<br> My boat sails freely,<br> both with wind and stream.<br> Fore God, they have<br> given me a rouse already.<br> Good faith, a little one;<br> not past a pint,<br> as I am a soldier.<br> Some wine, ho!<br> And let me the canakin clink;<br> And let me the canakin clink<br> A soldiers a man;<br> A lifes but a span;<br> Why, then,<br> let a soldier drink.<br> Some wine, boys!<br> Fore God,<br> an excellent song.<br> I learned it in England,<br> where, indeed,<br> they are most<br> potent in potting:<br> Your Dane, your German,<br> your swag-bellied Hollander...<br> Drink...<br> are nothing to your English.<br> Is your Englishman<br> so expert in his drinking?<br> Hell drink you, with facility,<br> your Dane dead drunk;<br> he sweats not to overthrow<br> your Almain;<br> hell give<br> your Hollander a vomit,<br> ere the next<br> pottle can be filled.<br> To the health of our general!<br> I am for it, lieutenant;<br> and Ill do you justice.<br> O sweet England!<br> King Stephen was a worthy peer,<br> His breeches<br> cost him but a crown;<br> He held them sixpence<br> all too dear,<br> With that he calld<br> the tailor lown.<br> He was a wight of high renown,<br> And thou art but of low degree:<br> Tis pride<br> that pulls the country down;<br> Then take thine<br> auld cloak about thee.<br> Some wine!<br> A more exquisite song<br> than the other.<br> Will you heart again?<br> No; for I hold him<br> to be unworthy of his place<br> that does those things.<br> Well, Gods above all;<br> and there be souls<br> must be saved,<br> and there be souls<br> must not be saved.<br> Its true,<br> good lieutenant.<br> For mine own part...<br> no offence to the general,<br> nor any man of quality...<br> I am to be saved.<br> And so do I too,<br> lieutenant.<br> Ay, but, by your leave,<br> not before me;<br> the lieutenant is to be saved<br> before the ancient.<br> Lets have no more of this;<br> lets to our affairs...<br> God, forgive us our sins!...<br> Gentlemen,<br> lets look to our business.<br> Do not think, gentlemen,<br> that I am drunk:<br> This is my ancient;<br> this is my right hand,<br> and this is my left:<br> I am not drunk now;<br> I can stand well enough,<br> and I can speak well enough.<br> All Excellent well.<br> Very well then;<br> you must not think<br> that I am drunk.<br> You see this fellow<br> who is gone before;<br> He is a soldier<br> fit to stand by Caesar<br> And give direction:<br> And do but see his vice;<br> Tis to his virtue<br> a just equinox,<br> The one as long as the other:<br> Tis pity of him.<br> I fear the<br> trust Othello puts him in.<br> On some odd time<br> of his infirmity,<br> Will shake this island.<br> But is he often thus?<br> Tis evermore<br> the prologue to his sleep:<br> Hell watch<br> the horologe a double set,<br> If drink<br> rock not his cradle.<br> It were well<br> The general<br> were put in mind of it.<br> Perhaps he sees it not;<br> or his good nature<br> Prizes the virtue<br> that appears in Cassio,<br> And looks not on his evils:<br> Is not this true?<br> How now, Roderigo!<br> After the lieutenant; go.<br> And tis great pity<br> that the noble Moor<br> Should hazard such a place<br> as his own second<br> With one of<br> an ingraft infirmity:<br> It were an honest action<br> to say so to the Moor.<br> Not I, for all this island:<br> I do love Cassio well;<br> and would do much<br> To cure him of this evil...<br> What noise?<br> Whats the matter,<br> lieutenant?<br> A knave teach me my duty!<br> Ill beat the knave<br> into a twiggen bottle.<br> Beat me!<br> Dost thou prate, rogue?<br> Nay, good lieutenant;<br> I prithee, hold thy hand.<br> Away, I say; go out,<br> and cry a mutiny.<br> Come, youre drunk.<br> Gods will, gentlemen,<br> help.<br> Ho!...Lieutenant... sir...<br> Montano... sir;<br> Help, masters!...<br> Heres a goodly...<br> Lieutenant, sir, Gods will,<br> Youll be shamed forever.<br> Ho!<br> For your lives.<br> From whence ariseth this?<br> Are we turnd Turks,<br> and to ourselves do that<br> Which heaven<br> hath forbid the Ottomites?<br> For Christian shame,<br> put by this barbarous brawl:<br> He that stirs next<br> to carve for his own rage<br> Holds his soul light;<br> he dies upon his motion.<br> Silence that dreadful bell:<br> It frights the isle<br> From her propriety.<br> What is the matter,<br> masters?<br> Honest Iago,<br> that lookst dead with grieving,<br> Speak, who began this?<br> On thy love,<br> I charge thee.<br> I do not know:<br> Friends all but now, even now,<br> In quarter, and in terms<br> like bride and groom<br> Devesting them for bed;<br> and then, but now...<br> As if some planet<br> had unwitted men...<br> Swords out, and tilting<br> one at others breast,<br> In opposition bloody.<br> I cannot speak<br> Any beginning<br> to this peevish odds;<br> And would in action glorious<br> I had lost<br> These legs<br> that brought me to a part of it!<br> How comes it, Michael,<br> you are thus forgot?<br> I pray you, pardon me;<br> I cannot speak.<br> Worthy Montano,<br> you were wont to be civil;<br> The gravity and stillness<br> of your youth<br> The world hath noted,<br> and your name is great<br> In mouths of wisest censure:<br> Whats the matter,<br> That you unlace<br> your reputation thus<br> And spend your rich opinion<br> for the name<br> Of a night-brawler?<br> Give me answer to it.<br> Worthy Othello,<br> I am hurt to danger:<br> Your officer, Iago,<br> can inform you...<br> While I spare breath,<br> which something now offends me...<br> Of all that I do know:<br> Nor know I aught<br> By me thats said or done<br> amiss this night;<br> Unless self-charity<br> be sometimes a vice,<br> And to defend ourselves<br> it be a sin<br> When violence assails us.<br> Now, by heaven,<br> My blood begins<br> my safer guides to rule;<br> And passion,<br> having my best judgment collied,<br> Assays to lead the way:<br> Zounds, if I stir,<br> Or but lift this arm,<br> the best of you<br> Shall sink in my rebuke.<br> Give me to know<br> How this foul rout began,<br> who set it on;<br> And he that is approved<br> in this offence,<br> Though he had twinnd with me,<br> both at a birth,<br> Shall lose me.<br> What,<br> In a town of war,<br> Yet wild, the peoples<br> hearts brimful of fear,<br> To manage private<br> and domestic quarrel,<br> At night, and on<br> the court and guard of safety!<br> Tis monstrous.<br> Iago, who begant?<br> Partially affined,<br> or leagued in office,<br> Thou dost deliver<br> more or less than truth,<br> Thou art no soldier.<br> Touch me not so near:<br> I had rather have<br> this tongue cut from my mouth<br> Than it should do offence<br> to Michael Cassio;<br> Yet, I persuade myself,<br> to speak the truth<br> Shall nothing wrong him.<br> Thus it is, general.<br> Montano and myself<br> being in speech,<br> There comes a fellow<br> crying out for help:<br> And Cassio following him<br> with determined sword,<br> To execute upon him.<br> Sir, this gentleman<br> Steps in to Cassio,<br> to entreat his pause:<br> Myself the crying fellow<br> did pursue,<br> Lest by his clamour...<br> as it so fell out...<br> The town might fall in fright:<br> He, swift of foot,<br> Outran my purpose;<br> and I returnd the rather<br> For that I heard<br> the clink and fall of swords,<br> And Cassio high in oath;<br> which till to-night<br> I neer might say before.<br> When I came back...<br> For this was brief...<br> I found them close together,<br> At blow and thrust;<br> even as again they were<br> When you yourself<br> did part them.<br> More of this matter<br> can I not report:<br> But men are men;<br> the best sometimes forget:<br> Though Cassio did<br> some little wrong to him,<br> As men in rage strike those<br> that wish them best,<br> Yet surely Cassio,<br> I believe, received<br> From him that fled<br> some strange indignity<br> That patience could not pass.<br> I know, Iago,<br> Thy honesty and love<br> doth mince this matter,<br> Making it light to Cassio.<br> Cassio, I love thee<br> But never more<br> be officer of mine.<br> Look, if my gentle love<br> be not raised up!<br> Ill make thee<br> an example.<br> What is the matter, dear?<br> Alls well now, sweeting;<br> come away to bed.<br> Sir, for your hurts,<br> myself will be your surgeon:<br> Lead him off.<br> Iago, look with care<br> about the town,<br> And silence those<br> whom this vile brawl distracted.<br> Come, Desdemona:<br> Tis the soldiers life<br> To have their balmy<br> slumbers waked with strife.<br> What, are you hurt,<br> lieutenant?<br> Ay,<br> past all surgery.<br> Marry, God forbid!<br> Reputation, reputation,<br> Ive lost my reputation!<br> I have lost<br> the immortal part of me,<br> and what remains is bestial.<br> My reputation, Iago,<br> my reputation!<br> As I am an honest man,<br> I thought you had received<br> some bodily wound;<br> there is more sense in that<br> than in reputation.<br> Reputations an idle<br> and most false imposition:<br> Oft gained without merit,<br> and lost without deserving:<br> You have lost<br> no reputation at all,<br> unless you repute yourself<br> such a loser.<br> What, man!<br> There are ways to recover<br> the general again:<br> You are but now<br> cast in his mood,<br> a punishment more in policy than in malice,<br> as one would beat<br> ones offenceless dog<br> to affright an imperious lion:<br> Sue to him again,<br> and hes yours.<br> I will rather sue<br> to be despised<br> than to deceive so good<br> a commander with so slight,<br> so drunken,<br> and so indiscreet an officer.<br> Drunk?<br> And speak parrot?<br> And squabble?<br> Swagger?<br> Swear?<br> And discourse fustian<br> with ones own shadow?<br> O thou<br> invisible spirit of wine,<br> if thou hast<br> no name to be known by,<br> let us call thee devil!<br> What was he that you<br> followed with your sword?<br> What had he done to you?<br> I know not.<br> Ist possible?<br> I remember a mass of things,<br> but nothing distinctly;<br> a quarrel,<br> but nothing wherefore.<br> O God, that men should<br> put an enemy in their mouths<br> to steal away their brains!<br> That we should, with joy,<br> pleasance revel and applause,<br> transform ourselves<br> into beasts!<br> Why, you are<br> but now well enough:<br> How came you thus recovered?<br> It hath pleased<br> the devil drunkenness<br> to give place<br> to the devil wrath;<br> one unperfectness<br> shows me another,<br> to make me<br> frankly despise myself.<br> Come, you are<br> too severe a moraler:<br> As the time, the place,<br> and the condition<br> of this country stands,<br> I could heartily wish<br> this had not befallen;<br> but, since it is as it is,<br> mend it for your own good.<br> I will ask him<br> for my place again;<br> he shall tell me<br> I am a drunkard.<br> Had I<br> as many mouths as Hydra,<br> such an answer<br> would stop them all.<br> To be now a sensible man,<br> by and by a fool,<br> and presently a beast!<br> O strange!<br> Every inordinate cup<br> is unblessed<br> and the ingredient<br> is a devil.<br> Come, come, good wine<br> is a good familiar creature,<br> if it be well used:<br> Exclaim no more against it.<br> And, good lieutenant,<br> I think you think I love you.<br> I have well approved it, sir.<br> I drunk!<br> You or any man living<br> may be drunk<br> at some time, man.<br> I shall tell you<br> what you shall do.<br> Our generals wife<br> is now the general:<br> I may say so in this respect,<br> that he hath devoted<br> and given up himself<br> to the contemplation,<br> mark, and denotement<br> of her parts and graces:<br> Confess yourself freely to her;<br> importune her help<br> to put you in your place again:<br> She is of so free, so kind,<br> so apt,<br> so blessed a disposition,<br> she holds it a vice<br> in her goodness<br> not to do more<br> than she is requested:<br> This broken joint<br> between you and her husband<br> entreat her to splinter;<br> and, my fortune<br> against any lay worth naming,<br> this crack of your love shallgrow stronger<br> than it was before.<br> You advise me well.<br> I protest, in the sincerity<br> of love and honest kindness.<br> I think it freely;<br> and betimes in the morning<br> I will beseech<br> the virtuous Desdemona<br> to undertake for me:<br> I am desperate of my fortunes<br> if they cheque me here.<br> You are in the right,<br> lieutenant.<br> Good night;<br> I must to the watch.<br> Good night, honest Iago.<br> And whats he then<br> that says I play the villain?<br> When this advice<br> is free I give, honest,<br> Probal to thinking<br> and indeed the course<br> To win the Moor again?<br> For tis most easy<br> The inclining Desdemona<br> to subdue<br> In any honest suit:<br> Shes framed as fruitful<br> As the free elements.<br> And then for her<br> To win the Moor...<br> weret to renounce his baptism,<br> All seals and symbols<br> of redeemed sin,<br> His soul is<br> so enfetterd to her love,<br> That she may make, unmake,<br> do what she list,<br> Even as her appetite<br> shall play the god<br> With his weak function.<br> How am I then a villain<br> To counsel Cassio<br> to this parallel course,<br> Directly to his good?<br> Divinity of hell!<br> When devils<br> will the blackest sins put on,<br> They do suggest at first<br> with heavenly shows,<br> As I do now:<br> For whilst this honest fool<br> Plies Desdemona<br> to repair his fortunes<br> And she for him<br> pleads strongly with the Moor,<br> Ill pour this pestilence<br> into his ear,<br> That she repeals him<br> for her bodys lust;<br> By how much<br> she strives to do him good,<br> Shell undo her credit<br> with the Moor.<br> So shall<br> I turn her virtue into pitch,<br> And out of her own goodness make the net<br> That shall enmesh them all.<br> How now, Roderigo!<br> I do follow here in the chase,<br> not like a hound that hunts,<br> but one that fills up the cry.<br> My money is almost spent;<br> I have been to-night<br> exceedingly well cudgelled;<br> and I think the issue will be,<br> I shall have so much experience<br> for my pains as that comes to,<br> and so, with no money at all<br> and a little more wit,<br> return again to Venice.<br> How poor are they<br> that have not patience!<br> What wound did ever heal<br> but by degrees?<br> Thou knowst we work by wit,<br> and not by witchcraft;<br> And wit depends<br> on dilatory time.<br> Doest not go well?<br> Cassio hath beaten thee.<br> And thou, by that small hurt,<br> hast cashierd Cassio:<br> Though other things grow fair<br> against the sun,<br> Yet fruits that blossom first<br> shall first be ripe:<br> Content thyself awhile.<br> By the mass, tis morning;<br> Pleasure and action<br> make the hours seem short.<br> Retire thee;<br> go where thou art billeted:<br> Away, I say;<br> thou shalt know more hereafter:<br> Nay, get thee gone.<br> Two things are to be done:<br> My wife must move<br> for Cassio to her mistress;<br> Ill set her on;<br> Myself the while<br> to draw the Moor apart,<br> And bring him jump<br> when he may Cassio find<br> Soliciting his wife:<br> Ay, thats the way<br> Dull not device<br> with coldness and delay.<br> Good morrow,<br> good Lieutenant:<br> I am sorry<br> for your displeasure;<br> but all will sure be well.<br> The general and his wife<br> are talking of it;<br> And she speaks for you stoutly:<br> The Moor replies,<br> That he you hurt<br> is of great fame in Cyprus,<br> And great affinity,<br> and that in wholesome wisdom<br> He might not but refuse you;<br> but he protests he loves you<br> And needs no other suitor<br> but his likings<br> To take the safest occasion<br> by the front<br> To bring you in again.<br> Yet, I beseech you,<br> Give me advantage<br> of some brief discourse<br> With Desdemona alone.<br> Be thou assured, good Cassio,<br> I will do<br> All my abilities<br> in thy behalf.<br> Good madam, do:<br> I warrant it grieves my husband,<br> As if the case were his.<br> O, thats an honest fellow.<br> Do not doubt, Cassio,<br> But I will have<br> my lord and you again<br> As friendly as you were.<br> Bounteous madam,<br> Whatever shall<br> become of Michael Cassio,<br> Hes never any thing<br> but your true servant.<br> I knowt; I thank you.<br> You do love my lord:<br> You have known him long;<br> and be you well assured<br> You shall in strangeness stand no<br> further off than in a polite distance.<br> Ay, but, lady,<br> That policy may<br> either last so long,<br> Or feed upon<br> such nice and waterish diet,<br> Or breed itself<br> so out of circumstance,<br> That, I being absent<br> and my place supplied,<br> My general will forget<br> my love and service.<br> Do not doubt that;<br> before Emilia here<br> I give thee warrant<br> of thy place: Assure thee,<br> If I do vow a friendship,<br> Ill perform it<br> To the last article:<br> My lord shall never rest;<br> Ill watch him tame<br> and talk him out of patience;<br> His bed shall seem a school,<br> his board a shrift;<br> Ill intermingle<br> every thing he does<br> With Cassios suit:<br> Therefore be merry, Cassio;<br> For thy solicitor<br> shall rather die<br> Than give thy cause away.<br> Madam,<br> here comes my lord.<br> Madam,<br> Ill take my leave.<br> Nay, stay,<br> and hear me speak.<br> Madam, not now:<br> I am very ill at ease,<br> Unfit for mine own purposes.<br> Well,<br> do your discretion.<br> I like not that.<br> What dost thou say?<br> Nothing, my lord:<br> Or if... I know not what.<br> Was not that Cassio<br> parted from my wife?<br> Cassio, my lord!<br> No, sure, I cannot think it,<br> That he would sneak away<br> so guilty-like,<br> Seeing you coming.<br> I do believe twas he.<br> How now, my lord!<br> I have been talking<br> with a suitor here,<br> A man who languishes<br> in your displeasure.<br> Who ist you mean?<br> Why, your lieutenant,<br> Cassio.<br> Good my lord,<br> If I have any grace or power<br> to move you,<br> His present<br> reconciliation take;<br> For if he be not one<br> that truly loves you,<br> That errs in ignorance<br> and not in cunning,<br> I have no judgment<br> of an honest face:<br> I prithee, call him back.<br> Went he hence now?<br> Yes, faith; so humbled<br> That he hath left<br> part of his grief with me,<br> To suffer with him.<br> Good love, call him back.<br> Not now, sweet Desdemona;<br> some other time.<br> But shallt be shortly?<br> The sooner, sweet,<br> for you.<br> Shallt be<br> to-night at supper?<br> No,<br> not to-night.<br> To-morrow dinner,<br> then?<br> No, I shall not dine at home;<br> I meet the captains<br> at the citadel.<br> Why, then, to-morrow night;<br> or Tuesday morn;<br> On Tuesday noon, or night;<br> or Wednesday morn:<br> I prithee, name the time,<br> but let it not<br> Exceed three days:<br> In faith, hes penitent;<br> And yet his trespass,<br> in our common reason...<br> Save that, they say,<br> the wars must make example<br> Out of their best...<br> is not almost a fault<br> To incur a private cheque.<br> Shh.<br> When shall he come?<br> Tell me, Othello:<br> I wonder in my soul,<br> What you would ask me,<br> that I should deny,<br> Or stand so mammering on.<br> What!<br> Michael Cassio,<br> That came a-wooing with you,<br> and so many a time,<br> When I have spoke of you<br> dispraisingly,<br> Hath taen your part;<br> to have so much to do to bring him in!<br> If I a lady,<br> I could do much...<br> Prithee, no more:<br> Let him come when he will;<br> I will deny thee nothing.<br> Why, this is not a boon;<br> Tis as I should entreat you<br> wear your gloves,<br> Or feed off nourishing dishes,<br> or keep you warm,<br> Or sue to you<br> to do a peculiar profit<br> To your own person:<br> Nay, when I have a suit<br> Wherein I mean<br> to touch your love indeed,<br> It will be full of poise<br> and difficult weight<br> And fearful to be granted.<br> I will deny thee nothing:<br> Whereon, I do beseech thee,<br> grant me this,<br> To leave me<br> but a little to myself.<br> Shall I deny you?<br> No: Farewell,<br> my lord.<br> Farewell, Desdemona:<br> Ill come to thee straight.<br> Emilia, come.<br> Be as<br> your fancies teach you;<br> Whateer you be,<br> I am obedient.<br> Excellent wretch!<br> Perdition catch my soul,<br> But I do love thee!<br> And when I love thee not,<br> Chaos is come again.<br> My noble lord...<br> What dost thou say, Iago?<br> Did Michael Cassio,<br> when you wood my lady,<br> Know of your love?<br> He did, from first to last:<br> Why dost thou ask?<br> But for<br> a satisfaction of my thought;<br> No further harm.<br> Why of thy thought,<br> Iago?<br> I did not think<br> he had been acquainted with her.<br> O, yes;<br> and went between us very often.<br> Indeed.<br> Indeed.<br> Ay, indeed:<br> Discernst thou aught in that?<br> Is he not honest?<br> Honest, my lord?<br> Honest!<br> Ay, honest.<br> My lord,<br> for aught I know.<br> What dost thou think?<br> Think, my lord?<br> Think, my lord.<br> By heaven, he echoes me,<br> As if there were<br> some monster in his thought<br> Too hideous to be shown.<br> Thou dost mean something:<br> I heard thee say even now,<br> thou likedst not that,<br> When Cassio left my wife:<br> What didst not like?<br> And when I told thee<br> he was of my counsel<br> In my whole course of wooing,<br> thou criedst Indeed!<br> And didst contract<br> and purse thy brow together,<br> As if thou then<br> hadst shut up in thy brain<br> Some horrible conceit:<br> If thou dost love me,<br> Show me thy thought.<br> My lord,<br> you know I love you.<br> I think thou dost;<br> And, for I know thourt<br> full of love and honesty,<br> And weighst thy words<br> before thou givest them breath,<br> Therefore these stops of thine<br> fright me the more:<br> For such things<br> in a false disloyal knave<br> Are tricks of custom,<br> but in a man thats just<br> They are close delations,<br> working from the heart<br> That passion cannot rule.<br> For Michael Cassio,<br> I dare presume<br> I think he is honest.<br> I think so too.<br> Men should be what they seem;<br> Or those that be not,<br> would they might seem none!<br> Certain, men<br> should be what they seem.<br> Why, then,<br> I think Cassios an honest man.<br> Nay, yet<br> theres more in this:<br> I prithee, speak to me<br> as to thy thinkings,<br> As thou dost ruminate,<br> and give thy worst of thoughts<br> The worst of words.<br> Good my lord, pardon me:<br> Though I am bound<br> to every act of duty,<br> I am not bound to that<br> all slaves are free to.<br> Utter my thoughts?<br> Why, say<br> they are vile and false;<br> As wheres that<br> palace whereinto foul things<br> Sometimes intrude not?<br> Who has that breast so pure,<br> But some<br> uncleanly apprehensions<br> Keep leets and law-days<br> and in session sit<br> With meditations lawful?<br> Thou dost conspire<br> against thy friend, Iago,<br> If thou but thinkst<br> him wrongd and makest his ear<br> A stranger to thy thoughts.<br> I do beseech you...<br> Though I perchance<br> am vicious in my guess,<br> As, I confess,<br> it is my natures plague<br> To spy into abuses,<br> and oft my jealousy<br> Shapes faults<br> which are not...<br> that your wisdom yet,<br> From one that<br> so imperfectly conjects,<br> Would take no notice,<br> nor build yourself a trouble<br> Out of his scattering<br> and unsure observance.<br> It were not<br> for your quiet nor your good,<br> Nor for my manhood,<br> honesty, or wisdom,<br> To let you know my thoughts.<br> What dost thou mean?<br> Good name in man and woman,<br> dear my lord,<br> Is the immediate jewel<br> of their souls:<br> Who steals my purse steals trash;<br> tis something, nothing;<br> Twas mine, tis his,<br> and has been slave to thousands:<br> But he that filches from me<br> my good name<br> Robs me of that<br> which not enriches him<br> And makes me poor indeed.<br> By heaven,<br> Ill know thy thoughts.<br> You cannot,<br> if my heart were in your hand;<br> Nor shall not,<br> whilst tis in my custody.<br> Ha.<br> O, beware, my lord,<br> of jealousy;<br> It is the green-eyed monster<br> that doth mock<br> The meat it feeds on;<br> that cuckold lives in bliss<br> Who, certain of his fate,<br> loves not his wronger;<br> But, O, what damned minutes<br> tells he oer<br> Who dotes, yet doubts,<br> suspects, yet strongly loves!<br> O misery!<br> Poor and content<br> is rich and rich enough,<br> But riches fineless<br> is as poor as winter<br> To him that<br> ever fears he shall be poor.<br> Good God, the souls<br> of all my tribe defend from jealousy!<br> Why, why is this?<br> Thinkst thou Ild<br> make a life of jealousy,<br> To follow still<br> the changes of the moon<br> With fresh suspicions?<br> No; to be once in doubt<br> Is once to be resolved:<br> Exchange me for a goat,<br> When I shall turn<br> the business of my soul<br> To such exsufflicate<br> and blown surmises,<br> Matching thy inference.<br> Tis not to make me jealous<br> To say my wife is fair,<br> feeds well, loves company,<br> Is free of speech,<br> sings, plays and dances well;<br> Where virtue is,<br> these are more virtuous:<br> Nor from mine<br> own weak merits will I draw<br> The smallest<br> fear or doubt of her revolt;<br> For she had eyes,<br> and chose me.<br> No, Iago; Ill see before<br> I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br> And on the proof,<br> there is no more but this...<br> Away at once<br> with love or jealousy!<br> I am glad of this;<br> for now I shall have reason<br> To show<br> the love and duty I bear you<br> With franker spirit:<br> Therefore, as I am bound,<br> Receive it from me.<br> I speak not yet of proof.<br> Look to your wife;<br> observe her well with Cassio;<br> Wear your eye thus,<br> not jealous nor secure:<br> I would not have<br> your free and noble nature,<br> Out of self-bounty, be abused;<br> look tot:<br> For I do know<br> our country disposition well;<br> In Venice they do<br> let God see the pranks<br> They dare not show their husbands;<br> their best conscience<br> Is not to leavet undone,<br> but keept unknown.<br> Dost thou say so?<br> She deceived her father,<br> marrying you;<br> And when she seemd<br> to shake and fear your looks,<br> She loved them most.<br> And so she did.<br> Why, go to then;<br> She that, so young,<br> could give out such a seeming,<br> As to seal her fathers<br> eyes up close as oak...<br> He thought twas witchcraft...<br> but I am much to blame;<br> I humbly do beseech you<br> of your pardon<br> For too much loving you.<br> I am bound to thee for ever.<br> I see this hath<br> a little dashd your spirits.<br> No, not a jot,<br> not a jot.<br> I fear it has.<br> I hope you will consider<br> what is spoke<br> Comes from my love.<br> But I do see you are moved:<br> I pray you<br> not to strain my speech<br> To grosser issues<br> nor to further reach<br> Than to suspicion.<br> I will not.<br> Should you do so, my lord,<br> My speech should<br> fall into such vile success<br> As my thoughts<br> aim not.<br> Cassios my worthy friend...<br> My lord,<br> I see youre moved.<br> No, not much moved:<br> I do not think<br> but Desdemonas honest.<br> Long live she so!<br> And long live you to think so!<br> And yet,<br> how nature erring from itself...<br> Ay, theres the point:<br> As... to be bold with you...<br> Not to affect<br> many proposed matches<br> Of her own clime, complexion,<br> and degree,<br> Whereto we see<br> in all things nature tends...<br> Foh!<br> One may smell<br> in such a will most rank,<br> Foul disproportion<br> thoughts unnatural.<br> But pardon me;<br> I do not in position<br> Distinctly speak of her;<br> though I may fear<br> Her will, recoiling<br> to her better judgment,<br> May fall to match you<br> with her country forms<br> And happily repent.<br> Farewell, farewell:<br> If more thou dost perceive,<br> let me know more;<br> Set on thy wife to observe:<br> Leave me, Iago.<br> My lord,<br> I take my leave.<br> Why did I marry?<br> This honest creature doubtless<br> Sees and knows more, much more,<br> than he unfolds.<br> I would I might entreat you<br> To scan this thing no further;<br> leave it to time:<br> Though it is fit<br> that Cassio have his place,<br> For sure, he fills it up<br> with great ability,<br> Yet, if you please<br> to hold him off awhile,<br> You may by that perceive him<br> and his means:<br> Note, if your lady<br> strain his entertainment<br> With any strong<br> or vehement suit;<br> Much will be<br> seen in that.<br> In the mean time,<br> Let me be thought<br> too busy in my fears...<br> As worthy cause<br> I have to fear I am...<br> And hold her free,<br> I do beseech your honour.<br> Fear not my government.<br> I once more take my leave.<br> This fellows<br> of exceeding honesty,<br> And knows all qualities,<br> with a learned spirit,<br> Of human dealings.<br> If I do prove her haggard,<br> Though that her jesses<br> were my dear heartstrings,<br> Id whistle her off<br> and let her down the wind,<br> To pray at fortune.<br> Haply, for I am black<br> And have not<br> those soft parts of conversation<br> That chamberers have,<br> or for I am declined<br> Into the vale of years...<br> yet thats not much...<br> Shes gone.<br> I am abused;<br> and my relief<br> Must be to loathe her.<br> O curse of marriage,<br> That we can call<br> these delicate creatures ours,<br> And not their appetites!<br> I had rather be a toad,<br> And live upon<br> the vapour of a dungeon,<br> Than keep a corner<br> in the thing I love<br> For others uses.<br> Yet, tis the plague<br> of great ones;<br> Prerogatived<br> are they less than the base;<br> Tis destiny unshunnable,<br> like death:<br> Even then this<br> forked plague is fated to us<br> When we do quicken.<br> Here she comes: And<br> If she be false,<br> O, then heaven mocks itself!<br> Ill not believet.<br> How now, my dear Othello!<br> Your dinner,<br> and the generous islanders<br> By you invited,<br> do attend your presence.<br> I am to blame.<br> Why do you speak so faintly?<br> Are you not well?<br> I have a pain<br> upon my forehead here.<br> Faith, thats with watching;<br> twill away again:<br> Let me but bind it hard,<br> within this hour<br> It will be well.<br> Your napkin<br> is too small:<br> Let it alone.<br> Come,<br> Ill go in with you.<br> I am very sorry<br> that you are not well.<br> I am glad<br> I have found this napkin:<br> This was her first remembrance<br> from the Moor:<br> My wayward husband<br> hath a hundred times<br> Wood me to steal it;<br> but she so loves the token,<br> For he conjured her<br> she should ever keep it,<br> That she reserves<br> it evermore about her<br> To kiss<br> and talk to.<br> Ill have the work taen out,<br> And givet Iago:<br> What he will do with it<br> Heaven knows,<br> not I;<br> I nothing<br> but to please his fantasy.<br> How now!<br> What do you here alone?<br> Do not you chide;<br> I have a thing for you.<br> You have a thing for me?<br> It is a common thing...<br> Ha?<br> To have a foolish wife.<br> O, is that all?<br> What will you give me now<br> for that same handkerchief?<br> What handkerchief?<br> What handkerchief?<br> Why, that the Moor<br> first gave to Desdemona;<br> That which<br> so often you did bid me steal.<br> Hast stoln it<br> from her?<br> No, faith;<br> she let it drop by negligence.<br> And, to the advantage,<br> I, being here, tookt up.<br> Look, here it is.<br> A good wench;<br> give it me.<br> Ah, ah, ah.<br> What will you do with t,<br> that you have been so earnest<br> To have me filch it?<br> Why, whats that to you?<br> If it be not<br> for some purpose of import,<br> Givet me again:<br> Poor lady, shell run mad<br> When she shall lack it.<br> Be not acknown on t;<br> I have use for it.<br> Leave me.<br> In Cassios lodging,<br> Ill lose this napkin,<br> And let him find it.<br> Trifles light as air<br> Are to the<br> jealous confirmations strong<br> As proofs of holy writ:<br> This may do something.<br> The Moor already<br> changes with my poison:<br> Dangerous conceits are,<br> in their natures, poisons<br> that at first<br> are scarce found to distaste,<br> But with a little act<br> upon the blood.<br> Burn like<br> the mines of Sulphur.<br> I did say so:<br> Look, where he comes!<br> Not poppy, nor mandragora,<br> Nor all the<br> drowsy syrups of the world,<br> Shall ever medicine thee<br> to that sweet sleep<br> Which<br> thou owedst yesterday.<br> Ha!<br> False to me,<br> to me?<br> Why, how now, my lord.<br> No more of that.<br> Avaunt!<br> Be gone!<br> Thou hast set me on the rack:<br> I swear tis better<br> to be much abused<br> Than but to knowt a little.<br> How now, my lord!<br> What sense had I<br> of her stoln hours of lust?<br> I sawt not, thought it not,<br> it harmd not me:<br> I slept the next night well,<br> fed well, was free and merry;<br> I found not Cassios kisses<br> on her lips:<br> He that is robbd,<br> not wanting what is stoln,<br> Let him not knowt,<br> and hes not robbd at all.<br> I am sorry to hear this.<br> I had been happy,<br> if the general camp,<br> Pioneers and all,<br> had tasted her sweet body,<br> So I had nothing known.<br> O, now, for ever<br> Farewell the tranquil mind!<br> Farewell content!<br> Farewell the plumed troop,<br> and the big wars,<br> That makes ambition virtue!<br> O, farewell!<br> Farewell the neighing steed,<br> and the shrill trump,<br> The spirit-stirring drum,<br> the ear-piercing fife,<br> The royal banner,<br> and all quality,<br> Pride, pomp and<br> circumstance of glorious war!<br> And, O you mortal engines,<br> whose rude throats<br> The immortal Joves<br> dead clamours counterfeit,<br> Farewell!<br> Othellos occupations gone!<br> Ist possible, my lord?<br> Villain, be sure<br> thou prove my love a whore,<br> Be sure of it;<br> Or by the worth<br> of mans eternal soul,<br> Thou hadst been better<br> have been born a dog<br> Than answer my waked wrath!<br> Ist come to this?<br> Make me to seet; or,<br> at the least, so prove it,<br> That the probation<br> bear no hinge nor loop<br> To hang a doubt on;<br> or woe upon thy life!<br> My noble lord...<br> If thou dost slander her<br> and torture me,<br> Never pray more;<br> abandon all remorse;<br> On horrors<br> head horrors accumulate;<br> Do deeds to make heaven weep,<br> all earth amazed;<br> For nothing canst thou<br> to damnation add<br> Greater than that.<br> O grace!<br> O heaven forgive me!<br> Are you a man?<br> Have you a soul or sense?<br> God be wi you;<br> take mine office.<br> O wretched fool.<br> That livest to make<br> thine honesty a vice!<br> O monstrous world!<br> Take note, take note,<br> O world,<br> To be direct<br> and honest is not safe.<br> I thank you for this profit;<br> and from hence<br> Ill love no friend,<br> sith love breeds such offence.<br> Nay, stay:<br> Thou shouldst be honest.<br> I should be wise,<br> for honestys a fool<br> And loses that it works for.<br> By the world, I think my wife<br> be honest and think she is not;<br> I think that thou art just<br> and think thou art not.<br> Ill have some proof.<br> Her name, that was as fresh<br> As Dians visage,<br> is now begrimed and black<br> As mine own face.<br> If there be cords,<br> or knives,<br> Poison, or fire,<br> or suffocating streams,<br> Ill not endure it.<br> Would I were satisfied!<br> I see, sir,<br> you are eaten up with passion:<br> I regret me<br> that I ever put it to you.<br> You would be satisfied?<br> Nay, and I will.<br> And may: But, how?<br> How satisfied?<br> Would you, the supervisor,<br> grossly gape on...<br> Behold her toppd?<br> Death and damnation!<br> It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br> To bring them to that prospect:<br> Damn them then,<br> If ever mortal eyes<br> do see them bolster<br> More than their own!<br> What then?<br> How then?<br> What shall I say?<br> Wheres satisfaction?<br> It is impossible<br> you should see this,<br> Were they as prime as goats,<br> as hot as monkeys,<br> As salt as wolves in pride,<br> and fools as gross<br> as ignorance made drunk.<br> But yet, I say,<br> If imputation<br> and strong circumstances,<br> Which lead directly<br> to the door of truth,<br> Will give you satisfaction,<br> you might havet.<br> You give me a living reason<br> shes disloyal.<br> I do not like the office:<br> But, sith I am enterd<br> in this cause so far,<br> Prickd tot<br> by foolish honesty and love,<br> I will go on.<br> I lay with Cassio lately;<br> And, being troubled<br> with a raging tooth,<br> I could not sleep.<br> There are a kind of men<br> so loose of souls,<br> That in their sleeps<br> will mutter their affairs:<br> One of this kind is Cassio:<br> In sleep I heard him say<br> Sweet Desdemona,<br> Let us be wary,<br> let us hide our loves;<br> And then, sir, would he gripe<br> and wring my hand,<br> Cried O sweet creature!<br> And then kiss me hard,<br> As if he pluckd up kisses<br> by the roots<br> That grew upon my lips:<br> Then laid his leg<br> Over my thigh, and sighd,<br> and kissd; and then<br> Cried Cursed fate<br> that gave thee to the Moor!<br> O monstrous!<br> Monstrous!<br> Nay,<br> this was but his dream.<br> But this denoted<br> a foregone conclusion:<br> Tis a shrewd doubt,<br> though it be but a dream.<br> And this may help<br> to thicken other proofs<br> That do demonstrate thinly.<br> Ill tear her all to pieces.<br> Nay, but be wise:<br> Yet we see nothing done;<br> She may be honest yet.<br> Tell me but this,<br> Have you not sometimes<br> seen a handkerchief<br> Spotted with strawberries<br> in your wifes hand?<br> I gave her such a one;<br> twas my first gift.<br> I know not that;<br> yet such a handkerchief...<br> I am sure it was<br> your wifes... did I to-day<br> See Cassio wipe his beard with.<br> If it be that...<br> If it be that,<br> or any that was hers,<br> It speaks against her<br> with the other proofs.<br> O, that the slave<br> had forty thousand lives!<br> One is too poor,<br> too weak for my revenge.<br> Now, look here, Iago;<br> All my fond love<br> thus do I blow to heaven.<br> Tis gone.<br> Arise, black vengeance,<br> from the hollow hell!<br> Yield up, O love,<br> thy crown and hearted throne<br> To tyrannous hate!<br> Swell, bosom,<br> with thy fraught,<br> For tis<br> of aspics tongues!<br> Yet be content.<br> Blood,<br> blood, blood!<br> Patience,<br> your mind perhaps may change.<br> Never, Iago:<br> Like to the Pontic sea,<br> Whose icy current<br> and compulsive course<br> Neer feels retiring ebb,<br> but keeps due on<br> To the Propontic<br> and the Hellespont,<br> Even so my bloody thoughts,<br> with violent pace,<br> Shall neer look back,<br> neer ebb to humble love,<br> Till that<br> a capable and wide revenge<br> Swallow them up.<br> Now,<br> by yond marble heaven,<br> In the due reverence<br> of a sacred vow<br> I here engage my words.<br> Do not rise yet.<br> Witness, you<br> ever-burning lights above,<br> You elements<br> that clip us round about,<br> Witness that<br> here Iago doth give up<br> The execution of his wit,<br> hands, heart,<br> To wrongd<br> Othellos service!<br> Let him command,<br> And to obey shall<br> be in me remorse,<br> What bloody business ever.<br> I greet thy love,<br> Not with vain thanks,<br> but with acceptance bounteous,<br> And will<br> upon the instant put thee tot:<br> Within these three days<br> let me hear thee say<br> That Cassios not alive.<br> My friend is dead;<br> tis done at your request:<br> But let her live.<br> Damn her,<br> lewd minx!<br> Damn her!<br> Damn her.<br> Come, go with me apart;<br> I will withdraw,<br> To furnish me<br> with some quick means of death<br> For the fair devil.<br> Now art thou my lieutenant.<br> I am your own for ever.<br> Where should I lose<br> that handkerchief, Emilia?<br> I know not, madam.<br> Believe me,<br> Id rather have lose my purse<br> Full of crusadoes:<br> And, but my noble Moor<br> Is true of mind and made<br> of no such baseness<br> As jealous creatures are,<br> it were enough<br> To put him to ill thinking.<br> Is he not jealous?<br> Who, he?<br> I think the sun<br> where he was born<br> Drew all such<br> humours from him.<br> Look, where he comes.<br> I will not<br> leave him now till Cassio<br> Be calld to him.<br> How ist with you,<br> my lord?<br> Well,<br> my good lady.<br> O, hardness<br> to dissemble...<br> How do you, Desdemona?<br> Well, my good lord.<br> Give me thy hand:<br> This hand is moist,<br> my lady.<br> It yet hath felt no age<br> nor known no sorrow.<br> This argues fruitfulness<br> and liberal heart:<br> Hot, hot, and moist:<br> This hand of yours requires<br> A sequester from liberty,<br> fasting and prayer,<br> Much castigation,<br> exercise devout;<br> For heres a young<br> and sweating devil here,<br> That commonly rebels.<br> Tis a good hand,<br> A frank one.<br> You may, indeed, say so;<br> For twas that hand<br> that gave away my heart.<br> A liberal hand:<br> The hearts of old gave hands;<br> But our new heraldry is hands,<br> not hearts.<br> I cannot speak of this.<br> Come now,<br> your promise.<br> What promise, chuck?<br> I have sent to bid Cassio<br> come speak with you.<br> I have a salt<br> and sorry rheum offends me;<br> Lend me thy handkerchief.<br> Here, my lord.<br> That which I gave you.<br> I have it not about me.<br> Not?<br> No, my lord.<br> Thats a fault.<br> That handkerchief<br> Did an Egyptian<br> to my mother give;<br> She was a charmer,<br> and could almost read<br> The thoughts of people:<br> She told her,<br> while she kept it,<br> Twould make her amiable<br> and subdue my father<br> Entirely to her love,<br> but if she lost it<br> Or made a gift of it,<br> my fathers eye<br> Should hold her loathly<br> and his spirits should hunt<br> After new fancies:<br> She, dying, gave it me;<br> And bid me,<br> when my fate would have me wive,<br> I give it her.<br> I did so:<br> And take heed ont;<br> Make it a darling<br> like your precious eye;<br> To loset or givet away<br> were such perdition<br> As nothing else could match.<br> Ist possible?<br> Tis true:<br> Theres magic in the web of it:<br> A sibyl,<br> that had numberd in the world<br> The sun to course<br> two hundred compasses,<br> In her prophetic fury<br> sewd the work;<br> The worms were hallowd<br> that did breed the silk;<br> And it was dyed in mummy<br> which the skilful<br> Conserved<br> of maidens hearts.<br> Ist true?<br> Most veritable;<br> therefore look tot well.<br> Then would to God<br> that I had never seent!<br> Ha!<br> Wherefore?<br> Why do you speak<br> so startingly and rash?<br> Ist lost?<br> Ist gone?<br> Speak,<br> is it out o the way?<br> Heaven bless us!<br> Say you?<br> It is not lost;<br> but what an if it were?<br> How!<br> I say, it is not lost.<br> Fetcht, let me seet.<br> Why, so I can, sir,<br> but I will not now.<br> This is a trick<br> to put me from my suit:<br> I pray you,<br> let Cassio be received again.<br> Fetch me the handkerchief:<br> My mind misgives.<br> Come, come;<br> Youll never meet<br> a more sufficient man.<br> The handkerchief!<br> I pray,<br> talk me of Cassio.<br> The handkerchief!<br> A man that all his time<br> Hath founded the good fortunes<br> on your love,<br> Shared dangers with you...<br> The handkerchief!<br> In faith,<br> you are to blame.<br> Zounds!<br> Is not this man jealous?<br> I neer saw this before.<br> Sure, theres some wonder<br> in this handkerchief:<br> I am most unhappy<br> at the loss of it.<br> Tis not a year or two<br> shows us a man:<br> They are all but stomachs,<br> and we all but food;<br> They eat us hungerly,<br> and when they are full,<br> They belch us.<br> Look you,<br> Cassio and my husband,<br> There is no other way;<br> tis she must dot:<br> And, lo, the happiness!<br> Go, and importune her.<br> How now,<br> good Cassio!<br> Whats the news with you?<br> Madam, my former suit:<br> I do beseech you<br> That by your virtuous means<br> I may again<br> Exist, and be<br> a member of his love<br> Whom I with<br> all the office of my heart<br> Entirely honour:<br> I would not be delayd.<br> If my offence<br> be of such mortal kind<br> That nor my service past,<br> nor present sorrows,<br> Nor purposed<br> merit in futurity,<br> Can ransom me<br> into his love again,<br> But to know so<br> must be my benefit;<br> So shall I clothe me<br> in a forced content,<br> And shut myself up<br> in some other course,<br> To fortunes alms.<br> Alas,<br> thrice-gentle Cassio!<br> My advocation<br> is not now in tune;<br> My lord is not my lord;<br> nor would I know him,<br> Were he in favour<br> as in humour alterd.<br> So help
