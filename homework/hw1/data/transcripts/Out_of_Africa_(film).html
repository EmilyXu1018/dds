I was just...<br> - I'm afraid...<br> - No, it's all right.<br> I'm afraid you've<br> caught me snooping.<br> It's not my room. It's Denys's.<br> And Denys won't mind.<br> That's the thing about Denys.<br> Are you Cole?<br> Berkeley Cole.<br> I brought the ivory with me<br> on the train.<br> Well, thank you.<br> - You taking your quinine?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> He has got lovely books.<br> - Does he lend them?<br> - We had a friend...<br> Hopworth, he'd got a book<br> from Denys and didn't return it.<br> Denys was furious.<br> I said to Denys...<br> "You wouldn't lose a friend<br> for the sake of a book."<br> He said, "No, but he has,<br> hasn't he?"<br> - Did you come out through London?<br> - No, from Rome, actually.<br> I thought you might<br> have a newspaper.<br> No. Sorry.<br> Oh, nothing in them anyway.<br> I had a friend who I used to take<br> to the dances at Oxford.<br> They were in June<br> by the river.<br> She always wore<br> a new silk dress.<br> I think you're<br> wearing her perfume.<br> It's very nice,<br> but it's not the same.<br> We can go now.<br> This is Belknap.<br> - He runs the farm.<br> - Good evening, ma'am.<br> This is your cook.<br> Name's Esa.<br> And this is Juma. Houseboy.<br> Come. See your house.<br> When you leave me,<br> I'm going to marry Berkeley Cole.<br> - A man in trade.<br> - Is that what he does?<br> He's thick with the Somalis.<br> There's a crowd of them on his land<br> who think he's a prince.<br> He sells<br> Finch Hatton's ivory.<br> Belknap is a cheery sort.<br> Had a place of his own.<br> Went belly up trying to grow flax.<br> - Does he know cattle?<br> - I didn't buy cattle.<br> We're going to grow<br> coffee instead.<br> That's not what we planned.<br> You were in Denmark.<br> I had to decide.<br> We made a decision.<br> We don't know anything<br> about coffee.<br> - You plant it, it grows.<br> - We said a dairy. My mother...<br> Your mother doesn't care if it's cows<br> or coffee as long as it pays.<br> You have to be with a herd<br> or things go wrong.<br> I didn't come to Africa<br> to sit with silly cows.<br> Just tell her we changed our minds.<br> Next time you change your mind...<br> you do it with your money.<br> They bought you a title, Baronessa.<br> They didn't buy me.<br> Fetch some wine<br> for my lover's brother.<br> I think you're tired.<br> Be careful.<br> Did I tell you<br> Hans came to say goodbye?<br> Where is Baron Blixen?<br> - He's gone to hunt.<br> - Did he say when he'd return?<br> He says he can come<br> before the rain.<br> Is it going to rain today?<br> It can be many days<br> before the rain, msabu.<br> In Ohio we put up scarecrow<br> to keep the birds away.<br> Here, you hope there's enough leopard<br> to keep down the baboon.<br> They'll take your dog too.<br> But that's Africa.<br> - How much will we plant?<br> - A thousand acres.<br> - How long will that take?<br> - That depends on Kinanjui.<br> He's chief of the Kikuyu.<br> Gotta deal with him to get your help.<br> - When will be our first harvest?<br> - Well, these are seedlings.<br> It'll be three,<br> maybe four years.<br> - Four years?<br> - If they bear at all.<br> No one's ever<br> tried coffee this high.<br> - What will we live on for four years?<br> - I'm working to get home.<br> If you haven't got it, be good<br> if you could tell me right now.<br> We will plant 500.<br> Chief Kinanjui,<br> I've heard you're wise...<br> Not now, please.<br> And I look forward<br> to our dealings.<br> Your Kikuyu are good workers...<br> and I look forward<br> to dealing with them...<br> honestly and fairly.<br> Msabu, this chief<br> has no British.<br> - Tell him I am Baroness Blixen.<br> - Chief knows that, msabu.<br> Well, then tell him what I said.<br> What did he say?<br> He says this Kikuyu<br> can do this work.<br> What else did he...<br> Your leg is very sick.<br> You must come<br> to the house for medicine.<br> - Does he understand me?<br> - Yes, msabu.<br> If you don't come, the other boys<br> will say you are afraid.<br> I, myself, will think<br> only that you are foolish.<br> This boy must<br> come to my house for treatment.<br> See that he does.<br> What else did Kinanjui say?<br> He says coffee<br> must not grow this high.<br> Never mind, msabu.<br> He's a chief, but he's a Kikuyu.<br> If you put a dam here<br> to stop the water...<br> then I can make a pond here.<br> - Do you know how...<br> - This water must go home to Mombasa.<br> It can go home<br> after we make a pond.<br> Msabu, this water lives at Mombasa.<br> Come, then.<br> I wouldn't run.<br> If you do, she'll think<br> you're something good to eat.<br> Have you...<br> Do you have a gun?<br> She won't like<br> the smell of you.<br> Shoot it.<br> She's had breakfast.<br> Don't...<br> - Please, shoot her.<br> - No, let's give her a moment.<br> Oh, my God, shoot her!<br> Just how much closer<br> did you expect to let her come?<br> A bit.<br> She wanted to see if you'd run. That's<br> how they decide. A lot like people.<br> - She almost had me for lunch!<br> - It wasn't her fault. She's a lion.<br> - It wasn't mine.<br> - Doesn't that outfit come with a rifle?<br> It's on my saddle.<br> Better keep it with you.<br> Your horse isn't much of a shot.<br> For Berkeley.<br> He's brought you presents.<br> We stopped by your house<br> and them came looking for you.<br> Good Lord, you're sweet.<br> On the road, actually. We're off<br> to Magadi to shoot some ivory.<br> Now, at least, I have something good<br> to offer you.<br> Did you intend to tell Berkeley<br> what a fool I was?<br> - She had a lion a bit interested.<br> - A bit?<br> But not enough to bite.<br> It's all right to take a chance...<br> as long as it's you who'll pay.<br> - Wouldn't you say so?<br> - It's the sort of thing you'd say.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Not at all. Where's Blix?<br> - Hunting.<br> - Has he been out long?<br> Yes.<br> You'll need a good chat, then.<br> Shall we stay to supper, Denys?<br> - Blix will have jackets we could use.<br> - Do I have anything to say in this?<br> - Not really, but we'll hear you out.<br> - Then I would like you to stay.<br> Good. Denys.<br> I don't know. Do you sing?<br> Never.<br> Can you tell a story?<br> I happen to be<br> very good at stories.<br> I believe that.<br> What's happened to the cows, the dairy?<br> We changed our minds.<br> We'll grow coffee instead.<br> - A bit risky, this high.<br> - So I've been told.<br> - Didn't seem to bother you.<br> - I think they just haven't tried.<br> Every time I turn my back,<br> it wants to go wild again.<br> It will go wild.<br> - Your man...<br> - Kanuthia.<br> - He's not Kikuyu.<br> - No.<br> Shall I see<br> that he's given supper?<br> Don't do anything<br> for him, thank you, Baroness.<br> It's true of all Somalis. They're<br> the only tribe that knows horses.<br> They don't drink, charge interest<br> or chase other men's wives.<br> Got to go to town for that.<br> Did you know that<br> in all of literature...<br> there's no poem<br> celebrating the foot.<br> There's lips, eyes, hands, face...<br> hair, breasts...<br> legs, arms,<br> even the knees.<br> But not one verse<br> for the poor foot.<br> - Why do you think that is?<br> - Priorities, I suppose.<br> Did you think<br> you would make one?<br> Problem is there's nothing<br> to rhyme it with.<br> - Put.<br> - It's not a noun.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> Along he came and he did put...<br> upon my farm his clumsy foot.<br> We should have a story now.<br> When I tell a story<br> to my nieces at home...<br> one of them always provides<br> the first sentence.<br> - Anything?<br> - Absolutely anything.<br> There was a wandering Chinese<br> named Cheng Huan...<br> living in Limehouse...<br> and a girl named Shirley.<br> Who spoke perfect Chinese...<br> which she learned<br> from her missionary parents.<br> Cheng Huan lived alone<br> in a room on Formosa Street...<br> above the Blue Lantern.<br> He sat at his window...<br> and in his poor listening heart...<br> strange echoes<br> of his home and country...<br> They found them there<br> the next morning...<br> in their room<br> above the Blue Lantern...<br> the dead child<br> and the warlord...<br> with Cheng Huan's love gift<br> coiled about his neck.<br> Had you been to those places?<br> I have been a mental traveller.<br> - Till now.<br> - Yes.<br> Was this England?<br> Excuse me. Denmark?<br> I like my things.<br> When you travelled before<br> in your mind...<br> did you carry<br> so much luggage?<br> A mental traveller hasn't the need<br> to eat or sleep...<br> or entertain.<br> You're right.<br> Anyway, aren't you pleased<br> that I brought my crystal and china?<br> And your stories, yes.<br> The conquering heroes come<br> Sound the trumpets<br> Beat the drums<br> - I want you to come often.<br> - I'd like that very much.<br> - And you must promise it will be soon.<br> - I promise.<br> Did you save my life,<br> Finch Hatton?<br> No. The lioness did that.<br> She walked away.<br> So I'm not indebted, then?<br> Ah, but I am.<br> We pay our<br> storytellers here.<br> It's lovely.<br> But my stories are free...<br> and your present's<br> much too dear.<br> Write them down sometime.<br> Take care, Finch Hatton.<br> You wouldn't<br> rather call me Denys?<br> Baroness.<br> Goodbye.<br> What are you doing?<br> I want you to come home.<br> We never spoke<br> about children.<br> Did you...<br> Do you?<br> Yes.

One question at a time.<br> The war is in Europe. How do we know<br> they're going to reach here?<br> German East is only 200 miles south.<br> General von Lettow is there.<br> I don't want to wait<br> until he joins us at the bar.<br> - Would we engage them?<br> - Blix, this is our war.<br> You don't have to be involved,<br> but thanks.<br> I've got crops coming in.<br> How long's this thing gonna last?<br> We just have to stay<br> and go as we must.<br> They won't fight<br> if we won't fight.<br> We could always arm the Masai<br> and point them south.<br> Do you want the job of collecting rifles<br> from the Masai when this is over?<br> What about our women and children?<br> Should we bring them into town?<br> We will deal with that problem<br> as it arises.<br> - Will they use native troops?<br> - I'd assume so, but not Masai.<br> Berkeley, what about your Somalis?<br> They'd make very good scouts. We could<br> cover the area from here to the border.<br> We could gather information<br> for when the regulars arrive.<br> What's it about?<br> Have you any idea?<br> - Not really.<br> - Then why do you want to get into it?<br> - Well...<br> - It's got nothing to do with us.<br> They've made agreements<br> we know nothing about.<br> Victoria and the Kaiser were<br> relatives, for God's sake.<br> They've divided Africa between them.<br> Do you know why there's a border?<br> Because she had two mountains,<br> and he had none.<br> So she gave him Kilimanjaro.<br> It's a silly argument<br> between two spoiled countries.<br> The sooner it ends, the sooner<br> we pick up where we left off.<br> It may end...<br> but we're not going to<br> pick up where we left off.<br> You don't have to go.<br> - You want to go.<br> - We've got to live here.<br> They have made it plain<br> they don't want you.<br> - I'll have to show them where we stand.<br> - I'm not so fond of their empire...<br> I'd have you shot for it.<br> More likely<br> chewed on than shot.<br> The farm will take care of itself,<br> and you've got Belknap.<br> The farm will not<br> take care of itself.<br> That's not the point.<br> I didn't expect<br> to like you so much.<br> You're not going to go<br> falling in love, are you?<br> Not with someone<br> who's always leaving.<br> If you need me,<br> send a runner to find Delamere.<br> That's where I'll be.<br> That's a fine kiss goodbye.<br> I am better at hello.<br> It's an odd feeling... farewell.<br> There is some envy in it.<br> Men go off to be tested<br> for courage.<br> If we're tested at all,<br> it's for patience...<br> for doing without...<br> for how well<br> we can endure loneliness.<br> But I had always known that.<br> It didn't require a war.<br> I said goodbye to Bror.<br> Denys left without a word...<br> which was quite proper.<br> Hello, the house!<br> Felicity!<br> I thought you might<br> want some meat.<br> - Is there any word?<br> - No, nothing new.<br> Not much fighting.<br> Awful fever, though.<br> I've got time for tea,<br> I should think.<br> Are you for the Germans?<br> Did they send you out<br> to ask me this?<br> - We had a row about it in town.<br> - Because of my bad English.<br> And whose side were you on?<br> Yours.<br> They want to send me home to school.<br> Mother says I'm growing up wild.<br> - I wanted to ask you about it.<br> - Me?<br> You've been round and about.<br> Someday, I'd like<br> to run my own show the way you do.<br> - Is that what I do?<br> - You don't seem to need us much.<br> Baroness, may I<br> ask you something?<br> I don't know much about men.<br> I want them to like me,<br> but I...<br> I want to be let alone too.<br> I'm supposed to want<br> to be taken, aren't I?<br> I've got this book.<br> But how do you know when to do<br> what they want you to...<br> and when not to?<br> I suppose you<br> ought to call me Karen.<br> They need paraffin and tinned food,<br> enough for 300 men.<br> He wants you to send a white man<br> with the wagon.<br> - Is he all right?<br> - Well enough to send the message.<br> And where would my husband<br> like this wagon sent?<br> He's with Delamere<br> on the border near Lake Natron.<br> That's confidential,<br> of course.<br> I will bear that<br> in mind, Lieutenant.<br> I only meant it wouldn't do<br> for it to be talk around Nairobi.<br> And we're going to have to move you<br> into town. We can't protect you here.<br> What do you mean?<br> With the men gone, we're worried about<br> the native element. We have orders.<br> Women and children into town.<br> That is internment, Lieutenant.<br> Women and children, Baroness.<br> - Is that one category or two?<br> - You'll want time to gather your things.<br> I'll send an escort<br> for you Thursday.<br> And I'm a captain, Baroness.<br> I'm not paid<br> to fight, Mrs Blixen.<br> Where is Lake Natron?<br> It's south, bush country.<br> It's no place<br> for a white man.<br> We should have crossed<br> the Sand River today.<br> I may have got us lost.<br> God is great, msabu.<br> - What the devil are you doing here?<br> - I'm on my way to Delamere.<br> Ridiculous.<br> We don't send women to war.<br> I'm going.<br> We haven't time for this.<br> You don't even know where you are.<br> I do now.<br> - You'll just get lost again.<br> - I'm going on.<br> - Talk to her, will you?<br> - No.<br> - She could be hurt or worse.<br> - I imagine she knows that.<br> Right.

Take good care.<br> - We're behind a story or two.<br> - Yes. When I get back.<br> Back? From where?<br> When you get back, I meant.<br> - I thought it was malaria.<br> - Well, it wasn't.<br> You may be all right,<br> but you have to be seen.<br> And the others,<br> whoever they are.<br> I hope they've got it.<br> It's my fault. No one else's.<br> I want to go with you.<br> No. Someone has to stay here<br> and run things.<br> And the factory<br> must be finished.<br> - Can you do that?<br> - That's little enough.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Where is memsahib?<br> She can come soon enough.<br> Later that day,<br> I left for Mombasa...<br> and the voyage home to Denmark.<br> It was a longer journey this time.<br> The war went on.<br> I fought my own war.<br> Arsenic was my ally...<br> against an enemy I never saw.<br> I stayed in the room<br> where I was born...<br> in Rungstedland...<br> and tried to remember<br> the colours of Africa.<br> There was only the medicine...<br> and walks with my mother...<br> along a deserted stretch of beach...<br> and this room in my mother's house.<br> Denmark had become<br> a stranger to me...<br> and I to her.<br> But my mother's house<br> I came to know again.<br> And knew I would<br> come back to it...<br> sick or well...<br> sane or mad someday.<br> And so I did...<br> after Tsavo.<br> Almost everyone's<br> got them now.<br> I am cooking now, memsahib.<br> Yes, I have heard about this.<br> Are you well, Farah Aden?<br> I am well enough, msabu.<br> Then I am well enough also.<br> - What will you do?<br> - I have been thinking I'll hunt.<br> Safari sort of thing.<br> They say it'll be quite a business<br> once the war is over.<br> You wouldn't want to teach?<br> I would like these Kikuyu<br> to have a school.<br> There will be<br> a fight about that.<br> Are you all well?<br> They say I'm cured.<br> I won't have children.<br> Have you thought about us?<br> Of course.<br> Belknap says the coffee will flower<br> after the next rains.<br> If it does...<br> you'll have start thinking about<br> hiring for the harvest...<br> and how you'll get to market.<br> - Where would Berkeley be?<br> - He must be here.<br> Who won the match?<br> Have you got a story for me?<br> I've been demoted.<br> I was Denys last time.<br> Would you care<br> for some champagne?<br> They said you<br> went home for a while.<br> Yes. Where is Berkeley?<br> It's good to see you.<br> He's still down with fever.<br> He'll be all right.<br> Who are all these people?<br> Bror says we'll be a colony soon.<br> Yes. They want it settled now.<br> There's a lottery.<br> Buy a ticket, win a farm in Africa.<br> Did you really think it would<br> stay the way it was?<br> I thought it might.<br> - Where is Kanuthia?<br> - He's dead.<br> How are you?<br> Would you join us for a drink?<br> It's time to find a pillow.<br> - Another night then?<br> - Yeah.<br> Have a good Christmas.<br> Christmas.<br> So it is.<br> This Chief says<br> children higher than this...<br> must not learn to read.<br> Tell him all the children<br> must go to school.<br> No. This is a chief.<br> - You are not a chief.<br> - That's absurd.<br> It's not good for tall people<br> to know more than this chief.<br> When these children are tall...<br> then this chief can be dead.<br> Bror, yes. But Denys hired out<br> to tourists? I can't imagine.<br> He's got no other trade.<br> Besides, we've got no choice.<br> The government's<br> put a stop to the ivory.<br> - What will you do?<br> - I'll concentrate on the farm.<br> Hello, the house!<br> Felicity!<br> How is it you're home?<br> I'm out. Look.<br> I didn't learn a thing,<br> but I'm wonderfully clean.<br> I'll come see you.<br> You save me a dance, Berkeley.<br> What's this nonsense<br> I hear about a school?<br> I've taken on<br> a young missionary.<br> He's promised me to do the alphabet<br> first and save God for later.<br> Wogs can't even<br> count their goats.<br> - It's none of your business.<br> - Who the devil are you?<br> I wonder if you'd<br> dance with me?<br> You are about to apologize.<br> You do stir things up,<br> Baroness.<br> When they said they liked to read,<br> how did they put that, exactly?<br> Do they know they'd like Dickens?<br> - You don't think they should learn?<br> - I think you might have asked them.<br> Did you ask to learn<br> when you were a child?<br> How can stories<br> possibly harm them?<br> They have their own stories.<br> They're just not written down.<br> And what stake to you have<br> in keeping them ignorant?<br> They're not ignorant.<br> I just don't think they should be<br> turned into little Englishmen.<br> - You do like to change things.<br> - For the better, I hope.<br> I want my Kikuyu<br> to learn to read.<br> "My Kikuyu." "My Limoges."<br> "My farm."<br> It's a lot to own.<br> I have paid a price<br> for everything I own.<br> What is it, exactly,<br> that's yours?<br> We're not owners here.<br> We're just passing through.<br> Is life really<br> so damn simple for you?<br> Perhaps I ask less<br> of it than you do.<br> - I don't believe that.<br> - Happy new year!<br> Should auld acquaintance<br> be forgot<br> And never brought to mind<br> Should auld acquaintance<br> be forgot<br> For the sake of auld lang syne<br> For auld lang syne, my dear<br> For auld lang syne<br> We'll drink a cup<br> of kindness here<br> For the sake<br> of auld lang syne<br> We'll drink a cup<br> God save...<br> Our gracious king<br> Long live our noble king<br> God save our king<br> Send him victorious<br> Happy and glorious<br> Happy new year, Karen.<br> And for you too.<br> God save the king<br> Someone has left<br> her underclothes in the back.<br> I want you to take<br> a place in town.<br> Are you sure?<br> Eat.<br> Elephant.<br> Give me work.<br> We've got peace.<br> Where is the prosperity?<br> Why should prices fall now just<br> because we're not killing anybody?<br> Well, tea's down just as bad.<br> Do they always have<br> to whip them so?<br> Look. They finally made<br> a machine that's really useful.<br> Listen.<br> It's for you.<br> - I can't accept it.<br> - Why not?<br> Bror's moved to town.<br> That's a private matter,<br> I imagine.<br> Did you think you<br> would spend the night?<br> Can't, thanks.<br> I have to go down to the Mara.<br> I've taken up safari work,<br> and I've got to find a camp.<br> There's country there<br> you ought to see.<br> It won't last long now.<br> No. I would be<br> wasting your time.<br> Why don't you get your things?<br> If you like me at all...<br> don't ask me to do this.<br> What's your word?<br> Shoo?<br> Is that it? Shoo?<br> That's a fine word<br> you've got there, Baroness.<br> Crank it again, will you?<br> Almost. Crank it again.<br> Again.<br> Once more.<br> Well done. We're off.<br> I don't know<br> the scientific basis for it...<br> but I know you can see further in the<br> African night than any other place.<br> And the stars are brighter.<br> It's about the tents.<br> When I'm out with Kanuthia...<br> it used to be<br> we didn't use them.<br> I remember him.<br> There was something...<br> Masai.<br> He was half Masai.<br> That's what you remember about him.<br> They're like nobody else.<br> We think we'll tame them...<br> but we won't.<br> If you put them in prison,<br> they die.<br> - Why?<br> - Because they live now.<br> They don't think<br> about the future.<br> They can't grasp the idea<br> that they'll be let out one day.<br> They think it's permanent.<br> So they die.<br> They're the only ones out here<br> that don't care about us...<br> and that is what<br> will finish them.<br> What did the two of you<br> ever find to talk about?<br> Nothing.<br> So. You knew I would come.<br> It's an early day tomorrow.<br> Why don't you get some sleep?<br> - And what happens tomorrow?<br> - I have no idea.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> You would think<br> they would run off.<br> You didn't.<br> Think of that.<br> Never a man-made sound,<br> and then Mozart.<br> - Have you clients already?<br> - In a week.<br> A man from Belgium<br> and his daughters.<br> His letter said,<br> "We'd like three of everything."<br> It'll be an interesting trip.<br> I'll be gone a month...<br> or an hour and a half.<br> Why are you doing this?<br> I don't know how to sew.<br> Do you know what they're<br> made of? Cloth.<br> Where will he land?<br> Trick is not to.<br> It must feel amazing.<br> It's how I imagined<br> America to be.<br> - Have you been to America?<br> - No, but my father was there.<br> He told me stories about it<br> when I was a little girl.<br> - Are you still close?<br> - He died.<br> He killed himself<br> when I was ten years old.<br> I can fix that, I think.<br> "Laughed loud and long...<br> and all the while<br> his eyes went to and fro.<br> 'Ha ha,' quoth he,<br> 'full plain I see.<br> The devil knows how to row.'<br> -

"F."<br> - "F."<br> - "G."<br> - "G."<br> "G" for girl.<br> Are you packed?<br> Yes.<br> How was town?<br> Crowded.<br> I've been thinking.<br> With all the safari work,<br> I have little use for the room...<br> at the club.<br> I don't know<br> that I'd be any good at this...<br> but how would it be if I kept<br> a few things with you?<br> You would come and go<br> from my house?<br> If that's all right.<br> When the gods want to punish you,<br> they answer your prayers.<br> Berkeley's dying.<br> - What?<br> - Black water fever.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - I'll go to him.<br> - No, he wouldn't want you there.<br> Why?<br> There's a woman there.<br> She's Somali.<br> She's been with him<br> for some time.<br> You never told me this.<br> I didn't know.<br> "...with each one of us now<br> and forevermore." Amen.<br> Strange that Denys isn't here.<br> I think he is off with Berkeley.<br> In the days and hours<br> that Denys was at home...<br> we spoke of nothing ordinary.<br> Not of my troubles<br> with the farm...<br> my notes due<br> and my failing crop...<br> or of his, with his work...<br> what he knew was happening<br> to Africa.<br> Or of anything at all<br> that was small and real.<br> We lived disconnected...<br> and apart from things.<br> I had been making up stories<br> while he was away.<br> In the evenings,<br> he made himself comfortable...<br> spreading cushions like a couch<br> in front of the fire.<br> And with me sitting cross-legged<br> like Shahrazade herself...<br> he would listen, clear eyed,<br> to a long tale...<br> from when it began<br> until it ended.<br> Where did you get it?<br> Mombasa.<br> Get in.<br> When did you learn to fly?<br> Yesterday.<br> Don't move.<br> I want to move.<br> Don't move.<br> Tanne, may I see you?<br> Well, I'm broke too, you know?<br> I wouldn't ask,<br> but tips were a bit light.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - If I get a decent crop.<br> I could shoot him.<br> I've got this terrible urge<br> to kiss you.<br> He is smarter than I am.<br> It may go well.<br> Good luck, Tanne.<br> You might have asked.<br> I did.<br> She said yes.<br> If I get eaten up some time,<br> bury me here, will you?<br> Whatever's left.<br> Just there,<br> at the crest of the hill.<br> When are you leaving?<br> Tomorrow.<br> Doesn't it matter to you<br> that I'm another man's wife?<br> What matters to me<br> is that you tried so hard.<br> What time tomorrow?<br> Goodbye again.<br> How many acres under cultivation?<br> - Five hundred.<br> - The rest of it's wild?<br> - Well, the Kikuyu live there.<br> - Why don't you move them off?<br> 'Cause they live there.<br> We'll take it over<br> should you default.<br> - We've got another year.<br> - God is great, msabu.<br> He's charging three percent.<br> This chief says...<br> tall children can come<br> to school now.<br> Tell Chief Kinanjui<br> that reading is a valuable thing.<br> His children<br> will remember him well.<br> This chief says, "British can read,<br> and what good has it done them?"<br> Miss Felicity Spurway,<br> clear round.<br> She's quite something,<br> that Felicity.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> The next competitor,<br> Mr John Sutton on Castano.<br> How are you?<br> Getting old, I think.<br> Not you.<br> How is the hunt?<br> I'll make a living.<br> Where is Denys?<br> Uganda. Some potentate.<br> I thought you might<br> be wanting a divorce.<br> Has she got money?<br> Of course she's got money.<br> Is this important<br> I suppose.<br> Well, I'll have to accuse you<br> of something.<br> Or did you think you would have it<br> the other way around?<br> Fire away. Whatever.<br> I have surely done it.<br> Thank you, Tanne.<br> How do you manage it...<br> to keep us friends?<br> We started that way.<br> Well, I'll be happy for you,<br> if I can.<br> I remember that quite well.<br> When you go away on safari...<br> are you ever with someone else?<br> I'd be with you<br> if I wanted to be with anyone.<br> - Do you ever get lonely?<br> - Sometimes.<br> Do you ever wonder<br> if I am lonely?<br> No, I don't.<br> Do you think about me at all?<br> - Often.<br> - But not enough to come back.<br> I do come back... all the time.<br> What is it?<br> Nothing.<br> Bror has asked me for a divorce.<br> He found someone that he wants to marry.<br> I just thought<br> we might do that someday.<br> Divorce?<br> How... How would a wedding<br> change things?<br> I would have someone of my own.<br> You wouldn't.<br> What's wrong with marriage, anyway?<br> Have you ever seen one<br> you admire?<br> Yes, I have. Many.<br> Belfields, for one.<br> He sent her home<br> for the rains in 1910.<br> Didn't tell her they were over<br> till 1913.<br> It's not a joke. People marry.<br> It's not revolutionary.<br> - There are animals that mate for life.<br> - Geese.<br> You use the damn animals<br> for your own argument.<br> You won't let me use them for mine.<br> I'd mate for life.<br> One day at a time.<br> I'd just like someone<br> to ask me once, that's all.<br> Promise me you'll do that,<br> if I promise to say no?<br> Just trust you, eh?<br> When you go away...<br> you don't always go<br> on safari, do you?<br> Just want to be away.<br> It's not meant to hurt you.<br> It does.<br> I'm with you because<br> I choose to be with you.<br> I don't want to live<br> someone else's idea of how to live.<br> Don't ask me to do that.<br> I don't want to find out one day that<br> I'm at the end of someone else's life.<br> I'm willing to pay for mine.<br> To be lonely sometimes.<br> To die alone, if I have to.<br> I think that's fair.<br> Not quite.<br> You want me to pay for it as well.<br> No, you have a choice, and you're<br> not willing to do the same for me.<br> I won't be closer to you...<br> and I won't love you more<br> because of a piece of paper.<br> See if you can shore it up.<br> Move away.<br> Let it go.<br> This water lives in Mombasa anyway.<br> I flew as far as Narok.<br> You could see all the ruts<br> where the lorries had been.<br> The Serengeti was still good.<br> Take a week just getting there.<br> And Samburu is still good.<br> Where's Belknap?<br> I haven't seen him.<br> He must be in America by now.<br> I let him go.<br> I had to. But you don't want<br> to hear about the farm, do you?<br> - L... Have you got any buttons?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Mending your shirt.<br> - Don't.<br> Don't do that.<br> You don't have to do that.<br> Maybe I'll try Samburu<br> day after tomorrow.<br> You just got back.<br> You know,<br> Felicity asked to come along...<br> and I almost said no<br> because I thought you wouldn't like it.<br> - There's no reason for her not to come.<br> - Yes, there is. I wouldn't like it.<br> You want her along?<br> I want things that don't matter<br> not to matter.<br> - Then tell her no. Do it for me.<br> - And then? What else would it be?<br> Why is your freedom<br> more important that mine?<br> It isn't. And I've never interfered<br> with your freedom.<br> No. I'm not allowed to need you.<br> Or rely on you,<br> or expect anything from you.<br> I'm free to leave.<br> - But I do need you.<br> - You don't need me.<br> If I die, will you die?<br> You don't need me.<br> You're confused. You've mixed up<br> need with want. You always have.<br> My God. In the world that you would<br> make, there would be no love at all.<br> Or the best kind.<br> The kind we wouldn't have to prove.<br> - You'll be living on the moon then.<br> - Why? Because I won't do it your way?<br> Are we assuming there's one proper way<br> to do all this?<br> Do you think I care about Felicity?<br> Do you think<br> I'll be involved with her?<br> - Then there's no reason for this.<br> - If she's not important...<br> why won't you give it up?<br> I have learned a thing<br> that you haven't.<br> There are some things worth having...<br> but they come at a price,<br> and I want to be one of them.<br> I won't allow it.<br> You have no idea the effect<br> that language has on me.<br> I used to think that there was nothing<br> that you really wanted...<br> but that's not it, is it?<br> You want to have it all.<br> I'm going to Samburu.<br> She can come or not.<br> Then you will be living elsewhere.<br> All right.<br> Is that a prince in there?<br> I think that you had better get up,<br> memsahib.<br> - What?<br> - I think that you had better get up.<br> I think that God is coming.<br> All gone.<br> - How did it start?<br> - I think God had a hand in it.<br> He gave me my best crop ever,<br> and then He remembered.<br> - Insurance?<br> - That's for pessimists.<br> Where is Denys?<br> Who knows?<br> Doesn't matter.<br> The baroness is broke, "D."<br> It's over.<br> I've got to find some land<br> before I go, for my Kikuyu.<br> You've trouble enough, Karen.<br> Just a chunk somewhere,<br> so they can stay all together.<br> We're just out of coffee...<br> but I can give you tea.<br> There is no arable land that size<br> outside the reserve...<br> and if there were,<br> we'd not put natives on it.<br> - Since it's theirs.<br> - It belongs to the crown, Baroness.<br> What you want is quite impossible.<br> Yes, it always is.<br> Who must I see next?<br> You've run through us all,<br> I'm afraid.<br> We have a new governor,<br> haven't we?<br> Sir Joseph?<br> He hasn't arrived yet.<br> But will soon, I'm told.<br> You do still ask me to things?<br> Captain Jacques Llewllyn.<br> - Your servant, sir.<br> - Mr Llewllyn.<br> The honourable Hugh Chomondeley,<br> Lord Delamere.<br> - Your servant, sir.<br> - Lady Delamere.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Lady Delamere.<br> - Commissioner.<br> - Baroness.<br> The Baroness von Blixen.<br> I'm sorry to know<br> that Kenya will be losing you.<br> - You have heard of my trouble then?<br> - Yes.<br> I regret it.<br> - And do you know of my problem now?<br> - Baroness.<br> - This land you want from us.<br> - Will you help me, Sir Joseph?<br> - Baroness, this really isn't the time.<br> - That's quite difficult.<br> - Baroness.<br> - Please, get up.<br> Kenya is a hard country<br> for women...<br> so there is a chivalry here,<br> of a sort.<br> You are a powerful man,<br> and I have no one else to turn to.<br> Let's discuss this<br> in the proper way.<br> You mustn't be embarrassed.<br> I've lost everything.<br> - It costs me very little to beg you.<br> - Wait.<br> Give her a moment, please.<br> This land was theirs, you see.<br> We took it,<br> and now they have nowhere else to go.<br> I'll look into it.<br> We'll do the best we can.<br> May I have your word, sir?<br> You have mine.<br> Thank you.<br> I hope you will be happy here.<br> I was.<br> I'm sorry I won't know you.<br> I didn't hear it<br> until I got to the border.<br> It seems I'll do almost anything<br> to get your attention.<br> I've nearly got you packed.<br> And my poor family,<br> I've got them near bankrupt.<br> Now I have to ask them for more money.<br> - Let me help you.<br> - You would keep me, then?<br> No. I want to be<br> worth something now.<br> What will you do?<br> After my rummage sale, leave.<br> Friday for Mombasa, and then...<br> the boat to Denmark.<br> Thank you.<br> You must have them ready to leave<br> before the rains.<br> It is good land, enough for all.<br> But they must not fight about it<br> or be any trouble to the authorities.<br> Do you understand?<br> Or they will lose it.<br> You must make them understand<br> that I will not be here...<br> to speak for them.<br> This land is far?<br> Not too far.<br> How can it be now<br> with me and yourself?<br> You will have some money.<br> Enough, I think.<br> I do not speak of money.<br> Do you remember how it was...<br> on safari?<br> In the afternoons I would<br> send you ahead to look for a camp...<br> and you would wait for me.<br> You can see the fire...<br> and come to this place.<br> Yes.<br> Well, it will be like that.<br> Only this time I will go ahead<br> and wait for you.<br> It is far,<br> where you are going?<br> Yes.<br> You must make this fire very big...<br> so I can find you.<br> Take that out to the lawn.<br> Have you had dinner?<br> Yes.<br> Your things...<br> I packed your things.<br> I thought I would send them<br> on to the club.<br> Is that all right?<br> This wasn't a very good idea.<br> I think we should have<br> had it this way all the time.<br> I don't know.<br> I was beginning to like<br> your things.<br> And I was beginning to like<br> living without them.<br> You've ruined it for me,<br> you know.<br> Ruined what?<br> Being alone.<br> Have I?<br> I'd like to come with you<br> to Mombasa.<br> Can I fly you there?<br> Aren't you going away again?<br> I have some things to do tomorrow<br> at Tsavo, but I'll be back on Friday.<br> Will that be all right?<br> Of course.<br> I've got this little thing<br> that I've learned to do lately.<br> When it gets so bad...<br> and I think I can't go on...<br> I try to make it worse.<br> I make myself think about our camp<br> on the river...<br> and Berkeley...<br> and the first time<br> that you took me flying.<br> How good it all was.<br> And when I'm certain<br> that I can't stand it...<br> I go one moment more.<br> And then I know<br> I can bear anything.<br> Would you like to help me?<br> Yes.<br> Come dance with me then.<br> You were right, you know.<br> The farm never did belong to me.<br> I may have been wrong.<br> I had a farm in Africa.<br> - Friday.<br> - Yes.<br> Would you like a drink?<br> Please.<br> Denys has been killed.<br> His plane crashed at Tsavo.<br> There was a fire.<br> Can I take you into town, Tanne?<br> Why did they send you?<br> I thought I should.<br> My God, you are brave.<br> "The sun shall not smite thee by day,<br> nor the moon at night.<br> The Lord shall preserve thee<br> from all evil.<br> He shall preserve thy soul.<br> The Lord shall preserve thy going out<br> and thy coming in.<br> From this time forth<br> and even forevermore."<br> Amen.<br> "The time you won<br> your town the race...<br> we chaired you<br> through the marketplace.<br> Man and boy stood cheering by...<br> as home we brought you,<br> shoulder high.<br> Smart lad,<br> to slip betimes away...<br> from fields where glory<br> does not stay.<br> Early though<br> the laurel grows...<br> it withers quicker than a rose.<br> Now you will not swell the rout...<br> of lads that wore their honours out.<br> Runners whom renown outran...<br> and the name died...<br> before the man.<br> And round that early laurelled head...<br> will flock to gaze<br> the strengthless dead...<br> and find unwithered on its curls...<br> a garland...<br> briefer than a girl's."<br> Now take back the soul<br> of Denys George Finch Hatton...<br> whom You have shared with us.<br> He brought us joy...<br> and we loved him well.<br> He was not ours.<br> He was not mine.<br> If I know a song of Africa...<br> of the giraffe...<br> and the African new moon<br> lying on her back...<br> of the ploughs in the fields...<br> and the sweaty faces<br> of the coffee pickers...<br> does Africa know a song of me?<br> Will the air over the plain quiver...<br> with a colour that I have had on?<br> Or will the children invent a game...<br> in which my name is?<br> Or the full moon throw a shadow...<br> over the gravel of the drive...<br> that was like me?<br> Or will the eagles of the Ngong Hills<br> look out for me?<br> You cannot come where I am going.<br> There is no cooking<br> where you are going?<br> You would not like it there.<br> You must trust me about this.<br> Letters you can send on<br> to this address in Denmark.<br> When you sell the car, if you would<br> send the cheque to Hunter and Company...<br> and anything else you don't know<br> what to do with.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Baroness, I've been sent to ask<br> if we may stand you a drink.<br> -
