                        Here, Charlie. More fortune cookies.<br> - Good luck!<br> - Thanks! What?<br> Next week, we'll be selling<br> Sanyo remote control VCRs for $299!<br> - Look, it's Dad!<br> - Oh, no! I'll go broke!<br> To give away Mitsubishi<br> giant-screen television sets for $1,299!<br> Oh, no!<br> We won't be undersold on microwaves,<br> videorecorders, ovens...<br> - Mom, you're not looking.<br> - Please turn that off.<br> Mom, when are you going to stop<br> being mad at Dad?<br> I mean, how do you think<br> that makes me feel?<br> I have certain unresolved feelings<br> about your father.<br> I don't trust him.<br> - And I hate those commercials.<br> - All right, forget it.<br> We don't have time<br> for another heart-to-heart.<br> Come on. You have to get dressed.<br> - I want you to understand it's insulting...<br> - Watch your hair.<br> ...for him to go from me to that bimbo.<br> Do you think he really loves Janet?<br> Maybe he's just smashed<br> too many fortune cookies!<br> Mom, give me a break!<br> He's missing the reunion because of you.<br> You know he's dying to go.<br> At least we won't both have<br> a miserable time.<br> Let me see.<br> What do you think?<br> You are a very hip chick!<br> God, you look like you've stepped<br> right out of Life magazine!<br> I don't know.<br> What if nobody else there<br> is dressed like this?<br> So?<br> - I don't think I wanna go.<br> - Mom.<br> Everybody's just gonna say,<br> "Well, hey, where's Crazy Charlie?"<br> Lots of people are separated and divorced.<br> Not from the guy<br> with the lowest prices in town.<br> I feel ridiculous in this dress!<br> I'd like to change.<br> Why are you so nervous?<br> What's the matter?<br> Reunions do funny things<br> to people at this age.<br> - Hi, Peggy Sue! Beth!<br> - Hi.<br> Hi, Maddy.<br> How are you?<br> You two look<br> just like that soap commercial.<br> - "Which one's the mother?"<br> - "And which one's the daughter?"<br> You took this seriously.<br> You're a real blast from the past!<br> It was Beth's idea.<br> I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi! Peggy Sue Bodell?<br> - All right.<br> - Mom?<br> Beth's boyfriend is with the band.<br> - Must run in the family.<br> - What does?<br> You and your mother.<br> You both seem to fall for musicians.<br> Mom, look!<br> Oh, God!<br> It's okay. Come on. Look!<br> Why don't you find a table?<br> We'll see you in a little while.<br> Sure.<br> God, Mom, that picture's great!<br> Come on, let's get a table.<br> - Is this good?<br> - Fine.<br> - I'll be right back. You be all right?<br> - Sure.<br> Thank you. We're gonna do<br> a little medley for you now.<br> - Come on, pose like your picture.<br> - What?<br> Hi, do you like it?<br> I figured as everyone has a gold Rolex,<br> I'd have one made in platinum.<br> - What a wonderful idea!<br> - How are you?<br> I'm fine. How many children do you have?<br> - I don't have any.<br> - You don't? I thought you did.<br> - No. How many do you have?<br> - I have four.<br> - Four?<br> - Four, yeah.<br> I'm so happy for you.<br> - I love them so much.<br> - How's Peggy Sue doing?<br> She was a mess,<br> right after they separated.<br> But I think she's coming out of it.<br> Seems to be friendly now.<br> I'm so glad.<br> Sometimes it's easier when you hate them.<br> - How about a little dance, princess?<br> - Walter!<br> - How are you?<br> - Good.<br> - Nice to see you. I'll see you later.<br> - Yeah.<br> Aren't you Peggy Sue Kelcher?<br> I was once. Richard Norvik?<br> I didn't recognise you!<br> You look terrific.<br> You look exactly the same.<br> I feel ridiculous!<br> I only did this for tonight, you know.<br> - It's adorable.<br> - Thank you.<br> Peggy Sue Kelcher, this is my wife, Sharon.<br> - How nice to meet you. Why don't you sit?<br> - Thank you.<br> But call me Peggy. Peggy Bodell now.<br> So, where's Charlie?<br> I was in town about a year ago<br> and I turn on the television...<br> ...and I see Crazy Charlie.<br> It really made me laugh.<br> Charlie won't be here tonight.<br> - We're getting divorced, actually.<br> - I'm sorry to hear that.<br> Mr. Norvik!<br> Richard. Doug Snell, Merrill Lynch.<br> I read about that Codex deal<br> in Business Week. Congratulations!<br> Thank you very much.<br> Peggy, how are you? How's Charlie?<br> Hey, Terry!<br> - Thank you, Doug, thank you very much.<br> - Call me.<br> Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle<br> were high school sweethearts.<br> Married right after graduation,<br> they're still together.<br> Maddy. Arthur. How does it feel<br> to have missed the sexual revolution?<br> What? What kind of question is that?<br> That doesn't have anything to do<br> with the reunion, Delores!<br> Take it easy, kitten.<br> - Welcome to the singles scene.<br> - I don't know how you do it.<br> I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.<br> It's not that bad, really.<br> You just have to think of men like houses,<br> and trade upward.<br> I always thought that you and Charlie<br> had a really great marriage.<br> I think we did.<br> We just got married too young...<br> ...and ended up blaming each other<br> for all the things we missed.<br> So he started having affairs<br> and you started getting depressed?<br> You just should have left here years ago,<br> like I did.<br> It's not so bad.<br> I've got two great kids.<br> I've got my own business.<br> Still, if I knew then what I know now...<br> ...l'd do a lot of things differently.<br> Your damn computers<br> put me out of business.<br> You're right. He's drunk.<br> You're a billionaire<br> and I'm a goddamn failure.<br> No, the bakery's doing very well.<br> - Do you manage it?<br> - I own it.<br> I remember that dress.<br> Rosalie?<br> Oh, no. I remember that locket, too.<br> You were so excited!<br> I think you showed it to the whole school.<br> You have an incredible memory.<br> - It's beautiful. Does it open?<br> - Yes.<br> - These are my children.<br> - They're so cute!<br> Of course, they're not babies anymore!<br> But you were married<br> when you were three, right?<br> God bless you!<br> The best thing about being a dentist.<br> Pure pharmaceutical grade.<br> A couple of lines of this,<br> I could drill my own teeth.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> - Who's the guy with the eyes?<br> - Michael Fitzsimmons.<br> I used to have<br> such a crush on him in school.<br> - Peggy.<br> - Hi!<br> God, that Walter Getz can still dance!<br> Your first boyfriend!<br> Come on, tell me. Any sparks left?<br> Well, who knows?<br> I mean, remember,<br> whatever Walter wants...<br> ...Walter gets!<br> I'm sorry. Sharon Norvik.<br> This is Carol Heath and Maddy Nagle,<br> my oldest and my dearest friends.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Sharon is married to Richard.<br> - Lucky lady!<br> - Thank you.<br> Michael Fitzsimmons. Is he here?<br> No. No, I asked Rosalie.<br> She couldn't track him down.<br> - That's too bad.<br> - He must have been quite a guy.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, he is the only boy in high school<br> I wish I'd gone to bed with!<br> Only one?<br> Well, besides Charlie.<br> I hope the sales of your book go very well.<br> Anything anecdotal<br> you'd like to leave us with?<br> Yeah, every dog has its day.<br> Meaning what?<br> Peggy, would you please rescue Richard?<br> Ask him to dance.<br> Richard. Would you like to dance?<br> Of course I would.<br> So, are we through now?<br> - No.<br> - Good.<br> From snivelling runt<br> to pompous ass in 25 years.<br> That's quite an accomplishment.<br> I really cannot get over this.<br> The only time people like Delores Dodge<br> used to pay any attention to me...<br> ...was to laugh at me or insult me.<br> - You know that guy Doug Snell?<br> - Yeah.<br> He shook my hand<br> when we walked in here?<br> He used to call me, "Four-eyed worm."<br> You showed them all.<br> You're rich and famous and successful...<br> ...and you have a beautiful wife.<br> You were always friendly to me.<br> I appreciated that.<br> It's Crazy Charlie, the appliance king!<br> Hey, Charlie!<br> Look at you! You're putting on<br> a little weight, man!<br> You look great. Great.<br> So, this is the reunion? It's wonderful.<br> Like, wonderful!<br> Are you and Peggy still talking?<br> I mean, is it amicable?<br> She hasn't changed at all, Charlie.<br> - Your daughter's a real doll.<br> - "Why, I oughta..."<br> Hello.<br> Hello!<br> Can I have your attention, please?<br> Listen up! Can I have your attention?<br> I know everybody's having a great time...<br> ...but now, you have to get ready for<br> that moment you've all been waiting for.<br> Dad? Hi.<br> The Reunion Committee has selected<br> a king and a queen.<br> Let's get back to business.<br> The Reunion Committee<br> has given this a lot of thought...<br> ...and decided on two people<br> who best represent the spirit...<br> ...of Buchanan High's Class of '60!<br> What are you doing?<br> The king is someone who,<br> in more ways than one...<br> ...has come a long way since he left here...<br> ...and we are especially proud<br> to welcome him back.<br> Richard Norvik!<br> Come on up here, King Richard!<br> I demand a recount!<br> That's gotta be Getz!<br> First you gotta learn how to count.<br> Hold me back!<br> Well, I just want to say thank you.<br> Sharon and I feel real welcome.<br> We're having a great time.<br> Boy, our high school<br> looks really good from up here.<br> And I just wanna say, it's good to be back.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> - Now, every king deserves a queen.<br> - Over here!<br> Not you, Getz!<br> Life of the party!<br> But when we sent out the invitations...<br> ...we didn't mention anything about<br> this being a costume party...<br> ...and perhaps we should've...<br> ...because just looking at her<br> brings it all back!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I give you our queen...<br> ...Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell!<br> Come on up here, Peggy Sue!<br> I can't. I can't do it.<br> Yes, you can.<br> Go on, you can do it. Go on.<br> You can do it.<br> Congratulations.<br> Thank you, thank you very much.<br> Mom!<br> Now, hold your arm up.<br> Would you like your Twinkie now?<br> Charlie?<br> I want to suck your blood!<br> I also want to suck your Twinkie!<br> - Am I dead?<br> - No. You are the undead.<br> Let's have it. You hate them, anyway.<br> Young man! You stop that!<br> Hey, I just made a deposit in your bank.<br> Now I want to make a withdrawal.<br> I think it's time for your next class.<br> - Go on! All of you!<br> - I'm a little worried about the side effects.<br> Now, you lie back down.<br> What am I doing here?<br> You passed out for a minute, that's all.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> - But how did I get here?<br> - Why don't you let your friends help you?<br> Take her into the washroom<br> and splash some cold water on her face...<br> ...and that should perk her up.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> How are you doing?<br> Blood drive? 1960?<br> Wanna smoke?<br> No, Carol. That's the worst thing for her.<br> I gave them up years ago.<br> - Where is it?<br> - Where's what?<br> Maddy, what did you do to your hair?<br> I'm taking you back to the nurse.<br> - Delores, why aren't you giving blood?<br> - I can't. I'm too anaemic.<br> Maybe you should drink<br> some of that nail polish.<br> It might give you strength.<br> Why don't you come back<br> and show me how?<br> We're going to take you home now.<br> That's okay.<br> I'm sure I can remember the way.<br> Steady now.<br> People get weak when they give blood.<br> It's wonderful Spring Radio.<br> At 1280 on your AM dial,<br> here's more from our golden survey.<br> And now from The Champs,<br> let's party with a little Tequila.<br> - I'll call you later.<br> - Yes! Let's keep in touch.<br> Who is it?<br> Peggy. Peggy Sue.<br> Come on in. I left the door open for you.<br> The nurse called<br> and said you'd be coming home.<br> I have a note.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - I was excused.<br> Why don't you go upstairs<br> and lie down for a while?<br> Oh, Mom!<br> Chanel No. 5.<br> It always reminds me of home.<br> Of course, dear. You're home now.<br> - You sure you're going to be all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> What is going on?<br> Nancy?<br> It's Nancy!<br> My baby sister!<br> - I'm so happy to see you!<br> - What are you doing?<br> Mom said you were sick.<br> You're never happy to see me.<br> I'm sorry! I'm sorry about that.<br> I want us to be closer.<br> I have too many unresolved relationships<br> in my life.<br> Teenagers are weird.<br> And you're the weirdest.<br> You wanna play a game?<br> Come here.<br> How about Monopoly?<br> Or Parcheesi. Or Chutes and Ladders?<br> I have a question.<br> Let me turn the tables on you.<br> Maybe you, down here, don't know.<br> Is there anybody in the house knows<br> where Dion and the Belmonts are?<br> I don't believe it.<br> Look at that man. He never ages.<br> Isn't Kenny Rossi dreamy?<br> I wish he'd break up with Arlene.<br> She thinks she's so great.<br> - Don't eat any of the red ones.<br> - Why not?<br> They're bad for you.<br> They give you red lips.<br> What the hell? I'm probably dead anyway.<br> Peggy Sue, get in here!<br> Dion's almost over.<br> I left your laundry on your beds, girls.<br> Don't forget to put it away, okay?<br> What's for dinner?<br> Creamed chipped beef on toast<br> with rutabagas.<br> Your father's favourite.<br> Not again!<br> Evelyn! Girls?<br> What is this out on the street?<br> Come and take a look!<br> Who left this out here?<br> - What is it, dear?<br> - Come on out and see for yourself!<br> Don't yell. Stop shouting.<br> It's cool!<br> - Dad!<br> - Wait until I tell Diane.<br> She's always bragging<br> about her dad's Cadillac.<br> What do you think, Peggy Sue?<br> Oh, Dad! You were always doing<br> stuff like that! It's funny.<br> It's really funny. You bought an Edsel.<br> Young lady, what's the matter with you?<br> Are you drunk?<br> Just a little. I had a tough day.<br> No, don't wear it out, Nancy!<br> We can't afford a new car.<br> Do we have to take it back?<br> I fail to see the humour of this!<br> Go to your room, you're grounded!<br> - Grounded?<br> - Put that down!<br> That's the story of my life! I'm an adult.<br> I'm going to go to Liverpool<br> and discover The Beatles.<br> Jack, take it easy!<br> She gave blood at school today.<br> - She's a little lightheaded.<br> - This is not giving blood! This is drunk!<br> Dad, I never knew you had<br> a sense of humour.<br> - Evelyn, put her to bed!<br> - Come on, Mom!<br> You're making a mountain<br> out of a molehill.<br> A tempest in a teapot!<br> My little baby.<br> Don't try to grow up so fast.<br> Mom, I forgot you were ever this young.<br> Sleep, baby.<br> Good morning.<br> What happened to your hair, Peggy?<br> You have such a pretty face.<br> - Why are you always trying to cover it up?<br> - I forgot.<br> - 'Morning.<br> - 'Morning.<br> Excuse me.<br> Nancy, put your homework down<br> and sit down.<br> You're looking bright and chipper<br> this morning.<br> I'm still here.<br> I thought I might as well enjoy myself.<br> I think I'll go to school today.<br> You know, Dad, I'm sorry about yesterday.<br> The Edsel is a classic.<br> Use it in the best of health.<br> Well, thank you.<br> But don't ever let anything<br> like that happen again.<br> You're far too young<br> to start acquiring bad habits.<br> I agree. You know, Mom and Dad...<br> ...you are the best parents<br> a girl could ever have.<br> I'm really gonna try and behave myself.<br> Sure you will!<br> Come on, Momma, sit down.<br> You want me to sit?<br> I mean, isn't this great?<br> Just all of us here together!<br> Can I tell Charlie<br> Peggy Sue got drunk last night?<br> Young lady!<br> I forgot about him. What am I gonna do?<br> - Did you two have a fight?<br> - Sort of.<br> - About what?<br> - House payments.<br> Baby!<br> How do you feel?<br> Pretty strange.<br> Come on. Get in. I can take care of that.<br> I have a headache.<br> Headache?<br> You drive like a maniac!<br> It's not that I'm glad you were sick...<br> ...but it just gave me a chance<br> to do some thinking last night.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah. About what we said on Tuesday.<br> I think it makes a lot of sense.<br> - Refresh my memory.<br> - How could you forget?<br> We talk about seeing other people<br> and you forget.<br> I must have blocked it out.<br> Yeah. I guess I can understand that.<br> But, please, don't start crying again.<br> It's not gonna be forever.<br> I figure three years is long enough<br> for the music to pan out, which it will.<br> I know it.<br> So right after graduation we should...<br> ...one: Start to see other people<br> so that we can...<br> ...two: We can comparison-shop.<br> And then, three:<br> Settle down and get married.<br> Why wait? Why not break up now?<br> Because we got the prom coming up<br> and all these parties.<br> - We don't want to upset our parents.<br> - They'll learn to live with it.<br> Peggy Sue!<br> Peggy Sue, come here.<br> Peggy Sue.<br> Did you study for the test?<br> - Test? There's a test?<br> - Yeah.<br> All right, class. Time's up.<br> And what's the meaning of this,<br> Peggy Sue?<br> Mr. Snelgrove...<br> ...I happen to know that in the future<br> I will have no use for algebra.<br> And I speak from experience.<br> - Who said that?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Sit down!<br> The result of his struggle is<br> that Santiago comes back with honour.<br> Santiago comes back with nothing!<br> There's no meat on the bone.<br> It's Hemingway's ego<br> trying to defend itself again.<br> Trying to prove he can still perform.<br> What Hemingway's saying, Michael,<br> is that we are alone.<br> That when we go out too far,<br> we're vulnerable.<br> The irony that Santiago<br> is beaten by the sharks...<br> ...doesn't make him less of a hero.<br> Who is the victim and who is the predator?<br> We'll finish this discussion next week.<br> And don't forget, first four chapters<br> of The Great Gatsby by Monday.<br> Hope you enjoy it.<br> Why does your father take inventory<br> on Sunday nights?<br> Hi, Peggy.<br> It's poker night.<br> You always got out of it before.<br> I just gotta string him along for a while.<br> It's for his own good.<br> You're not going into his business.<br> When are you gonna tell him?<br> Soon.<br> Walter!<br> I can't tell everybody everything<br> all at once.<br> Strange rumours<br> are sweeping the school about you.<br> Hi, Peggy.<br> What do you mean?<br> - I hear you gave it to old Smellygrove.<br> - I was there! She told him off to his face!<br> Attagirl, Peg!<br> Arthur, please don't call me Peg.<br> "Why, I oughta..."<br> I don't get it.<br> That's 'cause you're not<br> a total moron like they are.<br> It's a stupid movie thing they started.<br> That's enough outta you, little lady!<br> "Why, I oughta..."<br> I'll be right back.<br> Hi, Richard.<br> I wanted to congratulate you<br> on winning the math contest.<br> It really wasn't that difficult.<br> What are you doing?<br> You fishing for four-eyed worms?<br> Get lost, you macho schmuck!<br> I wanted to talk to you.<br> It's really important.<br> I'm not doing any tutoring this year.<br> I'm too busy.<br> No, it's not about that.<br> Would you meet me after school, please?<br> All right. I'll be in the physics lab.<br> Make it 4:30.<br> I have to go to a Rocket Club meeting.<br> Sure.<br> She's not wasting any time.<br> - Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root.<br> - He's a nice guy. He's writing a book.<br> A book? Excuse me for a second.<br> Why is she punishing herself?<br> Come on, Peggy Sue. Try it again.<br> You haven't been practising.<br> Sorry.<br> What a girl, what a twirl.<br> Peg "Leggy" Sue Kelcher.<br> A brief but glorious career as a majorette.<br> Baby!<br> Looking good out there!<br> Thanks.<br> I love it when you twirl your baton.<br> I noticed you were giving me<br> the silent treatment at lunch.<br> I guess I deserved it.<br> I've been thinking<br> about my three-year plan.<br> I think it's totally unworkable.<br> I must have been delirious.<br> I don't know.<br> I thought it made some sense.<br> Well, in the abstract, maybe.<br> Get a good grip on yourself.<br> When I think about you going out<br> with other guys, I feel...<br> Rejected? Worthless? Miserable?<br> Yeah.<br> Good.<br> Boy, that's some kite!<br> I'm writing a book on kite construction.<br> So what do you wanna talk about?<br> I just wanted to ask you a question.<br> Do you think time travel is possible?<br> - Are you doing a science project?<br> - Sort of.<br> Well, that's a very interesting question.<br> Well, now, let's see.<br> If we look at this<br> in a Newtonian framework...<br> ...the possibilities of time travel<br> were limited.<br> With the advent of the relativity theory,<br> that's Einstein's relativity theory...<br> ...the idea of absolute time<br> cannot be reasonably affirmed.<br> Well, then we have Richard's burrito.<br> What's that?<br> That's my own theory,<br> based on a Mexican food called the burrito.<br> - I had one at Disneyland.<br> - I know what a burrito is!<br> You see, I think that time is like a burrito...<br> ...in the sense that one part of itself<br> will fold over...<br> ...and it will just touch the other part.<br> - What's inside?<br> - You can fill it with whatever you want.<br> You can fill it with memories,<br> with experiences, trigonometry. Anything.<br> Then you think<br> that time travel is possible for people?<br> Yes, it is. It is possible.<br> It's absolutely possible for people,<br> dogs, elephants, cancan girls.<br> Then I'm not crazy!<br> I really don't know if you're crazy.<br> I know most people think I am.<br> - Come here, Richard.<br> - What?<br> - Come on.<br> - What are you doing?<br> Wait a minute, what are you...<br> Now, I want to tell you something.<br> You have to promise not to tell anyone!<br> - Okay. I won't.<br> - No, I'm serious. No one else can know.<br> I won't.<br> I promise, I'm not gonna tell anybody.<br> I have come here from the future,<br> from 25 years ahead.<br> I think that you're probably crazy.<br> I don't have time for this.<br> I don't have time for jokes.<br> - I know what you people think about me.<br> - No!<br> And I don't appreciate it!<br> You're just the smartest guy I knew to ask.<br> I know it sounds unbelievable,<br> but I can prove it.<br> Well, proof is an excellent concept. How?<br> You have a blind grandfather.<br> You're gonna invent this machine<br> that reads books for the blind.<br> You're gonna invent a lot of things.<br> You're gonna be really famous.<br> Wait a minute.<br> How did you know about my grandfather?<br> Because I'm telling you the truth.<br> I read about your invention in a magazine.<br> I know a lot of things<br> that are gonna happen.<br> There's gonna be test-tube babies<br> and heart transplants.<br> An American...<br> ...named Neil Armstrong<br> will be the first man to walk on the moon.<br> July 20, 1969.<br> That's six years ahead of schedule.<br> I would be very careful about this<br> if I were you.<br> What if you fall into the hands<br> of some madman...<br> ...with plans to manipulate your brain?<br> - Well, that's why I was getting a divorce.<br> You know what I really think happened?<br> I think I had a heart attack<br> at the reunion and died.<br> - You look great for a corpse.<br> - I'm serious.<br> - You're giving me the creeps.<br> - Well, am I dead or not?<br> There's one way to find out.<br> - Give me this.<br> - What are you doing?<br> Confucians say, "If you want a way out,<br> go through a door."<br> There's a fire truck.<br> If you're dead, it'll pass right through you.<br> Now just stay there. You're dead.<br> Young lady!<br> No, I don't wanna die!<br> It's all right.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> I had it made into a cocktail ring, though.<br> This is good.<br> Well, there's not a whole heck<br> of a lot here.<br> - Very nice pieces.<br> - So, thank you.<br> I'll take them to the shop<br> and have the appraisal ready next week.<br> - Good day, Mrs. Kelcher.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Who was that man?<br> - That was nobody, Peggy.<br> I'm voting for the Democrats this year.<br> You know how your father feels<br> about Democrats.<br> That was a polltaker.<br> I wouldn't mention it, if I were you.<br> How was school today, darling?<br> It was nice to see everybody again.<br> I don't know.<br> Everything they teach is so useless.<br> And the lunch! God, that was the worst!<br> Get that, Peggy.<br> - Hello?<br> - Peggy Sue? This is Grandma.<br> - Grandma?<br> - How's my little girl been?<br> - Grandpa and I are very concerned.<br> - What's the matter?<br> What's up?<br> - It's Grandma. I can't talk. I'm sorry.<br> - What's wrong?<br> Mom, I'll call you back. It's Peggy.<br> It's okay. I'll call you back.<br> Peggy Sue, what is it?<br> What happened to you just now?<br> What is this all about?<br> I dreamed that Grandma died.<br> Oh, baby. No wonder you're so upset.<br> She's getting on, it's true, but she's fine.<br> I told her<br> you weren't feeling well yesterday.<br> She called to find out how you are.<br> I love her so much<br> and I haven't seen her in so long.<br> - Grandpa Barney, is he all right?<br> - He's perfectly fine.<br> You saw them at Easter.<br> What's this all about, Peggy?<br> I don't know. I forgot.<br> - I'll call her tomorrow. I'll apologise.<br> - Good girl. I hate to see you so upset.<br> You're my angel.<br> Peggy, I don't mean to be intrusive.<br> But are you having problems with Charlie?<br> You mentioned something this morning.<br> A lot of things are confusing right now.<br> Charlie's just one of them.<br> Is Charlie pressuring you to do things<br> you don't think you should be doing?<br> What do you mean?<br> Peggy, you know what a penis is.<br> Stay away from it.<br> You're the best.<br> Make her love me, okay?<br> Feed me. Charge me.<br> Go get her, tiger.<br> Get the door, Jack!<br> Just a moment!<br> Hello, Charlie.<br> - Hello, Mr. Kelcher.<br> - Come on in.<br> - How are things at the hat store?<br> - Very good.<br> Charlie, could I have a word with you?<br> - Something wrong, sir?<br> - No, not a thing.<br> I'd just like to talk to you.<br> Hi, Mrs. Kelcher!<br> - How do you do today?<br> - Good.<br> - You look wonderful. Snap, crackle, pop.<br> - They're delicious.<br> Sit down, Charlie.<br> Nancy.<br> That sounded really great, Nancy.<br> Charlie, you may have noticed that...<br> ...Peggy Sue has been acting<br> a little bit strange lately?<br> - Indeed.<br> - She's distorted!<br> Nancy, please.<br> She seems to be<br> a little bit nervous and confused.<br> Over-emotional and even a little bit<br> irresponsible at times.<br> Of course, her mother says,<br> "That's the way girls act sometimes."<br> She's almost a juvenile delinquent.<br> - No!<br> - Out!<br> "Why, I oughta..."<br> Oh, God!<br> Yes, sir, but I think that's what I like<br> about Peggy, Mr. Kelcher.<br> She's not like all the other girls at school.<br> Charlie, in spite of your adolescent<br> infatuation with music...<br> ...we've always regarded you<br> as a very fine young man.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - And we've trusted you with our daughter.<br> Well, trust is a two-way street.<br> In the past two years...<br> ...l've been pleased to note<br> that you and Mrs. Kelcher...<br> ...have provided your sacred trust<br> with upbringing the woman...<br> ...that I plan to take off your hands.<br> Charlie's downstairs.<br> Why aren't you ready?<br> - For what?<br> - For Maddy's party, that's for what!<br> Mom, I don't feel like going to a party.<br> Feel or not feel, you accepted the invite.<br> Maddy's one of your best friends.<br> I baked the Rice Krispie squares.<br> You're supposed to be doing<br> your homework.<br> I need to talk to your sister.<br> Baby.<br> Try and enjoy yourself.<br> This is the best time of your whole life.<br> The sooner you learn to handle Charlie,<br> the better.<br> Stand up to Charlie.<br> Be a good girl.<br> Wear something cheerful. Perky.<br> We think this party might cheer her up.<br> As long as you understand<br> what's expected of you.<br> What would that be?<br> Show her a good time,<br> but for heaven's sake, restrain yourself!<br> Of course!<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Charlie?<br> Your sweater!<br> - It's great, isn't it?<br> - It's really '50s!<br> It's like you clash with the whole world.<br> What's the fun of being a teenager<br> if you can't dress weird?<br> - Good night, Dad.<br> - Good night!<br> - Good night, Mom.<br> - Be good, dear.<br> - Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Kelcher.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Have a good time, youngsters!<br> Nancy.<br> You look really beautiful.<br> Thank you.<br> - I cleaned the car. Do you like it?<br> - Yeah, looks better at night.<br> I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday.<br> You like him, right? Yeah, he's cool.<br> I was thinking of four ushers<br> and four bridesmaids.<br> The Yankees have the pitching,<br> but the White Sox have defence.<br> What will your colours be?<br> Kubek and Richardson any day<br> over Fox and Aparicio.<br> Pink and green.<br> - Look, Carol!<br> - What?<br> Look at Delores. What a tramp.<br> My God!<br> I think that pitching wins pennants.<br> The Tigers have got four<br> twenty-game potential winners.<br> You'd be surprised<br> at how many girls in school aren't virgins.<br> Like who?<br> Don Mossi, Frank Lary,<br> Jim Bunning and Paul Foytack.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello!<br> And now, direct from four weeks<br> of rehearsal in Walter's garage...<br> ...four guys who have prided themselves<br> on becoming the best group in the world.<br> Walter, Leon, Terry and Charlie,<br> The Definitions!<br> Charlie can really sing!<br> Maybe they'll be<br> the next Dion and the Belmonts!<br> I wouldn't count on it.<br> Come on! Where's your enthusiasm?<br> He really is kind of cute, isn't he?<br> Yeah!<br> He really loves you, too. You're so lucky!<br> He's always telling Walter<br> how wonderful you are.<br> - He is?<br> - Yeah!<br> Carol and I saw you<br> with that creep Richard Norvik today.<br> First of all, he's not a creep.<br> He's exceptional.<br> You'd know that if you took any time.<br> You just pity him since he has no friends.<br> If you weren't so neurotic and insecure...<br> ...maybe you could shut up<br> and show some compassion.<br> Are you for real?<br> I don't know what you said to her,<br> but I wish I'd said it.<br> Hi, fellas.<br> Walter!<br> - What do you think about Richard Norvik?<br> - He's a nice guy.<br> Is he going to help you<br> with all that physics stuff?<br> He's trying.<br> Who needs physics<br> when we've got chemistry?<br> Put on some make-out music<br> and turn out the lights!<br> There's not a girl in school<br> that can hold a candle to you.<br> You're pretty charming<br> when you want to be.<br> I know. But I don't have to flatter you.<br> It just feels right.<br> You're the perfect girl for me...<br> ...as in: Is, was...<br> ...and always will be.<br> I'm glad dancing was invented.<br> You know, the first dances were rituals.<br> Like fertility rites.<br> I always loved the way you kissed.<br> I missed you.<br> Your eyes look like silver pools<br> of moonlight.<br> And the tide rushes in.<br> You really love me, don't you?<br> You know I do.<br> I even wrote you into my will.<br> Charlie, let's make love.<br> What? You mean sex?<br> Intercourse.<br> You want to have intercourse?<br> Last weekend you said... What time is it?<br> Holy cow, it's late!<br> A lot of things have happened<br> since last weekend.<br> You were the one who said we should wait<br> and you were right.<br> We should wait till we get married.<br> I know I must have believed that...<br> ...when I said it, but...<br> ...doesn't Lucky Chucky want to come out?<br> - Who?<br> You know, your love machine.<br> Your throbbing thrill hammer. Your thing.<br> You mean my wang?<br> Listen, it's running real late!<br> Come on! What is this?<br> What the hell is going on, Peggy Sue?<br> One week you say,<br> "If you love me, you won't."<br> The next week you say,<br> "If you love me, you will."<br> That's a guy's line!<br> Forget about it. I made a mistake.<br> You're damn right!<br> Jesus, Peggy,<br> you sure know how to spoil a mood.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Save it, woman! Humiliator!<br> I was very impressed with what you said<br> in English class today.<br> Gilford's okay, except that he thinks<br> that Hemingway's great literature.<br> And you don't?<br> He's a fisherman.<br> The most overrated writer of the century.<br> I mean, man,<br> he is the perfect American author:<br> Fat, violent, drunk.<br> Maybe you're confusing his life<br> with his work.<br> A writer's life is his work.<br> Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull<br> to have something to write about!<br> I mean, man, he's out there burning,<br> feeling, grooving on life!<br> "The young man leaned back in his chair.<br> "No bulls would die today."<br> What are you doing here, anyway?<br> Coffee, donuts.<br> I thought chicks like you travelled in packs.<br> Man, I'm a hip chick.<br> - Come on, Delores.<br> - Terry, slow down!<br> What?<br> Look, there's Peggy Sue<br> with Michael Fitzsimmons!<br> - That Commie beatnik?<br> - First a geek and now a weirdo!<br> This is great.<br> This is great reefer.<br> It must belong to Beth.<br> I found it in my dress. It's really old.<br> It travels well.<br> Well, the world sure looks better up here.<br> The world is fantastic.<br> It's the ultimate absurd circus.<br> And I am shot from a cannon<br> into the energy.<br> What are you shooting for?<br> Maximum intensity.<br> I'm going to get out of here.<br> I'm going to write.<br> I'm checking out of this bourgeois motel.<br> Push myself away from the dinner table<br> and say:<br> "No more Jell-O for me, Mom!"<br> Don't you get along with your parents?<br> All my father digs is money.<br> All my mother cares about<br> is her standing at the country club.<br> Come on! They care about you.<br> - They're just a different generation.<br> - What's with you?<br> I thought you were cool.<br> You rode my bike. You blew some pot.<br> What's your scene, Miss Majorette?<br> You going to marry Mr. Blue lmpala...<br> ...and graze around with the other sheep<br> for the rest of your life?<br> No. I already did that.<br> I want to be a dancer.<br> That's what I want to do.<br> I'm going to dance and dance.<br> Come here.<br> You know, I had you pegged all wrong.<br> "Ray of oneness piercing the solitude<br> "Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh"<br> Is that one of your poems?<br> No, I just made that up.<br> - Do you want to hear one?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's called Tenderness.<br> "I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream<br> "Betrayed by a kiss<br> Sucking pods of bitterness<br> "In the madhouse of Doctor Dread<br> Razor shreds of rat puke<br> "Fall on my bare arms"<br> I'm sorry. I was trying to impress you.<br> Michael. You're as good as you looked.<br> "How many loved your moments<br> of glad grace<br> "And loved your beauty<br> with love false or true<br> "But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you<br> "And loved the sorrows<br> of your changing face"<br> I didn't write that. That's Yeats.<br> I envy you.<br> You have your whole life ahead of you<br> and you know exactly what you want.<br> But no more rat puke, okay?<br> Try and write something beautiful.<br> I'll respect you for eternity.<br> You know, this really isn't happening.<br> - And one Shostakovich.<br> - Shostakovich?<br> Charlie, I'm just taking Ravel!<br> Listen. Take the Shostakovich home.<br> Listen to it. Let it grow on you.<br> If you don't like it<br> I will give you your money back.<br> I did like the Dvorak one you suggested.<br> I liked that a lot.<br> And, young man, you talked me into it.<br> It's the most definitive Dvorak!<br> You'll like it. I kid you not.<br> - What do you know about classical music?<br> - Nothing. But selling is selling.<br> Charlie, about last night...<br> Hush, baby, hush. I've been thinking.<br> Girls must go through that stuff, too.<br> Sometimes when I look at you<br> I feel like an animal.<br> I don't know. Maybe my dad's right.<br> Teenagers are nuts.<br> But I'm not.<br> I'm a grown woman with a lifetime<br> of experiences you can't understand.<br> Girls mature faster than guys.<br> But last night,<br> I was the one who put on the brakes.<br> - And do you know why?<br> - Why?<br> Because nothing else matters.<br> That's the great thing about love.<br> Every time we argue...<br> ...every time something goes wrong,<br> and I know I'm not perfect either...<br> ...things just work out better in the end.<br> Because you're my baby. And I love you.<br> Charlie, what am I going to do with you?<br> Boy! Just cherish me.<br> You have an opportunity<br> to be the richest woman in the world...<br> ...and I'm going to be your partner.<br> I'll tell you where the fortune is:<br> Running shoes...<br> ...tennis and jogging shoes,<br> all that kind of stuff.<br> I mean, I'm talking $50, $100, $200 a pair.<br> - Wait, you got to be kidding.<br> - No!<br> You're talking about exercise stuff?<br> Like gym stuff?<br> Not your style.<br> These are the choices, okay?<br> Microwave ovens, pocket calculators...<br> ...Walkmans, digital watches...<br> ...and miniature television sets.<br> And huge radios.<br> For some reason everything else gets tiny,<br> but portable radios get enormous.<br> Huge, enormous radios?<br> - Portable enormous radios.<br> - Wait a minute, I got an idea. Come on!<br> - What?<br> - Come on!<br> Come here!<br> Here.<br> - Excuse me, miss.<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you have pantyhose?<br> - I'm sorry, what?<br> Pantyhose. You know...<br> "Pantyhose"?<br> Why, Richard!<br> This is lingerie.<br> Mrs. Woodhouse, I am studying the fabric<br> for the aerodynamic principles for kites.<br> They don't have it!<br> They've never heard of it.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> - What?<br> - I'm talking about the wave of the future.<br> I've decided on our first fortune.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - Okay.<br> You just keep thinking high tech.<br> "High tech"? That's nice.<br> I like the sound of that. High tech.<br> - All right, what is the scoop?<br> - What?<br> How come we're your friends<br> and we find out about...<br> ...you and Michael Fitzsimmons<br> from Delores?<br> Who needs satellites<br> when I've got Delores' mouth?<br> I hear she does more than talk<br> with her mouth.<br> That's disgusting!<br> Maddy, would you grow up?<br> It says in Love Without Fear<br> the tongue kiss is a means...<br> ...of genital stimulation, is widely practised<br> and has much to commend it!<br> Did you memorise the book<br> or just the good parts?<br> No. Just what you underlined.<br> You did!<br> You know, Carol, you have great hair.<br> Peggy Sue, come on!<br> What's with you and Michael?<br> Yeah, come on!<br> He's so cool and mysterious.<br> Well, he's interesting.<br> Underneath that rough exterior<br> lurks the heart of a true poet.<br> A poet?<br> I bet Delores told Charlie!<br> - That loudmouthed little bitch!<br> - Peggy Sue!<br> Watch out for her, Peggy Sue.<br> She's after Charlie.<br> Just cool it, girls.<br> Charlie's free to go out<br> with whoever he wants to.<br> What?<br> But I always thought<br> you were going to marry Charlie.<br> Carol would marry Walter<br> and I'd marry Arthur.<br> We'd all live on the same street and...<br> ...take our kids to the park together<br> and have barbecues every Sunday.<br> It's going to spoil everything<br> if you and Charlie break up.<br> That Michael Fitzsimmons<br> doesn't look like the barbecue type.<br> Come on! I just had one date with him.<br> I'm not going to marry him!<br> You promise?<br> Come on, let's go to the movies.<br> Peggy Sue, I mean, don't be silly.<br> It's Saturday night. It's date night.<br> I got to go. Arthur's picking me up soon.<br> Wait a minute. No, I mean just the girls.<br> Like a slumber party.<br> - Aren't we too old for that?<br> - Sometimes you're so immature.<br> Well, we...<br> 'Bye!<br> I'm immature?<br> Charlie? Charlie, I had such a dream.<br> Peggy Sue, I have to talk to you.<br> Charlie, what are you doing here?<br> Let's go down to the basement.<br> Okay.<br> I want to know what's going on.<br> Delores told me about you<br> and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons.<br> When you dropped me off last night<br> I didn't feel like going to bed.<br> - And I ran into Michael and went for a ride.<br> - Then it's true, damn it!<br> I had a miserable time tonight<br> because of you.<br> When the Monotones did Book of Love:<br> "Chapter four, you break up<br> Won't you give it one more chance?"<br> I'm thinking, "Did we break up?"<br> Did we break up?<br> Because if we did<br> I don't even know about it.<br> Did that Maynard G. Beatnik<br> give you what you wanted?<br> You know, I hate your sarcasm.<br> You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue.<br> No one treats Charlie Bodell like this.<br> Why do you talk about yourself in the third<br> person like you were Napoleon?<br> - Why is everything an argument with you?<br> - Look! I've got the hair.<br> I've got the teeth. I've got the eyes.<br> Peggy, look outside that window.<br> I've got the car. I'm the lead singer.<br> I'm the man.<br> Why are you arguing with me?<br> It's over, Charlie. I don't want to hurt you.<br> I want you to be happy.<br> But, no. I will be happy if I have you.<br> I love you.<br> No! That doesn't make any difference.<br> We just can't live together.<br> And you went off with that bimbo Janet.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Who is Janet?<br> - I don't know any Janet.<br> - I just can't trust you!<br> But what about everything<br> I said to you this afternoon?<br> That's exactly what I'm talking about.<br> I have this window in my heart<br> and anytime you want, you can crawl in.<br> I got to close it<br> or nothing's going to be different.<br> - What has to be different?<br> - Everything!<br> You know it's not going to work like this.<br> You have to go to college and finish.<br> What about the group<br> and my singing career?<br> What about me?<br> I am trying to save you years of frustration<br> of waiting for...<br> ...that big break. No.<br> That big disappointment so you can<br> blame me for the rest of your life.<br> You don't know zip.<br> You think I'm going to spend<br> the rest of my life selling appliances?<br> Chasing women around the store<br> like my father?<br> I've got to give it a shot.<br> What the hell has changed, Peggy Sue?<br> Until yesterday you loved me<br> and you loved us.<br> For two years,<br> I've done nothing but love you.<br> All right, I'll prove it to you. I'll show you.<br> I'm going to be just like Fabian.<br> Let's sit there.<br> Sure.<br> This is great.<br> Okay, here we go.<br> - Suds for you.<br> - Thank you.<br> And a whiskey for you.<br> Five more weeks of school.<br> Ten minutes past graduation, I'm gone!<br> To freedom!<br> For everyone.<br> Now, this is the plan.<br> As soon as school is finished,<br> we move to Utah.<br> Utah?<br> I thought you'd be going to Paris<br> or New York.<br> What's in Utah?<br> Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool.<br> You'll really dig her.<br> She's got this little cabin outside the hills<br> of Provo where she raises chickens.<br> I'll write, and you two can take care<br> of the chickens to support us.<br> - I can't do that.<br> - Why not?<br> Polygamy's legal in Utah.<br> I'm allergic to chickens.<br> Wait. What about the other night?<br> We were like two stars<br> in the same constellation.<br> Michael, you and I are light-years apart.<br> You should go, but not with me.<br> But we had heat, baby. Passion! Fire!<br> We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.<br> At least one more time.<br> That's a great line.<br> You are going to be a terrific writer.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yeah.<br> Michael,<br> we had one glorious night together.<br> Someday you'll remember<br> and write about it.<br> Yeah.<br> I can dig that.<br> Bittersweet perfection.<br> Dogs of lust on leashes of memory. Yes!<br> It's Charlie.<br> What a treat.<br> Now I get it.<br> It's great.<br> Peggy Sue's still stuck on<br> "Treble Without a Cause."<br> Come on, I want to dance.<br> I thought I knew everything about him.<br> Can we split now?<br> Thank you.<br> So, Mr. Wilkins, new client?<br> I'm sorry, Charlie.<br> I don't think so, you know.<br> It happens, but not with you.<br> Believe me when I tell you.<br> Maybe it's the material.<br> But it can't happen.<br> Good morning.<br> Charlie?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I wanted to talk to you.<br> I've got one last thing<br> I have to do at school and then...<br> Elvis. Hi. How are you? Hi, guy.<br> Elvis is dead. That's Ajax.<br> I guess I always liked Elvis.<br> - Can I have a ride to school?<br> - No.<br> - Why?<br> - The tiger's out of commission for a while.<br> Come on.<br> - How about a walk, Charlie Bell?<br> - How did you know about that?<br> I was at Lena's last night.<br> I heard you sing.<br> I thought you were terrific.<br> Not terrific enough.<br> What were you doing there?<br> - Who were you with?<br> - Well, what were you doing there?<br> You never told me you sang<br> with an R & B group.<br> There's not a whole heck of a lot<br> we know about each other, Peggy.<br> - I forgot how much music meant to you.<br> - That's real big of you.<br> Stop being so defensive. Here.<br> I wrote a song for you.<br> - Why did you write me a song?<br> - Because I want to help you.<br> - It'll be a hit. I promise.<br> - Come on! Stop being sarcastic.<br> Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night.<br> He told me to forget it.<br> Would you just take a look at it?<br> Come on. I wrote it for you.<br> Well, if you wrote it I guess I'll look at it.<br> Listen, about the other night,<br> I feel so stupid.<br> I'm beginning to think that maybe<br> there is more to life than just music.<br> Do you think the world would still like me<br> if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?<br> Yeah.<br> Do you want to walk to school?<br> Okay, I'll just put the dog inside.<br> Come on, Ajax.<br> What's the matter, princess?<br> Lost your prince?<br> Delores, there are a lot of things<br> I could say to you...<br> ...but you're just not worth the effort.<br> - I'm so sorry. These pens are so tricky, I...<br> - You did that on purpose!<br> I hate you! Go stuff your bra!<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Take a long walk on a short pier.<br> Have a nice day.<br> You know, Peggy, there are so many things<br> to look forward to in the future.<br> I came to say good-bye, Richard.<br> Good-bye? Wait a minute. Sit down.<br> Good-bye? Where are you going?<br> Peggy, we have a partnership here.<br> - I'm making progress on that microchip.<br> - Well, you were meant to.<br> You're one of the people<br> good things happen to.<br> So are you.<br> - You have a vision, Peggy.<br> - A vision?<br> I am a walking anachronism!<br> I've upset my parents. I miss my kids.<br> I could be trapped here forever.<br> And poor Charlie.<br> I got pregnant when I was 18.<br> That was why we had to get married.<br> Tomorrow's my birthday.<br> - I have to get out of here.<br> - You broke up with Charlie?<br> Yeah. I know it's a gamble.<br> I've loved him for a long, long time.<br> Okay. Then let's do something<br> really visionary.<br> Change your destiny, Peggy Sue.<br> Change your destiny and marry me.<br> No! Peggy Sue got married.<br> Case closed.<br> I don't want to marry anyone, Richard.<br> Good-bye.<br> Wait! Peggy, please. Can I go with you?<br> No! You have to be valedictorian.<br> Peggy Sue, wait a minute!<br> Listen, I cut shop<br> and I did some work on your song.<br> You know, it's not half bad<br> for your first try.<br> I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs,"<br> but listen to this:<br> "She loves you, ooh, ooh, ooh<br> You love me, ooh, ooh, ooh"<br> I got to go.<br> About your birthday.<br> I made reservations at Chez Trev.<br> I thought it would be great to eat<br> at a nice restaurant.<br> I won't be here.<br> - Why?<br> - I want to go see my grandparents.<br> Good-bye, Charlie.<br> I cancelled the tickets for Fabian.<br> Close that.<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> Look! Oh, it's so beautiful.<br> What's the matter, Peggy?<br> Someone jump on your grave?<br> You know, Peggy, your mother said<br> you had a dream that I died.<br> I wish she hadn't have told you that.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> I know exactly when I'm going to die.<br> What's it going to be, Lizzy?<br> Seventy-five or eighty?<br> I'm not telling!<br> I've been trying to drag<br> that out of her for years.<br> You know,<br> dreams are a fascinating business.<br> - Especially when you see the future.<br> - Do you believe all this?<br> Well, I like to speculate.<br> Like this book I'm reading right now.<br> It's about a woman in Colorado who says<br> she lived in Ireland 150 years ago.<br> She gives names,<br> dates and where she lived.<br> Grandma. Grandpa.<br> I want to tell you something.<br> If you believe it, darling, then I believe.<br> Being young is just as confusing<br> as being old.<br> The things that happened to me<br> ...are more on my mind<br> than the things that happen today.<br> But I'm remembering the future.<br> A chilling wind tonight.<br> It's really picking up.<br> Right now,<br> you're just browsing through time.<br> Choose the things you'll be proud of.<br> Things that last.<br> I'm proud of my children.<br> I miss them so much.<br> Scott and Beth.<br> I named my daughter after you.<br> Sweetheart, thank you.<br> Grandpa.<br> When you and Grandma are gone,<br> the family's gone.<br> And I'll never see the cousins anymore.<br> It's your grandma's strudel<br> that's kept this family together.<br> If you could do it all again, Grandpa,<br> what would you do different?<br> I'd have taken better care of my teeth.<br> Now what's Peggy Sue going to do<br> at your lodge meeting?<br> It's her 18th birthday<br> and I want to show her off.<br> It was my idea, Grandma.<br> I wondered about those lodge meetings.<br> He won't tell me.<br> But I have my suspicions.<br> I don't want to know.<br> Have a good time, darling.<br> All right.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye, darling.<br> Grandpa?<br> What does Grandma think you do<br> at these meetings?<br> Stag movies and poker.<br> I may be an old fool,<br> but I think I can help you.<br> At least I got to see you<br> and Grandma again.<br> Has this ever worked before?<br> The last time was 600 years ago.<br> And it's about time for another one.<br> Welcome, Peggy Sue!<br> Peggy Sue! Welcome, Peggy Sue!<br> - It's so wonderful to have you here with us.<br> - Thank you.<br> You've come to the right place.<br> Our lodge was founded by a time traveller.<br> - We're going to send you back home.<br> - That's right!<br> You know, this is very exciting for all of us.<br> You know, we've waited a long time<br> to find a girl like you.<br> Yes!<br> Grandpa! Do you have to wear that hat?<br> Wouldn't be a lodge without hats.<br> "Lord of the universe.<br> "Vast and mighty one.<br> "Ruler of light.<br> "King of the sun.<br> "This girl is lost amid your mysteries...<br> "...and wishes to return to her own time.<br> "We adore thee and invoke thee!<br> "Grant thine aid.<br> "Look with favour upon us<br> as we witness the regeneration of spirit.<br> "We ask thy intervention...<br> "...that this girl may return to thee<br> on the wings of thy love."<br> "Womb of the mother,<br> reclaim thy child of light."<br> "The name of your love is rebirth."<br> - This is never going to work.<br> - It's going to work!<br> "Reclaim thy child of light."<br> "We offer up this girl<br> that her soul may find its home."<br> It's nothing to worry about.<br> Somebody get the lights.<br> Somebody get the lights!<br> She's gone!<br> What the hell do you think you're doing?<br> I'm saving you!<br> They were going to vaporise you!<br> Don't be ridiculous! They're harmless<br> old men! My grandfather was in there!<br> - Get in the car!<br> - I'm not getting in this monstrosity!<br> Well, the girl's gone.<br> Let's play cards.<br> I've got good news.<br> Now sit down right here.<br> You've got two minutes!<br> I told my father<br> that I'm going to quit singing.<br> And he gave me 10 percent<br> of the business right now!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I know what you've been going through.<br> You were just scared.<br> But you don't have to be scared anymore.<br> I can support you now.<br> - Shit!<br> - Peggy Sue?<br> Will you marry me?<br> How can you know<br> what I've been going through?<br> Of course I'm scared!<br> I can't change anything.<br> - I can't help anybody.<br> - You're not listening to me.<br> - I'm proposing to you now.<br> - You betrayed me.<br> You were never there for me<br> and the children.<br> I'll be there for the children.<br> I'll forget Walter.<br> Forget the group. I want to marry you!<br> Don't be crazy.<br> I may be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough<br> to marry you twice.<br> Christ.<br> Peggy.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought I was what you wanted me to be.<br> It's all my fault.<br> Here.<br> It's a birthday present.<br> I'm tired of being the romantic fool.<br> I'm going to go save my car.<br> Charlie?<br> It opens, too.<br> Look inside.<br> Scott and Beth. Where did you get this?<br> Who are Scott and Beth?<br> Your mother gave me those.<br> It's you and me.<br> You know that.<br> So are they.<br> I do love you.<br> I love you.<br> This is right, Peggy Sue.<br> I want this to be forever.<br> Mom, can you hear me?<br> Please, Mom, can you hear me?<br> They call what happened a near-death...<br> ...but we figured out<br> exactly what the problem is...<br> You are a very lucky young lady!<br> What happened to you, Peggy Sue,<br> was a very rare problem...<br> ...with the rhythm of your heart.<br> Mom, do you remember anything?<br> In fact, at the party,<br> they had to do CPR on you...<br> ...before the paramedics arrived<br> to give your heart a shock and restart it.<br> Dad's been here every day.<br> "'Cause I love you, Peggy Sue<br> "I love you, girl, and I need you, Peggy"<br> Charlie?<br> - Was I dead?<br> - I thought you were for a while.<br> You look awful.<br> You look like you haven't slept in days.<br> - You look so old.<br> - But happy.<br> Very happy, Peggy.<br> I thought I knew everything about you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I wanted to tell you that I...<br> - I wanted to...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I can't live without you.<br> What about Janet?<br> That's over.<br> I got tired of translating everything to her.<br> She thought the Big Bopper<br> was a hamburger.<br> - Who are all the flowers from?<br> - Everyone.<br> Maddy and Arthur, Carol and Walter...<br> ...Richard Norvik.<br> And here's a book by that guy<br> in high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.<br> He dedicated it to you.<br> It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.<br> I'll just set this right here.<br> I had a strange experience.<br> I went back to high school<br> and I spent a lot of time with you.<br> You and Walter and Leon were singing<br> I Wonder Why.<br> God! Dion!<br> You were terrific.<br> And I kept trying to push you away.<br> - But you wouldn't give up.<br> - I'll never give up.<br> Would you hold me?<br> I don't expect that all our problems<br> can just vanish.<br> Christ, I would cut my right arm off<br> for another chance.<br> No, please, I need some time.<br> Well, I'll let you get some rest.<br> I'd like to invite you over to our house<br> for dinner on Sunday.<br> With your kids.<br> I'll make a strudel.<br>
