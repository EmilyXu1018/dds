Hold on, Iris.<br> Excuse me, sir?<br> My sons and I went<br> to a restaurant the other day.<br> We ordered coffee.<br> The waiter goes...<br> "Would you like sugar<br> or Sweet 'n' Low?"<br> I said,<br> "Do I look like I should be on a diet?"<br> Oh, God,<br> sometimes I just feel so sorry...<br> - Andy.<br> - Hi, Doc.<br> Your blood work came back this morning.<br> I'm gonna come back in a few minutes<br> and talk to you about it.<br> - All right?<br> - I'll be right here.<br> Good.<br> How you doin' today, Jackie?<br> Hi. How're you feeling?<br> - Feelin' pretty good.<br> - Great.<br> Make a fist for me?<br> Once more.<br> Gonna have to start lookin' for veins<br> in your feet, sweetheart.<br> - Patience, Tyrone.<br> - Okay.<br> Once more.<br> - How are the Magruder accounts?<br> - We'll close in a couple weeks.<br> Terrific job on the Kendall situation.<br> - Top-notch, Mr. Beckett.<br> - Thanks, Kenneth, Robert.<br> - Hi, Mr. Beckett.<br> - Hi, Rose.<br> Anthea, just the paralegal<br> extraordinaire I was hoping to see.<br> I know what that means.<br> The answer is no.<br> - I'm talkin' dinner at Felicia's.<br> - I've got a class.<br> I've got some pretty compelling briefs<br> that need proofing.<br> You can exploit somebody else.<br> - Since you've asked...<br> - Your exam.<br> Thank you. Ninety-eight.<br> Ninety-eight? Congratulations.<br> I have to pick up Amy, but I want<br> to talk to you about that Hansen thing.<br> Give me a call. I'll be here. Tell Amy<br> I loved her painting. It's on my wall.<br> Hi, Andrew. Conference call's up.<br> The roll call just started.<br> Now, this is a settlement agreement.<br> The red-line copy's on your desk.<br> - You need me in there?<br> - No. It's 6:30. Go home.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hey, Mom!<br> Oh, hi, darling.<br> What a wonderful surprise. How are you?<br> Good.<br> Well, what does Dr. Gillman say?<br> Dr. Gillman says I am fine.<br> My blood work is excellent.<br> She says my T-cells are steady.<br> Honey, how 'bout your platelets?<br> What did she say?<br> Oh, even my platelets look good.<br> Great.<br> Mom, more importantly,<br> how are you?<br> Mom?<br> I'm fine.<br> - And Dad?<br> - Dad is fine.<br> And what are you doin'?<br> Okay.<br> "Action for the wrongful interference<br> with prospective economic relations."<br> Okay.<br> Am I interrupting you?<br> In a word, Bob...<br> Charles wants to see you upstairs.<br> I was just about to take a break.<br> - I'm not underdressed for this?<br> - No, you're not.<br> Charles, Andy has expressed<br> a keen interest...<br> in Highline, Inc. V. Sander Systems.<br> Isn't that right, Andy?<br> The fate of the participants<br> interests me. Yes, sir.<br> It's an antitrust action.<br> It is, and it isn't, Charles.<br> Sander Systems copies<br> Highline's spreadsheet program.<br> For me...<br> the legal principle involved is<br> copyright infringement.<br> Well, tell me this, Andy.<br> Which side of this conflict would you<br> wish to see emerge victorious?<br> And don't allow my close personal<br> relationship with Bill Wright...<br> Sander Systems' C.E.O. To influence<br> your answer in any way.<br> Well, I'd like to see Highline<br> win this one.<br> Oh! Why, Beckett?<br> If Sanders Systems wins...<br> an energetic,<br> young company is destroyed.<br> The laws for antitrust and copyright<br> were enacted to prevent exactly...<br> the kind of bullshit<br> that Sander Systems is trying to pull.<br> - Andy, you know who reps Highline?<br> - Rodney Bailey.<br> Oh, I object!<br> Rodney Bailey, who couldn't find his way<br> around copyright law with a map.<br> Well, apparently the fellas<br> at Highline agree with you, Andy.<br> Which explains why, as of 9:03<br> this evening, right after dessert...<br> Highline is now represented by Wyant,<br> Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown.<br> Outstanding.<br> And more specifically...<br> Senior Associate Andrew Beckett.<br> - Bravo!<br> - Yes!<br> - Come on!<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you, Robert.<br> - We've got to get on this right away.<br> Statute of limitations, yeah.<br> I'm right on it.<br> - Exactly.<br> - We have ten days to file.<br> Tokyo on line four, Bob.<br> Walter, thank you.<br> - Kenneth, thank you.<br> - You bet, Andy. Congratulations.<br> - Thanks. I'm overwhelmed.<br> - What's that on your forehead, pal?<br> What? Where?<br> That... right there on your forehead.<br> Oh, I got whacked in the head<br> with a racket ball.<br> Excuse me.<br> Charles, I...<br> I sincerely appreciate<br> your faith in my abilities.<br> Faith, Andy, is the belief in something<br> for which we have no evidence.<br> It does not apply to this situation.<br> Well, go home.<br> Oh, no! Go back to work.<br> Thank you, Charles.<br> No sweat, buddy.<br> The committee meeting we're gonna have<br> next week... a bunch of staff members...<br> Tommy, how are ya?<br> The Highline complaint is<br> right there on my desk, Shelby.<br> It's all set to go,<br> so make sure Jamey is on top of it.<br> Sure. You got it.<br> Anything else?<br> No, that's it. I'm gonna be working<br> out of the house this afternoon...<br> so, thanks a lot.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> Okay. Now, you're gonna want to apply<br> this foundation as evenly as you can.<br> 'Cause you don't want it to look<br> like you threw it on with a spoon.<br> - Yeah.<br> - So, over here, you try this.<br> - I got it.<br> - Right there.<br> Chandra, you don't think this is<br> just a little too orange for me?<br> Well, okay, it's Tahitian Bronze.<br> That works best on these lesions.<br> Think of it as the<br> "I just got back from Aruba" look.<br> Exactly. I've called in sick<br> for four days...<br> and now they're gonna think<br> I was taking a cruise.<br> - Fax.<br> - Oh, thank you, Bruno.<br> Okay, we can try this light Egypt...<br> What?<br> Excuse me.<br> Just like my cousin, Fredo.<br> Does anybody want a bagel?<br> You okay, Andy?<br> I think I need to go<br> to the hospital.<br> Watch out!<br> Hello, hello.<br> Oh, it's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> - I'm gettin' out of here, all right?<br> - Okay.<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> Oh, one more.<br> Thank you for driving<br> like a bat out of hell.<br> - Take it easy, all right?<br> - Dr. Gillman is out of her office.<br> I told her to take a day off, and she<br> took a day off. Can you believe that?<br> They took blood?<br> A specimen or something?<br> Blood, yes. A specimen, I'm empty.<br> Did you find someone to take your class?<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Let me see.<br> Oh, you got a fever, baby.<br> Oh, there's my guy.<br> Excuse me.<br> Doctor? Hello, hi.<br> Just one second.<br> I came that close to not making it<br> to the bathroom again.<br> - I almost lost it in front of everyone.<br> - So what?<br> - It's nothing to be ashamed of.<br> - I'm not ashamed, it's just...<br> - What about my blood work?<br> - We're waiting.<br> Meanwhile, I want to prep you<br> for a colonoscopy, take a look inside.<br> - It sounds delightful.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Why do you need to do this?<br> - Who are you?<br> - Who are you, Dr...<br> - This is my partner.<br> - Yeah?<br> He keeps the records of all my hospital<br> visits. It's nothing personal.<br> Oh, I'm Dr. Klenstein.<br> Listen, you're right. A colonoscopy<br> is not a pleasant procedure.<br> But if the K.S. Is causing the diarrhea,<br> we've got to know about that right away.<br> No, but it could be parasites,<br> an infection. I mean...<br> Reaction to the A.Z.T.<br> All these are possibilities,<br> but we've got to go forward...<br> Listen to me. He's not going through<br> some painful procedure...<br> until we cancel out everything else,<br> understand?<br> - I'm trying to help your partner, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> - You're not immediate family.<br> - I'm not?<br> - I could have you removed from the E.R.<br> - Really?<br> Look, he's upset. He's sorry.<br> No. Don't apologize for me, okay?<br> Okay. He's not sorry.<br> Let's do this.<br> Let's find out<br> what the blood work tells us.<br> I'll try to give you a specimen.<br> Some hospital food may help me along.<br> Then we might hear from Dr. Gillman.<br> We can start from there, okay?<br> - Everybody happy? All right?<br> - Okay.<br> - I'll see the lab about the blood work.<br> - Thank you, Doctor.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's the third time<br> the office has beeped me.<br> - I better go.<br> - "Klenstein"?<br> I gotta go give them a call.<br> Now, I want you to sit down and relax.<br> - I am relaxed.<br> - Oh, good.<br> Is there a phone around,<br> somewhere nearby?<br> - Down the hall.<br> - Thank you.<br> If you or someone you know has been<br> injured through the fault of others...<br> you may be entitled<br> to a cash settlement...<br> or money damages<br> for your pain and suffering.<br> - Good Lord.<br> - I'm attorneyJoseph Miller.<br> At McCreedy and...<br> Mr. Beckett's office.<br> Shelby, it's me.<br> Jamey's been beepin' me.<br> I'm so glad you called, Andrew.<br> Listen, I just want you to know we have<br> a minor catastrophe in the making here.<br> It's about that Highline complaint.<br> Jamey is going absolutely ballistic.<br> All right. Calm down.<br> Put him on.<br> All right. One second.<br> Andy, this is a disaster! We can't find<br> the revisions on the Highline complaint.<br> Wait, wait. Slow down.<br> I told them you were working at home,<br> and it would be here this morning.<br> No. I brought it into the office<br> last night.<br> I was there till 3:00 a.m. There should<br> be a copy with corrections on my desk.<br> I'm telling you it's not here, Andy.<br> Shelby can't find it either.<br> All right.<br> The hard disk on my computer.<br> Print it up on the double and run it<br> through word processing yourself.<br> - Okay. What did you file it under?<br> - H- L-1.<br> Jamey, I don't have to tell you we are<br> up against the statute of limitations...<br> and it runs out in...<br> in 75 minutes?<br> - It's not here, Andy.<br> - Not there? I'm on my way.<br> Every problem has a solution.<br> Aw, it's coming.<br> Yeah, baby, it's coming!<br> It's a girl.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Take a picture, Joe.<br> - I'm trying. I can't get the film in.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Baby? Help me, baby.<br> Aw, look at her.<br> - That little, sweet little...<br> - Get a picture before she gets too old.<br> She's perfect, Lisa.<br> Long hair.<br> Go down to Famous Fourth Street Deli,<br> and get a pound of Nova...<br> No... Scotch salmon.<br> She likes that.<br> Yeah. Some onion rolls, bagels...<br> Here, give me a call.<br> - Nice champagne.<br> - You're that TV guy.<br> I don't care how much it costs.<br> Get some nice Dom Perignon.<br> - Thanks.<br> - How much?<br> A hundred dollars? Don't get<br> Dom Perignon. Get a nice Californian.<br> Dom Perignon's too much. Get it all<br> over here, because she's starving.<br> No, Iris, not the baby.<br> Lisa is starving.<br> Yeah, Lisa.<br> Iris, listen.<br> - Anybody call?<br> - An Andrew Beckett called.<br> Beckett? Who's Andrew Beckett?<br> There he is! Joseph!<br> The entire street is clear, except for<br> one small area under construction:<br> This huge hole that is<br> clearly marked and blocked off.<br> - Yes.<br> - You decide to cross at this spot.<br> You fall into the hole. Now you want<br> to sue the city for negligence, right?<br> Yes. Do I have a case?<br> - Yes. Of course you've got a case.<br> - Great.<br> - Go with my assistant Iris.<br> - All right.<br> She'll have you fill out some forms,<br> tell you about our fee arrangement.<br> Of course, you know we take no cash<br> unless we get cash justice for you.<br> How's your back? You got any<br> lower back pain, dizziness, nightmares?<br> Funny you should mention that.<br> I been having...<br> Iris will take good care of you.<br> Iris, you take good care of Mr. Finley.<br> - I will. Mr. Beckett's here.<br> - Hey, thanks a lot.<br> Take care. Mr. Beckett?<br> Mr. Beckett, come in.<br> It's good to see you again,<br> Counselor.<br> Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.<br> "Innocuous."<br> How are you?<br> What happened to your face?<br> I have AIDS.<br> I'm sorry. I, uh...<br> - Can I sit down?<br> - Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, look at this.<br> You have a new baby.<br> Yeah.<br> I got a little baby girl.<br> "It's a girl."<br> Congratulations.<br> Yeah. One week old.<br> Kids are great.<br> Yeah. Thank you, Beckett.<br> I'm real excited about it. Listen, I...<br> What can I do for you?<br> I've been fired by Wyant, Wheeler.<br> I want to bring a wrongful termination<br> suit against Wheeler and his partners.<br> You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,<br> Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?<br> Correct.<br> I'm seeking representation.<br> Continue.<br> I misplaced an important complaint.<br> That's their story.<br> Want to hear mine?<br> How many lawyers did you go to<br> before you called me?<br> Nine.<br> Continue.<br> The night before it was due,<br> I worked on the complaint in my office.<br> I left a copy of it on my desk.<br> The next day,<br> the complaint vanished.<br> No hard copy.<br> All traces of it<br> mysteriously gone from my computer.<br> Miraculously, a copy of the complaint<br> was located at the last minute...<br> and we got it to court on time.<br> But the next day I was summoned<br> to a meeting with the managing partners.<br> They were waiting for me<br> in the conference room.<br> Oh, hello, Andy!<br> Come on in.<br> Would you mind hitting the windows?<br> Thanks. Come on in.<br> Kenneth, Robert, Charles,<br> Walter and Lydia.<br> Thanks for coming in.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Andy, before we begin,<br> I'd just like to say...<br> that everyone in this room<br> is your friend.<br> I know that, Charles.<br> More than your friend...<br> family.<br> Charles, I must apologize again<br> for the Highline mishap yesterday.<br> That was some scary moment<br> around here.<br> Wow. Thank God<br> the complaint was found...<br> and no damage was done.<br> This time.<br> What about next time?<br> There won't be a next time.<br> I guarantee it.<br> Yeah. It's just that something's<br> come over you lately, Andy.<br> I don't know...<br> some kind of stupor or fogginess.<br> Some people think you have<br> an attitude problem, Beckett.<br> Really?<br> Who thinks that?<br> I do.<br> Excuse me.<br> Am I being fired?<br> Let me put it this way, Andy.<br> Your place in the future<br> of this firm is no longer secure.<br> We feel it isn't fair<br> to keep you here...<br> when your prospects are limited.<br> And now,<br> I don't want to rush you out...<br> We've got a committee meeting.<br> Excuse me, Charles...<br> with all due respect,<br> this is preposterous!<br> It doesn't make any sense.<br> Oh, you're right, Beckett.<br> You don't have an attitude problem.<br> Take it easy.<br> If you'd lost confidence in me,<br> why did you give me the Highline suit?<br> Andy, you nearly blew the entire case.<br> That alone is inexcusable.<br> It would have been<br> catastrophic for us.<br> So you were<br> concealing your illness.<br> That's correct.<br> All right. Explain this to me<br> like I'm a two-year-old, okay?<br> Because there's an element to this thing<br> that I cannot get through my thick head.<br> Didn't you have an obligation<br> to tell your employer...<br> you had this dreaded, deadly,<br> infectious disease?<br> That's not the point.<br> From the day they hired me<br> to the day I was fired...<br> I served my clients consistently,<br> thoroughly, with absolute excellence.<br> If they hadn't fired me,<br> that's what I'd be doing today.<br> And they don't want to fire you<br> for having AIDS...<br> so, in spite of your brilliance,<br> they make you look incompetent.<br> Thus, the mysterious lost files.<br> Is that what you're trying to tell me?<br> Correct. I was sabotaged.<br> I don't buy it, Counselor.<br> That's very disappointing.<br> I don't see a case.<br> I have a case.<br> If you don't want it<br> for personal reasons...<br> Thank you.<br> That's correct. I don't.<br> Well, thank you for your time,<br> Counselor.<br> I'm sorry about what happened to you.<br> It's a bitch, you know?<br> Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.<br> What the hell's the matter<br> with that guy?<br> Iris, find out<br> if Armbruster can see me.<br> - Joe Miller's office.<br> - Iris.<br> - Find out if Armbruster can see me.<br> - Armbruster? When?<br> - Sometime this afternoon.<br> - What's wrong with him?<br> No. Right away, Iris.<br> Excuse me.<br> The HIV virus can only be transmitted<br> through the exchange ofbodily fluids...<br> namely, blood, semen<br> and vaginal secretions.<br> Right. Yeah.<br> But isn't it true they're finding out<br> new things about this disease every day?<br> Now, you tell me today<br> there's no danger. Go home.<br> I go home.<br> I pick up my little baby girl.<br> Then I find out six months from now<br> on the news or something:<br> Whoops! Made a mistake.<br> Yeah, you can carry it...<br> on your shirt<br> or your clothes or...<br> What are you doing?<br> We're gonna draw blood.<br> - Why are we gonna do that?<br> - Joe.<br> Little Joe.<br> I've known you<br> since you were a kid.<br> And I don't care a whit<br> about your private life.<br> Thanks, Doc. I don't need<br> an AIDS test, but thanks anyway.<br> Just send a bill<br> to my office for me.<br> Okay?<br> Thanks for the information.<br> Really.<br> You have a problem with gays, Joe.<br> - Not especially.<br> - Yes, you do.<br> - How many gays do you know?<br> - How many do you know?<br> - Lots.<br> - Like who?<br> Karen Berman, my aunt Theresa...<br> Cousin Tommy<br> who lives in Rochester...<br> Eddie Meyers from the office...<br> Stanley, the guy who's putting in<br> our kitchen cabinets.<br> Aunt Theresa is gay?<br> That beautiful, sensuous,<br> voluptuous woman is a lesbian?<br> Since when?<br> Probably since she was born.<br> Oh, man.<br> All right. Well, hey,<br> I admit it, okay?<br> I'm prejudiced. I don't like<br> homosexuals. There. You got me.<br> - All right.<br> - I mean, the way these guys do that...<br> thing, don't they get confused?<br> "Oh, I don't know.<br> Is that yours? Is that mine?"<br> You know, I don't want to be in bed<br> with anybody who's stronger than me...<br> or who has more hair<br> on their chest.<br> Now, you can call me old-fashioned,<br> conservative. Just call me a man.<br> Besides, I think you have to be a man<br> to understand how...<br> really disgusting<br> that whole idea is anyway.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, well.<br> Little caveman of the house.<br> You damn skippy.<br> Here you go, baby.<br> Stay away from your aunt Theresa too.<br> Joe, don't say that to her.<br> Think about those guys<br> pumping up together...<br> trying to be macho and faggot<br> at the same time.<br> I mean, I can't stand that shit.<br> Hey, I'm bein' totally honest<br> with you, okay?<br> - Oh, yeah. You are.<br> - All right. I got a question for you.<br> Would you accept a client...<br> if you were constantly thinking...<br> "I don't want this person to touch me.<br> I don't want him<br> to even breathe on me"?<br> - Not if I was you, honey.<br> - That's what I'm talking about.<br> What?<br> Ho, ho, ho!<br> Merry Christmas!<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Hey, merry Christmas!<br> - Merry Christmas, sir.<br> Thank...<br> Happy new year.<br> - You're the, uh, the TV guy.<br> - TV guy.<br> Sir?<br> This is the supplement.<br> You're right. There is a section<br> on HIV-related discrimination.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> We do have a private research room<br> available.<br> I'm fine right here.<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me. Do you know where I can find<br> the State v. Murdock case?<br> Just a moment.<br> I'll be right with you.<br> Thanks.<br> Wouldn't you be more comfortable<br> in a research room?<br> No.<br> Would it make you more comfortable?<br> Beckett. How you doin'?<br> Counselor.<br> Whatever, sir.<br> Excuse me.<br> Who'd you get?<br> What?<br> Did you find a lawyer?<br> I'm a lawyer.<br> Hey, how's your baby?<br> Oh, yeah. She's, uh...<br> She's wonderful, great.<br> What's her name?<br> Larice.<br> That's a beautiful name.<br> Named her after my sister.<br> Look, I'm, uh...<br> How'd they find out<br> you have the AIDS?<br> One of the partners noticed<br> a lesion on my forehead.<br> But how do you go from, uh...<br> How do you go from a lawyer spotting<br> a lesion, which could be anything...<br> to the partners deducing<br> that you have AIDS...<br> and terminating you<br> on the basis of that conclusion?<br> That's a good point.<br> The partner who spotted the lesion,<br> Walter Kenton...<br> worked for Walsh,<br> Ulmer and Brahm in D.C.<br> A paralegal there,<br> Melissa Benedict...<br> showed lesions on and off<br> for the better part of two, three years.<br> She says it was common knowledge around<br> the office they were caused by AIDS.<br> But they didn't fire her.<br> No. They did not fire her.<br> I see.<br> So you got a relevant precedent?<br> The Arline decision.<br> - Arline?<br> - Supreme Court.<br> "The Federal Vocational<br> Rehabilitation Act...<br> of 1973 prohibits<br> discrimination...<br> against otherwise<br> qualified handicapped persons...<br> who are able to perform the duties<br> required by their employment.<br> Although the ruling did not<br> address the specific issue...<br> of HIV and AIDS discrimination..."<br> "Subsequent decisions have held<br> that AIDS is protected as a handicap...<br> under law, not only because of<br> the physical limitations it imposes...<br> but because the prejudice<br> surrounding AIDS...<br> exacts a social death which precedes...<br> which precedes<br> the actual physical one."<br> "This is the essence<br> of discrimination:<br> Forming opinions about others<br> not based on their individual merits...<br> but rather their membership in a group<br> with assumed characteristics."<br> - Charles Wheeler.<br> - Julius Erving!<br> - By golly, I'm glad to see you!<br> - Ken Starr.<br> - Ken, how are ya?<br> - How are ya?<br> Come over here.<br> Charles Wheeler, how you doin'?<br> - How are you?<br> - Very good.<br> - Welcome...<br> - Summons for you.<br> Take a look at it.<br> Have a good day.<br> Hey, Dr.J. How are you?<br> You're the best.<br> If you ever need a lawyer for anything,<br> you give me a call.<br> If you slip and fall, you know,<br> accidents, anything, let me know.<br> See you in court.<br> - The TV guy.<br> - Yeah, the TV guy.<br> Say, Chuck, what's up?<br> Now, regarding Andy, I want to know<br> everything regarding his personal life.<br> Does he frequent those pathetic bars<br> on Chestnut Street?<br> - Right.<br> - Oh, Jesus.<br> What other homosexual facilities<br> does he go to?<br> - Absolutely.<br> - Charles.<br> What deviant groups or organizations<br> does he secretly belong to?<br> - First thing in the morning.<br> - Wait a minute!<br> - Look...<br> - What is it?<br> Let's make a fair settlement offer<br> and put this tragic business behind us.<br> Bob...<br> Andy brought AIDS into our offices...<br> into our men's room.<br> He brought AIDS<br> to our annual goddamn family picnic.<br> We ought to be suing him, Bob.<br> Where is your compassion,<br> gentlemen?<br> Bob, we gave him Highline.<br> Did Andrew Beckett say...<br> "I might not be able to serve<br> our client to the best of my ability"?<br> He said nothing.<br> And now, disregarding the trust<br> and affection I conferred upon him...<br> Andrew Beckett proposes<br> to haul me into court...<br> to sling accusations at me,<br> to call me a bigot...<br> in full view of the entire<br> Philadelphia judicial establishment.<br> My God!<br> Excuse me.<br> Beckett doesn't want to go to court.<br> He wants a quick, tasty settlement.<br> A jury might decide<br> that he has a case.<br> Wait a minute.<br> He was fired for incompetence,<br> not because he has AIDS.<br> You didn't know he was sick,<br> did you, Bob?<br> Holy shit.<br> Did you, Bob?<br> No. No, not really.<br> Okay, everybody.<br> Everybody, this is the house<br> that I grew up in...<br> right here in the hometown<br> of Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.<br> Wait, here's proof.<br> There. My handprints<br> from when I was a cute little boy.<br> Today is the 40th wedding anniversary<br> of my mom and dad, the Becketts.<br> Isn't that somethin'?<br> Pretty tough life around this poverty<br> so many years, huh?<br> Well, those can be some pretty mean<br> streets. Don't let appearances fool you.<br> Here's the front door.<br> Now, I once slammed...<br> this finger in the front door<br> and I broke it.<br> There's my sisterJill,<br> everybody.<br> - Say hello, Alexis.<br> - Mommy's pregnant again!<br> What? Are you really?<br> - Hi, Meghan.<br> - It's Uncle Andy!<br> - Where's Dad?<br> - He's trying to fix the snowblower.<br> It snows once in seven years,<br> Dad buys a new snowblower.<br> Oh, me. How are you?<br> Oh, Mom, today's a good day.<br> Meghan, keep that up.<br> You're doin' a great job.<br> I gotta say hello<br> to the Bronte sisters.<br> How are you?<br> Good to see you.<br> Hi, Lee. How are you?<br> Put me down!<br> If you let me love you<br> It's for sure I'm gonna love you<br> All the way<br> All<br> Bud and Sarah<br> All the way<br> There will be things said at the trial<br> that are hard for you to hear...<br> about me and my personal life.<br> And there's gonna be publicity. I want<br> to make sure it's okay with everybody.<br> Andy, you want me to take her?<br> No. She's fine.<br> I think it's great<br> that you're asking, Andy...<br> but this is really your call.<br> All right.<br> Thank you, brother.<br> Hey, you're my kid brother.<br> That's all that matters.<br> Okay?<br> To be honest,<br> I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.<br> They've been through<br> so much already.<br> And it's possible there are going to be<br> some very tough times ahead.<br> Andy, the way that you've handled<br> this whole thing...<br> you and Miguel...<br> with so much courage...<br> I don't believe there's anything...<br> that anyone could say<br> that would...<br> make us feel anything<br> but incredibly proud of you.<br> Well, I didn't raise my kids<br> to sit in the back of the bus.<br> You get in there<br> and you fight for your rights, okay?<br> Gee, I love you guys.<br> Ladies and gentlemen of thejury...<br> forget everything you've seen<br> on television and in the movies.<br> There's not gonna be<br> any last-minute surprise witnesses.<br> Nobody's gonna break down on the stand<br> with a tearful confession.<br> You're gonna be presented with<br> a simple fact:<br> Andrew Beckett was fired.<br> You'll hear two explanations<br> for why he was fired:<br> Ours and theirs.<br> It is up to you to sift<br> through layer upon layer of truth...<br> until you determine for yourselves<br> which version sounds the most true.<br> There are certain points<br> that I must prove to you.<br> Point number one:<br> Andrew Beckett was...<br> is... a brilliant lawyer...<br> a great lawyer.<br> Point number two: Andrew Beckett,<br> afflicted with a debilitating disease...<br> made the understandable,<br> the personal...<br> the legal choice to keep<br> the fact of his illness to himself.<br> Point number three:<br> His employers discovered his illness.<br> And, ladies and gentlemen,<br> the illness I'm referring to is AIDS.<br> Point number four: They panicked.<br> And in their panic, they did what most<br> of us would like to do with AIDS...<br> which is just get it<br> and everybody who has it...<br> as far away from the rest of us<br> as possible.<br> Now, the behavior of Andrew Beckett's<br> employers may seem reasonable to you.<br> It does to me.<br> After all, AIDS is a deadly,<br> incurable disease.<br> But no matter how you come to judge<br> Charles Wheeler and his partners...<br> in ethical, moral and human terms,<br> the fact of the matter is...<br> when they fired Andrew Beckett<br> because he had AIDS...<br> they broke the law.<br> Fact:<br> Andrew Beckett's performance<br> on the job...<br> varied from competent, good...<br> to oftentimes mediocre...<br> to sometimes flagrantly incompetent.<br> Fact:<br> He claims he's the victim<br> of lies and deceit.<br> Fact:<br> It was Andrew Beckett who lied...<br> going to great lengths to conceal<br> his disease from his employers.<br> Fact:<br> He was successful<br> in his duplicity.<br> The partners at Wyant, Wheeler<br> did not know...<br> that Andrew Beckett had AIDS<br> when they fired him.<br> Fact:<br> Andrew Beckett is dying.<br> Fact:<br> Andrew Beckett is angry...<br> because his lifestyle,<br> his reckless behavior...<br> has cut short his life.<br> And in his anger, his rage...<br> he is lashing out.<br> And he wants someone to pay.<br> Thank you.<br> Andrew Beckett represented your company<br> in a lawsuit in 1990. Is that correct?<br> That's correct.<br> Were you pleased<br> with his work?<br> We were satisfied<br> with the outcome of the litigation.<br> Satisfied.<br> Mr. Laird, when I approached you<br> about being a witness in this trial...<br> you gave sworn testimony<br> in a deposition, is that correct?<br> That's correct.<br> In that deposition, you said that<br> you were impressed and delighted...<br> with the quality<br> of Andrew Beckett's work.<br> Do you recall saying that?<br> In all honesty,<br> I was delighted...<br> with certain aspects<br> of Andy's efforts.<br> But in general,<br> I found the work to be...<br> merely satisfactory.<br> Do you agree...<br> that a bologna sandwich<br> is a satisfactory meal?<br> Whereas caviar<br> and champagne...<br> roast duck and baked Alaska...<br> that might be considered<br> a delightful meal?<br> We object. These gastronomical comments<br> are irrelevant, Your Honor.<br> They are not irrelevant.<br> Your Honor, five months ago this witness<br> characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar.<br> Now he's a bologna sandwich.<br> I think the jury<br> is entitled to know...<br> what powerful force<br> has caused him to change his mind.<br> He hasn't changed his mind.<br> He's amplified his answer.<br> Objection sustained.<br> All right.<br> Mr. Laird, explain this to me<br> like I'm a four-year-old, okay?<br> Did Andrew Beckett<br> win your lawsuit for you?<br> Yes, we won.<br> Oh, congratulations!<br> That must've been a very...<br> satisfactory experience.<br> "AIDS Cures Homosexuality"<br> Homophobia's got to go. Hey, hey!<br> - Ready, Mr. Beckett?<br> - Get ready. Here they come.<br> No rights for sodomites!<br> Adam and Eve!<br> Not Adam and Steve!<br> Thou shalt not lie<br> with mankind.<br> Do you see this<br> as a gay rights issue?<br> I am not political.<br> I just want what is fair, what is right.<br> But you are gay, aren't you?<br> I don't see how that's<br> any of your business. But, yes, I am.<br> Totally irrelevant.<br> Do you think that homosexuals<br> deserve special treatment?<br> - Hell, no!<br> - We're in Philadelphia...<br> the City of Brotherly Love,<br> birthplace of freedom...<br> where the Founding Fathers authored<br> the Declaration of Independence.<br> I don't recall that<br> glorious document saying...<br> anything about all straight men<br> are created equal.<br> I believe it says<br> all men are created equal.<br> Gimme a goddamn break.<br> As far as someone being fired<br> from a law firm or a business...<br> if we found that their action<br> was discriminatory...<br> they'd do no business with the city.<br> - Thank you, Mayor.<br> - Yo!<br> You're not getting a little light<br> in the sneakers, are you, pal?<br> Yeah, I am, Filko.<br> I'm changing.<br> I'm on the prowl.<br> And I'm looking for a hunk,<br> not just any hunk.<br> I mean a man,<br> a real man like you.<br> You can tell everybody. You know<br> what we do. You wanna play sailor?<br> - Remember? You're the first mate?<br> - That's not funny!<br> Let me tell you something.<br> These people make me sick.<br> But a law's been broken.<br> You remember the law?<br> At least we agree<br> on one thing, Joe.<br> What's that, Charlie?<br> Tutti-fruttis make me sick too.<br> Ms. Benedict, is it true you worked<br> for Walsh, Ulmer and Brahm...<br> at the same time as Walter Kenton?<br> That's correct.<br> At that time,<br> did Walter Kenton know...<br> the K.S. Lesions on your face<br> and arms were caused by AIDS?<br> Definitely.<br> I told all the partners.<br> How did Walter Kenton treat you<br> after you told him you had AIDS?<br> Every time he'd come in contact with me,<br> he'd get this look on his face.<br> I refer to it<br> as the "Oh, God" expression.<br> As in, "Oh, God,<br> here comes that woman with AIDS."<br> Thank you, Ms. Benedict.<br> No more questions, Your Honor.<br> Ms. Benedict,<br> how did you contract the AIDS virus?<br> Through a transfusion. I lost a lot of<br> blood giving birth to my second child.<br> So, in your case<br> there was no behavior on your part...<br> which caused you to be<br> infected with the virus.<br> It was something you were unable<br> to avoid. Isn't that correct?<br> I guess.<br> Thank you.<br> But I don't<br> consider myself...<br> any different from anyone else<br> with this disease.<br> I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.<br> I'm just trying to survive.<br> Thank you, Ms. Benedict.<br> No further questions<br> at this time, Your Honor.<br> You may step down, Mrs. Benedict.<br> Beyond noticing<br> the marks on his face...<br> were there other things<br> about his appearance, Miss Burton...<br> that made you suspect<br> that Andrew had AIDS?<br> He was getting thinner,<br> and he seemed very tired sometimes.<br> But he was working so hard.<br> Still, I felt something was wrong.<br> And I can't believe they're pretending<br> that they didn't notice anything.<br> Objection.<br> Just answer the question, please.<br> Have you ever felt discriminated against<br> at Wyant, Wheeler?<br> Well, yes.<br> - In what way?<br> - Well...<br> Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia...<br> said that Mr. Wheeler<br> had a problem with my earrings.<br> - Really?<br> - Apparently Mr. Wheeler felt...<br> that they were too...<br> "ethnic" is the word she used.<br> She told me he said<br> he would like it...<br> if I wore something<br> a little less garish...<br> a little smaller and more American.<br> What'd you say?<br> I said, "My earrings are American.<br> They're African-American."<br> Let's have order, please.<br> Thank you. No more questions.<br> Ms. Burton...<br> weren't you recently promoted?<br> Yes. I'm in charge<br> of the paralegal department.<br> Congratulations on your unfettered<br> ascendancy at Wyant, Wheeler.<br> I don't know if I'd go so far<br> as to call it unfettered.<br> I don't understand.<br> How do you explain...<br> the promotion of an obviously...<br> intelligent, articulate...<br> qualified<br> African-American woman...<br> in a firm which practices<br> discrimination...<br> as wantonly and consistently<br> as you and Mr. Beckett claim?<br> - I can't explain it.<br> - Could it be...<br> that these...<br> instances of discrimination...<br> are in fact misunderstandings...<br> that have been blown<br> completely out of proportion?<br> I think counsel tends to<br> oversimplify the issue somewhat.<br> Thank you, Miss Burton,<br> I'll...<br> take that note<br> under consideration.<br> - How's the trial going?<br> - Excuse me?<br> It's a great case. I saw you on<br> television. I'm a law student at Penn.<br> - How you doing?<br> - All right. How are you?<br> - Saw me on TV?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's a good school, Penn.<br> What year are you in?<br> Second. Listen,<br> I just want to tell you...<br> this case,<br> it's tremendously important.<br> I wanted to let you know<br> I think you're doing a fantastic job.<br> - Hey.<br> - Thank you. All right.<br> When you graduate,<br> you give me a call.<br> Okay. All right.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Listen, Joe?<br> - Yeah?<br> Would you like to have a drink? I just<br> finished a game and could use a beer.<br> Ah, no, I can't.<br> My wife is...<br> I don't pick up people<br> in drugstores every day.<br> - You think I'm gay?<br> - Aren't you?<br> What's the matter?<br> I look gay to you?<br> Do I look gay to you?<br> - Relax.<br> - I ought to kick your faggoty ass.<br> Take it as a compliment.<br> Geez!<br> That is exactly the kind of bullshit<br> that makes people hate your...<br> faggoty ass.<br> You want to try<br> and kick my ass, Joe?<br> - Asshole.<br> - No, you're the asshole, buddy!<br> Please continue, Ms. O'Hara.<br> We were going crazy looking<br> for this complaint.<br> I felt like I was<br> in the twilight zone.<br> Mr. Beckett was screaming<br> at everybody and he just...<br> He looked so freaky.<br> Mr. Kenton kept saying,<br> "You lost the Highline complaint?"<br> And he called Mr. Wheeler,<br> and all of a sudden...<br> Jamey comes in with the complaint<br> in his hand.<br> - He says, "It was in central files."<br> - Central files?<br> Central files is a place where paperwork<br> is sent when cases are closed.<br> Jamey ran it over<br> to the court just in time...<br> and everybody just stood<br> there completely wasted.<br> And Mr...<br> And Mr. Beckett<br> just kept saying...<br> "I'm sorry. Sorry.<br> I don't understand this."<br> Thank you, Ms. O'Hara.<br> No further questions<br> at this time, Your Honor.<br> All right. Mr. Miller.<br> - May I?<br> - Certainly.<br> Thank you.<br> - You okay?<br> - Yes.<br> - You want a glass of water?<br> - No.<br> Was Andy a good boss?<br> Yes.<br> He was very sweet.<br> How would you characterize<br> his work as an attorney?<br> How would I know?<br> I just worked for him.<br> Excuse me, Your Honor,<br> but is this for the record?<br> Mr. Miller, perhaps you should<br> return to counsel's table.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Miss O'Hara?<br> - Yes?<br> Were you aware...<br> at any time of any problems<br> that the senior partners had...<br> with the quality of Andrew's work<br> prior to this missing file episode?<br> No, I wasn't.<br> Thank you.<br> No more questions, Your Honor.<br> Is Andrew Becket the kind of lawyer<br> who misplaces crucial documents?<br> Not to my knowledge. No.<br> If you wanted to make a lawyer look<br> incompetent, would this be a good way?<br> Hiding an important document<br> maybe for a few hours...<br> and then making it look like<br> the responsible lawyer misplaced it?<br> Why would Mr. Wheeler and the others<br> behave so outrageously?<br> Because they found out<br> Andy was sick?<br> - He's not answering the question.<br> - Perhaps.<br> We've had lawyers with heart attacks,<br> ulcers, prostate cancer, leukemia!<br> No one sandbagged them.<br> Did you have something to do with this<br> file being lost accidentally on purpose?<br> - Objection.<br> - I'll rephrase.<br> Did you have anything<br> to do with this file being misplaced?<br> Absolutely not.<br> Are you a homosexual?<br> - What?<br> - Answer the question! Are you a homo?<br> A faggot? A punk?<br> A queen, pillow biter, fairy?<br> Bootie snatcher, rump roaster?<br> Are you gay?<br> - Objection!<br> - Order!<br> Where did this come from? Suddenly<br> counsel's attacking his own witness?<br> Mr. Collins' sexual orientation<br> has nothing to do with this case.<br> Please have a seat, Miss Conine.<br> Would you approach the bench,<br> Mr. Miller?<br> Could you kindly<br> share with me...<br> exactly what's going on<br> inside your head...<br> because at this moment,<br> I don't have a clue.<br> Your Honor...<br> everybody in this courtroom...<br> is thinking about sexual orientation,<br> sexual preference...<br> whatever you want to call it.<br> Who does what to whom<br> and how they do it.<br> They're looking at Andrew Beckett.<br> They're thinking about it.<br> They're looking at Mr. Wheeler,<br> Miss Conine, even you, Your Honor.<br> They're wondering about it.<br> Trust me, I know they're looking at me<br> and thinking about it.<br> So let's get it out in the open.<br> Let's get it out of the closet.<br> Because this case is not<br> just about AIDS, is it?<br> So let's talk about what<br> this case is really all about:<br> The general public's hatred,<br> our loathing...<br> our fear of homosexuals...<br> and how that climate<br> of hatred and fear...<br> translated into the firing<br> of this particular homosexual...<br> my client, Andrew Beckett.<br> Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.<br> Very good.<br> In this courtroom, Mr. Miller,<br> justice is blind...<br> to matters of race, creed, color...<br> religion and sexual orientation.<br> With all due respect,<br> Your Honor...<br> we don't live in this courtroom,<br> though, do we?<br> No, we don't.<br> However, as regards to this witness...<br> I'm going to sustain<br> the defense's objection.<br> How many weeks would you be out to sea<br> without stopping at port?<br> Oh, anywhere from two weeks<br> to several months.<br> Any women on board?<br> Not when I was in the navy.<br> So, during these long voyages...<br> months at a time out to sea,<br> no women in sight...<br> hundreds of hardworking, robust<br> young men in the prime of their lives...<br> at the peak of their natural appetites<br> and desires...<br> their God-given hormonal instincts,<br> anything going on?<br> Going on? Like what?<br> Like two sailors down below<br> making flippy-flop.<br> - Objection.<br> - Mr. Miller.<br> We had one guy like that.<br> You haven't ruled on my objection,<br> Your Honor.<br> Go on, Mr. Miller.<br> You had one guy like that.<br> You mean a homosexual?<br> He strutted around quarters naked<br> trying to get everybody to notice him.<br> Made everyone sick.<br> He was destroying our morale.<br> So we let him know this kind<br> of behavior was not acceptable.<br> How'd you do that?<br> Wrote him a letter?<br> We stuck his head in a latrine<br> after ten of us had used it.<br> - You taught him a lesson, didn't you?<br> - Yes, we did.<br> - Like firing Andrew taught him a lesson.<br> - Objection.<br> I withdraw. You were aware<br> when you worked with Melissa Benedict...<br> that she had AIDS, correct?<br> - She didn't try to conceal it.<br> - So you are aware...<br> of the difference between<br> a bruise and a lesion. Correct?<br> Beckett told me he had been hit<br> by a racket ball, and I believed him.<br> Did you avoid contact with Ms. Benedict<br> after you found out she had AIDS?<br> She says and I quote, that you were<br> repulsed by her. Is that correct?<br> I felt,<br> and I still feel nothing...<br> but the deepest sympathy and compassion<br> for people like Melissa...<br> who contracted this terrible disease<br> through no fault of their own.<br> Don't move now.<br> Okay.<br> Boy. It's not going through.<br> We may have to flush it out again.<br> The vein's closed.<br> We've got to call Barbara.<br> - Nurse Ratchett.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Yeah.

First I'll ask you...<br> "Can you describe<br> the circumstances in which...<br> you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,<br> Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"<br> Miller?<br> Do you ever pray?<br> Andrew, that is not<br> the answer to the question.<br> But, yes, I pray.<br> - What do you pray for?<br> - What do you mean?<br> I pray that... I don't know!<br> I pray my baby is healthy.<br> I pray my wife made it through delivery.<br> I pray the Phillies<br> win the pennant.<br> Now, can we go through<br> these questions?<br> Number one: "Can you describe<br> the circumstances in which...<br> you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,<br> Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"<br> Can you do that for me?<br> There's a possibility I won't be around<br> to see the end of this trial.<br> Yes, I've considered that.<br> I've made some provisions<br> in my will for some charities.<br> Miguel will need a lawyer.<br> I know it's not your area.<br> I know a good probate lawyer.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome. Now...<br> "Can you describe<br> the circumstances in which...<br> you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,<br> Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"<br> Do you mind this music?<br> Do you like opera?<br> I am not that familiar<br> with opera, Andrew.<br> Oh, this is my favorite aria.<br> It's Maria Callas.<br> It's Andrea Chenier.<br> Umberto Giordano.<br> This is Madeleine.<br> She's saying how...<br> during the French Revolution<br> the mob set fire to her house.<br> And her mother died,<br> saving her.<br> She says, "Look!<br> The place that cradled me<br> is burning.<br> I am alone."<br> Do you hear the heartache<br> in her voice?<br> Can you feel it?<br> Now, in come the strings,<br> and it changes everything.<br> It's like the music...<br> it fills with a hope.<br> And that'll change again.<br> Listen.<br> Listen.<br> "I bring sorrow<br> to those who love me."<br> Oh, that single cello!<br> "It was during this sorrow<br> that love came to me.<br> A voice filled with harmony.<br> It said, "Live still.<br> I am life.<br> Heaven is in your eyes.<br> It's everything around you.<br> It's the blood and the mud.<br> I am divine!<br> I am oblivion.<br> I am the god...<br> that comes down from the heavens<br> to the earth...<br> and makes of the earth a heaven.<br> I am love.<br> I am love."<br> Geez, I better get out of here.<br> Lisa's...<br> I told her that, you know...<br> I'll look over the Q and A.<br> No, you're ready.<br> Jesus.<br> God.<br> Yes, baby.<br> Oh, I love you, little Larice.<br> Place your left hand on the Bible.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and<br> nothing but the truth, so help you God?<br> - I do.<br> - Please be seated.<br> Andrew, can you describe<br> the circumstances in which...<br> you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,<br> Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?<br> Wyant, Wheeler<br> aggressively recruited me.<br> They were the most<br> prestigious firm in Philadelphia...<br> full of opportunity.<br> And I was impressed<br> with the partners.<br> - Including Charles Wheeler?<br> - Particularly Charles.<br> What impressed you about him?<br> He was the kind of lawyer<br> I thought I wanted to be.<br> What kind of lawyer is that?<br> Possessed of an encyclopedic<br> knowledge of the law...<br> a razor-sharp litigator,<br> genuine leader.<br> Gifted at bringing out<br> the very best in others...<br> and an awesome ability<br> to illuminate...<br> the most complex of legal concepts<br> to a colleague, a courtroom...<br> to the man in the street.<br> The kind of person who can play<br> three sets of tennis...<br> but doesn't sweat.<br> Underneath an elegant surface...<br> he has an adventurous spirit.<br> In the years<br> you worked at Wyant, Wheeler...<br> did you ever tell Charles Wheeler<br> you were gay?<br> No, I didn't.<br> Why not?<br> You don't bring your personal life<br> into a law firm.<br> You're not supposed to have<br> a personal life, really.<br> Anyway, I did plan<br> to tell Charles eventually.<br> But then something happened...<br> at the racket club...<br> about three years ago.<br> Somebody started telling<br> some jokes.<br> What do you call a woman who has<br> P.M.S. and E.S.P. at the same time?<br> I don't know!<br> What do you call her?<br> A bitch who knows everything.<br> Sounds like someone I know.<br> Hey, Walter, how does a faggot<br> fake an orgasm?<br> He throws a quart of hot yogurt<br> on your back!<br> That reminds me...<br> How'd that make you feel?<br> Relieved...<br> that I never told him<br> I was gay.<br> Just very relieved.<br> All right.<br> Are you a good lawyer, Andrew?<br> I'm an excellent lawyer.<br> What makes you<br> an excellent lawyer?<br> I love the law.<br> I know the law.<br> I excel at practicing.<br> What do you love<br> about the law, Andrew?<br> I... Many things.<br> What I love the most?<br> Yes.<br> Is that<br> every now and again...<br> not often, but occasionally...<br> you get to be a part of...<br> justice being done.<br> That really is...<br> quite a thrill<br> when that happens.<br> Thank you, Andrew.<br> You said earlier...<br> you aspire to be the kind of person<br> who had an adventurous spirit, correct?<br> Something like that.<br> Do you take risks?<br> In my work, yes.<br> Calculated risks.<br> You have to.<br> Did your doctor ever tell you<br> to reduce stress?<br> That long hours<br> and stressful working conditions...<br> might damage the immune system...<br> and speed up your illness?<br> My doctor mentioned the impact AIDS...<br> Excuse me.<br> My doctor mentioned the impact<br> stress could have on the immune system.<br> Have you ever been<br> to the Stallion Showcase Cinema...<br> on 21st Street?<br> I've been to...<br> that...<br> I've been to that theater...<br> three times in my life.<br> What kind of movies<br> do they show there?<br> Gay movies.<br> Gay pornographic movies?<br> Yes.<br> Objection, Your Honor.<br> Your Honor, this line of questioning<br> is vital to the issue of credibility.<br> Let's see where this is going.<br> Continue, Counselor.<br> Do men have sex with each other<br> in that theater?<br> Some men.<br> Have you ever had sex with anyone<br> in that theater?<br> I'm Robert.<br> Andy.<br> Yes.<br> Once.<br> When? Approximately what year<br> did that event take place?<br> I guess it was 1984.<br> '84, '85.<br> Were you aware in 1984, '85...<br> that there was a fatal disease<br> out there called AIDS...<br> and that you could contract it<br> through sexual activity?<br> I'd heard of some...<br> I'd heard of a thing.<br> The gay plague, the gay cancer.<br> We didn't know<br> how you could get it...<br> or that it killed you.<br> Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?<br> No. I could use some water, though.<br> John, would you<br> bring Mr. Beckett some water?<br> While you were employed at Wyant,<br> Wheeler you did everything you could...<br> to make sure no one knew<br> that you were an active homosexual.<br> Correct?<br> No.<br> That's not correct.<br> I never lied about it.<br> As a homosexual...<br> one is often forced to conceal<br> one's sexuality.<br> Isn't that right?<br> In some circumstances, yes.<br> Isn't it true you've spent your life<br> pretending to be something you're not...<br> so much so that the art<br> of concealment and dishonesty...<br> - has become second nature...<br> - Your Honor, I object!<br> I'll withdraw it,<br> Your Honor.<br> Mr. Beckett, were you living with...<br> Miguel Alvarez...<br> in 1984 or '85<br> when you had your...<br> anonymous sexual encounter<br> in the porn theater?<br> Yes.<br> So you could have infected him,<br> isn't that right?<br> Miguel has not been infected.<br> You didn't answer my question.<br> You could have infected Mr. Alvarez<br> at that time. Is that correct?<br> Yes.<br> You've testified that<br> the lesions on your face...<br> were visible to the people<br> that you worked with, correct?<br> That's right.<br> And you contend that when the partners<br> were made aware of the lesions...<br> that they leapt to the conclusion<br> that you had AIDS and fired you.<br> Is that correct?<br> As painful as it is...<br> to accuse my former colleagues...<br> of such reprehensible behavior...<br> it is the only conclusion<br> I could come to.<br> Do you have any lesions<br> on your face at this time?<br> One here...<br> right by my ear.<br> Your Honor,<br> may I approach the witness?<br> Yes, you may.<br> Remembering that<br> you're under oath...<br> answering truthfully...<br> can you see the lesions<br> on your face in this mirror...<br> from three feet away?<br> Answering truthfully.<br> Well, l...<br> At the time I was fired...<br> I had four lesions,<br> and they were much bigger.<br> Could you answer<br> the question, please?<br> Well, no.<br> No, I can't really see it.<br> No more questions, Your Honor.<br> This would be a good time<br> to break for today.<br> - We can reconvene in the morning.<br> - I hate this case.<br> Your Honor, may I have<br> five minutes in redirect?<br> Mr. Beckett, can you go on<br> for five minutes?<br> - Three minutes.<br> - Yes.<br> May I borrow your mirror, please?<br> Do you have any lesions on any part<br> of your body at this time...<br> that resemble the lesions<br> you had on your face...<br> at the time that you were fired?<br> Yes. On my torso.<br> Your torso.<br> If it please the court...<br> I would like to ask Andrew<br> to remove his shirt...<br> so that everyone could get an accurate<br> idea of what we're talking about.<br> Objection.<br> Your Honor, it would<br> unfairly influence the jury.<br> Your Honor, if Andrew was forced to use<br> a wheelchair due to his illness...<br> would the defense ask him<br> to park it outside...<br> because it would<br> unfairly influence the jury?<br> We're talking about AIDS, about lesions.<br> Let's see what we're talking about.<br> I'll allow it.<br> Mr. Beckett, would you please<br> remove your shirt?<br> My God, what a nightmare!<br> He asked for it.<br> Can you see the lesions<br> on your chest in this mirror?<br> Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> Do you swear to tell the whole truth,<br> so help you God?<br> I do.<br> Please be seated.<br> Mr. Wheeler, were you aware<br> that Andrew Beckett...<br> was suffering from AIDS at the time<br> of his departure from Wyant, Wheeler?<br> - No.<br> - For absolute clarity...<br> did you fire Andrew Beckett...<br> because he had AIDS?<br> No, I did not fire Andrew Beckett<br> because he had AIDS.<br> Mr. Wheeler, can you explain,<br> in a way that leaves no doubt...<br> why you promoted...<br> Andrew Beckett through your firm?<br> And then, most importantly...<br> why you eventually<br> asked him to leave?<br> If you're the owner<br> of a major league ball club...<br> you recruit the hot rookie.<br> And Andy was tremendously promising<br> as a young attorney.<br> Fresh out of Penn.<br> Crackerjack.<br> That's why we went after him.<br> That's why we hired him.<br> And that's why we stuck with him<br> year after year.<br> Why did you give him...<br> opportunity after opportunity?<br> Well, when you groom someone...<br> the way we groomed Andy,<br> nurturing him...<br> lavishing all kinds of<br> special treatment on him...<br> you make quite an investment.<br> We were waiting for the promise<br> to kick in and deliver.<br> But ultimately<br> we could no longer...<br> ignore the gap between<br> the reality and the promise.<br> Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.<br> No more questions<br> at this time, Your Honor.<br> Mr. Miller?<br> Objection!<br> - Your Honor, objection.<br> - All right, Mr. Miller.<br> - That'll be sufficient.<br> - Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.<br> You are my hero.<br> Andrew is right.<br> You are the greatest.<br> Are you gay?<br> Objection.<br> How dare you!<br> Witness will kindly answer.<br> No, I am not a homosexual.<br> Isn't it true that<br> when you realized...<br> Andrew Beckett... your golden boy,<br> your future senior partner...<br> was gay and had AIDS...<br> it drove a stake of fear<br> right through your heterosexual heart?<br> Remembering...<br> all the hugs and handshakes,<br> the intimate moments in the sauna...<br> the friendly pats on the backside<br> that you and Andrew exchanged...<br> like guys exchange.<br> It made you say, "My God!<br> What does this say about me?"<br> Objection, Your Honor.<br> The witness will please<br> respond to the question.<br> You may tap dance around me<br> all you wish...<br> with your innuendoes<br> and locker room fantasies.<br> But the truth still remains<br> that your client...<br> worked when he wanted to work...<br> telling us what he thought we needed<br> to know about who he really was.<br> Andy insisted on bending the rules...<br> and his work suffered tremendously<br> in the long run as a result of that.<br> Explain this like I'm a six-year-old,<br> 'cause I just don't get it.<br> Who makes these rules that<br> you're talking about? You?<br> Read your Bible, Mr. Miller,<br> Old and New Testament.<br> Pretty valuable rules in there.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse... I can't...<br> Excuse me!<br> Christ's sakes, somebody get a doctor!<br> What is it?<br> Turn over now.<br> - Call an ambulance, please?<br> - Right away.<br> An ambulance, please!<br> Let him breathe.<br> Please make room for him.<br> It's not working.<br> - Please, sir!<br> - It's not working!<br> - They know how to save him.<br> - It is making him worse!<br> Did you notice any changes<br> whatsoever in Andrew's appearance...<br> over the course of the year<br> leading up to his termination?<br> Yes. I did.<br> Were these changes for the better<br> or for the worse?<br> Sometimes for the better,<br> but generally they were for the worse.<br> Mr. Seidman, what did you think caused<br> these changes in Andy's appearance?<br> I was afraid.<br> I suspected Andy had AIDS.<br> - Order.<br> - Thank you. Your witness.<br> - Miss Conine?<br> - Mr. Seidman...<br> did you share your suspicions<br> with Mr. Wheeler...<br> or any of the other managing partners<br> at any time...<br> before the decision<br> to fire Andrew Beckett was made?<br> No. I didn't.<br> I didn't mention it to anyone...<br> not even Andy.<br> I didn't even give him a chance<br> to talk about it.<br> And I think<br> I'm going to regret that...<br> for as long as I live.<br> - Any more questions, Miss Conine?<br> - That's all, Your Honor.<br> They are sayin'he wasn't<br> a good lawyer. He was mediocre.<br> And the fact that they gave him the most<br> important lawsuit they ever had...<br> for one of their most<br> important clients...<br> They say that doesn't prove anything<br> because that was just a test.<br> - What'd they call it? A carrot?<br> - Yeah. "What's up, Doc?"<br> To see if he'd rise to the occasion.<br> Okay.<br> Say I gotta send a pilot<br> into enemy territory...<br> and he's gonna be flyin' a plane<br> that costs $350 million.<br> Who am I gonna put in that plane?<br> Some rookie who can't cut it so<br> I can see if he is up to the challenge?<br> Or am I gonna give that assignment<br> to my best pilot...<br> my sharpest, my most experienced,<br> my top gun...<br> the very best I got?<br> I just don't get that.<br> Would somebody please<br> explain it to me...<br> like I'm a six-year-old?<br> - Juror number six?<br> - I agree.<br> - Juror number seven?<br> - I agree.<br> - Juror number nine?<br> - I agree.<br> Juror number ten?<br> - I disagree.<br> - Juror number 11?<br> - I agree.<br> - Juror number 12?<br> Agree.<br> Have you awarded any damages?<br> Yes, Your Honor, we have.<br> For back pay and loss of benefits<br> we award $143,000.<br> For mental anguish and humiliation<br> we award $100,000.<br> And for punitive damages<br> we award $4,782,000.<br> You may record the verdict.<br> Everyone remain seated<br> until the jury is removed.<br> How could they do that?<br> This trial is now concluded.<br> Congratulations!<br> We'll strain ourselves<br> getting a reversal on this one.<br> - We'll get started in the morning.<br> - Well, that's that.<br> Congratulations, Mr. Miller.<br> I'll see you at the appeal.<br> Congratulations.<br> Well done.<br> Oh, man.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> - I'll see ya at the hospital.<br> - Okay.<br> Oh, Mr. Miller.<br> Hi.
