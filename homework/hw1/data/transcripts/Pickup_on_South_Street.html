Come on, hit me!<br> Come on, hit me, will ya?<br> What's the matter? You nervous?<br> - Come on.<br> - Zara.<br> All we want is the wallet.<br> If you got rid of it, tell us.<br> - If you tossed the film away, tell us where.<br> - Who's he?<br> None of your business.<br> Just answer the man.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> I've been clean ever since I got out last week.<br> Wouldn't touch a nickel if it was<br> laying in the street. Word of honor.<br> Why don't you haul that girl down here<br> to identify me? It's my word against hers.<br> No. It's your word against mine.<br> I saw you close her purse.<br> All right. So it's your word.<br> But you gotta nail the goods on me,<br> and I'm clean.<br> Go ahead.

Me?<br> - I don't think anything. I know.<br> I know what you're after.<br> I know what it's worth.<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> - You know, all right.<br> But what you don't know<br> is that when I grifted your wallet...<br> I was pulled in by the cops.<br> You know how hard it is to spot<br> my fingers in action? Can't be done.<br> But a guy did it. You know how he did it?<br> He was watchin' you.<br> And that guy you were supposed<br> to pass the film to...<br> you don't know about him either, huh?<br> - He's still waitin'. He's itchin' for it.<br> - Look, Skip...<br> the way I feel about you,<br> I wouldn't lie to you.<br> - You gotta believe me.<br> - I gotta believe nobody.<br> I'll do business with a Red,<br> but I don't have to believe one.<br> I'm sorry, Skip.

Y-You got to promise me, Moe.<br> When Joey asks you,<br> you don't know where Skip lives.<br> - He won't find me.<br> - He knows where you live.<br> - Well, why ain't he here?<br> - I gave him a phony address for Skip.<br> He's lookin' for him now.<br> So why don't you tell Skip?<br> He won't believe a word I tell him.<br> Oh. So he crawled<br> under your skin, too, huh?<br> He's as shifty as smoke,<br> but I love him.<br> You sold him out for 50 bucks.<br> Oh, look. Some people peddle apples,<br> lamb chops, lumber.<br> I peddle information.<br> Skip ain't sore.<br> He understands.<br> We live in a different kind of a world.<br> Oh, once in a while,<br> he gets hot under the collar if I sell him short.<br> But you wouldn't sell him to a Commie.<br> What do you think I am, an informer?<br> Coffee.<br> Stay away from your shack, Skip.<br> There's -There's a guy gunnin' for ya.<br> He won't have any trouble finding me.<br> Everybody in town knows where I live.<br> I didn't pinpoint you, honest.<br> I give Tiger the name of eight cannons,<br> but that creep that was with him...<br> he fingered your picture like a shot.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Confidentially, it sounded like<br> your kind of an act.<br> You think so, huh?<br> How much did you raise on me<br> for your stone and plot?<br> Oh, don't be sore.
