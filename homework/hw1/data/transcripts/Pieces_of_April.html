I just...<br> It's just... I keep waiting|for a good time to tell you,<br> but there's really no good time.<br> I need everyone to listen.<br> I don't know how to say this.<br> We need to discuss how|each of you... Oh, God...<br> It's okay, sweetie.<br> How each of you,|in your own way,<br> is going to handle...<br> discarding food without|letting our hostess know.<br> Oh, please.|Joy, really.<br> That's not very funny.<br> Here's what I suggest...<br> Take a bite of whatever it is...|let's say the green bean casserole.<br> Pretend to chew, cough,|bring napkin to mouth,<br> spit food into napkin,|excuse yourself.<br> Drop food in toilet.<br> Flush.<br> Honey, roll it tighter next time.<br> Sorry, Mom.<br> Won't you tell me why?<br> Tell me why.<br> The thing about Smack Daddy is...<br> - Who?|- Smack Daddy.<br> Have I ever heard of|Smack Daddy?<br> He's a black singer, Dad.|You wouldn't know him.<br> Oh, no, I never heard of...|James Brown or Barry White,<br> or Puffy the Dog.<br> - May I finish?|- Please.<br> The thing about Smack Daddy is,|you know with him,<br> it's no one-night stand,|that it's forever.<br> Millions want him,<br> but it's as if|he's only singin' to me... baby.<br> Age doesn't matter.<br> He doesn't care that I'm old|and sick and falling apart.<br> He sees my soul. He's not fickle.<br> - He's there for me.|- Like Dad?<br> Well, your father can't sing.<br> But Smack Daddy...|man alive, is he sexy, which...<br> it does lead|to this whole sexual thing.<br> I mean, it...<br> does bring up|some sort of nice memories.<br> - You mean with Dad, right?|- Him, too.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> - What?|- Hello. It's you.<br> I was knocking on a lot of doors|looking for you.<br> Yours was ajar.<br> Come in.|How's it goin'?<br> No foreseeable problems.<br> I was about to check|your turkey myself.<br> Then I thought,|since it's yours,<br> maybe you'd prefer|to do the checking.<br> I certainly could do it for you,|and will, if you'd like.<br> Didn't want to presume...<br> That's fine, whatever.<br> It's a common misconception<br> that you can just|stick a turkey in the oven.<br> Turkey needs to be tended to,|he needs to be cared for lovingly.<br> One must pay|close attention to poultry.<br> Sure.<br> So much can go wrong.<br> A turkey can burn in places,|be overcooked, undercooked...<br> which is a health hazard...|and what about basting?<br> Look, Wayne,|I'll be up in a second, okay?<br> The second's up.<br> Just give me a minute.<br> Tick-tock.<br> Tick-tock.<br> - Wait. Here I come.|- I don't think so.<br> Bernadette has a small bladder,|and if I don't get her outside...<br> - Can't I just pop my head in?|- I'm afraid not.<br> - I'll be real quick.|- No.<br> Do you know that good feeling|that often comes from being helpful?<br> - Yes.|- I'm not having that feeling here.<br> Look, I'm sorry. I didn't realize...<br> So I ask myself,<br> "Wayne, it's very clear|what you're doing for her,<br> but what are you|getting out of this?"<br> I think you need to take|some time and think about that,<br> so that maybe later,|you help me understand<br> what I'm getting from this exchange...|if we can even call it an exchange.<br> Come along, Bernadette.<br> All crap, Latrell!<br> Keep lookin'!<br> These are pimp clothes, man!<br> - Money green.|- No!<br> - Lapel surprise.|- No!<br> - Velvet.|- Hell, no! No!<br> How am I supposed to wear this?<br> Big man... look, I was savin'|this little number for myself,<br> but I think|it's more your size, try that.<br> What do you have there?<br> These are some photos|I've taken of Mom, before and now.<br> - How nice.|- I got a camera for my birthday.<br> Timmy is very talented.<br> - All of our children are talented.|- Yes, Beth's talented, too.<br> Oh, how nice.<br> Maybe this isn't the best time.<br> - This was before.|- So I could remember them always.<br> - Okay, that's enough.|- I think so.<br> There's one more|I want to show you.<br> Where's that one?<br> This is my favorite.<br> Look how the light and...<br> ...how the arm is.<br> I think I prefer Beth's singing.<br> Wayne?<br> Hey, you ever hear the phrase...<br> "Beware the occasion|that warrants a new suit"?<br> - Nope.|- I'm tellin' you, beware.<br> You never been in love.<br> I never been in love, and I don't want|to be in love, thank you.<br> It does things to you.<br> Like what?<br> You do things you thought|you never could ever do.<br> - My mama, God rest her soul...|- Lord, not another mama story!<br> - She was drivin'.|- Your mama can't drive.<br> You didn't even know my mother,|and I pity you for that.<br> You don't have to pity me.|You the one in love.<br> Anyway, my mother was drivin',|and I was just a baby.<br> The car flipped over, and I|was trapped underneath the car.<br> You know what she did?|She lifted up the car.<br> - Bullshit.|- I'm tellin' you.<br> She lifted up the car,|and she pulled me to safety.<br> She had this moment|of unbelievable strength,<br> 'cause she had love.<br> That's what love does.<br> - Bravo, bravo!|- Encore, encore!<br> - Any requests?|- That you stop.<br> I'm sorry. I'm terrible.<br> Who are you?<br> Don't start with that.|You know who I am.<br> I know who you say you are,<br> but my daughter is kind|and sweet and soft-spoken.<br> Not anymore.<br> Then I don't know you.<br> Oh, shit!<br> Joy, honey, are you all right?<br> I am so critical.<br> It's one of my worst faults,<br> and some of the reasons|for this are obvious.<br> But why, I keep asking myself,<br> why am I so hard,|for instance, on you, Beth,<br> when, for years, you've been|the daughter of my dreams?<br> You have. You know you have.<br> Apart from your weight problems,|we're practically the same person.<br> So why am I so hard on you?<br> Forget the fact that you're|making the same mistakes I made,<br> and I wish you'd make your own.<br> But I think I'm hard on you because|we've had so many good times.<br> And I think it's likely,|as this gets worse, Timmy,<br> I'll be hard on you, too, because|we've had so many good times.<br> So then, why am I hard on April|when we didn't have any good times?<br> That's not true, though.<br> For days, I've been trying|to think of nice April memories,<br> and I can only come up with one.<br> One vivid, beautiful memory.|There's gotta be more.<br> - One can be a lot.|- Okay, what was it?<br> It's not important.<br> Like hell, it's not.|Tell us. What was it?<br> Okay, she had just turned three.<br> She was looking out the|picture window on Locust Street,<br> and it was early in the morning,|but it was already sunny.<br> She was just gazing out the window,|and she turned back to me,<br> and she said, "Oh, Mother,|don't you just love every day?"<br> That was me.<br> It was!<br> April was six when|we lived on Locust Street.<br> Is that right?<br> Well, what about the crayon drawing<br> she did of the Mayflower...|the one you had framed?<br> - That was me, too.|- Cut it out!<br> I'm sorry, but it's important|that we're accurate here.<br> - These are my memories, too.|- Are you sure?<br> She's absolutely right,|God freakin' dammit.<br> Just off the top of my head,|I have one.<br> She was... I don't know how old,<br> but she was wearing|a pink nightgown.<br> That was me.<br> - I'm kidding.|- Funny. Very funny.<br> And I was coming back|from a trip, or maybe not,<br> but I came into her room,|and she was sleeping...<br> in her crib, and it was lovely.<br> - That's it?|- Yes, that's it.<br> That's lovely.<br> No, it's not. Your happiest moment?|She was asleep!<br> I didn't say it was|my happiest moment,<br> it's just what came to mind.<br> Joy|Momh?<br> Joy, watch...!<br> - What are you doing?|- It's shitty, Jim.<br> All I can remember|is the petulance,<br> the shoplifting,|the fire in the kitchen.<br> Which was an accident.<br> Was it an accident the way|she used to light matches<br> and throw them at Beth?<br> Or the time she used a lighter|to trim Timmy's bangs?<br> - Joy, come on.|- I mean, the drugs, the ingratitude!<br> She bit my nipples|whenever I tried to breastfeed.<br> Sweetie, come on.<br> No wonder there's cancer.|She's the cancer.<br> Get back in the...<br> Get back in the car!<br> Stop! Stop!<br> What's going on?<br> Mom needed to stretch her legs.<br> Joy, stop. Stop!<br> I tried, okay,|but I can't go, I can't.<br> I can't... I can't have|another bad experience with her.<br> - It won't be like that.|- You don't know that.<br> It's the whole point of going.<br> We're making a memory.<br> You're not listening to me.|I have too many memories!<br> A good memory.|We're making something good.<br> What if it's not?<br> It will be. I promise.<br> I promise it will be beautiful.<br> How do you know?<br> Because I told her it had to be.<br> And if it's not?<br> Then I'll kill her.<br> Wayne!<br> Hi. I'd like to report a kidnapping.<br> I said I'd like to report|a kidnapping.<br> This man who lives|in my apartment building,<br> he's taken my turkey hostage,<br> and he's had it for|over an hour now, and I can't...<br> My turkey.<br> Turkey.
