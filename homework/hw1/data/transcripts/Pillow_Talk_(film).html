Maybe<br> she's got a party line.<br> I hope you understand,<br> madam,<br> that your phone company wants<br> everyone to have a private phone.<br> We're putting in new trunk<br> lines as fast as we can.<br> But with all the construction<br> going on, it takes time.<br> We have hundreds<br> of applications,<br> which take precedence<br> over yours.<br> But there must be<br> some way to get one.<br> Well, if some emergency arose.<br> If you were to become<br> pregnant, for example,<br> why, you'd jump right<br> to the top of our list.<br> Mr. Conrad, being single, I'm not quite<br> ready for that kind of emergency.<br> Well, I wouldn't know<br> what else to suggest.<br> Oh, but I'm at my<br> wit's end, really.<br> You see, I'm an<br> interior decorator<br> and I do a lot<br> of work at home,<br> and so naturally there are<br> business calls that I must make<br> and I cannot get<br> a call through.<br> That man is always on the<br> phone with some woman.<br> Have you any idea<br> what it's like<br> to be on a party line<br> with a sex maniac?<br> That's a very serious<br> charge, madam.<br> Can you substantiate it?<br> Well, he sings love songs<br> at 9:00 in the morning.<br> Has he used objectionable<br> language on the phone?<br> No.<br> Or threats of any nature?<br> No.<br> Has he made immoral<br> overtures to you?<br> Well. Oh, not to me.<br> And you're bothered<br> by this?<br> Yes.<br> I mean, no. What do<br> you mean, bothered?<br> His carrying on with all these<br> other women disturbs you.<br> Mr. Conrad, please believe me,<br> I don't care what he does,<br> I just want him to stop<br> doing it on my phone.<br> Well, madam, we'll have one<br> of our inspectors stop by<br> and have a talk with him.<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> I'd appreciate that.<br> If what you say<br> about this man is true,<br> we may be forced<br> to disconnect him.<br> Good.<br> Haven't you reached<br> Jan yet?<br> [BUSY SIGNAL]<br> Keep trying.<br> If she doesn't<br> get here soon,<br> that woman is going to<br> drive me out of my mind.<br> Ming dynasty in a rumpus room.<br> [GASPS]<br> Mrs. Walters, be careful.<br> This is priceless.<br> Really? What is it?<br> A 14th-century<br> crematory urn.<br> Crematory urn?<br> Is anybody in it?<br> Not at the moment.<br> That's good.<br> Then we can drill a hole in the<br> bottom without anyone running out.<br> A hole?<br> So we can wire it<br> for a lamp.<br> Mrs. Walters, we do not wire<br> I suppose not.<br> JONATHAN: Jan.<br> Jan.<br> Hello, Jonathan.<br> Hi. I've got something<br> to tell you.<br> Oh? I was trying to<br> call you all morning,<br> but your line's been busy.<br> Oh, naturally.<br> I just drove her out of the showroom.<br> How do you like it?<br> It's marvelous.<br> Like the color?<br> Oh, it's just beautiful.<br> The upholstery?<br> It's yours.<br> Huh?<br> In grateful appreciation<br> of the very brilliant job<br> you've been doing<br> on my office.<br> What? Jonathan.<br> Jonathan, you just don't go<br> around giving girls cars.<br> I do.<br> This your car, Mac?<br> No, it's hers.<br> Oh!<br> Is this your car, Miss?<br> No, it's his.<br> Jonathan. Jonathan, you're<br> very sweet and very generous,<br> but I cannot accept<br> a gift like this.<br> Why not?<br> But... Well, it's too...<br> It's too personal.<br> This?<br> Yes.<br> If I gave you perfume, if I gave you<br> lingerie, that would be personal.<br> But a car?<br> Come on, Mac.<br> If it's yours, move it.<br> Here. Send me<br> the perfume.<br> Will you be stopping by<br> my office tomorrow?<br> In the afternoon.<br> Listen.<br> Are you sure you<br> don't want the car?<br> Yes, I'm sure, Jonathan.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> My analyst will<br> never believe this.<br> Neither will mine.<br> Good morning.<br> Oh.<br> Mrs. Walters,<br> I'm sorry to be so late.<br> That's all right, dear.<br> Mr. Pierot and I had a very fruitful morning.<br> Didn't we, Mr. P?<br> Very fruitful.<br> Good.<br> Well, what are you<br> doing with that?<br> I picked it out myself.<br> I thought it would<br> go wonderfully well...<br> Mrs. Walters,<br> a fertility goddess<br> is the last thing<br> you need in Scarsdale.<br> A fertility goddess?<br> My dear, I had no idea.<br> Now, don't forget,<br> I'm expecting you both<br> at the housewarming<br> tomorrow evening.<br> We'll be there.<br> Savage little thing,<br> isn't it?<br> That woman has the taste<br> of a water buffalo.<br> Well, then why do<br> business with her?<br> Well, because she happens to<br> be a very rich water buffalo.<br> [CHUCKLES]<br> But if you ever leave me<br> alone with her again...<br> Where were you? I tried<br> to reach you all morning.<br> Oh, lover boy got started<br> very early today.<br> Oh, really, Jan, there must be<br> some way to get a private line.<br> Tell them it's an emergency.<br> Thank you, Mr. P.<br> I've reported him<br> to the phone company.<br> Well, it's about time.<br> They're sending<br> an inspector over.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> whatever Mr. Allen gets,<br> he has coming to him.<br> [CHUCKLING] Good.<br> [DOORBELL BUZZES]<br> Mr. Allen, I'm from<br> the telephone company.<br> Well, hello.<br> I...<br> I'm...<br> Yes?<br> I'm Miss Dickenson.<br> I'm an inspector.<br> What would you<br> like to inspect?<br> You. I mean, we've received<br> a complaint about you.<br> Well, I've never had<br> any complaints before.<br> Won't you come in?<br> Why, thank you.<br> You don't have to break the<br> sound barrier, you hot-rodder.<br> Alm?<br> Well, I heard from<br> the phone company.<br> I'm the one who can't get a call<br> through, and they sent me this.<br> Listen, "Your complaint<br> has been found<br> "to be completely<br> unwarranted and untruthful.<br> "According to our inspector,<br> Miss Dickenson..."<br> Would you believe that?<br> They sent a woman.<br> It's like sending a marshmallow<br> to put out a bonfire.<br> Here, read it for yourself.<br> You know I never get<br> into focus until 10:00.<br> "Our inspector found Mr. Allen<br> to be extremely cooperative."<br> I'll just bet he was.<br> [PHONE RINGS]<br> Hello?<br> Miss Morrow?<br> My name is Brad Allen.<br> Yes?<br> I've been advised<br> by the phone company<br> that there's a code number<br> for our party line.<br> It's 793.<br> Now, if you have any<br> future complaints to make,<br> I suggest you dial it and<br> complain to me personally.<br> Why, Mr. Allen,<br> if I hadn't complained,<br> the inspector would never have<br> found out how cooperative you are.<br> Miss Morrow, why are you so<br> fascinated with my personal affairs?<br> I'm not fascinated,<br> Mr. Allen. Revolted.<br> You don't see me going<br> down to the phone company<br> complaining about<br> your affairs.<br> I have none to<br> complain about.<br> It figures.<br> What do you mean,<br> it figures?<br> Well, obviously.<br> You're a woman who lives<br> alone and doesn't like it.<br> I happen to like<br> living alone.<br> Look, I don't know<br> what's bothering you,<br> but don't take your bedroom<br> problems out on me.<br> I have no bedroom problems.<br> There's nothing in my<br> bedroom that bothers me.<br> Oh, well,<br> that's too bad.<br> Mr. Allen, let's try<br> to be adult about this<br> and work out some<br> sort of schedule<br> where I can make<br> my business calls<br> and you can make your...<br> Whatever you call<br> the calls you make.<br> Now, from the hour to the<br> half-hour, the phone will be yours.<br> From the half-hour to the<br> hour, it will be mine.<br> Should either of us receive a call<br> during the other's half-hour,<br> he or she will terminate the<br> conversation as quickly as possible.<br> In emergencies, each will<br> exercise a little tolerance.<br> How does that sound?<br> Like a report from<br> the United Nations.<br> You mean, you disagree?<br> No, it might work.<br> Well, I hope so.<br> I understand that<br> we're going to have to<br> share this party line<br> for at least<br> another month.<br> We'll just have to try<br> living with one another.<br> Well?<br> I was waiting for you to<br> make some off-color remark.<br> Miss Morrow, is that all<br> you have on your mind?<br> Never mind my mind.<br> You stick to your half-hour<br> and I'll stick to mine.<br> You know, he makes<br> pretty good sense.<br> Were you listening in<br> again?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Alma, have you no shame?<br> No, ma'am,<br> he's brightened up<br> many a dreary<br> afternoon for me.<br> What did he say that<br> made such good sense?<br> If there's anything worse<br> than a woman living alone,<br> it's a woman saying<br> she likes it.<br> Well, I do like it.<br> I have a good job, a lovely apartment,<br> I go out with very nice men<br> to the best places,<br> the theater,<br> the finest restaurants.<br> What am I missing?<br> When you have to ask,<br> believe me,<br> you're missing it.<br> Well, what is a girl<br> supposed to do?<br> Go out on the street and ask<br> the first man she meets<br> to come home with her?<br> No, don't do that, ma'am.<br> it don't work.<br> Bedroom problems.<br> [THINKING]<br> Bedroom problems?<br> Bedroom problems.<br> JAN: Over here, please.<br> Just set it down there.<br> No, the other way.<br> Thank you very much.<br> How's it look?<br> You look beautiful.<br> Oh, Jonathan, now really,<br> do you like it or...<br> Whatever you like, I like.<br> Jan, why won't you<br> marry me?<br> Jonathan,<br> I don't love you.<br> Well, that's absurd.<br> [EXCLAIMS]<br> Well, I'm young,<br> I'm rich, I'm healthy.<br> I'm good-looking.<br> I'm very good-looking.<br> I've got everything.<br> Including three ex-wives.<br> [LAUGHS]<br> on, that's what it is.<br> Jan, please don't<br> hold that against me.<br> Those marriages were just a<br> revolt against my mother.<br> I'm trying to work it out. I'm trying<br> to find out why I dislike her so.<br> I've been talking<br> to this psychiatrist<br> about my mother<br> for two years now.<br> And?<br> It's perfectly healthy.<br> He dislikes her as much as<br> I do and he's from Vienna.<br> [LAUGHS]<br> This time it'll be different, Jan,you'll see.<br> We'll go to Mexico.<br> It'll be like starting<br> from scratch.<br> I've never been<br> married in Mexico.<br> Jonathan, I just don't<br> happen to love you.<br> Well, how do you know?<br> Love isn't an opinion,<br> it's a chemical reaction.<br> We've never even kissed.<br> Well, they didn't hit the moon with<br> the first missile shot either.<br> Oh, Jonathan.<br> I guess that's what I want.<br> To hit the moon.<br> Well...<br> I tell you what.<br> Let's have dinner tonight and then<br> we can try another countdown.<br> Can't do it. I have to go to a<br> housewarming party tonight.<br> One of our clients.<br> Well, I'll call you<br> tomorrow, then.<br> If I can ever get through<br> that busy signal.<br> Oh, call between the half-hour<br> and the hour.<br> How come?<br> I've signed a ceasefire<br> with my party line.<br> Jan, marry me and I'll smother<br> you with private phones.<br> [GIGGLES]<br> I'd better leave.<br> That kind of talk could<br> sweep a girl off her feet.<br> Hi, Alm.<br> Any calls?<br> [SHUSHES]<br> It's him.<br> Mr. Allen,<br> you're on my half-hour.<br> Party pooper.<br> [GIGGLES]<br> [PHONE RINGS]<br> Hello?<br> Don't ever do that again.<br> Mr. Allen,<br> we made an agreement.<br> You were on my time.<br> All right, so I overlapped<br> by a few measly minutes.<br> What am I supposed to do<br> when somebody calls me?<br> Be as rude as you are?<br> Have you anything<br> else to say?<br> Yes.
