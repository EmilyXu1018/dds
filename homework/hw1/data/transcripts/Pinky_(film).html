                        Good morning, ma'am.<br> Sure is a fine day<br> today, isn't it?<br> Getting this washing up.<br> Should've had it up long ago too.<br> If it's Aunt Dicey Johnson you're<br> lookin' for, ma'am, here I be.<br> Pinky?<br> Pinky, child?<br> Yes, Granny.<br> It's... It's me.<br> Pinky. My Pinky.<br> Thank you, Lord, for<br> bringing my child back to me.<br> She'd be such a far piece and long journey,<br> and this be the morning of her return.<br> Amen.<br> Granny.<br> No frettin', honey. 'Cause<br> you're home safe and sound.<br> Come on in and let Granny scare<br> you up a mite of breakfast.<br> Come on.<br> Come on, sugar.<br> Come on.<br> Oh, me. It sure do me good<br> to see you standin' there.<br> Just think. My Pinky baby all growed<br> up and come home to her old granny.<br> How did you know<br> I'd come back?<br> That's why I sent you away,<br> sugar, so you'd come back.<br> Come back and help the<br> sick, the halt and the needy.<br> Remember what I say the<br> day I put you on the train?<br> I said, "Pinky, baby,<br> no matter how far you go<br> "how much you learn, you gotta<br> bring it all back with you.<br> "That's why I'm sending you.<br> Because the Bible say,<br> "A little leaven shall<br> leaven the whole lump. "'<br> Granny...<br> Granny, did you ever think<br> I might wanna stay up north?<br> There's some things we gotta<br> trust the Lord about, Pinky,<br> some things<br> we can't do ourself.<br> We gotta depend on him.<br> Everything just like<br> you left it, sugar.<br> What is it, Pinky?<br> Oh, I wish you'd<br> never sent me away.<br> You mean, you wish you'd growed up<br> ignorant, no-account good-for-nothin'?<br> You wish you'd never learned to read and<br> write and make your way in this world?<br> Oh, no,<br> but don't you see?<br> Yes, Pinky,<br> I do see.<br> Let me say something once<br> and for all and never again.<br> Why is it you write me<br> less and less as time go by?<br> Why is it after you go to the<br> hospital, I get no letter at all?<br> No. You don't need to say<br> nothin'. You think I don't know.<br> You think poor old ignorant woman<br> like me livin' in a shack like this<br> don't know nothin',<br> but you're wrong, Pinky.<br> I do know.<br> And I know what you done.<br> And you know I never told you<br> to pretend you is what you ain't.<br> I didn't mean to, Granny.<br> It just happened.<br> But that's a sin before<br> God, and you know it.<br> It was a conductor on the train. He put<br> me back in another car, the white one.<br> But he knowed who you was.<br> I put you where you belonged.<br> No. No, no.<br> It was after that, when<br> they changed conductors.<br> Then why you ain't tell<br> the new conductor?<br> Granny, I don't know.<br> I was only a child.<br> Then what about school?<br> What about that?<br> Other children talk about<br> their kinfolks, don't they?<br> What you say when they asked you about<br> your'ns? You tell 'em who your granny is?<br> Oh, shame,<br> shame be on you, Pinky.<br> Denying yourself like Peter<br> denied the good Lord Jesus.<br> Here. Get down.<br> Get down.<br> That's where you belong. Now<br> you tell the Lord what you done.<br> Ask his forgiveness<br> on your immortal soul.<br> Come on out and get your breakfast. I<br> don't wanna hear another word from you<br> about what you done again<br> as long as you live.<br> Tom.<br> Tom.<br> Tom, please.<br> Please, Tom.<br> Tom.<br> Tom.<br> Tom!<br> Good morning, honey.<br> You up, I see.<br> Yes, Granny.<br> You do this much<br> every day?<br> Ain't missed a day 'cept the time I was<br> down sick with pneumonia three years ago.<br> Here. I'll help you.<br> I ain't sent you away for you<br> to come back and take in washing.<br> Granny, I was awful glad when<br> you stopped sending me money.<br> What you mean?<br> I didn't want you breaking<br> your back for me forever.<br> Stopped? I ain't never missed<br> once. I give Jake Waters that money,<br> just like I been doin'<br> every week since his pa died.<br> I gotta see Jake about that.<br> Kind of superstitious about him.<br> I'll go see Jake.<br> I'll get it back for you.<br> How much do you get<br> for a wash like this?<br> Oh, they don't count,<br> far as money goes.<br> You mean<br> you're not paid for it?<br> 'Course not.<br> They're Miss Em's.<br> Yeah. I can see<br> it's Miss Em's.<br> You mean to say she<br> doesn't pay you for it?<br> Not in cash money.<br> Miss Em ain't got no cash money.<br> Besides, she's old now, old and sick.<br> She has a house full of<br> valuable antiques, hasn't she?<br> But they're family things.<br> Can't sell them.<br> Besides, why are you<br> so set agin Miss Em?<br> She ain't never hurt you.<br> Look at her house.<br> Slave-built, slave-run<br> and run-down ever since.<br> I went through that gate in her garden<br> once, just once, when I was a little girl.<br> She ordered me out,<br> and I'll never forget it.<br> Oh, Miss Em ain't never liked children<br> traipsin' around in her garden.<br> Why, when she had that boarding<br> school, she made them girls play<br> on the other side<br> of the house.<br> Guess I'll look in on her now like I do<br> every morning to see if she's all right.<br> Tom. Tom.<br> I'll send him a telegram.<br> Western Union.<br> I want to send a telegram.<br> Yes. Straight wire.<br> "Dr. Thomas Adams.<br> "St. Bartholomew's Hospital,<br> Boston.<br> "Darling.<br> All a terrible mistake.<br> "Returning by the first train.<br> "Meet me at the station,<br> please.<br> "I love you, love you,<br> love you, love you. "<br> Get up there. Come on,<br> you lazy devil. Come on.<br> Can you tell me where<br> Jake Waters lives?<br> Right down<br> on the corner.<br> Thank you.<br> Hi, Tommy.<br> Hi.<br> This where<br> Jake Waters lives?<br> Mmm-mmm.<br> You're Jake Waters,<br> aren't you?<br> Uh, yes, ma'am, I am.<br> This is my house here.<br> I'm Patricia Johnson.<br> Who? You know Mrs. Dicey Johnson,<br> don't you? I'm her grandchild.<br> Pinky?<br> Well, what do you know?<br> Come right in, Miss Pinky.<br> I'm mighty glad to see you.<br> Mighty glad. Yes.<br> I've come to get the money my<br> grandmother gave you to send me.<br> Oh, the money!<br> Come on in.<br> I've been tryin' to get over to see your<br> granny, but every time I start over there,<br> something happens<br> to stop me.<br> Yes, sir. Mighty busy<br> these days. Mighty busy.<br> This won't take long.<br> I shan't ask you<br> why you held back the money<br> so long as you return it.<br> Oh, sure, sure. Don't<br> worry about it. Sit down.<br> Oh. You know,<br> you've been away a long time.<br> What about the money?<br> You'll get it. You'll<br> get it. Every cent of it.<br> Sit down.<br> Why'd you come back, Miss Pinky?<br> Never figured that you would.<br> Why shouldn't I?<br> This is my home.<br> Don't give me that,<br> Miss Pinky.<br> Jake's smart. He sees<br> things. Man most likely, huh?<br> White man? Couldn't tell him<br> and couldn't not tell him, huh?<br> Look, Jake,<br> I haven't got all...<br> Of course. Didn't mean<br> to be nosy, Miss Pinky.<br> Jake's your friend.<br> He only wants to help you.<br> Help me by giving me back<br> my grandmother's money.<br> Oh, yes. The money. Well, I<br> never keep much cash money on me.<br> Keep it all in the bank,<br> Miss Pinky.<br> Is it far to the bank?<br> Bank's closed today.<br> Saturday.<br> Very well. You can give me<br> whatever you have on hand<br> and I'll tell my grandmother<br> you'll pay her the rest on Monday.<br> Of course, I never keep<br> much money around the house.<br> Mind giving me<br> what you have?<br> Just a minute.<br> I'll look around.<br> This every bit of money I got in the<br> house. A ten and a five makes $15.<br> I'll tell my grandmother you'll<br> give her the rest on Monday.<br> Monday. Sure. You be<br> sure and come by Monday.<br> I'll be there, all right.<br> Jake, what's she doin'<br> with my money?<br> Rozelia, you know I didn't...<br> What you doin' with my money?<br> Rozelia, you know who that<br> is? Miss Pinky. I don't care.<br> Miss Pinky, that happens to be my money.<br> Let go of me!<br> Come high, don't you?<br> Drop that.<br> Why, you... I'll split you open<br> if you don't give me my money.<br> Hey there. What's up?<br> What's goin' on here?<br> Nothin' at all, Captain.<br> Everything's<br> all right now.<br> They been botherin'<br> you, ma'am?<br> Pull your dress up, girl.<br> Got a knife, Chief.<br> Okay. Get it.<br> Well, I reckon it's just as<br> well we come up when we did.<br> Uh, just what<br> was the trouble, ma'am?<br> I don't care<br> to make any charges.<br> Just a minute,<br> if you please.<br> I reckon you're a stranger in this part<br> of the country, but this fella Jake,<br> did he molest you<br> in any way, ma'am?<br> No. No.<br> And the girl.<br> What about her, ma'am?<br> She even so much as thought of<br> threatening you, we wanna know about it,<br> or if she give you<br> any of her impudence.<br> Shut up, girl.<br> Excuse me, sir, but why are you<br> two white men "ma'am-ing" her?<br> She's nothin' but<br> a low-down colored gal.<br> Tried to steal my man.<br> Make him stop!<br> Make him stop!<br> You heard what she said. He's got<br> to slap her down, unless it's true.<br> Yes, it's true. I'm colored. My<br> grandmother's Mrs. Dicey Johnson.<br> Mrs. Dicey Johnson! I oughta<br> slap 'em both down, Chief.<br> Nah. Hold it.<br> Why, I think I'll be going now. Go?<br> You ain't goin' anywhere till<br> I tell you. Get in that car.<br> I'm under arrest?<br> What do you think? On what<br> charges are you holding me?<br> You heard what I said.<br> Get in that car.<br> Don't worry. I'll fix<br> it. I know the judge.<br> Let me handle this.<br> It looked like there was gonna be<br> some trouble, and I searched her.<br> Then I took this knife off her,<br> Judge Walker. It was in her garter.<br> So I just brought 'em all in.<br> Is this your knife?<br> She's the one started trouble,<br> comin' takin' my money.<br> That'll do. Find<br> anything on the other one?<br> Didn't search her.<br> Nothin' there, Judge.<br> She had plenty time<br> to throw it away.<br> Rozelia, I could send you<br> up for this knife business.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And I will if I hear one<br> more word about this matter<br> about a knife<br> or razor or any trouble.<br> Is that clear?<br> Yes.<br> Now, go.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> As for you, Jake...<br> Yes, sir. I was just...<br> You've been in this<br> kind of trouble before.<br> After this, keep your hands<br> off other people's money.<br> No, sir. Never touch a<br> nickel that ain't mine, sir.<br> I'm going to let you<br> off this time.<br> Thank you.<br> Much obliged, Judge.<br> But next time<br> will be the last.<br> Yes, sir. Thank you.<br> Now it's to you, Pinky.<br> If Jake owes you money and<br> doesn't pay it, let me know.<br> I'll see that he does.<br> Thank you.<br> I remember years ago,<br> after your mother died.<br> I remember when Dicey sent you away<br> to school. Aunt Dicey's a good woman.<br> I've always thought<br> highly of her,<br> and I'd like to be able to<br> think well of her grandchildren.<br> I've done nothing, Judge Walker,<br> and I'm telling you the truth.<br> I'm not saying<br> you aren't, but...<br> But because I'm colored,<br> you don't believe me.<br> You're not sure.<br> That's it, isn't it?<br> How'd you make out up yonder?<br> I graduated, then I took three<br> years' training as a nurse.<br> Oh, I didn't know. You managed to<br> do all that on what Dicey could send?<br> Yes.<br> Hmm.<br> I won scholarships. I worked,<br> waited tables. I got along.<br> Oh, that's good. That's very<br> good. All the more reason<br> you should keep on being a credit<br> and comfort to your grandmother.<br> You've had advantages which are<br> denied to most members of your race,<br> people like Jake<br> and Rozelia, for example.<br> Just try to keep out<br> of trouble. That's all.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Pinky.<br> Yes, Granny?<br> Why don't you try and...<br> Going somewhere, honey?<br> Just for a walk.<br> Evenin',<br> Sister Johnson.<br> Come in, Jake.<br> Stop sneakin' in here<br> behind me like that too.<br> I told Miss Pinky I'd drop around,<br> so here I is, man of my word.<br> Good. Pinky give me the $15 you give her,<br> said you'd be here to give me the rest.<br> I guess she was kind of riled<br> after that little run-in.<br> Run-in?<br> What you mean, run-in?<br> Oh, nothing.<br> You workin' mighty<br> late, Sister Johnson.<br> Oh, I reckon I'll die<br> with the shoes on my feet and that old<br> smoothin' iron in my hand, good Lord willing.<br> You're a worker from way<br> back yonder. Yes, sir.<br> I always admire<br> a good worker.<br> Look who's talkin'.<br> Well, there's work and then there's<br> work. My biggest work, I do with my brain.<br> Liable to get top-heavy<br> overworking that brain, eh, Jake?<br> That's the way to rise up in the world.<br> No more being the skim milk for Jake.<br> He's gonna be<br> the cream on top.<br> Cream gotta be cream<br> first before it rise.<br> Where you goin', Sister?<br> I gotta take this wash<br> back to Miss Em's.<br> Oh.<br> Give me that.<br> Don't you want me<br> to read it for ya?<br> Give it back,<br> I say. It's mine.<br> I can see...<br> I can see that.<br> Give me that letter!<br> Not gonna read<br> this letter to nobody.<br> Well, you burned it up, didn't<br> you? That ain't gonna stop nothin'.<br> I got a feeling that a fast letter coming<br> like that is a shadow moving before.<br> Think so, Jake?<br> Folks is coming, they come<br> treadin' on their shadows.<br> Course, I can stop him. Got his name<br> and address right here in my head.<br> Didn't I tell you I worked with my<br> brain? I can write a letter to him.<br> Say, I never seen no<br> colored man write like that.<br> Two stamps on the letter and his name and<br> address in the corner with "M. D." after it.<br> That means doctor.<br> You think you'd<br> be doing right?<br> You wanna keep Miss Pinky, don't<br> you? I'll send him a telegram.<br> That'll stop him<br> just like that.<br> Don't you worry, Sister. Jake's<br> gonna take care of everything.<br> Course, telegrams cost money, and I<br> like to do everything business-like.<br> That'll be a deductible item<br> from what I owe you.<br> Evenin', ma'am.<br> Can we give you a lift?<br> No, thank you.<br> Excuse me, ma'am. You must be a stranger<br> around here. We can't let no white girl<br> walk by herself through<br> this here nigger section.<br> I live in this section.<br> You what?<br> I said I live here.<br> Now, just let me alone.<br> Lives here?<br> What do you know?<br> Who'd ever figure that?<br> That's the whitest<br> dinge I ever saw.<br> Look at that<br> swamp rabbit go.<br> What do you say,<br> let's go get her?<br> Boy, let's go now.<br> We ain't gonna hurt you, baby. Don't be<br> afraid, baby. We ain't gonna hurt you.<br> We just wanna have<br> a little fun, baby.<br> Take it easy.<br> Come here, honey.<br> No! No! Stop! Stop!<br> Please! Don't! Don't!<br> What a build on her.<br> Let's see your face, baby.<br> Hold up your face.<br> Oh, you're pretty. You're<br> pretty. You're real pretty.<br> What's the matter, baby?<br> You want a drink?<br> Hey, Al,<br> give me that bottle.<br> Come back here, gal!<br> Come on back here, gal!<br> Ah, let her go.<br> Pinky? Pinky?<br> Pinky?<br> Granny?<br> Yes.<br> What you got<br> the door locked for?<br> Granny, what is it?<br> What's wrong?<br> Tell me, Granny.<br> It's Miss Em.<br> Miss Em, honey.<br> What's the matter with her?<br> Oh, Doc Joe say<br> it's her heart again.<br> Her heart give out.<br> It happened while I was<br> puttin' the linen in the closet,<br> talkin' to her<br> when she took her spell.<br> So I run down to the corner<br> fast as I could, phoned Doc Joe.<br> He picked me up on the way<br> back. He come that fast.<br> Her heart?<br> How old is she?<br> Oh, a year or two older<br> than me maybe.<br> Course, she never<br> allow that to my face.<br> Lord, I kinda hoped you'd take<br> me before you took Miss Em.<br> I kinda hoped you would.<br> Thy will be done.<br> Everyone has to die, Granny.<br> You're right, baby,<br> but the least we can do<br> is ease their passin'.<br> I'm so glad you're here. Seems like the<br> Lord sent you here out of pure goodness.<br> Me?<br> I say, "Doc Joe... "<br> I say, "Never you mind. "<br> And was I proud to say it.<br> I say, "Never you mind, sir.<br> "My Pinky's here,<br> and she's a good nurse. "<br> So he's sittin' there<br> waitin' for you right now.<br> You told him<br> I'd nurse her?<br> Course, honey. Doc Joe say<br> everything depend on good nursing.<br> He say she gotta<br> have a trained nurse,<br> and he can't lay his hand<br> on one for love or money,<br> if Miss Em had the money,<br> which she ain't.<br> Then tell him to keep right<br> on looking. I'm not interested.<br> But she'll die.<br> Then let her die.<br> Pinky!<br> I didn't mean that, but, Granny,<br> try to understand my side.<br> I only came back here because<br> I hadn't anywhere else to go.<br> I'd forgotten<br> what it was like.<br> I've been away a long time.<br> I've known another kind of life.<br> I've been treated like a human being.<br> Try to understand, like an equal.<br> Don't you see I can't go back into that<br> house? Haven't I had enough without that?<br> Pinky.<br> I worked long and hard<br> to give you an education,<br> and if they done educated<br> the very heart out you,<br> everything I've worked and<br> slaved so hard for is wrong.<br> Now, hear me! You're<br> goin' up to Miss Em's!<br> You're gonna take good care<br> of her, like the nurse you is,<br> or I swear on the Holy Bible, I'll<br> rip the livin' daylights out you!<br> Yes. I'm going away. I should<br> never have come back here.<br> Here. Let me help you.<br> Kind of wrinkled. Reckon I'd<br> better run the smoothin' iron<br> over it before<br> you pack it.<br> Kind of pretty too. Must take a heap<br> of studying, learning to be a nurse.<br> The course is three years,<br> as you know.<br> Miss Em didn't have<br> no training at all.<br> Why should she?<br> Her kind never<br> learns anything useful.<br> Didn't stop her from nursing me, though,<br> when I was down sick with<br> pneumonia, fixin' to die.<br> Miss Em nursed you?<br> I'd like to see that.<br> Where you been living, child? What<br> sort of stuff they teach you up yonder?<br> Have I put in all my work on you for you to<br> turn out to be nothin' but low-down trash?<br> Yes, Pinky.<br> Miss Em did nurse me.<br> If you don't believe me,<br> ask Doc Joe.<br> Miss Em stay here,<br> sleep in your little room.<br> She cook for me, feed me with a<br> spoon, wash my poor, tired body.<br> Even emptied my slops like<br> she was my loving servant.<br> Now she's fixin' to die<br> and my own grandchild done<br> hardened her heart agin her.<br> Doctor.<br> Oh, yes. Glad you could come.<br> She's at pretty low ebb.<br> Under the hypo right now.<br> No fear of disturbing her.<br> Oh, yes. Pinky, isn't it?<br> A nurse. Of course.<br> Your granny's talked a lot about<br> you, but I didn't realize that...<br> Uh, some things I've<br> jotted down here for you.<br> Really not very much<br> we can do right now.<br> She's reached the age where the<br> mechanism begins to slow down.<br> If she has another attack...<br> Have you ever given a hypo?<br> I'm a graduate nurse.<br> Yes, yes, of course.<br> Well, I'm very glad to leave<br> Miss Em with a graduate nurse.<br> No phone in this house, and<br> I'm pretty hard to get hold of,<br> so it'll be a matter<br> of using your own judgment.<br> I understand, Doctor.<br> Your hat.<br> Oh, no. Here.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> You know, of course, that Miss Em<br> can't afford to pay for a trained nurse.<br> Or do you?<br> I know, Doctor.<br> Might be some of her old<br> pupils could pay you something.<br> Most of them still live...<br> No, Doctor. It isn't<br> a question of money.<br> I'm doing it for<br> my grandmother.<br> Well, I'll look in<br> tomorrow afternoon.<br> Good night, Doctor.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm your nurse.<br> Dicey's girl, Pinky,<br> aren't you?<br> Yes.<br> Why didn't you say so?<br> Come over here<br> and let me see you.<br> You didn't call yourself Pinky when<br> you were off up yonder, did you?<br> No.<br> Speak up.<br> What name did you go by?<br> Patricia.<br> Pinky's better.<br> What are you doing there?<br> Dr. McGill left<br> some pills for you.<br> You didn't think I'm gonna take any<br> more of Joe McGill's stupid dope?<br> They'll relieve the pain,<br> Miss Em. You are in pain?<br> Course I'm in pain.<br> What do you think?<br> That you die in<br> ease and ecstasy?<br> What's this thing<br> on my feet?<br> Hot water bottle.<br> Take it away.<br> I won't have it.<br> Brick's much better.<br> Over there on the hearth.<br> Put it in the embers.<br> Go to the wardrobe.<br> Open the door.<br> Look on the second shelf. You'll find<br> a bit of blanket to cover the brick.<br> Take your hands out of there.<br> I said the second shelf.<br> Miss Em, I'm not dishonest,<br> if that's what you're implying.<br> Furthermore,<br> I don't have to...<br> Miss Em?<br> Miss Em!<br> Miss Em.<br> Now, make tracks, y'all. Don't<br> wanna see hide nor hair of ya<br> till tomorrow.<br> That you, Pinky honey?<br> Yes, Granny.<br> Miss Em ain't...<br> No. She's better.<br> Praise the Lord.<br> Dr. Joe's with her now. He said for<br> me to come on down and get some rest.<br> You're supposed to sit with her<br> for the rest of the afternoon.<br> Then you get<br> some sleep, honey.<br> I don't feel like sleeping.<br> What you doing<br> with my clothes?<br> With you being so busy and all,<br> I reckoned I'd unpack for you.<br> Put them back. They can<br> stay packed till I leave.<br> It's only a matter<br> of a few days, at the most.<br> Doc Joe say that?<br> A few days?<br> I can see for myself. Oh, for heaven's<br> sake, Granny, it's only a mean old woman.<br> She's been driving me and nagging me<br> ever since she woke up this morning.<br> She do that?<br> That's good.<br> What's good about it?<br> Then she do feel better,<br> sure enough.<br> Miss Em start feelin' better,<br> the more "coniferous" she act.<br> Pay no attention to her worrisome ways,<br> sugar. She don't mean nothin' by it.<br> She means to put me in<br> my place and keep me there<br> just as she's kept you<br> all these years.<br> Oh, Pinky child, when folks is real<br> friends, there ain't no such thing as place.<br> Hello?<br> Anybody home?<br> Miss Johnson?<br> I beg your pardon.<br> You're Miss Pinky Johnson?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You're looking for me?<br> I'm Dr. Canady from<br> over in Leesburg.<br> How do you do, Doctor?<br> My wife and I heard you were here. We'd<br> like you to come over to the house to dinner.<br> Well, that's... If you'll just set<br> the date, any night that's convenient.<br> I'm on a case now, and<br> after that, I'm going away.<br> When you come back then. Your being here<br> is the best news we had in a long time.<br> We had some girls over in<br> Leesburg, high school graduates,<br> with no chance<br> for regular training.<br> With your help, we can set<br> up a real nursing school.<br> It's out of the question.<br> You see. Excuse me. How are<br> you and your family these days?<br> Fine, thank you,<br> Aunt Dicey.<br> You see, I...<br> I'm not planning<br> to come back.<br> I see. I have<br> never been north.<br> I took my M. D. At Meharry.<br> I was tempted to go, of course,<br> but I felt my job was here.<br> These girls I was telling you about, it's<br> gonna be kind of hard to disappoint them.<br> I'm sorry, but my plans are all made.<br> Well, good luck<br> to you, Miss Johnson.<br> Get the feet.<br> Mind that candlestick.<br> My great-grandfather bought that when<br> they sold Thomas Jefferson's things.<br> Things. Hmm. They last<br> longer than people.<br> This furniture was made<br> to present to Henry Clay<br> if he was elected, but the<br> voters thought different,<br> and Grandfather<br> bought it at auction.<br> Look what you've done.<br> My best brooch.<br> Well, you've looked<br> at it long enough.<br> What do you think of it?<br> It's very nice,<br> Miss Em.<br> Don't be evasive. I want the<br> truth. What do you think of it?<br> It's one of those<br> rather clever imitations<br> one can buy in the chain<br> stores for a dollar.<br> Ninety-eight cents.<br> Any fool would know that.<br> Now, go dust that center table.<br> Bring me a pitcher of water.<br> Miss Em, I've already done<br> those things, and you know it.<br> Don't be impudent. It isn't<br> impudent to say what's true.<br> I'm a trained nurse, and I<br> won't be spoken to like that.<br> You don't like it here,<br> why did you come?<br> Because my grandmother said<br> she'd whip the living<br> daylights out of me if I didn't.<br> That Dicey. Nobody like her.<br> Did she really say that?<br> That's the sort of answer<br> you want to hear, isn't it?<br> No.<br> I prefer the truth.<br> You forgot that fire screen.<br> Don't be so upset.<br> I'll be dead soon<br> and you'll be free<br> to go back north again.<br> Going to give up your nursing<br> when you get back up yonder?<br> Nursing's my profession. In certain<br> places, a nurse is treated with respect.<br> Nobody deserves respect as long as<br> she pretends to be something she isn't.<br> How I live my life<br> is my own business, Miss Em.<br> Course it is. It isn't your<br> husband's business or your children's.<br> You can go now, Pinky. I'll be all<br> right till your grandmother comes.<br> You can't dismiss me as you did when I was<br> a child and you drove me out of your garden.<br> Oh, you remember.<br> Yes. Very clearly.<br> What do you want me to do, stay here and<br> live this sort of life when I don't have to?<br> Just prove you're addicted to<br> the truth, like you pretend.<br> Wherever you are,<br> be yourself.<br> What am I then? You tell me. You're the<br> ones that set the standards, you whites.<br> You're the ones that judge people<br> by the color of their skins.<br> By your own standards,<br> by the only ones that matter<br> to you, I'm as white as you are.<br> That's why you all hate me. What should<br> I do? Dye my face? Grovel and shuffle?<br> Say "yes'm" and "no'm"?<br> Marry some man like Jake Waters?<br> Carry a razor in my stocking?<br> Nobody hates you, Pinky.<br> Don't just stand there. When<br> you leave the room, go quickly.<br> I hate dawdling.<br> Pat!<br> Oh, darling. Oh, if you only knew<br> what I went through finding you.<br> What's wrong? What got into<br> you, running off like that?<br> How did you find me?<br> I got your old address<br> from the nuns' school,<br> and then that crazy telegram<br> came, signed Pinky Johnson.<br> Why "Pinky"?<br> I didn't send you any wire.<br> Come on. Come on up to the house.<br> What's it all about, Pat? I can<br> see you're working, but why here?<br> Why didn't you want me to know?<br> What are you doing, charity work?<br> No. I live here.<br> Is that it?<br> Is it because you were ashamed of<br> telling me you lived in a place like this?<br> I often wondered why you never spoke<br> about your home and family, but...<br> Don't you know who lives<br> in this kind of house?<br> Come on in.<br> Come here, Tom.<br> There's an old colored woman<br> who can't read or write,<br> a washerwoman people<br> around here call Aunt Dicey.<br> There's the basket she carries her<br> clothes in. There's the ironing board.<br> And those are the heavy irons<br> she heats on that old wood stove.<br> Year in and year out,<br> she's washed and ironed<br> and carried her clean clothes<br> to people's back doors,<br> through rain and cold<br> and the heat of summer.<br> And she saved her money and lived<br> on scraps white people gave her.<br> Why? For me. So she could<br> send me off to school,<br> so I could learn<br> to be a nurse.<br> So her granddaughter would be spared<br> the kind of life she's had to live.<br> Her granddaughter?<br> Yes. Her granddaughter.<br> Me.<br> Now you understand.<br> Pat...<br> My name is Pinky.<br> She's coming.<br> Tom, please, please go.<br> I don't want her to find you<br> here. I've got a car. We'll drive.<br> No. No. Not until you tell me<br> the whole story. Come on, Pat.<br> And then, that day at the hospital,<br> I met you for the first time.<br> At first, I tried to keep you away,<br> even to the point of being rude.<br> That's true, isn't it?<br> Remember?<br> But you wouldn't give up.<br> I thought I could take the chance<br> of seeing you, being with you.<br> I'd never been in love. I never<br> dreamed it would ever be serious.<br> When I found it was, a kind of<br> daring came over me, with your love.<br> So I thought<br> I could have everything.<br> For a few weeks<br> I believed it,<br> until you wanted<br> to get married right away.<br> Remember? You said I'd have<br> to make up my mind sometime.<br> Then I realized what my<br> decision would have to be.<br> So I ran.<br> Poor Pat...<br> I'm not looking for pity, and<br> don't tell me it doesn't matter.<br> I couldn't stand that.<br> I won't lie to you.<br> Of course it matters.<br> It makes... Makes problems,<br> important problems.<br> But let's try and face<br> them like rational people.<br> Rational.<br> What's rational<br> about prejudice?<br> I don't think I'm prejudiced. I'm a<br> doctor and I hope enough of a scientist<br> not to believe in the mythology<br> of superior and inferior races.<br> It is a tricky<br> business, though.<br> You never know what exists<br> deep down inside yourself.<br> I want to be absolutely sure nothing<br> like that exists inside of me.<br> You'd be so easy<br> to hurt, Pat.<br> In this case, too much kindness<br> could easily be misunderstood<br> and hurt worse<br> than cruelty.<br> A man should be able to lose<br> his temper and cuss out his wife<br> once in a while without her<br> misunderstanding the reason.<br> That's why I didn't give way to<br> my impulse when you first told me.<br> I wanted to sort of hold myself under<br> a microscope a little bit longer,<br> till I could be sure<br> I was right.<br> What do you mean?<br> I've got two reservations<br> on the plane from Birmingham.<br> I don't know.<br> Come on, Pat. We've got<br> an hour to catch our train.<br> No, no. Wait. Wait.<br> Darling, I love you.<br> Tom, we can't... Wait...<br> I couldn't help myself, even if I<br> wanted to. I don't know. I don't...<br> That's the important thing. The rest<br> of it we can work out between ourselves.<br> It'll be our secret. Nobody<br> else will ever know it.<br> Here.<br> Come on. We'll stop at your<br> house and pick up your things.<br> Tom, I can't go<br> with you now.<br> Why not?<br> Not now. I'm on a case.<br> Let them get<br> somebody else.<br> This isn't just a case. It's<br> a debt that has to be repaid.<br> That's the true reason? Oh, I swear<br> it is. I'm through with running away.<br> You're being honest? You promise<br> you'll come as soon as you can?<br> I'll take the next train.<br> If you don't, I'll be<br> here wanting to know why.<br> Oh, I will!<br> George,<br> you still drive too fast.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Well, shut off the engine.<br> About time.<br> Oh, so you're the one.<br> I'd heard you were light,<br> but I'd no idea you were...<br> Well, you're<br> practically white.<br> What is it that you want,<br> please, ma'am?<br> I'm here to see Miss Emma.<br> I'm sorry. She's not<br> supposed to receive visitors.<br> I'm her cousin,<br> Mrs. Wooley.<br> Oh, yes, Mrs. Wooley.<br> Well, if you'll wait down here,<br> I'll see if Miss Em can see you.<br> How is she?<br> She's improving. Won't<br> you have a chair, please?<br> Miss Em, I'm afraid...<br> I know. Let her come up. But<br> don't leave me alone with her.<br> She'll wanna be alone<br> with you, Miss Em.<br> Well, I don't.<br> How is my dear<br> Cousin Em today?<br> Well, I'll find out.<br> Sit in that chair.<br> If I knock over the bell, tell her I have to<br> have an enema or something. Get rid of her.<br> But Miss Em, I've just<br> started your luncheon.<br> Do what you're told, honey.<br> Oh, Mrs. Wooley,<br> Miss Em can see you now.<br> I know. I can hear.<br> Cousin Em, what do you<br> mean, gettin' sick like this?<br> When you're 80 years old, you<br> expect to be sick. Sit down.<br> Now, now. Naughty, naughty.<br> Eighty years young is what we say.<br> I don't. It's old, and I<br> won't have it minimized.<br> Takes a lot of livin' to get<br> there and pure, cursed endurance.<br> Eighty years young indeed!<br> Yes, yes, Cousin Em.<br> Of course.<br> That's all now. I'll be<br> sitting here with Cousin Em.<br> Stay there, Pinky.<br> She's a trained nurse. I want<br> her there in case I have a spell.<br> Oh. Now, tell me, dear.<br> Are you being taken care of?<br> What can I do for you?<br> Nothing.<br> Jeffers and I have been away on holiday,<br> and we didn't know a thing until yesterday.<br> I said to Jeffers, "I'm gonna see Cousin<br> Em tomorrow no matter how busy I am.<br> "I just have to know whether she's<br> getting every single thing she needs. "<br> And Jeffers said to me, "Melba, that's<br> just like you. You can never rest<br> "till you know<br> you've done your duty.<br> "And if you can take a little sunshine into<br> the life of that poor old soul, you'll... "<br> Cousin Em?<br> She's nappin'.<br> Or is she doped?<br> Just tired.<br> She's been very ill.<br> Well, I'll just sit here<br> till she wakes up.<br> Oh, Pinky, I do believe I forgot to<br> tell George to put the brake on my car.<br> Go down there<br> and make sure it's on.<br> Cousin Em...<br> I never nap,<br> and I'm not doped.<br> My goodness,<br> she's whiter than I am!<br> Prettier too.<br> Well, it just gives me<br> the creeps.<br> Seriously, Cousin Em. I gotta<br> talk to you alone. It's important.<br> I came in to warn you about this girl, Pinky.<br> My new maid, Rozelia, knows all about her.<br> Now, Melba. I'm not gonna soil my<br> ears by listening to kitchen gossip.<br> But for all you know, lyin' up here<br> in bed, she's stealin' you blind.<br> Oh, Melba.<br> I think I left my brooch<br> over there on the bureau.<br> See if it's still there.<br> Well, I certainly will.<br> I most certainly will. That's<br> just what I been talking about.<br> Oh, is this it?<br> Yes.<br> Well, thank goodness.<br> It's still here.<br> Oh.<br> Mrs. Wooley, George says<br> your brake is still on.<br> What do you think of the brooch? Hmm?<br> Oh! Oh, it's lovely, Cousin<br> Em. Priceless. A real antique.<br> Why do you ask?<br> Oh, I know<br> you like jewelry.<br> Just wanted to be sure. I was<br> thinkin' of makin' my will.<br> Oh, Cousin Em, you mustn't<br> think of such a thing.<br> Why, it isn't as if<br> you had a lot of relatives.<br> Jeffers and I are<br> the only two you got.<br> And I know how strongly you feel<br> about keepin' things in the family.<br> What an idea to make a will. Why,<br> you'll live years and years, dear!<br> Pinky's a nurse. She graduated from<br> one of the best hospitals up yonder.<br> Let's ask her. Think I<br> should be makin' my will?<br> Well, if you were ever gonna make a will,<br> Miss Em, it's time you were getting it done.<br> There, Melba. There's a<br> nurse's opinion. Very sensible,<br> especially as it<br> agrees with my own.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley.<br> Miss Em must rest now.<br> Well, she looks fine to me,<br> and besides, we haven't finished<br> our little visit yet, have we?<br> I do feel a little queer. Maybe<br> I have another fit comin' on.<br> Fit?<br> That's the way they start.<br> Then I go clean<br> out of my head.<br> Oh.<br> Well, in that case, I guess<br> I had better be on my way.<br> Oh, you going? But you'll<br> come back, won't you?<br> Oh, yes, dear.<br> I'll be in first thing<br> next week. I certainly will.<br> And no more nonsense about<br> making a will, you naughty girl.<br> No more nonsense!<br> Stop that. I won't have you<br> laughing at my relatives.<br> Sorry, Miss Em. She's not<br> a blood relative, is she?<br> She married my<br> cousin, Jeffers Wooley.<br> He's my first cousin,<br> once removed.<br> He nearly removed himself clean out<br> of the family when he married her.<br> Jeffers never did<br> have much sense.<br> His father wanted him to study<br> law. Didn't have the brains for it.<br> Took up insurance.<br> Tried to sell me a policy.<br> Life insurance,<br> he called it.<br> I asked him if it would insure that I should<br> live one day longer that the Lord allows.<br> He said it didn't, so I said,<br> "Well, call it death insurance.<br> "You oughta be ashamed mentioning<br> it to one of your own family. "<br> Why are you<br> standing there for?<br> Do you want tea or milk<br> with your lunch?<br> Coffee.<br> Miss Em, you know<br> the doctor said...<br> I said coffee,<br> and make it strong.<br> Yes, Miss Em.<br> And, Pinky,<br> when you bring my tray<br> bring me paper, pen and ink.<br> When you've washed the dishes, you<br> can take the rest of the afternoon off.<br> I don't like to leave<br> you alone, Miss Em.<br> Then send Dicey over.<br> She can't stay long.<br> This is her afternoon<br> to take the wash into town.<br> Don't argue.<br> Do as I say. Don't want you<br> back here till after 5:00.<br> Yes, Miss Em.<br> Make that coffee strong.<br> I want the spoon<br> to stand up in it.<br> Yes, Miss Em.<br> Miss Em!<br> Miss Em! Miss Em.<br> Why am I in bed for?<br> Thought I was<br> sittin' in a chair.<br> You've had another attack.<br> You've been up<br> and doing too much.<br> Whose business is it if I do<br> too much, I'd like to know?<br> Nobody's at all if you<br> want to shorten your life.<br> Flat on her back.<br> No. No. Prop me up.<br> Give me some pillows.<br> I'm not gonna lie flat<br> until I'm laid out.<br> Be soon enough now.<br> Might as well let her<br> have her own way.<br> That's all I ever wanted,<br> to have my own way.<br> Here.<br> Open your mouth.<br> What's that? Dope?<br> Open your mouth.<br> I want some fresh water.<br> It's stuck in my throat.<br> No, I said fresh water.<br> Close the door behind you.<br> There's a draft in here.<br> I don't want that girl<br> knowin' my business.<br> Now, go over there and<br> look on the second shelf<br> in that book.<br> No, no. The other end. The other end.<br> There. Now, open the book.<br> There's an envelope in it.<br> Get the envelope.<br> Bring it here.<br> That's my will, and I<br> want you to witness it.<br> Of course. Surely.<br> No. You don't have to read<br> it. I just want you to sign it.<br> Mmm.<br> Here. You'll have to sign it<br> again in my presence.<br> You know my signature.<br> Sign it again, please.<br> These things have<br> to be done legally.<br> Oh, lawyers have more fool<br> rigamarole than doctors.<br> There. Now, put it back in the envelope.<br> Seal it up.<br> Put it away.<br> Who's your executor?<br> You are.<br> Me?<br> Isn't Judge Walker<br> your lawyer?<br> He's retiring.<br> Aren't you my friend?<br> No.<br> Never mind that now.<br> I don't need it.<br> It's gone down.<br> You didn't think I'm<br> plannin' to die this minute?<br> I'll be up to meet my<br> classes right after holidays.<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> My school...<br> What'll the girls be<br> doin' with me in bed?<br> Don't you worry, now. You'll<br> be up and around in a few days.<br> Try to get some sleep now.<br> A fine woman.<br> One of the old school.<br> Never afraid to speak her mind or take<br> a stand for what she thought was right.<br> How long, Doctor?<br> Can't tell.<br> Extraordinary vitality,<br> but the last attack...<br> Perhaps a week.<br> Perhaps only a few hours.<br> Isn't there anything...<br> There, now.<br> You did a good job.<br> I might even say<br> a devoted job.<br> Well, I'll stop in<br> first thing tomorrow.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, Doctor.<br> Twenty cents, please.<br> Somethin' for ya, ma'am?<br> Yes. Do you have any<br> mourning veils, please?<br> Right this way, ma'am.<br> This is our best quality,<br> ma'am, 2.98,<br> and the last<br> we got in stock.<br> Yes. That'll be fine.<br> I'll take it.<br> I'll allow you're goin' to<br> Miss Em's funeral, ma'am.<br> They say she had a lot<br> of friends. Miss Viola.<br> Come wait on me, please. Sorry,<br> Ms. Wooley. Just a minute, please.<br> I'll be right with ya.<br> Where's Mr. Goolby?<br> Excuse me, please, ma'am. I only<br> meant I was waitin' on someone.<br> Mr. Goolby!<br> I only have to wrap this and<br> get the change. Mr. Goolby!<br> Why, yes, Mrs. Wooley, what can<br> I do for you today, please, ma'am?<br> Since when has it been your policy<br> to wait on nigras before white folks?<br> Why, I... I'm sorry,<br> Mrs. Wooley. I'm...<br> I'm sure that Miss Viola<br> just... Just didn't see you.<br> Miss... Miss Viola.<br> Well, I'm...<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley.<br> I should think you would be. I'll repeat...<br> Since when has it been your policy...<br> Now, just what would you be interested in<br> this morning? We have some nice broadcloth.<br> We also have some...<br> What's that?<br> Well, that's the money, the<br> money, ma'am, she gave me, $5.00.<br> Is that Miss Em's money?<br> No, Mrs. Wooley.<br> Would you mind tellin' me<br> where you did get it?<br> I don't care to say<br> where I got it, Mrs. Wooley.<br> Well, that's all you'll get away<br> with. You can rest assured of that.<br> Charge this.<br> What's going on?<br> I'll take my veil now,<br> Mr. Goolby,<br> unless you don't sell<br> to colored people.<br> I'm in business to sell goods, and<br> your money's good if it's honest money.<br> It's honest money.<br> My grandmother earned it<br> by harder work than selling<br> goods over a counter.<br> Do you wish<br> to sell me the veil?<br> Very well, Mr. Goolby.<br> My change, please.<br> When are you fixin'<br> to leave, honey?<br> Oh, uh...<br> In the morning.<br> There's a train at 9:00.<br> Then, in that case, I'm gonna<br> fix ya a nice, hot supper tonight.<br> Oh, Granny, please<br> don't trouble yourself.<br> I don't...<br> Oh.<br> Howdy, Aunt Dicey.<br> Howdy, Doc Joe.<br> Howdy, Pinky.<br> Here. Have a chair, Dr. Joe.<br> Somebody sick<br> out this way?<br> No. Nobody's sick.<br> I got some news for you, and I thought<br> the sooner you knew it, the better.<br> Copy of Miss Em's will.<br> She left her pa's law books<br> to her cousin, Mr. Wooley.<br> Family portraits too.<br> And her jewelry<br> to Mrs. Wooley.<br> Good, 'cause Mrs. Wooley sure likes<br> all kinds of geegaws and fixin's.<br> "To my faithful servant and<br> friend, Dicey Johnson, colored,<br> "I leave all personal clothing<br> of which I died possessed. "<br> Bless her heart. Sometimes I think<br> she always get her shoes extra big<br> 'cause when these fit her just<br> right, they pinch my bunion.<br> And I'm mighty proud<br> to have her clothes too.<br> Miss Em left you the house,<br> Pinky, and everything in it.<br> The land too,<br> about 20 acres.<br> "The remainder of my estate<br> I give and bequeath<br> "to the aforesaid Dicey<br> Johnson's granddaughter, Pinky.<br> "This bequest being an expression<br> of my genuine regard for her<br> "and my confidence in the use to<br> which she will put this property. "<br> That what the paper say?<br> Here.<br> Read it for yourself.<br> It say it for a fact,<br> Doc Joe?<br> That's the way<br> she wrote it.<br> But if I were you, I<br> wouldn't count on it just yet.<br> You see, the Wooleys,<br> Mrs. Wooley in particular,<br> figured on gettin'<br> all that stuff.<br> Hear they've already<br> hired a lawyer.<br> You mean, they're gonna<br> contest it? On what grounds?<br> Undue influence,<br> I suppose,<br> question Miss Em's sanity,<br> that sort of thing.<br> There's already<br> been some talk.<br> So that's why Mrs. Wooley<br> and those men in town...<br> Don't you think<br> Miss Em was sane?<br> Far as I know,<br> she was.<br> That last night her mind<br> wandered a bit<br> but that's not unnatural.<br> You just keep that if you<br> want to look it over some more.<br> But I don't believe<br> I'd count on gettin' it.<br> Better wait and see.<br> I don't know how the folks<br> around here are gonna take this.<br> I wonder why she did it.<br> Ain't you gonna finish<br> your fried chicken, honey?<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.<br> I wonder why she did it.<br> Well, Miss Em had grown<br> powerful fond of you.<br> But she should've<br> known better.<br> Pinky, I've lived<br> in this world a long time,<br> long enough to know for sure if it's<br> somethin' white folks don't want you to have<br> or somethin' they<br> want for their self,<br> you might as well<br> forget all about it.<br> But she meant me<br> to have it.<br> "Expression of my<br> genuine regard for her<br> "and my confidence in the use to<br> which she will put this property. "<br> What did she mean?<br> That don't mean nothin' where<br> the white folks is concerned.<br> 'Sides, you goin' back<br> up yonder, so why...<br> Evenin', Sister Johnson.<br> Evenin', Miss Pinky.<br> Hello, Jake.<br> Well, I just started uptown, and<br> I thought I'd stop by for a while.<br> Well, Miss Pinky, I hear as how<br> you got some property comin' to ya.<br> What else have you heard?<br> Well, the white<br> folks are sayin'<br> you kept Miss Em<br> doped all the time.<br> They say she must have<br> been out of her head,<br> and you must've made<br> her write that will.<br> It's nonsense,<br> and they know it.<br> Is or ain't,<br> I don't know.<br> But it sure spells<br> trouble for somebody.<br> If I was you, Miss Pinky, I'd stick<br> close to the house for a while.<br> She's leavin' first<br> thing in the morning.<br> Goin' back up north?<br> Yes.<br> That's good.<br> That's mighty good.<br> Then Ms. Wooley get<br> the property by default.<br> Everything's fine,<br> no trouble for nobody.<br> Is that the law?<br> Default? Well, unless you get<br> a lawyer to file an answer.<br> Of course, me, I've had considerable<br> dealings with the law, but I ain't licensed.<br> But even if I was licensed,<br> I wouldn't touch your case<br> for a stack of hundred<br> dollar bills that high.<br> I got a nice house<br> and no fire insurance.<br> And I'm glad you decided to<br> be sensible about this thing.<br> Because if you hadn't, I was gonna<br> make reservations across the state line<br> and go fishin'<br> for three or four weeks.<br> Oh, what is it?<br> What is it, child?<br> Pinky.<br> Pinky, tell me.<br> What are you fixin' to do?<br> I'll be staying on for a while,<br> till this business is settled.<br> Miss Em meant me<br> to have the house<br> and I'm not gonna give it<br> up to please Mrs. Wooley<br> or anybody.<br> Granny.<br> Can't do it, Pinky.<br> You know that I'm retiring.<br> As judge, yes, sir. But that<br> leaves you free to take my case.<br> Frankly, I don't want<br> to get mixed up in this.<br> There's too much feelin', too many<br> tales around about you and Miss Em.<br> They're not true, sir.<br> Possibly they're not, but...<br> Say, perhaps you could<br> compromise, settle it out of court.<br> I'm sure Mrs. Wooley would<br> be generous. With my property?<br> Court'll decide<br> whose it is.<br> It won't even come up<br> before the court,<br> unless I can induce<br> a lawyer to act for me.<br> But you don't want a lawyer who thinks<br> the will was ill-considered and a mistake.<br> All right, sir.<br> Good-bye.<br> Judge Walker, Miss Em<br> was your lifelong friend.<br> Whether the will<br> was a mistake or not,<br> wouldn't she expect you<br> to help carry out her wishes?<br> I'll take your case.<br> Thank you, sir. Of course,<br> I'll pay the customary fees.<br> Oh, no. There'll be expenses you'll<br> have to meet, but there won't be any fee.<br> I'm a fool to take your case and<br> the only one who can win it for you<br> but if I'm gonna get into a<br> fight, it'll be on clean ground.<br> Come see me tomorrow.<br> But it was Miss Em who owned the property,<br> and she wanted this girl to have it.<br> But that isn't the point. Doc.<br> It's the principle.<br> Dr. Joe?<br> Come on.<br> See ya later, Doc.<br> Be seein' ya, Doc.<br> Dr. Joe, could you help me,<br> help me to find a job?<br> I only need a few days to<br> help cover the court expenses<br> and I can't ask Granny.<br> She's been ill lately, hasn't<br> been able to work at all.<br> Might as well<br> face it, Pinky.<br> I couldn't possibly<br> get you a job now.<br> A lot of the folks even down<br> on my neck about this thing,<br> blamin' me for puttin' you<br> over there in the first place.<br> If it isn't too much,<br> I could...<br> Oh, no, Doctor.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll find a way.<br> Good-bye.<br> Hello.<br> Pinky?<br> Yes, Granny?<br> Tom.<br> Darling, come here.<br> Granny.<br> Granny, this is<br> Dr. Thomas Adams.<br> How do you do?<br> Pleased to meet you, sir.<br> I reckon you got<br> things to talk about.<br> Why on earth<br> are you doing this?<br> I needed some money.<br> Granny was sick.<br> Could've asked me for it.<br> No, Tom.<br> This is something<br> I have to do by myself.<br> I still don't know<br> what it's all about, Pat,<br> or why you think it's important<br> enough to change our plans.<br> Quite a stir in the papers up<br> north, Negro papers in particular.<br> Got ahold of some<br> clippings for you.<br> I read in one of 'em the<br> trial was set for tomorrow.<br> Read them.<br> "Negro Heiress<br> Defies Lynch Law. "<br> Yes, there... There was a reporter<br> here, but I didn't tell him anything.<br> "Negro Girl Fights<br> To Hold Her... "<br> I had no idea<br> they'd make so much of it.<br> Why go through with it? What for?<br> It isn't too late to back out.<br> The trial's tomorrow.<br> Let it go by default.<br> We don't need the house.<br> I got plenty for both of us.<br> Be sensible. Pack,<br> and let's get out of here.<br> I can't do that, Tom.<br> What are you fighting for, a run-down<br> house and a few acres of worthless land?<br> No.<br> If I should back out now,<br> I'd be letting Miss Em down.<br> I can't do that.<br> I can't let her down.<br> I can't let myself down<br> or my people.<br> They're not your people, Pat!<br> What?<br> Not really. There'll be no Pinky<br> Johnson after we're married.<br> You'll be Mrs. Thomas Adams<br> for the rest of your life.<br> Tom, you can change your name, but I wonder<br> if you can change what you really are inside.<br> What's behind all this?<br> You haven't really told me.<br> I don't know. I'm not<br> being heroic. I'd hate that.<br> I just know I have to go<br> through with it to the end.<br> You see, they're trying<br> to steal the property,<br> steal it from Miss Em<br> as much as from me.<br> They'll probably<br> get away with it.<br> But I'm gonna make them<br> do it out in the open,<br> right out in court for<br> everyone to see and hear.<br> It won't be pleasant, Tom. They'll<br> lie. They'll try to humiliate me.<br> They'll try every<br> trick of prejudice.<br> But I just...<br> All right, Pat. I'll<br> be there. I understand.<br> We also propose to show, Your Honor,<br> that the defendant, Pinky Johnson<br> colored,<br> of a violent nature,<br> quarrelsome,<br> a troublemaker,<br> that she is capable of executing<br> the scheme I have described to you<br> and that she had every<br> opportunity of doing so.<br> The deceased was<br> unquestionably senile.<br> The fact that she signed the will<br> twice is evidence of a confused mind.<br> She was unduly influenced by the<br> defendant as I have outlined to you.<br> And she was under<br> the influence of drugs,<br> administered by<br> the defendant.<br> Furthermore, this will<br> was written at a time when<br> reliable witnesses will<br> prove she was of unsound mind.<br> May I see that will<br> again, please?<br> In view of these things, we therefore<br> ask that the will be set aside<br> and the property inherited<br> by the next of kin.<br> I yield to you,<br> Judge Walker.<br> Your Honor.<br> I agreed to act for the<br> defendant in this case<br> because I feared an injustice<br> was about to be done.<br> Your Honor, apparently my<br> fears were well-founded.<br> Counsel for the plaintiff<br> has made it perfectly clear<br> that my client in effect is to<br> be tried because she is a Negro<br> and because a Negro cannot be permitted<br> to inherit property in this community.<br> That is a harsh fact,<br> but we must face it.<br> Though many of us may<br> criticize this bequest,<br> I do not believe any of us who knew Miss<br> Em, and most of us knew and loved her,<br> can accept the contention<br> that she was insane.<br> I do not believe counsel<br> for the plaintiff can prove<br> that undue influence<br> was exerted by my client.<br> I think most of us know how difficult it<br> was to influence Miss Em in any respect.<br> We need not look too far for a<br> motive in making this bequest.<br> She was a proud woman<br> who'd leave no debt unpaid.<br> This was a real obligation.<br> She took the only means open to her<br> of paying for my client's services,<br> through the provisions<br> of her will.<br> The expressed wishes of the<br> dead should not be set aside<br> to gratify the greed or<br> the prejudice of the living.<br> Your Honor, this is<br> a small country town.<br> We've always thought that what happened<br> here was our own private concern.<br> This is no longer true,<br> just as it is no longer true<br> that our country as a whole<br> can exist entirely to itself.<br> What is done in our courts<br> in cases such as this<br> has become a matter of moment<br> in the eyes of the world.<br> Let us examine our conscience. Let us<br> look into our attitude and our tradition.<br> Let us take care, lest<br> it be said of us that here<br> there is neither<br> law nor justice.<br> Your Honor, we're all anxious to get to<br> the bottom of this as quickly as possible<br> before the temperature of this<br> room reaches the boiling point.<br> Fortunately, there is one witness<br> who is qualified to testify<br> on the only matters of<br> pertinence to this hearing,<br> the question of Miss Em's sanity<br> and the question of undue influence.<br> Incidentally, he will be<br> the defense's only witness.<br> He was Miss Em's physician, in constant<br> attendance during her last illness.<br> He was also her confidant,<br> witnessed her will,<br> and is the executor of her<br> estate, Dr. Joseph McGill.<br> Your Honor, I disagree with<br> my esteemed opponent's notions<br> of what is or isn't<br> pertinent to this hearing.<br> But I am perfectly willing to have Dr.<br> McGill take the stand at this point.<br> Very well.<br> Call Dr. McGill.<br> Do you think that's...<br> Oh, let him put his witness on<br> first. We'll close with ours.<br> Dr. Joe doesn't seem<br> to be here, Your Honor.<br> Well, take a look in the<br> corridor. See if he's there.<br> He ain't out here,<br> Your Honor.<br> Well, that bein' the case we'll have to<br> proceed with the plaintiff's witnesses.<br> Are you ready, Mr. Stanley?<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> Better find Dr. Joe<br> and bring him here.<br> Yes, Judge Walker.<br> Money and a man, I believe,<br> is what caused the trouble.<br> The usual thing.<br> Well, we picked 'em both up, along<br> with the man they was fightin' over.<br> Judge Walker heard the case.<br> That's all I know about it.<br> Yeah, money and a man.<br> Thank you.<br> Your witness.<br> Chief Anderson, what was the final<br> prison sentence imposed on my client?<br> Why, Judge Walker,<br> you know there wasn't any.<br> So she was cleared.<br> Is that correct?<br> Well, I wouldn't<br> exactly say that.<br> You wouldn't?<br> You generally always let 'em off with<br> a good talkin' to, like you give her.<br> You know how it is.<br> If you put them niggers in jail<br> every time somethin' happens...<br> That'll do.<br> Your Honor,<br> this witness's testimony<br> should be ignored and<br> stricken from the record<br> as totally irrelevant<br> to the hearing.<br> Your Honor, I object!<br> Just a minute! The court is capable<br> of deciding any questions of relevancy.<br> Motion denied.<br> Call the next witness.<br> Well, for one thing,<br> on my last visit<br> this girl simply wouldn't<br> leave the room.<br> And I could see that Cousin Em<br> actually didn't dare to dismiss her.<br> Then Cousin Em began<br> to talk about makin' a will.<br> Well, I tried to cheer her up, but she turned<br> to this Pinky and said, "What do you think?"<br> As if... As if she didn't<br> dare to make up her mind alone<br> which was never<br> like Cousin Em, never.<br> What did the girl say?<br> Oh, she spoke up,<br> bold as you please,<br> and said Cousin Em had better make<br> a will if she was ever goin' to.<br> That's the part<br> I mentioned to you.<br> Impudent, yes,<br> but the way she said it,<br> a threat too.<br> And I'm just glad that Cousin Em was<br> allowed to die a natural death in her bed.<br> I think everyone in this courtroom<br> understands what you mean, ma'am.<br> Did you notice anything peculiar<br> about her condition that day?<br> Oh, yes. She closed her<br> eyes while I was talkin'.<br> She kept droppin' off in<br> a stupor. She was doped!<br> And then she told me<br> she was subject to fits,<br> that half the time she was<br> clean out of her mind.<br> Poor soul. Poor soul.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Wooley.<br> Your witness.<br> Mrs. Wooley, you have testified that<br> my client's tone was threatenin'.<br> Now, Miss Em must've made some<br> sort of reply if she was threatened.<br> What were Miss Em's<br> next words?<br> I don't remember.<br> She was doped.<br> Didn't she say Pinky's<br> opinion was sensible<br> because that agreed with<br> what she thought herself?<br> Were you there, Judge Walker, or are you<br> just bein' primed by that girl over there?<br> Did you ever hear such...<br> Uh, answer the<br> question, please.<br> Isn't that what<br> Miss Em said?<br> I'd certainly<br> remember it if she had.<br> Mrs. Wooley, do you know<br> the penalty for perjury?<br> I object!<br> Your Honor, I object to this<br> attempt to intimidate the witness!<br> She's answered the question.<br> She doesn't remember.<br> And now, if my opponent will stop<br> putting words in the mouth of the dead...<br> No personalities,<br> gentlemen.<br> It's hot enough<br> in here as it is.<br> Will Your Honor please<br> rule on my objection?<br> Objection sustained.<br> Thank you!<br> Didn't I tell you<br> he's a good'n?<br> So, Aunt Dicey, you were there in the<br> room when she was writing her will.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Sittin' right there,<br> like I always done<br> when my Pinky's out.<br> And Miss Em was still writin' when<br> I left to take the wash uptown.<br> 'Cause Judge Walker and some is mighty<br> particular when they gets their wash.<br> I understand,<br> Aunt Dicey.<br> You know what<br> a hypodermic is?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Did you ever see your granddaughter<br> stick one of those things in Miss Em?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I see her do it twice.<br> What happened?<br> Miss Em talked<br> to herself for a while.<br> You mean raved?<br> Kind of mumbled, like.<br> Then she go off to sleep<br> like she a little baby.<br> Now, just one more<br> question, Aunt Dicey.<br> What makes you think it was her will<br> that Miss Em was writing that day?<br> I know it was, sir.<br> Well, you see, Aunt Dicey,<br> this is a court of law,<br> and you're sworn to tell<br> the truth before God.<br> Some of us think this will may<br> have been written at some other time<br> while your granddaughter<br> was present.<br> Did Miss Em tell you<br> she was writing her will?<br> No, sir, Mr. Stanley.<br> But you were sitting where you could see<br> the paper she was writing on, weren't you?<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Stanley.<br> Well, now, didn't you see<br> enough of it to know what it was?<br> He's going to trap her. He knows she<br> can't read, and she'll never admit it.<br> From Dr. Joe.<br> Come, now, Aunt Dicey.<br> Let's have an answer.<br> You know, sir, as well<br> as me it ain't manners<br> readin' what ain't meant<br> for you to read.<br> Then how can you swear before<br> God you knew it was her will?<br> Now, Aunt Dicey, you<br> answer me the gospel truth!<br> Couldn't this will have been written at<br> some other time? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?<br> Yes...<br> Couldn't Pinky have helped Miss Em<br> make a will when you weren't around?<br> I reckon she could, sir.<br> Your witness!<br> Your Honor, we'll waive<br> cross-examination of this witness.<br> All right, Aunt Dicey.<br> You can step down now.<br> I have here a note from Dr. Joe in<br> which he says he's going to be delayed.<br> Now, on the basis of this note,<br> I petition for a brief recess.<br> May I see this<br> note, please?<br> Do I have your permission<br> to read this to the court?<br> You certainly have.<br> "Sorry. Mary Picken's<br> baby jumped the gun.<br> "When it gets here,<br> I'll get there.<br> "Joe McGill. "<br> Seriously, Your Honor,<br> I object to this petition<br> or to any legal strategy intended solely<br> to drag out this unfortunate affair<br> which should have never<br> seen the light of day anyway.<br> Judge Walker had as much time<br> as we did to summon witnesses<br> and to make sure<br> they'd be here!<br> As for this note, it's easy<br> to read between the lines.<br> Naturally, Dr. Joe didn't want to<br> hurt his old friend's feelings here<br> with a direct refusal to appear as<br> a witness in this unpleasant case.<br> It's obvious, however, that bountiful<br> nature and the ethics of his profession<br> have come to his aid.<br> Oh, this is going to be<br> a long confinement!<br> He's not asking for a recess, Your<br> Honor. He's asking for a postponement!<br> Petition denied,<br> Judge Walker.<br> Thank you,<br> Judge Shoreham.<br> Any more of that, and<br> I'll have the room cleared.<br> Have you any<br> further witnesses?<br> No more, Your Honor.<br> I agree with counsel<br> for the plaintiff.<br> There's no point in<br> dragging this out any longer.<br> Thank you.<br> The court has heard all the facts<br> and is ready to announce its finding.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I do not intend to defend<br> the wisdom of this bequest<br> nor do I intend to base my findings<br> on the conclusions of the witnesses,<br> nor on the hearsay evidence<br> admitted here today.<br> This will is a<br> legal document.<br> I have examined it, and I see no<br> reason to doubt that it was written<br> by a woman in full<br> possession of her faculties.<br> Moreover, plaintiffs have failed to<br> establish that any undue influence<br> was exerted<br> by the defendant.<br> The will is therefore<br> declared to be good and valid<br> and the executor shall carry<br> out its terms as written.<br> But Judge Shoreham!<br> I want it clearly<br> understood,<br> any attempt to interfere with<br> the defendant or her property<br> will be answerable<br> to this court.<br> Court is now adjourned.<br> Quiet! Quiet, please!<br> Judge Walker, I don't<br> know how to thank you.<br> Well, Pinky, you won. You<br> got the house and the land.<br> And you got justice.<br> But I doubt if any other interests<br> of this community have been served.<br> Come on, darling.<br> Let's go.<br> All right, Tom. All right.<br> Big old houses like this<br> are a drug on the market.<br> We'll find a good real estate<br> man and turn it over to him.<br> We'll auction off the furniture<br> and the silver separately.<br> You know, some of those pieces<br> down there look valuable.<br> We'll sell them all in your<br> name, so you'll be independent,<br> just in case you decide<br> to run away from me again.<br> This is quite a room.<br> Yes.<br> Oh, say, isn't this<br> a beautiful fire screen?<br> Miss Em was proud of that. Martha Washington<br> is supposed to have done the embroidery.<br> Oh, we can't let this<br> get away from us.<br> We'll have it sent<br> out to Denver.<br> Denver?<br> Didn't I tell you? I...<br> I've accepted a position<br> in a clinic there.<br> But all your ties<br> are in Boston,<br> your family.<br> Oh. But the...<br> The publicity.<br> Oh, it's partly that,<br> but I've always thought<br> about moving out west.<br> Besides, too many people in Boston<br> know, or they might find out.<br> Pat, you'll love it in Denver. Some<br> friends of mine are starting this clinic.<br> They want me to<br> go in with them.<br> I can't sell the house, Tom. That<br> isn't why she left it to me, to sell,<br> or why I went through<br> with the trial.<br> She said, with confidence in the<br> use to which I'd put the property.<br> Let's be practical. Her lawyer had<br> it straight when he said she was<br> merely, merely trying<br> to pay off her debt to you.<br> Now, if you'll let me...<br> No, that wasn't her reason.<br> She'd have left it to Granny.<br> She owed her far more.<br> Miss Em accepted<br> service as her due.<br> No, she had some purpose,<br> something she wanted me to do.<br> Come on now, Pat. I know she was<br> a wonderful old woman and all that,<br> and she made a deep impression<br> on you, but she's dead.<br> Your own life is much more important<br> than her purpose, if she had one.<br> It's my life<br> she was thinking of.<br> She told me once to be<br> myself wherever I was.<br> Well, that's pretty good advice,<br> but... But you said yesterday,<br> there'd be no Pinky Johnson<br> after we were married.<br> How can I be myself?<br> It was only<br> a figure of speech.<br> Now, let's get out of this place. You're<br> letting the trial get under your skin.<br> Will you forget it?<br> You mean run<br> away from it, Tom.<br> This time to Denver, running<br> away for the rest of our lives.<br> You're all confused.<br> No. I'm just beginning<br> to understand.<br> She didn't want me to go. She didn't<br> want me to pretend. We talked about it.<br> Pat... That's why she wrote the will.<br> She thought the house<br> would keep me here.<br> But she was wrong.<br> That's why she wrote it.<br> She was wrong,<br> wasn't she?<br> Wasn't she?<br> I can't go with you.<br> I'm sick of lying, Tom. We<br> wouldn't be happy, either of us.<br> What do you expect to do, crawl into a<br> closet and live there the rest of your life?<br> Close the door and lock<br> it, lock everything?<br> Pat, look at me.<br> Look at me!<br> Will you come to your senses? You've<br> got to make a break, get away from it!<br> I don't want to get away<br> from anything.<br> I'm a Negro. I can't forget<br> it, and I can't deny it.<br> I can't pretend to be anything else,<br> and I don't want to be anything else.<br> Don't you see, Tom?<br> No, I don't.<br> You can't live<br> without pride.<br> I'm sorry, Tom.<br> I'll never forget you<br> or what you tried to do.<br> But please go now.<br> Don't say anything.<br> Just go.<br> What did you mean,<br> Miss Em?<br> Tell me.<br> Come here a minute.<br> I'm sure you will.<br> Miss Pinky, you have to do<br> something about Aunt Dicey.<br> What is it this time?<br> She's been at that<br> new sterilizer again.<br> Every time I sterilize the sheets, she<br> puts 'em back. Says they ain't white enough.<br> I'll speak to her about it, but<br> I doubt if it'll do much good.<br> Lunch is laid out.<br> All right.<br> I'll get them in.<br> Good morning, Miss Pinky.<br> Hello, Teejoe.<br> Teejoe is gonna do a little<br> flying. That right, Teejoe?<br> Yes, Dr. Canady.<br> Well, Pinky.<br> Hello, Dr. Joe.<br> Mornin', Doctor.<br> Mornin', Doctor.<br> Uh, thought I'd look in<br> on the Freeman boy.<br> He's in the dining room.<br>
