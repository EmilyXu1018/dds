                        Drink up, me hearties, yo ho<br> We kidnap and ravage<br> and don't give a hoot<br> Drink up, me hearties, yo ho<br> Yo ho, yo ho<br> A pirate's life for me<br> We extort, we pilfer<br> We filch, we sack...<br> Quiet, missy!<br> Cursed pirates sail these waters.<br> You don't want to bring<br> them down on us.<br> Mr. Gibbs, that will do.<br> She was singing about pirates!<br> Bad luck to sing about pirates<br> with us mired in this unnatural fog.<br> - Mark my words.<br> - Consider them marked.<br> - On your way.<br> - Aye, Lieutenant.<br> Bad luck to have a woman on board,<br> too. Even a miniature one.<br> It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.<br> Think again, Miss Swann.<br> Vile creatures, the lot of them.<br> I intend to see to it that any man<br> who sails under a pirate flag<br> gets what he deserves.<br> A short drop and a sudden stop.<br> I appreciate your fervor,<br> but I'm concerned about the effect this<br> subject will have upon my daughter.<br> My apologies, Governor Swann.<br> - Actually, I find it all fascinating.<br> - That's what concerns me.<br> There's a boy in the water!<br> Man overboard!<br> Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!<br> Haul him aboard!<br> He's still breathing.<br> Mary, Mother of God!<br> What happened here?<br> Most likely the powder magazine.<br> Merchant vessels run heavily armed.<br> Lot of good it did them.<br> Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.<br> Pirates!<br> There's no proof of that!<br> It was probably an accident.<br> Rouse the captain. Heave to<br> and take in sail. Launch the boats.<br> Elizabeth, accompany the boy.<br> He'll be in your charge.<br> Take care of him.<br> He'll be in your charge.<br> Take care of him.<br> It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.<br> Will Turner.<br> I'm watching over you, Will.<br> You're a pirate!<br> Has he said anything?<br> His name's William Turner.<br> That's all I found out.<br> Take him below.<br> Elizabeth!<br> Are you all right?<br> Are you decent?<br> Yes.<br> Yes?<br> Still abed at this hour?<br> It's a beautiful day.<br> I have a gift for you.<br> - It's beautiful!<br> - Isn't it?<br> May I inquire as to the occasion?<br> Does a father need an occasion<br> to dote upon his daughter?<br> Go on.<br> Actually... I had hoped you might<br> wear it for the ceremony today.<br> The ceremony?<br> Captain Norrington's<br> promotion ceremony.<br> I knew it!<br> Commodore Norrington,<br> as he's about to become.<br> A fine gentleman, don't you think?<br> He fancies you, you know.<br> Elizabeth? How's it coming?<br> - It's difficult to say.<br> - It's the latest fashion in London.<br> Women in London<br> must've learned not to breathe!<br> My Lord, you have a visitor.<br> Mr. Turner! Good to see you again.<br> Good day, sir. I have your order.<br> The blade is folded steel. That's<br> gold filigree laid into the handle.<br> If I may?<br> Perfectly balanced. The tang<br> is nearly the width of the blade.<br> Perfectly balanced. The tang<br> is nearly the width of the blade.<br> Impressive. Very impressive.<br> Commodore Norrington's<br> going to be very pleased with this.<br> Do pass my compliments<br> onto your master.<br> I shall.<br> A craftsman is always pleased<br> to hear his work is appreciated.<br> Elizabeth!<br> You look absolutely stunning!<br> Will! It's so good to see you!<br> - I had a dream about you last night.<br> - About me?<br> - Elizabeth, is that proper?<br> - About the day we met. Remember?<br> How could I forget, Miss Swann?<br> How many times must I ask you<br> to call me Elizabeth?<br> At least once more, Miss Swann.<br> As always.<br> There. See? At least the boy<br> has a sense of propriety.<br> We really must be going.<br> Good day, Mr. Turner.<br> Come along!<br> Good day...<br> Elizabeth.<br> Hold up there, you!<br> It's a shilling to tie up<br> your boat to the dock.<br> I need to know your name.<br> What do you say to three shillings<br> and we forget the name?<br> Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.<br> Two paces... march!<br> Right about... face!<br> Present... arms!<br> This dock is off limits to civilians.<br> This dock is off limits to civilians.<br> I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.<br> If I see one, I shall inform you.<br> I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.<br> If I see one, I shall inform you.<br> There's some high-toned<br> and fancy to-do at the fort.<br> How could it be that two upstanding<br> gentlemen did not merit an invitation?<br> We have to make sure this dock<br> stays off limits to civilians.<br> It's a fine goal, to be sure,<br> but it seems to me, a ship like that<br> makes this one here<br> a bit superfluous.<br> The Dauntless is the power<br> in these waters,<br> but there's no ship that can match<br> the Interceptor for speed.<br> I've heard of one. It's supposed<br> to be fast, nigh uncatchable.<br> The Black Pearl.<br> There's no real ship<br> that can match the Interceptor.<br> The Black Pearl is a real ship.<br> - No, it's not.<br> - It is. I've seen it!<br> - You've seen it?<br> - Yes.<br> - You haven't seen it!<br> - Yes, I have!<br> You've seen a ship with black sails,<br> that's crewed by the damned<br> and captained by a man so evil<br> that Hell itself spat him back out?<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> But I have seen a ship<br> with black sails.<br> No ship not crewed by the damned<br> and captained by a man so evil,<br> Hell spat him back out,<br> could have black sails, so couldn't be<br> any other ship than The Black Pearl.<br> Is that what you're saying?<br> No.<br> Like I said, there's no real ship<br> that can match the Interceptor...<br> You! Get away from there!<br> You don't have permission to be aboard!<br> I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty<br> boat. Ship!<br> - What's your name?<br> - Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.<br> What's your purpose in Port Royal,<br> 'Mr. Smith'?<br> - And no lies!<br> - All right. I confess.<br> I intend to commandeer a ship,<br> pick up a crew in Tortuga,<br> I intend to commandeer a ship,<br> pick up a crew in Tortuga,<br> rape, pillage and otherwise<br> pilfer my black guts out.<br> - I said no lies!<br> - I think he's telling the truth.<br> If he were telling the truth,<br> he wouldn't have told us.<br> Unless he knew you wouldn't believe<br> the truth even if he told you.<br> May I have a moment?<br> You look lovely, Elizabeth.<br> I apologize if I seem forward,<br> but I must speak my mind.<br> This promotion throws into sharp relief<br> that which I have not yet achieved.<br> A marriage to a fine woman.<br> You have become a fine woman.<br> I can't breathe!<br> Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.<br> Then they made me their chief.<br> Elizabeth?<br> Elizabeth!<br> The rocks!<br> Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!<br> - Will you be saving her?<br> - I can't swim!<br> Pride of the King's Navy, you are!<br> Do not lose these.<br> What was that?<br> I got her!<br> - She's not breathing!<br> - Move!<br> - I never would've thought of that.<br> - You've never been to Singapore.<br> Where did you get that?<br> On your feet.<br> Elizabeth!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - Shoot him!<br> - Father!<br> Commodore, do you intend<br> to kill my rescuer?<br> I believe thanks are in order.<br> Had a brush with the East India<br> Trading Company, pirate?<br> Hang him!<br> Keep your guns on him, men.<br> Gillette, fetch some irons.<br> Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?<br> Captain Jack Sparrow,<br> if you please, sir.<br> I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.<br> I'm in the market, as it were.<br> He said he'd come to commandeer one.<br> I told you he was telling the truth.<br> These are his.<br> No additional shot nor powder.<br> A compass that doesn't point north.<br> I half expected it to be made from wood.<br> You are without doubt<br> the worst pirate I've ever heard of!<br> But you have heard of me.<br> Commodore, I must protest!<br> Carefully, Lieutenant.<br> Pirate or not, this man saved my life!<br> One good deed is not enough to redeem<br> a man for his wickedness!<br> - It seems enough to condemn him.<br> - Indeed.<br> Finally.<br> - Don't shoot!<br> - I knew you'd warm up to me.<br> Commodore Norrington,<br> my effects, please. And my hat.<br> Commodore.<br> - Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?<br> - It's Miss Swann.<br> Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.<br> Come, dear, we don't have all day.<br> If you'll be very kind.<br> Easy on the goods, darling.<br> - You're despicable.<br> - Sticks and stones, love.<br> I saved your life, you saved mine.<br> We're square.<br> Gentlemen, my lady,<br> you will always remember this<br> as the day you almost caught...<br> Captain Jack Sparrow!<br> - Now will you shoot him?<br> - Open fire!<br> On his heels!<br> Take cover, man!<br> Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has<br> a dawn appointment with the gallows.<br> I would hate for him to miss it.<br> Search up the stairs!<br> Look lively, men!<br> Right where I left you.<br> Not where I left you.<br> You're the one they're hunting.<br> The pirate!<br> You seem familiar.<br> Have I threatened you before?<br> I avoid familiarity with pirates.<br> It would be a shame to put a black<br> mark on your record. Excuse me.<br> Do you think this wise, boy?<br> Crossing blades with a pirate?<br> You threatened Miss Swann.<br> Only a little.<br> You know what you're doing.<br> Excellent form. How's your footwork?<br> If I step here...<br> Good.<br> And now I step again.<br> Ta.<br> That is a wonderful trick.<br> Except, once again,<br> you are between me and my way out.<br> And now...<br> you have no weapon.<br> Who makes all these?<br> I do.<br> And I practice with them<br> three hours a day.<br> You need to find yourself a girl, mate.<br> Or, the reason you practice three hours<br> a day is that you already found one<br> and are otherwise incapable<br> of wooing said strumpet.<br> You're not a eunuch, are you?<br> I practice three hours a day<br> so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!<br> - You cheated!<br> - Pirate.<br> - Move away!<br> - No.<br> Please?<br> No! I cannot just step aside<br> and let you escape.<br> This shot is not meant for you.<br> There he is! Over here!<br> Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've<br> assisted in the capture of a fugitive.<br> Just doing my civic duty, sir.<br> I trust you will remember this as the<br> day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.<br> Take him away.<br> - Come here, boy. Come here.<br> - Who wants a juicy bone?<br> Come here, boy!<br> You can keep doing that forever.<br> The dog is never going to move.<br> Excuse us if we haven't resigned<br> ourselves to the gallows just yet.<br> There you go, miss. It was<br> a difficult day for you, I'm sure.<br> I suspected Commodore Norrington would<br> propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.<br> I meant you being threatened<br> by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!<br> Yes, it was terrifying.<br> But... the Commodore proposed!<br> Fancy that.<br> That's a smart match, miss,<br> if it's not too bold to say.<br> It is a smart match.<br> He's a fine man.<br> He's what any woman<br> should dream of marrying.<br> That Will Turner...<br> he's a fine man, too.<br> That is too bold.<br> Beggin' your pardon.<br> It was not my place.<br> Has my daughter<br> given you an answer yet?<br> No, she hasn't.<br> She has had a trying day.<br> - Ghastly weather, don't you think?<br> - Really bleak.<br> What's that?<br> Cannon fire!<br> Return fire!<br> I know those guns.<br> It's the Pearl.<br> The Black Pearl?<br> I've heard stories.<br> She's been preying on ships<br> and settlements for ten years.<br> - Never leaves any survivors.<br> - No survivors?<br> Then where do the stories<br> come from, I wonder?<br> Mama!<br> - Sight the muzzle flash.<br> - Aim for the flashes!<br> I need a full spread, fore and aft.<br> Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.<br> Governor. Barricade yourself<br> in my office.<br> That's an order.<br> Don't!<br> Hello, chum.<br> Up there!<br> Miss Swann,<br> they've come to kidnap you.<br> - What?<br> - You're the governor's daughter!<br> In here!<br> They haven't seen you.<br> First chance you get, run to the fort.<br> Gotcha!<br> No! It's hot. I'm burning!<br> Come on!<br> Come on, me men.<br> We know you're here, poppet.<br> - Poppet!<br> - Come out.<br> We promise we won't hurt you.<br> We will find you, poppet.<br> You've got something of ours<br> and it calls to us.<br> The gold calls to us.<br> The gold.<br> Hello, poppet.<br> Parley.<br> - What?<br> - I invoke the right of parley.<br> The Code of the Brethren states<br> you have to take me to your captain.<br> I know the Code.<br> You can do me no harm<br> until the parley is complete.<br> - To blazes with the Code.<br> - She wants to be taken to the Captain.<br> And she'll go, without a fuss.<br> We must honor the Code.<br> Say goodbye!<br> Goodbye.<br> - Come on.<br> - Elizabeth.<br> Out of my way, scum!<br> My sympathies. You've no manner<br> of luck at all.<br> Come on, doggy! It's just<br> you and me now.<br> It's you and old Jack. Come on.<br> That's a boy! Get your bone!<br> That's a good boy.<br> A bit closer!<br> That's it, doggy!<br> Come on, you filthy,<br> slimy, mangy character!<br> No! I didn't mean it!<br> This ain't the armory!<br> Well, well, well. Look what we have<br> here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!<br> Last time I saw you,<br> you were all alone on a godforsaken<br> island, shrinking into the distance.<br> His fortunes aren't improved much.<br> Worry about your own fortunes,<br> gentlemen.<br> The deepest circle of Hell is reserved<br> for betrayers and mutineers.<br> So there is a curse.<br> - That's interesting.<br> - You know nothing of Hell.<br> That's very interesting.<br> I didn't know we was takin' on captives.<br> She's invoked the right of parley<br> with Captain Barbossa.<br> - I am here to...<br> - You will speak when spoken to.<br> And ye will not lay a hand on those<br> under the protection of parley.<br> Aye, sir.<br> My apologies, miss.<br> Captain Barbossa... I am here to<br> negotiate the cessation of hostilities.<br> There are a lot of long words there.<br> We're naught but humble pirates.<br> - What is it you want?<br> - Leave and never come back.<br> I'm disinclined to acquiesce<br> to your request.<br> Means "no."<br> Very well.<br> I'll drop it.<br> Me holds are burstin' with swag.<br> That bit of shine matters to us?<br> Why?<br> It's what you've been searching for.<br> I recognize the ship.<br> I saw it eight years ago<br> on the crossing from England!<br> Did you now?<br> Fine. I suppose if it is worthless<br> there's no point in me keeping it.<br> No!<br> You have a name, missy?<br> Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid<br> in the Governor's household.<br> Miss Turner!<br> - Turner!<br> - Bootstrap!<br> How does a maid come to own<br> that trinket? Family heirloom?<br> I didn't steal it,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> You hand it over<br> and we'll leave and never return.<br> Our bargain?<br> Still the guns and stow them. Signal<br> the men and make good to clear port.<br> You have to take me to shore.<br> According to the Code...<br> First...<br> Your return to shore was not part of<br> our negotiations so I must do nothing.<br> Secondly, you must be a pirate for the<br> Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.<br> Thirdly, the code is more what<br> you'd call guidelines than actual rules.<br> Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,<br> Miss Turner.<br> They've taken Elizabeth!<br> Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.<br> We have to hunt them down.<br> We must save her.<br> Where do you propose we start?<br> If you have any information<br> concerning my daughter, share it.<br> That Jack Sparrow.<br> He talked about the Black Pearl.<br> Mentioned it is more what he did.<br> Ask him where it is!<br> He could lead us to it.<br> No.<br> The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,<br> ergo they are not his allies.<br> We will establish their<br> most likely course...<br> That's not good enough!<br> Mr. Turner, you are not a military man<br> or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.<br> And this is not the moment<br> for rash actions!<br> Do not think you are the only man here<br> who cares for Elizabeth.<br> Please.<br> - You! Sparrow!<br> - Aye?<br> You are familiar with<br> the Black Pearl?<br> - I've heard of it.<br> - Where does it make berth?<br> Where does it make berth?<br> Have you not heard the stories?<br> Captain Barbossa and his crew of<br> miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.<br> It's an island that cannot be found,<br> except by those who know where it is.<br> The ship's real, therefore its anchorage<br> must be a real place. Where?<br> - Why ask me?<br> - Because you're a pirate.<br> You want to turn pirate yourself.<br> Is that it?<br> Never!<br> - They took Miss Swann.<br> - So it is that you found a girl!<br> I see!<br> If you intend to brave all,<br> hasten to her rescue,<br> and so, win fair lady's heart,<br> you'll have to do it alone, mate.<br> I see no profit in it for me.<br> - I can get you out of here.<br> - The key's run off.<br> I helped build these cells.<br> These are half-pin barrel hinges.<br> With leverage and the proper application<br> of strength, the door will lift free.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Will Turner.<br> That would be short for William,<br> I imagine. Good, strong name.<br> No doubt named for your father.<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.<br> If you spring me from here,<br> I swear, on pain of death,<br> I shall take you to the Black Pearl,<br> and your bonny lass.<br> Do we have an accord?<br> - Agreed.<br> - Agreed! Get me out!<br> - Hurry! Someone will have heard that.<br> - Not without my effects.<br> We're going to steal a ship?<br> - That ship?<br> - Commandeer.<br> We're going to "commandeer" that ship.<br> Nautical term.<br> One question about your business,<br> or there's no use going.<br> This girl, how far are you willing to go<br> to save her?<br> - I'd die for her.<br> - Good. No worries then.<br> This is either madness or brilliance.<br> It's remarkable how often<br> those two traits coincide.<br> Everyone stay calm!<br> We're taking over the ship.<br> Aye! Avast!<br> This ship cannot be crewed by two men.<br> You'll never make it out of the bay.<br> Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.<br> Savvy?<br> - Commodore!<br> - They're taking the Dauntless!<br> Commodore! They've taken the ship!<br> Sparrow and Turner!<br> They're taking the Dauntless!<br> Rash, Turner. Too rash.<br> That is, without doubt, the worst pirate<br> I have ever seen.<br> Here they come.<br> Bring her around!<br> Search every cabin, every hold,<br> down to the bilges.<br> Sailors, back to the Interceptor!<br> Thank you, Commodore,<br> for getting us ready to make way.<br> We'd have had<br> a hard time by ourselves.<br> Set topsails and clear up this mess.<br> With this wind we won't catch them.<br> I don't need to. Get them in range<br> of the long nines.<br> Run out the guns!<br> We are to fire on our own ship, sir?<br> I'd rather see her at the bottom of the<br> ocean than in the hands of a pirate.<br> Commodore!<br> He's disabled the rudder chain.<br> Abandon ship!<br> That's got to be the best pirate<br> I've ever seen.<br> So it would seem.<br> When I was a lad living in England,<br> my mother raised me by herself.<br> After she died, I came here,<br> looking for my father.<br> Is that so?<br> My father, Bill Turner?<br> It was only after you learned my name<br> you agreed to help.<br> Since that's what I wanted,<br> I didn't press the matter.<br> I'm not a simpleton.<br> You knew my father.<br> I knew him. Probably one of the few<br> who knew him as William Turner.<br> Everyone else just called him<br> "Bootstrap".<br> Bootstrap?<br> Good man. Good pirate.<br> I swear, you look just like him.<br> It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.<br> A respectable man who obeyed the law.<br> He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.<br> My father was not a pirate!<br> Put it away, son.<br> It's not worth you getting beat again.<br> You ignored the rules of engagement.<br> In a fair fight, I'd kill you.<br> That's not much incentive<br> for me to fight fair, is it?<br> As long as you're just<br> hanging there, pay attention.<br> The only rules that matter are these:<br> What a man can do<br> and what a man can't do.<br> You can accept your father was a<br> pirate and a good man, or you can't.<br> Pirate is in your blood, so you'll<br> have to square with that someday.<br> Me, for example,<br> I can let you drown,<br> but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga<br> all by me onesies, savvy?<br> So.<br> Can you sail under the command<br> of a pirate?<br> Or can you not?<br> Tortuga?<br> Tortuga.<br> It is a sad life<br> that has never breathed deep<br> the sweet, proliferous bouquet<br> that is Tortuga. Savvy?<br> What do you think?<br> - It'll linger.<br> - I'll tell you, mate,<br> if every town were like this one,<br> no man would ever feel unwanted.<br> Scarlett!<br> Not sure I deserved that.<br> Not sure I deserved that.<br> Giselle.<br> Giselle.<br> - Who was she?<br> - What?<br> I may have deserved that.<br> Curse you for breathing,<br> you slack-jawed idiot!<br> Mother's love!<br> Jack!<br> You should know not to wake a man<br> when he's sleepin'.<br> - It's bad luck.<br> - Fortunately, I know how to counter it.<br> The man who did the waking<br> buys the man who was sleeping a drink.<br> The man who was sleeping drinks it<br> while listening to his proposition.<br> Aye, that'll about do it.<br> Blast! I'm already awake!<br> That was for the smell.<br> Keep a sharp eye.<br> Now, what's the nature<br> of this venture of your'n?<br> Now, what's the nature<br> of this venture of your'n?<br> I'm going after the Black Pearl.<br> I know where it's going to be,<br> and I'm gonna take it.<br> Jack, it's a fool's errand.<br> You know better than me<br> the tales of the Black Pearl.<br> That's why I know<br> what Barbossa is up to.<br> All I need is a crew.<br> Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer<br> fools nor strike a bargain with one.<br> It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.<br> Prove me wrong. What makes you think<br> Barbossa will give up his ship to you?<br> Let's just say it's a matter<br> of leverage.<br> The kid?<br> That is the child<br> of Bootstrap Bill Turner.<br> His only child. Savvy?<br> Is he now?<br> Leverage, says you.<br> I feel a change in the wind, says I.<br> I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be<br> some sailors on this rock crazy as you.<br> One can only hope.<br> - Take what you can!<br> - Give nothin' back!<br> - Take what you can!<br> - Give nothin' back!<br> You'll be dining with the captain,<br> and he requests you wear this.<br> Tell him that I am disinclined<br> to acquiesce to his request.<br> He said you'd say that.<br> He also said if that be the case,<br> you'll be dining with the crew.<br> And you'll be naked.<br> Fine.<br> There's no need to stand on ceremony,<br> no call to impress anyone.<br> You must be hungry.<br> Try the wine.<br> And the apples. One of those next.<br> It's poisoned.<br> There would be no sense<br> to be killing you.<br> Then release me. You have your trinket.<br> I'm of no further value to you.<br> You don't know what this is, do you?<br> It's a pirate medallion.<br> This is Aztec gold.<br> One of 882 identical pieces they<br> delivered in a stone chest to Corts.<br> Blood money paid to stem the slaughter<br> he wreaked upon them with his armies.<br> Blood money paid to stem the slaughter<br> he wreaked upon them with his armies.<br> But the greed of Corts was insatiable.<br> So the heathen gods<br> placed upon the gold...<br> a terrible curse.<br> Any mortal that removes but<br> a single piece from that stone chest...<br> shall be punished for eternity.<br> Shall be punished for eternity.<br> I hardly believe in ghost stories<br> any more, Captain Barbossa.<br> Aye.<br> That's exactly what I thought<br> when we were first told the tale.<br> Buried on an island of the dead<br> what cannot be found,<br> except for those who know where it is.<br> Find it, we did.<br> There be the chest.<br> Inside be the gold.<br> And we took 'em all!<br> We spent 'em and traded 'em,<br> and frittered 'em away on drink and food<br> and pleasurable company.<br> The more we gave 'em away,<br> the more we came to realize...<br> the drink would not satisfy.<br> Food turned to ash in our mouths,<br> Food turned to ash in our mouths,<br> and all the pleasurable company<br> in the world could not slake our lust.<br> We are cursed men, Miss Turner.<br> Compelled by greed we were, but now...<br> we are consumed by it.<br> There is one way we can end our curse.<br> All the scattered pieces<br> of the Aztec gold must be restored,<br> and the blood repaid.<br> Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.<br> And the blood to be repaid?<br> That's why there's no sense<br> to be killing you.<br> Yet.<br> Apple?<br> I'm curious. After killing me,<br> what are you planning on doing next?<br> Look!<br> The moonlight shows us<br> for what we really are.<br> We are not among the living<br> and so we cannot die.<br> We are not among the living<br> and so we cannot die.<br> But neither are we dead.<br> For too long I've been parched of thirst<br> and unable to quench it.<br> Too long I've been starvin' to death<br> and haven't died.<br> Too long I've been starvin' to death<br> and haven't died.<br> I feel nothing.<br> Not the wind on my face,<br> nor the spray of the sea...<br> nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.<br> You best start believing<br> in ghost stories, Miss Turner.<br> You're in one!<br> What are you looking at?<br> Back to work!<br> You heard the captain.<br> Back to work.<br> Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,<br> faithful hands before the mast.<br> Every man worth his salt,<br> and crazy to boot.<br> So this is your able-bodied crew?<br> - You, sailor!<br> - Cotton, sir.<br> Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage<br> and fortitude to follow orders<br> and stay true in the face of danger<br> and almost certain death?<br> - Mr. Cotton. Answer, man!<br> - He's a mute, sir.<br> Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so<br> he trained the parrot to talk for him.<br> No one's yet figured how.<br> Mr. Cotton's parrot,<br> same question.<br> Wind in your sails!<br> Wind in your sails!<br> Mostly, we figure that means "yes".<br> Of course it does. Satisfied?<br> Well, you've proved they're mad.<br> What's the benefit for us?<br> Anamaria!<br> - I suppose you didn't deserve that.<br> - No, that one I deserved.<br> - You stole my boat!<br> - Actually...<br> Borrowed without permission, but with<br> every intention of bringing it back.<br> - But you didn't!<br> - You'll get another one.<br> - I will.<br> - A better one.<br> A better one!<br> - That one.<br> - What one?<br> That one?<br> Aye. That one.<br> - What say you?<br> - Aye!<br> Aye!<br> Anchor's aweigh!<br> No, it's frightful bad luck<br> to bring a woman aboard, sir.<br> It'll be far worse not to have her.<br> How can we sail to an island<br> that nobody can find,<br> with a compass that doesn't work?<br> The compass doesn't point north, but<br> we're not trying to find north, are we?<br> We should drop canvas, sir.<br> She can hold a bit longer.<br> What's in your head as puts you<br> in such a fine mood, Cap'n?<br> We're catching up.<br> Time to go, poppet.<br> Dead men tell no tales.<br> Chills the bones, how many honest<br> sailors been claimed by this passage.<br> How is it that Jack<br> came by that compass?<br> Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow<br> before he came to Tortuga<br> with a mind to find the treasure<br> of the Isla de Muerta.<br> That was before I'd met him, when he<br> was captain of the Black Pearl.<br> What?<br> - He failed to mention that.<br> - He plays things close to the vest now.<br> And a hard-learned lesson it was.<br> Three days into the trip, the first mate<br> says, "Everything's an equal share."<br> "The location of the treasure, too."<br> So Jack gives up the bearings.<br> That night, there was a mutiny.<br> They marooned Jack on an island<br> and left him to die.<br> But not before he'd<br> gone mad with the heat.<br> So that's the reason for all the...<br> Reason's got nothing to do with it.<br> When a pirate's marooned, he's given<br> a pistol with a single shot. One shot.<br> That won't do much good hunting,<br> nor to be rescued.<br> But after three weeks<br> of a starving belly and thirst,<br> that pistol looks real friendly.<br> But Jack escaped the island,<br> and still has that single shot.<br> He won't use it, though,<br> save on one man.<br> His mutinous first mate.<br> - Barbossa.<br> - Aye.<br> - How did Jack get off the island?<br> - I'll tell ye.<br> He waded out into the shallows,<br> and waited three days and three nights,<br> till all manner of sea creatures<br> became acclimated to his presence.<br> On the fourth morning,<br> he roped a couple of sea turtles,<br> lashed them together<br> and made a raft.<br> - He roped a couple of sea turtles.<br> - Aye.<br> What did he use for rope?<br> Human hair.<br> From my back.<br> - Let go the anchor!<br> - Lower the anchor line!<br> Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.<br> Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.<br> Captain.<br> What if the worst should happen?<br> - Keep to the Code.<br> - Aye. The Code.<br> - Ten years of hoarding swag.<br> - Now we finally get to spend it.<br> Once we're quit of the curse,<br> we'll be rich men...<br> and you can buy an eye<br> that fits and is made of glass.<br> This one does splinter<br> something terrible.<br> Stop rubbing it.<br> What code is Gibbs to keep to<br> if the worst should happen?<br> Pirates' Code.<br> Any man who falls behind<br> is left behind.<br> No heroes amongst thieves.<br> For having such a bleak outlook<br> on pirates<br> you're well on your way<br> to becoming one.<br> Sprung a man from jail,<br> commandeered a ship of the fleet,<br> sailed with a buccaneer crew<br> out of Tortuga...<br> and you're completely obsessed<br> with treasure.<br> That's not true. I am not obsessed<br> with treasure.<br> Not all treasure is silver<br> and gold, mate.<br> Gentlemen, the time has come!<br> Salvation is nigh!<br> - Our torment is nearing an end!<br> - Elizabeth.<br> For ten years<br> we've been tested and tried<br> and each man here has proved his mettle<br> a hundred times over<br> and a hundred times again!<br> Suffered, I have!<br> Punished we were, the lot of us,<br> disproportionate to our crime!<br> Here it is!<br> The cursed treasure of Corts himself.<br> Every last piece that went astray,<br> we have returned.<br> Save for this!<br> - Jack!<br> - Not yet.<br> We wait for the opportune moment.<br> When's that? When it's of greatest<br> profit to you?<br> May I ask you something?<br> Have I ever given you reason<br> not to trust me?<br> Do us a favor. I know it's difficult<br> for you, but please stay here.<br> And try not to do anything stupid.<br> Who among us has paid the blood<br> sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?<br> - Us!<br> - And whose blood must yet be paid?<br> Hers!<br> You know the first thing I'm going to do<br> after the curse is lifted?<br> Eat a whole bushel of apples!<br> Begun by blood.<br> By blood undone.<br> Sorry, Jack.<br> I'm not going to be your leverage.<br> That's it?<br> Waste not.<br> Did it work?<br> - I don't feel no different.<br> - How do we tell?<br> You're not dead!<br> No.<br> - He shot me.<br> - It didn't work.<br> The curse is still upon us!<br> You! Maid! Your father,<br> what was his name?<br> Was your father William Turner?<br> No.<br> Where's his child who sailed<br> from England eight years ago?<br> The child in whose veins flows<br> the blood of William Turner? Where?<br> You two!<br> You brought us the wrong person!<br> No!<br> She had the medallion.<br> She's the proper age.<br> She said her name was Turner.<br> You heard her.<br> I think she lied to us.<br> You brought us here for nothing.<br> I won't take questioning,<br> not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.<br> Who's to blame him? Your decisions<br> have led us from bad to worse!<br> It was you who sent Bootstrap<br> to the depths!<br> And it's you who brought us here<br> in the first place!<br> If any coward here dare challenge me,<br> let him speak!<br> I say we cut her throat<br> and spill all her blood. Just in case.<br> Yeah!<br> The medallion! She's taken it!<br> Get after her, you feckless pack<br> of ingrates!<br> - Where are the oars?<br> - There's no oars!<br> The oars have gone missing!<br> Find them!<br> You!<br> - You're supposed to be dead.<br> - Am I not?<br> Pearlie...<br> Palu-li-la-la-lulu...<br> Parlili...<br> Parsnip... Parsley...<br> Partner...<br> - Parley?<br> - That's the one! Parley!<br> Parley!<br> Parley?<br> Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead<br> thought of parley!<br> That would be the French.<br> - Not more pirates.<br> - Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.<br> Mr. Gibbs?<br> Hey, boy, where be Jack?<br> Jack Sparrow?<br> He fell behind.<br> Keep to the Code.<br> Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!<br> Split-quick, you dibbies!<br> How the blazes did you get<br> off that island?<br> When you marooned me<br> on that godforsaken spit of land,<br> you forgot one very important thing.<br> I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.<br> Well, I won't be making<br> that mistake again.<br> Gents, you all remember<br> Captain Jack Sparrow?<br> Aye.<br> Kill him.<br> The girl's blood didn't work, did it?<br> Hold your fire!<br> You know whose blood we need.<br> I know whose blood you need.<br> What sort of a man<br> trades a man's life for a ship?<br> A pirate.<br> Here. Let me.<br> Thank you.<br> You said you gave Barbossa<br> my name as yours.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.<br> - They're rough.<br> - No. I mean, yes, they are, but...<br> Don't stop.<br> Elizabeth.<br> It's yours.<br> I thought I'd lost it<br> the day they rescued me.<br> It was a gift from my father.<br> He sent it to me.<br> Why did you take it?<br> Because I was afraid<br> that you were a pirate.<br> That would've been awful.<br> It wasn't your blood they needed.<br> It was my father's blood.<br> My blood.<br> - The blood of a pirate.<br> - Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.<br> So you expect to leave me on some beach<br> with nothing but a name<br> and your word it's the one I need,<br> and watch you<br> sail away in my ship.<br> No.<br> I expect to leave you standing on some<br> beach with absolutely no name at all,<br> watching me sail away on my ship, and<br> then I'll shout the name back to you.<br> Savvy?<br> But that still leaves me<br> standing on some beach,<br> with naught but a name and<br> your word it's the one I need.<br> Of the two of us, I am the only one<br> who hasn't committed mutiny.<br> Therefore, my word<br> is the one we'll be trusting.<br> Although, I suppose I should be<br> thanking you because, in fact,<br> if you hadn't betrayed me<br> and left me to die,<br> I would have an equal share<br> in that curse, same as you.<br> Funny old world, isn't it?<br> Captain! We're coming up<br> on the Interceptor.<br> I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.<br> What say we run up a flag of truce,<br> I scurry over to the Interceptor,<br> and I negotiate the return<br> of your medallion?<br> Now that's exactly the attitude<br> that lost you the Pearl.<br> People are easier to search<br> when they're dead.<br> Lock him in the brig.<br> Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!<br> With this wind,<br> she'll carry every sail we've got.<br> - What's happening?<br> - The Black Pearl is gaining on us!<br> This is the fastest ship<br> in the Caribbean.<br> Tell them that after they've caught us.<br> - We're shallower on the draft, right?<br> - Aye.<br> Then can't we lose them<br> on those shoals?<br> We don't have to outrun 'em long.<br> Just long enough.<br> Lighten the ship!<br> Stem to stern!<br> Anything we can afford to lose,<br> see that it's lost!<br> Apparently, there's a leak.<br> Haul on the main brace!<br> Make ready the guns!<br> And run out the sweeps.<br> We're gonna need that.<br> It was a good plan, up till now.<br> Gibbs!<br> We have to make a stand.<br> We must fight!<br> - Load the guns!<br> - With what?<br> Anything! Everything!<br> Anything we have left.<br> Load the guns!<br> Case shot and langrage!<br> Nails and crushed glass!<br> With a will!<br> The Pearl will luff up<br> on our port quarter.<br> She'll rake us<br> without presenting a target.<br> Lower the anchor on the right side.<br> On the starboard side!<br> - It has the element of surprise.<br> - You're daft, lady. You both are.<br> Daft like Jack.<br> Lower the starboard anchor!<br> Do it, you gobs, or it's you<br> we'll load into the cannons!<br> Let go!<br> They're club hauling.<br> Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!<br> Hard a port!<br> Keep her steady, man.<br> - Now!<br> - Fire!<br> Fire all!<br> Stop blowing holes in my ship!<br> - We need more ideas, lass!<br> - It's your turn!<br> - We need us a devil's dowry!<br> - We'll give them her!<br> She's not what they're after.<br> The medallion.<br> Strike your colors,<br> you bloomin' cockroaches!<br> Hands, grapnels at the ready!<br> Prepare to board!<br> Pistols and cutlasses, men!<br> Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!<br> And the rest of you,<br> bring me the medallion!<br> Below!<br> Thanks very much.<br> Jack!<br> Bloody empty!<br> That's not very nice.<br> - Where is the medallion?<br> - Wretch!<br> Where is dear William?<br> Will.<br> Elizabeth!<br> Monkey!<br> I can't move it!<br> Elizabeth!<br> - Thank you, Jack.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Not you. We named the monkey Jack.<br> Gents! Our hope is restored!<br> Any of you so much<br> as thinks the word "parley",<br> I'll have your guts for garters!<br> Will.<br> You godless pirate!<br> Welcome back, miss.<br> You took advantage of our hospitality<br> last time.<br> It holds fair now you return the favor.<br> Barbossa!<br> Will.<br> She goes free!<br> What's in your head, boy?<br> She goes free.<br> You've only got one shot,<br> and we can't die.<br> Don't do anything stupid.<br> You can't. I can.<br> Like that.<br> - Who are you?<br> - No one. He's no one.<br> A distant cousin of my aunt's<br> nephew, twice removed.<br> Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.<br> My name is Will Turner!<br> My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.<br> His blood runs in my veins.<br> It's the spitting image of old<br> Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.<br> On my word, do as I say,<br> or I'll pull this trigger,<br> and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!<br> Name your terms, Mr. Turner.<br> - Elizabeth goes free!<br> - Yes, we know that one.<br> Anything else?<br> And the crew. The crew<br> are not to be harmed.<br> Agreed.<br> Barbossa, you lying bastard.<br> You swore she'd go free.<br> Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.<br> I agreed she'd go free.<br> It was you who failed to specify<br> when or where.<br> Though it does seem a shame to lose<br> something so fine, don't it, lads?<br> So I'll be havin' that dress back<br> before you go.<br> I always liked you.<br> Goes with your black heart.<br> It's still warm.<br> Off you go.<br> Come on.<br> Too long.<br> I'd really rather hoped<br> we were past all this.<br> Jack. Jack!<br> Did you not notice?<br> That be the same island that we made<br> you governor of on our last little trip.<br> I did notice.<br> Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up<br> another miraculous escape.<br> But I doubt it.<br> Off you go.<br> Last time you left me a pistol<br> with one shot.<br> By the powers, you're right.<br> Where be Jack's pistol?<br> Bring it forward.<br> Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman<br> would give us a pair of pistols.<br> It'll be one pistol as before, and you<br> can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,<br> and starve to death yourself.<br> That's the second time<br> I've watched that man take my ship.<br> You were marooned on this island before.<br> We can escape in the same way.<br> To what point and purpose, young missy?<br> The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have<br> a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...<br> Unlikely.<br> ...young Mr. Turner will be dead<br> long before you can reach him.<br> But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.<br> You vanished from under the eyes of<br> seven agents of the East India Company.<br> You sacked Nassau port<br> without even firing a shot.<br> Are you the pirate<br> I've read about or not?<br> How did you escape last time?<br> Last time I was here<br> a grand total of three days.<br> Last time...<br> the rum runners<br> used this island as a cache.<br> They came by and I was able<br> to barter passage off.<br> From the looks of things,<br> they've long been out of business.<br> You probably have your bloody friend<br> Norrington to thank for that.<br> So that's it, then?<br> That's the secret, grand adventure<br> of the infamous Jack Sparrow.<br> You spent three days<br> lying on a beach drinking rum.<br> Welcome to the Caribbean, love.<br> We're devils, we're black sheep<br> We're really bad eggs<br> Drink up, me hearties, yo ho<br> Yo ho, yo ho<br> A pirate's life for me<br> I love this song!<br> Really bad eggs!<br> When I get the Pearl back,<br> I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,<br> and we'll sing it all the time.<br> You will be the most fearsome pirates<br> in the Spanish Main.<br> Not just the Spanish Main, love.<br> The entire ocean.<br> The entire world!<br> Wherever we want to go, we go.<br> That's what a ship is.<br> It's not just a keel and a hull<br> and a deck and sails.<br> That's what a ship needs.<br> But what a ship is...<br> What the Black Pearl really is...<br> is freedom.<br> Jack...<br> It must be really terrible for you<br> to be trapped on this island.<br> Oh, yes.<br> But the company is infinitely better<br> than last time.<br> And the scenery has definitely improved.<br> Mr. Sparrow!<br> I'm not entirely sure I've had enough<br> rum to allow that kind of talk.<br> I know exactly what you mean, love.<br> To freedom!<br> To the Black Pearl!<br> No!<br> Not good! Stop!<br> Not good! What are you doing?<br> You've burned all the food,<br> the shade, the rum.<br> - Yes, the rum is gone.<br> - Why is the rum gone?<br> One, because it is a vile drink that<br> turns respectable men into scoundrels.<br> Two, that signal<br> is over 1,000 feet high.<br> The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.<br> Do you think there is the slightest<br> chance they won't see it?<br> But why is the rum gone?<br> Just wait, Captain Sparrow.<br> You give it one hour, maybe two,<br> keep a weather eye open, and you<br> will see white sails on that horizon.<br> "Must've been terrible for you<br> to be trapped here, Jack."<br> Well, it bloody is now!<br> There'll be no living with her<br> after this.<br> - But we've got to save Will.<br> - No.<br> You're safe now. We will return<br> to Port Royal immediately,<br> not go gallivanting after pirates.<br> Then we condemn him to death.<br> The boy's fate is regrettable, but<br> so is his decision to engage in piracy.<br> To rescue me. To prevent anything<br> from happening to me.<br> If I may be so bold as to interject<br> my professional opinion.<br> The Pearl was listing to scuppers after<br> the battle. She won't make good time.<br> Think about it. The Black Pearl.<br> The last real pirate threat<br> in the Caribbean, mate.<br> How can you pass that up?<br> By remembering that I serve others,<br> Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.<br> Commodore, I beg you,<br> please do this for me.<br> As a wedding gift.<br> Elizabeth?<br> Are you accepting<br> the Commodore's proposal?<br> I am.<br> A wedding. I love weddings.<br> Drinks all around!<br> I know. "Clap him in irons," right?<br> Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany<br> these fine men to the helm<br> and provide us with a bearing<br> to Isla de Muerta.<br> Then contemplate all possible meanings<br> of the phrase "silent as the grave".<br> - Do I make myself clear?<br> - Inescapably clear.<br> Shiver me timbers.<br> Cotton here says you missed a bit.<br> You knew William Turner.<br> Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.<br> Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we<br> did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.<br> Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we<br> did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.<br> He said it wasn't right with the Code.<br> That's why he sent off<br> a piece of the treasure to you.<br> He said we deserved to be cursed,<br> and remain cursed.<br> - Stupid blighter.<br> - Good man.<br> But, as you can imagine, that didn't<br> sit too well with the Captain.<br> That didn't sit too well<br> with the Captain at all.<br> - Tell him what Barbossa did.<br> - I'm telling the story!<br> So what the captain did, he strapped<br> a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.<br> Bootstrap's bootstraps!<br> Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was<br> sinking into the crushin' black oblivion<br> of Davy Jones' locker!<br> It was only after that we learned<br> we needed his blood to lift the curse.<br> That's what you call ironic.<br> Bring him.<br> I don't care for the situation.<br> Any attempt to storm the caves<br> could turn into an ambush.<br> Not if you're the one<br> doing the ambushing.<br> I go in and get Barbossa to send<br> his men out in their little boats.<br> Your mates return to the Dauntless<br> and blast them with your cannons.<br> What do you have to lose?<br> Nothing I'd lament being rid of.<br> Now, to be honest, there's a risk<br> to those aboard the Dauntless,<br> which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.<br> - It's for your own safety.<br> - I don't care, I have to tell him!<br> The pirates are cursed!<br> They can't be killed!<br> He's already informed of that. A mermaid<br> flopped up on deck and told the story.<br> This is Jack Sparrow's doing!<br> No reason to fret. A prick of the<br> finger, a few drops of blood...<br> No mistakes this time. He's only<br> half-Turner. We spill it all!<br> Guess there is reason to fret.<br> - Beg your pardon.<br> - Begun by blood. By blood...<br> Jack!<br> - It's not possible.<br> - Not probable.<br> Where's Elizabeth?<br> Safe, like I promised. She's set to<br> marry Norrington, like she promised,<br> and you get to die for her<br> like you promised.<br> So we're all men of our word, except<br> for Elizabeth, who is a woman.<br> Shut up! You're next!<br> - You don't want to be doing that.<br> - No, I think I do.<br> Your funeral.<br> - Why don't I want to be doing it?<br> - Because...<br> The HMS Dauntless,<br> pride of the Royal Navy,<br> is floating just offshore<br> waiting for you.<br> What are we doing here?<br> The pirates come out,<br> unprepared and unawares.<br> We catch 'em in a crossfire<br> and send 'em down to see Old Hob.<br> I meant, why aren't we doing<br> what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?<br> - With the cannons and all?<br> - Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.<br> You think he wasn't telling the truth?<br> Hear me out, mate.<br> Order your men to row out to the<br> Dauntless, they do what they do best,<br> Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your<br> aunt... There you are with two ships.<br> The makings of your own fleet.<br> You'll take the grandest as your<br> flagship and who's to argue?<br> But what of the Pearl?<br> Name me captain, I'll sail under your<br> colors and give you 10% of me plunder<br> and you get to introduce yourself<br> as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?<br> And in exchange you want me<br> not to kill the whelp.<br> Not at all. By all means,<br> kill the whelp. Just not yet.<br> Wait to lift the curse<br> until the opportune moment.<br> For instance...<br> after you've killed Norrington's men.<br> Every...<br> last...<br> one.<br> You've planned this ever since<br> you learned my name.<br> Yeah.<br> I want 50% of your plunder.<br> - 15.<br> - 40.<br> I'll buy you the hat.<br> A really big one.<br> Commodore.<br> We have an accord.<br> All hands to the boats!<br> Apologies. You give the orders.<br> Gents... take a walk!<br> Not to the boats?<br> Hold fire.<br> This is like what the Greeks<br> done at Troy.<br> Except they was in a horse,<br> instead of dresses. Wooden horse.<br> A moment, please.<br> Elizabeth?<br> I want you to know I believe you made<br> a very good decision today.<br> Couldn't be more proud of you.<br> But a good decision, if made for the<br> wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Elizabeth?<br> Are you there?<br> Are you even listening to me?<br> What have you done?<br> Stop that! I already feel like a fool.<br> You look nice, though.<br> I look nice?<br> I must admit, Jack, I thought<br> I had you figured<br> but it turns out you're<br> a hard man to predict.<br> I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man<br> you can trust to be dishonest.<br> Honestly, it's the honest ones<br> you want to watch out for.<br> You can never predict when they're going<br> to do something incredibly... stupid.<br> You're off the edge of the map, mate.<br> Here there be monsters!<br> Right.<br> What would you eat first?<br> We should decide now so we're ready<br> when the time comes.<br> What was that?<br> Miss Elizabeth!<br> Make for the ship! Move!<br> To the ship!<br> Row, men!<br> You can't beat me, Jack.<br> That's interesting.<br> I couldn't resist, mate.<br> Sorry!<br> What now, Jack Sparrow?<br> Are we to be two immortals, locked<br> in an epic battle until Judgment Day?<br> Or you could surrender.<br> All of you with me. Will is in that cave<br> and we must save him.<br> Ready, and... heave!<br> I need your help. Come on!<br> Any port in a storm.<br> Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.<br> - Are you gonna leave Jack?<br> - Jack owes us a ship.<br> - There's the Code to consider.<br> - The Code?<br> You're pirates. Hang the Code<br> and hang the rules!<br> They're more like guidelines.<br> Bloody pirates!<br> Is it supposed to be doing that?<br> They're stealing our ship.<br> Bloody pirates!<br> Boarders away.<br> Come on!<br> Me eye!<br> I'll teach you the meaning of pain.<br> You like pain?<br> Try wearing a corset.<br> Whose side is Jack on?<br> At the moment?<br> No fair!<br> Ten years you carry that pistol<br> and now you waste your shot.<br> He didn't waste it.<br> I feel...<br> cold.<br> Parley?<br> - The ship is ours, gentlemen.<br> - Huzzah!<br> Huzzah! Huzzah!<br> We should return to the Dauntless.<br> Your fianc will want to know<br> you're safe.<br> If you were waiting<br> for the opportune moment...<br> that was it.<br> Now, I'd be much obliged<br> if you'd drop me off at my ship.<br> I'm sorry, Jack.<br> They done what's right by them.<br> Can't expect more than that.<br> Jack Sparrow...<br> Captain Jack Sparrow.<br> ...for your crimes against the Crown.<br> Said crimes being numerous in quantity<br> and sinister in nature.<br> The most egregious of these<br> to be cited herewith:<br> Piracy, smuggling...<br> This is wrong.<br> Commodore Norrington is bound<br> by the law, as are we all.<br> ...impersonating an officer<br> of the Spanish Royal Navy,<br> impersonating a cleric<br> of the Church of England,<br> sailing under false colors,<br> arson, kidnapping, looting,<br> poaching, brigandage, pilfering,<br> depravity, depredation<br> and general lawlessness.<br> For these crimes, you are sentenced<br> to be hung by the neck until dead.<br> May God have mercy on your soul.<br> Governor Swann.<br> Commodore.<br> Elizabeth.<br> I should have told you every day<br> from the moment I met you...<br> I love you.<br> Watch yourself!<br> Marines!<br> I can't breathe.<br> Elizabeth!<br> Move!<br> I thought we might have to endure<br> some ill-conceived escape attempt,<br> but not from you.<br> On our return to Port Royal,<br> I granted you clemency.<br> And this is how you thank me?<br> By throwing in your lot with him?<br> - He's a pirate.<br> - And a good man.<br> If this means the hangman will earn two<br> pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.<br> My conscience will be clear.<br> You forget your place, Turner.<br> It's right here, between you and Jack.<br> - As is mine.<br> - Elizabeth.<br> Lower your weapons.<br> Put them down!<br> So this is where your heart truly lies?<br> It is.<br> I'm feeling good about this.<br> We've all arrived at a special place.<br> Spiritually, ecumenically,<br> grammatically.<br> I want you to know<br> that I was rooting for you, mate.<br> Know that.<br> Elizabeth.<br> It would never have worked<br> between us, darling.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Will.<br> Nice hat.<br> Friends.<br> This is the day that you will always<br> remember as the day that...<br> Idiot. He's nowhere to go<br> but back to the noose.<br> Sail ho!<br> What's your plan of action?<br> Sir!<br> Perhaps on the rare occasion,<br> pursuing the right course<br> demands an act of piracy.<br> Piracy itself can be the right course.<br> Mr. Turner.<br> I will accept the consequences<br> of my actions.<br> This is a beautiful sword.<br> I expect the man who made it<br> to show the same care and devotion<br> in every aspect of his life.<br> Thank you.<br> Commodore! What about Sparrow?<br> I think we can afford to give him<br> one day's head start.<br> So...<br> This is the path you've chosen, is it?<br> After all, he is a blacksmith.<br> No.<br> He's a pirate.<br> Thought you were supposed<br> to keep to the Code?<br> We figured they were more<br> actual... guidelines.<br> Thank you.<br> Captain Sparrow.<br> The Black Pearl is yours.<br> On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands<br> to braces! Let go and haul to run free!<br> Now... bring me that horizon.<br> And really bad eggs<br> Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!<br>
