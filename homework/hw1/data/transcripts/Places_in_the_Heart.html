It seems like<br> we got a problem down...<br> It's all right!<br> I'll be right there, Jack!<br> Sorry to bother you, sheriff,<br> but there's a drunk Negro by the track.<br> - I thought you ought to...<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - With Pa.<br> Royce?<br> No one excused you from the table,<br> young man. You stay here.<br> I won't be gone long.<br> - Who'd you say it was?<br> - That Wylie boy, sheriff...<br> Hey, boys, get on back now,<br> you hear me? You hear?<br> Wylie!<br> Wylie!<br> Howdy, Mr. Royce.<br> Nice day.<br> Wylie, you're drunk as a skunk.<br> I sure am, Mr. Royce.<br> You know better than that.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Royce.<br> - You ready to come with me now?<br> - Just a minute.<br> Wylie, are you done?<br> Royce...<br> Frank!<br> Frank!<br> Frank, give me my doll!<br> Frank.

How you doing?<br> - How's Mrs. Spalding?<br> - She's all right.<br> Excuse me.<br> Vi...<br> You want to take this for a minute?<br> I'll be right back.<br> Here, sug.<br> Come on, you gotta eat something.<br> Marie Thornton made that.<br> It's real good.<br> Margaret.<br> What's gonna happen to us?<br> I can't support this family.<br> I haven't the least idea<br> how to go about it.<br> It seems...<br> like I have never done<br> anything all my life...<br> but raise kids...<br> and take care of this house.<br> Royce paid all the bills.<br> I never even knew how much<br> salary he made.<br> What's gonna happen to us?<br> And thou shalt eat<br> the herbs of the field.<br> In the sweat of thy face<br> shalt thou eat bread...<br> till thou return unto the ground...<br> for out of it wast thou taken.<br> For dust thou art...<br> and unto dust thou shall return.<br> Amen.<br> Lord, I thought those people<br> would never leave.<br> - Margaret, let me get this now.<br> - No, you go on and rest.<br> I'll get that.<br> Evening, ma'am.<br> Excuse me, but I was wondering<br> if you have any work around here?<br> No. There's nothing here.<br> You go on now. Shoo.<br> What is it?<br> I was just asking if you had any<br> chores I can help with.<br> Oh, no, there's no work around here.<br> I can make you a plate of food.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> You wait out by the gate.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Excuse me!<br> Morning!<br> I thought I told you last night<br> you can't stay around here.<br> Well, I seen you was almost<br> out of firewood...<br> so I thought I'd chop some for you.<br> I could fix you some breakfast,<br> but after that, you got to go.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> You know, ma'am...<br> you got a nice henhouse over here.<br> Of course, it's about ready<br> to fall down.<br> A mighty good-looking milk cow.<br> She sure need taking care of, though.<br> There must be close<br> to 40 acres out back.<br> I reckon with the right kind of help...<br> you'd make yourself a handsome<br> living just farming cotton.<br> All you need is somebody like me...<br> who knows most everything there is<br> to know about farming cotton.<br> I was thinking that maybe...<br> I could work around here for food<br> and a place to stay.<br> No. I can't give you any work.<br> I could fix you some breakfast,<br> and then you've got to leave.<br> - No such thing as a job, nowadays.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'll fix you a nice plate of food.<br> You go wait out there<br> and I'll bring it to you, okay?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I can mend this fence with no<br> trouble at all, right after breakfast.<br> Oh, that'd be fine, just fine.<br> Okay. I'll be right out here.<br> Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.<br> Mr. Denby.<br> I hope I'm not bothering you.<br> - No. Won't you come in?<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Please.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mrs. Spalding, on behalf of everyone<br> down at the First Farmers Bank...<br> if there's anything we can do<br> in this hour of need, please ask.<br> Thank you.<br> Mrs. Spalding...<br> I don't know how much your husband<br> told you about his business.<br> But at the close<br> of banking hours yesterday...<br> you had a balance of $116.72.<br> However, when your husband<br> bought this place...<br> he did borrow money from the bank.<br> At the time of his death<br> he still owed...<br> $3681, to be paid twice a year.<br> What that means, Mrs. Spalding, is...<br> come October 15th,<br> you will owe the bank $240.<br> We were wondering if you had any idea<br> how you were gonna make that payment.<br> Yes.<br> Matter of fact, I do.<br> I was thinking...<br> Rilla Langsford and her sister<br> have that nice little gift shop...<br> and, well, I thought I could<br> do the same thing.<br> I could get some pretty little things,<br> and I could set them out...<br> Mrs. Spalding, why would someone<br> come all the way out here...<br> when the Langsfords' place<br> is there on the square?<br> Oh.<br> Mrs. Spalding, what we at the bank<br> suggest is that you sell this place.<br> Now I know times are hard...<br> but maybe we can pay off the loan<br> and have something to tide you over.<br> But where would we live?<br> I believe you have a sister<br> that resides here.<br> No, Margaret couldn't take us in.<br> She couldn't afford it, and besides,<br> she hasn't got room.<br> Mrs. Spalding, when tragedies<br> like this happen...<br> sometimes we have to face up<br> to things that are real hard.<br> Sometimes it's necessary to split<br> families up, temporarily.<br> I believe your husband<br> has some family up in Oklahoma.<br> I'm sure they could take one<br> of your children.<br> I can't talk about this right now.<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> you can let yourself out.<br> I think that just about does the trick.<br> That'll be...<br> 75 cents.<br> I'll see you in a couple weeks.<br> Right. Thank you, Ruby.<br> I didn't know you were busy.<br> That's all right. I was just leaving.<br> - Bye, Ruby.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Kids, come on in.<br> - Hi, Aunt Margaret.<br> Don't touch anything, Possum.<br> Watch your sister.<br> Don't let her touch anything.<br> Mrs. Parks offered to buy<br> five pounds of tomatoes from us.<br> So we thought we'd come by<br> and say hello.<br> Where's Rosalie?<br> I'm sorry.<br> She's gone off with her daddy.<br> But if you go in the kitchen,<br> I got some Coca-Cola in the icebox.<br> - Can we, Mommy?<br> - Yeah, you can.<br> - Frank, split one with your sister.<br> - Okay, Mom!<br> It's all right. You can each have one.<br> - What do you say?<br> - Thank you, Aunt Margaret.<br> Margaret, I've been thinking.<br> Maybe I could work for you.<br> I don't know much about this work,<br> but I could learn.<br> I'm a real good worker.<br> Oh, hon.<br> I hardly got enough customers<br> these days to support me and Wayne.<br> I understand, Margaret.<br> Don't you even think about it.<br> Kids, come on. We got to go.<br> It's getting dark.<br> - Here, I got $28 saved.<br> - I don't want that.<br> Take it. Wayne will just spend it<br> on some fool thing.<br> I don't need it.<br> Come on, kids!<br> - Bye, Aunt Margaret.<br> - Goodbye, Aunt Margaret.<br> I swear you are just like Daddy.<br> You'd think he was sawing off<br> his leg to ask for the least thing.<br> I'll talk to you tomorrow.<br> I'm sorry to bother you so late.<br> We caught this nigger with a bunch<br> of things I think might belong to you.<br> Found him down by the tracks.<br> He claimed he was working for you...<br> but it looks like he was leaving town.<br> No, he's working for me.<br> I needed somebody to help out around<br> here, and so I took on...<br> Moses. Moses Hadnot.<br> I took on Moses to do some chores<br> until I could get straightened away.<br> Mrs. Spalding, are you sure?<br> I mean, I found all that silver on him.<br> Oh, it's Mama's, and Margaret<br> wanted to borrow it.<br> If you had gone straight there and back,<br> you wouldn't have this trouble.<br> Yes'm.<br> Mrs. Spalding,<br> are you sure you're all right?<br> Well...<br> good night.<br> Good night, Jack.<br> Ma'am, I appreciate what you've done...<br> How much could I make<br> if I was to plant cotton?<br> Cotton?<br> Well, last year cotton fetched<br> six cents a pound.<br> You got, say, 30 acres here,<br> you figure...<br> That's 300 and some dollars.<br> If you take out...<br> You sure you can do it?<br> Ma'am, I been chopping cotton<br> since I was 5 years old.<br> I know all there is to know<br> about cotton.<br> All right, you stay in the shed<br> beside the barn.<br> Ma'am, I wanted to say<br> that I appreciate...<br> If you ever steal from me again,<br> I'll shoot you myself.<br> You understand that?<br> Thank you. See you next week.<br> Good to see you.<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Spalding.<br> - Thanks.<br> Hello, Mrs. Spalding.<br> It's nice to see you again so soon.<br> Won't you come right in here?<br> Why don't you take a seat<br> right over there?<br> Mr. Denby...<br> I was wondering if you would...<br> show me how to fill out a check?<br> I never did it before,<br> and I'd best learn how.<br> Certainly, Mrs. Spalding.<br> It's just the simplest thing in the world.<br> Now up here, this is where<br> you put the date.<br> Mr. Denby...<br> I'm thinking it won't be necessary<br> for me to sell my farm after all.<br> Of course it's necessary.<br> I explained all that to you yesterday.<br> - Down here...<br> - I was thinking...<br> if I was to plant cotton...<br> Mrs. Spalding, you don't know a thing<br> about cotton farming.<br> - Yes, I know, but Moses says...<br> - Moses? Who's Moses?<br> He's this Negro man.<br> I don't know any Negro<br> around here named Moses.<br> He was just passing through,<br> and I gave him a job doing some chores.<br> You're telling me you let some Negro<br> hobo talk you into planting cotton?<br> Did you ever hear of the Depression?<br> Now...<br> you see these?<br> These are all foreclosures.<br> And that's just in the last three months.<br> White men who've cotton-farmed<br> all their lives and can't make a go of it.<br> And you listening to some<br> no-account nigger.<br> You'll excuse me, Mrs. Spalding...<br> but that's just about the most<br> ignorant thing I've ever heard.<br> Mr. Denby...<br> I'm not ignorant...<br> and I'm not selling my land.<br> And I'm not giving my children over<br> to anyone else to raise.<br> I'm going out and I'm buying<br> $15 worth of cottonseed.<br> So I'd appreciate it if you would<br> show me again how to write a check.<br> Okay, Mrs. Spalding, that's...<br> Let's see, 450 pound of cottonseed<br> at .03 cent a pound.<br> That comes to...<br> $13.50.<br> - $13.50?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Load up Mrs. Spalding's wagon.<br> - Miz Spalding?<br> - Yes.<br> That ain't the seed you're paying for.<br> He's charging you for grade-A seed,<br> but that's gin-run quality.<br> Something wrong, ma'am?<br> Mr. Simmons, I think maybe<br> you gave us the wrong seed?<br> Well, so I did.<br> That's just an honest mistake,<br> isn't it, boy?<br> Isn't it, boy?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Now you idiots gave Mrs. Spalding<br> the wrong seed.<br> We're lucky her nigger caught it.<br> That's a smart nigger you got there.<br> He's a credit to his race.<br> Why did you have to go shoot off your<br> big mouth in front of that white man?<br> I swear, you ain't never<br> gonna learn nothing.<br> You just got yourself into<br> a carload of trouble.<br> This ain't your land.<br> You just passing through.<br> That white woman ain't nothing to you.<br> These people ain't no reason to get<br> yourself killed.<br> Howdy.<br> Howdy.<br> What's your name?<br> Moses.<br> My name's Frank.<br> - My pa was killed.<br> - I heard about it.

At 3.5 cents a pound...<br> 30 acres, that would be...<br> That comes to $175.<br> Think there's any chance<br> cotton prices'll go back up?<br> How much money you got<br> left in your account?<br> Twenty-four dollars. That's all.<br> - It's not enough for your payment.<br> - I know.<br> I was wondering...<br> What I made from my cotton<br> would cover most of the payment.<br> Could you all...<br> maybe, wait for the rest?<br> That's something only the president<br> of the bank can decide.<br> - You shouldn't get your hopes up.<br> - Could you ask?<br> There ain't no chance<br> you'll ever get that prize money.<br> - It won't work.<br> - It's a hundred dollars.<br> And that plus a crop would be enough<br> to make the payment.<br> You cannot begin to get<br> that cotton picked on time.<br> Why? Moses has said that it's ready.<br> Moses always says things.<br> - It's not always true.<br> - I said cotton comes in early here.<br> But in a couple days...<br> the pickers will get up to this county.<br> They pick it fast<br> as you can say Jack Robinson!<br> - Then we'll start right now!<br> - You got 30 acres to pick.<br> The kids can help.<br> That won't be nearly enough.<br> - I'll pick 24 hours a day.<br> - Did you ever pick cotton?<br> After an hour, the hulls<br> start cutting your fingers.<br> By noon your hands is bleeding.<br> Later your fingers start to swell.<br> Later there ain't no feeling<br> in your hands.<br> I ain't even speaking about<br> what it does to your knees and your back.<br> Get that through your head.<br> Once and for all, we can't do it.<br> Stop thinking about it<br> before you kill yourself!<br> Now you listen to me.<br> If we lose this place,<br> you're going back to begging for meals.<br> They'll put you in a state home.<br> I'll lose what's left of my family.<br> I won't let that happen.<br> I don't care what it takes.<br> I don't care if it kills me.<br> I don't care if it kills you.<br> I won't give up.<br> And if the two of you do,<br> you can go straight to hell!<br> Careful with that now, hon.<br> I bet she isn't ready.<br> All the time we been coming here,<br> she's never been ready.<br> I'm here. I'm coming.<br> I start out an hour early,<br> I always end up a half-hour late.<br> Okay, what can I do to help?<br> Get the cards on top<br> of the chest of drawers.<br> - That looks good.<br> - Want me to do something?<br> Set up the table, would you, Buddy?<br> Let me help you with that, Margaret.<br> Can you find them?<br> Here, let me get the light.<br> Right here.<br> Come on.<br> You want my peanuts, honey?<br> I'll take your six, honey.<br> Discard and rummy.<br> I don't believe you.<br> Thirty-two here.<br> Thirty-two.

We better hire them.<br> - Hire pickers?<br> - With what, Mrs. Spalding?<br> You said yourself you only had<br> $24 in the bank.<br> That ain't near enough<br> to hire 10 pickers.<br> I'll pay them out of the first bale.<br> And what happens<br> if you don't get the first bale in?<br> Then I'll pay them out of the money<br> I get from the gin.<br> If you do that,<br> you'll have hardly any money left.<br> I'll take that chance.<br> We ain't got much time<br> before them pickers in the South...<br> All right, ma'am.<br> You got what you asked for.<br> Have they had breakfast yet?<br> I doubt it.<br> Governor Johnson appealed<br> to President Roosevelt today...<br> for emergency relief due to<br> the failure of the WPA program...<br> to get started in Dallas.<br> The governor had asked<br> the administration...<br> for $1,000,000<br> in direct relief yesterday.<br> Texas was allotted $500,000 instead.<br> Governor Johnson said the situation<br> was becoming critical.<br> Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge...<br> Huey Long's last legislative<br> measures, 37 of them...<br> took a fall last Tuesday,<br> as the administration he left behind him...<br> pushed its investigation<br> of his assassination 10 days ago...<br> by Dr. Carl A.
