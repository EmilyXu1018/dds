Out.<br> What the hell's the matter<br> with you, Taylor?<br> - You are one simple sonofabitch!<br> - I'm sorry, Sergeant.<br> Get that other cherry up here -<br> Gardner. And the doc.<br> Gardner! Doc! Up!<br> Gardner, Doc, to the front!<br> - Gardner, up!<br> - Gardner, up!<br> Gardner, get your ass up the hill,<br> you fat fuck!<br> Hurry up, bubble-butt!<br> You all right?<br> Ants.

Three times this week.<br> I don't know what I'm doing.<br> A gook could be three feet in front of me<br> and I wouldn't know it.<br> I'm so tired.<br> We get up at 5am,<br> hump all day,<br> camp around four or five,<br> dig a foxhole, eat,<br> then put out an all-night ambush<br> or a three-man listening post.<br> It's scary cos nobody tells me<br> how to do anything, cos I'm new.<br> Nobody cares about new guys.<br> They don't even wanna know your name.<br> A new guy's life isn't worth as much<br> cos he hasn't put his time in yet.<br> They say if you're gonna get killed<br> in the Nam,<br> it's better to get it in the first few weeks.<br> The logic being<br> you don't suffer that much.<br> If you're lucky,<br> you stay in the perimeter at night.<br> Then you pull a three-hour guard shift.<br> Maybe you sleep three, four hours<br> a night... But you don't really sleep.<br> I don't think I can keep this up<br> for a year, Grandma.<br> I think I've made a big mistake<br> coming here.<br> We got boo-coo movement.<br> Third Battalion just got hit<br> Charlie had claymores<br> strung up in the trees,<br> blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.<br> Bad shit.<br> Yeah.

You don't have to<br> be a prick every day of your life!<br> Elias, get your men ready.<br> He's in three years and thinks<br> he's Jesus fucking Christ!<br> O'Neill, your short-timers stay in,<br> but you go out. I need veterans out there.<br> Sergeant Barnes.<br> Sergeant.<br> I think, in front of the men,<br> it's necessary for me to give the orders.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.<br> It's gonna piss on us all night.<br> I'm gonna put a serious case of crotch-rot<br> on that ugly face of yours, Junior.<br> Goddamn, man! You break your ass for<br> the white man! No justice around here!<br> What's O'Neill got?<br> A nose up the lieutenant's ass already?<br> How come<br> we always get fucking ambush?<br> Cos it's politics, man, politics.<br> Hey, Chris, I show you a picture<br> of Lucy Jean?<br> No, you didn't.<br> She's the one for me all right,<br> that Lucy Jean.<br> - She's waiting for me.<br> - Real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.<br> - Hey, you got a picture of your girl?<br> - No.<br> I guess that leaves some unlucky girl<br> back at home, don't it?<br> Tuck this in.<br> Shitcan this.<br> Don't need this. Turn around.<br> Come on.<br> Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here<br> on your position.<br> Goddamn it, Elias,<br> don't mess with my pig!<br> I ain't getting greased, so you keep<br> this sorry cheese-dick off my ass!<br> You got Taylor. Gardner, you're with me.<br> Look, case anything happens to you,<br> you get lost or separated,<br> don't yell out, OK?<br> - OK.<br> - Just sit tight and we'll get to you.<br> - All right.<br> - Yo!<br> Saddle up!<br> Lock and load!<br> # I come from Alabama<br> with my banjo on my knee<br> # And I'm going to Louisiana<br> # my true love for to see<br> # Oh, Susanna<br> # Don't you cry for me<br> # For I come from Alabama<br> with my banjo...<br> Mom and Dad didn't<br> want me to come here.<br> They wanted me to be like them:<br> Respectable, hard-working,<br> a little house, a family.<br> They drove me crazy<br> with their goddamn world, Grandma.<br> You know Mom.<br> I guess I've always been<br> sheltered and special.<br> I just wanna be anonymous<br> like everybody else,<br> do my share for my country.<br> Live up to what Grandpa did in the<br> first war, and Dad did in the second.<br> Well, here I am, anonymous,<br> with guys nobody really cares about.<br> Most come from the end of the line,<br> small towns you never heard of.<br> Pulaski, Tennessee.<br> Brandon, Mississippi.<br> Pork Bend, Utah.<br> Wampum, Pennsylvania.<br> Two years' high school's about it.<br> If they're lucky, a job waiting for them<br> back in a factory. Most have got nothing.<br> They're poor. They're the unwanted.<br> Yet they're fighting<br> for our society and our freedom.<br> It's weird, isn't it? At the bottom<br> of the barrel, and they know it.<br> Maybe that's why<br> they call themselves "grunts",<br> cos a grunt can take it,<br> can take anything.<br> They're the best I've ever seen,<br> Grandma. The heart and soul.<br> Hey, Taylor...<br> Hey... cheese-dick, you're up.<br> - What?<br> - You're up.<br> Sure you know how to work<br> the claymores, dude?<br> I'm sure.<br> Flick the safety off<br> and bang on that sucker three times.<br> Three times. I got it.<br> Don't catch any Zs on me, buddy,<br> or I'll sling your sorry ass. You hear me?<br> OK.<br> Maybe I've finally found it<br> way down here in the mud.<br> Maybe from down here<br> I can start up again.<br> Be something I can be proud of<br> without having to fake it,<br> be a fake human being.<br> Maybe I can see something<br> I don't yet see, or<br> learn something I don't yet know.<br> I miss you. I miss you very much.<br> Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.<br> Junior.<br> Junior... Hey.<br> - All right, motherfucker!<br> - It's your shift, man...

I'm hit!<br> Taylor's hit!<br> Oh, shit!<br> - How bad is it?<br> - Dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!<br> Relax, man, it's a scratch.<br> Hold this on here.<br> Don't lie to me, Doc. How bad is it?<br> He let 'em walk right up on us!<br> He was sleeping on his shift!<br> No, I did not.<br> Big Harold, keep an eye on him.<br> Don't let him go into shock.<br> Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!<br> Take the pain!<br> Hey, little guy... you're gonna be OK.<br> OK? Don't worry.<br> Big Harold,<br> do you know if...<br> if you're gonna die?<br> Do you feel like everything's<br> just gonna be fine?<br> Don't gimme that morbid bullshit!<br> You're about to get outta here.<br> They're gonna give you three hot meals<br> a day...

Staying alive.<br> There's been a lot of movement<br> near the Cambodian border.<br> Regiments of NVA moving across.<br> A lot of little firefights, ambushes.<br> We drop bombs, then we walk through<br> the jungle like ghosts in a landscape.<br> Bunker.<br> Where?<br> Roger. Bunkers at point.<br> Two actuals on the way.<br> Bravo Six, Bravo Two. Be advised<br> there is a bunker complex up front.<br> We're on the way down.

Junior, let's go!<br> Lieutenant... tell Six we need engineers.<br> This pos is crawling with traps.<br> On their way. The NVA have been spotted<br> in the village half a klik down the river.<br> - Six says we gotta get there ASAP.<br> - OK.<br> Also, leave four of your men here,<br> and a medic, OK? Move it out.<br> Pull the flanks in! Let's move!<br> - Hey, where's Manny?<br> - Manny?<br> - Hey, Washington!<br> - Manny?<br> - Manny?<br> - Washington!<br> Manny, where you at?<br> We had to get to the village<br> before dark,<br> so we left Elias with some men<br> to keep looking.<br> But it was King who found him,<br> about a thousand yards downriver,<br> not far from the village.<br> It was the end of the mystery.<br> The motherfuckers!<br> The village which had stood<br> for maybe 1,000 years<br> didn't know we were coming that day.<br> If they had, they would've run.<br> Barnes was at the eye of our rage<br> and, through him, our Captain Ahab.<br> He would set things right again.<br> That day we loved him.<br> There he goes, Sarge!<br> - Check him out.<br> - Yeah, you got it, Sarge.<br> Tubbs, Ebenhock, let's go!<br> Get that stupid look off your face!<br> Hey, piggy, piggy!

Let's go.<br> Whaddaya say?<br> Holy shit! Did you see<br> that fucking head come apart, man?<br> I never seen brains like that before, man!<br> I bet you the old bitch runs<br> the whole fucking show, man!<br> She probably cut Manny's throat.<br> Probably cut my balls off if she could.<br> We leave now, and nobody saw a fucking<br> thing! You understand me, Taylor?<br> Come on, man, let's fucking do her!<br> Let's do this whole fucking village!<br> Look at the scars<br> on this gook honcho, Sarge.<br> Get out of here, Tubbs.<br> Where'd he get these wounds?<br> - Says he was hit in a bombing raid.<br> - He's a dink for sure!<br> Ask him why these weapons were here.<br> They had no choice. The NVA killed<br> the old honcho when he said no.<br> - All the rice is theirs.<br> - Bullshit, Lerner!<br> Who the hell was the gook<br> we nailed on the riverbank?<br> He doesn't know. He says NVA ain't<br> been around in a couple of months.<br> - Maybe it was a scout or something.<br> - Yeah, sure, a scout!<br> What about the fucking rice and<br> the weapons? Who are they for?<br> That cocksucker knows<br> what I'm saying, don't you, pop?<br> Goddamn right he does!<br> - He's lying through his teeth!<br> - Waste the fucker!<br> Where the hell's the VC?<br> He swears he doesn't know anything.<br> He hates the NVA, but...<br> What's the bitch saying?<br> She's going on about<br> why we killed the pigs.<br> - They gotta make a living. All that shit.<br> - Jesus!<br> Shut up!<br> Shut the fuck up!<br> You tell him, he starts talking<br> or I'm gonna waste more of 'em!<br> Tell him, Lerner!<br> Hey, Sarge! Let us in on this, all right?<br> Let's go for it!<br> Let's do the whole fucking village!<br> Come on!<br> What the fuck are we waiting for?<br> - Let's do 'em!<br> - Outta my way!<br> This is his daughter, right? Right?<br> You lie! No, you lie! You VC!<br> Barnes!<br> Barnes!<br> What the fuck do you think you're doing?<br> Stay outta this, Elias.<br> This ain't your show.<br> You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!<br> - Get him, Barnes!<br> - Come on, Barnes! Come on, Barnes!<br> Get him!<br> Tear his fucking head off!<br> Break it up!<br> Break it up!<br> Goddamn!<br> You're dead, Elias!<br> I swear to fucking God, you're dead!<br> You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!<br> This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!<br> Break it up! Shut up!<br> Break it up! Listen up!<br> Captain says to torch this place!<br> Torch this place!<br> Blow the weapons in place!<br> Round up all suspected VC<br> and shake it up!<br> - We ain't got much light left!<br> - Lieutenant...<br> - Why didn't you do something?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> You know what the fuck I'm talking about!<br> No, I don't. I don't know what<br> the fuck you're talking about, Elias!<br> All right, move it out! Let's go!<br> Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!<br> Move it out! Police up the weapons,<br> and let's go!<br> Fire in the hole!<br> Fire in the hole!<br> Hey, come on! Morehouse!<br> You fucker! Get outta here!<br> Get the fuck off!<br> Don't do it! Don't do it! You fucker!<br> What is this?<br> - What, you a homosexual, Taylor?<br> - Taylor, she's a fucking dink!<br> She's a fucking human being, man!<br> - Fuck you!<br> - You're a fucking cherry, Taylor!<br> Fucking animal!<br> All of you, you're fucking animals!<br> Fucking lame fuck!<br> You don't belong in Nam, man!<br> Ain't your place at all!<br> You don't fucking get it, do you, man?<br> You just don't fucking get it.<br> It's OK.<br> Get outta there!<br> Fuck you, man.<br> Police up your dicks<br> and let's get outta here.<br> - I didn't see anything, sir.<br> - I did.<br> That dink was reported to me<br> as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.<br> My report will include Lieutenant Wolfe<br> as being witness to the shooting.<br> All right, Elias.<br> Staff Sergeant Barnes.<br> Sir!<br> I want a full report on this<br> when we get back to the CP.<br> You got it, and I can throw in<br> plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.<br> Not now, goddamn it, not now!<br> We'll get into this when we get back<br> to camp. I can promise you something.<br> If I find out there was an illegal killing,<br> there will be a court martial.<br> Right now I need every man in the field.<br> And you two will cease fire.<br> Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias...<br> - You hear me?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> We're back in that NVA bunker complex<br> tomorrow. This time from the east.<br> You people get some rest and be back<br> here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Come on, man.<br> You think these chucks give a fuck<br> about you and me?<br> It could just as well have been you,<br> Harold, if you got in Barnes' way.<br> And that Bunny? That motherfucker's<br> crazy! I mean, he scares me, man.<br> He just scares me.<br> You bloods are getting<br> too hung up on all this shit.<br> These gooks are a lot smarter<br> than you think.<br> You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.<br> They was NVA, every last one of 'em.<br> He's taken us this far, right?<br> He'll take us the rest of the way.<br> A Christian don't go around a village<br> cutting off heads and shit.<br> This shit is really getting outta<br> hand, man. Way outta control.<br> Seems to me that you don't seem<br> to know the difference,<br> the way you shoot up<br> that shit all the time.<br> I don't know, brothers,<br> but I'm hurting real bad inside.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Elias won't be able to prove a thing.<br> - He's a troublemaker.<br> - Elias is a water-walker.<br> Like them politicians in Washington<br> trying to fight this war<br> with one hand tied around their balls.<br> Ain't no need or time<br> for a courtroom out here.<br> - Sarge.<br> - Thanks, Bun.<br> How'd it go there, Bob?<br> Yeah, that-away, Sarge.<br> Fucking Elias, man.<br> He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.<br> He's gonna get everybody<br> in this platoon in deep shit.<br> Somebody oughta frag his ass.<br> So whaddaya think, Bob?<br> Gonna be an investigation or what?<br> Bob?<br> O'Neill, man, you worry too much.<br> Sarge'll take care of it.<br> It's a beautiful night.<br> Yeah. I love this place at night.<br> The stars...<br> There's no right or wrong in 'em.<br> They're just there.<br> That's a nice way of putting it.<br> Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?<br> Barnes believes in what he's doing.<br> And you? Do you believe?<br> In '65... yeah.<br> Now,<br> no.<br> What happened today<br> is just the beginning.<br> We're gonna lose this war.<br> Come on!<br> You really think so? Us?<br> We've been kicking<br> other people's asses for so long,<br> I figure it's time we got ours kicked.<br> Day by day, I struggle to maintain<br> not only my strength, but my sanity.<br> It's all a blur. I have no energy to write.<br> I don't know what's right<br> and what's wrong any more.<br> The morale of the men is low.<br> There's civil war in the platoon.<br> Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.<br> There's a lot of suspicion and hate.<br> I can't believe we're fighting each other<br> when we should be fighting them.<br> Counting days, and the six inches<br> in front of my face. Not much else.<br> Hope things are well, Grandma.<br> Tell Mom and Dad I...<br> Well... just tell them. Chris.<br> Hey, big boy, I know you thought<br> you had that laundry gig all laid out.<br> I gotta paint myself white<br> just to get me one of them fucking jobs!<br> I got my request in for a circumcision!<br> I'm gonna get my big ass outta here!<br> You gonna become a rabbi?<br> Leech.<br> All right!<br> Move it out!<br> Don't drink that, asshole.<br> You're gonna get malaria.<br> Yeah, I hope so!<br> Let's go!<br> Doc! Get up here! Lerner's hit!<br> Sergeant Warren's hit!<br> What the fuck's going on?<br> They got RPGs, man!

Elias, we got four down<br> up there! What do you want me to do?<br> Where the fuck is Red Platoon?<br> Tell those assholes to get up here!<br> - Elias, what the fuck are you!<br> - Listen, Barnes, there's holes here.<br> Third Platoon's coming up here.<br> We're here.<br> Dinks get men in these holes,<br> they got us caught in the crossfire.<br> Sounds pretty far out to me, Elias.<br> I've seen it happen - la Drang in '66.<br> They cut us to fucking pieces!<br> I need three men!<br> - OK, you got 'em. Take off.<br> - Keep pouring off that cover fire.<br> I don't want to be stuck out there<br> with my ass hanging in the breeze!<br> You don't tell me<br> how to run my war, Elias!<br> You go crying and rat-fucking<br> to brigade on your own time!<br> Out here you belong to me! Now, move!<br> You're an asshole, Barnes!<br> Sir, get that asshole O'Neill up here!<br> Two Charlie, this is two! Be advised!<br> Stay down!<br> - Ammo!<br> - Ammo!<br> Sarge! Short round!<br> Medic!<br> Satchel charge!<br> Doc!<br> Doc, help me out!<br> You OK?<br> - Don't leave me, man.<br> - All right.<br> - Hey, Gator... you'll be OK, man.<br> - Don't leave me, man.<br> Gator, hang tough. You'll be OK.<br> Drop your rucks.<br> Taylor, you're coming with us.<br> Please don't go! Don't!<br> You're gonna be OK.<br> - Come on!<br> - Doc! Take care of him, man.<br> Redleg! Redleg!<br> Ripper Bravo Two actual!<br> Adjustment follows!<br> You ignorant asshole! What the fuck<br> coordinates are you giving?<br> You wasted a lot of people up there<br> with your fucked-up fire mission!<br> You know that?<br> You know that? Ah, shit!<br> Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo Two!<br> Check your fire! Check your fire!<br> They're coming.<br> Stagger yourself across this line.<br> Shoot anything that moves.<br> - They'll be coming from over there.<br> - Gotcha.<br> Any one of 'em gets through,<br> we're truly fucked.<br> Where the hell are you going?<br> Down by the river, about 100 metres,<br> in case they try to flank us.<br> Third Platoon's coming up to our rear,<br> so watch for 'em.<br> Can I go with you?<br> No.<br> I move faster alone.<br> Come here. Let's let arty<br> do a little bit of the work here.<br> You tell everybody to pull back<br> to the church.<br> We link up with Third Platoon.<br> You got that?<br> What about Elias?<br> If we pull back, he'll be cut off.<br> You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant!<br> I'll get him.<br> - I got two of them fuckers, man!<br> - I got one!<br> Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dicks!<br> Crawford!<br> Oh, man!<br> Kiss my ass, man!<br> I never thought I'd get hit!<br> It's a lung, babe.<br> You got two of them fuckers.<br> Sarge, a bunch of gooks came through<br> there. We got three of the fuckers!<br> Did you hear the arty shift?<br> We're pulling back.<br> Get the fuck back to church.<br> - Elias is still out there, Sarge!<br> - Taylor, I'll get him!<br> You get Crawford in. Now! Before you<br> Article 15 both your asses! Move!<br> Move it!<br> We still got ya.<br> - Come on, brother.<br> - Medic, where the fuck are you?<br> You're gonna be all right<br> in a minute, brother.<br> Taylor, where are you going?<br> Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon.<br> - Get going.<br> - He's dead?<br> Yeah. He's back there about 100 metres.<br> You saw him? Where?<br> He's dead! There's gooks all over<br> the goddamn place! Get moving!<br> Let's go, let's go, let's go! Move it!<br> Let's go! Move it, move it!<br> OK, let's go!<br> You OK, Harold?<br> You're on the next one. You're OK, bud.<br> Oh, fuck!<br> They've got Elias!<br> What?<br> Back down! Back down there!<br> Snake One-Nine, Fly Four.<br> There's still one of the men down there.<br> Hold your armour!<br> Guns, guns, pull up, pull up!<br> We're trying to cover it on my side.<br> He killed him. I know that he killed him.<br> I saw his eyes when he came back in.<br> How do you know the dinks didn't<br> get him? You got no proof, man.<br> The proof's in the eyes, man. You were<br> there. I know what you were thinking.<br> I say we frag that fucker tonight!<br> I go with that. An eye for an eye.<br> I say let military justice do the job on him.<br> Fuck the military justice!<br> Are you joking me?<br> Who do you think they'll believe?<br> O'Neill? Bunny? Wolfe? Bullshit!<br> Shit, man, you try that,<br> Barnes'll shove it up your ass<br> with a candle on it!<br> What do you suggest we do, huh?<br> I suggest you all watch your own asses!<br> Barnes is gonna<br> be coming down on all of 'em!<br> You gonna forget about Elias and all<br> the good times we done had in here?<br> You're trying to cure the headache<br> by cutting off the head.<br> Elias didn't ask you to fight<br> his battles for him.<br> And if there's a heaven -<br> and, God, I hope there is -<br> I know he's sitting up there drunk as<br> a fucking monkey, and smoking shit,<br> cos he done left his pains down here.<br> You're wrong, man! Any way you cut it,<br> Barnes is a fucking murderer!<br> Taylor...<br> I remember when you first came in here,<br> telling me how you admired the bastard!<br> - I was wrong.<br> - Wrong?<br> You ain't never been right...<br> about nothing!<br> And dig this, you assholes,<br> and dig it good!<br> Barnes has been shot seven times,<br> and he ain't dead!<br> Does that mean anything to you, huh?<br> Barnes ain't meant to die!<br> The only thing<br> that could kill Barnes... is Barnes.<br> Talking about killing?<br> You all experts?<br> You all know about killing?<br> I'd like to hear about it, potheads.<br> You smoking this shit<br> so as to escape from reality?<br> Me, I don't need this shit.<br> I am reality.<br> There's the way it ought to be,<br> and there's the way it is.<br> Elias was full of shit.<br> Elias was a crusader.<br> I got no fight with any man<br> who does what he's told,<br> but when he don't...<br> the machine breaks down.<br> And when the machine breaks down<br> we break down.<br> And I ain't gonna allow that<br> from any of you.<br> Not one.<br> You all love Elias.<br> You wanna kick ass.<br> Well, here I am, all by my Ionesome.<br> And there ain't nobody gonna know.<br> Six of you boys against me.<br> Kill me.<br> I shit on all of you!<br> You motherfucker!<br> - Come on, man, get him!<br> - Oh, fuck!<br> Get him, Chris!<br> Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.<br> You'll go dinky dow in LBJ.<br> Ten years for killing an enlisted man.<br> Ten years climbing<br> the fucking walls, man!<br> Don't do it!<br> Death?<br> What do you all know about death?<br> They sent us back into the valley<br> the next day,<br> about 2000 metres from Cambodia,<br> into a battalion perimeter.<br> It felt like we were returning<br> to the scene of a crime.<br> Alpha Company had been hit hard<br> by a sizeable force<br> and Charlie Company<br> had been probed that night.<br> There were other battalions<br> in the valley,<br> but we knew we were gonna be<br> the bait to lure them out.<br> Somewhere out there<br> was the entire 141 st NVA Regiment.<br> Caught those motherfuckers trying to<br> pull some shit on Charlie Company.<br> They found maps on 'em, man.<br> A friend at Battalion says they had<br> every fucking foxhole fixed on it.<br> Distances... tree lines... our claymores...<br> - Everything.<br> - This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.<br> I also heard<br> we're in fucking Cambodia now.<br> Cambodia? Man, you kidding me!<br> You wanted to see me, sir?<br> Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like<br> you got Elias's squad now.<br> I didn't know we were still referring to<br> this platoon in terms of squads.<br> All right, look... I want you to take<br> those two holes there and there.<br> You're tying it off with Barnes<br> up here, King down there.<br> Begging your pardon, sir.<br> My two holes are far enough apart<br> you could run a regiment through<br> and never see 'em.<br> I got five live bodies left, sir.<br> I don't wanna hear your problems.<br> You'll get new men any day.<br> - Make do like everybody else.<br> - I didn't ask for this job.<br> - I don't wanna hear it.<br> - You don't wanna hear it?<br> That's right. I don't wanna hear it cos, to<br> tell you the truth, I don't give a shit, OK?<br> I don't give a flying fuck any more.<br> Right.<br> I'm glad I ain't going with 'em.<br> Somewhere out there's the beast,<br> and he hungry tonight.<br> What a fuckin' bummer!<br> Ten days and a wake-up<br> and I'm still dealing with this shit.<br> What's the matter with you, man?<br> How come you ain't writing nobody?<br> What about your folks? That grandma<br> you was telling me about?<br> Girl?<br> Got a mother and father, don't you?<br> There must be somebody.<br> Nah, there's nobody.<br> You been smoking too much<br> of this shit, troop.<br> Gotta control that - bring a man down.<br> I remember when you first come out here<br> to the bush. You was green as a...<br> Ever get caught in a mistake that<br> you just can't get out of, King?<br> There's a way out of anything, man.<br> Just keep your pecker hard<br> and your powder dry<br> and the worm will turn.<br> How many days are you short?<br> Nah, it's not just me.<br> It's the way the whole thing works.<br> People like Elias get wasted.<br> People like Barnes go on making up<br> the rules any way they want.<br> So what do we do?<br> Sit in the middle and suck on it.<br> We just don't add up to dry shit, King.<br> Whoever said we did, man?<br> All you got to do is make it outta here<br> and it's all gravy.

How are you doing?<br> Just fine, man! Hey, dig it!<br> We two-timers, man.<br> We gonna get outta here, boy!<br> I'm gonna see you in the hospital.<br> We gonna get high, high! Yes, sir!<br> Sergeant O'Neill!<br> - How are you doing?<br> - Just fine, sir.<br> That's good, cos you got second platoon.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Ready?<br> - You bet.<br> I think now, looking back,<br> we did not fight the enemy,<br> we fought ourselves,<br> and the enemy... was in us.<br> The war is over for me now,<br> but it will always be there,<br> for the rest of my days,<br> as I'm sure Elias will be,<br> fighting with Barnes for what Rhah<br> called possession of my soul.<br> There are times since<br> I've felt like the child<br> born of those two fathers.<br> But be that as it may,<br> those of us who did make it<br> have an obligation to build again,<br> to teach to others what we know,<br> and to try with what's left of our lives<br> to find a goodness,<br> and meaning, to this life.<br>
