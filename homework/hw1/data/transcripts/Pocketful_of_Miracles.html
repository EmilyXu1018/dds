Apples!<br> Tallulah!<br> Tallulah, good luck tonight!<br> Apples! Apples, madam?<br> Buy an apple? An apple, madam?<br> Apples? Apples?<br> Apples?<br> Apples... Apples...<br> Apples... Apples...<br> Apples... Apples...<br> Apples... Apples...<br> - Where'd you pick him up?<br> - He's the new fella.<br> - Working the subway, huh?<br> - He didn't pay you yet, did he?<br> I gave you five bucks last month.<br> Five bucks every month<br> if you work Broadway, buster.<br> Hey, that's seven. Two of that's mine.<br> Yeah, Soho.<br> A nice long letter.<br> - Did it come today?<br> - Yeah. I'll pass it around.<br> Now get going over to the Casino.<br> There's a matinee.<br> New joke?<br> - Hi, Smiley.<br> - Hi, Annie. Been looking for you.<br> Dave the Dude wants to see you<br> at Rudy Martin's.<br> - Happy days...<br> - Annie...<br> - I ain't paid this month. I'm a little short.<br> - Sure you are.<br> Comes Christmas time, what you beg<br> you put in the Santa Claus box.<br> - I know. I'm a sucker.<br> - You are.<br> - Any mail?<br> - Yeah. Over at the Casino.<br> Don't forget the Dude.<br> - Thanks, Annie.<br> - Aw, shut up.<br> P- racticality<br> D- oesn't interest me<br> Love the life that I lead<br> I've got a pocketful of miracles<br> And with my pocketful of miracles<br> One little miracle a day is all I need<br> T- roubles more or less<br> B- other me, I guess<br> When the sun doesn't shine<br> But there's that pocketful of miracles<br> And with my pocketful of miracles<br> The world's a bright and shiny apple<br> That's mine, all mine<br> Dude sent word he wants me.<br> On top of everything else,<br> this one shows up.<br> All right. You got 14 fifths of Scotch...<br> Just sit down, Annie. Five of the bourbon...<br> You know, Joy Boy, this morning was<br> the first time I ever been to a funeral.<br> - Do you believe there's a life after?<br> - Five of the gin and...<br> Why are you sittin' there like a dummy?<br> Why don't you write it down?<br> If I could write I'd be in the navy.<br> Where's the Dude?<br> What is it with you?<br> You can't wait 12 seconds?<br> You got an appointment<br> at the beauty parlour with that mop?<br> Here, give me that. I'll write, you count.<br> If I could count I'd be in the army.<br> Why don't you laugh? It's funny.<br> If I could laugh I wouldn't have heartburn.<br> Wanna know why Rudy Martin<br> was found in the river? There it is.<br> 50 G's worth of I.O.Thems<br> to the gambling boys. Hello, Annie.<br> There's a note. "Thanks for everything.<br> Take care of my baby Queenie."<br> - What's "baby Queenie"?<br> - Maybe he left you a horse.<br> - There's a Queenie running at Hialeah.<br> - That's right. Hey, Powder!<br> - Thanks a lot. You did a good job in there.<br> - For you, Dude, any time, boy.<br> Annie, is that the biggest apple you got?<br> I need a triple shot of luck today.<br> This apple'll make<br> the birds sing for you again.<br> I tell you, kid, you get another sucker<br> like my boss, you can retire altogether.<br> This could only happen<br> to a smart guy like you.<br> There's a man who owns a joint,<br> gets knocked off owing you $20,000.<br> And on top of that, you get stuck<br> for the funeral bill. Go figure that.<br> Fine thing you did,<br> giving a poor soul a Christian burial.<br> Here's luck for you.<br> Something good's gonna happen<br> to you now. Something real good.<br> Yeah. You could break a leg.<br> You give up panhandling,<br> I'll give up bootlegging,<br> and you and me will run this speak<br> together. Could be a gold mine, Annie.<br> No, I'm not kidding, Annie.<br> Come on, let's see your gams.<br> - Oh, boy. Whoopee!<br> - How about that, huh?<br> - Hello, suckers!<br> - You old chiselling moocher.<br> - Here. Here's a fiver for your apple.<br> - God bless you, Dude.<br> Annie, will you tell me, why do I always<br> believe that your apples bring me luck?<br> Can you tell me?<br> Because the little people like you.<br> - What little people?<br> - Oh, you can't see 'em.<br> They live in dreams.<br> Little people like me, huh? Why?<br> Because they like children,<br> beggars and poets.<br> And that makes me a poet?<br> You want to believe in something.<br> Right now it's my apple.<br> So, the little people jump in it, see?<br> That's why this apple will bring you luck.<br> Why, you old con dame. Here's<br> the only thing you believe in.<br> - There you go, Annie.<br> - God bless you, Dude. God bless you.<br> - And bring you luck straightaway.<br> - All right.<br> Hey, Annie! You stay away<br> from those gin bottles. You hear me?<br> - I never touch it.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> - Are you Mr Dave the Dude?<br> - I am. Don't drip on my suit.<br> What is this? Grand Central? Junior,<br> close that door. There's liquor in here.<br> You lookin' for a job in the chorus, kid?<br> The joint's closed, so try someplace else.<br> - And lock it!<br> - I read this in a Maryland paper.<br> "Rudy Martin, gangland victim,<br> was buried today."<br> "Dave the Dude arranged his funeral."<br> - Maryland? Old Rudy really got around.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> If you got money comin' to you, the Dude<br> is not pickin' up the tab for Rudy's bills.<br> - Now be a nice girl. Take a walk. Bye.<br> - Rudy Martin was my father.<br> You're Rudy's kid?<br> - You're Queenie?<br> - Yeah. Well, that's what Papa called me.<br> Hey! She ain't a horse!<br> - Why didn't you show at the funeral?<br> - I just read about it.<br> - You ain't pulling a fast one on me?<br> - Mr Dude, I'm here because of you.<br> Papa came to see me last month<br> and he was very worried.<br> He said "Queenie, if anything happens<br> to me, here's the lease to my club."<br> "Give it to Dave the Dude. He's a right guy<br> and I've got to pay him back."<br> So here it is. It's all signed and everything.<br> That's very nice,<br> but the joint's in hock up to here.<br> The inventory won't pay for the flowers,<br> so the lease is worth about a quarter.<br> Miss Martin, "Papa" owes me $20,000,<br> and a lot more to some guys<br> who don't laugh so easy.<br> - That much?<br> - That much.<br> Well, I've got a few dollars in the bank.<br> What I make at the cafeteria,<br> I could manage five dollars a week.<br> - A cafeteria?<br> - I'm cashier there.<br> The next one Howard... uh, Mr Porter<br> opens, I'm gonna be manager.<br> Then I could give you a little more.<br> - It's five whole dollars.<br> - The lucky apple is working already.<br> - Very big.<br> - It's the best I can do.<br> Goodbye, Mr Dude.<br> Thank you for being Papa's friend.<br> Yeah. I mean...<br> That's the first broad I ever seen<br> who wanted to do something for you.<br> You know, maybe...<br> - Miss?<br> - Hey, Dude! No! Come here!<br> You know, at $5 a week it'll take you<br> 200 years to pay off your father's debt.<br> - I don't care if it takes a thousand years.<br> - Take it easy. I got an idea.<br> For my boss it was the lucky<br> apple that brought Queenie into his life.<br> Go figure - he's got a thing<br> about Annie's apples.<br> So the Dude shoots the bankroll and<br> promotes Queenie into a nightclub star.<br> Much to my surprise she ain't too bad.<br> And you know what?<br> The club begins to make money.<br> And Queenie begins to pay off<br> her papa's debts. Go figure that one.<br> By the second year,<br> the club is a sensation.<br> We're in the big dough.<br> Step back. The elevator's coming up.<br> We're gettin' so big, the opposition<br> begins playin' games with us.<br> The Dude kisses the old apple,<br> but I know better: I kiss the iron doors.<br> But it was too good to last.<br> Suddenly the law pulls the rug out<br> from under us bootleggers.<br> - Another dollar?<br> - Stop squawkin', stop squawkin'.<br> I only raised you one buck.<br> Tonight you can afford it.<br> Liquor's legal.<br> The whole town's on a binge.<br> - Baby, baby, baby<br> - Baby, baby, baby<br> - Baby, baby, baby<br> - Baby, baby, baby<br> - I love you<br> - I love you<br> Hope you love me too<br> Ooh!<br> All right, you wonderful<br> bunch of ex-lawbreakers.<br> This is the last night, the last song,<br> and the last bottle's on the house!<br> Hurray!<br> Does that mean we'll be playin', Dude?<br> - You are a genius. You are a genius!<br> - I know. Now tell me what happened.<br> - The big man is here.<br> - I told you so, huh?<br> - And he's waitin' for you.<br> - Let him wait.<br> - What man?<br> - I told you to find Apple Annie.<br> I spread the word with the BBC -<br> Beggars' Broadcast...<br> - Move it!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What are you gonna do? Wait around for<br> some apple? What's the matter with you?<br> Listen, Dave. The big man don't wait easy.<br> He could get very nasty.<br> - He could put on them dark cheaters.<br> - I'm not leaving here until I get my apple.<br> All right. OK.<br> I'll go look in a few gutters myself.<br> Herbie!<br> Shh!<br> - Did you get it?<br> - Don't I always?<br> - Classiest stationery in the house.<br> - God bless you, Herbie.<br> A blind man could read that.<br> "Hotel Marberry."<br> - Give it to me.<br> - When are you expecting another letter?<br> The mail boat comes in tomorrow.<br> You know, I could get fired<br> for stealing your letters.<br> Herbie, you mustn't get fired.<br> Please don't get fired.<br> Who keeps writing you<br> from Spain, anyway?<br> None of your business.<br> A heavy lover, eh, Annie?<br> Yeah. King Alfonso.<br> But keep it quiet.<br> The queen gets very jealous.<br> Well!<br> It's been two years I've been waiting<br> for one like that. Come here, you.<br> Oh, Queenie.<br> Mmm...<br> - Dude...<br> - Mmm? What?<br> The doorknob's killing me.<br> The doorknob, huh?<br> You gorgeous stack of cupcakes.<br> Come here.<br> - Now, Dude...<br> - Come on now, Queenie. You started this.<br> I was trying to thank you for everything.<br> That's the way to kill a man,<br> not thank him. Come here.<br> - What's this? A party?<br> - It's the Fourth of July.<br> - In December?<br> - It's freedom day for both of us.<br> - You're through selling liquor.<br> - Now it's legal, it's no fun.<br> - I sold the club today.<br> - You did?<br> Did you bring 'em? Papa's IOUs?<br> I brought 'em.<br> There you are.<br> The last of Papa's debts.<br> Now we put them in the Easter fire<br> and we burn the past.<br> - Now you can make it Christmas, Dude.<br> - Happy New Year. How?<br> By saying you meant it<br> when you asked me to marry you.<br> Honey, I'll marry you.<br> I'll fight Dempsey, kiss a cop, anything.<br> Let's get started. Two years is a long wait.<br> Saturday, darling.<br> 10am Saturday we get married. It's all set.<br> You're kidding. Really married? Us?<br> The real us. No more Dude and<br> no more Queenie. To David and Elizabeth.<br> Mr and Mrs Conway of Silver Springs,<br> Maryland, and their flock of children.<br> - Maryland?<br> - Yeah.<br> You know the house I was born in?<br> I bought it for us a year ago.<br> - You keep a secret real good.<br> - Honey, I want to be married there,<br> in Mama's wedding dress<br> by the preacher who married them.<br> Maybe I should go out and get my violin.<br> It's sappy, I know. But let me be sappy.<br> I'm sick of being Queenie Martin.<br> Reverend Morgan's still down there.<br> He's 81 years old and he's still<br> conducting Sunday services.<br> Dude, when I located him on the phone,<br> he cried. Can you imagine?<br> I cried too. It was the wettest<br> long-distance call...<br> Are you crying? I've never seen you cry.<br> When I'm happy -<br> when I'm really happy - I'm a Niagara.<br> OK, Elizabeth. To us.<br> To the wedding in your mother's wedding<br> dress... by the 81-year-old preacher.<br> - Oh, Dude, Niagara's coming!<br> - Watch it. This stuff burns holes, baby.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> Oh, Queenie...<br> Dude, Annie's here. Let's go.<br> - Annie?<br> - I'll be right out!<br> What do you need an apple for?<br> What more luck do we need?<br> You just gave me a wedding present -<br> the place in Maryland.<br> I'm gonna give you one.<br> An all-year house on a silver platter.<br> - The whole city of New York.<br> - I don't want New York.<br> I want a little town in Maryland<br> where I can play the wife-and-mother bit.<br> You can shake this.<br> You didn't want it in the first place.<br> - But I'm a man who needs a little action.<br> - Action?<br> Prohibition's over.<br> Hey, Dude, the man is waitin'.<br> - All right, all right.<br> - What man? Who are you seeing tonight?<br> I'm making a meet with our future,<br> sweetheart. Mr Big himself.<br> - Not Darcey?<br> - You're right. Darcey.<br> Dude, no. You're not going to Chicago?<br> No. The mountain is coming to the Dude.<br> I'm not going to Chicago.<br> Darcey in New York?<br> The police said they'd never let him in.<br> They didn't let him in. I did.<br> Please, not Darcey. He's an animal.<br> He's a murderer. He's Public Enemy No. 1.<br> - It's all headlines.<br> - Dude, will you move it? Let's go.<br> Your car's outside. We can be in Maryland<br> by morning. We can make it legal.<br> If you love me,<br> don't depend on some witch's apples.<br> - Let's get away. We'll be real people.<br> - Simmer down, sweetheart. Come on.<br> We go out into the sticks,<br> what kind of work am I gonna do?<br> You're young.<br> You can make a name, money...<br> What's money? I started at the bottom in<br> this town and I'm going right up to the top.<br> I can outsmart those monkeys.<br> I've been doing it all my life.<br> Ever since I escaped from that orphanage.<br> And why? Because I'm good<br> and because I'm lucky.<br> I'm gonna be somebody,<br> and you're gonna be somebody with me.<br> I'm coming.<br> Dude, if you shack up with Darcey<br> you can forget the wedding.<br> Isn't she gorgeous?<br> - Heads.<br> - Oh...!<br> - What's grabbin' her?<br> - It's nothing. She just wants a lot of kids.<br> Kids? Boy, they're mean<br> when they get on that kick.<br> Annie, where you been?<br> Playing Chase Me Charlie?<br> And where were you Saturday?<br> I couldn't beat a race.<br> God bless you, Dude.<br> I wasn't feelin' so hot Saturday.<br> - Ginned up again?<br> - No, Dude. Honest, I'm off the stuff.<br> About time. Dr Michel says<br> your kidneys are shot.<br> Aw, pooh. My kidneys are<br> as good as new - better.<br> You think we could postpone<br> this discussion of Annie's kidneys?<br> Lots of luck, Dude.<br> Save a lot of trouble<br> if you bought the whole basket at once.<br> I gotta buy these apples<br> one at a time just before I need 'em.<br> We were both bums<br> until we found that out.<br> Let's go. Pick-up point, the warehouse.<br> God bless Dave the Dude.<br> God bless all my friends.<br> That's the boss.<br> - Dude's here. Set?<br> - Set.<br> - He's got his dark cheaters on, boss.<br> - Uh-oh.<br> You're late.<br> Late for what?<br> Late for what? For 48 hours I've been<br> knocking around in this cage<br> all the way from Chicago.<br> I'm seasick.<br> Don't any of you guys ever inhale?<br> Like being in solitary, only it moves.<br> Fine thing, some two-bit operator<br> sends for me in his upholstered boxcar<br> and first thing you know, I'm being hauled<br> all over the country like a side of beef.<br> - This your layout?<br> - Yeah. I built it.<br> See these walls? Bulletproof.<br> In town it's neutral territory, even when<br> there's a war on. I call it Little Switzerland.<br> What do the cops call it? They find me<br> in this town, you can stop the presses.<br> There's ten vans just like this hauling<br> real furniture around. Here you're safe.<br> That picture's ten years old.<br> Relax, Darcey. Take it easy. Be my guest.<br> Your guest? Ever occur to you that I could<br> also be your prisoner? Ever think of that?<br> Yeah, I gave it a quick think.<br> Maybe you'd better give a long think<br> to a guy by the name of Stiff Arm Sam.<br> He once thought he could hold me too.<br> Stiff Arm? The guy<br> that walks around like this?<br> Yeah, with the blowtorch in the armpits.<br> That's right.<br> That's my idea, the blowtorch.<br> It must've hurt.<br> It's against the law to carry firearms<br> in New York, Darcey. Right, Joy Boy?<br> That's right. Here in New York<br> you gotta have a permit.<br> - Nothin', boss.<br> - Yeah. It's beginnin' to figure.<br> They tell me you've been operatin'<br> ten years in this town without a pinch.<br> Yeah. Luck, Mr Darcey. Pure luck.<br> I heard about the luck bit.<br> The thing with the lucky apples.<br> The wise guys figure<br> that's two strikes against you.<br> - Oh?<br> - Yeah.<br> They say you gotta buy them lucky apples<br> off of some little old lady, right?<br> And if something happens to her...<br> Could be like Samson<br> gettin' his first haircut.<br> Look, Darcey. I got news for you.<br> You see these apples?<br> I buy 'em by the crate<br> at the nearest grocery store.<br> The wise guys want to believe<br> these apples bring me luck,<br> it's two strikes against them.<br> You know about psychology, huh?<br> Yeah, I know about... whatever you call it.<br> It's like your dark glasses. You put those<br> on, the boys sweat from here to Omaha.<br> Me? I use apples.<br> All right. Shall we quit clowning?<br> I like the way this kid operates, yeah.<br> Smart boy. Smart dresser, too.<br> - You like that?<br> - Oh, yeah. It's rich.<br> - He likes it.<br> - Mind if I try that on?<br> No. Why not? Give him a hand, Junior.<br> Hold it, Junior.<br> They say you're a smart operator.<br> Gotta give you credit. You won the first<br> round. This is round two comin' up now.<br> - How does it look?<br> - Great.<br> Nice colour, huh?<br> Round two.<br> I got maybe eight, ten<br> top candidates for this job.<br> All smart, tough, hard-headed guys,<br> and I can take my pick of any one of 'em.<br> Now suppose you tell me,<br> in ten words or less, like a telegram,<br> why should Steve Darcey give<br> the New York territory to Dave the Dude?<br> Go ahead, talk.<br> - That's a good question. Right, Joy Boy?<br> - Beautiful.<br> - Got an answer?<br> - No.<br> - Got a question?<br> - Yeah.<br> Ask it - in ten words, like a telegram.<br> Why should Dave the Dude<br> give New York territory to Darcey?<br> That's eleven, but...<br> - Are you his mouthpiece?<br> - Call me his doormat.<br> Why don't you lay down and act like one?<br> Darcey, Joy Boy happens to be my friend,<br> and all my friends are nine feet tall<br> and make very bad doormats.<br> You bootleggers, you were nine feet tall.<br> All big fish in a little pond, but all of<br> a sudden all the little ponds are dryin' up.<br> That's where the king comes in.<br> I'm makin' me a national syndicate.<br> I'm gonna push some of you<br> gaspin' sharks back in the water.<br> But it's gonna be my water.<br> It'll cover the whole country.<br> - Deep water.<br> - Deep, huh?<br> How deep? Dames? Dope?<br> That's a little over my head.<br> Come on. That's bush league.<br> We're gonna operate<br> from presidential suites.<br> We're gonna elect judges,<br> contribute to charities, finance operas.<br> We're gonna be in<br> the big, profitable business<br> of catering for all human weaknesses.<br> - What would be my cut?<br> - Your cut? The New York territory?<br> Right down the middle.<br> If you're the right guy.<br> He's the only guy.<br> There's one more little detail. We request<br> the franchise holders to put up $50,000.<br> In small bills.<br> As a token of their good faith.<br> - Who's driving?<br> - Herman.<br> - Herman?<br> - Yeah.<br> Take Mr Darcey anywhere he wants to go<br> while he's in town. He's my guest.<br> - Drop me off at the nearest goods stop.<br> - OK, boss.<br> Wait a minute. You're not interested?<br> No, not right now.<br> Because, you see, this is one fish<br> that isn't jumping into anybody's pond<br> unless I'm paid $100,000 in cash<br> as a token of your good faith.<br> You want the syndicate to pay you?<br> I'm the lucky one, remember?<br> All right, boys, let's go. We got<br> some ponds that need watering real bad.<br> Oh, if you get an itch for any of those<br> human weaknesses yourself, just holler.<br> This is my town, Darcey.<br> Wait a minute. Like I said, I like your style.<br> But you know the rules<br> as good as I do, kid.<br> The king makes an offer, the king<br> gets turned down, the king loses face.<br> On a king that coat looks good.<br> Wear it.<br> Sheeh!<br> That guy is gonna play on my side<br> or he ain't gonna play at all.<br> If it was me, I'd warm up the blowtorch.<br> - Any mail?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> Ooh! He uses a blowtorch on people?<br> What does he do - weld 'em?<br> King. I don't like that guy.<br> Be fun to take him apart, huh, Joy Boy?<br> Be a load of laughs.<br> All the way up to our funeral.<br> Scat.<br> Scat. Scat.<br> Lying all over my poor baby's picture.<br> As if it were the only place to sleep.<br> My... darling...<br> Louise.<br> I just love Annie's music.<br> ...the reception...<br> I gave...<br> for...<br> for... Lord... Ferncliffe.<br> Here's to Lord Ferncliffe.<br> "You will notice I have increased<br> your allowance this year."<br> "It breaks my heart that I have not<br> been able to see you all these years,<br> but Dr Michel still insists<br> an ocean voyage could be fatal."<br> The old crab.<br> "Your stepfather thought he might<br> be able to make the trip this year."<br> You didn't know you had<br> a stepfather, did you?<br> Neither did I.<br> "The young man you wrote about<br> sounds perfectly divine."<br> "I hope he loves you<br> as much as you love him."<br> And as much as I love you,<br> my darling.<br> Herbie, the boat's in. Did you...<br> Where's your uniform?<br> You gin-guzzling witch.<br> On account of you I got the sack.<br> - Herbie, you can't get fired.<br> - Can't, eh?<br> They caught me putting<br> your lousy letter in my pocket.<br> - Where is it?<br> - What am I gonna tell my old lady?<br> - Where's my letter?<br> - I don't know. They took it away from me.<br> Annie.<br> Annie! You can't go in there! Annie!<br> You must be in the wrong place, ma'am.<br> Pedlars aren't allowed.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Oh, my gracious stars.<br> I have some mail here. A letter?<br> From Barcelona, Spain?<br> - A letter?<br> - It came for me this morning.<br> Are you stopping here, my good woman?<br> No, I'm not.<br> But I do have a letter here. Please.<br> - What is your name?<br> - Mrs E Worthington Manville.<br> Mrs E Worthington Manville?<br> Wait here.<br> Mrs E Worthington Manville.<br> Good afternoon, Mrs Manville.<br> Is there anything I can do for you?<br> There's a letter here for me.<br> I'd like to get it.<br> A letter? Addressed<br> to the Hotel Marberry?<br> Yes. I told that fella all about it.<br> Are you sure you're not mistaken,<br> my dear lady?<br> No, I'm not mistaken. I've been<br> getting my letters here for years.<br> Madam, you're not a guest<br> of the Marberry, are you?<br> - Of course not. Any fool could see that.<br> - Please, there's no necessity for shouting.<br> Then why don't you give me my letter?<br> Why keep asking stupid questions?<br> Madam, I'm compelled to ask you<br> to leave these premises.<br> - No. Not till I get my letter.<br> - Shall I call the police, Mr Cole?<br> Send for the police. I'm no criminal.<br> I haven't done anything.<br> Please, mister.<br> I don't want to make any trouble.<br> I just want my letter, that's all.<br> It's from my daughter, see.<br> It came all the way from Spain. She...<br> She thinks I'm somebody.<br> Please?<br> Lloyd.<br> Yes, Mr Cole?<br> Do you recall a letter<br> addressed to a Mrs Manville?<br> - Mrs E Worthington Manville.<br> - E Worthington...<br> Why, yes. It came this morning.<br> - You see? I told you.<br> - Let her have it.<br> God bless you. God bless you!<br> - What are you waiting for? Get the letter.<br> - But I sent it back.<br> - You sent it back?<br> - I returned it marked "Party not known".<br> You can't send it back. She'll find out<br> that I don't live here. Don't you see?<br> Shh. Please.<br> - Has the mail gone out yet?<br> - Yes. The boy picked it up a twinkle ago.<br> Look. There he is now.<br> Boy!<br> Boy! Yoo-hoo! Stop!<br> She can't do that in here. Stop her.<br> Don't put any more letters in that box!<br> Where do you think you are? Madam!<br> There it is. I'd know it anywhere.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Leave this hotel at once.<br> Here.<br> Bless you, sir.<br> My letter. Where's my letter?<br> - Grab my hand.<br> - Grab her hand. Here we go. Up.<br> - I'm all right. Let me go.<br> - There you are.<br> Just as I said:<br> With Prohibition repealed,<br> you'll see our streets<br> full of nasty old drunks like that.<br> Listen, Flyaway. Are you the smartest<br> agent in town, or you're just a lot of talk?<br> Your butter I don't need.<br> You want four bodyguards?<br> They get 100 a week, I get 100.<br> - With guns.<br> - Then I get 200.<br> - Why you? They got the guns.<br> - What's guns? I got the permits.<br> All right. They gotta be from out of town,<br> dress nice and only shoot in self-defence.<br> You want four Tom Mixs.<br> - You don't owe me a favour?<br> - Do I owe you a movie star?<br> You were in deep trouble.<br> I sneaked you out of town in Little Switz.<br> - What do you want? My wife?<br> - Which one?<br> Who do you want protected?<br> But he can't know nothin' about it.<br> The boss.<br> The Dude? I wouldn't do that<br> for one million dollars!<br> - Hey, what are you talkin' about?<br> - The Dude is hot.<br> I never was here.<br> Get yourself the marines.<br> What? Hey, you creep,<br> where are you goin'?<br> It was all over town in two minutes.<br> He insulted a king.<br> King? What king?<br> Who remembers faces?<br> I don't remember...<br> - Queenie.<br> - It was open.<br> - Where's the king of New York?<br> - Where you been?<br> The Dude's lookin' for you.<br> He read Winchell.<br> Just returning a few items<br> I won't need any longer.<br> Two kings of New York, and one needs<br> a bodyguard? He ain't my client.<br> Flyaway, stay here. I gotta talk to you.<br> Hey, Flyaway, there's a 10G bonus.<br> Hello.<br> Junior, what do you want?<br> I am here with two representatives<br> of our out-of-town friend, Mr Bigelow.<br> - Bigelow? What Bigelow?<br> - The Chicago Big... elow.<br> He wants to see the boss right away<br> to negotiate a deal.<br> Holy cow. The deal is still on<br> and the Dude ain't here.<br> Look, Junior, you gotta stall 'em,<br> because I gotta think in my head.<br> Tell him to hurry up.<br> Mr B has a touch of mal de mer.<br> Mal de what?<br> Oh, you mean seasickness.<br> Just get the car and come right over.<br> Wait a minute. He's gonna need an apple.<br> Stop off at Schubert Alley, get the bag and<br> her apples. Don't stop to play stickball.<br> - You. There you are.<br> - Hey, Dude. The man's on the phone.<br> The man wants to negotiate a deal!<br> - Is this true, what I read in Winchell's?<br> - I suppose you can read.<br> Why, you two-timing dame. Are you<br> leaving me for that cafeteria clown?<br> Yeah. The wedding's Saturday.<br> You two-timing dame.<br> You ain't even been one-timed!<br> You ain't walking out on me<br> after what I did for you.<br> I took you from nothing<br> and made you into something.<br> So I could become a gangster's<br> flashy moll? Not me, mister!<br> You ain't walking out on me. You hear me,<br> Queenie? I'm Dave the Dude.<br> I'm not walking. I'm running!<br> Now you listen to me, Queenie. Watch it!<br> - You...!<br> - Watch it, Queenie.<br> - What are they doing?<br> - Playing house. What, are you still here?<br> - The bodyguards. I just thought of four...<br> - Look, I'm a busy man.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Take a walk! Out!<br> Flyaway!<br> No, you're not going out that door.<br> You owe me one thing, Queenie,<br> and I'm gonna collect.<br> You ain't leaving here<br> with that halo still on your head.<br> This place is like the inside<br> of a goat's stomach. Hey, Dave? Dave?<br> Hey, Dave. Look, I don't wanna butt in.<br> Excuse me for interruptin', Dave, but...<br> - Dave...<br> - Man, you have the worst sense of timing.<br> I hate to interrupt,<br> - but I just got a message from Junior.<br> - From Darcey? What did he say?<br> - Get me a pair of pants.<br> - Change your own diaper!<br> I said pants me! And fix yourself up.<br> Make yourself decent. What'd he say?<br> In front of her?<br> She's marrying JP Cafeteria.<br> I don't care if she marries J Edgar Hoover.<br> Now what did he say?<br> Dave, I could hardly believe it, but Darcey<br> wants to meet with you again, right away.<br> - Didn't I tell you he'd come around?<br> - Yeah, that he'd come around.<br> Look, this is worth millions. Let's not<br> blow the whole cake to win a little crumb.<br> Will you stop worrying?<br> - Others pay him. Why should he pay you?<br> - I'm Dave the Dude, not one of the others.<br> - Now go get Annie.<br> - Yeah, go get Annie.<br> That's all taken care of.<br> Junior's bringing her over right now.<br> Why don't you look where you're going?<br> Yeah.<br> - We're on our way.<br> - You're keepin' Darcey waitin'.<br> - So let him wait.<br> - You can't. The man is king.<br> The king loses face, our heads<br> go on display in the marketplace.<br> You've been reading books again.<br> Where the hell is Annie?<br> Annie. Annie!<br> Big shots. Big dopes!<br> Your life depends on a beggar's apples,<br> and this superstitious heel...<br> - Are you still here?<br> - You'll wind up in the federal pen.<br> Or swimming with your feet<br> in cement, like Papa.<br> - That's why I'm marrying Howard Porter.<br> - Don't keep the groom waiting.<br> - Not another minute!<br> - Get back in there.<br> - If I could only cry!<br> - Queenie!<br> Dude, I can't find Apple Annie anywhere.<br> She ain't nowhere, I'm telling you.<br> I hope she croaks!<br> What do you mean,<br> you can't find her anywhere?<br> All you gotta do is ask<br> any panhandler on Broadway.<br> - There ain't no panhandlers on Broadway.<br> - What?<br> There ain't a beggar on the street.<br> It's scary. It's like Broadway was naked.<br> I'm ashamed to look at it.<br> Hi, Mr Dude, fellas.<br> Well, the Easter Parade's<br> a little early this year.<br> - No panhandlers on Broadway, huh?<br> - I didn't see 'em before, boss.<br> - I should drop dead...<br> - Maybe you should.<br> It's only an expression.<br> - Any of you crumbs seen Apple Annie?<br> - Yeah, I saw her.<br> One at a time. You.<br> - It's about Annie.<br> - What about Annie?<br> - She's in a pickle.<br> - Pickled. I can believe that.<br> Mallethead saw her on the waterfront,<br> in the water looking.<br> She was stumblin' along, talkin' to herself.<br> She was sobbing.<br> It's good I ran into her.<br> - So she got a package on.<br> - It's worse than bein' swacked.<br> She was swiping stationery<br> from the Marberry Hotel.<br> - And writin' letters to her daughter.<br> - Daughter? That old bag?<br> She's a woman, ain't she?<br> - What's this about a daughter?<br> - Annie's got a daughter in Spain.<br> Raised in a convent since she was a baby.<br> - She's comin' to visit, bringing a count.<br> - She's gonna marry a count or somethin'.<br> - What is this, a rib?<br> - Annie sends her money every month.<br> And we've been lettin' her<br> shake us down cos we knew.<br> We all are godfathers.<br> We all got a piece of the kid.<br> We figure you're a godfather too.<br> You got the biggest piece.<br> - Me?<br> - You give Annie big tips for her apples.<br> - It's why her apples were lucky for you.<br> - We got a business appointment to keep.<br> - You keep it. Just stall 'em.<br> - How am I gonna stall 'em?<br> I'll be along as soon as I get my apple.<br> Now move it. Move it.<br> - Where is Annie?<br> - At her flop. I'll show you.<br> - Come on, Queenie. She may be sick.<br> - Not me. I got a date with Howard Porter.<br> Never mind Howard Porter. I need you.<br> Maybe Annie needs you too,<br> the way your old lady did.<br> - Now, just a minute.<br> - Move it.<br> No panhandlers on Broadway! Keep<br> your mind off that dizzy blonde of yours.<br> I don't think about her<br> during the daytime, boss.<br> Well, if it isn't my dear friend<br> Dave the Dude and his charming broad.<br> She's just bagged again. Annie,<br> you had me worried. Where's the bottle?<br> So nice of you to come.<br> The butler will take your things.<br> Lovely estate you have here,<br> Lady Chatterley.<br> It's nothing, really. Just something<br> I keep for the hunting season.<br> Everybody's coming down<br> for the hunting season, don't you know.<br> The flea hunt, isn't it?<br> What are you trying to do?<br> Knock yourself off?<br> Doc Michel told you<br> this paint'll poison you.<br> Dude, look.<br> The old lady's had her moments.<br> This on the emmis?<br> You really got yourself a kid?<br> Don't sit there slobbering.<br> Answer me. Is this your kid?<br> - No.<br> - Those crumbs, taking me for a sucker.<br> Oh!<br> - My baby!<br> - All right, Annie. Stand up. It's all right.<br> Dude knows all about it.<br> He's a godfather too.<br> I don't want you<br> casing the waterfront again.<br> I was born in a place like this and I don't<br> wanna come back. That's why I need you.<br> What's all this malarkey about a kid?<br> She's coming over with a count.<br> She's going to marry his son.<br> Royalty.<br> They're coming over to meet me.<br> Me.<br> Wait till they get a load of Apple Annie.<br> That'll be a laugh. Eh, Dude?<br> Wait till they meet<br> her crummy old lady. Eh, Queenie?<br> And see this dump.<br> Annie, you can't do this. Come on now,<br> you old souse. Get up out of there.<br> Take it easy. She's an old souse<br> maybe, but she's full of dreams.<br> - She's full of gin. Where are the apples?<br> - Here are your lousy apples.<br> Old fool, getting herself in a jam like this.<br> Now come on, let's go.<br> You're acting like Darcey already.<br> You can't leave her.<br> You want me to tuck her in bed?<br> Sing her a lullaby? Come on.<br> And her daughter? By the time<br> she gets here, she'll be in a psycho ward.<br> She'll sleep it off. She'll be all right in<br> the morning. I'll send Dr Michel. Come on.<br> What am I going to do, Queenie?<br> What am I going to do?<br> Poor creep. Some Dude must've<br> gotten in your blood once too.<br> Come on, Queenie!<br> I'm way past post time.<br> I got troubles, Annie, but boy, you...<br> you need a miracle.<br> What am I going to do?<br> What are you gonna do, Mr Dude?<br> - About what?<br> - About Miss Annie.<br> - What do you expect me to do?<br> - You could get her into the Marberry.<br> Apple Annie in the Marberry?<br> You're crazy.<br> - Just for a week.<br> - Now listen, Mr Dude.<br> We already took up a collection, we did.<br> We all chipped in 65 bucks to get her in.<br> You did? Well, 65 bucks is a tip<br> at the Marberry. You're all bats.<br> - What about your playboy friend?<br> - Rodney Kent.<br> - He's got a penthouse at the Marberry.<br> - You keep out of this. Move it, Junior.<br> Annie at the Marberry... I said move it!<br> His luck is gonna turn awful bad.<br> Apple, be lucky today.<br> All you little people in there,<br> you start workin' real hard.<br> All right. When you get home,<br> call Doc Michel to see Annie.<br> She'll be all right.<br> She's on a bender, that's all.<br> Hmm? Ain't it a fact?<br> You've seen her swacked before.<br> What the hell do I care?<br> I got what I want: The city of New York.<br> This great big town and those heels that<br> pushed me around, it's all mine now,<br> stretched right out on a silver platter.<br> Cos Darcey's come around to my way.<br> What do I need<br> that old apple souse for anyhow?<br> You know, they say luck is superstition.<br> Nah, it ain't superstition at all.<br> You know what it is?<br> Luck is an art. An art I got.<br> So I lose the old lady<br> and her apples. So what?<br> Apple Annie at the Marberry Hotel?<br> What do you expect me to do,<br> for cryin' out loud?<br> Look, will you say something?<br> Look, will you say something?<br> OK, Mr Big Shot.<br> Now keep your date with Darcey.<br> And no more gin, huh?<br> Hey, boss. These rich guys<br> use chequers with horses on 'em.<br> Put that down!<br> I oughta have my head shrunk,<br> doing this.<br> You at the Marberry! Why didn't you<br> swipe stationery from the White House?<br> You could've said<br> you were Eleanor Roosevelt.<br> - Whom did you wish to see, sir?<br> - Is this here Rodney Kent's igloo?<br> This is Mr Kent's penthouse, yes,<br> but unfortunately Mr Kent is in Havana.<br> He is? Well, where'd you get the idea<br> that I give a hang where he is?<br> - I just assumed...<br> - Come over here.<br> I'm gonna tell you something<br> that'll make you wet all over.<br> Really?<br> I don't care anything about Rodney Kent.<br> I'm lookin' for Dave the Dude.<br> - Who is that?<br> - He's here, ain't he?<br> Well... yes.<br> Well, what are you standin' there for,<br> growin' in the carpet? Take me to him.<br> Wait here, will you, please?<br> There is no carpet.<br> Sir? A gentleman. Rather primitive.<br> You tryin' to make me crazy?<br> What's goin' on?<br> Come here, come here.<br> - Where you been?<br> - Where have I been?<br> - I've had to do everything myself.<br> - I've been through a meat grinder.<br> For 24 hours I've been locked up<br> in Little Switz<br> listening to that seasick gorilla.<br> I'm alibiing like crazy.<br> - What are you alibiing for?<br> - For you, for not showing up.<br> So I didn't show up.<br> How'd you leave the big man, hm?<br> - Headfirst and landed in the gutter.<br> - Good.<br> Says he won't talk to messenger boys.<br> Says he barbecues them.<br> - Used the blowtorch, eh?<br> - Says next time I'll be inside the shirt.<br> Bluffing, Joy Boy. That's his psychology.<br> Pay no attention to him.<br> - What's this?<br> - Meet the new queen of society.<br> This is Annie, the Duchess of Apples.<br> What's your daughter doing in Spain?<br> Who's her father?<br> Aw, boss, that ain't a polite question<br> to ask a dame like Annie.<br> Wait a minute. You tellin' me Rodney Kent<br> gave you his apartment for this owl?<br> Yeah. He's a bigger sucker than I am.<br> He even threw in the butler.<br> Not against my will, sir. I love<br> Cinderella stories. Don't you, sir?<br> Take a walk, huh?<br> - Junior, what happened to Queenie?<br> - I don't know.<br> Dave, you gotta forget all this.<br> You gotta meet with Darcey.<br> That's the deal of a lifetime.<br> That's our living. What is all this?<br> I don't know.<br> And I don't want you to tell me.<br> But what are you? A boy scout?<br> Are you a tambourine shaker?<br> A million do-gooders are standin' in line<br> to help the hardly-ables like Apple Annie.<br> Stay in there and pitch, sister.<br> You see, you're Dave the Dude,<br> not Little Boy Blue.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Little Boy Blue? Come here.<br> - Ain't she always been lucky for me, huh?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> If I don't help her out of this jam,<br> how long d'you think my luck would last?<br> You wanna help her? Help her. But you<br> can't palm that crocodile off as society.<br> She couldn't fool<br> a pedigree cocker spaniel.<br> - We'd have to clean her up some.<br> - Some? Look at her.<br> A ragpicker wouldn't<br> stick his hook into her.<br> Well, here they are. The miracle workers.<br> Here's my maid, manicurist,<br> hairdresser, chiropodist, masseuse,<br> and the pice de rsistance, Pierre<br> of the Saxon Plaza. Pierre the divine.<br> - Take a bow, toots.<br> - Madame.<br> All right, gang. Here's your challenge.<br> Come on, Annie.<br> Stand up and meet your makers.<br> This has got to be a complete overhaul,<br> kids, from top to bottom.<br> - Don't forget a new set of kidneys.<br> - Let's go, Annie.<br> Come on, wizards. Let's wiz.<br> My old lady always said you can't make<br> a pig's ear out of an old sow.<br> Monsieur, your old lady was not Pierre.<br> Huh!<br> - Wait a minute. He can't go in there.<br> - Oh, that's all right.<br> Believe me, fellas, it's all right.<br> - Hey, boss, you payin' for all of this?<br> - Fun, eh?<br> Let's see if we can get it back from<br> the bookies. What's running at Hialeah?<br> - Here's the morning line-up.<br> - Thanks. Read 'em off to me.<br> People! Go figure them.<br> - Scratch 5, 7 and 12.<br> - Right.<br> It's important that these apples<br> are kept here all the time.<br> - What's your handle?<br> - Pardon?<br> - Your name.<br> - It's Hutchings, sir. Hutchings. With a g.<br> OK, Hutch. This oughta take care of the<br> help for a while. Split it up amongst them.<br> - They know to keep their mouths shut?<br> - And their ears.<br> - Told 'em what'd happen if they didn't?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Don't do that, please.<br> Oh, my feet.<br> I never wanna see shoes again.<br> Gentlemen, may I present<br> Mrs E Worthington Manville.<br> She's like a cockroach<br> what turned into a butterfly!<br> Dude,<br> I'll never forget this.<br> Never.<br> God bless you.<br> Well... You... You could've fooled anybody.<br> Well, you're gonna need a little<br> walking-around money, so...<br> here you go.<br> I guess everything's all set now, huh?<br> Good luck, Annie.<br> Joy Boy, Junior, come on.<br> - How do we contact Little Switz?<br> - They call your apartment every hour.<br> - We make the next call.<br> - Hey!<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - I did what you wanted, didn't I?<br> I postponed my wedding a week because<br> you asked me to make a lady out of her.<br> Don't think you can run off and leave me<br> holding the bag. No offence, Annie.<br> Look, woman, the Dude<br> has gotta make some bread.<br> If I can stall my wedding,<br> he can stall his short cut to Sing Sing.<br> For Pete's sakes, Queenie,<br> what else do you want?<br> I don't want anything. But what about<br> the husband she's supposed to have?<br> - Husband?<br> - That's a man who marries a woman.<br> - Whose husband?<br> - Annie's!<br> The Honourable E Worthington<br> Shmerthington! Who's gonna dig him up?<br> Dude?<br> Louise...<br> my daughter...<br> does expect a stepfather.<br> Well... go get her one.<br> - Can't you do anything yourself?<br> - Who's she gonna get?<br> - Shimkey, the blind man? Or Smiley?<br> - You find her one.<br> You're the one who needs her,<br> Mr Big, not me.<br> I got cafeterias. I don't need apples.<br> The Dude's whole future depends upon<br> this deal. Can you get off his back?<br> His whole future depends on Annie,<br> and don't you forget it, frog-face.<br> - You're a troublemaker.<br> - You're a selfish schtoonk!<br> All right, all right, all right!<br> I'll find her a... a husband.<br> This is beautiful. All right, Joy Boy, go<br> tell Darcey that the Dude ain't available<br> cos he's diggin' up a husband for some<br> old souse cos he's nuts about her apples.<br> Where am I gonna find a husband?<br> Where am I gonna find a husband?<br> In Macy's basement?<br> They don't sell 'em there, boss.<br> Yeah.<br> Me?<br> You.<br> I think he'd be just precious!<br> Oh, that would be a great idea.<br> There's only one problem.<br> I got a wife that's very fussy.<br> She don't like for me<br> to go around marryin' people!<br> Now, I know that might sound<br> very selfish to you,<br> but she's very funny that way.<br> I know his wife. He's right.<br> She's a selfish buffalo.<br> - Dude?<br> - What?<br> I got an idea.<br> What?<br> I know one real gentleman<br> I'm sure we can trust.<br> We? Oh, now we're all partners!<br> You know Judge Blake?<br> Judge Henry G Blake. That's our man.<br> When did you ever trust a judge?<br> For a proposition like this<br> we need a guy with class, with dignity,<br> a gentleman of the old school, and...<br> a thief.<br> Judge Blake, the guy that told you you<br> could shoot pool was yankin' your ankle.<br> Sucker's ready to bite.<br> Up in Providence, where I'm out of,<br> an amateur like you would lose his pants.<br> An excellent argument<br> for never visiting Providence.<br> I hate to do this to you, Judge,<br> but I got a reputation to keep up.<br> - And that does it.<br> - Astonishing!<br> Willie Hoppe couldn't do better.<br> You pool-hall poltroons.<br> Once again you lured me into a game with<br> a master, solely for your own amusement.<br> - You're just warmin' up. Another game?<br> - I came here to slay a sombre afternoon,<br> not to be made sport of<br> by Pecksniffian oafs.<br> Aw, go on, Judge. It's only a nickel a ball.<br> What do you say<br> we double the bet one time?<br> Ten cents a ball?<br> Why, that's a veritable fortune.<br> - Afraid, huh, Judge?<br> - Afraid?<br> - I'll make it 50 cents a ball.<br> - OK. You got yourself a deal.<br> Attendant, rack 'em up.<br> Hey, Judge.<br> If you will excuse me, while you break,<br> I'll have a word with an associate justice.<br> Greetings, my intellectual giant. What<br> brings you down to Kew in lilac-time?<br> The Dude wants to see you.<br> Your master's timing<br> is most regrettable, my dear Junior.<br> - I have a plump pigeon in my sights.<br> - Huh?<br> Within the hour Providence is going to<br> provide next month's room rent.<br> - Come on, Your Honour. It's your shot.<br> - By your leave, sir. My pigeon is cooing.<br> A little shaky, huh, Judge?<br> My boy, the impatient blade<br> is about to descend...<br> on your red hick's neck.<br> Oho!<br> Oho!<br> That was the bedroom.<br> Over here, that's the billiard room.<br> Down here's the guest rooms.<br> - Pretty classy layout, huh, Judge?<br> - Lovely, lovely.<br> The beauty of the Taj Mahal,<br> the serenity of Melrose Abbey.<br> Sir, "If thou wouldst view<br> fair Melrose aright..."<br> "Go visit it by the pale moonlight."<br> "For the gay beams of lightsome day<br> Gild, but to flout, the ruins grey."<br> - Oh, my!<br> - To Scott.<br> - He'll do.<br> - Yeah.<br> Judge, think you could force yourself<br> to shack up here for a week?<br> - Is he for real?<br> - He comes with the coop.<br> If this is a deal, you get yourself<br> a new set of rags and 100 clams.<br> What do you expect from me for all this<br> opulence? I'm a poor hand at violence.<br> You're a lock for this gag.<br> All you gotta do is be a husband.<br> A husband? Impossible.<br> I'm twice a widower now,<br> thanks to my fleetness of foot<br> and the grace of distance.<br> No, you don't have to marry the dame.<br> Just be a husband for one week.<br> Queenie! Come here a minute, will you?<br> Judge, you've heard of<br> Queenie Martin, haven't you?<br> My cup runneth over.<br> Queenie, meet the judge.<br> I told you I'd find you a good husband.<br> Madam, this is a great honour,<br> a rare experience,<br> and a pulsating pleasure.<br> Oh, Your Honour.<br> Yeah. With a new set of clothes<br> he'll just make it fine.<br> Thank you. I'll do my best. But at my age<br> the libido is most unpredictable.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - Your humble servant, madam.<br> And your eager spouse.<br> - That's the best offer I've had all day.<br> - No wonder he's drooling.<br> Listen, you fricasseed Casanova. Not her.<br> You're gonna marry Apple Annie.<br> - Apple Annie?<br> - Apple Annie.<br> Even as a jest, Dude, that's an insult.<br> Junior!<br> Apple Annie. Preposterous!<br> A creature of the pavements, a... a...<br> a frowsy hag, with the breath of a dragon.<br> Sir, despite my larcenous impulses,<br> I am a gentleman.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Good afternoon, Annie.<br> Annie?<br> That's Annie.<br> Apple Annie?<br> Annie, the judge was just saying<br> how pleased he'll be to be your husband.<br> Thank you, Judge.<br> I'm deeply grateful.<br> The pleasure, I assure you,<br> dear kind and charming lady,<br> is entirely mine.<br> You're all set now, Annie. You got yourself<br> a husband. Now you'll go to the boat.<br> Yeah. God bless you, Dude.<br> God bless you.<br> OK.<br> Joy Boy, let's go.<br> Sure you don't wanna kill a couple<br> of hours, take some family pictures?<br> Sir?<br> Sir!<br> Sir, pardon me.<br> I will see that everything is done, sir,<br> notwithstanding my cardiac.<br> - What?<br> - Oh, you can trust me, sir.<br> I've had commando training.<br> The Boer War, you know.<br> I shall need at least a score<br> of your henchmen, very rugged ones.<br> - A hollow square will hold them.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> The ship's reporters.<br> They interview the arriving celebrities.<br> They will want to know from the count<br> why he came to America.<br> Holy Toledo. I forgot about the reporters.<br> - Why didn't you think of that?<br> - Why didn't I think of it?<br> Come on, Junior. We gotta round up<br> the boys. What time does the ship get in?<br> I hope it sinks.<br> Take a walk.<br> Has she seen the kid yet?<br> - She's still looking.<br> - She's still looking.<br> - How do I look?<br> - Beautiful. Like a star.<br> I can hardly believe it. In a few minutes<br> I'll have my baby in my arms.<br> - Do you see her yet?<br> - No, not yet.<br> Dude, stay close to me. I'm so frightened.<br> At least the boat's on time.<br> - What about reporters?<br> - I took care of 'em.<br> The Dude has woven a chain<br> of missing links around us.<br> Hey, look. There's Dave the Dude.<br> Yeah, with his whole mob.<br> Let's stick around. I've been waiting<br> ten years to pin something on that Dude.<br> There she is! There she is! Louise!<br> Louise! Louise, darling!<br> Louise! Louise!<br> Louise!<br> Louise!<br> Louise! Louise!<br> She saw me. She recognised me.<br> Louise!<br> Mama! Mama!<br> Mama!<br> My baby. My baby.<br> My Louise.<br> I can't believe it, after all these years.<br> Why, you're a grown woman.<br> - And so beautiful.<br> - Oh, Mama, you are too.<br> I would've known you anywhere.<br> What are they doin' now, Sal?<br> Huggin' and kissin'.<br> Is she happy?<br> - She's crying.<br> - She's crying.<br> I want you to meet Count Alfonso Romero<br> and his son Carlos Romero.<br> This is my mother.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Madam.<br> How do you do?<br> Darling, this is your stepfather,<br> Judge Manville.<br> Mother's written me<br> so much about you, Father.<br> I want you to meet Count Romero<br> and his son Carlos.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Welcome to America, my dear Count.<br> We've looked forward to your visit<br> with considerable relish.<br> This is a glorious moment for everyone.<br> Oh, how stupid of me.<br> - Louise, this is your, um...<br> - Aunt. Aunt Betty.<br> - Aunt Betty.<br> - And Uncle David.<br> - I never knew I had an aunt and uncle.<br> - Yes, dear. David is your father's brother.<br> I'm so pleased.<br> Mother never wrote a word about you.<br> That's because he's always been<br> the black sheep of the family.<br> May I present Count Romero,<br> and Carlos Romero.<br> This is my Aunt Betty and my Uncle David.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Nice to meet you. Will you excuse me?<br> Excuse me. I'm the ship news reporter.<br> You lookin' for somebody, kid? What is it?<br> - You talking to me?<br> - No, your Aunt Tillie.<br> - They made me the ship news reporter.<br> - No kiddin'?<br> - I gotta check the passengers.<br> - There's no passengers on that boat.<br> - What do you call those people?<br> - Spanish sailors. They all dress like that.<br> - Hey, what kind of a gag is this?<br> - This is no gag. You gotta go to pier four.<br> - The Jersey ferry just hit an iceberg.<br> - Then it got shot up by a submarine.<br> - One of ours.<br> - A catastrophe.<br> - Terrible thing.<br> - Worse than the Lusitania.<br> Take this man to pier four in the Bronx.<br> - Pier four ain't in the Bronx.<br> - It's in the Bronx. It moved.<br> - How many is that?<br> - That's five, and we're runnin' out of cars.<br> You wait here<br> while I get Count Romero.<br> You will come with me.<br> Take a walk.<br> I want you to take some<br> very good pictures of the count.<br> - Can I help you, mister?<br> - I doubt it, sir.<br> - I am the Spanish consul and...<br> - I was just looking for you.<br> - You were?<br> - Yes. Immigration.<br> We're holding Count Romero<br> because of some rare Spanish disease.<br> Rare disease? But there is<br> no such thing as a Spanish disease.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> - Yes, Sergeant?<br> It's worse than expected. They say they'll<br> take the count away in a straitjacket.<br> I'm sure the consul here<br> can straighten things out.<br> - Take the consul to the count's cabin.<br> - Aye aye, sir.<br> - This way.<br> - Don't get too close to the count.<br> This is fantastic! I am going to take this<br> to the secretary of state himself.<br> You should, sir.<br> Looks like the Dude's<br> got a new swindle going.<br> The Dude's too smart to pull anything<br> in the open. Let's go.<br> Wait a minute. Let's have<br> a little chat with him anyway.<br> OK.<br> Gangway. Gangway. Gangway.<br> Mr Dude, sir, a couple of coppers<br> are comin' to put the arm on you.<br> Holy cow.<br> Junior, start a brannigan.<br> Sock the Weasel.<br> - Sock the Weasel? He's my brother!<br> - Don't argue. Sock the Weasel.<br> - Hey, Weasel. How's Ma?<br> - Ma's OK. She's all right.<br> Good.<br> Ma told you not to hit me no more!<br> Fight!<br> - Amscray. A couple of ullbays.<br> - Folks, I think we'd best be on our way.<br> Hi, fellas.<br> Boy, have I seen New York<br> in the past four days!<br> Boss, Queenie says for you<br> to eat these sandwiches.<br> - How's tricks with the social mob?<br> - It's going so great, I'm scared.<br> First thing, breakfast on gold plates.<br> Then Queenie herds us into the car<br> and we go sightseeing all over.<br> Did you know New York was an island?<br> - What do you want, boss?<br> - Got a pastrami?<br> Yeah. Ma thought I was nuts.<br> Hey, Joy Boy. We passed by a zoo,<br> and what do you think I saw? A cow!<br> Here's your yoghurt.<br> - Guess who's buried in Grant's Tomb.<br> - Will you leave me alone with the tomb?<br> You're sure the count<br> ain't talked to nobody?<br> Count Romero? He don't get<br> a chance to talk to himself.<br> When the judge runs out of gas about<br> cowboys and Indians, Queenie sings.<br> - Enough already! Please!<br> - You ain't heard nothin' yet.<br> You should see the way Annie looks at<br> her daughter - like she was a banana split.<br> Hey, boss, those two kids better<br> get married, or else they're gonna bust.<br> See? I told you guys.<br> Helping that old doll...<br> it kinda gets me, right here.<br> You know what I mean?<br> You know, boss, it gets me too.<br> Only higher.<br> I hate to tell you where it gets me.<br> And I'm gonna tell you.<br> You're playin' with your darts,<br> and you're happy with the banana,<br> but me, I'm scared.<br> Three days and nights we're waitin'<br> by the phone. Darcey ain't called.<br> You know what that means?<br> I can feel the bullets.<br> Darcey's gotta knock us off now,<br> or we're done.<br> All right. I don't complain. No.<br> You say no bullets. All right.<br> You say no guns. All right.<br> No bodyguards. All right.<br> You say don't lock the doors. All right.<br> It's crazy, but I've been with you<br> for ten years. I'll go along for the ride.<br> But not this. I'm not gonna sit here,<br> sweat, feel hot lead, and at the same time<br> listen to that sugar-coated malarkey about<br> the beggar woman and her daughter.<br> That's all! Finished! Done! Goodbye!<br> That's Darcey.<br> I wish I could worry like him,<br> but I don't know how.<br> Talk.<br> Aw, for cryin' out loud.<br> It's Annie's butler.<br> That's the bum from the Boer War.<br> Now what?<br> Yeah?<br> I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr Dude,<br> but the count just asked me<br> to telephone the Spanish consul.<br> - What does he want to talk to him for?<br> - I don't know why.<br> But I did hear him say<br> that he was tired of sightseeing<br> and he wanted to meet some people.<br> - Joy Boy, how's your Spanish?<br> - As good as my French. They both stink.<br> Junior, did you learn anything<br> from Spanish Lena?<br> Spanish Lena was a Hungarian.<br> Don't nobody know nothin'?<br> And where's Queenie?<br> Put the sucker on. I'll fade him myself.<br> It's open.<br> Hey, you're Darcey's boys.<br> Mr Darcey don't never send "boys".<br> - Mr Darcey wants to see you.<br> - We were waiting for his call.<br> Why don't you make yourself at home?<br> And you were worried!<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Soy el conde de Romero.<br> Por qu no fue a recibirme?<br> Very sorry.<br> Nobody home. They all go far away.<br> They all go... California.<br> Lots of sunshine in California.<br> So this Japanese houseboy.<br> So sorry. Ooh, very sorry.<br> No, I'm very sorry, they're not home.<br> Ooh, very sorry. No, I'm very sorry.<br> They're not home. Nobody home. Just me.<br> OK. Bye-bye.<br> That's very good, Mr Moto.<br> Now let's go do some business.<br> I'll be with you in a minute.<br> Where is Little Switz?<br> - We'll take you personal.<br> - Yeah.<br> But first I have a little personal business.<br> I wanna stop off and buy my apple.<br> You ain't stoppin' nowhere.<br> Mr Darcey's through playin'. Up!<br> You, fancy-pants, over there.<br> You, Mr Apples, over here. Turn around.<br> - Turn around! Up! Up!<br> - All right, all right.<br> - Hey, your hand's bleeding.<br> - Oh! Argh!<br> - This way, gentlemen.<br> - We'll tie 'em, lock 'em in the bathroom.<br> When he gets his apple, we'll be back<br> to pick you up. Now get in there! Move!<br> Wait. Lock 'em in the closet, Joy Boy.<br> They may just wax the bathroom floor.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - I am Seor Cortez, the Spanish consul.<br> - The Spanish consul?<br> - Yes.<br> - Is Count Romero to be found here?<br> - Well... I don't believe he's in just now.<br> - So if you'd care to leave your card...<br> - Seor Cortez?<br> Seor conde.<br> Count Romero will receive you.<br> It has been very difficult<br> for me to locate you, Count Romero.<br> This is most confusing.<br> I just had your office on the phone,<br> and your Japanese houseboy<br> assured me you were out of town.<br> - Japanese?<br> - S.<br> What would I be doing<br> with a Japanese houseboy?<br> - That is what we were wondering.<br> - Very strange.<br> - May I?<br> - S, s.<br> It is my impression that there's<br> something peculiar about Mrs Manville.<br> - Mrs Manville? Peculiar?<br> - Yes.<br> I've telephoned several society editors<br> and they know nothing about her.<br> - I would be very cautious if I were you.<br> - Of what?<br> - Father, I resent these insinuations.<br> - You did not even meet me at the pier.<br> Believe me, I was there.<br> But an official told me<br> you were having difficulty with your shots.<br> Shots? What shots?<br> A gentleman from the immigration<br> service said you could not land<br> because you had contracted<br> a peculiar disease.<br> And later, the ship's captain told me<br> you were a guest of this Mrs Manville.<br> Seor, I had no trouble landing.<br> I am in perfect health.<br> You are a most confused man.<br> When I try to reach you on the phone I find<br> your confusion has spread to your staff,<br> where a Japanese listens to Spanish<br> and answers in pidgin English. Caramba!<br> Seor, give the gentleman his hat.<br> Very well, Count Romero. But in taking<br> my leave, let me add only this.<br> That a bellboy in this very hotel<br> assured me that this penthouse<br> is permanently leased by an American<br> novelist named Rodney Kent.<br> Is this the way our diplomats conduct<br> our affairs? Questioning bellboys?<br> Good day, sir. This episode<br> will raise some eyebrows in Madrid.<br> - Rodney Kent!<br> - It's ridiculous.<br> For years Louise has corresponded<br> with her mother at this very hotel.<br> - If I may, sir?<br> - S, s.<br> Thank you.<br> - Rodney Kent does live here.<br> - What?<br> In these books, sir. See?<br> Pulitzer Prize winner.<br> The judge - Judge Manville -<br> writes under that name.<br> Ah. Ah!<br> - After the fashion of Mr Mark Twain.<br> - And O Henry, Father.<br> O Henry. S, seor. Yes.<br> - I trust this confidence will be respected.<br> - Of course.<br> Thank you.<br> Tea is served, sir, on the terrace.<br> Now, what are we gonna do after tea?<br> - What does the count like to do most?<br> - Well, he rides a bicycle a great deal.<br> Six- day bicycle races.<br> Great. I'll call for tickets.<br> Oh, dear Count, I have<br> such a surprise for you.<br> We just decided to go to the six- day<br> bicycle races at Madison Square Garden.<br> - But we'll not be here for six more days.<br> - Hi, everybody. Just came to say hello.<br> And... buy one of your delicious apples.<br> Oh, here we are. You see, Count,<br> it's sort of a family joke.<br> I always feel that<br> these apples bring me luck.<br> What a charming idea.<br> I have the same feeling about onions.<br> - What is it, Hutchings?<br> - A journalist to see you, sir. Second call.<br> That guy out there is a reporter.<br> What provoked the curiosity<br> in this wretched scribe?<br> - He requests a biography of Mrs Manville.<br> - Absurd.<br> Brother David, perhaps you<br> can handle this inquisitor?<br> Don't worry about a thing, Judge.<br> Everything's taken care of.<br> - What's the pitch, Brisbane?<br> - From the society desk at the Star.<br> I wanna do a feature<br> on Mrs E Worthington Manville.<br> - She's not in the Social Register.<br> - Not in the Social Register?<br> Or the phone book,<br> not even the Yellow Pages.<br> Did you look under M's?<br> Look, I'm tired.<br> The Spanish consul called my editor...<br> - Say, aren't you Dave the Dude?<br> - What is he talking about?<br> Sure. I seen you around<br> Queenie Martin's club.<br> You know, you're wasting your time<br> with society news.<br> You could be a great big reporter,<br> and we could give you a great big story.<br> Yeah, but we better go someplace<br> where we won't be disturbed.<br> - Isn't that right, Uncle David?<br> - That's right.<br> - Do you want to step this way?<br> - Right this way.<br> No more sightseeing. No more buildings.<br> Mrs Manville, I have come<br> to know your daughter that well<br> that I love her like a father.<br> Thanks... Thank you.<br> And so I wish to announce<br> I will be greatly honoured<br> if your daughter will accept<br> the proposal of my son in marriage.<br> Congratulations, Carlos! This is<br> a great moment, a historic moment.<br> The union of our two families.<br> The Montagues and the Capulets.<br> My dear Count,<br> this calls for a real celebration.<br> That is exactly what I was coming to.<br> It will give me the greatest pleasure<br> to announce the engagement officially<br> at a reception for a few<br> of your intimate friends.<br> Reception?<br> - With people?<br> - S.<br> - Father...<br> - No, no.<br> Relax and enjoy yourself, newsboy.<br> You're living at the Marberry.<br> It was nice meetin' you.<br> Watch your diction, watch your diction.<br> Reporter's taken care of, Judge.<br> Uncle David, congratulate us.<br> Carlos and I are engaged.<br> You're a lucky man, Carlos.<br> Congratulations.<br> Brother David, I just told the count we'd<br> make the announcement at the reception.<br> Fine. Well, I'll see you folks around.<br> Reception? What reception?<br> The count wants to meet<br> some of our friends.<br> A modest affair. Nothing elaborate.<br> Just the intimate friends<br> of the parents of the bride.<br> About... 100 people, did you say, Judge?<br> 100... friends?<br> You're the only one<br> who can handle it, David.<br> - We must tell Aunt Betty at once.<br> - Aunt Betty will be the first to know.<br> Brother Henry, would you come with me?<br> I think we have to make up a list.<br> Mrs Manville, I hope there is<br> enough time for the preparations.<br> Why, you two-bit pool hustler.<br> Sit down there. Sit down!<br> - I told you not to get used to high living.<br> - It was the count's idea!<br> - I oughta belt him.<br> - Now, now, godfather.<br> Do you know what this windbag's<br> got us into? A reception for 100 people.<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - I'm fleeing from Armageddon, sir.<br> With my cardiac condition<br> I just cannot take unhappy endings.<br> - So I'm off to join Mr Kent in Havana.<br> - With two broken legs?<br> My legs, sir? Oh, they're quite...<br> Oh. Oh!<br> Very cleverly put, sir.<br> Thank you, sir. Yes. Not at all.<br> You!<br> - You'll break the poor lady's heart.<br> - Why didn't you stop it before it started?<br> - Oh, there you are.<br> - So we gotta throw a party.<br> So we just herd up<br> a bunch of freeloaders.<br> Society freeloaders. The count<br> expects 100 of the Four Hundred.<br> Annie only knows people from sewers.<br> Which reminds me. You got a couple of<br> sewer rats trussed up in the closet.<br> Darcey's mugs. I forgot all about them.<br> The Weasel's in Annie's place,<br> so I'm here.<br> Somebody tell me how I got into this pot.<br> I didn't wanna be dealt in in the first place.<br> You, Queenie. You were the one<br> who suckered me into this.<br> As long as I was minding my own<br> business in my own racket, it was fine.<br> But then I had to start to help somebody,<br> had to be the big man.<br> And will you look at me now?<br> I got oost into this old dame's life,<br> I got a couple of hoods, a couple of<br> hatchet men, stashed in that closet,<br> - a reporter guzzled up in the penthouse...<br> - You got three reporters in the penthouse.<br> - Three?<br> - Two more showed up so we bagged 'em.<br> That's kidnapping. Do you know<br> what the newspapers'll do to us?<br> Does it still kinda get you<br> a little bit, right here?<br> - The butler says there's enough food.<br> - That's it. I've had it.<br> You, Junior, bring those<br> Darcey orang-utans to me right now.<br> I like that butler. Calls me "sir",<br> bows to me. Makes me feel like a broad.<br> You take care of those reporters<br> till I square the beef with 'em.<br> And you go tell your friend Annie<br> to take her business around the corner,<br> because I am through, I am finished!<br> Oh, boy. And just when you were<br> starting to act like a human.<br> Queenie, you got 30 seconds<br> before I pick you up and throw you out.<br> You know, some people<br> toss charity balls for homeless cats.<br> They even build zoos<br> so wild animals live good.<br> - You get arrested if you whip a horse.<br> - 10.<br> Good people help, Dude. What are we?<br> Did we ever build a bridge<br> or plant a seed?<br> - 20.<br> - We're nothin'.<br> We're all a bunch of grabbers,<br> looking for the best of it.<br> - Just once, couldn't we help somebody?<br> - That's it. You're through, sister.<br> Yes, we're gonna help somebody.<br> We are going to help me.<br> I'm gonna make any kind of a deal Darcey<br> wants. Unless we've blown it already.<br> Hallelujah! I'm gonna drink to you.<br> It's my first in five years.<br> Do I infer you're stranding Annie<br> on the rocky beach of despair?<br> I've had just about enough<br> of your hot air too, Judge. You - out!<br> And you - out. Both of you - out.<br> That's it. School's out. Everybody out.<br> I hope we're not interrupting anything.<br> Louise! Darling!<br> Uncle David just told me the good news.<br> - My heartiest congratulations, Carlos.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I hope we're not intruding.<br> - Not at all. You're a breath of spring.<br> We were just taking a walk and Carlos had<br> the most wonderful, sweetest idea.<br> - What is it, Carlos?<br> - No, no. This is not the time. Or the place.<br> Of course it is, Carlos.<br> He thinks the world of you, Uncle David.<br> - Louise.<br> - What is it, Carlos?<br> Well, sir, I... that is, Louise and I...<br> Yes.<br> ...we would be most pleased if,<br> when the time comes,<br> you will consent to be godfather<br> to our first child.<br> He'd be delighted.<br> Uncle David's already<br> an experienced godfather.<br> Oh, Uncle David! I love you so much.<br> Thank you, seor. I am very honoured,<br> and my family is very honoured.<br> - And if it's a boy we'll name him after you.<br> - No.<br> Louise, we cannot take up<br> any more of their time.<br> No. I'm sure you have so much to do,<br> arranging the reception on short notice.<br> Goodbye.<br> - About 100 people, you said, Judge?<br> - Not just people.<br> But citizens of style and grace.<br> And this above all: Daisies who won't tell.<br> Dude's gang!<br> Now, there's a bunch of daisies<br> that wouldn't dare squeal.<br> With the right clothes<br> they'd pass off as kings.<br> - They would?<br> - Well, look at Annie.<br> The count fell for her. And you and me.<br> And Carlos thinks the Dude<br> is a young Abe Lincoln.<br> And the count even swallowed Joy Boy,<br> and I can do better than that in a pet shop.<br> If you weren't a broad<br> I'd kick you right in the stomach.<br> And my old chorus girls.<br> Why, they'd make the most glamorous<br> society queens this town's ever seen!<br> Indeed. Why not?<br> The world goes round in make-believe.<br> Louie the Lug - with a carnation in his<br> buttonhole, he'll look like Grover Whalen.<br> The Weasel'd make<br> a great secretary of war.<br> The Weasel as secretary of war? No,<br> he don't rate no more than an alderman.<br> Dude!<br> Why, the Weasel'd make as good a<br> secretary of war as anyone you can name.<br> No, I think he'd rate an alderman.<br> Dude, you're gettin' hooked again.<br> You know what? You almost had me<br> walking out on poor old Apple Annie.<br> Queenie, call your broads. Judge, call<br> Boyle's pool room. You know the number.<br> - I'll call...<br> - Dude... Dude!<br> Round everybody up.<br> They was knotted real tight.<br> Good thing I was a boy scout.<br> Mr Darcey ain't gonna like this.<br> You tell Mr Darcey he's got a deal, but on<br> my terms. He delivers me $100,000 cash.<br> And no more of you popgun monkeys<br> showing up or else I ain't gonna like it.<br> Would you kindly connect me<br> with Harry the Horse?<br> Honey, forget the house party.<br> I need you now.<br> Cheesecake, roust out the boys<br> and take 'em to a Turkish bath, will you?<br> What do you think, what for?<br> A bath, you jerk!<br> Hey, Joy Boy, get ahold of whatshisname.<br> Rosy, the suit man.<br> That's a good idea. I'll have him<br> measure you all for straitjackets.<br> I gave my love a cherry<br> without no stone<br> I gave my love a chicken<br> without no bone<br> I gave my love a ring that had no end<br> I gave my love a baby<br> With no crying<br> I threw Carlos a flower<br> And blushed a smile<br> My love threw me the autumn moon<br> And laughed a mile<br> I gave my love a heart of love<br> Wrapped up in pink and blue<br> I'll give my love a baby<br> Who'll look like you<br> - Keep singing. Please.<br> - No, Carlos. It's your turn.<br> - I'm busy.<br> - The wedding poem. You promised.<br> - Keep still.<br> - You'll have to at the wedding feast.<br> Your father told me that every Romero<br> for 1,000 years has had to do it.<br> - All because some silly ancestor wrote it.<br> - I love it. Please?<br> You interrupt people<br> at the oddest moments.<br> Please?<br> I hope nobody is listening.<br> For her, for whom<br> I would walk through fire,<br> the great cathedral's heavenly choir<br> sings God's angelic music.<br> Be still, my racing heart -<br> she is floating toward me<br> as a winged melody.<br> I burst with a Spanish pride.<br> A thousand eyes, all moist and dewy,<br> share the lovely vision.<br> Behold: My bride.<br> - Mother!<br> - Mrs Manville.<br> - I was lonely for you.<br> - It is my fault. Please.<br> I have a lifetime with Louise, and you<br> only two days. I will see you later, Mother.<br> You do not mind<br> my calling you "Mother"?<br> I'd like that... Son.<br> Thank you...<br> Mother.<br> You do love him, don't you?<br> So much it must show, Mama.<br> Today, when we were<br> walking along Broadway,<br> a little old flower pedlar -<br> a deaf and dumb lady - gave me this.<br> She insisted I take it,<br> and she refused to accept a penny for it.<br> - Oh, Mama, life is wonderful, isn't it?<br> - Yes, baby. Yes.<br> - Mama?<br> - Yes?<br> You don't think anything can...<br> can happen, do you?<br> - Happen?<br> - I'm foolish, I suppose.<br> Maybe it's because I'm wishing so hard.<br> Mama, have you ever wished<br> for something so hard...<br> Nothing's going to happen.<br> Nothing.<br> Yeah?<br> - Captain Moore to see you, Inspector.<br> - Send him right in.<br> - Anything on the missing reporters?<br> - Nothing, Inspector. Not a thing.<br> The newspapers are crucifying us.<br> You hear Winchell last night?<br> - Yeah?<br> - The commissioner's on the phone.<br> There he is again. Fourth time today.<br> Hello, Commissioner.<br> No, but I've got Captain Moore<br> in my office right now.<br> - No, not a thing yet.<br> - What do you mean?<br> I'm not gonna be made the goat<br> for the whole department.<br> - What is it?<br> - The mayor's on the phone.<br> - Didn't you tell him I was out?<br> - He didn't believe it.<br> Hold on a minute.<br> Hello. Yeah, Chief. I was just talking<br> to Inspector McCrary. Not a thing yet.<br> I have had a supersufficiency of<br> "not a thing".<br> I want some action, and I want it quickly.<br> Every editor in town is in my office now.<br> And you'll get a front-page editorial in<br> my paper every day till something's done.<br> It is a very embarrassing situation<br> when a reporter is not safe on our streets.<br> If the city can't do anything,<br> perhaps the state can.<br> We'll take it up<br> with the governor tomorrow.<br> I want you to find<br> those three reporters, Commissioner,<br> or I will be forced<br> to demand your resignation.<br> McCrary, you dig up those three reporters<br> or I'll have to get myself another boy.<br> Captain, you have 24 hours<br> to find those reporters.<br> If you can't, you'll find yourself on the<br> other end of a broom at the horse barn!<br> - What is it?<br> - I think we got an angle on the reporters.<br> - Speak up, son.<br> - A funny thing happened.<br> Last Saturday I met one of the boats,<br> to check the passenger list.<br> - Two characters shoved me into a car.<br> - Why didn't you report it sooner?<br> They didn't hurt me, just drove me around<br> the Bronx, then gave me taxi money.<br> - Any idea who grabbed him?<br> - Not exactly.<br> Two of our men saw Dave the Dude at the<br> pier Saturday night meeting some people.<br> - And with his whole mob.<br> - Dave the Dude, hm?<br> It's not much, but we're beginning<br> to look like a police department.<br> Captain, you better put a tail on the Dude.<br> There could be a connection.<br> These are great, Judge.<br> Just a few more speeches.<br> As Jimmy Durante says,<br> "I've got a million of 'em."<br> "My dear Count, it is indeed a pleasure..."<br> I'm charmed to meet you, Count.<br> I'm charmed to meet you...<br> - All right, hold it, everybody!<br> - Quiet! Quiet!<br> Listen. Queenie, take your broads<br> to the other side of the room.<br> - You guys, I want to talk to you.<br> - Guys over here! Broads over there!<br> Come on, move it! We ain't got all night.<br> You guys,<br> you gotta remember something.<br> You're not a bunch of bums.<br> You're a bunch of gents.<br> Dude, you gotta make 'em stop with the<br> pistols. They making holes in the lining.<br> I thought I told you to tell 'em<br> to leave the rods home.<br> - Weasel, I told you - no rods!<br> - No rods. Come on, you guys.<br> If we don't act like gents, we'll bollix<br> the whole schmear up tomorrow night.<br> Now, you all got the speeches<br> the judge wrote for you.<br> You know who you are, huh?<br> I don't have to tell you?<br> - Who are you, Slops?<br> - Governor of the State of Utta.<br> - State of what? No, no. State of Utah.<br> - Utah, metah...<br> Look, will you read the speech<br> the way the judge gave it to you, please?<br> Don't yak too much. Smile all the time.<br> That'll get you by anybody, even kings.<br> Kings, yeah. But these mugs? You smile<br> at 'em, you get a hand on the knee.<br> You've had so many hands on your knees,<br> deary, you wear gloves for stockings.<br> OK, settle down.<br> Dude! If any of your he's<br> make passes at my she's...<br> - No passes, no passes, no passes!<br> - You hear that? No passes.<br> - No passes? Gee, what a party pooper.<br> - I don't wanna hear no more from you.<br> Dude, this ain't a good speech<br> the judge gave me.<br> - You handicapping speeches now?<br> - This count's from out of town.<br> - So what?<br> - I tell him he's lucky to meet Apple Annie.<br> You wanna tell him you'll fix him up with<br> a couple of dames? Just read the speech!<br> Cheesecake!<br> Tell 'em to be quiet. Quiet down, guys.<br> Will you please be quiet!<br> Why aren't you practising?<br> - I've been practising. Only...<br> - Only what?<br> I'm as good as Louie the Lug is, and<br> if he's ambassador, I oughta be a king.<br> Secretary of the interior<br> is bigger than an ambassador.<br> I ain't as dumb as you think.<br> A secretary's a secretary.<br> All right, all right, brain.<br> I'll make you the postmaster. All right?<br> That's more like it. I save stamps.<br> - Yeah. Judge, you got a new postmaster.<br> - Check.<br> Come here, Mex.<br> Give the speech to him now.<br> - You're the count.<br> - I thought I was the governor of Florida.<br> Will you just please pretend<br> you're the count for a minute?<br> Go ahead. Shoot.<br> Count, Your Honour...<br> it's a rare... privy...<br> - privy...<br> - What are you talking about?<br> "It's a rare privilege", jackass!<br> Does it say that? I didn't think I was<br> supposed to call the count no jackass.<br> - You're giving me a headache, you guys.<br> - Me too!<br> What a bunch of ignoramice. Ignoramice -<br> that's more than one ignoramouse.<br> Yeah? You too, huh? Here.<br> - I'm losing my voice.<br> - Start practisin'!<br> - I am charmed to meet you, Count.<br> - You stink.<br> Jerk.<br> No, you don't. All we need now<br> is a crying drunk.<br> Give me one good reason to stay sober.<br> You thought all this up.<br> You straighten out this menagerie.<br> - Hey, guys, listen to Miss Martin here!<br> - Quiet down, everybody.<br> - Quiet!<br> - Quiet.<br> - Quiet!<br> - Quiet!<br> Let's do one thing at a time.<br> Forget the speeches for now<br> and we'll concentrate on the bowing.<br> - Judge, show 'em how to bow again.<br> - It's quite simple.<br> The movement is at the waist,<br> with a graceful gesture of the hand - thus.<br> What's so difficult about that?<br> Head waiters do it. Foreigners do it -<br> can't even speak English.<br> All right, listen. Have a he and a she,<br> pair off and practise the bowing.<br> - All you broads over here!<br> - Come on, girls.<br> Pick out a guy and start bowing.<br> Don't forget the gesture with the hand.<br> Bow. Everybody bow. Bow!<br> If I'm sober, why do I see things like this?<br> Does the board of health<br> know about this epidemic?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Him.<br> He tried to pick my pocket<br> where there ain't no pocket.<br> All right, hold it! You guys ain't taking this<br> thing serious. And you gals ain't either.<br> But this is serious, all right.<br> It's murder.<br> You're probably saying "What's in it<br> for us?" I'll tell you: Nothin'.<br> I mean, nothin' that<br> you can put in your pocket.<br> After all, did any of us ever plant a bridge?<br> Uh... build a bridge or plant a seed?<br> For once, could we just<br> do somethin' nice for somebody?<br> This is for old Apple Annie.<br> If something goes wrong tomorrow night,<br> there's no telling what'll happen to Annie.<br> Maybe she'll put her head in the oven -<br> the perfect solution.<br> So come on now. We're gonna practise.<br> We're gonna get in there... Tell you what.<br> Make believe it's for your own mother.<br> I oughta do somethin' for my mother.<br> They won't let me see her in solitary.<br> Now start practising, everybody.<br> I say it again and again and again.<br> This will never work, this will never work,<br> this will never work.<br> Happy days.<br> The music must be soft and mellow.<br> Nothing harsh, nothing raucous.<br> Just the gentle drip of rain<br> upon an autumn leaf.<br> - Yes, sir. I'll lay on the silk.<br> - Splendid. Keep it schmaltzy.<br> - The new men?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Trustworthy?<br> - Completely.<br> - I'm just loving this, sir. Aren't you?<br> - Hutch, in here it's Christmas.<br> Quite.<br> Jingle bells, jingle bells<br> Jingle all the way...<br> Yes.<br> As Pascal said: The heart hath reasons<br> that reason itself knows nothing about.<br> A handkerchief.<br> - A handkerchief.<br> - It's in your hand, ma'am.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Lola, do I look all right?<br> The head waiter at the Ritz<br> would give you the best table.<br> God bless you.<br> See for yourself,<br> Mrs E Worthington Manville.<br> You'd make Cinderella look barefoot.<br> I don't know who that is in there.<br> I hope the whole thing isn't a dream.<br> Give me my basket.<br> Apples? Apples?<br> Your beautiful dream's<br> coming true, Annie.<br> God love you. Everybody's so wonderful...<br> and I'm so scared.<br> Come in.<br> Shades of Aphrodite, goddess of beauty!<br> Oh, that man just fills a room.<br> Never in all my questionable career<br> have I feasted my eyes<br> upon such divine loveliness.<br> Cut it out, Judge.<br> When's the Dude coming?<br> 8 o'clock, my fluttering dove, and bringing<br> the best-trained social lions you ever saw.<br> - But can they fool the count?<br> - Fret nyet, my pet.<br> You'll behold a miracle.<br> Orchids bloom where weeds once grew.<br> - What if they make mistakes?<br> - The Dude'll kill 'em.<br> - The poor dears.<br> - Pull yourself together, dearest.<br> You're the proud mother of a daughter<br> whose engagement is being announced.<br> And don't think of mistakes.<br> If any mug pulls a boner, I'll flood<br> the room with a torrent of oratory.<br> - You're wonderful, Judge.<br> - I know. Here's the receiving line plan.<br> You stand next to me,<br> then Louise, then the count...<br> - Yeah. And where am I?<br> - Right here.<br> Dude and his mob<br> are at Queenie Martin's.<br> - What are they doing there?<br> - I don't know.<br> It sure looks big. They got<br> a line of cars out here a block long.<br> - Stay on his tail. Don't let him get away.<br> - Right.<br> Let's close off the block.<br> Confidentially, at times I'm a bit ashamed<br> of my fellow Americans.<br> The way they fawn over celebrities,<br> particularly you titled nobility.<br> - I think that is charming.<br> - They're like children.<br> Tonight in your presence<br> they'll probably stammer<br> and appear to be<br> tongue-tied and awkward.<br> - I beg you to make allowances for them.<br> - But of course.<br> Different countries, different customs.<br> Which reminds me, Judge.<br> There is a custom in my country<br> which is not a custom in your country.<br> I have been hoping<br> that you would speak about it.<br> - Indeed, sir? What's on your mind?<br> - The dowry, my dear Judge.<br> As yet, nothing<br> has been said about the dowry.<br> - The dowry, huh?<br> - S.<br> I am aware, of course,<br> that in America it is not important.<br> But in my country<br> it is the first arrangement.<br> In your country, yes. In my country...<br> The dowry, huh?<br> I don't know what to say, Count.<br> - You crept up on me on that one.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> I mean, this is so totally unexpected.<br> Don't you think it's...<br> a bit vulgar to speak of money?<br> Well, let us be vulgar, then,<br> for a moment.<br> I am willing to make a settlement<br> equal to 50,000 of your dollars.<br> - You are? Of my dollars?<br> - S.<br> I have been hoping that you would be<br> willing to make a similar settlement.<br> Willing? Yes, yes, of course. Willing.<br> Ah. Old Napoleon.<br> Join me in a nippy with Nappy?<br> Delighted, Judge.<br> I see you keep your billiard table<br> in excellent condition.<br> - Do you play?<br> - Do I play?<br> Seor, in Barcelona I am the champion.<br> Well, now, isn't that just...<br> - You don't say?<br> - S.<br> Perhaps... a little game<br> before the guests arrive?<br> I can think of nothing<br> that would give me greater pleasure.<br> - Oh, about that dowry, Count.<br> - Yes, Judge?<br> It just occurred to me, as the young folks<br> are going back to Spain to live with you,<br> - I should give the whole amount.<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> I could not let you bear the entire burden.<br> But it's no burden, my dear Alfonso.<br> So, the matter's settled.<br> Please, my dear host.<br> You are so gracious.<br> You make me feel ashamed.<br> - I shall take care of the full amount.<br> - It's silly. We could debate this for hours.<br> In America we have methods<br> to settle such differences.<br> We toss coins or pull straws...<br> - What's so amusing, Alfonso?<br> - I could take advantage of you, Judge.<br> Indeed, sir? You wouldn't<br> suggest a billiards contest?<br> That's enough. You'll start sweatin'.<br> No sweatin'! Nobody sweats!<br> - Dude, it's gonna work, so help me.<br> - Get your coat, baby.<br> Dave! Come here. We're in, kid, we're in.<br> It's Darcey. Says you can write<br> your own ticket. Yes or no?<br> On my terms, Darcey?<br> All right. I'll tell you what you do.<br> You bring Little Switz<br> to pier 84 at midnight.<br> And bring the cash.<br> - What do you think of my apple now?<br> - I love it, I love it, I love it.<br> Ready, Dude.<br> Folks, Queenie and I are leaving now.<br> The rest of you follow in groups of four.<br> - And, Junior, you take over here.<br> - Good night.<br> Good luck, Dude.<br> Queenie, the Darcey deal's all set.<br> On my terms.<br> I'm gonna need you now more than ever.<br> So don't leave me.<br> OK, Dave.<br> Anything you say.<br> That's him.<br> Mr Dude, there's cops<br> all around the place.<br> Thank you, mister.<br> Like the boss said, you walk out...<br> - Boss, what's the matter?<br> - There's cops out there. Millions of 'em.<br> - Cops?<br> - What do we do now?<br> We can't go over to Annie's.<br> They'll follow us.<br> Queenie, get the judge on the phone.<br> We gotta stall 'em.<br> - What are they doing out there?<br> - I don't know. I don't figure it.<br> - I didn't do nothin'.<br> - Let me think.<br> - What amazing luck.<br> - I've been very fortunate, haven't I?<br> 24-24. You realise,<br> you make this shot, you win?<br> Really? This shot seems<br> practically impossible.<br> I have seen it made.<br> It's a seven-cushion shot<br> with high, delicate right-hand English.<br> - That would take an expert.<br> - I beg pardon, sir.<br> Mrs Manville's brother-in-law<br> on the telephone. He says it's very urgent.<br> I shall be there directly.<br> - You made it!<br> - Most fortunate. Most fortunate.<br> - The judge... expert.<br> - Oh, sir, I beat him regularly.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Hello, brother David. Congratulate me.<br> I just saved you $50,000.<br> Knock off the lousy jokes. We're in a jam.<br> The place is surrounded by bluecoats.<br> Cops?<br> I don't care for that at all, my dear Dude.<br> Would you suggest that I fold my tent<br> and silently scram into the night?<br> You better stay right where you are.<br> - Just stall 'em. I'll figure something out.<br> - Figure fast, Dude.<br> I'm notoriously poor at bag-holding.<br> - What is it, Henry?<br> - Nothing, my dear.<br> I heard you. You said<br> something about cops.<br> - They're not coming here, are they?<br> - Of course not.<br> - Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.<br> - Don't get yourself all worked up.<br> If something's going to happen,<br> I have got to know.<br> I'd rather tell them the truth myself.<br> Mama! Look what the count<br> gave me to wear tonight.<br> It's an heirloom that used to<br> belong to Queen Isabella.<br> - It's beautiful, dear.<br> - It's going to be mine after the wedding.<br> Carlos hasn't seen it on me.<br> She's a lovely girl, isn't she, Judge?<br> - Don't you think she's lovely?<br> - Angelic, my dear.<br> What am I going to do?<br> Suppose the count calls off the wedding.<br> She'd hate me.<br> Don't be silly, Annie.<br> She'll want to know who her father is.<br> What am I going to tell you?<br> You see, I was never married.<br> You won't have to tell her anything.<br> Now get a grip on yourself.<br> Dude'll come up with something.<br> He always does.<br> Before this evening is over,<br> I expect a complete apology from you.<br> - That is why I asked you here.<br> - My dear Count.<br> Nothing would give me greater<br> satisfaction than to be proven an imbecile.<br> What time do the guests arrive?<br> Well, no one arrives first, sir.<br> They all come in last.<br> - Hey, Boss...<br> - Will you knock it off?<br> Those bulls out there ain't got nothin'<br> on me, or they'd break that door down.<br> But how am I gonna get all these people<br> to Annie's without them cops tailin' us?<br> - You've got one ace in the hole.<br> - What's that?<br> - Give 'em what they want: The truth.<br> - The truth, to the cops?<br> Are you out of your skull?<br> Wait a minute. I got what they want.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm gonna go down and see<br> the commissioner and make a deal.<br> - The commissioner?<br> - Right. Take over, Junior.<br> - Joy Boy, come on.<br> - I don't like it. I don't like the whole thing.<br> Everybody, up on your feet.<br> I didn't like the way you bowed.<br> We're gonna do the bow.<br> Let's go.<br> Look, all I ask you, Commissioner,<br> is you just lay off me for tonight.<br> That's all? Don't you want me<br> to give you the keys to the city too?<br> - What's your mob doing at Queenie's?<br> - Nothin' that would interest you.<br> You see, I just can't tell anybody about it.<br> But if you'll just give me a base on balls<br> for tonight, I'll save your badge.<br> - What do you mean, save my badge?<br> - You wanna find those reporters.<br> - You got those reporters?<br> - I got friends.<br> All I gotta do is just<br> spread the word around those friends<br> and those newsboys will show up<br> tomorrow just as good as new.<br> All I ask you is, please,<br> just lay off me for tonight.<br> I don't make deals with bums. You'll have<br> a police escort until they show up.<br> Wait a minute. OK, Mac,<br> I'm gonna tell you something.<br> I got those reporters, and they ain't<br> showing up until I'm good and ready.<br> - Now are we gonna do business?<br> - Sure, Dude. We can do business.<br> - Frisk these guys and book 'em.<br> - What?<br> You can always do<br> business with the police.<br> - This ain't gonna get you noplace.<br> - Get me the mayor.<br> He's throwing that big party<br> for the governor.<br> - When he finds out what this is about...<br> - Why drag the mayor in?<br> I bet he'll make a deal with you too.<br> He'll probably settle for about 50 years.<br> There's nothing crooked going on here.<br> When you hear the story, you'll laugh.<br> I'm laughing already, Dude.<br> I been waitin' ten years to laugh at you.<br> - Hello, Chief.<br> - Hold it. Just before you talk to him...<br> Joy Boy, I told Queenie I'd tell the truth.<br> I'm gonna give you the truth.<br> You'll think I'm nuts, but it's the truth.<br> It's like...<br> - Well, it's...<br> - Like a Mother Goose story.<br> That's right. It's like one of those stories<br> you tell the kids when you put 'em to bed.<br> Hold on, Chief. Dave the Dude -<br> bootlegger, racketeer and gambler -<br> wants to tell me a beddy-bye story.<br> OK, forget it. I'm gonna hang before I let<br> any fink of a cop give me the horselaugh.<br> As for you, Mr Mayor... You tell Mr Mayor<br> he'll never see those reporters again.<br> - Dave the Dude is in my office.<br> - I've gotta use the phone.<br> He admits he's got those reporters.<br> Good work, Commissioner! Dave the Dude<br> admits having the reporters.<br> - Dave the what?<br> - Fancy-pants ex- bootlegger.<br> - Excellent. Have they arrested him?<br> - Of course, Governor.<br> But what do you suppose will happen<br> now? A bail bond and he's out laughing.<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> - That's the way things go down here.<br> Of all the nerve. Who does he think he is?<br> He can't make any deals with the police.<br> There's an example, Governor.<br> You see? He makes deals.<br> The Dude says if we don't let him alone<br> tonight we won't see the reporters again.<br> - Why, this is outrageous.<br> - Don't get excited, Governor.<br> It's quite the customary procedure.<br> Bring the Dude up here.<br> That's exactly what I said.<br> Bring him without delay.<br> Don't worry about my guests.<br> This is more important.<br> You criticise my administration.<br> Let's see what you can do with him.<br> - I'd send a criminal like that away for life.<br> - Here's your chance, Governor.<br> All right, Slops, up on your blisters.<br> You ain't bowing right.<br> Lay off, Junior. I've bowed so much,<br> I've got a callus on my bellybutton.<br> - Come on. Bow.<br> - Sit down, Junior. Save your strength.<br> Hello. Dude?<br> You're where? With the police?<br> You're gonna go over<br> and pick up the reporters?<br> Poor Annie.<br> All right. I'll go right over.<br> I feel sorry for the whole stinkin' world.<br> - What's it gonna be?<br> - It's all off.<br> Send the suits back. I'm sorry.<br> You can go home. Thanks for everything.<br> That's a shame.<br> You learned how to bow, didn't you?<br> I wish I could cry.<br> Come on, Junior.<br> There's nobody at Queenie Martin's.<br> No, no, Annie. Don't do anything foolish.<br> Mama? Isn't anybody coming?<br> Mama, what's wrong?<br> Louise, baby.<br> If you should...<br> If anything should happen...<br> Mama?<br> - You wouldn't hate your mother?<br> - Don't say things like that.<br> Is the count in the living room?<br> What is it, Mama?<br> La commedia finita.<br> Send the waiters and the musicians home<br> and call a doctor. Where's poor Annie?<br> Annie, I'm so sorry.<br> Count Romero, I'd like to talk to you<br> for a minute, please.<br> I'm sure you must know<br> there's nothing in the world I want more<br> than for my daughter to marry your son.<br> She loves him. Loves him very much.<br> And I know he loves her too.<br> Ever since Louise was born,<br> I've lived for one thing:<br> Her future.<br> And when she wrote me<br> that she'd found someone she loved...<br> I was the happiest mother in the world.<br> Count Romero, I know you came<br> to America to find out all about us,<br> about Louise's family.<br> - No, no, seora...<br> - No, I don't blame you. You have the right.<br> And it would be terrible after<br> they were married to find out that...<br> that Louise's mother was...<br> someone you would be ashamed of,<br> that even Louise would be ashamed of.<br> - That's silly, Mama.<br> - Mrs Manville...<br> Let me go on.<br> I wanted this talk<br> so you would find out all about me.<br> First of all, Count Romero,<br> I must tell you that... I am...<br> His Honour, the Mayor<br> of the city of New York.<br> Go ahead, Mayor.<br> It's your idea. Start beaming.<br> My dear Mrs Manville.<br> So good to see you again.<br> The last time I had the pleasure<br> was at your party at Briar Cliff.<br> I will never forget it.<br> It was a brilliant affair.<br> This, of course, is Louise,<br> the image of her late father.<br> - You're giving us the good news tonight?<br> - So nice to see you, dear.<br> You look just lovely.<br> Have you seen Lord Ferncliffe lately?<br> - Welcome to our city, sir.<br> - You look younger than in the newsreels.<br> Indeed? Thank you very much.<br> This is my son Carlos.<br> His Honour, the Mayor.<br> And you are the lucky young man.<br> Congratulations.<br> His Excellency, the Governor<br> of New York State.<br> My dear Mrs Manville, what a pleasure<br> to see you again so soon, and so radiant.<br> And this is the fabulous Louise.<br> I've always admired you, so her beauty<br> doesn't surprise me. You know my wife?<br> We're so happy to be here. We<br> wouldn't have missed this for the world.<br> Count, allow me<br> to welcome you to New York.<br> I'm crying.<br> Dude, I'm crying!<br> - Joy Boy, look, I'm crying!<br> - All right. I got my own troubles.<br> A police escort. That is more<br> than we get in Barcelona.<br> It's nothing, my dear Carlos.<br> I've had many a police escort.<br> How about that?<br> The mayor, the governor, the cops.<br> I thought they were all crooks.<br> Why did they do it?<br> They gotta have an angle.<br> Delightful experience.<br> Made me feel ten years younger.<br> Are you still gonna investigate<br> the mayor's administration, Governor?<br> I don't think so. I think we'll postpone it.<br> I must call the commissioner tomorrow. I<br> made his life miserable the last few days.<br> ...the engagement of their daughter Louise<br> to Carlos Romero of Barcelona, Spain,<br> at a gala reception last night, and so on.<br> Take it from there and<br> include a complete list of the guests.<br> - And that's your story, all of it.<br> - But what about our being snatched?<br> You weren't snatched.<br> You were out on a drunk.<br> - Drunk?<br> - Drunk.<br> We're going to the boat to see her off<br> Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day<br> Happy days must really be back<br> if you bums are taking cabs now.<br> - Pipe down. We're with the governor.<br> - Dry up. We're godfathers.<br> Fare thee well, fare thee well<br> Fare thee well, my dear Louise<br> For we're going to the boat to see her off<br> Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day<br> Little Switz? It's parked right behind you.<br> He's waiting. He's got<br> 100 G's in small bills.<br> Boss, you got business. Can I have<br> the night off? I gotta go see Ma.<br> Wait a minute. Listen, Dave.<br> My wife, I ain't seen her in a week.<br> And she's this way again, so...<br> - What do you say we split a cab?<br> - Come on.<br> - Elizabeth.<br> - Yeah.<br> Huh?<br> What was the name<br> of that town in Maryland?<br> Now, come on. Quit bawling.<br> My baby. My darling. God bless you.<br> Adis.<br> Courage, my pet.<br> Don't faint now. Courage.<br> Goodbye, Louise! Goodbye, Louise!<br> - Goodbye, Louise!<br> - Hey, hey, hey!<br> Why are you standing there<br> with your mouths open?<br> The crowd on this dock<br> is loaded. Start hustling.<br> Cos I'm gonna raise you<br> one buck a month to work on Broadway.<br> Goodbye, Louise!<br>
