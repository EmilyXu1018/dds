See you next time.<br> - Thank you.<br> Howdy.<br> You're the fella<br> moved into the old Quinn place.<br> Morning.<br> You moved out from the city?<br> I don't blame you.<br> In a world where<br> they can split a tiny atom...<br> and blow up hundreds<br> of thousands of people...<br> there's no telling<br> where it's all gonna lead.<br> Best to find a quiet place...<br> do what you have to do.<br> You don't have to pay me now.<br> What's your name?<br> Jackson Pollock.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, we finally made it.<br> How are you braving the winter?<br> No coal, no hot water,<br> no bathroom.<br> It's like Jack to want<br> others to share the misery.<br> - He loves it.<br> - How's he doing?<br> It's good for him<br> to be away from the city.<br> I guess you're here<br> to get Jackson drunk again.<br> Lee.<br> Well, let me think.<br> I never actually got Jack drunk.<br> He never really needed any help.<br> - He wrote us to spend the weekend.<br> - Rube--<br> I'm sure you understand.<br> Come on.<br> How you doin', fella?<br> Are you lost?<br> I'm gonna have to<br> find me more space.<br> How'd it go in there today?<br> Thought you might<br> make a table or something.<br> Get yourself working again.<br> Hello, bub.<br> Let's make a baby.<br> Am I missing something here?<br> Are you missing something?<br> We can't.<br> We can't?<br> My life is full enough<br> with you, Jackson.<br> Where are you going?<br> Don't walk away.<br> We're husband and wife.<br> I wanna have a baby.<br> Our baby.<br> That's what the progression of things is<br> about. That's what the union is about.<br> That's not what<br> the union is about.<br> What else is there?<br> - That's not what it's about.<br> - For me!<br> The vows don't stipulate "baby."<br> I am not going to bring<br> another life into that.<br> We are painters, Jackson.<br> We don't have any money.<br> We don't get by.<br> We struggle.<br> You are a great artist.<br> I believe in Jackson Pollock.<br> There's you<br> and there's the painting...<br> and you need, you need, you need!<br> And I don't want<br> to be anywhere else.<br> I don't want to be with...<br> anyone else.<br> But that's all I can handle.<br> - This is it?<br> - Please.<br> - Let's go inside for lunch.<br> - It's beautiful here.<br> - I want to see the paintings.<br> - Let's go see the paintings.<br> Let's go.<br> We've just moved to the barn.<br> They're here.<br> Can we come in?<br> Sure.<br> Now be careful.<br> I want you to meet Alfonso Ossorio.<br> This is Jackson Pollock.<br> And you know him.<br> Ted? Come on in.<br> Ted Dragon,<br> this is Jackson Pollock.<br> They came up for a preview of the show,<br> and I expect them to buy something.<br> It's beautiful.<br> You must be very happy here.<br> Damn near.<br> The country's wonderful.<br> Just enjoy.<br> Now, this one--<br> You're retreating into<br> imagery again, Jackson.<br> Paint is paint,<br> surface is surface.<br> That's all they should be.<br> Now this is--<br> This is first rate.<br> Why don't you do<br> eight or ten of those?<br> Paint is paint, surface is surface.<br> That's all they should be.<br> Paint is paint, surface is surface.<br> That's all they should be.<br> The surrealists confuse<br> literature with painting.<br> I can't stand that.<br> They will not have their way.<br> What you're doing out there<br> is better than anything...<br> I've seen from you<br> in a year or more.<br> No, I gotta backtrack.<br> Peggy's mural.<br> That's when I thought,<br> " Here's a great painter."<br> And people saying to me,<br> "It's wallpaper. It repeats itself."<br> It's always been my plan<br> to return to Europe.<br> I don't have the energy for it<br> since Howard died.<br> But Jackson needs a gallery.<br> What was the one that missed?<br> The one that wasn't so good?<br> I don't think you have color yet.<br> Like Picasso, you're much better off<br> when you keep your color quiet.<br> - Which one was it? I'll fix it.<br> - The one with all the blue.<br> - It's predominantly blue.<br> - The wrong blue? Too much blue?<br> All I want art to be is good, Jackson.<br> The picture misses.<br> And what do you think, Ted?<br> I think it's interesting.<br> I like blue.<br> - What do you think, Alfonso?<br> - I think it's your painting.<br> - But you think it misses.<br> - Clem may have a point, and he may not.<br> - You think it misses?<br> - I don't know.<br> You think it might miss?<br> Alfonso, you think it might miss?<br> - It might.<br> - I'll just go fix it for you.<br> - Is he all right, Lee?<br> - He's fine.<br> So it's all the blue<br> that's bothering you?<br> What else?<br> You want the color quiet?<br> - It could be a little quieter.<br> - Let's just quiet the color then.<br> Now, this is something.<br> - No matter how drunk you are--<br> - I'm not drunk.<br> One thing's sacred for you.<br> Not anybody's feelings<br> or anything like that.<br> It's your art.<br> You're not gonna destroy your art.<br> This is something.<br> He's had four shows with you, Peggy.<br> You can't suddenly not have a gallery.<br> You owe him.<br> Sam won't take him.<br> What did Betty Parsons say?<br> So? Everyone drinks.<br> He's not the only one.<br> I know, but he's a great painter.<br> Of course.<br> I'll call you back.<br> I'll have supper ready<br> in a jiffy.<br> Looks like Betty Parsons<br> may take you in.<br> Peggy's willing to continue<br> the monthly allowance through next year.<br> So she'll still own<br> all your unsold paintings...<br> but Betty will get a commission<br> on new work that sells.<br> You've done it, Pollock.<br> You've cracked it wide open.<br> Pass.<br> A nickel.<br> I'll see your nickel...<br> and I'll raise you...<br> a quarter.<br> I don't like<br> the look of that smile.<br> There is a smile of love<br> and there is a smile of deceit. I'm out.<br> I'm out.<br> - Too rich for my blood.<br> - Two two's.<br> "There is a smile of smiles...<br> in which these two smiles meet."<br> - William Blake.<br> - Such a bluffer.<br> Did you hear de Kooning<br> sold to the Modern?<br> Want me to deal?<br> "A singular concentration<br> of passion and technique...<br> fierce energy, virtuosity."<br> I guess it doesn't hurt that<br> his wife is fucking the critic.<br> - Who you talking about?<br> - De Kooning.<br> I don't know if I'd agree with<br> virtuosity, but it was a hell of a show.<br> Blah, blah, blah.<br> - Did you see the show?<br> - We're not in Siberia.<br> So you're the critic now.<br> No one knows I fuckin' exist.<br> Who the hell's talkin' about me?<br> I write about every<br> goddamn show you have.<br> You're the only one, Clem.<br> What good does your praise do me?<br> It's new stuff.<br> You gotta give it time.<br> We're broke!<br> I'm digging clams out of the bay.<br> I don't see de Kooning digging clams.<br> Everyone is struggling.<br> - It'll break for you soon.<br> - When?<br> Jackson, I just took part<br> in a roundtable on modern art...<br> held by Life magazine...<br> for God's sakes.<br> America has become the center<br> of Western civilization...<br> and what you're doing<br> is the most original...<br> and vigorous art in the country.<br> The rest of the critics will catch on.<br> You just keep at it.<br> I'm keepin' at it.<br> Don't tell me to keep at it.<br> I'm keepin' at it!<br> Did Clem ruffle your feathers?<br> - I love all women!<br> - You get off him!<br> Get off me!<br> He can take care of himself!.<br> This is my house!<br> Crazy bitch.<br> This is my house!<br> Okay, I'm glad that's over.<br> I'll be right there.<br> - Hey, Jackson.<br> - We owe you $56?<br> Sounds about right.<br> Hello, there, Jackson.<br> You oughta mind<br> your own fuckin' business, bub.<br> I'm tellin' you, Sande,<br> if I can do it, you can too.<br> It's been three weeks now.<br> Not a drop.<br> Hell, I quit for good.<br> We're still strugglin',<br> but Alfonso and Ted bought a painting.<br> We won't see any of the money till<br> I sell a bunch more, but guess what.<br> Demarest Fund came through.<br> Fifteen hundred bucks.<br> I bought a Model A.<br> Ninety bucks.<br> No, I'm not kiddin'.<br> It's just like we used to have.<br> Would you put Mom back on?<br> I'd like to say good night.<br> Okay, then tell 'em good night<br> from Uncle Jack.<br> I think the Macys<br> are going to buy.<br> Good.<br> - Are you here?<br> - That depends.<br> I'm sorry, he's painting right now.<br> This is Lee Krasner, his wife.<br> Yes.<br> Of course.<br> I'll let him know.<br> Bye.<br> Life magazine.<br> They want to do<br> an article on you.<br> Damn.<br> I don't let the image<br> carry the painting.<br> If it creeps in,<br> I try to do away with it...<br> to let the painting come through.<br> Hold it a minute there, please.<br> Pollock spends hours<br> contemplating a painting.<br> It may be days or even months<br> before he tackles it again.<br> Who are your favorite artists?<br> De Kooning...<br> Kandinsky.<br> EI Greco, Goya, Rembrandt.<br> How do you respond<br> to some of your critics?<br> They have said,<br> "A mop of tangled hair."<br> "A child's contour map<br> of the Battle of Gettysburg."<br> "Cathartic disintegration."<br> What do you say to that?<br> - You forgot "baked macaroni."<br> - Well?<br> Well, if people would just...<br> leave most of their stuff at home<br> and just look at the paintings...<br> I don't think they'd have<br> any trouble enjoying them.<br> It's like looking<br> at a bed of flowers.<br> You don't tear your hair out<br> over what it means.<br> How do you know when<br> you're finished with a painting?<br> How do you know when<br> you're finished making love?<br> That's better.<br> Just be yourself.<br> Delivery.<br> Have you seen this...<br> Life magazine article?<br> I have plenty if you want one.<br> Enjoy the show.<br> Cheer up.<br> I'm gonna go sell a big one.<br> Take a look around, fellas.<br> These are the big shots.<br> Jackson broke the ice.<br> Hi. How are you?<br> - Do you know the Petersons?<br> - No.<br> This is Betty Parsons.<br> Hi, Mom.<br> Pollock showed 30 pictures last fall<br> and sold all but five...<br> and his collectors<br> are nibbling at those.<br> Mr. Pollock, in your opinion,<br> what is the meaning of modern art?<br> Mr. Pollock, in your opinion,<br> what is the meaning of modern art?<br> Modern art, to me...<br> is nothing more than...<br> the expression<br> of the contemporary aims...<br> of the age that we're living in.<br> Did the classical artists<br> have any means of expressing their age?<br> Yes, and they did it very well.<br> All cultures have had<br> means and techniques...<br> of expressing their...<br> immediate aims.<br> The thing that interests me...<br> is that today...<br> painters do not have to go to<br> a subject matter outside of themselves.<br> They work from a different source.<br> They work from within.<br> It seems tome...<br> that the modern artist<br> cannot express this age--<br> the airplane, the atom bomb,<br> the radio--<br> in the old forms<br> of the Renaissance...<br> or any other past culture.<br> How do you go about<br> getting the paint on the canvas?<br> I understand you don't use brushes<br> or anything of that sort.<br> I paint on the floor.<br> That's not unusual.<br> The Orientals did that.<br> Most of the paint I use<br> is a liquid flowing kind of paint.<br> The brushes I use<br> are used more as sticks.<br> The brush doesn't actually<br> touch the canvas...<br> but just above it.<br> Isn't it more difficult to control,<br> and isn't there more of possibility...<br> of getting too much paint,<br> or splattering, or any number of things?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> With experience...<br> it seems possible to control...<br> the flow of the paint<br> to a great extent...<br> and I don't use--<br> I don't use the accident...<br> 'cause I deny the accident.<br> Did you see<br> the Magazine of Art review?<br> It was a public recant,<br> a complete switcheroo.<br> Five years ago, he called<br> Pollock's work "baked macaroni."<br> Now he says,<br> "an impregnable language of image--<br> beautiful and subtle patterns<br> of pure form."<br> - You all made it.<br> - Yeah, we made it.<br> How was it?<br> Hi, Elizabeth.<br> Good to see you.<br> You must be Jeremy.<br> Dad drove 1 00 miles an hour<br> all the way from L.A.<br> Hey, how are you?<br> How you doin'?<br> Hi, Charles.<br> Hi, Jack.<br> - How are you, Karen?<br> - She's pleased to meet you.<br> Hi, Mom.<br> It's so nice to have<br> all my boys together.<br> I'm so glad everybody's here.<br> How you doin'?<br> How was the trip?<br> He's so heavy.<br> I miss you, you son of a bitch.<br> I miss you. It's just not the same.<br> Nothin' was ever the same<br> to begin with.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Shangri-la.<br> Everybody okay down there?<br> You hit the big time, Jack.<br> How many did you sell from that<br> November show? Mother wrote 18.<br> That was the best show I ever had.<br> It all gets poured back into the house.<br> I'm thinking of buying the acreage next<br> door, put up a studio for Lee maybe.<br> Free up the upstairs bedroom,<br> give her more space.<br> I think he probably articulated<br> the profundity of Jackson's art...<br> more eloquently than anyone has.<br> - How are they?<br> - Fine. Mother's reading Peter Pan.<br> This one here, this is from<br> the most recent Art News.<br> - Story about a boy who never grew up.<br> - Another rave.<br> I can't wait to see what he's<br> gonna say about Jackson's next show.<br> I'm not sure<br> I always get it, Jack.<br> I'm the only painter<br> worth looking at in America.<br> - There really isn't anyone else.<br> - I expect that's true, Jack.<br> - This guy wants to make a film on me.<br> - Why?<br> Well, they made one on Calder.<br> I have a show coming up<br> at the Circle Gallery.<br> I'm exhibiting under<br> the name Charles Pima.<br> What the hell you doin' that for?<br> This is priced at 4,000.<br> Buy it for 1 ,500.<br> It'll be worth 1 00,000 someday.<br> -Just any kind for me.<br> - I'll have a cherry.<br> Does anybody speak Italian?<br> I need somebody<br> who speaks Italian.<br> Do you speak Italian?<br> Here it is, Arte Moderna.<br> We figured out that much-- " Modern Art."<br> There's an article about me.<br> Does anybody know<br> what that means?<br> Does anybody wanna play anagrams?<br> Here's something about<br> " Povro Picasso."<br> Povro Picasso.<br> Did you hear that?<br> What do you think that means?<br> - I think it means "poor Picasso."<br> - Poor Picasso?<br> Like poor? Did you guys hear that?<br> Poor Picasso!<br> Is Picasso more important<br> than your family?<br> I had this dream.<br> I'm at the edge of a cliff, and my<br> brothers are there, all four of them...<br> and they're trying<br> to push me off the cliff.<br> Goddamn fuckin' nightmare.<br> We're rollin'.<br> Now come back in.<br> We're rollin'.<br> Now come back in.<br> Don't stop.<br> That's good.<br> Stop, stop.<br> Go to the chair, sit down.<br> Put your shoes on.<br> Your head's too low.<br> Lift it up.<br> Don't talk. We see your mouth moving.<br> You're supposed to be alone.<br> Cut.<br> We gotta do it again.<br> You can't talk.<br> Now sit down.<br> Don't look at camera.<br> That's good. Shoes.<br> That's better.<br> That looks good.<br> Cut, cut, cut.<br> You need to take more time looking.<br> Like-- I don't know.<br> Like you're thinking or wondering.<br> Cut.<br> Jackson, cut.<br> Cut. We ran out of film.<br> Just tell him<br> you don't wanna do it.<br> I can't.<br> Not polite.<br> It's been a month.<br> He wants to get it right.<br> It's not just that, anyway.<br> I feel like a phony.<br> You're a great painter, Pollock.<br> Just paint.<br> He wants to shoot through glass<br> so he can see my face.<br> You're the star.<br> I feel like a clam<br> without a shell.<br> Fuck him.<br> Fuck him. It's not for you.<br> I think it's gonna be<br> your best show ever, Jackson.<br> Everything works.<br> The big pictures...<br> the smaller ones.<br> It's phenomenal.<br> I don't think<br> it's going to sell, though.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - Will do.<br> I can't believe<br> they're still out there.<br> He's gotta be frozen.<br> Hello! Happy Thanksgiving!<br> Yeah. The light's gone.<br> That's it, Jackson.<br> We're done.<br> It's great. It's marvelous.<br> Jackson, where have you been?<br> Jackson, please.<br> Damn it, Hans, we need this.<br> Come in here.<br> Here, this one's for you.<br> First drink I've had<br> in two years.<br> Don't be a fool, Jackson.<br> Carve the turkey for me.<br> - The gravy.<br> - Anybody wanna eat?<br> The turkey will be served.<br> I'm not the phony,<br> you're the phony.<br> - Let's eat!<br> - Let's eat.<br> - I'm not the phony, you're the phony.<br> -Jackson, enough.<br> No. I want you<br> sitting next to me.<br> Come on, sit next to me.<br> Here you go.<br> I'm so hungry.<br> I'm sitting next to my buddy.<br> I'm not the phony,<br> you're the phony.<br> How about a toast<br> to our hostess?<br> - Should I do it now, Hans?<br> - Here we go.<br> - Now?<br> - Stop it.<br> Now, Hans?<br> Now?<br> Now!<br> I understand there was a ruckus<br> over my Partisan Review article.<br> Go find it, Lee.<br> Jewish cunt.<br> Lee's the one who wants you here.<br> I call 'em the way I see 'em.<br> Do you want it any other way?<br> You call 'em the way you see 'em?<br> I'm traded in for Clyfford Still.<br> Jackson, that's not<br> what Clem's saying.<br> Clyfford Still is one of<br> the most original painters around.<br> - If not the best?<br> - If not the best.<br> - Did you read the article?<br> - I read the whole goddamn thing.<br> - Clem wasn't trading you for Still.<br> - Then what was he doing?<br> The article was about the direction<br> of modern art. It's not just about you.<br> - I'm talking to him.<br> - If you--<br> I'm not talking to you!<br> Shut up!<br> You didn't review '52,<br> the '54 show was "forced and pumped."<br> - Is that right?<br> - As I saw it.<br> Have I lost my stuff, Clem?<br> Everybody loses their stuff, Jackson.<br> You had a good ten-year run.<br> Everything's gorgeous.<br> Gorgeous isn't good enough.<br> What do you want from me?<br> I like " Easter and the Totem."<br> Is it as good as the Peterson<br> it was next to at the Carnegie exhibit?<br> The Peterson was better.<br> I had something goin'<br> in that picture, but it missed.<br> I had something goin' in "The Deep" too,<br> but it just missed.<br> - "The Deep" was a kiss-ass to Still.<br> - No one asked you!<br> Clyfford Still couldn't<br> polish Jackson's shoes.<br> Look what you were painting<br> when you were sober.<br> Now that you're back on booze,<br> do you paint real pictures?<br> - Climb off my back, bitch!<br> - You're a goddamn bum!<br> Open that mouth again,<br> I'll kill you!<br> You are killing me!<br> You are killing me!<br> Bitch!

I could care less!<br> You don't wanna stay here.<br> You won't be able to stand it.<br> This is morning to night. This happens<br> when we're taking out the garbage!<br> What are you lookin' for?<br> What are you pushin' me for?<br> Stop crying about it and paint!<br> You're Jackson Pollock<br> and you don't paint!<br> It's a tragedy<br> and I can't stand it!<br> Paint!<br> - You look great.<br> - Thanks. I missed you.<br> - Don't look at me that way.<br> - I'm not looking at you.<br> I was thinking we could visit Peggy<br> in Venice, see the Biennale.<br> Time to go to Europe<br> is when you're very young...<br> or very old.<br> But you should go.<br> Everybody should do<br> what the hell they wanna do.<br> She left it in the car.<br> I'm surprised she hasn't missed it.<br> You take her<br> where our friends are.<br> They have the good grace<br> not to tell me.<br> If you don't stop seeing her,<br> I'm going to leave you.<br> - I love her.<br> - You don't.<br> She's my last chance.<br> I am not going<br> to give you a divorce.<br> If you could be anybody...<br> who ever lived...<br> in the history<br> of the whole world...<br> who would you be?<br> You.<br> I'd better get that.<br> - Hello?<br> - I'm ridiculous.<br> I think I left<br> my passport at the house.<br> I suppose I'll have to wait<br> till the next sailing.<br> Oh, here it is.<br> I found it.<br> Buried in my purse.<br> I owe the woman something.<br> I'd be dead without her.<br> But I'm the one<br> who loves you, Jackson.<br> The roses were...<br> the most beautiful deep red.<br> I miss you, and wish<br> you were sharing this with me.<br> It would be wonderful<br> to get a note from you.<br> The painting here<br> is unbelievably bad.<br> How are you, Jackson?<br> Kiss Gyp for me.<br> Love, Lee.<br> What have you got there,<br> Mr. Pollack?<br> I found him hit on the road.<br> He's a beautiful dog.<br> You gotta save him.<br> He's a beautiful dog.<br> Keep a girl waiting,<br> why don't you?<br> This is my friend, Edith Metzger.<br> Just throw your stuff in the back.<br> We'll fit in the front, I think.<br> Thanks.<br> Edith wants to go<br> to the beach today.<br> We're all set and ready to go.<br> You go.<br> We'll wait for you.<br> Okay?<br> Are we going?<br> He's taking a little nap.<br> He'll be down in a little bit.<br> - Is he sick?<br> - No, he's fine.<br> Let's go see the studio.<br> What's doin' for tonight?<br> I'm invited to Rosario's for...<br> a "musicale" or<br> somethin' or other benefit.<br> That could be fun.<br> Let's go.<br> I don't want to see<br> all those people.<br> Come on, I wanna take<br> a picture with you.<br> Edith, take our picture.<br> Okay, here we go.<br> Leave the dishes.<br> - Get dressed.<br> - We don't have to go, Jackson.<br> Really, you don't<br> have to amuse me.<br> Leave the dishes.<br> Get dressed.<br> What's the matter, Jackson?<br> Are you all right?<br> - I'm gonna call for help.<br> - Don't go in there.<br> - I don't wanna drive with him.<br> - Get her back in the car.<br> He's fine.
