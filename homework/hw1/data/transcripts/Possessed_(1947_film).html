My name isn't David, lady.<br> What?<br> Okay. You, lady?<br> Coffee?<br> Would you reach me the sugar?<br> Hey, you. Say, you drunk?<br> Here's your coffee.<br> Hey, what's the matter with you?<br> - She looks sick.|- Are you sick or something?<br> - Where did you pick her up?|- Sixth and Main.<br> Does she show any signs|of physical injury?<br> Not as far as we could make out.<br> How many fingers?<br> Pulse low and irregular.<br> What's your name?<br> Can you hear me?<br> It looks like a coma.<br> - Diabetic?|- I don't think so.<br> - It's a non-traumatic stupor.|- Take her to Psycho.<br> How many does this make?<br> Twenty today. One manic, three seniles...<br> - six alcoholics, and 10 schizos.|- Going up all the time.<br> This civilization of ours is a worse disease|than heart trouble or tuberculosis.<br> We can't escape it.|Well, what have we here?<br> Catatonic stupor.|She was in shock, but she's out now.<br> I see.<br> Beautiful woman, intelligent...<br> frustrated.<br> Frustrated, just like the others we've seen.|It's always the same.<br> Problem of some kind.<br> Simple, perhaps, but she was unable|to cope with it. And now this.<br> Complete confusion.<br> Hypoactive deep reflexes throughout.<br> Catatonic posturing,|waxy flexibility of the extremities.<br> Your diagnosis was correct, Craig.|Let me see the chart.<br> "Name unknown.|Previous medical history, unknown.<br> "Age, education, profession, if any,|unknown." All unknown.<br> "Patient's clothing bears label from|stores in Washington, D.C.<br> "Woman who saw her on the street said|she was asking for a man called David."<br> That's something to go on, at least.|Not much, but something.<br> Anyway.<br> David.<br> Well, hello, there.<br> I'm Dr. Willard. We're going to help you.<br> Feeling better?<br> Better? Much better.<br> You come from Washington, don't you?|Washington, D. C.<br> Where do you live in Washington?<br> Well, what's this?<br> You're married, aren't you?<br> What's your husband's name?<br> Is your husband's name David?<br> What's your name?<br> You can talk, you know. You just did.<br> You said "David."|Now you don't say anything.<br> Why is that?<br> Well, tell me this, at least.|How do you feel?<br> I said, "How do you feel?"<br> I...<br> feel...<br> That's fine, go on.<br> I...<br> You can't find the words, can you?<br> You want to, but you can't.<br> Something preventing you, is that it?<br> Just nod your head if I'm right.<br> I see.<br> We'll have to do something about that.<br> She shows marked thought blocking,|almost complete mutism.<br> Now, then...<br> in order to help you, we've got to find out|something about you...<br> and to find out about you...<br> we've got to make it possible|for you to talk.<br> We'll try narcosynthesis.<br> Seven-and-a-half grains in 10 cc's|of sterile distilled water.<br> Yes, Dr. Willard.<br> That's fine.

That's better, isn't it?<br> Now you can think much more clearly,|can't you?<br> That's much better.<br> Much better.<br> It's all right. You're in a hospital.<br> Hospital?<br> What hospital?<br> Why?<br> You became very ill in a restaurant.|Don't you remember?<br> No.<br> I don't believe you.<br> - I'd like to leave now.|- All right.<br> You help us to make you well again,|then you can leave.<br> That's fair enough, isn't it?<br> What's your name?<br> Louise Howell.<br> You live in Washington?<br> Why are you in Los Angeles?<br> - To get away from them.|- From them?<br> - They must never know.|- What mustn't they ever know?<br> That's why I came here.<br> I wanted to disappear.<br> - They must never know.|- Now, now.<br> Don't get excited.<br> What is it you don't want them to know?<br> I'm not going to tell you everything.<br> All right. You just tell me|what you want to, that's all.<br> Tell me about... David.<br> - David?|- Yes. Who is David?<br> Someone's playing Schumann|on the piano.<br> - I don't like it.|- No one's playing the piano, really.<br> Yes.<br> Listen. There.<br> Hear it?<br> I don't like it.<br> Make them play it softer.<br> That's better. It's nice.<br> That's fine. Tell me...<br> who was playing the piano?<br> David.<br> We were swimming, it was cold.<br> Now he's playing Schumann.<br> What're you doing? Louise?<br> I'm getting dressed, it's almost time to go.<br> We never seem to have|enough time together.<br> What?<br> I said, we never seem to have|enough time together.<br> The days aren't long enough.<br> Not our days.<br> The others are too long.<br> You aren't even listening.<br> I'm making love to the piano.<br> One of my more attractive|minor accomplishments.<br> For Miss Louise Howell, Schumann.<br> And for the other women you've known?<br> The other women? It depends. Gershwin...<br> something light and frivolous, Mozart.<br> But for you, Schumann.<br> - Tenderness.|- Thank you.<br> I wish I hadn't gotten dressed.|We could go swimming again.<br> It would be lovely|swimming in the moonlight. Beautiful.<br> It would be too cold.<br> You haven't enough romance in your soul.<br> - Why don't you go?|- Alone?<br> It wouldn't be any fun that way.<br> Besides, I have to leave soon.<br> Will you miss me?<br> Will you be Ionely?<br> Do you love me?<br> You say the most beautiful things.<br> Your hair's still wet from swimming,|back there.<br> You know that?<br> Smells wonderful.<br> Why do they still make perfumes like|Bouquet de Fleurs...<br> as if things still happened|in flower gardens?<br> If they turned out something like...<br> Wet Hair After Swimming,|they'd have something.<br> I love you, David.<br> "I love you" is such an inadequate way|of saying I love you.<br> It doesn't quite describe|how much it hurts sometimes.<br> Love gives me the sniffles,|and then my nose gets red.<br> - Why?|- Because I'm happy, because I'm in love.<br> - That's no reason.|- Yes, it is.<br> At least for a woman, it is.<br> Would you like to know something?<br> What?<br> Before I met you...<br> I never felt very keenly one way or another|about anything.<br> - I wasn't happy, I...|- Sad?<br> No, I just existed.<br> I never realized what a dreary life it was,|till I met you.<br> David, I want a monopoly on you.<br> Or whatever people have, when they don't|want anyone else to have any of you.<br> Don't, Louise.<br> Don't what?<br> Don't start bringing the subject around|to marriage again.<br> Oh, Promise Me.<br> - Why? What's wrong with it?|- It's a duet and I like to play solo.<br> I'm not in love with you like that,|you know that.<br> Not like that.<br> Don't be angry.<br> - I'm not angry.|- Yes, you are.<br> Why is it when a man gets interested|in his work, or a book, or something...<br> a woman has to always start|acting like a woman?<br> Because she doesn't want him|to get lost in anything but her.<br> Darling, in mathematics|you never, never lose yourself.<br> In life, very often. In love, always.<br> But in mathematics, two and two are|always four. And that's wonderful.<br> Let me show you this.<br> You see?<br> It's just a curve.<br> Well, yes, it's a parabola.<br> That's something that a mathematician|could fall in love with.<br> I've been working on that|for over four years.<br> I started when I was in the army, in Africa.<br> It's a girder, a molded girder.<br> The army couldn't use it...<br> but a construction engineer|would give his right arm for that.<br> Why don't you love me like that?<br> I'm much nicer than a girder|and a lot more interesting.<br> I have no pride,|you didn't know that, did you?<br> David...<br> I've never had anything in the whole world|I ever wanted, except you.<br> I used to be cold, shut in,|I didn't mind because...<br> nothing hurt me very much then, but...<br> I just can't go back being on the outside|of people's lives, looking in.<br> Louise, we're all on the outside|of other people's lives looking in.<br> You wouldn't like being on the inside|of my life, anyway.<br> There's nothing there|but a few mathematical equations...<br> and a lot of question marks.<br> Darling, I honestly think|we'd better not see each other for a while.<br> Why?<br> - Why, David, what have I done?|- Nothing.<br> Knowing you has been wonderful,|but you hang on to me too hard.<br> Sometimes I get the feeling|that you're choking me to death.<br> Everyone wants to be loved,|but no one wants to be smothered.<br> This whole thing, it's getting too involved.<br> It was never meant to go this far,|you know that.<br> - We agreed to that a long time ago.|- I know, but...<br> it's the sort of thing that people say|before they fall in love.<br> Louise, I hadn't wanted to tell you this|for a while...<br> but I think, now, maybe I should.<br> - I've had...|- David, please take me home.<br> - Waiting won't make it easier.|- Take me home, David.<br> David, I can't run away from it any longer.<br> What were you going to tell me?<br> I don't know what I want just now,|but I have to keep moving until I get it.<br> Blame it on the army, blame it on the war,|blame it on anything you like, but...<br> - that's the way it is.|- All right, go.<br> Go wherever you like.<br> But let me wait for you.|At least let me do that.<br> No. I won't be back this way.<br> Louise, you have got to let go.<br> I can't love you the way you love me.|I never could.<br> Believe me, someday you're gonna be glad|you're rid of me.<br> Won't you try to understand?<br> - Nobody caring what happens to me.|- When you're calm, I'll talk to you.<br> All right, run away.<br> - Miss Howell.|- Good evening, Mr. Graham.<br> I understood you were employed|to take care of my wife.<br> - Yes.|- Why don't you?<br> This is my day off, Mr. Graham.<br> - I see. Well, go and look after her.|- Yes, sir.<br> You'll find her rather upset, I'm afraid.<br> Who is that? Is that you, Dean?<br> - I told you...|- It's Louise, I'll be with you in a minute.<br> I don't want you to do anything for me.|I won't have you touch me.<br> Not after what's been going on|between you and my husband.<br> Nothing's been going on, Mrs. Graham,|you know that.<br> Don't try to fool me.<br> I can tell you're up to something|just by looking at you.<br> Where have you been all day?|Who were you with?<br> No one you'd be interested in.|Why don't you try and get some rest?<br> How can I rest? Lying here all alone,|no one to look after me...<br> nobody to care.|Even my own husband hates me.<br> That's not true, you know|he's very upset when you're unhappy.<br> He should be upset,|it's his fault I'm like this. All his fault.<br> - Is that you, Miss Howell?|- Yes, Mr. Graham.<br> - Have you a moment?|- Certainly.<br> I wanted to apologize for being so abrupt|when you came in this evening.<br> I'd just gone through|a rather unpleasant half-hour.<br> I understood that, Mr. Graham.<br> I imagine you were subjected|to much the same sort of thing, just now.<br> - I hope it wasn't too difficult for you.|- I'm used to difficult patients.<br> You have a magnificent detachment,|Miss Howell.<br> I wish I might achieve it.<br> I'm glad you weren't upset by my wife's|rather vivid imagination.<br> No, I wasn't upset, but I wondered...<br> I think I should leave.<br> Under the circumstances,|I think it would be better.<br> This has happened before, Miss Howell,|many times before.<br> There's every reason to believe|it will happen again.<br> My wife is fully convinced|that I spend all my free time...<br> making advances to her nurses...<br> or any other female who enters this house.<br> Your leaving wouldn't change that.<br> It would, however, deprive me|of your very capable presence.<br> If you can bring yourself to ignore|these fancies of Mrs. Graham...<br> I'd like very much to have you stay.<br> - All right, I'll stay.|- Good, it's settled.<br> I won't bother you any further|with my troubles.<br> - Good morning.|- Good morning.<br> Leave the rest to me,|Mr. Graham will want his breakfast.<br> - Any luck?|- Caught two trout.<br> I thought I'd save some money|and catch my own breakfast. Good idea.<br> - How long were you out?|- About three hours.<br> Figuring what your time's worth|those fish cost you $1,000 apiece.<br> I got cheated on Junior.|He's only worth about $500.<br> How's Mrs. Graham this morning?<br> Feeling well enough to come down here|for breakfast.<br> Good.<br> That's David Sutton.<br> Hi, Dean.<br> - Catch anything?|- Enough for breakfast.<br> - Can I see you a minute?|- Sure.<br> You're going to talk business,|I'd better go.<br> Sutton won't mind.|I'd like you to meet him.<br> Some other time, perhaps.|I have things to do.<br> - Hello.|- Hello.<br> - You know each other?|- Yes, sure.<br> I saw you out fishing.|I thought I'd drop over and say hello.<br> - How are Pauline and the kids?|- They're fine. What's on your mind?<br> You remember our little talk|Saturday at the club?<br> - Vaguely.|- Could we finish it?<br> Operator, I'm waiting|for that call to Montreal.<br> All right, I'll hold on.<br> - Some coffee?|- No, thanks. I've had breakfast.<br> - Don't let me interrupt yours, now.|- I won't.<br> Now, what about this Canadian deal?<br> Well, I know your company is surveying|a new field up there.<br> I know you're within six months|of production.<br> All right, I'll hold on.<br> How do you know all this?<br> Subterranean rumbles|from the underground. It's true, isn't it?<br> It might be. Why?|What particular rumble interests you?<br> That cracking plant|that you're going to build.<br> You'll need a structural engineer,|a good one.<br> Me.<br> Someday we must have a long chat|about your sources of information.<br> Maybe we will.|Meanwhile, I'm looking for a job. That one.<br> No, seriously, Dean. You know my record.<br> You know I'm as good a man|as you could get.<br> Hello, Charlie. Hold on a minute.<br> When could you leave for Canada?<br> Tonight, tomorrow, anytime.<br> Charlie, do you know anything|about an engineer named Sutton?<br> David Sutton.<br> Do you think he'd be a|good man for the Lac du Pont project?<br> Start packing.<br> Louise.<br> Where are you, Louise?<br> I'm ready to go down.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, Louise.<br> David, I want to talk to you.<br> - All right. But does it have to be here?|- Here, now.<br> - What is it?|- I tried to get you on the phone last night.<br> I tried again this morning,|but you weren't at home.<br> I was home.<br> Then you wouldn't answer|because you knew it was me.<br> - David, we have no reason to quarrel.|- I agree completely.<br> I don't know why you're angry with me.<br> - I'm not angry.|- Please let me finish.<br> Whatever it is I've done,|or you think I've done...<br> I really haven't done anything, David,|but whatever it is, I'm sorry.<br> You have nothing to be sorry for,|you haven't done anything.<br> I've been thinking about us all night.<br> I couldn't sleep.<br> It's awful to lie down at night|and not be able to sleep.<br> But I do know|that we can work things out.<br> I'll do anything you say, David,|just as long as we're together.<br> That's all I want.<br> - David, why can't we be together?|- I told you why last night.<br> Louise, don't hang on to me.|You'll get hurt.<br> You're in love with someone else,|aren't you?<br> There isn't anybody else.<br> Don't please read hidden meanings|into everything I say.<br> If I were in love with anybody else,|believe me, I'd tell you.<br> There is another woman, I know it.<br> Otherwise why should you suddenly|decide to go off to Canada?<br> How did you know about Canada?<br> You didn't think I'd find out, did you?|But I did, I listened.<br> I listened at the door.<br> Do you see the things you make me do?<br> I'll do anything|because I don't care anymore.<br> You can't go away without me, David.|I won't let you. I'll find a way.<br> I'll lie if I have to, but I'll find a way.<br> David, I didn't mean that.|I don't know why I ever said such a thing.<br> David, I'm sorry. Please don't be angry.<br> David, listen to me. You mustn't|treat me this way. Don't leave me.<br> Take me with you. David!<br> David...<br> where are you?<br> Don't leave me.<br> Now, try and be calm.<br> Tell me, how did you feel|when he left you?<br> What were you thinking?<br> He did it deliberately, to humiliate me.<br> He even pretended it was because|I was too much in love with him.<br> But he didn't fool me any.<br> He planned it that way.<br> They all knew about it.<br> Dean...<br> his wife, Pauline, the others.<br> They all did it deliberately.<br> Just to make me feel miserable.<br> To make me...<br> like this.<br> Try and rest a while.|Try not to think of anything.<br> Do you notice the beginnings|of the persecution complex?<br> "They did it deliberately. Part of a plan.|Wanted to hurt me."<br> No attempt to evaluate the situation|or see the man's viewpoint.<br> No judgment, lack of insight.|Classic symptoms.<br> - This is where the psychosis began.|- Even further back, Doctor.<br> She said herself that before she met him,|she'd never felt anything very keenly.<br> That's lack of emotional response.<br> I think the exact term she used was,|"I wasn't happy, I wasn't sad."<br> Typical schizoid detachment,|split personality.<br> Yes, the seeds were there...<br> and her obsession for this man|made them grow.<br> Well, let's go on.<br> How do you feel?<br> Do you want to continue?<br> Don't go to sleep now.|Stay awake and talk to me.<br> - Would you like to go on?|- Yes.<br> I'll tell you, I know you can help me.<br> I know...<br> - Would you like a glass of water?|- No.<br> It was black then.<br> Cold, very cold, and black.<br> I found her!<br> Okay, Lieutenant.<br> I hoped it wouldn't be true.<br> I feel it's all my fault.|If only I hadn't gone into the village.<br> You weren't to blame.<br> You look so tired. Why don't you go|in the house and lie down?<br> Let me stay here.|I'll do whatever's necessary.<br> Thank you, Miss Howell. I'll be all right.<br> Please, Mr. Graham,|I'm worried about you.<br> We were too late, Mr. Graham.|Much too late. I'm sorry.<br> I wonder if you'd mind|coming with me for a minute?<br> Certainly.<br> I have to make a report.<br> Just routine, you understand,|otherwise I wouldn't trouble you.<br> I understand your wife|used to come here quite often.<br> Yes, she loved this spot.<br> She'd suddenly get out of bed|and come here and spend hours.<br> Who are you?<br> - Louise Howell, Mrs. Graham's nurse.|- Why did Mrs. Graham need a nurse?<br> She'd been ill for years.|She thought she'd never be well again.<br> However, Dr. Sherman, her physician,|can tell you more about that.<br> I understand Mrs. Graham|wasn't missed till about 7:00.<br> That's right. When the maid|took her dinner up, she was gone.<br> We weren't called until 8:15.<br> Everyone thought|perhaps she'd gone for a walk.<br> Although she didn't ordinarily do that|without telling someone.<br> When her slippers were found here,|I thought it best to call you.<br> I see.<br> Where were you all this time,|Miss Howell?<br> I was in the village. This was my day off.<br> I never should have left her alone.<br> - I blame myself for this.|- Why should you? It was your day off.<br> How do you think|the accident happened, Mr. Graham?<br> It wasn't an accident.|She did it deliberately.<br> If you don't want me for anything else,|I have some calls to make.<br> Mr. Graham's children are away at school|and they have to be notified.<br> - Would you like me to tell them?|- No, I'll take care of that.<br> Do you think it was suicide, Miss Howell?<br> - She had spells of extreme depression.|- Evidently.<br> She must've been trapped by the weeds.<br> Weeds grow very long here,|near the shore.<br> Then, I guess the current carried her out.<br> The body was found out here.<br> This is the rock|where Mrs. Graham's slippers were found.<br> - Would you pass that on to the jury?|- Yes.<br> - What time were you called, Lieutenant?|- 8:15.<br> Sergeant got the call from the house.<br> We got here about 9:00 and...<br> we didn't find the body till approximately|2:30 in the morning.<br> Well, I guess that's all.|Except for one thing.<br> A statement by Mr. Graham.<br> You don't usually hear a man|say a thing like that...<br> especially about his wife,|so I wrote it down.<br> I asked him:<br> "How do you think the accident|happened, Mr. Graham?"<br> His exact answer was...<br> Anything I said that night was not...|I was under great strain.<br> - It's not evidence.|- Just a moment, Dean.<br> I should like to remind the coroner,|that Mr. Graham has not been well.<br> We' re aware|of Mr. Graham's condition, Doctor.<br> It's largely the reason why this hearing|is being held here...<br> instead of the county courthouse.<br> However, anything that pertains|to the events of the evening...<br> must be a matter of public knowledge.<br> What was Mr. Graham's statement?<br> Well, his exact words were:<br> "It wasn't an accident.<br> "She did it deliberately."<br> Is that correct?<br> Any more questions,|Mr. District Attorney?<br> - Not at all.|- That's all, Lieutenant.<br> Mr. Coroner,|before you conclude this hearing...<br> I'd like to recall Dr. Sherman to the stand.<br> Dr. Sherman,|will you take the stand, please?<br> Unless I'm mistaken, this is your personal|diagnosis of Mrs. Graham's illness?<br> Yes.<br> Dr. Sherman, according to the case history|you've already given the coroner...<br> Mrs. Graham was an invalid,|and likely to remain so.<br> - Yes.|- Was she depressed?<br> Well...<br> - Was Mrs. Graham depressed?|- Yes.<br> In your opinion, Doctor...<br> was she depressed enough|to commit suicide?<br> If you'll excuse me, sir,|Mr. Graham's children have just come in.<br> - Daddy.|- Wynn, my boy.<br> I didn't know you were here.|Come on out in the hall.<br> Carol, darling, I didn't expect you so soon.|You shouldn't be in here.<br> Why are all the people in there?|Where's Mother?<br> Wynn, please run along up to your room.|Carol will be up in a few minutes.<br> - All right, Daddy.|- That's a good boy.<br> - You didn't tell him, did you?|- No.<br> It's awful you had to come home|at a time like this.<br> When I phoned|I didn't intend you to bring Wynn.<br> He said suicide. Why?|I thought it was an accident.<br> I know suicide was mentioned,|but this is an inquest.<br> They have to consider everything,|every possibility.<br> But why should they talk about suicide?<br> Was Mother unhappy enough|to kill herself?<br> You know your mother was unhappy.|It was part of her illness.<br> - But, Father...|- Don't let's talk about it now.<br> I'm in the middle of this, please help me.<br> Go to your room and in a little while|I'll come up and we'll have a talk.<br> Will you do this for me, darling?<br> Oh, Daddy!<br> I know, darling.<br> Mr. Graham.<br> The coroner wants to see you.<br> Is that you, Miss Howell?<br> Miss Howell, is that you?<br> Miss Graham,|I thought I heard somebody call me.<br> Yes, I did. Is it over?<br> The inquest? Yes.<br> - What was the verdict?|- Accidental death.<br> - It wasn't an accident, I know better.|- You shouldn't think such things, really.<br> Miss Howell, my mother|mentioned you in her letters.<br> I know quite a lot about you,|probably more than you'd want me to.<br> What could she possibly say about me?<br> The last letter was written|just before the accident.<br> It was mostly about my father,|but she mentioned you.<br> How attractive you were to him.|How much he liked you.<br> I know your mother thought that,|but it's not true.<br> - My mother never lied to me.|- It isn't a question of lying or not.<br> Your mother was very ill,|much more than you were ever told.<br> - That made her imagine all kinds of things.|- There's no point in discussing it.<br> It's over now.<br> I'm home, you're leaving.<br> But your father has asked me to stay|and take care of Wynn.<br> I don't want you here,|is that plain enough?<br> Yes, that's very plain.<br> If you're trying to discharge me, don't you|think you should ask your father about it?<br> Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?<br> You're very confident|of what he would say.<br> - You're being a very silly girl.|- Am I?<br> I know how much my father likes you,|too much to let you go.<br> You've planned it that way.<br> That's so ridiculous|I won't even bother to deny it.<br> There are things about your mother|you should know.<br> Don't talk about my mother.<br> No matter how hard you scheme,|you'll never take her place.<br> I won't let you, Miss Howell.<br> If it hadn't been for you,|my mother would still be alive.<br> She killed herself because of you.<br> Carol.<br> I think you owe Miss Howell an apology.<br> You've made an extremely|offensive suggestion.<br> - You will apologize.|- No, please don't, Mr. Graham.<br> Both my children have been taught|good manners.<br> I prefer they don't forget them.<br> Carol, things haven't been pleasant here|for some time.<br> I'd looked forward to your coming home.<br> I hoped you'd make things easier|for all of us. Please don't disappoint me.<br> You don't need me, Father.|Miss Howell has taken my place.<br> Just as she took Mother's place.<br> Oh, no.<br> In the circumstances,|you'd better go back to school.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Mr. Graham, it isn't her fault.<br> I don't want you to defend me,|Miss Howell.<br> As long as you're in my father's house,|I'd rather be somewhere else.<br> Carol, your father needs you.<br> - I wish this hadn't happened.|- So do I.<br> Frightened you today, did it?<br> You remember,|the medicine made you feel better.<br> Beginning to feel it?<br> That's fine.<br> Yesterday, you told me about|Mrs. Graham dying.<br> What happened after that?<br> Washington.<br> Yes, you went there with Mr. Graham|and his son, Wynn, I gather.<br> Something happened there that upset|you very much. Made you ill.<br> Yes.<br> Made me ill, like I am now.<br> You don't forget things like that.<br> Now, why don't you tell me about it.<br> After the funeral,|we moved back to Washington.<br> I didn't want to.<br> I wasn't really needed.<br> Mr. Graham asked me to.<br> And I thought...<br> I knew I'd never see David again|if I went away.<br> So I stayed in Washington,|with the Grahams...<br> taking care of Wynn.<br> Months went by.<br> I'll race you to the top of the stairs.<br> - I'll beat you there.|- Come on.<br> - Are you ready?|- Yes.<br> - Ready, set...|- Wynn, is that you?<br> Daddy's home!<br> Hello, Son.<br> Daddy, I raced Miss Howell to the door|and I won.<br> Good for you.|Wynn, this is an old friend of mine...<br> Mr. Sutton.<br> - How do you do?|- Glad to see you again, Wynn.<br> The last time I saw you,|you weren't shaving yet.<br> It's mathematically impossible|to try a joke on a child this age.<br> I don't remember you.<br> I'm sorry to hear that,|I always try to leave a lasting impression.<br> What are these?<br> Those are the plans of a cracking plant|Mr. Sutton's building for me.<br> - You remember, you saw one once.|- Yes.<br> Miss Howell, come in.<br> - I hope we're not disturbing you.|- Not at all.<br> I brought my homework and David Sutton.<br> Hello, David, how are you?<br> No use lying to you, Louise,|you're a nurse. I'm fine.<br> - You?|- I'm fine, too.<br> - Good. Dean, you?|- Not a complaint. Not a symptom.<br> This is absolutely the healthiest circle|I've ever moved in.<br> I keep forgetting that you two|know each other.<br> Oh, yes, David and I are very old friends.<br> - Lf you're talking business, I'Il...|- No, we're all finished.<br> As a matter of fact,|I was about to propose a drink.<br> - Second the motion.|- Would you join us?<br> No, thank you. I don't think Wynn|would approve.<br> But I'll mix them for you.<br> Wynn, go upstairs|and get ready for dinner.<br> Yes, Miss Howell.<br> Daddy, you promised me|you'd read me a story.<br> - Whenever you're ready.|- All right, I'm ready.<br> Dean, I have your okay to go ahead|with this pumping station?<br> Yes. All right.<br> You're the only man|who ever worked for me...<br> who could get me to do what he wanted|and make it seem like a favor to me.<br> David, you take water in yours,|if I remember correctly?<br> Yes, please.<br> I ran a 1,000 barrels of heavy crude...<br> - The lighter stuff will go faster.|- I don't know, it's cold ground.<br> That oil comes up|as stiff as an evening shirt.<br> We'll do what we can with it.<br> - Was there much deposit in the test load?|- Here you are.<br> - Oh, thanks.|- Good.<br> Jackson put a go-devil through with it,|there was hardly any sludge at all.<br> Here's to oil, down with atomic energy.<br> Beginning to think|the atom was opened by mistake.<br> Are you going to be here long?<br> A few weeks, perhaps a month.|Depends on the boss.<br> You'd only be here a day,|if I have anything to say about it.<br> - You've been away, haven't you?|- Yes, up and away. Canada.<br> Really? I didn't know.<br> Did you like Canada?<br> Canadians are wonderful people.|It's just that they're spread so far apart...<br> at least where I was.<br> This is my first taste of civilization|in a long time.<br> I think it'll last.<br> - You sound as though it were Ionely.|- I was too busy to be Ionely.<br> I warned you to work with me,|you wouldn't like it much.<br> Mr. Graham, Wynn is ready.<br> He said you promised to read him|Bugs Bunny.<br> So I did, excuse me.<br> Don't spread this around the office...<br> but, my son's affection for me|is based on my ability to say...<br> "What's cooking, doc?"<br> I'll be back in a minute.<br> I never realized before|that Canada is so large and far away.<br> - David, it's wonderful to see you again.|- Canadian Special, good.<br> Of course, in Canada they won't drink|anything but Kentucky whiskey.<br> Aren't you going to kiss me?<br> I had no plans one way or the other.<br> All right, go ahead and kiss me.|You don't have to mean it.<br> I didn't expect you to mean it that little.<br> When a woman kisses me, Louise,|she has to take pot luck.<br> I can see that you weren't nearly as|Ionely in Canada as you pretended to be.<br> No, I wasn't.|Man, Louise, doesn't live by bread alone.<br> - Very amusing.|- No. Only mildly so.<br> You've changed, David.|Something's changed you.<br> No, we were through|before I went to Canada.<br> - I suppose I should've put that in writing.|- But, now you're hard and bitter.<br> Bored, I think would be a bit closer to it.|I warned you about that, didn't I?<br> Look, suppose we don't|discuss it anymore?<br> All right. Let's discuss something else.<br> Slide rules, cracking plants? Or maybe,|you'd rather talk about the weather?<br> It's been very nice, the weather.|We have so much of it.<br> Washington is practically all weather.|Some hot, some cold.<br> - In between, we have rain. Shall I go on?|- Please do.<br> In a moment I'll be out on the street,|hailing a cab.<br> I hope I haven't said anything offensive,|I wouldn't want to hurt you.<br> Usually, one of the nice things|about going away, is coming back.<br> Usually, not always.<br> Did you expect to come back and find|me just as you left me, waiting patiently?<br> Crying a little with the joy|of seeing you again?<br> You're so sure of yourself,|so certain of your own breathless charm!<br> I'm sorry, Louise.<br> You watch temperatures go down|and then go up again...<br> but in love, there are no relapses.<br> Once you're out of it, the fever never|comes back again. Bye, Louise.<br> Your love affair with yourself|has reached heroic proportions.<br> Doesn't leave much room for me.<br> Are you sure you can get along without|somebody to help you admire yourself?<br> You're offering me no more|than any other registered nurse.<br> Louise, be reasonable.<br> That's fairly reasonable.<br> David, leaving already?<br> Yes, I have a dinner date.|You know how it is.<br> Don't come in with a hangover tomorrow.<br> Don't go, Miss Howell.<br> I was just going out to get some fresh air.<br> Sutton's a good fellow.|I'm glad I've got him.<br> He's doing very well.<br> This is my last day here, Mr. Graham.|I'm leaving.<br> I don't understand.<br> - It's simple. I'm quitting.|- Are you unhappy here?<br> I'd rather not discuss it.<br> - I won't permit it.|- I'm afraid you'll have to.<br> I know people usually|do what you want, Mr. Graham...<br> if they won't,|you have ways of persuading them.<br> But don't try that with me,|because it won't work.<br> I've never seen you like this before.<br> - You're usually so quiet.|- Yes, quiet, patient, efficient Miss Howell.<br> Tell her to do something and she does it,|day after day, year after year.<br> At the age of 60, retires with a gold watch|and the blessings of the entire household.<br> No, thank you. I've had enough|of being a servant.<br> I've never thought of you as a servant.|I've never...<br> - You've been very kind, but I'm leaving.|- Don't go, please.<br> Something's upset you. I don't know|what it is, but I'm deeply concerned.<br> You're right, I do try to get what I want|whenever possible.<br> That may seem selfish, I suppose it is.<br> But you've become very necessary here.<br> You're a part of my home.|Very much a part of my life.<br> I don't know how to express|this properly...<br> but I've become very fond of you.<br> Fond is an understatement.<br> - Mr. Graham, don't...|- I hadn't meant to talk of this for a while...<br> but now it seems necessary.<br> I'm asking you to marry me.<br> I hadn't intended to amuse you.<br> It wasn't you. It was something else,|please believe me.<br> I had to either laugh or cry.<br> I'm through with crying,|don't you understand that?<br> No, but it's all right.<br> As for marrying you...<br> it's very flattering.<br> It feels wonderful to be wanted|by someone.<br> I needed that feeling right now,|more than you'll ever know.<br> Something happens to a|woman when she isn't wanted.<br> - Something dreadful.|- All of which doesn't answer my question.<br> Will you marry me?<br> I'm aging visibly.<br> I'm not in love with you.<br> Do you think we could be happy?<br> I'll do everything in my power|to see that you are.<br> There's Carol to think of.|She doesn't like me.<br> I haven't done this very gracefully|or even adequately.<br> But, one thing is certain,|Carol isn't asking to marry you, I am.<br> I've never had a great deal.<br> It's very tempting to be offered|the kind of life I'd have as your wife.<br> But that's not important.<br> The important thing is|I think I can make you happy.<br> I will marry you, if you want me to.<br> I'm sorry, I'm just not quite|used to the idea, yet.<br> It isn't very easy for a man my age|to kiss a woman with dignity.<br> I'll need practice.<br> Will you have dinner with me, Louise?<br> Yes, Dean.<br> Don't you love the way|Prof. Hopkins gets mad?<br> - I just think he's delicious, don't you?|- Well...<br> - Do you like Mr. Elliott?|- Sort of.<br> I can't stand him.|Know what he said to me?<br> You'll never believe it.|He said I talk too much.<br> I wonder where he got that idea.<br> Hey, Graham, you have a visitor.<br> - A man?|- No, a lady.<br> - Thank you.|- Bye.<br> - Hello.|- Yes?<br> I came to see you.<br> Obviously.<br> That's a very pretty sweater you have on.<br> You didn't drive 300 miles|just to admire my sweater.<br> No, I didn't.<br> I came to tell you something.<br> Father called me.|You're going to be married.<br> I'm sorry he told you. I wanted to.<br> Is that all?<br> I want you to like me.<br> I don't think that's absolutely necessary,|Miss Howell.<br> I hope you won't mind|if I don't call you mother.<br> That's beside the point.<br> I do think that we should talk|about your mother, just a little.<br> I know what you're going to say.<br> I talked to Dr. Sherman.|He told me things I hadn't known.<br> I know what I thought about|you and Father wasn't true.<br> And I'm sorry I said the things I did.|I'm very sorry.<br> It's all right. I didn't blame you.<br> As for your getting married...<br> you and Father are quite capable|of deciding things for yourself.<br> - It isn't necessary to have my approval.|- Oh, but it is.<br> Your father is very Ionely, Carol.<br> Maybe that has something to do with|his wanting to marry me, I don't know.<br> I do know that I can't marry him,|if it would mean his losing you.<br> Since there's no hope you'll like me,|I'll do what you want me to do.<br> I'll go away.<br> - He'd never forgive me.|- He won't know I've talked to you.<br> - I'm sorry.|- That's all right.<br> You can't help the way you feel,|any more than I can.<br> Your father needs someone, Carol,|and he has for a long time.<br> You've stayed away all these weeks just|to punish him for making you unhappy.<br> You don't know the meaning|of unhappiness.<br> If you ever really want to know,|ask your father.<br> You know,|we could've been friends very easily.<br> If we'd met a few days sooner,|or a long time later.<br> It's too bad.<br> Miss Howell...<br> Louise.<br> - Good afternoon, Mr. Sutton.|- Good afternoon.<br> How late am I?<br> I'm afraid you've missed|the entire ceremony.<br> Frankly, I just came for the food and drink.<br> Where are they?<br> Mr. And Mrs. Graham|are in the drawing room.<br> I mean the food and drink.|Never mind, I'll find them myself.<br> - How are you, David?|- Hello, George.<br> - I wish you both a lot of happiness.|- Thank you very much.<br> I wonder if I'd start a new trend|if I shook hands with the bride...<br> and embraced the groom?<br> I know it's tough,|but couldn't you try to be conventional?<br> You're a very lucky man.<br> - You're a very lucky woman.|- Thank you, David.<br> Bless you both,|and where are the hors d'oeuvres?<br> Dean, I didn't know you'd invited him.<br> - I didn't. Didn't you?|- No.<br> One more, please.<br> Come out from behind that potted palm.<br> No.<br> Would you rather I hid|and you came out and found me?<br> I'll be through crying in a minute.|Please go away.<br> I will not. I'm hungry. You cry, I'll eat.<br> Don't mind me. Blow as hard as you like.<br> There's nothing unusual|about crying at a wedding.<br> Certainly not,|I've got a lump in my throat myself.<br> Mine's pure emotion.|Yours is devilled egg.<br> I was afraid you were going to ruin|a perfectly good potted palm.<br> It wouldn't matter.<br> - They're not ours, they're rented.|- Don't worry about it.<br> - What?|- You're David Sutton.<br> I've never denied that, who are you?<br> Don't you remember me?|Don't you recognize me?<br> Not with your eyes in that condition, no.<br> The last time you saw me,|my eyes were in exactly this condition.<br> I was 11 years old|and I'd just proposed marriage to you.<br> Now, do you know?<br> Not definitely. I received proposals|from several 11-year-olds.<br> Will this help?<br> When you said no, I hauled off|and kicked you in the shins.<br> Carol Graham!<br> I'm disappointed, I'd pictured you|going through life with a limp.<br> Let me look at you.<br> Well, you haven't grown very much but...<br> then again, you have.<br> Let me look at you.<br> You're holding your stomach in a bit,|otherwise you've held together beautifully.<br> - Yes, very attractive.|- Thank you.<br> Why don't we see if the minister|is still here? A double wedding.<br> I don't want my shins kicked again.<br> But, I won't be rushed|into anything, either.<br> I'm going to give you plenty of time.<br> You're gonna take me dining,|dancing, nightclubbing...<br> That sounds like an expensive program.<br> You better speak to your father|about raising your allowance.<br> Carol, your father wants you.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Wine?<br> Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Stay away from Carol.<br> - Why?|- Because you're not wanted in this house.<br> I'm married now and I have a different life.<br> Frankly, you bring back|very unpleasant memories.<br> I've forgiven you,|why haven't you forgiven me?<br> Do I have to make a scene|before you leave?<br> No, I arrived late,|it's only right that I should leave early.<br> - Hello, Louise.|- Hello, John.<br> Where's Dean?|Is he neglecting you already?<br> - Yes. For a new oil field.|- That's hardly a good excuse.<br> There's David Sutton.<br> That's very rude.|He'll think you're inviting him over here.<br> I am.<br> I've hooked him.<br> I wish you hadn't done that.<br> I don't want him to join us.<br> When he comes over, make an excuse,|but get rid of him.<br> - Why?|- Because I asked you to.<br> - Hello, Carol.|- Hello, David.<br> - Mrs. Graham, how are you?|- Very well, thank you.<br> We don't want to keep you|from your friends.<br> Yes, we do.<br> As a matter of fact,|I haven't a friend in the world.<br> I guess, I better be|getting back to my seat.<br> Too late, you're trapped.<br> In that case I'll take the best spot.|Move over.<br> Darling, I have a headache,|I think I'd better go home.<br> Should I go with you?<br> No, you stay. I don't want to spoil|the concert for you.<br> I'll see her to the car.<br> You're using the wrong tactics,|you should keep me guessing.<br> I don't know why I don't hate you.<br> You don't try hard enough.|You should force yourself.<br> Someday you're going to stop|laughing at me.<br> - May I see you to the car?|- No, thank you. Don't bother.<br> Good night, Mrs. Graham.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Graham.<br> Oh, Elsie.<br> - Is my husband home?|- No, ma'am.<br> He phoned from the office.|He said he'd be late.<br> What is it?<br> - We fooled her, didn't we?|- Yes.<br> - Good night.|- Good night, darling.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> Carol.<br> - I thought you were ill.|- Never mind that.<br> - I want to talk to you.|- About?<br> - Not here, in my room.|- We can talk here.<br> Get in there, I said.<br> I don't like this kind of treatment.<br> I saw you kissing.<br> - What of it?|- I heard what you said to him.<br> - Did you?|- Stay away from him, Carol. He's no good.<br> Odd, he says that about you.<br> We had quite a long talk about you.<br> - He's a liar, whatever he said was a lie.|- Really?<br> Even what he told me|about how you used to meet in his cabin?<br> Lies, all lies.<br> I'd never have anything to do with him,|that's why he hates me.<br> He doesn't hate you.|But he doesn't love you, either.<br> You're the one,|you're in love with him, aren't you?<br> That's absurd and ridiculous.|Childish, just like everything else.<br> - Pretty stupid of you to have believed him.|- He told me other things I hadn't known.<br> About my mother.<br> What about her?<br> What about your mother, what did he say?<br> You killed her, it wasn't an accident.<br> - Keep quiet!|- You did it so you could marry my father.<br> - So David would come back...|- That's not true, you're lying.<br> You're all liars.<br> You're in love with David,|and you killed my mother to get him back!<br> It's true, isn't it? Isn't it true, Louise?<br> - Isn't it?|- Yes, it's true!<br> Now leave me alone.<br> - What are you going to do?|- I'm going to tell my father, right now.<br> Don't do that, Carol, I'm warning you.<br> Carol!<br> I won't let you tell him.<br> - You can't stop me.|- Yes, I can.<br> Let me go, I'm going to tell him.<br> Good night.<br> Louise, you shouldn't have waited up.|Are you feeling better?<br> - Yes.|- I came straight home as I was worried.<br> It's a shame you missed the concert.<br> - Your jacket is wet.|- It doesn't matter.<br> - Is there something I can do for you?|- No.<br> Good night.<br> All right...<br> you can finish dressing now, Mrs...<br> Mrs. Smith.<br> Oh, yes. Smith.<br> Unusual name.<br> Come in here, when you're ready.<br> Who did she say recommended her?<br> Dr. Reynolds in Washington.|Shall I look him up?<br> Don't bother,|I doubt there is such a doctor.<br> In any case, it doesn't matter.|I know all that I need to know.<br> Did she mention|any previous medical history?<br> Measles, influenza, the usual things.|No serious illnesses.<br> Perhaps that much is true.<br> Sit down, please.<br> - You think I've been lying to you?|- I'm sure of it.<br> People named Smith rarely|have the letters "L.G." on their clothing.<br> - I'm sorry.|- That's not important.<br> It merely makes it a little more difficult|for me to help you.<br> And you do need help. Take this.<br> Incoordination.|Now close your eyes, please.<br> Hold out your hand.<br> What does that feel like to you?<br> A piece of cloth.<br> Now the other hand.<br> That doesn't feel like a piece of cloth,|does it?<br> - No, it doesn't.|- What does it feel like?<br> I don't know.<br> A piece of sandpaper, perhaps?<br> Yes, that's it.<br> Open your eyes.<br> Extreme suggestibility.<br> And that pounding noise|you hear at night...<br> that's easily explained, Mrs. Smith.<br> It's merely the sound|of your own heart beating.<br> Blood pulsation can be heard as sound.<br> It's a common symptom of neurasthenia.<br> What's wrong with me, Doctor?<br> Why do I see things that aren't...<br> that just couldn't be real?<br> Sometimes a patient can't distinguish|between reality and unreality.<br> In your case,|you're still able to make that distinction.<br> But what if it gets worse? What then?<br> There is a type of nervous disorder|in which that happens.<br> We all have dreams, Mrs. Smith.|Bad dreams, sometimes.<br> But we wake up|and we say that was a bad dream.<br> Occasionally, however,|we find a patient who can't wake up.<br> He or she lacks insight...<br> the ability to distinguish|between what is real and what isn't.<br> Now, that may be true in your case.<br> It's too early to know definitely.<br> You're describing schizophrenia,|aren't you?<br> Is that what's wrong with me?<br> I didn't know you had any knowledge|of the subject...<br> or I shouldn't have discussed it.<br> I knew there was something wrong|with me when I came up here.<br> I had no idea it was insanity.<br> Insanity's not a word we like to use,|Mrs. Smith.<br> You have a problem but it's not insoluble.<br> Problems never are.<br> Whatever it is that's troubling you,|put an end to it.<br> No, it's too late.<br> - Much too late.|- Nonsense.<br> The important thing is to know|that there is something wrong.<br> Now that you know,|you can do something about it.<br> I'm going to give you|the name of a psychiatrist.<br> Go and see him.<br> Don't lie to him as you did to me.|Tell him the truth.<br> Mrs. Smith?<br> Well, I'll have to come up then.<br> I'll fly at the end of the week.<br> Very well. See you then.<br> Darling, I have to go to Canada.<br> Just for a few days.|Why don't you sit down?<br> I've got an idea. Why don't you come|with me? Make it a holiday.<br> Might get some fishing in.<br> I'll teach you how to get|a 40-pound salmon.<br> I'm leaving you.<br> I'm going away. I don't know where.|That isn't important.<br> - The important thing is, I want a divorce.|- I don't...<br> I won't discuss it.|There's nothing to discuss.<br> You don't know what you're saying.<br> Why should you want a divorce?|What have I done?<br> I thought I'd given you|everything you wanted.<br> I hoped that you'd be happy with me.|I thought you were.<br> It isn't you.<br> Whatever's wrong with our marriage|is my fault.<br> Louise, what's troubling you?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> But it just won't work out.<br> I can't take her place. I've tried but...<br> - she hates me for it.|- Who hates you?<br> - Pauline.|- Pauline?<br> Yes.<br> I can't seem to forget her.<br> - Don't you see, I've got to go away.|- Stop it.<br> You talk as if she were alive.<br> Yes, I did, didn't I? I didn't mean to.<br> She isn't alive, I know that.<br> I'm sorry, we've never|discussed Pauline before.<br> But whatever problems I had...<br> all the unpleasant memories...<br> I put them aside when we were married.|They were over for me.<br> Not for you, I gather.<br> Well, I'll fix that.<br> I don't intend to lose you so easily.<br> Have my car brought around|to the side entrance.<br> Telephone the house|and tell Elsie to pack some things...<br> for Mrs. Graham and myself.|We'll be out till Monday.<br> Yes, sir. Where can we reach you?<br> - I don't want to be reached.|- Yes, sir.<br> I love you very much.<br> Your happiness means everything to me.<br> I'm going to help you forget Pauline|just as I've forgotten.<br> You're going away with me.<br> - Where?|- To the lake house.<br> Oh, no, I'm afraid of her!<br> Pauline is gone from our lives.|She can't harm us...<br> or take you away from me.<br> You'll see.<br> There's only one way to solve a problem.<br> And that's to face it.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Graham.<br> Mr. Graham.<br> Good evening, Norris.<br> Dreadful weather.<br> - The place looks in good order.|- Thanks.<br> Almost thought we'd lose the house|a while back.<br> What happened?<br> - Fire.|- Much damage?<br> Burned quite a few trees.|I want to talk to you about that...<br> they'll blow down this winter anyway.|My advice, cut them.<br> You think any of them can be saved?<br> Pretty bad shape. Would you like to look...<br> before it gets dark?|You can see from over here.<br> - Go ahead, darling.|- All right.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Graham.<br> - You're the caretaker's wife.|- I'm Mrs. Norris.<br> I saw you come in from upstairs.|I was airing out the rooms.<br> I'm sorry we didn't know|you were coming sooner.<br> I'd have fixed the place up a little.<br> - That's quite all right.|- Mr. Norris was sick last week.<br> That's why everything is so dusty.<br> You'd be surprised|how a place can run down so fast.<br> It doesn't seem to take any time at all.<br> Yes, I know.<br> You look cold.|I'll go and make you a cup of tea.<br> No. Please don't bother.<br> No bother. You stay by the fire.|It won't take me a minute.<br> Getting on to winter again.<br> What is it!<br> No.<br> No, I won't.<br> I won't.<br> Louise, what is it?<br> Why did you scream?<br> It's Pauline.<br> She wants me to kill myself, like she did.<br> She wants me to drown, but I won't.<br> Pauline is dead.<br> - She's been dead over a year.|- No, she's there.<br> Now, she's talking to me again.<br> Hear her? Listen.<br> "Kill yourself, Louise.<br> "Drown yourself in the lake."<br> Make her stop.<br> I tell you, she's dead. There's no one there.<br> Look, there's no one there.<br> Gone?<br> She's gone.<br> She was never there.<br> She went back to the lake.<br> She'll wait for me there.<br> Yes, she'll wait for me.|She said she would.<br> What do you mean?|What on Earth do you mean?<br> Come out of this room.<br> Come out.<br> I don't know.<br> I just don't understand.<br> - What happened?|- You had a bad dream.<br> About Pauline.<br> Oh, yes, now I remember.<br> I thought she was alive. She spoke to me.<br> - It wasn't real?|- Of course, it wasn't.<br> I can't tell anymore.<br> I don't seem to know the difference.<br> Stay near.<br> Stay close to me.<br> I'm afraid.<br> I'm afraid of Pauline.<br> Why? What reason|have you to be afraid of her?<br> You don't know.<br> You don't know what I've done.<br> Tell me.<br> But I can't hear you.<br> I said, I killed her.|I helped her commit suicide.<br> - That's not true.|- Yes, it is.<br> She asked me to take her down|to the rock.<br> I helped her. It was very dark.<br> Then she went close to the edge of it.<br> I watched her.<br> I stood there and watched her.<br> Then she came up.<br> Her face was white through the water|and then...<br> she called to me.<br> "Louise, Louise."<br> Then she stopped.<br> But I could still hear her.<br> And I hear her now: "Louise, Louise."<br> Stop it.<br> Listen to me.<br> This is all nonsense.|I don't know why you think these things.<br> It's something for a doctor to find out.|But none of it's true.<br> - Yes, it is.|- It's not true, I tell you.<br> I know what happened that night.<br> And you had nothing to do with it.|You weren't even there.<br> Pauline and I were together on the rock.<br> She said she was cold.|I went to the house for a wrap.<br> I was only away a few moments,|but when I came back she was gone.<br> The rest, you know.|You were nowhere near that night.<br> You were in the village.|Don't you remember?<br> I was in the village.<br> - It was my day off.|- Yes.<br> You're not just lying|to make things right for me?<br> You wouldn't lie to me about a thing|like that, would you?<br> No, you only imagined it.<br> I only imagined it.<br> I didn't kill her.<br> And I didn't help her kill herself.<br> I had nothing to do with it.<br> Thank you.<br> For nearly a year now|I've been thinking all kinds of things.<br> Why didn't you tell me before?|I could've helped you.<br> I couldn't.<br> I was even afraid|to close my eyes at night.<br> But it's all right now.|It's all right. She's gone.<br> Pauline's gone and she'll never come back.|No, she'll never come back.<br> Good evening, Elsie.<br> - Good evening, Elsie.|- Good evening, sir.<br> The rest of the luggage is in the car.<br> Will you ask Edwards|to bring it in, please?<br> You're beautiful.<br> - Women always are when they're happy.|- Are you happy?<br> I've never felt so happy.<br> I feel as though I were floating|two or three inches off the floor.<br> There's only one thing wrong with it.<br> - What's that?|- Makes me hungry.<br> Elsie, we're starving.|I suppose it's too late for dinner.<br> - Yes, sir, but I could fix you something.|- No.<br> I'll tell you what. Let's go out.|Let's make it a real evening.<br> - Nightclub, champagne, dancing.|- Dancing? I'd love it.<br> - How long will it take you to dress?|- Five minutes.<br> All right then, an hour-and-a-half.<br> The polka has come a long way|since my time.<br> Something new has been added.<br> Nonsense, we're the best couple|on the floor.<br> We must be. There's a waiter watching us|and taking notes.<br> - Lf we're not the best, we're the happiest.|- I hope none of my stockholders are here.<br> Tommy, you may take a short rest|and then start mixing me another.<br> - Yes, sir.|- Hello.<br> I'm not late, am I?<br> No. I just came early|so I could get in a few practice swings.<br> Any other boyfriend would've|picked me up and brought me here.<br> That is exactly why I didn't.<br> And to think I'd live to see the day|when I'd be referred to as a boyfriend.<br> Tommy, you better make|that next one a double.<br> And the young lady|will have a bourbon and ginger ale.<br> Without the bourbon.<br> How many have you had?<br> Easily.<br> Aren't you overdoing it?|How about your insides?<br> My liver rushes in|where angels fear to tread.<br> - I worry about you, David.|- Thank you very much.<br> How do you like my dress?<br> Construction engineers|do not comment on ladies' dresses.<br> Sometimes it's not your liver|I worry about, it's your mind.<br> Thank you again.<br> Carol, you're very young, you're very|beautiful. I love you very much.<br> How American it is|to want something better.<br> Look, Carol...<br> in another few days|I've got to be going on back to Canada.<br> What's gonna happen between us?<br> Well, I don't know about you.<br> But I've considered us engaged|for quite some time.<br> So have I, but that's a nasty way|for an engagement to end...<br> in a marriage.<br> David, do you think we have a chance?<br> Do you think it would last?<br> I think it would last|a reasonable length of time.<br> Enough to make it worth|the minister's while, anyway.<br> David, don't you think we|need each other?<br> We wouldn't know that|until after we're married.<br> Isn't that putting the cart|before the horse?<br> Now look, if you're gonna drag horses|into this conversation, we're lost.<br> Anyway, look at the difference in our ages.<br> What of it?<br> You're 35, I'm 20.<br> After one year of married life with you,|I'll look...<br> You know, come to think of it,|that is a very attractive dress.<br> It's Dad and Louise.<br> Carol and David.<br> - Don't.|- What's the matter?<br> Your father will probably|want us to join them.<br> Don't you want to?<br> - I'd rather not. Louise.|- She wouldn't mind.<br> She doesn't really dislike you.<br> Beg your pardon, sir.<br> The gentleman at that table would like|to have you join them.<br> Okay.<br> - I thought you were up at the lake house.|- We came back early.<br> How are you, Mrs. Graham?<br> Why haven't you got|your nose to the grindstone?<br> Your daughter asked me out tonight.|I'm billing you for it later.<br> Chivalry is dead.<br> You seem to be enjoying|your stay in Washington.<br> Bring another bottle of this|and two more glasses.<br> You're old enough to drink champagne.<br> - Glad to hear it.|- You mustn't let Dean work you too hard.<br> We haven't seen enough of you|since you got back.<br> - I've been very busy.|- There, you see?<br> Mr. Sutton does work too hard.|Look how pale he is, and how quiet.<br> He never used to be so quiet.<br> Is he always this quiet|when he's with you?<br> Does he talk to you?|He's a beautiful conversationalist...<br> when he wants to be.|Get him to confide in you.<br> - I try...|- There might be one or two things...<br> that he wouldn't want us|to know about him.<br> - He looks like a man with a past.|- Most of us do.<br> However, we don't consider|such things important.<br> Besides, anything can be forgiven a man|who plays the piano as well as he does.<br> Have you ever heard him play|the piano, Carol? He's excellent.<br> With the proper training he could|have become a concert pianist.<br> But he wouldn't practice enough.<br> And he had|the most unfortunate habit of...<br> stopping right in the middle|of his selection.<br> Come in.<br> - Do you have any orange sticks?|- Yes.<br> In my bed table drawer.<br> I don't know what I do with mine. Thanks.<br> Stay and talk to me.<br> All right.<br> I didn't know that you and Mr. Sutton|were such good friends.<br> Why don't you call him David?<br> You might as well,|you'll be seeing a lot of him from now on.<br> Do you like David?<br> How does he feel about you?<br> About the same, I guess.<br> How do you know?<br> I can tell by the way he breathes|when I go near him. You know.<br> Tell me frankly.<br> Do you think I'm as attractive|as David says?<br> You're very pretty.<br> And wealthy.<br> Both of which would appeal to David.|Particularly the money.<br> Don't you like David?<br> No.<br> As a matter of fact, I dislike him intensely.<br> For a very good reason.<br> - Why? He's never done anything...|- Look.<br> I've never asked you this before.<br> But it's very important now.<br> Do you trust me, Carol?<br> I don't know. I've never thought about it.<br> I suppose I do, why?<br> I've wanted to tell you this so many times|but I never could bring myself to do it.<br> And when it became obvious|that you liked David so much...<br> it was too late.<br> Can't you see what he's like?<br> Don't take him so seriously.<br> I know something about him|you don't know.<br> Something that would make everything|he's probably said to you a lie.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I wasn't going to tell you this.<br> I thought you'd get over it|or realize what he's like.<br> But since you haven't, I'll tell you.|He's in love with someone else.<br> - What?|- You saw how he was tonight.<br> He's not in love with you, Carol.|Believe me, it's someone else.<br> You talk as though it were you.<br> Yes.<br> He uses you as an excuse|to come here to see me.<br> - I don't believe it.|- I begged him not to hurt you.<br> And I couldn't tell your father.|He likes David so much.<br> It's better to find out now how he is|and be hurt a little than find out...<br> - about it later and be destroyed by it.|- I don't believe it. I'll talk to him.<br> - Don't be a fool. He'll only lie to you again.|- Let me go.<br> - Hello, Elsie.|- Good afternoon, Mr. Sutton.<br> - Mrs. Graham home?|- Just a moment and I'll see.<br> - Won't you sit down?|- Thanks.<br> - Mr. Sutton is calling.|- Tell him I'm not home.<br> Don't bother, Elsie, I'll tell him myself.<br> - He must have followed me.|- It's all right. You can go.<br> What do you want?<br> I've just been to see Dean.|What did you say to him?<br> - About what?|- What did you tell him?<br> I told him you want to marry Carol.<br> - That's the truth, isn't it?|- What else did you say to him?<br> - Nothing.|- Don't lie to me, Louise.<br> You probably told him the same pack|of stupid lies about me...<br> that you tried to pawn off|on Carol last night.<br> She told me about that.|That must've been charming.<br> You said once|that I'd changed, remember?<br> Well, you've changed, too.|You didn't used to be a liar.<br> It wasn't me. I didn't tell him anything.|It was Carol.<br> She doesn't love you, David.|She's tired and wants to be rid of you.<br> So she told Dean.<br> - What's the matter? Don't you believe me?|- No.<br> All right. I lied to him.<br> It was easy.<br> He believed me, too.<br> What're you going to do about it?<br> Something I should have done|a long time ago.<br> Something very naive and simple.<br> But it'll probably impress you|as being diabolical.<br> I'm going to tell him the truth.<br> About us, and more particularly,|about you.<br> He won't believe you.<br> You can be as agreeable and charming|as you like.<br> It won't do you any good.<br> - He'll always hate you.|- Not me darling, you.<br> But I just can't quite figure out why you|started spinning this web of deception.<br> I told you once, I'd do anything to keep|you from leaving me, and I will.<br> - Anything.|- Well.<br> Any jailbreak is pretty tough,|but I think I can manage this one.<br> You'll see.<br> I can be very objectionable.<br> That, I can believe.<br> But you're forgetting just one thing.<br> Carol.<br> What about her?<br> She loves me enough to marry me|no matter what you do.<br> And I love her.<br> Her or her money?<br> Well, you have a point there.|Her money is an obstacle.<br> So I intend spending it|just as rapidly as possible.<br> - Good evening, sir.|- Good evening, Elsie.<br> - Where's Mrs. Graham?|- In her room.<br> I don't know whether I should mention it.|She's been crying all afternoon.<br> Thank you.<br> David came back to see me this afternoon.<br> And Carol, too. We had a long talk.<br> Why did you lie to me?<br> Because I felt like it.<br> I wanted to lie and I lied.<br> Let me alone.<br> You've been crying.|Elsie told me you've been crying...<br> Let me alone.<br> I want to think.<br> I don't know what to do,|I want to think and people won't let me.<br> I don't feel well.<br> I know you don't feel well.|I've known it for some time.<br> I thought perhaps,|things would work themselves out.<br> But now I'm not so sure.<br> That's why I've asked a doctor|to come and see you.<br> A doctor?<br> You went to the trouble|of getting me a doctor?<br> That's very thoughtful of you.<br> You're very sweet and kind.<br> - He's an old friend of mine.|- What kind of a doctor?<br> He'll be able to help you.<br> - He'll know exactly what to do.|- What kind of a doctor?<br> Don't you think I know?<br> I've been lying here all afternoon|waiting for you to come home...<br> knowing what you'd say|when you came in.<br> "Louise I've asked a doctor|to come and see you."<br> Knowing what kind of a doctor|it would be, too.<br> You think there's something wrong|with my mind, don't you?<br> - This man is a mental specialist, but...|- No, I won't see him.<br> Listen to me.<br> No, you just want to lock me up,|put me away, I know.<br> - I'm trying to help you.|- No, you're not.<br> You're trying to get rid of me.<br> That's why you're calling in a doctor,|isn't it?<br> I love you. I want you to be well again.<br> And you need help.|That's all I'm trying to do.<br> I only want to help you.<br> If only you could.<br> I don't know what's wrong.<br> I don't know why I'm this way.<br> - Lf you see this doctor...|- No.<br> Listen to me,|I've only asked him to talk to you.<br> - When's he coming?|- He's coming to dinner.<br> It'll be very quiet and we can talk.<br> All right.<br> I'll do what you say. Anything.<br> You'll see.<br> I won't do anything bad.|I just want to please you.<br> So I'll do whatever you say.<br> Now, can I be alone?|I'd like to lie down for a while...<br> so I'll be rested when the doctor comes.<br> That's better.|I'm so glad you feel this way.<br> I know everything is going to be all right.<br> Rest yourself, darling, and I'll call you.<br> Well, I won't ask you to sit down.|What do you want?<br> I had to see you.<br> - I had to talk to you about us.|- "Us" is not my favorite topic.<br> - Name another.|- All right, me.<br> - There are some things you must know.|- It won't do any good.<br> Will you get out, go home, leave me alone.<br> David.<br> I'm sorry, Louise, I seldom hit a woman.<br> But if you don't leave me alone|I'll wind up kicking babies.<br> It's all right. It didn't hurt.<br> David, I'm ill. Very ill.<br> Why come to me? All I can recommend|is a couple of aspirins.<br> But you've got to listen.<br> I've done some terrible things|because of you.<br> I'm rotting away with the things I've done.<br> - The things you've...|- All I've done is fall out of love with you.<br> That's a man's privilege.<br> I wish sometimes women would avail|themselves of the same privilege.<br> I made Dean love me.<br> It was easy because he was so Ionely.<br> I thought if I were married to a rich man|I could make you come back to me.<br> But now it's all over.<br> - I've lost you and now I've lost Dean.|- You haven't lost Dean.<br> He wants to help and I know he loves you,|he told me that this afternoon.<br> No, he doesn't.<br> He wants to put me away in an institution|and I'd never see you again.<br> Talk to him, David.|Make him leave me alone.<br> Don't let him do it, I'm not insane.<br> - What do you mean?|- He thinks I am.<br> I don't know what this is all about,|Louise, but...<br> there's one thing I'm sure of:<br> Dean wouldn't do anything to hurt you.<br> Now why don't you let me take you home?<br> No.<br> - I think I'd better call Dean.|- But I don't want you to.<br> He'll take care of you. He'll look after you|a lot better than I ever could.<br> He only wants to get rid of me.<br> And you're helping him.|You're against me, too.<br> Both of you and Carol.|You're all against me!<br> Going away?<br> Yes. Carol and I are|getting married tonight.<br> No, you're not.<br> You're not going to marry her.|You're not good enough for her.<br> If you're going to shoot me,|at least be honest about it.<br> You don't give a hoot about Carol|and you never have.<br> I'd rather be shot by a jealous woman|than a noble one, anyway.<br> Don't you think we should sit down quietly|and think up...<br> a better reason for you to shoot me|than that?<br> Talking won't do you any good.<br> It's silly of you to kill me, Louise.<br> There's still a lot of pain|and unhappiness in store for me.<br> You wouldn't want me to miss all that,|now would you?<br> Now, look, why don't you just|give me that before I get hurt.<br> I told you.<br> I explained it to you, how important|it was for you not to leave me again.<br> All right.<br> Well, go ahead and shoot.<br> Mathematically, the chances|of your hitting me are slight.<br> And as far as killing me, well,|I don't think you're that good a shot.<br> I killed him!<br> Ten years ago, I could've prevented this.<br> Five, even two years ago,|it could've been prevented.<br> It was there for any psychiatrist to see.<br> If a child breaks a leg,|he's taken to a doctor.<br> If he shows signs of mental illness,|he's hidden away in a closet.<br> - Shut away, until it's too late.|- Dr. Willard, a Mr. Graham...<br> is waiting in your office to see you.<br> All right. Thanks, Miss Pullie.<br> - Dr. Willard.|- Yes, sir.<br> My name is Dean Graham.<br> - You telegraphed me about my wife.|- Yes, how do you do?<br> Won't you sit down, please?<br> Doctor, I've never given way to emotion.<br> But you can imagine my state of mind.<br> Yes, of course I can.<br> May I see her?<br> Yes.<br> She won't recognize you though.<br> I must know her condition, Doctor.|Tell me everything you know.<br> Mr. Graham, it's a clear case of psychosis.<br> - Completely unbalanced.|- You mean she's insane.<br> Yes, if you insist on using that term.<br> - Is it hopeless?|- No, it isn't.<br> As a matter of fact,|I intend to try and restore her.<br> It will take many months.<br> But there's every reason to believe|that someday she'll be herself.<br> Thank God.<br> Mr. Graham, I want you to follow me|very closely now.<br> We human beings act according|to certain patterns of behavior.<br> Sometimes,|why exactly we don't know yet...<br> the pattern is broken.<br> The wires are crossed.<br> The mind cannot evaluate, judge...<br> or even function properly.<br> Shock follows shock,|until eventually the mind gives way.<br> The brain loses control|and the body sinks into coma.<br> Then, in a biblical sense...<br> we might say that such a person|is possessed of devils.<br> And, it is the psychiatrist|that must cast them out.<br> Substantially...<br> this is what happened to Louise.<br> She was under great emotional strain|the night your first wife killed herself.<br> And it was a very simple matter|for her tortured mind...<br> to develop the delusion that she actually|helped Pauline to commit suicide.<br> And once the initial delusion|was established...<br> her present condition|was almost inevitable.<br> I see.<br> Doctor.<br> Since, apparently,|she has told you all this...<br> I presume you know|about David Sutton, too.<br> Yes, Mr. Graham, I do.<br> - There'll be a trial, of course.|- Of course.<br> I can't predict the outcome.<br> But Louise is neither mentally nor morally|responsible for any of her actions.<br> Whether or not a jury will understand that|is beyond my control.<br> And now, may I see her?<br> Yes, Mr. Graham, come with me.<br> She looks almost happy.<br> Yes, she is, in a way.<br> There are no problems|in her private world.<br> Not now, anyway.<br> When she starts to recover...<br> She'll suffer, I suppose.<br> You and I can have no conception|of how she'll suffer.<br> - I'd like to spare her that.|- You can't.<br> It's pain that made her this way.<br> Only through greater pain,|and suffering beyond belief...<br> will she get well again.<br> I'll be there whatever happens.<br> However much she suffers.<br> I was rather hoping you'd say that.<br> She's going to need you,|very much indeed.<br> - Can I stay here a few moments?|- Yes, of course.<br> If she awakens,|don't expect too much, though.<br> She won't know you. Not for a while.<br> I'll wait.<br> I'm here.<br>
