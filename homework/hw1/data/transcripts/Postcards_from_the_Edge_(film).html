Is this some kind<br> of Candid Camera thing?<br> - Where's the camera?<br> - Shut up.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Did you think we don't know about your<br> affair with a government official?<br> We know who you are...<br> ...Miss Porter.<br> We are not fools.<br> Fools, no.<br> You wish you were foolish.<br> Foolish should be a goal of yours.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> Don't you get tired of acting like<br> a typical South American police thug?<br> Go ahead, hit me again.<br> I tell you, our side will always win.<br> We have more spirit<br> and resources than you.<br> All it'll cost us is money.<br> There isn't enough mommy in the world<br> to further your cause.<br> Fuck.<br> Will you shut up, Raoul?<br> You'd want your mommy too,<br> if you had to say all this.<br> - Cut!<br> - Oh, Lowell, I'm sorry.<br> End marker.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, Lowell.<br> You can't use any of it?<br> You hate me now, don't you?<br> No, it's funny. I don't hate you.<br> I hate myself for not using cutaways.<br> It was terrific up to that point.<br> Let's go, folks.<br> Back to one. Into position.<br> Do I have time<br> to go to the men's room?<br> You bet.<br> Back to one!<br> Don't hit your chest<br> because of the body mike.<br> I'm lucky to get through that speech<br> at all. If I hit my chest, forgive me.<br> You'd hit my chest too.<br> Work with us, people!<br> Back to one as quickly as possible!<br> - Reloading.<br> - You can say that again.<br> - I will after the next shot.<br> - If I make it all the way through.<br> Very nice, guys. Tom, take this out.<br> Back to one, please.<br> Where's my plane ticket?<br> You fuck up my movie, I'll kill you.<br> You know what I'm talking about<br> and so does everybody on this set.<br> I don't care what you do to your body<br> on your time, but this is my time.<br> I won't have some spoiled, selfish,<br> coked-up little actress ruin my movie.<br> Pull yourself together<br> and work with us these last days...<br> ...or I'll kill you<br> before you kill yourself.<br> I'll do a better job. You're so<br> out of it, you'd botch that up.<br> Can you do the shot<br> straight through this time?<br> Yeah.<br> Okay, back to one.<br> Let's try it again.<br> What's your name?<br> - Cindy.<br> - Cindy. That's perfect.<br> Get your ass off this set<br> and don't come back.<br> If I catch you on this set, supplying<br> her with drugs, I'll call the cops.<br> Shoo! Get!<br> Is that about everything?<br> Anybody else want to be arrested<br> or killed before we wrap this?<br> Let's do the shot.<br> I feel like I slept<br> under an elephant's foot.<br> Slugabed.<br> It's almost 11:30.<br> Suz.<br> Sleeping Beauty?<br> What was the name of that man<br> who slept for 100 years?<br> Rapunzel. No.<br> Rip van Winkle.<br> Mrs. Winkle,<br> this is your wake-up call.<br> Suzanne.<br> Suzanne.<br> - Delivery!<br> - Excuse me?<br> Delivery. I'm dropping someone off.<br> I'm dropping someone off!<br> Isn't this an emergency room?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, this is an emergency!<br> Are you a relation of hers?<br> Oh, no. No relation.<br> I barely know her. I found her<br> like this and I brought her here.<br> - Will she be okay?<br> - I don't know.<br> Where can we reach you?<br> I'll call. There's empty<br> bottles of pills in her purse.<br> I think that's what she took.<br> Thanks.<br> What'd she take?<br> - Pills. Demerol, Percodan, cocaine.<br> - Give me her vitals.<br> Blood pressure's 84/20<br> and she's tachycardic.<br> - What's she saying?<br> - Something about being foolish.<br> You can say that again.<br> - You want ipecac?<br> - She's too unresponsive.<br> We have to pump your stomach!<br> Do I have to be there?<br> Nasty dream?<br> Everybody has those.<br> You'll have them for a while.<br> Great.<br> I'm Julie Marsden, director of the<br> rehab unit. I'm here to admit you.<br> Excuse me?<br> Which part is confusing you?<br> I'm in rehab?<br> Yes, Dr. Feldman and your mother<br> had you transferred...<br> ...from the emergency room last night.<br> I'm in a rehab?<br> You don't remember<br> having your stomach pumped?<br> Oh. That's what...<br> My mother knows?<br> She was here while<br> you were unconscious last night.<br> Great.<br> Oh, God.<br> Why did they pump my stomach?<br> You would have died if they hadn't.<br> Why can't I remember anything?<br> You were probably in a blackout.<br> And you don't remember<br> taking any drugs?<br> Oh, well, sure.<br> Some, but not, I mean...<br> How did I get to the emergency room?<br> A man dropped you off unconscious.<br> Who?<br> I'm not a detective.<br> I'm here to admit you<br> and, God willing, help you.<br> I'd like to ask a few questions.<br> A guy dropped me off?<br> Did you try to take your life?<br> - Oh, please!<br> - I'm sorry if the question offends you.<br> But having to have your stomach pumped<br> indicates fairly suicidal behaviour.<br> Well, the behaviour might be,<br> but I'm certainly not.<br> I want you to know<br> that I know you're scared.<br> And that this is<br> the place to handle it.<br> I don't really understand<br> how I almost died. That's not...<br> That's never what I wanted to do.<br> What did you want to do?<br> I don't know.<br> Good.<br> That's your first step.<br> I just feel like<br> if I don't do what you want...<br> ...you're gonna leave me.<br> You'll punish me.<br> All right, all right.<br> Let's stop there for the day.<br> Good work, Carol.<br> Okay, everybody, before we go,<br> I'd like to introduce...<br> ...a newcomer, Suzanne,<br> who's just out of detox.<br> Hi, Suzanne, and welcome.<br> Weren't your parents coming tonight?<br> My mother, you mean.<br> No, my mother's working.<br> She's coming if she can.<br> We should all visit with our<br> significant others for a few minutes.<br> Suzanne, could I talk to you?<br> Deal with your feelings<br> before they deal with you.<br> Do you always talk in bumper stickers?<br> Addiction isn't the problem,<br> it's the solution.<br> - You do.<br> - Until you remove the solution...<br> ...you can't see what the problem is.<br> This anger's not about me.<br> Who are you angry with?<br> Hello, darling!<br> Hello, dear.<br> Hi, Mama.<br> Am I too late for the family thing?<br> Yeah, but it's okay.<br> I did not want to miss that. How did<br> it go? What's wrong with your hair?<br> - It's all the rage in the rehab.<br> - Excuse me, Suzanne.<br> Can I meet your mother?<br> - Sure. Bart, this is my mom.<br> - I can't believe I'm meeting you.<br> - Since I was 7, I wanted to be you.<br> - Bart does you in his drag show.<br> - This is my lover, Allen.<br> - Hello, Allen.<br> What number do you do?<br> "Whistling Pines. "<br> My costume's like the one you wore...<br> ...in That Marvellous Mrs. Markham.<br> The one with the corset?<br> That was so difficult to wear.<br> Sorry, boys.<br> - Nice meeting you.<br> - Very nice meeting you. See you.<br> Dear, sorry, but you know<br> how much the queens love me.<br> Whistling pines<br> Call out to me<br> Under the stars<br> You'll hear the trees<br> - She looks fabulous.<br> - Who do you think did her?<br> Dr. Klein. He does all of them.<br> I wonder what Allen does.<br> This is my new roommate, Aretha.<br> How do you do? How rude of me.<br> I was excited to see my daughter.<br> Aretha's an unusual name.<br> I know. I think my parents<br> were expecting someone black.<br> Are you black?<br> No.<br> It's very nice to meet you.<br> Suzanne has told me so much about you.<br> I think I'll go<br> weave a basket or something...<br> ...and let the two of you visit.<br> - She seems very unusual.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm glad you're making new friends.<br> Thanks, Mom!<br> Have you talked to Marty?<br> Not yet.<br> - You should.<br> - I know.<br> You're supposed<br> to start that new film.<br> - I'm not doing it.<br> - Don't do it. I'll tell you why.<br> I'm not going to do it.<br> First: It is not a pivotal project<br> in your career.<br> Two: You'll need time<br> to rest and explore.<br> And C: You should change agents. I<br> don't like what they're doing for you.<br> Careers need planning. Your big<br> problem is, you're too impatient.<br> You only want instant gratification.<br> - Instant gratification takes too long.<br> - Don't think about that now.<br> I'll handle everything while<br> you're in here. No pressure.<br> I don't want anything<br> hanging over your head.<br> I want you to be absolutely clear.<br> I promised myself I would not<br> do this and look at me.<br> I didn't want you to see me get upset.<br> I hate getting upset.<br> I really hate that<br> you have to go through this.<br> I wish I could do it for you.<br> Ever since you were a little girl, I<br> had this feeling that I'd lose you...<br> ...that you'd be taken from me early.<br> As opposed to later,<br> when it would be more convenient?<br> You are tough. You're just<br> like Grandma, always judging me.<br> - We don't need to go over this again.<br> - You never let me talk.<br> It's just that I feel like<br> I'm not talking to you sometimes.<br> It feels like I'm talking<br> to your drama coach.<br> You think you could try<br> not being so mad at me?<br> I'll rinse these.<br> I have Woolite in my purse.<br> - It's handy for the road.<br> - Leave it!<br> I'll have some clothes<br> brought by tomorrow...<br> ...and your tape cassette thing<br> for your music and a quilt.<br> Sunday afternoon, Mary will bring<br> your video machine and some tapes...<br> ...and a plant.<br> It's so blah in here.<br> I don't know how you stand it,<br> everything one colour.<br> Flowers for you, Suzanne.<br> Who died?<br> Both of us almost did, for a start.<br> Who are they from?<br> They're from the guy<br> who pumped my stomach.<br> Bullshit.<br> " Hope your stomach is better.<br> You seem to me to be<br> what my mother warned me about:<br> A beautiful and overly<br> sensitive person. "<br> He can tell from<br> the contents of your stomach.<br> I have to be sensitive to need dope.<br> I'm tempted to marry him<br> so I can tell people how we met.<br> Lowell Korshack's on the phone again.<br> Tell him I'm detoxing.<br> He's a director I was working with.<br> I don't want to talk to him.<br> I'm embarrassed.<br> I don't have to, do I?<br> You don't have to do anything<br> you don't want to.<br> Except never take drugs and go to AA<br> meetings for the rest of your life.<br> Oh, I feel so much better.<br> What can I say?<br> The upshot of the whole thing is<br> that your being in the clinic...<br> ...made you a high risk to do a movie.<br> They want me to do it.<br> I talked to the director.<br> The director is not the problem.<br> It's the insurance company.<br> They won't cover you if you do drugs.<br> What can I say?<br> I'm not doing any drugs.<br> We know. These are businessmen...<br> ...with no knowledge<br> of creative personalities.<br> Actors are not treated well.<br> And actresses are treated like...<br> ...I hate to use the word, but, shit.<br> I remember when I was 15 years old.<br> Mr. Mayer called me in for a meeting.<br> He was on the toilet.<br> We had the meeting<br> with him on the toilet.<br> You can be sure he wouldn't have done<br> that to John Garfield. Correct.<br> She doesn't like me to talk.<br> Doris, you better let<br> Uncle Marty handle this.<br> She'll listen to you,<br> you're not her mother.<br> Suzy, what can I say?<br> Other actresses and actors...<br> ...who have not come to work<br> due to a drug or alcohol problem...<br> ...cost the insurance companies a lot<br> of money. Can you see their problem?<br> I do see. I'm being punished.<br> If you'll let me finish,<br> you'll see this is not all bad news.<br> Your Uncle Marty talked to<br> the insurance company this morning...<br> ...and they'll cover you...<br> ...if you stay with a " responsible<br> party" for the run of the film.<br> What am I supposed to do?<br> Go to a halfway house<br> for wayward SAG members?<br> If you calm down a bit,<br> you'll see it's not that bad.<br> They said they'd cover you if you stay<br> with one or both of your parents.<br> What can I say? I said<br> your father lives in New York.<br> - So, what about Doris?<br> - Excuse me?<br> She can't stay with her father.<br> He's worse than she is.<br> - Not that you're bad.<br> - Stay with my mother?<br> I'm not a teenager!<br> I lived with my parents until I was<br> Doris, please. Thank you.<br> Maybe it would be better to wait<br> a few months to go back to work.<br> - Go to your AA meetings...<br> - I want to do this film.<br> I can go to meetings and work.<br> I do better when I work.<br> She's exactly like me<br> when I was her age.<br> - I never stopped working.<br> - I feel I belong, I feel necessary.<br> It was good therapy after<br> my divorce and my miscarriages.<br> In those days,<br> the material was a lot better.<br> Doris. So you got it right?<br> These are the conditions<br> for doing this film.<br> For the run of the film,<br> you stay with your mother.<br> You can have your old room.<br> Great.<br> Okay, I'll stay with her. You.<br> You know what they say,<br> " No pain, no gain. "<br> Well, no wonder I'm so hefty.<br> Hefty?<br> If anything, you are too thin.<br> Now, me. My stomach, that's hefty.<br> Mom, I was kidding.<br> I don't get your generation's humour.<br> I don't have a generation.<br> Then I think you should get one.<br> I got it right here.<br> Morning, I'm Ted. Designed to make<br> your life a more annoying place to be.<br> I'm Suzanne, designed to be annoyed.<br> Then we'll get along just great.<br> - This, of course, is your...<br> - My hamster cage.<br> - Your resting place.<br> - My final resting place.<br> I dreamed it would end like this.<br> Alone in a tiny room with an AM radio.<br> It won't end like this,<br> it'll just middle.<br> It'll end in a larger room...<br> ...with air conditioning<br> and an AM/FM radio.<br> I have news to cheer you up.<br> The producer's coming to see you.<br> One of them.<br> - How many are there?<br> - Three.<br> The Father, the Son<br> and the Holy Ghost.<br> Which one am I<br> endearing myself to today?<br> - Anybody home?<br> - Morning.<br> Hi. Joe Pierce.<br> Just came by to welcome you aboard.<br> - You ready for makeup?<br> - Soon.<br> Any more people in here,<br> we'll need a lubricant.<br> Ted, thanks.<br> We'll see you out there.<br> Rob, get the door, please.<br> Suzanne, this is my agent,<br> Rob Sonnenfeld.<br> He came by to make sure<br> that we're all A-OK.<br> Nice to see you.<br> We came by to say hi and make sure<br> everything's up to snuff.<br> Yeah, everything's great.<br> And we'll need a drug screen.<br> Excuse me?<br> It's not for us.<br> We're not worried about you at all.<br> The damn insurance company<br> won't cover you without a screen.<br> I see.<br> We're behind you a hundred percent.<br> It's just...<br> ...a formality.<br> Yeah, I understand totally.<br> So do you want blood or urine?<br> I think urine would be fine.<br> Do you have a cup or something<br> that I can put it in?<br> Don't worry about that.<br> We'll have the nurse come by<br> and pick that up later.<br> It's great to have this little chat.<br> We're gonna leave you.<br> Do what you have to do.<br> We'll see you outside, okay?<br> Okay, great. Go, go, go.<br> Have fun.<br> Thanks.<br> - Who do these belong to?<br> - They're Frank's.<br> - Frankie, I got your shirt.<br> - Watch your back!<br> Good morning.<br> Hi there. You're just the cop<br> I'm looking for.<br> We're ready for a lineup.<br> Are we gonna get a rehearsal<br> by any chance?<br> You got this film confused<br> with a big-budget film.<br> The lower the budget, the fewer<br> the rehearsals, the worse the food.<br> Hello, darling! Great day for it.<br> You look glorious. Big kiss.<br> Cactus.<br> Stick your arms<br> through the holes please.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Hi. Suzanne.<br> Robert Munch.<br> Quiet, please! We're gonna<br> do a block for camera.<br> There's a lot of dialogue,<br> so we need total cooperation.<br> Also, keep in mind there are<br> live snakes in this shot...<br> ...so we need you to be very careful.<br> Come in.<br> Your mom's here.<br> How was your day, dear?<br> They made me do a drug test.<br> I knew it.<br> I knew you shouldn't do this picture.<br> Yeah, because it's a bad film, not<br> because they'd make me do a drug test.<br> I don't analyse the way you do.<br> It just felt wrong to me.<br> I had a dream that it wasn't right.<br> You don't believe my dreams,<br> even the one about your kidney stone.<br> - I'd really like a Percodan.<br> - I had a dream the other night.<br> - I had a dream that I was drowning.<br> - Two Percodan. Make that three.<br> - A sequined gown dragging me down.<br> - What does that mean?<br> I don't want to alarm you,<br> but I do want to prepare you.<br> I didn't tell you this before<br> because of the drug clinic thing.<br> Remember my hysterectomy?<br> - The one last year?<br> - Right. Well, they found tumours.<br> - Really?<br> - Fibroid tumours.<br> But isn't that normal?<br> Usually. Usually it's normal.<br> But in our family<br> all the women die young.<br> Grandma's still alive.<br> Barely, and don't contradict me.<br> I might not be around for much longer.<br> I don't want to alarm you.<br> I want to prepare you for my death.<br> It is so important that you understand<br> how precious your life is to me.<br> How did we end up talking about<br> your death from my drug test?<br> I don't understand. Could we not talk?<br> I don't feel very well.<br> You should have Dr. Feldman look<br> at you. Maybe you have tumours.<br> Mine was big as a grapefruit.<br> I'm gonna kill myself.<br> Don't say that, even in jest, Suzanne.<br> You were in a drug clinic.<br> People might take it the wrong way.<br> Looks as though<br> there's a party going on here.<br> I invited a few friends over<br> to celebrate your coming home.<br> Oh, no, Mom. I have to get up early.<br> I don't want to see them.<br> All right, if you want,<br> I'll tell them all to go home.<br> Surprise!<br> My little girl is home.<br> There are people here<br> I haven't seen since high school...<br> ...nor would I want to.<br> Louis Karasik!<br> For chrissake, where did<br> she come up with Louis Karasik?<br> Last time I saw him, he threw up<br> scrambled eggs out of his nose...<br> ...on the way to the library.<br> Let me look at you, before your fat<br> old grandmother goes home to bed!<br> Give me a hug, you fat old grandma.<br> You sure do stink pretty.<br> This is my friend Aretha.<br> - Hi and bye. We're hitting the road.<br> - Not yet.<br> Your mother started drinking wine.<br> She'll rattle off<br> at the mouth all night.<br> I'm hightailing it out of here.<br> Now that you're better,<br> why don't you get her to stop?<br> I know. Ornery as a mule,<br> just like Owen.<br> - I heard that!<br> - Well, you are bullheaded, honey.<br> Don't you want more cashews, Grandpa?<br> - Did I have some already?<br> - He's worse every day.<br> Who gets worse? I heard that.<br> Get off my back. I want to go home.<br> - Yeah, well, we're going.<br> - Not with you!<br> I want to go home.<br> Are we going soon?<br> Soon, sir. Very, very soon.<br> - You know what my daddy did?<br> - What?<br> - What are we talking about?<br> - I told you.<br> I heard that!<br> Get off my back, woman!<br> Yap, yap, yap!<br> That's all you do,<br> all the livelong day.<br> And the farmer hauled<br> Another load away<br> The other day he punched me when<br> I tried to put clean pajamas on him.<br> I'm going to skedaddle, baby doll.<br> You ought to eat more, young lady.<br> You're no bigger than a pound of soap<br> after a hard day's wash.<br> Good night, sugar.<br> Gotta let them dogs out.<br> Howdy's got worms.<br> I have nothing to say.<br> The same cannot be said<br> for the rest of your family.<br> I love them, though. To me, she was<br> always this lovable, loud mountain.<br> Your mother wants you inside<br> to cut the cake.<br> Cake?<br> Sing something, Suzanne.<br> Wonderful idea!<br> - Come on, sweetheart.<br> - I can't, Mama.<br> Sing one of your old numbers<br> from my act.<br> I don't want to. Really.<br> One number for your old mother.<br> Come on.<br> You know that...<br> You give your hand to me<br> That Ray Charles tune.<br> - And then you say hello<br> - Keep going.<br> And / can hardly speak<br> Can hardly sing.<br> My heart is beating so<br> And anyone can tell<br> That's it.<br> You think you know me well<br> Sweet song.<br> Well, you don't know me<br> No, you don't know the one<br> Who dreams of you at night<br> And longs to kiss your lips<br> And longs to hold you tight<br> To you /'m just a friend<br> And that's all that /'ve ever been<br> But you don't know me<br> I don't know the bridge.<br> Afraid and shy<br> / let my chance go by<br> A chance that<br> You might have loved me too<br> You give your hand to me<br> And then you say goodbye<br> / want to walk away<br> All / can do is cry<br> No one will ever know<br> The one who loves you so<br> No, you don't know me<br> That was so lovely, dear.<br> I don't know why you don't<br> sing any longer.<br> - I get so nervous.<br> - But you shouldn't.<br> You have such a terrific voice.<br> Such a terrific talent.<br> Now, Doris sing something.<br> Come on, Doris.<br> I couldn't. No, this is<br> my daughter's night. Really.<br> Come on.<br> - Do you think I should, really?<br> - Yes.<br> All right.<br> You sang for me, I'll sing for you.<br> " I'm Still Here" in D flat.<br> Good times and bum times<br> /'ve seen them all<br> And my dear, /'m still here<br> Darn right you are!<br> Plush velvet sometimes<br> Sometimes just pretzels and beer<br> But /'m here<br> Ten years of braces, voice and tap<br> Touring in places off the map<br> Getting auditions on Zanuck's lap<br> Never fear<br> My mother drew up the contract<br> So /'m here<br> /'ve done commercials<br> And club dates and talk shows<br> Gee, that was fun and a half<br> When you've done commercials<br> And club dates and talk shows<br> Anything else is a laugh<br> Black sable one day<br> The next day it goes into hock<br> But /'m here<br> Top billing Monday<br> Tuesday you're touring in stock<br> But /'m here<br> First you're another true-blue tramp<br> Then someone's mother<br> Then you're camp<br> Then you career from career to career<br> /'m feeling transcendental<br> Am / here?<br> /'ve gotten through,<br> "Hey, lady, aren't you who's its?<br> Gee, what a looker you were. "<br> Or better yet,<br> "Sorry, / thought you were who's its.<br> Whatever happened to her?"<br> Good times and bum times<br> /'ve seen them all<br> And my dear, / am still here<br> Smooth sailing sometimes<br> Sometimes a kick in the rear<br> But /'m here<br> /'ve run the gamut, A to Z<br> Three cheers<br> And damn it, c'est la vie<br> / got through all of last year<br> And /'m here<br> Lord knows, at least / was there<br> And /'m here<br> Look who's here<br> /'m still...<br> ...here<br> Cut!<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - Hey, Simon.<br> We've got some adjustments,<br> you've got 15 minutes.<br> What's happening?<br> Did they make you do a drug test too?<br> No, no. It's nothing, really.<br> The producers saw the rushes<br> last night.<br> They had some rather<br> interesting notes.<br> - Well, what?<br> - Now, don't take it the wrong way.<br> I saw them this morning.<br> They were fine, you were fine. Really.<br> It was my first day.<br> I couldn't agree with you more.<br> It was your first day.<br> They basically felt that you...<br> ...could have fun with it.<br> You know, just have<br> more fun with it, that's all.<br> Fancy meeting you here.<br> Neil Bleene, associate producer.<br> I understand<br> my enjoyment levels are down.<br> No, we felt the performance was fine.<br> But you're holding something back.<br> Holding something back?<br> I've been in the theatre.<br> I'm actually a theatre director.<br> Sometimes certain line-readings apply.<br> Like in comedy, it is a rule.<br> Inflections go up at the end.<br> That's a comedy rule?<br> Well, not so much rule as guideline.<br> You were very good in Public Domain.<br> What did you do there?<br> Thanks. I rehearsed.<br> I guess I don't take<br> criticism very well.<br> But I mean, I've had one day<br> of work on this...<br> ...and two conversations about<br> what's missing in my performance.<br> We're talking about<br> two minutes of film.<br> Two minutes out of 90.<br> Is it correctable?<br> Oh, come on.<br> It's not as though you farted<br> during all your dialogue...<br> ...and we sat in rushes saying,<br> "What's that noise over her lines?"<br> I'm so relieved.<br> That analogy's bathed me in relief.<br> Well, Neil, thank you very much for<br> the acting tips and the pep talk.<br> My pleasure.<br> - I'm feeling much more relaxed now.<br> - Good.<br> Can't we put her in a girdle?<br> Not with that dress. Maybe control-top<br> pantyhose, but it may not be enough.<br> All right, all right.<br> Anything. Just do something.<br> We have to get her into pants, not<br> shorts. The tops of her legs are...<br> Bulbous. She has cellulite.<br> I wish we could get her<br> to stop eating so much.<br> I guess having given up drugs,<br> she has to do something.<br> You think we can get her<br> to start smoking?<br> What are we going to do<br> about the bed scene?<br> Cheat the angle, I presume.<br> Her breasts are rather<br> out of shape, aren't they?<br> If you have her on her back,<br> as the script indicates...<br> ...her tits will move off<br> into her armpits.<br> How very unpleasant.<br> Well, perhaps you should<br> buy a camisole.<br> I had no idea she was so<br> out of shape when I hired her.<br> But we wouldn't have got her<br> if she was in her prime.<br> If you'll forgive me, with her<br> reputation she's lucky to have a job.<br> She pretty much destroyed her career.<br> This is a break for her.<br> You're right.<br> It's sad, though, isn't it? She was<br> so good in A Night Full of Shoes.<br> I hope it's not<br> too much trouble for you.<br> I'm almost sorry<br> we didn't get Valerie Rogers.<br> Valerie has a terrific body.<br> Oh, well. See you.<br> George Lazan, executive producer<br> of Kitchen Sink...<br> ...and now, L.A. Beat.<br> How are you?<br> Fine.<br> - Suzanne.<br> - Vale. I know.<br> Have I caught you at a bad time?<br> I saw the rushes.<br> And frankly, you're holding back.<br> - What seems to be the problem?<br> - The problem...<br> The problem is that hundreds<br> of people have talked with me...<br> ...about my low enjoyment levels<br> and my...<br> It bothered me. I'd prefer<br> to receive direction solely from you.<br> Really? Hundreds?<br> I'll have a word with them.<br> I mean, we're talking<br> about one day of work.<br> A day in which I was tied<br> to a cactus and assaulted by snakes.<br> As if I were a child!<br> They could call my mother to come in<br> and stand by and make sure I'm relaxed!<br> That's her! That's the character!<br> That's the quality I've been<br> looking for! Now, what you're doing.<br> But Simon, this is not relaxed!<br> This is incredibly upset!<br> - If this is the quality...<br> - People, this'll be picture!<br> Just be yourself and you'll be fine.<br> It sounds trite, but it's true.<br> Just trust me.<br> I'll speak with the producer.<br> I promise what happened today won't<br> be repeated. Try to calm down, okay?<br> Quiet on the set!<br> - Roll sound!<br> - Speed.<br> Roll camera.<br> Marker.<br> Roll plate.<br> Action.<br> Help. Help me.<br> Help me!<br> It's me!<br> - Jack.<br> - Oh, sure! Jack.<br> - How've you been?<br> - Great. You?<br> Great. Okay.<br> God, I've just had<br> this long, weird day so...<br> How long has it been<br> since we've seen each other?<br> Oh, too long. Way too long.<br> Good to see you now.<br> You too. You going to the reunion?<br> - What reunion?<br> - High school.<br> - You went to Beverly High!<br> - Where'd you think I knew you from?<br> I didn't mean it like a question,<br> "You went to Beverly?"<br> I meant it in a nostalgic way.<br> When's the reunion?<br> End of the month.<br> You remember Mr. Craverly?<br> The biology teacher.<br> It's terrible what happened to him.<br> What happened to him?<br> - Oh, I thought you knew.<br> - No.<br> He went to this party<br> and met this girl.<br> And she seemed tired, sick maybe.<br> He took her to a restaurant. Maybe<br> some food would make her feel better.<br> Next thing you know,<br> she goes home with him.<br> - You haven't heard this?<br> - She goes with him and then what?<br> He thinks it's a wonderful evening...<br> ...and then she takes<br> a handful of pills and overdoses.<br> - Then he drives her to the hospital.<br> - The next morning.<br> And he didn't leave his name.<br> Mr. Craverly, I presume.<br> At your service.<br> I don't have a service.<br> I have a machine.<br> I'm glad to see you're all right.<br> Well, I suppose I should thank you.<br> I could apologize for not leaving<br> my name at the hospital.<br> Under the circumstances,<br> it was probably secondary.<br> What's polite during an overdose<br> with a complete stranger?<br> I'm not a complete stranger.<br> More like a relative one. Like family.<br> I don't know what happened that night.<br> I can only guess.<br> No, I don't even want to do that.<br> I want you to know I'm not like that.<br> I don't know what I am like,<br> but I don't make a habit of...<br> What if I told you nothing happened?<br> Nothing what?<br> Nothing happened. We just talked.<br> Then you took my Daradil<br> and fell asleep.<br> Why? Am I so completely<br> unappealing to you?<br> Quite the contrary. It's just that<br> you were a little the worse...<br> ...or better for substances,<br> and I have rules about that.<br> Didn't Jimmy Stewart say that<br> to somebody in a movie?<br> Well, if he did,<br> then he darn sure should have!<br> I didn't sleep with you?<br> Sleep?<br> Yeah.<br> Kiss?<br> - What? Here, right now?<br> - No. Then. That night.<br> Well, does this ring a bell?<br> That rings something. I'm not sure<br> if it's the memory bell or...<br> How about this?<br> That reminds me of something<br> I should've done before.<br> Reminds me of something I'd like<br> to do later so I can look back on it.<br> I'm nostalgic already.<br> Did anybody ever tell you<br> that you smell like Catalina?<br> Yes, as a matter of fact,<br> just this morning.<br> Did anybody ever tell you<br> that you smell like the future?<br> " But I break just like a little girl. "<br> Oh, hello.<br> May I help you?<br> I'm here for Suzanne. Jack Falkner.<br> Jack. Well, I'm Suzanne's mother.<br> Is she expecting you?<br> I believe so.<br> We're driving to my ranch.<br> Come in.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'll just call her.<br> I hope you don't think I was rude.<br> You know how protective<br> mothers can be.<br> - You said you had a ranch?<br> - Yes, ma'am, in Malibu.<br> Way out in Malibu.<br> How nice for you.<br> Have you known Suzanne long?<br> We've known each other about a month.<br> Seems like longer, though.<br> I know what you mean. I'm her mother,<br> and it seems like longer.<br> She's a very interesting woman,<br> don't you think?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Authentic.<br> So you said you've known her<br> about a month?<br> Good morning, dear.<br> This is my husband, Sid Roth.<br> This is Suzanne's little friend Jim.<br> Jack. Good to meet you, Mr. Roth.<br> You certainly don't seem like<br> your average rancher to me.<br> Well, you don't seem like<br> your average mother.<br> If all ranchers looked like you,<br> there wouldn't be many crops.<br> That depends on<br> what you're raising, ma'am.<br> Certainly not doubts!<br> Oh, hello, dear. I was just coming<br> to get you. Your friend's here.<br> Could I just talk to you<br> for a second?<br> My daughter wants to talk to me.<br> What you watching, Mr. Roth?<br> I'd like to have people of my own...<br> ...without them having<br> to like you so much.<br> Why can't we share people?<br> Why must you take over every situation<br> and completely overshadow me?<br> I am not overshadowing you.<br> I don't care if he likes me or not.<br> - Your friend with the bedroom eyes.<br> - Right.<br> And the living room nose and<br> the kitchen forehead and den ears.<br> Wait, I can't.<br> Stop, please.<br> - I can't do this.<br> - Can't do what?<br> What do you mean "what"?<br> Re-upholster your furniture. This.<br> I don't have casual affairs.<br> Ever?<br> No.<br> There was a moment when I thought<br> I might have had one with you...<br> I don't want to have a casual affair.<br> Is this a proposal?<br> Do you joke about everything?<br> When things get too serious or stray<br> too far from what I can talk about.<br> Have we strayed too far?<br> Officially, yeah.<br> Look, I just got out of a drug clinic.<br> I'm uncomfortable with...<br> ...whatever this is. Feelings, okay?<br> So you have feelings for me?<br> - Don't do this.<br> - I want to know, because I do for you.<br> What?<br> Have feelings.<br> How many? More than two?<br> - I won't do this if you make fun of me.<br> - Promise?<br> I'm not going to make fun of you.<br> I am making fun of you.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm sorry. I'll stop.<br> What are you trying to say?<br> I think I love you.<br> - When will you know for sure?<br> - This is hard enough.<br> You can't be serious.<br> You just met me.<br> I'm as surprised as you are.<br> I thought I'd lost the ability.<br> With you, I...<br> I thought I was immune to movie stars.<br> But I've wanted you from<br> the first time I saw you on-screen.<br> And that never happens to me.<br> You're the realest person<br> I've ever met in the abstract.<br> You had a shot in Public Domain where<br> you looked at the camera, into me...<br> ...and I loved you.<br> I can't explain it.<br> You're doing pretty well.<br> But you're my fantasy, and I want<br> to make you real.<br> Let me love you.<br> You're serious?<br> I don't know what to say.<br> - I shouldn't have told you.<br> - It's good you told me. It's very...<br> ...brave.<br> Brave?<br> Right, because it's a long shot.<br> You could never love me back.<br> No, no, no. Well, who knows?<br> I mean...<br> You certainly are<br> infatuation material.<br> I love you.<br> You're crazy.<br> Stay with me.<br> Take a risk.<br> I'm worth the risk, you'll see.<br> I don't want to see anyone<br> or smell anyone but you.<br> I don't know when you're kidding.<br> I'm serious.<br> - Okay.<br> - You'll never be sorry.<br> You sound like a rug salesman.<br> My rug salesman.<br> Do you have any idea<br> what time it is, dear?<br> I suppose it never occurred to you that<br> you scared me by staying out so late.<br> I was about to call<br> all the emergency rooms.<br> I'm sorry, Mama.<br> I didn't call because I thought<br> you might be asleep.<br> I came home because I didn't want<br> to worry you.<br> You did worry me.<br> Look at me. I'm a wreck.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What if you'd been out taking drugs<br> or something?<br> I'm supposed to be taking care of you.<br> You're my responsibility.<br> You're my daughter.<br> What was I supposed to think<br> when you didn't come home?<br> You mind if I have a drink?<br> Do you mind if I drop acid?<br> Dear, I drink socially.<br> I took acid socially.<br> I hardly think my drinking can be<br> compared with your drug-taking.<br> Even if it could be...<br> ...your involvement with drugs<br> has vindicated me.<br> I hardly think you're in a position<br> to judge me.<br> I hope you weren't<br> sleeping with someone.<br> - I wasn't sleeping with...<br> - If you were, I hope you used condoms.<br> I didn't raise you to act this way.<br> I hope it's your morals in question,<br> not your judgment.<br> I'm middle-aged.<br> I'm middle-aged.<br> How many 120-year-old<br> women do you know?<br> You just got out of a drug clinic.<br> You don't know what's best for you.<br> Oh, and I suppose you do?<br> Suzanne, how did we become<br> so estranged?<br> I've tried to be a good mother to you.<br> Only to be met by this fresh<br> and superior attitude of yours.<br> You've felt you were my intellectual<br> superior since you were 14 years old.<br> Rightfully so.<br> You were always more verbal than me.<br> I.<br> Whatever.<br> Why did you turn away from me?<br> I just want you to like me.<br> I want to be your friend.<br> Could we have this conversation<br> in the morning? I'm very tired.<br> Every time I try to get close to you,<br> you push me away.<br> How'd you like to have Joan Crawford<br> for a mother? Or Lana Turner?<br> These are the options?<br> - You or Lana or Joan?<br> - When I had my breakdown...<br> ...I would've killed myself<br> if not for you.<br> It's just like that, that you say...<br> I don't know what to do with that.<br> I came from nothing<br> and I made something out of my life.<br> You come from somewhere and you're<br> trying to make nothing out of yours.<br> You should just get over what happened<br> to you in your adolescence.<br> It is time to move on.<br> Cut!<br> - Jack Falkner?<br> - Yeah, why?<br> He produced that Cambodian movie?<br> I guess. Why? You know him?<br> Ask Evelyn Ames about him.<br> Evelyn Ames that's playing<br> the prostitute?<br> Can I have your gun, please?<br> Thank you.<br> He says, "What am I gonna<br> do without you?"<br> So I say, " I don't know.<br> Juices, I guess.<br> Lots and lots of juices. "<br> Hi.<br> Could I talk to you just for a second?<br> Sure.<br> Come on, honey. It can't be that bad.<br> Oh, no. It's just...<br> It's about this guy.<br> It usually is.<br> Bobby said you might know him.<br> I guess I might. Who?<br> Jack Falkner.<br> You know him.<br> Yeah, you might say that.<br> You've slept with him.<br> Well, I don't know how much<br> of a rest I got.<br> Why?<br> What's the matter?<br> - Has he got...?<br> - Oh, no, no, no.<br> Oh, God, I hope not.<br> God, you scared me for a second.<br> I thought you were from a celebrity<br> AIDS notification board.<br> Could I ask you a personal question?<br> Asking who I sleep with isn't<br> personal anymore?<br> What do you want to know, if I smoke?<br> When did you see him last?<br> I don't know. A couple days ago.<br> Saturday. Saturday afternoon.<br> Saturday afternoon.<br> Yeah, why?<br> I was with him Saturday night.<br> That's two girls in one day.<br> That's just the ones we know about.<br> Imagine what you could pick up<br> if you got a satellite dish.<br> How can you laugh? It's disgusting!<br> Especially in this day and age.<br> You look like somebody who can take<br> care of herself. Buy some condoms.<br> Don't feel bad.<br> He probably really likes you.<br> He didn't give you his big<br> Walt Whitman speech, did he?<br> The one about genius?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - That's a good sign.<br> That's his standard pickup line.<br> That and the big Cambodian speech.<br> And the thing about<br> smelling like Catalina.<br> That I've heard.<br> That's not bad. One out of three.<br> You're obviously getting some new<br> stuff, which means he must like you.<br> So he goes out with lots of people.<br> Yeah, sure. That's his big thing:<br> Women.<br> So if you can just enjoy<br> yourself with him...<br> ...like he's enjoying himself<br> with you...<br> That's what I do.<br> I'm in it for the "endolphin" rush.<br> Endorphin.<br> Whatever.<br> Good morning, L.A. /t's burnt toast<br> and coffee time, 7.:30 a. m.<br> Jack?<br> - Morning.<br> - Hey, babe!<br> Oh, excuse me, officer.<br> Would you like to see my I.D.?<br> I've seen it.<br> Well, just hold that thought.<br> Hold it between your knees.<br> - Or would you join me?<br> - No, I'm on duty.<br> Be right out.<br> I saw someone you know last night.<br> Oh, yeah? Who?<br> Evelyn. Evelyn Ames.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - Where'd you see her?<br> - On the set. She's in this movie.<br> How's it going?<br> Great, now that my relaxation levels<br> have stabilized.<br> - I don't know how you put up with them.<br> - Neither do I.<br> - I would've quit.<br> - You can't quit.<br> If you quit, no one will hire<br> you again. I like working, so...<br> I like Evelyn.<br> - Yeah, I do too.<br> - Yeah, she told me.<br> She told you?<br> She told me you fucked her Saturday.<br> Saturday afternoon.<br> - Jesus, here we go.<br> - No, here you go.<br> Straight from her Saturday<br> afternoon to me that night!<br> - You have exclusive rights?<br> - What about moderation and discretion?<br> As far as discretion goes, what were<br> you and Evelyn doing, comparing notes?<br> No. She just told me<br> she fucked you on Saturday.<br> She marches up to you and blows her<br> wad? Or did you nose it out of her?<br> She said she was in it for the<br> endorphins. Sorry, the "endolphins. "<br> You said you loved me.<br> I meant it at the time.<br> What is it, a viral love?<br> A 24-hour thing?<br> Apparently Evelyn smells like<br> Catalina too. Must be going around.<br> I just got out of a drug clinic<br> and you manipulate me?<br> - Give me a break, we just met!<br> - That's what I said to you!<br> We should stop this. It's ridiculous.<br> I do not like this side of you.<br> I'm not a box with sides.<br> This is it! One side fits all!<br> You are so competitive!<br> - You're not?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> You're just a reaction to me?<br> You got this far by<br> not being competitive?<br> That's not competitive.<br> That's ambition and talent.<br> If you do say so yourself!<br> This is a jealous tantrum!<br> I am not jealous!<br> I am humiliated! How could you fuck<br> us both on the same day?<br> What bothers you? That it was<br> the same day or that it was Evelyn?<br> It's not that you fuck around a lot.<br> It's that you lie about it.<br> Could've told the truth, fucked<br> them all, had the cigarette with me.<br> That is such bullshit!<br> Women say, " It's not the fact that<br> you left. It's the way you did it. "<br> " It's not that you fuck around,<br> but you lie. "<br> You are all so full of shit!<br> It is the fact that I fuck around...<br> ...and it is the fact<br> that I will leave!<br> I have to stop this with you.<br> - Are we breaking up?<br> - We can't. We were never together.<br> - You're acting like a wife.<br> - Better than acting like a whore!<br> You can't judge me.<br> You were in a drug clinic.<br> Where you belong, Mr. Pothead.<br> Mr. Vodka, Mr. Bedroom Eyes.<br> You're a virgin? You weren't<br> hard to convince the first night.<br> I thought we didn't do anything.<br> I lied.<br> You were more fun<br> when you were loaded!<br> And Public Domain<br> was a piece of shit!<br> Relax, they're blanks. Asshole.<br> Hi, Ma.<br> I was just looking for some aspirin.<br> Did you find it?<br> Yep.<br> Good.<br> Why are you still wearing<br> your costume?<br> I was in a hurry.<br> I have some news.<br> What?<br> You dreamt I lost some weight?<br> Endorsed a line of clothing?<br> Don't be fresh, dear.<br> Don't you have looping this morning?<br> Shit!<br> How do you expect to get anywhere in<br> this business if you don't show up?<br> Dear?<br> I have something...<br> ...inevitable to tell you.<br> I don't want you to be angry<br> with me for having predicted it.<br> What?<br> Your beloved business manager,<br> Marty Weiner...<br> ...the man you stayed with,<br> the one I begged you to leave...<br> - Mom?<br> - Yes, darling?<br> The news?<br> I know.<br> I don't want to say. I know how upset<br> you'll be. I know how upset I was.<br> Marty Weiner has disappeared.<br> Disappeared?<br> The police called to say he is<br> nowhere to be found...<br> ...and neither is his clients' money.<br> Meaning what, that I have no money?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Can't they find him? Can't I sue him?<br> I contacted your stepfather's lawyer,<br> Samuel Stone.<br> He's terrific. He's on it.<br> Oh, that's perfect. Just perfect.<br> Thank God I got sober so I'm hyper-<br> conscious for these humiliations!<br> Shit.<br> Dear, it's no good<br> feeling sorry for yourself.<br> You're gonna have to overcome<br> these difficulties.<br> You might as well do it<br> with some style.<br> You could easily make an enormous<br> amount of money if you'd only sing.<br> You have a God-given talent<br> and you just throw it away.<br> You could be much bigger than Madonna.<br> She hasn't got half your voice.<br> You'd have to stop smoking. You could<br> make an album. I'd produce it.<br> I'm getting out of the business.<br> If I don't, I'll never have any kind<br> of a chance at having a normal life.<br> Let's take this one thing at a time.<br> First, everyone is always getting out<br> of the business.<br> And B: You are just like me.<br> Some days I wake up...<br> Will you please stop telling me<br> how to run my life...<br> ...for a couple of minutes?<br> Isn't it enough that you were right?<br> You feel sorry for yourself for having<br> a monster of a mother like me.<br> Everything about you says,<br> "See what you did?"<br> I never said "monster. "<br> You don't say it, but you feel it.<br> Somehow you lay the entire blame<br> for your drug-taking on me.<br> I do not. I do not, Mother.<br> I took the drugs, nobody made me.<br> Go ahead and say it.<br> You think I'm an alcoholic.<br> Okay.<br> I think you're an alcoholic.<br> Maybe I was an alcoholic<br> when you were a teenager...<br> ...but I had a breakdown when my<br> marriage failed and I lost my money.<br> That's when I started taking drugs.<br> I got over it. Now I just<br> drink like an Irish person.<br> You drink to relax.<br> You just enjoy your wine.<br> I know, you've told me.<br> You don't want me to be a singer.<br> You're the singer.<br> You're the performer.<br> I can't possibly compete with you.<br> What if somebody won?<br> You want me to do well...<br> ...just not better than you.<br> You are jealous because I can drink<br> and you can't take drugs any longer.<br> - I can handle it and you can't.<br> - Handle it? How do you handle it?<br> My drinking does not<br> interfere with my work.<br> I wish my mother had been as concerned<br> about me when I was a little girl!<br> Will you tell me what awful thing<br> I did to you when you were a child?<br> - You want to know?<br> - Tell me!<br> Fine. From the time I was 9<br> you gave me sleeping pills!<br> It was over-the-counter medication.<br> - You couldn't sleep!<br> - You don't give kids sleeping pills.<br> They were not sleeping pills!<br> It was store-bought and it was<br> perfectly safe!<br> And don't blame me<br> for your drug-taking!<br> I do not blame my mother<br> for my misfortunes or for my drinking.<br> You don't admit you drink!<br> How can you blame her<br> for something you don't even do!<br> Remember my 17th birthday party<br> when you lifted your skirt up...<br> - ... in front of...<br> - I did not lift my skirt!<br> It twirled up!<br> You only remember the bad stuff.<br> What about the big band I got to play?<br> Do you remember that? No!<br> You only remember that my skirt<br> accidentally twirled up!<br> And you weren't wearing underwear.<br> Well...<br> Dear, I am sorry if you think<br> I hurt you.<br> Everything I did,<br> I did out of love for you.<br> I might've done wrong sometimes.<br> How can you do everything right?<br> Can we...? Let's just stop.<br> I made some mistakes, but I'm human.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To cut an album.<br> I'm gonna go have<br> some fibroid tumours removed.<br> I'm going to fucking loop.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What are you sorry about?<br> - I thought I was late.<br> - No.<br> We didn't expect you for half an hour.<br> Oh, well, so, is it okay now?<br> Yeah, it's okay now.<br> Victor, Miss Vale is here.<br> Would you put up her reels now, please?<br> Wasn't that simple?<br> Oh, excuse me. Suzanne, this is<br> our editor, Phil Hartley...<br> ...and sound editor, Elliot Morse.<br> Ready, Lowell.<br> Thank you. Shall we begin?<br> Could I have some coke...<br> ... a-cola? Please.<br> - Could you get Suzanne a Coke, please?<br> - Sure.<br> You're better in the film<br> than you deserve to be.<br> Good. I mean, thank you.<br> I'm sorry I was such a nightmare.<br> You seem better now.<br> Really? No, I don't.<br> - Better because you're sober...<br> - Worse because I'm sober.<br> Yes, but worse in a good way.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thank you.<br> We have more spirit<br> and resources than you.<br> All it'll cost us is money.<br> There isn't enough mommy in the world<br> to further your cause.<br> Shit.<br> That's as good as it got all day.<br> We never got a full take after that.<br> I know. I'm sorry.<br> Don't be sorry, just fix it.<br> What?<br> Okay, let's try one.<br> Could I get a level from you, please?<br> There isn't enough money in the world<br> to further your cause.<br> Bring it down a little.<br> Can you try again, please?<br> - Good.<br> - Okay, let's do it.<br> Can I do another?<br> I have to do it one more time.<br> Let's look at that.<br> Perfect.<br> Will you guys take...?<br> Take five minutes, will you, please?<br> Thank you.<br> What could possibly be the matter?<br> You've gone back and corrected<br> the past, at least in your work.<br> What could be a better metaphor?<br> It couldn't be something I said.<br> Nothing you say to me is as horrible<br> as what I say to myself.<br> And at least it's outside my head<br> where I can deal with it.<br> You've had it too easy<br> and you don't know it.<br> No, no. I do know it.<br> You're not gonna get<br> a lot of sympathy.<br> People would give their right arm<br> to lead the kind of life you lead.<br> I know, but the trouble is,<br> I can't feel my life.<br> I can't feel it. I see it all<br> around me and I know...<br> ...that so much of it is good.<br> But I just take it the wrong way.<br> It's like this thing...<br> ...with my mother. I know she does<br> all this stuff because she loves me...<br> ...but I just can't believe it.<br> And other stuff.<br> I don't know about your mother.<br> Maybe she'll stop mothering you<br> when you grow up.<br> - You don't know my mother.<br> - I don't.<br> I know you can make<br> a mother out of anybody.<br> Look, your mother did it to you,<br> and her mother did it to her...<br> ...and back all the way to Eve.<br> At some point, you stop it and say:<br> " Fuck it. I start with me. "<br> Did you just make that up?<br> I was working on it before you came.<br> If you were half an hour later...<br> ...it would have been better.<br> It's pretty good as it is.<br> It sounds like movie dialogue.<br> That's me. I don't want life to<br> imitate art, I want life to be art.<br> Look.<br> Look at that.<br> See what you can do?<br> You weren't even conscious then,<br> for chrissake.<br> Imagine what you could do now.<br> Maybe I should just...<br> ...go back to the clinic?<br> Growing up isn't like in a movie...<br> ...where you have a realization<br> and life changes.<br> In life, you have a realization and<br> your life changes a month or so later.<br> So I just have to wait a month?<br> It depends on the realization.<br> Some of them you only wait<br> a couple weeks.<br> Look...<br> ...you're better here coping<br> than in a clinic giving up.<br> You're gonna be out here<br> eventually coping anyway.<br> So why don't you start now?<br> Anyway...<br> ...you can't go to the hospital.<br> I've got a job for you.<br> You wouldn't be ashamed<br> to work with me again?<br> It doesn't start for a few months,<br> so you have time for realizations.<br> Grow up. Leave your mother.<br> Thank you, God.<br> What happened?<br> Lady plowed into a tree.<br> Where's the lady? Is she all right?<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm her daughter.<br> She hit her head.<br> She's at Canyon Medical Centre.<br> Look, I'm afraid we had to book her<br> for driving under the influence.<br> Thank you.<br> May I help you?<br> Miss Vale. Your mother's getting<br> patched up. I'll take you to her.<br> I'm afraid the press has been alerted<br> to your mother's presence here...<br> - ... and her arrest.<br> - Oh, great.<br> Doctor, this is Miss Mann's daughter.<br> Your mom's fine. It's a slight<br> contusion. A superficial wound.<br> - Can I see her?<br> - Yeah. Sure, sure.<br> She's more frightened than anything.<br> There she is, my other monster.<br> I can't seem to keep you two out<br> of the hospital lately.<br> She's fine.<br> She just bumped her head is all.<br> She was worried about you.<br> She got into her car and backed<br> up a tree.<br> Why am I in this family?<br> I got a wino daughter<br> and a doped-up granddaughter.<br> Oh, sure. " Cry all you want. You'll<br> pee less," as my grandma used to say.<br> I swear. I don't know where<br> you get it from. But you!<br> You're just spoiled.<br> You've thrown everything away.<br> I told you not to bring her<br> up that way. Would you listen?<br> Don't run to me now.<br> I got my hands full with Grandpa.<br> Oh, shut up, Grandma.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I should think you would.<br> If you'd washed her mouth out<br> with soap when she was little...<br> I'm simply suggesting that we all<br> try to enjoy each other...<br> ...without having to assign blame.<br> Listen to Miss Snooty Britches,<br> "assign blame. "<br> Come on!<br> - What're you doing?<br> - Moving you to the waiting room.<br> No need to shove! I'm going!<br> You need a good pop on the butt<br> like I used to give your mother!<br> Yap, yap, yap, yap.<br> If I thought I made you feel<br> like that, I'd kill myself.<br> Don't say that, even in jest.<br> Particularly in a hospital,<br> people might take it wrong.<br> I suppose she means well.<br> She sounds like the voice in your head<br> that tells you you can't do anything.<br> It's true, isn't it?<br> Where'd you go to?<br> Looping. But I shouldn't have<br> left like that. I'm sorry.<br> You don't really think I don't<br> want you to do well?<br> No, Ma.<br> And you were right about that guy.<br> I'm right about your doing<br> that music video too.<br> Just wait and see. That's where<br> your big success will be.<br> It's blood.<br> Blood on my wig, on my clothes.<br> All my makeup's come off.<br> Do I have any eyebrows left?<br> Some, I think.<br> They're not all rubbed off.<br> - I hate not having eyebrows.<br> - I know.<br> Since the studio shaved them,<br> they never grew back.<br> Come on, let's put<br> some makeup on you now.<br> Makeup?<br> Are you less mad at me?<br> I've always been<br> less mad at you, Mama.<br> Remember when I was little, you'd<br> write notes to the school saying:<br> " Please excuse Suzanne<br> from morning classes.<br> She has insomnia<br> and needs to get some sleep. "<br> When you were sick,<br> I'd sing you that little song.<br> Little drops of water<br> Little grains of sand<br> Make the mighty ocean<br> And the pleasant land<br> You know, dear?<br> I think I'm...<br> I think I'm sort of...<br> ...jealous of you.<br> And that is because, well...<br> ...it being your turn and all.<br> I think I find it tough to face...<br> ...that mine is almost up.<br> It's real important to enjoy<br> your turn.<br> And it would help me a lot<br> if I knew...<br> ...that one of us enjoyed our youth.<br> Let me see my mirror.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Look at this.<br> I don't mind getting old.<br> I never thought I'd live this long.<br> What I do mind is looking old.<br> My eyebrow pencil, okay?<br> Here.<br> You know, it's in my will...<br> ...that they don't bury me<br> without eyebrows.<br> I do not go in the ground<br> without them.<br> I know.<br> Should I have liposuction?<br> Like under here?<br> There's press out there, Mama.<br> I figured. The Enquirer.<br> The Star. Variety.<br> " Doris Mann in drunken brawl<br> with tree. "<br> " Doris Mann...<br> ...still distraught over divorce<br> from Tony Vale 25 years ago...<br> ...attempts suicide with lethal oak. "<br> How do I look?<br> Not bad for an old-timer, huh?<br> I'll say.<br> Hand me a coat.<br> " Never let them see you ache. "<br> That's what Mr. Mayer used to say.<br> Or was it "ass"?<br> " Never let them see your ass. "<br> Anyway, you know what my mother<br> said to me yesterday?<br> She said that I put on airs.<br> That I use big words like<br> "gesture" and "devastate. "<br> I don't think they're so big, do you?<br> What am I supposed to do, sound like<br> a hick just to make her happy?<br> And the farmer hauled<br> Another load away<br> Well, compared to the end of the world.<br> Let's go get them, baby.<br> Seems like it takes a crisis<br> to bring us together lately.<br> Like war buddies.<br> Sid speaks!<br> Don't laugh, dear.<br> The man is also a dynamo in bed.<br> Still waters, you know.<br> My scarf. Where's my...?<br> Oh, I'm wearing it.<br> - We should get a family rate here.<br> - At least.<br> She seems to be feeling a lot better.<br> We're designed more for public<br> than for private.<br> Did you ever get my flowers?<br> - You're the guy!<br> - I pumped your stomach.<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, God, I'm really...<br> Well, thanks for the flowers<br> and everything.<br> How you doing with the drugs?<br> I want to do them all the time.<br> That's not unusual.<br> It sometimes never goes away.<br> How you talk.<br> But have you done any?<br> Almost.<br> Sometimes I want to so bad I have<br> to put my head down till it passes.<br> I just go to an AA meeting.<br> In fact...<br> ...I should.<br> Would you like to go to a movie<br> with me sometime?<br> Okay. We could go see<br> Valley of the Dolls.<br> We can say fate brought us together.<br> Fate and too many painkillers.<br> Always my favourite combination.<br> Thanks.<br> But it can't be a "date" date.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because...<br> Because I'm not...<br> ...ready.<br> Oh, okay.<br> I understand that.<br> I'll wait.<br> What are your plans for the future?<br> To go on drinking.<br> We're gonna try one.<br> Please don't go over your marks.<br> Let's go to number one, please.<br> Let's clang the bell, please.<br> - Can we watch from here?<br> - No, they're working here.<br> I want you to see it.<br> I'll see it.<br> Marker.<br> End mark!<br>
