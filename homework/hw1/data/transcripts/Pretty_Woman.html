A very intense<br> young man named David.<br> - Plays polo.<br> - Look, I gotta say this again.<br> I don't like you going alone.<br> I just think it would be better<br> if you went with a date.<br> Keep it social.<br> Edward? Did you hear me?<br> - Yes, I'm here.<br> - What is that?<br> Housekeeping is singing.<br> - I know a lot of nice girls.<br> - No, you don't.<br> Besides, I already have one.<br> You just concentrate on finding out<br> what Morse is up to.<br> I'm on my way.<br> Yeah, baby.<br> Don't you just love Prince?<br> - More than life itself.<br> - Don't you knock?<br> I have a business proposition for you.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.<br> I'd like you<br> to spend the week with me.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, I'd like to hire you<br> as an employee.<br> Would you consider<br> spending the week with me?<br> I will pay you to be<br> at my beck and call.<br> I'd love to be your<br> "beck and call" girl, but...<br> ...you're a rich,<br> good-looking guy.<br> You could get<br> a million girls free.<br> I want a professional.<br> I don't need any<br> romantic hassles this week.<br> If you're talking 24 hours a day,<br> it's gonna cost you.<br> Oh.

It is<br> buried in Appropriations Committee.<br> - It will remain there.<br> - How did you pull that?<br> What do you got... You got dirty<br> politicians in your pockets now?<br> Easy. Calm down, David.<br> Mr. Lewis plays hardball.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I've heard enough.<br> Vivian, it was a pleasure.<br> I'm sorry, Grandfather.<br> I've got to get some air.<br> Mr. Lewis.<br> I'd better join my grandson.<br> You two enjoy your dinner.<br> I'm sure it will be delicious.<br> Good luck, miss.<br> Watch out, Lewis.<br> I'm gonna tear you apart.<br> I look forward to it, sir.<br> You said you never<br> come out here.<br> Well, I'm only halfway out.<br> You didn't say much in the car<br> on the way home.<br> You thinking about dinner?<br> I was a maniac.<br> I mean, the business<br> was good, I think.<br> He's in trouble.<br> You want his company.<br> He doesn't want to let it go.<br> Thanks for the recap.<br> Problem is,<br> I think you like Mr. Morse.<br> What I would like<br> is for you to get down.<br> - Come down.<br> - It's making you nervous?<br> What if I just lean back like this?<br> Would you rescue me if I fell?<br> I'm serious.<br> I'm not looking.<br> It's really high.<br> Look, no hands.<br> OK.<br> All right, I'm sorry.<br> The truth is,<br> it really is totally irrelevant<br> whether I like this man or not.<br> I will not let myself become<br> emotionally involved in business.<br> I know.<br> Kit's always saying to me,<br> "Don't get emotional<br> when you turn tricks."<br> That's why no kissing.<br> It's too personal.<br> Like what you're saying.<br> Stay numb, don't get involved.<br> When I'm with a guy,<br> I'm like a robot. I just do it.<br> I mean... except with you.<br> Of course, not with me.<br> You and I are such<br> similar creatures.<br> We both screw people for money.<br> I'm sorry to hear<br> about your dad.<br> - When did he die?<br> - Last month.<br> Do you miss him?<br> I hadn't spoken to him<br> in 14 and a half years.<br> I wasn't there when he died.<br> - Do you want to talk about this?<br> - No.<br> Well, I'll tell you what.<br> Cos I got an idea.<br> Let's watch old movies all night.<br> We'll just veg out<br> in front of the TV.<br> - "Veg out"?<br> - Yeah.<br> Be still like vegetables.<br> Lay like broccoli.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> I'll be back.<br> We'll do broccoli tomorrow.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Downstairs for awhile.<br> Did you say marriage license?<br> Don't change the subject.<br> Just give me the stamp.<br> I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian,<br> whatever your name is.<br> Oh, I love you.<br> Hi.

That's good.<br> What does she sell?<br> Why do you want to know?<br> Just hear me out on this, OK?<br> I've known you a long time.<br> I see some differences in you<br> this week, like the tie...<br> I'm wondering if this girl<br> is the difference.<br> Especially when I see her<br> talking to David Morse.<br> I introduced them<br> the other night.<br> So now they're best friends?<br> This girl appears from nowhere.<br> Now she's talking to this guy.<br> That's a little convenient,<br> don't you think?<br> How do you know she hasn't<br> attached herself to you<br> and is bringing<br> information to Morse?<br> This happens.<br> Industrial espionage.<br> Listen to me.<br> She's not a spy.<br> She is a hooker.<br> She is a hooker.<br> I picked her up<br> on Hollywood Boulevard.<br> In your car.<br> Yes.<br> You're the only millionaire<br> I've heard of<br> who goes looking for<br> a bargain-basement streetwalker.<br> I'm sorry I told you.<br> Senator Adams,<br> I'm pleased you could make it.<br> I hope the information<br> I gave you was helpful.<br> Absolutely.<br> There's no change in it, is there?<br> No, it's still bogged down.<br> - Having a nice time?<br> - Yeah, I'm having a great time.<br> Must be quite a change<br> from Hollywood Boulevard.<br> What?<br> Edward told me.<br> Don't worry. Your secret<br> is safe with me.<br> Listen, maybe...<br> ...you and I could get together<br> sometime after Edward leaves.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Why not?<br> We'll just have to do that.<br> I'd like to mention our sponsors,<br> Jacobs Distributors,<br> Norell Saddlery,<br> and we'd like to give a big thanks<br> to our platinum sponsor,<br> Edward Lewis Enterprises.<br> The ball is in<br> for chukker number four.<br> - You all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> Fine? That's good.<br> Seven "fines" since<br> we left the match.<br> Could I have<br> another word, please?<br> Arsehole. There's a word.<br> I think I liked "fine" better.<br> Just tell me one thing.<br> Why'd you make me<br> get all dressed up?<br> For one thing,<br> the clothing was appropriate.<br> No. What I mean is, if you were gonna<br> tell everybody I'm a hooker,<br> - why didn't you let me wear my clothes?<br> - I did not...<br> In my own clothes, when someone<br> like Stuckey comes up to me,<br> I can handle it,<br> I'm prepared.<br> I'm very sorry. I'm not happy<br> with Stuckey at all<br> for saying that or doing that.<br> But he is my attorney.<br> I've known him for ten years.<br> He thought you were an industrial spy.<br> The guy's paranoid.<br> Are you my pimp now?<br> You think you can pass me around<br> your friends? I'm not some toy.<br> You're not my toy.<br> I know you're not...<br> I'm speaking to you.<br> Come back here.<br> I hate to point out the obvious,<br> but you are a hooker.<br> - You are my employee.<br> - You don't own me. I decide.<br> I say who, I say when,<br> I say who!<br> I refuse to spend the next three days<br> fighting with you. I said I was sorry.<br> That's the end of it.<br> I'm sorry I ever met you.<br> I'm sorry I ever got<br> into your stupid car.<br> As if you had so many more<br> appealing options.<br> I've never had anyone make me<br> feel as cheap as you did today.<br> Somehow I find that<br> very hard to believe.<br> Where are you going?<br> I want my money.<br> I want to get out of here.<br> Come on.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I wasn't prepared to answer<br> questions about us.<br> That was stupid and cruel.<br> I didn't mean it.<br> I don't want you to go.<br> Will you stay the week?<br> Why?<br> I saw you talking<br> to David Morse.<br> I didn't like it.<br> We were just talking.<br> I didn't like it.<br> Down?<br> You hurt me.<br> Yes.<br> Don't do it again.<br> The first guy I ever loved<br> was a total nothing.<br> The second was worse.<br> My mom called me<br> a "bum magnet".<br> If there was a bum<br> within 50 miles,<br> I was completely<br> attracted to him.<br> That's how I ended up here.<br> I followed bum number three.<br> So, here I was.<br> No money, no friends.<br> No bum.<br> And you chose this<br> as your profession?<br> I worked at a couple<br> of fast-food places.<br> Parked cars at wrestling.<br> I couldn't make the rent.<br> I was too ashamed to go home.<br> That's when I met Kit.<br> She was a hooker<br> and made it sound so great.<br> So one day I did it.<br> And I cried the whole time.<br> But then I got<br> some regulars, and...<br> You know, it's not like anybody<br> plans this. It's not...<br> ...your childhood dream.<br> You could be so much more.<br> People put you down enough,<br> you start to believe it.<br> I think you are very bright.<br> A very special woman.<br> The bad stuff<br> is easier to believe.<br> You ever notice that?<br> I don't want to talk to him.<br> I'll call him Monday.<br> - Did he sign this?<br> - No, he has to leave.<br> - You can't disappear. We're too deep.<br> - Don't panic.<br> Morse isn't going anywhere.<br> I'll be back.<br> Did you send the tickets<br> to the hotel?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I have a date.<br> With the hooker?<br> Be careful, Philip.<br> Do I look OK?<br> Something's missing.<br> Well, nothin' else is gonna fit<br> into this dress.<br> Maybe something<br> in this box.<br> I don't want you to get too excited.<br> It's only on loan.<br> They let you borrow this<br> from the jewellery store?<br> I'm a very good customer.<br> If you buy this,<br> how much would it cost?<br> A quarter of a million.<br> A quarter of a million dollars?<br> So where are we going?<br> It's a surprise.<br> If I forget to tell you later,<br> I had a really good time tonight.<br> Thank you.<br> When you're not fidgeting,<br> you look beautiful.<br> And very tall.<br> You want to go to<br> San Francisco this evening?<br> I've never been on a plane.<br> - How'd you get to LA?<br> - Bus.<br> Well, it should be<br> a pretty smooth flight.<br> The weather's clear<br> to San Francisco.<br> We should be there<br> in about 50 minutes.<br> - We're late.<br> - No, it's all right.<br> - Opening night never starts on time.<br> - OK.<br> - Programme, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Right this way.<br> - Doris. Nice to see you.<br> - How are you, Edward?<br> - Sir.<br> - Evening.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Come here and look.<br> It's all right.<br> I've already seen it.<br> If you're afraid,<br> why do you sit up here?<br> Because they're the best.<br> - Is there anything else?<br> - No, thank you.<br> The glasses are there.<br> Enjoy the opera.<br> So, you said<br> this is in Italian.<br> How am I gonna know what they're saying?<br> These are broken.<br> - Mine are broken.<br> - That's OK. It's all right.<br> You'll know.<br> You'll understand.<br> The music's very powerful.<br> There's a band.<br> People's reactions to opera the first<br> time they see it is very dramatic.<br> They either love it<br> or they hate it.<br> If they love it, they will<br> always love it. If they don't...<br> ...they may learn<br> to appreciate it,<br> but it will never become<br> part of their soul.<br> Bravo!<br> Did you enjoy the opera, dear?<br> Oh, it was so good<br> I almost peed my pants.<br> What?<br> She said she liked it better<br> than Pirates of Penzance.<br> I moved the queen.<br> I like the queen.<br> You can't move the queen.<br> Do you really<br> want to do that?<br> Why don't we finish this tomorrow?<br> I have to work.<br> Why don't you not go to work tomorrow?<br> Take the day off.<br> Me not work?<br> Yeah.<br> I do own the company.<br> Here are the storage reports you wanted.<br> And Mr. Lewis called.<br> What'd he say?<br> He said he's taking the day off.<br> - He's taking the day off?<br> - That's what he said.<br> I'm starving.<br> There's a Snap Dog vendor.<br> Do you have any money?<br> I have money.<br> I don't know what a Snap Dog is.<br> I'm gonna...<br> You'll buy a Snap Dog.<br> We'll cop a squat<br> under a tree somewhere.<br> - Cop a what?<br> - Cop a squat.<br> All right,<br> read the first two pages.<br> OK.<br> I was talking to someone.<br> He sleeps.<br> I love you.<br> What are you thinking about,<br> sitting by yourself?<br> The fact that this will be<br> our last night together.<br> Then you'll finally<br> be rid of me.<br> Well, you've been<br> pretty tough to take.<br> My business is almost over,<br> so I'll be going to New York.<br> I'd really like<br> to see you again.<br> - You would?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, I would.<br> I've arranged for you to have<br> an apartment, have a car,<br> have a wide variety of stores<br> that'll suck up to you<br> anytime you want to go shopping.<br> Everything's done.<br> What else?<br> You gonna leave some money by the bed<br> when you pass through?<br> It really wouldn't be like that.<br> How would it be?<br> For one thing,<br> it'd get you off the streets.<br> That's just geography.<br> What is it you want?<br> - What do you see happening between us?<br> - I don't know.<br> When I was a little girl,<br> my mama used to lock me in the attic<br> when I was bad, which was pretty often.<br> And I would...<br> I would pretend<br> I was a princess,<br> trapped in a tower<br> by a wicked queen.<br> And then, suddenly, this knight<br> on a white horse, with these colours<br> flying, would come charging up<br> and draw his sword,<br> and I would wave.<br> And he would climb up the tower<br> and rescue me.<br> But never, in all the time...<br> ...that I had this dream<br> did the knight say to me,<br> "Come on, baby.<br> I'll put you up in a great condo".<br> - Yes.<br> - I had to call.<br> I just got off the phone<br> with Morse. Get this.<br> He wants to meet<br> with you. Today.<br> - Why?<br> - He wouldn't say.<br> We got him.<br> His nuts are on the block.<br> We got him.<br> He's really caving in.<br> I want him to commit his stocks<br> to us this afternoon.<br> It's no good. If he's really<br> caving in, I don't want to wait.<br> Have Morse meet me downtown<br> this morning. Goodbye.<br> I have to go now.<br> I want you to understand.<br> I heard everything you said.<br> This is all<br> I'm capable of right now.<br> It's a very big step for me.<br> I know.<br> It's a really good offer<br> for a girl like me.<br> I've never treated you<br> like a prostitute.<br> You just did.<br> Yes, Barnard Thompson here,<br> Miss Vivian.<br> Could you come<br> to the front desk?<br> There's someone here<br> who wants to speak to you.<br> - Her name is Miss De Luca.<br> - Let me talk to her.<br> Let me just talk to her.<br> Yo, babe,<br> would you come down here?<br> The sphincter police<br> won't let me through.<br> - OK. She's on her way.<br> - Fine.<br> - Mr. Thompson?<br> - Yes.<br> The window washer<br> is refusing to come down.<br> It's a Saturday.<br> Wait here, please. Watch her.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Fifty bucks, grandpa.<br> For 75, the wife can watch.<br> I've been calling you.<br> Yeah, they told me<br> at the Banana.<br> - You were supposed to come Tuesday.<br> - I was hiding from Carlos.<br> If you picked up the money,<br> you wouldn't have to.<br> I was busy. I had a life.<br> Nino got beat up.<br> I had to visit him in the hospital.<br> Rachel got arrested.<br> Anyway, I got the money.<br> Thank you for saving my arse.<br> Now Carlos can get off it.<br> He was talking about you last night.<br> He'd bust something<br> if he saw you in this outfit.<br> I was afraid to hug you.<br> I might wrinkle you.<br> You look really good.<br> No, something with shade.<br> You clean up real nice.<br> You sure don't fit in on the boulevard,<br> not that you ever did.<br> Well, thanks.<br> It's easy to clean up<br> when you got money.<br> Yeah.<br> - So, when does he leave?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> - You get to keep the clothes?<br> - Yeah.<br> Edward asked me<br> if I wanted to see him again.<br> But I think, definitely no.<br> I mean, it's just<br> another week, right?<br> Definitely no?<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, no.<br> What?<br> - I know this weepy look on your face.<br> - No, you don't.<br> - You fell in love with him.<br> - No. Please stop it.<br> You've fallen in love with him?<br> Did you kiss him? On the mouth?<br> - Yeah, I did.<br> - You kissed him on the mouth?<br> - It was nice.<br> - You fall in love and kiss him?<br> - Did I not teach you anything?<br> - I'm not stupid, OK?<br> I'm not in love with him.<br> I just... I like him.<br> - You like him?<br> - Yeah.<br> You definitely like him?<br> Well, he's not a bum.<br> He's a rich, classy guy.<br> Who's gonna break<br> my heart, right?<br> Oh, no. Come on.<br> You don't know that.<br> Hey, he asked you, right?<br> Maybe you guys could like...<br> ...you know, get a house<br> and buy some diamonds and a horse.<br> I don't know.<br> Anyway...<br> ...it could work.<br> It happens.<br> When does it happen?<br> When? Who does it<br> really work out for?<br> Did it work out<br> for Skinny Marie or Rachel?<br> Those were very specific cases<br> of crackheads.<br> I just want to know<br> who it works out for.<br> Give me one example<br> of someone we know<br> - that it happened for.<br> - Name someone?<br> - Like, give you a name?<br> - Yeah, I'd like a name.<br> God, the pressure of a name.<br> Cinda-fuckin'-rella.<br> Mr. Morse, you said you wished<br> to speak to Mr. Lewis.<br> Mr. Lewis is listening.<br> I've reconsidered my position<br> on your acquisition offer.<br> On one condition:<br> I'm not so concerned<br> about me, but...<br> ...the people who work for me.<br> No problem.<br> They'll be taken care of.<br> Now, if we could<br> address ourselves<br> - to the contracts in front of you...<br> - Excuse me.<br> Gentlemen, I'd like to speak<br> to Mr. Morse alone.<br> Thank you.<br> You heard the man.<br> Please wait outside.<br> You too, Phil.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, I would like to speak<br> to Mr. Morse alone.<br> - Why does he get to stay?<br> - Please.<br> Please.<br> I'll be right outside.<br> Good.<br> - Is that better?<br> - It's all right.<br> - Would you like a cup of coffee?<br> - Black.<br> Mr. Morse...<br> ...my interests in your company<br> have changed.<br> What is it you're after now?<br> Well, I no longer wish to buy<br> your company and take it apart.<br> I don't want<br> anyone else to either.<br> And it is still<br> extremely vulnerable.<br> So I find myself<br> in unfamiliar territory.<br> I want to help you.<br> Why?<br> I think we can do something<br> very special with your company.<br> What about our Navy contracts?<br> They weren't dead.<br> Just delayed.<br> I bluffed a little bit.<br> - You're very good at it.<br> - Thank you very much. It's my job.<br> I think we can leave the details<br> up to the others.<br> I find this hard to say without<br> sounding condescending, but...<br> ...I'm proud of you.<br> Thank you.<br> I think we can let in<br> the other suits now.<br> Let's continue the meeting.<br> Come in, gentlemen.<br> Sit down.<br> Please, what was this all about?<br> It's all yours.<br> Finish it up.<br> Hold it.<br> These aren't signed.<br> Can someone please tell me<br> what the fuck is going on?<br> Mr. Lewis and I are<br> going to build ships together.<br> Great big ships.<br> I think I'm going to go for a walk.<br> Just stay here awhile.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, well.<br> Hello again.<br> I'm looking for Edward.<br> Edward's not here.<br> I thought he was with you.<br> No.<br> Edward is definitely<br> not "with me".<br> No. If Edward were with me...<br> When, actually...<br> When Edward was with me,<br> he didn't blow off<br> billion-dollar deals.<br> I think that Edward's with you,<br> that's what I think.<br> - Mind if I have a drink?<br> - No.<br> No, thank you.<br> Well.<br> I'll just wait.<br> Edward will be back soon.<br> Any minute, he'll be home.<br> You know...<br> ...this is not home.<br> This is a hotel room.<br> And you are not...<br> ...the little woman.<br> You're a hooker.<br> Maybe you're a very good hooker.<br> Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care<br> about losing millions of dollars.<br> Because I have to be very honest<br> with you right now.<br> Right now, I really do care.<br> I really do.<br> And right now,<br> I am really pissed, you know?<br> Right now I am just<br> freaking out.<br> So maybe<br> if I screw you...<br> ...and take you to the opera,<br> then I can be happy.<br> Hey! Get off me!<br> Goddamn it!<br> - Come on! I'm gonna...<br> - Get off me!<br> - Is this 20 bucks? 30 bucks?<br> - Get off me!<br> - You a fifty-dollar whore?<br> - What are you doing?
