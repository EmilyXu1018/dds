                        1<br> On my first day of law school,<br> my professor says two things.<br> First, "From this day forward,<br> when your mother says she loves you,<br> - "get a second opinion."<br> - And?<br> "If you want justice,<br> go to a whorehouse.<br> "If you want to get fucked, go to court."<br> Naomi!<br> Let's say you have a client<br> who you know is guilty...<br> No, don't even start with that.<br> Our justice system doesn't care<br> about that, and neither do I.<br> Every defendant, no matter who he is,<br> regardless of what he's done,<br> has the right to the best defense<br> his attorney can provide. Period.<br> - So where were you with the truth?<br> - Truth?<br> - How do you mean? Naomi!<br> - Coming.<br> I'm not sure how many ways<br> there are to mean it.<br> You think there's only one?<br> - I can't do this.<br> - You're late.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - Okay.<br> Actually, you're right, you know.<br> - There is only one that matters.<br> - Marty, hold still, please.<br> My version of it,<br> the one I create in the minds of those<br> 12 men and women sitting on a jury.<br> Now, if you want to,<br> you can call it something else.<br> The... The illusion of truth, if you want.<br> It's up to you.<br> - Good. Yeah.<br> - Yeah?<br> Jack, is that it?<br> You need some more stuff?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Tomorrow afternoon?<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right, I'll have my secretary set it up.<br> Okay.<br> - This is a cover story, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah. Okay, bye.<br> Saint Michael's Boys Choir.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> - What a talented group.<br> - Tell you after.<br> - Sure.<br> - Right now, ladies and gentlemen,<br> we're gonna have a brief photo session<br> while we have the boys here<br> with His Excellency.<br> I'll be back in a few minutes.<br> Please bear with us,<br> enjoy your dessert and thank you.<br> - Yes.<br> - Here we go. Okay.<br> Good, good.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Thanks.<br> Marty. What an unexpected surprise.<br> Well, I'm here to help<br> our friendly prosecutor off the hook.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - What's it gonna cost?<br> - A lot less than the alternative.<br> - Tomorrow at my office, 9:30.<br> - Is this on? Yes, it is.<br> - Your Excellency. Nice to see you again.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, we have come<br> to the heart of the matter,<br> the reason we've all<br> gathered together here tonight.<br> This is the fifth straight year<br> that it's been my privilege<br> to serve as your master of ceremonies<br> for The Chicago Bar Association<br> and Catholic Charities Ball.<br> I'm afraid<br> you're gonna have to put that out.<br> It's a bar, for Christ's sake.<br> Tonight, due to your generous efforts,<br> we've broken last year's record<br> in terms of attendees and the amount<br> - of money raised for the Archbishop's...<br> - I thought you quit.<br> - ...charity, and I think that deserves...<br> - I cut down.<br> ...a big round of applause.<br> - You look beautiful. Cut your hair?<br> - Yeah. A few months ago.<br> And now, as it has been my pleasure<br> for the last four years...<br> - Want to dance?<br> - There isn't any music.<br> Sure there is.<br> ...longtime State's Attorney,<br> God love him, Mr. John Shaughnessy.<br> Thank you very much,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> - and my personal thanks...<br> - Come on.<br> All you have to do is turn around.<br> I thought you liked it better like this.<br> That way you don't have to look<br> at the person.<br> Mean.<br> Considering the hour, I'll try to keep...<br> Look at me.<br> First of all, I want to thank all of you<br> for coming out tonight<br> to support the Archbishop...<br> Come on, let's go find a bar<br> you can still smoke in.<br> Thanks for the invite,<br> but I don't like one-night stands<br> all that much.<br> - We saw each other for months.<br> - It was a one-night stand, Marty.<br> It just lasted six months.<br> Thank you, John.<br> Well, I must say<br> I haven't seen this many lawyers<br> and politicians<br> gathered together in one place<br> since confession this morning.<br> There is no way<br> the People are gonna tolerate<br> a monetary award to a cockroach<br> who deserves 20 to life.<br> He may be your client,<br> but Joey Pinero is a hard-case felon.<br> Dealing, racketeering,<br> - money-laundering, attempted murder.<br> - Did you say "alleged," Yancy?<br> I didn't hear you say...<br> Did you hear him say "alleged"?<br> Mr. Pinero has never been<br> convicted of anything.<br> Cops jumped him,<br> left him bleeding in the snow.<br> It's a miracle he survived.<br> Having said that,<br> I'm not opposed to a settlement.<br> 1 .5 million, and Pinero leaves the state.<br> You can't limit a citizen's right to live<br> wherever he wants to.<br> Legally, that's unenforceable.<br> Whether or not it's enforceable<br> or just a gentlemen's agreement,<br> Mr. Pinero will know what we want.<br> Get the answer you're looking for.<br> Don't sit around and chat.<br> It's been a pleasure.<br> You're worse than the fucking thugs<br> you represent.<br> That's enough, Bud. It's over.<br> - Obviously, I've got to run this by him.<br> - You're on 40 % commission, Marty.<br> I have nothing but confidence<br> your recommendation will prevail.<br> Thank you, John.<br> My hand!<br> Oh, shit.<br> - Hey.<br> - Mr. Vail.<br> How you doing?<br> Nice tune.<br> So, what'd they say?<br> Take it or leave it all for 1.5 million.<br> From Shaughnessy himself.<br> What do you think?<br> I think we should take it,<br> unless you want to spend<br> the next two years of your life<br> tied up in appellate court.<br> - No, fuck that. Close it.<br> - Done.<br> Okay.<br> Your shot.<br> There's one more little thing.<br> They want you...<br> They want you to leave the state.<br> - They want you to disappear.<br> - Disappear?<br> - That's good. Same bullshit, right?<br> - What? What are you talking about?<br> I keep getting these offers<br> from these guys, Marty.<br> What offers?<br> Well, a couple of months ago,<br> a cop walks in here.<br> He says,<br> "You testify against Alderman Martinez,<br> "and we'll owe you, Joey.<br> "Say he did you favors,<br> say he's on your payroll,"<br> shit like that, right?<br> So I tell him to go fuck himself.<br> Why? Because Martinez is a good man.<br> He's the only one holding out<br> while the others try to turn South River<br> into high-rent condos.<br> - Why didn't you tell me this before?<br> - Why?<br> 'Cause this shit happens every day.<br> I didn't think it had anything<br> to do with this.<br> - You don't?<br> - Hey.<br> I've spent a lot of money in this place.<br> - They've spent a lot more, a lot more.<br> - I built a clinic here.<br> - These people depend on me.<br> - I don't give a shit.<br> Send them checks from California.<br> I respect your advice, Marty,<br> but I can't take it.<br> I'll take the money,<br> but I ain't going anywhere.<br> - This is my home.<br> - I don't like it, Joey.<br> - So what are they gonna do, kill me?<br> - They tried once.<br> How are they going to kill a man<br> who never sleeps?<br> - Get the money.<br> - You're too much.<br> - Hey.<br> - Yeah.<br> That song you like? Fourth cut.<br> - Very nice, thank you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Christ, we got enough<br> fucking cops here?<br> No doubt, the police are gonna have<br> their hands full with this one.<br> Captain Stenner,<br> can you tell us anything right now?<br> I don't know anything. I just got here.<br> Captain Stenner,<br> can you tell us what's going on?<br> Andy, I haven't seen anything yet.<br> As soon as I go inside,<br> I'll come out and tell you, okay?<br> All right.<br> You should be home in bed, Abel.<br> It's going around.<br> I'll consider that, Harvey.<br> - Christ.<br> - What a mess, huh?<br> Sam, you got all you need?<br> Okay, gently roll him over.<br> Police! Stop!<br> Right thumb and forefinger severed.<br> Symbol "B32.156"<br> is carved into the chest.<br> - Body temperature, still warm.<br> - Captain, we got a live one on the run.<br> You can see now, a passing train<br> has separated the fleeing suspect...<br> You want to know what I hate?<br> I'll tell you what I hate.<br> I hate when they go on and on<br> about what big fucking whores<br> the defense attorneys are.<br> ...the suspect is headed into the train...<br> We're the bad guys. You know why?<br> 'Cause we're always sitting<br> next to some creep,<br> we start to look creepy, you know?<br> Plus, they assume they're guilty.<br> You know, they assume they did it,<br> and, like, we know or something.<br> You don't know.<br> You don't ask. You don't care.<br> You do the goddamn job.<br> It's not like they're your friends,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> ...there's no telling<br> where the suspect may have gone...<br> Well, some are your friends, but...<br> So, why'd you leave<br> the State's Attorney's Office?<br> Dead-end job.<br> You either... You either run for office,<br> or you end up a judge.<br> Why become an umpire<br> when you can play ball?<br> ...continue to pour into the area<br> around Saint Michael's<br> and the Archbishop's mansion.<br> Over here! He's over here!<br> We will, of course,<br> stay with this shocking story<br> as it continues to unfold<br> throughout the day.<br> Now, what we do know right now<br> is that at approximately 11:08<br> this morning, this...<br> So, when did you know you had them?<br> Now, at this hour, the scene<br> at Saint Michael's is crowded...<br> - What? Sorry.<br> - Was there a moment<br> during the Pinero trial<br> when you said to yourself,<br> "I've got them"?<br> The day I took the case. Excuse me.<br> ...the shocking murder this morning<br> of one of Chicago's<br> most beloved figures,<br> Archbishop Richard Rushman,<br> has left the city just numb.<br> Okay, I understand we have Andy live.<br> Let's go to Andy.<br> Diann, we have just learned<br> that Chicago police have arrested<br> a 19-year-old man<br> tentatively identified as Aaron Stampler.<br> Now, according<br> to Captain Abel Stenner...<br> We're gonna have to reschedule.<br> Call my office, okay? I'm sorry.<br> ...underneath McCormick Place<br> just minutes after the murder...<br> ...through cold-blooded savagery, a<br> beacon of hope has been taken from us.<br> Law offices of Martin Vail.<br> - You got the news on, by any chance?<br> - Yeah, we're watching it.<br> All right, I want you to call Sullivan<br> in Judge Trotter's office.<br> Find out where they took him,<br> and call me right back.<br> I'm at The Alibi.<br> - A lot of guys are gonna want this one.<br> - Okay.<br> The police have taken the first steps,<br> acting with speed and determination<br> with the arrest.<br> Are you taking the Stampler case?<br> Andy, I'm sorry.<br> I can't talk to you about anything.<br> Thank you very much.<br> When are you gonna talk?<br> - State's Attorney left yet?<br> - Yeah. Yancy, no less.<br> - Yeah? P.D.?<br> - Come and gone. Lockup!<br> - Give my best to your brother.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> I'd like to see him alone, if I could.<br> All right,<br> but I'm gonna have to lock you in.<br> Understood.<br> You know who I am?<br> Well, no. No, sir. No, I don't.<br> My name is Martin Vail.<br> I'm what you call a big-shot attorney.<br> I don't... I don't have no money.<br> No, I didn't think you did.<br> I'm willing to take your case pro bono,<br> which means you get all of my expertise<br> and hard work for free.<br> Or, if you want to,<br> you could get the $40,000-a-year,<br> court-appointed public defender,<br> who will almost certainly<br> escort you personally to death row.<br> Your choice.<br> No. No, sir. I...<br> I'd surely be grateful<br> for anything you could do for me.<br> You're welcome.<br> Now, your full name is?<br> My... Aaron Luke Stampler.<br> Stampler.<br> - You from Kentucky, Aaron?<br> - Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.<br> Does it say that there?<br> How long you been here in Chicago?<br> Well, two years next month, I think.<br> - Have you ever been arrested?<br> - No. No, sir.<br> So how do you know the Archbishop?<br> I was begging on the street<br> up on Wacker Drive,<br> Bishop Rushman came by<br> in his Cadillac.<br> He saw me, and he stopped.<br> He took me into Savior House.<br> I work as an altar boy.<br> I sing in his choir.<br> How long were you there<br> at Savior House?<br> Year, year and a half.<br> You're supposed to leave<br> when you're 18,<br> but Bishop Rushman let me stay on<br> way past my 19th birthday.<br> That was nice of him.<br> Yes. Yes, it was.<br> Aaron, did you have any reason<br> to dislike the Archbishop?<br> Dislike? No. No, sir.<br> He was like a father to me.<br> Yeah, but you...<br> How do I say this? Were...<br> Were you in the room<br> when he was murdered?<br> How can you explain that?<br> There was someone else<br> in that room, Mr. Vail.<br> - There was a third person?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Did you tell the police this?<br> Yes. Yes, I did,<br> but they didn't believe me.<br> All right. Well, you tell me now.<br> I was returning a book<br> to Bishop Rushman's library.<br> I heard noise, so I went back into his...<br> In his bedroom.<br> Bishop Rushman was laying<br> on the floor.<br> There was blood all over everything.<br> And then I seen a shadow. I seen<br> a person leaning over Bishop Rushman.<br> He looked up and then he came at me,<br> and that's when I lost time.<br> What does that mean, "lost time"?<br> I blacked out.<br> It just... It happens to me sometimes.<br> I just... I have spells.<br> I have spells. I lose time. I can't...<br> I can't remember nothing.<br> Why did you run from the police, Aaron,<br> if you didn't do anything wrong?<br> Well, when...<br> When I woke up, I was covered in blood.<br> I didn't know what to do.<br> I got scared. I heard sirens, so I ran.<br> Look, I know how it looks, Mr. Vail,<br> but I swear...<br> Yeah, I don't need you<br> to try to convince me, Aaron.<br> I just want you to answer my questions.<br> But I didn't do this.<br> You've got to believe me.<br> No, I don't have to believe you.<br> I don't care.<br> I'm your attorney,<br> which means I am your mother,<br> your father, best friend and your priest.<br> In other words, I don't want you talking<br> to anyone but me from now on.<br> Not the cops, not the press,<br> not the other guys in the cells here,<br> nobody without my permission,<br> you understand? Yeah?<br> - Yes. Yes, I do.<br> - All right.<br> Now the important stuff.<br> What's your suit size?<br> - My what?<br> - Suit size. What, you're about a 38?<br> I don't know.<br> - About a 38 long.<br> - Okay.<br> Stampler was flushed by the police<br> from his hiding place in the bushes<br> behind the cathedral.<br> The police chased him through the train<br> yard, just north of McCormick Place,<br> almost losing him<br> as he scrambled over tracks<br> before an oncoming train,<br> separating him from the police.<br> In a later development,<br> prominent local<br> criminal defense attorney Martin Vail<br> is believed to have visited Stampler<br> at the Maxwell Street Precinct...<br> After a brief chase across the rail yard<br> behind Saint Michael's Cathedral,<br> Stampler was apprehended in a hole<br> beneath train tracks.<br> - Are you gonna defend this man?<br> - Andy, I'm sorry. I can't...<br> Thank you very much. Thank you.<br> We've taken the first step<br> in the process.<br> I can now take your questions.<br> Can you tell us anything<br> about the altar-boy group<br> - that Aaron Stampler was part of?<br> - Not much at this time.<br> Have you ruled out the involvement<br> of any of the other altar boys?<br> We have no reason to suspect anyone<br> other than Stampler.<br> He had access<br> to the Archbishop's quarters.<br> He was caught fleeing the area<br> of Saint Michael's.<br> The blood-soaked Aaron Stampler<br> was chased<br> down under McCormick Place,<br> but not before he was almost killed<br> by a passing train.<br> Law office of Martin Vail.<br> He's gonna call you<br> as soon as he gets in.<br> I know. I promise you.<br> Okay, thank you very much.<br> - Naomi!<br> - Yeah.<br> - Talk to you later. Bye.<br> - Hey.<br> Sorry I'm late. We have a new client.<br> - I was afraid you were gonna say that.<br> - Who?<br> You know what<br> they're calling him already?<br> - The Butcher Boy of Saint Mike's.<br> - I like that.<br> Well, that's good.<br> You're gonna be hearing it a lot.<br> This kid who chopped up<br> the Archbishop, he's our new client?<br> Tommy, you're gonna have to try harder<br> to get the word "allegedly"<br> into your vocabulary,<br> - especially if you want to be a lawyer.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Tommy, you want coffee?<br> - No. No, thanks.<br> All right. He admits he was in the room<br> when the killing occurred,<br> but he didn't actually see it happen.<br> - Can I stop you right there?<br> - No.<br> He was returning a book<br> to the Archbishop.<br> He heard loud noises in the bedroom.<br> He went in. He sees a figure,<br> someone in the shadows<br> kneeling over the body. He blacks out.<br> Next thing he knows,<br> sirens are screaming,<br> he's covered in blood.<br> The cops find him in a train tunnel.<br> He's got the Archbishop's ring<br> in his pocket.<br> He stole the Archbishop's ring?<br> I didn't say that.<br> I said it was in his pocket.<br> Is that it?<br> Yep.<br> That's... That's bullshit, Marty.<br> That's the worst bullshit story<br> I've ever heard in my entire life.<br> Now it's our bullshit story.<br> Okay, let's get to work.<br> Now, the name of the game here<br> is motive,<br> as in, the prosecution doesn't have one.<br> So what we have to do here<br> is prove that someone else<br> could have committed the crime.<br> Then we can establish<br> reasonable doubt.<br> So I want to know everything I can<br> about this guy, everything he was into.<br> We go to database,<br> go to Hall of Records, IRS files.<br> - Even his so-called charities.<br> - So-called?<br> The guy was a priest, for Christ's sake.<br> Naomi, write this down. B-32.156.<br> That was carved<br> into the Archbishop's chest.<br> - Allegedly.<br> - No.<br> That was a fact,<br> but I appreciate the effort, Tommy.<br> Thanks.<br> I also need case histories<br> on murder by stabbing,<br> murder by mutilation,<br> murder by religion.<br> - Also, I'm gonna need a psychiatrist.<br> - You're telling me.<br> And not the kind<br> that lives in a witness box, either.<br> I need a real one this time,<br> and someone who knows<br> about amnesia.<br> - What does he look like in person?<br> - The Butcher Boy?<br> Like a Boy Scout.<br> A Boy Scout<br> with a merit badge in carving.<br> The Archbishop was a close<br> personal friend of Mr. Shaughnessy.<br> He came to me earlier this morning<br> and asked me who was my best man,<br> - I said you.<br> - Thank you.<br> I trust, Mr. Shaughnessy,<br> if I am to prosecute this case,<br> I'll be given the authority<br> which comes with the assignment.<br> You're the one trying the case, but<br> let's establish one thing at the outset.<br> I want the death penalty.<br> I'd like an opportunity<br> to go over the case<br> before we make a determination<br> on whether or not<br> to seek the death penalty.<br> I'm open to anything<br> you have to say, Janet,<br> but in my mind there's no debate.<br> Did he say anything,<br> the boy they picked up?<br> Yeah. He didn't do it.<br> It's a slam dunk, Janet.<br> Excuse me.<br> I appreciate your faith in me,<br> and I don't mean to be argumentative...<br> Hey, that's what we pay you for.<br> ...but if it's as open and shut<br> as you say it is, then you don't need me.<br> The P.D. will plead no contest,<br> throw the kid on the mercy of the court.<br> - There's not a public defender.<br> - He's got a lawyer already? Who?<br> Hey, I'm Martin Vail.<br> I'm defending Aaron Stampler.<br> - I need to inspect the murder site.<br> - The Butcher Boy?<br> Thank you. Yes. I forgot his real name.<br> What's the matter, Marty,<br> lost your faith?<br> Looking for a little religion?<br> Now tell me, Counselor,<br> which one of us<br> is the true headline-chaser here?<br> - Unlike you, I was assigned to this case.<br> - Yeah? Think you're up to it?<br> Sell the book rights yet,<br> or are you gonna wait a while?<br> Want to see some pictures?<br> Come on. They're kind of cute.<br> I think you'll agree they clearly show<br> the heinous nature of the crime.<br> A small piece of advice,<br> don't use the word "heinous"<br> in a courtroom.<br> Half the jury won't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> One small piece of advice,<br> I'm not sitting second chair<br> to you anymore.<br> In case you hadn't noticed, I graduated.<br> - I had no reason to leave.<br> - You had every reason to leave.<br> How can you still work for them?<br> What? You really expect me<br> to trot out after you, Marty?<br> Quit, just because you did?<br> I don't need a Mercedes.<br> I don't need to see my face<br> on the evening news.<br> You knew I was coming here,<br> didn't you?<br> You knew I would defend him.<br> That's why you took the case.<br> You asked Shaughnessy for this,<br> didn't you?<br> Oh, please.<br> What's the matter, Marty, you nervous?<br> Been a while since you rubbed up<br> against a woman with a brain?<br> What is the matter? You tired?<br> You haven't been sleeping well?<br> You're the one<br> with the score to settle, Marty.<br> I sleep great at night.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> Thanks.<br> - Hey. Where is he?<br> - Over here.<br> All right,<br> we'll be sitting at a table together,<br> along with two of my associates.<br> Now, once the charges are read,<br> the judge is gonna ask you<br> how you plead.<br> - Not guilty.<br> - No.<br> - But I'm not guilty, Mr. Vail.<br> - I don't care. It doesn't matter.<br> You can keep your mouth shut.<br> You don't say anything.<br> Well, you're going to say I'm not guilty.<br> I'll say whatever I say.<br> You don't have to worry about it.<br> - But, Mr. Vail...<br> - This is exactly what I'm talking about.<br> This can't go on in the courtroom,<br> so you might as well get used to it now.<br> I speak. You do not speak.<br> Your job is just to sit there<br> and look innocent.<br> Well, I am innocent.<br> That's it!<br> That's exactly how I want you to look.<br> That's exactly it.<br> Now, can you remember that?<br> Look in the mirror if you have to.<br> That's the look.<br> I don't have to.<br> This is how I always look.<br> Well, then you're way ahead<br> of the game already, aren't you?<br> Don't smile.<br> Don't.<br> Mr. Vail, can we have a statement?<br> No. We're gonna find out<br> what happened here.<br> How can you defend Aaron Stampler<br> in the face of all this public pressure?<br> The only pressure is to find the truth.<br> ...with the Archbishop's blood on him.<br> You've been talking to the police again,<br> haven't you? I told you not to.<br> As usual, they get everything wrong.<br> Come on. How're you gonna explain<br> the fact that<br> he had blood-soaked clothing on him?<br> - We all saw that.<br> - At this juncture,<br> I'm not going to explain it at all.<br> I've only recently been retained<br> in this case.<br> Significant facts are in dispute here<br> and continue to be in dispute.<br> Marty, you're a master at putting<br> the victim on trial<br> to help your own client.<br> That's going to be very difficult<br> in this case.<br> A victim in this case is my client.<br> We have two victims here, no suspects.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Are you worried about his safety, Marty?<br> No. Thank you.<br> It's not a case.<br> I don't think there'll be any question<br> about the verdict.<br> All rise.<br> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.<br> - Bailiff?<br> - State v. Aaron Stampler.<br> Is everyone here? Sit down.<br> Is everyone here?<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> Madam Prosecutor?<br> The State charges the prisoner,<br> Aaron Stampler,<br> with the crime<br> of murder in the first degree.<br> How does your client plead, Counselor?<br> Your Honor, if it pleases the court,<br> I need time to make<br> a complete psychiatric evaluation<br> before any charges<br> are brought against us.<br> State has more than enough evidence<br> to warrant the allegations, Your Honor.<br> I agree. Motion denied.<br> Mr. Stampler,<br> do you understand the charges<br> brought against you?<br> - Yes. Yes, I...<br> - Your Honor, I direct my client<br> not to answer that question<br> on the grounds that his response<br> may tend to incriminate him.<br> The defendant is taking the Fifth<br> on whether or not<br> he understands the charges?<br> Yes, Your Honor. Until we have<br> a complete psychological evaluation,<br> he will be taking the Fifth<br> on any and all questions posed to him.<br> State v. Appleby for your review<br> of precedent.<br> Thank you.<br> No, no, I can't do that. No.<br> What do you want?<br> I'm looking for the room<br> a kid named Aaron Stampler stayed in.<br> - You the police?<br> - I'm his uncle.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Well, hey.<br> - This is Alex's.<br> - Who's Alex?<br> - He's one of the other altar boys.<br> - An altar boy?<br> An altar boy was wearing this?<br> Well, not at the mass.<br> Well, this altar boy attacked<br> a colleague of mine.<br> He hurt him pretty bad.<br> What do you think he was doing there<br> in your room?<br> - My room?<br> - Yeah.<br> I can't... I don't know.<br> - I mean, I don't have nothing.<br> - You know where I could find him?<br> Who? Alex?<br> - No, I don't... I don't know where he is.<br> - You don't?<br> - Who's Linda?<br> - Linda?<br> She your girlfriend?<br> - Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.<br> - I don't know where she is.<br> Why is it that I get this feeling<br> you're not telling me something, Aaron?<br> - I'm telling you the truth.<br> - I don't think so.<br> Are you surprised that Alex<br> attacked my friend?<br> - No. No, I mean, he has a temper.<br> - Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so.<br> Let me ask you this.<br> Do you think it could be Alex<br> who was that figure you saw<br> at the Archbishop's room?<br> - I... Alex? I couldn't be sure.<br> - But it could be him?<br> I don't know.<br> Aaron, you're not understanding this.<br> The State wants you dead.<br> If you don't help me,<br> that's exactly what they're gonna get.<br> I...<br> I'm trying. I can't remember.<br> I don't understand. Why would Alex<br> want to do such a thing?<br> For his own reasons. He...<br> Maybe someone hired him.<br> - Hired by who?<br> - I don't know. Forget it.<br> What I need to know is,<br> do you think he's capable of doing it?<br> I don't know. He...<br> I don't know<br> who's capable of such a thing, Mr. Vail.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Sure.<br> So he claims there was someone else<br> in the room<br> and that he can't remember.<br> And you want me<br> to look into this amnesia question<br> - and see what he actually knows.<br> - Yeah.<br> What if he knows he did it?<br> The major causes of amnesia<br> are substance abuse, seizures,<br> head injuries and malingering.<br> I think the kid's telling the truth.<br> Okay.<br> Then let's get something straight.<br> I'm more than happy to go in<br> and analyze him.<br> In fact, I'm looking forward to it.<br> But I won't go in there<br> to validate his story, understood?<br> - You do your job, I do mine.<br> - That's right.<br> Listen, if I think it's necessary,<br> I'd want to get an MRI, EEG,<br> and neuropsych testing, agreed?<br> - Yes, Doctor. Good night, Doctor.<br> - Good night.<br> I'll be recording our meetings<br> for Mr. Vail,<br> so what we talk about<br> isn't as confidential the way it might be<br> if you were to be consulting<br> with a doctor for help.<br> He may even call me as a witness,<br> so if you have any questions<br> about what I've just said,<br> you should raise them now,<br> while he's still here.<br> - No, ma'am. I understand.<br> - Good.<br> - So, okay. I think we'll be fine.<br> - All right.<br> - I'll see you later. All right.<br> - Okay.<br> Bye.<br> Mr. Vail told me<br> that there was a period of time<br> surrounding the Archbishop's death<br> that you don't remember.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yeah. Yes. I lost the time.<br> I mean, I blacked out.<br> - Have you had these blackouts before?<br> - Yes. Yes, I have.<br> When's the first time<br> you remember them happening?<br> They started<br> when I was about 12, maybe.<br> Were your parents aware<br> of what was happening to you?<br> No. My mother was dead.<br> And your father?<br> No. No. No. He was not a nice man.<br> - Did you seek treatment?<br> - Did I what?<br> Did you see a doctor for them?<br> No. No.<br> You don't go see a doctor in Creekside<br> unless your leg's broke.<br> - Hey. Can I talk to you?<br> - Talk.<br> - Excuse us. I'll bring her right back.<br> - How dare you. What am I?<br> I'm some kind of chess piece<br> you can just move around?<br> - I was in the middle of my lunch.<br> - When are we getting all the discovery?<br> What do you want, Marty?<br> I want to know<br> when we're getting all the discovery.<br> - I've got motions to file.<br> - No, you don't.<br> You're looking to make a deal.<br> I have no authority to deal.<br> I haven't discussed this with my client.<br> What's your excuse?<br> Well, if I thought we needed<br> to make a deal,<br> I have all the authority I want.<br> Bullshit! Shaughnessy wants<br> the whole shot on this,<br> and he's using you to get it.<br> Anybody in your position<br> would deal this down<br> to murder with no death penalty.<br> My position?<br> We have a fucking great case.<br> Great case?<br> Lack of prior record, no eyewitness,<br> no confession, no motive.<br> Hard evidence.<br> I assume this conversation means<br> you're not going with insanity,<br> which is a shame.<br> My shrinks would have torn him apart.<br> By the way, your pleading the Fifth<br> on the charges was brilliant.<br> - It was good, wasn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> I liked it.<br> You lose this case, you take the fall,<br> not Shaughnessy.<br> - Talk to me.<br> - We're going to trial, Marty.<br> All right, all it takes is one,<br> just one juror<br> that doesn't believe he did it.<br> One juror, with a kid his age,<br> looks into that face...<br> I've got to admit, that face is great.<br> Are you prepping him to take the stand?<br> That stutter, it's priceless.<br> Marty, don't tell me<br> you think he didn't do it.<br> What, has little Aaron Stampler<br> gotten to you?<br> We're not just talking about jail here.<br> It's about ending someone's life.<br> If you're wrong<br> and Shaughnessy's made you do this,<br> - you gonna be able to live with it?<br> - I'll live.<br> See you in court.<br> Your Honor, we stipulate<br> that murder was done here.<br> Therefore, these photographs<br> have no remaining probative value.<br> This is not just murder.<br> This is a case of mutilation and torture.<br> The only reason the prosecution wants<br> to show these gory pictures to the jury<br> - is shock appeal.<br> - That is not true, Your Honor.<br> - They should be excluded, absolutely.<br> - They clearly identify<br> the heinous nature of the crime,<br> and they connect the defendant,<br> who was found covered in blood,<br> to the crime scene.<br> - Prejudicial.<br> - I beg to differ.<br> - Beg all you want. I don't...<br> - Counsel, please.<br> The photographs are in, Mr. Vail.<br> Now, would you two like a recess<br> so you can carry on this discussion<br> in private?<br> I'm sorry, Your Honor,<br> but this is too much.<br> Next thing you know, he'll be objecting<br> if we want to bring in<br> the murder weapon.<br> Well, now that she brings it up...<br> This is a public building.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Vail.<br> Would you sign this for me?<br> Tell me about Linda.<br> Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.<br> Yes. Yes, she was.<br> How'd you meet?<br> Well, we was both at the Savior House.<br> I was an altar boy,<br> and she was doing work<br> for Bishop Rushman.<br> - What was the relationship like?<br> - Me and Linda?<br> She's real cultural.<br> Real cultural and very smart.<br> We had a nice time together.<br> We might get married.<br> Were you sleeping together?<br> - Well, that's private.<br> - I know. I have to ask the question.<br> Were you having<br> a sexual relationship, Aaron?<br> Yeah, yes, yes, we were.<br> Were you sleeping<br> with anyone else at the time?<br> - No.<br> - Was she?<br> Has she been to see you, Aaron?<br> - Well, well, no, but...<br> - And that upsets you.<br> No. No. Thing is, she went away.<br> She went away for a while.<br> She left before this happened.<br> I don't even think...<br> Don't even think she knows about it.<br> - Yo, boss.<br> - Hey.<br> - You got something for me?<br> - Yeah.<br> There's nothing cataloged<br> at the downtown branch<br> under the numbers B32156.<br> But I don't think the "B" is a "B."<br> I think it's an eight.<br> I think the knife slipped. 832156.<br> "Thomas Jefferson"?<br> I don't think he did it.<br> All right. Well, you're not gonna be<br> much happier with this.<br> A list of the Archbishop's charities<br> and his foundation's investments.<br> Nothing startling here,<br> except for how many there are.<br> Wait a minute here. What's this?<br> What was he doing<br> with the South River deal? Pull that up.<br> Who are the investors?<br> Shaughnessy?<br> That's Joey Pinero's neighborhood.<br> See this lot here?<br> This all used to be houses.<br> In fact, there was a house<br> over there on the corner<br> where I kissed my first girlfriend.<br> Got her pregnant, too.<br> - Hell of a kiss, Joey.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Anyway, this whole neighborhood's<br> gonna end up high-rent condos<br> if those guys get their way.<br> That's why I'm gonna buy back the lot<br> with the settlement you got me.<br> - You heard about that, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - The money?<br> - Who hasn't?<br> - Marty's the best, man.<br> - Just doing my job.<br> Yeah. A million fucking five,<br> he's just doing his job.<br> Alderman, Joey tells me<br> a cop came around,<br> wanted him to set you up.<br> It's typical.<br> Can't buy me,<br> so they try and buy a brother.<br> See, most people assume<br> that this land we're walking on<br> belongs to the railroad, but it doesn't.<br> It belongs to the church.<br> The church?<br> - So that's the Rushman Foundation?<br> - That's right.<br> Along with a bunch of rich developers.<br> - Including John Shaughnessy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Then they got greedy,<br> started buying up all the land<br> and old buildings<br> around the church property,<br> then tearing it down.<br> Our old neighborhood<br> was gonna disappear.<br> So I went to the Archbishop and I said,<br> "What are you doing to these people?<br> They're poor.<br> "They're getting kicked<br> out of their homes,<br> "and they're Catholic."<br> Fucking A.<br> He listened. I couldn't believe it.<br> He told them to stop developing<br> around the church property.<br> So the partners are left<br> holding these empty buildings<br> they can't knock down<br> - and land they can't build on.<br> - That's right.<br> Shaughnessy loses millions.<br> Look, if I need you to, will you testify?<br> Who, me? Yeah. Easy.<br> Just change out of this suit,<br> put on a Brooks Brothers<br> - with loafers and tassels, you bet.<br> - Joey, thank you.<br> Thank you. Not you.<br> Sure.<br> I'll testify.<br> Well, you know what people think.<br> Think this great city runs itself.<br> They think it gets up, goes to work and<br> climbs into bed at night just like we do.<br> They're unaware of what it takes<br> to make sure the whole damn thing<br> doesn't break down.<br> Crime, fires, riots,<br> the goddamn water pipes<br> bursting under the city.<br> Christ, what a fucking mess that was.<br> And who does<br> the water commissioner call?<br> The contractor who built it? No.<br> He calls me. They all call me.<br> God damn, this is terrific.<br> They call me,<br> because I keep the peace.<br> That's my job.<br> This city doesn't burn<br> because I won't permit it.<br> I'm the great negotiator.<br> You think people get that?<br> Truth is, they don't care.<br> Dumb bastards don't even vote.<br> All they want to do is eat,<br> sleep, watch TV<br> and occasionally fuck their wives.<br> Guess we should all thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> John, you need some new material.<br> I've heard this "great city" speech<br> 10 times already.<br> Your boy Pinero's not honoring<br> his side of the deal.<br> Is that what this dinner was about?<br> Pinero?<br> In part.<br> I told him what the deal is.<br> He's a grownup. What's the other part?<br> I understand your assistant's<br> been digging around<br> in the Archbishop's financial affairs.<br> Yeah. Well...<br> How much did you lose<br> when he pulled the plug<br> from South River, John?<br> Let me tell you something.<br> It's a mistake to stick your thumb<br> in the eyes of the most powerful people<br> in the city.<br> It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.<br> Do not fuck with me, Marty.<br> Pipes are bursting again, John.<br> In the most anticipated murder trial<br> in recent Chicago history,<br> former State's Attorney prosecutor<br> Martin Vail will lead<br> with his opening statement<br> on behalf of Aaron Stampler...<br> The prosecution's case is headed<br> by Assistant State's Attorney<br> Janet Venable. Venable was...<br> Richard Rushman was a man of God.<br> He spent his life giving<br> to the people of Chicago.<br> He was a beacon of inspiration,<br> not only as a spiritual leader,<br> but as a citizen.<br> ...will deliver his opening statement<br> tomorrow on behalf of defendant...<br> My name is Martin Vail,<br> and the reason I'm here,<br> and the reason you're here,<br> is to make sure<br> that the whole truth is known.<br> Now, we can begin to learn the truth<br> by talking about what the prosecution<br> does not want you to hear.<br> Do not be fooled by the defendant's<br> innocent appearance and demeanor.<br> Aaron Stampler sat in judgment<br> of Archbishop Rushman<br> and determined that<br> not only should he die,<br> but he should die<br> the most brutal way possible.<br> Aaron was arrested within minutes<br> of the Archbishop's death.<br> We all know that.<br> We all saw it on television.<br> But why? Because he was convenient.<br> Because there was enormous pressure<br> on the police to solve this crime.<br> The evidence will show<br> that Aaron Stampler stalked, ambushed<br> and savagely murdered this great man.<br> The prosecution does not want<br> you to hear<br> about the other altar boys<br> in the church choir<br> who have mysteriously disappeared.<br> At the close of evidence,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> you will learn that Aaron Stampler<br> had everything he needed<br> for the perfect assassination.<br> Using this knife,<br> Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed<br> at the Archbishop's chest,<br> his genitals, his eyes.<br> They don't want you to hear<br> that the Archbishop made investments<br> on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church<br> and that those investments<br> resulted in huge losses<br> for some very, very powerful people.<br> They don't want you to hear about<br> the 20 death threats this year alone<br> that the Archbishop received<br> prior to his death.<br> And they really don't want you to hear<br> about their theory of motive.<br> And why is that? Very simple.<br> They don't have one.<br> Inspector Woodside,<br> can you explain to the court<br> where these sneakers came from?<br> They were taken off the defendant<br> when he was apprehended.<br> And what was the result of<br> the bloodstain analysis done on them?<br> The result of the analysis<br> proved to be human blood<br> matching the blood type<br> and DNA characteristics<br> of Archbishop Rushman.<br> What do the bloody footprints<br> surrounding the body tell you?<br> The killer left a pattern<br> of bloody footprints<br> around the area of the struggle,<br> as indicated by the spread of blood<br> through the room.<br> All right, yes or no, Inspector?<br> Could there have been a third person in<br> the Archbishop's quarters that morning?<br> There is no evidence to suggest that.<br> But there's no evidence<br> to prove there wasn't.<br> No.<br> And after the struggle,<br> what happened then?<br> Well, analysis suggests that the killer<br> was startled during the mutilation<br> and ran from the bedroom<br> down the stairs.<br> Is it possible, Inspector,<br> that the real killer, a third person,<br> who maybe was smart enough<br> not to tramp a whole freeway of blood<br> through the whole place here,<br> couldn't this third person have placed<br> the defendant's prints<br> on the knife while he was passed out?<br> Mr. Vail, anything is possible.<br> So, clearly, the victim suffered<br> a great number of stab wounds?<br> Yes, he did, 78.<br> He tried to defend himself.<br> And that explains the cuts<br> on the hands and the forearms.<br> Doctor, isn't it a fact<br> that you can't be sure<br> whether more than one person inflicted<br> these 78 stab and incise wounds?<br> That's true, Counselor. It could've been<br> more than one person, but I doubt it.<br> From your analysis<br> of the knife wounds, Dr. Weil,<br> do you have an opinion whether the<br> killer was left-handed or right-handed?<br> Well, the incise wound to the throat<br> and most of the chest wounds<br> were made from an angle that strongly<br> suggests that a left-handed person<br> was using the knife.<br> To your knowledge,<br> is the defendant left-handed?<br> Yes, he is.<br> Well, then it's possible<br> that a right-handed person<br> could've deliberately used his left hand<br> to inflict some of these wounds.<br> Yes, I suppose that is possible.<br> Then it would be reasonable to assume<br> that there was, in fact,<br> a third person there at the crime scene?<br> Reasonable, no. But it is possible.<br> Then following opening statements,<br> it was a day of strong<br> and detailed testimony<br> from the prosecution's first witnesses,<br> Cook County Forensics Chief<br> Harvey Woodside<br> and Cook County Medical Examiner<br> Emile Weil.<br> It was also a day of<br> tough cross-examination<br> of Woodside and Weil<br> by Stampler defense attorney<br> Martin Vail.<br> By most accounts, though,<br> the prosecution...<br> Captain Stenner,<br> I would like to thank you<br> for all the time you've given us today,<br> but, finally,<br> I would like to turn your attention<br> to the symbol carved<br> into the Archbishop's chest.<br> Now would you please tell the jury<br> about that, Captain?<br> Yes. The letter<br> and the numbers B32.156<br> were carved into<br> the Archbishop's chest.<br> What you just described,<br> have you been able<br> to find an identical reference anywhere?<br> I believe so, yes.<br> The symbol B32.156<br> is actually catalog code for a book<br> discovered in a private reading room<br> located in the church basement.<br> That particular number, the B32 part,<br> refers to a book,<br> The Scarlet Letter<br> by Nathaniel Hawthorne.<br> When we opened the book to Page 156,<br> we discovered an underlined passage.<br> Would you please read<br> this underlined passage to the court?<br> "No man, for any considerable period,<br> "can wear one face to himself<br> and another to the multitude<br> "without finally getting bewildered<br> as to which may be the true."<br> Thank you.<br> What does that passage<br> mean to you, Captain?<br> Objection. He's a policeman,<br> not an English professor.<br> His interpretation would be speculative<br> and irrelevant.<br> I didn't hear her ask<br> for an expert opinion.<br> The witness can answer.<br> Well, to me, it's simple.<br> The killer thought<br> that his victim was two-faced,<br> dishonest in some way.<br> In your experience, Captain,<br> do killers ever intentionally<br> leave clues to their motive?<br> Not often, but it happens.<br> Thanks.<br> - Thanks, man.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Did you underline that book?<br> - Did I what?<br> - Did you underline that book?<br> - No. No, Mr. Vail.<br> - No?<br> No. Mr. Vail.<br> I never even opened The Scarlet Letter.<br> I don't like Hawthorne.<br> I tried to read that one about the house<br> with the seven somethings<br> in high school.<br> I couldn't even get past Page 10.<br> I mean, I weren't the only one using<br> Bishop Rushman's library.<br> You know what? Everybody borrowed<br> books from Bishop Rushman.<br> He encouraged it.<br> His altar boys and staff,<br> everyone was in there.<br> Guard?<br> Thanks.<br> You don't give up, do you?<br> So you didn't know anything about that?<br> - No.<br> - What about the impact of...<br> Look, I can't talk to you right now.<br> My office will call you, all right?<br> - Yeah. Thanks.<br> - Okay, bye. Yeah, I'll see you.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> What the fuck happened in there?<br> I guess that eight was a "B" after all.<br> You think this is funny?<br> We're losing this case.<br> What the hell happened, Tommy?<br> How could you have missed that?<br> Marty, there are 50 of them,<br> plus the entire<br> Chicago Police Department.<br> How was I to know he had a private<br> reading room in the church basement?<br> - It's your job to know.<br> - Fuck, Marty, you want my job?<br> No. I want you to do your fucking job!<br> Marty, come on.<br> I'm working<br> on a third-man defense here.<br> Do you know that?<br> Have you figured that out yet?<br> I don't have a third man.<br> You know why I don't have a third man?<br> 'Cause you can't fucking find him!<br> That's why.<br> Is it that hard to find one indigent kid?<br> Look, maybe we already got<br> the kid who did this.<br> We have to at least consider<br> the possibility that he did it.<br> All the hard evidence<br> is pointing towards him,<br> and you keep refusing to even look at it.<br> I'm not refusing to look at anything!<br> I don't think he did it!<br> Look, you two,<br> we're up there in a couple of days,<br> and we got dick!<br> So I wish the two of you'd do<br> your fucking goddamn jobs, all right?<br> Fuck!<br> It must have been hard for you<br> to come here to Chicago.<br> You didn't know anybody.<br> No. Nobody.<br> Didn't have any money?<br> No, nothing.<br> I want to talk more about your girlfriend,<br> Linda, now. Can we, Aaron?<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> Aaron.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Do you think we can do this later?<br> - No, I want to stay with this for a minute.<br> - I'm just feeling a little tired.<br> I know. Why does talking<br> about Linda Forbes upset you?<br> It doesn't.<br> I just don't want to talk<br> about it right now.<br> - Why not? Are you all right?<br> - No, my head hurts.<br> Okay, okay, I'm sorry.<br> Let me just fix this.<br> Hey, you know what I can do<br> with this thing?<br> No, how the fuck should I know?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Aaron?<br> What?<br> What were you saying?<br> Come on.<br> Stop him!<br> Who the fuck are you?<br> What do you want?<br> What do you want, God damn it?<br> I'll kill you!<br> I don't think so, Alex. Drop it.<br> Drop it.<br> - Remember me?<br> - My name is Martin Vail.<br> I don't give a fuck what your name is.<br> - You got no right doing this to me.<br> - I have every fucking right!<br> I'm Aaron Stampler's attorney,<br> you little shit!<br> Now, what do you know<br> about the Archbishop's murder?<br> Nothing.<br> Where the fuck do you think<br> you're going?<br> Bullshit! Don't fuck with us.<br> I swear I know nothing.<br> Well, then,<br> what were you doing over there?<br> What were you doing at Aaron's house?<br> What were you looking for?<br> - A tape.<br> - A tape? Videotape?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Of what?<br> Sex stuff.<br> Sex stuff?<br> What, I have to draw a picture for you?<br> Who?<br> Who?<br> Me, Linda.<br> And Aaron?<br> Yeah. He shot it, too,<br> for the Archbishop.<br> Are you telling...<br> Are you telling me that Archbishop<br> Rushman is involved with sex stuff?<br> Yeah, he called it "purging the devil."<br> He'd say a sermon for 10 minutes,<br> and then he'd tell us what to do.<br> - You're full of shit.<br> - I don't give a fuck what you believe!<br> Hey, hey, hey. What? What?<br> What were you going to do<br> with the tape?<br> - What were you going to do?<br> - Trash it.<br> I was gonna throw it away.<br> Just one. One tape. Just one tape.<br> Yeah. Yeah. One. He'd use the same<br> one. He'd keep recording over and over.<br> So what made you think Aaron had this?<br> I don't know. I thought maybe he got it,<br> and he went back and killed him.<br> - I mean, he did kill him, right?<br> - No, he didn't.<br> So where's this girl? Where's Linda?<br> I don't know.<br> She freaked out!<br> She panicked. She split.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm not expecting any postcards.<br> Look at me. Look at me.<br> Get him the fuck out of here, Tommy.<br> - Where to?<br> - A warm bunk and three meals a day.<br> - You can't arrest me! You're not a cop!<br> - I used to be. Does that work for you?<br> - Look who's here.<br> - Don't get up. Finish it.<br> - It's a good article.<br> - You know the rules.<br> Don't disturb anything.<br> Don't remove anything.<br> If you do, it's my ass.<br> Yeah, mine, too. I won't touch anything.<br> Excuse me.<br> ...preach the gospel to every...<br> Hello.<br> - What are you guys watching?<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Go to her. Good.<br> Now help her. That's it, Aaron. Good.<br> Linda, help out.<br> Good. Take off her blouse, Aaron.<br> That's it. Now help him, Linda.<br> Isn't that sweet, Linda? Good. That's it.<br> Now, take him in your mouth.<br> - Here's motive.<br> - Aaron,<br> take her from behind.<br> - Aaron, take her from behind.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> Thanks.<br> 487113 report to...<br> - I need to talk to him alone.<br> - I think there's something<br> - we should discuss.<br> - I need to be alone with my client.<br> Do you trust me?<br> Do...<br> Yes, yes, of course I do.<br> Good. Because I don't trust you.<br> I'll lay it all out for you.<br> I'm losing this case.<br> You know why I'm losing this case?<br> 'Cause my fucking client<br> is fucking lying to me.<br> - I never lied to you.<br> - Bullshit!<br> That's it. No more bullshit.<br> No more games.<br> Everybody thinks<br> you did this, everybody.<br> I'm the only one who believes you,<br> and I am that close.<br> So I want it all out. All of it.<br> Right now, right here.<br> Did you underline that book?<br> Hey, hey. Hey, look at me.<br> Did you underline that book?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - I don't believe you.<br> - That is bullshit.<br> - I told...<br> I don't fucking believe you!<br> I saw the tape!<br> I saw the tape. I know what he did<br> to you. I want to hear it from you.<br> No! No! No!<br> Tell me the whole thing.<br> Don't fucking do this.<br> I want you to tell me the truth,<br> and do not even think of lying.<br> You fucking killed him, didn't you?<br> You did it!<br> - You killed him. You're so full of shit!<br> - No!<br> You did it, didn't you?<br> Tell me the truth. Don't lie to me.<br> You little fuck! You did it.<br> You killed him! You son of a bitch!<br> - You fucking killed him!<br> - No!<br> What the hell do you want<br> from me now?<br> Quit your crying! I can't understand<br> a goddamn word you're saying.<br> You little sissy! You make me sick!<br> - Looky here. Who the fuck are you?<br> - Who the fuck are you?<br> This is my cell, Jack!<br> Who the fuck are you?<br> I got you now. You're the lawyer.<br> - You his lawyer, ain't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, with your fancy suit.<br> I heard about you.<br> Well, my, my, you sure<br> fucked this one up, Counselor.<br> It sounds to me like they're gonna<br> shoot old Aaron so full of poison<br> it's gonna come out his eyes!<br> - Where is Aaron?<br> - Aaron's crying off<br> in some corner somewhere.<br> You scared him off!<br> You've got to deal with me now, boy.<br> I ought to give you a beating<br> on principle. Look at me.<br> You ever come in here and pull any<br> of that tough-guy shit on Aaron again,<br> I will kick your fucking ass to Sunday!<br> - Do you understand me?<br> - I understand you. I understand.<br> Aaron gets in trouble, he calls you.<br> You're the man.<br> Well, Aaron couldn't kick his own ass.<br> I mean, you seen him, with the...<br> Yeah.<br> Jesus Christ, he can't handle anything.<br> He sure as shit couldn't handle<br> all that preacher's blood, could he?<br> If he'd done like I told him,<br> we wouldn't be in this mess,<br> but he got scared, and...<br> Ran off, got hisself caught,<br> the stupid little shit.<br> So Aaron did kill Rushman.<br> Hell, no!<br> Jesus Christ, where did they find you?<br> Ain't you been listening to me?<br> Aaron don't have the guts to do nothing.<br> It was me, boy.<br> - It was me.<br> - It was you.<br> - It was you. It was you.<br> - Yes, it was.<br> He come crying to me like always,<br> stuttering and whining.<br> "I can't take it no more, Roy.<br> You got to help me.<br> "Please, please, Roy."<br> I said, "Shut your mouth, you little girl!<br> "Grow up. Be a man.<br> Take care of yourself."<br> - Be a man, yeah.<br> - Know what I'm saying?<br> So your name is Roy?<br> Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Yeah.<br> What is it? Marty?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey, listen, Marty.<br> I'm dying for a smoke.<br> Do you have a cigarette on you?<br> - No, I quit.<br> - Fuck that.<br> I can't live without them. There's got<br> to be a butt around here somewhere.<br> Roy.<br> Roy, tell me about Linda.<br> - Linda?<br> - Linda, yeah.<br> Well, who the fuck cares about Linda?<br> Well, I care about Linda.<br> I'd like to know about Linda.<br> That little tramp.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> Everybody had a piece of her,<br> you know what I'm saying?<br> I mean, she had Aaron<br> wrapped up so tight,<br> he actually thought<br> she was his girlfriend.<br> It was pathetic. She broke his heart.<br> So that's why you had to kill Rushman,<br> because of the sex stuff.<br> You've seen the tape.<br> Answer me, you son of a bitch!<br> Do you think I'm playing with you?<br> I will break your fucking neck!<br> I'm going to ask you again.<br> Have you seen that tape?<br> I saw the tape.<br> Yeah, of course I saw the tape.<br> God damn it, God damn it.<br> I told him to get that tape.<br> I said, "Get the fucking tape.<br> It's motive, you asshole!"<br> This is going<br> to fuck everything up, Marty.<br> Don't you show that<br> to a goddamn person!<br> - Do you understand me?<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> - Do you understand me?<br> - Yes. Shit.<br> - Aaron.<br> - Damn!<br> Mr. Vail?<br> Yeah, I'm right here, Aaron.<br> He did it. The little fuck did it.<br> How could I have missed that?<br> - Do I need stitches?<br> - No.<br> He didn't do it. Aaron has no idea<br> what just happened in there.<br> I kept seeing all the signs, the big ones.<br> The abusive background,<br> these repeated blackouts,<br> the ellipses in thought.<br> He's ambidextrous.<br> That's what I was trying to tell you<br> when you came in tonight.<br> Look, you may be thrilled by all this,<br> but I'm fucked. I don't have a case.<br> It's textbook<br> multiple personality disorder.<br> Put me on the stand. I'll testify.<br> He's insane.<br> I can't. I can't change plea<br> in the middle of a trial.<br> The judge would never allow it.<br> Besides, insanity is<br> the hardest thing to prove.<br> Okay.<br> My professional opinion?<br> This is not a criminal<br> we're dealing with. It's a sick kid.<br> He's sitting in a cell,<br> and it's not where he belongs.<br> You got an aspirin?<br> Come on, Connerman, ask it.<br> Ask what?<br> The question<br> you wanted to ask me before.<br> I don't understand, Mr. Vail.<br> "How can you defend someone<br> if you know they did it?<br> "How can you do that?<br> "How can you fucking defend<br> these fucking scumbags?"<br> Isn that what you wanted to ask me?<br> It is, isn't it?<br> All those fucking coy questions,<br> all that bullshit.<br> Bottom line is,<br> "How can you do what you do?"<br> You think it's the money, don't you?<br> The money's nice.<br> The money's very, very nice, Jack.<br> You know,<br> the first thing I ask a new client is,<br> "You been saving up for a rainy day?<br> "Guess what? It's raining."<br> You think it's because I want to see<br> my face on the cover of magazines?<br> My 15 seconds on TV? I love it.<br> I fucking love that shit. I really do,<br> but guess what.<br> It's not it.<br> - You go to Las Vegas?<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't go to Vegas.<br> Why do you think I don't go to Vegas?<br> Marty, it's late. I think that<br> we should both just get up and go...<br> Why gamble with money when you can<br> gamble with people's lives?<br> That was a joke.<br> All right, I'll tell you.<br> I believe in the notion that people<br> are innocent until proven guilty.<br> I believe in that notion<br> because I choose to believe<br> in the basic goodness of people.<br> I choose to believe that not all crimes<br> are committed by bad people,<br> and I try to understand<br> that some very, very good people<br> do some very bad things.<br> You know,<br> when I was working for Shaughnessy,<br> I did something very, very bad. Maybe<br> illegal. I was a prosecutor then.<br> This thing that I did, I was very upset<br> by it, and I decided to leave.<br> So I left. I became a defending attorney.<br> The irony being that everyone<br> assumes I'm fucking lying anyhow.<br> So I made myself this little promise that<br> I would reserve my lies<br> for other than my public life.<br> You print any of this,<br> I'll sue your fucking ass.<br> All right, all right,<br> so I made a little mistake.<br> No shit.<br> What do you want? Want a new suit?<br> I'll buy you a new suit.<br> You made a mistake?<br> You told us the third man did it.<br> So now you got your third man<br> and a fourth man and a fifth man...<br> What are you going to do, Marty?<br> I don't know. I really fucked up here.<br> You were right.<br> So how are you gonna get him off?<br> I don't know.<br> What I know is, Aaron did not commit<br> first-degree murder.<br> - Marty, he stabbed him a billion times...<br> - No, not Aaron.<br> To convict someone of a capital crime,<br> the State must prove intent.<br> Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.<br> Yeah, but the only way to prove that<br> is to change the plea to insanity,<br> which we can't do mid-trial, unless<br> you're planning on a career change.<br> I could've been mistaken,<br> but I wasn't wrong.<br> Aaron is innocent. It's Roy who is guilty.<br> This kid doesn't need a lawyer.<br> He needs an exorcist.<br> Tom, you are so full of shit. You were<br> not there, and you didn't see it.<br> He's one sick motherfucking boy, man,<br> who's been fucked around his whole life<br> by his father, by his priest.<br> This kid does not deserve to die,<br> and it's our job to make sure that a jury<br> believes he doesn't deserve to die.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay. How do we do it?<br> By somehow introducing<br> this whole abuse thing.<br> - The tape.<br> - What about the tape?<br> That's crazy. That gives him motive.<br> No, it looks like that, but it's...<br> No, actually, what it does is,<br> it turns this whole thing around.<br> It gives concrete documentation<br> of what Rushman did to this kid.<br> But we can't put it in. You know that.<br> But we're not going to.<br> Oh, fuck!<br> - Okay. Okay.<br> - Good.<br> - Yeah.<br> - What the hell are you doing?<br> - Who is this?<br> - You know damn well who it is.<br> - Barleycorn's, Marty. Now.<br> - Janet?<br> Cute porno. Part of your collection?<br> Hey.<br> Where did you get it? You steal it<br> - from the crime scene?<br> - I don't know anything about this tape.<br> - You are such a liar.<br> - Think about it.<br> - I have.<br> - Look, if this tape really has on it<br> what you say it does,<br> last thing I'd do is give it to you.<br> It gives you motive.<br> - You had to give it to me.<br> - Why?<br> You couldn't introduce it in court.<br> The jury would despise you for it,<br> for dishonoring the Bishop's memory.<br> But if you get me to show it, motive or<br> no motive, I'm the one who looks bad,<br> and you gain sympathy<br> for your poor little abused boy.<br> - You think so?<br> - I hate you.<br> Don't use it.<br> I have no intention of using it.<br> - The usual, Stu.<br> - You got it.<br> You're up to even more than that,<br> aren't you?<br> I'm not up to anything.<br> You're opening a door, you think<br> I'm going to walk through it?<br> There's going to be a tiger<br> on the other end, and I don't...<br> You know who'd be really upset<br> if you used it?<br> - I just told you...<br> - Shaughnessy.<br> - Fuck him.<br> - Fuck him?<br> Fuck you.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> All right, if this is not your motive,<br> what is?<br> I have motive.<br> Yeah, what is it?<br> I'm really gonna tell you.<br> Well, you better tell the jury pretty soon.<br> Time's running out.<br> Here you go.<br> You think you've got me.<br> You think because you know me as<br> well as you do, you know how I think.<br> Well, I know how you think.<br> You know what I'm thinking?<br> What happened to your face?<br> I bumped it into a medicine cabinet.<br> No, Marty,<br> that was a girl on her way out.<br> Maybe we should come back here later.<br> Later? Well, they close in 10 minutes.<br> No, after.<br> After the trial.<br> When we've got nothing to lose.<br> How can your timing<br> be so good in a courtroom<br> and so bad in real life?<br> I'll think about it later.<br> I hate you too much right now.<br> You got a visitor.<br> Here she comes.<br> - Talk to you later.<br> - Okay.<br> Janet.<br> Morning.<br> So where's the tape?<br> There's some pretty ugly stuff<br> on that tape.<br> - Yes, there is.<br> - Who would've thought?<br> - Where did it come from?<br> - Landed on my front door last night.<br> - No note.<br> - Vail?<br> - Who else?<br> - Clever prick.<br> What do you think he's up to?<br> - I honestly don't know.<br> - Cut the crap, Janet.<br> You know him pretty goddamn well.<br> You were balling him, for Christ's sake.<br> - Where is it?<br> - At home.<br> I have some advice for you.<br> My advice for you, if you really have<br> aspirations beyond this particular office,<br> is to pick up that little handbag of yours,<br> go home right now and destroy this tape<br> you should've destroyed, like I did,<br> the minute you received it.<br> You don't think Vail has a copy?<br> You don't think there's an original?<br> It's Stampler that's on trial,<br> not the Catholic Church,<br> and if you haven't found another motive<br> to hang him on, then God help you.<br> All rise.<br> Please, sit down.<br> Madam Prosecutor.<br> Miss Venable.<br> The State calls Thomas Goodman.<br> Objection, Your Honor.<br> Prosecution knows full well<br> that Mr. Goodman is my investigator<br> in this case,<br> and under the Work Product Rule,<br> he can't be compelled to testify.<br> Permission to approach the bench,<br> Your Honor?<br> Granted.<br> Important evidence has just<br> come into my possession<br> which I believe<br> this witness can authenticate.<br> That's Mr. Vail's privilege. If Mr. Vail<br> doesn't want Mr. Goodman to testify,<br> Mr. Goodman doesn't testify.<br> Make a decision, Mr. Vail.<br> Mr. Goodman, have you ever been<br> to my apartment?<br> - No.<br> - By that I mean my apartment building.<br> Allegedly.<br> I'm sorry, you're confused.<br> Either you have or you haven't.<br> "Allegedly" doesn't figure into it.<br> I have been there, yes.<br> - Why did you go there?<br> - I was delivering something.<br> For whom?<br> Martin Vail.<br> Mr. Vail sent you<br> to deliver something to me.<br> - Yes.<br> - What was it?<br> A videotape.<br> Could this have been the tape<br> you delivered for Mr. Vail?<br> I have a feeling it is, yes.<br> The People place<br> this half-inch videocassette tape<br> - in evidence, Your Honor.<br> - So ordered. Bailiff, please index.<br> Now, where did Mr. Vail get this tape,<br> if it is indeed the same one?<br> He took it from the closet<br> of Archbishop Rushman.<br> - He stole it.<br> - No, no, he borrowed it.<br> Once I made the transfer for him,<br> I returned it, so...<br> Can you describe for me<br> what's on this tape?<br> There was a sermon<br> by Archbishop Rushman on it,<br> a rehearsal of a sermon, I should say,<br> followed by<br> - a kind of home movie.<br> - A home movie? Of what?<br> - Some altar boys.<br> - And?<br> - A girl.<br> - Doing what?<br> An altar-boy lesson of some kind?<br> Having sex.<br> Quiet.<br> A porno movie.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes. Now.<br> How is it, do you think,<br> that this tape, this porno tape,<br> was in the Archbishop's closet<br> in order for Mr. Vail to find it there?<br> - He was the... The director.<br> - Who was?<br> - Archbishop Rushman.<br> - Quiet in the court!<br> And was the defendant<br> one of the altar boys<br> performing in the Archbishop's<br> home movie?<br> - Yes, he was.<br> - Was his girlfriend?<br> I believe her name is Linda Forbes.<br> Yes, she was.<br> And did it appear to you<br> that the defendant was enjoying<br> performing in this film<br> with his girlfriend?<br> No, he does not.<br> I will not ask you, Mr. Goodman,<br> if you think we have just<br> uncovered motive here.<br> We will decide that for ourselves<br> once we've all seen the videotape.<br> No further questions.<br> Does Defense wish to cross?<br> - No, Your Honor.<br> - Court's in recess.<br> Bailiff, please set up for the tape.<br> Mr. Goodman, you're excused.<br> Thanks for the advice.<br> - Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.<br> - Yes. Yes, she was.<br> - How'd you meet?<br> - We was both at the Savior House.<br> I was an altar boy,<br> and she was working<br> for Bishop Rushman.<br> Doing what?<br> Were you sleeping<br> with anyone else at the time?<br> - No.<br> - Was she?<br> No.<br> Has she been to see you, Aaron?<br> - Yeah? No, I'm still here.<br> - No.<br> - What?<br> - Does that upset you?<br> Okay.<br> Mr. Vail, are you prepared to proceed<br> with your first witness?<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> The Defense calls John Shaughnessy.<br> The People object, Your Honor.<br> Mr. Shaughnessy has never been<br> identified as a possible witness.<br> - Your Honor, may I approach?<br> - Yes, you may.<br> Thank you.<br> My client is on trial for his life, here.<br> He's always maintained that there was<br> - someone else in that bedroom.<br> - And you think Mr. Shaughnessy<br> can somehow confirm that?<br> Your Honor,<br> the Constitution of the United States<br> takes precedence here,<br> permitting the calling of any witness<br> to promulgate evidence of innocence.<br> That's clearly stated<br> in the Sixth Amendment.<br> It's also profound in Brady vs. Maryland.<br> Mr. Shaughnessy,<br> do you serve on the board<br> of an organization known<br> as the Rushman Foundation?<br> I have the privilege to be<br> an honorary board member.<br> Could you briefly explain the nature<br> and purpose of this foundation?<br> The Rushman Foundation was founded<br> by the late archbishop.<br> Its purpose is to invest in projects<br> for the greater good of the community.<br> The greater good<br> of the community, okay.<br> Now, would that be true<br> in the case of the now bankrupt<br> - South River Housing Development?<br> - Yes.<br> Could you tell the court why the<br> South River project was abandoned?<br> There was a difference of opinion<br> as to the costs.<br> Wasn't there also<br> a difference of opinion<br> between the investors<br> and the late archbishop himself?<br> - I don't recall.<br> - Well...<br> What kind of money<br> are we talking about here? I mean...<br> How much money, Mr. Shaughnessy,<br> was invested in this failed<br> South River enterprise?<br> - $60 million.<br> - Quiet.<br> $60 million!<br> Wow, that's a lot of money.<br> You and the Archbishop<br> have been friends for, what, 20 years?<br> I think it's safe to say the two of you<br> knew each other really well.<br> That's right.<br> Were you surprised at the content<br> of that tape<br> - that Miss Venable submitted?<br> - Yes, of course I was.<br> So you've never heard any allegations,<br> charges against the Archbishop<br> during that time?<br> Not that I recall, no.<br> No, especially since you were the<br> State's Attorney for the last 15 years,<br> it'd be fair to say that you've supervised<br> all the prosecutions<br> in Cook County during that time,<br> especially the prosecutions<br> of all the prominent figures.<br> I also have a staff of 1,000<br> of the best prosecutors...<br> Yeah, yeah, but as State's Attorney,<br> it was up to you, ultimately, to decide<br> who would be indicted<br> and who wouldn't.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yeah. Okay.<br> Let me just take you back now.<br> Let's go back to June, 1985.<br> Do you recall any allegations<br> of sexual misconduct<br> - against the Archbishop at that time?<br> - I don't recall that, no.<br> No? Do you recall a young man<br> by the name of Michael O'Donnell<br> who came to the felony review unit<br> at your office?<br> I have no idea what you're talking about,<br> - Counselor.<br> - You don't?<br> This is so confusing to me,<br> because I have this document here<br> from the Chicago Metropolitan<br> Police Department,<br> and it says that, yes, Michael O'Donnell<br> spoke to the supervisor of that unit<br> over a period of two weeks,<br> explaining to him, in graphic detail,<br> sexual abuse he suffered<br> at the hands of Archbishop Rushman.<br> Quiet.<br> Isn it also true, Mr. State's Attorney,<br> that you then decided that your friend,<br> Archbishop Rushman,<br> was not going to stand trial for any of it?<br> He owed you big time, John.<br> You must have been really pissed off<br> when he pulled out of South River.<br> What happened? What was it?<br> He just finally said,<br> "I can't take it anymore"? He said, "No!"<br> - Mr. Vail.<br> - So you and your investors...<br> - Mr. Vail.<br> - ...had 60 million reasons to kill him!<br> - You little cocksucker!<br> - That's it. Witness dismissed.<br> This court's in recess.<br> Vail, in my chambers now.<br> That's for Joey Pinero,<br> you little shithead.<br> Start looking for a job.<br> If you think you can use my courtroom<br> to wage personal vendettas<br> and settle old scores,<br> you are sorely mistaken.<br> I'm striking Shaughnessy's testimony<br> from the record as irrelevant,<br> and I'm holding you in contempt<br> to the tune of $10,000.<br> So what you're telling me is, I can't get<br> a fair trial in your courtroom, is that it?<br> Be very, very careful, Mr. Vail.<br> You're on dangerous ground here.<br> Fine, fine. You want me to make<br> that check out to you, Judge?<br> Do you want me<br> to take you off this case?<br> You're making a mockery of my<br> courtroom, and I'm not going to allow it.<br> I suggest you start representing your<br> client and stop representing yourself.<br> ...do this later?<br> No, I want to stay with this for a minute.<br> - I'm feeling very, very tired.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> Why does talking<br> about Linda Forbes upset you?<br> It doesn't. I just...<br> - Okay, okay.<br> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> Hey, you know what I can do<br> with this thing?<br> How the fuck should I know?<br> Dr. Arrington, how much time<br> have you spent with Aaron Stampler?<br> Around 60 hours.<br> And what did you find<br> in the course of your evaluation?<br> I found that Mr. Stampler suffers from<br> an acute disassociative condition,<br> specifically,<br> multiple personality disorder.<br> Objection, Your Honor.<br> Now, Dr. Arrington is only stating what<br> she herself has personally observed.<br> - Your Honor.<br> - Counselors.<br> - Now, I know what you're doing.<br> - Will you excuse us for a minute?<br> Your Honor, if he wants to question<br> his client's sanity...<br> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish<br> a medical basis for amnesia here.<br> That is not what he's doing.<br> He's saying he's crazy.<br> - Are you?<br> - No, I am not.<br> I'll allow you to proceed with<br> this witness if you're very, very careful.<br> Absolutely. Yes.<br> Write down that he said that.<br> All right, where were we?<br> Now, could Aaron Stampler<br> have been present during the murder<br> of Archbishop Rushman<br> - and not remember it?<br> - Yes, he could.<br> Okay. Could you explain that, please?<br> Mr. Stampler's state at the time<br> of the offense was such that<br> his body could be present at a homicide<br> and yet his mind<br> would be unable to recall it.<br> - And how is that possible?<br> - The neurological mechanism<br> that would make this possible<br> began with the early abuse<br> suffered at the hands of his father.<br> In defense, Aaron's psyche splintered<br> and helped him to create<br> two separate personalities.<br> - Your Honor.<br> - I didn't say it.<br> - I did not say it...<br> - You've been warned twice now.<br> Do you really wanna pursue<br> this line of questioning?<br> And I suggest you think long and hard<br> before answering.<br> Your Honor, just one last question.<br> All right, Dr. Arrington,<br> in your opinion,<br> is Aaron Stampler capable of murder?<br> No, he is not. He is far too traumatized<br> to express normal anger and frustration.<br> He keeps his emotions repressed,<br> which is why he created Roy,<br> who is capable of such a crime.<br> - Objection, Your Honor.<br> - That's enough, Mr. Vail.<br> The jury will disregard this witness'<br> last statement, as will the court.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Madam Prosecutor,<br> - do you wish to cross?<br> - You bet I do.<br> Since you brought it up,<br> against the instructions of the court,<br> I'm curious to know,<br> is multiple personality disorder<br> your primary area of expertise?<br> It's not my primary field, no.<br> Is forensic psychiatry<br> your primary area of expertise?<br> - No, I'm a neuropsychologist.<br> - I see.<br> So you have no forensic experience,<br> and you're more of, let's say,<br> an academic?<br> Then you will forgive<br> this rather academic question.<br> I'm driving in my car,<br> somebody cuts me off.<br> I think to myself,<br> "I could just kill that guy,"<br> but I don't, now do I?<br> - I would hope not.<br> - That's right.<br> Things happen to us. People wrong us,<br> but we don't all go around<br> inventing psychopaths<br> to do our dirty work for us,<br> now, do we, Doctor?<br> I'm not suggesting you suffer from<br> multiple personality, Miss Venable.<br> - I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.<br> - Yes, I know. We heard.<br> You have also testified<br> that you have met this...<br> What was his name again?<br> - Roy.<br> - Roy what?<br> - He didn't give a last name.<br> - I see.<br> Did this Roy tell you<br> that he had murdered the Archbishop?<br> Mr. Vail was alone with him at the time.<br> I was watching through the window,<br> but soon after that I was in the room<br> and saw both Roy<br> and his transformation back to Aaron.<br> Did you happen to tape<br> this appearance of Aaron...<br> I'm sorry. I am sorry.<br> I just cannot get used to this name.<br> - Roy.<br> - Did you?<br> - No, the tape was off.<br> - Off?<br> So you have no record whatsoever<br> of his appearance.<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> Does Aaron Stampler know<br> the difference between right and wrong?<br> Yes, he does.<br> If Aaron Stampler butchered<br> the Archbishop, would he know...<br> Objection, Your Honor.<br> If Aaron Stampler<br> murdered the Archbishop,<br> - would he know he'd broken the law?<br> - Yes, he would, but it wasn't Aaron...<br> Yes, I know, Doctor. It was Roy.<br> That's all.<br> No further questions, Your Honor.<br> Witness may step down.<br> Miss Venable, if you would like to<br> re-open the Prosecution's case<br> and call the State's psychiatrist,<br> - I will certainly agree to it.<br> - No, I...<br> I don't think that's necessary,<br> Your Honor.<br> I think we all get the picture here.<br> Mr. Vail, are you ready to proceed?<br> Would you like a recess?<br> Roy?<br> Aaron.<br> Could you tell us a little about<br> your relationship<br> with Archbishop Rushman?<br> Well, he was like a father to me.<br> I loved him very much.<br> Why did you love him?<br> Why?<br> Well, he saved my life.<br> He was the only person who ever<br> treated me like I was worth anything.<br> Stop your whining, you little girl.<br> Be a man.<br> Now, we've all seen that tape<br> that you were in, Aaron.<br> How did that make you feel?<br> Did it change your feelings<br> about Archbishop Rushman?<br> No.<br> He was a wonderful man.<br> So you didn't feel anger towards him<br> about being forced to perform<br> in that tape?<br> No, he did everything for me.<br> There wasn't nothing else<br> I could do for him, and he needed it.<br> Do you know someone named Roy?<br> No, I don't.<br> You heard Dr. Arrington's<br> testimony about<br> what she and I saw there at the jail.<br> Aaron, some pretty strange things<br> going on there. Do you remember?<br> I heard what she said,<br> but I don't remember any of that.<br> - No recollection?<br> - No, sir.<br> Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?<br> No, sir, I did not.<br> Thank you.<br> Your witness.<br> Mr. Stampler,<br> would you like some water?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> - You sure?<br> Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.<br> Mr. Stampler, did you believe<br> that the Archbishop wore masks?<br> I'm sorry, what did you say?<br> Do you think he acted one way<br> in public and another way in private?<br> No, I didn't think that.<br> Isn that why you underlined<br> the Hawthorne passage?<br> Mr. Stampler?<br> No, I did not underline that book.<br> - You didn't underline it?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> And you didn't carve the numbers<br> referring to that passage into his chest?<br> No, no, ma'am, I did not. I told you I...<br> You loved him.<br> You loved him like a father.<br> Even though he made you<br> and your girlfriend<br> perform demeaning sexual acts<br> for his own gratification.<br> No, you don't understand. He...<br> There was no other way for him<br> to cast out his own demons.<br> - He needed it.<br> - He needed to get off, Aaron.<br> That's what he was doing.<br> That's what he needed you for,<br> to perform like a circus animal.<br> - That was your function in his life.<br> - No.<br> Mr. Stampler, I'm gonna ask you<br> straight, because I am tired,<br> and I've had just about<br> all I can take of this sordidness,<br> and I wanna go home,<br> and I wanna wash my hands,<br> and I wanna forget all about you<br> and Archbishop Rushman.<br> Did the Archbishop force you<br> and your girlfriend and others<br> to perform sexual acts<br> while he watched? Yes or no?<br> - Yes, he did, but...<br> - Yes. Yes, he forced you.<br> He forced you using a threat<br> of expulsion from Savior House<br> and a life on the street with no heat<br> and no water and no food.<br> He put you in front of a camera!<br> He made you take off your clothes!<br> And you don't think that<br> that's another side?<br> Another face of a man<br> that we all thought...<br> - No! No.<br> - Do you know what I would do<br> if someone did that to me?<br> I would kill him. I wouldn't hesitate.<br> - No.<br> - I would stab him<br> 78 times with a butcher knife!<br> I would chop off his fingers!<br> I would slash his throat open!<br> I would carve numbers into his chest!<br> I would gouge out his eyes!<br> I swear to God.<br> But that's me.<br> No further questions, Your Honor.<br> Where the hell do you think<br> you're going?<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Hey, you look at me<br> - when I'm talking to you, bitch!<br> - Mr. Stampler.<br> - Fuck you, lady! Come here!<br> - That's it.<br> Order! Bailiff! Order!<br> Come here! You wanna play rough?<br> Let's play rough. Come on. Back off!<br> - Roy! Take it easy.<br> - Keep coming, asshole.<br> You'll see if I don't break<br> her fucking neck.<br> - Roy, come here. I gotta talk to you.<br> - Fuck you, Marty!<br> - I'm walking out of here. Now, slow...<br> - It's me.<br> No! No! Don't you...<br> No!<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.<br> Don't even think of lighting<br> that cigarette, Miss Venable.<br> - How's your neck?<br> - I'll live.<br> I could call a doctor.<br> Mr. Shaughnessy just called<br> to inform me there will be no mistrial,<br> - as if that was his right.<br> - I can't believe<br> that scumbag has the balls to call here.<br> No, thanks.<br> What matters to me is<br> what you have to say.<br> Obviously,<br> your case has been damaged.<br> In fairness to the Prosecution,<br> I would declare a mistrial,<br> regardless of what<br> Monsieurs Shaughnessy and Vail think,<br> if that's what you want.<br> The Prosecution doesn't wanna try<br> this case again, even if it could,<br> which it can't, at least not by me.<br> And I think I can guarantee you<br> there's no one<br> in the DA's office who will,<br> so it's up to you.<br> I'm going to dismiss the jury<br> in favor of a bench trial<br> and a blind plea of not guilty<br> by reason of insanity.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yeah.<br> The defendant will be<br> remanded to Elgin<br> for an evaluation period of 30 days.<br> Let them decide<br> the term of his commitment.<br> Do either of you have<br> a problem with that?<br> Your Honor, he'll be out in a month.<br> Take it up with the Legislature,<br> Miss Venable.<br> I'm going home.<br> - Your Honor.<br> - No, Mr. Vail,<br> I am not refunding your contempt fine,<br> and the next time you wanna get<br> a client off on insanity,<br> you plead that way,<br> or I'll have you disbarred.<br> - You okay?<br> - Am I okay? Do I seem okay?<br> I get attacked by this sick twist,<br> I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.<br> No, Marty. I'm not particularly okay,<br> but, hey, you won,<br> justice was done.<br> Who the hell cares, right?<br> Congratulations.<br> You knew, didn't you?<br> You knew if I went after him,<br> he'd wig out up there.<br> Well, I knew he'd come out<br> if he was threatened.<br> And who better to do that than me?<br> You used me.<br> Yeah, I did. I had no choice.<br> What did I use, by the way,<br> that was so terrible?<br> I knew you'd do your job.<br> I knew you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.<br> I knew you'd try to win the case.<br> Now, what's wrong with that?<br> I lost my fucking job!<br> And that's good.<br> You should've left him years ago.<br> Christ, Marty, why is it you always think<br> you know what's right for me?<br> Because I'm arrogant.<br> I'm very,<br> very arrogant.<br> - You wanna dance?<br> - No.<br> - Sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> All you have to do is turn around.<br> No.<br> No.<br> I have to see my client.<br> - I'd like a minute alone with him.<br> - Are you sure?<br> Yeah. I'm sure.<br> You okay?<br> My head hurts.<br> You don't remember<br> what just happened?<br> - No?<br> - I lost time again.<br> Well, I got some good news.<br> They've agreed to stop the trial.<br> They're gonna be sending you<br> to a hospital.<br> You can get the help you need.<br> Now, there's a very good chance<br> you can get out someday soon.<br> Yeah.<br> I can't believe it.<br> - I don't know what to say, Mr. Vail.<br> - That's all right, Aaron. That's okay.<br> I knew, the minute<br> you came into my cell,<br> I knew everything was gonna be okay.<br> You saved my life.<br> Yeah.<br> I got to go.<br> - When will I see you again?<br> - Well, that's up to the courts now.<br> I don't want you to worry, Aaron.<br> I'm gonna stay on top of this, okay?<br> Thank you.<br> All right. You give me a call<br> if you need to. Okay?<br> - I will.<br> - All right.<br> - Hey, Mr. Vail?<br> - Yeah.<br> Will you tell Miss Venable I'm sorry?<br> Tell her I hope her neck is okay.<br> Yeah.<br> - What did you just say?<br> - What?<br> You told me you don't remember.<br> You black out.<br> So how do you know about her neck?<br> Well, good for you, Marty.<br> I was gonna let it go.<br> You was looking so happy just now.<br> I was thinking...<br> But to tell you the truth,<br> I'm glad you figured it,<br> 'cause I have been dying to tell you.<br> I just didn't know who<br> you'd wanna hear it from, you know.<br> I mean, Aaron or Roy, or Roy or Aaron.<br> Well, I'll let you in on a little secret,<br> sort of a client-attorney privilege type<br> of a secret. You know what I mean?<br> It don't matter who you hear it from.<br> It's the same story.<br> I just<br> had to kill Linda, Mr. Vail.<br> That cunt just got what she deserved.<br> But cutting up<br> that son of a bitch Rushman,<br> that was just a fucking work of art.<br> You're good. You are really good.<br> Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't I?<br> So there never...<br> There never was a Roy?<br> Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's<br> what you think, I'm disappointed in you.<br> I don't mind telling you.<br> There never was an Aaron, Counselor.<br> Come on, Marty, I thought you had it<br> figured there at the end.<br> The way you put me<br> on the stand like that,<br> that was fucking brilliant, Marty.<br> And that whole thing,<br> that, "Act like a man,"<br> Jesus, I knew exactly<br> what you wanted from me.<br> It was like we were dancing, Marty!<br> - Guard.<br> - Come on. Don't be like that, Marty.<br> We did it, man. We fucking did it.<br> We're a great team, you and me.<br> You think I could've done this<br> without you?<br> You're just feeling a little anger here<br> because you started to care about<br> old Aaron. I can understand that,<br> but, you know, love hurts, Marty.<br> What can I say?<br> Hey, I'm just kidding, bud!<br> I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!<br> What else was I supposed to do?<br> Hey, you're gonna thank me<br> down the road,<br> 'cause this is gonna toughen you<br> right up, Martin Vail!<br>
