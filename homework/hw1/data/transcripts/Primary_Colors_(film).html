                        I've seen him do it a million<br> times, but I can't tell...<br> you how he does it, Henry.<br> The right-handed part.<br> I can tell you what does with his<br> left hand. He's a genius with it.<br> He might put that hand on your elbow<br> or your biceps, like he's doing now.<br> Basic movie. He's interested in<br> you. He's honored to meet you.<br> But if he gets any higher, if he gets<br> on your shoulder, like that...<br> it's not as intimate. He'll share a<br> laugh with you, a light secret.<br> And if he doesn't know you that well,<br> but wants to share something...<br> emotional he'll lock you<br> in a two-hander.<br> You'll see when he shakes hands<br> with you, Henry. Governor.<br> Governor Stanton, this is<br> Henry Burton.<br> I meet your grandfather when I was a boy.<br> I hitchhiked to Washington to hear<br> him speak. He was a great man.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> He's glad you're coming on<br> board, I can see.<br> I'm not coming on board. I'm<br> just meeting him.<br> No, no. Take it easy.<br> Why is he here? He's a southern<br> governor nobody knows.<br> You sound like a campaign<br> manager already.<br> -Howard, I'm not.<br> -I'm kidding.<br> If I said Stanton's here because he<br> cares about adult literacy...<br> -you'd say I was full of it.<br> -Yes.<br> Howard, Henry, this is Mariane Walsh,<br> the librarian who runs these classes.<br> Thank you, Governor Walsh.<br> Governor Stanton, I'm sorry.<br> I'm a little nervous.<br> I'm sorry.<br> If you'll walk with me, I'll take<br> you up to the library.<br> The walls are pretty bad, but<br> the library is much, um...<br> -Better.<br> -Yes, yes.<br> We're very proud of the library.<br> When did you start the<br> reading program?<br> Three years ago. We have<br> very little money.<br> It's the only reading program like<br> it in Harlem I know of.<br> -There may be others, but I don't,...<br> -Know of them.<br> You okay?<br> -Are you okay?<br> -I'm fine.<br> I'm Ruby. I'm a domestic. I've<br> been in this class 2 months.<br> -Jack Washington. I'm a handyman.<br> -Hello, Jack.<br> -Twana Carter, waitress...<br> -Good to meet you.<br> Anthony Ramirez, freelance<br> carpenter.<br> I wanted to say welcome<br> aboard.<br> What? I'm not on board.<br> I just...<br> -You're kidding, right?<br> -Yeah.<br> Tell the governor a bit about<br> yourself, Dewayne.<br> I'm a short order chef.<br> And until I come here, I<br> couldn't read a lick.<br> Dewayne's dyslexic.<br> They just kept passing me up.<br> Third grade, fourth grade.<br> I just sit the back, sticking<br> to my own self.<br> It was like no one noticed.<br> And I went all the way through and<br> graduated elementary school.<br> They sent me to Ben Franklin...<br> that's general studies.<br> They could have sent me<br> to the Bronx Zoo.<br> No one ever said:<br> "Dewayne, you can't read.<br> What will you do with...<br> your sorry ass?" Excuse-me.<br> Anyway, graduation come and<br> my mama come.<br> She took the day off from the laundry<br> where she worked. So, we're there...<br> Dr. Dalembretti calls out the<br> names on the diplomas...<br> and what each kid done.<br> Like "Sharonna Harris,<br> honors."<br> "Tyrone Kirby, Regents Diploma."<br> And then...<br> he come to my name.<br> And he say, so everyone<br> heard it...<br> he said, "Dewayna Smith...<br> "receive a certificate...<br> of attendance."<br> You could hear people<br> buzzing.<br> A couple of folks laughed.<br> And I had to go up there and get<br> it. I had to stand up there...<br> just dying...<br> trying not to look at anyone.<br> Trying not to look too stupid.<br> And, uh...<br> Mama's in front. She has her hat<br> on and her purse in her lap...<br> tears coming down from behind<br> her glasses...<br> like someone... like<br> someone died.<br> I want to thank you...<br> for sharing that with us,<br> Dewayne.<br> I want to thank you all for<br> having real courage.<br> My uncle Charlie was...<br> a war hero, in World War II.<br> He went to Iwo Jima, where<br> they raised the flag.<br> He took out four machine gun<br> nests of japaneses soldiers...<br> who had pinned down<br> his buddies.<br> Did it with one grenade, his rifle,<br> bayonet, and bare hands.<br> Shit.<br> President Truman gave him<br> the Medal of Honor.<br> And when he came home,<br> there was a parade.<br> The town fathers came to my<br> parents' house and said:<br> "Charlie, what are you going to do<br> now" Charlie said he didn't know.<br> The mayor said,<br> "Maybe you'd like a college scholarship<br> in State University"<br> The banker said maybe Charlie<br> didn't want to go back to school.<br> Maybe he'd like a management<br> job with the bank.<br> And the sawmill owner said,<br> "Don't be cooped up...<br> in a school or bank. Come<br> manage my crew."<br> And you know what? Charlie<br> turned them all down.<br> -What did he do?<br> -Nothing.<br> He just laid on the couch and smoked<br> Luckies. Couldn't get him off it.<br> Was he messed up in the head<br> from the war?<br> No.<br> It was just that he<br> couldn't read.<br> He couldn't read and was too<br> embarrassed to tell anyone.<br> He had the courage to win<br> the Medal of Honor...<br> but didn't have the courage to do<br> what you're doing here.<br> He didn't have the courage to get<br> the help he needed.<br> So, know that I appreciate what<br> you're doing. And I honor it.<br> When people say, "Jack Stanton,<br> why spend so much...<br> effort on adult literacy?"<br> I say to them...<br> I say, " Because"...<br> it gives me a chance to<br> see courage."<br> I want to thank you.<br> I want to thank you for allowing<br> me to visit here today.<br> Let's get him out of here.<br> He likes it.<br> Governor Stanton, thank you<br> for coming today.<br> I will be damned.<br> I'm... Ooh! I'm sorry.<br> You're going to work for him.<br> Won't you?<br> No, I'm not. I'm just going to<br> meet him and talk.<br> -About what?<br> -Well, about going to work for him.<br> How can you quit on Adam Larkin<br> and get in bed with some...<br> cracker who's done piss for<br> blacks in his state?<br> I could say the same about Larkin.<br> But he will. He has to wait.<br> He's a black Congressman.<br> I don't like Larkin. I don't know<br> what Stanton wants, but...<br> I do. He wants to use the grandson<br> of a civil rights leader...<br> a black man i politics,<br> to get votes.<br> That's hilarious. Yeah, put a black<br> man on the team,...<br> that'll roll in these votes.<br> That's why so many black men<br> run the country.<br> If politics upsets you, work for<br> the Black Advocate.<br> We're never disillusioned.<br> Hand me that tie.<br> Get your own damn tie.<br> No, no tie, no suit. Just<br> leather jacket cool.<br> I'll be back in 2 hours, then we can<br> discuss the Black Advocate.<br> Don't be mad.<br> Okay, be mad, but only for 2<br> hours. Wait up for me.<br> Oh, my God. My boy.<br> Henry Burton. I am<br> mighty honored.<br> I'm Arlen Sporken, the Governor's<br> media consultant.<br> Nonfat caffeine?<br> I am delighted you're on board.<br> Honey, get me a sandwich.<br> Only if you pinch my cheek<br> and call me sugar.<br> I'll get it. We're going to<br> win this thing.<br> Absolutely. But the big question<br> is Ozio. You think...<br> has the "cagones" to run.<br> It's cojones.<br> I don't know Ozio well enough<br> to judge his cojones.<br> They're big, but they're glass.<br> Governor, it's nice to...<br> You remember Miss Walsh.<br> -Sorry.<br> -You all right, darling?<br> Thank you for this, um, opportunity<br> to discuss the, um...<br> The program. A great program,<br> don't you think, Henry?<br> Yes. It's an excellent program.<br> Now, tell the board what<br> we discussed.<br> Yes, I will.<br> -I'll just see my way out.<br> Thank you.<br> She's on the board of the<br> teacher's union.<br> Ah, a teacher and a librarian.<br> It's the missus.<br> Hi, darling.<br> Honey, I'm sorry. We got<br> stuck here.<br> But great news... We made real<br> progress with the teachers.<br> Tonight? Are you sure? Oh,<br> I'm sorry, honey.<br> Charlie, did we have a meeting<br> with the guy from the...<br> Portsmouth Democratic Committee?<br> Goddamn it, Charlie.<br> Are you Uncle Charlie, the<br> Medal of honor winner?<br> Well, I'm Uncle Charlie. And<br> whatever else he says.<br> If you'll stop popping my eardrum,<br> I'll leave now.<br> Don't... Susan, don't go.<br> Susan, just stay...<br> -We better go. Where's the plane?<br> -Teterboro.<br> All the way out there?<br> Okay, let's go.<br> Arlen, see you in D.C. Daisy,<br> go with Howard, Henry...<br> Mitch, Charlie, let's go.<br> Go? But I came to talk to<br> you about...<br> We'll talk on the plane.<br> -But I teach classes in the morning.<br> -Call in sick.<br> -The kids won't mind.<br> -Can I make a phone call?<br> When we get there. Now,<br> let's talk...<br> Hi, honey.<br> This is Henry Burton.<br> My wife, Susan.<br> I met you 25 years ago at<br> your grandfather's.<br> You were running under the sprinkler<br> in wet underpants.<br> He was a great man.<br> Thank you.<br> Jack could also be a great<br> man if he weren't such a...<br> -thoughtless, undisciplined shit.<br> -Why is this a big deal?<br> Because first impressions count,<br> asshole.<br> This is New Hampshire. These<br> people don't know you.<br> Hey don't even know your state.<br> They know Orlando Ozio, the<br> Governor of a real state.<br> But they came to meet you<br> and you didn't show.<br> I talked to the head of their<br> Democratic party about fly...<br> fishing for an hour and 45 minutes.<br> Do you realize how...<br> indescribably boring<br> fly-fishing is?<br> Do you realize I've now<br> committed to doing this,...<br> this thing with him?<br> I'm going fly-fishing because<br> of you, you asshole!<br> It's not funny. You can't do this<br> to me Jack.<br> We've been at this a month and<br> you're already fucking up.<br> The only shot we have<br> is to be perfect.<br> Barely adequate won't swing it.<br> Jack, you can't blow off...<br> Primrose Lane...<br> Life's a holiday on<br> Primrose Lane.<br> When I'm walking down<br> Primrose Lane...<br> -with you...<br> -You're not funny.<br> I have to find a phone.<br> When we get to the<br> apartment.<br> Honey, it was so great today,<br> this reading program.<br> You should have seen the people.<br> And the teacher was inspirational.<br> Tell me how good the curriculum was.<br> We can replicate a good curriculum.<br> You can't sell a program without<br> a good teacher.<br> Henry, was the teacher that<br> inspirational?<br> Well, she was...<br> She was a pretty typical school<br> board bureaucrat, I thought.<br> We got it on a 6-month sublet.<br> Better than a hotel.<br> Cheaper, too. We can keep clothes<br> and store stuff. We have privacy.<br> I don't care about privacy.<br> I'm here to get know...<br> I can't do that in private.<br> It's like the end of the campaign,<br> not the beginning.<br> Goddamn it, Charlie. No cable?<br> You can't run for President of the<br> United fucking States without CNN!<br> -Do you have any bags?<br> -No, I didn't expect to come.<br> -You want something to eat?<br> -Yeah.<br> This is the worst damn place<br> I've ever seen!<br> Hey, Darling.<br> It's four A.M. This is not how to<br> introduce yourself to the neighbors.<br> I'll make you coffee, Henry.<br> Well, I'm out of here<br> tomorrow morning.<br> I know we got to go cheap, but not<br> this cheap. Not loser cheap.<br> -So, why did you quit Larkin?<br> -What?<br> Why did you stop working for Larkin?<br> Careful, it's hot.<br> I just, um...<br> I know... you can't talk about your<br> old boss to your new one.<br> I don't have a new boss yet.<br> Larkin's very different from Jack.<br> Very cool.<br> Never blinks. A professional.<br> Wouldn't swallow tea<br> without testing it.<br> That's the real thing experience<br> teaches you. Isn't it?<br> How not to get burned.<br> -Do people ever learn that?<br> -Not the best people.<br> Adam taught me a lot...<br> but it was all the same. He<br> never surprised me.<br> No one ever voted with us<br> because it was right.<br> They always asked for a lulu.<br> Lulu?<br> It's New York for artificial<br> sweetener.<br> Anyway, we'd win and<br> then be gutted...<br> in the Senate. We'd accept<br> heir version.<br> Then the White House would veto,<br> which was no surprise.<br> Then we'd celebrate our great moral<br> victory. We'd forced a veto.<br> So you dropped out.<br> So why are you here?<br> Tell me.<br> Tell me.<br> It's four in the morning.<br> Let's just tell the truth.<br> Okay. Well...<br> I wondered how it would be to<br> work with someone...<br> who actually cared about...<br> I mean...<br> it couldn't always have been<br> the way it is now.<br> It must have been different in<br> my grandfather's time.<br> You were there. You had Kennedy.<br> I didn't.<br> I've never heard a president say<br> "destiny" and "sacrifice"...<br> without thinking, "bullshit."<br> Okay, maybe it was bullshit with<br> Kennedy, too, but...<br> but people believed it.<br> And, I guess, that's<br> what I want.<br> I want to believe it.<br> I want to be part of something<br> that's history.<br> I bet this is the longest answer<br> to a five word...<br> question you've ever gotten.<br> No, it isn't.<br> The longest was the one<br> I got to...<br> "Do you do much fly-fishing?"<br> It's a good answer, Henry.<br> History is what we're about, too.<br> What else is there?<br> Hei, March. Some guy about an<br> automobile insurance scam.<br> -It's me. Don't hang up again.<br> -Fuck you.<br> I'm in a coffee shop in New<br> Hampshire. I may not...<br> find another phone. Listen.<br> I think this guy could be<br> the real thing.<br> He's so incredible you could<br> work for him.<br> I mean, this son of a bitch actually<br> likes these people.<br> He's worth the risk.<br> Help me get him out of here. We<br> have a fund-raiser in 20 minutes.<br> You bastard. I waited form<br> you all night.<br> I can explain about that.<br> I got you some stuff at<br> the drugstore.<br> I can't go to Mammoth Falls<br> without clothes.<br> Give me your keys. Daisy can pack<br> some things and bring them to you.<br> Why I can't pack the things?<br> Because you're going to<br> Mississippi.<br> We have to set up campaign<br> headquarters before we go. Keys.<br> I thought you told us to hurry.<br> Susan... Mrs. Stanton, I'm not<br> sure. I mean, I don't know.<br> I've never helped run a presidential<br> campaign before.<br> Well, neither have we.<br> That's how history is made, Henry...<br> by the first-timers.<br> Are you, uh...?<br> Is this...?<br> Where are the state<br> party people?<br> They're tied up with the<br> congressional races. We're it.<br> All right.<br> Get me the national mailing<br> lists of every donor...<br> since the beginning of time.<br> I also need a complete database of<br> voting records on every candidate...<br> so we can set up a rapid<br> response operation.<br> How do we do that, honey?<br> Don't you, uh...?<br> Don't any of you have any<br> special skills?<br> I speak Hebrew.<br> Great.<br> -Now, double click on<br> "Pro-Choice".<br> Now call up the Harris vote.<br> No, no.<br> Why can't I learn this?<br> This announcement is for the<br> candidate briefing on the 23rd.<br> -Put it on five hundred leaflets.<br> -And then what?<br> Hand them out.<br> Call only the Orthodox and<br> Conservative synagogues.<br> Speak only to the rabbis and<br> start off in Hebrew.<br> -How's that?<br> -Great. We need to file that with...<br> Excuse me.<br> Terry? Terry!<br> Just hold out the leaflets for<br> people. Don't stalk them.<br> -How y'all doing?<br> We're... coming along.<br> -We don't have much staff yet.<br> -No, but what we have is choice.<br> Meet the most brilliant political<br> strategist in the party.<br> This is Richard Jemmons. This is<br> my right arm, Henry Burton.<br> -I sure admired your granddaddy.<br> -Great.<br> I'll pick you up at 7:00 for dinner.<br> We can talk politic.<br> Nice meeting you. Say hi to<br> Winona for me.<br> Who?<br> He means Jennifer. Every girl Richard<br> falls for is Winona Ryder to him.<br> Oh, that's, uh...<br> psychotic.<br> Does that smell good or what?<br> I'm glad you made it.<br> -It smells so good.<br> -We got it all set up for you.<br> -He's down there.<br> -He's got chicken.<br> Hey, Will, how's business?<br> Hey, Amalee, the Gov's here.<br> You got your mojo working<br> tonight?<br> Ain't no end to it, Gov.<br> Hei, Lo!<br> Gov's here.<br> How are you, honey?<br> I had to tell Jackie you were too<br> busy working to baby-sit...<br> and he was not happy.<br> How are you doing, Will?<br> Not so good since my mama died.<br> I miss her like a pain.<br> You got to let that happen. Your<br> mama deserves it.<br> Your pain will heal, but give<br> your mama her due.<br> We got to miss our mamas.<br> Nobody loves us like them.<br> Your mama still with you,<br> Henry?<br> No. She's in Beverly Hills with<br> her second husband.<br> You're a lucky man.<br> Thank you.<br> And the next time I see my<br> mama, she's blind.<br> A year later, she's got just one<br> leg from diabetes.<br> She could have done anything,<br> my mama. Been anything.<br> God bless the mamas.<br> My mama worked her<br> whole life.<br> My mama raised seven children.<br> If Ozio doesn't run, we focus<br> on New Hampshire.<br> He does we focus<br> on the South.<br> He may wait until<br> New Hampshire.<br> Shouldn't we wait for the<br> Governor for this?<br> He's in a mama-thon. That'll go<br> on all night in the south.<br> My mama worked her whole<br> life for her family...<br> and never did anything<br> for herself!<br> And now they're cutting her up!<br> Cutting pieces out of her!<br> Why is that happening to her?<br> I looked over Jordan<br> and what did I see<br> Coming for to carry me home<br> You know what Richard's<br> favorite song is?<br> It is the most American goddamn<br> song I can think of.<br> A Southern governor wrote it.<br> Know what I'm thinking of?<br> You are my sunshine<br> My only sunshine<br> You make me happy when<br> skies are gray<br> I didn't know a Southern<br> governor wrote that.<br> You'll never know, dear<br> How much I love you<br> Please don't take my<br> sunshine away<br> The over night, dear<br> As I lay sleeping<br> I dreamt I held you<br> in my arms<br> When I awoke, dear<br> I was mistaken<br> And I hung my head<br> and cried<br> You are my sunshine<br> My only sunshine<br> You make me happy when<br> skies are gray<br> You'll never know, dear<br> How much I love you...<br> I have a list of all grassroots<br> organizations in New Hampshire.<br> Great. Put it on my desk.<br> These rabbis are putty<br> in my hands.<br> Fantastic.<br> I started out with 200, I have one<br> left. Know how I did it?<br> I'm speechless.<br> I think my grandfather would endorse<br> the Governor, Jesse. Even if you ran.<br> Okay. You, to go, my friend,<br> Okay.<br> -Where the fuck are my clothes?<br> -Relax.<br> Daisy got sidetracked to<br> Washington.<br> Does this guy have a<br> chance in hell?<br> I haven't canvassed hell lately.<br> But if we worked for guys who had a<br> chance, we wouldn't have Richard.<br> Shit. He's bird-dogging.<br> Why don't you go over to my<br> hotel room with me?<br> -You're crushing my originals.<br> -Sorry.<br> You don't know you're missing.<br> Wait. Don't embarrass him.<br> I got cable. Want to walk<br> the snake?<br> What, you don't believe me?<br> Baby, I got a python in here.<br> Gee, I've never seen one<br> that old before.<br> Come on, bud. Park the Mustang<br> back in the garage.<br> Fuck you!<br> Fuck you, you redneck<br> son of a bitch!<br> Ever hear of Anita Hill? You're lucky she's cool.<br> I wouldn't have done it<br> if she wasn't.<br> And you know when a muffin is cool.<br> When to show her your cock.<br> Where'd you go to school?<br> Hotchkiss. You're a tight-ass<br> preppie elitist from hotchkiss.<br> -Bullshit!<br> -Bullshit it's bullshit!<br> You called me a redneck, which I'm<br> proud to say I am. You are a honky.<br> You just look black, and it's<br> your best part.<br> Lets you intimidate the palefaces...<br> and work that voodoo sexual<br> shit on white girls.<br> I'm blacker than you are. I got<br> slave in me, I can feel it.<br> You are crazy. What?<br> -You got a visitor.<br> -It's not a visitor. It's me.<br> -Where the fuck is my suitcase?<br> -I got it.<br> You can't let a lady carry<br> a suitcase.<br> Henry, I'm glad you got a wardrobe,<br> because we're having dinner...<br> with a very important person.<br> -Who?<br> -Governor Ozio's son.<br> What the fuck does<br> Ozio's son want?<br> It could be that Ozio's looking for<br> someone to endorse.<br> Jesus!<br> -That'd be something.<br> -You think?<br> -This must be handled just right.<br> -Just right.<br> Mind eating pig with<br> your hands?<br> -Is there any other way.<br> -Not in the South.<br> Jack, the governor's been<br> watching you.<br> He was hoping when you next pass our<br> way, you stop in. Get to know us.<br> Absolutely, Jimmy. You got the book.<br> When can we meet with...<br> Jimmy's dad, Governor Ozio?<br> Do you mind us talking business?<br> No, no. How else will I learn?<br> Next Tuesday we're in Albany, on<br> our way to New Hampshire.<br> -How's Tuesday?<br> -Let's look.<br> Tuesday. Let me just scroll<br> down here.<br> Tuesday's pretty full, but maybe I<br> can slot you in somewhere.<br> We land at four then do a drop-by at<br> the Teachers Union cocktail party...<br> before their dinner at<br> the Sheraton.<br> I'd skip that, but they'd notice. I'm<br> the only candidate invited to the party.<br> I know. The Governor turned it down<br> because he's speaking at the dinner.<br> Good. You'll both be at<br> the Sheraton.<br> You can meet after the cocktail<br> party and before the dinner.<br> Perfect.<br> -I'll see him there.<br> -Excellent.<br> Fuck all, Henry! You don't know<br> fuck about briefing me!<br> You make me look like<br> an amateur.<br> Like a barefoot, dipshit, third<br> rate, Southern fried...<br> piece of shit alderman!<br> You didn't know Ozio was<br> speaking at the dinner...<br> to keep me from shooting<br> my mouth off!<br> -Hello, Richard.<br> -If you'd like to make a call...<br> Shit! What kind of operation<br> do we got here?<br> How did we get scheduled for a drop<br> in when he's the main speaker?<br> Get me Howard!<br> -You threw the phone out the window.<br> -Stop the car.<br> Don't kill us, just stop it.<br> I think it lanted in the brush.<br> It landed in the trees.<br> I saw it.<br> I look like shit going to that<br> cocktail party. I'm Ozio's...<br> wamp-up, and he knows it.<br> But we didn't know it.<br> I told you, it lanted in the trees.<br> Jimmy probably told his dad he<br> has nothing to worry about.<br> He would have even if Henry hadn't<br> screwed up. Here's the phone.<br> It was in the brush.<br> Well, you wouldn't have found it if I<br> hadn't thrown it out of the car.<br> -Are you here?<br> -No.<br> Sorry, he's not here.<br> Henry Burton. Can I take<br> a message?<br> Oh, God. I see.<br> No, I got it, I got it.<br> -How reliable is Daisy?<br> -Hundred percent.<br> Then we just got bad news.<br> In an interview in Manhattan<br> Magazine, Ozio blasts you.<br> "His state's last in everything. He<br> knows shit about education."<br> You were right about<br> the meeting.<br> This is bad.<br> Hit back, Jack.<br> Not too hard or you lose<br> the liberals.<br> -You'll lose them anyway.<br> -Richard?<br> Give him a poke. We'll look better<br> when he drops out.<br> When who drops out? Ozio's 24<br> points ahead of us.<br> Exactly. If he's willing to<br> acknowledge us...<br> then he's the stupidest fucking<br> Italian since Nero...<br> or he's not going to race.<br> He'll sit and snipe.<br> -Doesn't matter. I won't do it.<br> Susan, I'm not going negative. Any<br> jackass can bum down a barn.<br> -It's self-defense.<br> -I'm not doing it!<br> Shane!<br> Come back, Shane.<br> Run for president.<br> How you doing, Henry?<br> Uh, fine.<br> There was a bender on<br> the interstate.<br> I'm on my way to meet the<br> family, so cancel Howard.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> And, um, governor, look...<br> about the Teachers<br> Union dinner...<br> I know how much I lay on you.<br> I know how hard you work for me,<br> and I'm honored by it.<br> I'm honored.<br> -But I should have thought...<br> -Forget it.<br> Now, get out of that office<br> and rest.<br> Open a bottle of Chablis. What are<br> you doing this weekend, Henry?<br> Setting up a list of meeting...<br> Do you think it's possible to<br> get yourself laid?<br> -Sir?<br> -I'm serious.<br> I don't want you too homy to<br> think straight when we need...<br> to start rolling. What are you<br> going thanksgiving?<br> You said you mama's in Beverly<br> Hills, so if you're free...<br> come spend it with Susan,<br> Jackie and me. It's not...<br> like being with your mama...<br> but we're family, too.<br> Thank you. Yes, I'd like that.<br> Good, good.<br> And, the reason I won't<br> take on Ozio...<br> is so I don't give that bastard the<br> power to make me the bastard.<br> All right? See you, Henry.<br> Right.<br> Dear Lord, thank you for what<br> we're about to receive.<br> Okay, son. Here we go.<br> Happy Thanksgiving,<br> everybody.<br> Who are all these people?<br> -Most are from shelters.<br> -You're kidding.<br> They come every year. That's<br> the good news.<br> The bad news is, he also<br> invites his friends.<br> People he's been collecting so he<br> can take them aboard when he sails.<br> Some of them really suck.<br> Henry? Daisy?<br> She has the same problem.<br> Meet Lucille Kaufman, an old<br> friend of mine from New York.<br> I marched with your<br> grandfather.<br> Lucille and I went to<br> law school.<br> You're Jack's coordinator? Do<br> something about his clothes.<br> And the campaign posters. And<br> Arlen Sporken too.<br> I'm swamped, or I'd join the<br> campaign full-time.<br> Henry, I want you to meet<br> my son, Jackie.<br> This is our family doctor,<br> Dr. Beauregard.<br> You and Jack must find a way to<br> educate them Yankees.<br> Maybe if they both wear capes.<br> This is Randy Culligan. I gave Randy<br> his first job as a law clerk.<br> Folks, may I have your<br> attention?<br> Folks, you'll know me. I'm<br> Jackie Stanton's mama.<br> How about if we sing<br> a chorus of...<br> "You Are My Sunshine"...<br> in honor of the great governors<br> of the South?<br> You are my sunshine<br> My only sunshine<br> You make me happy when<br> skies are gray<br> You're kidding. You're kidding.<br> Hey! Hey!<br> Wait, wait.<br> Ozio just dropped out.<br> That's fantastic! Yes!<br> Gentlemen, welcome to the<br> first debate of the...<br> Democratic Presidential Primary.<br> Remember to keep your responses<br> to one minute.<br> God, I'm so nervous,<br> I'm sick.<br> -Health care.<br> -What I want to say about health care is...<br> while it's vital that every American<br> be covered...<br> it's also vital that we conserve<br> as well as expend.<br> We're providing a safety net<br> for folks on welfare...<br> -Oh, shit.<br> Oh, man...<br> -What did you see?<br> -Nothing. No one.<br> You're missing one of the great<br> assholes of our time.<br> I can't help feeling sad as I<br> listen to Senator Martin.<br> I remember a time when being<br> a Democrat...<br> meant more than just giving welfare<br> recipients a safety net.<br> It meant giving them<br> a ladder...<br> giving them a way to climb<br> back to an equal height.<br> If we don't control spending...<br> and shore up the economy of<br> this country, it will go under.<br> -This is a new economic era.<br> -Who are we shoring the economy up for?<br> Your bond-holding fat cats?<br> No, not just bond holders. Ordinary<br> men and women will benefit, too.<br> Why is he doing this?<br> Because he just has to get on the<br> good side of Lawrence Harris.<br> A lower deficit means<br> working families...<br> will have lower mortgage rates.<br> Okay, not bad, but shut up.<br> Now Governor Nilson's<br> idea has merit.<br> We must provide jobs for<br> those who need work.<br> Jack, excuse me.<br> What, if anything are<br> you against?<br> I'm against doing nothing while<br> people are suffering.<br> I'm against dismissing any idea that<br> might help because it isn't my idea.<br> Senator, you've met<br> these people.<br> Are you saying we do nothing to help<br> unless we come up with it?<br> -Nailed him!<br> -He's toast!<br> What I meant was...<br> -Kicking ass and taking names!<br> -How was it?<br> -You took it. It was yours.<br> Governor... March Cunningham,<br> The Black Advocate.<br> Were you ever arrested during<br> the Vietnam war?<br> No.<br> You weren't arrested in<br> Chicago?<br> No, I was accidentally detained,<br> then released.<br> The record was expunged.<br> How were your released?<br> They realized it was a mistake. It was<br> a long time ago. Check your records.<br> -Come on. We'll be late.<br> You guys go ahead.<br> I'll meet you.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Why is the Black Advocate<br> interested in Stanton?<br> They're not. I am.<br> I'm finding out who he is because<br> a friend works for him.<br> March, don't do this.<br> Aren't you interested, too? Know<br> why he was released? He called...<br> a senator to get him<br> out of jail...<br> then persuaded Mayor Daley to<br> expunge his record.<br> -So?<br> He was already so manipulative in<br> the 60s that he got in bed with...<br> Daley who busted the protestors<br> at the Convention.<br> I don't care. Stanton was never a<br> radical. He's a politician.<br> He couldn't get elected with a<br> record, so he had it expunged.<br> You want to work for that? A man<br> who just wants to get elected?<br> No, I want to work for a man who<br> fights for right, and...<br> -watch a Republican get elected.<br> -Do you know the difference?<br> I know the difference between a<br> man who believes what I do...<br> and lies about it to<br> get elected...<br> and one who doesn't give a<br> fuck. I'll take the liar.<br> -How did he do this to you?<br> -Do what? What are you...<br> Why are you making him into the<br> devil? Get to know him.<br> Spend a few days<br> with us here.<br> I miss you. We could be together.<br> I think you'd fuck me just to get<br> good press for Stanton.<br> We're in trouble.<br> What does she have?<br> Why is the Black Advocate<br> covering Stanton?<br> They're not. It's... she's...<br> It's personal.<br> Don't matter. We're fucked. If<br> some little shitty paper...<br> like the Black Advocate<br> can dig this up...<br> then we're flying blind. They'll<br> all come after us.<br> I mean, did you see any other<br> President there tonight?<br> We're it. We're the fucking<br> ball game.<br> Now every flea that ever nipped his<br> ass will want a piece of us.<br> It'll be the war thing, the drug thing,<br> the woman thing. That's the killer.<br> -You talk to him about that.<br> -Me? No. You're the strategy guy.<br> But you're the body man.<br> We could talk to Susan.<br> Are you out of your<br> fucking mind?<br> "Mrs. Stanton, we need to know<br> who Jack's plugging...<br> -so we can have spin control".<br> -Then let's just quit.<br> If we won't act,...<br> let's work for someone we're not<br> too chicken-shit to protect.<br> Okay, set up a meeting.<br> -Him or her?<br> -Shit, her!<br> Goddamn, this is going<br> to be rough.<br> I have to be in Concord in an hour<br> to meet Jack. What's the crisis?<br> It's campaign business.<br> It's private.<br> Oh, please.<br> Lucille is one of my closest friends<br> and part of this campaign.<br> What's the crisis?<br> You're in the woods,<br> taking a shit...<br> and a wild boar comes<br> charging at you.<br> Do you pull your britches<br> up and run?<br> Or do you try to pull your britches up<br> and grab the doves you just shot...<br> and then try to run, all at<br> the same time?<br> Or do you just forget<br> about the doves...<br> pull your britches up and,<br> because you got no time...<br> to aim and button your fly?<br> And if you miss...<br> you don't want to die with your dick<br> hanging out. See what I'm saving?<br> I think I speak for everyone<br> when I say no.<br> Well, I mean...<br> what if you're not prepared<br> for the boar...<br> get caught with your britches down<br> and lose the doves?<br> What Richard is saying is...<br> if you get caught in the forest...<br> Forget the shit-in-the-woods metaphor.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Okay. Say this boar is part of...<br> I don't believe this.<br> who do the boars represent?<br> The Republicans?<br> -The press.<br> -The press?<br> Yes. Don't they?<br> Yeah, the press.<br> Now, you're dealing with<br> these boars...<br> and suddenly they say things<br> like "Marijuana"...<br> "Chicago." Maybe a woman<br> comes forward...<br> Bullshit. That's not going<br> to happen.<br> -Absolutely not.<br> -I don't think so, either.<br> But...<br> I just want to figure this out.<br> If it did happen...<br> he won't get trapped like Hart,<br> because we know the rules.<br> If some bimbo comes forward,<br> we just say "Bullshit."<br> -Bullshit is right.<br> -What do you suggest we do?<br> -How do we deal with it?<br> -Know more than they do.<br> Be prepared, so when a story hits,<br> we can fight back with the truth.<br> But how can we know what garbage<br> they'll come up with?<br> That's the point, Lucille. That's the<br> whole fucking point.<br> We need to hire an operative<br> to do research.<br> Investigate our lives.<br> Investigate everything... everything<br> anyone could make into an allegation.<br> But we don't play<br> that game.<br> We play the people's game.<br> We say, "The republicans and media<br> want to talk about trash."<br> We talk about your future."<br> We don't shot doves in this<br> campaign. We protect them.<br> What do you mean?<br> Don't the doves represent<br> the people?<br> -No.<br> -Then who are the doves?<br> Forget the doves. Henry, you<br> agree with this?<br> Yes.<br> We'll do it. I'll tell Jack. I<br> want Libby Holden.<br> If we're hiring someone<br> to find the dirt...<br> we must have someone who<br> knows us, who we trust.<br> -Is she out of the hospital<br> -Yes.<br> -And she's okay?<br> -Who is she?<br> She was Jack's chief of staff.<br> She had a breakdown.<br> She suddenly became incoherent<br> during a press conference.<br> She's been in and out of<br> sanatoriums for years.<br> She seems very stable now.<br> You and Henry can fly back<br> and brief her.<br> Well, that's good that<br> she's stable.<br> Because you're putting the<br> campaign in her hands.<br> Yes, I know.<br> That's good.<br> Then are we<br> the doves?<br> I think we're the ones taking<br> the shit in the woods.<br> Henry, I'm just thrilled, thrilled<br> y'all came back.<br> I have a million messages<br> for you.<br> He looks like a band leader.<br> I'm getting rid of it.<br> Henry, How you doing?<br> On behalf of Jack Stanton,<br> thanks for your support.<br> Call them assistants, not<br> secretaries.<br> Jennifer, look who's back.<br> "Shalom"<br> You're working on Friday,<br> wearing a yarmulke?<br> Actually, I'm dressed for work.<br> Hi, H.B.<br> I'm here. Who's going<br> to talk to me?<br> Srta. Holden. Henry Burton.<br> -Hi. I'm Terry Hicks.<br> -Jennifer.<br> -Hi. Lib.<br> -Hi, shit-for-brains.<br> You learned to watch<br> your mouth yet?<br> I will not let you fuck up this<br> campaign, too!<br> That was 20 years ago.<br> Yes, I was thinner then.<br> I had a waist.<br> -Peter Goldsmith.<br> -Ella Louise Harriman.<br> -Where is this happening?<br> -What?<br> The fucking meeting.<br> I'll need a safe house.<br> I know the one.<br> Little. Nice rose garden.<br> Call Becky Raymond.<br> 673-4982.<br> Tell her it's for the Governor.<br> She'll understand. Now, staff.<br> I want her. The one who looks<br> like Winona Ryder.<br> Gorgeous. Is she smart?<br> Oh, she's smart.<br> I want her right away.<br> Start.<br> A Black Advocate reporter dug up<br> the Governor's Chicago arrest.<br> -We can't stop that.<br> But we're concerned there<br> may be other things.<br> -Like Cashmere Mcleod.<br> -Who?<br> You don't know shit, do you?<br> -Susan's hairdresser?<br> -And Jack's porkpie.<br> -What?<br> -Oh, for Christ's sake, act your age.<br> Jack Stanton fucks around<br> and has enemies.<br> But what can Susan's<br> hairdresser do to us?<br> Sell her story to the "Flash"<br> for $150.000...<br> minus the 10% she's giving<br> to the slimesucking...<br> shitty night school attorney<br> who's agenting the deal.<br> -You know this?<br> -No, I imagined it in the booby hatch!<br> -It's bullshit.<br> -In your dreams, sweetheart.<br> She can't hurt us. She's<br> selling a story.<br> She has no proof,<br> no credibility.<br> It's the tip of the iceberg. Jackie's<br> done some pretty stupid things.<br> He's poked his pecker in some<br> sorry trash bins. We have to...<br> stop them before they stop us.<br> Crush them and sweep them up.<br> From now on, you can call me<br> the Dustbuster.<br> You know, honey child... I'm<br> stronger than dirt.<br> I believe you.<br> We could offer her $200,000<br> not to print it.<br> Then kill her to make sure?<br> The important thing is he did<br> nothing wrong.<br> -He should act pissed off.<br> -But not too pissed off.<br> More like, "It's too bad, but we<br> don't take it seriously."<br> "It's not a frightening as thing<br> that happen to real,...<br> people like losing a job.<br> -Where's the light?<br> -I'm looking.<br> "Shit happens, but we're calm<br> in a shit storm."<br> Or maybe, "We expected<br> this kind or crap."<br> Right. The usual media<br> trash bash.<br> But why did he do it? Did he think<br> Cashmere would be so...<br> honored she's never tell?<br> -Maybe it isn't true.<br> -Would it matter?<br> -It'd be better if it wasn't.<br> -Why?<br> Hitler was faithful to Eva Braun.<br> Does that make him better?<br> Or Jefferson or Roosevelt or<br> Kennedy, or any of the...<br> guys who fucked around?<br> But we can't say that<br> in interviews.<br> No. Of course not.<br> Today, a potentially explosive<br> development for Governor...<br> Jack Stanton is this quest for the<br> Democratic presidential nomination.<br> A hairdresser has alleged an affair<br> with the married candidate.<br> The story, unconfirmed, appeared<br> today in the Flash."<br> Stanton has made no statement<br> regarding the woman,...<br> Cashmere McLeod...<br> but the accusation directly<br> follows the disclosure...<br> that Governor Stanton was arrested<br> in 1968 in Chicago.<br> Fucking Eyewitness News.<br> Ted Koppel wants someone<br> for his show.<br> -"60 minutes" too.<br> -Do we have to take this?<br> They're treating this garbage<br> like a real story.<br> We can't ignore it.<br> They could write off Chicago...<br> it was 30 years ago.<br> Or Cashmere... she was paid<br> for her story.<br> But the two, right on top<br> of each other?<br> People will say, "Do we want a radical<br> who messes with hairdressers?"<br> He did not fuck Cashmere<br> McLeod.<br> If you can't handle that fact,<br> leave now.<br> Okay, let's think this through.<br> Who has thoughts about<br> "60 minutes"?<br> I think do it. You agree to<br> all these interviews.<br> Show them we've<br> nothing to hide.<br> And soon, because this<br> will cut into the money.<br> We should act like we<br> expected this...<br> Henry. Sit down, have<br> some coffee.<br> You going to get some<br> sleep tonight?<br> Absolutely. Don't you worry. I was<br> just talking to Danny, here.<br> Danny Scanion, this is my friend,<br> Henry Burton.<br> Can I get you something?<br> Apple fritter?<br> Danny works here every night,<br> 12-hour, $5,25 an hour.<br> Like I was telling the Governor, I don't<br> mind. I'd mind if I couldn't work.<br> -"Apple fritter?"<br> -Not for me.<br> What was the best college game<br> you saw all year?<br> Utah state versus<br> San Diego state.<br> That was a great game. I saw it.<br> Great ground game.<br> You need a good<br> ground game.<br> -"Apple fritter?"<br> -No, I just said...<br> I'll have one, Dan.<br> But just one.<br> I'll make some fresh coffee.<br> -If you want some, you call me.<br> -Thank you, Danny.<br> You look tired, Governor. Maybe<br> it's time to go home.<br> -They'll kill me with trash.<br> -Don't let them.<br> It's my own damn fault. I<br> didn't keep it together.<br> We can still win this thing.<br> We're going to win it.<br> And these problems are nothing<br> compared to what...<br> average folks go through.<br> Losing their jobs, losing their<br> homes. Keep that in mind.<br> Keep the folks in your mind.<br> -It's about them, isn't it?<br> -It's about them. It's about history.<br> That's truer for Susan than for me.<br> It's always been about them.<br> Like this fella, Danny Scanion. He's<br> worked every day since he was 14.<br> Couldn't get insurance, couldn't<br> get his leg fixed right.<br> Doesn't complain. Doesn't do<br> anyone my harm.<br> Aching to do good.<br> God, if you let a man like<br> that go down...<br> you don't deserve to take up<br> space on the planet.<br> We won't let him go down.<br> Bummer. Bummer.<br> What? Libby?<br> -She's got tapes.<br> -Who has tapes?<br> Cashmere, the hair slut, you moron.<br> She's playing them tomorrow.<br> I have no time for ineptitude!<br> Now tell Jack and Susan the cunt has<br> tapes and back to Mammoth Falls.<br> Honey, I have to run.<br> I will. Hold on.<br> The new member of the swimming<br> team wants to talk to you.<br> Hey, Jackie Boy. That's great.<br> You made it.<br> That's great. We're proud of you.<br> No, that's just a bunch of<br> campaign garbage.<br> Governor, this can't wait.<br> We'll call you tonight. I love you.<br> Bye. What is it?<br> Libby says Cashmere McLeod has<br> tapes of you and her talking...<br> on the phone and...<br> she's going to play them<br> tomorrow.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -How bad?<br> -I don't know.<br> -Did you tell her...<br> -Henry, excuse us.<br> -Sure.<br> It's cold here, Sam, but these are<br> friendly people. Reminds me of home.<br> I like her hair that way.<br> It softens her face.<br> Yes. It could be longer, though.<br> If you spent a day with us...<br> you'd see what folks care<br> about is the future.<br> -He's gotten fat.<br> -He jogs, so how much does he eat?<br> And what does he eat?<br> What's he governor of?<br> Let me see... it's<br> not Georgia...<br> not Florida...<br> Sam, I'm not going to dignify<br> that trash.<br> At a time when the American people<br> have a lot to be concerned about...<br> I saw a picture of the hairdresser.<br> Not bad.<br> I don't think this is fair.<br> People suffer and struggle and go<br> through all sorts of things.<br> What matters is, we're still here.<br> If you want to draw a lesson from<br> that about Jack's character...<br> here it is. He will stick.<br> He will work through tough times.<br> He will bust his butt for the<br> American People.<br> "Bust his butt."<br> The mouth on her.<br> He should take her in hand.<br> She's honest. They had problems.<br> Maybe that's when he...<br> screwed the hairdresser.<br> You watching? It's going<br> off now.<br> And we're out. Thanks,<br> everyone.<br> It's over.<br> How'd it play? Wasn't<br> she fantastic?<br> Yeah, great. But they'd like to<br> see hair a little longer.<br> Hey, Henry!<br> -How long are you in town?<br> -Not long.<br> No time to talk. We got to<br> get to Sailor's and...<br> watch Cashmere with<br> an expert.<br> You take care of yourself,<br> dear.<br> I'll be home for dinner. We'll<br> take my truck.<br> So you met Jack and Susan<br> working for McGovern?<br> What were they are?<br> Glorious.<br> Golden. Golden.<br> Did they have any asoir...<br> Please, mister, please...<br> Don't play B17...<br> It was our song,<br> It was our song<br> Sing with me, Henry!<br> Please, mister, please...<br> If you know what I mean...<br> Play that song again.<br> Sailorman!<br> Good to see you, Libby. How<br> was the booby hatch?<br> A better class of drugs than the<br> old days. Where's the beer?<br> Welcome to the world<br> of electronics.<br> Brewski. Here she comes.<br> Recording.<br> I know just what she looked<br> like in high school.<br> I'm Sherman Preslay, Miss<br> Mcleod's attorney.<br> I want to make one<br> thing clear.<br> We'll take no questions until the<br> tapes are played.<br> This will not be an inquisition.<br> Yeah, right. We get<br> the inquisition.<br> The tapes were recorded on Miss<br> McLeod's phone machine.<br> This portion was recorded just<br> before Thanksgiving.<br> Governor Jack Stanton<br> seduced me...<br> and I have tapes to prove it.<br> -I'm on my way to meet the family.<br> -But you said you loved me...<br> You said no one could do the things<br> I did to you. I could come up there.<br> God, what a whiny bitch.<br> Remember that time I met<br> you in Dallas?<br> I get hot just thinking about it.<br> -What you doing this weekend?<br> -Nothing, now that you're leaving.<br> Open a bottle of Chablis. Do you<br> think it's possible to get laid?<br> I'd say it's entirely possible, if<br> you postpone that trip.<br> I'm too homy to think straight.<br> As you can see, these tapes<br> were recorded on...<br> Miss McLeod's phone machine.<br> I'll record the rest of it.<br> Let's go to work.<br> I'll kill him. How could he be so dumb?<br> There are some<br> abrupt cutouts.<br> I'm on my way to meet<br> the family.<br> An abrupt cutout right there.<br> What are you doing<br> this weekend?<br> That's picked up in mid-sentence,<br> or it could be.<br> Open a bottle of Chablis.<br> Do you think it's at...<br> all possible to get laid?<br> That breakup in the middle could<br> be static or they used its to cover.<br> Wait a second. Wait a goddamn<br> second. Play that again.<br> Do you think it' at all possible<br> to get laid?<br> -Again.<br> -Just again. Damn it!<br> -Do you think it's at all...<br> possible to get laid?<br> Yourself.<br> Yourself.<br> Henry, are you cracking up? Two<br> of us would be one too many.<br> Un-fucking-believable!<br> He said, "Do you think it's at all<br> possible to get yourself laid?<br> He said he didn't want me to be<br> too horny to think straight.<br> It was before Thanksgiving. Play<br> it again from the top.<br> Just his lines.<br> Shit!<br> I'm on my way to meet<br> the family.<br> There was an accident, a bender,<br> on the interstate.<br> That's the family he was going<br> to meet. Next.<br> What you doing this weekend?<br> -An abrupt cutout, right?<br> He said, "What are you doing<br> this weekend, Henry?"<br> He called me Henry. I remember the<br> whole call, it meant so much to me.<br> Christ, we got her!<br> You got her. We don't. How<br> do we prove it?<br> Oh, no, no. No, Libby, They...<br> They can't get away with this.<br> This cannot be a world...<br> that lets them get away it.<br> Imagine a black boy saying that.<br> What a privileged life you're had.<br> But never mind about the world.<br> I won't let them get away with it.<br> I'll track down Ted Koppel<br> and Larry King.<br> Can you nail their cellular<br> conversations?<br> I have to rent a van.<br> Sure. We'll pick the best one.<br> Let's go, Henry.<br> We have to change the<br> world now.<br> You asshole! Yes, it was off<br> a cellular phone.<br> But don't pull that outraged<br> puppy shit.<br> You haven't become an innocent<br> just because the tape is phony.<br> I wish we'd castrated you when<br> we had the chance.<br> Libby, you're on a cell phone.<br> Oh, shit!<br> Yes, I'm goddamn sure I<br> know who did it.<br> Yes. I'll get it done.<br> Okay. Bye.<br> You know who did it?<br> Yes. Oh, yes, indeed.<br> A triumphant day, huh, Randy?<br> Perhaps your best ever.<br> -Is that Cashmere on the line?<br> -No.<br> Then say good-bye to<br> Sherman Presley.<br> It's not Sherman Preslay,<br> whoever he is.<br> -You're branched out. Electronics now.<br> -What do you mean?<br> You've been recording your friend<br> Jack's private conversations.<br> Why would I do that? I'm a big<br> Stanton supporter.<br> I always have been.<br> I've been here 20 seconds and you've<br> already exhausted my patience.<br> I want a signed confession.<br> Libby, put that away before you<br> get yourself in trouble!<br> Randy, you human turd...<br> you admit you ambushed Jack<br> Stanton, or you die.<br> -You're crazy!<br> -Certi-fucking-fiably.<br> -At last, a fact!<br> -You'll go to jail, too.<br> I knew nothing about this.<br> He's shocked. He had no idea. Now,<br> are you going to write this out?<br> I don't know what you mean!<br> You know what? I'm going to<br> blow your nuts off.<br> Yes, I am a lesbian. I do not<br> mythologize the male organ.<br> Now, you tiny scumbag,<br> I know you did it.<br> You're on retainer<br> to the Flash.<br> And you, you stupid shit...<br> the crap Jack actually did wasn't<br> enough... you had to embellish it.<br> -Mister, you're about to<br> become missus.<br> You have a choice to make.<br> And quickly.<br> Just how crazy is Libby? And<br> you have to do it now. One...<br> two... This is going to be fun.<br> Okay. Okay. Okay!<br> Very good. Very wise.<br> Now, I want you to be eloquent<br> in this letter.<br> Guilt-ridden about your<br> jealousy and greed.<br> You couldn't live with yourself if you<br> deprived America of this great man.<br> Tonight, an aide of Governor Jack<br> Stanton, is joining us to play a tape.<br> I haven't heard the tape, but<br> my producer has.<br> We'd like to thank her for letting<br> us go on with such...<br> short notice. Here we go.<br> I can be there in 14 minutes.<br> I could come up there.<br> No, I can't wait. I have to<br> have it now.<br> Entirely. I get hot just<br> thinking about it.<br> Look at King. Look at his face.<br> That sounded like me.<br> It was you, asking the head<br> waiter at Caf Des Artistes...<br> to seat you right away because<br> you hadn't eaten all day.<br> -But how...<br> -We recorded it off your cell phone.<br> I'd like to read a letter from the man<br> who did this to Governor Stanton.<br> "To whom it May concern: I am an<br> employee of the Flash"<br> I took innocent statements of<br> Governor Stanton's...<br> off his cellular phone...<br> edited them and paid Cashmere<br> McLeod to pretend...<br> she was talking to him.<br> I did this for my own gain<br> and advancement.<br> I confess it now because I<br> cannot live with the fear...<br> that I may deprive the American<br> people of a great man."<br> Signed, Randy Culligan,<br> Attorney-at-law.<br> Now I think the media owes<br> Governor Stanton an apology...<br> for spreading this unsubstantiated<br> garbage.<br> Very good, girl.<br> It should be harder than this to<br> smear an innocent man.<br> We'll be right back with<br> your phone calls.<br> How did you get my cellular?<br> Henry, well done.<br> I want to thank you all for sticking<br> with us through all this.<br> We haven't much time, but<br> with your help...<br> and the grace of God, we'll get<br> done what needs to be done.<br> It's been pretty awful, but<br> we're still here.<br> It would be easy to get laughs...<br> by doing some cheap blow-dry<br> jokes... so I'll get started.<br> It all started innocently for<br> Governor Stanton.<br> He walked in one day and<br> asked for a little trim.<br> And some longer bangs.<br> They just don't care about<br> the fine points.<br> No, it would ruin the<br> punch line.<br> Does anyone survive one of<br> these feeding frenzies?<br> If they've been around a while,<br> of maybe.<br> But this is the first thing<br> people hear about...<br> Stanton, so he's history.<br> Our the land...<br> of the free...<br> and the home<br> of the brave<br> Thank you, Phil.<br> As head of the Portsmouth<br> Democratic Party...<br> it is my pleasure to introduce...<br> one of the south's most<br> progressive governors...<br> and the husband of one the best<br> fly-fishers I've met.<br> Please welcome Governor<br> Jack Stanton.<br> Thank you for that kind<br> introduction, Tommy.<br> And thank you for the fish.<br> He gave me a big, slab-sided, white<br> bellied fella. Looked a lot like me.<br> Put it on the grill, gave it some heat.<br> Kind of like I'm getting now.<br> Thank you for coming tonight.<br> I know you work hard...<br> and have little time to rest.<br> Some of us got more time<br> than we'd like.<br> Right. I understand.<br> Since this factory closed, how<br> many of you have found work?<br> Raise your hands.<br> How many of you work jobs that<br> just pay the rent, no matter...<br> how many hours you work?<br> My mama worked jobs like that<br> after my daddy died.<br> I remember her coming home from<br> work just bone weary.<br> I know she wanted to play with<br> me and ask me about school.<br> But sometimes you're too tired<br> to do anything but blob...<br> out in front of the tube.<br> You got that right.<br> I don't have to tell you how<br> hard it is to find work...<br> or anything at all about<br> hard times.<br> So I'm going to do something<br> really outrageous.<br> I'm going to tell the truth.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> "He must be really desperate<br> to do that."<br> But if you've had to swallow<br> enough sh... garbage...<br> You can say "shit".<br> We're X-rated.<br> Me too, if you believe<br> the papers.<br> Here's the truth.<br> No politician can re-open this<br> factory or bring back the...<br> shipyard jobs or make your<br> union strong again.<br> No politician can make it<br> the way it was.<br> Because we now live in a world<br> without economic borders.<br> Push a button in New York and<br> a billion dollars moves to Tokyo.<br> In that world, muscle jobs go where<br> muscle labor is cheap,...<br> and that is not here.<br> So to compete, you have to<br> exercise a different muscle...<br> the one between your ears.<br> -He's lost them.<br> -Fuck them. He's got me.<br> The whole country must go<br> back to school.<br> We have to get smarter, learn<br> new skills. And I promise this:<br> I will work hard for you. I will<br> think about you.<br> I will fight to make education a<br> lifetime thing in this country...<br> to give you the support you<br> need to move up.<br> But you have to do the heavy<br> lifting your own selves.<br> Now, I've taken a lot of hits<br> in this campaign.<br> But you know what<br> that means?<br> It means someone thinks you're only<br> interested in that kind of garbage.<br> So Tuesday, when you go to cast<br> your vote, think about that.<br> Think about what you're really<br> interested in.<br> Then pick your candidate.<br> I don't think I'll be able to<br> take it if he loses.<br> If he does lose, maybe we<br> could go away for a while.<br> Try some non-campaign sex.<br> See if it holds up.<br> Goddamn it, Richard, why are<br> you always in my room?<br> Because it's neater.<br> Henry, when this is over, we<br> should work together.<br> Set up a consulting firm.<br> Both of you, enough "when this<br> is over, we are pros" crap.<br> You may be pros, but I'm<br> emotionally involved.<br> -Can I sleep here?<br> -No!<br> Okay, shit.<br> See, a pro knows how to<br> say good-bye..<br> Polls are still open in<br> New Hampshire.<br> Harris is a serious man and<br> has serious things to say.<br> The people recognize that.<br> That's why we going to see some upsets today, but<br> the biggest will be for Jack Stanton.<br> Stanton, like Romney, Muskie and<br> Hart before him, flamed...<br> then burned out. He's just stirring<br> the ashes now.<br> They can't understand why<br> we don't quit.<br> I mean, don't we know<br> we're over?<br> An entire industry of political<br> experts has explained...<br> why we're dead.<br> Why are still walking around?<br> Across the upper Midwest.<br> We predict Lawrence Harris to<br> win in New Hampshire.<br> Well, so what? It's his state.<br> He has to win here.<br> Governor Jack Stanton, who is still<br> campaigning, has decided to...<br> fight right down to the wire and is<br> out on this cold and rainy night...<br> working to get last minute votes.<br> This has been his technique and...<br> many are surprised at how<br> effective it's been.<br> According to exit polls, an<br> overwhelming number...<br> of Stanton voters say that what<br> decided them was actually...<br> meeting the governor.<br> So, we predict Governor<br> Jack Stanton...<br> a close second to<br> Lawrence Harris.<br> I'll be a son of a bitch!<br> Don't be discouraged. We<br> can still win!<br> Are you crazy? Didn't you hear?<br> We're second. We're alive.<br> We're a fucking miracle.<br> We have a chance now,<br> a real chance.<br> If we could just eliminate Harris.<br> -Harris will take Colorado.<br> -And Florida, unless you hit him.<br> I'll get Florida.<br> It's the South.<br> But it's Jewish. You must fire a<br> silver bullet in Florida.<br> Without Harris, we can win.<br> No. Negative will boomerang. I<br> know it. I'm not going negative.<br> For President, Jack Stanton or<br> Lawrence Harris?<br> I served my country in Korea and my<br> boy Jeff fought in the Gulf War.<br> Jack Stanton dodged the<br> Vietnam draft...<br> And covered up his anti-war<br> arrest record.<br> I believe in real solutions and<br> telling the truth.<br> Jack Stanton believes in glib<br> answers to tough question...<br> about his country and himself.<br> I'm Lawrence Harris. I'll fight the<br> tough fights.<br> I won't run away. It's a question<br> of character.<br> Paid for by the Harris for<br> President Committee.<br> Okay. I'm going to kill<br> the bastard.<br> Although I think he's a<br> fine man...<br> and agree we need to lower the<br> deficit, I don't agree...<br> with Senator Harris's...<br> proposal to reduce or even<br> freeze cost of living...<br> adjustments for Social Security.<br> I also disagree with Senator<br> Harris about Medicare.<br> Senator Harris and I also disagree<br> about the Middle East.<br> While in the Senate my opponent<br> cast many votes regarding the...<br> security of the state of Israel.<br> I agree with many of his votes,<br> but some it's important...<br> to stand with our friends.<br> And America has no better friend<br> than the state of Israel.<br> We're up three points<br> and climbing...<br> so a meeting with the Rainbow<br> Coalition might...<br> Who is it?<br> William McCollister.<br> Can I call you back? I'll just<br> be five minutes.<br> You don't remember me,<br> Mr. Burton?<br> Willie, the barbecue place.<br> Come on in.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I figured it would be easier to talk<br> face-to-face with a brother...<br> than to the Gov, even though<br> he's like a brother.<br> I, um... I flew here because my<br> daughter Loretta's with child...<br> and she says Jack Stanton's<br> the daddy.<br> Right.<br> Has he landed yet?<br> He's in the men's room.<br> -Is he alone?<br> -What do you mean?<br> Doesn't matter.<br> -We're in the lead.<br> -Good, good.<br> Harris is second. Actually,<br> undecided's killing everyone.<br> Willie McCollister came to<br> see me last night.<br> His daughter's pregnant and<br> says you're the father.<br> -Who else knows?<br> -He says no one.<br> -What does he want?<br> -I don't know.<br> I just can't catch<br> a break, can I?<br> All right, all right.<br> -Is Willie still here?<br> -No, he went back this morning.<br> I can't leave before the primary. If<br> this gets out, it'll kill us. You...<br> and Howard have to fly back to<br> Mammoth Falls. Talk to him.<br> We have to make sure he knows<br> this is a mistake.<br> They're good people, but not<br> sophisticated. I want them to know.<br> Why pick me? Because<br> I'm black?<br> No. Because Willie<br> picked you.<br> You don't have to talk. Howard<br> knows to say.<br> But you should be there, because<br> he came to you.<br> Governor, if I'm doing this, then<br> there's something I need to know.<br> I am not the father of that child.<br> Henry, you will never have to be<br> ashamed to be part...<br> of this campaign. Understand.<br> You'll never have to swallow it,<br> duck it or apologize for it.<br> I'll make sure that<br> doesn't happen.<br> Guys?<br> Hey, Mr. Burton.<br> Hey, Gov.<br> You remember Howard Ferguson. He<br> works with the Governor, too.<br> What can I do for you?<br> The Governor is very concerned about<br> this situation with your daughter.<br> He'd like to see it resolved as<br> I'm sure you would.<br> He wants her to have an<br> amniocentesis performed...<br> so paternity can be established.<br> A what?<br> It's a medical procedure<br> performed in a hospital.<br> A needle is inserted into<br> the abdomen.<br> Amniotic fluid is draw from<br> your daughter's womb.<br> Genetic material is compared<br> with the Governor's to...<br> to determine if he is the father.<br> I don't understand.<br> Normally it's used to determine<br> fetal health.<br> That's what you'll tell<br> the hospital.<br> You want to make sure the<br> baby's healthy.<br> -A needle?<br> -It's a common procedure.<br> -They'd put a needle her in belly?<br> -Look, Mr. McCollister...<br> some people want to destroy<br> Governor Stanton.<br> He doesn't think you do. But he<br> can't allow this. You can't.<br> I'm sure Loretta's a fine person,<br> but she's a child.<br> And children are<br> impressionable.<br> She ain't said a word to anybody.<br> She's a good girl.<br> I'm sure she is. And the Governor<br> wants to help her...<br> and you, through this. He is<br> prepared to be very generous.<br> He will help provide<br> for the baby.<br> He will do this because he<br> believes you are his friend.<br> But we must resolve this.<br> We must determine that he is<br> not father of that child.<br> I'm sure that you...<br> you know, you understand...<br> our position.<br> Pull over.<br> Pull over.<br> I'm Izzi Rosenblat, with<br> "Schmooze for Jews."<br> My guest today is presidential<br> nominee...<br> and JFK lookalike, Governor<br> Jack Stanton.<br> Jack, when we were<br> talking before...<br> you said your mama<br> liked Vegas.<br> As a tip to our listeners, where<br> does she stay?<br> She's loyal to the<br> MGM Grand.<br> MGM Grand. Listen up,<br> you Vegas fans.<br> And who is her favorite act?<br> Is it Wayne Newton?<br> Absolutely.<br> Everyone loves<br> Wayne Newton.<br> He came on this show. Of course,<br> that was many years ago.<br> Now, to satisfy the curiosity<br> of our Vegas fans...<br> when your mother plays blackjack,<br> where does she stand pat? Sixteen?<br> She's a bit of a gambler. Sometimes<br> she goes up to 17.<br> Oh, my. Excuse me,<br> Governor.<br> I'm told we have Senator<br> Harris on the phone.<br> Hello. This is indeed<br> an honor.<br> Governor Stanton was telling us<br> his mother loves Las Vegas.<br> Does your mother have a favorite<br> vacation spot?<br> My mother's dead.<br> Oh. I'm sorry.<br> And Jack Stanton should be<br> ashamed of his scaring...<br> elderly people down here.<br> You mean about going<br> up to seventeen?<br> I don't follow you.<br> He's telling people I want to<br> cut their Social Security.<br> Larry, it's in your book.<br> You're playing sleazy<br> politics!<br> Izzi, can I speak?<br> Be my guest, governor. What am<br> I saying? You're are my guest!<br> Larry, I'm looking at your campaign,<br> page 18, paragraph 3.<br> It says you want to "study" a freeze<br> of cost of living adjustments.<br> That's one possibility. We might want<br> to rework how they're calculated.<br> Cost of living adjustments are<br> calculated to keep up with inflation.<br> I guess you don't like that.<br> -Wait! I don't say that!<br> -It's in your book.<br> I said it has to be studied.<br> Who knows?<br> We might want to spend more on<br> cost of living adjustments.<br> Senator Harris, Who is your<br> favorite comedian?<br> I'm just telling folks what<br> my positions are.<br> No, you're distorting my positions.<br> That's why no trusts politicians.<br> -You can't defend your positions.<br> -You're playing games.<br> Folks, we can't keep spending<br> money this way.<br> But you just said you might to spend<br> more on cost of living adjustments.<br> No, I, uh...<br> Excuse me. Now listen...<br> Excuse me.<br> What happened? Did he hang up?<br> Yes, yes. Well, so tell me,<br> Governor...<br> who's your favorite comedian?<br> -The phones haven't stopped ringing!<br> -It was fantastic.<br> We couldn't believe it when<br> Harris called. Could we?<br> He's fucked. We'll walk<br> away with Florida.<br> Wait! Turn on CNN.<br> Senator Harris suffered<br> two heart attacks...<br> the first after a phone call with<br> Governor Jack Stanton...<br> during a Florida radio show.<br> Jesus.<br> -Oh, shit. We heard him having it.<br> -He remains in a coma.<br> His condition is critical. But hospital<br> sources will not comment...<br> on the Senator's condition<br> at this point.<br> It's difficult to say what affect this<br> will have on the campaign.<br> The vote's in 2 days.<br> What do we do?<br> Go back to Mammoth Falls. Daisy<br> pulls the negative ads.<br> I understand how<br> you feel, but...<br> We go back to Mammoth Falls.<br> I was so prideful, so<br> fucking smug.<br> You couldn't have known.<br> We were going to win. I could<br> have been gracious.<br> I'm sorry. The man cuts a<br> vicious negative ad...<br> ambushes you on a talk show<br> and calls you sleazy...<br> and you're supposed<br> to be gracious?<br> Is Jackie okay?<br> He's fine. Go on. Don't<br> stop the meeting.<br> Harris is a smart man and he's<br> right about the damn issue.<br> The bastard rubbed your<br> nose in it.<br> And I rubbed his nose back. But<br> that's not how you win the big ones.<br> I don't know what to do now.<br> I guess I'll back tonight, address<br> the victory party.<br> Try to get Mrs. Harris on<br> the phone again.<br> She hasn't returned my phone<br> calls, but you can't blame her.<br> What do you think?<br> What the fuck were you<br> and Howard staring at?<br> Nothing. No one.<br> Bullshit. Who was that<br> woman with Susan?<br> It looked like Fat<br> Willie's wife.<br> Why is she worth staring at?<br> Henry, what the fuck is<br> going on here?<br> Nothing!<br> All right. All right.<br> Son of a bitch! Amniocentesis,<br> you motherfucker!<br> -Susan, I'm sorry.<br> -When were you going to tell me?!<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I know we wish Senator Harris<br> a full and speedy recovery.<br> I think the people of Florida will<br> understand if I forego...<br> any talk of victory or defeat... and<br> ask them to join me in prayer.<br> I know New York. Everything is<br> driven by the tabloids.<br> -Where's Henry? Daisy?<br> -I don't know. I flew in with you.<br> Brad, the New York numbers.<br> You're at 22% and Harris is<br> running at 18%, comatose.<br> -Shit, Henry.<br> -Sorry.<br> How do you think New York will<br> take the thing with Harris?<br> Well, Susan, I think first we have<br> to see if Harris is still in.<br> That's not very helpful. Lucille?<br> Well, if Harris is out and Ozio<br> doesn't jump in...<br> I say we win by default.<br> My God, this poor woman.<br> I want to thank all of you...<br> for your remarkable outpouring<br> of affection.<br> It's obvious my husband will not<br> be able to continue his campaign.<br> Fantastic! I mean, well...<br> you know what I mean.<br> We have asked our good friend<br> former Governor...<br> Fred Picker of Florida.<br> to carry on.<br> To continue to raise questions in<br> a meaningful, honorable way.<br> She's not too upset to<br> give us a poke.<br> Come on. Her husband may be<br> dying and she thinks Jack did it.<br> I turn the campaign over<br> to Governor Picker.<br> Excuse me. This is a rather<br> emotional time.<br> Governor, do you think you can<br> win the nomination?<br> Well, I'm not out to,<br> win the nomination.<br> I'm out to continue what<br> Senator Harris began...<br> to give Americans an honest<br> choice on the issues.<br> But if you won the nomination?<br> It's really premature to talk<br> about that now.<br> I haven't had time to<br> think about it.<br> What I have thought about is the<br> best way I can help Senator Harris.<br> As I know him as a man of<br> action rather than words...<br> the best action is for me to go down<br> and donate a pint of blood,...<br> because that's he needs now.<br> If you want to come with me<br> and donate a pint,...<br> Mrs. Harris would appreciate it.<br> Jesus Christ, we should have<br> thought of that.<br> Great goddamn move.<br> How do we run against this guy<br> if he not going to run?<br> Shit, he'll run. But till he announces<br> it he's the flavor of the week...<br> and golden. We just wait<br> until he comes out.<br> Lawrence Harris made several<br> negative spots.<br> His pollsters have advised more.<br> Will you go in that direction?<br> No. I won't be doing any spots<br> or having any polls,...<br> because I'm not paying<br> any pollsters.<br> I'm not hiring folks to tell me<br> what you're thinking...<br> or how to get at you.<br> Then what are you<br> going to do?<br> Just talk straight.<br> Jesus Christ. Who is this guy?<br> Let's not panic. He's as much as<br> admitted he's running.<br> So now we'll see some tamish<br> on the golden image.<br> The media giveth and...<br> go fuck yourself.<br> Governor, why did you quit<br> politics in 1978?<br> There were a lot of reasons. I<br> had personal problems.<br> This can't be easy to talk about.<br> No, it's not.<br> But I guess it's part of the game<br> now, so I'll be candid.<br> I got too wrapped up in...<br> being governor, and I began to<br> neglect my family.<br> My wife fell in love with<br> another man.<br> I quit, in part to see if I could<br> salvage my marriage...<br> but I couldn't. So then I just<br> wanted to make sure...<br> my boys knew I loved them.<br> I think if you ask them, they'll<br> say we made it through okay.<br> They're in college now and when Mrs.<br> Harris asked me to do this...<br> they were very enthusiastic.<br> I guess you could say...<br> I'm doing this for them, too.<br> Awesome. The best I've<br> ever seen.<br> What do we do?<br> Well, now we panic.<br> Hey, amnio man!<br> God, how in the hell did<br> you find out?<br> Loretta talked to a<br> schoolmate.<br> "A Current Affair" just offered the<br> McCollisters $250,000.<br> Fat Willie threw them<br> off the property.<br> I stashed them in another county.<br> I could kill Jack.<br> He says he's not the father.<br> He's probably not. It<br> doesn't matter.<br> Shit begets shit. Cashmere made<br> anything possible.<br> Didn't she?<br> I'm a good consultant and I know New<br> York, but I'm not a magician.<br> The rumor's about you and<br> the black girl...<br> Say I gave blood to disprove<br> the charge and...<br> we're waiting for the results.<br> Too defensive.<br> And look at the contrast between why<br> you gave blood and why Picker did.<br> I agree. But it might be good to<br> get on some TV shows...<br> like "Oprah" and "Geraldo".<br> You mean strip away those last<br> annoying shreds of dignity...<br> and wallow in trash.<br> Why campaign in New<br> York at all?<br> You can't skip New York.<br> They'll kill me.<br> No, it'll just feel like<br> they have.<br> But you'll survive. We all find<br> a way to survive.<br> That's why I'm so happy to be New<br> York... to have the opportunity to...<br> If you'd just give me<br> a chance.<br> Give me a chance to, to<br> answer your questions.<br> I love New York!<br> Bugger, bugger, bugger!<br> You're a phony! A pederast!<br> You're a sick, hetero fuck!<br> I can't make much of this.<br> Tomorrow we start<br> Connecticut..<br> Picker's speaking at a rally<br> there. We hit it, too.<br> He don't. He's meeting with<br> the Lubavitcher Rebbe.<br> What? Who the fuck<br> decided that?<br> The Rebbe. You can't win<br> New York without him.<br> Norman knows New York.<br> It's his call.<br> Susan's right. You go to the rally.<br> I'll keep the appointment.<br> Thank you. Well, this is kind<br> of overwhelming.<br> He's nervous now. He's<br> the man now.<br> I didn't expect this.<br> And all the folks giving blood<br> in the back...<br> I want to thank them.<br> I really do.<br> Would all of you do<br> me a favor?<br> Don't shout quite so loud.<br> Thanks.<br> I really mean it. I wish everyone<br> would just calm down a little.<br> When I say "everyone", I mean<br> the press and the TV...<br> crews and all my colleagues...<br> and all the people who<br> advise my colleagues.<br> I think we need to calm<br> down some.<br> You know...<br> this is a terrific country.<br> But sometimes we go a little crazy.<br> Maybe that's part of...<br> our greatness, party<br> of our freedom.<br> But if we don't watch out<br> and calm down,...<br> it all may spin out of control.<br> You know, the world is getting more<br> and more complicated.<br> Politicians have to explain<br> things to you...<br> in simpler terms...<br> so that they can get their little<br> oversimplified explanations...<br> on the evening news.<br> And eventually, instead of<br> even trying to explain...<br> they give up and start slinging<br> mud at each other.<br> And it's all to keep you excited,<br> keep you watching...<br> like you watch a... a car<br> wreck or a...<br> wrestling match. That's just what<br> it's like professional wrestling.<br> It's staged and it's fake and it<br> doesn't mean anything.<br> That goes for the debates. We<br> don't hate our opponents.<br> Half the time we don't<br> even know them.<br> But it seems it's the only way we<br> know how to keep you all riled up.<br> So what I want to do is<br> quiet things down...<br> and start having a<br> conversation...<br> about what sort of country we want<br> this to be in the next century.<br> And I want Governor Stanton<br> to know that I...<br> welcome him to this<br> conversation.<br> Okay. This show is yours. You<br> gentlemen know the rules.<br> No eye-gouging, no<br> chair-tossing.<br> Three knockdowns,<br> I stop the bout.<br> I hope he doesn't lose it.<br> Geraldo will go after...<br> him end Picker's smooth.<br> -He won't lose it.<br> -He doesn't have anything to lose.<br> Is there any truth whatsoever...<br> to the awful allegation that you<br> are the father of a...<br> child by a teenage girl?<br> Oh, shit.<br> No, it's good it's out there. Now, if<br> Jack just keeps the answer short...<br> by the publicity over the phony<br> Cashmere McLeod tapes.<br> Her family are good people.<br> They're my friends.<br> I just spoke with the father...<br> and he apologized for causing<br> me so much trouble.<br> I think that's all we need to know,<br> Jack. Right, folks?<br> Jesus Christ. Picker actually saved<br> him. I've never seen that before.<br> Maybe this is the first time. Maybe<br> Picker's the real thing.<br> You know what your problem is,<br> Hotchkiss? You got galloping TB.<br> You don't mean tuberculosis,<br> right?<br> No, I mean True Believerism. You<br> talk and act like a pro...<br> but inside you're just like Libby,<br> who actually goes crazy...<br> when her candidate turns<br> out not to be a rock.<br> In '78, she actually wore a<br> button that said...<br> "I'm Picker person" and nose<br> dived when he quit the race.<br> -Didn't even try to find out why...<br> -He told us why.<br> What? He wanted to stay<br> home with his kids?<br> "I'd rather be dad than president"?<br> Give me a break.<br> The race among Democratic<br> contenders is still a toss-up.<br> Polls taken after both men<br> appeared on "Geraldo"...<br> indicate that governor Picker...<br> has a substantial lead...<br> but there has been a remarkable 5%<br> increase for Governor Stanton.<br> Fucking Norman Asher.<br> I'm taking a leave of absence.<br> I can't stay and take...<br> orders from Norman Asher.<br> We're from different parts of the<br> jungle. The thing's...<br> about gone anyway.<br> I can't believe this.<br> Why? Henry, I've been through<br> this shit a hundred times.<br> These guys love you then they<br> stop loving you.<br> Yeah, but Stanton's different.<br> Yeah, he's different.<br> He was worth it.<br> You take care of your ass,<br> Hotchkiss.<br> I'll see you next time.<br> I'm sorry about losing<br> Daisy and Richard...<br> but we're pros and these<br> things happen.<br> Now, I want to talk about something<br> Richard said about Picker...<br> that I want to find out.<br> Why did Picker quit in '78?<br> AII I heard about was a<br> condo development...<br> named Clearwater Estates...<br> where the state and county matched<br> funds to build a connecting road.<br> And?<br> Nothing specific.<br> The project developer was a guy<br> named Edgardo Reyes.<br> Edgardo Reyes is the brother<br> of Antonia Reyes.<br> Picker's former wife. Did anyone<br> ever follow this up.<br> No.<br> Well, Libby, let's go.<br> What?<br> What?<br> -I'm trying to decide.<br> -Decide what?<br> If I want to do this, you<br> stupid shit!<br> I protected you. I don't do<br> in the opponent.<br> What is the difference?<br> All the difference in the world.<br> All the moral difference.<br> I'm not too interested in tearing<br> Fred Picker down.<br> -And if he's bad?<br> -It'll out.<br> But when? Say he wins<br> the nomination...<br> and then it comes out. Now,<br> look at this.<br> Results of the blood test<br> Dr. Beauregard gave me.<br> Congratulations. I'm sure<br> this will help.<br> But it won't.<br> You know it. It won't matter my blood<br> doesn't match Loretta's baby's.<br> It won't matter I can't<br> be the father.<br> It would only matter if I were<br> the father. Because...<br> guilt is what's interesting.<br> Am I supposed to accept this and<br> let Picker slide in...<br> because you were a "Picker Person"<br> in the 70s?<br> You mean injustice for all?<br> That's a stupid argument!<br> Okay, but this isn't.<br> Picker could be guilty of fraud.<br> If he used influence to help<br> his brother in-law,...<br> he can't be president.<br> He could be a real shit.<br> Forget who you thought he was. You<br> most find out who he really is.<br> Get packed.<br> We are in limbo now,<br> Henry.<br> We are outside the<br> mainstream.<br> We are in purgatory.<br> We are lost.<br> Libby, if you don't shut up,<br> I'm going to kill myself.<br> We are testing our limits.<br> We are in the pits.<br> Remember the words to<br> "Limbo Rock"?<br> "How low can you go"?<br> Is there a reason we're meeting in<br> Neo Bwanaland and not his office?<br> Two reasons... no recording devices,<br> and I've always...<br> wanted to see this hotel.<br> Yes, in my work, I'd hoped being<br> the Governor's brother-in-law...<br> would be an advantage.<br> But Mr. Righteous wouldn't<br> cut me any slack.<br> We did Clearwater<br> straight up.<br> It would be God's joke if he<br> got nailed for it anyway.<br> Freddy didn't know you hired his<br> wife and brother to get to him?<br> Know? Absolutely not.<br> Thank you, Mr. Reyes. My friend<br> and I are very, very grateful.<br> Know?<br> what did he know? He was half<br> stoned most of the time?<br> Stoned?<br> Oh, dear. I said something<br> I said shouldn't have.<br> Freddy's staff don't like<br> to hear that.<br> Stoned how?<br> "Toot-toot-tootsie,<br> good bye."<br> You don't know he was a fucking<br> maricon cokehead?<br> -Cocaine.<br> -He loved the shit.<br> We all did, but he's the only one<br> who's a candidate for sainthood.<br> I'm afraid that's a little hard to<br> buy. It just doesn't fit.<br> Maybe not now. Twenty<br> years ago...<br> everyone did everything.<br> Right, Libby?<br> But where did he score? How<br> could he keep it quiet?<br> There was a guy. A young guy,<br> Lorenzo Delgado.<br> Upper-class Cuban, a lawyer.<br> He and the Governor know each other<br> socially. So it was all right.<br> The joke is that Delgado just<br> got out of prison...<br> and lives in a halfway<br> house in Hialeah.<br> And saint Freddy is about<br> to be president.<br> Yeah, that is a joke. You must get<br> a lot of laughs telling it at parties.<br> I don't talk about Freddy.<br> I'm talking to you because<br> you're from his campaign.<br> It's just...<br> I'm not the only guy<br> who knows this.<br> He should never have<br> returned to the game.<br> Now he'll go down.<br> This is America.<br> You can bank on it.<br> Lorenzo Delgado.<br> On the porch, through there.<br> Lorenzo?<br> Right in there.<br> Sr. Delgado?<br> We're here about<br> Freddy Picker.<br> sit down, sit down.<br> Are you from the campaign?<br> I've been expecting you.<br> Tell Freddy he has nothing to fear<br> from me. Nothing, you understand?<br> This happened after him.<br> I fucked my brains out in jail.<br> Nothing else to do.<br> And there were so many boys<br> spent all day in the gym...<br> working out.<br> I like this porch.<br> I can't do it all the time.<br> Depends on the weather.<br> It's strange.<br> My body temperature<br> is always off.<br> Too hot or too cold.<br> It's never just right.<br> Sometimes the tiniest breeze<br> can start me shivering.<br> I can't do anything about it.<br> I can't turn it off. I just<br> have to let it ride.<br> So, are you Freddy's<br> friend now?<br> You just knew it would<br> be good.<br> You knew it would be irresistible.<br> But this has every fucking thing.<br> Sex, drugs, corruption.<br> And none of it-none of it, Henry,<br> my man-is-clear-cut venality.<br> It's all kind of human and<br> awful and sad.<br> So now we'll find out.<br> Find out what? We just<br> found out.<br> Don't play dumb with me.<br> This is a test...<br> of us and them. Actually, of us<br> and them, and us again.<br> I mean, we got the dirt.<br> Now it's about them-back and<br> Susan. What will they do with it?<br> Isn't that what we're both<br> really after here?<br> After 20 fucking years, I get to<br> see what they're about.<br> Not just hypothesize, not just<br> hope. This is it!<br> Graduation day. They<br> graduate, or I do.<br> Be honest. Isn't that what<br> you're really after, too?<br> Watch the road!<br> Isn't it?<br> Feast your eyes, Governor.<br> You too, m'lady.<br> Henry, a transcript of our tour.<br> Well, this... this is<br> remarkable.<br> How did he think he could<br> get away this?<br> What do we do with it?<br> The Times... No, the Wall Street<br> Journal more authoritative.<br> Through an intermediary, someone not<br> connected to the campaign.<br> -I don't think so.<br> -what do you mean?<br> I mean there's nothing<br> of use here.<br> You must be kidding.<br> Nope. It doesn't meet<br> my standards.<br> What do you mean?<br> Henry and I don't the use of<br> this material is proper.<br> We have a moral objection. And<br> I have an historical beef.<br> Come on. Why get it if you<br> weren't going to use it?<br> As Susan said, he could<br> have been a shit.<br> He isn't, but he could<br> have been.<br> But you're off the point. The point<br> is we don't do this sort of thing.<br> I'll relentless busting dust<br> and guarding your ass.<br> I'd have shot Randy Collegian's<br> weenie off for you.<br> Well, maybe I would have.<br> But this is something else. This is<br> hurting someone. This sucks.<br> You want to know why this sucks?<br> Because you told me.<br> Remember when, Jackie?<br> Let me refresh your memory.<br> -Weren't they gorgeous?<br> -But look at you.<br> You little shit. I told you I<br> used to have a waist.<br> Hush up. Don't ruin it. You<br> remember when this was?<br> You don't, do you?<br> Miami headquarters in '72.<br> This was taken just after<br> the convention.<br> I'll never forget that convention.<br> Libby, for Christ's sake,<br> what's the point?<br> The point is Eagleton.<br> Remember, Jack? I must have known<br> you, what, two days then?<br> We hear that McGovern had chosen<br> a vice president who...<br> had electric shock therapy.<br> And I consider the possibility that we<br> might lose to that fuckbrain Nixon.<br> Before that, I was absolutely<br> convinced we would win.<br> Can you imagine, Henry?<br> We were so fucking young.<br> And this one, he<br> takes me out.<br> We go to an outdoor Cuban joint.<br> Remember, Jack?<br> My head's in my hands. I mean,<br> life has ended.<br> I say, "They did it! The CIA."<br> I couldn't believe that Tom Eagleton<br> would really be a nutcase.<br> They had to have take him and<br> made him crazy.<br> It couldn't be that McGovern<br> was a complete amateur!<br> I said to Jack: "We got to get<br> same capability as the CIA."<br> Remember, Jack? "We have<br> to do dirt, too."<br> And you said, "No. Our job is<br> to end all that."<br> "Our job is to make it clean.<br> Because if it's clean, we win."<br> "Because our ideas are better."<br> You remember this, Jack?<br> That was a long time ago.<br> Libby, you said it yourself.<br> We were young. We didn't know<br> how the world worked.<br> Now we know.<br> If we don't move on this Picker<br> situation, two things will happen.<br> First. We're dead.<br> Everything we've worked for since<br> Miami 25 years ago dies, and fast.<br> The second thing that happens is<br> someday, soon when they're sick of...<br> Picker's quiet, righteous act<br> some intrepid journalist...<br> will stumble onto this.<br> And if he doesn't, the Republicans<br> will lead him to it next fall.<br> It will be like Eagleton, only it'll be<br> our fault this time...<br> for letting it happen.<br> Your fault, Libby.<br> Honey, you may be right.<br> All of it may be right.<br> But we can't do it because it ain't<br> who we're supposed to be.<br> We could leak part of it...<br> the Clearwater.<br> The Republicans know that.<br> And they won't get the rest soon?<br> You think Reyes will...<br> only tell this story once?<br> I'm sorry, Libby. There's<br> no discussion.<br> You're right, none.<br> Henry and I decided.<br> This dies here.<br> I don't think so.<br> I'm sorry, sweetheart,<br> but it does.<br> And here's why.<br> Know what this is? Test results<br> on Jack's blood and Uncle...<br> Charlie's blood taken<br> over the years.<br> And this is the report Jack gave<br> me that proves he...<br> didn't father Loretta's baby.<br> And you know what, Jack?<br> It's not your blood.<br> Isn't that a riot?<br> The blood Dr. Beauregard took<br> wasn't from you...<br> it was from Uncle Charlie.<br> You sent him in your place<br> because Dr. Beauregard loves...<br> you and wants to "teach those<br> Yankees a lesson."<br> He doesn't love you enough<br> to lose his license.<br> Once he knows I have proof,<br> he'll fold.<br> That won't prove you're the<br> father of Loretta's baby.<br> In fact, I think you're not.<br> But it proves you thought<br> you might be.<br> And that proves you fucked her. And<br> that will kill your chances.<br> You would do that? You would<br> end his political career?<br> You see, Jack?<br> She hasn't even heard.<br> She isn't even upset that you fucked<br> your 17-year-old babysitter.<br> And you know why? It's never the<br> cheat who goes to hell.<br> It's always the one who<br> he cheated on.<br> That's why you still talk in that<br> tender voice about...<br> being in it for the folks and...<br> Susan can only talk in that voice from<br> hell about your political career.<br> Now what kind of shit is that, Jack!<br> Oh, excuse me. I forgot.<br> It's the same old shit The shit no<br> one ever calls you on, ever..<br> Because you are so completely<br> fucking special!<br> Because everyone was always<br> so proud of you.<br> Me, too. Me, the worst.<br> It's just makes it a lot easier<br> for me. I mean,...<br> it's totally depressing.<br> What have I been doing this for my<br> whole, pathetic, fucking life?!<br> So, here's the deal. If you move on<br> Freddy Picker, who I think we...<br> all agree is a flawed, but decent<br> man, I move on you.<br> Yes...<br> I will destroy this village<br> in order to save it.<br> Tomorrow we...<br> Is that for me?<br> No, darling.<br> Where are we?<br> Coming up to my beautiful<br> condo by the river.<br> You want to come in for some<br> coffee? Booze? Diet Coke?<br> No, darling.<br> Deliver this for me, will you?<br> I'm not going to use it.<br> You're giving them the<br> blood test info?<br> Why not? Picker will go down<br> anyway. We can't save him.<br> The point of this was to see if they'd<br> turn him in, and they will.<br> They didn't even fucking hesitate.<br> So that's that.<br> Let them swing, Libby, Let<br> them sweat a little.<br> Oh, honey.<br> You see that moon?<br> That's me. It's beautiful, huh?<br> But Henry...<br> it's only reflected light.<br> It needs the sun.<br> The Stanton are my sun.<br> I lived my life drawing light<br> and warmth from them.<br> Without them, I'm bleak<br> and cold...<br> and airless for eternity.<br> You be careful, Henry.<br> You have something of<br> an atmosphere.<br> Just find yourself a life, Okay?<br> Go home now.<br> Try to get some sleep.<br> Can you find your way<br> from here?<br> Oh, sure.<br> From here? There are only two<br> ways you can go from here.<br> Bye, sweetie.<br> God, no, no.<br> No, she's a very close friend of<br> mine. Let me through.<br> A lot of us grew up with<br> Libby Holden.<br> She was our friend,<br> our big sister...<br> she bullied us, she<br> drove us crazy.<br> And, she remembered<br> everything about us.<br> Everything that we hoped to be,<br> everything we wanted the world to be.<br> All those young promises made, Libby<br> remembered in the original wording.<br> Before she died, she<br> wrote me a note.<br> It said:<br> "I am so fucking disappointed<br> in you."<br> "Shape up."<br> I am so sorry that I<br> disappointed her.<br> I am so sorry that I can't<br> look at her and say...<br> that I will promise to<br> do better.<br> She lent us her courage<br> and her warmth...<br> and her madness.<br> She had the most<br> amazing heart.<br> Long trip.<br> No press that I can see.<br> Not yet.<br> Follow me Governor.<br> This is only copy left.<br> It might help you know what<br> someone else may find.<br> I shouldn't have looked for it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Fucking cocaine.<br> I was really so successful<br> in everything I did...<br> business, politics.<br> I could handle anything...<br> except cocaine.<br> But I didn't know that<br> because of cocaine.<br> That's what fucked up my<br> marriage, not anything else.<br> And...<br> I did go to bed with Lorenzo<br> once or twice.<br> It was a coke thing. I could do<br> anything, so I did that, too.<br> I'm seeing a really<br> nice woman now.<br> I suppose I have to tell her.<br> Hell of a price to pay,<br> isn't it?<br> Well, maybe no one<br> will find out.<br> Well, you did... in a day.<br> I should never have said yes<br> to Mrs. Harris, but...<br> I thought I'd give it a week,<br> and it just took off.<br> Once I did that blood thing...<br> It was great politics.<br> Yeah, amazing, wasn't it?<br> Jack, thank you for coming here.<br> The honorable way you're...<br> I was wrong to stay in. I just hope<br> when I quit, they won't hit it as hard.<br> And my boys...<br> I don't want them to<br> know about Lorenzo.<br> But probably the bottom line is<br> I'm going to be a national joke.<br> And I'll have to explain it to<br> my boys, either way.<br> Because no matter<br> what I do...<br> the press will find out<br> the rest, won't they?<br> If they think it will sell one<br> newspaper, yes.<br> Oh, my God.<br> If there's anything I can do, anything<br> to make it a little better...<br> I can still hear the soft<br> summer wind...<br> In the live oak trees<br> And those Williams boys...<br> They still mean a lot to me<br> Hank e Tennessee.<br> I guess we're all gonna be.<br> So what do you with good<br> ol'boys like me?<br> I love that song... the line about<br> the Williams boys.<br> It's never just Hank. The picture's<br> not complete without Tennessee.<br> Governor, I'm resigning from<br> the campaign.<br> I don't accept your resignation.<br> I don't feel comfortable<br> about this anymore.<br> -About what?<br> -This.<br> This line of work.<br> I spoke to Richard. He's<br> back on board.<br> I'm putting him in charge...<br> campaign manager.<br> I'm bringing Daisy back, too.<br> -That's not what this is about.<br> -Then what is it?<br> Libby.<br> Her test. You flunked it.<br> But just now I passed it. So<br> which grade do I get, Henry?<br> If she hadn't died...<br> Then I'd have leaked the file<br> and felt bad about it.<br> But I'd have been<br> wrong not to.<br> What I did now, I did for Libby.<br> But it wasn't right.<br> If Picker hadn't quit, he'd have<br> taken the party down with...<br> him. Just a matter of when.<br> And how. And who took<br> him down.<br> Those are fine points,<br> Henry.<br> They're "how many angels fit<br> on the head of a pin points."<br> This is hardball. Do you mean you just<br> realized that and can't handle it?<br> I know you better<br> than that.<br> This is it, Henry. This is the<br> price you pay to lead.<br> You don't think Lincoln was a<br> whore before he was president?<br> He had to tell his stories and<br> smile his back-country grin.<br> He did that so one day<br> he'd have the opportunity...<br> to stand before the nation and<br> appeal to our better nature..<br> That's where the bullshit stops.<br> That's what it's all about.<br> Making the most of it,<br> doing it the right way.<br> You know that there are plenty<br> of people in this game...<br> who don't think that way.<br> They'll sell their souls lie<br> to people, divide them,...<br> play on their fears,<br> for nothing.<br> Just for the prize.<br> I don't care.<br> I'm sorry, but I'm not<br> comparing the players.<br> I don't like the game.<br> I want to work for something<br> small, like voter registration.<br> And after that, who do<br> they vote for?<br> Who can do this<br> better than me?<br> Is there anyone else who can win<br> this election... who'd do more...<br> for people than I would? Who'd<br> think about the folks I care about?<br> Oh, shit!<br> They're here so quick?<br> That driver. I knew it.<br> Okay. We'll go talk to them<br> together. Come on.<br> Don't shake your head, Henry. We<br> worked so hard together to get here.<br> It's there for us now.<br> We can do incredible things. We<br> can change this whole country.<br> I'm going to win this. And when I do,<br> we're going to make history.<br> Look at me and tell me it's<br> not going to happen.<br> Look at me and tell me you<br> don't want to be part of it.<br> Jesus, Henry!<br> You want me to beg? I can't do it<br> without you. Don't leave me now.<br> You're still with me, aren't you?<br> Say you are. Say it.<br> come on, Henry! This is ridiculous.<br> You have to be with me!<br> Congratulations.<br> Congratulations.<br> Now don't break<br> our hearts.<br> Mazel tov, Mr. President.<br> Mr. President.<br>
