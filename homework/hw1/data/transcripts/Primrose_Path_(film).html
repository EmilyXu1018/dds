It's another kind of pain.<br> Oh, well. "we live not as<br> we wish to, but as we can."<br> So sayeth my old friend<br> menander here.<br> Who was it that said it?<br> Menander, darling<br> - one of those old greek philosophers.<br> Hmm.

Hawkins.<br> Tell you about it later.<br> Did you go<br> to the fair, ma?<br> Oh, boy, did i! Say, I've<br> been jounced and bounced<br> till I don't think there's<br> a whole bone left in my body.<br> Look!<br> A monkey in a pineapple!<br> Oh, ma,<br> ain't it cute?<br> Ain't it cute?<br> It looks like Homer.<br> Aw, let him be.<br> Well, its eyes light up.<br> It does look like Homer,<br> especially when<br> he hits the bottle.<br> Oh, Ellie May, ain't you<br> pleased with your present?<br> Sure,<br> I'm pleased, ma.<br> Well, how can you tell if<br> you don't even look at it?<br> I'm going down to the<br> beach to get some clams.<br> Now, there you are, ma.<br> Here I buy her<br> the best pair of silk<br> stockings I can for the money,<br> and she don't even<br> look at 'em.<br> I'll look<br> at 'em after.<br> You're pretty<br> particular about<br> where your presents<br> come from.<br> I ain't said nothin'.<br> Good-bye, ma. Good-bye.<br> Silk stockings'<br> ain't for a girl<br> that acts<br> like a boy.<br> You should've bought her a baseball bat.<br> I don't want none.<br> You got 8 pounds there. All right.<br> Here she comes.<br> Are you going<br> to say it?<br> I'm not afraid of her.<br> I'll say it.<br> Go on, say it.<br> Afraid of a girl?<br> I'm not<br> afraid of her!<br> Well, then I'll say it!<br> her mother was a lady-<br> yeah, you missed!

Sure.<br> Say, got some coffee, hon?<br> I'll make you a fresh cup.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Say,<br> is this genuine?<br> Say, nothing else but.<br> That fella must have<br> an oil well somewhere.<br> Say, ma, listen. Say, I says<br> to him, I said, "mr. Hawkins,<br> "if you want to throw your money<br> away, it's all right with me.<br> I ain't gonna be<br> the one to stop you."<br> And, ma, confidential-<br> he wanted to marry me.<br> No!<br> He did!<br> And I says, "now,<br> look here, mr. Hawkins,<br> one husband at a time's<br> enough, ain't it?"<br> And he laughed<br> fit to kill.<br> He must be a god.<br> Oh, he's a god<br> and very refined.<br> It's too bad Homer<br> don't do you a favor<br> and get run over<br> or something.<br> Oh, ma. Poor Homer. Somebody<br> has to look after him.<br> And of course it's got to be you. Sure.<br> Isn't it customary for a wife<br> to look after her husband when he's ill,<br> instead of chasing<br> around with other men?<br> Hello, Homer.<br> Are you still alive?<br> Ain't you feeling<br> well, baby?<br> Look at them eyes. Looks<br> like a couple of grapes<br> floating around<br> in his head.<br> You might reserve<br> your acid wit<br> for someone<br> of your own class.<br> Wasn't no drunks<br> in my family.<br> One tiny virtue<br> is not sufficient<br> to counteract your<br> other endowments.<br> Big words ain't<br> going to help that hangover.<br> Ma, leave him be. Come<br> on, now. That's a good boy.<br> That's it.<br> That's a boy.<br> There.<br> Oh. Working on<br> your book, Homer?<br> What difference does<br> that make to you?<br> I was telling mr. Hawkins, a friend<br> of Thelma's, what a smart man you was.<br> You don't have to<br> further my humiliation.<br> Why, Homer, nobody's<br> humiliating nobody.<br> Who is this Hawkins? What kind<br> of a woman is your friend Thelma?<br> Where have you been?<br> What have you been doing?<br> I've been to the fair<br> and had some fun.<br> Don't you want your Mamie<br> to have a good time?<br> Look, Mamie, I...<br> oh, my poor Homer.<br> Eyes are all red<br> and watery.<br> My eyes are red<br> with shame.<br> Why, Homer, you ain't done<br> nothin' to be ashamed of.<br> Slinking up back alleys with my<br> collar turned up to hide my disgrace.<br> Now, honey-bun, you know how<br> upset you get after drinking.<br> I can't stand it<br> any longer.<br> I'll put an end to myself<br> - that's what I'll do.<br> Homer, you give that to me.<br> Give it right to me.<br> I only gave it to you because<br> you was afraid of burglars.<br> Now, you mustn't<br> play with it.<br> Someday I'll do it. Someday<br> I'll have the courage.<br> Now, don't you want your<br> Mamie to rub your head for you,<br> like a good<br> little boy?<br> I'm not a little boy.<br> I'm ill!<br> Why, of course you are.<br> You're a great big boy.<br> Oh, dear. Poor Homer.<br> Ain't got no gin left.<br> That's what's<br> the matter with you.<br> The big bad gin's<br> all gone, ain't it?<br> Well, Mamie'll<br> get you some money<br> so you can buy<br> some more.<br> I won't take any money!<br> I won't take<br> money from you!<br> Why don't you go out and get a job-<br> get some money<br> of your own?<br> The work Homer does<br> takes brains.<br> They'll never<br> read his book,<br> even if he does<br> finish it.<br> Now, here you are, Homer.<br> Take it and have a good time.<br> I'll take it.<br> And I hope you enjoy<br> my degradation.<br> It's all right<br> with me, toots.<br> Now, Homer, don't get tight and fall<br> in a ditch like you done the last time.<br> If he fell in the ditch<br> and I was along,<br> I'd just cover him up<br> and let him lay.<br> Going down<br> to the beach?<br> Yeah. Why?<br> Hop in, and I'll<br> give you a ride.<br> I ain't<br> takin' no chances.<br> You don't have<br> to be scared<br> of a silly old man<br> like me.<br> Oh, I ain't<br> exactly scared.<br> Hop in, then.<br> I'm just hankering<br> to have a talk<br> with somebody.<br> Well...<br> I ain't got much<br> to talk about.<br> You don't have<br> to worry.<br> I'll do<br> all the talking.<br> Get down<br> to the beach often?<br> Going fishing?<br> Nope. Clamming.<br> Oh, you like<br> to eat clams?<br> I ain't gonna train 'em<br> for no circus.<br> That's what I get<br> for being nosy.<br> Why don't you buy 'em in<br> town? Save you a long trip.<br> They got to be fresh on<br> account of my sister Honeybell.<br> What's the matter<br> with her?<br> She's sick.<br> If they ain't fresh,<br> she might get<br> an awful sick stomach.<br> Oh, I'm sorry<br> to hear about that.<br> Do you live<br> down at the beach?<br> Yeah. I run<br> a hamburger stand<br> down by<br> the fish canneries.<br> Hmm. Funny. I was going to have<br> my lunch down at the beach today,<br> but I forgot<br> my pocketbook.<br> Maybe I could<br> fix you up.<br> Oh, I didn't<br> mean it that way.<br> That's all right.<br> Why ain't you at school?<br> Don't have to be.<br> Why not?<br> I get my learnin'<br> from my pa.<br> Is he a schoolteacher<br> or something?<br> No. He went to college.
