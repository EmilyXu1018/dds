                        You never did eat your lunch,<br> did you?<br> I better get back to the office.<br> These extended lunch hours...<br> give my boss excess acid.<br> Why don't you call your boss<br> and tell him...<br> you're taking the rest<br> of the afternoon off?<br> It's Friday anyway,<br> and hot.<br> What do I do with my free afternoon?<br> Walk you to the airport?<br> Well, we could laze<br> around here a while longer.<br> Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.<br> Hotels of this sort aren't<br> interested in you when you come in...<br> but when your time is up...<br> Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you<br> in a place like this.<br> I've heard of married couples who<br> deliberately spend a night...<br> in a cheap hotel.<br> When you're married you can do<br> a lot of things deliberately.<br> You sure talk like<br> a girl who's been married.<br> Oh, Sam, this is<br> the last time.<br> - Yeah? For what?<br> - For this.<br> For meeting you in secret<br> so we can be secretive.<br> You come down here<br> on business trips...<br> and we steal lunch hours.<br> I wish you<br> wouldn't even come.<br> What do we do instead?<br> Write each other lurid love letters?<br> Oh, I have to go, Sam.<br> - I can come down next week.<br> - No.<br> Not even just to see you?<br> Have lunch in public?<br> Oh, we can see each other.<br> We can even have dinner.<br> But respectably.<br> In my house with my mother's<br> picture on the mantel and...<br> my sister helping me broil<br> a big steak for three.<br> And after the steak, do we<br> send sister to the movies...<br> turn Mama's picture to the wall?<br> Sam!<br> All right.<br> Marion, whenever it's possible,<br> I want to see you.<br> And under any circumstances,<br> even respectability.<br> You make respectability<br> sound disrespectful.<br> I'm all for it. It requires patience,<br> temperance, a lot of sweating out.<br> Otherwise, though,<br> it's just hard work.<br> But if I can see you and touch you<br> even as simply as this, I won't mind it.<br> I'm tired of sweating<br> for people who aren't there.<br> I sweat to pay off my father's<br> debts, and he's in his grave.<br> I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,<br> and she's living...<br> on the other side of the world.<br> I pay too.<br> They also pay<br> who meet in hotel rooms.<br> A couple of years and<br> my debts will be paid off.<br> If she ever remarries,<br> the alimony stops.<br> - I haven't even been married once yet.<br> - But when you do, you'll swing.<br> Oh, Sam, let's get married.<br> And live with me in a storeroom<br> behind a hardware store in Fairvale?<br> We'll have lots of laughs.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> When I send my ex-wife her alimony,<br> you can lick the stamps.<br> I'll lick the stamps.<br> You want to cut this off, go out<br> and find yourself somebody available?<br> I'm thinking of it.<br> How could you even<br> think a thing like that?<br> - Don't miss your plane.<br> - We can leave together, can't we?<br> Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,<br> you have to put your shoes on.<br> Isn't Mr Lowery<br> back from lunch?<br> He's lunching with the man who's<br> buying the Harris Street property.<br> The old lease man. That's why<br> he's late. You got a headache?<br> It'll pass.<br> Headaches are like resolutions...<br> you forget them<br> as soon as they stop hurting.<br> Have you got some aspirin?<br> I've got something, not aspirin.<br> My mother's doctor gave them to me<br> the day of my wedding.<br> Teddy was furious when he found out<br> I'd taken tranquillizers.<br> Any calls?<br> Teddy called me. My mother<br> called to see if Teddy called.<br> Oh, your sister called to say she's<br> going to Tucson to do some buying...<br> - and she'll be gone the whole weekend...<br> Wow. It's as hot<br> as fresh milk.<br> Hey, you girls oughta get your boss<br> to air condition ya up.<br> He can afford it today.<br> Marion, will you get the copies<br> of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.<br> Oh... Oh, not you.<br> My daughter.<br> A baby.<br> Tomorrow she stands her sweet self<br> up there and gets married away from me.<br> - I want you to take a look at my baby.<br> Eighteen years old...<br> and she never had an unhappy day<br> in any one of those years.<br> Come on, Tom.<br> My office is air conditioned.<br> Do you know what I do<br> about unhappiness?<br> I buy it off.<br> Are, uh...<br> Are you unhappy?<br> Uh, not inordinately.<br> I'm buying this house<br> for my baby's wedding present.<br> Forty thousand<br> dollars cash.<br> Now that's...<br> that's not buying happiness.<br> That's just buying off unhappiness.<br> I never carry more than<br> I can afford to lose.<br> - Count 'em!<br> - I declare!<br> I don't. That's how<br> I get to keep it.<br> Tom, a cash transaction<br> of this size is most irregular.<br> Ah, so what?<br> It's my private money.<br> - Now it's yours.<br> - Suppose we put it in the safe...<br> and then Monday morning<br> when you're feeling good...<br> Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's<br> that bottle you said was in your desk?<br> Uh-oh.<br> You know, uh, sometimes<br> I can keep my mouth shut.<br> Lowery, I am dying<br> of "thirst-aroonie."<br> I don't even want it in<br> the office over the weekend.<br> Put it in the safe deposit box in the<br> bank, and we'll get a cheque on Monday.<br> Yes.<br> He was flirting with you. I guess<br> he must've noticed my wedding ring.<br> Come in.<br> The copies. If you don't mind,<br> I'd like to go home after the bank.<br> - I have a slight...<br> - You go right on home.<br> Because me and your boss are goin' out<br> and get ourselves...<br> a little drinkin' done, right?<br> - Of course. Do you feel ill?<br> - Just a headache.<br> What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,<br> the playground of the world.<br> I'm going to spend this weekend<br> in bed. Thank you.<br> Aren't you going to take the pills?<br> They'll knock that headache out.<br> Can't buy off unhappiness<br> with pills.<br> I guess I'll go put this money in the<br> bank and then go home and sleep it off.<br> Marion, what in<br> the world... What are you doing up here?<br> Of course I'm glad to see you.<br> I always am.<br> What is it, Marion?<br> - Uh, hold it there.<br> In quite a hurry.<br> I didn't intend to sleep so long. I<br> almost had an accident from sleepiness.<br> - So, I decided to pull over.<br> - You slept here all night?<br> Yes. As I said,<br> I couldn't keep my eyes open.<br> There are plenty of motels<br> in this area. You should've...<br> I mean, just to be safe.<br> I didn't intend to sleep all night.<br> I just pulled over.<br> Have I broken any laws?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> - Then I'm free to go?<br> Is anything wrong?<br> Of course not. Am I acting<br> as if there's something wrong?<br> - Frankly, yes.<br> - Please, I'd like to go.<br> - Well, is there?<br> - Is there what?<br> I've told you there's nothing wrong,<br> except I'm in a hurry...<br> and you're taking up my time.<br> - Now, just a moment.<br> - Turn your motor off, please.<br> May I see your licence?<br> - Why?<br> - Please.<br> Be with you<br> in a second!<br> - I'm in no mood for trouble.<br> - What?<br> There's an old saying: "First customer<br> of the day is always the most trouble."<br> But I'm in no mood for it...<br> so I'm gonna treat you so fair<br> you won't have one reason...<br> - Can I trade my car and take another?<br> - Do anything you have a mind to.<br> Bein' a woman, you will.<br> That yours?<br> Yes, it's, it's... There's<br> nothing wrong with it. I just...<br> Sick of the sight of it.<br> Have a look around and see if there's<br> something that strikes your eyes...<br> and I'll have my mechanic<br> give yours the once-over.<br> - You want some coffee?<br> - No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...<br> and just wanna make a change.<br> One thing people never oughta be<br> when they're buyin' used cars...<br> and that's in a hurry, but like I said,<br> it's too nice a day to argue.<br> I'll shoot your car<br> in the garage here.<br> That's the one I'd have<br> picked for you myself.<br> - How much?<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Spin it around the block.<br> - It looks fine.<br> How much would it be<br> with my car?<br> You mean you don't want the usual day<br> and a half to think it over?<br> You are in a hurry, aren't you?<br> Somebody chasin' ya?<br> Of course not.<br> Please.<br> Well, it's the first time the customer<br> ever high pressured the salesman.<br> Ah, I figure roughly...<br> your car plus $700.<br> - Seven hundred.<br> - You always got time to argue money.<br> All right.<br> I take it you can prove<br> that car is yours.<br> I mean, out-of-state licence.<br> You got your pink slip...<br> I believe I have the necessary papers.<br> Is there a ladies room?<br> In the building.<br> Over there.<br> I think you better take it<br> for a trial spin.<br> I don't want any bad word of mouth<br> about California Charlie.<br> I'd really rather not.<br> Can't we just settle this...<br> I might as well be perfectly honest with<br> you. It's not that I don't trust you...<br> But what? Is there<br> anything so terribly wrong...<br> about making a decision<br> and wanting to hurry?<br> - Do you think I've stolen my car?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> All right,<br> let's go inside.<br> Hey!<br> Just put it in here, please.<br> Thank you.<br> Heck,<br> Officer, that was the first time...<br> I saw the customer<br> high pressure the salesman.<br> Somebody chasin' her?<br> I better have<br> a look at those papers, Charlie.<br> - She look like a wrong one to you?<br> - Acted like one.<br> The only funny thing,<br> she paid me $700 in cash.<br> Yes, Mr Lowery.<br> Caroline. Marion still isn't in?<br> No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always<br> a bit late on Monday mornings.<br> Buzz me the minute<br> she comes in.<br> And call her sister.<br> No one's answering at the house.<br> I called her sister where she works...<br> The Music Makers Music Store...<br> and she doesn't know where Marion<br> is any more than we do.<br> You better run out to the house. She may<br> be, well, unable to answer the phone.<br> Her sister's going to do that.<br> She's as worried as we are.<br> No, I haven't the faintest idea.<br> As I said, I last saw your sister<br> when she left this office on Friday.<br> She said she didn't feel well and wanted<br> to leave early, and I said she could.<br> That was the last I saw...<br> Oh, wait a minute.<br> I did see her<br> some time later driving...<br> Uh, I think you'd better come<br> over here to my office, quick.<br> Caroline,<br> get Mr Cassidy for me.<br> After all, Cassidy,<br> I told you, all that cash!<br> I'm not taking<br> the responsibility.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works<br> for you for ten years, you trust her.<br> All right, yes,<br> you better come over.<br> Well, I ain't<br> about to kiss off $40,000!<br> I'll get it back, and if any of it's<br> missin', I'll replace it...<br> with her fine, soft flesh!<br> - We'll track her, never you doubt it.<br> - Hold on, Cassidy.<br> I still can't believe... It must be<br> some kind of a mystery. l, I can't...<br> You checked with the bank, no?<br> They never laid eyes on her, no?<br> You still trustin'? Hot creepers!<br> She sat there while I dumped it out!<br> Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.<br> And, and even flirtin' with me!<br> Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you<br> in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.<br> - Dirty night.<br> - Do you have a vacancy?<br> Oh, we have 12 vacancies.<br> They, uh... They moved<br> away the highway.<br> Oh, I thought I'd gotten<br> off the main road.<br> I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops<br> here any more unless they've done that.<br> But... there's no sense<br> dwelling on our losses.<br> We just keep on lighting the lights<br> and following the formalities.<br> Your home address.<br> Oh, just the town will do.<br> Los Angeles.<br> Cabin one. It's closer in case you want<br> anything. It's right next to the office.<br> I want sleep more than anything else,<br> except maybe food.<br> There's a big diner about ten miles<br> up the road, just outside of Fairvale.<br> - Am I that close to Fairvale?<br> - Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.<br> Boy, it's stuffy in here.<br> Well, the, uh, mattress<br> is soft and...<br> there's hangers in the closet<br> and stationary...<br> with "Bates Motel"<br> printed on it...<br> in case you wanna make your<br> friends back home feel envious.<br> And the, uh...<br> - Over there.<br> - The bathroom.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,<br> just... just tap on the wall.<br> - I'll be in the office.<br> - Thank you, Mr Bates.<br> Norman Bates.<br> You're not really gonna go out again<br> and drive up to the diner, are you?<br> - No.<br> - Then would you do me a favour?<br> Would you have dinner with me?<br> I was just about to myself. Nothing<br> special... just sandwiches and milk.<br> But I'd like it very much<br> if you'd come up to the house.<br> I don't set a fancy table,<br> but the kitchen's awful homey.<br> - I'd like to.<br> - All right.<br> You get yourself settled and,<br> and take off your wet shoes.<br> - I'll be back as soon as it's ready.<br> - Okay.<br> - With my... With my trusty umbrella.<br> No! I tell you no!<br> I won't have you bringing strange<br> young girls in for supper!<br> By candlelight, I suppose,<br> in the cheap, erotic fashion...<br> - of young men with cheap, erotic minds!<br> - Mother, please.<br> And then what, after supper?<br> Music? Whispers?<br> Mother, she's just a stranger.<br> She's hungry and it's raining out.<br> "Mother, she's just a stranger." As if<br> men don't desire strangers. As if...<br> Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting<br> things, because they disgust me!<br> Do you understand, boy?<br> Go on.<br> Go tell her she'll not be<br> appeasing her ugly appetite...<br> with my food or my son!<br> Or do I have to tell her<br> 'cause you don't have the guts?<br> - Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?<br> - Shut up! Shut up!<br> - I've caused you some trouble.<br> - No, uh...<br> Mother...<br> My mother, uh...<br> What is the phrase?<br> She isn't quite<br> herself today.<br> You shouldn't have bothered. I really<br> don't have that much of an appetite.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I wish you could apologize<br> for other people.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> But as long as you've fixed<br> the supper, we may as well eat it.<br> It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer<br> and warmer in the office.<br> Well, it stopped<br> raining.<br> Uh, eating in an office<br> is just... just too officious.<br> - I have the parlour back here.<br> - All right.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> You're very kind.<br> It's all for you.<br> I'm not hungry. Go ahead.<br> You... You eat like a bird.<br> And you'd know,<br> of course.<br> No, not really.<br> Anyway, I hear the expression<br> "Eats like a bird"...<br> is really a fal...<br> false... falsity.<br> Because birds really<br> eat a tremendous lot.<br> But I really don't know anything about<br> birds. My hobby is stuffing things.<br> You know, taxidermy.<br> And I guess I'd just rather<br> stuff birds because...<br> I hate the look of beasts<br> when they're stuffed.<br> You know,<br> foxes and chimps.<br> Some people even stuff dogs and cats,<br> but, oh, I can't do that.<br> I think only birds<br> look well stuffed because...<br> Well, because they're kind<br> of passive to begin with.<br> It's a strange hobby.<br> Curious.<br> - Uncommon too.<br> - Oh, I imagine so.<br> And it's... it's not as expensive<br> as you'd think. It's cheap, really.<br> You know, needles<br> and thread, sawdust.<br> The chemicals are the only<br> thing that, that cost anything.<br> A man should have a hobby.<br> Well, it's...<br> it's more than a hobby.<br> A hobby's supposed to<br> pass the time, not fill it.<br> Is your time so empty?<br> No. Uh...<br> Well, I run the office...<br> and tend the cabins<br> and grounds...<br> and do little, uh,<br> errands for my mother...<br> the ones she allows<br> I might be capable of doing.<br> Do you go out with friends?<br> Well, a boy's best friend<br> is his mother.<br> You've never had an empty moment<br> in your entire life, have you?<br> - Only my share.<br> - Where are you going?<br> I didn't mean to pry.<br> I'm looking for<br> a private island.<br> What are you<br> running away from?<br> - Why do you ask that?<br> - No.<br> People never run away<br> from anything.<br> The rain didn't last long,<br> did it? You know what I think?<br> I think that...<br> we're all in<br> our private traps...<br> clamped in them, and none of us<br> can ever get out.<br> We scratch and...<br> and claw...<br> but only at the air,<br> only at each other.<br> And for all of it,<br> we never budge an inch.<br> Sometimes we deliberately<br> step into those traps.<br> I was born in mine.<br> I don't mind it any more.<br> Oh, but you should.<br> You should mind it.<br> Oh, I do, but I say I don't.<br> You know, if anyone ever talked<br> to me the way I heard...<br> the way she spoke to you...<br> Sometimes when she talks<br> to me like that...<br> I feel I'd like to go up there and<br> curse her and, and leave her forever.<br> Or at least defy her.<br> But I know I can't.<br> She's ill.<br> She sounded strong.<br> No, I mean... ill.<br> She had to raise me all by herself,<br> after my father died.<br> I was only five and it,<br> it must've been quite a strain for her.<br> I mean, she didn't have to go to work or<br> anything. He left her a little money.<br> Anyway, a few years ago,<br> Mother met this man.<br> And he... he talked her<br> into building this motel.<br> He could have talked her<br> into anything.<br> And when he died too, it was<br> just too great a shock for her.<br> And the way<br> he died...<br> I guess it's nothing<br> to talk about while you're eating.<br> Anyway, it was just too great<br> a loss for her. She had nothing left.<br> Except you.<br> Well, a son is a poor substitute<br> for a lover.<br> Why don't you go away?<br> To a private island,<br> like you?<br> No... not like me.<br> I couldn't do that.<br> Who'd look after her?<br> She'd be alone up there.<br> The fire would go out.<br> It'd be cold and damp<br> like a grave.<br> If you love someone, you don't do that<br> to them, even if you hate them.<br> You understand, l...<br> I don't hate her.<br> I hate what she's become.<br> I hate the illness.<br> Wouldn't it be better<br> if you put her... some place?<br> You mean an institution?<br> A madhouse?<br> People always call<br> a madhouse "some place," don't they?<br> Put her in "some place."<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean it<br> to sound uncaring.<br> What do you know<br> about caring?<br> Have you ever seen the inside<br> of one of those places?<br> The laughing and the tears...<br> and the cruel eyes<br> studying you.<br> My mother there?<br> But she's harmless.<br> She's as harmless as one<br> of those stuffed birds.<br> I am sorry.<br> I only felt...<br> It seems she's hurting you.<br> - I meant well.<br> - People always mean well.<br> They cluck their thick tongues<br> and shake their heads and suggest...<br> oh, so very delicately...<br> Of course,<br> I've suggested it myself.<br> But I hate to even think about it.<br> She needs me.<br> It... It's not as if she were<br> a... a maniac, a raving thing.<br> She...<br> She just goes<br> a little mad sometimes.<br> We all go a little mad<br> sometimes.<br> Haven't you?<br> Yes.<br> Sometimes just one time<br> can be enough. Thank you.<br> Thank you, "Norman."<br> Norman.<br> Oh, you're not... you're not<br> going back to your room already?<br> I'm very tired.<br> And I have a long drive tomorrow,<br> all the way back to Phoenix.<br> Really?<br> I stepped into a private trap<br> back there...<br> and I'd like to go back and try<br> to pull myself out of it...<br> bef ore it's too late<br> for me too.<br> Are you sure you wouldn't like<br> to stay a little while longer?<br> - I mean, just for talk.<br> - Oh, I'd like to, but...<br> All right. Well,<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> I'll bring you some breakfast,<br> all right?<br> - What time?<br> - Very early. Dawn.<br> All right, Miss, uh...<br> - Crane.<br> - Crane. That's it.<br> Good night.<br> Ow! No!<br> No! Aaah!<br> Mother! Oh, God, Mother!<br> Blood! Blood!<br> I've tried many brands.<br> So far, of those I've used, I haven't<br> had much luck with any of them.<br> Let's see what they say<br> about this one.<br> They tell you<br> what its ingredients are...<br> and how it's guaranteed to exterminate<br> every insect in the world...<br> but they do not tell you<br> whether it's painless.<br> And I say, insect or man,<br> death should always be painless.<br> This one seems to claim more and better<br> qualities than lots of the others.<br> Sam?<br> Sam!<br> Lady wants to see ya.<br> - Yes, miss?<br> - I'm Marion's sister.<br> - Oh, sure. Lila.<br> - Is Marion here?<br> - Well, of course not. Something wrong?<br> - Thank you.<br> - She left home on Friday.<br> I was in Tucson over the weekend<br> and I haven't heard from her since.<br> Not even<br> a phone call.<br> If you two are in this together,<br> it's none of my business...<br> but I want Marion to tell me it's none<br> of my business and then I'll go...<br> Bob, run out and get yourself<br> some lunch, will ya?<br> - That's okay. I brought it with me.<br> - Run out and eat it.<br> Now, what thing<br> could we be in together?<br> Sorry about the tears.<br> Well, is Marion in trouble?<br> What is it?<br> Let's all talk about<br> Marion, shall we?<br> Who are you,<br> friend?<br> My name is Arbogast,<br> friend.<br> I'm a private<br> investigator.<br> - Where is she, Miss Crane?<br> - I don't know you.<br> I know you don't, because if you did<br> I wouldn't be able to follow you.<br> What's your interest<br> in this?<br> Well, $40,000.<br> - $40,000?<br> - That's right.<br> One of you'd better tell me what's going<br> on, and fast. I can take so much...<br> Now, take it easy,<br> friend.<br> It's just that your girlfriend<br> stole $40,000.<br> What are you talking about?<br> What is this?<br> She was supposed to bank it on Friday<br> for her boss, and she didn't.<br> - No one has seen her since.<br> - Someone has seen her.<br> Someone always sees a girl<br> with $40,000.<br> They don't want to prosecute,<br> they just want the money back.<br> - Sam, if she's here...<br> - She isn't. She isn't.<br> Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come<br> up here on a hunch and nothing more?<br> Oh, not even a hunch.<br> Just hope.<br> Well, with a little checking<br> I could get to believe you.<br> I don't care<br> if you believe me or not.<br> All I want to do is see Marion<br> bef ore she gets in this too deeply.<br> Did you check Phoenix?<br> Maybe she had an accident, or a hold-up.<br> No, she was seen leaving town in her<br> own car... by her employer, I might add.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Can you?<br> We're always quickest<br> to doubt people...<br> who have a reputation<br> for being honest.<br> I think she's here,<br> Miss Crane.<br> Where there's<br> a boyfriend...<br> She's not back there with the nuts and<br> bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.<br> I'll find her.<br> I'll be seeing you.<br> - Evening.<br> - Evening.<br> I almost drove<br> right past.<br> I'm always forgetting to turn<br> the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.<br> Twelve, in fact.<br> Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.<br> - Candy?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Last two days I've been to so many<br> motels my eyes are bleary with neon...<br> but this is the first place that looks<br> like it's hiding from the world.<br> To tell the truth, I didn't<br> really forget to turn the sign on.<br> - Just doesn't seem like<br> any use any more.<br> - Oh?<br> See, that used to be<br> the main highway right there.<br> - Wanna register?<br> - Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.<br> - I just wanna ask a few questions.<br> - No trouble. Today's linen day.<br> I always change the beds once a week<br> whether they've been used or not.<br> Hate the smell of dampness. It's such<br> a, I don't know... creepy smell.<br> You out to buy<br> a motel?<br> No.<br> Reason I ask, you said you'd seen<br> so many the past couple of days...<br> I thought maybe...<br> What, uh... What was it<br> you wanted to ask?<br> I'm looking for<br> a missing person.<br> My name's Arbogast.<br> I'm a private investigator.<br> I've been trying<br> to trace a girl...<br> that's been missing for,<br> oh, about a week now from Phoenix.<br> It's a private matter.<br> The family wants to forgive her.<br> She's not<br> in any trouble.<br> I didn't think the police went looking<br> for people who aren't in trouble.<br> - I'm not the police.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> We have reason to believe she came<br> along this way. Did she stop here?<br> No one's stopped here<br> for a couple of weeks.<br> Mind looking at the picture<br> bef ore committing yourself?<br> Commit myself?<br> - You sure talk like a policeman.<br> - Look at the picture, please.<br> - Mm-mmm. Yeah.<br> - Sure?<br> Well, she may have<br> used an alias.<br> Marion Crane's<br> her real name...<br> but she could've registered<br> under a different one.<br> I tell ya, I don't even much bother<br> with guests registering any more.<br> One by one,<br> you drop the formalities.<br> I shouldn't even bother changing<br> the sheets, but old habits die hard.<br> Which reminds me...<br> - What's that?<br> - The sign.<br> A couple last week said<br> if the thing hadn't been on...<br> they would've thought<br> this was an old, deserted...<br> You see,<br> that's exactly my point.<br> Nobody'd been here<br> for a couple weeks...<br> and there's a couple came by<br> and didn't know that you were open.<br> As you say,<br> old habits die hard.<br> This girl could've registered<br> under another name. Mind if I look?<br> - No.<br> - Thank you.<br> All right.<br> I'll get the date<br> somewhere. Mm-hmm.<br> See, there's nobody.<br> Let's see, I have a sample<br> of her handwriting here.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Here we are.<br> - Marie Samuels.<br> - Hmm.<br> That's an interesting<br> alias.<br> - Is that her?<br> - Yeah, I think so.<br> Marie, Marion.<br> - Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Mm-hmm. Was she<br> in disguise, by any chance?<br> - Wanna check the picture again?<br> - I wasn't lying to you.<br> Oh, I know that.<br> I know you wouldn't lie.<br> It's tough keeping track<br> of the time around here.<br> I know.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Well, i-i-it was raining<br> and, um, her hair was all wet.<br> I tell ya, it's not really<br> a very good picture of her.<br> No, I guess not.<br> Tell me all about her.<br> Well, um...<br> she arrived, um, rather late<br> one night, went straight to sleep...<br> and, uh, left early<br> the next morning.<br> - How early?<br> - Oh, ex... very early.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Which morning was that?<br> Uh, the, um...<br> Th-Th-Th-The next morning.<br> - Sunday.<br> - I see. Mm-hmm.<br> - Did anyone meet her here?<br> - No.<br> - Did she arrive with anyone?<br> - No.<br> - Did she make any phone calls or...<br> - No.<br> - Locally?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> - Did you spend the night with her?<br> - No.<br> Then how would you know<br> she didn't make any calls?<br> Uh, w-w...<br> Well, she was very tired<br> a-and, uh...<br> See, l... N-Now I'm starting<br> to, um... remember.<br> l-I'm making a mental picture<br> of it in my mind.<br> - If you make a mental picturization...<br> - Right. Take your time.<br> Um, she was...<br> she was sitting back there...<br> N-No, she was standing back there<br> with a sandwich in her hand.<br> She said she had to<br> go to sleep early...<br> because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,<br> uh, ahead of her.<br> - Mm-hmm. Back where?<br> - Back where she came from.<br> No, you said bef ore she<br> was standing back there...<br> Yes, b-back in my parlour.<br> She was very hungry,<br> I made her a sandwich...<br> and then she said she was tired and<br> she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.<br> I see.<br> How did she pay you?<br> - Cash? Cheque?<br> - Cash.<br> Cash, huh?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> - After she left, she didn't come back?<br> - Uh-uh. Why should she?<br> Hmm.<br> Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,<br> I guess that's about it.<br> l-I've got some work to do,<br> if you don't mind.<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I do mind.<br> See, if it doesn't jell,<br> it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.<br> It's not coming together.<br> Something's missing.<br> Well, l-l-I don't know<br> what you c-could expect me to know.<br> People just come and go,<br> you know.<br> That's right.<br> She isn't still here, is she?<br> No.<br> If I wanted to check the cabins, all<br> twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?<br> If you don't believe me, come on<br> with me. You can help me change beds.<br> Oh.<br> No, thanks.<br> Uh, change your mind?<br> Oh.<br> You know, l... I think I have one of<br> those faces you can't help believing.<br> - Is anyone at home?<br> - No.<br> Oh? There's somebody<br> sitting in the window.<br> - N-N-No, there isn't.<br> - Sure. Take a look.<br> Oh, th-that must be<br> my mother.<br> She's an, uh, "inavlid..."<br> an invalid.<br> Uh, it's practically<br> like living alone.<br> Oh, I see.<br> If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,<br> you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?<br> - No.<br> - Not even if she paid you well?<br> No.<br> Let's say, for the sake of argument,<br> she wanted you to gallantly protect her.<br> You'd know<br> you were being used.<br> - You wouldn't be made a fool of.<br> - I'm not a fool.<br> And I'm not capable of being fooled,<br> not even by a woman.<br> - This is not a slur on your manhood.<br> - Let's put it this way.<br> She might have fooled me,<br> but she didn't fool my mother.<br> Then your mother met her.<br> Could I talk to your mother?<br> No. As I told you,<br> she's confined.<br> Just for a few minutes. There might be<br> some hint that you missed out on.<br> Sick old women<br> are usually pretty sharp.<br> - I wouldn't disturb her.<br> - Mr Arbogast, l-I think I've...<br> - I think I've talked to you all I want.<br> - Yes, but just for...<br> It'd be much better<br> if you left now. Thanks.<br> Well, all right.<br> You sure would save me a lot of<br> leg work if you'd let me talk to her.<br> - Would I need a warrant for that too?<br> - Sure.<br> All right.<br> Thanks, anyway.<br> Hello, Loomis.<br> This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?<br> Let me talk to her,<br> please.<br> Hello, Lila.<br> Lila, listen.<br> Marion was up here.<br> Yes, she spent last Saturday night<br> at the Bates Motel.<br> It's out<br> on the old highway.<br> I even know what cabin she was in...<br> it was number one.<br> Well, this young fella that runs the<br> place said she just spent the night...<br> left the next day<br> and that was it.<br> Mmm.<br> Um, no, not exactly.<br> Well, I did question him,<br> believe me...<br> but I think I got<br> all there was to get.<br> I'll just have to pick up<br> the pieces from here.<br> Well, I tell ya,<br> I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...<br> See, this boy<br> had a sick old mother.<br> I think she saw Marion<br> and talked to her.<br> No. No, unf ortunately,<br> he wouldn't let me see her.<br> Well, I was, but I think I'll go<br> back to the motel first.<br> No, you stay there with Loomis.<br> I'll be back in about an hour.<br> All right, fine.<br> Listen, l...<br> You'll be happy to know<br> what I think.<br> Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis<br> didn't know that Marion was here.<br> All right. See ya<br> in about an hour... or less.<br> All right, bye-bye.<br> Bates?<br> Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely<br> sound. Ever notice that, Lila?<br> Sam, he said<br> an hour or less.<br> Yeah.<br> It's been three.<br> Are we just<br> going to sit here and wait?<br> He'll be back.<br> Let's sit still<br> and hang on, okay?<br> - How far is the old highway?<br> - You wanna go out there, don't you?<br> - Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.<br> - Yes.<br> - Maybe shake her up.<br> - Yes!<br> - That wouldn't be wise.<br> - Patience doesn't run in my family.<br> - I'm going out there.<br> - Arbogast said...<br> An hour, or less.<br> - Well, I'm going.<br> You'll never find it.<br> - Stay here.<br> - Why can't I go?<br> I don't know. One of us has to be here,<br> in case he's on the way.<br> What am I supposed to do,<br> just sit here and wait?<br> Yeah. Stay here.<br> Arbogast?<br> Arbogast!<br> Arbogast!<br> - He didn't come back here?<br> - Sam!<br> No Arbogast, no Bates.<br> Only the old lady at home.<br> Sick old lady unable to answer<br> the door... or unwilling.<br> Where could he<br> have gone?<br> Maybe he got<br> some definite lead.<br> - Maybe he went right on.<br> - Without calling me?<br> - In a hurry.<br> - Sam, he called...<br> when he had nothing<br> but a dissatisfied feeling.<br> Don't you think he'd have called<br> if he had anything at all?<br> Yes, I think<br> he would've.<br> - Let's go see Al Chambers.<br> - Who's he?<br> - Our deputy sheriff around here.<br> - Let me get my coat.<br> Good evening.<br> Well, l... I don't know where to start,<br> except at the beginning.<br> Yes.<br> - This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.<br> - How do you do?<br> She's been here<br> searching for her sister.<br> There's this<br> private detective helping.<br> We got a call from this<br> detective... he'd traced her...<br> to that motel<br> on the old highway.<br> That must be<br> the Bates Motel.<br> He called to say he was going<br> to question Mrs Bates.<br> Norman took a wife?<br> No, l-I don't think so.<br> An old woman. His mother.<br> That was early this evening. We<br> haven't seen or heard from him since.<br> Now, your sister's<br> missing how long?<br> She left Phoenix a week ago<br> yesterday without a trace.<br> How'd you and this detective come<br> to trace her to Fairvale?<br> They thought<br> she'd be coming to me.<br> - Left Phoenix under her own steam?<br> - Yes.<br> She's not missing so much<br> as she's run away.<br> That's right.<br> From what?<br> She stole some money.<br> A lot?<br> Forty thousand dollars.<br> The police haven't<br> been able to...<br> Everyone concerned thought if they<br> could get her to give the money back...<br> they could avoid involving her<br> with the police.<br> That explains<br> the private detective.<br> He traced her<br> to the Bates place.<br> What exactly did he say<br> when he called you?<br> He said Marion was there<br> for one night, then she left.<br> - With the $40,000?<br> - He didn't say anything...<br> about the money.<br> It isn't important<br> what he said, is it?<br> He was supposed to come talk to us after<br> he talked to the mother, and he didn't.<br> That's what I want you<br> to do something about.<br> Like what?<br> I'm sorry if<br> I seem overanxious.<br> I'm sure there's something wrong<br> out there, and I have to know what.<br> Well, I think there's something wrong<br> too, Miss, but not the same thing.<br> I think what's wrong<br> is your private detective.<br> I think he got himself a hot lead<br> as to where your sister was goin'...<br> probably from Norman Bates...<br> and called you to keep you still while<br> he took off after her and the money.<br> No, no, he said he was dissatisfied<br> and he was going back there.<br> Call Norman and let him<br> say what happened.<br> At this hour?<br> He was out when I was there a while ago.<br> If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.<br> He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin'<br> the door in the dead of night<br> like some people do.<br> This fellow lives<br> like a hermit.<br> You must remember that bad business<br> out there about ten years ago.<br> Please. Call.<br> Florrie, the sheriff wants you<br> to connect him with the Bates Motel.<br> Norman?<br> Sheriff Chambers.<br> Ye... I been<br> just fine, thanks.<br> Listen, we got<br> worries here.<br> Yeah, have you had a fella<br> stop by there tonight...<br> Well, this one<br> wouldn't be a customer.<br> - A private detective, name of...<br> - Arbogast.<br> Arbogast.<br> And after he left?<br> No, that's...<br> that's okay, Norman.<br> This detective was there,<br> Norman told him about the girl...<br> the detective thanked him<br> and he went away.<br> And he didn't come back?<br> He didn't see the mother?<br> Your detective told you<br> he couldn't come right back...<br> because he was going to question<br> Norman Bates' mother, right?<br> Yes.<br> Norman Bates' mother<br> has been dead and buried...<br> in Greenlawn Cemetery<br> for the past ten years.<br> I helped Norman pick out the dress<br> she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.<br> 'Tain't only<br> local history, Sam.<br> It's the only case of murder<br> and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.<br> Mrs Bates poisoned this guy<br> she was... involved with...<br> when she found out<br> he was married...<br> then took a helpin' of<br> the same stuff herself.<br> Strychnine.<br> Ugly way to die.<br> Norman found them<br> dead together.<br> In bed.<br> You mean that old woman I saw sittin'<br> in the window wasn't Bates' mother?<br> Now, wait a minute, Sam.<br> Are you sure you saw an old woman?<br> Yes! In the house<br> behind the motel!<br> I called and pounded<br> but she just ignored me!<br> You saw<br> Norman Bates' mother?<br> But it had to be...<br> because Arbogast said so too!<br> And the young man wouldn't let him<br> see her because she was too ill.<br> Well, if the woman up there<br> is Mrs Bates...<br> who's that woman buried<br> out in Greenlawn Cemetery?<br> Now, Mother, um...<br> l-I'm gonna bring something up...<br> I am sorry, boy...<br> but you do manage to look ludicrous<br> when you give me orders.<br> Please, Mother.<br> No!<br> I will not hide in the fruit cellar.<br> Ha! You think<br> I'm fruity, huh?<br> I'm staying right here.<br> This is my room and<br> no one will drag me out of it...<br> least of all<br> my big, bold son.<br> They'll come now, Mother.<br> He came after the girl,<br> and now someone will come after him.<br> Mother, please, it's just for<br> a few days so they won't find you.<br> Just for a few days?<br> In that dark, dank<br> fruit cellar? No!<br> You hid me there once, boy, and you<br> won't do it again, not ever again!<br> Now get out!<br> - I told you to get out, boy.<br> - I'll carry you, Mother.<br> Norman, what do you<br> think you're doing?<br> Don't you touch me!<br> Don't! Norman!<br> Put me down! Put me down!<br> I can walk on my own.<br> Wonderful sermon today.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> We thought we'd drive out<br> to that motel with you.<br> - He's already been.<br> - Went out bef ore service.<br> - Did you two have breakfast?<br> - Didn't find anything?<br> Nothing. Let's<br> clear the way here.<br> What did he say<br> about my sister?<br> Just what he told your detective:<br> She used a fake name.<br> Saw the register myself. Saw the<br> whole place. That boy's alone there.<br> - No mother?<br> - You must have seen an illusion, Sam.<br> I know you're not<br> the seein'-illusions type...<br> but no woman was there and I don't<br> believe in ghosts, so there it is.<br> I still feel<br> there's something...<br> Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't<br> make you feel better.<br> Come to my office this afternoon and<br> report a missing person and a theft.<br> The sooner you drop this<br> in the lap of the law...<br> that's the sooner you stand a chance<br> of your sister bein' picked up.<br> How 'bout that?<br> - I don't know.<br> - It's Sunday.<br> Come to the house and do your reporting<br> around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.<br> You too, Sam.<br> Thank you.<br> - Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.<br> - No, you're not.<br> - You want me to drop you at the hotel...<br> - Sam.<br> I still won't feel satisfied<br> until I go out there.<br> Neither will I.<br> Come on.<br> We better decide what we're gonna say<br> or do when we walk in there.<br> We're going to register<br> as man and wife.<br> We're going to<br> get shown to a cabin...<br> and then we're going to search every<br> inch of the place, inside and out.<br> I wonder where Norman Bates<br> does his hermiting.<br> Someone's at that window.<br> I just saw the curtain move.<br> Come on.<br> - Well?<br> - Just coming up to ring for you.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Suppose you want a room.<br> We were gonna try to make it<br> to San Francisco...<br> but we don't like the look<br> of that sky.<br> Looks like a bad day coming,<br> doesn't it?<br> - I'll take you to cabin ten.<br> - Better sign in first, hadn't we?<br> That's not necessary.<br> My boss is paying for this trip<br> and, uh, well, it's 90%business.<br> He wants practically<br> notarized receipts.<br> I'd better sign in<br> and get a receipt.<br> Thank you.<br> - I'll get your bags.<br> - Haven't any.<br> - I'll show you the room, then.<br> - First time I've ever seen it happen.<br> You check in any other place<br> in this country without bags...<br> - and you have to pay in advance.<br> - Ten dollars.<br> That receipt.<br> I'll go on ahead.<br> All right, there's<br> your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.<br> Don't bother yourself.<br> We'll find it.<br> Sam, we have to go into that cabin<br> and search it...<br> no matter what we're afraid of<br> finding or how much it may hurt.<br> I know.<br> Do you think if something<br> happened, it happened there?<br> I don't know, but if you had...<br> a useless business like this motel,<br> what would you need to get out?<br> To get a new business somewhere else?<br> Forty thousand dollars?<br> How could we prove that...<br> If he opens a motel on<br> the new highway in, say, a year...<br> There must be some proof<br> that exists now...<br> something that proves he got<br> that money away from Marion somehow.<br> - What makes you sound so certain?<br> - Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.<br> Or he felt sorry for me<br> and he was beginning to feel...<br> the same way about you.<br> I could tell the last time<br> I talked to him on the phone.<br> He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done<br> anything without telling us...<br> unless he was stopped.<br> And he was stopped. So he must<br> have found out something.<br> We'll start with cabin one.<br> If he sees us,<br> we're just taking the air.<br> Bates.<br> No shower curtain.<br> - Sam! Look!<br> - Huh? What is it?<br> It's figuring. It didn't<br> get washed down. Look.<br> Some figure has been added to<br> or subtracted from 40,000.<br> That proves Marion was here.<br> It'd be too wild a coincidence...<br> Bates never denied she was here.<br> Oh. Doesn't that prove<br> he found out about the money?<br> Do we simply ask him<br> where he's hidden it?<br> But that old woman, whoever she is,<br> she told Arbogast something.<br> I want her to tell us<br> the same thing.<br> - You can't go up there.<br> - Why not?<br> - Bates.<br> - Well, let's find him.<br> One of us can keep him occupied while<br> the other gets to the old woman.<br> You'll never be able to hold him<br> still if he doesn't want to be held.<br> I don't like you going<br> into that house alone.<br> I can handle a sick old woman.<br> All right, I'll find Bates<br> and keep him occupied.<br> Wait a minute.<br> If you get anything<br> out of the mother...<br> can you find your way<br> back to town?<br> Yes, of course.<br> If you do get anything,<br> don't stop to tell me.<br> - You looking for me?<br> - Why, yes, as a matter of fact.<br> Wife's taking a nap and...<br> I never can keep quiet enough for her,<br> so I thought I'd look you up and talk.<br> - Good. You satisfied with your cabin?<br> - Oh, it's fine.<br> I've been doing all the talking<br> so far, haven't I?<br> I thought it was the people<br> who were alone most of the time...<br> who did all the talking<br> when they got the chance.<br> Here you are<br> doing all the listening.<br> - You are alone here, aren't you?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Drive me crazy.<br> I think that would be a rather<br> extreme reaction, don't you?<br> Just an expression. What I meant was,<br> uh, I'd do anything to get away.<br> - Wouldn't you?<br> - No.<br> - Mrs Bates?<br> I'm not saying you<br> shouldn't be contented here...<br> I'm just doubting that you are.<br> I think if you saw a chance to get out<br> from under you'd unload this place.<br> This place? This place happens<br> to be my only world.<br> I grew up in that house.<br> I had a very happy childhood.<br> My mother and I<br> were more than happy.<br> You look frightened. Have I been<br> saying something frightening?<br> I don't know<br> what you've been saying.<br> I've been talking about your mother,<br> about your motel.<br> - How you gonna do it?<br> - Do what?<br> Buy a new one in a new town where you<br> won't have to hide your mother.<br> Why don't you just get in<br> your car and drive away?<br> Where will you get the money to do that?<br> Or do you already have it socked away?<br> - Shut up!<br> - A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.<br> I bet your mother knows where the money<br> is and what you did to get it.<br> I think<br> she'll tell us.<br> Where's that girl you came here with?<br> Where is she?<br> Mrs Bates, it's...<br> Norman Bates!<br> If anyone gets any answers<br> it'll be the psychiatrist.<br> Even I couldn't get to Norman<br> and he knows me.<br> - You warm enough, miss?<br> - Yes.<br> Did he talk<br> to you?<br> No.<br> I got the whole story, but not from<br> Norman. I got it from his "mother."<br> Norman Bates<br> no longer exists.<br> He only half-existed<br> to begin with.<br> And now the other half<br> has taken over...<br> probably for all time.<br> Did he kill my sister?<br> Yes... and no.<br> Now look, if you're trying to lay<br> some psychiatric groundwork...<br> for some sort of plea<br> this fellow would like to cop...<br> A psychiatrist<br> doesn't lay the groundwork.<br> He merely tries<br> to explain it.<br> - But my sister is...<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, I'm sorry.<br> The private investigator too.<br> If you drag that swamp somewhere in<br> the vicinity of the motel, you'll...<br> Uh, have you any unsolved<br> missing persons cases on your books?<br> - Yes, two.<br> - Young girls?<br> - Did he confess to...<br> - Like I said...<br> the "mother."<br> To understand it the way I understood<br> it, hearing it from the "mother"...<br> that is from the "mother" half<br> of Norman's mind...<br> you have to go back<br> ten years...<br> to the time when Norman murdered<br> his mother and her lover.<br> He was already dangerously disturbed,<br> had been since his father died.<br> His mother was<br> a clinging, demanding woman...<br> and for years the two of them lived as<br> if there was no one else in the world.<br> Then she met a man...<br> and it seemed to Norman that<br> she threw him over for this man.<br> That pushed him over the line<br> and he killed them both.<br> Matricide is probably the most<br> unbearable crime of all...<br> most unbearable<br> to the son who commits it.<br> So he had to erase the crime,<br> at least in his own mind.<br> He stole her corpse.<br> A weighted coffin<br> was buried.<br> He hid the body<br> in the fruit cellar...<br> even treated it to keep it<br> as well as it would keep.<br> And that still<br> wasn't enough.<br> She was there...<br> but she was a corpse.<br> So he began to think<br> and speak for her...<br> give her half his life,<br> so to speak.<br> At times he could be both personalities,<br> carry on conversations.<br> At other times, the "mother" half<br> took over completely.<br> He was never all Norman,<br> but he was often only "Mother"...<br> and because he was so<br> pathologically jealous of her...<br> he assumed that she<br> was as jealous of him.<br> Theref ore, if he felt a strong<br> attraction to any other woman...<br> the "mother" side of him<br> would go wild.<br> When he met your sister...<br> he was touched by her,<br> aroused by her.<br> He wanted her.<br> That set off the jealous "mother"<br> and "Mother" killed the girl.<br> After the murder Norman returned<br> as if from a deep sleep...<br> and, like a dutiful son, covered up<br> all traces of the crime...<br> he was convinced<br> his "mother" had committed!<br> Why was he...<br> dressed like that?<br> He's a transvestite.<br> Uh, not exactly.<br> A man who dresses in women's clothing<br> in order to achieve a sexual change...<br> or satisf action,<br> is a transvestite.<br> But in Norman's case, he was simply<br> doing everything possible...<br> to keep alive the illusion<br> of his mother being alive.<br> And when reality<br> came to close...<br> when danger or desire<br> threatened that illusion...<br> he dressed up, even to<br> a cheap wig he bought.<br> He'd walk about the house,<br> sit in her chair, speak in her voice.<br> He tried to be<br> his mother.<br> And, uh, now he is.<br> That's what I meant when I said<br> I got the story from the "mother."<br> You see, when the mind<br> houses two personalities...<br> there's always<br> a conflict, a battle.<br> In Norman's case,<br> the battle is over...<br> and the dominant personality<br> has won.<br> And the $40,000?<br> Who got that?<br> The swamp. These were<br> crimes of passion, not profit.<br> He feels a little chill.<br> Can I bring him this blanket?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> - All right.<br> Thank you.<br> It's sad when<br> a mother has to speak the words...<br> that condemn her own son...<br> but I couldn't allow them<br> to believe that I would commit murder.<br> They'll put him away now,<br> as I should have years ago.<br> He was always bad,<br> and in the end...<br> he intended to tell them I killed<br> those girls and that man...<br> as if I could do anything<br> except sit and stare...<br> like one<br> of his stuffed birds.<br> They know I can't even<br> move a finger, and I won't.<br> I'll just sit here and be quiet,<br> just in case they do suspect me.<br> They're probably watching me.<br> Well, let them.<br> Let them see<br> what kind of a person I am.<br> I'm not even<br> gonna swat that fly.<br> I hope they are watching.<br> They'll see.<br> They'll see<br> and they'll know...<br> and they'll say, "Why, she<br> wouldn't even harm a fly."<br>
