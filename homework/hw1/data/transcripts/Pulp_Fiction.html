                        Forget it. It's too risky.<br> I'm through doing that shit.<br> You always say that.<br> The same thing every time.<br> "I'm through, never again,<br> too dangerous."<br> I know that's what I always say.<br> I'm always right too.<br> - You forget about it in a day or two.<br> - The days of me forgetting are over.<br> The days of me remembering<br> have just begun.<br> You know, when you go on like this,<br> what you sound like?<br> - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br> - You sound like a duck.<br> - Quack, quack, quack.<br> - Take heart, 'cause you're never<br> gonna have to hear it again.<br> Since I'm never gonna<br> do it again, you're never<br> gonna have to hear me quack.<br> - After tonight?<br> - Correct. I got all tonight to quack.<br> - Can I get anyone more coffee?<br> - Oh, yes!<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> I mean, the way it is now,<br> you're takin' the same risk<br> as when you rob a bank.<br> Takin' more of a risk.<br> Banks are easier.<br> Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br> in any way during a robbery.<br> They're insured. Why should<br> they give a fuck? I don't even<br> need a gun in a Federal bank.<br> Heard about this one bloke, he walks<br> into a bank with a portable phone.<br> He gives the phone to a teller.<br> The bloke on the other end says,<br> "We got this guy's little girl.<br> If you don't give him all your<br> money, we're gonna kill her."<br> - Did it work?<br> - Fuckin' right it worked.<br> That's what I'm talkin' about.<br> Knucklehead walks into a bank<br> with a telephone. Not a pistol,<br> not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.<br> - Cleans the place out.<br> They don't lift a fuckin' finger.<br> - Did they hurt the little girl?<br> There probably never was<br> a little girl. The point of<br> the story isn't a little girl.<br> The point of the story is they<br> robbed a bank with a telephone.<br> - You want to rob banks?<br> - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.<br> I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be<br> easier than what we've been doing.<br> -No more liquor stores?<br> -What've we been talkin' about?<br> Yeah, no more liquor stores.<br> Besides, it ain't the giggle<br> it used to be. There's too many<br> foreigners own liquor stores.<br> Vietnamese, Koreans,<br> don't even speak fuckin' English.<br> You tell'em empty out<br> the register, they don't know<br> what you're talkin' about.<br> They make it too personal.<br> - We keep on, one of these gook<br> fuckers gonna make us kill him.<br> - I'm not gonna kill anybody.<br> I don't want to either.<br> But they'll probably put us<br> in a situation where it's us or them.<br> And if it's not the gooks,<br> it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br> the store for 15 fucking generations.<br> You got Grandpa Irving sitting<br> behind the counter with<br> a fucking Magnum in his hand.<br> Try walkin' into one of those places<br> with nothing but a phone.<br> See how far that gets you.<br> Forget it.<br> - We're out of it.<br> - Well, what then, day jobs?<br> - Not in this life.<br> - What then?<br> Garon, coffee!<br> This place.<br> Garon means boy.<br> This place?<br> A coffee shop?<br> What's wrong with that?<br> Nobody ever robs restaurants.<br> Why not?<br> Bars, liquor stores,<br> gas stations; you get your head<br> blown off stickin' up one of them.<br> Restaurants, on the other hand,<br> you catch with their pants down.<br> They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br> Not as expectin' anyway.<br> - I bet you could cut down on the<br> hero factor in a place like this.<br> - Correct.<br> Same as banks,<br> these places are insured.<br> Manager.<br> He don't give a fuck.<br> They're just trying to get you out<br> before you start pluggin' the diners.<br> Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.<br> No way they're takin' a bullet<br> for the register.<br> Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br> paid $1.50 an hour...<br> really give a fuck<br> you're stealin' from the owner?<br> Customers sittin' there<br> with food in their mouths,<br> they don't know what's goin' on.<br> One minute, they're havin'<br> a Denver omelet, the next, someone<br> is stickin' a gun in their face.<br> See, I got the idea the last<br> liquor store we stuck up, remember?<br> - All the customers kept comin' in.<br> - Yeah.<br> You got the idea<br> of takin' their wallets.<br> Now, that was a good idea.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Made more from the wallets<br> than we did from the register.<br> - Yes, we did.<br> - A lot of people come to restaurants.<br> - A lot of wallets.<br> - Pretty smart, huh?<br> Pretty smart.<br> I'm ready. Let's do it.<br> Right now, right here.<br> - Come on.<br> - All right. Same as<br> last time, remember?<br> You're crowd control.<br> I'll handle the employees.<br> - I love you, Pumpkin.<br> - I love you, Honey Bunny.<br> Everybody be cool!<br> This is a robbery!<br> Any of you fucking pricks move,<br> and I'll execute<br> every motherfuckin' last one of you.<br> and I'll execute<br> every motherfuckin' last one of you.<br> LoS PiRaTaS 2002<br> by Terrok <br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get down with the boogie<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get it on<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get down with the boogie<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get it on<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get up with the boogie<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get up with the get down<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Get down and boogie<br> - Jungle boogie<br> - Shake it around<br> - Okay, so tell me again<br> about the hash bars.<br> - Okay, what you want to know?<br> - Hash is legal there, right?<br> - It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.<br> You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br> roll a joint and start puffin' away.<br> I mean, they want you to smoke in<br> your home or certain designated places.<br> - Those are hash bars?<br> - Yeah. It breaks down like this.<br> It's legal to buy it.<br> It's legal to own it.<br> And if you're the proprietor<br> of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.<br> It's illegal to carry it,<br> but-but that doesn't matter,<br> 'cause get a load of this.<br> If you get stopped by a cop<br> in Amsterdam, it's illegal<br> for them to search you.<br> - I mean, that's a right the cops<br> in Amsterdam don't have.<br> - Oh, man! I'm goin'.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> I'm fuckin' goin'.<br> I know, baby.<br> You'd dig it the most.<br> - But you know what the funniest thing<br> about Europe is?<br> - What?<br> It's the little differences.<br> I mean, they got the same shit<br> over there that they got here,<br> - but it's just there,<br> it's a little different.<br> - Example.<br> You can walk into a movie theater<br> in Amsterdam and buy a beer.<br> And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br> I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.<br> And in Paris, you can buy<br> a beer in McDonald's.<br> You know what they call...<br> a Quarter-Pounder<br> with Cheese in Paris?<br> They don't call it<br> a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?<br> They got the metric system.<br> They wouldn't know what the fuck<br> a Quarter-Pounder is.<br> - What do they call it?<br> - They call it a Royale with Cheese.<br> - Royale with Cheese.<br> - That's right.<br> What do they call a Big Mac?<br> Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br> but they call it Le Big Mac.<br> Le Big Mac.<br> - What do they call a Whopper?<br> - I don't know. I didn't<br> go into Burger King.<br> - You know what they put on French fries<br> in Holland instead of ketchup?<br> - What?<br> - Mayonnaise.<br> - Goddamn!<br> - I seen'em do it, man.<br> They fuckin' drown'em in that shit.<br> - Yuck.<br> We should have shotguns<br> for this kind of deal.<br> - How many up there?<br> - Three or four.<br> - That's countin' our guy?<br> - Not sure.<br> - So that means that it could be<br> up to five guys up there?<br> - It's possible.<br> We should have<br> fuckin' shotguns.<br> - What's her name?<br> - Mia.<br> - Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?<br> - I don't know.<br> However people meet people.<br> She used to be a actress.<br> Oh, really?<br> She do anything I'd have seen?<br> - I think her biggest deal<br> was she starred in a pilot.<br> - Pilot? What's a pilot?<br> - Well, you know the shows on TV?<br> - I don't watch TV.<br> Yeah, but you are aware that there<br> is an invention called television,<br> - and on this invention<br> they show shows, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> The way they pick TV shows is they make<br> one show. That show's called a pilot.<br> Then they show that one show<br> to the people who pick shows...<br> and on the strength of that<br> one show, they decide if<br> they wanna make more shows.<br> Some get chosen and<br> become television programs.<br> Some don't, become nothin'.<br> She starred in one of the ones<br> that became nothing.<br> You remember<br> Antwan Rockamora?<br> Half-black, half-Samoan.<br> Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."<br> - Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?<br> - I wouldn't go so far as to<br> call the brother fat.<br> I mean, he got a weight problem.<br> What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.<br> - I think I know who you mean.<br> What about him?<br> - Marsellus fucked him up good.<br> Word 'round the campfire is<br> it was on account of<br> Marsellus Wallace's wife.<br> - So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br> - No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.<br> - Well, then what then?<br> - He gave her a foot massage.<br> A foot massage?<br> - That's it?<br> Then what'd Marsellus do?<br> Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br> They took him out on his patio.<br> Threw his ass over the balcony.<br> Nigger fell four stories.<br> He had a little garden down<br> at the bottom enclosed in glass,<br> like a greenhouse.<br> Nigger fell through that.<br> Since then, he kind of<br> developed a speech impediment.<br> - That's a damn shame.<br> - But still, you play<br> with matches, you get burned.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's<br> new bride a foot massage.<br> You don't think he overreacted?<br> Antwan didn't expect Marsellus<br> to react the way he did,<br> but he had to expect a reaction.<br> It was a foot massage.<br> A foot massage is nothin'.<br> I give my mother a foot massage.<br> It's laying your hands in a familiar way<br> on Marsellus's new wife.<br> I mean, is it as bad as eatin'<br> her pussy out? No, but it's<br> the same fuckin' ballpark.<br> Whoa, stop right there.<br> Eatin' the bitch out...<br> and givin' the bitch a foot massage<br> ain't even the same fucking thing.<br> - It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br> - Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.<br> Now, look, maybe your method<br> of massage differs from mine.<br> But touchin' his wife's feet<br> and sticking your tongue<br> in the holiest of holies...<br> ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;<br> it ain't the same league;<br> it ain't the same fuckin' sport.<br> - Foot massages don't mean shit!<br> - Have you ever given a foot massage?<br> Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.<br> - I'm the foot fuckin' master.<br> - You given a lot of them?<br> Shit, yeah!<br> Got my technique down and everything.<br> I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.<br> Would you give a guy<br> a foot massage?<br> - Fuck you.<br> - You give'em a lot?<br> - Fuck you.<br> - You know, I'm kind of tired.<br> I could use a foot massage.<br> - Yo, yo, yo, man.<br> You best back off.<br> I'm gettin' a little pissed here.<br> - This is the door.<br> - Yeah, it is.<br> What time you got?<br> No, it ain't quite time yet.<br> Come on. Let's hang back.<br> Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man<br> a foot massage don't make it right...<br> for Marsellus to throw<br> Antwan off a building into<br> a glass motherfuckin' house,<br> fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;<br> that shit ain't right.<br> Motherfucker do that shit to me,<br> he better paralyze my ass,<br> 'cause I kill the motherfucker.<br> I ain't sayin' it's right,<br> but you sayin' a massage don't mean<br> nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.<br> Now, look, I've given a million<br> ladies a million foot massages,<br> and they all meant somethin'.<br> We act like they don't,<br> but they do. That's what's<br> so fuckin' cool about them.<br> There's a sensuous thing goin' on...<br> where you don't talk about it,<br> but you know it and she knows it.<br> Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br> should've fuckin' better known better.<br> That's his fuckin' wife, man.<br> This ain't a man with a sense<br> of humor about this shit.<br> You know what I'm sayin'?<br> It's an interestin' point.<br> Come on.<br> Let's get into character.<br> - What's her name again?<br> - Mia.<br> - Mia.<br> - Why you so interested<br> in big man's wife?<br> He's goin' out of town, Florida.<br> And he asked me if I'd take care<br> of her while he's gone.<br> - Take care of her?<br> - No, man. Just take her out.<br> Show her a good time.<br> Make sure she don't get lonely.<br> You're gonna be takin'<br> Mia Wallace out on a date?<br> It is not a date.<br> It's just like if you were<br> gonna take your buddy's wife<br> to a movie or somethin'.<br> - It's just good company, that's all.<br> - It's not a date.<br> It's definitely not a date.<br> Hey, kids.<br> How you boys doin'?<br> Hey, keep chillin'.<br> You know who we are?<br> We're associates of your<br> business partner, Marsellus Wallace.<br> You do remember<br> your business partner, don't you?<br> Now, let me take<br> a wild guess here.<br> - You're Brett, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> I thought so. You remember<br> your business partner Marsellus Wallace,<br> don't ya, Brett?<br> Yeah, I remember.<br> Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br> caught you boys at breakfast.<br> Sorry about that.<br> Whatcha havin'?<br> Hamburgers.<br> Hamburgers! The cornerstone<br> of any nutritious breakfast.<br> What kind of hamburgers?<br> - Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Where'd you get 'em?<br> McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?<br> - Where?<br> - Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.<br> Big Kahuna Burger!<br> That's that Hawaiian burger joint.<br> I hear they got some tasty burgers.<br> I ain't never had one myself.<br> How are they?<br> They're... They're good.<br> You mind if I try<br> one of yours?<br> - This is yours here, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> This is a tasty burger!<br> Vincent!<br> You ever had<br> a Big Kahuna burger?<br> Want a bite?<br> They're real tasty.<br> - I ain't hungry.<br> - Well, if you like burgers,<br> give 'em a try sometime.<br> Me, I can't usually get 'em<br> 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,<br> which pretty much makes me<br> a vegetarian.<br> But I do love the taste<br> of a good burger.<br> You know what they call<br> a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese<br> in France?<br> - No.<br> - Tell 'em, Vincent.<br> - A Royale with Cheese.<br> - A Royale with Cheese.<br> You know why they call it that?<br> Uh, because of<br> the metric system?<br> Check out the big brain<br> on Brett!<br> You're a smart motherfucker.<br> That's right.

There's two Monroes.<br> - No, there's not.<br> That is Marilyn Monroe.<br> That is Mamie Van Doren.<br> I don't see Jayne Mansfield,<br> so she must have the night off.<br> - Pretty smart.<br> - Yeah. I got my moments.<br> - So did you think of somethin' to say?<br> - Actually, I did.<br> However...<br> you seem like<br> a really nice person, and l...<br> - I don't want to offend you.<br> This doesn't sound like<br> the usual, mindless, boring,<br> gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.<br> This sounds like you<br> actually have somethin' to say.<br> Well, well, I do. I do.<br> - But you have<br> to promise not to be offended.<br> - No, no.<br> You can't promise somethin' like that.<br> I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.<br> You can ask me what you're gonna<br> ask me, and my natural response<br> could be to get offended.<br> Then, through no fault of my own,<br> I would have broken my promise.<br> - Let's just forget it.<br> - That's an impossibility.<br> Trying to forget anything<br> as intriguing as this would be<br> an exercise in futility.<br> - Is that a fact?<br> - And besides,<br> - isn't it more, uh, exciting<br> when you don't have permission?<br> - All right, all right.<br> Well, here goes.<br> What did you think about<br> what happened to Antwan?<br> - Who's Antwan?<br> - Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.<br> - He fell out of a window.<br> - Hmm. Hmm.<br> Well, that is one way to say it.<br> Another way to say it would be<br> that he was thrown out.<br> Another way would be<br> he was thrown out by Marsellus.<br> Yet even another way is to say<br> he was thrown out of a window<br> by Marsellus because of you.<br> - Is that a fact?<br> - No.<br> No, it's not a fact. It's just what<br> I heard. That's just what I heard.<br> - Who told you?<br> - They.<br> "They" talk a lot, don't they?<br> They certainly do.<br> They certainly do.<br> - Don't be shy, Vincent.<br> What else did "they" say?<br> - I'm... I'm not shy.<br> - Um...<br> - Did it involve the "F" word?<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> They just said that Antwan<br> had given you a foot massage.<br> - And?<br> - And... And nothin'.<br> That's it.<br> You heard Marsellus...<br> threw Tony Rocky Horror<br> out of a fourth-story window<br> for giving me a foot massage?<br> - And you believe that?<br> Well, at the time<br> I was told it sounded reasonable.<br> Marsellus throwing Tony out<br> of a fourth-story window...<br> for massaging my feet<br> seemed reasonable?<br> No, it seemed excessive,<br> but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.<br> I understand that Marsellus<br> is very protective of you.<br> A husband being protective<br> of his wife is one thing.<br> A husband almost killing<br> another man for touching<br> his wife's feet is something else.<br> But did it happen?<br> Only thing Antwan ever touched<br> of mine was my hand when he<br> shook it... at my wedding.<br> Really?<br> Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus<br> threw Tony out that window...<br> except Marsellus and Tony.<br> When you little scamps get together,<br> you're worse than a sewing circle.<br> Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment<br> you've all been waiting for.<br> The world-famous<br> Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.<br> Now, this is where<br> one lucky couple...<br> will win this handsome trophy<br> that Marilyn here is holding.<br> Now, who will be<br> our first contestants?<br> - Right here!<br> - All right!<br> - I wanna dance.<br> - No, no, no, no, no.<br> No, no, no, no, no.

Stand up.<br> Now, do you remember when I told you<br> your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?<br> Well, this here is Captain Koons.<br> He was in the P.O.W. camp<br> with Daddy.<br> Hello, little man.<br> Boy, I sure heard<br> a bunch about you.<br> See, I was a good friend<br> of your dad's.<br> We were in that Hanoi<br> pit of hell together...<br> over five years.<br> Hopefully...<br> you'll never have to<br> experience this yourself,<br> but when two men are in a situation<br> like me and your dad were...<br> for as long as we were,<br> you take on certain responsibilities<br> of the other.<br> If it'd been me who'd...<br> not made it,<br> Major Coolidge'd be talking right now<br> to my son Jim.<br> But the way it turned out,<br> I'm talking to you.<br> Butch...<br> I got something for ya.<br> This watch I got here...<br> was first purchased<br> by your great-grandfather<br> during the first World War.<br> It was bought in a little general store<br> in Knoxville, Tennessee.<br> Made by the first company<br> to ever make wristwatches.<br> Up 'til then, people just<br> carried pocket watches.<br> It was bought<br> by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...<br> on the day he set sail for Paris.<br> This was your<br> great-grandfather's war watch,<br> and he wore it every day<br> he was in that war, and...<br> when he'd done his duty,<br> he went home to your great-grandmother,<br> took the watch off,<br> put it in an old coffee can,<br> and in that can it stayed...<br> until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,<br> was called upon by his country...<br> to go overseas and fight<br> the Germans once again.<br> This time they called it<br> World War ll.<br> Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br> to your granddad for good luck.<br> Unfortunately, Dane's luck<br> wasn't as good as his old man's.<br> Dane was a Marine,<br> and he was killed...<br> along with all the other Marines<br> at the battle of Wake lsland.<br> Your granddad was facing death.<br> He knew it.<br> None of those boys ever<br> had any illusions about<br> leaving that island alive,<br> so three days before the Japanese<br> took the island,<br> your granddad asked<br> a gunner on an Air Force transport,<br> name of Winocki...<br> a man he'd never met before<br> in his life...<br> to deliver to his infant son,<br> who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br> his gold watch.<br> Three days later, your granddad<br> was dead, but Winocki kept his word.<br> After the war was over,<br> he paid a visit to your grandmother,<br> delivering to your infant father<br> his dad's gold watch.<br> This watch.<br> This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br> when he was shot down over Hanoi.<br> He was captured,<br> put in a Vietnamese prison camp.<br> He knew if the gooks<br> ever saw the watch,<br> it'd be confiscated,<br> taken away.<br> The way your dad looked at it,<br> this watch was your birthright.<br> He'd be damned if any slope's<br> gonna put their greasy, yellow<br> hands on his boy's birthright,<br> so he hid it in one place he knew<br> he could hide something... his ass.<br> Five long years<br> he wore this watch up his ass.<br> Then he died of dysentery...<br> He give me the watch.<br> I hid this uncomfortable<br> hunk of metal up my ass two years.<br> Then...<br> after seven years,<br> I was sent home to my family and...<br> now...<br> Iittle man,<br> I give the watch to you.<br> It's time, Butch.<br> In the heavyweight division,<br> - in the right corner<br> wearing the blue trunks,<br> weighing 210 pounds,<br> Floyd Ray Wilson!<br> It's official. It's official.<br> - Wilson is dead!<br> - Well, Dan,<br> that had to be the bloodiest,<br> hands down, the most brutal fight<br> this city's ever seen.<br> Coolidge was out of there<br> faster than I've ever seen<br> a victorious boxer leave the ring.<br> - Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?<br> - My guess would be yes.<br> I could see the frenzy in his<br> eyes give way to the realization<br> of what he was doing.<br> - I think any man would've<br> left the ring that fast.<br> - Do you feel this tragedy...<br> is gonna affect<br> the world of boxing?<br> A tragedy like this can't help<br> but shake the world of boxing<br> to its very foundations.<br> It's of paramount importance,<br> during the sad weeks ahead,<br> the eyes of the W.B.A. remain...<br> Man, you know I didn't...<br> - Marsellus.<br> - No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.<br> I didn't do it.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Great.<br> I never thanked you<br> for dinner.<br> - What you got?<br> - He booked.<br> - His trainer?<br> - Says he don't know nothin'.<br> I believe him.<br> - I think Butch surprised<br> his ass same as us.<br> - No, we don't wanna "think."<br> We wanna know. Take him to<br> the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.<br> We'll find out for goddamn sure<br> what he knows and what he don't.<br> Butch's search...<br> How do you want it done?<br> I'm prepared to scour the Earth<br> for that motherfucker.<br> If Butch goes to Indochina, I want<br> a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...<br> ready to pop a cap in his ass.<br> I will take care of it.<br> Mister.<br> - Hey, mister.<br> - What?<br> You were in that fight,<br> the fight on the radio.<br> - You're the fighter?<br> - Whatever gave you that idea?<br> No, come on.<br> You're him.<br> I know you're him.<br> Tell me you're him.<br> I'm him.<br> You killed the other boxing man.<br> He's dead?<br> The radio said he was dead.<br> Sorry about that, Floyd.<br> What does it feel like?<br> What does what feel like?<br> Killing a man.<br> Beating another man to death<br> with your bare hands.<br> What are you, a weirdo?<br> No.<br> It is a subject<br> I have much interest in.<br> You are the first person<br> I have ever met who has killed somebody.<br> So?<br> - What does it feel like to kill a man?<br> I'll tell you what.<br> Give me one of them cigarettes<br> you got up there, and I'll<br> tell you all about it.<br> So, Esmeralda...<br> Villa Lobos...<br> Is that Mexican?<br> The name is Spanish,<br> but I am Colombian.<br> - That's some handle<br> you got there, honey.<br> - Thank you.<br> And what is your name?<br> Butch.<br> Butch.<br> - What does it mean?<br> - I'm an American, honey.<br> Our names don't mean shit.<br> So, moving right along,<br> Esmeralda,<br> what is it you want to know?<br> - I want to know what it<br> feels like to kill a man.<br> - I couldn't tell ya.<br> Didn't know he was dead<br> 'til you told me he was dead.<br> Now that I know he's dead,<br> you wanna know how I feel about it?<br> I don't feel<br> the least bit bad about it.<br> What the fuck'd I tell ya?<br> Huh?<br> As soon as the word got out<br> the fix was in, man, the odds<br> went through the roof.<br> I know. I know.<br> Unbelievable.<br> Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was<br> a better boxer, he'd still be alive.<br> If he never<br> laced up his gloves,<br> which he never shoulda done in the first<br> fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.<br> Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br> It's over now.<br> Yeah, well, enough about the poor,<br> unfortunate Mr. Floyd.<br> Let's talk about the rich<br> and prosperous Mr. Butch.<br> How many bookies did you<br> lay it around on?<br> All eight?<br> How long to collect?<br> So you'll have it all<br> by tomorrow night? No, I understand.<br> A few stragglers aside.<br> Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.<br> That is great news, man.<br> Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne<br> are gonna leave in the morning.<br> It'll probably take us<br> a couple days to get down to Knoxville.<br> Okay, my brother.<br> You're right.<br> You're goddamn right.<br> All right, Scotty, next time I see you,<br> it'll be on Tennessee time.<br> Cool, brother.<br> $45.60.<br> And, uh,<br> here's a little something<br> for the effort.<br> Now, if anybody asks you who your fare<br> was tonight, what are you gonna say?<br> The truth.<br> Three well-dressed,<br> slightly toasted Mexicans.<br> Bonsoir,<br> Esmeralda Villa Lobos.<br> Buenas Noches, Butch.<br> Whew.<br> Keep the light off.<br> - Is that better, Sugar Pop?<br> - Oui.<br> Hard day at the office?<br> Pretty hard.<br> Got in a fight.<br> Poor baby.<br> Can you make spoons?<br> You know what?<br> I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.<br> - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.<br> - I like the way you stink.<br> Let me take this jacket off.<br> - I was looking at myself in the mirror.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> I wish I had a pot.<br> You were looking<br> at yourself in the mirror,<br> and you wish you had some pot?<br> A pot.<br> A pot belly.<br> Pot bellies are sexy.<br> Well, you should be happy,<br> 'cause you have one.<br> Shut up, fatso.<br> I don't have a pot.<br> I have a bit of a tummy,<br> like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."<br> It's not the same thing.<br> I didn't know there was<br> such a difference between<br> a pot belly and a tummy.<br> The difference is huge.<br> Would you like it if I had a pot belly?<br> No.<br> Pot bellies make a man<br> look either oafish or like a gorilla.<br> But on a woman<br> a pot belly's very sexy.<br> The rest of you is normal... normal face,<br> normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...<br> but with a big,<br> perfectly round pot belly.<br> If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt<br> two sizes too small...<br> to accentuate it.<br> You think men<br> would find that attractive?<br> I don't give a damn<br> what men find attractive.<br> It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br> to the touch and pleasing to the eye...<br> is seldom the same.<br> If you had a pot belly,<br> I would punch you in it.<br> - You'd punch me in the belly?<br> - Right in the belly.<br> Ohh! I'd smother you!<br> - I'd drop it right on your face<br> 'til you couldn't breathe!<br> - You'd do that?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Promise?<br> - Yeah.<br> Did you get everything?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - Good job, Sugar Pop.<br> Did everything<br> go as planned?<br> - You didn't listen to the... Ow!<br> You didn't listen to the radio?<br> I never listen to your fights.<br> Were you the winner?<br> I won, all right.<br> - Are you still retiring?<br> - Sure am.<br> So it all worked out<br> in the finish.<br> We're not at the finish yet, baby.<br> We're in a lot of danger,<br> aren't we?<br> If they find us,<br> they'll kill us, won't they?<br> But they won't find us,<br> will they?<br> Do you still want me<br> to go with you?<br> I don't want to be a burden<br> or a nuisance. It's...<br> Say it.<br> - Fabienne,<br> I want you to be with me.<br> - Forever?<br> - Forever and ever.<br> Do you love me?<br> Very, very much.<br> - Butch.<br> - Yes?<br> Will you give me<br> oral pleasure?<br> Will you kiss it?<br> But you first.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Butch.<br> Mon amour.<br> L'aventure commence.<br> I think I cracked a rib.<br> - Giving me oral pleasure?<br> - No, retard, from the fight.<br> - Don't call me "retard."<br> - My name is Fabby.<br> - My name is Fabienne!<br> - Stop it.<br> - Stop it!<br> - My name is Fabi...<br> Shut up, fuckhead!<br> I hate that mongoloid voice.<br> Okay, okay.<br> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<br> - I take it back.<br> Will you hand me a dry towel,<br> Miss Beautiful Tulip?<br> - Oh, I like that.<br> I like being called a tulip.<br> "Tulip" is much better<br> than "mongoloid."<br> I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br> I called you a retard.<br> And I took it back.<br> - Butch?<br> Yes, Lemon Pie?<br> - Where are we going to go?<br> - Well, I'm not sure yet.<br> Wherever you want.<br> We're gonna get a lot<br> of money from this,<br> but it ain't gonna be<br> the kind of money...<br> that we can live like hogs<br> in the fathouse forever.<br> I was thinking maybe we could go<br> down someplace in the South Pacific.<br> Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna<br> carry us a long way down there.<br> - If we wanted,<br> we could live in Bora Bora?<br> - You betcha.<br> And if after a while you didn't<br> dig that, we could go someplace else.<br> Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.<br> But I do not speak Spanish.<br> Well, you do not speak<br> Bora-Boran either.<br> Besides, Mexican's easy.<br> - Donde esta el zapateria?<br> - What does that mean?<br> Where is the shoe store?<br> - Donde esta...<br> - Spit, please.<br> - Donde esta el zapateria?<br> - Excellent pronunciation.<br> You'll be my little mamacita<br> in no time.<br> - Que hora es?<br> - Que hora es?<br> - What time is it?<br> - What time is it?<br> Time for bed.<br> Sweet dreams, jellybean.<br> Butch?<br> Never mind.<br> Merde!

God.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Almost nine in the morning.<br> - What time does our train arrive?<br> - Eleven.<br> - You know what I'm gonna<br> have for breakfast?<br> - What, Lemon Pie?<br> I'm gonna order a big plate<br> of blueberry pancakes...<br> with maple syrup,<br> eggs over easy<br> and five sausages.<br> Anything to drink with that?<br> Wow, that looks nice.<br> To drink... A tall glass<br> of orange juice...<br> and a black cup of coffee.<br> - After that, I'm going to<br> have a slice of pie.<br> - Pie for breakfast?<br> - Any time of the day<br> is a good time for pie.<br> Blueberry pie<br> to go with the pancakes.<br> And on top, a thin slice<br> of melted cheese.<br> Where's my watch?<br> It's there.<br> - No, it's not.<br> - Have you looked?<br> Yes, I've fuckin' looked.<br> What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?<br> You sure you got it?<br> Yes.<br> Bedside table drawer.<br> - On the little kangaroo?<br> - Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.<br> Yeah, well,<br> it's not here now.<br> - Well, it should be.<br> Yes, it most definitely should be,<br> but it's not here now!<br> So where the fuck is it?<br> Fabienne,<br> where's my father's fucking watch?<br> Do you have any idea what he had<br> to go through to get me that watch?<br> I don't have time to go into it,<br> but he went through a lot.<br> All this other shit you could've set<br> on fire, but I specifically reminded<br> you not to forget the fucking watch.<br> Now think.<br> - Did you get it?<br> - I believe so.<br> "You believe so"?<br> What the fuck does that mean?<br> You either did or didn't get it.<br> Then I did.<br> Are you sure?<br> No.<br> Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!<br> Motherfucker!<br> Motherfuckin'...<br> Do you know how fucking stupid<br> you fucking are?<br> No!<br> It's not your fault.<br> You left it at the apartment.<br> If you left it at the apartment,<br> it's not your fault.<br> I had you bring<br> a bunch of stuff.<br> I reminded you about it,<br> but I didn't illustrate<br> how personal the watch was to me.<br> If all I gave a fuck about was<br> the watch, I shoulda told you that.<br> You're not a mind reader.<br> Are you?<br> I... I'm sorry.<br> Don't be. Just means<br> I can't have breakfast with you.<br> Why does it mean that?<br> Because I gotta go back to my apartment<br> and get my watch.<br> Won't the gangsters<br> be looking for you there?<br> Well, that's what<br> I'm gonna find out.<br> If they are, and I don't think<br> I can handle it,<br> then I'll split.<br> I saw your watch.

Did you forget<br> that someone was in there...<br> with a goddamn hand cannon?<br> You see the size of that gun he fired<br> at us? It was bigger than him.<br> We should be fuckin' dead, man.<br> I know.<br> We was lucky.<br> No, no, no, no.<br> That shit wasn't luck.<br> - Yeah, maybe.<br> - This was divine intervention.<br> You know what<br> divine intervention is?<br> I think so.<br> That means that God came down<br> from Heaven and stopped the bullets.<br> That's right.<br> That's exactly what it means.<br> God came down from Heaven<br> and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.<br> I think it's time for us<br> to leave, Jules.<br> Don't do that.<br> Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!<br> - What just happened here<br> was a fuckin' miracle!<br> - Chill. This shit happens.<br> Wrong! Wrong.<br> This shit doesn't "just happen."<br> Do you want to continue<br> this theological discussion in a car...<br> or in a jailhouse<br> with the cops?<br> We should be fuckin' dead,<br> my friend!<br> What happened here was a miracle, and I<br> want you to fucking acknowledge it!<br> All right, it was a miracle.<br> Can we go now?<br> Let's go, nigger!<br> Come on!

He didn't hit nothin'.<br> Okay? It was just<br> him and this guy.<br> I mean, you know, it's,<br> it's freaky, but it happens.<br> You wanna play blind man,<br> go walk with the shepherd,<br> but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.<br> - What the fuck does that mean?<br> - It means that's it for me.<br> From here on in, you can<br> consider my ass retired.<br> - Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.<br> - Don't blaspheme.<br> - I said, don't do that!<br> - Hey, why are you fuckin'<br> freakin' out on us?<br> Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today...<br> I'm through.<br> - Why don't you tell him<br> at the same time why?<br> - Don't worry, I will.<br> - And I bet you $10,000<br> he laughs his ass off.<br> - I don't give a damn if he does.<br> Marvin, what do you make of all this?<br> Man, I don't even<br> have an opinion.<br> You gotta have an opinion. You think<br> God came down from Heaven and stopped...<br> - What the fuck's happenin'?<br> - Aw, shit, man!<br> - Aw, man!<br> - Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.<br> - Why the fuck'd you do that?<br> I didn't mean it.<br> It was an accident.<br> - Man, I seen some crazy-ass<br> shit in my time, but this...<br> - Chill out, man!<br> It was an accident. We probably<br> went over a bump or somethin'.<br> The car ain't hit<br> no motherfuckin' bump.<br> I didn't mean to shoot<br> the son of a bitch. The gun went off.<br> Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on<br> a city street in broad daylight here!<br> - I don't believe it!<br> - Well, believe it now, motherfucker!<br> We gotta get this car off<br> the road. Cops notice shit<br> like a car drenched in blood.<br> - Just take it to<br> a friendly place, that's all!<br> - This is the Valley, Vincent.<br> Marsellus ain't got<br> no friendly places in the Valley.<br> - Well, Jules, this ain't<br> my fuckin' town, man!<br> - Shit!<br> - What you doing?<br> - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.<br> -Where's Toluca Lake?<br> -Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.<br> If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br> I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,<br> 'cause I ain't got<br> no other partners in 818.<br> Jimmie, how you doin', man?<br> It's Jules. Just listen up, man.<br> Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we<br> gotta get it off the road, pronto.<br> I need to use your garage<br> for a couple hours.<br> We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br> with this Jimmie situation.<br> He's one remark away<br> from kickin' our asses out the door.<br> - If he does, what do we do?<br> - We ain't leavin'<br> 'til we make a couple calls,<br> but I don't want it to reach<br> that pitch... Jimmie's a friend.<br> You don't come into your friend's house<br> and start tellin' him what's what.<br> Just tell him<br> not to be abusive.<br> He kinda freaked out back there<br> when he saw Marvin.<br> Put yourself in his position...<br> It's 8:00 in the morning,<br> he just woke up.<br> He wasn't expectin' this shit.<br> We gotta remember here<br> who's doin' who a favor.<br> If that favor means I gotta<br> take shit, he can stick that<br> favor straight up his ass.<br> - Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd<br> you just do to his towel, man?<br> - I was dryin' my hands!<br> - You're supposed to wash 'em first!<br> - You watched me wash 'em.<br> - I watched you get'em wet.<br> - I was washin' 'em.<br> This shit's hard to get off.<br> Maybe if he'd had Lava<br> I coulda done a better job.<br> I used the same<br> fuckin' soap you did,<br> and when I finished, the towel<br> didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!<br> What if he was to come in here<br> and see his towel like this?<br> It's shit like this that's gonna bring<br> this situation to a head, man!<br> Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br> or nothin', all right?<br> You know I respect you and all.<br> But just don't put me<br> in this position, all right?<br> All right.<br> Fine. Fine.<br> Ask me nice like that,<br> no problem.<br> Just go handle your friend.<br> Go ahead. I don't care.<br> Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!<br> This some serious<br> gourmet shit.<br> Me and Vincent<br> would've been satisfied...<br> with some freeze-dried<br> Taster's Choice.<br> Right?<br> And he springs this<br> serious gourmet shit on us.<br> - What flavor is this?<br> - Knock it off, Julie.<br> - What?<br> - I don't need you to tell me<br> how fuckin' good my coffee is.<br> I'm the one who buys it.<br> I know how good it is.<br> When Bonnie goes shopping,<br> she buys shit.<br> I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause<br> when I drink it, I wanna taste it.<br> But you know what's on<br> my mind right now? It ain't<br> the coffee in my kitchen.<br> It's the dead nigger<br> in my garage.<br> - Jimmie, don't even worry...<br> - Don't tell me about anything.<br> I wanna ask you a question.<br> When you came pulling in here,<br> did you notice the sign<br> on the front of my house that said,<br> "Dead Nigger Storage"?<br> - You know I ain't seen no...<br> - Did you notice the sign on<br> the front of my house...<br> that said,<br> "Dead Nigger Storage"?<br> No. I didn't.<br> - You know why you didn't<br> see that sign?<br> - Why?<br> 'Cause it ain't there,<br> 'cause storing dead niggers<br> ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!<br> - We're not gonna store<br> the motherfucker...<br> - Don't you fuckin' realize...<br> that if Bonnie comes home and<br> finds a dead body in her house,<br> I'm gonna get divorced?<br> No marriage counselor.<br> No trial separation.<br> I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.<br> Okay? And I don't wanna<br> get fuckin' divorced!<br> Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,<br> but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.<br> Jimmie, Jimmie,<br> she ain't gonna leave you.<br> Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!<br> Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.<br> There's nothin' you're gonna<br> say that's gonna make me forget<br> I love my wife. Is there?<br> Now, look, you know, she comes home<br> from work in about an hour and a half.<br> The graveyard shift<br> at the hospital.<br> You gotta make some phone calls?<br> You gotta call some people?<br> Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br> out of my house before she gets here.<br> That's Kool and the Gang.<br> We don't wanna fuck your shit up.<br> All I wanna do is call my people<br> and get 'em to bring us in.<br> You're fucking my shit up<br> right now!<br> You're gonna fuck my shit up<br> big time if Bonnie comes home.<br> Do me that favor, all right?<br> The phone is in my bedroom.<br> I suggest you get going.<br> Well, say she comes home.<br> What do you think she'll do?<br> Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.<br> That ain't no kinda answer.<br> I mean, you know, I don't.<br> How much? A lot or a little?<br> You got to appreciate<br> what an explosive element...<br> this Bonnie situation is.<br> She comes home from a hard day's work,<br> finds a bunch of gangsters<br> in her kitchen...<br> doing a bunch of gangster shit,<br> there ain't no tellin'<br> what she's liable to do.<br> Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.<br> All I'm doing is<br> contemplating the ifs.<br> I don't wanna hear about<br> no motherfuckin' ifs!<br> All I want to hear from your ass<br> is, "You ain't got no problem,<br> Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.<br> Chill them niggers out<br> and wait for the cavalry,<br> which should be coming directly."<br> You ain't got no problem, Jules.<br> I'm on the motherfucker.<br> Chill them niggers out and wait for<br> the Wolf, who should be coming directly.<br> You sendin' the Wolf?<br> Oh, you feel better,<br> motherfucker?<br> Shit, yeah, negro!<br> That's all you had to say!<br> - She the hysterical type?<br> - When is she due?<br> Give me<br> the principals' names again.<br> Place your bets.<br> - Jules. Mm-hmm.<br> - Cards, please.<br> Vincent.<br> Jimmie.<br> Bonnie.<br> It's thirty minutes away.<br> I'll be there in ten.<br> You're... Jimmie, right?<br> This is your house?<br> - It sure is.<br> - I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.<br> - Good. We got one.<br> - So I heard. May I come in?<br> Uh, yeah. Please do.<br> You must be Jules.<br> Which would make you... Vincent.<br> Let's get down<br> to brass tacks, gentlemen.<br> If I was informed correctly, the clock<br> is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?<br> Uh, one hundred percent.<br> - Your wife Bonnie comes home<br> at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> I was led to believe if she<br> comes home and finds us here,<br> she wouldn't appreciate it much.<br> - She wouldn't at that.<br> - That gives us 40 minutes<br> to get the fuck outta Dodge,<br> which, if you do what I say,<br> when I say it, should be plenty.<br> Now, you got a corpse<br> in a car, minus a head,<br> in a garage. Take me to it.<br> - Jimmie.<br> Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I<br> smelled some coffee back there.<br> - Would you make me a cup?<br> - Uh, yeah, sure.<br> Oh, uh, um,<br> how do you take it?<br> Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.<br> About the car, is there anything<br> I need to know? Does it stall?<br> Does it smoke? Does it make<br> a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?<br> - Aside from how it looks,<br> the car's cool.<br> - Positive?<br> Don't get me on the road and I find out<br> the brake lights don't work.<br> - As far as I know,<br> the motherfucker's tip-top.<br> - Good enough.<br> Let's go back<br> to the kitchen.<br> - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.<br> - Thank you, Jimmie.<br> Okay, first thing.<br> You two.<br> Take the body,<br> stick it in the trunk.<br> This looks to be<br> a pretty domesticated house.<br> - That would lead me to believe<br> you got cleansers and shit.<br> - Yeah. Under the sink.<br> Good. What I need you two fellas to do<br> is take those cleaning products...<br> and clean the inside of the car...<br> I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.<br> Go in the back seat, scoop up all<br> those little pieces of brain and skull.<br> Get it out of there.<br> Wipe down the upholstery.<br> It don't need to be spick-and-span.<br> You don't need to eat off it.<br> Just give it a good once-over.<br> What you need to take care of<br> are the really messy parts.<br> The pools of blood that have collected,<br> you gotta soak that shit up.<br> We need to raid<br> your linen closet.<br> I need blankets,<br> I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.<br> The thicker the better,<br> the darker the better.<br> No whites. Can't use 'em.<br> We'll need to camouflage the front seat<br> and back seat and floorboards...<br> with quilts and blankets,<br> so if a cop starts stickin'<br> his big snout in the car,<br> the subterfuge won't last,<br> but at a glance the car<br> will appear to be normal.<br> Jimmie, lead the way.<br> Boys, get to work.<br> "Please" would be nice.<br> - Come again?<br> - I said, a "please" would be nice.<br> Get it straight, buster.<br> I'm not here to say please.<br> I'm here to tell you what to do.<br> And if self-preservation<br> is an instinct you possess,<br> you'd better fuckin' do it<br> and do it quick.<br> I'm here to help. If my help's<br> not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.<br> No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br> your help is definitely appreciated.<br> Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't<br> mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.<br> I just don't like people<br> barkin' orders at me.<br> If I'm curt with you,<br> it's because time is a factor.<br> I think fast, I talk fast,<br> and I need you guys to act fast<br> if you wanna get out of this.<br> So pretty please, with sugar on top,<br> clean the fuckin' car.<br> Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br> all right? I can feel your look.<br> It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.<br> Green.<br> Nothin' except for<br> the mess inside.<br> About 20 minutes.<br> Nobody who'll be missed.<br> You're a good man, Joe.<br> Thanks a bunch.<br> - How we comin', Jimmie?<br> - Pretty good.<br> - I got it all here, but, uh,<br> - Mr. Wolf,<br> you gotta understand something.<br> - Winston, Jimmie, Winston.<br> Okay.

Most definitely.<br> - Yeah.<br> Fuck.<br> What you gonna do then?<br> Well, that's what I been<br> sitting here contemplating.<br> First I'm gonna deliver<br> this case to Marsellus.<br> Then, basically, I'm just<br> gonna walk the Earth.<br> - What you mean, "walk the Earth"?<br> - Like Caine in Kung Fu.<br> Walk from place to place,<br> meet people, get in adventures.<br> And how long do you intend<br> to walk the Earth?<br> - 'Til God puts me<br> where He wants me to be.<br> - What if He don't do that?<br> - If it takes forever,<br> then I'll walk forever.<br> - So you decided to be a bum.<br> I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br> No more, no less.<br> No, Jules,<br> you decided to be a bum,<br> just like all those pieces of shit<br> out there who beg for change,<br> who sleep in garbage bins,<br> eat what I throw away.<br> They got a name for that, Jules.<br> It's called a bum.<br> And without a job,<br> a residence or legal tender,<br> that's what you're gonna be, man.<br> You're gonna be<br> a fuckin' bum.<br> Look, my friend,<br> this is just where you and I differ.<br> Garon!

I was sittin' here<br> eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,<br> replayin' the incident<br> in my head,<br> when I had what alcoholics refer to<br> as a moment of clarity.<br> Fuck.

Give'em<br> what you got and get'em outta here!<br> Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't<br> none of your goddamn business!<br> Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.<br> No problem.<br> I got it under control.<br> Now, I'm gonna count to three.<br> If you don't open that case,<br> I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.<br> We clear?<br> One.<br> Two.<br> - Three.<br> - Okay, Ringo.<br> You win.<br> It's yours.<br> - Open it.<br> Hey, what is it?<br> What is it?<br> Is that what I think it is?<br> It's beautiful.<br> Goddamn it, what is it?<br> You let him go!<br> You let him go!<br> - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!<br> - Tell that bitch to be cool.<br> - Say, "Bitch, be cool!"<br> Say, "Bitch, be cool!"<br> - Be cool!

And what's Fonzie like?<br> - Come on, Yolanda!<br> What's Fonzie like?<br> - He's cool.<br> - What?<br> - Cool.<br> Correctamundo.<br> And that's what we're gonna be.<br> We're gonna be cool.<br> Now, Ringo,<br> I'm gonna count to three.<br> And when I count three,<br> I want you to<br> let go of your gun,<br> put your palms flat on the table<br> and sit your ass down.<br> And when you do it,<br> you do it cool.<br> You ready?<br> One,<br> two,<br> three.<br> - Okay, now you let him go!<br> - Yolanda!<br> I thought you were gonna<br> be cool. Now, when you yell<br> at me, it makes me nervous.<br> When I get nervous,<br> I get scared.<br> When motherfuckers get scared,<br> that's when motherfuckers<br> accidentally get shot.<br> Just know, you hurt him, you die.<br> Well, that seems to be<br> the situation.<br> But I don't want that.<br> And you don't want that.<br> And Ringo here definitely<br> doesn't want that.<br> So let's see what we can do.<br> Now... here's the situation.<br> Normally both your asses would be<br> dead as fuckin' fried chicken,<br> but you happened to pull this shit<br> while I'm in a transitional period,<br> and I don't wanna kill you;<br> I wanna help you.<br> But I can't give you this case,<br> 'cause it don't belong to me.<br> Besides, I been through too much shit<br> over this case this morning...<br> to just hand it over<br> to your dumb ass.<br> - Vincent!<br> - Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br> - Get back!<br> It's cool!<br> We still just talkin'.<br> - Come on. Point the gun at me.<br> Point the gun at me. There you go.<br> Now, Vincent, you just hang back...<br> and don't do<br> a goddamn thing.<br> Tell her it's still cool.<br> - It's still cool, Honey Bunny.<br> - How we doin', baby?<br> I... I gotta go pee.<br> I wanna go home.<br> Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br> And Ringo's proud of you.<br> It's almost over.<br> Tell her you're proud of her.<br> - I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.<br> - I love you.<br> - I love you too, Honey Bunny.<br> - Now,<br> I want you to go in that bag<br> and find my wallet.<br> - Which one is it?<br> - It's the one that says<br> "Bad Motherfucker."<br> That's it.<br> That's my bad motherfucker.<br> Open it up.<br> Take out the money.<br> Count it.<br> How much is there?<br> About 1,500 dollars.<br> Okay, put it in your pocket.<br> It's yours.<br> Now, with the rest<br> of those wallets and the register,<br> that makes this a pretty successful<br> little score, huh?<br> Jules, you give that fuckin'<br> nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll<br> shoot him on general principle.<br> No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna<br> do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!<br> Vince, shut the fuck up!<br> - Shut up!<br> - Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.<br> Now, I ain't givin' it<br> to him, Vincent.<br> I'm buyin' something<br> for my money.<br> - Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?<br> - What?<br> Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br> so I don't have to kill your ass.<br> You read the Bible, Ringo?<br> Not regularly, no.<br> Well, there's this passage<br> I got memorized.<br> Ezekiel 25:17.<br> "The path of the righteous man<br> is beset on all sides...<br> by the inequities<br> of the selfish...<br> and the tyranny of evil men.<br> Blessed is he who,<br> in the name of charity and good will,<br> shepherds the weak<br> through the valley of darkness,<br> for he is truly his brother's keeper<br> and the finder of lost children.<br> And I will strike down upon thee with<br> great vengeance and furious anger...<br> those who attempt to poison<br> and destroy My brothers.<br> And you will know<br> I am the Lord...<br> when I lay My vengeance<br> upon you."<br> I been sayin' that shit for years,<br> and if you heard it,<br> that meant your ass.<br> I never gave much thought<br> to what it meant.<br> I just thought it was some coldblooded<br> shit to say to a motherfucker...<br> before I popped a cap<br> in his ass.<br> But I saw some shit this morning<br> made me think twice.<br> See, now I'm thinkin'<br> maybe it means...<br> you're the evil man,<br> and I'm the righteous man,<br> and Mr. 9-millimeter here,<br> he's the shepherd...<br> protecting my righteous ass<br> in the valley of darkness.<br> Or it could mean...<br> you're the righteous man,<br> and I'm the shepherd,<br> and it's the world<br> that's evil and selfish.<br> Now, I'd like that.<br> But that shit<br> ain't the truth.<br> The truth is,<br> you're the weak...<br> and I'm the tyranny<br> of evil men.<br> But I'm tryin', Ringo.<br> I'm tryin' real hard...<br> to be the shepherd.<br> Go.<br> I think we should be<br> leaving now.<br> - Yeah, that's probably a good idea.<br>
