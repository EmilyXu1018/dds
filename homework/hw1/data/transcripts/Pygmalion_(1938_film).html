I don't mind<br> if I do.<br> How much do you propose<br> to pay me for the lessons?<br> Oh, I know<br> what's right.<br> A lady friend of mine,<br> she gets French lessons...<br> at 18 pence an hour<br> from a real French gentleman.<br> But you wouldn't have the nerve to ask<br> the same for teachin' me me own language...<br> as what you would for French, so<br> I won't give you more than a shillin'.<br> - Take it or leave it.<br> - I, um-<br> I'll take it.<br> You know, Pickering,<br> a shilling to this girl is worth<br> It's handsome, enormous.<br> It's the biggest offer I've ever had.<br> - Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?<br> - Hold your tongue.<br> - But I ain't got 60 pounds.<br> - Nobody's going to touch your money.<br> Someone's going to touch you with a<br> broomstick if you don't stop snivelling.<br> Anyone would think<br> he was my father.<br> Higgins,<br> I'm interested.<br> - What about that boast that you could pass her off as a duchess?<br> - What about it?<br> I'd say you're the greatest<br> teacher alive if you make that good.<br> I'd bet you all the expenses<br> of the experiment you can't do it.<br> - And I'll pay for the lessons.<br> - Oh, you're real good.<br> - Come here. Sit down.<br> - Thank you, Captain.<br> This is almost<br> irresistible.<br> She's so<br> deliciously low,<br> so horribly dirty.<br> Oh! I ain't dirty.<br> I washed my face and hands<br> before I come, I did.<br> I shall make a duchess of this<br> draggle-tailed guttersnipe.<br> Oh!<br> In six months- in three, if she<br> has a good ear and a quick tongue-<br> I'll take her anywhere<br> and pass her off as anything.<br> We start today, this minute.<br> Mrs. Pearce, clean her.<br> Take off all her clothes<br> and burn them.<br> Order some new ones. Wrap her up<br> in brown paper till they come.<br> You're no gentleman, you ain't,<br> to talk of such things.<br> I'm a good girl, and I know<br> what the likes of you are.<br> We want none of your<br> slum prudery here, young woman.<br> You've got to learn to behave like<br> a duchess. Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.<br> - If she gives you trouble, wallop her.<br> - I'll call the police!<br> - I've no place to put her.<br> - Put her in the ashcan.<br> - You can't pick a girl up as if picking a pebble off the beach.<br> - Why not?<br> - She may be married.<br> - Garn!<br> As the girl very<br> properly says, "Garn!"<br> - Who would marry me?<br> - By George, Eliza.<br> Before I'm done with you, the streets<br> will be strewn with the bodies of men...<br> shooting themselves<br> for your sake.<br> He's off his chump, he is.<br> I don't want no loonies teachin' me.<br> Oh, I'm mad, am I?<br> Very well, Mrs. Pearce, throw her out!<br> - Stop.

Good night, Eliza.<br> - Good night.<br> dd<br> dd<br> Put out the lights, Eliza. And tell Mrs.<br> Pearce not to bring me coffee in the morning.<br> I'll take tea.<br> dd<br> Where on Earth<br> did I put my slippers?<br> There are your slippers!<br> And there!<br> Take your slippers! And may you<br> never have a day's luck with them!<br> What's the matter? Anything wrong?<br> No, nothing wrong with you.<br> I've won your bet for you, haven't I?<br> That's all that counts.<br> I don't matter,<br> I suppose.<br> You won my bet? You?<br> You presumptuous insect, I won it.<br> Why did you throw<br> those slippers at me?<br> Because I wanted<br> to smash your face in.<br> I'd like to kill you,<br> you brute.<br> Why didn't you leave me<br> where you found me, in the gutter?<br> You thank God it's all over and<br> that you can throw me back again there.<br> Well, well, well,<br> the creature is nervous after all.<br> Would you? Don't you dare show your<br> temper to me! Sit down and be quiet!<br> What's to become of me?<br> What's to become of me?<br> How the devil do I know? What does<br> it matter what becomes of you?<br> You don't care. I know you don't care.<br> You wouldn't care if I was dead.<br> - I'm nothing to you, not so much as them slippers.<br> - "Those" slippers.<br> Those... slippers.<br> Didn't think it made<br> any difference now.<br> - May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?<br> - No.<br> Has anyone behaved<br> badly to you?<br> - Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce, any of the servants?<br> - No.<br> I presume you don't pretend<br> that I've treated you badly.<br> - No.<br> - Ah. Well, I'm glad to hear that anyway.<br> Probably you're tired<br> after the strain of the day.<br> - Here. Have a chocolate.<br> - No!<br> - No?<br> - No! Thank you.<br> Well, it's all over now.<br> There's nothing more to worry about.<br> No.<br> Nothing more<br> for you to worry about.<br> Oh, God...<br> I wish I was dead.<br> Why?<br> In Heaven's name, why?<br> Now, listen to me, Eliza.<br> All this irritation<br> is purely subective.<br> I don't understand.<br> I'm too ignorant.<br> It's only imagination,<br> low spirits, nothing more.<br> Nobody's trying to hurt you.<br> Nothing's wrong.<br> Now, you go to bed like a good girl<br> and sleep it off.<br> Have a little cry and say your prayers<br> and... that'll make you comfortable.<br> I heard your prayers-<br> "Thank God<br> it's all over. "<br> Well, don't you thank God it's all over?<br> You're free. You can do what you like.<br> What am I fit for?<br> What have you left me fit for?<br> Where am I to go?<br> What am I to do?<br> What's to become of me?<br> Oh, so that's what's<br> worrying you, is it?<br> Oh, you'll settle down<br> somewhere or other.<br> But I hadn't<br> quite realized...<br> that you were going away.<br> You might marry, you know.<br> You're not bad-looking.<br> It's quite a pleasure<br> to look at you sometimes.<br> Of course, now you've been crying, you<br> look as ugly as the very devil, but...<br> when you're quite all right<br> and yourself,<br> you're what I<br> should call attractive.<br> That is, to people in<br> the marrying line,you understand.<br> Now, you go to bed<br> and have a good night's rest.<br> Get up in the morning and look at yourself<br> in the glass, and you won't feel so cheap.<br> I daresay my mother could find<br> some chap or other who'd do very well.<br> - We were above that in Covent Garden.<br> - What do you mean?<br> I sold flowers.<br> I didn't sell myself.<br> Now you've made a lady of me,<br> I'm not fit to sell anything else.<br> I wish you'd left me<br> where you found me.<br> But you don't have to marry the fellow<br> if you don't like him.<br> - What else am I to do?<br> - Lots of things.<br> How about your old idea of a florist<br> shop? Pickering could set you up.<br> He's got lots of money.<br> Oh, you'll be all right.<br> I must clear off to bed.<br> I'm devilish sleepy.<br> By the way, I came here for something.<br> I forget what it was.<br> Your slippers.<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> You shied them at me.<br> - Before you go, sir-<br> - Eh?<br> Do my clothes belong to me<br> or to Colonel Pickering?<br> What use should they be<br> to Pickering?<br> You might want them for the next girl<br> you pick up to experiment on.<br> Is that the way<br> you feel towards us?<br> I don't want to hear<br> any more about that.<br> All I want to know is what belongs to me<br> and what doesn't. My own clothes were burned.<br> What's it matter? Why start bothering<br> about that in the middle of the night?<br> I want to know what I<br> may take away with me.<br> - I don't want to be accused of stealing.<br> - Stealing?<br> Eliza, you shouldn't have said that.<br> That shows a want of feeling.<br> I'm sorry. I'm only a common,<br> ignorant girl.<br> And in my station,<br> I have to be careful.<br> There can't be any feelings between<br> the like of you and the like of me.<br> Will you please tell me<br> what belongs to me and what doesn't?<br> Oh, you can keep the whole<br> confounded houseful if you like.<br> All except the ewels. They're hired.<br> Will that satisfy you?<br> Stop, please. Will you take these<br> to your room and keep them safe?<br> - I don't want to run the risk<br> of them being missing.<br> Hand 'em over.<br> If these belonged to me instead of the eweler,<br> I'd ram 'em down your ungrateful throat.<br> This ring-<br> It isn't the eweler's.<br> It's the one you bought me<br> in Brighton.<br> I don't want it now.<br> - Don't you hit me!<br> - Hit you, you infamous creature?<br> How dare you accuse me of such a thing.<br> It's you who have hit me.<br> - You have wounded me to the heart.<br> - I'm glad.<br> Glad! I've got a little<br> of my own back anyhow!<br> You've caused me to lose my temper, a thing<br> that's hardly ever happened to me before.<br> I prefer to say nothing more tonight.<br> I shall go to bed.<br> You'd better leave a note<br> for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee,<br> because she won't<br> be told by me!<br> Damn Mrs. Pearce, and damn the coffee,<br> and damn you and damn my own folly...<br> in having lavished<br> hard-earned knowledge...<br> and the treasure<br> of my regard and intimacy...<br> on a heartless<br> guttersnipe!<br> Whatever are you<br> doing here?<br> Uh, uh... nothing.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I spend most of my nights here.<br> It's the only place<br> I feel really happy.<br> - Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.<br> - Don't call me Miss Doolittle.<br> Eliza's good enough<br> for me.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To the river.<br> - What for?<br> - To make a hole in it.<br> - To make a... hole in it?<br> - Freddy.<br> You don't think I'm<br> a heartless guttersnipe, do you?<br> No, darling.<br> How can you imagine such a thing?<br> I think you're the most wonderful-<br> the loveliest-<br> NoW then, noW then, noW then.<br> - This isn't Paris, you know.<br> - No. Sorry, Constable.<br> Eliza. Eliza.<br> - You let me kiss you.<br> - Well, why not? Why shouldn't someone kiss me?<br> Why shouldn't someone<br> be in love with me? Kiss me again.<br> - Kiss me again!<br> - All right.<br> Now then, you two,<br> what's this?<br> - Were you annoying that young lady?<br> - No, Constable, certainly not.<br> - Move along, then, double quick.<br> - As you say, sir.<br> Well, if it ain't-<br> Beg your pardon, Miss.<br> Buy a flower<br> off a poor girl?<br> Thank you, Miss.<br> Sir.<br> Your coffee, sir.<br> Didn't Eliza tell you<br> to bring tea?<br> She didn't wait to tell me.<br> She's gone.<br> - Gone?<br> - I said gone, and I meant it, every word of it.<br> Mrs. Pearce!<br> Where the devil's my engagement book?<br> - I don't know any of my appointments!<br> - Eliza would know.<br> - But she isn't here, damn it!<br> - Then you'd better find her, damn it!<br> What's that ass<br> of an inspector say?<br> - Have you offered a reward?<br> - Shh.! What?<br> - You can't help us find her?<br> - What are the police for, in Heaven's name?<br> I really think they<br> suspected us of some improper purpose.<br> Of course, I don't care<br> what becomes of her.<br> Where the devil<br> can she be?<br> - Have you seen Eliza Doolittle?<br> - No.<br> I say, Mother,<br> here's a confounded thing.<br> - Good morning, my dear. What is it?<br> - Eliza's bolted.<br> - Good morning, Colonel Pickering.<br> - What am I to do?<br> Do without,<br> I'm afraid, Henry.<br> The girl has a perfect right<br> to leave if she chooses.<br> - Something may have happened to her.<br> - What are we to do?<br> You've no more sense,<br> either of you, than two children.<br> You must have frightened<br> the poor girl.<br> I hardly said a word to her.<br> Did you bully her after I went to bed?<br> Exactly the other way about.<br> She threw the slippers in my face.<br> The moment I entered the room, the slippers<br> came bang in my face before I'd uttered a word.<br> - And she used the most perfectly awful language.<br> - dd<br> I can't say I'm surprised.<br> And you mean to tell me<br> that after all her hard work...<br> and after doing this wonderful thing for<br> you without making one single mistake,<br> you two sat there<br> and hardly said a word to her?<br> Well, we didn't make speeches<br> if that's what you mean.<br> You didn't thank her,<br> pet her, admire her?<br> And she only threw<br> the slippers at you.<br> I'd have thrown<br> the fire irons at you.<br> Mr. Henry, a gentleman wants<br> to see you most particular.<br> - I can't see anybody now.<br> - He's been sent down from Wimpole Street.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Mr. Doolittle, sir.<br> - dd<br> - Doolittle? A dustman?<br> Dustman? Oh, no, sir.<br> A gentleman.<br> Show him in.<br> By George, Pick, this is some<br> relative of hers she's gone to,<br> someone we know nothing about,<br> genteel relations.<br> Now we shall hear<br> something.<br> Doolittle!<br> What the dickens<br> has happened to you?<br> Henry Higgins, do you see this?<br> Look at this. You done this.<br> - Done what, man?<br> - Look at this hat. Look at this coat.<br> Good morning,<br> Mr. Doolittle. Won't you come in?<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> - What has my son done to you?<br> He's ruined me,<br> destroyed me happiness.<br> Tied me up and delivered me<br> into the hands of middle-class morality.<br> You're raving, you're drunk, you're mad.<br> I gave you five pounds.<br> After that, I had two conversations<br> with you at half a crown an hour.<br> - I've never even seen you since.<br> - Mad am I? Drunk am I?<br> Tell me this. Did you or did you not<br> write to an old blighter in America...<br> to say the most original moralist<br> at present in England...<br> was Alfred Doolittle,<br> a common garbage man?<br> What, Ezra D. Wannafeller,Jr.?<br> Oh, I remember making<br> some silly oke of the kind.<br> You might well call it<br> a silly oke.<br> I- It's put the lid on me<br> right enough.<br> Just give him the chance he was lookin'<br> for to show Americans isn't like us-<br> that they recognize and respect<br> merit in whatever class of life,<br> however humble.<br> Them words is in his bloomin' will in<br> which he leaves me 3,000 pounds a year...<br> on condition I lecture for<br> the Wannafeller Moral Reform League...<br> as often as they ask me,<br> up to six times a year.<br> This solves the problem<br> of Eliza's future.<br> You can provide<br> for her now.<br> Yes, I'm expected to provide<br> for everybody now, out of 3,000 a year.<br> He shan't provide for her. She doesn't<br> belong to him. I paid him five pounds for her.<br> - Doolittle, you're either an honest man or a rogue.<br> - Little of both.<br> - Have you found Eliza?<br> - Have you lost her?<br> - Yes!<br> - Blimey. You have all the luck, you have.<br> I ain't found her, but she'd find me<br> quick enough after what you done to her.<br> - Now, you listen to me- - Would you<br> wait here for a moment, Mr. Doolittle.<br> Henry, I have<br> a surprise for you.<br> - Do you really want to know where Eliza is?<br> - Yes. Where is she?<br> She says she's willing<br> to meet you on friendly terms,<br> and let bygones<br> be bygones.<br> Is she, by God?<br> Pickering!<br> - Where is she?<br> - Now, promise to behave yourself, Henry.<br> Good morning, Colonel Pickering.<br> Quite chilly this morning, isn't it?<br> Oh, how do you do, Professor Higgins?<br> Are you quite well?<br> But of course you are.<br> You're never ill.<br> Won't you sit down,<br> Colonel Pickering?<br> Don't you dare try<br> this game on with me.<br> Get up and come home!<br> And don't be a fool.<br> Very nicely put indeed, Henry. No Woman<br> could resist such an invitation.<br> Let her speak for herself.<br> There isn't an idea<br> that I haven't put into her head.<br> I tell you, I've created this thing<br> out of squashed cabbage leaves...<br> in Covent Garden.<br> Now she pretends to play<br> the fine lady with me.<br> Will you drop me altogether now the<br> experiment is over, Colonel Pickering?<br> You mustn't<br> think of it as an experiment.<br> Oh, I'm only<br> a "squashed cabbage" leaf.<br> But I owe so much to you that I<br> should be very unhappy if you forgot me.<br> It was from you<br> that I learned nice manners.<br> - And that's What makes one a lady, isn't it?<br> - Ha!<br> That's what makes<br> the difference, after all.<br> No doubt. Still, he taught you<br> to speak. I couldn't have done that.<br> Of course.<br> That Was his profession.<br> It Was just like... learning to dance<br> in the fashionable Way.<br> Nothing more<br> than that in it.<br> - Do you knoW What began my real education?<br> - No.<br> Your calling me<br> Miss Doolittle...<br> that day when I first came<br> to Wimpole Street.<br> That was the beginning<br> of self-respect for me.<br> You see, the difference between a lady<br> and a flower girl isn't how she behaves.<br> It's how she's treated.<br> NoW, I knoW that I shall alWays be<br> a floWer girl to Professor Higgins...<br> because he always treats me<br> as a flower girl and always will.<br> Don't grind your teeth, Henry.<br> But I know that I can be<br> a lady to you...<br> because you always treat me<br> as a lady, and always will.<br> That's very nice of you<br> to say so, Miss Doolittle.<br> I should like you to call me<br> Eliza now if you would.<br> Thank you.<br> Eliza.<br> Of course.<br> And I should like Professor Higgins<br> to call me Miss Doolittle.<br> - I'll see you damned first.<br> - Henry. Henry.<br> You're coming back,<br> aren't you? You'll forgive Higgins.<br> Forgive? Will she, by George!<br> Let her go.<br> Let her find out<br> What it's like to be Without us.<br> In three weeks, she'll relapse back<br> into the gutter without me at her elbow.<br> You won't relapse,<br> will you?<br> No, never again.<br> I don't believe I could utter<br> one of those old sounds if I tried.<br> Owww!<br> Ha, ha.! What did I tell you?<br> Victory.!<br> Victory!<br> Ow. Ow.<br> Ow, ow, ow.<br> - Henry!<br> - Ow!<br> Eliza, it ain't my fault.<br> Your stepmother-<br> Henry-<br> Look, Henry- Oh.<br> - Colonel, I'm gettin' late for the weddin'.<br> - Wedding? What wedding?<br> - Mine.<br> - Yours?<br> Yes. In spite of all<br> I've said and done, my wife-<br> she's going to marry me.<br> I'm feeling uncommon nervous<br> about the ceremony, guvnor.<br> - Wish you'd come and put me through it.<br> - You've been through it before.<br> - You were married to Eliza's mother.<br> - Who told you that, guvnor?<br> - Nobody told me, but I concluded naturally.<br> - No, no.<br> That ain't<br> the natural way, guvnor.<br> That's only<br> the middle-class way.<br> Don't tell Eliza.<br> She don't know.<br> - I always had a sort of delicacy about tellin' her.<br> - Quite right.<br> Will you come to the church<br> and see me through straight?<br> With pleasure,<br> as far as a bachelor can.<br> May I come too?<br> I'd be very sorry to miss your wedding.<br> We should indeed be honored<br> by your condescension, ma'am.<br> My poor old woman, she'd look upon it<br> as a tremend-uous compliment.<br> She's been<br> very low lately,<br> thinking of the happy days<br> that are no more.<br> Eliza? Your stepmum<br> is going to marry me.<br> Will you come to the church<br> and see me turned out?<br> I've ordered<br> the car, dear.<br> Wait for me. Colonel Pickering<br> can go with the bridegroom.<br> "Bridegroom. "<br> What a word.<br> Makes a man realize<br> his position somehow.<br> So long.<br> See you at the church.<br> Middle-class morality<br> claims its victim.<br> Eliza.<br> Well, Eliza, you've had a bit of<br> your own back now, as you call it.<br> You had enough? Are you going to be<br> reasonable? Or do you want some more?<br> You want me back<br> only to put up with your tempers...<br> and pick up your slippers<br> and fetch and carry for you.<br> - I haven't said I wanted you back at all.<br> - Then what are we talking about?<br> About you, not about me.<br> If you come back to me, I shall treat you<br> ust the same as I've always treated you.<br> I can't change my nature,<br> and I don't intend to change my manners.<br> - My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.<br> - That's not true.<br> He treats a flower girl<br> as if she were a duchess.<br> I treat a duchess as if<br> she were a flower girl!<br> I see.<br> The same to everyone.<br> I don't care<br> how you treat me.<br> I don't mind<br> your swearing at me.<br> I don't mind a black eye.<br> I've had one before this, but...<br> I won't be passed over!<br> Then get out of my way,<br> for I won't stop for you.<br> - You talk to me as if I were a bus.<br> - So you are a bus.<br> All bounce and go<br> and no consideration for anyone.<br> Once and for all, understand<br> that I go my way and do my work...<br> without caring a tuppence<br> what happens to either of us.<br> So you can come back or go<br> to the devil, whichever you please.<br> - And what am I to come back for?<br> - For the fun of it.<br> That's what<br> I took you on for.<br> And you can throw me out tomorrow if<br> I don't do everything you want me to?<br> You can walk out tomorrow<br> if I don't do everything you want me to.<br> - And live with my stepmother?<br> - Yes.<br> Or sell flowers.<br> Or would you rather marry Pickering?<br> I wouldn't marry you if you asked me,<br> and you're nearer my age then what he is.<br> Than he is.<br> I'll speak as I like.<br> You're not my teacher now.<br> I don't know that Pickering<br> would, though.<br> He's as confirmed<br> an old bachelor as I am.<br> That's not what I want,<br> and don't you think it.<br> I've always had chaps<br> wanting me that way.<br> Freddy Hill writes to me<br> twice and three times a day.<br> - Sheets and sheets.<br> - Blast his impudence!<br> He has a right to if he likes, poor lad.<br> And he does love me.<br> You have no right<br> to encourage him.<br> - Every girl has a right to be loved.<br> - By fools like that?<br> Freddy's not a fool!<br> If he's weak and poor and wants me,<br> maybe he'd make me happier<br> than my betters...<br> Who bully me<br> and don't Want me.<br> I can do without you.<br> Don't think I can't.<br> You've never asked,<br> I suppose,<br> whether I could do<br> without you.<br> You'll have to do<br> without me.<br> I can do without anybody!<br> I have my own soul,<br> my own spark of divine fire.<br> But, uh,<br> I shall miss you, Eliza.<br> I confess that humbly<br> and gratefully.<br> I've become accustomed<br> to your voice and appearance.<br> I even like them, rather.<br> Well, you have them both on your<br> gramophone and in your book of photographs.<br> When you feel lonely, you can turn the<br> machine on. It's got no feelings to hurt.<br> I can't turn<br> your soul on.<br> Oh, you're a devil.<br> You can twist the heart in a girl as easily<br> as some can twist her arms to hurt her.<br> I want a little kindness.<br> Why, I know I'm only<br> a common, ignorant girl,<br> but I'm not dirt<br> under your feet.<br> What I done, I-<br> What I did,<br> it wasn't for the dresses<br> and the taxis.<br> It was because we were pleasant<br> together and because I come-<br> Came to care for you.<br> Not forgetting<br> the difference between us...<br> and not wanting you<br> to make love to me, but-<br> Well, more-<br> more friendly like.<br> Of course, Eliza.<br> That's exactly how I feel.<br> And how Pickering feels.<br> - Eliza, you're a fool.<br> - That's not a proper answer to give me.<br> If you can't stand the coldness<br> of my sort of life...<br> and the strain of it,<br> go back to the gutter.<br> It's a fine life,<br> the life of the gutter.<br> It's real, it's warm,<br> it's violent.<br> Not like science, literature<br> and classical music...<br> and philosophy and art.<br> You find me cold, unfeeling,<br> selfish, don't you?<br> Very well. Then marry some<br> sentimental hog or other...<br> with a thick pair of lips<br> to kiss you with...<br> and a thick pair of boots<br> to kick you with.<br> If you can't appreciate what you've got,<br> you better get what you can appreciate.<br> - I won't care for anyone who doesn't care for me.<br> - Oh, Eliza, you're an idiot!<br> I waste the treasures of my Miltonic<br> mind by spreading them before you.<br> Oh, I can't talk to you.<br> You turn everything against me.<br> You know very well that I can't<br> go back to the gutter, as you call it,<br> and that I have no real friends<br> in the world but you and the Colonel.<br> You think I must go back to Wimpole Street<br> because I have nowhere to go but Father's.<br> But don't be too sure that you have me under<br> your feet to be bullied and talked down.<br> I'll marry Freddy, I will,<br> as soon as I'm able to support him!<br> What, that young fool?<br> You shall marry an ambassador.<br> You shall marry<br> the viceroy of India.<br> I won't have my masterpiece<br> thrown away on Freddy.<br> You think I like you to say that, but I<br> haven't forgotten what you said a minute ago.<br> If I can't have kindness,<br> I'll have independence.<br> Independence-<br> that's middle-class blasphemy.<br> We're all of us dependent on<br> one another, every soul on Earth.<br> I'll let you see<br> whether I'm dependent on you.<br> If you can preach, I can teach.<br> I'll go and be a teacher.<br> Ha! What'll you teach,<br> in Heaven's name?<br> What you taught me.<br> I'll teach phonetics.<br> I'll offer myself as an assistant<br> to Professor Karpathy.<br> What, that humbug? That impostor?<br> That toadying ignoramus?<br> You take one step in his direction,<br> and I'll wring your neck, you hear?<br> Wring away! What do I care?<br> I knew you'd strike me one day.<br> - Oh!<br> - Now I know how to deal with you.<br> Oh, what a fool I was<br> not to think of it before.<br> That's done you,<br> 'Enry 'Iggins, it has.<br> And I don't give that<br> for your bullying and your fine talk.<br> When I think of myself...<br> crawling under your feet...<br> and being trampled on<br> and talked down,<br> when all the time I had only to<br> lift my finger to be as good as you are,<br> oh, I could ust<br> kick myself.<br> By George, Eliza, I said I'd make<br> a woman of you, and I have.<br> I like you like this.<br> Yes, you make up to me now that I'm not<br> afraid of you and I can do without you.<br> Of course I do,<br> you little fool.<br> Five minutes ago,<br> you were a millstone around my neck.<br> Now you're a tower of strength,<br> a consort battleship.<br> Good-bye,<br> Professor Higgins.<br> OW, I ain't dirty.!<br> I Washed my face and hands<br> before I come, I did.<br> I shall make a duchess of<br> this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.<br> - Ohhh.!<br> - In six months, in three-<br> I Washed my face and hands<br> before I came.<br> I did.<br> Where the devil<br> are my slippers, Eliza?<br>
