Very good.<br> Dr. Royer-Collard,|welcome to Charenton.<br> This may feel|a little awkward, my friend,<br> but it needn't be.<br> I've come merely|to oversee your work here.|Understood ?<br> - Of course.|- It's a formality. Truly.<br> Well, you're a man of science,|and I'm a man of God.<br> Charenton stands to profit|from us both, I'm certain.<br> I shall need an office on the grounds,|somewhere to store my things.<br> - This way.|- If you don't mind my asking,<br> why has the emperor taken|such sudden interest in my-<br> in our affairs ?<br> It seems a particular|patient of yours...|has captured his fancy.<br> I understand|he practices the very crimes|he preaches in his fiction.<br> Certainly not here.<br> - There were a few|indiscretions in his youth.|- "Indiscretions" ?<br> Abbe, please,|I have read his case history.<br> At 1 6, he violated|a servant girl with a crucifix.<br> After six months in a dungeon,|he mutilated a prostitute,<br> carving her flesh with a razor|and cauterizing the wounds|with hot wax.<br> I hope you'll judge him|by his progress here,<br> - No !|- not his past reputation.<br> I can't go on like this.|Why should this be happening to me ?<br> Once again, gentlemen.<br> I'm just a lowly cobbler.<br> I have been all my life.<br> And with this shoe,|I'm asking you to be a cobbler's wife.<br> It's a dreadful play,|a festering pustule|on the face of literature.<br> Why, the parchment it's written upon|isn't worthy to wipe my ass.<br> But you need not make it worse.|Say your lines with conviction,|my happy little shoemaker.<br> - Like a true actor.|- But I'm not an actor.|I'm a dyspeptic.<br> Just seduce her,|you goon !<br> He's actually made a great success|of our little theater.<br> There's seldom an empty seat,|not to mention its therapeutic value.<br> Playing dress-up|with cretins...<br> sounds like a symptom|of madness, not a cure.<br> Homo perversio:|a species that thrives in captivity.<br> Marquis, this is Dr. Royer-Collard.|He's joining us here in-<br> An advisory capacity.<br> Welcome to our humble|madhouse, Doctor.<br> I trust you'll|find yourself at home.<br> There he is, the new doctor.<br> Tell me, Abbe, why is he in your care|and not a proper prison ?<br> - His wife's influence.|- " His wife's" ?<br> Better to have an insane spouse|than a criminal one.<br> And he has never once|tried to escape ?<br> A man of his notoriety ?|He wouldn't last a day|on the streets without capture.<br> Besides, every wholesome thing|he might desire, he has at Charenton:;<br> a library filled|with the world's great books,<br> music lessons,|watercolor exercises.<br> What effect have all these amenities|had on his psyche ?<br> He no longer roars|or spits.<br> He no longer taunts the guards|or molests his fellow wards.<br> And his writing ?<br> - Ah, yes, that.|- Well ?<br> It's essential to his recovery,|a purgative for the toxins in his mind.<br> Do you favor|its publication ?<br> - For sale ? To the general public ?|- Yes. Yes.<br> No, certainly not.|It's unprintable.<br> All France is aghast at this book,|yet you've never heard of it.<br> Oh, dear God.<br> Silence the marquis,|or Charenton will be shut down|by order of the emperor.<br> "Shut down" ? But he's one|among some 200 wards.<br> You could try|my calming chair on him.<br> Or, perhaps,|try bleeding him with leeches.<br> Or maybe flog him|at the stake.<br> Why ? So he'll learn|to fear punishment...<br> rather than to see virtue|for its own rewards ?<br> Doctor, let me take up this matter|with the marquis myself.<br> - Chariton's my life's work.|- I am not without a heart.<br> But this book is a profound insult|to decent people everywhere.<br> Can you personally guarantee|this won't happen again ?<br> You have my word.<br> - What is it, Abbe ?|- The marquis has embarrassed us.<br> - From Napoleon himself.|- Why ? What's he done ?<br> He's been slipping manuscripts|to a publisher.<br> - He has ?<br> I placed my trust|too carelessly, Madeleine.<br> - This is a complete and utter...|- Oh.<br> disappointment.<br> Yes, it is.<br> The paper's cheap.|The type's too small.<br> What did you do,|bribe one of the guards ?<br> But you implored me to write|for curative purposes,|to stave off my madness.<br> But you've no right|to publish...<br> behind my back|without my sanction.<br> Have you truly read it,|or did you run straightaway|to the dog-eared pages ?<br> Oh, enough to discern|its tenor.<br> And ?<br> It's not even a proper novel.<br> It's nothing but an encyclopedia|of perversions.<br> Frankly, it even fails|as an exercise in craft.<br> Characters are wooden.|The dialogue is inane.<br> Not to mention the endless repetition|of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff."<br> There I was taxed,|it's true.<br> And such puny scope.<br> Nothing but the very worst|in man's nature.<br> I write of the great|eternal truths...<br> that bind together all mankind|the whole world over.<br> We eat, we shit, we fuck,|we kill and we die.<br> But we also fall in love.<br> We build cities,|we compose symphonies|and we endure.<br> Why not put that|in your books as well ?<br> It's a fiction,|not a moral treatise.<br> But isn't the duty of art|to elevate us above the beasts ?<br> I'd have thought that was|your duty, Abbe, not mine.<br> One more trick like this...<br> and I'll be forced|to revoke all your liberties.<br> It's that doctor fellow,|isn't it ?<br> He's come to usurp|your place here, hasn't he ?<br> Marquis, more than|your writing's at stake.<br> The ministry has threatened us|with closure.<br> Ah, they can't be serious !<br> Our future lies|in the stroke of your pen.<br> Mightier than the sword,|indeed.<br> Put yourself in my place. I have|your fellow patients to consider.<br> If Charenton folds, they have|no place to go, no manner|to clothe or feed themselves.<br> Fuck them !
