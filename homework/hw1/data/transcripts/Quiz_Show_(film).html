Enright's the key here.<br> The key to what ? The jury<br> hears the public. The public<br> doesn't know Dan Enright.<br> The purpose is not to reform<br> the souls of the contestants.<br> The purpose is to reform TV.<br> - lt's like the Barenblatt<br> and the Sweezey cases.<br> - You don't wanna call him.<br> Fine, Dick. Just don't patronize me<br> with your legal bullshit.<br> - She's got a point, Dick.<br> - Bob, maybe it's time<br> for you to go home.<br> How'd you like Dick's steak<br> done, Bob ?

NBC is gonna<br> go on. Geritol's gonna go on.<br> Makes me wonder what you hope<br> to accomplish with all this.<br> Don't worry.<br> l'm just gettin' started.<br> Even the quiz shows'll be back.<br> Why fix them ?<br> Think about it. You could do<br> exactly the same thing by just<br> making the questions easier.<br> The audience didn't tune in<br> to watch some amazing display<br> of intellectual ability.<br> They just wanted<br> to watch the money.<br> lmagine if they could<br> watch you.<br> You're a bright young kid with a bright<br> future.

Did you<br> read Norman Mailer in Dissent ?<br> - l only glanced at it.<br> Everyone's talking about it. They don't<br> know whether he's a genius or a fool.<br> Have you heard there's this<br> congressional committee that's, um--<br> Well, they're investigating<br> the quiz shows.<br> l read that.<br> What's it about ?<br> Well, evidently,<br> certain of the contestants were<br> given the answers in advance.<br> Cheating on a quiz show. That's like<br> plagiarizing a comic strip.<br> Well, at any rate, it seems<br> the committee wants to call me<br> to, to testify.<br> Oh, l've testified before.<br> Funding for the arts. lt's nothing.<br> - l think this is a little different.<br> - You'll run circles round them.<br> lt's not exactly Jefferson<br> and Lincoln down there anymore.<br> l think this is<br> a little different.<br> l'd think you'd be glad<br> at a chance to clear your name.<br> Otherwise, people<br> might believe--<br> People will believe whatever they<br> want to believe. That's not the issue.<br> Just tell 'em the truth.<br> You'll do fine.<br> The real issue, Charlie,<br> is how this keeps distracting<br> you from your teaching.<br> This and that program in the morning,<br> though you insist that it doesn't.<br> Dad, l can't simply just<br> tell 'em the truth.<br> Can't tell them<br> the truth ?<br> Why on earth not ?<br> lt's, it's complicated.<br> Complicated ?<br> [ Sighs ] Yeah, l can't.<br> l ca--<br> Charlie, from what l understand,<br> it's just this bunch of frauds...<br> showing off an erudition<br> they didn't really have.<br> - All you have to do--<br> - The problem is...<br> is it seems<br> l was one of those frauds.<br> What ?<br> What--<br> What do you mean ?<br> They gave me the answers.<br> They gave you the answers.<br> They gave you the answers !<br> Well-- No, no.<br> At first, they asked me questions they<br> already knew l knew the answers to.<br> We ran through those, and l still<br> didn't want them to give me the answers,<br> so l had them give me questions<br> and l'd go look up the answers,<br> as if that were any different.<br> We ran through those<br> in a couple of weeks.<br> Then l just didn't have the time.<br> Finally, it just seemed silly.<br> They gave you all that money to answer<br> questions they knew you knew ?<br> - Now, that's inflation !<br> - You're not being very helpful.<br> l'm sorry, Charlie. l'm<br> an old man. lt's all a little<br> difficult for me to comprehend.<br> lt's television, Dad !<br> lt's, it's just television.<br> You make it sound like<br> you didn't have a choice.<br> What was l supposed to do<br> at that point ? Disillusion<br> the whole goddamn country ?<br> - You took the money !<br> - Yes, l know ! l took the money.<br> - ls that what this was about ?<br> - No. No. l don't know.<br> lt was a goddamned<br> quiz show, Charlie.<br> - ''An ill-favored thing, sir.<br> - This is not the time to play games.<br> - But mine own.'' lt was mine.<br> - Your name is mine.<br> Charlie.<br> l'm sorry.<br> l'm really sorry, Dad.<br> You'll be, um...<br> dragged into all this,<br> you and Mother.<br> Oh, my God, Charlie.<br> How are you gonna tell<br> that committee ?<br> Will you come down there<br> with me ?<br> [ Chairman ] The, uh, subcommittee<br> calls Charles Van Doren.<br> [ Crowd Chattering ]<br> [ Reporters Firing Questions ]<br> - [ Gavel Pounding ]<br> - Photographers will please<br> clear the room.<br> - Will you please state your name ?<br> - Charles Van Doren.<br> - l've gotta get in there.<br> l've gotta get in there.<br> - Excuse me, sir.<br> Wait a minute !<br> Hey, you, come back here !<br> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony<br> you are about to give will be the truth,<br> - the whole truth and nothing but<br> the truth, so help you God ?<br> - l do.<br> Now, we are advised<br> that you have...<br> a prepared statement that you would<br> prefer to give at the outset ?<br> - Yes, sir.

They're not always<br> what they appear to be.<br> l was involved,<br> deeply involved,<br> in a deception.<br> l have deceived my friends.<br> And l had millions of them.<br> l lied to<br> the American people.<br> l lied about what l knew, and then<br> l lied about what l did not know.<br> ln a sense, l was like a child<br> who refuses to admit a fact<br> in the hope that it'll go away.<br> Of course<br> it did not go away.<br> l was scared,<br> scared to death.<br> l had no solid position.<br> No basis to stand on<br> for myself.<br> There was one way out and that was...<br> simply to tell the truth.<br> lt may sound trite to you,<br> but l've found myself again<br> after a number of years.<br> l've been acting a role,<br> maybe all my life,<br> of thinking l've done more,<br> accomplished more,<br> produced more than l have.<br> l have had all the breaks.<br> l have stood on the shoulders<br> of life, and l've never gotten<br> down into the dirt to build,<br> to erect a foundation<br> of my own.<br> l have flown too high<br> on borrowed wings.<br> Everything came too easy.<br> That is why l am here today.<br> [ Chairman ] Mr. Van Doren,<br> l want to compliment you<br> for that statement.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Uh, Mr. Van Doren, l would like to join<br> the Chairman in commending you...<br> for the soul-searching fortitude<br> displayed in your statement.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - [ Rogers ] Mr. Van Doren,<br> l just wanna add<br> my kudos.<br> l have listened to many<br> witnesses, in both civil...<br> and criminal matters,<br> and yours is the most<br> soul-searching confession l<br> think l've heard in a long time.<br> [ Van Doren ] Thank you, sir.<br> [ Congressman ] Mr. Van Doren,<br> l'm also from New York;<br> a different part of New York.<br> l'm happy that you've made the<br> statement, but l cannot agree<br> with most of my colleagues.<br> You see, l don't think an adult of your<br> intelligence ought to be commended...<br> for simply at long last<br> telling the truth.<br> [ Scattered Applause ]<br> [ Gavel Pounding ]<br> [ Gavel Pounding ]<br> lf the committee has nothing to add,<br> Mr. Van Doren, you are dismissed.<br> - [ Reporters Chattering ]<br> - Charlie !
