                        This is the Appian Way...<br> ...the most famous road<br> that leads to Rome...<br> ...as all roads lead to Rome.<br> On this road march<br> her conquering legions.<br> Imperial Rome is<br> the center of the empire...<br> ...and undisputed master of the world.<br> But with this power<br> inevitably comes corruption.<br> No man is sure of his life.<br> The individual is at the mercy<br> of the state.<br> Murder replaces justice.<br> Rulers of conquered nations surrender<br> their helpless subjects to bondage.<br> High and low alike<br> become Roman slaves...<br> ...Roman hostages.<br> There is no escape<br> from the whip and the sword.<br> That any force on earth<br> can shake the foundations...<br> ...of this pyramid<br> of power and corruption...<br> ...of human misery and slavery,<br> seems inconceivable.<br> But 30 years before this day,<br> a miracle occurred.<br> On a Roman cross in Judea,<br> a man died to make men free...<br> ...to spread the gospel<br> of love and redemption.<br> Soon that humble cross is destined<br> to replace the proud eagles...<br> ...that now top<br> the victorious Roman standards.<br> This is the story<br> of that immortal conflict.<br> In this, the early summer<br> in the year 64 A. D...<br> ...in the reign of the Antichrist<br> known to history as the Emperor Nero...<br> ...the victorious 14th Legion<br> is on its way back to Rome...<br> ...under the command<br> of one Marcus Vinicius.<br> We can see Rome<br> from the top of the hill.<br> Well, there it stands. Rome.<br> Three years is a long time, eh, Fabius?<br> Yes, Marcus, a long time.<br> Drusilla and the children.<br> Tonight I sleep at home.<br> Man of the family to the bitter end.<br> It's not sleep I'll be looking for.<br> It seems we've been given an escort.<br> The least they could do.<br> Hail, in the name of the divine Nero,<br> prince emperor and supreme pontiff.<br> Hail.<br> Captain Flavius,<br> Praetorian Guard, salutes you.<br> The news of your brilliant victories<br> has preceded you to Rome.<br> We're rather anxious to be there.<br> Lead us in.<br> I'm sorry, commander. I have orders.<br> Imperial orders.<br> By the body of...<br> A fine welcome<br> after a three-year campaign.<br> We're ordered to pull up and camp here<br> until notified to enter.<br> What for? How many days' wait?<br> I know nothing but the orders.<br> Rome loves her brave warriors.<br> Give that man 10 lashes.<br> Fall out!<br> And double it for any more complaints.<br> Make camp here. Out of the way.<br> - Where to, Marcus?<br> - To the palace, where else?<br> Out of the way!<br> Commander Marcus Vinicius.<br> I request an audience with the emperor.<br> I will report immediately, commander.<br> Commander, sir,<br> if I might presume, sir...<br> ...there's been much discussion<br> of your unsurpassed victories.<br> - Did you fight the Britons with a mass...?<br> - We fought with our bowels.<br> - Try it sometime.<br> - Yes, commander.<br> Yes, well, now you have it<br> as I composed it.<br> Now, from the beginning.<br> O lambent flames<br> O force divine<br> O omnivorous powers, hail<br> "Omnivorous. "<br> Omnipotent.<br> Yes.<br> Omnipotent power, hail<br> Seneca, don't you think<br> omnipotent is better?<br> Far better, Divinity.<br> There's no conviction in your voice.<br> You disturb me.<br> Petronius, you're my arbiter of elegance.<br> Which is it?<br> I find omnipotent most feeble, Divinity.<br> In fact, puerile.<br> Puerile? Feeble?<br> Omnivorous has<br> your pure, inspired imagery in it.<br> It is vivid, comprehensive.<br> A genius, Divinity,<br> should hold to his first thoughts...<br> ...on any subject.<br> Petronius. Dear Petronius.<br> What would I do<br> without your clear insight into...?<br> You clumsy toad!<br> Isn't the inner agony of my creating<br> enough without you carving me to bits?<br> Take her away.<br> Oh, where was I? What now?<br> Commander Marcus Vinicius.<br> He wishes an immediate audience.<br> Marcus, here?<br> Vinicius? Who is Marcus Vinicius?<br> My nephew. Just returned<br> with his legions from Britain.<br> Oh, yes. Bid him enter.<br> There seems to be<br> a disregard for orders here.<br> You sent word to Vinicius<br> to remain outside the city.<br> So I did. That's true, Tigellinus.<br> Does this nephew of yours consider...<br> ...that his conquests give him<br> a right to override...?<br> I cannot believe that he entered with his<br> army, Divinity, knowing Marcus as I do.<br> Doubtless he has come<br> to make obeisance and pay homage...<br> ...to his emperor and his god in private.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> I fear that a natural humility<br> often blinds me.<br> Yes.<br> Hail Nero, emperor.<br> Commander, hail. Come forward.<br> Your proud uncle has been explaining<br> the impetuosity of your devotion to me.<br> It's a joy to be such an inspiration<br> to my commanders.<br> My loyalty and my life always, Caesar.<br> My men have been away a long time.<br> They have fought and died<br> for their emperor.<br> They have gladly accepted<br> weeks of forced marches to reach home.<br> They're anxious to see their families,<br> their women.<br> Just as you said, Petronius.<br> Such loyalty, such devotion.<br> You see, the delay<br> in my men reaching their homes...<br> ...it's a question of morale.<br> Didn't you explain in...?<br> Maybe good Tigellinus<br> left the reason out of his orders.<br> - An oversight...<br> - Reasons are not given in imperial orders.<br> Oh, Tigellinus, how boorish.<br> How ungrateful.<br> We desire that you wait<br> until you are joined...<br> ...by the legions from Africa and Asia,<br> which should be a matter of hours.<br> Tomorrow you will enter Rome<br> in triumph.<br> More and more the people<br> need diversion these...<br> Or rather, shall we say<br> that this too is a question of morale?<br> They demand a spectacle.<br> A look at heroes.<br> Bear with me in this, dear commander.<br> - It is now clear to me, emperor.<br> - Divinity, may I retire with my nephew?<br> We have much to talk over.<br> Naturally.<br> I shall expect you at the feast<br> after the triumph, Vinicius.<br> We shall try to make it diverting.<br> An added honor, emperor.<br> Now, again.<br> No arms missing? No legs?<br> No. I picked up a good healthy slash<br> in the side here.<br> - You seem to be faring well, uncle.<br> - Oh, indestructible.<br> You're gonna spend time with me<br> before rushing to your estates in Sicily?<br> I intend a full month's relaxation<br> in Rome.<br> And as I remember,<br> your house is the best place for it.<br> Marcus, I've recently purchased<br> several new delectable slaves.<br> There's one from Spain. Skin like cream.<br> Hair with the sheen of a young raven.<br> She's yours.<br> - I might stay two months.<br> - Hmm.<br> Tonight I've arranged for you<br> to stay at Plautius' country place.<br> It's near your camp.<br> Aulus Plautius, the old retired general?<br> That's a gloomy outlook.<br> I know. And his wife's not young either,<br> besides being virtuous.<br> Still, it's better quarters than a tent.<br> Body of Bacchus,<br> I've been listening to that since noon.<br> He seems in rare voice.<br> Is it true what I heard while I was gone,<br> that he murdered his wife and mother?<br> My dear boy, you must learn<br> the language of privileged government.<br> Let us rather say that poor Agrippina<br> and Octavia were removed...<br> ...for the good of the empire.<br> The new wife, Poppaea,<br> sounds interesting.<br> A harlot for an empress.<br> My dear commander,<br> what a proletarian observation.<br> You must realize that a woman has<br> no past when she mates with a god.<br> Well, he's our emperor.<br> There are some in the senate<br> who are not so pleased with him.<br> They would like to replace Nero<br> with General Galba.<br> I know nothing of politics.<br> Just as long as there's money<br> to pay the army...<br> ...Rome will stand forever,<br> that I'm sure of.<br> I bid you welcome, Marcus Vinicius.<br> I salute the general.<br> We traveled the splendid roads you built<br> in Britain and Gaul.<br> My wife, the Lady Pomponia.<br> Our house is honored<br> to have you as guest.<br> My tribune, Fabius Nerva.<br> These young men<br> must wish to wash and change.<br> The baths are ready.<br> Will you show them, my dear?<br> This way, commander.<br> Dinner is at the 9th hour.<br> You're expecting other guests<br> this evening, general?<br> We're not intruding<br> on any festivities, I hope.<br> Oh, no. We live a quiet life here.<br> "Oh, no. We live a quiet life here. "<br> Here we are, transforming ourselves<br> into sweet-smelling flowers...<br> ...only to bloom in a hay field.<br> - Ha-ha.<br> You know, Marcus,<br> Drusilla last sent word...<br> ...that the oldest boy<br> is almost as tall as she is now.<br> When I left,<br> I carried him around on my shoulder.<br> That little slave from Spain<br> Petronius told me about...<br> ...I'll let her sit on mine.<br> Speaking of things that grow,<br> cast your eye on this one.<br> For your bath.<br> Stand up, fellow.<br> Body of... What a prospect.<br> What's going on in the arena these days?<br> Is Croton still champion?<br> I do not know.<br> General Plautius never thought<br> of having you trained as a gladiator?<br> He'd win enough gold<br> to fill your sandals.<br> I do not fight.<br> You don't fight?<br> Why, with one arm strapped,<br> you could kill 50 Nubians an hour.<br> I'll speak to your master about you.<br> I can make you a champion.<br> It is a sin to kill.<br> Half-witted.<br> Grew so fast,<br> his brain hit the top of the stable.<br> Behold, she stands<br> with her gown hung loose.<br> Framed is her face in golden tresses...<br> ...reflecting the milk-white beauty<br> of her shoulders.<br> So it was that Venus stood before Mars,<br> welcoming her lover.<br> Nothing do I see that is not perfection.<br> You're in service to this household,<br> I take it?<br> Very much so.<br> - Your name?<br> - Lygia.<br> Lygia. Lygia, you're a windfall.<br> I shall sacrifice a dozen white doves<br> to Venus to commemorate our meeting.<br> Your sacrifice<br> will be in vain, commander.<br> By the gods, the old general<br> must know a good slave market.<br> Not only beauty, but spirit as well.<br> There are no slaves in this household.<br> The old general, as you call him...<br> ...well, I have the honor<br> and the joy to be his daughter.<br> I crave your pardon.<br> Three years in the field<br> have dulled my perceptions.<br> Truly, I'm sorry, Lygia.<br> Will you forgive me?<br> You've done nothing<br> to ask forgiveness for.<br> For a long time,<br> the only women I've seen or known...<br> ...have been poor, dull barbarians,<br> very uninspiring.<br> Barbarians?<br> I've heard the women of Britain and Gaul<br> are most beautiful.<br> Lygia, I'm forced to tell you...<br> ...that the women of Britain<br> cover themselves with deer fat.<br> I'd say that was<br> an understandable desire to be warm.<br> The warmth is not transferable,<br> I assure you. Only in its aroma.<br> And as for the women of Gaul...<br> ...well, their hair is like<br> the frazzled ends of rope.<br> Not a soft, red-gold crown<br> with stars in it.<br> And their palm was<br> the hide of a wild boar.<br> - Not like this soft...<br> - At least that proves they are diligent.<br> Yes, at building mud huts.<br> But not in bringing<br> a man's thoughts to life.<br> I'm not sorry at all.<br> - Sorry?<br> - That Petronius arranged my stay here.<br> If things go as fate surely meant,<br> the man should be decorated.<br> If you will excuse me,<br> I must decorate the table.<br> And so you see, sir,<br> you can understand my problem.<br> We were outnumbered at least...<br> - Well, wouldn't you say three to one?<br> - Easily.<br> I drew up the spearmen in a formation<br> much like the Macedonian phalanx.<br> Let me tell you, your barbarous Briton...<br> ...is as worthy an opponent<br> as I've ever engaged.<br> They impaled themselves on the<br> spearheads like meat to the spit.<br> We were standing ankle deep<br> in their blood.<br> Can you understand the strategy, Lygia?<br> Can you see it?<br> I can only see the awful necessity<br> of defending one's home.<br> Defending?<br> They were in revolt against Rome.<br> But as I say, I credit courage.<br> A general's daughter can understand it<br> gives no pleasure to overcome weaklings.<br> The battle loses its zest.<br> Right, general?<br> - I find I've outgrown that zest.<br> - Don't be modest, general.<br> Look here, you don't seem to be excited<br> by the glorious exploits of your legions.<br> That's an odd attitude<br> for a woman of Rome.<br> I am not a Roman, I am a Lygian.<br> A Lygian? I thought, uh...<br> She's our adopted daughter.<br> Oh, I see. Lygian, Lygia.<br> She was named Callina,<br> but she prefers to be called Lygia.<br> As a child, she was taken prisoner<br> during my campaign in Lygia.<br> - A slave, then.<br> - No, no. Her father was king of Lygia.<br> She was assigned to me as a hostage.<br> We've tried to erase the wrong done her<br> with the love we have for her.<br> You should envy me such love,<br> commander.<br> Lygia, I envy the roof that covers you.<br> This one or any future.<br> May a traveler interrupt<br> with his greetings?<br> Paul.<br> Paul, you're here.<br> We've been counting the days.<br> - Pomponia. Lygia, dear.<br> One need not pray that peace be with<br> this house. It's written in your faces.<br> Paul, our two guests.<br> Tribune Fabius Nerva<br> and Commander Marcus Vinicius.<br> You must have seen their army<br> camped along the road.<br> Ah, yes.<br> - Gentlemen, our friend Paul of Tarsus.<br> - Our very dear friend.<br> - You mustn't let me interrupt your meal.<br> - We've done with it.<br> Come, let's sit in here.<br> Commander?<br> You must be tired, Paul.<br> Will you have food? A cup of wine?<br> No, thank you, my dear.<br> I supped along the way.<br> And the rigors of travel<br> always fall away rapidly here.<br> I take it, like us, you've just returned<br> from a journey.<br> Oh, yes. Antioch, Corinth.<br> Oh.<br> - You're Greek.<br> - No, I'm a Jew.<br> A citizen of Rome,<br> though I was born in Tarsus.<br> Oh, yes, Tarsus. North of Palestine.<br> That's correct.<br> You come from a troublesome<br> part of the world.<br> Much unrest down there in the past.<br> - You're a merchant of some sort?<br> - No, I'm a rabbi.<br> Well, I'm just a heavy-skulled soldier.<br> What in the name of Jupiter is a rabbi?<br> - I...<br> Paul is a teacher.<br> Oh, what do you teach?<br> He teaches...<br> - He teaches philosophy.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I suppose you'd call it that.<br> Did you know that all this time,<br> I've been teaching you philosophy?<br> I don't know<br> a great deal about philosophy.<br> And lovely women shouldn't have the time<br> to think that deeply.<br> As for me, Lygia, would you ever think<br> that I was fond of flowers?<br> I should like to see the garden.<br> You have the evening tour of the camp<br> to make, commander.<br> You must see to the disposition<br> of the men.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> I shall be back early.<br> In time for the flowers, I hope.<br> And now tell us the things<br> we've been waiting to hear.<br> - Did you see Peter?<br> - Yes, how is our big fisherman?<br> I missed him all along the way.<br> Wherever I went,<br> Peter had been there before me.<br> At Antioch,<br> they said he'd gone on to Jerusalem.<br> Others said that he'd set out<br> for Persia and the East.<br> Finally, in Corinth,<br> I learned he was on his way here...<br> ...and that he would come to us<br> any day now.<br> Peter? In Rome? Magnificent.<br> All of us.<br> To be able to speak with a man<br> who talked with Christ, our Lord.<br> I saw results of seeds Peter has planted.<br> Green shoots are sprouting.<br> There will be a good harvest.<br> Everywhere, strangers approached<br> and drew the sign of the fish before me.<br> And we spoke of the great work ahead.<br> The work is difficult<br> and dangerous now, Paul.<br> Ever since you were tried here,<br> even though you were acquitted...<br> ...Christians<br> are under constant suspicion.<br> I noticed you seemed worried<br> in the presence of your two guests.<br> Believe me,<br> I would have exercised caution.<br> Though at times, I admit the desire<br> to cry the message aloud.<br> But I suppose tactics must be applied<br> even in the spreading of love and faith.<br> Be patient, Paul. Your time will come.<br> Those two vital young men, for instance.<br> They are Rome.<br> If we could teach them,<br> we could teach the world.<br> Marcus Vinicius?<br> You are asking for miracles.<br> I am.<br> I am, indeed.<br> There is still nothing I see<br> that is not perfection.<br> However, if you're thinking of me,<br> as you undoubtedly were...<br> ...do I look that much like a fish?<br> Oh.<br> It wasn't anything to do with you.<br> You're too lovely<br> to be a lonely artist, Lygia.<br> But then, I did ask you to wait up for me.<br> - It was merely that I couldn't sleep.<br> - Nor can I.<br> I'll tell you what, Lygia.<br> The night's still young.<br> This place is unworthy of our first<br> meeting. Let's go to Petronius' house.<br> There will be gaiety there<br> you've never dreamed of.<br> Dancers, musicians, singers.<br> The best in Rome.<br> My uncle's house was built<br> by the goddess of love herself.<br> No. No, it's too late, I...<br> I mean, it's impossible.<br> Well, we could plan it<br> more discreetly, perhaps.<br> What about tomorrow?<br> You'll come see my triumph, won't you?<br> Tomorrow, there will be<br> a feast to tempt all the gods.<br> No. No, I don't wish<br> to watch your triumph.<br> I must go in now.<br> Good night, commander.<br> Tell me.<br> - What is it?<br> - What?<br> What is it you see that you don't like?<br> I'd be lying if I said I wasn't attracted<br> by what I see, Marcus Vinicius.<br> - Well, then...<br> - It's what I hear I don't like.<br> You see, a man's fame<br> always brings him fresh enemies.<br> - Who's been telling you stories about me?<br> - You have, from your own lips.<br> Ugly stories<br> of conquests and bloodshed.<br> Conquest? But what's conquest?<br> Only method of uniting<br> and civilizing the world under one power.<br> - Have to spill a little blood to do it.<br> - No.<br> There's a gentler<br> and more powerful way of doing that.<br> Without bloodshed and war.<br> Without slaves and captives bound<br> in chains to your triumphal chariots.<br> There will always be slaves.<br> Who will do the work?<br> Paul speaks of a world<br> where there would be no slaves.<br> That beggar-faced philosopher...<br> ...shouldn't be stuffing your<br> luscious little head with such nonsense.<br> How could I expect you to understand?<br> I wish you were a slave,<br> as I first thought.<br> I'd offer a price for you.<br> King's ransom for a king's daughter.<br> And taken me to your estates in Sicily<br> with all the others?<br> On a special ship.<br> What a way for a conqueror<br> to win a woman.<br> To buy her like an unresisting beast.<br> What false security you must have<br> in your heart and soul.<br> In your manhood, Marcus Vinicius.<br> What hidden scorn<br> you must have for yourself.<br> You're forgetting<br> you're a hostage of Rome, aren't you?<br> Here, you, hostage, come back here.<br> - No, commander.<br> - Out of my way.<br> I guard her, commander.<br> By whose orders? Who are you?<br> I am Ursus.<br> I guarded the king, her father.<br> I guard her now.<br> Guard her well, my gray-haired colossus.<br> Guard her well.<br> Romance seems to have been<br> short-lived.<br> There's always a weapon<br> to bring down a flighty dove, my friend.<br> And please, dear Lord,<br> forgive me my anger and my spite.<br> I do not know what came over me.<br> It was temptation, perhaps.<br> A selfish desire<br> that this man might see your light.<br> For my sake rather than for his.<br> And yet I pray that one day,<br> he shall feel the joy of your love.<br> I pray with all my heart.<br> Captain, what's the delay here?<br> The emperor has not yet appeared<br> on the balcony.<br> You will hear the trumpets, commander.<br> Gods of Rome.<br> Mighty.<br> Eternal.<br> Beneath whose auspices,<br> Rome rules the world.<br> Hear us.<br> We worship you.<br> We worship you.<br> Venus...<br> ...goddess of love.<br> We worship.<br> Mars, god of war.<br> We worship.<br> Juno, goddess of heaven.<br> We worship.<br> Jupiter, father of the gods.<br> We worship.<br> And Nero, his divine son.<br> They are impatient, Divinity.<br> They hunger to see you.<br> They're impatient?<br> What about my patience?<br> Oho. A triumph to divert them?<br> Who diverts me?<br> I slave, I agonize for them.<br> I have no privacy.<br> You are the sun in their heavens.<br> Does the sun have privacy?<br> The sun has the night.<br> They expect me to shine daily, hourly.<br> And for whom? For the people.<br> For that foul-smelling rabble.<br> It's so hot today.<br> This heat of Rome oppresses me.<br> It stifles me.<br> They demand too much.<br> I tell you, this mob, this mob tortures me.<br> I hate it second only to Rome itself.<br> The foul breath of that mob<br> floats in my house.<br> In my garden.<br> I wish...<br> Oh, I wish...<br> Your wish, Caesar.<br> Tell me, that I may execute it.<br> I wish it had but a single throat,<br> that mob, that I might cut it.<br> It could be done<br> if your wish were a command.<br> A typical butcher's solution.<br> Tigellinus would deprive you<br> of the one thing an artist must have:<br> - His audience.<br> - But they irk me, those people.<br> They irk me.<br> Do I live for them or do they live for me?<br> Unfortunately, Caesar, as a ruler,<br> you must have subjects to rule.<br> Sheer population is a necessary evil.<br> It is easy for Petronius to talk,<br> but the burden is on you.<br> On the only shoulders in the world<br> strong enough to bear it.<br> That's true, isn't it, Petronius?<br> It's lonely to be an emperor.<br> It is lonelier still to be a genius.<br> You're the only one who understands<br> the complications of my tortured nature.<br> Is that not a theme for a poem,<br> Petronius?<br> It is a theme for an epic, Divinity.<br> But to write it, you must suffer it.<br> Yes.<br> Where is Poppaea?<br> Where is my empress?<br> Here, lord. Always at your side.<br> Come. Petronius, you were right.<br> I must feel it, know it, live it.<br> Come, Petronius, attend me closely.<br> Attend me closely in my ordeal.<br> Hail Nero, son of Jupiter.<br> Look at him, my darling, the emperor.<br> - Wife killer. Mother killer.<br> - Quiet, woman, you'll have us all...<br> Everybody knows it. He's a beast.<br> Quiet.<br> No man is a beast.<br> Look at him<br> and know that he is but sick.<br> Sick in heart and spirit, in his soul.<br> You were right, Petronius.<br> How they love me.<br> How, indeed.<br> Remember, thou art only a man.<br> Remember, thou art only a man.<br> Marcus Vinicius.<br> Isn't he the one<br> who came to see Nero yesterday?<br> An arrogant man. He bears watching.<br> From what I hear, he might bear<br> watching at much closer range.<br> Poppaea, what are you muttering about?<br> Ha-ha.<br> Come closer.<br> Look, they march as they fight.<br> Strong, brave, relentless.<br> Our unconquerable children.<br> We must take them to our breast.<br> Yes, my lord.<br> Well.<br> The hero at last.<br> You know, Marcus, usually one<br> is embarrassed by one's relatives...<br> ...but today I was proud of you.<br> Hot work in that sun. A hippodrome.<br> The emperor positively adores you.<br> He called you his brave, relentless child.<br> If you play your hand well, you can have<br> a military governorship. Egypt, perhaps.<br> Sit down.<br> Relax before you take your bath.<br> Oh, very well.<br> And taste this.<br> Straight from the vines of Olympus.<br> Your Sicilian vintages<br> will pale to nothing.<br> - Well?<br> - What's the law regarding hostages?<br> Hostages?<br> Can they be bought, reassigned, what?<br> Well...<br> I take it this hostage is female?<br> Head to toe, hip to hip. What's the law?<br> When you see what I have for you,<br> you'll think of nothing else.<br> Now, this is the...<br> Well, here she is.<br> Bring her here.<br> Your exquisite wildflower<br> from the hills of Spain, Marcus.<br> - What's her name? I've forgotten.<br> - You called me Eunice, my lord.<br> Silence.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Eunice.<br> Lift your chin, Eunice.<br> Did you ever see such skin, Marcus?<br> Turn around, slowly.<br> Flawless proportions.<br> Fold your arms behind your head.<br> Makes one wish one were a sculptor.<br> Lovely.<br> Enough of my collector's enthusiasm.<br> She's the commander's.<br> Take her to his apartment.<br> I won't go.<br> What did you say?<br> Don't give me away, my lord.<br> Whip me, beat me,<br> but don't send me from here.<br> Don't send me from you, my lord.<br> You can stay here, girl. I don't want you.<br> You don't want her?<br> And I refused an offer from Seneca<br> of six Arabian stallions.<br> Keep her, Petronius. She's yours.<br> Well, by the body of Juno.<br> Nevertheless,<br> give her five lashes for impertinence.<br> You won't give me away, then, lord?<br> That depends on your future conduct.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, my good lord.<br> Ply the lash carefully, now.<br> Don't damage her skin.<br> No, master.<br> Tell me, now.<br> Can one purchase a hostage?<br> Where is this precious gem?<br> At Plautius' place. You should see her.<br> A fiery young Lygian.<br> She throws flames at you.<br> A Lygian?<br> Yes, I do recall a child assigned to him.<br> It was some years ago, I'd forgotten.<br> How can I get my hands on her?<br> Hostages are wards of the state.<br> She belongs to Nero.<br> Perfect. He would give me Egypt?<br> He can keep Egypt and give me Lygia.<br> We'll go to the palace.<br> Plautius may not be in accord with this.<br> Well, she will be.<br> They've sentimentalized her<br> into an adopted daughter.<br> Philosophers, teachers, fools.<br> This one wasn't born to think,<br> she was born to feel.<br> But, Marcus, with Plautius regarding her<br> as his daughter, I mean, is this ethical?<br> After all, he was a general of the empire.<br> I'll have her if I have to abduct her.<br> I sense a certain frustration.<br> Is your little barbarian<br> entirely in sympathy with your plan?<br> She'll be cooing like a pigeon<br> in the right circumstances.<br> I wish I had your confidence.<br> I've never been able to discover<br> an honest warmth in any woman.<br> Oh, my dear, beautiful lord.<br> I love you so.<br> Please, how can I let you know?<br> Open.<br> Open in the name of the emperor.<br> I have an order from the emperor.<br> Yes?<br> - For the hostage, Lygia.<br> My orders are to take her<br> to the women's quarters in the palace.<br> She's not a slave.<br> She is our daughter.<br> My orders are to take her at once.<br> Wait here.<br> You are the hostage, Lygia?<br> Yes.<br> Welcome to Nero's house of women.<br> My name is Acte, I am in charge here.<br> May I ask why I am here?<br> I would say you have attracted<br> the attention of the emperor.<br> And you have been commanded<br> to the feast.<br> But the emperor has never seen me.<br> There must be some other reason.<br> Nero ordered you brought here, just as<br> I was brought here seven years ago.<br> He loved me then, more than he knew.<br> Prepare the bath, oil of lilies.<br> And bring me the beaded cloth<br> from Persia, mostly blues, I think.<br> And, yes,<br> the strand of fine gold at the waist.<br> I am not honored by this.<br> You were brought up in the home<br> of Plautius and Pomponia, weren't you?<br> Yes. Yes, do you know them?<br> I know of them.<br> - Lygia, child, listen to me.<br> - Yes, yes, yes, chatter, chatter, chatter.<br> You'd think each one<br> had the hair of a queen.<br> Well, this one has possibilities at least.<br> What were you going to tell me?<br> Simply that you are the chosen guest<br> of Nero.<br> You are in the hands<br> of the master of the world.<br> You will have to consider that<br> your good fortune and your fate.<br> The hostage, Lygia.<br> Aren't you coming?<br> The emperor did not ask me.<br> She needed a poet, not a soldier,<br> to describe her.<br> Everything's there but the smile.<br> I leave that to you.<br> Petronius is quite right.<br> I wish I were a poet.<br> But I had you escorted here<br> in great honor.<br> I deserve a smile for that.<br> It was gracious of you.<br> Ten big, strong Praetorian Guards<br> to support my eagerness to come.<br> Well said, Lygia.<br> But you know a caravan of rare<br> merchandise is always well-guarded.<br> And you belong here, Lygia.<br> A king's daughter in a royal palace.<br> That's something<br> you should have a natural appetite for.<br> And I can tell you,<br> you have other natural appetites too.<br> Hasn't old Dull-Beard,<br> your philosopher friend, Paul...<br> ...told you about those?<br> Or has he lived in a cave all his life?<br> You should have seen my triumph today.<br> It was quite a display.<br> I looked for you, but then, I imagine<br> they had you chained to a peach tree.<br> Here. The panacea for all reticence.<br> You're right.<br> Your mouth has its own sweetness.<br> I know I'll find it so.<br> Don't look so frightened, Lygia.<br> I'm no heartless,<br> unfeeling machine of war.<br> I won't rush upon you<br> like a boulder from a catapult.<br> You've only to relax, smile a little,<br> and before you know it...<br> I can think of nothing, pray for nothing<br> but that this is over soon...<br> ...so that you can send me home again.<br> Home?<br> Yes.<br> Hail Nero.<br> Hail Nero.<br> Hail Nero.<br> Have you ever seen your emperor<br> and your god this close before?<br> No, I have never seen Nero<br> this close before.<br> Same faces.<br> Same noses.<br> All green.<br> Just for variety, divine lord, try a ruby.<br> Is that the hostage I brought<br> for Vinicius?<br> Oh, yes, yes, Divinity.<br> Mm, Vinicius has an eye.<br> She's exquisite.<br> You are generous, lord.<br> Perhaps you've overlooked something<br> for yourself.<br> Yes.<br> What do you think, Petronius?<br> Put a dress on an olive stump...<br> ...and my poor, untutored nephew<br> would call it beautiful.<br> I know your incomparable judgment,<br> Divinity.<br> And I'll wager you've already decided,<br> even from here...<br> ...that she is too narrow in the hips.<br> Yes, yes, that's exactly what I think.<br> Dear Poppaea,<br> one woman should never judge another.<br> She hasn't the glands for it. Ha-ha-ha.<br> Isn't that witty, Petronius?<br> Among the gods, your humor is unique.<br> Dear Petronius.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Too narrow in the hip.<br> Sing for us, Divinity, sing for us.<br> Sing for us, sing for us.<br> I had almost come to a tragic decision.<br> I had decided<br> not to sing for you tonight.<br> We beseech thee.<br> My throat hurts.<br> And when one has been given a divine<br> gift, one should not jeopardize it.<br> But I am not the only one afflicted.<br> My empress has a headache.<br> And the only thing<br> which will bring her relief...<br> ...is the sound of my voice.<br> You promised to sing,<br> or I would not be here.<br> I'm totally unprepared.<br> So I must compose as I sing.<br> Bravo.<br> You must be content with that.<br> My throat.<br> Watch Croton.<br> He's killed over 300 opponents.<br> He could twist the head off your Ursus<br> before he knew what touched him.<br> Orpheus at this moment must be as<br> yellow with envy as our poet Lucan.<br> I am as a candle next to the sun.<br> And you, Petronius, what do you say?<br> I say that your verses are common<br> and fit only for the fire they celebrate.<br> Farewell, Petronius.<br> What defect do you find in them?<br> Well, your verses would be worthy<br> of Ovid, of Virgil, even of Homer.<br> But they are not worthy of you.<br> The conflagration you describe<br> does not blaze enough.<br> It is not all-consuming.<br> Had Lucan here written these verses,<br> I should acknowledge him a genius.<br> But you can create a work<br> such as the world has never known.<br> Therefore, I say this to your eyes.<br> Take greater pains.<br> The gods have given me a certain talent,<br> but they've given me something greater.<br> A true judge and friend.<br> I thought it sufficient to equal Homer.<br> You have opened my eyes.<br> Then all men, born and unborn,<br> are my debtors.<br> You're right.<br> My conflagration does not burn enough.<br> And do you know why?<br> I've never seen a burning city.<br> You said one must suffer an experience<br> to re-create it.<br> A sculptor has his model.<br> I had no model.<br> To burn a city in order to create an epic.<br> That's carrying the principle<br> of art for art's sake too far.<br> Soon the spring will be over.<br> The summer heat will begin.<br> What stenches will arise from Rome?<br> I shall move the court to Antium.<br> You did not observe<br> Croton's masterful stroke.<br> I was not the only one.<br> Vinicius has hardly taken his eyes<br> from her.<br> She must be truly exciting.<br> I must see this for myself.<br> But it was a fair match.<br> It could have been one or the other.<br> You seemed pleased with my gift,<br> commander.<br> Is it enough, in the light of your service?<br> Or isn't it?<br> Do you know, lovely one?<br> Has he told you?<br> No, Caesar,<br> I thought it should come from you.<br> Know then, Lygia,<br> that I have given you to Marcus Vinicius...<br> ...as a reward for his devotion to me<br> and his brilliant service on the battlefield.<br> Henceforth, your guardian<br> is no longer General Plautius.<br> You belong to the household of Vinicius.<br> On closer inspection,<br> I find it a fair reward.<br> Perhaps excessive.<br> Except, of course,<br> as you so wisely observed, Divinity.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Too narrow in the hips. Ha-ha.<br> Let us go and greet my guests.<br> Now you know, Lygia.<br> And there were moments<br> when I thought I could love you.<br> Make use of your beauty, live with me.<br> Love as you were made to love.<br> What difference does it make<br> whether I love, now that you own me?<br> You have but to give the word,<br> the command.<br> The small, empty command.<br> Yes, I own you.<br> You realize that, don't you?<br> You realize I can take you<br> and have you flogged until you love me?<br> Take me, then.<br> Take me to your house, anything.<br> Take me and you'll hear nothing from me<br> but a prayer for you.<br> - Lygia.<br> - Commander Vinicius.<br> The empress<br> requests your presence at once.<br> Very well.<br> Here. Take this girl<br> to the house of Gaius Petronius.<br> Put her in charge of Anaxander,<br> master of slaves there.<br> Yes, commander.<br> Tears have but one use, Lygia.<br> As a prelude to joy.<br> Remember that while you wait for me.<br> You seem to have been having difficulty<br> in proving your ownership.<br> A young mare often enjoys<br> fighting the bit, empress.<br> I've always found conflict between<br> man and woman a waste of time.<br> It consumes so much...<br> So much vitality.<br> Well said, empress.<br> I am not your empress.<br> I'm a priestess of Amon,<br> and you are the serpent.<br> Therefore, poison is in your mouth.<br> And I have a taste for poison, Marcus.<br> To change to a serpent,<br> that might take time.<br> I can bring that about.<br> Those are Commander Vinicius' orders.<br> Here. Oh, how clumsy of me.<br> You see, I know your symbol,<br> even though I'm not yet one of you.<br> Have courage, child.<br> Come along.<br> Bear in mind, your fate is determined<br> by the greatest power in this world.<br> His will be done.<br> Aulus, my dear,<br> you must get some sleep.<br> I'll call you as soon as<br> Ursus sends word.<br> We should be hearing from Ursus soon<br> no matter what happened.<br> Good morning.<br> You're right, perhaps we'd better<br> ignore the formalities.<br> Will you tell Lygia I have come for her?<br> We've not seen Lygia<br> since she was taken from us.<br> Bring Lygia here at once.<br> I tell you, we don't know where she is.<br> - You're lying, general.<br> - I do not lie.<br> On my oath as a Roman officer,<br> so that you can understand, I do not lie.<br> You may search the house if you wish.<br> You refuse to say anything more?<br> Only this:<br> that you've violated our hospitality...<br> ...in the cruelest way a man could.<br> Hospitality?<br> You're overlooking<br> our law of hostages, aren't you?<br> The emperor assigned Lygia to my care.<br> She's my property.<br> You're overlooking<br> what's happening to Rome.<br> To the world, Vinicius.<br> It's such laws as this<br> that will tumble its foundations.<br> Your emperor, your god, Nero,<br> bathed in his own infamy.<br> - Aulus, my dear, please.<br> - I understand your concern.<br> I hope I shall continue to forget<br> what I just heard, general.<br> Marcus.<br> My dear young Marcus.<br> I want to call you that because<br> for all of your rank, you could be my son.<br> A woman of my years<br> is not unaware of things.<br> Lygia's eyes were drawn to you.<br> I saw that.<br> And they would not have been<br> if deep down inside of you...<br> ...you were this cold, this relentless.<br> Look in your heart, Marcus, and<br> recognize the truth of you that should be.<br> Well, as long as you<br> return empty-handed...<br> ...sit down<br> and fill your obviously empty stomach.<br> They claim to know nothing of her.<br> Plautius is lying.<br> Forget the whole undignified whim<br> and come with me to Antium.<br> There's something strange about Plautius<br> and that household.<br> By the gods,<br> they don't even talk like Romans.<br> And their friend,<br> a fellow from Tarsus named Paul.<br> Paul, you say? Of Tarsus?<br> Yes, he's some fool philosopher<br> I met there.<br> Paul of Tarsus.<br> My poor Marcus.<br> This is drama for the ages.<br> You picked the cherished egg<br> in a nest of Christians.<br> She's a Christian,<br> and Christians have spirited her away.<br> Christians. Are they the ones<br> who worship some dead carpenter?<br> Yes, that's right.<br> A rebel against the state,<br> a Jew called Christ.<br> Crucified in Palestine, as I remember.<br> The sect is a secret one.<br> It consists of Jews, Greeks,<br> and many others...<br> ...who meet in secret and spread<br> their superstitions among the Romans.<br> They are a constant worry<br> to Nero and the senate.<br> Tigellinus is always collecting<br> a group of them for questioning...<br> This calls for a detachment of Praetorians.<br> I'll tell Tigellinus to start a search.<br> Well, now, wait.<br> My dear boy,<br> that not only lacks dignity...<br> ...but these Christians<br> are known to be resourceful.<br> An open display of force will only bury<br> your little hostage deeper in the nest.<br> What do you suggest?<br> That I join the scurvy group?<br> Listen, I know of a Greek,<br> a man called Chilo.<br> He's a self-styled soothsayer,<br> astrologer, and diviner of mysteries.<br> I've no doubt he'd show the way<br> to your escaped Lygia before nightfall.<br> - Anaxander?<br> - Yes, master?<br> You know the house of Chilo?<br> - Yes, master.<br> - My nephew has urgent business there.<br> - Escort him.<br> - Yes, master.<br> Well, your advice has certain merit.<br> I'll give your Greek a chance.<br> - If you find her, bring her to Antium.<br> - I'll send you word.<br> You have heard, Eunice?<br> Is not love a madness?<br> Do not ask me, lord.<br> I am among the mad.<br> You love someone?<br> It was once prophesied<br> by an old woman...<br> ...that both pain and happiness<br> would visit me.<br> That's a safe prophesy about any human.<br> She spoke a rhyme, in which she said<br> my true fate was hidden.<br> Well?<br> Anon shall Venus rise<br> From out the violet Roman sea<br> And bear two lovers in her arms<br> Towards eternity<br> Whom do you love? Anaxander?<br> Mirmillon?<br> Oh, your beloved is not of this house?<br> He is, my lord.<br> What if I said that today you should go<br> with me to the violet Roman sea?<br> I'd swoon with happiness.<br> Only you haven't said it, my lord.<br> Then go ready yourself for Antium.<br> - You haven't yet swooned.<br> - I have no time, my lord.<br> I have no time. I have no time.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Hearing all this, I vow you've come<br> to the right man, Marcus Vinicius.<br> Speak. Can you find this girl?<br> Patience, lord. I must first verify<br> if she is truly of this Christian breed.<br> - My lord, do you read Greek?<br> - Passably.<br> Look here, then. What does that say?<br> - "Jesus Christ, Son of God, savior. "<br> - Exactly.<br> So it's the name of their dead God.<br> I've seen no such symbols.<br> Ah, but observe the first letters<br> of each word.<br> What do they spell?<br> I-C-T-H-U-S, icthus.<br> The Greek word for fish.<br> Have you seen the symbol of a fish<br> in all this?<br> Fish, why should I have seen a...?<br> - She once drew one.<br> - Aha. Their sign of recognition.<br> Fish are caught with a bait<br> and Christians with a fish.<br> How do I find her?<br> Where are the gatherings?<br> They practice foul rites at night...<br> ...in certain caves<br> and old ruins outside the city.<br> - Is there a gathering tonight?<br> - Possibly, lord.<br> But it is most dangerous.<br> There are hundreds of them.<br> I'll hire Croton the gladiator<br> to protect you. Does that suit?<br> Croton? Why, yes, lord.<br> We'll meet you here at sundown.<br> But, my lord, I shall need other arms.<br> A small weapon in advance, perhaps?<br> You see how they gather, lord?<br> In stealth, like thieves and murderers.<br> - That's the man I met at her house.<br> - Yes, she's here, without a doubt, lord.<br> I baptize thee in the name of the Father<br> and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<br> - What's he doing now?<br> - They call it baptism.<br> An evil bath of black water.<br> I know there are some here<br> who still hold back in doubt.<br> A few who have not accepted baptism.<br> Our Lord Jesus understood that...<br> ...and he welcomed questions,<br> as the right of free men.<br> But at last, there is one among us tonight<br> for whom we have long waited.<br> Who was there when the people<br> gathered about Christ and questioned him.<br> Who heard the answers<br> from his own lips.<br> A man who saw the face of Jesus<br> and touched his hand.<br> He comes from Jerusalem.<br> The fisherman, Simon, called Peter.<br> The first apostle of our Lord.<br> Unworthy though I am, Jesus said to me:<br> "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock<br> I will build my church. "<br> He has guided my feet to Rome...<br> ...so that together<br> we can begin to build his church here.<br> I give thanks for the faith you have in him<br> whom you have never seen...<br> ...but whose voice you have heard<br> and answered in your hearts.<br> I heard his voice by the Sea of Galilee.<br> My brothers and I were fishermen.<br> All the night through we had been fishing<br> and had caught nothing.<br> We were cold and very tired.<br> As our boat was coming into the shore,<br> I heard someone call my name.<br> I looked up and a man stood there.<br> At the sight of him, the cold and<br> weariness left me, my heart grew light.<br> I answered, "Yes, friend?"<br> He called and asked<br> that he might come into our boat...<br> ...so he could speak better to the people<br> who were pressing around him on shore.<br> We bade him enter.<br> He spoke to the people<br> about the kingdom of heaven at hand.<br> Suddenly, my heart leapt in my breast and<br> I knew that he was the Christ to come.<br> When he had finished, he said to me:<br> "Go out into deep waters<br> and let down your nets. "<br> In a moment,<br> the nets were full as if by a miracle.<br> He looked at my wonderment and said:<br> "Do not be afraid. From henceforth,<br> you shall be a fisher of men. "<br> He told me to follow him, and I did.<br> I and my brothers, James and John.<br> Throughout the length and breadth<br> of the land, we followed him.<br> Others joined us until<br> besides himself, we were 12.<br> To the hungry and thirsty,<br> he gave food and drink.<br> To those who were sick and worn<br> and weary, he gave hope and peace.<br> Who but the Son of God<br> could have brought such gifts to man?<br> Who but the Son of God could have<br> commanded the storm to be calm?<br> Who but he could have raised<br> Lazarus of Bethany from the dead...<br> ...and given peace to the heart<br> of Mary Magdalene?<br> And yet, I lived to deny this man.<br> He himself foretold that I would<br> on the night of our last supper.<br> "Lord, " I had said, "I am willing to<br> follow you both to prison and to death. "<br> But he answered:<br> "Peter, this night,<br> before the cock crows...<br> ...thou shalt deny me thrice. "<br> And I did.<br> Three times outside the house<br> of his judges.<br> When they accused me<br> of being with him, I said:<br> "I know not the man. "<br> With a curse for the weakness of my body<br> in the face of death.<br> Then they weighed him down with a cross<br> and scourged him.<br> And at a place called Calvary...<br> ...they crucified him,<br> with a crown of thorns upon his head.<br> But even in the midst<br> of his suffering, Jesus said:<br> "Father, forgive them,<br> for they know not what they do. "<br> Only the Son of God<br> could have forgiven them...<br> ...as he forgave me for my denial of him.<br> But he who raised the dead<br> could not be conquered by death.<br> The room in which we later sat,<br> in silence and in sorrow...<br> ...was filled suddenly with a great light<br> and the risen Lord stood before us.<br> We saw his hands that the nails<br> had pierced and his wounded side...<br> ...and we knew indeed<br> that he was the Lord.<br> And we heard his voice say,<br> "Peace be unto you. "<br> And he commanded us to preach<br> to all men his holy word.<br> Blessed are the poor in spirit,<br> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br> Blessed are they who mourn,<br> for they shall be comforted.<br> Blessed are the meek,<br> for they shall inherit the earth.<br> Blessed are they which do hunger<br> and thirst after righteousness...<br> ...for they shall be filled.<br> Blessed are the merciful,<br> for they shall obtain mercy.<br> Blessed are the pure in heart,<br> for they shall see God.<br> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they<br> shall be called the children of God.<br> But beyond these things, Jesus asks us<br> to obey the commandments...<br> ...which God gave to the prophet Moses.<br> Obey those who govern you<br> and the laws by which they govern.<br> Even though, under them,<br> you suffer cruelties...<br> ...and witness maliciousness<br> beyond your mind's dimensions...<br> ...make no threat of violence in return.<br> And in the words of Jesus,<br> I further say to you...<br> ...whosoever shall smite thee upon thy<br> right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br> Love thy neighbor as thyself.<br> Whatsoever you would that men should<br> do to you, do ye even so to them.<br> Love your enemies.<br> Bless them that curse you.<br> Do good to them that hate you.<br> And pray for them that despitefully<br> use you and persecute you.<br> Oh, believe in him.<br> Endure all things in his name,<br> so that you may dwell in blessedness.<br> Even from everlasting to everlasting.<br> Amen.<br> Amen.<br> Endure all things in his name,<br> that you may dwell in blessedness.<br> If I smite him on one cheek, the old rat<br> will have no chance to turn the other.<br> I don't know.<br> The old rat has courage of sorts.<br> Will you both come to our house<br> tomorrow to see Peter and Paul?<br> We must bide our time,<br> we may be watched.<br> Good night, Father. Good night, Mother.<br> There. There she is.<br> - Well, commander?<br> - Come along.<br> That giant looks as though<br> he had the strength of a Cretan bull.<br> - Do you think you can down him?<br> - I'll squeeze the seeds out of him.<br> Wait. We're being followed.<br> - I don't hear anyone.<br> - Three times I have heard.<br> They stop when we do.<br> Go on to the house.<br> - But what will...?<br> - Go to the house.<br> Go no further, commander.<br> - Step aside.<br> - My lord, you haven't paid me.<br> It's only a small cut in the scalp,<br> but they always bleed the most.<br> Hot water.<br> I'll get some ointment.<br> Look. Did you do that too, Ursus?<br> No, dear. That's an old scar.<br> A scar? What from?<br> Probably some battle wound.<br> That's right. He's one of Nero's<br> best generals, isn't he?<br> Here. Come, Nazarius,<br> it's time you were asleep.<br> - But, Mother, did you see the big sword...?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - Wash the wound thoroughly first, Lygia.<br> - Yes.<br> Come, Ursus.<br> Ursus wishes to speak to you.<br> - Yes?<br> - I want to ask...<br> ...the commander's forgiveness.<br> I killed his friend.<br> Ha-ha. You killed Croton?<br> Good man. I told you you'd be a<br> champion. Kill the old Greek too?<br> The other man disappeared.<br> I'll wager he did, and fast.<br> Please say you'll forgive him.<br> For what? Croton faced his chances.<br> Killing was his profession.<br> Of all the gods, why didn't you kill me?<br> In our faith, it is a sin to kill.<br> I seem to remember.<br> He should have killed me.<br> You should have had him kill me.<br> But instead, you bring me in<br> and patch me up, all of you who hate me.<br> You've defeated me, Lygia.<br> Go on home. Stop hiding.<br> I won't come pursuing you<br> about the countryside any longer.<br> You're free and rid of me, Lygia.<br> You could look happier about it.<br> Well, so be it.<br> Marcus.<br> Oh, Marcus, you know I don't hate you.<br> Lygia.<br> - Oh, Marcus, Marcus.<br> - The sweetness of you.<br> Oh, this is the beauty, I knew it.<br> I should have known it had to happen<br> when I watched you leave the gathering.<br> - You were there?<br> - Yes.<br> I should have known what I really wished.<br> You with me always as my wife.<br> Will you do that, Lygia?<br> Will you give me the greatest triumph<br> a man ever had? Be my wife?<br> Oh, yes, Marcus.<br> Gather what you need<br> and let's be gone from this den.<br> - Hurry.<br> - Yes, Marcus, I'll hurry.<br> We'll go to Antium.<br> Petronius will outdo himself.<br> A ceremony and wedding feast<br> such as never has been seen.<br> And even that will be lost moments.<br> Oh...<br> Marcus, Paul will be here soon.<br> I would like so much to ask his blessing.<br> Perhaps let him say the words over us.<br> What words?<br> You've heard enough of his words.<br> They've deafened your ears<br> to everything life has to tell you.<br> But you heard Peter and Paul speak.<br> Did you hear anything<br> that was ugly or wrong?<br> I heard a childish old man<br> speak in riddles.<br> Believe as they do...<br> ...and you'll think a cow is a bull<br> and a bull is an ox and an ox is a goat.<br> Oh, Marcus, dear.<br> I thought, having heard,<br> you might begin to know...<br> ...to understand why.<br> Here, now.<br> Is this the symbol of your God,<br> your Christ?<br> The cross on which he was crucified.<br> I'm willing to accept your God,<br> if it makes you happier.<br> I don't demand it.<br> In our gardens in Sicily, we'll put up<br> a big cross, higher than the roof.<br> I'll put up a special pedestal and crown it<br> with a figure of your Christ...<br> ...carved from the finest marble.<br> You'll have to have Peter<br> tell the sculptor what he looks like.<br> - Marcus, listen to me...<br> - Why not? It's no trouble.<br> There's such an army of gods these days<br> we can always find room for another.<br> I'm not asking it as a condition<br> of our having one another.<br> I just hope and pray that one day...<br> ...the image of Christ<br> will appear in your heart.<br> My heart is only for you.<br> There won't be room for him there.<br> There will be.<br> I always carry him in mine with you.<br> Well, take him out<br> if he means that much, Lygia.<br> - Do you hear me? Get rid of him.<br> - Well.<br> I'm glad to see you on your feet again.<br> Last night and this morning,<br> you had us quite concerned.<br> Paul.<br> - Marcus has just asked me to be his wife.<br> - Oh?<br> I'm sure that this has<br> brought her great joy, Marcus.<br> You could see, Paul, that I loved him.<br> I was just trying to explain to him that...<br> Well, that there are other things. I mean...<br> - I understand.<br> - I don't.<br> I offered to accept the symbols<br> of her God into my house.<br> I don't ask her to accept mine.<br> What more can I do to prove<br> that I'm not an enemy of her God?<br> Marcus.<br> For some of us it takes months,<br> years of thought...<br> ...of contemplation,<br> of looking back on our lives...<br> ...on the course of mankind<br> and realizing...<br> Tell me what more I should do.<br> Well, you own slaves, do you not?<br> Hundreds. Good ones too. Why?<br> Jesus wishes no man to be in bondage.<br> You should set them free.<br> Set them free?<br> But they're mine, I own them.<br> But you can't buy human beings,<br> Marcus.<br> Faith in Christ is based on love.<br> He asks all people to love one another.<br> So I heard your old fisherman say. You<br> want me to love the whole human race?<br> You want me to love Parthians,<br> Egyptians, Persians?<br> The rest who wanna put a blade<br> through my ribs?<br> Has it occurred to you<br> to put down your sword...<br> ...and renounce war<br> against these people?<br> That you might conquer them with love?<br> Yes, yes,<br> you tame a pack of wolves with a feather.<br> It's occurred to me<br> you've a whining beggar for God.<br> A cringing God for slaves, aliens,<br> and outcasts like yourself.<br> But that's not Lygia.<br> Let's be gone from this idiocy of words.<br> Get your cloak, Lygia.<br> - Marcus, dear, a moment more.<br> - We've lost too much time as it is.<br> You're going to be wife of<br> Commander Marcus Vinicius...<br> ...not the miserable slave<br> of some crucified carpenter.<br> Oh, Marcus, try to understand my faith,<br> my beliefs, my very deep beliefs.<br> Don't force me to choose.<br> You mean, between me and your Christ?<br> Yes, choose.<br> I'd no more share you with your Christ<br> than I would with other men.<br> But, Marcus, don't you see?<br> Unless you try to understand, what we<br> feel for each other will destroy itself.<br> Destroy us.<br> My son, your love for Lygia,<br> great and beautiful as you feel it...<br> ...is small compared with your love<br> for all mankind.<br> What sort of love is it that acknowledges<br> a force greater than itself?<br> What runs in your veins, philosopher,<br> blood or water?<br> What sort of poison are you spreading?<br> Are you coming with me, Lygia?<br> Lygia.<br> No, my dear.<br> Twice today, I've been a fool.<br> But I'll not go back on my word.<br> You can go your way.<br> I'll not disclose what I've seen or heard.<br> Something is hidden<br> behind your meek words, philosopher.<br> Yours and your fanatical fisherman's.<br> They strike at Rome and Roman law.<br> I warn you, if ever Roman rule<br> is threatened, you'll feel my sword.<br> I almost...<br> I wanted to go with him, Paul.<br> Lygia.<br> Even our Lord knew temptation.<br> Your strength too will prevail<br> and be rewarded in this.<br> I know that.<br> Yes, yes.<br> These will be the imperial gardens,<br> where the cattle market now stands?<br> Yes, Divinity.<br> Each palace rising out of its own lake...<br> ...surfaced with water fowl<br> of the rarest plumage.<br> No longer will the stench of pig and oxen<br> rise up the slopes of the Palatine.<br> No. It shall be landscaped<br> with Damascene roses.<br> Oh, Phaon, you are an architect<br> who could have laid the plans of Olympus.<br> - My lord, I have brought food.<br> - Take it away.<br> - It comes to life...<br> - You've not eaten since morning, my lord.<br> Be gone with it, all of you!<br> You irritate me.<br> Why do you stare at me, Acte?<br> My lord...<br> I can only say...<br> When all this sets with the final sun,<br> remember the look of Acte.<br> Why should I remember you?<br> No one loves you as I love you.<br> I command you to stop loving me!<br> I cannot, lord.<br> Forgive me.<br> For years,<br> she has been a thorn in my flesh.<br> Now that thorn will be removed.<br> Henceforth, you are banished from Rome<br> and from my sight.<br> One day, Nero, you will need me.<br> And I will come to you.<br> Is it not disgusting<br> when common bovine solicitude...<br> ...replaces the fire in a woman's body?<br> Ah, but what pulsating purity<br> there is in fire.<br> My new Rome shall spring<br> from the loins of fire...<br> ...a twisting, writhing, breathing flame.<br> What do you think Petronius<br> will say to this?<br> You doubt his approval, my lord?<br> I too remember his strange look at the<br> feast when the thought first came to you.<br> - I should be careful lest...<br> - No, no.<br> Petronius appreciates my genius<br> even more than you, dear Phaon.<br> It's just that he may not fully understand<br> the method, the means I must use...<br> ...to bring this greatest<br> of my accomplishments into being.<br> He seems to be well-occupied<br> at the moment.<br> When I have news of Tigellinus coming,<br> I shall summon him with the others.<br> This must be disclosed to him<br> with intelligence...<br> ...with, uh, sincerity.<br> Yes.<br> There you are.<br> - Marcus.<br> - Hmm?<br> Well, it's your game.<br> Only two games you've won<br> in three weeks, Marcus.<br> Does the play bore you?<br> I fear I have met my superior.<br> I fear you might have met<br> something else.<br> Other than a glare of distaste...<br> ...I've been given no details<br> concerning your sudden renunciation...<br> ...of your little Christian hostage.<br> Your well-bred curiosity<br> now breaks its bounds, eh?<br> It shatters me.<br> Well, uncle, it happened quite simply.<br> Your valiant Greek led me to Lygia<br> and a swarming hive of idiots.<br> Their black honey choked my mouth<br> and I said words I never thought I'd utter.<br> For their mammoth stupidity<br> I should've been broken in half...<br> ...and dropped piecemeal<br> into the sewers.<br> - Fascinated?<br> - In a way.<br> Yes?<br> The empress requests your presence<br> in her pavilion, commander.<br> At once.<br> I leave you to your fascination.<br> I have been summoned to mine.<br> None of this bodes well.<br> Wouldn't the emperor be angry<br> if he should...?<br> Poppaea's indulgences<br> merely stimulate him to his own.<br> But I sense a fresh preoccupation<br> in Nero.<br> For some time now, he has avoided me.<br> My lord is troubled?<br> A doubled guard and yesterday...<br> ...Tigellinus and a squadron of his<br> butchers left for Rome.<br> I feel a strange and heavy breeze.<br> Oh, my dear lord.<br> Even your little song is sad<br> with its note of death.<br> It is just words.<br> And I sing it joyfully.<br> Because love such as I feel<br> cannot ever die.<br> As always,<br> your entrance is proud and aloof.<br> I come proudly, as fast as my hands<br> and knees will carry me.<br> And as always,<br> sardonic and unassailable.<br> Unassailable?<br> I've never been so readily, so happily,<br> so expertly vanquished in my life.<br> I believe everything<br> except the word "vanquished."<br> I should like to vanquish you, Marcus.<br> Like the spider who eats her mate<br> when he is no longer a necessity?<br> Mm-hm. Something like that.<br> I heard today<br> you're planning to leave for Sicily.<br> Three years away,<br> there's much to look after.<br> Will you sail from here<br> or will you go via Rome?<br> Rome?<br> That's rather an indirect route, isn't it?<br> Then I shall be direct.<br> I know about your little<br> Christian hostage vanishing.<br> I've eyes and ears<br> in the Praetorian Guard.<br> And an arm or two<br> to fit your waist, no doubt?<br> Possibly.<br> Did you find her, Marcus?<br> Naturally.<br> Only to find myself a fool<br> and sever her chains, I might add.<br> You severed them thoroughly?<br> Thoroughly.<br> I'm glad.<br> Marcus.<br> Because you know how I consoled myself<br> when you vanished from the feast.<br> Spare me names, dear empress.<br> I consoled myself<br> with the thought of your death.<br> I fondled your bodiless head...<br> ...running my fingers through your hair,<br> making you smile and frown.<br> May I ask what stopped you?<br> It is foolish to kill those you hate,<br> because once dead they are beyond pain.<br> And I hated you, Marcus.<br> I welcome your change of heart, at least.<br> But if ever she bewitches you again,<br> I shall know.<br> And since I have no hatred for her,<br> I do not care whether she feels pain.<br> You'd never turn the other cheek to me,<br> would you?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> But my mouth is here.<br> Where is Petronius?<br> Have you summoned him?<br> - Have you called Petronius?<br> - Yes, Caesar.<br> Well, summon him again. Tell him l...<br> As ever, I'm impatient for you.<br> I have missed you, Divinity.<br> Petronius, forgive me<br> if I seem to have slighted you of late.<br> I have been steeped in my genius<br> beyond all description.<br> I sense a fresh inspiration.<br> Your senses shall leap to it.<br> Attend me. Attend me, all.<br> My lack of consideration for you<br> during the past few days...<br> ...in keeping you from my presence,<br> forces me to impress upon you again...<br> ...the tribulations of the true artist.<br> When I play and sing, I have visions<br> of things I never dreamed existed.<br> The world is mine.<br> And mine to end.<br> Music opens up new worlds for me.<br> Draws back the veil from new delights.<br> I can see Olympus...<br> ...and a breeze blows on me<br> from beyond the Earth.<br> And in those moments...<br> ...I, a god, feel as diminutive as dust.<br> This is a day for sincerity.<br> Let me open my soul to you.<br> Do you think I do not know...<br> ...that there are people in Rome<br> who call me a matricide, a wife killer?<br> Hold me a monster?<br> Tyrant?<br> But there is something<br> they do not realize.<br> A man's acts may be cruel<br> while he himself is not cruel.<br> And there are moments,<br> my dear Petronius...<br> ...when music caresses my soul.<br> I feel as gentle as a child in a cradle.<br> Believe me?<br> All men should know you<br> as we do, Divinity.<br> Only then would they be able<br> to appreciate you.<br> Yet there are those<br> who say that I am mad.<br> I'm only seeking.<br> The flatness and misery<br> of common life depress me.<br> I seek because I must exceed<br> the stature of man in both good and evil.<br> I seek because I must be greater<br> than man...<br> ...for only then<br> will I be the supreme artist.<br> Do you know why I condemned<br> both my wife...<br> ...and my mother to death?<br> I did it in order to lay at the gates<br> of an unknown world...<br> ...the greatest sacrifice<br> a man can put there.<br> Now, I thought, doors will open...<br> ...beyond which I shall catch<br> a glimpse of the unknown.<br> Let it be wonderful.<br> Or let it be awful.<br> So long as it is uncommon.<br> So now.<br> Behold, dear Petronius.<br> My new Rome.<br> It shall rise in gleaming white beauty.<br> Master gem of the world's crown.<br> It shall have a new name.<br> Neropolis, city of Nero.<br> - Magnificent.<br> - You have outdone yourself.<br> Something the world has never seen.<br> But what of the Rome<br> that has stood for a thousand years?<br> After all, Divinity,<br> the old Rome, our Rome...<br> ...dirty and magnificent,<br> but still our beloved Rome...<br> ...it still stands.<br> Does it?<br> It still stands.<br> We never thought of that, did we?<br> Or does it, Tigellinus?<br> Rome is a sea of flames.<br> It burns from rim to rim.<br> You hear that? That is my epic.<br> To change the face of the world.<br> To demolish and create, and create anew.<br> Now, to your chariots, all of you.<br> You shall come with me<br> to the funeral pyre.<br> This very night you shall hear<br> my dirge over burning Rome.<br> Its flames shall carry me<br> higher than the gods.<br> - All of Rome is burning?<br> - All but the Palatine area.<br> - What of the section across the river?<br> - An inferno.<br> - Thousands of roofs going up like tinder.<br> Marcus.<br> Stop Vinicius. Hold him.<br> Now, indeed,<br> Nero has his place in history.<br> Look, there's one of Nero's soldiers.<br> He burned Rome.<br> The people here, the girl with the giant,<br> have you seen them?<br> They left. Don't kill me, don't kill me.<br> Mama, Mama.<br> Mama.<br> Mama, Mama.<br> Here, go on. Take care of her.<br> The sewers. The sewers lead to the river.<br> Into the sewers.<br> Lygia.<br> Marcus.<br> Lygia.<br> Oh, Marcus, Marcus, I prayed to see you.<br> Marcus, Miriam is dead, in the fire.<br> - She...<br> My mother.<br> A wall fell on her.<br> We'll get you out of this, son.<br> The Praetorians are holding the bridge.<br> Open up.<br> - Who's in command here?<br> - I am.<br> Open this barricade.<br> Imperial orders. We're to keep them<br> from entering the Palatine area.<br> Break ranks. Let them through.<br> Hold your line there.<br> I'm in charge here,<br> commander, and by the...<br> Break ranks, I say.<br> Petronius, look what I've created!<br> Tigellinus, my robe of grief.<br> Terpnos, lyre.<br> History will judge my song, Petronius.<br> Will it be great enough<br> to match the occasion?<br> I'm seized with the fear<br> that it will not be great enough.<br> You will be worthy of the spectacle,<br> as the spectacle is worthy of you.<br> You encourage me, Petronius.<br> But I'm aware that I must compete with<br> those who sang of the burning of Troy.<br> My song must be greater,<br> just as Rome is greater than Troy.<br> Silence, ye spheres<br> Be still, ye hurtling stars<br> Open wide-vaulted skies above me<br> Now, at last, lo, I see Olympus<br> And a light from its summit<br> Doth illumine me<br> I am one with the gods, immortal<br> I am Nero<br> The artist who creates with fire<br> That the dreams of my life<br> May come true<br> To the flames now I give the past<br> To the flames and soil<br> Take thou this Rome<br> Oh, receive her now, ye flames<br> Consume her as would a furnace<br> Burn on, O ancient Rome<br> Burn on, burn on<br> The mob from burned areas.<br> They want to survive.<br> Who asked them to survive?<br> Tigellinus.<br> The palace is fully guarded, Majesty.<br> They will never pass my Praetorians.<br> The night is chilly.<br> Let us withdraw.<br> Is it possible that human beings<br> can produce such a sound?<br> Yes, when they've been driven too far.<br> Death to Nero.<br> Death to the incendiary.<br> They'll break through.<br> Summon all the detachments<br> from the barracks.<br> Death to the incendiary.<br> They're shouting something.<br> What are they shouting?<br> They have given you a new title, Divinity.<br> "Incendiary."<br> I've sent for reinforcements.<br> I hope they arrive in time.<br> I'd speak to the mob.<br> Make some promises.<br> I do not ask favors, I confer them.<br> You go. Speak to them in my name.<br> Not until detachments arrive,<br> then I'll speak with steel.<br> They'd stone me to death now.<br> In what better cause could you die?<br> This was your architect's dream.<br> Go and tell them, Phaon.<br> This is all for them.<br> How can we admit that, Divinity?<br> You're right, we must never admit it.<br> How can I expect that mob<br> to share my vision?<br> Seneca, what do you advise?<br> The mob is a wild animal,<br> and with an animal you cannot reason.<br> I'm surrounded by eunuchs.<br> Why do you stand aloof?<br> You're my counselor.<br> Why don't you counsel me?<br> Let them enter, we shall all die.<br> All except you.<br> You, of course, being a god, are immortal.<br> Your levity is ill-timed, Petronius.<br> They'll destroy you also.<br> I do not share your passion<br> for self-preservation.<br> I love Rome,<br> and I am not eager to survive it.<br> You're not like these other people.<br> They think that you're their friend.<br> Speak to them, make promises.<br> Grain, oil, wine.<br> They will take them, Nero,<br> without your permission.<br> Insatiable and thankless mob.<br> - What do they want?<br> - Justice.<br> No mob ever wants justice.<br> They want vengeance.<br> A victim.<br> Tigellinus, it was you who burnt Rome.<br> At your command, Nero.<br> Tigellinus, do you love me?<br> - You know it, lord.<br> - Then prove it.<br> Go to the mob,<br> bare your breast to them and your guilt.<br> I would do so gladly, Nero...<br> ...but I am head of the Praetorian Guard<br> and the Praetorians love me.<br> If I die, they may turn against you.<br> I cannot subject you to that danger.<br> Are you threatening me, Tigellinus?<br> Do you hear him threaten me<br> with the Praetorian Guard?<br> You're all willing to desert me. I know it.<br> I feel it.<br> Nero, my beloved, you were right.<br> Give the people what they want.<br> Give them blood and vengeance.<br> Not one victim, but a hundred,<br> a thousand.<br> Victims? What victims?<br> A group who worship one<br> they say is higher than you.<br> They are the enemies<br> of the human race, and of you.<br> Who are these people?<br> They despise our temples<br> and our gods...<br> ...and prophesy that the end of the world<br> shall be caused by fire.<br> Well, then,<br> make their prophesy come true.<br> Let it end for them.<br> Who are they?<br> They call themselves Christians.<br> Christians?<br> Yes, I've heard of them.<br> The empress speaks rightly, Caesar.<br> The people hate these Christians.<br> They are the enemies of Rome<br> and of the state.<br> The people want vengeance, Nero.<br> Let them have it.<br> The people suspect you.<br> Let their suspicion turn<br> in this more beneficial direction.<br> - Surely, my lord...<br> - They should pay, Caesar.<br> They must pay.<br> Do you hear?<br> The Christians are plotting to destroy me.<br> You have often reminded us, Nero,<br> of the judgment of history.<br> What will its verdict be<br> if you punish the innocent...<br> ...and betray your own greatness?<br> Let future ages,<br> looking back at this time...<br> ...regard Nero<br> with wonder and amazement.<br> Nero, the ruler of the world.<br> Nero, a god, burned Rome<br> because he was as powerful as Jupiter.<br> He loved poetry so much<br> that he sacrificed Rome for a song.<br> History need not say<br> that the burning of Rome was good...<br> ...but it must say<br> that it was colossal, uncommon.<br> I cannot listen to any veiled suggestion<br> that my emperor is a coward.<br> That is amusing.<br> You, who were too cowardly<br> to risk your life for him yourself.<br> Petronius is right.<br> You refused to die for me.<br> He wants to preserve your enemies.<br> I want to kill them.<br> - Why do you defend these people?<br> - I'll tell you why, my lord.<br> Because his nephew, Vinicius,<br> loves a Christian girl, Lygia.<br> And it may be Petronius<br> is himself a Christian.<br> Petronius, are you a Christian?<br> I am not.<br> I have heard that the Christians<br> teach you to love your neighbor.<br> And as I see what men are...<br> ...I cannot, for the life of me,<br> love my fellow man.<br> Ha!<br> He does not love you, gentlemen.<br> A tablet, Phaon.<br> The people shall have their vengeance.<br> I hereby proclaim that the guilt<br> of the burning of our beloved city...<br> ...rests with the foul sect<br> which calls itself Christian.<br> They have spread the lie<br> that it was Nero who burnt Rome.<br> I will exterminate these criminals...<br> ...in a manner<br> matching the enormity of their crime.<br> Their punishment will be a warning.<br> A spectacle of terror...<br> ...to all evil men...<br> ...everywhere and forever...<br> ...who would harm you or harm Rome...<br> ...or harm your emperor...<br> ...who loves you.<br> Pause, Nero, before you sign this decree.<br> Rome has given the world<br> justice and order.<br> Sign that,<br> and Roman justice will receive a blow...<br> ...from which it may never recover.<br> Condemn these Christians<br> and you make martyrs of them...<br> ...and insure their immortality.<br> Condemn them,<br> and in the eyes of history...<br> ...you'll condemn yourself.<br> When I have finished<br> with these Christians, Petronius...<br> ...history will not be sure<br> that they ever existed.<br> When I grow up, I'm gonna be a sailor.<br> Nothing burns at sea.<br> There's too much water.<br> Nero can burn the whole ocean.<br> Marcus.<br> Did you rest well?<br> I was impatient to see the sunrise,<br> and here you are.<br> You should have slept longer.<br> Your journey from Antium<br> and last night must have...<br> I've been asleep too long<br> in many ways, Lygia.<br> I must return to the city at once,<br> meet with Nerva and the others.<br> Yes, Rome and what it stands for.<br> Something must be done<br> about this maniac.<br> There must be an answer to this,<br> quickly, decisive.<br> You do know the answer.<br> You do understand.<br> There can be no<br> turning the other cheek now, Lygia.<br> If I have not returned by nightfall,<br> I'll send word.<br> Marcus Vinicius?<br> We have not met,<br> but I have heard of you.<br> You must realize how grateful we are<br> for what you have done.<br> For your concern for Lygia.<br> My only concern is for Lygia.<br> Hold yourself straight, youngster.<br> A man must be a soldier.<br> I don't want to be a soldier.<br> Let's talk about our journey.<br> We'll be meeting Paul in Greece,<br> you know.<br> That's good.<br> You'll like Greece, Nazarius.<br> You'll help me to fish for men there.<br> And I think we'll have time<br> to fish for fish too.<br> Are we leaving soon?<br> As soon as we eat.<br> We shall be starting within the hour.<br> I'm glad,<br> because I don't like it here anymore.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> We shall be fishermen together.<br> Please, my lord,<br> do not trouble yourself so.<br> It is a moment for thought, Eunice.<br> Yesterday, I could have gone to the mob<br> and told them that Nero burned Rome.<br> I could've offered them a new emperor<br> in General Galba...<br> ...and so set my seal upon the times.<br> But I did not.<br> Do you know why, Eunice?<br> I know nothing of these things, my lord.<br> Because I love Nero, perhaps?<br> He fills me with loathing.<br> No, because out of force of long habit...<br> ...I've become content<br> only to be an amused cynic...<br> ...a selfish onlooker,<br> leaving others to shape the world.<br> Marcus.<br> The gods be praised.<br> I was worried about you.<br> You know Nerva, here.<br> My third in command, Justin Scipio.<br> We meet in a ghastly hour, gentlemen.<br> We've made our decision.<br> The time has come for Galba<br> to replace Nero.<br> Justin is taking this message to him...<br> ...asking him to come with his legions<br> in all haste.<br> Your signature added to these will make<br> Galba confident of his reception.<br> I know you will give it.<br> I sign it with humility.<br> On your way.<br> You took a risk in coming here.<br> You're a marked man.<br> You scorned Poppaea.<br> She has death in her eye for you<br> and your Lygia.<br> I'll chance that.<br> Take Lygia<br> and leave Rome as quickly as possible.<br> At least you'll be spared<br> Nero's final horror.<br> He is about to extinguish his conflagration<br> in a sea of blood.<br> Whose blood?<br> Did you not hear his orators<br> at the street corners?<br> Already the people are being given<br> the story, along with grain and wine...<br> ...that it was the Christians and not Nero<br> who set fire to Rome.<br> - They won't believe such a lie.<br> - But they are believing it.<br> The people will believe any lie<br> if it is fantastic enough.<br> I'll meet you at your house by midday.<br> We will keep you informed.<br> Farewell, Marcus.<br> Farewell.<br> Farewell?<br> What do you mean, my lord?<br> My dear, this morning<br> Nero sent to inquire after my health.<br> A Praetorian officer<br> brought his solicitude.<br> It is easy to see<br> that he means to amuse himself...<br> ...by making a sport of my extermination.<br> - But then you must...<br> - No, no, my dear.<br> I have the means to disappoint him.<br> Send Anaxander to me.<br> I will give him the names<br> of those few I love.<br> He will go and ask them<br> to dine with us tonight.<br> - Gen. Plautius, his family, where are they?<br> - You're late, they're already imprisoned.<br> The Praetorians came<br> and collected the whole scurvy lot.<br> Me, raising my children<br> right by the house of dirty Christians.<br> Burn the city, will they?<br> Put them in Number 4.<br> Have you the family<br> of General Plautius here?<br> I do not know, commander.<br> See if we have them.<br> I have an order<br> for their immediate release.<br> A signed order? By whom?<br> I do not accept questions, Praetorian.<br> I transmit orders.<br> A seasoned campaigner trapped by love.<br> We've been expecting you.<br> As soldiers, we've always hoped to die<br> a quick and noble death...<br> ...haven't we, Vinicius?<br> But Nero has in mind for you<br> something more leisurely...<br> ...and certainly ignoble.<br> Put him with his Christian friends.<br> Marcus?<br> Oh, why did they take you?<br> This is none of your doing.<br> I carry my share of the blame.<br> We knew they were looking for you,<br> but we had no way to send warning.<br> This is a sad reward for your friendship.<br> Marcus, I once accused you bitterly.<br> I'm proved wrong.<br> It's no triumph for me to find you here.<br> General Plautius, l...<br> The lions!<br> It is the lions.<br> No, no, please, God!<br> No, I can't stand...<br> No, dear, no.<br> We must be strong in him, in each other.<br> Where is he, then?<br> If he is so all-powerful as you say,<br> why do we find ourselves here?<br> My friend, stand firm.<br> My two babies and all of our children<br> to be sold into slavery.<br> Is that what the redeemer promised us?<br> Only by strength in faith<br> will we be able to endure the ordeal.<br> I thank God Peter and Paul were spared.<br> But I miss their spirit and their courage.<br> I think it's going to rain.<br> We'd better look for a place<br> to take shelter.<br> Peter, don't you think so?<br> What troubles you?<br> You've hardly said anything all morning.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Nazarius.<br> Are you very tired?<br> Oh, my mind is as heavy as my body.<br> There is something wrong,<br> with our people, perhaps.<br> I do not know.<br> It is at such times<br> I need our Lord's counsel.<br> There is within me a decision<br> that I cannot find.<br> If only he would speak to me, l...<br> Look, those treetops there,<br> they do not bend with the wind.<br> Yes, that is so.<br> And that sudden brightness coming,<br> do you see it, Nazarius?<br> It is the light of the Lord.<br> I have seen it.<br> Christ Jesus, you are here.<br> What is wrong, O Lord?<br> What should I do?<br> I am weary.<br> How should I follow thee now?<br> Whither goest thou, Lord?<br> My people in Rome have need of thee.<br> What did you say, Nazarius?<br> My people in Rome have need of thee.<br> If thou desert my people...<br> ...I shall go to Rome<br> to be crucified a second time.<br> Nazarius, blessed child, speak on.<br> Speak.<br> Oh, Peter, you've stumbled. Here.<br> The words you said, say them again.<br> I didn't say anything.<br> You said, "If thou desert my people...<br> ...I shall go to Rome<br> to be crucified a second time."<br> But I said nothing.<br> Yes.<br> He has again spoken to me.<br> Come, Nazarius.<br> Where are you going?<br> To Rome.<br> I have invited you here tonight,<br> my friends...<br> ...you who have been steadfast<br> through the years.<br> That you have come<br> proves not only your recklessness...<br> ...but your devotion.<br> You pay us too much respect.<br> We know you have the wit<br> to bring yourself into his favor again.<br> No.<br> Tigellinus has won.<br> Nero, our master...<br> ...is at the moment<br> anticipating how he will make me suffer.<br> But I shall deprive him of that pleasure.<br> This is an evening of farewells.<br> Where will you go, my lord?<br> Your lord?<br> You've called me that for long enough.<br> My name is Gaius.<br> And you've worn this emblem of slavery<br> for far too long.<br> Henceforth, you are legally free.<br> And this villa, with its treasures,<br> its slaves, its gardens, will be yours.<br> Why do you say this?<br> Because this evening,<br> with its warmth and feeling...<br> ...this evening is my signature.<br> The last flourish.<br> Tell the physician to come in.<br> It is not enough to live well.<br> One must die well.<br> No, my lord.<br> No. Please don't let him.<br> I understand the Christians say that<br> death is but a transition to a better life.<br> It will be interesting to discover.<br> Oh, my lord.<br> My dear, no tears before our guests.<br> Petronius...<br> If the Christians are right,<br> this will be but a brief parting.<br> We can't... We can't part.<br> Eunice.<br> Did you think I could live without you?<br> No, no. Bind her wrist.<br> For the first time, Gaius, I disobey you.<br> What have I done that forever I should<br> hear the sweet thunder of your heart?<br> You have given me your love.<br> And now, my friends,<br> I wish to write a letter to our emperor.<br> Scribe?<br> Will you permit me?<br> Let us hear it, Petronius.<br> To Nero, emperor of Rome...<br> ...master of the world, divine pontiff.<br> I know that my death<br> will be a disappointment to you...<br> ...since you wished to render me<br> this service yourself.<br> To be born in your reign<br> is a miscalculation...<br> ...but to die in it is a joy.<br> I can forgive you for murdering your wife<br> and your mother...<br> ...for burning our beloved Rome,<br> for befouling our fair country...<br> ...with the stench of your crimes.<br> But one thing I cannot forgive...<br> ...the boredom<br> of having to listen to your verses...<br> ...your second-rate songs,<br> your mediocre performances.<br> Adhere to your special gifts, Nero.<br> Murder and arson, betrayal and terror.<br> Mutilate your subjects, if you must.<br> But with my last breath, I beg you,<br> do not mutilate the arts.<br> Farewell, but compose no more music.<br> Brutalize the people...<br> ...but do not bore them...<br> ...as you have bored to death<br> your friend...<br> ...the late Gaius Petronius.<br> Seneca, I entrust to you<br> the delivery of this letter.<br> I will deliver it.<br> Farewell, Petronius.<br> With you perishes the best<br> of our Roman world.<br> Petronius?<br> Dead?<br> By his own hand?<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - I witnessed it, Divinity.<br> I shall never forgive him for this.<br> Never!<br> Without my permission?<br> It's rebellion.<br> It's blasphemy.<br> He left you a message of farewell.<br> Then he did think of me.<br> His last thoughts were of me.<br> How I loved you, Petronius.<br> You were my one friend.<br> You alone understood my soul.<br> Tigellinus, the weeping vase.<br> Who will listen to my songs now?<br> Who will appreciate<br> the true value of my verses?<br> I weep for you, Petronius.<br> One tear for you.<br> One for me.<br> Seal up these fruits of my sorrow...<br> ...so that posterity may know<br> how Nero grieved for his dearest friend...<br> ...and truest critic.<br> And now for his tender words.<br> Destroy!<br> Destroy his house, every stone to dust.<br> Burn his books.<br> Slaughter his animals.<br> Kill his servants.<br> Male, female, eunuch, every one of them.<br> Beat his memory into the ground!<br> Where is the emperor?<br> Let Nero start the game.<br> The lions are getting hungry.<br> Bring on those house burners.<br> They're crying for blood.<br> I doubt if we can chance anything today.<br> Nothing will change<br> the temper of this mob.<br> Have you heard any news<br> of the commander?<br> Only that he's been taken, that's all.<br> O holy gods of Rome...<br> ...in the name of Nero,<br> emperor and supreme pontiff...<br> ...we beseech you<br> to receive in sacrifice...<br> ...the lives<br> of those who sought to destroy...<br> ...this sacred and eternal city.<br> Have strength as he did.<br> It will not be long.<br> Oh, dear Lord Jesus, help them.<br> Help them.<br> Don't.<br> Don't torture yourself.<br> I'll be as close to her as I can.<br> You may give the signal, Divinity.<br> Peace to the martyrs!<br> Peter.<br> Peace, peace to them.<br> Take thy children, Lord.<br> Numb their wounds, soften their pains.<br> Give them strength, O savior.<br> Seize that man.<br> Blessed are you, my children,<br> who die in the name of Jesus.<br> I say to you that this day...<br> ...you shall be with him in paradise.<br> Here, where Nero rules today,<br> Christ shall rule forever.<br> Who is that man?<br> I think he is their leader,<br> a man called Peter.<br> He escaped us before.<br> But he said Christ would replace me.<br> What sort of...?<br> They're singing.<br> These dogs have effrontery even in death.<br> The lions will sing louder, I think.<br> Oh, Peter, could our Lord<br> at least not have saved you?<br> Oh, Peter, why did you come back?<br> It was the Lord's will.<br> Nazarius is safe.<br> Some good people sheltered him<br> outside the city.<br> Yes, sing to him<br> as he now opens his arms to you.<br> Sing to the welcome of Christ, our Lord.<br> More singing. Why aren't they afraid?<br> They irritate me.<br> They should have been tortured first,<br> their insolence destroyed.<br> What of Marcus Vinicius<br> and the girl Lygia?<br> - Shall we bring them after these?<br> - Yes.<br> Alone, with one lion.<br> - The hungriest.<br> - Not yet, my lord.<br> I should like Vinicius and his little flower<br> held in reserve.<br> I am planning something most unusual.<br> A surprise for you.<br> What is it, Poppaea? Tell me.<br> It will not be a surprise, then.<br> Please, Poppaea.<br> My lord, have I ever disappointed you<br> in conceiving new delights?<br> New thrills?<br> True.<br> You haven't.<br> Singing.<br> How can they?<br> It's beyond understanding.<br> Don't have the arena cleared<br> at the end of the day.<br> I'm most curious.<br> No face on this one at all.<br> Oh, look, there's another one smiling.<br> It's monstrous of them to die smiling.<br> It's inhuman.<br> Yet they look no different<br> from other people.<br> The man, Peter,<br> he put an evil spell on them.<br> Yes.<br> The man, Peter.<br> Something singular<br> must be done with him.<br> Marcus.<br> Yes?<br> Nothing do I see that is not perfection.<br> That night you said it, even though<br> you were most predatory about it...<br> ...even then,<br> my heart must have told me:<br> "That is the man you will love."<br> Only, then, you wouldn't let me hear<br> my heart talking, Marcus.<br> I said a great deal, I remember.<br> All of it loud and empty.<br> I would so love to have given you a son.<br> Lygia.<br> Oh, Marcus.<br> No matter what,<br> I want to be your wife now.<br> - Peter will say the words over us.<br> - Lygia, you know l...<br> I want it to be that way<br> before they take us...<br> ...so that it will be that way<br> when we are together again.<br> You would never wish me to pretend,<br> would you?<br> Pretend?<br> That I feel myself Christian.<br> It's still strange, new.<br> There's something I can't quite...<br> I mean...<br> Yes, it's proven good...<br> ...full of courage, right here.<br> But there are many things<br> I cannot believe, understand.<br> Christ is within you, Marcus.<br> You feel him more strongly<br> than you know.<br> Come.<br> Peter.<br> Before I die, I want to marry Marcus.<br> This is a holy thing, my son.<br> It concerns Lygia.<br> I look upon it as holy.<br> Marcus.<br> Lygia.<br> May he who blessed<br> the marriage at Cana bless you also.<br> Love one another<br> from this moment forward...<br> ...as man and wife in his holy name.<br> In the name of the Father and of the Son<br> and of the Holy Ghost.<br> In this life and the next...<br> ...now and forevermore.<br> Marcus.<br> My husband.<br> Here he is, Your Majesty.<br> He meets with your approval?<br> Very much so.<br> It will be like a fresco from Crete.<br> The maiden sacrificed to the Minotaur.<br> It will be a spectacle<br> worthy of the eyes of the emperor.<br> Superb conception.<br> You seem sad and restless,<br> my little black friend.<br> But do not grieve.<br> I promise you a rare playmate<br> for your lonely horns...<br> ...to fondle and caress.<br> You are the man Peter?<br> I am Simon, called Peter.<br> "The man called Peter has been heard<br> to preach rebellion and blasphemy...<br> ...against the rule<br> and the divinity of the emperor.<br> It is accordingly decreed<br> that he be taken to Vatican Hill...<br> ...where it has been confessed<br> he made his first preachment...<br> ...to be crucified and left there<br> as a warning to all and any...<br> ...who henceforth<br> wish to call themselves Christians."<br> To die as our Lord died<br> is more than I deserve.<br> We can change that.<br> You'll notice, Divinity,<br> they've stopped singing.<br> They have, haven't they?<br> I seem to know that man.<br> General Plautius.<br> He conquered Parthia<br> and the north countries...<br> ...when you were a boy.<br> Rome made him famous,<br> and he repaid her with treason.<br> What a dramatic reversal.<br> Now he faces his first defeat.<br> I shall write a poem.<br> People of Rome.<br> I am Aulus Plautius...<br> ...once general of your armies.<br> Rome is ruled by a monster...<br> ...who tells you<br> the Christians burned Rome.<br> But he lies.<br> You lie, Nero.<br> You are the incendiary.<br> Nero kills Christians to deceive you.<br> He alone is guilty.<br> I swear it by my death and by my...<br> I begin to envy Petronius.<br> I have envied him long since.<br> I tell you,<br> this is a horrible blot on Roman justice.<br> The mob isn't as happy as it was.<br> Have you noticed?<br> Save me.<br> They are singing.<br> He said something to Nero.<br> I could not hear the words.<br> Nero's looking at a man<br> that knows how to die.<br> Take him.<br> Commander?<br> They're not parting us.<br> Prepare her.<br> Here, my lord, is our honored guest.<br> Vinicius?<br> - Why is he not in the arena?<br> - He will be, very much so.<br> In spirit.<br> It's a giant.<br> It's Hercules himself.<br> He has guarded the Lygian girl<br> from birth.<br> Now let us see him<br> guard her from death.<br> But what is the contest?<br> Look.<br> They've brought Marcus here<br> to face this.<br> By the...<br> Do not fret, Vinicius.<br> Remember, I said I did not hate her.<br> I wish her no pain.<br> Lasting pain, that is.<br> I am devastated dear Petronius<br> is not here...<br> ...to witness our pleasure, Vinicius.<br> "Sing no more," he said.<br> Upon these lilies I heap now<br> Red roses upon red<br> A blood-red tide shall surge<br> Upon her milk-white flesh<br> Like your uncle,<br> you do have a certain amount of taste.<br> But I still think<br> that she's too narrow in the hips.<br> These people know how to die, Nero.<br> In death, you will squeal like a hog.<br> Give him the sword. Let him...<br> No, stay.<br> My lord, would you deprive him<br> of his final pleasure?<br> Ha!<br> Superb, Poppaea. Magnificent.<br> A fair contest.<br> Nero's justice is proverbial.<br> If the bull kills the giant,<br> so much for the girl.<br> But if our Hercules should be cruel enough<br> to destroy the poor animal...<br> ...I shall have to spare her life<br> for Vinicius.<br> To breed more Christians.<br> Christ.<br> Christ, give him strength.<br> Seize him.<br> - Burner of Rome!<br> - Thumbs up!<br> - Burner of Rome!<br> - Thumbs up!<br> Ready up there? First line, follow me.<br> Citizens of Rome.<br> I am Marcus Vinicius...<br> ...commander of your 14th Legion.<br> This man who burned Rome...<br> ...who killed innocents<br> for his own crime...<br> ...the rule of this madman is ended.<br> Rome is yours again.<br> Tonight, General Galba<br> marches from the north.<br> Your army has risen.<br> Hail Galba.<br> Galba, new emperor of Rome.<br> - A sword from Plautius.<br> - Aah!<br> Where are the Praetorian Guard?<br> Dead or in revolt.<br> Dead, all dead.<br> My dear mother.<br> Octavia, the wife I loved.<br> My friend Petronius, all dead.<br> Dead.<br> You alone are left.<br> Kill the Christians, you said.<br> It was you.<br> It was you who turned my people...<br> ...my faithful subjects...<br> ...against me.<br> You are my evil genius.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I banished you.
