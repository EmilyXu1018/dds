                        Becca?<br> Becca?<br> - Hey, Peg.<br> - It looks so nice back here.<br> Well, I'm just, you know,<br> trying to get things back into shape.<br> Listen, we were wondering<br> if you and Howie were free tonight.<br> - We're having a few people over for dinner.<br> - That's very sweet of you, Peg.<br> - I know, it's really short notice...<br> - Actually, we have plans.<br> But another time, though?<br> Yeah, I haven't talked to Pete in ages.<br> You haven't missed much.<br> He's still the same SOB he always was.<br> Oh, God. I'm so sorry.<br> - It's okay.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - No, no, no. No, it's fine.<br> - These stupid feet.<br> Well, have a great dinner, Peg.<br> - We'll do it again next time.<br> - Yeah. Absolutely.<br> - Say hi to Howie for me.<br> - I sure will.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Smells good in there.<br> - Hey, if Peg asks, we went out tonight.<br> Where did we go?<br> - Saw the Stoppard play.<br> - Really? Did we enjoy it?<br> Very much.<br> She asked us to dinner again.<br> - She's just being nice.<br> - You're more than welcome to go over there.<br> - And abandon your risotto?<br> - Careful, Howie. The pan's hot.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey. I'm gonna hop in the shower.<br> About 20 minutes.<br> Hello?<br> What time is it?<br> What's going on?<br> Thank you.<br> - Have you got nothing to say?<br> - Thank you?<br> - You were in a bar fight.<br> - It wasn't a bar fight.<br> - You were in a bar fighting.<br> - It wasn't a fight.<br> Some drunk girl was screaming in my face,<br> so I hit her and that was the end of it.<br> - Well, who was she?<br> - I don't know.<br> People don't just scream at you<br> for no reason.<br> Sure they do! You should get out more.<br> - God, Izzy, it's so Jerry Springer.<br> - What does that mean?<br> What, do you think I'm trashy?<br> You can't keep doing this.<br> You're not a kid anymore.<br> I didn't know there was a cut-off date.<br> Yeah, for acting like a jackass,<br> there's a cut-off date.<br> I want to stop worrying about you.<br> Hey, don't worry about me.<br> She was the one on the floor.<br> Can I stay with you tonight?<br> I got you! I got you!<br> Danny, look at me when you turn back.<br> - He's getting juice.<br> - No, he's not.<br> Danny, look at this.<br> Now, Danny,<br> I'm gonna tell you a secret, okay?<br> When you go back down,<br> I want you to give Mom a big kiss, okay?<br> Ready? One, two, three. That was high!<br> - Danny, look at me when you come back.<br> - He's getting juice.<br> - You want any cake?<br> - Yes.<br> Do we have cake today?<br> - Yeah, we do.<br> - Yes.<br> - We do?<br> - No, it's brownies. Come on.<br> Oh, my gosh. You really want some.<br> Well, if it isn't Ma Barker.<br> I'm sure that would be very funny<br> if I knew who that was.<br> Rick and I are gonna play squash.<br> I have my cell if you need me.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Squash. You go play squash, Howie.<br> - You don't even know what squash is.<br> - I don't care what squash is.<br> Hello?<br> Yeah. Yeah!<br> She's gonna kill me.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> I think Auggie must have told her.<br> Hey, I gotta go. Bye.<br> Thank you, Becca.<br> I know what this stuff is now.<br> - I like the way it cracks.<br> - Of course you do.<br> So, did you know that woman?<br> My God, why are you listening<br> to my phone conversations?<br> - You're sleeping with the girl's boyfriend.<br> - It's been over between them!<br> They're just living together<br> because of the rent.<br> - Then why did she accost you?<br> - Because she's a lunatic.<br> And Auggie must have told her<br> that I'm pregnant.<br> - You are not.<br> - You're gonna love him.<br> He's a really...<br> He's a great guy. He's a musician.<br> - Well, that's terrific.<br> - Yeah, he works.<br> He gets work as a musician.<br> - How long have you known?<br> - A few weeks.<br> Did you tell Mom?<br> Come on. You told Mom before me?<br> - I had to.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> Why do you think?<br> I'm sorry, Becca.<br> I know the timing really sucks.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> I'm just glad you finally told me.<br> Debbie has been driving me crazy<br> with these kitchen renovations.<br> I tell you, the countertop<br> negotiations alone.<br> I told you not to marry an agent.<br> She still hasn't called, you know.<br> No, I know.<br> I mean, I don't mean to be a pest about it,<br> but I just know Becca<br> would love to hear from her.<br> I know. I tell her, Howie, I do.<br> But she's still...<br> I don't know. Freaked out, I guess.<br> - It's been eight months.<br> - I know. I'll talk to her.<br> Thank you. Hey, how are the kids?<br> They're good.<br> Emily's doing ballet. Robbie is in T-ball.<br> T-ball.<br> Hey, have you guys talked at all<br> about having another?<br> No.<br> No, it's a little soon.<br> - Just be a little open. That's<br> all I'm asking. - I'm here, aren't I?<br> - Hey.<br> - How's it going?<br> Good, good. We're hanging in there.<br> - You sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey, Kevin.<br> - Hi. Hi.<br> Yeah, we... We just...<br> We found out<br> that Becca's sister is pregnant, so...<br> - Howie.<br> - What?<br> That can be hard.<br> I remember when my cousin got pregnant.<br> Yeah, it's not really a big deal.<br> Okay.<br> If you want to talk about it, though,<br> you know, the group's here, so...<br> Yeah, no, I don't think so.<br> - "Hey, everybody, fresh meat."<br> - Becca, be nice.<br> Doesn't she remind you of Lydia?<br> There was this woman in our group<br> a couple of years ago.<br> It was four. Four years ago.<br> You know,<br> it doesn't really matter when she was here.<br> My point is, is that<br> she reminds me of Lydia.<br> She really wasn't<br> into the support-group model at first.<br> - So, how long have you been in group?<br> - It'll be eight years in June.<br> I didn't... I didn't<br> realize it was that long.<br> You know, we're the veterans.<br> You know, for us it's...<br> It's a good way to touch base.<br> Everyone's on a different schedule.<br> Of course. Of course.<br> She... You know,<br> she visits me sometimes in dreams<br> and she tells me it's okay,<br> that she's with God.<br> And we had some good days,<br> and you think that when you have enough<br> good days, it actually is gonna get better.<br> You know, it does get better and then...<br> - It was her anniversary last week and...<br> - A year last Tuesday.<br> And it just starts all over again.<br> We just have to remind each other that...<br> - It's just part of God's plan.<br> - Yeah.<br> And we can't know why.<br> You know, only God can know why.<br> God had to take her.<br> He needed another angel.<br> He needed another angel.<br> Why didn't he just make one?<br> Another angel.<br> I mean, he's God, after all.<br> Why didn't he just make another angel?<br> Just...<br> Just putting it out there.<br> I'd like to go.<br> I think we're gonna go.<br> Is that all right, honey?<br> Excuse us.<br> They're talking, it's their time,<br> and you have to respect that.<br> - Come on.<br> - I mean, you sit there for weeks<br> and you don't say a word...<br> I'm sorry. I can't stand the God freaks.<br> You know that.<br> But they're not all like that.<br> Kevin and Gaby aren't.<br> No. Kevin and Gaby<br> are professional wallowers.<br> I mean, come on. Eight years, Howie. Eight.<br> If that's what you want to become, then...<br> - If you want to take a break...<br> - No, not a break. I'm done.<br> - I know that Izzy stuff got under<br> your skin. - Please don't do that. Please.<br> One semester of psychology 15 years ago<br> and suddenly you can analyze...<br> Jesus, Becca.<br> I don't like the group.<br> - I gave it a try. It's not for me.<br> - Okay.<br> It's not for you.<br> Thank you.<br> Do you mind if we not eat here,<br> 'cause nothing's really jumping out at me.<br> Taz! Stop, stop. Come here and eat.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Stay. Sorry, he's not really dangerous. Eat.<br> - Yeah.<br> - He's just kind of dumb.<br> No, I know. He's my dog.<br> You're Becca.<br> I should have recognized you, of course.<br> I'm Auggie.<br> - Hi, Auggie.<br> - Hi.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> you were coming over?<br> I would have picked up the house.<br> - That's Auggie.<br> - Yeah, we met. Is Izzy here?<br> Yeah, she's here.<br> She got fired from Applebee's.<br> I was planning on taking<br> it all down to Goodwill,<br> but now I'm glad that I didn't,<br> because look at these shirts.<br> Look at them. And these sweaters...<br> I don't know, Becca.<br> I mean, they're in baby clothes for so long.<br> It'll probably be a while<br> before he can even fit into that stuff.<br> No. It comes up very quickly, you'll see.<br> You're gonna be happy that I saved it.<br> - Is he living here?<br> - He has to. His girlfriend kicked him out.<br> - Ex-girlfriend.<br> - She knows what I meant.<br> - Did you see this one?<br> - That's cute. Look at that.<br> What if it's a girl?<br> Well, then...<br> I don't know, I'll give it to someone else.<br> But you're gonna... You're gonna thank me.<br> There's a couple of years' worth<br> of clothes here.<br> Think of all the money you're gonna save.<br> - It's not about the money.<br> - Well, it should be.<br> Come on, Izzy.<br> You gotta start thinking about that.<br> I mean, especially if the dad's a musician. It<br> costs a lot to raise a child, I'm telling you.<br> It would just be weird, Becca,<br> if it was a boy, to see him running around<br> in Danny's clothes.<br> I would just feel weird about it.<br> Yeah.<br> - I'm sorry. Of course it would be weird.<br> - It was a nice offer.<br> You're gonna get a lot of clothes.<br> Christmas, birthdays.<br> - You don't have anything to worry about.<br> - It's probably a girl, anyway.<br> You know,<br> I'm a little psychic about these things.<br> Remember, I said Sheila was having a girl?<br> And Karin!<br> - I think there's a girl in there.<br> - I hope there is. I mean, I want a girl.<br> I want it to be healthy, obviously,<br> but I really hope it's a girl.<br> Me, too.<br> You want some coffee cake?<br> I've got some coffee cake for us.<br> I'm actually gonna take off<br> because I promised Howie<br> that I'd pick up some dinner.<br> Looks good, though.<br> Here. Eat some cake.<br> - When did Rick ever beat me at squash?<br> - Did he mention Debbie at all?<br> You can call her, you know.<br> Get the reports directly.<br> I don't want to call<br> her. She should call me.<br> I would have been there for her if anything<br> had ever happened to Robbie or Em.<br> I wouldn't have vanished the way she did.<br> I wouldn't.<br> Howie?<br> You know what I mean?<br> Yeah.<br> Howie.<br> Turn around.<br> Come on. You need to relax.<br> - Your shoulders are all knotted up.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Forget about Debbie<br> and whatever else is bothering you.<br> I know what this is. Dimming the lights...<br> You're trying to seduce me.<br> You're plying me with... With liquor.<br> It worked in college.<br> That's enough. That's enough.<br> Where are you going?<br> No, I just... I'm feeling antsy tonight.<br> I'm sorry. It just... It was a weird day.<br> - Right.<br> - What, now you're gonna pout?<br> - It's been eight months.<br> - But who's keeping track?<br> I am. I'm keeping track.<br> I'm not ready yet, Howie.<br> All right? I'm just...<br> I'm sorry if you think that that's abnormal.<br> I don't.<br> I don't think it's abnormal at all, but...<br> So, what's the problem?<br> We need to at least head in that direction,<br> which might feel strange at first, but...<br> - But you want to have sex.<br> - Don't say it like that.<br> - You're trying to rope me into having sex.<br> - I am not. I wasn't roping you into sex.<br> - Al Green isn't roping?<br> - No.<br> - Al Green?<br> - I thought it was nice. That's all.<br> I was trying to make things nice.<br> You can't. You just can't, all right?<br> I'm sorry. Things aren't nice anymore.<br> Babe, will you hold him for a second?<br> Just hold him like that.<br> - Taz, quit it.<br> - Yeah, tell Taz to quit it.<br> - All right. Now...<br> - 'Cause Taz wants to go on the tire.<br> - Hold on. Let me see Mama and...<br> - Okay, you ready? I'm gonna let you go.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yes.<br> Here it goes. There!<br> - Keep your feet up.<br> - Danny.<br> - Look at me on the way back, Danny.<br> - Keep your feet up, Danny.<br> Hey.<br> If you're not gonna go to group,<br> I need you to see someone.<br> - Any plans for the day?<br> - You're looking at them.<br> - I'll see you tonight.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm here to see Scott Baiter<br> in the Events department.<br> I don't have a Baiter listed.<br> That's weird.<br> - Kate Finn. What about Kate?<br> - I have a Robert Finn in Dec Arts.<br> If you have an appointment,<br> I can just call up there.<br> Who are you?<br> I... I don't have an appointment. I...<br> I'm an old friend. I used to work here.<br> Becca?<br> - Gary!<br> - Hey! What are you doing here?<br> I had some errands to<br> run in the city and I...<br> I thought I'd pop in and say hello,<br> but apparently nobody works here anymore.<br> Yeah, no, Scott went over to Christie's<br> back in March. Traitor.<br> It's good to see<br> you're still doing the coffee runs, though.<br> No. No, no, no. I don't usually.<br> I'm in Scott's old job.<br> - Hey, how's the family?<br> - You know what, Gary, I...<br> I know how busy it gets up there,<br> so I'm gonna let you get back to it.<br> Yeah, that hasn't changed.<br> - It was great to see you, though.<br> - You, too.<br> - There are fines, you know?<br> - No, I know.<br> The book's quite overdue.<br> We sent out several notices.<br> - Yeah, that's why I'm here.<br> - $7.00.<br> Thank you.<br> Can I help you?<br> Yeah, actually. Would it be possible<br> for me to check this out?<br> Certainly.<br> "I will become a fish in a trout stream<br> and I will swim away from you."<br> - He's an iguana.<br> - Yeah, he is.<br> "'If you become a fish in a trout stream,'<br> said his mother,<br> "'I will become a fisherman<br> and I will fish for you..."'<br> Sorry.<br> What do you think's gonna happen?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Let's see.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> I just scored Yankee tickets off of Rowan.<br> Tonight. You interested?<br> - I can't. I got group.<br> - You can't skip one night?<br> They're right behind home plate.<br> - Another time.<br> - If there is one.<br> - You going stag tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> No. Becca, she's...<br> She's gonna take a little break.<br> From the group.<br> I'm gonna get a coffee.<br> - Want to sit?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hi, Mom. It's me.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Nothing.<br> I was thinking about making Izzy's<br> birthday cake. Would that be all right?<br> Honey, you don't have to do all that.<br> I was just gonna grab her<br> one of those Carvel things. She likes those.<br> I don't mind. I really don't.<br> I mean, it will give me something to do.<br> Okay, okay.<br> No group tonight?<br> Howie's there. It's too<br> much God talk for me.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing. It's just that...<br> You know,<br> some people find that comforting.<br> Yeah, well, it pisses me off.<br> You know, Becca, when your brother died,<br> I found the church very helpful.<br> I know. I know you did, but that's you.<br> That's not me, and Danny...<br> Danny isn't Arthur.<br> You know,<br> I brought you to church every Sunday.<br> Let's not start this again, okay, Mom?<br> I'm just... I'm just calling about the cake.<br> You're not right about everything,<br> you know?<br> - What if there is a God?<br> - Then I'd say he's a sadistic prick.<br> - All right, Becca, that's enough.<br> - "Worship me and I'll treat you like shit."<br> No wonder you like him.<br> He sounds just like Dad.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're gonna do the cake, then?<br> Yeah.<br> All right, I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Who has a birthday party<br> in a bowling alley, anyway?<br> I mean, Izzy thinks she's still 14.<br> If you're not up for<br> this, we don't have to go.<br> No, it's just a party. I'm fine.<br> I wish you'd take that thing out of here.<br> We're hardly in this car.<br> What's the difference?<br> It's weird. It feels weird.<br> What if we gave it another try?<br> - What?<br> - Another baby?<br> I mean, we're not getting any younger.<br> Is that what the sex thing<br> was about the other night?<br> - No.<br> - You're trying to get me pregnant.<br> Becca, no, of course not.<br> I know it's scary, but maybe it might<br> - help us get back on track.<br> - On track?<br> What, we can't talk about it?<br> I think we should sell the house.<br> I've been thinking about it,<br> and since we're on the topic...<br> What? What do you mean?<br> How are we on the topic?<br> I talked to a realtor,<br> and she thinks we can pull together...<br> - What do you mean, talked to a realtor?<br> ...an open house pretty quickly, and then...<br> Why would you talk to a realtor<br> without telling me?<br> I'm telling you now.<br> You want us to get back on track,<br> I think it would help if we moved.<br> - We love that house.<br> - He's everywhere, Howie.<br> I can see his fingerprints on the door jams.<br> - I see puzzles, I see his highchair.<br> - I like seeing his fingerprints.<br> Yeah, but that's because you don't have<br> to sit and stare at it all day.<br> You get to go to work. You get to escape.<br> - Yeah, but I don't want to move!<br> - I don't want another baby!<br> Jesus!<br> - What are you doing?<br> - What do you think I'm doing?<br> I just had to check the cake. It's fine.<br> Are you kidding? The Kennedys?<br> With the assassinations<br> and the lobotomies?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Right here.<br> Yeah. That's not a curse, though.<br> - It's just bad luck.<br> - The plane crashes?<br> Too much money. That's their curse.<br> If those Kennedys lived like normal people,<br> most of them would still be alive.<br> I think it's sad.<br> All those good-looking people<br> falling out of the sky like that.<br> It's a frigging waste.<br> - Didn't I say no wine?<br> - She brought it herself.<br> Isn't this nice? Just sitting<br> around talking politics like this?<br> I never do this. It's a nice change.<br> - Let's do gifts.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yeah, gifts!<br> - All right!<br> - Yes!<br> - Okay.<br> - It's heavy.<br> - So pretty. I hate to ruin it, but I will.<br> It's a bathroom set.<br> More of a practical gift.<br> Is this your way of telling me you don't<br> like my Three Stooges shower curtain?<br> - I didn't know what to get you, so...<br> - Seriously, it's great.<br> - Say thank you.<br> - Thank you, Becca. Thank you, Howie.<br> - Don't thank me, Becca picked it out.<br> - Now me.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I know it's a little early, but...<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - Lovely.<br> So sweet. Thank you, Mama.<br> I thought we weren't doing baby stuff<br> for the birthday.<br> I thought we were doing it...<br> We were waiting for the shower.<br> No, honey, it's not baby stuff,<br> it's mommy stuff.<br> This is perfect, Bec.<br> I needed a bathroom set.<br> - Yeah, but you need baby stuff more.<br> - We can take it back.<br> - That's right, we should.<br> - No.<br> I'm gonna get you a basket<br> of Mustela lotions.<br> - They prevent stretch marks.<br> - No. Becca, let it go.<br> You can get me the lotion another time.<br> - No, come on.<br> - You can get me the lotion another time!<br> I got it, I got it. It's<br> okay. It's all right.<br> - I didn't...<br> - Thank you. Thank you, Becca.<br> Here.<br> I just remembered what I was gonna say<br> about Aristotle Onassis.<br> It was about the son<br> who died in a plane crash.<br> Are you ready to go?<br> You should have stopped him<br> from going off<br> on all that Kennedy stuff,<br> because my point was Onassis<br> and how he put up a reward<br> to anyone who could prove<br> that someone had sabotaged<br> his son's plane.<br> He was so desperate to blame somebody.<br> Did you read this?<br> - He needed a reason for losing his son.<br> - Mom, why are you telling this story?<br> - I'm just talking. I can't talk?<br> - You never just talk.<br> You guys, thanks for coming to my party.<br> Becca, the cake was so good.<br> You forget what I went through<br> when your brother died.<br> You think I don't know anything,<br> but I do, Becca.<br> - Like who to blame?<br> - Guys, please. It's my birthday party.<br> - No, let it go. That's their stuff.<br> - No, I'm not talking about blame.<br> - I'm talking about comfort.<br> - Comfort.<br> - Where are you getting it?<br> - Comfort? I'm not.<br> Well, I think you should.<br> Okay, well, let me get on that<br> and see what I can dig up on eBay.<br> I'm just trying to help you, Becca.<br> You know, I wish somebody had given me<br> a little advice when Arthur died.<br> You know what I wish?<br> I wish you would stop comparing Danny<br> to Arthur.<br> - Becca.<br> - Danny was a 4-year-old boy<br> who chased his dog into the street,<br> and Arthur was a 30-year-old heroin addict<br> who OD'd.<br> Frankly, I resent<br> how you keep lumping them together, Mom.<br> He was still my son.<br> We're gonna go.<br> I hope you enjoy the bathroom set, Izzy.<br> I'm gonna.<br> When Arthur died<br> I was just as upset as she was,<br> but I didn't take it out on other people.<br> What about Mrs. Bailey?<br> Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey.<br> - Hey, did you call that guy about the roof?<br> - No, I couldn't find the number.<br> Becca, it's in my phone. It's on the mantle.<br> What's his name?<br> It's not under his name.<br> Then how am I supposed to call him if I...<br> - It's under "roof guy."<br> - "Roof guy."<br> - Well, what was I supposed to put it under?<br> - I don't know how to use this.<br> - It doesn't...<br> - No. Okay, now scroll down.<br> - Now what? You do it.<br> - Scroll down with your finger.<br> - Roof guy.<br> - Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Are you waiting for me?<br> Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.<br> I thought that you took the bus.<br> - I do.<br> - But not today.<br> Not today. I skipped school.<br> Well, you shouldn't be playing hooky,<br> young man.<br> Why are you waiting for me?<br> I thought we could talk.<br> About what?<br> - Is this okay?<br> - Yeah, it's fine.<br> - Not too weird?<br> - No.<br> I mean...<br> No, I know, it's...<br> It's weird for me, too.<br> - Don't you like school?<br> - I like it all right.<br> I just thought 'cause you... I don't<br> know, you seem to not be going, so...<br> I've been accepted to college already, so...<br> - Not a big deal, then.<br> - No, it is a big deal,<br> but only if my mother finds out.<br> She said she would confiscate my phone<br> if I did it again.<br> Not that I use my phone anyway.<br> - So, where are you headed?<br> - Connecticut College.<br> Right. That's a good school. Not far.<br> I bet your parents are pleased<br> that you're gonna be close by.<br> It's just my mom, but, yeah,<br> she's pretty happy about it.<br> She keeps saying she's gonna apply<br> to the grad program<br> so she can keep an eye on me<br> while I'm up there.<br> - She's just joking, though.<br> - Yeah.<br> She's not really looking forward to it,<br> 'cause I'm the only one at home now,<br> but I told her I'd come home<br> on the weekends and stuff if I could.<br> Well, that'll be nice.<br> So...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I know.<br> - You don't have to...<br> - I know that doesn't help.<br> No, it does, it really does, but...<br> - I know I should have<br> tried to get in touch... - It's fine.<br> I just really wish I had driven down<br> a different block that day.<br> I know.<br> You know, I should maybe go.<br> It's all right.<br> No, I gotta... My mom's gonna start<br> to wonder where I'm at.<br> It's okay. You really don't have to. It's...<br> Can we do this again sometime?<br> Sure.<br> Okay.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> - Hey, Gaby.<br> - I can't... I know.<br> God, I can't believe<br> you just saw me do that.<br> I didn't mean to sneak up on you.<br> I thought something was wrong,<br> but, obviously, everything smells fine.<br> You can smell it, huh? God.<br> - Everyone in there's gonna know.<br> - Nah.<br> - I swear I never do this.<br> - Where's Kevin?<br> He's not coming to group.<br> And I blame your wife, by the way,<br> 'cause I think she put the idea in his head.<br> Yeah, well, he didn't really seem<br> to like group all that much.<br> God, you know, he's got me so upset.<br> I mean, like, look at me. I'm... I'm...<br> I am smoking pot in a parking lot.<br> It's like I'm in high school. It's...<br> I'm ridiculous.<br> You got any more?<br> Yeah.<br> Come on in, partner.<br> Well, if today is rage day,<br> most of you know that I'm a little bit<br> more comfortable with rage,<br> talking about rage.<br> I deal with rage every single day.<br> I listen to guys at work going on and on<br> about paving their driveways or whatever.<br> Stupid nonsense.<br> They don't know. They haven't<br> had their lives ripped apart yet.<br> - They're not in the club.<br> - Exactly.<br> Meanwhile, I'm like,<br> "Hey, guys, my daughter died of leukemia."<br> I'm sorry. I have to get some water.<br> You're one of those bad kids<br> my mother warned me about.<br> Yes, yeah, I am corrupting you.<br> But don't worry, I won't tell Becca.<br> I'd appreciate that.<br> - Bye.<br> - Good night.<br> Becca?<br> - Becca? What'd you do here?<br> - What?<br> - God damn it.<br> - What?<br> - What'd you do to my phone?<br> - Jesus, Howie, I thought something had...<br> This morning, when you used it,<br> what did you do to my phone?<br> Nothing, I just...<br> - I just got the number for the roof guy.<br> - For God's sake.<br> - What? You told me to call him.<br> - You deleted Danny's video.<br> No. No, I didn't. No.<br> I just... You were right there.<br> I just got the number.<br> Yeah, and you kept pressing the screen.<br> Because I couldn't figure out<br> how to use your phone.<br> - I checked already, it's gone.<br> - We have 100 videos of him.<br> That's not the point, Becca.<br> Then... Then you should<br> have put it on your computer.<br> - Right, right, it's my fault.<br> - I didn't say that.<br> - I said it's gone!<br> - Jesus, Howie! I didn't do it on purpose!<br> - Are you sure?<br> - What does that mean?<br> What, you think I deliberately<br> deleted his video?<br> I don't know.<br> - You don't know?<br> - It's like you're trying to get rid of him.<br> I'm sorry, but that's how it feels.<br> Every day it's something new.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's like you're trying to get rid<br> of any evidence he was ever here.<br> - What? You took the paintings<br> off the fridge. - To save them.<br> - To save them. They are<br> in a box downstairs. - Okay, his clothes.<br> We don't need all that stuff, Howie.<br> We just don't.<br> You wanting to sell the house.<br> Your sending Taz to your mother's.<br> There's a lot going on.<br> The dog got underfoot.<br> - Right. And he was a reminder.<br> - Yes, yes, he is a reminder.<br> - And since you never wanted the dog...<br> - I wanted one less reminder. For God's sake.<br> If I hadn't bought the dog,<br> Danny would still be alive.<br> If I hadn't have run back in to get<br> the phone, if I had latched that gate...<br> I left the gate unlatched!<br> Come on, I'm not playing this game again,<br> Howie, I'm not!<br> - It's no one's fault, and I'm not...<br> - Not even the dog's!<br> Dogs chase squirrels! Boys chase dogs!<br> - I know that.<br> - He loved that dog and you got rid of it!<br> Just like I'm getting rid of the video, huh?<br> It's not about the video, Becca.<br> It's not about the video!<br> It's not just the video,<br> it's about Taz and the paintings<br> and his clothes and everything!<br> There's no pictures of him around!<br> There's no fingerprints! There's nothing!<br> God damn it!<br> You have to stop erasing him!<br> You have to stop it!<br> Do you really think that I don't see him<br> every second of every day?<br> The video was an accident, Howie,<br> and believe me,<br> I will beat myself up about it forever,<br> I'm sure,<br> just like everything else<br> I could have prevented.<br> - That's not what I want, Becca.<br> - No? Because it feels like it is.<br> It feels like maybe<br> I don't feel badly enough for you.<br> Maybe I'm not feeling enough.<br> What do you want from me?<br> Something's got to change, because this...<br> I can't do this like this anymore. It's...<br> It's too hard. It's too hard.<br> And I want that dog back.<br> - Your mother's making him fat.<br> - Howie.<br> I miss the dog.<br> I'm sorry, but I miss him. I want him back.<br> - Did you really make these?<br> - I did.<br> That's good.<br> - They're still warm.<br> - I'm glad you like them.<br> I've been reading that book,<br> the parallel universe book.<br> Yeah? Did you like it?<br> Yeah. It's interesting.<br> I don't know if I buy it,<br> the whole alternate reality thing, I just...<br> I don't know.<br> But it's interesting.<br> - Did you have to do it<br> for a school project? - No, it's research.<br> Research?<br> It's a comic book.<br> It's impressive.<br> - Did you do all of this?<br> - Yeah.<br> Wow. It's amazing.<br> - What's it about?<br> - A scientist, I guess, and his son. The...<br> The father discovers this network of holes<br> that leads to other galaxies and...<br> - Parallel universes.<br> - Yeah, and, well, the scientist dies,<br> so the son has to go into this rabbit hole<br> to try and find him,<br> but it's not him because he's dead,<br> so it's, like, another version of him.<br> It's kind of stupid.<br> - No.<br> - No? Okay.<br> Not at all. I would love to read it.<br> Yeah, it's... Sorry. It's not... It's not<br> done yet, but when it is done, I will...<br> I will let you read it.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.<br> I... I...<br> I might have been going too fast<br> on that day.<br> I mean, I'm not sure, but I might have been,<br> so that's something<br> I've been wanting to tell you.<br> It's a 30 zone,<br> and I might have been going 31 or 32.<br> I usually look down and check,<br> and if I'm going over<br> then I would slow down, obviously,<br> but I don't remember checking<br> on your block.<br> So, it's possible<br> that I was going too fast and...<br> And... Well, the dog ran out really fast,<br> you know?<br> So I swerved. I didn't know.<br> I didn't know.<br> I thought you should know,<br> I might have been going<br> a little over the limit,<br> and I can't be positive.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Yeah.<br> All right.<br> Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> I don't want to go in there.<br> Yes, yes, yes!<br> - I'm sorry. It was...<br> - Be nice.<br> - My God.<br> - Come on.<br> - I'm sorry, you suck.<br> - I would be doing better,<br> but your pot messed up<br> my depth perception.<br> - All right.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm gonna support that one.<br> I'm totally gonna support that one.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey. You know what?<br> I have a confession to make.<br> - Remember when I said Kevin left group?<br> - Yeah.<br> What I meant to say was<br> he left me.<br> He left me.<br> Yeah, I...<br> I came home and he was gone.<br> - God, no note or...<br> - No. God, there was a note. Well, not...<br> Not a note so much as a manifesto<br> on all the ways<br> that we were destroying each other.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I mean, this is how it<br> generally goes, right?<br> It changes you. It literally changes people.<br> You know,<br> a part of me thinks it was inevitable.<br> I love my wife.<br> Of course you do.<br> I love her very much.<br> Okay.<br> I... I think you're right. We should maybe<br> look into selling the house.<br> It's probably for the best.<br> Okay.<br> Don't do that. Quick as a Band-Aid<br> or we'll never get through this. Here.<br> Hi, kids.<br> Welcome to the light-up alphabet apple.<br> - Hi, kids...<br> - I don't know how to turn it off.<br> Only people without children<br> give gifts like this.<br> - Come on. Come on. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> I hope you'll visit again soon.<br> - So, have you heard from Debbie yet?<br> - Nope.<br> That's too bad.<br> Although, it can be worse the other way.<br> You know, I remember when Arthur died...<br> You can say his name.<br> - Can I?<br> - Yes.<br> You know, I don't know your rules.<br> I don't want to get scolded again.<br> You can talk about Arthur.<br> I just don't like the comparisons.<br> Okay.<br> - So, how's it worse?<br> - You remember Maureen Bailey?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, I couldn't get rid of her<br> after your brother passed away.<br> - She was always at the house.<br> - Yeah, I remember that.<br> Yeah, well, you know,<br> I never had a moment to myself,<br> so finally,<br> in the middle of coffee one afternoon,<br> I said, "Maureen, why are you always here?"<br> - And what'd she say?<br> - She said,<br> "I want to be there, Nat.<br> I want to share in your grief."<br> And I said, "Well, it's not working.<br> "You plant your fat ass in that chair<br> every fricking day."<br> You did not say that!<br> - I did.<br> - Mom!<br> - I did say that.<br> - You said "fat ass"?<br> She sucks up all my coffee.<br> "And I don't see you leaving with any<br> of this alleged grief you're sharing.<br> "In fact, the only thing you do take out<br> of here are my cinnamon buns."<br> - So I never saw her again, obviously.<br> - Oh, my God, I can't believe you said that.<br> I feel guilty now.<br> - You do not.<br> - I do.<br> You're right. I... I don't miss her at all.<br> Okay, moving right along.<br> That takes care of Taz.<br> The old apple pie trick, eh?<br> For the open house.<br> Warm baked goods make it feel homier.<br> No, I'm just... I'm just making a pie.<br> I thought you were doing it<br> for the open house.<br> - So... Now. Now, you're not going to stay?<br> - God, no. No, no. You shouldn't either.<br> You shouldn't.<br> Come on.<br> Becca, I'm not going to bother anyone.<br> So we have the garbage cans in the back,<br> the sign out front, I mowed the lawn.<br> I thought we'd set the sign-in sheet here.<br> We can move through the living room.<br> That's fine.<br> Now, my wife's gonna hide out, but I'll<br> stick around, if that's okay with you.<br> Sure. However you want to do it.<br> - Okay. Perfect.<br> - Okay.<br> - Bye, babe.<br> - Bye.<br> Think that's everything.<br> I know, it's just gorgeous...<br> Southern-western exposures. Sun all day.<br> - Why don't we take a look upstairs?<br> - That's a great idea. I'll show you.<br> - Good. Cool.<br> - Follow me.<br> - Come on, honey.<br> - It's on 3/4 of an acre,<br> which is the largest<br> lot in the neighborhood.<br> We can start with the master bedroom<br> if you want to see that.<br> Wait. What's in here?<br> Well... This is... This is...<br> This would be a good room<br> for the little guy, obviously.<br> How about that, buddy? You like this room?<br> - Careful with that.<br> - Sweetheart. That's not our stuff.<br> - Thank you.<br> - So, how old's your son?<br> This is your son's room, I assume?<br> It... It was. It was his room.<br> But he died, my son. He died.<br> There was a car right out front.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - I'm...<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - Thank you.<br> This must be so difficult for you.<br> It's... It's pretty weird.<br> It's funny because I still...<br> I forget that he's not here sometimes.<br> Like maybe he's just hiding under the bed,<br> he's gonna pop out like he used to do.<br> But...<br> I still feel him here.<br> - Would you like to see the master bedroom?<br> - Yeah. Okay, come on.<br> Yeah. Sure, I'll be there.<br> - Who's that?<br> - Becca. She wants to hang out.<br> - This was a good idea.<br> - It's nice, right?<br> God, you're starting to show so early.<br> I know. I feel like a big old balloon.<br> I swear, once this kid is born,<br> I'm going right to the gym.<br> While Mom watches the baby.<br> What does that mean,<br> "While Mom watches the baby"?<br> While you're at the gym,<br> Mom can watch the baby. She loves that.<br> Auggie could watch the baby.<br> He works at night, so he'll be home.<br> Okay. Auggie then.<br> I resent the feeling that I get from you<br> that I don't deserve this baby.<br> Or that I'm not mature enough<br> or smart enough to take care of it.<br> I mean, my God, if Mom could do it,<br> how hard could it be?<br> - This all right?<br> - Yeah. It's fine.<br> I've just got to pick up a few things<br> and then we can do lunch.<br> - Okay. Yeah.<br> - They're made of strawberries.<br> Mommy, please,<br> can I have some Fruit Roll-Ups?<br> - No, Sammy. You know the answer.<br> - Please?<br> - Can I have some, please?<br> - Sammy, no.<br> I want the Fruit Roll-Ups.<br> - Not happening.<br> - Please, I'll be good.<br> - Stop it.<br> - Please.<br> - No. You're not gonna get them.<br> - I promise.<br> You know what? It's only three bucks.<br> Why don't you give him the Roll-Ups?<br> Not that it's any of your business,<br> but we don't allow candy in our house,<br> and my son knows that.<br> Come on, it's just fruit.<br> Why don't you give him the treat?<br> Are you a mom?<br> Yeah, I didn't think so. Excuse me.<br> Go to the car. Becca, go to the car.<br> Sammy, it's okay.<br> She just lost her son eight months ago,<br> and she's not feeling really very well.<br> - I'm so sorry...<br> - I don't care.<br> Mommy's okay.<br> - Hey-hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Fun day out?<br> - How'd it go here?<br> - Not so good. Not so good.<br> I think we need to clean out that room.<br> Okay.<br> Maybe make it into a guest room<br> or something.<br> Don't get any ideas.<br> Jesus.<br> Hello.<br> The door was wide open, so...<br> - And I knocked, but...<br> - Taz, shut up!<br> I saw the sign out front,<br> so I thought it'd be okay to...<br> - Looking to buy a house?<br> - Howie.<br> No.<br> No, I just came to give you this.<br> I said I'd let you read it<br> when it was done, so...<br> What is this?<br> Thank you.<br> We bumped into each other in the...<br> In the library.<br> And... And we decided to meet.<br> You decided to meet?<br> Yeah. Couple of times.<br> Okay.<br> - Sorry. I didn't realize that you...<br> - It's...<br> - Did you meet here?<br> - No. No. We met in the park.<br> You met in the park.<br> Yeah.<br> So, my wife<br> agrees to meet you in a public place,<br> and you...<br> And you what? You apologize?<br> - I guess.<br> - You guess? Okay.<br> - Okay. Okay. You apologize and...<br> - Come on, Howie, that's enough now.<br> - And then what?<br> - That's enough.<br> - Look at me.<br> - Howie. That is enough.<br> - What is that?<br> - It's a comic book.<br> It's a comic book? A comic book.<br> Did she tell you to bring it here?<br> - No, she didn't.<br> - No, she didn't,<br> because this is our house!<br> And just because there's a sign out front<br> doesn't mean that you can pop in!<br> - Howie, all right. All right. - And you<br> just don't... No, it's not all right!<br> You just don't walk into somebody's home<br> like that!<br> - You should show a little fucking respect!<br> - I gotta go.<br> You're an asshole.<br> Wait! Wait, Jason! Wait a minute. I'm sorry!<br> I'm an asshole.<br> Taz, stop it.<br> Taz! Taz!<br> Taz, stop it!<br> Buddy.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Same reason you don't tell me<br> why you come home reeking of pot.<br> Does it ever go away?<br> No.<br> I don't think it does. Not for me,<br> it hasn't. It's going on 11 years.<br> It changes, though.<br> How?<br> I don't know.<br> The weight of it, I guess.<br> At some point, it becomes bearable.<br> It turns into something<br> that you can crawl out from under<br> and carry around like<br> a brick in your pocket.<br> And you even forget it for a while,<br> but then you reach in for whatever reason,<br> and there it is.<br> "Right. That."<br> Which can be awful.<br> But not all the time.<br> It's kind of...<br> Not that you like it, exactly, but it's<br> what you've got instead of your son.<br> So, you carry it around.<br> And it doesn't go away.<br> Which is...<br> Which is what?<br> Fine. Actually.<br> Hello?<br> Hi.<br> Hi, it's Howie.<br> Howie Corbett from group.<br> Hi, Howie.<br> There you go, boy.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> You going to group?<br> - Yeah. You didn't want to go, did you?<br> - No.<br> ...the president,<br> essentially, will get up.<br> What do you think?<br> Hi, it's Jason. Please<br> leave a message.<br> You find the house okay?<br> Howie?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Becca?<br> Becca?<br> Becca?<br> Becca?<br> God!<br> Sorry.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Almost 6:00.<br> And you're just getting home?<br> - So, how was it?<br> - It was okay.<br> - Well, you look nice.<br> - Thank you.<br> Is she your girlfriend?<br> No, she's just a friend.<br> - She's pretty.<br> - Yeah.<br> She is pretty.<br> I liked this so much.<br> - It's... Well, it's beautiful.<br> - Thank you. Thanks.<br> It reminded me of Eurydice and Orpheus.<br> Do you know that myth?<br> No.<br> Eurydice dies,<br> and Orpheus misses her so much<br> that he travels to Hades to retrieve her<br> and... Well, in the end, it doesn't work out.<br> I should read it.<br> So, is the scientist your dad?<br> - The scientist that the boy's looking for?<br> - No.<br> - Is it based on him?<br> - No, my dad was an English teacher.<br> I was curious about that.<br> It's just a story.<br> - I know. I was just...<br> - Reading into it.<br> - Do you think they're real?<br> - Parallel universes?<br> I think it's basic science.<br> You know, if space is infinite,<br> then everything's possible.<br> So, somewhere out there, I'm what?<br> I'm making pancakes?<br> - Or I'm at a water park?<br> - Sure. Yeah.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah, both. You know, whatever.<br> I think, you know,<br> it's the laws of probability.<br> There are tons of you's out there,<br> and there's tons of me's floating around.<br> Yeah. And this is just<br> the sad version of us.<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> But there's other versions,<br> and in these other versions,<br> - everything goes our way.<br> - Assuming you believe in science.<br> I like that thought. It's nice.<br> Somewhere out there<br> I'm having a good time.<br> I thought you'd left.<br> No, I didn't leave.<br> I was thinking we could invite<br> Rick and Debbie over for a cookout.<br> Well, she's never gonna call me.<br> She thinks I hate her, so...<br> I'll let her off the hook.<br> - A cookout?<br> - Be good to see the kids.<br> Have to...<br> Have to get something for Emily, though.<br> It was her birthday.<br> She turned four last week.<br> Right.<br> Okay.<br> - Danny's is coming up.<br> - I know.<br> - It's gonna be a tough one.<br> - Yeah.<br> So, that kid,<br> Jason,<br> - did you tell him we didn't blame him?<br> - We don't blame him.<br> No, I know, but did you let him know that?<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> That's good.<br> - You could talk to him if you want.<br> - I don't want to.<br> Okay.<br> It's so quiet.<br> Well, that's 'cause I slipped Taz<br> a couple of Ambien.<br> - Funny.<br> - You think I'm joking?<br> So, what're we gonna do?<br> About what?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know. Just pick something.<br> Well,<br> we could go to Village Toys.<br> Pick up Candy Land for Emily.<br> It's probably something she'd like.<br> Candy Land. Yeah.<br> And then what?<br> Then we wrap it.<br> And then<br> we have the cookout.<br> And they'll come over.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> And we'll have a couple other people over,<br> so it's not too awkward for anyone.<br> Hi! Oh, my gosh. Look at you!<br> And then, to make them feel comfortable,<br> we'll ask a bunch of questions<br> about what the kids have been up to,<br> and we'll pretend we're really interested.<br> And then...<br> And then we'll wait for someone<br> to bring up Danny<br> while the kids are playing,<br> and maybe that will go<br> on for a little while.<br> And after that,<br> they'll go home.<br> And then what?<br> I don't know.<br> Something, though.<br>
