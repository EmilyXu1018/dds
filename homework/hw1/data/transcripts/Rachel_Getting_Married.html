                        I want my fucking Zippo now.<br> Walter, that is a behavior<br> that will get you...<br> Fuck you!<br> Are you making a choice?<br> Hold on.<br> - Hello?<br> - Don't you get it yet, Waldo?<br> She's making a choice<br> not to give you your lighter<br> because you'll torch<br> the self-help library again.<br> My name's Walter.<br> Did you kill anybody recently?<br> Did you run anybody over<br> with your fucking car?<br> Is that them?<br> Yeah. Yes, finally.<br> You're not going to let her drive, are you?<br> Walter, you are only responsible<br> for yourself.<br> - This all your stuff?<br> - Yeah.<br> So you never gave me<br> your cell phone number.<br> It was a mistake. I'm lucky I didn't<br> get fired. We've discussed this.<br> Hey. Here you are.<br> I thought you were going to<br> abandon me in rehab.<br> - No.<br> - It's 10:30. You're half an hour late.<br> I was just standing out here<br> with these lunatics.<br> - Oh, my God, you look so great.<br> - So do you, darling.<br> - Can I take care of that? Hi, Paul Buchman.<br> - Rosa. We met last time you came up.<br> - Yes, hi. Good to see you again.<br> - Hi.<br> Okay, let's go. Let's go.<br> - All right. Sure.<br> - Great.<br> - Good luck to you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Kym. Good luck to you.<br> Thank you.<br> All right. Hey, where is everybody?<br> - Hey, Carol.<br> - Hello, Kym.<br> Where is everybody? Where's Rachel?<br> She's back at the house getting ready.<br> There is so much going on at the house,<br> I cannot tell you, dear.<br> And you know your sister's doing<br> everything herself.<br> My sister's bending the environment<br> to her will? Really?<br> There's no wedding planners<br> or anything like that. It's just her<br> and Sidney and a whole lot of their friends.<br> And she is so thrilled<br> - that you're coming home.<br> - Great.<br> - Now, do we have everything?<br> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Can we just go?<br> Is there somebody that...<br> Anybody you need to say goodbye to?<br> God, no.<br> So are all of these energetic, young<br> wedding helpers staying at the house?<br> Because after nine months of constantly<br> revolving cell mates and crazy people and...<br> You weren't in a cell, Kym.<br> What? I was sort of looking forward to<br> a little privacy for once.<br> The only extra person at the house is Emma.<br> - Rachel and Emma.<br> - Yes.<br> Good God, how relaxing.<br> The only two people on the planet<br> less capable of delegating than Hannibal.<br> - On the eve of a wedding. Nachtmahr.<br> - Nachtmahr?<br> Nachtmahr. You don't know Nachtmahr?<br> Nachtmahrwas a nightmare so bad<br> it's in German.<br> I see.<br> Rachel must be, like, totally freaking out.<br> Is she too tense?<br> Are all of her latent food issues<br> rearing their heads?<br> Is she still hoarding Snickers<br> and Cool Whip under the bed<br> like when she was in high school?<br> She never did put that one to rest.<br> I don't think that's a problem<br> for her, darling.<br> No offense, Dad, but you never thought<br> that was a problem for her.<br> So I'm really looking forward<br> to seeing Mom.<br> You'll see your mom tonight and Andrew<br> at the rehearsal dinner.<br> Well, maybe I'll head over there,<br> to her house, after I see Rachel.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Can we pull over, please?<br> I'm sorry, I feel nauseous,<br> and I need something to drink.<br> - I have a Diet Coke for you.<br> - I prefer Pepsi from the fountain.<br> Hey, didn't I see you on Cops?<br> - Olive.<br> - Hey, there's Olive.<br> Rented chairs, tribes of people.<br> Yep.<br> - Hey, Dad, don't worry about it.<br> I'll get it. - Got it.<br> Hi, gentlemen.<br> Hello.<br> Anyway, I'm sorry. I just saw a ghost.<br> - Is this too short?<br> - Oh, my God! You are just minute!<br> Kymmie!<br> Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.<br> I have pins all over me.<br> - Yeah, I can feel.<br> - Kym, could you not smoke in here, please?<br> - You look great.<br> - Oh, no, I'm so fat.<br> Well, rehab makes you fat.<br> It's all the vending machines.<br> - No, stop it.<br> - No, you!<br> I would swear to God<br> that you were puking again.<br> - Hi, Kym.<br> - Hi, Emma.<br> Seriously, you're so tiny,<br> it's like you're Asian.<br> So what's the deal?<br> Are you an actual shrink yet?<br> Even though you're like 12 years old.<br> Rachel's taking psychology, not psychiatry.<br> You know the difference, right?<br> You should prescribe something soothing<br> for Emma, like Vicodin.<br> I will have my PhD in a year and a half,<br> and psychologists don't get<br> prescription pads.<br> I think they do in Guam, actually.<br> Could you please put that out?<br> Emma designed this dress,<br> and there's, like, 47 yards of fabric,<br> and it's going to go up like the Hindenburg.<br> - Okay, okay. I'm sorry. It's going out.<br> - Thank you, Kym.<br> Angela Paylin is coming to the wedding.<br> Angela Paylin is not coming.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, my God!<br> I ate so much cookie dough and did<br> so many whippits with Angela Paylin.<br> I know.<br> And she confessed to you<br> her secret Elvis Stojko fantasy.<br> - How did you...<br> - What?<br> - I spied on you.<br> - Elvis Stojko, the figure skater?<br> Oh, my God!<br> She had this fantasy where<br> she was wearing her hair up,<br> - and these very serious...<br> - Very, very<br> ...professional glasses because...<br> ... very serious.<br> She was an Olympic judge.<br> A world-renowned judge. At the men's...<br> - Skating final in the winter Olympics.<br> - In the winter Olympics.<br> - And Elvis Stojko was skating...<br> - For the gold.<br> In the finals to Could This Be Magic.<br> By Barry. By Barry!<br> And just when Barry gets to...<br> - Now, now, now, and hold on fast!<br> - Now, now, and hold on fast!<br> He skates over to the table<br> and he stops in front of her.<br> Their eyes lock and he reaches for her hand.<br> - And she takes it.<br> - Takes it.<br> - Undoes her hair!<br> - Oh, my God.<br> And they skate as a pair<br> to the rest of the song.<br> - And he gets disqualified.<br> - But he doesn't care!<br> - But he doesn't care.<br> - Right. Oh, my God!<br> I'm going to go downstairs and find Olive<br> and get some unconditional love.<br> You look great.<br> - Welcome home.<br> - Thank you. Emma.<br> Speaking of dogs, when am I going to<br> meet this fianc of yours, anyhow?<br> He went to pick up some stuff with Kieran.<br> He'll be back.<br> I'm making hot dogs and hungabungas.<br> Who wants what?<br> - It's too hot.<br> - I don't eat gluten, Paul.<br> - Two...<br> - May I have one, too?<br> Yeah. You don't eat what, dear?<br> Gluten.<br> - Where's Kym?<br> - Besides, I'm in my dress.<br> You're in your dress? Let me see it.<br> - No!<br> - No!<br> - All right. Okay.<br> - Come on, Olive.<br> - What can I get for you, Kymmie?<br> - Actually, I'm late for a meeting.<br> And I have to pee into a cup<br> and register as a general biohazard.<br> Okay, I'll drive you, honey.<br> No, that's okay.<br> Just tell me which car I should use.<br> Well, honey...<br> - Can I get a hungabunga, Paul?<br> - One hungabunga.<br> - Can I get one, too?<br> - Two hungabungas.<br> Which car?<br> - Kymmie, do me a favor now.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - I have my license.<br> - I know, dear.<br> You just wouldn't believe my insurance<br> right now, and I'm not that comfortable.<br> Can we figure something else out?<br> Hi. Hi, I'm here to pee into a cup.<br> She's here to pee into a cup.<br> Someone will be right with you.<br> Okay. There's a meeting I have to get to.<br> - The meetings are over in the other<br> building. - I know that.<br> Someone will be right with you. Have a seat.<br> I'm an addict.<br> Cocksucker!<br> - Only once.<br> - Sorry.<br> Only once, my dealer.<br> - I was very hard up for cash.<br> - I'm okay.<br> - Thank you. Excuse me.<br> - Anyway, I'm in from Hawaii.<br> This is my first time at this meeting.<br> Thank you.<br> - Welcome.<br> - Go right ahead.<br> - I'm Steve. I'm an addict.<br> - Hi, Steve.<br> - Hi, Steve.<br> - Hey. This is my...<br> My first meeting, actually,<br> so I'm a little bit...<br> Hey. Thanks for coming, Steve.<br> "One. We admitted that we are powerless<br> over our addiction,<br> "that our lives had become unmanageable.<br> "Two. We came to believe that<br> a power greater than ourselves... "<br> And whatever happened to me,<br> it took me away.<br> It just gave me hope for one more day.<br> And that's how I live, one day at a time.<br> You see, yesterday is gone<br> and tomorrow is not here.<br> The only thing I can do is what I can do<br> today to make tomorrow different.<br> There was a point, man,<br> where I thought I could do one more,<br> take another drink.<br> But it always end up the same.<br> You know, one was too many<br> and a thousand was never enough.<br> I got tired of starting from<br> square one again, man.<br> You know everything that I built up with<br> my family, everything that I built up...<br> You know, and people helping me<br> and providing for me...<br> You know, you relapse,<br> you got to start all over again.<br> And, man, I got tired of<br> starting over again.<br> You know, it was dramatic.<br> You know, there's a lot of, you know...<br> It's ups and downs<br> and it's crazy, and then...<br> And just recently,<br> there's something, you know...<br> I can feel myself almost, like,<br> missing the drama sometimes. Like, I'm...<br> It gets so boring sometimes.<br> You know I used to say I'm not an addict.<br> And it took me years to say I was an addict.<br> Then I spent years, like...<br> That's all I was.<br> You know? I was just an addict.<br> If you could just, kind of, accept it as<br> a fact, just one fact among many.<br> - That I can be that and other things.<br> - That's right.<br> Things that are going to build you up<br> in the journey that you're on.<br> All of us have felt that way at some time.<br> But I want to encourage you.<br> You're doing well.<br> God, grant me the serenity<br> to accept the things I cannot change,<br> the courage to change the things I can<br> and the wisdom to know the difference.<br> And it says keep coming back,<br> 'cause it works, if you work it.<br> Well, thanks a lot. I'll see you next time.<br> Kymmie! Carol, she's here.<br> Kymmie! I got a sandwich for you, darling.<br> It's meat loaf.<br> - Hi, dear.<br> - Hey.<br> - Quite a ride, huh?<br> - Yep.<br> - Meat loaf.<br> - Look at that.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yummy.<br> - Okay.<br> - Wow. Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - That's big.<br> I'm so glad you're here, darling.<br> I'm so glad you're back.<br> - Did you think I wasn't coming back?<br> - No.<br> - I'll take Bill's bike.<br> - Kymberly!<br> - Hey!<br> - Come meet Sidney.<br> - This is my betrothed, Sidney Williams.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> And this is best man, Kieran.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi, there.<br> - How are you?<br> - Good.<br> - How's your knee?<br> - Shut up.<br> You want meat loaf? My dad made meat loaf.<br> - Nice to see you.<br> - Nice to see you.<br> I think that we have started<br> a new tradition.<br> - That's what I think, yeah.<br> - Yeah. What's that?<br> I think it's the best man<br> and the maid of honor<br> sneaking off to get it on,<br> while the rest of the wedding party?<br> Very happily<br> and furiously plans for the big event.<br> But I thought...<br> I thought that was Emma's role.<br> What?<br> The maid of honor.<br> I mean, I heard that that was the plan.<br> I'm sure it is.<br> - I might be wrong.<br> - No.<br> Do you love it?<br> I mean, the lilac's fabulous, Emma.<br> She looks like a freesia.<br> Isn't it beautiful?<br> We should just cover your tattoo.<br> What?<br> Nothing, nothing.<br> I just really like the gray.<br> Of course you do.<br> We're all wearing lilac.<br> It's coordinated. It's a wedding.<br> Okay, well, this is in the color scheme,<br> and it looks like a cloud.<br> - It's fantastic.<br> - Exactly.<br> - You know how I am. I don't wear lilac.<br> - It's good to have a principle.<br> What? You wore a lilac sweater<br> with a cat face on the front of it<br> on the cover of Seventeen magazine...<br> - That was so cute!<br> ... when I was at fat camp.<br> Yeah, they paid me,<br> and I was on horse tranquillizer, so...<br> You look good. Seriously.<br> Why is Emma the maid of honor?<br> Why am I not the maid of honor?<br> Because.<br> What does that mean?<br> Because I wasn't entirely sure when<br> you were coming or if you'd even make it.<br> What? I wasn't sure<br> if you'd have time for a fitting...<br> Bullshit. It's a sari.<br> You take a bolt of cloth and you wrap it<br> around yourself a bunch of times.<br> Jesus Christ, I've been home for a day.<br> I can't get a straight answer<br> out of anybody.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm talking about Dad offering me food<br> every two seconds.<br> You know, Dad offers<br> Irish hunger strikers food.<br> No. You know, it's not even about the food.<br> He has to know exactly where I am<br> at all times because he's never<br> resolved his own trust issues.<br> - That's odd.<br> - You know what? Shut the fuck up!<br> - Blow me!<br> - Okay.<br> - Leave Dad alone.<br> - I'd love to. I want to, okay?<br> He won't let me. I just...<br> I can feel him watching me all the time.<br> And Carol, and you guys, too.<br> Because we have nothing better<br> to think about.<br> You know, everyone in the house is<br> looking at me like I'm a visiting sociopath.<br> I mean, seriously, what do you expect<br> me to do, burn the house down?<br> That was a mattress fire. That was<br> not even at home. It was at a sleepover.<br> Okay, you know what? Fine.<br> Fuck you both. You win.<br> I'm going to get "hazmat" tattooed<br> across my forehead for you people.<br> - Will that make you happy?<br> - God, you're like a harpy!<br> Okay, is being my maid of honor<br> that important to you?<br> Because I didn't think you gave a shit.<br> I'm sorry.<br> How could you fucking say that to me?<br> Jesus. Emma.<br> Emma, would you be horribly offended<br> and hurt<br> if I asked you step down as maid of honor?<br> For her? What?<br> Rachel, are you serious?<br> Is this what you want?<br> - Okay, fine. Fine.<br> - Not really.<br> You can have it. The crown is yours.<br> First runner-up.<br> Thank you, Emma, thank you.<br> - You know what?<br> - Everything is not about you, Kym.<br> No, it's not about me.<br> It's about sisterhood.<br> You're such a paragon of sisterhood.<br> Hooray for sisterhood!<br> You know what?

Kym.<br> And now Rachel's getting married.<br> Rachel getting married.<br> Yeah.<br> But we also need to<br> honor my little friend Ethan<br> who's gone on to another plane now,<br> you know.<br> But his spirit is here<br> and he lives in our heart<br> and pays no rent every day.<br> And he's watching over us.<br> Charlie Parker said,<br> "The music speaks louder than words. "<br> So I'm going to play a piece for you<br> that I've written for this occasion.<br> It's called Rachel loves Sidney.<br> That's the A-side.<br> The B-side is Sidney loves Rachel.<br> Excuse me for a second.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I don't know anyone at what is<br> obviously the loser end of the table.<br> Can I get to the masala?<br> You've known most of those people<br> since the eighth grade.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - You always pretend you don't know people.<br> - Watch my dress.<br> - Is it 'cause you owe them money?<br> I'm sorry, family members only<br> in this discussion.<br> Speaking of which, where is Mom?<br> Where's our mother?<br> How can she not be here?<br> I haven't seen her since I've been home.<br> She called a couple of times<br> and she said she's running late,<br> - but she should be here soon.<br> - God.<br> Kieran, do you want<br> any of this saag paneer?<br> No, thanks. Is there any krill?<br> - I'm kidding. Sorry, it's a joke.<br> - It just went over my head.<br> I can't believe Mom would be late<br> for my release back into the wild.<br> And here I was thinking tonight<br> was about Rachel.<br> Rach, I forgot to tell you.<br> Carol got the helium tanks.<br> The words Carol and helium somehowjust...<br> Hey, aren't there some rules<br> about helium tanks?<br> She would not have any idea<br> what to do with a helium tank.<br> I think that's only on public property?<br> Though, helium tanks.<br> - Yeah, it's a huge liability.<br> - Helium tanks?<br> - You're a lawyer?<br> - Was, for five minutes.<br> Say something legal.<br> Tort.<br> What do you do now?<br> Now I just help Sidney out<br> with the business side of his stuff.<br> Sweet.<br> - Do you want me to call her?<br> - No, no.<br> - There she is.<br> - Oh, my God! Mom!<br> - Mom!<br> - Darling, hi.<br> - Kym! Come here, honey.<br> - Thank you.<br> Did you get my note?<br> Yeah.<br> Let me look at you. You're beautiful.<br> - No, I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat.<br> - No, nonsense. You girls.<br> - Is everything okay?<br> - Yes.<br> Mom, where have you been?<br> - Everything's fine.<br> - Did you get the dates confused?<br> No, no, everything's fine, honey.<br> - Introduce me around.<br> - This is Sidney's family.<br> This is Carol-Jean. This is my mom, Abby.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - And this is her husband, Andrew.<br> - Andrew.<br> - John, Abby, my mom.<br> - Pleasure.<br> - Don't you steal her.<br> - Hi.<br> - Nice to meet you. Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And this is Grandma.<br> - Hello.<br> - Emma!<br> Mom, you look so great.<br> Really, you look amazing.<br> Honey, don't smoke. I don't think it's...<br> Can you smoke here?<br> - Yeah, yeah, totally. It's a private party?<br> - This is the best man, Kieran.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Very nice to meet you. I'm Kieran.<br> How's Grandma?<br> Is she still surly and irascible?<br> She's great. You know Grandma.<br> She sends her love.<br> - Great, same.<br> - You want to sit?<br> Go put the cigarette out,<br> 'cause I don't think it's fine.<br> - Sit.<br> - Just put it out.<br> - Just put it out.<br> - Okay. It's going out.<br> The father of the bride and the father of<br> the groom are not supposed to do anything<br> but grin like jack -o' -lanterns<br> and write checks,<br> and I think that's what we've been doing,<br> John, you and I, yeah? Right?<br> Williams' family. Carol-Jean and John.<br> Beautiful sister Kyrah.<br> And of course, Grand Mama Herreast.<br> And Specialist Joseph Gonzales.<br> As the good doctor said to start us off<br> with the meal,<br> we're glad that you're out of harm's way,<br> and we want you home for good.<br> Happy to be home. Thank you.<br> Williams' family, welcome to Connecticut<br> and its complicated tax structure.<br> We just met.<br> I just want you to know<br> how blessed we are to be<br> joining forces with you, and we've just met,<br> but I'm going to tell you, we love you.<br> Well, I have known Sidney for...<br> What is it? Fifteen, 20, 20...<br> Most of my life, most of my life.<br> He's been a great friend.<br> He's been with me through thick and thin.<br> And<br> I'll tell you,<br> sometimes it's gotten very, very thin.<br> But he stood by me through all of it and...<br> My friend, it is a pleasure and an honor<br> to be able to stand by you<br> on this profound occasion.<br> I love you, and you couldn't have done<br> any better here.<br> Cheers.<br> We are gathered here to celebrate love<br> pure and simple.<br> Rachel is pure. Sidney is simple.<br> May the two of you live and love<br> for as long as you want,<br> but never want for as long as you live.<br> And most importantly,<br> may all of your ups and downs<br> come only in the bedroom.<br> - You're paying for that, Emma.<br> - I can't believe I just did that.<br> - Be careful, be careful.<br> - Don't cut yourself.<br> I want to make a toast to the happy couple<br> 'cause I want to come visit you in Hawaii.<br> And, Sidney, what's the name<br> of that place again?<br> It's Hunuku-ook, Hunookook...<br> Yeah, what they said.<br> So I've known the bride her entire life.<br> Not biblically speaking.<br> Except for that time we French-kissed<br> at Evan Yasky's party? In ninth grade.<br> Stop!<br> - Film. I want film.<br> - It was a dare, you know.<br> So commence embarrassing story.<br> Wait, that wasn't it?<br> So do you remember when I was teaching<br> you how to drive in the Wagoneer,<br> and you sideswiped that taxi<br> and knocked off his side mirror?<br> No, I have no recollection<br> of that whatsoever.<br> Well, well, well, I would like to share<br> with everyone that Miss Rachel,<br> before she had her license<br> or knew anything about how to drive,<br> managed to out-maneuver an irate,<br> screaming cab driver<br> all the way across 96th Street<br> to the East River,<br> handily avoiding two EMT guys<br> loading an old lady<br> onto a gurney or something.<br> And then she got the number of one of<br> the EMT guys and went out with him twice.<br> Yeah, that I did do. Three. Three times.<br> Hey, Rach,<br> was that the guy with the peroxide hair?<br> So, anyway, when the cab driver<br> finally caught up with us,<br> she talked him down from<br> his Middle-Eastern fury in like...<br> Mahamoud! Such a nice man!<br> In like, you know, pretend Arabic,<br> Farsi, Urdu, I don't know.<br> And then she uses his radio thing<br> to call his dispatcher<br> and recommend him for a commendation<br> because she's so sweet.<br> So here's to a woman who can<br> drive fast, pick up a paramedic,<br> make up foreign languages<br> and still get you home in one piece.<br> And, Sidney, you're a lucky bastard.<br> Hear, hear.<br> I prayed for you, Rachel. I prayed for you.<br> I knew you'd come, and here you are,<br> and we are one, all of us.<br> And this is how it is in Heaven.<br> Just like this.<br> Amen.<br> And I'm so glad we're having<br> a rehearsal on it now.<br> Yes, it's the little princess.<br> Here's to you, Sid. I love you to pieces.<br> You're the best brother anybody can ask for.<br> I want to give thanks.<br> I've known Rachel since kindergarten,<br> not quite her entire life, Emma, but...<br> So you win. But...<br> I just... I'm so grateful<br> to be your bridesmaid<br> and be a part of this moment and...<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> Hello. Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Relax, it's seltzer.<br> Hello.<br> I'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger<br> of doom for this evening.<br> I would like to thank you all<br> for coming and welcome you.<br> Even though I haven't seen most of you<br> since my latest stretch in the big house.<br> But you all look fabulous.<br> So during the 20 minutes or so<br> that I was not in the hole for<br> making a shiv out of my toothbrush,<br> I actually did participate<br> in the infamous 12-step program.<br> Twelve steps.<br> Step-ball-change. Step-ball-change.<br> Still waiting for the change part.<br> So... But, you know, as they say,<br> the relapse is an almost inevitable part<br> of recovery.<br> So I get high marks in that mode.<br> Anywho.<br> I... Well, as more of you know<br> than are likely to admit,<br> one of the steps, actual steps,<br> is about making amends.<br> So, I did a lot of apologizing to people.<br> Some of whom barely remembered me,<br> most of whom barely remembered anything.<br> And I apologized for,<br> you know, like, bouncing a check,<br> or passing out in their bathtub<br> or flooding their<br> house and, you know,<br> just basically for involving them in<br> sordid activities that they were<br> desperately trying to forget. I<br> had to call this one girl who was,<br> I think, 14,<br> but she couldn't come to the phone<br> actually because<br> her mom had taken out<br> a restraining order, but...<br> But anyway... So I spent a lot of time...<br> The point is, I spent a lot of time<br> apologizing to people who were<br> pretty much perfect strangers.<br> So, I would very much<br> like to take this opportunity<br> to not only congratulate<br> my extraordinary sister,<br> the future explorer in matters of the mind,<br> thank you very much,<br> and her adorable, impending husband<br> on the occasion<br> of their unprecedented nuptials,<br> but also, to apologize<br> to said extraordinary sister,<br> future explorer in matters of the mind, for<br> what? I don't know. Everything.<br> And I really mean that, Rach. You've...<br> I've been a nightmare, you've been a saint,<br> and I'm reallyjust so damn glad<br> to be here with you<br> and Sidney's family<br> and our family and just...<br> Everyone's together and I'm just...<br> It's really great. So I am hereby<br> raising my seltzer to my laudatory sister<br> and herewith making amends.<br> Sidney, you are robbing<br> our dysfunctional family<br> of one of its most vital ingredients,<br> and its only member still willing to<br> lend me money.<br> - So, boo on you.<br> - That's not true.<br> Anyway, enjoy Hawaii.<br> - L'chaim.<br> - L'chaim.<br> One, two, one, two.<br> Yo, Sidney, who I met<br> hanging out in Kingston, Jamaica,<br> while we were at House of Leo,<br> and Stone Love was playing that night.<br> Those big speakers pounding,<br> all that Jamaican dub was pumping,<br> clouds of those medicinal herbs<br> were floating.<br> Man. Was a lot of fun, my man.<br> It was great meeting you, hanging out<br> with you, becoming friends with you,<br> seeing all the amazing things<br> that you're doing musically.<br> All I want to say to you guys is,<br> may you both live to be 100.<br> And me, 100, but minus a day,<br> so I'll never know beautiful people<br> like you have passed away.<br> Do your thing, baby.<br> I felt that. I felt that.<br> You drank it and I felt it.<br> I know.<br> Sidney has always nurtured me<br> and supported me<br> no matter what he's been through.<br> How much do you owe him?<br> How much money do you owe him?<br> In lira, it's billions.<br> Everyone's saying so much love<br> and beautiful words<br> and amazing stuff, and...<br> - This is not an award.<br> - I know, I'm not even using it.<br> You're like accepting an award here.<br> That's what it's about, you know,<br> there's nothing more.<br> Everything else, just destroy it.<br> Just destroy it.<br> Because without love... You know?<br> Hello, Olive.<br> I know it. It's in my head.<br> Oh, God, I am exhausted.<br> - Is there any watermelon?<br> - Let me see.<br> - Nice apology.<br> - What?<br> Nice apology.<br> I was toasting you<br> and I was making amends.<br> It's one of the steps. It's important.<br> I know what the steps are.<br> I learned them in school,<br> and I visited you in various<br> facilities, Kym.<br> Oh, God.<br> Dad? What?<br> "Amends. Noun, usually followed by 'for,'<br> off-set a disability<br> "or frustration by development<br> in another direction. "<br> - Yes.<br> - But you've never said anything to me<br> that's remotely apologetic,<br> yet all of sudden at my wedding dinner<br> in front of everybody,<br> you decide to grace us all<br> with your development.<br> I just got home.<br> "Gee. Hey, everybody and guests,<br> "just in case you might be thinking<br> about something else for five minutes,<br> "like, I don't know, my sister's wedding,<br> they just cut me loose.<br> "I'm a loose cannon!<br> Anybody up for some rehab humor?<br> "Because I'm really, really fine<br> with acknowledging my disease.<br> "Hey, and now watch me be really selfless<br> and weave a lovely blanket apology<br> "to my sister for being<br> just a tad out of her loop. "<br> - You are so cynical.<br> - Rachel, enough.<br> Rachel, she is making an effort here.<br> An effort, is that what that was?<br> Because I think she presumes<br> that since everything has always<br> revolved around her disease,<br> that everything else is going to revolve<br> around her recovery. That's what I think.<br> - Rachel, she just got home.<br> - Again.<br> - I had no idea you were so angry, Doctor.<br> - I'm not.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Kymmie, your sister has got<br> a lot on her plate right now.<br> - She is uptight about...<br> - I'm not uptight, Dad!<br> She's meeting Sidney's folks<br> for the first time, menus,<br> there's all this live music, you're home.<br> There's...<br> It's just that there are<br> a thousand things to worry about.<br> Absolutely. A wedding will take everything<br> out of you. I'll tell you that.<br> Yeah, and that's why it would be so lovely<br> if we could all...<br> You know, you people really need to purge.<br> You really should go to a Nar-Anon<br> or something. It's...<br> Now, Kym, come on, baby. Oh, my Lord.<br> We've been to Nar-Anon. You know that.<br> Wait, wait a second. You people? You mean,<br> your family? The people in this room?<br> Yes. All of you people living in<br> this little world ofjudgment<br> and paranoia and mistrust.<br> I can feel it all the time. It's like...<br> At the slightest sign of ingratitude or<br> absence of atonement, it's like<br> the fucking Salem witch trials around here.<br> - I should just use again. I should.<br> - Don't even start that.<br> - Don't even start.<br> - Wait, wait, wait.<br> Kym. Kym, look at me.<br> Nobody can make you feel any kind of<br> way unless you let them. Period. The end.<br> Thank you, Carol,<br> but you people are my family.<br> I mean, you make me feel like shit<br> a hundred times a day.<br> You know what, Rach? You try living under<br> Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes,<br> - tell me how you like it.<br> - What constant monitoring?<br> - Kym?<br> - Oh, my God! Are you serious?<br> "Carol, Carol, where is she?"<br> "Don't sleep here, sleep here.<br> Eat this. You know, I'll drive you. "<br> Dad, really, honestly,<br> you're kind of obsessed.<br> Oh, my God. That's hardly news.<br> I mean, you may not know this, Kym.<br> No, sure you do.<br> I mean, the only way to engage Dad<br> in any meaningful communication<br> is to start the conversation with your name.<br> "Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?"<br> It resuscitates him.<br> It jars him into the moment, like an alarm.<br> - Rachel, that is not true. It is totally<br> unfair. - What? She's even worse, Dad!<br> "Dad, you're never going to believe this,<br> but that check you sent me<br> "never showed up,<br> and my landlord hates me. "<br> "Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs<br> with cab fare?<br> "And you're never going to believe this<br> "but I lost my wallet<br> and my checkbook got stolen.<br> "I got to go to the emergency room,<br> and everybody hates me. "<br> You know what, Rachel?<br> It really sounds like you have<br> some serious paternal/sibling<br> issues to work through.<br> Please! Are you kidding?<br> The two of you are like<br> a double helix of crises.<br> - Oh, shut up, shut up.<br> - I mean, in the language of psychology,<br> one could say<br> you both suffer from acute boundary issues.<br> Rachel! It is very nice that you're<br> getting your PhD.<br> - Oh, God!<br> - Don't be patronizing!<br> I'm sorry, but it's not...<br> It's ugly, honey. It's not becoming to you.<br> Well, how come she gets to spout off about<br> paternal/sibling issues,<br> but God forbid I should even reference<br> the boundary thing,<br> even though I actually know<br> what I'm talking about.<br> By the way, I'm not in crisis.<br> I haven't been in crisis in a year.<br> - You just got out of rehab!<br> - Oh, my God!<br> Why is this so difficult<br> for you to understand?<br> Rehabilitation, crisis.<br> You should really learn the difference.<br> No, it's like you're not happy unless<br> I'm in some kind of a desperate situation.<br> You have no idea what to do with me<br> unless I'm in crisis.<br> Why am I the only one<br> willing to say this shit?<br> You are so much more<br> evolved in your suffering.<br> I'm not... Who is talking about that?<br> Your suffering is not the most<br> important thing to everybody.<br> - Who is saying it is?<br> - I have a life. I'm in school.<br> - I'm getting married. I'm...<br> - What?<br> - I'm pregnant.<br> - You're pregnant? You're pregnant now?<br> - Are you serious?<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - What?<br> - Oh, my God!<br> That is so unfair!<br> So unfair!<br> When did you find out about this?<br> Roughly about the day before<br> we decided to get married.<br> I can barely believe this myself!<br> How far? How along? You know?<br> I mean, how pregnant are you?<br> Did you tell your mother?<br> - Yeah. We told her at dinner.<br> - Good. Okay, good.<br> - She was so happy.<br> - Dad, stop. Can you just stop?<br> Please. Seriously. Fuck me!<br> Rachel, I'm sorry, Dad, but you can't drop<br> a tectonic bit of information<br> into a completely separate conversation,<br> Rachel. You can't do that.<br> - Kym, you're going to have a niece.<br> - Or nephew.<br> I know. Oh, God. Yeah, I'm excited for you.<br> But you can't<br> tell me when we're talking like this, Rach.<br> It's a total set-up. It's not fair.<br> Yeah.<br> God. I am so fucking exhausted.<br> Oh, God.<br> Dad, will you tell her I'm happy for her?<br> She won't talk to me.<br> I'm really tired.<br> I think I'm going to head up to bed. Sidney?<br> - Yeah. That's a great idea.<br> - You're leaving now,<br> - in the middle of this conversation?<br> - Yes.<br> Kymmie, she's pregnant<br> and she's exhausted, baby.<br> Okay. Okay, fine. Fair enough.<br> Thank you so much<br> for telling me about Hawaii.<br> - Congratulations, Sid.<br> - Thanks.<br> Rachel, I cannot tell you how happy I am.<br> Do you guys want anything?<br> Do you want a sandwich or anything?<br> You guys must be hungry.<br> You got aloo gobi, there's cold saagwala.<br> - I really am pretty sleepy, Dad.<br> - You really are pretty everything!<br> And you, too!<br> Holy cow. This has been one hell of a day.<br> I think...<br> If you don't mind, sweetie,<br> I'm just going...<br> - No!<br> - I mean, my God.<br> - I'm just going to go to bed.<br> - I'll be right up, dear.<br> - I just want to load the dishwasher.<br> - Grandpa.<br> That's me.<br> Thanks for taking that.<br> - I'll see you in the morning.<br> - Night, night. Sweet dreams.<br> You know, I hope it was okay<br> that we told Mom at dinner about the baby.<br> Of course it was, lamb chop.<br> You should tell her.<br> I'm just so happy 'cause<br> I'm going to be a granddaddy.<br> - I wish Ethan were here.<br> - You what?<br> - I wish Ethan were here.<br> - I know, sweetheart. Me, too. Me, too.<br> - Take that woman.<br> - You got it.<br> Just let me know if you need<br> a hand with any of that.<br> Get out of here, Sid.<br> Oh, gosh. Look at that. How exquisite.<br> - Isn't that pretty?<br> - I can't borrow this.<br> What do you carry in here?<br> - A vital organ? A tiny spleen?<br> - It's divine, really.<br> You know, Rachel, you really have to<br> take care of yourself now, you know?<br> You have to eat properly.<br> You have to get enough rest.<br> I will, Mom.<br> How's everything at the house?<br> Is it all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah? How's Sidney?<br> Good, good.<br> What about his friend? What's his name?<br> - Kieran.<br> - Right.<br> He was a big hit, wasn't he?<br> - Is your sister behaving herself?<br> - I'm not exactly sure what that means.<br> Well, she needs a lot of acknowledgment.<br> - You think?<br> - Come on.<br> It can't be easy.<br> Everybody knowing your troubles like that.<br> Stop fretting.<br> Mom, does it bother you at all,<br> Carol doing so much stuff for the wedding?<br> No. I'm thrilled to be doing the flowers.<br> Come on. You know how much that means<br> to me. And they're going to be exquisite.<br> - I bet.<br> - That's just enough.<br> But I mean,<br> you could do whatever you want.<br> I mean, the flowers are going to be great,<br> and so are you, and...<br> If you wanted to do anything else I would...<br> Thank you, sweetheart. No, I don't.<br> Can you see me? I'd be one of those<br> women, you know, like,<br> the insane wedding mother,<br> you know, the hors d'oeuvres, and...<br> Come on, those little hot dogs? It's not me.<br> It's going to be perfect.<br> Everything is going to be so beautiful.<br> And even your sister is going to have<br> a good time. It's all great.<br> And I'm going to be a grandmother!<br> So hooray!<br> Hooray!<br> Here's Grandma's ring. Let's try this.<br> Try it on.<br> I hope it's a boy.<br> Just as long as it's healthy,<br> that's what you say.<br> - Hi, I'm Kym. I'm an addict.<br> - Hi, Kym.<br> I am nine months clean.<br> When I was 16,<br> I was babysitting my little brother.<br> And I was...<br> I had taken all these Percocet<br> and I was unbelievably high.<br> And I...<br> We'd driven over to the park on Lakeshore.<br> And he was in his red socks,<br> just running around in these<br> piles of leaves.<br> And he would bury me,<br> and I would bury him in the leaves.<br> And he was pretending that he was a train.<br> And so, he was charging through the leaves,<br> making tracks.<br> And I was the caboose and I was...<br> So he kept saying,<br> "Coal, caboose! Coal, caboose!"<br> And...<br> We were...<br> It was time to go and I was driving home.<br> And<br> I lost control of the car<br> and drove off the bridge.<br> And the car went into the lake.<br> And I couldn't get him out of his car seat.<br> And he drowned.<br> And I struggle with God so much<br> because I can't forgive myself.<br> And I don't really want to right now. I can<br> live with it, but I can't forgive myself.<br> And sometimes, I don't want to believe<br> in a god that could forgive me.<br> But I do want to be sober.<br> I'm alive and I'm present,<br> and there's nothing controlling me.<br> If I hurt someone, I hurt someone.<br> I can apologize<br> and they can forgive me or not.<br> But I can change.<br> And I just wanted to share that and say,<br> congratulations that God makes you<br> look up. I'm so happy for you.<br> But if he doesn't, come here.<br> That's all. Thank you.<br> Thanks for sharing.<br> Where's... Where's you, Emma?<br> - Emma, where's you?<br> - I'm right here.<br> - It's really raining.<br> - That's today.<br> - Done.<br> - It's going to be fine.<br> Okay.<br> It's going to be totally, totally,<br> totally fine.<br> All right.<br> This is what you've got, Emma? So far?<br> I'm fine. That is kind of perfect.<br> There's six of each, right?<br> - Except for me.<br> - I'm the telephone.<br> Hey, Rachel! Check it out!<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - It's up.<br> It's going to have walls around it as well.<br> Yay!<br> You guys, there's too many at this table.<br> - Sorry.<br> - There's too many.<br> Carol, they're back!<br> Are you guys hungry?<br> I made a salad nioise. It's got tuna.<br> I was just thinking salad nioise.<br> - Dad, can we focus on what we were doing?<br> - Of course. I'm sorry.<br> Hey.<br> The Rosenzwiegs.<br> Could we put the Rosenzwiegs far from me?<br> - Dad, they're your friends.<br> - They are not my friends, darling.<br> They've just lived next door<br> to us for 10,000 years.<br> I am this lovely face right over here.<br> That is a perfect place to put me in.<br> Where are you putting me? In the stockade?<br> Kym, stop it, you're at the family table.<br> Listen, just don't sit me next to<br> Michael or Sandy, okay?<br> They're not invited.<br> Sandy never responded to<br> my amends e-mail from Milestones.<br> I hate it when people<br> don't meet you halfway.<br> You know, why don't you give<br> the amends thing a rest?<br> You're at the family table with us.<br> That would make it 13, though.<br> I think Rachel wanted to keep it to 12.<br> Right.<br> Where are you putting me?<br> I was going to put you with Cookie Puss<br> and the Chicago cousins<br> because they always get really drunk<br> and need wrangling.<br> Well, can someone else do it?<br> I was sort of planning on enjoying myself.<br> - You're the only one they're afraid of.<br> - No, this is easy.<br> We can put Grandma Rose<br> down here with her companion<br> at this other table,<br> which is actually a really good idea.<br> Great. That's all I need. Another reason<br> for Grandma Rose to hate me.<br> - She does not hate you.<br> - Are you kidding?<br> She's still mad about<br> the whole Rite Aid thing.<br> Nonsense!<br> Dad, can I show you something<br> in the kitchen?<br> - Eliza, would you excuse us for a moment?<br> - Yeah.<br> Thanks.<br> - Rachel, what is this behavior?<br> - Can I just have a day? Please?<br> Have all the days you want, darling.<br> Nobody is trying to take your day.<br> Then why are you defending her?<br> Defending her from what?<br> Rachel, nobody's defending anybody.<br> Why are you protecting her?<br> Because I don't want her to think<br> we don't want her.<br> Sometimes I don't want her.<br> It's my fucking wedding!<br> - I want my table to be perfect.<br> - She's your sister. Stop.<br> Let's put the dishes here because<br> I have to reload this dishwasher, I can see.<br> Paul, you know...<br> Paul, I was thinking about it,<br> and I actually did some preliminary<br> sketches. I'd love to show them to you.<br> He's actually...<br> He's not kidding about this.<br> - I think that if you move...<br> - He's been working on this.<br> If you move things like the salad bowls<br> on the upper tier,<br> you could probably get about<br> Sidney.<br> Does he know?<br> You're showing me how to load<br> the dishwasher?<br> I'm showing you how to do it right.<br> Sidney,<br> my future son-in-law,<br> you're a wonderful young man.<br> You'll make a lot of money in this business,<br> and the world is your oyster,<br> but you don't know shit<br> about loading a dishwasher.<br> Well, with all due respect, sir,<br> the mantle has passed.<br> Painful. Painful, sweetie.<br> All right.<br> Oh, no!<br> What, are we timing it?<br> Yeah, let's work with time,<br> if you're going to do it right.<br> - Dad, what's the time limit?<br> - Go!<br> - How long do you want to time it?<br> - Two minutes.<br> Is that all right?<br> Are you all right with that, sir?<br> Would you like me to spot you 30 seconds?<br> - Go!<br> - Paul, I think your problem is mainly<br> in lid placement.<br> Inverting the lids and putting them<br> in the upper tier is just pass.<br> - It's kind of old-school.<br> - There's food on that one!<br> - Thank you, Kymmie.<br> - Lettuce leaf, lettuce leaf!<br> Follow the schematic.<br> It might be worth pointing out<br> that the dishes need to be rinsed.<br> - Are you shaking in your boots?<br> - You got 20 seconds.<br> Fifteen seconds left.<br> Rachel, darling, you are out of the will.<br> You know that?<br> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,<br> five, four, three, two, one...<br> You know, all you young people<br> who are applauding,<br> you should go fuck yourselves.<br> - Sweetie, keep it clean!<br> - No, I'm just saying.<br> - It's a wonderful attempt, Son.<br> - Okay. I tried to fix it.<br> Kieran, if you could clean out<br> that machine, I will then be able<br> to break out the whoop-ass<br> on this young man here.<br> He's breaking out the whoop-ass!<br> - Let's break out the whoop-ass.<br> - Break out the whoop-ass.<br> When that machine is empty,<br> I will show you how it's done.<br> What is this whoop-ass you speak of?<br> You should rest. You should rest. Really.<br> - Silverware is a part of the art.<br> - Okay, all right.<br> I will say that Sidney had<br> a little time to survey things.<br> He did a little planning<br> and made some sketches.<br> But that's all right.<br> I'm ready any time you say "go. "<br> Go!<br> $5! $5 on the geezer!<br> Rinsing!<br> Go, Dad!<br> Here, Son. Have some.<br> Cup handles!<br> Side load!<br> I didn't know about side load.<br> He's good.<br> Buchman, in front of your family.<br> Buchman, your women will weep.<br> Last one!<br> - Could I have my time, please?<br> - You have 15 seconds left.<br> Fifteen seconds left and I need more dishes!<br> Somebody give me more dishes!<br> Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!<br> - Don't get cocky, keep it going.<br> - Where we at? Kieran?<br> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,<br> five, four, three, two, one...<br> - All right.<br> - That's it, man. That's...<br> What?<br> Where are you going?<br> Let's grab some lemonade on the porch.<br> Is everything okay?<br> - Hey!<br> - See you later.<br> I have to. I mean...<br> I mean, if I could do it the way<br> I wanted to do it. Literally...<br> Hey, Rach? Are you getting a manicure?<br> Hi.<br> You don't remember me, do you?<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> God is punishing me.<br> No, no, he's blessing me.<br> Well. Wow.<br> - So, how are you?<br> - I'm great. I'm great.<br> You remember?<br> We were in the hospital together, right?<br> We were... Were you at Milestones?<br> No. I didn't go to Milestones.<br> I didn't have the coverage.<br> We were on the same floor at Loeb House.<br> Okay.<br> - You look great.<br> - Twenty-eight months, clean and sober.<br> Praise God.<br> Amen.<br> I can't believe that I'm seeing you again.<br> I know. It's so weird.<br> Listen.<br> Do you remember that exercise<br> where we had to write down experiences<br> and pass them anonymously<br> to another person?<br> Yeah. Yeah, the human mirror.<br> Seeing things from a fresh perspective.<br> I got yours.<br> You drew poodles in the margins.<br> I know it's supposed to be anonymous<br> and everything...<br> - Yeah.<br> ... but you...<br> You<br> were so brave.<br> The way your uncle abused<br> you and your sister<br> and how it led to your sister's anorexia.<br> And how you stayed up nights with her<br> when she was down to 50 pounds.<br> I will never forget reading that,<br> - I swear to God.<br> - Yeah.<br> I never, ever, thought I would have<br> the chance to thank you.<br> It was your strength<br> that gave me the courage<br> to confront my own abuse<br> and help turn my life around.<br> - Listen, I'm in a great group.<br> - Rachel. I...<br> I'm so glad to hear it. Excuse me.<br> Sir, just stop.<br> Sorry, I just need a second. Rachel?<br> Rachel?<br> Rachel, what are you doing?<br> Where... Where are you going?<br> Rachel!<br> You know, I never had anorexia.<br> And you certainly didn't watch over me<br> while I was sleeping.<br> And we don't have a<br> goddamned pedophile uncle<br> who made our childhood a living hell<br> and explains away all your shit<br> in one fell swoop.<br> Did you tell them that Dad forced us<br> into a life of prostitution as well?<br> I wasn't hurting... No one got hurt, Rach.<br> - I'm hurt.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Rachel, open the door. Rachel!<br> So what, you're just going?<br> - I'm sorry, but I hate her.<br> - No, you don't hate her.<br> Dad, don't tell me what I don't hate.<br> I hate, hate, hate the lies.<br> I mean, she lied in rehab.<br> What do you mean, she lied?<br> I mean, she lied to the people<br> who were working with her,<br> who were trying to help her.<br> Dad, she lies to everybody.<br> Where is she now?<br> - Where am I now, Dad?<br> - Thank God.<br> - Rachel!<br> - We're in here, Kym.<br> Thanks for abandoning me.<br> I had to take a taxi.<br> Hey, Rach.<br> I mean, are you kidding me?<br> Why would anything I said or didn't say<br> at the hospital...<br> Jesus Christ!<br> Are they going to play all weekend?<br> - Knock it off!<br> - Norman! Boys! Stop, please!<br> Guys, would you give it a rest?<br> Just give it a rest.<br> Why would it hurt you? It wasn't about you!<br> - Why not?<br> - Rachel.<br> What? Stop, Dad. Why not?<br> Why wasn't it about me?<br> I mean, I was hopeful.<br> I was on your side. Still am.<br> Do you have any idea what that means?<br> Do you have any idea<br> how lonely it was here with everybody gone<br> into your<br> terrible little world?<br> I mean, there was nothing left.<br> Everybody was just empty.<br> You think that they<br> knew I was alive<br> or needed anything during your<br> life?<br> And after all that, the fights,<br> the screaming,<br> the blaming, the loneliness,<br> and Mom and Dad and the divorce and<br> death<br> and all that fucking hopefulness, I mean...<br> And Dad not even being able to listen<br> to music any more.<br> You were lying about us instead of<br> telling the truth about yourself.<br> God, Rach.<br> What is this about, girls?<br> Well, apparently, she has a whole history<br> of sexual molestation<br> that we didn't know about.<br> - What?<br> - God.<br> Kym, what is your sister saying?<br> Did you say you were sexually molested?<br> It was a long time ago.<br> Were you?<br> No!<br> Why in God's name<br> would you say something like that?<br> It was an anonymous exercise.<br> And it seemed like a good idea at the time.<br> Dad, look at me. Okay? I am right here.<br> Okay?<br> And I am telling you that after Ethan died,<br> I wanted her to get better orjust die.<br> - Rachel, she's better.<br> - And... No, no.<br> Recovery doesn't work if you lie.<br> She knows that.<br> I am worthless to her.<br> - She doesn't give a shit about the rest of<br> us! - You are not worthless. How dare you!<br> You're my sister.<br> I love you guys.<br> I need you guys, but you don't<br> get to sit around<br> for the rest of my life deciding<br> what I'm supposed to be like.<br> I mean, you weren't there.<br> You weren't inside of my head<br> when I was fucked-up.<br> - You are certainly not there now.<br> - Kym.<br> You haven't got any idea how I feel.<br> Kym, you took Ethan for granted.<br> Okay. You were high for his life.<br> You were not present.<br> - Okay. You were high.<br> - Yes.<br> And you drove him off a bridge.<br> And now he's dead.<br> - Rachel, it was an accident.<br> - Yes, I was.<br> Yes, I was stoned out of my mind.<br> Who do I have to be now?<br> I could be Mother Theresa.<br> It wouldn't make a difference what I did.<br> Did I sacrifice every bit of<br> love in this life because<br> I killed our little brother?<br> - It was an accident. It was an accident.<br> - And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> - Kymmie, Kymmie, it was an accident.<br> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, too, Dad.<br> Can I...<br> I'm sorry, guys. I just want to...<br> If I can say something.<br> Look, I know you're... You're, you know...<br> Everyone's concerned about her,<br> where she might be.<br> Listen, you know,<br> when you're getting out of rehab,<br> it's very, very difficult<br> and it's especially difficult to go<br> to see your family. I mean, it just...<br> I mean, when I...<br> When I got out, I didn't see them for years.<br> And it just really takes time,<br> and I... And...<br> If you're not ready to take<br> responsibility for something,<br> people make something up,<br> which is probably what happened, but...<br> I mean, you know,<br> honestly, Rachel, that happened like...<br> It was a couple of years ago...<br> Paul, do you want me to go out<br> and look for her?<br> No.<br> You can't. I mean, you have<br> a wedding tomorrow. A hundred people...<br> I'll go. I mean, you know...<br> It's fine. I'll go.<br> - Where are you going to go?<br> - I can take a look for her.<br> Do you guys know where she might be, or...<br> Hello?<br> I'm sorry?<br> It's the caterer.<br> - Let me deal with it.<br> - I'll tell you what.<br> Hello?<br> You should really call Daddy, honey.<br> Yeah, okay. In a minute.<br> - You know how he worries.<br> - I will in a minute, yeah.<br> You know, he's worried, honey.<br> I need a glass of water.<br> Here. I made tea.<br> Come sit down, honey. You look so upset.<br> Is Andrew going to be home soon?<br> Yes. He just went to a dinner. Not late.<br> Did something happen<br> with you and Rachel?<br> Is everything all right with the wedding?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Good.<br> Why did you leave me in charge of him?<br> You knew. All of you knew.<br> - Kym.<br> - People told you.<br> I was a junkie. I was a crazy drug addict.<br> - I stole from you.<br> - Yes.<br> I lied to your face.<br> I weighed six pounds.<br> My hair was falling out.<br> - I spent every dinner in the bathroom.<br> - Honey, you were sick.<br> - That was an illness.<br> - You know what I was.<br> I stayed in my room for days.<br> I passed out all the time.<br> No, no.<br> - What were you thinking?<br> - No.<br> Why did you leave me?<br> I was there. I didn't leave you.<br> Why would you leave me in charge of him?<br> Because you were good with him.<br> - Mom, Mom, why would you leave...<br> - No, you were...<br> ...a drug addict to watch your son?<br> No! You were good with him!<br> - You were the best you were with him!<br> - Listen to me! Listen!<br> I didn't expect you to kill him, sweetheart!<br> - You were not supposed to kill him!<br> - Mom!<br> Mom! What are you doing? Get off!<br> - Oh, God! God!<br> - Mom!<br> Fuck.<br> Are you okay, miss?<br> Right over here. It's a mess.<br> It's Kym. I'm fine.<br> I...<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - No problem.<br> Hi.<br> I'm the maid of honor.<br> Cool. I know you.<br> I used to work at that dog-grooming place.<br> You holding?<br> - Kymmie?<br> - Oh, God, Dad.<br> - Kymmie, are... Oh, God. Are you all right?<br> - Yeah. I just need to go.<br> No, we've got to get to the hospital.<br> No, Dad. I need to get dressed.<br> - Kymmie, we've got to get you<br> to a hospital. - I'm fine, please.<br> Kym, you can't just vanish.<br> You can't just leave.<br> You have to call, now.<br> You always have to call.<br> I know.<br> Fuck.<br> Come here.<br> - Fuck. I'm sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> Goes in, like, 12 directions.<br> I'm so happy you're home.<br> And see if you can fold it<br> into three pieces at the top.<br> Okay, hold on. Let me try.<br> You were right about the gray.<br> - Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel<br> - Sidney, Sidney, Sidney, Sidney<br> - Rachel, Rachel<br> - Sidney, Sidney<br> We've come together<br> to show our support for<br> Sidney and Rachel in theirjoining hands<br> and in joining themselves together<br> in holy wedlock.<br> The weather's been pretty miserable<br> all weekend, but now it's a beautiful day.<br> And it's a beautiful day because<br> when two people come together<br> who really love one another<br> and want to share that with other people,<br> it makes it a beautiful day.<br> So Sidney Williams and Rachel Buchman<br> have come do to that.<br> And, Rachel, you go first.<br> Paul Buchman likes to say<br> that the measure of a great life is<br> not how well loved you are,<br> but how well you love others.<br> Sidney, you teach me that every day.<br> You are just so full of grace,<br> and I promise before God<br> and these beautiful people<br> that I will love you fiercely<br> and sweetly.<br> And I look forward to sharing<br> that great life with you.<br> Thank you for marrying me.<br> All that I ever wanted was<br> to just hear music,<br> and when I met you, I heard you.<br> And, Rachel, you're the most beautiful thing<br> I've ever heard.<br> Thank you for marrying me.<br> You're welcome.<br> She used to work in a diner<br> Never saw a woman look finer<br> I used to orderjust to watch her<br> float across the floor<br> She grew up in a small town<br> Never put her roots down<br> Daddy always kept moving, so she did, too<br> You know it ain't easy<br> You got to hold on<br> She was an unknown legend in her time<br> Now she's dressing two kids<br> Looking for a magic kiss<br> She gets the faraway look in her eyes<br> Somewhere on a desert highway<br> She rides a Harley-Davidson<br> Her long brown hair flying in the wind<br> She's been running half her life<br> The chrome and steel she rides<br> colliding with<br> The very air she breathes<br> The air she breathes<br> Do we have some rings?<br> Sidney, you go first<br> and place the ring on Rachel's hand.<br> Do you?<br> Yeah, I do.<br> Sidney does. Do you, Rachel?<br> I do.<br> All right.<br> By the power vested in me by<br> the state of Connecticut and by Neil Young,<br> I pronounce that they are husband and wife,<br> and now you can kiss him.<br> Okay. We're going to cut the cake.<br> Everybody who wants to see it, come now.<br> Tastes like lime and turmeric.<br> It's got, like, turmeric in it.<br> Baby Boy, let them take the picture.<br> Yeah, Baby Boy.<br> Can we all do this together?<br> Everybody.<br> Kym?<br> Wait. Where's... Where's Kym?<br> I'm here.<br> Mom?<br> - Dear God...<br> - Wait, wait, wait. Mom.<br> Okay, look at the camera. One, two, three.<br> That's great. Thank you.<br> Dear God, please bless this family and<br> let them always invite us over for dinner,<br> because God knows<br> my new wife cannot boil water or fry an egg.<br> And now a word from our sponsor.<br> Mr. Buchman, if you please!<br> I'm getting now to the Williams family.<br> It's a done deal. We're relatives.<br> We were fortunate that they could be<br> joined by Specialist Joseph Gonzales.<br> Son, we want you home and we want you<br> to put that damn camera down.<br> Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - Sorry.<br> No. Come in.<br> Come on.<br> Have you seen Mom?<br> No, she's probably taking a break.<br> How do you take a break from your own<br> daughter's wedding?<br> You know Mom. She doesn't really...<br> Oh, yeah. Here's the party?<br> Okay, this is too cute for me.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello?<br> Rachel. Well, here you all are.<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> Hey.<br> So lovely. I'm truly...<br> - Abby?<br> - Yeah?<br> - They're bringing the car around.<br> - Okay. Great.<br> Wait. You're leaving?<br> Honey, I'm so exhausted,<br> but I had such a marvelous time.<br> Everything was great. Carol and Daddy<br> really did a great job, don't you think?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay, I just didn't want to make a<br> big scene. We're just going to slip away.<br> - You could make a little scene.<br> - Well, I'm making it. Right?<br> Andrew and I have to go to Washington<br> tomorrow. So we're going to take off.<br> Why are you going to Washington?<br> I thought I told you. No?<br> We'll just be a week.<br> We have a bunch of meetings. But you guys<br> are going away real soon, right?<br> What about our post-nuptial<br> wedding gossip reconnaissance, Mom?<br> Well, you could come by in the morning.<br> Yeah...<br> No, no, that's a stupid idea. Don't call<br> me early. It's your wedding night.<br> You're not going to get up early.<br> That was silly. Anyway...<br> I have to get Andrew ready<br> 'cause he's absolutely hopeless in this way.<br> So...<br> We'll just be a bit and then we'll be back.<br> Everything was so lovely,<br> even the weather cooperated.<br> It was beautiful, honey. Okay.<br> Wait.<br> I want my mother and my sister.<br> - Congratulations, Daddy.<br> - Thanks.<br> All right, Rachel.<br> - All right, Rach. Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - You'll call me every day about you know...<br> - Yes. Of course.<br> - You take care. All right?<br> - Bye.<br> - Son-in-law.<br> - Mother-in-law.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> - Paul, Carol, it was so lovely.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Get some rest.<br> - Okay.<br> I can't find my cigarettes.<br> Just give me a second.<br> Kymmie. Kym.<br> You remember Susanna Galeano?<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, Kym. How are you?<br> Suzy runs a first rate PR firm and, darling,<br> she has just lost an office assistant.<br> We really are down a person.<br> And I was wondering,<br> have you ever<br> thought about public relations?<br> The public's kind of afraid of me.<br> Listen, Suzy<br> is opening a new office right here.<br> - Darling, you could be at home.<br> - I tell you what.<br> - Why don't you call me on Monday?<br> - Give her a card.<br> - And we can talk about it?<br> - That would be great.<br> - This is just too perfect.<br> - It's stuck, here we go.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Paul, it was beautiful.<br> - I'm gonna have to go.<br> - Suzy, Suzy, thank you. I know.<br> You look wonderful.<br> Do you want me<br> to hold that card now for you?<br> No, no. I got it. Just... Give me a second.<br> I'll be back in a minute.<br> Okay.<br> Hello?<br> You making a break for it?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I got to go.<br> Yeah. Okay.<br> If you ever need anything...<br> If I need to post bond?<br> No. If you ever need anything.<br> Thank you.<br> Maybe you'll come visit me in Hawaii.<br> - That would be nice.<br> - Yes, it would.<br> - I got to go.<br> - Okay.<br> - I got it.<br> - Okay.<br> Kym.<br> Daddy?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - How you feeling?<br> - I'm okay.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> You should probably just ignore the eye.<br> It's a long story.<br> - Okay.<br> - Kymmie.<br> Hey.<br> - Hey, I'm Kym's sister.<br> - Hi.<br> - This is Rosa.<br> - Rachel.<br> Rachel, I heard a lot about you.<br> You got married.<br> - I did, yeah.<br> - Congratulations.<br> Thank you.<br> I love your baby.<br> Me, too.<br> - Great.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br>
