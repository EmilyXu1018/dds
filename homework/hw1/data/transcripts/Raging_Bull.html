A horse!<br> My kingdom for a horse!"<br> I haven't had a winner<br> in six months.<br> And though I'm no Olivier,<br> I would much rather...<br> And though I'm no Olivier,<br> if he fought Sugar Ray,<br> he would say that the thing<br> ain't the ring, it's the play.<br> So, give me a stage where<br> this bull here can rage,<br> and though I can fight,<br> I'd much rather recite.<br> That's entertainment.<br> That's entertainment.<br> Jake La Motta<br> and Jimmy Reeves<br> in the Cleveland Arena.<br> La Motta is undefeated,<br> but he's well behind on points.<br> The Bronx Bull has taken<br> a lot of punishment in this bout.<br> Jake is cut around the left eye.<br> Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...<br> Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we<br> have to come to Cleveland for you<br> to get beaten by a mulignane?<br> Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.<br> He's got you by the balls,<br> you're outpointed.<br> You're comin' up for the tenth,<br> you're gonna have to knock him out.<br> I want you to bite him, kick him,<br> do anything you gotta do.<br> Nobody's lookin',<br> you know what to do.<br> Just like home--<br> all over the fuckin' moolies.<br> Knock the motherfucker out.<br> You understand?
