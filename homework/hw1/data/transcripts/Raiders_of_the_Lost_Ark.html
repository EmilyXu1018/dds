Okay, that's it<br> for the day, then.<br> Um, don't forget...<br> Michaelson, chapters four<br> and five for next time.<br> And I will be in my office<br> on Thursday, but not Wednesday.<br> I had it, Marcus.<br> I had it in my hand.<br> What happened?<br> Guess.<br> Belloq?<br> You want to hear about it?<br> Not at all.<br> I'm sure everything you do<br> for the museum<br> conforms to<br> the International Treaty<br> for the Protection<br> of Antiquities.<br> It's beautiful, Marcus.<br> I can get it.<br> I got it all figured out.<br> There's only one place<br> he can sell it: Marrakech.<br> I need $2,000. Look...<br> Listen to me, old boy.<br> I brought some people<br> to see you.<br> Look.<br> I got these pieces.<br> They're good pieces, Marcus.<br> - Look.<br> - Indiana...<br> Yes, the museum will buy them,<br> as usual, no questions asked.<br> Yes, they are nice.<br> They're worth at least<br> the price<br> of a ticket to Marrakech.<br> But the people<br> I brought are important,<br> and they're waiting.<br> What people?<br> Army Intelligence.<br> They knew you were coming<br> before I did.<br> Seem to know everything.<br> They wouldn't tell me<br> what they want.<br> Well, what do I want<br> to see them for?<br> What am I, in trouble?<br> Yes, Dr. Jones,<br> we've heard a great deal<br> about you.<br> Have you?<br> Uh, professor of archaeology,<br> expert on the occult,<br> and, uh, how does one say it?<br> Obtainer of rare antiquities.<br> That's one way of saying it.<br> Why don't you sit down?<br> You'll be more comfortable.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yes, you're a man<br> of many talents.<br> Now, you studied<br> under Professor Ravenwood<br> at the University of Chicago.<br> Yes, I did.<br> You have no idea<br> of his present whereabouts?<br> Uh... well, just rumors, really.<br> Somewhere in Asia, I think.<br> I haven't really spoken<br> to him for ten years.<br> We were friends, but, uh...<br> had a bit of a falling out,<br> I'm afraid.<br> Mmm.<br> Dr. Jones, now,<br> you must understand<br> that this is all<br> strictly confidential, eh?<br> I understand.<br> Uh...<br> Yesterday afternoon,<br> our European sections<br> intercepted a...<br> a German communiqu<br> that was sent<br> from Cairo to Berlin.<br> - Now, to Cairo...<br> - See, over the last two years,<br> the Nazis have had teams<br> of archaeologists<br> running around the world<br> looking for all kinds<br> of religious artifacts.<br> Hitler's a nut on the subject.<br> He's crazy.<br> He's obsessed with the occult.<br> And, right now, apparently,<br> there's some kind<br> of German archaeological dig<br> going on in the desert<br> outside of Cairo.<br> Now, we've got some<br> information here,<br> but we can't make anything<br> out of it, and maybe you can.<br> "Tanis development proceeding.<br> "Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.<br> Abner Ravenwood, U.S."<br> The Nazis have discovered Tanis.<br> Just what does that mean to you,<br> uh, Tanis?<br> Well, it...<br> The city of Tanis<br> is one of the possible<br> resting places of the Lost Ark.<br> The Lost Ark?<br> Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.<br> The chest the Hebrews used<br> to carry around<br> the Ten Commandments.<br> What do you mean,<br> "commandments"?<br> You talking<br> about the Ten Commandments?<br> Yes, the actual<br> Ten Commandments.<br> The original stone tablets<br> that Moses brought down<br> out of Mount Horeb and smashed,<br> if you believe<br> in that sort of thing.<br> Any of you guys<br> ever go to Sunday school?<br> Well, I...<br> Oh, look.<br> The Hebrews took<br> the broken pieces<br> and put them in the Ark.<br> When they settled in Canaan,<br> they put the Ark in a place<br> called the Temple of Solomon.<br> In Jerusalem.<br> Where it stayed for many years.<br> Until, all of a sudden,<br> whoosh, it's gone.<br> Where?<br> Well, nobody knows<br> where or when.<br> However, an Egyptian pharaoh...<br> - Shishak.<br> - Yes.<br> ...invaded the city of Jerusalem<br> right about 980 BC,<br> and he may have taken the Ark<br> back to the city of Tanis<br> and hidden it<br> in a secret chamber<br> called the Well of Souls.<br> Secret chamber?<br> However, about a year<br> after the pharaoh<br> would return to Egypt,<br> the city of Tanis was<br> consumed by the desert<br> in a sandstorm which<br> lasted a whole year.<br> Wiped clean by the wrath of God.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Obviously, we've come<br> to the right men.<br> Now you seem to know, uh,<br> all about this Tanis, then.<br> No, no, not really.<br> Ravenwood is the real expert.<br> Abner did the first serious work<br> on Tanis.<br> Collected some of its relics.<br> It was his obsession, really.<br> But he never found the city.<br> Frankly, we're somewhat<br> suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.<br> An American being mentioned<br> so prominently<br> in a secret Nazi cable.<br> Oh, rubbish.<br> Ravenwood's no Nazi.<br> Well, what do the Nazis<br> want him for, then?<br> Well, obviously,<br> the Nazis are looking<br> for the headpiece<br> to the Staff of Ra<br> and they think Abner's got it.<br> What exactly is a headpiece<br> to the Staff of Ra?<br> Well, the staff<br> is just a stick...<br> I don't know, about this big,<br> nobody really knows<br> for sure how high...<br> and it's... it's, uh...<br> it's capped<br> with an elaborate headpiece...<br> in the shape of the sun,<br> with a crystal in the center.<br> And what you did was<br> you take the staff<br> to a special room in Tanis...<br> a map room with a miniature<br> of the city all laid out<br> on the floor...<br> and if you put the staff<br> in a certain place,<br> at a certain time of day,<br> the sun shone through here<br> and made a beam that came down<br> on the floor here...<br> and gave you the exact location<br> of the Well of the Souls.<br> Where the Ark of the Covenant<br> was kept, right?<br> Which is exactly what the Nazis<br> are looking for.<br> What does this Ark look like?<br> Uh...<br> There's a picture of it<br> right here.<br> That's it.<br> Good God.<br> Yes, that's just<br> what the Hebrews thought.<br> Uh...<br> now, what's that supposed to be<br> coming out of there?<br> Lightning...<br> fire...<br> power of God or something.<br> I'm beginning to understand<br> Hitler's interest in this.<br> Oh, yes.<br> The Bible speaks of the<br> Ark leveling mountains,<br> and laying waste<br> to entire regions.<br> An army which carries<br> the Ark before it...<br> is invincible.<br> You did it, didn't you?<br> They want you to go for it.<br> Oh, Marcus!<br> They want you to get ahold of<br> the Ark before the Nazis do<br> and they're prepared<br> to pay handsomely for it.<br> And the museum?<br> The museum gets the Ark<br> when we're finished?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Oh...<br> The Ark of the Covenant.<br> Nothing else has come close.<br> That thing represents everything<br> we got into archaeology<br> for in the first place.<br> Mmm!<br> You know, five years ago,<br> I would've gone after it myself.<br> I'm really rather envious.<br> I've got to locate Abner.<br> I think I know where to start.<br> Suppose she'll<br> still be with him?<br> Possibly, but...<br> Marion's the least<br> of your worries right now,<br> believe me, Indy.<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, I mean that<br> for nearly 3,000 years,<br> man has been searching<br> for the Lost Ark.<br> Not something to be taken<br> lightly.<br> No one knows its secrets.<br> It's like nothing you've ever<br> gone after before.<br> Oh, Marcus.<br> What are you trying to do,<br> scare me?<br> You sound like my mother.<br> We've known each other<br> for a long time.<br> I don't believe in magic,<br> a lot of superstitious<br> hocus-pocus.<br> I'm going after a find<br> of incredible<br> historical significance.<br> You're talking<br> about the bogeyman.<br> Besides, you know<br> what a cautious fellow I am.<br> Nice to see you again,<br> Dr. Jones.<br> Thank you.<br> Shh... shh...<br> Shh...<br> Give him space!<br> Give him space!<br> Go on, Regan!<br> Shh! Shh!<br> Shh! Shh! Shh!<br> Hello, Marion.<br> Indiana Jones.<br> Always knew, someday,<br> you'd come walking back<br> through my door.<br> I never doubted that.<br> Something made it inevitable.<br> So, what are you doing here<br> in Nepal?<br> I need one of the pieces<br> your father collected.<br> I learned to hate you<br> in the last ten years.<br> I never meant to hurt you.<br> I was a child.<br> I was in love.<br> It was wrong and you knew it!<br> You knew what you were doing.<br> Now I do!<br> This is my place.<br> Get out!<br> I did what I did.<br> You don't have to be happy<br> about it,<br> but maybe we could help<br> each other out now.<br> I need one of the pieces<br> your father collected.<br> Bronze piece, about this size,<br> with a hole in it, off-center,<br> with a crystal.<br> You know the one I mean?<br> Yeah.<br> I know it.<br> Where's Abner?<br> Where's Abner?<br> Abner's dead.<br> Marion, I'm sorry.<br> Do you know what you did to me,<br> to my life?<br> I can only say<br> I'm sorry so many times.<br> Well, say it again, anyway.<br> Sorry.<br> Yeah, everybody's sorry.<br> Abner was sorry for dragging me<br> all over this earth<br> looking<br> for his little bits of junk.<br> I'm sorry to still be<br> stuck in this dive.<br> Everybody's sorry for something.<br> It's a worthless bronze<br> medallion, Marion.<br> You going to give it to me?<br> Maybe.<br> I don't know where it is.<br> Well, maybe you could find it.<br> Well, that will get me back,<br> but not in style.<br> I can get you another two<br> when we get to the States.<br> It's important, Marion.<br> Trust me.<br> You know the piece I mean?<br> Do you know where it is?<br> Come back tomorrow.<br> Why?<br> Because I said so, that's why.<br> Ha!<br> See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.<br> Good evening, Fraulein.<br> The bar's closed.<br> We... We are...<br> not thirsty.<br> What do you want?<br> The same thing your friend<br> Dr. Jones wanted.<br> Surely he told you<br> there would be<br> other interested parties.<br> Must've slipped his mind.<br> The man is... nefarious.<br> I hope, for your sake,<br> he has not yet acquired it.<br> Why, are you willing<br> to offer more?<br> Oh, almost certainly.<br> Do you still have it?<br> No.<br> But I know where it is.<br> Hey, how about a drink<br> for you and your men?<br> Your fire is dying here.<br> Why don't you tell me<br> where the piece is right now?<br> Listen, Herr Mac...<br> I don't know what kind of people<br> you're used to dealing with,<br> but nobody tells me<br> what to do in my place.<br> Fraulein Ravenwood,<br> let me show you<br> what I am used to.<br> Take your hands off me!<br> Take your lousy hands off!<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait, I... I can be reasonable.<br> That time is passed.<br> You don't need that.<br> Wait...<br> I'll tell you everything.<br> Yes, I know you will.<br> Let her go.<br> Whiskey.<br> Shoot them.<br> Shoot them both.<br> My medallion!<br> Well, Jones, at least<br> you haven't forgotten<br> how to show a lady a good time!<br> Boy, you're something!<br> Yeah, I'll tell you what.<br> Until I get back my $5,000,<br> you're going to get more<br> than you bargained for.<br> I'm your goddamn partner!<br> Cairo, city of the living.<br> A paradise on earth.<br> Silence!<br> Why do you forget yourselves?<br> What is this?<br> Where did this animal come from?<br> Oh... oh, no.<br> Cute.<br> What an adorable creature.<br> Then it shall be welcome<br> in our house.<br> Oh, well, no, you don't have to<br> keep it here just because of me.<br> I knew the Germans<br> would hire you, Sallah.<br> You're the best digger in Egypt.<br> My services are entirely<br> inconsequential to them.<br> They've hired or shanghaied<br> every digger in Cairo.<br> The excavation is enormous.<br> They hire only strong backs<br> and they pay pennies for them.<br> It's as if the pharaohs<br> had returned.<br> When did they find the map room?<br> Three days ago.<br> They have not one brain<br> among them.<br> Except one.<br> He is very clever.<br> He's a French archaeologist.<br> What's his name?<br> They call him "Bellosh."<br> Belloq. Belloq.<br> The Germans have<br> a great advantage over us.<br> They are near to discovering<br> the Well of Souls.<br> Well, they're not<br> going to find it without this.<br> Who can tell us<br> about these markings?<br> Perhaps a man I know<br> can help us.<br> Indy...<br> there is something<br> that troubles me.<br> What is it?<br> The Ark.<br> If it is there, at Tanis,<br> then it is something that man<br> was not meant to disturb.<br> Death has always surrounded it.<br> It is not of this earth.<br> Do we need the monkey, huh?<br> I'm surprised at you, Jones...<br> talking that way about our baby.<br> He's got your looks, too.<br> And your brains.<br> Oops!<br> I noticed that.<br> She's a smart little thing...<br> smart.<br> Hey!<br> Hey, where you going?<br> She'll be all right.<br> Have a date.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Okay...<br> Marion.<br> What's this?<br> It's a date.<br> You eat 'em.<br> How come you haven't found some<br> nice girl to settle down with,<br> raise eight or nine kids,<br> like your friend Sallah?<br> Who says I haven't?<br> I do.<br> Dad had you figured<br> a long time ago.<br> He said you were a bum.<br> Oh, he's being generous.<br> The most gifted bum<br> he ever trained.<br> You know, he loved you<br> like a son.<br> Took a hell of a lot<br> for you to alienate him.<br> Not much, just you.<br> Marion, get out of here!<br> Duck!<br> Right.<br> Shh! Shh!<br> Marion!<br> Help! Over here, Indy!<br> Get out of the way!<br> Move! Move it!<br> Help me!<br> You can't do this to me!<br> I'm an American!<br> Indy!<br> Indiana Jones!<br> Help me, Jones!<br> Jones!<br> Marion!<br> Indy!<br> Marion...<br> Dr. Jones.<br> You looking for me?<br> Belloq.<br> Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.<br> I ought to kill you right now.<br> Not a very private place<br> for a murder.<br> Well, these Arabs don't care<br> if we kill each other.<br> They're not going<br> to interfere in our business.<br> It was not I who brought<br> the girl into this business.<br> Please, sit down<br> before you fall down.<br> We can at least behave<br> like civilized people.<br> I see your taste in friends<br> remains consistent.<br> How odd that it should end<br> this way for us,<br> after so many<br> stimulating encounters.<br> I almost regret it.<br> Where shall I find<br> a new adversary<br> so close to my own level?<br> Try the local sewer.<br> You and I are very much alike.<br> Archaeology is our religion,<br> yet we have both fallen<br> from the purer faith.<br> Our methods have not differed<br> as much as you pretend.<br> I am a shadowy<br> reflection of you.<br> It would take only a nudge<br> to make you like me,<br> to push you out of the light.<br> Now you're getting nasty.<br> You know it's true.<br> How nice.<br> Look at this.<br> It's worthless.<br> Ten dollars<br> from a vendor in the street.<br> But I take it,<br> I bury it in the sand<br> for a thousand years,<br> it becomes priceless...<br> like the Ark.<br> Men will kill for it.<br> Men like you and me.<br> What about your boss,<br> der Fuehrer?<br> I thought he was waiting<br> to take possession.<br> All in good time.<br> When I am finished with it.<br> Jones, do you realize<br> what the Ark is?<br> It's a transmitter.<br> It's a radio<br> for speaking to God.<br> And it's within my reach.<br> You want to talk to God?<br> Let's go see Him together.<br> I've got nothing better to do.<br> Uncle Indy, come back home now!<br> Uncle Indy!<br> Next time, Indiana Jones,<br> it'll take more than children<br> to save you.<br> Uncle Indy!<br> I thought I would<br> find you there.<br> Better than the United<br> States Marines, eh?<br> Marion's dead.<br> Yes, I know.<br> And me! And me!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Life goes on, Indy.<br> There is the proof.<br> Uh-oh.<br> I have much to tell you.<br> First we will take them home,<br> and then I will take you<br> to the old man.<br> I can't figure out<br> how Belloq did it.<br> Where'd he get a copy<br> of the headpiece?<br> There are no pictures,<br> no duplicates of it anywhere.<br> I tell you only what I saw<br> with my own eyes:<br> A headpiece like that one,<br> except round the edges,<br> which were rougher.<br> In the center, the Frenchman<br> had embedded a crystal,<br> and... and surrounding<br> the crystal, on one side,<br> there were raised markings,<br> just like that one.<br> They made their calculations<br> in the map room?<br> This morning.<br> Belloq and the boss German,<br> Dietrich.<br> When they came out<br> of the map room,<br> they gave us a new spot<br> in which to dig,<br> out away from the camp.<br> The Well of the Souls, huh?<br> Come, come, look.<br> Look here... look.<br> Sit down.<br> Come, sit down.<br> What is it?<br> This is a warning<br> not to disturb<br> the Ark of the Covenant.<br> What about the height<br> of the staff, though?<br> Did Belloq get it off of here?<br> Yes.<br> It is here.<br> This were the old way,<br> this mean six kadam high.<br> - About 72 inches.<br> - Wait!<br> "And take back one kadam<br> to honor the Hebrew God<br> whose Ark this is."<br> You said their headpiece<br> only had markings on one side.<br> Are you absolutely sure?<br> Belloq's staff is too long.<br> They're digging<br> in the wrong place.<br> I am the monarch of the sea<br> I am the ruler of the...<br> Bad dates.<br> I told you not to be premature<br> in your communiqu to Berlin.<br> Archaeology is not<br> an exact science.<br> It does not deal<br> in time schedules.<br> The fuehrer is not<br> a patient man.<br> He demands constant reports,<br> and he expects progress.<br> You led me to believe...<br> Nothing!<br> I made no promises.<br> I only said<br> it looked very favorable.<br> Besides, with the information<br> in our possession,<br> my calculations were correct.<br> Boy, they're not kidding,<br> are they?<br> What time does the sun<br> hit the map room?<br> At about 9:00 in the morning.<br> Not much time, then.<br> Where are they digging<br> for the Well of the Souls?<br> On that ridge...<br> but the map room's over there.<br> Let's go, come on.<br> Sallah.<br> Sallah!<br> They're here.<br> Please, my friend,<br> what is the matter?<br> I fetch the water.<br> I shall get it for you.<br> If you want water,<br> I will get you water.<br> No problem, no problem.<br> I thought you were dead.<br> You must have switched baskets.<br> Are you hurt?<br> No. You have to get me<br> out of here, quick.<br> They're gonna be back<br> at any minute.<br> Cut me loose.<br> Quick.<br> They keep asking about you.<br> What you know.<br> What's wrong?<br> Cut me loose.<br> I know where the Ark is, Marion.<br> The Ark's here?<br> I'm coming with you, Jones.<br> Get me out of here!<br> Cut me loose!<br> You can't leave me here!<br> If I take you out of here now,<br> they'll start combing<br> the place for us.<br> Jones, you've got to get me<br> out of here!<br> Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!<br> Marion, I hate to do this,<br> but if you don't sit<br> still and keep quiet,<br> this whole thing<br> is going to be shot.<br> I'll be back to get you.<br> Jones, what's the matter?<br> That's it.<br> Who knows?<br> Perhaps the Ark is still waiting<br> in some antechamber<br> for us to discover.<br> Perhaps there's some vital<br> bit of evidence which eludes us.<br> Perhaps...<br> Perhaps the girl can help us.<br> My feeling exactly.<br> She was in possession<br> of the original piece for years.<br> She may know much,<br> if properly motivated.<br> I tell you,<br> the girl knows nothing.<br> I'm surprised<br> to find you squeamish.<br> That is not your reputation.<br> But it needn't concern you.<br> I have the perfect man<br> for this kind of work.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> Indy! Here!<br> We've hit stone!<br> Clear it off.<br> Come on, find the edges.<br> Good, good, good.<br> You see, Indy? You see?<br> Okay, bring the pry bars in.<br> As a team, boys! As a team!<br> Push!<br> Get 'em in there.<br> Get 'em under.<br> Good, good, that's it.<br> Watch your toes.<br> Carefully, carefully!<br> Sorry, Indy.<br> Indy...<br> why does the floor move?<br> Give me your torch.<br> Snakes.<br> Why did it have to be snakes?<br> Asps.<br> Very dangerous.<br> You go first.<br> If you're trying<br> to escape on foot,<br> the desert is three weeks<br> in every direction,<br> so please, eat something.<br> I must apologize<br> for their treatment of you.<br> Yeah. Whose idea was it?<br> No food, no water.<br> What kind of people<br> are these friends of yours?<br> At this particular time<br> and place, to do my work,<br> they are necessary evils.<br> They're not my friends.<br> However, with the<br> right connections,<br> even in this part of the world,<br> we are not entirely uncivilized.<br> It's beautiful.<br> I would very much like<br> to see you in it.<br> I'll bet you would.<br> All right.<br> What do you got to drink<br> around here?<br> We don't have much time.<br> Soon they will come to harm you,<br> Soon they will come to harm you,<br> and I will not be able<br> to stop them,<br> unless you are able<br> to give me something<br> to placate them.<br> Some, uh, piece<br> of information...<br> which I can use<br> to protect you from them.<br> I've already told you<br> everything I know.<br> I have no loyalty to Jones.<br> He's brought me<br> nothing but trouble.<br> Marion, you are beautiful.<br> I don't think<br> we need a chaperone.<br> Steadily.<br> Steadily. Whoa!<br> Down...<br> Down... Whoa.<br> Carefully, carefully!<br> You all right, Indy?<br> Now gently, boys.<br> Gently, gently!<br> Whoa...<br> I told you it will be all right.<br> Huh...<br> Sallah, get down here!<br> You pour.<br> Oh, that's good.<br> Whoops.<br> What is this stuff, Rene?<br> I grew up with this.<br> It's my family label.<br> Well... I have to be<br> going now, Rene.<br> I like you, Rene, very much.<br> Perhaps we'll meet someday<br> under better circumstances.<br> We meet again, Fraulein.<br> You Americans,<br> you're all the same.<br> Always overdressing<br> for the wrong occasions.<br> Now...<br> what shall we talk about?<br> All right... take it up!<br> Easy!<br> You're as stubborn as that girl.<br> You like her too much, I think.<br> Your methods of archaeology<br> are too primitive for me.<br> You would use a bulldozer<br> to find a... China cup.<br> Shliemann! Wake your men!<br> Indy, the torches<br> are burning out.<br> Go on, get out of here.<br> Hyah!<br> Sallah!<br> Hello!<br> Hello!<br> Why, Dr. Jones,<br> whatever are you doing<br> in such a nasty place?<br> Why don't you come on down here!<br> I'll show you!<br> Thank you, my friend,<br> but I think we are all<br> very comfortable up here.<br> That's right, isn't it?<br> Yes, we are very comfortable<br> up here.<br> So, once again, Jones,<br> what was briefly yours<br> is now mine.<br> What a fitting end<br> to your life's pursuits.<br> You're about to become<br> a permanent addition<br> to this archaeological find.<br> Who knows?<br> In a thousand years,<br> even you may be worth something.<br> Son of a bitch.<br> I'm afraid we must be<br> going now, Dr. Jones.<br> Our prize is awaited in Berlin.<br> But I do not wish to leave you<br> down in that awful place<br> all alone.<br> Slimy pig, you let me go!<br> Stop it!<br> Marion!<br> Hang on.<br> Don't...<br> - Indy!<br> - Don't fall!<br> Marion, I got you!<br> I got you! I got you!<br> You traitor!<br> You get your hands off of me!<br> Snakes!<br> Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!<br> The girl was mine!<br> She's of no use to us.<br> Only our mission<br> for the fuehrer matters.<br> I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,<br> if you have that<br> clearly in mind.<br> It was not to be, chrie.<br> You bastards!<br> I'll get you for this!<br> Indiana Jones...<br> adieu.<br> No!<br> Take this.<br> Wave it at anything<br> that slithers.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, my God, this whole<br> place is slithering.<br> Indy!<br> Ow! Jesus!<br> Where did you get this?<br> From him?<br> I was trying to escape.<br> No thanks to you.<br> How hard were you trying?<br> Well, where the hell were you?<br> Watch it, watch it.<br> What are you doing?!<br> For the fire!<br> How the hell are we going<br> to get out of here?<br> I'm working on it!<br> I'm working on it!<br> Well, whatever you're<br> doing, do it faster.<br> Ah...<br> Where are you going?<br> Through that wall.<br> Just get ready to run,<br> whatever happens to me.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> Indy!<br> Damn it! Don't you leave me<br> down here by myself!<br> Indy!<br> Here we go!<br> Get ready!<br> Indy, the torch is going out!<br> Indy?<br> Marion!<br> Look. Look.<br> They're going to fly it<br> out of here.<br> When that Ark gets loaded,<br> we're already going<br> to be on the plane.<br> Ah, monsieur, let us toast<br> our success in the desert.<br> To the Ark.<br> When we are very far<br> from here.<br> That will do.<br> Hey, you now... come here!<br> Come here!<br> Indy!<br> Stay with the Ark!<br> Stay with the Ark!<br> Look out!<br> Oh, my God.<br> Marion.<br> In here! Up here!<br> Indy, come on!<br> Hold on!<br> Move up!<br> It's gonna blow up!<br> It's stuck! Indy!<br> I can't push it off!<br> It's stuck!<br> - Turn it! Turn it!<br> - It's stuck!<br> Turn it there!<br> Never mind!<br> Get back! Get back!<br> Get the Ark away from<br> this place immediately.<br> Have it put on the truck.<br> We'll fly it out of Cairo.<br> And Gobler, I want<br> plenty of protection.<br> Jones.<br> Holy smoke, my friends,<br> I... I'm so pleased<br> you're not dead!<br> Indy, Indy, we have no time.<br> If you still want the Ark,<br> it is being loaded<br> onto a truck for Cairo.<br> Truck?<br> What truck?<br> Let's go!<br> Get back to Cairo.<br> Get us some transport<br> to England...<br> boat, plane, anything.<br> Meet me at Omar's.<br> Be ready for me.<br> I'm going after that truck.<br> How?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm making this up as I go.<br> Ew!<br> He's there!<br> Idiot! Idiot!<br> Everything at last<br> has been arranged.<br> The Ark?<br> Is on board.<br> Nothing is lacking,<br> now that you're here.<br> Or what is left of you.<br> You trust these guys?<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Katanga.<br> Mr. Katanga,<br> these are my friends.<br> They are my family.<br> I will hear of it<br> if they are not treated well.<br> My cabin is theirs.<br> Mr. Jones...<br> I've heard a lot about you, sir.<br> Your appearance is exactly<br> the way I imagined.<br> Good-bye.<br> Look out for each other.<br> I am already missing you.<br> You're my good friend.<br> Sallah.<br> That is for Fayah...<br> that is for your children...<br> and this is for you.<br> Thank you.<br> A British tar is a soaring soul<br> As free as a mountain bird<br> His energetic fist<br> should be ready to...<br> ...a dictator...<br> Where did you go?<br> I'm cleaning up.<br> Where'd you get that?<br> From him.<br> Who him?<br> Katanga.<br> I got a feeling<br> I'm not the first woman<br> ever to travel<br> with these pirates.<br> It's lovely.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah.<br> Really?<br> Yeah.<br> What'd you say?<br> Wait... I don't need any help.<br> You know you do.<br> You're not the man<br> I knew ten years ago.<br> It's not the years, honey,<br> it's the mileage.<br> You are...<br> Please, I don't need a nurse.<br> - I just want to sleep.<br> - Don't be such a baby.<br> Marion, leave me alone.<br> - What is this here?<br> - Go away.<br> Yes, it hurts.<br> Ow!<br> Well, goddamn it, Indy,<br> where doesn't it hurt?<br> Here.<br> Here.<br> This isn't too bad.<br> Here.<br> Jones...<br> Jones?!<br> We never seem to get<br> a break, do we?<br> What is it?<br> Engines have stopped.<br> I'm going to go check.<br> What's happening?<br> We have most important friends.<br> Holy shit.<br> I sent my man for you.<br> You and the girl must disappear.<br> We have a place in the hold.<br> Come on, go, go, go.<br> Come on, go, my friend, go.<br> Where is Dr. Jones?<br> What's the big idea?<br> Let go!<br> Don't you touch me.<br> What about Jones?<br> There's no trace yet, sir.<br> Jones is dead.<br> I killed him.<br> He was of no use to us.<br> This girl, however, has certain<br> value where we're headed.<br> She'll bring a very good price.<br> Mmm?<br> Herr Colonel,<br> that cargo you've taken...<br> if it's your goal,<br> go in peace with it,<br> but leave us the girl.<br> It would reduce our loss<br> on this trip.<br> Savage!<br> You are not in the position<br> to ask for anything.<br> We will take what we wish.<br> And then decide whether or not<br> to blow your ship<br> from the water.<br> The girl goes with me.<br> She'll be part<br> of my compensation.<br> I'm sure your fuehrer<br> would approve.<br> If she fails to please me,<br> you may do with her as you wish.<br> I will waste<br> no more time with her now.<br> Excuse me.<br> I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.<br> I've looked everywhere.<br> He's got to be here somewhere.<br> Look again.<br> - I found him.<br> - Where?<br> There.<br> The altar has been<br> prepared in accordance<br> with your radio instructions,<br> sir.<br> Good.<br> Take the Ark there immediately.<br> Monsieur...<br> I am uncomfortable<br> with the thought<br> of this... Jewish ritual.<br> Are you sure it's necessary?<br> Let me ask you this:<br> Would you be more comfortable<br> opening the Ark in Berlin,<br> for your fuehrer?<br> Finding out, only then,<br> if the sacred pieces<br> of the Covenant are inside?<br> Knowing, only then,<br> whether you have accomplished<br> your mission,<br> and obtained the one true Ark?<br> Hello!<br> Jones.<br> Jones!<br> I'm going to blow up the Ark,<br> Rene.<br> Your persistence<br> surprises even me.<br> You're going to give<br> mercenaries a bad name.<br> Dr. Jones...<br> surely you don't think you can<br> escape from this island.<br> That depends on how reasonable<br> we're all willing to be.<br> All I want is the girl.<br> If we refuse?<br> Then your fuehrer has no prize.<br> Okay, stand back.<br> All of you, stand back.<br> Stand back.<br> Okay, Jones.<br> You win!<br> Blow it up.<br> Yes, blow it up!<br> Blow it back to God.<br> All your life has been spent<br> in pursuit<br> of archaeological relics.<br> Inside the Ark are treasures<br> beyond your wildest aspirations.<br> You want to see it open<br> as well as I.<br> Indiana...<br> we are simply passing<br> through history.<br> This...<br> This is history.<br> Do as you will.<br> Marion, don't look at it.<br> Shut your eyes, Marion.<br> Don't look at it,<br> no matter what happens.<br> Ah...<br> It's beautiful!<br> Indy?<br> Don't look, Marion!<br> Keep your eyes shut!<br> Marion.<br> You've done your country a<br> great service, and we thank you<br> and we trust you found<br> the settlement satisfactory.<br> Oh, the money's fine.<br> The situation's<br> totally unacceptable.<br> Well, gentlemen,<br> I guess that just about<br> wraps it up.<br> Where is the Ark?<br> I thought we'd settled that.<br> The Ark is somewhere very safe.<br> From whom?<br> The Ark is a source<br> of unspeakable power<br> and it has to be researched.<br> And it will be,<br> I assure you, Dr. Brody,<br> Dr. Jones.<br> We have top men<br> working on it right now.<br> Who?<br> Top men.<br> Hey, what happened?<br> You don't look very happy.<br> Fools. Bureaucratic fools.<br> What'd they say?<br> They don't know<br> what they've got there.<br> Well, I know what I've got here.<br> Come on.<br> I'll buy you a drink.<br> You know...<br> a drink?<br>
