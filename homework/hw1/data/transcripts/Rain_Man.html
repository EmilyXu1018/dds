I'm sorry.<br> I don't know an easy way<br> to say this, Mr. Babbitt--<br> Have I lost already?<br> No, you haven't lost.<br> I'm not the judge and jury.<br> I'm just making<br> a recommendation to a court.<br> I must tell you that Dr. Bruner<br> is a very respected professional.<br> Raymond's case has been meticulously<br> documented over the years...<br> and Wallbrook is one of the<br> finest institutions in this country.<br> You've made up your mind.<br> I'll see you in court.<br> My brother came further with me<br> than he did with you in 20 years.<br> - It's not necessary to--<br> - You don't know anything about us.<br> - It's not necessary to challenge him.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Exactly what happened<br> this past week, Raymond?<br> - We got to know each other.<br> - I was asking Raymond.<br> Raymond, what happened<br> this past week?<br> - What did you do?<br> - Counted cards.<br> - Counted cards?<br> - Counted cards in Las Vegas.<br> - Your brother took you to Las Vegas?<br> - Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.<br> Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?<br> Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.<br> - And what else did you do?<br> - Bet on number 20.<br> - What else did you do?<br> - Danced with Charlie Babbitt.<br> - Danced with your brother?<br> - He wanted to learn.<br> Danced in the elevator with Susanna.<br> Kissed Susanna.<br> - You kissed Susanna?<br> - Yeah, in the elevator.<br> - Did you enjoy kissing a woman?<br> - I don't know.<br> - How did it feel?<br> - It felt wet.<br> - Wet?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Quite a trip, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Did you enjoy being on the road?<br> - I'm an excellent driver.<br> - You drove?<br> - Yeah.<br> -Your brother let you drive the highway?<br> -Slow on the driveway.<br> He didn't drive on the highway.<br> - Did he have any emotional outbursts?<br> - What do you mean?<br> Well, things they tend to do when--<br> Inflict bodily harm on themselves.<br> - Yeah, a couple of times.<br> - A couple of times?<br> He had what you call an outburst at<br> the airport because he didn't wanna fly.<br> - So we didn't fly.<br> - When was his last outburst?<br> - This morning when--<br> - This morning?<br> This is bullshit, because I could<br> tell you anything or tell you nothing.<br> You'd never know the difference.<br> This morning the smoke alarm went off.<br> He got nervous,<br> but he's fine now.<br> Don't feel as I'm<br> placing any blame.<br> We went out for pancakes.<br> He's fine.<br> - You don't have to be defensive.<br> - I'm just being honest with you.<br> - You're missing the point.<br> - I'm being truthful about this.<br> I'm not placing any blame--<br> I had a father I hardly knew,<br> a mother I didn't know at all.<br> I find out now that I have a brother,<br> and I'm supposed to give him up?<br> No one is saying anything.<br> I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,<br> we're not hurting you.<br> - Why are you interfering?<br> - I'm not interfering.<br> - This is my family.<br> - I understand that.<br> Your brother is not capable<br> of having a relationship with you.<br> That's your opinion. Did you spend 24<br> hours a day, seven days a week with him?<br> You cannot care for your brother<br> without professional guidance.<br> - That's your opinion.<br> - Yes, it's my opinion.<br> There's some things<br> I'd Like to go over.<br> Dr. Bruner states a week ago you<br> stole Raymond out of the institution...<br> and were willing to trade him<br> for $1.5 million, correct?<br> My father died.<br> I was upset.<br> That was wrong.<br> Last week you were upset, and this week<br> you've found a devotion to him...<br> and you want to<br> take care of him.<br> Yes.<br> From the beginning<br> it was Like a kidnapping.<br> Kidnapping.
