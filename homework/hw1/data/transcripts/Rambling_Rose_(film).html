                        In deep Dixieland, the month<br> of October is almost summery.<br> I had come to visit my father.<br> Mother had died a few years before<br> and Daddy was living alone.<br> He wouldn't have it otherwise.<br> Seeing the old house,<br> nostalgia for the south gripped me.<br> The old South I had known<br> and the people in it.<br> When I was 13,<br> a girl came to this house.<br> I overheard my father<br> decide with my mother<br> to hire this girl.<br> A good-natured, but unfortunate girl,<br> working for a farm family,<br> near Gadsden, Alabama.<br> Thus she was hired,<br> sight unseen, by a long-distance call.<br> She was the first person<br> I ever loved outside my own family.<br> But, as my father said,<br> she caused<br> one hell of a damnable commotion.<br> Hello.<br> I'm Rose.<br> I've come to live with you.<br> Mother, the new girl's here.<br> Wonderful.<br> What's your impression of her?<br> She's big.<br> She could beat up Daddy if she wanted.<br> But she's very girlish.<br> She wouldn't hurt anybody.<br> Your impression is very reassuring.<br> I sensed that she was so.<br> I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.<br> You mean confirmed, mother.<br> If it had been confirmed previously,<br> it would be reconfirmed.<br> Alright.<br> You get Doll and Waski.<br> I'll telephone Daddy.<br> This is Waski. His real name<br> is Warren, but we call him Waski.<br> He dislikes it. I guess, one day<br> we'll have to stop calling him that.<br> You can stop it now.<br> You'll find him a very good boy.<br> As you can see, he's beautiful.<br> Rose,<br> this little girl is Frances.<br> We call her Dolly.<br> It's short for Doll or Doll Baby.<br> Doll Baby, that's worse than Waski.<br> I want to be called Fran.<br> Daddy won't allow it.<br> That young man, you have met.<br> He is my oldest son<br> and my most brilliant child.<br> They say<br> I brag too much about my children.<br> I simply tell the truth.<br> Am I boring you, Rose?<br> No, ma'am. Not at all.<br> Good.<br> I realised the remarkable thing<br> about Brother when he was 6 weeks old.<br> He looked at me and recognised me.<br> He understood me.<br> Sounds crazy, but it's the truth.<br> I have to warn you about him.<br> He can be very dangerous.<br> He has an evil streak in him.<br> It is a streak<br> of pure, sheer meanness.<br> You'll scare the girl, going into<br> the 4th dimension like that.<br> Maybe to you it's the 4th dimension,<br> but to me, it's the truth.<br> Well, well,<br> so Miss Rosebud has arrived.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Doll Baby, take this for me.<br> Rosebud...<br> I swear to God, you are<br> as graceful as a capital letter "S".<br> You will adorn our house<br> and give a glow to its old walls.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Now, it is my wife's belief,<br> which I accept, though do not grasp,<br> that to hire a person to do<br> household work is a criminal practice.<br> You are therefore here as a friend,<br> and indeed as a member of this family.<br> In love and harmony, dear Rosebud.<br> In love and harmony.<br> Do you understand?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I know you've had some troubles.<br> Those scoundrels in Birmingham<br> trying to lead you astray, and so on.<br> Life can be<br> very cruel to a young girl.<br> You've had a hard time.<br> But I hope and believe you've found<br> a safe haven in this house.<br> We welcome you to our home.<br> We welcome you from the heart.<br> We hope you're happy here.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Hands in your pocket,<br> pockets in your pants,<br> watch the turtles<br> so the hootchie-kootchie dance.<br> Let's see if she goes in the water.<br> Waski, you gotta lick your lips.<br> You mean to those seeds,<br> they'll snap at you, Waski.<br> Buddy,<br> that hotel that Mr. Hillyer runs...<br> do y'all own it personally?<br> Yes, it's part of Mother's estate.<br> Her estate?<br> Her inheritance. It was left to her<br> when she was orphaned.<br> Buddy, your mama was a orphan?<br> Yes.<br> Y'all help me shuck.<br> Hey, Buddy?<br> Where is Columbia University?<br> And what is it exactly?<br> It's an advanced school<br> for brilliant people, in New York.<br> New York?<br> New York! Imagine that,<br> with all them skyscrapers, and...<br> ...things like that. New York.<br> And your mama lived there?<br> Went to that school. Good Lord.<br> That's something.<br> Rose? Who were<br> those scoundrels in Birmingham?<br> Nobody. Keep shucking.<br> But who were they?<br> Bad men, that's all.<br> Bad in what sense?<br> Bad is bad, Buddy.<br> Ain't no sense to it.<br> Did they try<br> to make you become a prostitute?<br> I don't listen to talk like that.<br> I turn my back and look the other way.<br> That's why Daddy hired you, isn't it?<br> T o keep you away<br> from those scoundrels.<br> Your daddy is the best and<br> most kind-hearted man in the world.<br> Did you hear about<br> the terrible thing in Cave Spring?<br> What terrible thing?<br> There was this old man<br> that ate his niece.<br> I did not hear that. I don't hear you.<br> Chopped her into pork-chops.<br> - I don't even hear that.<br> There's terrible things in this world.<br> Rose, did you hear<br> about that man in Chattanooga?<br> Killed his wife with a black widow<br> spider. She suffered horribly.<br> You are in one of your evil moods.<br> That's what it is.<br> The family's all here.<br> Reverse-insomnia.<br> What a curse.<br> No appetite, either.<br> Rose, may I have half a cup of coffee?<br> - I already got it.<br> Rosebud baby...<br> you are the light of my life, darling.<br> You're as pretty as a moonbeam,<br> and warm as sunshine.<br> Now, how did we get by without you?<br> Rose must be<br> "non compos mentis" this morning.<br> Must be that time of the month.<br> She has been a little peaky lately.<br> - Not till Daddy came.<br> What, dear?<br> Your hearing aid is on the blink.<br> - What?<br> Your hearing aid<br> is buzzing at me like a snake.<br> Waski, I shot you. Fall down.<br> - I'm going.<br> Hey, Doll, come on.<br> I got you, too, Doll.<br> Mrs. Hillyer?<br> Yes, dear?<br> Will you get<br> your Master's degree soon?<br> Pretty soon, dear.<br> When I finish my thesis.<br> What are you studying right now?<br> - American history, dear.<br> Is that the story of this country?<br> Just like the story of a person?<br> Exactly.<br> You must have a wonderful brain!<br> Rose, darling, you work too hard.<br> Sit down and have a nice refreshment.<br> After all you and him has been doing<br> for me, working hard is nothing.<br> Mrs. Hillyer?<br> - Yes?<br> Is it true you were a orphan?<br> Yes.<br> After the age of seven, I was.<br> Me, too.<br> Daddy sure is dumb.<br> Mother didn't notice, either.<br> You'd think she wouldnotice.<br> - She is ignorant about such things.<br> Besides,<br> her maternal feelings are aroused.<br> Maternal feelings run deep.<br> Yeah.<br> Rose is in terrible shape.<br> - Yeah, she is.<br> Shut up, Wawa. You don't even<br> know what we're talking about.<br> I do, too.<br> Rose is madly in love with Daddy.<br> He loves me. He loves me not.<br> You don't eats greens?<br> Alright.<br> Here, Rose.<br> T ake my napkin, darlin'. It's OK.<br> Are you alright? Are you ill?<br> No, ma'am, I'm just fine.<br> I just spilt the beans.<br> I have to present my magazine<br> at the garden club tonight.<br> I'll drive you. You have no business<br> at the wheel of an automobile.<br> Why not? If you're not thinking,<br> you'll run into a telephone pole.<br> Darling, I think about what I'm doing,<br> all the time.<br> And I have as much right to be<br> at the wheel of a car as anybody.<br> Besides, I want you<br> to help Rose with the dishes.<br> She isn't feeling well.<br> - The dishes, darling?<br> Yes.<br> You can help, even though<br> it's not a man-type thing to do.<br> Man-type things, women-type things.<br> The creative force behind the universe<br> doesn't care about such things.<br> So you can help with the dishes?<br> Certainly, darling. Delighted.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> Come on.<br> I'll be damned.<br> It says the moon is 238,000 miles<br> from the Earth. How about that?<br> Mister Moon.<br> It says that it's a solid rock body,<br> two thousand miles in diameter.<br> That's fascinating.<br> I think she's going to kiss him.<br> - At least.<br> Oh, God, Mr. Hillyer!<br> I love you! I tried!<br> But I can't help it. Kiss me!<br> Rose, Rose, Rose!<br> Get off my lap.<br> Buddy, stop it. I can't see!<br> I can't help it. - Calm down.<br> The children will hear you.<br> No, no. Let's talk about this thing.<br> Please.<br> - No, let's calm down and discuss it.<br> Please. Don't make me get up.<br> What are they doing?<br> - Discussing it.<br> I can't kiss you.<br> I only kiss Mrs. Hillyer.<br> But I love you.<br> - You don't love me. - I do.<br> Just kiss me once. - If I did,<br> you wouldn't ask anymore?<br> Just once.<br> - On the lips or mouth? - Mouth.<br> I only kiss Mrs. Hillyer on the mouth.<br> They're kissing.<br> What's happening now?<br> Rose's titty is out.<br> His hand is on it.<br> Enough of this damn nonsense.<br> And I mean enough.<br> Get up, Rose.<br> Put your damn tit back in your dress.<br> You hear me?<br> Replace that tit.<br> Damn you, girl.<br> You made me make a fool out of myself.<br> She put it away.<br> A man is supposed to be a fool.<br> But a woman should have some control.<br> Now, are you a nitwit?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer.<br> I couldn't help it 'cause I love you.<br> Rose, Rose,<br> poor miserable child...<br> You said you loved Mrs. Hillyer.<br> Is this any way to repay her?<br> She would defend you.<br> She would fight for you like a tiger.<br> Don't cry, honey.<br> Don't cry. Here...<br> Now let me warn you...<br> I'm standing here at Thermopylae.<br> I am standing at Thermopylae...<br> ...and the Persians shall not pass.<br> Now get your tail out of here,<br> and wash those dishes. Go on!<br> Wasn't Daddy great?<br> I bet he wanted to kiss her some more,<br> but he didn't.<br> He was probably just scared Mother<br> would come home early and catch him.<br> Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.<br> Ooh, Baby Doll...<br> Thermopylae...<br> ...The Persians shall not pass.<br> Buddy, are you asleep?<br> No, I'm awake.<br> What's wrong?<br> Buddy, I have been wandering<br> in the wilderness, lost.<br> I feel awful. Do you mind<br> if I get in bed with you for a while?<br> Alright.<br> I'll be quiet.<br> I'll lie here a while.<br> You go on back to sleep.<br> Oh, Buddy, you don't know<br> how it hurts to have a broken heart.<br> Men, I don't understand 'em.<br> I can't see through them.<br> I can't figure them out.<br> They break my heart, that's all.<br> But this is the worst ever.<br> 'Cause<br> it wasn't his fault, it was mine.<br> I was bad.<br> You wouldn't believe how bad I was.<br> What did you do, Rose?<br> I was just awful, Buddy.<br> Worse than you could know,<br> a child like you.<br> It isn't just the loss of him...<br> ...but my own bad behavior<br> what bothers me so.<br> It has just made me ill. I am sick.<br> What was the cause of it all?<br> You promise<br> not to tell Doll or nobody?<br> It's your Daddy. I'm so much in love<br> with him, I'm out of my mind.<br> How could such a thing happen?<br> You know, when I first come,<br> and he says I looked graceful<br> like the letter "S",<br> and called me "Rosebud"?<br> I fell madly in love<br> with him right there, right then.<br> But it's a lost love.<br> He's a good man.<br> He won't have nothing to do with me.<br> Can I touch you here?<br> It's soft.<br> It's awful soft.<br> - What did you expect?<br> I thought it was like a cantaloupe.<br> - That's some idea, a cantaloupe.<br> There's some gristle in it.<br> - Buddy, quit that.<br> You're just a child. You shouldn't be<br> interested about such things.<br> Actually, I am.<br> That daddy of yours<br> is the funniest man.<br> The things he says.<br> You never know what he'll say next.<br> Can I<br> put my hand inside your nightgown?<br> No, you can't. I'll tell you<br> something else. He scares me.<br> You can't fool around with him.<br> Not with that man.<br> If I ever do that again,<br> he'll fire me.<br> Can I see what nipple looks like?<br> Buddy, what has come over you?<br> A child like you, asking such things.<br> I'm curious, Rose.<br> Buddy, get your hand away. Quit it!<br> Get your hand off of me, Buddy!<br> Buddy, come on.<br> - Just for a second. What's the harm?<br> You don't realize it,<br> but what you're doing isn't nice.<br> Can't I just see<br> what the nipple looks like?<br> Are you satisfied now?<br> Can we lie and talk now, huh?<br> It has a nipple.<br> - Or course.<br> At first<br> I couldn't feel it, but now I do.<br> It's like an acorn.<br> - OK, Buddy, that's enough.<br> You're just a child, and wouldn't<br> understand, but that type of thing...<br> ...can stir a girl up.<br> Now you lie down and we'll just talk.<br> It was softer than I thought.<br> That was my main impression.<br> If you hit a girl there,<br> it could hurt her a lot.<br> Who would do a thing such as that?<br> Some fiend might.<br> You know, Buddy,<br> I can't figure you out at all.<br> You can be very nice, but like your<br> mama said, you have an evil streak.<br> Everyone does, Rose.<br> Your Daddy doesn't.<br> What has happened<br> has made me love your pa more.<br> I not only love him,<br> I respect him.<br> I admire him.<br> I have a serious favor to ask.<br> - Most men would act like he did.<br> If they get a girl, they go ahead<br> and get her. Just like some monkey.<br> Then they tell her she's no good,<br> when they done the same thing.<br> Since you're here in bed with me, and<br> I've already touched your titty...<br> Buddy, what an awful thing to say!<br> Where did you get<br> any such idea as that, anyhow?<br> I'm curious, Rose.<br> I'm real curious.<br> Well that is just too bad.<br> Curiosity killed the cat.<br> Yeah, but satisfaction<br> brought him back. May I?<br> No. You should be ashamed, asking<br> such a nasty thing, a child your age.<br> Can't I touch it just a little bit?<br> Just to see what it's like?<br> No.<br> Oh, Rose, I'm curious.<br> Can't I touch it for a second?<br> Aren't you my friend?<br> Don't you like me?<br> I like you a lot.<br> In fact, I love you.<br> You're sweet, Buddy,<br> but you don't really love me. - I do!<br> Don't you like me just a little bit?<br> Sure I like you, Buddy.<br> But you're just a child.<br> I'm 13 and I have a natural curiosity.<br> It's nature, Rose.<br> Now what's wrong with nature?<br> Honey, what's the matter?<br> Just that...<br> ...damnable reverse-insomnia.<br> You go back to sleep.<br> The Depression has got me.<br> Strong men weeping, children hungry.<br> What a life, what a world.<br> Buddy, quit it.<br> Am I hurting you?<br> No, you're not hurting me.<br> You just better quit it, that's all.<br> - Why, if I'm not hurting you?<br> You wouldn't understand.<br> I must be out of my mind.<br> This is definitely the most<br> fascinating experience of my life.<br> Oh, Lord.<br> Man rises like sparks in a fire.<br> What's wrong, Rose?<br> Are you sick?<br> I have robbed a cradle<br> and fell into hell.<br> I must be crazy!<br> I got to get out of here!<br> Buddy,<br> you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?<br> No, I won't tell a soul.<br> I sure hope you don't.<br> I got to get out of here.<br> I hate to turn this light on.<br> Your daddy is downstairs.<br> I have to take the chance.<br> Buddy, please don't tell on me.<br> I said I wouldn't.<br> - Buddy, I never meant to harm you.<br> I'd never hurt you, ever.<br> But they'd think I did.<br> I don't see why you're so worried.<br> It was my idea. - You don't get it.<br> They'd blame me, not you.<br> They'd think I was awful.<br> A disgusting girl, which I am.<br> But please don't tell! Please!<br> Rose, what did those scoundrels<br> in Birmingham want with you?<br> They wanted what you said.<br> - For you to be a prostitute?<br> How much do they pay girls to do it?<br> In the house in Birmingham, 3 dollars.<br> The girls got a dollar<br> and the house took two.<br> How many men did they have to<br> do it with in a day? - I don't know.<br> Twelve, that's a lot of men.<br> They probably had BO.<br> and needed shaves.<br> Probably.<br> On the other hand,<br> In two days, you'd make<br> what you make here in a month.<br> Buddy, I don't want to be no whore.<br> I can't. It'd kill me.<br> But that isn't why<br> I don't want you to tell them.<br> The reason is...<br> ...I love it here.<br> I love your whole family.<br> And Buddy...<br> I don't want to have to go.<br> So please...<br> ...if you like me a little bit...<br> ...don't tell them, please!<br> I know that I'm a bad girl.<br> But please have pity on me. Please.<br> Buddy, don't tell them. Please don't.<br> I won't tell on you, Rose.<br> They could<br> put splinters under my fingernails...<br> ...and I would never tell.<br> Because I love you, Rose.<br> Thank you, Buddy.<br> When I start bothering your Daddy,<br> even worse, robbing a cradle,<br> I gotta face the facts of life.<br> T omorrow...<br> I'm going to get myself up and go out.<br> Get yourself up and go out?<br> Buddy,<br> Mr. Right is out there somewheres,<br> and I'm going to find him.<br> If I have to wake you up<br> at 11:00 in the morning,<br> either you're sick,<br> or you were up very late last night.<br> You weren't reading<br> "Huckleberry Finn".<br> I looked in your room.<br> It's not there.<br> What were you doing?<br> I have to tell the truth.<br> - Of course.<br> I was reading one of those<br> dirty comic books. - Oh, Brother!<br> I'm so disappointed in you.<br> You mustn't read them.<br> They degrade the human image.<br> They're filthy.<br> - Sex isn't ugly.<br> It's very beautiful. The creative<br> power of the universe designed it.<br> I know. We must respect it.<br> We must be in awe of it.<br> Oh, I am in awe of it.<br> - Not enough. Get the castor oil.<br> Can't it be Calomel? - This is not<br> punishment. It's for your health.<br> If you act like this,<br> you are full of poisons, you are sick.<br> Here, Buddy.<br> Here we go. Open up.<br> One, two, open up.<br> Good.<br> Goddamn crap.<br> What'd you say?<br> I said "putrid stuff. "<br> - No, you didn't, Brother.<br> I did. Your hearing aid isn't working.<br> He's lying.<br> - Doll, I'll cut your guts out.<br> And yesterday he stole money out...<br> - Shut up, you brat!<br> Children, be quiet.<br> The strangest<br> vibrations are in this house today.<br> Where is Rose, anyway?<br> Getting herself up to go out.<br> - What did you say?<br> She's getting herself up to go out.<br> - Out? Oh, yes, it's Thursday.<br> Oh! Hello, Rose, dear.<br> My, you're looking..<br> ...pretty. - Like my outfit?<br> I made most of it myself.<br> Well...<br> It's very... cheerful.<br> I have a knack for designing clothes.<br> For the day...<br> isn't it... tight?<br> - It's meant to be clinging.<br> Holy catfish!<br> What have you done to yourself?<br> I got myself up is all.<br> - Got yourself up?<br> I'm going out. - You're going<br> out in public like in those clothes?<br> Darling, I wish<br> you wouldn't pick on Rose.<br> Ignore him. You look very pretty.<br> - You're sweet.<br> Come on, Waski, stop it.<br> - No.<br> Daddy, Buddy was up late<br> reading dirty comic books.<br> Mother gave him castor oil,<br> and he cursed it, and took<br> the Lord's name in vain,<br> then he claimed he hadn't said it.<br> Don't be a tattletale. You mustn't be<br> Delilahish with your brother.<br> I'm only trying to help him.<br> - What a hypocrite.<br> You must talk to him. He was<br> reading those ghastly books again.<br> Lay off that stuff, son.<br> It upsets your mother.<br> I mean seriously speak with him.<br> He shouldn't<br> read those depraved things.<br> OK.<br> I'll take him with me downtown.<br> You, too, Rose, if you want a ride.<br> I'd love one.<br> I'm going out amongst 'em, boys.<br> Gumballs...<br> Gumballs!<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> My feet sure do hurt.<br> I bet they don't hurt as much as mine.<br> Why do yours hurt?<br> - I'm a salesman. Do a lot of walking.<br> Incredible, the swiftness of it.<br> The girl strikes like a cobra.<br> That girl bothers me.<br> She bothers you?<br> In what way, dear?<br> It is a little tedious<br> having her around.<br> You think Rose is tedious?<br> I don't think she's tedious.<br> I think<br> she's the very opposite of tedious.<br> From a man's standpoint,<br> she's tedious.<br> She's back.<br> And in one piece, I hope.<br> I thought you liked Rose.<br> - I'm crazy about Rose.<br> I just hope she<br> isn't a hotcha character, that's all.<br> Hotcha character?<br> What you don't understand is,<br> it's positive energy on this planet.<br> It's what we do with it<br> that makes it negative.<br> Darling, don't go off<br> into the 4th dimension, all right?<br> Every time...<br> Every time I say something important,<br> you always say<br> I've gone off into the 4th dimension.<br> Well I don't entirely grasp<br> your philosophy, but I respect it.<br> I respect it.<br> Then I wish you wouldn't<br> say cynical and mean things,<br> that go against life itself.<br> What's so cynical about hoping<br> Rose isn't a hotcha character?<br> She just wants<br> to look pretty, that's all.<br> We are not going to argue about this.<br> I can see that you are beyond reason.<br> So are you, dear.<br> So are you.<br> I don't want to talk to you.<br> I'm not going to talk with you.<br> I can't hear you.<br> Sweetheart, your hearing aid<br> is buzzing. I didn't hear you.<br> I said be quiet.<br> I don't want to talk to you anymore.<br> I have nothing to say.<br> It's obvious you don't love me,<br> or even respect me.<br> I love and adore you, sweetheart.<br> You know that.<br> Do you?<br> You know I do.<br> I just hope that Rose's bite<br> isn't as bad as her bark.<br> It's not.<br> You just don't understand her.<br> It isn't sex she wants. It's love.<br> Those silly clothes she wears<br> is the only way she knows to get it.<br> You may be right, but I'm afraid we'll<br> rue the day Rosebud came to our house.<br> I disagree with you.<br> She's a very sweet girl.<br> And she loves children.<br> She loves everybody,<br> that's her problem.<br> Everybody.<br> - That's not a bad quality.<br> No, it's a beautiful quality.<br> You're right as rain, sweetheart.<br> You sleepy?<br> - No.<br> You sleepy?<br> Can you hear me?<br> - I don't need to, I can feel you.<br> Rose!<br> The scruffy man is back in the garden.<br> - Well, I don't know him.<br> I'm going to call Daddy.<br> Have a good stay.<br> Grand Hotel.<br> The scruffy looking man is back.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Where is he?<br> - Over there.<br> Come here! Come back here, you!<br> Come back here!<br> I couldn't catch him.<br> He ran like a deer.<br> I don't know him.<br> Doll, I got St. Louis<br> on my crystal radio.<br> I don't care about your radio.<br> I'm worried about Rose.<br> She's awful dumb.<br> - She's not dumb, Doll Baby.<br> Her basic intelligence<br> is probably above average.<br> Then why does she act so dumb?<br> Daddy petrifies her so intensely,<br> her brain blows a fuse.<br> And she doesn't like to think anyhow.<br> Son-of-bitch! What're you doing here?<br> Knock me out!<br> Knock me out right here!<br> I got a loaded shotgun,<br> so you better get outta here quick!<br> And don't come back.<br> I'll blow your heads off!<br> You children go to bed.<br> Very good, Rose.<br> Waski would like some.<br> Give her your juice glass.<br> Waski, pass the syrup to your brother.<br> Doll, do you want some?<br> Well, Rose..<br> my sleep was disturbed last night.<br> So was Mrs. Hillyer's<br> and the children's. How about you?<br> Was your sleep disturbed, too?<br> Why, yes, it was.<br> I heard strange voices.<br> Strange voices, Rose?<br> Rose,<br> stop behaving as if you were Bo-Peep.<br> I'm not behaving<br> as if I'm Bo-Peep, sir.<br> Those men had a fight<br> because of some female in this house,<br> and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.<br> Well, it's because...<br> I don't know them.<br> They're strangers to me.<br> Darling?<br> I don't think Rose is well.<br> She may have a fever.<br> It's not my fault<br> if the girl has the Epizootics.<br> Rose, when I have to<br> get up at night to defend my home,<br> against 2 scoundrels in the bushes...<br> They weren't scoundrels.<br> They were just boys.<br> Boyfriends of Rose's<br> And why shouldn't she have boyfriends?<br> Don't you think she's human,<br> the same as you are yourself?<br> Just a moment, dear.<br> All I meant is, I wouldn't want<br> any young woman living in my house,<br> traipsing out at night,<br> meeting strange orangutans<br> to discuss the New Deal with 'em.<br> I'm not going to listen to this.<br> We're having a conversation,<br> and you bring in orangutans?<br> Darling, please.<br> Scrappers in the bushes, whatever.<br> It's the South with its<br> horrible traditions of slavery<br> and oppression of women.<br> The South has<br> nothing to do with this. Now, Rose...<br> You cannot fire this girl.<br> Not for having boyfriends.<br> Not while I<br> have strength in my finger,<br> to squeeze the trigger, and shoot you<br> with the truth between the eyes.<br> I don't intend to fire her.<br> You don't'?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Rose, I told you she's your friend,<br> and would fight for you like a tiger?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thanks to her, you get another chance.<br> But don't try my patience again.<br> There are growing children here.<br> You understand?<br> Yes, sir, I do.<br> I'm gonna tell Foster<br> and Horton to stay away from here.<br> I'm playing<br> a spectacular triple-combination.<br> Nine ball in the corner.<br> Read 'em and weep, boy.<br> That's all she wrote.<br> Mr. Hillyer,<br> the police Chief is on the telephone.<br> What exactly happened?<br> There was a brawl<br> at the "Busy Beaver" last night.<br> The fur was flying, the gal<br> was screeching. All hell broke loose.<br> You know Horton, the bootlegger?<br> - I've heard of the scoundrel.<br> Scoundrel is right. He near<br> killed a man with a beer bottle.<br> This girl was the cause of it all.<br> She bit a police officer's thumb<br> down to the bone.<br> She was real upset.<br> She didn't mean to bite me.<br> No, I didn't mean to bite him.<br> I got an awful bad cold.<br> I believe she mite be sick.<br> - She's as healthy as a horse.<br> No, I'm not, Mr. Hillyer.<br> I'm as sick as a dog.<br> You wouldn't want her<br> to have an arrest record.<br> She's your girl, Mr. Hillyer.<br> You want me to release her to you?<br> - No, not really.<br> But I guess we'll have to do that.<br> Le t the crazy creature out<br> and I'll take her home.<br> I didn't mean to bite him.<br> He was hitting Horton real mean,<br> and I just bit him accidental.<br> I have to get back to the hotel.<br> I'll speak to you later, Rose.<br> What is Rose going to do?<br> Where can she go?<br> I don't know. They're still in there.<br> I gotta find out what's going on.<br> Daddy will kill you, Buddy!<br> Who says that our morals<br> are any better than hers?<br> The idea that one set of morals<br> is as good as another is ridiculous.<br> Ridiculous!<br> Maybe so, but Rose has never hurt<br> anybody, and she never would.<br> She bit<br> a policeman's thumb to the bone!<br> I'm sure that in her heart,<br> her intentions were good.<br> Good intentions are what<br> the road to hell is paved with.<br> You can have a good heart<br> and still do a lot of harm.<br> Excuse me.<br> I could have sworn I saw that boy.<br> Rascal.<br> I just don't understand how<br> Rose could be a bad influence.<br> She has a loving nature.<br> You should want<br> someone like that around the children.<br> Why do you think all men like her?<br> - I've got a pretty good idea.<br> You mean sex?<br> You couldn't be more wrong.<br> Anybody with common sense can be<br> sexy. Rose likes those boys and men.<br> She has love in her heart.<br> That's why they follow her.<br> Sweetheart,<br> I'm sorry, but Rose has to go.<br> Well, let me talk to her.<br> What's happening?<br> Mother fought like a tiger, but...<br> - Is Rose going to have to leave?<br> She might.<br> - I don't think it's fair!<br> What did Rose do?<br> - She bit a policeman's thumb.<br> She shouldn't have bitten anyone,<br> but I don't see why she has to leave.<br> She didn't do anything really bad.<br> Dear, are you alright?<br> Rose, you're ill.<br> You're burning up!<br> I don't need to go to the hospital.<br> I'll die if I go to the hospital!<br> No you won't. You listen.<br> I promise you're not going to.<br> We're coming right behind you.<br> It's a safe place.<br> The hospital is huge.<br> We're going to say a prayer for Rose.<br> It's going to be alright.<br> We better say a prayer for her.<br> She's in here.<br> The girl's as strong as an ox.<br> That is what's keeping her alive.<br> But not many people<br> walk away from double-pneumonia.<br> She looks terrible. She looks awful.<br> Of course. And I am puzzled<br> by your delay in bringing her here.<br> Her illness was grossly neglected,<br> I don't understand why this occurred.<br> We didn't know she was so sick.<br> I think normal powers of observation<br> night have suggested it to you.<br> Rose hid it from us.<br> She's afraid of the hospital.<br> Afraid of the hospital?<br> Deathly afraid. Her people are poor<br> farmers, she doesn't know medicine.<br> That girl is a product<br> of the hookworm and pellagra belt?<br> Yes. She's from a poor dirt farm.<br> I find that unbelievable.<br> Aside from her illness at the moment,<br> she is very strong.<br> and a splendid specimen<br> of a young human female.<br> And a comely one.<br> She has the figure of a Venus do Milo.<br> She definitely got protein as a child.<br> Rose is an amazing girl.<br> We took her to our dentist.<br> She had perfect teeth. No cavities!<br> Just so.<br> You don't get perfect teeth<br> eating sorghum syrup and hoecake.<br> She had protein. Which also accounts<br> for her superb aeriferous endowment.<br> Her what?<br> Lung capacity, sir.<br> That's why I believe she will survive,<br> despite delay in medical treatment.<br> That's all I want to know.<br> Thank you for your discourse, Doctor.<br> Very interesting, I'm sure.<br> Now let's get out of here<br> before I get the epizootics myself.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> I beg you pardon... "Epi-zoo-tics"?<br> You mean "Epi-zo-o-tics"?<br> An animal epidemic?<br> No, I mean epi-zoo-tics.<br> T elling me about epizootics!<br> They oughtta hang that polecat!<br> You don't like him because<br> he's a Yankee. - He's a polecat, dear.<br> Rosebud looked pitiful in that bed.<br> I hope she's alright.<br> But I still think we should fire her.<br> How can you think of that<br> at a time like this?<br> When she recovers, dear.<br> He's so smart and good inside.<br> And so unhappy with a rich wife not<br> understanding, her being a southerner.<br> You're too uncritical of people.<br> But you don't know<br> the bedside manner of that man.<br> He's so soothing, so smart,<br> and do kind-hearted deep inside.<br> He practically gets tears in his eyes,<br> listening to my heartbeat.<br> He says to me, "My dear,<br> you are beautiful. "<br> Wasn't that a nice thing<br> for a doctor to say to a patient?<br> What could cheer a girl up more?<br> Rose, I have doubts about that doctor.<br> So does Daddy.<br> He has doubts about hisself.<br> Isn't that sad?<br> The poor man thinks nobody likes him.<br> I'd believe it.<br> - He wants justice in the world.<br> For everyone, especially the coloreds.<br> That's nice of him,<br> 'cause the coloreds have a rough life.<br> Yes, they do,<br> but that guy doesn't care.<br> Then why does he say it?<br> T o look better than everyone else.<br> Dr. Martinson!<br> Come in, please.<br> It's very damp outside.<br> Rose is feeling so much better.<br> In fact, she's almost all well.<br> Let me be the judge of that, Madam.<br> - Yes.<br> Her room is at the head of the stairs.<br> Right on the right.<br> When is that polecat<br> going to come down from her room?<br> Dr. Martinson is a very good doctor.<br> He studied at Johns Hopkins.<br> I don't care<br> if he studied at the North Pole<br> Anyway, I have a plan for Rose.<br> I'm gonna start with clothes.<br> She dresses too provocatively,<br> and we've talked about it.<br> Where are you going?<br> Everything all right, Doctor?<br> - Oh, yes... fine.<br> She's getting healthy.<br> A few more days.<br> Rose, you look so pretty.<br> You're sweet<br> to make this dress for me.<br> Darling,<br> now she is a different person.<br> Being sick made an impression on her.<br> I think she's learned her lesson.<br> Open this door, Rose!<br> Open it this instant!<br> Open it or I'll break it down!<br> - Who is it?<br> Open the door, damn you!<br> You got a man in there.<br> I saw his shoes on the back porch.<br> Rose,<br> open up immediately, You hear me?<br> Rose, procrastination won't help you!<br> Where is he?<br> - Nobody is here.<br> I knwo he's here. - There's nobody!<br> - Where are you, you bastard?<br> Where have you got him hid?<br> - There ain't nobody here.<br> And who, may I ask, is that?<br> Well...<br> That's Billy.<br> - And what was Billy doing here?<br> Billy's very poor, ain't got no money.<br> He had no place else to go.<br> Silly question.<br> He's nice. You'd like him.<br> He wants to be a fireman.<br> Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman.<br> Put something on, You're naked.<br> I think your friend Billy is injured.<br> Where are his clothes?<br> Under the mattress.<br> I didn't want to be mad.<br> He wants to marry me. He's sweet.<br> I can't marry him. He's got no money,<br> no job, he's too young and all...<br> ...but he loves me,<br> and I was thinking...<br> You won't hurt him?<br> Oh, I won't hurt him, Rose.<br> - Mr Hillyer, I know I was bad.<br> I hadn't ought to have done it.<br> But I am only a human girl person.<br> I ain't always perfect.<br> Don't fire me.<br> I love you all so much.<br> Rosebud, you break my heart.<br> But I am only a human man person,<br> ... of the father variety.<br> Pack your bag, baby.<br> As of this moment<br> you're hired, mired, and fired.<br> This country<br> couldn't stand George lll,<br> and I can't stand Rose!<br> But liberation is at hand.<br> Hear ye, hear ye, I've got news.<br> I called cousin Hop long distance,<br> and Rose,<br> I found you a job in Tennessee.<br> Tennessee?<br> - It's a lovely state.<br> What kind of job is it?<br> - You'll like it. It's an outdoor job.<br> You mean a farm? - No, not exactly.<br> It is a dairy establishment.<br> Honey, Rose<br> has terrible memories of farm life.<br> Rose, this isn't a dirt farm like<br> the one you were born on. It's nice.<br> Nieghbor of cousin Hop's.<br> It isn't a farm, damn it.<br> It's a beautiful dairy establishment.<br> Now stop crying, Rose.<br> It's ideal.<br> How can you call it ideal? You know<br> what the word "farm" means to her.<br> It isn't a farm. - Calling it a<br> dairy establishment is jiggery-pokery.<br> She's goin' there tomorrow.<br> And I must say, it is selfish<br> of her to sit there and cry.<br> I'm crying<br> for somebody else, not me.<br> Who?<br> I hate to think of the baby<br> being born on a farm.<br> What baby is that?<br> Mine. I'm going to have one.<br> Good God Almighty!<br> This is a calamity!<br> They won't hire her now, mama.<br> You poor thing.<br> Don't cry, honey. Nobody's perfect.<br> Who's the father, dear?<br> - Well...<br> I know this is embarrassing, but<br> who were you exposed to, dear?<br> Well, Mrs. Hillyer,<br> it's kind of hard to say...<br> This is no good line of questioning.<br> The problem is, what are we gonna do?<br> That's why I'm asking who he is.<br> It is the most vital question.<br> Who is he, dear?<br> She doesn't know.<br> - She must know, unless...<br> Unless... Rose!<br> Was there ore than one person?<br> It's kind of hard to think right now.<br> - You shouldn't act like that.<br> Oh, I know. But I didn't really.<br> There was only one, but<br> he's out of town and didn't<br> leave me no forwarding address.<br> No forwarding address?<br> No forwarding address? Hold the phone.<br> In the shock of this,<br> I forgot something.<br> Rose will lie.<br> She's no more pregnant than I am.<br> I am, too!<br> You are not!<br> - Yes I am!<br> Tell us, Rose.<br> Why do you think you're pregnant?<br> I hadn't had my period in 3 months<br> and my stomach is getting big.<br> I don't believe it.<br> - It's so, Mr. Hillyer.<br> All right.<br> You've had your clothes off enough.<br> Pull up your dress<br> and let's take a look.<br> Honey!<br> She can keep her panties on.<br> Pull up your dress, Rose.<br> You just won't believe me.<br> - Rose you don't have to.<br> I don't mind.<br> - Now you'll see she's lying.<br> See?<br> I'd say about three months.<br> Are you satisfied?<br> What did you say she had?<br> - An ovarian cyst.<br> What is that?<br> - We thought she was pregnant.<br> I'm not surprised you thought that.<br> An ovarian cyst<br> can look very much like pregnancy.<br> But that's just wishful thinking.<br> She's lost her reproductive capacity.<br> She had gonorrhea at age 15,<br> and it was left untreated.<br> Gonorrhea?<br> - Just so.<br> She also had tuberculosis.<br> The X-rays plainly show scarring.<br> But the Gonorrhea caused irreparable<br> damage to her fallopian tubes.<br> She can never have children.<br> That's very sad. Poor Rose.<br> What a sad life she's had.<br> Just so.<br> Now as to the malignancy...<br> I think it unlikely.<br> I probably shouldn't have told her.<br> You're right. She thinks<br> she has cancer and is going to die.<br> She is an adult, Mr. Hillyer.<br> I merely gave her the facts.<br> If she survives the surgery,<br> it's better than being pregnant.<br> No. It's a blessing, really.<br> And a stroke of luck<br> for an other reason.<br> This operation<br> provides a therapeutic opportunity,<br> important in the case of this girl,<br> who suffers not only from a cyst,<br> but also from a neurotic condition.<br> Neurotic condition?<br> Go ahead, Doctor.<br> I'm following you.<br> Evidently, she has been<br> quite promiscuous since childhood.<br> She has absolutely<br> no control over her sexual impulses.<br> Pray continue, Doctor.<br> As a rule, I don't<br> believe in radical hysterectomy.<br> The woman's hormonal system<br> can be profoundly disturbed.<br> She may become depressed,<br> and certain secondary sexual<br> characteristics can be affected.<br> Her breasts<br> may shrink and become flabby.<br> Facial hair may appear, along with<br> a certain coarsening of the features.<br> And of course, her sexual drive<br> would be greatly diminished.<br> For these reasons I am opposed<br> to removing the womb and other ovary.<br> As a rule. Do you follow me, sir?<br> I'm ahead of you.<br> I think we both know her.<br> Yes, we do.<br> I don't understand this bushy talk.<br> Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick,<br> in more ways than one.<br> She is an extreme psychoneurotic<br> with uncontrolled sexual impulses.<br> We can spare her the suffering<br> she causes herself...<br> ...and others.<br> Therefore, I recommend,<br> as a theraputic measure,<br> removing her second ovary.<br> I feel<br> it is the medically proper decision.<br> And I suspect that your husband<br> agrees with me.<br> Reluctantly, I do. It would be<br> a kindness to her, and everyone else.<br> But the girl is oversexed.<br> And I say,<br> spay her.<br> Over my dead body!<br> Are you human beings?<br> Or some kind of male monsters?<br> Is there no limit to what you'll do to<br> keep your illusions about yourselves?<br> Illusions?<br> You'd go so far<br> as to mutilate a helpless girl,<br> with no means of defending herself?<br> I know what you just said.<br> Do you think I don't understand<br> the dreadful, revolting crime<br> you just conspired to commit?<br> I thought I knew you better.<br> I thought... in your heart...<br> you were a good and kind man.<br> A defenseless girl, trusting you<br> to protect her,<br> and you propose to destroy her?<br> Well, now...<br> I thought it sounded reasonable.<br> I thought she might be better off.<br> If I thought that you meant it,<br> I wouldn't want to live.<br> You look me in the eye.<br> Could you really take Rose's womanhood<br> from her, when it's all she has got?<br> May I say,<br> that I am against this as a rule,<br> but in the case<br> of near-nymphomania...<br> I must admit,<br> in Rose's case it would be cruel.<br> She's so attractive and pretty...<br> But...<br> ...no... no.<br> It would be bad for any young woman,<br> whether it be Rose,<br> or our Doll Baby<br> growing up, or whoever.<br> I was wrong, and you're right.<br> And you are wrong.<br> I'm sorry, darling. Please forgive me.<br> I was dead wrong.<br> I will not cry like a woman.<br> Now you get this straight.<br> I don't have very much money any more,<br> but I can raise quite a few<br> thousand dollars if I have to.<br> And if you hurt that girl,<br> I'll hire lawyers,<br> and sue you from here to kingdom come.<br> I'll ruin you.<br> Just so.<br> Actually, I won't operate.<br> I don't do major surgery.<br> Dr. Hardy will operate,<br> and of course, he shall be<br> guided by your wishes, dear lady.<br> Let him be guided not by my wishes,<br> nor by Rose's wishes,<br> thought I'm sure they are identical.<br> Let him be guided<br> by the wishes<br> of the creative power of life itself,<br> because that is<br> what has spoken through me here today.<br> I thought I'd seen it all, but this is<br> the biggest epizootic she's ever had.<br> How is she?<br> - She's fine. Rose is fine.<br> You're looking chipper, Rose.<br> I feel perfect. Except for the scar,<br> I wouldn't know I was in the hospital.<br> Well, we know you been there.<br> We got the hospital bill<br> and it's pretty blood-curdling.<br> I'm going to pay you back.<br> - I didn't mean that. Forget about it.<br> I could take a job as a waitress.<br> Absolutely not, Rose.<br> You're not working<br> in any honky-tonk place. Just a touch.<br> Well, I have a hotel to run.<br> Bye, darling. - Have fun.<br> "Room and a bath<br> for a dollar and a half. "<br> I married a rich woman,<br> and now I'm running a jack-leg hotel.<br> Morning, ladies.<br> Buddy?<br> I'm going to have to leave here.<br> I have to go.<br> Why do you say that, Rose?<br> I got to, Buddy.<br> Why did you<br> get rid of all your rabbits?<br> I don't know.<br> I just got tired of them.<br> When I was a child,<br> we had more than 500 rabbits.<br> Five hundred rabbits?<br> At least.<br> We had them in orange crates.<br> Daddy thought we could sell them.<br> but only country folk eat rabbit.<br> And they ain't got mo money.<br> We had to eat them all our ownselves.<br> It took four years to eat them all.<br> The doctor said you got protein.<br> He was right.<br> Later on,<br> after Momma and Lunette died,<br> all Daddy was doing was killing<br> himself and chasing after me,<br> It would have beed good<br> to have had some rabbit stew.<br> That was when I run off to Birmingham.<br> That daddy of yours<br> must have been pretty awful.<br> Yeah, I guess he was.<br> How old were you when you ran away?<br> - Fourteen.<br> Fourteen? How did you live?<br> I looked a lot older,<br> so I worked as a waitress.<br> Your daddy killed himself?<br> He fell in the river drunk.<br> What was your momma like?<br> A saint. Just like your own.<br> What did she die of?<br> Same thing as Lunette, typhoid and TB.<br> Was Lunette like you?<br> - No, she was a lot nicer than me.<br> Lunette<br> was the sweetest girl who ever lived.<br> Mother says it's a miracle<br> you are like you are. - Like I am?<br> That your bad environment<br> didn't drag you down.<br> Buddy,<br> life ain't a picnic for nobody.<br> Don't you guess them millionaires<br> up there have troubles, too?<br> - Yeah.<br> Maybe it was eating all them<br> rabbits that made you so sexy.<br> Sex don't mean nothing to me.<br> It ain't nothing but a mosquito bite.<br> A mosquito bite?<br> Buddy, I'll tell you a secret.<br> Girls don't want sex.<br> Girls want love.<br> Mother says that. - Then it must be<br> true. When was your mum ever wrong?<br> I want to thank you<br> for a wonderful afternoon and evening.<br> Can I see you in the morning?<br> You sure can.<br> You'll never guess what happened.<br> I have met Mr. Right.<br> Who do you suppose he is?<br> The policeman whose thumb I bit.<br> He's Mr. Right.<br> I been with him.<br> Knowing the seriousness of marriage,<br> are you resolved to take your vows<br> before God and these people?<br> We are.<br> - Who gives this woman to be married?<br> You can sit down now.<br> Would you join your right hands?<br> David, repeat after me.<br> "I, David,<br> promise with God's help<br> to be your faithful husband,<br> to love and to serve you<br> as Christ commands,<br> as long as we both shall live. "<br> Rose?<br> "I, Rose,<br> promise with God's help<br> to be your faithful wife,<br> to love and to serve you<br> as Christ commands,<br> as long as we both shall live. "<br> Do I see a monkey?<br> You three want ice-cream?<br> Do you like picnics now? I love them!<br> It isn't a picnic, it's a barbecue.<br> A picnic doesn't involve roast meats.<br> At a barbecue<br> you have a lot of roast meats.<br> Well...<br> these kids still want ice-cream.<br> Come on.<br> We love you. We'll miss you.<br> - I love you guys.<br> We all love you.<br> Behave yourself, you hear?<br> I love you.<br> - I love you.<br> Did you give her a suitable goodbye?<br> Bye, Buddy.<br> I love you, Buddy.<br> I love you, too.<br> I'll miss you so much.<br> I love you all.<br> Thank God we're rid of her at last.<br> And she's happy,<br> that's the main thing.<br> Yes, she's happy.<br> Of course,<br> Dave doesn't have her life force.<br> Ain't much furniture in his house.<br> Her furniture comes out the windows.<br> Now, honey, he is Mr. Right.<br> Well, he adores her.<br> I hope she ain't too much for him.<br> What do you think, Brother?<br> He's crying, Mother.<br> Of course Dave wasn't Mr. Right.<br> He was Mr. Wrong.<br> It took her 4 husbands to find him.<br> They've been married for 25 years.<br> And I do believe<br> she has been a faithful wife.<br> Some people<br> might not believe it, but I think so.<br> I knew from the way<br> Daddy talked on the telephone...<br> ...there was sad news about Rose.<br> Maybe that's why<br> she had been so much on my mind.<br> Daddy?<br> Hello, old man. How you doing?<br> I'll be damned. Look who's here.<br> Good to see you, son.<br> - You too, sir.<br> You're looking chipper.<br> - You, too, how do you feel?<br> You bring any Yankee whiskey with you?<br> I don't mind. I'm only 133.<br> Now what's this about Rose?<br> You said you "sort of" heard from her?<br> There is some sad news.<br> I would have written, but I thought<br> I'd wait until you were here.<br> When I look at the river,<br> I feel like I'm a boy again.<br> I was 13 when I saw Rose<br> coming across the bridge<br> carrying that suitcase.<br> I remember that suitcase.<br> Well?<br> We have our drinks.<br> We're out here on the porch.<br> You have prepared me for it.<br> Rose isn't well.<br> Isn't that it? She's sick again?<br> No, son. She's dead.<br> Rose is dead?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> About a week ago.<br> Her husband phoned me. She asked him<br> to if anything happened to her.<br> You have<br> knocked me for a loop, old man.<br> I know.<br> You loved her.<br> You loved her, and so did I.<br> It was an awful shock to me, too, son.<br> Rose was so alive...<br> It's hard to believe.<br> Nobody lives forever,<br> and who'd want to?<br> That's a horrible thing to say.<br> Get a grip, boy. She had a good life.<br> She met Mr. Right.<br> What are you blubbering about?<br> I'm not blubbering.<br> Rose isn't dead, son, not really.<br> Some of us die,<br> and some of us don't.<br> Rose lives.<br> Don't worry about it, boy.<br> She's at rest with mother<br> in the creative universe.<br> She's at rest with mother.<br>
