                        The arrow which<br> felled the boar...<br> belonged to Lord lchimonji.<br> Drink to him !<br> The wily old beast...<br> shot out right<br> in front of me.<br> My horse reared...<br> Before I Could aim, off I fell.<br> Father...<br> shall we roast the boar?<br> He was old.<br> His hide is though, it stinks.<br> lndigestible.<br> Like me, old Hidetora<br> Would you eat me?<br> You'd stick in our throats.<br> That's why l joined your hunt...<br> to reinforce our friendship.<br> l, too!<br> l would cement the bonds...<br> between the houses of<br> lchimonji and Ayabe...<br> l would marry my daughter...<br> to your son Saburo.<br> Hold on!<br> That's my own intention.<br> Lord lchimonji,<br> the day is propitious.<br> Give us your answer.<br> Whom will you have for Saburo...<br> my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?<br> Not an easy choice.<br> Two daughters...<br> for one son.<br> A pity, Jiro, my second son,<br> already has a wife.<br> Kyoami!<br> Entertain us!<br> From the far mountain...<br> From the near mountain...<br> Who comes hippety-hopping...<br> Showing off his handsome ears?<br> A hare!<br> Only one hare, Kyoami?<br> Two, l think.<br> Hopping here to be eaten by<br> Father.<br> Suburo, that's rude!<br> Hold your tongue!<br> The Great Lord is tired.<br> Let us withdraw until he wakes.<br> This is unlike Father.<br> He only pretends to sleep.<br> After Saburo's insult...<br> how else could he save face?<br> All he did was hunt.<br> ln the old days...<br> he'd rout an army<br> and not be winded.<br> lt's impolite to our guests.<br> Kyoami, wake him !<br> Father worries me...<br> he's barely snoring today.<br> Father, what is it?<br> Are you ill?<br> A dream...<br> l had a dream.<br> l was in a strange land.<br> A vast wilderness.<br> l went on and on,<br> but met no one.<br> l called, l shouted...<br> but no one answered.<br> l was alone.<br> Alone in the wide world.<br> l felt a chill...<br> Such stupidity!<br> Taro's voice pulled me back...<br> l saw my beloved children.<br> Taro...<br> Jiro...<br> Saburo.<br> Father, l've never<br> seen you like this.<br> lt's not right.<br> Quiet, Saburo!<br> Be thankful we have his<br> affection.<br> l'm puzzled, too.<br> l can scarcely believe my ears.<br> Normally all he asks is our<br> obedience.<br> That's affection enough.<br> All right.<br> l've been considering an idea...<br> and l've reached a decision.<br> l want to tell it to you.<br> Now is a good time to do it...<br> while we have with us...<br> Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe.<br> Bring them !<br> l, Hidetora lchimonji...<br> was born in that small castle<br> in the mountains.<br> At that time,<br> this entire plain...<br> seethed with constant battle.<br> Many lords vied for power.<br> At the age of seventeen...<br> l flew my banner<br> over that castle.<br> l waged war for fifty years...<br> and at last the plain was mine.<br> l hoisted my colours<br> over the main castle.<br> l spent more years...<br> fighting lance to lance...<br> with these two gentlemen.<br> Now the moment has come...<br> to stable the steeds of war...<br> and give free rein to peace.<br> But old Hidetora...<br> is seventy years old.<br> l hereby cede total authority...<br> over all my dominions...<br> to my eldest son Taro.<br> My lord, this is so sudden...<br> Not at all.<br> l've thought long and hard.<br> There comes a time...<br> to step aside...<br> and pass on the reins<br> to younger hands.<br> I say to you: that time is now!<br> This is my will.<br> Taro is now head of the<br> lchimonjis...<br> lord of these lands.<br> l will quit the castle keep...<br> and move to the outer tower.<br> l will retain a 30-man escort...<br> and the title and insignia<br> of Great Lord.<br> But the actual leadership...<br> lies entirely with Taro.<br> l expect all of you to obey!<br> l'll obey.<br> But what about me and Saburo?<br> What do you intend for us?<br> l give you, Jiro and Saburo...<br> the Second and Third Castles...<br> with their attendant lands.<br> You will support Taro...<br> in the First Castle.<br> l shall be your guest...<br> visiting each castle in turn...<br> living out my remaining years.<br> How hard it is to be old.<br> l would speak.<br> l respect your wishes...<br> and appreciate your trust...<br> but l get you to reconsider.<br> Why?<br> Though l am your eldest son...<br> l could never take your place.<br> lt is too great a task.<br> l always pray to<br> the God of War...<br> "Let his life last 100 years..."<br> "even if it means<br> shaving a bit off mine."<br> What a pretty speech.<br> l cannot use such honeyed words.<br> l'd be embarrassed.<br> Don't be spiteful!<br> You mean Taro only flatters me?<br> Pay no attention to Saburo.<br> l feel the same as Taro.<br> We'd like nothing better...<br> than to stay behind your shield.<br> But it's our turn<br> to shield you...<br> from life's bitter arrows.<br> Well said, Jiro.<br> Bring me that quiver!<br> Break an arrow in two.<br> Can you do it?<br> Bundle them...<br> and try again.<br> A single arrow is easily broken.<br> Not so three together.<br> Whenever Taro is in trouble...<br> if you unite your forces...<br> the house of lchimonji<br> will be safe.<br> Even in a sheaf...<br> More of your pranks.<br> Stop being foolish.<br> lt's you who are foolish.<br> Your plan is absurd.<br> You are either senile or mad.<br> Silence!<br> Do not insult your father!<br> What madness have l spoken?<br> Wherein lies my senility?<br> l'll tell you.<br> What kind of world do we live<br> in?<br> One barren of loyalty and<br> feeling.<br> l'm aware of that.<br> So you should be!<br> You spilled an ocean of blood.<br> You showed no mercy, no pity.<br> We too are children<br> of this age...<br> weaned on strife and chaos.<br> We are your sons,<br> yet you count on our fidelity.<br> ln my eyes,<br> that makes you a fool.<br> A senile old fool!<br> So that's it!<br> You mean one day...<br> you'll forget l'm your father.<br> You'll betray me.<br> More folly!<br> Does a traitor betray himself?<br> Then you mean your brothers?<br> He's jealous of Taro's position.<br> ls that why you slander me?<br> Brother or not, watch your step!<br> Your lesson of the three arrows<br> was wasted.<br> The unity of the three sons is<br> split.<br> You scorn your father's wishes?<br> Parents and children<br> have no place in this worlds?<br> Very well, since you<br> will have it so...<br> l cut the bond between us!<br> You are a stranger to me.<br> Out of my sight!<br> You mustn't!<br> Quiet, Tango.<br> My mistake was to love him too<br> well.<br> l spoiled him.<br> lt's my fault he's arrogant.<br> But it's too late for regrets.<br> When flesh is rotten...<br> even our own...<br> cut it away!<br> Wait, my lord!<br> Master Saburo is blunt...<br> perhaps even disrespectful.<br> But his words are honest<br> and come from the heart.<br> Consider well: you will find...<br> he is not wrong.<br> -Silence!<br> -l will speak.<br> Begone!<br> l will stay.<br> You disobey me?<br> My duty to you is to speak my<br> mind.<br> Brandish your sword, l won't<br> move.<br> Revoke this rash decision.<br> Your insolence matches his!<br> l will not have it!<br> l banish you both!<br> Father!<br> What misery!<br> What will you do now?<br> l grieve for Father, not myself.<br> The horror ahead of him...<br> Tango, you're an idiot.<br> Why?<br> For defending me and being<br> banished.<br> Your place is with Father.<br> He needs you.<br> They're following us!<br> Wait, son-in-law!<br> Why do you run away?<br> Son-in-law?<br> Hear me out!<br> You're in disgrace,<br> exiled from your lands.<br> Lord Ayabe and l...<br> witnessed the whole incident.<br> You are an outcast...<br> little more than a beggar.<br> Forgive my rudeness...<br> What l'm trying to say...<br> l can't find the words.<br> The meaning is clear.<br> No lord chooses a beggar...<br> for his daughter.<br> Of course not.<br> No...now hold on!<br> Lord Ayabe rejected the<br> marriage.<br> But on my way home<br> l got to thinking...<br> of your extraordinary conduct.<br> l like the way you spoke up.<br> You have character and courage.<br> You'd make a fine son-in-law.<br> l retraced my steps...<br> but you had gone.<br> Does my offer interest you?<br> How can l know?<br> Then come stay with me...<br> while you think it over.<br> You too, Tango.<br> You are honest and loyal.<br> l can use you, will you come?<br> Thank you for your generosity...<br> but l cannot accept.<br> Whatever disguise<br> l must adopt...<br> l shan't abandon the Great Lord.<br> What's going on?<br> Hidetora's concubines<br> are moving from the castle.<br> They block my lady's retinue.<br> Scandalous!<br> l am now the mistress here!<br> They must make way!<br> My women kneeling to Taro's<br> wife?<br> lntolerable!<br> Why do you say that?<br> You gave him the castle keep.<br> lt's only natural.<br> Gives away his house...<br> Gives away his land...<br> His bounty earns him<br> a new title...<br> Lord of the rice fields.<br> A scarecrow!<br> Call me a fool?<br> No, the fool is me...<br> for serving as butt<br> to your laughing-stock.<br> But you're another for losing<br> your keep.<br> You know, Kaede...<br> the view is more pleasant...<br> now that is it mine.<br> As l recall...<br> a banner used to hang there.<br> Yes, Father's banner.<br> Also his helmet and armour.<br> Where are they?<br> l gave them to Father's men.<br> The armour doesn't matter.<br> But the banner...<br> My lord...<br> it belongs with the head<br> of the house of lchimonji.<br> But Father is keeping<br> his title and insignia.<br> Without them, you are a shadow.<br> What do you mean?<br> He made it clear...<br> that l am now in command.<br> ln that case...<br> behave as if you are.<br> You want the banner?<br> Ridiculous! You take<br> back what you give.<br> lt is Lord Taro's order!<br> See the lord, a gourd in the<br> wind.<br> Swinging this way...<br> Swaying that way...<br> Spinning as the breeze blows.<br> So high up, dangling<br> hollow from the tower.<br> lsn't it fun?<br> Villain! l'll teach you!<br> See the lord, a gourd in the<br> wind.<br> Swinging this way...<br> Swaying that way...<br> Spinning as the breeze blows.<br> So high up...<br> Dangling hollow from the tower.<br> What fun, what fun!<br> lt's Ogura.<br> l have a message.<br> Lord Taro is holding<br> a family gathering...<br> to celebrate the transfer<br> of power.<br> He invites his honoured father.<br> You too, Lord lkoma.<br> Your "family gathering"...<br> is only us?<br> Please, Father-in-Law...<br> won't you sit down?<br> l am to sit below you?<br> Who am l?<br> The honourable father of my<br> husband.<br> ls that all?<br> And the Great Lord...<br> is he dead?<br> Don't joke.<br> l'm not joking!<br> l retain my title and my status.<br> Have you forgotten?<br> No, of course not.<br> lt's you who forget...<br> you gave full authority to me.<br> What do you want?<br> l gave you this castle...<br> l moved out,<br> reduced my escort...<br> They may be few in number...<br> but they're boisterous enough.<br> What is that song?<br> With such goings-on...<br> how can l make myself obeyed?<br> They are warriors,<br> unschooled in manners.<br> They like comic songs.<br> Comic songs can go too far!<br> That song makes fun of me!<br> My guard was defending<br> my honour.<br> Yet you went ahead<br> and killed him.<br> l cannot allow that.<br> This once, l'll overlook it.<br> But l must have your promise...<br> that it won't happen again.<br> You will sign this...<br> and seal it with your blood.<br> "Pledge"...<br> This is nonsense!<br> Read it.<br> "Pledge"<br> "Firstly...<br> "l cede to Taro Takatora<br> the domains of lchimonji."<br> "Secondly..."<br> "l make him sole ruler<br> of the house of lchimonji."<br> "Thirdly..."<br> "Though l am Taro's father..."<br> "l shall submit<br> to his authority..."<br> "and act accordingly."<br> "l swear by all the deities."<br> "May they punish me<br> if l disobey."<br> l'm to seal this with my blood?<br> This silly thing?<br> Everything it contains...<br> was proclaimed by you<br> yourself...<br> before witnesses.<br> What does it change<br> if you sign it?<br> Are you a son?<br> What do you mean?<br> ls this a son's attitude?<br> The hen pecks the cock...<br> and makes him crow.<br> l will not stay here.<br> Fortunately...<br> l have another son.<br> Thank you, you did well.<br> l was born and raised<br> in this castle.<br> lt belonged to my father.<br> l left it to marry you.<br> My father and brothers,<br> after the marriage...<br> relaxed their vigilance.<br> Hidetora murdered them.<br> Now l am back<br> in my family castle...<br> How l have longed for this day.<br> Right there...<br> my mother took her own life.<br> Father is on his way.<br> My brother sent him packing.<br> He says Father grows<br> eccentric...<br> it would be unwise<br> to let him stay here.<br> Father's counsellor, lkoma...<br> is privy to my brother's plans.<br> This severity is unlike<br> Lord Taro.<br> And you, my lord...<br> why do you do nothing?<br> He's right.<br> You should succeed<br> the Great Lord.<br> Lord Taro is a weakling.<br> The stake is large:<br> gamble for it.<br> Then you are all willing...<br> to gamble with me?<br> Absolutely.<br> Dogs turn on a master...<br> who gives up the chase.<br> Sound the horn or become<br> the quarry.<br> How the dogs howl!<br> l must say, l find it unfair.<br> Born twelve months after Taro...<br> so all my life<br> l must grovel at his feet.<br> -Crack these bonds!<br> -Good for you, my lord!<br> Don't like your chops yet.<br> Taro is easy pickings.<br> His wife, Lady Kaede,<br> is another story.<br> Quite true.<br> She'd be a perfect match<br> for you.<br> Why not steal her?<br> Don't be impertinent.<br> First of all, there's Father.<br> He still has thirty warriors.<br> Each one is worth a thousand.<br> He'll soon be here...<br> and so will they.<br> Any ideas?<br> Open the gates!<br> Hidetora is here!<br> l will seek out Sue first.<br> Tell Jiro l want to see him.<br> Sue!<br> Praise be...<br> to the Eternal Western Paradise.<br> Praise be to<br> the Eternal Buddha...<br> in 36 trillion manifestations.<br> Praise be to Amida Buddha.<br> l knew you'd be here.<br> Father-in-Law!<br> Never mind the ceremony.<br> lt's been a long time.<br> Let me look at you.<br> Still the same sad face.<br> When l see you...<br> it breaks my heart.<br> lt's worse when you smile.<br> l burned down your castle...<br> you father and mother perished.<br> And you look at me like that.<br> Look upon me with hatred.<br> lt would be easier to bear.<br> Go on, hate me!<br> l don't hate you.<br> All is decided<br> in our previous lives.<br> The Buddha embraces all things.<br> Buddha again!<br> He is gone from this evil world.<br> His guardians are in exile...<br> routed by the fury of Ashur.<br> We can't rely on Buddha's mercy.<br> There you are, Jiro.<br> l've come to be your guest.<br> l'm disappointed in Taro.<br> l know everything.<br> lt's all in my brother's letter.<br> Taro wrote to you?<br> He says your guards...<br> were unruly and vulgar.<br> l am to receive you<br> with courtesy.<br> But l cannot let<br> your warriors...<br> inside the castle walls.<br> What's this??<br> l'm to come in alone...<br> leaving my men to rot outside?<br> My brother

face him.<br> On that point he's sane.<br> What about Master Saburo?<br> Would you like to see him?<br> The only way is to<br> bring Saburo here.<br> Maybe he can talk sense to him.<br> l'll be back as soon as l can.<br> Take good care of him.<br> Lady Kaede leads you<br> by the nose.<br> lf you wish to marry, fine.<br> But to kill Lady Sue for that?<br> Sometimes killing is necessary.<br> But to kill on a whim !<br> The order is unreasonable...<br> l must refuse.<br> Lord Kurogane...<br> At the Second Castle...<br> there is a supply of salt?<br> Of course...why?<br> When you bring back her head...<br> salt it first.<br> Otherwise, in this heat...<br> we'll be unable<br> to look at it.<br> Lady Sue is so beautiful...<br> it would be<br> ungracious to her.<br> Since you will go personally...<br> there will be no mistake.<br> Do it as you see fit.<br> Why stay with this mad old man?<br> lf the rock you sit on<br> starts to roll...<br> jump clear.<br> Or you'll go with it<br> and be squashed.<br> Only a fool stays aboard.<br> What is this place?<br> Paradise!<br> Think of it.<br> All my life...<br> l've been his nurse.<br> Good boy...<br> Sweet dreams.<br> l, Kurogane, am

to look.<br> What is this?<br> Your joking goes too far!<br> ls anything wrong?<br> lmagine that!<br> Lady Sue was a fox in disguise.<br> Enough of your tricks!<br> This is a statue from a shrine.<br> Clever fox--<br> first becomes human...<br> then turns himself to stone.<br> Are you making<br> a fool of me?<br> Certainly not.<br> There are many foxes hereabouts.<br> lt is said they take human form.<br> Take care, my lord.<br> They often impersonate women.<br> ln Central Asia a fox<br> seduced King Pan Tsu...<br> and made him kill 1,000 men.<br> ln China he married King Yu<br> and ravaged the land.<br> ln Japan, as Princess Tamamo...<br> he caused great<br> havoc at court.<br> He became a white fox<br> with nine tails.<br> Then they lost trace of him.<br> Some people say...<br> he settled down here.<br> So beware, my lord, beware.<br> This is how you<br> keep our bargain.<br> You conspire with Kurogane...<br> to humiliate me!<br> No, you're wrong.<br> lntolerable!<br> lt's Kurogane's doing.<br> Always Kurogane!<br> ls he your only vassal?<br> He's the villain who kills Taro.<br> He's the hero who saves Sue.<br> A two-headed monster!<br> This is your "right arm"?<br> Until l have Sue's head...<br> you shall not see me again!<br> Sister...my flute!<br> We've no time to get it.<br> l've had it since boyhood.<br> What shall we do?<br> Kurogane said<br> they'll pursue you.<br> l'll go back for the flute.<br> Your legs are old.<br> l'm the one to go.<br> We're near the ruins<br> of your castle.<br> Go there and pray for your dead.<br> You may never be back again.<br> Tsurumaru, let's hurry.<br> l see our castle...<br> what's left of it.<br> Which way, sister?<br> Over there.<br> Where?<br> Earth and sky are topsy turvy.<br> l was the fool<br> and made him laugh.<br> Now the coin is flipped.<br> Don't be mute,<br> say something.<br> You speak nonsense,<br> l'll speak truth.<br> We'll see what comes of it.<br> Begin, old man!<br> A serpent's egg<br> is white and pure.<br> A bird's is speckled and soiled.<br> This is a castle...<br> Here's a wall.<br> The bird left the speckled egg<br> for the white.<br> Strange...<br> The egg cracks,<br> out comes a snake.<br> Empty space above the wall.<br> Why?<br> The bird is gobbled<br> by the snake.<br> Where am l?<br> Who am l?<br> Stupid bird!<br> Saburo...<br> lt hurts.<br> l'm a worm,<br> don't crush me!<br> Who'd bother to crush a worm?<br> Who are you?<br> ls someone crying?<br> Who's crying?<br> Hell!<br> Man is born crying.<br> When he's cried enough, he dies.<br> Saburo has crossed the river.<br> He's now in Hachiman Field.<br> lt makes no sense.<br> What can he do with so few men?<br> Message from Lord Saburo.<br> He is here to find his father.<br> That done, he will<br> leave in peace.<br> Fujimaki is at the border.<br> l don't like it.<br> l didn't want reinforcements.<br> You should be glad.<br> Thanks to Fujimaki...<br> the enemy is<br> pinned down here.<br> We can rescue your father<br> from Azusa Plain.<br> But it looks so aggressive.<br> One false move could mean war.<br> Maybe l was too hasty.<br> My worry spurred me on, but...<br> my son-in-law will grumble.<br> Sitting here we pose no threat.<br> Prepare for battle!<br> My lord, this is ill advised.<br> Let Saburo have his father.<br> Avoid this war.<br> Once he has Father...<br> he'll accuse me of<br> treason and attack.<br> We can't give up Hidetora...<br> we don't know where he is.<br> There is much unrest<br> in the land.<br> Fujimaki and Ayabe<br> bide their time.<br> We need to retrench, not attack.<br> Lady Kaede awaits Lord Jiro...<br> to celebrate his<br> departure for battle.<br> A warlord doesn't<br> run to his woman.<br> Stay away!<br> When the enemy is assembled...<br> we can go after his lordship.<br> Be patient...<br> Rest the horses!<br> Dismount!<br> Weakling!<br> Kurogane has swayed you again.<br> No.<br> lt's no time for war.<br> Wars are won by strong leaders.<br> Why fear Fujimaki and Ayabe?<br> Your mistake...<br> was to spare Hidetora,<br> mad or not.<br> To kill him l have to find him.<br> Saburo knows where he is.<br> Otherwise he wouldn't have come.<br> Send him a message.<br> Say he can have his father.<br> Watch his movements<br> and send out your assassins.<br> l'm lost.<br> Such is the human condition.<br> This path...<br> l remember...<br> We came this way before.<br> Men always travel the same road.<br> lf you're tired of it, jump!<br> Up there.<br> Who is it?<br> Sue!<br> Sister, that voice...<br> This ruin was once a castle.<br> lt belonged to Sue's father.<br> l destroyed it.<br> Why am l here?<br> Why is Sue here?<br> And Tsurumaru, too.<br> ls this a dream?<br> No, this is Hell.<br> The lowest level of Hell.<br> Mount!<br> Message from Lord Jiro!<br> Very good.<br> He says he won't attack.<br> We're to leave<br> once we have Father.<br> Let's go at once.<br> We'd give away his whereabouts.<br> Wait till dark.<br> Ayabe is on the move.<br> Vulture! He smells blood!<br> Stay calm, my lord.<br> Ayabe is watching...<br> so is Fujimaki.<br> They're waiting.<br> Don't give them an excuse<br> to attack.<br> He wants Father<br> but makes no move.<br> What's his game?<br> She's taking so long.<br> l'll go see what's keeping her.<br> No, don't!<br> Never mind the flute.<br> You're acting like a child.<br> l don't want to be alone again.<br> You won't be alone.<br> The image of the Buddha Amida...<br> will protect you in my place.<br> Sister!<br> l won't be gone long.<br> Sister!<br> l found Kyoami...<br> crying on Azusa Plain.<br> Where's you master?<br> Forgive me!<br> He's disappeared.<br> You lost him on the plain?<br> Now we can't wait for dark.<br> l'm going to Azusa Plain.<br> Keep the enemy busy here.<br> Ten men follow Lord Saburo!<br> He's moving...<br> He's heading for Azusa Plain.<br> Gunnery captain!<br> Take your men to Azusa Plain...<br> and lay an ambush.<br> A reward for whoever<br> kills Saburo.<br> Are you mad?<br> Break your word and it's war!<br> So be it...it was inevitable.<br> Saburo is not our only enemy.<br> So what?<br> lf they attack, we retaliate.<br> We grab their land...<br> and enlarge our own.<br> Fine words,<br> but words don't win wars.<br> Where's the dog eager for prey?<br> Kaede's right.<br> You're a mouse posing<br> as a mastiff.<br> Kaede barks and you grovel.<br> Silence!<br> Stay behind!<br> lf you fear to fight, desert!<br> lf l deserted...<br> where would l go?<br> Captain!<br> You have your orders...go!<br> Message for Lord Saburo.<br> "Enemy gunners coming,<br> take care."<br> lnfantry...<br> Forward!<br> Thinks he's smart.<br> Get ready, men!<br> We're moving into the woods!<br> Father!<br> What a sky!<br> Am l in the other world?<br> ls this paradise?<br> Father!<br> Why are you so cruel?<br> Why pull me from my grave?<br> Don't you know me?<br> Father!<br> Father?<br> What do you mean by "father"?<br> Wait...l remember.<br> l had three sons.<br> Are you one of them?<br> Yes. l am Saburo.<br> Saburo?<br> lt's you!<br> l have no face to show you...<br> no words to excuse myself.<br> Give me poison to drink.<br> l'll swallow it gladly.<br> Don't talk like that.<br> l don't hate you, Father.<br> No sweet lies; l've had my fill.<br> Does he look like a hypocrite?<br> True, soft words often deceive.<br> But my lord...look at him !<br> Tears like this...<br> can only come from the heart.<br> Come with me.<br> You'll live with us...<br> and forget this bad dream.<br> lf only you can forget...<br> my cruelty to you.<br> Forgive me.<br> l am a stupid old fool.<br> Attack!<br> The enemy is in the woods.<br> Our superior strength<br> is useless there.<br> Then we'll burn them out!<br> Charge!<br> Pull back!<br> We outnumber them.<br> Crush them !<br> Ayabe is marching<br> on the First Castle.<br> lmpossible.<br> He's on the ridge!<br> Those troops are a decoy.<br> Pull back!<br> Forward!<br> That's enough.<br> Another cheer!<br> l have so much to say.<br> When we're alone and quiet...<br> we will talk, father to son.<br> That's all l want.<br> Nothing else.<br> He is dead.<br> l know when one is dead.<br> He is dead.<br> You and l live, but Saburo...<br> You can't die.<br> l have tales to tell...<br> forgiveness to ask.<br> ls this justice?<br> Are you gone forever?<br> Keep away!<br> lt grows dark...<br> Senile old fool.<br> Do not call back his spirit.<br> He has suffered enough.<br> Lord Saburo!<br> Victory is ours!<br> The enemy is retreating<br> with Ayabe in pursuit.<br> We've won!<br> Alas!<br> lt doesn't seem possible.<br> He isn't here to share this.<br> Hidetora is also gone...why?<br> Are there no gods...no Buddha?<br> lf you exist, hear me!<br> You are mischievous and cruel!<br> Are you so bored up there...<br> you must crush us like ants?<br> ls it such fun to see men weep?<br> Enough!
