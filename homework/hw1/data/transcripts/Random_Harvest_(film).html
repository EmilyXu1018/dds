                        Our story takes you down|this shadowed path...<br> to a remote and guarded building|in the English Midlands:<br> Melbridge County Asylum.<br> Grimly proud of its new military wing...<br> which barely suffices...<br> in this autumn of 1918...<br> to house the shattered minds...<br> of the war that was to end war.<br> Now, Mr. And Mrs. Lloyd...<br> I should warn you|that even if he is your son...<br> he may not recognize you.<br> His memory is affected,|and he has trouble with his speech:<br> The result of shock.<br> He was picked up by the Germans...<br> in a shell hole near Arras in 1917...<br> close to death|and with no means of identification.<br> When he returned to consciousness|in a German hospital...<br> he could remember nothing at all|of his past life.<br> He had no name...<br> he had no family|with whom he could correspond.<br> Six months ago, he was exchanged|through Switzerland and sent here.<br> I sincerely hope he proves to be your son.<br> I believe that he could be cured...<br> with patience and care|in normal surroundings.<br> May we see him now?<br> Certainly.<br> Please, Mrs. Lloyd, don't hope too much.|I've seen many disappointments.<br> Good morning, boys.|This is just an informal visit.<br> Good morning, Clayton.<br> Sleeping better? You just keep it up.<br> Well, now, Trempitt, what's going on?<br> I thought you and I were friends.|Last time we shook hands.<br> Don't you remember?<br> Well, don't bother today|if you don't feel like it.<br> You can't discourage me.<br> There. You see, my boy? That's the spirit.<br> You and I will be going into town|very soon for a glass of beer...<br> to Melbridge Arms.<br> Would you like that?<br> Fine. Won't be long now.<br> Well, Smith...<br> you are looking better, really improved.<br> - Don't you think so, Doctor?|- Very much.<br> We have some news for you. Interested?<br> There are some people here|who are very anxious to see you.<br> Mr. And Mrs. Lloyd.<br> Lloyd?<br> The name mean anything to you?<br> Their son was reported missing in 1917.<br> At Arras.<br> Now don't pin your hopes on it.<br> You may be their son, you may not.<br> We'll soon know.<br> My parents.<br> There. You see, my boy?|You speak well enough when you want to.<br> It's just a matter of confidence.<br> You've just got to|get back your confidence.<br> My father.<br> Doctor, dress him up a bit|and take him to the reception room.<br> Very well. Come along, Smith.<br> Lloyd.<br> Sit down, old man.<br> If they are your parents...<br> They would take me out of here?<br> That's rather a big if, old man. Sit down.<br> Lloyd.<br> - He is not your son, then?|- No.<br> I'm sincerely sorry.<br> I told you, my boy, not to count on it.<br> Out in this weather, Major?|You are a one for a walk, ain't you?<br> Proper old pea soup this is.<br> I'm all right, thank you.<br> Coat's very warm.<br> I like to walk.<br> Proper old pea soup.<br> The war's over! Peace!<br> There's an armistice!<br> What is it you want?<br> Come on, I haven't got all night.<br> Cigarette.<br> What sort?<br> Why, you're from the asylum. You're...<br> It's all right, dear. You take your time.<br> Have a nice look around, see.|I'll be back in a jiffy.<br> You are from the asylum, aren't you?<br> Yes, but I'm all right, really.<br> If you have given them the slip,|I wouldn't stay here.<br> She's gone straight to the phone.|She's telling them to come for you.<br> Can I help you?<br> I thought you weren't feeling too fit,|so I followed you.<br> You don't mind, do you?<br> You look tired out.<br> Been walking about for hours?<br> Well, how about a brandy and soda...<br> just to pull you together?|I'm gonna have one.<br> Shall we go over to the home pub?|It's just across the road.<br> It's not the Ritz, but it's where we all stay|when our show's in town.<br> It's, you know, friendly.<br> Come on.<br> Excuse us, please.<br> That was Ella. She's our character woman,|and he's our manager.<br> - Hello, Sam.|- Hello, Paula.<br> He's a dear, really.<br> - Hello, Paula.|- Hello, Brett.<br> Have a drink, and the army, too.<br> - There, you see? You're amongst friends.|- Mind you, he was game, the gunner was.<br> Halfway through the 10th,|he run into my right hook...<br> and forgot his name and address.<br> You don't win fights|with your hands and feet.<br> You win them with your brains.<br> That's what brought me to the top.<br> What's it to be, my dear?|This is on the house.<br> Thank you, Biffer.<br> Mine's a Gin and French.|Can I have a brandy for my friend here?<br> With pleasure, my dear.|Looks as though he could do with it.<br> Feeling bad?<br> - No, I...|- He's just tired, that's all.<br> Not the flu, is it? Got them in the back.<br> Dying like flies at the hospital.<br> That's right, cheer him up.|Know any more funny stories?<br> I was only passing a remark.|It's a free country.<br> Pass him the free drink.|That'll do him more good.<br> Well, here it is,|and a drop of good stuff that is.<br> - Bring anybody back from the grave.|- The grave?<br> Aren't you a little ray of sunshine tonight?<br> - Paula. Don't be late.|- No, I won't, Sam.<br> I've got to get over to the theater.|Goodbye, and thanks for the drinks.<br> - Shall we go?|- Well, there goes a hero for you.<br> - He's one of the men what done it.|- Right.<br> I must get over to the theater.|I've cut it pretty close.<br> It doesn't seem very friendly, does it,|running away like this?<br> What are you going to do?|Will you be all right?<br> - What am I to do with you?|- I'll be all right.<br> I'm not so sure.<br> Listen, how'd you like to see the show?<br> You can sit in my dressing room,|see the stage. No one will bother you.<br> Then we'll have a chat, shall we?<br> Just you and I,|and settle what's to be done.<br> Good? Good, come on.<br> Sorry to keep you waiting all this time,|but I'm so excited about peace.<br> I've got one eyebrow halfway up my|forehead and the other behind my left ear.<br> Just a second. I'll be with you.<br> Well? How do you like me?<br> Or don't you?<br> Good.<br> Now, talk to me.|Tell me all about yourself.<br> Why'd you give them the slip up|at the hospital?<br> You don't like the place?<br> Surely you ought not to be there.<br> Come on. Answer me.<br> Cat got your tongue?<br> Make an effort.<br> I'm all right, really.<br> It's my speech. It's just nerves.<br> There, you see? You're doing splendidly.<br> Yes, I wasn't so bad then, was I?<br> I should say not.<br> You don't know what a job I have...<br> as a rule.<br> I can guess. I heard you up at that shop.|That old witch would scare anybody.<br> There's another thing.<br> I've lost my memory.<br> I don't even know who I am.<br> You mean...<br> I know who you are.|You're somebody awfully nice.<br> What did they call you at that place?<br> Smith.<br> It's not my real name.<br> - What's yours?|- Paula Ridgeway.<br> That's not my real name, either.<br> Look here, Smithy. You don't mind|if I call you Smithy, do you?<br> It can't be good for you up there|among all those poor souls.<br> You can't be happy.<br> And how are you ever going to get better|if you're unhappy?<br> Perhaps I shouldn't be very happy...<br> anywhere just now.<br> But, Smithy, the war's over.|Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br> I'm just silly. Don't take any notice.|It's the day.<br> It's so splendid for most of us|and so sad for some.<br> Why did it have to be foggy and wet?<br> It should have been all sunshine|and golden day.<br> Never mind, Smithy.|We've met, anyway, haven't we?<br> Have you no friends,|no parents that you can trace?<br> Have you tried?<br> Some people|came to see me at the hospital...<br> but I wasn't their son.<br> I'll bet they were disappointed,|weren't they?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> I was, too.<br> I'd have liked to belong to them.<br> Smithy, you're ruining my makeup.<br> But how you do chatter.<br> Yes, I seem to have talked rather a lot.<br> That's me. I always bring people out.<br> Much too far, sometimes.<br> - Ridgeway.|- All right, thank you.<br> I've got to go and perform now.<br> Smithy, look...<br> I'll put your chair outside. Come along.<br> You can see the front of the stage|from here.<br> Just sit there and nobody will bother you.|I'll be back in a couple of shakes.<br> - You'll be all right, will you?|- I'm fine.<br> Sure?<br> Your head seems awfully hot.<br> - Paula. You're on.|- Coming.<br> I spoke to her father and asked,|"Could I marry Daisy?"<br> "Certainly you can," he says.<br> "Certainly. On one condition."<br> "Name it!" says I.<br> Says he, "Get married in the house|and after the ceremony...<br> "you leave by the back door."<br> "Leave by the back door?|Why would we do that?"<br> He say, "I'm telling you,|you leave by the back door...<br> "so that the hens|can get the benefit of the rice."<br> I love her for herself alone.<br> She's the bonniest wee lassie|in all Scotland.<br> As Harry would say...<br> I knew the minute I seen him,|he had the flu.<br> Biffer, there's something|I ought to tell you.<br> - He's from the county asylum.|- No.<br> But he's all right, really.<br> He would have been discharged|if he had a home to go to.<br> You don't think they'll come after him,|do you?<br> Any busybody comes snooping after him...<br> I'll give him what I give the gunner.<br> - Biffer, you're a darling.|- He's a gentlemen, he is.<br> Liked him the minute|I first clapped eyes on him.<br> I'm all right.<br> It's just my speech. I can't remember.<br> Rest now, Smithy. You mustn't talk.<br> I'm not like the others.<br> I'm not like them. I'm all right.<br> Yes, Smithy, you're all right.<br> But I can't go back.<br> If I go back, I'll never come out.|I'll be like the others.<br> You shan't go back, Smithy.|I won't let you go back.<br> Rest now.<br> Rest, Smithy.<br> Just go to sleep.<br> Hurry down. Supper's on the table.|The train leaves at 1:00.<br> I'm all packed. I'll be back in a jiffy.<br> How did the show go?<br> Splendidly. The last night.<br> Glad to get rid of us, I expect.<br> How did you get on?<br> I talked to the chambermaid today.<br> - Had quite a chat with her.|- You did?<br> Wonderful. What about?<br> The weather.<br> You are coming on.<br> I see you're all packed. That's a good boy.|So am I.<br> Our train leaves at 1:00.<br> - Paula.|- Yes, Smithy?<br> You're sure I can be useful?<br> Your manager isn't just taking me on...<br> because you asked him?<br> Good gracious, you don't know Sam.|He's as hard as nails.<br> No, you can take my word for it.|The whole thing was his idea.<br> I can't tell you what it means, Paula.<br> To be someone again, to be wanted.<br> It's all your doing.<br> How you do run on.<br> There's no stopping you|once you've started.<br> You just eat your supper.<br> I'll go down and I'll be up again|in time to fetch you for the train.<br> Goodbye.<br> - The usual?|- Please, Biffer.<br> Sam, he's as pleased as punch.|I wish you could have heard him.<br> You are an angel.<br> That's all right, old girl.<br> It's given him confidence|just knowing that he's wanted.<br> That's all he needs to get well.<br> - There you are.|- Thank you, Biffer.<br> Evening, Mr. W. What's it to be?<br> Half and half, and rush it, will you?|They've been watching me like hawks...<br> since I blotted me copybook|Armistice Day.<br> Why?<br> One of our loonies slipped off in the fog...<br> while I was supposed to be|watching the gate.<br> Got clean away, uniform and all.<br> No. Really?|But you got him back, didn't you?<br> Not yet, but we shall.<br> - What sort of a bloke?|- It's getting late.<br> Tallish, dark hair, shuffles a bit.<br> Can't get his words out.|Always thinking something different.<br> He's not dangerous, I suppose?<br> There's no saying with loonies.|Quiet as mice for weeks.<br> Then all of a sudden,|up and after you with an ax.<br> Sam, I'm going in to supper. You coming?<br> Just a moment, Paula.<br> - Ella, coming?|- Coming.<br> It's time, isn't it? Nearly 12:30.<br> - Smithy.|- I'm all ready.<br> Sit down a minute, will you?<br> There's nothing wrong, is there?<br> Smithy, I've got to talk to you.<br> I won't beat about the bush.|Sam won't take you.<br> Won't take me?<br> There was a man from the asylum|in the bar just now.<br> He told everybody about your escape.<br> Sam feels it's too risky taking you.<br> I think perhaps he's right.<br> I think perhaps you should go back|to the asylum...<br> until you're all well again, and then...<br> Go back?<br> It is best, Smithy.<br> You need care, and you need doctors|that understand your case.<br> I feel dreadful about it,|but it's for your sake.<br> Sam wants to help...<br> but he says I have no right to take you.<br> He says I'd be risking your sanity.<br> Your life, perhaps.|You do understand, don't you?<br> You're not angry with me? You don't think|that I've gone back on you?<br> It's not that I'm afraid.<br> It's because I think it's right.|They were all against me, all of them.<br> They couldn't have made me do it|if I didn't think it was right.<br> You do know that, Smithy, don't you?<br> Tell me you understand,|that you're not angry with me.<br> But tell me. Let me hear you say it.<br> Speak to me, Smithy.<br> You could always speak to me.<br> Wait for me, Smithy.<br> Come on, Smithy. Get your coat on.<br> I know I'm right. I know it.<br> I'm ashamed of myself,|letting them talk me out of it.<br> Here. Let me help you. We'll have to hurry.<br> Don't you worry, Smithy.|We can't go with the others...<br> but we'll find some quiet place|where you can rest and get fit.<br> Here's your hat. Take your parcels.|Come on.<br> We'll go by the back door.<br> I've got to see the Biffer.<br> Go that way. Don't let anyone see you.|There's a door leading to the alley.<br> Wait for me outside. I'll only be a minute.<br> Biffer, here's the money for my bill.<br> What? Off already?<br> They want to send Smithy|back to the asylum.<br> No.<br> I'm not gonna let him go.|I'm taking him into the country.<br> Giving up your job?<br> I'll let you know when we get settled.<br> - Will you send my trunk on to me?|- You bet, and good luck to you.<br> Thanks, Biffer.|You're one in a million. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye. Good luck.<br> Smithy, what have you done?<br> - He tried to stop you?|- Yes.<br> Sam?<br> I pushed him and he fell.<br> If they get you now, you're done for.<br> - I'm no good. Let me alone.|- No. I won't.<br> - We can't leave him.|- We must.<br> We'll think later. Come.<br> But I'm no good. I'd better go back.<br> That was bad luck, the stationmaster|recognizing me at Melbridge.<br> They may have wired ahead|to Canford to stop us.<br> Well, we won't go on to Canford.<br> We'll get out at Swinton Junction.<br> From Swinton, we can go into|the west country to Devon or Cornwall.<br> We'll choose some little country place,|quiet and lovely.<br> It's the end of the world.<br> Lonely and lovely.<br> We'll be safe here, even if...<br> We'll phone first, and then we'll see.<br> All right, Mrs. Deventer, he can come|for a couple of hours tomorrow...<br> and I'll look in on Friday.<br> - Thank you, Doctor.|- Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Morning, ma'am.|- Good morning.<br> Sorry I wasn't down.<br> - Were you wanting rooms?|- Well, that depends.<br> - May I use your telephone?|- Certainly.

I remember he was quite annoyed...<br> when you came to me.|He called me a pirate.<br> That was not fair.|It was really all my doing.<br> Indeed?<br> I'd heard Miss Lindy was leaving you,|and I applied for the position.<br> May I ask why?<br> A few weeks before, I'd come across|a picture of you in a magazine.<br> Underneath, it said,|"Industrial Prince of England."<br> - Dear me.|- I was impressed.<br> I decided then I must leave|Harwood and Williams to better myself.<br> I'm sincerely glad you did.|You make things much easier for me.<br> What's all this?<br> That's the report on that firm|in the Midlands.<br> The Melbridge Cable Company.<br> Yes, my brother thinks this would be|a very valuable subsidiary.<br> I have a large file.|Photographs of the works.<br> - Would you care to see it?|- Please, yes.<br> Bring me|the Melbridge Cable Company report.<br> Yes, Miss Hanson.<br> Hello.<br> Yes, I did, Mr. Manders.|Can you make it 4:30 this afternoon?<br> That would be splendid. He's very busy.|Thank you.<br> Market reports?<br> In 10 minutes, and thanks|for the flowers. They're lovely.<br> I thought you'd like them.<br> Thank you, Sheila.<br> Their equipment's up-to-date.<br> And they seem to have plenty of space.<br> It does seem worth investigating.<br> I'll get my brother to run down.<br> I'm taking a long holiday.<br> - Are you? At once?|- In about a month or so.<br> Why, I think that's a very good idea.<br> I may be gone a year.|If things can be arranged.<br> A year?<br> If it's humanly possible.<br> I'm being married, Miss Hanson.<br> You're the first to hear my news.<br> I'm afraid it'll mean|a lot of extra work for you...<br> putting things in order so I can get away.<br> - It's Miss Chilcet, I suppose.|- Yes, it's Kitty.<br> - Was it so obvious?|- Not at all. She's a very charming girl.<br> Yes, I fully agree.<br> I hope you won't take it into your head|to follow my example, Miss Hanson.<br> I don't know what I should do without you.<br> I have been married, Mr. Rainier.<br> Remember, I told you|when I took the position.<br> Yes, to be sure. It slipped my memory.<br> You had a child, I believe.<br> Yes. A little boy. He died.<br> Yes. I remember. I'm sorry.<br> You'll see that Mr. Chetwynd gets this,|will you?<br> And I'll let him have the file later.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, he's here. Miss Chilcet.<br> Hello.<br> Definitely. You want me to confirm it|in writing?<br> You absurd young person.<br> What's that? No, Kitty. Of course not.<br> - Paula, don't.|- John, let me tell him.<br> - That you're his wife?|- Yes.<br> You can risk it, if you wish.<br> I hope you won't.<br> But what do I risk now?<br> What do you want of him, Paula?|His name? His protection?<br> I want him as he was.<br> I want his love.<br> Paula, two years ago,|you walked into his office.<br> If the sight of you|did nothing to restore his memory...<br> what can words do?<br> When you came to me at Melbridge|shortly after he disappeared...<br> I told you I was sure|he hadn't deserted you knowingly.<br> I told you a door in his mind had opened,|but another had closed.<br> I warned you even that if you found him...<br> the chances were|he wouldn't recognize you.<br> You gave me a hope.<br> There's always that hope,|but the impetus must come from within.<br> It can't be forced on him from outside.<br> You can tell him the truth|and claim your legal rights.<br> But what is going to be his attitude|when a strange woman appears...<br> and suddenly claims to be his wife?<br> He'd resent me.<br> He'd accept me.<br> He'd pity me...<br> and he'd resent me.<br> I can only offer you that frail hope|that someday the miracle will happen...<br> and he'll come back to you,|not as Charles Rainier, but as...<br> What was it you used to call him?<br> - Smithy.|- As Smithy...<br> with all his emotion for you|as warm and intact as it was...<br> on the day he left you.<br> That's not much help to me, John, is it?<br> I'm real, these tears are real,|and my jealousy is real...<br> and my need of him.<br> Paula, I wish I could help you.<br> What will you do?<br> I don't know. I'll have to think it out.<br> - You go to your dinner.|- I'll call it off if you'll dine with me.<br> No, don't do that.<br> Dear John. Always firm, but kind.<br> Thank you for the hope.<br> That is rather nice of me,|seeing that it robs me of mine.<br> Good night, John.<br> The law is quite clear on that point,|Mrs. Smith.<br> If it is proved that for a period of|not less than seven years...<br> no news of a person has been received...<br> by those who would naturally hear of him|if he were alive...<br> then he may be legally presumed dead.<br> You wish me to take the necessary steps?<br> Please.<br> Now, to complete the particulars.<br> Did you prosecute a search?<br> Yes, we investigated accidents|that had occurred on that day.<br> - Without result?|- Yes.<br> Then I became seriously ill.<br> I was ill for many months. My baby died.<br> As soon as I could get about,|I made some effort to return to the stage...<br> but without success.<br> I worked as a waitress, a saleswoman.<br> I studied stenography at night school.<br> Spent every penny I could spare|trying to trace my husband.<br> Thought he might have been taken|to a hospital...<br> or perhaps an asylum.<br> But years passed,|and I found no trace of him.<br> Are you employed at present?<br> For the last two years,|I've worked as a private secretary.<br> - To whom?|- To Mr. Charles Rainier.<br> I've studied your petition, Mrs. Smith...<br> and the affidavits attached.<br> In regard to the evidence presented,|I have entered the decree to the effect...<br> that the man known as John Smith|shall be presumed to be dead...<br> and your marriage to him|consequently dissolved.<br> Hello, you two!<br> I wish you'd remember|you're getting married on Wednesday.<br> That odd little Mr. Beddoes|has been waiting in the chapel for ages.<br> Oh, dear! How dreadful of me. I forgot.|He wants us to choose the hymns.<br> We'll go down. Back in a few minutes.|What's for tea?<br> Muffins, old boy! Terrific!<br> That's nice.<br> I forget the words.<br> Yes, I remember now.<br> Then there's another lovely one.|Nearly always used.<br> This, perhaps: O Perfect Love.<br> Yes, that's it.<br> I like that. Don't you, Charles?<br> What is it, Kitty?<br> I'm sorry, darling.|I must have been dreaming.<br> It's all right, Charles.<br> I'm glad it happened.<br> - It's better.|- Better?<br> What has happened?<br> I've been uncertain.<br> Almost from the beginning.<br> Now I'm sure.<br> It's no use, is it?<br> I've always known it. Really.<br> I was grasping selfishly|at my own happiness.<br> Because you could make me|perfectly happy.<br> If I were selfish enough not to care...<br> or stupid enough not to know.<br> To know what?<br> That I'm not the one.<br> Let's be honest about it.<br> I was letting things drift.<br> But I never really believed in my own luck.<br> Charles, you looked at me just now|as if I were a stranger.<br> An intrusive stranger.<br> Trying to take the place of someone else.<br> Someone else?<br> I know it sounds absurd, but let me say it.<br> Sometimes...<br> especially when we've been closest...<br> I've had a curious feeling|that I remind you of someone else.<br> Someone you once knew.<br> Don't leave me, Kitty. I need you.<br> I'm trying to make a life.<br> With someone you love|as you'll never love me.<br> I am nearly the one, Charles.<br> So nearly that I shall always be proud of it.<br> But nearly isn't enough for a lifetime.<br> It would be too hard to...<br> I've left it rather late, haven't I? I'm sorry.<br> I think I'll travel.<br> Mother's going to Luxor, I believe.|I'll go with her.<br> - Kitty...|- It's all right, Charles.<br> I asked for it, and I'll get over it.<br> One does, you know.<br> I shan't go in any tragic mood...<br> but looking to see what fun I can find,|and I usually can.<br> You'll probably hear|that I've married some nice man.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> You don't have to say anything.<br> But because I am so nearly the one...<br> and because I love you|more than anyone I shall ever marry...<br> will you kiss me goodbye?<br> Well, we can't keep this up indefinitely.<br> Where in the devil is he?<br> No normal man walks out of a big concern|without saying a word to a solitary soul.<br> Everything was arranged.|Could he have gone abroad?<br> He would have let us know.|Confound that girl!<br> What the deuce could have happened?<br> One minute they were picking hymns|for the wedding...<br> - Mr. Chetwynd?|- What now?<br> I'm sorry, sir. It seems to be important.|Stourton of the Lytham Liberal League.<br> All right, I'll see him. You talk to Sheldon.<br> Sheldon, when did you say|you last saw Mr. Rainier?<br> It was close to dinnertime, miss.|About an hour after Miss Kitty left.<br> Mr. Charles asked me|to put some things into a bag for him.<br> I don't know quite why, miss...<br> but I sort of think|that he may have gone to Liverpool.<br> - To Liverpool?|- Yes, miss.<br> It was from Liverpool he came that night...<br> that he came back from the dead,|as you might say.<br> Please try to tell me everything you|can remember about that night in 1920.<br> What did he tell you|about what had happened to him?<br> Well, miss, it was a wet night.|In November, it was.<br> He'd been knocked down by a taxi and|carried into a chemist's shop in Liverpool.<br> Come in.<br> Miss Hanson.<br> Please forgive me for coming.|We were all so anxious.<br> You're not well.<br> I should have let you know where I was.|I intended to. I'm sorry.<br> I hate to bother you,|but something very important came up.<br> How did you know I was in Liverpool?<br> - Something Sheldon said. I made inquiries.|- Sheldon, yes.<br> Won't you sit down, Miss Hanson?<br> You say some important business|induced you to follow me?<br> Sir Edward Lake, Member of Parliament|from West Lytham...<br> died on Monday morning.|There will be a by-election.<br> This morning, a committee|of the West Lytham Liberal Association...<br> unanimously decided|to support your candidacy...<br> should you consent to stand|in the Liberal interest.<br> Did Sheldon tell you of my experience here|about 12 years ago?<br> Yes, Mr. Rainier.<br> I came back here at that time...<br> hoping to stumble on the trail of my past...<br> but I failed then...<br> and I've failed now.<br> - Nothing helped you?|- Nothing.<br> Why should I feel|a sense of loss so acute that...<br> That it's spoiling your life?<br> No, I'm not being honest with myself.<br> My life's not complete,|and I've hurt others.<br> I don't know why I bore you|with my affairs.<br> You feel that perhaps|you lived in Liverpool?<br> - It seems possible.|- But not certain.<br> You mean I might have been|visiting the city?<br> Well, Liverpool's a big port.<br> I might have come in on some ship.|Strange. That hadn't occurred to me.<br> Or by train.<br> You might have come in|from a nearby town...<br> or from the country.<br> - Perhaps on business.|- Perhaps.<br> In that case,|maybe you stayed at some hotel.<br> I know Liverpool. I've been up here often.<br> You know the direction you were|walking in when the accident happened?<br> Yes, I checked that.<br> I was walking down Mason Street|toward the square. It was wet.<br> Well, there are two hotels|north of Mason Street.<br> There's the old Olympic|and the Great Northern.<br> It's quite a distance from the Olympic.<br> So, if it was wet, the chances are,|you were coming from the Great Northern.<br> Presuming I stayed at a hotel at all,|under what name was I registered?<br> There's just one chance to find out.<br> If you were at a hotel, you walked out|leaving unclaimed luggage.<br> Would they keep it so long?<br> - It's worth investigating.|- Yes.<br> I'm glad you came, Miss Hanson.|You've given me fresh hope.<br> You must come with me.|We'll start with the Great Northern.<br> Please be kind enough to tell the manager|this suitcase is of no interest to me...<br> and I'm sorry to have troubled him.<br> John Smith.<br> Highly unimaginative incognito.<br> What could be more anonymous|than these poor rags?<br> - Nothing seemed familiar to you?|- No.<br> There's a finality|about that most unrewarding find:<br> Like a door slammed and bolted.<br> Now I shall learn to accept myself|for what I am:<br> A psychological defective.|As Kitty saw me. As you must see me.<br> You must keep my secret, Miss Hanson.<br> Will you send a telegram|to the West Lytham Liberal Association...<br> telling them|I'll receive the Committee tomorrow?<br> Yes, Mr. Rainier.<br> - There's an express to London at 8:15.|- I'll make reservations.<br> Congratulations, Mr. Rainier.|Famous victory.<br> The Prime Minister's delighted.|Our new member from Lytham.<br> - Yes. Congratulations.|- Thank you.<br> - It's good to have you with us, sir.|- Thank you.<br> - The party is honored, Mr. Rainier.|- Thank you, sir.<br> - Mr. Rainier, congratulations.|- Thank you very much.<br> Miss Hanson.<br> My compliments, Mr. Rainier.|A great triumph.<br> Thank you.<br> Have I kept you waiting? I was delayed.<br> Nice of you to come down for my debut.<br> - Was I satisfactory?|- Very.<br> Waiter, some tea, please.<br> What would you like? Cake? Sandwiches?<br> - Bring an assortment.|- Thank you.<br> By the way, I haven't really thanked you|for your help in the campaign.<br> I don't know what I should have done|without you.<br> I thoroughly enjoyed it.|Politics interest me.<br> Do they? I'm glad of that.<br> You're staring at me, you know.<br> I'm sorry. It struck me|your hair is bright red in the sunshine.<br> Was that all?|You were looking so intensely.<br> Everyone has these feelings of having|lived through certain moments before.<br> You mean, you have the feeling|that you've known me before?<br> I had, for a moment.<br> As a matter of fact, I felt it quite strongly|the first day you came into my office.<br> - You didn't show it.|- No?<br> - Is that why you engaged me?|- Perhaps.<br> It was also your air of quiet efficiency.<br> Forgive me...<br> but is there any possibility|that you might marry again?<br> Not the slightest.<br> I'm asking you|because I have a proposal to make.<br> I need your help in my parliamentary life.<br> - Social secretary?|- Not exactly.<br> You know...<br> it seemed quite a reasonable idea|when it came to me.<br> But now, I'm rather losing my nerve.<br> Why? Is it so startling?<br> It may sound outrageous to you,|but it's not a sudden impulse.<br> I've thought it over very carefully.<br> You and I are in the same boat,|Miss Hanson.<br> We're both ghost-ridden.<br> That sounds a bit romantic,|but I think it expresses it.<br> We are prisoners of our past.<br> Yes.<br> What if we were to pool our loneliness...<br> and give each other what little we have:|Support, friendship?<br> I'm proposing marriage, Miss Hanson.<br> Or should I call it a merger?<br> You know, I'm good at mergers.<br> A Member of Parliament|should have a wife, Margaret.<br> So I'm told on all sides.|"He needs a clever hostess."<br> You have exceptional gifts.<br> Would it interest you|to have a wider field for them?<br> You need have no fear that I would make|any emotional demands upon you.<br> I have only sincere friendship to offer.<br> I won't ask any more from you.<br> Please. Don't answer at once.|Think it over.<br> It's completely a selfish proposal...<br> but I can't have you giving me notice,|you know.<br> I'd be lost without you.<br> Miss Hanson... Margaret...<br> - have I hurt you?|- I don't know.<br> This comes of boasting that I never cry.<br> You will think about it?|I'll call you tomorrow.<br> No, I can't wait so long.|Tonight, about 9:00?<br> I hope the answer will be yes.<br> Here's the tea.<br> It wasn't a very flattering proposal, really.<br> Rather, a suggestion for a merger.<br> He used that very expression.<br> - Pretty cold-blooded, isn't it?|- Well, it's honest.<br> I'm sorry. Sorry for myself.<br> - I want you to be happy, Paula.|- It may work out.<br> He might even fall in love with me.<br> Would that be so very extraordinary?<br> It would be very extraordinary if he didn't.<br> But the situation is very extraordinary.<br> It seems rather hard,|what I'm going to say...<br> but if you marry him, keep to his terms.<br> I suppose you're right.<br> And you love him?<br> Yes.<br> You're going to be hurt, Paula.<br> John, don't be against it.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, Mr. Rainier.<br> Charles. You're early.<br> It's yes, Charles.<br> Isn't that Mrs. Rainier,|who gives those political dinners?<br> Lady Rainier.|He was in the birthday honors.<br> They say he'll be in the Cabinet.<br> Pity there's no son to inherit the title.<br> Such a wonderful couple.|I hear he's devoted to her.<br> Well, it's really amazing.|She's got him to dance.<br> She's got him to smile, too.|That woman is a marvel.<br> Good night, Sheldon, and thank you.|You managed beautifully.<br> Thank you, milady.<br> - Thank you, Sheldon.|- Good night, Mr. Charles.<br> You certainly mellowed the old gentleman.<br> He was positively purring|when I put him into the car.<br> Yes, I think he really enjoyed himself.<br> - I know I did.|- Nonsense.<br> Good heavens! It's nearly 3:00.|You have two committees tomorrow.<br> - Today.|- Yes, that's true. It's nearly morning.<br> The morning of May 25.|Does that suggest something to you?<br> It's the anniversary of our wedding.|Our third anniversary.<br> Will you wait just a moment?|You don't look the least bit tired.<br> All my gratitude goes with this, Margaret.<br> I owe you more than I can put into words.<br> It's too beautiful, really. You spoil me.<br> The emerald is said to have belonged|to the Empress Marie Louise.<br> Really? That's thrilling.<br> Will you put it on for me?<br> There. How do you like it?<br> Do you know|you're a very beautiful woman?<br> Thank you. I rather hoped|you thought that.<br> Margaret...<br> are you happy?<br> - Why do you ask?|- A twinge of conscience.<br> - Lf I hadn't interfered in your life...|- I should have never been Lady Rainier...<br> entertained the Prime Minister,|worn a queen's emerald.<br> Is it enough?<br> Perhaps not.<br> Is there anyone else?<br> No.<br> - Charles, why are you asking me?|- Because if there were...<br> I've often wanted to say this,|I wouldn't hold you to our bargain.<br> I haven't the right.<br> - You're trying to get rid of me, Charles?|- You know I'd be utterly lost without you.<br> I'm glad to hear that,|because I like my job.<br> A woman told me tonight that she|envied me more than anyone she knew.<br> She envied me my husband, Charles.<br> Most women do.<br> Now I really am tired.<br> Good night, Charles,|and thank you for the wonderful present.<br> Good night, Margaret.<br> Smithy!<br> Margaret, I'm afraid|I said something to hurt you.<br> No, Charles.<br> If I expressed myself clumsily...<br> - It's nothing, really. It's just that...|- I wish you would be frank with me.<br> Do you?<br> Were those a gift?<br> Yes.<br> I came across them quite by chance.<br> They're just cheap little beads.<br> But they have a value for you|that this does not?<br> He said they were the color of my eyes.<br> They are, aren't they?<br> Oh, Margaret.<br> Isn't there something morbid|in burying one's heart with the dead?<br> - That's a strange thing for you to say.|- Is it?<br> You haven't even a memory.<br> No.<br> And the best of you...<br> Your capacity for loving...<br> your joy in living is buried|in a little space of time you've forgotten.<br> - It isn't quite the same thing.|- Why not?<br> Because in some vague way, I still have...<br> - Hope?|- Yes, I suppose that's it.<br> Have you, Charles?<br> Do you feel that there really is someone?<br> That someday you may find her?<br> I'd rather not talk of it, Margaret.<br> It's nothing I could put into words.<br> But doesn't it frighten you sometimes...<br> that the years are passing...<br> that you may sometime find that|you've lost your capacity for happiness?<br> You may have come so near her.<br> You may even have brushed by her|in the street.<br> Yes, I've thought of that.<br> You might even have met her, Charles.<br> Met her and not known her.<br> It might be someone you know.<br> Charles, it might even be me.<br> Oh, Margaret.<br> I know I'm talking wildly.<br> - It's after 3:00, and I'm tired.|- Yes.<br> I've sometimes thought I'd like to travel.|I feel I need a change and a rest.<br> - To travel?|- Yes. I've never been out of England.<br> I'd like to go to Buenos Aires or Rio|or somewhere colorful and distracting.<br> Perhaps when the House adjourns...<br> I don't want to drag you away.|I'll take a maid. Or a friend, perhaps.<br> Margaret, I believe|you want to get away from me.<br> No.<br> It's just that it's been a strain.<br> I'm just a little nobody, you know.|It's been harder than I thought...<br> being the wife of Charles Rainier.<br> If you wish, of course.<br> You are a little overtired, I think.<br> - Shall we talk about it in the morning?|- In the morning, yes.<br> - Good night, Margaret.|- Good night, Charles.<br> Smithy.<br> I think this is my compartment.<br> Yes, it is.<br> I hope Harrison|has made everything smooth for you.<br> Thanks. Yes, he's been very helpful.<br> He should be here any moment|with my letter of credit.<br> Will you have only two days|in the country?<br> Yes. My boat sails on Wednesday.<br> - It's on your way, this place.|- No. It's in Devon.<br> It's a quiet little country village...<br> with a delightful old inn.|I wanted to see it again.<br> I was once very happy there.<br> I'm glad I'm not late. Hello, sir.<br> I made you out an itinerary.|I thought you'd like to study it on the ship.<br> How kind of you.<br> - Here's your letter of credit.|- Thank you.<br> And some magazines.|I'll put these in the compartment.<br> I think you'll find everything in order.<br> - I hope you have a wonderful trip.|- Thank you.<br> Don't stay away too long.<br> If I do, blame your excellent arrangements.<br> - Goodbye.|- Goodbye.<br> I'll wait for you, sir.|I have a message from Mr. Chetwynd.<br> Well, goodbye, Charles.<br> Margaret, I wish you weren't going.<br> I don't feel quite happy about it.<br> - You'll let me hear from you?|- Of course.<br> Goodbye.<br> - You're going to the house?|- No, to the office.

Right-o, sir.|Here we are, sir.<br> Is that the proprietor?<br> Yes, sir. That's the Biffer.|Was, I should say.<br> He ain't much like that now.|That's him at the end.<br> He was a gentleman, the gunner was.<br> Not like these softies|what call theirselves heavyweights today.<br> Why, he'd take two of them for breakfast!<br> He didn't wear no fancy dressing gown...<br> Well, we mustn't lose our train.|We better go.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - The fog's getting thicker.|- Yes. Beastly.<br> - Cigarette?|- Sorry. I don't smoke.<br> Of course not.<br> Never mind. There's a little tobacconist|just around the corner.<br> Well?<br> - Packet of Barclay Blue Ribbons, please.|- Yes, sir.<br> - Thank you, sir.|- Thank you.<br> - Good night, sir.|- Good night.<br> I thought you said|you'd never been in Melbridge.<br> I haven't.<br> But you said, "There's a little tobacconist|just around the corner."<br> You said, "There's a little tobacconist|just around the corner."<br> I said that?<br> That shop was off the main street.<br> You couldn't have seen it|on your way from the station.<br> No.<br> Then how did you know of it?<br> - I don't know.|- You went straight to it.<br> I did know, but I don't know how.<br> - Melbridge.|- What's the matter?<br> Melbridge.<br> Are you ill, sir? Let me get a cab.<br> No, let me think. There's something.<br> That shop...<br> That woman.<br> There's a taxi. I'll get it.<br> Here you are, sir.<br> Where is the hospital?<br> You mean the old one or the new one, sir?<br> The old one, I think.<br> It's on a hill.<br> Big gates...<br> a high wall all around it.<br> That don't sound much like either of them.<br> You wouldn't be meaning the asylum,|would you, sir?<br> Look here, sir.<br> You say you came out of these gates?<br> Yes. I'm sure of that.<br> There was some excitement|and a great deal of noise.<br> Then let's start from here.<br> Try and retrace your steps.<br> Now.<br> You must have gone into town.<br> Yes, I'd been to that shop.<br> Perhaps as we go,|you can piece the thing together.<br> Yes, that's right. That's a good idea.<br> I came along this path.<br> - You remember that?|- Yes, I think so.<br> There was a good deal of fog...<br> and people shouting, and the sound of...<br> Like I was trying to get away|from something...<br> trying to escape.<br> There was some danger, and I was afraid.<br> I was...<br> There was a girl.<br> Yes, there was a girl!<br> The mist is lifting.<br> Yes. It looks as if it will be|a nice day after all.<br> Could you take the luggage|to the station and wait for me?<br> I've lots of time. I think I'd like to walk.<br> Right you are, ma'am.|I'll wait for you by the newsstand.<br> You're leaving us now?|I do hope you'll come and see us again.<br> Not very soon, I'm afraid.<br> - I'm sailing for South America at 2:00.|- You are? My, I envy you.<br> Are you sure|you'd prefer to walk to the station?<br> Yes. Such a pretty walk.<br> I used to live here, you know, years ago.<br> Mrs. Deventer's time. Did you know her?<br> No, not very well.|She died three years ago.<br> So Albert was telling me.<br> She was quite a character, Mrs. Deventer.|Lots of people ask after her.<br> There was a gentleman in here|a few minutes ago...<br> asking after Mrs. Deventer|and the old vicar.<br> Really? I should be going.|I don't want to have to hurry.<br> Goodbye, Miss Barnes. Thank you.<br> - I'm sure you'll have a wonderful trip.|- Thank you.<br> Did you say a gentleman|was asking for Mrs. Deventer?<br> Yes, miss, and the old vicar.<br> That's Mr. Durham, you know.|He lives at Seven Oaks.<br> Mr. Pauly's our vicar now.<br> - Is the gentleman staying here?|- No.<br> He was looking for a cottage.|Said he used to rent one here years ago.<br> He remembered it was near the church.<br> Was he a friend of yours, miss?<br> Excuse me.<br> Smithy?<br> Oh, Smithy!<br> Darling!<br> Paula!<br>
