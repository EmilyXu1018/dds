                        Men, are you over 40?<br> When you wake up in the morning,<br> do you feel tired and rundown?<br> Do you have that listless feeling?<br> - Jefferies.<br> - Congratulations, Jeff.<br> - For what?<br> - Getting rid of that cast.<br> Who said I was getting rid of it?<br> This is Wednesday.<br> Seven weeks from the day<br> you broke your leg. Yes or no?<br> Gunnison, how did<br> you get to be such a big editor<br> with such a small memory?<br> Thrift, industry and hard work...<br> and catching the publisher<br> with his secretary.<br> - Did I get the wrong day?<br> - No.<br> No, wrong week.<br> Next Wednesday I emerge from this...<br> plaster cocoon.<br> That's too bad, Jeff.<br> Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.<br> Forget I called.<br> Yeah, I sure feel<br> sorry for you, Gunnison.<br> Must be rough on you thinking of me<br> wearing this cast for another week.<br> That one week is gonna cost<br> me my best photographer,<br> and you a big assignment.<br> Where?<br> There's no point<br> in even talking about it.<br> Oh, come on, come on. Where ?<br> Kashmir. Got a code tip from<br> the bureau chief this morning.<br> The place is about to go up in smoke.<br> What did I tell you? Didn't I tell<br> you that's the next place to watch?<br> - You did.<br> - When do I leave? Hour?<br> - With that cast on? You don't.<br> - Stop sounding stuffy.<br> I can take pictures from a jeep<br> or a water buffalo, if necessary.<br> You're too valuable to the<br> magazine for us to play around with.<br> - I'll send Morgan or Lambert.<br> - Morgan or Lambert.<br> That's fine.<br> I get myself half-killed for you,<br> and you reward me<br> by stealing my assignments.<br> I didn't ask you to stand in<br> the middle of an automobile racetrack.<br> You asked for something<br> dramatically different.<br> - You got it.<br> - So did you.<br> - Goodbye, Jeff.<br> - Now, wait a minute, Gunnison.<br> You've got to get me out of here.<br> Six weeks sitting<br> in a two-room apartment<br> with nothing to do but look out<br> the window at the neighbours.<br> - Bye, Jeff.<br> - No, Gunnison, l...<br> If you don't pull me out<br> of this swamp of boredom,<br> I'm gonna do something drastic.<br> - Like what?<br> - "Like what?" Get married.<br> Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.<br> It's about time you got married,<br> before you turn into<br> a lonesome and bitter, old man.<br> Yeah, can't you just see me?<br> Rushing home to a hot apartment<br> to listen to the automatic laundry<br> and the electric dishwasher<br> and the garbage disposal<br> and the nagging wife.<br> Jeff, wives don't nag<br> any more, they discuss.<br> ls that so? ls that so?<br> Maybe in the high-rent district<br> they discuss.<br> In my neighbourhood, they still nag.<br> Well, you know best.<br> I'll call you later.<br> Yeah, have some good news<br> the next time, huh?<br> Good morning. I said, "Good morning!"<br> Oh, good morning.<br> Say, I wouldn't dig so deep<br> if I were you.<br> You're giving them far too much water.<br> Why don't you shut up?<br> Well!<br> I do declare.<br> State sentence<br> for a peeping tom,<br> is six months in the workhouse.<br> Oh, hello, sweetheart.<br> They got no windows in the workhouse.<br> In the old days, they used to put<br> your eyes out with a red-hot poker.<br> Any of those bikini bombshells<br> you're always watching<br> worth a red-hot poker?<br> Oh, dear.<br> We've become a race of Peeping Toms.<br> What people ought to do<br> is get outside their own house<br> and look in for a change.<br> Yes, sir. How's that for<br> a bit of homespun philosophy?<br> Reader's Digest , April 1939.<br> Well, I only quote from the best.<br> You don't have to take<br> my temperature this morning.<br> Quiet. See if you can break 100.<br> You know, I should have been<br> a gypsy fortune-teller<br> instead of an insurance company nurse.<br> I got a nose for trouble.<br> Can smell it ten miles away.<br> You heard of that market crash in '29?<br> I predicted that.<br> Just how did you do that, Stella?<br> Oh, simple. I was nursing<br> a director of General Motors.<br> "Kidney ailment," they said.<br> "Nerves," I said.<br> Then I asked myself,<br> 'What's General Motors<br> got to be nervous about?"<br> "Overproduction," I says. "Collapse."<br> When General Motors has to go<br> to the bathroom ten times a day,<br> the whole country's ready to let go.<br> You know, Stella,<br> in economics, a kidney ailment<br> has no relationship to the stock market.<br> - None whatsoever.<br> - Crashed, didn't it?<br> I can smell trouble<br> right here in this apartment.<br> First you smash your leg,<br> then you get<br> to looking out the window,<br> see things you shouldn't see.<br> Trouble.<br> I can see you in court now<br> surrounded by a bunch of lawyers<br> in double-breasted suits.<br> You're pleading.<br> You say, "Judge,<br> it was only a bit of innocent fun.<br> I love my neighbours, like a father."<br> And the judge says,<br> 'Well, congratulations.<br> You've just given birth<br> to three years in Dannamora."<br> Right now, I'd welcome trouble.<br> You've got a hormone deficiency.<br> How can you tell from a thermometer?<br> Those bathing beauties<br> you've been watching<br> haven't raised your temperature<br> one degree in a month.<br> Here we go.<br> One more week.<br> I think you're right.<br> I think there is gonna be<br> trouble around here.<br> I knew it.<br> Ooh. Do you ever heat that stuff?<br> Gives your<br> circulation something to fight.<br> - What kind of trouble?<br> - Lisa Fremont.<br> You kidding?<br> She's a beautiful, young girl,<br> and you're a reasonably<br> healthy young man.<br> - She expects me to marry her.<br> - That's normal.<br> - I don't want to.<br> - That's abnormal.<br> I'm just not ready for marriage.<br> Every man's ready for marriage<br> when the right girl comes along.<br> Lisa Fremont is the right girl<br> for any man with half a brain<br> who can get one eye open.<br> She's alright.<br> - What did you do, have a fight?<br> - No.<br> - Father loading up the shotgun?<br> - What?<br> - Please, Stella.<br> - It's happened before, you know.<br> Some of the world's<br> happiest marriages have<br> started 'under the gun,'<br> as you might say.<br> - No, she's just not the girl for me.<br> - Yeah, she's only perfect.<br> She's too perfect. She's too talented.<br> She's too beautiful.<br> She's too sophisticated.<br> She's too everything, but what I want.<br> Is what you want<br> something you can discuss?<br> What? It's very simple, Stella.<br> She belongs to that rarefied<br> atmosphere of Park Avenue:<br> expensive restaurants<br> and literary cocktail parties.<br> People with sense<br> belong wherever they're put.<br> Can you imagine her tramping around<br> the world with a camera bum<br> who never has more than<br> a week's salary in the bank?<br> If she was only ordinary.<br> You never gonna get married?<br> I'll probably get married<br> one of these days,<br> but when I do, it's gonna be<br> to someone who thinks of life<br> not just as a new dress<br> and a lobster dinner<br> and the latest scandal.<br> I need a woman who's willing to...<br> Hold it.<br> Who's willing to go anywhere<br> and do anything and love it.<br> So the honest thing for me to do<br> is just call the whole thing off.<br> Let her find somebody else.<br> Yeah, I can hear you now.<br> "Get out of my life,<br> you perfectly wonderful woman."<br> Look, Mr Jefferies,<br> I'm not an educated woman,<br> but I can tell you one thing.<br> When a man and a woman see<br> each other and like each other,<br> they ought to come together, wham,<br> Iike a couple of taxis on Broadway<br> and not sit around analysing each other<br> Iike two specimens in a bottle.<br> There's an intelligent way<br> to approach marriage.<br> Intelligence.<br> Nothing has caused the human race<br> so much trouble as intelligence.<br> Modern marriage.<br> - No, we've progressed emotionally.<br> - Baloney.<br> Once it was see somebody,<br> get excited, get married.<br> Now, it's read a lot of books,<br> fence with a lot of four-syllable<br> words, psychoanalyse each other<br> until you can't tell the difference<br> between a petting party<br> and a civil service exam.<br> People have different emotional levels -<br> When I married Myles, we were both<br> a couple of maladjusted misfits.<br> We are still maladjusted, and we<br> have loved every minute of it.<br> Well, that's fine, Stella.<br> Now, would you<br> fix me a sandwich, please?<br> Yes, I will. And I'll spread<br> a little common sense on the bread.<br> Lisa's loaded to her fingertips<br> with love for you.<br> I got two words of advice<br> for you: Marry her.<br> - She pay you much?<br> - Oh.<br> There you are.<br> - Here's the key.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well, if you want anything, just ring.<br> Honey.<br> Come on.<br> Got to carry you over the threshold.<br> Window shopper.<br> How's your leg?<br> It hurts a little.<br> - And your stomach?<br> - Empty as a football.<br> And your love life?<br> Not too active.<br> Anything else bothering you?<br> Mm-hm.<br> Who are you?<br> Reading from top to bottom:<br> Lisa...<br> Carol...<br> Fremont.<br> Is this the Lisa Fremont who<br> never wears the same dress twice?<br> Only because it's expected of her.<br> It's right off the Paris plane.<br> - Do you think it'll sell?<br> - That depends on the quote.<br> Let's see now.<br> There's the aeroplane ticket over,<br> import duties, hidden taxes,<br> - profit markup -<br> - A steal at $1,100.<br> Eleven hundred?<br> They ought to list that dress<br> on the stock exchange.<br> We sell a dozen a day<br> in this price range.<br> Who buys them, tax collectors?<br> Even if I had to pay,<br> it would be worth it.<br> - Just for the occasion.<br> - Why, is something big going on?<br> It's going on right here. It's a big night.<br> It's just an old<br> run-of-the-mill Wednesday.<br> The calendar's full of them.<br> It's opening night of the last depressing<br> week of L B Jefferies in a cast.<br> Well, I haven't noticed<br> a big demand for tickets.<br> That's because I bought out the house.<br> You know, this cigarette box<br> has seen better days.<br> I picked that up in Shanghai,<br> which has also seen better days.<br> It's cracked and you never use it.<br> It's too ornate.<br> I'm sending up a plain, flat,<br> silver one with your initials.<br> That's no way to spend<br> your hard-earned money.<br> I wanted to.<br> Ooh!<br> What would you think of<br> starting off with dinner at '21 '?<br> You have, perhaps,<br> an ambulance downstairs?<br> No, better than that: '21 '.<br> Thank you for waiting, Carl.<br> The kitchen's right there on the left.<br> I'll take the wine.<br> - Good evening, Mr Jefferies.<br> - Carl.<br> Just put everything<br> in the oven, Carl, on low.<br> - Let's open the wine now.<br> - Alright.<br> - It's a Montrachet.<br> - A great big glassful.<br> There's a corkscrew right over there.<br> Here, I'll do it.<br> - Big enough?<br> - Yeah, they're fine.<br> I can't think of anything more<br> boring or tiresome<br> than what you've been through<br> and the last week must be the hardest.<br> Alright. Yeah, I want to get<br> this thing off and get moving.<br> Well, I'm going to make this<br> a week you'll never forget.<br> Fine, thanks.<br> Just a minute, Carl.<br> - This will take care of the taxi.<br> - Thank you, Miss Fremont.<br> - Have a pleasant dinner, Mr Jefferies.<br> - Alright, Good night.<br> Good night.<br> What a day I've had.<br> - Are you tired?<br> - Not a bit.<br> I was all morning in a meeting,<br> then I had to dash to the Waldorf<br> for a quick drink with Madam Dufrene,<br> who's just over from Paris<br> with some spy reports.<br> Then I had to go to '21' and have lunch<br> with the Harper's Bazaar people.<br> That's when I ordered dinner.<br> Then I had two fall showings<br> Then I had to have a cocktail<br> with Leland and Slim Hayward.<br> We're trying to get his new show.<br> Then I had to dash back and change.<br> Well, now, tell me,<br> what was Mrs Hayward wearing?<br> - She looked wonderfully cool.<br> - She didn't, did she?<br> She had on the most divine<br> ltalian hand-printed -<br> - Oh, ltalian?<br> - Oh, you.<br> - Italian. Imagine.<br> - To think I planted three nice items<br> - in the columns about you today.<br> - You did?<br> - You can't buy that kind of publicity.<br> - I know.<br> Someday you may want to<br> open up a studio of your own here.<br> How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?<br> Jeff...<br> Isn't it time you came home?<br> You could pick your assignment.<br> - I wish there was one I wanted.<br> - Make the one you want.<br> - You mean leave the magazine?<br> - Yes.<br> - For what?<br> - For yourself and me.<br> I could get you a dozen<br> assignments tomorrow:<br> - Fashions, portraits.<br> - Now, don't laugh. I could do it.<br> - That's what I'm afraid of.<br> Can you see me driving down<br> to the fashion salon in a jeep<br> wearing combat boots and a three-day<br> beard? Wouldn't that make a hit?<br> I could see you looking<br> very handsome and successful<br> in a dark blue, flannel suit.<br> Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?<br> Hm?<br> Guess I'd better<br> start setting up for dinner.<br> # To see you<br> # ls to love you<br> # And I see you<br> # Everywhere<br> # ln the sunrise<br> # ln the moonglow<br> # Anyplace I look<br> # You're there<br> # To see you<br> # ls to want you<br> # And I see you all the time<br> # On a sidewalk<br> # ln a doorway<br> # On the lonely stairs I climb<br> # Someday<br> # Let me show you<br> # How happy endings start<br> # You'll find<br> # how well I know you<br> # Cause to know you at all<br> # ls to know you by heart<br> # To see you<br> # ls to love you<br> # And you're never out of sight<br> # And I love you<br> # And I'll see you<br> # ln the same old dream<br> # Tonight #<br> Miss Lonelyhearts.<br> At least that's something<br> you'll never have to worry about.<br> Oh?<br> You can see my apartment from here,<br> all the way up on 63rd Street?<br> No, not exactly,<br> but we have a little apartment here<br> that's probably as popular as yours.<br> You remember, of course,<br> Miss Torso, the ballet dancer?<br> She's like a queen bee<br> with her pick of the drones.<br> I'd say she's<br> doing a woman's hardest job.<br> Juggling wolves.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, she picked the most<br> prosperous-looking one.<br> She's not in love with him...<br> or any of them.<br> Oh, how can you tell that from here?<br> You said it resembled<br> my apartment, didn't you?<br> I hope they're cooked this time.<br> Where's that<br> wonderful music coming from?<br> Some songwriter over there<br> in the studio apartment.<br> Well...<br> He lives alone.<br> Probably had a very unhappy marriage.<br> Oh, it's enchanting.<br> It's almost as if it were<br> being written especially for us.<br> Hm. No wonder he's having<br> so much trouble with it.<br> At least you can't say<br> the dinner isn't right.<br> Lisa... it's perfect.<br> As always.<br> There can't be that much difference<br> between people and the way they live.<br> We all eat, talk, drink,<br> laugh, wear clothes.<br> Well, now look -<br> If you're saying all this because<br> you don't want to tell me the truth,<br> because you're hiding something from<br> me, then maybe I can understand.<br> I'm not hiding anything. It's just that -<br> It doesn't make sense.<br> What's so different about it here<br> from there or anyplace you go<br> that one person couldn't live<br> in both places just as easily?<br> Some people can.<br> Now, if you'll just let me -<br> What is it but travelling from<br> one place to another taking pictures?<br> It's like being a tourist<br> on an endless vacation.<br> OK. That's your opinion.<br> You're entitled to it.<br> - Now, let me give you my side.<br> - It's ridiculous to say<br> that it can only be done by a special,<br> private little group of anointed people.<br> I made a simple statement,<br> a true statement,<br> but I can back it up if you'll just<br> shut up for a minute.<br> If your opinion is as rude as your<br> manner, I don't think I care to hear it.<br> Oh, come on now. Simmer down.<br> I can't fit in here. You can't fit in there.<br> According to you, people<br> should be born, live and die<br> - on the same spot!<br> - Shut up!<br> - Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?<br> - Of course not.<br> Well, you might have to<br> if you went with me.<br> Did you ever try to keep warm<br> in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,<br> Oh, I do it all the time,<br> whenever I have<br> a few minutes after lunch.<br> Did you ever get shot at? Run over?<br> Did you ever get sandbagged<br> because somebody got unfavourable<br> publicity from your camera?<br> Did you ever... Those high heels,<br> they'll be great in the jungle.<br> And the nylons<br> and those six-ounce lingerie.<br> - Three.<br> - Alright, three.<br> They'll make a big hit in Finland,<br> just before you freeze to death.<br> Well, if there's one thing I know,<br> it's how to wear the proper clothes.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Well, try and find a raincoat in Brazil,<br> even when it isn't raining.<br> Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.<br> Your home<br> is the available transportation.<br> You don't sleep very much.<br> You bathe less.<br> And sometimes the food that you eat<br> is made from things that you couldn't<br> even look at when they're alive.<br> Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately<br> repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.<br> Deliberately repulsive?<br> I'm trying to make it sound good.<br> You just have to face it, Lisa,<br> you're not meant for that kind of a life.<br> Few people are.<br> - You're too stubborn to argue with.<br> - I'm not stubborn. I'm just truthful.<br> I know, a lesser man would have<br> told me it was one long holiday,<br> and I would have awakened<br> to a rude disillusionment.<br> Well, now, wait a minute.<br> If you want to get vicious on this thing,<br> I'd be happy to accommodate you.<br> No, I don't particularly want that.<br> So that's it?<br> You won't stay here,<br> and I can't go with you.<br> It would be the wrong thing.<br> You don't think either one<br> of us could ever change?<br> Right now it doesn't seem so.<br> I-l'm in love with you.<br> I don't care what you do for a living.<br> I'd like to be part of it somehow.<br> It's deflating to find out<br> the only way I can be part of it,<br> is to take out a subscription<br> to your magazine.<br> I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.<br> There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.<br> You've got this town<br> in the palm of your hand.<br> Not quite, it seems.<br> Goodbye, Jeff.<br> You mean good night.<br> - I mean what I said.<br> - Well, Lisa...<br> couldn't we just...<br> Couldn't we just...<br> keep things status quo?<br> Without any future?<br> Well, when am I gonna see you again?<br> Not for a long time.<br> At least... not until tomorrow night.<br> Hey! Rain.<br> Grab that. Wait, I'll get the clock.<br> Oh, no!<br> Pull it.<br> Pull on it. Let me do it.<br> In you go.<br> No, you can't come in.<br> It's much too late.<br> No, not now.<br> No, I said good night.<br> What's that supposed to be, ma'am?<br> It's called hunger.<br> You'd think the rain<br> would have cooled things off.<br> - All it did was make the heat wet.<br> - Ahh, that's it.<br> That's stiff right there. Right there.<br> The insurance company<br> would be much happier<br> if you'd sleep in bed at night<br> instead of in that wheelchair.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Eyes are all bloodshot.<br> Must have been watching<br> out that window for hours.<br> Yeah, I was.<br> What are you gonna do<br> if one of them catches you?<br> It depends which one.<br> Miss Torso, for example -<br> You keep your mind off her.<br> She sure is the<br> 'eat, drink and be merry' girl.<br> Yeah, she'll wind up fat,<br> alcoholic and miserable.<br> Yeah.<br> Speaking of misery,<br> poor Miss Lonelyhearts.<br> She drank herself to sleep again, alone.<br> Poor soul. Maybe one day<br> she'll find her happiness.<br> Yeah, and some man will lose his.<br> Isn't there anybody in the<br> neighbourhood<br> who could cast an eye in her direction?<br> Well...<br> It might just be that the salesman<br> will be available soon.<br> Oh, him and his wife splitting up?<br> I just can't figure it.<br> He went out several times<br> last night in the rain,<br> - carrying his sample case.<br> - Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?<br> What would he be selling<br> at three o'clock in the morning?<br> Flashlights.<br> Luminous dials for watches.<br> House numbers that light up.<br> I don't think so.<br> I don't think so.<br> I think he was taking<br> something out of the apartment.<br> Uh-huh. His personal effects.<br> He's gonna run out on her, the coward.<br> Yeah. Sometimes it's worse<br> to stay than it is to run.<br> Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low<br> type of man to do a thing like that.<br> How about this morning?<br> Any further developments?<br> The shades are all drawn<br> in the apartment.<br> - In this heat?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, they're up now.<br> - Get back! Get back.<br> - Where do you want me to go?<br> - Come on, get out of sight.<br> - What's the matter?<br> That salesman's looking out of<br> his window. You see?<br> Get back! He'll see you.<br> I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.<br> That's no ordinary look.<br> That's the kind of look a man gives<br> when he's afraid somebody<br> might be watching him.<br> Get away from there.<br> He'll be after you.<br> Go on, into the house.<br> Into the house. Shoo, shoo.<br> Goodbye, Mr Jefferies.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - And don't sleep in that chair again.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> "Uh-huh. Uh-huh."<br> Great conversationalist.<br> Stella...<br> Take those binoculars out<br> and bring them here, will you?<br> Trouble.<br> I can smell it.<br> I'll be glad when they crack<br> that cast, and I can get outta here.<br> Uh-huh.<br> How far does a girl have to go<br> before you'll notice her?<br> Well, if she's pretty enough,<br> she doesn't have to go anywhere.<br> She just has to 'be.'<br> Well, ain't l?<br> Pay attention to me.<br> I'm not exactly<br> on the other side of the room.<br> Your mind is... and when<br> I want a man, I want all of him.<br> Don't you ever have any problems?<br> I have one now.<br> So do l.<br> Tell me about it.<br> Why?<br> Why would a man leave<br> his apartment three times<br> on a rainy night with a suitcase,<br> and come back three times?<br> He likes the way his wife<br> welcomes him home.<br> No, no. Not this salesman's wife.<br> And why didn't he go to work today?<br> Homework. It's more interesting.<br> What's interesting about a butcher knife<br> and a small saw<br> wrapped in newspaper?<br> Nothing, thank heaven.<br> Why hasn't he been<br> in his wife's bedroom all day?<br> I wouldn't dare answer that.<br> Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.<br> There's something terribly wrong.<br> - And I'm afraid it's with me.<br> - What do you think?<br> Something too frightful to utter.<br> He went out a few minutes<br> ago in his undershirt, hasn't come back.<br> That would be a terrible job to tackle.<br> Just how would you start<br> to cut up a human body?<br> Jeff, I'll be honest with you.<br> You're beginning to scare me.<br> Jeff, did you hear what I said?<br> You're beginning to scare -<br> Shh! He's coming back!<br> - Jeff, if you could only see yourself!<br> - What's the matter?<br> Sitting around looking out of the<br> window to kill time is one thing,<br> but doing it the way<br> you are with binoculars<br> and wild opinions about every<br> little thing you see is diseased!<br> Do you think I consider it recreation?<br> I don't know what you consider it,<br> but if you don't stop it,<br> I'm getting out of here.<br> - What's the -<br> - What is it you're looking for?<br> I just want to find out what's<br> the matter with the salesman's wife.<br> Does that make me<br> sound like a madman?<br> What makes you think there's<br> something the matter with her?<br> A lot of things. She's an invalid.<br> She demands constant care.<br> Yet not the husband or anybody else<br> has been in to see her all day. Why?<br> - Maybe she died.<br> - Where's the doctor?<br> Where's the undertaker?<br> She could be sleeping, under sedatives.<br> He's in there now.<br> There's nothing to see.<br> There is something.<br> I've seen it through that window.<br> I've seen bickering and family quarrels<br> and mysterious trips at night<br> and knives and saws and rope.<br> Now, since last evening, not a sign<br> of the wife. Tell me where she is.<br> - I don't know.<br> - What's she doing?<br> Maybe he's leaving his wife.<br> I don't know. I don't care!<br> Lots of people have knives and saws<br> and ropes around their houses.<br> And lots of men don't speak<br> to their wives all day.<br> Lots of wives nag and<br> men hate them and trouble starts,<br> but few of them end up in murder,<br> if that's what you're thinking.<br> It's pretty hard for you to keep<br> away from that word, isn't it?<br> You could see all that he did,<br> couldn't you?<br> - Of course, I -<br> - You could see cos the shades were up<br> and he walked along the corridor<br> and the street and the backyard.<br> I've seen him -<br> Jeff, do you think a murderer<br> would let you see all that?<br> That he wouldn't pull the shades<br> down and hide behind them?<br> He's being clever. He's being nonchalant.<br> And that's<br> where you're not bring clever.<br> A murderer would never parade<br> his crime in front of an open window.<br> Why not?<br> For all you know, there's<br> something sinister going on there.<br> Where? Oh.<br> No comment.<br> Let's start<br> from the beginning again, Jeff.<br> Tell me everything you saw<br> and what you think it means.<br> - Yeah?<br> "The name on the second floor<br> rear mail box reads,<br> 'Mr and Mrs Lars'."<br> "That's L-a-r-s."<br> "Lars Thorwald."<br> What's the number of the apartment?<br> "125 West Ninth Street."<br> Thank you, dear.<br> "OK, chief.<br> What's my next assignment?"<br> Just go home.<br> "Alright, but what's he doing now?"<br> He's just sitting<br> in the living room in the dark.<br> Hasn't gone near the bedroom.<br> Now you go home<br> and get some sleep. Good night.<br> "Good night."<br> "What's it about, Jeff?"<br> Look, Doyle,<br> I can't tell you over the phone.<br> You have to be here<br> and see the whole set-up.<br> It's probably nothing.<br> It's just a little neighbourhood murder.<br> - "Did you say murder?"<br> - Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.<br> "Oh, come now."<br> My only thought was throwing a little<br> business your way, that's all.<br> I figured a detective would jump at<br> the chance of something to detect.<br> - "I'm not working."<br> - What?<br> "This happens to be my day off."<br> I usually took my best pictures<br> on my day off.<br> - "I'll drop by."<br> - OK, Doyle. As soon as you can.<br> Bless your heart, Stella.<br> Gee whiz, look at this.<br> I can't tell you<br> what a welcome sight this is.<br> No wonder your husband still loves you.<br> - The police.<br> - What?<br> - You called the police.<br> - Well, not exactly.<br> Not an official call.<br> It's an old friend of mine.<br> An old, ornery friend of mine.<br> Just where do you suppose<br> he cut her up?<br> Of course. The bathtub.<br> That's the only place where<br> he could have washed away the blood.<br> He better get that trunk out<br> of there before it starts to leak.<br> Harry?<br> Look, look, Mr Jefferies.<br> I thought Doyle would be here<br> by the time the trunk left,<br> or I'd have called the police.<br> Now we're gonna lose it.<br> - Hold everything.<br> - Don't do anything foolish.<br> I'm just gonna get the name<br> off that freight truck.<br> I'll keep an eye on the alley.<br> Long distance.<br> You didn't see the killing or the body.<br> How do you know there was a murder?<br> Because everything this fellow's done<br> has been suspicious:<br> Trips at night in the rain,<br> knives and saws and trunks with rope,<br> and now this wife<br> that isn't there any more.<br> I admit it all has a mysterious sound.<br> It could be any number of things.<br> Murder's the least possible.<br> Doyle, don't tell me<br> he's an unemployed magician,<br> amusing the neighbourhood<br> with his sleight of hand.<br> Don't tell me that.<br> It's too obvious and stupid<br> a way to commit murder.<br> In full view of 50 windows?<br> Then sit there smoking a cigar,<br> waiting for the police to pick him up.<br> Alright, officer, do your duty.<br> Go over and pick him up.<br> Jeff, you've got a lot<br> to learn about homicide.<br> Why, morons have committed<br> murder so shrewdly,<br> it's taken a hundred trained<br> police minds to catch them.<br> That salesman wouldn't just<br> knock his wife off after dinner<br> and toss her in the trunk<br> and put her in storage.<br> I'll bet it's been done.<br> Most everything's been done...<br> under panic.<br> This is a thousand-to-one shot.<br> He's still sitting around the apartment.<br> That man's not panicked.<br> You think I made all this up?<br> Well, I think you saw something<br> there's probably<br> a very simple explanation for.<br> - For instance?<br> - Wife took a trip.<br> His wife was sick in bed.<br> Yeah, so you told me.<br> Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.<br> I won't report this to the department.<br> Let me poke into it a little on my own.<br> No sense in your getting<br> a lot of ridiculous publicity.<br> Thank you.<br> We know the wife is gone,<br> so I'll see if I can find out where.<br> Do that.<br> You had any headaches lately?<br> Not till you showed up.<br> It will wear off,<br> along with the hallucinations.<br> See you around.<br> - Get along.<br> He has a six months' lease.<br> Used up a little more than<br> five and a half months of it.<br> He's quiet,<br> drinks, but not to drunkenness.<br> Pays his bills promptly<br> with money earned<br> as a costume jewellery salesman:<br> wholesale.<br> Kept to himself. No neighbours<br> got close to him or his wife.<br> Yeah, well, I think<br> they missed their chance with her.<br> She never left the apartment,<br> until yesterday morning.<br> - What time?<br> - 6:00am.<br> I think that's<br> about the time I fell asleep.<br> Too bad.<br> Thorwalds were leaving<br> their apartment at just that time.<br> Feel a little foolish?<br> No, not yet.<br> - How's your wife?<br> - Oh, she's fine.<br> Who said they left then?<br> - W-Who left where?<br> - The Thorwalds, at 6:00am.<br> Oh, the building superintendent<br> and two tenants.<br> Flat statements, no hesitation.<br> They jived with the letter.<br> Thorwalds were on their way<br> to the railroad station.<br> Well, now, Tom, how could<br> anybody possibly guess that?<br> What, did they have signs<br> on their luggage saying,<br> 'Grand Central, or bust'?<br> The superintendent<br> met Thorwald on his way back.<br> Thorwald told him that he'd put<br> his wife on a train to the country.<br> I see. I'd say this is a pretty<br> convenient guy, this superintendent.<br> Have you checked<br> his bank statements lately?<br> - Huh?<br> - Well, what good's his information?<br> It's a secondhand version of<br> an unsupported story by the murderer.<br> Now did anybody actually see<br> the wife get on the train?<br> I hate to remind you,<br> but this all started because<br> you said she was murdered.<br> Now, did anyone, including you,<br> actually see her murdered?<br> What are you doing?<br> Are you interested in solving<br> this case or making me look foolish?<br> Well, if possible, both.<br> Then do a good job of it.<br> Go over there and search<br> Thorwald's apartment.<br> It must be knee-deep in evidence.<br> I can't do that.<br> I don't mean right now,<br> but when he goes out for a drink,<br> or a paper, or something.<br> What he doesn't know won't hurt him.<br> I can't do that even if he isn't there.<br> What's he...<br> Does he have a courtesy card from<br> the police department or something?<br> Now don't get me mad.<br> Not even a detective can walk<br> into an apartment and search it.<br> If I were caught in there, they'd<br> have my badge within ten minutes.<br> Make sure<br> you don't get caught, that's all.<br> If you find something,<br> you've got a murderer,<br> and they don't care about<br> a couple of house rules.<br> If you don't find anything,<br> the fellow's clear.<br> At the risk of sounding stuffy,<br> I'd like to remind you<br> of the Constitution and the phrase,<br> 'search warrant issued by a judge '<br> who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim.<br> - He must ask for evidence.<br> - Give him evidence.<br> Yeah, I can hear myself,<br> "Your Honour, I have a friend<br> who's an amateur sleuth."<br> "The other night, after<br> having a heavy dinner, he..."<br> He'd throw the New York State<br> penal code in my face,<br> and there's six volumes.<br> By tomorrow morning there<br> may not be any evidence left<br> over in that apartment, you know that.<br> It's a detective's nightmare.<br> What do you need<br> before you can search?<br> Tell me now, what do you need?<br> Bloody footsteps<br> leading up to the door?<br> One thing I don't need is heckling.<br> You called me and asked for help.<br> Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.<br> How did we ever<br> stand each other in that plane<br> for three years during the war?<br> I guess I'll go over<br> to the railroad station<br> and check on Thorwald's story.<br> Oh, forget about the story.<br> Find the trunk. Mrs Thorwald's in it.<br> Oh, I almost forgot.<br> There was a postcard<br> in Thorwald's mailbox. It was...<br> mailed 3:30 yesterday<br> afternoon from Merritsville.<br> That's 80 miles north of here.<br> Message went: 'Arrived OK.<br> Already feeling better. Love, Anna.'<br> Uh... is that, um...<br> Anna... Is that who I think it is?<br> - Mrs Thorwald.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?<br> You might send me a good detective.<br> - Oh, by the way, where's the gin?<br> - I'll get the gin.<br> Much faster, and swing the left arm up.<br> - # Many dreams ago<br> - Try it again.<br> # I dreamed many dreams<br> # Waiting for<br> # My true love<br> # To appear<br> # Though each night<br> # It seems<br> # Someone filled<br> # My dreams<br> # Still the face that I kissed<br> # Wasn't clear<br> # So I let my heart dance<br> # Through many<br> # Sweet refrains<br> # But now<br> # Just one song<br> # And just one<br> # Dream remains<br> # That one song is you<br> # And at last<br> # I know<br> # You're the one<br> # I dreamed of<br> # Many dreams<br> # Ago<br> - "Hello? Yes?"<br> - Hello, Miss Doyle?<br> This is Jeff again.<br> Has Tom come in yet?<br> "Not yet, Jeff."<br> You mean you haven't<br> even heard from him?<br> "Not a word.<br> Is it something really important, Jeff?"<br> Yeah, I'm afraid it is.<br> "I'll have him call the moment<br> I hear from him."<br> No, no, don't bother to do that.<br> Just have him get over here<br> as soon as he can.<br> Looks like Thorwald's<br> pulling out tonight.<br> - " Who's Thorwald?"<br> - He'll know, he'll know.<br> And Thorwald's a man, don't worry.<br> - "Good night, you idiot."<br> - Good night.<br> Long distance again.<br> There's somebody at the door.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> Hello.<br> - What'd you do to your hair?<br> - Oh, I just -<br> Take a look at Thorwald.<br> He's getting ready to pull out.<br> He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.<br> He's been laying out all<br> his things on one of the beds:<br> Shirts, suits, coats, socks.<br> Even that alligator handbag<br> his wife left on the bedpost.<br> He had it hidden in the dresser.<br> At least, it was there.<br> He took it out, went to the telephone<br> and made a long distance call.<br> He had his wife's jewellery<br> in the handbag.<br> Seemed worried about it.<br> Asked someone's advice over the phone.<br> Someone not his wife.<br> Well, I never saw him<br> ask her for advice.<br> She volunteered plenty,<br> but I never saw him ask her for any.<br> - I wonder where he's going.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Suppose he doesn't come back?<br> - He'll be back. His things are there.<br> - I guess it's safe to put on lights.<br> - No, not yet!<br> OK, you can turn it on now. He must<br> have gone someplace to the right.<br> All day long, I've been trying<br> to keep my mind on my work.<br> - Thinking about Thorwald?<br> - And you, and your friend, Doyle.<br> - Did you hear from him since he left?<br> - Not a word.<br> He said he was gonna check<br> the railroad station and the trunk.<br> He must be still at it.<br> Something on your mind?<br> - It doesn't make sense to me.<br> - What doesn't?<br> Women aren't that unpredictable.<br> Hmm. Well, I can't guess<br> what you're thinking.<br> A woman has a favourite handbag,<br> and it always hangs on her bedpost<br> where she can get at it easily.<br> Then, all of a sudden, she goes away<br> on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?<br> Because she didn't know<br> she was going on a trip,<br> and where she's going,<br> she wouldn't need the handbag.<br> Yes, but only her husband<br> would know that.<br> And that jewellery - Women don't<br> keep their jewellery in a purse<br> getting all twisted<br> and scratched and tangled up.<br> Well, do they hide it<br> in their husband's clothes?<br> They do not.<br> And they don't leave it behind either.<br> Why, a woman going anywhere<br> but the hospital<br> would always take make-up,<br> perfume and jewellery.<br> Put that over there.<br> That's inside stuff, huh?<br> It's basic equipment.<br> And you don't leave it behind in<br> your husband's drawer<br> in your favourite handbag.<br> Well, I'm with you, sweetie.<br> I'm with you.<br> Tom Doyle has a pat answer<br> for that though.<br> That Mrs Thorwald left at 6:00am<br> yesterday with her husband?<br> According to those witnesses.<br> Well, I have a pat rebuttal<br> for Mr Doyle.<br> Couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald,<br> or I don't know women.<br> - What about the witnesses?<br> - We'll agree they saw a woman,<br> but she was not Mrs Thorwald.<br> - That is, not yet.<br> - Is that so?<br> Come here.<br> I'd like to see your friend's face<br> when we tell him.<br> He doesn't sound<br> like much of a detective.<br> Oh, don't be too hard on him.<br> He's a steady worker.<br> I sure wish he'd show up.<br> Don't rush him. We have all night.<br> - We have all what?<br> - Night.<br> I'm going to stay with you.<br> Well, you'll have to clear that<br> with my landlord.<br> I have the whole weekend off.<br> That's very nice,<br> but I just have one bed.<br> If you say anything else, I'll...<br> stay tomorrow night too.<br> I won't be able<br> to give you any... pyjamas.<br> You said I'll have<br> to live out of one suitcase.<br> - I'll bet yours isn't this small.<br> - This is a suitcase?<br> Well, a Mark Cross overnight case.<br> - Ooh.<br> - Compact, but, uh... ample enough.<br> Looks like you packed in a hurry.<br> Look at this. Isn't that amazing?<br> I'll trade you... my feminine intuition<br> for a bed for the night.<br> I'll go along with that.<br> There's that song again.<br> Where does a man get inspiration<br> to write a song like that?<br> Well, he gets it from<br> the landlady once a month.<br> It's utterly beautiful.<br> - I wish I could be creative.<br> - Oh, sweetie, you are.<br> Y-Y-You have a great talent for<br> creating difficult situations.<br> - I do?<br> - Sure.<br> Like staying here all night uninvited.<br> Well, surprise is the most<br> important element of attack.<br> Besides, you're not up on<br> your private eye literature.<br> When they're in trouble,<br> it's always their Girl Friday<br> that gets them out of it.<br> Is she the girl that<br> saves them from the clutches<br> of the over-passionate<br> daughters of the rich?<br> - The same.<br> - That's the one, huh?<br> It's funny. He never ends<br> up marrying her, does he?<br> - That's strange.<br> - Weird.<br> Why don't I slip into something<br> more comfortable?<br> By all means.<br> I mean, like the kitchen<br> and make us some coffee.<br> Oh, and some brandy too, huh?<br> Harry.<br> - Jeff.<br> - Hi.<br> What else have you got<br> on this man Thorwald?<br> Enough to scare me you wouldn't<br> show up in time and we'd lose him.<br> - Think he's getting out of here?<br> - He's got everything he owns<br> Iaid out over there in the bedroom,<br> waiting to be packed.<br> I'm just warming some brandy.<br> Mr Doyle, I presume?<br> Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.<br> - How do you do?<br> - We think Thorwald's guilty.<br> Careful, Tom.<br> - Hello.<br> - Lieutenant Doyle.<br> Yeah, he's right here. For you.<br> - Hello.<br> - Lieutenant Doyle, sir?<br> Speaking. Yeah.<br> Alright.<br> I see. Thank you... Goodbye.<br> Coffee will be ready soon.<br> Jeff, aren't you going to tell him<br> about the jewellery?<br> Jewellery?<br> He's got his wife's jewellery hidden<br> in his clothes in the bedroom there.<br> - You sure it belonged to his wife?<br> - It was in her favourite handbag.<br> Mr Doyle, that can only lead<br> to one conclusion.<br> Namely?<br> That it was not Mrs Thorwald that<br> left with him yesterday morning.<br> You figured that out, eh?<br> It's simply that women<br> don't leave their jewellery behind<br> when they go on a trip.<br> Come on, Tom. You don't really need<br> any of this information, do you?<br> As a matter of fact, I don't.<br> Lars Thorwald is no more<br> a murderer than I am.<br> You can explain everything<br> that's going on over there?<br> - No, and neither can you.<br> That's a secret, private world<br> you're looking into out there.<br> People do a lot of things in private<br> they couldn't do in public.<br> Like disposing of their wives?<br> Get that idea out of your mind.<br> It'll only lead in the wrong direction.<br> What about the knife and the saw?<br> - Did you ever own a saw?<br> - Well, at home in the garage I had -<br> How many people<br> did you cut up with it?<br> Or with the couple hundred knives<br> you've owned in your lifetime?<br> Your logic is backward.<br> You can't ignore the disappearance<br> and the trunk and the jewellery.<br> I checked the railroad station.<br> He bought a ticket.<br> Ten minutes later,<br> he put his wife on the train.<br> Destination: Merritsville.<br> The witnesses are that deep.<br> That might have been a woman, but<br> it couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald.<br> - That jewellery -<br> - Look, Miss Fremont.<br> That feminine intuition stuff<br> sells magazines<br> but in real life, it's still a fairy tale.<br> I don't know how many<br> wasted years I've spent,<br> tracking down leads<br> based on female intuition.<br> Alright!<br> I take it you didn't find the trunk.<br> All this is from an old speech<br> you made at the policemen's ball.<br> I found the trunk<br> a half-hour after I left here.<br> I suppose it's normal for a man<br> to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?<br> If the lock is broken, yes.<br> What did you find inside the trunk,<br> a surly note to me?<br> Mrs Thorwald's clothes;<br> clean, well-packed,<br> not stylish, but presentable.<br> Didn't you take them off<br> to the crime lab?<br> I sent them on their merry<br> and legal way.<br> Why, when a woman is taking<br> a simple, short trip,<br> does she take everything she owns?<br> Let's let the female psychology<br> department handle that one.<br> I would say it looked as if<br> she wasn't coming back.<br> That's what's<br> known as a family problem.<br> If she wasn't coming back,<br> why didn't he tell his landlord?<br> I'll tell you why<br> he didn't tell his landlord,<br> because he was hiding something.<br> Do you tell your landlord everything?<br> Ah, I told you to be careful, Tom.<br> If I'd have been careful<br> piloting that reconnaissance plane<br> you wouldn't have had the chance<br> to take the pictures<br> that won you a medal,<br> and a good job, and fame, and money.<br> What do you say, we all sit<br> down and have a nice friendly drink.<br> Forget all about this.<br> We can tell lies about<br> the good old days during the war.<br> You mean<br> you're through with the case?<br> There is no case<br> to be through with, Miss Fremont.<br> How about that drink?<br> Yeah, I guess you're right.<br> Well, I think I better get home<br> and get some sleep.<br> Cheers.<br> I, uh... I'm not much of a snifter.<br> Oh, Jeff, if you need any more help...<br> consult the Yellow Pages<br> in your telephone directory.<br> Oh, I love funny exiting lines.<br> - Who was that trunk addressed to?<br> - Mrs Anna Thorwald.<br> Then let's wait and find out<br> who picks it up.<br> Oh, that phone call,<br> I gave them your number.<br> - I hope you don't mind.<br> - Depends on who they were.<br> The police at Merritsville.<br> They reported<br> the trunk was just picked up...<br> by Mrs Anna Thorwald.<br> Don't stay up too late.<br> - Look.<br> - What?<br> Yeah, he's kind of young, isn't he?<br> What are you doing?<br> # Or just a cold and lonely<br> # Lovely work of art #<br> You know, much as I hate to give<br> Thomas J Doyle too much credit,<br> he might have gotten ahold<br> of something when he said<br> that was pretty private<br> stuff going on out there.<br> I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man<br> with binoculars and a long-focus lens.<br> Do you...<br> Do you suppose it's ethical, even if you<br> prove that he didn't commit a crime?<br> I'm not much on rear window ethics.<br> Of course,<br> they can do the same thing to me,<br> watch me like a bug under a glass,<br> if they want to.<br> Jeff, if someone came in here,<br> they wouldn't believe what they'd see.<br> - What?<br> - You and me with long faces,<br> plunged into despair because<br> we find out a man didn't kill his wife.<br> We're two of the most<br> frightening ghouls I've ever known.<br> You'd think we could be a bit happy<br> that the poor woman is alive and well.<br> Whatever happened to that old<br> saying, 'Love thy neighbour'?<br> You know, I think I'll start<br> reviving that tomorrow.<br> Yeah, I'll begin with Miss Torso.<br> Not if I have to move into<br> an apartment across the way...<br> and do the 'Dance of the Seven Veils'<br> every hour.<br> Show's over for tonight.<br> Preview of coming attractions.<br> Did Mr Doyle think I stole this case?<br> No, Lisa, I don't think he did.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Well, uh...<br> - I will rephrase the question.<br> - Thank you.<br> Do you like it?<br> - Yes, I like it.<br> - Well -<br> What's the matter?<br> - Somebody's hurt?<br> - It's the dog.<br> Something's happened to the dog.<br> Somebody fall out a window?<br> I think it's a dog.<br> It's dead. It's been strangled.<br> Its neck is broken.<br> Which one of you did it?<br> Which one of you killed my dog?<br> You don't know the meaning<br> of the word 'neighbours'.<br> Neighbours like each other,<br> speak to each other,<br> care if anybody lives or dies!<br> But none of you do!<br> But I couldn't imagine<br> any of you being so low<br> that you'd kill a helpless, friendly dog.<br> The only thing in this whole<br> neighbourhood who liked anybody!<br> Did you kill him because he liked you?<br> Just because he liked you?<br> Let's go inside.<br> - Come on. Let's go back in.<br> - It's only a dog.<br> You know, for a minute,<br> that Tom Doyle almost had me<br> convinced I was wrong.<br> - But you're not?<br> - Look.<br> In the courtyard, only one person<br> didn't come to the window. Look.<br> Why would Thorwald<br> want to kill a little dog?<br> Because it knew too much?<br> You think this is worth<br> waiting all day to see?<br> ls he cleaning house?<br> He's washing down the bathroom walls.<br> Hm, must have splattered a lot.<br> Well, why not?<br> That's what we're all thinking.<br> He killed her in there,<br> he has to clean up those stains.<br> Oh, Stella, your choice of words.<br> Nobody ever invented<br> a polite word for a killing yet.<br> Lisa, back there on that shelf,<br> there's a little yellow box, you see it?<br> - Top one?<br> - Right on top, yeah.<br> And bring me the viewer there.<br> I just got a...<br> These are about two weeks old.<br> I hope I took something else<br> besides leg art. Now which one...<br> What are you looking for?<br> There's something, and if I'm right,<br> I think I've solved a murder.<br> - Mrs Thorwald?<br> - No.<br> No, the dog.<br> Uh-huh. I think I know<br> why Thorwald killed that dog.<br> Here, now you take a look.<br> Tell me what you see.<br> Now take it down.<br> Now look again.<br> Now take it down. You see?<br> It's just a picture of the backyard -<br> But with one important change.<br> One important change.<br> Those flowers<br> in Thorwald's pet flower bed.<br> You mean where the dog<br> was sniffing around?<br> Where the dog was digging.<br> Now look at those flowers.<br> Look, those two yellow zinnias<br> on this end<br> aren't as tall as they were.<br> Since when do flowers<br> grow shorter in two weeks?<br> - There's something buried there.<br> - Mrs Thorwald.<br> You haven't spent much time<br> around cemeteries, have you?<br> Mr Thorwald could scarcely<br> put his wife's body<br> in a plot of ground<br> about one foot square.<br> Unless, of course,<br> he put her in standing on end,<br> and then he wouldn't need<br> a knife and saw.<br> No, my idea is she's<br> scattered all over town.<br> - Leg in the East River -<br> - Oh, Stella, please!<br> No, no, no. There's something in there.<br> Those flowers have been<br> taken out and put back in.<br> - Maybe it's the knife and saw.<br> - Yeah -<br> - Call Lieutenant Doyle.<br> - No, let's wait.<br> Let's wait till it gets a little darker,<br> and I'll go over there and dig them up.<br> You'll go? You won't dig anything up<br> and get your neck broken.<br> No, no, we've...<br> We're not gonna call Doyle until<br> I can produce Mrs Thorwald's body.<br> What we've got to do is find a way<br> to get into that apartment.<br> He's packing.<br> Uh-oh.<br> Here, get me a pencil.<br> Stella, get me some note paper.<br> It's up here someplace.<br> There it is.<br> You did it, Thorwald. You did it.<br> - Look out, Lisa. He's coming.<br> - You never should have let her do it.<br> - If he ever -<br> - Look. Look. Look.<br> Thank heaven that's over.<br> - Alright if I have a drink?<br> - Sure, go ahead.<br> There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.<br> It's just a question of when.<br> Mind if I use that portable keyhole?<br> Go ahead, just as long as you tell me<br> what you're looking at.<br> - I wonder...<br> - Wonder what?<br> Miss Lonelyhearts just laid out<br> something that looks like<br> rhodium tri-eckonal capsules.<br> - You can tell from here ?<br> - I've handled enough of those<br> to put everybody in Hackensack<br> to sleep for the winter.<br> - Does she have enough of them to -<br> - To make her rest easier -<br> - Wasn't that close?<br> What was his reaction<br> when he looked at the note?<br> It wasn't the kind<br> of expression that would get him<br> a quick loan at the bank.<br> Jeff, the handbag!<br> Suppose Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring<br> is among the jewellery<br> he has in that handbag?<br> Now, during the phone conversation<br> he held up three rings:<br> one with a diamond,<br> one with a big stone of some sort,<br> and then just a plain gold band.<br> The last thing she would leave behind<br> would be her wedding ring.<br> Stella,<br> do you ever leave yours at home?<br> The only way anybody could get that<br> ring would be to chop off my finger.<br> Let's go down and find out<br> what's buried in the garden.<br> Why not? I've always wanted<br> to meet Mrs Thorwald.<br> - What are you two talking about -<br> - You got a shovel?<br> Of course I don't have a shovel.<br> - There's probably one in the basement.<br> - If you're squeamish, just don't look.<br> Squeamish? I'm not squeamish.<br> I just don't want you two<br> to end up like that dog.<br> Oh, you know, Miss Fremont,<br> he might just have something there.<br> Just hold on. Here, take this.<br> No sense taking any chances<br> in this thing.<br> Here, give me the phone book.<br> What for?<br> Maybe I can<br> get him out of that apartment.<br> We only need a few minutes.<br> I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.<br> - How?<br> - Thorwald.<br> Thorwald... Thorwald.<br> Chelsea 2-7099.<br> We scared him once,<br> maybe we can scare him again.<br> I guess I'm using that word<br> 'we' a little freely.<br> You're taking all the chances.<br> - Shall we vote him in, Stella ?<br> - Unanimously.<br> Chelsea.<br> Chelsea.<br> Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.<br> Go on, you're curious.<br> You wonder if it's your girlfriend<br> calling, the one you killed for.<br> Go on, pick it up.<br> - "Hello?"<br> - Did you get my note?<br> Well, did you get it, Thorwald?<br> "Who are you?"<br> I'll give you a chance to find out.<br> Meet me<br> in the bar at the Albert Hotel.<br> Do it right away.<br> - "Why should l?"<br> - A little business meeting...<br> to settle the estate of your late wife.<br> "I... don't know what you mean."<br> Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald,<br> or I'll hang up and call the police.<br> - "I only have $100."<br> - That's a start.<br> I'm at the Albert now.<br> I'll be looking for you.<br> Come on, Stella, let's go.<br> One of you<br> keep an eye on this window.<br> If I see him coming back,<br> I'll signal with a flashbulb.<br> "This is the Doyle residence."<br> Hello, this is L B Jefferies.<br> I'm a friend of Mr Doyle.<br> - Who's this?<br> - "This is a baby-sitter."<br> Oh, uh... when do you expect them in?<br> "They went to dinner and<br> maybe a nightclub."<br> I see, hm.<br> If he calls in, have him get<br> in touch with L B Jefferies?<br> I might have quite a surprise for him.<br> "Well, do we have<br> your number, Mr Jefferies?"<br> - He has it. Good night.<br> - "Good night."<br> Ah, Stella was wrong<br> about Miss Lonelyhearts.<br> Lisa, what are you... Don't...<br> Don't...<br> Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...<br> Li...<br> Come on, come on!<br> Get out of there!<br> She said ring Thorwald's phone<br> the second you see him come back.<br> We'll ring right now!<br> Give her another minute.<br> Alright, fellows,<br> let's try it once from the beginning.<br> Miss Lonelyhearts.<br> Oh, call the police!<br> - "Operator."<br> - Get me the police, sixth precinct.<br> "Yes, sir."<br> Mr Jefferies, the music stopped her.<br> What... Lisa!<br> Lisa!<br> "Precinct Six, Sergeant Allgood."<br> Hello. Look, a man is assaulting<br> a woman at 125 West Ninth Street,<br> second floor, at the rear.<br> Make it fast!<br> - "Your name?"<br> - L B Jefferies.<br> - "Phone number?"<br> - Chelsea 2-5598<br> "Two minutes."<br> The door was open.<br> Oh...<br> - I told you...<br> - Oh, no!<br> Let go of me! Jeff!<br> - Oh, no! - Jeff! Jeff!<br> Jeff!<br> Lisa!<br> Stella, what do we do?<br> - Jeff! Jeff!<br> - Here they come.<br> What's she trying to do?<br> Why doesn't she turn him in?<br> - She's a smart girl.<br> - "Smart girl?" She'll be arrested.<br> It'll get her out of there, won't it?<br> Look, the wedding ring!<br> Turn off the light! He's seen us!<br> How long do you think he'll stay there?<br> Unless he's dumber than I think,<br> he won't wait until his lease is up.<br> Get my billfold out of the drawer<br> in the table there.<br> - What do you need money for?<br> - I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.<br> You could leave her there<br> till next Tuesday.<br> Then you could sneak<br> safely away as planned.<br> - Yeah, let's see, $127.<br> - How much do you need?<br> Well, this is first offence burglary,<br> that's about $250.<br> - Lisa's handbag.<br> - Yeah.<br> - How much does she have?<br> - Fifty cents.<br> - Here, take this.<br> - I got $20 or so in my purse.<br> What about the rest?<br> When those cops see Lisa,<br> they'll even contribute.<br> Just a minute. Hurry up!<br> - Jefferies.<br> - "What is it now?"<br> Doyle, I've got something<br> really big for you.<br> "Why did I have to return your call?"<br> "Look! Don't louse up my night<br> with another mad killer -"<br> Listen to me! Listen to me!<br> Lisa's in jail. She got arrested.<br> - "Your Lisa?"<br> - My Lisa.<br> Boy, you should have seen her.<br> She got into Thorwald's apartment,<br> but then he came back<br> and the only way I could get her out,<br> was call the police.<br> - "I told you -"<br> - I know you told me.<br> She went in to get evidence,<br> and she came out with evidence.<br> - "Like what?"<br> - Like Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring.<br> If that woman was alive,<br> she'd be wearing that ring, right?<br> - "Hm. It's a possibility."<br> - A 'possibility'? It's a fact.<br> He killed a dog last night<br> because the dog was scratching around<br> in the garden. You know why?<br> Because he had something buried<br> in that garden that the dog scented.<br> "Like an old ham bone?"<br> I don't know what pet names<br> Thorwald had for his wife,<br> but I'll tell you this:<br> All those trips at night<br> with that metal suitcase,<br> he wasn't taking out his possessions,<br> because his possessions<br> are still up in the apartment.<br> Do you think perhaps<br> it was old 'ham bone?'<br> And I'll tell you something else.<br> All the telephone calls<br> he made were long distance, alright?<br> Now, if he called his wife long<br> distance on the day she left,<br> after she arrived in Merritsville,<br> why did she write a card to him<br> saying she arrived in Merritsville?<br> Why did she do that?<br> - "Where'd they take Lisa?"<br> - Precinct six.<br> I sent somebody over<br> with the bail money.<br> "Maybe you won't need it.<br> I'll run it down, Jeff."<br> Alright. Hurry up, will you?<br> This fellow knows he's being watched.<br> He's not gonna wait around forever.<br> Hurry up.<br> "If that ring checks out,<br> we'll give him an escort. So long, Jeff."<br> - So long.<br> Hello, Tom.<br> I think Thorwald's left. I don't see...<br> Hello?<br> What do you want from me?<br> Your friend, the girl, could have<br> turned me in. Why didn't she?<br> What is it you want, a lot of money?<br> I don't have any money.<br> Say something.<br> Say something! Tell me what you want!<br> Can you get me that ring back?<br> - No.<br> - Tell her to bring it back.<br> I can't. The police have it by now.<br> Lisa! Doyle!<br> What was that?<br> Look! Look over at that apartment!<br> They're fighting!<br> Look, he's throwing him<br> out the window!<br> Doyle!<br> Creele, give me your .38!<br> I'm sorry, Jeff.<br> I got here as fast as I could.<br> Don't let anybody touch him.<br> Get me a medical bag from upstairs.<br> Lisa, sweetie, if anything<br> had happened to you -<br> - I'm alright.<br> - Gee, I'm proud of you.<br> You got enough<br> for a search warrant now?<br> Oh, yeah, sure.<br> - Lieutenant Doyle.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Is he OK?<br> - He's alive.<br> Thorwald's ready to take us<br> on a tour of the East River.<br> Did he say what was buried<br> in the flower bed?<br> Yeah. He said the dog got<br> too inquisitive, so he dug it up.<br> It's in a hat box over in his apartment.<br> - Want to look?<br> - No, thanks.<br> I don't want any part of her.<br> I hope it's gonna be a hit.<br> This is the first release.<br> I'd love to hear it.<br> I can't tell you what<br> this music has meant to me.<br> # Record Playing<br> Oh, sweet little puppy.<br> Don't jump. Let's try it again, puppy.<br> Stay still. Stay.<br> - Stanley!<br> - Hello, baby.<br> My, look what<br> the army's done for you!<br> The army's made me hungry.<br> What have you got<br> in the icebox to eat?<br> Boy, it's good to be home.<br> If you had told me you'd quit your job,<br> we wouldn't have gotten married.<br> Oh, honey. Come on.<br> # But dream<br> # Forever<br> # ln your arms<br> # Oh, Lisa<br> # Lisa #<br>
