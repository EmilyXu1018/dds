                        Last night<br> I dreamt I went to Manderley again.<br> It seemed to me I stood by the<br> iron gate leading to the drive,<br> and for a while<br> I could not enter...<br> for the way was barred to me.<br> Then, like all dreamers,<br> I was possessed of a sudden<br> with supernatural powers...<br> and passed like a spirit<br> through the barrier before me.<br> The drive wound away<br> in front of me,<br> twisting and turning<br> as it had always done.<br> But as I advanced, I was aware<br> that a change had come upon it.<br> Nature had come<br> into her own again,<br> and little by little<br> had encroached upon the drive...<br> with long, tenacious fingers.<br> On and on wound the poor thread<br> that had once been our drive,<br> and finally<br> there was Manderley.<br> Manderley...<br> secretive and silent.<br> Time could not mar the perfect<br> symmetry of those walls.<br> Moonlight can play<br> odd tricks upon the fancy,<br> and suddenly it seemed to me that light<br> came from the windows.<br> And then a cloud<br> came upon the moon...<br> and hovered an instant<br> like a dark hand before a face.<br> The illusion went with it.<br> I looked upon<br> a desolate shell...<br> with no whisper of the past<br> about its staring walls.<br> We can never<br> go back to Manderley again.<br> That much is certain.<br> But sometimes in my dreams...<br> I do go back to the strange<br> days of my life...<br> which began for me<br> in the South of France.<br> No! Stop!<br> What the devil<br> are you shouting about?<br> Who are you?<br> What are you staring at?<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.<br> But I, I only thought...<br> Oh, you did, did you?<br> Well, what are you doing here?<br> I was only walking.<br> Well, get on with your walking.<br> Don't hang about here screaming.<br> I'll never come to Monte Carlo<br> out of season again.<br> Not a single well-known<br> personality in the hotel.<br> Stone cold! Waiter.<br> Garcon. Call him.<br> Tell him to get me some...<br> Why, it's Max de Winter.<br> How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - I'm Edith Van Hopper.<br> It's so nice<br> to run into you here,<br> just when I was beginning to despair of<br> finding any old friends here in Monte.<br> But do sit down<br> and have some coffee.<br> Mr. De Winter is having coffee with me.<br> Ask that stupid waiter for another cup.<br> I'm afraid I must contradict you.<br> You shall both have coffee with me.<br> - Garcon. Coffee, please.<br> - Oui, monsieur.<br> - A cigarette?<br> - No, thank you.<br> You know, I recognized you<br> just as soon as you came in,<br> though I haven't seen you since<br> that night at the casino at Palm Beach.<br> Perhaps you don't remember<br> an old woman like me.<br> Are you playing the tables much here?<br> No, I'm afraid that sort of thing<br> ceased to amuse me years ago.<br> I can well understand that.<br> As for me,<br> if I had a home like Manderley,<br> I should certainly never come to Monte.<br> It's one of the biggest places<br> in that part of the country, and<br> you can't beat it for beauty.<br> What do you think of Monte Carlo?<br> Or don't you think of it at all?<br> Oh, well,<br> I think it's rather artificial.<br> She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter.<br> That's her trouble.<br> Most giris would give their eyes<br> for a chance to see Monte.<br> Wouldn't that rather<br> defeat the purpose?<br> Now that we've found each other again,<br> I hope I shall see something of you.<br> You must come<br> and have a drink in my suite.<br> I hope they've given you a good room.<br> The place is empty. So if you're<br> uncomfortable, mind you, make a fuss.<br> Your valet has unpacked for you,<br> I suppose?<br> I'm afraid I don't possess one.<br> Perhaps you'd like to do it for me?<br> Well, I, I hardly think...<br> Perhaps you could make<br> yourself useful to Mr. De Winter<br> if he wants anything done.<br> You're a capable child in many ways.<br> That's a charming suggestion,<br> but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto:<br> "He travels fastest<br> who travels alone."<br> Perhaps you've not heard of it.<br> Good night.<br> What do you make of that?<br> Do you suppose that sudden departure<br> was intended to be funny?<br> Come, don't sit there gawking.<br> Let's go upstairs.<br> - Have you got the key?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.<br> I remember when I was younger<br> there was a well-known writer...<br> who used to dart down the back<br> way whenever he saw me coming.<br> I suppose he was in love with me<br> and wasn't quite sure of himself.<br> Well, c'est la vie.<br> By the way, my dear,<br> don't think that I mean to be unkind,<br> but you were just a teeny, weeny bit<br> forward with Mr. De Winter.<br> Your effort to enter<br> the conversation...<br> quite embarrassed me,<br> and I'm sure it did him.<br> Men loathe that sort of thing.<br> Oh, come. Don't sulk.<br> After all, I am responsible<br> for your behavior here.<br> Perhaps he didn't notice it.<br> Poor thing!<br> I suppose he just can't<br> get over his wife's death.<br> They say he simply adored her.<br> Oui.<br> Oh! How awkward of me.<br> What a stupid thing to do.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> Please don't bother.<br> It doesn't really matter.<br> Leave that. Leave that.<br> Go and lay another place at my table.<br> - Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.<br> - Oh, but I couldn't possibly.<br> - Why not?<br> - Oh, please don't be polite.<br> It's very kind of you,<br> - but I'll be all right if<br> they just change the cloth.<br> - I wasn't being polite.<br> I should have asked you to have<br> lunch with me even if you hadn't<br> upset the vase so clumsily.<br> Come along. We needn't talk to<br> each other if we don't feel like it.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Oh, I'll just ha-have<br> s- some scrambled eggs.<br> Oui, mademoiselle.<br> What's happened to your friend?<br> Oh, she's ill in bed with a cold.<br> I'm sorry<br> I was so rude to you yesterday.<br> The only excuse I can offer is that I've<br> become boorish through living alone.<br> You weren't really.<br> You simply wanted to be alone, and...<br> Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper<br> a friend of yours or just a relation?<br> No, she's my employer.<br> I'm what is known as a paid companion.<br> I didn't know companionship<br> could be bought.<br> I looked up the word "companion"<br> in the dictionary once.<br> It said,<br> "a friend of the bosom."<br> I don't envy you the privilege.<br> Oh, she's very kind, really,<br> and I have to earn my living.<br> - Haven't you any family?<br> - No, my mother died years and years ago,<br> and then there was only my father.<br> And he died last summer,<br> and then I took this job.<br> - How rotten for you.<br> - Yes, it was rather,<br> because, you see,<br> we got on so well together.<br> You and your father?<br> Yes. He was a lovely person...<br> very unusual.<br> - What was he?<br> - A painter.<br> - Ah. Was he a good one?<br> - Well, I thought so.<br> But people didn't understand him.<br> Yes, that's often the trouble.<br> He painted trees.<br> At least it was one tree.<br> You mean he painted the same<br> tree over and over again?<br> Yes. You see, he had a theory that<br> if you should find one perfect thing...<br> or place or person,<br> you should stick to it.<br> Do you think that's very silly?<br> Not at all.<br> I'm a firm believer in that myself.<br> And what did you find<br> to do with yourself<br> while he was painting his tree?<br> Oh, I sat with him and I sketched<br> a little. I don't do it well, though.<br> - You're going sketching this afternoon?<br> - Yes.<br> - Where?<br> - I haven't made up my mind.<br> - I'll drive you somewhere in the car.<br> - Oh, no, please. I didn't mean...<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> Finish up that mess and we'll get along.<br> Thank you. It's very kind of you,<br> but I'm not very hungry.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Eat it up like a good girl.<br> You're taking<br> long enough for that sketch.<br> I expect a really fine work of art.<br> Oh, no, don't look at it.<br> It's not nearly good enough.<br> But it can't be<br> as bad as all that.<br> Now, don't rub it all out.<br> Let me look at it first.<br> - It's the perspective.<br> I never can get it right.<br> - Let me see.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Tell me, is it the perspective...<br> that gives my nose that<br> curious twist in the middle?<br> - Well, you're not<br> a very easy subject to sketch.<br> - No?<br> - Your expression<br> keeps changing all the time.<br> - Does it?<br> Well, I'd concentrate on the view<br> instead if I were you.<br> Much more worthwhile.<br> It rather reminds me of our coastline<br> at home. Do you know Cornwall at all?<br> Yes. I went there once<br> with my father on holiday.<br> I was in a shop once,<br> and I saw a postcard...<br> with a beautiful house on it,<br> right by the sea.<br> And I asked whose house it was, and<br> the old lady said, "That's Manderley."<br> - I felt ashamed for not knowing.<br> - Manderley is beautiful.<br> To me, it's just the place<br> where I was born...<br> and have lived in all my life.<br> But now, I don't suppose<br> I shall ever see it again.<br> We're lucky not to be home<br> during the bad weather, aren't we?<br> Hmm.<br> I can't ever remember enjoying swimming<br> in England untilJune, can you?<br> The water's so warm here<br> that I could stay in all day.<br> There's a dangerous undertow, and<br> there was a man drowned here last year.<br> I never have any fear<br> of drowning, have you?<br> Come, I'll take you home.<br> Oh, yes. I know Mr. De Winter well.<br> I knew his wife too.<br> Before she married, she was the<br> beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.<br> She was drowned, poor dear,<br> while she was sailing near Manderley.<br> He never talks about it,<br> of course, but he's a broken man.<br> I suppose I'd better have it.<br> Wretched stuff!<br> Give me a chocolate, quick!<br> Oh, there you are.<br> It's about time.<br> Hurry up.<br> I want to play some rummy.<br> She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth,<br> you know.<br> They say he simply adored her.<br> She was the beautiful<br> Rebecca Hildreth, you know.<br> I suppose he just can't<br> get over his wife's death.<br> She was the beautiful<br> Rebecca Hildreth, you know.<br> But he's a broken man.<br> - Bonjour.<br> - Well, where are you going?<br> - Oh, I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.<br> - I see.<br> I suppose you've had a look at the pro,<br> and he's desperately handsome...<br> and you've conceived<br> a schoolgirl crush on him.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> Make the most of it.<br> - Off duty?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Mrs. Van Hopper's cold has turned<br> into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.<br> - I'm sorry for the nurse.<br> You keen on tennis?<br> - No, not particularly.<br> That's good.<br> We'll go for a drive.<br> Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.<br> How are you feeling?<br> You got on rather well with him,<br> didn't you?<br> That pro must have been<br> teaching you other things than tennis.<br> Hurry up.<br> I want you to make some calls.<br> I wonder if Mr. De Winter<br> is still in the hotel.<br> May I go now?<br> For the number of lessons you've had,<br> you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.<br> But this will be your last,<br> so make the most of it.<br> The trouble is, with me laid up<br> like this, you haven't had enough to do.<br> But I'm getting rid of that nurse today,<br> and from now on<br> you'll stick to your job.<br> Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.<br> - Nurse!<br> - Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper?<br> Are you absolutely sure you left<br> those messages for Mr. De Winter?<br> - Why, yes, madame.<br> - I simply can't believe it.<br> He would most certainly<br> have called me back.<br> Oh, well. Poor boy.<br> I simply hate to see him so alone.<br> You know, I, I wish there<br> could be an invention...<br> that bottled up the memory<br> like perfume.<br> And it never faded,<br> never got stale.<br> Then whenever I wanted to,<br> I could uncork the bottle...<br> and live the memory<br> all over again.<br> And what particular moment<br> would you want to keep?<br> Oh, all of them,<br> all these last few days.<br> I feel as though I'd, I'd collected<br> a whole shelf full of bottles.<br> Sometimes, you know, those<br> little bottles contain demons...<br> that have a way<br> of popping out at you...<br> just as you're trying<br> most desperately to forget.<br> Stop biting your nails.<br> Oh, I wish I were a woman of 36,<br> dressed in black satin,<br> with a string of pearis.<br> You wouldn't be here<br> with me if you were.<br> Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter,<br> why you asked me to come out with you?<br> Oh, it's obvious<br> that you want to be kind,<br> but why do you choose me<br> for your charity?<br> I asked you to come out with me<br> because I wanted your company.<br> You've blotted out<br> the past for me more...<br> than all the bright<br> lights of Monte Carlo.<br> But if you think I just asked<br> you out of kindness or charity,<br> you can leave the car now<br> and find your own way home.<br> Go on, open the door and get out.<br> Better blow your nose.<br> Please don't call me Mr. De Winter.<br> I have a very impressive<br> array of first names.<br> George Fortescue Maximilian. But you<br> needn't bother with them all at once.<br> My family call me Maxim.<br> And another thing.<br> Please promise me never<br> to wear black satin or pearis...<br> or to be 36 years old.<br> Yes, Maxim.<br> For the love of Pete! Come here!<br> What do you think?<br> My daughter's engaged to be married.<br> - Oh, really? How nice.<br> - We must leave for New York at once.<br> Get reservations<br> on the Aquitania, and we'll take<br> the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.<br> Hurry up and get a maid to help with<br> the packing. We've no time to waste.<br> Go on and don't dawdle!<br> Mr. De Winter, please.<br> Oh, he's gone out riding?<br> He won't be back till noon?<br> Oh... well...<br> give me the porter, please.<br> I'll go and see if there's<br> anything left in my room.<br> Has Mr. De Winter come in yet?<br> Oh, he has?<br> Would you connect me, please?<br> Oh, I-I was looking for my book.<br> I- I suppose I've packed it.<br> Well, come on.<br> The car's waiting at the door.<br> I'd like to leave a forwarding address<br> if they happen to find that book.<br> Would you ring<br> Mr. De Winter, please?<br> Yes, madam.<br> Cent vingt-deux.<br> There isn't any answer.<br> Thank you.<br> - Tell her to hurry up!<br> - Yes, madam.<br> I was looking for Mr. De Winter.<br> Mr. De Winter just ordered<br> breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.<br> Come in.<br> Hello. What are you doing here?<br> Anything the matter?<br> I've come to say good-bye.<br> We're going away.<br> - What on earth are you talking about?<br> - It's true.<br> We're going now, and<br> I was afraid I wouldn't see you again.<br> Where is she taking you to?<br> New York. I don't want to go.<br> I shall hate it.<br> I shall be miserable.<br> I'll dress in here.<br> I shan't be long<br> Which would you prefer,<br> New York or Manderley?<br> Oh, please don't joke about it.<br> Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting...<br> and I-I'd better say good-bye now.<br> I repeat what I said.<br> Either you go to America<br> with Mrs. Van Hopper,<br> or you come home<br> to Manderley with me.<br> You mean you want<br> a secretary or something?<br> I'm asking you to marry me,<br> you little fool.<br> Come in.<br> Is that my food? I'm famished.<br> I didn't have any breakfast.<br> Ah, my suggestion didn't seem<br> to go at all well. I'm sorry.<br> Oh, but you don't understand. It's that<br> I'm not the sort of person men marry.<br> What on earth do you mean?<br> I don't belong in your<br> sort of worid, for one thing.<br> What is my sort of worid?<br> Oh, well, Manderley.<br> You know what I mean.<br> Well, I'm the best judge<br> of whether you belong there or not.<br> Of course, if you don't love me,<br> then it's a different thing.<br> Fine blow to my conceit,<br> that's all.<br> Oh, I do love you.<br> I love you most dreadfully.<br> I've been crying all morning because<br> I thought I'd never see you again.<br> Bless you for that.<br> I'll remind you of this one day,<br> and you won't believe me.<br> It's a pity you have to grow up.<br> Well, now that's settled,<br> you may pour me out some coffee.<br> Two lumps of sugar<br> and some milk, please.<br> Same with my tea.<br> Don't forget.<br> Who's going to break the news<br> to Mrs. Van Hopper?<br> Oh, you tell her.<br> She'll be so angry.<br> What's the number of her room?<br> Oh, she's not there.<br> She's downstairs in the car.<br> Hello. Give me the desk, please.<br> Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper<br> waiting outside in her car.<br> Would you ask her,<br> with my compliments,<br> if she'd very kindly come up<br> and see me in my room?<br> Yes, in my room.<br> Mr. De Winter says please<br> for you to come up to his room.<br> Mr. De Winter?<br> Why, certainly.<br> This isn't at all<br> your idea of a proposal, is it?<br> It should be in a conservatory,<br> you in a white frock<br> with a red rose in your hand...<br> and a violin playing in the distance,<br> and I should be making violent<br> love to you behind a palm tree.<br> Poor darling. Never mind.<br> Oh, I don't mind.<br> Don't worry. Don't worry.<br> You won't have to say a word.<br> I'm so glad you called me,<br> Mr. De Winter.<br> I was making a hasty departure. It<br> was so rude of me not to let you know.<br> But a cable came<br> this morning announcing...<br> that my daughter<br> is engaged to be married.<br> That's rather a coincidence,<br> Mrs. Van Hopper.<br> I asked you up here in order<br> to tell you of my engagement.<br> You don't mean it!<br> Oh, how perfectly wonderful!<br> How romantic.<br> Who is the lucky lady?<br> I apologize for depriving you<br> of your companion in this abrupt way.<br> I do hope it won't<br> inconvenience you too greatly.<br> When did all this happen?<br> Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.<br> Just a few minutes ago.<br> I simply can't believe it.<br> I suppose I ought<br> to scold you for not...<br> having breathed a word<br> of all this to me.<br> What am I thinking of?<br> I shall give you both my<br> congratulations and blessings.<br> I'm very happy for you both.<br> When and where is the wedding to be?<br> - Here, as soon as possible.<br> - A whirlwind romance!<br> Splendid! I could easily<br> postpone my sailing for a week.<br> This poor child has no mother,<br> so I shall take responsibility<br> for all the arrangements...<br> trousseau, reception and everything.<br> And I'll give the bride away.<br> But our luggage.<br> - Go down and tell the porter to<br> take everything out of the car.<br> - Just a minute.<br> We're most grateful,<br> but I think we'd both...<br> prefer to have it<br> as quiet as possible.<br> - I couldn't possibly allow you<br> to change your sailing plans.<br> - Oh, but...<br> No, no, no. Dear, I'll go down and<br> see that your luggage is brought back.<br> Thank you, Maxim.<br> So this is what's been happening<br> during my illness.<br> Tennis lessons, my foot!<br> I suppose I have to hand it<br> to you for a fast worker.<br> How did you manage it?<br> Still waters certainly run deep.<br> Tell me, have you been doing<br> anything you shouldn't?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> Oh, well, never mind. I always did say<br> that Englishmen have strange tastes.<br> But you certainly have your work cut out<br> as mistress of Manderley.<br> To be perfectly frank with you, my dear,<br> I can't see you doing it.<br> You haven't the experience.<br> You haven't the faintest idea<br> what it means to be a great lady.<br> Of course, you know why<br> he's marrying you, don't you?<br> You haven't flattered yourself<br> that he's in love with you.<br> The fact is, that empty house<br> got on his nerves to such an extent...<br> he nearly went off his head.<br> He just couldn't go on living alone.<br> You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.<br> You'll miss your train.<br> Hmm. Mrs. De Winter.<br> Good-bye, my dear, and good luck!<br> Monsieur! Vous avez oubliez<br> votre carnet de mariage.<br> He says I've forgotten<br> the proof that we're married.<br> Good heavens!<br> Ah, somebody else had the same idea.<br> - Isn't she sweet?<br> - Yes.<br> You'd have liked<br> a bridal veil, wouldn't you?<br> Or at least...<br> Madame, madame, combien<br> c'a fait? Tout de tout?<br> Je vous remercie mille fois,<br> madame. Merci.<br> Oh, Maxim, how lovely.<br> Oh, how perfectly lovely.<br> Ah... oh... perfectly lovely.<br> - Welcome home, Mr. De Winter.<br> - Thank you, Smith.<br> - Cold, darling?<br> - Yes, just a little bit.<br> There's no need<br> to be frightened, you know.<br> Just be yourself,<br> and they'll all adore you.<br> You don't have to worry<br> about the house at all.<br> Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.<br> Just leave it to her.<br> Hello. Starting to rain.<br> We'd better hurry up.<br> Here, have this.<br> Put it over your head.<br> Thank you.<br> That's it.<br> That's Manderley.<br> Here we are, Frith.<br> Everybody well?<br> Yes, thank you, sir.<br> Glad to see you home, sir.<br> - This is Mrs. De Winter, Frith.<br> - How do you do?<br> I didn't expect the whole staff<br> to be in attendance.<br> Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.<br> Oh. Sorry about this.<br> Won't take long.<br> This is Mrs. Danvers.<br> How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> I have everything<br> in readiness for you.<br> That's very good of you.<br> I didn't expect anything.<br> I think we'd like some tea, Frith.<br> It's ready in the library, sir.<br> Come along, darling.<br> Oh, Maxim! Come in!<br> Oh, good evening, Mrs. Danvers.<br> Good evening, madam.<br> I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.<br> - Oh, yes, thank you. Perfectly.<br> - She's the parlor maid.<br> She'll have to look after you<br> until your own maid arrives.<br> Oh, but I haven't a maid.<br> I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.<br> I'm afraid that would not do<br> for very long, madam.<br> It's usual for ladies in your<br> position to have a personal maid.<br> I hope you approve the new decoration<br> of these rooms, madam.<br> Oh, I didn't know<br> it had been changed.<br> I hope you haven't been<br> to too much trouble.<br> I only followed out<br> Mr. De Winter's instructions.<br> Oh, well, what<br> did it look like before?<br> It had an old paper<br> and different hangings.<br> It was never used much,<br> except for occasional visitors.<br> Oh, then it wasn't<br> Mr. De Winter's room originally?<br> No, madam. He's never used<br> the east wing before.<br> Of course, there's no view<br> of the sea from here.<br> The only good view of the sea<br> is from the west wing.<br> The room's very charming,<br> and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.<br> If there's anything you want done,<br> madam, you have only to tell me.<br> I suppose you've been at Manderley<br> for many years, longer than anyone else.<br> Not so long as Frith. He was here<br> when the old gentleman was living,<br> when Mr. De Winter was a boy.<br> Oh, I see.<br> And you didn't come until after that?<br> I came here when<br> the first Mrs. De Winter was a bride.<br> Mrs. Danvers,<br> I do hope we'll be friends.<br> You must be patient with me.<br> This sort of life is new to me,<br> and I do want to make<br> a success of it...<br> and make Mr. De Winter happy.<br> So I know I can leave all<br> the household arrangements to you.<br> Very well. I hope I shall do everything<br> to your satisfaction, madam.<br> I've managed the house since<br> Mrs. De Winter's death,<br> and Mr. De Winter<br> has never complained.<br> I think I'll go downstairs now.<br> That room in the west wing I was telling<br> you about is there through that door.<br> It's not used now.<br> It's the most beautiful<br> room in the house...<br> the only one that looks down<br> across the lawns to the sea.<br> It was Mrs. De Winter's room.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> You're Mrs. De Winter, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - My name's Crawley.<br> I- I manage the estate for Maxim.<br> Awfully glad to meet you.<br> Fearful lot of stuff<br> piled up while Maxim was away.<br> Yes, I'm sure there must have been.<br> I, I do wish I could help<br> with some of it.<br> Oh, no. Frank never allows<br> anybody to help him.<br> He's like an old mother hen<br> with his bills and rents and taxes.<br> - Come on, Frank.<br> We must go over these estimates.<br> - I'll get my papers.<br> You'll find quantities<br> of breakfast over there.<br> - You must eat it all, or cook<br> will be mortally offended.<br> - I'll do my best, Maxim.<br> I have to go over the place with Frank<br> to make sure he hasn't lost any of it.<br> - But you'll be all right, won't you?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Getting acquainted<br> with your new home?<br> Have a look at The Times.<br> There's a thrilling article...<br> on what's the matter<br> with English cricket.<br> Oh, uh, yes, um...<br> My sister Beatrice and her husband Giles<br> Lacy have invited themselves for lunch.<br> - Today?<br> - Yes.<br> I suppose the old girl<br> can't wait to look you over.<br> You'll find her very direct.<br> If she doesn't like you,<br> she'll tell you so to your face.<br> Don't worry, darling. I'll be back<br> in time to protect you from her.<br> - Good-bye, darling.<br> - Good-bye, Maxim.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good morning, madam.<br> - Good morning, Frith.<br> Isn't there anything<br> I could get for you, madam?<br> Oh, no, thank you, Frith.<br> I'm really not very hungry.<br> Thank you.<br> - The paper, madam.<br> - Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.<br> - Madam.<br> - I slipped.<br> Oh, thank you, Frith.<br> - It's big, isn't it?<br> - Yes, madam. Manderley is a big place.<br> This was the banquet hall<br> in the old days.<br> It's still used on great occasions,<br> such as a big dinner or a ball,<br> and the public is admitted here,<br> you know, once a week.<br> That's nice.<br> I beg pardon, madam.<br> I'm afraid the fire is not usually<br> lit in the library until the afternoon.<br> But you'll find one<br> in the morning room.<br> Of course, if you wish<br> this fire lit now, madam...<br> Oh, no, Frith.<br> I wouldn't dream of it.<br> Uh, Mrs. De Winter...<br> I mean, the late Mrs. De Winter<br> always did her correspondence...<br> and telephoning in the morning<br> room after breakfast.<br> Thank you, Frith.<br> Is anything wrong, madam?<br> Oh, no.<br> Uh, which way is the morning room?<br> - Oh, it's that door there on the left.<br> - Oh, yes, thank you.<br> Mrs. De Winter?<br> Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.<br> Mrs. De Winter's been dead<br> for over a year.<br> Oh, I mean I...<br> - Oh.<br> - That was the house telephone, madam.<br> Probably the head gardener<br> wishing instructions.<br> Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?<br> Mr. De Winter informed me<br> that his sister Mrs. Lacy...<br> and Major Lacy<br> are expected for luncheon.<br> I'd like to know<br> if you approve of the menu.<br> Oh, well, I-I'm sure<br> it's very suitable, very nice indeed.<br> You'll notice, madam, that<br> I've left a blank space for the sauce.<br> Mrs. De Winter was most<br> particular about sauces.<br> Let's have whatever you think<br> that Mrs. De Winter would have wanted.<br> Thank you, madam.<br> When you've finished your letters,<br> Robert will take them to the post.<br> My let... My letters?<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.<br> - How are you, Frith?<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.<br> - Where's Mr. De Winter?<br> - I believe he went down to<br> the farm with Mr. Crawley.<br> How tiresome of him not to be here<br> when we arrive, and how typical!<br> I must say, old Danvers<br> keeps the house looking lovely.<br> She certainly learned that<br> trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.<br> I wonder how she likes it now,<br> being ordered about<br> by an ex-chorus girl.<br> Where on earth did you<br> get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?<br> He picked her up<br> in the South of France, didn't he?<br> - What if he did?<br> - Well, I mean to say, there you are.<br> How do you do? I-I'm Maxim's wife.<br> How do you do? Well, I must say you're<br> quite different from what I expected.<br> Don't be so silly.<br> She's exactly what I told you she'd be.<br> - Well, how do you like Manderley?<br> - Very beautiful, isn't it?<br> And how do you get along<br> with Mrs. Danvers?<br> Well, I... I've never met anyone<br> quite like her before.<br> You mean she scares you? She's not<br> exactly an oil painting, is she?<br> Giles, you're very much<br> in the way here. Go somewhere else.<br> I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?<br> Giles.<br> I- I didn't mean to say anything<br> against Mrs. Danvers.<br> Oh, there's no need for you<br> to be frightened of her.<br> But I shouldn't have any more<br> to do with her than you can help.<br> - Shall we sit down?<br> - Oh, yes, yes, please.<br> You see, she's bound to be<br> insanely jealous at first,<br> and she must resent you bitterly.<br> - Why should she?<br> - Don't you know?<br> I should have thought<br> Maxim would have told you.<br> She simply adored Rebecca.<br> - How are you, Robert?<br> - Quite well, thank, you, madam.<br> - Still having trouble with your teeth?<br> - Unfortunately yes, madam.<br> You should have them out, all of them.<br> Wretched nuisances, teeth.<br> - Thank you, madam.<br> - Ooh, what a plateful.<br> - Do you hunt?<br> - I don't. I'm afraid I don't even ride.<br> Oh, have to ride down here.<br> We all do.<br> Which do you ride,<br> sidesaddle or astride?<br> Oh, yes, of course, I forgot.<br> You don't, do you?<br> Huh, you must.<br> Nothing else to do down here.<br> Maxim, when are you going to have<br> parties here again like the old days?<br> - I haven't thought about it.<br> - But everyone's dying to see you and...<br> Yes, I bet they are.<br> Why don't you have<br> the masquerade ball again?<br> - Well...<br> - My dear, are you fond of dancing?<br> Oh, I love it,<br> but I'm not very good at it.<br> - Do you rhumba?<br> - I've never tried.<br> You must teach me.<br> I say, old boy, I'm trying to find out<br> exactly what your wife does do.<br> Well, she sketches a little.<br> Sketches!<br> Not this modern stuff, I hope.<br> You know, portrait<br> of a lamp shade upside-down...<br> to represent a soul in torment.<br> - Don't sail, do you?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Well, thank goodness for that. Huh?<br> You're very much in love with Maxim,<br> aren't you?<br> Yes, I can see you are.<br> Don't mind my saying so, but why don't<br> you do something about your hair?<br> Why don't you have it cut<br> or sweep it back behind your ears?<br> Oh, no, that's worse.<br> What does Maxim say about it?<br> - Does he like it like that?<br> - Well, he never mentions it.<br> Oh, well, don't go by me.<br> I can see by the way you dress,<br> you don't care a hoot how you look.<br> But I wonder Maxim<br> hasn't been at you.<br> He's so particular about clothes.<br> I don't think he ever notices<br> what I wear.<br> Oh, well,<br> he must have changed a lot, then.<br> You mustn't worry<br> about old Maxim and his moods.<br> One never knows what goes on<br> in that quiet mind of his.<br> Often he gets<br> into a terrible rage, and when he does...<br> But I don't suppose he'll<br> lose his temper with you.<br> You seem such a placid<br> little thing.<br> - Come along, old girl. We've got<br> to be on the first tee at 3:00.<br> - All right, I'm coming.<br> Well, good-bye,<br> Maxim, old boy.<br> Good-bye, Giles.<br> Thanks for coming, old boy.<br> Good-bye, my dear. Forgive me<br> for asking you so many rude questions.<br> We both really hope<br> you'll be very happy.<br> Oh, thank you, Beatrice.<br> Thank you very much.<br> And I must congratulate you<br> on the way Maxim looks.<br> We were very worried about him<br> this time last year.<br> But then, of course,<br> you know the whole story.<br> - Good-bye, Beatrice, darling.<br> - Good-bye, old boy.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Well, thank heavens they've gone.<br> Now we can have a walk about the place.<br> Looks as though we might have a shower,<br> but you won't mind that, will you?<br> - No, but I'll go get a coat.<br> - There's a heap of mackintoshes<br> in the flower room.<br> Robert,<br> run and get a coat from the flower<br> room for Mrs. De Winter, will you?<br> - What did you think of Beatrice?<br> - Oh, I liked her very much.<br> But she kept saying that I was quite<br> different from what she expected.<br> What the devil did she expect?<br> Oh, someone smarter and more<br> sophisticated, I'm afraid.<br> Do you like my hair?<br> Your hair? Yes, of course I do.<br> What's the matter with it?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I just wondered.<br> How funny you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Do I have to put it on?<br> Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly.<br> Can't be too careful with children.<br> Come on, Jasper.<br> Come and take some of that fat off.<br> Jasper!<br> Here, not that way!<br> Come here!<br> Where does that lead to?<br> - Oh, it leads to a little cove<br> where we used to keep a boat.<br> - Oh, let's go down there.<br> Oh, no, it's a perfectly dull,<br> uninteresting stretch of sand,<br> just like any other.<br> - Oh, please.<br> - Well, all right.<br> We'll walk down and take a look,<br> if you really want to.<br> That's Jasper. There must be something<br> wrong. Perhaps he's hurt himself.<br> - No, he's all right.<br> - Don't you think I'd better go and see?<br> Don't bother about him.<br> He can't come to any harm.<br> He'll find his own way back.<br> Jasper! Jasper!<br> Oh, there you are.<br> What do you want in there, Jasper?<br> Come on. Come on home.<br> Let's go home. Jasper. Jas...<br> Oh... I didn't know<br> that there was anybody...<br> I know that dog.<br> He comes fr' the house.<br> He ain't your'n.<br> No, he's<br> Mr. De Winter's dog.<br> Have you anything<br> I could tie him with?<br> Come on, Jasper.<br> You won't tell anyone<br> you saw me in there, will ya?<br> Don't you belong<br> on the estate?<br> I weren't doin' nothin'.<br> I was just puttin'<br> my shells away.<br> She's gone in the sea,<br> ain't she?<br> She'll never come back<br> no more.<br> No, she'll never come back.<br> Come on, Jasper.<br> Maxim!<br> What's the matter?<br> Maxim!<br> I'm sorry I was such a time,<br> but I had to find a rope<br> forJasper.<br> Hurry up, Jasper!<br> For heaven's sake!<br> Please wait for me. Maxim,<br> what is it? You look so angry.<br> You knew I didn't<br> want you to go there,<br> but you deliberately went.<br> Why not?<br> There was only a cottage<br> down there and a strange man...<br> You didn't go into<br> the cottage, did you?<br> Yes. The door...<br> Well, don't go there<br> again, do you hear!<br> Well, why not?<br> If you had my memories,<br> you wouldn't go there<br> or even think about it!<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, I'm sorry. Please.<br> We should have stayed away.<br> We should never have come<br> back to Manderley.<br> Oh, what a fool I was!<br> I've made you unhappy.<br> Somehow I've hurt you.<br> Oh, I can't bear<br> to see you like this...<br> because I love you so much.<br> Do you? Do you?<br> I've made you cry.<br> Forgive me.<br> I sometimes seem to fly<br> off the handle for no reason at all.<br> Don't I?<br> Come, we'll go home,<br> have some tea and forget all about it.<br> Yes, let's forget all about it.<br> Here, let me haveJasper.<br> - Hello. Come in.<br> - Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.<br> I was just wondering if you meant<br> what you said the other day...<br> about showing me<br> the run of things?<br> - Of course I did.<br> - What are you doing now?<br> Notifying all the tenants that,<br> in celebration...<br> of Maxim's<br> return with his bride,<br> this week's rent will be free.<br> Oh, was that Maxim's idea?<br> Oh, yes. All the servants<br> get an extra week's wages too.<br> Oh, he didn't tell me.<br> Can't I help you?<br> I could at least lick the stamps.<br> That's terribly nice of you.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> Oh, yes, thank you.<br> I, I was down at the cottage<br> on the beach the other day.<br> There was a man there...<br> a queer sort of person.<br> - Jasper kept barking at him.<br> - Oh, yes. Must've been Ben.<br> Excuse me.<br> He's quite harmless.<br> We give him odd jobs now and then.<br> That cottage place seemed<br> to be going to wreck and ruin.<br> Why isn't something<br> done about it?<br> Well, I think if Maxim wanted anything<br> done about it, he'd tell me.<br> Are those all<br> Rebecca's things down there?<br> Yes. Yes, they are.<br> What did she use the cottage for?<br> The boat used to be moored near there.<br> What boat? What happened to it?<br> Was that the boat she was sailing<br> in when she was drowned?<br> Yes. It capsized and sank.<br> She was washed overboard.<br> Wasn't she afraid<br> to go out like that alone?<br> She wasn't afraid of anything.<br> Where did they find her?<br> Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles<br> up channel, about two months afterwards.<br> Maxim went up to identify her.<br> It was horrible for him.<br> Yes, it must have been.<br> Mr. Crawley, please don't<br> think me morbidly curious.<br> It isn't that. It's just<br> that I feel at such a disadvantage.<br> All the time,<br> whenever I meet anyone,<br> Maxim's sister<br> or even the servants,<br> I know they're all<br> thinking the same thing.<br> They're all comparing me<br> with her, with Rebecca.<br> Oh, you mustn't think that.<br> I can't tell you how glad I am<br> that you've married Maxim.<br> It's going to make<br> all the difference to his life.<br> And from my point of view,<br> it's very refreshing...<br> to find someone like yourself<br> who's not entirely in tune,<br> shall we say, with Manderley.<br> That's very sweet of you.<br> I dare say I've been stupid,<br> but every day I realize<br> things that she had and that I lack:<br> Beauty and wit and intelligence...<br> and, oh, all the things that<br> are so important in a woman.<br> But you have qualities<br> that are just as important...<br> more important, if I may say so.<br> Kindliness and sincerity...<br> and, if you'll forgive me, modesty...<br> mean more to a husband than<br> all the wit and beauty in the worid.<br> We none of us want to live<br> in the past. Maxim least of all.<br> It's up to you, you know,<br> to lead us away from it.<br> Well, I promise you<br> I won't bring this up again,<br> but before we end<br> this conversation...<br> would you answer<br> just one more question?<br> If it's something<br> I'm able to answer, I'll do my best.<br> Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?<br> I suppose...<br> I suppose she was the most<br> beautiful creature I ever saw.<br> - Good evening, Maxim.<br> - Hello.<br> The films of the honeymoon<br> have arrived at last.<br> Have we time, do you think,<br> before dinner?<br> Well, what on earth<br> have you done to yourself?<br> Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress<br> from London. I hope you don't mind.<br> Oh, no. Only do you think that<br> sort of thing is right for you?<br> - It doesn't seem your type at all.<br> - I thought you'd like it.<br> And what have you done to your hair?<br> Oh, I see.<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear.<br> Oh, dear. I'm sorry.<br> You look lovely, lovely.<br> That's very nice... for a change.<br> Shall we see these pictures?<br> Yes, I'd love to see them.<br> Ah, look, now. Look at that.<br> Wasn't it wonderful, darling?<br> Can't we go back there someday?<br> Yes, of course, of course.<br> Ah, look at you. There.<br> Won't our grandchildren be delighted<br> when they see how lovely you were?<br> Oh, look at you!<br> Oh, I like that.<br> Look at that.<br> - Yes, very nice.<br> - Oh, remember that?<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh, I wish our honeymoon could<br> have lasted forever, Maxim.<br> Oh, dash it! Look.<br> Oh. Oh. Oh, hang it.<br> I've threaded it up wrong,<br> as usual, or something.<br> Yes, Frith, what is it?<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> May I have a word with you?<br> Yes. Come in.<br> It's about Robert, sir.<br> There's been a slight unpleasantness<br> between him and Mrs. Danvers.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Robert is very upset.<br> This is trouble. What is it?<br> It appears Mrs. Danvers<br> has accused Robert...<br> of stealing a valuable ornament<br> from the morning room.<br> Robert denies the accusation<br> most emphatically, sir.<br> - What was the thing, anyway?<br> - The china cupid, sir.<br> Oh, dear.<br> That's one of our treasures, isn't it?<br> Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get<br> to the bottom of it somehow<br> and I'm sure it wasn't Robert.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Why do they come to me with these<br> things? That's your job, sweetheart.<br> Maxim, I wanted to tell you,<br> but, um, well, I forgot.<br> - The fact is, I broke the china cupid.<br> - You broke it?<br> Now, why on earth didn't you say<br> something about it when Frith was here?<br> I don't know.<br> I didn't like to.<br> I was afraid he'd think me a fool.<br> Well, he'll think you<br> much more a fool now.<br> You'll have to explain to him<br> and Mrs. Danvers.<br> - No, you do it. I'll go upstairs.<br> - Don't be such a little idiot.<br> Anybody would think<br> you were afraid of them.<br> It was all a mistake,<br> Mrs. Danvers.<br> Apparently, Mrs. De Winter<br> broke the cupid herself...<br> and forgot to say anything about it.<br> I'm so sorry. I... I never thought<br> that I'd get Robert into trouble.<br> Is it possible to repair<br> the ornament, madam?<br> No, I'm afraid it isn't.<br> It was smashed into pieces.<br> What did you do with the pieces?<br> Well, I-I put them at the back of one<br> of the drawers in the writing desk.<br> Well, it looks as though<br> Mrs. De Winter were afraid...<br> you were going to put her in prison,<br> doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?<br> Find the pieces, see if they can be<br> mended and tell Robert to dry his tears.<br> I shall apologize<br> to Robert, of course.<br> Perhaps if such a thing happens again,<br> Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally...<br> Yes, yes, all right.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.<br> Well, I suppose that clip<br> will hold all right. I don't know.<br> I'm awfully sorry, darling.<br> It was very careless of me.<br> Mrs. Danvers<br> must be furious with me.<br> Oh, hang Mrs. Danvers. Why on earth<br> should you be frightened of her?<br> You behave more like<br> an upstairs maid or something,<br> not like the mistress<br> of the house at all.<br> Yes, I know I do.<br> But I feel so uncomfortable.<br> I, I try my best every day,<br> but it's very difficult...<br> with people looking me up and<br> down as if I were a prize cow.<br> Well, what does it matter<br> if they do?<br> You must remember<br> that life at Manderley...<br> is the only thing that<br> interests anybody down here.<br> What a slap in the eye<br> I must have been to them, then.<br> I suppose that's<br> why you married me.<br> Because you knew I was dull<br> and gauche and inexperienced...<br> and there could never be<br> any gossip about me.<br> Gossip?<br> What do you mean?<br> I- I don't know.<br> I just said it for something to say.<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> Maxim, what's the matter?<br> What have I said?<br> It wasn't a very attractive<br> thing to say, was it?<br> No. It was rude, hateful.<br> I wonder if I did a very selfish<br> thing in marrying you.<br> How do you mean?<br> I'm not much of a companion<br> to you, am I?<br> You don't get much fun, do you?<br> You ought to have married a boy,<br> someone of your own age.<br> Maxim, why do you say this?<br> Of course we're companions.<br> Are we? I don't know.<br> I'm very difficult to live with.<br> No, you're not difficult.<br> You're easy, very easy.<br> Our marriage is a success,<br> isn't it? A great success?<br> We're happy, aren't we?<br> Terribly happy.<br> If you don't think<br> we are happy,<br> it would be much better<br> if you didn't pretend.<br> I'll go away.<br> Why don't you answer me?<br> How can I answer you when<br> I don't know the answer myself?<br> If you say we're happy,<br> let's leave it at that.<br> Happiness is something<br> I know nothing about.<br> Oh, look, there's the one...<br> when I left the camera running<br> on the tripod, remember?<br> Pardon me, madam.<br> Is there anything I can do for you?<br> I'm all right, Hilda.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'll bring the sandwiches<br> immediately, madam.<br> - Hilda.<br> - Yes, madam?<br> The west wing...<br> Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?<br> No, madam.<br> Not since the death of Mrs. De Winter.<br> Come along,<br> Mr. Jack, or someone may see you.<br> Well, Danny, old harpy,<br> it's been good to see you again.<br> I've been simply breathless<br> to pick up all the news.<br> I don't think it's<br> wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.<br> - Jasper, come here.<br> - Oh, nonsense.<br> It's just like coming back home.<br> - Quiet, Mr. Jack.<br> - Yes, and we must be careful<br> not to shock Cinderella.<br> She's in the morning room.<br> If you leave through the garden<br> door, she won't see you.<br> I must say I feel a little<br> like the poor relation,<br> sneaking around<br> through back doors.<br> - Well, toodle-oo, Danny.<br> - Good-bye, Mr. Jack, and be careful.<br> Jasper, quiet!<br> Looking for me?<br> Oh, I didn't make you jump, did I?<br> No, of course not.<br> I didn't quite know who it was.<br> - Yes, you're pleased to see me,<br> aren't you, old boy?<br> I'm glad there's someone in the family<br> to welcome me back to Manderley.<br> And, um,<br> how is dear old Max?<br> Very well, thank you.<br> I hear he went up to London,<br> left his little bride all alone.<br> That's too bad.<br> Isn't he rather afraid that somebody<br> might come down and carry you off?<br> Danny, all your precautions<br> were in vain.<br> The mistress of the house<br> was hiding behind the door.<br> Oh, what about presenting me<br> to the bride?<br> - This is Mr. Favell, madam.<br> - How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> Won't you have<br> some tea or something?<br> Now, isn't that<br> a charming invitation?<br> I've been asked to stay to tea, Danny,<br> and I've a good mind to accept.<br> Oh, well, perhaps you're right. Pity,<br> just when we were getting on so nicely.<br> We mustn't lead the young bride<br> astray, must we, Jasper?<br> Good-bye.<br> It's been fun meeting you.<br> Oh, and by the way, it would be<br> very decent of you...<br> if you wouldn't mention this little<br> visit to your revered husband.<br> He doesn't exactly<br> approve of me.<br> - Very well.<br> - That's very sporting of you.<br> I wish I had a young bride of three<br> months waiting for me at home.<br> I'm just a lonely old bachelor.<br> Fare thee well.<br> Oh, and I know what was wrong<br> with that introduction.<br> Danny didn't tell you, did she?<br> I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.<br> Toodle-oo.<br> Do you wish anything, madam?<br> I didn't expect to see you,<br> Mrs. Danvers.<br> I noticed a window wasn't closed, and<br> I came up to see if I could fasten it.<br> Why did you say that?<br> I closed it before I left the room.<br> You opened it yourself,<br> didn't you?<br> You've always wanted to see<br> this room, haven't you, madam?<br> Why did you never ask me<br> to show it to you?<br> I was ready to show it to you<br> every day.<br> It's a lovely room, isn't it?<br> The loveliest room<br> you've ever seen.<br> Everything is kept<br> just as Mrs. De Winter liked it.<br> Nothing has been altered<br> since that last night.<br> Come. I'll show you<br> her dressing room.<br> This is where I keep<br> all her clothes.<br> You would like to see them,<br> wouldn't you?<br> Feel this.<br> It was a Christmas present<br> from Mr. De Winter.<br> He was always giving her expensive<br> gifts, the whole year round.<br> I keep her underwear<br> on this side.<br> They were made specially for her by<br> the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.<br> I always used to wait up<br> for her, no matter how late.<br> Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter<br> didn't come home until dawn.<br> While she was undressing, she'd tell me<br> about the party she'd been to.<br> She knew everyone that mattered,<br> and everyone loved her.<br> When she'd finished her bath,<br> she'd go into the bedroom and<br> go over to the dressing table.<br> Oh, you've moved<br> her brush, haven't you?<br> There, that's better...<br> just as she always laid it down.<br> "Come on, Danny,<br> hair drill," she would say.<br> I'd stand behind her like this<br> and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.<br> And then she would say,<br> "Good night, Danny,"<br> and step into her bed.<br> I embroidered this case<br> for her myself,<br> and I keep it here always.<br> Did you ever see<br> anything so delicate?<br> Look, you can see<br> my hand through it.<br> You wouldn't think she'd<br> been gone so long, would you?<br> Sometimes when I walk<br> along the corridor,<br> I fancy I hear her<br> just behind me.<br> That quick, light step.<br> I couldn't mistake it anywhere.<br> It's not only in this room.<br> It's in all the rooms in the house.<br> I can almost hear it now.<br> Do you think the dead<br> come back and watch the living?<br> No, I don't believe it.<br> Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't<br> come back here to Manderley...<br> and watch you<br> and Mr. De Winter together.<br> You look tired. Why don't you<br> stay here a while and rest...<br> and listen to the sea?<br> It's so soothing.<br> Listen to it.<br> Listen.<br> Listen to the sea.<br> Tell Mrs. Danvers<br> I wish to see her immediately.<br> You sent for me, madam?<br> Yes, Mrs. Danvers.<br> I want you to get rid<br> of all these things.<br> These are Mrs. De Winter's things.<br> I am Mrs. De Winter now.<br> Very well.<br> I'll give the instructions.<br> Just a moment, please.<br> Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to<br> Mr. De Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.<br> In fact, I'd prefer to forget everything<br> that happened this afternoon.<br> Oh, Maxim, Maxim,<br> you've been gone all day!<br> You're choking me.<br> Well. Well, well, well.<br> - What have you been doing?<br> - Oh, I've been thinking.<br> - What did you want to do that for?<br> - Come in here and I'll tell you.<br> Darling, could we have<br> a costume ball...<br> just as you used to?<br> Now, what put that<br> into your mind?<br> Has Beatrice been at you?<br> No, no, but I feel that<br> we ought to do something...<br> to make people feel that Manderley<br> is just the same as it always was.<br> Oh, please, darling, could we?<br> You don't know<br> what it would mean, you know.<br> You would have to be hostess<br> to hundreds of people, all the county.<br> And a lot of young people would<br> come up from London and turn<br> the house into a night club.<br> Oh, yes, but I want to.<br> Oh, please.<br> I've never been to a large party,<br> but I could learn what to do.<br> And I promise you,<br> you wouldn't be ashamed of me.<br> All right,<br> if you think you'd enjoy it.<br> You'd better get Mrs. Danvers<br> to help you, hadn't you?<br> No, no. I don't need<br> Mrs. Danvers to help me.<br> - I can do it myself.<br> - All right, my sweet.<br> Oh, thank you, darling.<br> Thank you.<br> - Oh, what'll you go as?<br> - Oh, I never dress up.<br> That's the one privilege<br> I claim as the host.<br> What will you be? Alice in Wonderland<br> with that ribbon around your hair?<br> I won't tell.<br> I'll design my costume...<br> all by myself and give<br> you the surprise of your life.<br> Come in.<br> Robert found these sketches<br> in the library, madam.<br> - Did you intend throwing them away?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.<br> They were just some ideas I was<br> sketching for my costume for the ball.<br> Hasn't Mr. De Winter<br> suggested anything?<br> No, I want to surprise him. I don't<br> want him to know anything about it.<br> I merely thought that<br> you might find a costume...<br> among the family portraits<br> that would suit you.<br> Oh, you mean those at the top of<br> the stairs? I'll go and look at them.<br> This one, for instance.<br> It might have been designed for you.<br> I'm sure you could have it copied.<br> I've heard Mr. De Winter say that this<br> is his favorite of all the paintings.<br> It's Lady Caroline de Winter,<br> one of his ancestors.<br> Oh, well, well, that's a splendid idea,<br> Mrs. Danvers. I'm-I'm very grateful.<br> - Everything under control, Frith?<br> - Yes, sir. Thank you.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?<br> Oh, no, this is just<br> my old cap and gown.<br> Certainly makes a very nice costume,<br> sir, and economical too.<br> Yes. That was the idea.<br> Evening, Robert.<br> Not very good weather for the ball.<br> - No, sir.<br> - Very misty on the way and very chilly.<br> Oh, this wig's so tight, they ought<br> to have sent an aspirin with it.<br> Hello. What's the idea?<br> Adam and Eve?<br> - Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.<br> - Strong man, old man.<br> - Where's my weight thing?<br> - What thing?<br> - You haven't left it in the car?<br> - Oh, no, there it is.<br> Are you the first one down?<br> Where's the child?<br> She's keeping her costume a terrific<br> secret. Wouldn't let me into her room.<br> Oh, lovely.<br> I'll go up and give her a hand.<br> - I could do with a drink.<br> - Won't you catch cold in that thing?<br> Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.<br> Pardon me, sir.<br> You forgot this.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Here I am, dear. It's Bee.<br> I've come to give you a hand.<br> Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice.<br> I don't want anyone to see my costume.<br> Oh. Oh, well,<br> you won't be long, will you?<br> Because the first people<br> will be arriving any moment.<br> - Now, you're sure that's<br> where that should be?<br> - Yes, madam, it's just right.<br> - Oh, isn't this exciting?<br> - Indeed it is, madam.<br> I've always heard of the Manderley Ball.<br> Now I'm really going to see one.<br> I'm sure there'll be no one there<br> to touch you, madam.<br> Do you really think so?<br> Now, where's my fan?<br> Now, you're sure<br> I look all right?<br> You look ever so beautiful.<br> Well, here goes.<br> Good evening, Mr. De Winter.<br> What the devil<br> do you think you're doing?<br> Rebecca! Oh.<br> But i-it's the picture,<br> the one in the gallery.<br> What is it?<br> What have I done?<br> Go and take it off. It doesn't matter<br> what you put on. Anything will do.<br> What are you standing there for?<br> Didn't you hear what I said?<br> Sir George and Lady Moore.<br> Dudley Tennant.<br> Admiral and Lady Burbank.<br> I watched you go down...<br> just as I watched her a year ago.<br> Even in the same dress,<br> you couldn't compare.<br> You knew it!<br> You knew that she wore it,<br> and yet you deliberately<br> suggested I wear it!<br> Why do you hate me? What have I done<br> to you that you should ever hate me so?<br> You tried to take her place.<br> You let him marry you.<br> I've seen his face, his eyes.<br> They're the same as those first<br> weeks after she died.<br> I used to listen to him<br> walking up and down, up and down,<br> all night long,<br> night after night,<br> thinking of her, suffering<br> torture because he'd lost her.<br> I don't want to know.<br> I don't want to know.<br> You thought you could be<br> Mrs. De Winter,<br> live in her house, walk in her steps,<br> take the things that were hers.<br> But she's too strong for you.<br> You can't fight her.<br> No one ever got the better<br> of her, never, never.<br> She was beaten in the end,<br> but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.<br> - It was the sea!<br> - Oh, stop it, stop it. Oh, stop it.<br> You're overwrought, madam.<br> I've opened a window for you.<br> A little air will do you good.<br> Why don't you go?<br> Why don't you leave Manderley?<br> He doesn't need you.<br> He's got his memories.<br> He doesn't love you.<br> He wants to be alone again with her.<br> You've nothing to stay for.<br> You've nothing to live for,<br> really, have you?<br> Look down there.<br> It's easy, isn't it?<br> Why don't you?<br> Why don't you?<br> Go on... go on.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Shipwreck! Ship on the rocks!<br> It's a ship aground,<br> sending up rockets.<br> Shipwreck! Come on, everybody, down<br> to the bay! Notify the Coast Guard!<br> Oh, Maxim! Maxim!<br> - Ship ashore!<br> - Come on, come on! Everybody!<br> Maxim! Maxim!<br> Oh!<br> Ben, have you seen<br> Mr. De Winter anywhere?<br> She won't come back, will she?<br> You said so.<br> Who, Ben?<br> What do you mean?<br> Uh, the other one.<br> Oh, Frank,<br> have you seen Maxim anywhere?<br> Not since about half an hour ago.<br> I thought he'd gone up to the house.<br> No, he hasn't been<br> to the house at all,<br> and I'm afraid something<br> might have happened to him.<br> Frank, what's the matter?<br> Is anything wrong?<br> There is something wrong.<br> Well, the diver who went down<br> to inspect the bottom of the ship...<br> came across the hull<br> of another boat...<br> a little sailboat.<br> - Frank, is it...<br> - Yes, it's Rebecca's.<br> How did they recognize it?<br> He's a local man.<br> Knew it instantly.<br> It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.<br> Yes, it's going to bring it<br> all back again,<br> and worse than before.<br> Why did they have to find it?<br> Why couldn't they have left it there<br> in peace, at the bottom of the sea?<br> Well, I'd better get along<br> and arrange some breakfast for the men.<br> All right, Frank.<br> I'll go and look for Maxim.<br> Hello.<br> Maxim.<br> You haven't had any sleep.<br> Have you forgiven me?<br> Forgiven you?<br> What have I got to forgive you for?<br> For last night,<br> my stupidity about the costume.<br> Oh, that.<br> I'd forgotten.<br> I was angry with you, wasn't I?<br> Hmm.<br> Maxim, can't we start all over again?<br> I don't ask that you should love me.<br> I won't ask impossible things.<br> I'll be your friend, your companion.<br> I'll be happy with that.<br> You love me very much, don't you?<br> But it's too late, my darling.<br> We've lost our little<br> chance of happiness.<br> - No, Maxim, no.<br> - Yes. It's all over now.<br> The thing's happened.<br> The thing I've dreaded<br> day after day,<br> night after night.<br> Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?<br> Rebecca has won.<br> Her shadow has been<br> between us all the time,<br> keeping us from one another.<br> She knew<br> that this would happen.<br> What are you saying?<br> They sent a diver down.<br> He found another boat.<br> Yes, I know. Frank told me.<br> Rebecca's boat.<br> Oh, it's terrible for you.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> The diver made another discovery.<br> He broke one of the ports<br> and looked into the cabin.<br> There was a body in there.<br> Then she wasn't alone.<br> There was someone sailing with her,<br> and you have to find out who it was.<br> That's it, isn't it, Maxim?<br> You don't understand.<br> There was no one with her.<br> It's Rebecca's body<br> lying there on the cabin floor.<br> Oh, no.<br> The woman that was washed up<br> at Edgecombe,<br> the woman that is now buried<br> in the family crypt,<br> that was not Rebecca.<br> That was the body<br> of some unknown woman,<br> unclaimed, belonging nowhere.<br> I identified it,<br> but I knew it wasn't Rebecca.<br> It was all a lie.<br> I knew where<br> Rebecca's body was.<br> Lying on that cabin floor<br> on the bottom of the sea.<br> How did you know, Maxim?<br> Because I put it there.<br> Will you look into my eyes and<br> tell me that you love me now?<br> You see? I was right.<br> It's too late.<br> No, it's not too late.<br> You're not to say that.<br> I love you more<br> than anything in the worid.<br> Oh, please, Maxim,<br> kiss me, please.<br> No. It's no use.<br> It's too late.<br> We can't lose each other now.<br> We must be together always,<br> with no secrets, no shadows.<br> We may only have<br> a few days, a few hours.<br> Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?<br> I nearly did sometimes,<br> but you never seemed close enough.<br> How could we be close when I knew<br> you were always thinking of Rebecca?<br> How could I even ask you to love me<br> when I knew you loved Rebecca still?<br> What are you talking about?<br> What do you mean?<br> Whenever you touched me, I knew<br> you were comparing me with Rebecca.<br> Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me<br> or walked with me in the garden,<br> I knew you were thinking,<br> "This I did with Rebecca,<br> and this and this."<br> Oh, it's true, isn't it?<br> You thought I loved Rebecca?<br> You thought that?<br> I hated her.<br> Oh, I was carried away by her,<br> enchanted by her, as everyone was.<br> And when I was married, I was told<br> I was the luckiest man in the worid.<br> She was so lovely,<br> so accomplished, so amusing.<br> "She's got the three things that really<br> matter in a wife," everyone said.<br> "Breeding, brains and beauty."<br> And I believed them, completely.<br> But I never had<br> a moment's happiness with her.<br> She was incapable of love...<br> or tenderness or decency.<br> You didn't love her?<br> You didn't love her?<br> Do you remember that cliff<br> where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?<br> Well, I went there with Rebecca<br> on our honeymoon.<br> That was where<br> I found out about her.<br> Four days<br> after we were married.<br> She stood there laughing,<br> her black hair<br> blowing in the wind,<br> and told me all about herself.<br> Everything.<br> Things I'll never tell a living soul.<br> I wanted to kill her.<br> It would have been so easy.<br> Remember the precipice?<br> I frightened you, didn't I?<br> You thought I was mad.<br> Perhaps I was.<br> Perhaps I am mad.<br> It wouldn't make for sanity, would it,<br> living with the devil?<br> "I'll make a bargain with you,"<br> she said.<br> "You'd look rather foolish<br> trying to divorce me now<br> after four days of marriage,<br> "so I'll play the part<br> of a devoted wife, mistress<br> of your precious Manderley.<br> "I'll make it the most famous<br> showplace in England, if you like,<br> "and people will visit us<br> and envy us...<br> "and say we're the luckiest,<br> happiest couple in the country.<br> What a grand joke it will be!<br> What a triumph!"<br> I should never have accepted<br> her dirty bargain, but I did.<br> I was younger then and tremendously<br> conscious of the family honor.<br> Family honor.<br> She knew that<br> I'd sacrifice everything...<br> rather than stand up<br> in a divorce court...<br> and give her away, admit that<br> our marriage was a rotten fraud.<br> You despise me, don't you?<br> As I despise myself.<br> You can't understand what<br> my feelings were, can you?<br> Of course I can, darling.<br> Of course I can.<br> Well, I kept the bargain.<br> And so did she, apparently.<br> Oh, she played the game brilliantly.<br> But after a while,<br> she began to grow careless.<br> She took a flat in London,<br> and she'd stay away for days at a time.<br> Then she started to bring<br> her friends down here.<br> I warned her,<br> but she shrugged her shoulders.<br> "What's it got to do with you?"<br> She said.<br> She even started on Frank.<br> Poor, faithful Frank.<br> Then there was a cousin of hers,<br> a man named Favell.<br> Yes, I know him.<br> He came the day you went to London.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I didn't like to. I thought<br> it would remind you of Rebecca.<br> Remind me!<br> As if I needed reminding.<br> Favell used to visit her<br> here in this cottage.<br> I found out about it,<br> and I warned her...<br> that if he came here again,<br> I'd shoot them both.<br> One night when I found that<br> she'd come back quietly from London,<br> I thought that Favell<br> was with her,<br> and I knew then I couldn't stand this<br> life of filth and deceit any longer.<br> I decided to come down here and<br> have it out with both of them.<br> But she was alone.<br> She was expecting Favell,<br> but he hadn't come.<br> She was lying on the divan,<br> a large tray of cigarette<br> stubs beside her.<br> She looked ill, queer.<br> Suddenly she got up,<br> started to walk toward me.<br> "When I have a child,<br> she said,<br> "neither you nor anyone else<br> could ever prove it wasn't yours.<br> You'd like to have an heir, wouldn't<br> you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"<br> Then she started to laugh.<br> "How funny.<br> How supremely, wonderfully funny.<br> "I'd be the perfect mother,<br> just as I've been the perfect wife.<br> "No one will ever know.<br> "It ought to give you<br> the thrill of your life, Max,<br> "to watch my son grow bigger<br> day by day...<br> and to know that when you die,<br> Manderley will be his. "<br> She was face to face with me,<br> one hand in her pocket,<br> the other holding a cigarette.<br> She was smiling.<br> "Well, Max,<br> what are you going to do about it?<br> Aren't you going to kill me?"<br> I suppose I went mad for a moment.<br> I must have struck her.<br> She stood staring at me.<br> She looked almost triumphant.<br> Then she started<br> toward me again, smiling.<br> Suddenly she stumbled and fell.<br> When I looked down... ages afterwards,<br> it seemed... she was lying on the floor.<br> She'd struck her head on a heavy<br> piece of ship's tackle.<br> I remember wondering<br> why she was still smiling...<br> then I realized she was dead.<br> But you didn't kill her!<br> It was an accident!<br> Who would believe me?<br> I lost my head.<br> I just knew I had to do something,<br> anything.<br> I carried her out to the boat.<br> It was very dark.<br> There was no moon.<br> I put her in the cabin.<br> When the boat seemed a safe distance<br> from the shore, I took a spike...<br> and drove it again and again<br> through the planking of the hull.<br> I had opened up the seacocks,<br> and the water began to come in fast.<br> I climbed over into the dinghy<br> and pulled away.<br> I saw the boat heel over... and sink.<br> I pulled back into the cove.<br> It started raining.<br> Maxim, does anyone else know this?<br> No, no one, except you and me.<br> We must explain it.<br> It's got to be the body<br> of someone you've never seen before.<br> No, they're bound to know her.<br> Her rings, bracelets she always wore.<br> They'll identify her body,<br> then they'll remember the other woman,<br> the other woman<br> buried in the crypt.<br> If they find out it was Rebecca,<br> you must simply say that you made<br> a mistake about the other body...<br> that the day you went<br> to Edgecombe, you were ill,<br> you didn't know what you were doing.<br> Rebecca's dead.<br> That's what we've got to remember.<br> Rebecca's dead.<br> She can't speak.<br> She can't bear witness.<br> She can't harm you anymore.<br> We're the only two people in the worid<br> that know, Maxim... you and I.<br> I told you once that I'd done<br> a very selfish thing in marrying you.<br> You can understand now<br> what I meant.<br> I've loved you, my darling.<br> I shall always love you.<br> But I've known all along that<br> Rebecca would win in the end.<br> No, no, she hasn't won.<br> No matter what happens now,<br> she hasn't won.<br> Hello? Hel...<br> Hello, Frank.<br> Hello, Frank. Yes.<br> Who? ColonelJulyan?<br> Yes, tell him I'll meet him<br> there as soon as I possibly can.<br> What? Oh.<br> Well, say we could talk about that<br> when we're sure about the matter.<br> What's happened?<br> ColonelJulyan called.<br> He's the chief constable of the county.<br> He's been asked by the police<br> to go to the mortuary.<br> He wants to know if I could<br> possibly have made a mistake...<br> about that other body.<br> Well, ColonelJulyan, apparently I did<br> make a mistake about that other body.<br> The mistake was quite natural<br> under the circumstances.<br> - Besides, you weren't well at the time.<br> - I was perfectly well.<br> Well, don't let it worry you, Maxim.<br> Nobody can blame you<br> for making a mistake.<br> The pity is, you've got to go through<br> the same thing all over again.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Oh, there'll have to be<br> another inquest, of course.<br> - The same formality and red tape.<br> - Oh.<br> I wish you could be spared<br> the publicity of it,<br> but I'm afraid that's impossible.<br> Oh, yes, the publicity.<br> I suppose Mrs. De Winter<br> went below for something...<br> and a squall hit the boat<br> with nobody at the helm.<br> I imagine that's about the solution<br> of it, don't you think so, Crawley?<br> Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed<br> and she couldn't get on deck again.<br> Yes. Tabb, the boatbuilder,<br> will undoubtedly come<br> to some such conclusion.<br> Why? What would he know about it?<br> Well, he's examining the boat now.<br> Purely as a matter of routine,<br> you know.<br> I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim...<br> quite unofficially, you know.<br> We must get together for a game of golf<br> when it's all over, eh?<br> - Yes.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> I have the evening papers, madam.<br> - Would you care to see them?<br> - Oh, no thank you, Frith,<br> and I'd prefer that Mr. De Winter<br> weren't troubled with them either.<br> I understand, madam. Permit me to say<br> that we're all most distressed outside.<br> - Oh, thank you, Frith.<br> - I'm afraid the news has been<br> a shock to Mrs. Danvers.<br> Yes, I rather expected it would be.<br> It seems there's to be<br> a coroner's inquest, madam?<br> Yes, Frith.<br> It's purely a formality.<br> Of course, madam.<br> I, I wanted to say...<br> that if any of us might be<br> required to give evidence,<br> I should be only too pleased to do<br> anything that might help the family.<br> Oh, thank you, Frith. I'm sure Mr.<br> De Winter will be very happy to hear it.<br> But I don't think<br> anything will be necessary.<br> Maxim!<br> Hello, darling.<br> Oh, Maxim, I'm, I'm worried about<br> what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.<br> What do you mean?<br> You won't lose your temper, will you?<br> Promise me that they<br> won't make you angry.<br> All right, darling, I promise.<br> No matter what he asks you,<br> you won't lose your head.<br> Don't worry, dear.<br> They can't do anything at once,<br> can they?<br> No.<br> - Then we've a little time<br> left to be together?<br> - Yes.<br> I want to go<br> to the inquest with you.<br> I'd rather you didn't, darling.<br> But I can't wait here alone.<br> I promise you I won't be<br> any trouble to you.<br> And I must be near you so<br> that no matter what happens,<br> we won't be separated<br> for a moment.<br> All right, dear.<br> I don't mind this whole thing,<br> except for you.<br> I can't forget<br> what it's done to you.<br> I've been thinking of nothing<br> else since it happened.<br> Ahhh...<br> it's gone forever.<br> That funny, young,<br> lost look I loved...<br> won't ever come back.<br> I killed that when I told you<br> about Rebecca.<br> It's gone.<br> In a few hours...<br> you've grown so much older.<br> Oh, Maxim, Maxim.<br> BlackJack Brady was his name.<br> The most important arrest<br> I ever made.<br> It must have been<br> about two years ago now.<br> Of course there was<br> no doubt about it.<br> He was hung<br> a month after I caught him.<br> Hello, wait a minute.<br> They've got<br> old Balmy Ben up now.<br> You remember the late<br> Mrs. De Winter, don't you?<br> - She's gone.<br> - Yes, we know that.<br> She went in the sea.<br> The sea got her.<br> That's right, that's right.<br> Now, we want you to tell us...<br> whether you were on the shore<br> that last night she went sailing.<br> - Eh?<br> - Were you on the shore...<br> that last night she went out,<br> when she didn't come back?<br> I didn't see nothin'.<br> I don't want to go to the asylum.<br> Them cruel folks there.<br> Now, nobody's going<br> to send you to the asylum.<br> All we want you to do<br> is tell us what you saw.<br> I didn't see nothin'.<br> Come, come. Did you see Mrs. De Winter<br> get into her boat that last night?<br> I don't know nothin'.<br> I don't want to go to the asylum.<br> - Very well, you may go.<br> - Eh?<br> You may go now.<br> Mr. Tabb, would you<br> step forward, please?<br> The evidence you give will<br> be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> I do, so help me God.<br> The late Mrs. De Winter<br> used to send her boat to your<br> shipyard for reconditioning.<br> - That's right, sir.<br> - Can you remember any occasion...<br> - when she had any sort<br> of accident with the boat?<br> - No, sir.<br> I often said Mrs. De Winter<br> was a born sailor.<br> Now, when Mrs. De Winter<br> went below, as is supposed,<br> and a sudden gust of wind<br> came down,<br> that would be enough to capsize<br> the boat, wouldn't it?<br> Excuse me, sir, but there's<br> a little more to it than that.<br> - What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?<br> - I mean, sir, the seacocks.<br> - What are the seacocks?<br> - Seacock...<br> Oh, well, the seacocks<br> are the valves to drain out the boat,<br> and they're always kept<br> tight closed when you're afloat.<br> Yes?<br> Well, yesterday when I examined<br> that boat, I found they'd been opened.<br> - What could be the reason for that?<br> - Just this.<br> That's what flooded the boat<br> and sunk her.<br> - Are you implying...<br> - That boat never capsized at all.<br> I know it's a terrible<br> thing to say, sir,<br> but in my opinion,<br> she was scuttled.<br> - And there's them 'oles.<br> - What holes?<br> - In her planking.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Of course, that boat's been<br> underwater for over a year,<br> and the tide's been knocking her<br> against the ridge,<br> but it seemed to me the 'oles looked<br> as if she'd made 'em from the inside.<br> Then you believe she must have<br> done it deliberately?<br> Couldn't have been no accident,<br> not with her knowledge of boats.<br> You knew the former<br> Mrs. De Winter very well, I believe?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Would you believe<br> her capable of suicide?<br> No, frankly I would not,<br> but you never can tell.<br> You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.<br> Mr. De Winter, please.<br> I'm sorry to drag you back<br> for further questioning, Mr. De Winter.<br> You've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.<br> I wonder if you can help us in any way.<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Can you think of any reason<br> why there should be holes...<br> in the planking of the late<br> Mrs. De Winter's boat?<br> Well, of course I can't<br> think of any reason.<br> Has anyone ever discussed<br> these holes with you before?<br> Well, since the boat has been<br> at the bottom of the ocean,<br> I scarcely think that likely.<br> Mr. De Winter, I want you to believe<br> we all feel very deeply for you,<br> but I don't conduct this<br> inquiry for my own amusement.<br> - That's rather obvious, isn't it?<br> - I hope that it is.<br> Since Mrs. De Winter went<br> sailing alone, are we to believe<br> she drove those holes herself?<br> You may believe what you like.<br> Can you enlighten us as to why<br> Mrs. De Winter...<br> should have wanted<br> to end her own life?<br> I know of no reason whatever.<br> Mr. De Winter,<br> however painful it may be,<br> I have to ask you<br> a very personal question.<br> Were relations between you and the late<br> Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?<br> Were relations between you and the late<br> Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?<br> I won't stand this any longer!<br> And you might as well know now...<br> We'll adjourn till after lunch.<br> Mr. De Winter,<br> I presume you'll<br> be available for us then?<br> I told you you should<br> have had some breakfast.<br> You're hungry.<br> That's what's the matter with you.<br> Mr. Frith thought you might<br> like to have some lunch from<br> the house and sent me with it.<br> - Oh, that's fine, Mullen.<br> Can you pull around the corner?<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Awfully foolish of me<br> fainting like that.<br> Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted,<br> I'd have really lost my temper.<br> Darling, please be careful.<br> Darling, wait here a few moments.<br> - I'll see if I can find old Frank.<br> - Of course, darling.<br> - Don't worry about me.<br> I'll be all right.<br> - Sure? All right.<br> Here, have a spot of this.<br> Do you good.<br> Thank you.<br> - Sure you're all right?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - I won't be long.<br> - Right you are.<br> - Ugh.<br> - Hello.<br> And how does the bride<br> find herself today?<br> I say, marriage with Max is not exactly<br> a bed of roses, is it?<br> I think you'd better go<br> before Maxim gets back.<br> Oh, jealous, is he?<br> Well, I can't say I blame him.<br> But you don't think<br> I'm the Big Bad Wolf, do you?<br> I'm not, you know. I'm<br> a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.<br> And I think you're behaving<br> splendidly over all this.<br> Perfectly splendidly.<br> You know, you've grown up a bit<br> since I last saw you.<br> - It's no wonder.<br> - What do you want, Favell?<br> Oh, hello, Max. Things are going<br> pretty well for you, aren't they?<br> Better than you ever expected.<br> I was rather worried about you at first.<br> That's why I came down<br> to the inquest.<br> I'm touched by your solicitude,<br> but if you don't mind,<br> we'd rather like to have our lunch.<br> Lunch! I say, what a jolly idea!<br> Rather like a picnic, isn't it?<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Do you mind if I put this there?<br> You know, Max, old boy, I really think<br> I ought to talk things over with you.<br> Talk what things over?<br> Well, those holes in the planking,<br> for one thing.<br> Those holes that were drilled<br> from the inside.<br> - Oh, Mullen!<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Would you, like a good fellow,<br> have my car filled with petrol?<br> - It's almost empty.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - And Mullen, close the door, will you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Does this bother you?<br> You know, old boy,<br> I have a strong feeling...<br> that before the day is out,<br> somebody's going to make use of that...<br> rather expressive, though somewhat<br> old-fashioned term "foul play."<br> Am I boring you with all this?<br> No? Good.<br> Well, you see, Max, I find myself<br> in a rather awkward position.<br> You've only got to read this note<br> to understand. It's from Rebecca.<br> And what's more, she had the foresight<br> to put the date on it.<br> She wrote it to me<br> the day she died.<br> Incidentally,<br> I was out on a party on that night,<br> so I didn't get it<br> until the next day.<br> What makes you think that<br> note would interest me?<br> Oh, I'm not going to bother you<br> with the contents now,<br> but I can assure you that<br> it is not the note of a woman...<br> who intends to drown herself<br> that same night.<br> By the way,<br> what do you do with old bones?<br> Bury them, eh, what?<br> However, for the time being...<br> You know, Max, I'm getting awfully fed<br> up with my job as a motorcar salesman.<br> I don't know if you've ever<br> experienced the feeling...<br> of driving an expensive motorcar<br> which isn't your own.<br> But it can be<br> very, very exasperating.<br> You know what I mean.<br> You want to own the car yourself.<br> I've often wondered what it would be<br> like to retire to the country,<br> have a nice little place<br> with a few acres of shooting.<br> I've never figured out<br> what it would cost a year,<br> but I'd like to talk about it with you.<br> I'd like to have your advice on how<br> to live comfortably without hard work.<br> Hello, Favell.<br> You looking for me, Maxim?<br> Yes. Mr. Favell and I have a little<br> business transaction on hand.<br> I think we had better<br> conduct it over at the inn.<br> They may have<br> a private room there.<br> Well, see you later.<br> Find ColonelJulyan.<br> Tell him I want to see him immediately.<br> Come on, Favell. Let's go.<br> Have you a private room, please?<br> - Of course, sir. Through there, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.<br> Oh, it's splendid, splendid.<br> Exactly like the Ritz.<br> - Any orders, gents?<br> - Yes, you might bring me<br> a large brandy and soda.<br> How about you, Max? Have one on me.<br> I feel I can afford to play host.<br> - Thanks. I don't mind if I do.<br> - Make it two, will you, my good fellow?<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Where's Mr. De Winter?<br> Oh, through the other door, sir.<br> ColonelJulyan, his is Mr. Favell.<br> Oh, I know ColonelJulyan.<br> We're old friends, aren't we?<br> Since you're old friends, I assume you<br> also know he's head of the police here.<br> I think he might be interested<br> to hear your proposition.<br> Go on, tell him all about it.<br> I merely said I hoped to give up<br> selling cars and retire.<br> Actually, he offered to withhold<br> a vital piece of evidence...<br> if I made it worth his while.<br> I only want to see justice done,<br> Colonel.<br> Now, that boatbuilder's evidence...<br> suggested certain theories<br> concerning Rebecca's death.<br> One of them, of course, is suicide.<br> I have a little note here which puts<br> that possibility quite out of court.<br> - Read it, Colonel.<br> - "Jack, darling,<br> "I've just seen the doctor and I'm going<br> down to Manderley right away.<br> "I shall be at the cottage all evening<br> and shall leave the door open for you.<br> I have something terribly<br> important to tell you. Rebecca. "<br> Now, does that look like<br> the note of a woman who had made<br> up her mind to kill herself?<br> And apart from that, Colonel,<br> do you mean to tell me that<br> if you wanted to commit suicide,<br> you'd go to all the trouble<br> of putting out to sea in a boat,<br> then take a hammer and chisel<br> and laboriously knock holes<br> through the bottom of it?<br> Come, Colonel,<br> as an officer of the law,<br> don't you feel there are some<br> slight grounds for suspicion?<br> - Of murder?<br> - What else?<br> You've known Max a long time, so<br> you know he's the old-fashioned type...<br> who'd die to defend his honor<br> or who'd kill for it.<br> It's blackmail, pure and simple.<br> Blackmail's not so pure nor so simple.<br> It can bring a lot of trouble<br> to a great many people,<br> and the blackmailer sometimes finds<br> himself in jail at the end of it.<br> I see. You're going to hold<br> de Winter's hand through all this...<br> just because he's the big noise<br> around here and he's actually<br> permitted you to dine with him.<br> Be careful, Favell.<br> You've brought an accusation of murder.<br> - Have you any witnesses?<br> - I do have a witness.<br> - Oh.<br> - It's that fellow Ben.<br> If that stupid coroner<br> hadn't been a snob,<br> - he'd have seen that half-wit<br> was hiding something.<br> - And why should Ben do that?<br> Because we caught him once,<br> Rebecca and I, peering at us<br> through the cottage window.<br> Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.<br> That's why he was afraid to speak.<br> But he was always hanging about.<br> He must have seen this whole thing.<br> It's ridiculous<br> even listening to all this.<br> Ah. You're like a little trades union,<br> all of you, aren't you?<br> And if my guess is right, Crawley,<br> there's a bit of malice<br> in your soul toward me, isn't there?<br> Crawley didn't have<br> much success with Rebecca,<br> but he ought to have<br> more luck this time.<br> The bride will be grateful<br> for your fraternal arm, Crawley...<br> in a week or so.<br> - Every time she faints, in fact.<br> - De Winter!<br> - Maxim, please!<br> - De Winter!<br> That temper of yours<br> will do you in yet, Max.<br> Oh, uh, excuse me, gentlemen.<br> Now, is there anything else?<br> Yes. You might bring<br> Mr. De Winter a sedative.<br> - No, no, nothing at all. Just leave us.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Now, Favell,<br> let's get this business over.<br> As you seem to have worked out<br> the whole thing so carefully,<br> perhaps you can provide us<br> also with a motive?<br> I knew you were going<br> to bring that up, Colonel.<br> I've read enough detective stories to<br> know that there must always be a motive.<br> And if you'll all excuse me<br> for a moment, I'll supply that too.<br> I wish you would go home. You ought<br> not to be here through all this.<br> Please let me stay, Maxim.<br> Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're<br> not going to allow this fellow...<br> My opinion of Favell<br> is no higher than yours, Crawley.<br> But in my official capacity,<br> I have no alternative<br> but to pursue his accusation.<br> I entirely agree with you, Colonel.<br> In a manner so serious as this,<br> we must make sure...<br> of every point, explore every avenue,<br> and, in fact, if I may coin a phrase,<br> leave no stone unturned.<br> Ah, here she is... the missing link,<br> the witness who will help<br> supply the motive.<br> Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.<br> I believe you know everyone else.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - No offense, Colonel,<br> but I think I'll put this to Danny.<br> She'll understand it more easily.<br> Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?<br> Mrs. De Winter<br> always had Dr. McClean from the village.<br> Now, you heard.<br> I said Rebecca's doctor, in London.<br> I don't know anything about that.<br> Oh, don't give me that.<br> You knew everything about Rebecca.<br> You knew she was in love with me,<br> didn't you?<br> Surely you haven't forgotten<br> the good times she and I used<br> to have down at the cottage.<br> She had a right<br> to amuse herself, didn't she?<br> Love was a game to her.<br> It made her laugh, I tell you.<br> She used to sit on her bed and<br> rock with laughter at the lot of you.<br> Can you think of any reason why Mrs. De<br> Winter should have taken her own life?<br> No, no, I refuse to believe it.<br> I knew everything about her,<br> and I won't believe it.<br> There, you see? It's impossible.<br> She knows that as well as I do.<br> Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that<br> Rebecca went to a doctor in London.<br> - Who was it?<br> - I don't know.<br> Oh, I understand, Danny.<br> You think we're asking you<br> to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.<br> You're trying to defend her.<br> But that's what I'm doing.<br> I'm trying to clear her name<br> of the suspicion of suicide.<br> Mrs. Danvers,<br> it has been suggested...<br> Mrs. De Winter<br> was deliberately murdered.<br> There you have it<br> in a nutshell, Danny.<br> But there's one more thing you'll<br> want to know: The name of the murderer.<br> It's a lovely name that<br> rolls off the tongue so easily:<br> George Fortescue<br> Maximilian de Winter.<br> There was a doctor. Mrs. De Winter<br> sometimes went to him privately.<br> She used to go to him<br> even before she was married.<br> We don't want reminiscences, Danny.<br> What was his name?<br> Dr. Baker, 165 Goldhawk Road,<br> Shepherd's Bush.<br> There you are, Colonel.<br> There's where you'll find your motive.<br> Go and question Dr. Baker.<br> He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him...<br> to confirm the fact that<br> she was going to have a child,<br> a sweet, curly-headed<br> little child.<br> It isn't true. It isn't true.<br> She would have told me.<br> She told Max about it.<br> Maxim knew he wasn't the father.<br> So, like the gentleman of the old school<br> that he is, he killed her!<br> I'm afraid we shall have<br> to question this Dr. Baker.<br> Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,<br> I think I'd like to go along too.<br> Yes, unfortunately, I suppose<br> you have the right to ask that.<br> I'll see the coroner<br> and have the inquest postponed<br> pending further evidence.<br> I say, aren't you rather afraid that the<br> prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?<br> You have my word for it<br> that he will not do that.<br> Toodle-oo, Max.<br> Come along, Danny.<br> Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend<br> their last moments together alone.<br> Are you sure you don't want me<br> to go with you, Maxim?<br> No, darling.<br> It'll be very tiring for you.<br> I'll be back the very first<br> thing in the morning, and<br> I won't even stop to sleep.<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> - Ready, Maxim?<br> - Yes.<br> You two go on ahead.<br> I'll follow with Favell.<br> Dr. Baker, you may have seen Mr. De<br> Winter's name in the papers recently.<br> Oh, yes, yes. In connection<br> with a body that was found in a boat.<br> My wife was reading all about it.<br> A very sad case.<br> - My condolences...<br> - Oh, this is going to take hours.<br> Let me...<br> Don't bother, Favell.<br> I think I can tell Dr. Baker.<br> We're trying to discover<br> certain facts...<br> concerning the late Mrs. De Winter's<br> activities on the day of her death,<br> October 12, last year,<br> and I want you to tell me, if you can,<br> if anyone of that name<br> paid you a visit on that date.<br> I'm awfully sorry.<br> I'm afraid I can't help you.<br> I should have remembered<br> the name de Winter.<br> I've never attended<br> a Mrs. De Winter in my life.<br> Well, how can you possibly tell<br> all your patients' names?<br> I can look it up<br> in my engagement diary if you like.<br> - Did you say the 12th of October?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, here we are.<br> No, no de Winter.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Well, here are all<br> the appointments for that day.<br> "Ross, Campbell, Steadall,<br> Perrino, Danvers, Mathews..."<br> Danny! What the devil!<br> Would you read that name again?<br> Did you say Danvers?<br> Yes, I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.<br> What did she look like?<br> Can you remember?<br> Yes, I remember her quite well.<br> She was a very beautiful woman...<br> tall, dark,<br> exquisitely dressed.<br> - Rebecca.<br> - The lady must<br> have used an assumed name.<br> Is that so? This is a surprise.<br> I'd known her a long time.<br> What was the matter with her?<br> My dear sir,<br> there are certain ethics.<br> Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,<br> for Mrs. De Winter's suicide?<br> For her murder, you mean. She was<br> going to have a kid, wasn't she?<br> Come on, out with it!<br> Tell me what else a woman of her class<br> be doing in a dump like this?<br> I take it the official nature of this<br> visit makes it necessary for me to...<br> I assure you we'd not be troubling you<br> if it were not necessary.<br> You want to know<br> if I can suggest any motive...<br> as to why Mrs. De Winter<br> should have taken her life?<br> Yes, I think I can.<br> The woman who called herself<br> Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.<br> She was not<br> going to have a child?<br> That was what she thought,<br> but my diagnosis was different.<br> I sent her to a well-known specialist<br> for an examination and X-rays,<br> and on this date she returned<br> to me for his report.<br> I remember her standing here<br> holding out her hand for the photograph.<br> "I want to know the truth,"<br> she said.<br> "I don't want soft words<br> and a bedside manner.<br> If I'm for it,<br> you can tell me right away."<br> I knew she was not the type<br> to accept a lie.<br> She'd asked for the truth,<br> so I let her have it.<br> She thanked me and I never<br> saw her again, so I assumed that...<br> - What was wrong with her?<br> - Cancer.<br> Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.<br> An operation would have been<br> no earthly use at all.<br> In a short time,<br> she would have been under morphia.<br> There was nothing that could<br> be done for her, except wait.<br> Did she say anything when you told her?<br> She smiled<br> in a queer sort of way.<br> Your wife was a wonderful woman,<br> Mr. De Winter.<br> And, oh yes,<br> I remember she said something...<br> that struck me as being<br> very peculiar at the time.<br> When I told her<br> it was a matter of months,<br> she said,<br> "Oh, no, Doctor, not that long."<br> You've been very kind.<br> You've told us all we wanted to know.<br> We shall probably need<br> an official verification.<br> - Verification?<br> - Yes, to confirm the verdict of suicide.<br> I understand. Can I<br> offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?<br> No, very kind.<br> I think we ought to be going.<br> Thank heaven we know the truth.<br> Dreadful thing, dreadful.<br> Ayoung and lovely woman like her.<br> No wonder...<br> I never had the remotest idea.<br> Neither did Danny, I'm sure.<br> I wish I had a drink.<br> Will we be needed at the inquest<br> any further, ColonelJulyan?<br> Oh, no. I can see to it that Maxim<br> is not troubled any further.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Are you ready to start, Colonel?<br> No, thank you.<br> I'm staying in town tonight.<br> And let me tell you, Favell,<br> blackmail is not much of a profession,<br> and we know how to deal with it<br> in our part of the worid,<br> strange as it may seem to you.<br> I'm sure I don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> But if you ever need a new car,<br> Colonel, just let me know.<br> It's impossible to thank you for your<br> kindness to us through all this.<br> - You know what I feel<br> without my saying anything.<br> - Not at all.<br> Better let your wife know.<br> She'll be getting worried.<br> Yes, I'll phone her at once, then<br> we'll get straight down to Manderley.<br> Good-bye, Crawley.<br> Maxim's got a great friend.<br> - Frank.<br> - Yes, Maxim?<br> There's something you don't know.<br> Oh, no, there isn't.<br> I didn't kill her, Frank.<br> But I know now that when<br> she told me about the child,<br> she wanted me to kill her.<br> She lied on purpose.<br> She foresaw the whole thing.<br> That's why she stood there<br> laughing when she...<br> Don't think about it anymore.<br> Thank you, Frank.<br> Hello, Danny?<br> I just wanted to tell you the news.<br> Rebecca held out on both of us.<br> She had cancer.<br> Yes, suicide.<br> And now Max and that<br> dear little bride of his...<br> will be able to stay on at Manderley<br> and live happily ever after.<br> Bye-bye, Danny.<br> - Is this your car, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> Will you be going soon?<br> This isn't a parking place, you know.<br> Oh, isn't it?<br> People are entitled...<br> to leave their cars<br> outside if they want to.<br> It's a pity some of you fellows<br> haven't anything better to do.<br> When you phoned,<br> did she say she'd wait up?<br> I asked her to go to bed,<br> but she wouldn't hear of it.<br> I wish I could get some<br> more speed out of this thing.<br> Is something worrying you, Maxim?<br> I can't get over the feeling<br> something's wrong.<br> - Frank!<br> - What's the matter? Why did we stop?<br> What's the time?<br> Oh, this clock's wrong.<br> It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?<br> That can't be the dawn<br> breaking over there.<br> It's in the winter that<br> you see the Northern Lights, isn't it?<br> That's not the Northern Lights.<br> That's Manderley!<br> Frith! Frith!<br> Mrs. De Winter. Where is she?<br> - I thought I saw her, sir.<br> - Where?<br> Maxim.<br> Thank heaven<br> you've come back to me.<br> - Are you all right, darling?<br> Are you all right?<br> - Oh, yes, I'm all right.<br> Mrs. Danvers. She's gone mad.<br> She said she'd rather destroy Manderley<br> than see us happy here.<br> Look! The west wing!<br>
