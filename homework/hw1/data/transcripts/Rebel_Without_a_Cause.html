Do you<br> have to slam the door in my face?<br> I try to get to him. What happens?<br> I buy you everything you want.<br> A bicycle? You get it!<br> - A car...<br> - You buy me many things.<br> Not just buying!<br> We give you love and affection, don't we?<br> Then what is it?<br> Was it because we went to that party?<br> You know what kind of drunken brawls<br> those kind of parties turn into.<br> It's no place for kids!<br> A minute ago,<br> you said you didn't care if he drinks.<br> He said a "little" drink.<br> You're tearing me apart!<br> You say one thing, he says another,<br> and everybody changes back again!<br> That's a fine way to behave!<br> Well, you know who he takes after.<br> Inside, Jim.<br> Come on.<br> Inside.<br> - Excuse us a minute.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Somebody ought to put poison<br> in her Epsom salts.<br> Grandma?<br> Get lost.<br> Hang loose, boy.

I'll hit somebody.<br> I'll do something, and I don't...<br> Try the desk.<br> Go ahead.<br> Is that why you moved?<br> You were in trouble?<br> No, they think...<br> ...that they can protect me<br> by moving around all the time.<br> You had a good start in the wrong<br> direction. Why'd you do it?<br> What do you mean?<br> Mess a kid up?<br> He called me chicken.<br> Your folks didn't understand?<br> They never do.<br> They think that I can make friends...<br> ...if we move.<br> Just move. Everything<br> will be roses and sunshine.<br> But you don't think<br> that's the right solution?<br> She eats him alive and he takes it.<br> Things pretty rough for you at home?<br> That's a zoo!<br> What?<br> That's a zoo!<br> I mean, he always wants to be my pal,<br> you know?<br> But how can I give him anything if he's...<br> I mean, I love him and all that type of stuff.<br> I don't want to hurt him.<br> But then I don't know what to do anymore.<br> Except maybe die.<br> If he had guts to knock Mom cold once...<br> ...then maybe she'd be happy<br> and she'd stop picking on him.<br> Because they make mush out of him!<br> You know, just mush!<br> I'll tell you one thing,<br> I don't ever want to be like him.<br> Chicken?<br> I'll bet you see right through me,<br> don't you?<br> How can a guy grow up<br> in a circus like that?<br> Beats me, Jim.<br> But they do.<br> Want some water?<br> If I had one day...<br> ...when I didn't have to be all confused...<br> ...and I didn't have to feel<br> that I was ashamed of everything...<br> If I felt that I belonged someplace...<br> You know? Then...<br> Will you do something for me?<br> If the pot starts boiling again,<br> will you see me before you get in a jam?<br> If you want to talk,<br> come in and shoot the breeze.<br> It's easier sometimes<br> than talking to your folks.<br> Anytime, night or day.<br> You calmed down enough<br> to go back in there now?<br> Are you serious?<br> Mother, I'm sorry.<br> It's all right, darling.<br> Mister Officer...<br> ...this was all very unfortunate.<br> He made a mistake, and he's sorry,<br> so we won't have any more trouble.<br> He was always a lovely boy.<br> Grandmother, you tell one more lie<br> and you'll turn to stone.<br> Look, Jim...<br> ...don't forget.<br> Have some cigars?<br> No, thanks. I don't smoke.<br> Give them to your friends.<br> No, thanks, Mr. Stark.<br> Frank, he doesn't want any.<br> Jim, your eggs are on the table, dear.<br> Sit down. Eat. You'll be late.<br> Beau!<br> Come here, Beau!<br> Beau, come on!<br> I don't think I want anything.<br> I'm nervous.<br> My first day of school,<br> Mother made me eat so much...<br> ...I couldn't swallow until recess.<br> Did you fix any sandwiches?<br> There's meatloaf and peanut butter...<br> What did I tell you? Peanut butter.<br> There's a thermos of orange juice...<br> ...and some applesauce cake to go with it.<br> And I baked it.<br> Goodbye, Mom.<br> Young fellow, you knock them dead<br> like your old man used to.<br> You know what I think?<br> I feel maybe we'll stay here awhile.<br> Listen, watch out<br> about choosing your pals.<br> Don't let them choose you.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I've seen you before.<br> - Stop the world!<br> - You don't have to be unfriendly.<br> Well, now that's true.<br> But life is crushing in on me.<br> Life can be beautiful.<br> - I know where it was.<br> - Where what was?<br> Where I first saw you.<br> Everything going okay now?<br> You live here, don't you?<br> Who lives?<br> Hey, where's Dawson High?<br> At University and Tenth.<br> Thanks.<br> You want to carry my books?<br> I got my car. You want to go with me?<br> I go with the kids.<br> I'll bet.<br> All right.<br> You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo.<br> I love you too.<br> What's that?<br> - That's a new disease.<br> - Friend of yours?<br> - Glad they let you out.<br> - Nobody chickened.<br> - You're lucky he lived.<br> - They always live.<br> Man, I'm living!<br> Hey, which way to University and Tenth?<br> Which way is it to University and Tenth?<br> - It's that way!<br> - No, it's that way!<br> Hey, watch it!<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> You stepped on the school insignia.<br> Nobody does that, ever!<br> I'm sorry. It's my first day here...<br> ...and nobody told me about it.<br> - I'm very sorry.<br> - It's okay.<br> Know where to report?<br> Mr. Bassett.<br> Room 208. He'll show you where to go.<br> I'm sorry about that.<br> Just watch it next time.<br> ...and immensity of our universe.<br> For many days<br> before the end of our Earth...<br> ...people will look<br> into the night sky and notice a star...<br> ...increasingly bright and increasingly near.<br> As this star approaches us...<br> Jim Stark.<br> I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.<br> As this star approaches us,<br> the weather will change.<br> The great polar fields of the north<br> and south will rot and divide.<br> And the seas will turn warmer.<br> The last of us search the heavens<br> and stand amazed.<br> For the stars will still be there...<br> ...moving through their ancient rhythms.<br> The familiar constellations<br> that illuminate our night...<br> ...will seem as they have always seemed:<br> Eternal, unchanged and little moved...<br> ...by the shortness of time<br> between our planet's birth and demise.<br> Orion, the hunter.<br> One of Ptolemy's constellations...<br> ...and the most brilliant in the heavens.<br> Boy!<br> What?<br> I was just thinking that...<br> ...once you've been up there<br> you know you been some place.<br> Gesundheit!<br> They're almost equal in brilliancy.<br> Cancer, the crab...<br> ...containing a large, loose cluster of stars,<br> called Praesepe or the Beehive.<br> I'm a crab!<br> The sun can be vertically overhead.<br> Taurus, the bull.<br> That's real funny.<br> A comedian, Buzz.<br> He's cute. I bet he's real rough too.<br> I bet he fights cows.<br> You shouldn't monkey with him.<br> - He's a wheel.<br> - Who?<br> Buzz.<br> So is she.<br> It's hard to make friends with these guys.<br> I don't want to make friends.<br> And while the flash of our beginning...<br> ...has not yet traveled<br> the light years into distance...<br> ...has not yet been seen by planets<br> deep within the other galaxies...<br> ...we will disappear into the blackness<br> of the space from which we came...<br> ...destroyed as we began,<br> in a burst of gas and fire.<br> The heavens are still and cold once more.<br> In all the immensity of our universe<br> and the galaxies beyond...<br> ...the Earth will not be missed.<br> Through the infinite reaches of space...<br> ...the problems of man seem<br> trivial and naive indeed.<br> And man, existing alone...<br> ...seems himself an episode<br> of little consequence.<br> That's all.<br> Thank you for your attention.<br> Thank you very much.<br> May I have your attention?<br> May I please have your attention?<br> Classes will meet at the busses outside.<br> May I have your attention?<br> May I have your attention?<br> Oh, what the heck!<br> It's all over. The world ended.<br> What does he know about man alone?<br> Certainly is a lot of switches.<br> Yeah, quite intricate.<br> - Hey, what's for kicks?<br> - What do you say, Buzz?<br> Well, what do you want to do?<br> - How about Moo?<br> - You mean the guy in there?<br> - The comedian.<br> - What do you say?<br> All right! What do you want to do?<br> Let's bring him down.<br> He'd make a good pigeon.<br> - What's the funny guy doing?<br> - The guy in back of us, Buzz.<br> He ought to have his wardrobe<br> cleaned and burned.<br> - All right, Moo.<br> - All right.<br> - What will we do with him?<br> - Don't worry.<br> I'll figure out what we'll do with him.<br> Relax. He'll figure it out.<br> What are you looking at?<br> Nothing.<br> I told you not to fool with those guys.<br> Now they're laying for you.<br> If you don't want trouble,<br> I know where we can go.<br> It's a big mansion.<br> There it is.<br> We could sneak around<br> and they wouldn't know.<br> - Who lives there?<br> - Nobody lives there.<br> Come on, let's go!<br> There he is.<br> That's his car.<br> Relax, man.<br> - You know something?<br> - No, what?<br> You read too many comic books.<br> Well, he's real abstract! He's different.<br> That's right.<br> I'm cute too.<br> Is that meaning me?<br> - Is that meaning me?<br> - What?<br> Chicken!<br> Yes.<br> You shouldn't call me that.<br> How about you?<br> Are you always at ringside?<br> What are you hanging around<br> such rank company for?<br> What?<br> I don't want any trouble.<br> The blade game, Buzz?<br> I thought only punks fought with knives.<br> Who's fighting?<br> No fighting. It's examination time, man.<br> It's a crazy game.<br> Get him a knife.<br> Give it to him.<br> Come on, give him a knife.<br> - Pick it up!<br> - I don't want any trouble.<br> Pick it up!<br> Pick it up!<br> Now, you understand the action?<br> There's no sticking.<br> Crunch?<br> Just...<br> ...a little jabbing. That's all.<br> What's the matter?<br> What's the matter?<br> What're you waiting on, toreador?<br> I thought you wanted a little action.<br> - Are you crumb chicken or...<br> - Don't call me that!<br> Toro!<br> Cut off a button and<br> you get to join the club.<br> Oh, that's close!<br> Look out, Buzz!

I'd like to change the subject.<br> Why?<br> I'd just like to, that's all!<br> Girls your age don't do things like that!<br> You need an explanation?<br> Hi, rascal!<br> Girls don't love their father?<br> Since when?<br> Since I got to be 16?<br> Stop that! Sit down!<br> May I please be excused?<br> Hey, glamour puss!<br> I'm sorry.

I need one.<br> Listen, Jimbo, I'm just trying<br> to show you how foolish you are.<br> When you're older,<br> you'll look back at this...<br> ...and you'll laugh at yourself...<br> ...for thinking that this is so important.<br> It's not as if you were alone.<br> This has happened to every boy.<br> It happened to me when I was your age,<br> maybe a year older.<br> What's all the excitement?<br> I've been working hard<br> getting this house in order...<br> Jim had blood on him.<br> - He just ran out.<br> - And you didn't stop him?<br> Hey, Chicken Little!<br> Where's toreador?

Do you enjoy<br> doing this to me, or what?<br> - You wanted him to make a list!<br> - Let him tell it!<br> She doesn't care!<br> You remember how I almost died<br> giving birth to him?<br> - And then you say I don't care!<br> - Please relax, relax!<br> Dad...<br> ...I said it was a matter of honor.<br> Remember?<br> They called me chicken.<br> You know? Chicken?<br> I had to go.<br> If I didn't, I'd never be able<br> to face those kids again.<br> I got in one of those cars...<br> ...and Buzz, one of those kids,<br> he got in the other car...<br> ...and we had to drive fast...<br> ...and then jump before the car<br> came to the edge.<br> And I got out okay and Buzz didn't.<br> And it killed him.<br> I can't keep it to myself anymore.<br> You just get it off your chest.<br> That is not what I mean!<br> I have never done anything right.<br> I've been going around with<br> my head in a sling for years.<br> I don't want to drag you into this,<br> but I can't help it.<br> You see, I think...<br> ...you can't just go around proving<br> things and pretending like you're tough.<br> That's right.<br> And even though you got to<br> look a certain way...<br> - You're absolutely right!<br> - You look, you feel...<br> You're not listening to me!<br> You're involved in this, just like I am!<br> I'm going to the police<br> and telling them I'm involved.<br> Did anyone see you?<br> - Did anyone see your license plate?<br> - I don't know!<br> Will the others go to the police?<br> It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.<br> - Why be the only one involved?<br> - Far be it from me...<br> Do we have to listen to a sermon now?<br> I'm telling him what you mean.<br> You can't be idealistic all your life.<br> Nobody thanks you for...<br> - Except to yourself!<br> - Wait a minute!<br> Except yourself.<br> You don't want me to go?<br> No, I don't want you to go to the police.<br> Why should you be the only one involved?<br> But I am involved! We are all involved!<br> A boy, a kid was killed tonight!<br> I can't get out of it and<br> pretend it didn't happen!<br> Well, you know<br> that you did the wrong thing.<br> - That's the main thing.<br> - That's nothing.<br> That is absolutely nothing. Dad, you said...<br> ...you want me to tell the truth.<br> Didn't you say that?<br> You can't turn it off.<br> He's not saying that.<br> He's saying just don't volunteer!<br> Just tell a little white lie.<br> You'll learn! When you're older, Jim.<br> Well, I don't think<br> that I want to learn that way.<br> It doesn't matter anyway,<br> because we're moving!<br> Don't tear me loose again.<br> - Just why are we moving?<br> - Must I spell it out?<br> - You won't use me as an excuse again!<br> - I don't!<br> When you can't face yourself<br> you blame me!<br> That is not true!<br> You say it's because of me<br> or the neighborhood!<br> You use every other phony excuse!<br> Mom, I just...<br> Once, I want to do something right!<br> And I don't want you<br> to run away from me again!<br> - This is all going too fast.<br> - You better give me something.<br> You better give me something fast.<br> Jimmy, you're very young.<br> A foolish decision now<br> could wreck your whole life!<br> - In ten years you won't know it happened.<br> - Dad, answer her.<br> Tell her.<br> Ten years.<br> Dad, let me hear you answer her.<br> Dad, stand up for me.<br> Stand up!<br> You'll kill him!<br> You're killing him!<br> You want to kill your own father?<br> - See how they brought us in like that?<br> - Let go of me!<br> You want a good crack in the mouth?<br> Take it easy, Ed.
