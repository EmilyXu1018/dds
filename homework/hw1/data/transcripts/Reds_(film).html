                        Was that in 1913 or 17?<br> I can't remember now.<br> I'm beginning to forget<br> all the people that I used to know, see?<br> Do I remember Louise Bryant?<br> Why, of course.<br> I couldn't forget her if I tried.<br> I can't...<br> I might sort of scratch my memory,<br> but not at the moment.<br> You know, things go<br> and come back again.<br> It was Christopher Street,<br> and I was thinking about<br> another street down there instead,<br> until it came back<br> that it was Christopher Street.<br> Sometimes I have lapses like that.<br> I'd forgotten all about them.<br> Were they socialists?<br> I guess they must've been,<br> but I don't think they were<br> of any importance.<br> I don't remember them at all.<br> I know that Jack went around<br> with Mabel Dodge,<br> and then he went around<br> with another gal,<br> and then he went around<br> with Louise Bryant.<br> I know there were shifts back and forth,<br> but it never occurred to me...<br> It never impinged on<br> my own personal life.<br> I like baseball.<br> I don't know what<br> the outside world thought of them.<br> But they were a couple.<br> I mean, you always spoke of<br> Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.<br> I recall his telling me<br> that he had two ambitions<br> when he came to college.<br> One was to be elected<br> president of his class.<br> He didn't know anyone in the class.<br> No one knew him.<br> The other was to make a million dollars<br> by the time he was 25.<br> Now, my idea about Jack Reed<br> is probably different from most.<br> But I knew him well.<br> I knew he was a man of strong views.<br> I knew he was independent.<br> And I have an idea,<br> I may be wrong of this,<br> that his wife was a Communist<br> and that his wife had influenced him,<br> as any wife does,<br> as you know and I know.<br> Louise Bryant?<br> Well, I thought she was something<br> of an exhibitionist.<br> No, I'm not gonna talk about people.<br> Don't fool yourself.<br> No, sir. I'm not... I'm not<br> a purveyor of neighborhood gossip,<br> or anything of the kind.<br> That's not my job.<br> He was quiet.<br> He was a nice fellow.<br> I would say, if I met him,<br> I would say he was a nice fellow.<br> He was, however, a fighting fellow<br> in regards to principles.<br> I said, I think,<br> that a guy who's always interested<br> in the condition of the world<br> and changing it<br> either has no problems of his own<br> or refuses to face them.<br> Jack...<br> Well, I wouldn't call him a playboy,<br> but some people did.<br> Jack Reed's life, short as it was,<br> happened at a time,<br> and all of us, after all,<br> are the victims of our time and place,<br> when he had the opportunity,<br> as a reporter,<br> to be in some very exciting<br> and dramatic places.<br> It isn't everybody can<br> be buried in the Kremlin,<br> and he's the only American.<br> Born in Portland, Oregon.<br> Now, isn't that something?<br> - What's he hugging?<br> - A statue.<br> Well, I can see that.<br> But what's it a statue of?<br> It's just a statue, Mr. Woodward.<br> - How much is it?<br> - It's $75.<br> - For a photograph?<br> - That's right, Mrs. Rudisile.<br> This is interesting, Mrs. Trullinger.<br> Not that it isn't very nice,<br> but it isn't a painting.<br> Mr. Woodward,<br> I'd like you to look at this.<br> - I think I see the intention here.<br> - Yes.<br> Eve dominates, you see?<br> The dream dominates the dreamer.<br> It's...<br> It looks blurry to me.<br> The other one looked blurry, too.<br> I think that's the intention<br> of the photographer, Mr. Woodward.<br> What? To be blurry?<br> But perhaps if you looked at it<br> from a different point of view...<br> Louise!<br> This is you?<br> Lovely figure.<br> Louise, have you taken<br> leave of your senses?<br> Don't be a fool, Paul.<br> You think I'm a fool<br> because I object to my wife<br> being displayed naked in front<br> of half the people I know...<br> Yes. My God,<br> it's a work of art in a gallery.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You used to call Portland<br> a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind.<br> It may be stuffy and provincial,<br> but it also happens<br> to be a coffin where I earn a living.<br> You can take your living<br> and fill up teeth with it,<br> because I can earn my own living.<br> I have my work.<br> You consider a few articles in<br> The Oregonian and The Gazette work?<br> No, I'll tell you<br> what your work is, Louise.<br> It's making yourself<br> the center of attention.<br> It's shocking Louise Trullinger,<br> emancipated woman of Portland.<br> Now, we're gonna say good night<br> to these people and go home.<br> - I'm going to the Liberal Club.<br> - You're not going to the Liberal Club.<br> - I'm going to the Liberal Club, Paul.<br> - No, you're not...<br> It's very nice, Mrs. Trullinger. All of it.<br> It's very gratifying to hear,<br> isn't it, Louise?<br> Isn't it, Louise?<br> Of course, you know<br> who is going to be at the Liberal Club.<br> Patriotic Americans believe in freedom.<br> And unless we are willing to take arms<br> to defend our heritage,<br> we cannot call ourselves<br> patriotic Americans!<br> I'm proud to be free.<br> I'm proud to be an American.<br> And if the man<br> we elected President decides<br> that our freedoms are being threatened<br> and that the world must<br> be made safe for democracy,<br> then I know I won't be alone<br> in heeding the call of patriotism!<br> What is this war about?<br> Each man will have his own answer.<br> I have mine. I'm ready to be called!<br> Now, tonight we have with us<br> the son of Margaret<br> and the late C.J. Reed of Portland,<br> who has witnessed this war first-hand.<br> And I, for one, see no reason<br> why we here at the Liberal Club<br> shouldn't listen to what<br> Jack Reed has to say.<br> What would you say<br> this war is about, Jack Reed?<br> Profits.<br> What did he say?<br> Excuse me, Mr. Reed.<br> Hello, my name is Louise Bryant<br> and I am a journalist.<br> And I was wondering if you might<br> have time to give me an interview.<br> I'm sorry, I don't. I don't do interviews.<br> I had a piece in the Blast not long ago.<br> - Berkman's Blast? Really?<br> - That's right.<br> Well, when did you want<br> to do this interview?<br> Now.<br> I don't live here.<br> - I live in a house by the river.<br> - Oh, really.<br> My, my, my. Two places.<br> Yeah, I use this place as a studio.<br> Do you like white lilies?<br> They're my favorite flowers.<br> - You're not married, are you?<br> - No, I don't think I believe in marriage.<br> - Are you married?<br> - Marriage?<br> How could anyone believe in marriage?<br> I bet your mother's glad<br> to see you back in Portland.<br> Just glad when I'm not in jail.<br> Is this you?<br> Yes. Do you like it?<br> Yeah. I think they're...<br> - A little blurry, but this one's very nice.<br> - Yes.<br> It is. Now...<br> Granted, the profit motive<br> in the world economy<br> is a basic root cause for the war.<br> Do you feel that those<br> Americans who are pro-war<br> and who ascribe their motives<br> to patriotism are cynical or naive?<br> And, if they're cynical,<br> is it the cynicism of patriots<br> who feel that without a profit motive,<br> the power structure elite of this country<br> will not enter the war,<br> even though they feel<br> that the containment<br> of German militarism<br> may be necessary for...<br> All right, Miss Bryant, do you want<br> an interview? Write this down.<br> Are you naive enough to think<br> containing German militarism<br> has anything to do with this war?<br> Don't you understand that England<br> and France own the world economy<br> and Germany just wants a piece of it?<br> Keep writing, Miss Bryant.<br> Miss Bryant, can't you grasp<br> that J.P. Morgan<br> has loaned England and France<br> a billion dollars?<br> And if Germany wins,<br> he won't get it back.<br> More coffee?<br> America would be entering the war<br> to protect J.P. Morgan's money.<br> If he loses it, we'll have a depression.<br> So, the real question is,<br> why do we have an economy<br> where the poor have to pay<br> so the rich won't lose money?<br> All right, now, what haven't we covered?<br> Economic freedom for women<br> means sexual freedom,<br> and sexual freedom<br> means birth control...<br> Dissent! The Masses stands for dissent.<br> ...we have a predominantly<br> upper-middle class readership.<br> So, we have to run around the country<br> raising money for the magazine<br> any way we...<br> What?<br> Well, I'm thinking that I guess I...<br> That I ought to offer you more coffee.<br> I hadn't realized the hour, but<br> I seem to have taken up<br> a lot of your time.<br> Well, that's okay by me.<br> Does this happen to you often?<br> Not often enough.<br> Well?<br> We certainly have come a long way fast.<br> Yeah.<br> Do you want to take it a step further?<br> Yeah.<br> What would you think if I asked you<br> to do something<br> that might seem a little selfish?<br> Well, I... I think you should.<br> Good. Good, because I'd like you<br> to take a look at my work<br> and tell me what you think.<br> You see, I really respect<br> your opinion so much.<br> Well, it's odd,<br> because I was just gonna ask you<br> if you had anything<br> I could take a look at.<br> I know it's an imposition<br> but I'd be very grateful and you see,<br> I've read everything<br> that you've ever written.<br> Well, I'd be happy to do it. So, that's...<br> Well, thank you.<br> Well, then I... I'll get your coat.<br> Oh, and I hope you won't<br> be gentle with me.<br> - Gentle?<br> - I'm a serious writer.<br> You can really be tough.<br> No, I will be. No, I will be.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Do you want me to leave?<br> - Not really, but I'm late.<br> - Late at 6:00 in the morning?<br> - Yes. I have an appointment.<br> Well, could I see you tomorrow night?<br> I'm busy tomorrow night.<br> - Because I'm leaving town the next day.<br> - Gee, I'm sorry.<br> So, if you have time,<br> let me know what you think,<br> and I'll send you a copy of the interview.<br> Some interview, huh?<br> Take a look sometime.<br> Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Jack, dear,<br> do you remember Mr. Hardison?<br> Used to be at the First Presbyterian<br> Church, up the hill.<br> He's in Seattle now<br> at the big Plymouth church.<br> What brings you out here, Jack?<br> Just come out to see your mother?<br> Mr. Partlow, I just... I'm raising money<br> for this magazine that I write for.<br> - What?<br> - I say, I'm raising money<br> for this magazine that I write for!<br> - Magazine? What magazine?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Well, it's called The Masses.<br> - The what?<br> - The Masses!<br> - The Masses.<br> - Masses.<br> Jack, do you remember<br> Mr. Potterson's sister?<br> The one with the bad arm?<br> - Is that religious?<br> - Oh, no, sir. No, sir.<br> Oh, you remember her, Jack.<br> Her name was Miriam.<br> She didn't eat meat.<br> Sounds religious.<br> You remember the fellow<br> that was courting her?<br> Sold spool thread.<br> Came from down around Eugene.<br> - Not religious, huh?<br> - No, sir.<br> - What was his name, Jack?<br> - I don't think I remember the name.<br> Well, I don't know about you people,<br> but I'm starved.<br> I don't know, Mrs. Partlow. I...<br> Jack, I heard you made a few people<br> a little unhappy<br> down at the Liberal Club last night.<br> Oh, Carl,<br> we're here to have a good time,<br> let's not go into that.<br> What was his name, Jack?<br> - Here you are!<br> - I can't...<br> Welcome. So happy...<br> - Hello, Jack.<br> - Hello.<br> Oh, you look wonderful.<br> Alma, this is Louise Trullinger.<br> Alma Boyle.<br> This is Ned Boyle and Jack Reed.<br> Jack, Louise is quite a progressive<br> in her own right.<br> Mr. Partlow.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Reed?<br> - How do you do?<br> Oh, Mr. Partlow, Mrs. Partlow,<br> this is Louise Trullinger.<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> Are you Paul Trullinger's wife?<br> Yes. Yes, I am.<br> Well, isn't that something?<br> He did Frank Rhodes' bridge.<br> Oh, Mrs. Trullinger, your husband's<br> the finest dentist in all of Portland.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Really?<br> And I think he did a plate<br> for Uncle Grover.<br> Oh, we won't wait for Harry and Martha.<br> I could eat a horse.<br> All right, let's go in.<br> What a shame Paul<br> couldn't come tonight.<br> - An emergency?<br> - Yes...<br> Not Uncle Grover's plate, I hope.<br> - No. Uncle Grover's plate's like new.<br> - Oh, well...<br> Did free love start<br> in Greenwich Village?<br> Very good wine, Carl.<br> - More, Jack?<br> - No, no. No, thank you.<br> It's just delicious, really.<br> Don't you think so, Mrs. Trullinger?<br> Yes, it's just delicious.<br> Thank you, Louise.<br> - Dupont, I think.<br> - Dupont.<br> It is Dupont, isn't it, Harry?<br> Mother doesn't want you to get Jack<br> started on the subject of marriage.<br> You got any children, Mrs. Trullinger?<br> Not yet, Mr. Reed.<br> - Call me Jack.<br> - I've been married 14 years now.<br> Don't get me in any arguments<br> about free love.<br> It's getting cold outside.<br> I'll just call you Louise.<br> George Waldorf.<br> That's it! George Waldorf!<br> Used to sell spool thread.<br> - What about George Waldorf?<br> - Well, he died.<br> I couldn't think of letting<br> you walk unescorted, Louise.<br> Tell me something.<br> Does Dr. Trullinger mind your<br> spending so much time at your studio?<br> People have to give each other<br> a little freedom.<br> Freedom, Mrs. Trullinger?<br> I'd like to know<br> what your idea of freedom is.<br> Having your own studio? Walk...<br> I'd like to see you<br> with your pants off, Mr. Reed.<br> Marching and shuffling along<br> I didn't realize the time.<br> So, if you like, there's some<br> very nice damson preserves.<br> And you can make toast out of that,<br> if you want.<br> So, bye.<br> Where you going?<br> Where you going?<br> If you're catching the 2:45, I mean,<br> you don't really have that much time.<br> - I'm sure you're gonna want to pack...<br> - Louise, it's 8:45, only.<br> It's 8:45.<br> Listen, I realize<br> that you're very busy in New York,<br> but I'd be grateful<br> if you could take the time<br> to write a few words to me<br> about my work.<br> Oh, yes. Oh, yes.<br> If you'll just send my portfolio back.<br> You can mail it to this address...<br> Louise, wait a minute. What are you<br> just walking out like that for?<br> Will you come upstairs, please,<br> and just talk to me for a minute?<br> Thank you.<br> - Listen...<br> - What is it?<br> Why don't you come?<br> - What?<br> - Come to New York.<br> You wanna write?<br> Come where the writers are.<br> If you wanna have freedom you gotta go<br> where the freedom is, don't you?<br> You're gonna go to waste in Portland.<br> Come to New York.<br> - You ought to be in New York.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> I'll remember that.<br> - What?<br> - I'll remember your advice.<br> Please come with me.<br> All right, wait a minute.<br> Let me get this straight.<br> You want me<br> to come with you to New York.<br> Yeah.<br> What as?

Your girlfriend,<br> your mistress, your paramour,<br> your concubine?<br> Why does it have to be as anything?<br> Because I don't wanna<br> get into some kind<br> of emotional possessive involvement<br> where I'm not able to...<br> I want to know what as.<br> Well, it's nearly Thanksgiving.<br> Why don't you come as a turkey?<br> I always thought she was<br> a very earnest girl who went away.<br> Probably the dentist knew nothing<br> except about teeth,<br> and was mainly interested...<br> And then she had<br> this wonderful journalist<br> who could talk about all sorts of things.<br> I had a coat I brought from Germany.<br> And she wanted that coat<br> and made me all kinds of propositions.<br> But I wanted it, too.<br> But finally I gave in and gave it to her.<br> I had other coats.<br> So that's how she operated.<br> She went after him.<br> As I say, she got him.<br> So she wasn't any dummy.<br> But it was something to happen<br> in little old Portland.<br> You didn't hear the word "sex."<br> You didn't hear the word "lesbian."<br> You didn't hear the word "homosexual."<br> You didn't hear the word "abortion."<br> You didn't hear those things.<br> Men respected women.<br> They helped them on with their coats,<br> they opened the doors for them.<br> And the man and woman<br> who courted each other,<br> they married each other.<br> You know something that I think,<br> that there was just as much<br> fucking going on then as now.<br> Only now,<br> it has a more perverted quality.<br> Now there's no love whatever included.<br> Then, there was your heart,<br> a bit of heart in it.<br> Greenwich Village was there,<br> and New York was around it.<br> And the rest of New York did not act<br> the way Greenwich Village did, exactly.<br> It was sort of a center of dissent<br> and had been for a long time<br> in American life.<br> People from all over<br> the country came there.<br> They were regarded as bohemian.<br> Their ways of life were irregular.<br> The way they dressed<br> and certainly the way they thought<br> was outside the mainstream<br> of American life.<br> And as I recollect it,<br> marriage was not important<br> in Greenwich Village.<br> I remember hearing a line<br> Jack said to somebody<br> he was trying to lure into bed.<br> She was being very coy, and he said,<br> "Aren't you pagan enough?"<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Jack?<br> If it's illegal to hand out pamphlets<br> on birth control,<br> I'm proud to be a criminal.<br> No one is arguing with your<br> inalienable right to go to jail, Emma.<br> All I'm saying<br> is that this is not the right time<br> to go to jail for birth control.<br> Oh, there's a right time<br> to go to jail for birth control?<br> The Masses is governing<br> conscience now?<br> Soon you'll be indistinguishable<br> from The New York Times.<br> Emma, all I'm saying<br> is that you are too valuable<br> - to the anti-war movement.<br> - You're wrong.<br> - No, he's right. If we get into this war...<br> - And you're wrong.<br> - Will you let me finish my sentence?<br> - Your sentence is not worth finishing.<br> Thousands of American women,<br> overworked, underfed,<br> are dying, giving birth to anemic<br> children who can't last out a year.<br> Are their lives any less valuable<br> than thousands of American boys'?<br> - I want those back Tuesday.<br> - I'm not saying... Do you think?<br> - Oh, shit.<br> - Exactly.<br> Good night.<br> - You want some coffee?<br> - Chase and Sanborn?<br> - I'm out of coffee.<br> - Again? I'm leaving.<br> No, the conversation is over.<br> You're a journalist, Jack.<br> When you're a revolutionary,<br> we'll discuss priorities.<br> Hopefully over coffee.<br> - It's late, I'll walk you home.<br> - Why? I won't hurt anybody.<br> Well...<br> Yeah.<br> It's Friday night.<br> I'm so glad to see you.<br> Really, I'm so glad to see you.<br> I finished your articles.<br> They're very good.<br> The railroad piece, I think, is...<br> Needs polishing.<br> - It's repetitious, but...<br> - But that's deliberate.<br> I'm using repetition to make a point.<br> I don't want it to seem too polished.<br> Oh.<br> Well, I think<br> you're gonna love New York.<br> Emma, Emma, Emma.<br> I think it was Emma Goldberg.<br> I think so.<br> I never forgot Emma Goldman.<br> She inspired me to the very depths.<br> And Max Eastman was a beloved man.<br> The real radical, a free spirit.<br> He was in that same group<br> with that Emma Goldman.<br> That was her name.<br> Goldman, not Goldberg.<br> Floyd Dell was one of them.<br> He wrote novels, beautiful novels.<br> The radicals included people<br> like the IWWs<br> and Bill Haywood.<br> And there were Walter Lippmann,<br> and Lincoln Steffens<br> and Isadora Duncan<br> and Edna St. Vincent Millay.<br> Alfred Stieglitz...<br> Oh, and Margaret Sanger.<br> My Lord, I picketed for her.<br> And, of course,<br> the great writer Eugene O'Neill<br> came from down there.<br> I don't think there's anybody<br> who can touch O'Neill today.<br> You have to be a bit of a rebel<br> to be an artist of any kind, I believe.<br> And everybody in Greenwich Village<br> was a bit of a rebel.<br> - What do you do, Louise?<br> - I write.<br> Good for you.<br> Could you pass the bread, please?<br> - Thanks.<br> - Because to the middle-class American,<br> everyone on the left is the same.<br> An anarchist, a socialist...<br> Would you pass the bread, please?<br> - What do you do, Louise?<br> - I write.<br> Good. Madame Schumann-Heink...<br> Jack tells me you write, Miss Bryant.<br> What do you write about?<br> Everything.<br> You write about everything?<br> Everything. Yes. Everything, nothing...<br> Just...<br> I see.<br> Now, about Davis and Sloan,<br> have they quit?<br> Not yet, but they...<br> I don't think they should sit here<br> like this. I don't. I think it's cruel.<br> - It's just...<br> - Organization, right?<br> Look, what does a capitalist do?<br> Let me ask you that, Mike.<br> Huh? Tell me.<br> I mean, what does he make,<br> besides money?<br> I don't know what he makes.<br> The workers do all the work, don't they?<br> Well, what if they got organized?<br> I mean, all the workers.<br> Not just the plumbers,<br> and the carpenters<br> and the goddamn cigar makers.<br> But all of them, all over the world?<br> Not in just one country.<br> Give him a beer, will you?<br> What if they all got organized?<br> Don't you think they could...<br> They could change society overnight.<br> They can make it into<br> anything they wanted.<br> Jack, can I tap you for $5? I'm flat.<br> Well, don't ask this pretentious<br> son of a bitch for money.<br> If you need $5, I'll give it to you.<br> Let me have $4.50, will you?<br> - What isn't fair?<br> - You see what I'm saying?<br> If all the workers in the world<br> belonged to one big union,<br> - there wouldn't be a war, would there?<br> - Are you listening to me?<br> Miss Bryant.<br> You've been nursing<br> that beer for an hour.<br> Can I get you a glass of wine<br> or something?<br> No, thank you. I'm fine.<br> Thank you, anyway.<br> - Beer's fine.<br> - You are an amiable person.<br> And a very good painter, I hear.<br> I write.<br> Read Jung!<br> "Read Freud, read Jung."<br> Read Engels, read Marx!<br> My God, you can't interpret Freud<br> in an economic context.<br> You know you got a taxi waiting?<br> Zosima represents<br> the corruption of religion.<br> I tell you you're wrong.<br> - And Jung is a mystic...<br> - But do you seriously believe...<br> - How long are they going to stay?<br> - I don't know. They'll get out in a while.<br> - I'll only be gone for a day.<br> - You just got back from Boston.<br> Hey, why don't you come<br> with me to Baltimore?<br> Really? What am I supposed<br> to come to Baltimore as?<br> What as?<br> Jack, you know, you got a taxi waiting.<br> Taxi's waiting, Jack.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> We've been trying for two years.<br> Capitalists can take this country into<br> war any time they damn well please.<br> The only impact you can make<br> is in the streets.<br> Of course, but...<br> But don't you think, Emma,<br> that if Debs gets a lot of votes,<br> it'll strengthen that image?<br> No, I don't. I think voting is the opium<br> of the masses in this country.<br> Every four years, you deaden the pain.<br> Yeah, but...<br> Don't you think...<br> I just made it very clear<br> what I think, Miss Bryant.<br> Come on, E.G.<br> Don't be so goddamn dogmatic.<br> - Louise has a point. She says...<br> - Suddenly I'm dogmatic.<br> Why does my status change<br> every time you get a new woman, Jack?<br> Bernie, could I have the red wine?<br> Louise, would you like a glass?<br> She's just... She's upset with me.<br> It's got nothing to do with you.<br> Nothing to do with you.<br> Thank you. It's a great comfort.<br> The house is completely filled<br> with people when you're gone.<br> They use it as if it was<br> a meeting hall or something.<br> - I can't get any work done.<br> - Just throw them out.<br> - How am I supposed to throw them out?<br> - Just kick them out.<br> Tell them to leave.<br> I'm not going to<br> say to Max Eastman, "Leave."<br> - Just throw them out.<br> - Jack?<br> Jack, is that you?<br> Jack, it's very good to see you.<br> - Hello, Horace. How are you?<br> - Very good to see you.<br> - You know Louise Bryant?<br> - Yes, hello. How are you?<br> - Very nice to see you.<br> - How do you do?<br> Great pleasure.<br> - Hi, Max. How are you?<br> - Divine, Horace.<br> - And Floyd, good to see you.<br> - Hello, Horace.<br> Still getting arrested, Jack?<br> I try.<br> How about you, Miss Bryant?<br> Are you trying to get arrested, too?<br> No, not really.<br> - What do you do, Miss Bryant?<br> - I write.<br> You write? Now, may I ask,<br> what are you working on?<br> It's impossible to describe.<br> It's impossible to describe?<br> She just did a hell of a piece<br> on the influence of the Armory Show<br> and you ought to read it.<br> Well, you know,<br> I very much would like to read that.<br> Why don't you give me a call<br> at The Metropolitan?<br> In fact, even better,<br> why don't we have a drink on Thursday?<br> - Fine.<br> - We can talk about the Armory Show.<br> - It's a date, then.<br> - Well, all right.<br> That's wonderful. Fine.<br> Jack!<br> Now, you stay out<br> of the slammer, now, okay?<br> Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> - Jack, please don't do that.<br> - What?<br> He's the editor of Metropolitan.<br> I've known him for years.<br> - Jack, I can speak for myself.<br> - So can your work.<br> - I don't want you to do that...<br> - Taxi's waiting, Jack.<br> Oh. Taxi's waiting, Jack.<br> Jack...<br> I'll see you at the end<br> of the week, okay?<br> - Okay?<br> - Wait. Wait.<br> Maybe I will call him about Thursday.<br> Yeah, call him about Thursday.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> - See you, boys.<br> - Bye-bye, Jack.<br> - Bye-bye, Jack.<br> - See you.<br> See you, Jack.<br> "The railroad's opening new frontiers,<br> "and crisscrossing it all<br> are the railroads.<br> "The railroad's opening new frontiers,<br> "and in turn, these frontiers...<br> "And in turn, these frontiers..."<br> Oh, God.<br> It is repetitious.<br> We're not human beings,<br> we're a commodity.<br> - And how many days a week?<br> - Seven days.<br> - Every day?<br> - They said,<br> "If you don't come to work on Sunday,<br> don't come on Monday."<br> - What do you make an hour?<br> - 20 cents.<br> How many times have they<br> slammed the door on your face<br> because the labor you do<br> is called unskilled?<br> That's right, Bill.<br> Well, the IWW's not gonna<br> turn you down<br> - because you're unskilled.<br> - Listen to him, George.<br> Or skilled. Or black or white or yellow.<br> Seven days a week.<br> - What do you make an hour?<br> - 10 cents an hour.<br> One big union.<br> - All workers belong...<br> - Listen, read that. That's important.<br> I'm looking for a lathe worker<br> named Pasquale Alberti.<br> He had an industrial accident. He got<br> his leg crushed. Do you know him?<br> Yeah, sure, Harvard.<br> Is that what they wanna read about<br> in Greenwich Village now,<br> industrial accidents?<br> And for that, we need power.<br> And there's only one way to get power.<br> Organize!<br> All the workers together!<br> One big union!<br> And the war the IWW<br> wants you to get into is class war!<br> Not a war in Europe!<br> War against the capitalists!<br> You'll never get anything or anywhere,<br> until the whole working class<br> belongs to one big...<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> you've got 20 seconds<br> to vacate the premises.<br> May I ask on what authority?<br> On my authority.<br> This is an illegal assembly.<br> Excuse me, Officer. These men<br> have the legal right to assemble.<br> That's all they're doing.<br> We know what the hell they doing.<br> - What the hell you doing?<br> - Me?<br> You.<br> - I write.<br> - You write?<br> You wrong.<br> Get him out of here!<br> Here they are.<br> The folio. The oeuvre.<br> Well...<br> How is Jack?<br> I do hope he's being more careful<br> about what he's writing these days.<br> I'd hate to see him not able<br> to get into print.<br> Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.<br> Did you tell him<br> where we were having drinks?<br> No, I will. He's out of town.<br> Mr. Whigham, excuse me, but<br> the Armory Show piece is on the top.<br> Oh, this is the Armory...<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes. Of course. Here it is.<br> Well...<br> I really ought to spend<br> more time on this.<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> What about dinner?<br> - Dinner?<br> - Jack wouldn't mind.<br> - Why would he mind?<br> - Well, we're all grownups, of course,<br> but Jack's rather...<br> He's rather an odd duck, isn't he?<br> And I've never really known how...<br> Mr. Whigham, are you saying you need<br> Jack's permission<br> to make a pass at me?<br> Don't get so upset about it.<br> For Christ's sake,<br> I made two little tiny changes...<br> Don't rewrite what I write, Pete.<br> What the hell's the matter<br> with you, Jack?<br> The IWW's a bunch of Reds.<br> Come on.<br> We got Reds in the IWW,<br> got Reds in the Village.<br> We've got nothing<br> but Reds around here.<br> For Christ's sake,<br> you're the best goddamn writer around.<br> Now, what the hell<br> you wanna waste your time<br> with a lot of Red propaganda<br> nobody's ever gonna print?<br> It's the truth.<br> Does that mean anything around here?<br> Well, who the hell's to say<br> what the truth is?<br> A bunch of goddamn Reds in the IWW?<br> You're not being fair to the AF of L.<br> - Now, give me the goddamn article...<br> - You're gonna rewrite what I write.<br> I'm just gonna take it<br> to a magazine that won't.<br> Well, fine. Take it to The Masses.<br> - They're a bunch of Reds.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Who's gonna pay your rent?<br> - Rent's easy, Pete.<br> You just don't rewrite what I write.<br> You got that? Don't rewrite what I write.<br> You stubborn son of a bitch.<br> Who's gonna pay your rent?<br> Louise?<br> I got every one in the shop.<br> We're broke, but we've got them all.<br> Thanks.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's nothing. How'd it go?<br> A lot better than we thought it would.<br> - You see Whigham?<br> - Yesterday.<br> - How was that?<br> - We mostly talked about you, of course.<br> Did he offer you work?<br> No, but he made a big point<br> of telling me<br> what wonderful friends<br> you and he have become over the years.<br> It was a fascinating meeting.<br> Are you angry at Whigham or me?<br> What is it?<br> It's nothing.<br> You said you'd be back Tuesday<br> and it's Saturday.<br> Didn't I say I'd back<br> at the end of the week?<br> - The end of the week is Friday.<br> - The end of the week is Friday?<br> Saturday's not the<br> end of the week anymore, huh?<br> Jack, you said you'd be back Tuesday!<br> What difference does it make?<br> What do you think I've been doing?<br> Running around listening<br> to the sound of my own voice?<br> How do I know whose voice<br> you've been listening to?<br> Obviously you like it<br> a lot better than mine!<br> Look at me. Oh, God!<br> I'm like a wife.<br> I'm like a boring, clinging,<br> miserable little wife.<br> - Who'd wanna come home to me?<br> - Me!<br> Well, I can't do this!<br> I can't do this anymore!<br> You can't do what?<br> I'm just living in your margins.<br> I don't know what I'm doing here.<br> I don't know what my purpose is.<br> - Well, tell me what you want.<br> - I want to stop needing you!<br> I want you to know something.<br> I asked Whigham<br> if he'd send me to France.<br> - Is that what you want?<br> - That's what I want.<br> - What are you doing, Louise?<br> - I can't work around you.<br> Will you tell me why you're doing this?<br> I'm not taken seriously<br> when you're around.<br> When I'm around<br> you're not taken seriously?<br> Oh, God, this is not good.<br> You mean<br> you think I'm taken more seriously?<br> Is that what you're talking about?<br> Do you mean you're not?<br> Come on, Jack.<br> You know what I'm saying.<br> You're not being honest with me.<br> I don't know what you're saying.<br> You're not being honest with me.<br> Please, be honest with me.<br> I am so being honest with you.<br> Maybe if you took yourself a little more<br> seriously, other people would, too.<br> I told you what I thought<br> about the Armory piece.<br> I was honest about that.<br> I think it's very nice,<br> but no, I don't take it very seriously.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Why do you even expect<br> to be taken seriously if you're<br> not writing about serious things?<br> I don't understand that.<br> I found myself an apartment.<br> I'm looking for one.<br> I'm not even sure I know<br> what things you're serious about.<br> One day you're writing<br> about the railroads,<br> and you don't even finish the piece.<br> The next day you're doing a piece<br> on an art exhibition<br> that happened three years ago.<br> Look, why do you give me<br> anything to read, anyway?<br> If I criticize it at all,<br> you tell me you like it the way it is.<br> And when we're out with other people,<br> if somebody doesn't ask you<br> a direct question,<br> you tell me you feel ignored.<br> But with everything<br> that's happening in the world today,<br> you decide to sit down and write a piece<br> on the influence of the goddamned<br> Armory Show of 1913!<br> Are people supposed<br> to take that seriously?<br> Well, I don't really care!<br> - You care!<br> - I'm not really... I don't care!<br> - You care!<br> - I don't care!<br> And I'm not interested<br> in whether your stupid friends<br> - take me seriously or not!<br> - Well, they don't take it seriously.<br> That's why they don't take it seriously.<br> I found an apartment on Houston Street,<br> and I'm moving in.<br> And I'll tell you something else,<br> Jack Reed.<br> I don't think we like the same people<br> or the same kind of life.<br> - And I wanna be on my own.<br> - Go ahead, be on your own!<br> I don't give a damn!<br> You're on your own anyway.<br> Oh! I know you don't give a damn!<br> Well, will you tell me<br> why the hell I should give a damn?<br> You shouldn't! Don't give a damn!<br> - I don't give a damn, either!<br> - That's right! I don't give a damn!<br> - I'm getting out of here!<br> - Good, fine! I'm leaving, too!<br> Honey, can we just<br> get out of New York?<br> Let's go somewhere<br> and just write what we wanna write.<br> Provincetown was<br> just a tiny little fishing village.<br> And it was very, very conservative.<br> We'd take the Fall River steamer<br> up there, I remember, every summer.<br> We used to save fares<br> by sleeping in tiers.<br> And we always got bedbugs.<br> You did whatever you pleased up there.<br> And we put on some very<br> interesting plays, experimental plays<br> that a commercial theater<br> couldn't possibly do.<br> Take Susan Glaspell's Trifles.<br> There's a whole play<br> without the protagonist<br> even appearing on the stage.<br> And they gave three one-act plays.<br> One of them was a play by...<br> I always thought it was by John Reed<br> and Louise Bryant.<br> But I see it's by her.<br> They were in it.<br> The play was terrible,<br> and they were worse.<br> And of course, Gene O'Neill<br> was known as the poet,<br> but I liked his plays<br> better than his poetry.<br> Will you never understand?<br> Are you so stupid<br> that you do not know what I mean?<br> I am offering myself to you.<br> I am kneeling before you.<br> I have promised you my body,<br> my body that men have<br> found so beautiful.<br> I have promised to love you,<br> a negro sailor!<br> Tell them not to stand behind the moon.<br> Don't stand behind the moon.<br> - Back?<br> - Can you step back a little bit?<br> 'Cause of the moon.<br> This is the moon here.<br> - This way?<br> - Yes.<br> Take it from "I hate the sea."<br> Will you never understand?<br> Are you so stupid<br> that you don't know what I mean?<br> I'm offering myself to you.<br> I'm kneeling before you.<br> I... I, who have had so many men<br> kneel before me,<br> I'm offering you my body,<br> my body that men have<br> found so beautiful.<br> I have promised to love you.<br> You, a negro sailor.<br> Is that not humiliation enough<br> that you must keep me waiting so?<br> Answer me, please! Answer me.<br> Will you give me that water?<br> I have no water.<br> Old Teddy wants this war, doesn't he?<br> I wonder how long it'll take the public<br> to find out he's a maniac.<br> Teddy Roosevelt has rabies.<br> Universal military training.<br> Jack, your second speech is out.<br> And the ironic part of it is<br> that poor people, they love him.<br> Sure, they do.<br> They'll take him up San Juan Hill again.<br> You can't touch the bunny suit.<br> It's rented.<br> Did you read the piece<br> on the convention?<br> If the left doesn't defend Wilson,<br> we're gonna get President Hughes.<br> Think we ought to go to St. Louis?<br> I am not going to St. Louis<br> to defend Wilson.<br> - I think we should.<br> - Why? What good would it do?<br> I don't know,<br> if you don't think Hughes would have us<br> in a war in a few months,<br> it wouldn't do any good at all.<br> Wilson's kept us out so far.<br> Reed thought that he was a good poet.<br> He was a terrible poet.<br> He thought that he could write<br> good novels.<br> Short stories.<br> Of course, he was a poet.<br> And not a great poet,<br> but some of it was very fine.<br> But, as a journalist,<br> Jack Reed topped them all.<br> - Look. Pull this up.<br> - Hey, Jack.<br> See? That's good.<br> Jack, your ride's here.<br> - Excuse me. I'll wait outside.<br> - Okay. Okay.<br> - Do you see what I mean? If one...<br> - Jack, the taxi's waiting.<br> Yeah, I got to run.<br> Bye, honey.<br> Jack Reed wanted to stir up trouble,<br> he wanted to stir up trouble<br> for the capitalists.<br> And he also wanted<br> to arouse the working masses<br> to the necessity of some<br> kind of effective united action.<br> In other words, I am accusing him<br> of either being a busybody<br> or of being a fraidy-cat,<br> not wanting to face things<br> of his own nature.<br> Dear Louise, St. Louis is very hot<br> and very crowded with Democrats,<br> all having a wonderful time<br> and wearing little paper hats<br> in anticipation of Wilson's nomination.<br> I'd like to think it's because<br> he doesn't want the United States<br> to go into the war,<br> but who knows<br> the mind of a Democrat?<br> By the way, I've decided to throw out<br> the poem on white lilies.<br> The rhyming scheme was wrong.<br> Maybe when I get back<br> I can start it again.<br> Politics sure plays hell<br> with your poetry.<br> I keep thinking I see you.<br> It's the damnedest thing.<br> I miss you, honey.<br> I miss walking on the beach.<br> - Hello.<br> - Where's the whiskey?<br> Would you like a glass?<br> Don't try and decide.<br> I'll get you one.<br> I like your play.<br> I only hope I can do the part justice.<br> I think your dialogue is beautiful.<br> I really do, I love it...<br> Then why the hell<br> don't you just stand still and say it<br> instead of wandering all over the stage?<br> You're supposed to be looking<br> for your soul, not an ashtray.<br> Would you rather I didn't smoke<br> during rehearsals?<br> I'd rather you went up in flames<br> than put out your cigarette<br> in the middle<br> of a monologue about birth.<br> I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.<br> It makes me wanna cancel<br> the whole production.<br> I won't do it again.<br> Excuse me, I'm sorry.<br> You keep the glass. I'll take the bottle.<br> Are you leaving?<br> Give me your glass.<br> Are you nervous?<br> - Or is that a tremor?<br> - Why aren't you in Chicago with Jack?<br> Why should I be?<br> He has his things, I have mine.<br> - What are they?<br> - What?<br> The things that you have that are yours.<br> What are they?<br> My work, for one.<br> He's a real mean<br> son of a bitch, isn't he?<br> What do you mean?<br> Leaving you alone with your work.<br> - You think I mind?<br> - You should.<br> It's the one thing<br> we mustn't be left alone with.<br> - You may feel that way, I don't.<br> - Good.<br> Don't let those village radicals keep you<br> from being what you should be.<br> What do you think I should be?<br> The center of attention.<br> Well, you must have been<br> with some very competitive women.<br> Let's just say possessive.<br> Possessive? That's something else.<br> It's a waste of time.<br> I'm not.<br> Neither is Jack, for that matter.<br> Oh, yes. I know.<br> You and Jack have your own things.<br> He has the freedom to do the things<br> that he wants to and so do I.<br> And I think anyone who's afraid<br> of that kind of freedom<br> is really only afraid<br> of his own emptiness.<br> Are you making this up<br> as you go along?<br> I'd like you to go.<br> Why?<br> Because I don't want to be patronized.<br> I'm sorry if you don't believe<br> in mutual independence<br> and free love and respect.<br> Don't give me a lot of parlor socialism<br> that you learned in the Village.<br> If you were mine, I wouldn't share you<br> with anybody or anything.<br> It'd be just you and me.<br> You'd be at the center of it all.<br> You know,<br> it would feel lot more like love<br> than being left alone with your work.<br> - I hope I haven't upset you.<br> - Not at all. I'm grateful.<br> But you seem to be looking<br> for something much more serious<br> than what I had in mind.<br> - Than what you had in mind?<br> - Yes.<br> You see, Jack and I<br> are both perfectly capable<br> of living with our beliefs.<br> But I think someone as romantic as you<br> would be destroyed by them.<br> And I don't want that to happen.<br> It would upset Jack too much.<br> You can't come and play in my yard<br> I don't love you anymore<br> You'll be sorry when you see me<br> Sliding down my cellar door<br> You can't holler down my rain barrel<br> You can't climb my apple tree<br> I don't want to play in your yard<br> If you can't be good to me<br> I don't want to play in your yard<br> I don't like you anymore<br> You'll be sorry when you see me<br> Sliding down our cellar door<br> You can't holler down our rain barrel<br> You can't climb our apple tree<br> I don't want to play in your yard<br> If you won't be good to me<br> Wonderful!<br> Floyd, I've been<br> waiting for this for weeks.<br> Tap your sensuality.<br> - Wonderful close.<br> - Extraordinary.<br> Very good. Excellent.<br> - Floyd, that's new for you, isn't it?<br> - Max, what about you?<br> - Okay. Who's next?<br> - I just recited<br> two-thirds of my new play.<br> You said it was a work<br> of uncanny perception.<br> Oh, did I? How quickly we forget.<br> - Well!<br> - Jack. Come in.<br> News from the front.<br> - Hello, Jack.<br> - Hello, Jack.<br> - Hi, Jack.<br> - How was the trip?<br> Welcome back.<br> - Who's next?<br> - Nobody's next.<br> Let's have a dance out of Gene.<br> Jack, you're just in time<br> to see O'Neill dance.<br> Okay. Do something Irish.<br> Come on, Gene.<br> Yeah. Let's have it, Gene.<br> - Yeah. Go ahead Gene.<br> - Recite something from your new play.<br> Hutch says it's wonderful.<br> Tell us about the convention, Jack.<br> How was Wilson's speech?<br> Never mind the speech.<br> What was he wearing?<br> - What about Wilson?<br> - Yeah. What about Wilson?<br> Oh, I don't think there's any reason to<br> believe that Wilson's gonna do anything<br> other than support the interest of the<br> ruling class and take us into the war.<br> But as long as he says he's against it,<br> then I think we have to support him.<br> Because he'll have to make good on<br> that campaign promise<br> for at least a few months<br> and that might give us time<br> to strengthen the anti-war coalition.<br> But there's a lot more pro-war feeling in<br> the streets now than there was before...<br> You want another drink, Gene?<br> I guess not.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> Good night.<br> Would you like<br> some cold tea with lemon?<br> No, thanks.<br> Well, I'll have some, anyway.<br> - What's this?<br> - A poem.<br> May I read it?<br> I didn't finish it.<br> Finish it.<br> Finish it?<br> Would that make you happy?<br> If I were a poet?<br> I'm happy.<br> - Jack.<br> - Why don't you get some sleep?<br> Jack.<br> There's something<br> that I have to tell you.<br> - You don't have to tell me anything.<br> - No?<br> No.<br> You want to get married?<br> Okay. There we go. I'll see...<br> - Oh, careful there. Careful.<br> - There's two more to come.<br> Two? No, there should be three.<br> Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.<br> I'm very sorry to hover like this.<br> It's not that<br> you're not doing a wonderful job.<br> It's just that I'm very concerned<br> about this one particular box.<br> - Here. No. No.<br> - I'll take it.<br> Where's the whiskey?<br> - Lady, where do you want this?<br> - Oh, just put it over there.<br> That'll be fine. Thank you.<br> Yeah.<br> - Anything to drink in there?<br> - Drink?<br> Oh, here. Thanks.<br> Thank you very much. I...<br> - Thank you. Good.<br> - Thank you.<br> Oh. Well. Let's see now. Here we are.<br> - Gene?<br> - No glass?<br> Oh. Let's see.<br> Well, I guess I should have<br> labeled these, shouldn't I have?<br> No. No, that isn't the right one.<br> Try this one.<br> Well, what are you working on, Gene?<br> At the moment, Scotch.<br> I found a cup. Will a cup be all right?<br> - I'd prefer a glass.<br> - A glass.<br> You know,<br> you left without saying goodbye.<br> That's not like you, not that I have<br> slightest idea what you're like.<br> Success at last. See, a... Here we go.<br> Your skill as a bartender<br> seems to have deteriorated.<br> - Are you nervous?<br> - Yes. No. I'm...<br> Why should I be nervous? My God,<br> it's gonna smell like a saloon in here.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's a poem telling you that I love you.<br> And that I won't be possessive<br> and I won't be jealous.<br> And you can sleep with whoever<br> you want, live with whoever you want.<br> I'll do anything that you say.<br> I'd like to kill you, but I can't.<br> So you can do whatever you want to,<br> except not see me.<br> Or smoke during the monologue.<br> Gene, Jack and I,<br> we haven't told anyone yet<br> because we were too embarrassed.<br> But<br> we're married.<br> Jack and I got married.<br> - That is embarrassing.<br> - Yes. Isn't it?<br> We felt very silly, but we wanted to do it.<br> And it's gonna be good.<br> We're gonna work together.<br> We're gonna spend<br> all our time together.<br> That's why we took a lease<br> on this place,<br> so we wouldn't have to go back<br> to the city.<br> Does this mean that we have to cheat?<br> Or is this a free<br> and independent marriage?<br> - Gene.<br> - You're a lying Irish whore from Portland<br> and you used me<br> to get Jack Reed to marry you.<br> No, I didn't.<br> I just want us to be friends, Gene.<br> Oh, how genteel. That would be a<br> good role for you, wouldn't it?<br> "There's Louise with Jack and Gene.<br> "He's crazy about her,<br> but Jack doesn't know.<br> "Poor Jack. Poor Gene.<br> What a heartbreaker she is."<br> What a heartbreaker you are, Louise.<br> I'm sorry. I'm...<br> Where is he?<br> Washington.<br> Well, Mrs. Reed,<br> I'll do whatever you say.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Wish us well?<br> I wish you well.<br> You and Jack.<br> Jack!<br> Oh, God.<br> I'm not sure whether she had an affair<br> with Eugene O'Neill or not<br> during this time.<br> And nobody seemed to know. Or...<br> It was nobody's business, anyway, so...<br> I don't know what that situation was.<br> The report was that<br> she and Reed and O'Neill<br> had a mnage trois.<br> Jack, what... What is...<br> Oh, God! I swear...<br> ...that we love America!<br> We love her mountains, her forests...<br> There were mutinies<br> in the French army,<br> there were mutinies<br> in various parts of the front.<br> And then, in 1917, the troops,<br> poorly armed,<br> poorly equipped, poorly clothed,<br> went back to Russia<br> to talk it out with the czar.<br> And when they got through,<br> there wasn't any czar.<br> Revolution in Russia.<br> This was the spring of 1917.<br> And I became so excited<br> that I zigzag-jumped the benches<br> as we walked out of the park.<br> Oh, I was so happy as a young boy.<br> Revolution, the people take over,<br> down with the czar!<br> Naturally, I was happy.<br> Well, haven't you made the politics<br> a little nebulous here?<br> - What do you mean "nebulous"?<br> - Unclear...<br> - How can you say they're unclear?<br> - Well, they're unclear to me. I...<br> Why am I necessarily attempting<br> to define the politics<br> of a specific group of people?<br> It isn't what I said.<br> I think it's a vast oversimplification.<br> Oh, it's just an opinion.<br> You know,<br> if you made carbons of these,<br> I could take them on the train with me.<br> Wilson, of course,<br> was elected on the platform of<br> "Keep us out of war" in 1916.<br> But in 1917, Wilson reversed himself<br> and declared war against Germany.<br> The mission at that time was to make<br> the world safe for democracy.<br> Reed said,<br> "This is a war for democracy?<br> Where is the goddamn democracy?"<br> If men really disapproved of war, dear,<br> we'd have stopped wars years ago.<br> Men like wars. Always have.<br> So they all went and got little uniforms,<br> went to war.<br> - My country is at war!<br> - Yes.<br> And so today, I, too, am at war!<br> My name is Jack Reed,<br> I'm from New York.<br> This is not my war, and I'm not gonna<br> have anything to do with it!<br> All right. All right.<br> All right, folks.<br> There was a lot of anti-war feeling,<br> of course.<br> We had no one against the war.<br> There wasn't a soul against the war.<br> Well, I'm not talking about saying it<br> to the workers any other way.<br> How do we move them?<br> Right. How do we organize them?<br> The Socialist Party...<br> The Socialist Party of America<br> is nothing to sneeze at.<br> You think the Socialist Party<br> is going to take a position?<br> You boys are Reds, aren't you?<br> The Socialist Party is useless.<br> Jack, is that right?<br> Now, that's the truth. Jack?<br> The United States is at war.<br> Your friends are talking to you.<br> If the workers of the world act together,<br> they can stop the war. And I'm not...<br> This one even pisses red.<br> You ran around saving the world<br> until your kidney acted up again.<br> Very intelligent.<br> And you're gonna keep running around<br> making speeches<br> until you wind up<br> in the hospital. Brilliant.<br> And then,<br> you're gonna lose your kidney. Perfect.<br> Harry, how much is the government<br> paying you to keep me quiet?<br> - Very funny. Keep laughing.<br> - Yeah.<br> That hurt, didn't it?<br> Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.<br> You're not gonna be able to keep doing<br> what you've been doing.<br> This is a serious condition.<br> It could kill you.<br> Harry, look, I want to know if...<br> Could this thing interfere<br> with having children?<br> - Yes. You cannot have sex if you die.<br> - No, come on, Harry. Seriously.<br> Are you thinking about having children?<br> Not at the moment,<br> but I want to be able to...<br> Is Louise talking about it?<br> No.<br> Well, just because<br> she isn't talking about it<br> it doesn't mean<br> she isn't thinking about it.<br> Don't worry. You don't make babies<br> with your kidneys.<br> Look, I'm gonna send you home<br> to Louise.<br> Tell her to keep you there,<br> put you in bed,<br> give you lots of liquids.<br> I'm gonna write it all down.<br> Look, Louise doesn't know about<br> this. And I don't want her to, okay?<br> - Fine.<br> - So, can you give me my bill here?<br> - I don't want it sent to the house.<br> - Do you have any money?<br> Not at the moment.<br> Then why the hell<br> should I give you a bill? Go home.<br> It is my belief that socialism and peace<br> are inseparable.<br> And I reiterate that the Socialist Party<br> will stand firmly behind<br> its resolution to oppose<br> American involvement in this war!<br> Mr. Chairman, Louis Fraina,<br> Local Boston.<br> The chair recognizes<br> the delegate from Boston.<br> And I still want to know<br> what specific action<br> we are going to take against the war.<br> Your resolution is all very nice,<br> but will it stop even one boy from<br> being killed? I don't think so.<br> ...stigmatized as unpatriotic.<br> The task that confronts us is difficult.<br> Let us hope<br> that we can handle it properly.<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> Stupid!<br> I'd like to know if the Socialist Party<br> is gonna fight conscription or not.<br> - That's what I'd like to know.<br> - Will the delegate identify himself?<br> I am not a delegate, Mr. Chairman.<br> My name is John Reed,<br> I write for the magazine The Masses,<br> and I want to know if the Socialist Party<br> is gonna organize demonstrations...<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.<br> You have no credentials here.<br> Now, this floor is reserved<br> for delegates, not journalists.<br> Mr. Chairman,<br> is the Socialist Party prepared<br> - to take a position on the draft or not?<br> - Hey, shut up!<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.<br> You have no credentials.<br> Let him speak, will you?<br> Mr. Reed,<br> you're getting into party politics, eh?<br> I'm just trying to be a journalist.<br> Mr. Chairman...<br> So is Trotsky.<br> Let us see what happens in Russia.<br> Why don't you join the Socialist Party?<br> We need good people like you.<br> Big things are happening in Russia.<br> As appalling as it may seem<br> to see socialists supporting bloodshed,<br> I can understand the necessity<br> of supporting one's government<br> during times of war.<br> The task that confronts us is a giant!<br> In that,<br> we must continue our opposition!<br> - We have to give this dog a name.<br> - Well, she has a name.<br> What's the matter with her name?<br> - I can't find anything in this house.<br> - I'm not going to call a dog "Dog."<br> I suppose if she were a baby,<br> you'd wanna call her "Person."<br> Not really.<br> I think I might wanna call her "Jack."<br> No. No. Bad.<br> See, now this is why<br> I can't find anything.<br> You put things anywhere.<br> Dog! Dog!<br> She's still not housebroken.<br> You got to grab her<br> when she squats like that,<br> and then take her outside. That's right.<br> And then when she goes,<br> you've got to give her a reward.<br> All right. Now, stay, Dog.<br> Are we having garlic for dinner, honey?<br> No, no, no.<br> Why? Why, do you think<br> I'm using too much garlic?<br> I thought I'd put a little in the sauce.<br> Garlic doesn't bother me.<br> - That's from Gene.<br> - Sorry. I didn't mean to read it.<br> I didn't realize what it was.<br> He gave it to me in October.<br> I haven't seen him since.<br> - You don't have to explain.<br> - I'm not explaining.<br> - I'm just telling you it's over.<br> - Louise, look.<br> I don't expect you to tell me<br> everything you do.<br> What about if you tell me something,<br> just tell me the truth?<br> - Jack, I haven't seen him.<br> - Don't do that, Louise.<br> Don't tell me that Gene gave you<br> a love poem six or seven months ago,<br> but you put it in a book<br> and you haven't seen him since.<br> I don't care<br> whether you've seen him or not.<br> - I just care about dishonesty.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> You don't care<br> that I had an affair with another man,<br> you just care about dishonesty?<br> Look who's being dishonest.<br> You care. You care so much,<br> you won't even talk about it.<br> - You won't even mention...<br> - Wanna talk? I'll talk about it.<br> You want to be honest about it?<br> If I didn't wanna be honest about it,<br> do you think I'd be silly enough<br> to leave a poem he gave me<br> lying around in the house<br> in a book of Walt Whitman?<br> Why not Whitman?<br> I'm sure Gene would feel right at home<br> in that company.<br> Oh, no. You don't care.<br> Why the hell should I care that<br> you slept with somebody else?<br> Do you think I haven't?<br> I don't think we have to report<br> to each other<br> every time we go to bed with somebody.<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> It doesn't mean that I love you any less.<br> Do you love me any less<br> 'cause you went to bed with Gene?<br> What difference does it make?<br> I just don't think we should lie about it.<br> That's all.<br> - Who?<br> - What do you mean, "Who?"<br> - Who was it?<br> - Who was what?<br> Who was it?<br> What do you want, a list?<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> Louise.<br> Louise.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> - I wanna know where you're going.<br> - I don't want to talk about it.<br> - Well, I wanna talk about it.<br> - You said it all, Jack.<br> What? What did I say now<br> that we both haven't said 100 times?<br> Please forward my mail<br> to John K. Wheeler,<br> Wheeler Bell Syndicate.<br> I'll have someone pick up<br> the rest of my things in the morning.<br> Didn't we say that people had to give<br> each other freedom<br> - if they were gonna live together?<br> - We said a lot of things.<br> I thought<br> we weren't going to be possessive.<br> - I thought you loved me!<br> - Who says I don't?<br> You love yourself! Me, you fuck!<br> When you're not fucking other people,<br> that is!<br> Freedom? You mean I should just be<br> like you and not give a damn, is that...<br> Is that what fucking Gene means?<br> You don't give a damn about us?<br> I'm not packing my bag.<br> I wanna know where you're going.<br> - Get out of my...<br> - Where you going?<br> - Get out of my...<br> - You're not going...<br> Get away! Get out of my way.<br> - How many were there?<br> - Come on, Louise.<br> You don't know the first thing about<br> what living together means.<br> Go ahead. I know where you're going.<br> I thought you needed someone<br> to share your life with. But I was wrong.<br> As long as you get your two shots of<br> limelight every day.<br> You don't need a thing.<br> You go to hell! Both of you!<br> It could possibly have been<br> a matter of prestige, you know,<br> to say that you had an affair<br> with Louise Bryant.<br> I haven't been spared<br> the legends about men that are<br> supposed to have had affairs with me,<br> because I was known by name.<br> Affairs which never occurred at all.<br> It's very difficult to tell, you know.<br> Do you know there is nothing<br> more bewildering<br> than when you get a letter<br> from a loony who says,<br> "That marvelous week<br> we spent in Venice."<br> - Yeah.<br> - And it happens about every two years.<br> - Yes.<br> - It's most extraordinary.<br> One day, I was out walking<br> with my aunt in Portland.<br> And she was quite something.<br> She was six feet tall.<br> And I said to her,<br> "What is all this ado about Louise?<br> "What do you think of her, Aunt Belle?"<br> She said,<br> "Well, she had something<br> that just appeals."<br> That's my story.<br> - How you feeling?<br> - Oh, better.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Oh. Thanks, Harry.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, we got it out just in time.<br> But since God only knows what<br> condition the one you've got left is in,<br> you better treat it well.<br> That means, tell that goddamn Eastman<br> you got to be in bed by midnight.<br> If you get an infection now, that's it!<br> Absolutely no salt!<br> "Dear Jack,<br> I'm relieved you're feeling so well again.<br> "I talked to a specialist here in Paris.<br> "And he said you can lead<br> a perfectly normal life.<br> "I hope you're not neglecting<br> your writing.<br> "Please don't spend your energy<br> "getting caught up in things<br> you can't afford."<br> "Dear Jack, I'm enclosing a piece<br> I've written<br> "on a volunteer ambulance driver<br> "from the New York City<br> Police Department.<br> "Also, please don't keep asking me<br> if you can come over here.<br> "It just makes me think you have no..."<br> "Dear Jack, yes,<br> Wheeler's very happy with my work.<br> "Life here is so hectic and exhilarating<br> that I don't have a minute..."<br> "Dear Jack, don't worry, I'm well.<br> "My only problem is keeping up with<br> Wheeler's demands for more stories."<br> "...serial newsletter under the heading,<br> 'Letters from France.'<br> "Please don't mention this to anyone.<br> "I promised Wheeler I wouldn't<br> say anything to you."<br> "Dear Jack, I feel I've really grown<br> through my work for Wheeler,<br> "and there's no reason to worry about<br> my being here alone."<br> Bolsheviks, Sandy. The Bolsheviks!<br> Jesus Christ,<br> if the Bolsheviks get in, Sandy,<br> you can just bend right over<br> and kiss your ass goodbye.<br> Because they'll pull Russia<br> right out of the war.<br> Right off the Eastern Front.<br> They quit, that's all.<br> Pete, the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.<br> Russia isn't gonna get out of the war.<br> You want to walk down<br> the Champs-Elyses someday<br> and see 500,000 Krauts<br> come barreling out of Fouquet's?<br> You better hope that the Bolsheviks<br> are small potatoes.<br> Now, let's have another drink. Waiter!<br> Waiter, another round here.<br> Hey! Oh, God. It's Red Emma, Jr!<br> Hey, come over here!<br> Speak up, Pete, speak up.<br> They can't hear you in the next room.<br> - How are you, Jack?<br> - Good to see you.<br> God. You look 20 pounds lighter<br> since you lost that kidney.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - I bet you only piss about half as much.<br> Yeah, but twice as often. Sarsaparilla.<br> Jack, can the Bolsheviks<br> overthrow Kerensky?<br> Okay. Why don't you ask<br> an impartial observer?<br> Goddamn it, Jack. What the hell<br> you got against this war anyway?<br> Shit, why don't you bury the hatchet<br> with Wilson?<br> Get back into print so we can all read<br> some decent writing, you know.<br> - I'll drink to that.<br> - You'll drink to anything.<br> Well, that's right, too.<br> It's good to see you.<br> Jesus Christ. It's good to see you.<br> Goddamn, how's Louise?<br> Not so good.<br> - She's good.<br> - Tell her from me that I said<br> that John Wheeler wouldn't know<br> a story if it fell right on top of him.<br> I'll tell you.<br> Hey, Jack, what are you doing?<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> You're driving them crazy.<br> You realize that?<br> They think you're some kind<br> of goddamn German!<br> I love it! Goddamn, I love it!<br> Give them hell, Jack. Give them hell.<br> - Is that a sarsaparilla with ice?<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> You bet your sweet patoosie,<br> that's sarsaparilla with ice.<br> Why wouldn't John Wheeler<br> know a story if it fell on him?<br> John Wheeler's a dumbbell, that's why.<br> No, he's all right.<br> I just hate to see Louise get hurt.<br> That's all.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Don't tell her that I told you. All right?<br> Told me what?<br> Well, Ben Parsons told me<br> that Wheeler had to let her go<br> because she hadn't turned anything in<br> that he could use,<br> other than some story about a cop<br> that went over there to drive<br> a police department ambulance.<br> - He let her go?<br> - Fired her.<br> - When did you hear that?<br> - A couple of weeks ago.<br> No, it was a month.<br> More than a month and a half ago.<br> Oh, look, Jack,<br> Wheeler's a goddamn moron.<br> Tell her she shouldn't feel ashamed<br> about being fired.<br> - I'm gonna see you later, huh?<br> - Jack, what's the matter?<br> Hell, we've all been fired.<br> I've been fired.<br> Hell, I'll drink to it.<br> Imagine, 65 million<br> go to war. Right?<br> or wounded.<br> You had catastrophe in Europe.<br> You had a holocaust in Europe.<br> You had a desire for change.<br> Who can stop them<br> when there was<br> such a revolutionary sentiment? Huh?<br> Who could stop them?<br> You know, I think I'm gonna have to get<br> a new typewriter...<br> - What are you...<br> - What?<br> You look fine. Are you all right now?<br> Oh, God, yes.<br> Nobody needs two kidneys.<br> The second one's just for show.<br> Sorry, this isn't a very good time.<br> They're moving me<br> to another communications center.<br> So, I'm just not going to be able to<br> talk to you right now, Jack.<br> Could we just go out here a second?<br> Just for a second?<br> - Look, I'm on my way to Russia.<br> - Oh, really? Have you enlisted?<br> Very funny.<br> I know you're doing work here<br> that's good,<br> 'cause I read the ambulance piece<br> and I thought that was good.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And I know you're working on your book<br> and I know how important that is to you.<br> But you got to have enough sense<br> if you're trying to build up<br> your reputation as a journalist,<br> to be in the right place at the right time.<br> - I appreciate your advice.<br> - Well, the place to be now is Russia.<br> - Thank you. I'll remember that.<br> - Louise, it's chaos. They can't last.<br> They're in their third<br> provisional government in six months.<br> You know what that means? It means<br> there might be another revolution.<br> The workers are deserting the factories,<br> the army's deserting the battlefronts.<br> The exiles are all coming back.<br> The Jews, the anarchists, the socialists.<br> All of them are going back,<br> only this time<br> it might be the real thing.<br> And if they have<br> a real workers' revolution in Russia,<br> they'd have one in Germany,<br> and if they had one in Germany,<br> - it could happen all over the world.<br> - Got a match?<br> Louise, that'd be the end of the war.<br> You don't have to tell me<br> what's happening in Russia.<br> - I read the papers.<br> - Well, come with me.<br> As a colleague,<br> I'm not talking about anything else.<br> Come with me as a colleague.<br> You ought to be in Petrograd.<br> Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you said<br> about New York!<br> - I was right about New York.<br> - No, I have work I'm doing here.<br> And I happen to think my work is...<br> It is important. But it's not important as<br> what you could be doing in Russia.<br> I wanna work together. As partners.<br> I don't want a partner. And if<br> I wanted to go to Russia, I'd go alone.<br> - I wouldn't need you to take me.<br> - Louise.<br> Russia is not the safest place<br> in the world for a woman to be alone.<br> You may be a hell of a journalist.<br> But that doesn't mean...<br> Louise, we'd better hurry along.<br> So, moving you out of here, huh?<br> Yes. I've been promised an interview<br> with General Plumer.<br> Well, I've got to run along myself.<br> - Sorry I don't have any time.<br> - No. I don't want to keep you.<br> I just...<br> Look, the seat's already reserved.<br> You've wasted your money, Jack.<br> I don't want it.<br> Change the date. Go by yourself.<br> You can use it whenever you want to.<br> Keep up the good work.<br> Jack.<br> Good luck.<br> Yeah, you, too.<br> I got a taxi waiting.<br> Jack! Jack Reed!<br> - Joe, Joe Volski.<br> - How are you?<br> Oh, fine, fine.<br> Are you going to Petrograd, too?<br> - Yes. Yeah.<br> - Fine. Wonderful!<br> Great things are happening.<br> Are you traveling by yourself?<br> - I think I am.<br> - Well, then I'll switch.<br> We met in Chicago.<br> Boy, oh, boy. Were you a speaker!<br> You don't remember me, eh?<br> Well, it's not that.<br> - Maybe I just... Maybe it's the hat.<br> - My hat?<br> Yeah. Maybe I just don't recognize you<br> in this particular hat.<br> Oh, then I'm a revolutionary<br> returning in disguise.<br> Well, comes the revolution,<br> I'll buy you a new hat.<br> - I see you're studying Russian.<br> - Yeah. I'm trying to.<br> Know what?<br> - What?<br> - I mean,<br> ask me anything you want in Russian.<br> Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.<br> Let's see...<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me, now here's the thing.<br> I'd be a goddamned fool not to take you<br> up on this offer. So, here's what I want.<br> I want to sign my own name<br> to my own stories<br> and I don't want to use a double byline.<br> I want to be responsible<br> for my own time and my own actions.<br> I want to be referred to as Miss Bryant,<br> and not as Mrs. Reed,<br> and I want to keep an account<br> of every cent we spend<br> so that I can pay you back.<br> Now, I assume you know that<br> I'm not going to sleep with you,<br> so just don't confuse the issue<br> by bringing it up.<br> That's it.<br> - Fine.<br> - Good.<br> You like salami?<br> He says,<br> "Wait a minute, I have to go back.<br> "I forgot my teeth on the table."<br> He says, "Hell with your teeth!<br> "What do you think,<br> they're bombarding with sandwiches?"<br> After the revolution,<br> you'll buy me a new hat.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'll keep you by your word.<br> By the way, did you hear this one?<br> A man...<br> Lenin asks,<br> "Why do you let your beard grow?"<br> I says, "I want to remember<br> what I ate yesterday."<br> This is a hard word,<br> but it means "I don't smoke."<br> Okay.<br> "Are you one of the family?"<br> He said, "No. That's why I'm crying."<br> There's a foreman of a logging camp,<br> he's trying to hire a crew.<br> You know, and he goes down<br> a long line of very big men<br> and he gets to a little man in the back<br> and he says, "Who the hell are you?<br> What're you doing here?<br> "Don't you know that I need men who<br> can chop down dozens of trees a day?<br> "Where the hell<br> have you ever worked before?"<br> And the little man says,<br> "Well, I worked in the Sahara forest."<br> And the foreman says,<br> "You mean the Sahara Desert."<br> And the little man says,<br> "Yes, sure, now!"<br> A woman knocks at the door<br> of her neighbor.<br> I didn't tell you that?<br> She says, "My husband just died.<br> I want to sell his jacket."<br> He says,<br> "What's the matter with the pants?"<br> She says, "The pants, I wear."<br> The Russian border.<br> The Russian border.<br> He's already fighting for three months.<br> Now he joined the Bolsheviks<br> and he's not going to fight anymore.<br> I don't think he's afraid.<br> There are many Bolsheviks in the army.<br> And the Bolsheviks will stop the war.<br> He's 14 years old.<br> The Communists obviously wanted<br> peace. Rightly so.<br> Because the country was completely<br> unable to sustain a war.<br> There was treason<br> and there was corruption.<br> There was everything under the sun.<br> But certainly...<br> There was certainly no possibility<br> of conducting a war.<br> Kerensky was anxious to conduct it,<br> produce some battalions of women<br> who were going to go and fight.<br> Jack Reed!<br> Alex, what the hell are you doing here?<br> - You have someone to meet you?<br> - No.<br> Then what luck I am here!<br> - Lois?<br> - Yes.<br> Alex Gomberg.<br> - Looking for accommodation?<br> - No. Just a hotel.<br> More good luck.<br> I know of an empty apartment.<br> You have transportation?<br> No problem. Follow me.<br> A lot of people had an idea<br> that Utopia was growing up.<br> I could not blame them<br> for being pro-Bolshevik,<br> but I wasn't.<br> The one person<br> who was awfully ignorant about Russia<br> - was Beatrice Webb.<br> - Yes, she was.<br> She didn't know a thing.<br> Do not be misled by the quiet<br> in the streets.<br> Underneath is great tension.<br> Alex, how much time<br> has the Kerensky government got left?<br> Any day now, the Bolsheviks will strike.<br> Fantastic, isn't it?<br> A quiet street,<br> and yet we are in the heart of Petrograd.<br> Give him four rubles.<br> Jack, Lois. Lucky for you, I am here.<br> Yeah. Thanks. Thanks again.<br> Only one bed? That's a double.<br> Single. That's a single!<br> This is where I'II...<br> This is good for me. I can just...<br> Good.<br> I don't mind this at all.<br> He's calling for an insurrection,<br> isn't he?<br> Day and night. Day and night.<br> "Another insurrection will ruin Russia."<br> "Another insurrection will save Russia."<br> "The war is ruining Russia."<br> "Without England or France,<br> Russia will be isolated."<br> "The Bolsheviks are ruining Russia."<br> Lois, lucky for you, I am here.<br> Louise.<br> - This is the line for bread.<br> - Yes.<br> There's another line for boots.<br> And there is still another line for cards<br> on which they'll get the boots<br> in two, three months.<br> Did we have to get rid of the czar<br> to stand in line for bread?<br> - What does that mean?<br> - I don't know.<br> Vosstanie means "Insurrection,"<br> and "Kerensky" means "Kerensky,"<br> and Bolsheviki means Bolshevik.<br> So I think it calls for an insurrection<br> by the Bolsheviks<br> against the Kerensky government<br> and the kornilovtsy.<br> - What's a kornilovtsy?<br> - Louise, I'm not that fluent in Russian.<br> Look, if they buy this,<br> they're gonna cut you down<br> to 400 or 500 words, aren't they?<br> - That starts out like you got 5,000.<br> - Where would you cut?<br> I'd lose this. I'd lose this.<br> But what's your lead?<br> Oh, I know what you think.<br> You think the strongman line.<br> Well, I just don't know if you're gonna<br> take anybody's breath away<br> with that for a lead. You know?<br> You're right.<br> It's too long, it's too general.<br> And the strongman line<br> is the best lead.<br> You've been right<br> about something else, too.<br> The Bolsheviks will take Russia<br> out of the war.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> "In the streets the talk<br> is of peace and bread.<br> "Neither of which<br> Kerensky has provided."<br> "Everybody knows that<br> something is going to happen,<br> "Everybody knows that<br> something is going to happen,<br> "but nobody knows just what."<br> Yes?<br> I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian.<br> I'm English.<br> "Petrograd does not sleep.<br> "At night, the arguments grow louder<br> and the crowds thicken."<br> "Nobody is satisfied with Kerensky.<br> "The far right wants a strongman,<br> the far left wants peace.<br> "Everyone waits to see<br> what the Bolsheviks will do."<br> "It is not easy to write fairly about<br> the Bolshevik leader Lenin.<br> "He is absorbed, cold,<br> impatient of interruptions."<br> - You're editorializing here.<br> - I never editorialize.<br> - At the end.<br> - You're right. Cut it.<br> What I don't understand is...<br> Why did you take out the piece<br> about the gunshot? It was very good.<br> - It is good, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Put it back in for me.<br> Mr. Zinoviev, do you still feel<br> that the timing is wrong<br> for a Bolshevik insurrection?<br> "I interviewed Zinoviev at Smolny.<br> "He'd been in hiding with Lenin."<br> ...had another whole decade,<br> less than a day.<br> "His style is still that of a man in hiding.<br> "We hear Trotsky speak at Smolny.<br> "If Lenin represents thought,<br> Trotsky represents action.<br> "He is essentially an agitator."<br> "The meeting hall at Smolny<br> was packed. At one point,<br> "someone in the platform<br> asked the comrades not to smoke,<br> "and everybody, including the smokers<br> took up the cry,<br> "'Don't smoke, comrades! '<br> And then they went on smoking."<br> "At the point Trotsky said,<br> 'We are trying to avoid insurrection,<br> "'but if the Kerensky government<br> attacks us,<br> "'we shall answer blow by blow,'<br> "the audience broke into wild cheers."<br> "Lenin is a strange popular leader,<br> a leader purely by virtue of intellect.<br> "Colorless, humorless,<br> uncompromising,<br> "he seems to have<br> none of Trotsky's force of personality<br> "or his gift for phrasemaking,<br> and yet it is Lenin who is the architect."<br> Kerensky is some socialist, huh?<br> "The Winter Palace of the czar, where<br> Kerensky's government holds office,<br> - "is vast and magnificent..."<br> - "It is quiet in the Winter Palace.<br> "There's no sign here<br> of the strikes and lockouts<br> "that convulse Moscow and Odessa.<br> "No evidence that<br> transportation is paralyzed,<br> "that the army is starving<br> and in the big cities, there is no bread."<br> "Kerensky is full of old-world manners<br> and charm, totally unlike Lenin."<br> "'Provisional government will last,'<br> Kerensky said during the interview,<br> "'in spite of the Bolsheviks.'"<br> "He seemed bitter, defensive."<br> since January the 1st.<br> That's 14% of the Russian army.

What's he...<br> What is he saying?<br> Can you tell me what he's saying?<br> He says don't strike.<br> He says it's not right<br> to leave our Russian soldiers<br> at Front without guns.<br> You are a long way from New York.<br> He says that our Russian<br> soldiers at the Front<br> are also strike.<br> That is why they're leaving the Front.<br> What's that?<br> He said that the workers of England,<br> France and America<br> will be left alone to fight Germany.<br> Tell him he doesn't know<br> how many workers<br> in England, France and America<br> are against the war.<br> You lived in New York. Tell him that.<br> You are right, American.<br> Go ahead, you speak.<br> Go ahead.<br> Tell them about your American workers.<br> No, I can't speak here, I don't have<br> any credentials to speak here.<br> - I'm an American...<br> - Credentials? What credentials?<br> Everyone has credentials here.<br> He ask you to speak.<br> Speak. I translate.<br> I only want to say that if you strike,<br> the American workers<br> will not feel betrayed.<br> They're waiting for your example.<br> They're waiting for your leadership.<br> If you refuse to support<br> the capitalist war machine,<br> they will follow your example.<br> And if workers of the world<br> stand together,<br> the war can be stopped.<br> They support you<br> and will join you in revolution!<br> Then, comrades, come rally<br> And the last fight<br> Let us face<br> The Internationale<br> Unites the human race<br> Then, comrades, come rally<br> And the last fight<br> Let us face<br> The Internationale<br> Unites the human race<br> That's how it goes.<br> Porter!<br> Confiscate it.<br> I'll take it with me to Washington<br> on Wednesday.<br> On whose authority?<br> The authority of the Attorney General.<br> All right, pack it up.<br> - Attorney General?<br> - Attorney General of the United States.<br> That's upside down.<br> - Louise!<br> - Max!<br> How are you?<br> Max. Hi!<br> Hi!<br> Oh, God, Louise. You look good!<br> God, whatever you've been doing,<br> you ought to bottle it.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> He's gonna write a great book, Max,<br> and I'm gonna lecture while he's doing it<br> so we can have something to live on.<br> And he's gonna write<br> wherever I'm lecturing.<br> And then we're gonna go back to Croton<br> and he's gonna help me edit<br> my collection of articles<br> on women in the Revolution,<br> and then we're gonna help<br> edit each other's books.<br> No more separations.<br> We've really promised each other, Max.<br> We're really going to get down<br> to living our own lives.<br> It's so moving.<br> God, Max, you should've been there!<br> Well, they took my notes.<br> Every goddamn note I have for my book.<br> Can they do that?<br> Welcome home. Let's go.<br> Come on, come on.<br> We'll get your notes back.<br> You'll write your book.<br> A lot's been happening. Now what<br> the hell is going on here, Jack?<br> I understand you and Louise<br> have decided to be happy?<br> It's a very difficult situation<br> for a country who is conducting a war,<br> when one of its allies has a revolution<br> and the government is changed.<br> The thing that made the furor<br> was that the Russians withdrew,<br> and we lost an ally.<br> We thought the Russians<br> had gone back on us.<br> The Bolshevik Revolution, at the time,<br> was the most single striking<br> event in the history of the times,<br> of the whole era.<br> The complete transformation<br> of Russian society,<br> and the taking over<br> by the peasants and the workers<br> of the machinery of the state.<br> It never had happened before in history.<br> You're a grand old flag<br> You're a high flying flag<br> And forever and e'er may you wave<br> You're the emblem of<br> The land I love<br> The home of the free and the brave<br> Every heart beats true<br> For the red, white and blue<br> Where there's never a boast or brag<br> Should auld acquaintance be forgot<br> Keep your eye on the grand old flag<br> Over There is not till 1918.<br> Over there, over there<br> Send the word, send the word<br> Over there<br> That the Yanks are coming...<br> You know that one.<br> But the other one<br> after Grand Old Flag,<br> or before, was<br> I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.<br> I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy<br> Yankee Doodle...<br> Real live nephew of my Uncle Sam<br> Born on the 4th of July<br> I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart<br> She's my Yankee Doodle joy<br> Yankee Doodle went to London<br> Just to ride the ponies<br> I am the Yankee Doodle boy<br> That was a big hit.<br> - Do you believe in God?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> It's a simple question, Miss Bryant.<br> Now do you want me to repeat it?<br> I'm sorry, for a moment I thought<br> you asked me<br> if I believed there's a God.<br> That is precisely what I asked you.<br> I see. Well, I have no way of knowing.<br> Are you a Christian?<br> I was christened in the Catholic Church.<br> - Well, are you a Christian now?<br> - I suppose I am.<br> Do you believe<br> in Our Lord Jesus Christ?<br> I believe in the teachings of Christ.<br> Am I being tried for witchcraft?<br> Miss Bryant, tell me,<br> are there no decent, God-fearing<br> Christians among the Bolsheviks?<br> Does one have to be God-fearing<br> and Christian to be decent?<br> Senator, the Bolsheviks believe<br> that it's religion, particularly Christianity,<br> that's kept the Russian people back<br> for so many centuries.<br> - Miss Bryant...<br> - lf any of you'd ever been to Russia<br> and seen the peasants,<br> you might think they had a point.<br> On the subject of decency, Senator,<br> the Bolsheviks took power<br> with the slogan, "An end to the war."<br> Within six months, they made good<br> their promise to the Russian people.<br> Now, the present President<br> of the United States of America<br> went to this country in 1916,<br> on a "no war" ticket.<br> Within six months,<br> he'd taken us into the war,<br> and 115,000 young Americans<br> didn't come back.<br> If that's how decent,<br> God-fearing Christians behave,<br> give me atheists anytime.<br> By the way, Senator Overman,<br> in Russia, women have the vote,<br> which is more than you can say<br> for this country.<br> Miss Bryant,<br> do you advocate a Soviet government<br> for this country?<br> No. In this country<br> I don't think it would work.<br> In other words,<br> you mean the Red scare?<br> They got scared, or we got scared?<br> No, we didn't get scared.<br> They were afraid that the unions<br> would grow in strength.<br> A radical movement in America.<br> They were scared.<br> Oh, sure.<br> The Americans, they were frightened<br> to death by it, you know.<br> That it could occur here.<br> Sure. Everybody was in mortal dread<br> of the government descending on them.<br> The FBI or whatever it was,<br> don't you know.<br> We had to expose them.<br> And once they told American people<br> what Communism was...<br> People won't have nothing to do<br> with Communism now.<br> They know what it is.<br> But then, they didn't know.<br> It was a new thing.<br> Public opinion was<br> solidly against anyone<br> who had a good word<br> for the Russian Revolution.<br> But Louise was always communicating<br> what she had experienced.<br> I brought blankets, here,<br> and a heavy coat, here.<br> Chase and Sanborn.<br> Gloves.<br> Thank you, Jack.<br> Everyone else brought me hats.<br> And Louise sends you her best and this.<br> A scarf. Very kind.<br> I'm afraid your time is up.<br> Well,<br> we're going to keep fighting this.<br> Will you tell Max I'd like a picture<br> of myself in the magazine?<br> And under it, I would like the words,<br> "Deported in 1919.<br> "The government of the most<br> powerful country in the world<br> "is afraid of this woman."<br> We're going to get you back, E.G.<br> The revolution needs you.<br> We're gonna get you back.<br> Comrade, I'm not leaving<br> the revolution.<br> In Russia, I'll be joining it.<br> I urged the deportation of all<br> alien Communists.<br> All alien Communists.<br> It's bad enough having<br> a Communist with us,<br> but to have alien Communists<br> who are not citizens,<br> denouncing our form<br> of government and our republic<br> and everything else,<br> they should be deported.<br> And I led a big fight on that<br> for a long while.<br> It wasn't a very healthy atmosphere.<br> So when John Reed came along,<br> well, he was a voice of what I love.<br> He was able to go into the most<br> controversial subject of all,<br> Communism, Bolshevism.<br> He was considered one of the rare<br> persons who could do a thing like that.<br> He knew he was<br> on the threshold of history,<br> and he wrote it that way.<br> - A touch of this...<br> - Jack, I'm back!<br> I'm in here, honey.<br> I talked to Edmund and Alfred today<br> at Liveright's.<br> - What a day it's turned out to be.<br> - Stay out, honey! Stay out, stay out.<br> What are you doing in there?<br> Is everything okay?<br> - Can't I help?<br> - No, no, no, no!<br> Sure smells good. What is it?<br> Stay out, honey.<br> What did Edmund have to say?<br> Stay out, honey.<br> What did Edmund have to say?<br> He said in a few weeks<br> the steelworkers will strike.<br> He thinks at least 200,000 of them,<br> and maybe as many as 300,000.<br> But he doesn't think there's<br> any stopping them this time.<br> Yeah? That's good.<br> You still thinking<br> about doing a piece on it? I am.<br> Well, I can't really talk now,<br> but what does he say the next step is?<br> Evidently the federal government's<br> saying the steel organizers are Reds.<br> So what they're doing is<br> forming a bureau of investigation<br> just to look into subversive activity.<br> And you know, with all this talk<br> about the leadership of the AF of L<br> being in cahoots with the Steel Trust,<br> Alfred asked me if I was still gonna do<br> the piece on the IWW.<br> So I said, "Alfred, for the moment<br> I don't want to go any further away<br> - "than New Jersey."<br> - Really?<br> Oh, that's good. That's good.<br> - Just...<br> - Yeah, it is good.<br> Sit down. I'll just be a minute.<br> Jack, what are you doing?<br> - How did you leave it with Edmund?<br> - He's gonna read the piece on Debs.<br> Okay, the first course.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Sit down.<br> Sit down and close your eyes. Sit down.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, my.<br> My...<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Oh.<br> What do you think?<br> Really? You serious?<br> Really? Thank God.<br> I was gonna flamb them out here,<br> but the goddamn things flambed<br> themselves in the pan.<br> He was certainly the main inspiration<br> in the development<br> of a revolutionary movement<br> through his history<br> of Ten Days That Shook The World.<br> Ten Days That Shook The World<br> was, of course, his masterpiece.<br> He was there when<br> the Bolshevik Revolution took place.<br> And his was the best report of it.<br> Max Eastman had this story<br> that John Reed came down,<br> tousled hair all, you know...<br> And said he was writing a book<br> and not to disturb him for ten days.<br> And that became<br> Ten Days That Shook The World.<br> Supposedly.<br> He was an enormous,<br> enormous success,<br> and this success<br> largely changed his whole life, I think,<br> 'cause he found out there was<br> something that he could do well,<br> do practically better than anyone else.<br> "Comrades, we have made<br> a great stride forward in our program<br> "to capture<br> the Socialist Party for Revolution.<br> "The time of right-wing domination<br> of the party has ended.<br> "They have fallen before the shining<br> example of revolutionary Russia<br> "like so many bowling pins!<br> "Comrades, we have done better<br> than we could have dreamed.<br> "The left wing has won 12<br> of the 15 seats<br> "on the Socialist Party Executive,<br> "including myself,<br> Edmund MacAlpine and Jack Reed."<br> He took a tremendous jump forward<br> from there on.<br> He became a revolutionist<br> on the workers' side,<br> and he had no more illusions<br> about people like Wilson.<br> We all have problems.<br> You can't escape having problems,<br> don't you know?<br> But to take on the problem<br> of all humanity,<br> to save all humanity,<br> my God, that was too big<br> even for Jesus Christ.<br> Don't you know<br> he got himself crucified?<br> How the hell do we expect<br> to do those things?<br> Oh.<br> Louise. Is that you?<br> Hello, Harry.<br> Well, where have you been lately?<br> I haven't seen you in a long time.<br> That's right.<br> Is this thing gonna last all day?<br> It might. We've been kicked out.<br> - Kicked out of what?<br> - The Socialist Party.<br> - Wait, wait. Who got kicked out?<br> - Everybody in that room.<br> The Executive Committee<br> kicked us all out.<br> - The whole left wing?<br> - That's right. They nullified the election.<br> - Can they do that?<br> - They've done it.<br> We're the majority. We have the votes.<br> We weren't expelled<br> by the membership.<br> We were expelled by the executives.<br> And you're talking about doing exactly<br> what the Executive Committee<br> wants us to do.<br> Give the party back to them<br> without a fight!<br> Yes! And organize our own party!<br> Goddamn it, Louis,<br> the Socialist Party is our own party!<br> We were voted into power<br> by its membership<br> and we can't be expelled<br> by the executives.<br> It's an illegal act, and if we fight it<br> at the convention, we'll win.<br> Why do we have to fight?<br> What do you mean,<br> "Why do we have to fight?"<br> For what do we stay in a party<br> in which we must win control<br> from the minority, not once, but twice?<br> Well, what is it, Louis? You mean,<br> if we must fight for what we deserve,<br> then to hell with it?<br> Is that your idea of revolution?<br> I'd like to hear more about<br> your revolutionary concept, Louis.<br> My idea of revolution<br> is not a revolution in my own party!<br> And my idea of a socialist party<br> is not a debating society!<br> It is a party of action!<br> Fine! Fine.<br> The best example we can give them<br> is go to that convention<br> and take control of the party!<br> No! We form our own party!<br> And I hope that everybody here<br> who believe in Bolshevism<br> will be there that night<br> to help found that party!<br> All right, but I say you're wrong,<br> and I say that I'm gonna be there<br> at that Socialist Party convention<br> to take the seat that belongs to me,<br> and I urge everyone here today<br> to be there to take the seats<br> that belong to you!<br> It's almost like they want to be<br> separated from the masses.<br> They do want to be separated<br> from the masses. That's the point.<br> Let's go.<br> I've been in a minority before.<br> Hello.<br> While he liked the draft manifesto,<br> he's a bit nervous<br> about the social-patriot clause.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Tactically, he's gonna be trouble.<br> Is he gonna bring his people<br> to the convention or not?<br> The man will talk theory<br> with you all year.<br> Well, I don't think so.<br> He'll go with Fraina.<br> Isn't that nice? He likes the manifesto.<br> How about Carnofsky?<br> I don't think we're gonna have<br> as much support as we thought, Jack.<br> We're gonna get in.<br> What did Carnofsky say?<br> - Carnofsky said no.<br> - I'm telling you, Jack...<br> - Just knowing on our own...<br> - Half of Fraina's people would come...<br> Come in!<br> Louise, please keep her quiet, will you?<br> - Hi, Eddie.<br> - How can...<br> - Hello, Eddie.<br> - Hello, Louise, Ben.<br> Hey.<br> Eddie, what about Levine?<br> - Eddie?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What did Levine say?<br> - He never showed. He...<br> I waited over an hour.<br> - Levine didn't show.<br> - That doesn't sound like Levine.<br> Sure it does. Where were you meeting?<br> In Casey's.<br> Now, that surprises me.<br> That really surprises me.<br> I could have missed him.<br> It was really busy in there.<br> - You could have missed him?<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> I was late.<br> How late?<br> Forty, forty-five minutes.<br> Nora started spitting up blood<br> again this morning.<br> I had to take her to the clinic,<br> and I had to wait for my mother<br> to come and pick up the kid.<br> So you were 45 minutes late.<br> Yeah. I thought I could make it.<br> I really did.<br> All right, we gotta get in touch<br> with the guy. How do we do it?<br> He's on his way to Chicago.<br> That's one of the reasons<br> I thought he would still be there.<br> Wait a minute,<br> you thought he'd still be there?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who asked for the meeting, Eddie?<br> - Who asked for the meeting?<br> - Who asked for the meeting?<br> - Did Levine want the meeting?<br> - Yeah, I thought he wanted it.<br> Did he call us?<br> No. We called him.<br> Then why would he wait?<br> We wanted the meeting.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well, why didn't you call one of us<br> and get somebody to take your place?<br> Because I thought I could make it.<br> I mean, I thought the man<br> would still be there.<br> You thought, you thought, you thought.<br> Try not to think too much, Eddie.<br> Not when your comrades<br> are depending on you.<br> Be sure.<br> All right, look.<br> Do we have a contact<br> for Levine in Chicago?<br> Let's call Singer.<br> - Do you have a number for him?<br> - Yeah. Well, I've probably got it.<br> Here.<br> Thanks.<br> You know, they might work better<br> if you put something in your stomach<br> besides coffee.<br> You're a little hard on Eddie,<br> aren't you, under the circumstances?<br> You think my sympathies<br> can help Eddie's wife?<br> Might help Eddie.<br> Listen to me.<br> Building a party will help Eddie.<br> Four, eight, twelve...<br> You know, I think we all believe<br> in the same things.<br> But with us,<br> it's more or less our good intentions.<br> And with Jack, it's a religion.<br> Our old friend Jack's<br> getting serious on us.<br> Okay. Hey, Frank, how are you?<br> How are you?<br> Excuse me. What's happening here?<br> No one's admitted without a red card.<br> That's the order of the Executive.<br> Well, I'm on the Executive,<br> so is he, so is he...<br> - No one's admitted without a red card.<br> - Where do we get the red cards?<br> You'll have to take that up<br> with the Credentials Committee.<br> And where's<br> the Credentials Committee?<br> And where's<br> the Credentials Committee?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't think he wants us to go in there.<br> Well, the way to take the hall<br> is to take the hall.<br> Edmund!<br> Edmund! Jack!<br> Okay. Let's go. Let's go.<br> Come on, this way!<br> To propose the agenda,<br> I would like to read a message<br> from the Credentials Committee<br> to the floor.<br> May we please have order back there?<br> In the back of the hall, could we have...<br> Sergeant-at-arms, would you see<br> what's going on back there?<br> Ladies and gentlemen, it seems<br> we have a group of intruders<br> who are trying to take over<br> this conference.<br> We're not going to let them.<br> Now, please, please sit down.<br> I need these aisles clear.<br> Sergeant-at-arms,<br> I must have these aisles clear!<br> Please, everyone, sit down.<br> Now, these are Bolshevik sympathizers<br> who are trying to take over this party,<br> and we're not going to let them.<br> The police are coming.<br> These people aren't socialists.<br> These people are just thugs!<br> Now you see? That is Bolshevik tactics!<br> Come on, delegates.<br> These people are imposters!<br> They were not elected<br> to the leadership of this party.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the police are coming!<br> - You see? The police.<br> - What the hell is this?<br> That's the only way the Executive<br> Committee can stay in power,<br> is by the use of the capitalist police.<br> Flash your red cards!<br> They'll resort to any tactics<br> to keep the working class<br> away from its true leadership<br> because they're afraid of revolution!<br> Officers, whoever has no red card<br> does not belong in this room.<br> Hold up your red cards.<br> It's all right. We're going.<br> You don't have to throw us out.<br> If you want to know<br> where the true leadership<br> of the Socialist Party of America is,<br> it'll be in the basement of this building<br> in five minutes...<br> - Red cards, everybody!<br> ...and you're welcome to join us.<br> I want anybody who does not have<br> a red card to be out of this hall.<br> Comrade Chairman, I move that<br> we immediately constitute ourselves<br> as the bona fide Communist party,<br> and that we call ourselves<br> the Communist Labor Party of America.<br> I second that motion!<br> Well, look, if we're gonna have<br> a really revolutionary party,<br> I think what we have to do<br> is to find out from the American worker<br> what he wants the most and then<br> we have to translate it back to him<br> in terms of the labor movement<br> as a whole.<br> What we have to do<br> is make him want more.<br> We have to make him want<br> the whole goddamn revolution.<br> Those people upstairs<br> think that Karl Marx was somebody<br> who wrote a good antitrust law.<br> And whether we call our party<br> the Socialist Labor Party<br> or the Real Socialist Communist...<br> Whatever we call the party,<br> it doesn't matter because it...<br> Hello, Lou, are you lost?<br> No. I'm not lost.<br> I'm here to tell my friends<br> that the newly-formed<br> Communist Party of America<br> is meeting at the Russian Federation<br> on Blue Island Avenue.<br> We welcome your applications.<br> They will be judged<br> on an individual basis.<br> You're gonna judge our applications?<br> We're gonna apply to you<br> for membership?<br> Comrade Chairman,<br> I'd like to call that question, please.<br> The motion has been made<br> and seconded that<br> we immediately constitute ourselves<br> as the bona fide Communist party<br> and that we call ourselves<br> the Communist Labor Party of America.<br> All those in favor,<br> please signify by saying aye.<br> Aye!<br> Opposed? Motion is carried.<br> Comrades! Comrades!<br> Comrades, this is the wrong time<br> to be fighting against one another.<br> We should be united in our struggle<br> against the capitalists.<br> You should have thought of that<br> six weeks ago, Louis.<br> If your people had stayed with us,<br> we'd have had a majority,<br> and we'd be in control<br> of that convention upstairs.<br> We have five times your membership!<br> Louis, your arithmetic's<br> something like your politics.<br> We will be at the Russian Federation<br> on Blue Island Avenue.<br> I hope to see some of you there.<br> Comrade Chairman, I move we<br> immediately send a delegate to Moscow<br> to gain recognition by the Comintern<br> for the Communist Labor Party<br> of America,<br> - and that delegate be Jack Reed.<br> - Second the motion!<br> The motion has been made<br> and seconded to send Jack Reed<br> to Moscow immediately<br> as the international delegate<br> to obtain recognition of the Comintern<br> for the Communist Labor Party<br> of America.<br> All those in favor,<br> please signify by saying aye.<br> Aye!<br> Opposed? Motion is carried.<br> Since the first question<br> I'm going to be asked...<br> All right, thank you.<br> All right, comrades, since<br> the first question I'm gonna be asked<br> by the Comintern is gonna be<br> about membership eligibility,<br> I think I'm gonna have to be very clear<br> what our position is<br> in relation to<br> the Foreign Language Federation.<br> I'm gonna have to say exactly<br> what our requirements are<br> as opposed to any other group,<br> and I think we'll have to make it clear<br> on our Platform Committee<br> and be very clear in the manifesto.<br> - Good luck in Moscow, Jack!<br> - Okay, Harry.<br> Well, I guess you boys think<br> you can run a newspaper without me.<br> Hello, Jessie.<br> Good girl.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Let me make it easy for you, Jack.<br> I'm not going with you.<br> And if you go, I'm not sure I'll be here<br> when you get back.<br> Louise, you know, the Comintern<br> doesn't know Edmund or Alfred<br> from the New York Yankees.<br> They know me.<br> Somebody's got to go over there<br> who's got a background.<br> We'd be back by Christmas.<br> We can't merge with Fraina.<br> We can't deal with him<br> on membership eligibility.<br> He wouldn't accept half of our people.<br> The man is gonna do nothing<br> but alienate himself<br> from any potential<br> broad base of support.<br> He's sociologically isolated,<br> programmatically he's impossible<br> to deal with...<br> You mean he's a foreigner?<br> Don't do that, Louise.<br> Six months ago, you were friends.<br> These people can barely speak English.<br> They don't even want to be integrated<br> into American life.<br> The Foreign Language Federations<br> aren't gonna create Bolshevism<br> in America any more<br> than eating borscht will.<br> Being Russian<br> doesn't make a revolution.<br> Do you think the American workers<br> are gonna be led<br> by the Russian federations?<br> Or an insular Italian like Louis Fraina?<br> He has no possibility<br> of leading a revolution in this country.<br> Unlike you?<br> I'm just saying<br> that the revolution in this country<br> is not gonna be led by immigrants.<br> Revolution? In this country?<br> When, Jack? Just after Christmas?<br> Well, what do you think<br> we could've done with the steel strike<br> if we'd been ready?<br> with a unified theory and program<br> leading 365,000 steelworkers?<br> What it takes is leadership.<br> And we gotta get it<br> by getting recognition from Moscow.<br> - I have to go.<br> - You don't have to go.<br> You want to go. You want to go running<br> all over the world ranting and raving<br> and making resolutions<br> and organizing caucuses.<br> What's the difference<br> between the Communist Party<br> and the Communist Labor Party<br> except that you're running one<br> and he's running the other?<br> - I've made a commitment.<br> - To what?<br> To the fine distinction between<br> which half of the left of the left<br> is recognized by Moscow as<br> the real Communist Party in America?<br> To petty political squabbling between<br> humorless and hack politicians<br> just wasting their time<br> on left-wing dogma?<br> To getting the endorsement<br> of a committee in Russia<br> you call the International<br> for your group of 14 intellectual friends<br> in the basement<br> who are supposed to tell the workers<br> of this country what they want,<br> whether they want it or not?<br> Write, Jack.<br> You're not a politician, you're a writer.<br> And your writing has done more<br> for the revolution<br> than 20 years of this infighting can do,<br> and you know it.<br> You're an artist, Jack.<br> Don't go.<br> Don't run away<br> from what you do the best.<br> Jack.<br> I'll be back by Christmas.<br> I'm going into the city.<br> When do you leave?<br> Tomorrow.<br> - I see.<br> - I'll be back by Christmas.<br> Will you be here?<br> I don't know. I'll see you when I see you.<br> Here. Your passport and papers.<br> Your name's James Gormley.<br> Go now!<br> Well, Mrs. Reed. Sit down.<br> What can I do for you?<br> Hello, Gene. How are you?<br> Fine. And you?<br> I'm fine.<br> Sit down.<br> - How's Jack?<br> - He's fine. He's in Russia.<br> - Is he?<br> - Yes.<br> He's trying to get recognition<br> from the Comintern<br> for the Communist Labor Party.<br> You see, they've split<br> into two different factions.<br> And you?<br> Left alone with your work again?<br> No.<br> Well, actually, yes,<br> but my work is different now.<br> I do a lot of lecturing<br> about what I saw in Russia.<br> Ah, yes, Russia.<br> Russia's been good for you and Jack.<br> Given you a way to meet people,<br> given him a reason to leave home.<br> Russia.<br> Russia.<br> Are you really that cynical,<br> or are you angry with me?<br> I'm really that cynical.<br> Why would I be angry with you?<br> Gene, if you'd been to Russia,<br> you'd never be cynical<br> about anything again.<br> You would have seen<br> people transformed. Ordinary people.<br> Louise, something in me tightens when<br> an American intellectual's eyes shine<br> and they start to talk to me<br> about the Russian people.<br> - Wait...<br> - Something in me says, "Watch it.<br> "A new version of Irish Catholicism<br> is being offered for your faith."<br> - It's not like that.<br> - And I wonder why<br> a lovely wife like Louise Reed<br> who's just seen the brave new world<br> is sitting around<br> with a cynical bastard like me<br> instead of trotting all over Russia<br> with her idealistic husband.<br> It's almost worth being converted.<br> Well, I was wrong to come.<br> You and Jack have a lot of<br> middle-class dreams for two radicals.<br> Jack dreams that he can hustle<br> the American working man,<br> whose one dream is to be rich enough<br> not to have to work,<br> into a revolution led by his party.<br> And you dream that if you discuss<br> the revolution with a man<br> before you go to bed with him,<br> it'll be missionary work rather than sex.<br> I'm sorry to see you and Jack<br> so serious about your sports.<br> It's particularly disappointing<br> in you, Louise.<br> You had a lighter touch<br> when you were touting free love.<br> Boy, you've become quite the critic,<br> haven't you, Gene?<br> Just leaned back and analyzed us all.<br> Duplicitous women who tout free love<br> and then get married,<br> power-mad journalists<br> who join the revolution<br> instead of observing it,<br> middle-class radicals<br> who come looking for sex<br> and then talk about Russia.<br> It must seem so contemptible<br> to a man like you<br> who has the courage to sit on his ass<br> and observe human inadequacy<br> from the inside of a bottle.<br> Well, I've never seen you<br> do anything for anyone.<br> I've never seen you<br> give anything to anyone,<br> so I can understand why you might<br> suspect the motives of those who have.<br> But whatever Jack's motives are, how...<br> I seem to have touched a wound.<br> You're a wounding son of a bitch,<br> and whatever I've done to you,<br> you've made me pay for it.<br> Louise.<br> Jessie!<br> Hey, Jess, come on! Come here, Jess.<br> Jessie, come here.<br> Jessie.<br> Jessie?<br> Jessie?<br> - Oh!<br> - Good evening.<br> By the order of the Attorney General<br> of the United States,<br> A. Mitchell Palmer,<br> I have a warrant here<br> for the arrest of one John Silas Reed.<br> Look upstairs, Frank.<br> - Arrest for what?<br> - Sedition.<br> - Where is he?<br> - What do you mean by sedition?<br> Lady, don't ask me.<br> Ask Woodrow Wilson.<br> Just tell me where he is.<br> I don't suppose there's a chance<br> of you being a Bolshevik agitator,<br> is there?<br> Why don't you just look around,<br> and see how agitated you get?<br> In 1919,<br> there were no more<br> than four or five Americans<br> who got into Russia<br> because the country was surrounded<br> on all sides.<br> You were actually forbidden to go,<br> and you could only go illegally.<br> It was very dangerous<br> to go through Finland.<br> Because the Finns<br> were a White government,<br> and they were bitterly opposed<br> to the Reds.<br> They decided to strangle<br> the revolutionary Bolshevik infant<br> in its cradle.<br> And 16 armies went into Russia<br> from the east and from the west,<br> for the purpose<br> of wiping out the Bolsheviks<br> and wiping out the revolution<br> and restoring Christian civilization<br> to its rightful place.<br> Speak English.<br> Have a lemon.<br> You won't see one for a long time.<br> Thank you. I just want to know<br> if you think that I was clear<br> - in what I said about...<br> - Eminently clear.<br> Salt?<br> - Salt?<br> - For the lemon.<br> Thank you.<br> I see you eat the peel with the lemon.<br> Fights the scurvy. So does the onion.<br> Together, they fight better.<br> You see, what I really wanted to do<br> was ask your frank opinion<br> whether we...<br> You think we'll get the endorsement<br> from the committee.<br> - I ask unofficially, of course.<br> - Unofficially?<br> Unofficially, I don't know.<br> Yeah, well, it's such a...<br> It's a peculiarly American problem<br> and I...<br> - You do think I was clear?<br> - Quite clear.<br> In this case, however, clarity does not<br> necessarily guarantee endorsement.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> In this case, I think perhaps it might.<br> You know, in fact, I don't...<br> What I really want to do<br> is to make a detailed report<br> for the Executive Committee to read<br> on conditions in America.<br> You see, I'd like to deal in that report<br> with the entire history<br> of the American Federation of Labor.<br> I'd like to deal<br> with its support of the war, you see.<br> And I'm gonna talk<br> about the persecution of the IWW,<br> I'm gonna deal with the rise<br> of the patrioteering societies,<br> and the capitulation<br> of leading socialists.<br> - I'm gonna... Am I speaking too quickly?<br> - No, no. Go on.<br> And so I will deal with<br> the rising militancy of American labor.<br> I'll talk about the general strikes<br> in Seattle and Winnipeg,<br> the Boston police strike.<br> I'm gonna discuss the Plumb Plan,<br> and particularly the attitude<br> and the policies of the AF of L<br> and IWW toward them.<br> Now, after that, I think it's important...<br> Comrade Reed, the Executive<br> Committee of the Comintern<br> has decided against endorsing<br> either the Communist Labor Party<br> or the Communist Party of America,<br> and instructs the two parties<br> to merge forthwith.<br> Sit here, Comrade Reed.<br> This time, your usual chair,<br> as you can see,<br> is now occupied by your detailed report<br> on American conditions.<br> A most penetrating study.<br> Very, very clear.<br> Thank you.<br> Obviously, it wasn't clear enough.<br> Comrade Radek,<br> I think there must have been<br> some mistake<br> about my travel arrangements<br> about my return to the United States.<br> Well, it seems as if I've been asked<br> to report to the Propaganda Bureau.<br> That is right.<br> Comrade Reed,<br> the Executive Committee has decided<br> you are very much needed<br> at the Propaganda Bureau.<br> We plan for you to remain<br> in Soviet Russia until July.<br> You're very welcome<br> to the Bureau of Propaganda.<br> Well, thank you very much,<br> but I thought that these<br> travel arrangements had been made.<br> I have to get to the Latvian<br> or the Finnish border.<br> And to which border would you suggest,<br> Comrade Reed?<br> Well, I understand that train travel<br> is very dangerous at the moment...<br> Why does he need a train?<br> Because I have urgent personal<br> considerations and responsibilities<br> - in the United States and I...<br> - Of what nature?<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Of what nature?<br> - I have a family.<br> - We all have families.<br> Well, I can speak only for myself<br> and I must see my wife.<br> It's very urgent,<br> and I ask only<br> for a single place on a train.<br> But you have a place on the train!<br> You have a place<br> on the train of this revolution.<br> You have been like so many others,<br> the best revolutionaries.<br> One of the engineers<br> on the locomotive of this train<br> that pulls this revolution<br> on the tracks of historical necessity<br> laid out for it by the party.<br> You can't leave us now.<br> We can't replace you.<br> - What right do you have you to leave...<br> - I'm not sure.<br> To do what? To see your wife?<br> Last year at the International Congress<br> I learned that my son<br> was very ill of typhus.<br> I didn't go to see my son<br> because I knew I was needed<br> where I was placed by the party.<br> What you don't understand is...<br> Would you like to abandon this moment<br> in your life?<br> Would you ever get this moment again?<br> - I am not abandoning the revolution!<br> - Comrade Reed, you're a writer.<br> People know and respect your work.<br> - You speak with authority of feeling.<br> - Comrade Zinoviev,<br> for the past eight weeks,<br> I've been completely unable<br> to communicate with my wife<br> or with my comrades<br> in the United States.<br> I need to go back. I would like your help.<br> Comrade Reed, you can always go back<br> to your private responsibilities,<br> so can I.<br> You can never, never come back<br> to this moment in history.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I have no right to tell you<br> about your own life.<br> You know it better than I do.<br> Maybe it was impossible<br> to get out of Russia.<br> There was White armies all around,<br> so escape was not dreamt of.<br> We had a communication from Jack.<br> He was in prison in Finland<br> where he couldn't communicate freely.<br> But he got word out to me<br> to take a message to Louise.<br> And I remember walking over to Louise,<br> she lived right near me.<br> I walked over to Louise's apartment<br> on Patson Place,<br> and spent an evening with her<br> talking about Jack,<br> and she talked very earnestly<br> about Jack's plight.<br> Mrs. Reed, the United States<br> cannot involve itself<br> in the internal affairs of Finland.<br> Are you trying to tell me<br> the American Consul<br> - can't give you any information?<br> - I'm afraid that there's nothing<br> - that the State Department can do.<br> - Don't give me that garbage.<br> If his name were Rockefeller,<br> there'd be something you could do.<br> Mrs. Reed, if your husband's name<br> were Rockefeller,<br> I think he would hardly be<br> under indictment<br> for a conspiracy to overthrow<br> the United States Government.<br> He has only one kidney.<br> He could be dangerously ill.<br> That is a chance<br> that your husband took, Mrs. Reed,<br> when he left the United States<br> without an exit visa or a passport.<br> Good day, Mrs. Reed.<br> The United States<br> participated with the Allies<br> in military expeditions against<br> the Soviet Union<br> in an attempt to overcome them,<br> invade them,<br> and set up another government.<br> Oh, yes. Yes.<br> There was a noose<br> to be pulled around Russia<br> which gave you an idea<br> of how a whole country<br> can be surrounded<br> east, west, south, and north.<br> Your name,<br> and the name of your contact in Finland.<br> Your name,<br> and the name of your contact in Finland.<br> I don't know what color...<br> I'll just get it myself.<br> - Would you get some...<br> - Would you like us to do it now?<br> - Okay.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> - All right.<br> - I understand.<br> From the top?<br> Oh, I see. Then they made a map.<br> Terry spoke to me.<br> Louise, I don't think you realize<br> how difficult this trip to be for a woman.<br> You'd have to stow away.<br> If you got there at all,<br> it would take you six months to...<br> Terry said that he thought that<br> you could arrange a freighter for me<br> - as far as Norway.<br> - Don't know why you're saying it.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Sit down.<br> I want to talk to you about something.<br> ...indicates the map.<br> I could go.<br> I can sign on as a seaman.<br> There'd be no questions asked.<br> I think under the circumstances...<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> Jack Reed's a friend of mine.<br> I'm not gonna let<br> the son of a bitch rot in jail.<br> Just seemed to me<br> that I'm not as interested...<br> ...and at this point...<br> Okay.<br> Wasn't he supposed to come over<br> to me on this?<br> I'll talk to Terry in the morning.<br> Where the cross is made...<br> I wish these son-of-a-bitches could act.<br> Your blood pressure is very high.<br> They only give me<br> some kind of salted fish.<br> The blood in your mouth<br> is from the gums.<br> You have scurvy.<br> An impressive shade of red, comrade.<br> Could you send a cable to my wife?<br> Mr. Reed, I have something for you.<br> - Is there a cable?<br> - There's nothing yet.<br> You should take one of these powders<br> in a glass of water, once a day.<br> Has she sent word to me here?<br> They won't say.<br> Our people can find out nothing.<br> You are being released.<br> You know, I must tell you,<br> I lost sight of John Reed completely.<br> But what I heard was<br> the Bolsheviki traded<br> some Finnish professors<br> for the release of John Reed.<br> John Reed.<br> We are here to welcome you.<br> Could you take me<br> to the telegraph office?<br> - Yes. Get in.<br> - Thank you.<br> "Louise Bryant, Croton-on..."<br> Hudson.<br> "...Hudson, New York, USA.<br> "I'm safe. Stop."<br> "Please contact..."<br> Contact. Please contact.<br> "Contact Petrograd telegraph office.<br> Stop.<br> "Have received no word from you. Stop.<br> "Please for... Forgive..."<br> Please forgive Christmas.<br> "Please forgive Christmas. Stop.<br> Love, Jack."<br> Could you send that right away?<br> Comrade Lenin said<br> he would trade,<br> for John Reed, fifty professors.<br> "Louise Bryant, Croton-on-Hudson,<br> "New York, USA."<br> - USA.<br> - "USA. Immediate."<br> - Immediate return...<br> - "Immediate return..."<br> - ... United States...<br> - "...United States..."<br> - ... impossible.<br> - "...impossible."<br> - Louise Bryant, Croton...<br> - Croton.<br> - "Croton-on..."<br> - Croton-on-Hudson.<br> "Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.<br> "Still no word from you. Stop.<br> Have no fixed address. Stop."<br> "Louise Bryant.<br> Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.<br> "Must know, are you well? Stop."<br> - "Do not..."<br> - Do not understand.<br> "Do not understand<br> why no word from you. Stop."<br> "Louise Bryant.<br> Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.<br> - "Need..."<br> - Need word.<br> "Need word from you. Stop.<br> Do not understand your silence. Stop"<br> "Louise Bryant. Croton-on-Hudson,<br> - "New York, USA."<br> - Did you check R-E-A-D?<br> Yes. Yes.<br> And you checked R-E-l-D also?<br> I have looked R-E-l-D,<br> R-E-A-D,<br> R-E-D.<br> I have looked Goldman and Bryant.<br> I'm just... Excuse me. One second.<br> Lf, if...<br> I thought maybe there's some other way<br> of misspelling the name.<br> - You also looked under R-E-l-D?<br> - Yes, Comrade Reed.<br> - Yes, yes. What do you want?<br> - There's many people wait.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Lf something come, we'll notify you.<br> What have you heard?<br> Not much. What have you heard?<br> I don't hear. I wait.<br> They've jailed more anarchists.<br> But they made Bill Shatoff<br> head of the Siberian railway.<br> They treated me very well,<br> and I'm reserving my judgment.<br> - Well, that's wise.<br> - There's so much I don't understand.<br> There are forests within easy reach<br> of Petrograd.<br> Why is this city freezing?<br> I asked Zinoviev.<br> He said our enemies have destroyed<br> all the means of transportation<br> and killed off our horses<br> as well as our men.<br> How would we get at it?<br> I said, "What about<br> the people of Petrograd?<br> "They could go there together on foot<br> and haul the wood back with ropes."<br> He said, "Oh, yes, it would make<br> the people warmer,<br> "but it would interfere with the carrying<br> out of the main political policy."<br> - You get letters from America, E. G?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> All opened by the Justice Department.<br> I hope they enjoy what they read. I don't.<br> So I asked him,<br> "What are the main political policies?"<br> He said,<br> "Concentration of all power in the hands<br> "of the proletarian avant-garde.<br> "The avant-garde of the revolution,<br> which is the Communist Party."<br> Anybody mention Louise?<br> I don't think so.<br> You haven't heard from her?<br> I've sent her cables,<br> but I don't get any answer.<br> - For how long?<br> - A long time.<br> Wait.<br> Rhys Williams<br> mentioned her in his letter.<br> He hasn't heard from her, either.<br> What'd he say?<br> I think he said<br> that he'd tried to reach her<br> sometime after Christmas,<br> but she'd left New York.<br> How long ago was that?<br> Well, you know how these letters take<br> a couple of months to get here.<br> By the time I get them, whoever sent it<br> is either in jail or deported.<br> - That's it.<br> - Which?<br> - There.<br> - Rhys Williams.<br> Oh.<br> - First the eyes go, then the legs.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I don't understand<br> the fuel situation, either.<br> I don't know...<br> He says she seems to be out of town.<br> That's all he said?<br> Yeah.<br> What did he say about O'Neill?<br> O'Neill? Nothing.<br> Come on, what did he say?<br> Nothing.<br> Can I see it?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I just don't know where...<br> Jack, sit down.<br> If Louise were to come here,<br> she'd have to leave<br> the United States illegally,<br> then live in exile with you,<br> and never go home again.<br> All for the sake of a revolution<br> she was never any part of.<br> Why should she?<br> You chose the life of a revolutionary.<br> She didn't.<br> Your cables only focus the<br> Justice Department's attention on her,<br> and the most seditious thing<br> they can accuse her of<br> is being your wife.<br> Leave her alone.<br> Let her choose her own future.<br> Why hasn't she answered me?<br> I think she has answered you.<br> He's been released.<br> They won't tell me where he is.<br> Do you know, she was much hated<br> for her extravagance in clothes.<br> Well, a long time ago,<br> somebody said to me,<br> "People who...<br> "Women whose lives<br> have been in danger<br> "over a long period<br> are always the most extravagant."<br> Comrades, as wrong-headed<br> as many of its policies are,<br> the IWW is a revolutionary union<br> and the American Federation of Labor<br> is not.<br> To think we can infiltrate<br> the American Federation of Labor<br> and convert it<br> to revolutionary policies is hopeless.<br> Translation.<br> Comrades, that's the wrong translation.<br> That's not what he said.<br> What's he saying?<br> For us to make a point<br> on the floor of the Congress,<br> we have to go<br> from our own English language<br> into the official German language<br> to the Italian, or Spanish,<br> or French language.<br> - And then, when the response from...<br> - What is your question, please?<br> Simply for the labor union issue,<br> could we have the English language<br> as an official language<br> on the floor of the Congress?<br> Comrade Reed, this is the third time<br> you have raised this proposal!<br> The issue has been decided.<br> We must move on<br> to the national and colonial issues!<br> Real revolutionary workers<br> in the United States<br> quit the AF of L a long time ago<br> and joined the IWW.<br> We have to make<br> the Russians understand this,<br> and that's why we want your support<br> to extend the session of congress<br> and to keep the debate open.<br> Jack, are you okay?<br> - Did you talk to Sadoul?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> Comrades, I'm still opposed to closing<br> the discussion here.<br> I think that this discussion<br> is being closed<br> to avoid hearing the American<br> and the British delegations.<br> And if for no other reason than that,<br> it shows that discussion<br> should continue.<br> Comrade Radek<br> uses this sort of remark<br> in place of an argument and as a result,<br> he doesn't want to talk about it.<br> What Reed says is not distinguished<br> by excessive fear of distorting the truth.<br> He goes on day and night<br> and has the cheek to claim<br> that the discussion is being broken off<br> because of fear of the great might<br> of John Reed.<br> Comrade Reed, you may have time<br> to discuss it until tomorrow morning.<br> Other people do not have the time.<br> Comrade Radek, other people that<br> don't have the time for this discussion<br> are 101 leaders of the IWW<br> who are in jail today<br> in the United States<br> because of their revolutionary views.<br> And if we turn our back<br> on these comrades<br> out of some pipe dream to radicalize<br> the American Federation of Labor<br> which cannot be done, it is a disgrace.<br> We've discussed this<br> during six sessions of this commission.<br> We spent whole day today discussing it,<br> and you insinuate<br> we are trying to dismiss the issue?<br> We haven't had enough discussion...<br> We haven't had enough discussion<br> for my friend here<br> to realize that Louis Fraina and I<br> think alike on this problem.<br> Every American on our delegation,<br> - every man on the English delegation...<br> - You are a member of this committee.<br> You are not<br> an independent political party.<br> Comrade Zinoviev, I will not be<br> steamrollered by this committee<br> that has not had<br> a proper education on this problem.<br> On the fact...<br> The discussion is closed.<br> However, if Comrade Reed<br> wishes to make a statement,<br> he will have two minutes to do so.<br> I would merely want to say that<br> on behalf of the American delegates,<br> that we will refuse<br> to vote on these theses,<br> and that I myself<br> will resign my seat on this committee.<br> Jack, I think we have to face it.<br> The dream that we had<br> is dying in Russia.<br> If Bolshevism means<br> the peasants taking the land,<br> the workers taking the factories,<br> Russia's one place<br> where there's no Bolshevism.<br> You know, I can argue with cops,<br> I can fight with generals.<br> I can't deal with a bureaucrat.<br> You think Zinoviev is nothing worse<br> than a bureaucrat?<br> The Soviets have no more<br> local autonomy.<br> The central state has all the power.<br> All the power<br> is in the hands of a few men<br> and they are destroying the revolution.<br> They are destroying any hope<br> of real Communism in Russia.<br> They're putting people like me in jail.<br> My understanding of revolution<br> is not a continual extermination<br> of political dissenters,<br> and I want no part of it.<br> Every single newspaper's<br> been shut down<br> or taken over by the party.<br> Anyone even vaguely suspected<br> of being a counter-revolutionary<br> can be taken out and shot<br> without a trial. Where does that end?<br> Is any nightmare justifiable<br> in the name of defense<br> against counter-revolution?<br> The dream may be dying in Russia,<br> but I'm not.<br> It may take some time. I'm getting out.<br> You sound like you're a little confused<br> by the revolution in action, E.G.<br> Up to now,<br> you've only dealt with it in theory.<br> What did you think<br> this thing was gonna be?<br> A revolution by consensus<br> where we all sat down<br> and agreed over a cup of coffee?<br> Nothing works.<br> Four million people died last year.<br> Not from fighting a war,<br> they died from starvation and typhus<br> in a militaristic police state<br> that suppresses<br> freedom and human rights<br> where nothing works.<br> They died because of a<br> French, British and American blockade<br> that cut off<br> all food and medical supplies<br> and because counter-revolutionaries<br> have sabotaged the factories<br> and the railroads and the telephones,<br> and because the people,<br> the poor, ignorant,<br> superstitious, illiterate people,<br> are trying to run things themselves,<br> just as you always said that they should,<br> but they don't know<br> how to run them yet.<br> Did you really think things would work<br> right away?<br> Did you really expect<br> social transformation<br> to be anything other than<br> a murderous process?<br> It's a war, E.G.,<br> and we gotta fight it like we fight a war,<br> with discipline,<br> with terror, with firing squads,<br> or we just give it up.<br> Those four million people<br> didn't die fighting a war.<br> They died from a system<br> that cannot work!<br> It's just the beginning, E.G.<br> It's not happening<br> the way we thought it would.<br> It's not happening<br> the way we wanted it to,<br> but it's happening.<br> If you walk out on it now,<br> what's your whole life meant?<br> Could you tell me if my resignation<br> is ready for signature yet?<br> - It is.<br> - Good.<br> May I see it?<br> Thank you.<br> - Thank you, Comrade Reed.<br> - Welcome back, Comrade Reed.<br> Now you'll be able to represent<br> the American workers<br> at the forthcoming congress at Baku<br> to inspire revolution among the peoples<br> of the Middle East.<br> Prepare for a difficult trip.<br> Our only route<br> is through divided territory.<br> Some of these intellectuals<br> spread rumors<br> that he changed his mind afterwards,<br> trying to, you know,<br> show that he came to his senses.<br> It's preposterous.<br> These men, well,<br> I don't even remember them.<br> I don't want to remember them.<br> All trains to Baku canceled<br> because of attacks<br> by counter-revolutionaries.<br> There must be some train to Baku.<br> All trains to Baku canceled<br> because of attacks<br> by counter-revolutionaries.<br> There has to be something to Baku.<br> Louise?<br> Emma?<br> Emma.<br> Emma.<br> How in the name of God<br> did you get into Russia?<br> - I had no idea how long it would take.<br> - So, you'll wait for a while.<br> By the time you got there,<br> he'd be back here anyway.<br> Go on in. Go on in.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> It's all right. It's all right.<br> Here. Louise, sit down. Sit down.<br> I want to tell you something.<br> It's late, I know.<br> I want to thank you for that scarf.<br> Oh, yes.<br> I was wrong about you.<br> So was I.<br> The American oil companies<br> are trying to establish<br> a world monopoly of oil.<br> In 1898, the Filipinos rebelled against<br> the cruel colonial government of Spain.<br> But after the Spaniards<br> had been driven out...<br> The Americans have promised<br> the Filipinos independence.<br> Soon an independent Filipino republic<br> will be proclaimed.<br> The government of United States<br> sent soldiers and sailors there...<br> ...under a dictatorship<br> worse than the British tyrants.<br> What's that for?<br> They are supporting you<br> for your call for a holy war<br> of Islamic people against<br> the western infidels.<br> Excuse me, Comrade Reed.<br> They said you are not happy<br> with the translations of your speech.<br> I did the German into Turkic<br> and Comrade Ossinsky<br> did the Russian into German.<br> Russian?<br> Who turned it into Russian<br> in the first place?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> They were already in Russian<br> when we got them<br> from the office of Comrade Zinoviev.<br> - I'm sorry for my English.<br> - Your English is fine, comrade.<br> Zinoviev, did you do<br> the translations of my speech?<br> I supervised it. Yes.<br> I didn't say "holy war."<br> I said "class war."<br> I took a liberty<br> of altering a phrase or two.<br> Yes, well, I don't allow people<br> to take those liberties with what I write.<br> Aren't you propagandist enough<br> to utilize what moves people most?<br> I'm propagandist enough<br> to utilize the truth.<br> And who defines this truth?<br> You or the party?<br> Is your life dedicated to speaking for...<br> You don't talk about what<br> my life is dedicated to!<br> Your life? You haven't resolved<br> what your life is dedicated to.<br> You see yourself as an artist<br> and at the same time as a revolutionary.<br> As a lover to your wife, but also as a<br> spokesman for the American classes.<br> Zinoviev, you don't think<br> a man can be an individual<br> and be true to the collective,<br> or speak for his own country<br> and the International at the same time,<br> or love his wife<br> and still be faithful to the revolution,<br> you don't have a self to give!<br> Would you ever be willing<br> to give yourself to this revolution?<br> When you separate a man<br> from what he loves the most,<br> what you do is purge<br> what's unique in him.<br> And when you purge<br> what's unique in him,<br> - you purge dissent.<br> - Comrade Reed.<br> And when you purge dissent,<br> you kill the revolution!<br> Revolution is dissent!<br> - Comrade Reed.<br> - You don't rewrite what I write!<br> Comrade Reed, counter-revolutionaries!<br> Counter-revolutionaries,<br> Comrade Reed!<br> Papa!<br> Papa!<br> Don't leave me.<br> Please don't leave me.<br> Comrade, the doctor<br> would like to see you now.<br> The doctor thinks<br> that we must do more analysis.<br> And a picture of his illness<br> will be clearer in a few days.<br> And he wants you to know<br> that we shall do the best conditions<br> for Comrade Reed<br> to prevent possibility<br> of high blood pressure<br> to cause a stroke.<br> I really... I know...<br> What?<br> How are you?<br> No.<br> Jack?<br> You know, I don't... I don't...<br> You hear it?<br> - Huh?<br> - What was that?<br> The water plays little songs.<br> It's not December, is it?<br> My, my, my, my.<br> God. What a time it was, huh?<br> - Want to come to New York with me?<br> - New York?<br> I got a taxi waiting.<br> I wouldn't mind.<br> What as?<br> What as?<br> What as?<br> Gee, I don't know.<br> Comrades?<br> Comrades.<br> Well, I want to go home.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll get you some water.<br> Oh, God.<br> It was in the afternoon,<br> sometime in the fall, I think.<br> October, I think.<br> Somebody came to tell me<br> that Jack Reed died.<br> You can imagine how...<br> How I felt.<br> I'd forgotten all about them.<br> Were they socialists?<br> Many of them were idealists.<br> You know,<br> things go and come back again.<br> I don't know what the outside world<br> thought of them,<br> but they were a couple.<br> I mean, you always spoke<br> of Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.<br> He was just a man in the prime of life.<br> I don't even know.<br> Did they ever have any children?<br> They probably didn't have any children,<br> he and Louise.<br> Again, you can't tell,<br> when you have children,<br> whether they will carry on<br> your revolutionary tradition or not.<br> Why did he do it?<br> Well, it's impossible to say<br> why Edison invented,<br> or why Galli-Curci sang...<br> He was definitely a stirrer-up of people.<br> That was his field.<br> That's what he came to do, apparently.<br> He's well-known amongst a few,<br> but not everybody.<br> They don't know who in heck he is.<br> I look for myself to die any day.<br> He was asked by Lenin,<br> "Are you an American?"<br> He said, "Yes."<br> And Lenin said,<br> "An American American?"<br> And Reed said, "Yes."<br> Of course,<br> nobody goes with the idea of dying.<br> Everybody wants to live.<br> I don't remember his exact words,<br> but the meaning was<br> that grand things are ahead,<br> worth living and worth dying for.<br> He himself said that.<br>
