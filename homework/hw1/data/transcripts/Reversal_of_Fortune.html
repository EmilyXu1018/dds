                        This was my body.<br> On December 27, 1979,<br> I lay in bed all day.<br> Whether I was asleep or in a coma<br> later became a subject of dispute.<br> When my breathing<br> became obstructed...<br> Maria!<br> ... my husband, Claus von Bulow,<br> finally did as my maid<br> had been urging all day:<br> he summoned a physician.<br> Dr. Paultees?<br> I stopped breathing.<br> My heart stopped beating.<br> By this time,<br> I was certainly in a deep coma<br> from which I awoke several hours later.<br> By the next morning,<br> I was myself again.<br> There's no reason for all this fuss.<br> I never felt better in my whole life.<br> This first coma aroused<br> suspicion and fear<br> in the minds of my personal maid Maria,<br> my son Alex,<br> and my elder daughter Ala.<br> From this time on, though they never<br> voiced their suspicions to me,<br> they kept a vigilant eye on Claus.<br> A year later, just before Christmas,<br> their darkest fears seemed justified.<br> - Has Mummy had breakfast yet?<br> - No, we haven't seen her.<br> My husband did not want our daughter<br> Cosima to see what he had found,<br> so he motioned to his stepson Alex.<br> Second coma. My pulse was 38,<br> my temperature 81.6 degrees.<br> Did you call an ambulance?<br> Nicholas, ask Robert to open the main<br> gates. We're expecting an ambulance.<br> Send an ambulance immediately...<br> Keep her in something warm.<br> A blanket or anything you can find.<br> All this activity was pointless.<br> We'd better do an EEG.<br> I never woke from this coma,<br> and I never will.<br> I am what doctors call<br> "persistent vegetative", a vegetable.<br> According to medical experts, I could<br> stay like this for a very long time,<br> brain-dead, body better than ever.<br> Enter Robert Brillhoffer,<br> former Manhattan district attorney.<br> My two children from my first marriage,<br> Alex and Ala von Auersberg,<br> hired Brillhoffer to investigate the case.<br> He put a "do not resuscitate" order<br> on her hospital chart.<br> They sent Alex<br> and a private investigator<br> back to my Newport cottage,<br> Clarendon Court, to search for drugs.<br> They found plenty... in Claus's closet.<br> On top of that, the hospital lab reported<br> that my blood insulin on admission<br> was 14 times normal,<br> a level almost surely caused by injection.<br> Insulin injection could<br> readily cause coma...<br> or death.<br> This encrusted needle<br> tested positive for insulin.<br> Alex couldn't wait to get back<br> and show Brillhoffer.<br> Now they felt they had<br> the murder weapon.<br> All they lacked was the motive.<br> At that moment, my husband<br> was vacationing with his mistress,<br> the very beautiful soap-opera actress,<br> Alexandra Isles.<br> Oh, God!<br> Mrs. Isles, a divorce, was the daughter<br> of an old friend, Count Billy Botsky.<br> Brillhoffer also discovered<br> that, at my death,<br> Claus, whose own net worth<br> was only a million dollars,<br> stood to inherit 14 million from me.<br> Alexandra later testified that Claus<br> showed her a legal analysis of my will.<br> On the evidence collected by Alex,<br> Ala and their lawyer Brillhoffer,<br> my husband was accused of twice trying<br> to murder me with injections of insulin.<br> On March 16, 1982, he was<br> found guilty on both counts.<br> ... committed<br> on December 27, 1979...<br> Even Alexandra Isles<br> testified against him.<br> Guilty.<br> As to count two, charged the defendant<br> committed on December 21, 1980,<br> a crime of assault with intent to murder.<br> - How do you find?<br> - Guilty.<br> You are about to see how<br> Claus von Bulow sought to reverse<br> or escape from that jury's verdict.<br> You tell me.<br> And two! Here it comes. Here we go,<br> taking you downtown! And Dersh...<br> Take it in! Foul! OK, here I go.<br> Watch the hands! Watch the hands!<br> Yeah, hello.<br> What?<br> Oh, shit... Bottom line.<br> Aw, shit!<br> Hi.<br> Let's try that again.<br> Hi, Dad. Remember Maggie?<br> Hi, Maggie.<br> They're gonna fry. The Johnson brothers.<br> What? But...<br> Two black kids broke<br> their father out of prison.<br> The father shot two people:<br> the sons are convicted of murder.<br> A lawyer prays for an innocent client.<br> Finally, I get two.<br> Both of them are gonna get zapped.<br> - No more appeals?<br> - This was the best shot.<br> Whoa. It's the press.<br> You don't want to talk to the press?<br> Dershowitz Psychiatric Institute.<br> Hang on a second.<br> Claus von Bulow.<br> - It's a reporter.<br> - With an English accent?<br> What paper do you represent?<br> If I can't save two innocent kids,<br> what's the point?<br> Yeah, one second. Sorry.<br> He really seems to think he's von Bulow.<br> Hello. This is Alan Dershowitz.<br> Who are you? What do you want?<br> - It is von Bulow.<br> - Back in business.<br> - Can I help you?<br> - Claus von Bulow?<br> Elevators to the left.<br> Holy shit.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Professor Dershowitz. Hello, hello.<br> - How good of you to come.<br> - Pleasure.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> - Do you play?<br> - That? No.<br> Most people think it's a game of luck.<br> Actually, it's largely a matter of nerve.<br> Erm... Nothing, thank you, Charles.<br> Why don't we go to Delmonico's<br> and have a proper lunch?<br> Whatever.<br> I have the greatest respect<br> for the intelligence and integrity<br> of the Jewish people.<br> When I married Sunny, she was<br> the most beautiful divorce in the world,<br> and one of the wealthiest.<br> Even so, we never got this table.<br> Professor Dershowitz.<br> Dr. von Bulow.<br> Two injections of insulin,<br> already I'm a doctor.<br> In America, it's fame rather than class.<br> Now, after all this unpleasantness,<br> I always get the best table.<br> - Speaking of the unpleasantness...<br> - Oh, yes. We'd better discuss your fee.<br> OK. $300 an hour.<br> Good Lord.<br> You know, I used to be a lawyer<br> in London. That sounds a bit steep.<br> It's average for a case like this.<br> Besides, I do a lot of pro bono work.<br> You'd pay for that. Plus,<br> I have to pay students, associates.<br> Are you saying that if I agree to pay 300,<br> you will handle my appeal?<br> No, not so far.<br> Doesn't look like my kind of case.<br> I'm not a hired gun. I gotta feel a moral<br> or constitutional issue is at stake.<br> But I'm absolutely innocent.<br> And my civil liberties have<br> been egregiously violated.<br> Two black kids are facing the electric<br> chair for a crime they did not commit.<br> They are innocent.<br> Well, before you assume I'm guilty,<br> won't you hear my story?<br> No. Never let defendants explain. Puts<br> most of them in an awkward position.<br> - How do you mean?<br> - Lying.<br> But I give you my word as a gentleman.<br> Oh. Well...<br> Won't you at least read the record<br> and see if you can find something...<br> constitutional?<br> You do have one thing in your favor.<br> Everybody hates you.<br> Well, that's a start.<br> Come on, Maxwell.<br> Yeah! Come on, Max.<br> It was a hit! Yes!<br> - So, what do you think?<br> - Oh, he did it. He did it.<br> - Of course he did it. Can we win?<br> - A hundred to one against.<br> The maid schmeared him on both comas.<br> Look at this. It says here...<br> After you realized that Mrs. von Bulow<br> had not gotten up, what did you do?<br> I came downstairs,<br> and Mr. von Bulow said that<br> Madame had a very sore throat,<br> and I didn't have to do any work,<br> and she was in bed all day.<br> What are you doing? Did we ring for you?<br> She's ice-cold.<br> Madame. Mrs. von Bulow!<br> Leave her alone. She's sleeping. She<br> drank last night. We didn't get any rest.<br> She's not sleeping. She's unconscious.<br> - You must call a doctor.<br> - Maria!<br> Go on.<br> A half-hour later,<br> she had not moved.<br> I went back and forth all morning.<br> Finally, mid-afternoon,<br> Mr. von Bulow spoke to Dr. Paultees.<br> But he lied to doctor.<br> She's sleeping now, but earlier she was<br> up to the bathroom and had a soft drink,<br> so there's no cause for alarm...<br> But she never moved.<br> Never got up.<br> She was lying<br> in the same position all day.<br> Later her heart stops, and<br> Dr. Paultees, he comes and saves her.<br> After they go to the hospital,<br> I change the sheets.<br> I find a puddle of urine.<br> If Madame went to the bathroom,<br> she would not have peed in her bed.<br> Right.<br> Why would Claus lie about that?<br> It's suspicious but hardly criminal.<br> How about the second coma?<br> Maria wasn't in Newport for that one.<br> But shortly before the second coma...<br> I'm cleaning up their room<br> when I find Mr. von Bulow's canvas bag<br> packed for Newport.<br> Inside, there's a little black bag.<br> A bottle of insulin,<br> a syringe and needles.<br> Alexander! Alexander, come here!<br> Insulin? For what, insulin?<br> My lady's not diabetic.<br> Three weeks later,<br> Sunny's lying unconscious<br> in a freezing bathroom with<br> her nightgown hiked over her waist.<br> If I was on that jury,<br> I would've voted to convict.<br> Then you're taking the case?<br> Reminds me of my Hitler dream.<br> Hitler calls up, he's alive, needs a lawyer.<br> I say "Sure. Come on over."<br> Then I have to decide:<br> do I take the case or do I kill him?<br> You? No question.<br> - I would take the case.<br> - Then kill him.<br> I'm a maniac. I need your judgment,<br> someone to watch what I'm doing and<br> occasionally remind me about the law.<br> When can I see the transcripts?<br> You're a former prosecutor, conservative.<br> We agree on nothing.<br> But you're smarter than the DA. If I can<br> beat your arguments, I can destroy his.<br> Rhode Island is corrupt. Everything is<br> political. I don't think that way. You do.<br> I have to see the big picture.<br> I can't immerse myself in facts.<br> But we must know the facts.<br> No one can assimilate information<br> as quickly as you two.<br> I agree with that assessment.<br> - You're out of your mind.<br> - I only have 45 days to file.<br> I can't do it without you.<br> - I know you don't wanna come back...<br> - Is this strictly professional?<br> It better be.<br> That's wonderful. I want the best<br> people in the world on our side,<br> the most prestigious experts.<br> Nobel prize-winning scientists,<br> some of your colleagues at Harvard.<br> Wait a minute, Claus.<br> We got a little problem, OK?<br> People like that, we can't control.<br> They find one incriminating fact,<br> they'll tell the world.<br> I'm not afraid, Alan.<br> Let the chips fall where they may.<br> That's what an innocent man would say.<br> I know.<br> That just came for you, Daddy.<br> My daughter Cosima.<br> She never doubted me.<br> She loves Alex and Ala dearly. Siding<br> with me has cost her their affections.<br> I don't know what I would've done.<br> I don't want to hear your story,<br> but I do need some information.<br> Of course.<br> I gather the older children deny Sunny<br> had a problem with pills and alcohol.<br> Spectacular understatement.<br> So there must be somebody<br> who saw it. A witness, a friend?<br> - You want affidavits?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'll get them.<br> - You'll get them.<br> The drugs prescribed for me<br> were taken by Sunny.<br> That's a lot of drugs.<br> But the prosecution's allegation that<br> I knew about syringes, injections -<br> totally accurate.<br> Sunny and I gave ourselves B12 injections<br> in the late '60s. It was quite the fad.<br> Can I explain something? The less I know<br> from you, the more options I have.<br> When you tell me "the truth", you limit me<br> to a defense that fits with what you say.<br> But isn't the truth the simplest way, Alan?<br> I mean, why did I stay all day<br> at Sunny's side without calling a doctor?<br> Because Sunny detested doctors.<br> If we called one without her approval,<br> she went berserk.<br> Once she broke her hip and<br> didn't go to hospital for two days.<br> - Did you hear what I just said?<br> - Did you hear the judge sentence me?<br> Sorry. 30 years is a pretty stiff sentence.<br> Twice trying to murder one's wife,<br> anything less would be monstrous.<br> But for a man like myself,<br> who did nothing...<br> What I wanted to ask:<br> if we lose the appeal,<br> will I have the chance later to set my<br> affairs in order before I'm incarcerated?<br> In Europe, a gentleman is given<br> the opportunity to end things properly.<br> - Come on, Claus.<br> - We are each the keeper of our own soul.<br> Two big problems:<br> the case against him is very strong,<br> and the legal conviction isn't the only<br> conviction that we've got to reverse.<br> The more dangerous conviction<br> is the absolute certainty<br> of the American people<br> that Claus is guilty.<br> Finding grounds for reversal<br> won't be enough here.<br> Judges on the Rhode Island<br> Supreme Court<br> will have to go home to their spouses<br> and explain why they reversed.<br> To get them to do that, we have to<br> obliterate every aspect of the state's case.<br> Destroy the medical case<br> and their witnesses,<br> so the judges have<br> no possible way to affirm.<br> Total victory,<br> or we are dead in the water.<br> Now, I assume that you've all had<br> an opportunity to look at the transcripts.<br> First impressions?<br> I think this whole thing stinks.<br> I think Claus von Bulow stinks.<br> He's obviously guilty of<br> something pretty despicable,<br> and, if we free him, we become partners<br> in his crime, accessories after the fact.<br> I'm shocked, with your record<br> defending the poor and oppressed,<br> that you've taken this case.<br> I won't have anything to do with it.<br> And I hope my fellow students<br> won't, either. Goodbye.<br> My I exercise my First Amendment<br> right to free speech?<br> If lawyers only defended the innocent,<br> there'd be just ten lawyers in the country.<br> Why help guilty people get off?<br> You're sure he's guilty? 100% sure?<br> He had a lawyer. He had a trial.<br> He was convicted.<br> - Are you sure he had a fair trial?<br> - Come on!<br> It's the basis of the whole legal system!<br> Everyone gets a defense.<br> So the system is there for the one<br> innocent person who was falsely accused.<br> OK, look. Say it's you. OK?<br> You decide to get a divorce.<br> You're gonna divorce your husband.<br> A week later, you're accused<br> of molesting your son.<br> Don't give me that look.<br> Stuff like this happens all the time.<br> Suddenly, you're alone. You hate it.<br> It's a nightmare.<br> Everyone assumes that you are guilty.<br> Even the mailman is beginning<br> to look at you a little funny.<br> You only got one person<br> who believes in you.<br> There's only one person<br> you can trust: your lawyer.<br> Yeah, OK. So, someone's<br> gotta defend Claus.<br> But why you? Why us?<br> Look, you're my student.<br> You have a choice.<br> You don't have to do anything<br> you don't want to. That is your choice.<br> The reason I take cases - and here<br> I'm unlike most other lawyers,<br> who are not professors<br> and have to make a living -<br> I take cases cos I get pissed off.<br> And I am pissed off here.<br> The family hired a private prosecutor.<br> Unacceptable!<br> They conducted a private search!<br> Now, we let 'em get away with that, rich<br> people won't go to the cops any more.<br> You know what they'll do? Get<br> their own lawyers to collect evidence.<br> And then they are going<br> to choose which evidence<br> they feel like passing on to the DA.<br> And the next victim isn't<br> gonna be rich like von Bulow,<br> but is gonna be some poor schnook who<br> can't afford or can't find a decent lawyer.<br> I think it's a little more complicated<br> than your simple moral superiority.<br> No?<br> I agree von Bulow is guilty, but that's<br> the fun. I mean, that's the challenge.<br> See? Now, there is a lawyer.<br> - What?<br> - I have Mr. von Bulow for you.<br> OK, put him on.<br> Alan, a rather unsavory character<br> called David Marriott contacted me,<br> claiming to have information about<br> a drug delivery at Clarendon Court.<br> - OK. Where does he live?<br> - Somewhere in Wakefield.<br> OK, we'll get on it.<br> Tom, I want you to get<br> a private investigator<br> to dig into a David Marriott,<br> lives in Wakefield.<br> - OK. How are we gonna win this case?<br> - The judge made lots of mistakes.<br> Judges always make mistakes.<br> How will we win?<br> One issue leaps up.<br> This lawyer, Brillhoffer,<br> interviewed Alex, Maria, everybody.<br> He was the first to hear their stories.<br> He took notes and used them at trial<br> against a defense witness.<br> But the defense never saw the notes.<br> The judge wouldn't let us have them.<br> It's perfect Brady.<br> OK, why don't you draft a letter,<br> writing to Brillhoffer,<br> asking him very nicely<br> to send us his notes?<br> - Yeah, right. He'll fax them right over.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> We could win on this issue alone.<br> You know it, I know it.<br> Just make sure he knows it.<br> - Now, Nancy and Dobbs.<br> - Yes?<br> They're going to attack<br> the medical testimony.<br> Our Rhode Island counsel,<br> Peter Macintosh,<br> he will analyze the state supreme court.<br> The rest of us should begin dissecting<br> the transcript. Errors, inconsistencies.<br> OK, great. Now remember, most cases<br> are won in the field, not in court.<br> Minnie?<br> You wanna work with Sarah on this?<br> - You may learn something.<br> - Come on, Minnie.<br> Minnie!<br> - Please?<br> - Come on.<br> I don't trust Marriott. I don't know him.<br> But if he knew Alex von Auersberg...<br> You're crazy. I don't know who<br> you think you are. Perry Mason?<br> Let our private investigator interview him.<br> It's stupid and unprofessional.<br> - It's fun.<br> - Fun? This guy is a sleaze.<br> - You don't know what he's gonna try.<br> - What, is he gonna shoot me?<br> Come on, I'm from Brooklyn.<br> OK, I'll stand by the window every ten<br> minutes. That way you can know I'm safe.<br> I had this friend, Gilbert Jackson.<br> Interior decorator.<br> Flaming queen,<br> but a very excellent guy.<br> He introduced me to Alex von Auersberg.<br> Sure it was Alex?<br> We had dinner a few times, drinks.<br> All I knew, Alex was some rich kid.<br> So sometimes - this is like summer of '77-<br> I'd motor to Newport for some R and R.<br> Gilbert asked me to bring Alex a package.<br> I figured interior decoration.<br> Maybe drapes.<br> Like six times. So I'd call Alex.<br> - How did you get his phone number?<br> - From Gilbert.<br> - You still have it?<br> - Maybe.<br> I'm that kind of guy.<br> Here.<br> One night, I got curious.<br> Opened the package.<br> Fuckin' pharmacy, man.<br> Needles, syringes, white powder,<br> nice selection of pills, Demerol...<br> Like a drugstore.<br> You delivered drugs six times<br> and didn't know it?<br> Stupid, huh?<br> Then Gilbert asked me again.<br> I couldn't say no, but this time I made<br> Alex open the package in front of me.<br> Voil.<br> I go "Awful lot of pharmaceuticals<br> for one person."<br> He goes "Oh, I give some<br> to my mom to keep her off my back."<br> A few weeks later,<br> Gilbert gets mistaken for a softball.<br> Two guys bash his head in.<br> Alex calls me, totally urinary.<br> Will the cops find his phone number<br> and fuck up his trust fund or something?<br> Well, that's the fat. That's the skinny.<br> You like it?<br> You traffic with drug dealers<br> and drag queens,<br> you have a part-time job,<br> you ride in rented limos.<br> All in all, I'd say you're probably the least<br> impressive witness I've ever seen.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You think I'm scum, don't you?<br> Blow it out your ass.<br> You want a witness to back me up?<br> I'll get one.<br> And hey, maybe I'll see you<br> at the Celtics, huh?<br> I am not going to let them execute you.<br> You're not gonna die.<br> Look, Johnny, this is gonna be<br> a lot easier on you if you don't cry, OK?<br> I... I know your brother's hysterical.<br> Number one, they always<br> set a date for the execution,<br> and they always postpone it.<br> He's great like this. I just wish he had<br> something left for those around him.<br> Why are you talking to me about money?<br> Anyway, it's nice to have you back here.<br> Say hello to your brother.<br> Right. OK.<br> OK, who's got what?<br> Maria's testimony. She says Sunny<br> did take Valium prescribed for Claus.<br> Score one for von Bulow.<br> - And this Jamie Smather prescription?<br> - Who's Jamie Smather?<br> boots. She supplied Claus with Valium.<br> He had a gorgeous mistress<br> and went to an ugly whore?<br> There are some things<br> even mistresses won't do.<br> - Like what?<br> - I am not telling.<br> Anyway, Maria swears she first saw<br> this Jamie Smather prescription<br> February 14th,<br> and then again February 28th.<br> - So?<br> - It wasn't prescribed till the 28th.<br> You're not suggesting she's lying?<br> How about Maria's insulin?<br> Anything more on that?<br> Not yet.<br> Something about that bothers me.<br> - OK, who's next?<br> - Brillhoffer wrote back.<br> He's very attached to his notes.<br> "I am satisfied that there is not<br> a scrap of paper in my files<br> that might even arguably<br> be viewed as exculpatory."<br> - Translation?<br> - He says he has nothing that'd help us.<br> - You with me?<br> - Pay dirt.<br> - What?<br> - He's a lawyer.<br> If he didn't have anything,<br> he'd give it to us.<br> But there's something there,<br> and he'll fight to hold on to it.<br> I will bet my fee that no one<br> remembered seeing insulin<br> until after the lab report came back.<br> - So you're suggesting...<br> - Memory enhancement.<br> - It might be more than that.<br> - Possibly.<br> - A frame-up.<br> - You mean, by the kids?<br> - Where d'you get this? Brillhoffer's letter?<br> - Pure deduction.<br> A good lawyer is part psychiatrist,<br> detective, logician.<br> - A great lawyer...<br> - Never would have taken this case.<br> If there's nothing more...<br> Has anybody read this?<br> It's an interview with Truman Capote.<br> He says, when she was 19, Sunny von<br> Bulow taught him how to inject drugs.<br> Let me see that.<br> - Well, well, well. The famous professor.<br> - My new girlfriend, Andrea Reynolds.<br> - I'm not his girlfriend. I'm his savior.<br> - Perfectly true.<br> Two days after the trial, we fell in love.<br> It was really very dramatic.<br> Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, come on.<br> Since then, I've devoted my life<br> to clearing his name.<br> I made him hire you.<br> "Get the Jew," I said.<br> Darling...<br> Can the Jew get down to business?<br> We've got an affidavit. Smythe.<br> Mrs. Ruth Smythe gave us an affidavit<br> corroborating Truman Capote.<br> I have affidavits, too.<br> Newport people.<br> They describe Sunny taking pills,<br> getting drunk and falling down,<br> thumping into doorways,<br> smearing lipstick all over her face.<br> - Not a very pretty picture.<br> - She did it, didn't she?<br> Don't be a priss.<br> - Sunny was a lovely woman.<br> - Spoiled rotten.<br> Yes, but lovely. Till she drank.<br> Two drinks, and she became...<br> nasty, irrational.<br> All women are irrational.<br> Did we mention the priest?<br> Oh. Marriott apparently confided<br> in a priest, who's consented to talk to us.<br> Father Capello from Providence.<br> A priest? A priest is the ideal witness.<br> It's like getting the word of God.<br> I checked. God is unavailable.<br> lf... if the priest comes through,<br> and we can get documentation<br> on Sunny's drug use,<br> self-injection may be a plausible theory.<br> - There's no insulin in this case.<br> - But people do use insulin.<br> They use it for dieting.<br> Sunny was concerned about her weight.<br> Maybe, but believe me, Alan,<br> there's no insulin here.<br> Really? How can you be so sure?<br> You realize, with this case,<br> I'm looking for evidence to exonerate you.<br> But, at the same time, I'm also<br> wondering... what really happened.<br> - Who you are.<br> - Who would you like me to be?<br> Your mother's death... What happened?<br> I believe she had a heart problem.<br> The rumor in England is you killed her.<br> Hey, Alan. Statute of limitations<br> ran out on that years ago.<br> There's rumors also that I killed my aunt.<br> And that I'm a necrophiliac<br> who injected Sunny with insulin<br> so that I could have my way with her.<br> Please.<br> Your Mother's death was not<br> recorded for five full days.<br> True.<br> - Where were you during that time ?<br> In the flat.<br> -Where the body was ?<br> My mother is my own business.<br> Did Claus drive me crazy?<br> Even I don't know.<br> But it's true that I took<br> up to 24 laxatives daily,<br> popped aspirin like M&M's,<br> smoked three packs of cigarettes a day,<br> had a problem with alcohol,<br> took Valium and Seconal frequently<br> and consumed large quantities of sweets,<br> despite a medical condition,<br> hypoglycemia,<br> which made them hazardous.<br> As for my state of mind...<br> I had not had sex with<br> my husband for years.<br> My schedule was: I woke at 9.30,<br> did a little exercise and shopping,<br> and returned to bed at 3 o'clock<br> for the remainder of the afternoon.<br> I liked to be in bed.<br> I didn't much like anything else.<br> Hold on here, will you?<br> - Come in.<br> - Alan.<br> Welcome to my humble law firm.<br> In the kitchen,<br> our insulin-on-the-needle team.<br> They're cooking up<br> some surprise for us.<br> This is our Brillhoffer-notes team.<br> Mr. von Bulow.<br> - Where are the paper towels?<br> - Ask Sarah!<br> Sarah used to live here.<br> This... I guess he was up all night.<br> This sort of commune,<br> you do it on every case?<br> Never before. 38 days to write<br> Here's the black-bag team.<br> Illegal-search team.<br> My son Elon lost his room. Actually<br> this is another case that you're paying for.<br> - And this is my team.<br> - You wish.<br> I can't find the damn thing.<br> - Hi. I'm Sarah.<br> - And a very lovely Sarah you are.<br> - Does that really work?<br> - Flattery? Absolutely.<br> Like Chinese food?<br> What do you give a wife<br> who has everything?<br> An injection of insulin.<br> How... Ah, my prawns.<br> How can one define a fear of insulin?<br> Claustrophobia.<br> Is there anything more you can<br> tell us about Alexandra Isles?<br> Is it true that she gave you a deadline<br> of Christmas 1979 to be together?<br> Not really. No, she knew<br> I was looking for full-time work.<br> I worked for JP Getty in London.<br> Alexandra assumed that, when you did<br> find a job, you'd marry her?<br> Oh, she assumed it.<br> Did you sense that she<br> wanted to get back together?<br> Very much so.<br> In fact, at the trial, she said...<br> I loved him, but I was still<br> caught up in my own anger.<br> And I'm sorry I acted that way then.<br> I loved him then. I was angry.<br> Let me ask you this.<br> Maybe you can't answer.<br> Do you still love him?<br> I don't know.<br> - That means yes.<br> - It would seem so.<br> In fact, after the trial, she wrote me<br> a letter saying so explicitly.<br> A very passionate letter.<br> Passionate and jealous.<br> But that was the relationship<br> from the outset. That was Alexandra.<br> She was your love slave.<br> Ah. I think now I'll have my own<br> individual order of ginger prawns.<br> Three weeks before her final coma,<br> Sunny overdosed on aspirin.<br> - Can you tell us about that?<br> - I had nothing to do with that.<br> Of course not.<br> I'm asking you what happened.<br> Sunny had been unwell.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Just a bit dizzy.<br> If you're dizzy, don't go wandering...<br> Sunny?<br> Oh, my God. Come on, my darling.<br> You're all right. Put your arm<br> around my shoulder.<br> No, you're all right. Come on,<br> we'll get you back into bed.<br> - Something happened to my head.<br> - You're all right.<br> It's just a little cut.<br> Come on, let's get you lying down.<br> There you are.<br> There.<br> - Shall I call a doctor?<br> - No!<br> No, I don't want a doctor.<br> Just... I don't want a doctor.<br> I just wanna be left alone.<br> I wanna be left alone<br> with all those beautiful letters.<br> What did you do with those letters?<br> Why did you write those letters?<br> Later the doctor said<br> we needn't have gone to hospital,<br> but I wasn't going to take any chances.<br> Why did she take so much aspirin?<br> Sunny always took aspirin. She'd<br> been taking a lot for several days.<br> - That's not what our doctor said.<br> - Dr. Lucus Lupardus,<br> chief forensic toxicologist,<br> Suffolk County,<br> says people who take lots of aspirin<br> every day never reach that level.<br> He also said the average blood level<br> in cases of death is 60. Hers was 90. So...<br> So, it was obviously a suicide attempt.<br> - Why?<br> - Yeah. Why?<br> - Why?<br> - Alan, do they all want to be prosecutors?<br> We're waiting.<br> I presume she was unhappy.<br> How about we all finish up<br> and go back to the house?<br> We're not gonna win this<br> on a technicality. Peter?<br> I've read every recent case where<br> the Rhode Island Supreme Court reversed.<br> They don't like to make new law<br> or discuss broad legal issues.<br> When they do reverse,<br> the grounds are technical,<br> but the reason seems to be<br> they suspect a convicted<br> defendant may be innocent.<br> OK, everybody get that?<br> True or not, we've gotta convince<br> the judges that you are innocent.<br> Claus, now I do wanna<br> hear your side of the story.<br> With pleasure. Innocence<br> has always been my position.<br> First coma: what preceded it?<br> Sunny loved Christmas.<br> It was her favorite season, really.<br> You see, what you must<br> understand about Sunny<br> is that she loved giving<br> more than anything else.<br> Each year, she always made<br> a big bowl of fresh eggnog.<br> On that year, she drank a lot of it.<br> - How much?<br> - 10 or 12 glasses.<br> - With her hypoglycemia?<br> - Did she always drink like that?<br> Never. She never touched alcohol at all,<br> except on social occasions<br> to overcome her shyness<br> or when she was upset.<br> This was not a social occasion?<br> No. We'd been discussing<br> divorce all afternoon.<br> This whole subject of<br> your work coming between us,<br> isn't it just a pretext,<br> when the real subject is her?<br> Certainly not.<br> I'm thinking of redecorating<br> this whole fucking house.<br> Then she knew about Alexandra.<br> - Yes.<br> - How did she find out?<br> Er... I...<br> I told her the previous summer.<br> Oh, I've been meaning to mention...<br> our understanding about my...<br> extracurricular activities.<br> Mm?<br> I've been involved with someone who falls<br> outside the parameters of our agreement.<br> - Really?<br> - Someone peripherally in our circle.<br> Billy Botsky's daughter, Alexandra Isles.<br> Well...<br> That must be better for you than<br> what you've had to put up with.<br> You're referring to the call girls.<br> Yes. I mean, that is where<br> you've gone previously, isn't it?<br> Yes, it is.<br> And isn't this better? Or is<br> Billy Botsky's daughter a call girl too?<br> This is much better.<br> That was what? July, August?<br> Now it's Christmastime, and you were<br> still squabbling over Alexandra?<br> No, we were fighting about my work.<br> Sunny was...<br> Well, by the evening,<br> she'd drunk so much eggnog<br> that I had to help her into the bedroom.<br> Time for bed, darling.<br> There we are.<br> Please don't hold my arm.<br> Darling, you know when you get like this.<br> Do you remember?<br> You fell and broke your hip.<br> That was years ago.<br> It was two years ago.<br> Get me a Scotch and soda.<br> May I at least urinate alone?<br> She runs the water every time<br> she goes in there.<br> If she was soused, why get the Scotch?<br> Because she asked for it.<br> Sunny got what Sunny wanted.<br> It's OK.<br> - Good night, Daddy.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> - Good night, Claus.<br> - Good night, Alex.<br> Hasn't my mother given us<br> enough money? Claus!<br> That night, we hardly slept.<br> Your age is perfectly acceptable to retire.<br> I'm already retired.<br> I haven't worked full-time since Getty.<br> Exactly. It's your ego.<br> You've never had a career, not really.<br> I'm going to have one now.<br> Come on, Sunny. Your father worked.<br> Do you want the children to think<br> a male's place is in a deck chair?<br> You marry me for my money,<br> then demand to work.<br> You're the prince of perversion!<br> - Are you trying to destroy our family?<br> - No, of course not. I simply want some...<br> ...intercourse with the world.<br> Shut up, Pan!<br> Oh, what does it matter?<br> So, is that it? Another divorce?<br> OK. I'll divorce you. I will.<br> Oh, God. Two-time loser.<br> - I'll divorce everybody.<br> - I don't want a divorce.<br> I don't want to marry<br> Billy Botsky's daughter.<br> I want to stay with you and I want<br> to work. I need that as a man.<br> It's hopeless.<br> Oh, God. I need my beauty sleep.<br> Why do you believe it's hopeless<br> just because it's some...<br> Good night, Claus.<br> Sunny, you know I love you.<br> Good night.<br> - OK, and the next day?<br> - Well...<br> Maria's testimony<br> was wildly exaggerated.<br> Sunny was never moaning.<br> Maybe the occasional slur, but...<br> And Maria shook Sunny.<br> Nobody ever shook Sunny.<br> What happened when<br> she became conscious?<br> After the first coma,<br> it was kind of absurd.<br> Everybody was angry at me.<br> Can't you ever leave me alone?<br> Why did you do it?<br> I would've been better off.<br> You would've been better off.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> I'm sorry I saved your life?<br> Yes.<br> Say it.<br> Of course I'm not sorry.<br> Claus.<br> What am I going to do with myself?<br> When I phoned Alexandra to tell her,<br> she said the same thing.<br> She said "Why did you do it?<br> Why did you call the doctor?"<br> Are you saying she wanted you<br> to let Sunny die?<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> It was more "Everybody says<br> Sunny's such an unhappy woman<br> and has nothing to live for."<br> Well, so much for the first coma.<br> The second, of course,<br> was much more theatrical.<br> Theatrical? What is this, a fucking game?<br> This is life and death.<br> Your wife is laying in a coma.<br> You don't even make<br> a pretence at caring, do you?<br> Of course I care, Alan.<br> It's just I don't wear<br> my heart on my sleeve.<br> Let's call it a night, OK?<br> As you wish.<br> Three drugs on the needle:<br> amobarbital, Valium, insulin.<br> We can't all be you, Alan.<br> Get a doctor to prepare five needles.<br> One with nothing, two with<br> Valium, amobarbital and insulin,<br> two with just Valium and amobarbital.<br> We send them to the lab<br> that our famous needle went to.<br> See if we get a false-positive result.<br> - If we don't?<br> - If we don't, I clean the latrines.<br> You're not gonna believe this.<br> David Marriott wants money.<br> Who doesn't?<br> - His memory might fail.<br> - Forget him.<br> He has lost his job, and he is running<br> around trying to find evidence for us.<br> Let's do what the government does<br> with witnesses. Pay him for his time.<br> - What's his time worth?<br> - Buck and a half.<br> Dersh! Your team's on!<br> - You gonna pass to me this game?<br> - No.<br> Their investigator said the needle<br> had an encrustation near the tip.<br> Doctors tell us this is<br> inconsistent with injection.<br> So how did it get there?<br> Oh.<br> If I inject this needle,<br> the skin acts as a kind of a swab.<br> It cleans the needle off, leaving<br> the tip completely free of liquid.<br> But if I just dip the needle<br> into the liquid, what do you see?<br> Dry this out, you have an encrustation.<br> So it's a frame-up?<br> It's Desdemona's handkerchief.<br> My stepchildren thought I was guilty,<br> didn't have evidence, so concocted some.<br> - This should win us the case, no?<br> - No. We're maybe halfway home.<br> There's still a lot of weird stuff.<br> - Did you love Sunny?<br> - I married her.<br> Of course I loved her. She was beautiful.<br> - Rich.<br> - Why not?<br> What I've seen of the rich,<br> you can have 'em.<br> I do.<br> The black bag. Was it yours?<br> Sunny appropriated it.<br> But to understand that, you must<br> understand that, after the first coma,<br> she went into a complete rage.<br> - Did you take them?<br> - Certainly not. Take what?<br> My pills, you moron!<br> Valium, Seconal.<br> - You took them, didn't you?<br> - I've long since stopped interfering.<br> Well, who? My children wouldn't dare.<br> - Oh. I know who.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Maria!<br> She soon found them.<br> It's my lovely mother, isn't it?<br> She's behind all this.<br> She's in cahoots with Maria.<br> Well, just because she had all the money<br> before I had all the money<br> does not mean she's my lord and master.<br> Of course not. I am your lord and master.<br> Just kidding.<br> Maria loves me too much.<br> It's unhealthy for her,<br> and it's certainly no fun for me.<br> There.<br> We'll see if that ugly little maid<br> of mine can sniff this one out.<br> And what are you going<br> to do with all that?<br> I'm not gonna tell you. I assure you,<br> it's not gonna be among my affairs.<br> Odd she used that word - "affairs".<br> The prosecution thinks you ground up<br> the drugs to inject Sunny.<br> And this nose-drop business<br> is pretty far-fetched.<br> But consider the pattern, Alan.<br> It's public record that Sunny used drugs.<br> Her behavior here of hiding them<br> in liquid so that no one will find them<br> is your classic alcoholic stashing<br> pints of whiskey all over the house.<br> You're right. Of course.<br> You've always been right, haven't you?<br> This is the most dangerous case<br> I ever worked on.<br> - You find that exhilarating?<br> - No, I do not. I am breaking every rule.<br> The best way to win<br> is to proclaim your innocence,<br> and I have never done that for anybody.<br> And the problem I got is<br> I see who you are.<br> - You'd do anything to win.<br> - So would you.<br> Yeah, but you don't trust the legal system.<br> You're saying I'd manufacture<br> witnesses, affidavits?<br> - No, but you would sacrifice me.<br> - Oh, please, Alan.<br> The more I believe that you are innocent,<br> then more nervous I am.<br> I go out on a limb for you, you're<br> proven guilty, I look like an asshole.<br> My reputation, my credibility,<br> my career - destroyed.<br> - That's the risk you're taking.<br> - Well, fuck you.<br> Fuck you, man!<br> I'm glad we understand one another.<br> It's easy to forget all this<br> is about me, lying here.<br> To most of you, my name means "coma".<br> My second marriage means<br> "attempted murder".<br> Everything before, everything beautiful,<br> does not exist in the public mind.<br> No one thinks of how I loved<br> my children. Look at Cosima.<br> And Alex, of course. And Ala.<br> And certainly no one cares about Claus,<br> the way he was when<br> I fell in love with him.<br> When Claus and I first met,<br> I was married to the dashing young<br> Prince Alfred Eduard Friederich<br> Vincenz Martin Maria von Auersberg.<br> It was 1964, seven years<br> into my first marriage.<br> It seems that my first husband,<br> Alfie, as he was called,<br> had vowed to be unfaithful<br> with every pretty girl in Europe.<br> He was having quite a success.<br> And so... I was unfaithful with Claus.<br> Psst.<br> Wildly unfaithful.<br> Happy memories.<br> But it's not the passion<br> I remember most.<br> It's the tenderness.<br> Good God, what's that?<br> Just one of Frank's pets.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Come on, silly.<br> I never liked people much, not as a rule.<br> But Claus was somehow different.<br> Not a normal person, I guess.<br> It's all right. Do it again.<br> Give him some more.<br> One of those things you never forget.<br> Of course, now he lives<br> in my apartment, my bedroom,<br> my bed.<br> Cold, isn't it? Cold and brutish,<br> and the way of the world.<br> Looking at him now,<br> the issue seems simple.<br> Is he the devil?<br> If so, can the devil get justice?<br> And all this legal activity...<br> is it in Satan's service?<br> "Sunny von Bulow was totally vulnerable<br> to Claus von Bulow"?<br> - Can't argue with that.<br> - But it's speculation, exaggeration.<br> - You keep working on it.<br> - Totally inflammatory!<br> OK, good. Let's go over this.<br> OK, we went over it once.<br> I just want you to see if it...<br> Oh, shit. What is this? Illegal search?<br> A technicality, a guilty man's argument.<br> This is different. Usual Fourth Amendment<br> case, you're trying to exclude evidence.<br> Same thing here.<br> No, this search destroyed evidence!<br> No fingerprints, no inventory.<br> What's left hurts Claus,<br> but the state has to...<br> The cops tested the drugs<br> from the illegal search.<br> - Yes.<br> - And we are saying that that test<br> constituted a second illegal search.<br> - There are precedents.<br> - I know there are. I'm not debating that.<br> - What I'm trying to do...<br> - You're debating me, personally. Why?<br> I'm debating strategy.<br> I'm not debating you.<br> We're all on the same team, aren't we?<br> I don't know. We seem to be.<br> - Then why don't I feel it?<br> - I thought this was professional.<br> - It was.<br> - That's bullshit, Alan!<br> I asked you to work on this case<br> because I think you are a good lawyer.<br> You too, but you give all you have to the<br> law and forget the people you care about.<br> My clients are the people<br> that I care about.<br> - Obviously.<br> - What I care about,<br> all I fuckin' care about is this!<br> This case!<br> And making the best possible appeal<br> that we're capable of doing, OK?<br> You can make your argument better.<br> You know that! I know that!<br> So why don't you just do it<br> and cut all the bullshit?<br> You always have to have<br> the last word, don't you?<br> What?<br> We're gonna lose.<br> Why do you think this case<br> fascinates people?<br> Cos one time or other, every man is<br> driven crazy by his wife, and in his heart,<br> he wants to do exactly<br> what Claus is accused of.<br> Kill her in some sly, silent way<br> that can't be detected.<br> Claus is a scapegoat.<br> Someone has to suffer for the sin<br> that we all wanna commit.<br> Alan, that's ridiculous.<br> It's ridiculous. You're right.<br> - What have you got?<br> - Prosecution's case is based on a theory.<br> The needle in the bag, insulin<br> on the needle, insulin in her blood.<br> Right, right, right. OK, fine.<br> In Derek, this Rhode Island<br> Supreme Court, these same judges,<br> said that, in a case<br> based on circumstantial theory,<br> the case falls apart<br> if any part of the theory is weak.<br> If there's a weak link,<br> then you throw the whole chain out?<br> Exactly.<br> Peter, that's good. That's very good.<br> - Oh, yeah, this is good.<br> - Thank you.<br> What do you want me to do now?<br> I want you to find as many<br> alternative theories as possible.<br> Hey! Come on.<br> There's only seven days left.<br> Dersh! You'd better come downstairs.<br> Hey, Dersh. Sorry to get you out of bed.<br> - What do you want? More money?<br> - Can you get more?<br> Can I have a glass of water, please?<br> No. The reason I'm here...<br> my affidavit is inaccurate.<br> Great. Just what I need right now.<br> - It's slow.<br> - Yeah.<br> I left something out,<br> something incredibly important.<br> Remember I gave Alex's drugs<br> to a woman at Clarendon Court?<br> Yeah. So?<br> That bitch was definitely<br> Sunny von Bulow.<br> David... this is bad.<br> It looks bad. I've met with you<br> five times now, and all of a sudden...<br> No, it's not sudden.<br> I think I always knew, but I became<br> convinced by staring at pictures of her.<br> We can't use your affidavit unless<br> it's truthful. Are you sure this time?<br> I swear... on the body<br> and soul of my mother.<br> Poor woman.<br> Put in this change, and make him<br> go over every word of the affidavit.<br> Uh... can I use your men's room?<br> - More money?<br> - Can you get more?<br> If Claus had injected her, he would've<br> thrown away the needle, right?<br> Sure. If he threw away the insulin,<br> why keep the needle?<br> - Claus is strange, but he ain't stupid.<br> - He is arrogant.<br> - Is that a crime?<br> - Sometimes.<br> Why are we even discussing this?<br> It's obvious: the kids framed him.<br> Whoa! You changed your tune.<br> A frame-up doesn't mean he's innocent.<br> The kids could've framed the guilty man.<br> Dersh! Telephone!<br> It's Peter Macintosh.<br> Yeah.<br> Do you know what it is?<br> OK.<br> Word in Rhode Island is that the state<br> can't lose. Got an ace up their sleeve.<br> What is it?<br> He's gonna try to find out.<br> - All right, my friend.<br> - Friend? I like that.<br> Nothing personal.<br> OK, no students, no witnesses.<br> Second coma: let's hear it.<br> Strange as it may seem now,<br> in retrospect...<br> OK, Claus, cut the bullshit.<br> December 20, 1980.<br> Sunny was unwell.<br> We'd been arguing all afternoon.<br> I'd been offered a new position<br> in the oil business,<br> which would've meant<br> my spending some time in Europe.<br> The discussion must've escalated<br> because I went to talk to the children.<br> This will bring 50,000 gold florin<br> from any rebels worth the name.<br> - 50,000 florin?<br> - That's a pretty good take.<br> - Let's vote on it! All those in favor...<br> - If you'll forgive my interruption...<br> I... I've something to tell you both.<br> We're heading for<br> the best pirate days ever.<br> I...<br> It looks as if... as though Mummy<br> and I are going to have to split up,<br> because my work is something<br> she cannot tolerate.<br> Mummy says things like that,<br> but she always gets over it.<br> Yes, but this has been<br> going on for too long.<br> I'm going to Europe in the new year.<br> This will probably lead to a split.<br> Oh.<br> It's all right. She'll get over it.<br> Alex says you said that the next day.<br> Is anything more absurd than announcing<br> your intention to divorce a woman<br> who's just fallen into a coma?<br> No. That evening everything<br> seemed normal enough.<br> Not cheerful. But then, we didn't<br> usually giggle at mealtimes.<br> Despite her doctor's warnings<br> about sweets,<br> the only thing Sunny consumed<br> was a sundae.<br> After supper, I went to finish off<br> some work in my study.<br> The others decided to<br> chat in the living room.<br> That would be lovely, but first<br> I need to go to my room for just a minute.<br> After about an hour, I dropped in on them.<br> Darling, would you care for anything?<br> Mm...<br> lf... there's some...<br> chicken bouillon left.<br> I'll look.<br> There you are, darling.<br> Thank you.<br> How is your work coming?<br> I'm totally flummoxed. I can't<br> get the figures to make any sense.<br> - Why don't you call your friend Deborah?<br> - I doubt she'd be in Saturday night.<br> So, Deborah, I think you'll agree<br> that's 7-2-8. Right. Now...<br> But Deborah was home,<br> and we did talk for some time, until...<br> Claus, come quick. Mummy's not well.<br> Deborah, can I call you back<br> in the morning? Thanks.<br> Her voice got very weak, and she<br> almost fell down. I had to help her.<br> Somebody open a window.<br> I find the chill reassuring.<br> Now I must speak with Claus.<br> - Good night, Mummy.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night, darling.<br> Good night, Alex.<br> That is, if Claus has time to talk.<br> Or are you going to work every spare<br> moment right through Christmas?<br> Is your work so fascinating?<br> Or are you trying to drive me away?<br> Because if you are, you're succeeding,<br> because I don't want this.<br> I didn't marry you for this.<br> I could've had anybody.<br> With my money? Anybody!<br> Well? Say something!<br> Do something! Be a man!<br> I already have a butler.<br> Do something! I don't want this!<br> I don't! I don't want this!<br> I don't... I don't want this!<br> The same conversation as the previous<br> year, only this time with greater venom.<br> You've always been afraid of me.<br> It's not because of my money.<br> It's basically because you're a coward.<br> Your pitiful masculinity is so fragile,<br> you can't stand confrontation,<br> so you go off with Miss Botsky.<br> Good night.<br> As was usual,<br> I was awakened before dawn.<br> I let the dogs out, as was customary.<br> I went back through the bedroom<br> to my study as quietly as possible.<br> I did not notice if my wife was in bed.<br> I did not notice if the light was on<br> under the bathroom door.<br> Had it been on, I wouldn't<br> have given it a thought.<br> I did my exercises, showered,<br> and then I called Deborah Knowles.<br> Well, I mean, it's stable and it's profitable.<br> Can anyone really believe,<br> if I was trying to murder my wife,<br> that I would spend an hour<br> going over a tedious set of figures?<br> After the call, I passed through<br> the bedroom again. It was freezing.<br> By this time, Sunny<br> was certainly not in bed.<br> And I heard water<br> running in the bathroom.<br> I had breakfast, walked the dogs,<br> and, on my return,<br> asked the children where Mummy was.<br> Has Mummy had breakfast yet?<br> We haven't seen her.<br> Sunny?<br> Her bathroom was<br> her private sanctuary.<br> No one entered it. Except the maid,<br> of course, to clean up.<br> Sometimes she stayed there<br> for hours, or so it seemed.<br> One can only speculate<br> what goes on behind a closed door.<br> Sunny, are you there?<br> I hesitated even to knock.<br> Darling?<br> Sunny?<br> Oh, God.<br> Once I'd ascertained she was breathing,<br> I went to fetch Alexander.<br> - Why not call an ambulance first?<br> - Panic, Alan, panic.<br> I mean, I...<br> I needed to talk to somebody.<br> I wasn't worried if she was breathing<br> normally. It wasn't like the year before.<br> In retrospect it seems absurd,<br> but I looked at her upper lip.<br> She had blood on it. I thought she'd<br> broken a tooth. That was my concern.<br> And that's really all I can...<br> that's really all I can say.<br> - But is it the truth?<br> - Of course.<br> - But not the whole truth.<br> - I don't know the whole truth.<br> - I don't know what happened to her.<br> - I wish I didn't believe you.<br> It's very hard to trust someone<br> you don't understand.<br> You're a very strange man.<br> You have no idea.<br> - Everybody here?<br> - Macintosh says he's got bad news.<br> There he is.<br> Well?<br> I found out what the state has.<br> Their ace in the hole.<br> It's you.<br> It's me?<br> David Marriott taped<br> all his conversations with you.<br> Oh, great.<br> The scuttlebutt is,<br> if we win the case, you go to prison.<br> What did I say?<br> Good old corrupt Rhode Island.<br> A friend got me an excerpt.<br> The reason I'm here...<br> My affidavit is inaccurate.<br> David, this is bad. It looks bad.<br> What do you want? More money?<br> Can you get more?<br> Yeah.<br> - That is not what I said.<br> - It's on tape, Alan.<br> I don't care. That's not what I said.<br> - What do we do?<br> - I don't know.<br> I'll tell you what we do. We ignore it.<br> Alan, with that tape,<br> it's your whole career.<br> I now believe Claus is innocent,<br> so we've decided:<br> no tricks, no technicalities.<br> We are going to base our appeal directly<br> and explicitly on Claus's innocence.<br> - Appeals must be based on judicial error.<br> - The judge should've thrown out the case.<br> You can't say there wasn't<br> sufficient evidence. He was convicted.<br> - Good point.<br> - That's what we are saying.<br> If the rules don't work, you change them.<br> Red Auerbach changed the jump-ball rule<br> when the Celtics had a short team.<br> But it's dangerous politically.<br> If the judges feel insulted...<br> Wait. State supreme court shouldn't even<br> look at an appeal based on new evidence.<br> Hey, guys. I'll take care of that, OK?<br> You just leave it to me.<br> Look, I know you're all exhausted.<br> We got four days left.<br> What we do now will decide this thing.<br> Do you wanna win or not?<br> - Alan! We've got something.<br> - We've hit the jackpot.<br> Our needles that had<br> amobarbital and Valium...<br> But no insulin.<br> Both came back with<br> false-positive readings for insulin.<br> One was 93, the other 282.<br> We've knocked out every piece<br> of their medical case.<br> OK, now all they've got left is my neck.<br> Anybody know anything<br> about editing audio tapes?<br> Defense! Defense! Come on.<br> Come on, baby! Come on, baby!<br> - All right, Alan.<br> - Come on!<br> Pass it, Alan.<br> Wait a minute. I got it. Where's Raj?<br> - He's upstairs.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Raj. Raj, I got it.<br> I got it. Remember Maria?<br> She could have said it like this:<br> Insulin? For what, insulin?<br> My lady is not diabetic.<br> You see? "My lady is not diabetic."<br> She is assuming that the bag is Sunny's.<br> Her first reaction, not part of<br> a legal strategy devised later,<br> is that the stuff in the black bag<br> belonged to Sunny, not Claus.<br> Who'd know better than she?<br> Start writing.<br> You are not God! You are a prosecutor!<br> Alabama can't execute those Johnson<br> kids before the Supreme Court rules!<br> You heard me right.<br> - You got two hours to make Rhode Island.<br> - You want me to speed?<br> No. They'll stop you<br> and you won't make the deadline.<br> I'm telling you right now,<br> those kids fry, you're next!<br> You're damn right!<br> Some startling developments<br> in the von Bulow case.<br> Professor Alan Dershowitz had been<br> accused of paying for falsified testimony,<br> but those accusations were discredited<br> today by the attorney general,<br> who announced that<br> David Marriott's tape was doctored<br> and that Marriott is not a reliable witness.<br> So, what was he up to, Alan?<br> Who was he working for?<br> Damned if I know.<br> Hope they don't think he worked for you.<br> - No one's going to...<br> - Look, I don't think you did it, OK?<br> But at the Chinese restaurant,<br> you did duck the big question.<br> Chuck is our Alexandra Isles expert.<br> Sunny's aspirin overdose.<br> Why did she take so many?<br> What happened? Sunny had a headache?<br> The headache was Alexandra, right?<br> Let's hear it, Claus.<br> Alexandra was spiteful.<br> On the day of Sunny's aspirin overdose,<br> she returned some presents<br> I'd given her, some photographs.<br> Love letters.<br> She dropped them off in a shopping bag.<br> Did Sunny see them?<br> Sunny was home. I was not.<br> Alexandra neglected<br> to address the package to me.<br> I wanna be left alone with<br> all those beautiful letters.<br> What did you do with those letters?<br> Why did you write those letters?<br> There's a big difference<br> between knowing about an affair<br> and having love letters<br> crammed down your throat.<br> It seems that Sunny did care<br> about your affair. She cared a lot.<br> Why didn't you tell us?<br> Everything was open-book.<br> "Get the best experts."<br> "I'm not afraid of the truth."<br> Looks to me like Alexandra<br> tried to force Sunny into suicide.<br> Or they plotted it together.<br> Either way, he's protecting Alexandra<br> because he still loves her.<br> And why not? Hey, she's a babe.<br> Of course I still love her.<br> And hate her.<br> Alexandra, Sunny, Andrea...<br> I love them all.<br> Being a human being<br> is very literal.<br> You're trapped. Time moves<br> in only one direction: forward.<br> It's stupid and boring<br> and results in a lot of silliness.<br> Example: the legal process.<br> In this particular case, a vast amount<br> of time, effort and money was spent<br> trying to determine what happened on<br> those two nights so close to Christmas,<br> December 26, 1979, December 20, 1980.<br> Happened right here.<br> Even now, it all looks the same,<br> feels the same, smells the same.<br> If you could just go back in time<br> and take a peek, you'd know.<br> And all this would be unnecessary.<br> All rise!<br> Hear ye, hear ye. All persons having<br> business before the Supreme Court<br> holding in province within and for the<br> State of Rhode Island may now draw near.<br> Then again, everyone enjoys a circus.<br> Be seated.<br> If the appellant is ready,<br> you may proceed.<br> Oral argument will be made<br> by out-of-state counsel,<br> Professor Alan Dershowitz.<br> Your Honors, you may not<br> like Claus von Bulow.<br> You may think he is guilty of something.<br> But I am here to tell you he is innocent.<br> - Our new evidence...<br> - Professor.<br> You know there is no case which allows<br> you to introduce new evidence on appeal.<br> There is one, Your Honor.<br> And you wrote it: Derek.<br> In Derek, you yourself said<br> that a case based on<br> circumstantial theory rather than fact<br> only stands up if no other theory<br> makes sense.<br> The only way to show a better theory<br> is to present it.<br> Get on with it, counselor.<br> The first issue is the encrusted needle.<br> I hope you will have the courage<br> to free an innocent man<br> and remedy a grave injustice.<br> This will never work.<br> Too smart for his own good.<br> Alan says it will work.<br> If the prosecutor takes the bait.<br> What do you mean, "bait"?<br> Argues the evidence.<br> Your Honors, introduction<br> of new evidence on appeal<br> violates every principle of<br> jurisprudence, every statute,<br> every precedent, every rule of ethics.<br> He's nailing us.<br> I am not going to stand before you<br> and argue Mr. von Bulow's guilt.<br> However, I have no choice but to address<br> Mr. Dershowitz's arguments one by one.<br> - Bingo.<br> - First, the encrusted needle.<br> So, now it's up to the judges.<br> Tell me what you really think.<br> I think it's easier to love somebody<br> than to live with them.<br> Love is fantasy. Living is work.<br> I'll say. And those people<br> don't like to work.<br> But if you don't do the work, the love dies,<br> and nobody wants to deal with that one.<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br> The love died, Sunny couldn't accept it...<br> so Claus tried to kill her?<br> - Maybe.<br> - I don't agree.<br> Face it. All we had to do was<br> prove the state made a lousy case.<br> We didn't prove Claus was innocent.<br> We couldn't, and he probably isn't.<br> - You mean you think?<br> - So he didn't inject Sunny with insulin.<br> So what? First coma, no problem.<br> The attending doctor thought it was<br> caused by hypoglycemia. All right.<br> But what about the second coma?<br> I mean, why does Claus act so guilty?<br> Wouldn't any man feel guilty<br> if his wife was suicidal?<br> Yeah. So maybe she took the sleeping<br> pills with the intention of killing herself.<br> But how did she end up<br> lying on a marble floor<br> in a freezing bathroom<br> with her head under the toilet?<br> How about this?<br> Sunny wakes up miserable.<br> Second marriage is over,<br> children are leaving home.<br> What's to live for?<br> But when she was found, her nightgown<br> was hiked over her waist.<br> Exactly. How did it get there?<br> OK, let's say she's standing<br> at the sink. She has to pee.<br> At exactly the same instant,<br> the drugs hit,<br> her body convulses,<br> she grabs the nightgown.<br> - I don't buy that.<br> - It does seem far-fetched.<br> - So is the truth sometimes.<br> - Bull!<br> I think she took the drugs the previous<br> night. Maybe he saw her take them.<br> Or she told him she was going to<br> before they fell asleep.<br> This time, he wants her to succeed.<br> Sunny?<br> Maybe there's some way<br> he can help her along.<br> Of course. The open window.<br> Zero degrees.<br> But somebody might see her there.<br> The action of dragging her would<br> naturally pull up the nightgown.<br> In this cold, how long<br> could she survive?<br> Remember what Sunny said?<br> "I would've been better off.<br> You would've been better off. "<br> ...because the law is a blunt instrument.<br> It is not a rapier. It is a cudgel.<br> Tomorrow, death penalty. Which<br> reminds me of the comedian who said<br> "Why do they call it the death penalty?<br> It's no penalty. You're out of the game!"<br> - Good news.<br> - And more good news.<br> - The decision came?<br> - They just announced it.<br> - Five-zip.<br> - We murdered 'em.<br> - Grounds?<br> - They got the Brillhoffer notes.<br> And that guilty-man's argument,<br> search and seizure.<br> - Federal or state?<br> - Both.<br> If it's federal, they could appeal, but<br> as it's Rhode Island, they can't. We win.<br> Don't get too excited till<br> we see Brillhoffer's notes.<br> We destroyed their medical case, but their<br> witnesses still carry emotional weight.<br> Unless the Brillhoffer notes show<br> that they've changed their stories.<br> Good afternoon, sir.<br> - Let me get that for you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You have Brillhoffer's notes?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well?<br> - They're not what we hoped.<br> I knew it.<br> They're much better.<br> No one mentioned insulin<br> when they first talked to Brillhoffer.<br> Plus, Maria told him that, when<br> she supposedly first saw insulin,<br> she couldn't even read any of the<br> labels. They were all scraped off.<br> - What does this mean?<br> - It means...<br> that if there is a second trial,<br> we can be confident.<br> Both the medical case and<br> their witnesses are now highly suspect.<br> Ah!<br> Darling, this is Alan Dershowitz.<br> Yes, I know. Hello.<br> Alan tells me...<br> Well, things look very hopeful.<br> I knew it would come out all right.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, Alan, thank you.<br> I am eternally grateful.<br> Hey, this means we'll be getting back<br> your bail. A million dollars.<br> I know I still owe you, Alan.<br> Please send me your bill.<br> And maybe when you're in New York<br> we can meet for lunch. I'd enjoy that.<br> One thing, Claus. Legally,<br> this was an important victory.<br> Morally, you're on your own.<br> Claus von Bulow was given a<br> second trial and acquitted on both counts.<br> This is all you can know,<br> all you can be told.<br> When you get where I am,<br> you will know the rest.<br> Claus von Bulow is still<br> married to Sunny von Bulow.<br> He is presently living<br> and working in London.<br> The Johnson brothers<br> remain on death row.<br> Sunny von Bulow has not spoken<br> since she fell into her final coma.<br> This film is based upon Alan Dershowitz's<br> book Reversal Of Fortune<br> and public records.<br> Dialogue and certain events<br> and characters contained in the film<br> were created for<br> the purpose of dramatization.<br> Two packs of Vantage, please.<br> - Anything else?<br> - Yes, a vial of insulin.<br> Just kidding.<br>
