Weve bought into<br> the same ridiculous delusion.<br> This idea that you have to<br> resign from life<br> and settle down<br> the moment you have children.<br> And weve been punishing<br> each other for it.<br> Listen,<br> we decided to move out here.<br> No one ever forced me to<br> take the job at Knox.<br> I mean who ever said I was supposed<br> to be a big deal, anyway?<br> When I first met you...<br> there was nothing in the world<br> you couldnt do or be.<br> When you first met me, I was a little<br> wise guy with a big mouth.<br> - That's all.<br> - You were not.<br> How can you even say that?<br> Okay.<br> Okay, so...<br> I'll have time.<br> And God knows thats appealing.<br> It's...<br> Its very appealing.<br> Everything you say make sense if...<br> If I had definite talent.<br> If I were a writer or an artist...<br> Listen.<br> Listen to me.<br> Its what you are thats being stifled.<br> Its what you are thats<br> being denied and denied,<br> in this kind of life.<br> And whats that?<br> Dont you know...?<br> Youre the most beautiful<br> and wonderful thing in the world...<br> Youre a man.<br> This is our chance, Frank<br> This is our one chance.<br> Okay.<br> Okay?<br> Why not?<br> Why the hell not?<br> All right.<br> All right. All right.<br> We're going to be fine.<br> Morning all.<br> Morning, Frank.<br> Ah, Franklin.<br> Good to see your shining face.<br> What's the news.<br> Fellas...<br> Im moving to Paris.<br> Indeed.<br> And Im moving to Tangiers.<br> xxx<br> xxx<br> xxx<br> xxx<br> ...Intra-company letter to Toledo...<br> Attention...<br> B.F.

At least for a while.<br> It is possible that Parisians<br> arent the only ones capable<br> with leading interesting lives, April.<br> So, youve made up your mind?<br> No.<br> No.<br> Like I said, its just an option.<br> That's all.<br> ...And supposing youre right.<br> You make all this money and we have this<br> interesting life here.<br> Wont you still be wasting your life<br> toiling away at a job<br> you find ridiculous?<br> Maybe we let that be my business.<br> All right?<br> Your buisness?<br> I can not...<br> Its too hot for this.<br> I'm gonna go get wet.<br> You dont wanna go, do you?<br> Come on, April.<br> Of course I do.<br> No!<br> You don't!<br> Because youve never<br> tried at anything.<br> And if you dont try at anything<br> you cant fail.<br> What the hell do you mean I dont try?<br> I support you, dont I?<br> I pay for this house.<br> I work ten hours a day<br> at a job I cant stand.<br> You dont have to!<br> Shit!<br> Look, Im not happy about it.<br> But I have the backbone not to run<br> away from my responsibilities!<br> It takes backbone to lead<br> the life you want, Frank.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - If it's alright with you, April...<br> I'm gonna go use the bathroom.<br> Okay?<br> What the hell you're gonna do with this?<br> And what do you think<br> youre gonna do?<br> - You're gonna stop me?<br> - Youre damn right! I am.<br> Go ahead and try!<br> Listen to me.<br> You do this, April.<br> You do this and I swear to God I'll...<br> Youll what?<br> You leave me?<br> Is that a threat, or a promise?<br> When did you buy this, April?<br> How long have you this? I wanna know!<br> Jeses Christ! You really are being<br> melodramatic about this whole thing.<br> As long as its done in the first<br> twelve weeks, its perfectly safe.<br> Thats now April!<br> Dont I get a say?<br> Of course you do!<br> It would be for you, Frank,<br> dont you see?<br> So you can have time.<br> Just like we talked about.<br> How can it be for me if the thought makes<br> my stomach turn over? For God's sake.<br> Then its for me...<br> Tell me we can have<br> the baby in Paris, Frank.<br> Tell me we can have different life,<br> but dont make me stay here. Please.<br> We cant have the baby in Paris.<br> Why not?<br> I dont need everything we have here.<br> I dont care where we live!<br> I mean,<br> who made these rules, anyway?<br> Look,<br> the only reason we moved out here<br> was because I got pregnant.<br> Then we had another child to prove<br> the first one wasnt a mistake.<br> I mean, how long does it go on?<br> Frank?<br> Do you actually want another child?<br> Well, do you?<br> Come on.<br> Tell me.<br> Tell me the truth, Frank.<br> Remember that?<br> We used to live by it.<br> And you know whats so good<br> about the truth?<br> Everyone knows what it is,<br> however long theyve lived without it.<br> No one forgets the truth, Frank,<br> they just get better at lying.<br> So tell me:<br> do you really want another child?<br> All I know is what I feel.<br> And anyone else in their right mind<br> would feel the same way, April.<br> But Ive had two children.<br> Doesnt that count in my favor?<br> Christ! The fact that<br> you even put it that way!<br> You make it seemed as having children is<br> some sort of goddamn punishment.<br> I love my children, Frank.<br> And youre sure about that?<br> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br> April,<br> you just said our daughter was mistake.<br> How do I know you didnt try to get<br> rid of her or Michael for that matter?<br> No.<br> How do I know you didnt try to flush our<br> entire fucking family down the toilet?<br> No. That's not true!<br> Of course I didnt.<br> But how do I know April?<br> Please stop.<br> Please just stop, Frank.<br> April,<br> a normal woman, a normal sane mother<br> doesnt buy a piece of rubber tubing<br> to give herself an abortion<br> so she can live out<br> some kind of God damn fantasy.<br> Look,<br> all Im saying is you dont seem<br> entirely rational about this thing...<br> And I think it's about time<br> we found somebody<br> to help make some sense of your life.<br> ...And the new jobs gonna pay<br> for that too?<br> April,<br> if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for.<br> Obviously.<br> Okay.<br> I guess there isnt much more to say,<br> then, is there?<br> So I guess Paris was<br> a pretty childish idea, huh?<br> I guess maybe it was.<br> April,<br> we can be happy here...<br> I can make you happy here.<br> Weve had a great couple of months.<br> It doesnt need to end...<br> Were gonna be okay.<br> I promise.<br> I hope so Frank.<br> I really hope so.<br> Thank you for waiting.<br> Mr. Pollock can see you now.<br> Thanks for watch.<br> Foiled by faulty contraception.<br> I cant say that Im sorry.<br> Youd have been sorely missed in<br> the old cubicle,<br> I can tell you that.<br> Wouldnt have been the same without you.<br> Besides which...<br> Well...<br> What?<br> The plan always seemed<br> the touch unrealistic,<br> dont you think?<br> I suppose, its none of my<br> business, really.<br> No, no.<br> I suppose it isn't.<br> Well...<br> Theyll be celebrating<br> in the secretarial pool.<br> Hey!
