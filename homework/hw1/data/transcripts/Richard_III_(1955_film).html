Elizabeth is Queen, Clarence, it's she.<br> - Oh.<br> We're not safe, brother.<br> We are not safe.<br> I beseech Your Lordships<br> both to pardon me.<br> His Majesty has strictly given me charge<br> that no man shall have private conference,<br> of what degree soever, with your brother.<br> We speak no treason, Brackenbury.<br> We say the King is wise and virtuous<br> and his Queen...<br> Well-struck in years.<br> I beseech you both to pardon me.<br> We know your charge, Brackenbury,<br> and we'll obey.<br> We are the Queen's subjects and must obey.<br> Brother, farewell.<br> I will unto the King.<br> Meanwhile, this deep<br> disgrace in brotherhood<br> touches me deeper than you can imagine.<br> Well, I know it pleases neither of us well.<br> Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.<br> I will deliver you or else lie for you.<br> Meanwhile, have patience.<br> Well, I must perforce.<br> - Farewell.<br> - Mmm.<br> Simple, plain Clarence.<br> I do love you so that I shall<br> shortly send your soul to heaven,<br> if heaven will take the present<br> from my hands.<br> And now, I'll marry.<br> What though I killed her husband<br> and his father.<br> Oh, cursed be the hand<br> that made these holes.<br> Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it.<br> Cursed the blood<br> that let this blood from hence.<br> If ever he have child, abortive be it.<br> If ever he have wife,<br> let her be made more miserable<br> by the life of him<br> than I am made<br> by my young husband's death.<br> What black magician conjures up this fiend<br> to stop devoted charitable deeds?<br> Sweet saint, for charity be not so cursed.<br> Foul devil,<br> for God's sake, hence and trouble me not,<br> for you have made this happy earth my hell!<br> If you delight to see your heinous deed,<br> behold the pattern of your butchery.<br> Lady,<br> you know no rules of charity.<br> Villain, you know no law of God nor man.<br> Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,<br> of this supposed crime to give me leave,<br> by circumstance, but to acquit myself.<br> Did you not kill my husband?<br> I grant you, yes.<br> You grant me, hedgehog?<br> Then God grant me, too,<br> you may be damned for that wicked deed.<br> Gentle Lady Anne...<br> Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.<br> The fitter for the King of heaven<br> who has him.<br> And you unfit for anyplace but hell.<br> Yes, one place else,<br> if you will hear me name it.<br> Some dungeon.<br> Your bedchamber.<br> Let's leave this keen encounter of our wits.<br> Your beauty,<br> which did haunt me in my sleep,<br> could make me undertake<br> the death of all the world,<br> so I might live one hour<br> in your sweet bosom.<br> If I thought that, I tell you, homicide,<br> I would rend that beauty from my cheeks.<br> These eyes could not endure<br> that beauty's wreck.<br> As all the world is cheered by the sun,<br> so I by that, it is my day,<br> my life.<br> He who bereft you, Lady, of your husband,<br> did it to help you to a better husband.<br> His better does not breathe upon the earth.<br> He lives who loves you better than he could.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Here.<br> Why do you spit at me?<br> Would it were mortal poison, for your sake.<br> Never came poison from so sweet a place.<br> Never hung poison on a fouler toad.<br> Out of my sight!<br> You do infect my eyes!<br> Those eyes of yours<br> from mine have drawn salted tears.<br> Yet when I heard the story<br> of my father's death<br> and all the standers-by had wet<br> their cheeks like trees bedashed with rain,<br> in that sad time,<br> my manly eyes did scorn a humble tear,<br> and what that sorrow<br> could not thence exhale,<br> your beauty has.<br> And made them blind with weeping.<br> Teach not your lip such scorn,<br> for it was made for kissing, Lady,<br> and not for such contempt.<br> If your revengeful heart cannot forgive,<br> I humbly beg for death<br> upon my knee.<br> Now, do not pause.<br> It was I who killed your husband,<br> but it was your heavenly face<br> which set me on.<br> Take up the blade again,<br> or take up me.<br> I will not be your executioner.<br> Then, bid me kill myself, and I will do it.<br> I have already.<br> That was in your rage. Speak it again.<br> I would I knew your heart, I fear it is false.<br> Then never was man true.<br> Put down the blade.<br> But shall I live in hope?<br> All men I hope live so.<br> Vouchsafe to wear this ring.<br> To take is not to give.<br> May I, with all expedient duty, see you?<br> And much it joys me, too,<br> to see you are become so penitent.<br> Bid me farewell.<br> It is more than you deserve,<br> but since you teach me how to flatter you,<br> imagine I have said farewell already.<br> Was ever a woman in this humor wooed?<br> Was ever a woman in this humor won?<br> I'll have her,<br> but I'll not keep her long. Eh?<br> I, who killed her husband and his father,<br> to take her in her heart's extremest hate,<br> with curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,<br> and then to win her.<br> All the world to nothing! Ha!<br> Upon my life she finds, although I cannot,<br> myself to be a marvelous, proper man.<br> I'll entertain a score or two of tailors<br> to study fashions to adorn my body.<br> And then return lamenting to my love.<br> Shine out, fair sun, till I've bought a glass<br> that I may see my shadow as I pass!<br> Catesby.<br> Clarence still breathes.<br> Edward still lives and reigns.<br> When they are gone,<br> then shall I count my gains.<br> The King is sickly,<br> weak, and melancholy.<br> Well, have patience, sister.<br> There's no doubt His Majesty<br> will soon recover his accustomed health.<br> But his physicians<br> fear for him mightily.<br> If he were dead, what would become of me?<br> The heavens have blessed you<br> with two goodly sons<br> to be your comforters when he's gone.<br> Oh, but they're young,<br> and their minority is put<br> into the trust of Richard Gloucester.<br> A man who loves not me,<br> nor you, my brother.<br> Is it confirmed he will be Lord Protector?<br> Yeah, if the King miscarry.<br> My love, what danger can befall to you<br> so long as Edward is your constant friend<br> and a sovereign whom Richard must obey?<br> Yes, and shall obey and love you, too.<br> Ratcliffe?<br> What's his name?<br> His name is Tyrell, sir.<br> I partly know the man.<br> Is your name Tyrell?<br> James Tyrell,<br> and your most obedient servant.<br> Are you indeed?<br> Prove me, my gracious lord.<br> Oh, I have passed a miserable night.<br> I thought that I had broken from the Tower<br> and was embarked to cross to Burgundy.<br> And in my company, my brother Richard,<br> who from my cabin<br> tempted me to walk upon the hatches.<br> As we paced along,<br> I thought that Richard stumbled<br> and, in falling,<br> struck me overboard<br> into the tumbling billows of the main.<br> Oh Lord,<br> I thought what pain it was to drown.<br> What dreadful noise of water in my ears.<br> What sights of ugly death within my eyes.<br> I thought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,<br> a thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,<br> wedges of gold, great anchors,<br> heaps of pearl,<br> inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,<br> all scattered in the bottom of the sea.<br> Some lay in dead men's skulls,<br> and in the holes<br> where eyes did once inhabit,<br> there were crept, as it were in scorn of eyes,<br> reflecting gems<br> that wooed the slimy bottom of the deep<br> and mocked the dead bones<br> that lay scattered by.<br> My dream was lengthened after life.<br> Oh, then began the tempest to my soul.<br> With that, I thought a legion of foul fiends<br> environed me<br> and howled in my ears such hideous cries<br> that, with the very noise, I trembling waked,<br> and for a season after, could not believe<br> but that I was in hell.<br> Such terrible impression made my dream.<br> Oi! Oi! Off!<br> Now then, my hardy,<br> stout-resolved mates...<br> Ah.<br> Are you now going to dispatch this thing?<br> We are, my lord, but need a warrant<br> to be admitted to where he is.<br> Well thought upon.<br> I have it here about me.<br> Be sudden in the execution,<br> for Clarence is well-spoken<br> and perhaps may move your hearts to pity.<br> We go to use our hands<br> and not our tongues.<br> I like you lads. About your business straight.<br> Your eyes drop millstones,<br> when fools' eyes fall tears.<br> Clarence has not another day to live,<br> which done,<br> God taking Edward to his mercy<br> and leave the world for me to bustle in.<br> God make Your Majesty joyful<br> as you have been.<br> - Prime Minister.<br> - Good time of day unto Your Majesty.<br> - Lord Stanley.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> Saw you the King today?<br> But now the Duke of Buckingham and I<br> are come from visiting His Majesty.<br> Did you confer with him?<br> Ma'am, we did.<br> He desires to make reconciliation<br> between Richard of Gloucester<br> and your brother here.<br> Ah, would all were well.<br> But that will never be.<br> I fear our happiness is at the height.<br> Who is it that complains unto the King,<br> that I, in truth, am stern and love them not?<br> Because I cannot flatter and look fair,<br> smile in men's faces,<br> smooth, deceive, and cog,<br> I must be held a rancorous enemy.<br> Cannot a plain man live and think no harm?<br> To whom in all this presence speaks,<br> Your Grace?<br> To you, who have neither honesty nor grace.<br> When have I injured you?<br> When done you wrong?<br> Come, come, my brother Gloucester.<br> We know your meaning.<br> The world is grown so bad<br> that wrens make prey<br> where eagles dare not perch.<br> You envy my advancement and my family,<br> God grant we never may have need of you.<br> Meantime, God grants<br> that I have need of you.<br> My brother is imprisoned by your means.<br> Richard! You do me shameful injury!<br> What would you, fellow,<br> at the Tower?<br> How came you hither?<br> I would speak with Clarence,<br> and I came hither on my legs.<br> I never did incense His Majesty<br> against your brother Clarence,<br> but have been an earnest advocate<br> to plead for him.<br> You may deny that you...<br> She may, my lord.<br> She may, Lord Rivers,<br> but who knows not so?<br> She may do more, sir, than denying that.<br> She may help you to many<br> great promotions what may she not.<br> My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long<br> borne your blunt upbraidings<br> and bitter scoffs!<br> I had rather be a country serving maid<br> than a great queen in this condition<br> to be so baited, scorned, and stormed at.<br> By heaven, I will acquaint His Majesty.<br> Tell him and spare not.<br> Look, what I have said, I will avouch it<br> in the presence of the King.<br> Before you were Queen,<br> yes, or your husband King,<br> I was a packhorse in his great affairs.<br> In all that time, you and your brother here<br> were sympathetic to the enemy.<br> Let me put in your mind, if you forget,<br> what you have been before<br> and what you are.<br> Indeed what I have been and what I am.<br> A bottled spider.<br> My dear brother-in-law,<br> in those busy days when now you try<br> to prove us enemies,<br> we followed then Edward, our lawful king.<br> So should she you if you should be her king.<br> If I should be?<br> I'd rather be a peddler.<br> I'm too childish, foolish for this world.<br> You poisonous, bunch-backed toad!<br> Have done. Have done.<br> Small joy have I<br> in being this country's queen.<br> Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog.<br> Look, when he fawns, he bites.<br> Your Majesty,<br> His Majesty has called for you.<br> What did she say, my Lord of Buckingham?<br> Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.<br> I cannot blame her,<br> by God's Holy Mother.<br> A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion<br> to pray for those<br> who have done wrong to you.<br> What? Are you afraid?<br> Not to kill him... Having a warrant for it,<br> but to be damned for killing him,<br> from which no warrant can defend me.<br> I thought you'd been resolute.<br> So I am. Let him live.<br> I'll back to Richard of Gloucester<br> and tell him so.<br> No. Wait a little.<br> Some certain dregs of conscience<br> are yet within me.<br> Remember our reward<br> when the deed's done.<br> He dies.<br> I forgot the reward.<br> And where's your conscience now?<br> In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.<br> In God's name.<br> - What are you?<br> - A man as you are.<br> But not as I am, royal.<br> Nor you, as we are, loyal.<br> Who has sent you to me<br> - and why have you come?<br> - To... To...<br> Murder me.<br> Aye.<br> But how, my friends, have I offended you?<br> Offended us you have not, but King Edward.<br> I will send you to my brother Richard<br> who shall reward you better for my life<br> than will the King for tidings of my death.<br> You are deceived.<br> Your brother Richard hates you.<br> Oh, you are wrong.<br> He loves me, and he holds me dear.<br> Go you to him. Tell him, and he will weep.<br> Aye, millstones! As he lessoned us to weep.<br> Oh, do not slander him, for he is kind.<br> Right, as snow in harvest!<br> Richard! No!<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Right, so now we have done<br> a good day's work.<br> Now, friends, continue this united league.<br> Rivers and Hastings,<br> take each other's hands.<br> Hastings,<br> my soul is purged from grudging hate.<br> Your Majesty, I truly swear the like.<br> Elizabeth, you are not exempt in this.<br> Wife, greet Lord Hastings.<br> Let him kiss your hand.<br> There, Hastings.<br> Now, princely Buckingham.<br> Make me happy in this unity.<br> Whenever Buckingham<br> does turn his hate upon Your Majesty,<br> God punish me with hate<br> from those where I expect most love.<br> When I most need to employ a friend<br> and most assured that he is a friend...<br> Richard!<br> Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile.<br> Good morrow to my sovereign King.<br> - Now, Richard...<br> - And Queen.<br> I have done a good day's work.<br> Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate.<br> It's death to me to be at enmity.<br> I hate it and desire all good men's love.<br> First, ma'am, I do entreat true peace of you,<br> which I shall purchase<br> with my duteous service.<br> Of you, my noble, dear Lord Buckingham...<br> If ever any grudge were lodged between us.<br> Of you, Lord Hastings.<br> Of you, dear Rivers,<br> who, all without desert, has frowned on me.<br> Indeed, of all.<br> I do not know that Englishman alive<br> with whom my soul is any jot at odds<br> more than the infant that is born tonight.<br> I thank my God for my humility.<br> I wish to God all strifes were settled so.<br> My sovereign lord,<br> I do beseech Your Majesty<br> to take your brother Clarence to your grace.<br> Why, ma'am, have I offered love for this?<br> Who knows not<br> that the gentle Duke is dead?<br> Who knows not he is dead?<br> Who knows he is?<br> Is Clarence dead?<br> The order was reversed!<br> But he, poor man, by your first order died,<br> and that a winged mercury did bear.<br> Some tardy cripple bore the countermand.<br> Oh, God,<br> I fear thy justice will take hold of me<br> and mine, and mine, and yours for this.<br> Rivers, help me to my bed.<br> Oh, poor Clarence!<br> This is the fruits of rashness.<br> Marked you not, Hastings,<br> how that the guilty brother<br> of the Queen looked pale<br> when he did hear of Clarence's death?<br> God will revenge it.<br> Oh, Clarence.<br> Clarence, my unhappy son.<br> This news is bad indeed.<br> What, is he in his bed?<br> He is. Oh, he has overused<br> his royal person much.<br> What means this scene of rude impatience?<br> Edward, my lord, your son,<br> our king is dead.<br> Why grow the branches<br> now the root is withered?<br> Why wither not the leaves,<br> the sap being gone?<br> Alas! I am the mother of these griefs.<br> On me pour all your tears.<br> I am your sorrow's nurse.<br> Elizabeth, have comfort.<br> We all of us have cause<br> to wail the dimming of our shining star.<br> Though we have spent<br> our harvest of this king,<br> we are to reap the harvest of his son.<br> Sister, think you like a careful mother<br> of the Prince of Wales, your son.<br> Send straight for him. Let him be crowned.<br> In him, your comfort lies.<br> Meseemeth good that,<br> with some little train,<br> the Prince be brought to London<br> to be crowned.<br> Why "with some little train,"<br> My Lord of Buckingham?<br> Lest by a multitude, dear sir,<br> the new-healed wound<br> of civil war break out.<br> I hope the King made peace with all of us.<br> And the compact is firm and true in me.<br> And so in me. And so, I think, in all.<br> Therefore, I say, with noble Buckingham,<br> it's fitting that so few<br> should meet the Prince.<br> Hmm.<br> - Prime Minister?<br> - And so say I.<br> Then be it so.<br> Two mirrors of my husband's likeness<br> are cracked in pieces by malignant death.<br> And I, for comfort, have but one false glass<br> that grieves me<br> when I see my shame in him.<br> Ma'am.<br> Mother, I do humbly crave your blessing.<br> God comfort you<br> and put meekness in your breast,<br> love, charity, obedience and true duty!<br> Amen.<br> And make me die a good old man.<br> That's the butt-end of a mother's blessing.<br> I marvel that Her Grace did leave it out.<br> My Lord Protector.<br> My Lord Protector,<br> whoever journeys to the Prince,<br> for God's sake, let not us two stay at home.<br> And let us part Earl Rivers from the Prince.<br> My other self.<br> I long with all my heart<br> to see the Prince of Wales.<br> I hope he is much grown<br> since last I saw him.<br> They say my uncle Richard grew so fast<br> that he could gnaw a crust at two-hours old.<br> Oh, go to, you parlous boy,<br> you are too shrewd.<br> Elizabeth, be not angry with your son.<br> Pitchers have ears.<br> Lord Stanley.<br> Richmond.<br> What news?<br> Such news that grieves me to report.<br> What is your news?<br> Your brother Rivers is murdered.<br> By whom?<br> Richmond?<br> Richard and Buckingham.<br> I see the ruin of my family.<br> Welcome, dear nephew.<br> Welcome to your capital.<br> I wanted more uncles here to welcome me.<br> Those uncles who you want<br> were dangerous.<br> Your Highness attended<br> to their sugared words<br> and looked not on the poison of their hearts.<br> God keep you from them<br> and from such false friends.<br> God keep me from false friends?<br> But they were none.<br> The Prime Minister Lord Hastings<br> comes to greet you.<br> - Hastings.<br> - Uncle Richard!<br> Catesby, is it not an easy matter<br> to make Lord Hastings of our mind<br> for the installment of this noble Duke<br> in the seat royal of our famous land?<br> He, for the late King's sake,<br> so loves the Prince<br> that he will not do anything against him.<br> What think you, then,<br> of Lord Stanley<br> and the Archbishop?<br> They will do, all in all, as Hastings does.<br> Call them tomorrow early,<br> to determine of the coronation.<br> And as it were far off,<br> sound out Lord Hastings<br> and give us notice of his inclination.<br> Commend me to Hastings.<br> Tell him, Catesby, that Rivers is let blood.<br> - Uncle!<br> - Oh! Oof!<br> What would you have, my little lord?<br> Because I am little like an ape,<br> I think that you should<br> bear me on your shoulders.<br> - Uncle Richard?<br> - Hmm?<br> Stanley.<br> Where shall we stay until our coronation?<br> If I may counsel you, some day or two<br> for your best health and recreation,<br> Your Highness shall repose you<br> at the Tower.<br> I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.<br> Why? What should you fear?<br> My uncle Clarence's angry ghost.<br> Oh.<br> My grandma told me<br> he was murdered there.<br> I fear no uncles dead.<br> Nor none who live, I hope.<br> So wise, so young, they say,<br> do never live long.<br> Well, let them rest.<br> My Lord Protector, what shall we do<br> if we perceive Hastings<br> will not yield to our plans?<br> Chop off his head.<br> Something we shall determine.<br> And, look, when I am king...<br> Claim you of me the Earldom of Hereford<br> and all the movables whereof<br> the King, my brother, was possessed.<br> I'll claim that promise of your royal hand.<br> And look to have it yielded<br> with all kindness.<br> Come, let's to supper.<br> And then?<br> My uncle dreamt tonight<br> that the boar had shown his tusks.<br> Therefore he sends to know<br> if you will shun the danger<br> that his soul does fear.<br> Return to Lord Stanley.<br> Tell him his fears are shallow,<br> wanting substance.<br> As for his dreams, I wonder he's so foolish.<br> Morning, Catesby.<br> Tell your uncle I shall see him at<br> the meeting<br> where he shall see "the boar"<br> will use us kindly.<br> Catesby, what news in this,<br> our tottering state?<br> It is a reeling world indeed, sir.<br> And, I believe, will never stand upright<br> till Richard wear the garland of the state.<br> How wear the garland?<br> - Do you mean the crown?<br> - Yes, my lord.<br> I'll have this crown of mine<br> cut from my shoulders<br> before I see the crown so foul misplaced.<br> - Hastings.<br> - Where's your boar-spear, Lord Stanley?<br> - Hastings...<br> - Catesby,<br> before a fortnight makes me older,<br> I'll send some packing<br> that yet think not on it.<br> It is a vile thing to die<br> when men are unprepared<br> and look not for it.<br> - Archbishop, you're early stirring.<br> - I'm glad to see you, Prime Minister.<br> What, talking with a priest, Hastings?<br> Your friend Rivers, he needed a priest.<br> - What is it o'clock?<br> - On the stroke of two.<br> Now, gentlemen, the cause why we are<br> met is to determine of the coronation.<br> Oh, speak. When is the royal day?<br> Are all things ready?<br> They are.<br> Who knows the Lord Protector's<br> mind in this?<br> Your Lordship, we think,<br> should soonest know his mind.<br> We know each other's faces.<br> For our hearts, he knows<br> no more of mine than I of yours.<br> Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.<br> Hastings, you and he are near in love.<br> I have not sounded him,<br> but you, my noble lords,<br> may name the time,<br> and on the Duke's behalf, I'll give my voice.<br> Good day to you all.<br> Oh, I've been long a sleeper.<br> Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,<br> William Lord Hastings<br> had pronounced your part.<br> Then, my Lord Hastings,<br> no man might be bolder.<br> He knows me well and loves me well.<br> I pray you all...<br> Tell me what they deserve<br> who do conspire my death.<br> And have prevailed upon my body<br> with their damned witchcraft.<br> I'll say, my lord, they have deserved death.<br> Let be your eyes the witness of their evil.<br> See how I am bewitched.<br> Behold.<br> My arm is like a blasted sapling,<br> withered up<br> by Queen Elizabeth, that monstrous witch.<br> If she has done this deed, my noble lord...<br> If?<br> You, protector of this damned Elizabeth.<br> Talk you to me of "ifs"?<br> You are a traitor.<br> Off with his head!<br> Now, by Saint Paul I swear<br> I will not dine until I see the same!<br> The rest that love me, rise and follow me!<br> The Duke would be at dinner<br> and longs to see your head.<br> So dear, I loved the man<br> that I must weep.<br> Would you imagine that<br> the subtle traitor had plotted<br> in the Parliament to murder me?<br> And the Lord Protector?<br> Had he done so?<br> Lord Mayor, the civil peace<br> enforced us to this execution.<br> Now he deserved his death.<br> And do not doubt but that I shall acquaint<br> my duteous city colleagues<br> with all your just proceedings in this cause.<br> Buckingham, go after to the council house.<br> Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.<br> Moreover, urge Edward's hateful lechery<br> which stretched unto<br> their servants, daughters, wives.<br> Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator<br> as if the golden fee for which I plead<br> were for myself.<br> Catesby.<br> Give order that no manner<br> of person have any time recourse<br> unto the princes.<br> When scarce the blood<br> was well-washed from his hands<br> which issued from my other, angel husband.<br> Oh, when I say I looked on Richard's face,<br> this was my wish.<br> "Be you," I said, "accursed.<br> "And when you wed,<br> let sorrow haunt your bed."<br> Within so small a time,<br> my woman's heart<br> grossly grew captive to his honey words,<br> and proved subject to my own soul's curse.<br> Buckingham, what say the citizens?<br> Did you infer the bastardy<br> of Edward's children?<br> I did.<br> The insatiate greediness of his desire,<br> his tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy.<br> Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,<br> your bounty, virtue,<br> fair humility.<br> And when my oratory drew to an end,<br> I bade those who did love<br> their country's good<br> cry, "God save King Richard,<br> England's royal king!"<br> - And did they so?<br> - No.<br> - So God help me, they spoke not a word.<br> - Bah!<br> What tongue-less blocks are they!<br> Would they not speak?<br> The Lord Mayor<br> and his colleagues have arrived.<br> Pretend some fear.<br> Be not easily won by our requests.<br> And look, you,<br> put a prayer book in your hand.<br> Play the maid's part.<br> Still answer no and take it.<br> - Ratcliffe.<br> - No doubt we'll bring it to a happy issue.<br> You shall see what I can do.<br> Catesby.<br> He does entreat you, my Lord Buckingham,<br> to visit him tomorrow or next day.<br> He is within,<br> with two right reverend priests.<br> Tell him myself, the Mayor,<br> and these gentlemen have come<br> to have some conference with him.<br> I'll tell him what you say, my lord.<br> Ah, Lord Mayor.<br> Richard is not King Edward.<br> He is not lulling on a lewd love-bed,<br> but meditating with two deep divines,<br> praying to enrich his watchful soul.<br> Happy were England<br> would this virtuous man<br> take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof.<br> - God defend Richard should say no to us.<br> - I fear he will.<br> - Catesby.<br> - He wonders to what end<br> you have assembled such troops<br> of citizens to speak with him.<br> My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.<br> By heaven, we come to him in perfect love.<br> My Lord Protector?<br> Pray pardon us<br> the interruption of your devotions.<br> My lord, there needs no such apology.<br> - I do suspect I have done some offense.<br> - You have.<br> Will it please you to amend your fault?<br> Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?<br> Know then, it is your fault<br> that you refuse the supreme seat,<br> the throne majestical.<br> We heartily solicit you take on<br> the kingly government of this your land,<br> not as Lord Protector,<br> but from blood to blood,<br> your right of birth, your empery, your own.<br> Your love deserves my thanks.<br> But my desert unmeritable,<br> shuns your high request.<br> First if all obstacles were... cut away,<br> yet, so much is my poverty of spirit,<br> so mighty and so many my defects,<br> that I should rather<br> hide me from my greatness.<br> But God be thanked, there is no need of me.<br> The royal tree has left us royal fruit.<br> You say the Prince of Wales<br> is your brother's son?<br> So say we, but born before his wedding day.<br> Then, good my lord, take to your royal self<br> this proffered benefit of dignity.<br> - Good my Lord Protector...<br> - We entreat you.<br> Refuse not, Gloucester, this proffered love!<br> Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear.<br> I am unfit for state and majesty.<br> Then we will plant<br> some other on the throne.<br> I do beseech you take it not amiss.<br> I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.<br> Your brother's son will never reign our king.<br> Gentlemen, come! I will entreat no more.<br> God's wounds!<br> Oh, do not swear, my Lord of Buckingham!<br> Call him again, my lord. Accept the crown.<br> Will you enforce me to a world of cares?<br> Call him again.<br> My lord. My Lord Buckingham!<br> I'm not made of stone.<br> Gentlemen, since you will<br> buckle fortune on my back,<br> I must have patience...<br> To endure the load.<br> But God doth know, and you may partly see,<br> how far I am<br> from the desire of this.<br> If you will outstrip death,<br> go across the seas and live,<br> dear Richmond, from the reach of hell.<br> Go, my dear nephew,<br> from this slaughterhouse.<br> Long live King Richard!<br> Richard! Richard! Richard!<br> Brackenbury, how are my sons, the princes?<br> Right well, Your Majesty.<br> By your patience,<br> I may not permit you to visit them.<br> - The King has strictly charged the contrary.<br> - The King!<br> - I mean, the Lord Protector.<br> - The Lord protect him from that kingly title.<br> I am their mother.<br> Who should keep me from them?<br> I am bound by oath.<br> And therefore, pardon me.<br> Go you to Richard,<br> and good angels guard you.<br> Stay yet.<br> Look back with me unto the Tower.<br> Pity, you ancient stones,<br> those tender princes<br> whom envy has immured within your walls.<br> Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.<br> Rude, ragged nurse, use my babies well.<br> Now, Buckingham!<br> Thus high, by your advice<br> and your assistance, is King Richard seated.<br> But shall we wear these glories for a day,<br> or shall they last and we rejoice in them?<br> Still live they, and forever let them last.<br> The princes live.<br> - Think now what I would speak.<br> - Say on, Your Majesty.<br> - Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.<br> - Why so you are!<br> The princes live.<br> Buckingham, you never used to be so dull.<br> Shall I be plain?<br> I wish the bastards dead,<br> and I would have it suddenly performed.<br> What say you now?<br> Speak suddenly, be brief.<br> Your Majesty may do your pleasure.<br> Tut, tut, you are all ice.<br> Your kindness freezes.<br> Say, have I your consent that they shall die?<br> Give me some little breath,<br> some pause, Your Majesty,<br> before I positively speak in this.<br> High reaching,<br> Buckingham grows circumspect.<br> Has he held out so long with me untired<br> and stops he now for breath?<br> Well...<br> Be it so.<br> Lord Stanley!<br> Your Majesty.<br> What's the news?<br> The Archbishop, as I hear,<br> has joined with Richmond in France,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Richmond aims to marry young Elizabeth,<br> my brother Edward's daughter,<br> and by that knot,<br> he hopes to gain my crown.<br> Richmond is your nephew.<br> Well... Look to it.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - Catesby!<br> Rumor it abroad that Anne,<br> my wife, is very grievous sick.<br> Look how you dream! I say again,<br> give out that Anne, my queen, is sick<br> and like to die.<br> Tyrell.<br> I must be married now to young Elizabeth,<br> or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.<br> Murder her brothers and then marry her.<br> Tyrell.<br> Dare you resolve to kill a friend of mine?<br> Sir, please you, I'd rather kill two enemies.<br> There you have it. Two deep enemies.<br> Tyrell...<br> I mean those bastards in the Tower.<br> Say it is done, and I will love you for it.<br> It... is... done.<br> Your Majesty.<br> Your Majesty,<br> I claim the earldom of Hereford,<br> which you promised I should possess.<br> Well, let that rest.<br> - The Archbishop has fled to Richmond.<br> - I hear the news.<br> What says Your Majesty to my just request?<br> As I remember, it was prophesied<br> that Richmond should be king.<br> A king. Perhaps. Perhaps.<br> - Your promise for the earldom.<br> - Riche monde.<br> - Your Majesty, I...<br> - Yes. What's o'clock?<br> I am thus bold to put Your Majesty<br> in mind of what you promised me.<br> Well, but what's o'clock?<br> - Upon the stroke of ten.<br> - Then let it strike.<br> Why let it strike?<br> Because that, like a jack,<br> you keep the stroke<br> between your begging and my meditation.<br> I am not in the giving vein today.<br> Why then, resolve me<br> whether you will or no.<br> You trouble me! I am not in the vein!<br> Never yet one hour in his bed<br> have I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep,<br> but have been woken<br> by his timorous dreams.<br> Besides, he hates me<br> and will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.<br> Let me think of Hastings and be gone.<br> Kind Tyrell.<br> Am I happy in your news?<br> It is done, Your Majesty.<br> But did you see them dead...<br> And buried?<br> I did, Your Majesty.<br> Gentle Tyrell, come to me, Tyrell, soon,<br> at after supper...<br> When you shall tell the story of their death.<br> Meanwhile, but think<br> how I may do you good<br> and be inheritor of your desire.<br> The sons of Edward sleep<br> in Abraham's bosom.<br> And Anne...<br> My wife shall bid this world good night.<br> Uncertain way of gain,<br> but I am in so far in blood<br> that sin will pluck on sin.<br> Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.<br> - Your Majesty!<br> - Ratcliffe.<br> Upon the southern coast,<br> there rides a powerful navy.<br> It's thought that Richmond is its admiral.<br> Buckingham has fled<br> to welcome him ashore.<br> We must be brief<br> when traitors brave the field.<br> Are you my son?<br> Yes, I thank God, my father, and yourself.<br> You toad!<br> Where are the princes?<br> And your wife?<br> Mother, I have a touch of your condition<br> that cannot brook the accent of reproof.<br> - Oh, let me speak!<br> - Be brief, dear Mother, for I am in haste.<br> - A grievous burden was your birth to me.<br> - And came I not, at last, to comfort you?<br> You came on earth<br> to make the earth my hell.<br> Tetchy and wayward was your infancy,<br> your schooldays frightful,<br> desperate, wild and furious.<br> Your prime of manhood daring,<br> bold and adventurous.<br> Your age confirmed, proud,<br> subtle, sly and bloody.<br> What comfortable hour can you name<br> that ever graced me with your company?<br> If I be so disgracious...<br> Oh, hear me a little,<br> for I shall never speak to you again.<br> So?<br> To war take with you<br> my most grievous curse.<br> My prayers shall on Richmond's party fight.<br> Bloody you are, bloody will be your end.<br> Shame serves your life<br> and will your death attend.<br> I leave for France.<br> Be not tongue-tied.<br> You are a dream of what you were,<br> a breath, a queen in jest.<br> Where is your husband now?<br> Where is your brother?<br> Where are your two sons? Wherein joy?<br> Who sues and kneels and says,<br> "God save the Queen"?<br> Where are the bended peers<br> that flatter you?<br> Where be the thronging troops<br> that followed you?<br> Teach me how to curse my enemy!<br> Forbear to sleep the nights<br> and fast the days.<br> Think that your babes<br> were sweeter than they were,<br> and he that slew them, fouler than he is!<br> Tell me, you villain slave,<br> where are my children?<br> Where is my brother Rivers<br> and your brother Clarence?<br> Where is Lord Hastings?<br> Elizabeth!<br> I must talk a word with you.<br> I've no more sons of the royal blood<br> for you to slaughter.<br> You have a daughter...<br> Called Elizabeth.<br> Must she die for this?<br> Oh, let her live.<br> - Her life is safest only in her birth.<br> - And only in that safety died her brothers.<br> You speak as if that I had slain the princes.<br> No doubt the murderous knife<br> was dull and blunt<br> till it was sharpened<br> on your stone-hard heart<br> to revel in the entrails of my lambs.<br> Ma'am, I intend more good to you and yours<br> than ever you or yours by me were harmed.<br> Tell me what state, what dignity,<br> what honor can you bestow<br> on any child of mine?<br> Even all I have...<br> Yes, and myself and all<br> will I withal endow a child of yours.<br> Be brief, lest that the process<br> of your kindness<br> last longer telling than your kindness date.<br> Know then, that with my soul<br> I love your daughter<br> and do intend to make her<br> Queen of England.<br> You! What!<br> You?<br> - What think you of it?<br> - How can you woo her?<br> Now that would I learn of you.<br> - And will you learn of me?<br> - Madam, with all my heart.<br> Send to her, by the man<br> who slew her brothers,<br> a pair of bleeding hearts,<br> then will she weep.<br> If this inducement move her not,<br> send her a letter of your noble deeds.<br> Tell her you made away<br> her uncle Clarence, her uncle Rivers.<br> Yes, and for her sake,<br> made quick conveyance<br> with her good aunt Anne.<br> You mock me, madam. This is not<br> the way to win your daughter.<br> There is no other way, unless you<br> could put on some other shape<br> and not be Richard who's done all this.<br> Say, that I did all this for love of her.<br> Well, then, she cannot choose but hate you.<br> What is done cannot be now amended.<br> Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes.<br> If I did take the kingdom from your sons,<br> to make amends,<br> I'll give it to your daughter.<br> Again you shall be mother of a king.<br> What! We have many goodly days to see.<br> The liquid drops of tears that you have shed<br> shall come again,<br> transformed to orient pearl.<br> Go then, my mother. To your daughter, go.<br> Make bold her bashful years<br> with your experience.<br> Acquaint the Princess with the sweet,<br> silent hours of marriage joys.<br> And when these troops of mine<br> have chastised the petty rebel<br> Richmond and dull-brained Buckingham,<br> bound with triumphant garlands will I come<br> and lead your daughter<br> to a conqueror's bed.<br> What were I best to say?<br> Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.<br> To wail the title as her mother does?<br> Say, I will love her everlastingly.<br> But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?<br> As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.<br> As long as hell and Richard like of it!<br> Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.<br> Oh, no! My reasons are too deep and dead.<br> Too deep and dead,<br> my infants, in their graves.<br> Harp not on that string, madam.<br> That is past.<br> Harp on it still shall I till heart strings break!<br> I know that Richmond aims<br> to wed Elizabeth.<br> In her consists my happiness, and yours.<br> Without her, follows to myself and you,<br> herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,<br> death, desolation, ruin and decay.<br> It cannot be avoided but by this.<br> Be the attorney of my love to her.<br> Plead what I will be...<br> Not what I've been.<br> Shall I be tempted by the devil thus?<br> Yes, if the devil tempt you to do good.<br> But you did kill my children.<br> But in your daughter's womb, I bury them,<br> where, in that nest of spicery,<br> they will breed.<br> Shall I go win my daughter to your will?<br> And be a happy mother by the deed.<br> Write to me very shortly,<br> and you shall understand from me her mind.<br> Bear her my true love's kiss.<br> Farewell.<br> Relenting fool...<br> That shallow, changing woman.<br> Lord Stanley!<br> What's the news with you?<br> None good, Your Majesty, nor none so bad.<br> Hoyday, a riddle. Neither good nor bad.<br> - Once more, what news?<br> - Richmond is on the sea.<br> Then be the seas on him.<br> What does he there?<br> - Your Majesty, I know not but by guess.<br> - Well, as you guess?<br> Stirred up by Buckingham,<br> he makes for England,<br> - here to claim the crown.<br> - Is the throne empty?<br> Is the King dead?<br> You will revolt and fly to him, I fear.<br> I never was, nor never will be false.<br> Go, then, and muster men.<br> But leave behind with us<br> your son young George.<br> Stanley, look your heart be firm,<br> or else his head's assurance is but frail.<br> You Majesty.<br> - The Duke of Buckingham...<br> - Till you bring better news!<br> The Duke of Buckingham is taken prisoner.<br> I cry you mercy.<br> Richmond is landed<br> with a mighty power from France.<br> Let's go to meet him.<br> While we reason here,<br> a royal battle might be won and lost.<br> Tyrell!
