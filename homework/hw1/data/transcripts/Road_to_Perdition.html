                        There are many stories<br> about Michael Sullivan.<br> Some say he was a decent man.<br> Some say there was no good<br> in him at all.<br> But I once spent six weeks<br> on the road with him...<br> ...in the winter of 1931.<br> This is our story.<br> Thank you, sir. Much obliged.<br> Man dies in factory accident!<br> Get your paper here!<br> Hot off the press, only 5 cents!<br> Thanks, Mr. Miller.<br> I'll help you with it later.<br> You go fetch your father.<br> Pa?<br> Dinner's ready.<br> Thank you.<br> Bless us, O Lord, for thy gifts<br> we are about to receive...<br> ...through the bounty of Jesus Christ,<br> our Lord. Amen.<br> -Michael?<br> -Sir?<br> It's a wake, so I don't want to see<br> those dice.<br> No, sir.<br> Hello.<br> I don't wanna go.<br> -Come on, it's all right.<br> -No. I'm scared.<br> Ice helps preserve the body.<br> So...<br> ...who's got a hug<br> for a lonely old man?<br> Now then, which is which?<br> Don't help me.<br> -Peter and Michael.<br> -No!<br> Annie, Mike, good to see you.<br> -Did you bring the necessary?<br> -Yes.<br> If you'll excuse me, I have urgent<br> business with these young gentlemen.<br> -Yeah!<br> -Winner!<br> Call the cops!<br> I know hustlers when I see them.<br> -I don't hustle, old-timer.<br> -Pay the man.<br> Upstairs.<br> Jacket pocket, in my study.<br> Before I change my mind.<br> -Hello?<br> -Hello.<br> Remind me,<br> which little Sullivan are you?<br> -Michael, sir.<br> -Sir? You don't have to call me sir.<br> I'm not your pa.<br> No, Mr. Rooney.<br> Call me Connor.<br> No, call me Uncle Connor.<br> What do you want?<br> Mr. Rooney sent me to get his jacket.<br> You come back later, huh?<br> I'm busy.<br> Yes... Sir.<br> Hello, hello.<br> I want to welcome all of you<br> to my home.<br> It's good to have so many friends<br> in this house again.<br> Since Mary died, it's...<br> Well, it's just been me and my boy<br> rattling around in these rooms.<br> I had this speech prepared,<br> but it would be...<br> ...dishonest of me to say that<br> I knew Danny well.<br> But lose one of us, it hurts us all.<br> I'll tell you what I do remember, though,<br> and Finn will remember this too...<br> ...and that's Danny<br> on the high school football team.<br> A championship game. Down six points,<br> ...four yards to go,<br> Danny tackles his own quarterback.<br> Mistakes, you know...<br> We all make them. God knows.<br> Let's drink to Danny's honor.<br> Let's swig him to God and hope<br> that he gets to heaven...<br> ...at least an hour before<br> the devil finds out he's dead.<br> -Amen.<br> -To Danny!<br> And now, I would like to ask<br> a dear and a trusted friend...<br> ...Finn McGovern, to say a few words...<br> ...words that I'll wager<br> got more poetry than mine.<br> Get over here.<br> Thank you, John.<br> "My brother Danny wasn't wise.<br> Nor was he gentle.<br> And with a skinful of liquor in him,<br> he was a pain in the ass.<br> But he was loyal and brave.<br> And he never told a lie.<br> He'd have enjoyed this party.<br> Me and the family, we wanna say<br> thank you to our generous host.<br> Where would this town be<br> without Mr. John Rooney?"<br> I've worked for you<br> for many years now, John.<br> Nearly half my life.<br> And we've never had a disagreement.<br> I've come to realize<br> that you rule this town...<br> ...as God rules the earth.<br> -You give, and you take away...<br> -Lovely. Lovely speech.<br> I'm gonna bury my brother.<br> Then I'm gonna deal with you.<br> Sure, Finn, sure.<br> You'll take care of all of us.<br> Once you get a good night's sleep.<br> -He all right?<br> -Yeah, he's fine.<br> Just too much to drink.<br> I'll talk to him.<br> -Take Mike with you.<br> -No, Pa...<br> Take Mike with you.<br> Just talk, nothing more.<br> Why are you always smiling?<br> 'Cause it's all so fucking hysterical.<br> Michael.<br> What?<br> I had a nightmare.<br> It was about Mr. Rooney's house.<br> It's just a house.<br> A big house.<br> Go back to sleep.<br> Is Mr. Rooney rich like the Babe?<br> Richer.<br> Are we rich?<br> No, stupid.<br> What's Papa's job?<br> He works for Mr. Rooney.<br> Why?<br> Well, Papa didn't have a father...<br> ...so Mr. Rooney looked after him.<br> I know that, but what's his job?<br> He goes on missions for Mr. Rooney.<br> They're very dangerous.<br> That's why he brings his gun.<br> Sometimes even the president<br> sends him on missions...<br> ...'cause Papa was a war hero and all.<br> -You're just making that up.<br> -I am not.<br> It's all so fucking hysterical.<br> Peter, I can't come to your concert<br> tonight. I'm working.<br> Working at what?<br> Putting food on your plate, young man.<br> All right, boys, come on,<br> clear the plates.<br> You're a good lad.<br> -You want a shot?<br> -No.<br> We're just talking to him, right?<br> Sure.<br> Don't get me wrong, Finn.<br> I feel for you. I do.<br> You can't let a thing like that<br> give you cause to go mouthing off.<br> You and my dad,<br> you go back many years...<br> ...and he is a just man.<br> So, what do you say?<br> Come on now, Finn.<br> Make this easy.<br> We can't hear you.<br> -All right.<br> -Good.<br> Thank you.<br> I am sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.<br> I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.<br> And I'm sorry your brother was<br> such a fucking liar.<br> -My brother was not a liar.<br> -Excuse me?<br> To protect my family and keep my job,<br> I'll stay quiet.<br> But don't think I don't know<br> something's going on.<br> -Don't think I won't find out what it is.<br> -Whoa, buddy...<br> Easy, easy.<br> Easy.<br> We're just talking. You tell your father<br> my brother never stole from him.<br> I've checked the books. He never sold<br> booze to no one. It's all accounted for.<br> -If he sold it, where's the money?<br> -Fuck should I know?<br> -Did you check his mattress?<br> -Maybe you should check yours.<br> There's something immoral here,<br> don't you think, Mike?<br> My beloved father throws your<br> undeserving little brother...<br> ...the wake of his life, and this...<br> This is your thank-you?<br> -What a hideous world this is.<br> -You think you're so smart.<br> You think we don't know? You're<br> spending so much time in Chicago...<br> What was that?<br> We're out of here.<br> Jesus Christ, Connor,<br> what the hell are you thinking?!<br> Jesus.<br> Michael.<br> Are you hurt?<br> You saw everything?<br> Jesus.<br> You are not to speak of this to anyone.<br> You understand?<br> Not to anyone!<br> Who's this?<br> It's one of yours?<br> He must have been hiding in the car.<br> Well, can he keep a secret?<br> He's my son.<br> Well, that's good enough for me.<br> You take him home.<br> Think I'll walk.<br> Perfect night for a stroll.<br> Does Mama know?<br> Your mother knows I love Mr. Rooney.<br> When we had nothing...<br> ...he gave us a home, a life.<br> We owe him.<br> Do you understand?<br> Do you understand?<br> Yes.<br> Well, come on inside, then.<br> Boys, clear your plates, please.<br> I'll do it later.<br> -It's time for school now...<br> -It's only a plate!<br> What's he doing here?<br> Michael was hiding in the car...<br> ...when I went out last night.<br> Jesus, Mike.<br> I've spoken to him.<br> It won't happen again.<br> Mom. Mom!<br> Just the feller...<br> Our secret, right?<br> I'm talking about the dice.<br> A man of honor always pays his debts.<br> And keeps his word.<br> I'm gonna be late for school.<br> How is Michael? Is he okay?<br> I've spoken to him.<br> He understands.<br> That's tough...<br> ...seeing that for the first time.<br> Well, you turned out.<br> You can't protect them forever.<br> If it wasn't this,<br> it'd be something else.<br> Natural law.<br> Sons are put on this earth<br> to trouble their fathers.<br> John's also made it clear that<br> Finn McGovern's operation...<br> ...will be divided up locally...<br> ...among two territories that John<br> will select personally.<br> I'd like to take this moment<br> to thank Mr. Rance for...<br> ...interrupting a busy travel schedule<br> to pay us a visit.<br> Thank you, Jack.<br> Mr. Rance met with John and me earlier<br> to make another bid...<br> ...for our involvement in the unions.<br> And I told Mr. Rance<br> what I told him before:<br> What men do after work<br> is what made us rich.<br> No need to screw them at work<br> as well.<br> -Is there any other business?<br> -Yes.<br> Connor, is there something<br> you would like to say about last night?<br> I'd like to apologize for what happened.<br> Especially to you, Pa.<br> Two wakes in a month...<br> What can I say?<br> We lost a good man last night.<br> You think it's funny?<br> Try again.<br> I'd like to apologize...<br> You would like to apologize?<br> Try again.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...my apologies.<br> Is everyone clear about bit borrowers?<br> There have been far too many<br> debts outstanding.<br> -Mike...<br> -Just give me their names.<br> Tell me who to visit.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> Come on upstairs.<br> Mike.<br> Dad forgot to give you this.<br> It's just a reminder for Tony Calvino.<br> He's light again.<br> Are you coming?<br> No, I'm under house arrest for a while.<br> Look, I'm sorry about last night. I am.<br> I was... Yeah.<br> All right.<br> -Help you, sir? Or just looking?<br> -Here to see Tony Calvino.<br> Yeah, and who are you?<br> Mike Sullivan.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You gonna frisk me?<br> -Should I?<br> -It's a good idea.<br> That's the only one.<br> I mean, I'm a grown man<br> and this place is getting to me.<br> Every night there's trouble.<br> No one's got no dough,<br> but all the world's here wasting it.<br> Always money for frills and twists,<br> and never money for food.<br> Sometimes I despair the species,<br> you know?<br> Number 12 in the beauty parlor.<br> Who's the lucky face?<br> I'm not from here originally, but jobs<br> ain't hanging off trees, you know.<br> I'm a boxer by trade.<br> Nine consecutive titles.<br> That's a record in South Orange.<br> I'd make a pretty good bodyguard,<br> I think.<br> What I'm saying is,<br> is Mr. Rooney looking for anyone?<br> You know, anyone like me, for example?<br> Is there any chance you might ask him?<br> -Sure.<br> -Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Mr. Calvino?<br> Mr. Calvino, Mike Sullivan's here.<br> -Shit.<br> -He wants to see you.<br> -Shit. Is he packing?<br> -Not anymore.<br> All right.<br> Show him in.<br> Hey, hey, hey.<br> You stick around, okay?<br> Hey!<br> How the hell are you?<br> Things good with the old man?<br> Yeah.<br> What brings you here?<br> Don't imagine it's the pussy.<br> -I have a letter for you from Mr. Rooney.<br> -Am I behind again?<br> -Am I in trouble?<br> -I don't know.<br> Michael.<br> No!<br> No! My God!<br> -Pa, I'm sorry.<br> -Stupid!<br> The kid would've talked. I'm sorry.<br> Goddamn you. Goddamn you!<br> I curse the fucking day you were born!<br> I curse it!<br> You!<br> Oh, Lord.<br> Oh, Lord. God help us.<br> God help us.<br> This house is not our home anymore.<br> It's just an empty building.<br> All right, you stay here.<br> You stay out of sight.<br> -Don't go, Pa. Don't go.<br> -Michael...<br> ...when they find out we're gone,<br> they're gonna come after us.<br> I have to protect you now.<br> Please, Pa.<br> All right, here, take this.<br> -No. I don't want it.<br> -Take it.<br> -I don't want it.<br> -Boy, take it! You got six shots.<br> If I'm not back in half an hour, go tell<br> Reverend Lynch what's happened.<br> Do not go to Father Callaway.<br> I don't have any business with you,<br> Mr. Kelly.<br> But I have business with you, Mike.<br> Go ahead.<br> What is that?<br> to know there's more if you need it.<br> You have friends in Ireland, Mike.<br> Why don't you take Peter and leave?<br> I can't take Peter.<br> He's dead.<br> -So where's Connor?<br> -He's in hiding.<br> -Where?<br> -You know I can't tell you that.<br> You think sticking a gun to my head<br> is gonna make any difference to me?<br> If I tell you, I'm a dead man anyway.<br> We both are.<br> Think, Mike. Don't be stupid.<br> I'm just the messenger.<br> Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.<br> What is it?<br> Give me the gun.<br> Where are we going?<br> To Chicago.<br> There's a man there who runs things.<br> I've done some work for him.<br> We have to find out where he stands.<br> Try to get some sleep.<br> I want you to wait for me here.<br> -Sure.<br> -I won't be long. You'll be all right?<br> -Yeah, I'll be all right.<br> -That's a good boy.<br> -Hello, Mike.<br> -Hello, fellas.<br> It's nice to see you. We heard what<br> happened. How you holding up?<br> I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.<br> -He's awful busy.<br> -I can wait.<br> Okay. Take the man to the top.<br> Certainly, sir.<br> Sorry to make you wait so long, Mike.<br> Come on in.<br> We all just heard what happened.<br> Jesus, I'm sorry, Mike.<br> Well, thank you for seeing me,<br> Mr. Nitti.<br> Come on, sit down.<br> -Like some coffee or?<br> -No.<br> -You sure?<br> -Yes, thank you.<br> So, what can I do for you, Mike?<br> I'd like to work for you.<br> Well, that's very interesting.<br> And in return, I'd like you to turn<br> a blind eye to what I have to do.<br> And what is that?<br> Kill the man who murdered my family.<br> Is one more body<br> gonna make a difference?<br> This is a good proposal, Mr. Nitti.<br> I will work only for you,<br> and you know I can do a good job.<br> I respect you, Mike. I do.<br> We would like nothing more than to have<br> you come work for us. But not like this.<br> What you're asking me is impossible.<br> Is it?<br> Let me explain something to you<br> that maybe you haven't realized.<br> All these years, you've been living<br> under the protection...<br> ...of people who care about you.<br> And those same people<br> are protecting you now, including me.<br> So if you go ahead with this,<br> if you open that door...<br> ...you're walking through it alone.<br> And all that loyalty, all that trust,<br> will no longer exist for you.<br> And Mike, you won't make it.<br> Not on your own.<br> And not with a little boy.<br> You're protecting him already?<br> We're protecting our interests, Mike.<br> I drove all through the night<br> to see you.<br> I appreciate that.<br> Now I suggest you drive yourself back.<br> Go home, Mike.<br> Go home and bury your wife and child.<br> With our blessing.<br> It won't be that simple.<br> You heard?<br> Dad, listen to me.<br> He's in the building.<br> -You can end this now. Take him now.<br> -Connor, get upstairs.<br> God help me.<br> God help me. What do I do?<br> You think objectively.<br> And you make your choice.<br> What would you do if Sullivan<br> were just some guy?<br> God help me.<br> -Make it quick.<br> -And the kid?<br> Oh, Christ.

When I say we're<br> stopping to eat, you stay with me.<br> You listen to me from now on,<br> or you start taking care of yourself.<br> I can take care of myself fine!<br> You never wanted me along anyway.<br> -You think it's my fault this happened.<br> -Stop it.<br> It was not your fault!<br> None of this is your fault.<br> -Just take me to Aunt Sarah's.<br> -I can't take you there.<br> Not now.<br> -Why?<br> -He knows that's where we're going.<br> So, what are you gonna do?<br> Something I can't do alone.<br> You have to listen to me now, okay?<br> Or else both of us are dead.<br> I have to make Capone give up Connor.<br> There's one thing Chicago loves<br> more than anything...<br> ...and that's their money.<br> They've got it in banks all over the<br> state. We have to find it and take it.<br> -Are you gonna help me?<br> -Yes.<br> Then I have to teach you something.<br> -You know what the clutch is?<br> -Sure I know what the clutch is.<br> -What is the clutch?<br> -The clutch, it... It clutches.<br> Right, it clutches.<br> Which of those pedals is the clutch?<br> That's the gas.<br> Gas. I'll show you.<br> There.

I've told you once,<br> now I'm telling you again...<br> -I'm looking for a Mr. McDougal.<br> -Just one moment.<br> Well, this is a pleasant surprise.<br> I wasn't expecting another<br> deposit until the end of the month.<br> Actually, I'm making a withdrawal.<br> I want dirty money only.<br> Everything you're holding for Capone<br> that's off the books. Open the safe.<br> You're insane.<br> You know they'll find out who you are.<br> The name's Sullivan.<br> You want me to spell it?<br> Open the box.<br> They'll kill you. They're animals.<br> You don't say. Put it in.<br> That's for you.<br> Call it a handling charge.<br> Tell Chicago I took it.<br> But if I read about this in the papers,<br> if I read about the savings of farmers...<br> ...being wiped out by a heartless<br> bank robber, I won't be happy.<br> Good afternoon.<br> You really trust me not to say<br> anything?<br> Always trust a bank manager.<br> There's no rush.<br> -Coffee?<br> -Thank you.<br> So, what brings you guys<br> to the middle of nowhere?<br> We're bank robbers.<br> We're just passing through.<br> So when do I get my share<br> of the money?<br> Well, how much do you want?<br> Two hundred dollars.<br> Okay. Deal.<br> -Could I have had more?<br> -You'll never know.<br> Come on, come on.<br> How much did they take?<br> How much?<br> Okay, answer me this:<br> What are we paying you for?<br> -Where's my father?<br> -What's this?<br> Why is no one talking to me?<br> I feel like a fucking prisoner.<br> I told you. You are not a prisoner.<br> You are being protected.<br> -This is what your father wants.<br> -I can look after myself.<br> No, you can't. This is the point.<br> You're a big baby who doesn't know<br> his thumb from his dick.<br> Fuck you.<br> The only reason you're still alive<br> is because you're John Rooney's son.<br> You're being a little<br> shortsighted here, Frank.<br> My father is an old man.<br> I am the future.<br> So don't you ever talk to me<br> that way again.<br> Maguire, do what you have to.<br> Find them.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan,<br> there is no money.<br> No... I can get you money, I just...<br> It won't be Chicago's.<br> They took it all out two days ago.<br> -Who authorized it?<br> -The accountant.<br> What's his name?<br> This is Mr. Rance in the bridal suite.<br> Before you proffer your congratulations,<br> there's no Mrs. Rance with me...<br> ...and I'm all the better for it.<br> Listen carefully...<br> ...because I am in no mood.<br> I'm going to say this only once.<br> I would like a boiled egg,<br> and I want it runny.<br> Pa, can we sleep in a motel room<br> tonight instead of the car?<br> Yeah, that would be nice.<br> How many more days<br> you gonna want me, mister?<br> Can't we close the curtains,<br> even for a little while?<br> I can't get no sleep<br> with all that light.<br> You see anything,<br> you hit that horn twice.<br> Don't get out of the car,<br> no matter what.<br> Bye.<br> -Ready?<br> -I'm ready.<br> Yes, sir. Right away, sir.<br> Runny.<br> It's open.<br> Top marks for speed,<br> no marks for cookery.<br> What, may I ask, do you call this?<br> Put it down.<br> -Mr. Sullivan.<br> -Mr. Rance.<br> How did you find me?<br> This is the best hotel in the area.<br> And you are so very particular.<br> Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.<br> May I ask you to lower your weapon.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, what do you want?<br> Information.<br> I can't give you the files.<br> All right, all right.<br> They're in the next room.<br> -In here.<br> -Bring it in.<br> I can't see.<br> What will you accomplish by<br> interfering with our business?<br> -This has nothing to do with business.<br> -It's all business. You fail to grasp that.<br> And in business, you must<br> have something to trade.<br> And you, Mr. Sullivan,<br> have nothing to trade.<br> Especially not for anyone<br> as valuable as Connor Rooney.<br> I don't understand.<br> Opening bell on Wall Street.<br> Come on, open it.<br> Which one is it?<br> No, no, not it.<br> Tried that one already.<br> Better start over.<br> You got one more try.<br> There it is.<br> I'm okay. Watch the road!<br> Pa! Pa, are you okay?<br> Pa!<br> Pa!<br> Help!<br> Help us!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Help us!<br> When are you two heading out?<br> We've stayed long enough.<br> We don't wanna cause you any trouble.<br> No trouble so far.<br> He's a good worker.<br> You have any kids?<br> No.<br> We met too late.<br> He dotes on you.<br> You don't see it.<br> Hello.<br> I had a bad dream.<br> You wanna talk about it?<br> Well, come on in. Take a seat...<br> ...if you want.<br> Math, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> I always hated it.<br> Me too.<br> So, what do you like?<br> Huh?<br> What subjects do you like...?<br> Did you like in school?<br> Bible history, maybe.<br> Why?<br> I like the stories.<br> Peter was good at math.<br> Was he?<br> Did you like Peter more than me?<br> No.<br> No, Michael.<br> I loved you both the same.<br> But you were...<br> You were different with me.<br> Was I?<br> Well...<br> Maybe it was because Peter was just<br> such a sweet boy, you know?<br> And you...<br> You were more like me.<br> And I didn't want you to be.<br> I didn't mean to be...<br> ...different.<br> Okay.<br> Good night, Pa.<br> Good night.<br> Michael, wake up.<br> Get your things.<br> We're leaving.<br> We left you something.<br> Hello, John.<br> You're a smart man, Michael.<br> I wanna talk.<br> Here?<br> Downstairs.<br> I didn't think I'd see you again.<br> Read this.<br> Connor's been stealing from you<br> for years.<br> He keeps accounts open under the names<br> of dead men. Men like the McGoverns.<br> I stood there and helped him<br> kill Finn to line his own pockets.<br> I thought I was working for you,<br> but I wasn't.<br> You think I'd give up my son?<br> He was betraying you.<br> I know.<br> Now, listen to me.<br> I tried to avoid more bloodshed.<br> You wouldn't accept that...<br> ...so I did what was necessary.<br> But I've always loved you like a son.<br> And now I'm telling you,<br> leave before it's too late.<br> Think.<br> Think.<br> They're protecting him now, but when<br> you're gone, they won't need him.<br> -This ends with Connor dead regardless.<br> -That may be...<br> ...but you are asking me...<br> ...to give you the key to his room<br> so you can walk in...<br> ...put a gun to his head<br> and pull the trigger. I can't do that.<br> -He murdered Annie and Peter.<br> -There are only murderers in this room.<br> Michael, open your eyes.<br> This is the life we chose,<br> the life we lead.<br> And there is only one guarantee:<br> None of us will see heaven.<br> Michael could.<br> Then do everything that you can<br> to see that that happens.<br> Leave.<br> I'm begging you.<br> It's the only way.<br> And if I go?<br> Then...<br> ...I will mourn...<br> ...the son I lost.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> Just one last thing,<br> and then it's done.<br> Go back to bed, Michael.<br> I'm glad it's you.<br> I'm glad it's you.<br> I understand.<br> But then Al wants your assurance<br> that after that, it's over.<br> The Lexington Hotel, room 1432.<br> Is that the house?<br> That's it.<br> I knew there was a dog.<br> Sarah? It's me, Mike.<br> We're here.<br> Smile.<br> Give me the gun.<br> Michael.<br> Michael...<br> ...don't you do this.<br> Give me the gun, Michael.<br> Come on.<br> Give me the gun.<br> I couldn't do it.<br> I know.<br> -Pa.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Pa.<br> Pa!<br> Pa!<br> Pa!<br> Pa! Pa!<br> I saw then<br> that my father's only fear...<br> ...was that his son<br> would follow the same road.<br> And that was the last time<br> I ever held a gun.<br> People always thought<br> I grew up on a farm.<br> And I guess, in a way, I did.<br> But I lived a lifetime before that...<br> ...in those six weeks on the road...<br> ...in the winter of 1931.<br> When people ask me if Michael Sullivan<br> was a good man...<br> ...or if there was just no good<br> in him at all...<br> ...I always give the same answer.<br> I just tell them:<br> "He was my father."<br>
