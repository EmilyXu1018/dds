                        I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D<br> How long?<br> A day, maybe two.<br> They're gone, Rob, and the beasts sold.<br> There's a wee glen|on the other side of Ben Duh.<br> If I were tinkers|with a two-day start,<br> I'd lie there and kill me some meat.<br> We'd not get there before dark.<br> Not stood here, we won't.<br> You can smell them through the meat.<br> Aye, if they fought|as strong as they smelled,<br> we'd be in trouble.<br> They're there right enough,|just like you said, Rob.<br> We can rush them when they're asleep.<br> Nine. One of them's a woman.<br> Half of them would be dead|before they were awake.<br> How will we take them, Rob?<br> I'll talk to them in the morning.<br> I'm getting too old for this...|lying wet arsed in the heather,<br> chasing other men's cattle.<br> Come away|to the Americas with me.<br> They say there's fine acres|for the clearing in Virginia.<br> Aye, and they'll likely be|as hard as these to sleep on.<br> Why are you going in|to talk to them?<br> I know one of them.<br> Up!<br> Get up, you bunch of ragged-arsed|tinker cow thieves!<br> This is Robert Roy McGregor|come to reclaim the 32 beasts<br> stolen from His Lordship James Graham,<br> ...Marquis of Montrose.<br> Tam Sibbald.<br> Still at your thieving.<br> Throw down now,|and I'll spare you, all but one.<br> There's a price to being|a leader of men, Tam.<br> By God, McGregor,|if there's any killing to be done,<br> you're the first.<br> Who do you think you are,|acting the great chief?<br> And I know you're a bigger thief|than any of us.<br> Aye, but if I had stolen|His Lordship's cattle,<br> you would not have|walked into my dreams so easy.<br> I can call the Gregorach|and kill the half of ya,<br> or it can be between us|and nothing more.<br> - Ha!|- Think on it, man.<br> Would you not rather|be dead after a good hump<br> And a belly full of stolen beef<br> or have me march you|back to Montrose<br> to shit yourself|on the gallows a month hence?<br> Throw down! Now!<br> And you have my word|no-one else will die!<br> Come, lads.<br> Any man with a blade in his hands,<br> cut him down.<br> Are ye men,<br> or what are ye?<br> He killed Tam,|and you stand and live!<br> And him as much an outlaw|as any of you!<br> No man among ya!|Your mothers curse you!<br> You're spittle!<br> You're leavings!<br> Listen to me well,|and remember this:<br> Or I'm going to remember you,|every last one.<br> When next you think to steal cattle,<br> have a care they're not|under my protection.<br> But if they are,|you're not stealing from their owners.<br> You're stealing from me,|Robert Roy McGregor.<br> No man who steals my beasts|makes a profit.<br> If you doubt me, ask Tam Sibbald.<br> What will you do with her?<br> Be on your way and tell no man|you fared ill at our hands.<br> Go on.<br> Cut him down!<br> Go on.<br> Yeah!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,|the winner of the contest is Guthrie!<br> Montrose, come hotfoot|from the court to the cockpit.<br> May I present Archibald Cunningham.<br> His Grace, the Duke of Argyll.<br> I am Your Grace's humble servant.<br> Another of your likely lads?<br> Archibald is sent me by his mother<br> in the hope that our climate|might cool the fever in his blood.<br> So, Mr Cunningham,<br> what are these principal sins|that distress your mother?<br> Dice? Drink?<br> Or are you a buggerer of boys?<br> It is years, Your Grace,|since I buggered a boy.<br> And in my own defence,|I thought him a girl<br> at the moment of entry.<br> What say you, Guthrie,<br> that Archie|could not tell arse from quim?<br> Many Englishmen|have that same difficulty.<br> Oh, spoken as well as you fought.<br> Did you see Guthrie here at work,|Mr Cunningham?<br> He has a fair hand with the cleaver.<br> You do not think much|of our highland tools, then?<br> If I had to kill an ox, a claymore|would be my first choice, Your Grace.<br> You best use a musket<br> and save the beast a slow dying.<br> I would not need|a musket for "you", Guthrie.<br> Oh, splendid!<br> I'll wager 100 of what you like<br> on Guthrie and his cleaver.<br> At odds?<br> Now, come, James,|you're a fox. What odds?<br> - Three?|- Two.<br> English pounds.<br> There's more of a jingle to guineas.<br> - Ah, guineas it is.|- Excellent, excellent.<br> A bumper of rhenish|for my Lord Montrose<br> And show Mr Cunningham|what blades we have.<br> You honour me, sir,|to serve me with your own hand.<br> I tell you, James,<br> I forget how much you dislike me|until I'm in your presence.<br> So, what news at Court?<br> What else but the succession?<br> Our poor Queen cannot find|the time to die in peace.<br> I fear she may pass over|and leave the matter unresolved.<br> Would that she had seen a child live|to comfort the kingdom.<br> One might have hoped that|a field so often ploughed<br> Might have yielded one good crop.<br> In truth, I have seen|healthier graveyards<br> Than that woman's womb.<br> Come on!<br> I am asked on what side|Your Grace will declare himself.<br> Where Argyll goes,|the path must be firm and broad.<br> And now all watch|to see which way to jump.<br> One cannot go to the closet<br> but what some adherent to James|is praising your pish.<br> I confess to a certain|weariness in this whole issue<br> and look to Your Grace|to give some lead.<br> All I could answer in honesty<br> was that it would be the one|most inclined to his own benefit.<br> Damn it, man. You talk too much.<br> Can you not tend to your wager?<br> Argyll, my wager is well won.<br> Damn it, Guthrie!<br> Is it not enough that you're beaten|but you must turn backstabber?<br> My factor will call upon|Your Grace's factor.<br> Welcome back.<br> Well done, Rob, man.<br> Cut out another of the cattle.<br> If the tinkers ate one,|they could have eaten two.<br> Montrose will charge you, nonetheless.<br> I'm weary of seeing|children hungry and old folk cold.<br> It'll take more than a cow to fix that.<br> You'll be in the Americas,|living off the fat,<br> so it won't worry ya.<br> - Have some broth, Rob.|- No, Coll. I'm for home.<br> God bless you, Rob.<br> Rob just walks in among them,|his sword still in its sheath<br> and says,|"Get up, you bunch of ragged-arsed..."<br> Hello, Rob.<br> "Get up, you bunch|of ragged-arsed cow thieves."<br> Rob up to him and says,<br> "Tell your crew to lay down|and I'll only cut your throat,<br> else I'll call my men."<br> And we're all there. We are ready.<br> Get up, boy. Come on.<br> Go on. Get.<br> I dreamed a silkie came.<br> And what did he do|to you, your silkie?<br> You wakened me|before the best of it,<br> but he would have|ravished me for certain.<br> How do you know you're awake, wife?<br> Mr Killearn.<br> I'm on my way.<br> Aye. Well on the way, I'd venture.<br> Let me be, Mr Killearn. You'll wake him.<br> Don't, Mr Killearn!<br> I'm sure the young master|has you nicely greased, does he not?<br> Oh, Betty, you'd hardly|feel me going in.<br> A wee whiff of quim in the morning,<br> Mr Cunningham, sir.<br> Just the thing to clear your head.<br> Mr Cunningham,|I hope I'm not disturbing you.<br> Of course|you're bloody well disturbing me.<br> Do you think I want to wake up<br> and find some great smelly|Scotch man staring down at me?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I came to tell you|that some local trades people<br> are pressing|for payment on your debt.<br> You woke me for that?<br> A thousand apologies, Mr Cunningham,<br> but they've also writ to His Lordship.<br> Damn it, man.<br> I but recently|earned His Lordship 200 guineas.<br> What are the complaints|of a few tradesmen for such services?<br> This country does not agree with me.<br> I cannot wait to be|out of the damnable place.<br> The sentiments of|a great many of us, sir.<br> Would you like me|to take away your chamber pot?<br> I know many a Scotsman would be|glad of this on a cold morning.<br> It's almost pure spirit,<br> and I'm no judge of a pint of pish.<br> Come back.<br> Come here!<br> I killed Tam Sibbald|yesterday morning.<br> We played ball once at Creiff market.<br> I remember shouting,|"Well done, Tam",<br> when he made a run.<br> And there he was,|hung on the end of my dirk like meat.<br> Aye.<br> Well, likely it was necessary.<br> Aye, it was.|Necessary enough to save worse.<br> But those tinkers|weren't all born broken men, Mary.<br> Some of them had kin and clan.<br> They made me fear|I might have come across<br> one of our own among them.<br> McGregors are not tinkers.<br> But a hard winter or two away,|some of us...<br> What's gnawing on you, Robert?<br> I've made up my mind|to borrow money from Montrose<br> to buy cattle at Creiff market|and sell at Carlisle.<br> How much money?<br> 1,000.<br> Believe me, Mary, it will turn profit.<br> 6 in Creiff is 12 in Carlisle.<br> And I know cattle.<br> I can drive them faster|and deliver them fatter<br> than any man in the kingdom.<br> Why would the Marquis of Montrose|lend a McGregor 1,000?<br> For profit, what else?<br> It's an investment as much as a loan.<br> So it's business partners you are now,|you and the Marquis.<br> Keep that tongue for your boys, woman.<br> I didn't tell you my mind|to be flayed for it.<br> You know I love the bones of you,|Robert McGregor.<br> But you take too much to heart|that cannot be helped.<br> It must be helped.<br> All right,<br> but not today.<br> I got yous.<br> I got the two of yous!<br> Got the two of yous!<br> Move on.<br> Father,<br> will McGregors ever be kings again?<br> All men with honour are kings,<br> but not all kings have honour.<br> What is honour?<br> Honour is<br> what no man can give you<br> and none can take away.<br> Honour is a man's gift to himself.<br> Do women have it?<br> Women are the heart of honour,<br> and we cherish|and protect it in them.<br> You must never mistreat|a woman or malign a man,<br> nor stand by and see another do so.<br> How do you know if you have it?<br> Never worry on the getting of it.<br> It grows in you and speaks to you.<br> All you need do is listen.<br> All right, lads,|enough of the finer things.<br> You've animals to tend to|and water to haul.<br> Your mother and me|will be down directly.<br> Take the basket.<br> Come on!|I'll race you down the hill.<br> Do you know how fine|you are to me, Mary McGregor?<br> So fine.<br> Is that why you sent them away?<br> To tell me how fine I am?<br> Or did you want to make a silk purse<br> out of my sow's ear again?<br> Tsk, tsk, tsk.<br> What a wanton I'm wed to.<br> You know what the old wives say<br> about these standing stones?<br> No. What do the old wives say... old wife?<br> Ow!<br> Ow. Come here.<br> What do they say?<br> So, what do they say?<br> They say the stones make men hard<br> and women fertile.<br> We've no need of them, you and me.<br> You know how fine you are to me,|Robert McGregor?<br> This tailor in Glasgow|to whom you owe 87<br> extended this credit|because you were my guest?<br> Or as you prefer to frame it,<br> a member of my household.<br> I can assure Your Lordship<br> I have in no manner indebted him.<br> And now Killearn tells me<br> that you are saddling|one of my serving wenches.<br> Damn it, sir! Your mother|did not send you to me<br> to debauch innocent girls.<br> I regret that I have|so offended Your Lordship.<br> By your leave, I will remove myself.<br> And to where,<br> might I ask?<br> You are penniless. You have no mount.<br> You know no-one.<br> To where would you remove yourself?<br> Have you some notion<br> of presenting yourself|at the Duke of Argyll's door<br> and soliciting his patronage|as his new champion?<br> I am Your Lordship's to command.<br> Remember your place, sir!<br> That's all I ask of any man.<br> What is next?<br> McGregor, My Lord.<br> You may go, Archibald.<br> You bear no arms?<br> I hadn't planned|on demanding terms at sword point.<br> Robert McGregor of Craigrostan,|My Lord.<br> So, McGregor...<br> I knew your father,|an able man, if not a wise one.<br> Have you taken on his mantle?<br> As best I may, My Lord.<br> So, how many men are you master of?<br> Master of none, My Lord,<br> but some 200 souls|live close by Craigrostan,<br> and they're in my care.<br> You are a profit and provider to them,<br> is that not so?<br> What I can, I do.<br> It is no great matter|compared to Your Lordship's work.<br> To know one's place, McGregor,<br> in the order of things|is a great blessing.<br> What terms, Killearn?<br> A fifth, My Lord.<br> A fifth, you say?<br> What, is this man kin|that you offer such kindly terms?<br> Am I not accustomed|to a quarter on unsecured loans?<br> McGregor has 300 acres|at Craigrostan, My Lord.<br> Ah. A man of property|intent on growing richer.<br> Well, we have more in common|than I would have suspected, McGregor.<br> 1,000 for 3 months, you say,<br> and these acres of yours as security?<br> And my oath.<br> Ah, yes.<br> Tell me, is there something|in what Killearn says<br> that you might have driven off my cattle<br> and returned them with stories of tinkers|caught and summarily executed?<br> I have, in my day, thieved cattle,<br> but none that were under my watch.<br> Is that what passes for honour<br> with a McGregor?<br> What passes for honour with me<br> is likely enough|the same as with Your Lordship.<br> When my word is given,<br> it is good.<br> Well, you are to be congratulated<br> on such cheaply bought nobility.<br> Killearn will draw papers.<br> I will expect the terms to be met.<br> My thanks to Your Lordship.<br> Aye, but it's a fine,|bold signature you have,<br> worthy of a chieftain himself.<br> Are you Rob Roy McGregor?<br> I am. And what's your name?<br> Davey Anderson.<br> Hello, Davey Anderson.<br> Hello.<br> Even the servant boys|know who you are.<br> You've become a famous reiver|and retriever in your own lifetime.<br> Business and profit.<br> And a soft winter.<br> Are you Rob Roy McGregor?<br> I am.<br> I'm Will Guthrie.<br> You heard of me?<br> No, I have not.<br> Well, I've heard of you.<br> Indeed.<br> And what have you heard, Mr Guthrie?<br> I heard you backstabbed Tam Sibbald.<br> Were you and Tam kin?<br> Near enough.<br> I shagged his sister.<br> Likely so did Tam.<br> You want the wind|let out of your bladder?<br> What's your business with me, Guthrie?<br> Business best done outside.<br> We have no quarrel.<br> That can be remedied.<br> The first cut?<br> Aye.<br> Well done.<br> Some other time<br> when we're both sober.<br> Tam Sibbald has a longer reach dead|than he ever did living.<br> I'm away home.<br> Keep the pony|and stick to Killearn till you have the note.<br> I'll see you back in Craigrostan.<br> I'm to wait here till the note is signed.<br> Aye. We are the obedient one.<br> Fetch and carry at command.<br> Why has a smart young lad like you<br> attached himself to a bunch of tinkers?<br> I would have thought you more fit<br> To serve a man like my master,|the Marquis of Montrose.<br> I do not serve Robert McGregor.<br> I'm his friend<br> and count myself fortunate to claim it.<br> My God, what a crew|you Highlanders are.<br> With your airs and honours,<br> come begging 1,000 as if you|were doing the lender a favour.<br> Sheep shaggers, the lot of ya.<br> Baa!<br> My mother could come no nearer<br> than three candidates for my paternity.<br> The Earl of Rutland.<br> Now, there's a name for a whore master.<br> A secretary to the Spanish Ambassador<br> whose name she hazarded as Ferdinando<br> and some young buck she never saw<br> who raised her skirts|at the masked ball.<br> He ravished her?!<br> I would put it no higher|than surprised.<br> Archie, take me with you.<br> Wherever.<br> Whatever.<br> Take me away with you.<br> I am away, Betty,<br> and God help me,|this is where I've landed.<br> You think me a gentleman<br> because I have linen|and can manage a "lisp".<br> I am but a bastard abroad,<br> seeking my fortune|and the favours of great men,<br> as big a whore as my mother ever was.<br> I'm pregnant by you, Archie.<br> Well.<br> When it asks for its father's name,<br> at least you'll have it to give.<br> Mr Cunningham, it's me... Killearn.<br> A word with you.<br> Don't let him see me.<br> You are a carbuncle|on this arse of a country.<br> And if you ever inform against me|to His Lordship again,<br> I'll squeeze the pus out of you<br> with my bare hands.<br> My, Archie,<br> but you have a rare contempt in you.<br> I gave you no leave|to call me familiar.<br> Could I pay for the privilege?<br> At a fair price.<br> What are you gibbering about?<br> Money, Archie. Money. What else?<br> How much money?<br> Let's talk inside over a dram.<br> It's chill on the stairs.<br> Say what you have to say.<br> I am engaged within.<br> Ah, you've Betty on her back.<br> How much money?<br> 1,000.<br> 1,000.|What does 1,000 look like?<br> Will we have enough ponies to carry it?<br> Not coin. A note of credit<br> drawn on His Lordship.<br> - What interest, Rob?|- One fifth.<br> And he gets 200 profit for three months?<br> Aye. That's the price of cash,<br> and we must plan the matter|to the last penny.<br> When Alan returns,|he'll take three of you,<br> and you'll go to Creiff.<br> There you'll bargain with the drovers<br> and have the herd assembled|when I come with our kit for the drive.<br> How big a herd?<br> And whatever we can acquire|along the way.<br> No harm if a dozen or more stick.<br> We'll drive them into Carlisle like an army.<br> So, let's have all hands to it.<br> We'll stay warm this winter,|within and without.<br> To celebrate, we'll hold a gathering<br> and drink to our success!<br> Right, McKinness.<br> That's two shillings still owing.<br> - Next.|- Colqhoun.<br> Colqhoun, what have you got? A rabbit?<br> You're still a week behind, Colqhoun.<br> Must I wait all day|for my note, Killearn?<br> Patience, McGregor's man.<br> Your turn is marked.<br> Take you that goat to the pen.<br> Come, young Davey Wilson.<br> What have you got for me?|Another rabbit.<br> - Does nobody have any money?|- No, sir. Only a rabbit.<br> Dreaming of the New World, were we?<br> I hear tell in the New World<br> they have tribes of noble savages<br> with paint on their faces<br> and skins on their backs.<br> You'll be well at home among them.<br> Enough of this tripe.|Have you the note?<br> His Lordship is to Edinburgh|for the Assize,<br> then to London direct.<br> Great doings at the Court.<br> And he's away without signing the note.<br> The best I can do for you is coin.<br> This was not agreed.<br> Agreed or no, there's 1,000 here.<br> Take it or leave it,|it makes no difference to me,<br> nor to His Grace.<br> Aye, it's a terrible shock,<br> the sight of such a fortune|within reach, is it not?<br> It's just as well you have|the trust of the McGregor<br> or I'd be hard pressed|to sign it over to you.<br> Angus.<br> A great gathering, Rob.<br> Oh. That Alasdair Roy|is a fierce dancer.<br> The last time|I saw you in such a lather,<br> - You were flat on your back.|- Ooh!<br> Do not affront me afore these folk.<br> Rob, do you know why Calvinists|are against shagging standing up?<br> No, Coll. I do not.<br> They fear it might lead to dancing.<br> Stay back,<br> or by God, I'll shoot you dead.<br> For a moment there, I thought|you might take the road to Greenock<br> with your 1,000.<br> Killing is not so easy as it seems.<br> La.<br> He sat out there all day,|pondering on this.<br> - You gave him coin.|- He insisted upon it.<br> When I told him His Grace|hadn't signed the note,<br> he said you must have it,<br> or the beasts could not|be bought at the best price.<br> I'm hard put to see you|hand over such a sum<br> to one who couldn't bear the debt.<br> He was your man,<br> present at your signing of the terms,<br> ordered by you to wait.<br> For a note, not a bag of guineas!<br> It was not all guineas.<br> These farmers pay in small coin,|I assure you.<br> He signed for this bag of coin?<br> Indeed.<br> He did.<br> Almost as bold a hand as yourself.<br> There best be no skulduggery here,|Killearn.<br> Alan McDonald|stands under my protection.<br> Well, that's a great comfort|to us all, I must say,<br> what with 1,000 at risk.<br> Now, listen. We must search for Alan.<br> I fear he's come to mischief hereabouts.<br> I say we look in Greenock.<br> It comes quickly to your mind|that he has robbed us.<br> He spoke of the Americas often enough.<br> And he walked|to Greenock from Buchlyvie<br> and sent his pony home without him?<br> 1,000 would be enough|to buy him 10 ponies.<br> Alan McDonald did not betray me.<br> Now to it and find his trace.<br> Come on! To it!<br> Go to Greenock, then<br> since you have that stink in your nose.<br> But, brother,<br> bad enough that it might be so|without you wishing it.<br> Rob.<br> Well, what news?<br> The ship sailed|the day before I got there,<br> and McDonald's name<br> was not on the harbourmaster's list.<br> But he wouldn't have|likely used his own name<br> and him run off with... 1,000...<br> Aye.<br> Your Lordship,<br> the Duke of Argyll this way comes.<br> John, you look like a man|who means to play hard.<br> Do not presume to speak|above your station, sir!<br> I will have my rank from you!<br> Your Grace.<br> I have word from Court|that you're saying I'm a Jacobite,<br> as one who would rise for the Stuart|should he land here to claim the throne.<br> Great men such as yourself<br> draw rumours as shite draws flies.<br> You are the shite, Montrose,<br> and the flies upon it!<br> For all the flowers|in your great gardens,<br> I know you in my nose.<br> Keep your stink off my name,<br> or by God, I will clip you|as close as one of your gelded trees,<br> and this carrion you keep|will not come between us!<br> What pride to use|a fellow peer in public so!<br> Damn his pride!<br> Forgive me.<br> Damn His Grace's pride.<br> Why is it so beyond your belief<br> that he might have yielded|to the sight of all that money?<br> Unguarded, unasked, but there<br> a lifetime's wages in a bag.<br> Because I know him.|I know him more than half his life.<br> But was he ever handed 1,000 before?<br> He was handed a hundred times more.<br> He was given trust, and he repaid in kind.<br> Why do you not believe me?<br> All right, Rob.<br> He did not steal from you.<br> But he has gone, the money's gone,<br> and Montrose will not care|if you believe one thing or the other.<br> - That's another matter.|- No. That's the only matter now.<br> For all our sakes, Robert,|you must take off your high hat,<br> and make what terms you can.<br> Else our home is lost|and ourselves His Lordship's tenants.<br> Ah, here comes the bold Highlander.<br> No arse in his breeks<br> but too proud to tug his forelock.<br> No doubt the rogue seeks|to blame his servant<br> for I hear there|is no word of the man.<br> I see you're back in favour|with your tailor, Archibald.<br> He must be a happy man.<br> So, McGregor, how is it with you?<br> As it was, My Lord.<br> There is still no word of McDonald|or Your Lordship's money.<br> What are we to do, then?<br> If Your Lordship would contract with me|for another sum,<br> I would turn over|all profit and so repay my debt.<br> I have but lost 1,000.|You ask me to risk another?<br> My Lord, the money was stolen from me|and from you.<br> I am no part of your incompetence.<br> You signed a paper.<br> And I will honour it.<br> Oh, ply me not with your honour, man.<br> Let us keep these matters simple.<br> You are indebted to me.|On that we are agreed?<br> We are, My Lord.<br> Know you the Duke of Argyll?<br> By his repute alone.<br> My report is that Argyll is a Jacobite<br> and would declare for James Stuart|should he seek to reclaim the throne.<br> These are intelligences|unknown to me, My Lord.<br> They are known to you now.<br> I'm uncertain of Your Lordship's meaning.<br> Oh, damn it, man!<br> You and your clan are Jacobites<br> bred to the bone.<br> Argyll is nothing to you.<br> I want your word against him.<br> Give it, and we will come|to some reckoning on what you owe me.<br> I can be of no assistance|to Your Lordship<br> in this matter of the Duke of Argyll.<br> You owe me.<br> I owe you money. Nothing more.<br> What you have asked is as below me|as it should be beneath Your Lordship.<br> You misspeak yourself, McGregor.<br> It is the Marquis of Montrose|who has misspoke himself<br> to ask my perjury against his enemies.<br> Leave the blade be, sir!<br> This is not your quarrel.<br> You do not hear me, McGregor.<br> I did not ask if or whether.<br> Your land is forfeit to me|against your debt.<br> Until that is settled,|I will have you lodged in the tolbooth.<br> Take him into custody, Archibald.<br> You have my commission on it!<br> My father spent two years in that jail<br> for no cause but the will|of great men like you.<br> - I will "not" go there, sir.|- Call out the watch!<br> Call nothing, or I'll cut his throat!<br> You are damned, McGregor.<br> Damned to hell.<br> Come, Your Lordship.<br> Leave the devil some work.<br> You've done enough for one day.<br> Call out the watch!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Call out the watch!|Call out the watch!<br> You have slept your last|peaceful night, McGregor.<br> You and yours.<br> What is John Campbell,|Duke of Argyll, to us<br> that you must defend him|against Montrose?<br> I did not defend him.<br> I refused to bear|false witness against him.<br> Gregor, send men to the passes|and set watches.<br> And the lochside?<br> They'll not likely come by|the shore, but watch all ways.<br> Listen, lads. I have to go|to the hills for a time.<br> You stay by your mother|and be her help, you hear?<br> Let Argyll know|that you are persecuted for his sake.<br> I'm persecuted|for no man's sake but my own, Mary.<br> What?<br> Would you have me lie|against my conscience to suit Montrose?<br> No! To suit me and Duncan and Ranald,<br> to stay home with your wife|and children<br> instead of taking to the hills like a fox.<br> Out!<br> Out! Out! Out! Out!<br> He'll be with you soon enough!<br> Take the boys and go to Morag's.<br> She'll make a place.<br> And let Montrose's|troopers foul my house.<br> No harm will come to you.|Montrose's quarrel is with me.<br> And you revel in it.<br> The great man against all.<br> And likely you'll slip|down in the night<br> when the mood takes you.<br> Or will you just|find yourself a sheep to comfort you?<br> If I do, it will be one|that doesn't bleat so bitter.<br> No trouble between them and you.<br> Give no cause.<br> This is between me and Montrose,<br> and likely when he's broke a few horses,|he'll quieten down.<br> Watch Alasdair.|Put him where he can do no harm.<br> Keep up the watch for McDonald.<br> Ach, Rob, he's long gone.<br> Aye, but is he over the seas|or under them?<br> And, Coll, ask Morag to go down to Mary.<br> She's sore at me for this business.<br> That Montrose is a stoat of a man.<br> Heaven protect us from his like.<br> When the King comes|across the water again,<br> we'll see him hung.<br> Your Lordship will not regret|leaving this matter in my hands.<br> I have some knowledge of how best|to bring such rogues to heel.<br> Broken but not dead, Archibald.|That is all I ask.<br> Broken but not dead.<br> It has a ring to it.<br> Your health.<br> Goodbye!<br> Instead of spying them out,|we should lay for them<br> and cut them down|as they come through the passes.<br> Aye, a wee war with Montrose|would suit us fine.<br> Listen, Alasdair Roy.<br> Keep your watch, give warning,|and stay your hand,<br> or you'll answer to me.<br> Damn that McDonald|has brought this on us.<br> I never trusted the man.<br> Always at Rob's arse like a collie dog.<br> Morag had a dream on him.|Saw him drowned.<br> Maybe his ship sank<br> and him loaded down with the theft.<br> Wheesht! "Wheesht!"<br> Give me your musket.<br> Boys, wake up! Wake up!|Quickly! Quickly!<br> Get out of bed!<br> Go, go!
