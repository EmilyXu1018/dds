Come here!<br> You stink up the neighborhood!<br> - You know, you can...<br> - Hey!<br> When I was your age,<br> there was only one girl in the<br> whole neighborhood talked like that.<br> That was it. Just one.<br> What are you doing?<br> It'll make your teeth yellow.<br> Don't do that.<br> - I like yellow teeth.<br> - It'll make your breath like garbage.<br> - Maybe I like garbage.<br> - Come on, nobody likes garbage.<br> Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...<br> she wasn't bad-lookin',<br> but, you see, none of the guys<br> ever took her seriously, see.<br> They never took her out<br> for any serious datin'.<br> - Why?<br> - 'Cause that's the way guys are.<br> They laugh when you talk dirty,<br> they think you're cute,<br> but after a while, you get<br> a reputation, that's it.<br> You get no respect,<br> you understand?<br> You get no respect.<br> And I gotta use a bad word.<br> Whore.<br> You understand? Whore.<br> See, you use dirty words<br> and maybe you end up becoming<br> a whore, you understand?<br> Come on, Rocky.<br> I'm just 12.<br> Hey, that don't matter<br> that you're 12. It don't matter.<br> You don't really have to be one.<br> You just act like one... that's it. Boom.<br> Hey, if you get a bad rap,<br> you understand?<br> Twenty years from now,<br> people are gonna say,<br> "Hey, you remember Marie?"<br> "No, who's she?"<br> "She's the little whore that hung out<br> at the Atomic Hoagie Shop. "<br> "Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,<br> now I remember her. "<br> You see, they don't remember you,<br> they remember the rep.<br> You understand?<br> Hey, you got a boyfriend?<br> No, you ain't got a boyfriend.<br> You know why? Why don't you<br> think you have a boyfriend?<br> 'Cause you're hangin' out with them<br> coconuts in the corner, understand?<br> You hang around coconuts,<br> you get nowhere.<br> They're lemons.<br> Lemons.<br> You hang out with nice people,<br> you get nice friends, you understand?<br> You hang out with smart people,<br> you get smart friends.<br> You hang out with yo-yo people,<br> you get yo-yo friends.<br> You see?<br> It's simple mathematics.<br> - I hope you ain't...<br> - I won't.<br> What was I gonna say?<br> You hope I don't keep acting like<br> a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?<br> - Yeah, something like that.<br> - Good night, Rocky.<br> Good night, Marie.<br> Take care, you know?<br> - Hey, Rocky?<br> - Yo.<br> Screw you, creep-o!<br> Yeah, who are you<br> to give advice, creep-o? Huh?<br> Who are you?<br> - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br> - Definitely.<br> It says here Mac Lee Green<br> has suffered a severely cracked<br> third metacarpal in his left hand.<br> Damn.<br> Of course, we can<br> cancel the fight indefinitely<br> if you're set on fighting Green.<br> Hey, it ain't just Green!<br> What about all the time<br> Apollo has invested?<br> I believe<br> we can find a solution.<br> Solution nothin'. You better find me<br> another ranked contender.<br> And I mean in a flash, Jergens.<br> Don't play games with my client.<br> Apollo's already done<br> a million dollars worth of publicity,<br> has made contractual obligations<br> with 20 different organizations...<br> he's not going<br> to be embarrassed!<br> I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.<br> Ernie's fighting in France<br> that same week.<br> Then get me Buddy Shaw!<br> Hell, he's ranked fifth!<br> Went to California<br> and gained 50 pounds.<br> I get a hold of every<br> worthwhile contender<br> and they all say the same thing...<br> five weeks just isn't enough time<br> to get into shape.<br> Shape nothin', man!<br> They're afraid.<br> They know everybody in the world's<br> gonna see this fight,<br> and none of them's<br> got a prayer of whippin' me.<br> They're makin' excuses<br> so they don't have to be the chump<br> to get whipped in front<br> of the whole civilized world.<br> All I can say<br> is I'm a good promoter.<br> I've promoted fights<br> in every goddamn country in the world,<br> and I've broken my ass over this one.<br> But I don't know<br> what the hell else to do!<br> I do.<br> Without a ranked contender,<br> what this fight is gonna need<br> is a novelty.<br> This is the land<br> of opportunity, right?<br> So Apollo Creed,<br> on January 1st,<br> gives a local underdog fighter<br> an opportunity.<br> A snow-white underdog,<br> and I'm gonna put his face<br> on this poster with me.<br> And I'll tell you why.<br> Because I'm sentimental.<br> And a lot of other people<br> in this country are just as sentimental,<br> and there's nothing they'd like better<br> than to see Apollo Creed<br> give a local Philadelphia boy<br> a shot at the greatest title in the world<br> on this country's biggest birthday.<br> Now, that's the way I see it.<br> And that's the way it's gonna be.<br> Apollo, I like it.<br> It's very American.<br> No, Jergens.<br> It's very smart.<br> Okay, I'll see you later, man.<br> - What? What is it?<br> - I just wanna check this thing out.<br> Now, you said pick up<br> two yards from Snyder<br> and a grand from Cappoli, right?<br> No, no. No, no. Two yards<br> from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.<br> - Two yards. Two yards.<br> - Write it down, okay?<br> Yeah, I got it. Got it.<br> Who's this girl you're going<br> out with tomorrow night?<br> How'd you know?<br> You know.<br> Don't you think I hear things?<br> A lot of canaries<br> flying around the docks.<br> - I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br> - Hey, Rocky.<br> - What?<br> - I hear she's retarded.<br> She ain't retarded.<br> She's shy, you know?<br> I'll tell you what to do.<br> Take her to the zoo.<br> I hear retards like the zoo.<br> - This bum gotta say that?<br> - Who're you calling a bum?<br> - I'm calling you a bum!<br> - Okay, relax. Relax.<br> Buddy's in a bad mood.<br> It's his prostate.<br> He's always in a bad mood.<br> You know, you oughta count<br> your blessings, Buddy.<br> You're still a healthy person,<br> you know that?<br> - I don't like your face.<br> - I don't like yours, either!<br> - Kiss my ass!<br> - Move your shoulders down!<br> - Get out of the car!<br> - Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.<br> What, are you driving me crazy?<br> Both of yous.<br> - Buddy doesn't like you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Some guys, they just hate<br> for no reason, capisce?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Come here.<br> There's 50 bucks. You and your girl<br> Adrian have a nice time, you hear?<br> Thanks.<br> Hey, how'd you know her name?<br> You don't think I hear things?<br> - Hey, Rock.<br> - What?<br> - Remember what I told you.<br> - What'd you tell me?<br> Take her to the zoo.<br> - Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br> - No, thanks, Shirley.<br> What do you think<br> about Billy Snow?<br> Fouls.<br> How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Nah. He's too old and dull.<br> Hey, Bobby Judd.<br> He's a good boy.<br> No, I don't feel any heat<br> from that name.<br> Joe Zach's a good prospect.<br> Exactly what are<br> you looking for, Apollo?<br> This is what I'm looking for.<br> The Italian Stallion.<br> Rocky Balboa?<br> Never heard of him.<br> Look, it's the name, man.<br> The Italian Stallion.<br> The media will eat it up.<br> Now, who discovered America?<br> An Italian, right?<br> What would be better than to get it on<br> with one of his descendents?<br> He's a southpaw.<br> I don't want you messing around<br> with southpaws.<br> - They do everything backwards.<br> - Southpaw nothin'.<br> I'll drop him in three.<br> Apollo Creed<br> meets the Italian Stallion.<br> Sounds like a damn monster movie.<br> Hey, what are you doing<br> with that bat, huh?<br> I used to be deadly at stickball.<br> You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?<br> She's very excited.<br> - Look at my swollen hands.<br> - Yeah.<br> The joints from walkin' and<br> carryin' meat in and out of freezers.<br> It plays hell on the joints.<br> Maybe you oughta see a doctor.<br> What do you think?<br> I don't need a doctor.<br> I need a different job.<br> Different job. What kind of turkey?<br> Big turkey or small turkey?<br> Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him<br> I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.<br> I'd make a great collector.<br> Bustin' bones don't bother me.<br> Don't bother you.<br> A big turkey, right? Huh?<br> Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.<br> It's a bad job, you know what I mean?<br> - You got a match?<br> - Go to him for me. As a favor.<br> Yeah. Yeah. You know,<br> the last time I had a turkey<br> was when they<br> were having a $2 special<br> at Horn and Hardog's<br> about three years ago.<br> Last year me and the turtles<br> had spam. What do you think?<br> Yeah, that sounds<br> like a good idea.<br> Your sister knows<br> I'm coming for sure, right?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> She's very excited.<br> I'm all alone<br> Hey, will you forget<br> about Gazzo, huh?<br> - I don't ask nobody twice.<br> - I don't ask nobody twice.<br> Stay away, baby<br> Hey, your sister... you sure<br> your sister knows I'm comin'?<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> She's very excited.<br> Yeah?<br> Paulie? You're late.<br> Called the hospital? She calls<br> the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.<br> How you doin'?<br> I told you she's very excited.<br> Paulie, why didn't you tell me<br> you were bringing him here?<br> Look at me.<br> I'm not ready for this.<br> Would it make a difference<br> if you were?<br> He's a friend,<br> and now he's taking you out.<br> No, I can't.<br> You're in the kitchen,<br> and I want you out right now.<br> Hey.<br> Hey!<br> Hey, I want you<br> outta here instamatically!<br> I'm sick of seein' you hanging around<br> like a freakin' spider!<br> Go out! Live!<br> Enjoy life!<br> Paulie, I can't go!<br> Don't get wise with me,<br> now, huh?<br> - I'm tired of you being a loser.<br> - Don't call me that, Paulie!<br> Apollo Creed says he'll<br> be shopping for another victim<br> to fill Green's vacancy for<br> the bicentennial championship fight.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> you were bringing him home?<br> - How do you know I didn't?<br> - I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!<br> - I won't go!<br> - Why?!<br> Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.<br> I got a turkey in the oven.<br> Oh. A turkey in the oven?<br> A turkey in the oven.<br> You want the bird?<br> Go in the alley<br> and eat the bird.<br> Oh, Paulie.<br> I want you outta here!<br> Get outta the house!<br> Go out and enjoy<br> your freakin' life!<br> You hungry, Rock?<br> Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just<br> better forget all this, you know?<br> - Just forget it.<br> - Forget nothin'.<br> Go ahead.<br> Tell her somethin' funny.<br> Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in<br> a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.<br> You know how to do funny.<br> You wanna go out with my sister?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well... come on.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Yo, Adrian,<br> it's me, Rocky.<br> Rocky, you know?<br> Listen, uh...<br> I don't know what to say,<br> 'cause I ain't never talked<br> to no door before, you know?<br> I mean, what do I say<br> to a door... hey, listen...<br> Come on.<br> You're doin' fine.<br> I ain't doin' fine.<br> I look like an idiot.<br> Keep doin' what you're doin'.<br> You're funny.<br> I know all about these things.<br> I feel like a jerk.<br> Yo, Adrian,<br> it's Rocky again, you know?<br> Listen, uh...<br> I know you ain't too happy<br> at this moment, you know,<br> but could you do me a favor?<br> I ain't got nobody to spend<br> Thanksgiving with, you know?<br> So, uh...<br> how 'bout maybe you and I maybe<br> go out together, get something to eat.<br> I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.<br> Who knows, you know?<br> Would you like to, uh...<br> I don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br> you know, you and me go out together?<br> What do you think?<br> Would you like to?<br> We're gonna have a good time.<br> We'll have a real good time.<br> Thanks for the bird.<br> I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br> I got a headache.<br> - What does your sister like to do?<br> - Ice skate.<br> Adrian, come on.<br> You're lettin' the heat out.<br> Who pays the bills around here?<br> Listen, I don't want<br> no turkey anyway, you know?<br> But it was Thanksgiving.<br> - It was what?<br> - It was Thanksgiving.<br> Yeah, to you.<br> But to me it's Thursday.<br> - It looks kinda quiet, you know?<br> - I think it's closed.<br> No, I think maybe we're just early<br> or something like that.<br> - Yo!<br> - Yo!<br> - We're closed.<br> - What?<br> I said we're closed.<br> Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna<br> smooth this guy out here.<br> So just wait here for a few minutes.<br> I'll be right back, okay?<br> - We could go someplace else.<br> - No, it's okay.<br> Hey, listen, are you closed<br> to the general public,<br> or are you closed to everybody...<br> you know what I mean?<br> Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.<br> That's why there's nobody here.<br> And besides, you ain't<br> supposed to be in here.<br> So do me a favor<br> and not stay here, huh?<br> - Would you do me a favor?<br> - Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.<br> Look... this girl here<br> ain't feelin' well, you know.<br> The doctors say she should go out<br> and exercise once in a while,<br> and ice skating's probably<br> the best thing, know what I mean?<br> So what do you want from me?<br> I want you to do me a favor.<br> You could see she ain't feelin' too good.<br> If you could let her on the ice,<br> I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.<br> Ten minutes, ten bucks.<br> Ten bucks? How 'bout eight...<br> eight bucks?<br> Come on. It's Thanksgiving.<br> All right, nine bucks,<br> you got a deal.<br> You have the ice to yourself.<br> Ten bucks.<br> Give her the blades.<br> Aren't you skating?<br> Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.<br> That's when I started fightin'...<br> when I was 15.<br> Skating's kinda bad<br> for the ankles, you know?<br> Yeah.<br> You're a pretty good skater,<br> are you?<br> You know, like I was saying before<br> on the way over here.<br> Fightin' used to be tops<br> with me, but no more, you know?<br> All I wanted to do at a fight<br> was prove I was no bum...<br> that I had the stuff<br> to make a good pro, you know?<br> You never got the chance?<br> Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I<br> still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.<br> I tell you what the trouble is...<br> I'm a southpaw.<br> - What's a southpaw?<br> - A southpaw means you're left-handed.<br> And a southpaw<br> throws your timing off, you see.<br> Other guys it throws their timing off,<br> makes them look awkward.<br> Nobody wants to look awkward.<br> - You know where southpaw came from?<br> - Nine minutes!<br> I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...<br> maybe a couple hundred years ago...<br> he was fightin' in the...<br> I think it was around Philadelphia...<br> and his arm... he was left-handed,<br> and his arm was facing towards<br> New Jersey, you see, and that's south.<br> So then that's why they<br> call 'em southpaw, you see?<br> Southpaw, South Jersey.<br> South Camden, southpaw.<br> You know what I mean?<br> I don't know. Things probably<br> worked out for the best, don't you think?<br> Never got a chance, though,<br> because you're left-handed, huh?<br> Well, that's absolutely true,<br> you know. Watch out.<br> I just dislocated my finger.<br> Look at that. No, wait.<br> Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.<br> See? Look, I had it...<br> it's an old wound, you see that?<br> Look. See?<br> Nothin'. It bends like that, see?<br> I originally done it...<br> look, push the button.<br> Bong. It works.<br> It ain't your fault.<br> - Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.<br> - Seven minutes!<br> Yeah, I originally done it.<br> I carry pictures of all my fights.<br> I originally done it<br> in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?<br> Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.<br> I broke both my hands on his face.<br> I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br> don't you think? See how it works there?<br> Real nice.<br> Come on.<br> You having a good time?<br> I'll tell you... you could see<br> I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.<br> But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you<br> know what I mean? I can really hit hard.<br> But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants<br> to fight no southpaw, know what mean?<br> Huh?<br> You know how I<br> got started in fightin'?<br> - Huh?<br> - No.<br> Am I talkin' too loud?<br> - No.<br> - Three minutes!<br> My father... he's, uh...<br> my old man, he was never too smart.<br> He says to me, "You weren't born<br> with much of a brain,<br> so you better start using<br> your body," right?<br> So I become a fighter.<br> Oh.<br> - You know what I mean?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why are you...<br> why are you laughin'?<br> My mother...<br> she said the opposite thing.<br> What'd she say?<br> What'd she say, the opposite?<br> She said you weren't born<br> with much of a body,<br> so you better develop your brain.<br> Did she say that?<br> Yo! Time!<br> Can I ask you a question?<br> Absolutely.<br> - Why do you wanna fight?<br> - 'Cause I can't sing or dance.<br> Eh, oh.<br> Don't fall! Don't fall!<br> Hey, that was terrific.<br> I'm pretty good at this.<br> You like the way I skate?<br> The last fight I had, I had<br> with this guy named Spider Rico.<br> He busted my head up.<br> You see that scar?<br> I'll tell ya...<br> things get pretty rough in the ring.<br> You know, with some people,<br> I'm very shy by nature, you know?<br> I suppose.<br> I say you're very shy<br> by nature, you know?<br> I suppose.<br> Ey! Ey.<br> The bum from the dark.<br> Get a job, you bum!<br> You know, some people think<br> that being shy is a disease,<br> but it don't bother me none.<br> It don't bother me, either.<br> Then why'd I bother<br> bringing it up, huh?<br> 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.<br> I think we make<br> a real sharp couple of coconuts.<br> I'm dumb, you're shy.<br> What do you think, huh?<br> I don't understand why anybody<br> would wanna be a fighter.<br> Hey, you gotta be a moron.<br> You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br> a fighter, you know what I mean?<br> It's a racket where you're<br> almost guaranteed to end up a bum.<br> - I don't think you're a bum.<br> - Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?<br> But I'll tell ya somethin'.<br> The worst thing about fightin'<br> is the mornin' after, you know?<br> - The mornin' after?<br> - I'll tell you. Yeah.<br> The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing<br> but a large wound, know what I mean?<br> Sometimes I got pains<br> all over me.<br> I feel like callin' a taxi to take me<br> from the bed into the bathroom.<br> Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,<br> your face is all busted up,<br> your hands are swollen, you know?<br> Look at this face.<br> See that nose?<br> That nose ain't never been broken.<br> I've had guys bustin' on it,<br> I had guys chewin' on it,<br> twistin' it, punchin' it...<br> I mean, whack! Boom!<br> These guys,<br> they hittin' my nose all the time.<br> Never broken. I'm very proud of that.<br> Isn't that rare? That's rare.<br> - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br> - Why do you think?<br> 'Cause... you can't sing and dance.<br> Yeah, somethin' like that.<br> Somethin' like that.<br> Hey, you wanna come inside?<br> No. I gotta go.<br> Hey, come on.<br> Hey, I got some animals.<br> I got these rare... very rare<br> animals inside. Come on. Come on in.<br> No, no. I gotta go.<br> Well, I gotta go, too.<br> I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.<br> Come on.<br> - No, I gotta go.<br> - Hey, look at this face.<br> Is that a face you could trust<br> or what? Huh? Is it?<br> They oughta stick this face<br> on a stamp.

Relax.<br> Do you have a phone?<br> No, I ain't got no phone.<br> I had it pulled 'cause of people<br> calling all the time, and, uh,<br> who needs the aggravation,<br> right? The interruptions.<br> Who'd you wanna call?<br> I wanna let my brother<br> know where I am.<br> Why?<br> I think he might be worried.<br> Well, I'll call your brother,<br> if that's the problem.<br> Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me!<br> I'll call yous back later!<br> See ya!<br> What's the matter?<br> You don't like the room, do ya.<br> It's fine.<br> Well, it's only temporary,<br> you know.<br> It's not that.<br> What's the problem?<br> You don't like me?<br> You don't like the turtles?<br> What's the problem?<br> - I don't think I belong here.<br> - It's okay.<br> I don't belong here.<br> Well, you know, it's okay,<br> 'cause you're my guest.<br> I don't...<br> know you well enough.<br> I've never been<br> in a man's apartment alone.<br> Well, I...<br> they're all the same.

You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.<br> Mr. Jergens is expecting you.<br> Just a moment.<br> Mr. Rocky Balboa<br> to see you, sir.<br> Fine.<br> - Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br> - Can I have that?<br> Oh, certainly.<br> Thanks.<br> Mr. Balboa.<br> How are you?<br> George Jergens.<br> Take a chair, please.<br> Thanks.<br> Mr. Balboa.<br> - Call me Rocky.<br> - Rocky.<br> Tell me, Rocky,<br> you got any representation?<br> You have a manager?<br> - No. It's just me.<br> - Oh.<br> Rocky, I've got a proposition<br> I'd like to make to you.<br> - Uh, sparrin'?<br> - Beg your pardon?<br> Well, it's just I know<br> you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,<br> and I just wanna say<br> I'm very available, you know.<br> I'm sure you are.<br> Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ<br> would be an honor.<br> - And you know what, Mr. Jergens?<br> - What?<br> I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.<br> I'd really be a good sparring partner.<br> You don't understand me, Rocky.<br> My proposition is this...<br> Would you be interested<br> in fighting Apollo Creed<br> for the World<br> Heavyweight Championship?<br> No.<br> Listen, Rocky...<br> Apollo's seen you fight.<br> He likes you.<br> He wants to fight you.<br> Well, it's just that, you see, uh...<br> I fight in clubs, you know.<br> I'm really a ham-and-egger.<br> This guy... he's the best, and, uh,<br> it wouldn't be such a good fight.<br> But thank you very much,<br> you know.<br> I appreciate it and all that.<br> Rocky? Do you believe that America<br> is the land of opportunity?<br> Yeah.<br> Apollo Creed does.<br> And he's gonna prove it<br> to the whole world<br> by giving an unknown<br> a shot at the title.<br> And that unknown is you.<br> He picked you, Rocky.<br> Rocky, it's the chance<br> of a lifetime.<br> You can't pass it by.<br> What do you say?<br> All right, fellas, fellas.<br> That's enough pictures.<br> We wanna ask Apollo<br> a few questions.<br> Apollo, how do you like<br> the city of brotherly love?<br> Well, just being in Philadelphia<br> makes me feel patriotic.<br> Beautiful people in a beautiful city<br> comin' up to me on the street<br> wishing me the best.<br> I love my Philadelphia brothers,<br> and I'm proud to be an American.<br> Champ, Apollo,<br> why did you agree to fight a man<br> who has virtually<br> no chance of winning?<br> Look, if history proves one thing,<br> American history proves<br> that everybody's got a chance to win.<br> Didn't you guys ever hear<br> of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?<br> - Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.<br> - Yes?<br> It is a coincidence<br> that you're fighting a white man<br> on the most celebrated day<br> in the country's history?<br> I don't know about that.<br> Is it a coincidence<br> that he's fighting a black man<br> on the most celebrated day<br> in the country's history?<br> Right on!<br> Tell the truth, brother!<br> Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you<br> feel about your challenger?<br> - How do I feel about him?<br> - Yeah.<br> What do you mean?<br> Come here, Rock.<br> My main man,<br> Rocky, ain't you Italian?<br> Yeah, I'm Italian.<br> Well, now, what does that mean?<br> It means if he can't fight,<br> I bet he can cook.<br> All right, Rocky.<br> Do me a favor.<br> His lungs... punch 'em out.<br> Paulie.<br> But, Rocky, how do you expect<br> to fight Apollo Creed?<br> Uh, well, geez, you know.<br> Creed's the best.<br> I guess I'll have to do<br> the best I can.<br> Tell me, Rocky,<br> just between us...<br> where did you get the name<br> "Italian Stallion"?<br> Oh... uh, I invented that<br> about eight years ago<br> when I was eatin' dinner.<br> Rocky, now your payday<br> will be $150.000.<br> Any comment?<br> You... you got no comment,<br> Rocky, right? No comment.<br> Right.<br> Thank you, Rocky.<br> Wait a minute. I just wanna<br> say hi to my girlfriend, okay?<br> - I, uh...<br> - Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.<br> Look at this. Can you believe<br> all this? They put a microphone on me.<br> - You didn't.<br> - Thank you, Rocky.<br> - Quit pushin', man!<br> - Thank you, Rocky.<br> Don't it matter he's makin' you<br> out a fool? I'd break his lips.<br> - He's taking cheap shots.<br> - It don't bother me none.<br> Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking<br> for people to help you out.<br> - Help in what?<br> - Keep you livin' the clean life.<br> I'll do okay. You know.<br> You need someone to help<br> with the exercise,<br> and someone standing by with a towel,<br> or runnin' errands. You know.<br> Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared<br> about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.<br> So I just think I'm<br> gonna train myself, you know.<br> Without such good people<br> around to help,<br> you don't have<br> such a good chance.<br> Einstein flunked out of school twice.<br> That so?<br> Yeah.<br> Beethoven was deaf.<br> Helen Keller was blind.<br> I think Rocky's<br> got a good chance.<br> Want me to get you<br> a beer, Paulie?<br> Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?<br> Keep out of my freakin' life!<br> - What'd I do?<br> - Nothin'.<br> - What? Did I say something wrong?<br> - You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.<br> That's right... you didn't say nothin'!<br> Nothin' at all!<br> - I gotta go.<br> - Oh.<br> Where's the freakin' pretzels?!<br> I got the pretzels!<br> Hey! We ain't got any beer?<br> I thought you were supposed<br> to pick up some beer.<br> How'd you like hearing<br> your name on TV tonight?<br> I was shocked.<br> Why'd you do that?<br> Come on.<br> You're puttin' me on, right?<br> Absolutely.<br> What time should I expect you?<br> Oh, about 7:00.<br> Hey.<br> Hey...<br> You know how I said that stuff<br> on TV didn't bother me none?<br> Yeah.<br> It did.<br> Listen, the reason I brought you here<br> is because, uh...<br> I wanna know if you got any money<br> for training expenses, eh?<br> I got a few dollars.<br> A few bucks? Well, here.<br> Put this in your glove.<br> - What's this?<br> - 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.<br> You know, you ain't never<br> had any luck,<br> but I think this time Lady Luck may be<br> in your corner. What do you think?<br> Maybe. Maybe.<br> Hey, thanks for the money,<br> Tony, you know.<br> It's okay. Don't worry about it.<br> See ya, all right?<br> - Hey, wait a minute.<br> - What?<br> You're in training, huh?<br> Come on.<br> Hey.<br> - Yo, Tony.<br> - What?<br> You gonna show up at the fight?<br> Ringside.<br> Hey, ey.<br> I'll see ya.<br> Yeah?<br> Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br> Can I come in?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> - Yeah, good.<br> Hey, it's a nice place here.<br> All right, anyway,<br> what I come to tell you is that, uh...<br> that what happened to you<br> is freak luck.<br> - Yeah, freak luck.<br> - Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.<br> Now, they're good fighters, right?<br> They're colorful, they got good records.<br> They fight their guts out<br> for peanuts.<br> But you...<br> you get a shot at the title.<br> Freak luck is a strange thing.<br> Yeah, sure it is.<br> Can I sit down?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> What the hell are those?<br> Oh, those are domestic turtles.<br> The one on the top is Cuff<br> and the other guy's Link.<br> The rest of them are marbles.<br> Yeah? They make good soup,<br> don't they?<br> Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya<br> that you gotta be very careful<br> about this shot<br> that you got at the title,<br> because, I don't know,<br> like the Bible says...<br> you ain't gonna get<br> a second chance.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> You thought of that, huh?<br> Well, what you need<br> is a manager.<br> A manager.<br> Listen to me.<br> I know because I've been<br> in this racket for 50 years.<br> - 50 years, huh?<br> - 50 years.<br> God, I've seen it all.<br> All of it.<br> - You know what I done?<br> - What?<br> I have done it all.<br> You shoulda seen me when I<br> knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.<br> Outta the goddamn ring.<br> That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.<br> And it was the same night that Firpo<br> knocks Dempsey outta the ring.<br> The same night. So, who gets<br> the publicity? Figure that out.<br> - Dempsey.<br> - That's right. But why?<br> - 'Cause he was Champ.<br> - No! Because he had a manager.<br> I had nothin', man.<br> I wanna show you somethin'.<br> Look at my face for a minute.<br> Look at this.<br> I got 21 stitches over this left eye.<br> I got 34 stitches over this eye.<br> You know what?<br> I had my nose busted 17 times.<br> The last time was<br> with that fight with Sailor Mike.<br> I got that clip in here.<br> That was a good fight.<br> You wanna read that?<br> You... oh, it doesn't matter.<br> Anyway, he put this vegetation<br> on my ear.<br> Ah, Rocky Marciano.<br> You know, you kinda remind me<br> of the Rock, you know that?<br> You really think so?<br> That's right. You move like him,<br> and you got heart like he did.<br> Yeah, I got heart,<br> but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?<br> Uh... anyway,<br> you know, when I begun<br> in this business, kid...<br> Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.<br> Don't drink that piss before a fight.<br> You know, it's no good for you.<br> If you don't mind my sayin'.<br> Anyway, you know,<br> when I started this racket,<br> pugs like us,<br> we was treated like dogs.<br> For ten bucks,<br> you gotta tear somebody's throat out.<br> But I never had no management.<br> You know...<br> One time,<br> this... this son of a bitch that I fought,<br> he put a nail right there.<br> - Thumb.<br> - The thumb, yeah. In the glove.<br> And he punched<br> so many holes in my face.<br> I had the spit<br> shootin' out of my cheeks.<br> Can you imagine that?<br> Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like<br> when I was, uh, in my prime.<br> I want you to look at some...<br> will you look at that? Look at that.<br> That's the way I looked...<br> before these guys got at me.<br> That's nice. You take very<br> good care of the picture, though.<br> But I never had...<br> I never had no management...<br> that's the trouble!<br> But now I got all this knowledge.<br> I got it up here.<br> Now I wanna give it to you!<br> I wanna give you this knowledge.<br> I wanna take care of you.<br> I wanna make sure that all this shit that<br> happened to me doesn't happen to you.<br> You know what I mean?<br> The fight's set.<br> Listen to me.<br> I wanna be your manager.<br> - You follow that, do you?<br> - The fight's set. I don't need a manager.<br> But you can't buy<br> what I'm gonna give you.<br> I mean, I've got pain<br> and I've got experience.<br> Well, I got pain<br> and I got experience, too.<br> Listen, kid...<br> - Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.<br> - What?<br> I needed your help about<br> ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?<br> - Right.<br> - You never helped me. You didn't care.<br> Well, if you wanted help...<br> I say, if you wanted help,<br> why didn't you ask?<br> Why didn't you<br> just ask me, kid?<br> Look, I asked,<br> but you never heard nothin'!<br> Well, I...<br> I, uh...<br> I know I...<br> I'm 76 years old.<br> And, uh... well.<br> Where the hell is...<br> Took you long enough to get here.<br> Took you ten years<br> to come to my house?<br> Huh, what's the matter?<br> You don't like my house?<br> Does my house stink?<br> That's right... it stinks!<br> I didn't have no favors from you!<br> Don't slum around me!<br> Talkin' about your prime.<br> What about my prime, Mick?!<br> At least you had a prime!<br> I didn't have no prime.<br> I didn't have nothin'!<br> Leg's are goin', everything is goin',<br> Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.<br> Guy comes up, offers me a fight.<br> Big deal.<br> Wanna fight the fight?<br> Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.<br> I wouldn't wanna fight.

Very...<br> Well, the thing is,<br> I got vinyl seats in my car.<br> When I hit the seats this morning,<br> I just went. "Whew!"<br> I'm thinkin', if I'm up,<br> everybody in the Delaware Valley<br> should be up. Do you agree with me?<br> I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,<br> what else are you gonna do?<br> - Hello?<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.<br> This is Don Cannon,<br> W- I-B-G Philadelphia.<br> - How are you this morning?<br> - Huh?<br> - Mrs. Kramer?<br> - What?!<br> I think you have a lot of nerve calling me<br> at this hour in the morning!

Boom.<br> What is the matter with you, Paulie?<br> This was supposed to be private.<br> - I'm doin' you a favor!<br> - You ain't doin' me no favors!<br> You're embarrassin' me<br> in front of everybody,<br> you make me look bad<br> in front of your sister...<br> You see this cigar? I'll stick it<br> in your ear. Don't do these things to me!<br> You should've called me up<br> or something... leave a message.<br> Don't do that!<br> My sister really likes you.<br> I'm gonna kill you one of these days,<br> I swear to God!<br> Come on. Come on.<br> - Baby!<br> - Baby.<br> Here he is, the next<br> heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!<br> Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.<br> Listen, we wanna get a brief interview<br> with you. It won't take long.<br> - What about me?<br> - What about you?<br> - I'm in charge of the meat.<br> - Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?<br> Listen, just settle yourself in.<br> Just relax.<br> What we're going to do is<br> just ask you a few questions, Rocky.<br> Just a few questions<br> about your unique training method.<br> Talk to the folks at home.<br> They really wanna know<br> how you got into this.<br> I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.<br> Jimmy, you guys ready?<br> Let's roll.<br> Rocky, why don't you turn<br> right around here.<br> Just don't take no cheap shots,<br> you know?<br> No, I won't do that.<br> Just relax, Rocky.<br> Today we're here with<br> heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.<br> - The reason we're standing...<br> - The meat guy's stickin' his face in.<br> Let's try it again, Rocky.<br> Today we're here with<br> heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.<br> The reason we're standing<br> in this refrigerated box<br> is that Mr. Balboa has<br> an unusual method of training.<br> In a moment,<br> he's going to demonstrate that<br> for the viewing audience at home.<br> But first, Rocky, how did you<br> come to train in an icebox?<br> Uh, well, my friend...<br> the guy over there...<br> let me in one day and I hit<br> the beef here and kinda liked it.<br> And since I become a challenger,<br> the owner don't mind that I come in.<br> Is this a common training method?<br> Do other fighters pound raw meat?<br> No, I think I invented it.<br> Don't forget to confirm the reservation<br> for my people at ringside,<br> and be sure<br> to fly my barber to Philly.<br> How much is being channeled into<br> West Coast closed circuit advertising?<br> - $300,000.<br> - Make it 450.<br> And send the mayor's wife<br> and make sure we get a picture<br> of it for all the newspapers.<br> Do you wanna run<br> the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?<br> I think you could spend your money<br> better in Canadian publicity.<br> By the way... I've got<br> a couple of friends up in Toronto<br> who'd probably be able<br> to get you a good tax break.<br> George, I like your friends.<br> Hey, Champ...<br> you oughta come look at this boy<br> you're gonna fight on TV.<br> Looks like he means business.<br> Yeah, I mean business, too.<br> Shirley, we got<br> any more coffee out there?<br> Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.<br> I'll get you some right away.<br> After the fight, I may just retire<br> and run for emperor.<br> The arena's<br> the only program concession,<br> and the gross rental of the arena<br> is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?<br> Diana Lewis, in the meat house<br> with southpaw Rocky Balboa.<br> And he called the reporters?<br> Yeah, it threw<br> my whole training schedule off.<br> Don't be mad at him.<br> He's just trying to help.<br> Adrian, I ain't mad,<br> it's just that, uh,<br> when a reporter's around,<br> I get out of joint<br> 'cause they take cheap shots,<br> and Paulie knows that.<br> Paulie keeps askin' me<br> for a job all the time,<br> but he don't know nothin'<br> about fightin'.<br> Are you gonna say<br> anything to him?<br> What's to say?

"<br> I noticed a buzzing<br> in the background now, Bill.<br> Could be the challengers<br> getting ready to get into the ring.<br> Rocky! Look at my date.<br> Cost me $200.<br> - 250.<br> - I gotta go. I gotta work.<br> - How's the robe?<br> - It's a little baggy.<br> A 50 to 1 underdog<br> living a Cinderella story,<br> and he's captured people's<br> imaginations all over the world.<br> We love you, Rocky!<br> - Good luck, champ.<br> - Hey, thanks for showin' up.<br> And his record... 44 victories.<br> He's got 38 by knockout,<br> and he's lost 20 fights.<br> Which makes me wonder,<br> can he stand it...<br> the stamina and the skill<br> to last the three rounds?<br> Because Las Vegas odds say no.<br> Rocky Balboa<br> climbing into the ring now.<br> The Italian Stallion.<br> Some meat sign<br> on the back of his robe there.<br> Have you seen what that was?<br> Shamrock Meats, Inc.<br> A lot of noise coming from the back.<br> You could go deaf with that noise.<br> You have the spotlights.<br> Is that the world<br> heavyweight champion Apollo Creed?<br> He's in a boat... riding in a boat.<br> Is he supposed<br> to be George Washington?<br> Obviously so. He's got the hat on,<br> the whole thing. Look at that.<br> It's been confirmed.<br> The world champion Apollo Creed<br> is doing an imitation<br> of George Washington.<br> - He's throwing money.<br> - I don't believe it.<br> Remember we were talking about<br> George Washington throwing the dollar?<br> Throwing the dollar.<br> 'Course, if you threw a dollar<br> in those days, it went a lot farther.<br> Oh, he's taking his...<br> White wig came off,<br> the hat came off.<br> And the crowd is loving<br> every minute of it... look at that.<br> Here is the world<br> heavyweight champion.<br> Apollo Creed...<br> for you around the world<br> he was dressed as George Washington,<br> the father of our country.<br> I want you!<br> Oh! Look at that!<br> Uncle Sam himself.<br> I want you!<br> All of you!<br> "All of you. " he's saying.<br> He looks like a big flag.<br> I want you.<br> You.<br> - Is he talkin' to me?<br> - He's talkin' to you.<br> - Is he talkin' to me?<br> - Let him talk while he can talk.<br> I want the Stallion!<br> He says, "I want the Stallion.<br> I want the Stallion. "<br> In foreign countries,<br> during WWI,<br> there was the picture of Uncle Sam<br> with his finger pointed like that.<br> A recruiting poster for our fellows<br> in the service... the Army and the Navy.<br> - "I want you. "<br> - That's what he's doing a take of.<br> - There he is.<br> - That's it, Creed.<br> Creed in three.<br> What do you think<br> that outfit cost?<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> Good evening.<br> A very happy New Year.<br> Welcome to Philadelphia.<br> Well, everybody who's anybody<br> is here tonight.<br> Time...<br> Time does not permit me to introduce<br> the many luminaries of politics,<br> show business, and the sporting world<br> who are with us tonight.<br> But I would like to present<br> one of the immortals of pugilism,<br> a champion<br> in and out of the ring,<br> Philadelphia's own Smoking Joe,<br> the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!<br> How you doin'?<br> Don't hurt him, okay?<br> Go light on him.<br> Come on, now.<br> ...he's been in his career<br> as a fighter.<br> Now he's coming over<br> to talk to the Champ.<br> - Hey, how 'bout that?<br> - Hey, Joe.<br> - You've been ducking me long time.<br> - No, Joe. You're next, Joe.<br> - I want you, you understand?<br> - You're next, Joe!<br> They must be friends.<br> Joe Frazier!<br> The fight is on the way. Settle down<br> because it won't be long now.<br> And now...<br> for the main event.<br> The challenger,<br> white trunks,<br> weighing 190 pounds,<br> Philadelphia's favorite son,<br> The Italian Stallion,<br> Rocky Balboa.<br> And on my right,<br> wearing red, white and blue,<br> weighing 210 pounds,<br> undefeated in 46 fights,<br> the master of disaster,<br> the undisputed,<br> heavyweight champion of the world<br> Apollo Creed.<br> I want you and you.<br> You. You.<br> You, chump.<br> I want you!<br> You boys both fought in Philadelphia<br> before, and you know the rules.<br> No low blows,<br> watch your heads, no butting.<br> Shake hands now<br> and come out fightin'.<br> Put your hands up there, chump.<br> - Come out fightin'.<br> - Come on. Come on.<br> Rocky's takin' it carefully.<br> He's just going over and being calm,<br> it looks like from here.<br> There goes the big hat.<br> I've never seen a fighter<br> that concerned about his hair.<br> And there's the bell<br> for round one.<br> The fighters come into the center<br> of the ring, looking at each other.<br> Rocky just looking.<br> The Champion gives one<br> of the left-handed jabs right there.<br> The Champ's stinging,<br> the slower challenger jabs at will.<br> In fact, it just looks like Rocky's<br> blocking the blows with his face.<br> The Champion doesn't look<br> the best he's ever been,<br> but he's really moving now.<br> Well, the Champion<br> is smiling now.<br> He's toying with this man.<br> Trying to give the fans<br> their money's worth.<br> He's very clearly outdoing<br> the challenger right now.<br> I'll get you. Come on.<br> He's just trying to make this man<br> make him... see! Make him miss like that.<br> Oh, the Champ<br> is just taunting him now.<br> He's dancing around.<br> I don't believe it!<br> - The Champ is down.<br> - Yes, he is!<br> Creed is down!<br> What a surprise this is!<br> This is the first time the Champion<br> has ever been knocked down.<br> Six... seven... eight.<br> Appears to be all right.<br> A little glassy-eyed, but okay.<br> Let's go to work right now, Rock!<br> Come on!<br> Now Rocky coming back out,<br> and he's like a bull in a china closet.<br> He really wants it.<br> Boy, the Champion's<br> coming back.<br> He's coming off the floor now,<br> and he's trying...<br> A left, a right, another left,<br> another right, combination!<br> Into the face!<br> And that's the Apollo we know.<br> Now he's taunting him.<br> He's taunting Rocky.<br> "Come on, let's go. "<br> Left. There's another left.<br> Another left.<br> There!<br> Left and right.<br> Rocky's got him on the rope!<br> Come on.<br> Okay, break.<br> Punch. Hit me. Hit me.<br> I tell you, there's no way we expected<br> this kind of hitting from him.<br> Oh, no way,<br> but with the ability of the Champion...<br> Apollo unloading a left, really<br> trying to get him up against the ropes.<br> They're leading him over to his corner.<br> Rocky can hardly find his way.<br> He's sitting down now.<br> I told ya! I told ya!<br> Your nose is broke.<br> - How's it look?<br> - Ah, it's an improvement.<br> I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.<br> I want you to stick and move.<br> Go for the ribs.<br> Don't let that bastard breathe.<br> The guy's great.<br> He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br> He thinks it's a damn fight.<br> Finish this bum and let's go home.<br> Stay to the body. The body!<br> You're doing great!<br> Creed got knocked down<br> at the end of the first.<br> He came back strong at the end<br> of the first, but he's working hard.<br> A smart left.<br> Another left and a right.<br> And now coming<br> into the corner again.<br> Oh, Balboa's taking<br> a tremendous beating here.<br> Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?<br> Stop clownin' around here<br> and give these people something to see.<br> He says he wants him!<br> If you folks aren't aware... you're<br> watching a battle... I tell you that.<br> Balboa trying to fight back.<br> Oh! He tagged the Champ<br> with a tremendous hook!<br> The Champion is trying<br> to get himself out of there,<br> but he just can't do it.<br> He is being barraged with lefts<br> and rights to the head, to the body.<br> Balboa is smacking the Champion<br> right on the kisser.<br> And the referee's... they're ready<br> to keep going. Look at that!<br> - Back to your corner.<br> - Put that chump back in his corner.<br> - Come on, Creed.<br> - Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.<br> This is gonna be a tough one.<br> Now he's got him. A left.<br> A hard left<br> and a right combination.<br> What is keeping him up, Bill?<br> I don't know.<br> He can't even get his gloves up<br> to protect himself.<br> He needs to stop, Bill.<br> Down! Down!<br> Stay down!<br> Apollo dancing around<br> with his arms in the air.<br> ...five... six...<br> seven... eight... nine...<br> Apollo can't believe it.<br> The Champion got a left<br> to the ribs... his right rib.<br> Oh, this has been<br> a tremendous...<br> - Okay, Champ?<br> - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.<br> It hurts, though.<br> He broke my rib.<br> I can't see nothin'.<br> You gotta open my eye.<br> - Cut me, Mick.<br> - I don't wanna do it!<br> Go on, cut me.<br> Cut me.<br> Try it.<br> Oh, God.<br> You're bleeding inside, Champ.<br> I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?<br> You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.<br> You ain't stoppin' nothin'.<br> - You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.<br> - All right.<br> - Go if you wanna go.<br> - I'm goin'.<br> You gotta go.<br> You gotta give it all. Give it all!<br> You gotta get him.<br> You gotta work on that body.<br> The crowd is on fire.<br> The 15th and final round.<br> They look like they've been<br> in a war... these two.<br> Oh, the Champion<br> really tagged him!<br> And Apollo clearly protecting<br> his right side... his ribs.<br> Hard left and right!<br> - Look at the blood coming from his face.<br> - Oh, he's spitting up blood now.<br> A tremendous right hand by Rocky.<br> Go for it! Go for it, Rock!<br> Listen to this crowd!<br> Oh! Another to the rib.<br> That left hand again right to the chin!<br> Oh! He's got him<br> up against the ropes!<br> Apollo the Champ.<br> Ain't gonna be no rematch.<br> Ain't gonna be no rematch.<br> Don't want one.<br> Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.<br> How do you feel?<br> I feel all right.<br> What were you thinking about<br> when that buzzer sounded?<br> Adrian!<br> What? Adrian!<br> Rocky?<br> Rocky?<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> your attention, please...<br> Rocky?<br> Rocky!<br> You've had the privilege<br> of witnessing the greatest exhibition<br> of guts and stamina<br> in the history of the ring.<br> Adrian!<br> Rocky!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> we have a split decision.<br> Adrian!<br> Rocky!<br> ...for Creed.<br> - No plans out there for a rematch?<br> - Ain't gonna be a rematch.<br> Oh, come on.<br> I don't know yet, okay?<br> You heard him, ladies and...<br> Rocko! That's my friend. Rocko!<br> - Hey, you're breakin' the jacket.<br> - Let's go, Buddy. Come on.<br> Paulie?<br> - Adrian? Adrian!<br> - Rocky!<br> Adrian!<br> Hey, where's your hat?<br> I love you.<br> - I love you!<br> - I love you.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br>
