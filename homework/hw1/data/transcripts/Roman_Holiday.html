Well, it was|a kind of a gray.<br> I think I know the dress you mean.|It has a gold collar.<br> That's the one. I didn't know exactly|how to describe it, but that's it.<br> I think you described it|very well...<br> in view of the fact that Her Highness|was taken violently ill at 3:00 a.m. ...<br> put to bed with a high fever...<br> and has had all her appointments|for today cancelled in toto!<br> In toto?<br> Yes, Mr. Bradley.<br> In toto.<br> That's certainly|pretty hard to swallow.<br> In view of the fact|that you just left her, of course.<br> But here it is, all over the front page|of every newspaper in Rome.<br> All right, all right, I overslept.|It could happen to anybody.<br> If you ever got up early enough|to read a morning paper...<br> you might discover|little news events...<br> little items|of general interest...<br> that might prevent you in the future|from getting immersed...<br> in such a gold-plated, triple-decked,|star-spangled lie as you just told me.<br> If I were you, I'd try some other line|of business, like mattress testing.<br> Is this the princess?<br> Yes, Mr. Bradley,|that is the princess.<br> It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour|or Madame Chiang Kai-shek.<br> Take a good look at her. You might be|interviewing her again someday.<br> Am I fired?<br> No, you're not fired.<br> When I want to fire you,|you won't have to ask.<br> You'll know you're fired.<br> The man's mad.<br> Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.<br> Now listen carefully.<br> I want you to hurry up to my place and|see if there's somebody there asleep.<br> "S", Mr. Joe.<br> I look... "subito".<br> You wait... "aspetta".<br> Mr. Joe?<br> Yeah... Yeah, yeah.|Tell me, tell me.<br> Giovanni, I love you.|Now, listen...<br> Yes, Mr. Joe.<br> A gun?<br> No!<br> Yes, a gun, a knife, anything!<br> But nobody goes in,|and nobody goes out.<br> Okay.<br> You still here?<br> How much would a real interview|with this dame be worth?<br> You mean Her Highness?<br> I don't mean Annie Oakley,|Dorothy Lamour or Madame... How much?<br> What do you care?|You got as much chance...<br> I know, but if I did,|how much would it be worth?<br> Oh, just a plain talk on|world conditions might be worth 250.<br> Her views on clothes, of course, would|be worth a lot more. Maybe a thousand.<br> - Dollars?|- Dollars.<br> I'm talking about her views|on everything.<br> The private and secret longings...<br> of a princess.<br> Her innermost thoughts, as revealed|to your Rome correspondent...<br> in a private, personal...<br> exclusive...<br> interview.<br> Can't use it, huh?<br> I didn't think you'd like it.<br> Come here.<br> Love angle too, I suppose.<br> Practically all love angle.<br> With pictures.<br> Could be. How much?<br> That particular story would be worth|five grand to any news service.<br> But tell me, Mr. Bradley,|if you are sober...<br> just how you are going to obtain|this fantastic interview.<br> I plan to enter her sick room|disguised as a thermometer.<br> You said five grand?|I want you to shake on that.<br> You realize Her Highness is in bed today|and leaves for Athens tomorrow.<br> I'd like to make|a little side bet with you.<br> Five hundred says|you don't come up with the story.<br> - What are you looking at that for?|- I just want to see what time it is.<br> What day it is.<br> - It's a deal.|- Now I'd like you to shake.<br> You're into me|for about 500 now.<br> When you lose this bet,|you'll owe me a thousand.<br> Why, you poor sucker.|I'll practically own you.<br> You have practically owned me for|a couple of years, but that's all over.<br> I'm gonna win that money, and I'm gonna|buy a one-way ticket back to New York.<br> Go on.|I love to hear you whine.<br> And when I'm back in a real newsroom,|I'll enjoy thinking about you...<br> sitting here with an empty leash in|your hands and nobody to twitch for you.<br> So long, pigeon.<br> - Everything okay, Giovanni?|- "S", Signore Joe.<br> Nobody she's come,|nobody she's go.<br> - Absolutely nobody.|- Swell.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> How would you like|to make some money?<br> That's the stuff.<br> I've got a sure thing.<br> Double your money back|in two days.<br> Double my money?<br> Well, I need a little|investment capital to swing the deal.<br> Now, if you'll just|lend me a little cash...<br> You...<br> owing me two months rent.<br> And you want me|to lend you money?<br> Tomorrow you'll be sorry.<br> Your Highness?<br> Your Royal Highness?<br> Yes?

Let's go.|Look out!<br> I'll park at the corner.<br> What do they mean,|all these inscriptions?<br> Well, each one represents|a wish fulfilled.<br> It all started during the war when|there was an air raid right out here.<br> A man with his four children|was caught in the street.<br> They ran over against the wall|right there for shelter...<br> and prayed for safety.<br> Bombs fell very close,|but no one was hurt.<br> Later on, the man came back and|he put up the first of these tablets.<br> Since then,|it's become sort of a shrine.<br> People come, and whenever|their wishes are granted...<br> they put up another one|of these little plaques.<br> Lovely story.<br> Read some of the inscriptions.<br> Make a wish?<br> Tell the doctor?<br> Anyway, the chances of it|being granted are very slight.<br> Well, what now?<br> I've heard of a wonderful place|for dancing on a boat.<br> - The barges down by Sant'Angelo.|- Yes.
