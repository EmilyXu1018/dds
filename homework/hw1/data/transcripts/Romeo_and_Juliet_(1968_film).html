                        Two households, both alike in dignity,<br> in fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br> from ancient grudge<br> break to new mutiny,<br> where civil blood makes<br> civil hands unclean.<br> From forth the fatal loins<br> of these two foes<br> a pair of star-crossed lovers<br> take their life,<br> whose misadventured<br> piteous overthrows<br> do with their death,<br> bury their parents' strife.<br> The quarrel is between our masters<br> and us their men.<br> 'Tis all one.<br> Here come the house of the Montagues.<br> - Good morrow.<br> - Good morrow to you, sir.<br> Quarrel, I will back thee.<br> Right. Fear me not.<br> Come. Let's on.<br> Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br> I do bite my thumb, sir.<br> Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br> Look at them.<br> No, sir, I do not bite my thumb<br> at you, sir,<br> but I do bite my thumb, sir.<br> Do you quarrel, sir?<br> - Quarrel, sir? No, sir.<br> - If you do, sir, I am for you.<br> - I serve as good a man as you.<br> - No better?<br> Yes, better, sir.<br> You lie.<br> Draw! Draw, if you be men!<br> Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.<br> Part, fools! Put up your swords.<br> You know not what you do.<br> The Prince hath forbid<br> this bandying in Verona streets.<br> Here come the Capulets!<br> Tybalt. Capulet's kinsman.<br> What, art thou drawn<br> among these heartless hinds?<br> Turn thee, Benvolio,<br> look upon thy death.<br> I do but keep the peace.<br> Put up thy sword or manage it<br> to part these men with me.<br> Drawn and talk of peace?<br> I hate the word, as I hate hell,<br> all Montagues and thee.<br> - Have at thee, coward!<br> - Capulets!<br> Montagues!<br> Now hie thee home, fragment!<br> Villain!<br> Give me my long sword! Capulets!<br> On to the market square!<br> Capulets!<br> Follow me! Follow me!<br> Kill the villain Montague!<br> My noble uncle!<br> What?<br> My sword! My sword!<br> Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.<br> Hold me not! Let me go!<br> Montague!<br> - Montague!<br> - Montague!<br> Kill the villain Capulet!<br> I'll strike thee, coward!<br> - The Prince is coming!<br> - Put down your weapons!<br> Here comes the Prince!<br> Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br> throw your mistempered<br> weapons to the ground...<br> Down with your weapons. Down, I say.<br> ...and hear the sentence<br> of your moved Prince.<br> Three civil brawls,<br> bred of an airy word by thee,<br> old Capulet,<br> and Montague,<br> have thrice disturbed<br> the quiet of our streets.<br> If ever you disturb our streets again,<br> your lives shall pay the forfeit<br> of the peace.<br> For this time, all the rest depart away.<br> You, Capulet, shall go along with me.<br> And, Montague,<br> come you this afternoon.<br> Once more, on pain of death,<br> all men depart!<br> Where is Romeo? Saw you him today?<br> Right glad I am he was not at this fray.<br> An hour before the worshipped sun<br> peered forth the golden window<br> of the east,<br> a troubled mind<br> drove me to walk abroad,<br> where underneath the grove<br> of sycamore did I see your son.<br> Towards him I made,<br> but he was ware of me<br> and stole into the cover of the wood.<br> Many a morning<br> hath he there been seen.<br> See, where he comes.<br> So please you, step aside.<br> I'll know his grievance<br> or be much denied.<br> I would thou wert so happy<br> by thy stay, to hear true shrift.<br> Come, madam, let's away.<br> Good morrow, cousin.<br> - Is the day so young?<br> - But new struck nine.<br> Ay me! Sad hours seem long.<br> Was that my father<br> that went hence so fast?<br> It was.<br> What sadness<br> lengthens Romeo's hours?<br> Not having that, which, having,<br> makes them short.<br> - But, Romeo...<br> - Farewell, coz.<br> What fray was here?<br> Tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br> Here's much to do with hate,<br> and more with love.<br> Soft! I will go along.<br> But Montague is bound<br> as well as I in penalty alike.<br> And 'tis not hard, I think, for men<br> as old as we to keep the peace.<br> Of honourable reckoning are you both,<br> and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.<br> But...<br> But now, my lord,<br> what say you to my suit?<br> But saying o'er what I have said before.<br> My child is yet a stranger in the world.<br> She hath not seen the change<br> of 14 years.<br> Let two more summers<br> wither in their pride,<br> ere we think her ripe to be a bride.<br> Younger than she<br> are happy mothers made.<br> And too soon marred<br> are those so early made.<br> The earth hath swallowed<br> all my hopes but she.<br> She is the hopeful lady of my earth.<br> But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.<br> My will to her consent is but a part.<br> Peter!<br> This night I hold<br> an old accustomed feast,<br> whereto I have invited many a guest<br> such as I love, you among the store.<br> One more, most welcome,<br> makes my number more.<br> Nurse, where's my daughter?<br> Call her forth to me.<br> By my maidenhead at 12 years old,<br> I bade her come.<br> Where is the girl? Juliet!<br> God forbid, where is the girl?<br> Juliet! Where is the girl?<br> Juliet!<br> How now! Who calls?<br> Your mother, your lady mother.<br> It's your lady mother.<br> Make haste, girl, make haste!<br> Where were you?<br> Madam, I am here.<br> What is your will?<br> This is the matter.<br> Make haste, girls. Come on.<br> Nurse, give leave awhile.<br> We must talk in secret.<br> Nurse, come back again.<br> I have remembered me.<br> Thou s'hear our counsel.<br> Thou knowest<br> my daughter's of a pretty age.<br> - I can tell her age unto an hour.<br> - She's not 14.<br> I'll lay 14 of my teeth,<br> and yet I have but four.<br> She is not 14.<br> How long is it to Lammastide?<br> - A fortnight and odd days.<br> - Even or odd,<br> come Lammas Eve at night<br> shall she be 14.<br> Susan and she, God rest<br> all Christian souls, were of an age.<br> Susan is with God.<br> She was too good for me.<br> But on Lammas Eve at night<br> shall she be 14.<br> That shall she. I remember it well.<br> My lord and you were then at Mantua.<br> Nay, I do bear a brain.<br> But then she could stand high lone.<br> Nay, she could have run<br> and waddled all about.<br> For even the day before,<br> she broke her brow.<br> And then my husband, oh,<br> God rest his soul, he were a merry man,<br> took up the child.<br> "Yea," quoth he,<br> "Dost thou fall upon thy face?<br> "Thou wilt fall backward<br> when thou hast more wit."<br> Nurse!<br> And, by my holidame,<br> the pretty wretch<br> left crying and said, "Ay."<br> Enough. I pray thee, hold thy peace.<br> Yes, madam.<br> Now, Juliet.<br> God mark thee to his grace!<br> Thou wast the prettiest babe<br> that e'er I nursed.<br> And I might live to see thee<br> married once, I have my wish.<br> Marry? That "marry" is<br> the very theme I came to talk of.<br> Tell me, daughter Juliet,<br> how stands your disposition<br> to be married?<br> - It is an honour that I dream not of.<br> - An honour!<br> Were not I thine only nurse, I would say<br> thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat.<br> Well, think of marriage now.<br> Younger than you, here in Verona,<br> ladies of esteem<br> are made already mothers.<br> I was your mother much upon<br> these years that you are now a maid.<br> - Yes, I remember.<br> - Thus then in brief.<br> The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.<br> A man, young lady!<br> Lady, such as all the world.<br> Why, he's a man of wax.<br> Verona's summer<br> hath not such a flower.<br> Nay, he's a flower...<br> What say you?<br> Can you love the gentleman?<br> Madam!<br> The guests are come, supper served up.<br> You called, my young lady asked for...<br> We follow.<br> Speak briefly.<br> Can you like of Paris' love?<br> I'll look to like, if looking liking move.<br> But no more deep will I endart mine eye<br> than your consent gives strength<br> to make it fly.<br> - Juliet, the County stays.<br> - Madam, I come.<br> Go, girl, seek happy nights<br> to happy days.<br> Give me a case to put my visage in.<br> A visor for a visor!<br> What care I what curious eye<br> doth quote deformities?<br> Here are the beetle brows<br> shall blush for me.<br> Shall this speech be spoke for excuse?<br> Or shall we on without apology?<br> The date is out of such prolixity.<br> Let them measure us by what they will.<br> We'll measure them a measure,<br> and be gone.<br> Knock and enter. And no sooner in,<br> but every man betake him to his legs.<br> We mean well in going to this mask.<br> - But 'tis no wit to go.<br> - Why, may one ask?<br> - I dreamt a dream tonight.<br> - And so did I.<br> Well, what was yours?<br> That dreamers often lie.<br> In bed asleep,<br> while they do dream things true.<br> Then I see Queen Mab<br> hath been with you.<br> Queen Mab?<br> She is...<br> She is the fairies' midwife,<br> and she comes in state<br> no bigger than an agate-stone<br> on the forefinger of an alderman,<br> drawn with a team of little atomies,<br> athwart men's noses as they lie asleep.<br> Her wagon-spokes are made<br> of long spinners' legs,<br> and the cover of the wings<br> of grasshoppers.<br> The traces of the smallest spider's web<br> and the collars of the moonshine's<br> watery beams.<br> Her whip, crack,<br> is a cricket's bone, the lash of film.<br> And in this state she gallops<br> night by night through lovers' brains,<br> and then they dream of love.<br> O'er ladies' lips,<br> who straight on kisses dream,<br> which oft the angry Mab<br> with blisters plagues,<br> because their breaths<br> with sweetmeats tainted are.<br> And sometime comes she<br> with a tithe pig's tail,<br> tickling a parson's nose<br> as he lies asleep.<br> Then dreams he of another benefice.<br> Amen.<br> Sometimes she driveth<br> o'er a soldier's neck,<br> and then dreams he of cutting<br> foreign throats, of breaches,<br> ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br> drums in his ear,<br> at which he starts and wakes,<br> and being thus frighted<br> swears a prayer or two<br> and sleeps again.<br> This is that very Mab that plaits<br> the manes of horses in the night,<br> and bakes the elflocks<br> in foul sluttish hairs,<br> which, once untangled,<br> much misfortune bodes.<br> This is the hag,<br> when maids lie on their backs,<br> that presses them<br> and learns them first to bear,<br> making them women of good carriage.<br> This is she... This is she that...<br> This is she.<br> Peace, Mercutio, peace!<br> Thou talk'st of nothing.<br> Thou talk'st of nothing.<br> True, true. I talk of dreams,<br> which are the children of an idle brain,<br> begot of nothing but vain fantasy,<br> which is as thin of substance as the air<br> and more inconstant than the wind,<br> who woos even now<br> the frozen bosom of the north,<br> and, being angered,<br> puffs away from thence,<br> turning his side<br> to the dew-dropping south.<br> This wind you talk of<br> blows us from ourselves.<br> Strike, drum!<br> On, lusty gentlemen!<br> Romeo, we shall arrive too late.<br> I fear too early,<br> for my mind misgives,<br> some consequence,<br> yet hanging in the stars,<br> shall bitterly begin his fearful date<br> with this night's revels<br> and expire the term<br> of a despised life closed in my breast<br> by some vile forfeit of untimely death.<br> But he that hath the steerage<br> of my course,<br> direct my sail!<br> Enter my poor house! Welcome!<br> My lovely niece! Welcome all!<br> Be merry, gentlemen. Be lively, ladies.<br> Welcome, gentlemen!<br> I have seen the day<br> that I have worn a visor<br> and could tell a whispering tale<br> in a fair lady's ear.<br> 'Tis gone, 'tis gone.<br> You are welcome, gentlemen! Ladies!<br> She doth teach the torches<br> to burn bright!<br> It seems she hangs upon<br> the cheek of night<br> as a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.<br> Beauty too rich for use,<br> for earth too dear.<br> So shows a snowy dove trooping<br> with crows,<br> as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.<br> Did my heart love till now?<br> Forswear it, sight!<br> For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.<br> This, by his voice,<br> should be a Montague.<br> Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe.<br> A villain come in spite<br> to scorn at our solemnity this night.<br> Young Romeo?<br> Dares the slave come hither<br> to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?<br> He bears him like a portly gentleman,<br> and Verona brags of him to be<br> a virtuous and well-managed youth.<br> I would not here in my house<br> do him disparagement.<br> Have patience, take no note of him.<br> The morisca! The morisca!<br> - Why, Uncle, 'tis a shame!<br> - Go to!<br> You are a saucy boy.<br> You'll make a mutiny among my guests?<br> Am I the master here or you?<br> - I will not endure him.<br> - You will not endure?<br> He shall be endured or I know what.<br> Well said, my hearts!<br> You're a princox.<br> Be quiet, or...<br> For shame! I'll make you quiet.<br> Leonardo will sing!<br> Leonardo, I pray thee, sing, sing!<br> What is a youth?<br> Impetuous fire<br> What is a maid?<br> Ice and desire<br> The world wags on<br> A rose will bloom<br> It then will fade<br> So does a youth<br> So does the fairest maid<br> Comes a time when one sweet smile<br> Has its season for a while<br> Then love's in love with me<br> Some they think only to marry<br> Others will tease and tarry<br> Mine is the very best parry<br> Cupid, he rules us all<br> Caper the caper, sing me the song<br> Death will come soon to hush us along<br> Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall<br> Love is a pastime that never will pall<br> Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall<br> Cupid, he rules us all<br> A rose will bloom<br> Then will fade<br> So does a youth<br> So does the fairest maid<br> If I profane with my unworthiest hand<br> this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this.<br> My lips, two blushing pilgrims,<br> ready stand<br> to smooth the rough touch<br> with a gentle kiss.<br> Good pilgrim,<br> you do wrong your hand too much,<br> which mannerly devotion shows in this.<br> For saints have hands<br> that pilgrims' hands do touch,<br> and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.<br> Have not saints lips<br> and holy palmers, too?<br> Ay, pilgrim,<br> lips that they must use in prayer.<br> O, then, dear saint,<br> let lips do what hands do.<br> They pray, grant thou,<br> lest faith turn to despair.<br> Saints do not move,<br> though grant for prayers' sake.<br> Then move not,<br> while my prayer's effect I take.<br> Thus from my lips<br> by thine my sin is purged.<br> Then have my lips<br> the sin that they have took.<br> Sin from my lips?<br> O trespass sweetly urged!<br> Give me my sin again.<br> A rose will bloom<br> It then will fade<br> So does a youth<br> So does<br> The fairest maid<br> - Juliet!

Hie hence, be gone, away!<br> Romeo, it is!<br> It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br> straining harsh discords<br> and unpleasing sharps.<br> Some say the lark<br> makes sweet division.<br> This doth not so, for she divideth us.<br> So, now be gone.<br> More light and light it grows.<br> More light and light.<br> More dark and dark our woes!<br> Madam! Your lady mother<br> comes to your chamber!<br> Your lady mother is coming<br> to your chamber.<br> The day is broke. Look about.<br> Art thou gone so? My husband, friend!<br> I must hear from thee<br> every day in the hour,<br> for in a minute there are many days.<br> O, by this count I shall be much in<br> years ere I again behold my Romeo!<br> I will omit no opportunity that may<br> convey my greetings, love, to thee.<br> Think'st thou we shall ever meet again?<br> I doubt it not.<br> And all these woes shall serve for<br> sweet discourses in our time to come.<br> Farewell, farewell!<br> One kiss, and I'll descend.<br> Adieu.<br> Adieu!<br> O God!<br> We will have vengeance for it,<br> fear thou not.<br> Then weep no more.<br> I'll send to one in Mantua, where<br> that same banished runagate doth live,<br> shall give him<br> such an unaccustomed dram<br> that he shall soon keep Tybalt company.<br> But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.<br> Thou hast a careful father.<br> One who, to put thee<br> from thy heaviness,<br> hath sorted out a sudden day of joy.<br> Joy comes well in such a needy time.<br> Marry, my child,<br> early next Thursday morn,<br> the gallant, young and noble prince,<br> the County Paris,<br> at St. Peter's Church, shall happily<br> make thee there a joyful bride.<br> Now, by St. Peter's Church<br> and Peter, too,<br> he shall not make me<br> there a joyful bride!<br> No! No!<br> So it is concluded.<br> Son Paris.<br> How now, wife.<br> Have you delivered to her our decree?<br> Ay, sir. But she will none,<br> she gives you thanks.<br> I would the fool were married<br> to her grave!<br> Soft!<br> Take me with you.<br> Take me with you, wife.<br> How! Will she none?<br> Doth she not give us thanks?<br> Is she not proud?<br> Doth she not count her blest<br> that we have wrought so worthy<br> a gentleman to be her bridegroom?<br> Wretched fool! Let me see her!<br> Ungrateful baggage!<br> Thou shalt not house with me.<br> Fie! What, are you mad?<br> Hang thee, young baggage!<br> Disobedient wretch!<br> Get thee to church on Thursday,<br> or never after look me in the face.<br> - Father, I beseech you!<br> - Reply not!<br> - Do not answer me! My fingers itch.<br> - God in heaven bless her!<br> - You are to blame to rate her so.<br> - And why?<br> Hold your tongue, good prudence! Go!<br> I speak no treason. May not one speak?<br> Peace, you mumbling fool!<br> Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl!<br> You are too hot.<br> God's bread, it makes me mad!<br> Thursday is near.<br> Lay hand on heart, advise.<br> And you be mine,<br> I'll give you to my friend.<br> And you be not, hang, beg, starve,<br> die in the streets!<br> For I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,<br> nor what is mine<br> shall never do thee good!<br> - Father!<br> - Trust to't, bethink you.<br> I'll not be forsworn!<br> Oh, no! No!<br> O sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br> - Delay this marriage for a month.<br> - Talk not to me. I'll not speak a word!<br> Do as thou wilt,<br> for I have done with thee.<br> O God!<br> O nurse!<br> How shall this be prevented?<br> What say'st thou?<br> Hast thou not a word of joy?<br> Some comfort, nurse.<br> Faith, here it is.<br> Romeo is banished.<br> All the world to nothing that he dares<br> ne'er come back to challenge you.<br> Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br> Then, since the case so stands<br> as now it doth,<br> I think it best you marry with the County.<br> True.<br> O, he's a lovely gentleman.<br> Romeo is a dishclout to him!<br> An eagle, madam, hath not so green,<br> so quick, so fair an eye as Paris hath.<br> I think you are happy<br> in this second match<br> for it excels your first.<br> Or if it did not, your first is dead.<br> Or 'twere as good he were,<br> as living here and you no use of him.<br> Speakest thou from thy heart?<br> And from my soul, too.<br> - Or else beshrew them both.<br> - Amen!<br> What?<br> Well, thou hast comforted me<br> marvellous much.<br> Go in and tell my lady I am gone,<br> having displeased my father,<br> to Laurence's cell<br> to make confession and to be absolved.<br> Marry, I shall.<br> - This is wisely done.<br> - Go!<br> You say you do not know<br> the lady's mind?<br> Uneven is the course. I like it not.<br> Immoderately she weeps<br> for Tybalt's death,<br> and therefore have I little talked of love,<br> for Venus smiles not<br> in a house of tears.<br> Happily met, my lady and my wife.<br> That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.<br> Come you to make confession<br> to this father?<br> Are you at leisure, holy father, now?<br> Or shall I come to you at evening mass?<br> My leisure serves me,<br> pensive daughter, now.<br> My lord, we must entreat the time alone.<br> God shield I should disturb devotion!<br> Juliet, on Thursday early<br> will I rouse thee.<br> Till then, adieu.<br> And keep this holy kiss.<br> O shut the door!<br> And when thou hast done so,<br> come weep with me!<br> Past hope, past care, past help!<br> Juliet, I already know thy grief.<br> Tell me not, friar,<br> that thou hear'st of this,<br> unless thou tell me how I can prevent it!<br> If in thy wisdom<br> thou canst give no help...<br> Hold, daughter.<br> I do spy a kind of hope, as that is<br> desperate which we would prevent.<br> If rather than to marry County Paris...<br> Bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br> from off the battlements of any tower!<br> Bid me go into a new-made grave,<br> and hide me with a dead man!<br> Hold, then.<br> Go home.<br> Be merry.<br> Give consent to marry Paris.<br> Wednesday is tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone.<br> Let not thy nurse lie with thee<br> in thy chamber.<br> Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br> and this distilling liquor drink thou off.<br> Presently through all thy veins<br> shall run a cold and drowsy humour,<br> for no pulse shall keep<br> his native progress, but surcease.<br> No warmth, no breath,<br> shall testify thou livest.<br> And in this borrowed likeness<br> of shrunk death<br> thou shalt continue two and 40 hours.<br> And then awake<br> as from a pleasant sleep.<br> In the meantime,<br> against thou shalt awake,<br> shall Romeo by my letters<br> know our drift,<br> and hither shall he come.<br> And he and I will watch thy waking,<br> and that very night shall Romeo<br> bear thee hence to Mantua.<br> Give me, give me!<br> Tell not me of fear!<br> Hold.<br> Get thee gone, be strong<br> and prosperous in this resolve.<br> How now, my headstrong.<br> Where have you been gadding?<br> Where I have learned me to repent<br> the sin of disobedient opposition.<br> Pardon me.<br> Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.<br> Why, I am glad on't!<br> This is well. Stand up.<br> This is as it should be.<br> Love, give me strength!<br> Give this letter into<br> the hand of Romeo, in Mantua.<br> My lord! My lord! She's dead!<br> Juliet is dead!<br> My lady Juliet, my lord. She's dead!<br> Juliet! Juliet!<br> Juliet! My baby, where is she?<br> O lamentable day!<br> Death lies on her like an untimely frost<br> upon the sweetest flower of all the field.<br> - Master?<br> - Balthasar!<br> How fares my Juliet?<br> For nothing can be ill if she be well.<br> How fares my lady?<br> She's dead, my lord. She's dead.<br> Her body sleeps in Capel's monument.<br> I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault.<br> Then I defy you, stars!<br> Live, and be prosperous.<br> Farewell, good fellow.<br> Juliet.<br> O my love!<br> My wife!<br> Death, that hath<br> sucked the honey of thy breath,<br> hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.<br> Thou art not conquered.<br> Beauty's ensign yet is crimson<br> in thy lips and in thy cheeks.<br> Death's pale flag is not advanced there.<br> Tybalt.<br> Liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br> What more favour can I do to thee<br> than with that hand<br> that cut thy youth in twain<br> to sunder his that was thine enemy?<br> Forgive me, cousin.<br> Dear Juliet!<br> Why art thou yet so fair?<br> Shall I believe<br> that unsubstantial death is amorous<br> and that the abhorred monster<br> keeps thee here to be his paramour?<br> For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,<br> never from this palace of dim night<br> depart again.<br> Here, here will I remain with worms<br> that are thy chamber-maids!<br> Eyes, look your last!<br> Arms, take your last embrace!<br> And, lips, O you the doors of breath,<br> seal with a righteous kiss<br> a dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br> Here's to my love!<br> Thus, with a kiss,<br> I die.<br> - Who's there?<br> - A friend.<br> - And one that knows thee well.<br> - How long hast thou been here?<br> - Full half an hour.<br> - Go with me to the vault.<br> I dare not, sir. My master<br> knows not but I am gone hence.<br> Stay, then. I'll go alone.<br> Fear comes upon me!<br> O much I fear some ill unlucky thing.<br> Pale!<br> What an unkind hour<br> is guilty of this lamentable chance!<br> O comfortable friar!<br> Where is my lord?<br> I do remember well<br> where I should be, and there I am.<br> Where is my Romeo?<br> I hear some noise.<br> Where is my Romeo?<br> Lady, come from this nest of death,<br> contagion and unnatural sleep.<br> A greater power than we can contradict<br> hath thwarted our intents.<br> Come along. The watch is coming.<br> Where is my Romeo?<br> Come, go, good Juliet.<br> I dare no longer stay.<br> I dare no longer stay!<br> Juliet!<br> I dare no longer stay!<br> What's here?<br> Poison, I see,<br> hath been his timeless end.<br> O churl!<br> Drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br> to help me after?<br> I will kiss thy lips.<br> Haply some poison yet doth hang on<br> them to make me die with a restorative.<br> Thy lips are warm!<br> Yea, noise?<br> No!<br> Then I'll be brief.<br> O happy dagger!<br> This is thy sheath.<br> There rust, and let me die.<br> Where be these enemies?<br> Capulet.<br> Montague.<br> See what a scourge<br> is laid upon your hates,<br> that heaven finds means<br> to kill your joys with love.<br> And I, for winking at your discords, too,<br> have lost a brace of kinsmen.<br> All are punished.<br> All are punished!<br> A glooming peace<br> this morning with it brings.<br> The Sun, for sorrow,<br> will not show his head.<br> For never was a story of more woe<br> than this of Juliet and her Romeo.<br>
