I know<br> that you can get this.<br> Where do you think that<br> Old Nick gets our food?<br> - From TV by magic!<br> - There is no magic.<br> What you see on TV, those are pictures<br> of real things, of real people.<br> It's real stuff.<br> Dora's real for real?<br> No, that's a drawing.<br> Dora is a drawing.<br> But other people...<br> They have faces like us.<br> Those are pictures of real things.<br> And all the other stuff you see<br> on there, that's real too.<br> That's real oceans,<br> real trees, real cats.<br> No way.<br> - Where they all fit?<br> - They just do, they just fit.<br> They just fit out in the world.<br> Jack, c'mon...<br> You're so smart. I know that<br> you've been wondering about this.<br> Can I have something else to eat?<br> There's a leaf!<br> - Do you see that?<br> - Where?<br> Look.<br> I don't see a leaf.<br> Come here, I want you to see.<br> Come have a closer look.<br> You see that? See?<br> Dumbo Ma, that's not leaf,<br> leaves are green.<br> Yeah, on trees, but then they fall<br> and they rot, like salad in the fridge.<br> Where's all that<br> stuff you said?<br> Trees and dogs<br> and cats and grass?<br> Well, we can't see<br> it from here...<br> because the skylight looks<br> upwards instead of sideways.<br> You're just tricking me.<br> No, I'm not.<br> - Liar, liar, pants on fire!<br> - Jack!<br> I couldn't explain it before<br> because you were too small...<br> you were to small to understand<br> so I had to make up a story. But...<br> But now I'm doing the opposite.<br> Ok, I'm doing the opposite<br> of lying, I am unlying.<br> Because you're five now.<br> You're five and you're<br> old enough to understand...<br> what the world is.<br> You have to understand!<br> You have to understand!<br> We can't keep living like<br> this you need to help me.<br> I want to be four again.<br> Do you remember how...<br> Do you remember how Alice<br> wasn't always in Wonderland?<br> She fell down, down down<br> deep in the hole.<br> Well, I wasn't always in room,<br> I'm like Alice.<br> I was a little girl named Joy.<br> Nah...<br> And I lived in a house<br> with my mom and my dad.<br> You would called<br> them Grandma and Grandpa.<br> What house?!<br> A house, it was in the world.<br> And there was backyard,<br> we had hammock.<br> We would swing in the hammock<br> and we eat ice cream.<br> A TV house?<br> No, Jack, a real house, not TV.<br> Are you even listening to me?<br> When I was a little older,<br> when I was 17...<br> I was walking home from school...<br> - Where was I?<br> - You were still up in heaven.<br> But there was a guy,<br> he pretended that his dog was sick...<br> What guy?<br> Old Nick,<br> we called him Old Nick.<br> I don't know what<br> his real name is.<br> But he pretended<br> his dog was sick.<br> What's the dog's name?<br> Jack, there wasn't a dog!<br> He was trying to trick me, ok?<br> There wasn't a dog,<br> Old Nick stole me.<br> I want a different story!<br> No, this is the story<br> that you get!<br> He put me in<br> his garden shed.<br> Here. Room is the shed.<br> He's locked the door and he's<br> the only one that knows the code.<br> You know, the secret<br> numbers that open the door?<br> He is the only one that knows and<br> I've been locked in here for seven years.<br> I've been in here for seven years,<br> do you understand?<br> This story is boring!<br> Jack, the world is so big!<br> It's so big you wouldn't<br> even believe it.<br> And Room is just one<br> stinky part of it.<br> Room is not stinky,<br> only when you do a fart!<br> My God...<br> I don't believe<br> in you stinky world!<br> Ma...<br> It's warm again.<br> Ma...<br> Ma...<br> Ma...<br> Eggsnake's our longest<br> friend and fanciest.<br> Meltedy Spoon's the best to eat<br> with because he's more blobbier.<br> Labyrinth is the twistiest.<br> And she hides things so I<br> don't know where they are.<br> Toilet's the best<br> at disappearing poo.<br> Lamp's the brightest except<br> when the power is cut.<br> You're the best at reading<br> and songs and lots.<br> Except if you're<br> having a Gone Day.<br> I'm the best at drawing and jumping<br> and growing and nearly everything.<br> [TV] But the turtle is<br> no longer afraid of that.<br> She is bigger now and<br> her shell is much harder.<br> Are turtles real?<br> Yeah, they are totally real.<br> I had a turtle as a pet.<br> And crocodiles and sharks?<br> Yeah, they are all real.<br> Real?<br> Sort of.<br> So, these are real people but<br> they are playing dress-up.<br> They are pretending that they're<br> people from hundreds of years ago.<br> Just TV?<br> You're getting it!<br> When Old Nick comes back,<br> I'm gonna kick him in the butt.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> You know, one time I tried<br> to kick Old Nick in the butt.<br> I hid behind the door.<br> And I was holding the lid<br> from the toilet tank.<br> There used to be a lid on it,<br> it was the heaviest thing in Room.<br> When he came in<br> I smashed it on his head.<br> But I messed up.<br> He shoved the door closed and<br> he grabbed me by the wrist.<br> That's why it's sore now.<br> We could wait till he's<br> asleep and kill him dead.<br> Yeah, we could, but...<br> Then what?...<br> We'd ran out of food.<br> And we don't know<br> the code to the door.<br> Hey!
