It's not that at all.<br> Well, it's partly that but not just that.<br> She's so wholesome.<br> And you think you'd find her wholesome if her old man didn't have a million in the bank.<br> There are plenty of other wholesome girls in Warnley, you know.<br> Like who? Like June?<br> Yes, like June.<br> Say you got you some kind of understanding with her?<br> Me lord Nooo! June's a good kid but she's got an invalid mother.<br> And they live of June's salary, the pair of them.

We got 4 to 1. What are you on?<br> Grade one. I put my 2 bob on grade one everytime.<br> In number 2 to win please.<br> How about that baby?<br> That one, she's grade 10.<br> Grade 9 and over means boredom on Saturday nights, you wanna keep miles away from them.<br> All on 4 to win, please.<br> Now grade ones like my girl<br> they'll be really something special in bed, you see that they have almost nothing else to do.<br> Come on Joe, there's the bell.<br> That Brown he must ... , you know.<br> All those chimneys, that's money.<br> Beautiful, beautiful brass.<br> Belching out every minute of the day and night.<br> Come on.<br> You know Charles, I've been thinking about that dramatic club.<br> You remember you said you need man, a fresh blood and all that.<br> Did you mean it?<br> I certainly did.<br> Well I don't know if I'm really good, mind but I'd like to try.<br> Oh, I get it.<br> You're not interested in dramatics it's Susan.<br> Ohh, I know. "You're wasting your time Joe." But do you wanna bet on it?<br> Did I here somebody say bet ?<br> I bet you'd never gonna get a length of a date with her.<br> A Dollar on it then.<br> Right then. Cut it.<br> (BACKGROUND TALKING)<br> Hello Susan.<br> Hello.<br> You know I never seemed to get a chance to speak to you.<br> I only joined the club because of you<br> now I here that you're not even in the new play.<br> Somebody else has to have a chance, it's only fair.<br> Gwen is awfully good, she will do it very well.<br> Quiet, please.<br> Damn...

On top of the sofa there.<br> Alice, love I want you to start at the scene where you defend your lover.<br> It's the top of page 12. Now stand there.<br> Here we are. "I don't see why ..." and don't forget love, there's the audience.<br> Push it right out. From when I say go, ready ?<br> Right!<br> I don't see why he didn't even know my late husband, I ensure you inspector<br> he has got nothing to do with it.<br> He's something to do with you love, hasn't he?<br> Really?<br> Just what do you mean by that inspector?<br> Oh, you are a friend of her's sir? You are, aren't you?<br> I tell you, I didn't see anything. It was pitch dark.<br> And the only sign of light was that old workman or nightwatchman sitting by his brassiere.<br> (PEOPLE LAUGHING)<br> Brazier.<br> That's a wonderful thought. Erotic vise among the working class.<br> Let me tell you, I am working class.<br> I didn't mean...<br> Working class and proud of it!<br> You're nothing of the sort, you're a stock broker and Alice is the lover<br> and the suspected of murder in the play.<br> Now shut up the lot of you. Now we'll start again.<br> When you come to the point when you say "What's the point?"

Tell me, but supposing you are a girl,<br> I mean a young girl. And I asked you out, I mean would you hang up in a hurry<br> just because your mother came into the room.<br> Look Joe, if I had a mother like Mrs. Brown, I would hang up in a great hurry<br> whenever she came into the room.<br> Aren't you two coming? Where's Charles?<br> He'll be over in a minute.<br> I still think she was trying t give me the brush off.<br> Well supposing she was.<br> Keep trying, call her again.<br> You really mean it?<br> Ofcourse, why not?<br> Oh, errr... well While I'm handing out advice,<br> Do you mind if I tell you about our last scene, the bedroom one...<br> Oh, I know I...

You know I love you both.<br> That doesn't get me anywhere with my dinner party.<br> Why didn't you stop her?<br> Because stopping her seeing that man isn't the way to put an end to it.<br> Then what is?<br> Don't you mind her getting mixed up with a small town nobody.<br> Small town nobody sometimes do well enough. You saw that wrong once with one, mother.<br> I happened to be Susan's mother, not yours.<br> Now listen, would you stop bothering your head about Joe Lampton.<br> And just leave it to me.<br> Get me the town hall.<br> I have a minute to do, I thought we might have a little chat.<br> You picked up the work very quickly.<br> Not quite.<br> You're a bright lad Lampton.

Yes, he even called me Joe.<br> If you don't leave Susan alone there will be no promoiton for you.<br> I told you months ago Joe, I warned you.

A dirty little thrill. I suppose you see me as your own private<br> dirty postcard.<br> You can't imagine that a man could look at a naked woman without wanting to make love to her<br> Can you?<br> If you want to know, I can't.<br> Elsbeth isn't rich you know. You needn't drink all her gin.<br> Give that to her and tell her I broke the bottle.<br> To think I ever let you touch me.<br> Now listen, I own my own body and I'm not ashamed of it.<br> And I'm not ashamed of anything I've ever done.<br> If you'd mixed with intelligent people,<br> you wouldn't be glaring at me if I've had committed some crime.<br> Oh, some of the things you've told me about yourself, I can just see you in Dufton now.<br> Looking at nudes in magazines, drooling over them.<br> Saying you wouldn't mind having a quick bash, that's one of your urge, isn't it?<br> The (...) girl's calling them shameless whores.<br> Oh, shut up!<br> You make a great todo about your humble beginnings.<br> but you've never really been (...)<br> You've never gone hungry.<br> What do you think a POW gets to eat?<br> Hmm, even then you didn't starve.<br> There always been somebody to take care of old Joe.<br> Got extra, tell me yourself.<br> Because you got along so well with the guards.<br> Why didn't you have the guts to escape?<br> Like Jack Wales ?<br> Don't mention that swine's name to me.<br> It was allright for him to escape.<br> He had a rich father to look after him and buy him an education.<br> Those 3 years were the only chance I get to be qualified.<br> Let all those rich bastards who have all the fun, be heros.<br> Let them pay for their privileges.<br> If you want that straight from this soldier, I was bloody well pleased that I was captured.<br> I didn't like being a prisoner but it was a damn sigh better than being dead.<br> Come to that!<br> What did you do 50 years ago back in the Great War?<br> You want some tea?<br> I don't want anything.<br> It was good while it lasted.<br> I mean that.<br> I'm sorry that it had to end like this.<br> I'm sorry too.<br> Good bye, Alice.<br> Good bye.<br> (PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)<br> Ahh, Cinderella has arrived.<br> Charles...<br> Whiskey please.<br> Yeah, whiskey...

Alice told me she wants to divorce me.<br> Well I'm not agreeable.<br> You haven't any choice.<br> She's my wife and she's going to remain my wife.<br> I want to make it quite clear to you.<br> She has no grounds for divorce.<br> Everybody knows the way you treat her, that's about you and your women.<br> But nobody can prove anything.<br> The difference between you and me is that I haven't been indiscreet enough<br> to leave evidence lying around.<br> Meaning what?<br> Just this; If she brings an action of divorce I'll fight it.<br> I'll smear you both across the headlines.<br> It will make fine reading, Elsbeth's flat, the naked bathing in Dorset<br> and all the rest of it.<br> How did you know?<br> I make it my business to know. It'll break you because you<br> can't stand a scandal like that and you know it.<br> And you won't get Alice either. Because I still won't let her go.<br> You can't hold her. Maybe she can't divorce you but she can leave you,<br> you can't stop her from leaving you.<br> Can you keep her?<br> I can keep her because I love her.<br> She's 10 years older than you and she hasn't a penny of her own.<br> If she leaves me, I'll sue you for enticement.<br> Then you won't be able to support even yourself.<br> You got everything pretty well worked out, haven't you?<br> I have, there are no loop holes, get it clear from now on you'll leave Alice alone.<br> Understand me?<br> Why won't you let her go? Why?<br> Because she's my wife. That's why.<br> You trying to tell me you still love her?<br> I'm not trying to tell you anything.<br> I've let you off lightly.
