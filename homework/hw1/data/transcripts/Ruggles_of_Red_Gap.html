How socially?<br> - Why, in Red Gap.<br> It will give us, er...tone, joie de vivre.<br> What's that?<br> It...um...er...tone.<br> To have him there.<br> Havin' who?<br> Effie, you ain't aimin' on taking Ruggles<br> to Red Gap?<br> I certainly am.<br> Egbert, get your clothes on.<br> Now look-a-here, Effie.<br> I can be pushed just so far and no further.<br> Egbert.

Rather, yes.<br> Ha-ha. Yes.

Wait a minute.<br> You ain't got time. Effie's in a hurry.<br> You'd better check in first<br> and then pick up your duds later, see?<br> Very good, sir.<br> Is there anything further<br> I can do for you, my lord?<br> I fancy not, Ruggles, no.<br> This is rather sudden, isn't it?<br> Well, bound to be sudden,<br> you know, a thing like this, I mean.<br> I can't help worrying about<br> what will happen to you, my lord.<br> Oh, Ruggles, don't.

Thank you, my lord.<br> - Oh, don't thank me.<br> - I ought to thank you, really.<br> - No, my lord.<br> I am ready, sir.<br> Eh?<br> Oh, yes, yes, sure.<br> It's kind of sad, ain't it?<br> Well, so long, Earl. Keep your head up.<br> Goodbye, Floud.<br> Thank you.<br> Goodbye, my lord.<br> He has the worst taste<br> of any man I ever knew.<br> - To the cleaner, madame?<br> - To the cleaner?<br> I want the whole lot<br> taken out and burned.<br> - Burned, madame?<br> - Burned to ashes.<br> - And then burn the ashes.<br> - Oui, madame.<br> My husband is to have<br> an entirely new outfit.<br> Er...will you look at that?<br> He liked that so well,<br> he bought two of them.<br> Even the moths wouldn't eat those.<br> Come on, Bill, come on, come on.<br> Stir your stumps.<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Where you going with my clothes?<br> Well, maybe...maybe<br> she's gonna get 'em pressed.<br> Well, this is the place.<br> Here we go.

Go on, go on.<br> - Oh, no, no, sir.<br> What, are we gonna do this<br> all over again?<br> Madame, what, er...<br> what can I do for you today?<br> We want a lot of things<br> for the gentleman.<br> - Ah, for the gentleman?<br> - This is the gentleman.<br> Ah.<br> Oh, something...something similar<br> to what he's wearing?<br> Similar to... What is this,<br> a second-hand store?<br> Oh, no, madame!<br> You see, he got these clothes<br> under the most peculiar circumstances.<br> You see, he...<br> Mm.<br> The gentleman's present condition<br> is purely the result of an accident.<br> The gentleman's hotel<br> burned down during the night.<br> The gentleman rushed from the burning<br> building in, er...the altogether.<br> Wait, wait, wait! What is all this?<br> The gentleman was forced to accept<br> the loan of garments from onlookers.<br> All circus people!<br> Now I understand the gentleman's<br> ridiculous appearance!<br> Well, you...you ain't<br> no geranium yourself.<br> Egbert.<br> Would you be kind enough to show us<br> something in morning coats?<br> Morning coats?<br> Mais oui, monsieur. Un moment.<br> Try to walk, Egbert.<br> What do you think of him, Ruggles?<br> In the main, madam,<br> I am not dissatisfied.<br> I think he looks very distingu.<br> Gay nothing. I look like that bantam<br> rooster I had before it was run over.<br> When you came in here,<br> you looked like that bantam rooster<br> after he was run over.<br> Voil, monsieur, the spats!<br> Oh, now, look-a-here, Bill! Now,<br> I don't have to wear them things, do I?<br> Spats, sir, mark the difference<br> between a man well turned out<br> and a man merely dressed.<br> Now, Egbert, go over and sit down<br> and be well turned out.<br> No, sir, I won't wear 'em.<br> I won't wear 'em.<br> They'll make me look like<br> my drawers were hanging down.<br> - Monsieur!<br> - No, sir.<br> I can be pushed just so far<br> and no further!<br> - Monsieur! Un moment!<br> - Egbert! Egbert!<br> Ruggles, Ruggles, go...go catch him!<br> Oh, dear!<br> Why, Egbert,<br> you look like a different man!<br> Yeah, maybe I'd better change<br> my name.<br> Here, here, here, here!<br> What are you gonna do now?<br> - We're...we're going to trim it.<br> - Oh, no, you won't!<br> But, Egbert, it doesn't go with the spats.<br> I don't care. That moustache<br> is gonna stay just the way it is.<br> What would the fellows say in Red Gap,<br> if they saw me come home<br> with a cut moustache?<br> No, sir, you don't go and get...<br> All right, all right, you can chew the rag<br> about it as much as you want.<br> I ain't gonna let you do it.<br> It took me 20 years<br> to build up this moustache<br> and I ain't gonna have<br> nobody monkey with it now.<br> Oh, Egbert!<br> Oh, Effie!<br> - Hm.<br> - Oh, madam!<br> Gah!<br> Oh, Bill!<br> Effie, I wouldn't do that to a dog.<br> Look, Egbert, isn't it nice?<br> - How do you like it, monsieur?<br> - Well, I don't know. Let me see.<br> How would you like it?<br> Monsieur!<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I'm going home.<br> I'm gonna find myself a closet<br> so that I can hide in it.<br> Oh, no, you're not.<br> You're going with Ruggles.<br> Now, come along.<br> Come on, get out there.<br> I wish you'd make up your mind, Effie.<br> Oh, Ruggles?<br> While I do some shopping, you might<br> spend a few hours with Egbert...<br> I mean Mr Floud, in the art galleries.<br> Art galleries? Yes, madam.<br> Yes, he's been writing down a few<br> of his impressions in this little book.<br> Art, it seems,<br> is Egbert's emotional outlet.<br> Get him home early, Ruggles.<br> We have a few very important people<br> coming in for dinner.<br> And see that he acts like a gentleman,<br> if you have to hog-tie him.<br> Place Vendme!<br> Er...goodbye...goodbye, Effie.<br> Goodbye.<br> We have a common sympathy in<br> the pictorial arts, if I may say so, sir.<br> - Mm-hm?<br> - Shall we stroll towards the Louvre?<br> Wait a minute. She'll be<br> around the corner in a minute.<br> Now.<br> Come on, let's grab a table.<br> Madam instructed me to conduct you<br> to the art galleries, sir.<br> Well...well, you wouldn't know it,<br> but this is it. Come on.<br> - Hey, Max! Oh, Max?<br> - Oui, monsieur.<br> - Max, bring me my book, you know...<br> - Oui, monsieur.<br> They keep my book handy here for me.<br> - I...I got a system.<br> - Oh!<br> Oh, monsieur, qu'il est grand!<br> Quelle surprise!<br> Yeah, yeah, they tricked me.<br> - That's it, Max, now, give me a pencil.<br> - Oui, monsieur.<br> - And give us a couple of beers.<br> - Oui, monsieur, oui, oui.<br> Now, here's what I do, Bill, see?<br> I copy out of this here big book<br> into this here little one,<br> and then I show Effie<br> how much I learned at the art galleries.<br> Yes, sir, but I fail to see how you are<br> to acquire culture in this way, sir.<br> Well, I don't know. I been getting away<br> with it ever since I come to Paris.<br> Now, look, you write it this time and<br> that'll make it stronger with Effie, see?<br> And pick out something good,<br> something in the middle there,<br> about, "Here lies the true lovers of art<br> entranced" or something.<br> Here is displayed<br> in its full flower, sir...<br> Well, sit down, sit down.<br> You can't write standing up.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Oh, no, sir.<br> Oh. Oh, I know<br> what's the matter with you.<br> You think I'm mad at you on account<br> of these clothes and everything, huh?<br> Well, I ain't.<br> I may be a little mad at Effie, but I ain't<br> mad at you. Now, go on, sit down.<br> There is a certain difference<br> in our walks of life, sir,<br> which makes it impossible for me to sit<br> at the same table with yourself, sir.<br> Well, you ain't ashamed to sit here,<br> are you?<br> Ashamed? It isn't that, sir.<br> It just doesn't do for a gentleman's<br> servant to sit with his superiors, sir.<br> Superiors, nothing. You're as good as I am,<br> and I'm as good as you are, ain't I?<br> - Well, sir...<br> - Well, ain't I?<br> Er...yes, sir.<br> Well, then, what's eatin' you?

Where I come from,<br> everybody is equal, see?<br> Ah, that may be<br> all very well for America, sir,<br> but it would never do with us.<br> Well, let's not get into no more argument<br> about it.

Yes, madam.<br> And to think of Egbert and Jeff Tuttle<br> trailing you around Paris<br> trying to save you from yourself.<br> I shall never forget that, madam.<br> Of course, er...Jeff Tuttle's an Indian<br> but Egbert is different.<br> - One or two lumps, madam?<br> - Oh, none, none.<br> Think of your dragging him out of<br> an art gallery and taking him places that...<br> Oh! Must have disgusted him.<br> Making him ride on a merry-go-round.<br> I...I don't know<br> where you got such ideas.<br> I was not myself, madam.<br> You don't look like a periodical souse.<br> Oh, madam, please.<br> But to show that I'm broadminded,<br> you can go and get yourself a drink.<br> Oh, thank you, madam.<br> I know how you feel.<br> - Er...on account of my husband.<br> - Of course, madam.<br> But I shall forgive and forget.<br> That's my nature.<br> And now, Ruggles,<br> tomorrow we're sailing for home.<br> - Home, madam?<br> - Yes, home, America.

Well, didn't he?<br> Quiet.<br> Mr Belknap-Jackson<br> is the leader of our Red Gap society.<br> You know, until he came out here,<br> you'd hardly believe it,<br> but nobody even thought<br> of using doilies under finger bowls.<br> Did they, Egbert?<br> Nobody even thought<br> of using finger bowls.<br> How very extraordinary!<br> No, sir. Finger bowls.<br> Here he comes!<br> I hope Europe has helped Egbert.<br> How could anything help Egbert?<br> Effie!<br> Oh, my dear!

Ma Pettingill.<br> Any time you can't find Egbert,<br> just try the old Silver Dollar.<br> We'll be there.<br> - Hiya, Ma.<br> - Hiya, Sam.<br> The others'll be along in a minute.<br> Libby, Willy, meet Colonel Ruggles.<br> - Howdy-do.<br> - How do you do, Colonel?<br> - A genuine blackamoor, madam?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - And a China person?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> What do you think of the place?<br> It's large.<br> Belknap-Jackson and my two daughters<br> put their house-building ideas together<br> and this is what happened.<br> The only thing I had to do with it<br> was pay for it.<br> But I can't lose. I can sell it<br> any time to the city for a depot.<br> And then I go on to say,<br> "The Flouds were accompanied<br> by their English manservant,<br> "secured through the courtesy<br> of the Earl of Burnstead.<br> "He will no doubt lend a continental<br> flavour to the Floud mansion."<br> - How's that, Belknap?<br> - I think...<br> Yeah, some mess of words.<br> Egbert, I want you to take this over<br> to Jake Henshaw at the newspaper office<br> and be sure that he prints it.<br> - Ruggles!<br> - Yes, madam!<br> - Oh, Ruggles!<br> - Yes, madam.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - Yes, madam.<br> Er...Ruggles, I want you to accompany<br> Mr Floud to the newspaper office.<br> Yes, madam.<br> And, er...see that he makes<br> no stops on the way.<br> - Oh, Effie, you know me.<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, look-a-here,<br> do I have to carry these?<br> - Why, certainly.<br> - Oh...!<br> - Oh, Ruggles?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Will you see<br> that he comes straight home?<br> Remember,<br> we're holding you responsible.<br> - By the light<br> - By the light, by the light<br> Of the silvery moon<br> Of the silvery moon...<br> Listen, listen, Bill. That's Nell Kenner<br> singing. Ain't that pretty?<br> - Who, sir?<br> - This is Nell Kenner's house. Come on.<br> May I remind you we are instructed to<br> proceed to the newspaper office, sir?<br> Yeah, well, we'll get around to that.<br> We'll head in here first. Come on.<br> You know, Effie and her circle of cats<br> is always got their harpoons out for Nell.<br> But believe me,<br> she's as right as a church.<br> But it is highly improper for you<br> to take your valet about with you, sir.<br> Aw, they won't know you from the Duke<br> of Kakiac. Come on in and mix.<br> Oh, no, sir.<br> Say, look-a-here,<br> who are you working for anyway?<br> You, sir.<br> - Mix, sir? Yes, sir.<br> - Yeah.<br> Uh-oh, look out, I forgot something.<br> Come here, come here.<br> You better take this pool cue<br> and these mittens, see?<br> If the gang ever caught me with those,<br> they'd run me out of town<br> hitched to a horse's tail or something.<br> Go on, go on, take 'em.

I got something<br> on my mind. Now, what was it?<br> - That's it. Where's the beer barrel?<br> - Over there.<br> Well, let's go to it.<br> We'll be seeing you around, boys.<br> - Hello, Harry!<br> - Hello, boy.<br> - Shake hands with Colonel Ruggles.<br> - I'm very glad to know you.<br> And Stella. Stella, Harry's wife.<br> Colonel Ruggles.<br> Get out, get out!<br> Oh, you're way in over your head there.<br> Well, Sourdough!<br> Hello, Hank, my boy.<br> Hank, I want you to meet my good<br> friend Colonel Ruggles. This is Hank.<br> - How are you, Colonel?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Egbert!<br> - Who's calling?<br> - Why, Nell! Yippee!<br> - Egbert, come here!<br> Ha-ha-ha! Pull out your anchor, Bill.<br> I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - Have a beer, Colonel.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Oh, you old darling!<br> Ha-ha! Nell Kenner,<br> you're a sight for sore eyes.<br> Aw, gee, Red Gap hasn't been the same<br> without you.<br> Aw, you're joshing me.<br> - There you are.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Oh, Jake.<br> Shake hands with Colonel Ruggles.<br> - Huh?<br> - Jake Henshaw, Colonel.<br> - The best newspaperman in the West.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Colonel? What army?<br> - The truth of the matter is that...<br> I got it. British army, of course.<br> - Now, what's your first name, Colonel?<br> - It isn't ever used.<br> - Oh, just for the paper.<br> - Come on.<br> Tell him your first name, Colonel.<br> Marmaduke.<br> No foolin'?<br> Well, anyhow,<br> how do you like our fair city?<br> Oh, toppin'.<br> - Like it, eh?<br> - I've never seen anything like it.<br> Well, have you met<br> any of our fair women?<br> I've not yet had that pleasure.<br> Well, come on and try some<br> of our fair food, Colonel.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Here we are.<br> Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles.<br> Oh, now wait a minute.<br> Let the old horse thief<br> tell about his trip in his own way.<br> Horse thief, she called me! You want<br> I should tell you in English or in French?<br> French.<br> Who said that?<br> You would.<br> It couldn't have been a little feller.<br> I say, who is responsible for this sauce?<br> Me.<br> Very excellent it is indeed,<br> my good woman.<br> If you're calling me a good woman cos<br> you don't know my name, it's Judson.<br> Delighted to make your acquaintance,<br> I'm sure.<br> - And who am I...<br> - Pardon me, Colonel.<br> I've got it up to "Colonel Marmaduke<br> Ruggles, British Army retired."<br> You're staying with the Flouds,<br> are you not?<br> - Yes, but only...<br> - Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.<br> - I'll see you a little later.<br> - I say!<br> Oh. So, you like my meat sauce,<br> do you?<br> It's very good. It's almost perfect.<br> What do you mean, almost perfect?<br> I was just thinking that perhaps a few<br> drops of this and a little bit of that<br> might make it<br> into a really superlative sauce.<br> So, that's what you're thinking, is it?<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> That I've been making meat sauce<br> for longer than I can remember,<br> and nobody's ever<br> found fault with it before.<br> I wasn't finding fault with it.<br> What do you mean by a few drops<br> of this and a little bit of that?<br> Oh, I only meant that perhaps<br> a little spice and some wine vinegar..<br> Listen, Colonel.<br> You'd better stick to something you<br> know about, like leading a regiment.<br> Let's not have<br> an international row about it.<br> Well...<br> Shall we dance?<br> Well, I really shouldn't.<br> I've got work to do.<br> Oh? Er...are you in service here?<br> If you mean do I work here, why, yes.<br> I always help Nell Kenner out<br> when she gives a party.<br> - Oh, I...<br> - I see what you mean.<br> A man in your position<br> wouldn't expect the help to dance,<br> but nobody minds here, Colonel.<br> It's funny,<br> but you're the first one that ever made<br> me feel different than anyone else.<br> Might I have the pleasure of this waltz?<br> Why, sure.<br> This is the newspaper office, isn't it?<br> And Mr Floud isn't there?<br> He's not there.<br> Has Mr Floud been there?<br> Are you sure<br> Mr Floud hasn't been there?<br> What? Why don't I try Nell Kenner's?<br> She's giving a beer bust?<br> What would my husband<br> be doing at a beer bust?<br> Drinking?<br> None of your lip, young man!<br> He's at the beer bust. Now there'll be<br> nothing in the paper tomorrow.<br> I'm surprised at Ruggles.<br> Well, you'd better get going.<br> And hurry. Hurry!<br> Just between us, Schwartzie,<br> what do you think?<br> I don't even like the buttonholes.<br> I know just how you feel, Schwartzie.<br> I tell you what I'm gonna do.<br> I'm gonna get rid of all these here dude<br> clothes and get me some new ones.<br> So, I want you to take an order<br> right now for ten suits.<br> - Ten suits?<br> - Yeah, and make 'em all checks.<br> - Checks?<br> - Yeah. Here, here, Bill!<br> That's, er...a little close<br> even for Red Gap!<br> He dances with finesse.<br> Colonel Ruggles, what did Mr Henshaw<br> say your first name is?<br> Oh, it's never used.<br> - Oh, what is it?<br> - You'd laugh at it.<br> No, I wouldn't.

What prompted you<br> to mingle with the guests?<br> Oh, sir, I had definite instructions<br> from Mr Floud, sir, to mix.<br> I'm sorry to spoil your pleasure.<br> But you must come home<br> with me at once.<br> I...I feel it incumbent upon me, sir,<br> to see if that coincides<br> with Mr Floud's wishes, sir.<br> Never mind Mr Floud. He can stay here.<br> You're coming with me.<br> I think I should speak to Mr Floud, sir.<br> I won't be kicked by a servant,<br> English or otherwise.<br> Are you still going to harbour the ruffian?<br> - He's an anarchist.<br> - He's an assassin.<br> I fail to see anything funny about it,<br> Mater.<br> You will! You will!<br> Quiet, Mother.<br> Ruggles, how could you do it?<br> I coarsely gave way to the brute in me.<br> Mr Belknap-Jackson is quite right.<br> Will you be quiet, Mother?<br> In Paris,<br> you led my poor husband astray.<br> And now you've started<br> assaulting the family.<br> Ruggles, you will have to go.<br> You mean, madam, that I am to be<br> turned loose in this remote settlement?<br> Remote settlement?<br> You see, Effie?<br> The man's quite impossible.<br> You'd better<br> pack your bags immediately.<br> Just a minute, Bill.<br> Before you go<br> throwing Bill out on his ear,<br> you'd better read this here piece<br> in the paper.<br> Oh.<br> Oh!<br> Oh!

That's it.<br> Now, Mrs Floud, look at the Colonel<br> and smile nicely, please.<br> Oh, a little better smile than that.<br> Oh, just a little better.<br> Now, Colonel, look at Mrs Floud.<br> Mrs Floud, look at the Colonel.<br> Now a big smile. Big. Big!<br> Oh, that's it!<br> I will ask you to drink to the health<br> of our distinguished guest of honour,<br> Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles.<br> I know we would all like to hear<br> some of Colonel Ruggles'<br> experiences in the British Army.<br> - No. Oh, no. No, no.<br> - No, no.<br> - I couldn't talk about my exploits.<br> - No.<br> - Oh, Effie, do make him talk.<br> - Oh, no. No, really.<br> You see, the Colonel spent many years<br> with the Black Watch in darkest Africa.<br> You...you were a Black Watchman,<br> weren't you, Colonel?<br> Ha-ha. Hm.<br> - Whoa.<br> - Why, Colonel Ruggles.<br> Good afternoon, Mrs Judson.<br> Whoa.<br> Oh, I say,<br> that print gown suits you no end.<br> - Oh, do you like it?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> What a spiffy little garden you have!<br> I suppose it would be expecting<br> too much to ask you in for tea?<br> Oh, I should say rather not.<br> Oh.<br> Mr Barker, stop! Come here!<br> Get out! Mr Barker!<br> Mr Barker! Out!<br> There. I'm so sorry.<br> You see, he's never seen<br> an English cowboy.<br> Cowboy?<br> Hm.<br> I say, what a snug little home you have.<br> Well, I just sort of fixed it up myself.<br> Did you?<br> - Oh! Goldfish.<br> - Oh!<br> I have always derived<br> intense satisfaction<br> from their silent companionship.<br> Oh, have you?<br> Oh, how quaint!<br> - Who is this?<br> - Oh, that was Elmo.<br> Mr Judson.<br> He got kicked by his favourite mule<br> and he never got over it.<br> Oh, excuse me, Colonel,<br> while I go and heat the water for the tea.<br> Oh, can't I help you?<br> It's hot.<br> - May I be of any assistance?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Men are so helpless in the kitchen.<br> Oh, no.<br> Always bring the pot to the kettle.<br> Never bring the kettle to the pot.<br> Listen, Colonel, I've been making tea<br> for longer than I can remember and...<br> Don't let's get into difficulties<br> about this.<br> But you must listen<br> to an Englishman about tea.<br> If it were coffee, I should be your pupil.<br> But we're making tea, and when making<br> tea, always bring the pot to the kettle<br> and never bring the kettle to the pot.<br> Oh, Colonel,<br> your knowledge is surprising.<br> I don't see why you should say<br> surprising, Mrs Judson.<br> The best cooks have always been men.<br> I myself have pronounced views as to<br> the preparation and serving of food.<br> - Have you?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Well, do you know something nice<br> that will go with tea?<br> Er...yes, yes. The ingredients are<br> quite simple too. Have you a little flour?<br> - Oh, would you, Colonel?<br> - Rather.<br> It, er...needs flour,<br> butter, milk, and salt.<br> Oh, Colonel,<br> you seem so at home in the kitchen.<br> Ah, Mrs Judson,<br> it would be difficult to describe<br> the intense satisfaction<br> I have always derived from cooking.<br> And goldfish.<br> Er...well, no, no.<br> Oh, Colonel,<br> you must write out this recipe for me.<br> Nothing would give me greater<br> pleasure, Mrs Judson. Dear me!<br> - You should open a restaurant.<br> - Hm.<br> He's back again! Down, sir! Down, sir!<br> - Mr Barker, out! Out! Out! Mr Barker!<br> - Down, sir! Down, sir! Down, sir!<br> Here. Get!<br> Oh...!<br> We're goin' out to the ranch<br> for a few days to get away from it all.<br> - Heh-heh! Ain't that right, Ma?<br> - That's the idea.<br> - All right, Nelly?<br> - This is Henry.<br> Yeah. Go on, Henry.<br> Enjoying yourself?<br> Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.<br> I've been taking the liberty<br> of reading again<br> the life of your great<br> American statesman, sir.<br> Oh?<br> You seem<br> in a very good mood yourself.<br> I am. It's a pleasure to tell you<br> that you're through.<br> - Did you say...<br> - You're fired, Ruggles.<br> Mrs Floud instructed me to pay<br> your railroad fare to San Francisco.<br> Yes, sir.<br> There's a train leaving at noon.<br> See that you're on it.<br> What? Train, sir? Train, sir? Yes, sir.<br> Er...train, sir.<br> Goodbye to you, sir.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> - Oh, it's late.<br> - Yeah.<br> Um...<br> Oh, in that case, could you tell me where<br> I could obtain an inexpensive meal?<br> Er...try the Silver Dollar.<br> They've a swell free lunch there.<br> Oh, thank you. Er...<br> could I deposit my luggage here?<br> Er...yeah, leave 'em there. I'll watch 'em.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hello, Colonel.<br> - How do you do?<br> - What'll you have?<br> - A small glass of beer, thank you.<br> - A small one, eh?<br> - How are you, Colonel?<br> - Howdy, Colonel.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How have you been?<br> - In excellent health, thank you.<br> Er...do you know,<br> I think I could do with a bite of food.<br> Oh, we have a fine lunch on today.<br> Right down here, Colonel.<br> - How's tricks?<br> - Oh, jolly.<br> Ah, them's nice pig's feet, Colonel.<br> Yes.<br> Hi, Bill! Look, Ma, here's Bill.<br> Come in here, you old lone wolf.<br> Oh, pardon me.<br> Tryin' to sneak one over on us, eh?<br> - Hi, Bill.<br> - Here, sit down, sit down.<br> I thought you'd departed<br> for the ranch, sir.<br> We just stopped in here first<br> for a little snort. Sit down.<br> This is very awkward, sir.<br> - What's he talking about?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Are you drunk, Colonel?<br> - Ye... Drunk? Heck, no.<br> I would like you to know that I have only<br> the kindliest feelings towards you both.<br> He's tight as a tick.<br> Ye... No, no, he ain't.<br> Come on, Bill, loosen up.<br> Now, what's gnawin' on you?<br> Yeah, I thought there was somethin'.<br> No longer require your services?<br> Belknap-Jackson!<br> Why, the sku... I'll cut out his windpipe!<br> - The sneakin' coyote!<br> - Why, look-a-here, Bill.<br> We wouldn't fire you<br> even if you looked like that feller.<br> I couldn't be happier, sir.<br> I couldn't be happier, madam.<br> Oh, yes, you could. Here, drink that.<br> Yeah, and follow it up with this.<br> I tell you, that Belknap-Jackson<br> is a Boston cream puff.<br> You're working for me, ain't you?<br> Oh, excuse me. I couldn't help but hear.<br> But I don't understand.<br> - Well, tell her, Ma.<br> - Come on and sit down.<br> Listen.<br> - No!<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> Then you're just an ord...<br> - Oh, this is wonderful news.<br> - Come have a drink.<br> No, I just came over<br> for some cooking sherry.<br> Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.<br> We'll all have one more shot and then<br> we'll move Bill back into the house.<br> - What do you say?<br> - No, sir.<br> - I'd rather not.<br> - Why not?<br> Well, sir, I can't go on<br> posing as what I'm not<br> and, er...I don't wish to remain<br> in service any longer, sir.<br> I want to make something of myself.<br> I would like to stand on my own two feet.<br> This is a land, sir, of great opportunity<br> where all are created equal.<br> There, that's...that's what I been...<br> Now you're talkin'.<br> Like Lincoln said that day at Gettysburg.<br> He hit the nail right on the nose<br> when he said...<br> Well, what did he say?<br> That's funny. I was gonna<br> ask you the same thing.<br> He, er... What did he say?<br> - I don't know. Do you?<br> - I don't know.<br> Er...he...he said...<br> - Hey, Sam!<br> - Yeah?<br> What did Lincoln say<br> that day at Gettysburg?<br> I don't know but I'll find out.<br> What did Lincoln say at Gettysburg?<br> I don't know.<br> Harry, what did Lincoln say<br> at Gettysburg?<br> I don't know, boss.<br> Hey, Curly,<br> what did Lincoln say at Gettysburg?<br> I don't recollect. Ask Hank.<br> He reads the newspapers.<br> - What did he say, Hank?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Ask the boys, will you?<br> - Sure.<br> - Try and find out for me, will you, Harry?<br> - Sure.<br> - Hey.<br> - Huh?<br> What did Lincoln say at Gettysburg?<br> I don't know. I wasn't there.<br> What did Lincoln say at Gettysburg?<br> I don't know. What did he say?<br> I was asking you.<br> You wasn't there!<br> - I couldn't find out.<br> - That dumb bunch don't know.<br> There's none of them there that knows.<br> What a fine bunch of Americans!<br> That's funny.<br> Four score<br> and seven years ago<br> our fathers brought forth,<br> on this continent, a new nation,<br> conceived in liberty and dedicated to the<br> proposition that all men are created equal.<br> Now we are engaged<br> in a great civil war...<br> Why, that's it.<br> Bill, don't tell me you know it.<br> - How does it go, Bill?<br> - Er...<br> "Four score and seven years ago<br> "our fathers brought forth,<br> on this continent, a new nation,<br> "conceived in liberty,<br> "and dedicated to the proposition<br> that all men are created equal.<br> "Now we are engaged in a great civil war,<br> "testing whether that nation, or any nation<br> so conceived, and so dedicated,<br> "can long endure.<br> "We are now on a great battlefield<br> of that war.<br> "We have come to dedicate<br> a portion of that field,<br> "as a final resting place<br> "for those who here gave their lives,<br> that that nation might live.<br> "It is altogether fitting and proper<br> that we should do this.<br> "But, in a larger sense, we cannot<br> dedicate, we cannot consecrate,<br> "we cannot hallow, this ground.<br> "The brave men, living and dead,<br> who struggled here,<br> "have consecrated it far beyond<br> our poor power to add or detract.<br> "The world will little note,<br> nor long remember what we say here,<br> "but it can never forget<br> what they did here.<br> "It is for us the living, rather, to be<br> dedicated here to the unfinished work<br> "which they who fought here<br> have thus far so nobly advanced.<br> "It is rather for us to be here dedicated<br> to the great task remaining before us,<br> "that from these honoured dead we take<br> increased devotion to that cause<br> "for which they gave<br> the last full measure of devotion,<br> "that we here highly resolve that<br> these dead shall not have died in vain...<br> "...that this nation, under God,<br> shall have a new birth of freedom,<br> "and that government of the people,<br> by the people, and for the people,<br> "shall not perish from the earth."<br> I'll buy a drink.<br> Here's to Colonel Ruggles!<br> Here, here!<br> Well, I'll tell you, Bill,<br> we already got a president,<br> but any time you want to run for mayor<br> or sheriff or something like that,<br> you just let me know.<br> I'm not ambitious for public office, sir.<br> Bill, what are you figuring on doing<br> besides standing on your own two feet?<br> I keep telling him<br> he should open a restaurant.<br> - Great!<br> - Say, that ain't a bad idea.<br> We ain't never had a decent hash house<br> here in Red Gap.<br> And I'll stake you<br> to the best location in town for it.<br> - I beg your pardon, madam?<br> - It won't cost you a nickel.<br> I own the building.<br> There was a Chinaman tried to run<br> a chop suey joint there and they shot him.<br> He couldn't cook ham and eggs. He was<br> always doin' something Chinese to 'em.<br> I could help you in the kitchen. I'll even<br> let you help me with my meat sauce.<br> How...how much cash<br> you figure it would take, Bill?<br> If I might say so, you're all a bit of OK.<br> Well, you...you're more than that.<br> Doggone it! Let's have a drink<br> to the new beanery.<br> Well...well, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> What...what'll we call it?<br> - Er...<br> - Yes.<br> - Er...<br> - Um...<br> - Er...<br> - Er...<br> How about calling it The Busy Bee?<br> No, no.<br> - The Mustang Grotto.<br> - No, no.<br> I think it should be something nice<br> like Ye Olde English Tavern.<br> No, no.<br> Look, look, look. I got it, I got it.<br> The Golden Horse Chop House.<br> No.<br> Why? Why? Can't you just see a golden<br> horse squattin' up there on the roof?<br> No, no, no!<br> Er...might I suggest<br> The Anglo-American Grill?<br> - Um...<br> - Not bad, huh?<br> - I like it.<br> - What do you think, Egbert?<br> Well, it's all right but I still think it<br> ought to be called a horse's something.<br> No, no, no.<br> - Hello, Belknap.<br> - Effie.<br> Here's a letter from Lord Burnstead.<br> It just arrived this noon.<br> Oh, dear George.<br> Dear, dear George. Yes.<br> Oh! He's coming here.<br> He's coming here to visit us!<br> - He's coming here?<br> - Yes. Yes, yes.<br> He's going to take Ruggles<br> back with him.<br> Oh.<br> The Earl of Burnstead our house guest.<br> My supreme triumph in Red Gap.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Ruggles is gone.<br> - What?<br> - He's on his way to San Francisco.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I...I discharged him.<br> You discharged him? You...<br> Oh, you couldn't.<br> You...you... How dare you?<br> - What can we do?<br> - What can we do?<br> What can we do?<br> Oh, what can we do?<br> What can...<br> Oh, I'm going to faint.<br> Oh, no. No, I'm not.<br> I'm going to find Egbert.<br> It's a mess, isn't it?<br> It's wonderful.<br> Well, I don't see<br> anything wonderful about it.<br> - You don't?<br> - No.<br> You don't?<br> My father was a gentleman's gentleman,<br> and his father before him.<br> And from that heritage of service,<br> miraculously, there comes a man,<br> a person of importance, however small,<br> a man whose decisions<br> and whose future are in his own hands.<br> It's wonderful, isn't it?<br> Restaurant?<br> Ruggles opening a restaurant?<br> Yeah, where<br> the chop suey joint used to be.<br> Well, of course he's not going to do<br> anything of the sort.<br> Whoever suggested<br> such a horrible idea?<br> Hey, Ma! Old man Schwartz certainly<br> did a good job on the suit, didn't he?<br> Oh, hello, Effie.<br> Ye Gods and little prairie dogs!<br> Where in... Where did you get<br> that horse blanket?<br> Now, look-a-here, Effie,<br> this is a man's suit and I aim to wear it!<br> - Where are your good clothes?<br> - They're all gone.<br> Egbert Floud, take off those clothes.<br> No, sir, I won't do it.<br> - Take off those clothes!<br> - No, sir, I won't do it!<br> Effie, we might just as well have<br> a showdown right here and now.<br> What did Lincoln say at Gettysburg?<br> Yeah, you don't know. Well, I'll tell you.<br> He said that all men are created equal.<br> He didn't just mean a few men.<br> He meant all men, and that includes me.<br> I'm created equal.<br> - Equal to what?<br> - Equal...equal to what?<br> Well, equal to...<br> She changed the subject on me.<br> Er... men are created equal to women!<br> That's why you have no right<br> to order me around the way you do.<br> Abe Lincoln said so.<br> He also said you can fool some<br> of the people some of the time,<br> and all of the people some of the time.<br> But you can't fool me,<br> Egbert Floud, any of the time!<br> You striped bass!<br> Effie!<br> Oh, no. I say, you mustn't do that.<br> No, no, no, no. No, no.<br> You mustn't do that. Let me.<br> - Ruggles!<br> - Yes, madam?<br> Lord Burnstead. He's coming.<br> Here. Here's his letter.<br> - Coming here, madam?<br> - Yes, yes. Isn't it glorious?<br> Of course, I shall be simply frantic<br> arranging dinners, parties and receptions<br> but I'm depending on you, Ruggles.<br> - What are you doing? Are you busy?<br> - Yes, rather, madam.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> The...the restaurant.<br> The chop-suey joint<br> you were going to open.<br> Well, of course,<br> that's out of the question now.<br> It was a silly idea to begin with.<br> Oh, but here I am wasting time<br> and...and dear George apt<br> to pop in on us any moment.<br> Oh, Ruggles, you don't know<br> what this means to me. Au revoir!<br> Au revoir!<br> Well, he's coming to get me.<br> You're not gonna let him, are you?<br> I suppose he needs me.<br> You mean you're gonna give up all this<br> just to keep him buttoned up?<br> What has he ever done for you?<br> Well, he did let me down<br> but I'd be the first member of my family<br> ever to let his family down.<br> And I'd have you know, Mrs Judson,<br> that it isn't just keeping a man<br> buttoned up, it's heredity and loyalty,<br> and I suppose you could call it habit<br> if you wanted to.<br> I'd hate to tell you what I'd call it.<br> Why don't you practise<br> what you been preaching?<br> First I find you're not a colonel<br> and now I find you're not a man.<br> Maybe you'd better find out<br> what you are.<br> Oh, I feel like jumping in the river.<br> Well, go ahead and jump.<br> And jump in at the bend.<br> It's deeper there.<br> Now, let me see. Let me see.<br> The Earl of Burnstead on my right,<br> of course. Er...who's next to him?<br> - Judy Ballard.<br> - Absolutely not. No, we'll put her...<br> Way down in the slums<br> at my end of the table.<br> Has anybody seen anything of Ruggles?<br> Not a sign of him.<br> - You didn't fire him again, did you?<br> - I did not.<br> I looked all over town for him,<br> everywhere.<br> Oh, he couldn't desert me like this<br> in my hour of need.<br> Do you realise I don't even know<br> how to introduce my guest of honour?<br> There's the doorbell.<br> They're arriving too early.<br> - I'll tell them.<br> - You'll do nothing of the sort.<br> I'll bet a dollar Lord Burnstead<br> hasn't got his shirt on yet.<br> Bit of a problem, isn't it?<br> Yeah, what?<br> Well, we can't very well go downstairs<br> without our ties being tied, can we?<br> - Yeah, no, no, we can't.<br> - Mm.<br> Maybe...<br> maybe we can't go downstairs at all.<br> Um...no. Beastly bores, receptions,<br> aren't they? Tedious, I mean.<br> - I don't like 'em, do you?<br> - Well, they don't bother me none.<br> - No?<br> - No, I never go to 'em.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - I'm...I'm what they call agile.<br> Agile?<br> Oh! Oh, you...you mean agile, huh?<br> Yeah. Yeah, that's right.<br> - Admiral, come here a minute.<br> - Yes.<br> Now, er...take a look<br> at this here window.<br> Looks just like an ordinary window<br> at first glance, doesn't it?<br> - You're right.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Did you ever have occasion<br> to, er...climb out of a window?<br> Oh, yes. Hm.<br> - See what you can do with this one.<br> - Ah.<br> Oh, I hate to leave that<br> but we may bump into another later, eh?<br> - Take her easy, now. Take her easy.<br> - Yes.<br> You, er...you'll find a hole in the wall<br> for your foot. I put it there myself.<br> Yes. Yes, I found it.<br> Come right in, girls.<br> Put your things down here.<br> All right, thank you.<br> Is my hair all right?<br> Yes, that's very good.<br> Now, how about mine?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry we were late.<br> - It...it's quite all right.<br> If you'll go right in, I...<br> I'll join you in just a moment.<br> There seems to be something<br> the matter with these drapes.<br> Cheyenne, Cheyenne, hop on my pony<br> There's room here for two, dear<br> But after the ceremony<br> We'll both ride back...<br> I hope that wasn't the drinks.<br> - It was.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Oh, Miss Kenner,<br> I'm so sorry this happened,<br> but I'm so nervous<br> I could jump right out of my skin.<br> Well, don't worry about a few glasses.<br> Oh, it isn't that. It's Mr Ruggles.<br> I just know something's happened<br> to him, something fatal.<br> Oh, nonsense. He'll show up.<br> But I'm just not myself.<br> You see what I mean?<br> - Here I am. Hi, Nell.<br> - Why, Egbert!<br> - Where's your coat?<br> - Effie wanted me to wear it.<br> But I'll tell you later<br> how I got out of it.<br> I want you to meet somebody.<br> Come on in here, George.<br> Nell, I want you to meet<br> my poker-playing friend Earl Burnstead.<br> - How do you do?<br> - This is Nell Kenner.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Yeah, Earl is a lord.<br> Ain't that right, Lord?<br> Yeah, but you can call him George<br> for short.<br> And I want you two to get acquainted.<br> You know, Nell, make him feel at home.<br> Because he ain't quite used to our ways,<br> and over where he come from...<br> Er... Oh, heck.<br> I guess it's the same the world over.<br> Give me a drink, somebody.<br> Er...this is a frightful intrusion,<br> isn't it?<br> Oh, not at all. Isn't Mrs Floud<br> giving you a dinner tonight?<br> Yes. Oh, yes.<br> Oh, I...I see your point.<br> Well, you see, I...<br> Well, you can see for yourself<br> my tie isn't right.<br> Oh, isn't that too bad?<br> Shall I tie it for you?<br> - Oh, I say, would you really?<br> - Of course.<br> Oh, I say, isn't this nice?<br> Is this your first visit to America,<br> Lord Burnstead?<br> Huh? Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> I was thinking of something else. I...<br> You're remarkably like a girl I know.<br> I can't remember her name.<br> - Hm?<br> - Yes. You don't know it, I suppose?<br> - No.<br> - No, I suppose not.<br> She's...she's the most beautiful girl<br> in England.<br> There.<br> I'm afraid that's the best I can do.<br> Oh, it's first-rate, really.<br> Thanks awfully.<br> I say, do...do you believe<br> in love at first sight?<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> - Do you?<br> - No.<br> That's why I'd like to stay<br> a little while, if I may.<br> - What?<br> - Come on in.<br> Fascinating,<br> your American rhythm, isn't it?<br> Yes, isn't it?<br> It's ready.<br> Oh. Shall we eat?<br> Er...no, I'd rather try this again,<br> if you don't mind.<br> - All right.<br> - Yes.<br> Everybody loves a baby<br> That's why I'm in love with you<br> Pretty baby, boom...<br> - Why did you say boom?<br> - There's a boom there.<br> - Oh, is there? Oh.<br> - You don't seem to understand.<br> - Say it once with me.<br> - Yes.<br> Everybody loves a baby,<br> that's why I'm in love with you.<br> Pretty baby, boom. Pretty baby, boom.<br> - That's right.<br> - I see. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.<br> Everybody loves a baby<br> That's why I'm in love with you<br> - Pretty baby<br> - Boom...<br> No, you do it on the drum.<br> Huh? Of course. How stupid of me.<br> - Yes.<br> - Huh?<br> Everybody loves a baby<br> That's why I'm in love with you<br> Pretty baby...<br> Pretty baby...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - What?<br> - There's another one there.<br> - Oh. Oh, a ditto?<br> - Yes, a ditto boom.<br> - Oh, I like that.<br> - You like what?<br> - A ditto boom.<br> Ditto boom. Ditto boom.<br> Ditto boom, boom, boom.<br> Oh, let's eat.<br> What? No, I'd rather ditto boom,<br> if you don't mind.<br> - All right, we'll ditto boom.<br> - That's fine, that's fine.<br> Everybody loves a baby<br> That's why I'm in love with you<br> Pretty baby...<br> I'd like to be your sister, brother<br> Dad and mother too, pretty baby...<br> Popping in everywhere.<br> Pretty baby...<br> Won't you come and let me rock you<br> In my cradle of love...<br> That was my own idea.<br> I know it.<br> Oh, I want a lovin' baby<br> And it might as well be you...<br> - Oh, would that be asking too much?<br> - Why, of course not, no.<br> - I mean two booms.<br> - Oh, I see. Yes.<br> Oh, I want a lovin' baby<br> And it might as well be you...<br> Oh.<br> Oh, was that your drum?<br> You couldn't sew it up, I don't suppose?<br> No. Oh.<br> Buy a new one, will you?<br> Buy two, one for me.<br> I'm sure Lord Burnstead will forgive us<br> for not waiting for him any longer.<br> He'll join us, I know,<br> just as soon as he's finished<br> his conversation on the telephone,<br> which I'm sure must be terribly important.<br> Possibly a...a message from the King<br> or possibly from the, er...<br> Mayor of Canada.<br> Er...possibly.<br> Well, shall we begin?<br> Why not?<br> Go on, pitch in.<br> You come on in here<br> where you can't spill drinks all over me.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry but I'm just not myself.<br> Now, you sit down and tell me<br> what's the matter. Come on.<br> Oh, I don't see how they can go on<br> having a good time<br> when maybe he's... Oh, you know.<br> - Who? What are you talking about?<br> - Colonel Ruggles.<br> I think he jumped in the river.<br> No! Why should he want to do that?<br> Oh, on account of a woman.<br> She treated him something awful.<br> - Who told you that?<br> - I was there.<br> Oh, she said some terrible things to him<br> and I just know that...<br> - Why, say, this is serious!<br> - That's what I say.<br> Well, we gotta get busy right away.<br> - Oh, will you?<br> - Well, yes, I'll round up the boys.<br> Hey, fellers, look-a-here!<br> Get on your hats and coats.<br> I got something for you to do.<br> - It is a ghost! Oh, you didn't do it!<br> - Colonel Ruggles is missin'!<br> Follow me.<br> We'll get going right away. I...<br> Er...well, the searching party's off.<br> Look-a-here, Bill, what's the idea<br> of wanderin' around scarin' women?<br> I thought the Indians had got you,<br> Ruggles. Glad to see you.<br> I am glad to see you, my lord.<br> I'm sorry I wasn't at the station<br> to meet you, my lord.<br> That's all right.<br> Er...might I have a word<br> with you alone, my lord?<br> Why, I should think so. Why not?<br> Come on, old timer,<br> let's leave them alone.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - Get them a drink.<br> She tells me he's in the river<br> and he ain't even wet.<br> Something wrong, Ruggles?<br> I've had a terrible day,<br> my lord, a...a terrific fight.<br> - Oh. Were you outnumbered?<br> - An even match, my lord.<br> - A woman?<br> - No, my lord. I was fighting with myself.<br> - Did you win?<br> - A decisive victory, my lord.<br> Oh, stout feller!<br> I didn't think you had it in you.<br> Er...you'll find me rather a changed man,<br> my lord.<br> I don't know quite how to tell you<br> but here in Red Gap<br> I am considered important.<br> Quite a personage.<br> Yes, Colonel Ruggles, isn't it?<br> Yes, my lord. Colonel Marmaduke<br> Ruggles of the Coldstream Guards.<br> - A horrible mistake, my lord.<br> - Quite, if there should be a war.<br> Yes.<br> Nevertheless, my lord,<br> when people think you are someone,<br> you begin to think you are.<br> That's what I've been fighting about<br> with myself all day, my lord.<br> Am I someone or am I not?<br> Well, I only just got here,<br> you see, so I wouldn't know.<br> Oh, I am someone, my lord.<br> Oh, let me be the first to congratulate<br> you. How did you ever find it out?<br> Ah. You recollect<br> an Abraham Lincoln, my lord?<br> Oh, yes, fellow with the cherry tree.<br> - Er...no, my lord.<br> - Er...no?<br> At any rate, my lord, I am genuinely<br> sorry to have to tell you<br> that I shall not be returning with you<br> to London, I am remaining in Red Gap.<br> Oh, now, wait a minute, Ruggles.<br> It's no use, my lord.<br> My mind is made up.<br> I am entering trade,<br> my lord, a restaurant.<br> Oh, it's no good for you, Ruggles.<br> You haven't got the background for trade.<br> Nevertheless, my lord, I intend to try.<br> Oh, I never knew you to be<br> so obstinate before, really.<br> Still, something tells me<br> that we'll be back in London.<br> - Oh, excuse me. Here are your drinks.<br> - Oh. Hm.<br> Well, here's to London.<br> Here is to The Anglo-American Grill,<br> my lord.<br> Ha-ha. Yes.<br> Oh!<br> Mm, we should be all right.<br> Ready in ten minutes.<br> - Oh, they love your meat sauce.<br> - You mean our meat sauce.<br> Because I added a few drops of this<br> and a little bit of that.<br> Did you?<br> - Colonel, are we dressed all right?<br> - Indeed, yes, sir.<br> Table for four.<br> Thank you. Hello.<br> - Hello, Egbert!<br> - Hello, George!<br> - You remember Effie, boys.<br> - Howdy, Effie!<br> Make way for a lady,<br> you laughing hyenas!<br> You're losing your petticoat, Ma!<br> Hey, Sourdough,<br> where did you get the lid?<br> From Paris, France! Ain't it terrible?<br> Hold onto that hat.<br> It cost me 20 dollars.<br> Hello, Maude. Hello, Frank.<br> - Hello...why, hello, Fred!<br> - Howdy, Sourdough.<br> - How's everything? Hello, Soph.<br> - How are you?<br> Well, Bill, you're kinda dressed up,<br> ain't you?<br> Hello, Bill.<br> Where do you want us to squat?<br> Heh-heh. Yeah, ain't Bill<br> movin' around, though, huh?<br> Oh, Effie, where is Lord Burnstead?<br> He must have been delayed.<br> He's a very busy man, you know.<br> - Ruggles.<br> - Yes, madam?<br> Where's Lord Burnstead?<br> I understood he was coming with you,<br> madam.<br> He was but he didn't.<br> I can't understand it.<br> Lord Burnstead probably didn't care<br> to come to a place like this.<br> A nice party this is going to be,<br> without our guest of honour.<br> You don't know where George is,<br> do you?<br> - Who, George?<br> - Shh.<br> George? No, I ain't seen George all day.<br> No, the left-hand side.<br> Look-a-here, Effie, you're<br> taking this thing too much to heart.<br> Try a little of our meat sauce, sir.<br> Haven't you any catsup?<br> Oh, never mind. I'll eat when I get home.<br> What you want is...<br> what you want is...is...<br> some more of this imprisoned laughter<br> of the pleasant maids of France.<br> - What's wrong now?<br> - Nothing wrong with the food.<br> What happened?<br> I suppose it's wrong to hate anybody,<br> but I dislike Belknap-Jackson very much.<br> I'm gonna get you<br> something for your nerves.<br> - No, my nerves are quite all right.<br> - Oh, but I am.<br> No, I'm all right.<br> Oh, Effie?<br> Where can Lord Burnstead be?<br> I told you he's a very busy man.<br> He's a man of affairs.<br> - Have a good time.<br> - Thanks a lot, old man.<br> Oh, Effie?<br> - Hi, Nell!<br> - Hello, Egbert!<br> Hello, Nell! Well, Admiral!<br> Say, where have you been?<br> - Effie's been looking for you.<br> - Oh, dear. I'm sorry.<br> - Dear, oh, dear! I'm so sorry.<br> - Yeah, sit down, sit down, Bill.<br> - I have no excuse at all.<br> - No?<br> No. It...it must have been<br> the excitement, probably.<br> - Excitement?<br> - Yes.<br> Do you believe in love at first sight?<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> - No, no.<br> Neither did we but, er...<br> Darling, just a minute.<br> I mean, look. You see?<br> Well, you old mossback, you.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you, old boy.<br> What's the matter with you, Nell?<br> You been losing your mind?<br> - She's going to be my countess.<br> - She's going to be a countess!<br> - Sit down, won't you? Come on!<br> - Yeah, Bill, let's have another chair.<br> Sit right down here, Admiral. And, Nell,<br> you sit right next to him there.<br> This is gonna be my party<br> on account of my knowing Nell<br> longer than anybody here.<br> - Oh, Egbert?<br> - Yes.<br> Egbert, I'm going to be<br> matron of honour<br> and we're gonna have<br> the wedding at our house.<br> - Oh, sure.<br> - Aren't we?<br> Oh!<br> Making a countess<br> of a cheap dancer!<br> I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.<br> - You what?<br> - I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.<br> You're insulting, Ruggles.<br> I beg your pardon,<br> but you were insulting, sir.<br> Not only were you insulting<br> but you were eavesdropping.<br> - That was quite unintentional, sir.<br> - You're lying, Ruggles.<br> - I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.<br> - I've stood enough from you.<br> Aren't you forgetting that you are nothing<br> but a low, common shiner of boots?<br> I'm not forgetting<br> that I am proprietor of this place<br> and as proprietor of this place<br> I am politely asking you to leave, sir.<br> - You what?<br> - I'm asking you to leave.<br> If I go, all the real people<br> will leave with me.<br> If my success depends upon<br> catering to people like you, sir,<br> all I can say is...<br> all I can say is, Mr Belknap-Jackson...<br> all I can say is words fail me.<br> - Ruggles! How dare you?<br> - It's quite all right, sir.<br> - You can't...you can't do this to me!<br> - Quite all right, sir.<br> - This is disgraceful.<br> - Oh, sit down.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I'd like to say a few words to you<br> about the proprietor Mr Ruggles.<br> - So, I'm a failure?<br> - Oh, don't worry about it.<br> As I always say,<br> it's always darkest before the dawn<br> and every cloud has a silver lining<br> and it never rains but what...<br> Oh.<br> - And I'm not worrying about it.<br> - Oh, yes, you are. Just look at you.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow...<br> Well, they seem to love His Lordship.<br> His Lordship's a very happy man tonight.<br> He's marrying Nell Kenner. Yeah.<br> Hey! Hey, Bill! Bill, come on,<br> get in on this, will you? Come on.<br> Heh-heh! This is the biggest show<br> Red Gap ever had.<br> He's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> Which nobody can deny...<br> Which nobody can deny<br> Which nobody can deny...<br> Why, you old plate of soup,<br> they're singing it for you!<br> What?<br> My friends.<br> God bless you all.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> And so say all of us<br> And so say all of us<br> And so say all of us<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> Which nobody can deny<br> Which nobody can deny<br> Which nobody can deny<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> Which nobody can deny<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> And so say all of us<br> And so say all of us<br> And so say all of us<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow...<br>
