Ship.<br> We didn't know who you were, so<br> we kind of patched you up ourselves.<br> You had an edema<br> of the upper tracheal track.<br> Rudi, I've been waiting<br> two months for this moment.<br> Don't mess it up for me<br> by letting him drown.<br> - Yes, admiral.<br> - Diver up!<br> In five, counting,<br> four, three, two, one.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> may I introduce to you<br> after a 772-year engagement<br> on the bottom of the ocean:<br> King Bateen!<br> Nice job, everyone.<br> Except you, Al. What the hell?<br> It's a 10-ton-rated winch,<br> my friend, not a fly-fishing rod.<br> You know what? You're thinking<br> of the Thompson 12-91.<br> Whereas you're astride a 12-93.<br> - Not that you could operate either one.<br> - Boys!<br> - Sir?<br> - Sir?<br> The king meets the people<br> at the museum in five hours.<br> - Don't worry, sir.

The wife.<br> - Come on, ladies,<br> get Mr. Bateen unhooked.<br> Clean him up.<br> We got a party to go to.<br> - Admiral?<br> - Retired.<br> - Jim Sandecker.<br> - Eva. Eva Rojas.<br> I'm with the WHO.<br> You look like you could use<br> a cup of coffee.<br> - Hey, Dirk. Hey, I need your help.<br> - What?<br> - Is it left over right, or right over left?<br> - This better not be like last time.<br> I can't remember.<br> It's driving me nuts.<br> Is there something about a rabbit<br> going around a tree or something?<br> I'll be there in an hour.<br> - What, Dirk?<br> - That was Oshodi.<br> He thinks he might<br> have found something.<br> Oh, that's great. That is fantastic.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - No, no, no, no, fantastic for me.<br> I can't wait to tell Sandecker that you're<br> not gonna be at the museum tonight<br> because one of your contacts<br> from the Nigerian underworld<br> has found evidence of a Civil War<br> ironclad shipwrecked<br> - In a storm off Africa. Yeah, right.<br> - Storm off Africa.<br> That's what you're talking about, right?<br> Yeah. Sandecker's gonna freak.<br> - Look, Al...<br> - And I'll be there. He'll turn all red.<br> The fox chases the rabbit around<br> the tree and down the hole.<br> That's how the tie works.<br> Don't you worry, I'll be there.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> First, I'd like to thank the Lagos<br> museum for this magnificent reception.<br> I would also like to thank<br> our primary benefactor on this project,<br> Yves Massarde.<br> Thank you.<br> We are NUMA,<br> the National Underwater<br> and Marine Agency.<br> And this, ladies and gentlemen,<br> is what we do.<br> King Bateen.<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's not at the buffet.<br> - Damn it.<br> - Do you want another kebab?<br> With the help of museums,<br> with the help of governments,<br> private organizations like ours<br> can work in partnership<br> to make sure that history,<br> history that has been lost<br> to the tides of time,<br> can be returned to its people.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Have a lovely evening.<br> Do you have a CD burner<br> on that ship of yours?<br> Yes, the same one I bought<br> from you last month.<br> I have a wonderful piece, straight<br> from the Iraqi National Museum.<br> Don't show me things like that,<br> Oshodi. We're not that friendly.<br> Okay, okay. Now, here it is.<br> A very special piece.<br> The one I spoke to you about.<br> It breaks my heart<br> just to show it to you.<br> Where did you get this?<br> Cash, please.<br> We are not that friendly.<br> This is a great party.<br> - Thank you for inviting us, admiral.<br> - The pleasure is mine.<br> Yves, this is the woman<br> I was telling you about,<br> - Dr. Eva Rojas.<br> - Hi.<br> I'm delighted to make your<br> acquaintance. I'm Yves Massarde.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> This is Dr. Frank Hopper.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Yves does a lot of business<br> in Africa.<br> Some even in Mali.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> I understand you believe there is some<br> sort of plague coming out of Mali?<br> We don't like to say "plague."<br> - What do you think it is then?<br> - A plague.<br> So you do business in Mali?<br> Do you know anyone there<br> who could help us<br> by pressuring the WHO<br> to send a team?<br> Well, you see, much of Mali<br> is controlled by a warlord.<br> General Kazim. Do you know him?<br> Yes. He used to be a colonel<br> in the Malian army,<br> and gave himself an upgrade<br> the day he shot the president.<br> He's the man who put the "war"<br> back into "warlord."<br> And he controls the country?<br> Half of it. And the other half<br> no one controls,<br> but I don't know which is worse.<br> But I have to warn you, it is very<br> dangerous for foreigners right now.<br> I would say it's probably<br> more dangerous for locals.<br> Yes, but your death would<br> look very bad in the papers.<br> So does the word "plague."<br> All right, I will call some people,<br> but at the end of the day,<br> I'm just a businessman,<br> so be patient.<br> Oh, yeah, she's good at that.<br> He's not gonna help us.<br> This was a waste of time.<br> Eva, we can't just wander into<br> the middle of a Malian civil war.<br> The fighting with the Tuaregs<br> is too severe. You know that.<br> I think we should go back<br> to the hospital...<br> Admiral, have you ever seen<br> a Confederate gold dollar?<br> - Dear God, don't start this again.<br> - Of course not.<br> The Confederacy never made<br> a gold dollar.<br> The mint was destroyed<br> near the end of the war.<br> Dirk, I beg you on my hands<br> and knees. Don't.<br> But not before Jefferson Davis<br> had five samples made.<br> He gave four of those samples<br> to his top generals:<br> - Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Johnston.<br> - Every time we come to Africa,<br> out comes that stupid ship model.<br> Out come the old port journals.<br> We are leaving for Australia<br> tomorrow.<br> Four of those samples<br> have been found.<br> But the fifth never was.<br> That one was given to<br> an old family friend of Davis.<br> A brilliant young sea captain<br> named Mason Tombs.<br> Captain of the CSS ironclad Texas.<br> - Where in the hell did you get this?<br> - Frederick Oshodi.<br> And he got it from a man<br> named Indigwe.<br> But the important thing is that Indigwe<br> found this in Labbezanga, Mali.<br> Hey, my dad collects coins.<br> No, that coin and the Texas<br> were on the Niger River.<br> It's impossible. An ironclad<br> couldn't make it with her draft.<br> Let me take the Calliope<br> to Labbezanga, have a look around.<br> - You can't have my boat, Dirk.<br> - Three days, admiral.<br> Just three days. Imagine.<br> Imagine.<br> All right, if I strike out,<br> you'll never hear another word<br> about this.<br> You got 72 hours.<br> And not a nanosecond more.<br> You fellas just bought<br> yourself a boat trip.<br> You're a gentleman, admiral.<br> I don't care what they say about you.<br> I got a bottle says we never find it.<br> - Make it a case.<br> - All right. You're on.<br> - Okay, I'll see you later.<br> - See you later.<br> Hey, yo!<br> - You're late.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - I was told 8:00 departure.<br> - Eight o'clock?<br> - I never said 8:00.<br> - I said 9.<br> - Nine.<br> - It's after 1 0.<br> Who said 8?<br> Admiral Sandecker.<br> Yeah, he said to give him a call<br> if you had any problems.<br> A problem? With what?<br> He wants you to take us<br> up the river to Mali.<br> - What?<br> - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<br> - Taking you to Mali?<br> - Wait.<br> There's been an outbreak in Mali.<br> - It's going to become an epidemic.<br> - And you wanna hitch a ride, doctor?<br> What, WHO's making<br> budgetary cutbacks?<br> Please. It's important.<br> - You guys got enough gear?<br> - Probably not.<br> Small boat. No privacy.<br> I'm not shy.<br> Where do you call home?<br> I have a house in Monterey,<br> but I'm never there.<br> Monterey. There's great diving<br> in Monterey.<br> Is that all you ever think about?<br> Diving?<br> No. Sometimes I think about<br> Petricola pholadiformis.<br> The angel wing clam.<br> - Beautiful.<br> - Yeah.<br> This river's the only place<br> on earth they're found.<br> When they're underwater,<br> they glow in the dark.<br> Now, the amazing thing is that<br> modern science cannot explain why.<br> There must be a reason.<br> Till then, my theory is that<br> they do it because they can.<br> Dirk! That's it. Let's go.<br> Angel wings.<br> World would be a lot cooler place<br> if more of us were like that, huh?<br> This is the center of the cluster.<br> Here. Asselar.<br> That's where we have to go.<br> Right in the middle<br> of Kazim's civil war.<br> Hey, you ever been<br> after marlins, doctors?<br> Oh, no, not<br> the marlin story again, Al.<br> Seven hundred<br> and thirty-three pounds.<br> Five and a half hours<br> in the fighting chair.<br> - I thought it was 600 pounds.<br> - Hey!<br> What did you catch that day?<br> I can't remember anything at all.<br> How long you guys been together?<br> Oh, since kindergarten.<br> College. Navy. NUMA.<br> Poor guy's always<br> been in my shadow.<br> Always the Al's-maid, never the Al.<br> Right?<br> Nice, doc.<br> You're pulling your weight.<br> - My watch, chief.<br> - All right, my man. Excellent.<br> Your friend Al told me all about<br> your Captain Tombs and his boat.<br> Oh, he did, did he?<br> He also said ironclads were<br> not made to cross the ocean.<br> Well, neither was man. Tequila?<br> And you found a coin?<br> Not just a coin.<br> I found the coin.<br> Now, I also have a letter<br> from the captain's widow<br> alluding to her husband's<br> urgent Eastern voyage.<br> I have a sailor's log<br> on an Atlantic clipper<br> who swears on a stack of Bibles<br> he saw a great iron beast<br> steaming two miles<br> off the African coast.<br> Now, what kind of man tries to take<br> a ship like that across the ocean?<br> Why? How?<br> I don't know.<br> But I plan on finding out.<br> Al loves it when people ask me that,<br> thinks it makes me look a bit:<br> This must be nice.<br> To have this as your office.<br> Well, every great thing that's ever<br> happened to me<br> happened in the water.<br> Every one.<br> Hey, Rudi, come on,<br> help me out with this.<br> Oumar.<br> - You got it?<br> - There you go.<br> - How long to Asselar?<br> - Oh, six, eight hours. No problem.<br> - You stay for long?<br> - No, not long.<br> All right, this one too.<br> - Think it'll be safe?<br> - Oh, it's okay.<br> Where we go now,<br> no fighting. No problem.<br> - Yeah, no problem.<br> - No Tuareg.<br> Listen, I've been thinking.<br> When this is over,<br> there's a place I know.<br> It's called Monterey.<br> - Never heard of it.<br> - No?<br> It's got a beautiful beach.<br> Golden sands, aqua-blue surf.<br> The place is paradise.<br> - Sounds good.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I also happen to know a woman<br> who has a house there.<br> And because she's a workaholic,<br> she's never at home.<br> Now, I haven't asked her, but I'm<br> pretty sure that she wouldn't mind<br> if you dropped by.<br> Can I bring a friend?<br> You'd have to ask her.<br> I already did.<br> You did?<br> You, me and the bay of Monterey.<br> Thank you for everything.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - And good luck to you.<br> You as well. Bonne route, doctor.<br> Mr. Indigwe, he lives...<br> Indigwe. He find this<br> one week before, yes?<br> You know, I'm not<br> too much of a linguist...<br> ...but that didn't sound too good.<br> Indigwe is dead.<br> Yeah. Hey, the check.<br> What is "the check"? L'addition,<br> Hey, you know, my dad<br> collected ancient coins.<br> From Rome, China, Siam, Persia.<br> Somehow they all ended up<br> in a shoebox in New Jersey.<br> - Meaning?<br> - Coins travel, Dirk.<br> Even if that poor guy was still alive,<br> it could have been nothing.<br> Yeah, but the coin traveled<br> from somewhere, Al.<br> And unless it hitched a ride<br> on the back of a dolphin,<br> I'm gonna guess that<br> its jumping-off point<br> was a little bit closer<br> to where we're sitting.<br> Really, you can see that ironclad<br> steaming up the river? I mean, really?<br> Isn't it more likely that we missed it<br> somewhere off the coast of Virginia?<br> Right?<br> Hello?<br> Dirk.<br> I'll meet you at the boat.<br> No, I got the check.<br> Don't worry about it. I'm serious.<br> I know, I get it all the time.<br> Sit down, I'll get the check.<br> L'addition,<br> Ya-Sheikh.<br> My name is Dirk.<br> I'm looking for a boat.<br> And when would we be<br> seeing this boat?<br> About 140 years ago, in 1866.<br> Back when Labbezanga was<br> one of the greatest ports in Africa.<br> Do you know anything else?<br> We use events to find dates,<br> not dates to find events.<br> Well, there was a storm.<br> There was a great storm.<br> One that would have raised<br> the depths of the Niger<br> enough to allow the boat<br> to get here, yes.<br> It is written here.<br> Six days after the great storm,<br> a dark ship rode without sails<br> under the banner of a single star.<br> It was driven upriver,<br> never to return.<br> Bearing...<br> ...death.<br> It brought a sickness<br> from here up to Gao<br> and bore over 300 souls to heaven.<br> It was believed a damnation<br> from Allah.<br> A ghost ship.<br> A cursed ship.<br> What does that mean?<br> - What?<br> - That's Arabic, Al.<br> Yeah. Sounds poetic.<br> What's it mean?<br> "The ship of death."<br> Great. Should we call Sandecker?<br> - No.<br> - What ship? Whose death?<br> He'd just tell us to come home.<br> - Sounds reasonable.<br> - Yeah, then I'd get a case of tequila.<br> Boys, we are going upriver to Gao.<br> All right. Rudi, you gonna run<br> the sonar on the riverbed?<br> Come on, I was hoping to meet<br> a girl on the Australia trip.<br> No, African war zone. Ship of death.<br> Bye.<br> - Got a profile.<br> - Another truck bumper?<br> Bicycle? VCR?<br> Sixteen degrees, twenty-decimal-zero<br> minutes north, zero...<br> Wait, hold on. It's just<br> some interference with the buoy.<br> - Al.<br> - Yeah, I got it.<br> When did you check the calibration?<br> I had it out of the water<br> three hours ago.<br> All right.<br> - Anything, Al?<br> - Hey, guys.<br> Take a look at this.<br> It's red algae.<br> That doesn't make any sense,<br> this is fresh water.<br> - I'd better get a sample.<br> - Yep.<br> It's okay, they're just looking<br> for Tuareg fighters.<br> Very well, thank you.<br> For you.<br> Join me.<br> Thank you.<br> These belonged<br> to General Mayenne.<br> Then one of them actually killed<br> the Comte de Vezelay.<br> Isn't that fascinating?<br> Beads for the natives, Yves.<br> What do you want?<br> Well, you know the doctors<br> I was telling you about?<br> I am afraid they're<br> on their way to Mali.<br> I thought your man was going<br> to take care of them in Lagos.<br> - Well, we had a problem.<br> - And now the problem is mine.<br> And another thing, general,<br> if I may say,<br> I am slightly concerned<br> your measures of containment<br> are losing their effectiveness.<br> Why? Because five or six poor souls<br> escaped from Mali<br> - And died in their beds?<br> - The disease spreads quickly.<br> And luckily, it kills quickly too.<br> General, I think you should control<br> the movements of your population.<br> What's that?<br> Are you trying to tell me<br> how to run my country?<br> You take care<br> of your business, Yves.<br> I'll take care of mine.<br> Of course.<br> - Rocks?<br> - Nope.<br> - River? Radio?<br> - Nope.<br> - Radar?<br> - Rudi.<br> - You... That's not...<br> - It is.<br> - He can't even...<br> - Here we go again. I spy.<br> - All right, something I might get.<br> - I spy...<br> - I spy with my little eye...<br> - Guys.<br> - Company.<br> - This is the Malian Civil Authority.<br> - I got it.<br> - Prepare to be boarded.<br> You are trespassing<br> in Malian waters.<br> Shut off your engine<br> and throw out a rope.<br> Hi, this is Al Giordino speaking.<br> Al, Sandecker. I presume you're on<br> your way home with my boat?<br> - Everyone on deck, right now.<br> - It's for you.<br> - Al, what's going on?<br> - Where are the doctors?<br> Where are they? We are looking<br> for the doctors.<br> I have to put you on hold. I don't<br> believe this is a normal shakedown, Al.<br> If you do not shut off your engine,<br> you run the risk of being fired upon.<br> The doctors. We are looking<br> for the doctors. Where are they?<br> - Where is the woman?<br> - I'm sorry. I don't speak English.<br> You are speaking English now.<br> No, no. I only know how to say,<br> "I don't speak English," in English.<br> - Al.<br> - Hi. Hold on.<br> Stop! Stop the engines now<br> before we open fire.<br> Whoa, hat!<br> - Did you get my hat?<br> - Sorry, it's gone.<br> That's my favorite hat.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where's Dirk?<br> - I think he's...<br> Hold on.<br> Dirk! Dirk.<br> I'm gonna come in.<br> You jump on the front.<br> - You want me to jump?<br> - Get on the front of the boat. Got it?<br> - Really?<br> - What am I...?<br> - Al!<br> - What?<br> Here, flare gun.<br> - Signal for help?<br> - No, shoot them.<br> - Hey!<br> - Sorry.<br> Come a little closer, babe. Come.<br> Oh, yeah!<br> That is what I'm talking about.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - That was close.<br> - Al, pick up the phone,<br> - Yeah, it was.<br> - How about you?<br> - Pick up the phone,<br> - Glad I'm driving.<br> - Still there?<br> - I am too.<br> - What the hell is going on?<br> I shot a guy with a flare gun.<br> - A flare gun? What?<br> - Cool.<br> What did you... ? Did you say you<br> shot someone with a flare gun?<br> What did you... ? Did you say you<br> shot someone with a flare gun?<br> - What?<br> - Who?<br> Don't put the phone...<br> Rudi?<br> Who's shooting? Al, who's shooting?<br> Is someone shooting at you?<br> You'd better not hurt my boat,<br> Engine two is out.<br> Fourth and long, man.<br> What do you wanna do?<br> - I think we need to pull a Panama.<br> - A Panama. A Panama?!<br> - Panama?<br> - You think? Really?<br> - Yeah. Really.<br> - No Panama,<br> Somebody pick up... They're<br> ignoring me. They're ignoring...<br> Everybody's ignoring me.<br> Pick up the phone!<br> Take it. We're doing a Panama.<br> We're doing a Panama!<br> - What's a Panama?<br> - Navy thing.<br> - I didn't know you were in Panama.<br> - Weren't. We were in Nicaragua.<br> - Then why do you call it a Panama?<br> - We thought we were in Panama.<br> No Panama,<br> What are you looking for? Al!<br> Al. Al, I'm really confused.<br> How we doing, Al?<br> - Go help Dirk.<br> - What do I do with this?<br> Just go!<br> Down.<br> - Open the engine hatch.<br> - Okay.<br> Let's go, Al.<br> Got it.<br> Here, light this.<br> - Aren't these the admiral's?<br> - Just light it.<br> What the...?<br> Whenever you're ready, Al.<br> - Come on!<br> - What are we doing?<br> - I don't think you should be doing that.<br> - Okay. Drop it.<br> - We're good.<br> - Yeah?<br> - All right, hold on.<br> - Hold on.<br> Okay.<br> Al!<br> Hey, I need a life jacket.<br> Crap.<br> He did a Panama.<br> He did a Panama.<br> Cool.<br> - Is that how it worked the first time?<br> - Well...<br> ...it didn't really work<br> the first time.<br> - I lost my hat.<br> - Again?<br> Yeah.<br> Man, is Sandecker gonna be mad<br> when you tell him<br> you lost the satellite phone.<br> Not as mad as when Rudi tells him<br> it was attached to the boat.<br> - Wait. Why me?<br> - Because we're not going back.<br> - Right, Dirk?<br> - Nope. We're going to Asselar.<br> - No more Texas?<br> - Ironclad's on hold for a while, guys.<br> Those soldiers weren't after us.<br> They were after the doctors.<br> I got a feeling whatever bug<br> Eva's chasing, it must be a doozy.<br> - We gotta get there first.<br> - I'm going with you.<br> - Nope, you gotta tell Sandecker.<br> - Hold on. Hold on.<br> How am I gonna get across the border?<br> I never took survival training.<br> - Consider this your course.<br> - It's kind of pass-fail,<br> which I always thought was easier.<br> Look, Rudi. Lay up here till dark, then<br> make your move. The border's not far.<br> - Okay.<br> - All right.<br> Al, you remember<br> that time in Morocco?<br> Oh, yeah, when you made me ride<br> that damn camel<br> - That bit my ass.<br> - Yeah, that's the time.<br> Why?<br> God! What is the secret<br> to this thing?<br> Just wrap it around your nugget.<br> - What part? Here? This?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, how come yours stays on?<br> Maybe you got a small head.<br> I don't think so.<br> Somebody would've told me.<br> Thank you.<br> World Health Organization.<br> Hello?<br> Is anyone here?<br> Frank.<br> Look at this.<br> Anyone here?<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Oh, my God.<br> This well was filled in recently.<br> I think people here knew<br> the water was making them sick.<br> I still say we should<br> let Oumar go down.<br> Oumar, you wouldn't mind<br> going down that well, would you?<br> - No, it's okay. I'll go down.<br> - You see?<br> Frank, I'll be fine.<br> Yeah, there you go.<br> All right, you're looking good.<br> You're looking good.<br> - Give her a little more rope.<br> - Okay.<br> Be careful, please.<br> Just take your time.<br> Eva.<br> Eva, hold on.<br> Eva. Hold on. We've got you.<br> - You got it?<br> - It's okay.<br> - Bring her up.<br> - No, I'm fine.<br> Give me more rope.<br> Got it. I made it.<br> - Got water.<br> - All right, great.<br> Get what we need,<br> and let's get you out of there.<br> Hey, looks like we've got company.<br> Don't go anywhere.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Okay.<br> Hello there. I'm Dr. Hopper with<br> the World Health Organization.<br> - You have no authority to be here.<br> - What are you doing?<br> Eva, get those... Oh, my God!<br> - Frank!<br> - Charlie, please don't shoot me.<br> Charlie, don't...<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,<br> do you hear that?<br> - This is all of them?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> The UN knows that we're here. This is<br> a United Nations-sanctioned mission.<br> Where's your colleague?<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> I mean, the woman.<br> She didn't come. She's ill.<br> This pistol, it belonged<br> to General Sir Henry Watkins.<br> .455 caliber. Very rare.<br> Hard to find the rounds.<br> I have them made<br> by Holland & Holland of London.<br> Twenty-seven pounds each.<br> You should put the money<br> to better use.<br> Like containing this plague.<br> I will give you some advice.<br> Tell me where Dr. Rojas is.<br> She's not here.<br> Have it your own way.<br> Make it look like a horde of Tuareg<br> swine just came through here.<br> - And find the woman.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> She's here.<br> Somewhere.<br> You men, set up a perimeter.<br> I want you to search<br> the whole town.<br> - Hey, Salim, come over here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Open up a few rounds<br> just to be sure.<br> Hey.<br> Al, little help here.<br> Oh, man.<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa,<br> whoa, whoa, Eva.<br> Come on. You okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Come on.<br> We gotta go.<br> Wait. Wait!<br> Frank!<br> Frank!<br> We're done here.<br> We're in Tuareg country now.<br> We're gonna drive north about<br> three hours till we hit the flatlands.<br> From there it should be a relatively<br> easy drive to the Algerian border.<br> Sorry.<br> Eva.<br> Eva.<br> We'll get through, huh?<br> - This way.<br> - Please tell me what I am doing here.<br> Five men shot dead in cold blood.<br> What do you think about that?<br> Hardly my responsibility.<br> No, no, no, you sit, you sit.<br> You are a very brave man.<br> The only survivor.<br> Crawled all the way from Asselar<br> to bring me the news.<br> - How very commendable.<br> - Caught in a classic Tuareg ambush,<br> - Wouldn't you say?<br> - Possibly.<br> One problem.<br> There were no Tuareg.<br> Why didn't you tell me the doctors<br> had American military support?<br> - Because they didn't.<br> - The two unarmed men who did this...<br> ...they were not amateurs, Yves.<br> Nor were the ones on the boat.<br> - And they're the same men, I think.<br> - They're treasure hunters, general.<br> Marine salvage, they call themselves.<br> - Hardly your military elite.<br> - Don't underestimate them.<br> Watch out. And if you find them,<br> bring them to me.<br> What is it?<br> Get out of the Jeep.<br> Keep your hands up.<br> Move slowly.<br> What?<br> Three o'clock.<br> Tuaregs!<br> Hi. How are you?<br> Al, did you see that?<br> No, hang on a minute.<br> Who are you...<br> ...and why are you here?<br> We are enemies of Kazim.<br> You are American.<br> CIA?<br> No.<br> I'm a doctor from<br> the World Health Organization.<br> I'm investigating the source<br> of a disease.<br> Come with me.<br> This is the disease<br> you are looking for?<br> I believe it is.<br> All right. Ready to go, big D, big D.<br> It's not a plague.<br> - What?<br> - It's not a plague. It's a poison.<br> There are toxins in the water,<br> here and in Asselar.<br> - Toxins?<br> - Yes.<br> That's what's making<br> these people sick.<br> Can you treat it?<br> No.<br> - Admiral, what can I do for you?<br> - What do you hear from Mali?<br> - Beautiful country.<br> - Oh, kiss my ass.<br> I hear about a couple of<br> American boys and their fancy yacht<br> getting in some trouble on the Niger.<br> Does the agency have<br> a presence there?<br> No, it's strictly hands-off.<br> - Carl.<br> - What?<br> I gotta get my boys out.<br> They're private citizens.<br> Now, if they choose to go down there<br> and get themselves shot up<br> over some sunken treasure,<br> that is not a company problem.<br> - I'm not asking the company.<br> - Yeah.<br> You've got some nerve.<br> Come down here<br> compromising my cover,<br> and now you're gonna ask me to risk<br> my whole career over this nonsense?<br> Well, since you put it that way...<br> ...yes, I am.<br> - No, you're not,<br> because I'm not gonna do it.<br> I'm not gonna do it.<br> October 27th, 1982.<br> - Yeah, I knew you'd bring that up.<br> - And now I have.<br> - If I do this, we are even.<br> - The slate's clean.<br> - If I do this, we are even.<br> - The slate's clean.<br> I'll see what I can do.<br> Always a pleasure, my friend.<br> Benzine, heavy metals, nitrates,<br> Basically, the water's toxic.<br> I understand.<br> But Kazim's men followed your trail.<br> You must leave tomorrow<br> at first light.<br> Modibo.<br> Eva found the same poison<br> in the wells at Asselar.<br> - It's over 300 miles from here.<br> - Africa will find a place for us.<br> Modibo...<br> ...we have to find the source.<br> That is for you.<br> My duty is here with my people.<br> We leave in the morning.<br> I've heard that my car<br> pleases your eyes.<br> It's a 1936 Avions Voisin.<br> Six cylinders, sleeve-valve engine.<br> Do you know there was only<br> six of these ever made?<br> - How the hell did you get it?<br> - We borrowed it...<br> ...from Kazim.<br> Bye. Thank you.<br> Okay, ready? I'll do it. I'll do it.<br> Okay, here we go. Come on.<br> New Al record right here.<br> I got something you gotta see.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right, give me a minute.<br> - Come on!<br> That is your Texas we're looking at,<br> isn't it?<br> - Sure the hell looks like it.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Sitting in the middle of the desert.<br> - Yep.<br> Hey, I am not paying off the tequila<br> on a picture, okay?<br> Ship of the desert's a camel.<br> It's not an ironclad battleship.<br> I mean, there is no way that<br> that could get across the desert.<br> At one time, much of this desert<br> was lush, green farmland,<br> and there were rivers everywhere.<br> Now, the ironclad obviously<br> came up this river<br> and stopped at this structure,<br> which is a fort? A castle? I don't know.<br> So the climate changed.<br> So let's say the water level dropped,<br> and the boat became stranded.<br> Yeah, or sailed away.<br> Or the land dried up,<br> the soil turned to dust,<br> the sands blew in,<br> and the ship is still buried<br> to this day...<br> ...right here, next to the structure.<br> - Okay, great.<br> So all we have to do is wait<br> for the river to fill up again<br> and sail the Texas home.<br> - That's how it's spreading.<br> - What is?<br> The toxins.<br> What, in the dried-up,<br> nonexistent river?<br> No, no, no. The same river that was on<br> the surface 150 years ago still exists.<br> It's just beneath our feet now,<br> sunk in the sand,<br> running along the rock strata.<br> Now, the toxins are obviously leeching<br> from their source<br> into the underground river system.<br> - Spreading from well to well.<br> - Exactly.<br> So we find your Texas,<br> we find the underground river.<br> We find the river,<br> we find the source of the toxins.<br> - Admiral...<br> - Not now.<br> Rudi?<br> Admiral.<br> I have some bad news<br> about your boat.<br> According to the cave painting,<br> this is the place.<br> You know, Al, if we were here<br> we'd be swimming right now.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, you know how it is<br> when you see someone<br> that you haven't seen<br> since high school,<br> and they got some dead-end job,<br> and they're married to some woman<br> that hates them,<br> they got, like, three kids<br> that thinks he's a joke?<br> Wasn't there some point<br> where he stood back and said,<br> "Bob, don't take that job.<br> Bob, don't marry that harpy,"<br> you know?<br> Your point?<br> Well, we're in the middle of a desert,<br> Iooking for the source<br> of a river pollutant,<br> using as our map a cave drawing<br> of a Civil War gunship,<br> - Which is also in the desert.<br> - Right.<br> So I was just wondering<br> when we're gonna have to sit down<br> and reevaluate<br> our decision-making paradigm.<br> I don't know.<br> Working so far.<br> - Hey, Al.<br> - Yep?<br> - Let me see the scope.<br> - Sure.<br> - What do you see?<br> - I don't know.<br> It looks like a solar energy plant.<br> That's strange.<br> There's a collecting tower...<br> ...but no outgoing transmission lines.<br> "Massarde Enterprises."<br> Massarde? Yves Massarde?<br> Well, whoever it is,<br> they've got heavy security.<br> Let's check it out.<br> Come on! Come on! Come on!<br> Come on, come on!<br> Al!<br> Come on, Eva, kick him. Let's go!<br> One, two, three.<br> I got you.<br> - You okay?<br> - Yes.<br> - Nice job, doc.<br> - Thank you.<br> - How we doing, Al?<br> - Great.<br> Get in the hole.<br> - Admiral!<br> - Not now, Rudi. I don't have time.<br> Yes, sir, you do.<br> That... That's not possible.<br> Yellow Five, report to station three,<br> Loading procedure commencing,<br> Extraction protocol complete,<br> Please ensure all active materials<br> are securely stored,<br> Thank you for your cooperation,<br> - What the hell is this place?<br> - Good question.<br> These barrels here are probably full<br> of chemical waste.<br> They're going in that chamber...<br> ...they're coming out<br> the other side empty.<br> They're using the solar power<br> to superheat and vaporize the toxins.<br> That's smart. Looks clean too.<br> That's smart. Looks clean too.<br> What about those barrels?<br> Hi. How are you?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Well, I think we found your source.<br> Tuareg prisoners.<br> These must be the soldiers<br> captured from Modibo's village.<br> He thought they were dead.<br> This Massarde guy's really starting<br> to piss me off.<br> Well, it's time to call in the cavalry.<br> Let's go.<br> Well, Dr. Rojas, I do wish<br> you had stayed in Lagos.<br> So...<br> ... got your report,<br> Kind of dense, huh?<br> Okay, my understanding is...<br> ...there's a problem with the water.<br> Am I right?<br> Rudi?<br> The water in the Niger River<br> is being poisoned.<br> Right now, it's in Mali,<br> but it's headed toward us fast.<br> If we don't do something, within<br> one week it's gonna hit the Atlantic.<br> And when that interacts<br> with the salt water,<br> that growth rate is gonna explode.<br> The oxygen levels<br> in the affected waters<br> will decrease by 40 to 60 percent,<br> killing all plant and animal life.<br> If it gets to the ocean,<br> it's halfway to New York<br> within six months.<br> Then there's nothing we can do.<br> Is that all?<br> Do you have<br> any independent confirmation?<br> - Nope.<br> - Because intervening<br> in a sovereign country, granted I'm<br> only in the job a couple of months,<br> I'm pretty sure that's gonna<br> be tough to get an okay for.<br> - I need you to try.<br> - Oh, I'm gonna look into this. I am.<br> I'm gonna pass this on to the State<br> Department, get their take on this.<br> Okay, I think that's the best way<br> to proceed.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> Al.<br> Where the hell are we?<br> I don't know.<br> Where's Eva?<br> So the two Americans,<br> they're on their way, general.<br> The doctor? Well...<br> I'm afraid there has been<br> an incident, general.<br> An exchange of gunfire,<br> most unfortunate.<br> She... She's dead.<br> Yes, general. I'm sorry, I...<br> You know, Dr. Rojas,<br> you're lucky I'm such a gentleman.<br> Enabling program, phase two,<br> Please ensure all active materials...<br> Who else knows you're here?<br> This facility is a miracle<br> of modern science.<br> State-of-the-art technology.<br> Solar energy harnessed<br> to destroy the world's contaminants.<br> Not such a bad idea after all.<br> - It's a toxic-waste dump.<br> - It's not so simple.<br> You see, all new technology<br> has enemies.<br> Sandstorms, for example,<br> they chip away at the mirrors.<br> Productivity falls, and the waste<br> needs to be stored underground.<br> So we have developed new laminate<br> coating to protect the mirrors.<br> And with this new approach, our<br> problems should now be in the past.<br> You're poisoning<br> a river system underground.<br> It's spreading across Western Africa.<br> You're wrong. That's impossible.<br> Securing burn chamber,<br> Who else knows you're here?<br> The Nigerian government.<br> The WHO.<br> No one else knows you're here,<br> do they?<br> Initiate system safety check,<br> What are you doing?<br> I got it.<br> Die.<br> Live.<br> You got it?<br> Clear?<br> Got it.<br> Ready? One, two, three.<br> One, two, three.<br> Wait. Not good. Not good. New plan!<br> - I like it.<br> - No!<br> Well...<br> ...that's a new one.<br> - Yeah.<br> We're home free now.<br> Sweet, sweet, sweet<br> Run fast, she don't<br> But she swims real well<br> Racing through the water<br> With a swish of her tail<br> She's my little mermaid<br> Massarde, your packages<br> have not arrived,<br> Apparently they were lost<br> in the desert,<br> - Yes, I heard.<br> - Tell me, Yves, the doctor?<br> - Promise me she's dead.<br> - Oh, yes, yes.<br> Be a shame to fall out<br> over a woman, no?<br> General, I've come here to tell you<br> that I think we should suspend<br> waste shipments to the plant<br> - For the time being.<br> - Nonsense.<br> The borders are all closed. The sick<br> are either quarantined or dead.<br> I did not expend all these resources<br> only to see my profits shrink.<br> Yes, but I have good reasons<br> to believe<br> the toxins are in the Niger River.<br> Then the problem is no longer ours,<br> but our neighbors' downstream.<br> They will soon find out.<br> The Americans did.<br> Okay, Yves, as you please.<br> Close the plant.<br> But your payments to me<br> will continue.<br> Okay?<br> Don't worry. It's Africa.<br> Nobody cares about Africa.<br> This photo was taken 24 hours ago.<br> Normally, Kazim likes to keep his tanks<br> where he can see them,<br> in case the people get frisky.<br> This one, taken four hours ago,<br> shows the tanks mobilizing north<br> to the desert.<br> And my guess,<br> and intelligence supports this,<br> - They're looking for your boys.<br> - Well, we'll have to find them first.<br> We already did.<br> Yesterday they showed up<br> in a Tuareg village<br> - About 200 miles northwest of Gao.<br> - That's within range.<br> You could get choppers in there<br> if you flew at night.<br> - But your boys already left.<br> - Left? Where? Going where?<br> Well, based on their behavior<br> so far...<br> ...I have no idea.<br> - Dirk.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see it.<br> Well, you don't see that every day.<br> I bet you 100<br> there's a toolkit in there.<br> I don't wanna rain on<br> your crazy parade, buddy,<br> but I don't think we can fix this thing.<br> - A little more to the left, Al.<br> - Left.<br> Yeah, that's it, right there. Right there.<br> We're dialed in, baby.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hey, admiral.<br> - Dirk?<br> - How you doing?<br> Oh, Dirk, thank God,<br> Where the hell are you?<br> Well, that's a damn good question.<br> Listen, I've got some bad news.<br> Your buddy, Yves Massarde,<br> he's got an industrial factory<br> that's dumping deadly toxins<br> into the Niger.<br> - Massarde? Oh, Christ.<br> - I think he's got Eva at his plant.<br> Which hopefully is gonna be<br> our next stop.<br> Well, I've got something for you.<br> Rudi's got chemistry here<br> that says if that leak's not shut down<br> ASAP, it's gonna reach the ocean,<br> When it does, that'll be ground zero<br> for the Atlantic's version of Chernobyl.<br> - I get it.<br> - I've got something more,<br> I've got word that Kazim<br> has mobilized his troops<br> and is heading across the desert.<br> We could use some serious muscle<br> here, admiral.<br> Well, you're not gonna get it.<br> Not fast enough.<br> I'm getting the D.C. two-step bigtime.<br> - And this has to be done...<br> - Yesterday. I got it.<br> Hey!<br> - Dirk?<br> - Yeah?<br> I can't ask you boys to go this alone.<br> Well, that's the great part, sir.<br> You know you never have to.<br> There is no more time, Modibo.<br> Now is your chance to hit Kazim<br> where it really hurts.<br> We only have small arms.<br> They are no use against concrete<br> and heavy machine guns.<br> But you have power in numbers.<br> We attack when he does not<br> expect it. We have to try.<br> Do you know what Kazim's war<br> with us has cost my people in lives?<br> - In the poverty and disease it causes?<br> - Then come with us.<br> And let's finish it.<br> I cannot afford to have my men<br> slaughtered in a full-frontal attack.<br> We cannot go with you.<br> I understand.<br> All right, we got another idea.<br> Can I borrow your car?<br> Kazim. Kazim!<br> Had you going there, didn't we?<br> You?<br> Hi. How are you?<br> Zakara, go get the doctor.<br> Move on ahead. Let's go.<br> - Where is everybody?<br> - I don't know, corporate retreat?<br> Go.<br> Something's wrong here, Al.<br> This place is completely deserted.<br> Modibo.<br> Nobody home.<br> - Hey, Al?<br> - Yeah.<br> What would you do if you were about<br> to be exposed as the worst polluter<br> of modern times?<br> I don't know. Run for president?<br> - You'd hide the evidence, right?<br> - Yeah, right.<br> How?<br> How do you hide 50 tons<br> of industrial waste<br> without anybody noticing it?<br> You don't.<br> - He's gonna blow the place, Al.<br> - That's not exactly subtle.<br> That's what he's gonna do.<br> That's why it's abandoned.<br> Make it look like an industrial accident,<br> - And he walks.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> - No, not really.<br> - Why?<br> The toxins<br> would be sealed underground,<br> and there would be no way<br> to contain them, Al.<br> Look, to bring this place down, he'd<br> need 20 or 30 military-grade devices,<br> all wired for simultaneous detonation.<br> It would never look like an accident.<br> Unless one centrally placed device<br> diverted all the plant's stored energy<br> into one massive explosion.<br> - Which would look like an accident.<br> - Yes.<br> Well, we gotta get that bomb, Al.<br> No, I'll find the bomb,<br> you get the girl.<br> Deal.<br> That's it.<br> Got it. Bomb in a barrel.<br> Come on.<br> Get in. Get us out of here. Now!<br> Come on, let's go!<br> - Eva. Out, out, out!<br> - Don't shoot!<br> - Back off. Back off! Move!<br> - Easy.<br> I apologize, Mr. Pitt.<br> - This is not what it appears.<br> - Did I miss something?<br> I've seen your toxic dump.<br> I've seen the sick Tuareg women<br> and kids, and I saw the dead in Asselar.<br> - I leave something out?<br> - Dirk!<br> Get this thing out of here, quick!<br> Stay here and don't move!<br> Stop!<br> Eva!<br> Take us up 1,000 meters<br> and circle the plant.<br> Remote system activated,<br> All personnel, please move<br> to designated safety areas,<br> Initiate mirror positioning,<br> Temperature threshold, 10 percent,<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Commence incineration burn,<br> In five, four, three,<br> two, one,<br> Warning: Malfunction detected,<br> Initiate emergency shutdown,<br> Thank you, and have a nice da...<br> Get us out of here, quick.<br> Eva.<br> How many times<br> am I gonna have to save your ass?<br> Well, in case you didn't notice,<br> I actually saved yours.<br> I wasn't in any danger.<br> - Oh, no?<br> - No, I'd have thought of something.<br> Come here.<br> We gotta go.<br> Hey, what's with the costumes?<br> Uniforms? It's his idea.<br> Hey, by the way, with this plan<br> of yours, do we have enough gas?<br> Oh, stop being so negative, Al.<br> - It's coming around on our 6.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's Kazim.<br> Hey, maybe he wants his car back.<br> Al, did you bring any of the explosives<br> from Massarde's?<br> - Couldn't find them.<br> - Al.<br> - I didn't have time.<br> - Al!<br> Of course I brought the explosives!<br> Eva, I hope you don't throw like a girl.<br> He's coming around.<br> Al, I need a door right now!<br> Oh, my hat!<br> Damn it!<br> Okay, here's the plan.<br> Eva, get in the back seat<br> behind me. Go!<br> - Al?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Give her that bag of explosives.<br> - Gotcha!<br> All right, hold on!<br> Yeah.<br> Eva, I need you to throw a bundle<br> of the dynamite into that hillside<br> every time I say. Comprende?<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right.<br> I'm good!<br> Now!<br> Get us out. Move. Move!<br> - Dirk, we need cover!<br> - I'm working on it!<br> Oh, my God.<br> Come on, Eva. Let's go, let's go.<br> Come on!<br> Move, move!<br> Eva, help me dig.<br> Come on, let's go, let's go!<br> - How we looking, Al?<br> - Great.<br> Dig faster!<br> Need a little help, Al.<br> Go.<br> - Al?<br> - Yeah.<br> You didn't see any extra fuel tanks<br> on that bird, did you?<br> - No, I didn't see any.<br> - That means he only has<br> of flight time.<br> These walls are about 2 feet thick<br> with a double-steel coating,<br> so there's no way his bullets can get<br> to us. We just sit tight, wait him out.<br> Eva, down!<br> - Say, Dirk?<br> - Yeah.<br> You wanna talk me<br> through that again?<br> - Armor-piercing rounds.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm fine.<br> Hey, Al.<br> - No, Dirk.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> No, it'll never work.<br> - Why not?<br> - It's 150 years old.<br> But, Al, it's hardly ever been used.<br> - It'll probably blow us to bits!<br> - Well, then at least we'll die fighting.<br> - Yeah, that's comforting.<br> - We need to open that gun port.<br> What the hell are we doing, guys?<br> - I've gotta go outside.<br> - All right, go.<br> Civil War piece of...<br> That's it, Al.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Next time, you go.<br> - What the hell took you so long?<br> - What?<br> - Hey, guys.<br> - I stopped for coffee.<br> - Get a receipt?<br> - Yeah, I got a receipt.<br> - I got you one too.<br> - You're the best, Al.<br> You know what? I'll even get you<br> the money from Sandecker.<br> - Guys!<br> - What?<br> Oh, great.<br> Now we're really in trouble.<br> - Incoming!<br> - Down!<br> Okay.<br> If we bring down Kazim,<br> the army will surrender.<br> - Cut the head off the snake...<br> - Body dies.<br> Exactly. We're gonna need<br> cannonball, powder and fuses.<br> - I'll get the cannonball.<br> - Eva, I need you to find the fuses.<br> They're gonna be in a box this size.<br> They look something<br> like carrot sticks. Go.<br> - 150 yards!<br> - How you feeling, Al?<br> - I got them!<br> - Good, good, good.<br> Incoming!<br> Jefferson Davis had how<br> many samples made?<br> - Let's get that cannon out the porthole.<br> - Yeah.<br> On the count of three,<br> we're gonna pull. Ready, Al?<br> - Ready.<br> - One, two, three.<br> - Yeah!<br> - That's it!<br> - Bring me up 30 degrees, Al.<br> - Yeah.<br> Got it.<br> I'm so tired of being shot at!<br> Hold your positions.<br> Secure the area. I will finish this.<br> Go! Go!<br> No! Get it now!<br> Get it out!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> Look, look, look, look, look.<br> Looks like you killed the snake.<br> There's no way that<br> - That should've worked, right?<br> - That should've worked.<br> - Yeah!<br> - Yeah!<br> Yeah!<br> You know, from our point of view,<br> the great thing is, we capped the plant.<br> The river's safe.<br> And I also understand<br> the WHO is administering<br> an antitoxin in the villages<br> formulated from Dr. Rojas' samples.<br> - Better late than never.<br> - Absolutely.<br> So I trust your work on<br> the Texas is going well?<br> Giordino's on the job,<br> making sure everything<br> gets where it's supposed to go,<br> - All right!<br> - Say, probably not true,<br> but did I hear a rumor there's some<br> American gold onboard, on the Texas?<br> Really? Be nice if it were true.<br> No. I can assure you, there's no gold<br> there belonging to the U.S.<br> Admiral, the administration<br> was highly impressed<br> with the way you expedited<br> all the red tape down here.<br> - They'd like to fold NUMA into...<br> - No, thanks.<br> I'll never work in government again.<br> Which is exactly what<br> they said you'd say.<br> Look, they're offering full funding<br> in exchange for<br> the occasional side job<br> for the good guys.<br> - Who decides who the good guys are?<br> - You only do the jobs you want.<br> - I need a new yacht.<br> - You got it.<br> - And Rudi needs new computers.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Done.<br> There's one more thing.<br> Negligence is a gray area<br> of the law, Yves.<br> If the right people are approached<br> and handled in the right manner,<br> I think we avoid<br> prosecution completely.<br> Not bad, eh? You, me,<br> the bay of Monterey.<br> You know, I was thinking.<br> Remember that day in the desert?<br> With the car, dynamite,<br> Kazim's chasing us in the helicopter?<br> Yeah?<br> There's something I wanted to say<br> to you that I never got a chance to.<br> What's that?<br> You do throw like a girl.<br> Hey! You do!<br>
