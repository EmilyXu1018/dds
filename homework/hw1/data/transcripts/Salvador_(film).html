But a lot of people were.<br> lf these guys in the hills took power, the<br> Pol Pot incident would look like a picnic.<br> Are they as bad as Major Max<br> and the Mano Blanca?<br> l don't know. We got<br> a pathological killer on the Right,...<br> ..God knows what on the Left,<br> and a gutless middle.<br> Anyway, Boyle, about your problem here.<br> Carol checked with the National Guard,<br> the police, the regular army.<br> Nobody seems to know<br> anything about this boy. We think...<br> With respect, Ambassador, they're lying.<br> He didn't just disappear. Nobody just<br> disappears in El Salvador. They got him.<br> - Have you checked with Human Rights?<br> - The Human Rights Office?!<br> They rearranged this kid's molecules<br> and they took their time!<br> He is dying out there while<br> we're talking. He's just a kid!<br> - He's just a kid!<br> - Richard...<br> - Richard, please calm down.<br> - l'm sorry.<br> Ambassador, look. His sister is<br> my girlfriend. She's on the shit list.<br> l gotta get a ceduIa for her. They could<br> come tonight, take her away and kill her!<br> Richard, Richard!<br> That doesn't have anything to do with us.<br> You know the laws of this country. She's<br> gonna have to go back to her home town.<br> - Where's she from?<br> - Morazan. She can't get near there.<br> lf she does, the guards'll kill her<br> as a suspected G. Fuck!<br> All right. l'll do the best<br> l can, but it's very tough.<br> There are thousands of people in this<br> predicament. Everybody wants a ceduIa.<br> Let me ask you this.<br> - What if l married her?<br> - Richard, you're already married.<br> Sir, l know you're very busy.<br> Thank you very much.<br> But that's in the States.<br> Suppose l just married her?<br> - l'll do whatever l can.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Maybe you could talk to lmmigration?<br> - Just let me see what l can do.<br> We want to see you<br> at the Christmas party.<br> Maybe l could keep in touch with you<br> and we could talk over some ideas?<br> - l give up on you.<br> - What do you mean, you give up?<br> - Every time l get...<br> - He liked me, this guy.<br> - What's goin' on?<br> - l gotta get a ceduIa for Maria.<br> Maria.<br> Maria, they can't find Carlos yet,<br> but the American ambassador is involved.<br> The thing is, though,<br> you are in great danger.<br> Without a ceduIa, they can grab<br> you at any time, comprende?<br> So l've been thinking about something,<br> and what l think we should do...<br> - Marry me.<br> - What?<br> We could have a family together.<br> Duglas, Reina, you and me...<br> - And Carlos, what about him?<br> - And Carlos too, when we find him. ? Si?<br> - You already have a wife.<br> - No, no. That's been over for six months.<br> l got a divorce. l never told you.<br> - (man) Hi, Boyle!<br> - Just a second.<br> - Hey, Peter.<br> - Atlanta's gonna give you a shot!<br> - No!<br> - lf you fuck up this time...<br> Not a chance. That's great, Peter. Thanks.<br> Right. Well, l want<br> some real stuff on the Gs.<br> - Sure you're set with Alvarez?<br> - We're like this.<br> OK. You got a camera, the crew and<br> the Arena press conference tomorrow.<br> - Right. Major Max.<br> - He's gonna declare for president.<br> l'm going to Venezuela,<br> so you'll have to cover for me.<br> That's great! Listen, could you<br> lend me 50 bucks, man? l'm a little low.<br> You don't change, do you, Boyle?<br> Let's see what we've got here...<br> Get out of it!<br> - 200 of them. You owe me.<br> - 200 coIones.<br> - Out of my own pocket...<br> - Right.<br> - ..so no whores.<br> - OK.<br> - Do a good job, Boyle. See ya.<br> - You're a mensch. You're great.<br> - Entonces, ? si o no?<br> - No.<br> ? Por que no, mi amor?<br> - Soy una mujer catoIica.<br> - So what?<br> - l can't marry a divorced man.<br> - Oh, God!<br> And you, Richard,<br> are a bad Catholic in all ways.<br> How am l a bad Catholic?<br> - You're living in sin.<br> - No, no, no, l'm not.<br> - You drink.<br> - OK, once in a while l drink.<br> You sleep with many women.<br> - You smoke marijuana.<br> - That was Rock's.<br> And you lie. You scheme and scam.<br> What is good or decent about you?<br> What redemption can you expect?<br> Well, none, l guess, but look...<br> OK, you got a point.<br> l am a fuckin' weasel, there's no doubt.<br> But think about this.<br> lf l went to church - l haven't been in 30<br> years - but if l went and took confession...<br> lf we took Communion together...<br> redemption. That would be great.<br> We could go to Archbishop Romero.<br> He likes me very much.<br> l could become a lay Catholic worker.<br> lt'd be wonderful. l could get a basket...<br> l feel good about this. This redemption<br> thing is good. l feel cleansed already.<br> - You want some of this?<br> - No. No more marijuana.<br> l'm gonna talk to Archbishop Romero.<br> Maybe he could annul<br> my marriage to Claudia.<br> She was a Commie atheist anyway.<br> l'm gonna talk to him about this seriously.<br> Very good man. He's a man of the people.<br> He's a man of God.<br> They say he's gonna win<br> the Nobel peace prize.<br> Hey, what's this?<br> Another demonstration, Boyle?<br> Calm down. Take it easy.<br> Stop! Stop, please!<br> l have orders to evacuate the plaza<br> in five minutes. Do you understand me?<br> l have permission.<br> - Why don't you stop the repression?<br> - No matter. Five minutes or violence.<br> Why don't you do something<br> about the Disappeared?<br> Violence.
