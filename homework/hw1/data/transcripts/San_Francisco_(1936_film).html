Bravo.<br> - Brava. Brava.<br> - How long has that girl been down here?<br> - Just started.<br> - What's her name?<br> - Mary Blake.<br> What did I tell you, Maestro?<br> Was I wrong?<br> - Or was I...<br> - Will you get back to that piano?<br> Yes. I'm going.<br> And I don't care if you fire me.<br> At least I've had the opportunity<br> to help a great...<br> Well, who said I was firing you?<br> - Now, come on. Get going.<br> - Yes. Thank you, Mr. Norton. Thank you.<br> I'd like to meet that girl.<br> - Waiter.<br> - Yes, Mr. Burley?<br> See if Miss Blake will meet<br> a respectful admirer.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I haven't had her<br> working the boxes yet, Burley.<br> I'm glad of that.<br> One never knows<br> where one's going to find talent.<br> No. No, one never does, does one?<br> Yes, and I quote from Plautus.<br> Yeah. You took the words<br> right out of my mouth.<br> Mr. Burley?<br> It's very gracious of you<br> to allow us this privilege, Miss Blake.<br> - Thank you.<br> - May I present Signor Baldini?<br> - How do you do, signor?<br> - Good evening, my dear.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> Waiter, a bottle of Cordon Rouge '94.<br> You bet, sir. And the usual for you?<br> Yes. A little water.<br> Hearing a voice like yours<br> in the variety theater...<br> has been for me a great experience.<br> Thank you, signor.<br> But you might have heard me<br> under more favorable circumstances.<br> I sat in the outer office of the Tivoli<br> for six days once.<br> Really?<br> - So you want to sing in opera?<br> - That's why I came to San Francisco.<br> - You have the training, too, huh?<br> - Yes, with the best teacher in Denver.<br> I led the Bach Choral Society,<br> I won first prize at the Schubert Festival...<br> and I've done, Violetta, Marguerite...<br> Puccini's Mimi, and Tosca. I love Puccini.<br> Did you ever hear of Puccini, Norton?<br> Yeah. Didn't he run a joint<br> down on Dupont Street?<br> There's no law against an opera singer<br> being slender and young and beautiful.<br> What do you think<br> about giving Miss Blake an audition?<br> Yes, by all means.<br> Say, that's darn sweet of you, Burley...<br> to take an interest in the little lady,<br> and you, too, signor...<br> but, unfortunately,<br> she's under a two-year contract.<br> - To whom?<br> - To me.<br> - Two years?<br> - Yes.<br> But I'll have her notify you<br> the minute it runs out.<br> But surely you wouldn't let that<br> stand in her way to sing in the Tivoli.<br> Why? She's doing all right here.<br> - I'm sorry, Miss Blake.<br> - Mr. Norton's quite right.<br> After all, Paradise is just as important<br> to him...<br> as the Tivoli is to you.<br> What would happen to the Tivoli...<br> if its artists were allowed to walk out<br> anytime they pleased?<br> You are a very loyal girl, Miss Blake.<br> No, I'm very grateful to Mr. Norton.<br> Well, I'll be going.<br> We don't have much time<br> between numbers.<br> Thank you, signor.<br> This has been the happiest night<br> of my life.<br> Goodnight. Thank you.<br> - Bye.<br> - I haven't given up yet about the Tivoli.<br> - You don't know Mr. Norton.<br> - You don't know me.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Just a minute. I want to see you.<br> Who told you to sing<br> that highbrow number?<br> No one.<br> Well, now that you've made<br> your impression, don't do it again.<br> Blackie doesn't like it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Friend of mine runs a joint<br> around on Kearney Street.<br> I want you to hurry around there,<br> tear off a little number for him.<br> All right. Where is it?<br> St. Anne's Mission, just around the corner.<br> - St. Anne's?<br> - Yes. Ask for Father Mullin.<br> I guess you'd know all the hokey-pokey<br> they sing in those traps.<br> Well, come on, get going. You've got<br> a number to do back here at 10:30.<br> - We won't need that now.<br> - Thank you.<br> Burley, you don't want me<br> to run for supervisor, eh?<br> You know as well as I<br> it's not practical to rebuild the Coast.<br> No? Why not?<br> The Coast is picturesque.<br> People come down here slumming.<br> They don't want to feel<br> like they're in a spotless town.<br> - Yes, but that isn't your real reason.<br> - That's one of them.<br> But the main one is<br> you don't want to spend your dough...<br> to make your property down here safe.<br> If I did what you wanted me to,<br> to my property...<br> it would be a calamity for the Coast.<br> - How do you figure that?<br> - In the first place...<br> the Burley Estate has got to make<br> certain interest on its investment.<br> I'd have to raise rents.<br> Why, you boys couldn't live.<br> You'd have to charge 10 cents<br> for a glass of beer.<br> You know, I don't get him, Mr. Baldini.<br> He tosses a fortune every year<br> into the Tivoli Opera House.<br> But that's not business.<br> That's for San Francisco.<br> - Yeah, the Coast is San Francisco, too.<br> - That's why I wouldn't change it.<br> Well, Burley, these little mugs down here<br> are my people.<br> And I'm gonna see<br> that they get a square deal.<br> So I'm not pulling out of this fight.<br> I don't want to fight you, Norton,<br> but you're asking for it.<br> I'm not ducking anything.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> - You're wanted on the phone, boss.<br> - Okay.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, hello, Tim.<br> I've finished the service,<br> so why don't you come on over?<br> What for?<br> For the organ recital<br> and to hear the young lady sing.<br> She'll be coming back here<br> to sing the things I like.<br> All right, have it your own way.<br> I was just sort of hoping<br> you'd make my evening complete.<br> If I had you here now, I'd hug you<br> and then I'd knock your block off.<br> I guess I don't have to tell you again<br> how I feel about the organ.<br> - Forget it.<br> - All right, Blackie. Goodbye.<br> - Oh, Father, that was simply marvelous.<br> - And that little boy, wasn't he sweet?<br> It's pretty late now.<br> Can you get home all right?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Hey, Mike.<br> - Yes, Father?<br> - Got any money?<br> - Sure, Father. Me wife's got a job.<br> - Good night, Father.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Father.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Father Mullin.<br> - It was very nice of you...<br> to leave your work<br> and come to our rescue.<br> It made me feel good being here.<br> You're not the girl<br> whose father was a preacher, are you?<br> Well, yes. How do you know?<br> Blackie told me.<br> Come in here, won't you?<br> I'd like to talk to you.<br> - Oh, but I'm afraid I'll be late.<br> - That's all right. I'll fix it with Blackie.<br> - Will you join me in a cup of coffee?<br> - Yes. I'd like to. Thank you.<br> I make good coffee.<br> How are you making out at The Paradise?<br> - Well, I've only just started.<br> - I see. Sit down there, won't you?<br> - Thank you.<br> - How do you like Blackie?<br> I'm afraid of him.<br> And he's someone to be afraid of.<br> He's as unscrupulous with women<br> as he is ruthless with men.<br> But why did he send me down here?<br> I don't understand him.<br> - You don't, huh?<br> - No.<br> What's the matter?<br> You probably understand Blackie...<br> a whole lot better<br> than he understands you.<br> You see, I don't think Blackie ever knew<br> your type of woman before.<br> But there's nothing to be afraid of,<br> unless you're afraid of yourself.<br> Are you?<br> No.<br> No, I guess I'm a little dazed.<br> You see, I've been in San Francisco<br> for over six weeks...<br> and nothing ever happened.<br> And then, within the last 24 hours,<br> the whole world's gone topsy-turvy.<br> Makes me feel like running home.<br> Well, if you are afraid,<br> you'd better run home.<br> How about it?<br> - I'm going to stay.<br> - That's right.<br> You're in probably the wickedest,<br> most corrupt...<br> most godless city in America.<br> Sometimes it frightens me.<br> I wonder what the end is going to be.<br> But nothing can harm you<br> if you don't allow it to...<br> because nothing in the world,<br> no one in the world, is all bad.<br> Do you know who gave the chapel<br> that organ we've been dedicating tonight?<br> The most godless, scoffing<br> and unbelieving soul in all San Francisco.<br> Blackie Norton.<br> Yes, Blackie heard one night<br> that I was saving for an organ.<br> The very next morning men arrived<br> to plan the installation.<br> Cost him $4,000.<br> You know, if that monkey would save<br> his money for a couple weeks...<br> he'd be a rich man.<br> He's a tremendous force, Blackie is.<br> If he were only a force for good<br> instead of evil.<br> I've tried to do something with him<br> for years...<br> but I haven't had any luck.<br> Maybe I'm not the right one.<br> You've known each other a long time,<br> haven't you?<br> Oh, sure, sure.<br> Blackie and I were kids together.<br> Born and brought up on the Coast.<br> We used to sell newspapers<br> in the joints along Pacific Street.<br> Blackie was the leader<br> of all the kids in the neighborhood...<br> and I was his pal.<br> Our families used to try to get us<br> to go to mass on Sunday...<br> but we generally ducked.<br> That reminds me,<br> that Rooney kid ducked mass.<br> And then I got so I wanted to go.<br> Blackie thought I was crazy.<br> And when I made up my mind<br> I was going to study for the priesthood...<br> I wanted to talk to Blackie.<br> I wanted to see<br> if I couldn't get him to understand...<br> to feel a little bit as I felt...<br> but he just said, "Well, good luck, sucker,"<br> and that was all.<br> We never were able to have that talk.<br> I came back from college...<br> and found Blackie deeper than ever<br> in the life of the Coast. He's gone right on.<br> But he has a code. He's always had,<br> ever since he's been a kid.<br> He never lied, he never cheated...<br> and I'm sure he never took<br> an underhanded advantage of anyone.<br> There's a picture of us together<br> when we were kids.<br> Don't let him know<br> I told you about the organ.<br> - Boy, he'd never forgive me.<br> - Oh, no. Oh, no, I won't.<br> He's that way, Blackie is.<br> Ashamed of his good deeds<br> as other people are ashamed of their sins.<br> But nobody in the world<br> will ever make me believe...<br> there isn't a whole lot more good<br> than there is bad in Blackie Norton.<br> Holy smoke! The coffee.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> introducing the President...<br> of the Ladies' Blackie Norton Club...<br> Miss Della Bailey!<br> Girls and boys, I just want to tell you<br> that the ladies of the Coast...<br> wish to go on record<br> as endorsing Blackie Norton...<br> right up to the limit!<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> I will now introduce that great guy...<br> our candidate.<br> Born on the Coast, raised on the Coast...<br> lives on the Coast, a-vying for the Coast...<br> our champion, Blackie Norton!<br> Thanks. Thanks.<br> I'm no politician.<br> I didn't ask for this,<br> but now that I'm in it...<br> I won't stop<br> until I get some decent fire laws...<br> for our people down on the Coast.<br> Wait a minute, Norton.<br> What I want to know is,<br> what construction company...<br> is paying you<br> for trying to rebuild the Coast?<br> Yeah. That's right. How about it, Blackie?<br> Why are you going into politics?<br> Go on, Norton, tell us.<br> Here's the answer<br> you can take to your boss, Jack Burley.<br> We've tried long enough<br> to get a square deal...<br> from those potbellied landowners<br> up on Nob Hill.<br> Now we're going to go after it on our own!<br> Wait a minute. Tommy, come here.<br> This is Jim Sullivan's kid.<br> Last New Year's Eve...<br> he and his sister had to jump three floors<br> out of a burning building.<br> Are we going to go on<br> letting these Nob Hill stiffs...<br> make fire dancers<br> out of our women and kids?<br> Not if I can help it!<br> And now, free beer on me!<br> Kiddo, you were swell.<br> I'm so proud of you, I...<br> Yeah, yeah, now thanks.<br> You run along and get yourself some beer.<br> But, Blackie,<br> aren't we going to be together?<br> Well, I told you I'd be busy<br> when I brought you out here.<br> - I'll wait for you.<br> - Over there by that first beer truck.<br> You get yourself a drink. That's a girl.<br> Professor, will you do a favor for me?<br> Sure. What is it?<br> Go over there and get Trixie<br> and take her back to town.<br> - To town?<br> - Yeah.<br> She's hanging around those beer trucks<br> getting stiff.<br> Then what about Miss Blake?<br> - Oh, how do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> You know, I brought Miss Blake out here.<br> That's all right.<br> I'll see that she gets home all right.<br> That's awful pretty. Know the name of it?<br> Would You?<br> Would I what?<br> - Glad you came?<br> - Yes.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> Do you mind going a little faster, please?<br> I promised Father Mullin I'd stop by<br> if I had time.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Go on. Giddap, Dan.<br> You and Tim seem to be hitting it off<br> pretty well.<br> Oh, yes.<br> - What do you talk about?<br> - Lots of things. His work, mostly.<br> Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.<br> You believe in that hocus-pocus,<br> don't you?<br> Yes.<br> Even if I hadn't believed, the faith of a man<br> like Father Mullin would make me.<br> Yeah, that's the trouble.<br> It gets hold of people that are all right<br> and makes monkeys out of them.<br> It lost me Tim Mullin.<br> Why, he'd have made the greatest gambler<br> the Coast has ever had.<br> The only mug I ever wanted to hang on to.<br> He loves you more than anyone else<br> in the world.<br> Yeah? Well, he blew me<br> for a lot of plaster saints.<br> You know, I don't go<br> for that sucker competition, Mary.<br> Blackie's got to be number one boy.<br> But it isn't competition.<br> I think people who believe in something<br> can love each other more.<br> Yeah. Honey, if that's what you believe,<br> it's all right with me.<br> I don't hold it against you.<br> - Say, who's that mug you're stuck on?<br> - No one.<br> - Well, didn't there used to be?<br> - No.<br> - Never?<br> - Never, no.<br> Whoa.<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - No.<br> Well, I'm a sucker<br> if I ever knew a girl like you before.<br> Come on. Get along there, Dan.<br> You must have had to do<br> some fast footwork...<br> to side-step those dudes<br> out there in Benson, Colorado, huh?<br> It wasn't so difficult, Mr. Norton.<br> Blackie.<br> Blackie.<br> That's better.<br> He holds her in his arms<br> Would you? Would you?<br> He tells her of her charms<br> Would you? Would you?<br> They met as you and I<br> And they were only friends<br> But before the story ends<br> He'll kiss her with a sigh<br> Would you? Would you?<br> If the girl were I<br> Would you? Would you?<br> And would you dare to say<br> Let's do the same as they<br> I would<br> Would you?<br> Well, that lets me out.<br> - That all your dough you got left?<br> - Every dime.<br> Here's $100, Edgar.<br> Go get yourself a cup of coffee.<br> Gee, thanks, Blackie.<br> I guess I'm gonna get some sleep.<br> - Hey, Chick. Put this stuff away, will you?<br> - Okay.<br> - Hello, Mr. Burley.<br> - Good morning.<br> Well, good morning, Burley.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> Yes, I want to buy that contract<br> that you have with Miss Blake.<br> What makes you think it's for sale?<br> I don't see why you're so stubborn<br> about it, Norton.<br> - You might be needing money.<br> - I'm doing all right.<br> You may be in for a few difficulties<br> down here.<br> What do you mean difficulties?<br> Did you ever hear<br> of the Johnson-Addi gambling ordinance?<br> Yep.<br> You know<br> you're operating against the law.<br> Well, so's every other joint<br> in San Francisco.<br> Well, I'm just telling you, that's all.<br> You've taken quite an interest<br> in the little lady, haven't you?<br> I'm only interested in making her<br> a useful member...<br> of the Tivoli opera company.<br> Yeah. Now isn't that sweet of you?<br> I'll tell you what I'll do, Burley.<br> If the little lady wants to leave me,<br> you can have her contract for nothing.<br> - Mary.<br> - Yes?<br> Come here a minute, will you?<br> You're taking a long chance, Blackie.<br> Yeah. Maybe I got an ace or two<br> in the hole, too.<br> - Oh, Mr. Burley.<br> - Good morning, Miss Blake.<br> - I'd like to thank you for the lovely roses.<br> - I'm so glad you liked them.<br> Sit down, kid.<br> Mr. Burley wants to buy your contract<br> from me.<br> I told you I wasn't giving up.<br> You really think I'm ready for the Tivoli?<br> Yes, but what's more important,<br> Baldini thinks so.<br> What do you say, kid?<br> Would you like to sell my contract,<br> Mr. Norton?<br> Nope.<br> I'm very sorry. I can't accept.<br> Too bad, Burley.<br> I hope I can do you a favor some time.<br> Thanks, Norton.<br> Would you thank Signor Baldini for me?<br> You've both been more than kind.<br> It's been a pleasure.<br> And I hope to show you another side<br> of San Francisco, if I may.<br> Thank you.<br> - Goodbye, Norton.<br> - So long.<br> You wouldn't take $5,000<br> to tear up that contract, would you?<br> - Nope.<br> - $10,000?<br> What are you trying to do?<br> Make an impression?<br> I told him he could have your contract<br> for nothing...<br> if you wanted to leave me.<br> I'm afraid the Tivoli<br> will have to struggle along, Burley.<br> Did you do that, Blackie?<br> Sure. You made your own choice, kid.<br> And I hope you'll never be sorry,<br> Miss Blake. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> That was awfully generous of you.<br> About the contract, I mean.<br> Oh, forget it. Say, look, kid.<br> You've heard a lot<br> about the Tivoli opera house...<br> from a bunch of mugs<br> that never get anywhere.<br> Now I'm going to tip you off<br> to a few facts about The Paradise.<br> Come on.<br> - Never been in here, have you?<br> - No.<br> Well, I don't do much office work,<br> but here's where I keep my records.<br> Take a hinge at those cups.<br> Every year, the wine agents in town...<br> Freddie Duane and all the rest of them<br> pull off an event called the Chicken's Ball.<br> - Did you ever hear of it?<br> - No.<br> I thought not.<br> You know what happens at that ball?<br> They have a competition<br> and give a prize of $10,000 in gold...<br> to the proprietor of the joint<br> who puts on the most artistic show.<br> And you know the joint<br> that's won it three times running?<br> The Paradise.<br> - Well, that's fine.<br> - Yep, for artistic achievement.<br> That's what they said in the speech<br> when they slipped me the trophy.<br> Artistic achievement.<br> - That's wonderful.<br> - Well, isn't that telling you?<br> I'm gonna win it the next time, too.<br> And the dough<br> goes to the campaign fund...<br> for those little mugs<br> down here on the Coast.<br> You know,<br> I like to look into those big lamps of yours.<br> You know, if you ever decide to cut<br> any of this, I'll put some in my watch.<br> I'm crazy about you, kid.<br> You know it, don't you?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You look kind of scared.<br> - I guess maybe I am.<br> - Of what?<br> - You.<br> Are you sure it's me you're afraid of?<br> Well, kid. What do you think<br> we ought to do about it?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nothing?<br> Because you don't want to, maybe.<br> If that's it, don't be afraid to spill it,<br> and we'll call it a day.<br> - Oh, but it isn't right.<br> - What isn't right?<br> For a man and a woman<br> to be stuck on each other?<br> Have you anything better than that<br> out in Colorado?<br> If you have, I'd like to take a whirl at it.<br> It must be immense.<br> How does it feel to feel like a woman<br> and be afraid of it?<br> Oh, Blackie, listen.<br> If you're going to preach, Mary,<br> please sing.<br> That's what I believe in.<br> Your voice. The way you move.<br> The way you stand<br> on those pretty little feet of yours.<br> That's what I believe in.<br> Don't you believe in anything<br> more than that?<br> - What more is there?<br> - God.<br> God?<br> Hey, isn't he supposed to be taking care<br> of the suckers...<br> that come out of the missions...<br> Iooking for something to eat<br> and a place to sleep?<br> I've seen them down on their knees<br> asking for things...<br> they should stand up and fight for.<br> I don't see God coming down<br> and giving the suckers a shortcut.<br> That's not what I want.<br> I want to push over the mugs<br> that stand in my way...<br> before they push me over.<br> What I believe in is not up in the air.<br> It's in here, and in here.<br> But maybe that's not right.<br> Maybe it's not right to feel alive,<br> like you and I feel this minute.<br> But I think it's right.<br> You know, Mary, I want to get a kick<br> out of things I can see.<br> Like lights on the harbor, or a good fight,<br> or a woman worth looking at.<br> Did you ever taste a fog in your mouth<br> like it was salt...<br> or take hold of someone<br> and feel your blood rushing up like a river?<br> What more does a man need,<br> or a woman, either?<br> You know, I never tried to kid you, Mary.<br> You take me as I am, or you don't take me.<br> Tim doesn't try to change me,<br> because he knows he can't...<br> and you can't, either.<br> Nothing can.<br> You know what I've been waiting for?<br> I've been waiting to hear you say<br> that I'm all right with you the way I am.<br> Maybe you're ready to say it now.<br> Are you?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, it's about time.<br> It's going to be swell, baby.<br> I'll make you queen of the Coast.<br> You'll ride through town<br> in your own carriage...<br> and everybody will know who you are.<br> I'll plaster your name and face<br> clear to the Golden Gate.<br> You and I together, Mary...<br> are gonna find out<br> that we don't need anything else but us.<br> Look.<br> How about going upstairs<br> and having some chop suey, huh?<br> Come on.<br> Will you watch me,<br> and keep your mind on my feet?<br> Watch this wing.<br> See? That's it.<br> Then you do a sort of a...<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Come on, let's...<br> Yeah, that's right, Trixie.<br> You can knock off.<br> Everybody's gonna have champagne<br> on me!<br> Dig up some of that Pommery Sec<br> for the boys and girls.<br> All we've got is Semillon.<br> That champagne<br> is starting to make me fizzy.<br> Fast or a guy gets killed.<br> Can I order you some breakfast, Blackie?<br> No, thanks. Mary and I are gonna have<br> some chop suey upstairs.<br> Mary, I have another new number<br> I'd like to have you try out.<br> Oh, no, no. Not this morning.<br> Hey, Mat! Tell Charlie to...<br> No, never mind. I'll tell him myself.<br> Stay right here, honey.<br> I won't be a minute.<br> Gee, I haven't had any champagne since...<br> Nice going, sister. You done all right.<br> Knock off there, Maggie.<br> You're going to have champagne.<br> - Me, too?<br> - Well, I'd like to know why not.<br> Mr. Blackie, I haven't had any of that<br> for a long time.<br> Well, you're gonna have some right now.<br> Here's to Blackie!<br> All right, drink.<br> - Where's Mary?<br> - I guess she went upstairs to set the table.<br> And here's to you, darling.<br> And I wish I had me youth.<br> I wish I'd never had mine.<br> - Nix, nix, Trix.<br> - Why, Trixie. That's not nice, baby.<br> Tell Mary here's to her!<br> - Babe.<br> - Yeah.<br> - When that runs out, open up some more.<br> - You bet I will.<br> Tell Mary here's to her, Blackie.<br> Sure. "Everyone to his own taste,"<br> the old lady said as she kissed the cow.<br> Ain't that a...<br> What's the matter, no sense of humor?<br> Oh, Blackie!<br> Hello, Tim.<br> I just came over to talk to you<br> about the campaign, kid.<br> Oh, well, look, Tim,<br> do you mind coming back a little later?<br> Sure. Sure.<br> By the way, Blackie, I just saw Mary.<br> Yeah. I put her in a cab.<br> She said to tell you goodbye...<br> and that she was taking you up on<br> your offer to let her out of that contract.<br> What? What's that?<br> Well, you said she could go, didn't you?<br> - Well, yes, but...<br> - She's gone to the Tivoli.<br> And I'm glad you did it, Blackie.<br> This was no place for her.<br> - Oh, you think not, eh?<br> - Of course not.<br> Neither did you, did you?<br> I guess you think she's better off<br> at the Tivoli...<br> under the management<br> of Jack Burley, huh?<br> She'll be safe with Burley, Blackie.<br> You see, she doesn't love him.<br> Hey, look, Tim.<br> You like chop suey, don't you?<br> - Chop... Sure.<br> - Come upstairs. We're gonna have some.<br> - Good evening, ladies.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> Good evening, and get out.<br> The child has a performance to give.<br> Oh, no, please.<br> We've got to thank him for all this.<br> Do let him stay.<br> - Alone, I suppose.<br> - That's right.<br> Come on, Louise.<br> In my day, the opera came first.<br> - My mother's out there tonight, Mary.<br> - Is she?<br> Yes, she came all the way back<br> from New York.<br> I guess she got tired of reading about you<br> in my letters.<br> Well, in a few hours, you'll be famous.<br> Before the whole town is at your feet,<br> I want to put in my bid.<br> I love you, Mary,<br> and I want you to marry me.<br> I've always wanted you,<br> from the moment I first set eyes on you...<br> but I didn't realize then how I wanted you.<br> - Well, I...<br> - Please don't try to answer me now.<br> I just wanted you to know how I felt.<br> Good luck, darling.<br> - How you do, Mr. Burley?<br> - Good evening.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Burley?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> - How are you, Mr. Burley?<br> - Fine, thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll be right with you, darling.<br> Want to take a look out front.<br> Hello, there, Mr. Burley.<br> - Hello, there.<br> - Jonathan.<br> - What a thrilling first night.<br> - I hope so.<br> Good evening, Mr. Burley.<br> - We can't wait to hear the new star.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Hello, Jack.<br> - Hello.<br> - Have you seen Signor Baldini?<br> - Not yet, sir.<br> - Hello, Jack. Big night, eh?<br> - I hope so, Senator.<br> - Hi.<br> - Good evening.<br> Hello, Norton.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - I didn't know you were a first-nighter.<br> - I am tonight. I came to close you up.<br> - You came to what?<br> - Close you up.<br> You got a girl appearing here<br> that's under contract to me.<br> No, you're wrong.<br> You abrogated that contract.<br> You gave her permission to leave.<br> Sure, sure, I gave her a choice,<br> and she said she'd stay with me.<br> So the contract stands.<br> Look. See that man over there?<br> The one with the big black mustache?<br> Well, that big, stupid-Iooking man<br> represents the law...<br> and he's got a piece of paper<br> in his pocket...<br> that's going to stop your prima donna...<br> right in the middle of her first cantata.<br> - Now, isn't that just awful?<br> - You wouldn't do that.<br> Well, I'm sorry, Burley,<br> but I thoughtlessly got the man started...<br> and I can't do a thing with him.<br> - Well, I guess I'll get my star.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> She doesn't go on till the second act.<br> What? Now that's not<br> very good showmanship.<br> We'll wait. I don't want to listen<br> to those others mugs.<br> Well, while you're waiting,<br> would you have a cigar?<br> Yeah, thanks.<br> Pardon me. I'll get them.<br> Excuse me. I want to speak to Mr. Baldini.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Sure.<br> What is it?<br> Hello? Hello, Central. Fillmore, 2871.<br> Norton's outside with the Sheriff<br> to stop Mary Blake.<br> - Stop her?<br> - Yes. During the performance.<br> He can't do that.<br> Hello, is Mr. Davis there? Maybe he can.<br> Hello, Davis? This is Jack Burley.<br> I want you to hurry over<br> to the Tivoli Opera House...<br> with a restraining order<br> to hold up a process.<br> What's that? I don't care<br> if the office closed 10 hours ago. Find him.<br> But I've got to have it.<br> - But what is it?<br> - You go backstage. I'll see what I can do.<br> - Well, here you are, Norton.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> - Have a peanut?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Cameo here, huh?<br> - Yes.<br> I didn't think you knew that brand<br> down at The Paradise.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> You know, you needn't have bothered<br> to call up Davis, Burley.<br> I could have told you that deputy of his<br> was away on a deep-sea fishing trip.<br> He's just crazy about fishing,<br> so I chartered him a boat.<br> How about you and I make a deal?<br> I'll give you $15,000 for that contract.<br> Well, I'd like to oblige you, Burley,<br> but, you see, the thing is out of my hands.<br> That process server is the meanest man<br> west of the Rocky Mountains.<br> He'd push his mother off a ferry boat<br> for half a dollar.<br> Yeah, he'd turn the air off<br> in a baby's incubator...<br> just to watch the little sucker squirm.<br> Well, Jim, what do you say?<br> The quicker I stop her,<br> the quicker we get home.<br> Remind me not to order any of these<br> for The Paradise.<br> Right.<br> That's kind of pretty, ain't it?<br> Yeah.<br> Sit down.<br> Hey, what's the idea?<br> I didn't come to this opera<br> to hear the opera.<br> Sit down.<br> Blackie, I think she's great.<br> Yeah, not bad.<br> Seems a kind of shame<br> to choke her off, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> He's gone around back.<br> It's all right.<br> There's nothing to worry about. Just him.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you so much. Darling!<br> Wonderful!<br> - Blackie.<br> - Hello, kid.<br> - Madame Albani...<br> - Oh, I understand.<br> It looks like Burley's<br> getting a little careless...<br> putting things down on paper.<br> Yes. He's asked me to marry him.<br> No. On the level?<br> You know, you were all right tonight, kid.<br> - Did you really think so, Blackie?<br> - Yes.<br> Say, who am I to hold out<br> against these 3,000 mugs...<br> that went goofy over you?<br> See, I never caught<br> this opera racket up to now.<br> - How long has that been going on?<br> - Only about 150 years.<br> No fooling?<br> Well, it's all right.<br> You know, I was proud of you tonight.<br> - Is that all?<br> - AII?<br> - Don't you love me?<br> - Sure, sure.<br> Well, you haven't said so.<br> Well, I love you, kid.<br> Do you know, I never sprang that line<br> but once, 25 years ago.<br> Who was she?<br> Just a girl I knew. I haven't seen her lately.<br> She's up in San Quentin.<br> So I'm the second?<br> No, you're the first.<br> Will you marry me, Blackie?<br> Marry you?<br> Well, I'm a sucker.<br> If you ain't the most domestic woman...<br> Well, I suppose if that's the only thing<br> in the world would make you happy.<br> You know,<br> the gang always said I'd be a sucker.<br> Oh, Blackie.<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello, Blackie. How are you, boy?<br> - Feeling pretty fit.<br> - Mary, you were great.<br> - Thank you.<br> I had to battle my way through<br> half of San Francisco to get here.<br> Father Tim, Blackie and I,<br> we're going to be married.<br> Yup. That's right.<br> The little girl harpooned me.<br> Well, I guess you know how I feel about it,<br> don't you, Mary?<br> So she harpooned you, huh?<br> A girl that any man in San Francisco<br> would give his right arm for...<br> but she had to harpoon you.<br> Blackie, I'm not going to wish you<br> the best of everything...<br> because you've got it already.<br> Thanks, Tim.<br> Now I know you folks<br> would like me to stay...<br> but I really have to go.<br> Really. I'm sorry.<br> - Of course if you insist, I could stay.<br> - Will you get out?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Sorry, Father.<br> Mary, you haven't changed yet.<br> Well, Norton.<br> I just thought I'd come back<br> and congratulate my fiance.<br> Your...<br> I'm sorry, Jack.<br> Gee, you better get out of that rig, baby.<br> The gang are waiting<br> to celebrate your homecoming.<br> - Where?<br> - Down home in The Paradise.<br> They're waiting<br> to hear you sing San Francisco.<br> - At The Paradise?<br> - Yeah.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You don't mean to say that you're going<br> to send her back there now?<br> Well, sure.<br> What kind of a chump do you think I am?<br> I'm going to marry her, ain't I?<br> Well, what do you want, kid?<br> Me or this?<br> - Evening, Father.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Great business tonight.<br> - Tell Mr. Norton I'd like to see him.<br> Thank you.<br> - Blackie back here?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Where do you think? In there.<br> Come in.<br> Gee, she looks pretty sharp, huh?<br> She's all right.<br> Say, Blackie, Father Tim's out there.<br> He wants to see you.<br> Well, all right. Bring him back.<br> Okay.<br> - You know, you're a funny kid.<br> - Why?<br> Why, the way you act, anyone would think<br> that it wasn't becoming.<br> - Are you happy?<br> - Yes. Yes, yes, I'm happy.<br> That's good.<br> Blackie, Blackie,<br> let's set the date for our wedding now...<br> so we can tell Father Tim<br> when he comes in.<br> Yeah, sure. Any time.<br> Oh, but, look, it's got to be after election.<br> Really?<br> Sure, sure, the mob down here know<br> how I've always kidded that sort of thing.<br> I can't back down now...<br> and make a fool of myself<br> just before election.<br> It would lose me too many votes.<br> It means a lot to me<br> to win this fight, honey.<br> Not just for putting it over on Burley,<br> but for the Coast.<br> You understand?<br> Yes. Yes, I do. I do understand.<br> But the first chance I get...<br> we'll sneak off to Sacramento...<br> and I'll let you slip the halter on me.<br> Say, I never thought<br> I'd be so goofy about anyone.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello, Tim.<br> - Good evening, Father.<br> What's wrong?<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> Why?<br> Showing Mary like this<br> to that mob out there.<br> Like this? What's wrong with her?<br> What's wrong with her?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> What's wrong with my being proud<br> to show her off?<br> Blackie, don't you understand<br> what I'm trying to tell you?<br> Wait a minute, Tim.<br> I'm making her queen of the Coast.<br> You see those posters there?<br> Five thousand of them will be plastered...<br> all over San Francisco<br> by tomorrow morning.<br> And 10,000 other ones for ashcans<br> and the front of trolley cars.<br> I'm not going to let you do this, Blackie.<br> I don't get you, Tim.<br> You never butted in on me before.<br> Well, I am now.<br> You're not going to exploit this girl.<br> Come here, Mary.<br> Will you tell his holiness...<br> that you made up your own mind<br> to come back?<br> I love him, Father.<br> That isn't love, Mary.<br> Is that so? Well, it happens to suit me.<br> It isn't love to let him<br> drag you down to his level.<br> Say, wait a minute, Tim.<br> I'm going to marry her.<br> Not if I can stop you,<br> you're not going to marry her.<br> You can't take a woman in marriage<br> and then sell her immortal soul.<br> Immortal soul?<br> Now, look, I don't go for<br> that kind of talk, Tim.<br> Don't believe in that nonsense<br> and never have.<br> You better get back to the half-wits<br> that do.<br> Blake's on next.<br> Come on, Mary. Come with me.<br> Just one minute. I'm running this joint.<br> You take care of your suckers.<br> I'll take care of mine.<br> She's not going out there.<br> I've listened to this psalm-singing blather<br> of yours for years and never squawked.<br> You can't bring it in here. This is my joint!<br> Miss Blake. Miss Mary Blake.<br> She's not going out there.<br> The place is crazy without you.<br> Get out there, kid.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You leave now,<br> and you're never coming back.<br> Hey, Blackie. Hey, Blackie, it's Burley.<br> He's giving the joint the works.<br> - I told you, you can't buck a guy like...<br> - Shut up.<br> Blackie, come on. Take a gander at this<br> thing, will you? Look at it. Come on.<br> Hey, Blackie, break it up!<br> Look what they're doing to our joint.<br> You see what they're doing, Blackie?<br> - Good afternoon, Mr. Burley.<br> - Good afternoon, Allen.<br> - Mrs. Burley in?<br> - Yes, sir. She's in the small salon.<br> - What do you think of our little shack?<br> - But it's magnificent.<br> We really only have one real treasure.<br> She's waiting to meet you.<br> You needn't sneak up on me.<br> I know you're there.<br> Mary.<br> This is my mother.<br> - How do you do, my dear?<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Burley?<br> Well, Maisie,<br> have you been in the house all day?<br> Oh, sure, I just got back from the races.<br> Why, you're even prettier close to<br> than you were from me box at the Tivoli.<br> - So are you, Mrs. Burley.<br> - Go on with you. Get out.<br> - Get out? Me?<br> - Certainly you.<br> If I have to sell this amazing,<br> beautiful creature...<br> the idea of joining the Burley family...<br> sure I got to tell her lies about us that,<br> heaven help me...<br> no son should hear his mother speak.<br> Will you call me<br> as soon as you've made the sale?<br> Get out! Get out!<br> - Sit down, my dear. Take off your coat.<br> - Thank you.<br> Now tell me,<br> why won't you marry my boy?<br> Mrs. Burley, you belong to the aristocracy<br> of San Francisco.<br> I'm just the daughter of a country parson.<br> I haven't had the advantage<br> Jack deserves in a wife.<br> Wait a minute, darling.<br> I didn't mean what I said just now<br> about telling lies.<br> You and I are gonna speak the truth<br> to each other.<br> I think I know what it's all about.<br> It's that rapscallion, Blackie Norton,<br> you were working for...<br> down on Pacific Street.<br> Now listen, Mary.<br> I'm an old lady,<br> and I've been through a lot in my life.<br> I came to San Francisco<br> in the winter of '51...<br> in a sailing vessel around the Horn.<br> When I got here,<br> there were 150 males to one female.<br> And if I do say it, I shouldn't,<br> I wasn't so hard to look at.<br> I started business in a shack<br> near Portsmouth Square doing washing.<br> Do you know<br> how long me business lasted?<br> No.<br> About 45 minutes.<br> They busted me tub to smithereens,<br> and there was a free-for-all fight...<br> between five of the big swells of the town<br> to see which one would take me to lunch.<br> So, you see, I got to know men.<br> I knew all kinds in them early days...<br> and among them was a man<br> like Blackie Norton.<br> He was a selfish and sinful...<br> and adorable scoundrel.<br> So, you see,<br> I've had my Blackie Norton, too.<br> And you gave him up?<br> Yes, yes, I gave him up.<br> Because he was killing me soul.<br> Killing your soul?<br> And I pulled myself together,<br> and one day I married Burley.<br> Burley was a good, solid man.<br> He never got used to wearing his coat<br> till the day he died.<br> But he built me this mansion...<br> and every cuspidor of the place<br> was 18-carat gold.<br> And there came a time<br> when I was glad I married him...<br> because he loved me.<br> After a while, Jack was born,<br> and I had me peace.<br> Look, Mary, you say<br> we're the aristocracy of San Francisco.<br> We are.<br> Listen.<br> Come here, Mary.<br> Listen to that.<br> That's the McDonough mansion.<br> Aristocrats.<br> And that party's been going on<br> for two days and nights straight running.<br> There isn't a rougher joint<br> on the whole Barbary Coast...<br> than that home right here on Nob Hill.<br> They call this<br> the wickedest city in the world...<br> and it's a bitter shame, it is.<br> For deep down underneath<br> all our evil and sin...<br> we've got right here in San Francisco<br> the finest set of human beings...<br> that was ever rounded up on one spot.<br> Sure, they had to have<br> wild adventure in their hearts...<br> and dynamite in their blood<br> to set out for here in the first place.<br> That's why they're so full<br> of untamed deviltry now.<br> But we can't go on like this.<br> Sinful and blasphemous,<br> with no fear for God in our hearts.<br> That's the reason why I want my boy<br> to have a good woman near him...<br> and raise fine, beautiful kids<br> for the glory of our heritage.<br> You can make a fine man of him.<br> And maybe one day...<br> you'll be proud<br> that you met up with the family...<br> of old Maisie Burley, the washerwoman.<br> - I'm glad I know you now, Mrs. Burley.<br> - Maisie to you, darling.<br> Maisie.<br> Jiggers! Jiggers! The joint's pinched!<br> - Wait a minute. Where you going?<br> - It's closing here.<br> It's gonna be closed, so where you going?<br> - Hey, what's the big idea?<br> - Go on, you kids. Get back to the stage.<br> - Get out!<br> - Come on!<br> - No rough stuff now. Nobody get hurt.<br> - Good evening, Charlie.<br> - Good evening, lad. Sorry I have to do this.<br> - What's the charge?<br> - Serving liquor without a license.<br> - We've got a license!<br> - It's been revoked.<br> - What'll the rap be, Charlie?<br> Probably $5,000 fine and a year in jail.<br> - You know Judge Cardigan.<br> - Yeah, I know him.<br> But Burley knows him better.<br> I'd like to help you, but you know<br> I have me wife and me kids to care for.<br> Yes, yes. I understand, Charlie.<br> Look, I've been counting on winning<br> that prize money from the Chicken's Ball.<br> Will you give me a couple hours to rustle<br> up bail and get my entertainers out?<br> Well...<br> How about being at the station<br> before 6:00 in the morning?<br> Okay, I'll be there. Thanks.<br> It's an outrage.<br> Burley's timed this so that<br> you can't cop that prize money tonight.<br> - Come on, Babe, let's take a ride.<br> - Will you bring me back?<br> - That's up to him.<br> - I'll have you all out in plenty of time.<br> Well, Blackie, had enough?<br> - Hello. What's eating you?<br> - We can't fight Burley, Blackie.<br> So he's got you buffaloed, eh?<br> It's tough, but if we trail along with you<br> we'll get just what you're getting.<br> And none of us can afford to be raided.<br> I'm not here on my own.<br> The boys sent me.<br> The district's full of little mugs who<br> are counting on me to go through for 'em.<br> - And I'm going through.<br> - Now wait a minute.<br> You haven't done any business<br> since they started raiding you.<br> Where are you going to get the money<br> to carry on your campaign?<br> Whoever wins that $10,000 tonight<br> could carry us clear through the campaign.<br> - Not if I win it.<br> - Why not? It's a good investment.<br> We'll build a new Coast that'll top<br> anything San Francisco's ever known.<br> The old Coast has been<br> pretty good to me, Blackie, yes...<br> and it's been pretty good to you, too.<br> Up to now.<br> Well, I'm not going to quit.<br> Are you fighting for the Coast, or are<br> you fighting Burley for a personal reason?<br> We think that it's personal. And we've had<br> a bellyful of this boudoir battle.<br> So long.<br> Get away! Don't you dare take my purse!<br> - Want anything from inside, Blackie?<br> - What?<br> No.<br> Well, I guess I might as well<br> turn out the lights.<br> By golly, that's right.<br> There's no use of running up your light bill.<br> You can't do that!<br> You know, that's the first time<br> the joint's ever been locked.<br> I threw the key away the night it opened.<br> See you before 6:00, Blackie.<br> Come on, let's get going here, now.<br> Come on.<br> - Come on. Break it up.<br> - Paper!<br> Get your early morning paper!<br> - Hiya, Blackie.<br> - Oh, hello, Bill.<br> - Have a paper.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> That's all right. It's on me tonight.<br> Paper!<br> Get your paper! Early morning edition!<br> - Hey, hey, wait a minute.<br> - Oh, you're jealous.<br> That's the matter with you.<br> - Mary, I love you.<br> - I'm glad.<br> Mr. Burley, the caterers are here<br> from the Poodledog Restaurant.<br> Fine. Have them put the tables<br> on the stage.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - You'd better look after things, dear.<br> - Right, as usual.<br> Oh, wait. You forgot to ask<br> the stagehands for the banquet.<br> - Did I?<br> - I asked them.<br> Darling.<br> - All right, boys. Let's start the music.<br> - Father Mullin.<br> - Mary.<br> - Were you out front tonight?<br> Your last night?<br> I'm glad someone of the old crowd<br> remember me.<br> I got my invitation to your wedding, Mary.<br> - Are you coming?<br> - Of course.<br> Good.<br> Mary, are you happy?<br> Yes. Yes, I'm happy.<br> Then everything's all right.<br> - Good night, my dear.<br> - Won't you stay and join our party?<br> No, I'm sorry. I must run along.<br> Well, good night.<br> God bless you.<br> Is madame tired?<br> No, no. I'm quite all right, thank you.<br> Come in.<br> - They're calling for you, dear.<br> - But I've got to change.<br> Don't bother now.<br> Change before we go to the ball.<br> - The ball?<br> - Why, sure.<br> We're going to wind up<br> at the Chicken's Ball.<br> - Oh, no, Jack.<br> - Why not?<br> - Well, I...<br> - That's all right, dear.<br> I happen to know<br> that Blackie Norton won't be there.<br> "Eat, drink and be merry,<br> for tomorrow you die."<br> - Dead men don't have any fun.<br> - That's right.<br> Alice, look what I found<br> in one of the dressing rooms.<br> Well, I can recommend him, honey.<br> He's my cousin.<br> Good evening.
