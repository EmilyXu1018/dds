                        This is the story of a squad<br> of marines, a rifle squad.<br> I'm Corporal Robert Dunne,<br> a member of that squad.<br> We were at Guadalcanal,<br> and when it was declared secure<br> we were pulled out for rest, refitting,<br> replacements and retraining.<br> The Marine Corps is long on training<br> and retraining...<br> Let that go.<br> After the canal, we were sent to<br> Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.<br> Here we received our replacements,<br> marines from Stateside,<br> a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.<br> I can see you're a man<br> who knows how to live.<br> - Solid comfort.<br> - Solid malaria son.<br> - Malaria, huh? Contagious?<br> - No, not this week. You can stay.<br> Nice place you got here.<br> Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.<br> Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.<br> Great. Meet my friends. This big guy<br> is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.<br> - Hi.<br> - What a physique!<br> The girls see him and faint. He comes<br> through this, I'll make him a movie star!<br> Those two guys, Flynns.<br> That's Eddie and that's Frank.<br> - Hi, Eddie.<br> - Hello, Bob.<br> They don't drink. I got their beer ration.<br> - And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.<br> - Hello, sport.<br> - Where did you get those cards?<br> - Off your sack on the ship. Why?<br> - They're mine, that's why.<br> - I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.<br> - Come on, give me.<br> - "Semper fi", Mac.<br> - Hey!<br> - Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.<br> You know where those guys come from?<br> Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.<br> - By the way, who's the squad leader?<br> - Sergeant Stryker.<br> - What's he like?<br> - You'll find out.<br> I've been in New Zealand two hours<br> and already they're clamming up on me.<br> - I hope he knows his stuff.<br> - Maybe we'll get liberty.<br> - We ain't replacements any more.<br> - Where is he? Where's the sergeant?<br> He's here.<br> - Well, what do you know? Stryker.<br> - Hello, Thomas.<br> - Thought you were in the First.<br> - I was. Sit down.<br> Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.<br> My name is Stryker,<br> Sergeant John M Stryker.<br> You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.<br> Three of us have seen action: Corporal<br> Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.<br> You'll learn from us. In boot camp<br> you learned out of a book.<br> Here you gotta remember the book and<br> learn things that haven't been printed.<br> You gotta learn right and fast.<br> Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,<br> I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.<br> Before I'm through with you, you're<br> gonna move and think like one man.<br> If you don't, you'll be dead.<br> You guys have had a nice easy day.<br> I hope you enjoyed it because<br> it's the last one you'll get for a long time.<br> You joined the Marines to fight and<br> you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.<br> If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach you<br> another. But I'll get the job done.<br> The skipper of this outfit<br> is Captain Joyce.<br> Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.<br> Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.<br> Any questions?<br> That's all.<br> and I draw Stryker!<br> You knew this guy before?<br> Yeah. We were stationed<br> together in China.<br> Twice he kept me from promotion.<br> Turned me in once.<br> He was a sergeant major then.<br> Must have done something to get busted<br> to three stripes.<br> What did he turn you in for?<br> For... That's not important!<br> What's important is that he turned me in!<br> Maybe he didn't write the manual, but<br> you can bet he can recite it backwards!<br> - It's probably tattooed on his chest.<br> - Front and back, Mac.<br> - Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Weren't you a fighter?<br> - Just in the Marines.<br> - Runner-up in the heavyweight division.<br> - Tell him who you were runner-up to.<br> Stryker. Lucky punch.<br> Meet your new manager.<br> Tell him why you lost your stripes.<br> My natural dislike for you is<br> gradually developing into a great hate.<br> Don't let this guy do your thinking.<br> You'll get a square deal from Stryker.<br> You bet. Square deal.<br> I'm looking forward to the first time<br> he and I come head to head off duty.<br> Hey, take it easy<br> with that hand, champ!<br> Saddle up!<br> - All right, take a break.<br> - Take a break.<br> - How does your squad look?<br> - See me in about six months. Conway!<br> I was checking the records.<br> Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.<br> - What if he was?<br> - I was with him ten months ago.<br> He was my CO before he got killed.<br> One of the best officers and finest men<br> I ever served under.<br> - I thought if you...<br> - Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.<br> - For that, you sleep with your rifle.<br> - It was an accident.<br> - Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.<br> - Fall in!<br> All right, saddle up. Pick it up.<br> Sometimes I don't know<br> which I hate worse, him or the Nips.<br> - Your father was a good marine.<br> - Until ten months ago.<br> - You shipped in when he was killed.<br> - I shipped in because I was expected to.<br> In war the men of my family<br> join the Marines.<br> I'm the last Conway, so here I am.<br> He'd be proud that<br> you're carrying on the tradition.<br> Not my father. He'd have expected me<br> to find some soft duty somewhere.<br> - In fact, he told me so.<br> - I don't get it.<br> I embarrassed my father. I wasn't<br> tough enough for him. Too soft.<br> "No guts" was the phrase he used.<br> He wanted me to be like Stryker.<br> "The finest man I ever served under. "<br> I bet they got along just fine.<br> Both with ramrods strapped on their<br> backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.<br> They're not going to strap one on mine.<br> I'm in here strictly for tradition.<br> - That the only reason?<br> - Yeah. Why?<br> Nothing... Stryker knows his business.<br> So did Jack the Ripper.<br> Knock off the skylarking.<br> You're in the wrong column.<br> Left foot close in there.<br> Look alive!<br> Choynski, you're all left feet!<br> Choynski! What do you think<br> you're doing?<br> - Running the bayonet course, sir.<br> - Not in this league.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.<br> Yes, sir.<br> That ought to take some starch<br> out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.<br> Hanging him up between those poles,<br> we'd do a lot better.<br> Choynski!<br> OK, so I'm left-handed.<br> - On guard. Give me your rifle.<br> - What is this?<br> You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn<br> the hard way. Make a thrust.<br> - Without a scabbard?<br> - You heard me.<br> - You mean this way?<br> - Yeah, like this!<br> You get the idea? Corpsman!<br> All right, saddle up.<br> We'll do it again. Pick it up.<br> You're the only unkissable guy in camp.<br> This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's<br> going to come near a mouth like this.<br> Don't worry, I got the scoop.<br> No liberty for three months. You got time.<br> - Three months? How did you get that?<br> - I got spies everywhere.<br> They ought to throw the book at Stryker<br> for doing this.<br> They won't. They'll give him a citation<br> for teaching us to be good marines.<br> Choynski!<br> They tell me you're going to live.<br> You were lucky today.<br> Someone had been instructing you that<br> didn't like you, you might not have been.<br> You better put in a little homework<br> on that bayonet course.<br> Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder<br> what he does to the guys he hates.<br> I gotta pick this one to nick myself!<br> You need a blow torch on your stubble.<br> Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.<br> No liberty, he says!<br> Somebody made a mistake.<br> You got no kick coming.<br> You have, so don't go turning your back.<br> Will we take Hollywood<br> with them physiques!<br> - First Platoon!<br> - That's for me!<br> - Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?<br> - No.<br> It's going to be rugged again tonight.<br> He won't solve his problems<br> with whiskey.<br> What would you do<br> if your wife left with your kid?<br> - After five years I'd forget it.<br> - Stryker's not much on forgetting.<br> - Sorry, no letter for you.<br> - I know it.<br> You know ten-year-olds. There could be<br> a thousand reasons why he didn't write.<br> - A million.<br> - Cut it out.<br> - Cut what out?<br> - Brushing me. The kid's all right.<br> - Maybe Mary influenced him not to.<br> - That she wouldn't do.<br> Of course not.<br> Stryker, you're a very unusual character.<br> - Can this be love?<br> - You know what I mean.<br> A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman<br> needs a husband who's not always away.<br> A woman wants a home and a guy<br> to come in and out on time every day.<br> - You can tell me to shut up.<br> - If you can't talk to me, who can?<br> - Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.<br> - Do what?<br> Don't start out to get blind, staggering,<br> stinking, falling down drunk.<br> Nobody starts out to get blind,<br> staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.<br> Some do. Why not leave<br> half your dough with me?<br> You got an old maid's failings. You worry.<br> Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put<br> a dent in that ugly head of yours.<br> - Ready?<br> - Just a minute.<br> - What's up?<br> - Nothing.<br> Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough<br> for Stryker, so he turned him in.<br> They cancelled his liberty.<br> Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart<br> of gold after all, but he certainly is...<br> You talk too much. You think I restricted<br> Flynn for my own amusement?<br> The punishment's unreasonable,<br> to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.<br> I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.<br> I'm gonna tell all of you.<br> I'm gonna make it simple<br> so you'll all understand it.<br> They handed me you guys as a present,<br> a regular Easter basket.<br> They told me to get you into shape<br> so you can handle a piece of this war.<br> That's what I'm gonna do and that means<br> I'm gonna tell you what to do every day,<br> how to button your buttons<br> and when to blow your noses.<br> If you do something I don't like I'm gonna<br> jump and when I land it'll hurt.<br> I'll ride you until you can't stand up.<br> When you do, you'll be marines.<br> Flynn stays here.<br> Extra-hard product of a hard school.<br> Tough luck, Flynn.<br> - If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.<br> - Shut up!<br> - Who are you telling to shut up?<br> - You!<br> Let's go before we all lose our liberty.<br> I wanna see those Wellington babes.<br> - How do you feel, boy?<br> - Like a little bird with feathers on it.<br> - Don't fly away, little bird.<br> - I can't. I'm still in the egg.<br> Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.<br> You're gonna sit down.<br> Yes, ma'am, Tennessee,<br> that's where I come from.<br> The greatest state in the Union.<br> They call it the volunteer state.<br> Right there is where I'm from.<br> Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!<br> These are all my cousins on my mama's<br> side and these are on my papa's side.<br> We got the best tobacco there is, too.<br> More fertiliser comes from Tennessee<br> than any other place in the world.<br> Listen to that band! Zombies!<br> They're all dead.<br> - Maybe they like music that way here.<br> - Or don't know any other kind.<br> - I'm talking these boys into a session.<br> - Maybe they don't have it in them.<br> After I'm through, they will.<br> They're breaking my heart.<br> Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!<br> - There is a happy man.<br> - Wait until tomorrow.<br> - Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.<br> - I'm not much on dancing.<br> - You might try just this once.<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Pete's my name, Pete Conway.<br> - Allison.<br> - Hello, Allison.<br> - Hello, Pete.<br> - You're warm. Want to sit down?<br> - No. I don't want to lose you.<br> - Cutting in.<br> - Shove off, Mac.<br> What would you say if I suggested<br> we get some air?<br> I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club<br> with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.<br> Now what?<br> We know all about each other.<br> - You'll be missing your train.<br> - I'll float back on thin air.<br> Don't do that. You might catch cold.<br> Funny, I've just met you and I feel<br> I've known you all my life.<br> I feel that way, too.<br> - Ten thousand miles away.<br> - Not now.<br> I wanna see you again,<br> every time I get liberty.<br> I'll be here.<br> - Allison...<br> - Yes?<br> ...I'm glad I met you tonight.<br> - The train...<br> - I know.<br> I'll walk you to the station.<br> I can get a taxi from there.<br> - No, I'll walk you home.<br> - No.<br> You might miss your train.<br> I might not see you again for a long time.<br> Any time I get liberty, she says, just call<br> her up. Man, what a barmaid!<br> - I'll finish the war right here.<br> - Drink any more and you probably will!<br> New Zealand ain't got rats because<br> they killed them all with that whiskey!<br> We'll drink worse before we get through.<br> They may bury me at sea tomorrow,<br> but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.<br> I got a great future<br> for the next two hours.<br> You're bleeding!<br> Lipstick!<br> - Hey, fellas, look what I found!<br> - Hey, sports...<br> ...look.<br> - Boy, he's really carrying a load!<br> - Gyrene!<br> Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.<br> - Well, what do you know! Stryker.<br> - He's sure a mess.<br> Now I know what happened<br> to those stripes. Come on.<br> Shore Patrol.<br> - That's what it is. Give me a hand.<br> - You're going to help him?<br> If he cut my mother's throat five minutes<br> ago, I wouldn't let them get him.<br> What a break! He's all set to drop two<br> stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.<br> - But look what he done to me!<br> - Don't tell me he kissed you.<br> That's a great one!<br> Did I tell you about the guy on a train<br> and the funniest thing happened...<br> - I don't know why you're helping him.<br> - I'll take care of it.<br> - Where did you come from?<br> - Never mind. He don't need you guys.<br> - How do you like that?<br> - He must follow Stryker like a little dog.<br> What do you care?<br> At least he took him off our hands.<br> A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile<br> hike over terrain carefully selected.<br> All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of<br> marines who pitched tents that night<br> and gratefully folded themselves inside.<br> Do you believe in love at first sight?<br> All kinds.<br> I never did before but I sure do now.<br> - Why do you have to tell me now?<br> - Because I'm thinking about it now.<br> - I'm gonna marry that girl.<br> - What girl?<br> - The girl I met last night.<br> - You'll feel better in the morning.<br> I couldn't feel any better<br> than I do right now.<br> I've been thinking, why do men<br> get married during a war?<br> - Don't know.<br> - It's the worst time.<br> I fooled around<br> but I never thought about marriage.<br> I know a lot of girls<br> back in the States but...<br> ...I think it's because when you get<br> out here you're close to things.<br> You realise way down inside, no matter<br> how much you try not to think about it,<br> that maybe something's<br> got your number on...<br> ...and you want to leave<br> a bit of yourself behind.<br> Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,<br> just so long as you won't be forgotten.<br> There'll be someone who'd never<br> have lived if it hadn't been for you.<br> Am I right?<br> I think I'm right.<br> - Hey, Conway, got a pass?<br> - I have.<br> All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.<br> - I hear you got a girl in town.<br> - What if I have?<br> - They say she's a very nice girl.<br> - They talk too much.<br> Are you serious about her?<br> With things the way they are, this is no<br> time to start getting serious with a girl.<br> Don't know how long you're gonna<br> be here or when you'll be back again.<br> Don't even know how long you'll live.<br> If it's in the line of duty, you can tell me<br> to do something and I'll do it.<br> As for my personal life,<br> keep your hands off.<br> - Your father would've said it.<br> - I wouldn't have listened.<br> - You never did.<br> - How do you know?<br> - He told me.<br> - What did he say?<br> I'll tell you. He said<br> I was a disappointment, right?<br> He said I wouldn't be able<br> to stand up for myself, right?<br> - You're doing the talking.<br> - No, my father is.<br> Every time you open your mouth, he's<br> talking. Every thought you think is his.<br> It's as though he's at my shoulder.<br> But he didn't always say<br> or think the right thing.<br> You're gonna find that out when the<br> time comes. Until then leave me alone.<br> - You want a lift or not?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing. Why?<br> - You've hardly said a word.<br> - You're right. I've been thinking.<br> - About us?<br> - Myself.<br> That's selfish.<br> Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?<br> - What a funny question to ask.<br> - Well, do you?<br> I don't know. Why?<br> - I've got to prove something to someone.<br> - Who?<br> You don't know him. He's dead now.<br> Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.<br> That helps. You don't know<br> how much that helps.<br> Let's not talk about it any more.<br> We should have been talking about<br> ourselves all this time,<br> what's going to happen to us.<br> - What do you want to happen?<br> - I want to marry you.<br> I want that, too.<br> Funny, we barely know each other.<br> We see each other for what seems<br> only moments. And yet...<br> I know what you mean.<br> - Choynski, not going to the wedding?<br> - No.<br> I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn<br> this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.<br> - On guard.<br> - No, Sarge, not again!<br> - I'm not well from the last time.<br> - On guard!<br> - Play that thing again. You lead.<br> - What?<br> You lead!<br> Shift your weight.<br> Left, left!<br> There. Keep it up.<br> You'll get the knack of it.<br> Practise that<br> about a half an hour every day.<br> Hey, Sarge! I got it!<br> I haven't been in church since I was 14.<br> - Kissing the bride's a great invention.<br> - Sure makes me homesick.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - He looks the same.<br> - How do you expect him to look?<br> - Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.<br> - 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!<br> - Excuse me, sports.<br> Here's your wedding present<br> from the gang.<br> You've all been wonderful.<br> - Are you sure you've got the right guy?<br> - I'm sure.<br> Come on, get going!<br> - "Sempre felice", Mac!<br> - Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!<br> We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.<br> What are we gonna do?<br> Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.<br> Knock it off! I've had a hard day.<br> What am I doing?<br> That isn't very long, is it?<br> No, not long at all.<br> I wonder how many other people<br> have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.<br> Lots I guess.<br> - We'll make it seem a long time.<br> - Years.<br> - Shall I open it?<br> - Sure, go ahead.<br> They're in a hurry!<br> Others were in a hurry.<br> The order said move out<br> and the Marines moved out.<br> Only the top brass knew.<br> Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the<br> answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.<br> Boat Squad... halt, one, two!<br> Dismissed!<br> Too bad you couldn't see her again.<br> You didn't get long.<br> We knew it might happen.<br> I'll be back. I've got to believe that.<br> - Sure. We'll all be back.<br> - Gangway!<br> That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.<br> I've got to teach you everything.<br> Now watch this...<br> What are you gonna do with this, Benny?<br> I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo,<br> right in the middle of Times Square.<br> - There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.<br> - There will be when I get there.<br> Now that's the way to fold a flag,<br> with the blue field showing.<br> What do you know!<br> - You got my shirt!<br> - It's my shirt!<br> - I'm telling you, it's my shirt!<br> - It's my shirt!<br> Here, fellas. You'd better<br> quit fighting so much.<br> If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.<br> Corpsman! Corpsman!<br> - What's that?<br> - Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.<br> Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.<br> I hope they practise real good. What<br> island do you think we're aiming at?<br> We'll get word.<br> - Here it is.<br> - It looks like a pork chop.<br> - What's its name?<br> - Tarawa.<br> Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.<br> It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.<br> This particular island is called Betio.<br> Don't ask me how you spell it.<br> You'll have to stick your faces into it<br> but you don't have to spell it.<br> - This is Red Beach Three. That's us.<br> - What have they got there?<br> Everything. This island's held<br> by a special naval landing force.<br> That means Japanese marines.<br> They're dug in and they're mean.<br> They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel<br> in a jukebox, but that's all right.<br> Let the other guy die for his country.<br> You'll live for yours.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Get over there.<br> - I can hear him.<br> Get over there. I don't want anybody<br> hurt because you didn't listen.<br> - Schoolteacher, do me some homework.<br> - What's your problem, son?<br> Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says<br> that's how many Nips are on that rock.<br> - The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.<br> - Don't forget the fly-fly boys.<br> Those B-24s have really<br> been working them over.<br> Now add the tons of explosives, divide it<br> by the Nips and get the answer.<br> - Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.<br> - Don't figure that way.<br> The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded<br> plenty on the canal before we went in.<br> When we got ashore there were still a lot<br> of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.<br> Only way that island was taken<br> was by putting marines on the beach.<br> You've heard the naval foray's a waste<br> of time and metal. Stryker knows better.<br> - Who cut you in on this conversation?<br> - You say when I can and can't talk?<br> - Just when you can't talk to me.<br> - Knock it off, Conway.<br> I've had enough of your "hardbitten<br> sergeant" attitude.<br> You're so big everybody's been afraid<br> to take a punch at you. I'm not!<br> Cool off!<br> Forget that pencil and paper routine and<br> worry about staying alive on that beach.<br> - Don't expect any soft touch!<br> - "Now hear this"!<br> All troops report<br> to your debarking stations!<br> All right, men, sound off<br> when your name's called.<br> Now hear this,<br> there'll be no movies tonight!<br> The place is opened up for business.<br> - Missed!<br> - Maybe they're firing blanks.<br> - Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.<br> - Maybe this is just manoeuvres.<br> Get out now. We're crossing the line<br> of departure. Lock and load!<br> - Good luck, Sarge!<br> - Charlie, give me a hand here!<br> Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?<br> I got hit!<br> Corpsman! You'll be all right.<br> They got us pinned down!<br> We can't get over these logs!<br> - I'm going while I can!<br> - Stay here, kid!<br> We're gonna be killed here.<br> I'd like to get at them!<br> Why rush? This is a nice place.<br> - They got the lieutenant!<br> - They'll get all of us if we don't move.<br> We are like fish in a barrel lying here.<br> - Did we train to take it lying down?<br> - Sarge, do something about it!<br> Stay where you are until I tell you.<br> You gotta get us out of here!<br> If you're nervous count your toes.<br> I'll do the masterminding around here.<br> - Where's Lieutenant Baker?<br> - Machine-gunned.<br> - Is your squad all right?<br> - All but one. What's holding us down?<br> That bunker, an old power plant. All<br> these bombs and they're still killing us.<br> - Smoke, sir?<br> - Thanks.<br> I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.<br> Your squad will support. Follow me!<br> You heard! Move out and stay down!<br> We've gotta silence that bunker!<br> Request naval gunfire<br> be lifted on target areas, coordinates...<br> ...two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.<br> Roger and out.<br> Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!<br> Demolition out!<br> Shipley!<br> Give me a hand with this pack.<br> Throw it!<br> Move out!<br> Get him out of there!<br> - There goes one of your nine.<br> - Now we got tanks.<br> Better late than never.<br> Come on!<br> Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!<br> Don't wait. They'll find me.<br> Keep going. Hit 'em for me.<br> Find Stryker. Stick with him.<br> He's good people.<br> Tell him I...<br> I'd like to know<br> where the rest of the squad went.<br> - What's this place?<br> - Whatever it is it ain't healthy!<br> Let's go!<br> That was close.<br> Next time don't be in such a hurry.<br> - You're across, ain't you?<br> - Across what? To where?<br> - I'm running low on ammo.<br> - I am too.<br> Forgot about that.<br> We gotta get some more.<br> - I'll go.<br> - Wait! Pick a number from one to six.<br> - Two.<br> - Five.<br> You're both wrong.<br> That guy kills me.<br> Thomas better hurry!<br> - How about some bandoliers, Mac?<br> - Help yourself.<br> - How are things going up front?<br> - Pretty rough.<br> - Keep it coming.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Is that coffee?<br> - It sure is. Do you want some?<br> Do I want some, he says!<br> I haven't had any joe<br> since we left the ship.<br> You mortarmen sure live<br> the life of Riley here.<br> Here you are.<br> Beautiful!<br> - Where's Thomas?<br> - Probably dead.<br> No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!<br> - Can I have some for my buddies?<br> - Sure. Break out your canteen.<br> Tell me, how's everything been going?<br> Couldn't be better, Mac.<br> Oh, this is the life!<br> Come and get it, you guys!<br> Ammo and fresh hot joe!<br> Hellenopolis!<br> Bass!<br> Hey, Greek!<br> Hey, Greek!<br> - What kepts you, Thomas?<br> - Where's Bass?<br> Gutted.<br> No ammo.<br> What kept you, sports?<br> Major Crowe, sir.<br> - Jim? How you doing?<br> - "It's tough going, Dave".<br> I've committed every man.<br> We're dug in and staying.<br> Good. I've been getting reports all day<br> that the Nips are slipping in to your front.<br> If it's "banzai" tonight,<br> target area 2-41 is a hot spot.<br> What outfit have you got there?<br> Joyce and Stryker.<br> Pass the word they gotta dig in<br> and stay put.<br> No noise or movement.<br> Don't risk anybody unless you have to.<br> Hold on until we get more men there.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Major Crowe says the Nips have been<br> filtering into these tank traps.<br> Disperse your squad along this section.<br> Tell your men there's to be no smoking,<br> no moving or unnecessary talking.<br> If they find out how thin we are,<br> they can get to the beach.<br> That's a platoon area. All I got's<br> a beat-up squad, short three men.<br> - Couldn't you...?<br> - Can I give you three men?<br> The battalion can't give the whole<br> company three replacements.<br> Your squad is covering<br> the hottest spot in the line.<br> If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you<br> first. They want to know our disposition.<br> I repeat, your men are not to move.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Stryker, we're going to hold this line.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Good luck.<br> All right, saddle up. Follow me.<br> Everybody go!<br> Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.<br> We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.<br> Don't give away your position or strength.<br> You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.<br> Dunne and Smith, drop out here.<br> No gab tonight!<br> You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.<br> Corpsman!<br> Listen.<br> - Corpsman!<br> - That's a marine.<br> Corpsman!<br> - Stryker!<br> - Get down and stay down!<br> - You had your orders!<br> - Somebody's wounded!<br> - Quiet.<br> - Let's get him!<br> Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.<br> They pulled it on the canal.<br> - It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.<br> - I don't care. You'll tip our position.<br> Stryker!<br> It's Bass!<br> How many Japs know your name?<br> - You know his voice.<br> - Shut up.<br> Aren't you human at all?<br> A friend of yours may be dying!<br> Knock it off!<br> This is what my father taught you.<br> Be a great marine, be tough.<br> Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.<br> The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.<br> That's just what I'll do!<br> Stryker!<br> Stryker!<br> Sarge!<br> Stryker!<br> Please, Sarge!<br> Tarawa was officially declared secure<br> at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.<br> The replacements came ashore,<br> our wounded were cared for<br> and the assault troops were relieved.<br> - How am I doing, Chaplain?<br> - God has been good to you.<br> You're going home.<br> Per istam Sanctam Unctionem,<br> et suam piisimam,<br> indulgeat tibi Dominus<br> "quidquid deliquisti. Amen".<br> Somebody beat me to it.<br> Skipper gave out some news.<br> Part of it's good, part of it's bad.<br> - They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.<br> - He was a good Greek.<br> Choynski, Soames and Bass are on<br> a hospital ship Stateside-bound.<br> - I wish I was with them.<br> - Let's get cleaned up.<br> Wash out those dungarees<br> and let's look like marines.<br> You too, Thomas.<br> - Dunne.<br> - Yeah?<br> I got a couple of bottles of sake<br> in my gear. Give it to the squad.<br> - Right.<br> - Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.<br> Why don't you break down a little?<br> You got it off a dead Nip.<br> Aye, aye.<br> - What's eating you?<br> - Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?<br> Another squad problem<br> and I'm so tired of problems!<br> I'm tired of Stryker!<br> I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.<br> Me, too.<br> Hey, champ, what do you think<br> of beautiful Hawaii?<br> - I don't want to talk about it.<br> - Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.<br> - Why the silence?<br> - Knock it off!<br> - Hi! You got room for me?<br> - What do you know!<br> - You got time off for good behaviour?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where were you? Pearl Harbor?<br> - Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.<br> I'll give somebody $5<br> to shoot me in the foot.<br> - I'll do it for $2.50.<br> - You're too willing!<br> Some replacements out here<br> assigned to our squad.<br> We build up the joint<br> and they come and live in it.<br> This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.<br> He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar<br> Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Nineteen.<br> - How old?<br> - Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.<br> We heard that the squad leader's tough.<br> - There are rumours to that effect.<br> - Tough sergeants roll off my knife!<br> You're gonna find your first few days<br> with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.<br> You new men come with me.<br> - Attention!<br> - Charlie! How are you?<br> - Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.<br> - Good.<br> The replacements came up with me.<br> They get younger all the time.<br> - Or we're getting older.<br> - Or both.<br> - I can stand having you back.<br> - I can stand being back.<br> What happened to the squad, besides<br> the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?<br> Choynski...<br> Thomas? He never got a scratch.<br> - I was sure he got it.<br> - Why?<br> When we got stuck in a trench he went<br> back to get ammo. Never came back.<br> How long between the time he went back<br> and you got overrun?<br> About 40 minutes.<br> Stay here.<br> Thomas!<br> - Yeah?<br> - Outside.<br> - What's that about?<br> - Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.<br> - That's far enough.<br> - What's this about?<br> Just that I hate your guts!<br> Get up.<br> You doped off and got one of my men<br> killed and one of them bayoneted!<br> - You haven't had enough. Get up!<br> - Stryker...<br> Attention! All right, break it up.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.<br> And you?<br> Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.<br> This may take some explaining before<br> a court martial. Help that man up.<br> - You'll need medical attention.<br> - I'll be OK, sir.<br> That's debatable. You know it's not<br> permissible for an NCO to strike a man?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Who struck the first blow?<br> Colonel, there wasn't any first blow<br> struck exactly.<br> A simultaneous explosion perhaps?<br> Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me<br> how to break a judo hold.<br> No more judo exhibitions.<br> Understand, Sergeant?<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> At least you're no stool pigeon.<br> Wait a minute, Stryker.<br> I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.<br> I doped off for some coffee,<br> but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.<br> - It did!<br> - I know that now, but I didn't then.<br> It's killing me. I can't sleep.<br> A hundred times I wanted to tell you,<br> tell somebody. I...<br> I liked that Greek...<br> I'd do anything for him.<br> If I could I'd change him<br> for me right now.<br> I think you would.<br> Guys make mistakes but every one<br> we make, a stack of chips goes with it.<br> We make a mistake<br> and some guy don't walk away!<br> For evermore he don't walk away.<br> I guess all we can do is just take it...<br> ...and hope we don't make<br> the same mistake again.<br> I won't.<br> Let's get back.<br> Mail call! First Platoon.<br> A letter from my wife after 18 months.<br> Know where she is?<br> In England, entertaining troops.<br> Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here<br> entertaining me? I'm a troop.<br> "They're all such nice boys. There's<br> a lieutenant here... " A lieutenant!<br> When I get back she'll need standing<br> up for a month! I put on muscle lately!<br> Darling, this is a funny way for a man<br> to find out he's a father, but you are.<br> It happened the day before yesterday,<br> just in time for breakfast.<br> He's a boy and looks beautiful like me<br> and intelligent like you.<br> I should have told you it was going to<br> happen, but I didn't want to worry you.<br> I don't know what to call him.<br> We never discussed that.<br> - I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!<br> - Let's see!<br> - I'm a father!<br> - All right, let's fall in!<br> Come on!<br> Finally we got our leave.<br> Ten days in Honolulu.<br> All of us were out on the town.<br> All except Stryker.<br> He was still the same.<br> - Lonesome?<br> - Drift.<br> - Whiskey.<br> - Two?<br> - Please.<br> - OK.<br> Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.<br> It's been a rough day...<br> Knock it off!<br> I'm sorry, Sergeant.<br> - Right.<br> - Thanks.<br> They cheat servicemen.<br> We could drink cheaper at my house.<br> Don't throw your arm out of joint.<br> Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean<br> to make too much buzzing in your ear.<br> It's all right, finish your drink.<br> - I didn't mean to sound so tough.<br> - I know. You're just unhappy.<br> Me, too.<br> My name's Mary.<br> The long arm of coincidence,<br> or something.<br> Her name, too.<br> That invitation still hold?<br> Make yourself comfortable.<br> I'll fix us a drink.<br> Oh, dear!<br> Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.<br> I see.<br> Will a sawbuck do it?<br> Go on, take it. It's only paper.<br> Well, I'll be right back.<br> - I hope this is your brand.<br> - Any brand is mine.<br> - She says she's hungry.<br> - He.<br> Advise him against joining the Marines.<br> Mummy's fixing you something. Her<br> boy'll be quiet while she has company.<br> Knock it off...<br> Where's his father?<br> Gone.<br> Well, I guess into each life<br> a little rain must fall.<br> There are a lot tougher ways<br> of making a living than going to war.<br> You know about babies.<br> Yeah, I know about babies.<br> So long, Mac.<br> - Wait!<br> - I can't spend it on a coral reef.<br> - You're a very good man.<br> - You'll get odds on that in the Marines.<br> So long.<br> So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.<br> Let's not get religion.<br> - I'll pray for you, Sergeant!<br> - Good luck.<br> You got a lot of bloodhound in you,<br> Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.<br> I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.<br> Catch me feeling sorry for myself again<br> and you got my permission<br> to belt me in the nose!<br> - Buy you a drink?<br> - Lock and load, boy!<br> - Thanks!<br> - Two bourbon and ice.<br> - A baby's a big event.<br> - Conway!<br> - Treating the boys?<br> - Crack open the hatch!<br> That's great. A fellow always gets<br> more kick out of a boy, I guess.<br> I got a kid. Sam, I named him...<br> ...after your old man.<br> Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't<br> write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.<br> No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't<br> have to write. I'll be where he is.<br> And I won't insist that he be tough.<br> I'll try to make him intelligent.<br> And I won't insist that he read the Marine<br> Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.<br> I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway<br> or Sergeant Stryker.<br> I want him to be intelligent, considerate,<br> cultured and a gentleman.<br> - You're out of line, kid.<br> - Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.<br> Thanks, and I intend<br> to exercise that right.<br> - I don't like you, Stryker.<br> - Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.<br> I can't have friction in the squad.<br> I've tried every approach to you that I<br> know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...<br> Don't patronise me. Your opinion of<br> my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.<br> Let's get this straight.<br> On duty I jump when you holler.<br> Off duty I exercise my God-given rights<br> under a democracy<br> and dislike whom I please.<br> Do we understand each other?<br> - Beat it.<br> - Come on, you guys, let's go.<br> I don't understand<br> why you don't belt him.<br> - Mellow in my old age, I guess.<br> - Too bad.<br> "Screaming Sam"<br> couldn't be proud of him.<br> He could. There's something inside<br> a guy, always proud of a kid.<br> - Two more?<br> - Not for me.<br> - I'll sail again. One.<br> - OK.<br> - Maybe you can steer me home?<br> - Charge!<br> Pull pins!<br> Prepare to throw!<br> Throw!<br> - All right, fifth relay!<br> - What an arm!<br> Pick it up!<br> Right in the groove!<br> - Look, boy, this is a live grenade.<br> - Gee!<br> - You know what they can do?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Right hand. Wait for the order<br> to pull pin and pitch grenade.<br> - Got it?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Ready?<br> Pull pin!<br> Prepare to throw!<br> Throw!<br> Grenade! Hit the deck!<br> When will you wake up? You wanna see<br> her again, keep your mind on your work!<br> - What happened here?<br> - Little accident, sir.<br> You're wounded. Corpsman!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Take care of the sergeant.<br> Come right over here, Sergeant.<br> You may not know it,<br> but you just got your life saved.<br> You'll get a medal.<br> Again the word came<br> and the Marines moved out.<br> Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred<br> destinations, all wrong.<br> This time we were a sound fighting unit,<br> blooded and trained.<br> Tarawa had blooded us.<br> Stryker had trained us.<br> - Now, I'll show you something.<br> - What you got there?<br> - What does it look like?<br> - A flag.<br> - What are you gonna do with it?<br> - Occupy this island in the USA's name.<br> - You think we'll have an easy time?<br> - You got me with you.<br> - Maybe we need two of you.<br> - One was enough in Tarawa.<br> Stick with me.<br> I'm a battle-hardened veteran.<br> Know how many Japs I knocked off<br> in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?<br> I got enemies in Washington.<br> If the Marines didn't have me,<br> they'd never have made it.<br> Now, this is how you fold a flag!<br> Do you believe in intuition?<br> Yeah... in women. Why?<br> It's hard to explain. I've a feeling<br> I'm not coming out of this operation.<br> Don't talk that way.<br> - I can't help it. It's the way I feel.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.<br> I can't shake the feeling off.<br> Take my advice, shake it off.<br> No dice. When things like that get in you,<br> it's no use trying to fight them.<br> If a marine waits long enough<br> he gets the word.<br> Our sealed orders came aboard<br> after five days at sea.<br> This island is volcanic and sandy.<br> It's five and a half miles long<br> and two and a half miles wide.<br> This mountain here<br> is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.<br> There's nothing on the island except<br> three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.<br> The Army Air Corps B-24s have been<br> bombing this place for 62 days.<br> - Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.<br> - We can't be sure.<br> Every yard is covered<br> by some kind of fire.<br> There are two possible landing beaches,<br> one on the east side, one on the west.<br> The rest of the coastline is cliffs.<br> They'll try and keep us off the beaches.<br> If they don't, they'll try and catch us<br> at this first airfield,<br> between the heights of Suribachi<br> and these high rocky ridges in the north.<br> They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody<br> knows what they've got on this island.<br> But they've had 40 years to put it there.<br> Saipan was our last stop.<br> The men who were going to hit<br> the beach first transferred to LS Ts.<br> A few more days at sea<br> and the time for landing came.<br> Saddle up!<br> Skip along and into the amtracs.<br> Anyway, it's a good day for it.<br> - It's cold.<br> - Stick around, it'll get warm.<br> Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<br> Hey, look!<br> - Driver, you the joker that wrote that?<br> - "Semper fi", Mac!<br> We should take you in along with us.<br> Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket<br> full of books! Five books he's got!<br> So? The kid's a reader.<br> That shouldn't worry a dope like you.<br> When we're through with this operation,<br> I'm gonna break both your legs!<br> - I feel sick.<br> - I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.<br> Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".<br> Aleychem shalom.<br> - Sarge, I'm scared.<br> - So am I.<br> - Not you!<br> - Fowler, I'm always scared.<br> Line of departure! Get down!<br> Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts<br> when we hit the beach!<br> All right, hit the beach!<br> It ain't Brooklyn!<br> If this place was a blanket<br> I'd pull it over my head!<br> This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What<br> does anyone want an island like this for?<br> - That's war.<br> - What's war?<br> Trading real estate for men.<br> When God made the world, he must<br> have put all the rubbish left over here.<br> Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.<br> Doggone it, almost the same place<br> they got me before!<br> Getting shot for this!<br> They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.<br> Not enough. Those Nips<br> are shooting right down our throats.<br> - Stryker!<br> - Yo!<br> - Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.<br> - Lieutenant Shrier?<br> Stand fast.<br> - Stryker reporting, sir.<br> - I know.<br> Your platoon's been hit hard.<br> What's left has been assigned to me.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.<br> Aye, aye.<br> Move out!<br> Keep your distance!<br> - Go on, go on!<br> - Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!<br> Spread out! Dig in!<br> - Dunne, where's my brother?<br> - Back there. He's hit.<br> Flynn!<br> That's enough!<br> I told you you'd need this bad<br> some day. Thanks, Marine.<br> Flynn! Get down!<br> - You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!<br> - You can still be a hero crawling!<br> - Corpsman!<br> - Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!<br> Harris!<br> Well, I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.<br> Corpsman!<br> He won't need him.<br> - Pillbox too big to handle with these.<br> - A bazooka?<br> - If we had one.<br> - I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.<br> Regazzi didn't make it.<br> You never know what's happening.<br> Listen.<br> - It's a tank.<br> - Yeah, but whose?<br> Ours!<br> It's Regazzi.<br> Pillbox at 2 o'clock.<br> OK, give 'em a hot foot!<br> Thanks, Mac.<br> - I couldn't find a bazooka.<br> - You did all right. Saddle up!<br> No one had ever seen anything like it.<br> No one would have believed it possible.<br> That smoking, miserable, bloody island.<br> After three days and three nights,<br> and at the end of that time,<br> we'd barely reached the foot of<br> Suribachi, where we were the first day.<br> - We'll sack here for the night.<br> - Best news today.<br> Pair off and one man awake at all times.<br> Keep alert. Let's go.<br> It'll start getting rough tomorrow<br> against Suribachi.<br> It started getting rough<br> when you put on that uniform.<br> You wanna see a good-looking kid?<br> Husky little boot. What's his name?<br> We're gonna name him Sam,<br> Sam Conway.<br> A name that's been awarded the Navy<br> Cross is good enough for any kid.<br> There's something I've been trying<br> to say but... I can't find the words.<br> Two universities and you can't find<br> the words to say you were out of line?<br> - OK, I'm out of line.<br> - No, you were. There's a difference.<br> We'd better get some sack time.<br> Wanna sleep first or watch?<br> - I'll watch.<br> - OK.<br> Everybody gets out of line<br> once in a while.<br> Thanks, gyrene.<br> Where's Sergeant Stryker?<br> - Stryker?<br> - Right there.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.<br> - Stryker, sir.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.<br> Get your men squared away<br> and be ready at 0700.<br> - The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.<br> - Aye, aye, sir, 0700.<br> That little voice whispering<br> in your ear again?<br> Don't worry. I've known<br> a million guys that have heard it.<br> Most of them make it. A few don't.<br> The percentage is on your side.<br> - Did you ever hear it?<br> - No.<br> - Don't you ever worry about it?<br> - What good would it do?<br> - You're indestructible.<br> - Stick close. It might rub off!<br> I'll do that.<br> Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is<br> ready to move. Request supporting fire.<br> Ow!<br> Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...<br> Adonai echad.<br> Amen.<br> Radio!<br> Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.<br> This is Easy Five. Cease fire,<br> we're preparing to move over the top.<br> - Roger and out. Stryker!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag<br> when the top's secure. Get it there.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> What is this?<br> Put yours away.<br> This is the one we're gonna use.<br> First squad. Find something we can use<br> as a standard and we'll put this up.<br> - Conway, you made it.<br> - I guess that little voice was wrong.<br> - I feel better.<br> - I feel better, too.<br> I never felt so good in my life.<br> How about a cigarette?<br> - Is he...?<br> - Yeah.<br> If he had to get it<br> it's the way he'd have wanted.<br> It's a letter to his kid.<br> "Dear son, I guess none of my letters<br> have reached you.<br> "I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling<br> "that this may be the last<br> time I can write you.<br> "For a long time<br> I've wanted to tell you many things.<br> "Now that you're a big boy, I will.<br> "If we'd been together even for a while,<br> "I could've explained many things<br> much better than writing them.<br> "You've gotta take care of your mother,<br> and love her and make her happy.<br> "Never hurt her or anyone as I did.<br> "Always do what your heart<br> tells you is right.<br> "Maybe someone will write you some day<br> and tell you about me.<br> "I want you to be like me in some<br> things, but not like me in others.<br> "When you grow older and get to know<br> more about me, you'll see I've failed...<br> "... in many ways.<br> "This isn't what I wanted<br> but things just turned out that way.<br> "If there was only more time I... "<br> Guess he never finished it.<br> I'll finish it for him.<br> There she goes.<br> All right, saddle up!<br> Let's get back in the war!<br>
