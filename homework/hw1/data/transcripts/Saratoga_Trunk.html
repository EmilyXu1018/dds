Look here-<br> poker games! Poker games when<br> there are fools with millions!<br> Do you think i came here<br> to pick up dollar bits<br> like those girls<br> in your cheap dance<br> halls in the west, do you?<br> Right careless way<br> to handle money.<br> Of course, for somebody<br> that's going to<br> have it to burn-<br> yes, and when i have, it's going<br> to be my own. Mine-clio dulaine's.<br> Well, good luck.<br> When you think about us-<br> texas, paris-<br> it's downright comical.<br> Trying to sneak away<br> with me, huh?<br> We leave<br> these women, yeah?<br> I heard her tell you<br> what to do,<br> now you go and do it.<br> You go back there and take good<br> care of her, or i'll skin you alive.<br> Come in, monsieur.<br> Monsieur.<br> Mademoiselle.<br> From your letter asking<br> me to call at your office-<br> which you chose to ignore, mademoiselle.<br> Madame, or comtesse, if you prefer.<br> I'd hoped we were<br> going to be honest<br> and straightforward.<br> Oh, but of course.<br> Good.

Du chenfrais.<br> I'm bart van steed.<br> It's no trouble at all.<br> Bartholomew van steed.<br> How enchanting!<br> It's like being met<br> unexpectedly<br> by a friend<br> in a strange land.<br> It is a strange land<br> to me,<br> but perhaps you're<br> meeting someone else.<br> I was expecting<br> my mother.<br> She telegraphed that she<br> was arriving on this train.<br> And she didn't come?<br> Perhaps she missed the<br> train or changed her mind.<br> My mother never<br> misses a train.<br> And she never<br> changes her mind.<br> Perhaps someone<br> was playing a joke.<br> People do not<br> play jokes on me.<br> It was lucky that<br> i brought the phaeton.<br> Mother won't ride<br> in the dogcart.<br> But i'm afraid there<br> isn't room for all of you.<br> Mais certainement,<br> it will do beautifully.<br> My woman can sit back<br> there with your groom-<br> she's very thin-<br> and cupidon can stand here on the step.<br> Now, my bag right there at my feet.<br> Oh, but i<br> assure you-<br> oh, i don't mind. The hotel<br> porter will see to my trunks.<br> Angelique, you have<br> my jewel case? Good.<br> Cupidon, right here<br> on the step.<br> Oh, this is wonderful.<br> So very kind.<br> I don't know what<br> i should have done<br> if you hadn't appeared<br> like a shining knight.<br> Do people always stare<br> like this in america?<br> Well, when they have<br> someone like you to stare at.<br> I gather this is your<br> first visit to saratoga,<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> C'est vrai?<br> I speak some french.<br> Oh, no, no!<br> That is, i read french<br> much better than i speak it.<br> Hey, you!<br> Your best suite of rooms<br> for madame la comtesse!<br> Did you say...<br> mr. Roscoe bean-<br> our head usher.<br> Your ladyship.<br> If you please, i wish to live in america<br> quietly and<br> democratically<br> simply as<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> Your magnificent hotel<br> is exactly as<br> i knew it would be.<br> But your ladyship<br> - madame has been here before?<br> No. But my husband<br> le comte-the late comte.<br> Comte<br> du chenfrais.<br> I don't seem to recall. Was it recently?<br> Please, i rather we didn't<br> speak of him anymore.<br> I'm not yet fully recovered<br> from my bereavement.<br> If i may be allowed<br> to live here quietly.<br> Of course, of course. Incognito.<br> How well i remember when his<br> excellency, the marquis de-<br> i assure you<br> mrs. Du chenfrais<br> is not interested in his excellency,<br> but in her accommodations.<br> Of course, of course, accommodations.<br> Accommodations-<br> dear me.<br> But we have no<br> accommodations.<br> If madame had only<br> let us know in advance.<br> Perhaps one of<br> the other hotels?<br> Mrs. Du chenfrais,<br> no!<br> Tomorrow i can<br> let you have a suite<br> in one of the cottages in the rear.<br> I? At the rear?<br> That's preposterous!<br> You must accommodate<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> Why, i, myself,<br> will give up my-<br> excuse me, ma'am...<br> but i couldn't help overhearing<br> what you were saying.<br> My name's maroon.<br> Clint maroon.<br> Really,<br> gentlemen, i...<br> no offense, ma'am.<br> Look here, you can't address<br> a lady you've never met.<br> Introduce us, then,<br> and make it legal.<br> I'm aiming to help<br> the little lady.<br> Mrs. Du chenfrais, may<br> i present colonel maroon?<br> Right glad to meet you,<br> ma'am.<br> I'm occupying three rooms<br> just to stretch my legs,<br> and you might as well<br> have a couple of them.<br> No, i wouldn't think of<br> turning you out of your rooms.<br> There's no sense of me<br> using all that space.<br> I'll go and get my things out,<br> and you can move in right now.<br> How good of you,<br> colonel, uh...<br> maroon. Clint maroon.<br> What a delightful name!<br> So american.<br> Texas, ma'am.<br> Texas? I should<br> love to see texas.<br> Play your cards right,<br> ma'am, and maybe you can.<br> Well, i'll mosey along<br> and be out in two shakes.<br> Oh, how can<br> i thank you?<br> I feel that we are<br> actually friends.<br> I'm happy to have<br> been of service.<br> I hope that your<br> dear mother's telegram<br> will soon be followed by her<br> company. Good-bye, mr. Van steed.<br> Oh, i'll see you<br> again soon,<br> since we're living<br> under the same roof.<br> Who is this gentleman,<br> your friend in the white hat?<br> He's the real figure<br> of an american. Who is he?<br> Maroon? Texas cattleman, i'm told.<br> Some such thing. But<br> he's no friend of mine.<br> Oh, a pity. In paris, he<br> would have been the rage.<br> Your mother didn't come,<br> bartholomew. What a disappointment.<br> Mrs. Bellop.<br> You're not playing a little<br> joke on us, are you, bart?<br> You didn't drive down to the depot<br> just to meet a certain somebody else?<br> I'm not obliged to<br> explain my behavior<br> to a lot of harpies<br> on a hotel piazza.<br> She's really lovely.<br> I tell you, i don't<br> even know the lady.<br> You must introduce me sometime.<br> I should love to meet her.<br> Raise those shades.<br> Mind that luggage.<br> I'll have a housekeeper<br> and chamber maids<br> up here immediately.<br> Nothing now,<br> thank you.<br> No maids.<br> I must rest.<br> Cupid, run down to see<br> if the trunks have come.<br> Well, it looks like this is<br> about all of my stuff, ma'am.<br> It's so kind of you,<br> mr. - Colonel maroon.<br> I feel quite guilty.<br> No call to at all.<br> Good day, ma'am.<br> Well, it looks like<br> we're going to be neighbors.<br> I'll lock the door on your<br> side, mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> Now, if you'll kindly lock it<br> on your side, colonel maroon.<br> It's a double lock,<br> you see. Both sides.<br> If there's anything<br> i can do for you-<br> if there's anything at all, mr.<br> Bean, i'll send for you at once.<br> Thank you so much. Now,<br> you will let me know if-<br> how are you, ma'am?<br> If you'd called me "ma'am"<br> down there once more,<br> i'd have screamed.<br> I sure would have admired<br> to hear you, ma'am,<br> only i'd have hated to<br> have you scare bart away.<br> How in sam hill you get<br> him eating out of your hand?<br> I'd discovered that mrs. Van<br> steed was safely in bar harbor<br> having a grandchild,<br> so i sent him a telegram<br> to meet me at the station.<br> And he came?<br> I signed it "mama."<br> Huh.<br> When i saw him sashaying<br> in acting like he owned you-<br> are you jealous-<br> you're durn tooting,<br> i'm jealous.<br> Just have to get<br> used to it, my darling.<br> We mustn't forget<br> why i'm here.<br> Send her away.<br> It was<br> a long train trip.<br> My poor child.<br> I didn't sleep not one<br> hour on that dreadful train.<br> Thinking up that<br> flashy entrance?<br> Ha ha! Clever,<br> wasn't it?<br> What did you come here for, anyway?<br> I was getting along<br> fine.<br> Did they get wise to you and<br> kick you out of new orleans?<br> You know very well why i came<br> here. Have i ever pretended?<br> No, but ain't you ever<br> gonna be satisfied?<br> Satisfied with what?<br> Some good jewelry?<br> Mama's made-over clothes?<br> Money enough to last me over<br> the summer if i'm careful?<br> I want respectability<br> and comfort and security!<br> We cannot get used<br> to each other, cheri.<br> Not too much. That would<br> be bad, n'est-ce pas?<br> Oh, very bad.<br> Ness pop.<br> It's no use arguing<br> with her, mr. Clint.<br> She's very tired.<br> She ought to go to sleep.<br> Oh, there are hundreds of things<br> i must know before i sleep.<br> Stop scowling like a cross<br> little boy and talk to me!<br> Peaches!<br> Peaches! Hey, you!<br> Peaches!<br> Hey, clio! Hold it!<br> You can't do that!<br> You can't do that!<br> Come here!<br> I want a peach!<br> I'm hungry!<br> Stop screaming<br> into the streets!<br> Here's cupidon!<br> He can go!<br> Quick, cupidon,<br> before the man is gone!<br> Hey, you little<br> soldier!<br> Bring me<br> some champagne.<br> Fresh peaches bobbing<br> in a glass of champagne!<br> That's the way mama<br> used to drink it in paris!<br> Peaches! Peaches!<br> Mrs. Bellop, i looked<br> it up in burke's peerage.<br> There's no<br> du chenfrais.<br> Of course there isn't.<br> Burke's peerage is english,<br> and she's french.<br> Oh, good morning,<br> little man.<br> How long have you been with the<br> countess, and where did you come from?<br> Oh, so i'm<br> a fat old sow, am i?<br> Merci bien!<br> That's the way<br> i love it. Mmm.<br> Cozy and everyone near me...<br> and things stirring.<br> Take a little sip, cheri.<br> Just a little sip.<br> It's heavenly.<br> Peaches in champagne?<br> That's no drink for a man.<br> Don't be like that.<br> Tell me everything.<br> Tell me about these men...<br> these rich, respectable old men<br> who sit and rock<br> on that huge piazza.<br> If it's bart van steed<br> you have on your mind,<br> he's gonna be too busy<br> to bother about you, honey.<br> I heard yesterday<br> they're out to get him.<br> Why? How? When?<br> Van steed owns a railroad<br> between albany and binghamton,<br> right up here near saratoga.<br> It's what they call a trunk<br> line, only about 100 miles long.<br> Years ago, his mama gave<br> it to him to play with-<br> his first little railroad.<br> Now it's turned up<br> worth millions.<br> Why millions?<br> Angelique, stop rattling that paper!<br> Why is this saratoga<br> trunk worth millions?<br> How can i sleep when there are<br> things like this i must know?<br> Tell me-why millions?<br> Well, it seems<br> it's the link<br> between the new pennsylvania<br> hard coal lands and new england.<br> Sure thing,<br> it's worth millions.<br> Does he know this?<br> Van steed?<br> Listen, he ain't<br> as loco as he looks.<br> Don't raise your eyebrows<br> when i say "ain't."<br> Raymond soule's crowd<br> have been going at it<br> with every dirty trick<br> there is in the book.<br> Graft. Politics. Force.<br> For what they're doing,<br> they'd be strung up for outlaws<br> out west. You wouldn't believe it.<br> They hire gangs to go out and tear<br> up tracks and chop down trestles.<br> Folks won't ride the railroad<br> anymore. It ain't safe.<br> That's just what this<br> soule's figuring on-<br> running it right down to nothing.<br> Buy it up cheap<br> - hair, hide, horns, and tallow.<br> Who is he?<br> He's boss of the upstate railroad crowd.<br> Likely, you were too busy making goo-goo<br> eyes when you come in to notice him.<br> Always sitting<br> there on the piazza<br> hiding behind<br> a couple of bodyguards.<br> Don't let his size fool you.<br> He's big poison.<br> Is he rich?<br> Rub my foot, cheri.<br> Huh.<br> Couple of hundred million.<br> Maybe more.<br> Is he married?<br> No, honey. No.<br> I mean, no for you.<br> Well, one never knows.<br> Now, go on, cheri.<br> I'm fascinated.<br> Mmm, that feels good.<br> There's more to this soule bunch.<br> They're hooked up with those<br> skunks that came through texas.<br> Oww!<br> You're hurting me!<br> Sorry, honey.<br> I was thinking.<br> My fingers just itch<br> to get ahold of a gun<br> when i think of that pack of<br> varmints out there rocking.<br> I bet i could pick one or two<br> of them off from your window.<br> Poor little<br> bartholomew van steed.<br> Poor little mama's boy.<br> No one to help him.<br> Don't worry about<br> little bartholomew.<br> He's got a good team, too-<br> for one, the richest<br> banker in new york,<br> the fellow that's got that<br> place down on wall street-<br> the house of<br> something or other-<br> and that scotchman who owns all<br> those steel mills and coal mines,<br> and plenty of others.<br> Railroads! Railroads!<br> Railroads!<br> What do i care<br> about railroads?<br> What am i doing here?<br> Who are you?<br> How do i know who you are?<br> Holy cats!

Maroon?<br> Ain't seen<br> nor heard of him.<br> Good. Where's cupidon? In here?<br> Poor little man.<br> Howdy, ma'am.<br> Good morning, cupidon.<br> Why didn't you sleep downstairs<br> in the room provided for you?<br> He said stay near you and the old crow.<br> Ah, to watch me,<br> no doubt.<br> Tell me,<br> what have you found out?<br> Who are<br> the important people?<br> Well, there's<br> that fat woman.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Who is the fat woman?<br> Bellop.<br> Don't make<br> ugly noises.<br> That's her name-<br> bellop.<br> They say everybody in<br> saratoga's afraid of her.<br> Yes?<br> She tried to<br> question me about you.<br> I pretended to<br> speak only french.<br> And what<br> do you think?<br> She speaks french<br> like anything!<br> So...<br> well, out of here,<br> both of you.<br> Make yourself<br> neat and smart.<br> You, cupidon, look to<br> your shoes and buttons.<br> Be polite to the hotel<br> servants. No tricks!<br> And you, angelique,<br> no voodoo, no witchwork.<br> Your best black silk!<br> We're going to the springs.<br> About time.<br> Two days lost.<br> Red heels<br> ain't for widows.<br> It's the way<br> i feel today.<br> My husband has been dead as a<br> herring for at least two years.<br> You full of<br> the devil.<br> Your ladyship,<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> How have you been,<br> mr. Bean?<br> Frantic.<br> Simply frantic.<br> Two days! There have<br> been dozens of inquiries.<br> How kind of people<br> to take such interest.<br> We pictured you<br> desolated with your grief.<br> I think i'll take<br> the waters this morning.<br> I hear your famous springs<br> are most healthful.<br> Perhaps you could<br> recommend one.<br> Of course. We have a<br> specially prepared booklet.<br> I told you these two days<br> haven't been wasted.<br> Regardez.<br> By the front door.<br> That's the one been asking<br> questions about you.<br> For example, there's<br> the triton water-<br> gout, irritated stomachs,<br> pimples blotches, ulcers.<br> Please, mr. Bean!<br> The empire spring is<br> very gay. The band plays-<br> good morning.<br> Mrs. Du chenfrais,<br> i'm mrs. Coventry bellop.<br> I want to welcome you<br> to saratoga...<br> and to tell you<br> that i had the great<br> pleasure of knowing<br> your late lamented husband-<br> dear, dear bimby.<br> Is it possible?<br> Well, isn't it?<br> Hardly. He was<br> almost a recluse.<br> Perhaps you're thinking<br> of his younger brother-<br> the black sheep,<br> i'm afraid.<br> He was known as bimby among his friends.<br> I shouldn't wonder,<br> if you say so.<br> I told you you were wrong to<br> be suspicious of this lady.<br> Me? My dear<br> mrs. Bellop!<br> Oh, isn't that-<br> but of course it must be-<br> mr. Raymond soule,<br> the railroad man.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> I'll speak to him.<br> Nobody ever speaks<br> to mr. Soule<br> unless mr. Soule<br> speaks to them first.<br> Good morning, mr. Soule,<br> so pleasant to see you!<br> My husband<br> spoke of you.<br> I am mrs.<br> Du chenfrais.<br> I do not know<br> the name.<br> You'll recall him as<br> le comte du chenfrais.<br> Please<br> don't stand up.<br> Perhaps it<br> was this colonel...<br> white hat maroon i<br> heard speak of you.<br> I don't know him, either.<br> The texan-the one who's<br> says he's going to ruin you?<br> Good day, mr. Soule.<br> Such a lovely chat.<br> Now i'm walking to<br> this delightful empire spring.<br> Walking! But everybody<br> rides to take the waters.<br> But i am here<br> for my health.<br> What a woman!<br> She makes<br> her entrance here<br> on the arm of our<br> most eligible bachelor.<br> She disappears for two<br> days while we wonder.<br> When she reappears, her first<br> act is to be seen talking<br> to the almighty<br> mr. Soule.<br> But she walks<br> to the springs.<br> What will people<br> say? It's heresy.<br> Don't be any sillier<br> than you are, dear beanie.<br> It's sheer genius...<br> if she can get<br> away with it.<br> Another cup,<br> angelique.<br> I can feel it<br> doing me good.<br> Good morning,<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> You've been ill?<br> You didn't come down...<br> not ill. Weary.<br> I can<br> understand that.<br> But you look-<br> you seem to be<br> fully recovered,<br> that is, if appearances are anything.<br> Thank you.<br> You must have driven<br> down very early.<br> I didn't drive.<br> I walked.<br> Walked? Then you must<br> allow me to drive you back.<br> No, no.<br> I'm walking back.<br> I intend to walk down and<br> back every morning early-<br> that's one of<br> the european cures.<br> Splendid idea. You must<br> allow me to walk with you.<br> If you care to.<br> Good day.<br> May i stroll<br> with you?<br> Of course.<br> There's that<br> fascinating mr. Maroon.<br> You presented him,<br> remember?<br> And he will ask to<br> drive me back, too.<br> You're all so kind.<br> He's the reason i've been<br> so weary until now.<br> All that first night,<br> he kept me awake.<br> If he's been<br> annoying you-<br> no, not him, exactly.<br> It was talk, talk,<br> talk in the next room.<br> Railroads, railroads-<br> i thought i should go mad.<br> I'm thinking of moving to a<br> cottage apartment this morning,<br> for quiet.<br> They weren't talking<br> railroads, were they?<br> What could they say<br> about railroads<br> that would keep<br> a charming woman awake?<br> I don't know. Such things<br> are too much for me.<br> Oh, albany<br> and trunk lines.<br> Tell me, what is<br> the saratoga trunk?<br> I thought it was<br> something for clothes.<br> Trunks and railroads kept whirling<br> around in my head. Maddening, it was.<br> Have i said something?<br> You look troubled.<br> Good morning,<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> Colonel maroon.<br> If you're going back<br> to the hotel-<br> what is this i hear about<br> you talking railroads so loud<br> that this lady has to move<br> out of her rooms?<br> You've been circulating<br> this morning.<br> On my way out of the hotel<br> just now, i met mr. Soule.<br> He wanted to know what this<br> was about my threatening to-<br> soule? Are you<br> hooked up with him?<br> I hope i haven't said<br> anything i shouldn't.<br> Just to know you've had my name<br> on your lips gives me pleasure.<br> You shouldn't be angry<br> with colonel maroon.<br> He's on your side.<br> I distinctly heard his<br> voice say that he thought<br> you were more clever<br> than any of them.<br> By that time,<br> they were shouting.<br> When i was talking to mr. Soule<br> this morning on the piazza,<br> i thought his voice sounded like<br> the one who was disputing mr. Maroon.<br> Mr. Maroon was telling him<br> he had some kind of a plan<br> that was going to win<br> this railroad war.<br> He was going to offer it<br> to you and ruin mr. Soule...<br> or was it the other way<br> around?<br> Oh, oh, dear me...<br> i hope you aren't<br> angry with me.<br> Oh, dear mr. Van steed,<br> oh, dear colonel maroon,<br> i detest<br> strong-minded women<br> who interfere<br> in men's affairs.<br> I understand, ma'am.<br> Colonel, possibly you could<br> run my railroad better than l-<br> now, gentlemen, this is no<br> place to discuss business.<br> Have you forgotten you've asked<br> me to have breakfast with you?<br> Well, that's<br> hardly possible.<br> I'm having breakfast<br> over at the track<br> with the grooms<br> and the jockeys.<br> Oh, what<br> a delightful surprise!<br> Ladies can't eat<br> in stables.<br> Well, this one can.<br> Miss clio! You're<br> not going without me,<br> miss clio!<br> Let him come.<br> I do want<br> to thank you<br> for the lovely<br> pink roses you sent.<br> I am glad<br> you liked them...<br> and don't forget,<br> mrs. Du chenfrais-<br> you're dining with me<br> tonight.<br> Delighted.<br> Cheri,<br> you're not angry.<br> Take your hand off my arm! What<br> do you think i'm driving? Cattle?<br> How can you talk to me like that?<br> No one has ever talked to me-<br> it's time they did, then.<br> Clint, i have such a clever<br> idea. I'm only trying to help you.<br> I'll try to explain this<br> slow and easy<br> without losing my temper.<br> Really, you should be proud of me.<br> I'm only thinking of your future.<br> Interrupt again, and i'll<br> smash in your pretty nose.<br> I've got some plans<br> of my own.<br> Oh, clint, have you?<br> What are they?<br> And i don't need you<br> to come busting in.<br> Let's see... i'm only a woman.<br> I don't have a right to think.<br> I've got every respect<br> for womankind,<br> but in texas, it's the men<br> who wear the pants.<br> I was up here<br> wearing mine.<br> Now you come along, starting<br> trouble, acting downright loco.<br> What have i done?<br> I only just arrived.<br> And then what? Screeching<br> out of hotel windows,<br> peaches and champagne<br> in the middle of the day,<br> pulling<br> the sleeping beauty act,<br> sashaying out telling the<br> doggonedest mess of lies.<br> You planning<br> to keep this up?<br> Yes.

Du chenfrais?<br> That depends, mr. Van steed,<br> upon so many, many things.<br> On what, for instance?<br> Things you'd consider<br> quite sordid, i'm afraid.<br> Sordid?<br> Everything is so<br> expensive over here.<br> It takes so many francs to<br> make one american dollar.<br> You should never have to<br> worry about such things.<br> You're so-<br> you should have everything<br> that's beautl-<br> well, beautiful.<br> You're so kind.<br> You smoke cigarettes,<br> mrs.

Where<br> i come from,<br> possession is<br> nine points of that.<br> They've got<br> the legislature,<br> and they've<br> manipulated the stock.<br> Even down in texas,<br> we know that watering stock<br> don't only mean<br> just giving the cows a drink.<br> But you're right.<br> All that stuff-<br> dirty politics-<br> that ain't up my alley...<br> but fighting is.<br> I've never seen one yet<br> that wasn't won by<br> being quicker on the draw.<br> I'd fight them<br> barehanded-<br> same old plan<br> we used out west<br> when the sheepmen tried to run<br> the cattlemen off the range.<br> Soule's crowd<br> is wrecking your railroad.<br> You've got to keep it running<br> or lose your franchise.<br> I'd battle them bloody.<br> I'd run them off the range.<br> Lordy, lordy,<br> i think maybe you would.<br> Where have you been<br> hiding this man?<br> I'd get me a bunch of boys<br> together, the real hard-muscled kind.<br> There's a lot of them<br> down where i come from<br> that don't like railroads any<br> more than they do rattlers.<br> Worse.<br> It's the wild east.<br> We hang men down there<br> for less crimes<br> than you boys do to<br> each other just in fun.<br> What can we lose that<br> we aren't losing now?<br> Maybe we'd better let this<br> minority stockholder in<br> just to take care of us.<br> All right, it will cost<br> you all a fistful of stock.<br> A big fistful.<br> It's worth it, colonel,<br> if you can do this.<br> I'll do it.<br> I'll go the whole hog<br> to put my brand<br> on that crowd that<br> came through texas.<br> I've got a little score<br> of my own to settle.<br> Win this, and you won't have to<br> stop with any fistful of stock.<br> I'll take you along with<br> me, right up the line.<br> I ought to warn you... likely,<br> i'll have the whole railroad<br> before i'm through.<br> Colonel, i think<br> you're my boy.<br> Just hang a welcome sign on the front<br> door of that house of yours on wall street.<br> You've just acquired<br> yourself a partner.<br> Morning,<br> colonel.<br> Hey, what's up?<br> The cats seem to be meowing<br> louder than ordinary this morning.<br> Colonel maroon, you kill<br> me the way you put things.<br> It's madame van steed.<br> Madame van steed<br> has arrived.<br> You don't say.<br> Battle 'em bloody!<br> Run them up the range!<br> Son of a gun!<br> Ha ha ha!<br> I listen to<br> all the poker games.<br> I'm just keyhole-sized.<br> Quit talking!<br> Wranglers and poker games-who<br> cares about all that?<br> Where's mr. Clint<br> all the time?<br> Where have you been?<br> You ain't touched<br> your lunch, honey.<br> Mr. Clint.<br> Saw the bellboy<br> stagger<br> and thought i'd help him with his load.<br> Bartholomew's<br> splurging.<br> Flowers. That's<br> a northerner for you.<br> Why ain't he sent you<br> jewelry?<br> To take jewelry<br> from a man<br> that's not your husband,<br> that isn't nice.<br> My ma never had any<br> husband any more than you,<br> but she got jewelry-<br> diamonds and ruby rings<br> and large stone necklaces.<br> I'll give you<br> my diamond stickpin<br> if you want it, honey.<br> How are you making out<br> with little bart?<br> Wonderfully.<br> That's fine, countess.<br> I reckon i just wasn't<br> worth frettin' about<br> that day<br> at the french market.<br> Where have you been,<br> clint? Why don't i see you?<br> Business-<br> playing railroad,<br> gettinne,<br> too.<br> You know, i'd like to<br> take you around, honey,<br> but i had a little<br> matter to attend to.<br> Now, bart, he'd come a<br> - running if he knew you wanted to go out.<br> Why don't you send<br> cupidon over with a note?<br> How dare you!<br> What's up? Have i said something-<br> how dare you say to me<br> that you're busy<br> and suggest that i go around asking<br> other men to take me here and there?<br> Hold on. I didn't say<br> anything about other men.<br> I said bart. He's the man<br> you're fixing to marry.<br> Oh. So that's it.<br> You're jealous.<br> Yeah. Leastways, i<br> would be if i had time,<br> but i'm busy<br> as a sheepdog.<br> It's too bad your plan<br> isn't working out so well.<br> Whose plan isn't?<br> In a game like yours,<br> you got to work quick<br> and get out before<br> they find the pea<br> under<br> the walnut shell.<br> Yeah. It's too bad<br> you're too late.<br> Too late?<br> I sure hate<br> to tell you.<br> It seems<br> downright cruel.<br> Bart's mama's come.<br> Mama van steed.<br> Yes, ma'am,<br> countess.<br> The queen of saratoga, the head cat.<br> The lioness has come<br> to defend her cub.<br> When?<br> She descended this<br> morning, they tell me,<br> with her claws showing<br> and her fangs bared.<br> The other tabbies are paying court<br> to her on the piazza right now.<br> I wonder how your pretty<br> skin's gonna look in ribbons?<br> Angelique,<br> get my things.<br> Cupidon,<br> get the carriage<br> and take miss clio<br> for a drive.<br> I think she'll need<br> some fresh air.<br> You betcha.<br> Mrs. Du chenfrais<br> is coming now, mother.<br> De trigononai du chenfrais<br> de fiddlesticks.<br> She's an adventuress.<br> It's written all over her.<br> Good morning,<br> countess.<br> Colonel maroon.<br> Fetch her.<br> Oh, mrs.

Du chenfrais.<br> Very clever.<br> Won't you<br> sit down?<br> You say you've been here<br> before, they tell me.<br> No. My dear husband<br> was here once.<br> Dear edouard-<br> the late comte.<br> That ninny roscoe bean<br> couldn't find<br> your husband's signature<br> in the hotel register.<br> Isn't that odd?<br> His signature?<br> I've been coming to the<br> saratoga hotel for years.<br> I've met every<br> well-known person<br> that ever stopped here-<br> in my day, that is.<br> And i've searched the<br> registers, old and new...<br> but no<br> comte du chenfrais.<br> Are you sure<br> he stayed here?<br> Eh?<br> Incognito.<br> When a french diplomat is in<br> america on affairs of state,<br> it's sometimes wise<br> to discard titles.<br> Well, i'm quite sure<br> mother doesn't mean-<br> i'm quite sure that<br> mother does mean.<br> She doesn't mean a thing,<br> do you, clarissa?<br> I always did tell<br> dear etienne<br> that his passion for shunning<br> the limelight was silly.<br> Etienne?<br> And who is etienne?<br> Her husband.<br> I knew him well.<br> Didn't you say<br> edouard?<br> His intimates<br> called him etienne.<br> A pet name.<br> Clarissa, i always say<br> it doesn't pay to inquire<br> too closely into the background<br> of us summer saratoga folk.<br> Take you, clarissa.<br> You call yourself a lady,<br> but that doesn't necessarily<br> mean that you are one, does it?<br> I advise you to stay<br> out of this, sophie.<br> I was merely going to<br> remark in all innocence<br> that my family<br> can remember<br> when your family<br> climbed out of the gutter.<br> Come,<br> mrs. Du chenfrais.<br> Shall we have<br> a bit of a chat?<br> That would be<br> charming.<br> Enchanted to have met you,<br> madame van steed.<br> You're all that your dear son<br> has led me to expect.<br> I hope you weren't<br> too sharp<br> with that very<br> provincial old lady.<br> Provincial old lady?<br> She's an old hellcat.<br> Thank you very much for<br> being helpful. Good-bye.<br> Nonsense, my girl. I want to<br> talk to you. It's important.<br> In the garden?<br> No. In your room.<br> We can talk better there.<br> If you'd asked me<br> who i'd rather be<br> than anyone else in the<br> world at this minute,<br> i'd say you.<br> Me? But why?<br> No reason.<br> No reason, my girl.<br> Except that you're young<br> and beautiful and smart,<br> and you've got two dashing<br> young men in love with you.<br> At least, poor bart would<br> dash if that old harridan<br> would let go of his coattails<br> long enough to let him dash.<br> And you'd be very rich<br> if you use some sense.<br> Angelique,<br> bring the coffee in here.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Just what is it<br> you want of me?<br> Money.<br> I have no money.<br> But you will have.<br> How?<br> Listening to me.<br> You have no money. Why haven't<br> you listened to yourself?<br> Because i'm not you. I explained<br> that to you a minute ago.<br> Tell your woman<br> to shut the door.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> She knows<br> everything.<br> She never talks.<br> No, thank you.<br> If you mean to harm me,<br> she'd be likely to kill you.<br> She'd make a little figure<br> like you out of soap,<br> and she'd stick pins into it,<br> and you'd sicken and die.<br> Not i. I've had pins<br> stuck in me all my life-<br> knives and everything<br> up to pickaxes.<br> All my life, mrs. Bellop,<br> i've been very direct.<br> If i wanted<br> to do a thing<br> and it was possible, i did<br> it. I say what i want to say.<br> That old lady<br> on the piazza dislikes me.<br> She makes no pretense.<br> I admire her for it.<br> I shall be grateful<br> if you'll be as honest.<br> You're right.<br> She hates you.<br> She wants to run you<br> out of saratoga,<br> and she'll do it<br> unless...<br> unless?<br> Look, my girl,<br> i know that you're no more<br> the countess de trumprechoochoo<br> than<br> i'm queen victoria.<br> But if i say you are,<br> if i stand up for you<br> against that old buzzard and her crew,<br> the world will<br> believe you are.<br> I've watched you, and i'll say<br> this, you've been wonderful-<br> bold and dramatic<br> and believable.<br> But from now on,<br> you're gonna need a<br> strong arm behind you,<br> and that handsome texan's<br> arm isn't gonna be enough.<br> It's got to be<br> a woman<br> that's smarter than old lady van steed<br> and somebody that<br> she's scared of.<br> That's me.<br> You saw it.<br> I look like<br> a wash woman,<br> but i've got family<br> and influence,<br> and all she's got are<br> two generations of money.<br> What do you want?<br> I know my way<br> around this world.<br> I know what it is<br> to be very rich,<br> and i know what it is<br> to be very poor.<br> I've lived on nothing<br> for years... in luxury.<br> Blackmail?<br> Oh, give me credit for<br> being smarter than that.<br> I make certain hotels<br> fashionable by touting for them.<br> I put saratoga<br> on the map.<br> I made newport, though i must<br> say i can't bear the place.<br> I've been everywhere. I know<br> europe, and i know america.<br> And if i give a party that<br> somebody else pays for,<br> everybody comes<br> because i'm giving it.<br> Don't ask me why.<br> I don't know.<br> I've got<br> nothing to lose<br> because<br> i live by my wits.<br> They can't take<br> those away from me.<br> And i say and i do<br> as i please<br> because i'm not<br> afraid of anybody.<br> It's a grand<br> feeling.<br> In a way,<br> you're just like i am.<br> I've always-<br> i know<br> all about you.<br> I have connections<br> in new orleans.<br> How much do you want?<br> Your name<br> was clio dulaine,<br> and now you want it to be<br> mrs. Bartholomew van steed.<br> I think you can get him<br> with my help,<br> though<br> why you want him<br> with that texan<br> around-<br> me, i'd marry him though<br> he hadn't a penny.<br> Those shoulders<br> and small through the hips,<br> and the way<br> he looks at you-<br> oh, me!<br> Always was a fool.<br> I'll take 25,000 down<br> on the day of the wedding<br> and 10,000 a year for life.<br> I don't want to be grasping.<br> How do you know that<br> i can't do this alone?<br> Try it.<br> Come in.<br> Edouard. Etienne.<br> Are you two<br> plotting something?<br> You look guilty<br> as all get out.<br> If i were only 25<br> years younger, my boy-<br> mrs. Bellop has offered<br> to be my chaperone.<br> A little late,<br> i'd say.<br> Not too late,<br> we hope.<br> Not too late<br> for what?<br> For social<br> success<br> and marriage<br> to someone<br> who's really<br> mad about her,<br> with<br> your blessing.<br> She's got that now.<br> I'll see you later.<br> I got to pack my bag.<br> Pardon me.<br> Clint!<br> I almost forgot to<br> tell you, honey.<br> I'm taking<br> a little trip.<br> Where?<br> Where are you going?<br> Albany.<br> What for?

I heard,<br> and i won't pretend<br> that it was accidental.<br> Why doesn't<br> he understand?<br> What man ever did?<br> It isn't the money!<br> I want security,<br> protection, respectability-<br> things that have been very scarce<br> on my side of the<br> family, even my own mama.<br> I know about your mother and her<br> mother and all the other generations<br> of getting the dirty end<br> of the bargain.<br> Mama and all she<br> stood in new orleans<br> and all that<br> i saw in paris,<br> that was something to<br> make one really sick!<br> I won't be treated<br> like her!<br> I won't! I won't!<br> No need to, if you follow my advice.<br> No, mrs. Bellop.<br> I think i'll just<br> go on alone.<br> I don't want you<br> to think i'm ungrateful.<br> You've been honest,<br> and you've been good.<br> Here.
