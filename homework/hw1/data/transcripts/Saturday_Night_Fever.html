I'll just have tea.<br> Tea with lemon.<br> I started drinking tea recently, you know.<br> It's really a lot more refined.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> All those women executives<br> in my office,<br> they all drink tea with lemon.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.<br> - I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.<br> - Yeah.<br> You see, like, I've only been<br> at this agency a really short time,<br> but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,<br> public relations capacity, you know.<br> I fill in for the agents<br> when they're elsewhere.<br> Like, this week, you know, I had...<br> I had business lunches<br> with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque<br> - and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.<br> - Oh, far out.<br> Yeah.

I didn't!<br> The thing is<br> the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,<br> it's not being the best<br> or nothing like that.<br> The only thing is<br> that I would like to get that high<br> someplace else in my life. You know?<br> Like where?<br> I don't know where.<br> I don't know. Someplace.<br> You see, dancing, it can't last forever.<br> It's a short-lived kind of thing.<br> But I'm getting older, you know.<br> You know, I feel like...<br> I feel like, you know,<br> so what, I'm getting older.<br> Does that mean, like, I can't feel<br> that way about nothing left in my life?<br> You know?
