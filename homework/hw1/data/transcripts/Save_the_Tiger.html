I'm sorry.<br> Go back to the office, will you?<br> Get together with Meyer and line out<br> the orders. I'm gonna take a walk.<br> I'll see you at the office.<br> Hey, Mister. Wanna help us save the tiger?<br> Only takes a signature.<br> Only 556 of them left.<br> Think we ought to keep them around,<br> don't you?<br> Yeah.<br> - How's Cuban Pete?<br> - Cuban Pete?<br> He took a walk, he feels great.<br> How much did we write?<br> - A little over three. They ate it up.<br> - What did I tell you?<br> I'm going home.<br> You want to have dinner with us?<br> I don't think so.<br> Can I borrow one of your shirts?<br> Help yourself. That's two you owe me.<br> Salesmen are happy? What'd they say?<br> The usual, "Can we deliver?"<br> Meyer's going over the orders.<br> He wants to see you.<br> Well, with what we wrote<br> discounted at the bank...<br> and Charlie, we're gonna squeeze through.<br> I checked Swissair, they got a flight<br> to Geneva, stops in New York.<br> Good idea. You can see your daughter<br> before we go to jail.<br> You wanna go fishing, right, Phil?<br> And we got to get out of bed<br> every morning.<br> At least I don't get out of bed<br> in Beverly Hills.<br> Well, how I lead my life doesn't have<br> anything to do with our business.<br> Just takes a little pressure off<br> when your nut isn't sky high.<br> It's my pressure, Phil, my nut.<br> Except when it spills off.<br> Like this afternoon at the show.<br> It's a criminal act, Harry!<br> What criminal act, Phil?<br> To keep people working?<br> That's what you yourself said<br> this morning, isn't it?<br> Is it a criminal act to try to hang on<br> to 15 years of hard work?<br> What the hell was our dream?<br> To meet a payroll and not a pay check.<br> Wasn't that the dream?<br> That was the big slice of the pie.<br> Everybody in this whole God damn<br> country dances around the law, Phil.<br> - Now what's a criminal act? You tell me.<br> - So the end justifies the means.<br> Well, that's what they got<br> up on the scoreboard, baby.<br> - That's the way they play it.<br> - Who's "they?" We're "they."<br> - And there are rules.<br> - Wrong.<br> Used to be.<br> No more rules, just referees.<br> And no room out there for losers,<br> believe me.<br> You and me out on that street again?<br> Why, Christ! What would we do?<br> Where would we go?<br> We're obsolete. You want logic, Phil.<br> And there is no Ministry of Logic,<br> in this country.<br> Performance used to count, right?<br> For 15 years we've met our obligations<br> with the same unions...<br> the same mills, the same bank, but today...<br> all they care about is the bottom line<br> on a passbook...<br> and then some God damn machine<br> gives you a bum credit rating.<br> So history doesn't count anymore.<br> It's our place, Phil, we don't get down<br> on our knees to anybody.<br> You expect me to buy that crap?<br> For Christ's sakes, Harry,<br> don't you understand?<br> It's people like us, people in<br> the middle, that made this country work.<br> And when people like ourselves<br> get into this kind of thing...<br> it takes it all down.<br> That's what's ripping the country apart!<br> Son of a bitch,<br> don't you sell America, to me!<br> I've got friends over there sitting under<br> the sand with bikinis on their heads!<br> I used to get goose bumps<br> every time I looked at that flag.<br> When I was a kid, sitting alone<br> in the room playing the radio...<br> if they ever played the national anthem,<br> I stood up all alone in the room.<br> I stood up at attention.<br> Don't sell me America!<br> Now they're making<br> jock straps out of the flag.<br> Maybe it's terrific.<br> Maybe it's healthy, I don't know.<br> But I do know there are no more rules.<br> That stinks, Harry.<br> Hello, Boss.<br> - Don't call me Boss.<br> - But you are.<br> You built the business,<br> you got the accounts, you made it work.<br> Don't call me Boss.<br> How's everything looking?<br> I don't want to talk about the line.<br> Meyer, I need Rico and I need you,<br> now what do you want me to say?<br> Harry, I'm old.<br> I can't be in a playpen with fairies.<br> Even talented fairies.<br> You have a job here till you die.<br> But you need Rico. Tell me to get out.<br> I don't want you out, Meyer.<br> What do you want? Come on, tell me.<br> I'm listening. I'm an old stone.<br> Tell me, what do you want?<br> Another season.<br> That's all? Another season?<br> Just survival? No dreams? No hope?<br> Hope?<br> Better ask the little old lady in Vegas<br> with the Dixie cup full of nickels...<br> if she still has hope.<br> She's still looking for the three cherries.<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you.<br> You're sorry for me?<br> You've spent most of your life<br> running from pogroms, Nazis.<br> Bent over a machine.<br> What the hell have you got?<br> I have my craft. My work. And a woman.<br> Old, but still lovely.<br> I like to look at her, to listen to her talk.<br> So sweet. And it's every day.<br> That's good.<br> Yeah, that's good. Now get out of here.<br> Let me work. I'll deal with the fairy.<br> We've had our talk. Go to your mansion.<br> Go to your Mexican cook.<br> Go and speak Spanish to your Mexican cook.<br> - For Christ's sake, Meyer.<br> - Go home, Harry. Get some sleep.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Good night, Harry.<br> Good night, Meyer.<br> - Hello?<br> - Babe? Hi, how was the flight?<br> I don't know. I took some pills,<br> I slept through it. I was going to call you.<br> I don't know. I took some pills,<br> I slept through it. I was going to call you.<br> - How'd the show go?<br> - Just fine.<br> - That's marvelous.<br> - Yeah, it was just fine.<br> You sound tired. Why don't you go home?<br> Carmela has something prepared.<br> Janet, how would you like<br> to make it with me right now?<br> A couple of old veterans like us<br> can do it with words.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, I'm all right.<br> Remember that time,<br> in the South of France?<br> That room over the little French restaurant?<br> In Saint-Tropez?<br> God, we made love like a couple of kids.<br> Up, down, sideways, every way.<br> Candlelight, it was beautiful.<br> Who was that singer, remember?<br> We could hear her voice<br> through the shutters.<br> God, I can't remember her name,<br> what was her name?<br> Franoise Hardy.<br> Franoise Hardy, that's it, yeah.<br> You remember. God, that was a sweet time.<br> That was six years ago, Harry.<br> For God's sake, get out<br> of the God damn office. Go home.<br> Carmela has something prepared.<br> I'll call you tomorrow. Goodbye, Harry.<br> - Man in the silk suit.<br> - Yep.<br> - You put in a long day, mister.<br> - Every day.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Nowhere.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah, really.<br> Well, listen, I'm house sitting out<br> at the beach. Want to take me?<br> Jesus, why not?<br> Mobile R-X 1-3-1-1-1 calling.<br> Good evening, could you get me<br> No me esperes.<br> - Knocks me out.<br> - What?<br> A car phone, it's far out.<br> You must be rich.<br> Sometimes.<br> Your wife Spanish?<br> The maid.<br> How come you speak Spanish?<br> Well, my father had a store...<br> in the first Puerto Rican neighborhood<br> in New York. When I was a kid...<br> after school I used to work there.<br> - What kind of store?<br> - Pharmacy.<br> - You mean a drugstore?<br> - Yeah, a drugstore.<br> - Did you turn on?<br> - Turn on?<br> Hell, we didn't know uppers, downers,<br> or any of the...<br> If you were lucky then you got an enema.<br> Enema.<br> It's a long ride to the beach.<br> It's all right, I want to see the ocean again.<br> Get out of that zoo for a change.<br> I really hate zoos.<br> Those animals are so miserable.<br> I saw this National Geographic<br> about lions and tigers...<br> how they always return<br> to a place of remembered beauty.<br> That's how they catch them.<br> If your fairy godmother showed up<br> and you had three wishes...<br> what would you wish for?<br> Peace, and harmony...<br> and to make it with Mick Jagger.<br> Jesus!<br> Well, I guess there's nothing wrong<br> with that.<br> I just happen to have<br> some really great grass.<br> God. Why did you want<br> to ball me this morning?<br> I don't know.<br> You looked nice, you smelled nice.<br> You still do.<br> I was a little stoned,<br> just sort of popped out.<br> I'm really 21.<br> I kind of figured that, yeah.<br> You dig grass?<br> Do I... grass? Christ, I haven't had<br> any of that for years.<br> We used to call it gage.<br> - Gage?<br> - Yeah.<br> So when I was a kid I was a drummer.<br> And musicians have their own...<br> lingo, you know, we called it gage.<br> Gage.<br> - Got those in Italy.<br> - In a fight?<br> - In a war.<br> - In Italy?<br> - In Italy.<br> - We never fought a war with Italy.<br> You'd be amazed what we did in Italy.<br> - Well...<br> - You're older than 33.<br> Yeah. You got another joint?<br> - Tell me.<br> - What?<br> Tell me how old you are.<br> And there was Kamu,<br> swimming against the tides.<br> Swimming against the tide.<br> Swimming against the tide.<br> I'm standing, I'm looking over the River<br> Jordan with Moses and Albert Speer.<br> And Moses says,<br> "Tell me, Al, did you really know..."<br> "did you know?"<br> And Speer starts screaming:<br> "Me?
