This is bullshit?<br> Shooting prisoners is OK?<br> lt's against the goddamn rules!<br> The rules just walked<br> off with your friend.<br> But l guess that was<br> the decent thing to do,<br> huh, Captain?<br> Get your gear.

How'd you guess that?<br> Looks like you guys<br> got hit pretty hard.<br> Yes, sir. Small unit action.<br> They beat the hell<br> out of us with 88s.<br> Sir, if you're our relief,<br> l'm gonna file a complaint.<br> l wouldn't blame you.<br> Who's your CO?<br> lt would have been<br> Captain Jennings, sir.<br> The best we can muster now<br> is a corporal.<br> So, what are you guys<br> all about?<br> We're here for him. Ryan.<br> Me, sir?<br> James Francis Ryan of lowa?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Payton, lowa, that's correct.<br> What is this about?<br> Your brothers<br> were killed in combat.<br> Which...which ones?<br> All of them.<br> Uh...On...on the level?<br> Yeah. l'm afraid so.<br> Uh...You might want<br> to take some time with this.<br> lf there's someplace<br> you want to go and...<br> - What's this all about?<br> - Ryan lost his brothers.<br> - Which one?<br> - All of them.<br> You...<br> You came all the way<br> out here to tell me that?<br> Well, you're...<br> you're going home.<br> Our orders are<br> to bring you back.<br> Bring me back?<br> Corporal Henderson...l don't<br> mean to leave you short-handed,<br> but orders are orders.<br> When are you being relieved?<br> Sir, we have no way to tell.<br> My orders don't include me<br> abandoning my post.<br> l understand that,<br> but this changes things.<br> l don't see that it does, sir.<br> The Chief of Staff for the<br> United States Army says it does.<br> Sir, we have<br> to hold this bridge.<br> The 82nd have taken out<br> every bridge across the Merderet<br> except two,<br> at Valognes and here.<br> lf the Germans take 'em,<br> we'll have to displace.<br> Private, your outfit stays,<br> but your party's over here.<br> Sir, l can't leave<br> until reinforcements...<br> You got three minutes.<br> Sir, what about them?<br> There's barely...<br> Hey, asshole!<br> Two of our guys already died<br> trying to find you, all right?<br> Sir?<br> That's right.<br> What were their names?<br> lrwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.<br> Wade and...<br> Caparzo.<br> lt doesn't make any sense.<br> lt doesn't make sense, sir.<br> Why do l deserve to go?<br> Why not these guys?<br> They fought just as hard!<br> ls that what they're<br> supposed to tell your mother<br> when they send her another<br> folded American flag?<br> Tell her that when you found me,<br> l was here with the only<br> brothers l have left,<br> and that there's no way<br> l was gonna desert them.<br> l think she'll understand that.<br> There's no way<br> l'm leaving this bridge.<br> What are your orders?<br> Sergeant, we have crossed<br> some strange boundary here.<br> The world has taken<br> a turn for the surreal.<br> Clearly, but the question<br> still stands.<br> l don't know. What do you think?<br> You don't want to know<br> what l think.<br> No, Mike, l do.<br> Well... part of me<br> thinks the kid's right.<br> What's he done to deserve this?<br> lf he wants to stay here,<br> fine, let's leave him.<br> Yeah.<br> But another part<br> of me thinks...<br> what if by some miracle we stay<br> and actually make it<br> out of here?<br> Someday we might look<br> back and decide<br> that saving Private Ryan<br> was the one decent thing<br> we were able to pull out of this<br> whole God-awful, shitty mess.<br> That's what l was thinking, sir.<br> Like you said, Captain,<br> if we do that...we all earn<br> the right to go home.<br> Oh, brother.<br> This is everything.<br> Two .30-calibre machine guns,<br> You got two bazookas,<br> but only eight rounds left,<br> and assorted small arms.<br> An arty round took out<br> our .60 mortar.<br> Might as well be spit wads<br> if they use tanks.<br> - Which they're sure to.<br> - What you thinking, sir?<br> Well...<br> l think they're going to try<br> to whip around the flanks...<br> Unless we draw them up<br> here between these buildings,<br> where all the rubble makes<br> a bit of a bottleneck.<br> - Disable him?<br> - lf we can.<br> Make the tank a 60-ton<br> roadblock, we'll have a chance.<br> Yes, sir,<br> don't let them mass anywhere.<br> Hit hard and fall back<br> to the bridge.<br> Machine gun moving, number two<br> up high to piss on their heads.<br> That would be the idea.<br> Jackson?<br> lf we can, l'd like to get<br> you up in that bell tower.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Give you company if need be.<br> Yes, sir. Company couldn't hurt.<br> l'd say a .30 with about<br> Parker, job opportunity.<br> Not the worst idea, Captain.<br> But it all depends on knocking<br> out the tank here, right?<br> So how do you<br> plan on doing that?<br> Reiben's right.<br> As our esteemed colleague<br> from the Airborne pointed out,<br> what we got here is spit wads,<br> so how do we stop the tank?<br> Give it a rabbit to chase.<br> We could hit the tank<br> in the tracks.<br> Yeah, but with what?<br> We could try a sticky bomb.<br> Sticky bomb, sir?<br> - Sir, are you making that up?<br> - No. lt's in the field manual.<br> Well, we're out<br> of field manuals, sir.<br> Perhaps you can enlighten us?<br> Right, you have demolition -<br> some TNT or composition B?<br> l got that bridge wired<br> with enough to blow it twice.<br> You can spare some, then.<br> You take<br> a standard-issue Gl sock,<br> cram it with as much<br> Comp' B as possible,<br> rig up a simple fuse,<br> then coat the whole<br> thing with axle grease.<br> When you throw it,<br> it should stick.<br> lt's a bomb that sticks.<br> A sticky bomb.<br> You know a better way to knock<br> the tracks off a tank, tell me.<br> This is good. Now we got<br> to surrender our socks.<br> Haul away.<br> Select the field of fire.<br> Cross with the bell tower.<br> l can cover 1 2 to nine here.<br> - Easy!<br> - l got her!<br> Here are the mines.<br> For being the best we can do,<br> that forward machine gun is not<br> in a terrible firing position.<br> And this position right here...<br> this is the Alamo.<br> They push us back here,<br> last man blows the bridge.<br> We only got a 30-second fuse,<br> so that last man better hurry,<br> or he won't be alive long.<br> Captain?<br> Where am l during all this?<br> Never more than two feet from<br> me, and that's not negotiable.<br> l'll get some ammo. Come on.<br> - Upham.<br> - Yes.<br> - Listen, all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Listening?<br> - Yes.<br> All right, we'll be displacing<br> and falling back like crazy...<br> So be Johnny-on-the-spot<br> with ammo or we're dead.<br> - Right.<br> - Understand?<br> - Johnny-on-the-spot.<br> - You all right?<br> Yeah.<br> When we shipped out of England,<br> l told the supply sergeant<br> handing out cigarettes,<br> ''l don't smoke.''<br> ''l don't smoke.''<br> Quite a situation, huh?<br> Unbelievable.<br> Here.<br> Fucked up beyond<br> all recognition, right?<br> Yeah, you got that right.<br> Fubar.<br> - Yeah, well...<br> - Fubar.<br> lt'll be a real show, huh?<br> Take it easy.<br> Fubar.<br> Who's that singing, sir?<br> Edith Piaf.<br> What's she so upset about?<br> Her lover left her,<br> but she still sees his face<br> everywhere she goes.<br> That would do it.<br> ''Even life itself<br> ''only represents you.<br> ''Sometimes l dream<br> that l'm in your arms.''<br> What was that part?<br> She sang that before.<br> The chorus.<br> ''And you speak softly<br> in my ear...<br> ''and you say things<br> ''that make my eyes close,<br> ''and l find that marvellous.''<br> Uh, again...Upham, uh...<br> to be honest, l...l find myself<br> curiously aroused by you.<br> Marvellous. No, it's...<br> it's a melancholy song.<br> At the beginning, she says,<br> ''And then one day, you left.<br> ''You left me, and, uh...<br> l've been desperate ever since.<br> ''l see you all over the sky,<br> l see you all over the earth.''<br> Any more of this, the Krauts<br> won't have to shoot me.<br> l'll just slit my own wrists.<br> You're a strange bird, Upham.<br> Sorry, it's Edith, you know.<br> You know what<br> that song reminds me of?<br> What Mrs Rachel Troubowitz<br> said when l left for Basic.<br> What, ''Don't touch me''?<br> No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz<br> is our super's wife.<br> She tries things on in my mom's<br> shop, and she's, like, a 44-EE.<br> - Double-E?<br> - These things are massive.<br> Those are big.<br> l've got her convinced<br> that she's, like, a 42-D.<br> So she's trying to squeeze<br> into this side-cut,<br> silk-ribboned,<br> triple-panel girdle<br> with the shelf-lift brassiere.<br> And it's beautiful,<br> she's just pouring out of it.<br> lt's beautiful, and she can tell<br> l got a hard-on the size<br> of the Statue of Liberty.<br> And she says,<br> ''Richard, calm down.''<br> And says,<br> ''When you're over there,<br> ''if you see anything<br> that upsets you,<br> ''just close your eyes and think<br> of these. You understand?''<br> So l said, ''Yes, ma'am.''<br> Are you all right, sir?<br> Yeah, just keeping the rhythm.<br> ls it true you were<br> a teacher back home?<br> Yes.<br> See, that's something<br> l could never do<br> Not after the way we treated<br> our teachers. No, sir.<br> l had a thousand kids like you.<br> l can't see my brothers' faces.<br> l've been trying,<br> and l can't see them.<br> Has that ever happened to you?<br> You gotta think of a context.<br> What does that mean?<br> Well, you think about<br> something specific...<br> something you've done together.<br> When l think of home,<br> l think of something specific.<br> l think of my hammock<br> in the backyard or...<br> my wife pruning the rose bushes<br> in a pair of my old work gloves.<br> Well, this one night,<br> two of my brothers came<br> and woke me up in<br> the middle of the night,<br> and they said they had<br> a surprise for me.<br> They took me to the barn,<br> into the loft, and...<br> there was<br> my oldest brother Dan...<br> with Alice...Alice Jardine.<br> l mean...picture a girl who took<br> a nosedive from the ugly tree<br> and hit every branch<br> coming down.<br> And...and Dan's<br> got her shirt off.<br> So he's working on this bra,<br> and all of a sudden,<br> Sean just screams out...<br> ''Danny, you're a young man!<br> Don't do it!''<br> And Alice Jardine screams,<br> and jumps up,<br> and tries to get out,<br> but this shirt's over her head,<br> and she runs into the wall<br> and knocks herself out.<br> So now Dan is so mad,<br> he starts coming after us,<br> but Alice is there unconscious,<br> he's gotta wake her up.<br> So he grabs her leg,<br> and he's dragging her.<br> And he picks up a shovel<br> and goes after Sean.<br> Sean says, ''Why are you trying<br> to hit me? l did you a favour.''<br> And this makes Dan more angry.<br> He tries to swing this thing.<br> lt goes out of his grasp<br> and hits a kerosene lantern.<br> The thing explodes, and<br> the whole barn almost goes up.<br> That was it...Dan went<br> to Basic next day.<br> That was the last night<br> the four of us were together.<br> That was two years ago.<br> Tell me about your wife<br> and those rose bushes.<br> No.<br> No. That one l save just for me.<br> Enemy from the east.<br> He sees Tiger tanks, two of 'em.<br> Panzer tanks, two of 'em.<br> lnfantry,<br> Disperse!
