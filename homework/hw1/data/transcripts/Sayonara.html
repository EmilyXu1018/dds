What for?<br> -Why not?<br> Wouldn`t you like to tango<br> with one of those beautiful Japanese dolls?<br> lf it`s your prescription, Doc,<br> then l`ll certainly work at it the best l can.<br> You`re going to Kobe.<br> Kelly has your orders.<br> What in the world am l going to do in Kobe?<br> lt`s a special request<br> of General Webster himself.<br> Then this has all been pre-arranged.<br> Pre-arranged? Demanded.<br> Why shouldn`t a three-star general<br> look out for a four-star general`s son?<br> Now don`t be getting on my back.<br> l ain`t bucking for favors.<br> l know you`re not. l was just kidding.<br> -l`ll see you, Doc. Thanks.<br> -Could l have a word with you, Gruver?<br> Yeah, l`ll bet you l know what the word is.<br> K-E-L-L-Y. ls that true or false?<br> He`s got permission to go back<br> and marry that Japanese girl.<br> l told him he can`t take her<br> back to the States.<br> l explained the law in detail myself.<br> But there`s no law<br> which says he can`t marry her.<br> And he`s appealed to his congressman.<br> -His congressman?<br> -l wish you`d talk to him.<br> After all, he is one of your men.<br> You`re the only human being he looks up to.<br> Now listen....<br> l`ll tell you something.<br> That boy don`t look up to anybody.<br> He has been promoted four times<br> and busted right back again.<br> Yeah, my congressman.<br> Shocking, ain`t it, Major?<br> Chaplain says, ``Don`t marry the girl.``<br> Colonel says, ``Don`t marry the girl.``<br> You say, ``Don`t marry the girl.``<br> Congressman says,<br> ``You marry that girl, Kelly.``<br> What can l do?<br> l`ll tell you what.<br> You can go home<br> and marry your congressman.<br> You`d be better off.<br> Give me more coffee.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hear you bagged two more today, Major.<br> -Yes.<br> -How was it up there?<br> lt was splendid.<br> What`s the matter? What happened?<br> There was a guy with a face<br> in one of those planes today.<br> There was a guy with a face<br> in all the other seven you shot down.<br> Yeah.<br> That`s exactly what l`ve been thinking about.<br> You can stop thinking.<br> You got a very well-written contract here.<br> General Webster`s had you assigned to<br> the lnter-Service Aviation Board over there.<br> Which means you`ve got<br> practically nothing to do...<br> except, of course,<br> marry the General`s daughter...<br> who is arriving in Kobe tomorrow.<br> You mean, Eileen--<br> That`s right. General`s wife<br> and daughter both, from Tulsa.<br> -Listen, don`t fool me now.<br> -l`m not fooling, Major.<br> You`re not supposed to know<br> anything about it.

Wait.<br> That`s.... Now.<br> Boy, she sure does something wicked<br> to a bathing suit.<br> She has an enormous capacity<br> to fulfill a bathing suit.<br> -l can see that.<br> -That`s enough.<br> Listen, l`m just,<br> you know, showing it to you...<br> but all kidding aside,<br> the reason l want to show you this girl--<br> -You ever seen Katsumi?<br> -Where`s that?<br> lt`s not a ``Where`s that?``<br> That`s the girl l`m marrying.<br> No, l mean, l don`t know Japanese names.<br> That`s all right.

Don`t talk to me that way!<br> l won`t take that from you or anybody else!<br> l`m sorry, Kelly.<br> l`m sorry.<br> l`m just blowing my stack a little today.<br> But, boy, l mean it.<br> l want to tell you, when you tell me that<br> you`re gonna give up your citizenship...<br> for a girl, l mean, any girl...<br> l think you`re nuts.<br> -l mean, l think you`re crazy.<br> -l am crazy.<br> l`m in-love crazy.<br> l think you`re going to cut your throat<br> and l`d just hate to see you do it.<br> And l mean this with all sincerity.<br> Maybe that`s because you don`t feel<br> as strong about your girl as l do mine.<br> There`s your orders, Major.<br> See you on the plane.<br> Okay.<br> We`re coming in, Major.<br> -There`s the inland sea. Beautiful, ain`t it?<br> -Yeah.<br> Boy, it sure is nice scenery out there.<br> That`s Kobe over there.<br> You see it, with all the docks?<br> You know, what you`re looking at<br> really is three cities running together.<br> There`s Kobe, Osaka, and Kyoto.<br> -They got kabuki there.<br> -What`s kabuki?<br> You never heard of kabuki theater?<br> -No.<br> -All men, no dames.<br> -That`s going to be dull, isn`t it?<br> -l don`t know.<br> lf it`s all dames you want,<br> l think we`re going to get there in about....<br> Yep.

He`s the one l met.<br> He`s very famous.<br> -That Nakamura?<br> -Yeah.<br> lt`s about a lady who turns into a lion.<br> He`s going....<br> She`s going to turn into a lion right here?<br> l want to see that.<br> l love you, Lloyd. l love you terribly.<br> l always have, and l guess l always will.<br> l love you, honey.<br> Awful glad you`re here, too.<br> Everybody acting like<br> nobody ever kisses a woman.<br> She wouldn`t be half so ugly if she didn`t<br> stick her face in that flour barrel.<br> She?<br> Well, whatever it was.<br> You got me.<br> He`s a male actress.<br> lt says here<br> they`ve been trained since childhood...<br> to have the grace of a woman,<br> and yet the power of a man.<br> My word.<br> My lord, that`s my father!<br> ls he man enough now for you, Lloyd?<br> ls that the same fellow?<br> All right, boy.<br> l am sure it must be very difficult...<br> to enjoy theater so different from your own.<br> -We found it fascinating.<br> -l am glad.<br> Kabuki is very old, isn`t it?<br> Some 300 years.<br> l find myself becoming intrigued<br> by everything in Japan.<br> l should be happy to help you<br> know my country better...<br> if at any time l can.<br> You did not enjoy the evening so much,<br> l fear, Maj. Gruver.<br> Yeah, l thought it was a fine play.<br> l thought you could use a Marilyn Monroe<br> here and there, you know.<br> Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred...<br> from kabuki in the 1 7th century.<br> l didn`t mean to sound corny.<br> l just didn`t know what to say about it.<br> Please, do not apologize.<br> l am great admirer of Miss Monroe...<br> myself.<br> That`s two of us. That`s you and me, boy.<br> No, don`t do it to me. l did real good.<br> Thank you very much.<br> -Fine art.<br> -Let`s go and see the garden.<br> Okay, you go on. l`ll take this.<br> That`s fine.

Very good.<br> Here you are, honey.<br> -No, thank you.<br> -Don`t care for any?<br> -Sit down, darling.<br> -You look awful pretty.<br> l`ve been doing a lot of thinking<br> with you away, Lloyd.<br> Answer me one thing.<br> -What`s that, honey?<br> -Why aren`t we married now?<br> -lsn`t that a silly question?<br> -No, not really.<br> You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.<br> l suppose the Korean War<br> might have a little something to do with it.<br> Wasn`t Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?<br> -Convenient?<br> -What l really mean is...<br> do l mean everything to you,<br> as you do to me?<br> Of course you do--<br> You see, l went to visit your mother<br> before l came here, there in Richmond.<br> My mother?<br> l was appalled at the loneliness<br> in which she lives...<br> and the way your father is content<br> to go off...<br> and leave her walled up within a circle<br> of friends while he plunges off to the war--<br> Honey, now, you just hold on a second.<br> You got to remember something.<br> My father`s a general, honey.<br> And besides that,<br> my mother wants to live that way.<br> -Don`t be ridiculous.<br> -What do you mean? Don`t tell me--<br> No woman wants to live any way except<br> body and soul with the man she loves.<br> You`ll never tuck me away<br> in the corner of some little town.<br> Go ahead and become the greatest general<br> in Air Force history, but love me, too.<br> But l do love you, baby, l do.<br> l guess all l`m trying to say is that...<br> and l really mean this, Lloyd...<br> if what you want is a family,<br> like our fathers have...<br> and promotion in the Air Force, and<br> position in society like our mothers have...<br> and you marry me<br> because l`m pretty and smart...<br> and have guts and will know the ropes...<br> then l don`t think<br> you ought to marry me, Lloyd.<br> l`m sorry.<br> l guess l`ve been thinking too much.<br> Yeah, l think you have been<br> thinking too much.<br> -Now, quit it.<br> -Okay.<br> l don`t know,<br> maybe things will turn out after all.<br> What do you mean, maybe?<br> Sure, it`s gonna turn out.<br> Just all that nonsense you talk about<br> every time we get together.<br> Nonsense? l hadn`t realized<br> it was nonsense.<br> Of course it is, honey.<br> Listen, it`s all very simple.<br> Now, lookit.<br> l want a wife and a family.<br> l want a home in America.<br> Every time l think of having a home like that,<br> l always think about it with a girl like you.<br> l mean, a girl with<br> a good Army background like my own.<br> What do you mean, ``a girl like me``?<br> l`m not a type. l`m me.<br> Lloyd, it`s me you`ve got to love.<br> Lloyd, haven`t you ever felt...<br> like grabbing me and hauling me off<br> to a shack somewhere?<br> What`s the matter with you?<br> You know better. Of course l have.<br> -Then what`s holding you back?<br> -Are you ever going to grow up, honey?<br> Don`t you know there`s a right time<br> and a wrong time to do things?<br> Don`t you realize<br> you have responsibilities to other people?<br> That you have a position to fulfill,<br> that you`re not alone in this world?<br> You defend yourself like a fort!<br> No matter how l defend myself, you have<br> to understand that l am not in a position...<br> to be hauling my fiance away<br> to a shack somewhere...<br> like a alley cat or something like that.<br> l wasn`t brought up that way.<br> You`ll do everything that`s expected of you?<br> l`m certainly going to try, l`ll tell you that.<br> l don`t expect you to marry me<br> just because it`s expected of you.<br> Listen, sometimes l look at you,<br> and l don`t understand you.<br> l don`t know what`s going on in your brain.<br> Sometimes, l don`t know who you are...<br> or what you`re all about.<br> Maybe you don`t. Maybe you never will.<br> -``...so long as ye both shall live?``<br> -l will.<br> Katsumi, ``Wilt thou have this man<br> to thy wedded husband...<br> ``to live together after God`s ordinance<br> in the holiest state of matrimony?<br> ``Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor<br> and keep him, in sickness and in health...<br> ``and forsaking all others, keep thee only<br> unto him, so long as ye both shall live?``<br> -She will.<br> -She will.<br> ``lf any man can show just cause why<br> they may not be lawfully joined together...<br> ``let him now speak,<br> or else hereafter forever hold his peace.``<br> Do you realize you waive<br> all your legal rights in this marriage?<br> Look, l signed all the papers, didn`t l?<br> You`ll look after your wife on your own.<br> The Air Force is not responsible.<br> Yeah, l know. Romantic, ain`t it, Major?<br> Will you finish this ugly deed<br> and get it over?<br> l now pronounce you man and wife.<br> Sign over there.<br> Just a minute!<br> That`s it, Mrs. Kelly.<br> Just you and me now.<br> Where do we sign?<br> May as well witness this now, Major.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> lncidentally, it was an honor<br> meeting you, Maj. Gruver.<br> Thank you.<br> Tell me, Consul...<br> are all these ceremonies<br> conducted like that?<br> We do our best to prevent<br> as many as possible.<br> We make the paperwork so difficult,<br> a good many of them lose steam.<br> About how many Gls<br> have gone through this ceremony?<br> About 10,000.<br> Ten thousand?<br> Then you let a few slip by you, didn`t you?<br> A few, yes.<br> How`s your girl, Major?<br> Eileen?<br> l haven`t seen her in a couple days.<br> l`ve been moving in,<br> getting my things arranged.<br> She`s been hightailing it<br> with the brass, socializing.<br> Major...<br> ain`t you going to kiss the bride?<br> Sure l`m going to kiss the bride!<br> Yeah.<br> Sure.<br> Listen, l want you<br> to take good care of this boy, hear?<br> Here`s your ticket, honey. Don`t forget it.<br> Okay, boy.<br> Thanks, Major.<br> Took a lot of guts for you<br> to come here today.<br> Quit.<br> lf you want anybody taken care of,<br> or need a job done...<br> you West Point guys ain`t allowed<br> to do yourselves, l`m your man.<br> Hold it. l`m going to call on you.<br> -Come on. Let`s get a belt.<br> -All right.<br> -Nice to see you.<br> -How are you, Lloyd?<br> Just fine.<br> -That`s a pretty dress you got on.<br> -Thanks.<br> Lloyd, sit down, son.<br> All right.<br> -Thank you for coming over so promptly.<br> -That`s all right. l was darning my socks.<br> l don`t know exactly how to put this.<br> lt`s a little embarrassing, for me, that is.<br> l understand you were a witness<br> at a marriage yesterday...<br> between one of your men<br> and a Japanese girl.<br> Yeah, one man from my outfit in Korea.<br> You realize there`s an Army policy<br> to discourage all such marriages.<br> l think they couldn`t have been discouraged.<br> They`re very much in love.<br> l dare say.<br> However, the fact that you personally<br> seemed to sanction the marriage--<br> No. l didn`t mean to give<br> that impression at all.<br> l didn`t sanction it. As a matter of fact,<br> l tried to talk him out of it.<br> But, Lloyd, you did act as his witness.<br> As long as it`s going to be inevitable...<br> l thought l might try to make it<br> as pleasant as possible.<br> Don`t you see the position that puts me in?<br> Since l`m the Area Commander here, l--<br> No, you didn`t encourage this marriage, sir.<br> l believe l did all this on my own.<br> What do you mean, ``on your own,``<br> Lloyd, dear?<br> Everything you do reflects on the General.<br> After all, he is Eileen`s father.<br> l`m afraid this places me<br> in a position of incompetence...<br> when it comes to doing anything<br> to help my own men.<br> Let`s stop beating around the bush.<br> What`s wrong between you and Eileen?<br> You haven`t been to see her<br> for several days.<br> You talked about<br> being embarrassed, sir, before.<br> l`m embarrassed, too.<br> -What about?<br> -About my whole situation here.<br> l`m a pilot, sir. l was doing a job in Korea.<br> Unfinished job. Suddenly,<br> l`m pulled off that job and sent over here...<br> and plunked down at a desk<br> at this lnter-Service, whatever it is...<br> where, as far as l`m concerned,<br> there`s absolutely nothing to do.<br> All so as l can be with Eileen.<br> There`s nothing dishonest about it.<br> That is, if you plan to get married.<br> -l think l know how Lloyd feels.<br> -Do you plan to get married or not?<br> -Really, dear!<br> -l`m her mother. l want to know.<br> Mrs. Webster...<br> as of the moment,<br> Eileen isn`t too sure about it.<br> And l....<br> We know, Lloyd, dear. Now, look.<br> There`s evidently been some slight strain<br> between you two...<br> but don`t let it become too important.<br> This is Sunday night.<br> Why don`t you call her up...<br> and ask her out to dinner or something?<br> Mother, l found the dearest little shop at....<br> Hi, Lloyd.<br> Hello, Eileen.<br> Lloyd just came in to see you.<br> Yeah.<br> Listen, it`s Sunday night,<br> and l thought maybe...<br> you and l can go out<br> and catch a movie or something.<br> Feel like it?<br> l`m sorry, Lloyd.<br> l`m having dinner with some friends tonight.<br> What about tomorrow?<br> That`s booked, too, l`m afraid.<br> Looks as though<br> l`m holding some pretty tough cards.<br> What about next week?<br> Of course, Lloyd. Call me?<br> Okay.<br> Mrs. Webster, General.<br> Goodbye.<br> -Bye, Eileen.<br> -Bye, Lloyd.<br> Eileen! Why did you tell him<br> you were busy tonight?<br> Because l don`t want to see Lloyd Gruver<br> when you ask him to see me.<br> Besides...<br> l do have a date with that young Lieutenant<br> and his wife, from Fort Bragg.<br> Whole bunch of us.<br> l hope you don`t lose my man for me.<br> Boy, give me a martini, will you?<br> Nope, make it lemonade.<br> No, dog! Give me a scotch and soda.<br> Scotch and soda, sir.<br> There is such a thing as insolence<br> through manner, you know.<br> l hate to admit it,<br> but l guess that`s what l said.<br> l thought it sounded kind of strange...<br> coming from a guy<br> who shot down nine MlGs.<br> That`s kind of a reflex action.<br> l`m a West Point man, you know.<br> l guess it sneaks out sometimes.<br> Listen, Captain, what does a fellow do<br> around here after the sun goes down?<br> Why?<br> You on the loose?<br> Halfway.<br> Bring him another.<br> What part of the South are you from?<br> Almost any old place<br> that`s got an Army post on it.<br> l was all set to take the exams<br> at West Point...<br> and there was a teacher there...<br> who made me take a part in a school play.<br> They were doing<br> one of those Hungarian things by Molnr.<br> You never did hear a Hungarian play<br> played in a Southern accent, did you?<br> No, l`m afraid l missed that.<br> That`s a shame,<br> because l was awful good in it.<br> Anyhow, l suddenly didn`t want<br> to go to West Point...<br> and didn`t want to have anything<br> to do with it.<br> My mother come up to the school...<br> and she said, ``We always expected you<br> to go to the Point...<br> ``like your father and his father before him.``<br> l told her....<br> l said l had an idea<br> about a whole different way of life.<br> What did she say to that?<br> She said something like:<br> ``lf l ever once had that idea,<br> l shouldn`t let anything stop me.``<br> She couldn`t come right out and say,<br> ``Don`t go to the Point.``<br> But l know what she meant.<br> Then, of course, my father flew up<br> from Texas and--<br> He put you straight?<br> No, he just looked at me and said:<br> ``lf you don`t want to go to the Point,<br> don`t go to the Point.<br> ``The unhappiest men l know are those...<br> ``who are forced into something<br> they got no aptitude for.``<br> How did he force you to go to the Point?<br> That`s what l`m telling you.<br> He didn`t force me.<br> We just had a little talk,<br> and he flew back to Texas...<br> and l went on to the Point.<br> l see.<br> l`ll tell you something.<br> l never once had any regrets<br> about going to the Point.<br> Except, just lately...<br> l`ve had some old feeling come back on me.<br> l don`t know if l want to go on<br> in the Air Force and buck for a star...<br> and get married in the Webster family<br> and get swallowed up by all that.<br> l think maybe my old lady was right.<br> What does it all mean?<br> Eternal struggle, sex...<br> New York Yankees.<br> All right. Quit, now. Come on.<br> lsn`t that a nice-looking bridge?<br> Yeah, that`s the Bitchi-Bashi.<br> Say what?<br> The Bitchi-Bashi.<br> Bashi is Japanese for ``bridge.``<br> We call this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi...<br> because there`s so much lovely stuff<br> that goes over it.<br> Did you say stuff?<br> Brother, l said stuff.<br> Will you kindly tell me<br> what we`re standing in the bushes for?<br> Can`t touch it.<br> Why not?<br> You see, these girls that go over there<br> are the Matsubayashi girls.<br> They cross over there<br> on the way to the theater...<br> from those cells over there,<br> those dormitories.<br> That`s right. Somebody told me about that.<br> ls that anything going over there now?<br> -Come on. The goods are on display.<br> -Wait for me, buddy.<br> There`s Fumiko-san.<br> The one you saw me with.<br> -The little one in pink?<br> -Yeah, that`s the one!<br> You`re not going over there to say hello?<br> What, in public? A Matsubayashi girl?<br> Are you nuts?<br> -You take her to the officers` club.<br> -That`s for Americans.<br> Thought l could sneak her in there<br> without her being recognized.<br> -What happens if they catch them?<br> -lmmediate dismissal.<br> -No fooling?<br> -Yeah.<br> No Matsubayashi girl is allowed<br> to have dates of any kind.<br> You were dating her.<br> Yeah, well, l`m different.<br> -Get out of here.<br> -Like l told President Truman:<br> ``Harry, you was wrong<br> when you sold the Marines short.``<br> l hate to be stuffy about this,<br> but you Air Force men won`t understand.<br> Lord!<br> The marines have got I`amour...<br> and these girls, they got fame and wealth<br> and bright lights...<br> -but they ain`t got I`amour.<br> -You got I`amour, haven`t you?<br> -What`s going on now?<br> -Hana-ogi`s coming.<br> -Who?<br> -Hana-ogi. She`s the top, number one.<br> Come on.

Now you`re going<br> to see something.<br> Here comes Fumiko-san.<br> -Here comes Hana-ogi.<br> -l know it.<br> -You ain`t going to let me down.

You`re going to have to change....<br> Hana-ogi-san.<br> This is a great day for our house.<br> How do you do, Miss Ogi?<br> Where are you going?<br> l`ve got to help Katsumi with the....<br> lt looks as though everybody`s run off<br> and left us alone here.<br> lt certainly was nice of you<br> to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.<br> l was just tickled to death<br> when they told me you were coming over.<br> l`ll just sit down here.<br> Miss Ogi...<br> let me fix you a little drink.<br> To you.<br> That`s good.<br> Now, don`t tell me.<br> l know you`ve<br> got to slosh this around a little...<br> and get the dribble off,<br> and give it right back to you.<br> See, now you take that. Skoshi?<br> All right.<br> You know, l was surprised to find<br> they make that stuff out of rice.<br> We have rice back home in America.<br> Of course...<br> we just make rice pudding out of it.<br> We don`t drink it.<br> This is the first liquid rice l ever ran into.<br> Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,<br> that you`re a fine-looking woman?<br> l mean, real fine.<br> You`re even better looking<br> off the stage than you are on.<br> That`s true.<br> You get up there,<br> sing, dance, act, everything.<br> You`re all-around great.<br> l wonder, where did him and Katsumi....<br> l`m getting kind of hungry in here.<br> Look, Miss Ogi...<br> l`m not up too good<br> on Japanese ways of doing things...<br> and maybe l`m saying the wrong thing.<br> l mean, maybe my American manners<br> are embarrassing.<br> But l figure,<br> if you`ve come over here tonight...<br> maybe you were interested a little bit<br> in meeting me, too.<br> Now, maybe l`m wrong, but if l`m wrong...<br> then you`ve got to tell me.<br> Where do we go from here?<br> Because l don`t know what to say.<br> l`m running out of things to say.<br> My father was killed...<br> by American bomb dropped on my country.<br> You have been my enemy.<br> l have hated Americans.<br> l have thought they are savages.<br> There has been nothing but vengeance<br> in my heart.<br> There were an awful lot of Americans<br> that were killed, too.<br> l think it would be best<br> if we forgot about that.<br> You have been watching me on the bridge.<br> Watching me dance...<br> watching me as l go back to the dormitory.<br> But l have been watching you, too...<br> and you have not looked like a savage.<br> And when Katsumi-san told me<br> how gently you kissed her...<br> the day she became a bride...<br> how tenderly you kissed<br> my sweet little friend...<br> l realized the hate was of my own making.<br> That is why l came...<br> to ask you to forgive me...<br> for what l have been feeling.<br> Gruver-san, will you forgive me?<br> You make me feel like<br> an awful fool, Miss Ogi.<br> l really feel that l ought to...<br> ask you to forgive me<br> for some of the things that...<br> l`ve been thinking.<br> l come from the north of Japan.<br> And my father was a farmer...<br> and there were nine children.<br> And we were very poor.<br> There are too many people<br> in my crowded country.<br> l took the examination at Matsubayashi...<br> and now l am first dancer of all.<br> When l am too old to dance...<br> l will become head teacher.<br> My life is planned.<br> l am dedicated to Matsubayashi...<br> as you are dedicated<br> to American military life.<br> l have never been in love.<br> But l have dreamed...<br> and thought about it...<br> and waited.<br> The danger that lies ahead of us...<br> we must face now.<br> The danger of discovery, for both of us...<br> danger of weakness...<br> when it is over.<br> l will never fall in love again.<br> But l will love you, Ace-san...<br> if that is your desire.<br> Hello, how do you do?<br> Miss Webster.<br> Hello.<br> -Mr. Nakamura, how nice of you to come.<br> -lt is a great pleasure.<br> And may l say that you look<br> especially beautiful today?<br> Thank you. l haven`t seen<br> this month`s kabuki program.<br> l know. You see, l have been waiting.<br> Eileen.<br> -Mother, you remember Mr. Nakamura.<br> -How do you do, Mrs. Webster?<br> Yes, of course. Now listen, you two...<br> this party isn`t given especially for you.<br> You`ve got to circulate around...<br> and do more<br> to cement Japanese-American relations.<br> Mother, that`s exactly<br> what Mr. Nakamura and l are doing.<br> Nakamura-san,<br> my little girl wants your autograph.<br> -She admires you so.<br> -Of course.<br> -Will you please excuse me?<br> -Yes, of course.<br> Has Lloyd come yet?<br> Mother, how many weeks<br> are you going to keep on pretending?<br> Lloyd is not coming.<br> l`m absolutely furious at him.<br> How can he ignore the General`s invitation?<br> l had it delivered personally to his office.<br> l`m stuck with that Farrington woman.<br> Can you help me out?<br> There`s Crawford. Whenever he shows up,<br> there`s always something.<br> Can l speak to you alone<br> for a minute, General?<br> Major, do you have that list of the....<br> l want to see if the Williams were invited.<br> Yes, they have.<br> Waiter.<br> The reason l took it up with you personally<br> is because it concerns Maj. Gruver.<br> Now, we think he`s hooked on<br> to a Japanese dame--<br> Sorry, General, but this thing`s got me<br> all riled up.<br> Do you realize what it will mean<br> to the enlisted men in this area...<br> if they find out that their big hero,<br> Ace Gruver, is out--<br> l`ve known Major Gruver all his life.<br> l`m a close friend of his father`s.<br> l`m sure you must be wrong.<br> He was seen going into that house.<br> My men have been watching<br> a troublemaker named Kelly.<br> -He shacked up with another native girl--<br> -``Shacked up,`` Colonel?<br> Kelly`s married to a Japanese girl.<br> Maj. Gruver was the best man.<br> Seems quite natural to me<br> that he`d visit them.<br> How am l going to handle the situation?<br> Don`t handle it.<br> l trust Major Gruver implicitly.<br> General, is it all right with you<br> if l post an order...<br> to keep these officers from being seen...<br> with indigenous personnel?<br> Then if they are seen,<br> there`s something we can do about it.<br> All right.<br> Lloyd.<br> Look at you, Hana.<br> No one saw you come?<br> No, there`s no military personnel<br> around here...<br> except me.<br> -We must go to the tea ceremony.<br> -Yeah, l know.<br> Good afternoon.<br> This getting up and down`s likely to kill me.<br> You make such a production of everything.<br> The pleasure does not lie in the end itself.<br> lt`s the pleasure of all steps to that end.<br> l see.<br> -That you, Ace?<br> -Yeah, Kelly.<br> Come on in here.<br> l can`t right now.<br> He`d be surprised you come in this way.<br> He`d faint.<br> Just a little lower, Katsumi.<br> You always seem to be a little above it.<br> Yeah, that`s it.<br> -Kelly-san, now you get in tub?<br> -Okay, all right.<br> ls Hana-ogi coming over tonight?<br> Yeah, if she can get away.<br> We`re going to cook up<br> some fine St. Louis goulash...<br> with a little Memphis greens in there.<br> What are you doing tonight after dinner,<br> when Hana-ogi goes back to the theater?<br> Nothing.<br> How about playing poker<br> with Katsumi and me?<br> l`ll be delighted<br> to take your money and your pants.<br> This is the life, ain`t it, Ace?<br> There you are.<br> How do you do?<br> Listen, l got one word for you.<br> -What is that?<br> -Food.<br> Sayonara<br> Japanese goodbye<br> Whisper sayonara<br> Lover, don`t you cry<br> No more we stop to see<br> pretty cherry bIossom<br> No more we beneath the tree<br> Iooking at the sky<br> Sayonara<br> Sayonara<br> Goodbye<br> That`s the cutest thing l ever saw, honey.<br> l must go.<br> Good eating.<br> Are you going back<br> to the officer`s quarters tonight?<br> No, l think l`m going to just<br> fool around here.<br> What will you do all evening?<br> What am l going to do?<br> l`m going to get some beer...<br> some pretzels, some girls up here...<br> and have a little fun, for a change.<br> Good.<br> l don`t like you to be lonely.<br> Take care.<br> Come on in, Katsumi.<br> l`m sorry, Lloyd, l had to come.<br> lt`s important.<br> Hello, Eileen.<br> How are you?<br> Listen, sit down, will you?<br> l`m taking this stuff out of there,<br> just getting a little....<br> Go on, sit down here.<br> How are you?<br> -They`re after you, Lloyd.<br> -Who`s after me?<br> There`s a colonel. His name`s Crawford.<br> l know him.<br> He`s the one who`s riding Kelly.<br> This is Kelly`s house.<br> Yes, l know.<br> -You want to hear this, don`t you, Lloyd?<br> -Sure, l want to. Of course l do.<br> l overheard Colonel Crawford say<br> that he`s been having this house watched...<br> hoping to catch Kelly<br> at something irregular, l suppose.<br> Anyhow, that`s how l knew where it was.<br> Then they....<br> -They see me coming in and out of here.<br> -Yes.<br> l just felt that l had to tell you.<br> -There`s something that l feel that--<br> -l must go, Lloyd.<br> l just wanted to warn you<br> to be particularly careful about....<br> About what, honey?<br> About sticking strictly<br> to military regulations.<br> Lloyd, they`ll do anything<br> to hang something on you...<br> to keep you in line.<br> After all,<br> you`re the Air Force`s pinup boy, you know.<br> Colonel Crawford sounded<br> as if he was after blood.<br> More than anything else l could--<br> l must go now, Lloyd. Good luck.<br> Wait a minute, let me help put that on.<br> -Eileen, l know--<br> -Lloyd.<br> Lloyd, you`ve really thought seriously<br> about what you`re doing, haven`t you?<br> l think l have.<br> l hope so.<br> You have a brilliant record in the Air Force.<br> More people depend upon you<br> than you`ll ever know.<br> Before you throw all that<br> you`ve worked for away, Lloyd, be sure.<br> Please, be sure.<br> l don`t think if l had a million years<br> l could tell you how all this happened.<br> l`d better go before l lose all my charm.<br> Do you like this old, curious play?<br> Yeah, l`m beginning to get a kick out of it.<br> See that rope between the rocks?<br> That is a Shinto sign<br> showing they are married.<br> -What, the rocks?<br> -Yes.<br> They`ve been together so long...<br> our people thought<br> it was time they should get married.<br> They look well together, don`t you think?<br> Yeah, they make<br> a handsome-looking couple.<br> Do you like my country?<br> Were all these funny things here before,<br> when l came to Japan?<br> Yes.<br> Hello.<br> Hello there, Double Ugly. How are you?<br> To what do we owe the honor of this visit?<br> Laundry. Gonna put down the dirties<br> and pick up the cleans.<br> l hope you know what you`re doing.<br> This came in the office this morning.<br> Thought you`d like to see it.<br> ``This is a routine reminder<br> of the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe.``<br> Quote: ``Any public display,<br> whatever, of affection...<br> ``for a Japanese national<br> by a member of this command is forbidden.<br> ``Officers should not even appear<br> on public streets...<br> ``accompanied by<br> indigenous female personnel.`` Unquote.<br> Hooray for Christmas.<br> Come on, Ace, this is serious.<br> Everybody got one of these.<br> Listen, fool, Hana-ogi and l<br> are just as careful as we can be.<br> We never go anyplace where we`re gonna<br> be seen by anybody that matters.<br> We don`t even walk down the same street.<br> We just go out in the country<br> and fool around.<br> You never been to the country around here,<br> have you?<br> Awful pretty country around here. l mean it.<br> You know what l saw yesterday?<br> l saw two rocks that just got married.<br> You what?<br> l saw two rocks that got married.<br> And they looked very happy together, too.<br> l`ll bet they did.<br> They did.<br> lf you gonna be smart,<br> l`ll tell you what you do.<br> You get your little shoes shined,<br> you go out tonight...<br> because tonight is gonna be Tanabata.<br> Okay, what`s Tanabata?<br> You`re gonna sit<br> with your bare face hanging out...<br> and tell me you don`t know<br> what Tanabata is?<br> My word, boy.<br> l`m ashamed of you. l thought everybody<br> knew what Tanabata was.<br> Tanabata is the night of love.<br> You told me all about it one time.<br> You were telling me about Harry Truman...<br> and New York Yankees and sex...<br> and New York Yankees and Harry Truman<br> and sex.<br> l`ll see you.<br> Sex!<br> What have l done<br> to deserve such happiness?<br> l have seen this night of Tanabata<br> come and go many times...<br> but never before<br> have l understood what it meant.<br> Tanabata.<br> My heart is so full of love for you.<br> -Miss Webster?<br> -Yes?<br> Nakamura-san gets your note.<br> -Here is reply.<br> -Thank you.<br> He wishes if you will have dinner<br> with him and his guests.<br> Thank you very much.<br> They have a rather pleasant garden here,<br> Miss Webster.<br> Would you like to see it?<br> Yes, l think l would.<br> How beautiful.<br> What are you really afraid of, Miss Webster?<br> You don`t think it would enter<br> Major Gruver`s mind...<br> to marry a Japanese girl?<br> l don`t know.<br> Then permit me to reassure you.<br> l think Major Gruver is brave.<br> But not brave enough to face the censure...<br> that would result from such a marriage.<br> As for our famous, honored Hana-ogi...<br> there are many Japanese...<br> most of them, in fact...<br> who look upon marriage to an Occidental<br> with as much distaste...<br> as your people do to one of us.<br> l do not feel that way.<br> But then, l have had the privilege<br> of traveling in your country...<br> and knowing some great people there.<br> And l am especially conscious<br> at this moment...<br> that beauty is not confined to any one race.<br> Do not turn away, Miss Webster.<br> l am not...<br> necessarily making love to you.<br> l am only stating a very...<br> obvious fact.<br> May l see you again, Miss Webster...<br> and acquaint you with more Japan?<br> Of course.<br> l need to know more, much more...<br> about everything.<br> There she is.<br> Hello, honey.<br> Are you tired?<br> No, l just been lying here...<br> thinking about myself.<br> You know, l can`t believe l`m really here.<br> lt`s hard to believe that....<br> You know, it`s hard to believe<br> me being the same Lloyd Gruver...<br> that came over from Korea<br> just a little bit ago.<br> You know, l been thinking...<br> that all my life...<br> l been so busy...<br> snapping to, and giving orders,<br> and taking orders...<br> and being a general`s son<br> and doing the job...<br> and all that,<br> l just never took time to sit right down...<br> and you know,<br> think about what my reason for living is.<br> And l been spending<br> some afternoons here just...<br> being peaceful...<br> and easy and thinking.<br> And l believe for the first time...<br> l`m just beginning to understand...<br> what it`s all about...<br> what l really am, what l really want.<br> lt`s a nice feeling.<br> Yeah, come on in.<br> Ace, excuse me. l hate to bother you.<br> l just got the news.<br> You got what news?<br> l`m getting shipped back.<br> -You being shipped back where?<br> -Stateside.<br> l`ve been reassigned to a new duty station.<br> -Did you tell Katsumi yet?<br> -No.<br> Don`t tell her,<br> because maybe we can work something out.<br> What reason did he give you for it?<br> No reason. l know what it is.<br> Every guy on that list<br> is married to a Japanese girl.<br> l`m sorry, Major.<br> There`s nothing you can do.<br> We`re sending Kelly to the States Thursday,<br> and that`s that.<br> What about his wife, Colonel?<br> She stays here.<br> He knew he couldn`t take her back with him<br> when he married her.<br> Didn`t you?<br> That`s right.<br> You`d be busting up his home then,<br> you know.<br> l`m not busting up anything.<br> l admit Kelly`s been a pain in my side<br> for quite a while now.<br> Could you tell me why l didn`t have<br> the privilege of extending his tour of duty?<br> Don`t ask me, Major.<br> There`re lots of reasons for these things.<br> Anyway, it is an order.<br> And there`s nothing you can do about it...<br> even if you are a four-star general`s son.<br> Would it make any difference<br> if l told you my wife`s going to have a baby?<br> That`s tough, l admit.<br> Colonel, under these circumstances,<br> don`t you think that you`d be able...<br> to postpone this for a little while?<br> Maybe l could be transferred back to Korea.<br> No, you`re going home.<br> All the boys on this list, going home.<br> Where is your home?<br> That house by the canal.<br> l mean your real home.<br> That house by the canal.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> l`ve taken all the insubordination from you<br> l intend to.<br> Now, you listen to me, wise guy...<br> that house by the canal is off-limits<br> from now on.<br> Whole street`s off-limits.<br> You want a court-martial?<br> That mean l could stay in Japan?<br> -Come on.<br> -You`re shipping out of here on Thursday.<br> And don`t you try to help him.<br> You remember that house by the canal<br> is off-limits to all personnel.<br> Would you tell me, Colonel, just exactly<br> what you mean by that last remark?<br> That`s all l`m prepared to say at the minute...<br> except, you watch your step.<br> l don`t know<br> what else to say to you, General.<br> l`ve known this boy a long time...<br> and if he has to go back without Katsumi,<br> he`s gonna be in trouble.<br> l mean, that`s about it. That`s it.<br> What about his wife?<br> -l don`t know.<br> -And the baby?<br> So the Army lets them get married...<br> and then forces them<br> to desert their wives and babies.<br> That`s not fair, Eileen.<br> A boy away from home<br> for the first time, lonesome...<br> often falls in love<br> with the first girl he touches.<br> ln most cases, with a girl from the streets.<br> lt`s up to the service in some measure<br> to be fathers and mothers to these boys...<br> and try to head off these marriages.<br> But after they`re married<br> why should they be sent home?<br> The man`s being transferred<br> to a new duty station with many others.<br> Now, don`t ask me the reasons<br> for changes of duty.<br> There are thousands of them.<br> Lloyd said most of the men on this list<br> are married to Japanese girls.<br> That can`t be just a coincidence.<br> Why not? lt could easily be.<br> There have been lots of marriages.<br> Frankly, with some of these men...<br> l think they might welcome the transfer.<br> Why is that, sir?<br> There have been unfortunate aftermaths<br> to many of these marriages.<br> Recriminations, regrets.<br> A boy gets married impulsively...<br> then feels caught, doesn`t know how<br> to get out of it or what to do.<br> A change of duty gives them both<br> a chance to think it over.<br> To cool off.<br> l don`t mean to imply that`s the reason<br> these men are being transferred, but....<br> The whole thing`s...<br> a messy business.<br> General Webster, there`s no regret<br> in the case of Kelly and Katsumi.<br> You can have my word on that.<br> Three officers came to me today<br> with identical requests for their men.<br> lt`s not our policy to interfere with decisions<br> made by immediate commanding officers.<br> The basic structure of the military service...<br> would collapse if we started<br> doing things like that.<br> Your father would understand that,<br> even if you don`t.<br> Are you going to ask me<br> to make an exception of Kelly...<br> when l`ve refused these other men?<br> l am going to ask you to do that, sir.<br> You made an exception of me<br> when you brought me from Korea.<br> l`m afraid it`s a hopeless situation, Lloyd.<br> That`s the end of Joe Kelly.<br> You told me yourself<br> that Kelly`s past record was against him.<br> l couldn`t even use that.<br> Why does this mean so much to you, Lloyd?<br> Kelly`s from my outfit, Mrs. Webster.<br> l was his best man.<br> And l`m planning to marry<br> a Japanese girl myself.<br> Come into the other room, Eileen.<br> This is something for your father to handle.<br> No, Mrs. Webster, l don`t think it`s anything<br> for anybody to handle.<br> l`m sorry, Eileen.<br> Mrs. Webster.<br> Good afternoon, all.<br> l don`t think l`ll ever love anyone again<br> as much as l love Lloyd.<br> But l`ll tell you something<br> that`s rather ironic.<br> l once asked Lloyd<br> if he ever felt like grabbing me...<br> and hauling me off to a shack somewhere.<br> That`s just what he`s done, isn`t it?<br> Only it`s with somebody else.<br> Don`t go out, Eileen.<br> Stay and talk.<br> l`m sorry, Mother.<br> There`s only one person<br> l`d like to talk to at the moment...<br> and oddly enough, he`s Japanese.<br> Ace, l`ve been waiting for you.<br> Kelly, listen.<br> l just came from General Webster`s house...<br> -and there`s a whole big mess there.<br> -No good?<br> No. He didn`t go for it.<br> Matter of fact,<br> l think l even messed it up a little.<br> That figures.<br> -Did you tell Katsumi yet?<br> -No.<br> l`m chickening out fast.<br> Besides, she`s got her heart set<br> on something she planned for us tonight.<br> Wants us both to take the train to Osaka<br> and meet the girls at the puppet show.<br> Why spoil it?<br> Maybe l`ll tell her late tonight<br> when we`re alone.<br> Don`t give up on it.<br> l think there`s gonna be a way out of it.<br> -You think so?<br> -l do.<br> l don`t.<br> -l`ll see you, Ace.<br> -Hi, hon.<br> Tell Katsumi we`ll be there with bells.<br> Were you able to help?<br> -No. l wasn`t.<br> -How terrible.<br> l know this is hard, honey.<br> lt`s hard, but it`s not gonna last long.<br> The Army`s got to change that law next year<br> or the next one.<br> l mean, it just has to be. l`m sure of it.<br> As a matter of fact, l`m so sure of it<br> that l went downtown today...<br> and l signed some papers here...<br> that mean that you and l<br> are gonna get married.<br> -What`s the matter?<br> -We never spoke of marriage.<br> l know we didn`t, darling.<br> l know we didn`t.<br> l been going round and round with that...<br> every day for a long time.<br> And l didn`t feel l could speak about it<br> until now.<br> Now l can.<br> Of course, l won`t be able<br> to take you back to America...<br> but they`re bound to change<br> that ridiculous law soon.<br> And until then,<br> l`m gonna stay here with you.<br> l`m not stuck in the Air Force. l can resign.<br> Of course, l`m not trained<br> to do anything else...<br> but l`d find something.<br> We never spoke of marriage.<br> l know we didn`t, darling,<br> but we`re speaking of it now.<br> Do you remember the first night we talked?<br> l said there would be danger of weakness<br> when it is over.<br> Over? What are you talking about?<br> l am tempted.<br> With you, l could become a woman.<br> And a mother. And l could love you.<br> That`s right.<br> Do you think l haven`t thought about it?<br> Do you think l want<br> to become a lonely old woman...<br> who teaches dancing,<br> now that l have known you?<br> But it is no good.<br> You must know it, too.<br> No. l don`t know anything of the kind.<br> The way you talk about<br> leaving the Air Force...<br> finding some pitiful way of earning living...<br> -just to be here with your Japanese wife.<br> -Now, wait a minute.<br> l think we`re too far in this thing<br> to be talking like that.<br> Matsubayashi has been kind to me, Lloyd.<br> l am obligated to them.<br> No, you ain`t. You obligated to me.<br> They are my life.<br> l will bring shame to them, disgrace.<br> Lloyd, you know what l mean.<br> Yeah, l think l`m beginning<br> to know what you mean.<br> You mean you simply don`t love me enough<br> to go on through with it.<br> That`s what you mean, don`t you?<br> Why don`t you just come on out and say it?<br> lt is not what l mean.<br> l`m leaving for Tokyo in six days.<br> Matsubayashi is sending me.<br> You what?<br> With another troupe.<br> They have found out about us.<br> Any other girl, they would have dismissed,<br> but because they like me...<br> because they feel l am important to them,<br> they are being lenient.<br> l`m not gonna be lenient with you.<br> l want you to tell me now why Matsubayashi<br> means more to you than l do!<br> Lloyd, there`s something about myself...<br> l have not told you.<br> l have no right to marry anyone.<br> My father was very poor.<br> To save his other children...<br> he was forced to sell one of his daughters.<br> The man from the houses of Yoshiwara<br> came to him.<br> Because l was the oldest...<br> he agreed l should go with them.<br> Your father sold you?<br> Yes, but l was saved from starting this life...<br> by my best friend, Fumiko-san.<br> Her father paid money to free me...<br> and she brought me to Matsubayashi.<br> There, l not only earn my living...<br> l brought honor back to my family.<br> Matsubayashi has been kind to me.<br> They have trusted me.<br> l cannot leave them.<br> l cannot marry anyone.<br> Don`t you understand?<br> l don`t know.<br> l don`t know what to think.<br> l`ll kill you!<br> You ever do anything like this,<br> and l`ll kill you, understand?<br> -Get that straight, now! l`ll kill you.<br> -Wait a minute. Just take it easy, now.<br> Ace, look at this.<br> -lt fell out of her bag.<br> -What is it?<br> She was gonna have it done, too.<br> Tomorrow, by that quack doctor.<br> -What?<br> -For $8 she slashes her eyelids...<br> and sews them back up again.<br> Lots of these stupid little jerks have it done.<br> She was gonna surprise me.<br> Then l have good eyes. l fool everybody.<br> l look American, like Joe.<br> Will you tell that stupid dame<br> l love her the way she is?<br> l don`t want her changed!<br> Will you tell her l love her mouth<br> and her nose and her ears and her eyes...<br> just the way they are?<br> Tell her if she ever does<br> anything like that, l`ll....<br> -Wait a minute. Hold it.<br> -l want him be proud of me.<br> l`m sorry.<br> lf you want him to be proud of you,<br> you got to quit this stuff.<br> You want to be a good wife?<br> You`re making him unhappy doing that.<br> Tell him you`re sorry<br> and you won`t do it anymore.<br> Tell him that.<br> l so sorry.<br> Okay. Now we`re gonna<br> forget about that, all right?<br> l came over here tonight,<br> l thought we were gonna have a fish fry.<br> We were gonna have some fun,<br> dancing, yelling, and what do l find?<br> What`s gonna happen to us?<br> -Puppet show.<br> -Yeah, we had a surprise.<br> -You like?<br> -Sure, l do. Been looking forward to it.<br> -l know everybody tonight.<br> -Yeah.<br> We will be late.<br> Look...<br> the lover is leaving the city,<br> walk to the wood.<br> Don`t think of anything now.<br> Watch the play.<br> lt`s a tender story.<br> When gong sound, it is done.<br> And then she will bind her body.<br> -Bind her body?<br> -So that she won`t fall in an ugly position...<br> of dishonor when she dies.<br> -When she dies?<br> -Yes, shinju.<br> lt is custom for lovers...<br> to die together<br> when they can no longer face life.<br> lt is so beautiful.<br> Beautiful? They`re gonna die, aren`t they?<br> They will live in another world<br> on a beautiful lake...<br> floating always together...<br> like water lily.<br> Sure.<br> Kelly-san!<br> Something about soldiers<br> going through the house.<br> -That`s MPs boy.<br> -What happened? What`s wrong?<br> Get in the car.<br> -Go to Matsubayashi.<br> -Please tell me. l will not leave.<br> Get in the car. l`ll tell you later.<br> Matsubayashi.<br> Ed, look.<br> Look at that.<br> -You`re Maj. Gruver, aren`t you?<br> -That`s right.<br> Sorry, you`ll have to come with us.<br> Gen. Webster`s orders.<br> What right do you have<br> to board up his house?<br> He won`t be needing it anymore.<br> He`s shipping out Thursday.<br> Come on, Major.<br> You`ll hear from me, Kelly.<br> Come on, kid.<br> We`ll get in through the garden.<br> l got something to tell you.<br> You were seen in public with her tonight,<br> violating the orders of the area.<br> This has given me the right<br> to put you under arrest.<br> And, for your own sake,<br> l think l`d better do it.<br> You have anything to say?<br> Just as soon l`m out of this,<br> l`m going to be married...<br> and have a house of my own.<br> l`m afraid not.<br> l`m sorry, Lloyd, but it`s all settled.<br> The supervisor of the Matsubayashi<br> came to see me tonight.<br> The girl goes to Tokyo and you fly<br> to Randolph Field, day after tomorrow.<br> Here are your orders.<br> Until that time, you`re under house arrest.<br> You`re not to leave your quarters<br> until further notice.<br> l`m doing this because l feel<br> you`re not responsible at the moment.<br> After all, l`ve known your father for years.<br> Well, that`s all.<br> Did you see her?<br> No. l couldn`t even get near.<br> They`ve clamped down.<br> At the stage door<br> l couldn`t even see Fumiko-san.<br> l`ve got to see her.<br> l`m being shipped out of here tomorrow.<br> -Maj. Gruver?<br> -What is it?<br> -Would you do something for us?<br> -What do you want?<br> Airman Kelly`s disappeared.<br> No, that`s impossible.<br> l was with him just last night.<br> We know. He was scheduled to fly out<br> in a couple days...<br> but a special plane came,<br> and Col. Crawford told us to get him on it.<br> l took him to the airport at 1 2:50.<br> When the plane took off, Kelly wasn`t on it.<br> Figured you might know where he is.<br> How should l know?<br> His house has been boarded up, hasn`t it?<br> We know. Neighbors won`t talk to us.<br> We figure maybe they`re hiding him.<br> They`ll talk with you, Major.<br> Would you help us?<br> Would you give me one good reason<br> why l should?<br> We figured we`d give him a break.<br> We haven`t reported him as yet.<br> We could get him on another plane.<br> We might not have to turn him in<br> for desertion.<br> -Desertion?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -l`ll go with you in a minute.<br> -Major?<br> The neighbors won`t talk if they see an MP.<br> -l`ll go with him.<br> -Thank you, sir.<br> Kelly, Gruver out here.<br> l think he`s in there.<br> l`m going on in.<br> You in there?<br> Oh, my God!<br> l`ll call the police, Ace.<br> Oh, God!<br> Go home!<br> Ace, there`s no police around.<br> We`d better get out of here.<br> Look.<br> Doesn`t look too good, boy.<br> Come on, take it easy.<br> We`re getting help, Ace.<br> -You okay, boy?<br> -Yeah, l`m fine. You all right?<br> Yeah.<br> Listen, l`m going to....<br> l want you to take care of everything.<br> Will you?<br> -Yeah, l`ll get it.<br> -Okay. l`ll see you later.<br> -Where`s Hana-ogi?<br> -Hana-ogi`s not here.<br> -l know she`s here.<br> -She is on her way Tokyo.<br> She wasn`t supposed to go to Tokyo<br> till next week.<br> -She went today.<br> -l don`t believe you.<br> -Where`s Hana-ogi?<br> -She`s gone.<br> -Where`s her room?<br> -She`s gone.<br> Listen, where`s her room?<br> Come here.<br> Hana-ogi really gone, Major.<br> l don`t believe you.<br> l give you my word.<br> You go now, too, Major.<br> lt`s over.<br> Listen, leave me alone a minute, will you?<br> The hoodlums who attacked you<br> weren`t all your Japanese neighbors.<br> Most were professional troublemakers<br> sent to your street...<br> to create an incident, specifically with you.<br> lf you`re important to those who hate us...<br> don`t you see how important you are to us?<br> Do you understand any of this, Lloyd?<br> l know how you feel.<br> lt was dreadful about your friend Kelly...<br> and his wife.<br> Must be hard to take.<br> l hate to tell you something else,<br> because it`s...<br> almost too grotesque...<br> almost unforgivable in your eyes, l imagine.<br> l got word today...<br> that there`s a law being passed<br> in a month or two...<br> that will make it possible<br> for men like Kelly...<br> to take their Japanese brides<br> back to the States.<br> -That can`t be true, General.<br> -lt happens to be true, Lloyd.<br> Listen...<br> how do you get the guts to come here<br> and tell me that?<br> lt takes time to get laws passed, Lloyd.<br> People have died in this world needlessly,<br> waiting for them.<br> lt`s harder to take<br> when it hits you personally.<br> You`re lost. You`re confused.<br> Don`t you think it`s time you got back<br> to the main stream of your life?<br> Back to your roots?<br> What you were born for, and raised for?<br> You`ll feel better when you get back home,<br> back to your work.<br> Appreciate you coming over, General.<br> Take me to the airport, Mike.<br> That must be him.<br> Would you hold it so we can get a picture?<br> -Where would you like me? Right here?<br> -What about there? Yeah.<br> Smile, please.<br> lsn`t that Ace Gruver?<br> Looks like him.<br> Sir?<br> Excuse me, aren`t you Maj. Gruver?<br> Ace Gruver?<br> -Yes, that`s right.<br> -We`re from Stars and Stripes.<br> What are you doing in Tokyo?<br> l`m just passing through, boys.<br> -Just seeing the sights?<br> -That`s right.<br> Listen, l`m in a hurry.<br> You mind if l excuse myself?<br> -You`re excused.<br> -Sorry.<br> Hello, Hana-ogi.<br> l`m going back to America on Friday...<br> and l probably won`t...<br> get back in Japan again.<br> And before l go, there was just...<br> one thing l wanted to know.<br> You remember one time you said to me...<br> that you could love me...<br> and be a wife, and a mother?<br> l remember.<br> You said that since you`d known me,<br> you`d been afraid...<br> of being a lonely old woman,<br> teaching dancing.<br> Remember that?<br> l remember.<br> Did you mean that<br> when you said it, Hana-ogi?<br> l meant it.<br> lt is already happening.<br> Love has gone out of my work, out of me.<br> Lloyd, please go now.<br> This will only bring pain and trouble.<br> You and l are going to have more trouble...<br> than we thought of having in our lives...<br> unless you`re absolutely honest<br> with yourself.<br> Please, Lloyd, can`t we talk about this later?<br> There isn`t going to be any later.<br> There`s only going to be right now.<br> Excuse me, Mother.<br> -l must return this robe.<br> -Listen to me.<br> l want to know.<br> Do you love me, or don`t you?<br> Because if you don`t...<br> then l`m going to have to find a way<br> to live with it.<br> -And if you do, then--<br> -Please, Lloyd.<br> Wait a minute.<br> l don`t want you to tell me anything more...<br> or anything less than you feel<br> in the very deepest part of you...<br> because what you answer to me now<br> is going to affect us for the rest of our lives.<br> Do you love me, Hana-ogi,<br> or don`t you love me?<br> l`m so frightened and confused.<br> l cannot think.<br> -l cannot even understand your thinking.<br> -l`m not thinking!<br> For the first time in my life,<br> l`m not thinking, and l don`t care.<br> -But, Lloyd, we must do the right thing.<br> -What are you talking about, the right thing?<br> We`ve been wasting two good lives<br> trying to do the right thing...<br> the right thing for Matsubayashi,<br> the right thing for my father...<br> the right thing for the military,<br> the right thing for Japanese tradition...<br> the right thing for the great white race.<br> -But we have duties and obligations.<br> -That`s right, we do!<br> We have duties and obligations...<br> and the first obligation we have<br> is to love each other...<br> to become man and wife,<br> and raise some clean, sweet children...<br> and give them the very best<br> that we know how.<br> And if we don`t meet that obligation,<br> we ain`t going to be any good to anybody.<br> We live in different worlds,<br> come from different races.<br> Honey, l want you to be my wife.<br> But what would happen to our children?<br> What would they be?<br> What would they be?<br> They`d be half Japanese, half American.<br> They`d be half yellow and half white.<br> They`d be half you, they`d be half me.<br> That`s all they`re going to be.<br> Hana-ogi, l want you to come with me now.<br> l want you to come with me now,<br> down to the American consulate...<br> here in Tokyo.<br> We`ll start filling out those papers,<br> `cause we`ve only got a few days...<br> to get this whole thing done,<br> get it out of the way.<br> Will you come?<br> l`m going to wait for you outside.<br> Did l tell you he`d be here?<br> Look at this crowd!<br> Look who`s here, our rivals.<br> -What do you know?<br> -You guys heard about it, too.<br> No secrets. No secrets in this country!<br> Hello, Major. What a coincidence!<br> You got a story for us, sir?<br> No. As a matter of fact, l don`t.<br> Major, you`re not going<br> to try to deny it, are you?<br> -Deny what?<br> -The story.<br> Why won`t you give us a story?<br> You`re big news now, sir.<br> l`m afraid l don`t know<br> what you`re talking about.<br> Here`s Hana-ogi. Maybe she`ll talk.<br> Come on, Hana-ogi, that`s not fair.<br> What did you say?<br> lt is very difficult for Japanese woman<br> to speak in public.<br> l have never done so.<br> But perhaps now it is the time.<br> Maj. Gruver has asked me to be his wife.<br> He knows there are many people<br> in his country...<br> who will be disturbed by this.<br> l know my people will be shocked, too.<br> But l hope they will learn to understand...<br> and someday approve.<br> We are not afraid,<br> because we know this is right.<br> l hope l can continue as a dancer.<br> And l hope, when l`m old...<br> l will be able to teach children to dance.<br> My own children.<br> Major? The big brass are gonna<br> yell their heads off about this.<br> The Japanese aren`t going to like it either.<br> Have you got anything to say to them, sir?<br> Yeah.<br> Tell them we said ``sayonara.``<br>
