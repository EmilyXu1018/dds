Thank you.<br> Will he get better?<br> Already is, a little.<br> Will he race?<br> No. Not that one.<br> So why are you<br> fixing him?<br> 'Cause l can.<br> Every horse is good<br> for something.<br> He could be a cart horse<br> or a lead pony.<br> And he's still nice<br> to look at.<br> You don't...<br> You don't throw<br> a whole life away<br> just 'cause<br> he's banged up a little.<br> ls that coffee?<br> Yeah.<br> lt's bad, though.<br> You always tell the truth?<br> Yeah, l try to.<br> lt ain't just the speed.<br> lt's the heart.<br> And you want something<br> that's not afraid to compete.<br> Half these horses<br> are just show ponies.<br> You want something<br> that's not gonna run<br> from a fight.<br> How do you find that?<br> Look, l won the Robles<br> Handicap. l was second<br> in the Tijuana Derby.<br> l won the Manzanita Oaks.<br> You know, that used<br> to be a stakes race.<br> l know.<br> l would've won, T.J.,<br> but the piece of shit<br> lugged out on me.<br> Sounds great.<br> We'll let you know.<br> Look. l can work them out<br> in the morning.<br> Or even hot-walk them<br> if you need me to.<br> Really? You'll hot-walk them?<br> This is something else.<br> A dream come true,<br> walking you around.<br> Hook you up to a plow,<br> pull me around<br> for a little while. Come on.<br> You ever run in the money?<br> Hey. Hey.<br> You ever run in the money?<br> l don't think so.<br> Couldn't beat a human being,<br> let alone another horse.<br> You goddamn sack-of-crap<br> old plater. Probably the<br> fastest you're gonna run<br> in your entire life,<br> you piece-of-shit<br> old glue-pot.<br> That's right.<br> The first time<br> he saw Seabiscuit,<br> the colt was walking<br> through the fog<br> at 5:00 in the morning.<br> Smith would say later<br> that the horse looked<br> right through him,<br> as if to say,<br> "What the hell<br> are you looking at?<br> "Who do you think you are?"<br> He was a small horse,<br> barely 15 hands.<br> He was hurting, too.<br> There was a limp in his walk,<br> a wheezing when he breathed.<br> Smith didn't pay<br> attention to that.<br> He was looking the horse<br> in the eye.<br> God damn.<br> He was the son of Hard Tack,<br> sired by the mighty<br> Man o' War.<br> But the breeding<br> did little to impress<br> anyone at Claiborne Farms.<br> Get rid of him.<br> At six months,<br> he was shipped off to train<br> with the legendary trainer<br> "Sunny" Fitzsimmons,<br> who, over time,<br> developed a similar opinion<br> of the colt.<br> ls that a racehorse<br> or a lead pony?<br> The judgment wasn't helped<br> by his gentle nature.<br> Where his sire<br> had been a fierce,<br> almost violent competitor,<br> Seabiscuit took to sleeping<br> for huge chunks of the day<br> and enjoyed lolling for hours<br> under the boughs<br> of the juniper trees.<br> His other great talent<br> was eating.<br> Though half the size<br> of other colts,<br> Seabiscuit could frequently<br> eat twice as much.<br> Fitzsimmons decided<br> the horse was lazy<br> and felt sure he could train<br> the obstinance out of him.<br> l want you to hit him<br> as many times as you can<br> over a quarter of a mile.<br> When he didn't improve,<br> they decided<br> the colt was incorrigible.<br> They made him<br> a training partner<br> to better horses,<br> forcing him to lose<br> head-to-head duels<br> to boost the confidence<br> of the other animal.<br> By the time<br> he was three years old,<br> Seabiscuit was struggling<br> in two cheap claiming<br> races a week.<br> Soon he grew as bitter<br> and angry as his sire<br> Hard Tack had been.<br> He was sold<br> for the rock-bottom price<br> of $2,000.<br> And, of course,<br> it all made sense.<br> Champions were large,<br> they were sleek,<br> they were<br> without imperfection.<br> When they finally did<br> race him, he did just what<br> they had trained him to do.<br> He lost.<br> What exactly is it<br> you like?<br> He's got spirit.<br> l'll say.<br> Can...<br> Can he be ridden?<br> Oh, sure.<br> Eventually.<br> He can be a little touchy.<br> Yeah, l got it.<br> No. Really.<br> l'm fine.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> That horse is nuts!<br> Come on!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Let's go! Come on,<br> you sons of bitches!<br> Let's go! Come on!<br> Let's go! Come on,<br> you sons of bitches!<br> l'll take all of you!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> lt's okay.<br> l'm not afraid of you.<br> Sure. l know.<br> l know what you're all about.<br> You hungry?<br> Huh?<br> Yeah. Bet you are.<br> Come on. Come on, boy.<br> Yeah.<br> Why don't you just<br> breeze him around<br> one turn.<br> Give the folks a look.<br> Great.<br> Red Pollard,<br> Mr. and Mrs. Howard.<br> Yeah. Hi.<br> Hello.<br> Well, we'll just be<br> moving on.<br> Does he breeze?<br> Well, we'll find out.<br> Seems pretty fast.<br> Yeah. ln every direction.<br> Hell, he's so beat-up,<br> it's hard to tell<br> what he's like.<br> l just can't help<br> feeling they got him<br> so screwed up<br> running in a circle,<br> he's forgotten<br> what he was born to do.<br> He just needs to learn<br> how to be a horse again.<br> Well, how do you do that?<br> How far do you want<br> me to take him?<br> Till he stops.<br> Okay.<br> That seems like<br> a pretty good ride.<br> Hope so.<br> That's it, boy.<br> You're all right.<br> Let's see what you got, boy.<br> Ha! Ha!<br> That's it, boy. That's it!<br> Yeah!<br> Well, at least<br> he wasn't expensive.<br> No. That's true.<br> God damn it!<br> You're an amazing animal!<br> You can come inside,<br> you know.<br> l'm fine. Thank you.<br> Yeah, you look it.<br> No, really, l'm fine.<br> Okay. Suit yourself.<br> Welcome.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> lt's okay.<br> Oh, l'm not that hungry.<br> Sure you're not.<br> lt's just a lot of food.<br> lt's okay.<br> We rather have you<br> strong than thin.<br> They called it "relief,"<br> but it was<br> a lot more than that.<br> lt had dozens of names:<br> NRA, WPA,<br> the CCC.<br> But it really came down<br> to just one thing.<br> For the first time<br> in a long time,<br> someone cared.<br> For the first time<br> in a long time,<br> you were no longer alone.<br> Goat racing?<br> Oh, no. Just trying to<br> calm him down a little.<br> Smart ones hate<br> being alone all the time.<br> Oh.<br> And sometimes another animal,<br> it just soothes them a bit.<br> Pretty quiet in there.<br> What'd you do?<br> Go take a look.<br> Okay. You don't break him<br> or anything, but we gotta see<br> what he's got.<br> You take him to<br> the five and a half pole<br> and turn him loose.<br> Turn him loose?<br> Yeah, son.<br> He's a racehorse.<br> Ha! Ha!<br> Come on!<br> Come on!<br> Come on! l know<br> you got more than this.<br> Let's show them, boy!<br> How's he look?<br> Asleep.<br> Come on! Let's show them,<br> Pops! Come on!<br> There it is! Yeah!<br> Oh, my goodness.<br> Yeah, you and me! Let's go!<br> Boy. Fast?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> How fast?<br> Your horse just broke<br> the track record at Tanforan.<br> Yep. Sometimes<br> they just hanker<br> for a little competition.<br> As long as we're talking<br> long shots, l got a real<br> doozy for you, folks.<br> Today we got a horse<br> that's going off at 70-to-1 ,<br> and that's a short price,<br> my friends.<br> This horse couldn't win<br> a church raffle, let alone<br> a $2,000 allowance.<br> Yeah, talk about a jump<br> in class. This is the skunk<br> at the garden party.<br> Yes, he's the surprise<br> in the punch bowl.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> l'll lay even money<br> that this nag, Seabiscuit,<br> couldn't even finish<br> six furlongs.<br> This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin<br> live at Clockers' Corner.<br> Wow.<br> l wanted maroon.<br> They only had bright red.<br> Oh, it looks great.<br> You don't think<br> the "H" is too big?<br> You seen the size<br> of our jockey?<br> Come on.<br> Okay. The favorite's<br> that gray over there.<br> He's got a big late charge,<br> so lock in early with him<br> and stay right off his flank.<br> Okay.<br> And once our boy sees<br> who the competition is,<br> he'll do most of the work.<br> But don't move<br> till that gray does.<br> What if it's late?<br> Let's go.<br> Twelve minutes to post.<br> l don't think<br> it's gonna matter much.<br> Honestly.<br> Horses come out on the track<br> for the sixth race.<br> $20,000...<br> Come on in.<br> Number 3,<br> Pollard on Seabiscuit.<br> Followed by...<br> Hey, sahib.<br> Kind of small, isn't he?<br> Gonna look a lot smaller<br> in a second, Georgie.<br> l got five bucks<br> says he doesn't.<br> Starter's poised.<br> The flag is up.<br> And away they go.<br> Pirate's Gold breaks first,<br> followed by Geronimo<br> on the outside.<br> Silver Treasure is third,<br> followed by Seabiscuit.<br> They're coming<br> by the five-furlong pole.<br> lt's Pirate's Gold, Geronimo,<br> Hill's Army and Agua Dulce.<br> Son of a bitch!<br> Ha! Ha!<br> Piece of shit bastard!<br> What the hell is he doing?<br> ...opening up<br> a three and a half...<br> A four-length lead.<br> Let's go!<br> What are you doing?<br> l'm gonna<br> put you on the rail,<br> you piece of shit!<br> Get off of me!<br> How do you like that,<br> you son of a bitch?<br> You're gonna drop me, man!<br> The two horses<br> are flying down...<br> You like the rail?<br> ...as they come<br> into the homestretch.<br> Here comes the cavalry charge!<br> Knock me<br> off my horse!<br> lt's Silver Treasure<br> on the inside<br> followed by Pirate's Gold.<br> Again they go, Pirate's Gold.<br> Silver Treasure on the inside.<br> Silver Treasure<br> and Pirate's Gold.<br> But at the wire it's<br> Silver Treasure, the winner<br> by two and a half lengths.<br> Damn it.<br> What the hell<br> were you thinking?<br> He fouled me.<br> What am l supposed to do,<br> let him get away with that?<br> Well, yeah,<br> when he's 40-to-1 .<br> He almost put me in the rail!<br> Well, did he?<br> Look, we had a plan.<br> He fouled me, Tom!<br> What am l supposed to do?<br> He cut me off!<br> He fouled me!<br> Son? Son.<br> What are you so mad at?<br> There's even<br> a phone next door.<br> Dad.<br> We'll call you.<br> Every couple of weeks,<br> we'll call you,<br> and we'll tell you<br> where we are.<br> No. We're just gonna<br> go home, all right?<br> You have a gift.<br> You have a gift.<br> l need to borrow some money.<br> All right.<br> l haven't been<br> to a dentist, and...<br> Well, l need to<br> borrow some money.<br> That's fine.<br> l don't know<br> when l can pay you back.<br> l mean, when we win.<br> When we win,<br> l can pay you back.<br> That is, if you<br> still want me to ride.<br> Of course l want you to ride.<br> How much do you need?<br> Ten dollars.<br> Here.<br> lt's fine.<br> Thank you.<br> l really appreciate it.<br> That's it, Pops.<br> We're okay now.<br> lt's all right, boy.<br> Yeah, we're okay.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> All the time in the world,<br> boy. That's it, Pops.<br> Nice and easy.<br> Just like that, boy.<br> Just like that.<br> What do you think, boy?<br> You ready to go?<br> You and me.<br> Let's go, boy. Let's go.<br> Ha! Ha!<br> ln the end,<br> it wasn't the dams<br> or the roads<br> or the bridges or the parks.<br> Or the tunnels<br> or the thousands of<br> other public projects<br> that were built<br> in those years.<br> lt was more invisible<br> than that.<br> Men who were broken<br> only a year before<br> suddenly felt restored.<br> Men who'd been shattered<br> suddenly found their voice.<br> Well, l just think this horse<br> has a lot of heart.<br> He may have been down,<br> but he wasn't out.<br> He may have lost a few,<br> but he didn't<br> let it get to him.<br> l think we could all learn<br> a lick or two<br> from this little guy.<br> Oh, and by the way,<br> he doesn't know he's little.<br> He thinks he's the<br> biggest horse out there.<br> So you got big plans<br> for this little horse?<br> Oh, yeah. See, sometimes<br> when the little guy,<br> he doesn't know<br> he's a little guy,<br> he can do great big things.<br> Can we get a shot here?<br> See, this isn't<br> the finish line.<br> The future is the finish line,<br> and the Biscuit<br> is just the horse<br> to get us there.<br> "Just<br> the horse to get us there."<br> You certainly made a believer<br> out of me, Mr. Howard.<br> lt's time for this old tout<br> to eat some crow.<br> Four and 20 blackbirds,<br> to be exact, all baked up<br> in some humble pie,<br> and l'll take mine a la mode.<br> Oh. And one more thing,<br> Mr. Howard.<br> l just wanna say...<br> Thanks for the champagne.<br> Don't mention it.<br> Did you see the infield?<br> No, not yet.<br> Take a look. Your little horse<br> is selling out<br> the cheap seats.<br> Oh, my gosh.<br> Hey, what do you think<br> about all those folks<br> in the infield, Red?<br> That's who we're riding for,<br> folks with a quarter<br> in their pocket.<br> Red! Red! Red!<br> Red!<br> That's an awful lot of hoopla<br> for such a little horse!<br> "Though he be but little,<br> he is fierce."<br> What's that? What?<br> That's Shakespeare, boys.<br> That's Shakespeare.<br> Oh, Shakespeare.<br> Holy cow.<br> Look at that, Biscuit.<br> Look at that.<br> There you go. Oh, my God.<br> There he is!<br> Seabiscuit! Yeah!<br> That's for you, Pops.<br> That's for you.<br> That makes<br> six consecutive victories<br> for this little colt<br> from nowhere,<br> one shy of the record.<br> Why, he may be the biggest<br> sensation on four legs<br> since Hope and Crosby.<br> Yes, it's standing room only<br> every time this pint-size pony<br> slips on a saddle,<br> and if you can't afford<br> the quarter,<br> a comfy tree limb<br> will catch you a glimpse.<br> So what is the secret<br> of this rags-to-riches story?<br> l have it on good authority<br> they feed Seabiscuit<br> two pints of ice-cold beer<br> before every race.<br> Reporting from trackside<br> in an equine exclusive...<br> Oh, my gosh!<br> This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin,<br> for Movietone News.<br> Who was that?<br> Morning.<br> Boy, what's this?<br> lt's beer.<br> From an admiring public.<br> lt's pretty good, too.<br> There's more in there.<br> Where's the horse?<br> Signing autographs.<br> He's what?<br> Yeah.<br> There you go, Max.<br> Let it dry for a minute<br> before you try to sell it.<br> Hey, Charles.<br> You think you can<br> break the record?<br> Oh, let's ask him.<br> Hey, Biscuit.<br> You gonna win one more?<br> You gonna break the record?<br> Hey, Charles.<br> What do you think finally<br> turned this horse around?<br> Well, l think we just<br> gave him a chance.<br> Sometimes all somebody needs<br> is a second chance.<br> l think there are a lot<br> of people out there know<br> just what l'm talking about.<br> You got that right.<br> Here, boys. Take some<br> horseshoes with you.<br> Right here, Charles.<br> Hey, thanks.<br> These are special.<br> Never run out of luck.<br> Yeah. Right.<br> There you go.<br> Sam! Where the hell<br> are my horseshoes?<br> You quit?<br> l can't work like this.<br> He's not a parade animal.<br> He's a racehorse.<br> Look, Tom, a little bit<br> of public relations...<br> l can't get him to be<br> a great horse if l can't get<br> the time to work with him.<br> What do you mean?<br> He is a great horse.<br> We don't know that yet.<br> He's won six stakes in a row.<br> Against who?<br> This.<br> This is a great horse.<br> First he smashed them<br> in the Kentucky Derby.<br> Then he crushed them<br> in the Preakness.<br> Then he destroyed all comers<br> in the Belmont<br> to snatch the Triple Crown.<br> At almost 18 hands,<br> he's as big as he is fast.<br> Eighteen hands?<br> They'd need two guys<br> to ride him.<br> Yeah, he's big.<br> Born of perfect breeding,<br> displaying perfect form,<br> boasting a perfect record,<br> the millionaire Mr. Riddle<br> may have finally created<br> the perfect horse.<br> Until next time,<br> this is Horace Halstedter<br> for Metrotone News.<br> What the hell does that mean,<br> anyway? Perfect. He's perfect.<br> What the hell does<br> "perfect" mean?<br> What?<br> You show me something<br> that's perfect, l'll show you<br> something that's not.<br> Look, he's obviously<br> the best horse in the East.<br> We're obviously<br> the best horse in the West.<br> l just think the country<br> deserves to see<br> which horse is better.<br> You may not be able to see it,<br> folks, but the gauntlet just<br> landed on my desk.<br> Are we talking about<br> a match race, Mr. Howard?<br> Whatever Mr. Riddle wants.<br> Match race, stakes race,<br> potato sack race.<br> Just 'cause we're littler<br> doesn't mean we're scared.<br> Right you are,<br> and out there in the<br> heartland of America,<br> every little guy knows<br> exactly what you mean.<br> You hear that, Mr. Riddle?<br> You have an appointment<br> with destiny, a date with...<br> Destiny.<br> Destiny. Yes, exactly.<br> So, destiny,<br> and his name is Seabiscuit.<br> Does Seabiscuit<br> stand a chance?<br> l'm glad they finally have<br> racing in California.<br> Do they use Western saddles<br> out there?<br> Look. Comparing these<br> two horses is ridiculous.<br> War Admiral<br> is a real racehorse<br> who's won every prestigious<br> race in America.<br> This little colt of theirs<br> is running out<br> on some cow track.<br> You know.<br> Yeah, if we responded<br> to every fledgling challenger<br> who wants to make<br> a name for themselves,<br> it wouldn't be fair to us.<br> But it wouldn't be fair<br> to them, either.<br> You wouldn't put<br> Jack Dempsey in the ring<br> with a middleweight.<br> Would you?<br> "Middleweight"?<br> l'll kill him.<br> l'll knock his<br> goddamn block off!<br> He's chicken!<br> l know. l know.<br> "Middleweight"? l mean...<br> We just have to<br> flush him out a little.<br> How?<br> Well, this is still<br> America. Right?<br> Yeah.<br> Cash.<br> $100,000?<br> The biggest purse<br> in American history.<br> l sure hope so.<br> You'd get every top<br> Eastern thoroughbred.<br> All of them.<br> You'd put this place<br> on the map.<br> They might have all that blue<br> blood crap. Our money is just<br> as good as theirs.<br> Charlie...<br> Doc, this is our moment.<br> Now, they're stuck<br> in the past.<br> This is the future.<br> Great.<br> Come here.<br> What?<br> Come here.<br> What?<br> Come on. Don't you<br> wanna see them piling off<br> of those train cars,<br> coming out here to your track?<br> Huh? That's victory<br> in itself, Doc.<br> That's the finish line<br> right there.<br> You sell cars like this?<br> Hundreds of them.<br> Hold your horses!<br> Hold your horses!<br> Just when you thought<br> you'd seen it all,<br> Doc Strub has gone<br> and raided the cookie jar.<br> Yes, he has smashed<br> the piggy bank and sold<br> the family silver.<br> $100,000 for one horse race?<br> Makes me want to walk around<br> on all fours and throw<br> a saddle on my back.<br> Will the Biscuit be the<br> favorite? Not likely, folks.<br> We're about to be invaded.<br> We're talking Derby winners,<br> Preakness winners,<br> Belmont winners.<br> Hold on, hold on.<br> l guess that's all one horse.<br> But at 100,000 bucks,<br> how can the Admiral<br> not want to dock his ship<br> in this friendly port?<br> This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin<br> live from Clockers' Corner.<br> They raised<br> the hundred grand!<br> Yeah, how about that<br> Hundred Grander?<br> No, thanks.<br> Excuse me, boys.<br> Shit!<br> Charles.<br> Shit.<br> Yeah, l know what you mean.<br> The hell with it.<br> We'll run him anyway.<br> There are still gonna be<br> the greatest horses<br> in the world,<br> and if we win this thing,<br> they're gonna have to face us.<br> He's gonna have to face us.<br> Okay. Special Agent's<br> pure speed.<br> He's gonna go to the lead,<br> but he can't handle<br> the distance.<br> So don't get sucked in.<br> l won't.<br> lndian Broom<br> could be there, too.<br> We'll know<br> they're holding him back<br> if they use the ring bit.<br> Now, the one to worry about<br> is Rosemont.<br> He closes<br> like a freight train,<br> and he'll fight you<br> for it at the end.<br> You gotta have some momentum<br> built up by the time<br> he makes his move.<br> lt's still kind of soggy<br> out there from the other day,<br> so try to stay off the rail<br> where it's deep.<br> l figured l'd sit back<br> about three wide.<br> Yeah, that's fine.<br> And other than that, just...<br> Just try to feel it.<br> He'll tell you<br> when he's ready.<br> Yeah, boy!<br> Red, come on, Red!<br> Yeah, come on. Go! Go!<br> Watch him, Red. Watch him.<br> Come on! Come on!<br> lt's not my fault.<br> Not this time.<br> l told you<br> look out for Rosemont.<br> l thought l had it.<br> You stopped riding!<br> l couldn't see him!<br> What the hell<br> are you talking about?<br> He was flying up your tail!<br> Yeah, well, l can't...<br> What?<br> See out there!<br> He lied to us.<br> What?<br> He lied to us.<br> You want a jockey<br> who lies to us?<br> What do you mean?<br> He can't see.<br> He's blind in one eye.<br> lt's fine, Tom.<br> lt's fine?<br> Yeah, it's fine.<br> You don't throw a whole life<br> away just 'cause it's<br> banged up a little bit.<br> Good night.<br> All right, all right.<br> Hold it.<br> Well, l guess that little<br> horse of theirs<br> turned out to be<br> a glorified claimer after all.<br> At least we don't have to deal<br> with this David and Goliath<br> nonsense anymore.<br> You can say that again.<br> All right, boys.<br> Let me through.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Mr. Riddle...<br> The hell with it.<br> Just a couple<br> of announcements.<br> First, Red Pollard will remain<br> Seabiscuit's jockey,<br> now and forever.<br> Second, if they're too scared<br> to come and race us,<br> we're gonna go find them.<br> We're gonna enter every race<br> where War Admiral<br> is on the card,<br> and if he scratches,<br> which he probably will,<br> we'll enter the next race<br> he's on the card.<br> And we won't come home<br> until we've faced him,<br> win, lose or draw.<br> You know,<br> l'd rather have<br> one horse like this<br> than 100 War Admirals.<br> Thanks, fellas.<br> Mr. Howard!<br> Gotta see him!<br> Come on!<br> Look, l really don't know<br> what to say. We appreciate it.<br> l'm sure the Biscuit<br> appreciates it, too.<br> He's just a little shy<br> about speaking in public.<br> He'd thank you himself.<br> l guess you all are here today<br> because this is a horse<br> who won't give up.<br> That's right.<br> Even when life beats him<br> by a nose.<br> That's right!<br> Yeah.<br> Ain't that the truth.<br> But, heck,<br> everybody loses a couple.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And you either pack up<br> and you go home,<br> or you keep fighting!<br> lsn't that right?<br> Yeah!<br> That's right!<br> That's right.<br> Now,<br> do you want to see<br> a match race?<br> Yeah!<br> You do?<br> Yeah!<br> You wanna see this young fella<br> ride that horse?<br> Yeah!<br> Yes!<br> Seabiscuit!<br> Extra! Extra!<br> Biscuit on the warpath!<br> Will there be a match race?<br> lt's all right here.<br> Extra! Extra!<br> Biscuit on the warpath!<br> l don't know<br> what they're so worried about.<br> l mean, look at us.<br> Our horse is too small.<br> Our jockey's too big.<br> Our trainer is too old.<br> Forgive me, Tom.<br> And l'm too dumb<br> to know the difference!<br> Yeah, Charlie!<br> You'd think<br> they'd want to race us<br> instead of running away!<br> Yeah!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> l am staring at a swarm<br> of humanity,<br> a sea of hungry faces<br> demanding the match<br> of a lifetime.<br> They have come here tonight<br> in the cold, in the wind,<br> in the chill of a late<br> October night.<br> Let me just make my way<br> over to one of them<br> so you can hear it<br> for yourself.<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> l'm sorry. Excuse me.<br> Ma'am, ma'am, if l may.<br> What brings you<br> out here tonight with your<br> three small children<br> clamoring for a view<br> of this little horse?<br> Because we want to see<br> a match race!<br> l said, don't you think<br> Mr. Riddle<br> owes this country a...<br> Match race! Match race!<br> Match race!<br> Match race! Match race!<br> Match race!<br> Fine, but it's on my terms.<br> Any terms you want.<br> Mile and three sixteenths.<br> l won't accept anything else.<br> All right.<br> Want a walk-up<br> start with a bell.<br> We won't be using<br> any contraptions.<br> You mean a starting gate?<br> Fine.<br> And we run it here,<br> at our home track.<br> That's not negotiable.<br> Seems like a<br> nice enough place.<br> Oh, l'm sure you'll find it<br> quite comfortable, Mr. Howard.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> l wanna be a horse.<br> Well, you're<br> almost big enough.<br> That's very funny.<br> lt doesn't even<br> smell like a barn.<br> They probably<br> deodorize it every morning.<br> Well,<br> they still crap.<br> Well, they do. They do.<br> Over here, pal.<br> Right over here!<br> There you go!<br> This way. This way.<br> Take a good shot of that.<br> Biscuit, here...<br> Whoa! What's that thing?<br> They got us<br> in the servants' quarters.<br> ls that him?<br> No.<br> Bit too small.<br> That's him.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Maybe he's the kind of horse<br> that just looks good<br> in the paddock.<br> Wow.<br> We gotta get to the lead.<br> Biscuit never goes<br> to the lead.<br> l know,<br> but we gotta teach him<br> to break first.<br> lf that monster shakes loose,<br> we'll never catch him.<br> What, retrain him?<br> We got two weeks.<br> Excuse me.<br> We'd like to buy your bell.<br> He didn't tell me<br> you were coming.<br> Oh, probably<br> just an oversight.<br> Do you want me<br> to turn on some lights<br> or something?<br> No.<br> No.<br> No?<br> Okay. lt's<br> a predatory response.<br> lf l just brush it past<br> his flank, he'll bolt.<br> And we just want to teach him<br> to do it with the bell.<br> How far do you want me<br> to take him?<br> To a hundred feet.<br> Just so he learns<br> to break first.<br> Okay. Got it.<br> You ready?<br> Ready.<br> All right. Here we go.<br> Oh, come on, Tom!<br> When you gonna work<br> that horse out?<br> When he wakes up, l guess.<br> Geez!<br> For crying out loud.<br> The whole track?<br> l just want him to do it once<br> with nothing in front of him.<br> Yeah, but l can't see<br> out there.<br> That's all right. He can.<br> Come on, Tom. Tom, please.<br> Why do you always<br> have to do this? Shit.<br> Oh, great.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Wow.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Tim.<br> Hey.<br> Pumpkin. Hey.<br> How you doing, Pumpkin?<br> Are you shy?<br> Hey, Red?<br> Oh, my gosh.<br> Yeah. Guess l should have<br> used you as a jockey<br> instead of a groom.<br> No, no. lt was...<br> That was great.<br> Look, l'm in a little trouble.<br> l got this horse over<br> in Annex, and l been trying<br> to sell a share of him.<br> Tough times and all?<br> l was wondering if maybe<br> you'd breeze him for me.<br> lf folks saw Red Pollard...<br> Yeah. l'll breeze<br> your horse for you.<br> lt's on.<br> Good.<br> Just take him<br> for five furlongs<br> at around a minute one.<br> Can he do that?<br> Should.<br> Try it now.<br> Okay, try it again.<br> Easy! Easy! Easy!<br> Look, most of the damage<br> was restricted to his leg.<br> How bad is it?<br> God, l don't know.<br> lt's shattered.<br> Eleven, twelve breaks.<br> Something like that.<br> We're gonna have to operate.<br> Just sit tight for me.<br> Well, we're all done.<br> He'll always limp,<br> but it looks like<br> he's gonna walk again.<br> Will he ride?<br> No, he's not gonna ride.<br> You're sure?<br> He won't ride.<br> But he's gonna walk.<br> You take care.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey.<br> You should see<br> the other guy.<br> You're gonna be fine.<br> Couple of months,<br> you're gonna be up<br> and around like new.<br> l'm the one who makes up<br> the stories, remember?<br> Well, yeah.<br> Maybe a little<br> longer than that.<br> Yeah.<br> Look, l think we're gonna<br> have to scratch.<br> No. No, don't scratch.<br> Son, he's a great horse,<br> but he can't run by himself.<br> Don't scratch.<br> Call Woolf.<br> Son, nobody's riding...<br> lt's okay.<br> Call him.<br> Are you gonna scratch?<br> No, we're not gonna scratch.<br> Red Pollard wants<br> Seabiscuit to win this race<br> more than anything<br> in the world.<br> He wouldn't let us scratch.<br> Thank you much.<br> l appreciate it.<br> You're welcome.<br> The lceman cometh!<br> What a pinch hitter.<br> Why, it's like getting<br> Babe Ruth off the bench.<br> Nerves of steel,<br> ice water in his veins.<br> Why, George Woolf is...<br> lrrelevant.<br> They can get<br> the Four Horsemen<br> of the Apocalypse<br> as far as l'm concerned.<br> Won't make any difference.<br> War Admiral<br> is a superior horse<br> with superior breeding.<br> Doesn't matter<br> who the passenger is.<br> He's got a strong<br> left lead, Georgie.<br> Banks like<br> a frigging airplane.<br> But he might need help<br> switching to it,<br> so ease him off the rail<br> just before the turn.<br> Like you did<br> in the Gold Cup.<br> Exactly.<br> He needs a good warm-up,<br> so take him out slow.<br> When you do ask him,<br> don't use the whip.<br> Just flick it twice,<br> show him it's there.<br> He'll know it's time.<br> Right.<br> And never on the left side.<br> They hit him on the left side<br> when he was a baby.<br> l wish it was you, Johnny.<br> Come on.<br> l'll be right there with you.<br> Great. Now, show him the stick<br> at the quarter pole,<br> and he'll give you<br> a whole new gear.<br> Okay, now,<br> force him to that left lead<br> a little earlier,<br> and he'll give you even more.<br> Great.<br> Now, shut the door.<br> Okay. You know how Smith<br> wants you to fight for<br> the lead by the first turn?<br> Well, yeah. We were<br> working with that bell.<br> l was a little nervous<br> about that.<br> No, no, it's fine.<br> But you gotta give it up<br> on the backstretch.<br> Give it up?<br> Give him back the lead.<br> He fights for it, Georgie.<br> lf you bring him head to head<br> with that other horse,<br> and he looks him in the eye,<br> there's no way<br> he loses that race.<br> You just hold him<br> through that final turn<br> and let him get a good look<br> at the Admiral.<br> Then let him go.<br> lt's not in his feet, Georgie.<br> lt's right here.<br> By 10:00 a.m.,<br> the closest place to park<br> was 15 blocks away.<br> The volume of refreshments<br> alone was staggering.<br> Seventeen thousand gallons<br> of lemonade.<br> Sixty thousand hot dogs.<br> Two thousand kegs of beer.<br> NBC broadcast the race,<br> and businesses around America<br> scheduled a half day of work<br> so their employees<br> could hear the call,<br> thanks in part to a missive<br> fired by Mr. Howard<br> only the day before.<br> Look, l know this is<br> a fancy track and all,<br> but l think they ought to<br> open up the infield,<br> so normal folks<br> can come see the race.<br> You shouldn't have to be rich<br> to enjoy something like this.<br> Seabiscuit entered the race<br> a 2-to-1 underdog,<br> but you would never know it<br> from the growing noise<br> in the infield.<br> Get your program!<br> By the time it was over,<br> more than 48 million Americans<br> would hear the call.<br> Okay, it's still<br> kind of soggy at the rails,<br> so try to keep him<br> out of there.<br> There's a dry tractor tread<br> about five feet<br> out off the fence.<br> l walked the track<br> this morning.<br> Good. Good.<br> Now, he ought to break<br> just like we worked on.<br> But there's one more thing.<br> What? Let him catch me<br> on the backstretch?<br> You're not the only one<br> who knows this horse.<br> Safe trip, George.<br> And a short one.<br> Let's go, Sam.<br> Good luck, George.<br> Thanks, Nick.<br> Charley!<br> George.<br> The two jockeys have<br> acknowledged each other.<br> lt's a quick hello,<br> like boxers touching gloves.<br> Come on, George.<br> This is no time<br> for small talk.<br> Both the horses are now on<br> the main track, and you can<br> hear the roar from the crowd.<br> There he is!<br> lt's Seabiscuit by a nose,<br> now by a head.<br> He's leading War Admiral,<br> pressing on him a neck behind.<br> They fly<br> toward the clubhouse turn.<br> Who will be into it first?<br> lt's Seabiscuit heading<br> the turn first and driving<br> for the backstretch!<br> Now, coming out of the bend,<br> it's Seabiscuit<br> with a two-length lead<br> coming into the backstretch.<br> lt's Seabiscuit by two.<br> Now, back him off, son.<br> Back him off. Back him off.<br> Come on back, George.<br> Come on, come on, come on.<br> Now on<br> the backstretch, Seabiscuit<br> still with a two-length lead.<br> Come on, Georgie.<br> Don't fool around.<br> l sure hope you're right,<br> Red. Here we go.<br> Easy, Pops.<br> God damn it, Johnny.<br> lt's now War Admiral!<br> lt's War Admiral!<br> lt's Seabiscuit<br> and War Admiral,<br> neck and neck<br> as they go into<br> the homestretch!<br> Close, Pops. Easy, Pops.<br> That's it.<br> Come on.<br> lt's Seabiscuit.<br> Now War Admiral! Now<br> Seabiscuit! Now War Admiral!<br> Not going now, Pops.<br> Now Seabiscuit!<br> Now War Admiral!<br> Do it.<br> Do it now. Come on, George!<br> Turn him loose.<br> Turn him loose.<br> Do it now, George!<br> So long, Charley!<br> Turn him loose!<br> Here comes Seabiscuit!<br> lt's Seabiscuit by a length!<br> Come on, Biscuit!<br> Seabiscuit!<br> Yes! Yes! Yes!<br> Congratulations.<br> Amazing.<br> Congratulations.<br> Thank you.<br> lceman, you did it.<br> How does it feel?<br> Well, l just wish my good<br> friend Red Pollard was<br> up here today instead of me.<br> He will be.<br> This concludes<br> our radio broadcast<br> of the race of the century.<br> Now a word from our sponsor,<br> the American Oil Company.<br> Money can't buy<br> a finer motor oil...<br> Easy does it.<br> Watch it.<br> Watch those wheels.<br> All hail<br> the conquering hero.<br> Yes, folks, he's back.<br> The little engine that could.<br> No more match races<br> for this little pony,<br> because, quite frankly,<br> they're all out of matches.<br> Who's he gonna race? Pegasus?<br> l pity these other horses.<br> When will they know?<br> l don't know.<br> Maybe an hour. l'm not sure.<br> Charles is with the vet<br> right now.<br> Does it hurt when he bends it?<br> 'Cause if it doesn't hurt<br> when he bends it...<br> We don't know anything yet.<br> l'll call you<br> as soon as we do.<br> l promise.<br> All right.<br> He was running easy on me.<br> There was no warning.<br> He's gotta be all right.<br> He's gotta be all right.<br> l know.<br> Mr. Howard.<br> Well, he ruptured<br> a whole ligament.<br> l put a splint on him<br> just to keep him immobilized,<br> but right now<br> he's totally lame.<br> He's not gonna race again.<br> Look,<br> l know this is hard,<br> but l'll put him down for you<br> if you want me to.<br> Oh, that's okay, Pops.<br> l'll come to you.<br> Hey.<br> See, first, you gotta get<br> a little flexibility.<br> Yeah. Then you can<br> put weight on it.<br> Then once you start to put<br> weight on it,<br> the whole leg gets stronger.<br> l know. l know.<br> l'm in a hurry, too, Pops.<br> But you know what Hadrian said<br> about Rome.<br> "Brick by brick, my citizens.<br> "Brick by brick."<br> See,<br> they're Arabians,<br> so they don't need to drink.<br> These horses can go<br> five or six days<br> without a drop of water,<br> like a camel.<br> Oh, l'm not saying<br> that's what you should do.<br> l'm just saying<br> that's what they do.<br> Oh, good idea.<br> Take a little rest.<br> l don't know, Red.<br> We're just gonna<br> walk in a circle.<br> You think the leg<br> will hold you?<br> Horse weighs 1,200 pounds,<br> Sam. l'm an afterthought.<br> No, l mean your leg.<br> Here comes Seabiscuit<br> charging down the lane,<br> picking off competition<br> one by one.<br> He's third! Now second!<br> Now first!<br> And it's Seabiscuit<br> at the wire<br> to win the Santa Anita<br> Handicap with Red Pollard<br> aboard! Yes!<br> Nice.<br> What?<br> Whoa, Pops. Easy.<br> Whoa.<br> Wow, Pops.<br> You feel better,<br> don't you, boy?<br> lt's okay, Sam.<br> l'm just gonna mow<br> the lawn a little bit.<br> Fine with me, Red.<br> Way to go! All right.<br> Looking good. Yeah,<br> you're great, Red!<br> Oh, yes. Oh, yes.<br> Way to go, Red.<br> ls it even possible?<br> TOM: Sure.<br> Most folks don't<br> give it a chance.<br> Most folks just...<br> The best thing to do<br> is get him down there<br> and let him gallop a little.<br> l mean, that's the only way<br> we're really gonna know.<br> Can he handle that?<br> Sure. l mean, l think so.<br> He worked great.<br> l couldn't feel a thing.<br> Why don't we give him<br> a full work on Friday morning?<br> Maybe six furlongs.<br> See what we got.<br> Sure. l'll be here.<br> Thanks, George.<br> You're welcome.<br> Coming along.<br> Could he be ready?<br> For what?<br> Come on. You know what.<br> Top of the morning to you.<br> That's a nice colt.<br> Who is he?<br> Just a two-year-old.<br> He's not ready yet.<br> l thought maybe<br> you were getting a horse<br> ready for the Hundred Grander.<br> No. Just a two-year-old.<br> Hair of the dog.<br> You been here long?<br> No. Just got here.<br> Catching up on my reading.<br> Well, l'm sure<br> l'll see you soon.<br> Okey-dokey.<br> Stop the presses!<br> Stop the presses!<br> This isn't a scoop, folks.<br> This is three scoops<br> with hot fudge<br> and a cherry on top.<br> And throw in some nuts,<br> 'cause this little horse<br> drives me crazy!<br> Guess who may be working<br> six furlongs next Friday.<br> Guess who may be shooting<br> for the Big 'Cap.<br> Oh, my saints alive!<br> You guessed it. Man, oh, man!<br> Did you ever guess it!<br> A minute 12, minute 13.<br> Something like that.<br> lf he starts to labor,<br> just slow it down.<br> Try and see how he feels...<br> Got you.<br> That's all right, Pops.<br> That's okay, boy. That's okay.<br> Come here. lt's okay, boy.<br> "And this, the most<br> unkindest cut of all."<br> Red. Red,<br> let me talk to you.<br> Talk to me?<br> You can't... Red!<br> You can't do it!<br> You could be crippled<br> for the rest of your life.<br> l was crippled for the rest<br> of my life. l got better.<br> He made me better.<br> Hell, you made me better.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Red...<br> And that's as much my horse<br> as it is yours.<br> That's pretty quick.<br> God damn it.<br> lt's up to him, Red.<br> Yeah, but if he says<br> that l can't...<br> He's the doctor.<br> lt's up to him.<br> You made this?<br> Yeah. lt wraps around<br> my riding boot,<br> fasten it all the way<br> up the calf.<br> Right.<br> l barely feel anything<br> in the stirrups.<br> Look, it could shatter<br> at any moment,<br> even right now.<br> Forget about racing.<br> You see that right there?<br> That's barely healed.<br> There's no way to know<br> how much weight<br> it could hold under stress.<br> lf it gets reinjured,<br> it's possible he could<br> never walk again.<br> "Possible." He just said<br> it was "possible."<br> Well, hell,<br> anything's possible. We proved<br> that already, didn't we?<br> Red, this is different.<br> Yeah!<br> This is really different.<br> lt's not just some race.<br> lt's the Santa Anita.<br> l had that race. l was there.<br> l know.<br> What's going on?<br> Hell, even with the brace,<br> it'll barely hold him<br> if he gets bumped,<br> if he gets jostled...<br> Do you want to know<br> what l think?<br> Of course.<br> l think it's better to break<br> a man's leg than his heart.<br> lt's not just the leg.<br> lt's not!<br> Okay.<br> Mar, he could fall.<br> He could get trampled.<br> lf he gets thrown<br> from that horse...<br> He could die?<br> You know, l play<br> with this thing<br> all the time, too.<br> And no matter how hard l try,<br> l can't get that damn ball<br> to stay in the hole.<br> lt always rolls out again.<br> Just let him ride, Charles.<br> Just let him do it.<br> Jumping Jehoshaphat,<br> l could handle one comeback,<br> but this is ridiculous.<br> Who's next, Lazarus?<br> Oh, the heroism, the madness,<br> the excitement.<br> The largest crowd<br> ever to see a race<br> at Santa Anita!<br> and it's only 12:00!<br> lt's not bad.<br> St. Christopher. For luck.<br> A little late for that,<br> don't you think?<br> All right.<br> Let's go win us a race.<br> Ready?<br> Yeah.<br> Whichcee's the speed.<br> He's gonna be out on the lead,<br> but l don't think<br> he'll handle the distance.<br> Just stalk him like always.<br> Right.<br> Wedding Call<br> could make a late run.<br> Now, he's got some guts,<br> so look out for him, too.<br> Won't make that mistake again.<br> Relax, guys.<br> lt's gonna be fine.<br> Okay.<br> Charles, it's gonna be great.<br> Thank you, Frank.<br> Hope so. Bless you.<br> Good luck, Mr. Howard.<br> Thank you.<br> Good luck.<br> You're looking good.<br> Want a seat?<br> Relax. Buy you<br> a couple of drinks, huh?<br> That's a good idea.<br> Who you betting on?<br> Hey, old man.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Got another mount.<br> Just 'cause l'm not riding him<br> doesn't mean<br> l'm gonna sit it out.<br> Don't worry.<br> l don't stand a chance.<br> l'll see you at the finish.<br> Come on, boy.<br> Come on. Come on!<br> Come on! Go!<br> How you doing, Red?<br> Georgie.<br> You guys all right?<br> There you go, boy.<br> There it is.<br> Have a nice ride, Johnny.<br> Come on, Pops.<br> Ha! Ha!<br> Go home with it,<br> Johnny! Go on!<br> Come on, Red!<br> There it is, boy.<br> Come on, Biscuit!<br> You know,<br> everybody thinks we found<br> this broken-down horse<br> and fixed him,<br> but we didn't.<br> He fixed us.<br> Every one of us.<br> And l guess, in a way,<br> we kind of fixed<br> each other, too.<br>
