It really is.<br> Look here.<br> I'm gonna be a pastor<br> somewhere small.<br> College town.<br> Lead a little church.<br> Teach a class.<br> Maybe the occasional<br> speaking engagement.<br> And I'll pay<br> all the bills for us,<br> especially the mortgage<br> for our very own house.<br> Perfect.<br> You look handsome.<br> Through it all,<br> Martin Luther King<br> has spoken of his dream.<br> One which we<br> and many other people<br> around the world share.<br> To this undeterred hero<br> for justice,<br> the Nobel Committee<br> of Oslo, Norway,<br> awards our 1964 Peace Prize.<br> I accept this honor<br> for our lost ones,<br> whose deaths pave our path.<br> I accept this honor for<br> the more than 20 million<br> American Negroes<br> who are motivated<br> by dignity.<br> Together we believe that<br> what the illusion<br> of supremacy has destroyed,<br> the truth of equality<br> can nourish.<br> I promise you.<br> It ain't nothing<br> to be scared of.<br> It's quick. And the pastor<br> is right there next to you.<br> Yeah,<br> but the biggest thing is<br> getting your hair wet up.<br> I got my hair pressed<br> that same morning<br> and it was wasted<br> as soon as I hit the water.<br> I should have<br> worn a swim cap<br> like Mama said.<br> See,<br> I asked my mama<br> could she make my hair like<br> Coretta Scott King had hers<br> at the Washington March.<br> But she said<br> that was too grown.<br> Oh, I love her hair.<br> I heard she don't<br> even put rollers in it.<br> It's just like that.<br> But I studied it.<br> I know how she do it.<br> See, she parts<br> in the middle and then...<br> Annie Lee Cooper!<br> Get on up now.<br> I ain't got all day.<br> You work for Mr. Dunn<br> down at the rest home,<br> ain't that right?<br> Yes.<br> Wonder what old Dunn'll say<br> when I tell him<br> one of his gals is down here<br> stirring a fuss.<br> I ain't stirring no fuss.<br> I'm just here trying<br> to register to vote.<br> It's all right this time.<br> It's right<br> when I say it's right.<br> Recite the Constitution's<br> preamble.<br> Know what a preamble is?<br> "We the people<br> of the United States,<br> "in order to form<br> a more perfect union,<br> "establish justice,<br> "ensure domestic<br> tranquility,<br> "provide for<br> the common defense,<br> "promote the<br> general welfare..."<br> How many county judges<br> in Alabama?<br> Sixty-seven.<br> Name them.<br> Aren't we done?<br> Are we not done with this?<br> Will this ever end?<br> I don't know,<br> Mr. President.<br> A comprehensive plan<br> is already in place.<br> The act was only passed<br> six months ago.<br> So hammer home that<br> impatience only hurts<br> the overall cause.<br> We're...<br> We're getting there.<br> Just... Just keep<br> reiterating the plan.<br> No, he doesn't<br> want reiteration.<br> He wants something<br> so he can say,<br> "Look, I told you<br> I had a dream<br> "and it's all coming<br> goddamn true,<br> "whether you like it or not!"<br> That's what he wants.<br> What he needs to do<br> is get on board<br> with what we're doing<br> instead of the other<br> way around. For once!<br> Mr. President, Dr. King.<br> Mr. President.<br> Dr. King.<br> Well, I'll tell you.<br> I'm a tall son-of-a-bitch,<br> but this close to<br> the new Nobel laureate<br> and with all those<br> other trinkets<br> you've been collecting lately,<br> I feel tits-high<br> to a puppy dog.<br> Well, thank you,<br> Mr. President.<br> Mr. White.<br> Dr. King.<br> All right.<br> I'll tell you,<br> ending segregation,<br> proudest moment of my life<br> when I signed that '64 Act.<br> Proudest moment of my life,<br> I tell you.<br> Now civil rights<br> is a priority<br> of this administration<br> as you know.<br> Thank you.<br> We're gonna face<br> the challenge,<br> or this country is<br> storing up a heap<br> of trouble for itself.<br> Now, seeing as I can't<br> convince you to<br> work with<br> my administration<br> in an official capacity<br> inside the White House,<br> I feel damn fortunate<br> to have someone<br> as statesmanlike as you<br> leading the movement.<br> And I want you to go on<br> leading it. No one else.<br> Not one of these<br> militant Malcolm X types.<br> So... I wanna help.<br> Tell me how.<br> Well, Mr. President,<br> I'm here to speak<br> specifically<br> about the denial<br> of a basic American right<br> for the Negro citizen.<br> The right to vote.<br> Well, uh...<br> Technically...<br> Technically,<br> we already have it.<br> Yes, Mr. President.<br> But, we both know<br> in the South<br> black voters are<br> kept off the rolls<br> and out of<br> the voting booths<br> by systematic intimidation<br> and fear, Mr. President.<br> Now,<br> you asked how you can help.<br> We want<br> Federal legislation<br> granting Negroes the right<br> to vote unencumbered.<br> And we want Federal<br> protocol eliminating<br> the decades-long dismissal<br> and illegal denial of<br> blacks seeking to vote.<br> And we want<br> robust enforcement<br> of that protocol.<br> - Well, um...<br> - That's fine.<br> But... Most of the South<br> is still not desegregating.<br> Let's not start<br> another battle<br> when we haven't<br> even won the first.<br> And you know what<br> the next battle should be?<br> The eradication of poverty.<br> I'm calling it<br> "The War on Poverty."<br> It's a matter<br> of political priorities.<br> Poverty is going to be<br> my focus at home<br> and I want you<br> to help me with this.<br> We can make big changes<br> in these things<br> for people of all colors.<br> And I know that<br> matters to you,<br> doesn't it?<br> This voting thing<br> is just gonna have to wait.<br> It...<br> It can't wait, Mr. President.<br> Well, why not?<br> Because there have<br> been thousands<br> of racially motivated murders<br> in the South,<br> including those four girls.<br> Well, I know that...<br> And you know<br> the astounding fact<br> that not one<br> of these criminals<br> who murder us when<br> and why they want<br> has ever been convicted.<br> Yeah, I know we have a lot<br> of work to do down there.<br> Not one conviction<br> because they are protected<br> by white officials<br> chosen by<br> an all-white electorate.<br> And on the rare occasions<br> that they face trial,<br> they are freed<br> by all-white juries.<br> All-white because<br> you can't serve on a jury<br> unless you are<br> registered to vote.<br> Well, Dr. King,<br> you've certainly given me<br> something to think about.<br> But this administration<br> is going to set this<br> aside for a while.<br> Just for a while,<br> you understand.<br> Yes, Mr. President, I...<br> I understand.<br> Selma it is.<br> Big speech lined up<br> for these folks tonight, Doc?<br> We need to see<br> what's what first,<br> Big Fellow.<br> We're just here<br> to test the waters.<br> Oh, my Lord.<br> What you got us into, woman?<br> We've got 128 miles<br> to come to our senses,<br> gentlemen.<br> Hush.<br> This here is the place<br> we need to be.<br> This right here<br> is the next great battle.<br> I can only imagine.<br> Hmm.<br> Decent-looking place<br> to die though.<br> Ms. Nash.<br> Mr. Bevel.<br> Doc? This here is it.<br> Selma's the place.<br> A lot of groundwork<br> has already been laid<br> by the people here.<br> And they ready.<br> Sister Boynton.<br> Mr. Orange.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Dr. King?<br> May I introduce myself?<br> Yeah, of course.<br> Hey!<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> I'm okay.<br> This way, Dr. King.<br> That white boy can hit.<br> This place is perfect.<br> What's the FBI's<br> current information<br> on Martin Luther King?<br> I heard he was<br> assaulted in Selma.<br> My information can be<br> summed up in a few words.<br> King is a political<br> and moral degenerate.<br> Well, you say that, J. Edgar.<br> I have to take it seriously.<br> But if he's a degenerate,<br> what I do know is,<br> he's a non-violent<br> degenerate.<br> And I want him<br> to go on leading<br> the civil rights movement,<br> not one of these<br> bloodthirsty militants.<br> What I need to know<br> right now is<br> what's he about to do next?<br> Mr. President,<br> you know we can shut men<br> with power down<br> permanently<br> and unequivocally.<br> I'm very aware of that,<br> Mr. Director.<br> Well, if you prefer<br> a different approach,<br> we can go with the wife.<br> We know there's tension<br> in the home already.<br> We can weaken the dynamic.<br> Dismantle the family.<br> Hello.<br> You ain't got long.<br> When the hearts<br> of those Pickaninnies<br> of yours stop beating...<br> Same thing?<br> When are<br> you all heading out?<br> We're heading back<br> to Selma at 5:00 a.m.<br> It turned out to be<br> an ideal staging ground.<br> There's a full<br> couple of weeks planned.<br> Quite a bit to be done.<br> I see.<br> That highway is nice now.<br> Get you there<br> in a couple of hours.<br> Good people<br> in those parts though.<br> Well...<br> I'm worried about the ones<br> who ain't so good.<br> This local Sheriff Jim Clark<br> is supposed to be<br> bad business.<br> Won't go down<br> without a fight,<br> they say.<br> And since we don't fight...<br> Well...<br> As good a place to die<br> as any, I guess.<br> I wish you wouldn't<br> talk like that.<br> It just takes the edge off.<br> You and your friends<br> can joke about that.<br> I don't joke about that.<br> You're right. I'm sorry.<br> I'll, uh, put these things<br> away in your bag now.<br> I didn't realize<br> you were leaving so early.<br> Hello?<br> Halie?<br> Martin.<br> I need to hear<br> the Lord's voice.<br> Oh.<br> Surely, Martin. Surely.<br> Precious Lord<br> Take my hand<br> Lead me home<br> Let me stand<br> I am tired<br> I am weak<br> I am worn<br> Through the storm<br> Through the night<br> Lord, lead me on<br> To the light<br> Hey!<br> Hey!<br> Sully.<br> Look at you.<br> Morning, Doctor.<br> Good morning, Doctor.<br> Drive all right?<br> Good and long.<br> Good news is<br> Richie Jean is in there.<br> Oh, she's ready for you.<br> Negro, that's all<br> you had to say.<br> Uncle Marty!<br> There she is!<br> There's our girl!<br> Hey, Richie Jean!<br> Oh!<br> Looking<br> like her mom.<br> You go play.<br> Hey!<br> Hey, Ralphy.<br> How you doing?<br> Hey!<br> Good to see you,<br> sweetheart.<br> Hey, come over here.<br> Oh, Lord,<br> it's good to see this!<br> Okay, now, I've got<br> the grits on the stove.<br> Uh, how many<br> we expecting today?<br> Well, now, Sister Jackson.<br> You know about our group,<br> the SCLC, right?<br> The Southern Christian<br> Leadership Conference?<br> A few of our top SCLC leaders<br> are with us this time<br> since we're going to<br> be here a little longer<br> than expected.<br> Now, this here's<br> Reverend C.T. Vivian.<br> He coordinates all<br> the SCLC branches.<br> Welcome.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> Welcome, welcome.<br> This is<br> Reverend James Bevel.<br> How you doing, ma'am?<br> I'm well. Thank you.<br> This here<br> is James Orange.<br> Oh, this is a big one.<br> I don't know if I've got<br> enough to feed you.<br> Well, let's find out.<br> How about that?<br> Hey!<br> Now, you got two of them<br> named James.<br> Oh, you can<br> call me Jim, Sister.<br> And Orange is<br> fine with me, ma'am.<br> Or Big Fellow!<br> All right. Well,<br> this is fine with me.<br> Mrs. Jackson.<br> Hosea Williams.<br> Or Castro!<br> Oh, yeah,<br> that's a long story.<br> Uh, those grits, they need<br> some stirring. Mind?<br> You put<br> your foot in it now.<br> Ain't you supposed<br> to be on a diet?<br> Somebody call Juanita.<br> There's a phone!<br> Hey, get off that phone.<br> Juanita?<br> Don't do it, Doc.<br> Don't do it...<br> Turning in, Doc.<br> You okay?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Good night to you.<br> Uh...<br> I wanted to tell you that<br> the students are in town.<br> Local students?<br> Oh, no.<br> The Student Non-Violent<br> Coordinating Committee.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> Our young friends at SNCC.<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Good to know.<br> You the one<br> told them to organize.<br> Took it to heart.<br> Don't be surprised<br> if they don't give us<br> grief tomorrow.<br> Town folk may be happy<br> to see us. But SNCC?<br> They feel we're<br> in their territory.<br> They're young<br> and full of spirit.<br> Mmm.<br> Not a bad thing.<br> It'll sort out.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> "Boycotting the buses<br> in Montgomery.<br> "Segregation in Birmingham."<br> Boycotting the buses<br> in Montgomery.<br> Segregation in Birmingham.<br> Now? Voting in Selma.<br> One struggle ends<br> just to go<br> right to the next<br> and the next.<br> If you think of it that way,<br> it's a hard road.<br> But I don't think<br> of it that way.<br> I think of these efforts<br> as one effort.<br> And that one effort<br> is for our life.<br> Our life as a community.<br> Our life as a nation.<br> For our lives.<br> We can do this.<br> We must do this!<br> We see children<br> become victims of one<br> of the most vicious crimes<br> ever perpetrated<br> against humanity<br> within the walls<br> of their own church!<br> They are sainted now.<br> They are the sainted ones<br> in this quest for freedom.<br> And they speak to us still.<br> They say to us,<br> to all of us,<br> all colors and creeds,<br> that we must do this.<br> They say to us<br> that it is unacceptable<br> for more than 50% of Selma<br> to be Negro<br> and yet less than 2%<br> of Negroes here<br> being able to vote<br> and determine their own<br> destiny as human beings.<br> They say to us that<br> the local white leadership<br> use their power<br> to keep us away<br> from the ballot box<br> and keep us voiceless.<br> As long as I am unable<br> to exercise<br> my constitutional<br> right to vote,<br> I do not have command<br> of my own life.<br> I cannot determine<br> my own destiny<br> for it is determined for me<br> by people who would rather<br> see me suffer than succeed.<br> Those that have<br> gone before us say,<br> "No more!"<br> No more! No more!<br> No more!<br> That means protest,<br> that means march,<br> that means disturb the peace,<br> that means jail,<br> that means risk!<br> And that is hard!<br> We will not wait any longer.<br> Give us the vote!<br> That's right! No more!<br> We're not asking.<br> We're demanding.<br> Give us the vote!<br> Give us the vote!<br> Dr. King. Roy Reed<br> of The New York Times.<br> Yes. Hello to you.<br> How are you?<br> I'm well, sir.<br> Thank you for asking.<br> Dr. King, are you<br> truly non-violent<br> if you are<br> provoking violence, sir?<br> We are here, using<br> our very bodies in protest<br> to say to those<br> who deny us...<br> Dr. King. Dr. King.<br> Pleasure, sir.<br> ...that we will<br> no longer let them use<br> their billy clubs<br> in dark corners<br> and halls of power.<br> We make them do it<br> in the glaring light<br> of day, Mr. Reed.<br> Is SNCC standing with us<br> on this or not, gentlemen?<br> You want us to<br> bring our people in,<br> but you're not giving<br> anything in return.<br> Now we are asking for<br> some kind of commitment here.<br> Respectfully speaking,<br> of course,<br> we've been handling<br> the voter registration<br> in this town now<br> for two years.<br> Well, you haven't gotten<br> very far, have you?<br> Well, maybe not, Reverend.<br> But we're still here.<br> Meaning what?<br> This time next month,<br> you won't be!<br> That's insanity!<br> Just like you left Albany.<br> Those people are pathetic<br> down there now.<br> Like they daddy left home!<br> What we're trying<br> to explain is that<br> in Albany you all...<br> You know what I think?<br> Maybe we should<br> just leave Selma...<br> Now!<br> Leave it to these two.<br> Come back in<br> another two years<br> and see how much<br> further you got!<br> Sounds just fine to me.<br> That's enough.<br> Enough of this now.<br> I haven't the time for this.<br> None of us<br> got the time for this.<br> John.<br> James.<br> The way our organization<br> works is straightforward.<br> We negotiate.<br> We demonstrate.<br> We resist.<br> And on our best days,<br> our adversary<br> helps the matter<br> by making a mistake.<br> Now, we were in Albany<br> for nine months<br> and we made<br> a lot of mistakes.<br> But their sheriff,<br> Laurie Pritchett,<br> he never made a mistake.<br> Kept his cool,<br> kept arresting us<br> in a humane way,<br> carried people to<br> the jail-wagons<br> on stretchers.<br> Day in, day out.<br> There was no drama.<br> You mean<br> there was no cameras.<br> Exactly.<br> Now I know,<br> we all understand,<br> that you young people<br> believe in working in<br> the community long-term.<br> Doing the good work<br> to raise black<br> consciousness.<br> It's good grassroots work.<br> I can't tell you<br> how much we admire that.<br> But what we do<br> is negotiate,<br> demonstrate,<br> resist.<br> And a big part of that<br> is raising<br> white consciousness.<br> And in particular<br> the consciousness<br> of whichever white man<br> happens to be sitting<br> in the Oval Office.<br> Right now, Johnson<br> has other fish to fry<br> and he'll ignore us<br> if he can.<br> The only way to<br> stop him doing that<br> is by being on<br> the front page<br> of the national press<br> every morning<br> and by being on the TV news<br> every night.<br> And that requires<br> drama.<br> Now...<br> John.<br> James.<br> Answer me one question.<br> I've been told<br> the sheriff in this town<br> isn't like Laurie Pritchett<br> in Albany.<br> He's a big ignorant bully<br> like Bull Connor<br> in Birmingham.<br> Well, you tell me.<br> You know Selma.<br> You know Sheriff Jim Clark.<br> Is he Laurie Pritchett?<br> Or is he Bull Connor?<br> He's Bull Connor.<br> Bingo!<br> Good.<br> That's good.<br> But it gets better.<br> See, Clark doesn't<br> control the streets<br> like Connor did in Birmingham.<br> Clark's the County Sheriff,<br> and all he controls in Selma<br> is the County Courthouse.<br> So relatively speaking,<br> we have clear avenues<br> of approach<br> to a defined battle zone.<br> In the courthouse sits<br> the heart of the matter,<br> the voter registration office.<br> Now this is<br> an exceptional circumstance.<br> See, in Albany, there were no<br> clearly defined battle zones.<br> The issue was segregation,<br> and segregation<br> was everywhere.<br> In Selma, we can concentrate<br> our actions on one building.<br> A citadel,<br> defended by fanatics.<br> The Selma Courthouse.<br> A perfect stage.<br> Y'all deliberately<br> causing an obstruction!<br> You don't disperse,<br> you're gonna be arrested.<br> I promise you!<br> Sheriff Clark,<br> we're trying to gain access<br> to the registration office.<br> Which is our legal right.<br> There's too many of you.<br> And you know damn well<br> there is!<br> Now, y'all just gonna have<br> to wait at the rear!<br> No, Sheriff Clark.<br> We're going in the front<br> and we're gonna<br> wait right here.<br> Segregation is now illegal<br> in this country, sir.<br> Get out, nigger.<br> Come on.<br> I'm trying.<br> Kneel down, Daddy.<br> Come on.<br> Keep this sidewalk clear.<br> Clear a path!<br> Get out of the way!<br> Get out of the way!<br> Get the hell out of the way!<br> Keep the sidewalk clear!<br> I said keep it clear!<br> Okay. We about to sit<br> him down. He can't sit.<br> Then he needs to learn.<br> He gonna sit.<br> Sit down, God damn it!<br> Hey, hey! Pa? Pa?<br> Daddy.<br> I just told you<br> he can't sit.<br> Oh,<br> what do we got here?<br> What's going on here, boy?<br> What we got here?<br> What we got here?<br> Jimmie! Sit down!<br> No, Mama, I'm sick of this.<br> Jimmie!<br> Don't do it.<br> Do you have a problem, boy?<br> I'm sick of this!<br> I just told you...<br> What'd you think, boy?<br> What'd you think?<br> What the fuck<br> are you thinking?<br> Get that nigger woman!<br> Kill that nigger bitch!<br> Get your hands off of me!<br> We will not tolerate<br> a bunch of nigra agitators<br> attempting to orchestrate<br> a disturbance in this state.<br> Not as long as I'm governor.<br> Now, I stand here today<br> in the cradle<br> of the Confederacy<br> to remind its people<br> of our Founding Fathers'<br> goals of duty.<br> Goals long since forgotten<br> by progressives and liberals<br> in favor of what they call<br> a changing world.<br> They seek to make us<br> one mongrel unit.<br> Instead of allowing<br> each race to flourish<br> from its separate<br> racial station<br> as has been the standard<br> for generations now.<br> Good morning,<br> Mr. President.<br> Their changing world<br> is sickening the balance<br> of the Southland.<br> Now...<br> I pledged to stand up<br> for Alabama when I campaigned<br> and the people elected me<br> on that pledge,<br> and that is exactly<br> what I intend to do.<br> Johnson'll flinch.<br> I'm tired, Ralphy.<br> Tiring of this.<br> Eyes on the prize, Martin.<br> Yeah, but what is<br> the prize, friend?<br> We fight to have a seat<br> at whatever table we want.<br> How does it help<br> a black man<br> to be able to eat<br> at a lunch counter<br> if he doesn't earn enough<br> to buy the burger?<br> Or worse yet,<br> can't even...<br> Can't even read the menu<br> 'cause there was no Negro<br> school where he's from.<br> What is that?<br> That equality?<br> Amen.<br> And what about<br> in our minds?<br> Equality in the black psyche.<br> Look at these men.<br> Beaten and broken down<br> for generations.<br> Deciding to demand more?<br> What happens when<br> a man stands up and<br> says enough is enough?<br> Look at Medgar.<br> Murdered the man<br> in his own driveway.<br> Kids and wife right there<br> inside the house.<br> George and Herbert Lee,<br> Lamar Smith.<br> A man stands up,<br> only to be struck down.<br> And what happens<br> to the people he led?<br> What are we doing, Ralphy?<br> We take it<br> piece by piece.<br> Like we been doing.<br> We build the path as we can.<br> Rock by rock.<br> This cell<br> is probably bugged.<br> It probably is.<br> Oh, Lord.<br> They're gonna ruin me so they<br> can ruin this movement.<br> They are.<br> "Look at the birds<br> of the air,<br> "that they do not sow,<br> nor reap,<br> "nor gather into barns,<br> "and yet your Heavenly Father<br> doth feed them.<br> "Are you not worth<br> much more than they?<br> "And who of you<br> by being worried<br> "can add a single hour<br> to his life?"<br> Matthew 6, verse 27.<br> All right.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What?<br> Where did you hear that?<br> I overhead<br> them talking<br> about him coming in<br> this evening.<br> Overhead us?<br> I'm learning about this<br> just like you.<br> We didn't do this.<br> That Negro<br> can't be talking about that<br> "by any means necessary"<br> madness with these people.<br> They about to bust as it is.<br> He's on his way here,<br> right?<br> So we gotta<br> figure this out.<br> Right and fast.<br> Oh, he ain't on his way.<br> He here.<br> Holy shit.<br> Are you all right?<br> I wish I had more time<br> to prepare is all.<br> I want to do this kind of<br> thing whenever possible.<br> But I don't get to<br> do it enough<br> to feel entirely<br> comfortable.<br> I prefer to be prepared.<br> Yes, I understand that.<br> I admire you. I do.<br> Sometimes I wish<br> I were more out there<br> in the trenches.<br> You do more than<br> you know, Mrs. King.<br> I'll tell you what<br> I know to be true.<br> It helps me in times<br> when I'm feeling unsure.<br> If you'd like.<br> Oh, please do,<br> Mrs. Boynton.<br> I know that<br> we are descendants<br> of a mighty people,<br> who gave civilization<br> to the world.<br> People who survived<br> the hulls of slave ships<br> across vast oceans.<br> People who innovate<br> and create and love<br> despite pressures<br> and tortures unimaginable.<br> They are in our bloodstream.<br> Pumping our hearts<br> every second.<br> They've prepared you.<br> You are already prepared.<br> Mrs. King, I mean<br> no disrespect.<br> I come with great respect<br> for your husband.<br> I have no army<br> behind me anymore.<br> I have myself and the truth.<br> That is all I stand on today.<br> You've said disrespectful<br> things in the past, Minister.<br> So you'll understand<br> why there is some<br> alarm here tonight.<br> I do. I understand that.<br> Your husband and I,<br> we do not see<br> exactly eye-to-eye<br> on how to achieve progress<br> for the black man.<br> And yes,<br> I have been piercing<br> in my critiques<br> of non-violence.<br> But because we don't agree,<br> Mrs. King,<br> does not mean<br> that I'm the enemy.<br> What do you intend to say<br> to these people then, sir?<br> A lot of work<br> has been done here,<br> and I don't intend to<br> see it undone tonight.<br> Let's just say,<br> my eyes see in a new way.<br> But your local sheriff here?<br> He doesn't know that.<br> So allow me to be the<br> alternative to your husband.<br> The alternative that<br> scares them so much<br> they turn to<br> Dr. King in refuge.<br> Let my being here, Mrs. King,<br> represent the factions<br> that will come if they don't<br> give the good reverend<br> what he's asking for and soon.<br> Do you know what he has said<br> about us in the past, Coretta?<br> He called us<br> "ignorant Negro preachers."<br> Called me<br> a modern day Uncle Tom.<br> Said on national television<br> that the white man pays me<br> to keep Negroes defenseless.<br> The white man pays me!<br> How could you allow it?<br> It wasn't like that<br> this time, Martin.<br> I'm telling you...<br> He spoke with some of<br> the words he's used before,<br> but it wasn't aimed at you.<br> It was...<br> It had more to do<br> with helping us.<br> Not that you need his help.<br> I'm just telling you<br> how it was.<br> This movement, our movement,<br> has been the one that<br> has moved the needle.<br> Our movement changes laws<br> and day-to-day life<br> for our people.<br> But what has he changed?<br> Actually changed?<br> You don't sound like yourself.<br> You sound tired.<br> And you sound enamored.<br> I didn't mean that.<br> Corrie.<br> Coretta.<br> I didn't mean that.<br> I'm tired.<br> You're right.<br> Rest then.<br> Rest tonight, Martin.<br> This is not<br> what I want to hear.<br> How in Christ's sake does<br> Malcolm X slip into my state,<br> meet with the wife<br> of the other one,<br> and give an actual speech<br> to these nigras<br> who are already<br> riled up enough?<br> I mean, how does that happen,<br> Colonel Lingo?<br> Governor...<br> Is every spook militant<br> in existence<br> gonna pay us a visit?<br> Huh?<br> Do you know what this means?<br> Johnson is going to<br> get jumpy.<br> King and X together<br> is sending him<br> through the cotton-pickin'<br> stratosphere.<br> And pictures of nigras<br> getting beat in the street<br> doesn't help the matter.<br> Governor...<br> Now I can't make a move<br> against that backwoods,<br> white trash Sheriff Clark<br> 'cause that'll be seen<br> as I'm helping King.<br> But somebody got to<br> get Jim Clark under control.<br> Election year is coming up<br> and this black voting<br> business won't abide.<br> I mean, what's not<br> clear about that?<br> Look, George,<br> I'm telling you,<br> if the Lord Jesus<br> and Elvis Presley<br> come visiting and they said,<br> "Jim, now, we need you to<br> treat them niggers nice."<br> Jim Clark would beat the shit<br> out of the pair of them,<br> then throw them in jail.<br> Jesus H. Christ.<br> Jim's a good old boy,<br> he's a friend of mine.<br> Jim Clark just ain't<br> that scary.<br> Now he's playing<br> into their hands.<br> Now...<br> If you want fear,<br> you need dominance in Selma.<br> Hoover picked up some intel<br> about a night march.<br> Wasn't announced.<br> It's some locals<br> outside of King's group.<br> Unofficial, they called it.<br> Supposed to happen<br> tomorrow night<br> once King leaves jail.<br> Going to some bleeding heart<br> fundraiser in California.<br> So...<br> King's out of town.<br> Fewer cameras.<br> And at night.<br> Find a reason to<br> send us in there.<br> Let's scare some real sense<br> into them black bastards.<br> Y'all move back.<br> Move back now. Get back.<br> Go back to your homes now.<br> Stop!<br> Leave him be!<br> Mama, come on!<br> Mama, come on!<br> We gotta keep moving.<br> Come on.<br> This way, this way.<br> Leave him alone.<br> It's all right.<br> It's gonna be all right.<br> Okay?<br> Act like you're...<br> Act like you're<br> reading your menu. Okay?<br> It's okay.<br> Pops...<br> It's all right, Mama.<br> It's gonna be cool.<br> It's okay, it's okay.<br> Hey! Hey...<br> No, get off of him!<br> Just get off of him!<br> Get off of him! No!<br> No! Get off of him!<br> Stop it! No, no, no!<br> Stop it!<br> Help me.<br> Help me.<br> Jimmie.<br> Jimmie. Jimmie. Jimmie.<br> Help me.<br> Sir?<br> Oh. Dr. King.<br> There are no words<br> to soothe you, Mr. Lee.<br> There are no words.<br> But I can tell you<br> one thing for certain.<br> God was the first to cry.<br> Yes.<br> He was the first<br> to cry for your boy.<br> Yes. I believe that.<br> Is your daughter...<br> Is Jimmie Lee's mother<br> here, Mr. Lee?<br> No, she...<br> She couldn't make it.<br> May I ask your age, sir?<br> Well, I...<br> I got 82 years.<br> Right.<br> Yeah.<br> Jimmie...<br> He born in '38.<br> He a Army man.<br> I mean, he was...<br> Was an Army man.<br> In the Army a spell.<br> He say, "Pa, you gonna vote<br> before you done."<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> That's what he said.<br> He tell me.<br> He was a good boy.<br> Yes.<br> Always good.<br> Always good.<br> Jimmie gone.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Yeah.<br> Who murdered<br> Jimmie Lee Jackson?<br> Who murdered<br> Jimmie Lee Jackson?<br> We know a state trooper<br> acting under the orders<br> of George Wallace<br> pointed the gun<br> and pulled the trigger.<br> But how many other fingers<br> were on that trigger?<br> Who murdered<br> Jimmie Lee Jackson?<br> Every white lawman who<br> abuses the law to terrorize.<br> Every white politician<br> who feeds on<br> prejudice and hatred.<br> Every white preacher<br> who preaches the Bible<br> and stays silent before<br> his white congregation.<br> Who murdered<br> Jimmie Lee Jackson?<br> Every Negro man and woman<br> who stands by<br> without joining this fight<br> as their brothers and sisters<br> are humiliated,<br> brutalized, and ripped<br> from this earth!<br> When I heard<br> President Kennedy<br> had been shot and killed...<br> And when I heard<br> just yesterday<br> that Malcolm X,<br> who stood in this very church<br> just three weeks ago,<br> had been shot and killed,<br> I turned to my wife Coretta<br> and said the same thing<br> I often say<br> when one of our leaders<br> is struck down,<br> "Our lives<br> are not fully lived<br> "if we're not willing to die<br> for those we love<br> "and for what we believe."<br> But today, Jimmie,<br> we're doing the living<br> and you've done the dying,<br> dear brother.<br> We will not let your sacrifice<br> pass in vain, dear brother.<br> We will not let it go!<br> We will finish<br> what you were after!<br> We will get<br> what you were denied!<br> We will vote and we will<br> put these men out of office!<br> We will take their power!<br> We will win what<br> you were slaughtered for!<br> Yeah!<br> We're going back<br> to Washington.<br> We're going to demand to<br> see the President.<br> And I'm gonna tell him<br> that Jimmie was murdered<br> by an administration<br> that spends millions<br> of dollars every day<br> to sacrifice life<br> in the name of liberty<br> in Vietnam,<br> yet lacks the moral will<br> and the moral courage<br> to defend the lives<br> of its own people<br> here in America!<br> We will not let it go!<br> And if he does not act,<br> we will act. We will act!<br> We will do it<br> for all of our lost ones.<br> All of those,<br> like Jimmie Lee Jackson,<br> who have gone too soon,<br> taken by hate!<br> Let me hear<br> the top-tier issues<br> that have to be evident<br> in the overall<br> legislation we demand.<br> Let's break it down.<br> But let's root<br> this discussion<br> in what we know.<br> We know Johnson<br> can't see the full picture.<br> So, let's paint it for him.<br> What are the specific<br> hardships and humiliations<br> we can address<br> within the larger<br> context of legislation?<br> Doc, we gotta start with<br> banning these laws that<br> if a Negro tries<br> to register,<br> I mean,<br> actually musters up<br> the courage to go<br> in that courthouse,<br> that their name and address<br> is published in the paper.<br> It gives anybody who wants<br> to do them any harm<br> their exact location,<br> and we know how the Klan is.<br> I hear that.<br> But the poll taxes<br> got to be our focus first.<br> 'Cause black people are poor!<br> Black people<br> are poor down here.<br> Yep.<br> And they expected<br> to pay for every year<br> they weren't<br> legally registered<br> before they can register.<br> Now, what the hell is that?<br> Who got that kind of money?<br> Come on now!<br> Listen now!<br> The big issue is<br> voting vouchers.<br> Is that the number one issue?<br> Now hold on.<br> Let me finish.<br> 'Cause everybody'll forget<br> about this part.<br> But if you're Negro,<br> the only way you can vote<br> is if an approved registered<br> voter vouches for you.<br> Right? So, let's say,<br> you take some place<br> like Lowndes County,<br> where there are no Negroes<br> who are registered<br> and you've got to have<br> someone who is registered<br> to vouch for you.<br> What are you supposed to do?<br> Hmm?<br> Mmm.<br> Nobody you know,<br> not a single black person<br> for 100 miles is registered.<br> So how do you<br> get the voucher, right?<br> To get you into<br> the courthouse door<br> to pay the poll tax<br> to get your name published<br> and get yourself dead.<br> That's true.<br> We need a new plan!<br> I can't take him<br> back to Washington<br> and waltz into the White House<br> with a list of empty demands.<br> Tactics, my friends!<br> We must break down<br> this institution<br> into the tangible<br> tactics that it takes<br> to dismantle it.<br> What's your next move?<br> A march from Selma<br> to Montgomery<br> to protest and amplify.<br> Well, I'll be damned.<br> This was always<br> part of the plan,<br> wasn't it?<br> Provoke some tragedy<br> in little old Selma,<br> then go big.<br> Get someone killed and<br> march on the State Capitol!<br> Selma to Montgomery's<br> gotta be 50 miles!<br> You march those people into<br> rural Alabama unprotected,<br> it's gonna be open season.<br> It's too damn far<br> and too damn dangerous!<br> Then propose<br> new legislation, sir.<br> I can't do that this year.<br> I won't! I told you.<br> We need your<br> involvement here,<br> Mr. President.<br> We deserve your help<br> as citizens of this country.<br> Citizens under attack.<br> Now, you listen to me.<br> You listen to me.<br> You're an activist.<br> I'm a politician.<br> You got one big issue.<br> I got a hundred and one.<br> Now, you demanding more<br> and putting me on the spot<br> with this visit, that's okay.<br> That's your job.<br> That's what you do.<br> But I am sick and tired<br> of you demanding<br> and telling me<br> what I can<br> and what I can't do.<br> If you want my support<br> on this voting thing,<br> I need some quid pro quo<br> from you.<br> What do you want,<br> Mr. President?<br> We have a line on<br> some threats that are, uh,<br> particularly troubling.<br> Well, what's new?<br> No, no. This is serious.<br> Credible threats with detail.<br> This information,<br> coming from the FBI,<br> I assume?<br> High-level?<br> The same high-level<br> that's been tracking us<br> like animals?<br> Bugging our homes<br> and our hotel rooms.<br> Digging for things that<br> simply are not there, Lee?<br> This all feels<br> very convenient.<br> Okay.<br> This is coming from<br> Lowndes County, Alabama.<br> Between Selma and Montgomery.<br> I'm telling you,<br> if he were my guy,<br> I'd keep him<br> off the frontlines.<br> Just for a while.<br> Not gonna happen, Lee.<br> Meet me halfway<br> on this, Martin.<br> I can't, Mr. President.<br> Can't or won't?<br> I came here hoping<br> to talk to you<br> about people.<br> People are dying<br> in the street for this.<br> It cannot wait, sir.<br> Mr. President,<br> how did it go?<br> What can I do to help?<br> Get me J. Edgar Hoover.<br> King,<br> you know<br> you are a complete fraud<br> and a liability<br> to all nigras.<br> Like all frauds,<br> your end is approaching.<br> You are done.<br> Your degrees and your fancy<br> awards will not save you.<br> The American public<br> will soon know you<br> for what you are,<br> an evil, abnormal beast.<br> That wasn't me.<br> That isn't me, Corrie.<br> I know.<br> I know what<br> you sound like.<br> I've gotten used to a lot.<br> All the hours<br> wondering after your safety,<br> worried about how you are.<br> This house.<br> Renting here.<br> No foundation.<br> Without the things<br> the children should have,<br> all because of<br> how it would look.<br> I have gotten used to it,<br> for better or worse.<br> But what I have<br> never gotten used to<br> is the death.<br> The constant closeness<br> of death.<br> It's become like<br> a thick fog to me.<br> I can't see life sometimes<br> because of the fog of death<br> constantly hanging over.<br> People actually say that<br> they will stop the blood<br> running through the hearts<br> of our children.<br> That's what they said on the<br> other end of that phone line.<br> How they're going to<br> kill my children.<br> And what they'll do to you<br> and how they'll do it.<br> How many years have I<br> had to listen to this?<br> The filth,<br> deranged and twisted<br> and just ignorant enough<br> to be serious.<br> If I ask you something,<br> will you answer me<br> with the truth?<br> Yes.<br> Good,<br> because I am not a fool.<br> Do you love me?<br> Yes, I love you, Coretta.<br> Do you love<br> any of the others?<br> No.<br> I need to put the march<br> back a day.<br> Why?<br> I have to be<br> home right now.<br> Oh.<br> Yes. Okay. I understand.<br> But I have to tell you<br> the organization looks good.<br> Real good.<br> The mood is strong.<br> And the locals are prepared.<br> The SNCC kids are ready to go.<br> We can start it off<br> from Selma,<br> and you can join in<br> on the second day.<br> I just think it'd be a mistake<br> to hold people back<br> when their blood is up.<br> I hear you,<br> but we need to be out there<br> full throttle.<br> This ain't a test run.<br> We need to get to Montgomery.<br> I warned Johnson that<br> we were going to the Capitol.<br> We need to do just that.<br> And I believe we will.<br> We'll get there.<br> And when we do the real deal,<br> the finale,<br> when you make the big speech<br> at the end,<br> right on Wallace's doorstep.<br> I don't know, Andy.<br> It'll be just fine.<br> We'll get it started strong.<br> And you'll finish strong.<br> Mmm.<br> Okay. Uh... Let's proceed.<br> But only one of us<br> walks to start.<br> I don't want to<br> get back on Monday<br> and find all<br> our leadership in jail.<br> One of us walks.<br> Understood.<br> There will be no march<br> from Selma to Montgomery.<br> It is not conducive to<br> traffic flow on Route 80.<br> Or to public safety.<br> Your lives could<br> be in danger,<br> but we're going to be strong<br> if we stick together.<br> Don't fight back.<br> It's a non-violent movement.<br> Non-violence is not passive.<br> It's actually very strong.<br> We shouldn't<br> do this, John.<br> This is not us.<br> This is not SNCC.<br> It's some bullshit.<br> It's gonna do more for King<br> and the SCLC than for Selma.<br> This is Alabama.<br> They can keep their asses<br> in Washington, D.C.<br> You don't tell us<br> how to live our lives.<br> This is an example of what<br> you might deal with out there.<br> What you might experience.<br> Here we go. Let's show them.<br> We don't want<br> your kind here.<br> Go to the bottom<br> of the river, black boy.<br> We're going to put you down<br> in Alabama River!<br> He's not even here.<br> How's it gonna<br> do more for him?<br> Well, why ain't<br> he here, then, man?<br> Are you listening<br> to yourself?<br> First, it's gonna<br> do more for him.<br> Now, it's why<br> he ain't here?<br> Do you want him here,<br> or do you not want him here?<br> Honestly, I don't<br> give a rat's ass<br> about that man.<br> That's your hero.<br> Let's take these bastards<br> and stick them down<br> into Alabama River<br> and never see them again.<br> James, you are<br> so off-base with this.<br> All this nonsense.<br> This ain't what<br> SNCC is about.<br> Don't make me out to be<br> the bad guy here, John.<br> I'm not! You're the one<br> playing me small.<br> Don't demonize me...<br> You're mad because<br> they called him in.<br> We were here first.<br> And they called him in.<br> I get it. I understand that.<br> But if we are really<br> and truly for the people,<br> and the people of Selma<br> chose him,<br> well, then the people<br> have spoken.<br> And if they want to march,<br> then I'm marching with them.<br> Then, brother,<br> you're marching<br> as John Lewis.<br> Not as part of SNCC.<br> It's been voted on<br> and decided.<br> For this march,<br> you're on your own<br> with De Lawd<br> and his disciples.<br> Short man wins.<br> Short man wins.<br> Short man wins.<br> All right.<br> All right. Who got it?<br> It's on you, Hosea.<br> You ready,<br> young blood? You ready?<br> All right. Let's do this.<br> All right.<br> About 525 Negroes<br> had left Brown's Chapel<br> and walked six blocks to cross<br> Pettus Bridge<br> and the Alabama River.<br> There were young and old,<br> and they carried<br> an assortment of packs,<br> bed rolls<br> and lunch sacks.<br> The troopers were waiting<br> 300 yards beyond<br> the end of the bridge.<br> Behind the troopers<br> were dozens of possemen,<br> 15 of them on horses,<br> and perhaps<br> 100 white spectators.<br> Can you swim?<br> Not many swimming pools for<br> black folk where I come from.<br> Yeah.<br> Andy, it's Bayard.<br> Everybody there?<br> Yes.<br> Turn on CBS<br> right now, Andy.<br> Right now.<br> You have a TV there?<br> Yes. Now?<br> Right now!<br> Turn on the television set.<br> We interrupt<br> this program to bring you<br> a special bulletin<br> from CBS News.<br> Give 'em two minutes.<br> Stand right there.<br> We're ready.<br> This is an unlawful assembly.<br> You have two minutes<br> to disperse.<br> Go home or go to your church.<br> This march will not continue.<br> Two minutes.<br> May I have<br> a word with the Major?<br> There's no word to be had.<br> Major Cloud,<br> may we speak with you?<br> Troopers, advance!<br> Seventy million people<br> are watching this.<br> The first<br> 10 or 20 Negroes<br> were swept to the ground<br> screaming,<br> arms and legs flying,<br> packs and bags went skittering<br> across the grassy divider.<br> Those still<br> on their feet retreated.<br> A cheer went up<br> from the white spectators<br> lining the south side<br> of the highway.<br> Come on.<br> You gotta come on.<br> Please, don't...<br> The troopers<br> continued pushing,<br> using both the force<br> of their bodies<br> and the prodding<br> of their nightsticks.<br> Suddenly, there was<br> a sharp sound, like a gunshot,<br> and a gray cloud spewed over<br> the troopers and the Negroes.<br> But before the cloud<br> hid it all,<br> there were several seconds<br> of unobstructed view.<br> Fifteen or 20<br> nightsticks<br> could be seen through the gas,<br> flailing at the heads<br> of the marchers.<br> Ahhh!<br> The Negroes cried out<br> as they crowded together<br> for protection,<br> and the whites on the<br> sidelines whooped and cheered.<br> From the hospital<br> came reports of victims<br> suffering fractures of ribs,<br> heads, arms and legs.<br> And Negro leader John Lewis,<br> despite injury from<br> a possible skull fracture,<br> led the marchers<br> back to the chapel<br> after the encounter<br> with officers.<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> He said, "I don't see<br> how President Johnson<br> "can send troops to Vietnam<br> "and can't send troops<br> to Selma, Alabama."<br> To which the Negroes present<br> roared their approval.<br> Gerry! Gerry,<br> come with us! Come with us!<br> We need your gun, man!<br> I can't walk!<br> Come with us.<br> We know you got them<br> guns in the shed, Gerry.<br> Hey, hey, hey,<br> what you need guns for?<br> The Bible says,<br> "An eye for an eye," Reverend.<br> Yeah?<br> I'm sick of this shit!<br> How many guns<br> you think they<br> got down there?<br> That's an entire army<br> down there.<br> What you got? A couple<br> of .32s? A .38?<br> Maybe a couple<br> of old scatterguns? What?<br> I got enough<br> to kill a couple<br> of them crackers,<br> that's what I got!<br> And how many of us you think<br> they gonna kill<br> in retaliation?<br> With their 12-gauge<br> pump-actions,<br> their Colt automatics,<br> their Remingtons, their<br> helicopters, their tanks!<br> We won't win that way,<br> and I ain't talking<br> about the Bible.<br> I ain't talking<br> what's right by God.<br> I am talking facts.<br> Cold, hard facts!<br> Now, you take two of them,<br> and they take 10 of us.<br> No. We have<br> to win another way.<br> ...to our<br> regularly scheduled program.<br> We're going<br> back to the bridge.<br> We're going to finish this,<br> we promise you that,<br> Ms. Amelia.<br> We go again.<br> Dr. King!<br> Can we get a statement, sir?<br> Dr. King! Morning, Doctor.<br> Can we get<br> a statement, please?<br> Morning.<br> Morning.<br> While rageful violence<br> continues<br> towards the unarmed people<br> of Selma,<br> while they are assaulted<br> with tear gas<br> and batons<br> like an enemy in a war,<br> no citizen of this country<br> can call themselves blameless,<br> for we all bear<br> a responsibility<br> for our fellow man.<br> I am appealing to<br> men and women of God<br> and goodwill everywhere,<br> white, black and otherwise.<br> If you believe all are created<br> equal, come to Selma.<br> Join us. Join our march<br> against injustice<br> and inhumanity.<br> We need you to stand with us.<br> Judge Johnson,<br> Dr. King's call-to-action<br> was nationally televised.<br> We've seen hundreds of people<br> travel across the country<br> to attend tomorrow's march,<br> mostly white,<br> mostly clergy of some kind.<br> The SCLC is seeking<br> a federal court order<br> enjoining<br> the state authorities<br> from interfering<br> with the next march.<br> You're asking me to overturn<br> the Governor's mandate<br> and to do so<br> without a hearing,<br> but it's not<br> going to happen at all<br> without a proper proceeding.<br> Dr. King is in position to<br> lead tomorrow's march, Judge.<br> Understood, but you will have<br> your day in court<br> on Thursday, Mr. Gray.<br> Meanwhile, there will be<br> no march tomorrow.<br> I will not oppose Wallace<br> against protocol.<br> "Thousands head south<br> in moral crusade."<br> The SCLC<br> already filed an appeal<br> against Wallace's orders<br> this morning.<br> You want my advice,<br> Mr. President?<br> You have to ask?<br> Give King<br> the march to Montgomery.<br> Do that, and<br> then Selma's over.<br> Then you're back in control.<br> In control of what?<br> Another civil war?<br> This ain't about<br> the goddamn march.<br> You think he cares<br> about the march?<br> He wants<br> the law changed, now.<br> I've got Congress<br> calling me by the dozens.<br> I've got picketing that gets<br> bigger and bigger every day.<br> He tugs on their goddamn<br> white liberal conscience.<br> Every march pulls 'em.<br> Especially when<br> people are getting<br> beat up in the streets.<br> These pictures are<br> going around the world, Lee.<br> I understand, Mr. President.<br> All the more reason<br> to act now.<br> I'm gonna act now.<br> You tell Wallace<br> and those backwater hicks<br> I don't want to see any more<br> of this horseshit.<br> And you tell King he best not<br> march, you hear me?<br> Either King stops<br> and Wallace stops,<br> or I'll stop 'em both.<br> I'm here on<br> the President's order<br> to try and make this work.<br> Please work with me.<br> So we give up the march<br> and you...<br> You give what?<br> We asked<br> for federal protection.<br> And with no disrespect,<br> but when the<br> Assistant Attorney General<br> is the highest-ranking<br> federal official in Selma,<br> we have our answer.<br> And it's not the one we want.<br> Might I suggest that you<br> speak with Governor Wallace<br> and Sheriff Clark<br> and urge them<br> against violence<br> instead of trying to<br> persuade us<br> not to have<br> a peaceful protest?<br> Maybe we can make a deal.<br> What if I<br> could assure you<br> that the administration<br> would endorse a later march<br> if tomorrow is called off?<br> You know what?<br> He's closer than you may think<br> to coming around<br> on this issue.<br> I believe this compromise<br> might be agreeable.<br> Mr. Doar?<br> Thousands have gathered here<br> to demonstrate their dignity.<br> I don't want to<br> challenge Judge Johnson.<br> I don't want to go<br> against the President.<br> I don't want any of this.<br> The President could stop this<br> with a stroke of his pen.<br> He chooses not to.<br> The decision<br> is with your side, sir,<br> not ours.<br> Good to see you, Father.<br> Good to see you.<br> Thank you for coming.<br> Thank you for coming out.<br> Hello, sister. Good to<br> see you this afternoon.<br> Oh. Oh... You came.<br> You called<br> and we came, my friend.<br> You are not alone, my friend.<br> Welcome, welcome.<br> Hi, what's your name?<br> Susan.<br> Hi, I'm Viola.<br> Welcome to Selma.<br> Yes, ma'am, I'm good.<br> How are you?<br> Fine, thank you.<br> What is your name<br> and where are you from, sir?<br> My name is James Reeb.<br> I've come from Boston.<br> Tell me, why have you<br> traveled here, Mr. Reeb?<br> I heard about the attack<br> of innocent people<br> who just want their rights,<br> and I couldn't<br> just stand by<br> when Dr. King put out<br> that call to clergy.<br> I couldn't.<br> The President doesn't<br> want us to march today.<br> The courts don't want<br> us to march.<br> But we must march.<br> Yeah!<br> We must stand up.<br> Yeah!<br> We must make<br> a massive demonstration<br> of our moral certainty.<br> I'm so glad<br> we're here together today.<br> I thank you for standing up.<br> For we shall be victorious<br> in our quest.<br> We shall cross the finish line<br> hand in hand.<br> For we shall overcome.<br> All right.<br> Troopers, withdraw!<br> My point is, after<br> what happened the last time,<br> if it don't feel right, we<br> don't do it. That's my point.<br> We've been going round<br> and round on this for hours,<br> and nothing's gonna<br> change the fact that<br> it was Doc's decision<br> and we have to support him.<br> This is a movement<br> of many, not of one.<br> So any choice we make<br> has to be right for many.<br> Come on, Diane.<br> Now, you know<br> that's not what I meant<br> by that, all right?<br> People are angry, Dr. King.<br> Angry. They went<br> back to that bridge<br> because they were<br> hot about Sunday.<br> That was our moment<br> out there today.<br> And you threw it away.<br> They could've sealed off<br> the road behind us.<br> No food, water, no kind of<br> support allowed through.<br> We wouldn't<br> have made 10 miles.<br> You saying this was a trap?<br> I don't know what it was.<br> That was no trap!<br> You know why they<br> opened up the road to us?<br> Because all them nice,<br> respectable white folks<br> was with us, and we<br> should've capitalized on that.<br> Because they're not gonna be<br> around here for long.<br> They never are!<br> It was Martin's call.<br> It's done.<br> He made the wrong<br> goddamn call!<br> Hey, watch your mouth,<br> young man!<br> Two days ago,<br> you didn't wanna<br> march at all.<br> And now you're mad because<br> it didn't go the way<br> you planned?<br> Calm down, brother.<br> Now, what happened<br> out there today?<br> You gotta tell us something.<br> Please.<br> I'd rather people be upset<br> and hate me<br> than be bleeding or dead.<br> My dearest Corrie,<br> at a time when I need you,<br> I cannot call you.<br> And I have done this<br> to myself, to us.<br> At this late hour,<br> my thoughts are of you<br> and all you have sacrificed<br> for this struggle.<br> So many have sacrificed.<br> So many have been lost.<br> I wonder how many<br> must we lose.<br> I pray for discernment and<br> guidance as we journey on.<br> I pray, too,<br> that I can justify<br> the faith you once had in me.<br> I, too, often feel that heavy<br> fog you spoke of, Corrie.<br> Only you and our family<br> clears the haze.<br> Love, Martin.<br> He betrayed trust.<br> He called, we came, and he<br> didn't fulfill his own call.<br> Yeah, but sometimes<br> it's not that clear-cut.<br> Sometimes it's instinctual.<br> Like when you're preaching,<br> and you're just flying.<br> You know,<br> you're not on the notes.<br> You're not on memory.<br> You're tapped into<br> what's higher, what's true.<br> God is guiding you.<br> I've known that feeling.<br> It's rare,<br> but I've known it.<br> I think that's<br> what happened to Dr. King<br> up there on the bridge today.<br> He kneeled down,<br> prayed to God<br> and got an answer.<br> And he was brave enough<br> to follow that answer,<br> and I, for one,<br> don't fault him for it.<br> Except he owes me<br> a bus ticket home.<br> You know what<br> I hate more than niggers?<br> What's that?<br> White niggers.<br> Look, we don't<br> want trouble, okay?<br> No, you came here<br> stirrin' trouble.<br> Doc,<br> someone's been hurt.<br> A priest, from Boston.<br> White.<br> Now you know what<br> being a nigger<br> around here<br> feels like, boy.<br> Hurt? How?<br> Dead.<br> I need a phone!<br> Chicago, Detroit, Boston,<br> I don't care.<br> Hell, you got 2,000 people<br> marching up in Harlem.<br> Well, good for you.<br> But when you have people<br> come inside the White House?<br> Inside the White House!<br> On a tour?<br> They just sat down, Martin.<br> They sat down<br> in the main corridor,<br> started singin' and shoutin'.<br> Well, I won't have it!<br> I cannot stop<br> people from expressing...<br> You can! You can stop them.<br> No, you can stop it.<br> You, sir, can do more.<br> Now I'm glad to hear that you<br> called Reverend Reeb's<br> widow, sir.<br> That is very fine,<br> and it is right.<br> I only wish that<br> Jimmie Lee Jackson's family<br> would have received<br> the same consideration<br> from their President.<br> Don't you lay your guilt<br> at my door.<br> You're the one<br> choosing to send<br> people out to slaughter when<br> we told you there was trouble.<br> We won't sit idle<br> while you wait<br> another year or two<br> to send this bill up<br> at your leisure.<br> That should be clear by now.<br> We will continue<br> to demonstrate<br> until you take action, sir.<br> And if our President<br> won't protect our rights,<br> we will take<br> this fight to court.<br> You know, I'm...<br> I'm trying here.<br> We're getting close<br> to figuring something out<br> on this voting thing,<br> but I will not have this!<br> This bill has been<br> almost impossible to craft,<br> you hear me?<br> You think you're jugglin',<br> Martin? I'm jugglin', too.<br> I am a preacher from Atlanta.<br> You are the man<br> who won the presidency<br> of the world's<br> most powerful nation<br> by the greatest landslide<br> in history four months ago.<br> And you are the man<br> dismantling your own legacy<br> with each passing day.<br> No one will remember<br> the Civil Rights Act.<br> But they will remember<br> the standoff in Selma<br> when you never even<br> set foot in this state.<br> They will remember you saying,<br> "Wait," and "I can't,"<br> unless you act, sir.<br> Evenin'.<br> Evenin'.<br> I wanted to speak privately.<br> I know there's been trouble<br> with the group,<br> and I apologize<br> that our efforts<br> have caused a rift<br> between y'all.<br> That's a painful thing,<br> I know,<br> and I'm truly sorry<br> it's happened.<br> Yeah, painful.<br> LBJ is not moving, John.<br> I thought he would, but<br> our efforts are not working,<br> and I can't risk another march<br> with people getting killed<br> when it's not working.<br> I won't do it.<br> We need voting,<br> not marching.<br> You know that.<br> We have to move<br> beyond these protests<br> to some real political power.<br> This can't go on forever<br> like this.<br> I can't go on like this.<br> When I was...<br> When I was working with SNCC<br> on the Freedom Rides,<br> the Montgomery bus<br> reached the city limits.<br> We got off.<br> And out of nowhere,<br> from all directions,<br> they came.<br> There was men, women.<br> Kids, too.<br> They had just about<br> every makeshift weapon<br> you could think of.<br> I mean, bats, bricks,<br> tire irons, pipes.<br> I remember...<br> I remember this little girl<br> just clawing her nails<br> into the side<br> of my friend Jessie's face<br> while her daddy... Her daddy<br> beat him with an ax handle.<br> Jessie was unconscious,<br> and they just kept beating<br> on him and beating on him.<br> I must've passed out<br> on the asphalt somewhere.<br> Next day, I found myself<br> patched up<br> and sitting in a church.<br> I could barely<br> hold my head up,<br> but I needed to be there.<br> You were gonna be speaking.<br> And I needed to hear you.<br> And I was feeling down,<br> but you got up there.<br> You remember that day at all?<br> I don't think we remember it<br> the same way.<br> What'd I say, John?<br> I'm about to tell you<br> right now.<br> And I hope you hear me.<br> You said<br> that we would triumph.<br> That we would triumph<br> because there could be<br> no other way.<br> And you know<br> what else you said?<br> You said,<br> "Fear not.<br> "We've come too far<br> to turn back now."<br> I feel good<br> about where we are.<br> We have a strong case.<br> We can do this.<br> Right.<br> Now, Ms. Cooper<br> and Ms. Boynton are here,<br> and they need to be ready.<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> A lot depends on<br> what they have to say. Okay?<br> Mmm. I hear<br> what you're saying, but...<br> You're here.<br> Yes, I'm here.<br> I'm glad.<br> Just in time.<br> In the matter of<br> the Southern Christian<br> Leadership Conference<br> v. the state of Alabama,<br> I will now hear testimony<br> from the plaintiffs. Mr. Gray.<br> Your Honor, you will hear<br> testimony from the victims<br> who were beaten and bludgeoned<br> in their quest for freedom.<br> For their right to vote<br> and to self-determine.<br> The fact of the matter,<br> Your Honor,<br> is that the incidents that<br> occurred cannot be disputed.<br> These particular circumstances<br> will paint<br> a thorough picture<br> of the horrific events<br> endured in Selma.<br> Very well, you may proceed.<br> Mr. King, you went out<br> on that bridge<br> in direct violation<br> of that judge's orders.<br> You deliberately<br> disobeyed this judge<br> and the Governor,<br> did you not?<br> Thousands of people<br> came to Selma,<br> aroused by Sunday's<br> brutal acts<br> exacted by officials<br> of the city of Selma<br> and the state of Alabama.<br> I felt if I had not<br> led the march,<br> pent-up emotions<br> and inner tensions<br> would have led to<br> an uncontrollable<br> retaliatory situation,<br> a violent situation<br> on both sides.<br> I don't need any of your<br> preaching and prancing<br> in here,<br> you hear?<br> I want an answer.<br> Objection.<br> Watch it, counselor.<br> I'm trying very hard, Judge.<br> Try harder, counselor.<br> It seems basic to<br> our constitutional principles<br> that the extent of<br> the right to assemble,<br> and demonstrate and march<br> along the highway<br> in a peaceful manner<br> ought to be commensurate<br> with the enormity<br> of the wrongs<br> that are being protested<br> and petitioned against.<br> In this case,<br> the wrongs are enormous.<br> Therefore,<br> the extent of the right<br> to demonstrate<br> in an estimated five-day march<br> from Selma to Montgomery<br> has been approved accordingly.<br> Yes!<br> Thank God!<br> There's no further<br> business with this court.<br> These proceedings<br> are concluded,<br> with our thanks<br> to the litigants.<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> Well, now, we don't like<br> to have no mistakes, if you...<br> If you're sure about it.<br> Bayard says that Harry says<br> he can get Nina Simone,<br> Dick Gregory, Joan Baez,<br> Peter, Paul and Mary in.<br> Come on now.<br> We don't got<br> money for that.<br> Well, Harry is chartering<br> a plane himself.<br> Day-O, day-O<br> Daylight come<br> and me wan' go home<br> President's angling<br> for your blocking<br> of the march<br> to be overturned.<br> Unfortunately, all my<br> maneuvers have been<br> put on hold<br> while the matter's<br> being adjudicated.<br> Governor,<br> you wanted to talk.<br> Well, Mr. President...<br> Malcontents are<br> disrupting Alabama,<br> and it's your responsibility<br> to stop them.<br> They're protesting about<br> the right to vote<br> and the way they're treated<br> in your state.<br> So that's your problem,<br> your responsibility,<br> and it's on your watch.<br> Mr. President, I disagree.<br> We have a certain way things<br> are done. It's the way it is.<br> And it's the way<br> the people want it to stay.<br> George, why<br> are you doing this?<br> Your whole career<br> has been working<br> for the poor.<br> Why are you off<br> on this black thing?<br> Well, 'cause you can't<br> ever satisfy them.<br> First, it's the front seat<br> of the bus.<br> Next, it's take over<br> the parks,<br> then it's the<br> public schools,<br> then it's voting,<br> then it's jobs,<br> then it's distribution<br> of wealth without work.<br> George, you seen<br> all those demonstrators<br> out front of<br> the White House<br> keeping my Lady Bird awake<br> the whole damn night?<br> Oh, yes, Mr. President.<br> I saw them.<br> Well, let's go out there,<br> you and I,<br> and announce that<br> you've decided to let<br> the blacks vote undeterred,<br> and this whole mess<br> will go away.<br> And I don't have to draft<br> bills or force the issue.<br> Now, why don't<br> we do that, George?<br> Why don't you just<br> let the niggers vote?<br> You agree they got the right<br> to vote, don't you?<br> Oh, there's no quarrel<br> with that.<br> I know that.<br> That's the law.<br> Then why don't you<br> just let 'em vote?<br> I don't have that power.<br> It belongs to<br> the county registrars.<br> Now, don't shit me<br> about who runs Alabama.<br> I don't have<br> any legal power<br> over the county registrars,<br> Mr. President.<br> They have their regulations<br> and they adhere.<br> Are you trying to shit me,<br> George Wallace?<br> Are you trying<br> to fuck over<br> your President?<br> Mr. President...<br> We shouldn't even<br> be thinking about 1965.<br> We should be thinking<br> about 1985.<br> You and I'll be<br> both dead and gone by then.<br> In 1985, what do you<br> want looking back?<br> You want people<br> remembering you sayin',<br> "Wait," or "I can't,"<br> or, uh, "It's too hard"?<br> I don't right care<br> what they think,<br> and you shouldn't neither.<br> Well...<br> I'll be damned<br> if I'm gonna let history<br> put me in the same place<br> as the likes of you.<br> I speak tonight<br> for the dignity of man<br> and the destiny of democracy.<br> At times, history and fate<br> meet at a single time<br> in a single place.<br> So it was last week<br> in Selma, Alabama.<br> There, long suffering<br> men and women<br> peacefully protested<br> the denial<br> of their rights as Americans.<br> Rarely in any time<br> does an issue lay bare<br> the secret heart<br> of America itself.<br> The issue for equal rights<br> for the American Negro<br> is that issue.<br> For this issue,<br> many of them<br> were brutally assaulted.<br> There is no Negro problem.<br> There is no Southern problem.<br> There is only<br> an American problem.<br> The Constitution says that<br> no person shall be kept<br> from voting<br> because of his race or color.<br> To correct the denial<br> of this fundamental right,<br> this Wednesday,<br> I will send to Congress a law<br> designed to eliminate<br> these illegal barriers.<br> The bill will strike down<br> voting restrictions<br> in all elections,<br> federal, state and local.<br> And we shall do this.<br> We shall overcome.<br> We believe we can cover you<br> through Lowndes County,<br> but once we add<br> the final day's march<br> through Montgomery,<br> and you're passing through<br> all those tall buildings<br> and whatnot,<br> coverage becomes challenging.<br> So please consider<br> driving in on the final leg.<br> And please consider nixing<br> the speech at the Capitol.<br> Well, if Wallace<br> will see us<br> when we arrive,<br> there'll be no need<br> for a speech.<br> Can you arrange that?<br> I can't hide.<br> We can't hide.<br> You understand.<br> I don't want to see this<br> go wrong for you.<br> Don't you want<br> to protect yourself, Doctor?<br> Let me try to do that.<br> You know, I know you<br> want to live to see<br> the fruits of all this work.<br> I know you do.<br> I'm just asking<br> you to allow us<br> to help you do that.<br> I'm no different<br> than anybody else.<br> I want to live long<br> and be happy.<br> But I'll not be focusing<br> on what I want today.<br> I'm focused on<br> what God wants.<br> We're here for a reason,<br> through many, many storms.<br> But, today,<br> the sun is shining,<br> and I'm about to<br> stand in its warmth<br> alongside a lot of<br> freedom-loving people<br> who worked hard<br> to get us here.<br> I may not be with them<br> for all the sunny days<br> to come,<br> but as long as there<br> is light ahead for them,<br> it's worth it to me.<br> Thank you, John.<br> We heard them say<br> we'd never make it here.<br> We heard them say<br> they'd stop us,<br> if it was the<br> last thing they did.<br> We heard them say<br> we don't deserve to be here.<br> But today,<br> we stand as Americans.<br> We are here,<br> and we ain't gonna let nobody<br> turn us around.<br> This mighty march,<br> which will be counted as<br> one of the greatest<br> demonstrations<br> of protest and progress,<br> ends here in the<br> Capitol of Alabama<br> for a vital purpose.<br> We have not fought only<br> for the right to sit<br> where we please<br> and go to school<br> where we please.<br> We do not only strive here<br> today to vote as we please.<br> But with our commitment,<br> we give birth each day<br> to a new energy<br> that is stronger than<br> our strongest opposition.<br> And we embrace<br> this new energy so boldly,<br> embody it so fervently,<br> that its reflection<br> illuminates a great darkness.<br> Our society<br> has distorted who we are.<br> From slavery<br> to the Reconstruction<br> to the precipice<br> at which we now stand,<br> we have seen powerful<br> white men rule the world<br> while offering poor white men<br> a vicious lie as placation.<br> And when the poor<br> white man's children<br> wail with a hunger<br> that cannot be satisfied,<br> he feeds them<br> that same vicious lie.<br> A lie whispering to them<br> that regardless<br> of their lot in life,<br> they can at least be<br> triumphant in the knowledge<br> that their whiteness makes<br> them superior to blackness.<br> But we know the truth.<br> We know the truth, and we will<br> go forward to that truth,<br> to freedom.<br> We will not be stopped.<br> We will march for our rights.<br> We will march to demand<br> treatment as full citizens.<br> We will march until the<br> viciousness and the darkness<br> gives way<br> to the light of righteousness.<br> No man, no myth,<br> no malaise<br> will stop this movement.<br> We forbid it. For we know<br> that it is this darkness<br> that murders the best in us<br> and the best of us.<br> Whether Jimmie Lee Jackson<br> or James Reeb,<br> or four blameless little girls<br> struck down<br> before they had even begun.<br> You may ask, when will we<br> be free of this darkness?<br> I say to you today,<br> my brothers and sisters,<br> despite the pain,<br> despite the tears,<br> our freedom will<br> soon be upon us.<br> For "truth crushed to earth<br> will rise again."<br> When will we be free?<br> Soon, and very soon.<br> Because you shall reap<br> what you sow.<br> When will we be free?<br> Soon, and very soon.<br> Because no lie<br> can live forever.<br> When will we be free?<br> Soon, and very soon<br> because "Mine eyes have seen<br> "the glory of the coming<br> of the Lord.<br> "He is trampling out<br> the vintage<br> "where the grapes of wrath<br> are stored.<br> "He hath loosed<br> the fateful lightning<br> "of his terrible swift sword.<br> "His truth is marching on.<br> "Glory! Hallelujah!<br> "Glory! Hallelujah!<br> "Glory! Hallelujah!<br> "His truth is marching on."<br>
