                        Your son is arrived from London.<br> - Father ...<br> - John ...<br> You will see in my will the estate<br> of Norland was left to me in a way -<br> - that prevents me from dividing it<br> between my two families.<br> Norland, in its entirety,<br> is therefore yours by law.<br> And I am happy for you and Fanny.<br> But your stepmother, my wife and<br> daughters are left only 500 a year.<br> Barely enough to live on.<br> Nothing for the girls' dowries.<br> - You must help them.<br> - Of course.<br> You must promise to do this.<br> I promise, Father.<br> I promise.<br> Help them? What do you mean?<br> I mean to give them 3,000. The<br> interest will be an extra income.<br> - The gift will fulfil my promise.<br> - Without question. More than amply.<br> One had rather. on such occasions.<br> do too much than too little.<br> Of course, he did not stipulate<br> a particular sum.<br> What do you say to 1,500, then?<br> What brother would be so kind to his<br> real sisters. Let alone half-blood?<br> - They can hardly expect more.<br> - What can you afford?<br> better than losing 1,500 at once.<br> Should she live longer than 15 years<br> we'd be completely taken in.<br> People live forever<br> when an annuity is to be paid them.<br> discharge my promise, you're right.<br> I'm convinced that your father<br> had no idea of giving them money.<br> - They will have 500 a year.<br> - What more could they want for?<br> No housekeeping, carriage, horses,<br> few servants, keeping no company ...<br> How comfortable!<br> They will be much more able<br> to give you something.<br> Marianne.<br> can you play something else?<br> Mamma has been weeping<br> since breakfast.<br> I meant something less mournful.<br> A visitor in my own home!<br> It is not to be borne. Elinor.<br> - Mamma, we have nowhere to go.<br> - John and Fanny will be here soon.<br> Do you expect me to be here<br> to welcome them? Vultures!<br> I will start making inquiries<br> for a new house at once.<br> Until then, we must try<br> to bear their coming.<br> Margaret, are you there? Come down,<br> John and Fanny will be here soon.<br> Why are they to live at Norland?<br> They have a house in London.<br> Houses go from father to son, not<br> father to daughter. It is the law.<br> - Come, we'll play with your atlas.<br> - It's not mine. it's their atlas.<br> Do sit down.<br> We are looking for a new home, and<br> can only retain Thomas and Betsy.<br> We're sorry<br> to have to leave you all.<br> But we are certain you will find the<br> new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.<br> My only real concern is how long<br> it will take them to move out.<br> - How is Mrs. Ferrars?<br> - She is always in good health.<br> My brother is with her this season.<br> Quite the most popular bachelor.<br> He has his own barouche.<br> - You have two brothers?<br> - Yes. Edward is the elder.<br> He's travelling up from Plymouth<br> and will break his journey here.<br> - If that is agreeable to you.<br> - Dear John ...<br> This is your home now.<br> - Fanny wants the key to the silver.<br> - What does Fanny want with it?<br> One can presume she wants<br> to count it. What are you doing?<br> Gifts for the servants. Where is<br> Margaret? She's taken to hiding.<br> - At least she can escape Fanny.<br> - You've not said a word to her.<br> I have.<br> I've said yes and no.<br> Good morning, Fanny.<br> Good morning, Miss Marianne.<br> How did you find the silver?<br> Was it all genuine?<br> - When may we expect your brother?<br> - Edward is due tomorrow.<br> He will not stay long. Will Margaret<br> give up her room for him?<br> The view is incomparable, and I<br> want him to see Norland at its best.<br> Mrs. Dashwood.<br> Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.<br> My brother, Edward Ferrars.<br> Do sit down.<br> Where is Miss Margaret? I'm<br> beginning to doubt of her existence.<br> Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest<br> is shy of strangers at present.<br> I am shy of strangers myself,<br> and I have nothing like her excuse.<br> How do you like your view,<br> Mr. Ferrars?<br> Very much. Your stables are handsome<br> and beautifully kept.<br> Stables?<br> Your windows overlook the lake.<br> An error led me to a family room,<br> but I've rectified the situation.<br> I am happily installed<br> in the guest quarters.<br> Tea!<br> They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is<br> always up trees and under furniture.<br> I've barely had a civil word<br> from Marianne.<br> They've just lost their father.<br> Their lives will never be the same.<br> That is no excuse.<br> Library.<br> - These are mostly foreign.<br> - Indeed. Magnificent.<br> I've never liked the smell of books.<br> The dust, perhaps. I hear you have<br> great plans for the walnut grove.<br> I shall have it knocked down<br> to make place for a Grecian temple.<br> That does sound interesting.<br> Would you show me the site?<br> Too expensive, and we do not need<br> four bedrooms. We can share.<br> This one. then.<br> We have only 500 a year.<br> I'll send out more inquiries today.<br> Pardon my intrusion, but I think I<br> have found what you're looking for.<br> Won't you come out?<br> We haven't seen you all day.<br> We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks<br> will help you adjust toyour hours.<br> Forgive me, do you by any chance<br> have a reliable atlas?<br> - I believe so.<br> - I must check the Nile's position.<br> My sister tells me<br> it is in South America.<br> No!<br> No, she's quite wrong.<br> I believe it is in Belgium.<br> Surely not.<br> You must be thinking of the Volga.<br> - The Volga, which starts in ...<br> - In Vladivostok. and ends in ...<br> - Wimbledon.<br> - Yes. where coffee beans come from.<br> The source of the Nile<br> is in Abyssinia.<br> Is it? Interesting.<br> - How do you do? Edward Ferrars.<br> - Margaret Dashwood.<br> It adjoins this property,<br> and would be a desirable addition.<br> - I'll ride there and speak to ...<br> - Gibson.<br> - He'll be pleased enough to sell.<br> - He'll want more than it is worth.<br> Have I hurt you?<br> Thank you.<br> Forgive me.<br> That was my father's favourite.<br> Thank you for helping Margaret.<br> She's changed since you came.<br> I enjoy her company.<br> - Has she shown you the tree house?<br> - Not yet.<br> Would you do me the honour,<br> Miss Dashwood?<br> - It is very fine out.<br> - With pleasure.<br> - Margaret always wanted to travel.<br> - I know. She's off to China soon.<br> I'm to go as her servant, on the<br> understanding I'll be badly treated.<br> - What will your duties be?<br> - Sword fighting and swabbing.<br> Which will take precedence?<br> All I have ever wanted<br> is the quiet of a private life.<br> But my mother is determined<br> to see me distinguished.<br> Orator. Politician. Even a barrister<br> would do. if I drove a barouche.<br> What do you wish for?<br> I prefer the church, but that is not<br> smart enough for my mother.<br> She prefers the army,<br> but that is too smart for me.<br> - Would you stay in London?<br> - I hate London.<br> Country living is my ideal. A small<br> parish where I might do some good.<br> Keep chickens ...<br> Give very short sermons.<br> You feel idle and useless.<br> Imagine how that is compounded -<br> - when one has no choice<br> of any occupation whatsoever.<br> Our circumstances are therefore<br> precisely the same.<br> Except that you will inherit<br> your fortune.<br> We cannot even earnyours.<br> Perhaps Margaret is right.<br> Piracy isyour only option.<br> What is swabbing exactly?<br> "No voice divine the storm allayed.<br> No light propitious shone."<br> 'When snatched from all effectual<br> aid, we perished, each alone."<br> "But l, beneath a rougher sea, and<br> whelmed in deeper gulfs than he ..."<br> No. Edward.<br> '"No voice divine the storm allayed.<br> No light propitious shone."<br> 'When snatched from all effectual<br> aid, we perished, each alone."<br> Can you not feel his despair?<br> Try again.<br> "No voice divine the storm allayed.<br> No light propitious shone."<br> 'When snatched from all effectual<br> aid, we perished, each alone."<br> Mamma ...<br> Look.<br> This has just arrived.<br> "l should be pleased to offer you a<br> home at Barton Cottage, as soon ..."<br> - It's from Sir John Middleton.<br> - Even Elinor must approve the rent.<br> - Has she not yet seen this?<br> - No. I will fetch her.<br> Wait, let us delay.<br> I believe that Edward and Elinor<br> have formed an attachment.<br> It would be cruel to take her away<br> so soon. Devonshire is so far.<br> - Do you disapprove her choice?<br> - By no means.<br> - Edward is very amiable.<br> - Amiable? But ..?<br> There is something wanting.<br> He is too sedate. His reading ...<br> Elinor has not your feelings.<br> Can he love her? Can the soul<br> be satisfied with polite affections?<br> To love is to be on fire.<br> Like Juliet. Guinevere. Heloise.<br> - They made rather pathetic ends.<br> - Pathetic? To die for love?<br> - What could be more glorious?<br> - Your romantic sensibilities ...<br> "Is love a fancy or a feeling? No,<br> it is immortal as immaculate truth."<br> "It is not a blossom shed<br> when outh drops from life's stem."<br> "It grows without water, nor ray of<br> promise cheats the pensive gloom."<br> A pity<br> Edward has no passion for reading.<br> You asked him to read.<br> then you made him nervous.<br> Your behaviour is cordial. You<br> like him in spite of his reading.<br> I think him everything<br> that is amiable and worthy.<br> Praise. indeed.<br> He shall have my devotion when<br> you tell me he is to be my brother.<br> - What shall I do without you?<br> - Without me?<br> I'm sure you will be very happy,<br> but promise you won't live far away.<br> - There is no question of ...<br> - Do you love him?<br> I do not deny that I think<br> very highly of him. That I ...<br> ... greatly esteem him.<br> I like him.<br> Esteem? Like? Use these words again<br> and I shall leave the room!<br> Believe my feelings to be stronger.<br> Further than that. do not believe.<br> Is love a fancy or a feeling?<br> - Or a Ferrars?<br> - Go to bed.<br> "l do not deny<br> that I think very highly of him."<br> "That I ... greatly esteem him."<br> "That I like him."<br> We are so happy<br> that you invited Edward to Norland.<br> We're all very fond of him.<br> We have great hopes for him.<br> Mother expects much of him.<br> And in marriage. She's determined<br> both he and Robert will marry well.<br> But I hope she desires them<br> to marry for love.<br> The heart doesn't always lead us<br> in the most suitable direction.<br> Edward is a compassionate person.<br> Penniless women prey on that type.<br> Having entered into an understanding<br> he would never go back on his word.<br> But it would lead to his ruin.<br> I'm worried. Mother will withdraw<br> all financial support from him -<br> - should he plant affection in less<br> exalted ground than he deserves.<br> I understand you perfectly.<br> Devonshire?<br> My cousin, Sir John Middleton,<br> has offered us a small house.<br> He must be a man of property.<br> He's a widower from Barton Park.<br> It is Barton Cottage he has offered.<br> A cottage? Charming.<br> A cottage is always very snug.<br> You will not leave<br> before the summer?<br> We can no longer trespass<br> upon your sister's goodwill.<br> - You will come and stay with us.<br> - I should like that.<br> Edward has long been expected<br> byyour mother.<br> Come as soon as you can, Edward.<br> Remember, you're always welcome.<br> - Can't you take him with you?<br> - We can't afford him.<br> Perhaps he could make himself useful<br> in the kitchen ... Forgive me.<br> Miss Dashwood ...<br> Elinor ... I must speak to you.<br> There is something of<br> great importance that I need to ...<br> ... tell you ...<br> about my education.<br> - Your education?<br> - Yes.<br> It was conducted.<br> oddly enough, in Plymouth.<br> - Do you know it?<br> - Plymouth? No.<br> I was four years there.<br> In a school run by Mr. Pratt.<br> - Pratt?<br> - Precisely. Pratt.<br> While I was there ...<br> That is to say, he had a ...<br> has a ...<br> You're needed in London<br> this instant.<br> - I'm leaving this afternoon.<br> - Mamma wishes you to leave at once.<br> Excuse me.<br> Edward promised<br> he would bring the atlas to Barton.<br> I'll wager he will do so<br> in less than a fortnight.<br> Dear Edward ...<br> Hello there!<br> Sir John ...<br> Dear ladies!<br> Upon my word! Here you are!<br> - Sir John, your kindness ...<br> - None of that! Hush, please!<br> Here is my dear mamma-in-law,<br> Mrs. Jennings.<br> You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was<br> Your journey tolerable? Poor souls!<br> Why did you not<br> come up to the park first?<br> - We saw you pass.<br> - I made John call the carriage.<br> - She would not wait.<br> - We have so little company.<br> I feel as though I know you already.<br> Delightful creatures!<br> - You'll dine at Barton Park daily.<br> - Dear Sir John. we cannot ...<br> No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.<br> But I insist!<br> Let us settle in.<br> But thank you very much.<br> Send your man up for the carriage<br> as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.<br> Don't thank us.<br> Your feet are cold.<br> What have you been doing?<br> You can grow potatoes in this dirt.<br> It's cold. I'm cold.<br> Where can Brandon be?<br> I hope he's not lamed his horse.<br> Col. Brandon is the most<br> eligible bachelor in the county.<br> He is bound to go for one of you.<br> He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.<br> But I dare say she's left her heart<br> behind in Sussex.<br> I see you, Miss Marianne! I think<br> I've unearthed a secret.<br> You are worse than my best pointer.<br> Is he a butcher. baker. candlestick<br> maker? I'll winkle it out of you.<br> - She's good at winkling.<br> - We've none of us any secrets here.<br> Or if we do.<br> we do not keep them long.<br> - He's curate of the parish.<br> - Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.<br> - Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?<br> - He has no profession.<br> He's a gentleman?<br> - You know there is no such person.<br> - There is. His name begins with F.<br> F? A promising letter.<br> Foster?<br> Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?<br> - Fortescue?<br> - Fondant?<br> Might I play your pianoforte?<br> Yes. of course.<br> - We don't stand on ceremony here.<br> - Please forgive ...<br> I cannot remember when we last<br> had a song in the house.<br> Brandon! Come and meet<br> our beautiful new neighbours.<br> What a pity you're late.<br> You have not heardyour songbird.<br> A great pity.<br> This is my good friend Col. Brandon.<br> We served in the East Indies.<br> - Not a better fellow in the world.<br> - You've been to the East Indies?<br> - What's it like?<br> - Hot.<br> The air is full of spices.<br> Now. Miss Dashwood.<br> it's your turn to entertain us.<br> And I believe I know<br> what key you will sing in.<br> F-major ...<br> You have no right to parade<br> your ignorant assumptions ...<br> - You told me.<br> - I told you nothing.<br> - They'll meet him when he comes.<br> - You don't speak of such things.<br> - Everyone else was.<br> - Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone".<br> I like her. She talks about things.<br> We never talk about things.<br> If you can say nothing appropriate,<br> limit your remarks to the weather.<br> Surely they have enough reeds<br> for a Moses basket.<br> You know what they're saying?<br> Word is, you've developed a taste<br> for certain company. And why not?<br> A man like you in his prime ...<br> She'd be a fortunate young lady.<br> Marianne Dashwood would<br> no more think of me than of you.<br> - Don't think of yourself so meanly.<br> - And all the better for her.<br> Besotted ... An excellent match.<br> - He's rich and she's handsome.<br> - How long have you known him?<br> As long as I've been here,<br> and I came 15 years back.<br> His estate is but four miles hence.<br> He and John are very thick.<br> He has no wife and children.<br> He had a tragic history.<br> He loved a ward to the family.<br> They were not permitted to marry.<br> - On what grounds?<br> - Eliza was poor.<br> She was flung out of the house,<br> and he was packed off to the army.<br> I think he'd have done himself harm<br> if not for John.<br> - What became of the lady?<br> - She was passed from man to man.<br> She disappeared from good society.<br> When Brandon returned from India<br> he searched and searched. -<br> - only to find her dying<br> in a poorhouse.<br> I thought my daughter Charlotte<br> might have cheered him up.<br> Look at him now!<br> So attentive!<br> - I should try a little experiment.<br> - Please. Let the colonel alone.<br> All suitors need a little help.<br> - We haven't heard you play of late.<br> - You have a superior musician here.<br> Brandon shares your passion for<br> music. He plays the pianoforte well.<br> You know as many melancholy tunes<br> as Miss Marianne.<br> You must play us a duet.<br> Let us see you both side by side.<br> I do not know any duets.<br> Forgive me, Colonel.<br> Will we never have peace? The rent<br> is low. but it comes on hard terms.<br> Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but<br> marry off everyone else's daughters.<br> There's a parcel arrived.<br> Look!<br> When is a man safe from such wit.<br> if infirmity does not protect him?<br> If he is infirm.<br> then I am at death's door.<br> - He complained of rheumatism.<br> - "A slight ache" was his phrase.<br> Edward said<br> he would bring it himself.<br> "lt gives me great pleasure to<br> restore this atlas to its owner."<br> "Business prevents my delivering it,<br> which will hurt me more than you."<br> "Memories of your kindness must<br> sustain me. and I remain -<br> - your devoted servant,<br> E.C. Ferrars."<br> - Why hasn't he come?<br> - He says he's busy, dear.<br> - He said he'd come. Why hasn't he?<br> - I'm taking you for a walk.<br> - It is going to rain.<br> - It is not going to rain.<br> I fear<br> Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.<br> - You must miss him. Elinor.<br> - We are not engaged, Mamma.<br> - But he loves you, dearest.<br> - I am by no means assured of that.<br> And had he such a preference,<br> there would certainly be obstacles -<br> - to his marrying a woman of no rank<br> who cannot afford to buy sugar.<br> - But your heart must tell you ...<br> - It is better to use one's head.<br> - It can't be good for me.<br> - It is. Stop complaining.<br> - It's giving me a cough.<br> - It is not giving you a cough.<br> It's lovely. Come on, catch up!<br> - Over there is a field of rabbits.<br> - I don't want to see rabbits.<br> - Is anything superior to this?<br> - I told you it would rain.<br> - Blue sky! Let us chase it!<br> - I'm not supposed to run.<br> Are you hurt?<br> - I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.<br> - I will run as fast as I can.<br> Margaret!<br> Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.<br> - Are you hurt?<br> - Only my ankle.<br> May I have your permission to<br> ascertain if there are any breaks?<br> It is not broken.<br> Can you put your arm about my neck?<br> Allow me to escort you home.<br> At last!<br> She fell down and he's carrying her!<br> Marianne, are you hurt?<br> It's a twisted ankle.<br> It's not serious.<br> I felt the bone. and it's sound.<br> - I cannot begin to thank you.<br> - Do not think of it.<br> - Will you not be seated?<br> - I'd leave a water mark.<br> - But permit me to call tomorrow.<br> - We shall look forward to it.<br> I'll show you out.<br> Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.<br> - His name!<br> - To whom are we so much obliged?<br> John Willoughby of Allenham<br> at your service.<br> John Willoughby of Allenham ...<br> What an impressive gentleman!<br> He lifted me as if I weighed no more<br> than a dried leaf.<br> - Tell me if I hurt you.<br> - She feels no pain, Mamma.<br> Margaret, ask Betsy to make up<br> a cold compress.<br> Please don't say anything important.<br> - He expressed himself well.<br> - With decorum and honour.<br> - And spirit and wit and feeling.<br> - And economy. Ten words at most.<br> - Change, or you'll catch a cold.<br> - What care I for colds?<br> - You'll care when your nose swells.<br> - You're right. Help me.<br> He's worth catching. Marianne must<br> not have all the men to herself.<br> - But what do you know of him?<br> - There's not a bolder rider.<br> But what are his tastes.<br> his passions, his pursuits?<br> - He has a smart little pointer ...<br> - Where is Allenham?<br> Nice little estate three miles east.<br> He is to inherit it from a relative.<br> Lady Allen is the name.<br> It's Col. Brandon.<br> I should go out and keep watch.<br> You're looking out for Willoughby.<br> You'll not think of Brandon now.<br> Come in.<br> Good morning, Brandon.<br> - How is the invalid?<br> - Thank you so much, Colonel.<br> Why set your cap at Willoughby when<br> you've already made such a conquest?<br> I'll not set my cap at anyone.<br> - Lady Allen's nephew?<br> - He visits. for he's to inherit.<br> He has a pretty estate of his own.<br> Combe Magna in Somerset.<br> I'd not give him up to a younger<br> sister for tumbling down hills.<br> The man himself. Come. Brandon.<br> We know when we are not wanted.<br> Thank you so much for calling.<br> Marianne. the colonel and Sir John<br> are leaving.<br> Goodbye.<br> Thank you for the flowers.<br> - How do you do, Colonel?<br> - How do you do, more like.<br> - Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!<br> - The pleasure is all mine.<br> - Miss Marianne has not caught cold?<br> - You've found out my name.<br> The area is crawling with my spies.<br> You cannot venture out to nature ...<br> - So nature must be brought to you.<br> - How beautiful.<br> - These are not from the hothouse.<br> - Mine is not the first offering.<br> - They come from an obliging field.<br> - I always prefer wild flowers.<br> - Would you ..?<br> -your gratitude is beyond words.<br> I've grieved for this lonely house.<br> Then I heard it was taken.<br> I felt an interest which nothing can<br> account for but my present delight.<br> Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.<br> Who is reading<br> Shakespeare's sonnets?<br> - Marianne is reading them out.<br> - And which are your favourites?<br> Mine is 1 16.<br> "Let me not to the marriage<br> of true minds admit impediments."<br> "Love is not love which alters<br> when it alteration finds. -<br> - or bends with the remover<br> to remove ..."<br> - How does it continue?<br> - "No. it is an ever fixed mark ..."<br> - "That looks on tempests..."<br> - Is it "tempests"?<br> It's strange you are reading these.<br> I carry them with me always.<br> Until tomorrow then ...<br> My pocket sonnets are yours.<br> A talisman against further injury.<br> Goodbye. Thank you.<br> Good work. Marianne. You covered<br> Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.<br> When you know his views on romance,<br> you'll have nothing left to talk of.<br> I suppose I erred against decorum.<br> I should have talked of the weather.<br> Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt<br> of your enthusiasm for him.<br> Should I hide my regard?<br> - No. but we know so little of him.<br> - Time does not determine intimacy.<br> Seven years is too little for some,<br> seven days is enough for others.<br> - Or seven hours. in this case.<br> - I feel I know him already.<br> Had I more shallow feelings, I could<br> perhaps conceal them as you do.<br> - I'm sorry ...<br> - Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.<br> I do not understand her.<br> Marianne ...<br> - Haven't you finished yet?<br> - No. Patience.<br> You're not going to deny us<br> beef as well as sugar?<br> - There is nothing under ten pence.<br> - Do you want us to starve?<br> No.<br> Just not to eat beef.<br> If my behaviour was improper,<br> I should be sensible of it.<br> It has caused impertinent remarks.<br> Do you not doubt your discretion?<br> If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove<br> impropriety, we are all offending.<br> Good morning, Colonel.<br> Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.<br> I come to issue an invitation.<br> A picnic on my estate<br> at Delaford.<br> If you would care to join us<br> on Thursday next.<br> Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband<br> are travelling up especially.<br> We should be delighted, Colonel.<br> I will, of course, be including<br> Mr. Willoughby in the party.<br> I should be delighted to join you.<br> Good morning, Miss Dashwood.<br> Good morning, Colonel.<br> The colonel has invited us<br> to Delaford.<br> - I hear you have a fine pianoforte.<br> - A Broadwood Grand.<br> - Then I shall play for you all.<br> - We shall look forward to it.<br> - Your sister seems very happy.<br> - She does not hide her emotions.<br> Her romantic prejudices<br> tend to set propriety at naught.<br> - She is wholly unspoilt.<br> - Rather too unspoilt.<br> The sooner she is acquainted with<br> the ways of the world, the better.<br> I knew a lady with the same<br> sweetness of temper -<br> - who was forced into a<br> better acquaintance with the world.<br> The result was only<br> ruination and despair.<br> Do not desire it. Miss Dashwood.<br> Col. Brandon's lawn<br> is perfect for kite launching.<br> Mind the pretty ribbons.<br> Imagine my surprise when Charlotte<br> and her master appeared with Lucy.<br> The last person I expected to see.<br> She came to join in the fun.<br> There is no such luxury at home.<br> I'd not seen you for so long.<br> You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods<br> she wanted to see.<br> I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"<br> for I don't know how long.<br> What do you think of them? My mother<br> wrote of little else in her letters.<br> - Are they not as she described?<br> - Nothing like.<br> You are quite rude today.<br> He's to be an MP. and he is forced<br> to make everybody like him.<br> - I said nothing so irrational.<br> - Mr. Palmer's so droll.<br> Here he comes!<br> Now you shall see, Charlotte.<br> Hello, Mr. Willoughby!<br> You must meet my daughter Charlotte,<br> and Mr. Palmer.<br> - Andyour cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.<br> - Welcome toyour party.<br> May I sit beside you?<br> I've longed to meet you. I've heard<br> nothing but praise for you.<br> Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are<br> too excessive in their compliments.<br> The praise came from another source.<br> One not inclined to exaggeration.<br> What can this be?<br> Is Col. Brandon here?<br> - My horse!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I must away to London.<br> - Impossible!<br> We can't picnic withoutyour host.<br> Come up to town tomorrow.<br> - Or wait until we return.<br> - I can't afford to lose one minute.<br> - Forgive me.<br> - I hope it's nothing serious.<br> Upon my soul,<br> this is all very unusual.<br> - Frailty, thy name is Brandon.<br> - Some cannot bear pleasure.<br> You are a wicked pair.<br> Col. Brandon will be missed.<br> Why? Everyone speaks well of him,<br> but no one remembers to talk to him.<br> Nonsense. He is highly respected<br> at Barton Park.<br> - Which is enough censure in itself.<br> - Really, Willoughby.<br> Come, come, Mr. Impudence.<br> I know your wicked ways.<br> Reveal your beau. No secrets between<br> friends. I'll winkle it out of you.<br> I'll have you married to the colonel<br> by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.<br> - As if you could marry him.<br> - Why should you dislike him?<br> Because he threatened me with rain<br> when I wanted it fine.<br> He found fault with my high flyer<br> and will not buy my brown mare.<br> If it will be<br> of satisfaction to you, -<br> - I believe his character to be. in<br> all other respects, irreproachable.<br> In return for this acknowledgement,<br> don't deny me the privilege -<br> - of disliking him<br> as much as I adore ...<br> ... this cottage.<br> - I have plans for improvements.<br> - That. I will never consent to.<br> Not a stone must be added<br> to its walls.<br> Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild<br> Combe Magna to this exact image.<br> - With a fire that smokes?<br> - Especially the fire that smokes.<br> Then I'd be as happy at Combe<br> as I've been at Barton.<br> But this place has one claim on<br> my affections none other can share.<br> Promise never to change it.<br> I'm honoured you risk your honour by<br> seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.<br> - That is what Elinor would say.<br> - And she would be right.<br> Miss Marianne, will you grant me<br> an interview tomorrow ... alone?<br> - Willoughby, we are always alone.<br> - But there is ...<br> There is something very particular<br> I should like to ask you.<br> Of course. I shall ask Mamma<br> if I may stay behind from church.<br> Thank you.<br> Until tomorrow. then.<br> Oh. Virtue ...<br> Silently and with fear, enter the<br> hearts of all that hear me this day.<br> Will he kneel down when he asks her?<br> They always kneel down.<br> What is wrong, dearest?<br> Willoughby?<br> What is the matter?<br> Forgive me ...<br> I am sent ...<br> Lady Allen exercised the privilege<br> of riches upon a dependent cousin.<br> - She is sending me to London.<br> - This morning?<br> What a disappointment. Your business<br> won't detain you for long, I hope?<br> You are kind. but I have no idea of<br> returning immediately to Devonshire.<br> - I am invited only once a year.<br> - Can you wait foryour invitation?<br> My engagements are of such a<br> nature ... I dare not flatter my ...<br> It's folly to linger in this manner.<br> I will not torment myself further.<br> Willoughby, come back!<br> Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea<br> for Marianne.<br> - What is wrong, my love?<br> - Do not ask me questions.<br> - They must have quarrelled.<br> - That is unlikely.<br> Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves<br> of his regard for Marianne.<br> - An excuse to send him away.<br> - Then why did he not say so?<br> - It's not like him to be secretive.<br> - What do you suspect?<br> - Why was his manner so guilty?<br> - You think he's been acting a part?<br> - No. He loves her. I am sure.<br> - Of course!<br> Has he left her any assurance<br> of his return?<br> Ask if he proposed.<br> No! I cannot force a confidence<br> from Marianne. Neither should you.<br> We must trust her to confide in us<br> in her own time.<br> There was something underhand<br> in his manner.<br> You will think the worst of him.<br> I give him the benefit of my<br> good opinion. He deserves no less.<br> I am very fond of Willoughby.<br> Mamma ... Mamma!<br> She would not let me in.<br> - If only this rain would stop.<br> - If only youwould stop.<br> 'Twas you took her off my hands,<br> Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.<br> Now I have the whip hand over you,<br> for you cannot give her back.<br> Marianne, play with us. Looking at<br> the weather will not bring him back.<br> - She ate nothing at dinner.<br> - We're all forlorn these days.<br> Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now<br> we might haveyour ... discussion.<br> -your discussion?<br> - I've longed to ask you something.<br> You might think me impertinent.<br> It is an odd question.<br> If only he'd gone to Combe Magna.<br> We live but half a mile away.<br> - Five and a half.<br> - I cannot believe it is that far.<br> - I can't believe it.<br> - Try.<br> You may ask any manner of question<br> if that is of any help.<br> Are you acquainted with your<br> sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?<br> Fanny's mother?<br> No. I have never met her.<br> You must think me strange to ask.<br> If only I dared tell ...<br> If she tells you of the famous<br> Mr. F, you must pass it on.<br> Will you take a turn with me,<br> Miss Dashwood?<br> I had no idea you were at all<br> connected with that family.<br> I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars<br> at present.<br> But the time may come when we<br> may be very intimately connected.<br> What do you mean?<br> Do you have an understanding<br> with Fanny's brother Robert?<br> The youngest? No.<br> I have never met him in my life.<br> - With Edward.<br> - Edward Ferrars?<br> Edward and I have been<br> secretly engaged these five years.<br> You may well be surprised.<br> I only mention it because I entirely<br> trust you to keepyour secret.<br> Edward looks on you<br> quite as his own sister.<br> I am sorry.<br> Surely we ...<br> We surely do not mean<br> the same Mr. Ferrars.<br> Yes. He was under the tutelage<br> of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.<br> - Has he never spoken of it?<br> - Yes ... Yes. I believe he has.<br> I wanted his mother's approval,<br> but we loved each other so much.<br> You must have seen how capable he is<br> of making a woman attached to him.<br> I cannot pretend it has not<br> been hard on both of us.<br> We can scarcely meet<br> above twice a year.<br> You seem out of sorts.<br> Are you quite well?<br> - I have not offended you?<br> - I must know what you are saying.<br> - Promise me you'll not tell a soul.<br> - Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.<br> I give you my word.<br> - What has so fascinated you?<br> - Tell us all!<br> - We were talking of London.<br> - Do you hear that, Charlotte?<br> - Charlotte and I concocted a plan.<br> - The best plan in the world!<br> I make for London shortly,<br> and I invite you, Lucy, -<br> - and both the Misses Dashwood<br> to join me.<br> Can I go?<br> You will all come to my Chelsea home<br> and taste of the season's delights.<br> Please, can I go?<br> - Do you not long for it to be so?<br> - I came here with no other view.<br> - We can't leave our mother.<br> - She can spare you very well.<br> - Of course she can!<br> - I could not be more delighted.<br> I will brook no refusal.<br> Let us strike hands on the bargain.<br> If I don't have you married by<br> Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.<br> I've never been so grateful.<br> I shall see Willoughby,<br> and you will see Edward.<br> - Are you asleep?<br> - With you in the room?<br> You can't feel as calm as you look.<br> Oh, I will never sleep tonight.<br> What were you and Miss Steele<br> talking about so long?<br> Nothing of significance.<br> How do you think I like poking about<br> in that big house without Charlotte?<br> I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know<br> how much I may see of him.<br> Secrecy is vital.<br> He'll never be able to call.<br> My only comfort has been<br> the constancy of his affection.<br> You're fortunate never to have had<br> any doubts on that score.<br> I am of a jealous nature. Had he<br> talked more of one young woman ...<br> But he's not given a moment's alarm<br> on that count.<br> Imagine how glad he'll be<br> to learn that we are friends.<br> - Have you missed me, Pigeon?<br> - Very much, ma'am.<br> - Is everything in order?<br> - I suggest the ordering of coal.<br> There you are, Pooter.<br> Still alive, I see ... Tea, Pigeon.<br> You do not waste any time.<br> Give it to Pigeon.<br> Mrs. Jennings says your sister will<br> buy her wedding clothes in town.<br> John and Fanny are in town.<br> We should be forced to see them.<br> I think it was for next door.<br> Sit down for two seconds.<br> You're making me nervous.<br> Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.<br> Indeed it is.<br> Excuse me. Colonel.<br> Colonel ...<br> What a pleasure to see you. Have you<br> been in London all this while?<br> What a pleasure to see you. Have you<br> been in London all this while?<br> I have heard<br> reports through town ...<br> Tell me once and for all:<br> Is everything resolved between<br> your sister and Mr. Willoughby?<br> Though neither one has informed me<br> of their understanding, -<br> - I have no doubt<br> of their mutual affection.<br> Thank you, Miss Dashwood.<br> To your sister<br> I wish all imaginable happiness.<br> To Mr. Willoughby, that<br> he may endeavour to deserve her.<br> What do you mean?<br> Forgive me ...<br> Forgive me.<br> - Where is dear Edward. John?<br> - And who is Edward?<br> My brother.<br> Mr. Edward Ferrars.<br> Ferrars with an F?<br> Are there any messages?<br> No message at all? No cards?<br> - You do not ask for your messages.<br> - No, for I do not expect any.<br> I have<br> very little acquaintance in town.<br> Not another word about the ham bone.<br> You and Cartwright sort it out.<br> - No messages.<br> - Do not fret, my dear.<br> This good weather is keeping<br> many a sportsman in the country.<br> But the frost will soon<br> drive them to town. Depend on it.<br> I had not thought of that.<br> And Miss Dashwood<br> may set her heart at rest, -<br> - for your sister-in-law is inviting<br> Mr. F to the ball tonight.<br> Do be careful.<br> the horses have been here.<br> Do be careful.<br> the horses have been here.<br> It is beginning to rain also.<br> Follow me.<br> Mamma!<br> This is very merry!<br> - Do you spy anyone we know?<br> - No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.<br> - Do you see anyone we know?<br> - Unfortunately not.<br> How can you be such a tease?<br> There is Mrs. John Dashwood.<br> Come along, my dears.<br> There you are!<br> How hot it is ...<br> You are not alone. I trust?<br> John is just gone<br> to fetch my brother.<br> Your brother! I declare.<br> this is good news, indeed.<br> I shall faint clean away.<br> Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased<br> to meet you. My brother-in-law ...<br> Mr. Robert Ferrars.<br> Miss Dashwood.<br> Miss Steele. Miss Marianne.<br> My dear ladies, we meet at last.<br> You must be the younger brother.<br> Is Mr. Edward not here?<br> - Miss Dashwood was counting on him.<br> - He is far too busy.<br> There's no special acquaintance here<br> to make his attendance worthwhile.<br> What are the men about these days?<br> Are they in hiding?<br> In the absence of your brother<br> you must dance with Miss Dashwood.<br> It would be my honour.<br> Perhaps Miss Steele might consider<br> reserving the allemande?<br> You reside in Devonshire.<br> Miss Dashwood!<br> - In a cottage!<br> - Yes.<br> I am excessively fond of a cottage.<br> If I had any money to spare,<br> I should build one myself.<br> Mr. Willoughby ...<br> - How do you do, Miss Dashwood?<br> - Very well.<br> - How is your family?<br> - We are all extremely well.<br> Thank You for your kind inquiry.<br> Willoughby!<br> Good God, Willoughby ...<br> Will you not shake hands with me?<br> How do you do, Miss Marianne?<br> What is the matter?<br> Why have you not come to see me?<br> Were you not in London?<br> Have you not received my letters?<br> I had the pleasure of receiving<br> the information you sent to me.<br> For heaven's sake, Willoughby,<br> tell me what is wrong.<br> Thank you. I am most obliged.<br> Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.<br> Go to him.<br> Force him to come to me instantly.<br> You must come away.<br> - Do you know them?<br> - Acquaintances from the country.<br> Come away, dearest.<br> I do not understand.<br> I must speak to him ...<br> My goodness. Come, dear.<br> You need some air.<br> Lucy!<br> We must go.<br> It would be your pleasure<br> to escort your young charge home.<br> How kind.<br> She actually sent him messages<br> during the night<br> - Marianne, please tell me.<br> - Do not ask me questions.<br> - You have no confidence in me.<br> - You confide in no one.<br> - I have nothing to tell.<br> - We neither of us do.<br> I, because I conceal nothing. You,<br> because you communicate nothing.<br> Lady Charter is ought to limit her<br> invitation list. It was very warm.<br> I am glad we left early.<br> There now ...<br> Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.<br> That letter will do the trick.<br> I must be off. I do hope he doesn't<br> keep her waiting much longer.<br> It hurts to see her this way.<br> What a welcome I had<br> from Edward's family.<br> You never said how agreeable<br> your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.<br> It is fortunate that none of them<br> knows of your engagement.<br> "'Dear Madam. I am at a loss to see<br> how I might have offended you."<br> "lf I have given rise to a belief of<br> more than I meant to express, -<br> - I regret<br> not having been more guarded."<br> "My affections<br> are engaged elsewhere."<br> "It is with regret that I return<br> your letters and the lock of hair."<br> "l am, et cetera, John Willoughby."<br> Dearest ...<br> It is better than if your engagement<br> had carried on before he ended it.<br> We're not engaged.<br> I thought he left you<br> with some kind of understanding.<br> - He's not so unworthy as you think.<br> - Did he tell you that he loved you?<br> Yes. No ... Never absolutely.<br> It was implied but never declared.<br> Sometimes I thought it had been,<br> but it never was. He broke no vow.<br> He made us all believe he loved you.<br> He did! He loved me as I loved him.<br> I had to come straight up.<br> How are you, Miss Marianne?<br> Poor thing, she looks very bad.<br> No wonder. for it is but too true.<br> I was told by Miss Morton, -<br> - that he is soon to marry<br> a Miss Grey with 50,000!<br> If true, he is a good-for-nothing<br> who used my young friend ill.<br> And I wish with all my soul that his<br> wife might plague all his heart out.<br> He's not the only young man<br> worth having.<br> With your pretty face<br> You'll never want for admirers.<br> Better let her have her cry out<br> and have done with it.<br> I will go look out something<br> to tempt her.<br> - Does she care for olives?<br> - I cannot tell you.<br> Apparently, they never were engaged.<br> Miss Grey has 50,000.<br> Marianne is virtually penniless.<br> She couldn't expect him to go<br> through with it. But I feel for her.<br> She will lose her bloom<br> and end a spinster like Elinor.<br> We might have them to stay for a<br> few days. We are, after all, family.<br> - And my father ...<br> - My love ...<br> I would ask them with all my heart,<br> but I've already asked Miss Steele.<br> And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings<br> of all her company.<br> We can invite your sisters<br> some other year.<br> Miss Steele will profit more<br> from your generosity, poor girl.<br> Excellent notion.<br> Colonel Brandon to see you.<br> - Thank you so much for coming.<br> - How is your sister?<br> I must get her home. Palmer can take<br> us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.<br> - I'll take you to Barton myself.<br> - I confess, that is what I hoped.<br> Marianne suffers cruelly.<br> What pains me most is how hard<br> she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.<br> Perhaps ...<br> Ma I relate some circumstances<br> which only a desire to be useful ...<br> You have something to tell me<br> of Mr. Willoughby?<br> When I quitted Barton last ...<br> No, I must go further back.<br> No doubt ...<br> No doubt ...<br> ... Mrs. Jennings has appraised you<br> of certain events in my past.<br> The sad outcome of my connection<br> with a young woman named Eliza.<br> What is not commonly known -<br> - is that 20 years ago,<br> before she died. Eliza bore a child.<br> The father. whoever he was.<br> abandoned them.<br> As Eliza lay dying, she begged me<br> to look after the child.<br> I had failed her in ever other way,<br> I could not refuse her now.<br> I placed the child, Beth,<br> with a family in the country -<br> - where I knew she would be looked<br> after. I saw her whenever I could.<br> She grew up so headstrong, -<br> - and, God forgive me,<br> I allowed her too much freedom.<br> Almost a year ago she disappeared.<br> I instigated a search, but for<br> eight months I imagined the worst.<br> On the day of the Delaford picnic,<br> I received the first news of her.<br> She was ... with child.<br> And the blackguard who had left her<br> with no hint of his whereabouts ...<br> Do you mean Willoughby?<br> Before I could confront him.<br> Lady Allen had turned him out.<br> - He fled to London.<br> - He left without any explanation.<br> He risked losing the estate, and the<br> money that remained to his debtors.<br> So he abandoned Marianne -<br> - for Miss Grey<br> and her 50.000.<br> Is Beth still in town?<br> She has chosen to go to the country<br> for her confinement.<br> I would not burden you,<br> had I not, from my heart, -<br> - believed it might, in time,<br> lessen our sister's regrets.<br> I have described Mr. Willoughby<br> as the worst of libertines.<br> But I learned from Lady Allen that<br> he did mean to propose that day.<br> I cannot deny that his intentions<br> towards Marianne were honourable.<br> I feel certain<br> that he would have married her.<br> - Had it not been ...<br> - For the money.<br> - Was I right to tell you?<br> - Of course.<br> Whatever his past actions,<br> whatever his present course, -<br> - you may be certain<br> that he loved you.<br> But not enough.<br> Not enough ...<br> Here is someone to cheer you up.<br> How is your dear sister?<br> Poor thing.<br> I do not know what I'd do if a man<br> treated me with so little respect.<br> Are you enjoying your stay<br> with John and Fanny?<br> I was never so happy in my life.<br> Your sister-in-law has taken to me.<br> - You cannot imagine what happened.<br> - No. I cannot.<br> Yesterday I was introduced to his<br> mother. She was more than civil.<br> I have not yet seen Edward,<br> but I feel sure to, very soon.<br> There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars<br> to see you.<br> Do ask him to come in.<br> What a pleasure to see you.<br> You know Miss Steele. of course.<br> - How do you do, Miss Steele?<br> - I am well, thank you.<br> Do sit down.<br> Are you surprised to find me here<br> and not at your sister's house?<br> Let me fetch Marianne. She would be<br> disappointed to miss you.<br> Edward! I heard your voice.<br> - At last you found us.<br> - My visit is shamefully overdue.<br> - You're pale. Are you not well?<br> - Don't think of me. Elinor is well.<br> - That is enough for both of us.<br> - How do you enjoy London?<br> The sight of you is all the pleasure<br> it has afforded. Is that not so?<br> - Why have you not visited before?<br> - I have been engaged elsewhere.<br> But what was that when there were<br> such friends to be met?<br> Perhaps you think young men<br> never honour their engagements<br> Edward is the most incapable of<br> being selfish of anyone I ever saw.<br> Edward, will you not sit?<br> Help me to persuade him.<br> - Forgive me. I must take m leave.<br> - You are only just arrived.<br> I've an urgent commission for Fanny.<br> Perhaps you might escort me<br> back to your sister's house.<br> It would be an honour.<br> - Why did you not urge him to stay?<br> - He must have had his reasons.<br> Yes, your coldness. Were I Edward,<br> I'd assume you didn't care for me.<br> Marianne looked badly. It makes me<br> fear that I shall never marry.<br> Nonsense. You will marry far better<br> than the Dashwood girls.<br> But I have no dowry.<br> There are other important qualities<br> that you have in abundance.<br> It would not surprise me if you<br> married beyond your expectations.<br> Oh, I wish that might be so.<br> There is a young man ...<br> Is he of good fortune and breeding?<br> Of both. But his family<br> would certainly oppose the match.<br> They will allow it<br> as soon as they see you.<br> It is a very great secret.<br> I've told nobody in the world<br> for fear of discovery.<br> - I am the soul of discretion.<br> - If I dared tell ...<br> I can assure you,<br> I am as silent as the grave.<br> Viper in my bosom!<br> Stop this!<br> What a commotion! Edward Ferrars.<br> the one I used to joke you about, -<br> - is engaged these five years<br> to Lucy Steele.<br> His mother has demanded he break the<br> engagement or suffer disinheritance.<br> But he refuses to break his promise.<br> He has stood by her, -<br> - and is cut off without a penny.<br> She settled it all on Mr. Robert.<br> I must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law<br> drove her to hysteria.<br> How long have you known?<br> - Since Mrs. Jennings invited us.<br> - Why did you not tell me?<br> Lucy told me in confidence.<br> - I could not break my word.<br> - He loves you!<br> - He tried to tell me about Lucy.<br> - He cannot marry her.<br> Should he treat her worse<br> than Willoughby treated you?<br> - He can't marry without love.<br> - He promised a long time ago.<br> He may harbour some regret, but he<br> he will be happy he kept his word.<br> It is bewitching to think one's<br> happiness depends on one person, -<br> - but it is not always possible.<br> We must accept.<br> Edward will marry Lucy,<br> and you and I will go home.<br> Always resignation and acceptance.<br> Always prudence and honour and duty.<br> Elinor, where is your heart?<br> What do you know of my heart,<br> or anything but your own suffering?<br> For weeks this has been pressed<br> on me, when I could not speak of it.<br> Forced on me by the person whose<br> prior claims ruined all my hopes.<br> I endured her exaltation, knowing<br> I was divided from Edward forever.<br> If not bound to silence. I'd have<br> produced proof of a broken heart.<br> I have heard your Mr. Ferrars<br> has lost his fortune to his brother.<br> - Have I been rightly informed?<br> - It is indeed so.<br> - Are you acquainted with him?<br> - No. we have never met.<br> But I know only too well<br> the cruelty ...<br> ... of dividing two young people<br> long attached to one another.<br> I have a proposal that may allow him<br> to marry Miss Steele immediately.<br> As he is a friend to your family,<br> perhaps you'd mention it to him.<br> I'm sure he'd be delighted<br> to hear it from your own lips.<br> I think not.<br> His behaviour has proved him proud.<br> In the best sense.<br> I feel certain<br> this is the right course.<br> Mr. Edward Ferrars.<br> Thank you for responding so quickly.<br> I was grateful<br> to receive your message.<br> God knows what you must think of me.<br> - I have no right to speak...<br> - I have good news.<br> Do please sit down.<br> - You know of Col. Brandon.<br> - I've heard his name.<br> Col. Brandon desires me to say,<br> as you wish to join the clergy, -<br> - that he has pleasure in offering<br> you the parish at Delaford, -<br> - in the hope it may enable<br> you and Miss Steele to marry.<br> - Col. Brandon!<br> - Yes.<br> He means it as testimony of his<br> concern for this cruel situation.<br> Col. Brandon give me a parish!<br> Can it be possible?<br> You shouldn't be astonished to find<br> friendship outside your family.<br> No.<br> Not to find it in you.<br> I cannot be ignorant that it is<br> certainly to you that I owe this.<br> I'd express it if I could,<br> but I am no orator ...<br> You are mistaken.<br> You owe it to your own merit.<br> Col. Brandon must be a man<br> of great worth.<br> He is the kindest and best of men.<br> May I ask why the colonel<br> did not tell me himself?<br> I think he felt it would be better<br> coming from a friend.<br> Your friendship has been<br> the most important in my life.<br> You will always have it.<br> Forgive me.<br> You honour your promises. That is<br> more important than anything else.<br> I wish you both happiness.<br> What luck for them<br> to find a parish so close to Barton.<br> You'll all be able to meet<br> very often.<br> I've never disliked a person so much<br> as I do Mr. Willoughby.<br> We can see his house from the hill!<br> I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.<br> You won't.<br> I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown<br> was everything of the finest ...<br> Mrs. Bunting!<br> We're in desperate need of tea.<br> She's not drawn breath since London.<br> Had I only found another way home.<br> There was no other way. I'll just<br> take a stroll. A moment's peace.<br> - I think it is going to rain.<br> - No. it will not rain.<br> - When you say so, it always does.<br> - I shall keep to the garden.<br> We are very proud of your Thomas.<br> His papa has such a way with him.<br> Oh, there you are.<br> Come and meet little Thomas.<br> I cannot see Marianne.<br> Love is not love which alters<br> when it alteration finds. -<br> - or bends with the remover<br> to remove.<br> Oh. no. It is an ever fixed mark -<br> - that looks on tempests<br> and is never shaken.<br> Willoughby ...<br> Willoughby ...<br> Willoughby ...<br> Marianne!<br> - She'll be wet through.<br> - Thank you for pointing that out.<br> Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.<br> Brandon will find her.<br> We can all guess where she went.<br> She's not hurt.<br> but we must get her warm.<br> There is a fire lit in my room.<br> Do hurry!<br> I think Marianne may need<br> a doctor.<br> You'll wear yourself out. A day or<br> two in bed will set her to rights.<br> You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.<br> I've never found a better physician.<br> - What is the diagnosis?<br> - It is an infectious fever.<br> - I recommend removing your child.<br> - Mrs. Bunting!<br> Miss Dashwood ...<br> I am more sorry than I can say.<br> - If you prefer me to stay I shall.<br> - That is very kind.<br> But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris<br> will look after us.<br> Thank you for all you have done.<br> She's not doing as well<br> as I would like.<br> What can I do?<br> - You've done so much already.<br> - Anything, or I shall run mad.<br> She would be easier<br> if her mother were here.<br> I must fetch more laudanum.<br> I cannot pretend that your sister's<br> condition is not very serious.<br> You must prepare yourself.<br> I will return shortly.<br> Marianne ...<br> Marianne, please try ...<br> Marianne ...<br> Please try ...<br> I cannot ...<br> I cannot do without you.<br> I've tried to bear everything else.<br> I will try ...<br> But please, dearest ...<br> ... beloved Marianne ...<br> ... do not leave me alone.<br> Elinor ...<br> My mother ...<br> She is out of danger.<br> She is out of danger.<br> - Where is Elinor?<br> - I'm here.<br> Dearest. I am here.<br> Col. Brandon ...<br> Thank you.<br> He's not so dashing as Willoughby,<br> but he has a pleasing countenance.<br> There was something in Willoughby's<br> eyes at times that I did not like.<br> "Nor is the earth the lesse.<br> or loseth aught."<br> "What from one place doth fall is<br> with the tide to another brought."<br> "For there is nothing lost<br> but may be found ...<br> ... if sought."<br> - Shall we continue tomorrow?<br> - No, for I must away.<br> - Away! Where?<br> - That I cannot tell you.<br> It is a secret.<br> You will not stay away long<br> There.<br> There I fell.<br> and there I first saw Willoughby.<br> Poor Willoughby.<br> He will always regret you.<br> Does it follow that. had he chosen<br> me he would have been content<br> He would have had a wife he loved.<br> but no money, -<br> - and might have learned to rank<br> his Pocketbook above his heart.<br> If his regrets are half as painful<br> as mine, he will suffer enough.<br> Do you compare<br> your conduct with his?<br> I compare it to what it<br> ought to have been. With yours.<br> I fetched those beef fillets. Ma'am.<br> Beef is less expensive in Exeter.<br> Anyway, it's for Marianne.<br> - Was Exeter crowded?<br> - It was. Ma'am.<br> Miss Pothington<br> has had another stroke.<br> And Miss Murden has turned away<br> Coles for his drunkenness.<br> And Mr. Ferrars is married.<br> but of course you know that.<br> Who told you he was married?<br> I saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and<br> Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.<br> I saw it was Miss Steele.<br> so I took off my hat.<br> She inquired after all of you,<br> especially Miss Dashwood.<br> She bade me give their compliments.<br> They're sending a piece of the cake.<br> - Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?<br> - She said she was vastly contented.<br> As she was always an affable lady,<br> I made free to wish her joy.<br> Thank you, Thomas.<br> - What is it. Thomas!<br> - I'm not sure, but it's heavy.<br> "It is small enough for the parlour.<br> When I follow shortly, I expect -<br> - that you've learnt the enclosed.<br> Your friend, Christopher Brandon."<br> It fits perfectly.<br> Here you are, Miss Marianne.<br> Fetch some tea.<br> - He must like you very much.<br> - It's for all of us.<br> Here is Col. Brandon.<br> - I do not think it is the colonel.<br> - He said he would arrive today.<br> Edward!<br> It is Edward!<br> Calm.<br> We must be calm.<br> Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.<br> Edward ...<br> What a pleasure to see you.<br> - I trust I find you all well<br> - Thank you. We are all very well.<br> We've been enjoying fine weather ...<br> Well. we have .<br> I'm glad to hear it.<br> The roads were very dry.<br> I wish you great joy, Edward.<br> I hope<br> you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.<br> Tolerably ... Thank you.<br> Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new Parish?<br> No ... my mother is in town.<br> I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.<br> You've not heard?<br> I think you mean my brother.<br> Mrs. Robert Ferrars.<br> - Mrs. Robert Ferrars?<br> - Yes.<br> I received a letter<br> from Miss Steele. -<br> - or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,<br> communicating to me -<br> - the transfer of her affections<br> to my brother Robert.<br> It seems they were much<br> thrown together in London.<br> In view of my new circumstances<br> I felt it only right -<br> - that she be released<br> from our engagement.<br> At any rate, they were married<br> last week in Plymouth.<br> Then you ...<br> ... are not married?<br> No.<br> Elinor ...<br> I met Lucy when I was very young.<br> Had I had a profession, I would not<br> have felt such an idle inclination.<br> At Norland, I convinced myself that<br> you felt only friendship for me, -<br> - and that it was my heart alone<br> that I was risking.<br> I have come with no expectations,<br> only to express, now I am able, -<br> - that my heart is,<br> and always will be ...<br> ... yours.<br> - He's sitting next to her.<br> - What else?<br> Tell us!<br> He's kneeling down!<br>
