No, no, Major.<br> It wasjust that, when you were...<br> away forthese last 2 days.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Yes, well, I telephoned the hotel.<br> I talked to Miss Cooper.<br> I told her I was visiting a friend.<br> A company commander of mine...<br> served under me in the desert campaigns.<br> Ran into a bit of luck.<br> I thought I'd give him a hand.<br> You're always trying to help people,<br> aren't you, Major?<br> Well, yes, but, ah...<br> well, the fellow saved my life once,<br> just outside of El Alamein.<br> Pinned down. Short of petrol.<br> He was a good man.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Mark you, Jerry in the desert was<br> a very different cup of tea<br> from Jerry on the western front.<br> - W-were you in Normandy, too, Major?<br> - No, no, desert rats, you know.<br> - Still, we got to Berlin, eventually.<br> - Berlin must have been depressing.<br> Berlin depressing?<br> What with all those frauleins and<br> all those... all those madchens?<br> I should say not.<br> By Jove, I could tell youa thing ortwo.<br> Good life, yes, indeed.<br> Well, let's go and get<br> brushed up for dinner, what?<br> There you are, dear.<br> Having a stroll with the major?<br> - Yes, mummy.<br> - 'Evening, Mrs. Railton-Bell.<br> Good evening, Major.<br> - Had your watch stopped, darling?<br> - N-no, mummy, it's go...<br> Oh, well, t-the major was telling me<br> all about the desert campaign.<br> Yes, I'm sorry to have kept your pride<br> and joy out in the cold, Mrs. R-B.<br> The fact is,<br> I got on to the old days.<br> That's the trouble with us<br> old retired warhorses, what, what?<br> We all talk too much.<br> Yes.<br> Well, if you'll excuse me.<br> Ah, Sibyl, my dearest...<br> do you mind if yourtactless old mother<br> whispers something in your ear?<br> No, mummy.<br> My dear, such a wonderful<br> concert this afternoon...<br> Oh, yes, Gladys, yes.<br> I'lljoin you in the game room.<br> Oh, all right, dear.<br> It'sjust that, do you think it wise<br> to make yourfeeling forthe major quite so public?<br> - My feelings forthe major?<br> - Yes, staring at him all the time.<br> Talking to him for hours on end.<br> Those meetings down on the front.<br> Quite a lot of people<br> are beginning to notice.<br> You don't mean...<br> You can't mean...<br> Oh, no. How can<br> people be so awful?<br> Control yourself.<br> - Don't get into one of your states now.<br> - It's all right, mummy.

Well, I wasjust going to say,<br> when I was at Sandhurst,<br> and when I was at Wellington, too.<br> I was a hit like you, you know...<br> sweating away at the books all the time.<br> Cramming away like mad, I was.<br> Military history, great battles of the past.<br> Clausewitz and all that sort of stuff.<br> I could have told you<br> a lot about Clausewitz at the point.<br> Oh, really, sir?<br> And you can't now, huh?<br> No, not anymore, I'm afraid.<br> Everything goes, you know. Everything goes.<br> Still, I don't regret it.<br> I did jolly well at Sandhurst.<br> Oh, did you get the sword of honor, sir?<br> Get the what?<br> - The sword of honor?<br> - Oh, the sword of honor.<br> No, I came close to it, though.<br> Passed out pretty high, pretty high.<br> Yes, you're quite right, sir.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, my boy. Please go on.<br> 'Fraid I talk too much.<br> Not at all, sir, but Miss Cooper<br> just walked by and you were looking for her.<br> Oh, did she? Yes, I-I want to have<br> a little chat with her. Thank you.<br> - Keep up the good work, now.<br> - Well, I'll try, sir.<br> Good man.<br> Ah, there we are, Miss Cooper.<br> - What can I do foryou, Major?<br> - It's nothing important, really.<br> It'sjust that they're sending me up<br> a copy of the West Hampshire Weekly News.<br> I wondered if it had arrived yet.<br> The West Hampshire News?<br> Yes, I'm told they have a pretty<br> good page of small ads.<br> I thought I might pick up<br> a portable typewriter.<br> I'm taking a stab at the old war<br> memoirs, you know.<br> Of course, if there are any bargains,<br> one has to be quick off the mark.<br> Yes, well, there are<br> some things in my office.<br> I haven't been through them yet.<br> - I'll have a look.<br> - Oh, that's very good of you. Thank you.<br> I can't understand it.<br> There's still no answer.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Fowler.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> - One of your old flames, Eh, Mr. Fowler?<br> - Old flames?

I do want to marry you.<br> - You know, I can never understand why...<br> - You know my views in marriage perfectly well.<br> I intend to produce paintings, not children.<br> And be kept in luxury by<br> London's most celebrated surgeon.<br> - Wh-who has failed to pass his anatomy.<br> - Charles?<br> Let's go for a walk in the garden.<br> Hmm? Oh, darling, first it's billiards,<br> now it's a walk.<br> But it looks so romantic.<br> Now, how can I possibly mix<br> anatomy with romance?<br> Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.<br> Well, I'm obviously not going<br> to get any work done.<br> Come on.<br> The dinner gong'll go in 15 minutes.<br> Well, where on earth<br> are we going to walk in 15 minutes?<br> Oh, Charles, how dim can you be?<br> Well, I ratherthink<br> we better play billiards.<br> Go in, you blighter.<br> Bad luck, Mr. Fowler.<br> Oh, well, I only play for exercise.<br> That'll be a shilling, please, Mr. Fowler.<br> - You'll ruin me, Miss Meacham.<br> - Come on, Charles.

Mea Culpa.<br> Mea Culpa.<br> I'm so late, I think<br> I'll give it a miss this evening.<br> Everything all right?<br> Everything's fine,<br> Everything's on the top line.<br> The fact is, I got to thinking<br> about those memoirs,<br> and time rather ran away,<br> I'm afraid.<br> I, ah... I found 1 or 2, ah,<br> portable typewriters.<br> - Oh, good, good.<br> - Yes.<br> I don't suppose the, ah, West Hampshire<br> Weekly News is much read, is it?<br> What?<br> Mrs. Railton-Bell takes it every week.<br> Does she?<br> Whateverfor?<br> Well, there's not a lot goes<br> on in the world.<br> Even in West Hampshire,<br> that she cares to miss.<br> And she can afford four pence<br> forthe information.<br> Yes, I suppose so.<br> It's funny, though, I've never actually<br> seen her reading it, have you?<br> There's a lot of stuff she has sent it<br> she doesn't read.<br> Most of it she leaves<br> on this table.<br> You mean, her copy's been<br> here all the rime?<br> No, Major, that will be sent<br> up with the evening papers.<br> Oh, well, dash it all.<br> I've gone and wasted four pence.<br> For nothing, what, what?<br> I mean, I could have borrowed hers, eh?<br> Oh, sorry, Miss Cooper, mustn't<br> keep you gossiping.<br> Well, thanks again.<br> - Cheery-bye.<br> - Major.<br> I thought you said we were<br> going upstairs.<br> Darling, we'vejust finished dinner.<br> Well, I don't see<br> what that has to do with it.<br> Hmm? Well, this is more important, dear.<br> That's terrible thing to say.<br> There, now.<br> You better wipe the lipstick off.<br> The old girls might notice.<br> Even the old girls knowthe facts of life.<br> They may knowthem,<br> but they don't like them.<br> You know,<br> if you would only marry me,<br> we wouldn't have to worry<br> about the old girls.<br> In fact, we wouldn't have<br> to worry about anything.<br> We could lead a nice, normal,<br> peaceful existence, and...<br> Oh, damn, here they come.<br> Not so much the pork as the stuffing.<br> Excuse me.<br> Good evening.<br> Look at them.<br> There's your normal, peaceful existence.<br> Sh... darling.<br> Conventions and marriage...<br> I don't want to end up like them.<br> Will you shut up?<br> They'll hearyou.<br> I've figured it all out.<br> Life isn't meant to be dreary,<br> it's meant to be exciting.<br> Will you shut up?<br> Bed.<br> I'm on... I'm on the trickiest duct<br> in the whole human body.<br> Now, please...<br> Bed.<br> Come on.<br> Good... good night, ladies.<br> Good night. Sleep tight.<br> Surely, a somewhat<br> unnecessary remark, Gladys, dear.<br> Oh, They're... They're old friends.<br> Th-they'rejust here to study.<br> That's what they told Miss Cooper.<br> I think it most unwise of her<br> to have them here.<br> Even at opposite ends of the corridor.<br> Quite obvious they were making love.<br> How do you know?<br> He was putting a handkerchief away<br> with lipstick on it.<br> Oh, well, perhaps they are in love.<br> So why don't they say so?<br> I hate anything furtive.<br> Now, what were we talking about?<br> Oh, good gracious.<br> Oh, please shut that door,<br> there's a most terrible draft.<br> A draft?<br> Bless my soul, so therejolly well is.<br> - He's so amusing.<br> - He's drunk.<br> A brilliant observation,<br> Mrs... Railton-Bell. Brilliant.<br> - I'm sure she didn't mean...<br> - Oh, tut, tut, tut, lady Matheson.<br> It's nice to have a champion, thank you.<br> But she's right. Irish whiskey.<br> Hello, Sibyl,<br> how are you this evening?<br> Fine.<br> But if it hadn't been forthe Irish whiskey,<br> I'd have never broken my record.<br> I made it back here<br> from the bar at the Feathers<br> in 6 minutes flat, instead of the usual 10.<br> Of course, I had the wind at the back.<br> But as you and I know,<br> Mrs... Railton-Bell,<br> we cannot deny<br> the propulsive powers of Irish whiskey.<br> Now, scotch, on the other hand...<br> Mr. Malcolm, did you come in<br> through the French windows?<br> Miss Cooper, I cannot tell a lie.<br> You knowthat is strictly<br> forbidden after 7:00.<br> I'm sorry, I... I'd forgotten.<br> There's mud all overthe floor.<br> Will you please hang this<br> in the proper place.<br> Yes, Ma'am.<br> Also, wipe yourfeet in the mat<br> provided forthat purpose.<br> Yes, Ma'am.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I shall see this doesn't happen again.<br> I must say, quite frankly, Miss Cooper,<br> I've never understood<br> how you could tolerate such boorishness,<br> and have done all this time.<br> In a hotel, one must<br> tolerate all sorts of things.<br> I suppose so.<br> But one hardly expects to find<br> that kind of person in this kind of hotel.<br> Why he should have selected<br> the beauregard as a permanent residence<br> is quite beyond me.<br> He was stationed near here<br> during the war, I believe.<br> He used to stay here then.<br> Ah, he writes very nicely.<br> I read an article of this once,<br> Just out of curiosity. It was about labor.<br> Have you ever read...<br> I have no curiosity<br> about the working classes.<br> - How many have you had?<br> - 2, well, 3.<br> Definitely not more than 4.<br> I'm sorry, Pat.<br> I know I shouldn't.<br> You knowthat I love you, don't you?<br> Very sincerely.<br> That sounds like<br> what a brother says to a sister.<br> Sister? You know my feelings<br> foryou go beyond that.<br> Just howfar beyond, John?<br> Well, I had a dim recollection<br> we were engaged, or hadn't I?<br> I rather wondered if you had.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> Come on, now something's the matter.<br> After all, most women feel rather<br> odd about a proposal of marriage,<br> especially if they hear it once rather late<br> at night and the man's had a few drinks.<br> All right, well announce it<br> publicly, right now.<br> Oh, John.<br> - What?<br> - There's someone...<br> Yes?<br> Despite the hour and the drink,<br> you did mean it?<br> You go and have your dinner.<br> I told cook to keep you something hot.<br> Let's walk down to<br> the beach tonight.<br> Darling, I can't.<br> I... I've got to close up...<br> Let's walk down<br> to the beach tonight.<br> Well, you ask me again when you...<br> when you've had your coffee.<br> Miss Meacham.<br> Oh, you in at last?<br> Thank heavens.<br> The pork's off, Mr. Malcolm,<br> and the goulash is drying out,<br> but we kept you some soup.<br> What a pity young Ridgewell wasn't here.<br> He'd have enjoyed the turnover.<br> The Cook's acquiring a lightertouch<br> with her pastry, don't you think?<br> Notjudging by the tarts<br> we had at tea yesterday...<br> cannon balls, simply cannon balls.<br> Here we are.<br> Tuck into that while I get the goulash.<br> Not but what I wouldn't think<br> you'd had your liquid already.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Surprised?<br> I gave up being surprised<br> by you 5 years ago.<br> You gave up a lot of things 5 years ago.<br> - Is this youryearfor looking up old husbands?<br> - Only the special ones.<br> If you must know, I ran into some<br> friends of ours at a party in London.<br> - Friends of ours?<br> - All right, mine.<br> They said you were having<br> a pretty rough time getting along these days.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> I wanted to help you.<br> Well, that's really touching.<br> I'm overwhelmed.<br> Goulash.<br> - Aren't you going to eat your soup?<br> - I'll have 2 bowls tomorrow.<br> Tomato aspic tomorrow.<br> Oh, don't take long, will you?<br> My friend's waiting.<br> Now, is there anything else?<br> You find it impossible to believe.<br> I care about what's happened to you.<br> - Not impossible, Ann, just incredible.<br> - Call it selfish if you want,<br> but I'd feel much better if I could<br> make up in some way forthe past.<br> What is this, a bribe<br> to ease your conscience?<br> Now, look, John, I...<br> I'm not saying who was right<br> wrong over what happened.<br> I'm only concerned<br> seeing you like this.<br> You'll forget all about it<br> by the time you reach London tomorrow.<br> - Tomorrow?<br> - You are leaving in the morning?<br> - Well, yes. Yes, of course. It you like.<br> - Fine. That's settled then.<br> What do you possibly do here?<br> I enjoy one great luxury...<br> being left alone.<br> Well, it's a quaint spot<br> you've picked out foryourself.<br> Yes, your last husband<br> would've done wonders with this place.<br> Interior decorator, wasn't he?<br> When he worked.<br> How long were you married to him?<br> - 2 years and 6 months.<br> - Beats us by 3 months.<br> - Cruelty again, wasn't it?<br> - A legal device.<br> You mean he didn't break down<br> the bedroom doorto get at you, hmm?<br> No.<br> He didn't try to kill me, either.<br> I sawthe headlines of the divorce.<br> Educating, but not nearly<br> so sensational as ours, you'll admit.<br> Oh, you were you interested enough<br> to read about it.<br> Reading worthless items is<br> a bad habit I picked up in prison.<br> You see, there was nothing else to do.<br> My wife never came to see me.<br> I only did what I thought<br> was best foryou.<br> You know something, Ann?<br> No one I know of lies with such sincerity.<br> Ow, if you'll excuse me.<br> Do you know what I think?<br> I think you've found a new girl.<br> - The morning train leaves at 10:45.<br> - You must like her a lot.<br> I do.<br> I'm going to marry her.<br> John...<br> Don't misunderstand.<br> I think it's rally wonderful<br> you've found someone else.<br> I didn't mean any harm.<br> - That's when you do the most damage.<br> - We all make mistakes.<br> - You specialize in them.<br> - Only little ones, though.<br> I still have a scat on the side of my head<br> to remind me of one of yours.<br> Most, I suppose.<br> Not all, though.<br> Well, I...<br> I may not see you in the morning.<br> - Shall we say goodbye now?<br> - I think we've said it.<br> I'm awfully glad to see you again, John.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> Oh, John, that was an innocent kiss.<br> You have nothing I want.<br> I'm happily engaged to be married<br> and came to England to meet his family.<br> He's everything I want in a man.<br> He doesn't have to turn wild<br> beast to prove it.<br> Now you must feel as foolish as you look.<br> John.<br> If you didn't want to see the program, dear,<br> you should have said so.<br> Caught in the act, what, what?<br> I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. R. B.<br> The fact is, there was something<br> in the Evening Standard<br> that I particularly wanted to look at.<br> I'm afraid I appropriated your copy.<br> Would you mind very much<br> if I borrowed it for a minute or 2?<br> That isn't the Evening Standard<br> you're looking at, Major.<br> It's what?<br> No. It's the West Hampshire Weekly News.<br> Well, I'm blithered.<br> Absolutely blithered.<br> What an astonishing thing.<br> I must have pulled out<br> the wrong paper, I suppose.<br> Mea culpa. Mea culpa. My fault.<br> - I can't understand how I did that.<br> - Neither do I. There's quite a difference.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> The West Hampshire News<br> is hardly my cup of tea. What, what?<br> Well. Ah, is it all right then,<br> if I borrow your Standard for a little while?<br> If you return it.<br> Jolly decent of you, Mrs. R. B.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Well, afterthat, I think I'll go<br> and take a look at somejolly.<br> I understand there's a new quiz program on.<br> A small boy of 9just won over40 pounds.<br> Yes, I... I hear he's very clever.<br> Shall I be seeing you in there,<br> then, dear Miss R. B?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Oh, no, I... I forgot.<br> I have to write a letter.<br> Oh, oh, I see.<br> Well, cheery-bye, both.<br> I wish he wouldn't use that revolting expression.<br> It's so common.<br> But, of course, he's such<br> an awfully common little man.<br> Oh, no, mummy.<br> Do you think so?<br> He was in a very good regiment.<br> You can be in the horse guards dear,<br> and still be common.<br> I don't know what you see in him.<br> Oh, it... it'sjust that I like<br> all his stories about the war<br> and the desert and the regiment,<br> and he's seen so much of life<br> and I haven't.<br> I don't know what you mean by that,<br> dear, I'm sure.<br> Oh, well, I only meant...<br> I'm sorry, mummy.<br> Of course, I realize that you must occasionally<br> miss some of the little gaieties of life...<br> the balls and cocktail parties,<br> and things that a few other lucky young people can enjoy.<br> - I do my best, you know.<br> - Yes, I know you do, mummy...<br> There was Scotland last year, and our<br> Scandinavian cruise the year before.<br> Yes, I... I know mummy, I know, and please,<br> please, don't think that I'm not grateful.<br> - It... it's only...<br> - Only, what, dear?<br> If only I could do something.<br> And, mummy, there's an advertisement<br> in the newspaperfor a telephone operator.<br> My dear, we've been overthis so often.<br> You'd never stand it,<br> even for a few days.<br> You rememberJones and Jones?<br> Yes, but it was so stifling hot there<br> in the basement of Jones and Jones,<br> and this... thisjob<br> in the newspaper is different.<br> Now, you're not a very strong child.<br> You must try and get that into your head.<br> Your nervous system isn't nearly<br> as sound as it should be.<br> Y-you... you mean my 'states',<br> but... but I haven't had<br> one of those for a long time.<br> I know, dear. You've been very good,<br> very good indeed.<br> But there's quite a difference in<br> not having an hysterical fit,<br> and being able to keep ajob.<br> Now... Go and fetch me<br> that newspaper, will you, dear?<br> Yes, mummy.<br> - Uh, oh, which one do you want?<br> - The West Hampshire Weekly News.<br> I want to see what the major<br> was so interested in.<br> Oh, dear, what a silly-billy.<br> I've gone and left my glasses upstairs.<br> Oh, well, shall I go and get them foryou?<br> Will you, dear?<br> That would be so kind of you.<br> I hate you fetching and carrying for me,<br> but you know, my poor old legs are a bit tired.<br> - I think you'll find them on the table by my bed.<br> - Yes, mummy.<br> Oh, my dear, there's the most<br> wonderful quiz program in television.<br> - There's a little boy...<br> - Gladys, have you got your glasses?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - Oh, good.<br> I idiotically left mine upstairs.<br> Here, read this out to me.<br> - 'Cab driver loses license.'<br> - No, no, no, no. 'Ex-officer pleads guilty.'<br> 'Ex-officer pleads guilty.<br> Offense in theater.'<br> - Oh, my dear, do we really want to read this?<br> - Y-yes, we do, Go on.<br> - But what about the television?<br> - This is infinitely more important.<br> On Thursday last,<br> before the Bournemouth magistrate,<br> 'David Angus Pollock, 55,<br> giving his address as the Beauregard hotel, Morgan... '<br> Pollock...<br> - Maj. Pollock?<br> - Go on.<br> ...Morgan crescent, Bournemouth,<br> pleaded guilty to a charge of insulting behavior<br> 'on a Bournemouth cinema."<br> - Oh, he must've been drinking.<br> - No. He only drinks one glass of port a day.<br> Go on.<br> A Mrs. Osborne, 43 of 4<br> Studland Road, giving evidence,<br> stated that Pollock, sitting next to her,<br> persistently nudged her in the arm<br> and later attempted to take other liberties.<br> She subsequently vacated her seat<br> and complained to an usherette.<br> Insp. Brown, giving evidence, said that in response<br> to a telephone call from the theater manager,<br> Pollock had been kept<br> under observation by police officers,<br> from 3:50 P.M. Until 7:10 P.M.<br> By which time he had been observed<br> to change his seat no less than 5 times,<br> always choosing a seat next to<br> a female person.<br> There had, he admitted,<br> been no further complaints.<br> But that was not unusual in cases of this kind.<br> On leaving the theater,<br> Pollock was arrested.<br> Is that all?<br> Oh, yes. 'Mr. William Cowther,<br> appearing on behalf of the defendant,<br> stated that his client had<br> had a momentary aberration.<br> He was extremely sorry<br> and ashamed of himself<br> and would undertake neverto behave<br> in so stupid and improper a manner in future.<br> He asked that his client's war record<br> should be taken into account.<br> He had enlisted as a private<br> in the army in 1925,<br> and afterthe outbreak of war in 1939,<br> was granted a commission<br> as 2nd lieutenant in the army...<br> supply corps.<br> During the whole of the war<br> he had held a responsible position<br> in an army supply depot in the west Indies.'<br> - The whole of the war?<br> - Yes, dear. I heard you. Go on.<br> In 1946, he had been demobilized<br> with the rank of full lieutenant.<br> The defendant was not called.<br> The chairman of the bench,<br> giving judgment, said,<br> you have behaved disgustingly,<br> but because this appears to be your 1st offense,<br> we propose to deal leniently with you.<br> The defendant was put<br> in probation for 12 months.<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear.<br> He must have thought<br> he's got away with it.<br> - What a stroke of luck I take this paper.<br> - Luck? Humph. Was it luck?<br> I almost...<br> Oh, dear, poor Sibyl.<br> Maud, you mustn't tell her.<br> Not tell her?<br> I... I mean, not the details.<br> Not about the theater.<br> Oh, dear, I don't know how<br> I shall look him in the face again.<br> You won't have to, dear.<br> I'm going straight to miss Cooper<br> and insist that he leaves the hotel<br> before luncheon time tomorrow.<br> Oh, Maud, do you think you ought to?<br> Gladys, what's come overyou this evening?<br> Of course I ought to.<br> Well, you know what Miss Cooper is...<br> She's so independent and stubborn.<br> - Perhaps she won't agree.<br> - She'll have to if we all insist.<br> We don't all insist.<br> Well, I... I mean, there's only two of us.<br> Oughtn't we to consult the others?<br> Oh, dear, that means<br> we shall have to tell them.<br> An excellent idea, Gladys.<br> Let's go and get them all together.<br> I'm sorry it took so long, mummy.<br> Here are your glasses.<br> Oh, you found them, clever girl.<br> Well, I don't need them now.<br> Gladys, go and see who's in the game room.<br> Oh, Mrs. Shankland. We'd like you<br> to come to a meeting in the lounge.<br> - Oh, but I... I...<br> - Ah, I'll tell you all about it in a moment.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Am I reading your magazine?<br> - Oh, no, no. You go right ahead Mrs. Shankland.<br> I didn't expect to find a fashion magazine here.<br> Does Miss Coopertake it?<br> O-Oh, no. No, it's... it's, um...<br> It's yours, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> You must forgive me for staring at you,<br> but you look so beautiful,<br> I really couldn't help it.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Y-you lookjust like<br> the pictures in the magazine.<br> Oh, but my picture hasn't been<br> in a magazine, not foryears.<br> Oh, but I rememberthem, though, and...<br> and I've always wondered who you were<br> and the exciting kind of life<br> you must have led, and...<br> and you lookjust the same,<br> just as lovely.<br> Well, thank you.<br> That's very sweet of you.<br> - Sibyl?<br> - I recognized you the moment that you came into the...<br> - Sibyl?<br> - Yes, mummy. I'm here.<br> Forgive me for staring at you.<br> It was very rude.<br> Oh, Sibyl, dear, I think you'd better<br> go to your room, if you don't mind.<br> Oh, but why, mummy?<br> Because we're going to have<br> a little meeting in here<br> with some of the regular residents,<br> to discuss a matter of grave urgency,<br> which hasjust cropped up.<br> Oh, but how exciting. Well, can't I stay?<br> After all, I'm a regular, too.<br> Yes, yes, yes, I know, dear.<br> But I don't think the subject is<br> at all suitable foryou.<br> - If this is to be a meeting of the residents, I'm...<br> - No, no, please, Mrs. Shankland.<br> Although you're only temporary,<br> we would so like you to feel that you're one of us,<br> and as a woman of the world,<br> we would value your advice.<br> - But what is it, mummy?<br> - Oh, what an inquisitive child it is.<br> Well, I'll tell you this much...<br> But only this much.<br> It concerns yourfriend, the Major,<br> and it's extremely grave.<br> But I don't understand.<br> What is it, mummy?<br> I'm not going to tell you any more.<br> - It might upset you too much.<br> - But I must know, mummy. I must...<br> Please, don't raise your voice so, dear.<br> - You really insist I should tell you?<br> - Yes, mummy. I do.<br> - Even after my strong warning?<br> - Yes, mummy.<br> Very well then,<br> I've no option.<br> Read that.<br> Middle column,<br> top of the page.<br> I couldn't find...<br> - Oh, Maud, you haven't told her.<br> - I did my best, but she insisted.<br> She absolutely insisted.<br> My dear, I'm so sorry.<br> Must be a dreadful shock foryou.<br> It was for us, too.<br> Are you all right?<br> Sibyl, are you all right?<br> Yes, mummy.<br> Oh, S-Sibyl,<br> you've broken my glasses.<br> Ohh, and you've cut your hand.<br> Here, let me see it.<br> I think you'd better wrap<br> this around it forthe moment.<br> It's only a scratch, Mrs. Shankland,<br> that's much too fine a handkerchief.<br> Oh, that's all right.<br> I have another in my bag.<br> Well, now shall we...<br> shall we all sit down?<br> Mr. Fowler, would you<br> draw up that chair, please?<br> - Gladys, where are the others?<br> - I couldn't find anyone else.<br> - Edgar's gone to look for Mr. Malcolm.<br> - Oh, I shouldn't have bothered.<br> He always has so much to say.<br> Now, let us all be seated.<br> ...who, it turns out,<br> was only a lieutenant<br> in the service supply depot,<br> and was arrested in the cinema.<br> I can't believe it. Incredible.<br> The question now becomes,<br> 'What are we going to do about it? '<br> The Major will be watching television for a while<br> and we don't want to be interrupted.<br> I feel we should act firmly<br> and quickly to rid ourselves<br> of this dangerous person in our midst.<br> I must admit, I always suspected<br> the public school education.<br> And only this evening,<br> he made a most shocking mistake in quoting Horace.<br> - Oh, please...<br> - Quite appalling.<br> Please, Mr. Fowler,<br> we're getting away from the subject.<br> The ugly fact remains<br> that this fellow resident of ours<br> was arrested and found guilty.<br> - Pleaded guilty.<br> - Please, Gladys.<br> Found or pleaded guilty<br> to a disgusting offense.<br> Which fellow resident?<br> What disgusting offense?<br> I don't think this is a matter<br> that would interest you, Mr. Malcolm.<br> It seems to interest<br> our newest resident.<br> I don't see why<br> it shouldn't interest one of our oldest.<br> Very well. If you must know,<br> Maj. Pollock has behaved immorally<br> to no less than 6 respectable women in a local cinema.<br> Well, that's quite a performance.<br> Really, Maud, on behalf of the Major,<br> I must remind you,<br> that we only knowthat<br> one of them was respectable...<br> the one who made a complaint.<br> And even she behaved very oddly.<br> I mean, why didn't she say<br> right out to the Major,<br> 'Will you please stop doing<br> wh-whatever it is you are doing? '<br> That's what I would have done.<br> A-and we don't know<br> anything about the others.<br> We don't even knowthat<br> he nudged them o-or anything.<br> Of course he nudged them.<br> He was in that cinema<br> for an immoral purpose.<br> He admitted it.<br> And he was seen to change his seat<br> no less than 5 times,<br> always choosing one<br> next to a female person.<br> Well, now, let's see.<br> That would make 10 nudges, wouldn't it,<br> if he used both elbows?<br> No, no, 11 with the original one.<br> Or 12, supposing...<br> I considerthis flippancy,<br> on a matter so serious, as utterly monstrous.<br> You're right, it is serious...<br> forthe poor Major.<br> What are you proposing to do?<br> Have him thrown out of the hotel?<br> I'm proposing it ask the option<br> of the other residents.<br> I plainly have no need to ask yours.<br> I don't know why you say that,<br> Mrs... Railton-Bell.<br> I feel repelled by what the Major's done.<br> I've always had an intense dislike for...<br> well, shall we say,<br> the more furtive forms of sexual expression.<br> I think it's only fair<br> to ask ourselves this question...<br> what harm has the man done?<br> Well, apart from bruising the elbow<br> of a certain lady whose...<br> whose motives in complaining...<br> I agree with lady Matheson are extremely questionable<br> Apart from that, and apart from telling us<br> a few rather pathetic lies about his past life,<br> which most of us do from time to time anyway.<br> I can't see that the Major's done anything<br> tojustify ourthrowing him out into the street.<br> Then it's quite obvious<br> you're against any action at all.<br> Well, I might give him<br> a cool glace at dinner.<br> - I think your attitude is shocking.<br> - Do you? Why?<br> After all, what has he done that's any worse<br> than people who cheapen love-making,<br> who use it as a weapon<br> to get what they want?<br> No, Mrs. Railton-Bell, I'm sure<br> there are people... people in this very room...<br> who have done theirfellow man<br> far more than the Major.<br> I don't agree.<br> I... I'm sorry.<br> Just forget I said anything.<br> No, that's quite all right,<br> Mrs... Shankland?<br> I'm sure that anything that you have<br> to say will be right to the point.<br> It wouldn't be fair.<br> I don't even knowthe Major.<br> We are talking about the Major?<br> We are indeed.<br> And nowthat we've heard your views<br> on the subject, Mr. Malcolm...<br> Odd, distasteful and dangerous<br> though they may be...<br> I think it's time we heard<br> from the others. Mr. Fowler.<br> Well, it's difficult.<br> Very difficult.<br> - I don't see what's difficult about it.<br> - Oh, but it is, you know.<br> I can't say that I see it like Malcolm.<br> Certain cats are wrong because they are,<br> in themselves and by themselves,<br> impure and immoral.<br> And it seems to me that this terrible<br> wave of vice and sexual excess<br> which has been flooding<br> the world since the war,<br> might well in part be due<br> to the decline of the old standards.<br> Tolerance is not necessarily a good.<br> Tolerance of evil can itself be an evil.<br> - After all, wasn't it Aristotle who said...<br> - Oh, really.<br> You've all gone on fartoo long about it.<br> And when you start quoting Aristotle,<br> personally I'm going to me room.<br> You heard, Miss Meacham?<br> I couldn't help hearing.<br> I didn't want to.<br> I was doing me betting system.<br> And you need to concentrate like billy-on on that.<br> I had my chair against the wall<br> to catch the light,<br> and I certainly wasn't going to<br> get eyestrainjust foryou people.<br> Well, as you knowthe facts,<br> perhaps we'd better canvass your opinion.<br> I haven't any. Why should I?<br> I've been out of the world<br> far longerthat any of you,<br> and what do I know of morals and ethics?<br> Only what I read in novels.<br> And as I only read thrillers,<br> that doesn't amount to much.<br> In Mickey Spillane, the hero does far worse<br> things to his girls than the Major's done,<br> and no one seems to mind.<br> It's hardly to the point what Mr. Spillane's<br> heroes do to his girls, Miss Meacham.<br> - We want your views on Maj. Pollock.<br> - Do you?<br> Well, my views on Maj. Pollock have<br> always been that he's a crashing old bore,<br> and a wicked old fraud.<br> Now I hear he's a dirty old man, too.<br> I'm not at all surprised.<br> And quite between these 4 walls,<br> I don't give a damn.<br> Sad, very, very sad.<br> Well, Mr. Fowler, I take it<br> you are in the side of action?<br> I once had to recommend a boy for expulsion...<br> only once, in all the 15 years<br> I was a house-master.<br> Are you in favor of action, Mr. Fowler?<br> Yes, I suppose so.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Gladys?<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear...<br> Oh, there you go,<br> shilly-shallying again, Gladys.<br> For heaven's sake,<br> make up your mind.<br> Are you on the side of Mr. Malcolm<br> with his defense of vice,<br> or on the side of the Christian virtues<br> like Mr. Fowler and myself.<br> Never in my life have I heard<br> a question so disgracefully begged.<br> - You should be in politics, Mrs. Railton-Bell.<br> - Gladys?<br> Of course I am on your side, dear.<br> - It's only that...<br> - Well, Mr. Malcolm,<br> apart from Miss Meacham and Mrs. Shankland,<br> who may be counted as neutral,<br> the count is 4 to 1 against you.<br> Now, shall we all go and<br> see Miss Cooper in a body,<br> or would you ratherthat<br> I acted as your spokesman?<br> - Oh, I... I think perhaps, dear, if you went...<br> - Yes. Perhaps that would be best.<br> Well, it's...<br> It's a duty I hardly relish.<br> Just a moment, Mrs. Railton-Bell.<br> We haven't heard from your daughter.<br> My daughter agree with me.<br> I know herfeelings on the subject.<br> I think she should be permitted<br> to speak for herself.<br> Sibyl, can we have your views?<br> Mr. Malcolm is speaking to you, dear.<br> - Yes, mummy.<br> - Can we have your views?<br> - My views?<br> - On Maj. Pollock, dear.<br> What action should we take about him?<br> It's the shock.<br> You know what you've<br> just read in the paper, dear.<br> What do you feel about it?<br> - It made me sick.<br> - Of course it did.<br> - That's how we all feel.<br> - It made me sick.<br> - It made me sick!<br> - Oh, Sibyl, stop that.<br> Stop that crying! Now, darling...<br> It made me sick...<br> Mummy, I don't feel well.<br> No, of course you don't feel well.<br> - It made me sick.<br> - Come, we'll go up to our room and lie down.<br> - Is she often like that?<br> - Oh, no, not often.<br> But sometimes, I'm afraid.<br> Her mother ought neverto have told her.<br> And I'm surprised at you, Mr. Malcolm.<br> You ought not to have brought her into it.<br> I suppose not.<br> I thought I might get her once,<br> just this once,<br> in the whole of her life,<br> to publicly disagree with her mother.<br> It could save her soul<br> if she ever did.<br> Oh, dear. Poor child.<br> Oh, the whole affair is too dreadful.<br> It's made me quite miserable.<br> Yes. The trouble about<br> being on the side of right,<br> as one sees it, is that one often finds oneself<br> in the company of such very questionable allies.<br> Oh, dear.<br> There's nothing to be done about it now.<br> Youryoung friend Mr. Ridgewell...<br> he nevertelephoned?<br> Well, he could still turn up.<br> I can here the front doorbell, you know.<br> And, of course, with all this,<br> I won't get a wink of sleep.<br> I wish he'd taken the trouble to call.<br> You're making it a bit too obvious, you know...<br> That you hate the very sight of me.<br> The very sight of you, Ann,<br> is perhaps the one thing about you I don't hate.<br> Please, John, don't be so ill-mannered.<br> All this fencing is a bit idiotic, isn't it?<br> I am leaving in the morning.<br> And I certainly wouldn't be here<br> if I'd known you were going to be married.<br> - Credit me at least with some degree of tact.<br> - I do. You were always very tactful,<br> especially about my bad manners.<br> I never mentioned your manners.<br> Incidentally, if you disliked me s intensely,<br> why did you ever marry me in the first place?<br> Do you want it reaffirmed after all these years?<br> Does your vanity need it that much?<br> I wanted you desperately.<br> My craving foryou was so violent,<br> I could deny you nothing.<br> Not even a marriage<br> that was bound to end in disaster.<br> Why disaster?<br> Ann, it's a long way from a Pennsylvania<br> steel town to upper park avenue.<br> Class distinction?<br> You always claimed it never existed.<br> Until I married you.<br> And then I really found out how wrong I was.<br> You see, Ann, my ideas<br> of a wife were influenced<br> by watching my mother ruin her health<br> to bring up 8 kids.<br> Not that my demands on you<br> would have been as high as that,<br> but they would've included the proper<br> running of a home and the bearing of children.<br> About children...<br> I did make it perfectly clear...<br> I know, I know.<br> The beautiful fashion model...<br> that little hobby of yours.<br> Yourfigure was too important<br> to risk for posterity.<br> I accepted the bargain.<br> I have no complaints.<br> But you have.<br> You know you have, John.<br> The same complaint as always...<br> that I didn't love you when we got married.<br> Oh, please.<br> Let's not go into that.<br> Why would I have married you,<br> if I didn't love you?<br> After all, there were others...<br> more important men.<br> They couldn't pay you the full price.<br> - What price?<br> - Enslavement.<br> Oh, John, really.<br> How ridiculous you are.<br> If all I wanted to do was<br> make my husband a slave,<br> why would I have chosen you<br> and not the others?<br> Because where would the fun have been...<br> where would the fun have been,<br> enslaving men like that?<br> Atame millionaire a mincing baronet.<br> Too well brought up to say anything<br> when you denied them their conjugal rights.<br> Too well-mannered not to take<br> your headaches at bedtime<br> asjust headaches at bedtime.<br> Where would the fun have been<br> turning your weapons on men like that?<br> No, Ann, you were reaching<br> onto another class.<br> You were looking for wilder game.<br> Rememberthat expression you used<br> when you introduced me to yourfriends?<br> 'My wild, roaring savage? '<br> That was always good for a laugh.<br> To turn your weapons on him, to...<br> to make him sit up and beg at the whispered<br> promise of what was his by right anyway.<br> To goad him to such a<br> fury of drink and rage<br> that he'd kick open the locked door<br> of your bedroom and damn near kill you.<br> That really must have been fun.<br> Forgive me, Ann, I...<br> I don't get many chances<br> at speechmaking these days.<br> Besides, I'm a little drunker<br> than usual tonight.<br> Because of seeing me?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> No, you're not.<br> - You haven't changed much.<br> - Haven't I?<br> The same old John,<br> pouring out the same old cascade of truths,<br> half-truths and distortions.<br> Well, human nature isn't<br> as simple as you make it, John.<br> You've left out the<br> most important fact of all...<br> You see, you're the only person in the world<br> I've ever really been fond of.<br> Notice howtactfully<br> I leave out the word 'Love.'<br> Give me a cigarette.<br> Oh, no...<br> Not those awful cheap things.<br> Hand me my bag.<br> Do you dispute that?<br> Yourfondness for me<br> was sometimes shown in surprising ways.<br> - Why are you staring at me?<br> - You know perfectly well why.<br> Well, don't.<br> It makes me embarrassed.<br> You really think I haven't<br> changed much?<br> - Uh, to look at, I mean?<br> - Not at all.<br> - Just the clever makeup, I expect.<br> - I don't think so.<br> I still think you're the most beautiful,<br> the most desirable woman I've ever known.<br> John, I really think you mean that.<br> You know, some of the thinks you used<br> to tell me might happen to me are happening.<br> Such as?<br> - Loneliness, for one.<br> - No friends?<br> Not many.<br> I haven't the gift.<br> What about yourfiance?<br> You really think<br> I'm in love with him?<br> It's always been you, John.<br> All these years.<br> It's so wonderful<br> seeing you again like this.<br> I'm only sorry it's too late.<br> If only I could just...<br> just stay on a little while.<br> I won't be a nuisance.<br> I won't, John, really, I won't.<br> Darling, please.<br> This is a public place.<br> Anyone might come out at any moment.<br> There's no one here for it<br> to make any difference to me, I...<br> I wasjust thinking of you.<br> Miss Cooper has given me<br> what appears to be a very isolated room,<br> the number of which is... 12.<br> Shall we go?<br> How do I look?<br> All right?<br> All right.<br> Mrs. Shankland,<br> you're wanted on the telephone.<br> It's a call from London.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> - You know where the telephone is?<br> - Yes, I do. Thank you very much.<br> You knew who<br> she was, didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> I must say, she's exactly<br> as you described herto me.<br> - 'Carved in ice,' you once said.<br> - Did I?<br> So that's the woman<br> who smashed up your lift.<br> She didn't, Pat.<br> I smashed up my own lift.<br> - If I hadn't been the sort of man I am...<br> - I knowthe sort of man you are, John.<br> And the sort of woman she is.<br> - In all the years I've known you...<br> - You don't know me at all.<br> I'm sorry, Pat, but...<br> blaming her isn't going to help.<br> I see.<br> I always knew in my heart<br> you were still in love with her.<br> - Pat, Pat, I...<br> - No, don't John, don't say anything.<br> I've known it all along.<br> Will you be going away with her?<br> I don't know.<br> - I don't know anything about the future.<br> - Yes, I expect you will.<br> She looks as if she's got<br> some willpower, that girl.<br> If she's taken that much trouble<br> to run you to earth down here,<br> She's not going to let you go so easily.<br> She didn't run me to earth, Pat.<br> She came down here to help me.<br> You rally believe that?<br> She was going to be married.<br> Herfiance is in London.<br> - And she came here to help you?<br> - Yes.<br> It doesn't strike you as strange...<br> All right, let's leave it at that.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Tell me.<br> - No.<br> What is it?<br> Tell me.<br> Don't knock me about, John.<br> I'm not her, you know.<br> Now I'll ask you a question...<br> does she know about us?<br> - No.<br> - You're sure of that?<br> I told her I was engaged,<br> but I didn't say to whom.<br> The only person who would know<br> about us is your publisher, David Wilder.<br> That's right.<br> She's talking to Mr. Wilder<br> on the telephone now.<br> - No, John, listen...<br> - It's all right, I-I want to talk to her.<br> - Please, please...<br> - I've got to talk to her.<br> - John...<br> - Ah, Miss Cooper?<br> - I'm sorry, I...<br> - I've been waiting foryou.<br> It's a matter of vital importance.<br> I can't go into it here.<br> - I merely ask you to read this.<br> - Very well.<br> And I may add, that I've taken<br> a consensus of the residents.<br> And we are unanimous...<br> virtually unanimous...<br> that the gentleman in question be asked<br> to leave before lunchtime tomorrow.<br> Come in.<br> I'lljust be a minute, darling.<br> Goodness, you didn't<br> give me much time.<br> I can wait.<br> Oh, there's some brandy on the bureau,<br> if you'd like.<br> But I really don't think you should,<br> do you?<br> John?<br> No.<br> That's a good boy.<br> Darling John.<br> Listen.<br> You can hearthe waves rolling in.<br> Just like that<br> hotel in East Hampton.<br> Like that first summer we met.<br> A little big perhaps,<br> a little grand.<br> But... we could make believe,<br> couldn't we?<br> We could wipe out everything<br> that's happened to us since.<br> The waves rolling in all night long.<br> Remember?<br> That completes it,<br> doesn't it?<br> What?<br> The stage is all set,<br> just like it was that night.<br> But I don't understand.<br> Are you afraid of the light?<br> - Why should I be afraid of the light?<br> - People who hate the light usually hate the truth.<br> The truth?<br> John, forgive me, but I don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> I'm talking about liars, Ann...<br> Liars and expensive tramps.<br> What are you trying to get at?<br> What did you say to Wilder?<br> How did you put it?<br> That you saved dear old John from<br> the hands of a grubby little hotel keeper?<br> and he was at yourfeet.<br> Why, his hands were shaking so much<br> he couldn't even light your cigarette.<br> Oh, John, please don't be angry with me.<br> I... I had to see you.<br> I was desperate to see you.<br> What for? Why?<br> To help me?<br> You wouldn't think of telling me the truth.<br> No. You had to have your conquest,<br> your unconditional surrender.<br> - And if you could do it by lying and cheating...<br> - All right.<br> I knew you were going to get married, but I...<br> and I should have said so from the beginning, but, I...<br> - I still have some pride left.<br> - Pride!<br> Yes!<br> I can see the makeup now, all right.<br> Little lines that weren't there before.<br> The beginning.<br> Soon there'll be more and more<br> and one day this face will begin to decay<br> and there'll be nothing left to make<br> a man grovel, to make him want to...<br> Why don't you?<br> John!<br> Don't leave me now, John!<br> John, come back!<br> Come back to my room.<br> John, don't go.<br> I can make you<br> forget all those silly lies.<br> John, come back!<br> What's happened?<br> I thought I heard...<br> Miss Cooper.<br> Miss Cooper,<br> Mrs. Shankland has had a fall.<br> I'm afraid she's hurt.<br> - I'll come at once.<br> - What is the matter? What's going on?<br> Mrs. Shankland has had a fall.<br> Oh? Miss Cooper,<br> I'd like my newspaper back.<br> - Yes. It's on my desk.<br> - You've read it, I trust?<br> - Yes, I have, Mrs. Railton-Bell.<br> - Poor dear. It's so dark on these stairs.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Think nothing of it.<br> Careful, now. Come along,<br> Mrs. Shankland.<br> - There now you're all right.<br> - That's all right, now.<br> - How's the weather, Miss Meacham?<br> - Dry as a bone outside.<br> I should have a winner<br> if it stays dry at Newbury.<br> - Did my handicap book arrive?<br> - Yes, I think...<br> That looks like it.<br> Miss Cooper, Mr. Malcolm wasn't in his room<br> when I took his tea up,<br> and his bed hadn't been slept in.<br> Yes, I know, Doreen.<br> - You know?<br> - I should've told you. I forgot.<br> Mr. Malcolm had to go to London<br> unexpectedly last night.<br> - Oh, he won't be in to breakfast then?<br> - No, I don't suppose he will.<br> That's something, anyway.<br> And what about the new lady?<br> She's not down yet.<br> She's down, Doreen.<br> I think she'll be in for breakfast.<br> Okay done.<br> She's leaving, isn't she?<br> The new one?<br> How did you know?<br> I heard her ask for her bags<br> to be brought down.<br> I knew she'd never stick it.<br> - 'Stick it', Miss Meacham?<br> - Oh, I don't mean the hotel.<br> Best forthe price in Bournemouth.<br> I've always said so.<br> I meant the life.<br> She's not an 'alone' type.<br> - Is anyone an 'alone' type, really?<br> - Oh, yes. They're rare, of course.<br> But you are, for one, I'd say.<br> You're self-sufficient.<br> I've very glad you think so. Miss Meacham,<br> perhaps even gladderthan you realize.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> I haven't the faintest idea.<br> I'm a bit tired this morning.<br> I... I had very little sleep last night.<br> Well, I don't suppose<br> you are glad, really.<br> Probably you haven't had to<br> face up to it yet.<br> I faced up to it very early on.<br> Long before I was an old wreck.<br> People have always scared me a bit, you see.<br> They're so complicated.<br> I suppose that's why I prefer horses.<br> Feeling better?<br> A bit.<br> Any word?<br> No. But I shouldn't worry.<br> He's... been out like this before.<br> I'd feel much better<br> if he'd come back.<br> I must catch that train.<br> Thank you for everything.<br> Hello, Miss R-B.<br> Enjoying the sunshine, what, huh?<br> By Jove, what a morning.<br> I've been walking on the Chins.<br> I must say, looking across that sea,<br> that sky, it could have been Tunis. It really could.<br> I remember out there one morning.<br> I the spring of '43...<br> Please, don't pretend anymore.<br> - Pretend? My dear Miss R-B...<br> - The West Hampshire Weekly News.<br> Mummy's read it, you see.<br> Did she show it to you?<br> Yes.<br> And to all the others.<br> Miss Cooper as well?<br> Yes.<br> She's asked Miss Cooper<br> to tell you to go.<br> I see.<br> Well, that's it then, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Oh, god!<br> Why did you do it?<br> Why did you do it?<br> I don't know.<br> I wish I could answerthat.<br> Why does anybody do anything<br> that they shouldn't?<br> Why do some people drink too much<br> and other people smoke 50 cigarettes a day?<br> Because they can't stop it,<br> I suppose.<br> Then this wasn't the fist time?<br> No.<br> Oh, it's horrible.<br> Yes, it is, of course.<br> I'm not trying to defend it.<br> You've never guessed this,<br> I know, but...<br> ever since school I've always<br> been scared to death of women.<br> Of everyone, in a way, I suppose,<br> but... but mostly of women.<br> I had a bad time at school.<br> Which wasn't Wellington, of course.<br> It wasjust a council school.<br> Boys hate other boys to be timid and shy,<br> and they gave it to me good and proper.<br> My father despised me, too.<br> He was a sergeant major in the shots guards.<br> He made mejoin the army,<br> but I was always a...<br> A bitter disappointment to him.<br> He died before I got my commission.<br> I got that by a wangle, too.<br> It wasn't very difficult<br> at the beginning of the war,<br> but it meant everything to me,<br> just the same...<br> being saluted,<br> being called 'sir.'<br> I thought, "I'm someone now,<br> a real person."<br> Perhaps...<br> some woman might even...<br> But it didn't work.<br> It never has worked.<br> I'm made in a certain way,<br> and I can't change it.<br> It has to be in the dark, you see,<br> and strangers, because...<br> Oh, stop it! Stop! Stop!<br> I don't want to hear any more.<br> I don't want to hear any more.<br> It'sjust that you asked me<br> why I did such things and I...<br> wanted to talk to somebody about it.<br> I never have, you see,<br> not in my whole life.<br> - I'm sorry if I upset you, of all people.<br> - Why me, especially? Why not the others?<br> Oh, I don't give a hang about the others.<br> They'll all take in their various ways, I suppose.<br> But it won't mean much more to them<br> thanjust another bit of gossip<br> to snort and snigger over.<br> But it'll be different foryou, Sibyl,<br> and that makes me very unhappy.<br> - That's the fist time you've called me Sibyl.<br> - Is it? Is it really?<br> Well, there's not much point<br> in all that Miss R-B" stuff now, is there?<br> What makes me<br> so different from the others?<br> I suppose it's because<br> you're so scared of...<br> well, shall we call it... 'life? '<br> That sounds more respectable than<br> that word I know you hate.<br> We're awfully alike, you know,<br> you and I, in many ways.<br> I suppose that's why we've drifted<br> so much together in this place.<br> How can you say<br> that we're alike?<br> Well, it'sjust that we're both<br> so frightened of other people,<br> and we somehow managed to forget out fright<br> when we've been in each other's company.<br> Speaking for myself,<br> I'm grateful. I... I always will be.<br> I can't expect you to feel<br> the same way now, of course.<br> Well, I'd better start packing, I suppose.<br> I should be able to<br> catch the 10:45.<br> - The old wellingtonian colors...<br> - Why have you told so many awful lies?<br> Because I don't like myself<br> the way I am, I suppose.<br> I've had to invent somebody else.<br> It's not too harmful, really.<br> We all have our daydreams.<br> Mine havejust gone a step<br> furtherthan most people's.<br> Sometimes... sometimes, I've even managed<br> to believe in "the Major" myself.<br> Well, I'd better get cracking,<br> I suppose.<br> Packing up after4 years<br> is hellish business, really.<br> Has to be done, though.<br> Well, if I don't see you again<br> before I go, I'll, ah...<br> I'll write and say goodbye.<br> - But where will you go?<br> - I don't really know.<br> There's a chap in London<br> who might up me up a couple of days.<br> Only, I don't really want to go there.<br> But why not?<br> Well, it's really rather a case of...<br> birds of a feather.<br> Oh, don't go to him.<br> Oh, you mustn't go to him.<br> - I don't really know where else.<br> - Another hotel.<br> Well, it can't be Bournemouth, you see,<br> or... or anywhere near here.<br> It would have to be London,<br> I suppose, and...<br> I don't know anywhere<br> there that I can afford.<br> - Well, I-I'll lend you some money.<br> - No, you certainly won't.<br> Y-yes, I can, I have<br> some savings certificates.<br> You can have those<br> and I can get you some more...<br> No, Sibyl.<br> No, thank you, but... but no,<br> I'll think of somewhere.<br> As a matter of fact, I'vejust<br> remember a place now, in Cheltenham.<br> L-it's a very pleasant spot.<br> I'll go and telephone them right away.<br> I hate to do this, but could you...<br> could you possibly lend me a sixpence?<br> Oh, oh, yes, of course, I can.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> Oh, but...<br> No, don't bother about me.<br> Don't worry, please.<br> I'll be perfectly all right. Please.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yes, thank you, I'm quite all right.<br> - Is there anything I can do to help?<br> - No... no, thank you.<br> I'm perfectly all right, thank you.<br> You're...<br> You're fond of him, aren't you?<br> No, I hate him, I despise him.<br> He's a vile, wicked man<br> and he's dome a horrible, beastly thing,<br> and it's not the first time, either.<br> He admitted that.<br> Oh, god, it's so horrible!<br> It's so horrible!<br> He says we're alike, he and I.<br> Did he?<br> He says we're both afraid of<br> life and people and... and sex.<br> There, I've said it.<br> I've said the word.<br> He says I hate saying it, even.<br> And I do! He's right,<br> I do, I do!<br> Please, try and control yourself.<br> Someone may come in.<br> Will he be all right, do you think?<br> Because, in spite of what he's done,<br> I don't want anything bad to happen to him.<br> I just want him to be happy.<br> I want him to find anotherfriend in his other hotel,<br> help him to forget his fright.<br> Do you think that he will?<br> I hope so.<br> So do I.<br> Oh, god, so do I!<br> Here's your sixpence.<br> I'm afraid that place was full up, but, ah...<br> I'll find something else.<br> Well, ah... goodbye, Sibyl.<br> God bless you.<br> I know perfectly well<br> what you must think of me.<br> Thank you for being so kind to her.<br> I have a couple of pipes here somewhere.<br> I bettertake them with me<br> I suppose. That's everything,<br> I think.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, yes, I'm all right.<br> I'm all right, Pat.<br> Well, what... th-that was a-a fine way<br> to behave, dashing out into the night.<br> - Where've you been?<br> - I don't know. I-I walked a long way.<br> How is she?<br> Is she all right?<br> - Your hands are like ice.<br> - What about her? Is she all right?<br> She's all right, John.<br> I'll get you some tea.<br> - Did I hurt her?<br> - No.<br> She was pretty hysterical last night,<br> but that was hardly surprising.<br> She fell, though, didn't she?<br> I seem to remember pushing her.<br> Herfalling, hitting her head...<br> She's all right, John.<br> Whateveryou did, there's been<br> no damage, no damage at all.<br> She's leaving this morning.<br> Did you ring, Miss?<br> Some tea for Mr. Malcolm, please.<br> - Tea? Just before breakfast?<br> - That will be all, Doreen.<br> Oh, okay, Doke.<br> We talked most of the night. I...<br> didn't want to get a doctor.<br> John, did you knowthat<br> she took drugs?<br> Drugs?<br> It's only the kind to make you sleep,<br> but she takes about 3 times the proper dose.<br> - The damn little fool.<br> - She takes them in the daytime, too.<br> Why does she do it?<br> Why do you go to the Feathers?<br> But I don't understand.<br> She was going to be married...<br> That's not true.<br> - But she told me.<br> - I'm simply telling you, that's not true.<br> Well, there's not much to choose<br> between you two is there?<br> When you're together,<br> you slash each otherto pieces,<br> and when you're apart,<br> you slash yourselves to pieces.<br> All told, it's quite a problem.<br> - I'm going to tell herthat you're here.<br> - No, Pat, don't do that.<br> I'lljust stay out of her way till she's gone.<br> - She's only waiting to hear how you are.<br> - You can tell her I'm all right.<br> You don't think perhaps<br> you might tell herthat yourself?<br> No, Pat, no.<br> It's your own business, of course.<br> I think if I was in your place, I'd want to.<br> You don't know<br> what it's like to be in my place.<br> You can't even guess.<br> O, yes, I think I can, John.<br> I said there was a refuge foryou here.<br> I was wrong. There is no refuge.<br> - There's no refuge from yourself.<br> - Stop it, Pat, please.<br> Listen, why won't you face facts?<br> Do you think I enjoy seeing your refuge<br> blow down overyour head?<br> After all, I've shared it with you<br> for a good many years.<br> In a way, I'm underthe debris, too, you know...<br> Pat, stop it, please.<br> I'm asking you to stop it.<br> Yes, all right. I'll stop it.<br> Here we are, all cozy now.<br> - Put it there, Doreen.<br> - Rightey-oh.<br> She'll have to go, that girl.<br> Pat... I'm sorry, but...<br> but give me one reason,<br> give mejust one good reason<br> why I should ever see her again?<br> All right. Just one then,<br> and god knows it's not for me to say it...<br> because you love her,<br> and she needs you.<br> What went on between you two last night?<br> How did she win you over?<br> She didn't win me over,<br> John, for heaven's sake.<br> Feeling the way I do,<br> do you think she could?<br> Anyway, to do herjustice,<br> she didn't even try.<br> I could see her as she is, all right. I...<br> I think all you've evertold me<br> about her is probably true.<br> She is vain and spoiled<br> and selfish and deceitful.<br> Of course, with... you being in love with her,<br> you see all those things as sort of...<br> monstrous sins.<br> I see them as ordinary faults.<br> I don't like them,<br> but it doesn't stop me being sorry<br> for a woman who's ill and lonely...<br> and desperately in need of help.<br> Well, shall...<br> I tell herthat you're here?<br> No.<br> No, Pat.<br> Just let her go back to her own life, and...<br> leave me here to live mine in peace.<br> Well, that would be fine, John,<br> If you tell mejust one little thing...<br> what sort of peace you<br> living in down here?<br> Is it even living?<br> - Is it, John?<br> - It'll do.<br> Thank you. At this moment,<br> I don't think I could have borne tact.<br> Well, if... If you won't face her,<br> there's the door, and outside's the street,<br> and down the street is the Feathers.<br> It's a bit early,<br> but I'm sure they'll open up foryou.<br> Come in.<br> - I'm so sorry, you're busy.<br> - No, Major, come in. It's all right.<br> - Well, I can come back.<br> - That's all right, Major, I wasjust leaving,<br> I've already taken up more of<br> Miss Cooper's time than I deserve.<br> I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have barged in.<br> I'm afraid I've upset him.<br> No, you didn't upset him.<br> Now, what can I do foryou, Major?<br> It'sjust, if you don't mind, to, ah...<br> to get my bill ready.<br> I want to make it perfectly plain, Major.<br> That there's no question whatever<br> of my asking you to leave this hotel.<br> If you wish to stay,<br> you're perfectly at liberty to do so.<br> Well, that's very good of you, but, ah...<br> of course, I have to go.<br> Very well.<br> I'll send you a forwarding address<br> when I... when I get something fixed.<br> I hate to bring this up, but...<br> would you mind very much if I...<br> hid here in your office when I bring my bags down?<br> - I don't awfully want to...<br> - Of course.<br> And thank you for being so kind.<br> God knows I don't deserve it,<br> but I'm... I'm very grateful.<br> I do wish you'd change<br> your mind.<br> Miss Cooper,<br> the plain fact is that...<br> I'm fartoo much of a coward<br> to stay on here now.<br> At least you wouldn't be forced<br> into any more of that 'Major" stuff, would you?<br> I might be forced into something<br> a good deal more... inclusive.<br> Cleaning the old service revolver, perhaps.<br> Make a nasty mess on one of your carpets<br> and bring an ugly scandal to your hotel.<br> I'd take the risk, it you would.<br> You're thinking of Sibyl, of course?<br> Sibyl, too, yes.<br> Not a hope.<br> Not a hope in the whole blinking wide world.<br> I know my form, you see.<br> Still, that is the part about it that I...<br> that I hate the most.<br> She's distinctly an odd one, almost a case...<br> mind of a child and all that.<br> And yet, she means quite a...<br> quiet a lot to me.<br> I ratherthink you mean<br> a lot to her, too.<br> I would like to think so.<br> You know, one's awfully apt<br> to try and excuse oneself sometimes by saying,<br> 'well, what I do doesn't do<br> anybody else much harm.'<br> But one does, you see.<br> And that's not a thought that I like very much.<br> Well, mustn't miss<br> the old train, what, what?<br> I must... I must stop saying 'what.'<br> Cheery-bye.<br> Better stop doing that, too,<br> I suppose.<br> Charles...<br> Oh, Charles, you were asleep.<br> Darling, I just can't go on like this.<br> I just simply can't<br> Like what?<br> Well, y-you'vejust got to marry me<br> so I can get some sleep.<br> I'm never going to<br> pass these exams.<br> All right.<br> What?<br> All right, we'll be married.<br> Jean.<br> Well, after all, if really isn't<br> going to make the slightest bit of difference.<br> First of all, we'd better call my mother<br> so she can get started on the arrangements.<br> Oh, and you'd better call<br> yourfather in Liverpool.<br> Charles, how many children<br> do you think we should have?<br> I think maybe 3 to start, don't you?<br> Y-yes, dear.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Malcolm.<br> - Good morning, Miss Meacham.<br> - Are you all right, Ann?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - I was worried about you.<br> - You shouldn't have been.<br> - Toast, Mrs. Shankland?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Haddock or boiled egg?<br> - Just coffee, please.<br> I'm glad you came in.<br> It gives me a chance to say<br> how sorry I am I had to lie to you.<br> Tell me something, Ann.<br> When you say you need me,<br> is it me that you need, or...<br> orjust my love?<br> Because if it's my love,<br> you must knowthat you have that.<br> - It's you, John.<br> - Why? Why?<br> I suppose because<br> you're all the things I'm not.<br> You're honest and true and...<br> dependable and sincere and...<br> virtues that I don't have anymore.<br> So you see, Ann,<br> I could never satisfy your need.<br> And I knowthat you could<br> never satisfy mine.<br> I would nevertry to again.<br> I won't botheryou anymore.<br> Going back to New York?<br> I suppose so.<br> You must have friends there...<br> hundreds of acquaintances.<br> You know betterthan that, John.<br> It's hard to believe, but...<br> you can be more alone<br> in New York than... in this hotel.<br> Even with their separate tables,<br> they can talk back and forth.<br> Being alone in a crowd is worse.<br> It's more painful, more frightening.<br> So frightening, J...<br> So frightening.<br> I'm an awful coward, you see, I...<br> I've never been able to face anything alone...<br> being ill, having operations and all that, and...<br> now I can't even facejust...<br> just getting old.<br> Oh, that damn waitress will come<br> back and catch me crying.<br> - How did you sleep, dear?<br> - Oh, not at all well...<br> that dreadful business<br> about the Major.<br> I know. Never wracking, isn't it?<br> I'm utterly shattered, myself.<br> Poached eggs foryou, isn't it?<br> You should know by now<br> that Miss Railton-Bell<br> never has anything but<br> a poached egg for breakfast.<br> I forget things, dear.<br> That's my trouble.<br> There you are.<br> Eat your egg, dear.<br> You don't want people to think that you're still<br> upset overthat horrible man, how do you?<br> No, mummy.<br> Sorry, Major, there's been a muddle.<br> I'll lay yourtable right away.<br> Mabel, no, 7's in.<br> You said he was out.<br> Well, that's what Edgar said.<br> Edgar said he was leaving.<br> - Haddock? It's nice this morning.<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> There we are.<br> All cozy now.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> - Lovely day, isn't it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> Should be fine forthe course.<br> If the weather holds up,<br> I may be able to give you a winnertomorrow.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I may not be here tomorrow.<br> I see.<br> It's suddenly turned very cold<br> in here, dear, don't you think?<br> I think I shall move my chair around<br> out of the draft.<br> Good morning.<br> Have you seen the latest, ah, cricket score?<br> No, I haven't.<br> We're doing rather well.<br> Australia all out 246.<br> - Oh, I am glad to hearthat.<br> - Yes, it is encouraging, isn't it?<br> Well, really.<br> Good morning.<br> Gladys.<br> I, ah... I hope you're having the haddock,<br> it's delicious.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Good.<br> Come, Sibyl.<br> - I haven't finished yet.<br> - It doesn't matter, dear.<br> Come with me into the lounge.<br> No, mummy.<br> Sibyl, come with me at once.<br> No, mummy. I'm going to stay here<br> in the dining room and finish my breakfast.<br> I sawthe new moon<br> through glass last night.<br> Did you, indeed?<br> Some people think that's unlucky,<br> don't they?<br> Yes, they do.<br> But then, I don't believe<br> in superstition. Do you?<br> No, as a matter of fact,<br> I, Ah... I don't.<br> You know, don't you, Ann,<br> that we don't have very much hope together.<br> Have we all that much apart?<br> Good morning, lady Matheson.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> Edgar says yourtaxi has arrived,<br> Mr. Pollock.<br> Ask him to send it away again,<br> would you, please?<br> Very well.<br> Lunch at the usual time then.<br> Lunch at the usual time then.<br> Alynabawy@Hotmail.Com<br> analazyz@yahoo.com<br>
