Whoa, Noah.<br> But old Satan, he hangs on tight.<br> You and the Lord could throw him, Alvin.<br> Why, twixt the two of you,<br> you'd have old Satan down in a jiffy.<br> Why, I sure wish the Lord would throw in.<br> He will, if you ask him.<br> Oh, I done prayed, Pastor,<br> till I was black in the face.<br> - But it wasn't no use. - It ain't only<br> praying, Alvin, it's believing.<br> Now, you see here.<br> Take a look at the old oak yonder.<br> Looks mighty strong.<br> Been standing there since your pa<br> was a boy a-plowing in the same field.<br> Looks like it could go right on standing<br> all by itself, don't it?<br> Yep.<br> Just a-resting itself<br> and feeding on the earth.<br> Well, it can't. It can't stand there<br> Without there's a lot of deep roots<br> a- holding it up.<br> Can't see the roots,<br> but they're there just the same.<br> It appears to me it's been planned<br> a fellow's got to have his roots<br> In something outside his own self.<br> I reckon I ain't found no roots<br> what'll hold me up, when...<br> When I'm hell-bent to fall.<br> And then take the animals in the woods.<br> Squirrels'd go mighty hungry<br> If nothing made 'em store up nuts<br> for the wintertime.<br> - Sure would.<br> - How do you reckon<br> Birds get to fly north in the summer<br> if there ain't something a-guiding 'em?<br> A bird ain't got no way of telling<br> north from south.<br> And then there's the bees.<br> Bees'd sure be in a fix<br> if they wasn't beholding to something<br> To show 'em how to get back to the hives.<br> Well, I ain't no bird and<br> I ain't no squirrel.<br> - And I sure ain't no bee.<br> - Well, that's right, Alvin.<br> The way I figure,<br> there ain't no use for a fellow<br> going out looking for religion. It's...<br> Well, it's just gotta come to a fellow.<br> It'll come, my boy.

And there's one more thing.<br> I'm asking your forgiveness<br> for a-flaring up at you the way I done.<br> It were Satan a-speaking out of me.<br> Zeke was a-telling me, but I...<br> l couldn't believe him.<br> - About what?<br> - That you got religion.<br> - Well, that's a fact, Mr. Tomkins.<br> - Well, I'll be damned.<br> Well, I sure would like to be a-buying<br> that there mule back.<br> - You would, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How much would you be asking for him?<br> - Well, let's see.<br> You said he was worth $40<br> and I allowed you $30.<br> That's right.<br> Well, you can have him back for $20.<br> Mr. Tomkins, Abraham's worth<br> a sight more than that.<br> Maybe he is,<br> But seeing as how I'm trying to do<br> the fair and square thing, Alvin, $20.<br> I reckon I know what you're thinking.<br> lt's more blessed to give than to receive.<br> Maybe. Come on, get your mule.<br> And another thing, I'm gonna<br> give you back the clock you sold me.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah, it don't run nohow.<br> - Howdy, Mr. Andrews.<br> - Howdy.<br> I'd kind of like to see Zeb,<br> are he hereabout?<br> Maybe he is.<br> I sure would like to have words with him.<br> You coming peaceful?<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Andrews.<br> l ain't looking for no trouble.<br> Zeb.

I couldn't see.<br> I didn't have no call<br> to come twixt you and him.<br> What are you getting at, Alvin York?<br> All I'm aiming to say, Miss Gracie, is,<br> A upstanding man like Zeb Andrews<br> would make a girl a right smart husband.<br> - What's that?<br> - And...<br> And if you change your mind about Zeb,<br> well, I reckon I could...<br> - You could what?<br> - I could rightly understand.<br> Oh, you could, could you?<br> Lookee here, Alvin York,<br> If I wanted Zeb Andrews for a husband,<br> I reckon I could get him<br> without your acting so noble.<br> - I done kissed you, didn't I?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, I don't go around kissing men<br> l ain't gonna be a-marrying.<br> Now you be a-listening to me.<br> - Am I marrying a piece of land?<br> - Yes. No.<br> - Or a beef critter?<br> - No.<br> Or a field of corn?<br> No, it's you I'm marrying,<br> ain't nobody else in this here world.<br> - Are you hearing me?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, then don't you talk that way<br> to me again, Alvin!<br> - No.<br> - Don't you ever!<br> Oh!<br> The Lord sure do move<br> in mysterious ways.<br> So that's what the Lord done said to Cain<br> when he done killed Abel.<br> It was a way of telling him<br> that he wouldn't get no crops no more.<br> And anybody that's a farmer<br> knows what that means.<br> Alvin, how do you know that it happened<br> just that-a-way?<br> A- seeing how you weren't there.<br> Well, the Book says so.<br> And there ain't nothing written<br> in the Book that ain't the truth.<br> So, a long time after that<br> When the Lord was a-giving Moses<br> the Ten Commandments,<br> He was a-saying, "Thou shalt not kill."<br> Now...

In a way I agree with you.<br> York, with your permission, Major?<br> Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.<br> You... You say you believe in the Bible?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, I do, too.<br> But do you believe that the Bible means<br> that a man shouldn't fight<br> For what he believes to be right?<br> Well, it done said,<br> "Blessed are the peacemakers."<br> Yes, I know, but...<br> You remember that verse,<br> l think it's in Luke,<br> Where he says, "He that hath no sword,<br> let him sell his garment, and buy one"?<br> He said that to Peter.<br> But he doesn't stop Peter<br> from using his sword.<br> He said, "Them that lives by the sword<br> will be a-perishing by the sword."<br> That were further on.<br> - Yes, I remember, but...<br> - No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.<br> But according to St. John,<br> He said, "My kingdom is not of this world.<br> "lf my kingdom were of this world,<br> then would my servant fight."<br> Well, that's just the point, Captain.<br> He done said<br> his kingdom were not of this world.<br> And that...

Go ahead.<br> Thank you.<br> Come on.<br> Forward!<br> All right. Halt!<br> Prisoners, hold right there!<br> Be a-watching 'em, Joe.<br> Beg your pardon, sir.<br> Yeah?<br> We all got some prisoners,<br> can we be a-leaving 'em here?<br> Put 'em right over there.<br> Wait a minute.<br> How many have you got?<br> Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.<br> We haven't room for that many here.<br> Take them back up the line.<br> - Yes, sir, but...<br> - But what?<br> Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we<br> tried to drop 'em off two other places.<br> And they ain't but only eight of us<br> to handle them.<br> - You should've brought more men.<br> - But that's all there were of us, sir.<br> You mean to say that you<br> and seven others captured all that bunch?<br> Yes, sir.<br> And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.<br> Well, good Lord.<br> I guess we can give you some help.<br> - Come on, Sergeant.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hey, Sarge! York by himself<br> captured 132 Germans.<br> Guy named York got 132 Heinies<br> all by his lonesome.<br> - How did he do it?<br> - Must have surrounded him.<br> - Guy named York.<br> - That's what they say.<br> Gee, he captured<br> hundreds of Boche and machine guns.<br> Guy named York! All by his lonesome!<br> Hey, what's that? How many?<br> A whole division and a lot of high officers.<br> - I'm telling you, York?<br> - Who's they?<br> Yeah, about half the German army<br> and a general.<br> - I don't know.<br> - One guy.<br> How could one guy...<br> - Guy named York.<br> - What's that?<br> They say he captured Hindenburg.<br> And the Crown Prince.<br> And brought them all back. They say...<br> Say, Sarge, did you hear?<br> York captured the Kaiser.<br> Now, as I understand it, York,<br> your detail came over that ridge there<br> and captured about 30 men,<br> right down in here.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then you were forced to cover<br> by a machine gun<br> That was right up on this other ridge.<br> Yes, sir. Right up there.<br> Where were you?<br> Well, I was...<br> l was a-laying behind that log there.<br> They was machine-gunning us<br> pretty heavy, so I worked my way across<br> Up behind that log there under the hill.<br> Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,<br> Your being able to cross so much<br> open ground without being hit?<br> I reckon the good Lord<br> was a-protecting me, sir.<br> What did you wanna go over there for?<br> Well, I figured that was a good place to be<br> Because they had to rear up<br> and show themselves<br> In order to shoot at me<br> and the rest of the boys back here.<br> And whenever they did,<br> l could touch 'em off.<br> I see.<br> So, I went up the hill,<br> up around that a-way,<br> Then worked my way down the ridge<br> to a place where they was flanked<br> And couldn't show themselves<br> without being hit.<br> So, they... Well, they finally gave up.<br> How many did you kill?<br> I don't rightly know, sir.<br> I think Captain Danforth<br> is familiar with that, sir.<br> We counted about 20 bodies altogether<br> up around there.<br> What were your men doing<br> all this time, Corporal?<br> Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.<br> I was pretty busy<br> and I reckon they was, too.<br> According to the statements of the others,<br> they were guarding the prisoners<br> And couldn't expose themselves<br> to the fire from the ridge.<br> All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.<br> Corporal.<br> - There's something that I'd like to know.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> That night that you reported back to me<br> at Camp Gordon,<br> You as much as told me that you were<br> quite prepared to die for your country,<br> But not to kill.<br> What made you<br> decide to change your mind?<br> Well, sir...<br> Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,<br> why, it's quite all right.<br> Well, I'm as much against killing as ever,<br> sir.<br> But it was this way, Colonel.<br> When I started out I<br> felt just like you said.<br> But when I hear them<br> machine guns a-going<br> And all them fellows<br> are dropping around me,<br> I figured that them guns<br> was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,<br> And there weren't nothing anybody<br> could do, but to stop them guns.<br> And that's what I done.<br> You mean to tell me<br> that you did it to save lives?<br> Yes, sir. That was why.<br> Well, York, what you've just told me<br> is the most extraordinary thing of all.<br> Sergeant York!<br> Thank you, sir.<br> And for conspicuous gallantry<br> beyond the call of duty,<br> You have been awarded<br> the Distinguished Service Cross.<br> Sergeant York, I am proud that<br> you are of the All-American Division.<br> It's a privilege to command<br> such men as you.<br> Sergeant York,<br> As Commander-in-Chief<br> of the American Expeditionary Forces,<br> It is my pleasure to confer upon you<br> The United States<br> Congressional Medal of Honor<br> For heroism beyond the call of duty.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,<br> Representative from<br> your district of Tennessee.<br> I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.<br> And this is Mr. Harrison<br> from the Tennessee Society.<br> Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.<br> - Thank you.<br> - This way, Sergeant.<br> Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?<br> Appears like everybody's<br> having a mighty good time.<br> So, Sergeant,<br> in the name of the people of New York,<br> May I present you with this key to our city<br> As a token of our very great esteem.<br> And may God bless you.<br> Thank you for what you said,<br> And I'm sure grateful to you<br> for this here key.<br> Well, thank you. And thank you all.<br> Now, Sergeant, the people of New York<br> would like to show their appreciation.<br> Is there anything we can do for you?<br> Well, there's just one thing<br> I'd like to ask you.<br> And that is?<br> Well, if it's all the same to everybody,<br> I sure would like to ride on the subway<br> on the Bronx Express.<br> I think we can arrange that.<br> Well, here we are.<br> I hope you will be comfortable here,<br> Sergeant York.<br> Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty<br> hard to please.<br> If there's anything you require,<br> all you will have to do is ask for it.<br> Thank you. Thank you, sir.<br> An awful lot of room<br> for just one fellow here.<br> This here is mighty thoughtful of you,<br> gentlemen.<br> I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma<br> for quite a spell.<br> So we understand.<br> Representative Hull.<br> Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?<br> Put them on.<br> - Somebody for you, Sergeant.<br> - Me?<br> Thank you.<br> Hello. Hello there.<br> What?<br> Who is it?<br> I... I can't hear you.<br> - Who is it?<br> - What's that you're saying?<br> I can't hear you.<br> Put it up to your ear, Mother York.<br> Stand closer, Ma.<br> When are you coming home, Alvin?<br> I said, when are you coming home?<br> Oh, I'm glad, Son.<br> I'll tell her.<br> She's right here.<br> He wants to talk to you, Gracie.<br> It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!<br> We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.<br> He's got this here phone in here now.<br> Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,<br> Alvin.<br> I can't wait to see you.<br> Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie,<br> right away.<br> Yeah.<br> - Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.<br> - Goodbye, Alvin.<br> Bye.<br> Sure was nice to talk to the folks.<br> - I'm a-thanking you.<br> - You're welcome, Sergeant.<br> Just like the electric signs<br> down the street.<br> How do you like New York, Alvin,<br> as much as you've seen of it?<br> - Mr. Hull?<br> - Yes, Alvin?<br> I wanna be a-going home.<br> When do you think I can go?<br> - You're pretty anxious, I reckon.<br> - Yes, sir, I am.<br> I've got to get to work.<br> Well, as far as that goes,<br> there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.<br> What do you mean?<br> I've been wanting<br> to talk to you about this.<br> You're a pretty famous man now.<br> And judging by all these offers<br> you've been getting,<br> It seems a lot of people realize it.<br> For instance,<br> Two companies want you<br> in motion pictures,<br> Ziegfeld wants you in an act<br> in his new<br> And here's an offer to appear<br> at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.<br> And here's a breakfast food manufacturer<br> who wants you to endorse his product.<br> What does that mean?<br> Well, you've to tell him how much<br> you like it, how much good it's done you.<br> I ain't never ate<br> any of that there breakfast food.<br> Doesn't seem to make any difference.<br> Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far<br> And they amount to around<br> a quarter of million dollars.<br> They're offering me all that money?<br> It's just a plain business proposition.<br> I sure could do a powerful sight<br> with that money.<br> There was a piece of bottomland<br> l was a-trying to get...<br> Here's your chance to get it.<br> Are they offering that money<br> because of what happened over there?<br> - Well...<br> - That's it, ain't it?<br> That's it.<br> What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?<br> Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.<br> I reckon it is.<br> Take all the time you want to think it over.<br> I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.<br> I ain't proud of what happened over there.<br> What we done in France<br> was something we had to do.<br> Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.<br> So, the way I figure, things like<br> that ain't for buying and selling.<br> So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.<br> Would you be a-telling them that<br> for me, please?<br> And tell 'em I'm a-going home?<br> - I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Hull.<br> Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.<br> Oh, there he is!<br> Alvin!<br> Oh, Alvin!<br> How are you?<br> Ma, I'm back.<br> I'm right glad, Son.<br> Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?<br> - What about 'em, George?<br> - I thought you'd be wearing 'em.<br> You'll be a-seeing 'em.<br> They better be a-something big.<br> As I was saying, Alvin,<br> Of course, I always figured<br> on marrying you and Gracie myself,<br> But I ain't one to take the job away<br> from the Governor of the State.<br> Why, you're the dang-swangest hero<br> raised in these parts<br> Since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.<br> Sure are, Alvin.<br> Hang on, Rosie.<br> Hey,<br> What about that there piece of land<br> l was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?<br> - It's still there, I reckon?<br> - Yep, it's still there.<br> Somebody else has got it by now,<br> l suppose.<br> Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb<br> to hold it for me all this time.<br> I sure would like to see that there<br> piece of land, though.<br> I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.<br> I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.<br> I'll let you off at the fork and<br> you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.<br> Hang on, everyone.<br> Hey, look here.<br> - Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.<br> - Yeah, they have.<br> Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.<br> It wasn't just the land<br> l was a-wanting to see.<br> There's something we got to talk about.<br> - Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.<br> - What about, Alvin?<br> Well, what with the governor fixing<br> to marry us<br> And all them people coming here<br> from all over...<br> Sure takes a body's breath away,<br> but I reckon we'll get through it all right.<br> - Well, it ain't just that I'm worried<br> about. - Well, what then?<br> Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing<br> to offer you excepting a big wedding.<br> Why, some girls don't even get that.<br> Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep,<br> wouldn't you?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I done a heap of sleeping<br> while you was away.<br> You sure ain't expecting<br> too much of a husband.<br> I'm expecting my husband to love me.<br> I reckon the good Lord<br> will take care of the rest.<br> Well, looks like he's done a heap already,<br> Just a-having you. But...<br> Well, I was expecting to take over<br> from here myself.<br> I reckon you'll get to do your share.<br> No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.<br> We got to wait.<br> Maybe in another two or three years,<br> if you're willing to wait...<br> Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.<br> - You mean you won't wait?<br> - There ain't no need of waiting.<br> Now, Alvin, you keep looking down<br> and don't you be looking up till I tell you.<br> Come on.<br> There! Now you can look.<br> What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.<br> It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.<br> They give it to you.<br> The people of the state of Tennessee<br> for what you done.<br> - You mean...<br> - Only, it's 200 acres<br> And the house is bigger, with more<br> windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.<br> And it's for us.<br> The Lord sure does move<br> in mysterious ways.<br> Come on.<br> Boris J. -jambrob.<br>
