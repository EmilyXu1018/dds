That's what I see.<br> - You don't look so hot yourself.<br> - What's all this shit over here?<br> Get ready to blow up again,<br> 'cause I got another idea.<br> You and your ideas<br> are as full of shit as you are.<br> - Right on cue.<br> - Right on cue.<br> We can talk to Foreman,<br> the commissioner of investigations.<br> Another guy!<br> We got another guy here.<br> We could even talk to a guy<br> I know on the New York Times.<br> Oh, that's terrific.<br> Go to the Times.<br> Every time I talk to you, Blair,<br> This is safe, Frank.<br> It's safe? With my ass on the line,<br> it's safe, right?<br> - Your ass is already on the line!<br> - That's my business!<br> - You don't trust me, Frank?<br> - I don't trust you!<br> - Go fuckyourself!<br> - Fuckyou!<br> Look, when I come home,<br> I want a house clean.<br> - Don't take it out on me, Paco.<br> - I don't want to pick up shit!<br> Honey...<br> come to bed.<br> All right. Look, we all know<br> what this is about, right?<br> Frank, what the hell was happening<br> between you and Don Rubello?<br> Simple. I didn't take any money.<br> I don't take money.<br> Rubello said if I changed my mind,<br> he'd hold my share...<br> he'd give it back to me.<br> - I didn't change my mind.<br> - The conniving bastard.<br> - All right. I'll handle Rubello.<br> - Donny was stealing.<br> I'll get back the money he took.<br> But this ain't gonna happen again.<br> From now on, no more three bagmen.<br> Starting today, every one ofyou...<br> makes his own collections-<br> no stops, no bread, okay?<br> - Right.<br> - You got it.<br> What about you, Frankie?<br> I'll make up what Don took from you.<br> - Why should I start now?<br> - Everybody'd feel better about you.<br> You can always give it<br> to charity.<br> Look, Frankie, what do you say,<br> a hundred a month just for expenses?<br> For my secretary and my<br> business lunches, entertainment?<br> All right. All right.<br> We split Frank's share from now on.<br> You're a schmuck, Frank.<br> If they would take<br> all that energy, see...<br> put it into<br> straight police work...<br> we'd have the city<br> cleaned up in a week.<br> They'd clean up.<br> There'd be no crime.<br> If I could work alone-<br> That's the thing, see?<br> If I could just get- Work alone.<br> But they don't like that.<br> They don't want that.<br> They want to suckyou in.<br> You go over<br> the same thing, Paco.<br> So fucking corrupt. Everybody,<br> everyone. Nobody giving a shit!<br> There's gotta be a way<br> to wipe it out, goddamn it.<br> Let's get out of here for a while,<br> huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.<br> Quit handling me! What are you<br> doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?<br> They'd kill me if they knew!<br> You think that hasn't happened?<br> Eitheryou're exploding, oryou're<br> Iying around like a catatonic!<br> - I can't stand it, Paco.<br> - You don't give a shit, right?<br> All I care about is you!<br> That's all that matters to me.<br> That's why it hurts so much.<br> I can't stand to see you like this...<br> Scared, miserable,<br> dreading to go to work.<br> It's tearing me apart!<br> And then I get sick of hearing<br> about it, and I start hating myself.<br> You didn't like my being a cop,<br> so don't give me that shit.<br> I love you! I want to marry you!<br> I want to have children with you!<br> - Goddamn it! I hate it!<br> - Why don't you get out?<br> - Why don't you?<br> - It's crossed my mind.<br> Well, do it.<br> - What do you got?<br> - Would you bust whitey?<br> Try me. Try me.<br> This guy's heavy.<br> He's Italian.<br> Mobbed up.<br> Still interested?<br> Stop fuckin' around.<br> I'm not in the mood. Come on.<br> He's a loan shark,<br> runs a big numbers operation.<br> This mother's so cocksure...<br> he picks up his own slips<br> while he's collecting his loans.<br> Where's the drop?<br> Hold it!<br> I'm a police officer.<br> And...<br> Wait a minute.<br> You're under arrest.<br> - I thought you were a junkie.<br> - I'll take that wad in your pocket.<br> - You're a riot, kid.<br> - I know. I'm a joke.<br> What are you doin'?<br> What's that?<br> Put that away, oryou're in more<br> trouble. Give me your car keys.<br> Where they been<br> hiding you, kid?<br> Wouldn't you like to know?<br> Hold this guy for booking.<br> Get a rap sheet on him.<br> I'm gonna search his car.<br> Where's Corsaro?<br> Smith took him upstairs.<br> I swear to God, I thought this guy<br> was some fucking junkie.<br> Listen, Rudy, you should<br> see some of the...<br> - Hey, you.<br> - Hey, who?<br> You. Get over here<br> and empty your pockets.<br> - I don't do that.<br> - You're my prisoner. Do what I say.<br> - Get over here.<br> - He's gonna get nasty about it.<br> You're fucking right!<br> Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?<br> Lean, motherfuck!<br> Spread!<br> Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.<br> He's good people.<br> Stay the fuck outta this!<br> You fuck!<br> What's this?<br> What's this?<br> Get in! Get in!<br> Serpico.<br> Got that record check on Corsaro.<br> You want to read something?<br> It's about your pal Corsaro.<br> Here, read it.<br> Read it!<br> He did 15 years.<br> You know what for?<br> For killing a cop.<br> He's a fucking cop killer.<br> - It's good to see you again.<br> - I've had it. I'm finished.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - I can't take it. I gotta get out.<br> If I have to go back to uniform,<br> I'm going back to uniform.<br> I can't wait for Delaney to call.<br> I can't play their game anymore.<br> The commissioner didn't<br> get in touch with you?<br> Not a word. No investigation,<br> no undercover work, nothing!<br> - I had no idea, Frank.<br> - It's only fair to tell you.<br> I've been to outside agencies.<br> I'll go to more if I have to.<br> What outside agencies?<br> Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash<br> our own laundry around here!<br> - You could be brought up on charges!<br> - We do not wash our own laundry!<br> - It just gets dirtier!<br> - You are in trouble!<br> I don't care if I'm in trouble.<br> I don't care who gets it.<br> - If I have to go to outside agencies-<br> - Stay away from outside agencies!<br> - Where am I gonna go?<br> - You hear me?<br> - Where am I gonna go?<br> - Wait until you hear from me.<br> - I've been waiting for 11/2 years.<br> - I'll get back to you.<br> That's not enough!<br> Where am I gonna go?<br> It's my life, you fuck!<br> Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.<br> For this precinct,<br> cases reported...<br> Murder- 14 for August,<br> Inspector Palmer?<br> Deputy Chief Inspector Daley<br> and Inspector Gilbert...<br> are waiting to see you.<br> You want to come<br> to my office?<br> Captain McCIain called me.<br> I briefed Inspector Daley<br> and Inspector Gilbert...<br> on your allegations.<br> The question is, in all these<br> months, why didn't you come to us?<br> Well...<br> I never met these gentlemen<br> before, sir, and...<br> you told...<br> I mean,<br> you told Captain McCIain...<br> that the division was as clean<br> as a hound's tooth.<br> You think you're the only honest cop<br> on the force, Serpico?<br> My record's clear.<br> Inspector Gilbert's just<br> come from the commissioner's...<br> confidential<br> investigation unit.<br> Then you must have<br> heard something. I mean...<br> I don't understand.<br> Commissioner Delaney has known<br> about this from the beginning.<br> No, I didn't hear a thing.<br> But I understand<br> your frustration, Frank...<br> believe me.<br> I mean, it's sort of like<br> trying to punch your way...<br> out of a paper bag,<br> right?<br> What outside agencies<br> have you been to, Frank?<br> I don't see how that's pertinent<br> to my allegations.<br> We ought to ask Serpico directly<br> if he's gonna cooperate or not.<br> - Come on.<br> - We've gotta know...<br> if there's any real basis<br> for an investigation.<br> Well, I...<br> I'll have to think that...<br> I'm gonna have to think<br> about that.<br> What is there<br> to think about?<br> I don't see how the division<br> can investigate itself, sir.<br> You've got a point there.<br> But you would cooperate with<br> an impartial investigation, right?<br> Yeah. Up to a point.<br> As long as I'm not involved.<br> I just want to go someplace<br> where I can do my job.<br> That's fair enough.<br> We'll be in touch.<br> Inspector Palmer?<br> May I see you a minute?<br> Was it necessary to let everyone<br> in the station house...<br> know I was comin' in here<br> to see these guys?<br> You believe from what you now know<br> that a full-scale investigation...<br> is warranted?<br> - Yes, Commissioner Delaney.<br> - Go to it.<br> But, sir...<br> shouldn't headquarters<br> handle something like this?<br> No.<br> You're all experienced men.<br> Chief Gallagher here will be<br> available for consultation.<br> Commissioner...<br> Serpico claims that...<br> McCIain talked to you about<br> this whole thing some time ago.<br> Yes. I seem to remember<br> something about that.<br> We can't set up a surveillance on<br> "somewhere over by Crotona Park."<br> We need a location!<br> I've given you 36 locations<br> that are paying off.<br> Now, what do you want? The whole<br> thing signed, sealed, delivered?<br> You're conducting this<br> investigation, not me.<br> Lieutenant Smith-<br> Let's get back to him.<br> Lieutenant Smith.<br> Lieutenant Smith said to me...<br> if I didn't want the money that<br> he would stash it in his attic.<br> I'll have him transferred<br> in the morning.<br> Fuck him.<br> How about transferring me?<br> I hear you been<br> vouchering pad money...<br> over to a confidential<br> investigation squad.<br> Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money<br> when I don't take any?<br> You won't find anything<br> on Serpico.<br> He's clean.<br> Right?<br> You practicing your frisk?<br> I'm looking to buy<br> a used tape recorder.<br> They're feeling me up every day.<br> How am I gonna wear a wire?<br> Come on, Frank.<br> Wearing a wire means testifying to<br> corroborate the tape, right? Right.<br> I'm not testifying.<br> I gotta put a dime<br> in the parking meter.<br> Ragland, put a dime<br> in the parking meter for Serpico.<br> Hey, Frank. Frank, you know<br> Herman Tauber, district attorney?<br> Yeah, I watch television.<br> Frank, I want to compliment you<br> for coming forward like this.<br> It's unique.<br> It's uniquely unique.<br> You should be proud of yourself.<br> There's gonna be a grand jury<br> on these shitheels...<br> with Frank Serpico<br> as my star witness.<br> Mr. Tauber, you and everybody<br> in this room can go to hell...<br> 'cause I'm not testifying.<br> - Listen-<br> - Wait just a second, Frank.<br> You have nothing to fear.<br> You're not gonna be singled out.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> I don't give a fuck who knows...<br> - Wait a minute-<br> - if it meant something...<br> - but this investigation is bullshit.<br> - Mind if I say something?<br> Bullshit. You're not going after<br> corruption in the department...<br> the division, the Bronx.<br> A few flunky cops<br> thrown to the wolves...<br> to protect Delaney and those guys<br> who've known about this for years...<br> and won't do a fuckin' thing about<br> it, that's why I won't testify.<br> - Hey, what's this?<br> - Exactly what it says.<br> I'm splitting.<br> "Splitting." I never read<br> anything so stupid in my life.<br> "I'm leaving. If you want to<br> discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."<br> I didn't feel like another<br> blood-and-guts scene.<br> I figured you wouldn't<br> be able to shout in here.<br> I can shout anywhere!<br> I won't shout.<br> Sit down, sit down.<br> It's just gonna go on<br> and on, Paco.<br> It isn't gonna<br> get any better.<br> And if you quit,<br> somehow I'll be blamed.<br> How could you leave<br> the man you love...<br> future father of your kids?<br> You never said anything<br> like that to me before.<br> And if I come back,<br> you won't say it again.<br> You want to be free<br> and unattached...<br> to go on fighting for your cause<br> and keep torturing yourself.<br> My cause.<br> I felt so safe with you...<br> so loving.<br> Stay with me, Laurie.<br> - Come on. Stay with me.<br> - No, no.<br> - What do I owe you for that?<br> - Excuse me.<br> Here.<br> Here's $2:00.<br> What are you doing?<br> Do you want to walk away,<br> or should I?<br> I'm not gonna walk away.<br> It's finished!<br> Who do you think you are, trying to<br> pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?<br> Chief Green,<br> I know your reputation.<br> Look, maybe if you were borough<br> commanderwhen this thing started...<br> run this investigation yourself,<br> I'd feel different about testifying.<br> But the truth is,<br> you're coming in after the fact.<br> You're like a quiffwho says<br> she won't, then maybe she will.<br> I'm like a quiff<br> who's been fucked over...<br> for a year and a half by guys like<br> Kellogg, McCIain, Delaney...<br> I'm not Kellogg,<br> McCIain or Delaney!<br> Frank, it won't be<br> just flunky cops.<br> This is only the beginning.<br> This could be the biggest thing...<br> - since the Harry Gross case.<br> - And meanwhile, where am I?<br> I'm out there alone.<br> Who gives a fuck about that?<br> I'm totally isolated in the<br> department. I don't have a friend.<br> Don't give me that bullshit. I've<br> been puttin' cops away for 30 years!<br> My name's an obscenity on every<br> precinct shithouse wall in the city.<br> - I've observed that, sir.<br> - Friends! I fought my way up...<br> as a Jew in the department in the<br> days you were supposed to have...<br> an uncircumcised shamrock<br> between your legs.<br> I have this nightmare<br> I'm on 5th Avenue...<br> watching the St. Patrick's Day<br> parade and I have a coronary...<br> and 9,000 cops<br> march happily over my body.<br> Friends. I haven't got a friend<br> on the force, either, Serpico.<br> - I'll be your friend, Chief.<br> - I'm not lookin' for any.<br> - I'll make an exception for you.<br> - Frank, you're a good cop.<br> Stop being a prima donna.<br> Cut out the shtickklech.<br> I don't understand.<br> How am I being a prima donna?<br> I want to protect myself.<br> We're gonna get the indictments.<br> You're gonna have to testify.<br> Ready on the right.<br> Ready on the left.<br> Ready on the firing line.<br> What are you gonna tell<br> the grand jury, Frankie?<br> Depends on<br> what they ask me.<br> Suppose they ask you<br> who's taking money?<br> What I don't know,<br> I don't know.<br> But you do know, Frank.<br> Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't<br> want to see anything happen to you.<br> But you gotta understand,<br> a lot of people could get hurt here.<br> I'm not saying anything's going to<br> happen. I'm saying it could happen.<br> I mean, there's lots ofways.<br> Nobody has to take a shot at you.<br> They can just not be there<br> when you need them.<br> Somebody come at you with a gun,<br> they look the other way.<br> Or they can send you<br> in first enough times...<br> until finally one day you're gonna<br> walk in the wrong door.<br> - Thanks for the information.<br> - Fuck you, Frank!<br> I have nothing more. Does anyone<br> have any further questions?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Crist?<br> - If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.<br> Officer Serpico came<br> to the 7th Division...<br> more than a year<br> and a half ago.<br> All during that time, the things<br> he's told us were taking place.<br> Now, why didn't<br> Officer Serpico...<br> report these criminal activities<br> when he first encountered them?<br> - I'd like to answer that.<br> - Mr. Chairman...<br> Mrs. Crist's question isn't material<br> or relevant to the present inquiry.<br> - Although I want to make it clear...<br> - I'd like to answer that.<br> Officer Serpico cannot be considered<br> derelict of his duty in any way...<br> or guilty of<br> any infraction of the law.<br> Quite the contrary.<br> The District Attorney is not prepared<br> to say any more at this time.<br> Very well. Officer Serpico,<br> thank you for your testimony.<br> This hearing is adjourned<br> until 10:00 tomorrow morning.<br> Why didn't you tell him<br> about Delaney and Kellogg?<br> Frank, this was a grand jury<br> about police officers...<br> actively engaged in corruption.<br> You don't implicate people<br> without sufficient evidence.<br> That's crap and you know it, because<br> even a dumb cop like me knows...<br> a prosecutor can take a grand jury<br> anywhere it wants to take it.<br> Now, you never led me anywhere<br> near the real problems...<br> Nothing about the bosses,<br> the brass...<br> how corruption like this could exist<br> without anybody knowing about it.<br> Now, a few flunky cops<br> in the Bronx. That's it.<br> None of the shit in Queens,<br> Brooklyn, Manhattan?<br> While you're at it,<br> why don't you mention Kansas City?<br> Well, "the biggest thing since<br> Harry Gross." That's what you said.<br> All right! Look, Frank.<br> You got guts, integrity.<br> There's going to be a detective's<br> gold shield in this for you.<br> Now, that's terrific.<br> That's good.<br> Maybe this is<br> what it's all about.<br> Maybe I should take my<br> gold shield and forget it.<br> I know you've been through<br> an ordeal, Frank.<br> I'm a marked man in this department.<br> For what?<br> - I've already arranged a transfer.<br> - To where? China?<br> That takes a 14-shot clip.<br> You expecting an army?<br> No, just a division.<br> Tauber, did you know I've had<br> reports about Serpico being a fag?<br> He used to hang out<br> in the BCI washroom.<br> That's stupid, Commissioner,<br> and you know it.<br> Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield<br> for Serpico at this time...<br> would convince<br> a lot of people...<br> Not while I'm commissioner.<br> Commander's office?<br> It's down that corridor.<br> Hey, Serpico. Do you know what<br> they're saying in the Bronx?<br> That you spilled your<br> guts to the grand jury.<br> Say it isn't so, Serpico.<br> It isn't so.<br> We know how to handle<br> guys like you.<br> I ought to cut<br> your tongue out.<br> Don't move.<br> Officer Serpico<br> reporting for duty, sir.<br> I'm Inspector Lombardo.<br> I want to shake your hand, Frank.<br> It's gonna be nice to have<br> a guy here I can trust.<br> Anybody in this command<br> you want to work with?<br> It's not who I want to work with.<br> It's who wants to work with me.<br> All right. You can't find anybody<br> you want to work with, Frank...<br> I'll work with you.<br> Is that all right?<br> How do we get past<br> the lookouts?<br> How many you got?<br> One.<br> There's two.<br> - Yeah, there's a guy.<br> - There's three of them.<br> It's four buildings away. We could<br> try to get down the fire escape.<br> Get in behind him.<br> What do you think?<br> - Look good to you?<br> - Yeah, let's go.<br> What do you think?<br> Want to try it?<br> - Oh, boy.<br> - You all right?<br> Yeah. I feel just<br> like a cop again.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Thank you.<br> Close up!<br> Wait, Frank!<br> Come on!<br> I ain't got nothing!<br> Beat it, fuck face!<br> Get the other one! Get out of here!<br> Get up against the wall.<br> What the hell's goin' on here?<br> Who the hell are you?<br> - Who are you?<br> - The police! Who the hell you think?<br> Get the fuck against the wall.<br> Up, up, up!<br> - Let me see your shield.<br> - All right. There's my shield.<br> - Where are you from?<br> - The borough. Manhattan 8th.<br> No, goddamn it! I just paid<br> the borough this morning!<br> What the hell kind of<br> shakedown is this?<br> Who'd you pay<br> in the borough?<br> Nobody.<br> I didn't pay no...<br> Who'd you pay<br> in the borough?<br> I didn't pay nobody.<br> Now let go of me.<br> We followed up,<br> and there's no doubt about it.<br> The pad here in Manhattan<br> is bigger...<br> and it's more sophisticated<br> than the one in the Bronx.<br> The pickups here are made-<br> You want to get this...<br> The pickups are made by...<br> retired policemen.<br> That way, no plainclothesmen<br> are directly involved.<br> Now, we need investigative help<br> on this one, Chief.<br> If you need investigative help<br> and you don't trust your own men...<br> why don't you requisition some<br> recruits from the police academy?<br> With all due respect,<br> sir...<br> backing us up is the only hope<br> the police department has got.<br> Good cops would come forward if they<br> thought there was encouragement...<br> in the department to do so, and if<br> they thought it would do any good.<br> If there's no encouragement,<br> they're not gonna do it.<br> I've done a lot more than most<br> people to defend and preserve...<br> the image of this department<br> and protect Commissioner Delaney...<br> against reckless and irresponsible<br> assaults from outside agencies.<br> That's it, huh?<br> I mean, that's what's<br> really important, isn't it?<br> That's what<br> you want to know...<br> what outside agencies<br> I've been to, right?<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, prick.<br> - Who is this?<br> - Frank.<br> - How are you? Where are you?<br> - I'm ready to go to the Times.<br> It's a goddamn<br> serious step, Frank.<br> I don't know if<br> the timing is right.<br> Look, I want it to get on<br> the record, that's all...<br> in case something<br> should happen to me.<br> I want it on the record.<br> I don't know ifwe<br> carry enough weight.<br> I don't know if the New York Times<br> will go that far out on a limb...<br> on the say-so<br> of two flunky cops.<br> Suppose an inspector<br> were to come with us?<br> You know, I got 20 years<br> on the force.<br> Just bought this place.<br> I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.<br> - Turn that thing off out there!<br> - Come on. Everybody to bed.<br> - Aw, Mom!<br> - Turn that damn thing down!<br> Come on, now.<br> Go on upstairs.<br> You said we could go<br> to bed late!<br> This is against department<br> regulations, you both know that.<br> If they want to throw the book<br> at me, they can do it.<br> If I left the force...<br> I don't know<br> what I could do.<br> Okay, I made my little speech.<br> I'll back you up a hundred percent.<br> Times and the News.<br> I got the money, fellas.<br> Here you go, here you go,<br> here you go.<br> Newsweek, please.<br> Holy sh- Jeez!<br> Aw, Christ!<br> You could almost predict<br> the numbers they're gonna do.<br> Delaney's gonna issue<br> some phony denial.<br> Somebody from the mayor's office<br> will say something noble.<br> Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,<br> the mayor will appoint a commission.<br> "Mayor Lindsay announced the<br> formation of a five-man committee...<br> to review the city procedures for<br> investigating police corruption."<br> How come I'm not<br> in the first paragraph?<br> Unbelievable!<br> The Times' report smells<br> of the familiar smear tactics...<br> of McCarthyism.<br> - I have issued a statement-<br> - We here at city hall...<br> The mayor appointed a special<br> investigation commission...<br> to be headed<br> by Whitman Knapp.<br> Yeah, come.<br> It's your reward. It's a transfer<br> to narcotics, Brooklyn South.<br> You're still in clothes. You get<br> a tin shield, not a gold one.<br> I miss you already, Frank.<br> Look, Frank...<br> it's narcotics.<br> You be careful.<br> It's very easy to get hurt...<br> and to...<br> to be set up.<br> Get in.<br> You're not wired,<br> are you?<br> Okay, you cocksucker.<br> You might get by in the Bronx<br> with that kind of shit...<br> but down here,<br> Last week,<br> one dope dealer...<br> sent out these guys<br> making pickups.<br> We let 'em collect it all,<br> and then hit 'em.<br> That's serious money.<br> And with that,<br> you don't fuck around.<br> - I got the message.<br> - Good.<br> Now get the fuck out.<br> The guy's name is Limbo.<br> He just uses this place,<br> his girlfriend's brother's place.<br> He's a pusher- heroin.<br> - We'll drive around to the corner.<br> - Right.<br> You keep in sight out front. When<br> you spot somebody who's dirty...<br> take off your glasses<br> and wipe 'em.<br> - Got it?<br> - Right. Okay.<br> We stay around here very long,<br> we're gonna get spotted.<br> Well, Frank, why don't you<br> go up there and check it out?<br> - Why don't you?<br> - I got the wrong clothes.<br> I'll take you shopping.<br> Limbo.<br> Police. Freeze!<br> Police officer.<br> All right, up against the wall.<br> Get your hands up against that wall.<br> Get up. All right.<br> - Palms on the wall and spread 'em.<br> - Get those hands up!<br> - Come on. Spread 'em!<br> - Get your feet apart.<br> - I saw the buy.<br> - Let's get Limbo.Julio!<br> - You all right, baby?<br> - Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.<br> Police officer!<br> What the fuck<br> are you waiting for?<br> Go down the fire escape!<br> Police! Throw out your guns<br> and come out with your hands up!<br> - Wait. What do you got here?<br> - It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.<br> Okay. Go ahead.<br> - Where's our son?<br> - They're bringing him from X-ray.<br> - We want to see him.<br> - Just a few minutes.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...<br> the news is better<br> than we expected.<br> Thank God the bullet<br> was a small caliber.<br> It didn't enter the brain...<br> or strike the spinal cord.<br> He's on the critical list...<br> but his condition<br> seems to be stable.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> Thank you.<br> Stay out of there.<br> Didn't they tell you?<br> What?<br> The word is, don't talk to him.<br> He's no fuckin' good.<br> - How you doing, kid?<br> - Hello, Sid.<br> How are you?<br> You wanna read my fan mail?<br> Sure.<br> You're a big shot now, huh?<br> I want you to get those<br> fucking cops away from my door.<br> The Knapp Commission likes you.<br> They want you to appear.<br> Naturally.<br> Heinemann and Julio<br> are cleared.<br> The three of you are up for<br> exceptional merit awards.<br> That's very funny.<br> That's very funny.<br> Francesco, you love me?<br> I always had a thing for you, Sid.<br> You know that.<br> Your gold shield's<br> come through.<br> What's this for?<br> For being an honest cop?<br> Or for being stupid enough<br> to get shot in the face?<br> You tell them<br> they can shove it.<br> I don't want it.<br> Oh, well.<br> Well, Frank,<br> the facts are these.<br> You'll have to stay on leave<br> of absence for a few months.<br> In all probability, the hearing<br> in your left ear won't come back.<br> Two bullet fragments are still<br> lodged there in the bony portion.<br> One is very close to<br> the carotid artery...<br> andyou'll have to be checkked<br> from time to time.<br> Your left side will<br> feel stiffioccasionally.<br> Once in a great while you may<br> experience some dizziness.<br> But in general,<br> you'll be okkay.<br> Through my appearance<br> here today...<br> I hope that police officers in<br> the future will not experience...<br> the same frustration and anxiety<br> that I was subjected to...<br> for the past five years<br> at the hands of my superiors...<br> because of my attempt<br> to report corruption.<br> I was made to feel that I had<br> burdened them with an unwanted task.<br> The problem is that the atmosphere<br> does not yet exist...<br> in which an honest police officer<br> can act...<br> without fear of ridicule<br> or reprisal from fellow officers.<br> Police corruption cannot exist<br> unless it is at least tolerated...<br> at higher levels<br> in the department.<br> Therefore, the most important result<br> that can come from these hearings...<br> is a conviction by police officers<br> that the department will change.<br> In order to ensure this...<br> an independent,<br> permanent investigative body...<br> dealing with police corruption,<br> like this commission, is essential.<br>
