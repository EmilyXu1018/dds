Frank's just touchy<br> about his name, that's all.<br> There was no "F" names in the bible.<br> So Maw named him Frankincense.<br> Because<br> he smelled so sweet.<br> Now, look... Like I was saying,<br> up there's the bedroom.<br> Down there's where<br> the boys bunk.<br> You follow me,<br> I'll show you the rest.<br> Uh, this is<br> the washroom.<br> Me and the boys<br> are kinda hard on clothes.<br> So there'll be a lot of washing<br> and mending. But now that...<br> that I'm here.<br> This<br> is the kitchen.<br> You'll find flour<br> in that barrel right there.<br> Salt pork<br> over there.<br> Get out of here,<br> all of you!<br> How do you expect her<br> to get supper with you underfoot?<br> Come on, all of you,<br> get out of here.<br> You, too, Gideon.<br> Come on.<br> You'll find wood<br> down the path, and...<br> water's right outside<br> the front door.<br> There's the dinner bell.<br> So... ring it loud when you<br> get supper ready.<br> [Clanging]<br> Ow!<br> What'd you do<br> that for?<br> You... all of you falling<br> on the food that way!<br> Haven't you any decency<br> to wait for grace?<br> Huh?

Nah, it's<br> more than that.<br> It's something<br> that goes a lot deeper.<br> Suppose you get sick.<br> Or break a leg or something.<br> Up there all alone?<br> And the wolves are mighty<br> bad this year.<br> The wolves will seem like<br> good company after what I've<br> just been through.<br> [Crying]<br> There's nothing like<br> a nice hot cup of tea<br> When you're<br> all tuckered out.<br> Milly. Milly, it's me, Gideon.<br> I got to speak to you.<br> No, Milly! Don't!<br> - What is it?<br> - It's about Adam.<br> He's going away<br> up to the mountains,<br> up to the trapping cabin.<br> Milly,<br> can you hear me?<br> I hear.<br> You just speak to him.<br> Ask him not to go.<br> Please, Milly.<br> He's gotta learn that he can't<br> treat people this way.<br> Now, Eph, let's<br> start here.<br> Oh!<br> Oh!
