                        Somebody's coming, Pa.<br> Well... Let him come.<br> Hope you don't mind<br> my cutting through your place.<br> - No, I guess not.<br> - I'm heading north.<br> Didn't expect to find<br> any fences around here.<br> Hello, boy.<br> - You were watching me, weren't you?<br> - Yes, I was.<br> I like a man who watches<br> things goin' around.<br> It means he'll make his mark some day.<br> Long time since I've seen a Jersey cow.<br> You'll see a lot more.<br> Jerseys and Holsteins...<br> ...and the like.<br> - Can I offer you some water?<br> - Thanks.<br> You're a little touchy.<br> Joey!<br> - You know not to point guns at people.<br> - I wasn't pointing at anybody, Mother.<br> Sure had me snortin', son.<br> I just wanted you to see my rifle.<br> Bet you can shoot.<br> - Can't you?<br> - Little bit.<br> Looks like your friends are a little late.<br> What are the Ryker boys up to this time?<br> - Rykers?<br> - That's what I said.<br> I wouldn't know a Ryker<br> from your Jersey cow.<br> Don't forget to close the gate<br> on your way out.<br> Would you put down that gun?<br> Then I'll leave.<br> What's the difference?<br> You're leaving anyway.<br> I'd like it to be my idea.<br> Howdy, Starrett.<br> Expectin' trouble?<br> I don't want no trouble, Starrett.<br> I came to inform you.<br> I got that reservation beef contract.<br> - So many to tell me that?<br> - I mean business.<br> - Then, tend to your own.<br> - That's just what I'm doin'.<br> I'm gonna need all my range.<br> Now you've warned me,<br> get off my place.<br> Your place?<br> You'll have to get out before the snow.<br> - Supposin' I don't?<br> - You and the other squatters.<br> - Homesteaders, you mean.<br> - I could blast you outta here right now.<br> Listen to me. The time for gun-blastin'<br> a man off his place is passed.<br> - They're building a penitentiary...<br> - Joe, that's enough.<br> Who are you, stranger?<br> I'm a friend of Starrett's.<br> Well, Starrett, you can't say<br> I didn't warn you.<br> All right, you've told me.<br> Now get off my claim.<br> Supper'll be ready in a little while, Joe.<br> Won't be very long.<br> Wait, mister, I...<br> I swear, I... Wait a minute, please.<br> I take that back, what I...<br> Look, this... this thing ain't even loaded.<br> - Not loaded?<br> - No, Joey's too young to go loaded.<br> That's his gun.<br> If this don't beat all!<br> My name is Starrett, Joe Starrett,<br> and this here's Joey.<br> You heard what my little woman said.<br> Come on in, I feel like eatin'.<br> - You can call me Shane.<br> - Guess I spook kinda easy these days.<br> Hello, Joe.<br> My place ain't very much yet,<br> but my wife sure can cook!<br> It won't be long till supper.<br> You can wash up right here.<br> In case you wanted to know,<br> that's Ryker's spread all over there.<br> He thinks the whole world<br> belongs to him.<br> The old-timers can't see it yet,<br> but runnin' cattle<br> on an open range can't go on.<br> It takes too much space<br> for too little results.<br> Those herds aren't any good,<br> they're all horns and bone.<br> Cattle that is bred for meat and fenced in<br> and fed right, that's the thing.<br> You gotta pick your spot,<br> get your land, your own land.<br> A homesteader can't run but a few beef,<br> but he can grow grain,<br> and then with his garden<br> and hogs and milk, he'll be all right.<br> We make out, don't we, Marian?<br> Of course.<br> It's that calf again.<br> Joey, chase her out of there.<br> Joey! Run on, son.<br> Don't forget to shut that gate.<br> Joey!<br> Come on, shoo!<br> I wouldn't ask you where you're bound.<br> One place or another.<br> Some place I've never been.<br> - The only way I'll leave is in a pine box.<br> - What do you mean, Pa?<br> I mean they'll have to shoot me<br> and carry me out.<br> - You shouldn't talk like that.<br> - It's the truth.<br> You love this place.<br> We've got our roots down.<br> - I wish you wouldn't talk that way.<br> - Our first real home.<br> - What did you mean...?<br> - Joey, be quiet. The men want to talk.<br> There's just more work here<br> than I can do.<br> If I could hire me a man that...<br> I had one once,<br> but the Rykers roughed him up,<br> so he lit out, cussin' me...<br> They knocked his teeth out.<br> Ready for pie?<br> If nobody else is gonna eat this biscuit,<br> I guess I'll have to.<br> - We're kind of fancy, aren't we?<br> - What is, Pa?<br> Good plates, an extra fork...<br> What about me, Ma?<br> - What's the matter, Marian?<br> - Nothing.<br> That was an elegant dinner, Mrs Starrett.<br> Excuse me.<br> Where's Mr Shane going?<br> He didn't even say goodbye.<br> He's not going, Joey.<br> He wouldn't go without taking that.<br> I'm going outside with him.<br> - Did you ask him to stay the night?<br> - I'll do that right now.<br> Well, I'll be doggone.<br> Come here a minute.<br> Joe, why don't you hitch up the team?<br> Marian, I've been fighting this stump<br> off and on for two years.<br> Use the team now,<br> this stump could say it beat us.<br> Sometimes nothing will do<br> but your own sweat and muscle.<br> All right.<br> Bang! Bang!<br> I wish they'd give me<br> some bullets for this gun.<br> - Good morning, Joey.<br> - How did you know it was me?<br> Well, I figured the cow<br> couldn't work that latch.<br> - Why are you up so early?<br> - You're to stay for breakfast.<br> Oh... Well, thank you.<br> - Then where will you go?<br> - Where would you say, Joey?<br> I wish you'd stay here.<br> - Would you teach me to shoot?<br> - You'd like to learn to shoot?<br> Pa wishes you'd stay, too.<br> I heard him tell Mother.<br> He said he didn't want you<br> to fight his fights for him,<br> just help with the work.<br> I bet you wouldn't leave<br> just because it's dangerous.<br> Joey!<br> Joey, come here this minute.<br> I hope you'll stay, Mr Shane.<br> Coming, Mother!<br> Close the gate, Joey.<br> What are you doing in your nightshirt?<br> Come in and put your clothes on.<br> Would you like to hitch up the team<br> and haul that wire from Grafton's?<br> - Anything you say.<br> - Get off the bed. Go on!<br> He's holding it for me at the store.<br> While you're there, you might as well<br> get yourself some work clothes.<br> - What can I bring Joey?<br> - Soda-pop!<br> You don't need anything, Joey.<br> Be careful. I don't want my troubles<br> to be none of yours.<br> Aren't you wearing your six-shooter?<br> I didn't know there was<br> any wild game in town, Joey.<br> Come on, son.<br> Joey, come back here!<br> Bang!<br> Bang!<br> - Who are you shootin' at?<br> - Rykers. Bang!<br> - Did you get many?<br> - Missed one.<br> Well, can't stand for that.<br> Pa, do you guess<br> Shane will teach me to shoot?<br> I'll teach you myself<br> once I get the time, Joey.<br> - Can you shoot as good as Shane?<br> - I've never seen him shoot.<br> But I doubt it.<br> He didn't wear his gun today.<br> Why's that, Pa?<br> Well, he's tradin' at the store,<br> not holdin' it up.<br> But why, Pa? Honest, why didn't he?<br> - I don't wear one myself.<br> - It goes with him, though.<br> - Somebody's coming, Joe.<br> - I know. It's Ernie Wright.<br> Could you whip him, Pa?<br> Could you whip Shane?<br> - Can't you ask nothing but questions?<br> - But could you?<br> Oh, maybe.<br> No call for that though, Joey.<br> Shane's on our side.<br> Howdy, Joe.<br> How are you, Ernie?<br> - No good.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I'm pulling stakes.<br> No use of your talking.<br> - Now what's the matter?<br> - My wheat. Them Rykers raided it.<br> Fence cut, steers drove in.<br> It's just stubs now.<br> - When?<br> - Last night.<br> I'm leaving, and don't try<br> to talk me out of it.<br> - You can't...<br> - Just don't try, that's all.<br> - I listened to you too much already.<br> - Go ahead, nobody's holding you.<br> You wouldn't leave<br> your home and land, and...<br> Oh, Ernie, you...<br> I'm wore down and out. Tired of being<br> insulted by them fellas.<br> Called a pig-farmer.<br> Who knows what comes next?<br> Well, don't throw your tail up.<br> Tell you what, we'll all get together here<br> tonight and figure out something.<br> I don't know about me.<br> I'll get the word around.<br> You tell Shipstead and Torrey.<br> All right,<br> but if we're having a meeting,<br> it'd better be more than pokin' holes<br> in the air with your finger.<br> - Anything I can do you for?<br> - I came to get wire for Joe Starrett.<br> I've been holding wire<br> for Starrett for quite a spell.<br> - Are you new?<br> - Yes, I'm working for Starrett.<br> - Got ready-made pants to fit me?<br> - Farm rig?<br> I outfit all these farmers.<br> - Step right in back and try 'em on.<br> - Thanks.<br> Will.<br> Hey, Will.<br> You're thirsty, ain't you, Chris?<br> - Will! Who's tendin' bar round here?<br> - Comin' right in.<br> - How is it?<br> - Good enough.<br> - How much do I owe you?<br> - Now, let's see...<br> Pants, a dollar. Two shirts, 60 cents.<br> Belt...<br> Young man, you owe me<br> two dollars and two bits.<br> What's the matter, son?<br> You look kinda pale.<br> Been a long time since<br> I got store-bought clothes.<br> Money don't go very far these days.<br> A new sodbuster?<br> Thought I smelled pigs.<br> - Anything else?<br> - Got any soda-pop?<br> I sure do. I wish more men<br> around here would drink it.<br> - In my bar, in there.<br> - Thanks.<br> Will! Let's keep the smell of pigs<br> out from where we're drinking.<br> - Bartender.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> Do you have any soda-pop?<br> Are you gonna get him out<br> or do I have to?<br> Let me take him, Chris.<br> What'll it be?<br> Lemon, strawberry or lilac, sodbuster?<br> You speaking to me?<br> I don't see<br> nobody else standing there.<br> Here, have some of this.<br> Smell like a man.<br> Don't it smell better in here, Grafton?<br> Chris just fumigated a sodbuster.<br> Just take it easy.<br> I was just asking about sody-pop,<br> pigs and taters<br> and one thing and another.<br> Which one of them tater-pickers<br> are you working for?<br> Or are you just<br> squatting on the range?<br> Joe Starrett, if it's any of your business.<br> Supposing I make it my business?<br> Here's your soda-pop, mister.<br> Now you and your soda-pop<br> get outta here and stay outta here.<br> And don't come back!<br> Did you see that, Rufe?<br> Chris just put the run on a sodbuster.<br> That's it. Keep 'em on the move.<br> Warm it up for you?<br> It's getting so I don't like<br> to ride at night.<br> Let's hope the meeting starts...<br> - Is Shane going to be at the meeting?<br> - Mr Shane. Yes, I suppose so.<br> We all know why we're here.<br> Ryker's war-party's<br> been around to see all of us.<br> I'm here to tell you,<br> I ain't leavin' now or any other time.<br> Start with you, Axel. What do you say?<br> Well, Joe, you see...<br> I know what I want to say.<br> Start with me.<br> Ernie, we're gonna hear<br> everybody in turn. Go ahead.<br> Most of you don't know Shane.<br> - Shane, this is Yank Potts.<br> - Howdy.<br> - Fred Lewis here.<br> - I seen you in town.<br> Ernie Wright here, and Ed Howells.<br> - And Johnson.<br> - Howdy, Shane.<br> - See anybody else coming?<br> - No.<br> - We're waiting for Torrey.<br> - How far is Ryker gonna push us?<br> Let's not talk scared,<br> that's what Ryker wants.<br> He thinks he can shoo us off<br> like a flock of chickens.<br> Here's Torrey.<br> - Hello, Reb.<br> - Hello, Yank.<br> About time you showed up.<br> That's enough out of you, Yank.<br> - And you, too.<br> - All right. Cool off, Stonewall.<br> Shake hands with Shane, there.<br> Shane's working for me.<br> Shane. Oh, yeah...<br> I heard about you, at Grafton's.<br> Go on, Joe.<br> Well, Stonewall, it's like this...<br> Leaving Ernie out, maybe,<br> we've all agreed we're gonna stick.<br> Now you're whistling.<br> Ain't nobody pushing me off my claim.<br> - I think you all know that I'm staying.<br> - I, too, will stay.<br> I'll string along,<br> leastways till the shooting starts.<br> There ain't but seven of us,<br> if it comes to a fight.<br> - Him.<br> - That's eight.<br> - Can't count on him.<br> - He's proved that much.<br> Watch what you're saying.<br> Shane can tell you what happened<br> with Ryker's man, Chris.<br> They're talking about Shane!<br> What is this, Shane?<br> Let him say.<br> - Lewis seen and heard it.<br> - He let Chris buffalo him at Grafton's.<br> Fred, I told Shane<br> to stay away from trouble.<br> - Let's finish the story.<br> - He didn't. Shane didn't let him do that!<br> This Chris went around bragging<br> he put the run on a sodbuster.<br> Shane, you don't have to leave.<br> I figured you could talk freer<br> if I weren't around.<br> It's too late to finish this now.<br> - He didn't, did he?<br> - Joey, I want you to go to sleep.<br> - It's all right, everything's all right.<br> - Shane isn't going away?<br> No, he isn't.

Nobody messes up<br> my boys and gets away with it.<br> We'll ride you out of this valley.<br> Gonna rough you up and ride you out<br> and you're gonna stay out.<br> - Shane, come on!<br> - Joey, get out of here.<br> But, Shane, there's too many.<br> You wouldn't want me to run away,<br> would you?<br> But there's too many, Shane.<br> Go on, son, please.<br> - Stop!<br> - I'll pay the damages.<br> - No more fighting.<br> - Keep outta this.<br> - This man's unarmed.<br> - It ain't a shooting.<br> Quit butting in.<br> I'll take him.<br> Stop it, men!

You fools have had enough of it.<br> You'll all get killed.<br> Starrett, you and Shane<br> back on out of here.<br> That's making some sense, Starrett.<br> You've won.<br> - Get out of here.<br> - Ryker ain't paying for this damage.<br> I'm paying for what's broke.<br> No, by Godfrey, we're paying<br> for what's broke, me and Shane!<br> Morgan, put one of the boys<br> on a good horse.<br> He's got a long trip,<br> all the way to Cheyenne.<br> I'm through fooling, Grafton.<br> From now on, when we fight with them,<br> the air's gonna be full of gunsmoke.<br> - I saw it all, Mother, every bit.<br> - It's no place for you, Joey.<br> No place for you either, Marian.<br> I was scared. Then Pa picked up<br> that man and slung him on the floor.<br> I didn't do much. It was all Shane.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - Better.<br> You did, Joe.<br> It was ugly and you were both wonderful.<br> When that chair came down on you,<br> Shane, I thought you were a goner.<br> It was an easy chair, Joey.<br> I bet you two could lick anyone.<br> Well, one thing's for sure,<br> Ryker's gonna think twice.<br> - Don't talk about Ryker any more now.<br> - I wish we could forget him.<br> - This turpentine'll hurt.<br> - He wouldn't say nothing.<br> No matter how much it hurt.<br> Would you, Shane?<br> I'm afraid I would, Joey,<br> if it hurt bad enough.<br> - It stings like anything.<br> - Joey, go on to bed.<br> It does smart, I know.<br> - Ouch!<br> - Gosh!<br> - Joey, for the last time, go to bed.<br> - Yeah, me, too.<br> Come on, son.<br> - Will you kiss me goodnight, Mother?<br> - All right.<br> Your head...<br> Your head needs a bandage.<br> It's good enough, Marian, it's fine.<br> Thanks very much.<br> - You wanna know something, Mother?<br> - What is it?<br> - What is it, Joey?<br> - Mother...<br> - I just love Shane.<br> - Do you?<br> I love him almost as much as I love Pa.<br> That's all right, isn't it?<br> - He's a fine man.<br> - He's so good.<br> Don't you like him, Mother?<br> Yes, I like him, too, Joey.<br> Goodnight, Joey.<br> What's the matter, honey?<br> Joe...<br> Hold me.<br> Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.<br> - 'Night, Ma!<br> - Goodnight, Joey.<br> - 'Night, Pa!<br> - 'Night, son.<br> 'Night, Shane!<br> Where's Ryker?<br> He's getting a little sleep.<br> - He sent for me.<br> - Sit down for a minute.<br> We're having a celebration today.<br> - Where's the coffee?<br> - I'll put it right on.<br> - What's going on here?<br> - Plenty.<br> - Going somewhere?<br> - Looks that way, don't it?<br> Don't let 'em bluff you, Ernie.<br> Bluff, huh?<br> See that?<br> They killed my sow last night.<br> Kept shooting<br> and yelling what they'd do next.<br> Woke up the kids and<br> scared the missus half to death.<br> - We're gonna put a stop to that.<br> - I said I'd stay for one more hand.<br> Well, this is it. I had enough of Ryker.<br> Here they come again!<br> Right through my ploughed ground.<br> What do you think of that,<br> Stonewall Torrey?<br> Starrett and the rest of us<br> are gonna take the juice out of 'em,<br> one of these days.<br> Anyhow, I'm going to Grafton's<br> to get a bottle.<br> - Show 'em it's Independence Day.<br> - Ma, you getting ready?<br> - Good luck.<br> - Good luck for you, too, Stonewall.<br> Can't see a pig in sight!<br> I don't see none,<br> but I sure can smell 'em.<br> They cut Mr Wright's fence<br> and Mr Shipstead's, too.<br> They did?<br> Shane, what would you do<br> if you caught them cutting our fence?<br> I'd ask them<br> to please go around by the gate.<br> Oh, Shane!<br> - Come on, I'll race you to the barn.<br> - It's a go!<br> Why don't you ever wear<br> your six-shooter, Shane?<br> I guess I don't see<br> as many bad men as you do.<br> Shane.<br> - You want me to tell you something?<br> - If you want to.<br> I saw your gun in there, one day.<br> - I took a look at it.<br> - Oh?<br> - Are you mad?<br> - No, I guess not.<br> But if I were you,<br> I'd leave a thing like this alone.<br> - I wrapped it up in the blanket again.<br> - That's a good boy.<br> Could I see it again?<br> You promised you'd show me<br> how to shoot.<br> Please!<br> All right, Joey. Come on.<br> Get 'em up!<br> We've got some learning to do!<br> Come on.<br> You stand right here.<br> All right, put your arms<br> down to your side.<br> Your holster's too low.<br> Never have your holster at arm's length.<br> Let's fix this.<br> You always have it here, with the grip<br> between the elbow and the wrist.<br> So when your hand comes up,<br> the gun clears the holster<br> without coming up too high, see?<br> Now you try it, real fast and straight.<br> That's it.<br> - Gosh! Is that what real gunfighters do?<br> - No, Joey.<br> Most of them have tricks of their own.<br> One, for instance,<br> likes a shoulder holster.<br> Another one puts it<br> in the belt of his pants.<br> And some like two guns.<br> But one's all you need if you can use it...<br> ...after 15 paces. No good for putting<br> a bullet where you want it.<br> Which is the best way?<br> What I'm telling you is as good as any,<br> better than most.<br> - Let me see you shoot.<br> - What do you want me to shoot at?<br> The little white rock over there, see?<br> Gosh, almighty, that is good!<br> You see, Joey?<br> Now look. Remember.<br> When your hand comes up,<br> you still clear your holster.<br> - Shane.<br> - Hello, Mrs Starrett.<br> - I was teaching Joey a little shooting.<br> - I don't want...<br> You ought to see Shane shoot.<br> He's teaching me.<br> - Yes, I know. Get ready for the party.<br> - Oh, Ma!<br> Guns aren't going to be my boy's life.<br> Why do you always<br> have to spoil everything?<br> A gun is a tool,<br> no better or worse than any other tool,<br> an axe, a shovel, or anything.<br> A gun is as good or as bad<br> as the man using it. Remember that.<br> We'd all be better off<br> if there wasn't a single gun in this valley,<br> including yours.<br> What's all the shooting about?<br> You're starting the celebrating<br> a little early, aren't you?<br> Well, look at that woman,<br> in her wedding dress!<br> Shane, you better hitch up that team,<br> 'cause today we're really gonna<br> celebrate the Fourth of July!<br> I'm supposed to say to the squatters,<br> "I'm busted but you're welcome."<br> - It ain't that bad.<br> - That's easy for you to say.<br> I've been your friend a long time,<br> I'm reasonable.<br> - But something's got to give.<br> - Out here a man can go just so far.<br> I've gone along with the new law.<br> I've stayed away from gunfighting.<br> Sure, I've tried to buffalo the sodbusters.<br> You got to admit,<br> my men have kept their six-guns cased.<br> And now?<br> - I can guess what's on your mind.<br> - Keep your guesses to yourself.<br> - I like Joe Starrett.<br> - Fool oughta listen to reason.<br> - Your reason?<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> No offence, Rufe.<br> It's your own conscience eating on you.<br> Conscience!<br> Hello, Torrey.<br> Something I can do you for?<br> - A jug. It's the Fourth.<br> - Come in, come in.<br> Jug. And a whiskey.<br> Here's to you, Ryker,<br> for running Ernie Wright off his claim.<br> Another.<br> - Is that one of them?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's a downright dirty shame.<br> It's all he had and he worked hard for it.<br> I want to tell you something, Ryker.<br> He's running because he's a coward.<br> And here's to me, 'cause I ain't a coward<br> and you ain't getting my claim.<br> They're hot-headed.<br> You'd get him to draw<br> without any trouble.<br> It'd be easy.<br> You can't scare me<br> any more than you can Joe Starrett.<br> No. It's Starrett we want.<br> - Three cheers for Wyoming!<br> - The rest of you care to join me?<br> Drink a toast to the greatest state<br> in the Union?<br> I'm from Wyoming.<br> Here's to the independence<br> of the sovereign state of Alabama.<br> There you are.<br> I'm through with all you Yanks.<br> Listen, you Yankees...!<br> Hello, Axel.<br> You're late, Reb,<br> we took Richmond two hours ago!<br> - Everybody, come here...<br> - Marian!<br> You come too,<br> I have something important to tell you.<br> - Axel...<br> - Ja, Mama. Now...<br> You all know what today is.<br> It's Independence Day.<br> Except for one man here. Yes, sir.<br> This was the day Joe Starrett<br> got himself hooked, by golly!<br> Well, no...<br> - What I'd like to say is...<br> - Well, say it, Joe!<br> - I'd like to say that Axel's right.<br> - What did he say, Joe?<br> I gave up my independence<br> But no man ever gave it up<br> as easy as I did.<br> And what's more, I wouldn't trade<br> places with any man in this world.<br> - Good speech!<br> - Go on, Joe, give her a kiss.<br> Come here!<br> Congratulations.<br> Pass the word to the boys,<br> I got some cheer for us.<br> Many more, Joe!<br> We were ready to give you up,<br> you and Ernie.<br> Ernie's getting out today.<br> Packed up kit and caboodle.<br> - Been expecting that.<br> - Ryker's boys bluffed him out.<br> - Maybe he had sense.<br> - What were you doing in town?<br> - Joe, I want to dance.<br> - Marian, they've fenced me out here.<br> - Joe don't want you in town by yourself.<br> - It's just Ryker and Grafton gabbing.<br> Grafton's OK.<br> Another man was there,<br> likely hired by Ryker.<br> - Who was that?<br> - Stranger, decked out like a gunfighter.<br> - Did you say "guns"?<br> - Yeah, two guns.<br> - What did he look like?<br> - Packs two guns, kinda lean...<br> He wears a black hat.<br> - Is he a friend of yours?<br> - No.<br> A man named Wilson looks like that,<br> a gunfighter.<br> - Jack Wilson?<br> - Gunfighter outta Cheyenne.<br> - Can't be him, can it?<br> - I didn't ask him his name.<br> - What about him?<br> - What's a gunman doing around here?<br> - Pow-wow with Ryker?<br> - Don't start. We don't know it's Wilson.<br> This Wilson, would you know him,<br> Shane? If you saw him?<br> Maybe. If it is Wilson,<br> he's fast on the draw, so be careful.<br> You seem to know a lot about<br> this kind of business, Shane.<br> That is enough. Come and eat<br> before things get cold.<br> I don't want no part of gunslinging.<br> Murder's a better name.<br> We eat now, everyone.<br> You fellas get the shoe game!<br> Torrey, I want to go to the blacksmith's,<br> but Joe says we shouldn't go alone.<br> Any time you wanna go to town,<br> I'll ride along with you.<br> I'm a soldier who's done fighting<br> in real battles.<br> I can shoot just as straight...<br> Shane...<br> - Yes, Joey?<br> - Think that was him?<br> - Who?<br> - That man Torrey seen in town.<br> Do you think that was Wilson?<br> - Don't worry about things like that.<br> - Rest, Joey. It's past your bedtime.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> - No, Joey. I'll open it.<br> - All right.<br> All right. I'll open the gate for you.<br> Who goes there?<br> Brother Rufe's come<br> to pay you a little visit.<br> Howdy, Starrett.<br> Evening, ma'am.<br> I had somethin' I wanted<br> to talk over with you.<br> Whatever business we got,<br> we can talk over right here.<br> I'll just lay it on the barrelhead, then.<br> How'd you like to work for me?<br> I work for myself.<br> Done enough working for others.<br> Wait till I tell you.<br> I'll pay you top wages. More than<br> you make on this patch of ground.<br> No, I'm not interested.<br> I haven't said it all.<br> You can run your cattle with mine.<br> What's more, I'll buy your homestead.<br> Set a price you think is reasonable,<br> you'll find me reasonable.<br> Is that fair?<br> You've made things hard for us,<br> and we're in the right.<br> Right? You in the right?<br> When I came to this country,<br> you weren't much older than your boy.<br> We had rough times. Me and other men<br> that are mostly dead now.<br> I got a bad shoulder yet<br> from a Cheyenne arrowhead.<br> We made this country,<br> we found it and we made it,<br> with blood and empty bellies.<br> Cattle we brought in were hazed off<br> by Indians and rustlers.<br> They don't bother you much any more<br> because we handled 'em.<br> We made a safe range out of this.<br> Some of us died doing it,<br> but we made it.<br> Then people move in who never<br> had to raw-hide it through the old days.<br> They fence off my range<br> and fence me off from water.<br> Some of them plough ditches,<br> take out irrigation water.<br> So the creek runs dry sometimes<br> and I gotta move my stock because of it.<br> And you say we have no right<br> to the range.<br> The men that did the work<br> and ran the risks have no rights?<br> I take you for a fair man, Starrett.<br> I'm not belittling what you did,<br> but you didn't find this country.<br> There were trappers here<br> and Indian traders before you.<br> - They tamed this country.<br> - They weren't ranchers.<br> Rights! You think you've the right<br> to say nobody else has got any.<br> That ain't the way<br> the Government looks at it.<br> I didn't come to argue.<br> I made you a fair proposition.<br> What about the others?<br> - Shane knows he can work for me.<br> - The other homesteaders?<br> Look, be reasonable!<br> After all, there's just so many hands<br> in a deck of cards.<br> - Then, I've got to say no.<br> - You don't give a man much choice.<br> How do you feel about it, son?<br> Would you like to go partners with me?<br> I don't want trouble with your father.<br> We don't want anyone to get hurt.<br> - Joey ain't quite of age, Ryker.<br> - How about it, son?<br> Come here, Joey.<br> I don't want you to be sorry, Starrett.<br> I'll see you.<br> What do you make of him?<br> He's no cow-puncher.<br> No. He doesn't look the part.<br> I like Starrett, too,<br> but I'll kill him if I have to.<br> - I'll kill him if I have to.<br> - You mean I'll kill him if you have to.<br> I can't have any run-in with the law.<br> You heard Grafton.<br> Just get Starrett in here.<br> It wouldn't take much to bait him.<br> Well, look here.<br> Look here.<br> Why don't we just gun him<br> and get on with it?<br> One's run already.<br> It won't take much to stampede the rest.<br> Remember, Wilson, you got<br> to make this look right to Grafton.<br> Hey, come here!<br> Torrey... I wouldn't go over there, Torrey.<br> Nobody's gonna buffalo me.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - To get a whiskey.<br> - Torrey.<br> Torrey.<br> Torrey.<br> They tell me they call you "Stonewall".<br> - Anything wrong with that?<br> - It's just funny.<br> I guess they named a lot of that...<br> ...Southern trash after old Stonewall.<br> Who'd they name you after?<br> Or would you know?<br> I'm saying that "Stonewall" Jackson<br> was trash himself.<br> Him and Lee,<br> and all the rest of them Rebs.<br> You, too.<br> - You're a low-down, lying Yankee.<br> - Prove it.<br> No, Torrey!<br> One less sodbuster.<br> - What?<br> - He tried to pull on Wilson.<br> - Ain't that right, Swede?<br> - He tried to reach for a...<br> All right. Get him outta here.<br> Tell your friends<br> we'll be waiting for any more<br> that come in looking for trouble.<br> You understand that, Swede?<br> Now get him outta here.<br> - What happened?<br> - The sodbuster tried to kill Wilson.<br> - What's the shooting?<br> - Sodbuster tried to pull on Wilson.<br> Lewis!<br> - Lewis!<br> - Pa! What's happened?<br> - Lewis!<br> - Fred!<br> Fred!<br> Torrey, he is dead!<br> Ryker did it!<br> I'll go get Starrett.<br> Shane, we sure enough<br> earned our keep today.<br> If they just leave us alone,<br> we'll make a farm out of this yet.<br> Somebody's coming, Pa.<br> - Looks like Shipstead.<br> - It's Mr Shipstead.<br> Starrett!<br> Torrey, he is dead!<br> Torrey?<br> Torrey, he is dead!<br> The new man shot him,<br> the new man that works for Ryker did it.<br> I was across the street,<br> I heard anger in the voices.<br> The two of them reach for pistols,<br> but the new man is quick, terribly quick.<br> One shot, Torrey dead.<br> - One shot.<br> - What happened?<br> We go to town together.<br> He say it be safe.<br> It was all quiet. We separate.<br> Then the anger in the voices, I hear.<br> Only the anger, not the words.<br> Ryker's men were all around.<br> What started it?<br> I passed Lewis, his missus and Johnson.<br> They're scared.<br> - Who saw it?<br> - Just the Ryker men and me.<br> Morgan say they wait for any more<br> who come looking for trouble.<br> Marian, you get ready.<br> Mrs Torrey will need you.<br> Shane, hitch up the team.<br> What are you going to do, Joe?<br> - Go to town. I'm gonna see about this.<br> - You can't go alone.<br> - Marian, I'm going.<br> - She's right, Joe.<br> But the others are all in this,<br> it's not just you. Wait for them.<br> - Sooner or later, someone's got to go.<br> - But not now. Don't you go alone!<br> The other homesteaders, I think<br> they run. I think they get out of here.<br> Here comes Joe Starrett.<br> Wish he'd tend to his own business.<br> - What goes on?<br> - We're going on. I've had enough.<br> I sure figured you for a better man.<br> You saw what's happened.<br> Torrey's dead.<br> Just gonna pile up your plunder and skip.<br> Too scared to see Torrey<br> get a decent funeral.<br> I don't want him killed. We're going.<br> It ain't a question<br> of who stays or who runs.<br> We gotta see Stonewall<br> get a Christian burial,<br> and his wife hear some words of comfort<br> said over her man.<br> We'll make sure it's done.<br> Torrey's already dead.<br> I don't want it to happen to my man.<br> Fred, if you ain't at that funeral,<br> I'll sure take it bad of you.<br> Well... cemetery hill's<br> on the way out, Martha...<br> Shipstead, would you please<br> lead us in the Lord's Prayer?<br> Our Father who art in heaven,<br> hallowed be Thy name.<br> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done<br> on earth, as it is in heaven.<br> Give us this day our daily bread,<br> and forgive us our trespasses as we<br> forgive those who trespass against us.<br> And lead us not into temptation,<br> but deliver us from evil.<br> For Thine is the kingdom,<br> and the power,<br> and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br> He's gonna bite you!<br> Goodbye, Mrs Starrett, we're going.<br> Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye, Axel.<br> Goodbye, John.<br> Sue, you put the kids in the wagon.<br> Wait for me, Lewis.<br> I'm coming with you.<br> Wait a minute, let's not be in a hurry.<br> There's one more thing.<br> Torrey was a pretty brave man.<br> We'd be doing wrong<br> if we wasn't the same.<br> Last time you argued that,<br> Torrey was alive.<br> - You want us to stay for more of this?<br> - We can have a regular settlement.<br> We can have a town,<br> and churches and a school...<br> Graveyards...<br> You've just got to, that's all.<br> He wants you to stay for something<br> that means more than anything.<br> Your families.<br> Your wives and kids.<br> Like you, Lewis, your girls...<br> ...and Shipstead with his boys.<br> They've got a right to stay here<br> and grow up and be happy.<br> It's up to you people<br> to have nerve enough to not give it up.<br> That's right. We can't give up this valley<br> and we ain't gonna do it.<br> This is farming country, a place<br> for people to bring up their families.<br> Who's Ryker to run us<br> away from our own homes?<br> He only wants to grow beef,<br> and we want to grow families,<br> to grow them good and strong,<br> the way they were meant to be grown.<br> God didn't make all this country<br> just for one man like Ryker.<br> He's got it though,<br> and that's what counts.<br> - Look, look there.<br> - A fire!<br> It's Lewis's place.<br> It's our place.<br> - Ryker lit it.<br> - He had no right.<br> He wouldn't have, if you hadn't left it.<br> I built it with my own hands.<br> - Not the girls' room.<br> - I was getting round to it.<br> If we stick together,<br> we can put that place back up.<br> - Can't we?<br> - Right.<br> We'll help you build the room,<br> Johnson and Joe.<br> - Shane'll help.<br> - Yeah.<br> We'll get the timber<br> and put it right back up, right?<br> - Yes, sir! We'll do it.<br> - Me, too, I'll help.<br> - You'll do that for us?<br> - All that, just for us?<br> Not just for you, Martha,<br> for all of us in this valley.<br> Come and help.<br> Maybe we can save part of that.<br> - That's the spirit.<br> - Let's get to the Lewises' place.<br> Come on, men!<br> Boss! Looks like Lewis is going back.<br> Starrett's holding 'em together.<br> - He could set fire to mine.<br> - Stay on your ground.<br> He'll do us like he did Torrey.<br> - There's a law against killing.<br> - The law is three days' ride from here.<br> - You know that.<br> - What does that leave us with?<br> - Give me time.<br> - Who's gonna fight Ryker?<br> - He knows he's got us on the run.<br> - You men hang on...<br> - Hang on?<br> - I promise something's gonna be done.<br> But what, Joe?<br> Leave that to me.<br> I'll have it out with Ryker.<br> - You're taking on too much.<br> - If I have to kill him.<br> That's wrong. Don't even think that.<br> Starrett's got to go.<br> I've warned him twice, but he's<br> pig-headed. He'll have to pay for it.<br> Joe, you can't do it!<br> If the Lewises have the courage<br> to start over, I won't let them down.<br> But you can't go in town<br> to kill Ryker. He'll kill you.<br> Tell him I'm a reasonable man,<br> things have gone far enough.<br> Tell him I'm beat, anything,<br> but, by Jupiter, get him here!<br> He'll come.<br> He thinks he's a reasonable man.<br> Hello, Calloway.<br> - He'll kill you.<br> - It's a chance I gotta take.<br> This is a false square knot, Joey,<br> it won't hold.<br> Shane! Tell him he can't go.<br> Tell him it won't work. Tell him!<br> Shane!<br> Wait, Joe, till things cool off.<br> Wait that long, anyway.<br> That's right, isn't it, Shane?<br> I can't tell Joe what's right, Marian.<br> Please wait, Joe.<br> Won't you do even this for me?<br> Starrett?<br> Mr Starrett!<br> - Who is it?<br> - Peace party, from Ryker.<br> One of you can come across and talk.<br> - Stay out of that garden.<br> - We ain't armed.<br> Brother Rufe wants to see you.<br> He says to tell you<br> he's a reasonable man.<br> He's responsible for Torrey's killing.<br> My brother wouldn't kill anybody.<br> He don't wanna go to jail.<br> Torrey was a hot-head,<br> he picked on a stranger.<br> Torrey didn't wanna be reasonable.<br> You wanna be reasonable, don't you?<br> I always figured on being reasonable.<br> My brother's waiting.<br> He'll see you at Grafton's.<br> Who else?<br> Not us. We're heading home.<br> I'll see your brother.<br> Shane!<br> Shane.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Calloway. Chris Calloway.<br> - Stay where you are. I can drill you.<br> - Hold it, I got something to tell you.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Starrett's up against a stacked deck.<br> Bang! Bang!<br> Bang! Bang!<br> - Why are you telling me?<br> - I reckon something's come over me.<br> - I don't figure.<br> - I'm quitting Ryker.<br> - So long.<br> - Chris...<br> Thanks.<br> Be seeing you.<br> No use to argue, Marian.<br> I'm going into this with my eyes open.<br> No!<br> Isn't there anything I can say<br> to change things?<br> Maybe this is a chance.<br> Morgan and them boys went home...<br> You don't really believe that,<br> that's not the reason.<br> It's just too much for me to give up,<br> this place and our valley...<br> - All the things that will be.<br> - Will be!<br> Bang!<br> Bang, bang, bang!<br> Joey, don't point that thing!<br> Go play outside.<br> Play outside, Joey!<br> Please, dear. Go outside and play.<br> It's just pride, that's all,<br> a silly kind of a pride.<br> Don't I mean anything to you, Joe?<br> Doesn't Joey?<br> Marian...<br> Honey, it's because you mean<br> so much to me that I've got to go.<br> Could I go on living with you,<br> and you thinking I'd showed yellow?<br> And what about Joey?<br> How would I explain that to him?<br> Oh, Joe...<br> Joe!<br> I've been thinking a lot, and...<br> ...I know I'm kinda slow sometimes,<br> but I see things...<br> And I know if anything happened to me<br> that you'd be took care of.<br> You'd be took care of,<br> better than I could do it myself.<br> I never thought I'd live<br> to hear myself say that, but...<br> I guess now's a pretty good time<br> to lay things bare.<br> You talk as though<br> I'd be glad for you to go.<br> Honey, you're the most honest<br> and the finest girl that ever lived.<br> I couldn't do what I gotta do if I hadn't<br> always known I could trust you.<br> Now, don't you go counting me out!<br> I wouldn't have lived this long<br> if I wasn't pretty tough.<br> Pa! Shane's got his gun on.<br> He's coming!<br> Gun?<br> - What's the idea?<br> - Don't let him go. Don't anybody go!<br> - This is my kind of game.<br> - But it ain't yours.<br> Maybe you're a match for Ryker, maybe<br> not, but you're no match for Wilson.<br> Then, I'll outlast him.<br> But I do appreciate it, Shane.<br> You're both out of your senses.<br> This isn't worth a life.<br> Are you fighting for this shack,<br> this ground and nothing but work?<br> I'm sick of it, I'm sick of trouble.<br> Let's move, let's go on, please!<br> Marian, don't say that!<br> You love this place more than me.<br> - Not any more.<br> - Even if it's true, it changes nothing.<br> There must be some way, Shane?<br> Some way?<br> - It's no use, Joe.<br> - No use? What's stopping me?<br> - I am.<br> - Get out of my way.<br> - Am I gonna have to fight you, too?<br> - That depends on you.<br> Stop!<br> Stop!<br> Shane! You hit him with your gun!<br> I hate you!<br> - Walk him around when he comes to.<br> - Joey, bring water and a towel.<br> Here, Marian. Hide this.<br> He'll be all right.<br> No one can blame him<br> for not keeping that date.<br> Shane... Wait!<br> - You were through with gunfighting.<br> - I changed my mind.<br> Are you doing this just for me?<br> For you, Marian...<br> ...and Joe and little Joe.<br> Then we'll never see you again?<br> Never's a long time, Marian.<br> Tell him...<br> Tell him I was sorry.<br> No need to tell him that.<br> Please, Shane...<br> Mother...<br> Please...<br> Take care of yourself.<br> Mother! Pa's coming along all right.<br> Yes, Joey.<br> - Why did Shane...?<br> - Shane did what he had to do.<br> - You don't hate Shane.<br> - I know, Mother.<br> Shane...!<br> I'm sorry!<br> He didn't hear you.<br> Shane!<br> Shane! I'm sorry!<br> I came to get your offer, Ryker.<br> I'm not dealing with you.<br> Where's Starrett?<br> - You're dealing with me, Ryker.<br> - I got no quarrel with you, Shane.<br> You can walk out now<br> and no hard feeling.<br> - What's your offer, Ryker?<br> - To you, not a thing.<br> - That's too bad.<br> - Too bad.<br> You've lived too long.<br> Your kind of days are over.<br> - My days? And yours, gunfighter?<br> - The difference is I know it.<br> So we'll turn in our six-guns<br> to the bartender,<br> and we'll all start hoeing spuds,<br> is that it?<br> Not quite yet.<br> We haven't heard from your friend here.<br> I wouldn't push too far if I were you.<br> Our fight ain't with you.<br> - It ain't with me, Wilson?<br> - No, it ain't, Shane.<br> I wouldn't pull on Wilson, Shane.<br> Will, you're a witness to this.<br> So you're Jack Wilson.<br> What's that mean to you, Shane?<br> I've heard about you.<br> What have you heard, Shane?<br> I've heard that you're<br> a low-down, Yankee liar.<br> Prove it!<br> Shane, look out!<br> Shane!<br> I knew you could, Shane.<br> I knew it just as well as anything.<br> Was that him? Was that Wilson?<br> That was him.<br> That was Wilson, all right.<br> He was fast, fast on the draw.<br> Joey, what are you doing here?<br> - I'm sorry, Shane.<br> - You don't have to be.<br> - You'd better run back.<br> - Can't I ride home behind you?<br> I'm afraid not, Joey.<br> Please! Why not?<br> I gotta be going on.<br> Why, Shane?<br> A man has to be what he is, Joey.<br> Can't break the mould.<br> - I tried it and it didn't work for me.<br> - We want you, Shane.<br> Joey, there's no living with a killing.<br> There's no going back from one.<br> Right or wrong, it's a brand.<br> A brand sticks.<br> There's no going back.<br> Now you run on home to your mother,<br> and tell her...<br> ...tell her everything's all right and<br> there aren't any more guns in the valley.<br> Shane...<br> It's bloody! You're hurt!<br> I'm all right, Joey.<br> Go home to your mother and father<br> and grow up to be strong and straight.<br> And, Joey...<br> Take care of them, both of them.<br> Yes, Shane.<br> He'd never have shot you<br> if you'd seen him!<br> Bye, little Joe.<br> He'd never even have cleared<br> the holster, would he, Shane?<br> Pa's got things for you to do!<br> And Mother wants you!<br> I know she does!<br> Shane!<br> Shane!<br> Come back!<br>
