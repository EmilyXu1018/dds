                        - Has the Shanghai Express gone?<br> - No, madam.<br> I want a ticket to Shanghai, first class.<br> - Is there a dining car this time?<br> - Yes, everything but a Turkish bath.<br> Hm!<br> Shanghai, first class, please.<br> - What you got in that basket, missus?<br> - A little lunch from my niece.<br> - No animals in there?<br> - I hope not!<br> Good morning, sir.<br> Porter! Come in here.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - I won't share with this woman.<br> - Change it tonight.<br> - Change me now.<br> I haven't lived here for ten years<br> not to know a woman like that.<br> Take my luggage out of here.<br> - Here you are, Harvey.<br> - Thanks very much.<br> - You're in for a good time.<br> - Why?<br> Do you know who's on this train?<br> Shanghai Lily.<br> - Who's Shanghai Lily?<br> - Don't say you've never heard of her.<br> She's a notorious coaster.<br> What in the name of Confucius<br> is a coaster?<br> You're hopeless. It's a woman who lives<br> by her wits along the China coast.<br> News boy!<br> Here, wait a bit.<br> This magazine says August 15th 1927.<br> - Yes, madam.<br> - But it's four years old.<br> Latest number, madam.<br> Is this 1931 or am I out of my mind?<br> Madame, je regrette<br> que je ne vous comprends pas.<br> Je ne parle pas anglais.<br> Parlez-vous franais?<br> Parlez-vous franais?<br> She oughta keep it for her history<br> and get an education.<br> Here we are, boy.<br> You'll be as glad to be at home as I will.<br> We know what year it is, don't we?<br> Be a good boy and don't make a noise<br> or they'll put you in the baggage car.<br> There you are, my lad. All clear till you meet<br> number two outside Tientsin.<br> I'll have the law on you<br> if you harm a bone in his head.<br> He's got to have his biscuits twice a day,<br> and nothing but boiled water!<br> Don't worry, Waffles, I'll look after you.<br> All aboard!<br> All aboard!<br> Well, we're off on time.<br> Say, partner, do you ever make a bet?<br> My name's Sam Salt.<br> I bet on everything going right or wrong.<br> I'll bet this old rattler<br> don't get into Shanghai on time.<br> Sir, let me remind you that China<br> is in a state of civil war<br> and we will be fortunate<br> if we arrive in Shanghai at all.<br> Nice stone you have there.<br> There's a mate to it.<br> Very pretty.<br> - C'est chaud ici, monsieur, n'est-ce pas?<br> - Yes, it is a little stuffy in here, isn't it?<br> Sir, I am an invalid, I must not travel<br> in a compartment with open windows.<br> We'll be in here for three days.<br> Is there anything I can do for you?<br> I can take care of myself, thank you.<br> I think I'll get a little air, if you don't mind.<br> I'll close the door for you, too.<br> Even money we don't get away for an hour.<br> Can you tell me what's wrong now?<br> You're in China now, sir,<br> where time and life have no value.<br> I know I'm in China.<br> Magdalen.<br> Well, Doctor,<br> I haven't seen you in a long time.<br> You haven't changed at all, Doctor.<br> Well, you've changed a lot, Magdalen.<br> Have I, Doc?<br> Do you mind me calling you Doc?<br> Or must I be... more respectful?<br> You never were respectful<br> and you always did call me Doc.<br> I didn't think I'd ever run into you again.<br> Have you thought of me much, Doc?<br> Let's see. Exactly how long has it been?<br> Five years and four weeks.<br> Well, for five years and four weeks<br> I've thought of nothing else.<br> You were always polite, Doc.<br> You haven't changed a bit.<br> You have, Magdalen.<br> You've changed a lot.<br> Have I lost my looks?<br> No, you're more beautiful than ever.<br> - How have I changed?<br> - I wish I could describe it.<br> Well, Doc, I've changed my name.<br> - Married?<br> - No.<br> It took more than one man<br> to change my name<br> to Shanghai Lily.<br> So you're Shanghai Lily.<br> The notorious white flower of China.<br> You heard of me.<br> And you always believed what you heard.<br> And I still do.<br> You see, I haven't changed at all.<br> It was nice to see you again, Magdalen.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I heard your gramophone, ladies,<br> and thought I'd come and get acquainted.<br> Come in.<br> It's a bit lonely on a train.<br> I'm used to having people around.<br> They put my dog in the baggage car.<br> That's why I dropped in on you.<br> I've been visiting my niece in Peking,<br> she married a seafarer.<br> He's been away four years<br> and she ain't been cheerful.<br> I have a boarding house in Shanghai.<br> Yorkshire pudding is my speciality.<br> I only take the most respectable people.<br> Don't you find respectable<br> people terribly... dull?<br> Are you joking?<br> I only know the most respectable people.<br> I keep a boarding house.<br> What kind of a house did you say?<br> A boarding house.<br> Ooh.<br> I'm sure you're very respectable, madam.<br> I must confess, I don't quite know<br> the standard of respectability<br> that you demand in your boarding house,<br> Mrs Haggerty.<br> I have made a terrible mistake.<br> I'd better look after me dog.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> - I beg yours!<br> They shouldn't allow such women on a train.<br> What's wrong with them, Parson?<br> I imagine the honourable divine<br> objects to their morals.<br> I thought they were pretty good-looking.<br> At least, Shanghai Lily is.<br> You mean to say that Shanghai Lily<br> is on this train?<br> - Hot water, sir.<br> - It's about time.<br> Being a married man, I only know her<br> by sight and reputation.<br> But I'll lay you 100-1 in any currency<br> that the lady in the next compartment<br> is Shanghai Lily.<br> - Shanghai Lily.<br> - Is it a bet?<br> I told you once before, sir, no thank you.<br> I don't bet.<br> I'll bet you whatever you use for money<br> that those two dames are not<br> going to have an easy time on this train.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Shall we be in Tientsin soon?<br> - About 11 tonight. Getting off there?<br> I wish I were. Unfortunately,<br> I have to proceed to Shanghai.<br> Why unfortunately?<br> I suppose every train carries its cargo of sin<br> but this train is burdened with<br> more than its share.<br> - Sir, you seem distressed.<br> - My name's Carmichael,<br> doctor of divinity in the service of mankind.<br> Whom have I the honour of addressing?<br> My name is Donald Harvey,<br> doctor of medicine<br> in the service of His Majesty.<br> Charming to make your acquaintance.<br> Dr Harvey, I want to put you on your guard.<br> On my guard? Why, what's wrong?<br> One is yellow, the other is white,<br> but both their souls are rotten.<br> You interest me, Mr Carmichael.<br> I'm not exactly irreligious but...<br> being a physician I sometimes wonder<br> how a man like you can locate a soul<br> and, having located it,<br> diagnose its condition as rotten.<br> That's heathen talk, Doctor.<br> Any man with half an eye could see<br> that those women are on this train<br> in search of victims.<br> Very grave charge. I don't know<br> the Chinese woman but the other lady...<br> Confound it, that's Shanghai Lily.<br> I've been attending a man<br> who went out of his mind<br> after spending every penny on her.<br> And that's not all. She's wrecked<br> a dozen men up and down China.<br> You're mistaken. She's a friend of mine.<br> If I were in your boots,<br> I wouldn't brag about it.<br> Dinner is served.<br> Well, I'm ready.<br> I was hoping that you would<br> take us into dinner.<br> You seem upset, Doctor.<br> No, not at all.<br> This is Captain Harvey.<br> Miss Hui Fei.<br> - I'm glad to meet you, Captain Harvey.<br> - It's a great pleasure.<br> - Good evening, folks.<br> - Good evening.<br> Time to put on the nosebag.<br> I'll wait for you in the diner.<br> - Bon apptit, mademoiselle.<br> - Merci.<br> - Bon apptit, monsieur.<br> - Thank you, Major.<br> - Et bonsoir.<br> - Good evening, Major.<br> You're very cruel.<br> I reserve the privilege<br> of choosing my friends.<br> She's no friend of mine.<br> I was only trying to be decent.<br> - Professional courtesy?<br> - Call it what you like.<br> - New, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Bravery?<br> - Of sorts.<br> That's new too, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> It's very becoming.<br> Merci, monsieur.<br> Attendez un moment.<br> - Dsirez-vous vous asseoir, madame?<br> - Merci, monsieur.<br> Don't let those sardines get away, Major.<br> Trs bien, mon vieux.<br> Pardon me, please.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Coming into dinner, Captain?<br> Yes, of course. After you, sir.<br> Shut off those fans. I'm an invalid.<br> If those fans are shut off,<br> the rest of us will be invalids soon.<br> - Can we sit here?<br> - Je vous en prie.<br> - Sit down, Major.<br> - Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> What did he say?<br> He said we should get our passports<br> and go outside.<br> What do they want our passports for?<br> They are government troops,<br> they want us outside.<br> I won't get off. We'll all be killed.<br> The conductor promised me<br> there wouldn't be any trouble.<br> Don't get me excited. I'm trying to figure<br> the odds of getting out alive.<br> It's an outrage. I'm going to finish my dinner.<br> Mr Carmichael, I think you should consider<br> your dinner unimportant.<br> Arrtez a avant qu'on ait fini de dner.<br> I shall complain to my consul.<br> They can't do this to me.<br> I shouldn't get off, night air's bad for me.<br> Don't be silly, Mr Baum, we're in a civil war -<br> spy scares and firing squads.<br> I am a German citizen.<br> I have nothing to fear.<br> Ich bin ein deutscher Brger.<br> I'll take this off. They're after somebody<br> and they've got nothing on me.<br> O est-ce qu'il est encore?<br> J'ai assez de m'occuper de moi.<br> I don't know what you're saying, brother,<br> but don't say it again.<br> There you are, my boy.<br> All aboard!<br> A lot of fuss for one man.<br> Wonder why they arrested him.<br> Probably a revolutionary spy<br> trying to get back to his own lines.<br> - What do you want?<br> - It's a long journey, and a lonely one.<br> - Your compartment is made up, sir.<br> - Vous tes un bon garon.<br> Bonne nuit, monsieur. Dormez bien.<br> Someday that sardine inspector's<br> going to go too far.<br> Pardon me. Pardon me!<br> Verdammtes auslndisches Gesindel.<br> What did he say to you?<br> Something he'll probably have<br> occasion to regret.<br> I can't make head or tail out of you,<br> Mr Chang.<br> Are you Chinese, or are you white,<br> or what are you?<br> My mother was Chinese,<br> my father was white.<br> You look more like a white man.<br> I'm not proud of my white blood.<br> - You're not, are you?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - Rather be a Chinaman?<br> - Yes.<br> What future is there?<br> You're born, eat some rice, and you die.<br> What a country! Let's have a drink.<br> Do you want to be alone, Doctor?<br> No, it's quite all right.<br> I was just going to turn in anyway.<br> Don't let me detain you.<br> I thought it was quite early.<br> - What time is it?<br> - 9:30.<br> You still have the watch I gave you, Donald.<br> I was afraid you'd notice it.<br> - I had long hair then.<br> - I remember quite well.<br> Do you expect to stay in Shanghai a while?<br> I think so.<br> Then we ought to see a lot of each other.<br> Perhaps.<br> What have you been doing<br> since I saw you last?<br> Mostly service routine.<br> Couple of years in India after our smash-up.<br> I went back to England, then I was assigned<br> to an expedition in Manchuria.<br> Sounds as if you have been<br> rather lonesome, Doc.<br> I wasn't lonesome.<br> It was an active life full of excitement.<br> I suppose you mean women.<br> It was difficult to find someone<br> to take your place.<br> Did you try very hard?<br> Not particularly.<br> I didn't want to be hurt again.<br> Always a bit selfish, Doc,<br> thinking of your own hurt.<br> I can't accept your reproach.<br> I was the only one hurt.<br> You left me without a word purely<br> because I indulged in a woman's trick<br> to make you... jealous.<br> I wanted to be certain that you loved me.<br> Instead, I lost you.<br> I suffered quite a bit.<br> And I probably deserved it.<br> I was a fool to let you go out of my life.<br> I wish you could tell me<br> there'd been no other men.<br> I wish I could, Doc.<br> But five years in China is a long time.<br> I wish I had 'em back.<br> What would you have done with them?<br> There's a scheme of things. Sooner or later<br> we would have parted anyway.<br> - We might never have met again.<br> - We wouldn't have parted.<br> We'd have gone back to England,<br> married and been happy.<br> There are a lot of things I wouldn't have<br> done if I had those five years again.<br> There's only one thing I wouldn't have done.<br> What, for instance?<br> I wouldn't have bobbed my hair.<br> Good night, Donald.<br> - From one of your lovers?<br> - No.<br> - I wish I could believe you.<br> - Don't you?<br> Will you never learn to believe<br> without proof?<br> I believe you, Magdalen.<br> When I needed your faith, you withheld it.<br> And now, when I don't need it<br> and don't deserve it, you give it to me.<br> Waffles? Waffles?<br> Waffles? Waffles!<br> Waffles! Waffles!<br> Everybody is to get dressed. You are to be<br> taken from the train at the station.<br> Please leave all your luggage behind.<br> This way, please.<br> - This way, please.<br> - Quite a reception.<br> Me?<br> Yes, follow me upstairs.<br> Everybody told me there wasn't<br> the slightest danger.<br> Looks like the finish.<br> - I'll give anybody 10-1 we don't get out alive.<br> - You're wrong.<br> They're rebel troops but they won't harm us.<br> Say, where's Mr Chang?<br> C'est vrai, il n'est pas l.<br> I wouldn't be surprised if he had<br> something to do with this.<br> There must be something serious<br> or they wouldn't have stopped this train.<br> There is nothing behind it but robbery.<br> They won't get one penny out of me.<br> Mr Sam Salt.<br> It's Mr Chang, all dressed up<br> in a soldier's uniform.<br> I know what he wants me for.<br> And I told him a Chinaman had no future.<br> Do you mean to say Mr Chang<br> is responsible for this outrage?<br> He is, the scoundrel.<br> Such impudence,<br> asking me if I had any wealthy friends.<br> I knew they were holding us for ransom.<br> I thought his face seemed familiar.<br> The government has offered 20,000<br> for his capture alive or dead.<br> It will be a great day for China<br> when that price is paid.<br> Mr Eric Baum.<br> He's the head man, all right.<br> It's bad for my heart to climb these stairs up.<br> Verdammte Treppe!<br> I'm an invalid.<br> Did he get the jewels, Mr Salt?<br> Oh, what a shame.<br> He didn't take them after all.<br> - He got the phoney ones.<br> - Phony?<br> These are phony, too.<br> The real ones are in the safe in Shanghai.<br> I suppose they're imitation also.<br> You don't want to make a bet<br> on that, do you?<br> - I never bet with gamblers.<br> - I didn't think you did.<br> What is your business, Mr Baum?<br> I've a coal mine near Calcutta.<br> A bankrupt coal mine.<br> You have no coal mine.<br> According to papers found in your luggage,<br> you deal in opium<br> and have shipped 12,000 pounds of it<br> into China in the last year.<br> You are wrong. I deal only in coal.<br> I don't traffic in forbidden merchandise.<br> Do you know that a Chinaman<br> dealing in opium is penalised by death?<br> You can't shoot me. I'll pay a fine.<br> I can explain everything.<br> Here. Here, here!<br> I am not punishing you for dealing in opium<br> but for your insolence to me on the train.<br> What's the matter, has he fainted?<br> - They branded him.<br> - Branded him?<br> - I'll get oil from the train.<br> - I need my bag.<br> He shouldn't have made this journey.<br> Major Lenard.<br> Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? Je ne comprends rien.<br> - Does anyone understand French?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Come up here with him, please.<br> - Alors, il faut que je monte l haut?<br> You took the very words<br> out of my mouth, brother.<br> Let me see your passports. Sit down.<br> How long have you been<br> in the French army?<br> Your passport says nothing<br> about your military rank.<br> Je ne comprends pas.<br> Il dit que votre passeport ne mentionne pas<br> que voue tes dans I'arme.<br> J'ai demissionn.<br> Then why does he wear that uniform?<br> Pourquoi portez-vous I'uniforme?<br> Je vais voir ma soeur. Si elle se doutait<br> que j'ai t chass de I'arme<br> ce serait pour elle un tel chagrin...<br> He's going to visit his sister and he doesn't<br> want her to know about his disgrace.<br> - You may go.<br> - Merci, monsieur.<br> - Merci, mademoiselle.<br> - Merci de quoi?<br> Have you any wealthy or influential friends?<br> No, I have no friends at all.<br> Why are you going to Shanghai?<br> I want to buy a new hat.<br> I warn you, this is a very serious matter.<br> - Where will you live in Shanghai?<br> - Grand Hotel.<br> How can you afford to live<br> at such an expensive hotel?<br> - How long were you in Peiping?<br> - Eight weeks.<br> - And before that?<br> - In Shanghai.<br> - How long were you there?<br> - Just between trains.<br> I make the trip quite often.<br> How long have you been in China?<br> About eight years.<br> Parents living?<br> They have forgotten me. It's just as well.<br> - Of course, you're not married?<br> - No.<br> All I managed was to become engaged.<br> Will you please come with me?<br> - You're not going to go upstairs, are you?<br> - I most certainly am.<br> Captain Harvey, tell him that the worid<br> will be informed of this outrage.<br> Mr Carmichael, I shall do my very best<br> to convey that to him.<br> Captain Harvey, may I see your passport?<br> Who are you? I'm a British officer<br> and I demand to know<br> by what right you're treating us<br> in this outrageous manner.<br> I'm the commander in chief of the revolution.<br> The prisoner who was removed from<br> the Shanghai Express was my right hand -<br> an important officer in my army.<br> Your army - a collection<br> of unprincipled bandits.<br> The Chinese government will wipe you out.<br> Perhaps you would like to aid them<br> in collecting the price on my head.<br> Suppose you first tell me what you're after.<br> I'm looking for a hostage to force<br> the government to return my officer.<br> Now will you kindly let me<br> see your passport?<br> Why are you going to Shanghai?<br> I've been ordered to perform an operation<br> immediately upon my arrival.<br> Who are you going to operate on?<br> I'm not at liberty to reveal that information.<br> What is the matter with His Excellency,<br> the Governor General of Shanghai?<br> As you doubtlessly also can read<br> from the paper you pilfered from my bag,<br> hemiplegia.<br> A medical term known to the layman<br> as paralysis resulting<br> from a blood clot in the brain.<br> Well, it seems I have been fortunate<br> to find a hostage important enough<br> to ensure the return of my officer.<br> Surely you will have no objection<br> if I wire the British embassy?<br> What if my importance is insufficient<br> to force the Chinese government<br> to make this exchange?<br> That emergency<br> would be unfortunate for you all.<br> I can't hold this village over 12 hours.<br> I hope you won't be too angry with me<br> if I ensure the safety<br> of your honourable person?<br> Not at all.<br> What did he say?<br> We are to go back<br> to the train and stay there.<br> Big bully.<br> Yes?<br> Repeat that again, please.<br> Yes.<br> - The Shanghai Express has been held up.<br> - Shanghai Express?<br> They're holding Captain Harvey as hostage.<br> The surgeon. What do they want, money?<br> I wish it were as simple as that. Excuse me.<br> I must get through<br> to the Chinese government at once.<br> I hope you've been comfortable.<br> What do you intend to do with us?<br> I took the liberty of presuming<br> that you'd join me for tea.<br> I hope you don't mind<br> if I prefer to go back to the train.<br> About two days' journey<br> from here into the interior,<br> I have a palace waiting to be graced<br> by your presence.<br> Could I persuade you<br> to accept my hospitality<br> until such time as you should<br> grow weary of me?<br> I'm weary of you now.<br> I had no reason to believe my invitation<br> would give offence to Shanghai Lily.<br> Shanghai Lily has reformed.<br> You don't mean to say that the eloquence<br> of Dr Carmichael has worked this miracle?<br> Or is Captain Harvey to be credited<br> with this extraordinary change?<br> - Maybe.<br> - Come, don't be a fool.<br> I'll make it worth your while.<br> Don't touch me.<br> Captain Harvey, if I were you,<br> I'd mind my own business.<br> Exactly what I intend to do.<br> You are very fortunate in having<br> Captain Harvey for a protector,<br> as I have promised to return him alive.<br> You shouldn't have.<br> I could have taken care of myself.<br> It was coming to him. I wish I'd had my gun.<br> You shouldn't have been so hasty.<br> Leave that woman alone.<br> Let me go.<br> Can't you do something about this?<br> All I can do is to suggest<br> that you get down on your knees and pray.<br> I think you're right,<br> if God is still on speaking terms with me.<br> God remains on speaking terms<br> with everybody.<br> Well, there he is. The gent that caused<br> all the trouble, still in his black nightshirt.<br> Good morning. Well, here we are.<br> You are a sight for sore eyes.<br> When are we leaving?<br> - Is Captain Harvey on board?<br> - No, he's still up visiting with Mr Chang.<br> Well, I'll see what's keeping him.<br> - I've orders not to proceed without him.<br> - There's a man after my own heart.<br> - What did he say?<br> - We'll have to cool our heels.<br> They won't let me go upstairs to find out.<br> Don't do anything foolish.<br> - When are we leaving?<br> - I wish I knew.<br> As soon as Captain Harvey comes down.<br> If he's up there, he may never come down.<br> Why are you still holding Captain Harvey?<br> The train is waiting for him.<br> Is that your only interest?<br> What difference would it make<br> whether I said yes or no?<br> Why try to conceal<br> that you're madly in love with him?<br> I'm not trying to conceal anything.<br> He means everything in the worid to me.<br> I love him. As you want to know,<br> I love him madly.<br> Your affections are aroused rather swiftly.<br> You just met the man.<br> That's not true. I've known him for years.<br> You'll have a chance<br> to prove your love for him.<br> You're not going to punish him<br> for helping me last night?<br> I certainly am. He knew what he was doing.<br> And I know what I'm going to do.<br> You can't hold that against him.<br> I'm not concerned with your ideas of justice.<br> I live by my own code.<br> What do you intend to do? Don't dare<br> harm him. You promised to return him.<br> I didn't say in what condition.<br> If you wait here a few minutes,<br> you can lead him out, blind.<br> You're insane. He's a British officer.<br> The Chinese government<br> will have your head.<br> The Chinese government<br> would have had my head long ago<br> if it hadn't been such a good head.<br> You can't mean what you are saying.<br> You only wish to frighten me.<br> Please don't torture me.<br> I know it was wrong for him to interfere.<br> Send someone you can trust with me<br> to Shanghai. I'll pay you to let him go now.<br> What could you pay me with?<br> I have some jewels,<br> worth 40 or 50 thousand,<br> and I guess I can obtain that much more.<br> That's not enough.<br> I'll get more. I'll earn more, somehow.<br> It'll be enough. Please let him go.<br> All the money in the worid<br> can't wipe out his insult to me.<br> You only had my interest before.<br> Now you have my admiration.<br> I could love a woman like you.<br> You made me an offer to leave with you.<br> Does it still hold good?<br> I wouldn't trust you from here to the door.<br> What assurance have I you won't trick me?<br> I give you my word of honour.<br> A man is a fool to trust any woman.<br> But I believe a word of honour<br> would mean something to you.<br> Captain Harvey,<br> it seems that they are waiting for you.<br> I hope the journey won't be too lonely.<br> And that the Governor General of Shanghai<br> will be benefited by your skill.<br> Thank you, Mr Chang.<br> I hope some day to have the pleasure<br> of demonstrating my skill upon you.<br> Captain Harvey, I'm Albright,<br> Division Superintendent.<br> The train is ready.<br> We'll have steam up in five minutes.<br> All right. Is everybody on board?<br> Everybody except a Chinese girl and<br> a woman called Shanghai Lily hereabouts.<br> - Where are they?<br> - I don't know about the girl<br> but Shanghai Lily's up there.<br> - When did she go up?<br> - Just a few minutes ago.<br> I expect she'll be down presently.<br> - I guess he wants us to go in the train.<br> - Well, why doesn't he say so?<br> - Whose luggage are you unloading?<br> - Miss Lily's bags. Officer's orders, sir.<br> Officer's orders, eh?<br> I'm going up to find out about this.<br> Get the train ready to leave.<br> Oh dear, we'll never get out of here alive.<br> I don't know. It just looks like<br> Shanghai Lily was taking a side trip.<br> Why did you order the luggage<br> of one of our passengers off the train?<br> You're not referring to Shanghai Lily?<br> I am. Why are you detaining her?<br> I'm not detaining her.<br> She's decided to come with me<br> in preference to continuing the journey<br> with you, Captain Harvey.<br> That's a preposterous statement.<br> You're lying.<br> Well, I'm sorry to contradict you.<br> Your friend seems inclined to doubt me.<br> Tell him you're going with me<br> of your own free will<br> so that he can peacefully take his departure<br> before I become too annoyed with him.<br> You better go, Donald.<br> I decided to accept his offer.<br> Well, I wish you both<br> a very pleasant journey.<br> Well, that's that.<br> I'll only be another minute.<br> Wake them up a bit.<br> We're ready to go, sir.<br> Are we waiting for the two women?<br> Yes, I think we're ready to go.<br> - All aboard.<br> - All aboard!<br> All aboard!<br> You'd better get her out of here.<br> I've just killed Chang.<br> Have you got a gun?<br> If there's gonna be any shooting,<br> I'm gonna get under cover.<br> - Magdalen!<br> - Donald!<br> - Come on, our train's waiting.<br> - Why don't you go?<br> Go on, I tell you. Your friend Chang is dead.<br> Come on.<br> Get this train out of here double time.<br> Put that luggage on board.<br> - Thank you, Donald.<br> - I'd have done it for anybody.<br> Boy, how about straightening up this stable?<br> I didn't believe I'd ever see this train again.<br> Two days more.<br> What time is it, anyway?<br> I don't know. I'll find out for you, if you wish.<br> Where's your watch?<br> I probably lost it in the station,<br> together with a few ideals.<br> I don't think I'll go back for it.<br> After all, it's only a watch.<br> I can't replace your ideals<br> but I'll buy you another watch<br> when we get to Shanghai.<br> Don't bother. I'm rather glad I lost it.<br> I don't know if I ought to be grateful<br> to you or not.<br> It's of no consequence. I didn't do it for you.<br> Death cancel his debt to me.<br> There. That'll keep you for a while.<br> Bonsoir madame, monsieur.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Vous me permettez de me joindre vous?<br> I'll be glad when I get to Shanghai.<br> So will I.<br> - How's the invalid, Doctor?<br> - He'll be all right in a few weeks.<br> More than I can say for myself.<br> If you opened me up, you'd find my nerves<br> tangled up like Chinese noodles.<br> This journey hasn't done<br> any of us any good.<br> Except that Chinese dame.<br> She's 20,000 to the good for settling<br> the hash of the honourable Mr Chang.<br> I wish I'd taken a crack at him first.<br> How about you, Major?<br> Je regrette, monsieur, mais je ne<br> comprends pas un seul mot que vous dites.<br> It's a lucky thing for him that you are here.<br> I won't feel right till I get back<br> to my boarding house.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Bonsoir, monsieur.<br> I've never been so shocked in my life.<br> The Chinese girl deserves all she's getting.<br> But as for the other lady, well,<br> I'm not gonna say anything.<br> Of all the brazen creatures,<br> playing the gramophone.<br> She's the most terrible woman I've ever met.<br> I don't see how she can<br> look us in the eye.<br> Going off with the Mr Chang<br> after the way he treated us.<br> Bad enough before he held up the train<br> but after he tortured Mr Baum...<br> I think you're doing the woman an injustice.<br> I don't know why she behaved that way but<br> I'm sure there's more to this than we see.<br> Mr Carmichael, when I made<br> your acquaintance yesterday,<br> you volunteered an amazingly correct<br> diagnosis of Shanghai Lily<br> and I see no reason<br> for you to have changed it.<br> Look here, I happen to know<br> she prayed all night for your safety.<br> I'd give anything to believe that<br> but I heard from her own lips<br> she was leaving with Chang.<br> - That's rubbish.<br> - I wish it were.<br> Defending that dame. I'm liberal,<br> but I wouldn't back his viewpoint<br> for all the rice in China.<br> Neither would I.<br> I'd like to talk to you alone.<br> I don't wish to talk to anybody.<br> I'm sorry to have to insist<br> but I must talk to you.<br> If you're thinking of reforming me,<br> you might as well save yourself the trouble.<br> I am not trying to reform anybody right now.<br> I want to settle something<br> that's been puzzling me.<br> Why did you decide to leave<br> with that barbarian who was killed by her?<br> What makes you want to know? Curiosity?<br> You prayed last night.<br> This morning, you were<br> to shamelessly leave with Chang.<br> A human being can't do two things<br> like that within six hours.<br> Although it's nobody's affair but mine,<br> I might tell you<br> if you promise not to repeat it.<br> Of course I won't repeat it.<br> I came to find out for myself.<br> He was going to deprive Captain Harvey<br> of his eyesight.<br> I had no other choice.<br> Does Captain Harvey know that?<br> - Does he act as if he did?<br> - He certainly does not.<br> Despite giving you my word,<br> I'm going to tell him this.<br> You're not going to do anything of the kind.<br> Mr Carmichael, it may seem odd<br> for me to use your language<br> but it's purely a question of faith.<br> You see, once upon a time,<br> we loved each other.<br> We parted and I threw my life away<br> because I didn't care<br> to bargain for love with words.<br> I haven't changed since then<br> and neither has he.<br> You're still in love with him, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Is he still in love with you?<br> - I doubt it.<br> - You're right.<br> Love without faith, like religion without faith,<br> doesn't amount to very much.<br> I don't suppose I can help you.<br> No.<br> Did you find out<br> what kind of a woman she is?<br> Enough to realise<br> that she's worth a dozen of you.<br> I've no exaggerated idea of my own value<br> but what did she say to make you<br> so emphatic on that point?<br> She made me promise not to tell anyone,<br> particularly you,<br> but there's no restriction to my saying<br> that you're a profound fool.<br> Be that as it may, you evidently<br> place a great deal of faith<br> in what Shanghai Lily says.<br> You men of science regard me<br> and my kind as meddlesome fanatics<br> but I'd rather have one grain of my faith<br> than all your scientific disbelief.<br> You haven't a cigarette, have you, Doc?<br> You appear to be nervous.<br> Sleep would do you more good.<br> What makes you think I'm nervous?<br> One thing, your hands are trembling.<br> That's because you touched me, Doc.<br> I've been wanting to talk you.<br> Mr Carmichael tells me<br> you prayed for me last night.<br> I can't quite reconcile that<br> with what followed.<br> If you did pray for me, which I doubt,<br> do you mind telling me why?<br> I would have done that for anybody, Doc.<br> Good night.<br> Good old Shanghai,<br> never thought I'd see you again.<br> - Oh, que je suis contente de te voir!<br> - Je suis content, moi aussi.<br> Did you kill him with a knife or a revolver?<br> Is your home in Peking or is it Shanghai?<br> Killed him with a knife, didn't you?<br> - Welcome to Shanghai.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Good morning. How are you?<br> Very kind of you to come down here.<br> Goodbye. How do you do?<br> Au revoir, monsieur.<br> Au revoir, madame.<br> Goodbye. Pleased to meet you. Goodbye.<br> Right outside. Goodbye.<br> Glad to have made your acquaintance.<br> Likewise. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs Haggerty.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, Captain Harvey.<br> I owe you my life and I won't forget it.<br> Though, between you and me,<br> it isn't worth much.<br> - This is yours? I'll put it in the car.<br> - Yes.<br> - You won't be long?<br> - I'll come now.<br> We'd have all been in a pickle if you...<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Clarke, how are you?<br> - We thought you'd never turn up.<br> - I always do, like a bad penny.<br> I hope you pull the governor through.<br> If you ever want to lay a bet<br> on those gee-gees...<br> Goodbye. It's nice to have the journey over.<br> Goodbye, Mr Carmichael.<br> Good luck. Come along, Carey.<br> - Au revoir, mademoiselle.<br> - Au revoir, Major.<br> - Madame Rogot, my sister.<br> - Enchante, mademoiselle.<br> Mademoiselle a t trs bonne pour moi.<br> Merci, mademoiselle.<br> Il exaggre, je n'ai pas fait grand-chose.<br> - Au revoir, mademoiselle.<br> - Au revoir.<br> All set, Harvey.<br> All right. I'll be along in a minute.<br> I've got to attend to something.<br> We'll wait.<br> Forgive me for following you a moment ago.<br> I was afraid of losing you.<br> I was only buying you another watch.<br> What good is a watch without you?<br> I wish I could replace everything else, too.<br> Goodbye, Donald.<br> I won't let you out of my life again.<br> Everything else has become so unimportant.<br> I don't care if you were going to leave<br> with him. I don't care why.<br> All I want is another chance for a new start.<br> I'll be different.<br> You'll never have any cause for regret.<br> Please forgive me for my lack of faith.<br> Please do.<br> I know I've no right to ask you<br> even to listen to me.<br> It's very easy to listen to you.<br> You know I love you.<br> I always have and I always will.<br> I don't deserve that. I know I behaved badly.<br> Perhaps it was my fault.<br> I should have told you everything.<br> There's only one thing I want you to tell me.<br> What's that?<br> How in the name of Confucius<br> can I kiss you with all these people around?<br> But, Donald, there's no one here<br> but you and I.<br> Besides, many lovers come<br> to railroad stations to kiss<br> without attracting attention.<br>
