                        You saw the fight last night?<br> I was reading about it. Says it was great.<br> - It was rotten.<br> - What was the matter with it?<br> I expected a fight to the finish. But in<br> the 77th round the guy got yellow and quit.<br> That certainly is a bird of a picture.<br> So help me,<br> I never saw a woman more beautiful.<br> It's just come this morning.<br> Gus didn't wait for his breakfast<br> before he had it stuck up there.<br> A guy don't need any breakfast<br> when he can look at her.<br> She is beautiful.<br> I wish she'd take a shine to me.<br> You better not let Gus Jordan<br> hear you say that...<br> or you'll be picking lead out of your pants.<br> When did that crawl in here?<br> Hit him on the back<br> before he chokes to death.<br> This ought to learn you<br> that free lunch is meant to be ate.<br> And not stored for the winter.<br> Hello, where've you been?<br> Ain't seen you<br> since Sweeney Carson croaked your girl.<br> Been away on important business.<br> I'll be around a lot from now on.<br> - How are you, boys?<br> - Fine.<br> Hi, boys, drinks are on me.<br> - Been waiting long?<br> - About 15 minutes.<br> - When did the painting go up there?<br> - This morning.<br> I think I got the dope<br> on how to get Jordan this time...<br> and get him right.<br> Gus seems to be sitting as tight as ever, Dan.<br> Don't you believe it.<br> Just because he's running for sheriff<br> and stands in good with the higher-ups...<br> don't mean he can't be showed up.<br> Pretty soon, I'll be standing in his shoes<br> as boss of this here district. And then...<br> And you figure she goes<br> along with that honour, Dan?<br> I always thought you were warm for her.<br> Yes, I got to admit it.<br> This is my first big chance.<br> Jordan's playing a crooked game.<br> So far he's kept under cover.<br> But once I get hold of something I can take<br> to the district attorney...<br> Gus'll be out and I'll be in.<br> Then it'll all be over but the celebrating.<br> She ain't no easy gal to handle, Flynn.<br> I know that. She's a pretty slick article.<br> When Chick was sent up the river,<br> she blowed into Jordan's arms...<br> just for protection,<br> and he's too blind to see it.<br> Sure, he's all puffed up over himself.<br> Do you believe it?<br> He actually thinks she's in love with him.<br> Ever since I sang that song,<br> it's been haunting me.<br> It should haunt you. You murdered it.<br> - You play that like it'll hurt you.<br> - It does.<br> No, I'm moody that way, see.<br> Say, boss, I got a brand new tune, just out.<br> Yeah? What is it?<br> It's called After The Ball Is Over.<br> Play it.<br> Kelly, that'll be a great song for Lou.<br> She's getting famous.<br> Tony Pastor himself offered to sign her up<br> for his music hall.<br> You don't mean Tony Pastor<br> way uptown on 14th Street?<br> Yes, that's the one.<br> Pastor says that Lou's got it<br> all over Della Fox.<br> Hello, Mrs. Meg.<br> - Mrs. Flaherty, I'm disappointed in you.<br> - Disappointed in me?<br> Just because I come here with me little can.<br> Sure, a pint of beer will hurt nobody no time.<br> It's not only that. I'm disappointed<br> at not seeing you at the mission.<br> - At the mission?<br> - See here, Cummings.<br> What is it, Jordan?<br> I thought you'd given up the idea<br> of trying to reform my place.<br> - No, I'm still hopeful.<br> - Hopeful?<br> I'm not going to have you people<br> interfering in my business.<br> Before you started that mission next door,<br> we never had any trouble around here.<br> I've heard differently.<br> But if what you say is true,<br> I'd only be too glad to be mistaken.<br> Now, see here, Cummings,<br> I'm telling you again.<br> I'm not going to have my customers<br> driven away.<br> Why, I wouldn't think<br> of doing such a thing, Jordan.<br> - Hey, Jordan.<br> - Yeah.<br> - How are you, Gus?<br> - Hello, Flynn.<br> - How are you?<br> - Great.<br> - Have a drink?<br> - Sure.<br> - Set up over there.<br> - Right, boss.<br> Haven't seen you here for more<br> than a month. Where have you been?<br> Here, there, and everywhere.<br> City's getting so big,<br> it takes time to get around it.<br> One of these days, we'll be walking<br> across a bridge to Long Island City.<br> Walking? We'll be riding over<br> in one of them horseless buggies.<br> I'm thinking of buying one of them<br> for me and Lou.<br> - By the way, Gus, how is she?<br> - She's in demand, I tell you, Flynn.<br> The Bowery Savings Bank<br> and Rupert's Brewery...<br> are fighting to use her pictures exclusive<br> on their New Year's calendars.<br> She sure is a handsome girl, Gus.<br> I wonder you don't get jealous,<br> all the men are so crazy about her.<br> I do get kind of mad at the attention<br> some of them show her.<br> But it ain't bad,<br> having a girl that all the men are after.<br> Shows I must be pretty good, eh, Flynn?<br> Take a look at that.<br> Just bought it for her. Ain't that a pip?<br> Big as a nickel.<br> What would you do if somebody tried<br> to take her away from you?<br> Probably, nothing...<br> to her.<br> Say, the flies here are terrible.<br> You pick out the ones you don't like<br> and I'll kill them for you.<br> - Someone wants to talk to you in the office.<br> - All right, Spider.<br> - Excuse me, Dan.<br> - Sure.<br> Lou is the swellest girl<br> that ever came down the Bowery.<br> You fellas don't know nothing about Lou.<br> But I do.<br> Just before the battle, Mother<br> - When did you get in, Rita?<br> - Two days ago.<br> But I did not come here direct,<br> you understand.<br> Good girl, Rita. Take no chances.<br> We are very discreet, Serge and me.<br> Gus, you must like Serge.<br> He's been a most valuable assistant.<br> - Sure you can trust him?<br> - You know Rita.<br> We've got to be especially careful.<br> I can't take chances of having headquarters<br> watching around this way.<br> - They will find nothing.<br> - No, not if we stay awake.<br> But don't forget. No talking to anyone.<br> Rita never talks.<br> - But are you sure about Lou?<br> - She doesn't know a thing.<br> Say, she's out of this. Understand? Out of it.<br> Of course, Gus, if you say so.<br> Serge, we were talking<br> about Gus' friend, Lou.<br> Yes, I have heard of her.<br> She's very beautiful, yes?<br> More beautiful than these?<br> She makes them look<br> like a bunch of dishwashers.<br> Hello, Mickey.<br> Lady Lou, you're a fine girl, a fine woman.<br> One of the finest women<br> ever walked the streets.<br> - How are the girls today?<br> - Just fine, Miss Lou.<br> - Hello, Rita.<br> - Why, Lou, I'm so very happy to see you.<br> - Glad to see you back.<br> - Yes.<br> Lou, this is Serge Stanieff.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> Take a look at this, Gus,<br> and learn something.<br> I am delighted.<br> I have heard so much about you.<br> Yeah, but you can't prove it.<br> Serge is my new assistant, Lou.<br> Day or night work, Rita?<br> He should be a big help.<br> - You got the pictures, Lou?<br> - Yeah, I had them taken with all my rocks.<br> Wait till you take a look at these.<br> - I kind of like that one.<br> - Yes, this one is beautiful.<br> - And this gives me a lot of style and dignity.<br> - Sure is a pip, Lou.<br> Wait till you see this.<br> For the bedroom. A little bit spicy,<br> but not too raw, you know what I mean?<br> - Want to see the pictures?<br> - Yes, I would like very much to see them.<br> Don't be backward. I'm not.<br> They're wonderful. But I like best<br> that marvellous painting of you in the bar.<br> Yeah, I got to admit that is a flash,<br> but I do wish Gus hadn't hung it up...<br> over the free lunch.<br> Mike, you sure took long enough.<br> What've you been doing up there?<br> I was looking at all the beautiful things.<br> Looks like heaven.<br> That's why you gotta climb stairs<br> to get there.<br> - Is that all, Miss Lou?<br> - You can go.<br> Thank you.<br> Mike and his horses<br> are as famous as this dance hall.<br> The only difference, the horses are sober.<br> Yeah, you're sure a pip, Lou.<br> I suppose I'll be seeing you around, Rita?<br> Oh, yes.<br> And you Mr...<br> Come, Rita, let's get this business over with.<br> - Spider, see that I'm not disturbed<br> by anyone. Come, Rita.<br> All right, boss.<br> Serge, come.<br> Pearl?<br> - Here I come.<br> - Come on, honey.<br> - I just loves to work for you, Miss Lou.<br> - Yeah?<br> You buy such pretty things.<br> And all them diamonds.<br> - You're so rich.<br> - Yes. I wasn't always rich.<br> No?<br> There was a time I didn't know<br> where my next husband was coming from.<br> Yeah, but I means is you ain't never been<br> in the circumstances...<br> where the wolf came to your door.<br> The wolf at my door?<br> Why, I remember when he came<br> right into my room and had pups.<br> - Well?<br> - A pint, Kelly.<br> - Did you fix it like I told you, Mrs. Cassidy?<br> - No.<br> Always take a bit of butter<br> and rub it at the bottom of the can.<br> - That kills the suds.<br> - Is that so?<br> I never thought of that at all.<br> - Why didn't you<br> tell me that before?<br> - I don't know.<br> Spider?<br> - Yeah, what's the matter?<br> - Look at that.<br> I got it. Get out of the way.<br> - Get out of the way.<br> Give her some air, will you?<br> What's the trouble?<br> This girl tried to croak herself,<br> but they stopped her before she could.<br> All right, Spider, bring her up.<br> Bill, fix up something for her.<br> Right away, Lou.<br> Think of trying to bump herself off in here,<br> of all places.<br> She come to the right place, all right.<br> - What do I do with the kid, Lou?<br> - Put her right over here, Spider.<br> - Where's Gus?<br> He's down in his office. He left word<br> not to be disturbed for anything.<br> Thanks. You go downstairs<br> and shut that crowd up, will you?<br> You can go, Spider. I'll look after her.<br> Poor kid looks like she is all in.<br> She must have been up against it<br> to want to croak herself.<br> Come on, take this. Here.<br> Come on. This will fix you up.<br> - What's the matter? Committed murder?<br> - No, not that. I never will.<br> Then you have nothing to worry about.<br> At least the guy is alive.<br> How did you know there was a man?<br> There always is.<br> It takes two to get one in trouble.<br> You know everything about me.<br> I wouldn't say that, but I am observant.<br> Come on, move over here.<br> Sit down there.<br> What was he? Married?<br> Yes, but I didn't know.<br> Makes no difference to me<br> whether you did or not.<br> Men's all alike, married or single.<br> It's their game.<br> I happen to be smart enough<br> to play it their way.<br> You'll come to it.<br> Where've you been?<br> Just when I need you most of all,<br> you ain't around.<br> I ain't been no place, Miss Lou.<br> You ain't been no place,<br> you've just been lost.<br> Get my little friend here fixed up<br> with some new clothes.<br> Get these rags off her.<br> - What's your name, dear?<br> - Sally.<br> - Sally, what?<br> - Sally Glynn.<br> Always remember to smile.<br> You'll never have anything to worry about.<br> Forget about this guy.<br> See that you get a good one the next time.<br> Who'd want me after what I've done?<br> Listen, when women go wrong,<br> men go right after them.<br> You want to put more petticoats on her?<br> No, she's got enough on.<br> Wouldn't need any of them if they didn't stuff<br> this furniture with horsehair.<br> If you was to go out<br> and something were to happen...<br> I wouldn't want no policeman to catch me<br> without no petticoat.<br> No policeman? How about a nice fireman?<br> That's the spirit, sister.<br> - Lou, I'm just bringing the folks in.<br> - All right.<br> Such a gorgeous place, Gus.<br> I didn't think such a room existed<br> in this house.<br> Everything here imported special from Paris.<br> - Hello, Rita.<br> - Hello, Lou.<br> I didn't expect to see you so soon.<br> - You're here, too? How nice.<br> - Lou?<br> What's become of the girl<br> who caused the excitement downstairs?<br> She's inside. Pearl's fixing her up.<br> She'll be all right.<br> You gotta do something about people<br> using your joint for a morgue.<br> - What about this poor creature, Lou?<br> - Some guy done her wrong.<br> The story's so old<br> it should have been set to music long ago.<br> I would like to see this girl, Lou.<br> I think, perhaps,<br> I could do something for her.<br> That'll be great. I'll send her in.<br> - You look after her, Gus. I gotta dress.<br> - All right.<br> - I think she would be very useful to us.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> How charming. How lovely.<br> Come, sit over here with us.<br> What a sweet, innocent face.<br> Can't you do something for her, Rita?<br> Can you sing and dance, perhaps?<br> Not very well, I'm afraid.<br> - But you'd be willing to learn?<br> - Yes, I guess so.<br> Then, I think I can find you<br> a very nice position.<br> Have you heard, perhaps,<br> of the Barbary Coast?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> But it wouldn't make any difference.<br> Your people? Your parents?<br> I don't want them to know<br> anything about me.<br> I don't want them to know where I am.<br> You just leave everything to your friend, Rita.<br> There you are. Come with us now, little girl.<br> We'll take good care of you.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Lou, we're going to help this little girl.<br> All right, Gus. She's a nice kid.<br> - Are you busy?<br> - Yeah, I'm a little late getting dressed.<br> Come, Serge.<br> - See you later.<br> - All right, Lou.<br> Come up again, any time.<br> I shall. Then I hope you will be alone.<br> So do I.<br> Warm, dark, and handsome.<br> - Your bath is ready, Miss Lou.<br> - You take it. I'm indisposed.<br> Serge, come.<br> All right, Spider, just a minute. Here you are.<br> You go with Rita,<br> she'll take good care of you.<br> Sally, you come with me, dear.<br> I will take very good care of you.<br> Pearl.<br> - Pearl?<br> - I is coming.<br> Yeah, you is coming,<br> your head is bending low.<br> Now, get here before winter.<br> - Here I is.<br> - Here you is.<br> Eight Ball, what're you doing?<br> Working for me or sleeping for me?<br> I ain't sleeping so much that I don't see<br> what's going on around here.<br> What've you been seeing?<br> That fellow from the mission.<br> Mr... What's his name?<br> Y'all know what's his name, Miss Lou.<br> I'm surprised at you, with all<br> your experience, casting eyes on a preacher.<br> Now, Pearl, you know I've never been<br> interested in a man's job.<br> Besides, he ain't a preacher.<br> Anyhow, he ain't like the other men<br> you done made history of.<br> No, that's what makes him<br> kind of interesting.<br> Wouldn't hurt me any to have a new kind<br> of man added to my record, would it?<br> Goodness me, Miss Lou.<br> You ain't thinking of reforming, is you?<br> You know,<br> preachers don't give away no diamonds.<br> I told you he ain't a preacher,<br> he just runs the mission next door.<br> I hear he ain't gonna run that long.<br> I hear they're gonna take the mission<br> away from him.<br> Fella named Jacobson<br> that owns the building...<br> I hear they can't pay the rent.<br> Seems to me you've been hearing things.<br> - Who's that?<br> - Spider Kane.<br> In a minute, Spider.<br> - Miss Lou'll be here in a minute.<br> - Thanks, Pearl.<br> Come in, Spider, sit down.<br> What's on your mind?<br> I want to talk to you about something.<br> - Nothing serious, I hope.<br> - Not exactly, Lou.<br> Well, yeah, maybe in a way, it is.<br> Spill it. I ain't afraid. My conscience is clear.<br> Leastwise, I think it is.<br> What I've got to say<br> is about Chick Clark.<br> Chick Clark?<br> I'm wondering if you ain't sort of forgetting<br> about him.<br> I've gotta admit it's been a long time<br> since I've seen Chick...<br> but I ain't never completely forgot about him.<br> - He's been in a year now, Lou.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> You know how he took his rap, quiet like.<br> Same as we all would.<br> It was tough he got caught,<br> but it wasn't my fault.<br> I ain't the sentimental kind, Spider.<br> Sure, but remember,<br> you said you'd be, well...<br> waiting around for him whenever he gets out.<br> Gets out? That's gonna be a long time.<br> What I want to say is...<br> supposing he found out<br> you ain't exactly been waiting.<br> I gotta do something while I'm waiting,<br> don't I?<br> Chick wouldn't figure it that way.<br> Suppose he found out about Jordan?<br> - What are you trying to tell me?<br> - Go up and see him, Lou.<br> What for? And antagonise Gus?<br> If I start going up there,<br> Gus'll think I'm still caring for Chick.<br> Not that I don't like him a lot.<br> I ain't got no complaint.<br> - Chick was a good man. In his way.<br> - He's in love with you, Lou.<br> And being in the clink a year without the girl<br> what makes you feel that way...<br> ain't no picnic.<br> I wish he'd forget me,<br> but the guy is a memory expert.<br> Go up to pacify him, Lou.<br> Make him think everything is all right.<br> Chick is pretty bad when he wants to be.<br> You don't want him feeding you bullets.<br> I don't exactly want to be dodging around<br> in tin corsets.<br> How's about it us going up<br> to see him tomorrow?<br> Why tomorrow?<br> Me laundry will be back then.<br> - Make it Sunday. It'll be nice and quiet.<br> - That's fine, Lou.<br> It'll be a swell trip.<br> We can take the boat up the Hudson.<br> I'll take the train. Water and me don't agree.<br> All right.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Please don't tell them I'm here, Captain.<br> - Captain, will you help me?<br> - What's the matter, Pete?<br> There was a window broken<br> down at Flaherty's drug store.<br> - I didn't mean to do it.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Which way did he go?<br> - That's Doheney.<br> - Don't let him get me, Captain.<br> - Get up there and stay quiet.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Who?<br> Don't try to fool me. I know you're<br> always trying to help these dirty crooks.<br> Now where did he go?<br> Where did you put him?<br> - Who do you mean?<br> - Pete the Duke, you know who I mean.<br> You must be mistaken.<br> Pete's been helping me all afternoon.<br> - Who says so?<br> - I do.<br> Two against one, Doheney,<br> so flap your heels.<br> What's the matter here?<br> You're in again?<br> Listen, Jordan, I'm after Pete the Duke,<br> I saw him come in the door...<br> Just a minute, Doheney. I thought I told you<br> you weren't welcome here.<br> What's the use of stalling me?<br> I saw him come in the door...<br> Thanks.<br> Ain't having much luck, are you?<br> I'd have a great deal more<br> if Doheney and the others would cooperate.<br> Ain't none of them worth saving.<br> If you hang around them long enough,<br> you'll get that way yourself.<br> Thanks for the kind interest.<br> I always did like a man in a uniform.<br> That one fits you grand.<br> Why don't you come up sometime<br> and see me?<br> - I'm home every evening.<br> - Yeah, but I'm busy every evening.<br> Busy? Say, what are you trying to do,<br> insult me?<br> Why, no, not at all. I'm just busy, that's all.<br> You see, we're holding meetings<br> in Jacobson's hall every evening.<br> When you have a moment to spare, drop in.<br> You're more than welcome.<br> I heard you. But you ain't kidding me any.<br> You know, I met your kind before.<br> Why don't you come up sometime?<br> Well, I...<br> - Don't be afraid. I won't tell.<br> - But...<br> Come up. I'll tell your fortune.<br> You can be had.<br> Remember, Lou.<br> Chick's probably pretty sore.<br> I'll make him think he's on a vacation.<br> - Yeah, he'll listen to you.<br> - Who won't?<br> Once I get them, they're branded.<br> Hello, Shorty, what are you doing here?<br> - Five years.<br> - What for?<br> I forgot what me mother told me.<br> Should have tied a string around your finger.<br> - Hello, Lou.<br> - Bobo, I didn't expect to see you here.<br> If you hadn't turned me down<br> I'd have never landed in here.<br> Say, Lou, how about giving me<br> another chance when I get out?<br> - When do you get out?<br> - 15 years.<br> That's a date.<br> Hello, Lou.<br> Cherry sisters.<br> Lou, you gotta help me<br> get out of this.<br> - Who, me?<br> - You've gotta. I've been framed.<br> You got a lot of pull. You can get me out,<br> It's a frame, I tell you.<br> You're the right picture for it.<br> One of the fastest guys in the business,<br> but he's taking his time now.<br> Hello, Lou.<br> What is this? Old Home Week?<br> Chick.<br> Why didn't you come to see me sooner?<br> - 'Cause you were glad to get rid of me?<br> - Chick.<br> You know what I mean and you know me.<br> What am I in here for?<br> You know why I copped them stones?<br> Sure, and you know who's got them now.<br> You'd sell your heart and lungs<br> for a handful of diamonds.<br> And I'm doing a stretch with rats and bugs<br> so you can have them.<br> It's all right.<br> As long as you're on the level.<br> But if you ain't, I can find out.<br> Don't forget that. I can find out.<br> And I can get out.<br> If you've been double-crossing me,<br> you'll pay for it.<br> Every day, every minute<br> of this stretch, you're gonna pay for.<br> Don't talk like that, Chick. I've been working.<br> Working? Working who?<br> Singing at Gus Jordan's.<br> - Gus Jordan's?<br> - It ain't what you think.<br> You haven't been seeing<br> anything of Dan Flynn, have you?<br> No, why do you ask about him?<br> Nothing. Just got a score...<br> to settle up with him when I get out.<br> What I want to know is are you<br> playing me on the square or ain't you...<br> - because if you ain't...<br> - There'll be a death in my family?<br> - No.<br> - Is that it?<br> Then I'll be back in here again.<br> But you won't be coming around to see me.<br> What's the use of making<br> a lot of trouble for yourself, Chick?<br> If I can wait a year, you can wait a year.<br> You mean that you'll wait for me?<br> Why, that ain't nothing<br> when you got willpower like me.<br> - Time's up.<br> - Have a heart.<br> They ain't seen each other in a year.<br> Give them time.<br> What for? Ready?<br> Goodbye, Chick.<br> It's been good to see you again.<br> I can't let you go, Lou.<br> I hate to leave you.<br> Don't worry. I'll be true to you.<br> I trust you. I trust you because I love you.<br> You're mine.<br> I'm telling you again,<br> if you ever double-cross me...<br> if you ever let another man<br> come between us...<br> I'll kill you.<br> Goodbye, Chick.<br> I'll remember to be good for you.<br> I can't wait.<br> I wonder what Chick's got<br> against Dan Flynn?<br> I ain't never told you, Lou...<br> but Flynn is the main guy<br> what helped send Chick up here.<br> I ain't never had no use<br> for that mug ever since.<br> - So Flynn did that?<br> - Yeah.<br> Darling, I am growing old<br> Silver threads<br> among the gold<br> Shine upon my brow today<br> Life is fading fast away<br> Not in your beer, dearie. Not in your beer.<br> But, my darling<br> you will always be<br> Always young and fair<br> to me<br> Yes, my darling<br> you will be<br> Always young and fair<br> to me<br> Darling, I am growing old<br> growing old<br> Silver threads<br> among the gold<br> Shine upon my brow today<br> Life is fading<br> fast away<br> - Bravo.<br> - You took long enough.<br> - I couldn't help it.<br> Jacobson wasn't at the mission,<br> so I had to go to the hock shop.<br> - What about it?<br> - He'll be right over.<br> - Was that Cummings guy there?<br> - I didn't see him.<br> - Say, Lou, you falling for that bloke?<br> - It ain't nothing serious...<br> there was something<br> just wonderful about him.<br> That's the way it always starts.<br> He wouldn't look at me.<br> Only out of curiosity. He's different.<br> You've got it bad.<br> Say, Lou, you sent for a guy<br> named lke Jacobson?<br> Yeah, send him in.<br> I want to see this guy alone, Frances.<br> - All right, then.<br> - Hello, Lou.<br> - Hello, Jacobson.<br> What can I do for you?<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thanks.<br> I hear the rescue mission<br> rents your building.<br> Rents, that's right.<br> But they ain't got no money.<br> - So, how can I keep them there?<br> - You ain't gonna put them out?<br> Put them out, me? No.<br> - I'll just tell them they'll have to move.<br> - But Mr. Cummings is in charge.<br> Yes. Nice, smartish-looking fellow.<br> Why did you send for me, Lou?<br> You want me to buy<br> some of your famous diamonds or...<br> No. What do you want for that building?<br> You mean, how much if I'm selling,<br> or how much if I'm paying taxes?<br> I mean how much for cash?<br> Now stop multiplying.<br> I don't want to buy the Bowery.<br> I was going to ask $25,000 for that building.<br> My own brother couldn't buy it for $20,000.<br> - But for you, I'll make it $15,000.<br> - Well, I'll give you $12,000.<br> Oy, gevalt!<br> - $12,000. Never.<br> - All right.<br> - All right.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> Wait. Is that all cash?<br> No mortgage goes with it?<br> Here's your $12,000.<br> How do I know it is?<br> Because I say so. You never heard of me<br> cheating anyone, did you?<br> No. Not about money.<br> Now, listen, that sounds like a slam.<br> But coming from you, I'll let it pass.<br> Handle them with care.<br> They're only my heart.<br> And what a heart you've got, Miss Lou.<br> I'll tell you what I want you to do.<br> Come and make up the papers.<br> And make it appear like the mission<br> bought the building themselves.<br> - I don't want to be mixed up in it.<br> - We want Lou!<br> - Lou.<br> Hurry up, the place is jammed<br> with all the society folks.<br> I hope they tuned that piano.<br> Our Lady Lou is here<br> Ever since Miss Susan Johnson<br> She lost her jockey, Lee<br> There's been much excitement<br> and more to be<br> You can hear her moaning from early morn<br> I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone<br> I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone<br> If he was here he'd win the race<br> If not first he'd get a place<br> I never saw that jockey<br> trailing anyone before<br> I'm losing all my money<br> that's why I'm blue<br> If that boy was here<br> he'd sure know what to do<br> I'd put all my junk in pawn<br> To bet on any horse that jockey's on<br> I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone<br> I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone<br> He went and put my brand new bunch<br> in pawn<br> I see him coming round that turn<br> What a trail that man can burn<br> He's gotta win<br> because my dough is on the nose<br> Just watch my jockey easy ride in style<br> He'll hit that home stretch winner by a mile<br> I want him to win this spree<br> And keep on going till he comes to me<br> I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone<br> I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone<br> - You were great, Lou.<br> I'd like to have a word with you<br> when it's convenient.<br> I've been saving a little time for you.<br> Come up in a few minutes.<br> What are you doing here, Flynn?<br> - Just getting used to the place.<br> - Yeah?<br> - You're thinking about moving in?<br> - Yeah, I thought I might.<br> - When?<br> - When Gus moves out.<br> - Flynn, you're an optimist.<br> - No.<br> You may as well know it.<br> Gus is in the hole. And you'd be, too,<br> if it wasn't for me.<br> So, you're gonna protect me? From what?<br> There's a new dick in town called the Hawk.<br> He's been tipped off to Gus,<br> and he's got the goods on him.<br> Gus ain't done anything.<br> What's he got on him?<br> Don't be so innocent, Lou.<br> You're talking to a man who knows you...<br> and is willing to protect you<br> if you play along with him.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> You don't know anything<br> about that Sally girl?<br> What Sally?<br> The one you roped in<br> and turned over to Gus.<br> Why, he only got the poor kid a job.<br> Depends on what kind of a job.<br> That's where Gus put his foot in it.<br> Where do you think he gets the money<br> to buy you them rocks?<br> From this place here? Don't be a fool.<br> If Gus goes up the river,<br> you'll go along with him.<br> I'm tipping you off privately.<br> What are you trying to do, scare me, Dan?<br> When I need protection, I'll write you a letter.<br> That ain't no way to talk to me, Lou.<br> You said you liked me once.<br> When I said I was crazy about you,<br> I didn't say how crazy.<br> I never gave up and I never will.<br> You can't expect to go around<br> getting men all on fire...<br> and think they're gonna forget all about it.<br> Now, Gus has had you long enough.<br> He's going away.<br> I'll see about that.<br> And you're coming to me or nobody else.<br> You love me that much<br> that you'd frame Gus to get me?<br> To get you I'd even<br> frame my own mother.<br> And I believe you.<br> I'm beginning to understand you, Flynn.<br> Tell me.<br> Who is this here guy they call the Hawk?<br> He's the slickest bird in the business.<br> Even the men from headquarters<br> wouldn't know him if they fell over him.<br> You know, I never did appreciate you before.<br> But I do, now.<br> - You mean that, Lou?<br> - Why, of course I do.<br> I'll see about that little matter another time.<br> - All right.<br> - Lou, it looks like Chick's done it.<br> - Done what?<br> I ain't sure, but word's around he broke jail.<br> - Made a getaway?<br> - I'm just telling you. I'll be standing by.<br> Thanks, Spider. Keep your eyes open<br> and don't tell anyone.<br> I won't, Lou.<br> Come in.<br> I came to inquire about Sally Glynn.<br> I'm told she came here<br> after she left the mission that day.<br> - Where is she?<br> - How should I know?<br> You know where she is. I want you to tell me.<br> So you've come to me<br> to find another woman.<br> I don't know and I wouldn't tell you if I did.<br> You see, her father's over at the mission<br> looking for her.<br> - That's the only reason you want to know?<br> - Yeah.<br> Gus and his friends got her a job.<br> You don't know where?<br> No. I got other things to think about.<br> Would you give me your word<br> that you know nothing more?<br> - Would you believe me if I did?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - That's all I know.<br> - I'm glad to hear that.<br> Say it like you mean it.<br> I do. I'm anxious not to see you<br> mixed up in it.<br> But I guess I'm taking your time.<br> What do you suppose my time's for?<br> Sit down.<br> That's it, loosen up.<br> Unbend. You'll feel better.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - No, thanks. I don't smoke.<br> Yes, I guess smoking is gonna make a man<br> look effeminate before long.<br> So, all this is your famous collection?<br> No. This is just my summer jewellery.<br> You ought to see my winter stuff.<br> I see.<br> It was a tossup whether I'd go in<br> for diamonds or sing in the choir.<br> The choir lost.<br> They're wonderful.<br> But they always seem so cold to me.<br> They have no warmth, no soul.<br> I'm sorry you think more of your diamonds<br> than you do of your soul.<br> I'm sorry you think more of my soul<br> than you do of my diamonds.<br> Maybe I ain't got no soul.<br> Yes, you have,<br> but you keep it hidden under a mask.<br> You'll wake up and find it some time.<br> Haven't you met a man<br> that could make you happy?<br> Sure, lots of times.<br> You can't go out in this.<br> I gotta be getting back to the mission.<br> Sally's father is waiting for me.<br> That ought to be interesting.<br> Yeah, but it's one of the things<br> I have to do.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Come up again. Any time.<br> Thanks, I will.<br> It won't be long now.<br> Now, this is all we have<br> on hand at present.<br> One of the plates got busted<br> and sort of held us up.<br> These are beautiful, Gus.<br> One way to get rich is to make<br> one's own money, isn't it, Jordan?<br> Now, you have your instructions.<br> I won't say anything more.<br> You know what to do.<br> - Get rid of them quickly but safely.<br> - Not a word, Gus.<br> They say money talks,<br> but this can only whisper.<br> Stow these on you.<br> I'll take care of the rest.<br> - Soon we will be very rich, eh?<br> - I hope so.<br> - I need money.<br> - Don't we all?<br> One thing more...<br> - Who's there?<br> - Doheney.<br> - Just a minute, Doheney.<br> Come in, Doheney.<br> - What's up?<br> - Excuse me for butting in, Mr. Jordan...<br> - but have you seen anyone around here?<br> - No. Who?<br> - Chick Clark.<br> - Chick Clark?<br> - You'll find him up the river.<br> - He made a getaway. I thought you knew.<br> Collins here says he spotted him out back.<br> I'm sure it was him.<br> He was headed this way.<br> What would he come here for?<br> No telling, sir.<br> Maybe looking for trouble.<br> Better take a look. Excuse us, will you?<br> On life's stormy path,<br> ill-advised<br> Do not scorn her with words<br> fierce and bitter<br> Do not laugh<br> at her shame and downfall<br> For a moment, just stop<br> and consider<br> Wait a minute.<br> that a man was the cause<br> Sir, he might have gone that...<br> of it all<br> You can go home now, Pearl.<br> I won't need you anymore.<br> - You sure you won't, Miss Lou?<br> - No, you can go.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Just a minute.<br> - Chick, what do you want?<br> - I want you to pack up and come with me.<br> You don't suppose I'd be fool enough<br> to go anyplace with you.<br> Listen. I had to croak a guard to get out.<br> I'm here, now you're going with me.<br> I ain't going, Chick, I'm staying here.<br> - Don't you love me anymore?<br> - Anymore?<br> You mean to say you never loved me?<br> Why, you...<br> What? All I gotta do is call Gus,<br> and your trip will be back up the river.<br> - You'll never live to see me go.<br> - None of them cheap threats.<br> You ought to know me better.<br> I tell you, Chick, you're through. Get out.<br> You've got a nerve to stand there<br> and tell me to get out.<br> Me jumping freights<br> and crawling through the mud to get to you.<br> - Why, you...<br> - Chick!<br> I can't. I can't do it.<br> God, I can't.<br> Don't you know what I feel for you?<br> Ain't you got a heart left in you for me?<br> I gotta have you.<br> Chick, I never knew anything like that.<br> Just a minute.<br> I'll meet you tonight, at Callahan's.<br> Right after my turn.<br> - You'll come to me?<br> - I swear.<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> Thought it was Gus.<br> I could not stay away.<br> I was kind of expecting that.<br> - Hello, Rita.<br> - Hello, Flynn.<br> - Looking for your assistant?<br> - Yes.<br> Last time I saw him, he was headed that way.<br> - So...<br> - That's her. She's the one.<br> She's the woman that done it.<br> That woman there.<br> - Sit down.<br> - That was the one I told you about...<br> She can't get away<br> with anything like that again...<br> Let me alone! That woman...<br> - Is she talking about you, Rita?<br> - Me?<br> I never saw the woman before.<br> I've never been so insulted in all my life.<br> She must be mad, that woman.<br> Now, I'll talk to her.<br> I bring you a gift.<br> Diamonds. I know you love them so.<br> Ain't it grand.<br> See, they make your eyes sparkle,<br> and your teeth gleam like pearls.<br> You are beautiful. I love you so.<br> The men of my country go wild<br> about women with yellow hair.<br> I'm glad you told me.<br> I want to keep straight on my geography.<br> I love you. You were made for love.<br> And for love only should you care.<br> And now, surely,<br> you have enough diamonds.<br> Diamonds is my career.<br> I swear I shall make you happy.<br> I shall die to make you happy.<br> But you wouldn't be much use to me dead.<br> So, this is where I find you.<br> - Hello, Rita.<br> - Don't you "hello" me.<br> So, the minute my back is turned,<br> I find you making love to another woman.<br> What did you expect? A boy<br> with a gift like that should be working at it.<br> What have you to say for yourself?<br> I have nothing to say.<br> You saw. What can I say?<br> How dare you so insult me when I gave you<br> the very clothes on your back.<br> - He's gotta have more than clothes.<br> - I'll attend to you later.<br> Have you no apology? Are you not sorry?<br> Do you not wish me to forgive you?<br> - I love you, I swear it.<br> - You love her?<br> She loves only money and diamonds.<br> And let me tell you more about her. She...<br> Just a minute. You get out of here<br> and leave her to me.<br> My pin! What do you mean by taking my pin?<br> - I didn't take your pin, he gave it to me.<br> - I want it back, right now.<br> You try and get it.<br> I wouldn't give you<br> this here thing now for spite.<br> If you asked me for it the right way,<br> you could have had it.<br> I get all the rocks I want...<br> but I'll keep this here thing now<br> to remember you by.<br> You're so very clever, Lou. So wise.<br> And so very smart.<br> But in my country,<br> we know how to deal with you wise ones.<br> - Sneaky, underhanded...<br> - I'll kill you, you hear me?<br> - Open that hand. Give me that knife.<br> - You think you're clever?<br> - Give me that knife.<br> Rita.<br> Here. I don't want your pin.<br> Lou?<br> He must've come over that shed.<br> Lou, did you see anyone<br> out on the shed?<br> No.<br> No, there's nobody there.<br> Sorry to have bothered you.<br> All right, Doheney.<br> I want to have a little<br> talk with you afterwards, Lou.<br> - Better hurry, they're waiting for you.<br> - I'll be right down.<br> I'm just doing a job I never did before.<br> Spider.<br> - Lou, I found...<br> - Don't bother me.<br> - Are you nervous, Lou?<br> - No.<br> - You are nervous, ain't you, Lou?<br> - No, I ain't nervous.<br> 'Cause if you're nervous I got...<br> I ain't nervous,<br> but if you keep asking me, I will be.<br> A guy what takes his time<br> I'll go for any time<br> I'm a fast-moving girl<br> That likes them slow<br> Got no use for fancy driving<br> Wanna see a guy arrive a little low<br> There isn't any fun<br> In getting something done<br> If you're rushed<br> when you have to make the grade<br> I can spot an amateur<br> appreciate a connoisseur<br> at his trade<br> Who would qualify, no alibi<br> to be the guy<br> what takes his time<br> Since I've been in office,<br> I've never heard anything so appalling.<br> Every word of it is true.<br> - Is that all?<br> - Yes, sir, that's all.<br> What this young lady says<br> is a serious accusation...<br> and means the end of that gang,<br> and coincides with Dan Flynn's report.<br> - Let me hear the next witness.<br> - That's all, Miss.<br> Come, Sally.<br> Now, Sally, tell the District Attorney<br> exactly what you told me.<br> Lou, what did Cummings want?<br> I seen him go upstairs to your room.<br> He wanted to know about that Sally girl<br> you sent to the coast.<br> He did? Wonder what for.<br> The father was over at the mission<br> and wanted them to find her.<br> All I told him was that you got her a job.<br> I'm sorry I ever bothered with that girl.<br> Why are you so funny-acting, Gus?<br> Funny-acting? What do you mean?<br> You're acting kind of funny.<br> Have I done anything you don't like?<br> No. Not exactly.<br> I tell you, Lou. I don't like this bird Stanieff<br> always hanging around you.<br> He's too sleek, too slippery.<br> Too polite to suit me.<br> So that's what's biting you.<br> Why, he don't mean nothing to me.<br> He's Rita's friend.<br> I wanted to make him feel at home.<br> Yeah? All right.<br> I guess I'm a jealous old fool.<br> They are valuable, ain't they, Gus?<br> Worth pretty nearly half a million.<br> Gonna get you a lot more of them soon.<br> He said they had no soul.<br> Who said?<br> That guy, Cummings.<br> So, you met a man who wouldn't fall for you?<br> Who wants him to fall?<br> Why, he'd be the kind<br> a woman'd have to marry to get rid of.<br> That sounds more like Dan Flynn.<br> You ain't heard anything about this copper<br> they call the Hawk, have you?<br> Just talk, why?<br> Flynn says he's spotting the place<br> day and night.<br> Flynn said that? What does he know?<br> I hope you ain't sending them girls<br> to the coast...<br> to become classy dips and burglars,<br> like Flynn thinks.<br> He can't knife me and get away with it.<br> Lou, I wanted to tell you...<br> - You do that, Spider?<br> - What?<br> Something I had to do,<br> and didn't have the time to do it...<br> and Spider did it for me.<br> Boss, there's a guy out here named McNeil,<br> he wants to cash a cheque.<br> McNeil? I don't know him.<br> By the way, have you seen Rita around?<br> Rita? Why, no.<br> I guess she'll come in later.<br> - I want to thank you Spider. It was great.<br> - I know.<br> - Lou, I'd do anything for you...<br> - I went through enough tonight.<br> - I gotta tell you...<br> - I gotta do my number.<br> Chick Clark is in the alley.<br> - Chick Clark?<br> - Yeah.<br> What do you want me to do with him, Lou?<br> Take him up the back way to my room.<br> I don't want the cops to get him.<br> - All right, Lou.<br> - I'll figure something out later.<br> All right, Lou.<br> Frankie and Johnny<br> were sweethearts<br> Oh, how they could love<br> Swore they'd be true to each other<br> True as the stars up above<br> He was her man<br> And he was doing her wrong<br> Frankie went down to the corner<br> To get a bucket of beer<br> Said to the man called the bartender<br> Have you seen my Johnny here?<br> He's my man<br> And he's doing me wrong<br> Ain't gonna tell you no stories<br> Ain't gonna tell you no lies<br> Saw your man Johnny leave<br> about an hour ago<br> With that girl named Nellie Bly<br> He's your man and he's doing you wrong<br> Frankie went round to that hot spot<br> Brought along a great big.44<br> She went inside and then she smiled<br> At Johnny on the floor<br> He was her man<br> And he was doing...<br> Stay back, you hear?<br> I'll plug the first one that moves.<br> Come on, men.<br> Come on, Lou. We've got to get out of here.<br> No time to talk now, come on.<br> - You get off me!<br> - Go on!<br> Through the tunnel.<br> Wait a minute.<br> - You.<br> - Why, what'd you...<br> Hold it!<br> I've waited a long time for this moment,<br> Jordan, and now I got you good.<br> - I am boss of this district.<br> - You're smart, but not smart enough.<br> That's the trouble with ward heelers like you.<br> Get a little political power,<br> you think you're king.<br> With bribes, petty favours<br> you think you're above the law.<br> It's not the mission talking now,<br> it's the U.S. Government.<br> - So, you're the Hawk.<br> - Yeah, that's what they call me.<br> Making and passing counterfeit money<br> is a federal offence.<br> Yeah, you and your crowd are due<br> for about 20 years in Atlanta.<br> Go on, boys, take him out of here.<br> - I thought something...<br> - Come on.<br> - Lay off me.<br> - Come on.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Say, what's going to happen to her?<br> Never mind, she'll be well taken care of.<br> Come on.<br> You, the Hawk.<br> A night bird working in the dark.<br> Stealing the confidence of people.<br> - The lowest kind of a thief.<br> - I'm sorry you think so.<br> Chief, I've got that other fellow out here,<br> you wanna look at him?<br> Come here.<br> - Is that the man?<br> - Yes, that's the man.<br> Thank you.<br> - Take him to headquarters.<br> - Come on.<br> Take care of the young lady till I get back.<br> - Where is she?<br> - Went out that way, sir.<br> Why did you let her?<br> - You double-crossed me.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You planted me up here...<br> - You got me wrong.<br> ...and sent that rat, Flynn, to get me,<br> but I got him first.<br> - Now I'm gonna get you.<br> - Wait.<br> Say your prayers, if you know any.<br> I'll meet you in...<br> Come on, get him out of here.<br> Those absolutely necessary?<br> You know, I wasn't born with them.<br> No, a lot of men would have been safer<br> if you had.<br> I don't know, hands ain't everything.<br> All right. Come on.<br> My wrap.<br> If you wanna help me, pick up my train.<br> - Come on, get back.<br> - Keep back.<br> Here she comes now.<br> Get back. Come on.<br> Sure, they got me, but they got you, too.<br> Chief, we got them all.<br> Yeah, all but the brass band.<br> Wait a minute, you forgot me.<br> Break it up, come on.<br> Clear out. Move along.<br> I think I'd have liked the wagon better.<br> I suppose you'd rather have the company<br> of your friends, such as they are.<br> You ain't exactly a pal.<br> Surely you don't mind my holding your hand.<br> It ain't heavy. I can hold it myself.<br> This is a dirty trick. I could get real sore.<br> If I didn't have a lot of self-control.<br> So have I, but I'm beginning to lose it.<br> You know, you remind me<br> of a glittering palace of ice.<br> I ain't ice.<br> I didn't say you were.<br> But your diamonds are all going<br> to the storehouse.<br> You said I had a soul.<br> I looked for it, but I didn't find it.<br> - You will.<br> - Where, in jail?<br> - No, that's not the place for you.<br> - You got me, ain't you?<br> Yeah, I got you. You're my prisoner.<br> And I'm gonna be your jailor for a long time.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> And you can start doing that stretch<br> right now.<br> Where did you get that...<br> dark and handsome?<br> You bad girl.<br> You'll find out.<br>
