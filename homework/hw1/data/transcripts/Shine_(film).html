                        I did. I did.<br> I--I thought I was a cat.<br> Well, kind of, kind of.<br> I identified with cats.<br> Well, I kind of did.<br> I wonder why that was?<br> They're never sure when<br> you try to stroke them,<br> is that right?<br> So maybe I was a sad cat.<br> Was I a sad cat?<br> Because I wonder--<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br> I wonder about cats.<br> Truly, I did. I did. I did.<br> 'Cause I was a fuddy-duddy.<br> Fuddy-duddy.<br> I kissed them all.<br> Kissed them.<br> I will always kiss cats.<br> If a cat would let me kiss it,<br> I'd kiss it.<br> You know, if I see<br> a cat on the fence,<br> I'll kiss it. Always.<br> Always.<br> I would, didn't I?<br> Life's a perpetual risk,<br> isn't it?<br> That's right.<br> I think it is.<br> Because, the point is,<br> I was different in those days.<br> I was. I was.<br> And I've--I've got to be<br> different again.<br> So, can the leopard<br> change its spots?<br> I mean, who knows?<br> It's a blood sport.<br> I think it's a blood sport.<br> It's true.<br> It seems to be true.<br> Or is it a blank?<br> Bit of a Scrabble.<br> You've got to put<br> all the pieces together,<br> see if you can make a word.<br> That's funny.<br> That's funny. That's funny.<br> It's a mystery.<br> It's a mystery.<br> Bye!<br> Take care.<br> Bye-bye.<br> We're closed!<br> What's the problem, mate?<br> Sorry, sorry,<br> sorry, sorry, mate.<br> I'm the problem.<br> I think I'm the problem.<br> Such a problem!<br> And wet!<br> But it's not an ideal world.<br> Is it an ideal world?<br> We just have to make<br> the most of it.<br> This is the way we find it,<br> isn't it? Yeah, yeah.<br> It's more ideal than it was,<br> because, I mean,<br> you know, I mean,<br> we're privileged.<br> We're privileged, aren't we?<br> Because not long ago,<br> people would be burnt to<br> a steak, wouldn't they, Moby?<br> Moby, yeah!<br> No, no. It's Tony.<br> Who are you?<br> Tony, Tony, Tony.<br> Not Moby. Tony, Tony.<br> Who am I, Tony?<br> Who knows, Tony? I don't know.<br> So, ah!<br> I'm David. I'm David, Tony.<br> How does it sound?<br> Hi, David.<br> How can Sylvia help?<br> Sylvia. Is it Sylvia?<br> Sylvia! Hi, Sylvia!<br> Pleased to meet you,<br> Sylvia! Oh!<br> Schubert.<br> Schubert, wasn't it?<br> He said, "Who is Sylvia?<br> What is she?"<br> What--what can we<br> do for you, David?<br> Do for me? Do for me?<br> What? Oh, l--oh, l--<br> I got to stop talking.<br> It's a problem, isn't it?<br> No, no, no.<br> It's all right.<br> Just tell Sylvia<br> why you're here.<br> Oh, well, uh,<br> it's a mystery--<br> Are you lost?<br> Am I lost?<br> Perhaps that's it.<br> Perhaps I'm lost.<br> How does that sound?<br> How does that sound?<br> Is that<br> your piano, Sylvia?<br> Beautiful Sylvia.<br> lsn't Sylvia beautiful, Toby?<br> Not Toby.<br> Tony. Tony. Tony.<br> You're beautiful, too, Tony.<br> Perhaps I could play it.<br> Could I play it?<br> Could I play it?<br> You say. You say.<br> Like hell, baby.<br> Go on.<br> Shut up, Sam.<br> Hell, baby.<br> Whoa, whoa! The devil.<br> Diablerie. Whoa, Sam...<br> David...<br> Get out of here!<br> Go on!<br> Sylvia, Sylvia,<br> Sylvia, Sylvia...<br> You just tell us who you are<br> and where you live.<br> Could l--could I play?<br> Live--live--live, Sylvia.<br> Live and let live.<br> That's very important, isn't it?<br> Molto, molto.<br> But then again,<br> it's a lifelong struggle,<br> isn't it, Sylvia?<br> Tony, Tony, Tony.<br> Sylvia. To--to survive.<br> To live. To survive.<br> To survive undamaged...<br> and not to destroy any living,<br> breathing creature.<br> I mean, the point is,<br> if you do something wrong,<br> you're going to be punished<br> for the rest of your life.<br> So I think it's<br> a lifelong struggle.<br> Is it a lifelong struggle?<br> Yeah.<br> Whatever you do, I think<br> it's a struggle, a struggle,<br> a struggle to keep<br> your head above water...<br> and not get it chopped off.<br> I'm not disappointing you, am I,<br> Sylvia? Tony?<br> Tony, Sylvia, Sam, yes, Sam!<br> Hello, Sam!<br> Get off!<br> Helfgott.<br> What a name!<br> Sorry, Sylvia.<br> I sound like a donkey.<br> Helfgott.<br> "With the help of God."<br> That's what it means.<br> You see, Daddy's daddy<br> was religious.<br> Very religious.<br> Ve-very strict.<br> And a bit of a meanie.<br> But he got exterminated,<br> didn't he?<br> So God didn't help him.<br> That's not very funny.<br> It's very sad really.<br> I'm callous, Daddy said.<br> Callous.<br> And a bit of a meanie.<br> Sorry, Sylvia,<br> I'm not damaging you.<br> I mustn't damage Sylvia.<br> The point is, the point is,<br> perhaps I haven't got a soul.<br> What makes you say that?<br> Daddy said there's<br> no such thing as a soul.<br> Oh, that's ridiculous.<br> Ridiculous. You're right.<br> I am ridiculous.<br> And callous, Daddy said.<br> Callous. Callous.<br> Ridiculous and callous.<br> Because it was a tragedy.<br> A tragedy.<br> A ri-ridiculous tragedy.<br> I'm going to win.<br> I'm going to win.<br> I'm going to win!<br> I'm going to win!<br> David's going to play<br> the piano for us.<br> Aren't you, David?<br> Yes.<br> What are you going to play?<br> What are you going to play?<br> Excuse me.<br> Chopin.<br> The Polonaise.<br> This is crazy.<br> It's the piano...<br> the piano.<br> It's a disgrace.<br> This kid's good.<br> He's great.<br> He is my son.<br> My son.<br> Here they come.<br> Did he win or lose?<br> Margaret!<br> He lost.<br> Now we'll cop it.<br> It's your turn.<br> It's your turn, Daddy.<br> Let me see.<br> Let me see.<br> Let, uh, let me see.<br> You're losing.<br> You're losing.<br> You're losing.<br> David, always win.<br> Always...<br> win.<br> You know, when l--<br> when I was a boy your age,<br> I bought a violin,<br> a beautiful violin.<br> And I saved for this violin.<br> And you know<br> what happened to it?<br> Yes...<br> he smashed it.<br> Yeah...<br> he smashed it.<br> David,<br> you're a very lucky boy.<br> My father never let me<br> have music.<br> I know.<br> A very lucky boy.<br> Say it.<br> I'm a very lucky boy.<br> Very...lucky.<br> Now shall I play for you?<br> No. Pick up those pieces.<br> Bet I could have won.<br> You'd have been<br> too scared.<br> Listen.<br> Have a listen.<br> Margaret!<br> I told you,<br> tell your friends not to come.<br> Hello.<br> Daddy, there's<br> somebody to see you!<br> Hello.<br> I hope I'm not<br> interrupting.<br> Uh, Ben Rosen.<br> I was one of the judges.<br> Yes?<br> You left before all the prizes<br> were announced.<br> You were very good<br> this afternoon, David.<br> Thank you.<br> He can play better.<br> Well, maybe he was<br> a little too good.<br> Some people don't like that.<br> We, uh, we gave him a special<br> prize for his courage.<br> Difficult piece<br> you chose, David.<br> Daddy chose it.<br> Well, even great pianists<br> think twice...<br> before tackling<br> the Polonaise.<br> A prize for losing.<br> I wouldn't call him<br> a loser.<br> They all...<br> they all play.<br> Well, I'm quite sure...<br> David could win<br> lots of competitions...<br> with the right tuition.<br> My card.<br> I teach him.<br> Yeah. You've obviously<br> done very well.<br> Yeah.<br> No one taught me.<br> No music teachers,<br> Mr. Rosen.<br> No, of course.<br> It's just, uh...<br> it's just a few bad habits...<br> can sometimes mean the<br> difference between winning...<br> or losing.<br> Well, perhaps you'd, uh, you'd<br> like to think about it, hmm?<br> It's Rachmaninoff.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Yeah.<br> You taught yourself?<br> From the record.<br> Ah, yeah.<br> It's...it's very difficult.<br> It's very difficult.<br> It's...<br> it's the hardest piece<br> in the world, you know?<br> Will you teach me?<br> You know...<br> one day you will play it.<br> You will make me<br> very proud...<br> very proud,<br> won't you, David?<br> Yes.<br> And, uh...<br> next time...<br> What are we going to do?<br> We're going to win?<br> We're going to win,<br> yes.<br> So...<br> good night.<br> Good night, Daddy.<br> Come.<br> Come, come, come.<br> Don't touch.<br> Don't touch.<br> Yes?<br> Mr. Rosen, I have decided<br> I would like...<br> you teach David...<br> this.<br> Rachmaninoff?<br> Don't be ridiculous.<br> But he can play it<br> already.<br> He's just a boy.<br> How can he express<br> that sort of passion?<br> You are a passionate man,<br> Mr. Rosen.<br> You will teach him, no?<br> No.<br> I will teach him<br> what I think is best.<br> Rachmaninoff is best.<br> But...<br> You're his teacher.<br> I'll let you decide.<br> Thank you.<br> We'll start with Mozart.<br> Mr. Rosen.<br> I can't afford to pay.<br> Come on, David.<br> Sylvia's getting wet.<br> Oh, sorry, Sylvia.
