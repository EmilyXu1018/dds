Saturday's<br> Casey's birthday party.<br> The plan was to swim.<br> Howard's nephew's a lifeguard.<br> We were gonna pay him to watch the kids.<br> But... -<br> I don't know now.<br> Maybe you should drain the pool,<br> change the water.<br> Won't the "methalanon"<br> contaminate the water?<br> They sprayed again last night.<br> It's safe, Mrs. Finnigan.<br> It's only toxic for a few hours.<br> The water actually dilutes it,<br> so water's probably the safest place to be.<br> So irresponsible. Casey has allergies.<br> The slightest thing sets him off.<br> I wouldn't worry about it,<br> Mrs. Finnigan.<br> Well... why don't you<br> come again Saturday?<br> When's your next regular day?<br> Tuesday.<br> l-l-I can't make it Saturday.<br> - Hi.<br> - But really, I wouldn't worry about it.<br> I was wondering if your guy<br> could treat my pool. Can you?<br> Can I what?<br> Whatever you put in it<br> to kill the bug spray.<br> I'll pay you.<br> I'm afraid to go in.<br> - I only have time to take care of<br> my regular customers, ma'am. I'm sorry.<br> - Hey, Jerry, can I help with the pool today?<br> - Casey, get back in the house.<br> It's still dangerous out here.<br> - Well, maybe I'll become a regular customer.<br> - Get ready for school.<br> - Have you seen my wallet?<br> - Oh. It's next to the phone.<br> - What's it doing there?<br> Oh, I was ordering something<br> from this catalog.<br> - Right.<br> - Will you at least come over and look at it?<br> - Not now, ma'am!<br> I... - You know, I might be able<br> to swing back by in a couple of hours.<br> I'm late. We'll talk about<br> your bearded iris tonight.<br> Hey, Jer! How goes the war?<br> Bad guys are winning, sir.<br> Yeah, well, thank you very much.<br> Now, see, these bugs... -<br> This Humphrey or this Royal Coachman... -<br> - Here you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> "Doreen."<br> Is that your name? Doreen?<br> - That's it.<br> - Hey, Gordon, isn't that your first wife's name?<br> - Darlene.<br> - Oh.<br> - Darlene.<br> - Are you sure?<br> No.<br> - So, where we going, anyway, guys?<br> - An hour outside of Bakersfield.<br> - Then we're gonna walk.<br> - How far?<br> Four or five hours.<br> There's nobody there.<br> - You say it's good, right?<br> - Yeah. Is the fishing good?<br> - It's gorgeous.<br> - Oh, good.<br> You've never seen anything like it.<br> They want to be caught.<br> They're desperate to be caught.<br> What's that for?<br> I thought I might have to<br> examine you later on.<br> Where'd you get it?<br> Some doctor left it in my web.<br> - Better take it to the lost and found.<br> - Yeah.<br> What's the menu like, babe?<br> The Greek's watching.<br> Don't order anything you can't pay for.<br> Daddy's home!<br> - Pow! Pow! Pow!<br> - Daddy, you gonna take us to the park today?<br> Off me! Off me!<br> - Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!<br> - Quiet!<br> Cut it out.<br> Pow! Pow!<br> Quiet! Quiet!<br> Get in the house.<br> - Did you do this?<br> - No. The dog did!<br> Mommy, Mommy, Daddy's home!<br> Daddy's home!<br> That's really exciting, sweetheart.<br> Please finish eating.<br> - Bang! Bang! I saw Dada!<br> - Please don't point that gun at me.<br> Who gave the dog my belt?<br> This is completely destroyed.<br> Completely ruined. It's a piece of trash.<br> It's a $35 belt.<br> Shut up!<br> - That dog has got to go.<br> - Wanna talk about where you were last night?<br> No, I don't.<br> Not in front of the kids, I don't.<br> I don't want them to hear about all the<br> "ain-pay"and "isery-may" I saw last night.<br> If you would like to hear<br> about kids on C-R-A-C-K...<br> you can come in the other room.<br> Whose crack<br> are we talking about, Gene?<br> I got a list here.<br> Um, I canceled the Times.<br> I stopped the mail.<br> Just check up on the fish... -<br> Harriet! Enough about the fish.<br> Let's go.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> - Which one takes the, um, goldfish?<br> These are the lionfish,<br> and these are the goldfish.<br> - Come on. I don't wanna miss that plane.<br> - Okay.<br> just feed the other fish<br> regular food.<br> - Hey, sorry. You guys are running late, huh?<br> - Yeah. She keeps running her mouth.<br> Uh-huh.<br> You need a hand with those?<br> I gotta go. Jim's gonna have a fit,<br> and I gotta make sure I have the tickets.<br> - Have a good time in Memphis.<br> - Thank you.

Joe, now!<br> - Baby... -<br> - How long you gonna stay on that phone, Lois?<br> - Sit down. Look at the cards.<br> - Say, "Please, mistress."<br> - Sit down.<br> - I didn't tell you to come!<br> So tell me, how did it feel?<br> Next time I'm gonna make you<br> get a Q-Tip with some aftershave...<br> and I'm gonna make you<br> stick it up that dick of yours.<br> Call me, bitch.<br> Bend the card!<br> They don't want another dog.<br> - Well, neither do I.<br> - Neither do I.<br> - Neither do I.<br> - Neither do I!<br> - Neither do I!<br> - I! I! I!<br> I!<br> I don't even see<br> what the difference is.<br> They're not even gonna know<br> who Suzy is in a week.<br> Let's take the kids, put them in the car,<br> drive around and see if anybody's seen him.<br> - Can't do it. I got plans.<br> - Oh, Gene, come on!<br> Sherri, I told you<br> a week and a half ago...<br> I got the leadership... council thing<br> on the... crack kids.<br> What you should do is,<br> you should go out with the kids...<br> put up some signs, offer a reward... -<br> not too much.<br> - Remember, it's a dog.<br> - Who's Claire "The Clown" Kane?<br> What are you doing<br> looking in my pockets?<br> What are you doing with<br> her driver's license and telephone number?<br> You wanna know?<br> I'll tell you.<br> Claire Kane, a.k.a. "The Clown"...<br> is a bunco artist<br> wanted in three states.<br> I have her phone number because I'm<br> running a sting operation. Now you know.<br> And now, unfortunately...<br> I have compromised your safety<br> and the children's safety.<br> Are you happy now?<br> There is a... -<br> a hard, heavy physicality...<br> in my new paintings...<br> in part because I've executed them<br> on large panels of wood...<br> but I'd say that<br> they're tempered by the... -<br> - Oh. Sorry.<br> - Sorry.<br> Um, tempered by<br> the ephemeral use of color.<br> You could almost say<br> that it's beyond natural color.<br> What are they about?<br> Well...<br> I think they're about seeing...<br> and the responsibility<br> that comes with that.<br> - Okay.<br> - And call next week.<br> - Thanks. Thank you very much.<br> - Bye.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Who was that? Sherri?<br> No, that was David...<br> at the gallery.<br> Oh. David at the gallery.<br> I'm hoping to get a show there.<br> Is this "David at the gallery" going to be<br> another Mitchell Anderson in our lives?<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> Well, that's the sort of stuff you two<br> used to blather on about, isn't it?<br> What are you talking about?<br> The lousy painter. The one who never<br> sold anything. Mitchell Anderson.<br> just because he never sold anything<br> doesn't mean he was a lousy painter.<br> So you've said.<br> Well, it's true.<br> You know,<br> scientifically speaking, Marian...<br> there's no such thing<br> as "beyond natural color."<br> I don't know why we're sittin'<br> around here actin' like it was our fault.<br> We didn't have<br> anything to do with it.<br> Yeah. Suppose we'd never<br> come up here in the first place.<br> When would she have been found?<br> Maybe never. Nothing we can do to help.<br> She must have been murdered.<br> I mean, she's naked and everything.<br> Nothing we're gonna<br> do about it tonight, anyway.<br> Suppose it floats away.<br> Then it's out of our hands.<br> Maybe that's what we oughta do... -<br> kick it loose and let somebody else find it.<br> Ah, I don't know. I think we<br> oughta tie it up so it won't float away.<br> Then we can, uh, you know,<br> deal with it in the morning.<br> What do you say about that?<br> I say we got two hours of prime trout<br> time left. That's what we oughta deal with.<br> Hey, let's take a vote.<br> All right by me.<br> Fish now,<br> or deal with the body.<br> I say fish now.<br> Suppose the current takes it away.<br> Then it's not our problem.<br> The Planeteers are trying to<br> save the planet and the environment.<br> Uh, they're all<br> wonderful characters.<br> - Tell Gene where he comes from.<br> - The tropical rain forest.<br> - This one?<br> - This is Ma-Ti.<br> His power is heart.<br> Let's see. Where is his ring?<br> They all come with little... -<br> - Stormy did this to me on purpose.<br> I'm gonna kill him.<br> - This is Kwame. He has the power of earth.<br> Let's say he points his ring<br> at, maybe, Earth, and... -<br> Chad, you know what?<br> I think that it was really nice<br> that Gene brought us here tonight...<br> and I think we should say<br> thank you.<br> - Don't you?<br> - Mommy, can I go to the bathroom, please?<br> Yeah.<br> - Wait. Where is it?<br> - Uh, excuse me, miss.<br> Where's the restroom?<br> - For him? I'll take him.<br> - Thanks.<br> Come on. I'll show you.<br> What's that?<br> - What?<br> - That.<br> Happy birthday.<br> What is it? An alarm clock?<br> It's pretty.<br> My marriage is breaking up.<br> Oh, honey, really?<br> Really.<br> I can't think of anything but you.<br> Not at work,<br> not about the trial.<br> just you.<br> I think I'm, uh... -<br> I think I'm, uh, getting serious.<br> Oh, honey, I wanna be with you too.<br> - Hello.<br> - Mrs. Finnigan, please.<br> Uh, sorry, she's not here right now.<br> - Who's this?<br> - This is Mr. Bitkower.<br> She placed an order today, and I just wanted<br> to make sure I was clear about what she wanted.<br> Her drawing's a little messy.<br> Well, she isn't here right now.<br> Call her back next week. All right?<br> Hello.<br> I don't appreciate<br> being hung up on...<br> when I'm calling about your order.<br> I need to know whether Mrs. Finnigan<br> wanted a bat or a mitt. May I speak to her?<br> No, you may not. Whatever it is,<br> just cancel it and stop calling here.<br> Now, we've got a problem here.<br> We don't need the line tied up<br> with unimportant stuff!<br> Either you give me an answer now... -<br> Look, fuck you, asshole.<br> Fuck you!<br> Jesus.<br> Goddamn it!<br> All right, tomorrow night<br> we'll get a motel room.<br> - When?<br> - Tomorrow night.<br> Oh, no, I can't.<br> I'm going away for the weekend.<br> - What?<br> - Goin' to Tahoe, see my sister.<br> - Tahoe? When did that get decided on?<br> - I don't know. Last week.<br> Your sister?<br> Thought your sister lived in Michigan.<br> - That's Phyllis. This is Bunny.<br> Bunny lives in Tahoe.<br> - Bunny? Who's Bunny?<br> You never mentioned her before.<br> - Yes, I did. She's my half sister.<br> - Half sister?<br> And besi... - Gene, you were always<br> with your family on the weekend.<br> How was I supposed to know<br> you could get away?<br> Oh, well... -<br> I don't know what to think, Betty.<br> Huh.<br> So, is B... - Who is Bunny?<br> - Bunny... -<br> - Bunny... - Who's... -<br> - Bunny is my half-stepsister.<br> - These your mother's kids or your father's kids?<br> - My dad's wife's kid.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> We have been planning to get together<br> for over a year.<br> - Oh, yeah? Well, what's she do in Tahoe?<br> - What?<br> What does she do in Tahoe?<br> She work? Is she married?<br> - Tahoe's a fancy place to live, you know.<br> - Gene, stop this.<br> I'm going away for a few days<br> to visit my sister.<br> Don't try to make me feel guilty<br> about nothing.<br> You're making mountains out of molehills.<br> - Come on... -<br> - Shh. Kid's back.<br> There's this really neat camera up front.<br> - It's not a real camera.<br> - Did you find the bathroom okay?<br> Uh, yeah. There's a man<br> throwing up in there.<br> - Oh, my God. How awful. Is he all right?<br> - Chad.<br> - I don't know.<br> - You going to visit Aunt Bunny this weekend?<br> How about those peas?<br> Let's eat up some of those peas.<br> - Bunny?<br> - He's too young to remember Bunny, okay?<br> Does not remember Bunny.<br> Eat 'em up.<br> Anyway, it squirts water... -<br> It looks like a real camera. Please?<br> I really want it.<br> Come on. Daddy would buy it for me.<br> You boys have obviously not heard<br> of the Joe Robbins legend, have you?<br> - What can I get you, pal?<br> - Same, Jay.<br> Are you laughin' at me?<br> - No one was laughin' at you.<br> - Go ahead.<br> Next to my cell,<br> a big Spanish brother.<br> 6'4", 6'5'; Eddie Valdez.<br> We called him "Big Ed."<br> I said, "Big Ed, yo, listen.<br> Don't fuck with me."<br> Cat fuck with me.<br> I get my hands on about 30 feet of rope.<br> Now, you may wonder where<br> I get rope in prison.<br> Like I told you, I'm Joe Robbins.<br> Inside or out.<br> It's all in my cell.<br> How you doin'?<br> Good.<br> Here's a song I want to sing for myself.<br> I lay low, like a black cat in the shadows.<br> And I wait for this big Spanish<br> motherfucker to come moseyin' down.<br> As soon as he crossed my path, boom.<br> - I'm tired<br> - Flies on shit... -<br> So tired<br> Around his neck so quick, then pushed him<br> over the fucking guardrail.<br> The rope snaps tight.<br> His fuckin' head pops off.<br> His body keeps plummeting downward,<br> and he falls...<br> neck hole first into the ground.<br> My point is...<br> Big Ed pissed me off just a little bit.<br> - You wanna keep it down so the lady can sing?<br> - You pissin' me off a lot.<br> Wait.<br> Hey, come on.<br> - I made a mistake, all right?<br> - Yeah, you made a mistake.<br> - See, my shit's live.<br> - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.<br> Where was I?

What's the world coming to?<br> I don't know.<br> Nobody knows who did it.<br> Jesus. Well, ours was like<br> a hit-and-run too.<br> A recent graduate of Seton Hall University...<br> he drank every day of his college life.<br> - Beer and Jack Daniel's.<br> - Mom?<br> - Yeah, I'm in here.<br> - Not necessarily together.<br> - He still loves to get buzzed.<br> - Hi.<br> He doesn't do it quite as much.<br> But he's not about to give up drinking.<br> - Hi.<br> - Shh.

He's a... -<br> - You don't know.<br> I don't want to hear that anymore.<br> You told that story<br> one time too many.<br> Look at me. He was drunk anyway,<br> and you know it.<br> He's all I've got. I need company.<br> We're addicted to addiction.<br> Honey, yesterday I hit a kid.<br> - What?<br> - I hit an eight-year-old kid.<br> He wasn't hurt. I just kind of brushed him,<br> knocked him down.<br> But it was so close.<br> He's such a little sweetie too.<br> I tried to give him a lift to his house.<br> He told me his mom and dad told him...<br> never to get into the car with anybody<br> unless they said it was okay.<br> Oh. You're very lucky,<br> you know that?<br> If I'd been going faster,<br> I would've killed him.<br> Imagine.<br> How could you get over that?<br> You couldn't.<br> I came home. I told Earl<br> our whole life could change.<br> Earl tells me to go on a diet.<br> That's all he could think of to say.<br> Hey!<br> I tell ya? Did I tell ya?<br> That's the best fishing I've ever had.<br> Yeah, but I lost four<br> of those motherfuckers.<br> Yeah, but tell me it wasn't worth it. I mean,<br> even four hours of walking is worth this.<br> Yeah, but what are we gonna...<br> do about you-know-what?<br> I'm gonna take another picture.<br> Okay. Uh, right there, bring it down a little bit.<br> Right on the cantabile. A little bit down.<br> Zoe, i-i-is that bothering you?<br> - It looks terrible.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Can we start right... -<br> - How did you do that?<br> Um, I fell carrying my mom's lunch tray.<br> - Can we start right at... - at... -<br> - By the way, how is your mother?<br> - Is... - Is she all right?<br> - No.<br> I don't think she's got much time left.<br> I... - I can see her change right in front of my eyes.<br> It's a cruel disease.<br> Can... - Can we start at number six?<br> Okay. Number six.<br> Ah.<br> - Hello? Howard?<br> - No, this is not Howard.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Who are you calling?<br> Casey.<br> I want to talk about<br> that little bastard Casey.<br> Casey? Who is this?<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> This is good. Is that Suzy?<br> Is that her tail?<br> That's nice. I really like that.<br> - Marian.<br> - Okay.<br> - Don't let the kids see.<br> - Why?<br> 'Cause I don't want to hear<br> Gene's bullshit.<br> No!<br> He's playing around.<br> I can smell it on him.<br> - You think it's serious?<br> - As serious as it ever is.<br> Why do you put up with it, Sherri?<br> I just got to sweat it out.<br> She'll dump him, and then he'll come running<br> home to Mommy all lovey-dovey.<br> - It's always the same story.<br> - He's such an asshole.<br> He's such a liar.<br> Sometimes I ask him stuff<br> just to entertain myself.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Just to see what kind of cockamamy lie...<br> he's gonna come up with next.<br> I mean, some of the stories<br> are really fantastic.<br> Betty.<br> How's the sex?<br> Well, he's real quick.<br> He's too quick for me.<br> Plus, he won't do oral.<br> - Do you?<br> - I used to, before we got married.<br> I would if he would stop<br> fooling around. I kind of like it.<br> What about you?<br> - Ralph's pretty conservative.<br> - Yeah?<br> No!<br> How about other than Ralph?<br> Oh, we've been married<br> a long time, Sherri.<br> There's never been anybody else<br> since you've been married?<br> No.<br> Yeah. Me neither.<br> Not since the kids.<br> This atmosphere sure brings it<br> back to me, son, I'll tell ya.<br> How many years has it been?<br> Say, what? Maybe 25 years?<br> - What?<br> - Your accident.<br> Oh, it's about, uh, 30.<br> I don't know where<br> all that time went.<br> Oh.<br> Howard. Uh-oh.<br> You remember?<br> I brought it along to show, uh... -<br> - Casey.<br> - C-C-Casey. Yeah.<br> Casey.<br> Speaking of that,<br> you know the creek?<br> You can't cross it anymore now.<br> They put a gate up about 10, 11 year... -<br> - Yeah, 11 years ago. Just before I left.<br> - Yeah? That's good.<br> Of course, if they'd had a gate,<br> that would have...<br> changed things, wouldn't it?<br> I mean, you wouldn't have been<br> in the hospital that day.<br> And I... - Hell, you probably<br> wouldn't be out here.<br> You might not have even had Casey,<br> let alone him being in the hospital.<br> We could still be back<br> in Minnesota with me, and married... -<br> Pop, stop it.<br> Hi. This is the Finnigan home.<br> We can't get to the phone right now,<br> so leave a message after the beep.<br> "Oh, somewhere in this favored land...<br> "the sun is shining bright...<br> "the band is playing somewhere...<br> "and somewhere hearts are light.<br> "And somewhere men are laughing...<br> "and somewhere children shout...<br> "but there is no joy in Mudville... -<br> mighty Casey has struck out."<br> You still resent my not being<br> in the hospital with you, don't ya?<br> No, I don't.<br> I don't even remember.<br> Yeah, you do.<br> You know it, uh... -<br> it wasn't my decision.<br> Things had gotten so out of hand<br> between your mother and me by then that I... -<br> Hell, I didn't want to be in your room<br> and make it worse.<br> I don't even remember the hospital.<br> I remember, uh,<br> the car flippin' over...<br> and gettin' washed away.<br> That's about it.<br> I did something that day<br> that I'd never done in my life.<br> I didn't tell your mother the truth.<br> Called in sick, and then I left<br> like I was going to work.<br> And I didn't tell your mother<br> I was going over to Olla's house...<br> to hook up a new fridge<br> and an ice maker.<br> She'd have had a fit!<br> I mean, even if she knew<br> that I was getting paid for my time...<br> she would have had a fit.<br> It was okay for her to help Olla.<br> Oh, not for me.<br> See? She was very possessive that way.<br> Well, sisters are funny, you know.<br> Hell, in this case, I was happy to oblige.<br> I needed the extra money.<br> And it was Olla's idea<br> not to involve your mother.<br> It was Olla's idea for me to lie.<br> I figured it would take a couple hours.<br> Then I'll go to work, tell 'em I'm feeling better.<br> Anyway, I... - I told Olla<br> I'd be over early, and I was.<br> But there was no answer.<br> So, uh, the... - the door was open.<br> I go in. I hear that she's up in the shower.<br> So, I holler out...<br> you know, so that she won't get scared<br> when she comes out of the shower...<br> and hears me working<br> down in the basement, and so forth.<br> Anyway, I go down.<br> After a while, Olla...<br> comes down to the basement...<br> in a robe.<br> Huh?<br> And she says that<br> she got cleaned up... for me.<br> And I think that's very odd to say<br> under the circumstances.<br> But you know Olla.<br> Anyhow, she says, "How's it going?"<br> I said, "Fine."<br> And, uh, after a while she... -<br> Yeah, she asked me if I wanted a beer.<br> She says, "You want a beer?"<br> I said, "Geez, it's a little early in the morning<br> for that sort of thing, isn't it?"<br> She says, "Well, I'm not your employer, am I?<br> Do you want one or not?"<br> I said, "Oh, well, what the hell. Why not?"<br> It seemed like a good idea at the time.<br> She comes back with two beers.<br> I tell ya, every time I finish a beer... - foom!<br> There's another one in my hand.<br> Christ, now we're up in the kitchen.<br> And I'm havin' trouble makin' the joints connect... -<br> I... - 'Cause I'm on<br> my fourth or fifth beer.<br> And I said, "Olla... -"<br> In fact, this is exactly what I said.<br> Oh, I'll never forget this.<br> I said, "Olla, if I have one more beer,<br> I'm gonna have to take a nap."<br> And she says,<br> "I wondered what it would take...<br> to get you into bed."<br> Hey.<br> Now, I laughed. You know, I... -<br> She says, "Don't tell me it didn't<br> cross your mind, because I'll call you a liar."<br> Well, I'll tell you the truth.<br> It didn't... ever!<br> Yeah, I found her company attractive.<br> But, Jesus, there was no real... -<br> And I didn't... -<br> I don't know. I didn't want<br> to hurt her feelings, you know?<br> I mean, after all,<br> it was your mother's sister.<br> Anyway, I, uh... -<br> I don't know how much time passed.<br> All I know is that I am working like hell on<br> that ice maker trying to get the damn thing going.<br> And she is saying things like, uh...<br> "If the positions were reversed,<br> my sister would be doing the same thing."<br> Do you believe... - You know, like this is<br> some little thing between the two of... -<br> I-I started sweating. I tell you, my knees<br> are shaking. I don't know what the hell to do.<br> - I don't know which way to turn.<br> - There's no smokin' in here, Pop.<br> - Huh?<br> - No smoking.<br> Oh, that's good.<br> Down to four a day.<br> And then...<br> she opens the robe.<br> And I get a load... - Oh, Jesus.<br> God, that woman was put together...<br> a hell of lot better than you'd think<br> when she was just in a dress.<br> I'm tellin' ya.<br> Jesus, that's hard for any man to resist.<br> I mean... - I don't know about you... -<br> it sure as hell was for me.<br> Yeah, well, that, uh... -<br> that's a long time ago, Pop.<br> So... -<br> Neither of us heard<br> your mother come in.<br> Oh, God Almighty.<br> She was in such a state.<br> You know, she... -<br> Sh-She... - She didn't really look at Olla.<br> She just... -<br> She looked at me, and she said,<br> "Howard's in the hospital."<br> And then on... - on the way<br> to the hospital, she said... -<br> Well, she cried a little bit.<br> But... - But she... - she only said...<br> "Why didn't you tell me<br> that you weren't going to work?<br> They told me you were sick."<br> Oh, Christ, I was so ashamed.<br> I just... -<br> It was... -<br> It was an unlucky day, you know?<br> Bad... timing.<br> But I tell you, that first day<br> in the hospital...<br> your mother and I stood side by side<br> while those doctors reported to us.<br> And most of the news was bad.<br> But still, we stood there together.<br> We took it together!<br> And then Olla lied.<br> God! Olla told your mother that... - that...<br> we'd been having affairs in the past.<br> It was only that one time.<br> I tr... - Oh, I tried to explain to your mother...<br> exactly how it happened.<br> You know what your mother said...<br> to me?<br> "I don't want you around anymore.<br> "I'll get through this thing alone... better.<br> No matter what<br> happens to Howard."<br> I had to respect her wishes, Howard.<br> I mean, whether I wanted to or not.<br> I had to.<br> Christ, I kept thinking, you know,<br> someday... - some... - some... - some... -<br> The truth will come out, you know,<br> and she'll understand.<br> We both know<br> that never happened, so... -<br> Mr. Finnigan? Excuse me, Mr. Finnigan.<br> Uh, you have a telephone call.<br> It's Mrs. Finnigan.<br> Oh, you can use that phone right there.<br> Yeah, hi. Everything's okay here.<br> You all right?<br> Um, I'm coming back to the hospital.<br> Do you want me to bring you anything?<br> Why? You should get<br> a good night's sleep.<br> - Casey's gonna be all right.<br> - I'm not staying here.<br> That crazy person keeps calling.<br> I'm scared to death.<br> Well, don't, uh... -<br> don't answer the phone, honey.<br> Maybe it's the... -<br> the driver from the car.<br> Maybe she's, uh, feeling guilty<br> or something.<br> It's a man.<br> Well, don't worry.<br> I mean, I'm here with Casey.<br> The doctors and the nurses<br> are there with him all the time.<br> - He's gonna be all right.<br> - No, I'm comin'.<br> No... - I wish you wouldn't. Honey?<br> Uh, you finish your coffee.<br> I gotta get back.<br> Hi. This is the Finnigan home.<br> We can't get to the phone right now,<br> so leave a message after the beep.<br> - That is a good painting.<br> - Yeah.<br> Really good.<br> - Colors are good.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Goes with the walls.<br> - But look at these fish, though.<br> - Aren't those cool?<br> - Mmm.<br> - Aren't those cool?<br> - Yeah, I don't really give a fuck about fish.<br> They just kinda swim and shit.<br> - Hey, your makeup looks good.<br> - Yeah?<br> - You think it's too much, though?<br> - No. You're like a model.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey.<br> - Almost ready.<br> - Did Bill do it?<br> - Yeah. Of course he did.<br> - Bill, you've gotta do me sometime.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Hey, make mine well-done.<br> Hey.<br> Look at that.<br> - Look at that.<br> - Looks pretty.<br> So, what were you saying<br> about, um, the virt... -<br> - What is it?

It's ancient history.<br> - No.<br> Something's on your mind.<br> - That party.<br> - What party?<br> You know what party I'm talking about,<br> Marian. The one with Mitchell Anderson.<br> Jesus, Ralph.<br> That was three years ago.<br> - You kissed him, didn't you?<br> - No.<br> - Your lipstick was smeared when you came back.<br> - How would you know? You were drunk!<br> Jesus Christ, look at this.<br> Goddamn it! Look at this!<br> Look what you made me do!<br> Goddamn it! I wanted to wear this.<br> That's the way you looked that night with<br> Mitchell Anderson when you were out necking.<br> - He kissed you, didn't he?<br> - Come on, Ralph.<br> I thought we were through with that.<br> I want you to tell me about<br> that night with Mitchell Anderson.<br> - There's nothing to tell.<br> - All right.<br> Then tell me about nothingness. I'd like<br> to hear a complete account of nothing...<br> what you didn't do<br> for two and a half hours.<br> Why, Ralph? What's so important?<br> It was three years ago.<br> All right, it's not important.<br> It's water under the bridge.<br> But what irritates me, Marian... -<br> if that's the right word for it... -<br> is that you won't tell me the truth.<br> You can't say the obvious.<br> You can't admit that you lied!<br> That's what I don't like, Marian,<br> having to play this charade.<br> God, Ralph.<br> How did this start?<br> Do you know how this started?<br> 'Cause I really... -<br> - I really don't know how this started.<br> - Marian, look at me!<br> - You don't have any panties on.<br> - Do you know how this started?<br> What do you think you are,<br> one of your goddamn paintings?<br> Marian, I'm giving you<br> a chance to come clean...<br> clear the slate,<br> on to a higher consciousness.<br> And then,<br> don't ever lie to me again, Marian.<br> - This is not like you, Ralph.<br> - What, to demand?

All right, Ralph. Okay.<br> Somehow... - Somehow the two of us<br> were elected to go out and get liquor.<br> We drove to the Foremost,<br> which was closed...<br> and then to Cappy's,<br> which was also closed.<br> In fact, everything was closed.<br> I mean, I was beginning to wonder<br> whether anything would be open...<br> and all I could think of were those<br> all-night supermarkets, and... -<br> I wondered whether anybody<br> would even be in the mood for a drink...<br> if we had to drive around half the night<br> looking for an open market.<br> He was really drunk.<br> I hadn't even realized how drunk he was<br> until we started driving.<br> And he was driving... -<br> he was driving terribly slow.<br> He was all hunched over the wheel,<br> and we were talking.<br> We were talking about a lot of things...<br> a lot of things that didn't make sense...<br> I mean, about, uh, religious images...<br> and about this... -<br> about this painter,<br> this painter named Larry Rivers.<br> And, uh... - And then he started talking<br> about Norman Mailer...<br> and about how Norman Mailer<br> stabbed his wife in the breast.<br> And he said he'd hate it<br> if anybody did that to me.<br> He said he'd like to kiss my breast.<br> And then he pulled the car over<br> to the side of the road, and...<br> then he kissed me.<br> How long?<br> How long what?<br> How long did he kiss you?<br> Then what?<br> Then he said,<br> "Do you wanna have a go at it?"<br> Jesus, Marian.<br> "Do you wanna have a go at it?"<br> What... -<br> "Do you wanna have a go at it?<br> Do you wanna have a go at it?"<br> What does that mean, Marian?<br> "Do you wanna have a go at it?"<br> Did he kiss your tits?<br> Did you touch him?<br> Touch him? Touch him?<br> Okay, Ralph.<br> Ralph, you wanna know what happened?<br> He kissed me, and I kissed him back.<br> And then we did it.<br> We did it right there in the car.<br> He fucked me right there in the car.<br> I was drunk.<br> It didn't mean anything to me.<br> I wish it hadn't happened,<br> but it did.<br> Is that all? Is that all you wanna know?<br> Is that all?<br> Yes, Marian.<br> - That's all.<br> - Ralph, he didn't come in me.<br> - I swear to God, he didn't come in me.<br> - Okay.<br> Where are you going, Ralph?<br> Well, Marian, we have guests coming,<br> and I'm gonna go and light the barbecue.<br> Each day<br> Just about sunset<br> I watch you<br> Passing my door<br> It's all I can do<br> Not to run to you<br> - We're closed.<br> - But I don't wanna cry<br> - Can I help you?<br> - No, I just came to talk to my mom.<br> - Who's your mom?<br> - That's my mom.<br> Nighttime<br> - Who's that?<br> - She says she's Tess's kid.<br> You're kidding me.<br> A string player?<br> The same old moon<br> We knew before<br> It's all I can do<br> Not to run to you<br> Hold it.<br> What are you doing here, Zoe?<br> - Mom, Casey died.<br> - Casey? Who's that?<br> The little boy who lives<br> right next door.<br> - He got run over by a car.<br> - I'll be damned. Just like that?<br> Kids.<br> I just saw Mrs. Finnigan.<br> I feel so bad for them,<br> and I thought you'd wanna know.<br> It's a cryin' shame, baby.<br> - She must feel like shit.<br> - Mom.<br> Why don't you go sit over here?<br> We're just rehearsing.<br> - Okay, let's try it again.<br> - Mom.<br> From the top, okay?<br> Each day<br> Just about sunset<br> I watch you<br> Passing my door<br> It's all I can do<br> Not to run to you<br> But I don't wanna cry<br> Anymore<br> Suzy!
