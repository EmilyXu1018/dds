                        Oh, fuck.<br> - Uh, yeah?<br> - Miles, can you move your car, please?<br> - Why?<br> - Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.<br> - You didn't park too good. Okay?<br> - Yeah. All right.<br> Hold on.<br> Sorry. Sorry, gentlemen.<br> Sorry.<br> Oh, fuck me!<br> I know I said<br> I would be there by noon...<br> but, uh, there's all of this work<br> going on at my building...<br> and it's just a total nightmare.<br> I had a bunch of stuff<br> I had to deal with this morning...<br> but I'm on my way.<br> I'm out the door right now.<br> - Hi, Simon.<br> - Hey, Miles.<br> - Triple espresso, please?<br> - For here?<br> Uh, no, actually.<br> I'm running late. Make it to go.<br> And give me a New York Times<br> and a spinach croissant.<br> Thank you.<br> - Ah!<br> - Well, hello!<br> - Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?<br> - Come on in.<br> - Thank you. Is Jack still here?<br> - Yes.<br> Shot on the way to the 118.<br> Look what the cat dragged.<br> - Hi, everybody. Sorry.<br> - Hey.<br> Somebody finally arrived.<br> You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.<br> - Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?<br> - Hi. How are you?<br> We were thinking maybe you went<br> the wrong way, you went to Tijuana...<br> - Right.<br> - and they don't let you back.<br> - Yes! Yes!<br> - Daddy!<br> - I had to bribe them.<br> - Hey, Miles.<br> Hey. How are you, Christine?<br> - Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.<br> Unbelievable.<br> It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.<br> People getting an early start<br> on the weekend, I guess.<br> Granted, I got a late start, but--<br> Well, we're just glad you made it.<br> Christine, why don't you<br> ask Miles about the cake?<br> - Oh, good idea. Come with me.<br> - What's this?<br> We don't really have time for that,<br> 'cause we gotta hit the road.<br> - Oh, come on! It's just gonna take a second!<br> - Yeah.<br> Mmm.<br> Jack tells us you are publishing a book.<br> Congratulations.<br> - Uh--<br> - Yes, congratulations.<br> Yes, well, uh,<br> it's not exactly finalized yet.<br> - So-- There has been some interest, and--<br> - Your friend is modest.<br> Oh, come on, Miles.<br> Don't be so modest. Indulge them.<br> - Don't make me out to be a liar.<br> - What is the subject of your book?<br> - Nonfiction?<br> - Uh, no. It's-- It's a novel.<br> - Fiction. Yes.<br> - Oh.<br> Although there is quite a bit<br> from my own life...<br> so I suppose that, technically,<br> some of it is nonfiction.<br> Good. I like nonfiction.<br> There is so much to know<br> about this world.<br> I think you read something somebody<br> just invented it, waste of time.<br> That's an interesting perspective.<br> - So, which one do you like better?<br> - Oh, well, I like them both.<br> But, um, if pressed, I would have to say<br> that I prefer the dark.<br> - Told ya!<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Bye.<br> Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?<br> I was dying in there.<br> - We're supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.<br> - I can't help the traffic.<br> Oh, come on. You're fucking hangover.<br> You know you are.<br> Okay, there was<br> a tasting last night, yes.<br> But I wanted to get us something nice<br> for the ride up. Check out the box.<br> Why did you tell them<br> that my novel was being published?<br> - 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.<br> - No, I didn't. No. No.<br> What I said was that there was<br> some interest at Conundrum.<br> - Yeah. Conundrum.<br> - And that one of the editors was passing it to a senior editor.<br> Sounds pretty good to me.<br> Sounds like you're in.<br> No. It's a long shot.<br> Besides, Conundrum,<br> it's just a small specialty press.<br> I'm not gonna get my hopes up.<br> You know? I've stopped caring.<br> The hell with it.<br> I have stopped caring.<br> It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.<br> I mean, I can feel it.<br> I think this is the one. Huh?<br> I'm really proud of you, man.<br> - Don't open that now. It's warm.<br> - Why not?<br> Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.<br> It's really rare. Okay?<br> - I've been saving it. Don't--<br> - All right. I won't open it.<br> - Jack!<br> - Half of it gone.<br> Hey, shut up. Okay?<br> Here's to a great week.<br> - Come on.<br> Yes. Absolutely.<br> Despite your crass behaviour...<br> I'm actually glad<br> we're getting this time together.<br> Yeah. Me too.<br> I've been looking forward to this<br> for a long time.<br> - Was beginning to think it was never gonna happen.<br> - Man! That's tasty!<br> That's 100% pinot noir.<br> Single vineyard.<br> They don't even make it anymore.<br> - Pinot noir?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Then how come it's white?<br> - Oh Jesus.<br> Don't ask questions like that<br> up in wine country.<br> - They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.<br> - Just tell me.<br> Colour in red wines<br> comes from the skins.<br> This juice, on the other hand,<br> is free run...<br> so that there's no skin contact<br> during fermentation--<br> Did you read the latest draft, by the way?<br> - Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br> - And?<br> It's great.<br> I mean, there are so many improvements.<br> It's much tighter.<br> Just seems-- I don't know,<br> more congealed or something.<br> Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?<br> Did you like that?<br> Oh, yeah. New ending<br> vastly superior to the old ending.<br> There is no new ending.<br> Page 750 on is exactly the same.<br> Well, maybe it just seemed new...<br> because everything leading up to it<br> was so different?<br> Yeah! That must be it!<br> Whoa. Why are we getting off?<br> - Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.<br> - For what?<br> - I just thought we could say a quick hello to my mother.<br> - Your mother?<br> Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.<br> Okay?<br> - And I don't feel right driving by and not stopping in.<br> - Okay.<br> - It'll take a second. She's right off the freeway.<br> - Okay!<br> I didn't know it was her birthday.<br> How old is she gonna be?<br> Uh, oh... 70-something.<br> Oh. Here, hold these<br> for just a second.<br> Thank you.<br> - Surprise!<br> - Surprise!<br> - Happy birthday, Mom!<br> - Happy birthday!<br> Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!<br> What a surprise!<br> I can't remember the last time<br> you brought me flowers!<br> Happy birthday, Mom.<br> They're from both of us.<br> - A famous actor bringing me flowers for my birthday!<br> - Right? Yeah!<br> - Don't I feel special?<br> - And champagne!<br> - Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.<br> - Oh, that's right!<br> Isn't that nice.<br> I hope that girl knows<br> how lucky she is...<br> marrying no less<br> than Derek Sommersby.<br> Gosh, that was, like, 11 years ago,<br> Mrs. Raymond.<br> - Well, you were wonderful in that show!<br> Why that didn't make you the biggest<br> movie star in the world is a sin!<br> Oh, now, Miles...<br> why didn't you tell me you were coming<br> and bringing this handsome man?<br> Look how I'm dressed!<br> I've gotta run and put my face on.<br> You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.<br> Oh, stop it!<br> - Make yourselves comfortable.<br> - You boys hungry?<br> - Yeah, I'm hungry.<br> Along with the battle casualties...<br> Just a snack.<br> the Germans lost almost a million men.<br> To replace them, Hitler turned<br> to his last resort of manpower.<br> This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.<br> Absolutely delicious.<br> - Mmm.<br> - They're just leftovers.<br> I- Is this chicken?<br> I could have made something fancier...<br> if a certain someone had let me know<br> that a certain someone...<br> was coming for a visit<br> and bringing a certain special friend.<br> It was a surprise, Mom.<br> And I could've already put clean sheets...<br> on the other bed and the foldout.<br> You are staying.<br> Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up<br> at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.<br> They do a magnificent job there.<br> - You talked to Wendy?<br> - Just now.<br> She's thrilled! And the twins--<br> No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.<br> Well, you know, Jack is pretty eager<br> to, uh, to get up to, um--<br> You know.<br> Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.<br> We'll see how it goes.<br> Well, you boys do what you want.<br> I just thought it would be nice for us<br> to be together as a family on my birthday.<br> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.<br> I'll be right back.<br> And what was that other one you did?<br> The one where you were the jogger.<br> Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.<br> Spray 'n Wash! That's the one!<br> Gosh. I remember the girl that was<br> in it with me. She was somethin'.<br> I just remember you jogging.<br> Whoo-hoo!<br> So, when's the wedding?<br> Next Saturday, Mom.<br> Remember? We told you.<br> And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond.<br> My main man.<br> Miles, when are you going<br> to get married again?<br> I just got divorced, Phyllis.<br> Two years ago, buddy.<br> You should get back together...<br> with Victoria.<br> She was good for you.<br> She was good for you!<br> And so beautiful, and so intelligent.<br> You knew her, right?<br> Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.<br> I'm worried about you, Miles.<br> Do you need some money?<br> Jack.<br> Jack.<br> Jack, come on.<br> A rubber bag food slinger?<br> Are you kidding me?<br> Our super-amazing tree house...<br> brought about by our<br> two-by-four technology--<br> Jack! No, no, no, no. She'll wake up.<br> Who did this?<br> - I did!<br> - What?<br> She was tired, silly.<br> Our ship was so high!<br> They need a vacation!<br> Hamster holiday! Fun for all!<br> Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Oh. She's a kid, for God's sake.<br> As if she would even be attracted<br> to guys like us in the first place.<br> Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks<br> looking at me all the time. All ages.<br> Dudes too.<br> Well, it's not worth it.<br> You pay too big a price.<br> - It's never free.<br> - You need to get laid, Miles.<br> - - That's gonna be<br> my best-man gift to you this week.<br> I'm gonna get you laid.<br> Wonderful.<br> I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate<br> or a penknife or any of that other horseshit.<br> - I'd rather have a knife.<br> - No.<br> You have been officially depressed<br> for, like, two years now.<br> You're a negative guy anyway,<br> even back in college.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - And now it's worse.<br> You're wasting away. Teaching English<br> to fucking eighth-graders?<br> When they oughta be reading what you wrote.<br> Your books, Miles.<br> - I'm working on it.<br> - Not working hard enough.<br> - Are you still seeing that shrink?<br> - I saw him on Monday.<br> I spent most of the time<br> helping him with his computer.<br> Well, I say fuck therapy and--<br> What is that stuff you take? Xanax?<br> And Lexapro, yes.<br> Well, I say fuck that too.<br> You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.<br> Okay, Jack-- Jack--<br> This week is not about me.<br> It is about you.<br> I'm gonna show you a good time.<br> We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,<br> we're gonna play some golf...<br> we're gonna eat some great food,<br> enjoy the scenery...<br> and we're gonna send you off in style,<br> mon frere.<br> And get your bone smooched.<br> You know what?<br> Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit<br> and hit Sanford first. Okay?<br> Sounds good to me. I need a drink.<br> These guys make top-notch pinot<br> and chardonnay.<br> One of the best producers<br> in Santa Barbara County.<br> - I thought you hated chardonnay.<br> - No, no, no. I like all varietals.<br> I just don't generally like the way<br> they manipulate chardonnay in California.<br> - Too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.<br> - Huh.<br> You see, the reason that this region<br> is so good for pinot...<br> is that the cold air off the Pacific<br> flows in at night...<br> and it just cools down the berries.<br> Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.<br> It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.<br> Very delicate.<br> Let me show you how this is done.<br> First thing-- hold the glass up and<br> examine the wine against the light.<br> You're looking for colour and clarity.<br> - Just get a sense of it. Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Now tip it.<br> What you're doing here is checking for colour<br> density as it thins out towards the rim.<br> That's gonna tell you how old it is,<br> among other things.<br> It's usually<br> more important with reds.<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Now stick your nose in it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Don't be shy.<br> Really get your nose right in there.<br> Really--<br> Mmm. A little citrus.<br> Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.<br> Passion fruit. Mmm.<br> And-- Ah, there's just,<br> like, the faintest...<br> soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--<br> There's a-- just a flutter of, like, a--<br> like, a nutty Edam cheese.<br> - Wow.<br> Mmm!<br> - Strawberries. Yeah.<br> - Good.<br> - Strawberries. Not the cheese.<br> - All right.<br> Put your glass down.<br> Get some air into it.<br> Oxygenating it opens it up.<br> It unlocks the aromas, the flavours.<br> Very important.<br> - Smell again.<br> Ah. That's what you do<br> with every one of 'em.<br> - Wow. When do we drink it?<br> - Now.<br> Mmm! Ahh.<br> - Mmm.<br> - How would you rate this one, Miles?<br> Well, usually they start you on wines<br> with learning disabilities...<br> but this one is pretty damn good.<br> - This is the new one. Right, Chris?<br> - Just released two months ago.<br> - Nice job.<br> - We like it.<br> You could work in a wine store,<br> Miles.<br> Mmm. Yeah.<br> That'd be a good move.<br> Are you chewing gum?<br> Do you think I'm making a mistake<br> marrying Christine?<br> Whoa!<br> Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?<br> Tell me the truth.<br> I mean, you've been there.<br> Well, you know, I-- I think that you<br> waited for some good reason...<br> and that you proposed to Christine<br> for some good reason...<br> so I think it's great.<br> It's time.<br> I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,<br> that's all.<br> I mean, look at me.<br> I thought Victoria and I were set for life.<br> Christine's dad,<br> he's really been talking to me...<br> about bringing me into his property business,<br> showing me the ropes.<br> Which is something, considering how long<br> it took him to get over my not being Armenian.<br> So I'm thinking about it.<br> But I don't know.<br> Might get a little incestuous.<br> But Mike does great.<br> A lot of high-end commercial stuff.<br> - So you're gonna stop acting?<br> - No way! No.<br> This would just provide some stability.<br> I could always squeeze in a commercial<br> or an audition here, there.<br> Keep myself in the game in case<br> something really great came along.<br> We're not getting any younger, Miles.<br> No. No.<br> - Hey, hey, hey!<br> - Hey.<br> - Miles!<br> - Sir.<br> - Long time no see.<br> - Gary, nice to see you.<br> - When's your novel coming out?

Why do you have to<br> focus on the negative?<br> - See how friendly she was to you?<br> - She works for tips.<br> You're blind, dude. Blind.<br> I can also recommend the ostrich steak.<br> Very lean. Locally raised.<br> Hey, Gary.<br> - Highliner, please.<br> - You got it.<br> - That's on us.<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> Well, hey, guys.

Wow.<br> It's getting published.<br> That's, uh, actually why<br> we're up here celebrating.<br> Well, congratulations.<br> - That's fantastic!<br> - Yeah.<br> - Cheers.<br> - Thanks.<br> Are you a writer too?<br> No, Maya, I'm an actor.<br> Really. What kind of stuff?<br> Mmm, a lot of TV.<br> I used to be a regular<br> on a couple of series.<br> But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.<br> Nationals, mostly.<br> Anything I might know?<br> Perhaps. Do you recognize this?<br> Now with a low, low<br> That's hilarious!<br> - You sound just like one of those guys.<br> - Am one of those guys.<br> - You are not.<br> - He is.<br> Consult your doctor<br> before using this product.<br> Side effects may include oily discharge...<br> hives, loss of appetite,<br> low blood pressure.<br> If you have diabetes<br> or a history of kidney trouble...<br> you're dead, asshole!<br> Yeah.<br> So, what are you guys up to tonight?<br> Oh, we're pretty wiped.<br> I think we're just gonna go back<br> to the motel and crash.<br> Yeah, I guess it's<br> kind of a long drive up here.<br> - Mmm.<br> - Where are you staying?<br> Uh, the Windmill.<br> Windmill.<br> The girl is looking to party...<br> and you tell her we're going back<br> to the motel and crash?<br> - Jesus, Miles!<br> - Well, I'm tired, Jack.<br> - Aren't you tired?<br> - The chick digs you, man!<br> She lit up like a pinball machine...<br> when she found out<br> your novel was getting published.<br> Now I have another lie to live down.<br> - Thanks, Jack.<br> - Just trying to get you a little action.<br> I would appreciate a little bit of help.<br> Didn't seem to me like that's what<br> was going on. You were all over her.<br> Well, somebody had to do the talking.<br> And, by the way, I was right--<br> she's not married.<br> - How do you know?<br> - No rock.<br> When she came to the bar,<br> she was sans rock.<br> Oh.<br> What's the plan for today, Miles?<br> Aha.<br> Good. Um, we head up north--<br> Begin the grape tour up there...<br> work our way south...<br> so that the more we drink...<br> the closer we get to the motel.<br> What's your problem?<br> What is it?<br> I'm going to get my nut<br> on this trip, Miles...<br> and you are not gonna<br> fuck it up for me...<br> with all of your depression and anxiety<br> and neg-head downer shit.<br> Oh.<br> Well, now the cards are on the table.<br> Yes, they are.<br> - Ah.<br> - And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.<br> I am going to get laid before I get married<br> on Saturday. Do you read me?<br> Sure, big guy. Absolutely.<br> Loud and clear.<br> Whatever you say.<br> It's, uh, your party, evidently.<br> Why don't you just, uh--<br> Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,<br> and I'll catch a train back.<br> No, Miles!<br> Man, this is our week to get crazy.<br> We should both be cutting loose.<br> This could be our last chance.<br> This is our week, man.<br> It's something we should share.<br> This is our Syrah.<br> Okay.<br> - Ooh!<br> - Yeah? Like that?<br> That's a big one.<br> But it did sit with the skins for<br> about two weeks in an open-topped tank.<br> - So that would explain all the tannins, no?<br> - Well, it is a young wine.<br> - So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.<br> - Right. Of course.<br> - Excuse me for just a minute.<br> - Good stuff.<br> Mmm. Fill up there, bub.<br> This is our estate chardonnay.<br> Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.<br> What's your name?<br> Stephanie.<br> Stephanie. Nice.<br> So, what do you think?<br> Mmm. Quaffable.<br> But, uh, far from transcendent.<br> I like it. Tastes great.<br> Oak-y.<br> This is a cabernet franc.<br> This is only the fifth year<br> we've made this varietal.<br> Very few wineries around here<br> do a straight cab franc.<br> It's from our vineyards<br> up in Santa Maria...<br> and it was a silver medal winner...<br> at Paso Robles last year.<br> Hmm.<br> Mmm.<br> Well, I will tell you something.<br> I've come never to expect greatness from<br> a cab franc, and this one is no different.<br> It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--<br> I don't know.<br> Tastes pretty good to me.<br> So, um, do you live around here,<br> Stephanie?<br> Yeah, up around Los Alamos.<br> And I agree with you about cab franc.<br> We're just over in Buellton.<br> The Windmill Inn.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Mmm.<br> Do you happen to know a gal named Maya<br> that works at The Hitching Post?<br> - Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.<br> - Yeah? No shit?<br> We had a drink with her last night.<br> Miles knows her.<br> Yes. Could we move on<br> to the Syrah, please?<br> Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?<br> Sure.<br> This is our estate Syrah.<br> You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.<br> I know. I need to be spanked.<br> Excuse me.<br> The Syrah?<br> Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.<br> - You have the keys.<br> - I do?<br> - Yeah.<br> - In my pocket.<br> - So, we're on.<br> - What?<br> Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working<br> tonight. So we're all going out.<br> - Wi-- With Maya?<br> - Yeah.<br> She's been divorced a year now, buddy.<br> This chick Stephanie?<br> She's got it all goin' on.<br> Well, she is cute, yeah.<br> Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.<br> And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> - Nice, huh?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> Yeah. Victoria and I<br> used to like this view.<br> You know,<br> once we had a picnic here...<br> and we drank a '95 Opus One.<br> With smoked salmon and artichokes.<br> But we didn't care.<br> Oh, man, she has the best palate<br> of any woman I have ever known.<br> She can even differentiate<br> all different kinds of Italian wines.<br> - Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.<br> Victoria's coming to the wedding.<br> Yeah, I know. You told me.<br> I'm all right with it.<br> Yeah, but that's not the whole story.<br> She got remarried.<br> She what?<br> When?<br> About a month ago.<br> Maybe six weeks.<br> To that guy--<br> that guy with the restaurant?<br> Miles?<br> Miles.<br> I'd like to go home now.<br> Miles, get out of the car.<br> Would you drive me<br> back to the motel, please?<br> You know--<br> She bringing him to the wedding?<br> What do you think?<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> about this before, Jack?<br> Because I knew you'd get so freaked out<br> that you wouldn't even come on this trip.<br> But then I thought,<br> this is the perfect place to tell you.<br> We're here to forget about all that shit.<br> We're here to party, man.<br> I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.<br> Persona non grata.<br> Everybody's gonna be holding their breath,<br> waiting to see if I get drunk and make a scene.<br> No, no. No. Look.<br> I talked to Victoria. Okay?<br> I talked to Victoria. Okay?<br> She's cool. Everybody's cool.<br> I'm sorry. You've been talking--<br> Behind my back...<br> you've been talking about it?<br> What are you doing?<br> Come back here.<br> Miles!<br> - Come here. Give me that bottle.<br> - Back off, Jack.<br> - Come on--<br> - Back off, man!<br> - Give me that bottle.<br> - No.<br> Miles.<br> Miles!<br> A lot of people<br> out there think they can make it.<br> What better thing in life is to chase the<br> dream and not be afraid of going after it?<br> James Lepp next to play.<br> Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.<br> I'm gonna go for a swim,<br> get the blood flowing. You wanna come?<br> No. I wanna watch this.<br> Okay.<br> Should start this ball one or two inches<br> outside the left edge.<br> Go in.<br> - Great putt.<br> - Absolutely. Great speed.<br> - Miles.<br> Miles.<br> Oh, Miles. Time to get up.<br> This fuckin' chick in the Jacuzzi--<br> Oh, dude!<br> This place is wide open.<br> I'm goin' fuckin' nuts up here, man.<br> - Hey, what should I wear?<br> - I don't know.<br> Something casual, but nice.<br> They think you're a writer.<br> Right. Okay.<br> Mmm.<br> Do you have any other shoes?<br> Uh-uh.<br> Hmm.<br> - Hey, honey.<br> Yeah, I was just calling to check in.<br> Miles and I are getting ready<br> to go to dinner.<br> Probably stay out late, so I just thought<br> I'd call and say good night now.<br> Yeah. I miss you too.<br> Yeah. I love you too.<br> Just try to be your normal,<br> humorous self. Okay?<br> The guy you were before the tailspin.<br> Do you remember that guy?<br> People love that guy.<br> And don't forget--<br> your novel is coming out in the fall.<br> Oh. Really? How exciting.<br> What's it called?<br> Come here, Miles. Come here.<br> Do not sabotage me.<br> If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,<br> then that's your call.<br> - But do not sabotage me.<br> - Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.<br> And if they wanna drink merlot,<br> we're drinkin' merlot.<br> If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.<br> I am not drinking any fucking merlot!<br> Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.<br> Jesus. No merlot.<br> Did you bring your Xanax?<br> - All right.<br> Come here.<br> Do not drink too much.<br> Do you hear me?<br> I don't want you passing out<br> or going to the dark side.<br> - No going to the dark side!<br> - Okay!<br> Hi. Just looking for some friends.<br> Good evening, ladies.<br> How are you?<br> - Hi, Miles.<br> - Good. How are you?<br> Hello, Maya.<br> - You look gorgeous. You both do.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're not so bad yourself.<br> - Thanks. Thanks.<br> So, what's good here?<br> - What is this you're drinking?<br> - Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.<br> - Ah, I see. Is it good?<br> - Try it.<br> - What time did you close up at Ka-- Is it--<br> - Kalyra.<br> - Kalyra.<br> - I actually got out of there pretty good, around 5:30, 6:00.<br> - Still had some stuff to do.<br> - Miles and I, we were--<br> - That's nice.<br> - It's aged 12 months in oak.<br> - French oak.<br> - Sauvignon blanc?<br> Huh. Interesting. It's good.<br> I know the winemaker.<br> She comes into the restaurant all the time.<br> - What do you have to do to close up?<br> - I close up the register.<br> Clean up, put some stuff away.<br> Then put the glasses out for the next day.<br> - Right.<br> - Just... small stuff.<br> Uh, hints of clove.<br> - Right?<br> - Yes! I know. I love that.<br> Yeah. Mmm.<br> Sorry. It's good.<br> - No, no. We'll get you a glass.<br> - Ah! Now we're thinking.<br> Good. Okay.<br> Oh, that's-- that--<br> Oh, he can say it,<br> and it's not disgusting?<br> I didn't hear him say that.<br> - Whenever I say something he said--<br> - Very good.<br> No, actually-- No. That one.<br> N- Not this one--<br> I'm having that too.<br> - Right?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> That's what I'm saying.<br> For our soup we have corn chowder...<br> and for our entrees we have medallions<br> of pork dusted with black truffles...<br> served with a root vegetable foulon<br> and wasabi whipped potatoes.<br> And finally--<br> - I have to explain my credentials.<br> - Yes!<br> Miles, what does this remind you of?.<br> "Red wine. Red wine."<br> He was brought up on a lot of charges.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I mean, with the yellow light.<br> Right.<br> After all, tonight<br> we are celebrating Miles's book deal.<br> - Published author.<br> - Oh! Wow!<br> Wow, Miles!<br> - Ohh!<br> - Well, in that case--<br> [Conversations Continue,<br> Faint, Indistinct]<br> And then they think you have no idea.<br> You have no control over it.<br> Ancient way of treating the grape.<br> Now it's a modern way<br> of treating the grape.<br> It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.<br> It's a controversial way.<br> So everyone's going back to that.<br> It's just that there's<br> a certain constant lapping.<br> - It's not a-- It's a fishing lake.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Your lips look soft.<br> - The whole area is--<br> - Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?<br> - What do they call the--<br> Malibu-- It's Malibu Canyon.<br> I don't know what the hell<br> I'm trying to say.<br> - Hello?<br> Victoria?<br> Miles?<br> Well, well, well, well, well.<br> Victoria. How the hell are ya?<br> What-- Uh-- What's on your mind?<br> Oh, nothin'. I--<br> Just heard that you got remarried.<br> Congratulations. I, uh--<br> Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach<br> for another go-around.<br> Oh, Miles, you're drunk.<br> Oh, just a little local pinot,<br> you know.<br> A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.<br> - Where are you?<br> - Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.<br> New owners. Cozy ambience, uh--<br> Excellent food too.<br> You should, uh-- You should try it.<br> I thought of you at the, uh,<br> Hitching Post last night.<br> Hello?<br> - Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.<br> - No, it's--<br> All right, I just--<br> I wanted to let you know...<br> that I have decided<br> not to come to the wedding...<br> so just in case you were dreading some sort of,<br> you know, run-in or something like that...<br> well, you worry no more...<br> because I'm not gonna be there.<br> It's my little wedding gift<br> to you and what's-his-name.<br> What is his name?<br> Ken.<br> Ken! Right.<br> Ken.<br> I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.<br> No-- You know, it's just--<br> I- I-I heard about this...<br> for the first time, uh, today.<br> Uh, your getting remarried, that is.<br> And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.<br> Just... hard to believe.<br> I guess I thought maybe<br> there was still a chance...<br> for us somewhere down the road.<br> And I just, uh--<br> - Miles.<br> - Huh?<br> Maybe it is better<br> if you don't come to the wedding.<br> All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.<br> You're the boss.<br> Huh? I don't know.<br> Welcome back.<br> Take it easy.<br> - Are you okay, Miles?<br> - Yes. I'm fine.<br> Thank you.<br> - Excuse us, gentlemen.<br> - Excuse us.<br> Sure.<br> - Mmm.<br> - All right.<br> Yeah. Don't take too long.<br> - All right.<br> - Okay. Bye, girls.<br> What the fuck?<br> What is up with you?<br> - You remember our little talk outside?<br> - Yeah--<br> - Get your shit together, Miles.<br> - I'm fine. I'm fine.<br> Where were you?<br> Bathroom.<br> Did you drink and dial?<br> Hmm?<br> - No.<br> - Why do you always have to do this?<br> Victoria is gone. Gone.<br> Poof!. In the wind.<br> I mean, you are blowing a great<br> opportunity here with Maya.<br> Maya-- Fuckin' Maya-- She's great!<br> She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.<br> What is this morose, come-down bullshit?<br> These girls wanna party with us.<br> Huh?<br> And what was that 10-minute lecture<br> on, what, Vouvrays?<br> Are you kidding me?<br> Who gives a fuck?<br> Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable<br> with the whole scenario.<br> Have you forgotten all the bad times<br> you had with Victoria...<br> how small she could make you feel?<br> Isn't that why you had the affair<br> with Brenda in the first place?<br> Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.<br> Have you even noticed<br> how Maya's looking at you?<br> Now, come on, man.<br> You've got her on the hook.<br> Reel her in.<br> Let's ratchet this up a notch.<br> Here. Drink some agua fria.<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> - Mmm.<br> Ah. Well, so, uh,<br> shall we get some dessert?<br> Uh, well, we were thinking, um, uh,<br> why don't we go back to my place?<br> I've got wine, some insane cheeses,<br> music, whatever.<br> Yeah!<br> [Imitates Cat Snarling,<br> Continues Laughing]<br> - Waiter!<br> Come here.<br> Uh-huh.<br> - One for you, three for me.<br> - Mmm.<br> You sure you wanna do this?<br> #[Stereo: Female Singing<br> Mid-tempo Ballad]<br> - We're here!<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> - Where were you guys?<br> Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,<br> thanks to Magellan here.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Oh, Miles.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Maya's in the back, just past the kitchen.<br> - Okay.<br> - Thanks.<br> Hi.<br> Hey.<br> - Oh, has she got anything good?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.<br> - Hey, Steph!<br> - Yeah?<br> - Can we really open anything we want?<br> - Yeah, yeah. Anything.<br> Uh, except the Richebourg.<br> Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?<br> Holy mackerel.<br> I've completely<br> underestimated Stephanie.<br> Oh, good Lord. Um, look at that.<br> I think... this guy's more our speed.<br> Andrew Murray.<br> Well, okay. All right.<br> So, what gems do you have<br> in your collection?<br> Oh, it's really not much<br> of a collection, you know.<br> I mean, more like a small gathering<br> in a cabinet.<br> - No, I've never really had the wallet for that.<br> I just have to live bottle to bottle.<br> I've got things I'm saving, definitely.<br> I guess the star would be<br> a 1961 Cheval Blanc.<br> You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,<br> and it's just sitting there?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Go get it.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm serious! Hurry!<br> All right. I would, I would.<br> The '61 s are peaking right now, aren't they?<br> That's what I've read.<br> No, that's right, yeah.<br> It might be too late already.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> A special occasion with the right person.<br> - It was supposed to be for my 10th<br> wedding anniversary, but-- - Mmm.<br> You know, the day you open<br> a '61 Cheval Blanc...<br> that's the special occasion.<br> So, uh, how long<br> have you been into wine?<br> I got serious about seven years ago.<br> - And what was the bottle that did it?<br> - '88 Sassicaia.<br> - Ah! Well, congratulations.<br> - Mmm.<br> - Yeah.<br> - That's very good.<br> - Well--<br> - That would do it. Yeah.<br> Hmm.<br> Mmm.<br> Oh, wow, that's nice.<br> That's very good.<br> We need to give it a minute,<br> but that's really tasty.<br> How about you?<br> I think they overdid it a little.<br> Too much alcohol.<br> It overwhelms the fruit.<br> Huh.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> I'd say you're right on the money.<br> Very good. Nice.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Mmm.<br> Mmm! Is that Stephanie's kid?<br> Oh. Yeah. That's Siena.<br> - Oh, she's a sweetie.<br> - Cute. Cute.<br> Where is she?<br> - She's at her grandmother's.<br> - Oh.<br> Steph's mom.<br> She spends a lot of time over there.<br> You got kids?<br> Uh, me? No. No.<br> - No, I'd just fuck 'em up.<br> No, that was the one unpolluted part<br> of my divorce-- no kids.<br> Yeah. Same here.<br> Good.<br> Let's go in there.<br> Now, for a low, low<br> [Stephanie, Jack<br> Conversing, Indistinct]<br> Looks like our friends<br> are really hitting it off.<br> - Yeah, I would say that.<br> - Yeah.<br> - So, what's your novel about?<br> What's my-- Oh, brother.<br> Well, it's, uh--<br> it's difficult to summarize.<br> Um...<br> it starts out as a kind of<br> first-person narrative...<br> about a guy taking care<br> of his father after a stroke.<br> - Oh.<br> - It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.<br> But only-- only loosely.<br> What's the title?<br> The Day After Yesterday.<br> Oh. You mean today.<br> Um... uh, yeah.<br> I mean, r-right. But it's more--<br> So it's about, like,<br> death and mortality, or--<br> Uh, yeah--<br> Y-- Not really.<br> I, uh-- It de-- It jumps around a lot.<br> That's what it's about, in a way.<br> You know what I mean?<br> You start to see everything<br> from the point of view of the father.<br> And, uh, a lot of other things happen--<br> parallel narratives.<br> It's kind of a mess.<br> And then, eventually,<br> the whole thing sort of evolves...<br> or devolves...<br> into this sort of<br> Robbe-Grillet mystery.<br> You know?<br> But no real resolution.<br> - Wow.<br> - It--<br> Well, I think it's really great<br> you're getting it published.<br> Really. I mean, I know how hard it is<br> just to write it, even.<br> Yeah.<br> I mean, like me, I've got this paper<br> due on Friday...<br> and I'm freaked out about it,<br> just like in high school.<br> - A paper, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm going for a master's degree<br> in horticulture.<br> Sorta chipping away on it.<br> - Horticulture? Really?<br> - Mmm.<br> I didn't even know<br> that there was a college here.<br> Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo<br> twice a week.<br> Horticulture? Wow.<br> So, do you want to work<br> in a winery or something?<br> Maybe.<br> Oh.<br> Hmm.<br> So, when can I read your book?<br> Well, I-- You know, I-- Well, I do happen<br> to have a manuscript in my car.<br> Um, it's not proofed or anything...<br> so it's-- it's full of typos.<br> - If you don't mind typos--<br> - Oh, no. Who cares?<br> I'm the queen of typos.<br> Okay.<br> Mmm.<br> Ahh.<br> You know, can I ask you<br> a personal question, Miles?<br> Sure.<br> Why are you so into pinot?<br> - I mean, it's like a thing with you.<br> Uh... I don't know. I don't know.<br> Um... it's a hard grape to grow.<br> As you know. Right?<br> It's, uh-- It's thin-skinned...<br> temperamental, ripens early.<br> It's-- You know, it's not a survivor...<br> like cabernet...<br> which can just grow anywhere...<br> and thrive even when it's neglected.<br> No, pinot needs constant care<br> and attention. You know?<br> And, in fact, it can only grow...<br> in these really specific,<br> little tucked-away corners of the world.<br> And-- And only...<br> the most patient<br> and nurturing of growers...<br> can do it, really.<br> Only somebody<br> who really takes the time...<br> to understand pinot's potential...<br> can then coax it<br> into its fullest expression.<br> And then? I mean--<br> Oh, its flavours, they're just<br> the most haunting and brilliant...<br> and thrilling and subtle and...<br> ancient on the planet.<br> No, I mean, you know, cabernets<br> can be powerful and exalting too...<br> but they seem prosaic to me,<br> for some reason, by comparison.<br> - I don't know. I don't know.<br> What about you?<br> What about me?<br> I don't know.<br> Why are you into wine?<br> Oh, I-- I think I--<br> - I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.<br> - Ah.<br> You know, he had this big<br> sort of show-off cellar.<br> - You know?<br> - Right.<br> - But then I discovered that I had<br> a really sharp palate. - Mm-hmm.<br> And the more I drank...<br> the more I liked<br> what it made me think about.<br> Like what?<br> Like what a fraud he was.<br> Wow.<br> No, I mean, I like to think<br> about the life of wine.<br> Yeah.<br> How it's a living thing.<br> I like to think about...<br> what was going on the year<br> the grapes were growing...<br> how the sun was shining...<br> if it rained.<br> I like to think about...<br> all the people who tended<br> and picked the grapes...<br> and, if it's an old wine,<br> how many of them must be dead by now.<br> I like how wine continues to evolve.<br> Like,<br> if I opened a bottle of wine today...<br> it would taste different than if<br> I'd opened it on any other day.<br> Because a bottle of wine<br> is actually alive...<br> and it's constantly evolving<br> and gaining complexity.<br> That is, until it peaks...<br> like your '61.<br> And then it begins its steady...<br> inevitable decline.<br> Hmm.<br> And it tastes so fucking good.<br> Yeah.<br> But you know, I-- I, uh--<br> I like other wines besides pinot too.<br> I mean, lately<br> I've been really into Rieslings.<br> You like Rieslings? Rieslings?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> There's a bathroom in the back?<br> - Yeah. It's through the kitchen.<br> - I'll be right back.<br> God, you are such a fuckin' loser.<br> You make me so fuckin' sick.<br> Oh, God. Ah, come on.<br> Hi.<br> - I was just getting some water.<br> - Okay.<br> - You want some water?<br> - No.<br> Okay. It's getting kind of late.<br> I should really go.<br> So you know how to get to the Windmill?<br> Two rights and a left.<br> - Got it.<br> - Okay.<br> I had a nice time tonight, Miles.<br> I really did.<br> Good. So did I.<br> - Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.<br> - Um--<br> Did you still want to read my novel?<br> Oh, yeah. Of course.<br> Yeah.<br> - Great.<br> - Just a sec.<br> - Here.<br> - Oh, wow.<br> Well, I hope you like it.<br> And feel free to stop reading it any time.<br> I will not be offended.<br> Okay.<br> - Well, good night, Miles.<br> - Good night.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.<br> Unbelievable!<br> Whoo! Boy.<br> Ohh, she is nasty, Miles.<br> Nasty, nasty, nasty!<br> - Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.<br> - Yeah, baby.<br> Congratulations.<br> Mission accomplished.<br> Oh, hi, Miles!<br> Hi.<br> - Hey, you didn't invite Stephanie to come with us, did you?<br> Oh, listen, man. Change of plans.<br> Stephanie's off today, so, you know,<br> I'm thinkin' about goin' on a hike.<br> We were supposed to play golf.<br> You know what? You go, man.<br> You go. In fact, use my clubs.<br> - They're brand-new. They were a gift<br> from Christine's dad.<br> Here, I'll pay for it. Right there.<br> And then later, the three of us,<br> we can go to The Hitching Post.<br> We could sit at one of Maya's tables.<br> She'll bring us some great wine,<br> you know?<br> - Then the four of us will do something.<br> - No. Count me out.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Didn't go so great last night, huh?<br> What a shocker.<br> You mean getting drunk and calling<br> Victoria didn't put you in the mood?<br> Dumb fuck.<br> - Later, man.<br> - Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.<br> - Oh, boy.<br> Yeah, she's been leaving<br> messages here too.<br> Yeah. Okay.<br> - You should call her.<br> - I will. I'll see you.<br> - Right now!<br> - Okay. Fuck!<br> - What are you, my mom?<br> - Well.<br> Would you mind waiting outside?<br> - That was fun last night.<br> - Yeah. Good food.<br> Hey, I-I talked to Maya this morning.<br> She said she had a fun time too.<br> You should call her.<br> - Where's Jack?<br> - Uh, had to make a phone call.<br> Oh.<br> Miles. Miles.<br> Hey, man, uh, do you have<br> that other condom?<br> In my jacket.<br> What did, uh, Christine say?<br> Lucked out. Got voice mail.<br> Everything's cool.<br> - Ha, ha! Here I am.<br> - Hi!<br> - Ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> Cannonball!<br> Please dial your password and press pound.<br> You have no messages at this time.<br> To send a message, press 2--<br> - Uh--<br> Not now. Not now!<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, there you are.<br> - Yup.<br> - Hey, man.<br> What are you drinking?<br> Is it any good?<br> Can-- Can I get a glass, please?<br> Thanks.<br> Stephanie took me out<br> to the pinot fields today, Miles.<br> God, it was so awesome.<br> I think I'm really starting to get<br> a handle on the whole process.<br> The soil to the vine, and the--<br> what do you call it?<br> The selection to the harvest.<br> Then that thing they do with<br> the big containers where they mix it?<br> It's really neat, the whole thing.<br> Then we ate pinot grapes<br> right off the vine.<br> They were a little sour...<br> but showing excellent potential<br> for structure...<br> down the line, I think.<br> Stephanie, man.<br> She really knows her shit.<br> Hmm. Where is Stephanie?<br> Uh, she's upstairs cleaning up.<br> What the fuck are you doing?<br> - What?<br> - With this chick.<br> What?<br> Does she know about Saturday?<br> Well, not exactly.<br> I've been honest with her.<br> I haven't told her I'm available.<br> She knows this trip<br> is only for a few days.<br> Besides, I just--<br> - Besides what?<br> - I'm-- Well, you know--<br> - The wedding.<br> - What?<br> I-- I've just been doing<br> some thinking about it.<br> Oh, you've been thinking. And?<br> Might have to put<br> the wedding on hold, is all.<br> Look, I know that<br> that could be tricky...<br> - for certain people to accept at first.<br> - Yeah.<br> All right?<br> But life is short, Miles.<br> I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing<br> before taking such a big step.<br> You know what?<br> That's not just for my sake.<br> I'm looking out<br> for Christine's feelings too.<br> I mean, being with Stephanie<br> has completely opened my eyes.<br> She's not uptight or controlling.<br> She's just cool.<br> I mean, she smells different,<br> she tastes different.<br> - She fucks different.<br> - Okay.<br> She fucks like an animal.<br> I gotta tell you, man.<br> I went deep last night.<br> Deep.<br> Deep.<br> I thought I'd get a little understanding<br> from you, but I'm not gonna get that.<br> Understanding about what, Jack?<br> - I might be in love with another woman.<br> In love? Really?<br> Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer<br> chick, and you're fuckin' in love.<br> Come on! And you're gonna<br> give up everything?<br> Here's what I'm thinkin'.<br> You and me, we move up here,<br> we buy a vineyard.<br> You design the wine.<br> I'll handle the business side.<br> You get inspired, maybe write<br> another novel, one that can sell.<br> Oh, my God. No, no.<br> As for me, if an audition comes up,<br> L.A.'s right there, man.<br> - It's two hours away. Not even.<br> - Jesus Christ. You're crazy.<br> You've gone crazy.<br> All I know is that I'm an actor.<br> All I have is my instinct.<br> You're asking me to go against it.<br> Hi, guys!<br> Hi. Hi.<br> - We should probably get going.<br> - Yeah.<br> Where?<br> I know where all the drivers go.<br> Huh? All right. Here comes the tricky part.<br> There you go. Nice.<br> Nice. Okay, it's the bridge.<br> Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.<br> You know, it's a thing-- I mean,<br> I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Stephanie's heard this a thousand times...<br> but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria<br> when I had a chance...<br> I would've made a fortune<br> when they put in that, uh--<br> - Home Depot.<br> - Home Depot.<br> And those stores.<br> And your father knew about it too.<br> He's such a fuckin' chickenshit.<br> Always was.<br> Just a fuckin' chickenshit.<br> - Just too scared.<br> - Is this bothering you? You sure?<br> - It's fine. Yeah.<br> Hey, man. I'm gonna just make sure<br> that Siena and Stephanie get home safe.<br> - Okay.<br> - All right. Maybe we'll hook up with you later.<br> Sure. Whatever. Maybe I'll<br> go catch a movie or something.<br> - See you later, Miles.<br> - Thanks, Stephanie. See you.<br> - Bye, Siena.<br> - Bye.<br> - Caryl, very nice meeting you.<br> - I loved talking with you.<br> - Thanks.<br> - If you go out later, call me on my cell.<br> Okay!<br> - Okay. That's it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Actually, could I get a, uh--<br> a Barely Legal, please?<br> Thank you. No, actually--<br> Sorry. The new one.<br> Okay.<br> Thanks.<br> What-- Oh.<br> - Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?<br> - Hey.<br> Oh, you know me. I love it up here.<br> - How 'bout you?<br> - Busy for a Tuesday night.<br> We had a busload of old folks<br> on a wine tour.<br> Usually they're not too rowdy,<br> but tonight something was going on.<br> I don't know. A full moon or something.<br> Anyway, what can I get you?<br> - Highliner.<br> - Glass or bottle?<br> - Bottle.<br> - You got it.<br> Say, is, uh, Maya working?<br> Maya? Uh, no, I haven't seen her.<br> I think she's off tonight.<br> - You okay, Miles?<br> - Yeah, I'm good.<br> Ah, crap.<br> - Did you ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?<br> - Nope.<br> - Hmm?<br> - No.<br> She really likes you, man.<br> Stephanie'll tell you.<br> - Could you just give me a little room? Please?<br> - Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> In life, you gotta strike<br> while the iron's hot. Iron is hot.<br> Sage advice, Jack.<br> - Now, remember, sit back on your heels.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> All right?<br> Turn through the abdomen.<br> Abdomen.<br> - Oh, for cryin'--<br> - Nice.<br> What about your agent?<br> You hear anything yet?<br> - Nope.<br> - What do you think's going on?<br> - Could be anything.<br> - You been checking your messages?<br> - Obsessively.<br> - Huh.<br> Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss off<br> another three years of my life.<br> But you haven't heard anything yet...<br> so don't you think your negativity's<br> a little premature?<br> Hmm? All right. You know,<br> fuck the New York publishers.<br> Publish it yourself, Miles.<br> I'll chip in.<br> Just get it out there.<br> Get it reviewed.<br> Get it in libraries.<br> Let the public decide.<br> Don't come over the top.<br> - Stay still.<br> - Shut up.<br> It's all about stillness.<br> - Inner quiet.<br> - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!<br> Jesus Christ, man!<br> What the hell is wrong with you?<br> Please, just shut up! Fuck!<br> - God.<br> - What's with the hostility, man?<br> I know you're a little frustrated<br> with your life right now...<br> - but you can choose to be less hostile.<br> The fucker hit into us.<br> Hurry it up, will ya?<br> Oh, boy. Oh, boy.<br> Hey, that's not cool, asshole!<br> Nice shot. Jackoffs.<br> - What the hell are you doing?<br> - Oops. Look out.<br> Uh? Uh-huh.<br> Oh. Oh, check it out.<br> - This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.<br> - Go to it.<br> Just don't give up on Maya. Cool, smart<br> chicks like that require persistence.<br> I don't wanna talk about it, please.<br> All I know is that she's beautiful,<br> a lot of soul.<br> She's perfect for you.<br> I'm just not gonna feel good about this week<br> until I know you guys have hooked up.<br> Don't you want to feel that cozy little box<br> grip down on your Johnson?<br> Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?<br> A woman finds out how I live...<br> that I'm not a published author,<br> that I'm a liar, essentially...<br> any interest she has<br> is gonna evaporate real quick.<br> If you don't have money at my age,<br> you're not even in the game anymore.<br> You're just a pasture animal<br> waiting for the abattoir.<br> - Abattoir. What is that?<br> - Slaughterhouse.<br> Abattoir. Huh.<br> But you know what?<br> You are gonna be<br> a published author...<br> because you're gonna get the good news<br> this week about your book.<br> - I know you are. I can feel it.<br> Huh. Stephanie.<br> Hey, honey. Yeah.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Yeah!<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped by<br> the restaurant to see me last night.<br> Oh, yeah. No. I mean, uh, yeah.<br> I stopped by for a drink.<br> I didn't see you.<br> - I had class.<br> - Oh.<br> Well, nice to see you now.<br> It's good to see you too.<br> - Syrah.<br> Oldest Syrah grapes<br> in Santa Barbara County.<br> Did you know that?<br> You didn't know that?<br> The pinot noir grape<br> has been cultivated perhaps...<br> since antiquity in Burgundy.<br> And it is precisely this ancient...<br> and inherited winemaking<br> knowledge...<br> that has contributed to its success.<br> - I was, like, 16, 17.<br> - Really?<br> Yeah. I'm gonna die!<br> - Oh, God. What a drag.<br> - Mom?<br> - Oh.<br> - Oh, hey. Hi.<br> - Is it too loud?<br> Sorry. Oh, Uncle Jack<br> will put you back to bed.<br> Come here, little sister. Ooh!<br> We'll be more quiet, okay?<br> - Good night. I'm sorry.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - My favourite, as far as ice cream--<br> - Chunky Monkey.<br> - Chunky Monkey!<br> - Chunky Monkey.<br> - Chunky Monkey!<br> You guys should come by<br> the restaurant for lunch today.<br> - Great. What's the latest we can get there?<br> - About 2:30.<br> Did you hear about this Bordeaux<br> tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara...<br> on Saturday night?<br> It's kind of pricey,<br> but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.<br> Why don't you just stay<br> for the weekend?<br> No, we have to get back Friday<br> for the rehearsal dinner.<br> What rehearsal dinner?<br> Who's getting married?<br> - Were you ever gonna say anything?<br> - Yes, of course I was.<br> Just now I could've told you<br> some story, but I didn't.<br> - I told you the truth. Maya!<br> - Don't touch me!<br> Just take me home.<br> Do you have any idea<br> what he's been saying to her?<br> - He's an actor, so it can't be good.<br> - Only that he loves her.<br> How she's the only woman that's ever<br> rocked his world, how he adores Siena...<br> how he wants to move here and get a place with<br> the two of them and commute when he has to.<br> I'm sure he believed every word of it.<br> Please believe me.<br> I was on the verge<br> of telling you last night, but--<br> But you wanted to fuck me first.<br> Oh, Maya. No.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, I've just spent<br> the last three years of my life...<br> trying to extricate myself from<br> a relationship that was full of deception...<br> and I'm doing just fine.<br> And I haven't been with anybody<br> since my divorce...<br> so this has been a big deal for me,<br> Maya.<br> Hanging out with you and, uh--<br> and last night.<br> I really like you, Maya...<br> and I am not Jack.<br> I'm-- I'm--<br> I'm his freshman year roommate<br> from San Diego State.<br> - There's my boy!<br> There he is.<br> But who's your daddy?<br> - Who is your daddy? Oh!<br> - Jack, come on.<br> - Oh, let me love you.<br> - Let go. Oh!<br> - Let me down, Jack.<br> I am so proud of you.<br> Ah. Mmm. Mmm.<br> - Well, that's nice.<br> - Okay. All right. Details.<br> - I love details.<br> - No.<br> - What?<br> - Jesus. It's private.<br> You better tell me what happened,<br> or I'll tie your dick in a knot.<br> Let's just leave it, okay?<br> - You didn't get any, did you?<br> - You're a homo.<br> - Yeah, right. Yup, I'm a homo.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Just make up whatever you want,<br> and that's what happened.<br> Write out my gay confession,<br> and I'll sign it.<br> Okay? Just stop pushing me<br> all the time.<br> You're an infant, Jack.<br> - This is all a big party for you...<br> - Okay.<br> - but not for me.<br> - Come on.<br> I'm sorry, man.<br> Did you have trouble performing?<br> - Yeah, that's it.<br> - Don't answer it.<br> Don't answer it.<br> - Jack.<br> - Hello.<br> Yeah.<br> Uh-huh. It's Christine.<br> Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.<br> Hey, let me call you right back.<br> Miles and I are kinda<br> in the middle of something.<br> Nah, it's nothing serious. Just--<br> He's having one of his freak-outs. Yeah.<br> - I love you too. I'll call you back.<br> This whole week has gone sour.<br> It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.<br> I just want to go home.<br> I know what you need.<br> I know what you need.<br> How 'bout this one?<br> We didn't hit this one.<br> - Frass Canyon. It's a joke.<br> - You ever actually been in there?<br> - I don't have to.<br> - I say we check it out. We're right here.<br> It tastes like the back<br> of a fucking L.A. school bus.<br> Now, they probably didn't de-stem...<br> hoping for some semblance<br> of concentration.<br> Crushed it up with leaves and mice...<br> and then wound up with this rancid tar<br> and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.<br> Fuckin' Raid.<br> Tastes pretty good to me.<br> Hmm. Look.<br> They have a reserve pinot.<br> - Let me use your phone.<br> - What's up?<br> - I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.<br> - Okay.<br> Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.<br> - Hi, Jennifer. It's Miles again.<br> - Oh, hi, Miles.<br> - Hi.<br> - Let me see if I can get her.<br> Okay.<br> - You're in luck. I'll put you through.<br> - Okay.<br> - Hi, Miles.<br> - Hi, Evelyn.<br> It's your favourite client.<br> - How's the trip?<br> - Oh, it's good, it's good.<br> You know, we're drinking<br> some good wines, kicking back.<br> - It's very nice.<br> - Right.<br> So what's happening?<br> There's still no word, huh?<br> Well, actually, there is word.<br> I spoke to Keith Kurtzman<br> this morning.<br> Right. And?<br> And... they're passing.<br> Conundrum's passing.<br> He said they really liked it.<br> They really wanted to do it, but they just<br> couldn't figure out how to market it.<br> He said it was a really tough call.<br> Oh. Right.<br> - I'm sorry, Miles.<br> So I don't know where that leaves us.<br> I'm not sure how much more mileage<br> I can get out of continuing to submit it.<br> I think it's one of those unfortunate cases<br> in the business right now--<br> a- a fabulous book with no home.<br> The whole industry's gotten gutless.<br> It's not about the quality<br> of the books anymore.<br> It's only about the marketing.<br> - Excuse me. Could I get a, uh, pour down here, please?<br> - Sure.<br> There's a, uh, special<br> on the Syrah by the case.<br> Hit me again.<br> Thanks.<br> Excuse me.<br> Could you just pour me a full glass?<br> I'll pay for it, okay?<br> Sir, this is a winery, not a bar.<br> Oh. Come on.<br> Just give me a full goddamn pour.<br> Excuse me.<br> Why don't you buy a bottle,<br> then go outside?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I told you I need a drink, so I'm going to help myself.<br> - Okay, pal? What do you think?<br> - Put the glass down.<br> Let go of the fucking glass, fucker!<br> - Mmm.<br> - That's that.<br> - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.<br> - It's okay.<br> - Get him out of here.<br> - Thanks a lot!<br> - It's okay. His, uh-- His mother just died.<br> So you'll write another one.<br> You've got lots of ideas, right?<br> No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.<br> I'm a middle school English teacher.<br> Ah, the world doesn't give a shit<br> what I have to say.<br> I'm unnecessary.<br> I'm so insignificant,<br> I can't even kill myself.<br> Miles, what the hell<br> is that supposed to mean?<br> Come on, man. You know.<br> Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.<br> You can't kill yourself<br> before you've even been published.<br> - What about the guy that wrote Confederacy Of Dunces?<br> He committed suicide before he<br> was published. Look how famous he is.<br> Thanks.<br> Just don't give up. All right?<br> You're gonna make it.<br> Half my life is over...<br> and I have nothing<br> to show for it, nothing.<br> I'm a thumbprint<br> on the window of a skyscraper.<br> I'm a smudge of excrement<br> on a tissue...<br> surging out to sea<br> with a million tons of raw sewage.<br> See? Right there.<br> Just what you just said?<br> That is beautiful.<br> "A smudge of excrement<br> surging out to sea."<br> - Yeah.<br> - I could never write that.<br> Neither could I, actually.<br> I think it's Bukowski.<br> Hey, baby.<br> - Look what I got for our favourite girl.<br> - Motherfucker!<br> - Jesus Christ!<br> - You fucking lying piece of shit!<br> You're getting married on Saturday?<br> What's with all that shit you said to me?<br> - Stephanie, stop!<br> - I can explain!<br> - You said you loved me!<br> - I do!<br> - I hope you die!<br> - Stop it, Stephanie!<br> Fuckface! You too!<br> Me?<br> - You fucking told Maya, didn't you?<br> - No, I did not.<br> No, I did not.<br> It must have been Gary<br> at The Hitching Post.<br> I think we mentioned it to him<br> the first night.<br> Oh, did we mention it?<br> You mentioned it, asshole!<br> I'm fucking hurting over here.<br> Keep it elevated.<br> No, I don't want anything.<br> - Uh, it's Miles.<br> I had to call and, uh, tell you again...<br> how much I enjoyed<br> our time together...<br> and, uh, how sorry I am...<br> that things turned out<br> the way they did.<br> I think you're great, Maya.<br> Uh, I always have from the first time<br> that you, uh, waited on me.<br> Uh, and while I'm at it...<br> uh, I guess maybe you<br> should know that my book...<br> is not getting published.<br> I thought this one, uh, had a chance,<br> but I was wrong again.<br> Once again.<br> So you see, uh...<br> I'm not really much of a writer.<br> I am not much of anything, really.<br> I'm gonna have to have an operation,<br> maybe even a couple of 'em.<br> They're gonna wait for my nose to heal first,<br> then they break it again.<br> Oh, Christ. Good thing<br> you have a voice-over career.<br> It's gonna fuck that up too.<br> I oughta sue her ass.<br> The only reason I won't<br> is to protect Christine.<br> - That's thoughtful.<br> - Yeah.<br> How did Stephanie know<br> it was on Saturday?<br> We didn't get into that with Gary.<br> Huh. That's-- Yeah, let me think.<br> - You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?<br> - Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.<br> And just what are you implying, Jack?<br> I'm really pissed off at you about all this,<br> if you want to know the truth.<br> What is Maya going to think of me now,<br> just for associating with you?<br> I don't know. Sure seems fishy.<br> Well.<br> Wherever there's a fight<br> so hungry people can eat...<br> I'll be there.<br> Wherever there's a cop<br> beating up a guy...<br> I'll be there.<br> I'll be in the way guys yell<br> when they're mad.<br> What's this look like to you?<br> Uh, it looks like you were<br> in a bad car accident.<br> When the people<br> are eating the stuff they raised--<br> I'm hungry.<br> - Here we go.<br> - Nice.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And here is your Handi Wipes.<br> - Oh.<br> So that's what those are. For a minute<br> I thought you were promoting safe sex.<br> That's a good one.<br> I'll have to remember that one.<br> - I'll be right back with your corn bread.<br> - All righty.<br> Bet you that chick's two tons of fun.<br> - You know, the grateful type?<br> - Mm-mmm.<br> I don't know.<br> I wouldn't know about that.<br> Mmm.<br> - Hmm.<br> - Here you go.<br> Nice technique there... Cammi.<br> Thank you. All in the wrist.<br> You know,<br> you look really familiar to me.<br> - Are you from around here?<br> - Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?<br> I don't know.<br> You just seemed really familiar to me.<br> - Never mind. Enjoy your meal.<br> - Hang on. Hang on.<br> Um, did you ever know<br> a Derek Sommersby?<br> Dr. Derek Sommersby<br> from One Life To Live?<br> Just have to imagine him<br> with a bandage and shorter hair.<br> No way!<br> No way! Oh, my gosh!<br> That's great! Oh, my goodness!<br> Could you tell me where<br> the bathroom is, please?<br> Oh, yeah. It's right over there,<br> right past the buffalo. Wow!<br> Oh, my gosh. I can't believe<br> you're sitting at my table.<br> Listen, man, Cammi gets off<br> in an hour, so I was thinking...<br> I'd just hang around, have a drink.<br> - You know, make sure she gets home safe.<br> You're joking, right?<br> No.<br> Un-fucking-believable.<br> Can't we just go back to the motel<br> and hang out...<br> get up early,<br> play nine holes of golf...<br> before we head home?<br> Listen, man, you're my friend...<br> and I know you care about me.<br> I know you disapprove,<br> and I respect that.<br> But there are some things that I have to do<br> that you don't understand.<br> You understand literature,<br> movies, wine...<br> but you don't understand my plight.<br> Yeah?<br> - Holy shit! Jesus Christ!<br> - Fuck. Fuck.<br> God, it's fucking freezing out there!<br> - God, yeah.<br> - Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin?<br> Uh--<br> Oh.<br> Here.<br> Oh. Oh.<br> Fucking chick's married, man.<br> What?<br> Her husband works the night shift, and he<br> comes home and catches me on the floor...<br> with my cock in his wife's ass.<br> Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus. Jack!<br> - And you walked all the way from Solvang?<br> - No, ran.<br> Twisted my ankle too.<br> - That's five klicks, Jack.<br> - Fuckin'- A right, it's five klicks.<br> At one point I had to cut<br> through an ostrich farm.<br> - Those fuckers are mean.<br> Whoo!<br> - Oh!<br> - We gotta go back.<br> What?<br> We gotta go back. I left my wallet.<br> Credit cards, cash, my fucking I.D.<br> - Everything. We gotta go back.<br> - Big deal. It's fine.<br> Don't worry about it. We'll call now<br> and we'll cancel your cards.<br> No, Miles, you don't understand.<br> The wedding rings.<br> The wedding rings are in my wallet.<br> Fine, they're in your wallet, and you<br> left your wallet in some bar, okay?<br> - Christine will understand.<br> - She had to order them special.<br> It took her forever to find 'em.<br> They've got this design of dolphins<br> and our names engraved in Sanskrit.<br> We gotta go back, man.<br> Christine will fucking crucify me, Miles.<br> No way, no way, no way.<br> Please. Please!<br> Forget it.<br> Your wallet was stolen in some bar.<br> - It happens every day.<br> - No, we gotta go back and get my wallet, Miles.<br> I'm telling you,<br> those rings are irreplaceable.<br> Look, I know I fucked up, okay?<br> I know I fucked up.<br> - But you've gotta help me.<br> - Yeah.<br> You've gotta help me, Miles,<br> please! Please!<br> I can't lose Christine, Miles.<br> I just-- I can't.<br> I can't lose Christine.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - I know I fucked up.<br> I know I did a bad thing, all right?<br> And I know I'm a bad person.<br> I know I am. But you gotta help me!<br> You have to help me, Miles.<br> Okay? Tell me you'll help me.<br> If I lose Christine, I-I-I--<br> I'm nothing.<br> I just have-- I'm nothing.<br> God.<br> - Did she tell you she was married?<br> - Yeah.<br> So what the fuck were you thinking?<br> Wasn't supposed to be back till 6:00.<br> Fucker rolls in at 5:00.<br> Cutting it a little close, don't you think?<br> - This is the block.<br> - You sure?<br> Yeah.<br> That's it. That's it.<br> That's the one right there.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> All right.<br> Okay, so what's the plan?<br> Uh, the plan is...<br> you go.<br> - Me?<br> - 'Cause of my ankle.<br> Still hurts. Just go explain<br> the situation, Miles.<br> Explain the situation. Yes.<br> "Excuse me, sir. My friend was the one<br> balling your wife a couple of hours ago.<br> "Really sorry. He seems to<br> have left his wallet behind.<br> I was wondering if I could come in<br> and just poke around. I don't know."<br> - Yeah, just like that. That's good.<br> - Oh, for Christ's sake.<br> Oh, fuck it! I'll go.<br> I guess I have to do everything.<br> No. Hold on.<br> You think I don't fuck you, bitch?<br> I'm fucking you now.<br> I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl!<br> You picked him up and you fucked him,<br> didn't you, bitch?<br> Yeah, I picked him up and I fucked him.<br> I'm a bad girl!<br> You liked fucking him,<br> didn't you, you little whore?<br> I liked it when you caught me fucking him!<br> Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!<br> You are a bad bitch.<br> - Yeah, you caught me.<br> - You're such a whore.<br> Oh, yeah!<br> - Oh, baby.<br> - Oh, it's so good!<br> I fucked him.<br> - You're so bad.<br> - I am. Yeah.<br> You are such a whore.<br> - What the fuck!<br> - The wallet! He's got Derek's wallet!<br> I think they<br> were surprised by the level of protest...<br> that was really happening<br> within the company.<br> The injustice may be their plan,<br> and they said, "Well, we cant just go-- "<br> - Oh! Here's your wallet! Oh, shit!<br> - Motherfucker!<br> - Open the goddamn door!<br> - I'm gonna kill your ass!<br> - You got it! You got my wallet!<br> I'll find you! I will find you, bub!<br> I'll find your ass!<br> You're mine, man! You're mine!<br> Fuck you! I'm gonna get your ass!<br> - You wanna let me drive?<br> - No, it's all right. I got it.<br> Hey, you know, you oughta<br> invite Maya to the wedding.<br> Hmm.<br> Somehow I think<br> inviting Maya to the wedding...<br> is not the right move<br> at this juncture.<br> I don't know.<br> In fact,<br> after all of your shenanigans...<br> it's gonna be hard for me<br> to ever go to The Hitching Post again.<br> You know, there was a nice way<br> to respond to that.<br> - Come on. Let me drive.<br> - No, I got it. You should rest.<br> You know what? I feel like driving.<br> Okay.<br> Uh... hey, put on your seat belt, okay?<br> I was just about to.<br> What's the problem?<br> - Just want to remind you to be safe.<br> - We missed the entrance.<br> What are you doing, Jack?<br> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<br> - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?<br> - Hang on.<br> Jack!<br> What the fuck!<br> - You said it looked like an accident.<br> - What the fuck!<br> I'll pay for it.<br> Jesus. Christ, Jack!<br> Oh, for Ch-- Look at this!<br> - Huh.<br> - Oh.<br> I don't know.<br> Doesn't look like anyone<br> was injured in this one.<br> No. No.<br> - Watch your head.<br> - Yeah.<br> Boy, you broke a couple of em,<br> you know.<br> - Whatever. Sorry.<br> - No, no, no. It's not "whatever."<br> You fuckin' derelict.<br> You ready?<br> Just get it over with.<br> Okeydoke. All right.<br> Well, I guess that's about it.<br> - Want to come inside?<br> - Uh, no. No, you're on your own.<br> All right. I guess<br> I'll see you at the rehearsal.<br> Yup.<br> - I love you, man.<br> Yeah. Back at ya.<br> - Miles, don't drive away until they see the car.<br> - I know, I know, I know.<br> Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.<br> How come I wasn't hurt?<br> 'Cause you were wearing your seat belt.<br> Nicely done.<br> - Hi.<br> - Jack.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Uh, Christine, Mike!<br> Amen.<br> Hey, Miles.<br> Hi, Vicki.<br> Wow, you look beautiful.<br> Thanks.<br> Um, this is Ken Cortland,<br> my husband.<br> - How are you?<br> - How are you?<br> - Good, thanks.<br> - Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.<br> - You're a lucky guy.<br> - Yes, I am. Thank you.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.<br> - It was great meeting you, Miles.<br> - Ken.<br> - Well, that was big of him.<br> - Yeah, he's good that way.<br> - He's very considerate.<br> - That's great.<br> So how are you doing?<br> Since the last time we spoke?<br> I don't know.<br> Could be better. Could be worse.<br> - So what's happening with your book?<br> - Um, universally rejected.<br> - Strike three.<br> - Oh, Miles, that's awful.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> Back to the drawing board,<br> I guess. Or not.<br> I don't know.<br> So, anyway, you're married.<br> Congratulations. You look happy.<br> - I am.<br> - Good.<br> Seems like everybody's getting married.<br> Last year was all divorces.<br> This year it's all weddings.<br> - Cyclical, I guess.<br> - I guess.<br> Well, uh, what do you say<br> we hit the reception?<br> Have some champagne,<br> toast the newlyweds, huh?<br> Not me. I'm not drinking.<br> You quit drinking. Really?<br> I'm pregnant.<br> I see.<br> Yes, I see. Great.<br> Well, congratulations again, Vicki.<br> Boy, that's wonderful news.<br> - See you over there, Miles?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hmm.<br> "'The marrow of his bone, '<br> I repeated aimlessly.<br> "This, at last, penetrated my mind.<br> "Phineas had died<br> from the marrow of his bone...<br> "flowing down his bloodstream<br> to his heart.<br> "I did not cry then or ever about Finny.<br> "I did not cry even when I stood...<br> "watching him being lowered into<br> his family's strait-laced burial ground...<br> "outside of Boston.<br> "I could not escape the feeling<br> that this was my own funeral...<br> and you do not cry in that case. "<br> Should I keep reading<br> the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?<br> Uh, no, no.<br> We'll pick up there Monday.<br> One new message.<br> Hello, Miles. It's Maya.<br> Thanks for your letter.<br> I- I would have called sooner...<br> but I think I needed some time to think<br> about everything that happened...<br> and what you wrote to me.<br> Another reason, um,<br> I didn't call you sooner...<br> is because I wanted to finish your book,<br> which I finally did last night.<br> And I think it's really lovely, Miles.<br> You're so good with words.<br> Who cares<br> if it's not getting published?<br> There are so many beautiful<br> and... painful things about it.<br> Did you really go through all that?<br> Must have been awful.<br> And the sister character--<br> geez, what a wreck.<br> But I have to say that, well,<br> I was really confused by the ending.<br> I mean, did the father<br> finally commit suicide, or what?<br> It's driving me crazy.<br> Anyway...<br> it's turned cold and rainy here lately...<br> but I like winter.<br> So, listen, if you ever do decide to come<br> up here again, you should let me know.<br> I would say stop by the restaurant,<br> but to tell you the truth...<br> I'm not sure how much longer<br> I'm gonna be working there...<br> because I'm going to graduate soon.<br> So I'll probably want to relocate.<br> I mean, we'll see.<br> Anyway, like I said,<br> I really loved your novel.<br> Don't give up, Miles.<br> Keep writing.<br> I hope you're well.<br> Bye.<br>
