Sundays?<br> I love Sundays.<br> I live for Sundays.<br> The whole family's together.<br> Mom makes braciole.<br> Dad puts the Jersey on.<br> We're all watching the game. Yeah,<br> it drives me crazy, and yes,<br> I was negative. You didn't even know<br> that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.<br> I just didn't appreciate<br> it, or you, before.".<br> Come on. Time to go.<br> I lost all that. I blew it.<br> But you also blew it.<br> We can get it back.<br> We're gonna get it back. It's<br> all gonna be better now.<br> I'm better now and I hope you are, too.<br> And I'm gonna appreciate...".<br> Hey, I'll be there<br> in a minute, okay?<br> Doctor's waiting.<br> Let's go.<br> I'll be there in a minute.<br> That's true love.<br> Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People<br> say I talk about my hair too much.<br> And it was just the way I wanted<br> it, but he cut it back too far.<br> He cut this side back too<br> far trying to even it up.<br> I didn't tell him to do that.<br> I said, "just cut it the<br> way you cut it...".<br> Once you get in the right frame of<br> mind, I think anything's possible.<br> I think we get, we so often get caught<br> in this state of negativity and<br> it's a, it's a poison<br> like nothing else.<br> Dr. timbers:... technically, you can<br> take him out against our recommendation,<br> but you assume a lot of liability<br> in the eyes of the court.<br> And he's just getting<br> used to the routine here.<br> I don't want him to get<br> used to the routine here.<br> Eight months is<br> already long enough.<br> Hey, mom. Can we give Danny<br> a ride to north Philly?<br> What? I don't understand.<br> Mom, no, it'll be fine.<br> It'll be fine.<br> I guess everybody's<br> leaving today!<br> Hello, Mrs. s. An honor<br> to finally meet you.<br> Pat told me all about you,<br> how God made you rich in character,<br> and you're the mighty oak that holds<br> the household together, and not to<br> mention the lasagna you make on game day<br> when the birds play.<br> Danny was in for assault because<br> of crystal meth and alcohol.<br> Bad combination.<br> Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.<br> That was when I was an X-ray<br> technician with my add and my anxiety.<br> I had a lot of access to<br> medication and I took advantage of it.<br> That's when my hair was long, too.<br> But my hair only grew when I was older.<br> When I was younger, my<br> hair didn't grow<br> because my brother...<br> Remember I told you about my<br> brother, he had a jheri curl, and<br> I couldn't get a jheri curl because<br> my hair didn't grow long enough.<br> I was so jealous<br> of my brother...<br> But wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> Hello?<br> Yeah! It looks great now.<br> You like it?<br> No, it's good now.<br> Yes, it is.<br> Wait, you're going<br> the wrong way!<br> What? Are you sure about that?<br> I'll bring him back right away.<br> You lied to me, pat. Danny's<br> not allowed to leave.<br> All right, mom,<br> just hold on a sec.<br> Let's just talk<br> about this.<br> Mom, just listen...<br> Don't tou-...<br> Ch the steering... wheel!<br> Pat, this whole thing<br> was a mistake.<br> I'm sorry, mom. You okay?<br> I am out on a limb for you<br> with the courts right now.<br> It's my fault. Pat didn't know.<br> Pat didn't know. He's my friend,<br> so he was rootin' for me. I'm havin'<br> a disagreement with the hospital,<br> but we're working it out.<br> Take me back to the hospital,<br> but take pat home, he's fine.<br> Trust me. You'll see,<br> he's fine. It's my fault.<br> Mom, can we stop at the library?<br> I wanna read.<br> Nikki's entire English<br> high school syllabus.<br> Mom, it's a good thing.<br> I'm remaking myself.<br> Desean Jackson. What<br> happened to desean Jackson?<br> Come on, tell me that one.<br> It's insanity. He spikes the<br> ball at the one yard line.<br> The one fucking-yard line.<br> I mean, get into the<br> end zone, dummy.<br> You know something? It's nothing new.<br> Your team does that all the time.<br> They get close... and then they blow it.<br> They got an inferiority complex.<br> Wait a minute, what are you talking about?<br> What makes the cowboys America's team?<br> Because we are, we're<br> America's team.<br> You should be ashamed of yourself.<br> We're in Philadelphia,<br> what's the matter with you?<br> You're a fucking traitor.<br> What's more American<br> than a cowboy?<br> You know what's more American?<br> What?<br> Benjamin Franklin, that's<br> what's more American.<br> Benjamin Franklin?<br> Benjamin Franklin. The founder of<br> our country, here in Philadelphia.<br> You mean the guy with the... little<br> glasses and the long scraggly hair?<br> What about the lightning with the kite?<br> He stood in the storm with a kite.<br> If he wasn't on the hundred<br> dollar bill, nobody...<br> Would even know who he is.<br> What are you doing? No, no, no, no.<br> Don't touch them, don't touch them.<br> I didn't even touch 'em. Why<br> are you..., don't blame me.<br> Who did this? Who took,<br> who took, who took the...<br> The remotes like this?<br> Did you do this, Randy?<br> No, I don't touch them. As a matter of<br> fact, I don't know why you need so many.<br> Hey, there she is!<br> Look how beautiful!<br> What!! Whats this?<br> Everything good? Mm-hmm.<br> Ahh.<br> Where is it?<br> It's right here.<br> You got it. Ahh, well, we got that.<br> We don't want them to steal that.<br> You still got yours?<br> Yeah, I got mine.<br> So what, you don't talk to me? You<br> didn't tell me you took him out.<br> Well, he's ready.<br> Look at him.<br> You didn't tell dad you<br> were picking me up?<br> Don't worry about that. I wanna<br> make sure when you come out<br> that you're okay, and she<br> didn't say anything.<br> You didn't tell me? The court said yes.<br> Don't worry.<br> Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because<br> the, the court listens to the doctor.<br> Yeah, and the court said-the court<br> listens to the doctor, the doctor-<br> dad, relax. The court said<br> it's fine, okay? Let it go.<br> Don't worry.<br> Dad, I'm in there<br> because of the court.<br> That's the agreement<br> that we made months ago.<br> It was a plea bargain<br> with the courts.<br> The lawyer, he instructed me, he said<br> that what we should plead that, and<br> then I would serve eight<br> months and then I'd get out.<br> It's all under control.<br> Well... okay, okay.<br> Congratulations.<br> Thank you. So what are<br> you doing with yourself?<br> You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.<br> It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.<br> How you gonna pay for it?<br> I'm gonna pay for it,<br> don't worry about it.<br> From your bookmaking?<br> Who told you that? Mom told me.<br> Outside.<br> I did not. No, I didn't.<br> You just told me outside, mom,<br> what are you talking about?<br> Five minutes ago, we were walking up the<br> stairs, you said, "don't say anything,<br> but dad lost his job and<br> he's bookmaking.".<br> Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him?<br> He has the wrong idea.<br> Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm more<br> concerned about you than anything else.<br> Good, dad. Good.<br> Okay, the question, the big question,<br> is what are you gonna do with yourself?<br> What am I gonna do? I'm getting<br> in shape, I'm getting trim,<br> I'm getting really fit for Nikki.<br> I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching<br> syllabus and get<br> my old job back.<br> Nikki sold the house. She left.<br> Didn't your mother tell you that?<br> Let me tell you something. You don't know<br> anything about my marriage, okay, dad?<br> All right? Our marriage...<br> We're very, very much in love,<br> okay? Just like you two.<br> Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's<br> not around anymore. Nikki left.<br> What are you doing, dad? You know what?<br> Excelsior.<br> Excelsior. What does that mean?<br> It means you know what I'm gonna<br> do, I'm gonna take all this<br> negativity and use it as fuel and<br> I'm gonna find a silver lining,<br> that's what I'm gonna do.<br> And that's no bullshit.<br> That's no bullshit. That takes<br> work and that's the truth.<br> What the fuck?!<br> Stupid fucking book!<br> I just can't believe Nikki's<br> teaching that book to the kids.<br> I mean the whole time. Let me<br> just break it down for you<br> the whole time you're rooting for<br> this Hemingway guy to survive the war<br> and to be with the woman that<br> he loves, Catherine barkley...<br> It's four o'clock in<br> the morning, pat.<br> And he does. He does. He<br> survives the war, after getting<br> blown up he survives it, and<br> he escapes to Switzerland with<br> Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant.<br> Isn't that wonderful?<br> She's pregnant. And they escape<br> up into the mountains and they're<br> gonna be happy, and they're gonna<br> be drinking wine and they dance...<br> They both like to dance with each<br> other, there's scenes of them<br> dancing, which was boring, but I<br> liked it, because they were happy.<br> You think he ends it there? No!<br> He writes another ending.<br> She dies, dad! I mean,<br> the world's hard<br> enough as it is, guys. It's<br> fucking hard enough as it is.<br> Can't somebody say, "hey,<br> let's be positive?<br> Let's have a good<br> ending to the story?.<br> Pat, you owe<br> us an apology.<br> Mom, for what, I<br> can't apologize.<br> I'm not gonna<br> apologize for this.<br> You know what I will do? I<br> will apologize on behalf of<br> Ernest Hemingway, because<br> that's who's to blame here.<br> Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call<br> us and apologize to us, too.<br> Why didn't you run with me?<br> Huh!!<br> I was reading.<br> Please. Do us a favor,<br> don't read for a while.<br> What are you wearing a garbage bag for?<br> I'm gonna go run now.<br> Wait, wait, wait. You<br> have to fix this window.<br> I'll fix it when I get back.<br> Fix it now.<br> Get in the car, pat. You<br> have to go to therapy.<br> I don't wanna<br> go to therapy.<br> You have to go. It's part of the deal.<br> You can't live with us and not go.<br> Is that song<br> really playing?<br> We have music sometimes.<br> That song is killing me. Could<br> you please turn it off?<br> I can't.<br> What do you mean,<br> you can't?<br> I don't have the controls.<br> I'm sorry, I-<br> did doctor timbers<br> put you up to this?<br> Is there a speaker here?<br> Is, is the speaker here?<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> Okay... I'm sorry.<br> I'll fix all this, okay?<br> That was a messed up thing you<br> did, doctor patel. Alright!<br> That's a messed up thing.<br> I'm sorry, but that's...<br> You can call me<br> cliff, please.<br> Yeah, well, cliff, that's not the way<br> you're supposed to meet people, okay?<br> You should write that down<br> in your, I don't know<br> your little book you<br> write stuff down in.<br> I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted<br> to see if it was still a trigger for you.<br> Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm<br> not gonna take any meds,<br> I should just tell<br> you that right now.<br> No, you have to<br> take medicine.<br> No, I'm not gonna take any medicine.<br> It makes me foggy-<br> no, you will have<br> to take medication.<br> I don't want any<br> meds, doctor.<br> Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay?<br> My father is the explosion guy.<br> I'm not that guy.<br> He got kicked out of that<br> stadium he beat up so many<br> people at eagles games,<br> he's on the exclusion list.<br> I had one incident. One<br> incident can change a lifetime.<br> But I'm ready. I'm ready to take<br> responsibility for my side of the street.<br> She just needs to take<br> responsibility for hers.<br> What's hers?<br> What's hers? Are you joking?<br> Let's go back to the incident.<br> I come home from<br> work after I..<br> Fight with Nancy, the<br> high school ...Principal.<br> I come home and what's playing<br> but the song from my wedding.<br> The song that you so charmingly<br> played out here today for us.<br> That's playing and I don't think<br> anything of it. Which is odd,<br> 'cause I should have.<br> I come home, what do I see? I walk<br> in the door and I see underwear and<br> pieces of clothing and a guy's<br> pants with his belt in it,<br> and I walk up the<br> stairs, and all...<br> Ll of a sudden I see the DVD<br> player, and on the d-...<br> VD player is the cd and it's<br> playing our wedding song,<br> and then I look down<br> and I see my wife's...<br> Panties on the<br> ground and then-<br> I look up and I see her<br> naked in the shower...<br> And I think, "oh, that's kinda<br> sweet, she's in the shower.<br> What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find<br> her and maybe I'll go in there.<br> We never-...Fuck<br> in the shower anymore.<br> Maybe today we will.<br> "I...<br> Pull the curtain back and<br> there's the fucking history...<br> Teacher with tenure.<br> And you know what he says to me?<br> "you should probably go.".<br> That's what he says to me.<br> So yeah, I snapped. I<br> almost beat him to death.<br> But now I get fucking<br> chastised for it? I'm<br> parallel to my father?<br> I don't think so.<br> All right. Can you talk about something<br> that you did, before or after?<br> I left work early... which I never<br> do, by the way, but I got in a.<br> Yeah, about a week before the<br> incident, I called the cops and<br> I told them that my wife and the<br> history guy were plotting against<br> me by embezzling money from<br> the local high school, which<br> wasn't true... it was a delusion. And<br> we later found out from the hospital<br> that's because I'm, uh...<br> Undiagnosed bipolar.<br> Yeah. With mood swings and weird<br> thinking brought on by severe<br> stress, which rarely<br> happens, thank God.<br> And then the shower incident<br> happened and that's when everything<br> snapped, so I then realized that,<br> oh, wow, I've been dealing with<br> this my whole life. And without any<br> supervision I've been doing it all<br> on my own with no help and basically I've<br> been white-knuckling it this whole time.<br> That had to be hard.<br> Yeah. It's a lot to deal<br> with, especially when<br> you don't know what the<br> hell is happening,<br> which I do now. Sort of.<br> Pat, you have to take<br> your medication.<br> I can't, mom. I can't.<br> I will call them.<br> They'll come for you.<br> Why would you do that?<br> You wouldn't do that.<br> Why would you call them?<br> What's up?<br> I don't, I don't feel good<br> when I'm on them, mom.<br> I don't feel good.<br> I'm so much clearer without them.<br> Mom, they make me bloated.<br> I don't like the way<br> it makes me look.<br> Why don't you just<br> take your medication?<br> You've gotta take<br> your medication.<br> Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality.<br> I've been workin' out,<br> that's what I'm doin'.<br> Why is he wearing<br> a garbage bag?<br> Why are you wearing<br> a garbage bag?<br> To sweat.<br> Sit down.

And Veronica<br> wants to make dinner for you.<br> Congratulations on the baby, but<br> I'm not buying the invitation.<br> 'Cause you think Veronica<br> still hates you?<br> I know Veronica still hates me.<br> That's not true.<br> Yes, it is. Nikki<br> always said that.<br> "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar<br> where she keeps his balls, in her purse.".<br> That's not true.<br> Ronnie! What<br> are you doing?<br> Okay, it's a little true. But if<br> you think she still hates you,<br> you're wrong because why would she<br> tell me to invite you to dinner?<br> Hmm?<br> Did you invite him?<br> Yes.<br> Well, can he make it?<br> I don't know yet!

What's<br> the good news?<br> Things are looking up.<br> Oh, are they?<br> You know what, I knew why they<br> invited me over. I knew it.<br> Listen, she might<br> be with that guy.<br> That, the...<br> Oh, no way!<br> She..., no, she might be with him.<br> She's afraid of you.<br> She doesn't want<br> to talk to you.<br> No way, dad.

Pat.<br> Solatano?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah? Missus solatano, mister<br> solatano, I'm officer keogh.<br> I work this beat. Look, I heard<br> about the restraining order.<br> And I heard you went to your<br> old house and the school.<br> It's not okay. I've been<br> assigned to your case, so you're<br> gonna be seeing a lot of me.<br> Do yourself a favor.<br> Respect the restraining<br> order, okay?<br> Five hundred feet.

Sorry.<br> We understand.<br> Since when do<br> cops have cards?<br> Tell me one thing. Would you like<br> to be a guy who goes back to jail<br> or to the hospital? Hmm? So take<br> your medication and if you do fine,<br> we'll reduce them.<br> Nikki's waiting for me to get in<br> shape and get my life in order, and<br> then she's gonna be with me. And<br> that's better than any medication.<br> Pat, there's a possibility, and I<br> want you to be prepared for it,<br> that she may not return. True love<br> is about letting her go and seeing<br> if she returns. In the meantime, if<br> you listen to that song, I don't<br> want you to fall apart. So get a<br> strategy, okay? You need one.<br> Let me say something, I<br> gotta say something.<br> Okay.<br> This is what I<br> believe to be true.<br> This is what I learned<br> in the hospital.<br> You have to do everything you<br> can, you have to work your<br> hardest, and if you do,<br> if you stay positive,<br> you have a shot at<br> a silver lining.<br> Work on a strategy, okay?<br> Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this<br> party on Sunday night and it's like<br> a real hoity-toity thing and his wife,<br> Veronica's a real stickler for...<br> I don't know, my mom got<br> this gap outfit she<br> wants me to wear, but<br> I wanna wear a Jersey<br> that my brother, Jake,<br> got me from the eagles.<br> Which Jersey?<br> Desean Jackson.<br> Desean Jackson is the man.<br> Well, that settles that.<br> Pat!

I like that Jersey.<br> I wish I was wearing that Jersey.<br> I feel like an idiot.<br> Are you comfortable?<br> Veronica's not<br> gonna like it.<br> Get over here.<br> Plus you got a tie on.<br> Don't worry about it,<br> you're the guest of honor.<br> You come however you wanna come.<br> Really?<br> Get over here.<br> Desean Jackson's<br> in the house!<br> You mean rookie<br> of the year?<br> Yeah.<br> Desean Jackson?<br> Desean Jackson?<br> Oh, you wore a<br> Jersey to dinner.<br> Isn't it awesome?<br> Not for dinner.<br> Look, he got us flowers.<br> Oh, that's sweet.

Gotta be making a<br> lot of paper to do that.<br> Yeah, we're doing all right, man.<br> I can't complain.<br> Isn't the market<br> down, though?<br> It is down, but you know, she wants<br> more, so I'm giving her more, man.<br> Hey, you know my dad<br> lost his pension.<br> I'm sorry, man.<br> Yeah.<br> A lot of people.<br> My Uncle, too.<br> Really?<br> Yeah, but you know what? No<br> disrespect, it's not personal,<br> but this is the<br> time to strike.<br> You start snapping up<br> commercial real estate...<br> Cheap... flip it<br> over, you flip it over and<br> that's when you make the money.<br> But the pressure...<br> It's like...<br> You okay?<br> I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody.<br> Listen to me.<br> I feel like I'm<br> getting crushed and-<br> crushed by what?<br> Everything. The family, the baby,<br> the job, the fucking dicks at work,<br> and it's like, you know, like I'm<br> trying to do this, you know, and,<br> and, and I'm like...<br> Suffocating.<br> Holy shit.<br> You can't be happy<br> all the time.<br> Who told you you<br> can't be happy?<br> It's all right. You just do<br> your best, you have no choice.<br> That's not true at all.<br> You just can't.<br> Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!<br> I hope you're okay with<br> Veronica's sister coming over.<br> You okay with that? Who?<br> Veronica's sister.<br> Tiffany. Tiffany and...<br> Tommy?<br> Yeah. Just Tiffany.<br> What happened to Tommy?<br> He died.<br> Tommy died?

I<br> wanna acknowledge her beauty.<br> I never used to do that.<br> I do that now.<br> 'Cause we're gonna be better than ever...<br> Nikki. Just practicing.<br> How'd Tommy die?<br> What about your job?<br> I just got<br> fired, actually.<br> Oh, really? How?<br> I mean, I'm sorry.<br> How'd that happen?<br> Does it really matter?<br> Baby, how's it going?<br> Great, great.<br> We're gonna go<br> on a tour now.<br> Let's go see the house.<br> Come on, let's<br> go for the tour.<br> I've, I've been planning this forever.<br> I love our house.<br> I love our house.

It's a...<br> Ooh, ooh, warmer,<br> warmer, warmer.<br> It's a drawer at a morgue<br> where they pull out dead<br> bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.<br> Where would the body go, though?<br> It's a joke!<br> It's a... fireplace.<br> In the middle of the wall?<br> We have a port in every room.<br> Gimme an iPod.<br> Who, who doesn't<br> have an iPod?<br> Well, I don't have an iPod.<br> I don't even have a phone.<br> They won't let me make any calls.<br> They think I'm gonna call Nikki.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Don't focus on that.<br> I would call Nikki.<br> I'm actually gonna give<br> you one of my iPods.<br> I have an old one.<br> Gimme your iPod.<br> Give it to me. Thank<br> you, baby, thank you.<br> Of all the rooms there<br> are iPod ports in,<br> I'm happy you brought<br> us into the bathroom.<br> I can play music for<br> the baby in any room.<br> Can you play "ride the<br> lightning"by metallica?<br> Pat was a history sub at<br> the high school, Tiffany.<br> Ask him about any president,<br> he knows 'em all.<br> Here's a fun fact. You know<br> where the term "ok"comes from?<br> No. No, I don't.<br> Where?<br> Well, Martin van buren, the eighth<br> President of the United States of<br> America, is from<br> kinderhook, New York...<br> Oh.<br> And he was part of a club, a men's<br> club, called old kinderhook.<br> And if you were cool, you<br> were in the club, they'd say,<br> "that guy's ok. "'Cause he<br> was in the old kinderhooks.<br> Really?<br> Yeah. Pretty cool, right?<br> That's interesting.<br> You know, Tiffany's been doing this<br> dance thing for years and she's<br> real good at it. She's gonna be<br> competing at the Ben Franklin hotel.<br> Oh, really? My wife loves dance.<br> Nikki loves dance.<br> Why do you have to talk<br> about me like that?<br> I'm just bragging about you. Can't<br> I brag about my little sister?<br> Don't talk about me<br> in the third person.<br> Please, gimme a break.<br> I'm right here.<br> Just be nice.<br> Just be nice.<br> Wow, wow, wow.<br> Fascinating.<br> Sorry. I don't<br> wanna be mean.<br> I know. I know, I know.<br> What meds are you on?<br> Me? None. I used to be on lithium<br> and Seroquel and Abilify,<br> but I don't take them anymore, no.<br> They make me foggy<br> and they also<br> make me bloated.<br> Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,<br> but I agree, I wasn't as sharp,<br> so I stopped. You<br> ever take klonopin?<br> Klonopin? Yeah.<br> Right? Jesus.<br> It's like, "what? What day<br> is it?"how about trazodone?<br> Trazodone!<br> Oh, it flattens you out.<br> I mean, you are done.<br> It takes the light right<br> out of your eyes.<br> God, I bet it does.<br> I'm tired. I wanna go.<br> No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we<br> haven't even finished the salad<br> yet, or the duck. I made<br> the fire and ice cake.<br> I said I'm tired. Are you<br> gonna walk me home or what?<br> You mean me?<br> Yeah, you. Are you<br> gonna walk me home?<br> You have poor social skills.<br> You have a problem.<br> I have a problem? You say more<br> inappropriate things than<br> appropriate things.<br> You scare people.<br> I tell the truth.<br> But you're mean.<br> What? I'm not<br> telling the truth?<br> Um, maybe I should drive<br> them home separately?<br> You can drive them both home.<br> Now.<br> Stop talking about me in third person.<br> You can take Tiffany home first.<br> You love it when<br> I have problems.<br> You love it, Von, because then you<br> can be the good one. Just say it.<br> No... I don't. I don't. I<br> just wanted to have a nice,<br> I just wanted to have a nice dinner.<br> Oh, God.<br> What is your problem?!<br> Nothing's my problem!

I don't wanna<br> wake up the baby. Bye.<br> Listen, I haven't dated since<br> before my marriage so I don't<br> really remember<br> how this works.<br> How what works?<br> I saw the way you were<br> looking at me, pat.<br> You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.<br> We're not liars like they are.<br> I live in the addition around<br> back, which is completely<br> separate from my parents' house, so<br> there's no chance of them walking<br> in on us. I hate the fact that you<br> wore a football Jersey to dinner<br> because I hate football, but you can fuck<br> me if you turn the lights off, okay?<br> How old are you?<br> Old enough to have a marriage end and<br> not wind up in a mental hospital.<br> Look, I had a really good time<br> tonight and I think you're really<br> pretty, but I'm<br> married, okay?<br> You're married? So am I.<br> No, that's confusing.<br> He's dead.<br> Wait, what?<br> What's happening?<br> Oh, my God. Hey.<br> Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey,<br> is that make-up on your shirt?<br> I don't know, mom.<br> What happened over there?<br> When am I gonna<br> get a phone?<br> You'll get a phone<br> in due time.<br> What happened?<br> Pat!<br> Mom!<br> I can't find my wedding video.<br> Mom, wake up.<br> What is it?<br> Where's my wedding video?<br> It's after three o'clock!<br> What are you doing?<br> I looked in here, but this is all<br> your sewing shit up here, for your<br> sewing and everything.<br> Did you put it up here?<br> What about in your<br> father's study?<br> Don't go in my study.<br> Dad, not now!<br> Would you put it in here? It makes<br> no sense for you to put it in here.<br> Patty, what are you doing?<br> He's got all his eagles videos<br> and not one video of my wedding!<br> Is it here? I mean...?<br> Patty!<br> It's probably<br> in the attic.<br> Are you going in my study?<br> It feels to me like you wanna<br> hide my wedding video.<br> Please stop yelling!<br> I'm not yelling, mom,<br> I'm just frustrated<br> because I should have my<br> fucking wedding video!<br> Pat! Pat!<br> I looked over there! I already<br> looked all over there!<br> Calm down, pat.<br> I'm not calming down! I don't<br> give a fuck who hears,<br> I'm not calming down!<br> Anybody can wake up!<br> I'm not ashamed of it!<br> I'm not ashamed of it!<br> Let the whole neighborhood wake up!<br> I... don't care!<br> Pat! Stop it!<br> Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!<br> What's going on?<br> What?<br> I want it! It-...<br> Hey!<br> It's my wedding! It's<br> my wedding video!<br> Pat! Stop it! Stop it!<br> Stop it!<br> I can't watch my wedding video,<br> but I can hear the fucking song.<br> Mom?<br> What the fuck you doing?! You...<br> Hit your mother?!<br> No, no, no, no, no!<br> Stop it!<br> Get off me, dad!<br> Stop hitting him!<br> Stop hitting him!<br> I'm not hitting him!<br> He's hitting me!<br> I'm sorry! I'm sorry!<br> I'm sorry!<br> Police! Open up.<br> Mister solatano, I<br> got a lot of calls.<br> People in the neighborhood are scared.<br> I gotta come in.<br> How are we doing<br> in here, huh?<br> There are a lot of reports from your<br> neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.<br> Nikki is being manipulated and controlled.<br> You have to talk to her.<br> Hey, sit down.<br> Sit down.<br> You gotta stop with<br> these crazy theories.<br> He's a cop. What<br> are you doing?<br> It's a medication problem,<br> but he's fine now.<br> Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna<br> send him back to Baltimore?<br> We know all about the explosion<br> at the psychiatrist's office.<br> What?<br> What explosion? No. Cliff<br> is lying, that's not true.<br> He's not allowed to<br> talk about that.<br> Jesus Christ, who's that?<br> Keep an eye on him.<br> Is this a bipolar episode?<br> Get outta here, you<br> little fuckin'<br> idiot! Get outta here!<br> Someone, help me! Help me!<br> You can't tell<br> Nikki about this,<br> officer.<br> Look, I gotta make<br> out a report.<br> No, no, no, listen, sir.<br> Hey! Sit down.<br> He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me!<br> Help me!<br> Sit down!<br> I'm sorry. I could just write<br> you a letter and you could just<br> let me have five minutes, explaining<br> how much better I'm doing.<br> There's a court order against you...<br> Five hundred feet. Listen to me!<br> And I'll take that fucking camera<br> and I'm gonna break it over<br> your fuckin' head, then I'm gonna<br> come back and interview you about<br> what it's like to get that fuckin'<br> camera broken over your head!<br> Youwa..., what are<br> you laughing about?<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Okay.<br> Go back to sleep. The party's over.<br> Show's over.<br> This is not a reflection of where I'm at.<br> You can't... please,<br> you can't tell her any of this<br> you can't tell Nikki about this.<br> You need to pipe down.<br> Everything all right?<br> Who was at the door?<br> Who was that, dad?<br> It was that kid<br> with the camera.<br> Good luck. I gotta<br> write this up.<br> Come on, don't write it up! I<br> don't want her to see this!<br> It's okay, everything is okay.<br> We're fine, thank you,<br> we appreciate it.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey!<br> What the hell?<br> What happened<br> to your face?<br> Weight lifting accident.<br> That sounds like bullshit.<br> Why'd you run by my house?<br> Did our little conversation<br> get you upset last night?<br> Hey, this is my route, okay?<br> Just back off.<br> This is my neighborhood.<br> You just ran by my house.<br> I like to run by<br> myself, okay?<br> Me too.<br> Hey, I like to run alone!<br> Will you stop?<br> What?<br> Okay? I'm running here!<br> Me too!<br> Well then, why don't you<br> run somewhere else?<br> There's a fucking ton of roads to run in!<br> What are you trying to do?<br> I like this road. This<br> is my neighborhood.<br> Oh, come on, please!<br> Calm down, crazy.<br> Hey!<br> What the fuck?!<br> I'm married!<br> So am I!<br> What the fuck are you doing?<br> Your husband's dead!<br> Where is your wife?<br> You're crazy!<br> I'm not the one that just got out<br> of that hospital in Baltimore.<br> I'm not the big slut!<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.<br> There's always gonna be a<br> part of me that's sloppy and dirty,<br> but I like that, with all the other<br> parts of myself. Can you say the<br> same about yourself, fucker?!<br> Can you forgive? Are<br> you any good at that?<br> You seemed to have<br> trouble last night.<br> Let me just set the record<br> straight about last night.<br> Hurting my mother was a mistake<br> and I hate myself for it,<br> and I hate my illness and<br> I want to control it.<br> My father, on the other<br> hand, had no trouble<br> slapping the shit out of me last<br> night, which I did not return<br> 'cause I could've killed him and I didn't.<br> He's sixty-five years old.<br> You don't think I could've beat<br> the shit out of him? I mean...<br> He was scared for your mother<br> and you hurt him as well.<br> Yes, last night was a mess.<br> Okay? And I think<br> he probably just tried<br> to do his best.<br> Pat, you have to have a strategy.<br> I told you earlier.<br> You need to recognize these feelings<br> coming to you, otherwise you will be sent<br> back to Baltimore. So when you get<br> these feelings, you need to get to<br> a quieter place, and be at peace<br> with yourself, however you can.<br> Yeah, but that's<br> easier said than done.<br> You have to do it. You have no choice.<br> Excelsior.<br> Yeah, excelsior. Listen, I have a<br> letter I want you to give Nikki,<br> okay?<br> No.<br> Why?<br> Because you have<br> a restraining<br> order.<br> What good are you, man?<br> Why did you have this<br> overwhelming urgency to see your<br> wedding video last night?<br> Oh, I don't know, because I'm<br> married and I haven't seen my wife<br> in eight and a<br> half months?<br> Maybe you think that Nikki's not<br> around and Tiffany's an attractive<br> girl and if you get drawn towards<br> Tiffany, you will spoil your<br> chances of getting<br> Nikki back to you?<br> Not bad, doctor Jones. But I<br> don't think I'm gonna blow it<br> with Nikki because<br> Tiffany's a slut.<br> Why is she a slut?<br> After the dinner<br> at Ronnie's,<br> she said, quote, "we can<br> go to the back house and"<br> you can fuck me as long as<br> we turn the lights out."<br> Unquote. And she still<br> wears her wedding ring.<br> So she's a loyal,<br> married-to-a-dead-guy slut.<br> Maybe she just needs a friend and<br> she thought if she offers you sex,<br> it will be easier for you<br> to become friends with her.<br> She said she's not a whore anymore,<br> but she likes that part of herself<br> along with all the other parts of<br> herself and can I say the same?<br> Can you?<br> Is that...? You're asking me, you're<br> really asking me that question?<br> Yes.<br> With all my crazy sad shit?<br> What, are you fucking nuts?<br> Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.<br> I'm just giving back your<br> words to you. This "crazy sad<br> shit," as you call it, made you a<br> happier, calmer person with a<br> beautiful positive philosophy of<br> going outdoors, working<br> out, and reading books.<br> No, not the books. You<br> said Nikki's friends with<br> Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if<br> you become friends with Tiffany,<br> Nikki will think that you're a<br> kind, generous, large-hearted<br> person, who helps people in need,<br> who is basically thriving. So if<br> you help Tiffany, it<br> will be good for you.<br> Hey!<br> How do you know<br> when I run?<br> I wanted to clarify<br> something.<br> I just want us<br> to be friends.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> Why are you giving<br> me such a hard time?<br> No, I'm not giving<br> you a hard time.<br> I don't know how to act with<br> you when you do this shit.<br> You wanna have dinner<br> at this diner?<br> Pick me up at<br> seven thirty.<br> Happy Halloween.<br> Hi.<br> Here you go.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm gonna have a bowl<br> of your raisin bran.<br> Great!<br> Tea be right back.<br> You look nice.<br> Thanks.<br> Raisin bran. Milk.<br> Thank you.<br> You want to share this?<br> Why did you order<br> raisin bran?<br> Why did you order tea?<br> Because you ordered<br> raisin bran.<br> I ordered raisin bran because<br> I didn't want there to be any<br> mistaking this for a date.<br> It can still be a date if<br> you order raisin bran.<br> It's not a date. So how's<br> your thing going...<br> Your dancing thing?<br> It's good. How's your<br> restraining order?<br> I wouldn't actually call the<br> restraining order "my thing,""<br> but getting back with Nikki is,<br> and I've been doing pretty well.<br> Except for a minor incident<br> at the doctor's office.<br> And the so-called incident<br> with the weights.<br> Yeah. That was a thing with my parents.<br> I wish I could just<br> explain it all in a letter to Nikki<br> because it was minor and I could<br> just explain it and let her know<br> that I'm actually not out of<br> control and that I'm<br> actually doing really well.<br> I can get a letter to Nikki. I see<br> her sometimes with my sister.<br> It would be so amazing if you could<br> get a letter to Nikki from me.<br> I'd have to hide it from Veronica.<br> She's not into breaking the law,<br> which this letter would<br> definitely be doing.<br> But you would do it?<br> I'd have to be careful. I'm already<br> on thin ice with my family,<br> you should hear how<br> I lost my job.<br> How did you lose your job?<br> By... having sex with<br> everybody in the office.<br> Everybody?<br> I was very depressed after Tommy died.<br> It was a lot of people.<br> We don't have to<br> talk about it.<br> Thanks.<br> How many were there?<br> Eleven.<br> Wow.<br> I know.<br> I'm not gonna talk<br> about it anymore.<br> Okay.<br> Can I ask you one<br> more question?<br> Were there any women?<br> Yes.<br> Really?<br> Yes.<br> What was that like?<br> Hot.<br> Jesus Christ. Was it like...<br> Older women,<br> a sexy teacher who<br> wants to seduce you-<br> made me sit on her lap<br> and do things? Yeah.<br> What? You sat on her lap?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> She told you what to do?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Oh... my God. Nikki hated<br> when I talked like this.<br> Made me feel like such a pervert.<br> Maybe we should change the subject.<br> I don't mind it.<br> You don't, do you.<br> No. But then people were getting<br> into fights in the parking lot at<br> work, and in the bathroom... and the<br> boss called me in to his office and<br> tried to pin it all on me. So I<br> accused him of harassment and then<br> they fired me, sent me home<br> and put me on some meds.<br> I get it. The song that was<br> playing when my wife...<br> Was in the shower with<br> the history teacher...<br> I heard about that.<br> It was my wedding song and when<br> I hear it, I go kinda crazy.<br> Sometimes I hear it when<br> it's not even playing.<br> Wow.<br> Yeah. So they put me on medication,<br> which I feel ashamed of.<br> Yeah.<br> So I know.<br> You do.<br> I just gotta get a<br> strategy, you know?<br> Me too.<br> We'd better get<br> back to the letter.<br> Yeah, let's get<br> back to the letter.<br> What if you told Nikki when<br> Veronica was in the bathroom?<br> Yes. Yes, that could work.<br> I love that.<br> Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home<br> and write the letter right now.<br> Can I at least<br> finish my tea?<br> Wait, what?<br> My tea. Can I finish it?<br> Wait a minute. Did Veronica<br> tell Nikki about our dinner?<br> Why would she do that?<br> Was it a test?<br> I kinda got that<br> feeling, yeah.<br> Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test.<br> How did I do?<br> I think I did pretty well.<br> Yeah, she said you<br> were cool, basically.<br> "Basically? Was I some<br> percentage not cool?<br> No, she said you were<br> cool, but you know.<br> No, I don't know.<br> Sort of how you are.<br> It's fine, relax.<br> What do you mean? How am I?<br> What does that mean?<br> Sort of like me.<br> "Sort of like you"? I hope to<br> God she didn't tell Nikki that.<br> Why?<br> Because, it's just not right,<br> lumping you and I together,<br> I mean, it's just wrong. And<br> Nikki wouldn't like that.<br> Especially after all the<br> shit you just told me.<br> You think that I'm<br> crazier than you.<br> Because, well, we're<br> different, I mean-<br> oh, my God. Ugh.<br> You're killing me.<br> You know what? Forget I<br> offered to help you.<br> Forget the entire fucking idea.<br> 'Cause that must have been<br> fucking crazy because I am<br> so much crazier than you.<br> Keep your voice down.<br> I'm just the crazy slut<br> with a dead husband!<br> Forget it!<br> Shut the fuck up.<br> Fuck you!<br> You shut the fuck up!<br> Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!<br> Slow down, raisin bran.<br> Hey, come on. Look, I don't<br> think you're crazy, all right?<br> Yes, you do.<br> No, I don't.<br> You told your therapist that you<br> were in a superior mental illness<br> category, didn't you?<br> What? Hey, calm down! Hey-<br> just leave me alone!<br> Can I just explain<br> myself, please?<br> I didn't want Nikki to think that I<br> was associated with that kind of<br> sexual behavior because I've never<br> done anything like that, okay?<br> You may not have experienced<br> the shit that I did.<br> But you loved hearing<br> about it, didn't you?<br> You are afraid to be alive,<br> you're afraid to live.<br> You're a hypocrite.<br> You're a conformist. You're a liar. I<br> opened up to you and you judged me.<br> You are an asshole.<br> You are an asshole!<br> Get off of me! Get off!<br> You're harassing me!<br> Hey, hey!<br> He's harassing me!<br> Get off!<br> Take it easy. Dude, relax.<br> He's harassing me!!<br> Bro, get off of me.<br> He's harassing me!!<br> Hey, hey, stop, stop.<br> Stop, all right?<br> Hey, get off of me!<br> Shut up, shut up.<br> Stop it.<br> Hey, hey, hey, get off me!<br> What are you doing? Come on.<br> What are you doing?<br> What are you doing<br> to these kids?<br> Are you being a punk on<br> Halloween with these kids?<br> You wanna go back to Baltimore?<br> Is that what you wanna do?<br> I didn't, I<br> didn't, I didn't-<br> it's the kids!<br> Honestly he didn't do anything,<br> it was all the kids.<br> Let's go, clear out,<br> nothing going on here.<br> Come on man what you gonna<br> do about that song? You<br> gonna go your whole life<br> scared of that song?<br> It's just a song. Don't<br> make it a monster.<br> Come on breath! There's no song playing.<br> There's no song.<br> That's it.<br> That's it. There you go.<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I took it too far.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Hey, is he messing<br> with you?<br> No, no. No, this was just a joke.<br> This is a joke I started.<br> There's a restraining<br> order on this guy.<br> I know, I have a<br> stupid sense of humor.<br> That's not a good<br> thing to do.<br> Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you?<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're Tommy's<br> widow, right?<br> Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus<br> the whore thing for the most part.<br> You're a funny girl. You<br> wanna get a drink sometime?<br> What'd I say? She doesn't,<br> she doesn't do that anymore.<br> I'm sorry about what<br> I said in the diner.<br> I know. I know you<br> didn't mean it.<br> I didn't mean it at all.<br> I know, you say shit you<br> don't mean all the time.<br> All the time. I'll still give your<br> letter to Nikki, don't worry.<br> Wow. I really appreciate<br> that, Tiffany.<br> I know you do.<br> You do? Yeah, sure. I'll see you tomorrow?<br> With the letter?<br> I'll bet I know what happened<br> if only one is missing.<br> Either Dolores or pat needed an<br> envelope and one of 'em took it.<br> That's the only answer.<br> No, no, no.<br> Dolores, somebody was in my study.<br> Who took one of my envelopes?<br> Somebody took an envelope.<br> Maybe we should<br> call the FBI.<br> Don't make fun.<br> This is serious.<br> What FBI? Come on, let's take a look.<br> I'll show you what this is.<br> I'm gonna just explain to you something.<br> I mean, you know what<br> I'm doing, honey. This<br> everything, like this.<br> I got this, it<br> all corresponds.<br> Dad, I borrowed one<br> of your envelopes.<br> I hope that's<br> not a problem.<br> No, it's not okay. It's not okay.<br> You gotta ask.<br> "Do not go in my study<br> or I will eat you!.<br> It's not funny,<br> it's not funny.<br> What's everybody making<br> a joke out of this for?<br> Dolores, you are<br> so beautiful!<br> Stop that! Hey, hey,<br> hey, stop, stop, stop!<br> Listen, a lot of envelopes go in<br> and out of my office every day<br> after games with<br> a lot of cash in<br> 'em. So show some<br> respect for what I do.<br> Yeah, I know. I saw<br> two-seven-four.<br> I just wanted to<br> tell you the number.<br> Thank you.<br> But the envelope was empty.<br> I'm sorry, you were sleeping.<br> I didn't want to wake you,<br> but I needed an envelope.<br> You didn't want to wake me?<br> He didn't want to wake me.<br> He doesn't have a problem complaining<br> about Ernest fucking Hemingway.<br> He doesn't have a problem<br> asking for his wedding video-<br> be nice.

Taking a little bit<br> too many or something?<br> No, if I was taking that,<br> I'd be on the floor, dad.<br> Just stay with us. Stay for the game.<br> Spend some family time.<br> Dad, I can't.

Have you guys not seen us?<br> I took her to the diner.<br> She's not here.<br> Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey.<br> Is Tiffany home? Go away.<br> I know her. I know her, we've dated.<br> We still date.<br> What are you doing here? I've<br> called her, I've texted her.<br> I still haven't heard back.<br> We used to work together-<br> just get the hell<br> out of here...<br> I just wanted to give you<br> my card to give to her.<br> Another rude creep. Listen<br> to what he's saying.<br> Listen to what he's saying.<br> What's he saying?<br> He's saying you're<br> being rude.<br> How am I being rude?<br> Oh, you know. You know.<br> Come on.<br> Sometimes it's okay with girls like this,<br> they wanna have fun and sometimes -<br> - it's not because they got a<br> broken wing, and they're hurt,<br> and they're an easy target. And in<br> this case, in this particular case,<br> I think that wing<br> is being fixed.<br> And you gotta make sure it gets mended.<br> And you're gettin' in the<br> way of that right now, okay?<br> Because she's sensitive and she's<br> smart, she's artistic. This is<br> a great girl and you gotta be<br> respectful of that.<br> Come on.<br> Let me walk you down to your car.<br> You're a better guy than this.<br> I can see it in your eyes.<br> She just texted me!<br> Hey! Hey, wait a second!<br> What are you doing?<br> What happened?<br> How come you weren't outside?<br> What the hell's going on?<br> I can't, I can't do it.<br> What do you mean, you can't do it?<br> You can't do what?<br> I can't give the<br> letter to Nikki.<br> Tiffany, what are you talking about?<br> What do you mean you can't<br> give the letter to Nikki? Because<br> what am I getting in return?<br> What are you doing for me? You said!<br> You said if I wrote a letter,<br> you'd get it to Nikki. I know.<br> That was the set-up.<br> Because I do this time after time<br> after time, I do all this shit for<br> other people and then I wake up<br> and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!<br> What are you talking about? You<br> seem like you're a tough girl to<br> me. Why don't you just<br> do things on your own?<br> I always get myself in these<br> fucking situations. I give<br> everything to other people and<br> nobody ever, I never... I don't get<br> what I want, okay?<br> I'm not my sister.<br> Alright, well, ask for you.<br> What can I do for you?<br> I can't do it. Tiffany,<br> what do you want me to do?<br> Think of something.<br> There's this thing.<br> There's a thing, okay.<br> What kind of thing?<br> It's a thing, it's a thing.<br> It's a, it's a dance thing.<br> It's a dance<br> thing, all right.<br> It's a competition thing at<br> the Benjamin Franklin hotel.<br> Tommy would never do it with me and<br> I missed it every single year.<br> Well, Tommy's dead, so he's<br> not gonna fucking do it.<br> Would you please! I don't<br> have a filter when I talk.<br> Can we have one conversation<br> without you reminding me that my<br> goddamn husband is dead?<br> Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> Okay, I'm sorry.<br> But I can only do it if I have a partner...<br> And now I'm about to miss<br> it for another year.<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not<br> gonna fuckin' dance with you.<br> What are you<br> talking about?<br> What, your schedule is so busy?<br> "grapes of wrath"and watching<br> football with your dad?<br> Tiffany, I'm not gonna<br> do a dance with you.<br> All right, then I'm not giving<br> her your fucking letter.<br> Wait a second! But you<br> promised you would do this.<br> Think about it.<br> Well, I already did do<br> something for you, you know.<br> I took care of that jerkoff that<br> was in front of your house.<br> What? Jordie?<br> Let me ask you something. Do you<br> call him when you're lonely?<br> That encourages him, Tiffany.<br> You shouldn't do it.<br> Couldn't you say the same<br> about you and Nikki?<br> It's not at all<br> like me and Nikki.<br> What are you talking about? We're<br> in love and we're married.<br> It's completely different.<br> How are you in love? Tell me about that.<br> The big Nikki love.<br> Tell me about it, I<br> wanna understand it.<br> We have a very unconventional<br> chemistry, it makes people feel<br> awkward, but not me. She's the most<br> beautiful woman I've ever been with.<br> Wow. It's electric<br> between us,<br> okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other,<br> but that's normal, couples wanna do that,<br> I want her to stop dressing<br> like she dresses, I want her to<br> stop acting so superior to me, okay?<br> And she wanted me to lose<br> weight and stop my mood swings,<br> both of which I've done.<br> I mean, people fight. Couples fight.<br> We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a<br> couple weeks. That's normal. She<br> always wanted the best for me.<br> She wanted me to be passionate and<br> compassionate. And that's a good<br> thing. You know? I just, look, I'm<br> my best self today, and I think<br> she's her best self today, and our<br> love's gonna be fucking amazing.<br> It's gonna be amazing, and you're<br> gonna be amazing, and she's gonna<br> be amazing, and you're not gonna<br> be that guy that's gonna take<br> advantage of a situation without<br> offering to do something back.<br> So think about<br> the dance thing.<br> Danny, you're out of the hospital?<br> And you're here on game day?<br> I'm out. It's official, man.<br> They didn't convert me to my.<br> Mental hygiene law admission status<br> within two thirds of the maximum length<br> of my felony sentence, so I'm out.<br> They had to let me go.<br> I never understand<br> what he's saying.<br> Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,<br> let's come back and sit down the<br> way you were before.<br> What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br> Dad's got you sitting here?<br> Oh, yeah. He calls me<br> "jailhouse lawyer.".<br> Hold the remote the way you<br> were holding it before.<br> Okay. And now you're<br> holding the remote?<br> And it's working.<br> Your dad's a genius.<br> Now sit up. And Danny's<br> the good luck charm?<br> Danny's from you. This is your<br> house, so it comes down to you.<br> You're the one.

She's my friend.<br> Why would you say that?<br> Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful.<br> She goes to a lot of therapy.<br> I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.<br> What are you trying to say?<br> I'm just saying-am<br> I messed up?<br> Why don't you stop judging people?<br> You judge everybody. You're the one<br> who has a messed<br> up marriage.<br> I'm just looking out for you, I'm just<br> looking out for you. She's unstable.<br> What's wrong with your marriage?<br> What's wrong with your marriage?<br> Nothing's wrong!<br> You should have seen<br> when I was at his house.<br> It's like a circus over there.<br> Shh, shh. What are you talking about?<br> I'm not gonna hide this.<br> You need to deal with it.<br> Stop breaking my balls.<br> Oh!!!! I got you an iPod.<br> Whoa! Is this for me?<br> Yeah.

And -<br> Ronnie, that's fucked up. Yeah,<br> but it makes me feel better.<br> It's like my<br> therapy, you know?<br> When I'm with Nikki, I'm never<br> gonna do stuff like that...<br> Whoa, Nikki? What's<br> all this about Nikki?<br> Pan from the framed photo of Jake on<br> foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above.<br> A restraining order is<br> nothing to fool with, bro.<br> Holy shit, look at you! You<br> are fit! You look absolutely amazing.<br> You feel good?<br> How you doing, Jake? Good. You look<br> like Schwarzenegger in his prime.<br> Didn't I say you<br> wouldn't recognize him?<br> So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't<br> come see you down at the hospital.<br> You know how those places creep me<br> out, and the firm's been expanding.<br> I've been helping pop with the<br> restaurant 'cause he needs to have<br> a legitimate business.<br> He needs a tax return.<br> With all the money that<br> he's making with his bookmaking,<br> they're gonna come after him. And<br> then it looks like I'm making, I'm<br> gonna make partner at the firm.<br> Well, I don't even know what to say<br> to you anymore. You lost your wife,<br> I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be<br> able to tell you about those kind<br> of things. You lost your house, I'm<br> getting a new house. You lost your<br> job, things are going<br> great for me at the firm.<br> Maybe stop talking about all the<br> stuff that's good for you and bad<br> for him. Just, you know, leave it alone.<br> We're watching the game.<br> You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm<br> just gonna, I'm just gonna stop<br> talking. I'm gonna<br> shut my mouth.<br> As my friend Danny would say I got<br> nothing but love for you, brother.<br> That's right. That's right.<br> That's nice. That's nice.<br> Well, thank God, finally. Desean Jackson.<br> Yeah. Did it fit?<br> I wore it to<br> Ronnie's for dinner.<br> Beautiful Jersey. I<br> love that Jersey.<br> Veronica didn't like it.<br> Veronica hates the Jersey.<br> Whatever you do, watch out for<br> that restraining order, okay?<br> Don't let Tiffany<br> get you in trouble.<br> Pat, you're up to<br> something, I know.<br> People like Tiffany, or Danny, or<br> me, maybe we know something that<br> you guys don't know, okay? Did you<br> ever think about that? Maybe we<br> understand something<br> because we're more-<br> we have a sixth sense. I mean,<br> everybody's got it. Everybody's<br> just not in touch with it.<br> Oh, no. How you doing, pat?<br> Jesus.<br> I guess his sixth sense forgot to<br> tell him the cops were coming.<br> I'm taking him back<br> to the hospital.<br> What? No, no, he passed<br> his thing, right?<br> First of all, check with the<br> latest legal development.<br> Well, we got a call that they did<br> convert you to a mental hygiene law<br> admission status by the deadline<br> of your sentence, so...<br> Wait a minute. Are you an eagles<br> fan or are you not an eagles fan?<br> I'm an eagles fan.<br> Well then, what's the problem? He's<br> not goin' anywhere. Just let him<br> finish the game, that's all. The<br> handkerchief is working. We're<br> killing the seahawks,<br> twenty-seventen.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Let him stay, please!<br> I don't know what the hell you're<br> talking about "the handkerchief.<br> And I'm glad that the seahawks are<br> losing and we're winning, but I<br> gotta take Danny mcdaniels back to<br> Baltimore, alright? He can contest<br> his case from Baltimore.<br> Not correct about the mental hygiene law.<br> You're not correct.<br> Come on. You guys oughta<br> be ashamed of yourselves.<br> I used the insurance money to build this.<br> I designed it. All the floors<br> are hard oak. It has good<br> bounce for dancers. Wow.<br> I'm not that great of a<br> dancer, but who cares?<br> It's therapy and it's<br> fun. And the walls are good 'cause<br> I can play music really loud<br> without anybody hearing.<br> Where do you sleep?<br> Upstairs. It's a garage,<br> I just renovated it.<br> You know, I was<br> thinking about putting<br> a ballet barre here.<br> When are you gonna<br> give it to her?<br> What?<br> The letter to Nikki.<br> Probably tonight. Really?<br> Ronnie and Veronica and I<br> are gonna see her tonight.<br> Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph.<br> I did this thing about<br> Shakespeare and how<br> it's very romantic-<br> mm-hmm. -And that maybe<br> in the future if<br> she wanted to go dancing, I can be<br> able to do that because of all the<br> training that-no, that's<br> good, that's really good.<br> I assume you're<br> a good teacher.<br> Yeah. I mean, I hope so.<br> Maybe you can teach us both,<br> you know what I mean?<br> And I also mentioned how generous<br> it is, what I'm doing for you.<br> Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's<br> really generous.<br> You know, being<br> of service.<br> Yeah. To your need.<br> Uh-huh.<br> All right, let's start simple. Start<br> at that corner, walk towards me.<br> Walk across the room.<br> Can we do something else<br> besides the dance deal?<br> Are you fucking<br> kidding me?<br> I'm good with a hammer. You want me<br> to fix something? A deal is a deal.<br> I know. Okay. I was just suggesting<br> that maybe there's a better scenario.<br> Why don't you walk towards<br> me like I'm Nikki.<br> And the only way to<br> convey how much you've<br> missed me is by your walk.<br> By your slow walk.<br> You can't talk. Only walk.<br> I'm not doing it. Do it.<br> No. That's stupid.<br> No walk, no letter. Walk to<br> me like I'm Nikki, come on.<br> Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.<br> You're not Nikki.<br> Don't look up until<br> you're halfway here.<br> Yes. Do you feel that?<br> That's emotion.<br> I don't feel anything.<br> Has anybody ever told<br> you how Tommy died?<br> We were married for<br> three years and<br> five days, and I loved him. But for<br> the last couple months, I just<br> wasn't into sex at all. It just<br> felt like we were so different and<br> I was depressed. Some of that is<br> just me, some of it was he wanted<br> me to have kids and I have a hard<br> enough time taking care of myself.<br> I don't think that makes me a criminal.<br> Anyway one night after<br> dinner, he drove to Victoria's<br> secret at king of prussia mall and<br> got some lingerie to get something going.<br> And on the way back, he<br> stopped on 76 to help a guy with a<br> flat tire and he got hit by a car<br> and killed. And the Victoria's<br> secret box was still in the front<br> seat. That's a feeling.<br> aHruaia<br> Whoa! Slow down. What?<br> Your father wanted<br> you to have this.<br> He wants me to have-all<br> this eagles information.<br> It's his living. Um,<br> tell dad thanks.<br> Your father expects to<br> spend time with you, pat.<br> Football stays out of this place,<br> so does "lord of the flies.".<br> Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing?<br> I'm behind on my syllabus.<br> I don't give a fuck. What the<br> hell are you doing? Hey, hey!<br> Did you just throw<br> that outside?<br> What? You're not gonna<br> read that shit on my time.<br> I can tell you all<br> about the "lord of the flies. "It's<br> a bunch of boys on an island and<br> they have a conch... they have a shell.<br> And whoever has the conch<br> has the power and they can talk.<br> And if you don't have the conch,<br> then you don't have the power. And<br> then there's a little chubby boy,<br> and they call him piggy and they're<br> really mean, and then there's a<br> murder. I mean, humanity is just<br> nasty and there's no silver lining.<br> Wow. That was a great synopsis. I<br> still need to read it, though.<br> Who's that? What the...? What<br> are you doing here, man?<br> If one of your two supervising<br> physicians loses their license,<br> then your whole ajudication<br> is thrown out.<br> How'd you know<br> we were here?<br> I went by your parents' house<br> looking for you and they told me<br> you was over here.<br> Danny, this is Tiffany.<br> Tiffany, this is Danny.<br> Hello. Pat told me about you. So<br> is the girl, that you wrote about?<br> Yeah. What? He wrote about me?<br> I'm "the girl?<br> He wrote about you, all right.<br> What'd he say?<br> He said you guys was helping each<br> other out and you were nice and had<br> a mouth on you, that<br> you were mouthy, but-<br> whoa, whoa, that's enough.<br> No, please, tell me more about<br> what he said in the letter.<br> Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll<br> just tell you. It was nothing.<br> It was just a very<br> general letter.<br> Cool. She's fine. She is<br> my friend with an "f.".<br> A capital "f. "For "friend.<br> .<br> Hey, can I see what<br> you guys are doing?<br> Yeah. Okay. That's it?<br> Why? What is it, what<br> is it, what is it.<br> Can I say something?<br> Do you mind? No.<br> You sure? Just say it.<br> Say it.<br> No, please. I think pat, you<br> should be facing Tiffany.<br> Let me show you, pat, let me show<br> you what I mean. You gotta come at<br> her with a little<br> bit more soul, man.<br> You should move more hips.<br> Just, just sort of come in,<br> pat, come in like this. And...<br> Okay. Yeah. Can you move<br> 'em a little bit more?<br> Yeah, that's it.<br> Move 'em a bit more.<br> You could turn around, too,<br> there's nothing wrong with that.<br> Yeah. You're pretty good.<br> Mm, yeah.<br> Okay, we got it, we got it.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Come on, pat, come on. A<br> little bit more soul.<br> Black it up, pat.<br> "Black it up? You know<br> damn well what it means.<br> I got an idea. Come get some, pat.<br> Come get some.<br> Shuffle back, shuffle back.<br> Shuffle back, shuffle back.<br> Girl, you gotta<br> move your junk.<br> I gotta get out of here. I<br> gotta go see this girl, Tanya.<br> She lives on this<br> side of town.<br> Yeah, go see Tanya.<br> Good idea.<br> Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man.<br> I want you guys to win!<br> Bye! Excelsior, pat!<br> Excelsior! That's my man.<br> Lets go!<br> Pat. Patty.<br> Where have you been?<br> Huh?<br> We got a serious situation<br> on our hands, you know that.<br> We gotta beat the giants if we wanna<br> have a chance of getting into<br> the division, any chance of playing<br> in the playoffs. Do you realize that?<br> I didn't realize that. Yeah,<br> that's the bind we're in.<br> I mean, I think it would be wise if<br> we spent father-son time, reading<br> about the eagles, talking about<br> them, just to strengthen the good<br> luck thing that you're in.<br> Okay. Yeah? Right. Hmm?<br> I just wanted to, maybe I didn't,<br> spend enough time with you growing<br> up. I spent too much<br> time with your brother.<br> It might have made you<br> feel worse about your behavior, but<br> I didn't know anything, I didn't<br> know how to handle it.<br> I mean, that's what<br> all this eagles stuff<br> is about. It's about us, spending time now.<br> I wanna do everything I<br> can to help you get back on your feet.<br> That's the whole point. Yeah.<br> I wish you'd watch these games with me so<br> we could talk, we could get into things.<br> So would you, would you<br> just come downstairs<br> and talk to me<br> and Randy now?<br> Randy, tell him<br> what I'm doing.<br> He's betting everything on the giant game.<br> Everything.<br> All the money that he needs for the<br> restaurant, he's betting on the giant game.<br> Tell him why. Because he believes in you.<br> Is that true?<br> I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you.<br> I want you to know that.<br> So I'm gonna bet<br> heavy on this game.<br> You understand? Yeah.<br> Heavy. I want you to go to<br> the game with your brother.<br> You want me to go to<br> the game with Jake?<br> Of course I do. Does<br> he want me to go?<br> Of course he<br> wants you to go.<br> He told you that?<br> He told me, yes.<br> Even with all his friends? With<br> all his friends. He trusts you.<br> He's not embarrassed?<br> No. I'd love to go to the game,<br> too, but as you know, I'm banned<br> from the stadium. 'Cause I'd love<br> to see us beat the giants and take<br> a lot of money<br> from this asshole.<br> Listen, personally, I<br> think it's a stupid bet.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I think it's ridiculous to bet all that<br> dough for the restaurant on a game.<br> Randy. I just hope you heard what I said.<br> It's like a<br> family business, it's our family endeavor.<br> We all stick together on this.<br> That's how it works. That's<br> a positive, positive vibe.<br> I made a commitment to Tiffany about<br> a project, and we have a very<br> important part of it that we<br> have to go over on Sunday, and<br> it's good for me, dad. It's making me<br> disciplined and focused, and it's,<br> it's..., I never would've thought<br> this, but it's a good thing.<br> What is this thing<br> you're doing?<br> Yeah, what is it? What<br> is this project, hon?<br> It's a dance thing, okay? There's<br> nothing more to it, dad. I swear.<br> Listen, I need to<br> ask you something.<br> Tomorrow can I spend half the day with<br> you and half the day at the eagles game?<br> I'm gonna pretend that you<br> didn't just ask me that.<br> Why? These are the two days that you<br> have promised me and that we have<br> prepared to nail the big move.<br> It's not ready yet.<br> And we don't<br> have a move yet.<br> I know, but my dad opened up to me<br> and it was really beautiful and I<br> wanna be of service to him, okay?<br> And he's worried that the juju from<br> the eagles is being fucked up and<br> he's concerned that it's because<br> I'm spending<br> time with you.<br> Oh, I messed up<br> the eagles' juju?<br> No, you're not messing up the juju,<br> but the juju is messed up because<br> I'm not with him<br> during the games.<br> Guess what? What?<br> Nikki replied to your letter. But<br> you can't read it until after<br> you nail the big move. Go.<br> Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do<br> anything else without reading.<br> Nikki's letter, okay? It's just...,<br> it's in the back of my head.<br> We don't almost<br> have it, all right?<br> I just hope you can handle it.<br> Thank you.<br> What was her energy when<br> she gave it to you?<br> She was intrigued, excited,<br> and a little scared.<br> She was scared? About what?<br> Did she tell you?<br> Try to stay positive.<br> I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay?<br> Because if she says anything<br> that's, you know, is<br> that too much to ask?<br> No.<br> I thought you were gonna<br> read it out loud.<br> Okay. Sorry.<br> "Dear pat,."<br> It was very emotional for me<br> to get your letter, as I'm<br> sure you can imagine, but I'm glad<br> you took the risk of discreetly<br> getting it to me<br> through Tiffany.<br> This gives us a chance<br> to communicate while I<br> keep the restraining<br> order until I feel safe.<br> I must admit you sound terrific<br> and I'm happy that you are<br> feeling so positive and becoming a<br> more loving and caring man, which I<br> always knew you were.<br> I was moved to read about<br> 'excelsior' and your<br> belief in happy endings. I am also<br> moved by your act of love to read<br> the books I have taught at the high school.<br> I'm sorry you find them so<br> negative, but I disagree. I think<br> they are great works of art that<br> reflect how hard life can be and<br> they can also help kids prepare<br> themselves for the hardness of life.<br> In spite of all these<br> positive developments, pat, I have<br> to say if it's me reading the<br> signs, I need to see something to<br> prove you are ready to resume our<br> marriage. Otherwise I find myself<br> thinking that we might both be<br> better off moving on with<br> our lives separately.<br> Please don't react quickly<br> to this, but take time<br> to think about it.<br> I'm glad you're doing so well.<br> Love, Nikki."<br> I think I'm done<br> for today, okay?<br> She said to show<br> her something,<br> pat. This dance can be that something.<br> You would have never<br> done something like this<br> in a million years.<br> It shows all kinds<br> focus, collaboration,<br> discipline. It's romantic, like I<br> said it would be. It's for her.<br> Thanks for the letter. I'll<br> see you tomorrow, okay?<br> Can I use your phone?<br> Is it an emergency?<br> Yeah, kind of. What<br> kind of emergency?<br> Well, I'm just doing this project<br> with Tiffany and I wanted to tell<br> her I'm not gonna<br> be on time.<br> Just don't make her an emergency,<br> that crazy girl, you know?<br> She's not crazy... I'll just borrow<br> Jake's phone. It's too bad you<br> can't come in to the stadium, but I<br> know you were kicked out, you know,<br> for beating everybody up. Guess<br> we're not that different, huh, dad?<br> That a bad thing?<br> No, I think, it's<br> a good thing.<br> Don't drink too much. Don't hit anybody.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Yeah. I'm solid.<br> This is my little<br> brother pat.<br> Hey, how you doing?<br> So, pat, what's this I hear<br> about you just gettin' out?<br> Yeah, from the looney bin!<br> What the fuck?! I talked<br> to you about that already!<br> I told you guys-it's<br> all right.<br> Huh? No. It's alright.<br> He's a good dude!<br> He's a good dude.<br> Oh, shit! The<br> Asian invasion!<br> They're here every week!<br> No!<br> Uh, Jake you better<br> get your brother.<br> Cuckoo bird's takin' off.<br> Doctor patel!<br> Pat! Hey! What are<br> you doing here?<br> You know, we must beat<br> the giants, my brother.<br> I'm not supposed<br> to be seeing you,<br> right? Outside the office?<br> Pat, pat. That's illegal!<br> Pat, today I'm your brother in<br> green, not your therapist. I'm so<br> happy to see you. How<br> wonderful that you are here!<br> Hey, Jake this is cliff.<br> This is my doctor, cliff.<br> Look, two things. We gotta watch<br> that bubble screen for fuckin'<br> Manning in the backfield and we<br> gotta make sure we knock the<br> receivers on their ass on<br> the line of scrimmage.<br> You can say that again.<br> Those cocksuckers!<br> Okay, you know what? I don't have<br> her phone number. If you want, if<br> you really want, you can call<br> Veronica 'cause she does, but I<br> don't want to<br> talk to Veronica.<br> Why don't you wanna<br> talk to Veronica?<br> Because she brings me down, man!<br> She just brings me down.<br> You have to change. You're not<br> gonna throw the marriage away.<br> There's some kind of love there.<br> I know, I used to see it.<br> You guys have a beautiful thing<br> that got broken somewhere along the<br> line and you gotta fix<br> it like a chiropractor.<br> You gotta give it a<br> chiropractic adjustment.<br> Enough with awkwardness! I don't<br> wanna walk in your house and not be<br> able to say what<br> I wanna say.<br> You're right, man. You're<br> right, you're right,<br> eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!<br> What the fuck?<br> What's that smell?<br> Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby!<br> Go back to your country!<br> What, what's wrong? Hey!<br> Whoa, whoa, what's going on?<br> Stay back, pat. Stay back.<br> Leave the fucking Indians alone.<br> Stay here, stay here!<br> I'm not gonna go anywhere.<br> Don't get in a fight!<br> I'm not gonna fight.<br> I'm not gonna fight.<br> Hey, not my brother!<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Break it up or<br> you'll be arrested!<br> What'd you do? What happened?<br> Dad-<br> what the fuck happened?<br> Dad.<br> The birds lose, I lose a fuckin'<br> fortune, a fortune to Randy!<br> What the fuck did you do?!<br> You fucking lost it!<br> I thought you said you had it together!<br> You were solid!<br> I am solid. I was solid<br> at the game, dad.<br> I'm solid, I'm solid now.<br> You fell apart! What are you<br> fucking talking about?!<br> Your son was trying to-<br> it's all fucking ruined now.<br> It's all ruined.<br> No, dad! It's all fucking ruined now!<br> It's all fucking ruined!<br> No, dad, dad, dad, don't!<br> It's all ruined, you<br> little fucking shit!<br> No, dad! I didn't do a fucking thing!<br> Come on, dad!<br> You loser! You loser!<br> I'm not a loser.<br> You fucking loser! You<br> ruined everything!<br> He was defending<br> his brother!<br> You fucking idiot! You spike<br> the ball on the one yard line,<br> who is this?! Who's this?!<br> We need to talk right now! When<br> you make a serious commitment to<br> somebody, it is not<br> cool to not show up!<br> Wait a second, I tried to call,<br> my God, what's happening,<br> I called..., but I tried<br> to call you, Tiffany, I-<br> oh, really? Yes.<br> I told you I was gonna split my<br> time with my dad and you, and my<br> dad was pulling me in one direction.<br> Doctor patel, Ronnie-<br> well, that sounds great, pat.<br> That's great for all of them, but<br> all of them didn't make a commitment<br> to me in return for my help.<br> I'm Tiffany, by the way.<br> What is this craziness<br> with Tiffany Maxwell?<br> There's no craziness. I<br> told you who she was,<br> I was doing this thing with her.<br> We had a conversation!<br> She's fucking nuts! When you<br> started spending time with her,<br> it all fell apart. This is the<br> fucking reason right here.<br> You think I fucked up the<br> eagles' juju, don't you?<br> Ever since, ever since he<br> was with you, ever since-<br> you think that I'm why<br> today's happened?<br> That's right, you are<br> why today happened.<br> I'm the reason why<br> today happened?<br> I think so. Let's<br> talk about that.<br> Be my guest.<br> The first night that pat and I met<br> at my sister's, the eagles beat the.<br> Forty niners handily, forty to twenty-six.<br> The second time we got<br> together we went for a run and the<br> Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to<br> five in the nlcs.<br> She's right, dad.<br> The next time we went for a run the<br> eagles beat the falcons, twenty-<br> seven to fourteen.<br> Wow.<br> The third time we got together we<br> had raisin bran in the diner and<br> the Phillies dominated Tampa bay<br> in the fourth game of the world.<br> Series, ten to two.<br> Oh, wow.<br> Let me think about that.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Well, why don't you think about<br> when the eagles beat the seahawks,<br> fourteen to seven.<br> He was with you? He was with me.<br> We went for a run.<br> Really? That's crazy.<br> There have been no games since pat<br> and I have been rehearsing every<br> day and if pat had been with<br> me like he was supposed to, he<br> wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he<br> wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the.<br> Eagles beat the<br> New York giants.<br> She's making a lot of sense, pop.<br> That's all right on all counts.<br> Does anybody here happen to know<br> what the official motto of the<br> state of New York is on the official<br> seal of the state of New York?<br> Huh? Anybody? Do you?<br> Do you know?<br> "Excelsior." Look it up.<br> Yeah, "excelsior." Oh pat.<br> Not that I give a fuck about<br> football or about your<br> superstitions, but if it's me reading<br> the signs, I don't send the.<br> Eagles guy whose personal motto is<br> "excelsior," to a fucking giants<br> game, especially when he's<br> already in a legal situation.<br> Unbelievable. Wow. How did<br> you know all that stuff?<br> I did my research. Well, I<br> gotta say, I'm impressed.<br> Thank you.<br> I gotta rethink this whole thing.<br> I didn't trust it before,<br> but I gotta say, now I do.<br> Oh, now you like her, dad?<br> I have to say I do. Yup.<br> Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?<br> You made the bet, I won a lot<br> of money, and now look, your<br> whole family is in turmoil.<br> Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.<br> You live for this shit. You've been<br> betting against my<br> father for years.<br> Is that right?<br> You're twisting the knife right now.<br> You get off on it!<br> That's bullshit! That's not true!<br> Don't say that!<br> You get off on it! If not,<br> then prove it. Prove it.<br> Yeah, prove it, prove it!<br> How do you want me to prove it?<br> How's he gonna prove it?<br> By giving them the chance to win<br> back everything, double or nothing.<br> No, no, no, no,<br> no, no, no.<br> Double or nothing on the<br> bengals, next week?<br> Is that what you're saying?<br> Against the cowboys.<br> That's your team isn't it, Randy?<br> That's his team!<br> I know who his team is.<br> When is the game?<br> December twenty-eight,<br> last game of the season.<br> Oh, my God. Same day as<br> the Benjamin Franklin.<br> Pairs open freestyle<br> dance competition.<br> Oh God. Randy, I thought<br> they were America's team.<br> Don't you believe<br> in America's team?<br> Yeah, Randy, don't you<br> believe in America's team?<br> Yeah, I believe in America's team<br> but if I win that bet, I win your<br> book, you're out of action, you<br> get no restaurant, no nothing.<br> I like it. No.<br> No, patrizio-<br> I believe in the eagles,<br> I believe in my son,<br> I'll take the action.<br> I'll take it.<br> Dad! Patrizio, don't!<br> It's toxic!<br> I have faith, I have faith.<br> Excelsior belongs in this house-<br> dad... not in the state of New York.<br> In this house.<br> Dad, listen to me. I didn't know<br> that "excelsior"was the state<br> motto of New York, okay?<br> I didn't know, either,<br> but now I know.<br> I know, but listen to me, this is toxic.<br> Dad, dad, dad, this is<br> toxic, you shouldn't be doing<br> this, you shouldn't be doing-<br> Randy, what do you say...<br> Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough.<br> Randy, what do you say?<br> My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team<br> favored by one and a half points.<br> I 'll give you three more.<br> Patrizio, stop it! And Randy,<br> don't you take the bet!<br> In fact, I'll give you ten points.<br> No, dad! Dad!<br> Dad! You have to take<br> that bet on the cowboys.<br> Dolores, would you stop him?<br> Jesus!<br> How could you not take that bet?<br> Even with the ten points I give<br> you, that's an insane spread<br> to your advantage. Cowboys are<br> cowards. And I'll bet you're such<br> a coward, you won't take the ten.<br> Plus, are you listening, plus<br> whatever their score is at the<br> dance thing. What's that?<br> Tiffany, what's that?<br> What? No, no, no, no. You're<br> crazy to give away that many<br> points. That's ridiculous!<br> I won't take that!<br> However, wait a second. I do<br> like the idea of a parlay.<br> What? No parlay! No! No, don't do it.<br> Don't do it.<br> Pat, how do they run<br> this dance competition?<br> I mean, how do they score<br> it and everything?<br> I don't know, I don't know<br> how they fucking score!<br> We're participating.<br> We're not, we're not a part of it.<br> There are people, this is a high-<br> end dance contest. I don't know. Do<br> not put it as part of the parlay,<br> Randy. Don't-they go by<br> the Philadelphia rules.<br> Each dancer is scored on a scale of<br> one to ten, ten being the highest.<br> You have to average the<br> four judges' scores.<br> Okay, score is from one to ten, right?<br> And you guys are how good?<br> We suck. We don't suck.<br> Pat's a beginner,<br> I'm okay, we're happy<br> just to be going there.<br> And how are the people<br> you're competing against?<br> They're good. Some of<br> them are professionals.<br> They're good? Better than you?<br> A lot better.<br> A lot better. So if I was to say<br> you only have to score five,<br> I would be really<br> very generous, right?<br> No, no, that would be<br> amazing if we got five.<br> Let's not get away-<br> oh, come on, we can get<br> a five out of ten!<br> Gimme a break!<br> Gimme me a break!<br> We can't get five! Give 'em a five.<br> Give 'em a five.<br> We can do a five.<br> What are you talking about, dad?<br> You haven't even seen us dance!<br> That's the parlay.<br> Will somebody please explain<br> to me the parlay? Please?<br> You gotta win two bets or you lose<br> the whole thing. For pat sr. To<br> win, the birds gotta beat the<br> cowboys plus pat and Tiffany gotta<br> get at least a<br> five at the dance.<br> That's very, very manic indeed.<br> That's the parlay. Shake on it.<br> You know what? I'm not gonna<br> be a part of this. Randy,<br> Randy, you're a sickness. You're a<br> fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.<br> Pat, you can't quit. I'm not<br> doing the dance. I'm out.<br> Pat, calm down. Thank about it.<br> See you later.<br> Pat, no. What<br> are you doing?<br> Pat. I'm out.<br> Here we are again at the one yard line.<br> Desean, snatching defeat from<br> the jaws of victory.<br> There you go.<br> What does that even mean, dad? I'm<br> not gonna make that, that, that<br> connection that you're making with<br> desean Jackson. It doesn't matter<br> anymore okay? Just because I<br> have the fucking Jersey on...<br> I'm not gonna do it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You are not a stand up guy right now.<br> If it's me reading the<br> signs... if it's me<br> reading the signs-<br> if it's you reading the signs?<br> You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.<br> Pat! You are not<br> a stand up guy!<br> Pat! I told you<br> not to push it.<br> Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing.<br> He can't be a quitter.<br> He cannot be a quitter.<br> You took that stupid parlay thing,<br> and now he won't do the dance and<br> it was very constructive for<br> him, and you ruined it.<br> There's only one way<br> to get him to show.<br> What's that? Oh,<br> what's that?<br> We have to tell him<br> Nikki's gonna be there.<br> We have to tell him<br> that she's going.<br> But that's a lie!<br> It's a white lie.<br> It's a white lie, what's that matter?<br> That's no big deal.<br> So it's a little lie.<br> There's no other way.<br> You know, we gotta leave a<br> trail of bread crumbs so that.<br> She won't come. She can't come. We<br> have to tell him that she's coming.<br> He can live his life<br> without ruining it.<br> No. I don't approve.<br> You can't do it.<br> Well, you know, I didn't approve<br> when you called her and you told<br> her where he was running, so she<br> could ambush him. I didn't approve<br> of that, but you did it anyway, so<br> I'm doing this anyway. That's it.<br> We're gonna tell him<br> Nikki'll be there.<br> You gotta be part of it.<br> We have to do it.<br> Aren't you nervous<br> to be lying?<br> Yeah. A little bit. But<br> it's for the best.<br> "...but if it was me<br> reading the signs...".<br> That's it. Okay.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, what's up?<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> It's fine.<br> Come on, it's<br> gonna be great.<br> Nikki's gonna be there. You know?<br> Everything's gonna come together.<br> It's what's meant to be.<br> You okay?<br> Don't get wobbly on me.<br> I'm not.<br> We have a dance to do. We have a parlay.<br> You gotta stay focused.<br> I'm focused.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> Look at the dancers. You see them?<br> Shit.<br> Hey, Randy, Jake.<br> What do we got?<br> Dallas just tied with another<br> field goal, three-three.<br> I'm worried about the bet.<br> Don't worry about the bet.<br> I'm worried about the bet.<br> Holy shit.<br> Is this "dancing<br> with the stars?<br> Well, you knew that. Maybe<br> you should've scouted 'em.<br> Look at those<br> fucking dancers!<br> You can give me the<br> money now, you know?<br> Patty, Patty, all we have to<br> do is we have to make a five.<br> That's all. You stay here<br> and watch the game with me.<br> The birds are better when pat is with me.<br> We settled that.<br> Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay?<br> I'll see you in a little bit.<br> I'll see you up there, okay?<br> Okay.<br> Hey, pat, Tiffany!<br> Hey. What a glorious,<br> beautiful occasion, man.<br> Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy,<br> I'll see you. Alright.<br> Wish me luck, man.<br> Excelsior!<br> Wait, what's this?<br> What? I thought you<br> were doing it.<br> Oh, I thought you were doing it.<br> We're doing a dance thing anyway<br> for God's sake.<br> I want you to remember everything.<br> I want you to remember all of the<br> good stuff that<br> we have here.<br> Of course I do. Just check in.<br> I gotta go find Veronica.<br> Hi, good evening. Evening.<br> Check in? How many<br> dancers are there?<br> What?! Nikki? Nikki.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> What the fuck?<br> Sweetie, sweetie.<br> Honey, calm down.<br> You're killing me.<br> You're killing me!<br> Tiffany, please. She'll<br> see how well he's doing,<br> maybe she'll lift the<br> restraining order.<br> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br> Pat told me. He told me you<br> should never throw a marriage<br> out the window.<br> Pat did not say that.<br> He didn't say that.<br> He said it several times,<br> Tiffany, and this is his chance.<br> You gotta give<br> him a chance.<br> Bartender! Bartender, can<br> I get a vodka, please?<br> So, you want another one?<br> Sure.<br> So what do you do? I'm a lawyer.<br> Litigator, actually.<br> Oh, the arguing kind.<br> Seven point six, seven point<br> three, seven point four, and<br> six point nine for an average<br> score of seven point three.<br> Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas!<br> They are on their way to the playoffs.<br> Where's Tiffany?<br> I don't know, mom.<br> Have you seen her?<br> You gotta find her. I<br> know, mom, I know.<br> Hey, what are you doing? She's<br> fine, buddy, she's with me.<br> She's fine? Yeah.<br> Why don't you shut up, okay?<br> How many drinks have you had?<br> I've had two vodkas. Listen,<br> I don't know what choices<br> you've made, but you gotta deal with<br> it right now, okay? We're in this.<br> We're in what?<br> Next, pat solatano<br> and Tiffany Maxwell.<br> You know, I used to think that you<br> were the best thing that ever<br> happened to me, but now I think<br> that you might maybe be the worst<br> thing and I'm sorry<br> that I ever met you.<br> Good for you.<br> And the scores for makarov and tretiak.<br> Six point seven, eight<br> point one, seven point five and six<br> point five for an average score of<br> seven point two.<br> They were great and they<br> only got a seven point two.<br> This is a tough room.<br> Got it.<br> Up next, ladies and<br> gentlemen please welcome<br> pat solatano, Jr. and<br> Tiffany Maxwell.<br> Damn. Let's go, Patty!<br> Come on, pat!<br> Alright, let's see the scores<br> for solatano and Maxwell.<br> We have a four point nine,<br> four eight, a four nine...<br> That's really too bad, guys.<br> That's a lot of fours.<br> And and a five point four for an<br> average score of.. Five point zero.<br> Sorry about that, guys.<br> Dad, dad, did<br> the eagles win?<br> The eagles won, forty-four-six!<br> They won, forty-four-six!<br> Come on!<br> Why are they so<br> excited about a five?<br> How are you? You okay? Good. How are you?<br> I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.<br> You looked really happy out there.<br> Did I?<br> Yeah. Yeah, who'd have<br> thought, dancing?<br> You look incredible.<br> Thank you.<br> You lost a lot of weight. I've<br> been reading your books and,<br> I have a positive attitude. I'm<br> on medication, I'm in therapy.<br> Where's Tiffany? She left.<br> What do you mean, she left?<br> She left. What do you think!<br> Where is she?<br> Let me tell you, I know you don't<br> wanna listen to your father,<br> I didn't listen to mine but I'm<br> telling you, you gotta pay<br> attention to the signs. When life<br> reaches out with a moment like<br> this, it's a sin if you don't reach back.<br> I'm telling you, it's a sin<br> if you don't reach back, and it'll<br> haunt you for the rest of your days<br> like a curse. You're facing a big<br> challenge in your life right now,<br> at this very moment, right here.<br> That girl loves you, she really<br> loves you. And I don't know if<br> Nikki ever did, but she sure as<br> hell doesn't love you right now. I'm<br> telling you, don't fuck this up.<br> I love you, dad.<br> Hey! Would you just<br> leave me alone?!<br> Wait a second! I have one more<br> letter for you to read, okay?<br> What the fuck is the matter with you?<br> Give it to her yourself!<br> Let me say something. You don't<br> ever have to see me again if you<br> just read it, alright?<br> This is so fucked up.<br> Yeah, just read it.<br> "Dear Tiffany...<br> "...I know you<br> wrote the letter.<br> The only way you could<br> meet my crazy..."<br> "...was by doing something<br> crazy yourself. Thank you.<br> I love you.<br> I knew it the minute I met you. I'm<br> sorry it took so long for me to<br> catch up. I just got stuck.<br> Pat."<br> I wrote that a week ago.<br> You wrote that a week ago?<br> Yes, I did.<br> You let me lie to you for a week?<br> I was trying to be romantic.<br> You love me? Yeah, I do.<br> Okay.<br> The world will break your heart ten<br> ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.<br> And I can't begin to explain that...<br> Or the craziness inside myself and<br> everybody else, but guess what?<br> Sunday is my favorite day again.<br> I think of everything everyone did for<br> me and I feel like... a very lucky guy.<br> We have to beat the vikings by three.<br> I'm givin' you a six, which<br> is very generous after the beating<br> you just took. So what are we<br> doin', what are we<br> talkin' about here?<br> I'd like to do another parlay if we<br> make it to the next round, that's all.<br> But we are gonna make it to the next round.<br> We're gonna beat...<br> No, that was me that did that.<br> No that was me.<br> That was me. I played the Jack.<br> So you put the bread crumbs,<br> the garlic in the steak and you<br> roll it up with the toothpicks?<br> Yeah. For, oh, maybe<br> three hours, plus.<br> Everything's good, everything's good, yeah.<br> I got you, you're all down.<br> No, Randy, he's complaining.<br> You know he lost a lot<br> of money. He's moaning and groaning.<br> The restaurant's happening because of Randy,<br> so everything's good.<br> aHruaia<br>
