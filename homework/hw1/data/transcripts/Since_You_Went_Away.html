                        This is the moment I've<br> dreaded... coming back to our home...<br> alone.<br> Oh, Tim. Tim. You've<br> been gone only an hour,<br> and already the<br> house is empty without you.<br> Darling, forgive me.<br> I held myself together<br> through all our good-byes<br> and I've tried to understand,<br> but I still don't know why<br> you should risk your life...<br> you, the best-natured and<br> dearest person in the world.<br> I'll try to remember<br> what you said last night...<br> that years from now,<br> this will seem the<br> greatest adventure we ever had,<br> even though we had it separately.<br> But I have no courage, Tim.<br> You know I have no<br> courage, and I have no vision.<br> And already I'm so very Ionely.<br> We've had at least today.<br> I'll try to keep all the<br> good things as they were.<br> I'll keep the past alive,<br> like a warm room<br> for you to come back to.<br> I promise.<br> I promise.<br> Mother!<br> Mother!<br> - Mother, where are you?<br> - Upstairs, dear.<br> Hello, Mother.<br> Hi, darlings. Are you awfully wet?<br> Jane, such a nice, fresh cheek.<br> Better get your wet things off, Brig.<br> Did Pop get off all<br> right? Was his train on time?<br> It was mean of Pop not to let<br> us go to the station with you.<br> Darling, you know<br> how much he loves you.<br> He didn't even want me there.<br> You know how he hates a<br> fuss. And Louisiana's not so far.<br> And he'll be home on<br> leave before he go...<br> He looked so swell in his<br> cap and uniform, didn't he?<br> I'll bet the others were all<br> jealous. I'd hate a squinchy little father.<br> Pop looks like a parade all by himself.<br> - Did he have my present with him?<br> - Right in his pocket, Brig.<br> I hope he keeps all his<br> money in it and everything.<br> I hope he buys those generals a drink,<br> and maybe he'll be a major by<br> the time he gets home on leave.<br> He can be a major anytime he wants to.<br> Anyhow, he'd probably rather<br> do something else with it anyway,<br> like sending Mother a present or...<br> - Or what, honey?<br> - I don't know.<br> Buy some magazines or books maybe.<br> I wasn't really thinking.<br> I have an idea.<br> How would you like to<br> play gin rummy before dinner?<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Let's not. It won't<br> be the same without Pop.<br> Not even gin rummy... nothing!<br> Hello, Soda.<br> Brig, are you never going<br> to get out of this bathroom?<br> Go fly a kite. I wish<br> you'd wait till I get through!<br> If you don't get through soon,<br> you'll brush the enamel off your teeth.<br> You all stop that bickering.<br> It's time you girls was getting to bed.<br> - Hi, Fidelia.<br> - Hello, Fidelia.<br> - Where have you been all day?<br> - Where's your mother?<br> I'm in here, in Jane's room.<br> All right, princess,<br> the mirror's all yours now.<br> You can have a wonderful<br> time looking at yourself.<br> Evening, Miz Hilton.<br> Did Captain Hilton get<br> away all right this afternoon?<br> Yes, Fidelia. He said he'd send<br> you a postcard from New Orleans.<br> What about you? How did things go?<br> I got that job this afternoon<br> with some lofty people uptown.<br> The wages is mighty<br> fine. I starts right away.<br> But I ain't gonna be contentment.<br> I ain't gonna be contentment like<br> I been right here all these years.<br> I'm afraid we're not going to be<br> very contentment either, Fidelia.<br> What's more, I don't know what<br> kind of housekeeper I'm going to make.<br> I can tell you something.<br> You ain't gonna be very good.<br> I've been figuring out this budget.<br> I don't see how we're going to make it.<br> I've already arranged to sell the car.<br> I don't think the<br> government pays them officers enough.<br> I don't see why Mr. Hilton<br> ain't worth as much to Uncle Sam<br> as he was to that advertising company.<br> You'll probably have a much easier time<br> than you've had taking care of all of us.<br> You're not leaving us?<br> Did we do something to make you mad?<br> Honey, you couldn't do nothing<br> to make me mad, no matter what.<br> You're just like my own child.<br> Did I hear something<br> about Fidelia leaving?<br> Now, Jane, I'm just as<br> unhappy about it as you are.<br> We can't keep up the<br> payments on the house<br> just by cutting down on your allowances.<br> Golly. First Pop, and now Fidelia.<br> That's enough of that,<br> Brig. I don't want no mourning.<br> You say good night to your<br> sister and run along to bed.<br> You, too, Jane. Tomorrow's a school day.<br> The Lord Himself will have to<br> take care of these calamities somehow.<br> You'll come to see us, won't you, Fidelia?<br> Of course I will, child.<br> If you don't pick up your<br> clothes, you never will keep a husband.<br> Men don't fancy disorderment.<br> - Good night for now, Jane, honey.<br> - Good night, Fidelia.<br> Whee! I'm a commando!<br> This is all that's<br> left of Fidelia's last cake,<br> and I'm afraid it's pretty<br> stale, but cake is cake these days.<br> I don't care what they do as<br> long as they don't ration pickles.<br> Yes, I know.<br> You'll have chronic<br> indigestion by the time the war's over.<br> Hi, Gladys.<br> What on earth's the<br> matter with that child?<br> Gladys is afraid of grownups, that's all.<br> I'd like to hear her say two<br> words just to be sure she can talk.<br> Who you talking about... Gladys? I<br> don't see how Brig can put up with it.<br> I don't think much of your friends.<br> They're all man-crazy just like you are.<br> It's too early in the morning to argue.<br> Hurry up. You'll be late.<br> You tell Becky Anderson the<br> next time she tries to high-hat me...<br> - Good morning, Mr. Mahoney.<br> - Good morning, girls.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Hilton.<br> I thought I'd bring the groceries<br> and see if there was anything I could do.<br> That is nice of you. I think<br> I'll need all the help I can get.<br> I hope you won't mind<br> waiting on last month's bill.<br> I haven't received my<br> first allotment check yet,<br> and I'm not a very good manager.<br> I know, everybody's<br> got problems these days.<br> Now, you take me, for instance.<br> I'm trying to get enough of<br> everything for my customers.<br> Would you believe it, Mrs.<br> Hilton... one of them had the nerve<br> to ask me why I didn't<br> go into the black market.<br> - Me, with my boy in the service.<br> - You don't mean Johnny?<br> I wondered why I haven't seen him lately.<br> Yes, ma'am, and he's a mighty fine boy.<br> I've got a picture of him<br> in his uniform right here.<br> I'd love to see him.<br> You're very proud of him, aren't you?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> There are two things that<br> Johnny always wanted to be.<br> One of them was to be an aviator.<br> And what is Johnny's<br> other ambition, Mr. Mahoney?<br> Well, you wouldn't<br> be believin' this maybe,<br> but it's advertising. Advertising.<br> My Johnny always wanted<br> to be an advertising man.<br> Well, I'm sure he'll<br> be very successful at it.<br> You really think that, do you, ma'am?<br> Yes, I do.<br> You do?<br> Well, I guess I'd better be running along.<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Hilton.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Mr. Mahoney.<br> I think Mr. Hilton might like to help Johnny<br> get into the advertising<br> business when the war's over.<br> Now, that is an idea. It<br> wouldn't have occurred to me.<br> Mr. Hilton is in the<br> advertising business, isn't he?<br> And I'm sure he'd be delighted.<br> We've always thought Johnny<br> was a fine, intelligent boy.<br> That he is, ma'am.<br> That and a whole lot more.<br> And you've really given us<br> something to look forward to...<br> me and Johnny and the missus.<br> It was very nice of you to<br> come and visit with me this way.<br> Not at all, ma'am. Not at all.<br> - Mother.<br> - Yes?<br> Do you think that I<br> could be a good secretary?<br> Ha, a secretary.<br> Why don't you be a Wac?<br> You could be their mascot.<br> All right, go ahead<br> and starve. See if I care.<br> Dumb magazines.<br> Everybody's got magazines.<br> I know!<br> Why don't we take somebody<br> into the house... a roomer?<br> If you're going to throw away<br> aces, Jane, that's fine with me.<br> Mother, why shouldn't we rent a room?<br> - There's such a terrible shortage.<br> - Go away.<br> Down with five.<br> It's perfectly ridiculous,<br> Brig. A stranger in our home.<br> Where you get your ideas is beyond me.<br> Certainly it's ridiculous.<br> It's Communism... that's what it is.<br> Oh, pooh. We could get an officer maybe.<br> And it might be sort<br> of like having Pop back.<br> An officer.<br> I think maybe she's right.<br> I understand there's not<br> a room to be had in town.<br> It might be very patriotic of us<br> to take an officer into our house.<br> Patriotism hasn't anything to do with it.<br> You're just crazy about uniforms.<br> We should do everything<br> we can for our soldiers.<br> Brig, Jane, now that's enough.<br> Do you want to finish<br> this game or don't you?<br> - 102. It's a blitz.<br> - Turn out the dining room lights.<br> Suppose Pop were looking<br> for a room in some crowded city.<br> Hurry up, Jane. It can't<br> be that hard to figure out.<br> Suppose there was a family<br> like ours that had three bedrooms.<br> Don't you think it would be<br> malicious not to rent a room to Pop?<br> Well, Jane?<br> I won almost $6,000.<br> Deduct it from what you owe me.<br> And poor Pop sleeping in the park!<br> All right, all right,<br> Pop is sleeping in the park<br> and the people are malicious<br> and we decide to rent him a room.<br> - Now you satisfied?<br> - You'll do it?<br> I didn't say I'd do it. I'll think about it.<br> I knew you couldn't be mean like<br> those characters in that other city.<br> Come along.<br> I wonder how much we<br> can get for Jane's room.<br> My room?<br> How much will that be for three days?<br> What?<br> Brig, turn that thing off. I can't hear.<br> I'm awfully sorry.<br> Yes. Will this get into the early edition?<br> Yes. Fireplace and bay window.<br> Oh, all right. Put in "homey atmosphere."<br> Mother! Mother! Wait, please!<br> Keep quiet, Brig. Would you send<br> the bill to this address, please?<br> Thank you.<br> You don't mean you're<br> going to rent your room?<br> That's the room that<br> will bring the most money.<br> I'll take your room, and<br> you can double up with Jane.<br> You're not going to<br> put somebody in Pop's room?<br> I didn't mean that.<br> You wouldn't want those<br> characters in that other city<br> to put Pop in anything but<br> their best room, would you?<br> But that's different. He's Pop.<br> Good morning.<br> Is this the place that<br> advertised for an officer?<br> That's right.<br> With the real fireplace, nice<br> bay window, southern exposure?<br> That's right.<br> I haven't seen the room yet,<br> but the homey atmosphere seems okay.<br> I guess it's a deal.<br> I'm sorry, but the room's already taken.<br> Oh, I see.<br> I'm sorry you had the trip for nothing.<br> Yes, I can see you're grief-stricken.<br> Hi, beaver.<br> Good morning. Mrs. Hilton, I presume.<br> Yes.<br> May I be permitted to observe,<br> this is the first house I've<br> found in this godforsaken community<br> - That doesn't smell of cabbage.<br> - Well, it does sometimes.<br> I was given to understand at the<br> office of the Purchasing Division,<br> to which I have the<br> misfortune to be attached,<br> that you had a room for rent.<br> Yes, but I specified an<br> officer. You see, my husband...<br> My name is Smollett, William G.,<br> Colonel, United States Army, retired.<br> Retired, I might add, by<br> virtue of certain fatuous opinions<br> held in the War Department<br> which judge a man's usefulness<br> neither by his experience nor his ability,<br> but by the number of<br> years since he was weaned.<br> Soda.<br> There was nothing in the<br> information I was furnished<br> which indicated that you<br> had children and domestic pets.<br> I'm sorry, but they go with the house.<br> We won't discuss it.<br> With your permission, madam,<br> may we dispense with<br> further conversation?<br> I should like to inspect the room.<br> Certainly. Just follow me.<br> I do hope you'll forgive<br> me if I've been long-winded.<br> Not at all, madam.<br> Through a full and<br> somewhat protracted existence,<br> I have learned to<br> accept the natural tendency<br> of all women to be garrulous.<br> You're very tolerant, Colonel.<br> This is an outrage! Mrs. Hilton!<br> Can I do anything for<br> you, Colonel Smollett?<br> - Mother's busy in the kitchen.<br> - Indeed you can, Miss Hilton.<br> You can tell me who had the kindness<br> to leave on my bed this<br> pronouncement from Washington,<br> this lesson in<br> old-world courtesy and manners.<br> I did that, Colonel Smollett.<br> I thought it might make it<br> easier for us to get along.<br> Would you mind<br> helping me with my aquarium?<br> What?<br> Mother's going to use this room. I<br> have to get my things into Jane's room.<br> Now, if you'll just grab that end there...<br> Now you walk<br> backwards and I'll steer you.<br> The big one seems to<br> be the commanding officer.<br> - Don't you think that's intriguing?<br> - Fascinating.<br> It's a little over to the right.<br> Be careful not to shake<br> them. They're very sensitive.<br> You must forgive me<br> if I do anything wrong.<br> This is my first experience hauling fish.<br> Thanks, Colonel. I'll<br> do as much for you someday.<br> I'll tell you what you<br> can do for me, young woman.<br> There are certain<br> elaborate suggestions on page three<br> of this war communiqu<br> concerning the condition,<br> the schedule, and the<br> equipment of the bathroom.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - You do see?<br> Then may I ask you to<br> follow me for a moment?<br> It was my idea that we<br> should take in a roomer,<br> and I'm so glad the whole<br> thing's turned out so super.<br> Since you are so ecstatic<br> over the whole arrangement,<br> may I ask you whether you<br> expect me to bathe under that?<br> Golly, there's a shower off<br> Pop's room... I mean your room.<br> And is it necessary<br> that your paying guest<br> share the facilities of the<br> house with this vegetable life?<br> You don't understand. This<br> is the philodendron Pop gave me.<br> It needs water. I don't think<br> rain water gives it enough nourishment.<br> Really? As soon as<br> there's no longer any danger<br> of pernicious anemia, would<br> you mind removing that topsoil?<br> Yes, and another thing. I<br> neglected to inform your mother<br> that I like my<br> breakfast promptly at 7:00...<br> coffee, thin toast, and two<br> eggs boiled, 21/2 minutes...<br> under no circumstances more than three.<br> We can't afford to give you breakfast.<br> As it is now, poor<br> Mother doesn't know what to do.<br> When Fidelia was here, the bills<br> didn't seem to be so high, but now...<br> Please. I'm quite prepared to pay.<br> That's fine. What would<br> you say to 50 cents a day?<br> - That seems a bit high.<br> - We'll make it $3 a week.<br> There's the doorbell.<br> Let's call it a deal. Good night.<br> But...<br> Let me see...<br> ...a week for rent...<br> ...for breakfast.<br> Fidelia! This is a nice surprise.<br> I thought I'd run down and<br> see how you all was getting along.<br> - Just about the way you predicted.<br> - We miss you, Fidelia.<br> You just give me that apron and<br> let Fidelia finish what you was doing.<br> Nothing of the kind. You<br> must be tired. Now sit down.<br> Child, would you mind running along?<br> I got some troublement I<br> wants to unburden onto your mother.<br> - You go on upstairs, dear.<br> - I'll come up and tuck you in.<br> All right.<br> Mother, remind me to tell you<br> about the momentous deal I made.<br> All right, honey.<br> - Sit here, Fidelia.<br> - Thank you.<br> You see, Miz Hilton, it's this way...<br> them uptown folks is<br> all right in their way,<br> but it's that lazy trash<br> they got working for 'em.<br> Miz Hilton, I just won't abode<br> in the same quarters with them.<br> When I finishes my<br> work, I wants my solitude<br> and I wants my privitation.<br> Fidelia, I'd do anything<br> if I could have you back,<br> - But things aren't any better...<br> - I knows.<br> Your bills is runnin' awful high.<br> "High" isn't the word<br> for it. But how do you know?<br> I hopes you won't think I'm buttin' in,<br> but I been keepin' mighty close touch,<br> and when I heard tell this<br> afternoon about that Colonel Smellett...<br> And here I'm makin' all that easy money,<br> and I reflects maybe you<br> wouldn't mind renting me my old room.<br> Now, you know I'd never<br> take any money from you.<br> That room was always<br> yours, and it always will be.<br> I figured you wouldn't take my<br> money, so I got it figured out.<br> I can work here on my<br> days off, and nights, too.<br> I'm strong as a horse.<br> Oh, no. You're not as<br> young as you used to be.<br> You're not gonna do any work for us.<br> It'll be wonderful just<br> to have you in the house.<br> Miz Hilton, that's the most<br> beautiful thing I ever heard anybody say<br> in all my born days.<br> If you don't mind, I'll just go get my bag.<br> You shouldn't bother<br> going back for it tonight.<br> It ain't no bother, Miz<br> Hilton. It's sittin' right here.<br> This whole moral breakdown<br> is being caused by<br> drinking and nothing else.<br> They certainly serve<br> rotten scotch at this bar.<br> I should go with what?<br> That's what I want to know.<br> The one I was with sure was a dope.<br> He didn't know where he'd been<br> or where he was going or anything!<br> I haven't got anything<br> against red fingernails,<br> but it's carrying it too<br> far when they paint their toes.<br> I bought six dozen<br> before the hoarders got there.<br> I can't write him<br> everything the baby says<br> one one of those little V-mail forms.<br> Emily, let's not go to the<br> bar. I could use a drink, but...<br> Don't be so old-fashioned.<br> Will you let us through, please?<br> I've been here 20 minutes, and...<br> Of course, go right<br> ahead. I was leaving anyway.<br> He's rather nice-looking, don't you think?<br> Still have your weather eye out?<br> There are<br> compensations for being a divorce.<br> Bartender!<br> - Anne, what do you imagine you'd like?<br> - Anything at all. You order for me.<br> You make a good Planter's Punch?<br> I'll make 'em, and if you don't<br> like 'em, you don't need to drink 'em.<br> All right, then two. With light rum.<br> I knew I had<br> something to talk to you about.<br> That vicious tongue<br> Vivian Robinson with the bad skin<br> is saying you've taken in a roomer.<br> I tried to tell her it must be a relative.<br> No, that's the truth. I've taken a roomer.<br> We need the money.<br> If things are that bad,<br> Tim Hilton had no<br> business going into the Army.<br> To be honest, I<br> don't understand it myself,<br> but I knew that Tim was<br> miserable from the start not being in it.<br> All these irresponsible<br> dashing off into uniform.<br> Does it always have to be Tim?<br> - Tony!<br> - Yes. The eternal also-ran.<br> Emily, do you know<br> Lieutenant Willett? Mrs. Hawkins.<br> I've never had the pleasure, but I've<br> always had a soft spot for Navy men.<br> How do you do?<br> I didn't know you'd turned into a barfly.<br> I've been trying to get you on the phone<br> to tell you that your<br> old lover was back in town.<br> Do you want the whole town to know?<br> If you want to be hypocritical about it.<br> I heard that Tim had been shipped out,<br> so I went to the admiral and<br> convinced him I'd<br> chartered the Great Lakes.<br> Fine. How long are we going<br> to be honored with your presence?<br> Long enough to get<br> ready for a shakedown cruise.<br> If you're not stubborn, that<br> ought to give me the time I need.<br> Don't you think so, Mrs. Hawkins?<br> I really don't know, I'm sure.<br> - I think you believe him!<br> - I can't say I blame you much.<br> You're what I call a discerning woman.<br> Tony's our oldest<br> friend. He was Tim's best man.<br> We can give Mrs. Hawkins the<br> vital statistics some other time.<br> Let's get out of<br> here. I need more privacy.<br> - I haven't touched my drink.<br> - We can get another one.<br> Don't let us rush you,<br> Mrs. Hawkins. Good-bye.<br> - What about the check?<br> - Don't bother, Lieutenant.<br> - I'll take care of it.<br> - That's fine.<br> But, Tony... Good-bye, Emily.<br> That was a terribly rude<br> thing to do to poor Emily.<br> Poor Emily, my foot.<br> Do you know of any<br> place in this gay metropolis<br> where I can conquer my<br> two passions at the same time?<br> You've been leading me on. There<br> is someone on the Lakes besides me.<br> Don't be silly. I'm talking about you...<br> you and a nice thick steak.<br> The white fish, signor, is simply delicious.<br> Grilled. You'll like it.<br> Two steaks, thick.<br> Lobster creole, speciality of the house.<br> - Two steaks, thick.<br> - I must tell the truth, Commodore.<br> We are fresh out of<br> steaks since last Tuesday.<br> This is a steak house. It says<br> right here..."thick Kansas City steak."<br> I can't help it, signor.<br> - There is a war on, you know.<br> - There's a war on, you know.<br> Yes, I found that out.<br> Bring us whatever you<br> have... anything but hash.<br> Bravo, signor. You will<br> be very happy. You'll see.<br> What are you<br> looking so depressed about?<br> My life is an endless<br> series of disappointments...<br> no steak, nobody loves me.<br> You wouldn't think so if you'd heard the<br> kids when I told them you were in town.<br> I can't figure out just what<br> special charm you have for them.<br> They have better taste than their mother.<br> I think they believe<br> you're some kind of genius.<br> Those cover girls you used<br> to paint for romantic tales<br> really gave you glamour in their eyes.<br> Gone are the days.<br> Still, there is a certain similarity<br> between a beautiful<br> woman and a battleship.<br> There must be, or else why would<br> you be so interested in battleships?<br> You got me wrong, Anne.<br> As far as I'm concerned, there<br> never was a beautiful woman but you.<br> Ever since that summer the crowd<br> of us went to the Thousand Islands<br> and I first saw you<br> standing on that little yawl.<br> You had on that white<br> bathing suit. Remember?<br> With your hair blowing in the wind.<br> Why, Tony Willett!<br> When did you get back?<br> - Hello, sugar.<br> - Give me a ring.<br> Yes, I will. I will.<br> We were in the Thousand Islands<br> with my hair blowing in the wind.<br> Really, Anne, that was nobody at all,<br> just a girl I happened to<br> meet the last time I was in town.<br> Tony, you don't have to apologize to me.<br> I'd be disappointed if you ever changed.<br> When we get home, I'll<br> show you something to prove...<br> What do you mean, when "we" get home?<br> You certainly mean to put me up?<br> Probably can't get a room anyplace else.<br> The hotels are jammed.<br> Why do these things<br> always happen to me?<br> I don't see why it<br> should be any hardship to you.<br> You ought to have plenty of room.<br> You think you're going to share my room?<br> The girls can double up.<br> The girls have already doubled up.<br> - We have a lodger.<br> - A lodger?<br> Don't start. I had enough of it from Emily.<br> - We needed the money.<br> - Get a job.<br> You look perfectly able-bodied<br> to me, if I may use the word "body."<br> What on earth could I do?<br> You could do plenty<br> if you really wanted to.<br> Let's skip it.<br> I don't want to hear a serious<br> word out of either of us until I leave.<br> Tony, it's so good to see you.<br> Next to Tim being home on<br> leave, it's the nicest thing...<br> There you go again.<br> I buy you a beautiful<br> dinner, and what thanks do I get?<br> Tim. Tim. What's that?<br> Speciality of the house... chicken hash.<br> Well, blow me down.<br> I think Uncle Tony must be<br> the most<br> distinguished-looking<br> officer in the whole Navy.<br> Admiral King's not so bad.<br> I mean young officers, silly.<br> You'd better finish your<br> homework and stop mooning around.<br> And the governor said to<br> the admiral, "16-inch guns?<br> Land sakes, can't they<br> shoot any further than that?"<br> - Uncle Tony!<br> - Jane!<br> What's the matter?<br> You don't seem very glad to see me.<br> But I am. I am. Honestly, I am.<br> - Uncle Tony!<br> - Brig!<br> That's what I call a real reception.<br> - You're not staying with us?<br> - Yes, he's staying with us.<br> Don't go spoiling him. We're<br> going to have enough trouble as it is.<br> Uncle Tony couldn't be any trouble.<br> It's just wonderful having him here.<br> Don't listen to your mother.<br> I'm counting on you spoiling me.<br> There's just one thing, please.<br> Do you think you and Brig<br> could cut out that "Uncle" stuff?<br> I'm not your uncle. It makes me feel 108.<br> You mean we're gonna have<br> to call you Lieutenant Willett?<br> "Tony" to you, Miss Hilton.<br> That must be the taxi driver<br> with that mysterious<br> object you lugged along.<br> You won't be so<br> indifferent when you see what it is.<br> I don't know what this thing is,<br> but could be the side<br> of a house, I suppose.<br> - I ain't got no change.<br> - Don't worry, I borrowed it myself.<br> Thanks, Captain. Thanks a lot.<br> Say, lady, it sure must be<br> nice having your husband home again.<br> Well, he's not my...<br> What's so funny about that?<br> Lmagine anybody taking you for Pop.<br> You think your pop's<br> wonderful, don't you?<br> - Well, he is.<br> - But you don't have to rub it in.<br> I'll take your bags upstairs... Tony.<br> Don't bother, Jane.<br> - I don't mind, really.<br> - Brig, you take one, too.<br> If we don't give the lieutenant<br> service, he might not stay here.<br> - Aye-aye, sir.<br> - Carry on, mates.<br> Put them in Brig's room.<br> I'll move in with you girls.<br> That'll be fun.<br> Fun, indeed. I thought I<br> was through with dormitories.<br> You'll get to know your children better.<br> Who's that?<br> Is there something gone bad, Miz Hilton?<br> I wouldn't call it anything good.<br> If it isn't my old girlfriend Fidelia.<br> Is that Mr. Tony Willett?<br> I thought we was through with<br> you till the duration was over.<br> Lieutenant Willett's going<br> to be our guest for a while.<br> - Happy surprise, Fidelia?<br> - I don't know about "happy."<br> Don't you let these people turn<br> your home into no boardinghouse.<br> Well, Fidelia! I've half a mind not to stay.<br> But the other half tells me to forgive you.<br> - What's that?<br> - I almost forgot.<br> May as well have the unveiling right now.<br> Wait a minute. I wanna see, too!<br> Let's have a little light on it.<br> I offered it to the Navy.<br> - Tony, I am flattered!<br> - That's mighty nice.<br> Mother, it's just like you! And so pretty.<br> Well, it's really not much.<br> I heard they needed new<br> recruiting posters for the Waves,<br> and I figured that your<br> face was the one that...<br> Tony Willett, I might have known!<br> Mr. Willett, you cover that<br> thing right up this here minute!<br> Jane, you's no business looking at that.<br> Tony, the Navy<br> Department didn't accept it?<br> No. I never even found out why.<br> I got the painting back, and<br> the next thing, I was on sea duty.<br> Red tape, I guess.<br> I hope you're having enough trouble.<br> I wouldn't wish this on a Jap.<br> - Give it a little push, Jane.<br> - All right, Tony.<br> - Nice going, Jane!<br> - Tony, I'm so sorry!<br> Never mind, Jane. I'm sure<br> your mother put you up to it.<br> No, honestly, Tony!<br> - Which way do I take this thing?<br> - Starboard on the port side.<br> - Here, I'll help you.<br> - How you gonna get the bed in?<br> - How am I going to what?<br> - We'll put the mattress on the floor.<br> Don't worry, I love to sleep on the floor.<br> Come on.<br> Good evening, Colonel Smollett.<br> I've taken one of the<br> mattresses out of your room.<br> One mattress is entirely sufficient.<br> Colonel Smollett, may I present an<br> old friend of ours Lieutenant Willett.<br> - How are you, Colonel Smollett?<br> - How do you do?<br> I take it your commission is in the Navy.<br> - That's right, sir.<br> - Doesn't surprise me.<br> We'll get the bed set up in the morning.<br> - I'm moving in with the girls.<br> - It's quite all right.<br> I assume you're taking<br> the one I have not been using?<br> - Of course.<br> - That's fine.<br> Is something wrong with one of the beds?<br> It's just that monstrous animal<br> that seems to be so attached to it.<br> Good night.<br> - Mother.<br> - Yes, Jane?<br> Mother, do you think I have a nice figure?<br> Yes, darling.<br> You have a beautiful figure.<br> Do you think Tony<br> might paint me someday?<br> Over my dead body.<br> Wettookit. Wettookit.<br> - You must have the name wrong.<br> - No.<br> Here it is in Pop's letter.<br> "We're here in Texas on maneuvers...<br> "...in a little town called Wettookit.<br> We came, we saw, we took it!"<br> "We took it."<br> Very funny. I would<br> appreciate it, my dear Bridget,<br> if in the future you could spare<br> me from your father's elaborate puns.<br> I suppose to some people, that<br> creature comes under<br> the heading of "pets."<br> I beg your pardon, Colonel Smollett.<br> There's someone here to<br> see you... your grandson.<br> - William?<br> - Hello, Grandpa!<br> To what peculiar<br> combination of circumstances<br> do I owe this visit, William?<br> Well, you see, I was<br> transferred out here to Chamberlain Field.<br> - I found out at your office...<br> - Indeed?<br> I wasn't aware that<br> the United States forces<br> had been honored by your membership.<br> I enlisted, sir, last summer.<br> So...<br> I don't think we need trouble<br> these women with your autobiography.<br> Let's go into the living<br> room. If you will excuse me.<br> Excuse me.<br> I presume you've come to me<br> for help of one sort or another<br> with your tail between your legs.<br> No, sir. I thought you might like...<br> - You see...<br> - Or is it money that you're after.<br> Speak up, boy.<br> I thought you might like to see me.<br> A very mistaken<br> notion if ever you had one,<br> and you've had plenty,<br> as we're both well aware.<br> After all, I thought that we<br> may not see one another again.<br> I don't know when I'll be shipped out.<br> Come, William.<br> Let's not dramatize these things.<br> There's no need for any<br> pretense of affection between us.<br> You've paid your courtesy call.<br> All right, if that's<br> the way you feel about it.<br> I'm sorry to have disturbed you.<br> You may drop me a<br> line with your address.<br> And if you have any<br> affairs that require attention,<br> I shall have my lawyers look after them.<br> For your late father's sake.<br> Now, I am sure you will excuse me.<br> I'm a bit tired.<br> Good-bye, Grandpa.<br> What do you suppose?<br> I'm going in and speak to him.<br> Mr. Smollett?<br> I'm Jane Hilton. This is our home.<br> I see. I'm glad to meet you.<br> I hope you like the Army.<br> That is, I mean, are you on leave?<br> Just for the day.<br> I'll be at Chamberlain for a<br> while, I suppose, until we're shipped.<br> That'll be nice.<br> I don't mean about you being shipped.<br> I didn't mean that either.<br> I hope you don't think<br> I'm a murderer or something.<br> Grandfather just doesn't like me.<br> I don't think it's right. I<br> think it's just terrible of him.<br> He's not so bad. He has good<br> reasons, the way he looks at it.<br> I've kind of disappointed him.<br> I don't care what you<br> did. You're a soldier now.<br> And you enlisted, too. I heard you say so.<br> That isn't really so very<br> much. Lots of men enlisted.<br> But it's awfully nice of<br> you to talk to me this way.<br> Hi, Brig.<br> What's with the colonel?<br> He's storming around his room<br> like one of the Smith<br> Brothers with a hot foot.<br> I'll go up to my<br> room and do some homework.<br> Hello.<br> Uncle... I mean Tony.<br> Lieutenant Willett, this<br> is Private William Smollett.<br> How are you?<br> Corporal. Engineers, isn't it?<br> - Yes, Lieutenant.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - You're related to the colonel?<br> - I'm his grandson.<br> - But I don't know, sir...<br> - Think nothing of it.<br> I cut my grandfather off without a cent.<br> Well, Jane, what's the<br> program for this afternoon?<br> How about you and Brig taking me out?<br> William here... or do they call<br> you Bill? ...could make a fourth.<br> That's nice of you,<br> Lieutenant, but I couldn't.<br> Besides, if you'll forgive my<br> saying so, sir, you're an officer...<br> I forgot all about that. You're right.<br> Let's see, Jane, what could we do?<br> Anything you say, Tony.<br> We could have tea in the garden.<br> That's fine. We could<br> play some darts maybe.<br> Thank you, sir, but I ought<br> to be getting back to the field.<br> You've both been very nice.<br> Next time you're in town.<br> Will you be off next Sunday?<br> - How about it, Jane?<br> - That would be lovely.<br> I'll look forward to it.<br> Well, I'd better be going.<br> - Good-bye, Miss Hilton.<br> - It's nice to know you.<br> So long, and next<br> war, come into the Navy.<br> Thanks. Thank you, sir. I will.<br> Well, good-bye.<br> That seems like a very nice boy.<br> - Yes, he is a nice boy, but...<br> - Now, Jane.<br> You take the word<br> of your old Uncle Tony<br> and be kind to that boy<br> the next time he comes here.<br> - Well, he's nice enough, but...<br> - But what?<br> Well, he's so young.<br> Besides, he isn't even an officer.<br> Why, Jane, I'm surprised at you.<br> Those are the boys who do the fighting,<br> and largely for their<br> dreams of girls like you.<br> Far be it from me to run down officers.<br> You go right on<br> advertising us. Every little bit helps.<br> - Tony, I wish...<br> - What do you wish, little Janie?<br> I wish I were 27.<br> Now, that's a coincidence. So do I.<br> Where's that Brig? Do you<br> suppose she ran out on us?<br> I've got a nickel bet<br> with her on Twenty Questions.<br> Good evening, Mrs.<br> Hawkins. Let me help you down.<br> My, but you're strong, Lieutenant!<br> Here, men, help the young ladies.<br> Yes, sir!<br> Mrs. Hawkins, I'm so frightened.<br> There's nothing to be<br> frightened of. Just go in and dance.<br> This here vehicle<br> got Susie Fleming aboard?<br> But a boy named Spencer<br> was supposed to meet me here.<br> Come on. Just go into the cloakroom<br> and they'll give you your nametag.<br> It's like a great big prom, isn't it?<br> Mind you, Becky, dear, leave<br> a few boys for the other girls.<br> Miss Hilton! Miss Hilton!<br> Come on, Jane. Don't dawdle.<br> Will you tell me when Mother<br> and Lieutenant Willett arrive?<br> Just look for me at the committee<br> table and I'll help you find them.<br> Hello, Miss Hilton. May<br> I have your first dance?<br> Well, I really don't know<br> what arrangements have been made.<br> I just can't figure out what<br> could have happened to Susie Fleming.<br> Would it be too much of a<br> favor to ask you to call me Bill?<br> Well, I don't know you<br> very well, but all right, Bill.<br> - Hello, Emily.<br> - Hello, Anne.<br> Hello, Lieutenant Willett!<br> I'm delighted you could<br> come to our little party.<br> I practically had to<br> tie him up and drag him.<br> He was afraid there<br> wouldn't be another officer here.<br> There are a few.<br> You should see Captain<br> Higgs. That profile... c'est jolie.<br> But I do believe you're the<br> only Naval man in the place.<br> I'll bet they give me three<br> cheers and a long periscope.<br> You'll have a good time. Wait and see.<br> I suppose your first dance is with Anne.<br> But remember, the second is mine.<br> That's too kind of you, Mrs. Hawkins.<br> If only I didn't have this charley horse.<br> Naturally, if you're indisposed...<br> I promised Tony he<br> wouldn't have to stay long.<br> If you'll excuse me, I have a<br> number of things to take care of.<br> Emily, would you keep an<br> eye on Jane after we leave?<br> Why, certainly, my dear. I'll<br> devote the entire evening to her.<br> Well, of all the phony<br> battle-axes I've ever met.<br> Now, really, Tony, you asked for that.<br> What am I doing here<br> with all these kids anyway?<br> Why, Tony Willett.<br> When on earth did you get back in town?<br> Hello, sugar.<br> Give me a ring sometime<br> when you're on the loose.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> As I was saying, what am I<br> doing here with these kids?<br> That was a cute kid, too.<br> It's just a girl I went to college with.<br> I'll bet.<br> - I'm Johnny Mahoney.<br> - Of course! How are you?<br> Lieutenant Willett,<br> this is Johnny Mahoney.<br> Your father told me you<br> were stationed out here.<br> Dad bores everybody talking about me.<br> He has every right to brag about you.<br> Well, I don't know about that, Mrs. Hilton.<br> I wanted to thank you for what you said<br> about Mr. Hilton helping me after the war.<br> I thought maybe you might<br> think I was taking advantage.<br> I didn't want you to feel any obligation.<br> There's no obligation, Johnny.<br> Anybody who gets<br> you will be very lucky.<br> I'm afraid the luck's all mine,<br> and that's the way<br> it's been my whole life.<br> I guess I have to be leaving now.<br> I thought the dance<br> was just getting underway.<br> I stopped in to pick up my gunner.<br> I'm taking off in a few<br> minutes. It's just a routine flight.<br> - Good night, Johnny.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Hilton.<br> - Good night, Lieutenant.<br> - Good night.<br> Those kids just break<br> my heart. They're so eager.<br> I know.<br> They expect to come back to something.<br> What do you mean, Tony?<br> Something like they left, only better.<br> Hope they don't get too many surprises.<br> - Hello, Bill.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Hello, Tony.<br> - Hi, Janie.<br> Mother, I don't believe<br> you've met Bill Smollett.<br> I'm so sorry I missed you<br> at the house the other day.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Hilton. Your<br> daughter has been very nice to me.<br> Well, that's good.<br> You children run<br> along and have a good time.<br> We'll be leaving soon.<br> Tony, aren't you going<br> to dance with me even once?<br> Go ahead, Tony.<br> Jane, I'm really very proud of you.<br> You're the nicest-looking girl in the place.<br> Tony, do you think so?<br> If only I thought you really thought so.<br> Really, I haven't<br> waltzed very much, Mrs. Hilton.<br> - Would you rather we stopped?<br> - Bill, you invited me to dance,<br> and you're going to see it<br> through whether you like it or not.<br> Of course, Mrs. Hilton. I'm only too happy.<br> I think travel broadens<br> one so. Don't you think so?<br> I hope so. I'll be doing plenty of it.<br> Do you think the<br> artistic life is too bohemian?<br> Indeed I do.<br> And look what happened to Bohemia.<br> - Did you lose something?<br> - Yes, ma'am. Susie Fleming.<br> I'm beginning to get<br> right worried about her.<br> I just love modern<br> American painting. Don't you?<br> You're the true American art, darling.<br> Nobody else ever says things like you.<br> I'm so sorry, sir.<br> My fault. I ought to<br> watch where I'm going.<br> It's all right. We know you didn't mean it.<br> - It's over.<br> - And very nice it was, too.<br> Jane, I think I ought to be behind you.<br> I hope we can find Mother and Tony.<br> What do you think you're doing anyway?<br> I ain't used to dancing.<br> I'm used to pushing a plow.<br> You're not kidding.<br> I bet Emily put some vinegar in this.<br> If you're not careful,<br> I'll think you don't like Emily.<br> As soon as we leave here,<br> you better buy me a drink.<br> That's the least I'm entitled to.<br> Hello, Tony. I didn't<br> know you were in town.<br> Hello, Sam. It's quite a<br> dance you fellows are putting on.<br> - You look upset.<br> - Just got some bad news.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Hilton.<br> - Good evening, Major.<br> Plane crash. Don't say<br> anything. It might spoil the fun.<br> That's too bad. Where'd it happen?<br> Right outside town.<br> Lost one of my best boys.<br> - What was his name?<br> - Mahoney.<br> - He hit some wires.<br> - Not Johnny!<br> - Did you know him?<br> - But it can't be!<br> We were talking to him<br> just a little while ago.<br> I'm extremely sorry, Mrs.<br> Hilton. I had no idea that you knew him.<br> I shouldn't have said anything.<br> It was just that I liked Johnny very much.<br> - I know his father.<br> - A terrible thing.<br> Beg your pardon, sir. The car's ready, sir.<br> - Be right there.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I've got to go and examine the wreck.<br> Not a very pleasant job, I can tell you.<br> - Good night.<br> - So long, Sam.<br> Tony, how awful.<br> His poor parents.<br> Lucky Johnny.<br> Come on, Anne, let's dance.<br> Dance?<br> Look, Anne, you'll be<br> hearing plenty of things like this.<br> Might as well get used to them now.<br> I feel so good! Don't you feel good?<br> Well, now, my Susie... she's<br> what I'd call a one-man woman.<br> I love to read books.<br> They're so significant.<br> Why do they call you<br> Wolf? Is that your nickname?<br> You hear what they're playing?<br> Yes. Together.<br> As I remember, you and Tim drove<br> everybody crazy wherever you went,<br> having them play the<br> thing over and over again.<br> Please, Tony, whistle something else.<br> I thought that was your<br> favorite... next to<br> Rock of Ages, of course.<br> Don't joke.<br> All right, have it your way... no jokes.<br> - What is your pleasure?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> You wanted a drink. Let's go someplace.<br> - You feel like it?<br> - Sure I do.<br> Honest?<br> No. Frankly, I don't feel much like it.<br> Neither do I.<br> It's pleasant being in a car again.<br> We used to take everything for granted.<br> Now I feel like a king<br> because I can rent one for a week.<br> - It's one of 'em, all right.<br> - You weren't speeding.<br> Have things changed around here?<br> Do you have to be doing<br> something now before you get a ticket?<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> I wish I knew. What's your<br> guess? Gibraltar? New Guinea? Kiska?<br> - You stationed around here?<br> - Yes and no.<br> I don't want to be rude, but<br> we're not in a chatty frame of mind.<br> Would you mind filling out one of<br> those slips and getting it over with?<br> - You weren't doing anything.<br> - I wasn't?<br> What's all this about?<br> It gets so lonely along<br> this road since gas rationing.<br> Say, ain't it a beautiful night?<br> I hadn't noticed it before,<br> but now that you mention it...<br> Guess I'd better be checkin' in.<br> Nice to have met up with you folks.<br> Good night.<br> Get one of them Japs for me!<br> If I lay my hands on<br> one, I'll give him a ticket.<br> He's what Brig would call a character.<br> It can have my vote. Do<br> you realize we're laughing?<br> Well, so we are. What do you know?<br> What, Tony?<br> Sometimes I wish...<br> How'd you like a cigarette?<br> I'd love one. I don't believe<br> I've had a cigarette in a month.<br> I've never had such a<br> dramatic buildup to a cigarette before.<br> You know what I was just thinking?<br> I like you best when you're not thinking.<br> That's right, run me down.<br> Tony Willett, the jolly<br> fellow. Always good for a laugh.<br> You're not really going<br> to be wounded, not by me.<br> No. If you haven't wounded me by now,<br> I guess I'm impervious, Anne.<br> I would like to tell<br> you what I was thinking.<br> All right, what were you thinking?<br> I was just thinking what<br> fun it would be sometimes<br> to be a good, heavy,<br> synthetic rubber heel.<br> It would be synthetic, Tony.<br> Is it all right now if I whistled Together?<br> Go right ahead. I'd like to join in.<br> I just can't believe that<br> by tomorrow, Tony will be gone.<br> There are enough carrots<br> here to feed a cavalry regiment...<br> men and horses.<br> I think next to Pop, Tony must<br> be the nicest man in the world.<br> - Bridget, please.<br> - What, Colonel?<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> I've had enough this morning.<br> In fact, I think that henceforth,<br> you may operate this<br> victory garden entirely by yourself.<br> Golly, what did I do?<br> Since you're so obtuse...<br> "Tony, Tony, Uncle Tony."<br> I'd better look for quarters elsewhere<br> since that's the way<br> I'm regarded around here.<br> Colonel Smollett, I wouldn't<br> hurt your feelings for anything.<br> It's not a question of my feelings.<br> After all, a man does have his pride.<br> There's the postman.<br> Maybe it's a letter from Pop!<br> You'll wait here, won't you?<br> - Mother! Mother! Mother!<br> - What's all the excitement about?<br> It's a letter to Jane and me from Pop!<br> Well, bring it up.<br> Come on, honey, time to get up.<br> Mother, listen! Pop<br> says he may get leave soon!<br> Let me see!<br> What's that about Pop?<br> Look!<br> - Jane, let me look at you.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Darling, I'm afraid you have the mumps.<br> - Mumps.<br> - Mumps?<br> Oh, Mother!<br> Tony's last day.<br> Only children have mumps.<br> You sure you ain't leavin' nothin' here?<br> Just my love, Fidelia. You<br> afraid maybe I'll come back?<br> I ain't sorry you're goin'.<br> Now, Fidelia, I always<br> say nice things about you.<br> I ain't got no time<br> for them complimentaries.<br> Besides, now that Miss<br> Jane got herself some mumps,<br> we need this room<br> for Miz Hilton and Brig.<br> At least give me credit for good timing.<br> Don't bother with that. I'll take it down.<br> I want to be sure it gets down.<br> I've got a going-away<br> present for you, Fidelia.<br> Here it is. Always<br> remember, a great master<br> devoted some of his last hours<br> to you before he went off to war.<br> You like it? I tried not to flatter you.<br> Why, Mr. Willett...<br> it's just the way I always wanted to look.<br> Someday I'll do you in oil.<br> I haven't much time. I want<br> to say good-bye to everybody.<br> You say your farewells.<br> I'll tote your bag for you.<br> That's very nice of you.<br> Mr. Willett, I must have been stone blind<br> not to see what a<br> lovely gentleman you is.<br> - Leaving, Lieutenant?<br> - On my way, Colonel.<br> I'll tell Miz Hilton you's ready, Mr. Tony.<br> I rather envy you, if I may say so.<br> We could use you, sir.<br> In the Navy?<br> - Good luck, Mr. Willett.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I guess we have to have a Navy.<br> - Don't come in, please!<br> - Don't you want to say good-bye?<br> I have an awful disease.<br> Can't scare me. I'm coming in.<br> Wait a minute, Tony, please.<br> - All right, Jane?<br> - Yes.<br> But I wish you wouldn't.<br> Hello, Janie.<br> Hello, Tony.<br> You look fine in that<br> kerchief. Probably start a new fashion.<br> - I look terrible.<br> - No, you don't.<br> You could never look terrible.<br> You're pretty, that's what you are.<br> Don't laugh at me.<br> I never laugh at anybody I love.<br> And I've loved you from<br> the moment you were born.<br> Is that all?<br> It's the best love I have, Janie.<br> It's a special kind of love<br> I keep just for Anne and Tim<br> and the two sweet girls<br> who are part of Anne and Tim.<br> Tony, you're going way<br> and maybe you'll be killed,<br> and I've got the mumps just like a baby.<br> I hope the mumps are the worst<br> things that ever happen to you.<br> I won't be killed. Only the<br> good die young... haven't you heard?<br> And I'm neither good nor young.<br> But, Tony, you're just<br> the right age for a man.<br> Little Janie. Wanna make a bet?<br> What?<br> I'll bet by the time I<br> see you again, you're in love.<br> You're silly. You're the<br> silliest man I ever knew.<br> Now you're making sense.<br> I knew you had a good head.<br> Will you write to me?<br> There won't be anything to write.<br> There won't be anything<br> happening after you're gone, ever.<br> All right. But I'll write to you.<br> I have to go now, dear.<br> Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye, Janie.<br> - Bye, Tony.<br> I'll write to you. I'll<br> write to you all the time.<br> You'll catch the mumps.<br> Do you want to keep<br> them all to yourself?<br> Besides, I'm no hero.<br> I've had the mumps. I'm immune.<br> I wish...<br> Let me wish this time.<br> I wish that I was 17.<br> What are you doing<br> sitting in that holy of holies<br> as though it were yours?<br> I'm getting it used to<br> being just another chair.<br> - Can I wake her up?<br> - You'd better.<br> She'd never forgive you if<br> you left without saying good-bye.<br> If ever I have any children, God<br> will punish me... they'll be boys.<br> I couldn't possibly have<br> anything as nice as that.<br> The first step usually is to get married.<br> - Are you leaving soon, Tony?<br> - In just a little while.<br> Say good-bye to Tony,<br> darling. It's way past your bedtime.<br> I want to talk to him before he leaves.<br> - Good-bye, Tony.<br> - Good-bye, Brig, dear.<br> It's sort of like<br> saying good-bye to Pop again.<br> Coming from you, Brig,<br> that's the compliment<br> to top all compliments.<br> I'll have another kiss on that.<br> - Your cab's here, Mr. Tony.<br> - Thank you, Fidelia.<br> Would you ask him if he'd mind waiting?<br> I got it all arranged. He's waiting.<br> Good-bye, Tony. Come back soon.<br> Good night, Mother.<br> Good night, darling.<br> - Don't catch those mumps.<br> - What do you think I am, a child?<br> - Happy dreams.<br> - Happy landing.<br> - Bye, Mr. Tony.<br> - Good-bye, Fidelia.<br> I'll take myself along now before I...<br> Just when did you captivate Fidelia?<br> It was my art that did<br> the trick. I sketched her.<br> As a Wave?<br> Sometimes your ingratitude saddens me.<br> - You'll recover.<br> - I've got to leave in three minutes.<br> Tony, I'm so sorry to see you go.<br> We've all loved having you.<br> By the way, how did you leave Jane?<br> With the mumps. And<br> with tears, I'm afraid.<br> I haven't much tact, I<br> guess. I didn't know what to say.<br> I know. Poor dear. But<br> you are very attractive, Tony.<br> - A bone from Mrs. Hilton.<br> - No, I mean it.<br> It won't be too easy<br> for Jane, getting over it.<br> Nonsense. Older men... every<br> girl goes through it. Didn't you?<br> - Still going through it.<br> - Yeah. Older men named Hilton.<br> Don't you ever worry about Jane.<br> I won't, as long as<br> the older men are like you.<br> You know something, Anne?<br> I'm chump enough to go on<br> living on your compliments<br> for the next six months.<br> Like a camel and water, you know?<br> - How long can they go?<br> - I never knew one.<br> Tony, don't tell me any<br> secrets, but is it action this time?<br> Down the St. Lawrence, and<br> then I don't even know myself.<br> - I won't say what I feel.<br> - No, don't.<br> You'd better get<br> some rest. You look tired.<br> I will. I have a little<br> letter-writing to do first.<br> I see.<br> How often do you write him?<br> You won't think me foolish if I tell you?<br> I try to write at least<br> a few lines every night.<br> You know that's a little nuts.<br> It's pretty wonderful, too.<br> Well, good night, Anne.<br> Good night, Tony.<br> Come here.<br> You're a swell guy, Tony.<br> Go away.<br> Well, she finally hit one.<br> Now don't drop it. Bowl it.<br> It's no use, Bill. I'll never learn.<br> Sure you will.<br> - I hurt my thumb.<br> - I'm so sorry. Let me see.<br> It's your turn now, Bill.<br> Let's see if you can knock them all down.<br> Well, I don't know about that.<br> Like a piece of tape?<br> Thank you.<br> It's your turn now, Jane.<br> I was just... He just<br> gave me a piece of tape.<br> - Hi, buddy.<br> - Hi.<br> - Have a smoke?<br> - No.<br> I'd advise you to mind your own business.<br> I know she's a nice<br> girl. Anybody could see that.<br> I don't like your laughing either.<br> Bill, please come down and<br> show me again how to do it.<br> Look, buddy, you can<br> have a fight if you want it,<br> but I was just trying to be friendly.<br> Well, all right, then.<br> - Bill, speak to me.<br> - Gee, I'm sorry.<br> - Look what you've done.<br> - I didn't do anything.<br> I guess that'll teach him.<br> You know, I've never been<br> to the beach in my whole life.<br> - I've never seen the ocean.<br> - You haven't?<br> I never saw it till a couple of months ago.<br> But you're a sailor.<br> - I was brought up on a farm.<br> - I see.<br> - I've never been on a farm.<br> - You haven't?<br> I was brought up on an Army post.<br> I see.<br> I have to catch a train.<br> Gotta be back at the base in the morning.<br> Sure wish you could spend<br> the rest of the evening with us.<br> No, you don't. I've<br> butted in enough already.<br> - No, we loved meeting you.<br> - Sure we did.<br> I'll catch a bus here.<br> - So long, buddy.<br> - Good-bye.<br> You've both been swell.<br> You're the only people I<br> met since I came to town.<br> Why didn't you go to the canteen?<br> They're so crowded and<br> everything, and I<br> don't dance so very good.<br> You and me both.<br> Next time you come to town,<br> maybe we can all go bowling again.<br> Gee, I don't know if<br> I'll ever be back this way.<br> I expect we'll get going any day now.<br> The war looks pretty good, doesn't it?<br> It sure does.<br> Well, good-bye, miss.<br> My name's Harold E. Smith.<br> I'm Bill Smollett, and this is Miss Hilton.<br> - How are you?<br> - Jane's my first name.<br> - Good-bye, Jane.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Bye, Harold.<br> - Hal.<br> Bye, Hal.<br> - He's nice.<br> - Yeah, he's a nice fella.<br> You were sweet to him,<br> Bill. I'm sorry about...<br> I acted like a fool.<br> - He's good-looking, isn't he?<br> - Is he? I hadn't noticed.<br> - You must have noticed.<br> - Well, I didn't.<br> Come on, let's get a soda.<br> No chocolate. We only have<br> vanilla flavoring, but no ice cream.<br> - Would you like Victory Punch?<br> - What's that?<br> It's a loganberry phosphate with lime.<br> - That sounds fine.<br> - We'll make it two.<br> But you could have a vanilla<br> soda without any ice cream maybe.<br> That's right, I could, couldn't I? I'll try it.<br> One Victory and one<br> vanilla soda with no ice cream.<br> - Do you mind if I smoke?<br> - Of course not.<br> Bill, why are you<br> so... so timid about things?<br> What do you mean, Jane?<br> I mean about asking if you can smoke.<br> Nobody else does that.<br> And, well, I mean everything.<br> Is it...<br> I hope you won't think I'm being forward,<br> but is it something to<br> do with your grandfather?<br> No, it isn't that.<br> Although I suppose I've always<br> been sort of scared of Grandpa.<br> But why?<br> I dug up a scoop of<br> vanilla ice cream for you.<br> Please pay the cashier and<br> buy war stamps with your change.<br> I will.<br> You see, my father was a soldier.<br> He was a colonel when he died.<br> I guess all the Smolletts<br> all the way back were soldiers.<br> One of them was with<br> Washington at Yorktown.<br> Although sometimes I think<br> Grandpa just made that one up.<br> I'm sure he didn't. You<br> ought to be awfully proud.<br> I'm proud, all right.<br> But something went wrong with me.<br> Mother died when I was<br> born, so I never knew her.<br> Of course I never knew her.<br> That's a shame.<br> She could paint pretty<br> well... china and things.<br> I hope I can show<br> you her work sometime.<br> That is, if Grandpa...<br> If Grandpa what?<br> Well, if I go home.<br> You see, I haven't<br> lived home since West Point.<br> West Point?<br> You don't want to hear<br> all about this, do you?<br> Not if you don't want me to, Bill.<br> But I do, of course.<br> There's no one in the<br> whole world that I'd rather tell.<br> Isn't your soda all right?<br> Yeah. I just don't feel much like it.<br> I thought I did, but...<br> You don't have to drink it, Bill.<br> Would you rather go home and talk?<br> We could sit on the porch.<br> Swell. I'd like that.<br> So would I.<br> There. Now we can relax.<br> You were talking about how your<br> grandfather wanted you to be a soldier.<br> Would you like a sandwich or something?<br> He wanted me to be a general.<br> But didn't you want to be a general?<br> Well, no, I didn't.<br> But why not, Bill?<br> I had an idea it was more<br> important to build things.<br> I don't mean it isn't<br> important being a soldier.<br> I don't know how we'd keep<br> the things we build without them.<br> But you said you went to West Point.<br> I should think you'd be a lot more than a...<br> More than a corporal, you mean.<br> Let's have a picnic sometime. I'll bring a...<br> Bill, I didn't mean that.<br> It's wonderful being a corporal.<br> No, you meant that if<br> I went to the Academy,<br> I ought to be more than a corporal.<br> Well, you might as well know it.<br> I was kicked out and<br> I broke Grandpa's heart.<br> I'm sure it wasn't your fault.<br> Yes, it was.<br> Bill, come and sit down.<br> Look. Grandpa's father<br> carried this watch at Vicksburg.<br> Grandpa gave it to<br> me on my tenth birthday.<br> He had it engraved for me. Read it.<br> I'll light a match.<br> "To William G. Smollett, the Second,<br> who will lead men to<br> glory on the battlefield."<br> You must have been terribly pleased.<br> I said, "Grandpa, don't<br> people hurt each other in war?"<br> You see, I was only ten.<br> He took the watch away from me.<br> But he gave it back to me<br> again when I entered the Academy.<br> Jane, I did my best, but I<br> could never make a good officer.<br> I can't lead men, and I know it.<br> Even if I'd led my<br> class the way Grandpa...<br> "Grandpa, Grandpa,<br> Grandpa." What about yourself?<br> Why is it so important<br> that you satisfy him, the old...<br> Because he loved me so.<br> Yeah, I'm sure he did... once.<br> But all through military<br> school, from the time I was eight,<br> I kept letting him down.<br> I never even wanted to play<br> with the tin soldiers he gave me.<br> Grandpa kept telling me<br> that if I was a Smollett, I'd...<br> But I guess I was<br> always... well, you know... weak.<br> I was a joke at the Academy. I<br> only lasted a couple of months.<br> Grandpa couldn't face his old cronies.<br> Well, that's it.<br> Now you can see what a<br> mess I made out of everything.<br> You've done no such thing.<br> You're fine and strong, but<br> you're just sensitive... that's all.<br> But don't you think I'm a<br> failure after everything I've told you?<br> A failure? Just<br> because you're not an officer?<br> An officer I know said that you<br> are the boys doing the fighting.<br> - Lieutenant Willett?<br> - Yes.<br> You think a lot of him, don't you?<br> Of course, but what's<br> that got to do with it?<br> You're a soldier, and<br> I'm... that is, we're proud of you.<br> And I hope you never get promoted.<br> All those officers strutting around<br> with their gold braid and everything.<br> Gee, Jane, I'm so glad<br> you feel that way about it.<br> But Grandpa...<br> Bother Grandpa!<br> There's Soda. You'd better<br> go before we wake the colonel.<br> He doesn't scare me.<br> Not anymore, he doesn't.<br> Jane, let me stay long<br> enough for just one cigarette.<br> All right.<br> Provided you don't ask<br> my permission to smoke it.<br> I won't.<br> Gee, Jane, I think you're wonderful.<br> "21/2 minutes... under no<br> circumstances more than 3."<br> Sometimes I think six<br> minutes would be more in character.<br> I'll serve the colonel his<br> breakfast this morning, Mother.<br> What's wrong with<br> you this morning anyway?<br> First you get up an hour early...<br> ...and then suddenly you've<br> turned into Mother's little helper.<br> I don't know. I just felt like it somehow.<br> Not that I object. The<br> next time Brig makes a deal,<br> she can put it into execution herself.<br> You don't mind waiting for our<br> breakfast until Brig gets down?<br> Two sets of breakfasts<br> are about all I can handle.<br> Mother, do you like Bill?<br> Yes, of course. I<br> think he's a very nice boy.<br> A little shy. Did you<br> have a nice time last night?<br> If he's shy, it's that<br> colonel's fault, the old goat.<br> That's not a very nice way to talk.<br> Well, he is. He's just<br> ruined Bill, that's what.<br> I'm going to have a talk with him.<br> - I wouldn't do that if I were you.<br> - Why not?<br> Somebody's got to talk to him.<br> It's usually a good rule to<br> stay out of other people's business.<br> But maybe it's better<br> if you learn the hard way.<br> Go ahead if you want to.<br> You're not a baby anymore.<br> Just think, in another<br> week, I'll be graduating.<br> Mother, may I get a war job?<br> You certainly may not.<br> You're going to college.<br> College. But all the girls are<br> talking about getting war jobs.<br> I promised your father<br> and myself that all the things<br> we planned for you are<br> going to come true, war or no war.<br> - But I want to do something.<br> - We're doing all we can, dear.<br> Pop is fighting so that<br> you girls can continue...<br> It is three minutes after 7:00.<br> Here.<br> - See what I mean?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, dear. Here, give him his breakfast.<br> And tell him anything you want to.<br> The old goat.<br> Good morning, Colonel<br> Smollett. Looks like a fine morning.<br> Yes, yes, yes, yes. Where is Superman?<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Pages 9 to 12 inclusive<br> are mysteriously missing.<br> - Where's the other one?<br> - Brig? It's a little early for her.<br> The other egg.<br> That's the only one we have.<br> There's getting to be a shortage.<br> I guess the hens<br> are... busy with war work.<br> Coffee.<br> Do you mind being<br> talked to at breakfast?<br> I most certainly do mind.<br> - It's about Bill.<br> - About whom?<br> Bill. You remember, your grandson.<br> Yes, indeed, I do<br> remember. What about him?<br> He's a nice boy.<br> A most interesting<br> observation, Miss Hilton.<br> I'm afraid you don't understand him.<br> He really needs you to<br> help him, like a mother.<br> He has an inferiority complex, and...<br> Young woman, I have<br> handled men for 35 years,<br> and I don't think I require<br> any instructions on the subject,<br> least of all about my own grandson.<br> I was only trying to<br> help. He respects you so much.<br> Then I'll thank you to do the same<br> and stop your intrusion in my affairs.<br> If you only knew the<br> first thing about psychology,<br> you'd know better than<br> to try to browbeat him.<br> Colonel Smollett, if you'd only listen.<br> You may advise your<br> mother that henceforth<br> I shall have a decent<br> breakfast downtown for 40 cents!<br> I think you're a rude,<br> mean, horrible old goat!<br> Mother!<br> Oh, beautiful for spacious skies<br> For amber waves of grain<br> For purple mountains' majesties<br> Above the fruited plain<br> America, America<br> God shed His grace on thee<br> And crown thy good with brotherhood<br> From sea to shining sea<br> It is now my pleasure to<br> introduce the class president...<br> Miss Becky Anderson.<br> Class president! Class pinup girl...<br> I heard all about how she got elected.<br> That's not fair, Brig.<br> Becky's a very bright girl.<br> Becky's one of the brightest<br> and most attractive girls in town.<br> I wouldn't go so far as to say that.<br> No, ma'am.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests,<br> my subject for this<br> occasion is women's place in the war.<br> Golly!<br> - There's Pop!<br> - I see him!<br> - Where? I don't see him.<br> - He was in a jeep.<br> You imagined it.<br> - No, honestly.<br> - Yes, Mother, really, it was Pop.<br> Why did I fall asleep after staying<br> awake through that double feature?<br> Let's wait and see it again.<br> - Quiet.<br> - Be quiet yourself.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> - Mr. Mahoney.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Hilton.<br> - Sit down.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - How are you, Mr. Mahoney?<br> - I'm fine, thank you.<br> - Hello, girls.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Mahoney.<br> Jones City, Nebraska, turns<br> out to greet Sergeant Tommy Blair<br> of the Army Air Forces.<br> Tommy, seated between<br> his proud father and mother,<br> joyfully receives the<br> plaudits of his hometown.<br> - You say it's animal?<br> - That's right.<br> And its home is in the Middle West.<br> And it makes a noise like a<br> lion but it puffs like a locomotive.<br> Better give up.<br> You agreed if you hadn't<br> guessed it by the time we got home...<br> I know... it's Soda.<br> No. Brig guessed that long ago.<br> All right, I give up.<br> It's Colonel Smollett, silly.<br> Mother!<br> What's that?<br> - Mother, what do we do?<br> - Is he dead?<br> - It's Bill!<br> - Goodness.<br> Bill Smollett, what were you doing there?<br> The poor boy was<br> just guarding the house.<br> I guess I just dozed off.<br> - You scared us half to death.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Won't you come in just for a<br> moment? Jane has to get to bed.<br> Mother, may Bill and I take<br> a walk for just five minutes?<br> All right, Jane. Make it ten minutes.<br> But remember, that doesn't mean an hour.<br> - Thank you, Mother.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Hilton. Thanks.<br> Good night, Bill.<br> Gee, I'm sure sorry I<br> missed your graduation, Jane.<br> It's not your fault you couldn't get off.<br> - I would've if I could've.<br> - I know you would've.<br> - Shall we go this way?<br> - That would be fine.<br> - Or this way?<br> - Okay.<br> No, I think the other way is better.<br> - How are things at the field?<br> - They're fine, thank you.<br> - How's everything with you?<br> - Just fine.<br> I want to get a war<br> job, but Mother won't let me.<br> I think she's right.<br> You ought to stay home...<br> No, it isn't that at all.<br> Mother wants me to go to college.<br> Gee, that would take<br> four years, wouldn't it?<br> If I go.<br> - You don't want to go?<br> - No, it's so silly.<br> If I were three or four<br> years older, I could be a Wave.<br> Or a Wac.<br> Or a nurse. That's<br> what I'd rather be most.<br> That would be swell if I was wounded.<br> You shouldn't say such things.<br> I won't be wounded.<br> I'll be killed.<br> Jane, would you care?<br> Well, of course I'd care, silly.<br> - Well, gee, that'd be fine.<br> - What would be fine about it?<br> Well, I thought that if...<br> What I mean is I would be glad<br> if you were sorry if I were killed.<br> What good would<br> that do if you were dead?<br> Yeah, I guess you're right.<br> I don't ever want to<br> hear you talk like that again.<br> Okay.<br> I'm sure sorry I missed your graduation.<br> The ten minutes aren't up yet.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - A wire from Pop.<br> From Pop? Is anything wrong?<br> He's gonna be someplace<br> for an hour between trains<br> and wants us to meet him there.<br> Hurry! We have to catch a train!<br> Show your tickets, please.<br> - Did I get your ticket?<br> - Yes. My daughters are back there.<br> If we keep stopping, I'll<br> miss the biggest deal of my life.<br> Well, I'm in no hurry.<br> I've got plenty of time from now on.<br> Tickets, please. Yes, I got yours before.<br> My husband's never even seen the baby.<br> - Did I get your ticket?<br> - My mother has it.<br> I think babies are just<br> about the cutest things there are.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Dwight Eisenhower O'Brien.<br> - And after the Germans came...<br> - Tickets, please.<br> And after the Germans came,<br> we did not get any<br> milk or any meat at all.<br> Serving only two meals a day<br> on these trains is outrageous!<br> Tickets, please.<br> Can't we do anything<br> to get this train going?<br> Those supply trains<br> have the right-of-way.<br> We're going to meet<br> my pop! He's in the Army.<br> If this train is late, we<br> may not see him before he leaves!<br> Don't you think those<br> tanks had better get through<br> if you want him to come back?<br> Captain Hilton!<br> Captain Timothy Hilton!<br> Well, he said the lobby.<br> Sorry, ma'am, he didn't answer the page.<br> I can't imagine... Oh, here.<br> What'll we do? We're so late.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> Sorry, there's nothing<br> available until October.<br> Are you sure there's no<br> message for Mrs. Hilton?<br> I'm quite sure, but I'll look again.<br> Maybe he hasn't gotten here yet.<br> - Pop's always so dependable.<br> - It wouldn't be his fault, silly.<br> - You have the right hotel?<br> - Yes, definitely.<br> Yes, here it is... "Mrs. Timothy Hilton."<br> No, I'm sorry. We're all filled up.<br> I can't help it if he is with the OPA.<br> - We missed him.<br> - Mother.<br> "I know you'll<br> understand how heartbroken I am<br> "that my orders<br> wouldn't permit me to wait.<br> Kiss the kids for me."<br> - Is there something wrong?<br> - No. No, thank you.<br> "The only address I can<br> give you is APO number 805,<br> care of Postmaster, San Francisco."<br> Army Post Office.<br> Mother, that means we<br> won't be seeing him before...<br> Oh, Mother!<br> No, no. Sorry.<br> No reservations until October.<br> I'm afraid she's awfully heavy for you.<br> Oh, no. She's so like my granddaughter.<br> I love holding her.<br> Is she about the same age?<br> No. Mary is almost 30 now.<br> She's a nurse. Let<br> me show you her picture.<br> She's pretty. Where is she now?<br> I really don't know.<br> You see, she was at Corregidor.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Mother, won't you<br> let me do something now?<br> Jane, please, darling, not<br> again. I'm so hot and so tired.<br> Just for the summer. I<br> could be a nurse's aide maybe.<br> - All right, Jane.<br> - Gee, Mother, that's swell.<br> But remember now, just for the summer.<br> I embrace the code of the Nurse's Aide.<br> I will do everything in my power<br> to bring comfort to<br> the ailing and the wounded<br> of whatever color, race, or creed.<br> I will accept no<br> compensation and seek no reward,<br> and I will hold as a sacred trust<br> the symbol of mercy<br> which I wear... the Red Cross.<br> "Tell Jane I'm proud of my<br> little Florence Nightingale,<br> "and she must hold the<br> thought that next summer,<br> or the summer after that,<br> we'll be boating again on the lake."<br> The summer after that...<br> "And tell Brig that her candy is<br> all the sweeter because she made it.<br> "But I'm worried about your ration points.<br> You mustn't waste them on me."<br> Waste them on Pop?<br> He's thinking of us, darling.<br> "We get everything<br> we could possibly want.<br> "And don't tell Fidelia,<br> but the grub is wonderful.<br> "I'm gaining a pound a<br> week, and if it doesn't stop soon,<br> "they'll have to make me a<br> general just for appearance's sake.<br> That's all for tonight, except..."<br> - Except for what, Mother?<br> - The rest is to me.<br> Mother, I want to hear it.<br> Can't I have any privacy at all?<br> It's just for Mother, Brig. Didn't you hear?<br> All right.<br> You can hear it. It's not that secret, silly.<br> "That's all for tonight, except to say<br> "that come war, come<br> jungles, come Japanese,<br> "they're all so easy to take<br> "because at the end of this, my darling,<br> I know there waits for me your love."<br> There. Are you satisfied?<br> I think I'll go to my room, Mother.<br> I thought we were going to<br> try those new hairdos from Vogue.<br> Would you mind if we didn't?<br> There's a pamphlet I want<br> to study on third-degree burns.<br> All right, darling.<br> We can try them, Brig.<br> I think it's time something<br> was done about your hair anyway.<br> If you want to, Mother,<br> provided you'll let me...<br> Don't start making deals with me.<br> How old do you think I<br> could look if my hair was up?<br> Well, let's see.<br> I should say just about the same age.<br> But nicer, maybe. Why?<br> Mother, it's just terrible...<br> my not doing<br> anything about the war at all.<br> You've rolled bandages,<br> you've collected salvage,<br> and you've sold more war<br> stamps than any girl in your class...<br> not that that's any surprise to me.<br> - But that's all kid stuff.<br> - It's no such thing.<br> I know it's important, but...<br> Mother, I miss Pop something awful!<br> I know, honey.<br> So do I.<br> - Thanks, toots.<br> - Ice cream?<br> Ice cream again? Sure<br> wish I had some watermelon.<br> Now, you men watch Joe carefully.<br> All it is is learning how to walk again.<br> Thanks.<br> - Got any tutti-frutti?<br> - Sorry, we only have vanilla.<br> Gee, we never have no tutti-frutti.<br> Wake up, Miz Hilton. Wake up.<br> What is it?<br> It's almost time for dinner. Wake up.<br> Where's Mr. Hilton?<br> Mr. Hilton?<br> I guess I must have been dreaming.<br> You sure was sleeping hard.<br> - Aren't you home early?<br> - Yes, ma'am, a little.<br> I got a new union rule for myself...<br> - Is that for me?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> That's why I woke...<br> What's the matter, Miz Hilton?<br> What is it, child?<br> Jane, Brig, come quick!<br> ...I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br> And God bless Pop and Mother<br> and Jane and Fidelia<br> and Uncle Tony and Soda.<br> And please, God, make Pop safe.<br> I know he is safe. You<br> wouldn't let anything happen to him.<br> But please, make him safe anyway.<br> Amen.<br> Make Pop safe.<br> Are you awake?<br> Yes, Brig.<br> Do you mind if I get into bed with you?<br> No, I don't mind.<br> Don't let Mother hear you.<br> He'll come back to us.<br> He'll come back.<br> Wipe sorrow's tears away<br> Nor let me ever stray<br> From Your side<br> In these troublous times,<br> when many of our loved ones<br> are making the supreme sacrifice,<br> I've searched the Holy<br> Scriptures and my heart<br> for some message of<br> comfort and inspiration to you.<br> On other occasions<br> I've quoted from St. John<br> and the prophet Zechariah.<br> I've reminded you of the 23rd Psalm...<br> "Thy rod and Thy<br> staff, they comfort me."<br> Today I offer you the<br> words of a Maryland lawyer<br> of another day, when<br> Americans were fighting<br> to preserve their<br> sacred heritage of liberty.<br> "O thus be it ever<br> when free men shall stand<br> "between their loved<br> homes and the war's desolation.<br> "Blessed with victory and peace,<br> "may the<br> heaven-rescued land praise the power<br> "that hath made and<br> preserved this nation.<br> "Then conquer we must<br> "when our cause, it is just.<br> "And this be our motto...<br> In God is Our Trust."<br> Those words have become the<br> last stanza of our national anthem.<br> Bye.<br> - Jane, you know what?<br> - What?<br> Gladys' stepfather is 4F.<br> Jameson's a nice old duffer,<br> but I don't know why we have<br> to have all that flag-waving.<br> How's everything going with you, Emily?<br> Still having a good time, I hope.<br> You know me.<br> "Carry on," is my<br> motto, "come what may."<br> You're one woman<br> who can be depended upon<br> to maintain her standards in these times.<br> - Thank you, dear.<br> - Hello, Mary.<br> - I was so sorry to hear about...<br> - Thank you.<br> I've been meaning to call<br> you, Anne. Really, I have.<br> I just heard the other day about Tim.<br> - I'm terribly sorry.<br> - Thank you, Emily.<br> But you mustn't give<br> up hope. C'est la guerre.<br> By the way, that's a very<br> cute frock you're wearing.<br> I remember admiring it last year.<br> - No, the year before last.<br> - Really?<br> You never were much<br> interested in clothes.<br> Well, I must run along now.<br> - Good-bye, girls.<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Hawkins.<br> I don't like the way Jane's looking.<br> And, dear, if you run into<br> difficulties about your food,<br> I have a cold storage<br> pantry just filled with goodies.<br> We do beautifully on our points.<br> If everybody had my foresight,<br> there wouldn't be any shortages.<br> Good-bye, dear. Give me a ring sometime.<br> I am so sorry about<br> Tim, but he may turn up yet.<br> Yes, you never can tell. Good-bye, Emily.<br> What are we going to do this afternoon?<br> - Did I say anything to...<br> - Could we go to the movies?<br> How do you feel about it, Jane?<br> That child... can't<br> she do anything but hiss?<br> I'll go see what she wants.<br> There's a concert today in<br> the park, the last of the season.<br> Or does the idea of<br> listening to music bore you?<br> Well, the fact of the matter is...<br> Yeah, I think a concert<br> sounds good. Don't you, Jane?<br> Well, I don't know, Bill.<br> If you feel like some music.<br> Or would you, by some remote chance,<br> like to be alone with<br> each other this afternoon?<br> - No, Mrs. Hilton.<br> - No, Mother, honestly.<br> We thought it might be nice<br> if we went out to the country.<br> Would you mind if I went<br> to Gladys' for the afternoon?<br> Darling, you run along if you want to.<br> See if you can<br> teach her some semaphores.<br> - Bye, Bill.<br> - Bye, Brig.<br> You see, Mother, Bill's leaving tonight.<br> He's been transferred to...<br> what'd you call it? ...a staging area.<br> I didn't know. Do you know where?<br> - Well, yes, but...<br> - Of course you can't say.<br> - Or whether you're going to come back.<br> - It'll be the last stop, I suppose.<br> Isn't that awful, Mother?<br> - I'm sure it's what you want, Bill.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - If it weren't for...<br> - May I see Bill off, Mother?<br> You see, I don't have to go back to camp.<br> I'm catching the Pathfinder at midnight.<br> May I please, even if it is late?<br> Of course, provided I can, too.<br> - Would you? That's wonderful.<br> - Mother, you're so sweet.<br> - You almost knocked me over.<br> - Will you have supper with us?<br> No, thank you. I have<br> a million things to do.<br> I'll see you at the train. So long, kids.<br> Gee, she's nice.<br> - She's so lonely, Bill.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> - Having difficulties, Colonel?<br> - Hello, Mrs. Hilton.<br> Do you know where I<br> might get some shoe polish<br> that isn't made of old sausage?<br> I wish I could get some sausage<br> that isn't made of old shoe polish.<br> Speaking of sausage,<br> could I fix you a cold lunch?<br> That would be very<br> nice. Very nice indeed.<br> I had intended going<br> downtown, but I was a bit tired.<br> You mean you<br> haven't had any breakfast?<br> No. The fact of the matter is I<br> don't like breakfast on Sundays.<br> But why not? Oh, I see.<br> You mean that since you called<br> off your deal with us for breakfast...<br> You sit right down over<br> there. I'll have it ready in a jiffy.<br> This is kind of you.<br> I'd better clean up a bit.<br> - Why don't you do it right here?<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm very sorry I had that<br> little run-in with your daughter.<br> Jane? It was her fault, I'm afraid.<br> That may be, but there was no<br> excuse for my own boorishness.<br> Let's forget it, shall we?<br> - Salad and milk?<br> - Fine, fine, anything.<br> Mrs. Hilton, I would like<br> to say that I admire very much<br> the manner in which you've<br> taken the news about your husband.<br> I'm afraid that underneath, I'm<br> perhaps not quite so courageous.<br> Then it's all the more admirable.<br> Fortitude is easy when there's no feeling.<br> - Aren't you having something?<br> - I'm not hungry.<br> - Colonel, may I say something?<br> - Anything.<br> I think it's a pity about you and Bill.<br> He's a wonderful boy. I can tell you that.<br> He's so hungry for<br> affection. He's like a lonely puppy.<br> Time he got over his<br> puppyhood, I should say.<br> - Bill's going to be a splendid man.<br> - Perhaps, perhaps.<br> Blood may tell in the end.<br> He's leaving tonight.<br> Going into combat duty, I imagine.<br> Is that so?<br> Jane and he are<br> spending the day together.<br> He's taking the Pathfinder at midnight.<br> I have an engagement tonight.<br> That's too bad.<br> Your grandson's going off to war.<br> But I don't suppose<br> that's of any importance to you.<br> If you'll excuse me.<br> I don't want you to think that I'm<br> any more ruthless than is the case.<br> I do have an<br> engagement, an important one,<br> with a British Army mission<br> that's only here for the day.<br> Here's the wire from<br> them. There's nothing I can do.<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> I'm sorry for Bill and for you.<br> Perhaps I can finish<br> in time, in which case...<br> - You'll be at the station?<br> - I'll try. I'll try my best.<br> But if I can't, would you...<br> Would you wish the boy luck for me?<br> Of course I will. It'll<br> mean a great deal to him.<br> And thank you very much for the lunch.<br> Will you give us another<br> chance at breakfast? On the house.<br> Of course I will. Delighted, I'm sure.<br> Good afternoon, Colonel.<br> Wonderful woman. Wonderful woman!<br> Was a farmer, had a daughter<br> And her name was Clementine<br> Light she was and like a fairy<br> And her shoes were number nine<br> Oh, my darling, oh, my darling<br> Oh, my darling Clementine<br> You are lost and gone forever<br> Dreadful sorry, Clementine<br> I was thinking how much fun it<br> would be to stay out here always,<br> just like this.<br> Just the two of us.<br> Bill, if we only could.<br> I wonder how this thing works.<br> Something up there<br> on the tractor, I guess.<br> I think I'll try it.<br> This looks like a cinch! Sit<br> tight and I'll give you a ride!<br> Bill, be careful!<br> Bill, stop!<br> The farmer in the<br> dell, the farmer in the dell<br> The farmer in the<br> dell, the farmer in the dell<br> Hi-ho the merry-o<br> The farmer in the dell<br> Say, Jane, we'd better get out of here!<br> Where are you?<br> I'm right here, you darn fool.<br> Jane, I'm sorry. What happened?<br> We'd better get inside<br> someplace before it starts to rain.<br> Come on, Jane.<br> Oh, boy, we certainly made it just in time!<br> How will we get home if this keeps up?<br> Must be almost 7:00.<br> Well, what do you know? You guessed it!<br> It's just exactly 18 minutes to 7:00.<br> Only five hours more.<br> I almost forgot for a little while.<br> I didn't forget, not for a minute.<br> I've thought about it all day long.<br> Well, gee, I never thought<br> anybody would care about me...<br> anybody like you.<br> Jane, I don't want to leave you.<br> It won't be for long, darling.<br> It might be for<br> months, or for years, maybe.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I'll be thinking about you all the time.<br> Someday the war will<br> be over. Then we can be...<br> - Then we can be married, Jane?<br> - Do you want to be, Bill?<br> Oh, darling.<br> I'm so happy.<br> I just can't believe it. I just can't.<br> I love you. I do. I love you, I love you.<br> I just don't understand it.<br> Bill, do you realize we're engaged?<br> Engaged.<br> Aren't you going to kiss me?<br> There's just one thing I<br> want more than anything else.<br> And what's that?<br> I want you and Pop to<br> meet and know one another.<br> I hope he'll like me.<br> How could he help liking you?<br> Bill, you're so sweet, so good,<br> so handsome.<br> Handsome?<br> Why, I love your face. It's<br> the cutest face I've ever seen.<br> Cute? That's a fine thing to say to me.<br> And you're such a baby.<br> Look, the rain's stopped.<br> Isn't that too bad?<br> Yes. It's awful, but<br> we'd better get started back.<br> We've got to make that train.<br> Yeah, I guess you're right.<br> I hope you didn't<br> catch the flu in this storm.<br> Don't start worrying about<br> me or I'll break our engagement.<br> You have the prettiest hair.<br> I'll bet no other<br> nurse's aide has hair like that.<br> Lots of them have. Prettier, too.<br> - They don't have as pretty eyes.<br> - Prettier.<br> Noses, then.<br> - Lots prettier.<br> - I don't believe it.<br> I'll tell you one thing they don't have.<br> They don't have precious you<br> to take them out to the country.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Precious, cute...<br> New York Central train<br> number 2, the Pathfinder,<br> leaving at 12:01 for Buffalo, Rochester,<br> Syracuse, Utica, Albany, and New York<br> on track number 4.<br> Just let me look at you, darling.<br> It's a picture I'll carry with me always.<br> Now go, and don't even look back.<br> Look at the nice apple Daddy got you.<br> But I don't want you to go away.<br> So it is late. Let me<br> come up for ten minutes.<br> I'm sorry, Mom. I've only got five minutes.<br> My furlough was canceled.<br> I swear, I can't tell any<br> difference between it and butter.<br> - Hello. My mommy's a sergeant.<br> - No fooling!<br> I won't forget.<br> What's a good excuse for being AWOL?<br> Agnes, look, on that dame... nylons.<br> Now go, and don't even look back.<br> Five months' pay... give me<br> some War Bonds, and plenty of 'em.<br> What, Bill?<br> - Nothing. Just Jane.<br> - Silly.<br> It suits me if they tax me 100%.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> - I was just thinking.<br> - So was I.<br> I wonder if there's someplace free<br> where we don't have<br> to dance with hostesses.<br> In 15 minutes you'll be gone.<br> I know, I'll meet you in New York.<br> You will?<br> And we'll get married and I'll have a baby.<br> Boy, that sounds wonderful.<br> We'll get married and I'll have a baby.<br> We'll do it... the day the war is over.<br> No, I mean tomorrow. Or Tuesday.<br> Gee, Jane, we couldn't do that.<br> - Yes, we could, and we will.<br> - You could and you will what?<br> Now, don't tell me you<br> two are having an argument.<br> A fine thing, I must say...<br> ten minutes before train time.<br> It doesn't make any sense, Jane.<br> What doesn't make any sense?<br> All right, don't tell me, then.<br> Jane, would you get Bill some magazines?<br> - He doesn't need any.<br> - I don't need magazines.<br> Then some newspapers<br> or cigarettes... anything.<br> But, Mother, why?<br> Because I want to talk to Bill.<br> I'll be finished by the<br> time you get back, I promise.<br> I'm sorry to break in on<br> these last minutes, Bill.<br> I hope you're not worried<br> over what we were talking about.<br> - I told Jane...<br> - You don't have to tell me.<br> I wanted to talk to<br> you about your grandfather.<br> Oh, him.<br> The colonel was very<br> upset about your leaving.<br> How did he know I was<br> leaving? Did you tell him?<br> Yes. I hope you don't mind.<br> It doesn't make any<br> difference. Not to him, it doesn't.<br> Your grandfather loves you very deeply.<br> Then why wasn't he here to see me off?<br> I think he'll still make it.<br> He said he was going<br> to try, and I believe him.<br> He said if he didn't, to wish you luck.<br> He did?<br> Isn't there something<br> you want me to say to him?<br> Well, maybe you could tell him that...<br> tell him that I'm a Smollett, all right,<br> and before this thing is<br> over, I'll make him proud of me yet.<br> Gee, that's a grandstand speech for you.<br> No, it isn't. It's the very<br> nicest gift you could give him.<br> When you come back, we'll be<br> waiting for you... the whole family.<br> Thanks, Mrs. Hilton.<br> I hope Jane doesn't bring<br> me back any mystery magazines.<br> I can't follow them. Here she is.<br> Have you finished, Mother?<br> I tried to get mystery<br> magazines, but they're all sold out.<br> - You see how lucky you are?<br> - What do you mean?<br> Never mind. Good-bye, Bill.<br> Where are you going, Mother?<br> I'll wait at the soda<br> fountain. You two finish your argument.<br> We weren't arguing.<br> You were giving a good imitation of it.<br> - So long.<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Hilton.<br> I hope...<br> I know everything's going to<br> be all right about Mr. Hilton.<br> Gate number 2 now<br> open for the Pathfinder<br> leaving at 12:01 a.m.<br> You will marry me<br> when it's over, won't you?<br> You won't be mad<br> because I didn't marry you now?<br> Of course I won't be mad.<br> - But you take care of yourself.<br> - I will.<br> - You write to me.<br> - I will.<br> - You do understand, don't you?<br> - I think so.<br> You know it's because I<br> wouldn't want you to be...<br> Well, you know, if<br> anything happened to me...<br> - A widow, you mean.<br> - Yes, but not only that.<br> If something happened... I mean, if I was...<br> If you were wounded?<br> Bill, I'd take care of you<br> the rest of our lives, always.<br> Gee, we're being silly.<br> Maybe I'll be sent<br> to Bermuda or someplace.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Why, Jane?<br> Because you're<br> going to really show them.<br> And you know where<br> we'll go when we're married?<br> Right up to West Point. And<br> you'll show them your medals.<br> All aboard!<br> You better get on.<br> I almost forgot, I have something for you.<br> You have? You didn't have to do that.<br> - Here. It's my class ring.<br> - That's wonderful.<br> You're sure you don't need it?<br> I don't know what's more important<br> than its being our engagement ring.<br> Isn't it awful that I didn't get you a ring?<br> But I'll send you one.<br> It doesn't fit. I should<br> have gotten you something else.<br> No, I'd rather have this than anything.<br> Better get on, son.<br> We're about to pull out.<br> Hurry up, son.<br> Go ahead, Bill.<br> I almost forgot. Here.<br> Have your picture taken as soon<br> as you get there and send me one.<br> I will.<br> And don't you go getting fatter.<br> Don't worry, I won't. Jane, here! Hurry!<br> It's your watch! You'll need it!<br> Good-bye, darling.<br> Bill, I'll keep it. I'll<br> keep it with me all the time.<br> So long, darling.<br> Bye. Take care of yourself.<br> - Good-bye, Bill!<br> - Good-bye, darling.<br> Good-bye, darling! I love you!<br> - I love you, darling!<br> - Good-bye, darling.<br> Good-bye, darling.<br> Good-bye, darling.<br> - Has the Pathfinder left yet?<br> - Yes, sir, right on time.<br> Hello, Brig!<br> Hi, Jane. Wait for me.<br> I'll be there in a minute.<br> Now, Gladys, don't<br> forget to go to the Jacksons'<br> and pick up those big empty paint cans.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - How are things at the hospital?<br> - Fine.<br> - How's school?<br> - Same old bore.<br> Young girls should get an education.<br> Is that so? I didn't<br> notice you dashing off to college.<br> I'll go to college<br> eventually to please Mother.<br> We couldn't afford it now anyway.<br> Maybe Bill and I will go<br> together after we're married.<br> Fat chance.<br> Mrs. William Smollett II,<br> queen of the freshman hop.<br> Look at Soda. He's<br> got some new playmates.<br> Hello, Soda. Jane, what<br> have you heard from Bill?<br> He's fine. I think he<br> expects to see action any day now.<br> Wouldn't it be fun to go there on your<br> honeymoon and visit<br> the places he's fought?<br> I don't think so.<br> I wanna get a little place all by ourselves,<br> just as far away from all that as...<br> What about a houseboat on the Nile?<br> Or a cottage on the beach at Waikiki.<br> You could go surf-riding.<br> Jane, will you take me along?<br> Brig, how can you be so infantile?<br> All right, I'll be<br> getting married myself someday,<br> and you'll be looking<br> for an invitation from me.<br> Then you'll be sorry<br> you were so snooty about it.<br> Come on in, Soda, if you're coming.<br> - Hello, girls.<br> - Hello, Mother.<br> Would you mind checking the<br> oven? I've been making cookies.<br> - Mother, do I have to?<br> - Do as Mother asks, Brig.<br> All right.<br> Come into the living<br> room. I'd like to talk to you.<br> What's the matter?<br> - Mayn't I talk to you if I want?<br> - Of course.<br> But you sound so strange.<br> Do I? I'm sorry, I don't mean to.<br> What is it? Why couldn't Brig hear?<br> Is that why you sent her...<br> - Not about... Pop?<br> - No.<br> Sit down, darling.<br> Jane, dear, I'm terribly<br> proud of the way you've grown up.<br> I'm sorry Pop missed it.<br> Is that all? That's sweet of you, Mother.<br> No, dear, it isn't...<br> It's so wonderful being at the hospital.<br> I wish you could come and visit.<br> I will.<br> But some of it's so sad.<br> If you could see those boys.<br> And they're so cheerful, most of them.<br> I know. They have such courage.<br> I like to think that you have<br> that kind of courage, too, darling.<br> What are you trying to tell me?<br> That when a man goes<br> off to war, we have to be...<br> It's Bill!<br> The telegram came<br> just a few minutes ago.<br> It was addressed to you, but I opened it.<br> Did it say he was missing or what?<br> I don't care if he's wounded, if only...<br> No, dear, it said he...<br> It said he died in action at Salerno.<br> It couldn't be!<br> It couldn't be!<br> It could be a mistake, couldn't it, Mother?<br> I've heard that sometimes<br> they get the names mixed up.<br> No, honey, you mustn't fool yourself.<br> That would be the worst thing of all.<br> You've got to face it,<br> as hard and cruel as it is.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I've known it all along.<br> Cry, darling. Cry your heart out.<br> I won't try to tell you<br> that you'll get over it soon,<br> because it will take<br> time... maybe a long time.<br> No, I won't cry.<br> A wonderful boy loved you, Jane.<br> That doesn't happen to everybody.<br> But I had him only for such a little while.<br> I'll go help with supper.<br> There's chicken<br> fricassee just the way you like it.<br> Sounds fine.<br> Isn't it funny?<br> We were just talking.<br> Brig was just saying about our...<br> ...about our honeymoon.<br> Oh, my baby.<br> My poor, poor baby.<br> He struggled so hard to be a soldier<br> because I insisted on it.<br> I, in my infinite wisdom.<br> He would have been a<br> soldier anyway as things turned out.<br> Yes, but all he learned from me<br> was the glory, decorations, parades.<br> Bill had character and<br> courage. I know you gave him those.<br> I hope so.<br> - He loved you.<br> - Mrs. Hilton, I'm not a child.<br> He hated me. To whom<br> did that telegram come?<br> Why, he didn't even<br> list me as next of kin.<br> The telegram came to Jane<br> because they were to be married.<br> - I didn't know, of course.<br> - I should have told you before.<br> Colonel, if only you<br> could believe that he loved you.<br> Don't you remember the<br> message he sent to you...<br> that he was a Smollett, all right,<br> and before the war was<br> over, you'd be proud of him?<br> He did say that, didn't he?<br> Yes, I am proud of him.<br> My only grandchild had to die before l...<br> Come in.<br> Good evening, Colonel Smollett.<br> Good evening, Jane. Come in, please.<br> I thought perhaps I could<br> bring you a little supper.<br> Why, thank you. That's<br> most thoughtful of you.<br> I'm awfully sorry about...<br> Would you like to have this?<br> I think he'd rather you...<br> - I'm awfully glad we're friends.<br> - So am I.<br> I'll get your supper<br> now if you'll excuse me.<br> Colonel, won't you have supper with us?<br> I should love to.<br> - I'll come right down, dear.<br> - All right, Mother.<br> And I might have had that<br> wonderful child as a granddaughter.<br> Bill was fortunate to have known her.<br> Bill deserved her.<br> He was such a good boy.<br> Yes, I dare say.<br> The good die first.<br> And they whose hearts<br> are dry as summer dust<br> burn to the socket.<br> Shall we stop a moment and<br> rest in the shade, Mr. Williams?<br> I can't imagine anything<br> more pleasant than being out here.<br> Or do you miss the water?<br> I love to sail, so I<br> can understand it if you do.<br> I hate it. I never<br> want to see the ocean again.<br> Would it help you to talk about it?<br> I hate the ocean.<br> Of course you do. I understand.<br> It's almost time for your lunch.<br> Dr. Golden will be<br> angry with me if you're late.<br> He's taken a great interest in you.<br> Me in the Merchant Marine?<br> That was a joke in the first place.<br> I've always hated the<br> water, ever since I was a kid.<br> But most boys love the<br> water. They love to swim.<br> I couldn't swim.<br> Then one day my brother<br> Jimmy pushed me off the pier.<br> Then he had to pull me out.<br> He was always laughing at me<br> and telling me not to be yellow.<br> He told me not to be<br> yellow when our ship was hit.<br> That was the last time I ever saw him.<br> You're not a coward,<br> Danny. Fear is normal.<br> We'll help you to understand that.<br> And when you do, you<br> won't be afraid of the water.<br> You won't even be afraid of being afraid.<br> Rest a while, Danny. You're a fine boy.<br> I'm sorry to have<br> interrupted you, Dr. Golden,<br> but I was instructed<br> to get the patient to bed.<br> It's all right. He's had<br> quite enough for one day.<br> Doctor, will Mr. Williams be all right?<br> In time. In time.<br> He's a fine young man. He<br> must have another chance at life,<br> and we must work to give it to him.<br> His burns seem almost healed.<br> Yes, his burns, but<br> the most serious injury...<br> that, I am afraid, will take more time.<br> The injury to his<br> mind? Is that what you mean?<br> No, not to his mind.<br> To his confidence in<br> himself and in others.<br> Yes, we must rebuild Danny Williams' life<br> all the way back and all the way forward.<br> Hasn't there ever been<br> anyone close to you, Miss Hilton,<br> for whom you would<br> like to have done that?<br> Yes, there was someone.<br> There was.<br> We must not live in the past, my child.<br> There is a whole<br> wide broken world to mend.<br> Come, come, I<br> mustn't have another patient.<br> How would you like to<br> do a tired old man a favor?<br> - Anything, Doctor.<br> - Then smile for me.<br> Let me see that young<br> people still can smile<br> as they used to long ago.<br> Yes.<br> Just as I remember.<br> Good night, my child.<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday, dear Colonel<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Thank you, Mrs. Hilton.<br> Thank you, Jane. Thank you, Brig.<br> And thank you,<br> Fidelia, for the beautiful cake.<br> Better wait till you taste it.<br> It's kind of an experimentation.<br> Now you make a wish. And<br> if you want it to come true,<br> you have to blow out all<br> the candles with one breath.<br> Really? All of them?<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Don't you think we might<br> allow the colonel two breaths?<br> No special dispensations are necessary.<br> Now you have to get the first piece.<br> Really, Bridget, I wasn't born yesterday.<br> There are a few things that I do know.<br> Bridget, he's here again.<br> Soda, get down. Come here.<br> He never does that with anybody else.<br> He's apparently very devoted to you.<br> I have taken every conceivable<br> step to discourage his affection.<br> I wonder who that could be.<br> Is you anticipating callers, Miz Hilton?<br> I'll answer it, Fidelia.<br> Don't you bother. You're busy.<br> If it's Gladys, I'm not home.<br> Yes, the bad penny again.<br> - How are you, Janie?<br> - I'm fine, Tony.<br> Brig wrote me about... everything.<br> Please, don't talk about it.<br> I understand.<br> - Who is it, Jane?<br> - You'll never guess!<br> It's the colonel's<br> birthday. We're giving him a party.<br> Maybe I'd better go.<br> You'll do no such thing.<br> You're just what we need.<br> - Not Lieutenant Willett!<br> - Lieutenant Commander to you.<br> Not really? Congratulations.<br> You didn't say you were coming back.<br> I was going to write you,<br> but I wasn't sure you cared.<br> You're just in time<br> for some birthday cake.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Willett.<br> - How are you, sir?<br> So you've been promoted.<br> I suppose there must<br> have been some reason for it.<br> I'm sure I don't know<br> what it could have been.<br> I was sorry to hear about Bill.<br> Thank you.<br> Sit down, Tony.<br> That looks good. Where's Fidelia?<br> - Here I is, Lieutenant Willett.<br> - Fidelia. This makes it official.<br> - Here, give me that.<br> - Thank you.<br> I sure is glad to see you back.<br> Should I move the rooms<br> around like before, Miz Hilton?<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> Don't worry, I've got a<br> room downtown this time.<br> Never heard tell such a thing.<br> Now...<br> I almost forgot, I have<br> something for you, Jane.<br> Didn't you bring me anything?<br> It isn't anything, but I<br> couldn't resist getting it for Jane.<br> Where on earth did you get it?<br> It was practically the only<br> thing left of a little shop in Salerno.<br> I'm sorry, Jane. I didn't know where...<br> It's all right, Tony.<br> Well, isn't anybody<br> interested in this cake?<br> By the way, Fidelia, just<br> what was the experimentation<br> you referred to in<br> connection with this cake?<br> I tried something new. I bought it.<br> You clearly see there's<br> nothing in the handkerchief.<br> Nothing at all that meets the human eye.<br> I'll show you both sides so you can<br> be sure I'm not holding back anything.<br> Correct, Brig?<br> I suppose there's<br> something there, but I'll play along.<br> - How about you, sir?<br> - There's nothing in that handkerchief.<br> You don't need to labor the point further.<br> Tiresome, isn't it? Watch.<br> Presto, change-o.<br> - Marvelous!<br> - I'll get it.<br> I think I'd like to<br> learn that trick, Mr. Willett.<br> It might amuse the dodos<br> at the Army and Navy Club.<br> I'd be honored, sir.<br> Good evening, Brig.<br> Is your mother at home?<br> That sounds like your favorite woman.<br> Mrs. Hawkins... that voice has<br> haunted me across the Atlantic.<br> Hello, Emily. I haven't seen you in ages.<br> Good evening, Lieutenant<br> Willett. I didn't know you were back.<br> I've learned a new trick. The<br> Navy thought I ought to bring it home<br> for purposes of morale.<br> I thought you already knew<br> all the tricks, Lieutenant.<br> Touch, as we used<br> to say in Minneapolis.<br> And this, I presume, is General Smollett.<br> - I've heard so much about you.<br> - I thought you'd met before.<br> No, but I envy you, having such<br> a distinguished man as your guest.<br> It is I who should be envied.<br> And it is Colonel Smollett, madam,<br> and Lieutenant Commander Willett.<br> I always get those things mixed up.<br> It doesn't matter what a man's<br> rank is. It's his character that counts.<br> Hello, Jane. What's this I hear<br> about you working at the hospital?<br> - I'm a nurse's aide.<br> - A nurse's aide?<br> What a revolting idea for<br> an unmarried girl of your age.<br> Our whole code of living seems<br> to be completely ignored these days,<br> and possibly it's none of my business.<br> You're quite right, Mrs.<br> Hawkins. It is none of your business.<br> I must say, Lieutenant or<br> Commander or whatever you are,<br> the Navy hasn't<br> improved your manners any.<br> Please, Tony. Please, Emily.<br> It's the colonel's birthday,<br> and we're trying to have a party.<br> I'm sorry. I meant<br> no offense to you, Jane.<br> I simply feel that<br> well-brought-up young girls<br> shouldn't be permitted to have such<br> intimate contact with all sorts of...<br> All sorts of boys who've<br> lost their arms and legs?<br> They're young, too, lots of them.<br> But they weren't too<br> young for that, Mrs. Hawkins.<br> And I don't think<br> breeding entered into it, either.<br> Bravo, Jane.<br> I don't care to debate it with you, Jane.<br> But surely there are<br> women who are more suited...<br> There aren't women more suited.<br> And women who might help, like<br> you, think you're doing your part<br> if you attend a canteen<br> dance for your own pleasure.<br> You're tired, honey.<br> Why don't you go upstairs?<br> Yes, Mother.<br> There are just one or two<br> more things I want to say.<br> She's not worth it.<br> We're not V-Girls! We're<br> simply helping with the wreckage.<br> Brig, let's go play with our dolls.<br> Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins.<br> Please don't worry if<br> our precious well-bred hands<br> come in contact with<br> those mangled bodies.<br> We'll survive! Even when they don't!<br> What has happened that you<br> would permit a child of yours<br> to talk that way without so much as a...<br> Without so much as what?<br> Thank heaven my child<br> had the courage to say to you<br> what should have been said long ago.<br> And let me add that I'm ashamed<br> that I've put up with<br> you, that I've even known you.<br> Well!<br> From now on, you needn't know me.<br> Don't you think for a<br> minute you have me fooled.<br> I've not forgotten how you<br> felt about your husband joining up.<br> And may I ask just what<br> other noble sacrifices you've made<br> to give you the privilege<br> of being so self-righteous?<br> I'm afraid that's just it, Emily.<br> I haven't really made any sacrifices.<br> I haven't hoarded and cheated<br> and done the selfish,<br> unpatriotic things that you've done,<br> but as far as making sacrifices,<br> I'm afraid we're two of a kind.<br> And the realization of it<br> doesn't make me very proud or happy.<br> Well!<br> Good-bye, Major.<br> I think we've seen the<br> last of Mrs. H. For a while.<br> When I think of the good men<br> they waste on Kitchen Police.<br> I wish getting Emily out of the<br> house was a solution to something.<br> It's a temporary solution<br> to the problem of avoiding Emily Hawkins.<br> How about a little<br> nightcap for the three of us, Anne?<br> I'll run up and see how<br> Jane is, if you don't mind.<br> You'll find some scotch on the sideboard.<br> Please don't go,<br> Tony. I want to talk to you.<br> - Say when, Colonel.<br> - That'll be fine.<br> Happy birthday.<br> Thanks. I almost forgot.<br> - A pity, isn't it?<br> - It sure is.<br> Well, I think I'll take myself off to bed.<br> Good night, Willett.<br> I rather like you, if I may say so.<br> Couldn't be more pleased, sir.<br> - You'll ruin your big toe.<br> - Wouldn't that be awful?<br> I'd never be able to<br> place-kick again for old Rutgers.<br> You didn't expect to find<br> another front here at home, did you?<br> But our side won...<br> victory over gas power.<br> - How's Jane?<br> - She's fine.<br> Her thinking is as clear as a<br> bell. How am I, why don't you ask?<br> Trying to figure out<br> what sacrifices you can make?<br> Don't, Tony.<br> After all you've been through, to<br> have to listen to you berate yourself.<br> You wouldn't sit down and let<br> me talk for a minute, would you?<br> All right.<br> But I won't promise to listen.<br> What's your guess as<br> to why I joined the Navy?<br> 'Cause you want to do your<br> part, just the way Tim did.<br> Don't kid yourself. I'm no Tim.<br> I joined up because Top Hat<br> suddenly seemed a little silly<br> and I wanted to have<br> some fun and excitement.<br> I laughed up my sleeve at all the fellows<br> who were giving out with noble motives,<br> the Four Freedoms, and all the rest of it,<br> but I found out that it all added up<br> to a simple corny phrase<br> that I couldn't laugh off...<br> "Home sweet home."<br> - I know.<br> - You do know?<br> You're doing a swell job here<br> at home holding things together.<br> Those daughters of<br> yours, they're pretty wonderful.<br> I know Tim's going to be<br> mighty pleased with them.<br> I imagine he'll be a bit<br> surprised to see how Jane grew up<br> without so much as a by-your-leave.<br> Yes, she grew up while Mother knitted.<br> Or worse still, while<br> Mother didn't even knit.<br> That's the point, Tony. Can't you see it?<br> Boy, I see what you<br> mean now about not listening.<br> - I guess I was pretty dull.<br> - All right, laugh at me.<br> But it's settled in<br> my mind once and for all.<br> I have a husband who went off to<br> fight for this home and for me...<br> that's what you said.<br> And I have children who<br> had courage and intelligence<br> while their mother lived in a dream world.<br> I've come out of it.<br> I buy your "Home sweet home" idea,<br> but I want to do something about it.<br> Well, say something.<br> Don't tell me that glib Tony<br> Willett's at a loss for words.<br> Well, Annie, my girl,<br> I'm afraid you're right.<br> I hope you'll think I was right, too, Tim,<br> and that someday you'll be<br> interested in reading this diary.<br> And I hope you won't be<br> too shocked when you hear<br> that I'm actually<br> training for work in a shipyard.<br> Yes, tremendous<br> changes have taken place<br> in the pampered<br> woman who was your wife.<br> It's hard even for me to realize<br> I'm studying to be a lady welder.<br> And doing very nicely, so it seems.<br> Oh, Tim, I love it so,<br> and I have such<br> admiration for all these people.<br> There's one woman I<br> can't wait for you to meet.<br> Her name is nothing like we<br> ever heard at the country club.<br> It's Zofia Koslowska, and she likes me<br> because she thinks I helped her<br> through a most awful<br> and tragic Ioneliness.<br> I wish my little boy had<br> lived so he could have seen America.<br> I used to read to him about it every night<br> when the shades were drawn<br> and the sound of heavy<br> boots marching down the street<br> made my poor little Janka shake<br> until I thought his bones would crack.<br> And then we'd pray together<br> that God would let us go to<br> the fairyland across the sea.<br> If only he could have been<br> with me the day I went all by myself<br> to the Statue of Liberty<br> and read what it says<br> there for the whole world to see.<br> Do you know it?<br> Anne Hilton, did you ever read it?<br> No. I'm sorry to say, I don't know it.<br> I'll never forget it.<br> I know it so well here<br> because I feel it so much here.<br> It says...<br> "Give me your tired, your poor,<br> "your huddled masses<br> yearning to breathe free,<br> "the wretched refuse<br> of your teeming shore.<br> "Send these, the<br> homeless, tempest-tossed to me.<br> I lift my lamp beside the golden door."<br> You've helped light that<br> lamp for me, Anne Hilton.<br> And then, Tim, she said<br> the most thrilling thing<br> that has ever been said to me. She said...<br> You are what I thought America was...<br> what I meant when I<br> prayed with little Janka.<br> And as in my own small way<br> I help here in the shipyards,<br> I hope I may be worthy of her words,<br> just as each night I pray<br> that always I may be worthy<br> of those other thrilling words...<br> ... the first time and every time since<br> that you've said, "I love you."<br> Now remember, don't<br> start until the door opens.<br> And when it does, let 'em have it.<br> What's the matter? You look reluctant.<br> It ain't that I don't trust you,<br> but I'd like to have my money first.<br> You've got a very suspicious nature.<br> All set? Lieutenant<br> Solomon, clear for action.<br> Aye-aye, sir.<br> Jane, Colonel, come on.<br> Somebody's here. They're singing!<br> - I'll be down in a minute.<br> - Come on, Colonel!<br> "Silent night, peace on<br> earth, goodwill toward men."<br> I didn't want to wrap this<br> in a box with fancy ribbon,<br> but I knew you'd like to have it.<br> Thank you, Janie.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> - Who's next on your team?<br> - Colonel Smollett.<br> Get going, Colonel. You're our anchorman.<br> We've given you a nice easy one.<br> Please don't be patronizing. I can act it.<br> - All right, go.<br> - We've only got a minute and a half.<br> You might wait until I've read it.<br> - Have you read it? Time.<br> - Let's go, Colonel. Anchors aweigh.<br> - That is not it.<br> - Please, Colonel.<br> - Two words.<br> - It didn't say to talk.<br> What difference does it make if<br> I say "two" or hold up two fingers?<br> Come on, Colonel, it's<br> a half a minute already.<br> Is it an animal?<br> Come on, Danny<br> Williams, give him a question.<br> Is it a quotation?<br> Army mule.<br> They're being very stupid, Colonel.<br> You're giving a wonderful performance.<br> Do something else.<br> Rolling stone.<br> No talking, Colonel.<br> Colonel, don't get sore. Just<br> try doing what you did before.<br> If we don't guess it, we'll give up.<br> Anybody could guess that.<br> You can't guess, Fidelia. No fair.<br> We can afford to be<br> generous. Let them have Fidelia.<br> - Bottoms up.<br> - Thank goodness!<br> - Was that it?<br> - Certainly that was it.<br> I'm glad you weren't on<br> their team the whole time, Fidelia.<br> - How'd you guess it, Fidelia?<br> - It weren't nothin'.<br> I'm just naturally... psychopathic.<br> Come on, don't be nervous. Come on.<br> Mother, Gladys wants to say something.<br> Well, hallelujah! Bring her in!<br> This is Gladys Brown,<br> everybody. She's a friend of mine.<br> - Come in, Gladys.<br> - She wants to say something.<br> Come on, Gladys, it isn't hard. Honest.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Well, she made it anyway.<br> I have big plans for her next year.<br> Yes, she could be the class orator.<br> Come on, everybody,<br> coffee and sandwiches.<br> Congratulations, sir. I<br> thought you acted very good.<br> It was nothing really.<br> Gee, that was fun. The<br> colonel's a good sport.<br> Yes, we all adore him.<br> Fidelia, when did you start<br> specializing in this bird food?<br> You won't tell anybody?<br> There's a chicken leg I saved for you.<br> - That's more like it.<br> - Sneak out by yourself.<br> You'll find it on the<br> second shelf in the icebox.<br> It's a wonderful party.<br> It's Tony. He brings life to any party.<br> Tony's doomed to go through<br> life as everybody's darling.<br> Even to his men?<br> Well, they don't think<br> of him as darling, exactly.<br> Hero worship's more like it.<br> I'll bet he didn't tell you he's<br> been recommended for the Navy Cross.<br> No, really?<br> He'll make jokes about<br> it, but he's very proud of it.<br> I want to talk to you, John Paul Jones.<br> What have I done now?<br> The Navy Cross...<br> that's what you've done.<br> Yes, he told me. Do<br> they give you a ribbon?<br> What does it look<br> like? What are the colors?<br> - It looks just like that.<br> - Stop it, Tony.<br> This is an old one. It's last year's model.<br> He'll joke about it, but<br> he's really very proud of it.<br> Well, he said the same thing about you.<br> - If you people will excuse me now.<br> - He did, did he?<br> Never mind about him.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> I wish Solomon would<br> stop acting as my press agent.<br> - What do I do with this?<br> - What do you suppose?<br> - Finish it, you wastrel.<br> - I could use milk with it.<br> Honestly. I never knew<br> heroes were so helpless.<br> Here, look out.<br> Tony, I'm really very angry with you.<br> I have to find things out from a stranger.<br> Didn't think you'd be interested.<br> Of course not. No, all I want to know<br> is if you found any new sugars in Sicily.<br> I don't want to shock you,<br> but it's no wonder<br> those Italians can paint.<br> There was a dame standing<br> in the middle of the street<br> with a big tub of<br> spaghetti, and she had... she had...<br> Never mind what she had.<br> I have a little imagination.<br> Yeah. Well, even as I looked at her,<br> I thought, "She's good,<br> but what are all the women in<br> the world compared with Anne?"<br> Tony, will you never stop?<br> I'll never stop, Anne, as<br> long as I can dream about you.<br> If you ever thought that dream<br> had a chance of coming true, you'd...<br> I'd what, Anne?<br> Finish it yourself.<br> You make it pretty tough for me.<br> I'd feel I'd been<br> wrong about you all my life.<br> I'd have to go looking for a new ideal.<br> It's a little late for that.<br> What's more, you'd run for your life.<br> But first you'd wring my<br> neck as I'd expect you to.<br> That's right, and what<br> would be the fun in that?<br> I'd never be able to<br> break my heart over you anymore.<br> Tony, never grow up. Never, never.<br> Or I'd lose something very dear to me.<br> Something very dear to all of us.<br> All right, but I'm going<br> to sound awful silly someday<br> making verbal passes at you<br> when we're both in wheelchairs.<br> I'm looking forward to that.<br> Now wipe the milk off your silly face<br> and tell me in your usual<br> accurate fashion how you became a hero.<br> Well, I'll tell you.<br> I suddenly thought it<br> was kind of damp on deck.<br> I looked down and seemed to<br> be standing in a swimming pool...<br> - Well, good-bye, Jane.<br> - Good-bye?<br> I've signed on again and<br> I'll be shipping any day now.<br> - You must be glad.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> Jane, you've been<br> wonderful to me. May I write to you?<br> I wish you would.<br> Okay! You started it!<br> Merry Christmas!<br> I still contend that if there had been<br> one lone, single, solitary grain<br> of intelligence on our entire team...<br> - Colonel, stop right where you are.<br> - What's the matter?<br> And stop blushing. It's an old custom.<br> As I recall the custom, Mrs. Hilton,<br> the ceremony isn't complete<br> until everyone has participated.<br> Thank you, Anne.<br> I haven't had an<br> experience like this in 45 years.<br> Well, Merry Christmas to you all.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas, Colonel.<br> Come on, Soda.<br> Coming up, Mother?<br> Not for a little while.<br> I have a few things to do.<br> Good night.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> - Good night, Mother.<br> - Merry Christmas, Mother.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> Merry Christmas, darlings.<br> What are those, Fidelia?<br> Mr. Hilton done sent<br> these to me a long time ago<br> and told me to put them<br> under the Christmas tree<br> just like we've always done.<br> Now, now, no tears, Fidelia.<br> There's nothing to cry about.<br> I can't help it. He sent me something, too.<br> Mr. Hilton never forgot me, even<br> when he was fighting them devils.<br> He'll be so happy to hear that<br> you're back on the old job again.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Miz Hilton, can I confide something?<br> Yes, Fidelia.<br> Brig sent her daddy his<br> gift just like nothing happened.<br> Of course she did. So did Jane.<br> So did I.<br> You all did that?<br> Miz Hilton, I guess I just<br> ain't on the right side of the Lord.<br> I just ain't had the right kind of faith.<br> But I will have. From now<br> on, I'll be a true believer.<br> And now I'm wishing you<br> a good night, Miz Hilton.<br> Good night, Fidelia.<br> Hello?<br> Cable gram?<br> Yes, read it, please.<br> What was that? No. Yes, yes.<br> Yes, mail it to me, please. Yes, ma'am.<br> It's a cable! Pop's safe!<br> Pop's safe! I just<br> got word he's coming home!<br> He's coming home!<br>
