That's a break for us.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> I had several other calls<br> tonight to sit,<br> but I turned them all down 'cause I just<br> hoped and prayed that you would call.<br> Gosh, you look so sharp<br> in your tux.<br> Gosh!<br> [ Clears throat ]<br> I just did a new paint job on my nails.<br> Like them, Mr. King?<br> Yes. Fine.<br> I'm using a new perfume too.<br> It's called nuit d'amour.<br> That's French.<br> Oh.<br> It means "night of love. "<br> Like it?<br> Yes. It's keen.<br> Well, good night, Ginger.<br> The children are all sound asleep.<br> But if you need me, I left the<br> hammonds' phone number there on the desk.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Here it is, Ginger.<br> Oh, thank you,<br> Mr. King.<br> Have a nice time.<br> Yes, Ginger, we will.<br> You don't mind if I make a<br> few phone calls, do you?<br> A person gets so bored<br> just sitting.<br> All right, Ginger, but please don't<br> stay on the phone all the time.<br> And remember that the<br> children are asleep.<br> I will.<br> - Good night, Ginger.<br> - Good night.<br> She's so cute.<br> Are you quite sure you wouldn't like<br> to stay home and sit with her, dear?<br> Well!<br> What brought that on?<br> It's that perfume of Ginger's.<br> It brings out the beast in me.<br> Oh, stop it!<br> [ Both laughing ]<br> [ Muttering ]<br> Five and six, 11, carry one, and eight...<br> if we'd had a little more gin<br> this evening and less rummy...<br> yes. It wouldn't have been<br> quite so gruesome.<br> Why, Edna, how you talk!<br> We ought to be honored that<br> the hammonds invited us over.<br> Pipe down, will you.<br> You two broke even, but<br> the hammonds lost $5.20 to us. Ha!<br> Lost? Look here, pal,<br> the hammonds had better win.<br> That is, if you expect<br> to get that raise.<br> [ Silverware clinking ]<br> And so I said to the woman,<br> you couldn't possibly find<br> a better lawyer than Mr. Hammond.<br> Well, Harry, figure the score?<br> What's the bad news?<br> Good news, sir.<br> You and Mrs. Hammond are<br> the only winners... $5.20.<br> Aha! You see?<br> Concentration and memory.<br> Qualities which you two young fellas<br> would do well to acquire. Yes, sir.<br> You won $1.20 from us...<br> And $4.00 from the Philbys.<br> [ Mr. Hammond ] Good! Good!<br> I should say it is.<br> We never win.<br> [ Doorbell rings ]<br> Why, who on earth<br> could that be at this hour?<br> I-I'll go, dear. You take cream<br> and sugar, don't you, Tacey?<br> No, black, please.<br> How do you do, Horatio? Why,<br> hello, Clarence. Come in. Come in.<br> I'm afraid this is rather<br> late for a social call,<br> but I found a letter in my mailbox<br> intended for you, Horatio,<br> and as I happened<br> to be passing, I thought...<br> - good evening, Martha.<br> - Hello, Clarence.<br> - [ Bill ] Good evening.<br> - How do you do?<br> Ah, here we are.<br> I cannot think how the mailman<br> could have been so careless.<br> Oh, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid<br> I opened it before I realized.<br> Of course I didn't read it.<br> Thank you, Clarence.<br> [ Mrs. Hammond ] Anything important,<br> dear? No, no. Just a circular.<br> Won't you join us in a cup<br> of a coffee and a sandwich?<br> Oh, do.<br> There's more than aplenty.<br> I really should be getting back to mother,<br> but perhaps I could stay for a snack.<br> Of course you can.<br> She'll be all right.<br> You take sugar, don't you, Clarence?<br> Three lumps, please.<br> How are all the little irises<br> coming along, Mr. Appleton?<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> I must confess, I'm quite surprised to<br> find you and your wife here, Mr. King.<br> - Why?<br> - I just strolled past your house.<br> I felt sure you would<br> be at your own party.<br> Party?<br> [ Harry ] Not at our house.<br> Oh, yes, indeed.<br> The house was blazing with lights.<br> I could hear the music<br> halfway down the block.<br> As I went by,<br> I saw your guests dancing.<br> You and your Ginger.<br> [ Record player:<br> Swing ]<br> [ Continues ]<br> Oh. Hello.<br> We, uh... we didn't think<br> you'd be back so soon.<br> So it appears.<br> [ Boy ] Hi, pop.<br> We've been watching 'em dance!<br> You kids run upstairs to bed.<br> Go ahead.<br> Hurry up.<br> The idea, letting the baby out of bed<br> at this hour. Are you out of your mind?<br> Gosh, Mrs. King, I hope you're not sore<br> just because I invited a few friends.<br> [ Stops ] A person'd go<br> absolutely mad with nothing to do but sit.<br> If I were your mother,<br> heaven forbid,<br> I'd make it extremely painful for<br> you tossit for the next few days.<br> I think you'd better<br> have your friends...<br> gosh, Mr. King,<br> I feel so sorry for you.<br> She has a terrible<br> disposition, hasn't she?<br> [ Whistling ]<br> Oh.<br> [ Continues whistling ]<br> Well? Oh! [ Chuckles ]<br> What do you want?<br> Good morning, Mr. Taylor.<br> I was just admiring your bed of black<br> Iris. You keep away from my Iris.<br> I haven't forgotten yet what you said about<br> me and that girl from the florist shop.<br> I merely said... just "merely"<br> keep your mouth shut!<br> Well! Huh!<br> [ Exhales ]<br> Oh, good morning, Mr. Mcpherson. Mmm.<br> Must have been quite<br> a party you had last night.<br> Would you like a list of the guests who<br> got cockeyed, or have you already got it?<br> There's no need<br> to be unpleasant.<br> I merely made a friendly observation.<br> Well, make it someplace else.<br> [ Whistling continues ]<br> Henry! Henry! [ Barking ]<br> Why are you tickling that flower?<br> Yeah, why?<br> I am not tickling it, little boy.<br> I am gathering...<br> [ clears throat ] Just run along.<br> I have your mother's permission.<br> We won't bother you.<br> Tell us what you're doing.<br> Have you boys ever watched a Bumblebee<br> flitting from flower to flower?<br> Sure. Well, I am doing just<br> what the Bumblebee does.<br> Gosh!<br> Can you sting too?<br> Run away and play.<br> Find it?<br> It isn't upstairs.<br> Oh, what did I do<br> with that thing?<br> Oh, there it is.<br> [ Harry ]<br> What the devil is he doing?<br> Seems we have<br> a very healthy male Iris,<br> and he asked if he could have some<br> pollen so he could breed it to one of his.<br> We oughta charge him a stud fee.<br> Good-bye, honey.<br> Oh, uh, good morning, John.<br> Good morning.<br> I'm going in. I'll save<br> you a trip. Well, okay.<br> [ Harry ]<br> Anything interesting, Mr. Appleton?<br> Oh, good morning,<br> Mr. and Mrs. King.<br> The mailman asked me to hand<br> these to you. Thank you.<br> Did you, uh, get all<br> the pollen you needed?<br> Why, yes!<br> I believe it may produce<br> a fascinating hybrid.<br> Glad to hear it.<br> Well, good-bye, Mr. King.<br> don't forget, we're entitled to the<br> pick of the litter. [ Chuckling ]<br> Harry!<br> Come here, quick!<br> I got an answer!<br> Answer to what?<br> My ad!<br> Huh?<br> I didn't want to tell you,<br> but after that Ginger episode...<br> I put an ad in the Saturday review,<br> and I've got a wonderful answer.<br> Ad for what? A babysitter,<br> darling. A resident babysitter.<br> Oh, you're crazy. I knew you'd say<br> that. That's why I didn't tell you.<br> Listen to what I put in:<br> "Somewhere there must be<br> a struggling young person...<br> "Who would welcome a delightful<br> room, private bath, full board...<br> "In exchange for sitting with three<br> adorable children evenings...<br> "And some light housework.<br> Congenial, cultured atmosphere.<br> Write fully: Box 2301."<br> Aren't you stretching things a<br> bit, calling our three "adorable"?<br> Well, anyway, it seems to have<br> snared her. This is her answer.<br> "Dear sir or madam, if not too late, I wish<br> to apply for the position you advertised.<br> "I am engaged in a form of work which<br> makes me indifferent to my surroundings,<br> "providing I have a place<br> in which I can find solitude.<br> "I have studied psychology and am perfectly<br> competent to handle children of all ages...<br> "With efficiency and dispatch.<br> Yours sincerely,<br> Lynn Belvedere. "<br> don't you think<br> she sounds marvelous?<br> Well, she writes a short, businesslike<br> letter, yes, but what do we know about her?<br> Well, anyway,<br> I'm going to follow this up.<br> Okay, go ahead.<br> What can you lose?<br> See you tonight.<br> Bye, honey.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> That looks good.<br> Quit that.<br> Did you get it out?<br> Sure.<br> It hardly shows now.<br> If you kids let that dog in this<br> house again, I'll wallop both of you.<br> Okay, okay.<br> Tacey?<br> Hey!<br> Where is everybody?<br> [ Tacey ] We're up in the<br> maid's room! Come on up!<br> I can't. There's a chair in<br> the way. I know. It's stuck.<br> don't be so helpless.<br> Climb over it.<br> Tony, would you<br> leave that alone!<br> Look, boys, will you go downstairs<br> and bring up that thing I told you.<br> Okay.<br> Hi!<br> Hello.<br> Hello, darling.<br> Hi.<br> Did you have a nice earthquake? Oh,<br> we've been as busy as little beavers.<br> Isn't it wonderful? She's coming! Who?<br> Miss Belvedere.<br> Huh?<br> The babysitter who wrote this morning. Oh.<br> I decided not to waste<br> another moment,<br> so I sent her a long, straight<br> wire giving her all the dope...<br> And she wired back, and I wired<br> again, and this is what I got:<br> "Conditions acceptable. Arriving 9:35<br> tonight, union depot. Lynn Belvedere. "<br> [ Larry ] Hey, mom, pop! Give us a hand!<br> Come on.<br> Make yourself useful.<br> Hurry up! This thing's<br> heavy! [ Tony ] Mine too!<br> All right, boys, put them down<br> until daddy moves the chair.<br> You mind telling daddy where<br> his favorite chair is going?<br> Well, darling, she does have to<br> have something comfortable to sit on.<br> And you're taking Nero up so she'll<br> have an intellectual to talk to.<br> Right.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> In my ad I said that ours was<br> a cultured, educated background.<br> It won't do the girl any harm to find<br> out that at least isused to be a sculptor.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Besides, that'll take the curse off my<br> being a low, uncouth, struggling attorney.<br> Mm-hmm. But you aren't struggling<br> very intelligently right now.<br> It won't work, darling.<br> I tried it for hours.<br> Stop giving orders and push.<br> I'll get this thing out of here.<br> You kids get back<br> out of the way.<br> Now, one great big push.<br> [ Loud grunt ]<br> [ Tacey, boys laughing ]<br> Hey!<br> Do something, will ya!<br> I can't imagine<br> what's keeping them.<br> Maybe the train was late.<br> They usually are.<br> Would you pick those<br> cushions up for me?<br> I told those kids to stay out<br> of there. [ Phone ringing ]<br> Hello?<br> Oh, bill, it's you.<br> Yes, she's here.<br> Edna, it's bill.<br> Oh?<br> Hello, sweetie.<br> No.<br> No sign of them yet.<br> We're beginning to suspect that Harry took<br> her to a bar to get her plastered first.<br> Well, don't stay over there too late. I<br> have to get an early start in the morning.<br> Yes, I'll be home the minute she<br> arrives with a blow-by-blow description.<br> Good-bye.<br> [ Doorbell buzzes ]<br> Maybe that's them.<br> But it can't be.<br> Harry's got his key.<br> Yes? Mrs. King?<br> Mrs. Harry King?<br> Yes.<br> Uh, good evening.<br> I am Lynn Belvedere.<br> You're who?<br> Lynn Belvedere.<br> But...<br> but you can't be.<br> Why not? Have you ever<br> seen me before? No.<br> No, of course I haven't.<br> Very well then.<br> How do you do?<br> Edna, this man claims<br> that he's Lynn Belvedere.<br> [ Laughing ] I know. Edna, please.<br> I'm sorry.<br> This is my friend, Mrs. Philby.<br> Oh, she doesn't live here.<br> Delighted.<br> This is quite a shock.<br> You see...<br> well, we weren't<br> expecting a...<br> [ chuckles ] Well, I naturally<br> thought you were a woman.<br> You know.<br> Your advertisement, of which I have a<br> copy here, made no mention of sex.<br> Possibly not, but it<br> was obviously implied.<br> I advertised for someone to help with<br> the housework and sit with my children.<br> Mrs. King, I happen to dislike<br> all children intensely.<br> But I assure you that<br> I can readily attend...<br> To their necessary,<br> though unpleasant wants.<br> Sorry. I've just had a long and<br> very trying journey in a day coach.<br> May I see my room?<br> Well, I...<br> look here, Mr. Belvedere, you're<br> obviously here under false pretenses.<br> To the contrary.<br> If some young female arrived<br> calling herself Lynn Belvedere,<br> she would be here<br> under false pretenses.<br> May I please see my room?<br> But... but my husband<br> isn't home yet.<br> That, if I may say so, is a matter<br> of complete indifference to me.<br> I take it you are not retaining<br> my services to sit with him.<br> Now, may I see my room?<br> Why... well...<br> I-I guess so.<br> Um, I-it's upstairs.<br> Good evening.<br> Boys, what are you doing up?<br> Go back to sleep.<br> Is he a babysitter?<br> Gee whiz!<br> Never mind now.<br> Go to bed.<br> Oh, uh, these are my sons,<br> Larry and Tony.<br> And the baby's asleep.<br> Mom, why is it a man?<br> Shh-shh-shh.<br> Uh, you see, Mr. Belvedere, they also<br> thought that you were going to be a...<br> well, anyway, they seem to<br> be quite fascinated by you.<br> The fascination, I assure<br> you, is not mutual.<br> Which way, please?<br> Oh.<br> [ Whispers ]<br> Go to bed.<br> Gee whiz!<br> We, uh, tried to fix it<br> up as nicely as we could.<br> I hope you like it.<br> After the obvious<br> eliminations have been made,<br> I believe it will be<br> entirely satisfactory.<br> For my work I require an<br> atmosphere of spartan simplicity.<br> And may I ask<br> what your profession is?<br> Certainly.<br> I am a genius.<br> Satisfactory?<br> Eminently,<br> as far as I can judge.<br> At the moment.<br> With this exception.<br> I'll change it.<br> [ Door closes ]<br> [ Laughing ]<br> Oh, brother!<br> What am I going to do?<br> [ Door lock clicks ] Oh! It's Harry!<br> Oh, hello, dear.<br> You back?<br> Back? You and your<br> cockeyed classified ad.<br> She never even showed up.<br> I hung around the station till the<br> Porter practically threw me out.<br> Darling, I've got<br> something to tell you.<br> Uh...<br> [ Laughing ]<br> While you were gone...<br> what's so funny?<br> Go on!<br> Tell him!<br> Well...<br> I'm afraid to! He'll<br> kill me! Oh, shut up!<br> Mrs. King.<br> Before I retire for the night, may I<br> inquire what time you serve breakfast?<br> Um... uh...<br> about 7:30, usually.<br> Thank you.<br> Perhaps I should tell you<br> I'm a vegetarian.<br> I like fruit juice, coffee...<br> And thinly sliced<br> gluten bread, toasted.<br> I'll, uh, try to remember.<br> Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Who in the heck was that?<br> That, darling,<br> is Lynn Belvedere.<br> Huh?<br> [ Tacey, Edna laughing ]<br> [ Laughing, babbling ]<br> Now, Larry, that's enough sugar.<br> Aw, mom!<br> Do you want to get<br> another toothache?<br> Harry, will you please put down<br> that paper and talk to me?<br> Well, what's the... what are we<br> going to do about Mr. Belvedere?<br> Very simple.<br> As soon as he deigns to join us for<br> breakfast, I'm going to kick him out...<br> Right on his ear.<br> I guess you're right. But you'll<br> have to tell him. He scares me.<br> I think he's kinda cute.<br> Me too.<br> Well, I don't!<br> And genius or no genius, I'm going up and<br> tell him to get down here to breakfast.<br> I'll go with you. You boys sit<br> down and finish your breakfast.<br> [ Roddy laughing ]<br> Roddy!<br> For crying out loud!<br> Well, he's got a nerve!<br> Well, what's the difference?<br> He's going anyway.<br> There's not a sound.<br> He's probably still asleep.<br> Mr. Belvedere!<br> Maybe he's gone.<br> I hope so.<br> Ah.<br> Good morning.<br> Oh, uh, we're sorry to dash in on<br> you like this, but we did knock.<br> I don't doubt it,<br> Mrs. King.<br> When I practice my yoga, I'm completely out<br> of this world. I neither see nor hear a thing.<br> I take it breakfast is ready?<br> Yes, and the sooner<br> you come down, the sooner...<br> I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. King.<br> Now, look here, you,<br> I'm not...<br> it's no use, dear. He's out<br> of this world. He told you.<br> Oh, that's so sil...<br> I never heard of such a thing.<br> [ Babbling ]<br> don't do that, little boy.<br> Leave Mr. Belvedere alone,<br> darling.<br> Uh, you should be flattered.<br> He hates strangers as a rule.<br> [ Coos ]<br> Now, look here,<br> Mr. Belvedere.<br> A joke is a joke,<br> but this can't go on.<br> And why not,<br> Mr. King?<br> I'm perfectly willing to carry<br> out my end of our agreement.<br> I see no reason why you<br> should default on yours.<br> But it's obviously impossible.<br> You couldn't do<br> the things we require.<br> For instance,<br> could you bathe Roddy?<br> For many years, I have successfully<br> bathed individuals of all ages and sexes,<br> and I've never had<br> any complaints.<br> [ Babbling ]<br> don't do that again.<br> That's enough, Roddy.<br> Now, stop it.<br> My wife tells me that, uh,<br> you're a genius.<br> That is correct.<br> Well, if I'm not<br> too inquisitive,<br> do you mind telling me<br> what form it takes?<br> I am, in my way, a philosopher.<br> Oh, I see.<br> You just sit and think.<br> Mr. King, if more people<br> just sat and thought,<br> the world might not be in the<br> stinking mess that it is.<br> Well, maybe you've<br> got something there.<br> But, Mr. Belvedere, can you<br> really handle children?<br> [ Babbles ]<br> Mrs. King, as I told you last night,<br> I dislike children intensely,<br> and yours, if I may say so,<br> have peculiarly repulsive<br> habits and manners.<br> However, I assure you I can<br> cope with them successfully,<br> if given a free hand.<br> [ Sneezes ]<br> Gesundheit.<br> [ Clears throat ]<br> I better get down to the office.<br> So long, kids. I'll see<br> you tonight. Bye, pop.<br> Bye. Walk out to the<br> car with me, will you?<br> Uh, excuse me.<br> Certainly.<br> You will remain seated.<br> Now eat your breakfast, and<br> chew each mouthful 28 times.<br> Not 20, mind you, or 26,<br> but 28 times.<br> [ Squealing, giggling ]<br> Well, I don't know.<br> What do you think?<br> Should we give the guy<br> a whirl for a day or two?<br> We can try. At least the<br> children seem to like him.<br> [ Roddy screams, crying ]<br> What's the matter? What<br> happened? Why, Roddy!<br> Mrs. King, throughout this grisly meal,<br> your son has been pelting me with cereal.<br> I've taught him<br> an object lesson,<br> and, as you will observe,<br> he doesn't like it.<br> I guarantee he will never throw cereal<br> at me or anyone else again ever.<br> [ Roddy crying ]<br> Mr. Belvedere,<br> consider yourself hired.<br> He's done that to me too.<br> You've got something.<br> I couldn't agree<br> with you more, Mr. King.<br> You might even say<br> I have everything.<br> [ Tony ]<br> Look, Larry. I'm up.<br> Hi!<br> What goes with you two?<br> Mr. Belvedere taught us.<br> It's "yogi. "<br> Feels swell.<br> He says it relaxes you.<br> [ Chuckles ] Just be careful you don't<br> relax so much you break your necks.<br> We won't.<br> [ Sniffs, sighs ]<br> [ Humming ]<br> Hi, baby.<br> Everything under control?<br> Hello, darling!<br> Oh, Harry, he's wonderful! Terrific!<br> He must be. He's already got<br> the kids standing on their heads.<br> They love him. They've been as<br> good as gold all day. No kidding?<br> They ate their lunch<br> without a single argument.<br> He gave Roddy a bath, and there<br> wasn't a peep out of him.<br> And look! The icebox... he's fixed it.<br> It's been on the blink for days.<br> Well, I'll be...<br> [ Creaking ]<br> What's the matter with Henry?<br> Is he sick? No, darling.<br> It seems that Mr. Belvedere used<br> to be a dog trainer or something.<br> He had a long talk with Henry this morning,<br> and ever since Henry has been quiet as a mouse.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> Sounds like a treasure.<br> Oh, he is!<br> And in addition<br> to everything else,<br> he makes the most divine<br> combination salad you ever tasted.<br> Looks delicious.<br> There's just one thing...<br> he's sort of mysterious.<br> How do you mean?<br> [ Whispering ] Well, three times<br> today, when he finished his chores,<br> he went upstairs and locked<br> himself in his room.<br> I heard the lock click. I went up and<br> listened, but I couldn't hear a sound.<br> What do you suppose<br> he does up there?<br> [ Whispering ] Maybe he stands on his<br> head. That doesn't make much noise.<br> Oh!<br> Is he up there now?<br> No. He's out<br> taking his constitutional.<br> [ Aloud ]<br> Then why are we whispering?<br> [ Laughing ]<br> Oh, I forgot.<br> He says he goes out for a constitutional<br> every night before dinner.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> I gave him a key to his room, but he<br> doesn't know that I've got an extra one.<br> Would it be very unethical<br> if... it most certainly would.<br> Let's go.<br> It turns all right,<br> but nothing happens.<br> Here, clumsy.<br> Let me do it.<br> You sure that's the right key?<br> Yes, of course it is.<br> That's funny.<br> It doesn't work.<br> You're wasting your time,<br> Mrs. King.<br> Hello.<br> Good evening.<br> Knowing human nature as I do,<br> I suspected that you<br> might try to snoop.<br> This is a new lock.<br> But it can't be. I didn't order<br> a locksmith. It wasn't necessary.<br> I am an expert locksmith.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> I don't know, darling.<br> He may be all right, but let's<br> face it... he is a screwball.<br> Oh, Harry,<br> how can you say that?<br> He may be a little eccentric,<br> but... excuse me, father.<br> It's time we washed our<br> face and hands for dinner.<br> Mr. Belvedere says cleanliness<br> is next to godliness.<br> We won't be long.<br> Need I say more?<br> Nope. I'm sold.<br> [ Both chuckling ]<br> I'll say good night to Roddy.<br> You know, Mrs. King, it's<br> really all your fault. Hmm?<br> If you weren't so darned pretty,<br> we wouldn't have so many<br> kids for people to sit with.<br> [ Bell tolling ]<br> Uh, good morning, Belvedere.<br> You will kindly address me<br> as Mr. Belvedere...<br> Until I Grant you permission<br> to drop the title,<br> a contingency which seems<br> hardly likely, Mr. Appleton.<br> Oh, well, really, I...<br> I intended no offense.<br> Uh, tell me, Mr. Belvedere, are you<br> completely happy with the Harry Kings?<br> Only an idiot is<br> completely happy anywhere.<br> I understand those dear little<br> boys are devoted to you...<br> And that Mrs. King considers<br> you quite a treasure.<br> Indeed? Yes, indeed. And she should.<br> As my mother is always saying, good<br> servants are worth their weight in gold.<br> The next time your parent<br> makes that original observation,<br> tell her it's one of<br> the older clichs.<br> Yes, I will. Incidentally, my mother is very<br> anxious to make your acquaintance properly.<br> Perhaps you could drop in for a<br> visit on your next afternoon off.<br> I am not a servant, Mr. Appleton.<br> My afternoons are always my own.<br> Well, in that case, drop in<br> anytime for a glass of Sherry.<br> I dislike Sherry as much as I deplore the<br> habit of dropping in on people uninvited.<br> [ Chuckles ] But, Mr.<br> Belvedere, I am inviting you.<br> And I, sir, am declining. Good day.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> [ Humming ]<br> Oh, here. Let me do<br> the mouth. That's awful.<br> Okay, mommy. We all<br> know you're a sculptress.<br> But hurry up. I wanna get this<br> finished before the kids get home.<br> Relax. They won't be<br> home for hours. Why?<br> Edna's taking them to her<br> house after Sunday school.<br> They're going to have lunch<br> with Susan and little bill.<br> Good morning,<br> Mr. Belvedere.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning, Mrs. King.<br> [ Harry ] Cold enough for<br> you? Nippy, but it suits me.<br> How do you like our snowman?<br> Mr. King, you should have<br> let your wife do the face.<br> I did the face.<br> Oh, well.<br> It will soon melt.<br> [ Door closes ] What do you<br> suppose he had in that package?<br> Darling, he's been here so long,<br> I've given up wondering<br> about anything he does or has.<br> It made a noise. I distinctly<br> heard a sort of metallic ticking.<br> So did I.<br> If he's doing anything illegal, we could<br> get into trouble. You know that, don't you?<br> Do you suppose you could<br> see from that limb there?<br> You go in the house<br> and watch his door.<br> If he comes out, find<br> some way to warn me. Okay.<br> [ Cracking ]<br> Mr. King?<br> Hmm?<br> - [ Yells ]<br> - [ Branches snap ]<br> [ Thud ]<br> Ow! Take it easy,<br> will ya?<br> Kindly keep still. You're<br> lucky that no bones are broken.<br> That's a very<br> professional bandage.<br> There aren't many people<br> who could do that.<br> That's substantially what general Pershing<br> told me during the first world war.<br> You were a doctor<br> too? A bone specialist.<br> Oh. Mr. Belvedere, is there<br> anything you haven't been?<br> Yes, Mrs. King, I've never<br> been an idler nor a parasite.<br> [ Bird chirps ]<br> Where on earth<br> did that...<br> that, Mrs. King, was the package which<br> you and Mr. King stared at so pointedly.<br> I'm opposed to the practice of<br> exchanging gifts at any time.<br> But since you<br> were gracious enough...<br> To give me three pairs of excellent woolen<br> socks on the occasion of my birthday,<br> I tried to get something<br> for your anniversary...<br> That would give pleasure<br> to your entire family.<br> How very kind of you.<br> Thank you, Mr. Belvedere.<br> Oh, he's beautiful.<br> Does he sing?<br> Not yet, but, uh,<br> I shall teach him.<br> [ Chirps ]<br> Darling, will six<br> shirts be enough? Sure.<br> Oh, will you need your tux? [ Chuckles ]<br> Look, sweetie, I'm going to Chicago<br> for a few days on business, not for fun.<br> Oh, it's getting late. don't<br> worry. Bill will be here.<br> Edna said he has<br> a business date downtown,<br> and he'll drop you off<br> at the station on the way.<br> Let me see now.<br> Socks, ties.<br> Oh, my shaving things.<br> I forgot.<br> Hi, funny face. How's the<br> bath coming? All right.<br> You gonna miss me when<br> I'm gone, hmm? [ Babbling ]<br> What?<br> [ Babbling ]<br> Oh, don't look at me like that<br> and laugh. [ Both laughing ]<br> Are you having fun, huh?<br> Mr. King.<br> Cutie, cutie. Huh?<br> I've been trying to teach Roddy that<br> bathing is not a social function.<br> Kindly do not talk to him.<br> Now then, Roddy, put the cloth in<br> the right hand, like that, and wash.<br> [ Door closes ]<br> And no conversation.<br> I don't care how good he is. There are<br> times when that genius gets on my nerves.<br> Oh, don't be so touchy.<br> I'm mad about him.<br> Hmm. Let's see.<br> Pullman tickets.<br> Money. Oh.<br> [ Horn honks ]<br> He'll be right down. He's<br> saying good-bye to the kids.<br> Okay.<br> That guy's gonna miss his<br> train. He'd better step on it.<br> [ Horn honking ]<br> Hurry up, dear. You<br> haven't much time. Okay.<br> You boys be good now, and<br> don't worry your mommy too much.<br> We won't. Good. Keep<br> the home fires burning.<br> Bye, pop...<br> father.<br> [ Chuckles ] Good-bye, son.<br> Good-bye, Mr. Belvedere.<br> Good-bye, Mr. King,<br> and don't worry.<br> During your absence, I shall endeavor to<br> pinch-hit for you at every opportunity.<br> Thanks, Mr. Belvedere.<br> Yes, darling, I know we'll get<br> along fine. [ Horn honking ]<br> Hmm. Come on. They're getting impatient.<br> Now, call me if you have time.<br> Oh, yes, while you're in Chicago,<br> will you go by Marshall fields...<br> And see if they have Larry's<br> size in those real heavy...<br> what's the matter?<br> Forget something?<br> I can't go.<br> Why?<br> Well, I can't leave you<br> here alone with Belvedere.<br> Why not? Bel... are<br> you out of your mind?<br> You seem to find him<br> very attractive.<br> I find the Grand Canyon attractive, but<br> that doesn't mean I'm in love with it.<br> You just got through saying<br> you're mad about him.<br> I am.<br> I'm insane with passion.<br> Hey, do you realize what<br> time it is? I'm not going.<br> Not going?<br> Well, why not?<br> This... this pillar of virtue<br> has suddenly decided...<br> That it wouldn't be safe to leave me<br> alone in the house with Mr. Belvedere.<br> Oh, are you kidding?<br> That's not the point at all.<br> Look, I'm not suggesting that you and<br> Belvedere will carry on while I'm gone.<br> Would you feel any better about your trip if<br> your wife slept at our house while you're gone?<br> - Yes, I would. Definitely.<br> - All right, it's settled then.<br> Just think, dear, Caesar's wife<br> is going to sleep at our house.<br> Good-bye now.<br> Of all the silly...<br> well, don't I get a kiss? No.<br> I'm a one-man woman, and my<br> heart belongs to Belvedere.<br> Oh.<br> Thanks, Edna.<br> Good-bye.<br> Bye. Have a good time.<br> And don't you be late, bill.<br> I won't.<br> [ Door closes ]<br> You know, I believe<br> he was actually jealous.<br> That's very gratifying. [ Mr.<br> Belvedere ] Most gratifying.<br> Although slightly suburban.<br> Mr. Belvedere, don't you consider<br> eavesdropping a bit unethical?<br> Quite unethical,<br> but, uh, fascinating.<br> I particularly enjoyed your<br> comparing me to the Grand Canyon.<br> Now there's rugged grandeur.<br> I shall put that in my diary.<br> [ Groaning ]<br> [ Sniffles ]<br> Larry.<br> Larry.<br> Huh?<br> Wake up. What's the matter with you?<br> My stomach hurts.<br> Bad?<br> Yeah, awful.<br> You must have ate<br> too much for supper.<br> Go on back to sleep<br> and you'll feel better.<br> I can't. It hurts.<br> Tell mom.<br> How can I? You know she's been<br> sleeping over at the Philbys'.<br> But I want my mom!<br> Shh!<br> Shut up.<br> It's nearly 3:00<br> in the morning,<br> and you'll wake up Roddy<br> and Mr. Belvedere.<br> I don't care.<br> Shh.<br> Look, Tony, I know. Why don't you stand<br> on your head like Mr. Belvedere taught us?<br> I already tried,<br> but I only threw up.<br> Okay. Okay. I'll wake him<br> up, but he won't like it.<br> He won't mind.<br> Oh, yes, he will.<br> He's a genius, and he needs<br> eight hours undisturbed sleep.<br> He says so all the time.<br> [ Groaning ]<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Here, Tony, drink this.<br> [ Groaning ]<br> What are you giving him? It's<br> all right. It's just ice water.<br> The water bottle got<br> smashed. Put it down.<br> Why? A drink of water<br> might be good for him.<br> When your mother gets here, she can drown<br> him in ice water as far as I'm concerned.<br> Until then, leave him alone,<br> and put it down.<br> [ Groaning ]<br> Sure you're calling<br> the right number?<br> Kindly credit me with enough intelligence<br> not to lose my head in a crisis.<br> Of course I'm calling<br> the right number.<br> [ Phone ringing ]<br> Hello.

Is he any better?<br> I think so.<br> A little better.<br> Tony, baby. Did you<br> take his temperature?<br> No. I'm satisfied that he<br> simply has a bellyache.<br> No more, no less.<br> [ Tony groaning ]<br> Is the pain very bad, dear? Show<br> me where it hurts. Right here.<br> Of course, I could have handled<br> this crisis perfectly well myself,<br> only the child expressed a<br> maudlin desire for his mother.<br> Come on, dear. I'll<br> take you upstairs to bed.<br> There now. Are you all right? Uh-huh.<br> Mom, you gonna sleep here now?<br> No, I'm going back<br> to Mrs. Philby's. Why?<br> Because... oh, well, never<br> mind. It's a long story.<br> Now, you boys sleep late in the morning.<br> I'll be here to get your breakfast.<br> And don't wake Mr. Belvedere.

Good night.<br> Silly woman. I'm sorry you<br> were disturbed, Mr. Belvedere.<br> I'm sure they'll go<br> right to sleep now.<br> Whereas I shall be plagued<br> with insomnia.<br> [ Doorbell buzzes ]<br> Now who could that be?<br> If you go to the door,<br> you need not conjecture.<br> Oh. Oh, please pardon<br> the intrusion, Mrs. King,<br> but I noticed<br> all your lights go on,<br> and, uh, knowing your husband<br> was away in Chicago,<br> I felt constrained to dash over<br> to see if anything was wrong.<br> No, thank you.<br> Everything is fine.<br> Well, just a neighborly call, you might<br> say, to offer my services if needed.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Good evening.<br> Or should I say good morning.<br> [ Scoffs ]<br> Did you borrow<br> your mother's binoculars...<br> To ascertain that our lights had<br> gone on? Oh, well, I, uh... I...<br> or were you perhaps looking<br> for pollen for your irises?<br> Well?<br> I see that I am not needed.<br> Your vision<br> is remarkably accurate.<br> Evil-minded little worm.<br> Do you know anyone who<br> has a beehive? What?<br> A good swarm of bees could<br> ruin his sheltered irises.<br> I know. But how could<br> you get them to swarm?<br> Uh, now don't tell me<br> you were also a beekeeper.<br> That is correct.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Good night.<br> Here you are, Mrs. Gibbs.<br> I know you'll enjoy it.<br> Thank you, Della. I certainly<br> liked the last one you recommended.<br> Good. Do come in again.<br> Oh, I will. Good-bye.<br> Good-bye, Mr. Appleton. Oh, Mrs. Gibbs.<br> So, what happened?<br> Well, as I was saying,<br> last night, or rather<br> early this morning,<br> I went over to the Harry kings'<br> on an errand of mercy,<br> and bear in mind Mr. King<br> has only been gone three days.<br> And there was Mr. Belvedere<br> in his pajamas,<br> and Tacey King<br> in a flimsy negligee.<br> Both of them cavorting about in the<br> most shameless way... drinking gin.<br> Why, I think it's the most...<br> what?<br> Oh, you're quite right, my dear.<br> It's my duty to tell Horatio.<br> Yes, of course. He demands<br> respectability above all things.<br> Mr. Hammond's office. Oh, yes,<br> Mrs. Hammond. One moment, please.<br> Yes?<br> Mrs. Hammond on the phone.<br> Oh, all right.<br> Yes, Martha, what is it?<br> No!<br> Why, that's outrageous.<br> And both of them drunk?<br> Well, go on.<br> What else did she say that Clarence<br> told her to tell you to tell me?<br> Uh-huh.<br> Hello, girls. [ Women ] Hello, Mr. King.<br> How are you, Peggy?<br> Everything under control?<br> Oh, yes, Mr. King,<br> and we got your wire.<br> Mr. Hammond was very pleased<br> that the matter was settled.<br> Swell. Uh, get my house for me,<br> will ya? I haven't been home yet.<br> But, Mr. King, Mr. Hammond wanted<br> to see you the moment you came in.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> I'll call the house later.<br> And that's where I nailed him.<br> He didn't have a comeback.<br> So, he talked it over with his clients,<br> and they signed on the dotted line.<br> Very good.<br> Very good, Harry.<br> Now, Mr. Hammond, uh,<br> how about that raise?<br> Uh, before<br> we discuss that, Harry,<br> there is something<br> of a personal nature,<br> of a very distressing nature,<br> which I feel it my duty<br> to take up with you.<br> I don't know<br> what you're driving at.<br> I am driving at this...<br> this Belvedere person.<br> Belvedere? Well, what's<br> Belvedere got to do with it?<br> Information has reached me, Harry, to<br> the effect that during your absence,<br> your wife and this Belvedere...<br> Have been having<br> quite a time for themselves.<br> [ Edna ]<br> Gee, Tacey, I think it's swell.<br> But do you think you've really<br> done justice to his nose?<br> Edna, will you wait<br> till it's finished?<br> I think it's darling of you, Mr. Belvedere,<br> to give Tacey a chance to practice like this.<br> My motives, Mrs. Philby,<br> are not entirely unselfish.<br> Someday they will need a bust<br> of me in the hall of fame.<br> The only virtue you lack,<br> Mr. Belvedere, is modesty.<br> - I do not consider that a virtue.<br> - Oh, I do.<br> That's what I like about Harry.<br> He's so modest.<br> Your husband has a great<br> deal to be modest about.<br> [ Clears throat ]<br> It amazes me how anybody can take wet mud,<br> mash it around and make it look like somebody.<br> Ladies, please. May I suggest less<br> conversation and more sculpture?<br> Oh, all right, all right.<br> This is very wearing.<br> I'm sorry. It's my fault. I just<br> meant to stop in for a moment.<br> I'll scram. Good-bye, Mr.<br> Belvedere. So long, sweetie.<br> Bye.<br> [ Door opens, closes ]<br> Your jaw isn't right.<br> My jaw is perfect.<br> Your reproduction is at fault.<br> You obviously have never<br> studied anatomy. Have you?<br> I have dissected many a cadaver.<br> Come here.<br> Now, if you place<br> your fingertips...<br> At the base of my jaw, so,<br> you can feel where the<br> orbicularis oris operates.<br> Now then, the jawbone.<br> That's okay.<br> [ Tacey ]<br> Mmm, do it some more.<br> [ Bird chirps ]<br> Well, this is<br> a cozy little scene.<br> Harry! I didn't expect you<br> till tonight. Obviously.<br> Would you mind telling me<br> just what you were doing?<br> I was permitting your wife<br> to massage my larynx.<br> And I might add, Mr. King, that<br> your greeting to your wife...<br> Is scarcely cordial,<br> to say the least.<br> You keep out of this. I'll<br> greet my wife any way I like.<br> Harry, what's the matter with<br> you? Oh, it's a fine thing.<br> I'm not back 10 minutes before Hammond<br> reads me the riot act about all this gossip.<br> Gossip? What gossip?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Gossip about you and Belvedere,<br> that's what I'm talking about.<br> And I don't mind telling you<br> it's jeopardizing my position.<br> Oh, stop ranting.<br> You're not in court.<br> Now look here, Tacey...<br> and stop raising your voice.<br> I'll raise the roof<br> if I want to.<br> Very well.<br> Oh, Tacey, I...<br> I'm willing to believe...<br> That all these rumors<br> about a drunken orgy...<br> In your nightclothes with Belvedere<br> are somewhat garbled, but...<br> so that's it.<br> Mr. Appleton's fine hand.<br> But, my gosh, when I came<br> in the house just now,<br> you were practically<br> holding him in your arms.<br> For heaven's sake,<br> you saw what I was doing.<br> She was merely feeling<br> my bone structure.<br> You shut up and listen.<br> I've been listening.<br> All I can hear<br> is a typical suburban husband...<br> Reacting in a typically<br> stupid and stuffy matter...<br> To a typical tempest<br> in a teapot.<br> He's right. And as for that<br> drunken orgy you were talking about,<br> Tony got us all up in the middle<br> of the night with a stomachache.<br> I dashed over from Edna's, and I<br> wasn't in the house a half an hour...<br> When that horrible little Mr.<br> Appleton came snooping around.<br> Oh. Well, I imagined<br> it was something like that.<br> Look, I'll admit<br> it is all pretty silly.<br> - Very silly.<br> - But...<br> go on.<br> Well, I was just thinking that<br> perhaps it might be simpler...<br> For everybody all around if... if Mr.<br> Belvedere sought employment elsewhere.<br> In other words, to satisfy<br> malicious gossips like Mr. Hammond,<br> Mr. Appleton and his awful mother,<br> you want to kick Mr. Belvedere out.<br> [ Harry ]<br> In a word, yes.<br> That is your final decision,<br> Mr. King?<br> Yes.

Then why didn't<br> you tell me this morning at breakfast?<br> I can be sleepy<br> and disagreeable too.<br> Our meeting was purely coincidental,<br> Mr. King, but most enjoyable.<br> Then you admit it.

Mr. King, I<br> never jest about a million dollars.<br> Money is the root of all evil, and I<br> have the greatest possible respect for it.<br> Okay, Mr. Belvedere. We'll<br> be very happy to defend you.<br> Good.<br> How about it, bill?<br> It's a deal.<br> The offices of King and Philby<br> will open tomorrow morning.<br> And they'll have their work cut out for<br> them, because we intend to sue not only you...<br> But everybody who supplied you<br> with this libelous information.<br> Good idea. You should<br> always go to the source.<br> I intend to.<br> Has it occurred to any of you<br> gentlemen who that source might be?<br> Who is the person who knows all<br> about everyone on hummingbird hill?<br> Who is the one that for years<br> has made a repulsive habit...<br> Of snooping and gossiping about<br> his neighbors? [ Appleton gulps ]<br> Who is it among us who knows our little<br> peccadilloes with girls in florist shops?<br> The girl was merely delivering<br> flowers to that motel.<br> But they were not orange<br> blossoms. And you, Mr. Mcpherson...<br> you caricatured me in this<br> book as a notorious lush.<br> It was not I who counted the empties taken<br> away from your house by the garbageman.<br> Just one little moment.<br> Are you insinuating that...<br> I let the chips fall<br> where they may. But I...<br> and, Mr. Hammond, who is it that makes<br> a habit of reading other people's mail,<br> other people's perfumed mail?<br> Oh, this is outrageous. Are you suggesting<br> that I have been your... your collaborator?<br> don't be presumptuous.<br> Let me put it in terms that<br> even you will understand.<br> You have spread the pollen.<br> I have reaped the harvest.<br> But I...<br> this is fantastic.<br> I have been more grossly maligned<br> in the book than... than anyone.<br> It is only poetic justice that<br> a stool pigeon should be roasted.<br> So, you're the one. Now, now,<br> Horatio, let's not be hasty.<br> Why, you little weasel.<br> No, no, Horatio! No! No! No!<br> [ All yelling ]<br> Mother!<br> Mother! Mother! Mother!<br> I'd give my right arm to get a look<br> at Appleton with that black eye.<br> I bet it nearly killed him when<br> they trampled down his Iris bed.<br> Yeah.<br> How would you like to go<br> celebrating tomorrow night?<br> Love to. Would you<br> care to take me dancing?<br> Yes. But remember, I don't<br> dance as well as Mr. Belvedere.<br> No, dear,<br> but you're much prettier.<br> Wait a minute.<br> We can't.<br> Who'll sit with the kids?<br> [ Mr. Belvedere ] I will.<br> The mere fact that I have<br> been catapulted into fame...<br> Does not blind me to the<br> duties I undertook here.<br> Mr. Belvedere,<br> you're an amazing man.<br> Just what are your plans<br> for the future?<br> My dear Mrs. King,<br> hummingbird hill is only the<br> first volume of a trilogy.<br> I estimate the other two volumes<br> will take me about two years.<br> Uh, and you're going to<br> write them here?<br> Naturally.<br> Posterity will demand that the entire<br> masterpiece be written under the same roof.<br> This house will become a shrine.<br> I'm surprised<br> you even want to stay.<br> It can't be very convenient. You<br> claim you don't even like children.<br> That is correct.<br> [ Tacey ] Mr. Belvedere? Yes?<br> I think it only fair to<br> tell you that before long,<br> we are expecting another child.<br> And you'll find me<br> of great service, Mrs. King.<br> I was also an obstetrician.<br> [ Bird twittering ]<br> [ Chorus ]<br> Pretty baby<br>
