                        - My God!<br> - Is anything gone?<br> - How can I look? I'm shaking.<br> - I wanna know if anything's gone.<br> - Calm down.<br> - We could've been killed. The Kandinsky!<br> - The Kandinsky!<br> - It's gone! Oh, my God! Call the police!<br> There it is. The silver Victorian inkwell.<br> - How can you think about things?!<br> - There's the inkwell.<br> - We could have been murdered!<br> - Silver jaguar.<br> Why?<br> - Slashed. Throats slashed.<br> - There's the Degas.<br> Go to bed at night happy and then<br> murdered. Would we have woken up?<br> We're alive.<br> - (dog yelps)<br> - (both scream)<br> The dog, the dog, the dog. Oh, God.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - What is it?<br> The wedding.<br> We have to go to the wedding.<br> - I'm in no mood to go.<br> - We have to.<br> - They're your friends.<br> - I beg to differ...<br> - Hello?!<br> - What?<br> You don't call out "hello" unless the...<br> I think we could tell<br> if someone else was here.<br> - We didn't all night.<br> - (phone rings)<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Bride's side or groom's side?<br> Either side. I can't even<br> remember how we met them.<br> Why are we here?<br> Let's not make a scene.<br> The most terrifying words in the world -<br> - "Now I lay me down to sleep... " Think.<br> - "Pray the Lord my soul to keep".<br> But then the nightmare part.<br> "If I should die before I wake... "<br> "Pray the Lord my soul to take".<br> - Are you OK?<br> - We were nearly murdered.<br> - Throats slashed.<br> - It was awful.<br> - You could've been killed?<br> - Only hours ago.<br> - But we're here.<br> - We wouldn't miss it.<br> Happy the bride the sun shines on.<br> ("Here Comes the Bride")<br> Chaos, control. Chaos, control.<br> You like? You like?<br> - I'll have a gin and tonic, please.<br> - Tell them.<br> We were having<br> a wonderful evening last night.<br> A friend we hadn't seen in years<br> came by for dinner.<br> - Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa.<br> - Don't say that so portentously.<br> - Geoffrey from Serth Efrica.<br> - Well, don't be gaga!<br> - Scotch, please.<br> - Just something large.<br> Geoffrey was in New York<br> briefly on business,<br> and he asked us to ask him for dinner.<br> Listen.<br> What's wrong?<br> It always amazes me<br> when New York is so quiet.<br> Oh! (laughs)<br> With the kids away,<br> we get used to less noise.<br> - Geoffrey is King-Midas rich. Gold mines.<br> - 70,000 workers in one gold mine alone.<br> But he's short of cash.<br> His government won't let its people...<br> - Its white people.<br> ...take out any money.<br> It's like taking in a war baby.<br> His call was like a bolt from the blue, as<br> I had a deal coming up and was short by...<br> - Two million.<br> - The figure is superfluous.<br> I hate when you use<br> the word "superfluous".<br> I mean, he needed two million.<br> We hadn't seen Geoffrey in a long time.<br> While he might not have the price<br> of dinner, he might have $2,000,000.<br> It's the awful thing about<br> having truly rich friends.<br> Let's face it, the money does<br> get in the way. I'll take that one.<br> Having a rich friend is like drowning<br> and he makes lifeboats.<br> Only your friend gets very touchy if you<br> say one word - lifeboat. That is two words.<br> We were afraid our friend might say we<br> were loving him because of his lifeboat.<br> We weren't sucking up. We like Geoffrey.<br> (applause)<br> - Shouldn't we...?<br> - Not on your life.<br> - It was hardly a lifeboat evening.<br> - Portentous.<br> But when Geoffrey called<br> and asked us to take him for dinner,<br> he made a pattern in life's tea leaves,<br> because who wants to go to banks?<br> Why do you stay in South Africa?<br> One has to stay there<br> to educate the black workers.<br> We'll know we've been successful<br> when they kill us.<br> - Planning the revolution to destroy you.<br> - Putting your life on the line.<br> You don't think of it like that.<br> I wish you'd visit.<br> Oh, but we'd visit you<br> and sit in your gorgeous house,<br> planning visits to the townships,<br> demanding to see the poorest of the poor.<br> "Are you sure they're the worst off?<br> I mean, we've come all this way".<br> "We don't want to see people just mildly<br> victimised by apartheid. We want shock".<br> It doesn't seem right sitting on<br> the East Side talking about revolution.<br> Only small, murky cafs<br> for Pp le Moko here.<br> No. No. La Pasionaria. We'll build<br> barricades and lean against them, singing.<br> - And the people will follow.<br> - Follow, follow, follow. What is that song?<br> It's our role in history,<br> and we offer ourselves up to it.<br> It's your role in history, it's not our role.<br> The Fantasticks.<br> Follow, follow, follow, follow<br> A role in history - to say that so easily.<br> To lead the people. Like Lech Walesa<br> and the striking shipyard workers.<br> Gorbachev urging on<br> the striking coal miners.<br> The phrase "striking coal miners" -<br> I always picture these very striking<br> coal miners modelling the fall fashion.<br> - Why is there a statue of a husky?<br> - Another drink before we...?<br> Where shall we?<br> God, the restaurants in New York.<br> It's like Florence in the 16th century -<br> genius on every corner.<br> - There's good Szechwan. Hunan.<br> - (woman laughs)<br> The sign painter screwed up the sign.<br> Instead of painting "The Hunan Wok",<br> he painted "The Human Wok".<br> - We sent it to The Times.<br> - They have a joke page, and...<br> They send you champagne.<br> We weren't auditioning, but all I could<br> think was "$2,000,000. $2,000,000".<br> Like when people say "Don't think<br> about elephants", it's all you think.<br> $2,000,000. $2,000,000.<br> (buzzer)<br> Whatever you do,<br> don't think about elephants.<br> - Elephants?<br> - Ouisa is a Dada manifesto.<br> About the Czanne.<br> Unless we're careful,<br> it'll be sold and never seen again.<br> Mid period. Landscape<br> of a dark green forest.<br> In the far distance you see the sunlight.<br> One of his first uses of a pale colour being<br> forced to carry the weight of the picture.<br> An experiment that would<br> pay off in the apples.<br> Burst of colour has to carry so much.<br> Japanese don't like anything<br> about it except it's a Czanne.<br> I... I'm so sorry to bother you, but...<br> I've been hurt, and l've lost everything.<br> I didn't know where to go. Your children.<br> I'm a friend of your children.<br> - He mentioned our kids' names.<br> - And their school.<br> - Harvard. You can say Harvard.<br> - I don't want to get into libel.<br> I was mugged... out there in Central Park.<br> By the statue of that Alaskan husky.<br> I was trying to figure out<br> why there was a statue of a dog<br> who saved lives in the Yukon<br> in the middle of Central Park.<br> - When I was trying to puzzle it out...<br> - Are you OK?<br> They took my money and my briefcase.<br> I said "My thesis..".<br> - His shirt's bleeding.<br> - The shirt isn't bleeding. He's bleeding.<br> Oh.<br> Sorry. I get this way around blood.<br> No! My God, not on the rug, please.<br> Eddie, get the doctor.<br> No. No. I'll survive.<br> No doctors. Please?<br> All right, Eddie. We'll call you.<br> Thank you, Eddie.<br> Um...<br> (stranger) I don't mind the money.<br> But in the age of mechanical reproduction,<br> they got the only copy of my thesis.<br> Ouisa, where's the first-aid book?<br> The Red Cross advises<br> "Press edges of wound firmly together".<br> - Yes, I'm doing that.<br> - (screams)<br> Hold on. Ouisa, I need gauze.<br> - It's been wonderful seeing you.<br> - No. Stay.<br> My time is so short.<br> Before I leave America, I really should...<br> - Did you see the new book on Czanne?<br> - Er, no. May I use the phone?<br> An absolute revelation.<br> I ran down the hall...<br> $2,000,000. $2,000,000.<br> ...got the book on Czanne,<br> got the gauze from the kitchen,<br> gave the Czanne to Flan,<br> and the gauze to Geoffrey.<br> Ouisa!<br> $2,000,000. $2,000,000.<br> It's a lovely book.<br> I'll get him a clean shirt. Please stay.<br> - And peace was restored.<br> - And then...<br> Your children said you were kind.<br> All the kids were sitting around the dorm<br> dishing the... shit out of their parents.<br> But your kids were silent. They said<br> "No. Not our parents. Not Flan and Ouisa".<br> "Not the Kittredges.<br> The Kittredges are kind".<br> So, after the muggers left, I looked up,<br> saw these Fifth Avenue apartments.<br> Mrs 0nassis lives there.<br> I know the Babcocks live over there.<br> The Auchinclosses live there.<br> But... you lived here.<br> I came here.<br> Can you believe what the kids said?<br> Mm. Well...<br> He mentioned our kids' names.<br> We can mention our kids' names. They<br> won't sue us for mentioning their names.<br> Talbot and Woody mean the world to me.<br> Woody? He lets you call him Woody?<br> Nobody's called him Woody in years.<br> They described this apartment in detail.<br> Oh, this is a Kandinsky!<br> A double - one painted on either side.<br> May I see?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Extraordinary.<br> What makes it exceptional is that<br> Kandinsky painted on either side of the<br> canvas in two radically different styles.<br> One wild and vivid,<br> the other sombre and geometric.<br> My God!<br> We flip it around for variety.<br> Chaos, control. Chaos, control.<br> You like? You like?<br> It's wonderful.<br> (Flan) Vasili Kandinsky.<br> Born 1866, Moscow.<br> Blue Rider exhibition, 1914.<br> He said "The choice of object that is one<br> of the elements in the harmony of form<br> must be decided only by a corresponding<br> vibration in the human soul".<br> Died 1944, France.<br> Everything is just the way<br> they said it would be.<br> Did you bitch your parents?<br> As a matter of fact, no.<br> Your kids and I, we both liked our -<br> liked? - loved our parents.<br> Am I getting in the way here? I'm sorry.<br> I burst in here hysterical... blood...<br> No. No, no. No, no, no, please.<br> No, please. Please. Sit down.<br> Tell us about our children.<br> Three. Two at Harvard,<br> and a girl at Groton.<br> - How is Harvard?<br> - Well, fine. It's just there.<br> Everyone's in a constant<br> state of luxurious despair<br> and constant discovery and paralysis.<br> - We asked him where home was.<br> - "0ut West" he said.<br> Although I've lived all over.<br> My folks are divorced. He's remarried.<br> - Actually, he's doing a movie.<br> - He's in the movies?<br> - He's directing this one, but he does act.<br> - Really? Um...<br> - What's he directing?<br> - Cats.<br> - Someone is directing a film of Cats?<br> - Don't be snooty.<br> - You've seen it? TS Eliot?<br> - (Flan) Yes, years ago.<br> It was a benefit for some school...<br> or disease... What?<br> - They can't make the movie of Cats.<br> - Of course they can.<br> They're going to try.<br> My father'll be here, auditioning.<br> Cats?<br> - He's going to use people.<br> - What a courageous stand.<br> - They thought of animation...<br> - Animation would be nice.<br> But he found a better way. As a matter<br> of fact, he turned it down at first.<br> He went to tell the producers the reasons<br> why you couldn't make a movie of Cats.<br> And in going through the reasons why you<br> couldn't, he suddenly saw how you could.<br> Eureka in the bathtub. How wonderful!<br> May we ask who?<br> And it was then we pulled up -<br> ever so slightly - pulled up closer.<br> And he told us.<br> He named the greatest<br> black star in movies. Sidney...<br> No names! No names! We're trying<br> to keep this abstract. Plus, libel laws.<br> Sidney Poitier. There. I don't care!<br> You have to have truth!<br> He started out as a lawyer<br> and is terrified of libel. I'm not.<br> Sidney Poitier.<br> The future Jackie Robinson of films was<br> born 24th of February 1927 in Miami<br> during a visit his parents made to Florida.<br> (man) Legally?<br> To sell tomatoes<br> they had grown in the Bahamas.<br> He grew up on Cat Island so poor they<br> didn't even own dirt, he has said.<br> Neglected by his family, my father would<br> sit on the shore, and, as he's told me:<br> "Conjure up the worlds that were on<br> the other side, and what I'd do in them".<br> He arrived in New York City from<br> the Bahamas in the winter of 1943<br> at the age of 15 and a half, and lived<br> in the pay toilet of the bus station<br> across from the old Madison<br> Square Garden at 50th and 8th Avenue.<br> He moved to the roof of the Brill Building,<br> commonly known as Tin Pan Alley,<br> washed dishes at the Turf Restaurant<br> for $4 and 11 cents a night.<br> He taught himself to read<br> by reading the newspaper.<br> In the black newspaper, the theatre page<br> was opposite the want-ad page.<br> Among his 42 films are:<br> No Way Out, 1950, Cry, the Beloved<br> Country, 1952, Blackboard Jungle, 1955,<br> The Defiant Ones, 1958, A Raisin in<br> the Sun, 1961, Lilies of the Field, 1963,<br> In the Heat of the Night, 1967, To Sir,<br> with Love, 1967, Shoot to Kill, 1988,<br> and, of course...<br> Guess Who's Coming to Dinner!<br> He won the 0scar for Lilies of the Field,<br> and was twice named top box-office star.<br> My father made no films from 1977 to<br> Dad said to me once:<br> "I still don't fully understand<br> how all this came about<br> in the sequence it came about".<br> (someone claps)<br> Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry.<br> I came down from Cambridge. I thought<br> I'd stay at some fleabag for adventure.<br> Orwell, Down and Out...<br> I don't really know New York. I know<br> Rome, Paris and Los Angeles a lot better.<br> Well, we're going out to dinner.<br> You'll come.<br> - Out to dinner?<br> - Out to dinner.<br> - The new Italian looked cheery.<br> - Good. We've made reservations.<br> - They wrap up ravioli like saltwater taffy.<br> - Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars.<br> But why go out to dinner?<br> Because we have reservations. What time<br> is it? Have we lost the reservations?<br> There's nothing in the house. And it's 16th<br> century Florence, genius on every block.<br> - Don't mock.<br> - You must have something in the fridge.<br> A frozen steak from the Ice Age.<br> But why spend $100 on a bowl of rice?<br> Let me into the kitchen.<br> Cooking calms me. And what I'd like to do<br> is calm down. Pay back your kids.<br> - Two at Harvard. A daughter at Groton.<br> - Who've been wonderful.<br> - They never mentioned you.<br> - What'd they say?<br> "We know the son of Sidney Poitier,<br> barrier-breaker of the '50s and '60s"?<br> Your father means<br> a great deal in South Africa.<br> I'm glad of that. Dad and I went<br> to Russia once, to a film festival.<br> He was amazed how much<br> his presence meant.<br> No, no. Tell us stories of movie stars<br> tying up their children, being cruel.<br> - I wish.<br> - You wish?<br> If I wanted to write a book about him, I<br> really can't. No one would want to read it.<br> He's decent, and I admire him.<br> in... um... um... She's white. Am I right?<br> That's not my mother. It's his second wife.<br> He met Joanna making The Lost Man,<br> and left my mother, who'd stuck by him<br> in the lean years. I had just been born.<br> The Lost Man is the only film of my<br> father's I can't bring myself to see.<br> - I'm so sorry. We didn't mean...<br> - No, no, no.<br> We're all good friends now, his kids<br> from that marriage and us - the old kids.<br> I'd love to get into that kitchen.<br> - What should we do?<br> - It's Geoffrey's only night in New York.<br> - I vote to stay in.<br> - Good!<br> We moved into the kitchen.<br> - We watched him cook.<br> - We watched him chop.<br> He did a sort of wizardry.<br> Leftovers. Onions.<br> - (Ouisa) Peppers.<br> - Tuna. 0lives.<br> - (Ouisa) A jar of sun-dried tomatoes.<br> - It was wonderful.<br> - So, you're from...?<br> - Johannesburg.<br> My dad took me to a movie<br> shot in South Africa.<br> The camera moves from<br> this vile rioting in the streets<br> to a villa where people picked<br> at lunch on a terrace.<br> The only riot, the flowers and the birds.<br> Gorgeous plumage and petals.<br> I didn't understand.<br> Dad said to me "You meet these young<br> blacks who are having a terrible time".<br> "They've had an inadequate education,<br> yet, in '76, the year of the Soweto riots,<br> they took on great political responsibility.<br> Just makes you wonder at their maturity".<br> It makes you realise that<br> the "crummy-childhood" theory,<br> that everything can be blamed in<br> a Freudian fashion on a bad upbringing,<br> just doesn't hold water.<br> May I?<br> What about being black in America?<br> Well, my problem is I've never felt<br> American. I grew up in Switzerland.<br> Boarding school. Villa Rosey.<br> There's a boarding school in Switzerland<br> that will take you at age 18 months.<br> No, no, no, no. That's not me. I've never<br> felt people liked me for my connections.<br> And movie-star-kid problems?<br> None of those.<br> I never knew I was black in that racist way<br> till I was 16 and came back here.<br> Very, very protected.<br> White servants.<br> After the divorce, we moved to<br> Switzerland - my mother, brother and I.<br> I don't feel American. I don't even feel<br> black. I suppose that's very lucky for me.<br> Even though Freud says<br> there's no such thing as luck.<br> Does Freud say that?<br> I think we're lucky having this dinner.<br> - Flan, can we eat in the dining room?<br> - Dining room.<br> Now, now, don't look at<br> the sewing machine.<br> So, is everything OK?<br> - This is the best pasta I've ever tasted.<br> - The best!<br> - My father insisted we learn to cook.<br> - He's from Jamaica, isn't he?<br> There's a taste of, um...<br> - The islands.<br> - Yes. Yeah.<br> Yes, before he made it,<br> he ran four restaurants in Harlem.<br> - You, sir, have good buds.<br> - "Good buds?"<br> I've never been<br> complimented on my buds.<br> - This is delicious.<br> - What about you?<br> Oh, no, no, no. The cook never eats.<br> What a good idea.<br> That means there's more for us.<br> - It's a treat to eat at home.<br> - We go out every night.<br> I have to. Business.<br> Have you declared your major yet?<br> You are like all parents -<br> "What's your major?"<br> Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles<br> the students give the courses.<br> "The holocaust and ethics"?<br> "Krauts and doubts".<br> A toast. To you.<br> Oh. No, no, no.<br> - To Cats.<br> - OK. Yes. To Cats.<br> Isn't this the finest time?<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> - Seconds?<br> - Ah!<br> Blunt question. What's he like?<br> - Oh, let's not be star-fuckers.<br> - I'm not a star-fucker.<br> Well... you know my father. He's... perfect.<br> So confident and in control.<br> And I used to wonder how could<br> I ever possibly live up to him.<br> And then one night, when I was 16 -<br> we were at the Cannes Film Festival,<br> of all places -<br> I looked up and said to him:<br> "Wow, Dad, this is all so easy for you".<br> Why did I say that?<br> He sat me down and set me straight.<br> Actually, it was a relief for me<br> to know my father was no superman.<br> That he has problems. And there are<br> moments in his life when he's scared.<br> And, yes, sometimes<br> life is whipping his tail.<br> And he doesn't feel like he can get<br> through the day. That's refreshing for me.<br> Because I have times like that myself.<br> I just loved the kid so much.<br> I wanted to reach out to him.<br> Then we asked him<br> what his thesis was on.<br> - The one that was stolen.<br> - Well...<br> A teacher out on Long Island was dropped<br> from his job for fighting with a student.<br> Weeks later, he returned to the classroom,<br> shot the student - unsuccessfully,<br> held the class hostage,<br> and then shot himself - successfully.<br> This fact caught my eye.<br> Last sentence, Times -<br> "A neighbour described<br> the teacher as a nice boy,<br> always reading Catcher in the Rye. "<br> This nitwit Chapman,<br> who shot John Lennon,<br> said he did it to draw the attention<br> of the world to Catcher in the Rye,<br> and the reading of this book<br> would be his defence.<br> Young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot<br> Reagan and his press secretary, said:<br> "If you want my defence, all you<br> have to do is read... Catcher in the Rye. "<br> - I haven't read it in years.<br> - Shh.<br> I borrowed a copy from a young friend.<br> I wanted to see what she had underlined.<br> And I read this book to find out why<br> this touching, beautiful, sensitive story,<br> published in July 1951,<br> had turned into this manifesto of hate.<br> I started reading. It's exactly as I had<br> remembered. Everybody's a phoney.<br> Page two - "My brother's<br> in Hollywood being a prostitute".<br> Page three -<br> "What a phoney slob his father was".<br> Page nine -<br> "People never notice anything".<br> Then, on page 22, my hair stood up.<br> Well...<br> Remember Holden Caulfield, the definitive<br> sensitive youth wearing his hunter's cap?<br> A deer hunter's cap?<br> "Like hell it is. I sort of closed one eye<br> like I was taking aim at it".<br> "This is a people shooting hat".<br> "I shoot people in this hat".<br> This book is preparing people for bigger<br> moments than I had ever dreamed of.<br> Then, on page 89,<br> "I'd rather push a guy out the window<br> or chop his head off with an axe<br> than sock him in the jaw".<br> "I hate fistfights. What scares<br> me most is the other guy's face".<br> I finished the book.<br> It's touching and comic.<br> The boy wants to do so much<br> and can't do anything.<br> Hates all phoniness<br> and only lies to others.<br> Wants everyone to like him but is only<br> hateful and is completely self involved.<br> In other words, a pretty accurate<br> picture of a male adolescent.<br> What alarms me about the book - not the<br> book so much as the aura about it - is this.<br> The book is primarily about paralysis.<br> The boy can't function.<br> At the end, before he can run away and<br> start a new life, it starts to rain. He folds.<br> There's nothing wrong in writing about<br> emotional and intellectual paralysis.<br> It may, thanks to Chekhov and Samuel<br> Beckett, be the great modern theme.<br> The extraordinary last lines<br> of Waiting for Godot;<br> "Let's go".<br> "Yes".<br> "Let's go".<br> Stage directions:<br> "They do not move".<br> The aura around Salinger's book -<br> which, perhaps, should be<br> read by everyone but young men - is this.<br> It mirrors like a fun-house mirror,<br> and amplifies like a distorted speaker<br> one of the great tragedies of our times -<br> the death of the imagination.<br> Because what else is paralysis?<br> The imagination has been<br> so debased that imagination...<br> being imaginative, rather than<br> being the linchpin of our existence,<br> now stands as a synonym for<br> something outside ourselves.<br> Like science fiction.<br> Or some new use for tangerine slices<br> on raw pork chops -<br> "What an imaginative summer recipe".<br> And Star Wars - "so imaginative".<br> And Star Trek - "so imaginative".<br> And Lord of the Rings,<br> all those dwarves - "so imaginative".<br> The imagination has moved out<br> of the realm of being our link,<br> our most personal link, with our inner<br> lives and the world outside that world,<br> this world we share.<br> What is schizophrenia<br> but a horrifying state<br> where what's in here<br> doesn't match what's out there?<br> Why has imagination<br> become a synonym for style?<br> I believe the imagination<br> is the passport that we create<br> to help take us into the real world.<br> I believe the imagination is merely another<br> phrase for what is most uniquely us.<br> Jung says "The greatest sin<br> is to be unconscious".<br> Our boy Holden says "What scares me<br> most is the other guy's face".<br> "It wouldn't be so bad<br> if you could both be blindfolded".<br> Most of the time, the faces that we face<br> are not the other guys', but our own faces.<br> And it is the worst kind of yellowness<br> to be so scared of yourself<br> that you put blindfolds on<br> rather than deal with yourself.<br> To face ourselves - that's the hard thing.<br> The imagination...<br> that's God's gift to make<br> the act of self-examination bearable.<br> Well...<br> Indeed.<br> - I hope your muggers read every word.<br> - (Ouisa laughs) Oh, darling!<br> I'm going to buy Catcher in the Rye<br> at the airport and read it.<br> - Cover to cover.<br> - I'll test you.<br> - I should be going.<br> - Where will you stay?<br> Oh, no, not some fleabag.<br> No, no, no. I get into the Sherry tomorrow<br> morning. It's not far off. I can walk around.<br> - I don't think they'll mug me twice.<br> - You'll stay here tonight.<br> No. I have to be at the hotel at 7 am sharp.<br> - We'll get you up.<br> - Or Dad will have a fit.<br> Up at 6.15, which is any moment now.<br> And we have that wedding.<br> - There's an alarm by the bed.<br> - Your feet may hang over the edge...<br> - If it's any problem...<br> - The only problem is if you leave.<br> - And we want to be in Cats.<br> - Oh, Flan!<br> - It's done!<br> - I'll fly back... with my wife.<br> Well... Pushy, both of you.<br> You're not. Dad said I could be in charge<br> of the extras. That's all I can promise.<br> - In cat suits?<br> - No, you can be humans.<br> That's very important. It has to be<br> in our contracts. We are humans.<br> We haven't got any business done.<br> Oh, forget it.<br> It was just an evening at home.<br> Whatever you do,<br> don't think about elephants.<br> - Did I intrude?<br> - No.<br> There are all ways of doing business.<br> Flan, walk me to the elevator.<br> We embraced, and Flan and Geoffrey left.<br> - Let me clean up.<br> - No, no. Please leave it.<br> - Nobody comes in on Sunday.<br> - No. Yvonne'll be in on Tuesday.<br> - You'll have every bug in Christendom.<br> - Let me.<br> No! You watch.<br> It gives me a thrill to be looked at.<br> - Ouisa! He's in.<br> - He's in?<br> For two million.<br> Says the Czanne is a great investment.<br> We should get six million for it<br> and sell it for ten.<br> Happy days! Oh, God!<br> - Oh, break all those dishes!<br> - $2,000,000?<br> Figure it out. He doesn't have the price<br> of dinner, but he can cough up $2,000,000.<br> - And the Japanese will go to ten.<br> - Go to ten? Ten million?<br> Two million, go to ten,<br> and we put up nothing.<br> - Nothing?<br> - No.<br> Wildest dreams. Oh, God, Paul. Money.<br> - Take $50.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - It's walking-around money.<br> - I don't need it.<br> - What if your father's plane is late?<br> - A billionth of a per cent commission.<br> I wouldn't want one of my kids<br> stuck in the street without a nickel.<br> Your kids said you were an art dealer, but<br> you have no gallery. I don't understand.<br> Come here.<br> - Some people want to sell privately.<br> - Divorce, taxes, publicity...<br> - People ask me for certain schools.<br> - Modern, Impressionist...<br> - They don't want museums to know.<br> - Japanese.<br> I've got Japanese looking for a Czanne.<br> I have a syndicate that'll buy the painting.<br> And there's this great Czanne coming<br> up for sale in a very messy divorce.<br> Wife doesn't want hubby to know...<br> l needed an extra $2,000,000.<br> Geoffrey called. We invited him for dinner.<br> - Tonight was a nervous, casual, big thing.<br> - Oh, boy, oh, boy.<br> - I couldn't tell.<br> - All the better.<br> I'm glad I helped.<br> You were wonderful.<br> I'm so pleased I was wonderful.<br> - All this and a pink shirt.<br> - Oh, please, keep it. Look at the time.<br> Oh, God. We should say our good-nights.<br> Oh, Christ, regretfully.<br> I want my father to meet you.<br> - We'd love to. Bring him up for dinner.<br> - Could I?<br> - See how easy it is?<br> - Sure. If Paul does the cooking.<br> Well, this is it.<br> - Good night.<br> - Oh. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> I want to get down<br> on my knees and thank God.<br> Money!<br> Who said "When artists dream,<br> they dream of money"?<br> God, I must be such an artist.<br> Bravo. Bravo!<br> Bravo!<br> Oh, God!<br> I don't want to lose our life here. I don't<br> want all the debt to pile up and crush us.<br> It won't. We're safe.<br> For a while.<br> We almost lost it, 0uis.<br> If I hadn't gotten this money, I would have<br> lost the Czanne. I had nowhere to find it.<br> Why don't you tell me<br> how much these things mean?<br> You wait until the last minute.<br> - I don't want to worry you.<br> - Not worry me?<br> I'm your partner.<br> - There is a God!<br> - And his name is?<br> - Geoffrey!<br> - No! Sidney!<br> You know, I had the strangest dream.<br> I dreamt of Cats.<br> (purring and mewing)<br> The movie.<br> Paul... I'm worried.<br> Is it right to make a movie of Cats?<br> I'll tell you why there has to be a movie<br> of Cats, Ouisa. May I call you Ouisa?<br> Yes.<br> I have no illusions<br> about the merits of Cats,<br> but the world has been<br> too heavy with the right-to-lifers -<br> protect the unborn, constitutional<br> amendments, when does life begin?<br> Or the converse - the end of life, the right<br> to die. Why is life, at this point in time,<br> so focused upon the very beginning of life<br> and the very end of life?<br> What about the 80 years we have to live<br> between those two inexorable book ends?<br> And you can get all that into Cats?<br> We're going to try.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> You shall.<br> This is what I dreamt.<br> I didn't dream, so much as realise this.<br> I feel so close to the paintings.<br> I'm not just selling, like pieces of meat.<br> I remembered why I loved paintings<br> in the first place, what got me into this.<br> I thought...<br> dreamt...<br> remembered...<br> how easy it is for a painter<br> to lose a painting.<br> He paints and paints,<br> works on a canvas for months,<br> and then, one day, he loses it.<br> Loses the structure, loses the sense of it.<br> You lose the painting.<br> I remembered asking my kids'<br> second-grade teacher:<br> "Why are all your students geniuses?"<br> Look at the first grade - blotches of green<br> and black. The third grade - camouflage.<br> But your grade, the second grade...<br> Matisses, every one.<br> You've made my child a Matisse.<br> Let me study with you.<br> Let me into the second grade.<br> What is your secret?<br> I don't have any secret. I just know when<br> to take their drawings away from them.<br> I dreamt of colour.<br> I dreamt of our son's pink shirt.<br> I dreamt of pinks and yellows.<br> And the new Van Gogh<br> the Museum of Modern Art got.<br> And the irises that sold for $53.9 million.<br> And, wishing a Van Gogh was mine,<br> l looked at my English hand-lasted shoes,<br> and thought of Van Gogh's tragic shoes,<br> and remembered me as I was -<br> a painter losing a painting.<br> So. This morning.<br> I sat in the kitchen, happily doing<br> the crossword puzzle in ink.<br> Everybody does it in ink.<br> I've never met one person<br> who didn't say they didn't do it in ink.<br> I sat there happily doing the puzzle.<br> I looked at the time. It was nearly seven.<br> And Paul had to meet his father,<br> and I didn't want him to be late.<br> (groaning)<br> Paul?<br> - Paul?<br> - (groaning)<br> Paul, are you 0K?<br> Paul?<br> What the fuck's goin' on here?<br> Who the fuck are you?<br> Flan!<br> Flan!<br> (Flan) Ouisa?<br> What is it?<br> - God! There's someone in the house.<br> - Someone's in the...?<br> - Yes, hello?<br> - Frank? I need help up here right away.<br> - Hey. How you doin'?<br> - My God!<br> Ho-ho-ho!<br> Nice stuff!<br> - Fancy chair.<br> - Oh! Ouisa! Argh!<br> - I can explain.<br> - You went out and picked up this thing?<br> You brought this thing into our house?!<br> Thing! Thing! Get out of my house!<br> - Stop it! He might have a gun!<br> - A gun?!<br> Yeah, I might have a gun.<br> I might have a knife!<br> Oh! Ouisa!<br> Get out! Get out! Get out!<br> Take your clothes<br> and go back to the gutter!<br> Take it easy with my pants!<br> - Fuck you!<br> - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br> - Please, don't tell my father.<br> - Just go.<br> - I got so lonely and so afraid...<br> - Give me back my $50.<br> I spent it. You had so much.<br> I couldn't be alone!<br> Get out.<br> - Get out.<br> - Everything all right?<br> Make sure they leave - by the back door.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> (gasping)<br> - My God!<br> - Is anything gone?<br> - How can I look? I'm shaking.<br> - I wanna know if anything's gone.<br> - Calm down.<br> - We could've been killed. The Kandinsky!<br> Kandinsky! Oh, no, there it is.<br> The silver Victorian inkwell.<br> - How can you think about things?!<br> - Thank God. There's the inkwell.<br> Silver jaguar.<br> - Why?<br> - Slashed. Throats slashed.<br> There's the Degas.<br> Go to bed at night happy and then<br> murdered. Would we have woken up?<br> We're alive.<br> And that's that.<br> Well, it's not.<br> I think we could tell if someone was here.<br> - We didn't all night.<br> - (phone rings)<br> Oh! No, don't.<br> Don't pick up that phone. It's him!<br> - Hello?<br> - Flanders?<br> Geoffrey!<br> I've been thinking. Those Japs<br> really want the Czanne. They'll pay.<br> You can depend on me<br> for an additional overcall of 250.<br> And I was thinking, for South Africa,<br> what about a black American film festival?<br> With this Spike Lee you have now.<br> And, of course, get Poitier down<br> to be the president of the jury.<br> And I know Cosby.<br> And I love this Eddie Murphy.<br> And my wife, she went fishing with Diana<br> Ross and her new Norwegian husband.<br> And they must have some new blacks.<br> It sounds a wonderful idea.<br> I'll call Poitier at the Sherry.<br> - No! No, no. We'll call.<br> - They're calling my plane.<br> - And again, last night...<br> - No need to thank.<br> - See you shortly.<br> - The banks?<br> My lawyers.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Exactly.<br> - Safe trip.<br> - Thank you.<br> (Ouisa) And here we are.<br> Safe.<br> - Yoo-hoo! Do we have a story to tell you?<br> - Whoo!<br> - Do we have a story to tell you?!<br> - Let us tell you our story first.<br> - When did your story happen?<br> - Saturday night.<br> We win! 0ur story happened<br> Friday night, so we go first.<br> are at Harvard together.<br> - We're going to be in the movies.<br> - We are going to be in the movie of Cats.<br> Yes!<br> You tell your story first.<br> Friday night we were home.<br> The door bell rang.<br> I am not impressed, but it is the son of...<br> You got it!<br> The kid was mugged.<br> We had to go out. We left him.<br> He was so charming.<br> His father was taking the redeye.<br> He couldn't get into the hotel till 7 am.<br> He stayed with us.<br> Middle of the night,<br> somebody screamed "Burglar!"<br> We came out in the hall. Paul is chasing<br> this naked blond thief down the corridor.<br> Blond thief runs out, the alarms go off.<br> The kid saved our lives.<br> - That was no burglar.<br> - You had another house guest.<br> We feel so guilty.<br> Paul could've been killed by that intruder.<br> He was very understanding.<br> - Was anything missing from your house?<br> - No.<br> - Did you give Paul any money?<br> - $25 till his father arrived.<br> We told them our story.<br> Oh!<br> - Have you talked to your kids?<br> - Couldn't get through.<br> We could go back to our place<br> and phone them.<br> Hello. Sherry-Netherland?<br> I'd like to speak to...<br> - She gave the name.<br> - No, I'm not a fan. This is not a fan call.<br> Sidney Poitier must be registered.<br> His son is...<br> - (receptionist hangs up)<br> - Oh!<br> - Bet he's there under another name.<br> - (buzzer)<br> Try Celebrity Service.<br> Hello, Celebrity Service?<br> I'm not sure how you work.<br> Greta Garbo used "Harriet Brown".<br> - You find celebrities?<br> - They must've known she was Garbo.<br> I'd like to know how one<br> would get in touch with...<br> Oh!<br> No, I'm not a press agent. No, I'm not with<br> anyone. My husband, Flanders Kittredge...<br> - (receptionist hangs up)<br> - They do not give out information.<br> - Try the public library.<br> - Try Who's Who.<br> "To thank you for a wonderful time".<br> "Paul Poitier".<br> - A pot of jam.<br> - Pot of jam? Jesus!<br> I think we should go to the police.<br> - What are the charges?<br> - He came into our house.<br> - He told us about Catcher in the Rye.<br> - He said he was the son of Sidney Poitier.<br> - Sidney Poitier?<br> - You got it!<br> - Was he?<br> - We don't know.<br> - We gave him $50.<br> - We gave him 25.<br> - He picked up a hustler.<br> - He left.<br> - He chased the burglar out.<br> - He didn't steal anything.<br> - We looked.<br> - Top to bottom. Nothing gone.<br> - This does not seem major now...<br> - Look.<br> - We are very busy.<br> - You can't chuck us out.<br> Come up with some charges,<br> then I can do something.<br> - Yes, there is another chapter.<br> - 0ur kids came down from Harvard.<br> (arguing)<br> The details he knew -<br> how would he know about the painting?<br> Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.<br> And none of you know this fellow?<br> He has this wild quality, yet an elegance.<br> A real concern. And a real consideration.<br> (girl) Mom, you should have let him stay.<br> You should have divorced all your<br> children and just let this dreamboat stay.<br> - Plus, he sent you flowers.<br> - And jam.<br> If only we could just get in touch with<br> his father, find out if there's any truth in it.<br> Who knows Sidney Poitier?<br> We could just call him up and ask.<br> - I have a friend who does theatrical law...<br> - What friend?<br> - It's nobody.<br> - I want to know.<br> Nobody.<br> - Oh. Oh. Oh.<br> - Nobody! Nobody!<br> - I don't want to know.<br> - Larkin! This is not the time to do this!<br> Mom, Dad, please! For once! Please!<br> (arguing)<br> (woman) It's got nothing<br> to do with you, Ben.<br> Tess!<br> When you see your little sister, don't tell<br> her that Paul and the hustler used her bed.<br> You put him in that bed.<br> I'm not getting involved in any conspiracy.<br> It's not a conspiracy!<br> Hello, Alf. It's a family.<br> The imagination.<br> It's there to sort out your nightmare.<br> To show you the exit<br> from the maze of your nightmare.<br> To transform the nightmare into<br> dreams that become your bedrock.<br> If we do not listen to that voice, it dies.<br> It shrivels.<br> It vanishes.<br> The imagination is not our escape.<br> is the place we are all trying to get to.<br> (screams)<br> (phone rings)<br> - Hello?<br> - I had a call that might interest you.<br> (Flan) And a new character<br> entered our story.<br> Well, it was really quite extraordinary,<br> very unusual. I was seeing a patient...<br> Dr Fine, there's a friend<br> of your son's here. He's hurt.<br> - My God.<br> - Hi.<br> - I was mugged.<br> - Come in.<br> He was more scared than hurt.<br> A knife wound. A few bruises.<br> - I don't know how to thank you.<br> - Don't be silly.<br> My father'll be here tomorrow.<br> He's making a movie of Cats.<br> Yes.<br> And this man had been<br> a matine idol of my youth.<br> Somebody who had really forged ahead<br> and made new paths for blacks<br> just by the strength of his own talent.<br> Strangely, l'd identified with him<br> before I started medical school.<br> I mean, I'm a Jew.<br> My grandparents were killed in the war.<br> And I had this sense of self-hatred, of fear.<br> And this kid's father,<br> the bravery of his films,<br> gave me a direction, confidence.<br> Simple as that.<br> We're always paying off debts.<br> Then my beeper went off - a patient in<br> her tenth month. Her water finally broke.<br> I gave the kid my keys.<br> - Number 121.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Doug told me all about your brownstone.<br> - Is that right?<br> How you got it at a great price<br> because there'd been a murder in it,<br> and people thought it had a curse.<br> But you, sir, were a scientific man,<br> and were courageous.<br> Well, yes. Courageous.<br> Very courageous.<br> I ran off to the delivery room.<br> - Twins. Two boys.<br> - (woman) Ahh.<br> I thought of my son.<br> I dialled my boy at Dartmouth.<br> Amazingly, he was in his room.<br> Doing what, I hate to ask.<br> You've accused me of having<br> no interest in your life,<br> of not doing for your friends,<br> being a rotten father.<br> Well, this should make you very happy.<br> The son of who?<br> Dad, I never heard of him.<br> Dad, as usual, you're a real cretin.<br> You gave him the keys?<br> You gave a stranger who happens to<br> mention my name the keys to our house?!<br> Dad, sometimes it's<br> so obvious to me why Mom left.<br> I'm so embarrassed to know you!<br> You gave the keys to a stranger<br> who shows up at your office?!<br> Mom told me you beat her, and you drank<br> so much your body smelt of cheap wine.<br> Mom said sleeping with you was like<br> sleeping with a salad with bad dressing!<br> - Why did you bring me into this world?!<br> - There are two sides to every story.<br> You're an idiot! You're an idiot!<br> I went home, courageously.<br> With a policeman.<br> (? string quartet music)<br> (volume increases)<br> (door opens and closes)<br> Arrest him!<br> - Pardon?<br> - Breaking and entering!<br> - Breaking and entering?<br> - You're an impostor!<br> Fine gave me the keys to his brownstone.<br> - Isn't that so?<br> - My son doesn't know you!<br> This man gave me the keys to his house.<br> Isn't that so?<br> - Did you give him your keys?<br> - Yes, but... but under false pretences.<br> This... this fucking black kid,<br> crack addict, comes into my office...<br> l've taken this much brandy,<br> but can pour the rest back.<br> I've used the electricity listening to music,<br> but nothing's been taken from the house.<br> Excuse me.<br> I want you to arrest this fraud!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Stop him!<br> A cretin! A creep!<br> No wonder Mother left you!<br> Two sides... every story.<br> We decided to get a copy<br> of Sidney Poitier's autobiography.<br> So we go down to the Strand<br> Book Store - eight miles of books.<br> (Flan) Five Sherlock Holmeses.<br> I've found it! This Life by Sidney Poitier.<br> "Back in New York,<br> with Juanita and the children,<br> l became aware that our marriage,<br> while working on some levels,<br> was falling apart<br> in other fundamental areas".<br> Oh, there's a picture of him<br> and his four... daughters.<br> - No sons?<br> - No sons.<br> Imagine our surprise.<br> Well... shall we?<br> This kid, bulldozing his way into our lives.<br> We let him into our lives.<br> I run a foundation,<br> you're a dealer, you're a doctor.<br> You'd think we'd be satisfied.<br> Agatha Christie would ask<br> "What do we all have in common?"<br> It seems the common thread linking us all<br> is a need to be in the movie of Cats.<br> I don't want to know anything<br> about the spillover of their lives.<br> All we have in common is, our children<br> went to boarding school together.<br> - Why have we never met?<br> - His mother had custody. I lived out West.<br> After Doug graduated high school,<br> she moved West, I moved East.<br> - I think we should drop it right here.<br> - Are you afraid Ben is mixed up in this?<br> - I don't wanna know too much about him.<br> - You think Ben is hiding things from us?<br> I'm getting to the bottom of it. My son has<br> no involvements with any black frauds.<br> - Doctor, you said something about crack.<br> - No, that just leapt out. No proof.<br> Good God, no proof!<br> We'll take a vote. Do we pursue this, no<br> matter what we find out about our kids?<br> - I vote yes.<br> - Me too.<br> - I trust Doug.<br> - No.<br> Yes.<br> Listen to this last page. "We have hidden<br> too much from our modern children".<br> "When we are scared,<br> we tend not to let them know".<br> "They see the bravest, toughest, and<br> most impenetrable visage we can muster,<br> precisely at those times<br> when we are most afraid".<br> "We called it making it better for our<br> children, protecting them. From what?"<br> "The truth is what we were<br> protecting those little people from".<br> What did you do next?<br> - Went to Harvard.<br> - To enlist our children.<br> Why do you keep insisting<br> it's someone we know?<br> It's no one from our high school!<br> It's someone you went to high school<br> with, since you go to different colleges.<br> - Doug, I appreciate your coming here.<br> - Dad, spare me.<br> He knows the details of our lives.<br> Who, in your high school, has become<br> homosexual or is deep into drugs?<br> - About 15 people.<br> - I don't want to know.<br> I find it really insulting that<br> you assume it has to be a guy.<br> He could have been<br> with a girl in high school.<br> That's your problem. You're so limited.<br> - That's why I'm going to climb mountains.<br> - You're not.<br> We have not invested all this money<br> in you to scale the face of K2.<br> Is that all I am? An investment?!<br> No. Track down everyone<br> in your class - male, female, whatever.<br> Not just homosexuals, drug addicts.<br> He could be a dealer.<br> Why do you look at me when you say<br> that? You think I'm an addict? A pusher?<br> I resent the accusations.<br> No one is accusing you of anything.<br> Now, sit down!<br> I don't wanna know!<br> Nobody is accusing anyone of anything.<br> I'm asking you to do a detective search.<br> Find out from your high-school class<br> if anyone has met a black kid<br> pretending to be a movie star's son.<br> He promised you parts in Cats?<br> It wasn't just that, it was fun!<br> You went to Cats. You said it was an<br> all-time low in a lifetime of theatregoing.<br> - Film is a different medium.<br> - You said "Aeschylus didn't invent theatre<br> to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids<br> wondering who will go to kitty heaven".<br> - I don't remember saying that.<br> - That was Starlight Express.<br> Maybe he'll make a movie of that<br> and you can all be on roller skates.<br> - This is so humiliating!<br> - So pathetic!<br> - So racist.<br> - It's not racist!<br> Douglas!<br> - If I remember correctly, you loved Cats.<br> - I hated it!<br> Here is a copy of your yearbook. Get the<br> phone numbers of everyone in your class.<br> How can I contact anyone from<br> high school? I've outgrown them.<br> How can you outgrow them?<br> You graduated last year.<br> Charge the calls to my phone.<br> - Never!<br> - This is the KGB!<br> You're always on the phone. Now I ask<br> you to make calls, you become reticent?<br> This is the entire McCarthy period.<br> - I just wanna get one thing straight.<br> - Finally we hear from the peanut gallery.<br> You gave him my pink shirt? You gave<br> a complete stranger my pink shirt?!<br> That shirt was<br> a Christmas present from you!<br> I treasured that shirt! I loved that shirt!<br> My collar has grown from weightlifting.<br> You saw my arms had grown,<br> you saw my neck had grown, and you<br> bought me that shirt for my new body!<br> I loved that shirt! My first shirt for my<br> new body, and you gave that shirt away?!<br> I can't believe you!<br> I hate this life, and I hate you!<br> - You never do anything for me!<br> - You block me.<br> I'm a pathetic extension<br> of your eighth-rate personality.<br> Social Darwinism<br> pushed beyond all limits!<br> - You gave him my pink shirt!<br> - You want me to be all you weren't!<br> You said "drugs" and looked at me?!<br> Oh, God. I know the feeling.<br> When the children turn.<br> - At least we inspired them to take action.<br> - They hunted through the yearbook.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - Did you kiss him?<br> - N... Well, yeah.<br> - Oh, come on, Tess!<br> - What about that guy? Nah!<br> - No. No.<br> - No. No, no, no.<br> - Wait a minute. Trent Conway.<br> (boys) Trent Conway.<br> - Look at those beady eyes.<br> - Trent Conway. He's at MIT.<br> So I went to MIT.<br> He was there in his computer room.<br> And I just pressed him<br> and pressed him and pressed him.<br> Yes. I knew Paul.<br> I had this strapped to me.<br> What happened between you?<br> It was...<br> It was...<br> It was... a rainy night in Boston.<br> He was in a doorway.<br> I met him.<br> And I took him back to my place.<br> What's this?<br> - My address book.<br> - Damn!<br> All these names and addresses.<br> Tell me about these people.<br> This is where I wanted you to be.<br> Right here.<br> - Tell me about these people, man.<br> - I just wanna look at you.<br> Sorry!<br> - Is these all rich people?<br> - No. Hand-to-mouth. 0n a higher plateau.<br> You got to be rough<br> to be with rich people.<br> Gotta have money. You gotta be buyin'<br> 'em presents an' everything all the time.<br> Not at all. When rich people do something<br> nice for you, you give them a pot of jam.<br> That's what pots of jam is for?<br> Orange. Grapefruit. Strawberry.<br> But fancy. They have entire stores filled<br> with fancy pots of jam wrapped in cloth.<br> English or French.<br> I tell you what I'm gonna do. I pick<br> a name, you tell me everything about 'em.<br> Where they live, secrets, everything.<br> And for every name...<br> you get a piece of my clothes.<br> All right.<br> Kittredge.<br> Talbot and Woodrow.<br> Talbot, called "Tess", was anorexic,<br> and was in a hospital for a while.<br> Oh, really, now?<br> Woodrow, known as "Woody",<br> has barbells for brains.<br> (blows)<br> They parents.<br> Ouisa and Flan, for "Flanders", Kittredge.<br> Rhode lsland, I believe. Newport.<br> But not along the ocean.<br> The street behind the ocean.<br> He's an art dealer. They have a Kandinsky.<br> Kan-what-sky?<br> A Kandinsky.<br> Uh...<br> A double-sided Kandinsky.<br> I feel like Scheherazade! (laughs)<br> I don't want you to leave me, Paul.<br> I'll go through my address book<br> and I'll tell you about family after family.<br> You'll never not fit in again.<br> We'll even, uh, give you a new identity.<br> I'll make you the most sought-after<br> young man in the East.<br> And then, one day,<br> I'll come into one of these homes.<br> And you'll be there.<br> And I'll be presented to you.<br> And I'll pretend to meet you<br> for the first time.<br> And our friendship'll<br> be witnessed by my friends.<br> And our parents' friends.<br> And if it all happens under their noses...<br> they can't judge me.<br> And they can't disparage you.<br> I'll make you a guest in their houses.<br> Now ask me another name.<br> I'd like to try for the shirt.<br> That's enough for today.<br> Paul stayed with me for three months.<br> You remember little Trent Conway?<br> The kid got his address book,<br> with our names in it.<br> - Yeah. You could be next.<br> - Yes.<br> Now, this is the way you must speak.<br> Hear my accent. Hear my voice.<br> Now, you never say<br> you're going horseback riding.<br> - You say you're going riding.<br> - (grunts)<br> And don't say "couch".<br> Say "sofa".<br> And you, you say "boddill".<br> "Have a boddill o' beer".<br> It's "bottle".<br> Say "Bottle of beer".<br> Boddill o' beer.<br> Boddill o' beer.<br> Bottle of beer.<br> Boddill of beer. What?<br> Bottle of beer.<br> Bottle... of beer.<br> We went through the address book<br> letter by letter.<br> Paul vanished by the Is.<br> He took the address book with him.<br> Well... he's already<br> been in all your houses.<br> Maybe I will meet him again.<br> I sure would like to.<br> - His past? His real name?<br> - I don't know anything about him.<br> It was a rainy night in Boston.<br> He was in a doorway. That's all.<br> He took stuff from you?<br> Besides the address book?<br> He took my stereo,<br> my sport jacket, my word processor.<br> And my laser printer.<br> And my skis.<br> And my TV.<br> - Will you press charges?<br> - No.<br> It's a felony.<br> - Why do they want to find him?<br> - They say to help him.<br> If there's a crime,<br> the cops will get involved.<br> We really must keep in touch. We were<br> really good friends for a brief bit in school.<br> - Really good.<br> - Won't you press charges?<br> Oh, please.<br> Can you believe it?<br> Paul learned all that in three months.<br> Who'd have thought it? Trent Conway,<br> the Henry Higgins of our time.<br> Paul must have looked at all those names<br> in that book and said "l am Columbus".<br> "I am Magellan.<br> I will sail into this new world".<br> I read somewhere that<br> everybody on this planet<br> is separated by only six other people.<br> Six degrees of separation between us<br> and everyone else on this planet.<br> The president of the United States, a<br> gondolier in Venice, just fill in the names.<br> I find that extremely comforting<br> that we're so close,<br> but... I also find it like Chinese water<br> torture that we're so close,<br> because you have to find the right<br> six people to make the connection.<br> It's not just big names, it's anyone.<br> A native in a rainforest,<br> a Tierra del Fuegan, an Eskimo.<br> I am bound - you are bound -<br> to everyone on this planet<br> by a trail of six people.<br> It's a profound thought.<br> How Paul found us.<br> How to find the man whose son he claims<br> to be, or perhaps is. Although I doubt it.<br> How everyone is a new door<br> opening into other worlds.<br> Six degrees of separation between us<br> and everyone else on this planet.<br> But... to find the right six people.<br> - Hi, Ouisa.<br> - Hi!<br> - Still going to Rome?<br> - Tomorrow!<br> - Are you going to the Sistine Chapel?<br> - It's closed.<br> - Cleaning it.<br> - When in Rome...<br> You must know these people.<br> - Oh!<br> - Oh, wonderful.<br> I've always wanted to meet him.<br> We'll call him just as soon as we get in.<br> (Flan) Rome is always remarkable,<br> but to see the Sistine Chapel like this!<br> (Ouisa)<br> To stand at the top of the scaffolding!<br> The colours... are vibrant.<br> We went to Rome on business,<br> but, thanks to Michelangelo...<br> - I think I have a buyer for that piece.<br> - I don't think I want to sell.<br> They restored the chapel.<br> They've taken off years of smoke<br> and tourists, and now it's brand-new.<br> Staggering.<br> But what happened<br> to Sidney Poitier's son?<br> We put all of that out of our heads.<br> The package would be more lucrative<br> for you if you included that piece.<br> - I've heard so many stories.<br> - Like what?<br> - That he stole money and jewellery.<br> - No! Never!<br> Can we get down to business, please?<br> - Good day.<br> - Ah!<br> All right. I am humiliated,<br> but what the hell.<br> The day after we came back from Rome,<br> we were stepping out of a taxi from lunch.<br> and any time he does anything nice for us,<br> our doorman spit at my husband,<br> J Flanders Kittredge. He spit at him!<br> Thank you, Maurice. 0oh!<br> Darling, they don't<br> need to know every detail.<br> - I know all about your son.<br> - What about my son?<br> Not the little shit that lives here.<br> The secret son.<br> - The Negro son you deny!<br> - Negro son?<br> The son you make live in Central Park<br> while you're gallivanting!<br> - Do you have a black son?<br> - No!<br> This is how rumours<br> get started and set in cement.<br> - The girl told me everything.<br> - Who?<br> - She wants her money.<br> - Who?<br> I'm keeping her in a safe place.<br> Come, come, come.<br> The next chapter.<br> My boyfriend and l<br> took a picnic into the park.<br> So, do they have any<br> black people in Utah?<br> - Maybe two.<br> - I saw them once. Two black people.<br> The Mormons brought in two.<br> - Do you think it'll hurt me?<br> - What'll hurt you?<br> My resemblance to Liv Ullmann.<br> She won the all-state competition<br> for comedy and drama.<br> Really? My gosh!<br> The quality of mercy is not strained.<br> It droppeth like<br> the gentle rain from heaven.<br> Yeah.<br> And we study. And we wait tables.<br> Cos you have to have technique.<br> Like the painters.<br> Czanne looked for the rules behind<br> the spontaneity of lmpressionism.<br> - That's a painter?<br> - We know nothing about painting.<br> My dad loves painting.<br> He has a Kandinsky,<br> but he loves Czanne the most.<br> - He lives up there.<br> - What?<br> Yeah. Count. Six windows down.<br> John Flanders Kittredge.<br> His chums call him "Flan".<br> I was the child of Flan's hippie days.<br> His radical days.<br> He went down South as a freedom<br> marcher to register black voters.<br> - You did?<br> - No!<br> Can't you just see me marching<br> down South for freedom now?<br> Yes. Yes, I can.<br> His friends were killed.<br> He met my mother and registered her.<br> Married her in a fit of righteousness,<br> knocked her up with me,<br> and came back here and abandoned her.<br> You didn't!<br> Flan, shame.<br> He's now a fancy art dealer.<br> Won't see me.<br> The new wife, the white wife,<br> the Louisa-Kittredge-call-me-Ouisa wife,<br> the mother-of-the-new-children wife...<br> Your brothers and sisters.<br> They go to Andover and Exeter<br> and Harvard and Yale.<br> The awful thing is,<br> my father started out good.<br> My mother says "There's a good man<br> inside J Flanders Kittredge".<br> There is, darling. There is.<br> Flan thinks he's part of some sinister plot.<br> No, it's all too creepy.<br> I don't even like to talk about it.<br> He would see you if he's that good.<br> He can't forget you entirely.<br> - I call him, he hangs up.<br> - Go to his office.<br> He doesn't have one. He works there.<br> They won't even let me in the elevator.<br> - Dress up as a messenger.<br> - Say you got a masterpiece for him.<br> Say "l got the Mona Lisa in the truck".<br> I don't want to embarrass him.<br> Oh, this is so fucking tacky!<br> Do you two love each other?<br> A lot.<br> That's good.<br> - These are nice kids.<br> - Yeah. They work for a living.<br> (laughter)<br> - I hope we can meet again.<br> - Yeah. Hey, where do you live?<br> Live?<br> I'm home.<br> You don't live in the streets?<br> You guys are such assholes!<br> I mean, where would I live?<br> - You can stay with us.<br> - We just have a flat in a tenement.<br> It's over a roller disco.<br> The last of the roller discos.<br> But it's quiet by 5am,<br> and a great narrow space.<br> (girl) You have the couch. The tub is in the<br> kitchen, but there's light in the morning.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> He opened up a whole new world to us.<br> It's all anybody wants, isn't it?<br> A new world?<br> - You say... you're going riding.<br> - Riding.<br> And never say "couch". It's "sofa".<br> - Sofa.<br> - Sofa.<br> And you say "boddill".<br> It's "bottle". Bottle of beer.<br> - Boddill of beer.<br> - No. Bottle of beer.<br> - Bottle.<br> - Boddill of beer.<br> Oh. See? Bottle of beer.<br> And never be afraid of rich people.<br> You know what they love?<br> A fancy pot of jam.<br> Really. That's all.<br> Get a patron. That's what you need.<br> You shouldn't be waiting tables.<br> You're going to wake up one day, and that<br> temporary job will be your full-time life.<br> - He stayed with them for...<br> - Two or three weeks.<br> He sunk his heels in.<br> - I'm moving out of here.<br> - You can't.<br> My father answered my letter. He's giving<br> me $1,000, and that's just for starters.<br> He sold a Czanne to the Japanese<br> and made millions.<br> Now he can give me money<br> without her knowing it.<br> I knew it.<br> I'll give you the money to put on any play.<br> Agents will come. You'll be discovered.<br> And when you win 0scars, both of you,<br> you'll look in the camera and thank me.<br> - I wanna thank Paul Kittredge.<br> - Thanks, Paul.<br> (Paul laughs)<br> in Maine. He's visiting his parents.<br> My grandparents, whom l've never met.<br> He's finally gonna tell them about me.<br> Can you see the look on my parents' face<br> if a black kid showed up? "Hi, Grandma".<br> - Flan, your parents are dead.<br> - (laughter)<br> He's gonna give me money.<br> I can get my mama that beauty parlour<br> she's wanted all her life.<br> how am I gonna get to Maine?<br> The wife checks all the bills.<br> Where the hell am I going<br> to get $250 to get to Maine?<br> How long would you need it for?<br> I'll be gone a week.<br> But I could wire it back to you.<br> - We could lend it to him for a week.<br> - If something happens...<br> You're like his stepmother,<br> holding the purse strings.<br> No. We worked too hard to save that.<br> I'm sorry, Paul, we just can't.<br> Look, no problem. I understand.<br> - I'll meet you after work.<br> - Sure.<br> If your dad loves you,<br> he'll get you the ticket.<br> He does. It'll work out.<br> Hey. Posture. Stand up straight.<br> Don't slump. Attitudes of defeat.<br> The girl worked just to stay alive.<br> She was one of those armies of people<br> who come to New York filled with dreams,<br> and end up on a treadmill, working and<br> working, forgetting why they came here.<br> There must be some mistake. It says my<br> joint account. Can you see the numbers?<br> That's right. That's my name and his<br> name, my joint account! Who closed it?!<br> I was furious.<br> I can't tell you how furious I was.<br> Then I went home to my luxurious<br> penthouse. And I waited for hours.<br> - Where's the money?<br> - Hi.<br> Just let me explain.<br> Paul found some extra money of his own.<br> So he took me to the Rainbow Room.<br> He would've treated you,<br> only you had to work.<br> We rented these tuxedos. Isn't it a gas?<br> How did we get this table?<br> I know the right names to drop.<br> He's gonna give us the money back. And<br> then I'm takin' you to the Rainbow Room.<br> I brought you matches.<br> It's not that expensive for what you get.<br> It's not a bargain, but it's worth it.<br> Mm. Wonderful bouquet.<br> "Bouquet"?<br> The taste of wine. Always remember,<br> the wine from the even-numbered years<br> is superior to the wine from<br> the odd-numbered years.<br> - Cheers. Skol. Prosit.<br> - Mud in your eye.<br> You're just about the greatest.<br> - You wanna dance?<br> - Elizabeth hasn't seen anything like here.<br> I wish she was...<br> Who do we dance with?<br> We're guys.<br> Every moment in life<br> is a learning experience.<br> Or what good is it? Right?<br> - Right?<br> - Yes.<br> Then let this bunch of jerks see class.<br> I swear, nothin' like this<br> ever happened in Utah.<br> Nothin' like that must have ever happened<br> there cos they asked us to leave.<br> It was so funny!<br> (laughter)<br> Around the park, sir!<br> We don't have any money.<br> Amigo, when will you learn? Money is<br> the one commodity you can always get.<br> (Paul howls)<br> Hyah!<br> I'm gonna have to explain to Elizabeth<br> about the money. She gets so nervous.<br> Hey, Paul, come on. Stop that.<br> I was wondering if I could fuck you.<br> I don't do things like that.<br> That's what makes it so nice.<br> You don't.<br> And he did.<br> And it was fantastic.<br> We came here for experience, right?<br> We can use this, right?<br> You're a fool!<br> Your father is right! You are a fool!<br> We came here for experience. My father<br> is not right. I can't have him be right.<br> - It's gon...<br> - Don't touch me.<br> (driver) Hey! Hey!<br> Hey! Come back here!<br> Hey!<br> Argh!<br> Paul!<br> Paul!<br> Look at me.<br> Elizabeth.<br> I didn't come here to do this, or to lose<br> that, or to be this, or to do this to you.<br> Not to you.<br> Look at me.<br> I couldn't look at him. Spent the night<br> thinking about having no money.<br> About Paul and his father.<br> So, this morning...<br> Sir?<br> Sir? I need to get up to see<br> some people named Kittredge.<br> Are they expecting you?<br> Kittredge has a black son he makes<br> live in the park who took money from me.<br> - Mr Kittredge has what?!<br> - His son owes me money!<br> You have to call<br> and write them a letter. Yes?<br> "Quality of mercy is not strained".<br> Well, fuck you, quality of mercy!<br> Hey. It's trouble with Mr Kittredge's Negro<br> son. I take care of it. Don't worry.<br> All over the building that I had abandoned<br> some mistake of my past in Central Park.<br> - But it's too fantastic.<br> - It was so embarrassing.<br> - That's horrible.<br> - It wasn't so embarrassing.<br> I bet Flan loves to be outraged.<br> - I do not!<br> - You do too!<br> - Flan loves getting into high dudgeon.<br> - And look at his cheeks turn all rosy.<br> Dudgeon becomes him.<br> To high dudgeon.<br> Now... can we get down to business?<br> Do we have a story for you? We were<br> at the roller disco two clients opened.<br> I hadn't skated in<br> l hate to tell you how many years.<br> We came outside giddy and reeling.<br> And you wouldn't believe what we saw.<br> - The blood hadn't yet reached the gutter.<br> - It was oozing slowly towards the kerb.<br> The body must have just<br> landed there in a clump.<br> The boy had just jumped from above.<br> He could have landed on us.<br> (woman) We just missed it by minutes.<br> Rick! Oh, my God!<br> Rick! Rick!<br> - She'll press charges.<br> - I want Paul dead.<br> Rick's dead.<br> You bet your life I'll press charges.<br> We're very sorry.<br> Is there anything we can do to help?<br> That Paul's a menace. We could<br> have been killed. Throats slashed.<br> He wasn't going to kill us.<br> We haven't seen him since that night.<br> - Find him. We might have a case.<br> - Find him?<br> - How do we find him?<br> - We could tell the papers. Call The Times.<br> - 0oh, let me. I have friends at The Times.<br> - I don't wanna know.<br> - They'll publish it.<br> - Someone will see it.<br> - And turn him in.<br> - We'll find him.<br> Six degrees.<br> "Who says New Yorkers<br> don't have a heart?"<br> "Smart, sophisticated, tough New Yorkers,<br> such as the J Flanders Kittredges,<br> who opened their homes and pocketbooks<br> to a young man, learned yesterday<br> they had been boondoggled by<br> a confidence man now wanted by police".<br> - Did you see the piece in The Times?<br> - We were in Squaw Valley.<br> We came off very well.<br> I forgot to mention your foundation.<br> You could wallpaper the Empire State<br> Building with the copies Flan had made.<br> - Come to dinner with us after.<br> - Can't.<br> - Work.<br> - Auction.<br> - Matisse.<br> - 0oh!<br> Oh, no. Matisse on an off day. But our<br> people are prepared to go to well over...<br> - Don't tell all the family secrets.<br> - Well over $12,000,000!<br> - 0ut of which you will keep?<br> - Not much in these days.<br> - Oh, boy. Bring back the '80s.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> We'll have to give most of it away. But<br> it gives us credibility in this new market.<br> It's all outta whack.<br> Everything's up, everything's down.<br> - Did you ever hear from Poitier's son?<br> - No.<br> Did you ever hear from the boy?<br> - Oh, we're here to honour your guest.<br> - But I keep hearing about this story.<br> I heard about it last week in Southampton.<br> - It's amazing.<br> - No, really. To get the UN to finally...<br> - She can't save the world every day.<br> - (all laugh)<br> This is my supper,<br> and I command you to sing.<br> - This is lunch.<br> - What happened?<br> There is one last chapter,<br> which happened the other night.<br> Ouisa, may I?<br> ? The Matisse will be mine<br> for an hour or so<br> ? Then, regrettably, it has to go<br> - (Tess) So, what are you wearing?<br> - I'm totally dolled up. The blue satin.<br> Darling, I have to tell you.<br> A sign I saw today -<br> "Cruelty-free cosmetics". A store<br> was selling cruelty-free cosmetics.<br> That is a beautiful thing.<br> Do you realise the agony companies put<br> rabbits through just to test eye shadow?<br> Oh, darling, I know that.<br> I was referring to the phrase -<br> "cruelty-free cosmetics".<br> Should eliminate<br> all traces of time, cellulite...<br> Mother, I'm getting married.<br> You were going to Afghanistan.<br> I'm going to get married,<br> and then I'm going to Afghanistan.<br> You're not getting married.<br> Immediately so negative.<br> I know everyone you know,<br> and you're not marrying any of them.<br> The arrogance that you assume<br> you know everyone I know!<br> The way that you say that!<br> "I know everyone you know".<br> Unless you met them in the last two days.<br> - (phone rings)<br> - Wait. Hold on.<br> Nobody ever calls on<br> that number. Mother!<br> Hello?<br> (Paul) Hello?<br> Paul?<br> I saw the story in the paper.<br> I didn't know he killed himself.<br> He gave me that money. I didn't steal it.<br> I'll put you on hold. I'm talking to my child.<br> Put me on hold and you'll<br> never hear from me again.<br> Yes...<br> - Mother, can I t...?<br> - (dialling tone)<br> You have to turn yourself in.<br> The boy committed suicide.<br> The girl is pressing charges.<br> You stole that money.<br> Turn yourself in. Make it easy on yourself.<br> They're gonna get you.<br> Learn when you're trapped.<br> You have such promise. You need help.<br> - Would you help me?<br> - What do you want me to do?<br> Stay with you.<br> - That is impossible!<br> - Why?<br> My husband feels you betrayed him.<br> - Do you?<br> - You're a lunatic!<br> Picking up that dreck off the street.<br> Are you suicidal? Do you have AIDS?<br> Are you infected?<br> I don't have it. It's a miracle, but I don't.<br> Do you feel I betrayed you? If you do,<br> l will hang up and never bother you again.<br> Where have you been?<br> Travelling.<br> Are you in trouble? I mean, more trouble.<br> No. I only visited you.<br> I didn't like the first people so much.<br> They just went out and left me alone.<br> I didn't like the doctor.<br> He was too eager to please.<br> And he just left me alone.<br> But you - you and your husband -<br> we all stayed together.<br> - What did you want from us?<br> - Everlasting friendship.<br> Nobody has that.<br> - You do.<br> - What do you think we are?<br> Oh. You're going to tell me secrets?<br> You're not what you appear to be?<br> You have no secrets. Trent Conway told<br> me everything your kids have told him.<br> What did our kids tell him about us?<br> I don't tell that. Save that for blackmail.<br> - Perhaps l'd better hang up.<br> - No!<br> I went to a museum.<br> I like Toulouse-Lautrec.<br> As well you should.<br> I read the Andy Warhol diaries.<br> I see you're becoming an aesthete.<br> - Are you laughing at me?<br> - No. I read them too.<br> I've read "The Agony and the Ecstasy"<br> by lrving Stone, about Michelangelo.<br> Oh, well, you're ahead of me there.<br> Have you seen the Sistine Chapel?<br> Oh, yes.<br> I went right to the top in a rickety old<br> elevator and watched the men clean it.<br> You've been to the top<br> of the Sistine Chapel?<br> Stood right under the hand of God<br> touching the hand of man.<br> Batti! Batti!<br> Oh!<br> "Hit it! Hit it! It's only a fresco".<br> Hit!<br> So I did. I slapped God's hand.<br> You... you slapped God's hand?<br> Do you know what they clean it with?<br> All this modern technology.<br> - Q-Tips and water.<br> - No!<br> Clean away the years of soot,<br> grime, paint-overs.<br> Q-Tips and water, changing<br> the history of Western art. Vivid colour.<br> - Take me to see it.<br> - Take you to see it?<br> - They think you murdered someone.<br> - Can you give me a hand with these?<br> - (whispers) Paul.<br> - Paul?<br> - I'll call that detective.<br> - (phone rings)<br> Who's that? Hello?<br> - Dad! We were cut off.<br> - Oh, Tess, hi.<br> - I'm getting married!<br> - Call back.<br> I'm getting married<br> and going to Afghanistan!<br> - I can't talk about this...<br> - I am gonna ruin my life and get married.<br> Throw away everything you want me<br> to be. It's the only way to hurt you!<br> - (hangs up)<br> - Jesus.<br> - (phone rings)<br> - Yeah?<br> - I have that kid on the line.<br> - Find out where he is.<br> Find out where he is.<br> Um, look, why don't you come here?<br> Where are you?<br> You'll have the cops waiting.<br> - Tell him he has to trust us.<br> - You have to trust us!<br> - Why?<br> - Cos we like you!<br> - We like him? Where is he?<br> - Who's there?<br> It's, um...<br> - It's Flan!<br> - Oh, God.<br> Are you in tonight?<br> I could come and make a feast for you.<br> - No, we're going out tonight.<br> - Are you crazy?!<br> Tell a crook we're going out,<br> the house is empty?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Sotheby's.<br> - And the key is under the mat.<br> - Hi! Can I come to Sotheby's?<br> - Shoot! I've lost the detective.<br> - Paul says hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Sotheby's.<br> - Wonderful. I'll come.<br> - No. You can't.<br> - Why? I was helpful last time.<br> - You were helpful about the Czanne.<br> - Really? You know...<br> - You impressed Geoffrey. Where are you?<br> I was thinking maybe that's what<br> l should do, is what you do, in art,<br> but making money out of art, meeting<br> people, and not working in an office.<br> You're just seeing the glamorous side.<br> There's a whole grotty side that...<br> l could easily learn the grotty.<br> You have to have art history,<br> language, economics.<br> I'm fast. I could do it.<br> Do your kids want to?<br> It's not that. It's not a profession<br> you hand down from gen...<br> What am I doing talking<br> career counselling to you?!<br> You embarrassed me. You stole money.<br> There's a warrant for your arrest.<br> - Goddammit!<br> - No, don't!<br> - I can't believe he sucked me in again.<br> - You made him hang up.<br> - I'm here.<br> - You are?<br> Who are you? What's your real name?<br> If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.<br> That night was<br> the happiest night I ever had.<br> That was the happiest night he ever had.<br> Oh, please. I'm not a bullshitter,<br> but never bullshit a bullshitter.<br> Now, get rid of him, Ouisa.<br> You look great, dear. Tonight's<br> big business. Get him off the phone.<br> Why?<br> You let me use all the parts<br> of myself that night.<br> That was magical, that Salinger stuff.<br> Graduation speech<br> at Groton two years ago.<br> Your cooking?<br> Did you see Donald Barthelme's obituary?<br> He said that collage was<br> the art form of the 20th century.<br> Everything is somebody else's.<br> Not your children. Not your life.<br> No.<br> You got me there. That is mine.<br> That is nobody else's.<br> You don't sound happy.<br> There is so much you don't know.<br> You are so smart.<br> - And so stupid.<br> - Don't you ever say I'm stupid!<br> Have some flexibility. You're stupid<br> not to realise what you could be.<br> - What could I be?<br> - So much.<br> - With you behind me.<br> - You liked that night?<br> I've thought since<br> that you were laughing at us.<br> No!<br> You picked up that awful thing<br> to show us your contempt.<br> I was so happy I wanted to add sex to it.<br> Don't you do that?<br> No.<br> - I'll tell you my name.<br> - Please.<br> It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge.<br> It's a hyphenated name.<br> Paul...<br> listen to me.<br> You need help. Go to the police. You'll be<br> over it all the sooner. You can start...<br> - Start what?<br> - Your life.<br> Will you help me?<br> I will help you. But first, you have<br> to go to the police, you have to go to jail.<br> And will you send me books and Polaroids<br> of you and cassettes and letters?<br> - Yes.<br> - Will you visit me?<br> I will visit you.<br> And wear your best clothes<br> and knock 'em dead.<br> I'll knock 'em dead. You have to be<br> careful in prison. Use condoms.<br> I won't have sex in prison.<br> I only have sex when I'm happy.<br> - Go to the police.<br> - Will you take me?<br> I'll give you the name<br> of the detective to see.<br> I'll be treated with care if you come. If they<br> don't know you're special, they kill you.<br> I don't think they kill you.<br> Mrs Louisa Kittredge, I am black.<br> I... will deliver you to them,<br> with kindness and affection.<br> I'll plead guilty and go to prison<br> and serve a few months.<br> - A few months, tops.<br> - And when I get out, I'll work for you.<br> - No, we'll work all that out.<br> - No, no, no, no. I want to know now.<br> - You'll work for us.<br> - Learn the trade, not just the grotty part.<br> - Top to bottom.<br> - And live with you.<br> - No.<br> - Why? Your kids are away.<br> - You should have your own place.<br> - Will you help me find a place?<br> We'll help you find a place.<br> - I have no furniture.<br> - We'll help you out.<br> I made a list of things I liked at<br> the museum. Philadelphia Chippendale.<br> Believe it or not, we have two<br> Philadelphia Chippendale chairs.<br> I'd rather have one nice piece<br> than a room full of junk.<br> (laughs)<br> Quality always.<br> You'll have all that.<br> Philadelphia Chippendale!<br> And all I have to do is go to the police.<br> Make it all history.<br> Put it behind you.<br> - Tonight.<br> - Oh. No, it can't be tonight.<br> I'll take you tomorrow. I have to have<br> drinks before the auction tonight.<br> - Japanese?<br> - Germans.<br> You are just like my father.<br> - Which father?<br> - Sidney!<br> Paul...<br> he's not your father.<br> And Flanders...<br> is not your father.<br> Ouisa, for Christ's sakes!<br> Are you still on the phone?<br> We have drinks with the Japanese...<br> Is it still that kid? Get him out of our lives!<br> Get him off the phone or I'll rip<br> the fucking line out of the wall!<br> Paul?<br> I made a mistake. It is not the Germans.<br> We'll come and get you. Where are you?<br> We'll take you to the police.<br> They'll treat you with dignity.<br> Um...<br> I'm at the corner of 6th Avenue<br> and 4th Street.<br> But I'll meet you at<br> the Waverly movie theatre.<br> - We'll be there in half an hour.<br> - I'll give you 15 minutes' grace time.<br> We'll be there.<br> Paul...<br> We love you.<br> Ouisa.<br> I love you, Ouisa Kittredge.<br> Hey.<br> Bring a pink shirt?<br> We'll have a wonderful life.<br> We can skip the schmoozing, take the boy<br> to the police, and be at Sotheby's by nine.<br> Sure.<br> But we hadn't counted on... traffic.<br> (Flan) Traffic.<br> (Ouisa) Traffic.<br> We'd promised Paul<br> we would take him to the police.<br> (Flan) I called our new best friend,<br> the detective.<br> Paul! 0fficer, please! Let us go with him!<br> We promised we would go with him!<br> - Paul? Paul?<br> - No, Ouisa.<br> The Kandinsky is painted on both sides!<br> - There's nothing more you could do.<br> - (Flan) I didn't think so, no.<br> The next day, Ouisa went to the precinct.<br> Detective Marino, please.<br> - He's transferred.<br> - Since yesterday?<br> He's transferred.<br> This is about an arrest that was made<br> yesterday at the Waverly movie theatre.<br> Hold on.<br> This precinct didn't go<br> to the Waverly theatre.<br> - I didn't imagine it.<br> - I'm not sayin' you did.<br> - Perhaps you can tell me which precinct...<br> - Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.<br> The name?<br> Um...<br> Poitier. Or Kittredge.<br> Uh...<br> - Are you family?<br> - Not exactly.<br> The detective told me that I could go with<br> the young man when he was arraigned,<br> so I could tell them that he was... special...<br> We have no record of it. Some other<br> precinct must have made the arrest.<br> It sounds like your special friend<br> was wanted for somethin' else.<br> Like what?<br> Lady, how can I help you?<br> You don't even know your friend's name.<br> Six degrees.<br> We weren't family.<br> We didn't know Paul's name.<br> I went to the district attorney's office.<br> We weren't family.<br> We didn't know Paul's name.<br> I called the criminal courts.<br> I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name.<br> I read today that a young man<br> committed suicide in Rikers lsland prison,<br> and tied a shirt around his neck<br> and hanged himself.<br> Was it the pink shirt?<br> A burst of colour. Pink shirt.<br> Was it Paul? We never did<br> find out who he was.<br> I'm sure it wasn't him.<br> - Yes, I agree.<br> - Isn't it amazing?<br> We haven't seen the last of him,<br> believe me. He'll be back. He'll find a way.<br> The imagination... Oh!<br> - Why does it mean so much to you?<br> - He wanted to be us.<br> Everything we are in the world.<br> This paltry thing, our life, he wanted it.<br> He stabbed himself to get into our lives.<br> He envied us.<br> We're not enough to be envied.<br> Like the papers said, we do have hearts.<br> Having a heart is not the point.<br> We were hardly taken in.<br> We believed him for a few hours.<br> He did more for us in a few hours<br> than our children ever did.<br> And he wanted to be your child.<br> Don't let that go.<br> He sat out in that park and said<br> "That man is my father".<br> He's in trouble, and we don't<br> know how to help him.<br> Help him? My God! We could<br> have been killed. Throats slashed.<br> You were attracted to him.<br> Oh, please. Cut me out<br> of that pathology right now.<br> Attracted by his youth, his talent,<br> and the embarrassing prospect<br> of being in the movie of Cats.<br> Well... that, yes. Yes.<br> Did you put that in your Times piece?<br> And we turn him into an anecdote<br> to dine out on, like we're doing right now!<br> But it was an experience.<br> I will not turn him into an anecdote.<br> How do we keep what happens to us?<br> How do we fit it into life<br> without turning it into an anecdote?<br> With no teeth, and a punch line<br> you'll mouth over and over for years.<br> "Oh, that reminds me of that impostor".<br> "Oh, tell the one about that boy".<br> And we become these human jukeboxes,<br> spilling out these anecdotes.<br> But it was an experience.<br> How do we keep the experience?<br> That's why I love paintings.<br> Czanne, the problems he brought up then<br> are the problems painters still deal with.<br> Colour. Structure.<br> Those are problems.<br> There is colour in my life,<br> but I'm not aware of any structure.<br> What are you saying, darling?<br> Czanne would leave<br> blank spaces in his canvases<br> if he couldn't account<br> for the brush stroke...<br> couldn't... give a reason for the colour.<br> Then I am a collage<br> of unaccounted-for brush strokes.<br> I... am all...<br> random.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Ouisa!<br> - Do sit down!<br> - Excuse me, please.<br> Ouisa!<br> What kind of behaviour is this?<br> God, Flan, how much of your life<br> can you account for?<br> Are you drunk? What's wrong with you?<br> Don't you realise how important she is?<br> Why are you unhappy? The Czanne<br> sale went through, and the Matisse.<br> We're rich - enough.<br> Next month there's a Bonnard.<br> These are the times I could take a knife<br> and dig out your heart. How much of...<br> ...my life can I account for?! All of it!<br> I am a gambler.<br> We're a terrible match.<br> (Paul) The Kandinsky.<br> The Kandinsky's painted on two sides.<br> (workman) Batti! Batti!<br> Tanto siamo al fresco. Hit it!<br>
