                        - Yes?<br> - Andrew Wyke?<br> That's right.<br> I'm Milo Tindle.<br> Oh, yes, good.<br> Glad to meet you.<br> You got the train to Charlebury,<br> did you?<br> - I drove.<br> - Oh, you drove?<br> That's my car.<br> Oh, the little one?<br> - Not the big one.<br> - No, the big one's mine.<br> What do you think of it?<br> - Very handsome.<br> - Yeah.<br> It is, isn't it?<br> Come in.<br> I was watching a video<br> of one of my books on television.<br> Like the house?<br> Extraordinary.<br> You know who designed it,<br> who the interior decorator was?<br> Yes, your wife.<br> You knew?<br> Yes, I knew.<br> I'll show you around later.<br> Have a drink. I'm drinking vodka.<br> - Scotch, please.<br> - Scotch.<br> Milo, what an interesting name.<br> You're a foreigner, I take it?<br> My father's Italian.<br> Milo sounds Hungarian.<br> Does it?<br> Here's your Scotch.<br> Cheers.<br> Cheers.<br> You sure your father<br> isn't Hungarian?<br> Well, if he is,<br> he's kept it a dead secret for years.<br> - And your mother?<br> - English.<br> So you're a kind of half-breed?<br> Sit down.<br> - Thanks for agreeing to see me.<br> - Not at all.<br> I didn't know you wrote plays<br> for television.<br> I don't. I write crime novels.<br> You must know that.<br> I had heard.<br> But sometimes they're adapted<br> for television by other people.<br> You know what the word<br> adapted means, I take it?<br> Adapted?<br> They may not have such a word<br> in Italian.<br> - I speak English.<br> - Good.<br> Come and have a look<br> at my special book room.<br> These are all my novels.<br> You've read them, I suppose?<br> Afraid not.<br> Good God, no?<br> What about this one?<br> - Rat in a Trap?<br> - No.<br> - The Obelisk?<br> - No.<br> - Blackout?<br> - No.<br> - Dead Fish?<br> - Afraid not.<br> God, you're one in a million.<br> - Am I?<br> - Oh, absolu... I'm very popular.<br> You see this shelf?<br> Translations.<br> French, Dutch, German.<br> You speak Dutch yourself, do you?<br> Yes, how did you know?<br> I have a Dutch uncle.<br> Can't see any Italian translations.<br> No, they're a funny lot, the Italians.<br> Culture isn't really their thing.<br> Their salami's good, though.<br> - Oh, is it?<br> - Italian salami? Best in the world.<br> Did you bring any with you?<br> - No, I left it at home.<br> - Oh, shame.<br> We're gonna have it<br> for supper tonight.<br> With a couple of bottles<br> of Valpolicella.<br> - We?<br> - Maggie and me.<br> Your glass is empty.<br> What were you drinking, vodka?<br> - Scotch.<br> - Scotch.<br> I want to come to the point.<br> Point? What point?<br> Are you gonna give Maggie<br> a divorce?<br> And if not, why not?<br> Yeah, yes, yes, we'll come to that.<br> She thinks<br> you're being unreasonable.<br> So do I.<br> She's never coming back to you,<br> so why not just give her the divorce?<br> It'll do her good to wait for five years.<br> Good for her character.<br> You're going to make her wait<br> five years?<br> - That's the law. The law of the land.<br> - But that's pure spite.<br> Anyway, we'll get back to that,<br> perhaps. Have your drink first.<br> What do you do, by the way?<br> I'm an actor.<br> Good God. Are you really?<br> I thought Maggie said<br> you were a hairdresser.<br> She must have been talking<br> about someone else.<br> You mean another friend?<br> Another friend?<br> She tends to have<br> more than one friend.<br> - Does she?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> I'm her only friend.<br> She must be lonely.<br> She's not.<br> Acting is a pretty precarious<br> profession, isn't it?<br> What are you acting in<br> at the moment?<br> I'm out of work.<br> Poor chap.<br> I drive cars now and again,<br> chauffeuring.<br> - Oh, tough life.<br> - I keep my head above water.<br> What sort of parts do you play?<br> Killers, mostly.<br> Sex maniacs, perverts.<br> But you're so charming.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Anyway, what about this divorce?<br> What's your position, exactly?<br> All in good time.<br> Come in.<br> Have a seat.<br> Make yourself comfortable.<br> I understand you're fucking my wife.<br> - That's right.<br> - Right.<br> Yes, right.<br> - So we've cleared that up.<br> - We have.<br> - I thought you might deny it.<br> - Why would I deny it?<br> - Well, she is my wife.<br> - Yes, but she's fucking me.<br> Oh, she's fucking you too?<br> Well, I'll be buggered.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Yes, it's mutual.<br> - You take turns?<br> - We fuck each other.<br> - That's what people do.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I follow.<br> - We're in love.<br> - You're in love?<br> That's right.<br> Let me top you up.<br> I heard a rumor<br> that you wanted to marry her.<br> - That can't be true, can it?<br> - Why not?<br> In this day and age,<br> is marriage absolutely necessary?<br> Isn't it a bit old hat?<br> - Is it?<br> - It's a mug's game.<br> I wouldn't go near it if I were you.<br> You can't marry her.<br> You can't marry her<br> because she's married to me.<br> Unless I divorce her, of course.<br> - And are you?<br> - Am I what?<br> Going to divorce her?<br> Are you really gonna<br> make her wait five years?<br> - She wants to know.<br> - To be honest, I can't wait.<br> But there are one or two things<br> I'd like to clear up first.<br> For example, I've never heard<br> of an Italian called Tindle.<br> My father's name is Tindolini.<br> Now, that's lovely.<br> That's like a little bell.<br> Why don't you go back to Tindolini?<br> It suits you.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yes.<br> So if and when you marry Maggie,<br> she'll be Maggie Tindolini.<br> Do you get a kick out of that?<br> What name do you act under?<br> Tindle or Tindolini?<br> - Tindle.<br> - Why have I never heard of you?<br> You will before long.<br> - Really?<br> - In spades.<br> - That sounds threatening.<br> - Does it?<br> Doesn't it?<br> Why don't we get down<br> to brass tacks?<br> Brass tacks, yes. Why not?<br> This is the way I see it.<br> Come upstairs.<br> I want to show you something.<br> Are you all right in elevators?<br> It won't make you sick<br> or anything, will it?<br> This is our bedroom.<br> And this is my wife's dressing room.<br> She left a few dresses.<br> Couldn't be bothered to pick them up.<br> They're worth thousands.<br> Thousands.<br> This leather coat alone<br> is worth 5000 quid.<br> So you see, the thing is this.<br> Sit down.<br> The thing is this,<br> my wife spends money like water.<br> So if you're not careful,<br> she'll eat you out of house and home.<br> She was born to luxury, you know.<br> Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps.<br> What are you?<br> Out-of-work actor, part-time chauffeur.<br> You're out of your depth, old boy.<br> You're on a hiding to nothing.<br> If you think you're broke now...<br> ...you'll be 10 times broker<br> by the time she's finished with you.<br> She'll have your guts for garters.<br> - She's in love with me.<br> - Oh, never trust in love, chum.<br> Love will kick you up the arse<br> as soon as look at you.<br> One minute, it's love,<br> That's your own experience, is it?<br> Oh, no, no, no, that's observation.<br> Don't forget, I'm a novelist.<br> I observe people.<br> What I'm getting at is you won't<br> be able to give her what she wants.<br> So she's gonna leave you,<br> come back to me.<br> I don't want her near me.<br> That's the last thing I want.<br> I've had her up to here.<br> Anyway, I've got this lovely mistress.<br> She runs a sauna in Swindon.<br> She's my girl.<br> So you see,<br> I want Maggie to stay with you.<br> I want you two<br> to be together forever.<br> But unless you listen to me...<br> ...the whole thing<br> will be a fucking disaster...<br> ...with catastrophic consequences<br> all round.<br> But I have a solution.<br> You won't believe<br> what I'm gonna say.<br> What are you gonna say?<br> I'm all ears.<br> You know something?<br> I'm beginning to respond<br> to your charm.<br> - Get away.<br> - No, it's true.<br> - I'm really touched.<br> - You should be.<br> Tell me, I bet you didn't expect me<br> to be so intelligent.<br> So quick-witted, did you?<br> Oh, I did.<br> Quite.<br> Maggie told you, did she?<br> What's your solution?<br> It's a close fit, isn't it?<br> For two.<br> Listen, I'm going<br> to make you a proposition.<br> A few years ago,<br> I gave her some jewels.<br> Amazingly expensive.<br> I didn't give them to her, I own them.<br> They're insured in my name.<br> But I let her use them<br> on special occasions.<br> They're worth 1 million pounds.<br> They spend half the time in the bank,<br> half the time in the safe.<br> At the moment, they're here<br> in the house, in the safe.<br> And I want you to steal them.<br> - Steal them?<br> - That's right.<br> - What the hell do you mean?<br> - I want you to steal the jewels.<br> You want me to steal the jewels?<br> I don't get it.<br> It's simple. You steal the jewels,<br> sell them abroad...<br> ...and you live happily ever after<br> with Maggie.<br> I get rid of my wife<br> and I'll be like a pig in shit.<br> You can keep Maggie in the manner<br> to which she's become accustomed.<br> You want me to take part<br> in a scummy little plot...<br> ...to defraud your insurance company,<br> is that it?<br> I thought it was quite elegant.<br> What do you think I am?<br> What the fuck<br> are you actually talking about?<br> - These are real facts.<br> - This is a joke.<br> - No.<br> - It's also a trap.<br> - A trap?<br> - Yes. You think I'm a fool.<br> Well, are you?<br> - It doesn't hold up.<br> - Why not?<br> They're worth a million pounds. You'd<br> get a fraction of that from any fence.<br> I have already contacted<br> a friend of mine in Amsterdam.<br> And he will give you<br> Now, think about it.<br> Eight hundred thousand pounds...<br> ...tax-free.<br> Why would he do that?<br> When you steal the jewels,<br> you will also steal the receipts.<br> So he'll have title to the jewels<br> as well as the jewels themselves...<br> ...so that when he sells them,<br> he gets full value.<br> Got it?<br> Think about it.<br> Take your time.<br> And why would you do all this?<br> Listen, under this crooked exterior,<br> I am a simple, honest man.<br> Every word I've told you is true,<br> I swear it.<br> I want to get rid of my wife,<br> but I want it to be solid, permanent.<br> I don't want her on my back.<br> I want her to stay on your back.<br> This is a frame-up.<br> - A frame-up?<br> - Yes.<br> You want to destroy me.<br> You want to see me in jail.<br> You want me to do this<br> and then shop me to the police.<br> No, no, no.<br> If I shop you, then you'll shop me,<br> and then we'll both end up in jail.<br> No, I take a strictly moral position<br> on all this.<br> My wife is an adulteress.<br> Actually,<br> she should be stoned to death.<br> Anyway, it's up to you.<br> Make up your own mind.<br> You're asking me to trust you?<br> I don't give a fuck<br> if you trust me or not.<br> This is a simple proposition.<br> You have an expensive woman<br> and no money.<br> You wanna keep the woman,<br> steal the jewels.<br> Why don't you steal the jewels<br> and give them to me?<br> Don't be a bloody fool.<br> The burglary has to be right.<br> The house has to be broken into.<br> - Why don't you break into it?<br> - For chrissake, I'm in it.<br> How can I break into it? I live here.<br> Okay.<br> If I were to agree to do this,<br> would you agree to the divorce?<br> Why should I give her the divorce...<br> ...if you're both walking away<br> with 800,000 pounds?<br> She wants a legal settlement.<br> - She wants part of your estate.<br> - Greedy.<br> That's legal justice.<br> Never trust in legal justice.<br> You know what legal justice is?<br> It's farting "Annie Laurie"<br> through a keyhole.<br> Listen, 800,000 pounds...<br> ...tax-free.<br> All yours, in cash.<br> - Why don't you stop pissing around?<br> - But wait a minute.<br> You get a million<br> from the insurance.<br> Sure I do.<br> Well, all right, I'll be frank.<br> I need it. Cash flow,<br> stocks, shares going down.<br> Get me? Quid pro quo.<br> You do me a favor, I do you a favor,<br> you keep the woman.<br> Okay.<br> Let's make a deal.<br> - What deal?<br> - I break in, I steal the jewels.<br> And you agree to the divorce.<br> That's the deal. Otherwise, fuck it.<br> That's another quid pro quo.<br> But you have to shake on it.<br> All right.<br> I'll shake on it.<br> Here's my hand.<br> Okay.<br> Okay. So, what do I do?<br> You break in.<br> You see that skylight up there?<br> Well, that window there is the only one<br> that the burglar alarm doesn't touch.<br> You get in there.<br> - That's pretty high up.<br> - Well, you climb a ladder.<br> - I'm not good at heights.<br> - You can do it.<br> Honestly, I know you can.<br> - You're having me on.<br> - Oh, come on. Behave like a man.<br> A man of action.<br> You don't have to be a hairdresser<br> for the rest of your life.<br> You can be free, independent,<br> take care of the woman you love.<br> Listen...<br> Put this on.<br> I use it to communicate<br> with my gardener.<br> Lovely. Actually, it suits you.<br> This is what you do. You go outside.<br> Across the lawn, there's a shed.<br> Behind the shed, there's a ladder.<br> You take the ladder, put it up<br> against the wall of the house...<br> ...and I direct you<br> through the earphone.<br> - Are you with me?<br> - Well, yes, yes.<br> - But I'm anxious and frightened.<br> - Trust me.<br> - But I don't.<br> - Well, trust me and all will be well.<br> Just follow my advice.<br> It's got to look real.<br> We have to convince<br> the insurance people...<br> ...and the police,<br> if you see what I mean.<br> Maggie never told me<br> you were such a manipulator.<br> She told me<br> you were no good in bed.<br> But she never told me<br> you were a manipulator.<br> - She told you I was no good in bed?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> She was joking.<br> I'm wonderful in bed.<br> I must tell her.<br> - There's the shed across the lawn.<br> - Shed, yeah.<br> - There's the ladder behind the shed.<br> - The ladder?<br> The ladder.<br> Inside the shed,<br> there's a pair of gardening gloves.<br> Put them on. By the gardening gloves,<br> there's a hammer.<br> You go round the back of the house.<br> Put the ladder up against the wall<br> by the lower roof.<br> Then, carry the hammer up the ladder<br> on to the lower roof.<br> Then, you pull the ladder up<br> on to the main roof...<br> ...and break the skylight window<br> with the hammer.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You've forgotten one major item.<br> What?<br> Once I'm in,<br> how do I get down to floor level?<br> Didn't I tell you? Oh, sorry.<br> You see that small metal door<br> up there?<br> Inside, there's an electric ladder.<br> You get through the window,<br> I press a button.<br> The ladder descends.<br> - You get on and climb down.<br> - Let me see it descend.<br> - What?<br> - Let me see it come down now.<br> Sure.<br> See?

I'm a really decent guy.<br> - I believe it.<br> - She's quite right.<br> I'm a really decent guy.<br> I know you are. I know you are.<br> And that's what she often says.<br> You're... She admires your mind.<br> - She admires my mind?<br> - Yes.<br> - Your mind excites her.<br> - Sexually?<br> Very. Your mind<br> excites your wife sexually.<br> - What about my body?<br> - What about it?<br> Well, what does she say<br> about my body?<br> Do you know,<br> I don't think she's ever mentioned it.<br> You're a prick.<br> - Where does my prick come into it?<br> - I can guess where it comes in.<br> But I wasn't talking<br> about your prick.<br> - I was calling you a prick.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> But you know<br> what you are now, though?<br> What?<br> - You're a dead duck.<br> - Really?<br> This is the way<br> the story goes to the police.<br> I find you in my house,<br> you threaten me.<br> You open the safe,<br> you take the jewels.<br> You put them in your pocket.<br> I manage to grab the gun<br> while you're looking at the jewels.<br> There's a struggle.<br> The gun goes off.<br> Suddenly, I realize you're dead.<br> You're gonna shoot me.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Why?<br> I planned all this from the word go.<br> I've always longed for<br> an intimate chat with a hairdresser.<br> Especially a hairdresser<br> who is fucking my wife.<br> I'm not a hairdresser!<br> My wife is mine! She belongs to me!<br> And I'm her husband!<br> And what you've done is this.<br> You've invited yourself<br> to attend your own death.<br> Please.<br> No, don't do it.<br> Please don't shoot me.<br> Please don't shoot me, please!<br> I'll just get in my car and go, okay?<br> That's all.<br> You'll never see me again.<br> You're crazy.<br> No, you're not crazy.<br> You just got things wrong.<br> I don't want your wife. I hate women.<br> You hear me?<br> I hate women. I hate your wife!<br> You've absolutely<br> no reason to be jealous.<br> Women are not my scene.<br> I'd rather do it with a dog or a goat.<br> Or a boy I knew at school.<br> His name was Dooley.<br> I called him Dolores.<br> I hate women!<br> Honest. God's honor.<br> Do you believe in God?<br> Just shut up.<br> I'm asking the questions, not you.<br> - How long have you known him?<br> - I don't know him. I've never met him.<br> What are you? A joker?<br> Yes?<br> Andrew Wyke?<br> Yes.<br> Detective Inspector Black.<br> New Scotland Yard. Eddie Black.<br> I'd like a word with you.<br> A word?<br> That's right.<br> What about?<br> Can I come in?<br> Yes. Yes, of course.<br> Like a drink?<br> Got any beer?<br> Beer? Yes.<br> You're the writer.<br> You write crime books.<br> That's right.<br> I've read a couple.<br> Right on the button.<br> Oh, that's a great compliment.<br> How do you know so much about it?<br> What?<br> Villainy.<br> Crime. Horror.<br> Imagination.<br> Imagination.<br> Clever.<br> I do my best.<br> - Cheers.<br> - Cheers.<br> I see you got<br> a broken window up there.<br> Tropical storm the other night.<br> Bit of a hurricane, terrifying.<br> A great branch broke off a big tree...<br> ...and flew through the air<br> through the skylight...<br> ...as you can see.<br> Act of God.<br> Had it in for you, did he?<br> - Who?<br> - God.<br> Oh, yes, he's always been<br> a vicious bastard.<br> You know what God's trouble is?<br> - What?<br> - He has no father.<br> He has no family roots.<br> He's rootless.<br> Nowhere to hang his hat,<br> poor bugger. I pity him.<br> That's a very interesting<br> philosophical speculation.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Aren't you a well-known detective?<br> No.<br> Not me, mate.<br> You're thinking of another bloke.<br> Haven't I seen your picture<br> in the newspaper?<br> Do you want to know<br> my opinion of the newspapers?<br> What?<br> Journalists are a bunch<br> of prick-teasing cocksuckers.<br> No.<br> That's right.<br> I'm sorry, but isn't that<br> a contradiction in terms?<br> Is it?<br> So you're not well-known?<br> No, I'm a common-or-garden copper.<br> I just catch sex criminals, perverts...<br> ...homicidal maniacs.<br> And what do you do with them<br> when you catch them?<br> I generally cut their balls off.<br> I see.<br> So how can I help you?<br> Yes, I think you can help me.<br> I think you can.<br> How?<br> I'm looking into a disappearance.<br> Disappearance?<br> Man called Tindle. Milo Tindle.<br> Sorry, I didn't get the name.<br> What was it?<br> Tindle.<br> Tindle. Tindle...<br> What about him?<br> Do you know him?<br> Know him? Absolutely not.<br> - You mean you've never met him?<br> - Never.<br> Never even heard of him.<br> - That's funny.<br> - Why?<br> Well, he was staying<br> at the Red Lion in the village...<br> ...where he mentioned<br> to the landlord...<br> ...he was coming to see you<br> three nights ago.<br> He hasn't been seen since.<br> His bag is still in his room,<br> shaving kit, all that.<br> He was coming to see me?<br> That's right.<br> He mentioned it to the landlord?<br> Why would he mention such a thing<br> to the landlord?<br> Well, you're a famous writer<br> and you're well known in the district.<br> So how can you help me on this?<br> No one came to see me.<br> I've no idea who this man is.<br> And I know no one called Tindle.<br> You don't, eh?<br> What are you? A joker?<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean you're pretty quick<br> on your feet.<br> You should have been<br> a ballet dancer.<br> I can just see you doing pirouettes.<br> - Ever worn a pair of tights?<br> - Not me.<br> They'd suit you.<br> Nice house.<br> Thanks.<br> - Design it yourself?<br> - It's 18th-century.<br> No, no, I meant this. The inside.<br> That was my wife.<br> Oh, your wife.<br> Is she here, by the way?<br> No.<br> Popped up to London?<br> She's not here.<br> She's an interior decorator, then?<br> Something like that.<br> It's a great gift, isn't it?<br> You're a lucky man.<br> You got an ashtray?<br> I'm ready for another beer.<br> A man was passing your house<br> three nights ago.<br> He said he heard shots.<br> Passed my house?<br> How could he do that?<br> It's private property.<br> He were taking a shortcut.<br> I think he's a poacher.<br> Anyway, says he heard shots.<br> What kind of shots?<br> Gunshots.<br> - Fantasy.<br> - Really?<br> Bullshit. Codswallop.<br> Who is this man?<br> Are you sure he exists?<br> Oh, he exists, all right.<br> By the way, cheers.<br> Cheers.<br> I do want to ask you<br> one more question.<br> Ask.<br> You do know your wife's<br> living in London with another man?<br> That is my business.<br> My private life is my business.<br> Do you know the name of this man?<br> Why should I answer<br> these questions?<br> You don't have to,<br> but you'd be better off if you did.<br> I don't know the man's name.<br> I never asked.<br> So you do admit that your wife's<br> living in London with another man?<br> Yes. Yes.<br> So what?<br> Well, I can tell you the man's name.<br> It's Tindle.<br> Milo Tindle.<br> - Is it?<br> - Yeah.<br> The bloke who's disappeared.<br> The bloke who said<br> he was coming to see you.<br> We found this note in his room.<br> At the pub.<br> "I look forward to meeting you.<br> Come to the house Friday, 6:30.<br> Wyke. "<br> Is this your handwriting?<br> - It is.<br> - Do you remember writing this note?<br> How could I forget?<br> You forgot earlier.<br> You said you didn't know him.<br> You said you'd never met him.<br> I was lying.<br> Lying to the police.<br> That will get you nowhere.<br> I don't understand you,<br> mate, honest.<br> You're a clever man.<br> You write clever books.<br> But you've made a balls-up<br> of this one, haven't you?<br> Have I?<br> Tindle came to see you<br> three nights ago.<br> - I knew him as Tindolini.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - He had an Italian father.<br> - Get away.<br> A traditional<br> Italian hairdressing family.<br> - Is he a hairdresser himself?<br> - I think he is.<br> He didn't come all the way here<br> to do your hair, did he?<br> Not at all, not at all.<br> So, what did you two do<br> when you got together?<br> We played a game.<br> - A game?<br> - A game with a knife and a gun.<br> - A lethal game?<br> - No.<br> Just a bit of fun, that's all.<br> Okay, a bit of fun.<br> So he came to see you.<br> You played a game<br> with a knife and a gun.<br> Three shots were fired,<br> then he disappeared.<br> So where is he?<br> - Probably cuddling my wife.<br> - That's the one thing he's not doing.<br> - How do you know?<br> - I've seen her.<br> He was nowhere in sight.<br> No. She's an anxious woman.<br> She knew he was coming<br> to see you, you see.<br> In fact, she insisted<br> that he come to see you...<br> ...as I know you know.<br> She thinks you may have killed him.<br> She thinks you're round the bend.<br> She thinks<br> you're a very dangerous man.<br> Me? She's joking.<br> So tell me, between ourselves...<br> ...did you kill him?<br> I'll tell you exactly what I did.<br> I pretended to kill him.<br> I shot him with a blank.<br> I frightened the shit out of him.<br> Your man was right.<br> Your spy, whoever he was.<br> There were three shots.<br> The first two were real.<br> The third one was blank.<br> He was terrified.<br> When I shot him, he fainted.<br> When he came round<br> I gave him a drink, pat on the bum...<br> ...he left the house, his tail, if you<br> want to call it that, between his legs.<br> And I haven't seen him since.<br> You gave him a pat on the bum?<br> Metaphorically.<br> You gave him<br> a metaphorical pat on the bum?<br> - Sure.<br> - How did he take it?<br> - What?<br> - The pat.<br> He was fine. He told me that<br> it was game, set and match to me.<br> So this guy had a sense of humor,<br> is that what you're saying?<br> Oh, yes. He left the house<br> with a twinkle in his eye.<br> So tell me,<br> what was the point of all this?<br> Humiliation.<br> It's nice to see your wife's lover...<br> ...a shivering, frightened,<br> fucking wreck in front of you.<br> As a matter of fact, I liked him.<br> I thought he was attractive.<br> I thought we could have<br> become good friends.<br> The shortest way to a man's heart,<br> as I'm sure you know, is humiliation.<br> It binds you together.<br> You found him attractive?<br> I put myself in my wife's shoes,<br> in a manner of speaking.<br> I was trying to find out<br> what attracted her to him.<br> - And did you?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> He was really terribly sweet.<br> - I could see why she fancied him.<br> - I could see why he fancies her.<br> - Really?<br> - Found her very tasty myself.<br> - Is that so?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Sumptuous. Ready for action.<br> I mean,<br> I'm an experienced detective.<br> So guess what I detected.<br> What?<br> That she's in love<br> with her own body.<br> Makes her dizzy with excitement.<br> You detected all this<br> in five minutes?<br> Well, 35. Perhaps even 45.<br> Well, let's call it 55<br> or even a little bit longer.<br> You stayed for tea?<br> And cakes.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Must be funny for you to know...<br> ...your own wife's getting a going-over<br> from another man on a regular basis.<br> Going-over? I don't follow.<br> You don't?<br> Not a phrase I'm familiar with.<br> - Means being fucked.<br> - You mean like in sexual intercourse?<br> Yes, the old one-two.<br> In like a lion, out like a lamb.<br> I must say, you have<br> a great gift for language.<br> Did you learn it at school?<br> The hard school. Family life.<br> - But you keep cheerful.<br> - You've got it, I keep cheerful.<br> I've got an optimistic nature.<br> You got to when you're a policeman.<br> Otherwise, you'd go mad.<br> No, I'll tell you<br> what keeps me going.<br> The chase. The thrill of the hunt<br> and the sudden shafts of bright light.<br> For instance,<br> when I was talking to your wife...<br> Very attractive woman.<br> Wonderful legs.<br> She was crossing them at the time,<br> I remember.<br> She suddenly said<br> you had a murderous nature.<br> Now, that really<br> made my nose twitch.<br> Itch?<br> Twitch, mate.<br> Twitch.<br> So I'm looking at you<br> and I'm wondering...<br> ...what have you done<br> with the body?<br> Where's the body?<br> Come on, I need to know.<br> Where's the body?<br> What have you done with the body?<br> There's no body.<br> Don't fuck about!<br> Don't bullshit me.<br> I won't stand for it.<br> Where is it?<br> In the house or did you shift it?<br> There is no body!<br> Here, look at this.<br> You got holes in your walls.<br> They're bullet holes.<br> Live bullet holes.<br> I fired two live bullets<br> to set up the trick...<br> ...and one blank to complete it.<br> It was a game, I told you.<br> I played it to the hilt.<br> It's not worth playing<br> unless you play it to the hilt.<br> - The third shot was a blank?<br> - That's right.<br> - What's that?<br> - What?<br> Blood. Dried blood!<br> Some of it's not even dried.<br> It's still damp.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - That's blood, chum.<br> - Whose blood is it?<br> - It's impossible.<br> It was a game. It was a blank.<br> No, it was a game<br> with real bullets and real blood.<br> This is a carve-up.<br> Let's see what else<br> is new around here.<br> Hello, what's this?<br> We've got a shirt, jacket and trousers<br> in the back of your cupboard.<br> Very negligent of you, mate,<br> unless they're not yours.<br> No, I don't think they're yours.<br> I think they belong to Tindle.<br> You say he left the house<br> after you shot him.<br> - Yes.<br> - Naked?<br> I don't know how those got there.<br> So you made him strip<br> before you shot him?<br> Part of the humiliation, was it?<br> No. The thing is this.<br> It might have started as a game,<br> but it got out of hand.<br> The third shot was live!<br> It killed him. So where's the body?<br> I didn't kill him! He's alive!<br> Bollocks. You're a joker, all right.<br> A real joker.<br> Come on, we're off to the station.<br> - There's something very wrong here.<br> - Hey, dead right.<br> I'll tell you what you are.<br> You're fucked.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Don't struggle, chum.<br> I'll have you for breakfast.<br> There's something wrong here.<br> You're up shit creek, Wyke.<br> You're up shit creek without a paddle.<br> Look at you. All aquiver.<br> Who's the dead duck?<br> Jesus Christ.<br> You're the dead duck.<br> I just sucked you in<br> and blew you out in little bubbles.<br> - It's you.<br> - It's me, all right.<br> You bastard. You stinking bastard.<br> Just a little game, Andrew.<br> - Just a little game.<br> - You shit.<br> - I thought it might amuse you.<br> - You're a total shit.<br> I know I am.<br> - But you're also a genius.<br> - I know that too.<br> When did you do this?<br> The clothes in the wardrobe?<br> - The blood?<br> - The blood belongs to a pig's liver.<br> But when did you do it?<br> How did you do it?<br> I did it last night. I used that ladder.<br> I heard you snoring.<br> Does Maggie know about this?<br> Your detective, was it her idea?<br> - How much does she know?<br> - She knows nothing about it.<br> Entirely my own idea.<br> This is a game between us, old boy.<br> Between you and me.<br> Don't forget, I'm half Italian.<br> We go in for revenge.<br> After all, you frightened<br> the life out of me deliberately.<br> You fired two live bullets<br> into the wall...<br> ...and then you pointed<br> the gun at me.<br> And then you fired.<br> I don't like guns.<br> They kill you.<br> Okay.<br> So, what does this make the score?<br> You've had your revenge.<br> So, what do you reckon?<br> One set all?<br> No, no, you're way ahead.<br> I only teased you with my inspector,<br> gave you a few goose pimples.<br> But you frightened me to death.<br> Did you really think<br> I was going to kill you?<br> You fainted, you see.<br> It was a blank.<br> I may be three games up<br> in the second set.<br> If I had killed you...<br> ...I'd have to bury the body<br> in the garden or somewhere.<br> Too exhausting.<br> But you won the first, 6-love.<br> So we're a long way<br> from one set all.<br> By the way, I spoke to Maggie.<br> I told her all about you.<br> She loved it.<br> Loved what?<br> That I frightened the life out of you.<br> That you pissed your pants.<br> And that you actually fainted.<br> She said to me,<br> "You mean he actually fainted?"<br> I said, "Dead out,<br> he was scared shitless.<br> Went out like a light. "<br> She laughed so much,<br> I thought she was gonna burst.<br> Oh, incidentally,<br> she's coming back to me.<br> Oh, is she?<br> Yes, that's right.<br> You know what she said about you?<br> What?<br> She said:<br> "Faint heart never won fair lady. "<br> Is that a fact?<br> Yeah.<br> Listen, I want to<br> show you something.<br> Go into your study and sit down.<br> Go into my study?<br> And sit down.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - It's late at night.<br> You're reading a book under a lamp.<br> Read something.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Read a book.<br> It's late at night.<br> You're reading a book.<br> You hear something. You look up.<br> It's me jumping off the ladder.<br> You see me with this gun.<br> You're caught like a rat in a trap.<br> You stare at the gun, you're paralyzed.<br> I've come for the jewels.<br> - Where is the safe?<br> - What jewels?<br> The jewels. Where's the safe?<br> - You know where it is.<br> - I don't.<br> - You don't?<br> - Don't fuck me about, I mean it.<br> Get up.<br> You think this gun isn't real?<br> Where is it?<br> - Upstairs.<br> - Well, let's go upstairs.<br> Get up these stairs<br> or I'll ram this gun right up your ass.<br> - The safe is behind the fish tank.<br> - How am I gonna get to it?<br> Well, you press the button<br> and the button moves the tank.<br> Then press it.<br> It's not working. It's out of ord...<br> Are you a maniac? You're crazy.<br> - Open it.<br> - I changed the combination yesterday.<br> - What is it?<br> - I forgot. I can't remember.<br> - Remember.<br> - It's the truth. I can't remember.<br> Remember!<br> What are you doing?<br> What are you gonna do?<br> I've broken into your house because<br> I know you have jewels in a safe.<br> I have inside information.<br> I want them.<br> Remember the combination<br> and open it.<br> It was a blank.<br> The next one's real.<br> There's a good boy.<br> So, what are you writing<br> at the moment?<br> What am I writing?<br> Yes, I'm very interested in literature.<br> Do you mind if I have a drink?<br> Sure. It's your house.<br> I'm always interested<br> in the people I rob.<br> Like I'm always interested<br> in the husbands of the wives I fuck.<br> Are you really?<br> Well, well.<br> Cheers.<br> So, what are you writing?<br> It's the story of a pathological killer.<br> - I call it The Smiling Man.<br> - Does he come to a bad end?<br> He dies during the act of love.<br> Like countless others.<br> Countless others, eh?<br> I can see you've researched<br> the subject thoroughly.<br> - What subject?<br> - Death in orgasm.<br> Isn't that a beautiful notion?<br> To die in the arms of your beloved.<br> Can you imagine<br> anything more poignant?<br> - I can't, no.<br> - No.<br> - You're a married man, aren't you?<br> - Yeah, been married 13 years.<br> It was love at first sight.<br> - Very moving.<br> - Yeah.<br> And we're still in love.<br> Like two peas in a pod.<br> Someone told me<br> your wife has a lover.<br> - She has, yeah.<br> - Do you know him?<br> No, I've never met him.<br> He's some sort of Italian.<br> Called Tandoori or something.<br> One of the Bombay Tandooris?<br> You've got it, yeah.<br> You know something? I've never met<br> an artistic burglar before.<br> That's fantastic.<br> - What's your background?<br> - Me?<br> - You.<br> - Irish. Connemara.<br> Spanish descent.<br> By way of Uganda.<br> My grandparents were slaves.<br> My mother was a dark-eyed,<br> dusky beauty.<br> - Were you breastfed?<br> - Oh, sure, like a baby.<br> Shall I tell you what I want you to do<br> with these jewels?<br> What?<br> You look so charming.<br> How do you want it?<br> Like this?<br> Or shorter?<br> How about this?<br> Or even shorter like a halter?<br> - You're hurting me.<br> - Oh, am I hurting you?<br> - Yes. Don't hurt me.<br> - Are you sensitive to pain?<br> Very. Very.<br> I wouldn't want to hurt you,<br> sweetheart.<br> You're too much fun.<br> - Am I really?<br> - Oh, yes. You're wicked.<br> I like that. Yeah.<br> Do you know something?<br> I don't think<br> these earrings really suit me.<br> You're right. Take them off.<br> I don't...<br> I don't think this bracelet<br> is really my style either.<br> But the necklace is nice.<br> I'm not totally sure.<br> Listen, you can play with these jewels<br> until the cows come home.<br> They're yours.<br> Do what you like with them.<br> But I thought you'd just stolen them.<br> No, no! It was a game!<br> It was just a game!<br> I thought it might amuse you.<br> Well...<br> Aren't you the wicked one?<br> You remember what I said?<br> You won the first set, 6-love.<br> I was 3-love up in the second.<br> Well, now it's one set all.<br> But who's going to win the third set?<br> Remains to be seen.<br> You like games, don't you?<br> Some. Not all.<br> But you like being in charge...<br> ...of the game?<br> Oh, yes. Sure.<br> I like a man who wants<br> to be in charge of things.<br> - Do you?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Listen, you've met my wife, I think.<br> I have met her. Yes.<br> - Did she say if she had a husband?<br> - Yes.<br> Yeah, she said she had a husband.<br> How did she describe him?<br> Remote. Cold.<br> Malevolent. Spiteful.<br> Arrogant. Ruthless.<br> Jealous. Paranoid.<br> Criminal tendencies.<br> Mentally unsound.<br> That's me, all right.<br> You know something?<br> I like your mind.<br> - Do you really?<br> - It excites me.<br> I like the way you go about things.<br> You mean you like my style?<br> Oh, I like your style.<br> I like it very much.<br> Look, I want to<br> make you a proposition.<br> What?<br> I want to show you something.<br> - Can't you put that gun down now?<br> - No.<br> God, you're so strong, so ruthless,<br> aren't you?<br> Yes.<br> Have you any idea<br> what my proposition is going to be?<br> - No.<br> - Are you excited?<br> I'd say intrigued.<br> I think you're going to be excited<br> very much.<br> This is the guest suite.<br> Isn't it nice? Look at the view.<br> There's a private bathroom.<br> A small fridge.<br> A bottle of Chilean Chardonnay<br> is chilling in there at this very moment.<br> This suite is uninhabited.<br> It has no occupant.<br> How would you like it?<br> Me?<br> Yes, yes.<br> I think I've come to the conclusion<br> that you're my kind of person.<br> Am I, now?<br> Well, I told you.<br> I liked your mind. It excited me.<br> I need intellectual excitement.<br> Intellectual stimulation.<br> Well, they don't grow on trees.<br> I'm a rich man.<br> What do you want to do?<br> I can subsidize anything you want.<br> You want to open a bookshop<br> in the village?<br> An art gallery?<br> Or, of course, a little theater.<br> You're a wonderful actor.<br> You could choose all the plays<br> and play all the leading parts.<br> But this would be your home.<br> And this would be your bedroom.<br> You're asking me to live here?<br> Yes, I'm asking you to stay with me.<br> Oh, we would also travel.<br> I mean, Jamaica, Swiss Alps.<br> I bet you're a wonderful skier,<br> aren't you?<br> You could ski<br> to your heart's content.<br> Swim in the blue Caribbean.<br> I'd be waiting at our table<br> with a Scotch on the rocks.<br> Or a chilled Chilean Chardonnay.<br> The world would be your oyster.<br> But what about Maggie?<br> Forget her.<br> Let her rot.<br> Stay with me.<br> You're my kind of person.<br> It's quite tempting.<br> Hello?<br> Hi.<br> It's going okay.<br> We're still talking.<br> We're on the right track.<br> It's all going okay.<br> Don't come down.<br> That would be a mistake.<br> It's all going fine.<br> I love you too.<br> I am.<br> I'm kissing you.<br> Oh, yes.<br> I can taste your mouth.<br> What the hell did she want?<br> She wants that divorce.<br> What about my proposition?<br> Well, I like the idea of Jamaica.<br> - What about Barbados?<br> - Well, and Barbados, and Antigua.<br> Yeah, it's true. There's so many<br> places I haven't seen.<br> Hollywood. Saint Petersburg.<br> The Cte d'Azur, Coney Island.<br> And I hear there's that wonderful hotel<br> in Scotland called Balmoral.<br> - That's where the queen lives.<br> - So bed and breakfast is out.<br> - It's on if you know the queen.<br> - I don't.<br> I do.<br> That's fantastic.<br> But seriously, though.<br> We could have<br> such a wonderful time together.<br> Venice? Disneyland?<br> Whatever you want.<br> Whatever you want.<br> Whoever you want.<br> I could introduce you<br> to whoever you want.<br> Kissinger? Dick Cheney?<br> Madonna? Mike Tyson?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes?<br> I must say, that as offers go...<br> ...it's quite tempting.<br> You're a naughty tempter,<br> aren't you?<br> I'm so glad you like my mind.<br> Not many people like my mind.<br> Quite a few people like my body...<br> ...but I can't think of anyone<br> who likes my mind.<br> That makes you unique.<br> But then, of course,<br> you know what they say.<br> The mind is the body.<br> Is that what they say?<br> Somebody said something like it once.<br> Bullshit, of course. Anyway...<br> Perhaps I am your sort of person.<br> Who knows?<br> But you would have<br> to be very nice to me.<br> For instance,<br> just at this moment, I need a drink.<br> You can get your own drink.<br> No, you get it for me<br> and I might be nice to you.<br> - Nice to me?<br> - That's what I said.<br> Whisky, please.<br> Can't deny, I can be<br> quite a congenial companion.<br> I really... I can't deny it.<br> I could be quite a witty companion.<br> Would you like a witty companion?<br> - Very much.<br> - I'm particularly witty in the morning.<br> Would that suit you?<br> Some people hate wit in the morning.<br> What about you?<br> I love wit in the morning.<br> Over boiled eggs?<br> Do you like eggs?<br> Absolutely.<br> I'm a dab hand in the kitchen.<br> But you have to be nice to me<br> and get me a drink when I ask for it.<br> You see?<br> You can be really sweet...<br> ...when you put your mind to it.<br> Cheers.<br> Listen, I can see what you're saying.<br> I can see why<br> you're inviting me to live with you.<br> I can see that you're lonely.<br> That you need looking after.<br> It's obvious.<br> You need someone<br> who would cater for your every whim.<br> Don't you?<br> I do.<br> Hello? Darling.<br> What?<br> Oh, is that so?<br> Are you?<br> I see.<br> Are you sure?<br> I see.<br> I got it.<br> I told you I got it. I understand.<br> Okay.<br> - Okay, I'll tell him.<br> - Tell me what?<br> - That she loves you.<br> - Is that so?<br> - What else did she say?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nothing?<br> - Nothing.<br> Listen, for chrissake,<br> make up your mind.<br> I'm offering you something special.<br> Something very special.<br> We seal it with a handshake.<br> And she's nowhere.<br> We cut her out, you understand?<br> We cut her out of our lives.<br> Don't let her dominate you.<br> Be yourself.<br> - Be independent. Be free.<br> - Like you?<br> That's right. Be free like me.<br> I've always been attracted...<br> ...to rich and powerful men.<br> Rich and powerful men<br> make all the girls quiver...<br> ...like a jelly on a plate.<br> But you're not a girl.<br> Tickles the old cobblers, money.<br> - Girls don't have cobblers.<br> - You'd be surprised.<br> But you're not a girl.<br> I may be once.<br> Back in the good old days.<br> Maybe the good old days<br> are coming back.<br> Who knows?<br> Look...<br> I'd really like to see your bed.<br> I mean, let me be quite clear.<br> This looks a very nice bed indeed.<br> But yours is bigger.<br> - Can I take another look?<br> - Sure.<br> Is this how you do it?<br> Miraculous.<br> I could really get to like this.<br> Of course,<br> this is the marriage bed, isn't it?<br> Is this where she took<br> your virginity?<br> Is this where your wife<br> deflowered you?<br> Is this where you were deflowered?<br> It's a lovely bed.<br> So bouncy.<br> I'm so touched that you've<br> offered me a place in your heart.<br> In your life.<br> I'm touched.<br> Take your hand off me.<br> Take your hand off me.<br> Fuck off. Fuck off, you big poof!<br> Jesus. I come here<br> as an innocent bystander.<br> As a totally respectable individual.<br> A humble part-time hairdresser.<br> And you try to corrupt me.<br> You try to seduce me.<br> Do you know what you are?<br> You're a menace.<br> Also, you're a cunt.<br> Well, now you really are charming.<br> - Know who's gonna love this story?<br> - What story?<br> - This one. This one.<br> - Who?<br> - Maggie.<br> - Really?<br> By the way, she asked me<br> to tell you something.<br> - What?<br> - That she's coming back to you.<br> - She's on her way.<br> - She's coming back to me?<br> - That's what she told me.<br> - I don't want her.<br> Well, you've got her. She's all yours.<br> You're welcome to her.<br> She loves your money, baby.<br> That's the nub of it.<br> I don't want her.<br> - What are you doing with that coat?<br> - I'm taking it.<br> Tell Maggie I'll be in touch.<br> I want to have a drink with her.<br> Bring her up to date.<br> How do you like me in this coat?<br> Do you fancy me?<br> Goodbye, darling.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Yes? What?<br> Goodbye, darling.<br>
