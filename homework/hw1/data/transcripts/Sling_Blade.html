                        1<br> Hey, sheriff.<br> A Mercury is a real good car.<br> That was the car<br> I was driving that day.<br> I owned a lot of cars.<br> Yeah, different kinds.<br> A lot of different kinds of cars.<br> She was standing, this girl...<br> on the side of the street<br> by this chicken stand.<br> Not the Colonel's,<br> a different chicken stand.<br> I pulled the Mercury up alongside...<br> and rolled down the window<br> by electric power.<br> And she had this leather skirt on...<br> and she had a lot of hair<br> on her arms.<br> I like that. It means a big bush,<br> which I like.<br> She says, "Are you dating?"<br> You know?<br> I said, "Sure."<br> So she gets in...<br> and we pull off into...<br> this remote location<br> comfortable for both of us.<br> She says, "How much<br> do you want to spend?"<br> I said, "Enough to see<br> your bush. I know it's big."<br> She says, "$25."<br> That's not chicken feed<br> to a working man.<br> I produce the $25,<br> she sticks it in her shoe...<br> pulls up her skirt...<br> and there is thin, crooked,<br> uncircumcised penis.<br> You can imagine I wanted my $25 back.<br> Why are you weirded out?<br> It's not San Quentin.<br> It's a nut house.<br> Most patients don't know where<br> they are. They won't hurt you.<br> It doesn't bother you we'll be facing<br> a killer in a few minutes?<br> You wanted to major in journalism.<br> They're from that newspaper deal.<br> - From the college?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I'm Jerry Woolridge.<br> - I'm Marsha Dwiggins.<br> She's Theresa Evans.<br> She's here to take pictures.<br> Y'all sit down.<br> A man named John Leggitt Hunter<br> had a filling station.<br> A good filling station business.<br> He was the type of person<br> that I'm sure you've met too...<br> who didn't deserve what he had.<br> One thing he had was...<br> this beautiful, young bride,<br> Sarah.<br> She was a Georgia peach.<br> She was more like the picture I had<br> in my mind than any woman I'd seen.<br> So I took her away<br> from John Leggitt Hunter...<br> who did not deserve her.<br> Oh, I don't know if I told you...<br> but he was a Frenchman<br> who claimed to be an Englishman.<br> Took strong nylon cord<br> to get her away from him.<br> She was a fighter and a Georgia peach.<br> There must have been a mix-up.<br> I talked to your sponsor,<br> teacher or whoever...<br> and told him no pictures.<br> This is for an article<br> or something, right?<br> Yeah, it's for the school newspaper<br> which has pictures.<br> It's a regular paper.<br> Karl's real sensitive<br> about having his picture made.<br> He wouldn't be on the bulletin board<br> for the Easter collage.<br> Now...<br> a shovel just makes<br> too goddamn much racket.<br> I'll talk to him, see what he says.<br> You gotta make something explode<br> to truly understand it.<br> You gotta examine all those particles<br> while they're still on fire.<br> Karl, let's go down<br> to the old classroom.<br> Mr. Woolridge has some people<br> for you to see.<br> Let's go.<br> Remember I told you about<br> those newspaper people?<br> They want to ask you questions<br> about your release.<br> They think it'll make a good story.<br> Will you talk to them?<br> Get interviewed?<br> They're women.<br> I think it'd be good for you. You'll see<br> all kinds of people on the outside.<br> This'll help.<br> Now, he'll only talk to you<br> but you can't ask him anything...<br> and don't stare at him.<br> How can I interview him<br> if I can't ask any questions?<br> Sorry, that's the best it's gonna get.<br> Can I ask you a question?<br> If he's so troubled,<br> why are you letting him out?<br> What if he does it again?<br> It happens.<br> His time's up.<br> That's the rules.<br> He's been treated, reevaluated,<br> doesn't show any signs anymore.<br> - Signs?<br> - Homicidal signs.<br> Miss, I'm sorry,<br> but you'll have to step outside.<br> - Why?<br> - Please?<br> I have to change<br> the light in here for Karl.<br> I hope you can still see to write.<br> I reckon what you want to know<br> is what I'm doing in here.<br> I reckon it's because I killed somebody.<br> But I reckon you want to know<br> how come I killed somebody...<br> so I'll start at the front<br> and tell you.<br> I lived out in back of<br> my parents' place most of my life...<br> in a little old shed<br> that my daddy'd built for me.<br> They didn't want me in the house<br> with the rest of them...<br> so I sat around in the shed<br> looking at the ground.<br> I didn't have no floor...<br> but I had me a hole dug out<br> to lay down in...<br> a quilt or two to put down there.<br> My father...<br> was a hardworking man<br> most of his life...<br> not that I can say the same<br> for myself.<br> I mostly just sat around<br> in the shed...<br> tinkered around<br> with a lawn mower or two...<br> went to school off and on<br> from time to time.<br> But the children out there,<br> they were very cruel to me...<br> and made quite a bit of sport of me,<br> made fun of me quite a bit.<br> So mostly I just sat around<br> out there in the shed.<br> My daddy...<br> worked at the sawmill,<br> down at the planer mill...<br> for an old man named Dixon.<br> Old man Dixon was a very cruel fellow.<br> Didn't treat his employees well<br> or pay them well.<br> Didn't pay my daddy too much of a wage.<br> Just barely enough to get by,<br> I reckon.<br> I reckon he got by all right.<br> They used to come out,<br> one or the other of them...<br> usually my mother...<br> feed me pretty regular.<br> So I know he made enough<br> so I could have mustard and biscuits...<br> three or four times a week.<br> But old man Dixon...<br> he had a boy...<br> name of Jesse Dixon.<br> Jesse was more cruel<br> than his daddy was.<br> He used to make<br> quite a bit of sport of me...<br> when I was down there<br> at the schoolhouse.<br> Used to take advantage of the girls<br> in the neighborhood.<br> They used to say...<br> that my mother was a very pretty woman.<br> They said that quite a bit<br> when I'd be there at the schoolhouse.<br> I reckon you want me to get on with it<br> and tell you what happened.<br> So I reckon I'll tell you.<br> I was setting out in the shed<br> one evening, not doing much...<br> just staring at the wall...<br> and waiting on my mother<br> to give me my Bible lesson.<br> I heard a commotion in the house...<br> so I run up on the screened-in porch<br> to look inside.<br> I looked in and seen my mother laying<br> on the floor without any clothes on.<br> I seen Jesse Dixon<br> laying on top of her.<br> He was having his way with her.<br> I just seen red.<br> I picked up a Kaiser blade that was<br> sitting by the door.<br> Some folks called it a sling blade.<br> I called it a Kaiser blade.<br> It's got a long, wood handle,<br> kind of like an ax handle...<br> with a long blade shaped like a banana.<br> Sharp on one edge<br> and dull on the other.<br> It's what the highway boys use<br> to cut down weeds and whatnot. Yeah.<br> I went in the house...<br> and I hit Jesse Dixon<br> upside the head with it...<br> knocked him off my mother.<br> I reckon that didn't satisfy me...<br> so I hit him again in the neck<br> with the sharp edge...<br> and just plumb near cut his head off,<br> killed him.<br> My mother jumped up<br> and started hollering...<br> "What did you kill Jesse for?"<br> Well, come to find out...<br> my mother didn't mind<br> what Jesse was doing to her.<br> That made me madder<br> than what Jesse'd made me...<br> so I took the Kaiser blade...<br> some folks called it a sling blade,<br> I called it a Kaiser blade...<br> and I hit my mother<br> upside the head with it.<br> Killed her.<br> Some folks has asked me...<br> if you had it to do over again,<br> would you do it the same way?<br> I reckon I would.<br> Anyhow, they put me in here...<br> and here I been<br> for a great, long while.<br> I've learned to read some.<br> Took me four years to read the Bible.<br> I reckon I understand<br> a great deal of it.<br> Wasn't what I expected<br> in some places.<br> I've slept in a good bed<br> for a great, long while.<br> Now they've seen fit<br> to put me out of here.<br> They say they're setting me free today.<br> I reckon that's all you was<br> needing to know.<br> You want more details.<br> I reckon I can tell them.<br> I don't know whether that's enough<br> for your newspaper or not.<br> Will you ever kill again, Karl?<br> I don't reckon I got no reason<br> to kill nobody.<br> - Where will he go?<br> - Anywhere he wants.<br> I think he's going to Millsburg where<br> he's from, about 20 miles from here.<br> - Will he be supervised?<br> - As much as anybody, I guess.<br> Y'all have a nice day, now.<br> I'll get Melvin to walk y'all out.<br> Would you walk these girls out?<br> Thank you.<br> I reckon I'll have to get used to<br> looking at pretty people.<br> Guess you will.<br> Reckon I'll have to get used to them<br> looking at me too.<br> Better go get your things.<br> Ain't got nothing but them books.<br> Better go get them.<br> All right, then.<br> All right, then.<br> Can I help you?<br> I was kinda wanting<br> something to eat.<br> Well, what would you like?<br> You got any biscuits in there?<br> No, this is a Frosty Cream.<br> We don't serve biscuits.<br> We got a lot of other stuff.<br> What you got in there<br> that's good to eat?<br> We got Big Chief Burgers,<br> Bongo Burgers...<br> Foot-longs, Corny Dogs,<br> Frosty Shakes, Creamy Bars.<br> Did you want me to go through<br> the whole list?<br> What do you like?<br> Well, the french fries are pretty good.<br> - French fried potatoes?<br> - Yep, french fries.<br> How much you want for them?<br> They're 60 for medium<br> and 75 for large.<br> I reckon I'll have me<br> some of the big ones.<br> All right.<br> One large french fries?<br> These darn things are heavy.<br> Hard to carry too.<br> - You got wash in there?<br> - Yeah.<br> Can't your mama and daddy tend to it?<br> I got a mama but she's at work<br> at Hoochy's Dollar Store.<br> My daddy's dead.<br> He got hit by a train.<br> How far you going<br> with them sacks full of wash?<br> Half a mile, I think.<br> I can help you tote it<br> if I don't give out first.<br> Okay, but you don't have to.<br> All right, then.<br> My name's Frank Wheatley.<br> What's yours?<br> Karl's my name.<br> - What's your last name?<br> - Childers.<br> What are all them books?<br> Oh, different ones.<br> One's the Bible, one's a book<br> on Christmas...<br> one's on how to be a carpenter.<br> - Why do you carry them around?<br> - Ain't got no place to set them down.<br> Don't you live somewhere?<br> Did live at the state hospital.<br> - Why?<br> - I killed some folks a while back.<br> They said I wasn't right in the head so<br> they put me in the nervous hospital...<br> instead of putting me in jail.<br> - They let you out?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How come?<br> - They told me I was well.<br> Had to turn me loose.<br> - Are you well?<br> - I reckon I feel all right.<br> This here's my house.<br> You don't seem like you killed nobody.<br> We can just<br> set these bags on the porch.<br> All right, then.<br> You like to play football?<br> I never was no account at it,<br> never got picked out for it.<br> Me and the Barnett twins<br> and some boys...<br> play at the junior high school field<br> all the time.<br> You want to play, come on over<br> 'cause we ain't no good either.<br> I'll see you later.<br> All right, then.<br> Hon, you can't just go in there.<br> What in the world are you doing here?<br> I want to come back and stay in here.<br> You can't. You're a free man.<br> They let you out so you can<br> do as you please.<br> I reckon I don't care<br> about being a free man.<br> I don't know how<br> to go about it.<br> You'll have to learn.<br> It'll take some time.<br> Don't you have anybody<br> to help you out?<br> No, sir.<br> Your daddy was living there<br> last time I heard.<br> I guess he wouldn't want to<br> help you out any, would he?<br> Sorry. I wasn't thinking.<br> Don't you have anybody?<br> No, sir. Never did know<br> too much of nobody down there.<br> Not to be helping me out,<br> no way.<br> Karl, the truth is...<br> I don't know where they expect you<br> to go, what they expect you to do.<br> If I could, I'd let you come back here<br> and stay if you wanted to.<br> I'm just doing my job.<br> You follow me?<br> Listen, Karl, I know an old boy...<br> who's got a fix-it shop deal<br> in Millsburg.<br> He used to go to church with me.<br> You're good working on<br> small engines and things.<br> If I was to put my neck out<br> for you with him...<br> do you think you could work it<br> if he'll hire you?<br> I'm pretty handy, I reckon,<br> on lawn mowers and whatnot.<br> I know you are.<br> I've seen it myself.<br> - Could you give it a try?<br> - I reckon.<br> Now I can't promise<br> that he'll hire you.<br> I'll have to tell him<br> about your history.<br> I never was no good with history.<br> No. I mean your past.<br> Why you were in here.<br> Take you down first thing<br> in the morning.<br> You don't have<br> anywhere to stay tonight at all?<br> No, sir.<br> It's against the rules<br> for you to stay here.<br> If something happened,<br> I'd be liable.<br> I reckon I can walk around till<br> morning time, sit and read a book.<br> Karl, would you like<br> a muffin?<br> No, thank you.<br> So Jerry's taking you<br> someplace else tomorrow.<br> I don't know nobody named Jerry.<br> That's me, Karl. That's my first name.<br> He's carrying me to look for work<br> down in Millsburg...<br> where I was born.<br> Would you like some coffee?<br> Coffee makes me a mite nervous<br> when I drink it.<br> Daddy, can I go to bed?<br> Sure. You sleep<br> with your mama tonight.<br> I'm sleeping with your brother<br> so Karl can have your room.<br> Why?<br> Because he's company.<br> - Karl, you up?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Didn't you sleep?<br> You been sitting there<br> like that all night?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Come on. We'd better hit the road.<br> All right, then.<br> Jerry, how's it going?<br> - Hey, Bill.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - Good to see you. How's everyone doing?<br> - Pretty good.<br> Kids are driving me crazy, and Phyliss<br> is putting me in the poor house...<br> but I can't complain otherwise.<br> Wouldn't do any good anyway.<br> You know Scooter?<br> Don't believe I do.<br> Good to meet you, Scooter.<br> How about you?<br> Well, this is the one I was<br> telling you about on the phone.<br> If you get nervous, I'll understand,<br> but I'm not going to lie to you.<br> He got into that trouble,<br> but he was young.<br> I remember. He cut them<br> to pieces, and one was his mama.<br> And that Dixon boy.<br> Hell, I always wanted to kill him.<br> He was an asshole.<br> I remember him too.<br> Kinda retarded or something<br> back in school.<br> Seems like he's pretty<br> well-adjusted these days.<br> I don't think he'd ever hurt anybody.<br> He don't look much like he would.<br> And he can fix a small engine real good?<br> He's a whiz. It's all he's done<br> since he was a kid.<br> - You scared of him, Scooter?<br> - No, I don't guess so.<br> - Can he talk?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> You say he can stay<br> out in the back?<br> Fine with me. If he steals anything...<br> I'll take it out of your pocket.<br> He won't steal. He's a good old boy.<br> Keeps to himself.<br> I got a room full of work.<br> Scooter won't do it.<br> Karl, come over here.<br> I want you to meet your new boss.<br> This is Bill Cox.<br> He runs the place.<br> Says you can work here,<br> stay out back.<br> - It's good to know you, Karl.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's minimum wage. There's nothing back<br> there but an army cot and a toilet.<br> That's fine. I'll go to the car<br> and get your books.<br> All right, then.<br> They say you're a whiz on fixing<br> lawn mowers and things.<br> I've tinkered around<br> on them a bit.<br> We order from the Frosty Cream<br> at lunch, usually.<br> We'll buy you lunch<br> till you get on your feet.<br> I like them<br> french fried potatoes.<br> Yeah. Me too.<br> They make a good double meat burger.<br> All right, then.<br> I'll see y'all later.<br> Karl, you done good work.<br> They was right about you.<br> Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of<br> a job if you're not careful.<br> - I'll see y'all tomorrow.<br> - Wait up.<br> I'll leave with you and lock up.<br> There's a blanket under the cot, soap<br> in the bathroom for cleaning up.<br> One more thing. The way we lock<br> these doors, you can't get out at night.<br> - Did you want to go anywhere?<br> - I don't reckon.<br> If it works out, we'll get you a key so<br> you can get out at night.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - All right, then.<br> Did I tell you the one about the two<br> old boys pissing off the bridge?<br> I don't remember.<br> These two old boys hung their peckers<br> off a bridge to piss.<br> One was from California,<br> one from Arkansas.<br> Old boy from California says,<br> "Boy, this water's cold."<br> Old boy from Arkansas says,<br> "Yeah, and it's deep too."<br> Get it?<br> - Yeah, that's a good one.<br> - That is a good one.<br> I do believe you told me that before.<br> I've heard it a bunch.<br> - A long time ago.<br> - Yeah, that's a classic.<br> Karl, I've been thinking, and it's not<br> Christian of me to keep locking you in.<br> You've been in lockup so long,<br> you don't need me to keep doing it.<br> You need to come and go as you please.<br> Here.<br> Take this key. It'll get you<br> in and out of here at night.<br> All right, then.<br> - Them french fries good?<br> - They's good, all right.<br> You got any money?<br> They give me some<br> when they turned me loose.<br> I spent some riding the bus,<br> eating french fried potatoes.<br> I'm going to pay you today<br> for this coming week...<br> so you have some walking-around money.<br> You need to buy some toothpaste and<br> cleaning up supplies to have back there.<br> Get you some magazines<br> and some hard candy...<br> something to keep you busy<br> at night.<br> All right, then.<br> I'll let you off<br> while it's still daylight.<br> I thought I heard somebody on the porch.<br> Wasn't your name Karl?<br> Yes, sir, it is.<br> You're named Frank.<br> Yeah. What are you doing by here?<br> - You said for me to come by.<br> - Wanna play ball with us?<br> I ain't no good at it.<br> I just come by to see you.<br> I was going to see my mama at Hoochy's<br> Dollar Store. She works 2:00 to 8:00.<br> All right, then.<br> You want to go with me?<br> You can meet my mama.<br> I ought not worry your mama<br> with company.<br> Come on. You'll like her.<br> She's real nice.<br> She'll give us anything we want her to,<br> candy or something.<br> I was needing to do some trading.<br> Reckon they sell toothpaste?<br> Yeah, they sell a little bit<br> of everything.<br> I won't tell her about you being in<br> the state hospital for killing.<br> Come on. Let's go.<br> You have to learn to live<br> without all that grease.<br> Here in the South,<br> I like grease in everything.<br> I like fried chicken, fried okra,<br> biscuits and gravy.<br> - It will kill you.<br> - Hey, Mama, Vaughan.<br> - What you up to, sweetheart?<br> - I bet I know.<br> - You want candy and pop, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> That rots your teeth.<br> I've got something better.<br> Potted meat is on special...<br> four cans for a dollar.<br> They're not selling but I'll give<br> the right kid some for free.<br> I don't like potted meat.<br> Daddy said it was made from lips,<br> peckers and intestines.<br> Don't talk that way. Did that<br> strange-looking man follow you in here?<br> Can I help you?<br> That's Karl. I met him<br> at the laundry mat.<br> Karl, this is Mama and Vaughan.<br> Vaughan is the manager.<br> He lets Mama off work anytime<br> because they're best friends.<br> Nice to meet you, Karl.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> Frank, come back here with me<br> for a minute.<br> I haven't seen you here before.<br> No, sir, I don't reckon you have.<br> I haven't been in here before.<br> This store didn't used to be here.<br> It's been here 17 years.<br> Did you live here before?<br> I was born and raised here till<br> I was 12 years old.<br> - What brings you back?<br> - What's that you say?<br> Why are you here now?<br> They turned me loose from<br> the state hospital.<br> Ls that right?<br> How long are you staying?<br> Mr. Woolridge got me hired<br> at Bill Cox's outfit.<br> - You have family here?<br> - Not to speak of.<br> Hey, Karl. Guess what?<br> Mama said you can stay in our garage.<br> Our car doesn't fit anyway.<br> It's real neat.<br> Frank told me about your situation.<br> Frank loves company.<br> Especially after his daddy passed<br> and all.<br> There's no sense in you staying<br> in that greasy old shop.<br> He's mentally retarded,<br> poor thing.<br> - He just go out of the state hospital.<br> - I know.<br> - Can we get some candy and pop?<br> - Sure. Go ahead.<br> Come on.<br> - Is it safe to let him around that guy?<br> - Frank's crazy about him.<br> He likes the way he talks and he helped<br> Frank carry home the laundry.<br> He's been in the hospital a long time.<br> There must be something wrong with him.<br> He's retarded. Frank's always after<br> a father figure.<br> Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one<br> with his mean ass.<br> - What about me?<br> - He doesn't see you as a "guy" guy.<br> Karl's a "guy" guy?<br> I call this my secret place.<br> I come out here when I feel like<br> being alone.<br> I used to come here with Karen Cross.<br> She kind of used to be my girlfriend.<br> We would come out here<br> and hold hands and talk...<br> and read books to each other<br> with a flashlight.<br> She wouldn't have nothing to do with me<br> in front of other people...<br> because Mama and I<br> don't have any money.<br> Her daddy's a dentist,<br> so they're rich.<br> Was your folks well off?<br> No, we barely had enough<br> to scrape by on, I reckon.<br> Your folks still around?<br> My mother's dead.<br> My daddy's still around but he don't<br> want to have nothing to do with me.<br> - How do you know?<br> - He never did want to.<br> I figure he probably<br> ain't changed his mind much.<br> How'd your mama die?<br> You don't need to hear<br> things like that.<br> You just a boy.<br> You need to think good thoughts<br> while you still a boy.<br> There's lots of time for all the other.<br> I had bad thoughts since Daddy died.<br> Sometimes I wish I was still little<br> and he was still here.<br> Mama's real good, but I wish<br> I had both of them.<br> We went to Memphis in the car once.<br> It was raining so hard<br> we couldn't see the road...<br> but I wasn't scared because<br> as long as Daddy was driving...<br> nothing could happen to us.<br> That's the way I feel about Mama now.<br> Mama has a boyfriend now.<br> His name is Doyle Hargraves.<br> He works construction so he makes<br> a pretty good living...<br> but he don't help Mama out<br> with any money.<br> He ain't no good. He's mean to her.<br> He don't like me at all.<br> Mama says he's jealous<br> because I belong to my daddy.<br> He spends the night at our house<br> and he's got his own house.<br> Somebody told me this way<br> he can have more girlfriends.<br> I like the nights he's not there.<br> I ain't so nervous then.<br> How come she's still being girlfriends<br> with him if he's mean to her?<br> She says it's for the times<br> he's good to her.<br> She's lonely since Daddy died.<br> Sometimes she don't know why.<br> He threatened to kill her<br> if she left him.<br> My daddy would kill him if he was here<br> and somebody was mean to Mama.<br> Vaughan's real good to Mama.<br> Vaughan that you met?<br> But he's not able to do anything<br> to Doyle. He's funny.<br> Not "funny, " ha-ha.<br> "Funny, " queer.<br> He likes to go with men.<br> That makes him not able to fight good,<br> but he sure is nice.<br> He's from St. Louis. Queer people<br> get along better in a big town.<br> I wish he like to go with women.<br> I'd rather him be Mama's boyfriend<br> than Doyle.<br> Karl, remember I told you Daddy<br> got hit by a train?<br> Yes, sir, I recollect that.<br> It ain't the truth. He shot himself<br> with a shotgun on purpose.<br> How come him do that?<br> Because he didn't have enough money<br> to take care of us like he wanted to.<br> That's what the letter said.<br> He got laid off of work<br> and did odd jobs.<br> I thought he took care of us<br> just fine.<br> Karl, did you really kill somebody?<br> Yes, sir, I did.<br> - Who'd you kill?<br> - Two people.<br> - Were they bad people?<br> - I thought they was.<br> Maybe they needed it.<br> I growed up and learned that you ain't<br> supposed to kill nobody.<br> It's okay if you're protecting yourself,<br> if it's self-defense.<br> Was it self-defense?<br> My daddy was good.<br> I think too many good people die.<br> That's what I think.<br> You sure you wanna<br> stay with these folks?<br> You're welcome to stay here.<br> It's working out good.<br> That boy wants me to.<br> All right, then.<br> I'll see you bright and early.<br> How's that garden tiller coming?<br> I fixed it.<br> It's working pretty good now.<br> You done fixed it?<br> I'll be damned.<br> Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.<br> Of course, Scooter's about as shiftless<br> as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.<br> You done fixed it.<br> Well, I'll just be damned.<br> - I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - All right, then.<br> I don't guess I'll give a shit, then.<br> I ain't here that much.<br> If you want a retard living<br> in your garage, that's your business.<br> I do got some tools<br> I'd rather not have stoled.<br> I could take those home with me.<br> He's real honest.<br> He wouldn't steal nothing.<br> Frankie, I wasn't talking to you,<br> was I?<br> - No, sir.<br> - "No, sir" is right.<br> I was talking to your mama.<br> It's her decision, not yours.<br> If I let it go on,<br> it's because she asked me, not you.<br> Does this retard drool<br> and rub shit in his hair and all that?<br> I'm going to have a hard time eating<br> around that kind of thing.<br> Just like with antique furniture<br> and midgets.<br> I can't so much as drink a glass of<br> water around a midget or an antique.<br> Doyle, you're awful.<br> You shouldn't be that way.<br> I ain't saying it's right. It's just<br> the truth. He'll make me sick.<br> - What was he in the nut house for?<br> - He's just retarded, I guess.<br> No, he had of gone nuts<br> and did something.<br> A lot of retards running around that<br> ain't locked up in the nut house.<br> Think about it, Linda.<br> You know what he done, Frank?<br> - I ain't sure.<br> - You oughta want to find out.<br> He might have hacked his family<br> to pieces with a hatchet or something.<br> Frank, you'd better ask him.<br> Don't hurt his feelings,<br> but it would be good to know.<br> I'm sure it's nothing.<br> He seems sweet.<br> You're all hung up<br> on people being sweet.<br> He's sweet. Everybody's sweet. Speaking<br> of sweet, where's your girlfriend?<br> - I thought he was coming over.<br> - He'll be here in a while.<br> - We're going for ice cream.<br> - Now ain't that sweet.<br> What do I do about supper while you're<br> running around with that fag?<br> You're not crippled.<br> Go make something.<br> Talking back and everything,<br> aren't you?<br> That makes me horny.<br> Frank, go and play in your room,<br> if Doyle's going to talk nasty.<br> - I don't want to go play.<br> - He don't want to. Let him stay.<br> Let's be a family till your mentally<br> retarded and homosexual friends arrive.<br> Yes, sir?<br> You're really going to stay here.<br> That boy wants me to.<br> Have you knocked yet?<br> - No, sir, I ain't.<br> - How long have you been here?<br> Quite a spell, I reckon.<br> Before you get used to staying here,<br> we need to talk about a few things.<br> Can I take you to lunch?<br> I done ate a little bit ago.<br> I mean tomorrow<br> or the next day.<br> I reckon I could eat something<br> at noontime.<br> Bill Cox generally gets me<br> a box lunch...<br> but I reckon he can<br> lay off doing it tomorrow.<br> Then I'll come by and<br> pick you up around noon, all right?<br> All right, then.<br> There's your girlfriend.<br> Y'all come on in.<br> Come on. Have a seat in here.<br> - Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?<br> - Tolerable, I reckon.<br> Karl, this is Doyle. Frank, you and Karl<br> go fix him up a place in the garage.<br> - Vaughan, you ready to go?<br> - Sure.<br> Honey, don't rush everybody off.<br> - You and Karl want to go with us?<br> - I don't want to.<br> We got things we need to do.<br> Vaughan, you know what I heard?<br> That you been putting it on Albert<br> Sellers over at the funeral home.<br> - I know Albert. We're friends.<br> - I heard you was more than friends.<br> I heard Dick Rivers caught you two<br> going at it in the same room...<br> with poor old Mrs. Ogletree and her dead<br> as a doornail laid out on a gurney.<br> - That's ridiculous, a total lie.<br> - Let's go, Vaughan.<br> We'll be back in a while.<br> I'll bring you something.<br> - Your food's in the oven warming over.<br> - You fixed him something.<br> Vaughan, I was just going on with you.<br> Just joking around. You know, buddy.<br> I know. You're a real card.<br> Karl, come over,<br> sit down and talk to me.<br> Come on, Karl.<br> Let's go to the garage.<br> Goddammit. I want to talk to him.<br> Sit down, Karl.<br> What's in your bag?<br> This and that.<br> Toothpaste and whatnot.<br> - What's all them books?<br> - Different ones.<br> One of them's the Bible.<br> You believe in the Bible,<br> Karl?<br> Yes, sir. A good deal of it.<br> I can't understand all of it.<br> I can't understand none of it.<br> This one begat that one,<br> that one begat this one...<br> and begat and begat and lo and behold<br> someone says some shit to someone.<br> - How retarded are you?<br> - Stop it, Doyle.<br> Frankie, be quiet. We're talking.<br> The adults are talking.<br> Was you in lockup for cutting someone<br> with a hatchet or something?<br> I ain't never used no hatchet<br> that I remember.<br> So you're just crazy<br> in a retard kind of way then?<br> It wouldn't matter to me<br> if you did do violence.<br> I ain't scared of shit.<br> You think I'm scared<br> for you to stay here?<br> You just a humped-over retard.<br> I'm just kidding you.<br> Welcome to our humble home, buddy.<br> Frank needs<br> all the friends he can get.<br> Frank's a weak little kid.<br> His daddy taught him<br> how to be a pussy.<br> Don't talk about my daddy.<br> Go on out to the garage.<br> Leave me be.<br> Go on.<br> Come on, Karl.<br> Don't say nothing<br> about our little spat to your mama.<br> I don't want her worrying.<br> I'd like to kill that son-of-a-bitch.<br> I hate him.<br> You ought not talk that away.<br> You just a boy.<br> Well, I hate him.<br> He ought not talk that away<br> to you neither.<br> He ain't no account. He's mean<br> to you and your mama.<br> Your mama and that fellow that's<br> carrying me to get something to eat's...<br> going to be back directly.<br> Will you be here with us<br> for a long time?<br> I reckon,<br> if you want me to.<br> I got some of that potted meat<br> and soda crackers if you want some.<br> How can you eat all that stuff<br> with them insides it's made out of?<br> I reckon it tastes<br> pretty good to me.<br> I like the way you talk.<br> Well, I like the way you talk.<br> You think it's really got<br> peckers in there?<br> You know better than to say that word.<br> It smells kinda funny.<br> It's a little loud.<br> Looky right here.<br> I believe you right.<br> I believe I see one in there.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Mister, could you hand me<br> that mustard over there?<br> Thank you.<br> Okay, Karl.<br> The reason that I...<br> brought you here is...<br> to talk about something<br> that's on my mind.<br> I'm just going to put it<br> right out on the table.<br> Where do I start?<br> Linda and Frank are<br> very important to me.<br> They're like family.<br> My own family was never like a family.<br> They're horrible people.<br> As a matter of fact...<br> for years I prayed every night<br> that my father would die...<br> and finally realized,<br> through a lot of therapy...<br> I was wasting my energy<br> on hating him.<br> So now I just don't care.<br> But you see, you and I<br> are a lot alike...<br> as strange as that may seem.<br> I don't mean physically<br> or even mentally, really...<br> but emotionally.<br> Actually, the hand<br> we've been dealt in life...<br> We're different. People see us<br> as being different, anyway.<br> You're...<br> You've got...<br> your affliction or whatever and I...<br> Well, mine's not as easy to see.<br> I'm just going to say it.<br> I'm gay.<br> Does that surprise you?<br> That I'm gay?<br> - You know what "gay" is, don't you?<br> - I don't reckon.<br> Homosexual.<br> I like men. Sexually.<br> Not "funny, " ha-ha.<br> "Funny, " queer.<br> That's an offensive way<br> to put it.<br> You shouldn't say that.<br> You were taught that,<br> weren't you?<br> I've heard it said that away,<br> yes, sir.<br> Anyway, it's hard to live gay...<br> that's the right way to say it...<br> in a small town like this.<br> I've wanted to leave many times, but...<br> because I love...<br> Linda, Frank and...<br> a certain other person...<br> They've kept me here.<br> Anyway, I'm rambling.<br> If you're going to live<br> in the Wheatley garage...<br> you need to know it's<br> not going to be easy.<br> Doyle is a monster.<br> Not just a closed-minded redneck,<br> but a monster, a dangerous person.<br> I've told Linda that one day that man<br> is going to hurt her and that boy...<br> maybe even kill them.<br> I see it in his eyes.<br> I'm very in tune, even psychic.<br> But Doyle is going to<br> make your life hell.<br> There's one more thing.<br> It's none of my business why you were<br> in the state hospital.<br> Everybody has something<br> in their past.<br> Maybe...<br> you tried suicide.<br> Maybe you did something terrible.<br> But what I see before me...<br> is a gentle...<br> simple man.<br> All I want you to promise me...<br> is that you are capable of being<br> around Frank and Linda.<br> You know. You would never...<br> hurt either of them<br> for any reason, would you?<br> I would never hurt them.<br> That's what I thought. I'm sorry<br> if I've offended you in any way.<br> You seem like a thinker, you know.<br> You seem to always be deep in thought.<br> What are you thinking right now?<br> I was thinking I might wanna take some<br> of these potatoes home with me.<br> How about before that?<br> Let me think.<br> Before that, I was thinking...<br> I could use me six or eight cans<br> of that potted meat...<br> if you got any extra.<br> Frankie, get some of this salad.<br> Hold your plate up for me.<br> I'm just gonna reach.<br> How come Karl won't eat in here with us?<br> I don't know.<br> He said he'd eat out there.<br> I wouldn't let it get to you.<br> Put some dressing on there.<br> - Yes.<br> - I just feel sorry for the poor thing.<br> Who the hell could eat with him making<br> all that racket in his throat?<br> He does make some funny noises.<br> I like the way he talks.<br> Sounds like a race car motor idling.<br> Makes me not be nervous.<br> I'm glad of it.<br> What have you got to be nervous about?<br> You're a kid.<br> You got no bills to pay,<br> no business to run.<br> You don't even have to have a job.<br> You got no old lady on your ass at all.<br> I don't know.<br> I just stay nervous.<br> Could I have some of that ham?<br> Yeah. I'm sorry.<br> Thank you.<br> - You know what, by God?<br> - What?<br> I know what I ought to do tonight.<br> Please, don't.<br> I'm gonna call up Morris<br> and get the band together.<br> We're gonna party our asses off.<br> I'd love to show them Karl.<br> They'd get a kick out of him.<br> Not tonight.<br> I'm not up for it.<br> They always stay till morning.<br> I'll just give out.<br> You don't gotta do nothing.<br> Just put chips in a bowl...<br> and run ice out to us<br> when we get low.<br> Last time, you got mad and run Morris<br> and them off and told them to stay away.<br> That ain't none of your business.<br> Besides, that's the way friends are.<br> Fuck. I'm calling them up.<br> Linda, go into the garage<br> and get my guitar.<br> It's out there with that looney toon.<br> Now?<br> Yeah, now.<br> I'm calling them up.<br> Morris, what you doing, boy?<br> Where's Randy and them?<br> Yeah, now. Please.<br> Frankie, go help your mom.<br> - When are we gonna eat?<br> - Hang on.<br> Eat when you come back.<br> Get my guitar.<br> Come on, sugar.<br> I wanna get together.<br> Yeah.<br> Call him.<br> One. Two. One, two, three, four.<br> You gotta play through it. Wail on the<br> gig, but you gotta play through it.<br> - No, you play through...<br> - You like that, Vaughan?<br> Sure. It sounds like<br> a number one hit tune.<br> Karl, did you like that?<br> - I reckon.<br> - I wish you'd all lay off for tonight!<br> - I can't think with that racket!<br> - Hey!<br> - It's nighttime.<br> - Hey!<br> - I'm calling the police!<br> - I told you already!<br> The law's on my side!<br> I play cards with J.D. Shelnut,<br> chief of police!<br> So kiss my ass, you old bastard!<br> You and Frank clean this mess up.<br> Put the tarp over these instruments.<br> Me and the boys are going to<br> the county line. We're out of liquor.<br> Karl, come with us.<br> Vaughan, come on.<br> It's late.<br> I have to work tomorrow.<br> Don't be a pussy.<br> We all gotta work tomorrow.<br> - Come on.<br> - He don't want to.<br> Don't go if you don't want to.<br> You'll wreck, Doyle. You're drunk.<br> I ain't gonna wreck.<br> I'll be good. I promise.<br> I love you, sweetie.<br> Come on, Karl. Go with us.<br> Just trying to make these two<br> feel like they're part of it.<br> Come on, Vaughan.<br> This'll be fun.<br> Karl, let's go.<br> Come on.<br> - You gotta lay out on that tambourine.<br> - I ain't did nothing wrong.<br> Hey! Ain't anybody gonna come get me?<br> I don't understand<br> what you are talking about.<br> - Exactly the point, my young friend.<br> - I don't get it.<br> I rest my case.<br> Morris is real smart<br> with philosophies and things.<br> That's why him and me is the<br> songwriting team of our group.<br> I come up with the good tunes,<br> or melodies, as we call them...<br> Morris is the lyrics.<br> Not unlike Gary Brooker<br> of Procol Harum.<br> We don't ever played songs<br> y'all wrote. I ain't heard one of them.<br> Y'all just talk.<br> We don't play any songs<br> with words at all.<br> We ain't got no fucking microphone!<br> We ain't got no speakers!<br> We wrote one last night<br> outside the mini-mart.<br> Morris called it, "Stuart Drives<br> a Comfortable Car."<br> Then, like in country songs,<br> in parenthesis it says...<br> "There's usually someone in the trunk."<br> And I came up with a tune,<br> just humming.<br> You don't wanna question<br> a genius, Vaughan.<br> Morris here's a modern-day poet.<br> Kind of like in the olden times.<br> Yeah, I got a new tune. This<br> composition's entitled, "The Thrill."<br> Goes something like this:<br> I stand on the hill,<br> not for a thrill...<br> but for a breath of a fresh kill.<br> Never mind the man who contemplates...<br> doing away with license plates.<br> He stands alone anyhow...<br> baking the cookies of discontent...<br> by the heat of the laundromat vent.<br> Leaving his soul.<br> Then, like in poetry,<br> I go dot, dot, dot.<br> You know, kind of off-center,<br> then I drop down...<br> and then I go: Leaving his soul...<br> parting the waters<br> of the medulla oblongata...<br> of...<br> mankind.<br> Damn good song, wasn't it?<br> You like that song?<br> All right.<br> I don't think that's right.<br> I believe the "dot, dot, dot"<br> come between...<br> "medulla" and "oblongata."<br> Well, it did.<br> The dots are where I say they are.<br> Melody and tune.<br> That's your trade, Terence.<br> You're a tunesmith.<br> I don't understand the words.<br> Y'all don't shut up,<br> I'm gonna go out of my mind.<br> Besides, Karl's liable to bust his<br> spring.

We could invite her.<br> Would you like that?<br> I reckon I wouldn't mind<br> having a little supper.<br> Vaughan's friend will be there too.<br> He works at the funeral home.<br> You know, Frank really likes you a lot.<br> He says you make him feel calm.<br> I like Frank.<br> He's a good boy.<br> Me and him made friends.<br> It ain't right for me to keep<br> from telling you...<br> how come me to be in a state hospital.<br> That's okay.<br> It's not really my business.<br> Have wondered, though.<br> Why was it?<br> Was it like a nervous breakdown?<br> I killed my mother<br> and an old boy named Jesse Dixon.<br> I thought they's doing wrong.<br> I was about your boy's age.<br> They told me I'm well from it now.<br> Was that you?<br> I remember that.<br> I was only three or four...<br> but I always heard about it<br> growing up.<br> They say you're well?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I like your garage.<br> I never would hurt you or that boy.<br> I'd lay my hand on the Bible<br> and say the same thing.<br> I know you wouldn't, hon.<br> Well, I'll make you some biscuits.<br> How about you, Jerry?<br> - How are you, Bill?<br> - Doing pretty good.<br> Got a sick tiller.<br> What's got you down this way?<br> I thought I'd check up on Karl.<br> See how things are working out.<br> He's pretty quiet, except for them<br> rackets and breathing things he does.<br> He ain't threatening me<br> with a killing or nothing.<br> You couldn't have been more right<br> about him fixing things.<br> He's a regular Eli Whitney<br> on a lawn mower.<br> And loves french fries. He can eat<br> four larges and won't even belch.<br> I'm proud to have him.<br> - Him staying working out?<br> - He's gone to staying with...<br> that Wheatley boy and his mama<br> in their garage.<br> That little boy's adopted<br> him like a mascot.<br> He got a key here<br> to come and go as he pleases.<br> He's working out real good.<br> - Can I see him?<br> - Sure.<br> Scooter, take Jerry in<br> to talk to Karl.<br> All right.<br> Sure you'll be okay<br> staying with that woman and her boy?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Do they know about you?<br> My history?<br> Yeah.<br> I told them about it.<br> They know I'm well.<br> That Miss Wheatley<br> made me some biscuits.<br> I'll be.<br> That boy, he's my friend.<br> He likes the way I talk,<br> and I like the way he talks.<br> I knew you were gonna be all right.<br> I just wanna check on you.<br> I'm gonna tell Bill good-bye<br> and head on back.<br> All right, then.<br> Karl, see if you can<br> figure out what's wrong with this thing.<br> It won't crank up. Everything seems<br> to be put together right.<br> - Bill, I'll see you.<br> - Okay. Stop back by.<br> Don't worry about your boy.<br> He's doing good.<br> It ain't got no gas in it.<br> You see there, Scooter.<br> Thinks of the simplest things first.<br> - Does everybody like the food?<br> - Yeah.<br> Good. I haven't decided yet<br> if I'm a good cook.<br> Karl, you know what?<br> Melinda was voted employee of the month<br> at the Dollar Store last February.<br> Isn't that something?<br> Yes, ma'am. I reckon.<br> When you like pricing items<br> as much as I do...<br> it's just bound to happen<br> sooner or later, I guess.<br> Maybe you and Melinda<br> might like to take a walk tonight.<br> - It's such a nice evening.<br> - Vaughan, don't get pushy.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I kind of like walking<br> from time to time.<br> I stay on my feet all the time at work.<br> I just can't find shoes<br> that's comfortable.<br> Hospital shoes might be the answer.<br> Nurse's shoes.<br> Or the kind old ladies wear<br> who work in school cafeterias.<br> Same difference.<br> I get real mean when my feet hurt.<br> It's the only time<br> I don't like checking out customers.<br> When my feet hurt.<br> You and Karl aren't talking much.<br> You boys must really like that food.<br> Well, I ain't got nothing to say<br> about shoes.<br> Listen, everybody.<br> This might sound corny, but...<br> I've had some wine<br> and that tends to make me emotional...<br> but I'm gonna say it anyway.<br> It came over me in a rush.<br> I just want you all to know...<br> that I care about<br> each and every person at this table.<br> Thank you.<br> That's really sweet of you.<br> We care about you too.<br> Don't we, y'all?<br> Yeah.<br> Also, please don't tell anyone<br> at the store...<br> that Albert was here tonight.<br> Why?<br> You know how this town is.<br> People talk...<br> and they spread cruel rumors.<br> Unfortunately, there's certain parts<br> of my life I have to keep private.<br> You mean about you and Albert<br> being together in that way?<br> - Yes.<br> - I think everybody already knows.<br> They're always talking about it.<br> Maureen Ledbetter told<br> the most awful story...<br> about why you ain't allowed<br> at the First Baptist Church no more.<br> Karl, why don't you and Melinda<br> take a walk? It's nice out.<br> All right, then.<br> That sure was quick.<br> You walk fast, don't you?<br> I reckon.<br> These are the worst shoes I own<br> for walking.<br> How far'd you say you want to go?<br> I don't reckon<br> I thought about it too much.<br> I don't know.<br> She just ain't catching fire.<br> I don't know.<br> She just ain't catching fire.<br> Did you check them points?<br> No, I didn't.<br> That's probably it.<br> - Yes, ma'am?<br> - Ls Karl here?<br> Yes. Just a minute.<br> Karl. There's somebody out here<br> to see you.<br> Some gal holding a nice bouquet.<br> Come on out. She wants to talk to you.<br> Don't just sit there.<br> Hi. I'm on my lunch break.<br> These are on sale<br> 'cause they're not fresh.<br> Two ninety-nine a bunch, plus<br> my ten percent employee discount.<br> Since I didn't bring nothing for you<br> on our date last night...<br> I thought you might like to have them.<br> Thank you.<br> Scooter, let's go over to the Frosty<br> Cream and pick up something for lunch.<br> I can go.<br> You don't have to.<br> - You don't never go.<br> - Goddammit, Scooter. Let's go.<br> Pardon my language, ma'am.<br> Well, I just thought I'd bring them.<br> I liked walking with you.<br> I got a blister the size of a quarter<br> on one heel.<br> Well, I'll see you sometime, I guess.<br> Blisters sure can hurt.<br> Yeah.<br> Flowers is pretty.<br> I've always thought that.<br> Me too.<br> Hey, Karl.<br> How'd you know I was in the garage?<br> I seen that door cracked open a little.<br> I figured you was in there.<br> - You off of work?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Where'd you get them flowers?<br> That gal that made employee of the month<br> at the Dollar Store.<br> She gave them to me<br> for walking with her.<br> I was going over to the secret place.<br> I borrowed one of your books.<br> You ain't mad, are you?<br> No, sir. You can look at every one<br> of my books you want to.<br> Thank you.<br> It's name's "A Christmas Carol."<br> That's that one on Christmas<br> I was telling you about.<br> You wanna go with me?<br> All right, then.<br> - Yeah. Come on.<br> - All right.<br> Know why I want you<br> to play ball with me?<br> No.<br> 'Cause it's fun.<br> Don't matter if you ain't no good.<br> It takes your mind<br> off of everything else.<br> And when you're trying to score<br> a touchdown...<br> that's all you're thinking about.<br> I ain't no account,<br> but Daddy always said...<br> he was proud of me when I threw the ball<br> and ran with it.<br> Did you have any brothers and sisters<br> growing up to play with?<br> I had one there for a little bit.<br> But...<br> it didn't get old enough<br> for me to play with it.<br> Why not? It die?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Why?<br> It got born a little too early.<br> My mother and father<br> made it come out too early.<br> So it died when it come out?<br> My daddy come out to the shed<br> and got me...<br> said, "Here. Take this<br> and throw it away."<br> He handed me a towel<br> with something or another in it.<br> I started for that barrel...<br> and I opened up the towel<br> 'cause there was a noise...<br> and something moving around in it.<br> That towel was all bloody-like<br> all around it there.<br> It was a little old baby,<br> not no bigger than a squirrel.<br> It was alive?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Right then it was.<br> A boy or girl?<br> It was a little old boy.<br> You threw it in the trash barrel?<br> That didn't seem right to me.<br> So I went into the shed<br> and got a shoe box...<br> and emptied out the screwdrivers,<br> washers and nuts...<br> and things out of it.<br> I taken the little feller<br> and put him in the box...<br> buried him in the corner of the yard.<br> That seemed more proper to me,<br> I reckon.<br> It was still alive when you buried it?<br> I heard it crying a little<br> through that box.<br> That don't seem right. It seems like<br> you would have took care of him...<br> if he was your brother.<br> I wasn't but six or eight.<br> I reckon I didn't know<br> what to do.<br> I didn't know how to care<br> for no baby.<br> My mother and father didn't want him.<br> They learned me to do<br> what they told me to do.<br> I figure it probably best we give him<br> right back to the good Lord...<br> right off the bat anyhow.<br> That makes me feel real sad.<br> Couldn't you have done something?<br> I would have.<br> I wish I'd had him.<br> He'd still be right here, now.<br> Living.<br> It makes me sad too.<br> I wish there was something<br> I could have did about it.<br> I don't think nothing bad<br> oughta happen to children.<br> I think all those bad things<br> oughta be saved up...<br> for the folks that done growed up,<br> that's the way I see it.<br> I shouldn't have told you about that.<br> Boy your age ought not<br> to hear such things.<br> It just kind of come out.<br> I didn't mean to say nothing<br> bad about you.<br> You're good.<br> You don't mean no harm.<br> You ever think about killing yourself<br> on purpose, like Daddy did?<br> I studied about it some.<br> Bible says you ought not to.<br> Says you do that,<br> you go off to Hades.<br> Some folks call it hell.<br> I call it Hades.<br> Bible says the same thing<br> about killing others too.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I reckon it does.<br> Spend more time over here...<br> Well, hell.<br> There's the boys.<br> How you doing?<br> Glad you all came back.<br> I was wanting to talk to y'all.<br> Come sit down.<br> Come on. Sit down.<br> I was just telling Linda...<br> We were thinking that things...<br> would be a lot better if I spent<br> more time over here.<br> And if we could...<br> Hell, I'll just start over.<br> I took off work early today, and your<br> mama did the same, so we could talk.<br> Really what I came over here to do<br> was apologize...<br> which ain't easy for me...<br> about how I acted the other night.<br> I admit it.<br> I was drunk.<br> I got all worked up<br> and one thing led to another.<br> I care about you all, though.<br> I do.<br> I don't mean to be so damned...<br> well, asshole-ish,<br> I guess would be the word.<br> Karl, I don't believe I hit you,<br> did I?<br> So no apology necessary, I guess.<br> But, Frankie, I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry I hit your mama.<br> It's just that I'm jealous of her.<br> I don't like her life<br> or how she lives it.<br> I don't like homosexuals.<br> And she goes out and buddies<br> up with one, so I gotta deal with that.<br> I don't like wimpy-ass kids<br> or mental retards...<br> and she got one of each<br> living with her.<br> I'm just kidding about that.<br> I mean, we all got to get along...<br> no matter what our differences are.<br> See, I work construction.<br> I build things.<br> You understand how important that is<br> to the world, Frankie?<br> I don't know if you realize<br> the pressure a man like me's got on him.<br> The upshot is, I'm gonna be spending<br> a lot more time here.<br> We're gonna all get along<br> like a family should.<br> I might even surprise you<br> and pop the question.<br> Well.<br> I'm gonna get on back over<br> to the job site...<br> lock up some stuff over there.<br> I just wanted to stop by and give y'all<br> a little piece of happiness today.<br> Bye-bye.<br> You be a good boy now.<br> Hear me?<br> Well, at least he's trying...<br> but who knows for how long.<br> He's lying, Mama.<br> He'll never do better.<br> I know, honey.<br> Just remember what I said.<br> We'll bide our time.<br> You just steer clear of him<br> as much as you can.<br> Doyle's had a hard life.<br> It's just about run him crazy.<br> We had hard lives too, Mama.<br> You're a hell of a boy, Frank.<br> Someday, you're gonna get<br> all the good things you deserve.<br> Karl's gonna get some more biscuits<br> tonight. What do you think about that?<br> I could sure use some.<br> Karl, come unload<br> a generator for me.<br> Lift this thing down<br> and carry it to the back.<br> - It's on the blink.<br> - You want us to help you lift that?<br> No. That Karl's strong enough<br> to lift a bulldozer.<br> He can fix anything too.<br> He's mentally retarded, but he's a whiz<br> at small engines.<br> The Lord works in mysterious ways.<br> What I was telling you was,<br> he didn't just make the team...<br> Coach says he's gonna<br> start him at end on defense.<br> Guy's a chip off the old block,<br> ain't you, Steve?<br> - I guess so.<br> - How's the rest of the team look?<br> Pretty good.<br> We expect to do well.<br> - Got a quarterback this year?<br> - Jeff Bailey's boy. You know him.<br> - Got a good arm. A little slow.<br> - I watched him in junior high.<br> He throws the ball pretty well.<br> He's taller now.<br> You gonna start at the defensive end?<br> Hup!<br> Come on, man!<br> Good job, Karl.<br> We got a touchdown.<br> That was a good lateral.<br> That was just like the wishbone.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I darned near made me a touchdown.<br> Then I seen them boys<br> bearing down on me.<br> Figured I better give it off<br> to you. I seen you following me.<br> We liable to win<br> if we keep this up.<br> For somebody like you,<br> you sure can run fast.<br> - Come on. Let's kick off to them.<br> - All right, then.<br> I know you could have<br> scored that touchdown by yourself...<br> instead of throwing it over to me.<br> Them boys was trying to pull me down<br> pretty hard.<br> You're strong.<br> You just threw it to me...<br> where I could score that touchdown<br> so I'd feel good.<br> My daddy used to do<br> that kind of thing.<br> It don't matter to me about us losing.<br> Does it to you?<br> No, sir.<br> It was fun anyhow.<br> I wasn't thinking about nothing else,<br> just like you told me I'd do.<br> Can we play every Saturday?<br> If I ain't too stove up.<br> I ain't like you.<br> I'm old and give out.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> I'd kick your head in<br> 25 years ago.<br> You're dead, I guess.<br> Where'd you go to?<br> I know, Mother. That's kind of sad.<br> I was drunk when I did it.<br> I'm your boy.<br> I ain't got no boy.<br> I'm your oldest boy,<br> name of Karl.<br> I ain't got no boy.<br> They turned me loose<br> from the nervous hospital.<br> Said I was well.<br> I got hired on to work for Mr. Bill Cox,<br> fixing lawn mowers and whatnot.<br> That grass out there in the yard<br> growed up quite a bit.<br> I figured I might cut it for you.<br> I told you I ain't got no boy.<br> Get on out of here and let me be.<br> You ain't no kin to me.<br> I learned to read some.<br> I read the Bible quite a bit.<br> I can't understand all of it.<br> But I reckon I understand<br> a good deal of it.<br> Them stories you and Mama told me,<br> they ain't in there.<br> You ought not done that to your boy.<br> I studied on killing you.<br> I studied about it quite a bit.<br> But I reckon there's no need for it<br> if all you're gonna do...<br> is sit there in that chair.<br> You'll be dead soon enough.<br> And the world'll be shut of you.<br> You ought not kill my little brother.<br> He ought of had<br> a chance to growed up.<br> He would have had fun sometime.<br> Little feller.<br> What the goddamn hell<br> you doing up in the middle of the night?<br> What you want, hon?<br> I wanna be baptized.<br> Get baptized then.<br> I don't give a shit!<br> Call up a fucking preacher!<br> We can't baptize you.<br> We'll go see Brother Epersom tomorrow<br> and get you baptized.<br> It's Sunday.<br> You go on back to bed now.<br> What are you doing<br> with that damn hammer?<br> I don't rightly know.<br> I just woke up holding it.<br> - What's he's doing with that hammer?<br> - I don't know.<br> Upon his profession of faith<br> in our Lord Jesus Christ...<br> in obedience under His command...<br> and by the authority of this church...<br> I indeed baptize this brother...<br> in the name of the Father<br> and the Son...<br> and the Holy Ghost.<br> Amen.<br> Marie, would you sing 137, please?<br> Softly and tenderly<br> Jesus is calling<br> Calling for you and for me<br> - How'd the baptizing go?<br> - Real good.<br> Yeah? Good.<br> I'm kind of hungry.<br> Isn't it about time to eat?<br> You know what I got a crave for?<br> Some of that Chicken Champ.<br> Why don't you run down and get some?<br> I'll buy.<br> Would y'all like that?<br> It sounds fine to me.<br> I'd value me a chicken leg or two.<br> - Get some of their cole slaw too.<br> - Okay.
