As tall as me perhaps.<br> Her name was Latika.<br> Don't know anyone of that name.<br> Two chicken burgers, two<br> fries, one diet cola, one coke!<br> One mineral water!<br> Shimla.<br> I'm going to Chowpatty, ok? Wanna come?<br> For god's sake, you've got some disease?<br> You're forcing back to this shithole.<br> We leave our friends, a good life,<br> lots of money. For this?!<br> We came back to find her.<br> You did. I don't give a shit about her.<br> Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.<br> Oh yes!<br> You should come back to<br> the Cages on Saturday night,<br> instead of ghost searching<br> for your lost love.<br> I'm going to Chowpatty.<br> I'm going to Chowpatty!<br> There are 19 million<br> people in this city, Jamal.<br> Forget about her.<br> She's a "stree"(? = young<br> indian female dancer).<br> Greetings, Sir.<br> Blessings be unto those<br> who do good for others.<br> Dollars.
