                        Parkman.<br> Hey, soldier.<br> This is Parkman.<br> They told me to call you at Parkman.<br> Who told you?<br> The guys that put you on the bus.<br> They told me Parkman<br> was your hometown.<br> - Isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Used to be.<br> - Just these two?<br> - Yeah.<br> No, thanks. You got time for a beer?<br> Uh, no, thanks. There's<br> nothing open yet anyway.<br> Hey, where are you going?<br> You were gonna go without me, huh?<br> Look, uh, baby, it's a<br> little early for, uh...<br> Well, I like that. You ask a person to<br> come on a trip with you and then you...<br> Hold it, hold it,<br> hold it. I asked you?<br> If you didn't, you don't think<br> I would have come, do you?<br> What am I, a tramp or something?<br> Gilly's Green Room, Chicago.<br> I was with Raymond.<br> - Raymond. Raymond?<br> - The fella you took a poke at.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Now you remember?<br> I'd like to forget it.<br> Gee, Dave, you know,<br> you sure was sweet to me.<br> - Uh, look...<br> - You know something?<br> I would kind of like to have a soft<br> bed. What do you say that, uh...? Ooh.<br> What do you say we go rest up...<br> ...and after that, then<br> we go meet your family?<br> That's just about the highest<br> compliment that a fella can pay his girl.<br> - Asking to meet his folks and everything.<br> - Look, look, look, sweetie. Um...<br> I feel badly about this, but this<br> is no town for a girl like you.<br> You don't want me here?<br> No, I didn't say that.<br> It's just that, well, I got<br> things to do here, you know?<br> So why don't you just go somewhere<br> and get some rest and freshen up?<br> Bus leaves in an... Twelve<br> noon or 12:30, I don't know.<br> Oh, you don't have to do that, Dave.<br> Well, I did take you<br> pretty far out of your way.<br> Fifty dollars.<br> Look, I'm really sorry.<br> But you know, a guy gets loaded...<br> ...and meets a girl and, you know...<br> You're a nice kid. I like you.<br> Take care, huh?<br> Hi.<br> Must have dozed off.<br> - I could have robbed the joint.<br> - Yeah, if you needed stamps.<br> I want the best room in the house.<br> At 7.50 a day?<br> I promised myself if I had to come back<br> here I'd have the best room in the house.<br> Hirsh?<br> - Hey, you related to Frank Hirsh?<br> - Brother.<br> Didn't know he had one.<br> I was beginning to get<br> the same feeling myself.<br> - You don't look like him.<br> - Thanks.<br> This way.<br> Anything else, Mr. Hirsh?<br> Yeah, you can get me<br> a bucket of ice, huh?<br> And, uh...<br> ...I got a bank draft here for 5500<br> bucks. I want you to run it over...<br> ...to the Citizen's National Bank.<br> Soon as they open, deposit it.<br> Fifty-five hundred?<br> True.<br> And pick me up a couple<br> bottles of whiskey.<br> Any blended whiskey would be good.<br> You said, uh, Citizen's National?<br> Yeah.<br> Your brother, Frank, isn't he<br> on the board at the other bank?<br> Parkman Savings and Loan?<br> Yeah, I believe he is.<br> I won't be able to leave<br> before the bellboy gets here.<br> But the banks don't open before 10.<br> Ten will be fine. That's great.<br> - That's a very popular<br> pattern nowadays. Beautiful.<br> Good morning, ladies. Good morning.<br> - You're shopping for the wedding already?<br> - We're looking at some silver patterns.<br> Virginia, I haven't had a chance<br> to offer my congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Have you found anything you like?<br> Well, Virginia likes the modern, and<br> she is the one that's getting married.<br> But it's my idea of nothing.<br> Well, I personally prefer<br> the traditional myself...<br> ...but a lot of discriminating<br> ladies are ordering modern these days.<br> Al, let's show them the Tobi<br> pattern. It's a lovely design.<br> Frank, I just heard about your<br> brother, Dave, being back in town.<br> Isn't it exciting?<br> Oh.<br> You see, it has classic lines, but it<br> still has the simplicity of the modern.<br> Frank. I said, isn't exciting about<br> your brother, Dave, being back in town?<br> Oh, Dave. Ha-ha. It certainly is.<br> And it's real good to have him back.<br> - I suppose...<br> - Now, make yourselves comfortable...<br> ...and, Al, you take<br> good care of them, now.<br> I'll try, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Oh, just a minute. Here he is now.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Hirsh.<br> - Morning, Edith.<br> It's for you.<br> - Oh, who is it?<br> - Ned Deacon. He says it's important.<br> That means it's important to him.<br> Hello, Ned. What's on your<br> mind, if anything, huh?<br> Did you hear your brother,<br> Dave, is back in town?<br> Oh, of course I knew he was. He,<br> uh... He called me this morning.<br> Well, did your brother tell you...<br> ...he deposited over<br> $5000 in the other bank?<br> Oh?<br> Now, Frank, as a director<br> of Parkman Savings...<br> ...that sure don't make you look good.<br> I'm sure he got his banks mixed up.<br> Yeah, I know that, Ned.<br> I know you got me<br> that appointment, yes.<br> Oh, certainly. You bet<br> I'll straighten it out.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah. So long.<br> Anything wrong, Mr. Hirsh?<br> Oh, no, no, no. Not a thing.<br> - Dave?<br> - Come on in, this is the place.<br> - How'd you know it was me?<br> - Figured it'd be you.<br> Dave, you old son of<br> a gun, welcome home.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Oh, it's good to see you, boy.<br> It's been a long time.<br> Sixteen years.<br> - Oh, you dog, you.<br> Sixteen years and not even a postcard.<br> I didn't figure you'd worry about me.<br> Oh, you're looking fine, Dave.<br> Oh, I know, I know, it's<br> getting a little thin on top.<br> But like they say, "Not much<br> grass on a busy street. "<br> You may be losing your hair,<br> but you haven't lost your wit.<br> - You want a drink?<br> - What, at 10:30 in the morning?<br> - I don't watch a<br> clock. - Ha-ha-ha.<br> Oh, whatever happened to your writing?<br> When we used to see your name in print...<br> ...at least we knew you were alive.<br> - I gave it up.<br> - Why? You were doing pretty good.<br> - You got some...<br> - The old man still around?<br> Oh. Oh, you didn't know?<br> No, no, God rest his soul. He<br> passed on four or five years ago.<br> Towards the end, Dave, he<br> was just hell on wheels.<br> - Booze, huh?<br> - Well, well, what else?<br> Whew. What a family.<br> Ohh, wait till you see<br> the new generation, Dave.<br> Why, that niece of yours? A real lady.<br> Say, why don't you pack up<br> and move out to the house, huh?<br> We got plenty of room.<br> Well, I'm pretty sure we have.<br> No, thanks, Frank. I<br> got it made right here.<br> Well, let me call Agnes and have her<br> get a fatted calf out of the deep freeze.<br> - You're gonna have dinner with us tonight.<br> - Sorry, Frank, I got plans.<br> Oh, uh, well, what<br> are your plans, Davey?<br> What made you decide<br> to come back to Parkman?<br> I shot my big fat mouth off<br> to a couple drunken friends...<br> ...and told them where I was born.<br> - What's wrong? Parkman is your home.<br> How'd you know I was here?<br> Practically everybody in town<br> knew you were here before I did.<br> You might have called me,<br> Dave. You owe me that much.<br> Oh, I owe you more than that.<br> Four hundred and ten dollars to be<br> exact. I got the check all made out.<br> What's that for?<br> This little check represents room and<br> board at Mrs. Dilman's home for little boys.<br> Three dollars and 50 cents a week from the<br> time I was 12 until I read a travel folder.<br> - You can't still be brooding about that.<br> - I'm not brooding. I'm grateful.<br> I was a little better off than most of<br> the kids. I had a generous big brother.<br> I was what they called<br> a semi-charity boarder.<br> What did you expect me to do?<br> Have the family move in with me?<br> You knew I just married Agnes.<br> Good Lord, Dave, you're a man now.<br> You know that a man has<br> to live his own life.<br> How is Agnes, Frank?<br> Ohh...<br> Davey, I did what I thought was right.<br> Nobody can do any more than that.<br> Sure it was tough on you,<br> but how do you think I felt?<br> Putting you in the<br> home? My only brother.<br> I'm not made of wood, Dave.<br> If you only knew the nights<br> that I couldn't sleep.<br> Your story moves me to tears.<br> - Take the check.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> Take it.<br> All right, if it'll make<br> you feel any happier.<br> I'm not gonna fight with you,<br> Dave. Life's too short for that.<br> Why don't you have dinner<br> with us? I'd like it very much.<br> Not that it'll look funny<br> if you didn't, you know...<br> ...but will you do it?<br> - What time?<br> - You mean you'll come?<br> If you're sure Agnes won't throw up.<br> - I'm not her favorite relative.<br> - Oh, what talk.<br> Meet me at the store, say, 5.<br> And I'll call Agnes and have her<br> fix up something real special, huh?<br> Oh. Ha-ha.<br> Uh, about that little gag of yours of<br> putting the dough in the other bank.<br> - You know, that's...<br> - I thought it would break you up.<br> - See you at 5.<br> - See you.<br> No, Frank. Oh, no.<br> I will not have him in my house.<br> But, Agnes, he's my brother.<br> Don't you have any pride?<br> After he comes here and<br> deliberately humiliates you?<br> And that...<br> All that slop he wrote<br> about me in his book.<br> It was nasty and malicious and...<br> Why do you keep insisting<br> he was writing about you?<br> Agnes, it was just a<br> novel, for Pete's sake.<br> Nobody read it. It's forgotten.<br> Agnes.<br> What's the sense of arguing? I've<br> already invited him. He's coming.<br> Well, then, don't<br> expect to find me here.<br> I'll take Dawn and<br> we'll eat at the club.<br> I... Frank, no...<br> Frank, I refuse to<br> discuss it any further.<br> This isn't like you, dear. A brother.<br> Do you suppose people won't<br> notice how we treat him?<br> Do you think they won't<br> talk? Please, sweet...<br> Now, wait a minute. Let's be fair.<br> Did I say anything when that<br> sponging cousin of yours was here?<br> Smoking my best cigars?<br> Eating like a pig? Did I?<br> Agnes.<br> Hello, Joe. I saw Milly yesterday,<br> she said to be remembered to you.<br> David. David Hirsh. See you later.<br> You don't remember me, do you?<br> Jane Barclay, I used to have the<br> candy store down on Chester Street.<br> Oh, of course, sure.<br> That was where a kid could get a stick<br> of licorice on credit if he needed it bad.<br> Oh, yeah. That's why I'm<br> doing housework today.<br> And you know who I'm working<br> for? Your brother, Frank.<br> He sure hit the jackpot, that man.<br> My daughter even works as<br> his private secretary...<br> ...and he treats her like<br> she was part of the family.<br> - Is that good?<br> - Well, sure.<br> Say, you wanna do me a favor? Forget<br> you saw me coming out of Smitty's.<br> You know, I stopped<br> in for a quick beer.<br> - You like another one?<br> - To tell you the truth, I would...<br> ...but no, thanks, I gotta go.<br> I must say, you sure turned<br> into a clean-cut fella, Dave.<br> - I mean, Mr. Hirsh.<br> - Still Dave.<br> Thank you, Dave.<br> - And thanks for the licorice.<br> - Aw, don't mention it. Don't mention it.<br> What do you want me to do, lose<br> my license? Go to the liquor store.<br> Now, take it easy, man. I<br> told you I was 21 last week.<br> Oh, congratulations.<br> Now, stop bothering me.<br> Straight.<br> Say, pal, will you get it for me?<br> Pint of Old Eagle up there.<br> Very cool date tonight.<br> Real nice stuff.<br> Anybody ever tell you whiskey's a man's<br> drink? Why don't you run home to Mama?<br> Aw, these kids today.<br> Dumb. At his age, I never<br> had any trouble getting fried.<br> Let me buy you a drink, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Go ahead, pour yourself another.<br> How'd you know who I was?<br> Oh, I heard you were in town, uniform.<br> Sort of a family resemblance.<br> Now, no offense meant.<br> You know my brother?<br> Well, he don't send<br> me no Christmas cards.<br> Um, I'm Bama Dillert.<br> - What can I do for you, Mr. Dillert?<br> - Nothing.<br> I'm just here to welcome you<br> to Smitty's cocktail hour.<br> You sort of stuck the needle<br> in old Frank where it hurts.<br> You know, putting your money<br> in a bank that he ain't with.<br> - News sure gets around fast here.<br> - About the only thing in town that does.<br> Do you play any cards, Mr. Hirsh?<br> Some, why?<br> Well, it's just a few<br> of the boys and myself...<br> ...we have a poker game now and then.<br> We'd kind of like to<br> have a little new blood.<br> - And new<br> money. - Mm-hm.<br> You don't mince words.<br> Well, I try not to.<br> But you gotta remember now, we're<br> just little old country boys.<br> We don't know the finer<br> points of the game.<br> But we aiming to learn.<br> And you know, you can always learn<br> from a fella that saves his money.<br> I won that dough from several guys.<br> Well, that's even smarter yet.<br> Case you're interested, we're having a<br> game here tonight in Smitty's backroom.<br> - I might just drop around, Mr. Dillert.<br> - Oh, I'll like that fine, Mr. Hirsh.<br> - Buy yourself a Quonset hut.<br> - Thanks.<br> Well, what can I show you, sir?<br> - Got something in nose rings?<br> - Hm?<br> Nothing too expensive. I know<br> a little kid in the Congo.<br> She gets restless.<br> Dave?<br> Yeah. Oh, come on in.<br> Just have to lock up the safe.<br> Be with you in a minute.<br> - It's a pretty fancy layout you got here.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> Oh, this is my<br> secretary, Miss Barclay.<br> This is my wandering brother, Dave.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Hirsh?<br> - Miss Barclay.<br> Well, all set.<br> Apres vous.<br> - Bye, Miss Barclay.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Here we are right here.<br> Well, we had a terrific<br> fight to push it through.<br> I'm on the City Appointing<br> Commission, as you know.<br> And for a while it<br> was touch-and-go.<br> It would mean a great deal to the<br> town. Should bring a lot of business.<br> That girl, uh, very attractive.<br> - What girl?<br> - Your secretary.<br> I never really noticed. I make it<br> a rule not to, uh... with employees.<br> If you're getting any<br> ideas, forget them.<br> She's strictly a nice girl.<br> - All girls are nice, brother.<br> - Yeah.<br> You'll get no argument from me there.<br> Oh, uh, this is a funny question<br> to be asking your own brother...<br> ...but you're not married, are you?<br> - Nope.<br> - Well. Guess we'll have to find you a girl.<br> Swell. Tonight soon enough?<br> Made up your mind what you're gonna<br> do now that you're out of the Army?<br> - Sure. Never to go in it again.<br> - Hm.<br> Lot of opportunities in<br> a small town, Davey...<br> ...but me, if I was<br> starting out today...<br> ...I'd head for one of<br> the metropolitan centers.<br> More room at the top.<br> - You hinting I leave here?<br> - No, no, no, Davey boy.<br> What I meant was that a man<br> ought to pick his spot...<br> ...not go wandering<br> all over the world.<br> - Isn't that what they told Columbus? -<br> Yeah. Ha-ha-ha! And he never died rich.<br> Well.<br> - Home sweet home.<br> - Holy.<br> It's the old Carmichael place.<br> Yeah. We fixed it up a little.<br> I guess Agnes must be taking<br> all of this pretty big, huh?<br> Oh! Oh. I meant to tell you...<br> ...she's on this women's committee<br> for the Parkman Centennial.<br> They're having a dinner<br> meeting tonight, and, uh...<br> You mean, uh, Agnes<br> is not gonna be here?<br> Well, she did her best to make it,<br> but you know how these things are.<br> Such short notice. She<br> was real broke up about it.<br> - Oh, yes. I can see where she would be.<br> - Mm.<br> Dave.<br> This is quite a surprise.<br> Yeah, for me too.<br> Well, still the same handsome rascal.<br> Why can't you keep your figure, Poppy?<br> Oh, well, I'd have had<br> a flat stomach too...<br> ...if I didn't have such flat feet.<br> You haven't changed a bit, Agnes.<br> Oh, what a liar. Come on in.<br> And tell us everything<br> that's happened to you.<br> Am I keeping you from your meeting?<br> Oh, that committee meeting. I<br> was just telling Dave about it.<br> Oh, that. No, they'll just<br> have to manage without me.<br> Where's Dawn? Wait till you<br> get a look at your niece, Dave.<br> You can tell how he hates that girl.<br> - Dawn. Yes?<br> Dawnie?<br> Dawn. Well, here's your Uncle Dave.<br> Well, kiss him. He's your uncle.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I wouldn't have recognized him.<br> He doesn't look at all like Daddy.<br> I hardly know you.<br> Last time I saw you, you were<br> stark naked in your bathtub.<br> Oh, Dave, you rascal,<br> you're making her blush.<br> - Not me.<br> - Come on in, Dave.<br> Why didn't you let me<br> know you changed your mind?<br> Shh!<br> Gee, I wish I didn't<br> have a date tonight, Dave.<br> I tried to break it,<br> but this boy isn't home.<br> Sweetie, nobody ever broke<br> a date to be with her uncle.<br> She's going out again<br> on a school night?<br> - Just to an early movie.<br> - But it's with Wally.<br> Oh, oh, oh, real nice boy.<br> Now, don't you keep him<br> up too late, understand?<br> I'll bet Dave would like a drink.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Of course he'd like<br> one. Will you fix them?<br> Orders from headquarters.<br> Oh, you want one too, Mama?<br> Oh, maybe just one. It is<br> a rather special occasion.<br> I hope you like Manhattans, Dave.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Poppy's famous for his<br> Manhattans. Only, one's my limit.<br> Oh, not tonight. Tonight,<br> you're among friends.<br> Oh, now, Poppy, you've<br> got to promise...<br> ...not to let me have<br> more than one drink.<br> I get giggly.<br> I like my girls giggly.<br> Dave, you remember Robert Haven French<br> and his daughter Gwen, don't you?<br> - I don't think so.<br> They're on the faculty...<br> ...at Parkman College.<br> They're coming to pick us up.<br> - We're going to the club for dinner.<br> - The Frenches?<br> Yes, they called as soon as<br> they heard Dave was in town.<br> Gwen French couldn't have been<br> more flattering. She's, uh...<br> - What does she teach, Dawnie?<br> - Creative writing and criticism.<br> That's it. She says she's<br> read every word you've written.<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, Agnes, the literary<br> crowd gives me a pain.<br> I quit writing. Look, can't<br> we do this another night?<br> - Would you mind?<br> - Why, don't be silly. Of course I mind.<br> We've waited too long to<br> have an evening with you.<br> The Frenches are well worth meeting.<br> They're really an old family.<br> - Oh, Poppy, how about those drinks?<br> - Oh, the boss wants service.<br> - Mama, will you give me a hand?<br> - Bob French owns all that land...<br> ...between the river and the reservoir.<br> They're really wonderful people.<br> You might have told me<br> the Frenches were coming.<br> Agnes.<br> You're lucky I'm even speaking to you.<br> I envy you, Dave.<br> You do? Why?<br> Well, you left home on your<br> own before you were my age...<br> ...lived your own<br> life, had experiences.<br> Girl couldn't do that.<br> Why would she want to?<br> Bumming around, doing all sorts of jobs.<br> Didn't that help to make you a writer?<br> Dawn, honey...<br> ...bumming around can<br> only help make you a bum.<br> Well, well, well, the<br> old hearth and fireside.<br> Family all together. Nothing<br> like it, eh, Davey boy?<br> Mm-mm. Nothing.<br> That's Wally.<br> Now what we've got to do is<br> to get you settled down, Davey.<br> Put your money to work. I wanna<br> see you save some real dough.<br> - Wally boy, how are you?<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> Hello, Wally.<br> - Mrs. Hirsh.<br> Wally, this is my Uncle Dave.<br> Wally Dennis.<br> Uh, how are you, sir?<br> - Not bad.<br> - That's fine. Fine.<br> Haven't we met before?<br> I don't remember, sir.<br> - L, uh... You ready, Dawn? One sec.<br> - Good night, Dave.<br> - Good night, kid.<br> - Will I see you before you go?<br> - I don't see why not.<br> Oh, that'll be the Frenches.<br> Good night.<br> Ahem. Good night, sir.<br> Say, you'll get a big<br> kick out of old Bob French.<br> Dawnie, Wally.<br> Bob, how are you? Let<br> me have your hat here.<br> Dave, I don't suppose you<br> remember Professor French?<br> I do. I caddied for him and he<br> never gave me less than a dollar.<br> Wasn't that to keep you<br> quiet about my score?<br> - And I kept quiet.<br> - Thanks.<br> Oh, uh, you remember my daughter Gwen?<br> - Hello.<br> - Oh, I'm sure he doesn't remember me.<br> I was a few grades behind<br> you in grammar school.<br> I'm an admirer of yours, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Until people know<br> me, they usually are.<br> Oh, I meant as a writer.<br> That's why I wanted to meet you.<br> But I'm not a writer. I<br> haven't been for years.<br> Well, I'm not sure I agree with you.<br> The fact that an author is inactive...<br> ...that doesn't necessarily<br> mean he isn't an author.<br> Exactly what it does mean?<br> I suppose it could mean<br> he should get back to work.<br> I'm told that you<br> teach creative writing.<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Would you like to teach me?<br> She needs that. Give her more.<br> I'm afraid my courses are filled<br> for this semester. Perhaps next year.<br> Say, are you folks ready<br> for some elbow-bending?<br> I am. -<br> Elbow-bending.<br> He's used to talking down<br> to traveling salesmen.<br> - Sweetheart, our guests are<br> intellectuals. What are intellectuals?<br> Underpaid.<br> No, thanks.<br> Did you suppose this costume<br> will be all right at your club?<br> Why not? It's the<br> uniform of your country.<br> A toast. A toast.<br> Let's drink to the return<br> of the conquering hero.<br> When was the last time<br> you had it? In Dijon.<br> That's the first time I ever danced with<br> a teacher of creative writing. I like it.<br> Well, look, isn't the table this way?<br> Yeah, it is, but I thought<br> we might go to the bar.<br> - Do you mind?<br> - Not at all.<br> Frank, I like your brother.<br> Oh, he's a fine boy.<br> Glad to have him home.<br> Yes, we're hoping he'll stay.<br> You know, it isn't<br> immediately apparent...<br> ...but he's an<br> extremely sensitive man.<br> - He sure is.<br> - It must be a family trait.<br> Frank is like that.<br> Terribly sensitive.<br> Sir.<br> You know, I've watched every step of<br> your career with a great deal of interest.<br> You must have a lot of spare time.<br> I could tell from your stories where<br> you were and what you were doing.<br> I remember when you were<br> working on that freighter.<br> And when you were<br> working in the oil fields.<br> No.<br> Then I think it was in<br> Oh, the suspense is<br> killing me. Don't stop now.<br> Seriously, your first novel was more<br> or less autobiographical, wasn't it?<br> - I thought it was more or less lousy.<br> - Well, that isn't so.<br> It might have lacked<br> something in craftsmanship...<br> ...but it's a really<br> powerful study of rejection.<br> Oh, that it was. It was<br> rejected by 42 publishers...<br> ...and almost all of the<br> English-reading public.<br> Now, look, I told you once<br> before, I'm not a writer.<br> You have two books in<br> the Parkman Library.<br> And those two books have<br> netted me exactly $48.<br> - No personal satisfaction? -<br> Forty-eight dollars' worth. Sir.<br> - Still brandy?<br> - No more for me, thank you.<br> - Straight Scotch. Yes, sir.<br> I don't believe that talent can be<br> turned off as though it were a faucet.<br> - Make that a triple, will you?<br> - Do you always drink this much?<br> Only when I have money.<br> I'll just have this one...<br> ...and then we'll get<br> into action again, huh?<br> Well, I'd rather talk, unless<br> dancing is one of your passions.<br> No, my passions are<br> pretty conventional.<br> - When I spoke of your talent, I was...<br> - You overlooked one thing.<br> A little talent to a writer...<br> ...means just about as much as a<br> little talent to a brain surgeon.<br> You underrate yourself. Your second<br> novel was the best book I've ever read.<br> - Miss French.<br> - Yes?<br> Why don't we get out of<br> here and go someplace?<br> Or would your father object?<br> I would.<br> We should get back. I had<br> no idea it was so late.<br> Gwen, no kidding. Let's get<br> away for a couple of hours.<br> What did you have in mind?<br> Since you were so<br> interested in my writing...<br> ...I thought you'd come<br> to the hotel with me.<br> I have a story there that's incomplete.<br> I thought you might like to see it.<br> Mr. Hirsh, if you have a story,<br> I'd very much like to see it.<br> Why don't you bring it out to the<br> house? Any time, our door's never locked.<br> I may not be here too long.<br> Don't get up. We haven't seen you two.<br> Agnes, I'm sorry, I have to leave.<br> I still have papers to correct.<br> Oh, what a shame. Say,<br> could you drop me off?<br> Well, my fa...<br> - I think I'll stay a little while longer.<br> - Frank could drop me.<br> - Sure, sure.<br> All right. Good night<br> and thank you. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Where do you want me to drop you?<br> - I don't.<br> - I must. I really do have papers to correct.<br> I like the way you do your hair.<br> I have a feeling you're running away<br> from something. Or after something.<br> Of course, you'd have to know which it<br> is before you could discover what it is.<br> You also got fascinating eyes.<br> I have a theory that writers<br> create to compensate...<br> ...for some lack in<br> their personal lives.<br> That's because we<br> need to be stimulated.<br> - That smells good. What is it?<br> - It's a bug repellent. Do you like it?<br> Mr. Hirsh, I know my<br> eyes are not fascinating.<br> I wear my hair this way<br> to please the school board.<br> If you wanna flatter me, I've<br> only one good feature: my mind.<br> You'd be on safer ground.<br> Who wants to be on safer ground?<br> Where should we go?<br> When I suggested there might<br> be a lack in your life...<br> ...I wasn't offering<br> myself as compensation.<br> No, but that's a peachy idea.<br> Why don't we just go park<br> somewhere and talk it over?<br> Mr. Hirsh, do I look like<br> a delinquent teenager?<br> No, you don't, teacher.<br> - Who's the man in your life?<br> - What man?<br> Oh, I just assumed there must be<br> one. Or is it just no interest in me?<br> Well, you know I have an<br> interest in you. In your talent.<br> I mean that. I wish I could<br> influence you to start writing again.<br> Good, then we'd become pen pals.<br> Well, I would like to...<br> I started to say "stimulate you. "<br> But I would like to help you if you<br> decide to start writing. I'm a good critic.<br> Would you mind dropping<br> me at the corner?<br> On my head, please.<br> Thanks for the lift and the analysis.<br> - Good night, Dave Hirsh.<br> - Good night, teacher.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello there.<br> - I didn't leave.<br> - I believe you.<br> - Beat it, soldier.<br> Oh, sit down, will you, stupid?<br> This is Raymond Lanchak<br> from Chicago. Remember him?<br> You know what? He followed<br> me all the way from there.<br> - How are you, pal?<br> - Keep moving.<br> Your friend's got bad manners.<br> Look, you slugged me in<br> Chicago when I wasn't looking.<br> Now, blow, or I'll wipe<br> the floor with your uniform.<br> Not only would that be<br> unpatriotic, but you might get hurt.<br> - I'm just reminding you this is my girl.<br> - Are you?<br> Raymond, will you please cut it out?<br> I'm not his girl. I'm not his anything.<br> He bought me a couple of drinks.<br> - Yeah, what about the coat?<br> - You want it back?<br> Pay no attention to him, Dave. Like<br> I told you, he's just a big pest.<br> I can go out with anybody I want to.<br> In that case, you stick<br> around. I'll see you later.<br> Look, if you want my advice...<br> I don't.<br> Look, Ginnie, I don't want no trouble.<br> There's a bus leaving at 11:10.<br> - Lots of luck. I hope you get a seat.<br> - I'm telling you again.<br> - Don't fool around, you understand?<br> - Will you do me one favor? Go home.<br> Cards, pair of deuces.<br> Possible straight.<br> Ace of diamonds. Ace of spades.<br> Seven of clubs. Deuces bet.<br> Oh, pair of deuces<br> is gonna bet just $2.<br> Call. I'll stay.<br> Well, here's where I<br> find out if I'm yellow.<br> Are you?<br> I'm yellow.<br> I'll play. Cards.<br> - Three deuces.<br> - How about that?<br> Ain't that a kick in the head?<br> Noting. Nothing.<br> Pair of sixes.<br> Three deuces makes a bet.<br> Well, since you're all my<br> friends, I'm just gonna bet, uh...<br> ...$25.<br> - Oh, he's being charming. Beats me.<br> I've had it.<br> You say the limit is, uh...?<br> Well, don't you worry<br> about the limit, Dave.<br> You just go ahead and make your<br> own limit. Bet anything you like.<br> All right, I'm gonna see that bet.<br> I owe you 25 plus 150.<br> Oh-ho!<br> Could have a third six, you know.<br> Possible. Mm-hm.<br> Hundred and fifty, and...<br> You know what "and" is?<br> - Yeah, I got it.<br> - And a hundred and fifty.<br> Hey, that's a mighty sweet pot.<br> Too rich for me.<br> I think it could use more sugar.<br> You said anything, didn't you?<br> Anything at all.<br> I owe you 150 plus 500.<br> I'm topping at 500, Mr. Dillert.<br> Oh, that makes a real<br> nice pot, don't it?<br> Sure does.<br> Fellas, I think he's<br> got the third six.<br> Now, there's a clever<br> poker player, I say.<br> - All yours, Dave.<br> - Your deal, Bama.<br> Hey, fellas, wrap it up, will you?<br> The sheriff just came in. You<br> never can tell about that guy.<br> Well, if the sheriff would have got here<br> sooner, I'd have been a much richer man.<br> That's the way she goes.<br> Dave, you handle yourself pretty good.<br> Tell me something, Bama.<br> How'd an old pro like you find<br> your way to a hole like this?<br> Me? Oh, I was just<br> driving through town.<br> Had a flat, had to stop.<br> - Car in front of me<br> hit a train. - Mm-hm.<br> It could have been me.<br> So I figured something<br> wanted me to stay in Parkman.<br> And you know, I've been<br> doing all right here.<br> I believe you are.<br> How about a little relaxation?<br> You know these dames?<br> Well, who don't? That's the night<br> shift from the brassiere factory.<br> Hey, Rosalie.<br> Hi, handsome. Come here, honey.<br> I'll be right back.<br> She got a friend. A<br> pig, but not too bad.<br> - Rosalie, honey, say hello to Dave.<br> - Hi, how are you?<br> Hi, baby.<br> - Sit down, hon.<br> Come on, join us.<br> Oh, uh, excuse me, I think<br> I see one of my own friends.<br> - How about a drink?<br> - I'd love one.<br> Hello there, Miss Chicago.<br> Well, I didn't think when you told me<br> to stick around you meant half the night.<br> - Where's lover boy?<br> - Who, Raymond?<br> He went to get a room.<br> You know, he actually thinks I'm<br> gonna meet him there. Ha-ha-ha!<br> Boy, is that the creep<br> in for a big surprise.<br> Hey, Smitty. Yeah?<br> You know...<br> ...I don't want you jumping to no<br> conclusions about me and Raymond.<br> You know, just because a person<br> carries a torch for a person...<br> ...that don't mean<br> that the two of them...<br> - You know what I mean.<br> - Oh, I do. I do.<br> Actually, he's one of the reasons why I<br> was kind of glad to get out of Chicago.<br> - Wanna know the other one?<br> - What?<br> - I really shouldn't tell you.<br> - You don't have to tell me.<br> It's because I think I could<br> fall for a guy like you.<br> Me?<br> A cute-looking kid like<br> you? With such class?<br> With such a fine mind?<br> Oh, get out. You're pulling my leg.<br> How many drinks you had, Dave?<br> I had a few, why?<br> You know the only time you talk<br> nice to me is when you're loaded?<br> Let's get loaded.<br> Here.<br> Compared to this morning, I<br> do look pretty good, though.<br> - You look fine.<br> - I had a wave and a shampoo.<br> In the barber shop. Only cost a<br> dollar. They did a pretty good job.<br> Yeah. Say, speaking of jobs, don't<br> you have to get back to yours?<br> Oh, the job I got I can always get.<br> I work in a... You know, club.<br> It's sort of a hostess.<br> Oh, I'll bet that's a fine,<br> intelligent and interesting job.<br> It really is.<br> The only thing, though...<br> ...I drink too much, and the first<br> thing you know, you get bloated.<br> Well, life fluctuates, you know.<br> Yeah.<br> Like I was saying, what I<br> really wanna do is modeling.<br> But you gotta have<br> a figure like a boy.<br> Yeah. And that you haven't got.<br> You all mind if we join you?<br> Oh, back it right in here.<br> Come in here. Come on.<br> Ain't you gonna introduce<br> us? I'm Ginnie Moorehead.<br> I'm terribly sorry. This is Bama<br> Dillert, and this here is Rosalie.<br> Hi. Ginnie.<br> Does he wear his hat in<br> the presence of ladies?<br> - All the time.<br> - He even sleeps in his hat.<br> I'll bet.<br> That's a fact.<br> - What's the idea?<br> - Well, I got a theory.<br> I learned a little while back that certain<br> conditions bring a gambler luck, you know?<br> And... Oh, thank you. And<br> this here hat's one of them.<br> Every time I take this hat<br> off, something bad happens.<br> I ain't about to have<br> that happen again.<br> Yeah. You know, I felt the exact<br> same way about a black cat I had once.<br> And I never once let it sleep with me.<br> How about that?<br> I've been waiting.<br> Keep on waiting, Raymond.<br> - Come on.<br> - Will you take your paws off me?<br> - All right, steady, pal, get out of here.<br> - I'm talking to her.<br> Now, why don't you do what he says?<br> You're making a big mistake, buddy.<br> Sure, sure.<br> Oh, he's such a weirdie.<br> You know something?<br> He followed me here all<br> the way from Chicago.<br> What for?<br> - Aren't men terrible?<br> - Ain't they, though?<br> - Look, let's drink up and all go to my place.<br> - What's doing there?<br> - Let's get over there and<br> find out. I'll go pay the check.<br> - Smitty. Yeah?<br> What do I owe you here? Uh, 2 dollars.<br> Ain't they coming?<br> - Yeah, it's a pretty<br> night, ain't it? Yeah.<br> Let's get some air, huh?<br> Raymond!<br> Oh!<br> If I wasn't so tired,<br> I'd kick your teeth in.<br> Call the cops! Call the cops!<br> Oh, getting a little<br> exercise, huh, Dave?<br> Come on, let's get<br> in the car. Come on.<br> In the car here.<br> - Oh, hi, Sherm. Hello, Bama.<br> Somebody been fighting?<br> - Yeah, but it's all over.<br> - I'm afraid that's impossible.<br> - You start this?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> He did. He started it in Chicago.<br> You've got a lot of nerve. I<br> can tell you who started this.<br> - Don't tell me, tell the<br> judge. It was nothing at all.<br> - Look, there's been a<br> formal complaint. Why me?<br> - All I did was get a working<br> -over. I can give you my word.<br> I know this gentleman.<br> He's a no-good, dirty louse.<br> - He came at my friend here with a bottle.<br> - Looks like they both had a bottle.<br> - Come on.<br> - Listen, will you listen to me? I'm a witness.<br> Well, so you're a witness. Maybe<br> you better come along too. Go on.<br> Welcome home, Dave.<br> Dave, don't worry about a<br> thing, I'll be right with you.<br> Come in.<br> Good morning, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Or is it good afternoon?<br> Is my brother here?<br> - Oh, my new boarder? He sure is.<br> - Right in there.<br> - Thank you.<br> Door's open. I reckon<br> he needs a little air.<br> If you could just see yourself.<br> A good morning to you, sir.<br> That was nice going, Dave.<br> I'm real proud of you.<br> One day in town, just one day...<br> ...and you're picked up in a drunken<br> brawl with a floozy and tossed into jail...<br> ...like a common hoodlum.<br> - I know all about it, Frank.<br> - I just don't understand you.<br> - Is that your problem for this morning?<br> - What have you got against me?<br> - Not a thing.<br> Oh, yes, you have. I<br> take you to my home...<br> ...I introduce you to the best<br> people in town, like the Frenches.<br> And this is the thanks I get.<br> You seem to resent my position.<br> It's no crime to be successful.<br> I've worked hard for everything<br> I've got. Nobody's helped me.<br> Is this gonna be another<br> one of those long lectures?<br> Oh, I might have known.<br> Frank, I'm not trying to needle you.<br> I don't feel well. I got a<br> headache and I have to be in court.<br> You won't have to be in<br> court. I've squared it.<br> And that mobster friend of<br> yours has already skipped town.<br> - You both forfeit bail.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> I didn't do it for you, Dave.<br> I'm raising a decent girl.<br> That she is. She's a fine girl.<br> And I told the judge<br> you'll be leaving town.<br> Did you tell him where I was going?<br> How do I know where you're going?<br> - How did you know I was leaving?<br> - Aren't you?<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> I wish I could say I was sorry, Dave.<br> I wish you could say so too.<br> Well, I suppose it'll be in all the<br> afternoon papers. That's all I need.<br> Just when my name was beginning<br> to amount to something.<br> How could you do this to me?<br> Me, me, me.<br> Don't you ever get tired of thinking<br> about your dull, greedy, small self?<br> Now, get out of here. I'm tired of<br> listening to you. Get the hell out of here.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Man, you sure don't look<br> pretty this morning, Dave. Wow.<br> You know what I don't figure?<br> You drink three drinks to my one and<br> you look like a milk-fed quarterback.<br> Well, now, that all depends<br> on what a man's cut out for.<br> I can drink and you can write.<br> Oh, I know about them two books.<br> - Hey, Bama?<br> - Yeah?<br> Looks like something died back here.<br> Oh, no. That's Ginnie's<br> neck fur, you know?<br> That's an old female trick. They leave<br> something so they can come back for it.<br> Ain't you about due in<br> court? You better take my car.<br> No, I don't have to go to court.<br> My generous brother squared me.<br> But I could use your car, I'd like to<br> get... Run downtown and buy some clothes.<br> Any time at all, old buddy.<br> Hey, Dave, uh...<br> ...how would you like to make a pretty<br> nice living without too much trouble?<br> - Doing what?<br> - Well, team up with me.<br> I think we could get along.<br> - You mean gambling?<br> - Sure. It's a nice profession.<br> And you're pretty good at it.<br> No, I'm just lucky.<br> Name me one thing you ain't<br> supposed to be lucky at in life.<br> You take my old man.<br> He used to gamble when he was plowing<br> up his fields, hoping for a crop.<br> Sometimes he'd get one,<br> sometimes he wouldn't.<br> So I figure if a man's gonna gamble,<br> he might as well do it without plowing.<br> No, I'm not gonna stick<br> around here anyway.<br> And besides, how can you get any<br> real action in a dump like Parkman?<br> Oh, this is just my headquarters. I<br> make all these big towns around here.<br> It's a good idea, Dave. Then<br> you'd have a lot of time to write.<br> Why don't you think it over?<br> I just did.<br> Get that.<br> Hi. Golly, I hope I'm not<br> breaking in on nothing.<br> It's right in here.<br> Oh. Thank you. They told me<br> we don't have to go to court.<br> That's right.<br> Uh, I got some good news<br> too, Dave. You wanna hear it?<br> I got a job here in town at the<br> brassiere factory. Are you glad?<br> I'm ecstatic.<br> Honestly, Dave, every time you don't have<br> a couple of drinks, you get mad at me.<br> Last night and in Chicago, you<br> just couldn't have been sweeter.<br> And now, all of a sudden,<br> you're acting like this.<br> Honey, I'm not really mad. L...<br> - I was just clowning. Couldn't you tell?<br> - Of course you were.<br> You've gotta run along now because<br> I've got a couple of things to do, okay?<br> Good luck in your new career.<br> Thanks.<br> I don't know what it<br> is about them pigs...<br> ...but they always<br> look better at night.<br> Yeah.<br> Is that some of your writing?<br> Yeah, if you choose to call it that.<br> Dave.<br> What a pleasant surprise.<br> - I was just driving by and I thought...<br> - Come in. Come in.<br> Gwen, dear.<br> It's Dave Hirsh.<br> That's a Canaletto. I don't<br> know one painter from another...<br> ...but when I mention that<br> name, people are impressed.<br> Hello, Dave Hirsh.<br> How very nice.<br> - I hope I'm not interrupting.<br> - No, we're glad you're here.<br> Let's go in the kitchen.<br> It's our nicest room.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Dad insists on keeping books in here.<br> The grease from the cooking is<br> gonna ruin them. He's very obstinate.<br> - I heard that.<br> - Well, where are you going?<br> Larry Channock is having some faculty<br> men over for his watered-down cocktails.<br> - Didn't I tell you? No.<br> I'll be quite late, Gwen dear.<br> Larry expects me for dinner,<br> and you know his price. Cribbage.<br> Well, drive carefully.<br> Oh, Dave, there are plenty of extra<br> rooms if you wanna stay all night.<br> - I'll show you the grounds in the<br> morning. I'll show him the grounds.<br> But of course, we'd<br> love to have you stay.<br> I wish I could.<br> Uh, if you should decide on martinis,<br> the vermouth's on the lower shelf.<br> Goodbye, Dave. Hope to see you often.<br> Goodbye, professor.<br> Would you like a martini?<br> No, I don't believe I'll have<br> any. But you go right ahead.<br> I'm having coffee. It's fresh and hot.<br> Coffee will be fine.<br> Tell me something...<br> Just sugar, please.<br> What were you about to say?<br> Nothing much, except that you acted as<br> though you didn't wanna be alone with me.<br> How perfectly absurd.<br> What on earth led to that?<br> Because you seemed terribly disturbed<br> when your father was leaving.<br> I was just a little annoyed with him.<br> Poor darling. The only time he's awkward...<br> ...is when he's scheming to<br> leave me with someone he likes.<br> He's convinced himself<br> I haven't enough friends.<br> - Have you?<br> - No one has enough friends.<br> Excuse me.<br> - I guess you heard about my trouble, huh?<br> - Oh, several versions. It's a small town.<br> I hear there's a blow-by-blow<br> account in the afternoon paper.<br> There sure is.<br> Have a peek.<br> "Dave Hirsh home, is jailed<br> after fight over woman. "<br> Were you victorious?<br> - Drunk.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Well, that would have been my guess.<br> Were you shocked?<br> Would you expect me to be?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, I'm not shocked, Dave Hirsh.<br> But I'm not indifferent either.<br> I hate to see a writer's energy<br> wasted in drinking, fighting.<br> Any man as gifted as you are...<br> I brought you that story<br> that I was telling you about.<br> From the looks of it, it's not<br> exactly hot off the typewriter.<br> You got it right.<br> I did that some time ago and<br> I never could work it out...<br> ...till you showed some interest.<br> Well, what made you go back to<br> it? My interest in your work?<br> My interest in you. I think<br> I'm falling in love with you.<br> You fool. You must be a<br> writer, you're such a fool.<br> I meant that.<br> Now, let's understand one thing, Dave.<br> I told you if I could help you with<br> your work, the door's never locked.<br> Don't you think we ought to lock it?<br> Drink your coffee.<br> Apparently, you didn't hear what<br> I said. I'm in love with you.<br> And I was avoiding the obvious<br> comment that you said that...<br> ...with the ease of a man who's said<br> it often to an assortment of women.<br> - That's not true.<br> - Shall we read your press notices?<br> They got it all wrong, Gwen.<br> I'd much rather discuss<br> your story. What's it about?<br> It's about love.<br> And I think I've learned a<br> great deal more about it now.<br> Please, please don't.<br> Now, you sit down and let me clear away<br> these papers and then I'll read your story.<br> You correct papers<br> every night in the week?<br> Practically.<br> - Go on any dates?<br> - Rarely.<br> How old are you, Gwen?<br> I have a question, Dave Hirsh.<br> - Do you like my dad?<br> - I do.<br> You have a friendly relationship<br> with him, haven't you?<br> Very friendly.<br> Then why can't you have the same kind of<br> relationship with an intelligent woman?<br> Boy, I'm glad you're<br> not a teacher of biology.<br> And if I were, I wouldn't<br> confuse biology with love.<br> Well, let's walk on the grounds<br> and I'll read your story.<br> Hey. When you get finished with<br> the pages, they'll make nice arrows.<br> - We can shoot them across the river.<br> - Quiet.<br> Your girl went that way.<br> Dave. Dave.<br> It's that bad, huh?<br> Dave, you have a very exciting talent.<br> - You mean you liked some of that stuff?<br> - I liked all of it.<br> The people are so real, so touching.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - It's a lovely story, Dave.<br> I cried, and I don't often.<br> Well...<br> ...maybe I'll try to finish it.<br> - But it's finished.<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> Well, the minute the girl<br> leaves, the story's over.<br> There's nothing more to say.<br> That's why you couldn't go on.<br> Of course. How about that? How<br> come I never thought about that?<br> I'll have it retyped and send it to The<br> Atlantic. I'm pretty certain they'll want it.<br> So help me, I didn't know<br> there were women like you.<br> Dave, I have just a<br> minor suggestion to make.<br> - I'll show you what I mean.<br> - First, a thank-you kiss.<br> One hundred percent<br> platonic, wasn't it?<br> - About 75.<br> - Oh, I can do better than that.<br> Oh, Dave, let's talk about the story.<br> Don't. Don't, Dave.<br> Gwen.<br> Gwen, I truly love you.<br> Don't you know that?<br> Don't.<br> Don't.<br> And David Hirsh,<br> brother of Frank Hirsh...<br> ...forfeited $ 100<br> bail when he and a...<br> There it goes again.<br> Every hour on the hour.<br> Well, we don't have to listen.<br> ...to answer charges of<br> disturbing the peace...<br> How long are you gonna let<br> your brother disgrace us?<br> Oh, now, what can I do?<br> Sweetheart, let's drop it, huh?<br> I've had a tough day.<br> What kind of a day do you think I've had?<br> The whole town talking about this... This...<br> I've never been so humiliated.<br> Next they'll ask us...<br> ...to resign from the country club.<br> - Oh, nobody's gonna ask us to resign.<br> Lots of families have black sheep.<br> Besides, you married<br> me, not my brother.<br> You know something?<br> You're still the<br> prettiest girl in Parkman.<br> Of course, there's a<br> little more of you...<br> ...but that just means<br> there's a little more to love.<br> What do you say we go out?<br> Sort of relax, huh?<br> - What do you say?<br> - Don't be silly, Frank. I've got a headache.<br> - Good night, Daddy.<br> - Good night?<br> Good night, Mom. Don't<br> worry, I've got a key.<br> - Say, where's she going?<br> - Out.<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> Do you mind telling me where<br> she's going and who with?<br> I don't know.<br> What do you mean you don't know?<br> You're her mother, aren't you? Dawn.<br> If it isn't too much trouble, would<br> you mind telling me where you're going?<br> Oh, just for a drive with Wally.<br> If it was anything special,<br> you know I'd tell you.<br> - There he is. Satisfied?<br> If I ran my business the way you<br> run this house, we'd be bankrupt.<br> Your business? You seem to<br> forget it was my father's store.<br> Forget? How can I forget?<br> You've been reminding me<br> twice a day for 18 years.<br> I'm going out.<br> Oh, why, Mr. Hirsh,<br> you... You frightened me.<br> What are you doing here so late?<br> Oh, there...<br> There are a lot of back orders.<br> It's always quieter at night.<br> I don't like you working so<br> late. It doesn't look right.<br> I don't care what the<br> people think, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Besides, I'm almost through.<br> You're through right now, young lady.<br> Home you go.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, I suppose the night<br> must be just beginning for you.<br> - Oh, it's great to be young.<br> - So they tell me.<br> What's the trouble? Have a<br> fight with your boyfriend?<br> You mean Ed Remick?<br> Oh, I stopped seeing<br> him a long time ago.<br> - Young men can be<br> such bores. - Ho-ho!<br> There must be plenty of others<br> waiting to take his place.<br> - Aren't there?<br> - Sure, hundreds.<br> Edith, I hope you don't think I'm<br> being fresh or anything like that...<br> ...but I got the blues tonight.<br> I was just wondering if we<br> could drive around for a while.<br> Of course.<br> Beautiful night.<br> Mmm.<br> Oh, that feels good. My back's tired.<br> Ha-ha. No wonder, sitting behind<br> a desk all day, working at night.<br> You know, what I should do is take<br> you across my knee and paddle you.<br> Working's better than<br> sitting home alone.<br> You're an attractive girl,<br> you ought to have more fun.<br> All work and no play, you know.<br> Matter of fact, you're<br> an exceptional girl.<br> I've met lots in my time, and I know.<br> Take an old man's advice, Edith.<br> Have fun while you're young.<br> You're a long way from<br> being old, Mr. Hirsh.<br> Well, I'm older than I'd like to be.<br> Especially when I'm...<br> When I'm sitting next to an<br> attractive young girl like you.<br> Wally, please, let's go home.<br> I told you I don't wanna park.<br> It always leads to the<br> same old teachers' argument.<br> We don't have to have that argument.<br> You heard what I said.<br> What's the matter?<br> I... I will have that drink.<br> Sure.<br> No, I really don't want<br> it. Wally, take me home.<br> - Dawn.<br> - Please, Wally, take me home.<br> - Any calls?<br> - No, she didn't call.<br> Oh.<br> - I bought that car I was telling you about.<br> - Oh, good. Then you're fixing to stay, huh?<br> Got myself a steady boarder.<br> I don't expect to sign a lease.<br> Where are you going?<br> Terre Haute, Indianapolis.<br> For a little relaxation,<br> maybe a little profit.<br> You wanna come along?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> You know, the boys in Terre<br> Haute, they don't set no limit.<br> We could do ourselves a little good.<br> I think I'd better stay.<br> Dave, now, you ain't<br> acting like no grown-up man.<br> You wanna see your little<br> schoolteacher, don't you?<br> Why don't you get on<br> over and go see her?<br> She said she'd phone me.<br> Well, I don't pretend to<br> be no authority on dames...<br> ...but there's one<br> thing I sure do know.<br> They either take orders<br> or they give them.<br> And once they get an idea they're<br> running menfolks, they get mean on you.<br> And how have you been?<br> Well...<br> ...in case you change your mind about<br> the trip, I ain't leaving till midnight.<br> Dave.<br> Are you busy?<br> - I am, as a matter of fact, but come on in.<br> - I've missed you.<br> That's a very attractive jacket.<br> Gwen, you said you'd telephone.<br> Well, I've been swamped with<br> examination papers, Dave.<br> Would you like a drink?<br> Is it still coffee?<br> Nothing, thank you.<br> We should be hearing from The<br> Atlantic soon about your story.<br> Gwen.<br> What's the matter? You're acting<br> like you're 12 million miles away.<br> I don't know what happened. The last<br> time we were together, you seemed to...<br> I haven't forgotten.<br> I suppose you're sorry, huh?<br> Let's not talk about it, Dave.<br> I think we should talk about it.<br> You're a bright girl. This is<br> important to me. I'm in love with you.<br> I don't want you to be in<br> love with me. Don't be, please.<br> - That was a foolish thing to say, wasn't it?<br> - It was pretty foolish.<br> - Don't you understand what I'm trying to...?<br> - Please.<br> Dave, haven't I made it clear<br> I don't want this relationship?<br> Well, what kind of<br> relationship do you want?<br> Now, don't act like a little<br> boy who's been slapped.<br> You know how much I'm drawn to you<br> and how much I admire your talent.<br> Forget the talent, let's get to the<br> point. You don't love me, do you?<br> I think I do. I'm not sure I want to.<br> - Would you like to make that clearer?<br> - I'm not a schoolgirl, I'm a schoolteacher.<br> I've waited a long time.<br> You mustn't hurry me.<br> Your kind of violence,<br> it frightens me.<br> What are you afraid of?<br> Well, it... It isn't easy to<br> put these things into words.<br> Intellectually, I can understand and<br> even envy a little your way of living.<br> But emotionally...<br> Well, emotionally, I'm a<br> rather commonplace person.<br> Who isn't? Look, I've quit drinking.<br> I've changed. I know I haven't changed<br> to a hundred percent, but I have.<br> - Oh, Gwen.<br> - Dave.<br> Do you wanna marry me?<br> Is that curiosity or<br> a proposal of marriage?<br> No. It's just a question<br> that has only two answers.<br> There's also a third.<br> I don't know yet.<br> Oh, Dave, we've met exactly three<br> times. What do I know about you?<br> What do you know about me?<br> I just know that I'm the<br> kid who wants to marry you.<br> Gwen, it's something I want more<br> than anything else in the world.<br> We'll have no more of that. I'm<br> not one of your barroom tarts.<br> You're right, teacher. You're<br> a hundred percent right.<br> I've been a bad boy.<br> I've been naughty. Matter of fact,<br> I don't even belong in your class.<br> Quite possibly you don't.<br> Well, you won't get a<br> chance to flunk me again.<br> Bama. Bama?<br> Bama.<br> I told you it's her birthday.<br> I got a cake in the oven.<br> - Ain't you even gonna give us a drink?<br> - You know where it is.<br> Sure.<br> Oh, Dave. Whoo!<br> We thought you was never coming back.<br> - You got a roommate. When do we leave?<br> - Any time at all. Didn't make out so good?<br> - Let's get started.<br> - You going someplace?<br> Yep.<br> - Yep, Terre Haute. The party's over.<br> - Oh, take us, will you?<br> - Dave, please take us.<br> Oh, please, we can tell the<br> factory girls we've been sick.<br> - Please, Dave.<br> - Oh, come on, it's her birthday.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> Can we go? Can we?<br> Ooh!<br> Dave?<br> - It really ain't.<br> - What ain't?<br> It ain't my birthday.<br> I just said that.<br> - Why?<br> - Oh, you know, everybody does that.<br> Maybe have a little party,<br> get some perfume or something.<br> I shouldn't have said that<br> to you, though, Dave. L...<br> I really shouldn't have pulled a<br> thing like that on a fella like you.<br> Come on, help me pack.<br> Okay.<br> - These?<br> - No, they hurt.<br> Agnes, I don't know<br> what else we can do.<br> We've got to call<br> the sheriff's office.<br> And have it all over tomorrow's paper?<br> I don't want to either, but<br> do you realize what time it is?<br> Look, just what did Wally say?<br> I've told you three times. He hasn't<br> seen her. He doesn't know where she is.<br> I don't know what's<br> come over that girl.<br> - Ever since your brother got here...<br> - Will you stop it?<br> Say, you didn't have a fight<br> with her or anything, did you?<br> Now, why would I have a<br> fight with her? Honestly.<br> Hello? Oh, yeah.<br> - Fine, fine, fine.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Uh-huh. Yeah.<br> - Who is it?<br> Uh-huh.<br> Yes. Mm-hm.<br> - Frank.<br> - Excuse me a minute.<br> It's Edith, she's been making<br> phone calls. Dawn's okay.<br> She's been in Terre Haute. A friend<br> of Willy Packer's saw her there.<br> - Yes.<br> - And what's fine about it?<br> - What's she doing in Terre Haute?<br> - Please.<br> Uh-huh. Thank you. Thank<br> you very much, Edith.<br> I don't suppose you<br> can talk now, can you?<br> I understand. Good night, Frank.<br> Oh, yeah, baby. Easy. There, easy now.<br> Good, sit down. Easy.<br> - What happened to her?<br> - Good girl. You all right, honey?<br> - Yeah, you're all right.<br> - Cigarettes.<br> Okay. Smoke up, force<br> yourself to have fun.<br> That's a girl. Mmm!<br> There you go.<br> There we go.<br> Are you sure you don't<br> want me to check your hat?<br> What hat, lady?<br> Oh!<br> What? What's the matter?<br> Oh, Dave, it's that song.<br> I just love it. It's so sad.<br> - Bama, don't you think it's sad?<br> - Yeah, gets me right here, sweetheart.<br> There. All right? That's better?<br> - Beautiful voice, isn't it?<br> - She been studying, you know.<br> Yeah. Speak up. Beautiful?<br> Hey, buddy, get that<br> dame away from the band.<br> Shh.<br> Look, I don't want any trouble.<br> Are you gonna remove her or are we?<br> What do you mean, are we gonna...?<br> Dave, if there's gonna be an argument<br> about Ginnie's singing, I'm with him.<br> Yeah, I'm with him.<br> Who you with, baby?<br> Come on, baby, let's dance. They don't<br> appreciate your singing in this joint.<br> You appreciate my singing,<br> though, don't you, Dave?<br> I promised I'd never<br> ask you for nothing...<br> ...but just so as I'll have<br> a remembrance of this trip...<br> ...will you buy me one of<br> them pillows over there?<br> Sure I will. Come on.<br> Hey, lady.<br> - Give her one of those pillows, will you?<br> - No, not that.<br> Ohh.<br> Ain't nobody never been this<br> sweet to me before, Dave.<br> And you're sober too. Practically.<br> Sure.<br> - You know what Rosalie heard?<br> - No, what did she hear?<br> She heard you had a yen for<br> that schoolteacher, Miss French.<br> - Is that true, Dave?<br> - No.<br> - Dave, you can always...<br> - Let's sit down and get a drink.<br> The best in the house. Thank you.<br> Cigarettes.<br> - Two stingers.<br> - Oh!<br> Hello, Dawn.<br> Oh, I...<br> I'm sorry. This is Teddy, uh...?<br> Harperson.<br> - Won't you sit and join us? We...<br> - What are you doing here?<br> We've been doing the town.<br> Been just about everywhere.<br> I'm sorry, this is my uncle,<br> Dave Hirsh, the writer.<br> - Oh, how are you?<br> - You two know each other long?<br> - Well, no. Actually...<br> - We just met today.<br> Teddy is a traveling salesman.<br> And I am the farmer's daughter.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Harperson.<br> - Oh, you're leaving?<br> - No, you are.<br> Wait a minute.<br> - Look, I think you've got me wrong. We're...<br> - She's just a kid.<br> - I'm 18.<br> - I said goodbye, Mr. Harperson.<br> Don't you pay any attention<br> to him, he can't do this.<br> Dave, don't spoil<br> things, I'm having fun.<br> Oh, sure. You're having a jolly time.<br> - Look, uh...<br> - Walk.<br> Come here. Give me the coffee.<br> - It's for the other table.<br> - Get some more.<br> - Yeah, but I...<br> - Get some more.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Move over.<br> - Does your father know where you are?<br> - No.<br> I don't know where he is either.<br> - Doesn't that strike you funny?<br> - No, it breaks me up.<br> Hey, Ginnie.<br> - This is Dawn, my niece.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> My head aches.<br> - Maybe you can get her a cold towel, huh?<br> - I don't want a cold towel, I feel miserable.<br> Oh, well, honey. That's<br> because you're crocked.<br> Oh, a kid your age really<br> shouldn't drink so much.<br> Come on.<br> You get her straightened out and I'll<br> take her out to get a little air later.<br> One-way to Parkman.<br> Don't judge your father<br> too harshly, sweetie.<br> Sometimes when a man<br> aims high, he can miss.<br> - I don't wanna talk about it.<br> - Well, then let me talk about it.<br> I know you're trying<br> to hit back at your dad.<br> But who are you really hurting?<br> And what are you gonna<br> prove by becoming a tramp?<br> I'm not gonna become a tramp.<br> It doesn't take long, honey.<br> Couple more goons like that guy who picked<br> you up back there and a little booze, and...<br> Well, I ought to know,<br> I'm an expert on tramps.<br> I can't live at home.<br> Living at home isn't so bad, kid.<br> I'm gonna get a job in New York.<br> Oh. Well, look, do me a favor and<br> don't do anything until I get back.<br> You promise?<br> I promise, but you<br> won't change my mind.<br> Milton, Delford Junction,<br> North Oaks and Parkman.<br> I'm sorry if I upset you.<br> Upset me? Don't be ridiculous.<br> You make me feel like<br> one of the family.<br> It's a new feeling<br> to me and I like it.<br> - Be a good girl.<br> - Thank you.<br> Bye, kid.<br> Is she okay?<br> - She's fine.<br> - When do you figure on going home?<br> - What?<br> Any time you say, Dave.<br> - How about after Indianapolis?<br> - That's fine. That's great.<br> Hey, you know, you should<br> have seen him with his niece.<br> Oh, golly, he just<br> couldn't have been sweeter.<br> - Niece?<br> - Well, she is his niece.<br> - Bama's my uncle.<br> - She is too his niece.<br> Turn if off. I'd rather<br> listen to the singing.<br> - Baby, how about another<br> drink? I'd love one.<br> Dawn, is that you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you know what time it<br> is? Is she here? What happened?<br> Where have you been?<br> - Terre Haute.<br> - Who with? Where'd you go?<br> To some nightclubs<br> with no one you know.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night?<br> - Dawn, we wanna know what...<br> - I'm tired. I don't feel like talking.<br> Good night.<br> Dawn.<br> Dropped the cards like you're out.<br> - Playing?<br> - I'm in. I'm in, Dad.<br> Okay.<br> - I call.<br> - I'm out. How many<br> cards? Three cards.<br> - How many?<br> - I'm out.<br> How many?<br> - Two beauties. Two beauties.<br> You got them. How many?<br> - Same two beauties. Two beauties.<br> That's my call. I'm out.<br> - Give me the top. One on the top.<br> Hello.<br> Hello? Yes? Just a minute, please.<br> - It's Indianapolis.<br> - I'm still out.<br> Will you hold on for<br> just a minute, please?<br> Gwen, dear, I will not say you're out.<br> Dave has called twice.<br> And besides, you've<br> something to tell him now.<br> I'd rather you told him.<br> Now, Gwen, darling.<br> I know you've had a quarrel,<br> and it's made you unhappy.<br> Do you think you'll be happier<br> if you never see him again?<br> Hello? Yes, this is Miss French.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Dave. We have some<br> very exciting news for you.<br> The Atlantic took your story.<br> Five hundred dollars.<br> Is that right? Hey, that's<br> fine, isn't it? That's great.<br> But I got a couple more important<br> things I wanna talk to you about.<br> I suppose I haven't talked to<br> you because I had nothing to say.<br> Dave, I've been so<br> confused and troubled...<br> ...and now I'm not anymore.<br> Just talking to you...<br> ...I'd forgotten how warm<br> and deep your voice is.<br> Oh, yes, I've missed you.<br> I have missed you.<br> It's astonishing how much.<br> When?<br> I'll be here.<br> Good night, Dave. Thank you.<br> Good night, baby.<br> Aces up.<br> Three nines.<br> Oh, happy day. You did it again.<br> Yeah, a little lucky.<br> You guys must be a couple<br> of grand ahead, huh?<br> - Oh, more or less.<br> - You always play together?<br> Mostly.<br> Two of you are pretty lucky.<br> I think we need a new deck.<br> Tell me something. That phone call.<br> Something very interesting?<br> For me, yeah. Why?<br> No reason at all, except, uh...<br> ...made me think of a gambler<br> I used to know in Philly.<br> This guy had a pretty cute gimmick.<br> He used to sit in a card game...<br> ...a buddy of his would go out and<br> call him on the phone and guess what.<br> He'd tell him what every<br> guy in the game was holding.<br> Makes you think, doesn't it?<br> Yeah, I'd say he was a dishonest bum.<br> You know something? He was.<br> - Charlie, I better straighten you out about...<br> - You just take it easy.<br> This fella here's the heavy loser tonight,<br> and I reckon he's entitled to be a bit stupid.<br> - Now, who could have phoned?<br> - Deal.<br> Well, let's say the waiter.<br> - The waiter?<br> - Yeah, he was in here, wasn't he?<br> - He could have cased everybody's cards.<br> - Yeah.<br> Now, mind you, I<br> didn't say that he did.<br> Mm.<br> - You never take that hat off, do you?<br> - Nope, never take it off.<br> Why?<br> He got a little shortwave<br> radio he's got sewn in the hat.<br> And it gives us back signals to<br> what you bums are holding. Why?<br> Do you know something?<br> This creep could be<br> kidding on the square.<br> Let's just take a look, huh?<br> All right, back away from the dough.<br> All right.<br> Don't like nobody to touch my hat.<br> Now, pick it up.<br> Pick it up and put it on his head.<br> All right, beat it. Beat it.<br> Move, sweetie, get out of here.<br> - You all right?<br> - I don't know. Where's my hat?<br> - Never mind your hat.<br> Get up here. I'll get it.<br> - Oh, those dogs.<br> - Get that.<br> Go back to Parkman. I'm gonna<br> take him to the hospital.<br> - Ain't there nothing we can do?<br> - Do what I told you.<br> - I don't like nobody to touch my hat.<br> - Put your arm around me. Come on.<br> - Here's your coat. Good call.<br> Easy now.<br> Mr. Dillert.<br> I never heard of anyone<br> sleeping with a hat on.<br> Well, ma'am, you heard<br> it now. It brings me luck.<br> That's a pagan superstition.<br> Yeah.<br> It sure is, ma'am.<br> Come in.<br> Oh, how do you feel, old buddy?<br> How do I feel, old buddy, huh?<br> How would you feel, strangers<br> busting in here day and night...<br> ...turning you over,<br> feeling under the covers?<br> Boy, they sure get familiar<br> around here in a hurry.<br> - Is he being a tough patient, Sister?<br> - While she was trying to get my hat...<br> ...I was teaching her how to<br> deal a second-top-card first.<br> Not teaching me, Mr.<br> Dillert, showing me.<br> - Please don't stay long.<br> - I won't.<br> Wanna know something<br> funny? She was beating me.<br> The Lord's on my side, Mr. Dillert.<br> So you finally got here, Dave.<br> Sure took you a long time.<br> They only allow visitors<br> in the afternoon.<br> Well, you just better get yourself<br> hustling and get me out of this flea trap.<br> Why?<br> Why? I don't trust them sisters.<br> What do you mean, you<br> don't trust them sisters?<br> They stole my clothes.<br> Ain't got a stitch here.<br> Those are doctor's orders.<br> They take everybody's clothes.<br> - He's the only man that can get them back.<br> - Get me the doctor.<br> Why don't you just ring that bell?<br> It ain't no good no more.<br> I got mad and I busted it.<br> Dave, you got me in this<br> here bed, now get me out.<br> Okay, I'll go talk to the doc.<br> - Oh, hello, doctor.<br> - Hi.<br> I want my pants, doc.<br> I'm afraid we're going to have to<br> keep you here for a while, Mr. Dillert.<br> Now, what is this? A hospital or jail?<br> It's not a question of legality. It's a<br> question of professional responsibility.<br> You're a sick man, Mr. Dillert. Not<br> from the knife wound, that was slight.<br> But we discovered quite accidentally<br> that you have rather an advanced case...<br> ...of diabetes mellitus.<br> I got what?<br> Diabetes?<br> I noticed there was considerable<br> alcohol content in your blood test.<br> How much whiskey do you<br> drink in a day, Mr. Dillert?<br> - That's a pretty good question.<br> - Oh, I don't rightly know.<br> - Maybe a fifth, maybe less. I don't know.<br> - Maybe more.<br> Course, you'll have to<br> stop drinking, Mr. Dillert.<br> Alcohol adds an enormous<br> amount of sugar to the blood.<br> You need treatment, Mr.<br> Dillert. Immediate treatment.<br> You mean it's that serious?<br> The rate Mr. Dillert is going<br> now, it's more than serious.<br> All right, you've done your duty, doc.<br> Now, you just tell me what to<br> do to get out of this place...<br> ...without busting down that<br> door and I'll be obliged.<br> I'll, uh, send up a<br> release for you to sign.<br> Pardon me.<br> Can you tell me where I can<br> find Miss French, the teacher?<br> Second floor. I believe it's Room 213.<br> Thank you. Is, um,<br> she teaching class now?<br> The period will be<br> over in a few minutes.<br> Now, we have time for<br> a few more questions.<br> Wally?<br> Miss French, do you think<br> that Emile Zola was immoral?<br> No, I don't at all.<br> Even when writing about depraved people,<br> his attitude was essentially moral.<br> But he had a mistress, didn't he?<br> You'll have to take<br> that up with Mrs. Zola.<br> Why do you ask?<br> Well, a friend of mine believes that<br> literary men have, well, different standards.<br> But it seems to me that if it's all right for<br> them, it should be all right for anybody else.<br> Well, I don't agree<br> with your friend, Wally.<br> But it is true, I believe, that good<br> writers feel more deeply than the rest of us.<br> They have greater appetites for life.<br> If I'd known Poe, I would undoubtedly<br> have been repelled by his drinking...<br> ...but I would have<br> tried to understand him.<br> Just as I would have tried to understand<br> Dr. Johnson for his gluttony...<br> ...de Quincy for using drugs, and<br> Baudelaire for his neurotic promiscuity.<br> They were big men. Big in<br> weakness, bigger in strength.<br> - Are you Miss French?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm Ginnie Moorehead.<br> You don't know me, but I know<br> you. Least I know about you.<br> Uh, I'd kind of like to<br> talk to you about something.<br> Well, what can I do for you?<br> Gee, you don't look<br> like a schoolteacher.<br> Thank you. I assume<br> that was a compliment.<br> Oh, sure.<br> Uh...<br> - May I sit down?<br> - Of course.<br> You won't tell Dave I've been here, will<br> you? He'd skin me alive if he knowed I was.<br> Is he a friend of yours?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm not gonna take up much<br> of your time, Miss French.<br> But he's coming back today, and<br> there's something I just gotta know.<br> Are you gonna marry him?<br> - Am I what?<br> - I gotta know how things stand, that's all.<br> - Well, I'm not sure I can...<br> - Miss French, let me explain.<br> You see, I think<br> he's in love with you.<br> And if you're gonna marry<br> him, then I'll clear it out.<br> But if it's just one of them things...<br> Are you from Chicago?<br> Yeah. Yeah, did he tell you about me?<br> No, I read the papers.<br> Oh. Oh, golly, wasn't that terrible?<br> I knewed I shouldn't have come...<br> ...but, oh, I'm very crazy<br> about him, you see, Miss French.<br> And this is the God's truth. I<br> want him to have what he wants.<br> Even if it means you instead of me.<br> I assume Mr. Hirsh discussed me with<br> you, otherwise you wouldn't be here.<br> That's not so. Oh,<br> he never said nothing.<br> I kept asking, but he never said nothing.<br> Here and in Terre Haute and Indianapolis...<br> ...but he never said nothing.<br> - You were on that trip?<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, but he ain't in love<br> with me, Miss French.<br> I wish he was.<br> I'd give my right eye if he was.<br> I never felt like this about<br> nobody in my whole life.<br> He just touches me and I fall apart.<br> I do wish you wouldn't cry.<br> Whatever you may have<br> imagined, or whatever Dave...<br> ...himself may have told you...<br> ...there's absolutely nothing<br> between Mr. Hirsh and myself.<br> I've helped him with his<br> writing, nothing else.<br> Consequently, I'm not your rival.<br> Ohh.<br> Oh, Miss French, I'm<br> glad I come, then.<br> Oh, I was so scared.<br> You don't know how scared I was.<br> Because I knowed you could take<br> him away from me if you want to.<br> Because I ain't rich<br> or smart like you.<br> Haven't got nothing.<br> Not even a reputation.<br> I'm sure you have a<br> reputation, Miss Moorehead.<br> Well...<br> ...that's one thing<br> don't bother Dave none.<br> I don't like to be rude, but<br> my next class is coming in now.<br> Oh, I'll go. You ain't<br> sore at me for coming?<br> In a way, I'm grateful.<br> Grateful?<br> I don't know why, Miss French...<br> ...but thank you.<br> Thanks awfully much.<br> Now, you won't say nothing,<br> not to nobody, will you?<br> Nobody.<br> - Ohh. Goodbye, Miss French.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Man, this town sure is<br> jumping on all fours.<br> "Parkman Centennial, 1848-1948."<br> Man, it took them a hundred<br> years to build this burg?<br> That's a waste of time.<br> Why don't you knock that stuff off?<br> Come on, Dave. Man, I<br> don't want any arguments.<br> I've been living a certain way all my<br> life, and I ain't about to change it.<br> Don't be a damn fool. Remember<br> what the doctor told you?<br> Just watch your diet and keep taking<br> those shots and you'll live a long life.<br> Why don't you stop this, huh?<br> You're gonna keep on doing this,<br> and I'm gonna lose a friend.<br> And I ain't had so many friends<br> that I can afford to lose one.<br> - You give me no choice.<br> - It ain't your right to choose.<br> That looks like my niece.<br> Dawn.<br> Run along. I'll pick up my car.<br> - Can you make it with one arm?<br> - Yeah.<br> How's my favorite niece?<br> Just fine. I got a job in<br> New York with a publisher.<br> Well, I'll only be the office<br> girl, but isn't it wonderful?<br> I think it's great. What<br> do your parents think?<br> Well, about what I expected,<br> but they'll get over it.<br> Dave, could you give<br> me a minute, please?<br> I have some friends in<br> New York that I'll phone.<br> Look, Dave, I've taken about<br> all I'm going to take from you.<br> And it's not just that<br> knifing brawl and...<br> Did you bring me here for another<br> lecture? Because if you did...<br> - Lower your voice.<br> - I have no secrets.<br> Shh. Come on back<br> here. This is important.<br> Edith, if you don't mind.<br> I think you should stay, Miss Barclay.<br> This little gathering may interest you.<br> All right, Edith.<br> Okay, Dave, I'm not going into<br> this latest disgrace of yours.<br> Of course, it's in all the papers, but<br> never mind, we'll forget about that.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> I got a couple of things<br> I'd like to talk...<br> You advised Dawn to go<br> to New York, didn't you?<br> - I did not.<br> - Don't give me that.<br> Before you got here, she...<br> Well, you don't know what this means<br> to me, Dave. You're not a father.<br> That's true.<br> So if I hurt anyone, I hurt myself.<br> But a father, that's different.<br> If he's a hypocrite, he ought to be<br> a good one and not get caught at it.<br> What are you getting at?<br> That very strict rule<br> that you told me about.<br> Never getting involved<br> with your employees.<br> Well, what about it?<br> It's a damn good rule.<br> Particularly if you're bringing<br> up a fine, decent young girl.<br> - Are you suggesting...?<br> - I'm saying it, Frank.<br> This is a small town, and what I<br> know, Dawn could easily also know.<br> Let's face it, that's no good.<br> - Mr. Hirsh, I...<br> Don't listen to him.<br> He's no good now, he never<br> was, he never will be.<br> If you're through with<br> your lecture, I'll leave.<br> I'm sorry, Miss Barclay...<br> ...but I happen to be<br> very fond of my niece.<br> Frank, I'm... I'm gonna leave Parkman.<br> Oh, now, now. Don't get excited.<br> He was probably just guessing.<br> - I'm sure he was guessing.<br> - No.<br> Oh, Frank. Why didn't<br> I meet you first?<br> I've often thought about that.<br> I don't know whether<br> you realize this...<br> ...but when I married Agnes,<br> you were just 4 years old.<br> If you don't need me any longer...<br> ...I think I'll go home and pack.<br> Oh, Dave, come on in.<br> - Hello, professor.<br> We have a very pretty check of yours, and<br> a fine letter from a most discerning editor.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thanks.<br> But we owe it all to<br> Gwen. Where is she?<br> You have every reason to be<br> enormously proud, dear Dave.<br> Have you told her I've been phoning?<br> I'm afraid she won't<br> be with us this evening.<br> I'm very sorry. Here's your letter.<br> Oh, thunderation.<br> How I envy people who can tell<br> little lies with conviction.<br> She may feel differently<br> tomorrow or the day after.<br> I know she doesn't wanna see<br> me, but if I just knew why.<br> Dear Dave, first let me mix<br> you a martini that's pure magic.<br> It may not make one's<br> problems disappear...<br> ...but it does reduce their size.<br> But where is she?<br> She must be somewhere.<br> I'm afraid that's of very<br> little consequence, dear Dave.<br> She seems quite<br> determined not to see you.<br> Please don't ask me why. I<br> have no right to interfere.<br> She's upstairs, isn't she?<br> - I'll go see her.<br> - I couldn't stop you.<br> - You're younger than I am.<br> - Thanks.<br> Gwen. Gwen, I'm coming up.<br> Gwen?<br> Gwen?<br> Where are you? You're<br> gonna talk to me.<br> Gwen?<br> Doesn't this strike you<br> as just a little crude?<br> Yeah. Now, tell me what kind<br> of a game you're playing.<br> I'm not an authority on games<br> or the people who frequent them.<br> - Lf you're thinking about the gambling...<br> - This is my room. I did not invite you in.<br> Okay, okay, I'll apologize later.<br> Now, look, I just went away with<br> Bama because you kept ignoring me.<br> - Lf it means that much to you...<br> - It doesn't mean that much.<br> It doesn't at all.<br> - Lf you don't mind, I'd like to finish this.<br> - What the devil's happened to you?<br> When you were on the<br> phone with me, you were...<br> - What made you change?<br> - Don't look for tragic implications.<br> - I've simply come to my senses.<br> - You mean you've lost your senses.<br> Good night, Dave.<br> Gwen, I'm in love with you.<br> You said you were with me.<br> Don't handle me, Dave. Your hands on<br> me are not in the least persuasive.<br> Look, just do me one thing.<br> Just tell me what's eating you.<br> If we discuss it, you could be wrong.<br> I said good night.<br> Gwen.<br> Why don't we cut this<br> out? This is a very...<br> If you put your hands on me again, I swear<br> I'll call the police and have you thrown out.<br> I don't like your life. I<br> don't like your thinking.<br> I don't like the people you like.<br> Now, leave me alone. Stay away from me.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Waiting for you.<br> Why?<br> Well, you know that magazine<br> with your story in it?<br> It's on sale down at the drugstore.<br> - I'll run down and buy one. - You<br> can't. I bought them all up. Ha-ha.<br> I got one more left.<br> You know, everybody's been<br> congratulating me today.<br> Really, what for?<br> Because I'm a certain friend of yours.<br> Oh, golly, all the girls at the<br> factory have been shaking hands with me.<br> Been signing autographs all day.<br> - You've been what?<br> - Signing autographs, yeah.<br> I write, uh...<br> I write, "I hope you like<br> it. " And I sign my name.<br> - Pretty good publicity, don't you think?<br> - Get it through your head...<br> ...that nobody signs their name to<br> a story that somebody else wrote.<br> But, Dave, you sign your name to a<br> book you send somebody for Christmas.<br> Look, stupid, you had nothing to<br> do with the writing of this story.<br> I'm your girlfriend.<br> That's something else I wanna discuss<br> with you. You're not my girlfriend.<br> I bought you drinks, we had<br> laughs, I showed you around...<br> ...but you're not my girlfriend.<br> - Everybody thinks I am.<br> - I don't care what they think.<br> You haven't got the brains or the<br> willpower to sit down and read this story.<br> You can't talk to me like this.<br> I can't, huh? You haven't got enough<br> sense to come in out of the rain...<br> ...unless somebody<br> leads you by the hand.<br> That's only because you'd<br> go anywhere with anybody.<br> Dave.<br> Oh, Dave, you really should<br> not have talked to me like that.<br> Aw, forget it.<br> - Hey, this is sure one hell of a story, Dave.<br> - Thanks.<br> Something bugging you?<br> Yeah, it's this place, it<br> looks like a rat's nest.<br> Why don't we get somebody to clean it?<br> You suppose we could get that Ginnie<br> Moorehead to keep the place clean?<br> You kidding? She can't<br> keep herself clean.<br> Oh, by the way, when's the wedding?<br> - What wedding?<br> - What wedding?<br> Dave, just between you and me, that<br> little old schoolteacher of yours...<br> ...you know, she ain't<br> too good an influence.<br> You know ever since you give up<br> drinking, you've been impossible, boy?<br> Dames.<br> What do you think<br> you're doing out there?<br> Sitting.<br> That's ridiculous. Come on in.<br> Come on inside.<br> All right.<br> But you got no right to talk<br> to me the way you did, Dave.<br> I'm a human being and I got as many<br> rights and feelings as anybody else.<br> Okay, so you're a human being.<br> Just because that<br> teacher don't want you...<br> ...don't give you no<br> right to take it out on me.<br> Will you please forget it, Ginnie?<br> You're still in love<br> with her, ain't you?<br> No, I'm not.<br> Yes, you are. I can tell.<br> Look, I'm not in love with anybody.<br> Dave.<br> Dave, be in love with me.<br> Oh, I love you so much.<br> I never met anybody like<br> you before in my whole life.<br> Oh, I love you so awful, awful much.<br> Don't cry, Ginnie, don't cry.<br> I'm sorry if I hurt you. Forgive me,<br> I didn't meant it. I'm terribly sorry.<br> You know I'd do<br> anything for you, Dave.<br> I'd do anything, ask me.<br> Would you, uh...?<br> Would you clean up the place for me?<br> - Oh, could I?<br> - Sure.<br> Oh, sure. Oh, I'd love to.<br> Oh, why, sure. Oh, I'd love to.<br> I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll come every day before work.<br> You just call me.<br> But you gotta remember, I'm human.<br> I'll bear that in mind.<br> "And before he was aware of it...<br> ...he was lost.<br> There wasn't much time left...<br> ...and he realized that he would<br> have to return over familiar ground...<br> ...running to reach the point at<br> which he could start all over again. "<br> Is that the end?<br> - Did you like it?<br> - Oh, golly. I liked it fine, Dave.<br> I really liked it a lot.<br> - That means not very much.<br> - No, honest, I really liked it a lot.<br> Golly, just think you can put those<br> words down on paper like that...<br> ...and all I can do is hem brassieres.<br> You know, it really makes me<br> feel like a terrible failure.<br> - What did you like about it, Ginnie?<br> - Everything.<br> Like what?<br> Well, I... The people.<br> - What people?<br> - All of them.<br> Okay, so you like all of the people,<br> but what did the story mean to you?<br> Well, it means a lot.<br> - Well, then tell me what it's all about.<br> - Well, Dave, don't get mad.<br> Every time I open my<br> mouth, you get mad at me.<br> You don't understand a word of what I<br> said. You don't understand the story.<br> No, I don't, but that<br> don't mean I don't like it.<br> I don't understand you neither, but<br> that don't mean I don't like you.<br> I love you.<br> But I don't understand you.<br> So, what's the matter with that?<br> Ginnie.<br> - What?<br> - Will you marry me?<br> What?<br> Marry me, now, tonight.<br> Oh, Dave.<br> You really shouldn't kid<br> around about a thing like that.<br> Oh, please, Dave, not with me.<br> You don't know how it hurts me.<br> I'm not kidding, Ginnie.<br> Oh, Dave.<br> Oh, I hope you're not.<br> Oh.<br> I think I'll want that more than I<br> want anything in the whole wide world.<br> - I don't know what to say.<br> - Just say you will.<br> Oh, Dave.<br> Yes.<br> Bama.<br> - Well, who loused up my house?<br> Bama, guess what. You'll never<br> guess it in a hundred million years.<br> What, what?<br> - Dave and me, we're gonna get married.<br> Oh, that's nice. No,<br> we really are, Bama.<br> You off your rocker?<br> Bama, you got no right to say that.<br> Look, all due respect to Ginnie, but<br> you ain't really gonna marry this broad?<br> I am. Tonight.<br> - I don't know if you're crazy or...<br> - Bama, please, he wants to marry me.<br> - You got no right...<br> - I'm trying to talk to Dave.<br> - We don't need your advice.<br> - Be a good girl and shut up.<br> You might as well get used<br> to it, she's gonna be my wife.<br> Man, this just don't make sense.<br> I got nothing against<br> Ginnie. Nothing at all.<br> - But even she knows she's a pig.<br> - All right, that's enough of that.<br> Come on, go home and<br> put something nice on...<br> ...and I'll call the judge and<br> then come by and pick you up.<br> Bama. Bama, please<br> don't spoil it for me.<br> - Please, Bama, it'd just kill me.<br> - He won't spoil it, honey.<br> I never been so happy<br> in my whole life.<br> Oh, boy.<br> I could use a best man.<br> Well, it sure ain't gonna be me.<br> I don't know what went on between<br> you and that schoolteacher...<br> ...but you just went<br> and blew your top.<br> You ain't really gonna get<br> hitched up with that dumb pushover?<br> Now, nobody would do that.<br> Don't you like the way<br> she cleaned up your place?<br> You ain't gonna marry her for that.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I'm just tired of being<br> lonely, that's all.<br> And the way she feels<br> about me, well...<br> ...nobody ever felt<br> that way about me before.<br> And besides, maybe I can help her.<br> I sure can't help myself.<br> But the fact remains,<br> she's still a pig.<br> I told you I'm gonna marry<br> her, so knock off the language.<br> Really made up your mind, didn't you?<br> Yeah, I'm gonna phone the judge<br> and have him set it up tonight.<br> All right. In that case, I<br> just lost myself a friend.<br> I got no use for anybody that stupid.<br> Then I pronounce you man<br> and wife. Congratulations.<br> - Is that all?<br> - That's all.<br> - We're married? Tight as a drum.<br> This'll prove it to any room clerk.<br> The Hirshes.<br> - Good evening. Good evening.<br> I thought Dawn was taking a later bus?<br> It, uh, seems to be the last one.<br> It'll be nice to have company.<br> Yes, won't it?<br> Dave.<br> Bama should have been here.<br> Well, he was busy, I guess.<br> I don't know why he<br> don't like me, Dave.<br> I guess there's no sense<br> in beating a dead horse.<br> Dave?<br> I'm gonna make you a good wife, Dave.<br> A really good wife.<br> You're not gonna be sorry.<br> I believe you.<br> Dave?<br> Can we go to Terre<br> Haute on our honeymoon?<br> We can get a motel. It wouldn't<br> cost too much, and we can cook in.<br> I don't care where we go, baby.<br> I just wanna get out of Parkman.<br> And can we go by my place first?<br> I'd kind of like to...<br> ...pick up my pillow<br> and take it with us.<br> Remember the one you bought me?<br> I remember.<br> And can we go by Smitty's<br> for just one beer?<br> I'd like to see the girls.<br> They're expecting it.<br> They bought some rice.<br> Bama, what are you doing here?<br> I thought you was the best man.<br> They're coming back to say<br> goodbye. You want some rice?<br> - He didn't come in here, did he?<br> - Who?<br> What's-his-name. Ginnie's old<br> friend. That hood from Chicago.<br> He heard she got married.<br> He's looking for Dave.<br> - Oh, he's full of talk.<br> - He's got a gun and he's crazy drunk.<br> What's he aiming to do?<br> Kill Dave, he says. He's<br> crazy. I tried talking to him...<br> ...and he pulled a gun on me.<br> - You stay here and I'll try and find Dave.<br> Okay.<br> ...and advertises sponsors' products.<br> Have it free.
