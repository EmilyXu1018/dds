He's 15-1 and it's<br> his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.<br> What do you want from me?<br> My head on a plate?<br> No, your bass.<br> If we hock that and my sax...<br> Are you crazy?

I'm the bass fiddle.<br> Just call me Daphne.<br> My name is Josephine. Sax.<br> - Welcome to No Man's Land.<br> - You'll be sorry.<br> - Take off your corsets and spread out.<br> - Oh, I don't wear one myself.<br> - Don't you bulge?<br> - Bulge? Me?<br> I have the most divine seamstress.<br> Comes in just once a month.<br> - She is so inexpensive and she told...<br> - Come on, Daphne.<br> Say, do you know the one<br> about the girl tuba player<br> who was stranded on an island<br> with a one-legged jockey?<br> - No. How does it go?<br> - Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.<br> They went to a conservatory.<br> How about that talent, huh?<br> - Like fallin' into a tub of butter.<br> - Watch it, Daphne.<br> When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I was<br> locked up overnight in a pastry shop.<br> And there was goodies all around.<br> Jelly rolls, mocha clairs<br> and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...<br> Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.<br> We're on a diet.<br> Yeah, sure, Joe.<br> Not there. That's the emergency brake.<br> Now you've done it.<br> - Done what?<br> - You tore off one of my chests.<br> - You'd better go get it fixed.<br> - You'd better come help me.<br> This way, Daphne.<br> Now you tore the other one.<br> Terribly sorry.<br> It's OK. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.<br> - You won't tell anybody, will you?<br> - Tell what?<br> If they catch me once more,<br> they'll kick me out of the band.<br> Are you the replacement<br> for the bass and sax?<br> That's us. And I'm Daphne.<br> This is Joe... sephine.<br> Come in.<br> I'm Sugar Cane.<br> - Sugar Cane?<br> - I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.<br> - Polish?<br> - Yes. I come from this musical family.<br> My mother's a piano teacher.<br> My father was a conductor.<br> - Where did he conduct?<br> - On the Baltimore and Ohio.<br> I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.<br> I don't have much of a voice,<br> but this isn't much of a band, either.<br> I'm only with them cos I'm running away.<br> - Running away from what?<br> - Oh, don't get me started on that.<br> Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.<br> I'll take a rain check.<br> I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.<br> I can stop if I want to, only I don't want to.<br> - Especially when I'm blue.<br> - We understand.<br> All the girls drink. But I'm the one<br> that gets caught. Story of my life.<br> I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.<br> Are my seams straight?<br> I'll say.<br> - See you around, girls.<br> - Bye, Sugar.<br> We have been playing<br> with the wrong bands.<br> - Down, Daphne.<br> - See the shape of that liquor cabinet?<br> Forget it. One false move<br> and we're off the train.<br> Then it's the police,<br> the papers and the Mob in Chicago.<br> Boy, would I love to<br> borrow a cup of that Sugar.<br> Look...<br> No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.<br> You tore 'em again.<br> Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?<br> Playing square dances?<br> No. Funerals.<br> Would you mind rejoining the living?<br> Goose it up a little.<br> We'll try.<br> How did those holes get there?<br> Those?<br> I don't know.<br> Mice?<br> All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.<br> And put a little heat under it.<br> Bienstock!<br> Yes, Sue?<br> I thought I made it clear<br> that I don't want any drinking in this outfit.<br> All right, girls. Who does this belong to?<br> Come on, now. Speak up.<br> - Sugar, I warned you...<br> - Please, Mr Bienstock.<br> I've had it. In Kansas you smuggled<br> liquor in a shampoo bottle.<br> Before that you had<br> a pint in your ukelele...<br> Mr Bienstock, could I have my flask?<br> Sure. Pack your things.<br> At the next station... Your flask?<br> Yes. Just a little bourbon.<br> Must have slipped through.<br> Give me that.<br> Didn't you girls say<br> you went to a conservatory?<br> - Oh, yes. For a whole year.<br> - I thought you said three years.<br> We got time off for good behaviour.<br> There are two things I will not put up with<br> during working hours: liquor and men.<br> - Men?<br> - Don't worry about that.<br> We wouldn't be caught dead with men.<br> Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.<br> And they all just want<br> one thing from a girl.<br> I beg your pardon, miss.<br> All right, girls. From the top again.<br> - Hortense, dear, good night.<br> - Good night, Daphne.<br> - Maude, sweet dreams.<br> - Good night, Daphne.<br> Good night, Gloria.<br> Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?<br> - Nighty-night, Emily.<br> - Toodle-oo.<br> How about that "toodle-oo".<br> Steady, boy.<br> Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.<br> - I'm a girl.<br> - You're a girl.<br> I'm a girl. I'm a girl.<br> I'm a...<br> Get a load of that rhythm section.<br> I'm a girl.<br> I'm a girl. I'm a girl.<br> I'm a girl.<br> Good night, Sugar.<br> Good night, honey.<br> Honey? Hey, she called me "honey".<br> Ooh, honey.<br> - What are you doin'?<br> - Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.<br> There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.<br> Supposin' I gotta go...<br> Iike for a drink of water or something.<br> - Fight it.<br> - Well, suppose I lose.<br> - Suppose it's an emergency.<br> - Pull the emergency brake.<br> Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's<br> something funny about those new girls.<br> - Funny? ln what way?<br> - I don't know, but I can feel it right here.<br> Having an ulcer is like<br> having a burglar alarm go off inside you.<br> You watch your ulcers,<br> I'll watch those two.<br> OK, everybody go to bed.<br> Good night, girls.<br> - Good night, Daphne.<br> - Good night, Josephine.<br> I'm a girl. I'm a girl.<br> I wish I were dead.<br> I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...<br> Daphne.<br> Sugar.<br> I wanted to thank you for<br> covering up for me. You're a real pal.<br> It's nothing.<br> I just thought that<br> us girls should stick together.<br> If it wasn't for you,<br> they'd have kicked me off the train.<br> I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,<br> sitting on my ukulele.<br> It's freezing outside.<br> I mean, when I think about you<br> and your poor ukulele...<br> If there's ever anything I can do for you...<br> I can think of a million things.<br> That's one of 'em.<br> It's Sweet Sue.<br> I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.<br> Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.<br> Not even Josephine.<br> Maybe I'd better stay here<br> till she goes back to sleep.<br> You stay here as long as you like.<br> I'm not crowding you, am l?<br> No. It's nice and cosy.<br> When I was a little girl, on cold nights<br> like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.<br> We'd cuddle up under the covers and<br> pretend we were lost in a dark cave<br> and were trying to find our way out.<br> Very interesting.<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - No, no. Not a thing.<br> You poor thing. You're trembling all over.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> - Your head's hot.<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> - You've got cold feet.<br> - Isn't that ridiculous?<br> Here, let me warm them up a little.<br> - There. Isn't that better?<br> - Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...<br> - What?<br> - I'm a very sick girl.<br> - I'd better go before I catch something.<br> - Not that sick.<br> I've got very low resistance.<br> Sugar, if you feel you're<br> coming down with something, my dear,<br> the best thing in the world<br> is a shot of whiskey.<br> - You've got some?<br> - I know where to get it.<br> Don't move.<br> - Hold on.<br> - OK.<br> Up. Up.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - How's the bottle?<br> - Half-full.<br> - You'd better get some cups.<br> - Cups?<br> Oh, I tell you, my dear,<br> this is the only way to travel.<br> Put on the lights.<br> I can't see what I'm doing.<br> No lights. We don't want them to know.<br> - But I might spill some.<br> - So spill it.<br> Spills, thrills, laughs and games.<br> This may even turn out<br> to be a surprise party.<br> - What's the surprise?<br> - Not yet.<br> - When?<br> - Better have a drink first.<br> That'll put hair on your chest.<br> No fair guessing.<br> Is this a private clambake?<br> It's private. Please, go away.<br> Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?<br> - Sure.<br> - Who needs vermouth?<br> We've got bourbon.<br> We can make Manhattans.<br> Manhattans? At this time of night?<br> - Bring the cocktail shaker.<br> - Oh, Sugar.<br> You're gonna spoil my surprise.<br> - Hey, honey, what's up?<br> - Party in upper 7.<br> - I'll get cheese and crackers.<br> - I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.<br> Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.<br> - You got a corkscrew?<br> - Stella has.<br> Go get some paper cups.<br> Hey, there's a party in upper 7.<br> - Here's the vermouth.<br> - This is a private party. Please go away.<br> I brought some cheese and crackers.<br> - Will ten cups be enough?<br> - This is a party for two. Ten cups?<br> - Please, girls. Will you stop this?<br> - Could you use some Southern Comfort?<br> Girls, you'll wake up<br> the neighbours downstairs.<br> Watch that corkscrew.<br> - Here's a cracker.<br> - No crackers in bed.<br> Will you girls go away<br> and form your own party?<br> Here's the cocktail shaker.<br> - I wish we had ice.<br> - Easy on the vermouth.<br> - Pass me the peanut butter.<br> - Anyone for salami?<br> No more food.<br> I'll have ants in the morning.<br> Hey. Have you got any<br> maraschino cherries on you?<br> Never mind.<br> Maraschino cherries?<br> What's going on here?<br> Daphne. Daphne, where are you?<br> It's not my fault. I didn't invite 'em.<br> Come on, girls, break it up.<br> You heard Josephine.<br> Girls. Everybody out.<br> - Not you, Sugar.<br> - I'm going to get some ice.<br> Get out.<br> That's right, Sugar.<br> Now the rest of you. Out.<br> - Come on in. The water's fine.<br> - Have a Manhattan.<br> - Pipe down. We'll all be fired.<br> - Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.<br> Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.<br> You've had your fun.<br> The party's over. Everybody go home.<br> - What's this?<br> - Josephine, over here before it melts.<br> Put it here.<br> Sugar, you're gonna<br> get into a lot of trouble.<br> You'd better keep a lookout.<br> If Bienstock catches you again...<br> What's the matter with you, anyway?<br> I'm not very bright, I guess.<br> I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.<br> No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I<br> wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.<br> Well, why'd you take this job?<br> I used to sing with male bands,<br> but I can't afford it any more.<br> Have you ever been with a male band?<br> Who, me?<br> That's what I'm running away from.<br> I worked with six in the last two years.<br> Oh, brother.<br> - Rough?<br> - I'll say.<br> - You can't trust those guys.<br> - I can't trust myself.<br> I have this thing about saxophone players.<br> Especially tenor sax.<br> - Really?<br> - I don't know why, but they curdle me.<br> All they have to do is play eight bars of<br> "Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby"<br> and I get goose-pimply all over,<br> and I come to 'em.<br> - That so?<br> - Every time.<br> You know, I play tenor sax.<br> But you're a girl - thank goodness.<br> That's why I joined this band.<br> Safety first. Anything<br> to get away from those bums.<br> You don't know what they're like.<br> You fall for 'em.<br> You think this is gonna be<br> the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.<br> The next thing you know,<br> they're borrowing money from you,<br> spending it on other dames<br> and betting on horses.<br> You don't say.<br> Then one morning you wake up,<br> the guy's gone, the sax's gone.<br> All that's left is a pair of old socks<br> and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.<br> You pull yourself together, you go on to<br> the next job, the next saxophone player.<br> It's the same thing all over again.<br> You see what I mean? Not very bright.<br> Brains aren't everything.<br> I can tell you one thing. It's not<br> gonna happen to me again - ever.<br> I'm tired of getting<br> the fuzzy end of the lollipop.<br> Ice. What's keeping the ice?<br> The natives are getting restless.<br> - How about a couple of drinks for us?<br> - Sure.<br> - You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.<br> - You are?<br> That's a quarter of a century.<br> Makes a girl think.<br> - About what?<br> - The future.<br> You know - Iike a husband. That's why<br> I'm glad we're going to Florida.<br> - What's in Florida?<br> - Millionaires. Flocks of them.<br> They all go south for the winter, like birds.<br> - Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?<br> - I don't care how rich he is.<br> As long as he has a yacht, a private<br> railroad car and his own toothpaste.<br> - You're entitled.<br> - Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.<br> With money like Rockefeller and<br> shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.<br> - I want mine to wear glasses.<br> - Glasses?<br> Men who wear glasses are so much<br> more gentle and sweet and helpless.<br> - Haven't you ever noticed it?<br> - Yeah, now that you mention.<br> They get those weak eyes from reading.<br> Those long, tiny little columns<br> in The Wall Street Journal.<br> That bass fiddle, she sure<br> knows how to throw a party.<br> Hot-diggety-dog.<br> Well, happy days.<br> I hope this time you wind up<br> with the sweet end of the lollipop.<br> So the one-legged jockey said...<br> What did he say?<br> So the one-legged jockey said: "Don't<br> worry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle."<br> I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.<br> Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.<br> I think... Ow. You dropped it.<br> Oh, that's cold.<br> - Oh, no, please. Don't do that.<br> - She's ticklish.<br> Help. Please. Help. Help.<br> Josephine.<br> Please stop that. Stop that.<br> - What happened?<br> - Search me.<br> I mean, I'll see.<br> All right, what's goin' on around here?<br> Bienstock!<br> Are we in Florida?<br> Sugar?<br> Here. I'll carry the instruments.<br> - Thank you, Daphne.<br> - Thank you, Daphne.<br> Isn't she a sweetheart?<br> How do you do?<br> Zowie!<br> There they are. More millionaires<br> than you can shake a stick at.<br> I bet there isn't one under 75.<br> That's three quarters of a century.<br> Makes a girl think.<br> Let's hope they brought<br> their grandsons along.<br> Yes.<br> Pardon me, miss.<br> - May l?<br> - Help yourself.<br> I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.<br> I'm Cinderella the Second.<br> If there's one thing I admire,<br> it's a girl with a shapely ankle.<br> Me, too. Bye-bye.<br> - Let me carry one of the instruments.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Aren't you a sweetheart.<br> It certainly is delightful<br> having young blood around here.<br> Personally, I'm type O.<br> I've always been fascinated<br> by show business.<br> Is that so?<br> As a matter of fact,<br> it's cost my family quite a bit of money.<br> - Oh, you invest in shows?<br> - Showgirls.<br> - I've been married seven or eight times.<br> - You're not sure?<br> Mama is keeping score.<br> - She's getting annoyed with me.<br> - I wouldn't wonder.<br> So when George White's Scandals<br> opened, she packed me off to Florida.<br> She thinks I'm out on my yacht,<br> deep-sea fishing.<br> Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.<br> You're barking up the wrong fish.<br> If I promise not to be a naughty boy,<br> how about dinner?<br> - I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.<br> - Oh, of course.<br> - Which instrument do you play?<br> - Bull fiddle.<br> Oh, fascinating.<br> Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?<br> Most of the time, I slap it.<br> You must be quite a girl.<br> Wanna bet?<br> My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.<br> Sort of a contortionist.<br> She could smoke a cigarette<br> while holding it between her toes.<br> Zowie!<br> - But Mama broke it up.<br> - Why?<br> She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.<br> - Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.<br> - Bye-bye?<br> - This is where I get off.<br> - Oh, no. No, no, no.<br> You don't get off that easy.<br> All right, driver.<br> Once around the park, slowly.<br> And keep your eyes on the road.<br> What kind of a girl<br> do you think I am, Mr Fielding?<br> - Oh, please. It won't happen again.<br> - I'll say.<br> - Please, come back.<br> - I'll walk, thank you.<br> Please, miss...<br> Zowie!<br> All right, girls. Here are<br> your room assignments.<br> My glasses. Where are my glasses?<br> Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.<br> And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono<br> when you ring for room service.<br> Josephine and Daphne are in 413.<br> - Dolores and Sugar in 414.<br> - Me and Sugar?<br> What did you expect?<br> A one-legged jockey?<br> Rosella and Emily in 415...<br> - I wish they'd put us in the same room.<br> - So do l.<br> But don't worry about it, Sugar.<br> We'll see a lot of each other.<br> I had in Cincinnati,<br> my last time around with a male band.<br> What a heel he was.<br> - A saxophone player?<br> - What else? Was I ever crazy about him.<br> At two in the morning he sent me down<br> for hot dogs and potato salad.<br> They were out of potato salad,<br> so I brought coleslaw.<br> - So he threw it right in my face.<br> - Forget saxophone players.<br> You're gonna meet<br> a millionaire - a young one.<br> - What makes you so sure?<br> - My feminine intuition.<br> Oh. Are these your bags?<br> - And that one, too.<br> - OK, doll.<br> - I suppose you want a tip.<br> - Forget it, doll.<br> After all, you work here and I work here.<br> It's nice to have you with the organisation.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Listen, doll.<br> - What time do you get off tonight?<br> - Why?<br> I'm workin' the night shift and<br> I got a bottle of gin stashed away.<br> - When there's a lull...<br> - Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?<br> Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?<br> - Get lost, will you?<br> - That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.<br> Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.<br> - Dirty old man.<br> - What happened?<br> - I got pinched in the elevator.<br> - See how the other half lives?<br> I'm not even pretty.<br> They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.<br> It's like waving a red flag to a bull.<br> I'm sick of being the flag.<br> I wanna be a bull again.<br> - Let's blow.<br> - Blow where?<br> You promised me that the minute<br> we hit Florida we'd beat it.<br> - How can we? We're broke.<br> - We can find another band. A male band.<br> Spats Colombo is looking for us<br> in every male band in the country.<br> - It's humiliating.<br> - So you got pinched. So what?<br> Would you rather be<br> picking lead out of your navel?<br> But how long can we keep this up?<br> What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.<br> Look. We get room and board.<br> We're getting paid every week. Look.<br> Look at the palm trees, flying fish...<br> What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?<br> I know why you wanna stay.<br> You're after Sugar.<br> - Me, after Sugar?<br> - I saw the both of you in that bus.<br> All lovey-dovey and whisperin'<br> and borrowin' each other's lipstick.<br> - What are you saying? Me and Sugar?<br> - You and Sugar.<br> - We're just like sisters.<br> - Well, I'm your fairy godmother.<br> And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.<br> Are you decent?<br> Come in.<br> You girls seen a brown bag<br> with a white stripe and my initials?<br> It has all my resort clothes.<br> - No, we haven't.<br> - I can't understand it.<br> First my glasses disappear,<br> then one of my suitcases.<br> - Where's my ukulele?<br> - Now a ukulele.<br> - There must be a sneak thief around here.<br> - Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.<br> - We're going for a swim. Coming?<br> - A swim. Oh, you betcha.<br> You haven't got a bathing suit.<br> I don't have one either.<br> - She doesn't have one either. You don't?<br> - We can rent some at the bathhouse.<br> - How about you, Josephine?<br> - I think I'll soak in a hot tub.<br> - On a day like this? It's lovely out.<br> - Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.<br> - Don't get burned, Daphne.<br> - Oh, I've got suntan lotion.<br> See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,<br> we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.<br> Daphne. Cut it out.<br> What do you think you're doing?<br> Just a little trick<br> I picked up in the elevator.<br> Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.<br> Daphne. I had no idea<br> you were such a big girl.<br> You should've seen me<br> before I went on a diet.<br> I mean your shoulders and your arms.<br> It's carrying that bull fiddle around.<br> - There's one thing I envy you for.<br> - What's that?<br> You're so flat-chested.<br> Clothes hang better on you<br> than they do on me.<br> Watch out, Daphne.<br> Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.<br> Junior, time for your nap.<br> No. I wanna play.<br> You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!<br> This beach ain't big enough<br> for the both of us.<br> Mommy!<br> Here we go.<br> I like coffee, I like tea.<br> How many boys are stuck on me?<br> One, two, three,<br> four, five, six, seven...<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> You're not hurt, are you?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - I wish you'd make sure.<br> Because when people find out who I am,<br> they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me<br> for three quarters of a million dollars.<br> - I won't sue you, no matter who you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Now, really!<br> Sugar!<br> Come on.<br> Honestly.<br> Cheerio.<br> - Haven't I seen you somewhere before?<br> - Not very likely.<br> - Are you staying at the hotel?<br> - Not at all.<br> Your face is familiar.<br> You may have seen it<br> in newspapers or magazines.<br> - Vanity Fair.<br> - That must be it.<br> Would you mind moving a little?<br> You're blocking my view.<br> Of what?<br> They run up a red-and-white flag<br> on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.<br> You own a yacht?<br> Which one is it? The big one?<br> Certainly not.<br> With all the world unrest, nobody should<br> have a yacht that sleeps more than 12.<br> I quite agree.<br> Tell me, who runs up that flag?<br> - Your wife?<br> - No, my flag steward.<br> Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?<br> No, my cocktail steward.<br> Look, if you're interested in<br> whether I am married or not...<br> - Oh, I'm not interested at all.<br> - Well, I'm not.<br> That's very interesting.<br> - How's the stock market?<br> - Up, up, up.<br> I'll bet while we were talking,<br> you made $100,000?<br> Could be. You play the market?<br> - No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.<br> - For your own amusement?<br> We are appearing at the hotel.<br> Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.<br> - You're society girls.<br> - Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...<br> We're just doing this for a lark.<br> Syncopators. Does that mean you play<br> that very fast music... jazz?<br> Yeah. Real hot.<br> I guess some like it hot.<br> I personally prefer classical music.<br> I do, too.<br> As a matter of fact, I spent three years<br> at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.<br> Good school. Your family<br> doesn't object to your career?<br> They do indeed. Daddy threatened<br> to cut me off without a cent.<br> But I don't care. It was such a bore.<br> - Coming-out parties.<br> - Inauguration balls.<br> - Opening at the opera.<br> - Riding to hounds.<br> And always the same 400.<br> It's amazing we never<br> ran into each other before.<br> I'd have remembered<br> anybody as attractive as you.<br> You're very kind. I'll bet<br> you're also gentle and helpless.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> You see, I have a theory<br> about men who wear glasses.<br> - What theory?<br> - I'll tell you when I know you better.<br> - What are you doing tonight?<br> - Tonight?<br> Maybe you could come<br> to the hotel and hear us play.<br> - I'd like to, but that would be difficult.<br> - Why?<br> I only come ashore twice a day<br> when the tide goes out.<br> It's on account of these shells.<br> That's my hobby.<br> - You collect shells?<br> - So did my father and grandfather.<br> You might say we had<br> a passion for shells.<br> That's why we named<br> the oil company after it.<br> - Shell Oil?<br> - Please, no names. Just call me Junior.<br> Sugar!<br> Time to change for dinner.<br> Run along, Daphne dear.<br> I'll catch up with you later.<br> What, young lady?<br> What are you staring at?<br> Happens to me all the time.<br> I recognised him, too.<br> His picture was in Vanity Fair.<br> - Would you move along, please?<br> - Yes. You're in his way.<br> He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.<br> His yacht?<br> It sleeps 12. This is my friend Daphne.<br> She's a Vassar girl.<br> I'm a what?<br> Or was it Bryn Mawr?<br> I heard a very sad story<br> about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.<br> She squealed on her roommate<br> and they found her strangled<br> with her own brassiere.<br> Yes. We have to be very careful<br> whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?<br> Well, I think I'd better be going.<br> It was delightful meeting you both.<br> - You will come and hear us play?<br> - If it's at all possible.<br> Do come. It'll be such fun.<br> - And bring your yacht.<br> - Come on, Daphne.<br> - How about that guy?!<br> - Hands off. I saw him first.<br> Sugar, a little advice. If I were a girl,<br> and I am, I'd watch my step.<br> If I'd been watching my step,<br> I never would have met him.<br> - I can't wait to tell Josephine.<br> - Yeah, Josephine...<br> I can't wait to see her face.<br> Will she be surprised.<br> Neither can l.<br> Let's go tell her right now.<br> - We don't have to run.<br> - Oh yes, we do.<br> Josephine. Yoo-hoo.<br> - I guess she's not here.<br> - Isn't that funny. Josie!<br> I can't imagine where she'd be.<br> - I'll be back later.<br> - Oh, no. You wait.<br> I have a feeling<br> she'll show up any minute.<br> - Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.<br> - Yes. This is one for Ripley.<br> - Do you suppose she went shopping?<br> - Shopping. That's it.<br> Something tells me she's gonna come<br> through that door in a brand-new outfit.<br> - Josephine.<br> - Oh. I didn't hear you come in.<br> - Have a good time, girls?<br> - The most wonderful thing happened.<br> - What?<br> - Guess.<br> - They repealed Prohibition?<br> - Oh, you can do better than that.<br> - I met one of them.<br> - One of whom?<br> Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,<br> glasses and a yacht.<br> You don't say.<br> He's not only got a yacht.<br> He's got a bicycle.<br> Daphne.<br> Go on. Tell me all about him.<br> Well, he's young and he's handsome.<br> He's a bachelor.<br> He's a real gentleman.<br> You know. Not one of these grabbers.<br> Maybe you'd better go after him<br> if you don't want to lose him.<br> I'm not gonna let this one get away.<br> He's so cute. He collects shells.<br> Shells? Whatever for?<br> Oh, you know. The old shell game?<br> Daphne, you're bothering us.<br> - Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.<br> - I am?<br> He said he'd come<br> to hear us play - maybe.<br> What do you mean, maybe? I saw the way<br> he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.<br> I hope so.<br> What do you think, Josephine?<br> What does your crystal ball say?<br> Sugar. Is Sugar in here?<br> Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out<br> and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.<br> See you on the bandstand, girls.<br> What are you tryin' to do to that girl,<br> puttin' on a millionaire act?<br> And that phoney accent?<br> Nobody talks like that.<br> I've seen you pull<br> some low tricks on women.<br> This is without doubt<br> the trickiest, lowest, meanest...<br> I'm not afraid of you.<br> I'm thin, but I'm wiry.<br> You're gonna get hurt.<br> When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.<br> Joe. Don't look at me like that.<br> It was all a joke. I didn't mean any harm.<br> I'm gonna press<br> the suit myself. Telephone.<br> Answer the tele...phone.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, this is 413.<br> Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.<br> Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.<br> You know - Osgood? ln the elevator?<br> You slapped my face?<br> - Who is this?<br> - This is her roommate.<br> Daphne can't talk right now. Is it urgent?<br> Well, it is to me.<br> Will you give her a message?<br> Tell her I'd like her to have supper with<br> me on my yacht after the show tonight.<br> Got it. Supper, yacht,<br> after the show. I'll tell her.<br> - Your yacht?<br> - The New Caledonia. That's its name.<br> The Old Caledonia went down<br> during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.<br> But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet<br> little midnight snack, just the two of us.<br> Just the two of you?<br> What about the crew?<br> That's all been taken care of.<br> I'm giving them shore leave.<br> We'll have cold pheasant<br> with champagne.<br> I've checked with the coastguard.<br> There's gonna be a full moon tonight.<br> And tell her I've got<br> a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.<br> That's good thinking.<br> Daphne's a pushover for him.<br> Pushover for who? What...<br> Yes, Mr Fielding.<br> You'll pick her up after the show<br> in your motorboat. Goodbye.<br> What's that you said?<br> - "Zowie." I'll give her the message.<br> - What message? What motorboat?<br> You got it made. Fielding wants to have<br> cold pheasant with you on his yacht.<br> Just the three of you on that<br> great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.<br> Fat chance. Call him back<br> and say I'm not goin'.<br> Of course you're not.<br> I'm going.<br> You're gonna be on the boat<br> with that dirty old man?<br> I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.<br> - Where's he gonna be?<br> - He's gonna be ashore with you.<br> - With me?<br> - That's right.<br> Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.<br> Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.<br> You can both go take a flyin' jump.<br> Remember, he's your date<br> for tonight, so smile.<br> Oh, you can do better than that.<br> Give him the teeth, the whole personality.<br> Why do I let you talk me<br> into these things? Why?<br> Because we're pals. The two musketeers.<br> Don't give me the musketeers.<br> How am I gonna keep him ashore?<br> Tell him you get seasick.<br> Play miniature golf with him.<br> Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught<br> in a miniature sand trap with that guy.<br> Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?<br> Bull fiddle.<br> From satchel mouth at table seven.<br> - This is from me to you, doll.<br> - Beat it, buster.<br> Never mind leaving your door open.<br> I got a passkey.<br> - What are you doin' with my flowers?<br> - Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.<br> I guess he's not gonna show up.<br> It's five minutes to one.<br> - Do you suppose he forgot?<br> - You know how those millionaires are.<br> These came for you.<br> For me?<br> It's Shell Oil.<br> - No!<br> - Yes!<br> He wants to have supper<br> with me on his yacht.<br> He's picking me up at the pier.<br> - No!<br> - Yes.<br> You heard her - yes.<br> Josephine, just imagine. Me,<br> Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,<br> on a millionaire's yacht.<br> If my mother could only see me now.<br> I hope my mother never finds out.<br> That's it for tonight.<br> This is Sweet Sue saying good night,<br> reminding all you daddies out there<br> that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.<br> And I intend to keep it that way.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Thanks.<br> But it's such a waste.<br> A full moon, an empty yacht.<br> - I'll throw up.<br> - Then let's go dancing.<br> There's a roadhouse down the coast...<br> Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.<br> Who?<br> About the roadhouse?<br> They have a Cuban band<br> that's the berries.<br> Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra<br> and tango till dawn.<br> - You know something, Mr Fielding?<br> - What?<br> You're dynamite.<br> You're a pretty hot<br> little firecracker yourself.<br> Ahoy, there.<br> Ahoy.<br> - Been waiting long?<br> - It's not how long you wait.<br> - It's who you're waiting for.<br> - Thank you. And for the flowers.<br> I wanted them to fly orchids from our<br> greenhouse, but Long lsland is fogged in.<br> It's the thought that counts.<br> I seem to be out of gas.<br> It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.<br> I mean, Shell Oil and everything.<br> Oops. There.<br> It seems to be stuck in reverse.<br> I just got this motorboat.<br> It's an an experimental model.<br> It seems like they're on the wrong track.<br> Do you mind riding backwards?<br> It may take a little longer.<br> It's not how long it takes.<br> It's who's taking you.<br> It looked so small from the beach.<br> But when you're on it, it's like<br> a cruiser or a destroyer.<br> It's just regulation-size. We have three.<br> Mother keeps hers in Southampton.<br> Daddy's is in Venezuela.<br> The company is laying a new pipeline.<br> My dad's more interested in railroads.<br> Baltimore and Ohio.<br> Which is the port<br> and which is the starboard?<br> That depends on<br> whether you're coming or going.<br> I mean, normally the aft<br> is on the other side of the stern.<br> And that's the bridge. So that you can get<br> from one side of the boat to the other.<br> - Would you like a glass of champagne?<br> - Love it. Which way?<br> - You have an upstairs and a downstairs.<br> - Yes, the hurricane cellar.<br> And another nice thing about<br> this yacht - Iots of closet space.<br> Now, let me see. Where do you<br> suppose the steward set it up?<br> In here.<br> Of course. How silly of me.<br> On Thursdays they always<br> serve me in the small salon.<br> It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.<br> It's all right for a bachelor.<br> - What a beautiful fish.<br> - I caught him off Cape Hatteras.<br> What is it?<br> It's a member of the herring family.<br> A herring?<br> Isn't it amazing how they get those<br> big fish into those little glass jars?<br> They shrink when they're marinated.<br> - Champagne?<br> - I don't mind if I do.<br> Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.<br> Bon voyage.<br> - Look at all that silverware.<br> - Trophies.<br> You know. Skeet shooting,<br> dog breeding, water polo.<br> Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?<br> I'll say. I had two ponies<br> drowned under me.<br> Where's your shell collection?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Where could they have put it?<br> You see, on Thursdays<br> I'm sort of lost around here.<br> - What's on Thursdays?<br> - It's the crew's night off.<br> - You mean we're alone on the boat?<br> - Completely.<br> I've never been completely alone<br> with a man in the middle of the night,<br> - in the middle of the ocean.<br> - Oh, it's perfectly safe.<br> We're anchored.<br> The ship's in shipshape shape.<br> The coastguard will call<br> if any icebergs appear.<br> It's not the icebergs.<br> But certain men would try to<br> take advantage of a situation like this.<br> - You're flattering me.<br> - Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.<br> It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.<br> - Harmless? How?<br> - I don't know how to put it,<br> but I've got this thing about girls.<br> - What thing?<br> - They just sort of leave me cold.<br> You mean, like, frigid?<br> Well, it's more like a mental block.<br> When I'm with a girl,<br> it does absolutely nothing to me.<br> - Have you tried?<br> - Have l. I'm trying all the time.<br> See? Nothing.<br> - Nothing at all?<br> - Complete washout.<br> - That makes me feel just awful.<br> - My dear, it's not your fault.<br> Now and then Mother Nature<br> throws somebody a dirty curve.<br> Something goes wrong inside.<br> - You mean you can't fall in love?<br> - Not any more.<br> I was in love once,<br> but I'd rather not talk about it.<br> - Would you like a little cold pheasant?<br> - What happened?<br> - I don't want to bore you.<br> - You couldn't possibly.<br> Well...<br> It was my freshman year at Princeton.<br> There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.<br> Her father was<br> the vice president of Hupmobile.<br> She wore glasses, too.<br> That summer we were<br> at the Grand Canyon.<br> We were on the highest ledge<br> watching the sunset,<br> when suddenly we got<br> this impulse to kiss.<br> I took off my glasses.<br> She took off her glasses.<br> I took a step toward her.<br> She took a step toward me.<br> Yes. Eight hours later<br> they brought her up by mule.<br> I gave her three transfusions.<br> We had the same type blood - type O.<br> But it was too late.<br> Talk about sad.<br> Ever since then,<br> numb, no feelings, like my heart<br> was shot full of Novocain.<br> You poor, poor boy.<br> Yes. All the money in the world,<br> and what good is it?<br> Mint sauce or cranberries?<br> How can you think about food<br> at a time like this?<br> What else is there for me?<br> - Is it that hopeless?<br> - My family did everything they could.<br> Hired the most beautiful<br> French upstairs maids.<br> Got a special tutor to read me<br> books that were banned in Boston.<br> Imported a troupe of Balinese dancers<br> with those bells on their ankles<br> and long fingernails.<br> What a waste of money.<br> Have you ever tried American girls?<br> Why?<br> Was that anything?<br> Thanks just the same.<br> You should see a doctor - a good doctor.<br> I have. I spent six months in Vienna<br> with Professor Freud, flat on my back.<br> Then there were the Mayo brothers,<br> injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.<br> If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.<br> Don't say that.<br> There must be some girl<br> someplace that could...<br> If I ever found a girl that could,<br> I'd marry her just like that.<br> - Would you do me a favour?<br> - Certainly. What is it?<br> I may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother<br> or one of those French upstairs girls,<br> but could I take another crack at it?<br> All right, if you insist.<br> - Anything this time?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Terribly sorry.<br> - Would you like some more champagne?<br> Maybe if we had some music.<br> How do you dim these lights?<br> Look, it's terribly sweet of you<br> to want to help out, but it's no use.<br> I think the light switch is over there.<br> That's the radio.<br> It's like taking someone<br> to a concert when he's tone-deaf.<br> You're not giving yourself a chance.<br> Don't fight it.<br> Relax.<br> It's like smoking without inhaling.<br> So inhale.<br> Daphne,<br> - you're leading again.<br> - Sorry.<br> Well?<br> I'm not quite sure.<br> Would you try it again?<br> I got a funny sensation in my toes.<br> Like someone was barbecuing them<br> over a slow flame.<br> Let's throw another log on the fire.<br> I think you're on the right track.<br> I must be. Your glasses<br> are beginning to steam up.<br> I never knew it could be like this.<br> Thank you.<br> They told me I was kaput,<br> finished, all washed up.<br> And here you are, making a chump<br> out of all those experts.<br> Mineral baths. Now, really.<br> Where did you learn to kiss like that?<br> I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.<br> Tomorrow, remind me to send<br> a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.<br> Whoops.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good morning.<br> How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?<br> $850,000.<br> Let's make it an even million.<br> I forgot to give you a receipt.<br> Hi, Jerry. Everything under control?<br> Have I got things to tell you.<br> - What happened?<br> - I'm engaged.<br> Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?<br> I am.<br> What?<br> Osgood proposed to me.<br> We're planning a June wedding.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You can't marry Osgood.<br> - Do you think he's too old for me?<br> - Jerry, you can't be serious.<br> Why not? He keeps<br> marryin' girls all the time.<br> But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.<br> And why would a guy<br> wanna marry a guy?<br> Security.<br> - Jerry, lie down. You're not well.<br> - Stop treatin' me like a child.<br> - I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.<br> - I'll say there is.<br> His mother. We need her approval. But<br> I'm not worried because I don't smoke.<br> - Jerry, there's another problem.<br> - Like what?<br> - Like your honeymoon.<br> - We've been discussing that.<br> He wants to go to the Riviera,<br> but I kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.<br> Jerry, you're outta your mind.<br> You can't get away with this.<br> I don't expect it to last.<br> I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.<br> - Like when?<br> - Like right after the ceremony.<br> Then we get a quick annulment,<br> he makes a nice settlement on me<br> and I keep gettin' those<br> alimony cheques every month.<br> Jerry, listen to me.<br> There are laws, conventions.<br> It's just not been done.<br> Joe, this may be my last chance<br> to marry a millionaire.<br> Jerry, will you take my advice?<br> Forget about the whole thing, will you?<br> Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.<br> - I'm a boy.<br> - That's the boy.<br> I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...<br> I wish I were dead.<br> I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am I a boy.<br> What about my engagement present?<br> - What engagement present?<br> - Osgood gave me a bracelet.<br> Hey, these are real diamonds.<br> Of course they're real.<br> You think my fianc is a bum?<br> - I guess I'll have to give it back to him.<br> - Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.<br> After all, we don't wanna<br> hurt Osgood's feelings.<br> - Just a minute.<br> - It's me. Sugar.<br> Come in.<br> I thought I heard voices. I had to talk to<br> somebody. I don't feel like going to sleep.<br> - What you need is a slug of bourbon.<br> - Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.<br> - Did you have a nice time?<br> - Nice?<br> It was suicidally beautiful.<br> Did he get fresh?<br> Of course not. As a matter of fact,<br> it was just the other way around.<br> - You see, he needs help.<br> - What for?<br> Talk about elegant.<br> You should see the yacht.<br> Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.<br> Gee, I wish I'd been there.<br> I'm going to see him again<br> tonight - and every night.<br> I think he's going to propose.<br> - As soon as he gets up his nerve.<br> - That's some nerve.<br> Daphne got a proposal tonight.<br> - Really?<br> - From a rich millionaire.<br> That's wonderful.<br> - Poor Josephine.<br> - Me?<br> Well, Daphne has a beau, I have a beau...<br> If we could only find somebody for you.<br> Here I am, doll.<br> "Friends of ltalian Opera" - that's us.<br> Register over there.<br> Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.<br> South Side Chapter.<br> Thanks.<br> Hiya, Spats.<br> - We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.<br> - Why wouldn't l?<br> We thought you was all broken up<br> about Toothpick Charlie.<br> - We all gotta go sometime.<br> - Yeah. You never know who's next.<br> OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.<br> - What for?<br> - Orders from Little Bonaparte.<br> - All right, Spats, get your hands up.<br> - What's the idea?<br> Little Bonaparte don't want<br> no hardware around.<br> All right, you're clean.<br> You're not.<br> It ain't loaded.<br> Next. What's in here?<br> My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.<br> - What's this?<br> - My mashie.<br> See you at the banquet, Spats.<br> Where did you pick up that cheap trick?<br> Come on, boys.<br> Well. Spats Colombo, if I ever saw one.<br> Hello, copper.<br> What brings you to Florida?<br> I heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.<br> Thought I'd come in case<br> anybody decided to sing.<br> Big joke.<br> Where were you at 3pm<br> on St Valentine's Day?<br> - I was at Rigoletto.<br> - What's his first name and address?<br> It's an opera, you ignoramus.<br> - In the garage on Clark Street?<br> - Clark Street? Never heard of it.<br> Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners<br> on Wabash Avenue?<br> The day after the shoot<br> you sent in spats with blood on 'em.<br> I cut myself while shaving.<br> - You shave with spats on?<br> - I sleep with my spats on.<br> Stop kidding. You vulcanised<br> Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.<br> You and who else?<br> Me and those two witnesses you<br> have been lookin' for all over Chicago.<br> Boys, know anything about<br> any garage or witnesses?<br> Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.<br> Honest.<br> Don't worry, Spats. One of these days<br> we're gonna dig up those two guys.<br> That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.<br> I feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery<br> from a man under false pretences.<br> Get it while you're young. Fix your lips<br> if you wanna look nice for Osgood.<br> It'll break his heart when<br> he finds out I can't marry him.<br> It'll break Sugar's heart when<br> she finds out I'm not a millionaire.<br> Can't make an omelette<br> without breakin' an egg.<br> - What's with the omelette?<br> - Nag, nag, nag.<br> We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got<br> Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.<br> - Joe!<br> - What?<br> Something tells me the omelette<br> is about to hit the fan.<br> Come on, Daphne.<br> - Going up.<br> - Hold it.<br> Three, please.<br> I don't mean to be forward,<br> but ain't I had the pleasure<br> of meetin' you two broads before?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - You must mean two other broads.<br> - You ever been in Chicago?<br> - Us?<br> We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.<br> Third floor.<br> - What floor are you on, sweetie?<br> - Never you mind.<br> Room 413. We'll be in touch.<br> Don't call us. We'll call you.<br> I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.<br> They're gonna line us up<br> against the wall and...<br> The cops will find two dead dames<br> and take us to the morgue<br> and when they undress us,<br> I'll die of shame.<br> - Shut up and keep packing.<br> - Yeah. OK, Joe.<br> - Not that, you idiot.<br> - They're from Osgood.<br> He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.<br> I tell you, I will never find<br> another man who's so good to me.<br> Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,<br> we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,<br> grab a boat to South America<br> and hide out in a banana republic.<br> I figured if we eat nothing but bananas,<br> we could live there for 50 years.<br> If we get outta the hotel alive.<br> - Did we forget anything?<br> - Yeah. The shaving stuff.<br> - And also Sugar.<br> - Sugar?<br> - Give me room 414.<br> - What are you doin'?<br> - Making a telephone call.<br> - Who has time?<br> We can't walk out on her<br> without a goodbye.<br> You usually walk out and leave 'em<br> with a kick in the teeth.<br> That's when I was a saxophone player.<br> Now I'm a millionaire.<br> Mail her a postcard.<br> Those gorillas may be here any minute.<br> Room 414?<br> This is the ship-to-shore operator.<br> Ship to shore?<br> Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.<br> Hello, my dearest darling.<br> It's good to hear your voice.<br> I may throw up.<br> No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.<br> To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.<br> I never slept better.<br> I had the most wonderful dream.<br> I was still on the yacht<br> and the anchor broke loose.<br> We drifted for days and days.<br> You were the captain and I was the crew.<br> I kept a lookout for icebergs, I sorted<br> your shells and mixed your cocktails,<br> and I wiped the steam off your glasses.<br> And when I woke up, I wanted<br> to swim right back to you.<br> Yes...<br> Now, about our date for tonight...<br> I'll meet you on the pier again<br> right after the show.<br> I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.<br> Not tomorrow either. I have to leave.<br> Something unexpected came up.<br> I'm sailing right away.<br> Where to?<br> South America?<br> That is unexpected.<br> You see, we have<br> these oil interests in Venezuela.<br> I just got a cable from Dad. The board<br> of directors have decided on a merger.<br> A merger? How long will you be gone?<br> Quite a while.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I'm not coming back at all.<br> You're not?<br> Well, it's all rather complicated.<br> What we call high finance.<br> It just so happens the president of the<br> Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...<br> Oh. That kind of merger.<br> What is she like?<br> According to our tax adviser,<br> she's only so-so.<br> But that's the way the oil gushes.<br> A man in my position<br> has a responsibility to the stockholders.<br> All those little people<br> who have invested their life savings.<br> Of course. I understand.<br> At least, I think I do.<br> I knew you would. I only wish there<br> was something I could do for you.<br> But you have. You've given me<br> all that inside information.<br> Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker<br> and have him buy me<br> Smart move.<br> By the way, did you get my flowers?<br> You know, those orchids<br> from my greenhouse?<br> The fog finally lifted over Long lsland<br> and they flew them down this morning.<br> That's strange. I sent 'em to your room.<br> They should have been delivered by now.<br> Hey, Dolores, will you see<br> if there's any flowers outside?<br> Yes, they're here. White orchids.<br> I haven't had white orchids<br> since I was a debutante.<br> What's this?<br> What's what?<br> Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.<br> Real diamonds.<br> They must be worth their weight in gold.<br> Are you always this generous?<br> Not always.<br> I wanted you to know how grateful<br> I am for what you did for me.<br> I didn't do anything. It just happened.<br> The navigator just came in.<br> We're ready to cast off.<br> Well, anchors aweigh,<br> and have a bon voyage.<br> If you need an orchestra<br> to play at your wedding,<br> we'll be through here<br> in a couple of weeks.<br> Goodbye, my darling.<br> I don't know about the captain but<br> the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.<br> - Yeah, let's shove off.<br> - Wait a minute. My bracelet.<br> What happened to my bracelet?<br> - Your bracelet? It's ours.<br> - All right. What happened to our bracelet?<br> - We did the right thing with it.<br> - You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.<br> No tricks, no mirrors,<br> nothing up my sleeve.<br> It's on the level this time.<br> Where's that bourbon?<br> - What's the matter, Sugar?<br> - I don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.<br> How did you get that bracelet?<br> - You like it?<br> - I always did.<br> Junior gave it to me. He's gone<br> to South America to marry another girl.<br> - That's what you call high finance.<br> - That's what I call a louse.<br> If I were you, I'd take that bracelet<br> and throw it back in his face.<br> He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.<br> The only one that ever gave me anything.<br> You'll forget him, Sugar.<br> How can l? No matter where I go, there'll<br> always be a Shell station on every corner.<br> I'll bring this back when it's empty.<br> Are you crazy? The place<br> is crawlin' with mobsters.<br> And you're makin' like<br> Diamond Jim Brady.<br> How are we gonna get outta here?<br> How are we gonna eat?<br> - We'll walk. If we have to, we'll starve.<br> - There's that "we" again.<br> Not that way. We don't wanna<br> run into Spats and his chums.<br> Your hands clean?<br> Over.<br> OK, button my spats.<br> You sure dress nice, boss.<br> Say, boss. I've been talking<br> with the other delegates.<br> The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore<br> over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.<br> - Him and Charlie was choirboys together.<br> - Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.<br> He even got Charlie's last toothpick<br> from the garage. Had it gold-plated.<br> Like I was tellin' you fellas.<br> Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.<br> Hasn't got it here any more.<br> Used to be like a rock.<br> - It's too bad. I think it's time he retired.<br> - Second the motion.<br> How are we gonna retire him?<br> Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.<br> Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie<br> will be singin' in the same choir again.<br> But this time we'll make sure<br> there are no witnesses.<br> Look. The two broads from the elevator.<br> Hey. Join us.<br> What's the matter with those dames?<br> Maybe those dames ain't dames.<br> Same faces, same instruments.<br> - Here's your Valentine's card.<br> - The two musicians from the garage.<br> They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,<br> so we'll finish the job here. Come on.<br> - All right, so what do we do now?<br> - First we gotta get out of these clothes.<br> What happened?<br> Me and Tiny had them cornered,<br> but we lost them in the shuffle.<br> - Where were you guys?<br> - We was with you, at Rigoletto's.<br> - Why, you stupid idiot.<br> - Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.<br> They can't be too far away.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.<br> It's been ten years since I elected myself<br> president of this organisation,<br> and, if I say so myself,<br> you made the right choice.<br> Let's look at the record.<br> In the last fiscal year,<br> we made $112 million before taxes.<br> Only we ain't payin' no taxes.<br> Of course, like in every business,<br> we had our little misunderstandings.<br> Let us now observe one minute of silence<br> in memory of seven of our members<br> from Chicago, North Side Chapter,<br> who are unable to be with us tonight<br> on account of bein' rubbed out.<br> You too, Spats.<br> Up.<br> Easy, now.<br> - You know when you come out?<br> - Yeah. Second time they sing:<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> which nobody can deny.<br> OK.<br> And don't mess up the cake. I promised<br> to bring back a piece to my kids.<br> Now, fellow delegates,<br> there comes a time in the life<br> of every business executive<br> when he starts thinkin' about retirement.<br> No!<br> I'm lookin' around<br> for somebody to fill my shoes.<br> I've been considerin' several candidates.<br> For instance, there's<br> a certain party from Chicago,<br> South Side Chapter.<br> Now, some people say<br> he's gotten a little too big for his spats.<br> But I say he's a man who'll go far.<br> Some people say he's gone too far.<br> But I say,<br> you can't keep a good man down.<br> Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.<br> The big noise he made<br> on St Valentine's Day,<br> that wasn't very good for public relations.<br> And lettin' them two witnesses get away.<br> That sure was careless.<br> Don't worry about those two.<br> They're as good as dead.<br> I almost caught up with them today.<br> You mean you let 'em get away twice?<br> Some people would say<br> that's real sloppy.<br> But I say: to err is human,<br> to forgive divine.<br> And just to show you<br> what I think of you, Spats,<br> the boys told me<br> you was gonna have a birthday.<br> So we baked you a little cake.<br> My birthday?<br> Why, it ain't for another four months.<br> So we're a little early.<br> What's a few months between friends?<br> All right, boys. Now all together.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> Which nobody can deny.<br> Which nobody can deny.<br> Which nobody can deny.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> Which nobody can deny.<br> Big joke.<br> Let's get outta here.<br> Get those two guys.<br> What happened here?<br> There was somethin' in that cake<br> that didn't agree with 'em.<br> My compliments to the chef. Nobody<br> leaves this room till I get the recipe.<br> You wanna make a federal case of it?<br> Yeah.<br> They slipped through our hands.<br> We're watchin' the train station, roads<br> and airport. They can't get away.<br> - Did you hear that?<br> - But they're not watching yachts.<br> - You're gonna call Osgood.<br> - What'll I tell him?<br> Tell him you're gonna elope with him.<br> Elope? But there are laws, conventions.<br> There's a convention, all right.<br> There's also the ladies' morgue.<br> Josephine.<br> Bienstock!<br> Hey. That's no dame.<br> None of that, Sugar.<br> No guy is worth it.<br> Grab her.<br> Josephine?<br> - Osgood's meeting us at the pier.<br> - We're not on the pier yet.<br> Hi.<br> My friend Josephine,<br> gonna be a bridesmaid.<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> - Come on.<br> She's so eager.<br> Wait for Sugar!<br> - Another bridesmaid?<br> - Flower girl.<br> - Sugar, what are you doing?<br> - I told you, I'm not very bright.<br> Let's go.<br> You don't want me, Sugar.<br> I'm a liar and a phoney.<br> A saxophone player.<br> One of those no-goodniks<br> you keep running away from.<br> I know. Every time.<br> Sugar, do yourself a favour.<br> Go back to the millionaires.<br> The sweet end of the lollipop,<br> not the coleslaw in the face<br> and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.<br> That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.<br> I called Mama.<br> She was so happy, she cried.<br> She wants you to have<br> her wedding gown. It's white lace.<br> Osgood, I can't get married<br> in your mother's dress.<br> She and l, we are not built the same way.<br> - We can have it altered.<br> - Oh no, you don't.<br> Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.<br> We can't get married at all.<br> Why not?<br> Well...<br> In the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> I smoke. I smoke all the time.<br> I don't care.<br> I have a terrible past. For three years<br> I've been living with a saxophone player.<br> I forgive you.<br> I can never have children.<br> - We can adopt some.<br> - You don't understand, Osgood.<br> - I'm a man.<br> - Well,<br> nobody's perfect.<br>
