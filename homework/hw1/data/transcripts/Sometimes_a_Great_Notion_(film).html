Whoo!<br> Hang in there!<br> Floyd, come on!<br> Easy, Floyd. Easy.<br> God damn,<br> strike-breaking bastards.<br> I got you, Floyd.<br> I got you, Floyd.<br> It'll be OK.<br> My God...<br> They could've killed me.<br> Did they get you?<br> Are you hurt?<br> You all right?<br> You lousy gypo<br> scabber bastards!<br> We'll get you!<br> We're gonna pull you down.<br> [Radio plays country music]<br> Look!<br> [Speaking unclearly]<br> with the dynamite...<br> Boom! I though you put<br> it right in the boat!<br> God damn union freaks.<br> Teach you to go<br> snoopin' around.<br> And then someone<br> over there is yelling,<br> "Look out!"<br> How's he gonna look out,<br> if the boat's going<br> all over the damn river?<br> He's screaming and yelling,<br> "What's happening to me?<br> What's happening to me?."<br> What'd I tell you?<br> The holy signals<br> are hanging over us<br> right now, Hank.<br> I mean,<br> everything's going<br> to be milk and honey.<br> We're in God's own fat pocket.<br> Brother Walker told us that.<br> He told us.<br> Yeah.<br> And he don't hand out any crap<br> Iike some of them<br> other preachers do.<br> God damn, some people<br> would rather talk than eat.<br> Ah, it's washing out<br> down here, Joe.<br> Give me a hand, will ya?<br> Hank, Joe B.!<br> You boys planning on a stag<br> party here tonight?<br> We got women inside.<br> This ain't no party, bub.<br> This here is<br> Mr. Jonathan Draeger.<br> Pleasure to meet you both.<br> He's the whole works,<br> bub. He's the president.<br> Not just Oregon.<br> The whole damn freakin' union.<br> Yeah, I think<br> I know that, Floyd.<br> Boy, you sure picked<br> one hell of a night<br> for a moonlight cruise.<br> Yeah, it is that.<br> I was working over<br> in Portland today.<br> And I thought I might stop by<br> and chat for a few<br> minutes before we left.<br> OK. Go ahead.<br> Well, is it asking<br> too much of an old buddy<br> if we get in out of the rain?<br> Come on.<br> No sense in tracking<br> all of this water<br> into the house, Floyd.<br> We can talk out here.<br> Henry, it's Jonathan Draeger.<br> How are you?<br> How you do, sir?<br> Viv, bring out<br> a couple of six-packs<br> of cold ones, will ya?<br> Oh, boy.<br> This weather up here<br> really plays hell<br> with my athlete's foot.<br> Seems like any time<br> I come up to Oregon,<br> it just crawls right up<br> to my privates.<br> Yeah. Well, I hope the<br> trip will be worth it.<br> Could we cut the fun and games<br> and get to the point?<br> Well, you got to think<br> I'm kind of arrogant<br> to barge in here<br> to plug up the holes, Hank.<br> Is it all right<br> if I call you Hank?<br> What do you think, Henry?<br> It's OK by me.<br> He's the boss.<br> Well, I was just wondering<br> if maybe you can hold on<br> to everything you've got now<br> and then sell it all later on.<br> Sell it to somebody else maybe.<br> Sure.<br> Sure. We'll tell<br> the O'Connel Company<br> to go screw themselves.<br> I guess that gives us<br> the privilege<br> of selling our logs<br> to somebody else.<br> I get you.<br> Well then?<br> Well then what?<br> Can't do that, Floyd.<br> By God, you've got to do it.<br> Look, we got a contract,<br> Mr. Draeger.<br> How do you handle that?<br> I mean, that's our word.<br> Draeger: Shouldn't have<br> gave your word.<br> No, thanks. Listen, I know.<br> We've got nothing against<br> you independents.<br> We're not out to put<br> the family operations<br> out of business.<br> Thanks.<br> That clears that up.<br> I mean, they're<br> your friends and neighbors.<br> Don't you think<br> you owe 'em something?<br> That depends<br> on what they'd owe us<br> if they were on the other end.<br> Oh, come on now. You know<br> what I'm talking about.<br> See, I don't think I do know<br> what you're talking about.<br> You come on pretty folksy<br> with that athlete's foot<br> and those first names<br> and everything.<br> Why don't we cut through that<br> crap and get straight on it?<br> That suits me fine.<br> But what am I going to tell you?<br> You got a town full of people<br> here who are hurting.<br> Now somebody is going<br> to have to give up something<br> somewhere along the line.<br> Don't you agree?<br> Henry, you answer that.<br> Well, now,<br> it just so happens, see,<br> we get ourselves up<br> at 4:30 every morning,<br> go out and chop wood.<br> It's every morning<br> but Sunday for sure.<br> And Saturday maybe.<br> We've been doing that<br> for a hell of a lot of<br> years with no stink.<br> So when you or Floyd here<br> or General Motors<br> or some Commie-pinko<br> or my hound dog tells us<br> we're not going to get<br> up at 4:30, I tell you...<br> you haven't got a whisper<br> of a bare-ass clue what the hell<br> this family's all about.<br> Not a whisper.<br> Nothing.<br> Well, that's just about<br> as clear a statement<br> of 19th-century philosophy<br> as I've ever heard.<br> Fine. Give us a look<br> at the 20th.<br> Your slots and compartments<br> you stash people away in.<br> You gonna tell us<br> when to stop cutting<br> and when to start cutting.<br> And who to sell to,<br> and pat our little bottoms<br> and tell us<br> what good little boys we are.<br> Well, not yet, bub.<br> Not yet you don't.<br> I'm only asking you to hang onto<br> the logs you already have.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> Might gladden your heart<br> and dry up your<br> athlete's foot overnight.<br> We might not make that deadline.<br> We got three weeks of the worst<br> logging coming up.<br> And we're liable to fall short.<br> But let me tell you something.<br> We are going<br> to bust our humps trying.<br> I'm really sorry<br> you feel that way.<br> Every time you open up<br> a paper these days,<br> you read about violence.<br> It's almost as if nothing<br> gets done anymore without it.<br> So, if these people here...<br> Wait a minute.<br> I think we're down<br> to the gritty, Henry.<br> If you're talking threats,<br> I think you can make them<br> plainer than that.<br> Just what kind of violence<br> do you have in mind?<br> I'm just pointing out the facts,<br> that's all.<br> Your friends<br> and neighbors here,<br> they say<br> you're strike breaking.<br> You say, you're bound<br> to honor your word.<br> So that's the way it stands.<br> Well, I only speak<br> for the union.<br> We have no jurisdiction<br> over family operations.<br> So the union's out of it<br> from now on.<br> It's between you people.<br> Whatever happens from here<br> on out, the union's out of it.<br> I'm glad to have met you,<br> Mr. Stamper.<br> My father was a good friend<br> of your father<br> many long years ago.<br> Ah. What was his name?<br> Til Draeger.<br> Never heard of him.<br> Thanks for your hospitality.<br> Goodnight.<br> Well...<br> Hmm?<br> Yeah, we better get back<br> to work on that, Joe.<br> [Chopping]<br> Tide'll be coming in<br> like hell tonight.<br> Oh, it's always coming<br> in like hell.<br> Like it or not,<br> it's going to carry us<br> all off someday.<br> [Church bell ringing]<br> This is it, buddy.<br> Huh?<br> OK. Thanks for the ride.<br> Bye bye.<br> [Whistles]<br> Hey!<br> [Whistling]<br> Joey. Good day, rigger.<br> Yeah, Hank, I get ya.<br> [Bell ringing]<br> Who's doing all that<br> raging over there?<br> Oh, I can't tell from here.<br> I'm going to go see though.<br> What can I do for ya?<br> Wish I knew, Joe B.<br> Huh?<br> Oh, you sure haven't<br> changed much, Joe B.<br> All right, come on now.<br> Just who the hell are you?<br> I'm Lee, Joe B.<br> Leland.<br> You're Lee?<br> Can't believe it.<br> Huh!<br> My God...<br> Lee, what's all that crap<br> hanging down your head.<br> Can we go over now?<br> Why sure, boy.<br> Get in and we're off<br> and sailing, boy.<br> Hey, Hank!<br> Uncle Henry, I got Lee!<br> I got Leland Stamper!<br> I got Lee!

Hi.<br> I'm Viv. Hank's wife.<br> How you do?<br> Why don't you come on up?<br> Hank's around here someplace.<br> At least he was<br> a few minutes ago.<br> Hank: How are you, swinger?<br> Never thought you'd get<br> back here on your own.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I guess it is<br> kinda strange.<br> What are you,<br> just passing through?<br> Maybe.<br> What do you think, Henry?<br> Want to put this puppy<br> dog up for the night?<br> I don't know.
