                        In the last century<br> before the birth...<br> of the new faith<br> called Christianity...<br> which was destined to overthrow<br> the pagan tyranny of Rome...<br> and bring about a new society...<br> the Roman republic stood at the very<br> centre of the civilized world.<br> "Of all things fairest. "<br> sang the poet...<br> "first among cities and<br> home of the gods is golden Rome. "<br> Yet even at the zenith<br> of her pride and power...<br> the Republic lay fatally stricken<br> with a disease called...<br> human slavery.<br> The age of the dictator<br> was at hand...<br> waiting in the shadows<br> for the event to bring it forth.<br> In that same century...<br> in the conquered<br> Greek province of Thrace...<br> an illiterate slave woman<br> added to her master's wealth...<br> by giving birth to a son<br> whom she named Spartacus.<br> A proud. rebellious son...<br> who was sold to living death<br> in the mines of Libya...<br> before his thirteenth birthday.<br> There. under whip<br> and chain and sun...<br> he lived out his youth<br> and his young manhood...<br> dreaming the death of slavery...<br> before it finally would die.<br> Back to work!<br> Get up, Spartacus,<br> you Thracian dog!<br> Come on, get up!<br> My ankle, my ankle!<br> My ankle!<br> Spartacus again?<br> This time he dies.<br> Back to work, all of you!<br> - Welcome, Lentulus Batiatus.<br> - Welcome, indeed, my dear captain.<br> Eleven miles<br> through the disastrous heat...<br> and the cost<br> of hiring an escort-- ruinous.<br> Even so, I warrant you have nothing<br> fiit to sell me, have you, Captain?<br> I've wasted my time and my money.<br> Tell me the truth.<br> I think we have a few<br> you might be interested in.<br> What, these? Carrion!<br> The buzzards are late.<br> This one here's not bad.<br> He's a Gaul.<br> I don't like Gauls. Hairy.<br> -Can he come down from there unassisted?<br> -Come down, you!<br> Come down!<br> Be good enough<br> to show me the teeth.<br> - Open your mouth!<br> - Thank you.<br> Yes. As the teeth go,<br> so go the bones.<br> This mouth is<br> really impermissible.<br> - The fellow's made of chalk.<br> - We have others. Many others!<br> The sun's over there.<br> I have to pay these people.<br> Who's that?<br> This one's a Thracian.<br> I'm making an example of him.<br> - How?<br> - Starve him to death.<br> It's the only thing impresses slaves.<br> What a pity.<br> He reacts. Good muscle tone.<br> Can I see his teeth?<br> Open your mouth, Spartacus!<br> You smell like a rhinoceros.<br> Captain, you asked him to open<br> his mouth. He doesn't obey you?<br> His teeth are<br> the best thing about him.<br> He hamstrung a guard with them<br> not more than an hour ago.<br> Hamstrung? How marvellous!<br> I wish I'd been here.<br> I'll take him.<br> Let's look at some of the others.<br> Come along!<br> In spite of sickness and death,<br> we will profiit 11,000 sesterces!<br> Including your commission,<br> of course.<br> No, sir.<br> Without my commission.<br> Marcellus, there they are.<br> They're a dirty-looking lot,<br> but it's the best I could fiind.<br> No one else could have made<br> so fiine a choice.<br> Slaves...<br> you have arrived at the gladiatorial<br> school of Lentulus Batiatus.<br> Here you will be trained by experts<br> to fiight in pairs to the death.<br> Obviously, you won't be required<br> to fiight to the death here.<br> That will only be<br> after you've been sold...<br> and then for ladies<br> and gentlemen of quality...<br> those who appreciate<br> a fiine kill.<br> A gladiator's like a stallion:<br> He must be pampered.<br> You'll be oiled, bathed...<br> shaved, massaged,<br> taught to use your heads.<br> A good body with a dull brain<br> is as cheap as life itself!<br> You'll be given<br> your ceremonial caudas.<br> Marcellus, please. There.<br> Be proud of them.<br> On certain special occasions,<br> those of you who please me...<br> will even be given<br> the companionship of a young lady.<br> Approximately half our graduates...<br> Iive for fiive, ten-- ten years.<br> Some of them<br> even attain freedom...<br> and become trainers themselves.<br> Marcellus.<br> I congratulate you.<br> And may fortune smile on most of you.<br> Marcellus, watch the second<br> from the right.<br> He's a Thracian. They were going<br> to kill him for hamstringing a guard.<br> - We'll break him of that.<br> - Don't overdo it. He has quality.<br> Next.<br> Next.<br> I like you.<br> I want you<br> to be my friend.<br> I want to be your friend.<br> All I ask is that<br> you get along with me.<br> What's your name, slave?<br> Spartacus.<br> I feel you don't like me.<br> Give him your sword.<br> Take it!<br> I have a feeling<br> you want to kill me.<br> This is the only chance<br> you'll ever get.<br> Kill me!<br> Don't be afraid, slave.<br> You have that sword.<br> I only have<br> this piece of wood!<br> Are you going<br> to disobey me?<br> Take his sword.<br> You're not as stupid<br> as I thought.<br> You might even be intelligent.<br> That's dangerous for slaves.<br> You just remember...<br> from now on, everything you do,<br> I'll be watching.<br> You did the right thing.<br> Every once in a while, Marcellus likes<br> to kill a man as an example.<br> I think he's picked you.<br> Better watch him.<br> - How long have you been here?<br> - Six months.<br> I wish he'd pick me.<br> I want one chance at that pig<br> before they carry me out!<br> Quiet!<br> No talking down there.<br> You'll get us all in trouble,<br> just like in the mines.<br> What's your name?<br> You don't want<br> to know my name.<br> I don't want<br> to know your name.<br> Just a friendly question.<br> Gladiators don't make friends.<br> If we're ever matched<br> in the arena together...<br> I'll have to kill you.<br> Helena...<br> with Galino.<br> Patricia...<br> Crixus.<br> Priscilla...<br> David.<br> Claudia...<br> Pharox.<br> Varinia...<br> - Dionysius.<br> - No, no. Spartacus.<br> Spartacus.<br> Felicia--<br> I've never had a woman.<br> You have one now, Spartacus.<br> You must take her.<br> - Go away.<br> - What will she think of you?<br> Indeed, what will I think of you?<br> Go away.<br> Come, come. Be generous.<br> We must learn to share our pleasures.<br> I'm not an animal!<br> You're not trying to escape,<br> by any chance?<br> Direct your courage<br> to the girl, Spartacus.<br> I'm not an animal!<br> - I'm not an animal.<br> - Neither am l.<br> What's your name?<br> Varinia.<br> You'll have to take her<br> out of here, Marcellus.<br> You may not be<br> an animal, Spartacus...<br> but this sorry show<br> gives me very little hope...<br> that you'll ever be a man.<br> First rule:<br> You get an instant kill<br> on the red.<br> Here. Here.<br> Always remember:<br> Go for the red fiirst...<br> because if you don't,<br> your opponent will.<br> In the blue,<br> you get a cripple.<br> Here, here...<br> here and here.<br> Second rule:<br> Go for the cripple<br> before the slow kill.<br> Here's a slow kill<br> on the yellow.<br> Here, here...<br> and here.<br> Remember...<br> A slow kill may have enough left<br> in him to kill you before he dies.<br> With a cripple,<br> you know you've got him...<br> if you keep your distance<br> and wear him down.<br> The rest is all right<br> for a public spectacle in Rome...<br> but here at Capua we expect<br> more than simple butchery...<br> and we get it.<br> Spartacus, why are you looking<br> at that girl?<br> Varinia! Stand still.<br> Since all he can do<br> is look at girls...<br> all right, slave,<br> go ahead and look.<br> I said look!<br> No. No, this one<br> goes to the Spaniard.<br> Have a good night's rest,<br> Spartacus.<br> In there.<br> Woman!<br> I've warned you<br> about this kind of thing.<br> All right, bring them in.<br> No talking!<br> Move along there.<br> Did they hurt you?<br> No.<br> That's a kill.<br> One, two...<br> three, four, fiive.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> We have visitors.<br> Tremendous visitors!<br> Two simply enormous Roman lords<br> on the hill.<br> How easily impressed<br> you are, Ramon.<br> Just 'cause they're Romans,<br> I suppose they're enormous.<br> Tell them to wait for me<br> when they arrive.<br> -Master, you don't understand!<br> -How enormous do these Roman lords get?<br> One of them is<br> Marcus Licinius Crassus.<br> What? Wait a minute.<br> Crassus here? Varinia,<br> my red toga with the acorns.<br> And some chairs in the atrium.<br> Second-best wine.<br> No, the best,<br> but small goblets.<br> Gracchus! You know<br> how Crassus loathes him.<br> Take him away.<br> - I can't lift it.<br> - Use your imagination! Cover him.<br> Tell Marcellus<br> to get the men ready.<br> Crassus has expensive taste.<br> He'll want a show of some sort.<br> Forgive me, Gracchus.<br> Marcus Licinius Crassus...<br> most noble radiance...<br> fiirst general of the Republic...<br> father and defender of Rome...<br> honour my house.<br> Bless it with your presence.<br> Wine! Sweetmeats! Can't you see<br> that Their Honours are exhausted?<br> Have the goodness to sit.<br> Is anything wrong,<br> Your Nobility?<br> No.<br> Welcome<br> to the Lady Claudia Maria...<br> former wife<br> of Lucius Caius Marius...<br> whose recent execution<br> touched us all so deeply.<br> Honour to the Lady Helena...<br> daughter of the late<br> Septimus Optimus Glabrus...<br> whose fame shall live on forever<br> in the person of his son...<br> your brother,<br> Marcus Publius Glabrus...<br> hero of the Eastern Wars.<br> How very much he knows.<br> Allow me to bring you<br> up to date.<br> We're here to celebrate the marriage<br> of my brother to the Lady Claudia.<br> A mating of eagles,<br> Your Sanctity!<br> Fan His Magnitude.<br> He sweats.<br> My young friends desire<br> a private showing of two pairs.<br> Two pairs. Oh, yes.<br> I think I have something<br> that would please them.<br> - Two pairs to the death.<br> - To the death, Your Ladyship?<br> Surely you don't think we came<br> all the way to Capua for gymnastics?<br> But I beg Your Honours.<br> Here in Capua we train<br> the fiinest gladiators in all ltaly.<br> We can give you a display<br> of swordsmanship...<br> which is better than anything<br> you can see in Rome at any cost.<br> When they're sold, their new masters<br> may do with them as they wish...<br> but here, no, we never fiight them<br> to the death.<br> Crassus.<br> Today is an exception.<br> But the ill feeling it would spread<br> through the whole school.<br> And then the cost. The cost!<br> Name your price.<br> Arrange it.<br> Are you serious, sir?<br> Arrange it immediately.<br> Of course, we shall want<br> to choose them ourselves.<br> You do have a certain variety,<br> don't you?<br> Yes. Inexhaustible.<br> Spartacus, there's going to be<br> a fiight to the death.<br> - To the death?<br> - How do you know?<br> I heard Marcellus<br> tell one of his guards.<br> - Who fiights?<br> - I don't know.<br> To the death.<br> What if they matched<br> you and me?<br> They won't.<br> What if they did?<br> Would you fiight?<br> I'd have to. So would you.<br> Would you try to kill me?<br> Yes, I'd kill.<br> I'd try to save--<br> I'd try to stay alive<br> and so would you.<br> All gladiators<br> up to the training area.<br> Some visitors<br> want to admire you.<br> Form a line<br> right here in front of me.<br> Would Your Excellencies care<br> to make your selection now?<br> Claudia.<br> They're magnifiicent.<br> For you, Lady Helena...<br> may I suggest Praxus?<br> A veritable tiger.<br> I don't like him.<br> - I prefer that one.<br> - Which one?<br> David?<br> Crixus, yes.<br> Marcellus, Crixus<br> for the short sword.<br> Have you ever seen such a pair<br> of shoulders? Dionysius!<br> I admit he's small, but he's very<br> compact and extremely strong.<br> In fact, he looks--<br> He looks smaller here<br> than he does in the actual arena.<br> Optical.<br> - Give me that one.<br> - Galino.<br> Yes, yes. Galino.<br> You have a shrewd eye, Your Pulchritude,<br> if I may permit myself the--<br> Practically every man in this school<br> is an expert with a Thracian sword...<br> but the trident is something<br> very rare these days.<br> May I suggest...<br> the Ethiopian?<br> There are very few Ethiopians<br> in the country.<br> Ethiopians are recognized<br> as masters of the trident.<br> I'll take him.<br> Draba? Oh, no.<br> For you I want only the best--<br> I want the most beautiful.<br> I'll take the big black one.<br> Very good.<br> Only one man<br> in the entire school...<br> stands a chance with the Thracian knife<br> against the trident.<br> There.<br> - Over there, Lady Helena.<br> - He's impertinent!<br> - I'll take him.<br> - Impertinent, and a coward to boot.<br> Have him flogged!<br> Over there, Lady Helena.<br> The beast of Libya.<br> I prefer the coward.<br> If both men are down<br> and refuse to continue to fiight...<br> your trainer will slit their throats<br> like chickens.<br> - We want no tricks.<br> - Tricks? At the school of Batiatus?<br> You heard the instruction, Marcellus?<br> Remember it.<br> I feel so sorry for the poor things<br> in all this heat.<br> Don't put them<br> in those suffocating tunics.<br> Let them wear just enough<br> for modesty.<br> Whatever they wear, Lady,<br> they'll bless your name.<br> Back, the rest of you!<br> - Our choosing has bored you?<br> - No.<br> Most exciting. I tingle.<br> Do let's get out of the sun.<br> May I conduct Your Magnifiicences<br> to the gallery now?<br> An eavesdropper.<br> Oh, the god!<br> How far from Rome must I go<br> to avoid that cunning face?<br> Crassus, don't talk about Gracchus.<br> He's so hateful.<br> For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician<br> class is a profession...<br> and not such a bad one, either.<br> How else can one become<br> master of the mob...<br> and fiirst senator of Rome?<br> Crassus, it's so boring.<br> I believe that girl smells<br> of perfume.<br> Whatever it is,<br> she smells most delectable.<br> You can't keep slaves from stealing<br> these days unless you chain them.<br> When a slave's as pretty as she is,<br> she doesn't have to steal.<br> An arrangement is made.<br> If her ankles are good...<br> you could be sure<br> an arrangement was made!<br> - Master!<br> - Good heavens, a catastrophe!<br> - I've been anointed!<br> - You trollop!<br> - I believe you did that on purpose.<br> - It was an accident. Come here, girl.<br> Don't be frightened.<br> - What country are you from?<br> - Britannia.<br> How long have you been<br> a slave?<br> Since I was thirteen.<br> You have a certain education.<br> My fiirst master had me tutored<br> for his children.<br> I like her. She has spirit.<br> - I'll buy her.<br> - Buy her, Your Magnifiicence?<br> I have spent<br> quite a lot of money on her.<br> Yes, I've no doubt of it.<br> Two thousand sesterces.<br> Two thou--<br> She'll be waiting at your litter.<br> No, I don't want her feet<br> spoilt by walking.<br> Send her to Rome with your steward<br> the next time he has to go there.<br> He leaves tomorrow<br> and the girl with him.<br> More wine.<br> And thank your gods!<br> You provoke me, Crassus.<br> I shan't be nice to you any more!<br> - Why distress me so much?<br> - You're horribly rich.<br> Yet you're the only one<br> of my brother's friends...<br> who hasn't given him<br> a wedding present.<br> I was saving it<br> for a more suitable moment.<br> Here. Give it to him, child.<br> What is it?<br> As from this moment, your husband<br> is commander of the garrison of Rome.<br> Wonderful!<br> I don't know how I shall<br> ever be able to repay you.<br> Time will solve that mystery.<br> - The garrison of Rome.<br> - Yes.<br> The only power in Rome strong enough<br> to checkmate Gracchus and his senate.<br> You are clever!<br> Open up.<br> Through that door.<br> But you will have<br> to watch him, Claudia.<br> Father almost disinherited him<br> because of slave girls.<br> The marriage contract<br> absolutely forbids a harem.<br> What about your litter bearers?<br> After all, every one of them<br> is under 20...<br> and taller than they should be.<br> She sets rather a high standard<br> for you, does she?<br> Your pleasure, Your Highness.<br> To you, my dear, shall go the honour<br> of starting this poetic drama.<br> Open up!<br> First pair:<br> Crixus and Galino!<br> Those who are about to die<br> salute you.<br> Crixus.<br> Next pair!<br> Those who are about to die,<br> salute you.<br> Your Thracian's doing well.<br> How were you able to get my appointment<br> without Gracchus knowing?<br> I fought fiire with oil.<br> I purchased the senate behind his back.<br> I still think<br> the trident's going to win.<br> - Why doesn't he kill him?<br> - Kill him.<br> What's the matter now?<br> - Kill him!<br> - Kill him, you imbecile!<br> He'll hang there till he rots.<br> Take a last look, Spartacus.<br> She's going to Rome.<br> She's been sold.<br> She's been sold?<br> No talking<br> in the kitchen, slave.<br> There's trouble in the mess hall.<br> They killed Marcellus and maybe others.<br> Call out the guard!<br> Move, move!<br> On second thoughts,<br> I'll deliver the girl personally.<br> Ride to Capua. Call out the garrison.<br> I don't trust this lot.<br> - I hold you responsible.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Around Capua,<br> they ravaged the countryside...<br> forcing other slaves to join them.<br> Looting, robbing,<br> burning everything...<br> while they make their camp<br> in the escarpments of Vesuvius.<br> Each day swells their numbers.<br> The situation presently lies<br> in the hands...<br> of this august body.<br> Where's the mighty Crassus?<br> - Out of the city.<br> - At least you're here.<br> No need to fear for Rome<br> as long as Glabrus is with us.<br> Let me add: Over 100 estates<br> have been burned...<br> among them, gentlemen,<br> y own...<br> burned to the ground<br> and three million sesterces lost.<br> I propose the immediate recall<br> of Pompey and his legions from Spain.<br> - I could bring them in with 500 men!<br> - Don't make a fool of yourself.<br> Why call back the legions...<br> when the garrison of Rome<br> has nothing to do...<br> but to defend us<br> from sausage makers?<br> Let's send Glabrus<br> against these scoundrels!<br> Give 'em a taste of Roman steel.<br> I protest.<br> I most strongly protest.<br> There are more slaves<br> in Rome than Romans.<br> With the garrison absent,<br> what's to prevent them from rising too?<br> I did not say<br> the whole garrison.<br> Six cohorts will<br> more than do the job.<br> The rest can stay in Rome<br> to save you from your housemaids.<br> Will you accept<br> such a charge, Glabrus?<br> I accept the charge<br> of the senate...<br> if the senate truly charges me.<br> The garrison of Rome<br> stands ready.<br> Slave hunting's a dirty business.<br> It takes a brave commander<br> to consent to it.<br> I propose we turn<br> the city out tomorrow...<br> in tribute to Glabrus<br> as he marches through.<br> And...<br> for temporary command<br> of the garrison during his absence...<br> I propose Caius Julius Caesar.<br> You don't look very happy<br> over the new job.<br> It's not a serious disturbance.<br> Glabrus will be back.<br> Maybe.<br> At least it gives me a chance...<br> to separate Glabrus<br> from Crassus for a while.<br> You know, this republic of ours<br> is something like a rich widow.<br> Most Romans love her<br> as their mother.<br> But Crassus dreams of marrying<br> the old girl, to put it politely.<br> Hail Glabrus!<br> Hail Glabrus!<br> - God be with you, Glabrus.<br> - And with you too.<br> I hope he returns<br> to such applause.<br> One fat one, Fimbria!<br> No, keep the change.<br> Give it to your wife.<br> - May the gods adore you.<br> - Only through your prayers.<br> Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifiice<br> for Glabrus' success.<br> I thought you had reservations<br> about the gods.<br> Privately I believe in none of them.<br> Neither do you.<br> Publicly I believe in them all.<br> Greetings, Marcus Clodius Flavius!<br> Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?<br> - He awaits you in the atrium, sir.<br> - Excellent.<br> What have we here?<br> A gift from the governor<br> of Sicily, sir.<br> Antoninus.<br> Sicilian, age 26.<br> Singer of songs.<br> For whom did you practice<br> this wondrous talent?<br> For the children of my master...<br> whom I also taught<br> the classics.<br> Classics, indeed.<br> What position have we, I wonder,<br> for a boy of such varied gifts?<br> You shall be my body servant.<br> Instruct him.<br> All of you, come with me.<br> Are you on guard duty?<br> My dear Crassus,<br> congratulate me.<br> Or better still,<br> let us congratulate each other.<br> I congratulate us.<br> Tomorrow I lead six cohorts<br> of the garrison...<br> against the slaves on Vesuvius.<br> The whole city<br> is turning out to see us off.<br> Great merciful<br> bloodstained gods!<br> Your pardon.<br> I always address heaven<br> in moments of triumph.<br> Did Gracchus have something<br> to do with this brilliant affair?<br> Yes, he even proposed it.<br> Rather decently, too.<br> And you? Do you think I made you<br> commander of the garrison...<br> to control some rock patch<br> on Vesuvius?<br> It was to control<br> the streets of Rome!<br> I only take six cohorts.<br> The rest of the garrison remains.<br> - Under whose command?<br> - Under Caesar's.<br> Excellent, excellent!<br> Finding Gracchus in control<br> of the mob and the senate...<br> you felt compelled to hand over<br> the garrison to him also.<br> I see.<br> I'll refuse. I'll withdraw<br> from the expedition.<br> One of the disadvantages<br> of being a patrician...<br> is that occasionally<br> you're obliged to act like one.<br> You pledged the senate to go,<br> and go you must.<br> If Gracchus should decide<br> to move against you--<br> He won't!<br> Has no need to.<br> He has, with your assistance,<br> immobilized me altogether.<br> Your legions are still in camp<br> outside the city walls?<br> My legions?<br> Do you truly believe I'd order<br> my legions to enter Rome?<br> I only point out that<br> you can if you have to.<br> Are you not aware<br> of Rome's most ancient law...<br> that no general may enter the city<br> at the head of his armed legions?<br> - Sulla did.<br> - Sulla? To the infamy of his name!<br> To the utter damnation<br> of his line!<br> No, my young friend.<br> One day I shall cleanse this Rome<br> which my fathers bequeathed me.<br> I shall restore all the traditions<br> that made her great.<br> It follows, then, that I cannot come<br> to power or even defend myself...<br> by an act which betrays<br> the most sacred tradition of them all.<br> I shall not bring my legions<br> within these walls.<br> I shall not violate Rome...<br> at the moment<br> of possessing her.<br> Go.<br> Prepare your troops<br> at once.<br> March out of Rome tonight,<br> but the city tribute is impossible.<br> We've already been made to look a fool.<br> Let's not add the trappings of a clown.<br> Leave by unfrequented streets,<br> without fanfare, without even a drum!<br> Sneak out.<br> As you wish.<br> And for heaven's sake,<br> my young friend...<br> try and see to it that you don't have<br> to sneak back again.<br> Farewell.<br> Come on, fat boy!<br> Noble Romans...<br> fiighting each other<br> like animals!<br> Your new masters,<br> betting to see who'll die fiirst.<br> Drop your swords.<br> I want to see their blood<br> right over here where Draba died!<br> When I fiight matched pairs,<br> they fiight to the death.<br> I made myself a promise, Crixus.<br> I swore that<br> if I ever got out of this place...<br> I'd die before I'd watch<br> two men fiight to the death again.<br> Draba made that promise too.<br> He kept it.<br> So will l.<br> Go on. Get out!<br> What are we, Crixus?<br> What are we becoming?<br> Romans?<br> Have we learned nothing?<br> What's happening to us?<br> We look for wine<br> when we should be hunting bread.<br> When you've got wine,<br> you don't need bread!<br> You can't just be a gang<br> of drunken raiders.<br> - What else can we be?<br> - Gladiators!<br> An army of gladiators.<br> There's never been<br> an army like that.<br> One gladiator's worth<br> any two Roman soldiers that ever lived.<br> We beat the Roman guards,<br> but a Roman army's a different thing.<br> They fiight different<br> than we do too.<br> We can beat anything they send<br> against us if we really want to.<br> - It takes a big army for that.<br> - We'll have a big army.<br> Once we're on the march...<br> we'll free every slave<br> in every town and village.<br> Can anybody get<br> a bigger army than that?<br> Once we cross the Alps,<br> we're safe!<br> Nobody can cross the Alps. Every pass<br> is defended by its own legion.<br> There's only one way<br> to get out of this country.<br> The sea.<br> What good is the sea<br> if you have no ships?<br> The Cilician pirates have ships.<br> They're at war with Rome.<br> Every Roman galley that sails<br> out of Brundusium pays tribute to them.<br> They've got the biggest fleet<br> in the world.<br> I was a galley slave with them. They'll<br> take you anywhere for enough gold.<br> We haven't got enough gold.<br> Take every Roman we capture<br> and warm his back a little.<br> - We'll have gold, all right.<br> - Spartacus is right!<br> Let's hire these pirates<br> and march straight to Brundusium!<br> Come join us.<br> All of you, come join us.<br> Come on and join us!<br> Back to Vesuvius!<br> Varinia.<br> I thought<br> I'd never see you again.<br> Everything's so different.<br> The last time I saw you...<br> you were waiting<br> in the arena to--<br> I thought<br> you were in Rome.<br> How'd you escape?<br> I jumped out of the cart...<br> and Batiatus was so fat--<br> I flew out of the cart...<br> and Batiatus was so fat...<br> that he couldn't catch me.<br> He couldn't catch up with me.<br> Do you realize...<br> nobody can ever sell you again?<br> Nobody can sell you.<br> - Or give you away.<br> - Or give you away.<br> Nobody can ever make you<br> stay with anybody.<br> Nobody can make you<br> stay with anybody.<br> I love you, Spartacus.<br> I love you.<br> I still can't believe it.<br> Forbid me ever to leave you.<br> I do forbid you.<br> I forbid you.<br> It was funny at the time.<br> I wish he'd heard it.<br> How good you are to me,<br> if I may say so.<br> - You may.<br> - Thank you.<br> Don't just eye those birds.<br> Eat them.<br> There's no need to be<br> on your best behaviour here.<br> May I remind you...<br> you've been very good to me<br> in the past?<br> I've been good to you?<br> Yes. You've sold me slaves<br> at an extremely reasonable price.<br> And you arranged private gladiatorial<br> jousts at cost, or practically.<br> On the whole, you are both<br> ethical in business matters...<br> and certainly farsighted socially.<br> Zenobia's put on a little weight<br> since I last saw her.<br> - Yes, hasn't she? I like it.<br> - So do l.<br> You and I have a tendency<br> towards corpulence.<br> Corpulence makes a man reasonable,<br> pleasant and phlegmatic.<br> Have you noticed the nastiest<br> of tyrants are invariably thin?<br> In spite of your vices, you are<br> the most generous Roman of our time.<br> Vices?<br> The ladies.<br> Ladies!<br> Since when are they a vice?<br> Perhaps I used the wrong word.<br> An eccentricity, a foible.<br> I hope I pronounced that word--<br> It's well-known that even your groom<br> and your butler are women.<br> I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.<br> I keep these women<br> out of my respect for Roman morality.<br> That morality, which has made<br> Rome strong enough to steal...<br> two-thirds of the world<br> from its rightful owners...<br> founded on the sanctity<br> of Roman marriage and family.<br> I happen to like women.<br> I have a promiscuous nature...<br> and, unlike these aristocrats,<br> I will not take a marriage vow...<br> which I know my nature<br> will prevent me from keeping.<br> You have too great a respect<br> for the purity of womankind.<br> Exactly.<br> It must be tantalizing<br> to be surrounded by so much purity.<br> It is.<br> Now, let's mix business with pleasure.<br> How may I help you?<br> Great Gracchus,<br> I fiind it diffiicult to hate...<br> but there's one man I can't think of<br> without fuming.<br> - Who's that?<br> - Crassus.<br> - You've grown ambitious in your hatred.<br> - Do you blame me?<br> There I was, better than<br> a millionaire in the morning...<br> and a penniless refugee<br> by nightfall...<br> with nothing but these rags<br> and my poor flesh to call my own.<br> All because Crassus decides<br> to break his journey at Capua...<br> with a couple of capricious,<br> over-painted nymphs!<br> These two daughters of Venus<br> had to taunt the gladiators...<br> force them to fiight to the death,<br> and before I knew what had happened...<br> revolution on my hands!<br> What revenge have you in mind?<br> I sold Crassus this woman,<br> Varinia.<br> - Whom?<br> - Varinia. May the gods give her wings.<br> There was no contract,<br> but she was clearly his slave...<br> as soon as<br> the deal was made.<br> Now she's off with Spartacus<br> killing people in their beds.<br> And Crassus--<br> no mention of money, no!<br> You never offered me<br> this woman. Why not?<br> Well, she's not remotely<br> your type, Gracchus.<br> - She is very thin and--<br> - Look around you.<br> You'll see women of all sizes.<br> Five hundred sesterces<br> deposit on Varinia.<br> Since he hasn't paid,<br> this gives me fiirst call over Crassus...<br> when she's caught and auctioned.<br> May the gods adore you!<br> Why would you buy a woman<br> you've never even seen?<br> To annoy Crassus, of course,<br> and to help you.<br> Fetch a stool, Antoninus.<br> In here with it.<br> That will do.<br> Do you steal, Antoninus?<br> No, master.<br> Do you lie?<br> Not if I can avoid it.<br> Have you ever<br> dishonoured the gods?<br> No, master.<br> Do you refrain from these vices<br> out of respect for the moral virtues?<br> Yes, master.<br> Do you eat oysters?<br> When I have them, master.<br> Do you eat snails?<br> No, master.<br> Do you consider the eating<br> of oysters to be moral...<br> and the eating of snails<br> to be immoral?<br> No, master.<br> Of course not.<br> It is all a matter<br> of taste, isn't it?<br> Yes, master.<br> And taste is not<br> the same as appetite...<br> and therefore not a question<br> of morals, is it?<br> It could be argued so, master.<br> That will do.<br> My robe, Antoninus.<br> My taste includes...<br> both snails and oysters.<br> Antoninus, look.<br> Across the river.<br> There is something<br> you must see.<br> There, boy, is Rome!<br> The might, the majesty...<br> the terror of Rome.<br> There is the power that bestrides<br> the known world like a colossus.<br> No man can withstand Rome.<br> No nation can withstand her.<br> How much less...<br> a boy!<br> There's only one way to deal<br> with Rome, Antoninus.<br> You must serve her.<br> You must abase yourself<br> before her.<br> You must grovel at her feet.<br> You must...<br> Iove her.<br> Isn't that so, Antoninus?<br> - Take your time!<br> - How are they coming?<br> Good. Give me another thousand like them<br> and we can march on Rome.<br> Come on, once again.<br> Here on Vesuvius,<br> we're safe from attack...<br> while we organize ourselves<br> into an army.<br> It may take six months.<br> It may take a year. We don't know.<br> Once we're strong, we're gonna fiight<br> our way south to the sea.<br> We're going to arrange for ships<br> with the Cilician pirates.<br> Then the sea will be a road<br> back home for all of us.<br> If you agree, you may join us.<br> If you don't agree, go back<br> before your escape is discovered.<br> Too many women.<br> What's wrong with women?<br> Where would you be now,<br> you lout...<br> if some woman hadn't fought<br> all the pains of hell...<br> to get you<br> into this accursed world?<br> I can handle a knife<br> in the dark as well as anyone.<br> I can cast spells<br> and brew poisons.<br> I have made the death shrouds<br> for seven Roman masters in my time.<br> - You lout! I want to see Spartacus.<br> - All right, grandmother.<br> I'm Spartacus. Stay with us.<br> We'll need a million Roman shrouds<br> before we're through.<br> Where do you people come from?<br> Most of us come<br> from the estate of Lillius.<br> - What kind of work did you do there?<br> - Sixteen years a carpenter and mason.<br> Good. We can use carpenters.<br> - What kind of work did you do?<br> - I was a chief steward.<br> You'll help with the food supplies.<br> You'll report to the man Patullus.<br> What kind of work did you do?<br> Singer of songs.<br> Singer of songs?<br> But what work did you do?<br> That's my work.<br> I also juggle.<br> Juggle. What else do you do?<br> I can do feats of magic.<br> Magic?<br> Maybe he can make<br> the Romans disappear.<br> I'll need one volunteer,<br> man or woman. How about you?<br> Here we have a likely subject.<br> You'll notice there is<br> nothing in my hand, true?<br> - How many fiingers do you see?<br> - Three.<br> - How many fiingers do you see?<br> - Three!<br> I make a bowl.<br> My hand is upside down,<br> and I ask you to blow at it.<br> No, not hard enough. Hard!<br> Thank you.<br> Would you like to try?<br> Hit it against the rock, gently.<br> Poet, I haven't had<br> an egg in days.<br> You haven't?<br> - Here.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm not going<br> to let mine get away.<br> - Sing us a song.<br> - Sing us a song, Antoninus.<br> Sing, Antoninus.<br> When the blazing sun<br> hangs low in the western sky...<br> when the wind dies away<br> on the mountain...<br> when the song<br> of the meadowlark turns still...<br> when the fiield locust clicks<br> no more in the fiield...<br> and the sea foam sleeps<br> like a maiden at rest...<br> and twilight touches the shape<br> of the wandering earth...<br> I turn home.<br> Through blue shadows<br> and purple woods...<br> I turn home.<br> I turn to the place<br> that I was born...<br> to the mother who bore me<br> and the father who taught me...<br> Iong ago. Iong ago...<br> Iong ago.<br> Alone am I now. Iost and alone.<br> in a far. wide. wandering world.<br> Yet still when<br> the blazing sun hangs low...<br> when the wind dies away<br> and the sea foam sleeps...<br> and twilight touches<br> the wandering earth...<br> I turn home.<br> Where'd you learn that song?<br> My father taught it to me.<br> I was wrong about you, poet.<br> You won't learn to kill.<br> You'll teach us songs.<br> I came here to fiight.<br> Anyone can learn to fiight.<br> I joined to fiight!<br> - What's your name?<br> - Antoninus.<br> There's a time for fiighting,<br> and there's a time for singing.<br> Now you teach us to sing.<br> Sing, Antoninus.<br> When the blazing sun<br> hangs low in the western sky--<br> You like him, don't you?<br> Who wants to fiight?<br> An animal can learn to fiight.<br> But to sing beautiful things...<br> and make people believe them--<br> What are you thinking about?<br> I'm free.<br> And what do I know?<br> I don't even know<br> how to read.<br> You know things<br> that can't be taught.<br> I know nothing.<br> Nothing!<br> And I want to know.<br> I want to--<br> I want to know.<br> Know what?<br> Everything.<br> Why a star falls<br> and a bird doesn't.<br> Where the sun goes at night.<br> Why the moon changes shape.<br> I want to know<br> where the wind comes from.<br> The wind begins in a cave.<br> Far to the north,<br> a young god sleeps in that cave.<br> He dreams of a girl...<br> and he sighs...<br> and the night wind<br> stirs with his breath.<br> I want to know all about you.<br> Every line...<br> every curve.<br> I want to know<br> every part of you.<br> Every beat of your heart.<br> Go on about the city<br> of Metapontum.<br> What garrisons<br> will we fiind there?<br> There are two legions in the garrison.<br> Some have been sent south--<br> Set the litter down there.<br> Where is this slave general?<br> Dionysius, get the litter bearers<br> out of the rain.<br> Give them food, bread,<br> and their freedom.<br> - All right, follow me.<br> - We'll pay you for them.<br> We have no slaves<br> in this camp.<br> Tigranes Levantus at your service.<br> My credentials.<br> Come in.<br> "To the general of the ltalian slaves<br> called Spartacus...<br> from lbar M'hali, Cilician governor<br> of the island of Delos."<br> - Sit down.<br> - "Greetings.<br> Word has been received that you wish<br> to embark your armies...<br> on the Cilician ships<br> from the ltalian port of Brundusium.<br> - Receive now my agent, Tigranes--"<br> - Levantus.<br> "who bargains in my name.<br> May lsis and Serapis bring victory<br> to your cause. The governor of Delos."<br> - Who are lsis and Serapis?<br> - Gods of the east.<br> Why should they want us to win?<br> Because they favour Cilicia...<br> and Cilicia, like you,<br> fiights against the Romans.<br> Would you like some wine?<br> I drink only after the bargain<br> has been concluded...<br> never before.<br> How many ships<br> do these Cilicians have?<br> Five hundred at least.<br> But no deal is too small,<br> I assure you.<br> We'll need them all.<br> - All?<br> - What is the price?<br> Price is 100,000 sesterces<br> per ship.<br> For 500 ships that would be...<br> - You have such a sum?<br> - We will have.<br> See for yourself.<br> - Beautiful.<br> - When will the ships be ready?<br> Beautiful.<br> I love to see such beauty.<br> When will the ships be ready?<br> My friend...<br> when will you be ready?<br> How long will it take you...<br> to cross one-third<br> the length of ltaly...<br> fiighting a major battle<br> in every town?<br> One year? Two years?<br> If we're not in Brundusium<br> seven months from now...<br> we'll never be there.<br> What if we assemble the ships...<br> and there is no longer<br> a slave army to board them?<br> We'll give you a chest of treasure now,<br> the rest when we get to Brundusium.<br> - This one?<br> - Yes.<br> Done! Seven months from now,<br> the ships will be assembled.<br> Arrange to have the chest loaded.<br> Now, with your permission, I should<br> like to have the wine you offered me.<br> - Will you join me?<br> - I will.<br> Excellent workmanship.<br> It came from the estate<br> of a wealthy nobleman.<br> I've heard that you are<br> of noble birth yourself.<br> I'm the son<br> and grandson of slaves.<br> I knew that<br> when I saw you couldn't read.<br> Of course, it pleases Roman vanity<br> to think that you are noble.<br> They shrink from the idea<br> of fiighting mere slaves...<br> especially a man like Crassus.<br> - You know him?<br> - I entertained him one afternoon.<br> - You?<br> - In the arena.<br> Excellent wine.<br> - May I ask you something?<br> - You can ask.<br> Surely you know<br> you're going to lose, don't you?<br> You have no chance.<br> At this very moment, six cohorts<br> of the garrison of Rome...<br> are approaching this position.<br> What are you going to do?<br> We'll decide that<br> when they get here.<br> Let me put it differently.<br> If you looked<br> into a magic crystal...<br> and you saw your army destroyed<br> and yourself dead...<br> if you saw that in the future...<br> as I'm sure<br> you're seeing it now...<br> would you continue to fiight?<br> - Yes.<br> - Knowing that you must lose?<br> Knowing we can.<br> All men lose when they die<br> and all men die.<br> But a slave and a free man<br> lose different things.<br> They both lose life.<br> When a free man dies,<br> he loses the pleasure of life.<br> A slave loses his pain.<br> Death is the only freedom<br> a slave knows.<br> That's why he's not afraid of it.<br> That's why we'll win.<br> Spartacus,<br> that pirate was right.<br> The garrison of Rome,<br> they're setting up camp.<br> - How many are there?<br> - About six cohorts.<br> - Where?<br> - At the mouth of the valley...<br> against the cliffs.<br> - Strong camp?<br> - They have no stockade.<br> No stockade? Are you sure?<br> - I'm very sure.<br> - This campaign is great sport for them.<br> The Romans are having a picnic.<br> - Did they see you?<br> - No! We were hidden.<br> Maybe we ought to join<br> this Roman picnic.<br> Form your men.<br> Six cohorts.<br> A lot of arms and weapons...<br> to build our army with.<br> Crixus always wanted<br> to march on Rome.<br> Now he doesn't have to.<br> Rome's come to us.<br> Half this way!<br> The rest over there.<br> Stand up, the way<br> a noble Roman should!<br> That's Roman pride for you!<br> That's better.<br> What's your name?<br> Marcus Glabrus.<br> Commander of the garrison<br> of Rome!<br> Commander?<br> He was commanding it on his belly<br> when we found him, playing dead!<br> You disappoint me,<br> Marcus Glabrus.<br> Playing dead.<br> You afraid to die?<br> It's easy to die.<br> Haven't you seen<br> enough gladiators in the arena...<br> to see how easy it is to die?<br> Of course you have.<br> What are you going<br> to do to me?<br> I don't know.<br> - What should we do with him?<br> - Let's have a matched pair, him and me.<br> I'll not fiight like a gladiator!<br> You keep staring at this.<br> Do you recognize this baton?<br> - Yes!<br> - You should! It was in your tent.<br> The symbol of the senate.<br> All the power of Rome!<br> That's the power of Rome!<br> Take that back to your senate.<br> Tell them you and that broken stick is<br> all that's left of the garrison of Rome!<br> Tell them we want nothing<br> from Rome.<br> Nothing except our freedom!<br> All we want is to get out<br> of this damn country!<br> We're marching south<br> to the sea.<br> And we'll smash every army<br> they send against us.<br> Put him on a horse!<br> Their leader said<br> their hatred of Rome was such...<br> that all they wished<br> was to escape from her rule.<br> If unopposed, he promised<br> a peaceful march to the sea.<br> If opposed, he threatens<br> to ravage the countryside...<br> and destroy every legion<br> sent against him.<br> And once they get to the sea?<br> They plan to take ship with Cilician<br> pirates and return to their homes.<br> From which port do they<br> propose to embark?<br> I don't know.<br> But city garrisons<br> can't stand up to them.<br> If they are to be intercepted,<br> it's work for the legions!<br> What sort of a man is<br> this leader of the slaves?<br> I don't know.<br> I think they called him<br> Spartacus.<br> Is that name familiar to you?<br> Yes, it does seem to be.<br> I can't place it.<br> After he talked to you,<br> what happened then?<br> I was tied to a horse<br> and lashed out of camp.<br> How many of your company<br> escaped?<br> Fourteen have reported<br> thus far.<br> I myself was taken prisoner<br> in my own command tent.<br> The camp was thoroughly infiiltrated<br> before an alarm could be sounded.<br> Did you surround your camp<br> with moat and stockade?<br> No.<br> We arrived after sunset.<br> Sentries were posted every ten paces.<br> There was no reason to expect<br> an attack by night.<br> Then again, well, they--<br> Continue.<br> They were only slaves.<br> I see.<br> I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus<br> has disgraced the arms of Rome.<br> Let the punishment<br> of the senate be pronounced.<br> If we punished every commander<br> who made a fool of himself...<br> we wouldn't have anyone left<br> above the rank of centurion.<br> But this is a case<br> of criminal carelessness!<br> Six cohorts have been slaughtered.<br> Crassus sponsored this young man.<br> Let him pronounce sentence.<br> The punishment is well-known!<br> Let Publius Marcus Glabrus<br> be denied...<br> fiire, water,<br> food and shelter...<br> for a distance of 400 miles<br> in all directions from the city of Rome.<br> One thing more.<br> Glabrus is my friend, and I will not<br> dissociate myself from his disgrace.<br> I now lay down the command<br> of my legions...<br> and retire to private life.<br> Good-bye, Crassus.<br> This is no time for a man of honour<br> to withdraw from public affairs!<br> - Shame, shame!<br> - Sit down.<br> This sort of heroic<br> public behaviour is nothing new!<br> I've seen it before-- we all have--<br> and I know the meaning of it!<br> - Crassus acted on a point of honour!<br> - Patrician honour!<br> No matter how noble<br> this looks from the outside...<br> I don't like the colour of it.<br> Crassus is<br> the only man in Rome...<br> who hasn't yielded to<br> republican corruption, and never will!<br> I'll take some republican corruption<br> along with some republican freedom...<br> but I won't take...<br> the dictatorship of Crassus<br> and no freedom at all!<br> That's what he's out for...<br> and that's why he'll be back.<br> To the mother that bore me...<br> to the father that taught me...<br> to the god--<br> To the blue woods<br> and the purple shadows, l--<br> To blue shadows<br> and purple woods.<br> - Spartacus, you frightened me!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - How long have you been there?<br> - A little while.<br> Why didn't you say something?<br> You seemed so happy.<br> I didn't want to bother you.<br> I am happy.<br> Spartacus, I've been trying to remember<br> the song that Antoninus sang.<br> Is it blue shadows<br> and purple woods?<br> Or is it purple woods<br> and blue shadows, or what is it?<br> I want to make love<br> to my wife!<br> Spartacus, put me down. I'm--<br> I don't care.<br> - You've got, you've--<br> - Yes?<br> - You have to be gentle with me.<br> - Why?<br> Why, darling?<br> I'm going to have a baby.<br> Now put me down.<br> What?<br> A baby.<br> A baby? When?<br> In the spring.<br> - How? I mean, how do you know?<br> - I know.<br> A baby in the spring.<br> - I'm gonna have a son.<br> - But it might be a daughter.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> - I just did.<br> You're cold.<br> Here, get underneath this.<br> - Did I hurt you?<br> - No, you didn't.<br> - I didn't mean to be so rough.<br> - Why don't you kiss me?<br> This is the fiirst time<br> I was ever going to have a baby.<br> A baby.<br> I'm just the same<br> as I ever was, Spartacus.<br> I won't break.<br> These slaves have already cost us<br> a thousand million sesterces.<br> If now they want to relieve us<br> of their unwelcome presence...<br> in the name of all the gods,<br> let them go!<br> Impossible! They've already infected<br> half of ltaly with this uprising.<br> If we permit them<br> to escape now...<br> this condition will spread<br> throughout the entire empire.<br> The Republic...<br> is still weak<br> from 20 years of civil strife.<br> We're engaged in two wars:<br> one in Spain<br> and the other in Asia.<br> Pirates have cut off<br> our Egyptian grain supply...<br> and Spartacus raids the commerce<br> of all south ltaly.<br> Half the precincts of Rome<br> are without bread!<br> The city is close to panic.<br> There are two things<br> we must do immediately!<br> Confiirm Caesar as permanent<br> commander of the garrison...<br> and assign two legions...<br> to intercept and destroy Spartacus<br> at the city of Metapontum!<br> If we could only have had<br> Batiatus in the other pot!<br> - Now you're talking!<br> - Varinia, wonderful meal.<br> A small piece of land<br> with a few goats on it.<br> The best wine in the world.<br> For wine you've got to go to Aquitania.<br> The sweetest grapes on earth.<br> Come to Lidya for wine.<br> That's the best.<br> The best wine comes from Greece.<br> Everybody knows that. Even the Romans!<br> No, Lidya!<br> You're all wrong!<br> The best wine comes from home,<br> wherever it is.<br> I agree with you.<br> Gentlemen.<br> - Are there reports on Metapontum?<br> - Heralds are crying the news now.<br> We lost 19,000 men,<br> including Commodius and his offiicers.<br> Nineteen thousand?<br> Have you estates in Metapontum?<br> No. A son with Commodius.<br> With your permission, good day.<br> We take fiive years<br> to train a legion.<br> How can this Spartacus<br> train an army in seven months?<br> There's something wrong,<br> something very wrong.<br> - We should have an investigation.<br> - By all means, an investigation.<br> -Where is Spartacus now?<br> -He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.<br> I need a few moments<br> of the commander's time.<br> Will you excuse us?<br> I hear you've taken a house<br> in the fourth ward.<br> Not a very splendid house either.<br> And you feasted 11,000 plebeians<br> in the fiield of Mars.<br> It scarcely could've<br> been called a feast.<br> For 200 years, your family<br> and mine have been members...<br> of the Equestrian Order<br> and the Patrician Party.<br> Servants and rulers of Rome.<br> Why have you left us<br> for Gracchus and the mob?<br> I've left no one,<br> least of all Rome.<br> But this much I've learned<br> from Gracchus: Rome is the mob.<br> No!<br> Rome is an eternal thought<br> in the mind of God.<br> I had no idea<br> you'd grown religious.<br> That doesn't matter.<br> If there were no gods at all,<br> I'd revere them.<br> If there were no Rome,<br> I'd dream of her...<br> as I want you to do.<br> I want you to come back<br> to your own kind.<br> I beg you to.<br> Is it me you want<br> or is it the garrison?<br> Both. Tell me frankly.<br> If you were l, would you<br> take the fiield against Spartacus?<br> - Of course.<br> - Why?<br> We have no other choice<br> if we're to save Rome.<br> Caesar!<br> Which Rome?<br> Theirs...<br> or ours?<br> You know Gracchus<br> is my friend.<br> I won't betray him.<br> Caesar.<br> Which is worse: to betray a friend<br> or to betray Rome herself?<br> My dear Crassus,<br> I face no such choice.<br> You will,<br> sooner than you think.<br> Good afternoon, Crassus.<br> I've been looking for you all day.<br> Your new master.<br> The senate's been in session all day<br> over this business of Spartacus.<br> We've got eight legions to march<br> against him and no one to lead them.<br> The minute you offer<br> the generals command...<br> they start wheezing<br> like winded mules.<br> I've seen such epidemics before,<br> haven't you?<br> - How's your health?<br> - Excellent, as you know.<br> I take it the senate's now offering<br> command of the legions to me.<br> - You've been expecting it.<br> - I have.<br> But have you thought how costly<br> my services might be?<br> We buy everything else<br> these days.<br> No reason why we shouldn't be charged<br> for patriotism. What's your fee?<br> My election as fiirst consul,<br> command of all the legions of ltaly...<br> and the abolition of senatorial<br> authority over the courts.<br> Dictatorship.<br> Order.<br> - Advise me if my terms are acceptable.<br> - I can tell you now.<br> - They're unacceptable.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> For the present perhaps, but times<br> change, and so does the senate.<br> When that day comes,<br> I shall be ready.<br> - Convey my respects to your wife.<br> - With pleasure.<br> He's right, you know.<br> If something isn't done about Spartacus,<br> the senate will change.<br> And Crassus will move in<br> and save Rome from the slave army...<br> by assuming dictatorship.<br> But that, like everything else,<br> depends on which way Spartacus jumps.<br> Just now, he's trying<br> to get out of ltaly.<br> If he succeeds,<br> the crisis is over...<br> and Crassus may stay<br> in retirement indefiinitely.<br> I've arranged for Spartacus<br> to escape from ltaly.<br> You've done what?<br> I've made a little deal<br> with the Cilician pirates.<br> I've assured them<br> that we won't interfere...<br> if they transport Spartacus<br> and his slaves out of ltaly.<br> So now we deal with pirates.<br> We bargain with criminals!<br> Don't you be so stiff-necked about it.<br> Politics is a practical profession.<br> If a criminal has what you want,<br> you do business with him.<br> How far are we from Brundusium?<br> About 20 miles.<br> Our army will have to camp here tonight.<br> They're still about six hours behind us.<br> Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.<br> Bring Tigranes here.<br> Marco, report back to Spartacus.<br> Tell him we camp tonight<br> by the sea!<br> If all goes well, my estimate is<br> we can load 150 ships a day.<br> That's your job, Dionysius.<br> Work with the Cilician pirates.<br> - That oughta keep him busy.<br> - Saves me fiinding someplace to sleep.<br> Crixus, keep giving me reports<br> on Pompey.<br> There won't be any surprises.<br> I still want patrols of<br> the back country until we board ship.<br> I'll get them together now.<br> Spartacus, the harbour district<br> in Brundusium has food warehouses...<br> but not enough to provide<br> for the whole fleet.<br> The countryside's fiilled with cattle.<br> And we've more than enough salt<br> to preserve them.<br> I'll handle it.<br> Find out how many men we have in camp<br> who were galley slaves or sailors.<br> Tigranes Levantus.<br> - My dear general.<br> - Welcome, Tigranes!<br> No, no. You needn't look<br> for litter bearers to emancipate.<br> I rode a horse.<br> Your gods lsis and Serapis<br> must've been good to us.<br> The balance of the 50 million sesterces<br> we owe you.<br> General...<br> I bear a heavy burden<br> of evil tidings.<br> What is it?<br> Pompey and his army<br> has landed in ltaly.<br> At the border of Rhegium<br> three days ago.<br> We get complete reports<br> on their movements.<br> But do you also know...<br> that a Roman fleet carrying<br> Lucullus and his army...<br> arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?<br> - Lucullus here?<br> - You have no ships.<br> I saw them in the harbour.<br> The Cilician fleet,<br> out of strategic necessity...<br> has been obliged to withdraw.<br> - Withdraw?<br> - There are no ships at all?<br> Cilician pirates can destroy<br> any Roman fleet that ever sailed.<br> If they run away now,<br> it's not because they're afraid!<br> You better give me<br> a better reason.<br> I'm as desolated<br> as you are, General.<br> Stand up. Up!<br> On your toes.<br> - You'll cut the skin.<br> - Why did the Cilicians run away?<br> They were paid.<br> And who paid them?<br> Who?<br> Crassus.<br> Crassus won't fiight us himself.<br> The reports say he won't take<br> the command of an army.<br> Why would he bribe your pirates<br> to keep us from escaping?<br> I don't know. How can I answer<br> when there is no answer?<br> I've been betrayed,<br> just as you have!<br> There is an answer.<br> There must be an answer<br> to everything.<br> We're fiive miles<br> from Brundusium.<br> Here's Rhegium.<br> Pompey's march must have<br> brought him to about here.<br> He's four days away,<br> maybe more.<br> Lucullus lands<br> at Brundusium tomorrow.<br> If we engage Lucullus...<br> Pompey will have enough time<br> to march against our rear.<br> If we turn west<br> to meet Pompey...<br> Lucullus will march<br> against our rear.<br> The only other army<br> in all of ltaly is here!<br> Rome.<br> Yes, of course!<br> Crassus is inviting us<br> to march on Rome...<br> so he can take the fiield<br> against us.<br> You mean Crassus wants us<br> to march on Rome?<br> He's forcing us to. He knows<br> I won't let myself be trapped...<br> between two armies<br> with my back to the sea.<br> He knows my only other choice<br> is Rome.<br> Somewhere on the way,<br> we meet.<br> If he beats us,<br> he becomes the saviour of Rome...<br> and there's his fiinal victory<br> over the senate.<br> General, allow me<br> to redeem myself in your eyes.<br> For a very small commission...<br> I can arrange for you, your family<br> and your leaders, of course...<br> to be smuggled out of ltaly and<br> transported to an eastern country...<br> where men of substance like you<br> are welcome and appreciated.<br> You can live there like kings<br> for the rest of your lives.<br> What do you think, General?<br> Go away.<br> Go away?<br> Tell the trumpeters<br> to sound assembly.<br> Tonight a Roman army lands<br> in the harbour of Brundusium.<br> Another army is approaching<br> us from the west.<br> Between them,<br> they hope to trap us here...<br> against the sea.<br> The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.<br> We have no ships.<br> "By order of the senate...<br> be it known that we have<br> this day elected...<br> Marcus Licinius Crassus...<br> fiirst consul of the Republic...<br> and commander in chief<br> of the armies of Rome."<br> Hail Crassus!<br> Rome will not allow us<br> to escape from ltaly.<br> We have no choice<br> but to march against Rome herself...<br> and end this war the only way<br> it could have ended:<br> by freeing every slave in ltaly.<br> I promise you...<br> a new Rome...<br> a new ltaly<br> and a new empire.<br> I promise the destruction<br> of the slave army...<br> and the restoration of order...<br> throughout all our territories.<br> I'd rather be here,<br> a free man among brothers...<br> facing a long march<br> and a hard fiight...<br> than to be the richest citizen<br> of Rome...<br> fat with food<br> he didn't work for...<br> and surrounded by slaves.<br> I promise the living body<br> of Spartacus...<br> for whatever punishment<br> you may deem fiit.<br> That or his head.<br> This I vow by the spirits<br> of all my forefathers.<br> This I have sworn...<br> in the temple<br> that guards their bones.<br> Hail Crassus!<br> We've travelled<br> a long ways together.<br> We've fought many battles<br> and won great victories.<br> Now, instead of taking ship<br> for our homes across the sea...<br> we must fiight again.<br> Maybe there's no peace<br> in this world...<br> for us or for anyone else.<br> I don't know.<br> But I do know...<br> that as long as we live...<br> we must stay true to ourselves.<br> I do know that we're brothers,<br> and I know that we're free.<br> We march tonight!<br> Hail Crassus!<br> Greetings to you, Crassus.<br> Caius. Gentlemen.<br> Have your dispositions<br> been made?<br> Each maniple knows its position in line,<br> sir, and exactly what's expected.<br> Every legion commander<br> has been given his battle orders.<br> Excellent. All positions<br> will now be changed.<br> Changed?<br> Spartacus takes too keen<br> an interest in our plans, I fear.<br> New battle orders<br> will be issued in a short while.<br> Spartacus has every reason to believe<br> that he has outdistanced...<br> the pursuing armies<br> of Pompey and of Lucullus.<br> However, there are passes<br> through the Apennine Mountains...<br> unknown to any map.<br> It may fortify<br> your courage to know...<br> that Pompey is at this moment encamped<br> some 20 miles to the west of us...<br> and that the army of Lucullus<br> approaches from the south...<br> by forced night march.<br> Sir, allow us to pledge you the most<br> glorious victory of your career.<br> I'm not after glory!<br> I'm after Spartacus.<br> And, gentlemen,<br> I mean to have him.<br> However, this campaign<br> is not alone to kill Spartacus.<br> It is to kill<br> the legend of Spartacus.<br> You may go, gentlemen.<br> Hail Crassus.<br> Lentulus Batiatus<br> awaits Your Excellency.<br> - Who?<br> - The lanista, sir.<br> Admit him.<br> Most Blessed Highness,<br> as soon as I received your message...<br> I hurried into your<br> distinguished presence.<br> I'm glad you were able<br> to spare the time. Sit down.<br> How gracious.<br> I understand--<br> I'm informed--<br> that Spartacus once trained<br> under your auspices.<br> Yes! ln fact...<br> if it isn't too subversive<br> to say so...<br> I made him<br> what he is today.<br> You're to be congratulated<br> indeed.<br> I, too, as it happens, since you're<br> so admirably qualifiied to give me...<br> what up to now<br> I've not been able to obtain:<br> a physical description<br> of Spartacus.<br> Yes.<br> But you saw him.<br> - What?<br> - In the ring.<br> When?<br> When you visited my school<br> with those two charming ladies.<br> What?<br> I trust they're both<br> in good health.<br> They selected him to fiight<br> against Draba, the Negro.<br> - I remember the Negro.<br> - You had good cause to, if I remember--<br> If I may say so, Your Excellency.<br> A brilliant dagger thrust.<br> Diffiicult angle.<br> - Spartacus was the opponent?<br> - Yes.<br> What did he look like?<br> That's a matter of some<br> importance to Your Highness?<br> Yes, to every man who loves Rome<br> and wishes to see her strong.<br> We're both Roman patriots, sir.<br> You're a great one.<br> I, of course, smaller.<br> But we both believe<br> in Roman fair play.<br> If you want<br> something from me...<br> I would be lacking<br> in respect for my own conscience...<br> if I did not say<br> that I wish something from you.<br> Name your price.<br> If-- no--<br> when you win<br> your victory tomorrow...<br> presumably the survivors<br> will be auctioned off...<br> in order to pay for the expenses<br> of this heroic expedition.<br> Could not the agent<br> for that sale be he...<br> who shares this tiny moment<br> of history with Your Honour?<br> I authorize you to be the agent<br> for the sale of all survivors.<br> In return, you will remain here with us<br> until after the battle...<br> and aid me<br> in identifying Spartacus.<br> After the battle?<br> You misunderstand me.<br> I'm a civilian.<br> I'm even more of a civilian<br> than most civilians.<br> If you wish to remain so...<br> I should strongly advise you<br> to stay here and be our guest.<br> Guard!<br> My dear, all-conquering<br> Marcus Licinius Crassus...<br> what if it is Spartacus<br> who crosses the battlefiield...<br> Iooking for you?<br> In such circumstances,<br> I have no doubt...<br> you will be helping him.<br> This fellow remains with us<br> until after the battle.<br> Make him comfortable.<br> Don't let him feel lonely.<br> Mommy? Mommy?<br> When do we go home?<br> Go to sleep, dear.<br> No pains yet?<br> He's a bad child, though.<br> He hits me with his fiist.<br> He wants to see his mother.<br> Can you blame him?<br> Can you feel it?<br> No, I don't.<br> I hope he waits<br> till we get to Rome.<br> Rome!<br> They've never beaten us yet.<br> No.<br> But no matter how many times<br> we beat them...<br> they still seem to have<br> another army to send against us.<br> And another.<br> Varinia, it just seems<br> like we've started something...<br> that has no ending!<br> If it ended tomorrow,<br> it would be worth it.<br> Varinia, don't make me weak.<br> You're strong enough<br> to be weak.<br> I love you more than my life.<br> Yet, sometimes, even with you here<br> sleeping beside me...<br> I feel so alone.<br> I imagine a god for slaves...<br> and I pray.<br> What do you pray for?<br> I pray for a son<br> who'll be born free.<br> I pray for the same thing.<br> Take care of my son, Varinia.<br> If he never knows me...<br> tell him who I was<br> and what we dreamed of.<br> Tell him the truth. There will be<br> plenty of others to tell him lies.<br> I can't live without you,<br> Spartacus!<br> For you and me<br> there can be no farewells.<br> As long as one of us lives...<br> we all live.<br> I felt it! Did you feel it?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - That was so strong. Does it hurt you?<br> That was so strong.<br> Lucullus and Pompey.<br> Have we a count of prisoners?<br> We haven't made<br> the fiinal count, sir.<br> I bring a message<br> from your master...<br> Marcus Licinius Crassus...<br> commander of ltaly.<br> By command of<br> His Most Merciful Excellency...<br> your lives are to be spared.<br> Slaves you were...<br> and slaves you remain.<br> But the terrible penalty<br> of crucifiixion...<br> has been set aside...<br> on the single condition<br> that you identify the body...<br> or the living person<br> of the slave called Spartacus.<br> - I'm Spartacus!<br> - I'm Spartacus!<br> Forgive me for being one of the last<br> to congratulate you, Your Nobility.<br> There's an ugly rumour<br> going round the camp...<br> that the prisoners<br> are to be crucifiied.<br> That is true.<br> Perhaps this is the moment<br> to remind Your Highness...<br> that yesterday you promised me I could<br> be the agent in their auctioning.<br> Last night you promised<br> Spartacus to me! Where is he?<br> In return, I promised you<br> the sale of the survivors...<br> and there will be none!<br> - It's Varinia.<br> - Yes, I remember.<br> You're the woman of Spartacus?<br> I'm his wife.<br> And this is his child?<br> Yes.<br> Where is Spartacus?<br> Dead.<br> Did you see him killed?<br> Yes.<br> You're lying. Where is he?<br> At least here is someone<br> worth selling, Your Enormity.<br> I'll even take the child<br> as an investment.<br> - How many women have been taken?<br> - Under forty, sir.<br> Most of those who weren't killed have<br> run to the hills with their children.<br> You may sell all the others,<br> but not this woman.<br> But you haven't seen<br> the others, Your Magnitude.<br> They're of surpassing ugliness!<br> A genius wouldn't be able to sell them!<br> Flog that scoundrel out of camp.<br> This woman and her child<br> are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.<br> - Halt them!<br> - Halt!<br> Antoninus?<br> Tribune!<br> Slaves are to be crucifiied<br> along the roadside...<br> the whole distance between here<br> and the gates of Rome.<br> Hold this man till the end.<br> And that man too.<br> - March on.<br> - March on!<br> I've more stripes on my back<br> than a zebra!<br> Every time I touch my wounds...<br> they sing like larks.<br> But in spite of that,<br> I think I've found something...<br> - I never had before with all my wealth.<br> - What is that?<br> Don't laugh at me,<br> but I believe it to be dignity.<br> In Rome,<br> dignity shortens life...<br> even more surely than disease.<br> The gods must be saving you<br> for some great enterprise.<br> You think so?<br> Anyone who believes I'll turn informer<br> for nothing is a fool.<br> I bore the whip<br> without complaint.<br> Yes, indeed, that sounds<br> like a bad attack of dignity.<br> I hope, however,<br> this will not deflect you...<br> from the revenge<br> you were going to take on Crassus.<br> No, on the contrary.<br> It only strengthens my resolve.<br> I'm glad to learn that.<br> This woman Varinia is in his house.<br> All Rome knows about it.<br> Malicious tongues even say...<br> that he's in love<br> for the fiirst time in his life.<br> I noticed a strange look in his eye<br> when he fiirst saw her.<br> It would take a great woman...<br> to make Crassus<br> fall out of love with himself.<br> I'll be honest with you,<br> Gracchus.<br> She's not as unattractive<br> as I told you she was.<br> Dignity and honesty in one afternoon!<br> I hardly recognize you.<br> - But she is an impossible woman.<br> - Beautiful?<br> Beautiful? Well, beautiful.<br> The more chains you put on her,<br> the less like a slave she looks.<br> - Proud?<br> - Proud, proud.<br> You'd feel that she would surrender<br> to the right man...<br> which is irritating.<br> I like Crassus.<br> Let's save him from his agony.<br> Let's steal this woman.<br> Steal the woman? Why?<br> I can no longer hurt Crassus<br> in the senate...<br> but I can hurt him where<br> he'll feel it most: in his pride.<br> Attack our enemy from within.<br> The scheme is excellent...<br> but I hope you're not suggesting<br> that I steal the woman!<br> Yes.<br> Buy some horses<br> and a cart with a canopy.<br> Bring her here by nightfall.<br> Add courage<br> to your newfound virtues.<br> Would half a million sesterces<br> make you brave?<br> Half a million?<br> Crassus does seem to dwindle<br> in the mind, but--<br> Let's reduce him still further.<br> A round million!<br> A million.<br> For such a sum,<br> I could bribe Jupiter himself!<br> With a lesser sum, I have.<br> Forgive the intrusion.<br> You know I'm not in the habit<br> of coming into your house uninvited.<br> You've always been welcome here...<br> as a pupil.<br> - You're not alone.<br> - No.<br> This time you've come to teach.<br> You've joined Crassus?<br> - Am I arrested?<br> - No.<br> But I must ask you to come with me<br> to the senate immediately.<br> What I do,<br> I do not for myself...<br> but for Rome.<br> Poor helpless Rome!<br> Let's go and hear more<br> about Rome from Crassus!<br> Did you truly believe<br> could so easily be delivered<br> into the clutches of a mob?<br> Already the bodies<br> of 6,000 crucifiied slaves...<br> Iine the Appian Way.<br> Tomorrow the last of their companions<br> will fiight to the death...<br> in the temple of my fathers<br> as a sacrifiice to them.<br> As those slaves have died,<br> so will your rabble...<br> if they falter one instant<br> in loyalty to the new order of affairs.<br> The enemies of the state<br> are known.<br> Arrests are in progress.<br> The prisons begin to fiill.<br> In every city and province, lists<br> of the disloyal have been compiled.<br> Tomorrow they will learn<br> the cost of their terrible folly...<br> their treason.<br> Where does my name appear...<br> on the list of disloyal enemies<br> of the state?<br> First.<br> Yet upon you I have<br> no desire for vengeance.<br> Your property<br> shall not be touched.<br> You will retain the rank<br> and title of Roman senator.<br> A house...<br> a farmhouse in Picenum<br> has been provided for your exile.<br> You may take your women<br> with you.<br> Why am I to be left<br> so conspicuously alive?<br> Your followers are<br> deluded enough to trust you.<br> I intend that you shall speak to them<br> tomorrow for their own good...<br> their peaceful<br> and profiitable future.<br> From time to time thereafter,<br> I may fiind it useful...<br> to bring you back to Rome<br> to continue your duty to her...<br> to calm the envious spirit...<br> and the troubled mind.<br> You will persuade them<br> to accept destiny and order...<br> and trust the gods!<br> You may go.<br> Halt!<br> Now, why hide<br> behind that stola?<br> That's better.<br> That dress took some weeks<br> of a woman's life.<br> You, above all people, should respect<br> the work of slaves and wear it proudly.<br> Come here.<br> This belonged to a queen...<br> the queen of Persia.<br> It's heavy.<br> In time you will wear it<br> lightly enough.<br> Sit down.<br> Will you have<br> some squab and honey?<br> No.<br> You'll enjoy it.<br> And a piece of melon?<br> And some wine, of course.<br> Eat.<br> I did not command you to eat.<br> I invited you.<br> You fiind the richness<br> of your surroundings...<br> makes conversation diffiicult?<br> Why am I here?<br> Good question.<br> A woman's question.<br> I wish the answer could be<br> as good and straightforward.<br> -
