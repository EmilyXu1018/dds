                        Miss Carmichael, please.<br> Dr. Petersen is ready for you.<br> I'm awfully sorry. I have to go.<br> Had a perfect hand.<br> Would've beaten the pants off you.<br> - Harry will take you, Miss Carmichael.<br> - Thank you.<br> Watch her carefully.<br> Don't take your eyes off her.<br> - How are you today, Harry?<br> - Fine.<br> - You look a little bilious.<br> - It's the light.<br> I worry about you, dear.<br> I'll be all right.<br> Must we dash into Dr. Petersen's office?<br> Can't we go sit somewhere in private<br> and talk, just you and I?<br> Love it, if I had time.<br> Would you?<br> Come in.<br> You ruined a very interesting card game,<br> Dr. Petersen.<br> - You may go now, Harry.<br> - I'll be outside.<br> I hope you feel better today, Mary.<br> - Well, I don't.<br> - You will.<br> I think this whole thing is ridiculous.<br> What whole thing, Mary?<br> Psychoanalysis. It bores the pants off of me.<br> Lying on the couch<br> like some dreary nitwit, telling all.<br> You don't really expect to get anywhere<br> listening to me babble<br> about my idiotic childhood.<br> Really.<br> My patients invariably regard me<br> as a wretched nuisance<br> during our first talks.<br> I see. It's my subconscious<br> putting up a fight.<br> It doesn't want me cured.<br> Exactly. It wants to continue<br> enjoying your disease.<br> Our job is to make you understand why.<br> When you know why you're doing something<br> that's bad for you<br> and when you first started doing it.<br> Then you can begin curing yourself.<br> You mean I've been telling you lies?<br> The usual proportion.<br> You're right. I've been lying like mad.<br> I hate men. I loathe them.<br> If one of them so much as touches me,<br> I want to sink my teeth into his hands<br> and bite it off.<br> In fact, I did that once.<br> Do you care to hear about it?<br> Tell me anything you remember.<br> We were dancing.<br> He kept asking me to marry him,<br> panting in my ear.<br> I suddenly pretended<br> I was going to kiss him<br> and sank my teeth into his mustache<br> and bit it clear off.<br> You're laughing at me.<br> That smug frozen face of yours<br> doesn't take me in.<br> You just want me to tell you all this<br> so you can feel superior to me.<br> You and your drooling science.<br> I detest you.<br> I never want to see<br> that nasty face of yours again!<br> I can't bear you.<br> You and your nickel's worth of nothing!<br> Come on, Miss Carmichael.<br> Silly fool.<br> Letting a creature like that worry me.<br> Miss Frozen Puss.<br> Dr. Fleurot, I want to talk to you alone.<br> I can't stand that woman.<br> I'll see you later, Mary.<br> Come, Miss Carmichael.<br> Murchison must be really out of his mind<br> to assign Carmichael to you.<br> You may report your findings<br> to the new head when he arrives.<br> You can't treat a love veteran<br> like Carmichael<br> without some inside information.<br> I've done a great deal of research<br> on emotional problems<br> - and love difficulties.<br> - Research, my eye.<br> I've watched your work for six months.<br> It's brilliant but lifeless.<br> There's no intuition in it.<br> You approach all your problems<br> with an ice pack on your head.<br> - Are you making love to me?<br> - I will in a moment.<br> I'm just clearing the ground first.<br> I'm trying to convince you<br> that your lack of human and emotional experience<br> is bad for you as a doctor<br> and fatal for you as a woman.<br> I've heard that argument<br> from a number of amorous psychiatrists<br> who all wanted to make<br> a better doctor of me.<br> But I've got a much better argument.<br> - I'm terribly fond of you.<br> - Why?<br> It's rather like embracing a textbook.<br> - Why do you do it then?<br> - Because you're not a textbook.<br> You're a sweet, pulsing,<br> adorable woman underneath.<br> I sense it every time<br> I come near to you.<br> You sense only your own desires and pulsations.<br> I assure you,<br> mine in no way resemble them.<br> Stop it. I'm mad about you.<br> I'm afraid I'm boring you.<br> No. Your attitudes are very interesting.<br> You're exactly like Miss Carmichael.<br> I'd like to throw a book at you.<br> But I won't.<br> - May I borrow this?<br> - Certainly.<br> Oh, and forgive me for my criticism.<br> I think you'd better stick to books.<br> And another thing...<br> Pardon me for marching in,<br> but I'm spreading the tidings.<br> My successor will be due any moment.<br> Dr. Murchison, it's been a pleasure<br> working under you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Coming, Dr. Petersen?<br> I'm in no mad hurry to welcome Dr. Edwardes.<br> It's hard to imagine this place without you,<br> Dr. Murchison.<br> Yes, I sort of go with the fixtures.<br> More than that. You are Green Manors.<br> It seems unfair.<br> You're very young in the profession.<br> You haven't learned<br> the basic secret of science.<br> The old must make way for the new,<br> particularly when the old is suspected<br> of a touch of senility.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> I should think the Board of Directors<br> would realize you're feeling much better.<br> You've been like a new man<br> since your vacation.<br> The Board's as fair and all-knowing<br> as a hospital board can be.<br> I agree with you.<br> I'm as able and brilliant as ever.<br> But having crumbled once,<br> I might crumble again.<br> You were overworked.<br> A charming diagnosis for a broken-down horse.<br> I shall always remember<br> your cheerfulness today<br> as a lesson in how to accept reality,<br> Dr. Murchison.<br> Don't be too taken in<br> by my happy air, Constance.<br> It's the least difficult way<br> of saying goodbye to 20 years.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Come in.<br> - Your mail, Dr. Petersen and Mr. Garmes.<br> - Come in, Mr. Garmes.<br> You're not leaving today?<br> I'll see you again?<br> I shall hover around for a while<br> like an old mother hen.<br> At least until Dr. Edwardes<br> is firmly on the list.<br> How do you feel today, Mr. Garmes?<br> Somewhat better, Doctor.<br> The thing seems a little less troublesome.<br> May I do that for you, Doctor?<br> Thank you, no.<br> I can do this myself very well.<br> Please sit down.<br> I'll be with you in a moment.<br> - So that's the mighty Anthony Edwardes.<br> - He looks a little younger than I expected.<br> He's only brought one suitcase.<br> Perhaps he doesn't intend to remain very long.<br> Leave those daydreams to Dr. Murchison.<br> Gentlemen, our new chief,<br> Dr. Anthony Edwardes. Dr. Fleurot.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - I am Dr. Graff.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Dr. Hanish.<br> - How do you do?<br> There's still some staff members missing,<br> Dr. Edwardes.<br> These are your quarters.<br> They're very festive for an institution.<br> Dr. Edwardes, Dr. Murchison.<br> How do you do, Dr. Murchison?<br> I've heard a great deal about you, sir.<br> And I naturally about you.<br> - You're younger than I thought you'd be.<br> - My age hasn't caught up with me yet.<br> Mine has, it seems. I'm pleased to hand over<br> the reins to steadier hands.<br> I'm leaving you my library which contains,<br> amongst other items of interest,<br> your latest volume, The Labyrinth of the Guilt Complex.<br> An excellent work.<br> I hope Green Manors will inspire others as fine.<br> I'm very grateful.<br> I don't know the formal words<br> for an abdication, Dr. Edwardes.<br> May I say, merely, that these quarters<br> which I've occupied for 20 years<br> are now yours. Will you excuse me?<br> I spent a half-hour with Dr. Edwardes.<br> I must say, I was most favorably impressed.<br> I intend to learn a great deal<br> from Dr. Edwardes.<br> I think we all can,<br> from a man with such obvious talents.<br> - You're familiar with his work?<br> - Yes, I've read all his books.<br> A very keen, unorthodox mind.<br> It would be dreadful<br> if Dr. Murchison's successor was unworthy of him.<br> He's joining us.<br> I think you know everyone here,<br> Dr. Edwardes.<br> - No, not yet.<br> - Oh.<br> - This is Dr. Petersen.<br> - How do you do?<br> Dr. Edwardes.<br> Dr. Hanish has been showing me the grounds.<br> It's a remarkable institution,<br> Dr. Murchison.<br> - Must be quite beautiful in the summer.<br> - I pointed out to Dr. Edwardes<br> our various open-air diversions<br> for the patients.<br> Dr. Murchison always argued<br> we did not do enough in that direction,<br> and I agree with him.<br> Let me warn you that Dr. Petersen<br> is a frustrated gymnast.<br> Dr. Fleurot considers anything<br> beyond sitting and standing gymnastics.<br> I imagine you're very fond of sports.<br> Yes, I am, and I miss them,<br> particularly winter sports.<br> Did you show Dr. Edwardes the elm grove?<br> Yes, yes indeed.<br> That's where we hope to have<br> our new swimming pool.<br> I'm a great believer in the swimming pool.<br> There's a perfect spot for it<br> among the elms.<br> Not an oblong one,<br> but an irregular pool, something...<br> Something like this, you know.<br> Bathhouses should be here.<br> I take it that the supply of linen<br> at this institution is inexhaustible!<br> Forgive me.<br> That reminds me of my professor in psychiatry,<br> Dr. Brulov.<br> He could never stand a sauce bottle<br> on the table or even a salt shaker.<br> They took his appetite away.<br> I remember once at a banquet in his honor,<br> he refused to sit at the speaker's table<br> because he was completely surrounded by...<br> by ketchup.<br> Last night at dinner,<br> a dimple appeared in your cheek<br> that was never there before.<br> And I detected the outcroppings<br> of a mother instinct toward Dr. Edwardes.<br> I detest that sort of high-school talk.<br> Your reactions have upset<br> one of my pet theories about you.<br> To wit, that you were immune to psychoanalysts<br> and would end up in the arms<br> of some Boob McNutt with spiked hair.<br> If I were looking for that type, Dr. Fleurot,<br> I would long ago have adored you.<br> Come in.<br> Hi.<br> Excuse me, it's from Dr. Edwardes.<br> Love notes already.<br> The French school of science.<br> I didn't want to come to this institution,<br> but my brother insisted.<br> I can see no sense in it myself.<br> You see, I'm convinced I'm not suffering<br> from any hallucination<br> but that my guilt is very real.<br> I know, Dr. Edwardes,<br> that I killed my father.<br> And I'm willing to pay the penalty for it.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you for coming so soon.<br> I've been listening to Mr. Garmes<br> and thought you might help me out.<br> Mr. Garmes, you shouldn't<br> have disturbed Dr. Edwardes.<br> That's all right.<br> I'm very interested in Mr. Garmes' case.<br> I knew you would be. He fits perfectly<br> into your chapters on the guilt complex.<br> Would you mind telling me<br> what you're talking about?<br> You're here to see if we can cure your guilt complex<br> by psychoanalysis, Mr. Garmes.<br> But I have no guilt complex.<br> I know what I know.<br> - I killed my father and I...<br> - No, you didn't kill your father.<br> That's a misconception<br> that has taken hold of you.<br> I'm sorry, Doctor.<br> You were talking to him.<br> No, no, go on.<br> People often feel guilty<br> over something they never did.<br> It usually goes back to their childhood.<br> The child often wishes something terrible<br> would happen to someone,<br> and if something does happen<br> to that person,<br> the child believes he's caused it.<br> Then he grows up with a guilt complex<br> over a sin that was<br> only a child's bad dream.<br> What I am thinking isn't true, then?<br> No. In the course of analyzing yourself,<br> you'll see that.<br> Would you care to go back<br> to your room, Mr. Garmes?<br> Harry.<br> I think we'd better put him under drugs<br> for a few days.<br> He looks agitated.<br> His conviction is curious.<br> But you've encountered such cases<br> very often, Dr. Edwardes.<br> You described them perfectly in your book.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, so I did.<br> - Would you mind doing me a favor?<br> - Not at all, Doctor.<br> I've a headache. I'd like to take<br> the afternoon off. With you.<br> I understand you're not on duty<br> till after dinner.<br> - I intended typing out my notes.<br> - Please, I need a little fresh air<br> and you look as though<br> it might do you a bit of good.<br> I was going to lunch with Dr. Hanish.<br> He has an interesting new patient, a kleptomaniac.<br> Kleptomaniacs for lunch?<br> They'll steal the food right out of your mouth.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello? Yes. Dr. Edwardes.<br> What? Yes, Anthony Edwardes.<br> Who?<br> Sorry, I don't get your name.<br> Norma Cramer?<br> Please, Miss Cramer,<br> I'm very busy and I don't know you.<br> Some girl claiming to be...<br> I hate practical jokes, don't you?<br> People calling you up and chirping,<br> "Guess who I am."<br> Sounds like some ex-patient of yours.<br> They're always full of coy little tricks.<br> Very likely. Come on, let's go.<br> We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass,<br> and clouds without complexes.<br> I think the greatest harm done<br> to the human race<br> has been done by the poets.<br> Poets are dull boys, most of them,<br> but not especially fiendish.<br> But they keep filling people's heads<br> with delusions about love,<br> writing about it as if it were a<br> symphony orchestra, a flight of angels.<br> - Which it isn't, eh?<br> - Of course not.<br> People fall in love, as they put it,<br> because they respond<br> to a certain hair coloring,<br> or vocal tones or mannerisms<br> that remind them of their parents.<br> Or sometimes, for no reason at all.<br> But that's not the point. The point is<br> that people read about love as one thing<br> and experience it as another.<br> They expect kisses to be<br> like lyrical poems<br> and embraces to be<br> like Shakespearean dramas.<br> And when they find out differently,<br> then they get sick<br> and they have to be analyzed, eh?<br> Yes, very often.<br> Professor, you're suffering<br> from mogo on the go-go.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> - You can't get through there like that.<br> - I can. I've done it many times.<br> - You hurt?<br> - No, not at all.<br> - Here.<br> - No, I'm perfectly all right.<br> I've usually gone on picnics here alone.<br> That doesn't sound like much fun.<br> I haven't gone in for fun,<br> as you call it.<br> Isn't this beautiful?<br> Perfect.<br> Oh, lunch. Lunch. What will you have?<br> Ham or liverwurst?<br> Liverwurst.<br> Has anybody seen our new chief today?<br> He has been tied up.<br> He frisked off with Dr. Petersen at noon.<br> It's odd spending his first day<br> running after Dr. Petersen<br> like a drooling college boy.<br> It'll do Constance good<br> to be drooled over.<br> Poor girl's withering away with science.<br> I was telling her only recently<br> that something vital<br> was missing from her life.<br> Please don't get up.<br> I just came in because<br> I learned Mr. Garmes<br> became agitated again this afternoon.<br> - Yes, I gave him a sedative.<br> - I'm very sorry I wasn't here.<br> Nonsense. You look as if<br> you had an instructive time.<br> - Instructive?<br> - Gentlemen, notice her stocking.<br> The lady's been climbing trees.<br> Or lolling in a briar patch.<br> No, it's trees.<br> There are two leaves in her hair.<br> Allow me, Dr. Petersen.<br> You're surpassing yourself<br> as a charmer, Dr. Fleurot.<br> Don't run away. Do have some coffee.<br> Dr. Petersen's already eaten,<br> as one can tell by the mustard<br> on her right forefinger.<br> I would say hot dogs<br> on the state highway.<br> Would you really? Your diagnosis is,<br> as usual, wrong, Dr. Fleurot.<br> Not hot dogs, liverwurst.<br> I'm very sorry, I have to leave this nursery.<br> I must see Mr. Garmes.<br> It looks as if we have Casanova himself<br> at the head of Green Manors.<br> Did you notice her blush<br> every time we mentioned his name?<br> It's very late.<br> I was going to read your new book again.<br> I would like to discuss it.<br> I have never discussed an author's work with him.<br> Of course, at school,<br> we had several literary professors,<br> but that was quite different.<br> I sound rather nervous, don't I?<br> Not at all.<br> I thought I wanted to discuss<br> your book with you.<br> I'm amazed at the subterfuge.<br> I don't want to discuss it at all.<br> I understand.<br> It's quite remarkable to discover<br> that one isn't what one thought one was.<br> I mean, I've always been entirely aware<br> of what was in my mind.<br> And you're not now?<br> It's quite ridiculous.<br> It was stupid of me to come in here<br> like a distracted child.<br> You're very lovely.<br> Please don't talk that way.<br> You'll think I came in to hear that.<br> I know why you came in.<br> Why?<br> Because something has happened to us.<br> But it doesn't happen like that,<br> in a day.<br> It happens in a moment sometimes.<br> I felt it this afternoon.<br> It was like lightning striking.<br> It strikes rarely.<br> I don't understand how it happened.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's not you.<br> Something about your robe.<br> My robe? I don't understand.<br> Forgive me. Something struck me.<br> I've been having a rather bad time<br> with my nerves lately. Your robe...<br> - I mean, the dark lines.<br> - You're ill.<br> I'll be all right.<br> Hello. Yes, Dr. Edwardes.<br> Yes. Yes. What? Where is he?<br> I'll be there right away.<br> Mr. Garmes, he's run amuck.<br> Tried to murder Fleurot, then cut his own throat.<br> - Is it bad?<br> - I think so. He's in surgery.<br> I'll be right along.<br> He's lost a lot of blood,<br> but I think he'll pull through.<br> - What's the pulse?<br> - 140.<br> It's going down.<br> - Why are the lights out in the corridor?<br> - What do you mean?<br> It's dark. That's why he did it.<br> Because the lights are out.<br> Turn them on!<br> Doors, unlock them!<br> - You can't keep people in cells.<br> - Dr. Edwardes.<br> Fools babbling about guilt complexes.<br> What do you know about them?<br> He did it.<br> He told me he killed his father.<br> Put the lights on. Quick!<br> It's dark. It's dark.<br> - He's in collapse.<br> - He's ill.<br> He didn't look like a heart case.<br> Not heart, shock of some sort.<br> Must be brought about by exhaustion.<br> Take him up to his room.<br> I'll take care of him.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I suppose I made quite an exhibition of myself.<br> Who brought me down here? You?<br> It's rather a mess.<br> Going to pieces in surgery.<br> Who are you?<br> I remember now.<br> Edwardes is dead.<br> I killed him and took his place.<br> I'm someone else, I don't know who.<br> I killed him. Edwardes.<br> I have no memory.<br> It's like looking into a mirror<br> and seeing nothing but the mirror.<br> Yet the image is there.<br> I know it's there.<br> I exist, I'm there.<br> How can a man lose his memory,<br> his name, everything he's ever known,<br> and still talk like this,<br> as if he were quite sane?<br> - Are you afraid of me?<br> - No. You're ill.<br> Loss of memory is not a difficult problem.<br> Yes, I know, amnesia.<br> A trick of the mind for remaining sane.<br> You remain sane by forgetting<br> something too horrible to remember.<br> You put the horrible thing<br> behind a closed door.<br> We have to open that door.<br> - I know what's behind that door. Murder.<br> - No!<br> That's a delusion you have acquired<br> out of illness.<br> Will you answer me truthfully<br> and trust me?<br> I trust you, but it's no use.<br> I can't think. I don't know who I am.<br> I don't know, I don't know.<br> Who telephoned you yesterday?<br> - Telephoned me?<br> - Yes. There in the office.<br> Yes, I remember.<br> What did she say?<br> She said she was my office assistant.<br> She was worried about me, hadn't heard.<br> You mean she was Dr. Edwardes' assistant<br> and hadn't heard from him.<br> What else did she say?<br> She didn't recognize my voice,<br> that I wasn't Dr. Edwardes.<br> - You hung up in anger?<br> - I was confused.<br> My head ached.<br> - Was that your first doubt?<br> - First doubt?<br> The first time you became confused as Edwardes?<br> Did anything else happen before that?<br> Yes.<br> When I was in the hotel room<br> packing to come here<br> I found a cigarette case in my coat.<br> It frightened me.<br> I didn't know why it should.<br> Here.<br> The initials J.B. See them?<br> When I saw them in the hotel room,<br> they made my head ache.<br> Well, they're probably your initials.<br> J.B., J.B.<br> You must sleep. I think...<br> When you wake up, you'll be able to tell me more,<br> - if you trust me.<br> - I trust you.<br> It's late. You'd better get some sleep yourself.<br> I'll be all right.<br> I'm sure there will be no police inquiry<br> for a few days.<br> We'll talk about it<br> and straighten everything out<br> before anything happens.<br> I'll come in in the morning<br> and report you too ill for service.<br> I have been in Dr. Edwardes' office<br> for five years,<br> and the man who spoke to me<br> is not Dr. Edwardes.<br> He let me have my vacation<br> when he left on his.<br> I was very worried<br> when I didn't hear from him last week.<br> Then I thought he might have just come here<br> without reopening his office.<br> - That's why I telephoned.<br> - Show them the picture.<br> Yes.<br> - That's a different man.<br> - He was taking a chance.<br> Somebody might have known<br> what Edwardes looked like.<br> You never saw the real Edwardes?<br> No, I never met him.<br> But I felt something was wrong<br> from the moment our man appeared.<br> He didn't impress me as a scientist.<br> Last night when he collapsed,<br> I became actually alarmed.<br> What do you think<br> made him break down last night?<br> It's obvious now. Garmes.<br> Our impostor, I'm almost certain,<br> is an amnesia case.<br> Garmes brought him back to reality<br> for an instant.<br> Being unable to face the truth<br> of who he was, he collapsed.<br> - You think he may have killed Edwardes?<br> - There's no question of it.<br> He killed Dr. Edwardes and took his place<br> in order to conceal his crime<br> by pretending the victim<br> was still alive.<br> This sort of unrealistic act<br> is typical of the shortsighted cunning<br> that goes with paranoid behavior.<br> We're wasting time, gentlemen.<br> His room is upstairs.<br> Oh. Uh, this is Dr. Petersen.<br> - These gentlemen are from the police.<br> - The police?<br> - What has happened?<br> - Nothing to be alarmed about.<br> Our Dr. Edwardes turns out<br> to be a paranoid impostor.<br> He's very likely guilty<br> of having murdered the real Edwardes.<br> He's disappeared.<br> He is not in his room?<br> - You left him in his room, miss?<br> - Yes.<br> Did he say anything about himself,<br> about why he broke down?<br> No. He was not himself.<br> He was unable to speak coherently.<br> You don't seem very surprised to learn<br> that this Dr. Edwardes is a fake<br> and may be guilty of murder.<br> I'm used to such surprises in my work.<br> You suspected something then?<br> No. I thought his collapse<br> due to mental strain.<br> That's a funny diagnosis for a fellow<br> who's supposed to have<br> just come from vacation.<br> I made no medical diagnosis.<br> I was shocked to see him collapse<br> and didn't think beyond that.<br> We were all pretty shocked, Sheriff.<br> The fellow took us all in.<br> All except Dr. Murchison.<br> And he didn't say anything<br> that might give you an idea of where he went?<br> No.<br> He may be hanging around.<br> We'll have to go over the grounds first.<br> I'm sorry this has happened to you, Constance.<br> I felt like warning you about him,<br> but I wasn't certain.<br> Don't worry. It's not your fault.<br> They're bound to find him.<br> I'll keep you informed<br> of the police activities.<br> I say the fellow expected to get away with it<br> like any criminal.<br> Nonsense. Obviously, a case of amnesia.<br> He hadn't the faintest notion<br> of who he was or what he was doing.<br> What do you say, Constance?<br> I don't know.<br> You know, if you were anybody<br> but Constance Petersen, the human glacier<br> and the custodian of truth, I'd say...<br> Yes, you'd say what?<br> My dear, forgive me my scurvy thoughts.<br> You are telling the truth.<br> I was going to say<br> that you were holding something back.<br> I'm a sentimental ass.<br> A woman like you<br> could never become involved emotionally<br> with any man, sane or insane.<br> I suggest you change the subject, Fleurot.<br> I would be very interested<br> to ask him certain questions<br> when they bring him back here.<br> No matter what you think.<br> You'll never ask our mystery man<br> any questions.<br> Why not?<br> For the very good reason,<br> the police will never find him alive.<br> Amnesia case of that sort<br> with the police after him,<br> it's an obvious suicide.<br> The fellow'll put an end<br> to his pain and nightmare fantasies<br> either by blowing his brains out<br> or dropping himself out of a window.<br> You're offending Dr. Petersen<br> with your callousness.<br> I'm sorry, Constance, that our staff<br> retains the manners of medical students.<br> I'm not offended.<br> I think Dr. Fleurot's ideas are quite accurate,<br> but I'm rather tired. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> The police have asked me to announce<br> that our neighborhood roads<br> are free of the dangerous madman<br> who escaped from Green Manors.<br> The search for the impostor<br> has shifted to Manhattan.<br> This is WQZK Brooklyn, George Bell.<br> We now resume our regularly scheduled program.<br> Sure feels good<br> to take the weight off your feet.<br> I'm from Pittsburgh.<br> There's a town for you.<br> Really can meet people in Pittsburgh.<br> Friendly.<br> Fellow could live and die in this town,<br> and he couldn't meet nobody.<br> How about you and me<br> having a nice little drink together<br> now that we're acquainted?<br> No, thank you.<br> You don't have to be so snooty about it.<br> I'll have you know, madam,<br> that I know better people than you in Pittsburgh.<br> Yeah, I'm sure you're a great social success,<br> given half a chance.<br> Now you're talking.<br> Do you mind not sitting in my lap in public?<br> That's enough of that.<br> Beat it.<br> I'll have you know, I'm a guest in this hotel.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> I'm the house detective. Get going.<br> This town's getting worse and worse.<br> That's all right, lady,<br> you don't have to go.<br> I'm sorry you were being annoyed.<br> I've been watching you for some time,<br> and I figured something like this<br> might happen.<br> The chief duty of a house detective<br> is to spot trouble in advance.<br> - You're not registered here, are you?<br> - No.<br> I didn't think so,<br> the way you were wandering around.<br> Looking for somebody?<br> Don't be afraid of me.<br> I've got you spotted as a lady in trouble<br> and from out of town.<br> Schoolteacher or librarian, which is it?<br> - Schoolteacher.<br> - I thought so.<br> They always look like<br> they just lost something.<br> - Maybe I can help you.<br> - I don't think so, thank you.<br> Looking for some man, I suppose.<br> Must be a relative.<br> And from the worried look,<br> I'd say a pretty close one.<br> A husband, for instance.<br> - I'm really amazed.<br> - I hit it, huh?<br> But how could you tell?<br> I'm a kind of a psychologist.<br> You know, you got to be in my line.<br> Now, would you mind filling in<br> a few of the blank spaces for me?<br> No. It's just that we quarreled.<br> And then you got sorry and came running after him.<br> That's the usual psychology.<br> But now you're afraid to face him.<br> No, no.<br> It's that I don't know<br> what room he's in.<br> He told a friend he was coming to this hotel<br> but under a different name<br> so I couldn't find him.<br> But I must find him and apologize<br> and make him feel better.<br> When did he arrive here?<br> Yesterday morning.<br> Give me a description of him.<br> He's very tall and attractive.<br> Dark hair, a rather rugged face<br> and brown eyes and one suitcase.<br> I'll go check on him.<br> Did you find him?<br> Well, I think we got a line.<br> About 25 guys answering your description<br> registered here yesterday.<br> These are their registration cards.<br> You might recognize the handwriting.<br> That's very clever of you.<br> - This is his handwriting.<br> - John Brown, huh?<br> Not much imagination for an alias.<br> Room 3033.<br> Thank you very much. I was going<br> to sit here all day watching for him.<br> I know you would. I'm glad to be of service.<br> I'm a married man myself<br> and I know how it feels to have a wife<br> come chasing after you to apologize.<br> Constance.<br> What did you come for?<br> You don't owe me anything.<br> I'm going to do what I want to do.<br> Take care of you, cure you,<br> and remain with you till that happens.<br> But you can't,<br> you can't help hide a criminal.<br> You're not going to jeopardize<br> your standing as a doctor.<br> You're just getting started.<br> I won't let you be stupid about it.<br> I couldn't bear it away from you.<br> I went through yesterday holding my breath<br> as if I were being hunted.<br> I couldn't eat or work or do anything<br> but think of you.<br> So I had to come.<br> I'll get a room on this floor.<br> I'm here as your doctor only.<br> It has nothing to do with love.<br> Nothing at all.<br> Nothing at all.<br> Try remembering.<br> Let your mind go back to your childhood.<br> Was it happy?<br> Whom did you know in your childhood?<br> I'm haunted, but I...<br> I can't see by what.<br> - It's no use.<br> - You lived somewhere.<br> You had a mother, you were loved,<br> you had friends.<br> Yes. Probably a wife.<br> Can you remember her?<br> I didn't say I had one.<br> I said I probably had.<br> No, darling. Thank heaven,<br> I can't remember a wife.<br> I would like to ask you<br> a medical question.<br> Constance, would you mind not prodding me?<br> It mixes me up.<br> I can't remember anything.<br> Except that I love you.<br> How would you diagnose a pain<br> in the right upper quadrant?<br> A pain that is persistent?<br> Gall bladder, possibly a heart case,<br> or pneumonia,<br> depending on the patient's history.<br> It's obvious you're a doctor.<br> Yes. The eminent Dr. X.<br> And if we can unlock one tiny memory,<br> it will give us a key to the others.<br> No.<br> The only thing that comes to my mind<br> that I keep thinking over and over,<br> - is the logic of the situation.<br> - What logic?<br> That it was I who was with Edwardes.<br> "Police believe the impostor<br> who escaped from Green Manors<br> "to be the patient who visited<br> the real Dr. Edwardes<br> "in the Cumberland Mountains<br> the day that the noted psychiatrist disappeared.<br> "No trace of Dr. Edwardes has been found<br> since he left the Cumberland Resort<br> "in the company of his supposed patient."<br> - Do you remember that?<br> - No.<br> Why do you believe then<br> that you were with him?<br> Because wherever we went,<br> I came back with his identity.<br> I wouldn't have come back as Dr. Edwardes<br> if I hadn't known that he was dead.<br> How would I know that he was dead<br> if I hadn't been with him when he died?<br> Were you?<br> I don't remember,<br> but, logically, I know that I must have been.<br> Logically, I also know<br> why the body hasn't been found.<br> Because it was hidden by me.<br> Don't you see<br> that you are imagining all this?<br> You call yourself names.<br> You insist without proof that you're a murderer.<br> You know what that is, don't you?<br> Whoever you are,<br> it's a guilt complex that speaks for you.<br> A guilt fantasy that goes way back<br> to your childhood.<br> I think you're quite mad.<br> You're much crazier than I<br> to do all this<br> for a creature without a name,<br> to run off with a pair of initials.<br> The police have not given your name<br> or case history to the papers.<br> That must mean one thing.<br> That your name was not in Dr. Edwardes' files.<br> You were in an accident.<br> Where was it?<br> What happened to your hand?<br> Your hand was burned.<br> You've had an operation<br> in the last six months.<br> A skin graft. Third degree burns.<br> Your hand was burned. Where?<br> - It hurts.<br> - Try remembering.<br> My hand hurts.<br> Your hand is remembering.<br> Open your mind and the pain will leave.<br> - Where did it happen?<br> - I can't. It hurts.<br> - What happened?<br> - It's burning. My hand's burning.<br> Try to remember.<br> - My dear, are you all right?<br> - I'm all right. What happened?<br> You relived an accident you've been in.<br> But the memory only touched<br> the part of your mind that feels.<br> But it's a beginning. It really is.<br> You'll feel better soon.<br> Who could that be?<br> I know. I sent down<br> for the later editions of the papers.<br> - You ordered the afternoon papers?<br> - Yes.<br> - They came. I brought them right up.<br> - Just a minute.<br> - Here you are. Thank you.<br> - Thanks.<br> My picture's in the paper.<br> He recognized me.<br> We've got to go. Quick.<br> We can't pack.<br> Listen, when you left the mountains,<br> you must have passed through New York.<br> Wherever you came from,<br> wherever you went,<br> you must've been in a railroad station.<br> You must have heard Edwardes<br> ask for tickets to somewhere.<br> - I don't remember.<br> - You will.<br> When you come to the ticket window,<br> try to relive that other time with Edwardes.<br> Try to repeat what was said then.<br> Ask for the same tickets.<br> I'll try.<br> One, Philadelphia.<br> Philadelphia. $3.39, including the total<br> with tax. Thank you.<br> You went someplace with Edwardes.<br> Ask for tickets to that same place.<br> $8.46, including tax. Thank you.<br> What is it?<br> What do you want, sir?<br> Can you please step aside?<br> I want two tickets.<br> Where to?<br> Rome.<br> - Rome.<br> - To where?<br> - Rome.<br> - What Rome?<br> He means Rome, Georgia.<br> Is there anything wrong?<br> My husband is ill. I'm taking him home.<br> Here you are.<br> Two tickets to Rome, Georgia.<br> He'll be all right in a minute.<br> These dizzy spells go away quickly.<br> - He looks sick. I'll call a doctor.<br> - No, no, he'll be all right.<br> Do you feel better now, darling?<br> Darling?<br> Pull yourself together.<br> You're all right.<br> When does the train for Rome leave?<br> Birmingham Special.<br> Leaves in 10 minutes. Track 17.<br> - I feel better now.<br> - Thank you.<br> That's all right, I'll take him to the train<br> in case anything happens.<br> He has recovered now.<br> You're very nice to offer help,<br> but I can get along. Thank you.<br> Act as if we are taking this train.<br> We walk down-aways and then turn back.<br> - What's the matter with this train?<br> - The policeman heard us buy the tickets.<br> - Did he act suspicious?<br> - No, he was very nice.<br> But when he goes<br> to the police station tonight,<br> he may find descriptions of us posted<br> and he'll remember us.<br> They'll telegraph Rome, Georgia,<br> and have us picked up.<br> We can't go back to the hotel.<br> They'll have a million police there by now.<br> We're not going back.<br> We're going to Rochester.<br> Come on, we'll go over<br> to the Grand Central Station.<br> By the way, what are we going<br> to Rochester for?<br> We're going to visit Dr. Brulov.<br> That's the fellow who doesn't like<br> sauce bottles.<br> He was my analyst.<br> He psychoanalyzed me.<br> Really? What was wrong with you?<br> All analysts have to be psychoanalyzed<br> by other analysts<br> before they start practicing.<br> That's to make sure<br> that they're not too crazy.<br> Apparently, the mind is never too ill<br> to make jokes about psychoanalysis.<br> I'm sorry. I'm a pig.<br> I am. I keep forgetting you're a patient.<br> So do I.<br> When I hold you like this,<br> I feel entirely well.<br> Will you love me just as much<br> when I'm normal?<br> I'll be insane about you.<br> I am normal.<br> At least, there's nothing wrong with me<br> that a nice, long kiss wouldn't cure.<br> I've never treated a guilt complex<br> that way before.<br> - We don't want to attract attention.<br> - Everybody's doing it.<br> - You both going?<br> - Yes.<br> Don't read the paper.<br> Let's pick up where we left off.<br> Pick up what?<br> Try to recall the first moment you thought<br> you were Edwardes.<br> - Darling, I have a confession to make.<br> - Yes, I'm listening.<br> As a doctor, you irritate me.<br> I sit here swooning with love,<br> and then suddenly you ask me a question<br> and I don't like you anymore.<br> Do you have to sit there smiling at me<br> like some smug know-it-all schoolteacher?<br> I can't help smiling.<br> That's what happens in analysis.<br> As the doctor begins to uncover the truth<br> for the patient,<br> said patient develops a fine,<br> hearty hatred of said doctor.<br> You're going to hate me a great deal<br> before we're through.<br> - And you're gonna like that.<br> - As a scientist, yes.<br> And if I shall happen to biff you one,<br> you'll consider that sort of a diploma.<br> Yes, but don't biff too hard.<br> No, I think we should go on<br> with our investigation.<br> We have some new facts<br> to work with now.<br> - What facts?<br> - You're a doctor,<br> you were in an accident,<br> your hand and forearm were burned,<br> - and you were in Rome.<br> - I was never in Rome in my life.<br> You were either there or going there.<br> You remembered something, no doubt<br> connected with the burning of your hand.<br> Rome. Think of Rome.<br> Maybe Rome, Italy.<br> When did you go to Rome?<br> What did you do in Rome?<br> Think.<br> Rome.<br> Yes. I remember something.<br> - Fighter planes spotted us.<br> - You were flying?<br> Transport, Medical Corps.<br> Over Rome, heading north.<br> - What happened?<br> - They hit us.<br> Caught fire. Uniform burned.<br> Bailed out.<br> What else?<br> I don't know. It blacks out.<br> You left the Army?<br> Yeah.<br> I probably deserted. I hated it.<br> I hated killing.<br> I can remember that much.<br> Your guilt fantasies were obviously inflamed<br> by your duties as a soldier.<br> Stop it.<br> Babbling like some phony King Solomon!<br> Sit there full of half-witted devil talk<br> that doesn't make sense!<br> If there's anything I hate,<br> it's a smug woman!<br> Darling, we're just beginning.<br> Don't biff too hard yet.<br> I worked as Dr. Brulov's assistant for a year,<br> right after my internship.<br> He got me the post at Green Manors.<br> You'll like Alex.<br> I doubt that.<br> One psychoanalyst in my hair's enough.<br> - What are you gonna tell him?<br> - That we are on our honeymoon.<br> Doctor, you think of<br> the most wonderful prescriptions.<br> - Good evening. Is Dr. Brulov in?<br> - No, he went out right after dinner.<br> He ought to be back soon.<br> Would you mind telling him<br> I've left his supper on the table?<br> I'm sorry, but I can't wait any longer.<br> There are two gentlemen<br> waiting for him in there.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> How's your mother been lately?<br> She's still complaining about rheumatism.<br> She figures I ought to get transferred<br> down to Florida.<br> I said, "Do you expect me<br> to sacrifice all chance of promotion<br> "just because you've got rheumatism?"<br> Did you take the subject up with Hennessy?<br> Yeah. He said a transfer could be arranged,<br> but I'd probably have to start<br> all over again as a sergeant.<br> I said, "Personally, I think that's unfair.<br> "After all the work I did<br> on that narcotics case."<br> What did Hennessy say to that?<br> A lot of things. He made some crack<br> about me being a mama's boy.<br> Pardon me. That may be for me.<br> I gave headquarters this number.<br> Hello.<br> Yes. This is Lieutenant Cooley.<br> Any new developments?<br> When did you find that out?<br> No. Right. I'll be down later. Goodbye.<br> Alex.<br> Who is it, please?<br> My old friend!<br> - Alex.<br> - My dear darling.<br> I didn't have time to let you know.<br> I just arrived.<br> Imagine I find you here.<br> I would have come home quicker.<br> I was giving a lecture at the Army Hospital.<br> - Are these gentlemen with you?<br> - No. I'm here with...<br> Dr. Brulov, I'm Lieutenant Cooley<br> of Central Station.<br> - This is Sergeant Gillespie.<br> - What for?<br> We thought you might give us<br> some data on Dr. Edwardes.<br> Data?<br> What is this kind of persecution?<br> I told the policeman yesterday<br> I know nothing about Edwardes.<br> But yesterday, you had some kind of theory.<br> I explained to the policeman<br> that if Edwardes took along with him<br> on a vacation<br> a paranoid patient,<br> he was a bigger fool<br> than I ever knew he was.<br> It is the same as playing with a loaded gun.<br> Do you think this patient<br> might have killed him?<br> I'm not thinking anything.<br> I'm not a bloodhound.<br> Was Dr. Edwardes a great friend of yours?<br> What are you talking about?<br> The man was impossible.<br> You had a quarrel with him<br> when you were back in New York, I understand.<br> Not New York.<br> In Boston at the psychiatry convention.<br> What kind of an analyst is it<br> who wants to cure psychosis<br> by taking people skating<br> or to a bowling alley?<br> I understand you threatened<br> to punch his nose.<br> All I did was get up and walk out,<br> and kick over a few chairs<br> which nobody was sitting in.<br> So you don't have to ask me<br> any more questions.<br> You have now the facts.<br> Well, thank you very much.<br> I'm sorry to have bothered you.<br> If anything turns up,<br> we'll let you know. Goodbye, ma'am.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> - Good night.<br> What do you suppose<br> they are snooping around me for?<br> Next they will give me the third degree.<br> Alex, I'm so glad to see you.<br> I was going to write to you<br> but it happened so suddenly.<br> I got married.<br> Who is married?<br> Why, Alex, my husband, John Brown.<br> - I'm glad to meet you officially.<br> - So you are married.<br> There is nothing so nice<br> as a new marriage.<br> No psychoses yet, no aggressions,<br> no guilt complexes.<br> I congratulate you<br> and wish you have babies<br> and not phobias.<br> How about we have a glass of beer<br> like in the old days?<br> The truth is that we have no hotel room.<br> All the hotels were so crowded.<br> What do you want with a hotel?<br> That's for millionaires,<br> not for lovebirds on a honeymoon.<br> You will stay right here.<br> Look how I'm living by myself<br> with a can opener.<br> My housekeeper has gone to war,<br> my secretary is a WAC.<br> And I've got a cleaning woman<br> who can't cook and who hates me.<br> Cook me my coffee in the morning,<br> and the house is yours.<br> - That's wonderful of you, Alex.<br> - There's nothing wonderful about me.<br> It's nice to see my old assistant.<br> The youngest, but the best one I ever had.<br> But who knows now.<br> As my old friend Zannenbaum used to say,<br> "Women make the best psychoanalysts,<br> "till they fall in love.<br> "After that, they make the best patients."<br> Good night and happy dreams,<br> which we will analyze at breakfast.<br> Good night, Dr. Brulov.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> Any husband of Constance<br> is a husband of mine, so to speak.<br> - Good night, Alex.<br> - Good night.<br> - You were superb with the police.<br> - Was I?<br> Carried it off like a grade-A gun monger.<br> I felt terribly stupid for a few minutes<br> but it turned out very well.<br> Providing the professor<br> isn't wiser than he seems.<br> Alex? No.<br> Things are different here.<br> Someone's been here since my time.<br> Alex didn't think anything.<br> He's sweet.<br> He may be sweet, but he didn't<br> even ask us where our bags were.<br> Alex is always like that,<br> in a complete dream state socially.<br> Do you know, this room<br> does look changed,<br> but it isn't.<br> It's I who have changed.<br> It's called transfer of affects.<br> What is?<br> The fact that everything seems<br> so wonderful in this room.<br> That's what it's called, is it?<br> Did the police disturb you?<br> No. One ignores such trifles<br> on a honeymoon.<br> - I take it this is your first honeymoon?<br> - Yes.<br> I mean, it would be if it were.<br> For what it's worth, I can't remember<br> ever having kissed any other woman before.<br> I have nothing to remember<br> of that nature, either.<br> You're very sweet.<br> - Of course I'm no child.<br> - Far from it.<br> I'm well aware that we're all<br> bundles of inhibitions.<br> Dynamite dumps!<br> No.<br> - Please don't do that.<br> - Why not?<br> It isn't ethical.<br> I'm here as your doctor.<br> Well, you can stop worrying, Doctor.<br> I'm going to sleep on the couch.<br> No, that's also unethical.<br> Now, this honeymoon is complicated enough<br> without your dragging<br> medical ethics into it.<br> - I suppose the floor is out?<br> - The patient always sleeps in the bed.<br> The doctor occupies the couch,<br> fully dressed.<br> I see you know the rules.<br> You remember something.<br> No.<br> This room reminds you of something.<br> No.<br> You're resisting a memory.<br> What is in your mind?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Yes, you do! You're resisting it.<br> Don't start that again.<br> Don't stand there with that wiseacre look.<br> I'm sick of your double talk.<br> You were looking at the bed.<br> What frightens you?<br> White lines.<br> When I made fork marks on the tablecloth,<br> they agitated you.<br> The night you kissed me,<br> you pushed me away because of my robe.<br> It was white, it had dark lines on it.<br> Try to think. Why does the color white frighten you?<br> Why do lines frighten you?<br> - Think of white. White.<br> - It frightens me. I can't look.<br> Don't turn away. Stand still.<br> Look at the white spread. Look at it, remember!<br> Darling.<br> Oh, darling.<br> You mustn't be frightened.<br> You mustn't. We are making progress.<br> We have the word "white" on our side.<br> Is that you, Mr. Brown?<br> Oh, I thought it was you.<br> I was unable to sleep,<br> so I came down to work.<br> When you are old,<br> you don't need to sleep so much.<br> I'm just having a glass of milk<br> and some crackers.<br> Join me, please.<br> I'll get another glass.<br> I'm glad to have company.<br> Nobody likes to have<br> crackers and milk by himself.<br> When I was a young man,<br> I was always saying,<br> "If I could only get alone by myself<br> "instead of wasting my time with people,<br> "I would be happy."<br> Now I am saying just the opposite.<br> This is the secret of old age.<br> Everything becomes just the opposite.<br> Do you know who makes<br> the most trouble in the world?<br> Old people.<br> They are always worrying<br> what is going to be in the world tomorrow<br> after they are gone.<br> That's why they have wars.<br> Because old people got nothing else<br> they can get excited about.<br> Well, we will drink to you,<br> to when we are young<br> and know nothing except living.<br> Alex. Alex, are you all right?<br> Good morning.<br> Yes, I am all right, thank you.<br> - I fell asleep in the chair.<br> - Yes.<br> - What time is it?<br> - 7:00.<br> I was dreaming this morning<br> I get some real coffee.<br> My husband must have gone out very early<br> this morning. You didn't happen...<br> He didn't go out.<br> He's over there on the couch.<br> He's all right. He's sleeping fine.<br> My dear child, do you think<br> old Alex Brulov,<br> one of the biggest brains<br> who is in psychiatry,<br> is unable to make out<br> two and two come out four?<br> I should have known.<br> The moment I see you with a husband<br> whose pupils are enlarged,<br> who has a tremor of the left hand,<br> who's on a honeymoon with no baggage,<br> and whose name is John Brown,<br> I know practically what is going on.<br> What happened?<br> Only what I expected.<br> There is no use taking chances<br> with a possibly dangerous case.<br> I sit here waiting.<br> If you scream, I am ready.<br> So he comes downstairs,<br> and he's dangerous.<br> I can see by his face.<br> So I keep talking<br> while I put some bromide<br> into a glass of milk.<br> Enough to knock out three horses.<br> When he falls down,<br> I run up to see you.<br> You are sleeping like a baby,<br> and I come back here to watch out.<br> The struggle against his condition<br> agitates him at times,<br> but there's no danger in him.<br> This is what I found<br> in his hand last night.<br> He didn't know he had that.<br> Alex, you mustn't think that.<br> He didn't try to do anything to you,<br> he couldn't.<br> My dear child, he's not responsible.<br> But that's not correct.<br> I'm just a little more experienced<br> with his type than you.<br> I grant you know infinitely more than I do<br> but in this...<br> Do not complete this sentence<br> with the usual female contradictions.<br> You grant me I know more than you.<br> But on the other hand<br> you know more than me.<br> - Women's talk.<br> - Alex, what are you going to do?<br> Something more for you, than for me.<br> I'm calling the police.<br> - No, no, please...<br> - You are giving me orders. My own pupil.<br> You don't know this man,<br> you know only science.<br> You know his mind,<br> but you don't know his heart.<br> We are speaking of a schizophrenic,<br> and not a valentine.<br> We are speaking of a man.<br> Oh.<br> I see. Love.<br> Look at you.<br> Dr. Petersen, the promising psychoanalyst,<br> is now all of a sudden<br> a schoolgirl in love with an actor,<br> nothing else.<br> - Alex, let me tell you about him.<br> - What is there for you to say?<br> We both know that the mind<br> of a woman in love<br> is operating on the lowest level<br> of the intellect.<br> Doctor told me not to smoke in the morning,<br> but I am too excited.<br> You're right.<br> I'm not an analyst, not even a doctor.<br> I'm not talking to you as one.<br> But believe me, not what I say,<br> but what I feel.<br> The mind isn't everything.<br> The heart can see deeper sometimes.<br> The shock of a police investigation<br> might ruin his chances for recovery,<br> and I can save him.<br> But if he killed Dr. Edwardes,<br> how can you help him?<br> He didn't, he didn't.<br> But if it turns out he did,<br> which I am good and certain it will.<br> It won't. You yourself taught me<br> what Freud says.<br> A man cannot do anything in amnesia<br> that his real character wouldn't have done.<br> And how do you know<br> what his real character is?<br> I know. I know.<br> She knows.<br> This is the way science goes backward.<br> Who told you what he is?<br> Freud? Or a crystal ball?<br> I couldn't feel this way toward a man<br> who was bad,<br> who had committed murder.<br> I couldn't feel this pain<br> for someone who was evil.<br> You are 20 times crazier than him.<br> "She couldn't love him<br> if he was no good."<br> This is baby talk, nothing else.<br> What do you want I should do?<br> Give me time to treat him and cure him<br> before the police find him,<br> and shock him into an incurable condition.<br> - This could take a year.<br> - No. No, no.<br> All right, half a year?<br> We should sit and hide for half a year,<br> waiting to find out if he's going<br> to cut your throat, my throat,<br> and set fire to the house.<br> Oh, my dear girl.<br> Even to a woman in love,<br> such a situation must seem<br> a little unreasonable.<br> Just a few more days, Alex,<br> before you turn him over.<br> Just a few more days, and then<br> if I can't do anything,<br> if we both can't,<br> then you can call the police.<br> You're not hiding a criminal.<br> There's no evidence against him<br> except his own guilt fantasies.<br> He's wanted only<br> as a possible witness<br> as to what happened to Dr. Edwardes.<br> But in his present condition,<br> he could tell the police nothing.<br> Don't you see you're doing nothing<br> against the law?<br> We are helping them<br> by investigating the patient as doctors.<br> Doctors who want the truth<br> even more than they do.<br> All right.<br> - You'll wait?<br> - Go make me coffee.<br> I'll pretend to myself<br> I'm acting sensible for a few days.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'll make you coffee, with an egg.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm Dr. Brulov.<br> Brulov? Yeah, that's right.<br> Bromides. Who's been feeding me bromides?<br> I gave you, to sleep.<br> Brulov.<br> Oh, yes. Rochester.<br> What's your name?<br> I don't know.<br> - Constance told you.<br> - Nobody told me.<br> If I don't know a patient with amnesia<br> when I see one, what do I know?<br> You don't remember your father or mother?<br> No.<br> - Wife or sweetheart?<br> - No.<br> Don't fight me.<br> I'm going to help you, if I can.<br> I'm going to be your father image.<br> I want you to look on me<br> like your father.<br> Trust me, lean on me.<br> It's a shortcut, but we haven't much time.<br> All right. Go ahead, I'm leaning.<br> Maybe you've got something<br> you want to tell me,<br> a single thought,<br> a few words in the corner of your head.<br> Go on, talk to me.<br> Whatever comes into your head,<br> just say what it is.<br> There's nothing.<br> Maybe you dreamt something?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What did you dream?<br> I don't believe in dreams.<br> That Freud stuff's a lot of hooey.<br> You are a fine one to talk.<br> You've got amnesia,<br> and you've got a guilt complex.<br> You don't know if you are<br> coming or going from someplace,<br> but Freud is hooey.<br> This you know.<br> A wise guy.<br> You don't like me, Papa.<br> Do you want I should help you or not?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'll explain to you about dreams,<br> so you don't think it is hooey.<br> The secrets of who you are<br> and what has made you run away from yourself,<br> all these secrets are buried in your brain.<br> But you don't want to look at them.<br> The human being very often doesn't want<br> to know the truth about himself,<br> because he thinks it will make him sick.<br> So he makes himself sicker<br> trying to forget.<br> - You follow this?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Coffee.<br> Awful.<br> The patient is going to tell us<br> what he dreamt.<br> Fine, I'll take notes.<br> I'll get my glasses.<br> Now here's where dreams come in.<br> They tell you what you are trying to hide.<br> But they tell it to you all mixed up,<br> like pieces of a puzzle that don't fit.<br> The problem of the analyst<br> is to examine this puzzle<br> and put the pieces together<br> in the right place.<br> And find out what the devil<br> you are trying to say to yourself.<br> Let's see.<br> I kept thinking while I was dreaming<br> that all this meant something,<br> that there was some other meaning in it<br> that I ought to find out.<br> We'll find out.<br> I can't make out just what sort<br> of a place it was.<br> It seemed to be a gambling house.<br> But there weren't any walls,<br> just a lot of curtains<br> with eyes painted on them.<br> A man was walking around<br> with a large pair of scissors<br> cutting all the drapes in half.<br> And then a girl came in<br> with hardly anything on<br> and started walking around the gambling room<br> kissing everybody.<br> She came to my table first.<br> Did you recognize this kissing bug?<br> I'm afraid she looked<br> a little like Constance.<br> This is plain, ordinary,<br> wishful dreaming.<br> Go on.<br> I was sitting there playing cards<br> with a man who had a beard.<br> I was dealing to him.<br> I turned up a seven of clubs.<br> He said, "That makes 21. I win."<br> But when he turned up his cards,<br> they were blank.<br> Just then, the proprietor came in<br> and accused him of cheating.<br> The proprietor yelled "This is my place.<br> If I catch you again, I'll fix you."<br> I'm sorry about that kissing bug.<br> I'm glad you didn't dream of me as an eggbeater,<br> as one of my patients did.<br> Why? What would that mean?<br> Never mind.<br> Does it make any sense to you,<br> what I've dreamed?<br> Not yet. You're trying<br> to tell yourself something.<br> What it is, we'll figure out later.<br> There's a lot more to it.<br> Go on and try to recall the details.<br> The more cockeyed,<br> the better for the scientific side of it.<br> It was, leaning over the sloping roof<br> of a high building<br> was the man with the beard.<br> I yelled at him to watch out.<br> Then he went over slowly,<br> with his feet in the air.<br> And then I saw the proprietor again,<br> the man in the mask.<br> He was hiding behind a tall chimney<br> and he had a small wheel in his hand.<br> I saw him drop the wheel on the roof.<br> Suddenly I was running.<br> Then I heard something<br> beating over my head.<br> It was a great pair of wings.<br> The wings chased me<br> and almost caught up with me<br> when I came to the bottom of the hill.<br> I must have escaped.<br> I don't remember.<br> That's all there was.<br> I woke up and saw Dr. Brulov.<br> - Have some coffee.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Something's happening there.<br> - What is it?<br> - Snow.<br> - The light frightened him.<br> Photophobia.<br> No. It was the snow.<br> That's the white he's afraid of.<br> Snow and those tracks.<br> - What tracks?<br> - The sled tracks in the snow.<br> The first symptom he revealed<br> was shock at the sight of fork lines<br> drawn on a white tablecloth.<br> And my robe, which had dark lines on it.<br> And last night, the white coverlet,<br> like those dark tracks in the snow.<br> We'll pull the blinds down.<br> Dr. Edwardes was fond of sports.<br> He mentions tennis and skiing<br> in his book as valuable<br> in the treatment of mental disorders.<br> Skiing.<br> Ski tracks in the snow.<br> That's what those dark lines<br> symbolize for him.<br> His horror of them means, of course,<br> that they are immediately connected<br> with the cause of his amnesia.<br> Yes. A murder on skis.<br> Where did Edwardes go for his skiing?<br> We must find out.<br> Can you tell us where? Try.<br> He has told us already in his dream.<br> Let me see your notes.<br> What can we do for him?<br> You're not his mama, you're an analyst.<br> Leave him alone.<br> He'll come out of this by himself.<br> The sloping roof.<br> - That means only mountainside.<br> - They were skiing.<br> The father image, the bearded man,<br> is Dr. Edwardes.<br> That's very simple.<br> Dr. Edwardes plunged over the precipice while skiing.<br> And then a shadow chases him<br> up and down a hill.<br> That could mean he was escaping from a valley.<br> Skiing resorts are often called valleys.<br> Like Sun Valley.<br> He was being pursued by a winged figure,<br> a witch or a harpy.<br> No. The figure was you.<br> If you grew wings,<br> you would be an angel.<br> The dream's trying to tell him<br> the name of the resort.<br> Angel. Angel Valley.<br> Do you remember Angel Valley?<br> No.<br> We can call a travel agency<br> and check all the resort names.<br> It wasn't Angel Valley.<br> I remember it.<br> It was a place called Gabriel Valley.<br> What else do you remember now?<br> Who was the masked figure in your dream?<br> It was an accident.<br> Do you remember that, a skiing accident?<br> Dr. Edwardes went over a snow cliff.<br> It was no accident! I can't stand this anymore.<br> I've had enough of it.<br> We've got to call the police.<br> No. We have to go to Gabriel Valley.<br> You've got to go with me.<br> - This is for Cooley when he comes in.<br> - I'll tell him.<br> At 4:45? Thank you. Goodbye.<br> There's a train leaving in an hour.<br> We can make connections for Gabriel Valley.<br> I know what I have to do.<br> I can't go on endangering you.<br> - I know about last night.<br> - Nothing happened.<br> But it will.<br> I've got to end it before it does.<br> I love you, but I'm not worth loving.<br> - Darling, you can help me afterward.<br> - There's no help afterward.<br> If you give yourself up to the police<br> in your condition,<br> there's no afterwards for either of us.<br> I can cure you.<br> - But you can't undo a murder.<br> - There is none to undo.<br> - I killed him.<br> - Stop it.<br> And now, you... Last night...<br> Don't try to stop me, I've got to go.<br> Guilt, guilt, you've lived with it<br> for a long time, haven't you?<br> Yes.<br> - Since childhood.<br> - What?<br> Ever since your childhood,<br> you've tried to run away from something.<br> You've always felt guilty<br> about everything that happened around you.<br> What was it in your youth?<br> It must have been terrible for you<br> to prefer to think you murdered Edwardes<br> rather than remember what happened long ago.<br> You said you love me. Look at me.<br> Then, why am I fighting for you?<br> - Because I love you. Because I need you.<br> - But I'm nothing.<br> I want you to come with me<br> to Gabriel Valley.<br> What good will that do?<br> When you see the hill where the accident happened,<br> you'll remember it.<br> We'll go skiing together<br> as you did with Edwardes.<br> I was there, I killed him.<br> You'll see your innocence,<br> you'll see what really happened.<br> - You mean, because it will happen again?<br> - Yes.<br> And what if I killed him?<br> Isn't it true that<br> if the episode's repeated,<br> I'm likely to do<br> the same thing I did before?<br> Then how do you know I won't kill again?<br> Because I'm convinced<br> you didn't kill in the first place.<br> You believe in me enough<br> to take such a chance?<br> Of course I do.<br> We're going back to that ski run.<br> We'll find out what it was<br> in your childhood<br> that's haunted you all your life.<br> We'll also find out what happened<br> to Dr. Edwardes.<br> Did you ever see her before?<br> Let's go.<br> I've always loved very feminine clothes,<br> but never quite dared to wear them.<br> But I'm going to after this,<br> I'm going to wear exactly the things<br> that please me.<br> And you.<br> Even very funny hats.<br> You know, the kind that makes you look<br> a little drunk?<br> Put them on.<br> It was something in my childhood.<br> Something in my childhood.<br> I remember now. I killed my brother.<br> I didn't kill my brother.<br> It was an accident. It was an accident!<br> That's what's haunted you all your life.<br> That was the memory you were afraid of.<br> It's like looking into a picture book,<br> an old one,<br> seeing the familiar pictures one at a time.<br> I went to Columbia Medical School,<br> met a girl with a giggle,<br> who luckily married my roommate, Ken.<br> Oh, and by the way,<br> my name's John Ballyntine.<br> I'm very pleased to meet you.<br> Another thing, my Army record's all right.<br> I was invalided out.<br> I ran into Dr. Edwardes<br> when I was in the Cumberland Mountains,<br> trying to recover from some kind<br> of nerve shock I got<br> when the plane crashed.<br> He was on vacation<br> but I asked him to help me,<br> and he invited me to go skiing with him.<br> We went through New York.<br> I seem to remember<br> going to lunch somewhere.<br> It's still a little vague about that luncheon part.<br> Then we arrived here,<br> and the accident happened at that spot.<br> Where you saved me.<br> Now, let's not have any confusion<br> about who saved whom.<br> Yes, he went over there, all right.<br> It's still a little foggy.<br> But I do know that Edwardes<br> was about 50 feet ahead of me<br> when he went over. I saw him plunge.<br> That was the thing that set you off.<br> That stirred up your old guilt complex<br> and made you think that you'd killed him.<br> Then you had to run away from that, too.<br> Then you took on the role of Dr. Edwardes<br> to prove to yourself he wasn't dead,<br> so therefore, you had not killed him.<br> Professor, I never quite realized<br> in my amnesic state how lovely you are.<br> Now that you got your head back,<br> you mustn't lose it again.<br> It's too late. I'm beyond cure.<br> How does it feel to be a great analyst?<br> Not so bad.<br> - And a great detective?<br> - Wonderful.<br> And madly adored?<br> Very wonderful.<br> You'll look wonderful in white<br> with a little orange blossom in your hair.<br> That sounds vaguely as if<br> it had something to do with marriage.<br> That's a brilliant analysis, Doctor.<br> Hello.<br> You know Lieutenant Cooley<br> and Sergeant Gillespie from Rochester?<br> Yes, yes, we know them quite well.<br> How did you find us?<br> With no thanks to your friend,<br> Dr. Brulov.<br> We made a few inquiries at the railroad station.<br> You left a trail a mile wide.<br> You arrived just in the nick of time.<br> I believe that's the usual expression.<br> We found the body of Dr. Edwardes.<br> It's almost exactly where you told<br> the local police it would be.<br> - You remember the spot very well.<br> - Thank goodness it's all cleared up.<br> Not quite, Dr. Petersen.<br> I'm afraid a bullet was found in the body.<br> That's impossible.<br> - It was in his back.<br> - The case is one of murder.<br> We shall have to detain you, sir.<br> It's my duty to inform you that anything you say<br> may be used against you.<br> No.<br> You mustn't say you killed him.<br> Try to remember what happened<br> before Edwardes went over.<br> But when he said he killed him,<br> he wasn't himself.<br> He was in a state of great mental distress.<br> You can't put him away. You can't!<br> It'll destroy his mind.<br> Don't you understand?<br> Goodbye, my dear.<br> We won't give up hope.<br> I'm going to fight and fight and get you free.<br> My dear girl,<br> you cannot keep bumping your head<br> against reality<br> and saying it is not there.<br> The evidence was definite.<br> We can't remove it by wishing or crying.<br> He trusted me.<br> I led him into a trap.<br> I convicted him.<br> Is that real enough for you?<br> There is no one to blame.<br> The case was a little deeper<br> than you figured.<br> This often happens.<br> You must realize now one thing.<br> It is over for both of you.<br> It's not over.<br> - You will have other cases.<br> - It's not over. It never will be.<br> Don't ask me to stop, I can't. I can't.<br> Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I...<br> Thanks for straightening things out<br> with Dr. Murchison<br> and everyone.<br> It is very sad<br> to love and lose somebody.<br> But in a while, you'll forget,<br> and you will take up the threads<br> of your life<br> where you left off not so long ago<br> and you will work hard.<br> There's lots of happiness in working hard.<br> Maybe the most.<br> I will write to you.<br> Oh, Alex.<br> You're very good.<br> I'm sorry to hurry you, Dr. Brulov,<br> but your car is waiting.<br> - You have just time.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm always late, always forgetting.<br> A brilliant man.<br> I should have gone to the station with him.<br> You're too tired.<br> I know that feeling of exhaustion<br> only too well.<br> One must humor it, or it explodes.<br> I shall try to help you in every way.<br> - You will take care of yourself?<br> - Yes.<br> And try to forget things better forgotten.<br> You've got a great career<br> ahead of you, Constance.<br> Thank you. Well, at least<br> one good thing came out of all this.<br> You are back at Green Manors.<br> Who knows what would have happened<br> to the place under Dr. Edwardes?<br> I knew Edwardes only slightly.<br> I never really liked him.<br> But he was a good man,<br> in a way, I suppose.<br> Well, good night, Constance.<br> I hope you feel rested in the morning.<br> I knew Edwardes only slightly.<br> I never liked him very well.<br> I knew Edwardes only slightly.<br> Knew Edwardes slightly.<br> Knew Edwardes.<br> Knew Edwardes slightly.<br> Knew Edwardes.<br> Knew.<br> Knew.<br> Knew.<br> Come in.<br> I want to talk to you, Dr. Murchison.<br> It's rather late, and you need rest, Constance.<br> I must talk to you.<br> Nocturnal confidences are bad for the nerves.<br> - Is it something about your work?<br> - Yes.<br> - Can't it wait till morning?<br> - It can't wait.<br> Do sit down.<br> Now, what's your problem?<br> It is a dream one of my patients reported.<br> May I ask who the patient is?<br> The patient is John Ballyntine.<br> I fancied that.<br> You're still working on<br> the possibility of his innocence.<br> Charming loyalty.<br> One of your most<br> attractive characteristics, Constance.<br> What did he dream?<br> He dreamt he was in a gambling house,<br> it was full of odd people<br> playing with blank cards.<br> Blank cards.<br> Obviously the patient was trying to deny<br> it was a gambling house<br> by dreaming of spurious cards.<br> One of the people in the place went around<br> cutting the drapes in half.<br> Another was a scantily dressed girl<br> who was kissing everybody.<br> With a little effort, one could almost imagine<br> the inmates of Green Manors.<br> That's what I had in mind,<br> Dr. Murchison.<br> Interesting notion to play around with, isn't it?<br> Do go on.<br> There were eyes painted on the curtains<br> around the walls.<br> Oh.<br> The guards at Green Manors.<br> The patient was playing cards,<br> now no longer blank.<br> A game of twenty-one with a bearded man<br> who was evidently Dr. Edwardes.<br> Yes, one usually dreams of one's analyst<br> as authority with a beard.<br> He dealt Edwardes the seven of clubs,<br> and Edwardes said,<br> "That makes it 21."<br> I would say the patient<br> was trying to mention a locale.<br> The seven of clubs might mean a club.<br> Yes, with the word "twenty-one" in it.<br> There is such a place in New York.<br> It's called the 21 Club.<br> I've heard of it.<br> The patient dreamt<br> the proprietor of the place came in<br> and began accusing Dr. Edwardes of cheating.<br> He ordered Edwardes out and said,<br> "I won't allow you to play here.<br> This is my place.<br> I'm going to fix you."<br> The dream gives the locale<br> a double identity.<br> The 21 Club and Green Manors.<br> The proprietor seems to belong<br> more to the latter.<br> In fact...<br> I would say that this angry proprietor<br> who threatened Dr. Edwardes...<br> was myself.<br> It seemed that way to me.<br> I presume you only arrived<br> at this solution tonight?<br> Yes.<br> And have confided your<br> psychoanalytic findings to nobody?<br> Not yet.<br> Was there any more to the dream?<br> Yes.<br> The patient dreamt he and Dr. Edwardes<br> were on a high sloping roof,<br> and that he saw Edwardes<br> plunge over the edge to his death.<br> He also saw the angry proprietor<br> hiding behind the chimney laughing,<br> holding a small wheel in his hand.<br> He dropped the wheel.<br> The symbolism of the small wheel<br> escapes me.<br> It was a revolver.<br> The proprietor who threatened Edwardes' life<br> in the 21 Club<br> dropped a revolver in the snow<br> in Gabriel Valley<br> after shooting Dr. Edwardes in the back.<br> The weapon is still there<br> at the foot of a tree<br> with the murderer's fingerprints on it.<br> I can't agree with this part<br> of your interpretation,<br> for the good reason that the weapon<br> is now in my hand.<br> I imagined something<br> of this sort would happen<br> when I made the slip tonight<br> about knowing Edwardes.<br> That started your agile,<br> young mind going.<br> You were having a breakdown.<br> In a state of panic, you heard<br> that Edwardes was to take your place here.<br> So you sought him out<br> in his favorite restaurant,<br> where he was lunching<br> with John Ballyntine.<br> You accused him of stealing your job.<br> You threatened to kill him.<br> He calmed you down, told you<br> he was off on a skiing vacation.<br> You followed him there<br> and shot him from behind a tree.<br> That's enough. Your story is ridiculous.<br> You'll make a fool of yourself.<br> A love-smitten analyst<br> playing a dream detective.<br> There'll be no dreams for the police.<br> They'll find out from the waiters<br> in the 21 Club that you were there.<br> You'll be identified as the man<br> who had a row with Dr. Edwardes.<br> There will be people who saw you<br> on the train to Gabriel Valley,<br> who saw you there.<br> There will be no dreams<br> necessary for this case.<br> I see.<br> You're an excellent analyst, Dr. Petersen,<br> but a rather stupid woman.<br> What did you think I'd do<br> when you told me all this? Congratulate you?<br> You forget in your imbecilic devotion<br> to your patient<br> that the punishment for two murders<br> is the same as for one.<br> You're not going to commit<br> a second murder, Dr. Murchison.<br> I hadn't planned to, but you're here.<br> You're not leaving.<br> A man with your intelligence<br> does not commit a stupid murder.<br> You're thinking you were not<br> mentally responsible<br> for that other crime in the snow.<br> They'll find extenuating circumstances<br> in the state of your health.<br> They'll not execute you<br> for the death of Dr. Edwardes.<br> You can still live, read, write, research,<br> even if you are put away.<br> You're thinking that now, Dr. Murchison.<br> If you shoot now,<br> it is cold, deliberate murder.<br> You'll be tried as a sane murderer,<br> convicted as a sane man,<br> and killed in the electric chair<br> for your crime.<br> I'm going to telephone the police now,<br> Dr. Murchison.<br> And remember what I say.<br> Any husband of Constance<br> is a husband of mine, so to speak.<br> All right.<br> - Goodbye. Good luck.<br> - Goodbye.<br>
