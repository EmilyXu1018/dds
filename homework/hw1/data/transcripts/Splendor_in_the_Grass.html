Please.<br> Deanie, cut it out.<br> Now, Bud.<br> Deanie, you're a nice girl.<br> I'm not.<br> I'm not a nice girl.<br> Come on, cut it out.<br> I just can't go on like this anymore.<br> Now come on, we're gonna go back inside.<br> No, I don't want to go back inside.<br> I want to stay here with you. I want you!.<br> -This isn't the way it should be.<br> -Why not?<br> -Why not? Why don't you want it?<br> -You're not yourself.<br> Deanie, where's your pride?<br> My pride? My pride?<br> -I don't care about my pride!<br> -Deanie, stop it!<br> Stop it, Deanie! Deanie, stop!<br> Go on, go on!. I haven't any pride!<br> I haven't any pride!<br> Oh, God! What am I gonna do with you?<br> I don't care what you do.<br> I don't care what happens!<br> I haven't any pride!<br> I just want to die! I just want to die!<br> Take me away from here. Take me away.<br> It's okay. Come on.<br> I put some bread on to set.<br> We'll have homemade bread for a few days.<br> What are you thinking about, Del?<br> I'm worrying about our little girl.<br> She's all right now.

Come here!.<br> What's the matter with you? Come here!.<br> She dove in. What's wrong with that girl?<br> Get away! Leave me alone!.<br> She hasn't spoken a word of sense<br> since they brought her in here.<br> Stay close to her.<br> -Any word?<br> -No, not yet.<br> Not yet.<br> Not yet.<br> My baby. Why did she do it?<br> I don't want to see you ever again.<br> Mama, quit talking like that.<br> I don't care. He's the cause<br> of all her trouble.<br> He's the cause.<br> -What did you do to her tonight?<br> -No, Mama!<br> I want him to answer me.<br> She doesn't mean what she says.<br> I do, too.<br> My little girl. I want my little girl.<br> Mama, quit getting all worked up.<br> How can I help getting worked up...<br> ...when my baby, my baby lies there<br> fighting for her life?<br> Frieda, I'm sorry.<br> By george, Del,<br> I'm sorry to hear about this.<br> -Is she all right?<br> -They don't know what's the matter yet.<br> Your daughter is<br> in a very nervous condition.<br> -Can I see my baby?<br> -No, not now. Perhaps tomorrow.<br> Have you thought about<br> what I suggested to you?<br> Yes. I'm going through with it.<br> I'll sell those stocks and send her off<br> to Wichita as soon as she's ready to leave.<br> Good. I'll make the arrangements for you.<br> It's time you and I were home in bed.<br> I'm gonna marry Deanie.<br> I don't care what he says, Doc.<br> -Good night, Bud.<br> -Good night, Mr. Loomis.<br> I'm of legal age. I don't care what he says,<br> I'm gonna marry her.<br> Bud, do you want to help Deanie?<br> Then stay away from her.<br> -For how long?<br> -I don't know.<br> I don't know now. No one does.<br> Who's that?<br> Who's there? Who's there?<br> There's nobody. Nobody.<br> There was somebody here.<br> Somebody was here.<br> Somebody was here.<br> You have another letter from your father.<br> I'm beginning to think you want<br> to be thrown out of school.<br> Angelina, do you think I could have...<br> ...another one of these home brew?<br> Mister, you drink! You're gonna get sick.<br> Let me bring you some food.<br> Would you like something to eat?<br> My mother's making some pizza.<br> Would you like some pizza?<br> What is pizza?<br> You don't know what pizza is?<br> Where are you from?<br> From Kansas.<br> Where is that?<br> It's right in the middle of the USA.<br> So that's where your home is.<br> Is it nice out there in Kansas?<br> Yep.<br> It's very friendly.<br> That's what it's like, it's friendly.<br> Everybody knows your name<br> and they know who you are and....<br> Why don't you go back?<br> You must have a sweetheart out there.<br> I did.<br> Come in the kitchen with me.<br> Mama will give you some pizza.<br> Have some pizza.<br> Come on.<br> That's fine, you're up.<br> You all right?<br> What?<br> Are you all right, mister?<br> Sure you are.<br> Sit on that bench.<br> I'll be right with you. All right?<br> No, that's for Mr. Mangialomino.<br> What do you think about that?<br> Squint your eyes a bit.<br> What would Czanne say to that?<br> That's swell, Deanie.<br> I never thought I could do this well, really.<br> It looks better with one eye closed.<br> Oh, you!.<br> I like metalwork, though. You can<br> get rid of a lot of hostilities this way.<br> Watch.<br> Every time I pound,<br> I tell myself it's my old man.<br> My old man had his heart set on<br> my being a surgeon.<br> Well, not just a surgeon<br> but the greatest surgeon who ever lived.<br> So, anyway, I couldn't make that first cut.<br> That first cut into the flesh<br> of another man's body.<br> I shook. I couldn't keep my hands steady.<br> You can still be an M.D.<br> when you get out, though.<br> If I ever get out.<br> Johnny, don't talk like that.<br> I'm kidding, I hope.<br> Deanie, your parents are<br> in the waiting room.<br> Mother and Dad are here?<br> My folks are here. I haven't seen them<br> for six months. Not since I've been here.<br> I hope these people know<br> what they're doing.<br> How much longer are they going<br> to keep her here?<br> Here she comes.<br> Don't let Deanie see you looking this way.<br> -My baby!. My little baby!.<br> -Hi, Mother. It's good to see you.<br> Daddy!. It's so good to see you.<br> Doesn't she look just fine, Del?<br> They can't tell me there's anything wrong<br> with my little baby.<br> She's just as sound and normal<br> as the next one--<br> I brought our little girl a box of candy.<br> Thank you, Daddy.<br> All the girls in your old gang<br> wanted to tell you hello.<br> Your father had to go<br> and tell everyone where you are.<br> I'm not ashamed, Mom.<br> Sit down.<br> Well, now lets see.<br> Kay's gone off to Miss Finch's school.<br> Very elegant.<br> Her folks are very wealthy now, you know.<br> And June. June calls about you<br> every week or so.<br> -I guess you know she married Bob.<br> -Yes.<br> Carolyn and June are off at the university.<br> Now Carolyn pledged Pi Phi.<br> Hazel pledged Kappa. Which is better?<br> -I don't know.<br> -The university isn't far from here.<br> Maybe you'd like them to come<br> and see you some Saturday.<br> I don't think so, Mom.<br> No, no, I guess not.<br> I guess it wouldn't be...suitable.<br> There's nothing the matter with you,<br> you just remember that.<br> You are perfectly all right.<br> Just as well off as Kay or June or Hazel<br> or any of those girls.<br> Maybe....<br> Deanie, would you like to have dinner<br> with us tonight down at the hotel?<br> Deanie's had a very trying day,<br> she's too tired.<br> Yes, I'm awfully....<br> We're not gonna see any more of you?<br> This is all we get to see of you?<br> Mom, I'm sorry.<br> We drove all the way up here<br> just to be with our baby.<br> Now they tell us we can't be<br> with her tonight.<br> You want what's best for your daughter,<br> don't you, Mrs. Loomis?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I want what's best for my daughter.<br> We'll take our little girl out to dinner...<br> I'm sorry.<br> ...the next time we come up, Mama.<br> Mom kept calling me her baby...<br> ...and Dad kept calling me his little girl.<br> Dr. Judd, don't they realize I'm me?<br> You're the one that's got to change.<br> They can't.<br> I don't think I could ever go<br> back home again.<br> I don't think I can feel the same way<br> I used to feel about them.<br> You'll just have to accept them as people,<br> with a lot of faults maybe...<br> ...but not as Mama and Papa.<br> As people?<br> You know, we blame our parents<br> for everything these days.<br> You've gotta remember<br> they had parents, too.<br> I suppose.<br> You had a mama and a papa, too?<br> Oh, yes, most assuredly.<br> That'll be all, Deanie. You can go now.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Have you heard from that young man?<br> What was his name?<br> Bud?<br> No.<br> No, we've given up writing.<br> I guess he's probably away at school.<br> I don't know. No one ever writes me<br> anything about him.<br> I guess they're afraid it would upset me.<br> Would it?<br> Maybe you'll feel a little stronger<br> about it in time.<br> I hope so.<br> I'll bet they've been practicing<br> some of that Freud on her.<br> I've read about him.<br> All he's concerned about is sex.<br> And it's costing us every blessed penny<br> we made on our stocks.<br> If we could've held onto those stocks,<br> we would've made a fortune.<br> I don't think it's very polite of you to turn<br> on the radio when I'm talking to you.<br> Stock prices crashed today...<br> ...in the most disastrous trading ever<br> on the New York Stock Exchange.<br> $14 billion was lost<br> in the nation-wide attempt to unload.<br> Sell out? What do you mean, sell out?<br> You're getting panicky like everybody else.<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Now just don't get panicky, Jack.<br> Don't lose your courage.<br> Come in.<br> Hang on, Jack, just hang on.<br> Just hang in there.<br> No, I can't go on with this right now, Jack.<br> Sit down, friend, I'll be right with you.<br> I'm in New Haven.<br> My kid's in school up here.<br> Oh, hell, he's doing just fine.<br> Flunking every course, but otherwise fine.<br> He'll be all right.<br> I got an idea what's wrong with him.<br> Yeah, I'll be calling you.<br> -What'd you find out?<br> -You were right.<br> -Who is she?<br> -She's a waitress.<br> Waitress?<br> In a pizza place. It's all right here.<br> Do you want a drink?<br> Bud, suppose you tell us--<br> He hasn't been applying himself.<br> I know my boy.<br> He could pass any course you offer here.<br> Flying colors, straight A's.<br> Thank you.<br> Suppose you tell us<br> what you think is the matter, Bud.<br> Have you really been interested<br> in your work here at Yale?<br> What difference does that make?<br> I sent you here to graduate.<br> I'm sorry to disappoint you, Dad, but--<br> Now why don't we just talk turkey, Son?<br> Tell us what's been on your mind.<br> What's been eating your time and energy?<br> A long-distance call from New York<br> for Mr. Stamper.<br> -Where can I take it?<br> -Urgent. Right this way, sir.<br> Is there anything you'd rather<br> be doing now than going to school here?<br> To tell you the truth, Dean Pollard,<br> I never wanted to do a thing but ranch.<br> But, Dad....<br> I've never had the belief<br> that everybody should go to college.<br> Well, maybe you could talk to him.<br> He isn't a very good listener really, is he?<br> I gotta get back to New York right away.<br> Bud, suppose you let me talk<br> to your father.<br> Yeah, sure. Thank you.<br> I'll see you back in your room, Son.<br> Dean Pollard, what's the matter<br> with people?<br> What do you mean?<br> The whole town of New York<br> is jumping out of windows.<br> I mean, they're quitting.<br> And things are gonna get back to normal<br> in a couple of days.<br> -You really think so?<br> -I know so! I know so!.<br> They've got to!. They've got to!.<br> Now, about the boy....<br> I'm gonna take him to New York with me.<br> I'll have him back here Monday morning<br> ready to settle down and go to work.<br> I must say, Mr. Stamper, I do not feel<br> that the boy should remain in school here.<br> Please don't give up on him.<br> Don't give up on him, Dean Pollard.<br> I had to go through something like this<br> with him once before.<br> He falls for some little girl<br> and then that's all he can think about.<br> -I don't think that's it, Mr. Stamper.<br> -I think that's it! I think that's it!<br> I think I've known him a little bit longer<br> and a little bit better than you have!<br> I had to break something like this before!<br> I'll break it up again!<br> I'll have him Monday morning<br> ready to go to work!<br> Kewpie dolls.<br> Kewpie dolls.<br> Would you like a Kewpie doll<br> for your cutie-pie?<br> -Yeah. How much are they?<br> -$50.<br> All right, you fish $50 out of there<br> and you give me the rest back.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> 'Bye.<br> 'Bye.<br> They all look the same in this town.<br> The newlyweds. Stand up.<br> Give the little girl a hand.<br> Hello, suckers.<br> I think I smell fresh money tonight.<br> I'm glad the stock market crash<br> didn't keep you from coming out tonight.<br> Tonight as I was walking<br> down Park Avenue to get a taxi...<br> ...I had to dodge the bodies<br> jumping out of the windows.<br> But let's not be morbid.<br> -Same all around?<br> -No, no more for me.<br> Same all around.<br> Lay one on me. Lay one on.<br> Doggone.<br> Dad, let's go.<br> Wait, Bud, wait a minute.<br> The point I'm trying to make, Bud....<br> I never have been able to make<br> this one point with you, Son.<br> Bud, listen....<br> I may not be around<br> too much longer and....<br> What are you talking about?<br> Wait now. Don't act so worried.<br> I got no intention of kicking off for a while.<br> What are you leading up to?<br> It may be that I haven't always done<br> the right thing by you, boy...<br> ...and I'm sorry.<br> There may be things<br> I might have taken away.<br> I'd like to make it up to you.<br> Forget it, Dad.<br> Look up there.<br> Look up there on that stage.<br> Deanie.<br> Yeah, she does look a little like Deanie.<br> Little, hell! Hell, a little!. Exactly!<br> Same damn thing! Exactly!<br> Same damn thing! Just as pretty!<br> Just as pretty!<br> You never been fair to me on that.<br> I did that for your own good.<br> How'd you like to be married to her now?<br> Did you ever think about that?<br> Ever think of how you'd like to be married<br> to Deanie with her in that institute?<br> Did you ever think about it?<br> How'd you like that?<br> How'd you like that?<br> Her in that institution?<br> What the hell difference does it make?<br> That's the same thing!<br> That's the same thing exactly!<br> And just as pretty!. Just as pretty!<br> You look up there, just as pretty!<br> You want that? Do you want it, Son?<br> Son, you want it, you can have it!.<br> You can have it, boy. I'll get it for you.<br> You can have anything you want.<br> Anything you want, boy!<br> This world is your oyster!<br> You sit here, I'll show you.<br> You sit there, I'll show you.<br> You sit there, I'll show you.<br> Yeah?<br> Are you Bud?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Aren't you gonna invite me in?<br> I'm sorry, but...<br> ...I think you must've got the wrong room.<br> Mr. Stamper?<br> Mr. Stamper!.<br> That's him.<br> What do you want to do with...?<br> I'll take him home.<br> I'll be home in a few hours.<br> The first time in....<br> Two years and six months<br> almost to the day.<br> How do you feel about going home?<br> Like going to a foreign country.<br> John has asked me to marry him.<br> You waited until now to tell me?<br> Well.<br> Are you going to accept?<br> I don't know.<br> Do you love John?<br> I think so.<br> It's different from the way<br> that I felt about...<br> ...Bud.<br> But, l...<br> ...I love him.<br> Well, I see no reason why both of you<br> shouldn't have a very happy future.<br> John's back in Cincinnati now,<br> practicing medicine, doing very well.<br> I know.<br> I hear from him every day.<br> My taxi.<br> Taxi's here.<br> Will you see Bud when you're home?<br> I don't know.<br> Do you think you'll be happy<br> married to John if...<br> ...you still don't know how you feel<br> about the other young man?<br> When we face these fears<br> they sometimes turn into nothing.<br> All right, Dr. Judd.<br> I'll see him.<br> I'll write to you.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Why couldn't you marry a boy from here?<br> You won't be much company for me,<br> living back East in Cincinnati.<br> What do you know about<br> this young man you're marrying?<br> After all, you met him in a mental hospital.<br> Are you sure he's all right?<br> I was in the hospital, too.<br> Well, with you it was different.<br> You were just run down.<br> That was the only thing<br> the matter with you.<br> Is he a New Dealer?<br> I don't know.<br> I could cry, just cry, when I think<br> I'm going to lose my little girl.<br> How much did this cost?<br> I don't know, Mother.<br> Did those doctors at the hospital...<br> ...say your mother had raised you wrong<br> or something?<br> Did they blame your father...<br> ...and me in any way?<br> I don't blame anyone, Mother.<br> I raised you the only way I knew how.<br> The only way I knew how.<br> The way my mother raised me...<br> ...and I suppose the way<br> her mother raised her.<br> If I brought you up wrong, Deanie,<br> I don't think you should hate me.<br> I know I used to hate my mother at times...<br> ...but I always believed she was right<br> about things. Maybe she wasn't...<br> ...but I loved her.<br> I love you, Mother.<br> I hope so, Deanie.<br> You know it would be nice if children<br> could be born into this world...<br> ...with an absolute guarantee they'd have<br> just the right kind of bringing up...<br> ...and all lead happy, normal lives, but....<br> Well, I guess when we get born<br> we just all have to take our chances.<br> Mom?<br> Is he married?<br> Who?<br> To tell you the truth, Deanie,<br> I don't really know.<br> Don't be afraid of running into him.<br> Maybe he's living with his mother in Tulsa.<br> She joined her folks there<br> after old Ace killed himself.<br> They say she's as poor as a church mouse.<br> And that girl Ginny?<br> Got killed in a car accident.<br> We all knew something like that<br> would happen the way she carried on.<br> Now the Stampers are almost extinct<br> in this town.<br> You know their home's been turned<br> into a funeral parlor?<br> Some of the old gang's here<br> to see you, Deanie.<br> -I can't wait to see her.<br> -It seems simply ages.<br> How is she, Mr. Loomis?<br> She's fine.<br> Come on, come for a ride with us.<br> All right, but give me two minutes<br> to wash the train off.<br> Just one thing:<br> Keep her away from Bud Stamper.<br> Mrs. Loomis, she's forgotten about all that.<br> No, she hasn't. Have some fudge.<br> The very first thing she did<br> was ask about him.<br> And then she laid on the bed<br> and cried and cried.<br> I thought that the years away<br> she'd forget about him but....<br> Now I want you to promise me.<br> The doctors say she's perfectly all right,<br> but there's no use in asking for trouble.<br> Keep her away from him.<br> Well, here's our girl.<br> I want to see Bud now.<br> Now, honey, you just forget about him.<br> I'm not even sure where he is now, Deanie.<br> I mean, no one ever sees him.<br> Do you know where he is, Hazel?<br> He's staying out at his father's old ranch.<br> -It's a long way out there.<br> -I want to go, please.<br> Clear out of there!<br> You want me to go looking for Bud?<br> Oh, Hazel, would you?<br> He's around back.<br> I know.<br> Hi, Bud. Jeepers, you're a mess.<br> Yeah, I've been working.<br> We have 40 head of cattle now.<br> Bud, Deanie's out there in the car.<br> -I hate to see Deanie when I'm so dirty.<br> -She won't mind, Bud.<br> How is she?<br> She seems just fine.<br> Well, I'm glad.<br> Hi, Bud.<br> Long time no see.<br> Long time.<br> It's good to see you.<br> Thanks, Bud.<br> You want to meet my family?<br> Of course.<br> Come on.<br> She didn't even know he was married.<br> You're her best friend.<br> Why didn't you tell her?<br> I just couldn't.<br> Come here, honey,<br> I want you to meet somebody.<br> Hello.<br> Angelina, this is Deanie,<br> an old friend of mine.<br> How do you do?<br> How do you do, Angelina?<br> Would you like to come in?<br> Please.<br> Come in.<br> Hungry?<br> The house, it doesn't look like much.<br> -Maybe I can offer you some wine.<br> -Thank you, but I really can't stay.<br> This is Bud Junior.<br> The one without the feathers.<br> Oh, sure.<br> Hello, Bud Junior. Hello.<br> What a fine boy you are!<br> So now we're expecting another child.<br> I hope it's a girl this time.<br> You're a fine boy.<br> Well, I have to go now.<br> You will come back again sometime?<br> Will you come back for dinner?<br> Thank you, Angelina.<br> I married Angie when I left New Haven.<br> You know I didn't even finish<br> my first year there?<br> She's real nice.<br> She was wonderful to me<br> when things started to go wrong.<br> You're happy, Bud?<br> I guess so.<br> I don't ask myself that question<br> very often now.<br> How about you?<br> I'm getting married next month.<br> Are you, Deanie?<br> A boy from Cincinnati.<br> I think you might like him.<br> Things work out awful funny sometimes,<br> don't they?<br> Yes, they do.<br> Hope you're gonna be awful happy.<br> Like you, Bud, I don't think too much<br> about happiness either.<br> What's the point?<br> You gotta take what comes.<br> Yes.<br> I'm awful glad to see you again.<br> Thanks, Bud.<br> Goodbye.<br> 'Bye.<br> So long, Bud.<br> Hello.<br> -You girls have to come again sometime.<br> -You might ask us.<br> I will. I promise. Angie and I got<br> a little more money coming in now.<br> We'll have a big beer party. She'll call you.<br> -It's a date.<br> -Great.<br> Goodbye.<br> When do we eat?<br> Deanie, honey, do you think<br> you still love him?<br> "Though nothing can bring back the hour<br> Of splendor in the grass...<br> "...of glory in the flower;<br> "We will grieve not, rather find<br> strength in what remains behind".<br>
