                        Based on Actual Events<br> Boston, MA - 1976<br> - How's that going?<br> - Mother's ballin' and<br> the uncle is pissed off.<br> She's not married?<br> Divorced, with 4 kids.<br> I guess the Father<br> was helping out.<br> Helping out?<br> - Hey, Mr. Burke, they're in<br> the back talking to the Bishop.<br> And Father?<br> We put him in the break room.<br> - Any press?<br> Some guy from the Citizen<br> but we sent him away.<br> None of the big papers.<br> Let's keep it that way.<br> Who's that?<br> Assistant D.A.<br> It's gonna be hard to keep<br> the papers from arraignment.<br> What arraignment?<br> - You can tell Father Geoghan<br> it won't be much longer.<br> Now Sheila, you know what<br> I'm going to work...<br> The Church does<br> serve to community...<br> But I give you<br> my personal guaranty...<br> that I'm going to take Father<br> out of the parish....<br> and this will<br> never happen again.<br> We'll just be<br> another moment Paul.<br> Of course Father.<br> Now Sheila, I'm going to give<br> you my personal card.<br> SPOTLIGH - Losing a good reporter...<br> ...is always tough.<br> Boston Globe<br> Offices - July 2001<br> But losing one<br> of our best...<br> Well, to put it this<br> eloquently as I can.<br> It's a real<br> kick in the ass.<br> But, Robby here<br> has known Stewart...<br> ...longer than most<br> of you been alive.<br> So I'll handed off to him.<br> - Robby.<br> Oh, well, thanks Ben.<br> I think.<br> Although I take issue...<br> ...with your reference<br> to my seniority.<br> I will say that Stewart's<br> departure is specially...<br> painful for me, because...<br> For what?<br> Stewart, 20 years now?<br> Stewart's been more<br> than willing ...<br> to part with his money<br> at a poker table.<br> And, I've got<br> a kid in college.<br> Yeah, but I'm<br> gonna keep playing.<br> Oh, problem solved.<br> God speed then.<br> Now Stewart, I find the...<br> timing of your departure...<br> disconcerted.<br> A corner office...<br> sits empty.<br> The new editor<br> arrives on monday.<br> So I'm sorry buddy, but...<br> I got to ask you.<br> What the hell do you know?<br> How's the cake?<br> It's really good.<br> You saving yours?<br> No, that's for Mike.<br> I can't ever eat those things,<br> they are kinda depressing.<br> I know.<br> Did you see the numbers<br> from Washington?<br> Yeah, very interesting.<br> I'm not asking if the PD is<br> lying, I know they're lying.<br> All I'm asking who's behind it?<br> Ok, I get it,<br> you don't wanna talk.<br> No Dan, I'm not mad,<br> I'm hungry.<br> I've been talking to you<br> so long I didn't eat lunch.<br> So I'm gonna get<br> something to eat...<br> and I'll give you<br> an hour to decide...<br> whether you want to be on<br> the right side of this...<br> or read about it<br> like everybody else.<br> Bye Dan.<br> You think Cahill has something?<br> Maybe. I just don't think<br> the story is for us.<br> - Ben likes it?<br> - Yeah, it's not bad.<br> It's just not Spotlight.<br> - What's just not Spotlight?<br> - PD numbers.<br> - The numbers story, feels thin.<br> Oh, you got Cahill to talk?<br> No, but I will.<br> Good, then know if it's thin.<br> How did it go upstairs?<br> Ok, Robby gave a good speech.<br> Sure he did.<br> I heard Lubin and Conor<br> are going to the Times.<br> - C'mon, really?<br> - Yeah, I heard that.<br> They are leaching us.<br> Well, at least they are sending<br> us a guy from Miami to run things.<br> That should help.<br> Has Baron even<br> spent time in Boston?<br> He's never been here before.<br> Maybe we should buy him a map.<br> I have a friend down in Miami,<br> said he cut 15% of the stuff.<br> - Great.<br> - Hey Robby?<br> New boss coming in<br> to make some cuts?<br> I have no idea.<br> Aren't you saying none of them?<br> Yes I am.<br> So is it about spotlight?<br> I don't know Mike.<br> But I do know...<br> That Ben needs an answer on<br> that crime number story.<br> I'm telling you, I really don't<br> think that story is for us.<br> Mr. Baron.<br> Walter Robinson.<br> - Robby.<br> - Thanks for taking<br> a time of your...<br> - Oh, it's my pleasure.<br> - Appreciate it.<br> - What are you reading?<br> - Curse of the Bambino.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Great book.<br> Globe has a season<br> tickets at Fenway...<br> once you settle in,<br> by the way.<br> Thank you.<br> To be honest, I'm, I'm not<br> much of baseball fan...<br> I'm just trying to get<br> the feel for the city.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - So, you're originally from Boston?<br> - I am, born and raised, yeah.<br> A lot of the newsroom<br> is from here.<br> Really feels like ah...<br> like a local paper<br> in that way.<br> And did that<br> changed at all<br> after the paper were<br> sold to the Times?<br> - No. I don't think<br> that big impact.<br> - Good.<br> And... You're an editor<br> for the Spotlight team.<br> I prefer to think of myself...<br> as a player coach, but yes.<br> Are you familiar with the Spotlight?<br> No, not particularly.<br> Well, we are a 4 person<br> investigative team.<br> We report to<br> Ben Bradlee Jr. and...<br> we keep our work confidential.<br> - What are you working on now?<br> We just put out a<br> piece on a shouty...<br> constraction outfit<br> and right now...<br> we're really just trolling<br> around for our next story.<br> - How long does<br> that typically take?<br> - Hard to say,<br> a couple months.<br> - Couple months?<br> Yeah, we don't like to rush it.<br> Once we settle on the project...<br> we can spend a year<br> or more investigating.<br> - Is that a concern?<br> - Not necessarily.<br> But, from what I understand<br> leadership is to how an internet<br> is cutting into<br> the classified business.<br> And, I think I'm gonna need<br> to take a hard look at things.<br> So...<br> You anticipate more cuts?<br> I think it's safe<br> to assume so, but...<br> what I'm more focused<br> on right now is...<br> finding the way to make<br> this paper...<br> essential to its readers.<br> I like to think<br> it already is.<br> Fair enough. I just think<br> that we can do better.<br> - Mr. Bradlee.<br> - Hey.<br> - Saw the PD numbers, looks interesting?<br> - Yeah, there's something there.<br> - How long do you need?<br> - Another week.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - 10.30.<br> Since when?<br> - Technically I am an editor.<br> - Technically.<br> - Your sit down with<br> Baron go that well?<br> - I couldn't get<br> a read on him.<br> That's a first.<br> How about you?<br> Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.<br> Morning everyone.<br> Lets get started.<br> Do you want to say<br> something, Marty?<br> Sure.<br> Hello.<br> As most of you<br> know by now...<br> my name is Marty Baron.<br> I'm... delighted<br> to be here.<br> If you could tell me your<br> name as we go around...<br> that'd be helpful. Thank you.<br> - Ok, Peter.<br> - Peter Canellos, Metro.<br> I've got a major<br> big date closure...<br> - Hey, Steve.<br> - Mike.<br> Hey.<br> - Crappy game last night.<br> - Hm, they can't<br> even worth a nickel.<br> Listen, what's, what's Eileen<br> McNamara doing in 10.30?<br> You need something, Mike?<br> No. Just curious?<br> Go be curious somewhere else.<br> I got work to do.<br> - Ok Steve, see you.<br> - Yeah.<br> And it looks like Pedro is going<br> to be out till september 1st.<br> Jimmy says he could<br> be back this year,<br> but the doctor didn't<br> seem so sure.<br> Where is the pez opener?<br> - Is that everyone?<br> - Yes, that's it.<br> Ok, good, thank you.<br> Did everyone read Eileen<br> McNamara column this weekend?<br> - That's the Geoghan case?<br> - Yeah. What's the follow on that?<br> It's a column, what kind of<br> follow would you thinking?<br> Well, apparently this<br> priest molested kids...<br> in 6 different parishes<br> over the last 30 years.<br> - And the attorney<br> for the victims, Mr. ...<br> - Garabedian.<br> Thanks Eileen. Mr. Garabedian<br> says Cardinal Law...<br> found about it 15 years<br> ago and did nothing.<br> Yeah, I think that attorney<br> is a bit of crank...<br> and the Church<br> dismissed the claim.<br> He said, she said.<br> Whether Mr. Garabedian<br> is a crank or not...<br> he says he has documents<br> to prove that Cardinal knew.<br> And as I understand that those<br> documents are under a seal.<br> Ok, but the fact remains<br> that Boston priest...<br> abused 80 kids.<br> We have a lawyer...<br> who says he can prove<br> Law knew about it...<br> and we written all of...<br> 2 stories in<br> the last 6 months.<br> This strikes me as<br> an essential story...<br> to a local paper,<br> I think that at very least...<br> we have to go through<br> those documents.<br> How would you<br> like to do that?<br> Well, I don't know<br> what the laws are here,<br> but in Florida,<br> we would go to Court.<br> You want to sue the Church?<br> Technically we wouldn't<br> sue the Church...<br> we'd file a motion to lift<br> the seal on those documents.<br> The Church would read<br> that as us suing them.<br> So will everybody else.<br> Good to know.<br> Gutsy call for a first day.<br> That's one word for it.<br> How do you think that's<br> gonna play down front?<br> I think Gilman's<br> gonna shit a brick.<br> - Hey.<br> - Door.<br> How did it go?<br> Well, Baron wants to sue for...<br> the sealed docs in<br> the Geoghan case.<br> Wants to sue the Church?<br> Hey, that's great!<br> We covered Geoghan when<br> the story broke 3 years ago.<br> Baron was still in Miami.<br> Thinking might have been<br> The Times then actually.<br> He wasn't here.<br> So do you think that sue<br> has a chance?<br> - Depend on the Judge.<br> - And what parish he belongs to.<br> Bradlee. Yeah. Ok.<br> Baron wants to talk to us.<br> Us?<br> Ok Jim, thank you.<br> Yes. Ok, thanks.<br> I've set up a meeting for<br> tomorrow with outside counselor.<br> - Jon Albano.<br> - Yeah.<br> Who's the Judge in this case?<br> - Constance Sweeney.<br> - Tough.<br> - Why is that?<br> - Good catholic girl.<br> So...<br> Judging from what<br> I've read, it doesn't seem...<br> like we've done the very thorough<br> investigation in the Geoghan case?<br> Is that right?<br> No. It's not.<br> We looked hard at Geoghan.<br> David Armstrong from Metro...<br> and Michael Polson<br> through Religion.<br> Ok, but... Just so<br> that I understand...<br> beyond our daily coverage,<br> we haven't commited any long<br> term investigative resources...<br> to the question whether or not<br> Cardinal Law knew about this.<br> No, we haven't.<br> - And that's the kind of<br> thing your team would do?<br> - Spotlight? Well yeah,<br> but we're still prospecting ...<br> the Boston PD story<br> I told you about.<br> - Could you set that aside?<br> - We could.<br> Marty, in past Spotlight's<br> had success in large part ...<br> because they picked<br> their own projects.<br> Would you consider<br> picking this one?<br> I don't know if he's<br> writing about you, but...<br> I will let him know you called.<br> Ok, bye.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, how did it go?<br> Ok. Baron wants us to<br> scrub the Geoghan case.<br> - That's great.<br> - Didn't we cover Geoghan?<br> There's a lawyer alleging<br> Cardinal Law knew about it.<br> Mitch Garabedian, right? - Yeah.<br> I covered him at the Court House.<br> Can you get to him?<br> I only interviewed him once,<br> he's kind of a character.<br> I like characters.<br> I'll take him.<br> Good, you take him.<br> Also we should<br> be talking to...<br> the lawyer who<br> repped the victims...<br> in the Porter case, Eric Macleish.<br> - That guy who is always on tv.<br> - The Porter case? Remind me.<br> - Yeah, Father Porter similar story.<br> Molested dozens of kids in<br> Fall River about 10 years ago...<br> So, we're driving to Boston PD?<br> I vote yes.<br> No, we should set that<br> aside for now. Listen.<br> I don't need to<br> tell you guys this...<br> we need to be more<br> discreet than usual.<br> Alright?<br> Everybody's gonna be interested<br> in this. Not just Herald.<br> We can't get Cardinal Law get on<br> this till we know what we have.<br> Good luck with that.<br> So when are you leaving?<br> The bus is picking us up at<br> Church parking lot at 9 o'clock.<br> - We got 40 going.<br> - And is Father Dominic going?<br> No, he says he's unlucky.<br> But luck has nothing<br> to do with it.<br> You know, last time<br> nana won $160.<br> - You gonna tell us?<br> - We don't even know<br> if there's a story yet.<br> Well, club's in Church.<br> There's gonna be a story.<br> Hey Lisa, could you pull all the<br> relative clips on that for me?<br> Yeah.<br> This is for Spotlight?<br> Just drop 'em off when<br> they're ready, thanks.<br> Excuse me, do you know where<br> the publishers office is?<br> Will do it.<br> How are you Marty, settling in?<br> Yeah, I think so.<br> Good. What can I do for you?<br> I'd like to challenge the protective<br> order in the Geoghan case.<br> You want to sue the Catholic Church?<br> We're just filing<br> the motion, but... Yes.<br> - You think it's that important?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Because...<br> Obviously the Church will<br> fight us very hard on this.<br> Which won't go unnoticed<br> by our subscriber base,<br> 53% of them are catholic.<br> I think they'll be interested.<br> Ok.<br> Marty, people will<br> probably contact you...<br> about face to face with Cardinal,<br> it's customary.<br> Yeah, they already have,<br> it's set up for next week.<br> I wouldn't mention this.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Can I help you?<br> Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes<br> from Boston Globe,<br> I'm here to see Mitchell Garabedian.<br> - He's on the call, please have a sit.<br> - Ok.<br> Alright, I'm listening, go ahead.<br> Ok.<br> Bill, where the hell<br> are those papers?<br> I asked you to put<br> them on my desk!<br> The famous Walter Robinson<br> in my conference room.<br> Good to see you again Eric.<br> Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric Macleish.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> Youd don't play golf, do you?<br> - No. - Good. Your colleague<br> here, took some money of me...<br> at the charity event last year.<br> It was a very lucky putt, I...<br> actually had my eyes closed,<br> by the way.<br> So, how can I help you guys?<br> You are familiar with<br> the Geoghan case?<br> Sure, 80 plaintiffs.<br> All of them individual cases,<br> Garabedian must be swimming.<br> Yeah, any allegation<br> against Cardinal Law?<br> Yeah, it's tricky.<br> This is what you need to understand,<br> these are shitty cases.<br> Statute of limitation is only<br> 3 years, and most of these...<br> victims don't come forward<br> till long after that.<br> - Why is that?<br> - Well they're kids, you know?<br> Guilt, shame...<br> And most of these kids<br> come from tough neighbourhood,<br> nobody wants to admit<br> this kind of thing, so...<br> you're screwed on<br> the time moment, and...<br> even if you argue your way around that,<br> the charitable immunity statute...<br> caps damages at 20 grand.<br> 20 grand, for molesting a child?<br> That is the way<br> the system is set up, yes.<br> The Church is tough, so...<br> your best shot is to<br> try this cases in the press.<br> Like I did on Porter.<br> But you know, most of the<br> victims they don't wanna...<br> have anything do to with TV ...<br> and Mitch isn't exactly<br> a people person.<br> Yeah, half Garabedian can kids<br> victims just go before the press...<br> that is really...<br> That's right, and he has<br> a long road ahead of him.<br> My guess is, he doesn't<br> have anything on Law.<br> - What do you think,<br> he's bluffing?<br> - I think he's grandstanding...<br> to cut a better deal.<br> - Seems a bit reckless.<br> - Have you met Mitch Garabedian?<br> I asked you to<br> write me that motion Bill,<br> I didn't ask you to file it.<br> Hey Bill...<br> Hi.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm Mike Rezendes from Boston Globe...<br> I had an appointment with you,<br> about an hour ago.<br> I can't talk to you, I'm busy.<br> Sharon!<br> She went for coffee,<br> she said she'll be right back.<br> I'm not following up<br> on an article.<br> - The one in the Phoenix?<br> - No, in the Globe.<br> - Did you see the one in the Phoenix?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> I thought it was very good,<br> I have a copy here somewhere.<br> It's alright, I'll track it down.<br> I'm actually<br> following up on a column...<br> that Eileen McNamara<br> wrote about your suit.<br> Suits, 84 of them.<br> It's not a class action,<br> you should get your facts straight.<br> No, you're right, I should.<br> So, I'm trying to get<br> some background information...<br> You are not<br> recording this, are you?<br> No, I wouldn't<br> do that without asking.<br> I can't show you<br> the Church documents...<br> if that's what you're after.<br> They're under seal.<br> Yeah, I know that.<br> Did you know that<br> they try to bring me up...<br> before the Massachusetts<br> Board of Bar Overseers 3 times?<br> They are watching me very closely.<br> - The Church?<br> - Yeah, the Church. Yeah.<br> They'd like to get me disbarred,<br> in fact...Put that away.<br> - Put it away.<br> - Sure.<br> I don't want you recording<br> this in any way, shape or form.<br> - Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.<br> - Ok.<br> In fact, I probably<br> shouldn't even be speaking to you.<br> So...<br> Look, Mr. Garabedian,<br> I know there's...<br> things, you cannot tell me, but...<br> I also know there's a story here..<br> and I think it's an important story.<br> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<br> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<br> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore...<br> they're broke,<br> they don't have any power.<br> The Globe does.<br> If we cover the story,<br> everybody will hear about it.<br> The Church thinks<br> in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.<br> Do you think your paper<br> has resources to take that on?<br> Yeah, I do.<br> But if you don't<br> mind me asking... Do you?<br> I can't talk to you right now,<br> Mr. Rezendes. I'm very, very busy.<br> - Sharon.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Can I at least talk to<br> some of the clients?<br> Victims? I'd really like to do that.<br> - call me tomorrow, I got to think about it.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> A FAMILIAR PATTERN<br> Porter faces Mass. court<br> as '87 abuse claim arises<br> - I got more clips from the library.<br> - Leave 'em right there.<br> Are you guys doing<br> a story on the Church?<br> No, we are not doing<br> a story on the Church.<br> Matt. You find anything<br> on this guy Phil Saviano?<br> No. Who is he?<br> He's part of a victims organization.<br> Kurkjian did a story on him<br> right after the Porter case.<br> As of victims organization?<br> Yeah. It's called SNAP.<br> It's Survivors Network<br> of those Abused by Priest.<br> Chrommy acronym.<br> - Want me to track him down?<br> - Yeah, bring him in.<br> How much longer do you need<br> to get through the clips?<br> I mean, a few days,<br> there's a lot.<br> - Lisa is still sending it more.<br> - Ok.<br> Hey guys, I think I got<br> another Priest.<br> Liam Barrett. Molested<br> some kids in Philly,<br> and was moved to Boston, did<br> the same thing and was moved again.<br> Really?<br> That sounds like Geoghan.<br> Is that one of our clips?<br> Yeah, by our Lance Diego written<br> in 1987, must have been back...<br> when he worked on religion.<br> - Was there any follow?<br> - Not much, only show one piece.<br> The Church settled the case.<br> - Don't you know Jim Sullivan?<br> - Yeah. Why?<br> Looks like the Church<br> bought him an ....<br> Jesus. Should be Manning<br> on the ball in field.<br> - Why do you even<br> bother with that thing?<br> - It distracts me from the game.<br> You know what else<br> is good for that?<br> Oh, yeah. Good idea, buy a round.<br> I'll be right back.<br> - Anybody want any food?<br> - A hotdog.<br> - So you guys making any progress?<br> - Absolutely, it's a good story.<br> Why? Because you're another left<br> catholic pissed off at the Church?<br> - We got a lot of good stuff.<br> - Like what?<br> I'm just watching the game. Omerta.<br> - They got another priest, Liam Barrett.<br> - We reported it.<br> I'm just saying, we did.<br> Ok, but this guy<br> was shuffled a lot...<br> from parish to parish<br> every few years ...<br> just like Geoghan and Porter.<br> I think there's a pattern.<br> Sounds thin.<br> What else you got?<br> Sacha's got another guy from<br> a victims organization. Phil Saviano.<br> - From SNAP?<br> O boy, we reported on him too.<br> I thought you were<br> watching a game, Steve.<br> - That guy is pretty paint up, Mike.<br> - We did a couple stories on him.<br> - Guy would not stop writing letters.<br> - He wants a holy war.<br> - So, he's not worth talking to?<br> - Where are you on Garabedian?<br> I'm working on it.<br> Robby say Macleish<br> thinks he's bluffing.<br> - I think there's<br> something there Ben.<br> - Get me something solid<br> or I'm taking you off him.<br> I don't want us chasing<br> our tails on this.<br> Stay away from that trap.<br> You couldn't reach that trap<br> in a million years partner.<br> - I could reach that trap before.<br> - Yeah, now Paul.<br> - How we doin'?<br> - Good.<br> We're two up in the front.<br> - How's that new editor working out?<br> - Well, he doesn't like baseball.<br> But, he seems like a smart guy.<br> Yeah, I read an article<br> about him, said he's a...<br> first jewish<br> editor of The Globe.<br> Must be the slow news day.<br> - He got a family, this guy?<br> - No, he is not married.<br> - Divorced?<br> - I don't think so, no.<br> So, the new editor of<br> The Globe is not married man...<br> of the jewish fate<br> who hates baseball.<br> - Yeah.<br> - So you give him to Ben.<br> It's Brad for crying out loud.<br> Didn't raise his hand<br> fast enough I guess.<br> Hey by the way, I've been<br> reading about this priest...<br> Father Barrett, said you<br> were involved with that?<br> Barrett yeah, bad egg.<br> Leaks that extra help we pitched in.<br> Victims said<br> Cardinal Law knew about...<br> Barrett, when he came<br> to Philly. Is that true?<br> You know I can't talk<br> about the case Robby.<br> Off the record?<br> Off the record,<br> I can't talk about it.<br> - This related to a lawsuit?<br> - You know about that?<br> Look.<br> I don't know this guy Baron...<br> or what his agenda is,<br> frankly I don't care.<br> I just don't wanna see<br> you taking bullet for.<br> I think you're away.<br> - Right over here.<br> - Lets go, lets go.<br> So the other day I was<br> on the world wide web.<br> Anything you wanna know,<br> it's right there.<br> Now, I have to admit<br> that as a priest,<br> this makes me<br> a little nervous.<br> Should I be worried about<br> job security?<br> I don't think so.<br> You see... Knowledge is one thing,<br> ... but fate. Fate is another.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - So should we golfing or something?<br> - "Golfing" is not a verb.<br> And I couldn't get a tee time.<br> Is that what they<br> call it, tee time?<br> They also call it<br> a leasure activity.<br> You oughta try it Mike.<br> - I do, I run.<br> - Yeah, you run to work.<br> So why are you here today?<br> Going over this clips of Saviano.<br> Yeah, Ben and Steve<br> thinks it's a dead end.<br> They gave me a bunch of<br> crap about it at the game.<br> - Yeah, Ben emailed me.<br> - He did?<br> - Yeah... He said we<br> should let it go.<br> - What do you wanna do?<br> - We bring Saviano in.<br> - So, just ignore those guys?<br> I think we got to start<br> ignoring everybody on this one.<br> I'm good at that.<br> Huh.<br> You think Marty has any idea<br> what's coming down to plank?<br> No, I don't think<br> he cares either.<br> That's refreshing.<br> Yeah.<br> Unless he's wrong.<br> I have always been fascinated<br> with the newspaper business.<br> I used to sit in on<br> the lectures with...<br> the Nieman fellows,<br> when I was at Harvard.<br> I, I read that you<br> were an editor once.<br> Yes. That was<br> a very long time ago.<br> The Mississippi Register. Small.<br> Diocese in newspaper.<br> But for 30 year old Pastor<br> it was a big responsibility.<br> Too much of times.<br> How so?<br> I was close with<br> the Everist brothers,<br> we took a stand on civil rights.<br> Our readership was not pleased.<br> They saw me as meddling outsider.<br> I can imagine.<br> Tough sit to sit in,<br> especially in a small town.<br> I think you'll find that Boston's...<br> still a small town too, Marty.<br> In any ways.<br> But if I can be of any help, Marty,<br> don't hesitate to ask.<br> I find that the city<br> flourishes...<br> when its grand<br> institution works together.<br> Thank you. Personally,<br> I'm of the opinion...<br> that for the paper to<br> best perform its function...<br> it really needs to stand alone.<br> of course. But my<br> offer still stands.<br> Thank you.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you, Maureen.<br> Little gift, Marty.<br> Think of it as a Cardinals<br> guide to the city of Boston.<br> CATHOLIC CHURCH<br> CATECHISM<br> - I'm here to see Sacha Pfeiffer.<br> - Your name?<br> - Phil Saviano.<br> - Ok, just a minute.<br> So, am I first<br> survivor you talk to?<br> - Yeah, sure you are.<br> - Ok, well...<br> First of all, let me say thank<br> you for having me in today.<br> And I want you to know<br> that you'll have...<br> the full cooperation of<br> my organization, SNAP.<br> How many members are in<br> your organization Phil?<br> We had 11, at our<br> last chapter meating...<br> No 10, Karen just moved.<br> You had a woman<br> in your group?<br> Of course there was a woman,<br> they don't discriminate,<br> not when it comes to abuse.<br> And this has nothing<br> to do with being gay.<br> What this is, is priest<br> using the collar to rape kids.<br> Kids, boys and girls.<br> PHIL SAVIANO<br> AGE 11<br> I was 11.<br> And I was preyed upon<br> by Father David Holly.<br> In Wester.<br> And I don't mean prayed for,<br> I mean preyed upon.<br> Are any of you catholic?<br> I was raised catholic,<br> now I go to my wife's<br> Presbyterian Church.<br> I'm lapsed, I go to Church<br> of my grandmother sometimes.<br> It's safe to say we were<br> all raised catholic, but now...<br> Not so much.<br> Ok, well let me tell you...<br> When you are poor<br> kid from a poor family,<br> religion counts for a lot.<br> And when a priest pays attention<br> to you, it's a big deal.<br> He ask you to collect a hymnals,<br> or take out a trash,<br> you feel special.<br> It's like God asking for help.<br> Maybe it's a little weird when<br> he tells you a dirty joke...<br> but now you got<br> a secret together.<br> So you go along.<br> Then he shows you a porno mag.<br> And then you go along,<br> and you go along...<br> And you go along.<br> Until one day he asks you to<br> jerk him off or give him a blowjob.<br> And so you go<br> along with that too.<br> Because you feel trapped,<br> because he has groomed you.<br> How do you say no<br> to a God, right?<br> See...<br> It is important to<br> understand that this is not...<br> just physical abuse,<br> it's spirital abuse too.<br> Then when a priest<br> does this to you,<br> he robs you of your faith.<br> So you reach for the bottle,<br> or the needle.<br> Or if those don't work<br> you jump of a bridge.<br> That's why we call<br> ourselves survivors.<br> Have you read Jason Barry's book,<br> he wrote about<br> a Gauthe case in Louisiana.<br> - That's G...<br> - G-a-u-t-h-e.<br> I talked to Richard Sipe,<br> he worked in one of...<br> the Church's treatment center.<br> He is an ex-priest.<br> Married a nun.<br> Yeah. This is his testimony<br> from the Cass case.<br> Phil, what's a treatment center?<br> It's where they send priests<br> when they get caught...<br> this is all right<br> here in the box.<br> I sent this all to<br> you guys 5 years ago.<br> To The Globe?<br> Who did you send it to?<br> I don't wanna say who,<br> but they said that<br> they weren't interested.<br> - But Phil... We did run a couple<br> stories on you, I saw them in the clips...<br> Yeah, but to be completely<br> frank it wasn't enough.<br> You guys gotta understand.<br> This is big.<br> This is not just Boston, this is<br> a whole country, it's a whole world.<br> And it goes right<br> up to the Vatican.<br> - Do you have any proof ot that, Phil?<br> - No, not yet.<br> But think about it,<br> there are so many of them.<br> How else could they if never saw one.<br> - So many what?<br> - Priests!<br> Priests! I know 13<br> right here in Boston.<br> You know 13 priest in Boston<br> who have molested children?<br> Yeah, why do you keep<br> repeating everything I say?<br> - I just like to clarify things.<br> - Maybe you should've<br> clarified it 5 years ago...<br> when I sent you<br> all of this stuff,<br> it's all right here.<br> - May I use your bathroom?<br> - Yeah, sure Phil.<br> Come on.<br> Well... What do you think?<br> - The guy's got an agenda, that's for sure.<br> - You think?<br> He's obviously been through<br> a lot, but he's smart and...<br> it's right about 13 priests.<br> Yeah, and might be<br> a big if with this guy.<br> Do a background check on him.<br> And follow up some of<br> the other survivors of this group.<br> I'll track on this<br> ex-priests and Sipe.<br> Ok, but stay on Garabedian,<br> that's more important.<br> Garabedian, what<br> a pain in the ass.<br> You can be a pain<br> in the ass, Mike.<br> Mitchell, what a surprise.<br> How are you?<br> - I'm fine Mr. Rezendes.<br> - Good, you know, I've never<br> heard back from you...<br> I left you a couple of messages.<br> I know.

I don't know<br> what that means.<br> I'm not supposed to tell you this<br> but I'm digging a run for Spotlight.<br> Spotlight is on this?<br> Yeah, we're looking into it<br> but you gotta help me.<br> You gotta let me talk<br> to some of these victims, please.<br> Please.<br> - Come back tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Ms. Pfeiffer.<br> - Joe.<br> Hi.<br> - Shit.<br> - That's ok.<br> - I'm sorry.

Thank you.<br> - Is this table ok?<br> - This is perfect.<br> I had a muffin while I was<br> waiting, two actually.<br> I eat when I'm nervous.<br> I did that too actually.<br> I hope I'm not late.<br> Phil told me 1 o'clock.<br> No, you're fine. I got<br> here early. About na hour.<br> Would you mind if I took some notes?<br> Would that be alright?<br> You don't mind if I take<br> some notes, do you?<br> You got to use my name?<br> No.<br> I'm not if you don't<br> want me to, no.<br> I just had a kid, he's only 1...<br> but I'm not sure I want<br> him to know about this.<br> Sure, I get that.<br> You can stop this<br> interview at any time Patrick.<br> - Alright?<br> - Ok.<br> Alright.<br> - You got it with your notes...<br> - Ok, so...<br> Where'd you live<br> when it first happen?<br> In the Projects,<br> over in Hyde Park.<br> - Over by the Stop & Shop?<br> - Yeah, you know it?<br> Yeah, I drove a cab for a few years?<br> Opened really bad coffee, right?<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> How old were you,<br> when it happened?<br> I was 12.<br> Just after my dad killed himself.<br> - Oh, geez.<br> - He was a real piece of shit.<br> And my mom she wasn't<br> so stable either.<br> - How do you mean?<br> - I mean she was nuts.<br> - She was schizophrenic.<br> - Same shit.<br> When did you first meet Geoghan?<br> Well, my sister... she saw him<br> over at the Dunkin' Donuts...<br> tells him about my old man<br> passing and he rushed right over.<br> And there was this nun sister<br> Barbara, and she ran this group...<br> for kids from troubled families.<br> - Where is that?<br> - San Ambrose in Dorchester.<br> Ok.<br> She's the one who<br> introduced me to Father Shanley.<br> He was a street priest,<br> long hair, very hip.<br> - He invited me to his inhabit in Back Bay.<br> - Where in Back Bay?<br> - Beacon street.<br> - Beacon, ok.<br> Are you from here?<br> No, I grew up in Ohio<br> but my mom is from Southie.<br> I see you got it. I've<br> never even seen Back Bay.<br> So, what happened on<br> that first visit Joe?<br> Well it was very nice at first.<br> Very funny. Very casual.<br> And I think he<br> could tell I was gay.<br> So he showed me<br> this mobile he had,<br> thing over the babies crib.<br> But with different words,<br> homosexual, transexual, bisexual.<br> Ok. And did you know that you<br> were gay at that time, Joe?<br> Yes, but that wasn't information<br> I'm sharing with anybody.<br> Not in Dorchester.<br> Ok.<br> So, what happened after<br> he showed you the mobile?<br> Well, I was a little freaked out.<br> I think he could tell...<br> So he said, you<br> know what'll help...<br> is if we play strip poker.<br> Of course I lost.<br> And thing went on from there.<br> Can you tell me<br> specifically what happened?<br> Specifically... He molested me.<br> Joe, I think that the language<br> is going to be so important here.<br> We can't sanitize this, just<br> saying 'molest' isn't enough.<br> People need to know<br> what actually happened.<br> - We should probably get these to go.<br> - Right.<br> Geoghan shows up and my mom,<br> you know she's...<br> She's thrilled. And...<br> this was like God<br> showing up, you know?<br> Sure, right.<br> So what happened then?<br> You really wanna hear this shit?<br> Yeah, yeah Patrick, I do.<br> He offers to take me<br> to get icecream.<br> - He's a priest.<br> I'm a kid so I go.<br> - Sure.<br> So we're driving home, and he...<br> He starts petting my leg.<br> You know and then...<br> His hand just...<br> slides right up and...<br> he grabs my dick, alright?<br> I just froze up,<br> I was fuckin' petrified...<br> I couldn't move.<br> I didn't know what to do,<br> I was just a little kid.<br> Yeah.<br> You know I never even<br> touched my icecream.<br> Just melted down my arm.<br> Did you...hm?<br> Did you see him<br> again after that?<br> Yeah.<br> Alright, that's good,<br> let's stop there for now.<br> Sure.<br> He said he was a way to make me<br> more comfortable with my body.<br> So, what happened after that?<br> He took off his clothes and<br> he said I've been so depressed,<br> but maybe you can cheer me up<br> and give a blowjob.<br> classic guy!<br> - And did you?<br> - Yeah.<br> I know what you<br> must be thinking, like...<br> why would I ever do that?<br> To some creepy guy who's<br> 30 years older than me, but...<br> but we have to understand is that<br> this is the first time in my life,<br> that someone told me<br> that it was ok to be gay.<br> And it was a priest.<br> So you had oral sex?<br> Did you have intercourse?<br> Yes, not then, but later.<br> It really messed me up.<br> I'm sober now, but that,<br> that was the beginning of it all .<br> It's very confusing, you know?<br> To be introduced to<br> sex like that and then,<br> and then to be attracted to men.<br> I'm sorry. I knew I was<br> gonna do this.

Macleish.<br> I thought he was<br> very handsome.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> I was just in a newsroom...<br> Jugde Sweeney set<br> a date for the hearing.<br> - Really, when?<br> - In two weeks, in Springfield.<br> Canellos started a pool<br> of 10 bucks to get in.<br> Anyone picking The Globe?<br> He's only taking best if how<br> fast Sweeney rules against us.<br> - Robby.<br> - Hi, it's me.<br> - Did you got my message?<br> - I did.<br> Looks like Father Shanley<br> could be our fourth priest.<br> - Yeah, I think he is.<br> - Did you follow up on Macleish?<br> I just talked with Phil,<br> he said Macleish...<br> dealt with a number<br> of this cases.<br> - I guess he forgot to mention that.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm gonna go to the courthouse<br> tomorrow, see if I can ...<br> find any cases he settled<br> against the Church.<br> Alright, call me<br> after yo do.<br> - Good night.<br> - Ok, good night.<br> Hey.<br> You on to a Jack?<br> Yeah, I'm late for dinner,<br> you wanna walk me out?<br> Sure.<br> - Jesus, does this<br> guy ever go home?<br> - Apparently not.<br> I got guys pull in till he does,<br> he's wearing over<br> the goddamn newsroom.<br> - Where are we on Geoghan?<br> - Yeah following up<br> on more victims.<br> - Hey I want to expend<br> the investigation. - Why?<br> We got fourth priest,<br> it might be as many as 13.<br> - 13?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who's your source?<br> - Phil Saviano.<br> Oh, Jesus Christ Robby,<br> I told Mike...<br> I know, I know.<br> I know, I think Saviano<br> might be legit, Ben.<br> - You want to elaborate on that?<br> - No, not really.<br> It just feels like this thing<br> is stacking up. He's my guy.<br> - Ok.<br> - Ok, good, thank you.<br> Hello?<br> - Mr. Rezendes?<br> - Yeah, who is this?<br> It's Richard Sipe.<br> Oh, yeah, hey Richard,<br> how are you?<br> I'm good.<br> Thanks for calling.<br> Look... Phil Saviano<br> gave me your name,<br> I was wondering if I could<br> ask you a few questions?<br> - Of course, yeah.<br> - Great.<br> So, Phil told me that you<br> were working at one of...<br> the Church's treatment<br> centers in Baltimore?<br> Yes, the Seton<br> Psychiatric Institute.<br> It was run by<br> the Daughters of Charity.<br> And ...?<br> When was that, Richard?<br> Well, I started my psychotherapy<br> fellowship there in 1965.<br> And I was there for 5 years,<br> then I spend the next 30...<br> studying abusive priests<br> and their victims.<br> Really?<br> And that's been your sole focus?<br> Look Mike, the Church<br> wants us to believe that...<br> it's just a few bad apples.<br> It's much bigger<br> problem than that.<br> - How much bigger, Richard?<br> - Well, based on the research...<br> I would classify it as<br> a recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.<br> That's big?<br> - Hey, Mag.<br> - Hey.<br> If I wanted historical<br> data on a priest,...<br> parishes, sit he'd been asigned to,<br> where would I find it?<br> The Geoghan case? It's all in clips.<br> Lis has this classed material.<br> Yeah, what if it was for another priest,<br> the one that hadn't been in the papers.<br> - Looking at another priest?<br> - Who're you looking at?<br> Any ideas?<br> Come on, Matt.<br> You're not gonna tell me?<br> I got to get to<br> a meeting, thanks Mag.<br> Hey, D.<br> The Archdioceses puts<br> out the annual directory.<br> Every priest in parish.<br> That's great. This go back<br> any further than '98?<br> Oh yeah, going back to<br> the '80 in the mass.<br> The all night you<br> got to go to the BPL.<br> - The mass, ah? Thanks, Lisa.<br> - Bye.<br> He said the all target<br> is the same kind of kid.<br> Low income families,<br> absentee fathers,...<br> broken homes.<br> For guy like Geoghan, goes after<br> boys, not because he prefers them...<br> but because they are more<br> ashamed,less likely to talk.<br> And these guys are<br> predators, Robby.<br> I talked to Sipe.<br> Said he's seen dozens<br> of them in '60 in Seton.<br> He called it a "phenomenon".<br> - Why didn't he go public?<br> - He did.<br> But the Church made a huge<br> effort to discredit him.<br> Smear campaigns. Public statements<br> by prominent Bishops.<br> It's just like Saviano said.<br> And Garabedian.<br> - You get anywhere with him?<br> - More victims.<br> More victims?<br> You can't empty his files.<br> I'll get to him,<br> I just need more time.<br> - Come on Mike, you got to get them.<br> - I'll get them, I'll get them.<br> Jesus, what the hell is that smell?<br> There's a dead rat in the corner.<br> What have you got?<br> Church directories.<br> It's every priest in Massachusetts.<br> - What parish they were assaigned to?<br> - Is it official?<br> Yeah, I figure it would<br> help us track down some...<br> of the priests<br> that Saviano mentioned.<br> Maybe find some more victims.<br> Can we turn on some<br> more light in here?<br> I couldn't find the switch.<br> Do you want to borrow my glasses?<br> - No, I'm good, I'm good.<br> - Look, look 1983.<br> John Geoghan,<br> Saint Brendan Parish Dorchester.<br> So, so we can find out...<br> where any priest is<br> at any given year?<br> Yeah, I got him here.<br> What?<br> 1980, the year Geoghan<br> was pulled from JP.<br> Said he's on sick leave.<br> Come on, it really says that?<br> Where is, 1991?<br> - Yeah, here.<br> - Let's see this.<br> Barry Liam, I can't read this,<br> look for Liam Barry there.<br> 1991 is the year they pulled<br> him of the Charleston abbey.<br> Burt Liam?<br> Yeah.<br> Sick leave.<br> That's an official designation.<br> Get this upstairs.<br> And match...Check on those<br> priests Saviano gave us.<br> Robby.<br> - I'm at the Court House.<br> - Yeah.<br> Something's not right here.<br> Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.<br> Ok, thanks.<br> Yeah, we need to go<br> talk to Macleish again.<br> Really? Why?<br> There's nothing here.<br> There aren't any records...<br> Thanks for waiting, so sorry guys.<br> Stuck in a call.<br> - Not a problem, how are you?<br> - Good.<br> - Thanks for meeting us.<br> - You bet. What's up guys?<br> Mr. Macleish, are you familiar<br> with the priest named Paul Shinley?<br> Yes, I am familiar with him.<br> And have you settled<br> cases against Father Shinley?<br> As I'm sure you can<br> understand, I can't...<br> discuss that with you.<br> Yeah, how about<br> Father Ronald Paquin?<br> Well, I can't discuss that<br> with you either, c'mon guys.<br> We understand you've settled<br> several cases against each of them.<br> Even if I've been<br> involved in those cases...<br> the settlements<br> would be confidential.<br> And I can be disbarred for<br> acknowledging their existence.<br> Ok?<br> Look, I told you guys,<br> these are tough cases.<br> Most of these folks, they<br> just want some acknowledgement...<br> of what happened.<br> We got them a sit down<br> with the Bishop and...<br> a little dough, and that's<br> the best they can hope for.<br> Well, certainly, the best<br> that priest could hope for.<br> No, the Church promises to take...<br> the priest out of circulation.<br> And did you follow up on that?<br> - You guys need anything else?<br> - Yes.<br> Why aren't there any records?<br> I was down at<br> the Court House earlier...<br> there aren't any records<br> of any of these settlements.<br> We dealt directly<br> with the Church.<br> We withdraw all but the man letter<br> and send it to the Chancery.<br> You never filed anything in Court?<br> - It's a private mediation.<br> - So...<br> this is just you and<br> the Archdiocese lawyers...<br> - in a room.<br> - Correct.<br> Anyone else?<br> Occasionally the Church would bring in<br> another defence attorney to help out.<br> - You know names?<br> - No.<br> No I don't.<br> So this was all under the table.<br> There's no paper trail, at all.<br> The victim has to sign<br> the confidentiality...<br> agreement to get the settlement.<br> The lawyer takes the third and...<br> the Church sweeps it under the rug.<br> - Jesus, that's freaking racket.<br> - It's more complicated than that.<br> Macleish has got<br> the duty to client...<br> to get the best deal he can.<br> Sure, but how many victims...<br> do you represent and profit from,<br> before you say someting?<br> Garabedian would say none.<br> And that's why he's taking<br> these cases to Court.<br> Because he wants<br> people to know about this.<br> I agree.<br> And legal acts is aside,<br> Ben, I mean...<br> operating the way Macleish has,<br> all the guarantee is that<br> abuse stays under wraps.<br> Yeah, did Macleish confirm<br> all Saviano's priests?<br> No, he is...<br> limited by his<br> confidentiality agreement.<br> But clearly he settles cases<br> against a number of them.<br> Phil's put me in touch with<br> some of the other victims,<br> I'm pretty confident all of his<br> priests are going to check out.<br> - So there's 13 priests?<br> - Yeah.<br> Looks that way.<br> Holy shit!<br> Ok, keep going.<br> CATHOLIC CHARITIES GALA<br> Guest List<br> I'm sorry, what was<br> the name again?<br> Baron.<br> B-A-R-O-N.<br> I'm having trouble finding it,<br> just give me a second.<br> It's ok Kim, I can vouch for him.<br> I'm Pete Conley, I'm on<br> the Board of Catholic Charities.<br> Welcome to Boston, Mr. Baron.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Appreciate you joining us.<br> We're very proud of the work<br> we do here at Boston.<br> Oh, the Cardinal said<br> you had a nice visit.<br> - Yes. We did.<br> - He's an extraordinary man.<br> I'm glad you had<br> a chance to chat.<br> Enjoying yourself?<br> To be honest, these events<br> aren't really my strong suit.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you involved with The Charity?<br> Not directly, no.<br> Some of my friends are,<br> we all went to...<br> highschool, BC High, that's a...<br> school across the street<br> from The Globe.<br> - It's hard to miss.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hard to get away<br> from too apparently.<br> The Cardinal is in the corner,<br> if you're so inclined.<br> - We've met.<br> - Really?<br> Did he mentioned the suit?<br> No, but he did give<br> me a copy of cathecism.<br> Yeah, well, the Cardinal is<br> not known for his subtlety.<br> During the Porter investigation,<br> he'd literally...<br> call down the power<br> of God on the Globe.<br> How that got out?<br> Week later, I got<br> broke leg skiing.<br> Shrimp toast, gentlemen?<br> No, thanks. Thanks.<br> He said one of<br> the victims father...<br> a criminal complaint?<br> Yeah, there were a few of them.<br> But the Judge had<br> the case reconciled...<br> after friends of<br> the Church complained.<br> And the Church has<br> a lot of friends.<br> Like Eric Macleish?<br> Yeah. Let's just say...<br> he is not part of the solution.<br> - You follow what I'm saying.<br> - Sure.<br> You work hard Mr. Rezendes.<br> Are you married?<br> Yeah.<br> And your wife doesn't mind<br> you working all the time?<br> Yeah, she does.<br> That's why I never got married.<br> To busy.<br> What I do is to important.<br> Your new editor,<br> he's a jew, right?<br> - That's right, yeah.<br> - Well, see...<br> He comes in ...<br> and suddenly everybody is<br> interested in the Church.<br> - You know why?<br> - No.<br> Because it takes the outsider.<br> Like me. I'm Armenian.<br> How many Armenians<br> do you know in Boston?<br> Steve Kurkjian, works at The Globe.<br> That's two. You should<br> get a prize or something.<br> - What are you, Italian?<br> - No, I'm Portugese.<br> - From where?<br> - East Boston.<br> Really? East Boston?<br> You don't sound like it.<br> This city.<br> This people.<br> Making the rest of us<br> feel like we don't belong.<br> But they're no better than us.<br> Look at how they<br> treat their children.<br> Mark my words Mr. Rezendes,<br> if it takes the village<br> to raise the child,<br> it takes the village to abuse one.<br> - Hey, there he is.<br> - Hey.<br> - You want a beer?<br> - Love one.<br> - Another? You with Barbara?<br> - No, no.<br> - She hates this things.<br> - Karen too.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Smart ladies.<br> - Slinte.<br> - Slinte.<br> I met your new editor.<br> - Somebody a decent fella.<br> - I think he is.<br> Hey, I had an interesting conversation<br> with Eric Macleish the other day.<br> Turns out he's been<br> settling abuse cases...<br> with the Archdioceses for years.<br> You want to talk about this here?<br> Jim... You said you helped out...<br> on the Father Barrett as a favor.<br> That was a loan off?<br> How many of these cases<br> you've been involved with?<br> You know I can't answer<br> that Robby, it's unethical.<br> Is that all it is?<br> So, this...<br> would be the Robby Robinson<br> I've always...<br> heard about, but never met.<br> Listen, Jimmy.<br> You want to be on<br> the right side of this.<br> This is the Church,<br> you're talking about Robby.<br> Look around,<br> these are good people,<br> done a lot of good<br> for this city.<br> Enjoy the party.<br> I've been through<br> a lot these now.<br> "Sick leave" isn't<br> the only designation...<br> they use when they take one...<br> of these priests<br> out of the circulation.<br> They use slew of terms.<br> Absent on leave...<br> On assign. Emergency response.<br> - They work for everything, these guys.<br> - Except belief.<br> And they move parishes...<br> way more frequently<br> than other priests.<br> When I was a kid, priest<br> moved after 7, 8 years.<br> Sometimes longer.<br> These guys,<br> it's 2 to 3 years tops.<br> And did they use<br> this designation...<br> for all Saviano's priests?<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's pretty clear pattern.<br> - Guys, I got Sipe.<br> I think that if you really<br> want to understand the crisis...<br> you need to start with<br> the celibacy requirement.<br> That was my first<br> major finding.<br> Only 50% of the clergy are celibat.<br> Now, most of them are having<br> sex with other adults.<br> But the fact remains<br> that this creates...<br> a culture of secrecy that<br> tolerates and even protects...<br> pedophiles.<br> So you believe<br> the Church is aware...<br> of the extent of this... crisis?<br> Well, absolutely.<br> After the first major<br> scandal in Louisiana...<br> Tom Doyle, the secretary<br> candidacy for papal nuncio...<br> co-opted a report...<br> warning pedophile priests,<br> were billion dollar liability.<br> That was in 1985.<br> - 1985?<br> - That's right.<br> Who saw that report, anyone<br> from the catholic hierarchy?<br> Sure.<br> Doyle tried to<br> introduce the report...<br> at the National Conference<br> of Catholic Bishops.<br> In fact, Cardinal Law initially<br> helped to fund the report.<br> But then he backed out<br> and he shelved it.<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> - Oh, Richard.<br> Robby here.<br> We think we have 13 priests...<br> in Boston, that fits<br> this pattern, which...<br> would be a very,<br> very big story.<br> Does that sound right to you?<br> In terms of scale?<br> No, not really, Robby.<br> Sounds low to me.<br> My estimate suggests 6% act<br> out sexually with minors.<br> 6%, of what?<br> 6% of all priests.<br> How many priest do<br> we have in Boston?<br> About 1.500, 1% is 15, 6% is...<br> 90?<br> - Right, 90 priests.<br> - Is that possible?<br> From a metric standpoint.<br> Yes. That would certainly<br> be amount of my findings.<br> Hello?<br> 90 fucking priests? In Boston?<br> That's what he said.<br> If there were 90 of these<br> bastards, people would know.<br> - Maybe they do.<br> - And no one said a thing?<br> Good Germans.<br> I don't think that's a comparison<br> you want to make publicly.<br> Macleish knew.<br> - He just didn't say anything.<br> - That's 13 priests.<br> There's a big difference<br> between 13 and 90...<br> Where's this Sipe guy<br> getting his numbers?<br> Well, he's been studying<br> it for 30 years...<br> He is a trained psychotherapist.<br> Ok, but we need something<br> more than a metric from some...<br> hippie ex-priest who's<br> shacking up with the nun.<br> Ok so, we'll track<br> down more victims.<br> We'll get more priests, then...<br> then we could, we could check<br> them against the directories.<br> - That's a shitload of victims.<br> - We'll get there.<br> How long is it going to take?<br> Too long.<br> - Wait, what, the meeting is over?<br> - Yeah, for now.<br> - What do you got?<br> - What if we work backwards?<br> - What do you mean?<br> From what?<br> - From the directories.<br> We've been using them<br> to confirm bad priests.<br> What if we do it<br> the other way around.<br> Use the directories<br> so we identify bad priests.<br> Yeah, exactly.<br> We search by designation.<br> You know, we look<br> for any priest...<br> on a sick leave or unassigned.<br> - But who've been<br> moved around a lot.<br> - Yeah.<br> Which can take a longer work.<br> Well, not if we're all on it.<br> You too?<br> Generally, that's what<br> all means, yeah.<br> Yeah, generally.<br> Sick Leave<br> Unassigned<br> unassigned<br> active<br> Library is closing!<br> Library is closing!<br> O Sullivan, Eugene M.<br> Treatment Center<br> Oh shit!<br> No freaking way.<br> KIDS.<br> Stay away from this<br> house at 276 Pelton Street.<br> And stay away from<br> the men who live inside it.<br> - Talbot?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Tivnan?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Toma?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Turnbull?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Walsh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Welsh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Is that it.<br> - That's it.<br> Holy shit! Robby?<br> That's 3 off Sipe estimate,<br> that's incredible.<br> Robby!<br> - How many?<br> - 87.<br> 87 priests in Boston.<br> - Call Macleish.<br> I want to talk to him.<br> - Ok.<br> - Can you print it?<br> - Sure I can.<br> Jim Sullivan's office?<br> Yeah, Walter Robinson<br> for Jim Sullivan.<br> Tell him it's important, please.<br> One moment please.<br> Hey, Robby, everything ok?<br> I need you to tell me<br> something, Jim.<br> - Could it be 90 priests?<br> - What?<br> Could it be as high as 90?<br> Jesus, Robby!<br> I need to know, Jim.<br> I wouldn't be asking<br> if it wasn't important.<br> You're gonna stop this, Robby.<br> Robby, Macleish's assistant...<br> said he's all booked up,<br> he can't see us.<br> Yeah, well, the hell he can't.<br> Alright, it'll be fine.<br> - You know I'll not catch<br> up with you, ok? - Ok.<br> Hey guys, I'm really sorry,<br> I am, I don't have any ...<br> time to talk right now but...<br> - Mr. Macleish.<br> - If you call my assistant.<br> We have reasons to believe<br> that there are...<br> allegations against as many<br> as 87 priests in Boston.<br> I can't talk to you about that.<br> Does that number<br> sound right to you?<br> You gotta be kidding me,<br> I just told you...<br> I don't have time for this crap.<br> Eric, how many<br> priests did you sign?<br> Robby, you know<br> I can't tell you that.<br> You're going to give<br> me their names...<br> and the names of their victims.<br> - Are you threatening me?<br> - We've got two stories here.<br> We got a story<br> about degenerate clergy.<br> And we got a story<br> about a bunch of lawyers...<br> turning child abuse<br> into a cottage industry.<br> Now, which story do<br> you want us to write?<br> Cause we're writing one of them.<br> I already sent you<br> a list of names.<br> What are you talking about?<br> To whom?<br> The Globe, years ago.<br> After the Porter case<br> I got plenty of calls.<br> I had 20 priests...<br> in Boston alone.<br> But I couldn't go after<br> them without the press.<br> So I sent you guys...<br> a list of names<br> and you buried it.<br> - I want those names tomorrow.<br> - Check you goddamn clips, Robby.<br> - I didn't find anything in the clips.<br> - Yeah, big surprise.<br> Richard...<br> Do you still go to mass?<br> No, I haven't been to Church<br> for some time now.<br> But I still consider<br> myself a catholic.<br> How does that work?<br> Well, the Church is<br> an institution, Mike.<br> Made of men.<br> It's passing...<br> My faith is in the eternal.<br> I try to separate the two.<br> Sounds tricky.<br> It is. Especially...<br> since the Church continues<br> to go after me.<br> It takes the toll, Mike.<br> They'll try to silence<br> anyone who speaks out.<br> And I'm sure they'll come after you<br> and your team soon enough.<br> Really? And how do you<br> think they'll do that?<br> Hello? Richard?<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's the Archbishop of Canterbury.<br> I had dinner at Santarpio's,<br> that's some leftovers.<br> You're the freaking best.<br> Thanks. You want a beer?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You got it.<br> Jesus. How much longer...<br> you're gonna be<br> in this shithole??<br> Yeah, I'm working on it.<br> - She's a good girl, Mike.<br> - Yeah, she is.<br> We'll figure it out. I haven't<br> had a lot of time lately.<br> I just got off the phone<br> with Sipe, actually.<br> Have you met this<br> guy in person yet?<br> No, but his knowledge on this<br> is on a whole other level.<br> I'm freaking starving.<br> So, where are we with the 90?<br> - I'm close.<br> - How close?<br> I'm close.<br> Just answer the question, will ya?<br> We got 87 names.<br> We're trying to get confirmation,<br> I think we will.<br> Something bugging you?<br> It's just surprise, that's all.<br> Yeah, yeah it is.<br> For everybody.<br> Hey, Ben, I forgot to ask you.<br> Hey Phil Saviano<br> said he sent a bunch of...<br> info over to The Globe a years ago,<br> do you have an idea to whom?<br> - No, why?<br> - Well, I'm just curious.<br> I wanted to see if there's any<br> lead you guys didn't worn out.<br> Saviano was a fucking train wreck...<br> 5 years ago, but we<br> didn't miss anything.<br> This story needs Spotlight.<br> Yeah, I agree.<br> I'm just following up.<br> - Good night.<br> - Yeah, good night.<br> - This is unbelievable.<br> - When did you get this?<br> Macleish emailed<br> the list this morning.<br> He settled cases<br> against 45 priests.<br> Where are we on Law?<br> Anything that shows<br> the acknowledge of this.<br> - Still working Garabedian.<br> But nothing concrete.<br> I keep thinking about that<br> conversation we had the other night,<br> about how Law called<br> down the power of God.<br> When we reported the Porter.<br> That's just Law being Law.<br> Ok, but I checked the clips...<br> And Porter, isn't even...<br> in Boston Archdiocese,<br> he's from Fall River.<br> So...<br> Why the extreme reaction?<br> Law had to know.<br> That's why he had the reaction.<br> Senior than others.<br> I think that's<br> the bigger story.<br> Bigger than 50 priests?<br> If it came from<br> the top down? Yes.<br> But the numbers clearly indicate that<br> there were senior clergy involved.<br> - That's all they do "indicate".<br> - Are you telling me that...<br> that if we run a story about<br> 50 pedophile priests in Boston.<br> - Mike.<br> - We're going to the same cat<br> fight you got in to on Porter.<br> Which made a lot of noise,<br> but changed things not one bit.<br> We need to focus<br> on the institution.<br> Not the individual priests.<br> Practice and policy.<br> Show me the Church<br> manipulate the system...<br> so this guy wouldn't<br> have to face charges.<br> Show me they put<br> those same priests...<br> back into parishes<br> time and time again.<br> Show me this was systemic<br> that it came from the top down.<br> Sound like we're<br> going after Law.<br> We're going after the system.<br> Make the list of all the victims...<br> we have, start reaching out.<br> - And bring Matt in if you need help.<br> - Ok.<br> - Hey when do you go to Springfield?<br> - Hearing's on monday.<br> Ok.<br> Hey, Robby, you got a second?<br> Yeah.<br> I, I got one of those treatment<br> centers a block from my house.<br> We got neighbours with kids.<br> I know that the work we do<br> is confidential but,<br> I'm feeling like...<br> I should tell 'em.<br> - We'll tell 'em soon.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Ok.<br> Hi there, I'm Sacha Pfeiffer,<br> with The Boston Globe.<br> It's just looking for the gentleman<br> by the name of Matthew Walsh?<br> No, he's not.<br> - Take there right.<br> - Ok.<br> - Hi<br> - Hi.<br> I'm Sacha Pfeiffer<br> from The Boston Globe.<br> Yeah, what do you want?<br> I'd like to speak<br> with Thomas Kennedy?<br> He doesn't live here any more.<br> Do you know where he lives?<br> Ser, I'd just like to ask a few...<br> Sacha Pfeiffer, Boston Globe.<br> - Oh, yeah, hi.<br> - Hi. Thank you.<br> - Anything else you can recall?<br> - No.<br> No, but I got<br> a cousin in Queens...<br> he sure saw him in the streets<br> a few years later.<br> The bishop came<br> over to house.<br> He said nothing like this<br> ever happened before...<br> and he asked us not<br> to press charges.<br> And what did your mother do?<br> My mother?<br> She put out freakin cookies.<br> There was a lot of<br> pressure to keep quiet.<br> From the Church?<br> Yeah, from the Church.<br> But not just the Church.<br> From my friends.<br> From the other parishoners.<br> Well, many of the priest<br> I treated were...<br> psychosexually stunted.<br> On the emotional level of<br> the 12 or 13 year old.<br> Jesus.<br> Sure the chief knew.<br> EVerybody knew.<br> But nobody wants<br> to come for priest.<br> And what about the prosecutor?<br> I shouldn't talk about this shit.<br> I think you should, actually.<br> Do you know Father Hurley<br> or Father Gale?<br> I do.<br> Just get your shit<br> out of here, alright?<br> I'm sorry about it.<br> You leave me alone,<br> you leave my brother alone...<br> you hear me goddammit?<br> Hi there.<br> I'm looking for Ronald Paquin.<br> Yes?<br> - You're Father Paquin?<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> I'm Sacha Pfeiffer<br> from The Boston Globe.<br> Ok.<br> Could I ask you a few questions?<br> Go ahead, dear.<br> We spoke to several men who<br> knew you when they were boys...<br> at St. John the Baptist in Haverhill.<br> They told us you molested<br> them, is that true?<br> Sure, I fooled around.<br> But I never felt gratified myself.<br> Right, but you admit to molesting<br> the boys at St. John the Baptist?<br> Yes, yes, but as I said,<br> I never got any pleasure from them.<br> That's important to understand.<br> Right, but...<br> Can you tell me where and how<br> you fooled around with these boys?<br> I want to be clear,<br> I never raped anybody.<br> There's a difference.<br> I should know.<br> - How would you know?<br> - I was raped.<br> I'm sorry, who raped you?<br> Darling, who are<br> you talking too?<br> - It's ok, Jane.<br> - Father, who raped you?<br> Who are you?<br> - Sacha Pfeiffer, from The Globe.<br> - Please, get off my porch.<br> - Get inside the house, Ronald.<br> - Mister...<br> - Get inside once!<br> - Alright.<br> - I'm sorry, who are you?<br> - I'm his sister.<br> - And I don't want you coming back here.<br> - Miss Paquin?<br> No, you won't,<br> I beat you last time....<br> Cause you cheated...<br> Could you please clarify<br> The Globe's position for me, Mr. Albano?<br> Yes, Judge Sweeney.<br> Our argument to make<br> this documents public rest...<br> mainly on First Amendment grounds.<br> We also have a number<br> of other relevant arguments.<br> After all, Your Honor,<br> this was discretionary audit.<br> Yes, it was made<br> the Judges discretionary.<br> Hey Mike!<br> Hey, Joe.<br> What's the Spotlight<br> reporter doing in Springfield?<br> Your boy Albano is sliding uphill.<br> Actually thinking he has<br> a shot of winning this thing?<br> You want me to comment<br> for The Herald?<br> Globe reporter would not comment.<br> But he did not seem hopeful.<br> He didn't try<br> to hide it at all.<br> He had this really odd<br> rationalization for it,<br> like it was totally normal<br> to fool around with little boys.<br> I'd really like to go back,<br> I think he'd talk to us.<br> Oh, we will.<br> Just not yet.<br> I want you to stay focused<br> on the victims right now.<br> Sacha, where did they send<br> Father Talbot again?<br> - I think, wasn't it at Scheffers.<br> - Scheffers, that's right.<br> Wait, Father Talbot, from BCI?<br> - Yeah, you know him?<br> - Yeah, he was there when I was.<br> - We have a victim?<br> - Yeah.<br> Lives in Providence.<br> There's nothing personal<br> within this documents, Your Honor.<br> They can serve how<br> the Cardinal is handling ...<br> Say the "Archdiocese".<br> Excuse me?<br> You don't get to tag the Cardinal<br> with everything, Mr. Albano.<br> Say, the Archdiocese.<br> Judge Sweeney, The Globe<br> is not a party to this case.<br> They just want to<br> sell the papers.<br> If Mr. Garabedian, had not...<br> smeared the Cardinal's good name...<br> - we wouldn't even be here.<br> - Your Honor,<br> I object to the use<br> of the word "smear".<br> - Duly noted, Mr. Garabedian.<br> - Thank you, Your Honor.<br> - Anything else, Mr. Rogers?<br> - No, Your Honor.<br> Sr. Albano, you may continue.<br> The Globe's really having...<br> Hola Mitch, how you doin'?<br> I'm fine.<br> He's tough that Wilson Rogers.<br> He's smug.<br> - He's sloppy.<br> - Doesn't seem sloppy.<br> You don't know<br> the half of it. Trust me.<br> What's the half of it?<br> Tell me the half of it, Mitch?<br> - Of the record.<br> - Of the record, yeah.<br> 3 years ago I get the call<br> from an ex-priest.<br> Anthony Benzevich.<br> He was at Blessed Sacrament<br> back in '62...<br> and he saw Geoghan.<br> Taking little boys up to<br> the rectory bedroom, ok?<br> So he's bold, alright?<br> - Alright.<br> - Tells the bishop about it.<br> And the bishop<br> threatens to reassign him.<br> - To South America.<br> - Jesus.<br> Yeah.<br> Alright, so fast-forward 35 years.<br> Benzevich reads that Geoghan<br> has been charged...<br> with molesting hundreds of kids.<br> Alright, so he feels guilty<br> and he calls me.<br> So you have<br> a testimony of a priest...<br> telling his superiors<br> about Geoghan in '62?<br> No, I do not.<br> Because when I call Benzevich<br> in to give a deposition...<br> He comes in with the lawyer.<br> - Wilson Rogers?<br> - Right.<br> And suddenly Father Benzevich<br> has a very foggy memory.<br> Can't remember anything.<br> He's useless.<br> So, I go back to work.<br> I forget about it, whatever.<br> Until about a year ago, I find<br> an article about a priest...<br> who warned Church officials<br> about Geoghan.<br> - Benzevich went to the press?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, local paper Patriot Ledger,<br> nobody saw it, but now<br> I got Benzevich on record.<br> so, I file a motion to depose...<br> Benzevich the second time.<br> Alright? And Wilson Rogers,<br> that smug son of a bitch,<br> he files a motion,<br> opposing my motion.<br> And that's when I have him.<br> - Have, have him how?<br> - Rogers opposes my motion.<br> So I have to make an argument<br> as to why am I allowed to...<br> depose Father Benzevich<br> the second time, ok?<br> But this time I'm allowed<br> to attach exhibits.<br> - You follow what I'm saying?<br> - The sealed documents?<br> Yes. I can attach<br> the sealed documents...<br> that I've gotten in discovery,<br> Mr. Rezendes.<br> The same documents that your<br> paper is currently suing for.<br> - You're shitting me?<br> - What? No, no,<br> I'm not shitting you.<br> So, I pull out the 14<br> most eminent docs...<br> and I attach them to my motion.<br> And they prove everything.<br> Everything.<br> About the Church, about<br> the bishops, about Law.<br> And it's all public...<br> Because your motion...<br> to oppose Rogers motion is public.<br> Is public, yeah. Exactly.<br> Now you're paying attention.<br> And so I could just walk in<br> to that courthouse right now...<br> and get those documents?<br> No, you can not.<br> Because the documents<br> are not there.<br> But you just said<br> they're public.<br> I know I did.<br> But this is Boston.<br> And the Church does not<br> want them to be found,<br> so, they are not there.<br> Mitch, are you telling me<br> that the Catholic Church...<br> removed legal documents<br> from that courthouse?<br> - Look, I'm not crazy,<br> I'm not paranoid.<br> I'm experienced.<br> Check the docket, you'll see.<br> They control everything.<br> Everything.<br> I got to go back.<br> I just got the fucking documents!<br> - Docket entry number 49,<br> with the Geoghan case.<br> - Ok, thanks.<br> - We're closing in 10 minutes.<br> - 10 minutes? Alright.<br> - Rev. James F. Talbot -<br> - Robby.<br> - Hey, it's me.<br> - Hey.<br> - You're not gonna believe it.<br> Garabedian gave me a tip.<br> Some of the sealed<br> docs are already public.<br> They're part of<br> the motioning file.<br> He said they're the best of<br> a bunch, we don't have to...<br> wait for Sweeney's ruling.<br> So, we can get them?<br> Yeah, but they<br> are not there.<br> I already talked to Albano,<br> he said all we<br> have to do is...<br> file a motion<br> and Sweeney will...<br> order Mitch to refile the docs.<br> And you think<br> this documents are...?<br> He said this 14 docs<br> are all we need.<br> They are huge.<br> - Ok. I'll call Ben.<br> Good work.<br> - What happened?<br> - They are saying<br> it's a prop plane.<br> But that's not a prop plane.<br> Tell Linda to get every...<br> reporter we have in here now.<br> You pray for the victims,<br> you pray for the injured...<br> and you pray for<br> those who survived.<br> You pray too for the nation.<br> That our response to this...<br> might reflect the best<br> ideals of our nation.<br> And even more reflect<br> God's own teaching.<br> Not only as it's shown in<br> Christianity and Judaism...<br> but in Islam as well.<br> - Not bad. Who's there?<br> - Paulson.<br> I want to talk to<br> him when he's back.<br> Did Rezendes find a way<br> to get to Florida yet?<br> They just opened<br> the airport in Providence,<br> he's on his way there now.<br> - Ben I'm gonna need more<br> people on mass report.<br> - I'll give you three of my guys.<br> Robby, put your team on that too.<br> Got it.<br> - And Robby, everything else stops.<br> - Understood.<br> - Why is Mike going to Florida?<br> - Flight school.<br> That's where they<br> learned to fly.<br> Robby, I've got...<br> a lot of victims<br> introduce set up this week.<br> - We got to cancel them.<br> - That's gonna be hard.<br> I know.<br> This is nuts.

Did you<br> refile those docs yet?<br> No, I just got the order.<br> It takes time.<br> - Ok, great.<br> Can you hold off...<br> on refiling...<br> - Hold on?<br> I have to go to Florida...<br> Once you refile,<br> they're public.<br> Other newspaper will be able<br> to get a hold of them.<br> "Other newspapers<br> are not my concern.<br> I received the judicial order.<br> I told you the Church<br> is watching me.<br> Hey Mitch, please.<br> All I need is<br> a few more weeks.<br> I can't make any promises.<br> Goodbye.<br> Mitch! Mitch! Shit!<br> Shit.<br> Look, I get it.<br> No one wants to read about<br> kids getting raped by priests.<br> Especially now, but you asked...<br> a lot of people to relive...<br> some very painful experiences...<br> Phil you know why we were<br> taking off of this story...<br> It's been six weeks since 9/11.<br> I realize that, and we're<br> gonna get back to it.<br> When?<br> You're doing the same thing<br> you guys did the last time.<br> No.<br> - You're dropping us.<br> - No.<br> Maybe I should tell<br> The Herald that story.<br> Ok, Phil. You go<br> ahead and do that.<br> It'll undo all<br> the work we've done.<br> But I can't stop you.<br> Listen to me.<br> I am here because I care.<br> We're not going away.<br> We're gonna tell this story,<br> we're gonna tell it right.<br> We just need a little more time.<br> That's all we're asking for.<br> Why bother asking?<br> You're gonna do<br> what you want anyway.<br> You always do.<br> Phil...

That's it.<br> - Good night.<br> - Ok. Good night.<br> So I was probably a few<br> years after you, right?<br> No, you were more<br> than a few.

Yeah.<br> But I love the city.<br> And we just had<br> our third kid...<br> and I still get my Globe<br> for the record.<br> That's good to know,<br> good to know.<br> Look, Kevin...<br> It's actually why I'm here.<br> I...<br> Need to ask you some<br> questions about Father Talbot.<br> - How'd you find out?<br> - Well...<br> I guess it doesn't matter.<br> I never even told my wife.<br> Excuse me!<br> - Hey, hey, I need<br> to get in there!<br> - We're closed.<br> Come on, let me in,<br> 5 minutes.<br> I'm sorry, we're closed.<br> C'mon. 5 minutes.<br> Fuck!<br> Here you go.<br> - This is the Geoghan case?<br> - That's right.<br> - Those records are sealed.<br> - No. That's a public motion.<br> Those record are public.<br> Look, I work for The Globe.<br> Good for you.<br> - Can I talk to your supervisor?<br> - He's not in today.<br> What about a Judge?<br> There must be Judges that<br> work on this kind of thing.<br> 6th floor.<br> We understand the nature...<br> of the allegations<br> against Father Talbot.<br> I'm just not sure what you<br> want from President Kemeza.<br> - Talbot taught here long<br> before Bill took over.<br> - Of course.<br> We just want to know<br> if that's possible...<br> that the President,<br> the Faculty, the Board...<br> that no one knew what<br> was going on at the time.<br> I graduated in 1979 and...<br> I had no idea<br> about any of this, so...<br> If you're suggesting<br> that Father Gibbons...<br> and Father Callahan,<br> had in anyway...<br> Gibbons and Callahan...<br> I'm hearing this<br> place was like the Navy.<br> You really think<br> they didn't know?<br> It's a big school, Robby.<br> You know that.<br> And we're talking<br> about seven...<br> alleged victims over<br> what, eight years?<br> Well, we're talking about, you know...<br> Seven that we know about.<br> This is ridiculous!<br> - You're reaching for the story here...<br> - Jack. Jack, Jack.<br> If I had been President then,<br> I would have known.<br> Bill, I'm not sure<br> that's relevant.<br> Why do you think they sent<br> Talbot up to Cheverus?<br> You know, they wanted<br> him out of town.<br> Robby...<br> As well intentioned this<br> Bill's remarks are,<br> I'm hoping we can<br> keep this between us...<br> until we all get<br> on the same page.<br> Is that why we are here?<br> To get on the same page?<br> No. We're here because<br> you're in the poor...<br> dilemmas Robby and a friend.<br> Exactly.

Darcy...<br> Auxiliary Bishop of Boston,<br> December 7. 1984.<br> - An Auxiliary Bishop wrote that?<br> - That's incredible.<br> He broke ranks, I mean...<br> When did Gallet write that letter?<br> - 1984.<br> - And Law just ignored it.<br> How do you ignore<br> that freaking letter?<br> We got them.<br> You can't read this letters<br> and think anything else.<br> It's proof.<br> Yeah, it is.<br> - This is good work.<br> - Should we take it up to Ben?<br> - No, not yet.<br> - Why not?<br> We got Law. This is it.<br> No, this is Law<br> covering for one priest.<br> There's other 90 out there.<br> Yeah, we'll print that<br> story when we get it.<br> But we got to go<br> with this now.<br> No, I'm not gonna<br> rush this story, Mike.<br> But we don't have a choice, Robby.<br> If we don't rush to print somebody<br> else is gonna find this letters...<br> and butcher the story.<br> John Quinby from The Herald<br> was at the freaking courthouse.<br> So we'll write a holding story...<br> and we'll keep our<br> eye on The Herald.<br> - Keep our eye on The Herald?<br> - Yeah.<br> If they run this and<br> they get it wrong...<br> the Church will bury it.<br> We got to do this now.<br> - Mike, Mike.<br> - What? Why are we hesitating?<br> Baron told us to get Law.<br> This is Law.<br> Baron told us to<br> get the system.<br> We need the full scope.<br> That's the only thing that<br> will put an end on this.<br> Then let's take it up to<br> Ben and let him decide.<br> We'll take to Ben<br> when I say it's time.<br> It's time, Robby! It's time!<br> They knew and<br> they let it happen...<br> to kids. Ok?<br> It could have been you,<br> It could have been me.<br> It could have<br> been any of us.<br> We gotta nail these scumbags.<br> We gotta show people...<br> that nobody can<br> get away with this.<br> Not a priest or a Cardinal,<br> or a freaking Pope!<br> - You finished?<br> - Yeah, I am.<br> This is bullshit!<br> You ok?<br> - Hi Hansi.<br> - Hard day at work, Mike?<br> - Here.<br> - Thank you.<br> I don't know why I got<br> so pissed off, you know.<br> I think Robby is wrong.<br> You know, you just...<br> You care about<br> the story, Mike. We all do.<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> I stopped going to<br> Church with my nana.<br> It was...It was to<br> hard, you know.<br> I'd be sitting<br> there and I...<br> I would start thinking<br> about Joe Crowley...<br> or someone else<br> and I just...<br> I just got so angry.<br> Did you, did you<br> tell her why?<br> She goes to Church<br> 3 times a week, Mike.<br> It really pisses me off.<br> Yeah.<br> I actually really liked going<br> to Church when I was a little kid.<br> - Why did you stop?<br> - Typical shit.<br> But the weird thing is, is...<br> I think I...<br> I think I figured that<br> maybe one day I would...<br> I would actually go back.<br> I really, I was<br> holding on to that.<br> Then I read<br> those letters and...<br> And something's just...<br> cracked.<br> - It's a shitty feeling.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's a shitty feeling.<br> - Looks like a long day.<br> - Hey Pete.<br> I'm sorry to make it longer.<br> Brian...<br> Does anyone ever said no<br> to a drink with you, Pete.<br> Well sure.<br> The trick is to keep asking.<br> - For Boston.<br> - For Boston.<br> - So... You're here<br> for the Cardinal?<br> - No, no, no. I wouldn't.<br> I wouldn't presume to speak<br> for the Cardinal, you know.<br> You know?<br> You got a lot of people<br> here respect you, Robby.<br> - Yeah.<br> - With work you do.<br> - That's good to know.<br> - You know, it's cause you<br> care about this place.<br> Yeah.<br> That's why you do what<br> you do, that's who you are.<br> You know people<br> need the Church.<br> More than ever right now.<br> You know, you can feel it.<br> And the Cardinal...<br> You know, the Cardinal,<br> he might not be perfect...<br> But we can't throw our<br> other goodies doing...<br> over few bad apples.<br> Now, you know I'm<br> bringing this up to you...<br> because I know this is<br> Baron's idea, his agenda.<br> I gotta tell you,<br> honest to God, I mean...<br> He doesn't care about<br> this city the way we do.<br> I mean, how could he?<br> - This is how it happens isn't it, Pete?<br> - What's that?<br> Guy leans on the guy<br> and suddenly...<br> the whole town just<br> looks the other way.<br> Robby, Robby...<br> Look it...<br> Marty Baron is just<br> trying to make his mark.<br> He's gonna be here<br> for a couple of years...<br> and he's gonna move on,<br> just like he did in<br> New York and Miami.<br> Where are you gonna go?<br> Good night, Robby. Brian.<br> - Hey Pete?<br> - Yeah.<br> When we do run the story,<br> I'm gonna need a comment<br> from the Cardinal.<br> We'll talk again later.<br> Good night, Robby.<br> Good night, Pete.<br> Robby.<br> What?<br> No shit. When?<br> Ok. Yeah.<br> Hey...<br> What's up?<br> Sweeney ruled in our favor.<br> She ruled to<br> unseal the documents.<br> Jesus!<br> Church has already<br> filed an appeal...<br> but the trial Court of ruling...<br> is generally upheld<br> in this matters.<br> And when do we<br> get the documents?<br> Probably takes common<br> a few weeks to rule...<br> and then there's<br> a redaction process.<br> I'd say it would be made<br> public, mid January.<br> - Ok.<br> - Alright.<br> - Thanks Jon.<br> - You bet.<br> - Nice work.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Metro should run<br> something, Marty.<br> - We can't run this one big.<br> Why wouldn't we?<br> It's a major<br> First Amendment victory.<br> Not to mention you got<br> an Irish catholic Judge...<br> ruling against the Church.<br> - That's a hell of a precedent.<br> - We don't want the Herald<br> going deep on this.<br> Why is that?<br> - You're gonna have<br> to step out, Peter.<br> - I'm not stepping out.<br> Peter...<br> - When did you...?<br> - Couple of weeks ago.<br> Couple of weeks?<br> Yeah.<br> - And you're telling us now?<br> - These are substantial.<br> It clearly shows<br> that Law was negligent.<br> I need more time.<br> I wanna keep digging.<br> - For what? This is<br> the goddamn story.<br> It's not the whole story.<br> Tough shit, we're on<br> a clock now.<br> Even if we don't<br> run Sweeney's rulings...<br> another paper could find this<br> letters and fuck the story.<br> Agreed.<br> But we run these letters alone...<br> Law apologizes, says<br> it's one time thing...<br> and he can bury it.<br> How? This clearly<br> show he knew...<br> and did nothing about it.<br> Look, I'm close<br> to stories on 70 priests.<br> We nail that along<br> with those letters...<br> this is proof that this<br> is bigger than Law.<br> This is the whole system.<br> Your multiple sources...<br> confirming all those priests?<br> Some. I'll get more.<br> Too risky. If we're<br> not buttoned-up...<br> on every single one of them<br> the Church will pick us apart.<br> I think I can get us someone<br> from the other side of the isle.<br> - Somebody inside the Church?<br> - Yeah, a lawyer.<br> - Will he go on the record?<br> Deep background,<br> but he's a solid source.<br> Rezendes needs time<br> to write the story.<br> We don't want to drop<br> it on Christmass...<br> not after the 9/11.<br> We can run it just<br> after New Years.<br> Before they release<br> the rest of the documents.<br> Alright.<br> Tell Canellos to bury<br> the ruling in Metro.<br> - You got six weeks.<br> - Thank you.<br> Tell Mike I want<br> a draft by Christmass.<br> - And we need a response<br> from Lake Street. - Yeah.<br> Who does PR for the Cardinal?<br> Still John Walsh?<br> No, somebody new.<br> Donna Morrissey.<br> She came from TV.<br> She's young.<br> Good, get in quote. If we need<br> something from Law on...handed.<br> Robby, next time give me<br> a goddamn heads up.<br> Will do.<br> SPECIAL REPOR SPOTLIGHT ARTICLE #1 - GEOGHAN LETTERS.<br> Almost alway, his victims<br> were grammar school boys.<br> One was 4 years old.<br> You have 21 days and<br> 4 hours until deadline<br> ...that Church officials<br> never told him why...<br> You have 8 days and<br> 2 hours until deadline<br> ...Three years later,<br> Geoghan was still...<br> Where are we on your source?<br> It's time. Ben<br> Robby, what a nice surprise.<br> Come on in.<br> Hey hun... Look who<br> I found outside.<br> Karen, can you<br> give us a minute?<br> - Sure.<br> - Good to see you, Karen.<br> What's up?<br> I'm out of time, Jim.<br> We got cover-up stories<br> on 70 priests.<br> But the boss is<br> not gonna run it...<br> unless I got confirmation<br> from your side.<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> C'mon. This is<br> our town, Jimmy.<br> Everybody knew<br> something was going on.<br> And no one did a thing.<br> We got to put<br> an end to it.<br> Don't tell me<br> what I got to do.<br> Yeah, I helped<br> defend this scumbags,<br> but that's my job, Robby.<br> I was doing my job!<br> Yeah.<br> You were never one of us.<br> Get out of my house.<br> Hey!<br> You come to my home and<br> lay this shit on me?<br> You were right, Robby.<br> We all knew<br> something was going on.<br> So where were you?<br> What took you so long?<br> I don't know, Jim.<br> Give me the list.<br> Larry, we're gonna<br> press in 6 hours.<br> Donna Morrissey says she calls<br> with quote from Law hours ago.<br> - That's what I thought.<br> - Where did you talk to her?<br> - Ok, Ok, bye.<br> - Yeah, yeah that's<br> good to know.<br> - Thanks Pete.<br> - Anything?<br> Conley said that Donna Morrissey<br> should have called,<br> he just left Lake Street.<br> Yeah. Resky said<br> the same thing.<br> This si ridiculous.<br> You think they wanna<br> get ahead on this.<br> I mean they be<br> idiots not to.<br> I would love to see their faces<br> when they read this thing man.<br> You know Sunday is the feast<br> to the epiphaney?<br> Seems appropriate.<br> Mike Rezendes.<br> Hey Donna.<br> Thanks for calling.<br> Yeah. I just had a few questions<br> if you have a minute.<br> What?<br> - Other adjective.<br> - Anything?<br> - Law just turned us down.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> - I just got of the phone<br> with Donna Morrissey...<br> she said, quote<br> "we don't even want...<br> to know what<br> the questions are".<br> - End quote.<br> - Did she really said that?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, that oughta do it.<br> The Church had no<br> interests in knowing...<br> what the Globe's<br> questions would be.<br> Work it in somewhere before<br> the jam. Anything else?<br> Matt wants to put the letters<br> online, so that the readers...<br> can see for themselves.<br> We can run the URL at<br> the bottom of the article ...<br> - it's pretty straightforward.<br> - Ok.<br> We also put the Spotlight tip<br> line at the end of the story...<br> so people can call in.<br> It goes directly<br> to our office.<br> Matt and I can go<br> in the morning...<br> in case we get any calls.<br> I'm more concerned about<br> the phones at reception.<br> After we ran the Porter case...<br> the message center<br> were tight up for weeks.<br> That's a real problem.<br> They would take at us too.<br> Lots of them.<br> I'll talk to Richard about<br> the security and the phones.<br> How are we coming<br> on the follow story?<br> Well we've now done multiple<br> stories on 70 priests.<br> All 70?<br> And with confirmation<br> from Robby's source...<br> we are ready to go.<br> We can have a drive next week.<br> Robby, that source of yours,<br> is it something<br> we could revisit?<br> It might be tough.<br> But he has no problem helping...<br> the Church protect<br> dozens of dirty priests.<br> - Guy is a scumbag.<br> - He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.<br> - He's a show for the Church.<br> - He knew and he did nothing.<br> He could have said something<br> years ago. Maybe save some lives.<br> What about us?<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - We had all the pieces.<br> - Why didn't we get it sooner?<br> - We didn't have all the pieces.<br> We had Saviano, we had Barrett,<br> we had Geoghan.<br> We had the directories<br> in the basement.<br> - You know what,<br> we got it now.<br> - Robby, this story<br> needed Spotlight.<br> - Mike, Spotlight's been<br> around since 1970.<br> So what? We couldn't see...<br> the scope of this.<br> No one could.<br> Robby, this started<br> with one goddamn priest.<br> Macleish sent us a letter<br> of 20 priests years ago.<br> Sacha found a clip.<br> Are you kidding, 20 priests?<br> When?<br> Just after Porter,<br> december '93.<br> I buried the story<br> in Metro. No follow.<br> That was you?<br> You were Metro?<br> Yeah. That was me.<br> I just didn't know and<br> I don't remember at all.<br> But yeah.<br> Can I... Say something here?<br> Sometimes it's<br> easy to forget...<br> that we spend<br> most of our time...<br> stumbling around the dark.<br> Suddenly a light<br> gets turned on and...<br> there's a fair share<br> of blame to go around.<br> I can't speak<br> to what happened...<br> before I arrived, but...<br> All of you have done some<br> very good reporting here.<br> Reporting that I<br> believe is gonna have...<br> an immediate and<br> considerable impact...<br> on our readers.<br> For me... This kind of<br> story is why we do this.<br> Having said that,<br> Cardinal Law and...<br> the catholic community<br> are gonna have ...<br> a very strong<br> response to this.<br> So if you need a moment,<br> you've earned it.<br> But, I will need you back here<br> monday morning, focused...<br> and ready to do your job.<br> - Leaving?<br> - Yeah.<br> I... just got a<br> call from Cardinal.<br> Really? Why?<br> He wanted to tell me personally<br> they decided not to comment and...<br> said he wanted<br> to extend the courtesy.<br> Jesus, the balls on that guy.<br> What did you say?<br> I told him he was making mistake<br> and that we're gonna run the story.<br> Damn right we're gonna run it.<br> Sacha, can I have<br> a drink of water?<br> Yeah, sure nana. Yeah.<br> Can I keep this?<br> Sure.<br> I thought you<br> should see it first.<br> Thank you for bringing it by.<br> Now I have some plans<br> I have to attend to.<br> Both kids were abused.<br> Jamaica Plain two weeks ago.<br> Keep... Doing your<br> work, Mr. Rezendes.<br> Hello!<br> How are you guys doing?<br> Good...<br> Church allowed abuse<br> by priest for years<br> - Hey.<br> - Good morning.<br> - How did you sleep?<br> - Not very well.
