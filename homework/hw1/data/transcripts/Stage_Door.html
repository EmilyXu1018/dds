                        - Do you have to do that?<br> - Pipe down.<br> - Get that customer, Hattie.<br> - Lf that's for me, I'm in.<br> - Hello?<br> - Is it for me?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Miss Judy?<br> Miss Judy.<br> It's yours, Judy.<br> - Hello, Hags.<br> - Hello.<br> Look what mother<br> sent me from Louisiana.<br> - What are they?<br> - Pecans.<br> Pecans? Let's open one.<br> Maybe there's a check in it.<br> I had a date but I guess I can get out of it.<br> - Sure. I'll get a girl.<br> - Where is she?<br> - Okay. Who?<br> - Not you.<br> - Come on. Take them off.<br> - Are you speaking to me?<br> You heard what I said.<br> Take off those stockings or I will and...<br> What do you mean?<br> But they're my stockings.<br> They are not. If you think I'm going<br> to give up my lunch to buy you stockings...<br> You owe me a pair anyway.<br> Mrs. Orcutt, Linda's doing a striptease!<br> You can get a bigger crowd on the streets.<br> Why don't you split them?<br> A stocking apiece.<br> From now on, you wear<br> your own stockings or go barelegged.<br> The places you go,<br> it doesn't make any difference.<br> What's the trouble?<br> Are you running a theatrical<br> boarding house or a gymnasium?<br> What's going on here?<br> She accused me<br> of stealing my own stockings.<br> She's swiped her last pair of stockings<br> from me.<br> How do I run a respectable house...<br> You're doing the best you can.<br> I won't be insulted<br> by this little guttersnipe.<br> I'll guttersnipe you!<br> I will not have that in my house.<br> I wish you girls would find some way...<br> to settle your differences.<br> I'll slap her ears<br> flat against the back of her head.<br> - I'd like to see you try.<br> - Come on down here.<br> I wouldn't room with her if you paid me to.<br> Good! That's the best news I've had<br> in the past year.<br> I'm moving in with Madeline right away.<br> It shouldn't take you very long.<br> Everything you own is on your back!<br> If this barroom brawl is over...<br> When I get back to my room,<br> you're all I want to find missing.<br> Heavens, no! At the Footlights Club?<br> Nothing exciting ever happens here.<br> I knew it.<br> Do you want a date?<br> I said, do you want a date?<br> With more of those lumbermen?<br> Am I supposed to apologize<br> for being born in Seattle?<br> The last couple we went stepping with<br> were made of lumber.<br> - Especially their feet.<br> - All right.<br> You can stay here<br> and gorge yourself on lamb stew again.<br> - Pat, want a date?<br> - Wait a minute. Is it for dinner?<br> Why didn't you say so before you spoke?<br> That lamb stew<br> has got me counting sheep at night.<br> You're not so particular<br> about my friends when it's for dinner.<br> They can't step on you<br> when you're sitting down.<br> And you might try being<br> just a little less insulting this time.<br> Me? Insulting to a lumberman?<br> Why, the very idea is preposterous.<br> - Do we dress?<br> - I suppose so. We usually do.<br> I'll be there, my pet.<br> You know me, the lumbermars delight.<br> Mr. Powell's car is waiting for Miss Shaw.<br> - I'll tell her.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Is that for Linda?<br> - Mr. Powell's car.<br> Wait a minute. I'll be the carrier pigeon.<br> Linda! Mr. Powell's car is here!<br> Mr. Powell isn't here! Just his car!<br> Peaceful little haven we have here.<br> Anybody use a couple of<br> tired Tyrolean peasants?<br> - I'll take a couple on toast.<br> - I'll take mine dry.<br> - How was the matine?<br> - Very intimate.<br> We had 100 people on the stage<br> and 50 in the audience.<br> - But you had them outnumbered.<br> - The whole thing makes me sick.<br> What's Gerta sick about?<br> - Five weeks' rehearsal. Two weeks' pay.<br> - What's the matter? Is the show closing?<br> - Like a tired clam.<br> - That's a shame.<br> That's too bad.<br> Let's all go on relief and get it over with.<br> - What would that be?<br> - Mice.<br> How do you get in here?<br> - You might blast!<br> - What?<br> - We don't want any fish!<br> - Go around to the other door!<br> Can't you read?<br> Did you hear that? Another show folding.<br> If they keep on closing, we can move<br> into the storehouse with the scenery.<br> You said it.<br> - Hattie, the mice are back.<br> - Don't go away, taxi.<br> How many doors are there to this place?<br> There's the trap door, the humidor,<br> and the cuspidor.<br> - How many doors would you like?<br> - I only asked a simple question.<br> Did you wish to see Mrs. Orcutt...<br> I want to see whoever I have to<br> about accommodations.<br> Which keeper's on duty today, Hattie?<br> Evidently, you're a very amusing person.<br> If you'll sit over there, I'll get Mrs. Orcutt.<br> She's in the kitchen.<br> Thanks.<br> If you young ladies will pardon me,<br> I shall take the wolfhounds...<br> for a stroll through the park.<br> Need I remind you<br> that Mr. Powell's car awaits without?<br> Maybe if you spoke a little louder<br> next time, everyone could hear you.<br> I'm sorry. I forget that you're old and deaf.<br> If you were more considerate<br> of your elders...<br> maybe Mr. Powell would send his car<br> for you someday.<br> I can hardly wait.<br> He would probably take one look at you...<br> and send you right back.<br> But you have to expect that.<br> Is that so?<br> I could fix you up<br> with Mr. Powell's chauffeur.<br> He has a very nice car, too.<br> But Mr. Powell's chauffeur doesn't go<br> as far in his car as Mr. Powell does.<br> Even a chauffeur has to have an incentive.<br> You should know.<br> I hope you enjoy your lamb stew<br> again tonight.<br> I'll be thinking of you<br> while dining on pheasant bordelaise.<br> Bordelaise, no less! Girls, listen!<br> Or maybe it's casserole.<br> I'm not quite certain.<br> Be sure not to eat the bones<br> and give yourself away.<br> Did you wish to see me?<br> This is a theatrical boarding house,<br> isn't it?<br> - It's considered one of the finest.<br> - I was in doubt for a moment.<br> Are you the person I see<br> about accommodations?<br> Accommodations? Yes, indeed!<br> I hope you'll pardon my appearance.<br> We've had a little trouble in the kitchen.<br> I'll just try and see what's available.<br> - Let's see. Ann and Mary, they room...<br> - I'd like a room with a private bath.<br> Is there anything strange in that request?<br> You mustrt mind the girls.<br> They're just full of fun.<br> We're like one great big family.<br> I may not be able to give you<br> just what you want...<br> but I can put you in a room<br> with a very charming girl, temporarily.<br> That is, until we get a vacancy.<br> How expensive are your rooms?<br> They're $13 if you share a room with a girl.<br> It depends.<br> That seems rather high.<br> Isn't there some reduction by the week?<br> It is $13 a week.<br> - My mistake.<br> - That doesn't include luncheon.<br> The meals go with the $13?<br> Yes, indeed, and I must say<br> we have a very lovely kitchen.<br> I'm sorry. I haven't any change.<br> That's all right.<br> I expect to be here quite a while.<br> What shall I do about my baggage?<br> It's in the taxi.<br> Will you tell Frank to get Miss...<br> - Randall. Terry Randall.<br> ...Randall's baggage out of the taxi?<br> Pardon me. Mrs. Orcutt...<br> has Mr. Hargraves<br> of the guild called me yet?<br> - Why, no.<br> - When he does call...<br> tell him I've read his play<br> and I can't consider it.<br> It is far too trivial. I couldn't consider...<br> - How do you do?<br> - Miss Luther, this is Miss Randall.<br> - She's going to be with us for a while.<br> - How nice.<br> - Are you in the theater?<br> - Not yet, but I hope to be.<br> With proper coaching,<br> there's no reason to despair. L...<br> - lf you'll just come with me.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> Here are your trunks.<br> Take them up to Miss Maitland's room.<br> What's that?<br> That's one of the features<br> of the Footlights Club.<br> It's the chair Bernardt sat in...<br> when she was rehearsing Queen Elizabeth<br> over here.<br> - I was in the company.<br> - You were an actress?<br> Mrs. Orcutt's played with all the stars.<br> She's supported me in lots of my shows,<br> haven't you, dear?<br> That's Bernardt's picture, isn't it?<br> They say she was wonderful.<br> She was very good,<br> very good in some things.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> although it isn't generally known...<br> Bernardt and I had the same coach.<br> I think coaching's a waste of time.<br> After all, acting's only common sense.<br> But that's all a good coach applies,<br> is common sense.<br> If I don't get the right play soon,<br> I may do a little coaching myself.<br> What is this, another boat docking?<br> Mrs. Orcutt told me to put this here.<br> But this is not the storeroom.<br> You'll like this room. Really, you will.<br> Jean, this is your new roommate.<br> Miss Randall, Miss Maitland.<br> We've met before, after a fashion.<br> Jears a very lively girl.<br> I'm quite sure<br> you'll get on very well together.<br> I'm sure of that.<br> - Lf there's anything you want...<br> - No. I'll be all right, I hope.<br> When does your baggage get here?<br> I'm expecting the bulk of it in the morning.<br> We could leave the trunks here<br> and sleep in the hall.<br> There's no use crowding the trunks.<br> I don't know what we're going to do<br> when the wolfhounds arrive.<br> - I hope you don't mind animals.<br> - Not at all.<br> I've roomed with many of them before.<br> Yes, I can see that.<br> - Fresh kill?<br> - Yes. I trap them myself.<br> - Do you mind if I ask a personal question?<br> - Another one?<br> Are these trunks full of bodies?<br> Just those,<br> but I don't intend to unpack them.<br> I was just thinking<br> if the room got too crowded...<br> we could live in the trunks.<br> Yes, that's a good idea.<br> You don't mind helping me unpack?<br> I beg your pardon.<br> You're not the maid, are you?<br> That's quite all right.<br> What a lovely dress.<br> Whipped up at home by loving hands?<br> Every stitch.<br> - Do you cook, too?<br> - Nothing fancy. Just plain home cooking.<br> I'll bet you could boil<br> a terrific pan of water.<br> I imagine that half that bureau's mine.<br> You don't mind if I put this here, do you?<br> Why not? Help scare the moths away.<br> A friend of the family?<br> Happens to be my grandfather.<br> Grandfather?<br> There is quite a family resemblance,<br> especially around the whiskers.<br> That's a fairly intelligent observation<br> for you.<br> I must say, he's a fairly generous old guy,<br> as grandfathers go.<br> He always treated me very well.<br> I suppose if you'd had your choice...<br> you'd have picked<br> a much younger grandfather.<br> I see that in addition to your charms,<br> you have that insolence...<br> generated by an inferior upbringing.<br> Fancy clothes, fancy language,<br> and everything.<br> Unfortunately, I learned<br> to speak English correctly.<br> It won't be much use to you here.<br> We all talk pig Latin.<br> And I use the right knife and fork.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> All you need is the knife.<br> Do you mind if I hang these things here?<br> Temporarily, of course.<br> - I must take my bath.<br> - That might help.<br> And remember,<br> half the wardrobe is yours...<br> and if anything of mine should get<br> in the way, just toss it out the window.<br> Did you get a load of that hat?<br> I expected a rabbit<br> to jump out any minute.<br> I thought old Orcutt would fall over<br> in a faint when she handed her that $50.<br> If she had a $50 bill,<br> what's she doing here?<br> It must have been counterfeit.<br> There's no such thing as a $50 bill.<br> I think she's as phony as that bill.<br> - I must have missed some fun.<br> - I'll say you did.<br> When she asked<br> if the meals went with the $13...<br> I thought I'd bust a ligament.<br> Maybe she's a social worker<br> doing a little slumming.<br> - She picked the right place.<br> - Speaking of slum, when do we eat?<br> Wash your necks, children.<br> The lamb's about to be sacrificed.<br> - I should worry. Tonight's lumber night.<br> - I washed my neck yesterday.<br> - So did I.<br> - I refuse to wash my neck for lamb stew.<br> Here's Kay!<br> - Hello.<br> - Any luck today?<br> No, but I've got great news.<br> I actually saw one manager.<br> The whole towrs underwater!<br> Kay saw a manager!<br> - Was it much of an interview?<br> - It wasrt an interview.<br> I just saw him<br> as he rushed out of his office.<br> At least you know there is such an animal.<br> What'd he look like?<br> Like any other animal.<br> He had on pants, tie, and collar...<br> - Did he have hoofs?<br> - Smoke come out of his nose?<br> - That's what gets in your eyes.<br> - Did he say "mama"...<br> - when you squeezed him?<br> - I didn't get that close.<br> You didn't see a manager.<br> What you saw was a mirage.<br> Come and get it!<br> Let's go.<br> Come on, Henry. Mother'll get you<br> some of that lovely lamb stew.<br> Maybe there's a mouse in it.<br> - Coming, Kay?<br> - I'll be along a little later.<br> - Arert you having dinner?<br> - I'm not very hungry.<br> You've been awfully blue lately,<br> haven't you?<br> After playing a whole season<br> in Powell's outer office...<br> he might at least have said hello.<br> It gets pretty discouraging once in a while,<br> but I guess it's all in the game.<br> - Miss Hamilton.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Orcutt.<br> - I'm afraid I must...<br> - I know what you're going to say.<br> If you could let it go a bit longer...<br> You know the rules,<br> and it's three weeks now.<br> I've practically been promised a part<br> and I'm not eating any meals here...<br> You're putting me<br> in a very embarrassing position.<br> I don't want to be inconsiderate.<br> Maybe I could give you<br> a little money on account.<br> - Say $10?<br> - That's something.<br> Thanks awfully.<br> Hey there, Ella!<br> - That's still a community tub.<br> - I'll be out in a minute.<br> You've been in there a half hour.<br> You think you're a trained seal?<br> What'd you say?<br> If you want to drown yourself,<br> why don't you use the ocean?<br> Kay!<br> - Why didn't you say hello to me?<br> - Hello, Jean.<br> I didn't see you.<br> - You certainly couldn't help but hear me.<br> - Don't pay any attention to me.<br> - My mind's been wandering lately.<br> - What's the matter?<br> It's just one of those days.<br> - Let's sit down and have a good cry.<br> - All right.<br> You can cry on my shoulder.<br> I'm going to go bathe anyhow.<br> There's no casting today.<br> "Leave your name and telephone number<br> and we'll get in touch with you later.<br> "Mr. Powell isn't seeing anyone<br> until the end of the week."<br> Last week and the week before,<br> and the week before that.<br> Where did I ever get the idea<br> that I was a good actress?<br> Say, who got all those rave notices<br> a year ago?<br> Yeah, but that was a year ago.<br> - Boy, you do sound gloomy.<br> - I don't know why I'm hanging on.<br> Except there's nothing else I can do<br> and no one I can go back to.<br> Except someone I'll never go back to.<br> Listen, you don't have<br> to go back to anybody.<br> You're the best actress in this whole club.<br> Something good's bound<br> to be coming your way.<br> I hope so...<br> but it had better be soon.<br> I don't mean to be butting into<br> your private affairs...<br> but if it's a matter of a few bucks,<br> I'd be very...<br> Jean, I've got to get<br> that part in Enchanted April.<br> It's been my whole life.<br> It's me. No one else can play that part.<br> It belongs to me.<br> Jean, I've got to get that part! I've got to.<br> Honey, don't cry.<br> - That's all there is.<br> - That's what I call a dinner fit for a king.<br> If you don't care what you say.<br> - I've got most of it caught in my teeth.<br> - Now I know why sheepherders go crazy.<br> It's the lamb stew.<br> If your cat ever turns up missing<br> around dinnertime...<br> I'm eating out that night.<br> I bet Orcutt's husband<br> died of wool poisoning.<br> Coffee tastes of iodine.<br> They should serve bandages, too.<br> It would make a good liniment.<br> I can't tell you how interested I was...<br> in your discussion of Twelfth Night.<br> - It was so intelligent.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> I'm afraid that the rest of the inmates<br> didn't share your enthusiasm.<br> Barbarians.<br> They've had no training, my dear.<br> - Why, when I played in Twelfth Night...<br> - Did you play in Twelfth Night?<br> Yes! I...<br> I've a few of my notices here<br> if you'd care to see them.<br> I'd love to.<br> How lucky. They're right on top.<br> Now, don't read them all,<br> just the bits that are underlined.<br> And this one's from Atlantic City.<br> I don't like to gossip...<br> but that new gal seems<br> to have an awful crush on Shakespeare.<br> I wouldn't be surprised if they got married.<br> - You're fooling. Shakespeare's dead.<br> - No!<br> If he's the same one who wrote Hamlet,<br> he is.<br> Never heard of it.<br> - Certainly you must have heard of Hamlet.<br> - I meet so many people.<br> Hang on to your chairs, girls.<br> We're going to get<br> another load of Shakespeare.<br> Is it against the rules of the house<br> to discuss the classics?<br> No. Go right ahead.<br> I won't take my sleeping pill tonight.<br> It might interest you girls to know...<br> that all great actresses<br> knew their Shakespeare.<br> How about their onions?<br> I fail to see what onions have to do<br> with Shakespeare.<br> If you'd listen to Miss Randall,<br> you might learn something.<br> I like Amos 'rAndy.<br> In my day, we were not only actresses,<br> we were technicians.<br> We learned our trade from the ground up.<br> That's what we should have, a trade.<br> - I want to be a Swiss bell ringer.<br> - I want to do something with my hands.<br> - Sit on them.<br> - You'd get further with your feet.<br> The trouble with you is,<br> you're all trying to be comics.<br> Don't you take anything seriously?<br> After you've sat around<br> for a year trying to get a job...<br> you won't take anything seriously either.<br> Do you have to just sit around<br> and do nothing about it?<br> Maybe it's in the blood.<br> My grandfather sat around till he was 80.<br> My grandfather didn't,<br> and if he and a lot of others...<br> hadrt crossed the country<br> in a covered wagon...<br> there'd still be Indians living in Wichita.<br> Who do you think is living there now?<br> You think you're facing difficulties.<br> What do you think of the men<br> who crossed the Rockies?<br> Did any of them ever try to crash<br> a manager's office?<br> No, but if they'd wanted to,<br> I'm sure they could have...<br> and I bet I can, too.<br> Maybe she can get through the door<br> with vanishing cream.<br> Come on. We'll be late again.<br> The Edelweiss girls must be off.<br> If we're not on the stage by 8:30,<br> the orchestra gets Ionesome.<br> Stop it!<br> Can't we ever<br> have any peace around here?<br> Quiet! Olga wants peace!<br> - Peace at any price!<br> - You can't have peace without a war.<br> You sound very superior.<br> What have you ever done in the theater?<br> Everything but burst out of a pie<br> at a Rotarian banquet.<br> You talk as though<br> the world owed you a living.<br> Maybe if you tried to do something<br> for the theater...<br> the theater would do something for you.<br> - What theater?<br> - Is there a theater?<br> I don't know. Has anybody<br> looked up the side streets lately?<br> It doesn't seem to me that any of you<br> take your work very seriously.<br> Now that you're here, we're giving up.<br> At least I will try.<br> If I can act, I want the world to know it.<br> If I can't, I want to know it.<br> Even your best friends won't tell you.<br> It would be a great innovation<br> if your mind...<br> could stretch further<br> than the next wisecrack.<br> I tried that once,<br> but it didn't snap back into place.<br> Miss Randall's right.<br> All you girls want training.<br> - In my day...<br> - When knighthood was in flower.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I'm sorry. I was just reading aloud.<br> Miss Canfield.<br> - Who will we pick on now?<br> - Don't pick on me.<br> - Miss Judy!<br> - Do I hear males?<br> - My lumber gentlemen. No cracks.<br> - Sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.<br> How do you do, Mr. Dukenfield?<br> Nice to see you again.<br> I manage to get down once a year.<br> - Meet Mr. Milbanks.<br> - How do you do?<br> I've known this little gal<br> since she was that high, in pigtails.<br> - Let's skip that.<br> - Yeah.<br> In those days, nobody ever thought<br> that Pete Jones' daughter...<br> would be an actress.<br> - The odds are still the same.<br> - Yeah.<br> Say, have you got a friend?<br> I have a charming girl for you.<br> Here she is now.<br> Jean, I'd like you to meet<br> a couple of friends of mine.<br> I thought you said they were dressing.<br> Don't start anything here.<br> I'll rinse your bag.<br> - Why didn't they wear their overalls?<br> - Did she say that? Cut it out.<br> Jean, I'd like you to meet Mr. Dukenfield<br> and Mr. Milstream.<br> - Milbank.<br> - What'd I say?<br> Milstream.<br> What do you do,<br> tear down the trees with your bare hands?<br> - I told you she was a kick.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I love a sense of humor.<br> - Yes, I can tell by the size of your shoes.<br> - What?<br> - Ain't she a card?<br> Yeah!<br> You come from Seattle, too, don't you?<br> - Yeah. How did you know?<br> - You can always tell a college man.<br> - I got a taxi waiting outside.<br> - Let's get going.<br> Imagine that, Judy! A taxi!<br> I'll bet you drink champagne<br> out of slippers.<br> - I never have.<br> - Let's go to Central Park.<br> There are trees. We can hang by our tails,<br> eat coconuts.<br> You're killing me.<br> Pleasant little foursome.<br> I predict a hatchet murder<br> before the night's over.<br> - Hello.<br> - How are all your folks?<br> What happened to you?<br> - Nearly everything.<br> - You're limping.<br> Am I? So I am.<br> Did you ever dance<br> with one of those Seattle Romeos?<br> Maybe. I don't remember.<br> - Lf you did, you'd remember it, all right.<br> - Why do you go out with them?<br> I'll bite. Why do I?<br> They not only jump on you,<br> but they bore you to death.<br> I know how many cords of wood<br> there are in a pint...<br> that a pine tree is not deciduous,<br> but has acidosis or something...<br> that the Oregon timberline<br> is receding so fast...<br> that in another 1,000 years or so,<br> the whole state will be practically bald.<br> What am I telling you all this for?<br> Why not?<br> We're going to share the same room.<br> Why not share our troubles?<br> We started off on the wrong foot.<br> Let's stay that way.<br> Don't you ever get tired of quarreling?<br> - What's the matter? Can't you take it?<br> - I can take it if you want it that way.<br> Would you mind if I asked you<br> a very humble question?<br> If you ask it in English.<br> What do you do about air in this room?<br> In the summertime,<br> we do without it entirely.<br> This time of year,<br> we usually open the windows.<br> This thing is stuck.<br> Don't pull it down from the top!<br> We'll have the whole upper floor<br> in our laps.<br> What do we do about the sign?<br> Just leave it there.<br> Don't those blinking lights<br> keep you awake?<br> They will if you lie there<br> and try to out-blink them.<br> We usually use these.<br> What do I do with this?<br> Put it over my eyes?<br> No. You swallow it with a glass of water.<br> That's a very ingenious idea. Thanks.<br> Don't get sentimental.<br> Do you go to sleep right away?<br> Sure, what do you go to bed for?<br> - I thought we might talk.<br> - I've had enough talk for one evening.<br> I suppose you're wondering<br> why I'm living here.<br> Maybe I am.<br> Why don't you sell some of those clothes...<br> and live in a decent place?<br> - Isn't this a decent place?<br> - No.<br> Besides, I've always longed<br> to live in an atmosphere like this.<br> My pet, you haven't seen atmosphere.<br> Wait till about 5:00 in the morning...<br> when those garbage trucks start around.<br> Am I getting good,<br> or are you getting weak?<br> - No. That just struck me as funny.<br> - It isn't very funny to me.<br> If I had your clothes,<br> I'd scram out of here plenty fast...<br> and leave you here with your atmosphere.<br> No, you wouldn't.<br> You bark a lot, but you don't bite.<br> You wouldn't sell out for a wardrobe.<br> It's all right for you to talk.<br> You've got yours.<br> Linda isn't doing so bad, either.<br> Linda? The other girl you fight with.<br> One of them. I don't know.<br> Maybe you two girls<br> have got the right idea.<br> What idea is that?<br> Stop kidding.<br> You mean having a grandfather.<br> Call him whatever you like.<br> If I had to do it all over again,<br> I wouldn't have a grandfather.<br> Says you.<br> Who's in a better position to give advice...<br> than a woman who allows her grandfather<br> to buy her clothes?<br> What'd you say?<br> - I said, who's in a better position...<br> - Never mind.<br> Write it on a piece of paper<br> and I'll read it in the morning.<br> Down. Up, two, three.<br> Tilt.<br> - Snap the heads over there.<br> - All right.<br> That's enough for today. Go to home.<br> - I thought he'd never call a time-out.<br> - We ought to get him a whip.<br> Get me a wheelchair.<br> Let's run through our routine<br> before Olga gets away.<br> If I'm going to dance any more,<br> you'd better dash home...<br> and get my extra pair of legs.<br> Why not quit running around with<br> those lumberjacks and get some sleep?<br> Will you run through our routine?<br> When am I going to get time<br> for my concert practice?<br> Be a good girl, and when we're famous,<br> we'll buy you a lollipop.<br> All right.<br> - And for this I studied with Kolijinsky.<br> - Come on.<br> Tony Powell. How are you?<br> - Hello, Alex. How's the new school?<br> - Fine. Glad you came up.<br> Thinking of putting on a musical?<br> I probably won't produce anything<br> unless I find an angel.<br> - You haven't seen any flying around here?<br> - No, not lately.<br> Hit it, Olga.<br> Who's the little blonde?<br> Just one of the kids. Want to meet her?<br> Never mind. I'll introduce myself.<br> Look who's giving us the once-over.<br> - Where?<br> - Over there.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Nobody but Anthony Powell.<br> So that's Linda's soul mate.<br> Who's he staring at?<br> I don't know, but I hope it's me.<br> You can have him.<br> You girls rehearsing for a musical?<br> No. We're just getting over the DTs.<br> - Nice routine you've got there.<br> - I hear yours isn't so bad, either.<br> We haven't come to the best part of it yet.<br> What's the matter with your girlfriend?<br> I think she's kind of nervous, you know...<br> meeting a great man like you.<br> - Do I make you nervous, too?<br> - A little.<br> But I wouldn't admit that to you.<br> You two kids expect to go on the stage?<br> We're just sort of hoofing it around.<br> Waiting for someone to discover us.<br> You're discovered.<br> I didn't mean it that way.<br> It's just that we're waiting...<br> for a nightclub engagement.<br> - Something like the Grotto.<br> - The Grotto.<br> I think you'd better excuse me.<br> You are making me a little nervous.<br> Excuse me.<br> You know, there's nothing like<br> a cheerful letter from home.<br> Pa got laid off.<br> My sister's husband has left her.<br> One of my brothers slugged<br> a railroad detective.<br> I guess that's all.<br> "Lots of love, and can you spare $50?"<br> How'd you like<br> that vegetable soup tonight?<br> If it were a little thicker,<br> it would've made nice hot water.<br> If she serves it again,<br> I'll bring a bar of soap...<br> and wash out a few stockings.<br> She must have gotten that meatloaf<br> from the Smithsonian Institute.<br> - I wonder what was in it.<br> - I don't want to know.<br> By way of variety,<br> let's complain about the food.<br> If you werert snooty,<br> you could have had a dinner date tonight.<br> You can have my share<br> of those timber wolves.<br> Timber wolves to you,<br> but to me they're meat and potatoes.<br> Don't you know any younger men?<br> I'm tired of buying dinners<br> for younger men.<br> She needs a good bawling out.<br> - Don't start that again.<br> - Start what?<br> We were rehearsing our routine today...<br> and who should walk up to us<br> but Tony Powell.<br> - So what?<br> - Not the great Anthony Powell?<br> He was very pleasant to us,<br> even wanted to know all about us.<br> And she runs out on him<br> like he was a bed of poison ivy.<br> I didn't like the way he looked at me.<br> You should be glad he looked at you at all.<br> He makes you feel like you ought<br> to run home and put on a tin overcoat.<br> Listen, I'm part of this team...<br> and if you think I'm practicing<br> just to flee from managers...<br> - you're crazy!<br> - You're interfering with my art.<br> He wasrt looking for an act.<br> He was putting one on.<br> You ought to stop at a filling station<br> and get pumped up.<br> She ain't exactly a flat, dearie,<br> just a slow leak.<br> If it's not food, it's men.<br> Can't you talk about anything else?<br> And what else is there?<br> - Hiya, Kay. What have you got? A script?<br> - Yes.<br> Don't you eat here anymore,<br> you lucky girl?<br> Some friends of mine are in town...<br> and I've been seeing<br> quite a bit of them lately.<br> Not some of those tree-chopper-downers,<br> I hope?<br> No. Just people.<br> Pardon me,<br> but there's a dust storm blowing up.<br> How do you do?<br> - Have we met socially?<br> - I hope not.<br> That's a good-Iooking piece<br> of jackrabbit you got there.<br> It's just a little trinket<br> my Aunt Susan sent over.<br> I think it's unselfish of those animals<br> to give up their lives...<br> to keep other animals warm.<br> They're smart animals. They never give up<br> their lives for the wrong people.<br> You understand the rodent family<br> much better than I do.<br> Incidentally,<br> I saw your Aunt Susan today...<br> and I think you show much better taste<br> than he does.<br> You can think of a bright remark<br> while I answer the telephone.<br> Don't forget Aunt Susars car<br> is waiting for you outside.<br> Hello? This is Miss Maitland speaking.<br> Yes?<br> Mr. Burger? At the Club Grotto?<br> Where? When?<br> Okay. I'll go right over.<br> Thanks ever so much.<br> Call out the Marines, kids!<br> The Depressiors over!<br> What's the matter? Are you going screwy?<br> Come on, string bean!<br> Wake up? Let's get going.<br> That was Gordon from the dancing school.<br> What did he do, propose?<br> No. He said for us to go<br> over to the Club Grotto...<br> and see a man named Burger.<br> He's got an opening in his floorshow.<br> Good there is no opening in the floor.<br> You'd fall in.<br> - What's the excitement?<br> - I'm a stranger here myself.<br> She hasn't worked in so long,<br> if she gets the job...<br> it'll practically amount to a comeback.<br> They never seem to be at a loss for action.<br> It's a little like a three-ring circus.<br> - A little bit.<br> - They're a great bunch of girls.<br> I think so.<br> They don't seem to feel the same way<br> about me, though.<br> You mustrt mind them.<br> I'm beginning to feel that there's<br> something definitely wrong with me.<br> You're different, that's all.<br> Why? I eat the same food,<br> I sleep in the same kind of bed...<br> I've even got a crease across my back<br> from that lumpy mattress...<br> and I'm doing my best to pick up<br> their slang, though I'm not so hot.<br> How's that? "Not so hot."<br> They'll get to understand you<br> after a while.<br> - Maybe you'll get to understand them...<br> - I suppose so.<br> They do make a lot of noise,<br> but it's just to keep up their courage...<br> and hide their fears.<br> What have they got to be afraid of?<br> Certainly they're young enough<br> to have courage.<br> Young enough to have fears, too.<br> You saw how excited Jean and Ann got<br> just now, and that wasrt a job, even...<br> just the prospect of one.<br> You don't know what it means,<br> waiting, hoping...<br> that some manager will interview you.<br> At least you don't have that worry.<br> I saw you in that play last year.<br> You know you're a good actress.<br> I'm not so sure anymore.<br> How do you know<br> who's an actress and who isn't?<br> You're an actress if you're acting...<br> but you can't just walk up and down<br> a room and act.<br> Without that job and those lines to say,<br> an actress is just like any ordinary girl...<br> trying not to look as scared as she feels.<br> Here's something I dashed off<br> in the kitchen I want you to try.<br> - But I've had my dinner.<br> - But this is something extra special.<br> I'm practicing cooking in my spare time.<br> I'm glad that someone in that kitchen<br> is practicing.<br> I'll just leave it there.<br> You may get hungry after a while.<br> If I don't hear any screams,<br> I'll know I'm a success.<br> - Coming.<br> - I told you to wash those dishes.<br> Why do you do things like that?<br> - So that's final?<br> - Yes, Dad, that's final.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought by now you might have satisfied<br> this silly whim of yours...<br> and been ready to come back home.<br> If I thought that I couldn't<br> achieve anything by myself...<br> without the aid of the family millions...<br> - I'd be a pretty sorry specimen.<br> - Why must it be the stage?<br> There are other things to achieve.<br> It just happens to appeal to me.<br> Why did Grandfather Randall leave home...<br> and go off pioneering<br> into unknown country?<br> He made sacrifices for a reason...<br> so that his family<br> could have economic security.<br> Security from what?<br> So that I can learn to play a mean game<br> of bridge...<br> or ride to hounds, or marry a polo player?<br> Is that why Grandfather Randall<br> endured all those hardships?<br> But consider the family name.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> As far as New York is concerned...<br> Terry Randall is just another stage-struck<br> girl from the Middle West.<br> They don't know me from Eve.<br> But they're going to,<br> if I have anything to say about it.<br> I'm sorry, but I can't support you<br> in this idea any longer.<br> Financially or morally?<br> If you're going on with this notion,<br> you've got to do it alone.<br> - All right, then I'll have to do it alone.<br> - What if you're a failure? What then?<br> If I'm a failure, I'll be the first to admit it.<br> It may take years to find out.<br> It may take years to know anything,<br> but I'm going to stick to it.<br> Are you too proud to come back home<br> if you are a failure?<br> I haven't got that kind of pride.<br> - You would come home if you failed?<br> - Would you have me?<br> You're pretty stubborn,<br> but you're still my favorite daughter.<br> We'll leave it there. Check, please.<br> Well, hello, Mr. Powell. How are you?<br> So nice to see you again.<br> - Miss Shaw, may I present Mr. Powell?<br> - How do you do?<br> Wort you join us?<br> - I hope I'm not intruding.<br> - Well, I should say not.<br> There we are.<br> How many times have we been<br> introduced? Do you have any idea?<br> Thirty-seven, including tonight.<br> Thank you. I wonder if we're<br> fooling anybody but ourselves.<br> - You're in a very ugly humor this evening.<br> - Don't you like it?<br> If I need a stooge, you might<br> at least get me someone interesting.<br> I hate that word "stooge."<br> I'm retained as an escort.<br> Stooge is good enough.<br> Let's get out of here. I'm bored to death.<br> Why not relax? There are a couple<br> of new numbers I'd like to see.<br> Are you getting interested<br> in new numbers?<br> Shall I join in the conversation<br> just so people think we're together?<br> I think I can get you a job<br> with a ventriloquist.<br> Life is full of surprises.<br> - Couple of cute kids, aren't they?<br> - You think so?<br> I wonder who they are.<br> Just a lot of riffraff they pick up<br> around town.<br> Pardon me.<br> Mr. Powell, you're wanted on the phone.<br> Thank you. I'll be right back.<br> Why don't you two dance?<br> Remember, if you get any wrong numbers,<br> you can always get your nickel back.<br> - Shall we dance?<br> - No.<br> - Did you hear what she called us?<br> - What do you mean "us"?<br> I'll "riffraff" her.<br> I could hit her with this stick.<br> You did everything but poke her eye out.<br> The way that Powell sat grinning at us,<br> I could hit him, too.<br> That's all we need.<br> What do you mean, that's all we need?<br> I heard tonight that he owns<br> half interest in this club.<br> Or did you know that?<br> I thought it was funny that we should<br> happen to get this job all of a sudden.<br> And then came the dawn.<br> Do you think he has anything<br> to do with us being here?<br> Attagirl, Sherlock. You could put two and<br> two together and get something out of it.<br> - So that's it.<br> - Don't be a dope.<br> If he smiled at me tonight<br> the way he smiled at you...<br> I'd do a three-point collapse.<br> - May I come in?<br> - How do you do, Mr. Powell?<br> - L...<br> - Yes, come on in.<br> - I thought you were good tonight.<br> - Thank you. We thought so, too.<br> - Mind if I sit down?<br> - Why not? It's your club.<br> Not exactly. I have a small interest in it.<br> Don't pay any attention to her, Mr. Powell.<br> She's slightly barmy.<br> You don't like me, do you?<br> How could I help but like a man<br> who takes his mother out to a nightclub?<br> - That was your mother sitting with you?<br> - No. That was my friend's mother.<br> - Then I can speak freely?<br> - Go right ahead.<br> Your friend shows very bad taste<br> in picking mothers.<br> I'm beginning to think so myself.<br> Now, my ideal mother is young,<br> blond, slim...<br> and generally intriguing.<br> I'll see if I can get you one<br> for Mother's Day.<br> - How do you like them? Tall, fat, round?<br> - About your size.<br> That wouldn't be so easy.<br> You see, I'm not the stock size.<br> - Couldrt we talk it over at dinner?<br> - I'm very fond of dinner.<br> - Do you suppose you could send your car?<br> - Where would I send it?<br> I'm living at the Footlights Club,<br> but the traffic around there is a bit heavy.<br> - I see.<br> - So you'd better send it around here first.<br> Perhaps that would be better.<br> Shall we say tomorrow night<br> after the show?<br> - Mom will have a lamp in the window.<br> - Good night.<br> No. Mr. Powell isn't in today.<br> Did you have an appointment? Hello?<br> I could wait around<br> if there was any chance...<br> You could wait,<br> but I'm sure there's little chance.<br> Thank you. I'll wait.<br> Hello. I'm sure I don't know.<br> You might call later.<br> No, Mr. Powell's<br> out of town for the weekend.<br> How do you like that? Out of town.<br> I guess that must have been his double...<br> peeking through the door<br> a little while ago.<br> Imagine opening a great big office<br> like this just not to see people.<br> You can go in.<br> Mammy singer?<br> Maybe when Powell left town<br> he forgot to take his shoes with him.<br> - Hello, Kay.<br> - Hello.<br> You'd better sit down.<br> Mr. Powell's out. He's on a world tour.<br> Be careful what you say.<br> He may be hiding under the linoleum.<br> We're kidding. He isn't seeing anybody,<br> except by appointment.<br> I've got one.<br> I'm going to read that part today.<br> - May I touch you?<br> - You'll knock him off his chair.<br> I hope so. I've been studying all night.<br> - Do you have appointments, too?<br> - We're here for Randall.<br> If she doesn't crash Powell's office by 2:00,<br> lunch is on her.<br> We're starting off with caviar.<br> Not that small sturgeon kind,<br> but nice big whale caviar.<br> Miss Hamilton.<br> - Good luck, kid.<br> - The best.<br> I'm sorry, Miss Hamilton.<br> You can't go in now.<br> I tried to get you on the phone.<br> Some unexpected business came up.<br> Mr. Powell will have<br> to cancel that appointment.<br> - I can wait.<br> - It's impossible to see him today.<br> You'll have to make it next week.<br> He'll get in touch with you.<br> If I can only see him for five minutes...<br> I'm sorry.<br> You'll have to make it next week.<br> Please make it today because...<br> because...<br> Here, you mustrt! Somebody catch her!<br> - Get some water!<br> - You get out. We'll take care of her.<br> - I hope it's nothing I said.<br> - Put her on the couch.<br> What's happened?<br> Powell broke an appointment,<br> and when she found out...<br> she went out like a light.<br> - Let me help.<br> - Give me the water.<br> - She'll be okay.<br> - Try rubbing her hands.<br> Come on, darling. You fainted, dear.<br> He's great. Breaks an appointment<br> with an actress to get his shoes shined.<br> - You must remember that Mr. Powell has...<br> - Who does that Powell think he is?<br> - Here. You can't go in there.<br> - Just watch me.<br> - Are you the great Anthony Powell?<br> - Who might you be?<br> - That's not important.<br> - By what right...<br> By what right do you barricade yourself<br> and refuse to see us?<br> - Mind your business.<br> - Do you know a girl just fainted...<br> because you broke an appointment?<br> - Sorry. I didn't know.<br> - Because your door is always closed.<br> You're a producer. You should see them.<br> Why, the greatest actress<br> might be living 15 feet away from you...<br> and you'd never even give her a chance.<br> - Are you the greatest actress?<br> - I don't need you, but the other girls do.<br> They sweat, slave, and go without food<br> in the hope that someday...<br> someone like you<br> will come out and notice them.<br> Sorry, Mr. Powell.<br> She rushed in before I could stop her.<br> Okay. How is the girl who fainted?<br> - Fine. She's going home.<br> - I'll ring when I want you.<br> Thank you.<br> - Sit down, young lady. I want to talk.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - All right, sonny.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Sit down.<br> - All right, I'm sitting.<br> Now listen, my militant friend.<br> I judge from your attitude<br> you hold me responsible...<br> for any tragedy in the lives of girls<br> who come up here. Correct?<br> No, but you ought to see them.<br> Maybe they've got something.<br> Maybe they have.<br> Do you realize that if I saw all of the girls,<br> I wouldn't have time for anything else?<br> Every year, about 50,000 girls...<br> Please sit down.<br> - You make me nervous.<br> - I am sitting.<br> Every year, about 50,000 girls decide<br> they want to go on the stage.<br> They'd be better off washing dishes.<br> How about the other 500?<br> Do you see them?<br> No.<br> There are at least 50 girls for every job.<br> Are they the right ones?<br> You don't have the courtesy<br> to go out there and say no to them.<br> That would give them some contact<br> with the theater.<br> You're one that can't complain.<br> You're not the type.<br> You're very smug, Mr. Powell.<br> Whether or not you're satisfied<br> that I'm not responsible...<br> for all of the ills<br> of the theatrical profession...<br> run along and leave me alone<br> with my conscience.<br> I doubt if you have a conscience.<br> Miss Arden, I won't see<br> anybody else today. I don't care who...<br> Is he here? Hello, Mr. Carmichael.<br> Come in.<br> Hello, Mr. Powell.<br> - How are you?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> I hope this has nothing to do with that<br> other matter. I thought that was settled.<br> - It isn't anything like that.<br> - That's fine. Sit down.<br> - Have a cigar? Cigarette?<br> - No, thanks. No.<br> - We just had a little excitement.<br> - Yes. I couldn't help but hear.<br> - Who was the girl?<br> - I haven't the faintest idea.<br> Some overexcited stage-struck damsel.<br> - Is she an actress?<br> - Lf she is, she's a pretty bad one, I can tell.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - I seldom miss.<br> Something should be done<br> about girls who try to go on the stage.<br> They'd be better off at home<br> raising families.<br> - That's what my client thinks.<br> - Client?<br> - You're producing a new play shortly.<br> - Enchanted April, why?<br> The client I just spoke of<br> is somewhat interested in the theater.<br> I can't mention any names, of course.<br> You know how those people are.<br> Somewhere he got the idea<br> that he'd like to dabble in show business.<br> Fresh money is always welcome.<br> Under the circumstances, I'm not so sure<br> that you would be interested.<br> Under what circumstances?<br> However, here's the proposition.<br> We may as well go over it.<br> Afterwards, if you're still interested,<br> we can go on from there.<br> Hello. No, this is the Footlights Club.<br> Footlights.<br> No, "Foot."<br> How can it be the Beacon Laundry<br> when it's the Footlights Club?<br> Certainly, I'm sure. I'm right in it.<br> Is that so?<br> Go wash your own neck<br> and see how you like it.<br> - How's Kay feeling?<br> - She's all right.<br> - What did the doctor say was wrong?<br> - Malnutrition, he called it.<br> - That's Latin for "not eating."<br> - All she needs is some good meals.<br> Try and get them. And a nice long rest.<br> She hasn't worked in almost a year.<br> That's just the same as a rest.<br> Come here. Shake your head.<br> - Why?<br> - Never mind. Shake your head!<br> Like this?<br> That's what I thought.<br> I can hear it rattle just as plain.<br> - What is...<br> - Nothing.<br> I hope dear old Mr. Anthony Powell<br> sleeps well tonight.<br> What's this I hear about the Randall girl<br> telling him off this afternoon?<br> I didn't hear,<br> but she sure made a lot of noise.<br> It cost us lunch, and I hate to say it,<br> but I am revising my opinion of her.<br> - Has Mr. Powell's car come yet?<br> - I ain't seen it or heard the horn.<br> Maybe that's him now.<br> How is she going to pay her doctor bills?<br> It's all done with mirrors.<br> - Does Miss Jean Maitland live here?<br> - Yes.<br> - Will you give her these?<br> - I'll see that she gets them.<br> Thank you, Hattie.<br> - They're not for you.<br> - I recognize the florist.<br> The boy said they're for Jean.<br> So they are.<br> - Let me take them to her.<br> - Anything to save me from a trip upstairs.<br> Looks like there's a new queen bee<br> buzzing around the hive.<br> It seems to be the same king.<br> - How's Kay?<br> - She's fine.<br> It's so silly of her to have gone<br> without food.<br> Oh, yes, I think it's terribly silly<br> to go without food.<br> I didn't mean it that way.<br> - What did the doctor say?<br> - She's going to be all right.<br> I think it was stupid<br> not to let people know.<br> Sweet of you to send the doctor.<br> - Don't say anything.<br> - Nobody knows.<br> Please don't mention it again.<br> Not that I'm sentimental.<br> It's just that the whole thing<br> seems unnecessary to me.<br> May I come in?<br> Sure. I guess you'll be safe.<br> The exterminators won't be here<br> till tomorrow.<br> How did they miss you last time?<br> I was out in society<br> with an old boyfriend of yours.<br> Speaking of funerals,<br> these flowers just arrived for you.<br> You brought them up? My little flower girl.<br> If I could find my purse,<br> I'd give you a big 5-cent tip.<br> I really came along to give you a tip.<br> Don't bother to read the note.<br> I'll tell you what it says:<br> "Eleven roses and the 12th is you."<br> You're doing very well up to now.<br> Tell me more.<br> His routine's pretty much the same<br> with all the girls.<br> It all ends up with a quiet little supper<br> in his penthouse...<br> with champagne and all the trimmings<br> and the view and all that.<br> And then there's Harcourt.<br> Harcourt's really a gem.<br> That isn't Harcourt you're wearing.<br> No, my sweet.<br> That's a little thing called a star sapphire.<br> Harcourt's the butler.<br> He's very discreet, though.<br> One of those butlers<br> that tiptoes backwards.<br> Yes. I know the type very well.<br> But you'll get to know him much better.<br> And he's very deaf.<br> You really won't have to bother<br> to scream for help.<br> I must tell you about the lighting effect.<br> It's very good.<br> It goes with that "tired little boy" routine.<br> I won't spoil it.<br> I'll let all that come as a surprise.<br> It must be galling to you older women<br> to lose your meal ticket to younger riffraff.<br> Just a leave of absence, dearie,<br> and in the meantime...<br> I have my lovely sable coat and<br> my star sapphire to keep me company.<br> It's lovely,<br> but I'm afraid you paid too much for it.<br> That's your mistake.<br> I'm not as generous as my Aunt Susan.<br> Goodbye. Thanks for calling.<br> If you ever need a good pallbearer,<br> remember I'm at your service.<br> Didrt mean to eavesdrop,<br> but I couldn't help overhearing.<br> You're not really running around<br> with that man Powell, are you?<br> - Why not?<br> - Why play with fire just to spite Linda?<br> - I can take care of myself.<br> - I think you need a governess.<br> Why shouldn't I go out with him?<br> He's very charming.<br> So are snakes.<br> Besides, if I don't go out with him,<br> Ann and I will lose our jobs...<br> and I'll be back where I started from.<br> That's a rather lame excuse.<br> You got along somehow before,<br> didn't you?<br> - I'm sick of that.<br> - Why don't you stick to your ideals?<br> - They're crude, but they're all right.<br> - You should talk!<br> For heavers sake, don't bring up<br> that grandfather thing again.<br> - Besides, it's none of your business.<br> - I'm sorry, ma'am.<br> That's a very beautiful ermine jacket<br> you have on, very similar to one of mine.<br> I didn't expect you back so soon.<br> Don't think I intended to borrow it.<br> I just wanted to see how I'd feel in it.<br> - Do you feel very different?<br> - I'll say.<br> - Why don't you wear it?<br> - Do you mean it?<br> Why not? You may as well<br> go to perdition in ermine.<br> You're sure to come back in rags.<br> You're funny.<br> In some ways, you're not such a bad egg.<br> - As eggs go, I probably have my points.<br> - Thanks.<br> Not at all. Anything for old Seattle.<br> I'm not sure about dinner. Just a minute.<br> What's on the menu tonight?<br> - What do you think?<br> - Don't tell me.<br> I believe I could manage it.<br> Yes, I'll try to get another girl.<br> What the well-dressed roommate<br> will wear.<br> Pardonnez-moi.<br> Look, Henry. That's where you'll wind up<br> if you don't behave yourself.<br> If your line isn't too busy tonight,<br> I have a couple of lumber...<br> No. Don't mention the word "lumber."<br> I am dining tonight on<br> pheasant bordelaise...<br> with peach-fuzz dressing...<br> - Where is bordelaise?<br> - She doesn't even know what pheasant is.<br> Naturally. There's a difference<br> between pheasant and peasant.<br> My friend wouldn't think<br> of serving peasant.<br> No, but he's willing to take them out<br> once or twice.<br> But when he's through, he's through.<br> That's what I love about my friend.<br> It's one thing to borrow a friend's friend.<br> It's another thing to hold him,<br> if you know what I mean.<br> Would you mind telling the lady<br> I don't want to buy anything today?<br> Goodbye, and when I return,<br> I'll tell you how the other half lives.<br> Nice meeting you.<br> If it's not asking too much,<br> let's not be late again.<br> Lead the way, Higgins.<br> You don't suppose she was burned up<br> by any chance, do you?<br> Why don't you two have it out<br> with sharp knives?<br> - Hello, Bill.<br> - Hi, palsie. Hello, Ann.<br> Hello. Make it snappy. We're in a hurry.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Just a grouch. When did you get back?<br> This morning.<br> Show was a very quick flop...<br> in spite of one of the best<br> press campaigns.<br> No, thanks. Gave it up when I was seven.<br> - Bright girl. Busy tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> I couldn't give you much time tonight,<br> but how about dinner tomorrow night?<br> - I don't think I can very well.<br> - Why not?<br> Since we've gotten this job,<br> I haven't had much time for anything.<br> - You haven't given up eating, have you?<br> - It isn't that. It's just that...<br> I don't think<br> we'd better see each other for a while.<br> - Why?<br> - I just think it's better, that's all.<br> Oh.<br> - Why do you say "oh" like that?<br> - How would you say it?<br> You make it sound like<br> it meant something else.<br> Does it?<br> - Whatever I do is my own business.<br> - Are you coming, or aren't you?<br> Shut up.<br> Did you eat something sour<br> for lunch today?<br> I'm sorry, Bill, but I've got to live<br> my own life from now on.<br> Sure.<br> But it wouldn't interfere with your life...<br> if I walked down to the corner with you?<br> No, I guess not.<br> That's $50,000 you owe me.<br> What do you want to do?<br> - One shake, double or nothing.<br> - All right, go ahead.<br> We're even.<br> - Did you enjoy your supper?<br> - I didn't dare to.<br> Why not?<br> Makes it too tough to go back<br> to that lamb stew.<br> You don't have to go back<br> if you don't want to.<br> Do you have suppers like this all the time?<br> Practically all the time. Why?<br> Just wondered. I wish I'd been born lucky<br> instead of beautiful and hungry.<br> You can't have everything.<br> But you are beautiful.<br> I'm the lucky one.<br> Will you have a little champagne?<br> No, thanks.<br> I won't be able to stand up as it is.<br> - I knew she was lying to me.<br> - Who?<br> - He isn't deaf at all.<br> - He hasn't been.<br> It just shows you.<br> You can't trust people nowadays.<br> That's right. Don't you want a little coffee?<br> - That's a wonderful view.<br> - Yes, it is. It's a wonderful view.<br> It's a beautiful city. Just like a fairyland.<br> It's full of color, romance,<br> illusion, glamour.<br> Maybe it depends on which window<br> you see it from.<br> You should see it only from here.<br> - Do those lights keep you awake?<br> - So far they haven't.<br> I love New York from up here.<br> It looks all rouged and manicured<br> and ready to go out for the evening.<br> You're quite a little philosopher,<br> aren't you?<br> - It's probably the champagne talking.<br> - Mighty good talk.<br> - That's mighty good champagne.<br> - Let's have more of both.<br> All right.<br> Who are the three little men?<br> They're three figures<br> I picked up in the Orient.<br> Anyone I should know?<br> This one takes care of all good little girls<br> who work very hard for a living.<br> This one sees to it that they meet<br> the right people. And this one...<br> This one went to market.<br> He also sees to it that little girls<br> don't have to eat lamb stew.<br> - Did you pick her up in the Orient, too?<br> - No. That's Mrs. Powell.<br> We're not divorced or anything like that.<br> And that's Junior.<br> Fine-Iooking boy, isn't he?<br> I never believe in making pretenses.<br> Lots of men who are separated...<br> from their wives let it be understood<br> that they're single.<br> I believe, in this day and age...<br> that a man can have his home<br> on one hand, and still live his own life.<br> - That is, any man of character.<br> - That's big of you.<br> It happens to be the way I believe.<br> - That is very big of you.<br> - Why don't you relax?<br> There's a few things<br> I want to talk over with you.<br> After all, you must be very tired<br> dancing all evening.<br> Here. Sit down right here. That's it.<br> There you are again.<br> I'm glad you're not deaf<br> because if you were deaf...<br> you wouldn't be able to hear anything,<br> and that would be terrible.<br> - Yes, ma'am, that would be terrible.<br> - Sure would be terrible.<br> Yes, terrible. It would be awful. Yes.<br> I never know whether he's coming out<br> or going in.<br> - What happened?<br> - Isn't that more restful?<br> - I thought something blew out.<br> - It does improve the view, doesn't it?<br> It's beautiful.<br> It's beautiful now,<br> but think of how much more beautiful...<br> it'll be when your name is flashing<br> across the horizon.<br> "Jean Maitland" in letters that big.<br> - That big.<br> - All right, that big.<br> It's got to be big enough<br> to keep people awake.<br> It'll be big enough.<br> I'll be the sculptor, and you'll be the clay.<br> I'll mold you into the greatest dancer<br> that Broadway has ever known.<br> I'll be Pygmalion. You'll be Galatea.<br> - Sounds like a fairy story.<br> - Isn't life a fairy story...<br> and aren't grown-up people<br> just little children at heart?<br> I know at the office, I'm gruff<br> Anthony Powell, theatrical producer.<br> That's a pose.<br> Here with you,<br> I'm just a tired little boy with a dream.<br> Who were you supposed to be?<br> You were supposed to be somebody,<br> and I was supposed to be somebody.<br> Pygmalion and Galatea.<br> - And who am I?<br> - You're Galatea.<br> Am I Galatea?<br> Pygmalion was a sculptor who carved<br> a statue of a woman out of marble.<br> The statue was so beautiful<br> that he fell in love with it.<br> And his love was so deep, and tender,<br> and true...<br> that it warmed the statue to life,<br> and they lived happily ever after.<br> Did they get married?<br> No. I don't think people got married<br> in those days.<br> I think that's terrible.<br> - What's terrible?<br> - They didn't get married.<br> - But she was just a statue.<br> - That's what's so terrible about it.<br> You can't cry over that.<br> The whole thing's a merry story.<br> - But look at all the trouble he went to.<br> - He didn't go to any trouble.<br> You're just getting hysterical.<br> Besides, he had a wife and son...<br> and couldn't get married. Harcourt!<br> He should have thought of that.<br> She was minding her own business.<br> You're getting excited. Come on. The coat.<br> I'm not excited, and it may be nothing<br> to you, but it was something to her.<br> - He can't do that to her!<br> - You bet he can't. You bet.<br> Why don't you do something?<br> I'm going to do something about it<br> in the morning.<br> You run along and get some sleep...<br> and don't worry about a thing.<br> My lawyer will straighten it out.<br> What thing?<br> Whatever there is to be straightened out,<br> I'll see that it's done.<br> Don't worry about a thing.<br> - You're wonderful.<br> - Harcourt's right here.<br> He will see you to your car.<br> That's a good girl.<br> - You're wonderful.<br> - Yes. You're wonderful...<br> and I'm wonderful. Harcourt's wonderful.<br> The whole thing is wonderful.<br> You seem to be rather high yourself.<br> You must have had<br> a pretty good time tonight.<br> I'll say.<br> - It was wonderful.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> The view was wonderful,<br> the supper was wonderful.<br> I won $50,000. And Harcourt is wonderful.<br> - And who's Harcourt?<br> - What's his name?<br> - Do you know your own name?<br> - It's going to be in letters that big.<br> - No, that big.<br> - Whose, yours or Harcourt's?<br> You said it.<br> And he's going to divorce his wife<br> and marry Galatea.<br> And who's Galatea?<br> I... She's a statue.<br> She should never have gotten married<br> in the first place.<br> But it's going to be wonderful.<br> Yes, I'm sure that everything's<br> going to be very wonderful.<br> The view is wonderful.<br> - And Harcourt's wonderful, and you are.<br> - And you're wonderful.<br> And I'm wonderful, too. Now, come on.<br> Let me help you take off your things.<br> We're all going to go to the wedding.<br> - You're going to be there, too.<br> - I'll be there.<br> Harcourt's going to marry Galatea...<br> and we're all going to live together<br> in a great big sign. And I feel terrible.<br> But isn't it wonderful?<br> And tomorrow you're gonna have<br> a wonderful hangover...<br> and that won't be so wonderful.<br> It's wonderful.<br> That's my story.<br> How did you get in the theater?<br> How did any of us get in?<br> I've never even been in a theater,<br> except as a spectator.<br> Where'd you first get the bug?<br> It started when I was a little girl.<br> I went to see a circus, and there was<br> a beautiful lady in pink tights.<br> - Wasrt you, was it?<br> - No. I don't like pink.<br> - She was riding a large white horse.<br> - Are you sure it wasrt a purple cow?<br> Whatever it was, here I am,<br> no horse, no job, not even the pink tights.<br> Is Mr. Powell's car calling for you<br> at the Grotto tonight?<br> Mr. Powell's car calls for me every night.<br> I was just wondering.<br> I saw Mr. Powell at the Colonie Bar<br> this afternoon with a young lady.<br> You've done much better than I expected.<br> I didn't think you'd last.<br> Is madame certain<br> she hasn't been seeing things?<br> Madame is quite certain.<br> You'll get a note later<br> saying he's been detained on business.<br> When he doesn't send his car,<br> he sends a note.<br> He's quite courteous that way.<br> This is where I came in. Let's get going.<br> I expect this to be the best play<br> I've ever produced.<br> Every actress on Broadway has<br> begged to play the part of Jeanette.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> it's one of the best parts ever written.<br> Isn't that more restful?<br> On the contrary.<br> It makes me rather uncomfortable.<br> Why don't you relax?<br> Let me tell you the story of the play.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - The scene opens on Long Island.<br> It's a beautiful day in spring...<br> and Jeanette,<br> that's the character I want you to play...<br> is brokenearted.<br> Her husband's about to leave her.<br> Are you sure that you brought me here<br> to discuss the play?<br> Why do you ask?<br> - I'm a rather suspicious person.<br> - You want to be a star, don't you?<br> Under the proper circumstances.<br> Why don't you sit back on the couch?<br> You'll be more comfortable.<br> Would you like to see your name<br> blazing across the horizon...<br> In big letters, but it must be<br> a good-sized sign. I'm used to that.<br> So is Jean Maitland.<br> - What?<br> - Do you love her?<br> - No!<br> - I thought so.<br> She's just a girl I took an interest in.<br> She's becoming more or less of a pest.<br> - Say, what are you, a district attorney?<br> - Not exactly.<br> What has Jean Maitland to do with this?<br> Do you want to play this part?<br> I'm really tremendously flattered,<br> but how do you know that I can act?<br> Because I know.<br> How do you know?<br> You've never seen me on the stage.<br> - And how do you know that?<br> - Because I've never been on the stage.<br> I did see you perform in my office.<br> I wasrt performing that day.<br> Performing or not,<br> I do know an actress when I see one.<br> - How can you tell...<br> - Stop asking questions.<br> - I'd just like to know why...<br> - You don't have to. I talk here.<br> Whether you were acting or no...<br> you showed fire and emotion.<br> That's what I need here.<br> But I'm not an emotional person.<br> You will be when I'm through molding you.<br> I don't want to be molded.<br> I believe in acting with my brain.<br> I'll mold you one of those also.<br> Will you have champagne?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Mind if I do?<br> Go ahead.<br> - Expecting someone, sir?<br> - Get the champagne.<br> Do you mind if I answer the door?<br> - How did you get up here?<br> - Have you got a woman in this apartment?<br> - Who wants to know?<br> - Who has a better right?<br> See here. I'm in a very bad humor!<br> You get downstairs.<br> How can you shout<br> after all you promised last night?<br> - I'm not shouting! I promised nothing.<br> - Where is she?<br> Say, by what right<br> do you come crashing into this...<br> So it's you!<br> - Hello.<br> - Say, what is this?<br> That's what I'm asking.<br> Mr. Powell was just telling me<br> the plot of a play.<br> So that's how you got on the floor.<br> Get up. That isn't where I left you.<br> What is this? A frame-up?<br> - Tony, darling, control yourself.<br> - Don't "Tony, darling" me! Come on.<br> Get up out of there.<br> And you go home immediately.<br> I'll go when you hear what I've to say.<br> Say it. She came up here<br> to sign a contract to do a play.<br> What's she going to sign it with,<br> champagne?<br> - Call the manager.<br> - You needrt get any manager.<br> I thought I was in love with you,<br> but I see my mistake now.<br> I only went out with you<br> in the first place to spite Linda.<br> Yes, you'd better hide your face,<br> you double-dealing, double-crossing...<br> Darling, I didn't know what I was doing.<br> My own roommate, and you preach ideals,<br> you and your grandfather.<br> Look, I've had enough.<br> Preaches ideals so she can chisel<br> when my back is turned.<br> You can take your old red fox cape.<br> I'll never borrow another thing<br> again from you as long as I live.<br> - Don't try to borrow anything from me.<br> - Don't start that again.<br> I hope you two snakes will be very happy.<br> And you, too, you reptile.<br> Never mind.<br> - What's so funny?<br> - Everything.<br> It isn't funny at all.<br> What is she going to think?<br> Exactly what I want her to think.<br> But why? Why?<br> For several reasons.<br> In the first place, I like her.<br> - She won't like you very much.<br> - She'll see the light in time.<br> You mean you'd jeopardize<br> your own reputation?<br> Arert you a kind of a Girl Scout?<br> Just a girl who uses her brain.<br> Anyhow, I wanted to show you<br> that I can act.<br> - You are a faker.<br> - We're both fakers.<br> Isn't faking the essence of acting?<br> It may apply to actors,<br> but it does not apply to me.<br> You're a bigger faker than I am.<br> - That's libel.<br> - Not if I can prove it.<br> This young mars your son, isn't he?<br> - Please keep my family out of this.<br> - Lf he's your son, he must be elder to you...<br> because that photo has been used<br> to advertise...<br> a certain military academy<br> for a great number of years.<br> How do you know?<br> Because my brother<br> went to that academy.<br> And this lady,<br> whom you pretend is your wife...<br> she's done a lot of posing<br> for the face powder ads, I believe.<br> My friend, you have just broken up<br> a very convenient marriage.<br> I think that we understand each other.<br> - Now, what about the play?<br> - Yes. Where were we?<br> - We were in Long Island.<br> - Yes. The scene opens on Long Island.<br> It's a beautiful day in spring,<br> and Jeanette, that's the character...<br> - Yes. That's me.<br> - That's right, is brokenearted.<br> She's about to lose her husband.<br> Not exactly the way<br> I just lost my wife, but...<br> She's coming.<br> Where is everybody, Hattie?<br> Where do you want them to be?<br> Madeline told me someone down here<br> wanted to see me.<br> If there's somebody here to see you,<br> we'd better turn on the lights.<br> Enough confetti. I've got to sweep it up!<br> It's for you, Ann.<br> - I feel like crying.<br> - No.<br> I don't...<br> No speeches at this banquet, you sit<br> right here. You're the guest of honor.<br> I see you remembered<br> the right number of years.<br> We won't tell, if you don't tell on us.<br> Take a big blow and make a wish.<br> No. Wait. I have to turn the lights off.<br> Make a wish.<br> - Quiet, everybody.<br> - And don't tell us. That's fatal.<br> I guess everyone knows what it is<br> without my telling.<br> It's coming true. I can feel it in my bones.<br> She made it.<br> It's so beautiful, I hate to cut it.<br> That's one of Hattie's. Maybe you can't.<br> I resent that!<br> Be careful you don't drop it on your foot.<br> - Girls, I have the most wonderful news.<br> - Maybe the house is on fire.<br> I've just been talking to Terry Randall.<br> - What's wonderful about that news?<br> - Maybe she's had an accident.<br> She's going to play the leading part<br> in Anthony Powell's new play.<br> - Randall?<br> - Isn't that exciting?<br> And I've only been coaching her<br> such a short time.<br> Maybe that's why she got the part.<br> - Which play is she going to do?<br> - His new play.<br> - Enchanted April?<br> - Yeah.<br> - The part of Jeanette?<br> - Isn't it hard to believe?<br> Perhaps you girls will change your opinion<br> of Miss Randall after this.<br> Perhaps you'll change your opinion of me,<br> too.<br> And perhaps you'll pay more attention<br> to your theatrical training.<br> Poor kid.<br> We can't even have a birthday party...<br> without Randall or something else<br> crabbing it.<br> Why don't you leave Randall alone?<br> She hasn't harmed anyone.<br> No, but she always looks like<br> she's ready to start.<br> Olga's right. She hasn't harmed anyone.<br> All she did was steal the part<br> you wanted to do.<br> It wasrt my part because I wanted it.<br> Last year I took a part away from a girl.<br> - No. This is different.<br> - It isn't different.<br> Isn't there enough heartache in the theater<br> without our hating each other?<br> - You're crying.<br> - I'm crying because I'm happy.<br> I've had my moments in the theater,<br> and I think Terry deserves her chance.<br> If you say anything to her,<br> that won't get the part for me.<br> There's going to be other parts<br> and other plays.<br> This is my birthday,<br> and I'm going to be happy.<br> The devil with the theaters.<br> All right, folks. Places, please.<br> We'll take this scene over again<br> from the beginning.<br> Go right ahead. Go ahead.<br> Here she is now,<br> coming up the garden path.<br> - What are we going to say to her?<br> - I don't know.<br> The poor child.<br> She's probably brokenearted.<br> You'd better let me talk to her first.<br> Well?<br> Come on, Miss Randall, this is your cue.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't know you were rehearsing again.<br> In the theater,<br> we are supposed to come in on cue.<br> But there are some men out there<br> fooling around.<br> Would you ask them to stop?<br> We find it necessary in the theater...<br> to have men<br> fooling around with ropes and things.<br> If you'd just pay<br> more attention to your cues...<br> and not contradict, you might do better.<br> - You needrt be sarcastic about it.<br> - I apologize deeply.<br> - Now get out and come in on cue.<br> - All right. Don't get excited.<br> I just can't hear anything<br> with these people.<br> All right. Go ahead.<br> The poor child.<br> She's probably brokenearted.<br> You'd better let me talk to her first.<br> Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. Hello, Kate.<br> The calla lilies are in bloom again.<br> Such a strange flower,<br> suitable to any occasion.<br> I carried them on my wedding day,<br> and now...<br> I place them here<br> in memory of something that has died.<br> He needs a good thrashing.<br> You poor child.<br> Are you gathered here to mourn,<br> or to bring me comfort?<br> There's still something not quite right<br> about that line.<br> You might read it correctly.<br> That would help.<br> I don't see why you should<br> object to an intelligent suggestion.<br> I've written several important plays.<br> One of them received the Pulitzer Prize.<br> Have you written any plays?<br> There's an old saying that you<br> don't have to be a hen to know a bad egg.<br> There's nothing wrong with the play.<br> I'll explain the scene to you again.<br> This womars husband has decided<br> to leave her, and she's brokenearted.<br> Can you understand that?<br> Yes, I can understand that,<br> but you told me to be sophisticated.<br> On the surface.<br> But inside here, your heart is broken.<br> There's a smile on your face,<br> and you're crying in your heart.<br> I don't see how you can do<br> two things at the same time.<br> I refuse to sit quietly by<br> and see my play butchered.<br> As long as everyone is putting in their two<br> cents won'th somewhat promiscuously...<br> I should like to remind you that I have<br> a Broadway reputation to consider.<br> I don't see what your reputation has to do<br> with our conversation.<br> - Give me a light, will you?<br> - Miss Randall.<br> I'll have to ask you to pay attention<br> to the director.<br> What am I supposed to do? Walk around<br> like a puppet or use my intelligence?<br> You're to do as you're told!<br> - Don't yell at me!<br> - I am yelling at you!<br> If you think I'm so terrible,<br> why did you hire me for the part?<br> That's what I'd like to know!<br> Temporary insanity, probably.<br> Now go ahead and do as you're told!<br> - Well, I... The...<br> - Go ahead and do it!<br> I am doing it,<br> but the only thing that I'd just like to...<br> - How long have you been coaching her?<br> - I've only had her a month.<br> No one could possibly get that bad<br> in a month's time.<br> - Would you mind a suggestion?<br> - Anything, please.<br> I was wondering, could you possibly see<br> an older woman in the part?<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Where's this fellow Carmichael?<br> I've got to get out of this.<br> - He should be here any minute.<br> - There he is.<br> Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. Hello, Kate.<br> The calla lilies are in bloom again.<br> - Mr. Powell, how's everything?<br> - I've got to get out of this contract.<br> - I'm afraid that's impossible.<br> - Who is this mysterious client of yours?<br> The head of some combine<br> trying to ruin me?<br> You listen to this rehearsal,<br> you'll understand.<br> Isn't she turning out<br> as well as you expected?<br> She has possibilities,<br> but right now she's an amateur.<br> As emotional as a fish,<br> and she's a nuisance in the bargain.<br> She questions everyone:<br> The director, the writer, the actors.<br> I don't see how this play will be anything<br> but a flop.<br> Is that so?<br> - You seem to be pleased about it.<br> - After all, it's my client's money.<br> I'd give you the money back<br> if you let me out of the contract.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Is your client by any chance<br> in love with this girl?<br> To tell you the truth, I believe he is.<br> It takes all kinds of people<br> to make a world.<br> - Mr. Powell!<br> - Coming.<br> I still don't understand anything he says.<br> He tells me to laugh and cry<br> at the same time.<br> - I don't know what...<br> - That's plain to be seen.<br> - Let's get this organized.<br> - Go ahead and get it organized...<br> Do you think my dress is fancy enough<br> to wear to opening night?<br> For Randall's opening,<br> you ought to wear black.<br> She was nice enough<br> to give us free tickets.<br> She wanted to be sure<br> someone was in the audience.<br> "The night was growing old<br> As she trudged through snow and sleet<br> "Her nose was long and cold<br> And her shoes were full of feet"<br> Look. Don't you like my dress?<br> - Don't you think it's pretty?<br> - Where'd you get that?<br> - Your mother send it from Louisiana?<br> - Yes, she makes all my clothes.<br> - What are those things there? Pecans?<br> - No. Just doodads.<br> Got to have 35 cents.<br> - For what?<br> - For Terry's flowers.<br> - Don't make me laugh.<br> - Come on, cough up.<br> We've only got $3.85.<br> We need as much as we can get.<br> All right. I'll give $1 if it's for her funeral.<br> She tries harder to hate people<br> than anyone I know.<br> - Here, keep the change.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> You're so fond of feuds, you should live<br> in the Kentucky mountains.<br> We haven't much time to eat.<br> Got to stop at the florist.<br> This will be my 35th performance<br> as spectator.<br> Cheer up, Mary Lou.<br> Someday people on the stage will watch<br> the audience, and you'll be a sensation.<br> So long, string bean.<br> I shall see you at the theater.<br> You're not going to catch<br> the opening tonight?<br> I'm going tomorrow and catch the closing.<br> You talk as though you want her<br> to be a flop.<br> No, but as long as she's a flop,<br> I'm going to be there and see it.<br> She's sore because Terry<br> took my boyfriend away from her.<br> - What do you mean boyfriend?<br> - Tired little boyfriend.<br> Someday I'll be lucky and run into you<br> when I'm carrying a bowl of goldfish.<br> Get me. Ain't I the one?<br> Look at her.<br> Will you sew me into this?<br> I'll get out of it myself.<br> - You look all dressed up.<br> - I am dressed up.<br> - Are you going alone?<br> - Not Mackintosh. I got a beau.<br> - Who?<br> - The butcher's helper.<br> He was a little hard to break down.<br> After I told him I had passes,<br> he nearly cut his thumb off.<br> Why can't I get a butcher?<br> Be still, my heart. Maybe that's him now.<br> Hattie, this is your night. You've got to<br> make an entrance. I'll get the door.<br> Hattie, have a heart.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello. It's raining.<br> - Is that what it's doing?<br> - Kind of wet.<br> Rain usually is this time of year.<br> Hattie will be right out.<br> Butch, meet Miss Farnsbarn,<br> Miss Fannisbess, Miss France.<br> - How'd you know my name was Butch?<br> - Same way you knew it was raining.<br> Butch, there's something<br> I want to talk to you about.<br> One of these days<br> when Hattie comes to the market...<br> to get some lamb,<br> if your hand slipped a little chicken in...<br> Isn't he handsome?<br> Some people do things like that for others.<br> Others do things like that for some people.<br> I think you should do it, don't you?<br> - Why don't you come in and get the meat?<br> - I will.<br> I was downtown the other day.<br> I was telling the girls that I saw you.<br> By the window with your white coat on,<br> looking wonderful.<br> I'd like to turn my back on you<br> when you're holding knives.<br> Butch is wonderful.<br> He promised when you shop...<br> to get some chicken<br> all mixed up in the lamb.<br> No, I didn't exactly.<br> Hattie, don't do anything<br> Butch wouldn't do.<br> I'll do something for you sometime.<br> I'll poison your soup.<br> Butch, you got a friend?<br> He says no.<br> The calla lilies are in bloom again.<br> Such a strange flower,<br> suitable for every occasion.<br> I carried them on my wedding day,<br> and now...<br> I place them here<br> in memory of something that has died.<br> Cue from him.<br> Are you gathered here to mourn or have...<br> I thought I told you to rest.<br> - I can't remember a line.<br> - Of course you can't.<br> Nobody can an hour before curtain time<br> on opening night.<br> When you put your foot on that stage,<br> it will all come back, as if by magic.<br> - Suppose they don't come back?<br> - They'll come. Somehow they always do.<br> - No, I couldn't. Thank you. You're sweet.<br> - Dear, I'll leave the tea here.<br> The calla lilies are in...<br> I can't remember that.<br> Calla lilies are in bloom.<br> Such a strange flower...<br> They seem to be useful on...<br> I don't know what in the dickens<br> they're useful on occasion.<br> I'll never be able to remember. Kay.<br> The doctor told you to stay in bed.<br> I'm not going to stay in bed<br> with all this excitement.<br> But you mustrt disobey orders.<br> I was coming to see you before I left.<br> Keep her cheerful, Kay.<br> She's got first-night nerves.<br> You've had them.<br> I must hurry and get my...<br> Your coat and galoshes are there.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> - And don't let her do any more rehearsing.<br> - I'll sit on her.<br> It would be raining in the bargain.<br> It's that first speech. If I could only<br> get through that, I'd be all right.<br> Would you mind watching, Kay?<br> The calla lilies are in bloom again.<br> Such a strange flower,<br> suitable to any occasion.<br> - May I make a suggestion?<br> - I wish you would.<br> The way you hold the flowers.<br> I've always thought that Jeanette<br> would hold them as she would a child.<br> - They never had a child, you see, and...<br> - I see.<br> Do you suppose<br> that's what the author intended?<br> I'm sure he did.<br> And when she says, "In memory<br> of something that has died," she...<br> Kay, you know this play.<br> It's not a play.<br> It really happened to someone I know.<br> Darling, you mustrt do that.<br> This isn't just your night.<br> It's my night, too.<br> You've got to be a success tonight.<br> You've got to give a great performance.<br> - No matter what happens.<br> - Is something the matter?<br> No, I'm just excited, that's all.<br> Here, you sit down<br> and I'll get you some tea.<br> The condemned woman<br> drank a hearty supper.<br> I felt the same way.<br> I felt like running<br> and hiding from everyone...<br> but after that opening speech,<br> there's a thrill you'll never forget.<br> It's a thrill that only comes once.<br> Thrill? I can't make out<br> whether it's a thrill or agony.<br> It's both.<br> Arert you ready yet?<br> Come. We'll have to hurry.<br> - Here I go.<br> - The opening night, you know.<br> Be quick, dear.<br> - Wish her luck, Kay.<br> - Yes, darling, wish me luck. Goodbye.<br> I want to give you this. A girl gave it to me<br> last year on my opening night.<br> It brought me luck.<br> Darling, you're sweet.<br> I wish you were going to be there<br> to hold my hand.<br> I'll be there. In spirit.<br> Are you coming, or are you not?<br> Here she comes.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Goodbye, Terry.<br> Five minutes to curtain.<br> Five minutes, Miss Hamilton.<br> Don't worry, Miss Hamilton.<br> Everything's going to be fine.<br> Places, now. Places, please.<br> Ready, everybody.<br> Are you ready, Miss Hamilton?<br> It's a bought-out house.<br> Everybody's out there!<br> You haven't a thing to worry about.<br> - Good luck.<br> - All right, now. Stand by, please.<br> Everybody in their places, now.<br> Ready, Miss Hamilton?<br> Did you hear that? That's all for you.<br> This is your night.<br> Who's that?<br> Kay. It's Kay.<br> She jumped before I could stop her.<br> She's lying out there in the rain.<br> Calling Car 19.<br> Go to 87 West 58th Street.<br> Ambulance call.<br> Girl leaped out window. Possible suicide.<br> Morris talking.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Powell.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Looks like a packed house.<br> - Because they don't know what's in store.<br> Looks like the boyfriend.<br> - This is a very bad place to stand.<br> - Why?<br> We'll be trampled to death<br> when they start running out.<br> Poor darling. You shouldn't have told her.<br> She isn't responsible for Kay's act.<br> She is responsible. It was Kay's part.<br> It was Kay's life.<br> But now it's too late. Kay is dead.<br> - Please.<br> - Kay is dead.<br> Kay, who never harmed anyone.<br> It's all because she hasn't a heart,<br> she's made out of ice.<br> - I can't listen to you anymore. Leave.<br> - I'm leaving.<br> I will sit out front<br> because Kay asked me to be there.<br> And then every line she reads...<br> I'm gonna say<br> that should have been Kay's line.<br> Every move you make,<br> I'll say that should have been Kay.<br> Kay, who's lying in a morgue<br> all broken and alone.<br> I dare you to go on tonight.<br> - I've got to get out of here.<br> - You've got to go on.<br> Why didn't someone tell me?<br> I'd have given up a thousand parts<br> rather than have this happen.<br> I'm not going to go on<br> and I'm going to tell them why.<br> You can't think only of yourself.<br> Kay is dead.<br> You had nothing to do with that.<br> But there are 50 living people<br> dependent on you.<br> This show may mean as much to them<br> as it meant to Kay.<br> The ushers, the property men,<br> the old women who clean out the theater.<br> Each one has the right to demand<br> that you give your best performance.<br> That's the tradition of the theater.<br> Hang the tradition of the theater.<br> I'm thinking of Kay.<br> Very well, then, think of Kay.<br> Are you going to let her down?<br> You've got to give the performance<br> she wanted you to give.<br> Then perhaps, wherever she is,<br> you may bring her peace.<br> Three minutes to curtain.<br> - Miss Randall, three minutes to curtain.<br> - All right. We're coming. We're ready.<br> Pick your exit. It won't be long now.<br> Here she is now,<br> coming up the garden path.<br> - What are we going to say to her?<br> - I don't know.<br> The poor child.<br> She's probably brokenearted.<br> You'd better let me talk to her first.<br> Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad.<br> The calla lilies are in bloom again.<br> Such a strange flower.<br> Suitable to any occasion.<br> I carried them on my wedding day,<br> and now...<br> I place them here<br> in memory of something that has died.<br> He needs a good thrashing.<br> You poor child.<br> Have you gathered here to mourn,<br> or are you here to bring me comfort?<br> How could a girl like you<br> fall in love with a man like that?<br> I've learned something about love<br> that I never knew before.<br> You speak of love when it's too late.<br> Help should come to people<br> when they need it.<br> Why are we always so helpful<br> to each other when it's no longer any use?<br> My darling.<br> - Those are not the lines.<br> - No, but it's the mood.<br> This is my home. This is where I belong.<br> Love was in this house once.<br> And for me it will always be here,<br> nowhere else.<br> - Surely you're not going to see him.<br> - Of course, I'm going to see him.<br> He's coming to me today to say goodbye.<br> And one should always listen closely<br> when people say goodbye.<br> Because sometimes<br> they're really saying farewell.<br> I'm up at the theater<br> in Powell's private office.<br> Get a couple of photographers<br> over here right away.<br> This Randall girl's going over big.<br> Hear the applause?<br> Did you hear it? And wait till I tell you<br> who she is. This is plenty hot.<br> Love comes back to its ancient dwelling.<br> The old, old love that we knew of yore.<br> Terry Randall! What did I say?<br> Come on.<br> - Hold it.<br> - Take a bow.<br> - They're calling for you.<br> - Who's calling for me?<br> - You are a success, darling.<br> - They want a curtain speech.<br> Yes. Go on. Say something.<br> I suppose that I should thank you<br> on behalf of the company.<br> And I know that I'm grateful<br> to you for your applause.<br> But I must tell you that I don't deserve it.<br> I'm not responsible for what happened<br> on this stage tonight.<br> The person you should be applauding<br> died a few hours ago.<br> A young and brilliant actress who could<br> no longer find a spot in the theater.<br> And it was for her, more than<br> for anyone else, that I was able to go on.<br> And I hope that wherever she is...<br> she knows and understands...<br> and forgives.<br> That's the oddest<br> curtain speech I ever heard.<br> - Hello, Powell.<br> - How'd you like the show?<br> A little heavy, but the girl's good.<br> What in the name of time<br> was that curtain speech all about?<br> I don't know, but she's a sensation.<br> And guess what?<br> - What's that?<br> - That guy with Carmichael is her father.<br> And the laugh's on us.<br> - He's Henry Sims, the wheat king.<br> - Wheat king? What a publicity hookup.<br> Don't worry. I spread it around.<br> There's the old man now.<br> Carmichael, why are you looking so blue?<br> We've got a hit on our hands.<br> - That's what I'm afraid of.<br> - I never doubted it. Introduce me.<br> - Yes. Mr. Powell...<br> - Glad to know you, Mr. Sims.<br> You didn't fool me.<br> I knew who your daughter was.<br> To be honest,<br> this hasn't worked out the way I expected.<br> Your investment will net you $250,000.<br> What good will that do me<br> if I lose my daughter?<br> That's the price of success.<br> Brent, get a big basket of flowers,<br> send it to Randall's dressing room.<br> Put this on top. Hurry it up.<br> - Shall I put a few sprigs of wheat in it?<br> - Never mind the sarcasm.<br> Elswon'th. You're the man I'm looking for.<br> I kind of put it over on the boys, didn't I?<br> - You mean the wheat king's daughter?<br> - Yes.<br> - She doesn't need the publicity.<br> - That's why I kept it quiet.<br> She has rather a strange quality.<br> Reminds me a lot of that girl<br> you brought out last year.<br> - Yes?<br> - What was her name?<br> Hamilton.<br> - Kay Hamilton. What happened to her?<br> - She's still around.<br> Mention in your review that Randall<br> is another Anthony Powell discovery.<br> My dear, you'll never know<br> how good you were tonight.<br> You were simply wonderful.<br> That wasrt me out there tonight.<br> It was someone else.<br> It's only after we have suffered that<br> we can make the audience feel with us.<br> Does someone have to die<br> to create an actress?<br> Is that what the theater demands?<br> It takes more than greasepaint<br> and footlights to make an actress.<br> It takes heartbreak as well.<br> Don't try to say anything. We'll go to her.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - We're going to see Kay.<br> But you can't leave now.<br> There are people here.<br> The press, photographers.<br> You're an actress now.<br> You belong to those people.<br> May I come in?<br> - You see them for me.<br> - But, Terry, I...<br> - Hello. Anyone there?<br> - Coming.<br> I thought you'd never let me in.<br> - Where's Miss Randall?<br> - She's gone.<br> Gone?<br> But I've got an office full of people:<br> Reporters, society editors, photographers.<br> Why didn't you keep her here?<br> You know the theater.<br> - She had an important engagement.<br> - An engagement?<br> - What's more important than her career?<br> - It isn't my fault.<br> Of all the colossal nerve. I build a star<br> overnight, and she runs out on me.<br> I've got an office full of people,<br> and she runs off on a date.<br> - What'll I do with these?<br> - I don't care what you do with them.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Can you imagine? Of all the nerve.<br> Take a woman out of a wheat field...<br> and make a star out of her.<br> I don't deserve any better. Opening night,<br> too. That's gratitude for you.<br> Spend time and effort to build<br> a production, and they run out on you.<br> I haven't any sense to begin with.<br> Don't take it so hard, Eve.<br> It all may be a mistake.<br> I'll never put my trust in males again.<br> What's happened to Eve?<br> She's brokenearted.<br> Henry's in the cat hospital.<br> - An accident?<br> - He just had a litter of kittens.<br> That's easy.
