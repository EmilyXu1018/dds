Let's get going.<br> [Mrs. Pickett]<br> All right, Marshal, we're ready.<br> - Come on, folks, let's move.<br> - [Lieutenant] My compliments to your husband.<br> Thank you.<br> [Peacock] I still feel that we<br> ought to go back with the soldiers.<br> [Curley] We've got to hurry<br> if we wanna be there by sundown.<br> - [All Chattering]<br> - [Doc Singing]<br> Bridesmaid!

Si.<br> Good.<br> Here you are, Doc.<br> Well, what are we wasting time for?<br> Let's make a break for it.<br> - We've got a sick woman to think of.<br> - Do you want her to stay here<br> and be butchered with the rest of us?<br> - Why don't you think of somebody else for once?<br> - Do you realize who you're talking to?<br> Easy, easy! Quiet, boys. Quiet.<br> We ain't been butchered yet.<br> But you're right.<br> We'd better get going for Lordsburg<br> as soon as we can.<br> Might be a good idea, Curley, if, uh,<br> Doc took a look at the patient.<br> Yeah, and Little Coyote.<br> You'll join me, Doctor?<br> [Clears Throat]<br> No, thanks.<br> Morning.<br> Well, you're looking pretty chipper.<br> Hmm. You're up early, Dallas.<br> She didn't go to bed, Doctor.<br> I'm afraid she sat up all night<br> while I slept.<br> Oh, I slept a lot in the chair.<br> Well, anyway, it was nice to stay awake<br> and hold the baby.<br> Hmm. Well, we've got to get you<br> to Lordsburg, Little Coyote.<br> That's what the boys christened her last night<br> when she squalled - Little Coyote.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Fine, thanks. A little tired.<br> - Doctor, do you think my husband -<br> - Never mind him.<br> The best medicine he can have<br> is to see you two safe and sound.<br> You just make up your mind<br> you're gonna get there.<br> - I have made up my mind.<br> - That's the stuff.<br> - I am going to get there.<br> - You need strength, so get all the rest you can.<br> Dallas, do you suppose<br> you can fix up a little broth?<br> - She has already.<br> - Good.<br> How about making some coffee<br> for the boys?<br> Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.<br> And don't look so proud.<br> I've brought hundreds<br> of those little fellas into the world...<br> once upon a time.<br> And the new one<br> was always the prettiest.<br> Doc.<br> Ringo asked me to marry him.<br> Is that wrong for a girl like me?<br> If a man and woman love each other,<br> it's all right, ain't it, Doc?<br> You're going to be hurt, child.<br> Worse than you've ever been hurt.<br> Don't you know that boy's<br> headed back for prison?<br> Besides, if you two<br> go into Lordsburg together...<br> he's going to know all about you.<br> He's not goin' into Lordsburg.<br> All I want is for you<br> to tell me it's all right.<br> Gosh, child, who am I to tell you<br> what's right or wrong?<br> All right. Go ahead.<br> Do it if you can.<br> Good luck.<br> Thanks, Doc.<br> - Ringo -<br> - [Curley] Well, Doc?<br> Oh, both doing nicely.<br> She's a real soldier's wife,<br> that young lady.<br> Good, good.<br> Then we can leave immediately.<br> Well, not for a day or so<br> if you want my professional advice.<br> What do you mean a day?<br> Stay another day? Why?<br> Where were you when the stork<br> came last night, Gatewood?<br> I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel<br> until she and the child are out of danger.<br> What do you mean danger?<br> Aren't we in worse danger here?<br> [Clears Throat]<br> I don't wish to intrude.<br> But I've had five children.<br> I mean, my dear wife has.<br> And much as I dislike discussing it,<br> in this hour of our trial...<br> I - I believe the doctor's right.<br> Spoken like a man, Reverend.<br> I say we ought to leave here before the<br> Apaches find us. That's common sense.<br> I wish you were 10 years younger,<br> Gatewood.<br> - Don't let my white hairs stop you -<br> - Now just a minute!<br> - [Both Shouting]<br> - Quiet! Quiet!<br> - Now, Curley, I haven't said a word!<br> - Will you shut up!<br> Now, if we argue this thing out right,<br> we can get somewhere.<br> Let's all sit down and talk sensible.<br> Come on, Buck. Sit down.<br> There's a young woman in the kitchen<br> making coffee.<br> She needs help.<br> Thanks, Doc.<br> Say, Kid.<br> How old were you<br> when you went to the pen?<br> Oh, I was... goin' on 17.<br> [Grinding]<br> Mornin', ma'am.<br> Morning.<br> I, uh, laid awake most of the night...<br> wondering what you'd have said<br> if Curley hadn't busted in.<br> Guess you was up kind of late too.<br> I could hear you moving around.<br> You didn't answer<br> what I asked you last night.<br> Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?<br> There's a horse out there in the corral.<br> Curley won't go after you because he can't<br> leave the passengers in a fix like this.<br> I gotta go to Lordsburg.<br> Why don't you go to my ranch<br> and wait for me?<br> Wait for a dead man.<br> You haven't got a chance.<br> It was three against one when the Plummers swore<br> that you killed their foreman, got you sent up.<br> It'll be three against one in Lordsburg.<br> Well, there's some things a man<br> just can't run away from.<br> How can you talk about your life and my life<br> when you're throwing them away?<br> Yeah. Mine too.<br> That's what you're throwing away<br> if you go to Lordsburg.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Would it make us any happier<br> if Luke Plummer was dead?<br> One of his brothers<br> would be after you with a gun.<br> We'd never be safe.<br> I don't want that kind of life, Ringo.<br> Well, I don't see what else I can do.<br> Go now. Get away.<br> Forget Lordsburg. Forget the Plummers.<br> Make for the border, and I'll come to you.<br> - Do you mean that?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Will you go with me, Dallas?<br> Oh, I can't leave Mrs. Mallory<br> and the baby.<br> I'll come to you from Lordsburg.<br> I swear it.<br> Well, I oughta have a rifle and -<br> I've got one. Right here.<br> - I got it last night when they were all asleep.<br> - You mean you thought of this last night?<br> Yeah. Don't ask any more questions.<br> Not now.<br> Aw, gosh, Curley,<br> there ain't no Apaches behind us.<br> Aw, gosh, Curley,<br> there ain't no Apaches behind us.<br> We can still go back to Tonto.<br> - No! I insist we go on to Lordsburg.<br> - What do you think, Chris?<br> Geronimo between here and Lordsburg -<br> with my horse, I think.<br> - [Chuckles] My horse has gone<br> - No, Doctor. Oh!
