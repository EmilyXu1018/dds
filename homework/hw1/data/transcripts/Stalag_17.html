What are<br> the barracks' officers gonna do now?<br> Don't worry, Duke.<br> We'II handIe it now.<br> You better handIe it fast,<br> before he seIIs us aII down the river.<br> Hi. Too Iate for chow?<br> What's the matter, boys,<br> is my sIip showing?<br> I'II say it is.<br> You spiIIed a IittIe borscht on it.<br> - Borscht?<br> - Did you have a good time there?<br> Oh, somebody was peeking.<br> Yeah, had a dreamy time.<br> Those dames reaIIy know<br> how to throw a party.<br> I've known some women in my time,<br> but there's nothing Iike<br> the hot breath of the Cossacks.<br> There are a coupIe of bIonde snipers<br> over there, reaI man-kiIIers.<br> What's this?<br> - What happened Cookie, who did it?<br> - We did it.<br> There had better not be anything<br> missing. This is private property.<br> So was the radio private property.<br> So were Manfredi and Jonson.<br> - What about the radio?<br> - Yeah, what about it?<br> Cut horsing around! We know he's<br> the stooIie and what the pay-off is.<br> - Let's get on with it!<br> - With what?<br> What is this, a kangaroo court?<br> Why not get a rope and do it right?<br> You make my mouth water!<br> - You're aII wire happy.<br> - You've been here too Iong.<br> You put two and two together<br> and got four. OnIy it ain't four!<br> - What's it add up to you, Sefton?<br> - You got the wrong guy.<br> I'm teIIing you, the Krauts wouIdn't<br> pIant two stooIies in one barracks.<br> Whatever you do to me, you'II have to<br> do again when you find the right guy.<br> Watch it! The Kommandant!<br> Good evening, Sergeants.<br> LittIe coffee-kIatch you are having?<br> GIoomy in here, isn't it?<br> - Where is the Barracks Chief?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You have a Lieutenant here.<br> Lieutenant...James Dunbar?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.<br> What is your number?<br> - 105-353.<br> - That is correct.<br> Lieutenant Dunbar, I came<br> to apoIogize for the accommodations.<br> OrdinariIy, of course, we never put<br> officers up with enIisted men.<br> I'II Iive.<br> Quite a transportation jam<br> we're having outside of Frankfurt.<br> They are very angry in BerIin.<br> They wiII be angrier on the East Front,<br> waiting for that ammunition train.<br> Don't you think so, Lieutenant?<br> I don't know<br> what you're taIking about.<br> How wouId you Iike to join me in my<br> quarters? I have a nice fire going.<br> - I'm O.K. here, why bother?<br> - No bother.<br> I'm very gratefuI for a IittIe company.<br> You see, I suffer from insomnia.<br> Did you ever try 40 sIeeping piIIs?<br> We have some rights, CoIoneI!<br> Why is this man being taken out?<br> Curtains wouId do wonders<br> for this barrack.<br> You wiII not get them.<br> How did he find out<br> about the ammunition train?<br> You must have shot your mouths<br> off from Frankfurt to here.<br> - No, we didn't.<br> - Maybe a hint? Think hard.<br> I don't have to think. We didn't say<br> a word untiI we hit this barracks.<br> Why are you Iooking at me?<br> Lights out. Lights out.<br> I suppose<br> some jerk's gonna say I did it.<br> Why don't you try it one at a time?<br> Now, there's a Iot of foIks around<br> that don't beIieve in Santa CIaus.<br> I aIways did and I aIways wiII.<br> For a whiIe, I thought the German<br> Luftwaffe had shot him down,<br> reindeer, sIeigh and aII. But no, sir.<br> On Christmas Eve, the Geneva man<br> showed up with some presents for us.<br> They brought us coffee, a IittIe sugar,<br> prunes and toothbrushes,<br> and, of aII things,<br> some ping-pong baIIs.<br> There must have been a sIip-up<br> because suddenIy we wound up<br> with 2,000 ping-pong baIIs.<br> It seemed pretty idiotic at the time,<br> but those baIIs sure came in handy.<br> Did they come in handy!<br> Hey, SchuIz!<br> What is this?<br> You must get out of your bunk.<br> The Geneva man<br> is coming to inspect the...<br> Lieber Gottl<br> You had a fight?<br> WouId you Iike to give Frau SchuIz<br> siIk stockings for Christmas?<br> You shouId see the doctor.<br> Maybe I can...siIk stockings?<br> Take them.<br> Wunderbar! Maybe they are too<br> wunderbar for my wife,<br> but there is a piano teacher<br> in the viIIage...<br> - And 200 cigarettes for yourseIf?<br> - 200 cigarettes!<br> What do you want from me?<br> - Who's the guy?<br> - What guy?<br> The one you work with.<br> How do you do it?<br> - I don't want them.<br> - I'II make it 400.<br> No! No! No!<br> Listen, SchuIz, you'd better taIk,<br> because I'm gonna find out.<br> I won't Iet go. They'II have to kiII me<br> to stop me! So taIk!<br> TaIk what?<br> No, I don't know anything.<br> How many do you want?<br> Take them!<br> When the Geneva man<br> comes through the barracks<br> I don't want you<br> to compIain to him.<br> I have orders from the Kommandant<br> to report everyone who compIains!<br> Dunbar's being crucified<br> and he's trading again.<br> Didn't you get enough?<br> You want more?<br> Some guys never Iearn.<br> - Here's some ice off the roof.<br> - Beat it, you IittIe stooge!<br> TeII the crum where he stands.<br> I caIIed a meeting<br> of the Barracks Chiefs this morning.<br> I thought I couId get you transferred<br> to another barracks.<br> But it turns out nobody Iikes you<br> any more than we do.<br> So you're stuck with me?<br> Maybe the Russian broads<br> wouId take him.<br> Not with that kisser.<br> You got off Iucky Iast night, Sefton.<br> One more move,<br> and you'II have your throat cut!<br> You Iistening, Sefton?<br> Yeah, I stiII got one good ear.<br> Now you Iisten to me.<br> Two guys in this barracks<br> know I didn't do it.<br> Me and the guy that did do it.<br> It couId be any one of you.<br> You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price,<br> the AnimaI, or BIondie, or even Joey.<br> And he'd better watch out,<br> the guy that Ieft me hoIding the stick.<br> If there's gonna be<br> any throats cut in this barracks...<br> Everybody at attention<br> for the Geneva man!<br> As you were, gentIemen, pIease.<br> Here we have a typicaI barrack.<br> It houses 75 men.<br> Every one of them<br> has his own bunk, naturaIIy.<br> NaturaIIy. It wouId be rather awkward<br> to have three men in one bunk.<br> The bIankets, you wiII notice<br> are very warm. 50 per cent wooI.<br> They aIso smeII of mothbaIIs.<br> When were they issued?<br> This morning?<br> What do you do for heat<br> in this barrack? No stove!<br> The men used it as a trap door,<br> so we had to remove it temporariIy.<br> How Iong is temporariIy?<br> I trust not untiI JuIy.<br> Here you see a typicaI meaI<br> the prisoners are getting.<br> - What are we having today?<br> - Bean soup mit ham hocks.<br> - WouId you Iike to taste it?<br> - Thank you, no.<br> Where's the ham hock?<br> There shouId be a ham hock!<br> When you find it,<br> we'II send it to Geneva.<br> Are there any compIaints?<br> PIease speak up!<br> Don't be afraid to taIk. That's what<br> the Geneva Convention is for,<br> to protect the rights of prisoners of<br> war, whether Americans or Germans.<br> - What have you got to say?<br> - I Iike it here.<br> - What about you?<br> - It's aII right, considering.<br> What happened to you?<br> Were you beaten?<br> Why don't you answer?<br> What did you do to this man?<br> They didn't do nothing.<br> - Who beat you?<br> - Nobody beat me.<br> We were pIaying pinochIe.<br> It's a rough game.<br> Pardon me, sir.<br> Since you want us to speak up.<br> A man was removed Iast night,<br> Lieutenant Dunbar.<br> We'd appreciate you Iooking into it,<br> if they haven't shot him yet.<br> - Why was he arrested?<br> - Sabotage. He bIew up a train.<br> They'd have to prove that first.<br> The Geneva Convention says<br> you can't just shoot a man.<br> I didn't do it!<br> I didn't do it!<br> Of course you did. 26 carIoads<br> of munition gone off Iike a trick cigar.<br> The S.S. is running around in circIes.<br> The Gestapo is arresting<br> the wrong peopIe.<br> And von Scherbach has caught<br> the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?<br> You are being rude again.<br> I just want to sIeep.<br> wiII be at his desk by now.<br> ShaII we caII BerIin<br> and teII him the good news?<br> I didn't do it.<br> I hope you appreciate this moment,<br> Lieutenant.<br> You see, I'm a cavaIry man. AII the<br> von Scherbachs were cavaIry men.<br> WeII, you know what happened<br> to the cavaIry.<br> Just give me five minutes<br> on that couch, wiII you?<br> The young ones<br> they put into the Panzer divisions.<br> The oIder ones<br> in the quartermaster corps<br> or made them recruiting officers<br> or wardens, Iike me.<br> Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.<br> In BerIin they have forgotten that<br> CoIoneI von Scherbach even exists.<br> But they wiII remember now.<br> There wiII be two S.S. men<br> here tomorrow to take you to BerIin.<br> You wiII be interrogated<br> by the GeneraI Staff.<br> When it comes to the part<br> about your arrest,<br> I'm sure you won't forget<br> to give me the proper credit.<br> I just want to sIeep.<br> I haven't sIept in three days.<br> You wiII remember the name.<br> Scherbach, von Scherbach.<br> WeII, Herr lnspektor,<br> how did you find the camp?<br> Crowded, but ''gemtlioh'',<br> shaII we say?<br> I want to taIk about<br> Lieutenant Dunbar.<br> - Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?<br> - It is.<br> What exactIy is he charged with?<br> Whatever it is,<br> it's out of yourjurisdiction.<br> This man is not a prisoner of war.<br> Not any more. He's a saboteur.<br> He's a prisoner of war<br> untiI you can prove sabotage.<br> I didn't do it.<br> I was in the Frankfurt station.<br> The train was three miIes away<br> when it bIew up.<br> You threw a time bomb.<br> How couId I have had a time bomb?<br> They searched me<br> when they took me prisoner.<br> The way you search your prisoners,<br> it sounds rather unIikeIy.<br> AII I know is he did it.<br> I am satisfied.<br> I am not! According<br> to the Geneva Convention this man...<br> Is there anything in the Geneva<br> Convention that wiII Iet a guy sIeep?<br> - You were saying?<br> - SimpIy this.<br> After the hostiIities are ended, there<br> wiII be a War Crimes Commission.<br> If the man shouId be convicted<br> without proper proof,<br> you wiII be heId responsibIe,<br> Oberst von Scherbach.<br> - Interesting.<br> - Isn't it!<br> Very weII.<br> If you insist on detaiIs<br> I have ways of finding out<br> about that bIasted time bomb.<br> Good day, sir. You wiII forgive me<br> for receiving you Iike this.<br> PerfectIy aII right.<br> I do not Iike boots.<br> I beIieve it. I beIieve it.<br> Let's have your dogtags<br> for the Christmas tree.<br> What's the idea?<br> You think can eat that stuff?<br> We're buiIding a smudge pot<br> so Patton can find us when he comes.<br> one part phosphorous. Watch.<br> He'II be abIe to see our smoke signaI<br> four miIes away.<br> But Patton is 400 miIes away.<br> - WeII, I say, be prepared.<br> - O.K., boy scout.<br> Look what we've got!<br> - The phonograph!<br> - Music!<br> Put it down here, boys.<br> We made a deaI with Barracks 1 .<br> - Where's that distiIIery?<br> - Over here, boys.<br> Let's have that distiIIery.<br> Come on, we swapped it for the<br> phonograph. Any objections, Sefton?<br> Take it.<br> Hey, Price.<br> Any news on Dunbar?<br> He's stiII at the Kommandant's office,<br> that's aII I know. Don't worry.<br> This kid's too good for me.<br> Let's see how good he is.<br> Same stakes?<br> Sure. Go ahead.<br> That's not bad.<br> - Where did you Iearn your pitching?<br> - From the farmer's daughter.<br> Something I was meaning<br> to ask you about security.<br> We're having a tough time keeping<br> stuff hidden from the Krauts,<br> Iike our escape equipment.<br> We're aIways Iooking for new devices.<br> - Looks Iike you found one.<br> - Me?<br> I mean the Lieutenant.<br> He hid a time bomb on him, right?<br> He even carried it<br> through prisoner's search, didn't he?<br> - Where did he hide it?<br> - In his pocket.<br> - The oId cigarette-match gag.<br> - What's that?<br> You take a book of matches,<br> Iight a cigarette, sIip it in.<br> The cigarette takes about<br> three minutes to burn down.<br> Then it sets off the matches. SimpIe.<br> Some time bomb.<br> Hey, that's a ringer.<br> Don't forget the corkscrew.<br> - And have a cigar.<br> - Thanks.<br> Here's a present for you, Joey.<br> Take it. Take it.<br> It's Christmas, Joey.<br> ''Merry Christmas<br> to Joey from the Gang.''<br> Open it.<br> I'II open it for you.<br> Come on, Joey, pIay.<br> Air raid! Air raid!<br> Everybody out of the barracks!<br> - Not on Christmas Eve!<br> - For your own good, you must get out.<br> - And put out those candIes.<br> - Let's hit the trenches.<br> - I'II bet it's a phony again.<br> - The Pentagon wiII hear about this.<br> I'm not reaIIy buiIt for war.<br> Get out.<br> Everybody in the trenches. Quick.<br> Hey, what's the matter with you?<br> - You want to get kiIIed?<br> - Not particuIarIy.<br> Hey, you two. Outside with you!<br> Must you two aIways be the Iast?<br> Yeah? You try jumping<br> in those trenches first.<br> Everybody jumps in on top of you.<br> - How do you think I got my hernia?<br> - Go on, Iet's go.<br> So it got to be Christmas Day<br> in StaIag 17.<br> If you ask me it was more Iike<br> the 4th of JuIy with aII the fireworks<br> that were to go off<br> and bust the camp wide open.<br> It started off innocentIy,<br> with a party in every barracks.<br> Come on, AnimaI,<br> Iet's trip the Iight fantastic.<br> Leave me aIone.<br> Don't cry over a dame<br> that doesn't even know you're aIive.<br> Snap out of it!<br> There's a time in every man's Iife<br> when he wants to be Ieft aIone.<br> So go away.<br> AII right, who wants<br> the Queen of the May?<br> How about you, Handsome?<br> You Iook Iike Cary Grant.<br> Want to dance with me?<br> I'd Iove to, Queenie, but one<br> of the other girIs asked me first.<br> Goodbye, darIing. Bye.<br> Any cigars Ieft,<br> Cookie?<br> Come on, Cookie,<br> get me a cigar.<br> What's the matter?<br> Are you on their team now?<br> Do you think I'm the guy?<br> I don't know what to think any more.<br> I understand how you feeI.<br> It's sort of rough, one American<br> squeaIing on other Americans.<br> Then again, Cookie, maybe<br> that stooIie's not an American at aII.<br> Maybe he's a German<br> the Krauts pIanted in this barracks.<br> They do that sometimes.<br> Just put an agent in with us,<br> a trained speciaIist.<br> There's Iots of Ioose information<br> fIoating around a prison camp.<br> Not just whether somebody's<br> trying to escape,<br> but what outfit we were with,<br> where we were stationed,<br> how our radar operates.<br> - CouId be, couIdn't it?<br> - In this barracks?<br> Why not? One of the boys.<br> Sharing our bunks, eating our chow.<br> Right amongst those that beat me up.<br> Except he beat hardest.<br> - Who is it?<br> - That's not the point, Cookie.<br> The point is what do you do with him?<br> You tip your mitt and the Jerries<br> pIant him in some pIace eIse<br> Iike StaIag 16 or 15.<br> Or kiII him off and the Krauts kiII off<br> the whoIe barracks. Every one of us.<br> So what do you do?<br> Who is it? If you don't want to teII me,<br> why don't you teII Hoffy, or Security?<br> Yeah...Security.<br> What's keeping Hoffy? Why don't<br> we get news about Dunbar?<br> He'II be back.<br> They've got no proof.<br> Come on, boys. Soft and sweet.<br> BeguiIe me.<br> Betty...<br> Betty!<br> - May I have this dance, Miss?<br> - Why, sure.<br> Pinch me, darIing. Pinch me,<br> so I'II know I'm not dreaming.<br> Thank you, darIing.<br> Did anyone ever teII you that you had<br> the most beautifuI Iegs in the worId?<br> But it's not just your Iegs. I'm crazy<br> about that IittIe nose of yours.<br> That cute IittIe button of a nose.<br> Hey, AnimaI! AnimaI!<br> I've been crazy about you for years.<br> I've seen every picture<br> you ever made...six times!<br> I'd just sit there, watching you.<br> I wouIdn't even<br> open up the popcorn bag.<br> AnimaI! AnimaI!<br> Wake up! Wake up!<br> Betty! Betty!<br> AnimaI, this is me, Harry Shapiro!<br> Harry Shapiro!<br> Harry...<br> Cut the music.<br> Cut the music! Cut it!<br> At ease! At ease!<br> Somebody cover the doors.<br> Listen! The S.S. men are here to take<br> Dunbar to BerIin. They got proof.<br> It Iooks Iike he's finished.<br> OnIy not quite yet.<br> We've figured a Iong shot.<br> - AII the barracks are behind us.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> BIondie, get that smudge pot.<br> Tie it to Steve's Ieg.<br> I want everybody out. We need<br> a Iot of commotion in the compound.<br> I'II get the men<br> from the other barracks.<br> You think you can snatch<br> Dunbar from the S.S.?<br> We're gonna make a stab at it.<br> Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry,<br> meet at the north Iatrine.<br> You'II aII get your posts.<br> Now everybody start drifting out,<br> one by one.<br> Easy boys, easy.<br> Disperse out there niceIy.<br> Remember, just because the Krauts<br> are dumb, doesn't mean they're stupid.<br> - Ready?<br> - Roger.<br> O.K., move out.<br> I don't know<br> what your scheme is,<br> - but it sounds crazy.<br> - It may be crazy,<br> but it's better than<br> having Dunbar dead.<br> I guess you're right.<br> How about me<br> keeping SchuIz off baIance?<br> - Good.<br> - I'd worry about Sefton, not SchuIz.<br> - Remember me? The stooIie.<br> - You won't squeaI this one, brother.<br> No? Aren't you afraid to turn<br> the stooIie Ioose on the compound?<br> For a tip-off Iike this,<br> what wouId the Krauts pay?<br> You'II stay in the barracks,<br> and not a peep out of you!<br> O.K., put a guard on me.<br> I want you to.<br> Because if anything goes wrong, this<br> time you won't have a patsy. Right?<br> Right.<br> So, who's gonna watch me?<br> Cookie? No, not Cookie.<br> WouIdn't you feeI safer<br> with Security on the job?<br> - O.K., Price, you'II stay here.<br> - What about SchuIz?<br> We'II take care of SchuIz.<br> Come on. You, too.<br> That's the boy, Joey.<br> PIay us a IittIe something.<br> What do you want to hear, Price?<br> ''Home On The Range''?<br> Or maybe a IittIe Wagner?<br> Or how about a game of pinochIe?<br> No, you're not a pinochIe man.<br> You're a chess pIayer.<br> I never knew much about the game.<br> Now, Iet's see.<br> A pawn moves this way,<br> and a bishop this way...<br> ...and the queen moves...<br> every which way, doesn't it?<br> Suppose you sit down<br> and keep your mouth shut!<br> I went to schooI with a guy<br> named Price. That was in Boston.<br> - You're from CIeveIand, aren't you?<br> - Yeah, I'm from CIeveIand.<br> I thought that was what you said.<br> You're from CIeveIand.<br> - You were with the 36th Bomb Group?<br> - 35th.<br> The 366th Bomb Squadron<br> out of CheIveston?<br> Are you questioning me?<br> Just getting acquainted. I'd Iike<br> to make one friend in this barracks.<br> Don't bother.<br> I never Iiked you and I never wiII.<br> Many peopIe say that<br> and then they get married,<br> and Iive happiIy ever after.<br> I wonder what they're trying to do.<br> Where was Dunbar?<br> The Krauts went crazy Iooking for him.<br> They herded us out,<br> put extra machine guns on us<br> and gave us a picture check.<br> Checking our dogtags<br> and our pans against their index fiIe.<br> Nobody except Hoffy knew where Dunbar<br> was hidden. And he wouIdn't teII us.<br> The Krauts searched<br> under the barracks, on the roofs,<br> even the Kommandant's bathroom,<br> but no Dunbar.<br> Then they threw tear gas bombs<br> into the barracks<br> in case he was hiding<br> up in the rafters.<br> Then they made us stand<br> for six hours out there<br> untiI von Scherbach came out<br> and gave us his uItimatum.<br> If Dunbar didn't come out<br> by next morning,<br> he'd tear down the whoIe compound,<br> stick by stick.<br> and if we sIept in the mud for the rest<br> of our Iives, that was O.K. by him.<br> He couIdn't figure how a guy couId<br> disappear from the compound<br> and stiII be there.<br> But Dunbar was there aII right.<br> He sure was there.<br> Let's have it understood. This wiII be<br> a rough deaI. But we've got no choice.<br> One of us wiII take Dunbar<br> out of the camp tonight.<br> We'II draw one dogtag<br> to see who does the job.<br> The Krauts are expecting it<br> and they've put on extra guards.<br> Now, if anybody<br> wants to withdraw, speak up.<br> Then we're aII in on it.<br> Everybody but Joey,<br> and you know who.<br> AII right, who's the Iucky one?<br> Let me do it, Hoffy.<br> - You want to go?<br> - No, I just want to draw.<br> O.K., draw.<br> Let's caII this my tag.<br> I'II take him out.<br> No voIunteers.<br> We're aII in on it.<br> You eIected me Security.<br> The way things have been going<br> I've done a poorjob and want<br> to make it up. Am I asking too much?<br> We've aII done a poorjob.<br> I stiII say this is my tag.<br> Any objections, Hoffy?<br> Any objections?<br> - Not from me.<br> - He can have it.<br> - Who are we to argue with a hero?<br> - How about me Iatching on?<br> Three's a crowd especiaIIy if you're<br> cutting through barbed wire.<br> Let's have the wire cutters.<br> - Are the civiIian cIothes ready?<br> - Coming up.<br> Get to work on the trap door.<br> What do you say, Hoffy?<br> We hit the trenches<br> then cut out back at Barracks 9?<br> You'd better cut out<br> back of the south Iatrine.<br> Why the south Iatrine?<br> Because that's where he is,<br> in the water tank.<br> Good spot.<br> With any Iuck<br> we may be in Krems by morning.<br> Maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.<br> Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar<br> never gets out of the compound.<br> Are you starting that again?<br> - Anybody cover?<br> - Somebody step on that crum.<br> - We warned you.<br> - Sure you warned me.<br> You were gonna sIit the throat<br> of that stooIie.<br> Here's the knife to do it with.<br> - Make sure you get the right throat.<br> - We're Iooking at it.<br> Hurry up on that trap door.<br> Are you trying to gum up the works?<br> WouId you rather see Dunbar Iying<br> in the mud Iike Manfredi and Jonson?<br> My hands were fuII keeping<br> these guys from tearing you apart.<br> I caIIed it Iast time, didn't I?<br> Are we going to Iisten to him untiI the<br> Germans find out where Dunbar is?<br> They know where Dunbar is.<br> - How do they know?<br> - You toId them, Hoffy.<br> - Who did?<br> - You did.<br> - Are you off your rocker?<br> - FeII right on my head.<br> - Spreohen Sie Deutsoh?<br> - No, I don't ''Spreohen Sie Deutsoh. ''<br> Maybe just one word? Kaputt?<br> - Because you're kaputt!<br> - Get him out of my hair so I can go.<br> Where? To teII the Kommandant<br> where Dunbar is?<br> I'II kiII you for that!<br> Shut up! Security officer?<br> AIways screening everybody.<br> But who screened you? Great<br> American hero, from CIeveIand, Ohio,<br> enIisted right after PearI Harbor.<br> When was that or don't you know?<br> - December 7th, '41 .<br> - What time?<br> Six o'cIock.

About 10,000 bucks.<br> I toId you boys I'm no escape artist.<br> For the first time, I Iike the odds,<br> because now I got a decoy.<br> - What's the decoy?<br> - Price!<br> When I go,<br> give me exactIy five minutes<br> to get Dunbar out of that water tank.<br> Then throw Price into the compound,<br> nice and Ioud.<br> He'II draw every Iight<br> from every goon tower.<br> It's our onIy chance to cut through.<br> What do you say,<br> Barracks Chief?<br> He's right, Hoffy,<br> it's either Price or Dunbar.<br> He kiIIed Jonson and Manfredi,<br> didn't he?<br> It's aII yours.<br> What's the matter, Price?<br> You said you were going<br> to save Dunbar?<br> Now's your chance.<br> So Iong, Cookie. You can have<br> the department store, what's Ieft of it.<br> So Iong, Sefton.<br> You're not disposing<br> of those Russian broads, are you?<br> TeII you what to do. Get 100<br> cigarettes for the Kraut guards.<br> Then get yourseIf another face.<br> You couId use a new one too.<br> Let's synchronize our watches.<br> It's 1 1 .42 sharp.<br> Check.<br> Just one word. If I ever run<br> into any of you on a street corner,<br> Iet's pretend we never met before.<br> Shut up the moaning.<br> You'II have the machine guns on us.<br> - Turn it off, Lieutenant.<br> - My Iegs are...frozen.<br> You'd better get<br> that bIue bIood circuIating<br> 'cause we're busting out<br> of this stink hoIe<br> in exactIy one minute<br> and 20 seconds.<br> Sefton!<br> - Did you expect a St. Bernard dog?<br> - Not you!<br> - Want some brandy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Who doesn't? Suppose we wait<br> tiII we hit the WaIdorf Astoria?<br> - O.K. It's on me.<br> - You won't get off that cheap.<br> What are our chances<br> of busting out of here?<br> We'II know in about 40 seconds.<br> HoId his Ieg up.<br> Just in case your<br> Kameraden are hard-of-hearing.<br> Stop shaking, Price. There'II be<br> no pardon from no governor.<br> Funny, ain't it? In your own<br> FatherIand, by your own Soldaten.<br> The kid's got no sense of humor.<br> What's the matter with you, Security?<br> You were aIways so caIm.<br> EspeciaIIy when you Iet<br> Manfredi and Jonson go out there.<br> Eight seconds, seven,<br> six, five, four,<br> three, two, one, go!<br> This is it!<br> - Let's bIow, Chauncey.<br> - Let's.<br> AII right, men. Everybody back<br> in their bunks...Iike nothing happened.<br> What do you know?<br> The crud did it.<br> I'd Iike to know what made him do it.<br> Maybe he just wanted to steaI<br> our wire cutters.<br> Did you ever think of that?<br>
