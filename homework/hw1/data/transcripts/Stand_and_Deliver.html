The absence of value.<br> True story.<br> You burros have math in your blood.<br> Kimo sabe todo.<br> The man knows everything!<br> Parenthesis means multiply.<br> Every time you see this, multiply.<br> A negative times a negative<br> equals a positive.<br> "A negative times a negative<br> equals a positive."

Ed. Instructor.<br> As I said before...<br> ...we lack the resources to implement<br> the changes the district demands.<br> Mr. Sanzaki,<br> you must have at least one comment.<br> This may not be the right time<br> to say this, but...<br> ...I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back<br> after Christmas.<br> I got a job with aerospace.<br> How much money?<br> We have the remainder of the year<br> before we're put on probation.<br> - If we fail, we lose accreditation.<br> - If we fail?<br> You can't teach logarithms to illiterates.<br> These kids come to us<br> with barely a 7th grade education.<br> There isn't a teacher in this room<br> who isn't doing everything he possibly can.<br> I'm not. I could teach more.<br> I'm sure Mr. Escalante<br> has good intentions...<br> ...but he's only been here a few months.<br> Students will rise to the level<br> of expectations, Seor Molina.<br> What do you need, Mr. Escalante?<br> Ganas. All we need is ganas.<br> What's ganas?<br> We will begin each class with a quiz.<br> There will be no free rides, no excuses.<br> You already have two strikes against you.<br> There are some people in this world...<br> ...who assume that you know less<br> than you do...<br> ...because of your name<br> and your complexion...<br> ...but math is the great equalizer.<br> When you go for a job, the employer...<br> ...will not want to hear your problems.<br> Neither do I.<br> You'll work harder<br> than you ever worked before.<br> And the only thing I ask<br> from you is ganas...<br> ...desire... a haircut.<br> If you don't have the ganas,<br> I will give it to you because I am an expert.<br> Today is Monday,<br> tomorrow is Wednesday...<br> ...Friday is payday, the weekly test.<br> There will be no diagonal vision.<br> Keep your eyes on your own paper.<br> You have 10 minutes to finish.<br> If you finish early, start the assignment<br> on the board. No questions? Good.<br> Angel, vmonos!<br> I was said to go here.<br> Nice knowing you.<br> Have a good day. Arrivederci!<br> You're in luck. Take the seat.<br> Relax, take Sominex.<br> Don't sleep in my class.<br> I take that as an insult.<br> Kimo, I want to talk to you about the class.<br> You ain't got a seat. Don't give me no gas.<br> I know about that. It was a mistake.<br> I'm gonna fly straight, but I got a problem.<br> Yeah, me.<br> Seriously. Books.<br> The homies can't see me<br> haul them around.<br> You don't want anyone to think<br> you're intelligent.<br> Maybe I can have two books,<br> keep one stashed at home.<br> I'll cut you a deal.<br> I'll give you three books.<br> Take one home. One for your class.<br> This one is broken.<br> One for your locker,<br> so nobody sees you carrying it around.<br> Easily understood?<br> What do I get?<br> Protection, Kimo.<br> Proteccin, understand?<br> I understand.<br> I understand.<br> That's the only reason<br> I'm still in Kimo's class.<br> Don't tell her that you dig her.<br> That's the worst thing you can do<br> with a woman.<br> I'm fed up with this peln we got<br> for a teacher.<br> Escalante has a bug up his ass.<br> He's from South America.<br> He's probably a Nazi come out of hiding.<br> Don't you know?<br> Garfield can't get accredited.<br> Only teachers who act like assholes<br> will keep their jobs.<br> What if we all decide not to take this test?<br> He can't fail the whole class.<br> Mutiny. That's cool.<br> See you guys later.<br> Camejo thinks she's hot<br> because she dates gabachos.<br> If we don't do better today, heads will roll.<br> I've never gotten lower<br> than a B+ in my life.<br> Because you take those<br> Mickey Mouse classes.<br> Always get an A.<br> Here you have a chance for a solid D.<br> You got 10 minutes.<br> Here he comes.<br> Watch this.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> I'm not taking the quiz.<br> You didn't turn in your homework.<br> My goat ate it.<br> You don't do your homework,<br> you don't get a ticket to watch the show.<br> Give her the chair!<br> Shit.<br> Chair! Chair! Chair!<br> Shut up!<br> Get back to your tests.<br> You've got less than nine minutes.<br> Now you're the show.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Are you the dumb student? Come on!<br> You'll have to do it anyway.<br> Kids go to bed?<br> Papa go to work?<br> Can I fix you something to eat?<br> Mija, could you please turn off that light?<br> Orale, homeboy.<br> Teacher time, ese.<br> Tell Kimo I say, "Qu hubo?", ese.<br> Oh, shit man!<br> Green light, red light?<br> Anybody?<br> Late! Late, Angel!<br> - Go see the counselor.<br> - Come on, Kimo.<br> Go to wood shop, make a shoeshine box.<br> You'll need it.<br> You're the man, you know.<br> Why don't you put them in college, huh?<br> So dumb taco benders like me...<br> ...can pick their vegetables...<br> ...collect their garbage...<br> ...clip their poodle's toenails.<br> I may be a sinner...<br> ...but I'm willing to pay for my sins.<br> One-shot deal. Go sit down.<br> See you at 3:00.<br> Go to hell.<br> I got more bad news for you.<br> What I'm going to say will trip you out.<br> Mr. Escalante, I forgot my pencil.<br> He can have mine.<br> Today is my last day.<br> Did you enjoy your taquitos?<br> Except for one thing.<br> Someone doesn't know how to add.<br> She should be back in school.<br> Papa, this is Mr. Escalante,<br> my math teacher.<br> Can you sit with us?<br> Anita, bring us a couple of beers.<br> You should get another waitress.<br> Ana can be the first in your family<br> to graduate and go to college.<br> I thank you for your concern.<br> Her mother, sisters,<br> and brothers work here.<br> This is a family business. She is needed.<br> She could help the family more<br> by getting an education.<br> She'd probably get pregnant.<br> She wouldn't finish college.<br> Anita, go help your mom in the kitchen.<br> She talks about going to medical school.<br> I don't think so.<br> She should make her own choices.<br> She'll just get fat.<br> She'll waste her life here. She's a top kid!<br> I started washing dishes<br> for a nickel an hour.<br> Now I own this place.<br> Did I waste my life?<br> I washed dishes too<br> when I came to America.<br> Good!<br> Put on an apron and give us a hand.<br> Your husband comes<br> to my restaurant, eats...<br> ...then insults me.<br> Excuse my husband, Mr. Delgado.<br> He just wants what's best for Ana.<br> She could go to college,<br> then teach you how to run the place.<br> Professor?<br> I don't want your money<br> and I don't need your business.<br> Skip it. Tip.<br> He puts hot chili in his dip<br> to sell extra beer.<br> Dog, dog, dog, dog!<br> Everybody look at the board.<br> Will someone please read for me<br> what's on the board? Anybody.<br> Juan has five times as many girlfriends<br> as Pedro.<br> Carlos has one girlfriend less than Pedro.<br> If their total number of girlfriends is 20...<br> ...how many does each gigolo have?<br> Late! Late!<br> Late! Late!<br> How many girlfriends does<br> each gigolo have? Anybody.<br> You think you got it, Einstein?<br> Juan is x. Carlos is y. Pedro is x + y.<br> Is Pedro bisexual, or what?<br> I have a terrible feeling about you.<br> You're good now...<br> ...but you'll end up barefoot,<br> pregnant and in the kitchen.<br> Can you get negative girlfriends?<br> No, just negative boyfriends.<br> Please forgive them,<br> for they know not what they do!<br> Carlos has x - 5 girlfriends, qu no?<br> "Que no" is right. Que no.<br> The answer to my prayers!<br> May I go to the restroom?<br> In 10 minutes. Hold it.<br> Hit it.<br> It's a trick problem, Mr. Kimo.<br> You need to know how many girlfriends<br> they have in common.<br> It's not that they're stupid.<br> They just don't know anything.<br> I'm wrong?<br> X = Pedro's girlfriends.<br> X - 1 = Carlos's girlfriends.<br> (x + 5x) + (x -1) = 20.<br> So, x = 3.<br> Good to see you.<br> This makes no sense unless we see<br> how it works in the real world.<br> Could I get a couple of gigolos<br> for a practical demonstration?<br> No, no. Just kidding.<br> What kind of math is this?<br> The one that's up right now is calculus.<br> You'll get it in college.<br> My daughter uses this program<br> in her high school.<br> I want to teach calculus next year.<br> Boy, that's a jump.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> They haven't had trig or math analysis.<br> They can take them this summer.<br> Our best students in summer school?<br> From 7:00 to 12:00.<br> Every day, including Saturdays.<br> That would do it.<br> Summer classrooms are reserved<br> for remedial courses.<br> To turn this school around,<br> start from the top.<br> Mr. Escalante, don't lecture us.<br> Our kids can't handle calculus.<br> We don't even have the books.<br> If they pass the Advanced Placement Test,<br> they get college credit.<br> There are some teachers here...<br> ...who couldn't pass<br> the Advanced Placement Test.<br> You think you can make this fly?<br> I teach calculus or...<br> ...have a good day.<br> If this man can walk in here...<br> ...and dictate his own terms,<br> over my objections...<br> ...I see no reason to continue<br> as department chair.<br> Don't take this personally.<br> I'm thinking about those kids.<br> If they try and don't succeed...<br> ...you'll shatter what little<br> self-confidence they have.<br> These aren't the types that bounce back.<br> Have a good day.<br> Kimo, it stinks like last year in here.<br> Somebody give Claudia an orange.<br> Okay, okay! Sit down!<br> You think I want to do this?<br> The Japanese pay me.<br> They're tired of making everything.<br> They want you to pull your own weight...<br> ...so they can go take vacations<br> on Mount Fuji.<br> Kimo, I thought this room<br> was supposed to be air-conditioned.<br> You should think cool.<br> Think...<br> Cool.<br> Think...<br> Cool.<br> Cool!<br> I get this letter saying<br> I'm fired because of Proposition 13.<br> I'm down to $936.<br> I invest $100 in resumes and buy this suit.<br> I hit every insurance company in the city.<br> My wife wants us to move<br> into her parents' rec room.<br> Two weeks later I get another letter<br> telling me to go back to work.<br> How do you like the suit?<br> - Fabulous.<br> - How about the color?<br> Welcome back, peln!<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah, I'm okay.<br> Sure?<br> Yes! I said I was fine.<br> We will go step by step, inch by inch.<br> Calculus was not made to be easy.<br> It already is.<br> Remember the good times we had<br> last summer?<br> Remember when things were<br> really jumping good?<br> That's Gone With tAhe Wind.<br> Now it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.<br> Come on, a contract?<br> You mean you can't trust us by now?<br> Those of you who commit will be preparing<br> for the AdVanced Placement Test.<br> Have this signed before class tomorrow.<br> We come in an hour early, take your class<br> two periods and stay until 5:00?<br> Believe it or don't.<br> We have to come on Saturdays?<br> And no vacations?<br> Pass the A.P. And you get college credit.<br> - Big deal.<br> - We're seniors. We get to slack off.<br> Can you make it Saturday morning<br> after playing in your band Friday nights?<br> I know you love scaring us into doing stuff.<br> But that gets old real fast.<br> Hey, Kimo.<br> You proud of me? I'm the first dude here!<br> What's calculus?<br> Calculus is math<br> that Sir Isaac Newton invented...<br> ...to figure out planet orbits.<br> But he never told anybody about it...<br> ...until this other scientist<br> claimed he had invented calculus.<br> But the guy was so stupid<br> he got it all wrong...<br> ...so Newton went public<br> to fix his mistakes. Isn't that neat?<br> For a genius, Newton was an idiot.<br> If I invent something,<br> I'll make sure to get paid.<br> I hope this isn't an excuse<br> to stay out all hours.<br> Trust me, Mom. Sign it.<br> Boys don't like it if you're smart.<br> I'm doing this so I don't have to depend<br> on some dumb guy for the rest of my life.<br> Thank you.<br> You don't have it signed,<br> you don't have a ticket to watch the show.<br> Thank you, Mr. Kung Fu.<br> Mr. Blue Eyes, thank you.<br> Elizabeth, my Taylor!<br> Sophia, my Loren.<br> Get a haircut.<br> How many times I got to tell you?<br> Red, get a new jacket.<br> Clint, forget your gun?<br> Unfold it.<br> Hey, you didn't...<br> Get out of the way.<br> - You didn't sign it.<br> - I'm putting school on hold.<br> Go back until you sign it.<br> My uncle offered me a job<br> operating a forklift weekends.<br> So what?<br> Two years in the union<br> and I'll make more than you.<br> The money I'll be making<br> will buy me a new Trans Am.<br> Wouldn't you rather be designing<br> these than repairing them?<br> You can't even do that.<br> They got fuel injection.<br> - You're going to strip my gears.<br> - What's the problem?<br> Don't panic, Johnny.<br> Just watch out for the other guy.<br> - Right or left?<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Right or left!<br> - Go right!<br> All you see is the turn.<br> You don't see the road ahead.<br> Open the gate. We're going to be late.<br> Why are you here so early?<br> We're going to Mr. Escalante's class.<br> Wake up. Drink some coffee.<br> One, you got the graph right here.<br> Two, this is the most important part.<br> Right here.<br> The radius of rotation.<br> That's it. Anybody got any questions?<br> Anybody can do it<br> if you remember one basic element:<br> The element of surprise.<br> Stay awake! Wake up!<br> Wake up! Bring toothpicks<br> to pinch open your eyes.<br> Do you understand, Johnny?<br> I was swimming with dolphins,<br> whispering imaginary numbers...<br> ...looking for the fourth dimension.<br> Go back to sleep. That's very good.<br> Any questions?<br> Yes? No? Nothing? Okay.<br> You should have it by now.<br> What's the answer? Anybody?<br> We're going backwards.<br> You're fooling around too much<br> on the weekend.<br> This girl's got to do some work<br> from the neck up.<br> We'll have to stay late again.<br> We can have pizza delivered.<br> We can get fried chicken, cheeseburgers.<br> Donations? You owe me money.<br> You don't deserve the grades you get.<br> Are you late for another date?<br> She has more boyfriends<br> than Elizabeth Taylor!<br> I don't appreciate you using<br> my personal life to entertain this class.<br> Everything is falling apart.<br> My boyfriend is freaking out!<br> School sucks.<br> I'm in that classroom all day, Kimo.<br> Look at my clothes and my hair.<br> I can't even comb it. I hate my life.<br> So what's the problem?<br> You're going to have to bring him in.<br> I'm not a doctor, Ma'am.<br> There's no way. I don't do diagnosis.<br> Are we going to see the doctor<br> before next week?<br> Hold on. Seguro?<br> Medi-Cal?<br> How are you going to pay for this?<br> If we could pay for it,<br> we'd go to a regular hospital.<br> My grandmother will<br> get pneumonia waiting.<br> Take a seat and we'll call your number.<br> You have to bring him in.<br> There's no way around it.<br> I understand that,<br> but you have to bring him in.<br> Try the shortcut.<br> This is easy. Baby stuff for Boy Scouts.<br> My mind don't work this way.<br> Tic-tac-toe. It's a piece of cake,<br> upside down. Watch for the green light.<br> I've been with you guys for two years!<br> Everyone knows I'm the dumbest!<br> I can't handle calculus!<br> They have a better chance<br> on the A.P. Test without me.<br> Don't laugh!<br> Laugh! You're breaking our hearts.<br> Don't do this.<br> He'll sacrifice himself to benefit the team.<br> Do you have the ganas!<br> I have the ganas.<br> - You want me to do it for you?<br> - Yes!<br> You're supposed to say no!<br> I'm going to have to get tough.<br> We'll have to work<br> right through Christmas break.<br> The counselor was just here<br> looking for you.<br> Something about cosmetology classes.<br> He says, there's three different levels.<br> One for boys, one for girls and one<br> for I don't know what. Go find out.<br> Kimo, listen. It's cool.<br> - My grandmother...<br> - Clock out.<br> Game's over. You lose.<br> You never listen to nobody, man!<br> Adis. Why don't you...<br> ...send me some postcards?<br> Or call me on the phone, let me know...<br> ...how you're doing? We love you.<br> Kimo Sabe this, cabrn!<br> Pancho, that guy has a bigger problem<br> than you.<br> Tic-tac-toe.<br> Simple.<br> No. She's a little sloppy<br> with her homework.<br> Dad, get off the phone so we can eat.<br> No, she's a top student.<br> You're father works 60 hours a week,<br> then volunteers to teach night school.<br> Merry Christmas to you, too.<br> Now he's visiting junior high schools<br> in his spare time.<br> Corn and potatoes?<br> What happened to the lomo montado<br> pica a lo macho?<br> Jaime, I don't want you to teach<br> this holiday.<br> No teaching.<br> I don't understand this problem.<br> His own son has problems with math.<br> Give me that book.<br> - No books at the table.<br> - Go wash your hands.<br> I'll get it.<br> You see what I mean?<br> I've seen you do a lot<br> of underhanded tricks...<br> ...but bringing your abuelita<br> to my house at Christmastime, come on.<br> I need calculus to take me<br> to a good career, Johnny.<br> Something smells good.<br> "On the first day of Christmas<br> A cholo came to me"<br> This is what's given.<br> We're looking for the area<br> in the first quadrant bounded by the curve.<br> What are the limits? Anybody.<br> Wrong. Lupe.<br> What is wrong with you? This is review.<br> I checked my work twice.<br> Check it again.<br> I got the same answer as the gordita.<br> Don't call me gordita, pendejo.<br> It's 0 to pi/2, sir.<br> Yeah, I got the same thing.<br> You should know this!<br> What is wrong with you? This is review!<br> You act like a blind man in a dark room...<br> ...looking for a black cat that isn't there!<br> I don't believe it. It's giving me a shot<br> from the back! No way!<br> Kimo finally blew a head gasket.<br> It's a pen.<br> It's a pencil.<br> It's a chair.<br> It's a light.<br> It's a window.<br> It's in the room, on the table.<br> It's 10:00.<br> Un momento, por favor.<br> One moment, please.<br> Page 456, please.<br> Come on, Page 456.<br> Shut up and sit down.<br> We told him to take it easy.<br> It's our fault.<br> We sit back and watch him burn in.<br> It's "burn out."<br> The man brought it on himself.<br> He was asking for trouble.<br> How can you say that?<br> You wanna-be cholo asshole.<br> That's disgusting!<br> You want me? I'll kick your ass!<br> It's Molina!<br> Break it up! Pancho, just break it up.<br> Settle down.<br> - Later, dude.<br> - Settle down, Angel.<br> Mr. Escalante is okay.<br> He had a mild heart attack<br> and he's under observation.<br> Mr. Schloss is your substitute.<br> Out of respect to Mr. Escalante,<br> please give him your undivided attention.<br> I don't want any more trouble<br> from this room.<br> Pancho, you come with me.<br> Angel, let's go.<br> Tito, take your seat.<br> Mr. Molina has informed me that...<br> ...you have your A.P. Calculus exam<br> in two weeks.<br> To be honest, I've never taught calculus.<br> I'm really a music teacher.<br> Are you mad at me, Mommy?<br> If I thought it would help, I would be angry.<br> The doctor says no stress.<br> No job-related activity for at least a month.<br> I want another doctor.<br> I have to go.<br> I left Fernando with a neighbor.<br> - I'll stay with Dad.<br> - No, go with your mother.<br> Don't forget to take out the trash.<br> What time do you get off work?<br> I'm still alive! I'm a hard-dying guy.<br> Shouldn't you be in the hospital?<br> No, I should be here with you.<br> Bulldogs!<br> Dog, dog, dog, dog.<br> Thank you for baby-sitting my canguros.<br> Have a good day.<br> How are you?<br> You should take it easy.<br> Go back to bed, man.<br> No, I should be here with you.<br> You already forgot to stand up!<br> Everybody!<br> No, against the wall like a snake! Hurry!<br> We've practiced for this all year.<br> You're the best!<br> You guys are the best!<br> This will be a piece of cake!<br> Upside down.<br> And...<br> Step by step.<br> You got it now. Open your eyes.<br> Y = In...<br> ...(x - 1). What is the domain?<br> X - 1.<br> No! End of the line!<br> I'm gone two days and you forget.<br> What's the domain?<br> All real numbers greater than one. X 1.<br> I told you, you could do it. Okay!<br> Be sure each mark is black<br> and completely filled-in.<br> If you make an error...<br> ...save time by crossing it out<br> instead of erasing.<br> It is not expected that you will<br> answer all multiple choice questions.<br> When you're told to begin,<br> open your booklet.<br> Tear out the green insert and start work.<br> You may begin.<br> Let's go!<br> I like to keep my pants dry.<br> The water is great! Come on!<br> Okay, fine!<br> This is so stupid!<br> I'm coming!<br> Orale, Grandpa!<br> We, being teachers...<br> ...know the Advanced Placement Tests<br> are very difficult...<br> ...especially in mathematics.<br> Less than two percent<br> of all high school seniors nationwide...<br> ...even attempt<br> the Advanced Placement Calculus Test.<br> You've been drinking!<br> I am proud to announce...<br> ...that no other high school<br> in Southern California...<br> ...has more students passing...<br> ...than Garfield High School.<br> No, he just walks like that.<br> Eighteen students took the test.<br> Eighteen passed.<br> We have an announcement to make.<br> We, the A.P. Calculus Class...<br> ...would like to present this plaque<br> to our teacher...<br> ...Jaime A. Escalante.<br> Yes, this is Guadalupe Escobar.<br> Is this some kind of joke?<br> Who is this?<br> For real?<br> What?<br> You're crazy, man.<br> "Tests are graded with the identity<br> of the student concealed.<br> "Only after irregularities were found<br> was it determined...<br> "...that all the students were<br> from Garfield High." You all got this?<br> "Based upon the unusual agreement<br> of incorrect answers...<br> "...E.T.S. Must question the scores...<br> "...of all students with<br> such unusual agreement."<br> What does it mean in English?<br> They think we cheated because<br> we all had the same wrong answers.<br> We're too stupid<br> to know how to cheat correctly.<br> Let's sue them.<br> "The board doubts the grades are valid<br> because of these unusual circumstances."<br> These people are human.<br> They can make mistakes.<br> Kimo, these people are calling us cheaters.<br> This is where we keep<br> all confidential material...<br> ...S.A.T. And A.P. Tests included.<br> Only my secretary and I know<br> the combination.<br> This controversy is officially<br> between the E.T.S. And the students.<br> It does not reflect upon your school<br> or its administration.<br> We'd like to resolve this<br> with as little publicity as possible.<br> I'd appreciate that.<br> You think they got the test ahead of time?<br> Claudia was having emotional problems.<br> Pancho was way behind.<br> Do you really think anyone cheated?<br> No.<br> But my father does.<br> Damn shit!<br> Look at this shit!<br> If I'd taken that job with my uncle,<br> I'd have a new car by now!<br> It's all right. You can fix it.<br> You can fix it. Just relax.<br> I didn't know you two were a thing now.<br> Just something for the summer.<br> You're an asshole, Pancho.<br> Shit!<br> Lots of stars up there, homey.<br> Not too polluted.<br> The stars aren't really there, ese.<br> What you're looking at<br> is where they used to be.<br> It takes the light...<br> ...1,000 years to reach the earth.<br> For all we know,<br> they burned out a long time ago.<br> God pulled the plug on us.<br> He didn't tell nobody.<br> The stars are out there, homeboy.<br> I don't care what you say.<br> Hey, homeboy!<br> Throw me a kiss, baby!<br> That's right! That's all you know.<br> Can't you afford a knife?<br> Use a pencil, go to jail.<br> You've got a tough mouth.<br> You better watch yourself.<br> Mucho gusto, officer.<br> That was real smart, ese!<br> Get away from my ride!<br> Get up!<br> Get up!<br> Where are you going?<br> Come back!<br> Well, does anyone have anything to say?<br> I've known your family for years.<br> Tell us the truth.<br> Nothing happened.<br> - Don't lie to me.<br> - Nothing happened!<br> Leave her alone.<br> She didn't do anything wrong.<br> Then tell us who did.<br> We're not cops.<br> We're not here to put anybody behind bars.<br> If you cheated,<br> let us know so you can go home...<br> ...and enjoy the rest of your summer.<br> I come from this neighborhood.<br> I know that sometimes we're tempted<br> to take shortcuts.<br> Tell me the truth. What happened?<br> We're busted. Let's admit it.<br> How did you do it?<br> I got the test ahead of time<br> and passed it out.<br> How did you get it?<br> The mailman.<br> I strangled him.<br> His body's decomposing in my locker.<br> No sense in continuing<br> if they won't cooperate.<br> Do you know how this got in my box?<br> A letter of resignation.<br> Anonymous.<br> My guess is that it has something to do<br> with the mess this school is in.<br> Do you think the students cheated?<br> Mr. Escalante, you put these kids<br> under an awful lot of pressure.<br> They would have gone to any lengths<br> to please you.<br> You didn't answer my question.<br> Every night I watch the news on Tv.<br> I see a lot of people go on trial.<br> They deny everything or their lawyers say<br> they were insane when they did it.<br> A lot of them get off.<br> But I believe most people<br> who get caught today are guilty...<br> ...don't you?<br> Yep, I know what you mean.<br> Have you seen my car?<br> Do you need a ride home?<br> No, thank you!<br> Kimo, let me take you home!<br> Want to talk about it?<br> I may have made a mistake trying<br> to teach them calculus.<br> Regardless of whether they passed<br> that test or not...<br> ...they learned.<br> They learned if you try real hard,<br> nothing changes.<br> Quit.<br> If that's all you have left to teach...<br> ...quit.<br> What kills me...<br> ...is that they lost the confidence...<br> ...in the system they are now<br> finally qualified to be a part of.<br> I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.<br> I don't need it.<br> I could make twice the money<br> and less hours...<br> ...and have people treat me with respect.<br> Respect?<br> Jaime, those kids love you.<br> Hey, Kimo!<br> Check out your ride!<br> We fixed it up for you.<br> It's going downtown<br> to take action on those E.T.S. Boys.<br> Dad, check out your new car!<br> We got to talk about the payments,<br> though.<br> I'm Jaime Escalante. I'm the A.P.<br> Calculus teacher from Garfield High.<br> I'm Dr. Pearson...<br> ...and this is Dr. Ramirez.<br> I feel I have a right to know<br> why you think my students cheated.<br> I'm sorry you drove all the way out here...<br> ...but we're not at liberty<br> to discuss the controversy.<br> I'd just like to see the test, that's all.<br> I understand what you're going through...<br> ...but the problem is between the E.T.S.<br> And the students.<br> I'd just like to see<br> what kind of mistakes were made.<br> I'm their teacher. I know my kids.<br> Mr. Escalante, have a seat.<br> No, thank you.<br> There were some...<br> ...unorthodox, even illogical, computations<br> for students of this caliber.<br> Mistakes in simple math.<br> Because they have the same teacher<br> teaching them the same program.<br> I taught them step by step,<br> all the same way.<br> Your students averaged fewer than<br> four wrong on the multiple choice...<br> ...where other schools average<br> Most of your kids finished<br> with time to spare.<br> They should be rewarded, not punished.<br> The Educational Testing Service...<br> ...does not act capriciously.<br> Every major university in the US<br> subscribes to our service.<br> I'd just like to see proof of wrongdoing.<br> I'd like to see the tests.<br> There is no proof of wrongdoing,<br> only a suspicion of cheating.<br> In this country...<br> ...one is innocent until proven guilty.<br> Not vice versa.<br> If you are so confident of their abilities,<br> encourage them to retest.<br> Why?<br> If they don't,<br> everyone will assume they cheated.<br> Everyone will assume<br> they cheated if they do.<br> I want to see the test!<br> Mr. Escalante, we are psychometricians,<br> thorough to the point of boring.<br> We're not out to get anyone.<br> Wait.<br> A situation of two students<br> cheating is one thing.<br> This blanket accusation is saying<br> there was a conspiracy.<br> Every conspiracy has a leader.<br> Who better qualify to be the leader<br> than the teacher?<br> Nobody is accusing you here of anything.<br> Not only me, the school, the parents,<br> the entire community!<br> Scores this high would be questioned<br> regardless of the school.<br> But if this was Beverly Hills High<br> they wouldn't have sent you to investigate.<br> I hope you're not insinuating<br> that we haven't earned our position here.<br> No one has given me a damn thing.<br> You are letting your emotions<br> get the best of you.<br> If no one gave you a damn thing,<br> you shouldn't take away from my kids!<br> The identity of the students<br> was concealed...<br> ...until it was determined<br> that irregularities existed.<br> No one would have questioned the scores<br> if my kids didn't have Spanish surnames...<br> ...and come from barrio schools!<br> All right. We've explained our position<br> and heard your complaints, but now...<br> ...our conversation is over.<br> Something is going on<br> that nobody is talking about.<br> And you know what it is!<br> No one has the right to accuse me<br> of racism. No one has that right!<br> I know well how to spell discrimination!<br> I thought this was over long ago.<br> Why do this to my kids?<br> There are two kinds of racism,<br> Mr. Escalante.<br> Singling out a group<br> who are members of a minority...<br> ...and not singling out a group<br> who are members of a minority.<br> My kids could teach you<br> a thing or two, Johnny!<br> I'll call security<br> if you can't control yourself.<br> Do it!<br> You didn't prove anything.<br> My kids didn't do anything!<br> I'll prove you guys wrong.<br> I hope you do<br> because this is not between you and me.<br> Maybe not.<br> But if I catch you on the street,<br> I'll kick the shit out of you.<br> This is Guadalupe Escobar.<br> I'm going to take the test again.<br> You're kidding!<br> Kimo, we only have one day to study.<br> You didn't let me talk to them.<br> Call collect. Stick them with a big bill.<br> Thought I'd seen this place<br> for the last time.<br> We'll have to review the whole course<br> in one shot.<br> - In one day?<br> - Can't do it in any less.<br> Maybe they'll give us the same test.<br> It will be harder. You can count on that.<br> Just go step by step and play defense.<br> Don't bring anything.<br> No pencils, no erasers, nothing.<br> Don't wear clothes with too many pockets.<br> Don't let your eyes wander.<br> No spacing out.<br> Don't give them any opportunity<br> to call you cheaters.<br> You are the true dreamers.<br> And dreams accomplish wonderful things.<br> You're the best.<br> Tomorrow you'll prove<br> that you're the champs.<br> Start with Chapter 1.<br> Kimo, what you making there?<br> You like brains? Good. I was afraid<br> you guys wouldn't appreciate it.<br> This food lasts for 24-hours.<br> You're afraid we're going<br> to screw up royally tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow is just another day.<br> I'm afraid you'll screw up<br> the rest of your lives.<br> I'm fried. I don't care<br> if I don't pass that test.<br> - Sit down. We got a lot of work to do.<br> - I'm going home.<br> Sit down.<br> I'm tired and I'm going home. Okay?<br> - Do you know what you're doing?<br> - I'm going home, that's what.<br> It's almost ready. Who wants some?<br> Let's order out, man.<br> Just kidding.<br> I had to see you.<br> You can't expect me to be your girlfriend<br> at your convenience.<br> I'm an asshole.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm sure you're all familiar<br> with the procedure.<br> You have 90 minutes to complete<br> the multiple choice section.<br> Do not fill in answers by guessing.<br> Wrong answers will be counted<br> against you.<br> You may begin Part 1, now.<br> Okay, pencils down.<br> You have 90 minutes to complete<br> the free-response section.<br> Do not spend too much time<br> on any particular answer.<br> Credit will be issued for partial solutions.<br> Open the booklet, begin Part 2. Good luck.<br> - Finished?<br> - No, I can't finish the test.<br> I have a scholarship appointment at U.S.C.<br> - Can't that wait?<br> - No, it can't.<br> Did you fill out your ID card?<br> Okay, pencils down.<br> Did you hear the news?<br> We got the computers.<br> Yep, that'll do it.<br> They want to go over the test again<br> so that there's no misunderstandings.<br> I'm on my way to the faculty meeting.<br> Misunderstanding again?<br> Call Dr. Ramirez. He'll help us.<br> He'll tell me the same thing.<br> All right, I'll call him.<br> This is Mr. Molina calling again.<br> Can I speak to...<br> Yes, I did.<br> You do?<br> Yes! I'd like that very much.<br> One moment.<br> Yes, I'm aware of the scoring.<br> Three is a passing grade,<br> five is a perfect grade.<br> I'm ready.
