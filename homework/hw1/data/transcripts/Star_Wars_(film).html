                        Did you hear that?<br> They've shut down the main reactor.<br> We'll be destroyed for sure.<br> This is madness!<br> We're doomed!<br> There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.<br> What's that?<br> R2-D2, where are you?<br> At last! Where have you been?<br> They're heading in this direction.<br> What are we going to do?<br> We'll be sent to the spice mines of<br> Kessel or smashed into who knows what!<br> Wait a minute. Where are you going?<br> The Death Star plans are<br> not in the main computer.<br> Where are those transmissions you intercepted?<br> What have you done with those plans?<br> We intercepted no transmissions.<br> Aaah....This is a consular ship.<br> Were on a diplomatic mission.<br> If this is a consular ship...<br> were is the Ambassador?<br> Commander, tear this ship apart<br> until you've found those plans<br> and bring me the Ambassador.<br> I want her alive!<br> There she is! Set for stun!<br> She'll be all right.<br> Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.<br> Hey, you're not permitted in there.<br> It's restricted.<br> You'll be deactivated for sure.<br> Don't call me a mindless philosopher,<br> you overweight glob of grease!<br> Now come out before somebody sees you.<br> Secret mission? What plans?<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm not getting in there!<br> I'm going to regret this.<br> -There goes another one.<br> -Hold your fire. There are no life forms.<br> It must have been short-circuited.<br> That's funny, the damage doesn't<br> look as bad from out here.<br> Are you sure this things safe?<br> Lord Vader, I should have known.<br> Only you could be so bold.<br> The Imperial Senate will not sit for this,<br> when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...<br> Don't play games with me, Your Highness.<br> You weren't on any mercy mission this time.<br> Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.<br> I want to know what happened<br> to the plans they sent you.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on<br> a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...<br> You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor.<br> Take her away!<br> Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out,<br> it could generate sympathy for<br> the Rebellion in the senate.<br> I have traced the Rebel spies to her.<br> Now she is my only link<br> to find their secret base!<br> -She'll die before she tells you anything.<br> -Leave that to me.<br> Send a distress signal and then inform the<br> senate that all aboard were killed!<br> ord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard<br> this ship! And no transmissions were made.<br> An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting,<br> but no life forms were aboard.<br> She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.<br> Send a detachment down to retrieve them.<br> See to it personally, Commander.<br> There'll be no one to stop us this time.<br> How did I get into this mess?<br> I really don't know how.<br> We seem to be made to suffer.<br> It's our lot in life.<br> I've got to rest before I fall apart.<br> My joints are almost frozen.<br> What a desolate place this is.<br> Where are you going?<br> Well, I'm not going that way.<br> It's much too rocky.<br> This way is much easier.<br> What makes you think<br> there are settlements over there?<br> Don't get technical with me.<br> What mission? What are you talking about?<br> I've had just about enough of you!<br> Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day,<br> you nearsighted scrap pile!<br> And don't let me catch you following me<br> begging for help, because you won't get it.<br> No more adventures.<br> I'm not going that way.<br> That malfunctioning little twerp.<br> This is all his fault!<br> He tricked me into going this way,<br> but he'll do no better.<br> Wait, what's that?<br> A transport! I'm saved!<br> Over here!<br> Help! Please, help!<br> Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!<br> Someone was in the pod.<br> The tracks go off in this direction.<br> Look, sir -- droids.<br> Wake up! Wake up!<br> We're doomed.<br> Do you think they'll melt us down?<br> Don't shoot! Don't shoot!<br> Will this never end?<br> Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator<br> to be sure it speaks Bocce.<br> It looks like we don't have much of a choice<br> but I'll remind him.<br> No, not that.<br> I suppose you are programmed for protocol.<br> Protocol. It's my primary function set...<br> -I have no need for a protocol droid.<br> -Of course you haven't.<br> Not in an environment such as this.<br> What I really need is a droid that understands<br> the binary language of moisture vaporators.<br> Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming<br> binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators.<br> -Do you speak Bocce?<br> -Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language<br> for me...I'm as fluent in Bocce...<br> All right shut up!<br> I'll take this one.<br> Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?<br> I want you to have both of them<br> cleaned up before dinner.<br> But I was going into Toshi Station<br> to pick up some power converters...<br> You can waste time with your friends when your<br> chores are done.<br> Now come on, get to it!<br> All right, come on!<br> And the red one, come on.<br> Well, come on,<br> Red, let's go.<br> Uncle Owen...<br> This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!<br> Hey, what're you trying to push on us?<br> Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in<br> prime condition. A real bargain.<br> Uncle Owen!<br> What about that one?<br> What about that one?<br> We'll take that one.<br> I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.<br> He really is in first-class condition.<br> I've worked with him before.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck<br> out for you is quite beyond my capacity!<br> Thank the maker!<br> This oil bath is going to feel so good.<br> I've got such a bad case of dust contamination,<br> I can barely move!<br> It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right.<br> I'm never gonna get out of here!<br> Is there anything I might do to help?<br> Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the<br> harvest, or teleport me off this rock!<br> I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very<br> knowledgeable about such things.<br> Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact,<br> I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.<br> Well, if there's a bright center to the universe,<br> you're on the planet that it's farthest from.<br> -I see, sir.<br> -Uh, you can call me Luke.<br> I see, sir Luke.<br> Just Luke.<br> And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations,<br> and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.<br> You got a lot of carbon scoring here.<br> It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.<br> With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed<br> we're in as good condition as we are,<br> what with the Rebellion and all.<br> -You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?<br> -That's how we came to be in your service,<br> if you take my meaning, sir.<br> -Have you been in many battles?<br> -Several, I think.<br> Actually, there's not much to tell.<br> I'm not much more than an interpreter,<br> and not very good at telling stories.<br> Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.<br> Well, my little friend, you've got<br> something jammed in here realgood.<br> Were you on a cruiser or...<br> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.<br> What's this?<br> What is what?!? He asked you a question...<br> What is that?<br> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.<br> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.<br> Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction.<br> Old data. Pay it no mind.<br> Who is she?<br> She's beautiful.<br> -I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.<br> -Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...<br> I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.<br> A person of some importance, sir -- I believe.<br> Our captain was attached to...<br> Is there more to this recording?<br> Behave yourself, Artoo.<br> You're going to get us in trouble.<br> It's all right, you can trust him.<br> He's our new master.<br> ...You're my only hope.<br> He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi,<br> a resident of these parts.<br> And it's a private message for him.<br> Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about.<br> Our last master was Captain Antilles,<br> but with what we've been through,<br> this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.<br> Obi-Wan Kenobi?<br> I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?<br> I beg your pardon, sir,<br> but do you know what he's talking about?<br> Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,<br> but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.<br> He's kind of a strange old hermit.<br> I wonder who she is.<br> It sounds like she's in trouble.<br> I'd better play back the whole thing.<br> He says the restraining bolt has short<br> circuited his recording system.<br> He suggests that if you remove the bolt,<br> he might be able to play back the entire recording.<br> I guess you're too small to run away<br> on me if I take this off! Okay.<br> Where'd she go?<br> Bring her back! Play back the entire message.<br> What message?<br> The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!<br> All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.<br> I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to<br> have picked up a slight flutter.<br> Well, see what you can do with him.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Just you reconsider playing that message for him.<br> No, I don't think he likes you at all.<br> No, I don't like you either.<br> -You know, I think that R2 unit we<br> bought might have been stolen.<br> -What makes you think that?<br> Well, I stumbled across a<br> recording while I was cleaning him.<br> He says he belongs to someone<br> called Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br> I thought he might have meant old Ben.<br> Do you know what he's talking about?<br> -Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.<br> -That old man's just a crazy old man.<br> Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into<br> Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.<br> That'llbe the end of it. It belongs to us now.<br> But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?<br> He won't,<br> I don't think he exists any more.<br> He died about the same time as your father.<br> -He knew my father?<br> -I told you to forget it.<br> Your only concern is to prepare the new<br> droids for tomorrow.<br> In the morning I want them on the south ridge<br> working out those condensers.<br> I think those new droids are going to work out fine.<br> I was also thinking about our agreement about<br> my staying on another season.<br> And if these new droids do work out, I want to<br> transmit my application to the Academy this year.<br> -You mean the next semester before harvest?<br> -Sure, there're more than enough droids.<br> Harvest is when I need you the most.<br> Only one more season.<br> This year we'll make enough on the harvest<br> so I'll be able to hire some more hands.<br> And then you can go to the Academy next year.<br> -You must understand I need you here, Luke.<br> -But it's a whole 'nother year.<br> -Look, it's only one more season.<br> -Yeah, that's what you said<br> when Biggs and Tank left.<br> -Where are you going?<br> -It looks like I'm going nowhere.<br> I have to finish cleaning those droids.<br> Owen, he can't stay here forever.<br> Most of his friends have gone.<br> -It means so much to him.<br> I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.<br> Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.<br> He has too much of his father in him.<br> That's what I'm afraid of.<br> What are you doing hiding there?<br> It wasn't my fault, sir.<br> Please don't deactivate me.<br> I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning<br> That R2 unit has always been a problem.<br> These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.<br> Even I can't understand their logic at times.<br> How could I be so stupid?<br> He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!<br> Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?<br> It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.<br> We'll have to wait until morning.<br> -Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.<br> -All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.<br> Boy, am I gonna get it.<br> -You know that little droid is going<br> to cause me a lot of trouble.<br> -Oh, he excels at that, sir.<br> Have you seen Luke this morning?<br> He said he had some things to do<br> before he started today, so he left early.<br> -Did he take those two new droids with him?<br> -I think so.<br> Well, he'd better have those units in the south range<br> repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!<br> There's something dead ahead on the scanner.<br> It looks like our R2-Unit...hit the accelerator.<br> Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?<br> Master Luke here is your rightful owner.<br> We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...<br> And don't talk to me about your mission, either.<br> You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a<br> million pieces right here.<br> No, it's alright.<br> What's wrong with him now?<br> He says there are several creatures<br> approaching from the southeast.<br> Sandpeople! Or worst!<br> Come on, let's have a look. Come on.<br> There are two Banthas down there but<br> I don't see any...wait a second,<br> they're Sandpeople all right.<br> I can see one of them now.<br> Hello there!<br> Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.<br> Don't worry, he'll be all right.<br> Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.<br> You're fortunate you're still in one piece.<br> Ben? Ben Kenobi!<br> Boy, am I glad to see you!<br> The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.<br> Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?<br> Oh, this little droid!<br> I think he's searching for his former master...<br> I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...<br> He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br> Is he a relative of yours?<br> Do you know who he's talking about?<br> Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...<br> a long time.<br> I think my uncle knew him.<br> He said he was dead.<br> Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet.<br> -Do you know him?<br> -Well of course, of course I know him. He's me!<br> I haven't gone bythe name Obi-Wan since oh,<br> before you were born.<br> Then the droid does belong to you.<br> Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.<br> Very interesting...<br> I think we better get indoors.<br> The Sandpeople are easily startled<br> but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.<br> Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...<br> Can you stand? We've got to get out of<br> here before the Sandpeople return.<br> I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.<br> There's no sense in you risking yourself on my<br> account. I'm done for.<br> -No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?<br> -Quickly, son...they're on the move.<br> No, my father didn't fight in the wars.<br> He was a navigator on a spice freighter.<br> That's what your uncle told you.<br> Thought he should have stayed here and<br> not gotten involved.<br> You fought in the Clone Wars?<br> Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.<br> -I wish I'd known him.<br> -He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy,<br> and a cunning warrior.<br> I understand you've become quite<br> a good pilot yourself.<br> And he was a good friend.<br> Which reminds me...<br> I have something here for you.<br> Your father wanted you to have<br> this when you were old enough,<br> but your uncle wouldn't allow it.<br> He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan<br> on some damned-fool idealistic<br> crusade like your father did.<br> -Sir, if you'll not be needing me,<br> I'll close down for awhile.<br> -Sure, go ahead.<br> What is it?<br> Your fathers lightsaber.<br> his is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.<br> Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.<br> An elegant weapon<br> for a more civilized age.<br> For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights<br> were the guardians of peace and<br> justicein the Old Republic.<br> Before the dark times, before the Empire.<br> How did my father die?<br> A young Jedi named Darth Vader,<br> who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil,<br> helped the Empire hunt down and<br> destroy the Jedi Knights.<br> He betrayed and murdered your father.<br> Now the Jedi are all but extinct.<br> Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.<br> The Force?<br> Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power.<br> It's an energy<br> field created by all living things.<br> It surrounds us and penetrates us.<br> It binds the galaxy together.<br> Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are,<br> my little friend.<br> And where you come from.<br> -I saw part of the message he was...<br> -I seem to have found it.<br> General Kenobi, years ago you served my<br> father in the Clone Wars.<br> Now he begs you to help him in his<br> struggle against the Empire.<br> I regret that I am unable to present my father's<br> request to you in person,<br> but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid<br> my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.<br> I have placed information vital to the survival of the<br> Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2-unit.<br> My father will know how to retrieve it.<br> You must see this droid safely delivered<br> to him on Alderaan.<br> This is our most desperate hour.<br> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.<br> You must learn the ways of the Force<br> if you're to come with me to Alderaan.<br> Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.<br> I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.<br> I need your help, Luke. She needs your help.<br> I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.<br> I can't get involved! I've got work to do!<br> It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it!<br> But there's nothing I can do about it right now.<br> -It's such a long way from here.<br> -That's your uncle talking.<br> Oh, God, my uncle.<br> How am I ever going to explain this?<br> Learn about the Force, Luke.<br> Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.<br> You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley<br> or wherever you're going.<br> You must do what you feel is right, of course.<br> Until this battle station is fully operational<br> we are vulnerable.<br> The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.<br> They're more dangerous than you realize.<br> Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander,<br> not to this battle station!<br> The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the<br> Imperial Senate as long as....<br> The Imperial Senate will no longer be<br> of any concern to us.<br> I've just received word that the Emperor has<br> dissolved the council permanently.<br> The last remnants of the Old Republic<br> have been swept away.<br> That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain<br> control without the bureaucracy?<br> The regional governors now have direct control<br> over their territories.<br> Fear will keep the local systems in line.<br> -Fear of this battle station.<br> -And what of the Rebellion?<br> If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical<br> readout of this station, it is possible,<br> however unlikely, that they might find a weakness<br> and exploit it.<br> The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.<br> Any attack made by the Rebels against this station<br> would be a useless gesture,<br> no matter what technical data they've obtained.<br> This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.<br> I suggest we use it!<br> Don't be too proud of this technological<br> terror you've constructed.<br> The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next<br> to the power of the Force.<br> Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's<br> ways, Lord Vader.<br> Your sad devotion to that ancient religion<br> has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes,<br> or given you clairvoyance enough to find the<br> Rebel's hidden fort...<br> I find your lack of faith disturbing.<br> Enough of this! Vader, release him!<br> As you wish.<br> This bickering is pointless.<br> Lord Vader will provide us with<br> the location of the Rebel fortress<br> by the time this station is operational.<br> We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.<br> It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here<br> are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.<br> They didn't. But we are meant to think they did.<br> These tracks are<br> side by side.<br> Sandpeople always ride single file to hide<br> their numbers.<br> These are the same Jawas that sold us<br> Artoo and Threepio.<br> And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.<br> Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.<br> Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?<br> If they traced the robots here, they may have learned<br> who they sold them to.<br> And that would lead them...<br> -home!<br> -Wait, Luke!<br> It's too dangerous.<br> Uncle Owen!<br> Aunt Beru!<br> And, now Your Highness,<br> we will discuss the location of your<br> hidden Rebel base.<br> There's nothing you could have done, Luke,<br> had you been there.<br> You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would<br> be in the hands of the Empire.<br> I want to come with you to Alderaan.<br> There's nothing here for me now.<br> I want to learn the ways of the Force and<br> become a Jedi like my father.<br> Mos Eisley Spaceport.<br> You will never find a more wretched hive of<br> scum and villainy.<br> We must be cautious.<br> -How long have you had these droids?<br> -About three or four seasons.<br> They're for sale if you want them.<br> -Let me see your identification.<br> -You don't need to see his identification.<br> We don't need to see his identification.<br> These are not the droids your looking for.<br> These are not the droids we're looking for.<br> He can go about his business.<br> -You can go about your business.<br> -Move along.<br> Move along. Move along.<br> I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.<br> I can't understand how we got by those troopers.<br> I thought we were dead.<br> The Force can have a strong influence<br> on the weak-minded.<br> Do you really think we're going to find a pilot<br> here that'll take us to Alderaan?<br> Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found<br> here. Only watch your step.<br> This place can be a little rough.<br> I'm ready for anything.<br> Come along, Artoo.<br> -We don't serve their kind here!<br> -What?<br> -Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.<br> Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.<br> We don't want any trouble.<br> I heartily agree with you sir.<br> -He doesn't like you.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> I don't like you either<br> on't insult us. You just watch yourself.<br> We're wanted men.<br> I have the death sentence in twelve systems.<br> -I'll be careful than.<br> -You'll be dead.<br> This little one isn't worth the effort.<br> Come let me buy you something...<br> I'm alright.<br> Chewbacca here is first-mate on a ship<br> that might suit our needs.<br> I don't like the look of this.<br> Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.<br> Chewie here tells me you're looking for<br> passage to the Alderaan system.<br> Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.<br> Fast ship? You've never heard of the<br> Millennium Falcon?<br> -Should I have?<br> -It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than<br> twelve parsecs!<br> I've outrun Imperial starships,<br> not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.<br> I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.<br> She's fast enough for you, old man.<br> -What's the cargo?<br> -Only passengers.<br> Myself, the boy, two droids,<br> and no questions asked.<br> What is it? Some kind of local trouble?<br> Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial<br> entanglements.<br> Well, that's the trick, isn't it?<br> And it's going to cost you something extra.<br> Ten thousand, all in advance.<br> Ten thousand?<br> We could almost buy our own ship for that!<br> But who's going to fly it, kid! You?<br> You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself!<br> We don't have to sit here and listen...<br> We can pay you two thousand now,<br> plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.<br> Seventeen, huh!<br> Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.<br> -We'll leave as soon as you're ready.<br> Docking bay Ninety-four.<br> -Ninety-four.<br> Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest<br> in your handiwork.<br> All right, we'll check it out.<br> Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be<br> desperate.<br> This could really save my neck.<br> Get back to the ship and get her ready.<br> -You'll have to sell your speeder.<br> -That's okay. I'm never coming back to this<br> planet again.<br> Going somewhere, Solo?<br> Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to<br> see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.<br> It's too late. You should have paid him when<br> you had the chance.<br> Jabba's put a price on your head,<br> so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy<br> will be looking for you.<br> - I'm lucky I found you first.<br> -Yeah, but this time I got the money.<br> If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.<br> I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...<br> Jabba's through with you.<br> He has no time for smugglers who drop heir<br> shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.<br> Even I get boarded sometimes.<br> Do you think I had a choice?<br> You can tell that to Jabba.<br> He may only take your ship.<br> -Over my dead body.<br> -That's the idea. I've been looking forward to<br> killing you for a long time.<br> Yes, I'll bet you have.<br> Sorry about the mess.<br> Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.<br> It will be some time before we can extract any<br> information from her.<br> The final check-out is complete.<br> All systems are operational.<br> What course shall we set?<br> Perhaps she would respond to an alternative<br> form of persuasion.<br> -What do you mean?<br> -I think it is time we demonstrate the full power<br> of this station.<br> -Set your course for Alderaan.<br> -With pleasure.<br> Lock the door, Artoo.<br> All right, check that side of the street.<br> It's locked. Move on to the next door.<br> I would much rather have gone with Master Luke<br> than stay here with you.<br> I don't know what all the trouble is about,<br> but I'm sure it must be your fault..<br> You watch your language!<br> I'll take it.<br> Since the XP-38 came out,<br> they're just not in demand.<br> It will be enough.<br> Come out of there Solo!<br> Right here, Jabba.<br> -I've been waiting for you.<br> -Have you now?<br> You didn't think I was going to run did you?<br> Han, my boy, there are times when you<br> surprise me.<br> Why haven't you paid me?<br> And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that,<br> after all we're been throught together?<br> Look Jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come<br> and see me yourself.<br> Don't send one of these twerps.<br> Han, Han understand, I just can't afford to make exceptions.<br> You understand I just can't make an exception.<br> Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me<br> dumped their shipment...<br> ...at the first sign of an Imperial starship?<br> It's not good business.<br> Look Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.<br> Do you think I had a choice?<br> I got a nice easy charter now.<br> I'll pay you back...<br> ...plus a little extra. I just need some more time.<br> Han, my boy, you're the best.<br> So for an extra twenty percent<br> Fifteen Jabba, don't push it.<br> Okay, fifteen percent. But if you fail me again,<br> I'll put a price on your head<br> so big you won't be able to go near a civilized system.<br> Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.<br> Let's go.<br> What a piece of junk.<br> She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.<br> She may notlook like much, but she's got it where<br> it counts, kid.<br> I've added some special modifications myself.<br> We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll<br> get out of here.<br> Hello, sir.<br> All right, men. Load your weapons!<br> Stop that ship! Blast 'em!<br> Chewie, get us out of here!<br> Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.<br> It looks like an Imperial cruiser.<br> Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.<br> Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while<br> I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.<br> Stay sharp! There are two more coming in;<br> they're going to try to cut us off.<br> -Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said<br> this thing was fast.<br> -Watch your mouth, kid<br> We'll be safe enough once we make the<br> jump to hyperspace.<br> Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!<br> -Here's where the fun begins!<br> -How long before you can make the jump<br> to light speed?<br> -It'll take a few moments to get the<br> coordinates from the navi-computer.<br> -Are you kidding?<br> Traveling through hyperspace isn't like<br> dusting crops, boy!<br> Without precise calculations we could fly<br> right through a star<br> or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end<br> your trip real quick, wouldn't it?<br> What's that flashing?<br> We're losing our deflector shield.<br> We've entered the Alderaan system.<br> Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to<br> find you holding Vader's leash.<br> I recognized your foul stench when I<br> was brought on board.<br> Charming to the last.<br> You don't know how hard I found it<br> signing the order to terminate your life!<br> I surprised you had the courage to take the<br> responsibility yourself!<br> Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you<br> to be my guest at a ceremony<br> that will make this battle station operational.<br> No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.<br> The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star<br> systems will slip through your fingers.<br> Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.<br> In a way, you have determined the choice of the<br> planet that'll be destroyed first.<br> Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location<br> of the Rebel base,<br> I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of<br> Alderaan.<br> No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons.<br> You can't possibly...<br> You would prefer another target? A military target?<br> Then name the system!<br> I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time.<br> Where is the Rebel base?<br> Dantooine.<br> They're on Dantooine.<br> There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable.<br> ontinue with the operation. You may fire when ready.<br> -What?<br> -You're far too trusting.<br> Dantooine is too remote to make an<br> effective demonstration.<br> But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel<br> friends soon enough.<br> Commence primary ignition.<br> Are you all right? What's wrong?<br> I felt a great disturbance in the Force...<br> as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and<br> were suddenly silenced.<br> I fear something terrible has happened.<br> You'd better get on with your exercises.<br> Well, you can forget your troubles with those<br> Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.<br> Don't everyone thank me at once.<br> Anyway, we should be at Alderaan<br> about oh-two-hundred hours.<br> Now be careful, Artoo.<br> He made a fair move. Screaming about it<br> won't help you.<br> -Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.<br> -But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.<br> That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of<br> their socket when they lose.<br> Wookiees are known to do that.<br> I see your point, sir.<br> I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.<br> Let the Wookiee win.<br> Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing<br> through him.<br> -You mean it controls your actions?<br> -Partially. But it also obeys your commands.<br> Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.<br> You don't believe in the Force, do you?<br> Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy<br> to the other.<br> I've seen a lot of strange stuff,<br> but I've never seen anything to make me believe<br> there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.<br> There's no mystical energy field that controls my<br> destiny.<br> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.<br> I suggest you try it again, Luke.<br> This time, let go your conscious self<br> and act on instinct.<br> With the blast shield down, I can't even see.<br> How am I supposed to fight?<br> Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.<br> Stretch out with your feelings.<br> You see, you can do it.<br> -I call it luck.<br> -In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.<br> Look, going good against remotes is one thing.<br> Going good against the living? That's something else.<br> Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.<br> You know, I did feel something.<br> I could almost see the remote.<br> That's good. You have taken your first<br> step into a larger world.<br> Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.<br> They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.<br> They are now conducting an extensive<br> search of the surrounding systems.<br> She lied! She lied to us!<br> I told you she would never consciously<br> betray the Rebellion.<br> Terminate her...immediately!<br> Stand by, Chewie, here we go.<br> Cut in the sublight engines.<br> What the...?<br> Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor<br> shower. Some kind of asteroid collision.<br> -It's not on any of the charts.<br> -What's going on?<br> Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan!<br> -What do you mean? Where is it?<br> -Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.<br> It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.<br> -What? How?<br> -Destroyed...by the Empire!<br> The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.<br> It'd take a thousand ships with more<br> fire power than I've...<br> -There's another ship coming in.<br> -Maybe they know what happened.<br> It's an Imperial fighter.<br> -It followed us!<br> -No. It's a short range fighter.<br> There aren't any bases around here.<br> Where did it come from?<br> It sure is leaving in a big hurry.<br> If they identify us, we're in big trouble.<br> -Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.<br> -It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.<br> Not for long...<br> A fighter that size couldn't get this<br> deep into space on its own.<br> It must have gotten lost, been part<br> of a convoy or something.<br> Well, he ain't going to be around long enough<br> to tell anyone about us.<br> -Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.<br> -I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in<br> range.<br> That's no moon!<br> -It's a space station.<br> -It's too big to be a space station.<br> -I have a very bad feeling about this.<br> -Turn the ship around.<br> Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse!<br> Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.<br> Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.<br> -Why are we still moving towards it?<br> -We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!<br> -But there's gotta be something you can do!<br> -There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.<br> I'm going to have to shut down.<br> But they're not going to get me without a fight!<br> You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.<br> To you stations! Come with me.<br> We've captured a freighter entering the remains of<br> the Alderaan system.<br> It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its<br> way out of Mos Eisley.<br> They must be trying to return the stolen<br> plans to the princess.<br> She may yet be of some use to us.<br> Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.<br> There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the<br> crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.<br> It must be a decoy, sir. Several<br> of the escape pods have been jettisoned.<br> -Did you find any droids?<br> -No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also<br> have jettisoned.<br> Send a scanning crew on board.<br> I want every part of this ship checked.<br> I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since...<br> Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.<br> I want every part of this ship checked!<br> -Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.<br> -I use them for smuggling.<br> I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in<br> them. This is ridiculous.<br> -Even if I could take off, I'd never get past<br> the tractor beam.<br> -Leave that to me!<br> Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!<br> Who's the more foolish...<br> the fool or the fool who follows him?<br> The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything,<br> report it immediately.<br> All right, let's go.<br> Hey down there,<br> could you give us a hand with this?<br> TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post?<br> TX-four-one-two, do you copy?<br> Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.<br> I'll see what I can do.<br> You know, between his howling and your blasting<br> everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station<br> doesn't know we're here.<br> Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all<br> this sneaking around.<br> -We found the computer outlet, sir.<br> -Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire<br> Imperial computer network.<br> He says he's found the main computer to power the<br> tractor beam that's holding the ship here.<br> He'll try to make the precise location appear<br> on the monitor.<br> The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in<br> seven locations.<br> A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the<br> ship to leave.<br> I don't think you boys can help.<br> I must go alone.<br> Whatever you say. I've done more that I<br> bargained for on this trip already.<br> -I want to go with you.<br> -Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.<br> They must be delivered safely or other star<br> systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.<br> Your destiny lies along a different path than mine.<br> The Force will be with you...always!<br> Boy you said it, Chewie.<br> -Where did you dig up that old fossil?<br> -Ben is a great man.<br> -Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.<br> -I didn't hear you give any ideas...<br> -Well, anything would be better than just hanging<br> around waiting for him to pick us up...<br> -Who do you think...<br> -What is it?<br> -I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.<br> He says "I found her", and<br> keeps repeating, "She's here."<br> -Well, who...who has he found?<br> -Princess Leia.<br> -The princess? She's here?<br> -Princess? What's going on?<br> Where is she?<br> Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three.<br> I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.<br> Oh, no! We've got to do something.<br> The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message..<br> We've got to help her.<br> Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.<br> The old man wants us to wait right here.<br> -I'm not going anywhere.<br> -They're going to execute her.<br> Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to<br> just wait here to be captured. Now all you want<br> to do is stay.<br> Marching into the detention area is not what I<br> had in mind.<br> -But they're going to kill her!<br> -Better her than me...<br> She's rich.<br> Rich?<br> Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her,<br> the reward would be...<br> -What?<br> -Well more wealth that you can imagine.<br> -I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!<br> -You'll get it!<br> -You will...<br> All right, kid.<br> But you'd better be right about this.<br> -All Right<br> -What's your plan?<br> Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?<br> Okay.<br> Now, I'm going to put these on you.<br> Okay. Han, you put these on.<br> Don't worry, Chewie.<br> I think I know what he has in mind.<br> Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...<br> but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're<br> discovered here?<br> -Lock the door!<br> -And hope they don't have blasters.<br> That isn't very reassuring.<br> I can't see a thing in this helmet.<br> -This is not going to work.<br> -Why didn't you say so before?<br> I did say so before!<br> Where are you taking this...thing?<br> Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.<br> I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.<br> He's going to pull us all apart.<br> Watch out!<br> We've got to find out which cell this princess of<br> yours is in.<br> Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven.<br> You go get her. I'll hold them here.<br> Everything is under control. Situation normal.<br> -What happened?<br> -Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction.<br> But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.<br> We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you.<br> -How are you?<br> -We're sending a squad up.<br> Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now.<br> Give us a few minutes to lock it down.<br> Large leak...very dangerous.<br> Who is this? What's your operating number?<br> Boring conversation anyway.<br> Luke! We're going to have company!<br> Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?<br> What? Oh...the uniform.<br> I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.<br> -You're who?<br> -I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.<br> I'm here with Ben Kenobi.<br> -Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?<br> -Come on!<br> -He is here...<br> -Obi-Wan Kenobi!<br> -What makes you think so?<br> -A tremor in the Force.<br> The last time I felt it was in the presence<br> of my old master.<br> -Surely he must be dead by now.<br> -Don't underestimate the Force.<br> The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of<br> the universe.<br> You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.<br> Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three.<br> The princess! Put all sections on alert!<br> Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.<br> If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.<br> Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.<br> Get behind me! Get behind me!<br> -Can't get out that way.<br> -Looks like you managed to cut off our only<br> escape route.<br> Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.<br> See-Threepio! See-Threepio!<br> We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of<br> the cell bay?<br> What was that? I didn't copy!<br> I said, all systems have been alerted to<br> your presence, sir.<br> The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out;<br> all other information on your level is restricted.<br> Open up in there!<br> Oh, no!<br> There isn't any other way out.<br> I can't hold them off forever! Now what?<br> This is some rescue. When you came in here,<br> didn't you have a plan for getting out?<br> -He's the brains, sweetheart.<br> -Well, I didn't...<br> -What the hell are you doing?<br> -Somebody has to save our skins.<br> Into the garbage chute, wise guy.<br> Get in there you big furry oaf!<br> I don't care what you smell!<br> Get in there and don't worry about it.<br> Wonderful girl!<br> Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.<br> Get in there!<br> Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.<br> What an incredible smell you've discovered!<br> Let's get out of here! Get away from there...<br> No! wait!<br> Will you forget it? I already tried it.<br> It's magnetically sealed!<br> Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.<br> Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything<br> under control until you led us down here.<br> You know, it's not going to take them long to figure<br> out what happened to us.<br> It could be worst...<br> -It's worst. -There's something alive in here!<br> -That's your imagination.<br> Something just moves past my leg!<br> Look! Did you see that?<br> What?<br> Luke! Luke! Luke!<br> Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.<br> -Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.<br> -Where?<br> Anywhere! Oh!!<br> Luke! Luke!<br> Grab him!<br> -What happened?<br> -I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...<br> I've got a very bad feeling about this.<br> -The walls are moving!<br> -Don't just stand there.<br> Try to brace it with something.<br> !!!!!!!<br> Wait a minute!<br> Threepio! Come in Threepio!<br> Threepio! Where could he be?<br> Take over!<br> Look there!<br> They're madmen! They're heading for the prison<br> level. If you hurry, you might catch them.<br> Follow me!<br> You stand guard.<br> Come on!<br> Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits<br> of my counterpart here.<br> If you don't mind, I'd like to take him<br> down to maintenance.<br> All right.<br> Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!<br> -Get to the top!<br> -I can't<br> Where could he be? Threepio!<br> Threepio, will you come in?<br> They aren't here! Something must have<br> happened to them.<br> See if they've been captured. Hurry!<br> One thing's for sure. We're all going to<br> be a lot thinner!<br> -Get on top of it!<br> -I'm trying!<br> Thank goodness, they haven't found them!<br> Where could they be?<br> Use the comlink?<br> I forgot I turned it off!<br> -Are you there, sir?<br> -Threepio!<br> -We've had some problems...<br> -Will you shut up and listen to me?<br> Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention<br> level, will you?<br> Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on<br> the detention level.<br> Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention<br> level.<br> No. Shut them all down!<br> Hurry!<br> Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!<br> Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough.<br> It's all my fault! My poor master!<br> Threepio, we're all right!<br> We're all right. You did great.<br> Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on<br> unit number... where are we?<br> If we can just avoid any more female advice, we<br> ought to be able to get out of here.<br> Well, let's get moving!<br> Where are you going?<br> No, wait. They'll hear!<br> Come here, you big coward!<br> Listen. I don't know who you are,<br> or where you came from,<br> but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?<br> Look, Your Worshipfulness,<br> let's get one thing straight!<br> I take orders from one person! Me!<br> It's a wonder you're still alive.<br> Will somebody get this big walking carpet out<br> of my way?<br> No reward is worth this.<br> Give me regular reports.<br> -Do you know what's going on?<br> -Maybe it's another drill.<br> What was that?<br> Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.<br> -There she is.<br> -See-Threepio, do you copy?<br> -Are you safe?<br> -For the moment.<br> Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.<br> We're right above you. Stand by.<br> -You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.<br> -Nice! Come on!<br> It's them! Blast them!<br> -Get back to the ship!<br> -Where are you going? Come back!<br> -He certainly has courage.<br> -What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?<br> I think we took a wrong turn.<br> There's no lock!<br> -That oughta hold it for a while.<br> -Quick, we've got to get across.<br> -Find the control that extends the bridge.<br> -Oh, I think I just blasted it.<br> They're coming through!<br> Here, hold this.<br> Here they come!<br> For luck!<br> Where could they be?<br> Close the blast doors!<br> Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!<br> I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.<br> We meet again, at last.<br> The circle is now complete.<br> When I left you, I was but the learner;<br> now I am the master.<br> Only a master of evil, Darth.<br> Your powers are weak, old man.<br> You can't win, Darth.<br> If you strike me down,<br> I shall become more<br> powerful than you can possibly imagine.<br> You should not have come back.<br> Didn't we just leave this party?<br> -What kept you?<br> -We ran into some old friends.<br> -Is the ship all right?<br> -Seems okay, if we can get to it.<br> Just hope the old man got the tractor<br> beam out of commission.<br> Look!<br> Come on, Artoo, we're going!<br> Now's our chance! Go!<br> Ben!<br> No!<br> -Come on!<br> -Come on!<br> -Luke, its too late!<br> -Blast the door! Kid!<br> Run, Luke! Run!<br> I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if<br> commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.<br> We're coming up on the sentry ships.<br> Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while<br> I charge up the main guns!<br> I can't believe he's gone.<br> -There wasn't anything you could have done.<br> -Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!<br> You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!<br> Here they come!<br> They're coming in too fast!<br> -We've lost lateral controls.<br> -Don't worry, she'll hold together.<br> You hear me, baby? Hold together!<br> Got him! I got him!<br> Great kid! Don't get cocky.<br> There are still two more of them out there!<br> -That's it! We did it!<br> -We did it!<br> Help! I think I'm melting!<br> This is all your fault.<br> -Are they away?<br> -They have just made the jump into hyperspace.<br> You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?<br> I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.<br> Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?<br> You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.<br> That doesn't sound too hard.<br> Besides, they let us go.<br> It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.<br> -Easy...you call that easy? -Their tracking us!<br> -Not this ship, sister.<br> At least the information in Artoo is still intact.<br> What's so important? What's he carrying?<br> The technical readouts of that battle station.<br> I only hope that when the data is analyzed,<br> a weakness can be found.<br> -It's not over yet!<br> -It is for me, sister!<br> I ain't in this for your revolution,<br> and I'm not in it for you, Princess.<br> I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!<br> You needn't worry about your reward.<br> If money is all that you love,<br> then that's what you'll receive!<br> Your friend is quite a mercenary.<br> I wonder if he really cares about anything<br> ...or anyone.<br> I care!<br> -So...what do you think of her, Han?<br> -I'm trying not to, kid!<br> Good...<br> Still, she's got a lot of spirit.<br> Do you think a princess and a guy like me...<br> No!<br> You're safe! We had feared the worst.<br> We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander.<br> You must use the information in this R2 unit<br> to plan the attack. It is our only hope.<br> -Yes.<br> -We are approaching the planet Yavin.<br> The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.<br> We are preparing to orbit the planet.<br> The battle station is heavily shielded<br> and carries a firepower greater than half the<br> star fleet.<br> It's defenses are designed around a<br> direct large-scale assault.<br> A small one-man fighter should be able to<br> penetrate the outer defense.<br> Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub<br> fighters going to be against that?<br> Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man<br> fighter to be any threat,<br> or they'd have a tighter defense.<br> An analysis of the plans provided<br> by Princess Leia has demonstrated<br> a weakness in the battle station.<br> The approach will not be easy.<br> You are required to maneuver straight<br> down this trench<br> and skim the surface to this point.<br> The target area is only two meters wide.<br> It's a small thermal exhaust port,<br> right below the main port.<br> The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.<br> A precise hit will start a chain reaction which<br> should destroy the station.<br> Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.<br> The shaft is ray-shielded,<br> so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.<br> -That's impossible, even for a computer.<br> -It's not impossible.<br> I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen<br> back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.<br> Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!<br> Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.<br> The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in<br> thirty minutes.<br> This will be a day long remembered.<br> It has seen the end of Kenobi<br> and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.<br> All flight trooper, man your stations.<br> All flight troops, man your stations.<br> So...you got your reward and you're just<br> leaving then?<br> That's right, yeah!<br> I got some old debts<br> I've got to pay off with this stuff.<br> Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough<br> to stick around here, do you?<br> Why don't you come with us? You're pretty<br> good in a fight. I could use you.<br> Come on! Why don't you take a look around?<br> You know what's about to happen,<br> what they're up against.<br> They could use a good pilot like you.<br> You're turning your back on them.<br> What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?<br> Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my<br> idea of courage.<br> It's more like suicide.<br> All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han.<br> I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?<br> Hey, Luke...<br> may the Force be with you!<br> What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.<br> -What's wrong?<br> -Oh, it's Han!<br> I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.<br> He's got to follow his own path.<br> No one can choose it for him.<br> I only wish Ben were here.<br> -Luke!<br> -Biggs!<br> How are you?<br> I'll be up there with you!<br> Listen, have I got some stories to tell...<br> Skywalker!<br> Are you sure you can handle this ship?<br> Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the<br> outer rim territories.<br> -You'll do better than all right.<br> -Thank you, sir. I'll try.<br> I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?<br> I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.<br> It's going to be like old times,<br> they'll never stop us.<br> This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.<br> Do you want a new one?<br> Not on your life! That little droid and I have<br> been through a lot together.<br> You okay, Artoo?<br> Good.<br> Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.<br> You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?<br> Luke, the Force will be with you.<br> Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching.<br> Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.<br> All wings report in.<br> -Red Ten standing by.<br> -Red Seven standing by.<br> -Red Three standing by.<br> -Red Six standing by.<br> -Red Nine standing by.<br> -Red Two standing by.<br> -Red Eleven standing by.<br> -Red Five standing by.<br> Lock S-foils in attack position.<br> -We're passing through their magnetic field.<br> -Hold tight!<br> Switch your deflectors on.<br> Double front!<br> -Look at the size of that thing!<br> -Cut the chatter, Red Two.<br> Accelerate to attack speed.<br> -This is it, boys!<br> -Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.<br> -I copy, Gold Leader.<br> We're starting for the target shaft now.<br> We're in position.<br> Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.<br> I see it. Stay low.<br> This is Red Five.<br> I'm going in!<br> Luke, pull up!<br> -Are you all right?<br> -I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.<br> We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're<br> so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!<br> We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.<br> Get the crews to their fighters.<br> -Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the<br> right side of that deflection tower.<br> -I'm on it.<br> -I'm going in, cover me Parkins!<br> -I'm right with you, Red 3!<br> I've go a problem here...<br> -Pull up<br> -No, I'm alright...<br> Rebel base will be in range in seven minutes.<br> Luke, trust your feelings!<br> Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group<br> of signals.<br> -Enemy fighters coming your way.<br> -My scope's negative. I don't see anything.<br> -Keep up your visual scanning.<br> -Here the come.<br> Watch it, you've got one on your tail.<br> I'm hit!<br> -You've picked one up...watch it!<br> -I can't see it!<br> He's on me tight, I can't shake him.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Several fighters have broken off from the main group.<br> Come with me!<br> Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!<br> I'm hit, but not bad.<br> Artoo, see what you can do with it.<br> Red Six can you see Red Five?<br> There's a heavy fire zone on this side.<br> Red Five, where are you?<br> I can't shake him!<br> I'm on him, Luke!<br> Biggs, where are you?<br> -Thanks, Wedge.<br> -Good shooting, Wedge!<br> Red Leader this is Gold Leader.<br> We're starting out attack run.<br> I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.<br> Stay in attack formation!<br> The exhaust post is...<br> Switch power to front deflector screens.<br> How many guns do you think, Gold Five.<br> I'd say about twenty guns.<br> Some on the surface, some on the towers.<br> Death Star will be in range in five minutes.<br> Switching to targeting computer.<br> Computer's locked. Getting a signal.<br> The guns...they've stopped!<br> Stabilize your read deflectors.<br> Watch for enemy fighters.<br> They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.<br> -I'll take them myself! Cover me!<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -I can't maneuver!<br> -We're too close.<br> -We're too close.<br> -Stay on target!<br> Loosen up!<br> Gold Five to Red Leader...<br> Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.<br> -I copy, Gold Five.<br> -They came from behind....<br> We've analyzed their attack, sir,<br> and there is a danger.<br> -Should I have your ship standing by?<br> -Evacuate?<br> In our moment of triumph?<br> I think you overestimate their chances!<br> Rebel base, three minutes and closing.<br> Red Group, this is Red Leader.<br> Rendezvous at mark six point one.<br> -This is Red Two. Flying toward you.<br> -Red Three, standing by.<br> Red Leader, this is Base One.<br> Keep half your group out of range for the next run.<br> Copy, Base One.<br> Luke, take Red Two and Three.<br> Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.<br> This is it!<br> We should be able to see it by now.<br> Keep your eyes open for those fighters!<br> There's too much interference!<br> Red Five, can you see them from where you are?<br> No sign of any...wait!<br> Coming in point three five.<br> I see them.<br> I'm in range.<br> Target's coming up!<br> Just hold them off for a few seconds.<br> Close up formation.<br> Almost there!<br> -You'd better let her loose.<br> I can't hold them!<br> It's away!<br> -It's a hit!<br> -Negative. Negative! It didn't go in.<br> It just impacted on the surface.<br> Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to<br> point oh-five; we'll cover for you.<br> Stay there I just lost my starboard engine.<br> Get set to make your attack run.<br> Rebel base, one minute and closing.<br> Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.<br> -We're going in full throttle.<br> -Right with you, boss.<br> Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?<br> It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.<br> We'll stay back far enough to cover you.<br> My scope shows the tower, but<br> I can't see the exhaust port!<br> Are you sure the computer can hit it?<br> -Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle!<br> -What about the tower?<br> You worry about those fighters!<br> I'll worry about the tower!<br> Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!<br> See if you can't lock it down!<br> I'm hit!<br> -Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more<br> good back there!<br> -Sorry!<br> Let him go! Stay on the leader!<br> Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time.<br> I can't hold them!<br> Artoo, try and increase the power!<br> Hurry up, Luke!<br> Wait!<br> Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.<br> I'm on the leader.<br> Hang on, Artoo!<br> Use the Force, Luke.<br> Let go, Luke.<br> The Force is strong with this one!<br> Luke, trust me.<br> His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your<br> targeting computer.<br> -What's wrong?<br> -I'm all right.<br> I've lost Artoo!<br> The Death Star has cleared the planet.<br> The Death Star has cleared the planet.<br> Rebel base, in range.<br> You may fire when ready.<br> Commence primary ignition.<br> I have you now.<br> What?<br> You're all clear, kid.<br> Now let's blow this thing and go home!<br> Stand by.<br> Stand by.<br> Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.<br> Remember, the Force will be with you...always.<br> -Hey! Hey!<br> -I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!<br> Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and<br> take all the reward.<br> Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.<br> Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something!<br> -You can repair him, can't you?<br> -We'll get to work on him right away.<br> You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears<br> will help, I'll gladly donate them.<br> He'll be all right.<br>
