                        Boy, if I ever wanted to say<br> anything great...<br> now's the time.<br> There's nothing out there<br> for you, Jessie.<br> Except me in a different suit.<br> You think what we have together<br> is blocking you from something.<br> I swear to God, we're getting a divorce<br> when all we need is separate vacations.<br> You don't understand, do you?<br> Look, when I go out that door,<br> what are you gonna do?<br> You're gonna stand here and start<br> crying while I drive around the block...<br> I'm not gonna start crying<br> after you leave.<br> - You're not?<br> - No.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - I'll probably work on my song.<br> It's not like the painting<br> and the photography. It's not.<br> You just have a thing about my voice.<br> I've gotten a lot of terrific feedback<br> on my songs.<br> You don't think so?<br> Just the word "feedback,"<br> it's a stupid word.<br> - Do you mind if I say things my way?<br> - I don't mind.<br> Honey, you can't drag this out,<br> you know.<br> It's not gonna make it any less awful.<br> What's left to say, anyway?<br> That I'm glad that we were married.<br> Thank you. That's lovely.<br> That was lovely, wasn't it?<br> Wasn't that lovely?<br> If there's one thing<br> I didn't expect to do today, it was laugh.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, the day could be<br> chock-full of surprises.<br> I mean, if there's one thing<br> that I didn't expect today...<br> it's that the two of us<br> would end up in bed.<br> Not this time, babe.<br> - Why didn't you throw these away?<br> - I don't know.<br> Maybe I wanted you to find them.<br> "Evermore, Neil".<br> Dear God. "Evermore"?<br> You went to bed<br> with a man that said "evermore"?<br> - Do you want to know about it?<br> - No.<br> No, don't let her sing.<br> Not with that voice.<br> It's gonna be easy for you<br> To do what you got to do<br> Stand up on your own<br> You got it made<br> It's gonna be harder for me<br> But this woman's got a right to be<br> More than a shadow of her man<br> I loved you from my heart<br> Gave the best I had<br> Tried to be your friend<br> Now it's foolish to pretend<br> 'Cause once the feeling's gone<br> It's better to move on<br> It's gonna be hard for me to do<br> - Thank you.<br> - Not anymore.<br> I'm sure I'll cry more tears than you<br> But I've gotta be<br> more than a shadow of my man<br> - Can I have a drink?<br> - Get in here.<br> Goddamn, I'm glad to see you.<br> I finally got you to Boston.<br> I'm glad I'm here, too.<br> Hello, Marva.<br> Will you stop, Marva?<br> Maybe you'd better leave us alone<br> for a while.<br> Sit down, Phil.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Pretty good.<br> Not so great.<br> Bad.<br> Okay.<br> - You gonna let me help you or not?<br> - I don't need any help.<br> I'm gonna help you whether you like it<br> or not. I'm not talking about psychiatry.<br> Psychiatry won't do a thing<br> for me, Mickey.<br> Who's talking psychiatry?<br> I'm not a psychiatrist anymore.<br> I've gone through some changes myself.<br> What are you doing now?<br> I'm teaching psychiatry.<br> If it's okay,<br> I'd really like to be a part of this.<br> Phil, we've never talked about this...<br> but I've always felt like a sister to you.<br> Not a sister-in-law.<br> And, Phil, this could be the best thing<br> that could happen to you.<br> It could be very exciting.<br> The possibilities for growth<br> and self-awareness...<br> getting to know yourself...<br> could be the most wonderfully happy,<br> even thrilling experience.<br> I've got you set up<br> in this Divorced Men's Workshop...<br> they have at the church here.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm not gonna do that.<br> It's not psychiatry.<br> Trust me a little, will you, Phil?<br> I know the way you are. It's just<br> this workshop, one night a week.<br> Mickey, I appreciate that,<br> but I couldn't do that.<br> I couldn't get up in front of a...<br> Hello, in there.<br> Let us do something. Please?<br> Where you going?<br> I don't know.<br> - It hasn't been a real terrific day.<br> - You can use Victor's room.<br> Right.<br> I'm all right. Just exhausted.<br> I'm all right.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> He looks awful.<br> Sure it's all right for me<br> to borrow Tracy's sleeping bag?<br> Of course.<br> I'll get it back to you<br> as soon as I get settled.<br> Thanks for everything, Marva.<br> Call if you get sad.<br> - Can I call if I get happy?<br> - Yeah. Sure.<br> Shit.<br> Attention, shoppers.<br> Right now, in the clothing department...<br> we have Levis for $10.90.<br> We have boys'jeans<br> for $6.90 and $9.90.<br> We have big boys' pants for $7.90.<br> Elaine, register three, please.<br> Hi, Mickey.<br> I'm fine.<br> I was wondering<br> what you two are doing tonight.<br> Is it that late?<br> No, don't be silly.<br> Go back to sleep.<br> You gotta go to work<br> in a couple of hours.<br> Tomorrow night? Sure. Fine.<br> I'll see you then. Good night.<br> Good morning, Mickey.<br> Get the fuck away from me!<br> I've got a knife.<br> I'll cut your fucking balls off, so help me!<br> Come on in.<br> - You're not going to believe...<br> - I was gonna call the police.<br> What's the matter?<br> Marva invited a friend tonight.<br> She was attacked by a pervert<br> just a block from here.<br> Phil, this is Marilyn Holmberg.<br> Marilyn, this is Michael's brother, Phil.<br> On her way here, Marilyn<br> was almost attacked by some pervert.<br> I'm really not this kind of person.<br> I could die.<br> Phil is the pervert.<br> - No. Isn't that marvellous?<br> - I have an excuse.<br> - I took this self-defence course...<br> - Wouldn't you have loved to be there?<br> ...and they told me that<br> if somebody comes down the street...<br> and does something to you,<br> you scare him.<br> You must've gotten<br> very high marks in the course.<br> Phil, what exactly did she say to you?<br> I don't think we should talk about that.<br> Come on.<br> Phil, what did she say?<br> Nothing, really.<br> She said:<br> "Get the fuck away from me...<br> or I'll take this knife<br> and cut your fucking balls off".<br> A really well-bred person<br> would not have repeated that.<br> Dinner.<br> - Did she really say that?<br> - She said that, yeah.<br> Really?<br> I never heard her talk like that.<br> I think Marilyn was very brave.<br> I wish I could have<br> done something like that.<br> No, a well-bred person<br> wouldn't have repeated that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - All right, come on, let's cut that out.<br> - Okay.<br> Listen, I wanna say something,<br> even though it's a little awkward.<br> It's silly.<br> You ought to be able to have a man<br> and a woman to dinner together...<br> without everyone thinking<br> that it's something arranged.<br> In other words, this is not a fix up.<br> It's so nice to see you both.<br> It's been a wonderful evening.<br> Just wonderful. Don't hurt her, Phil.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - She's a terrific woman.<br> She's an extraordinarily gifted<br> nursery school teacher.<br> She's gone back to school to get<br> her Master's in Child Development.<br> She's getting it together.<br> And I, for one, don't want her hurt.<br> I'm not even sure I'm gonna ask her out.<br> Why? Because she doesn't<br> have large breasts?<br> Now, you bundle up.<br> It's cold outside. Take care of yourself.<br> Where are your mittens?<br> We'll have to do this a lot more often.<br> Bye-bye.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> I think that went pretty well.<br> Well, what did you...<br> Oh, dear.<br> You wanna go out tomorrow night?<br> - How long have you been separated?<br> - One month.<br> You wanna go out tomorrow night?<br> No. Look...<br> I mean, really. You have been separated<br> for a very short time.<br> Marva knows how I feel about that.<br> I guess that's why she didn't...<br> Anyway, it's a very intense time for you.<br> - I'm not that intense. I'm a little intense.<br> - Right.<br> Forget it.<br> In the old days, I'd have already been<br> calling my girlfriends...<br> to tell them about you.<br> So don't feel bad. In fact,<br> I'd like it if you called me later on.<br> How much later?<br> Three, four months.<br> Do you know anybody<br> I can go out with now?<br> Now?<br> I feel funny<br> waiting three or four months to call you.<br> Yes. I can see your point.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi. It's me.<br> It's so incredible that you called now.<br> What is it, Jessie?<br> What?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Sorry? What, are you kidding?<br> There's nothing to be sorry about.<br> What's going on?<br> What's wrong, Jessie?<br> Nothing. I just got off the phone.<br> They're gonna release my song<br> as a single.<br> They expect these great things.<br> I just can't believe<br> this is actually taking place.<br> I'm actually living my fantasy.<br> Wonderful. Congratulations.<br> It's just perfect<br> that you're the first to hear.<br> Perfect.<br> Well, how are you?<br> Great. I have this great house...<br> an apartment. And, you know...<br> I have a great view of the trees.<br> And branches.<br> And I've got a window seat.<br> That sounds really great.<br> Yeah, I got this great door<br> with moulding that goes all around.<br> What do you think<br> about us seeing each other again?<br> Honey, didn't you get<br> the notification from the court?<br> Notification?<br> Well, it's final, you know.<br> We're divorced.<br> You know, that thing<br> that you said to me the last night?<br> I'll always treasure it, Phil. Always.<br> What thing?<br> When you said that<br> you were happy that we'd been married.<br> Jessie?<br> Yeah?<br> I've changed my mind.<br> Listen, I may as well say it<br> and get it over with.<br> I started seeing my ex-wife again.<br> Now, I know.<br> I don't know what to say about it.<br> It just...<br> Maybe you're all just gonna have to<br> tie me to the mast till I can get over this.<br> It's this crazy thing he has.<br> He keeps marrying the same woman.<br> I know we can't be together.<br> It doesn't work.<br> But she called.<br> And even though I know<br> how balled up everything always gets...<br> I really can't stay away.<br> I love her.<br> Oh, boy.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I think you get off on being miserable.<br> And when you're not miserable,<br> it feels like something's wrong.<br> Excuse me. I think that is disgusting.<br> Everett, were you divorced recently?<br> It was last July.<br> It was our 43rd wedding anniversary.<br> She said there were no surprises left.<br> What a thing to say.<br> After a lifetime together.<br> A lifetime of faithfulness...<br> despite many urgent temptations.<br> No surprises.<br> I'm gonna be 72 soon.<br> And still, I'm amazed...<br> that the women I meet seem so sure...<br> so certain, about getting involved.<br> You have no idea...<br> how many women want you<br> when you're getting old.<br> How many liver-spotted female hands<br> reach out...<br> to squeeze the last drops<br> from your body...<br> as they go about living<br> longer than we do.<br> Everett, with all due respect...<br> I don't think<br> that's a very healthy attitude.<br> Excuse us, gentlemen.<br> Divorced Women's Workshop<br> meets 9:00 to 10:00.<br> Hi.<br> - Marie?<br> - Phil?<br> Well, I'm not disappointed.<br> The sitter isn't quite here yet.<br> Thank you.<br> Napkin?<br> Hi, loves. Come on in here.<br> Say hi to Mr. Potter.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Phil.<br> I like them to use last names<br> with big people.<br> Phil. Hello.<br> Hello.<br> He doesn't wanna talk. I don't mind.<br> Hello.<br> Hi, what's your...<br> - How old are you?<br> - Five.<br> Are you married?<br> He's funny, isn't he? You're very funny.<br> Nighty-night. Sleep tight.<br> Goodbye.<br> The kids loved you. You loved the kids.<br> You want some more wine?<br> It's gonna be easy for you<br> To do what you got to do<br> Hold your head up high<br> You've got it made<br> It's gonna be<br> There you go. Excuse me.<br> - Well, you like Boston?<br> - A lot.<br> - Hi, you're late.<br> - Yeah, a little.<br> Well, I guess we're ready to go.<br> Listen, we shouldn't be too late.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> The restaurant we're going to,<br> they specialise in duck.<br> Duck. Great.<br> I have to be home by 11:30.<br> - You mean around 11:30.<br> - No, 11:30 at the latest.<br> We'll be back by then.<br> You have to be.<br> 'Cause I have to be home<br> no later than 11:30.<br> I said all right.<br> I went through a lot of depression<br> after my divorce. A lot.<br> But then I decided<br> it's all how you look at it, you know?<br> 'Cause most people<br> only get one chance in life.<br> After a divorce, it's like starting<br> another whole life all over again.<br> So it's really a positive thing.<br> Except for the fact<br> that the first life ended in disaster.<br> - You know what Marilyn said about you?<br> - What?<br> - No, I can't tell you.<br> - Okay.<br> I'd tell you, but I promised her<br> I wouldn't, so I can't tell you.<br> Marilyn said to treat you real good...<br> because you were<br> the biggest one she ever threw back.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I mean, if I didn't seem very attentive.<br> It's just that this is the first date<br> that I've had...<br> in eight years.<br> Welcome back, honey.<br> We sure can use you.<br> Hello.<br> Phil Potter here.<br> You wanna have dinner tomorrow night?<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> - Will you stop with that?<br> - Do you wanna know the reason?<br> - No.<br> I went with a guy for six months<br> who'd just been divorced...<br> and I'd really rather not do that again.<br> - I don't wanna be a nurse.<br> - Look, I'm talking no romance.<br> Just dinner and drinks. No romance.<br> - You think I don't want to. But...<br> - Did you hear what I said?<br> I just wanna have dinner<br> with somebody. Anybody. A person.<br> I'm not gonna touch you.<br> I might not even talk to you.<br> Sounds perfect.<br> - Fine.<br> - Bye.<br> - Hi. Nice to see you again.<br> - Hi.<br> You, too.<br> This is nice.<br> And safe.<br> Here, let me take your coat.<br> Why don't we just sit down...<br> and have some wine?<br> I'm just so nervous for some reason.<br> Most of my stuff hasn't been that great,<br> if you want to know the truth.<br> I don't believe that.<br> I've been getting a lot of freelance work.<br> Where can I read<br> something you've written?<br> On a plane.<br> My stuff is in those airline magazines,<br> right behind the barf bags.<br> - I love those magazines.<br> - Do you really?<br> I happen to be one of those people<br> who reads them all the time.<br> I can't imagine a better job than that.<br> I was thinking about maybe teaching.<br> That's terrific.<br> I was gonna teach this course<br> in Creative Writing at the junior college.<br> - That's fantastic.<br> - It doesn't pay much.<br> Who cares? I know it doesn't pay.<br> - It's rewarding.<br> - It is.<br> That's the thing about teaching.<br> It's rewarding.<br> You don't have kids, do you?<br> I get nervous sometimes<br> about not having kids. 'Cause...<br> if you're over 35,<br> if you have your first baby...<br> all your tubes fall out or something.<br> No, I'm just kidding. Really, it's not true.<br> Sounds horrible. I'm sorry I said that.<br> Anyway, I think I'm...<br> kind of adjusted to not having them.<br> Would you like some more of this?<br> - Did I eat some of that?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's pudding. I hate pudding.<br> I wonder why I ate it.<br> Maybe you were so interested in me...<br> that you didn't know<br> what you were doing.<br> I knew that without the pudding.<br> - Good night.<br> - Would you like to come up?<br> If we're gonna kiss each other,<br> I think it'd be a good idea...<br> if one of us closed our eyes.<br> You first.<br> Okay.<br> God.<br> Don't be afraid to tell me what you want.<br> I think I'd like to say good night.<br> I know. I understand.<br> It's too much or it's too soon.<br> Or you don't like me enough.<br> Or you like me too much.<br> Or you're frightened, or you're guilty.<br> You can't get it up or out or in or what?<br> That just about covers it.<br> I never did like dating.<br> You wanna go out Friday night?<br> Saturday night?<br> Sunday afternoon?<br> Sunday night?<br> When you get to Wednesday, I'm busy.<br> God.<br> Why am I so sure<br> I'm in big trouble here?<br> I'll see you Friday night.<br> Good night, Marilyn.<br> Good night, Potter.<br> You know...<br> a couple of weeks ago...<br> It'll keep.<br> It's not 9:00 yet.<br> I got an Accutron right here.<br> - It's not 9:00. You go ahead.<br> - Don't let them stop you.<br> A couple of weeks ago, I met this girl.<br> A really nice girl. I like her a lot.<br> It's just that, for some reason...<br> I've been avoiding going to bed with her.<br> This is why it's good that we talk.<br> You know, we find out that we're not<br> as weird as we thought we were.<br> I felt the same way once.<br> You're afraid to open up. To care.<br> You end up questioning your ability<br> to love someone in a meaningful way.<br> - Fuck off!<br> - Eat shit!<br> I think it's natural.<br> You still feel like you're married.<br> Maybe she's special.<br> It's possible, you know?<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Fine.<br> I'm sorry. I should have called.<br> I was outside and I just popped in.<br> I'll be going now.<br> I'll call next time before I come by.<br> Would you get in here?<br> There's nobody here.<br> - Did you do all this for yourself?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why not fuss for yourself?<br> Looks like something you'd read<br> in a book on how to be single.<br> - Yeah. I think that's where I got it.<br> - I got a job.<br> Really?<br> I'm gonna teach this course<br> at a junior college and it...<br> Do you mind if we talk<br> about you and me?<br> Please do.<br> I don't know how to put this<br> without coming straight out.<br> I wish you would.<br> Well, I've got two things<br> that I just gotta get off my mind tonight.<br> One is I'm very nervous about<br> teaching this class for the first time.<br> Why am I so sure<br> that number two is the killer?<br> I wanna have sex with you.<br> Gulp.<br> I don't like the way you put that.<br> It makes me feel very strange.<br> I know. It did sound<br> a little bit like Tarzan.<br> It's just that I was trying to avoid<br> the whole romantic thing...<br> I don't like that, either. I hate that.<br> But can't you just personalize it a little?<br> I want to have sex with you, Marilyn?<br> I want to have sex with you, Marilyn.<br> I want to have sex with you, Potter.<br> Take it easy. I'm not that good.<br> I won't let anyone do that to me.<br> I just won't!<br> Will you get in the car?<br> Do you think I'm a one-nighter? Do you?<br> - Will you get in the car before you...<br> - I am no one-nighter. I'm a teacher!<br> I'm going for my Master's!<br> I am no one-nighter!<br> Will you get in the car<br> before you catch pneumonia?<br> And even if I have been,<br> I won't be that for you.<br> I left you a note.<br> - You did not.<br> - I left you a note.<br> And what did it say?<br> I'll see you tonight<br> and I hope you understand.<br> How'd you sign it?<br> Best wishes for your continued success,<br> Phillip Potter.<br> It's a joke!<br> - I'll see you tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> If you can avoid it...<br> I'd prefer you didn't act crazy anymore.<br> I think I could love this man.<br> Oh, God.<br> I really didn't know<br> that I was saying that. It just...<br> came out. I'm really sorry.<br> Just forget about it, okay?<br> I just say that to all the boys.<br> I'm gonna go in now.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> I'm Phil Potter.<br> I'm gonna be right upfront with you<br> and tell you where I'm coming from.<br> Those are college expressions,<br> aren't they?<br> I've never taught a class before.<br> I've never even taken a course<br> in magazine writing.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I didn't graduate from college.<br> The next time we meet,<br> I'd like you to bring a magazine article...<br> that you find particularly interesting.<br> And we'll discuss it.<br> I'm looking forward to getting to know...<br> each and every one of you individually.<br> And I'll see you all next Wednesday.<br> Mr. Potter.<br> The class isn't over till 10:00.<br> Good.<br> That gives me a chance to answer<br> all your questions for the next...<br> I should've prepared<br> more material for today.<br> From now on, I'll be able to<br> gauge the time a little better.<br> Or I'll learn to talk very slowly.<br> Now, why did you do that?<br> - Does anybody here like to be hit?<br> - No.<br> So what are we gonna do<br> if we're angry?<br> - Is it okay to be angry?<br> - Yes.<br> Sometimes you're gonna be so angry<br> you're gonna feel like hitting.<br> But you know what you can do instead?<br> You can do this.<br> Try it.<br> I want to try it. Everyone, watch me.<br> Phil...<br> I have this little girl in school...<br> I can't stop thinking about.<br> I'm worried that I'm really screwing<br> her up. She's really this clingy kid...<br> and she's always throwing<br> her arms around your neck or your legs.<br> I don't know. Maybe I should<br> call her mother or something.<br> We're gonna have a carnival at school<br> to raise money.<br> We have it every year.<br> It's a lot of fun. It's sort of fun.<br> I think you should come.<br> Well, if you feel like it and...<br> Aren't you a little old for this?<br> Apparently not.<br> This is gonna be a terrific picture.<br> You're gonna love this.<br> This insensitivity really bothers me.<br> - It's a side of you I've never seen before.<br> - Really? It's my best side.<br> This is gonna be all right.<br> It's starting to look pretty good now.<br> - You can almost see a boob.<br> - Would you stop it?<br> - Are you crazy?<br> - Give me that.<br> - No.<br> - Give it to me.<br> Look at this picture.<br> We're talking Penthouse here.<br> You wanna see it? Look.<br> God.<br> Are you mad?<br> Are you really mad?<br> You're mad.<br> - Happy Thanksgiving.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's turkey time.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - Here, let me get that.<br> I didn't know that you could do...<br> Isn't that marvellous?<br> - I know you want a leg, Victor.<br> - Yeah.<br> Let's see if you know how to carve yet.<br> That is so lovely.<br> - You two look so happy.<br> - That's not happiness, that's afterglow.<br> Michael.<br> You know, somehow this place<br> still misses, Marva.<br> Here, take some of this.<br> When you get that sofa here,<br> it'll pull the whole room together.<br> - What sofa?<br> - I may have mentioned it.<br> I'm having trouble here, Victor,<br> but I'll have it for you.<br> Here. Let me show you how to do it.<br> Wait a second.<br> Michael will help you, but I don't know<br> how much help he's...<br> Will you stop? You never knew<br> how to cut. Let me show you how to...<br> You really do it quite well.<br> Will you cut it out?<br> There you go, Victor.<br> My hands are clean. Honest.<br> Won't you get the phone,<br> honey, please?<br> Hello. Yeah, who is it?<br> Phil, it's Jessica.<br> Go change your clothes.<br> Excuse me.<br> Thank you.<br> I think I did that very well.<br> How're you doing at school?<br> Are you ready to start your thesis yet?<br> It's harder than I thought.<br> Hi. How are you?<br> Fine.<br> Are you still staying at our place?<br> It's difficult being in school<br> when you have a full-time...<br> - Fine.<br> - job.<br> Yeah, I guess it has crossed my mind.<br> I read an article where it said that...<br> - women returning to school do...<br> - Not right now.<br> incredibly well.<br> Come on, Jessie. It's not us.<br> It's just the holidays. I mean,<br> everybody feels like that on a holiday.<br> This is the best turkey I ever had.<br> No, I'm not acting funny.<br> Listen, you picked the wrong time<br> to have a long conversation.<br> We're just sitting down<br> for Thanksgiving dinner.<br> Mickey, Marva, Victor...<br> She says hi.<br> Hi.<br> Tomorrow, maybe we could talk. Yeah.<br> I told you. Mickey, Marva, Victor,<br> and a friend of theirs.<br> Yeah.<br> We could talk tomorrow.<br> Okay.<br> So long, Jessie.<br> You know, this really looks delicious.<br> - The stuffing.<br> - I know, I can't wait.<br> Listen...<br> we're family.<br> And we're gonna get out of here<br> right after dinner...<br> - and give you two some privacy.<br> - Hurry up and eat, Victor.<br> - You said I'm supposed to chew.<br> - Don't chew.<br> Take your time, Victor.<br> Everybody can take their time.<br> If you'll excuse us for a moment.<br> Marilyn, would you like to take a walk?<br> We're gonna take a walk.<br> How could you call me a friend?<br> It's good that you<br> got that out of your system.<br> Of theirs!<br> - You have to learn not to hit.<br> - So do you.<br> The hell with it.<br> If you're gonna be angry,<br> just do like this.<br> Take your hands off me.<br> Put your hands on me.<br> I'm sorry I called you my friend.<br> You're not my friend. You're my...<br> Well, you're not my friend.<br> I don't know why I said that.<br> I do know why I said that.<br> It's because I'm nervous.<br> I haven't talked to her in a long time.<br> For some reason,<br> when I got on the phone...<br> I felt like I was cheating on my wife.<br> I know that was stupid. That was really<br> stupid of me. But I know why.<br> It's because it's Thanksgiving.<br> And the turkey.<br> Listen...<br> before I met you...<br> I'd finally gotten to the point in my life<br> where I no longer thought...<br> some man was gonna come along...<br> and make this huge change.<br> I'd finally gotten to the point where...<br> I liked being unattached.<br> I liked going to parties<br> and occasionally meeting some guy...<br> who convinces himself real quick<br> that he's falling in love with you and...<br> Is it okay talking to you like this?<br> Almost.<br> You're great.<br> You are.<br> No, you are.<br> - Then it's settled?<br> - No.<br> See, the reason...<br> that I'm telling you all these intimate<br> details about my past is that...<br> so much of the time with them,<br> I'd end up being tense.<br> And the part<br> that I really liked best was...<br> hearing the door click after they left,<br> and then I'd...<br> breathe easier.<br> You bastard.<br> I don't... breathe right without you.<br> I just breathe right when you're here.<br> It scares the daylights out of me.<br> Jesus. I mean,<br> who are we kidding here?<br> You're hung up on your ex-wife.<br> It's one of those.<br> I'd better just save my ass. Goodbye.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Are you telling me<br> that you're breaking up with me?<br> I'm going to take you home now...<br> and I'm going to see you<br> tomorrow night.<br> I'm busy.<br> You mean, I can't see you<br> because I did one dumb thing?<br> One dumb thing.<br> Good shot, Howard.<br> Now tell your father to spend it all.<br> Spend it all.<br> Listen, I haven't seen<br> the mothers throwing.<br> Let's see the mothers come in there...<br> and this daughter.<br> Jo, you have a good arm.<br> Now the parents seem to be taking<br> all the balls.<br> I'm never going to get wet, kids.<br> The game is fixed. It's fixed, that's all.<br> Good shot.<br> Anybody else have one? A ball?<br> Very good shot.<br> Anybody else can do that?<br> Okay, let's see who can...<br> Why don't you<br> give somebody else a chance?<br> - Would you like a chance?<br> - No, I'm having fun watching.<br> Come on, kids. I've seen you throw<br> a lot better than this.<br> Cut it the fuck out!<br> Mummy, she said the "F" word.<br> No, she didn't, honey.<br> It just sounded like she said it.<br> You handle this, okay?<br> Will you talk normally to me now?<br> The reason that you went berserk<br> when Jessica called is that...<br> you don't know where we stand.<br> If I'd have asked you to move in with me,<br> you would have been able to handle it.<br> So what do you think?<br> Will you move in with me?<br> You can keep your apartment<br> and everything.<br> Okay. Are you sure?<br> - Are you sure?<br> - No.<br> Okay, I'll see you later at...<br> How am I going to get in?<br> I don't have a key.<br> I told the super to let you in.<br> Not quite being carried<br> over the threshold, but it'll do.<br> It's a good thing that I cleaned out<br> one of the drawers for you.<br> - Can you duplicate this key?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Terrific.<br> Hi.<br> We were wondering what kept you.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> You've been here long?<br> - About three hours?<br> - Longer, I think.<br> - What did keep you?<br> - I walked home.<br> - I'm gonna finish unpacking.<br> - Okay.<br> I'll just be a few minutes.<br> Can you believe my timing?<br> Yeah.<br> - Are you staying long?<br> - No, just tonight.<br> I'm staying at a hotel by the airport.<br> Listen, this isn't a logical visit.<br> I had an impulse to come here.<br> An impulse I've had before,<br> by the way, only...<br> this time I decided to follow it.<br> I figured it was time for one of us<br> to be impulsive.<br> Though I'm sorry about the blouse.<br> I swear to God, I kept my coat on...<br> for at least half an hour<br> after I got here...<br> but she had the heat turned up.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Why?<br> - Are you all right?<br> - No.<br> I got to talk to her, you know.<br> I can't avoid her.<br> - She seems like a very nice person.<br> - Yeah.<br> There's not too much<br> you can tell about someone...<br> the very first time you meet them.<br> Except, of course,<br> that she has pretty tits.<br> Hey.<br> Well, what do you do?<br> Carry that around for emergencies?<br> What is it?<br> Well, think of it as a housewarming gift.<br> It's a swell gift.<br> Thank you.<br> I think I'd better<br> leave you two alone for a while.<br> You know, the hardest part for me...<br> is walking through the hall<br> and out the door.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm gonna just get out of your way<br> for a little while.<br> - You've been terrific. Thanks a lot.<br> - Goodbye.<br> I didn't think it was gonna be this tough.<br> I did.<br> I had all these questions I was going<br> to ask you and now I don't feel like it.<br> Well, that's all right, Jessie.<br> I'll ask you some questions.<br> How are you doing?<br> You name it, I...<br> Professionally, things have really been...<br> You're right.<br> I really don't want to hear about that.<br> That's our choice here, Phil.<br> Answers we don't care about<br> or questions we can't ask.<br> That's a nice phrase.<br> You're on your way to another song.<br> Would you give me a break?<br> This is kind of a rough afternoon.<br> What did you expect?<br> You sprawled out on the sofa,<br> suffering from malnutrition...<br> muttering my name.<br> You sure are a sight for sore eyes.<br> Well, how do I look, anyway?<br> As good as you wanted to look.<br> That good?<br> That good.<br> We thought we'd take the car<br> and go get a cup of coffee.<br> If it's all right?<br> I'm studying for my Master's.<br> I always thought<br> that the toughest thing about...<br> - My coat.<br> - going back for your Master's was...<br> getting used to being back<br> in school again...<br> just when you're at a point<br> that you really...<br> - You have your Master's?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Your scarf.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Nice meeting you again.<br> - You, too. Bye-bye.<br> - I'll walk you back.<br> - No, that's okay.<br> - No, I'll walk you back.<br> - Okay.<br> I'm going to walk Marilyn back.<br> I'd ask you up, but my roommate<br> has an exam in the morning.<br> I'm just gonna drop her off<br> at the motel. I'll be right back.<br> I'll be right back.<br> I just had to have some contact.<br> - Okay, so you're still mad at me.<br> - Why should I be mad at you?<br> Because I went to bed with your boss<br> and broke up our marriage.<br> Oh, that.<br> You're right. I am still mad at you.<br> Well, sure you are. It's natural.<br> This mad isn't natural.<br> I'm sitting here, trying not to hit you.<br> Maybe it would be good<br> if you talked about it.<br> Jesus.<br> Would it help if I let you<br> hit me in the arm or something?<br> Seriously, it might make you feel better.<br> I think if you gave me permission<br> to hit you in the arm and I did it...<br> it'd be the saddest day of my life.<br> Hi. Could you send up<br> a bucket of ice, please? 923.<br> Better than ever<br> I'm better than ever<br> You'll never go looking for anyone else<br> I needed some time till I found myself<br> And now I'm better than ever<br> I'll be better than ever<br> I wrote this song for us.<br> We'll never say goodbye again<br> Throw off your shoes and come on in<br> Say hello to an old romance<br> Say hello to a second chance<br> Where you been so long, my love?<br> Come on back where you belong<br> You and me<br> together<br> Better than ever<br> This time forever<br> Baby, I missed your tender touch<br> I been out on my own<br> and I learned so much<br> Come on, let me show you<br> Come on, let me hold you<br> Don't be scared<br> of what might come of this<br> I've been saving up all my tenderness<br> Better than ever<br> It's got to be better<br> Hey, hey, hey<br> Better than ever<br> It's got to be better<br> Have you lost your marbles?<br> Look at us.<br> We're a couple.<br> Yeah.<br> There's something to be said for that.<br> Does my putting my hand on<br> your shoulder make you react like that?<br> Just touching you<br> makes you that excited?<br> Apparently.<br> It's incredible.<br> I know.<br> It's amazing, isn't it?<br> Marilyn?<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Where are you?<br> - Home.<br> - Your apartment?<br> - Yeah, of course. What did you think?<br> I don't know. It was getting late.<br> I was beginning to worry.<br> I was afraid you weren't in an accident.<br> - Get over here.<br> - You sure?<br> - Will you get over here?<br> - Okay, I'll be right there.<br> I'm sure.<br> Hi. I just wanted to say that...<br> I'm very embarrassed by the way<br> I behaved tonight and I...<br> well, I don't know quite<br> what to say now, except...<br> the thing about love is that you can<br> really make an ass of yourself.<br> Goodbye, Phil.<br> Goodbye, Jessie.<br> I went to a bar the other night and<br> a bunch of guys were sitting around...<br> watching the game on TV.<br> And it was really great.<br> You know, you can forget how wonderful<br> male companionship can be.<br> My ex-wife came to see me.<br> - The first time since you split?<br> - Yeah.<br> I wish I could forget about her.<br> Tell me about it.<br> You know, my ex-wife is talking about<br> us getting married again.<br> This'll be the fourth time.<br> She thinks that this time,<br> we should have a big wedding.<br> It's ridiculous when there are people<br> in our family who don't even know...<br> we got divorced again.<br> For the first six months<br> after Ellen and I split up...<br> I used to carry a coat over my arm...<br> so she couldn't see<br> what was going on with me.<br> But it passes. You get rid of it.<br> That's a sad day, when you can't<br> imagine ever being in bed with her.<br> Marilyn's a wonderful girl.<br> She's got a great sense of humour.<br> She makes me laugh<br> at the strangest times.<br> What did you and your ex-wife do<br> when you were together?<br> Nothing much. Went for a drive.<br> And then I hit her on the arm.<br> Then we went into this snow bank<br> and we had to get towed out.<br> Went to a motel<br> and she played this song for me...<br> that she wrote about the two of us.<br> And I left.<br> Is that all?<br> I never wanted a woman<br> so much in my life.<br> You know, I have to work tonight<br> or I'd give you a lift.<br> It's okay.<br> I'll give you a lift.<br> Where are we going?<br> Bloomingdale's.<br> I'm gonna meet Marilyn.<br> - Can I make one small suggestion?<br> - Sure.<br> Forget about your wife<br> and stay with Marilyn.<br> It's only a suggestion.<br> - But I want you to love it.<br> - I like it.<br> You just like it because it's<br> the same thing you have in your office.<br> What's wrong with my office?<br> It makes you feel like a grown-up.<br> This is a perfect sofa.<br> This is your basic perfect sofa.<br> Boy, it's hot in here, isn't it?<br> Is that a window?<br> No.<br> This is not a great night<br> for me to be buying a sofa.<br> Why don't you just sit in it?<br> Watch out. Once you sit in it,<br> you won't want to get up.<br> See? What'd I tell you?<br> I was just about to panic.<br> Mickey...<br> I feel so stupid<br> making you come down here. I'm sorry.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Mickey, I'm feeling...<br> much better now. You know, Mick...<br> I always loved Dad.<br> I always loved Daddy.<br> - You know I loved Daddy?<br> - Don't go overboard, you know?<br> He was a nice guy,<br> but he died when you were two.<br> It's just that I can't breathe.<br> - Should I call an ambulance?<br> - No.<br> - You know I'd never lie to you, right?<br> - You don't have to tell me that, Mickey.<br> - I know you wouldn't lie to me.<br> - Right. I'm telling you you're okay.<br> You're full of shit. I can't breathe.<br> I swear, I'm okay.<br> Does anyone have a Valium?<br> Here, take this. That's it.<br> All right? Take another one.<br> Anybody got a paper bag?<br> You're having an anxiety problem,<br> that's all.<br> When this paper bag comes, I want you<br> to put it over your mouth and nose...<br> and breathe normally, and you'll be<br> all right in a minute. There.<br> Now, just do what I tell you and...<br> Get me a regular bag.<br> Sorry, I'm a total schmuck.<br> No. Breathe normally. In. Out.<br> That's a boy.<br> Now, you're gonna feel all right<br> in a minute.<br> When you wanna talk, just talk.<br> If you don't wanna talk, don't talk.<br> Mickey?<br> I'm starting to feel better.<br> - I just hyperventilated, right?<br> - Exactly.<br> Now, you inhale your carbon dioxide,<br> and that's all there is to it.<br> - How much longer do I have to do this?<br> - You can stop anytime.<br> - I think I'd like to stop now.<br> - Go ahead, then.<br> I'm sorry, Marilyn.<br> - There's nothing to be ashamed of.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Sit up. That's it. Just sit up here.<br> All right. Okay.<br> - You gotta help me.<br> - Let's go.<br> Now, he's gonna be all right, you know?<br> It's anxiety, that's all.<br> He's perfectly all right now.<br> You're buttoning that wrong.<br> - I don't care.<br> - Here, let me do it.<br> Don't button my shirt.<br> It makes me feel like a kid.<br> What do you care? If you're gonna<br> button it, button it right. All right?<br> Thank you for buttoning my shirt.<br> What the hell. I love you.<br> - Give me a ring tomorrow?<br> - Yeah. Are you an early riser?<br> Yeah.<br> - There's nothing to be ashamed of.<br> - Yeah.<br> You were wonderful.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I have to see Jessica.<br> - Let me help you.<br> - No, it's all right.<br> I'll just have to make a few trips.<br> Just leave everything. I'll take care of it.<br> - Thanks very much.<br> - It's all right.<br> - I want you to do something for me.<br> - Sure.<br> - You won't let me down?<br> - I won't let you down.<br> That's true enough.<br> In a weird sort of way,<br> you're an honourable guy.<br> Okay, don't see me again.<br> All right.<br> I wanna be sure.<br> Don't answer too quick.<br> We're talking about a commitment here,<br> you know?<br> I want you to swear that if...<br> things don't work out<br> with this other lady, or...<br> any other other lady, you don't just...<br> hit the old phone book<br> and come up with my number.<br> - You think I'd do that?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> It scares me you don't know that.<br> Okay, I said I wouldn't.<br> I want you to swear<br> on your brother's life.<br> Oh, God.<br> No, I want it. That's what I want.<br> Would you do that, please?<br> I swear on my brother's life<br> I won't call you again.<br> Never.<br> Thanks.<br> You're welcome.<br> No! God, are you kidding me?<br> Goodbye.<br> Would you please leave?<br> Welcome home.<br> It's really good to see you, Mr. Potter.<br> Isn't it good?<br> We can relax this time<br> Glad you came back<br> While I'm still in my prime<br> You're looking better<br> Than you did before<br> And I'm glad you kept the keys<br> To your favourite front door<br> Starting over<br> It feels like the first time tonight<br> We're gonna do it, baby<br> Do it till we get it right<br> No one's been lying<br> on your side of the bed<br> I've just been sleeping<br> with my songs instead<br> Looks as though<br> you lost a pound or two<br> Don't worry, babe<br> I'll put some weight back on you<br> Starting over<br> Feels like the first time tonight<br> We're gonna do it, baby<br> Do it till we get it right<br> The way that you're looking at me<br> Isn't it silly? I'm scared.<br> Scared<br> That's not how I thought it would be<br> I spent the morning<br> getting perfectly dressed<br> So you could take off<br> all the clothes you like best<br> You've forgotten<br> You're in for a treat<br> But try and remember<br> I like everything neat<br> Do it, baby<br> Do it till we get it right<br> It's a little strange<br> being back together again, isn't it?<br> - Strained?<br> - Strange.<br> I should be a little more direct with you.<br> You know,<br> when we made love last night...<br> I know what you're gonna say.<br> You don't have to say it.<br> I had a vaginal orgasm.<br> Marilyn.<br> I can't keep on making excuses.<br> - He wants to meet you.<br> - I'm coming.<br> Well, it's getting embarrassing.<br> He knows you're in here.<br> At least go meet him.<br> There's no way<br> we're gonna like each other.<br> Just because<br> he's a professional athlete?<br> - I don't think I'm what he's looking for.<br> - Marilyn.<br> Come on.<br> Marilyn, this is John Morganson.<br> Hello.<br> Good to meet you.<br> Same here.<br> What is it?<br> No, it's nothing.<br> I'm sorry.<br> She's had a tough time recently.<br> John's used to strange reactions.<br> We went into it when he was my patient.<br> No, it wasn't him.<br> It has to do with a tension people feel<br> over the disparity in height.<br> And there's a sexual element...<br> It has to...<br> No, I'm sorry.<br> You know, with everything else,<br> people feel:<br> "Is everything on such a grand scale?"<br> And is it?<br> Yes.<br> - What kind of coffee do you want?<br> - Colombian's good.<br> If you want Colombian,<br> we might as well get Folgers.<br> - Costa Rican is terrific.<br> - I don't want Costa Rican.<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't know why.<br> Maybe because I don't know<br> where Costa Rica is.<br> It seems like you should know where<br> it is before you drink their coffee.<br> Why don't you tell me some countries<br> bordering Costa Rica...<br> and I'll drink their coffee<br> the rest of my life?<br> - That one may have been my fault.<br> - That's okay.<br> We're not exactly doing terrific, are we?<br> But that's okay, too. That's why<br> we're probably better off this time...<br> because we don't need terrific anymore.<br> - Are you crazy?<br> - I'm not the crazy one.<br> Can we stay out of this?<br> I need terrific. I need wonderful.<br> I need love.<br> I need a half a pound of potato salad<br> and a loaf of rye bread, please.<br> Just relax, will you? Panama<br> and Nicaragua border Costa Rica.<br> What is going on with you anyway?<br> It just occurred to me that<br> this might all be about what's her name.<br> I'm sorry. I owe you more than that.<br> I know her name. It's Marilyn.<br> Marilyn Holmberg, isn't it?<br> And isn't that what all this is about?<br> I was hoping it wasn't.<br> I was hoping it wasn't<br> what I thought it would be.<br> I'm finding myself and you're losing me<br> Look, I don't exactly expect thanks<br> for arranging this party...<br> but I'd like to see what you could do<br> for $5 a man.<br> Hey, sorry to interrupt.<br> It's okay. We're just comparing<br> our worst Christmases.<br> Paul, I hate to drag you away.<br> Do you mind giving me a lift?<br> - I can give you a lift.<br> - We could actually pile into my car.<br> One week's notice, $5 a man,<br> and they expect a Mardi Gras.<br> - You wanna leave now?<br> - If you don't mind.<br> Sure.<br> I'm gonna miss you guys.<br> Same here, Phil.<br> You look like you feel great.<br> What's your secret?<br> Marilyn?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you gentlemen finished?<br> - No.<br> But perhaps you'd care to join us?<br> We're having a little party.<br> They're asking us<br> to come down and join them.<br> I don't have any place else to go.<br> I don't know,<br> they weren't yelling or anything.<br> They seem perfectly normal and decent.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yeah, let's do it.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> My name is Stephanie.<br> - And this is Barry.<br> - I'm Larry.<br> - Dan.<br> - Jerry.<br> And I'm Everett.<br> But if she hasn't talked to you yet...<br> It'll mean a lot to her.<br> She's gonna love it. It's symbolic.<br> But what's it mean?<br> I don't know.<br> Marilyn. It's me, Phil.<br> I bought the couch!<br> Hello.<br> Hello. Great. Listen, I know I promised<br> I wouldn't call you, but this is important.<br> This is Marilyn. I just got this thing.<br> I hope it works,<br> because I'm not here right now.<br> So if you just leave a message...<br> before you hear the beep,<br> I'll hopefully get it.<br> Marilyn, this is Potter.<br> I have my life<br> kind of in the right place right now.<br> - And I don't...<br> - Beep.<br> You don't even know if she'll be there.<br> Marva told me that she goes<br> to all his practice sessions.<br> She didn't give you any sign<br> she was willing to listen to you.<br> The sofa is going to mean<br> a lot to her. I know her.<br> When she sees the sofa,<br> everything is gonna be okay.<br> - How can you be so sure?<br> - I'm not.<br> I know.<br> It's not easy out here.<br> It's hard to find someone<br> you can really count on.<br> But one thing you can be sure of.<br> You don't have to worry about<br> a bug, a rat, or a roach...<br> as long as you live.<br> No, really. Stop.<br> Hey, Marilyn. Hey, sweet stuff.<br> I have a team meeting.<br> I'll come see you later.<br> No, I mean it.<br> Really, no.<br> Look, Potter, I'm sorry if it hurts you.<br> And you'll always be very special to me.<br> - But I'm over you.<br> - You can't be.<br> Why?<br> Because you got me in trouble,<br> and now you got to marry me.<br> Look. Just do me a favour.<br> Don't you just come in here<br> and sweep me off my feet.<br> Just talk to me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I know we got a lot to talk about.<br> All I've thought about is you<br> for the last six weeks.<br> I'm really...<br> excited that you proposed to me.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Do whatever you wanna do.<br> We can go slower.<br> What do you want?<br> What do you want?<br> I want us to live together.<br> I want us to get married.<br> I want us to have kids<br> and watch them grow up.<br> I want us to put our teeth<br> in the same glass at night.<br> I want us to be buried in a family plot...<br> with the same headstone.<br> What do you want?<br> I want a separate glass for my teeth.<br> If I don't touch you soon,<br> I'm gonna go out of my mind.<br> This is the best hug<br> I ever had in my life.<br> You got the couch.<br>
