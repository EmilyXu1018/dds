                        Our state fair is a<br> great state fair<br> Don't miss it<br> Don't even be late<br> It's dollars to doughnuts<br> that our state fair<br> Is the best state fair in our state<br> Our state fair is a<br> great state fair<br> Don't miss it<br> Don't even be late<br> It's dollars to doughnuts<br> that our state fair<br> Is the best state fair in our state<br> Take it easy, Blue Boy. Your<br> supper will be here any minute.<br> I wish I knew what was<br> keeping that feller.<br> Our state fair is a<br> great state fair<br> Don't miss it<br> Don't even be late<br> It's dollars to doughnuts<br> that our state fair<br> Is the best state fair in our state<br> Dad! Daddy, I just had<br> Mr. Cramer on the phone.<br> He said Dave Miller stopped<br> by his place 10 minutes ago<br> - to put water in his radiator.<br> - Thanks, daughter.<br> Margy?<br> - Have you finished your packing?<br> - Not yet. I was just going to.<br> I don't know what's got into you lately.<br> All you do is sit around and mope.<br> I don't sit around and mope.<br> Well, stop moping now and<br> finish your packing.<br> Always saying she doesn't<br> know what's got into me.<br> I'll be glad to get to the fair,<br> hear something different, see<br> something different for a change.<br> What has got into me, anyway?<br> The things I used to like<br> I don't like anymore<br> I want a lot of other things<br> I've never had before<br> It's just like Mother says<br> I sit around and mope<br> Pretending I am wonderful<br> And knowing I'm a dope<br> - Margy?<br> - Yes, Mother?<br> As soon as you're finished, I want you to<br> come down and help me with the pickles.<br> In a minute, Mother.<br> Pickles!<br> I'm as restless as a willow<br> In a windstorm<br> I'm as jumpy as a puppet<br> On a string<br> I'd say that I had spring fever<br> But I know it isn't spring<br> I'm starry-eyed and<br> vaguely discontented<br> Like a nightingale<br> without a song to sing<br> Oh, why should I have spring fever<br> When it isn't even spring<br> I keep wishing<br> I were somewhere else<br> Walking down a strange, new street<br> Hearing words that<br> I have never heard<br> From a man I've yet to meet<br> I'm as busy as a spider<br> Spinning daydreams<br> I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing<br> I haven't seen a<br> crocus or a rosebud<br> Ora robin on the wing<br> But I feel so gay<br> In a melancholy way<br> That it might as well be spring<br> It might as well be<br> Spring<br> Margy!<br> I'm coming, Mother.<br> Come on, boy.<br> Ah, he'll win first this year sure.<br> He's half again the hog<br> he was last year.<br> You don't really expect to win, do<br> you, with that animated lard can?<br> Say, listen, you can say<br> anything you please about me,<br> but don't say anything bad<br> about Blue Boy.<br> That's the finest Hampshire<br> boar that ever breathed.<br> If you think that, he's<br> just as good as beat now.<br> Be better if he was<br> third or fourth best.<br> - He'd stand a better chance.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> If a hog or a man ever got what<br> he was entitled to just once,<br> the eternal stars would quit<br> making melody in the spheres.<br> Oh, there you go<br> with that book talk again.<br> I say he's the best hog in the state,<br> and the judges will say so too.<br> They might.<br> But if that turns out good,<br> then something else<br> will probably happen.<br> - He might catch pneumonia...<br> - Oh!<br> or hog cholera,<br> or you might catch pneumonia.<br> Or something might happen<br> to Wayne or Margy.<br> Oh!<br> Mark my words, Abel, there's<br> compensation in this world.<br> For every good, there's bad. Now,<br> Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us...<br> I don't care what<br> Waldo Emerson tells us!<br> Look, I'll just make<br> a little bet with you.<br> - On what?<br> - I'll bet you we go to the fair...<br> and Blue Boy<br> will win the grand award.<br> And nothing bad will happen<br> to him, me or my family.<br> Yes, and we'll all have<br> a good time too<br> and be better off for it<br> after the fair is over.<br> It's a foolish bet, Abel. If you'd<br> asked me, I'd have given you 10-to-1.<br> But you didn't ask me,<br> so it's an even bet.<br> - Five dollars?<br> - Five dollars is right.<br> I'll be around for the money<br> the day you get back.<br> - Be around with the money, you mean.<br> - You'll see. You'll see.<br> Yeah, I'll see.<br> Well, well, what's this?<br> You got your chains on.<br> You expecting a shower?<br> Nope. I'm expecting good weather.<br> That's why I put my chains on,<br> so I wouldn't be fooled.<br> Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel<br> Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"?<br> Melissa Frake, I guess. With<br> your father entering Blue Boy,<br> the judges might get us mixed.<br> Hog cholera, pneumonia.<br> He left out earthquakes,<br> the old gloom spreader.<br> Poor Dad.<br> Mmm, I don't know.<br> Let me taste.<br> - Don't taste like Grandma Stidger's.<br> - I followed her recipe.<br> - I'll get it.<br> - You left something out.<br> Abel Frake, I am not gonna<br> put liquor into my cooking!<br> Making mincemeat without brandy?<br> No such thing.<br> I don't approve of it,<br> and I won't do it.<br> Well, you'll be sorry. You know,<br> those judges at the fair,<br> they like a little snifter<br> now and then.<br> - It's Eleanor, for Wayne.<br> - Wayne's out back somewhere.<br> I'll find him.<br> Why don't you say hello<br> to Eleanor, Ma?<br> See how her mother is. You know, they<br> had the doctor again this morning.<br> - I suppose I should.<br> - Find out if she's going to the fair.<br> Yes, I will.<br> Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear?<br> How's your mother feeling?<br> Yes, I know. I'm sorry I couldn't<br> get by to see her today,<br> but I've been so busy getting<br> ready to leave and all.<br> Oh, well, I'm glad<br> she's better, dear.<br> Wayne'll be here any moment.<br> Just hold on.<br> And be sure to give<br> my love to your mother.<br> Thank you, dear. Good-bye.<br> - Abel?<br> - Hmm?<br> I need a good-sized box, or cotton.<br> Something to carry my pickles in.<br> Know just what you want, Ma.<br> I'll get it for you right away.<br> "Stir in apples and molasses,<br> spices, lemons..."<br> "Two parts good brandy."<br> No, I won't!<br> - Eph, where's Wayne?<br> - Wayne? He's back there in the barn.<br> Thank you, mister.<br> And now, I think I'll have a<br> try at that fancy brass clock.<br> Yes, that one.<br> - There ya are.<br> - Wayne?<br> There's a nice string of pearls.<br> I think I'll have a go at them.<br> - Oh, I know they're fakes, but...<br> - Wayne!<br> What are you doing?<br> - How long you been there?<br> - Just a little while.<br> Why didn't you say somethin'<br> instead of just standing there?<br> Who were you talking to?<br> And does Mother know you have<br> her embroidery hoops out here?<br> Look, just leave me alone, will ya?<br> And stop prying in other people's affairs.<br> Speaking of affairs,<br> Eleanor's on the phone.<br> Eleanor? Well, Christmas!<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Eleanor's on the phone.<br> Hello, Eleanor? Hi, honey. What'd the<br> doctor say about your mother? Can you go?<br> Well, I don't know<br> what to do, Wayne.<br> The doctor said she's<br> a little better, but...<br> Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go!<br> I've made a lot<br> of plans for us. What?<br> I keep wishing<br> I were somewhere else<br> Walking down a strange, new street<br> Hearing words<br> that I have never heard<br> From a man<br> I've yet to meet<br> He would be a kind<br> of handsome combination<br> Of Ronald Colman Charles Boyer<br> And Bing<br> Margy. My dear, little Margy.<br> I'd make the world a ruby for<br> your little finger and say,<br> "I love you.<br> I love you. I love you."<br> Ah, Margy. You are beautiful.<br> You are so very beautiful.<br> And we feel so gay<br> In a melancholy way<br> That it might as well be spring<br> Margy!<br> - Hello, Margy.<br> - Hello, Harry.<br> No, I'm not mad.<br> I'm just disappointed.<br> Well, I'll see you when I get back.<br> Good-bye.<br> Gee, I wish I was going to<br> the fair with you tonight.<br> I'd rather be doing that<br> than anything I know.<br> - Oh, would you, Harry?<br> - Well, sure.<br> - Only I can't neglect my cows.<br> - Oh. Of course not.<br> - Say, I saw something today.<br> - What?<br> The sweetest bit of farmland<br> this side of Davenport.<br> I was thinking of puttin' a<br> bid in on it if you like it.<br> - If I like it?<br> - Well, sure.<br> You know I haven't made a plan since I was<br> - Got a house on it?<br> - Yeah, but it's too old.<br> - We'd have to build a new one.<br> - Oh, I like old houses.<br> It wouldn't fit in<br> with our kind of farm.<br> You know, I plan to do everything my<br> old man won't let me do on his place.<br> Scientific irrigation, electric<br> milking, separate hen roosts.<br> No horses. All tractor power.<br> - You see what I mean? Everything modern.<br> - But the house you live in...<br> It's gotta be the same. No<br> clapboard and shingle business.<br> There's a new kind of<br> plastic, prefabricated job.<br> I want you to see it.<br> Got the catalog at home.<br> - Is it pretty?<br> - Sure!<br> But what's more important,<br> it's termite-proof.<br> Wait till you see it. And they<br> tell you how to furnish it too.<br> No rugs or carpets.<br> They're just dust collectors.<br> - What's on the floor?<br> - Linoleum through the whole house.<br> Wait till you see the pictures. It's slick<br> and smooth and easy to keep clean.<br> Well, it's like every room<br> in the house was a bathroom.<br> - Sounds real cozy.<br> - Yeah, don't it, though?<br> - What I've always wanted.<br> - Oh, sure. It's the only way to live.<br> - Everything's sanitary.<br> - Sure.<br> - And if we had children...<br> - Oh, Margy!<br> I said if by any strange<br> chance we had children,<br> why, I could dress them<br> in cellophane rompers.<br> Say, I didn't know they had...<br> Life will just be ducky...<br> In our air-conditioned<br> patent-leather farmhouse<br> Plastic.<br> On our ultramodern scientific farm<br> We'll live in a streamlined heaven<br> And we'll waste no time on charm<br> No geraniums to clutter our veranda<br> Nor a single, little<br> sentimental thing<br> No Virginia creepers<br> Nothing useless<br> - What's the matter, honey?<br> - Oh, nothing.<br> Just restless, I guess.<br> Sure. I understand.<br> You like to travel.<br> Well, I figured we'd make a little<br> trip, California or Bermuda or...<br> if it was May, we could go to<br> Washington, see the cherry trees.<br> - A honeymoon?<br> - That's what.<br> I'd almost marry you<br> to make the trip, Harry.<br> No kiddin' now, Margy. What do<br> you say? What do you say?<br> Well, I won't say anything<br> just now, Harry.<br> - Well, after the fair, maybe?<br> - Maybe.<br> Wow!<br> Look at him, Marge!<br> Holy cow! Gets bigger<br> every time I see him.<br> Biggest boar in the world, I bet.<br> All depends on how you spell it.<br> Eleanor can't go.<br> - Where's your mincemeat, Ma?<br> - Right here between my feet.<br> - Is the top on tight?<br> - Certainly, it's on tight.<br> - Why?<br> - Oh, nothin'.<br> Just don't want the flavor<br> to escape, that's all.<br> - Hello, Miss Frake!<br> - Hello, there!<br> - How are you?<br> - Just fine.<br> We'll come see you as<br> soon as we get settled.<br> Yes, do that.<br> If Wayne doesn't come back soon to<br> take me around, I'm going by myself.<br> I do wish your father<br> would come to his breakfast.<br> If he'd rather stay with Blue<br> Boy than eat, well, let him.<br> But I've got<br> my whole day planned out.<br> Don't you know you can't<br> plan out a whole day?<br> - There's no such thing.<br> - I do it all the time.<br> You sound just like Harry. He thinks<br> you can plan out your whole life.<br> So you can.<br> Is that what he was<br> talking about yesterday?<br> Uh-huh.<br> Did you come to anything definite?<br> Uh-uh.<br> I don't know<br> what you're waiting for.<br> It would serve you right if Harry up and<br> married that Skidmore girl instead of you.<br> I almost hope he does.<br> Me too.<br> Step right up, ladies<br> and gentlemen.<br> Move in a little closer.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Hurry, hurry! Play the game!<br> Three rings for a dime.<br> Prizes worth up to $20.<br> Positively no blanks. The prize<br> you win is the prize you get,<br> the prize you take away.<br> Don't any gentleman<br> want to try his skill?<br> Ain't nobody here<br> got the pioneer spirit?<br> I tell you what I'm going to do.<br> I'm goin' to put down three nice,<br> new, crisp one-dollar bills.<br> One here, one here, and one here.<br> Now, who will spend a dime<br> for three chances at $3.00?<br> Is that real money?<br> If you win 'em and you<br> don't like 'em, buddy,<br> I'll give you<br> a dollar apiece for 'em.<br> Hey, mister,<br> them hoops look mighty small.<br> - Do they fit over those things?<br> - Lots of people do it, sir.<br> - Lots of people do it.<br> - Yeah, I did it last year.<br> Remember me? I won a<br> pearl-handled revolver.<br> Well, now, there. You see?<br> Young Mr. Daniel Boone here<br> won a revolver off me<br> right at this very fair a year ago.<br> Bring down any grizzly bears<br> with that shootin' iron, sonny?<br> Tell you what I'll do with you.<br> I'll just give you three rings on<br> the house to start things off.<br> Three chances for nothing.<br> I can't win. I can only lose.<br> But I love the game.<br> Remember, young man, you're<br> enjoying the courtesy of the house.<br> Don't cost us money.<br> I just lost $2.00!<br> But I'm having fun.<br> I love the game.<br> Here, my boy. I want you<br> to have a fair shake.<br> That ring looks warped.<br> Try this one.<br> This one's all right.<br> Well, well, you all see<br> how easy it is.<br> - Who else wants to try?<br> - I'll try again. Here's a dime.<br> - Who else wants a chance at a big prize?<br> - Here, mister, here's my dime.<br> How about you, sir? You look<br> like you've got a good aim.<br> - Why, you got a customer.<br> - Give me three rings. Here's my dime.<br> He's trying to dodge the boy!<br> - All right, buddy. Here ya are.<br> - You didn't put any dollar bills back.<br> Ain't pearl necklaces and safety<br> razors good enough for ya?<br> Can't you enjoy the game<br> for the game's sake?<br> Are ya money mad?<br> Those prizes are all fakes, but I'll<br> win 'em anyway just to prove it.<br> Quite a character.<br> Step up, folks.<br> We're havin' fun here.<br> Just lost a pearl necklace,<br> but I'm laughing.<br> I love the game.<br> Why, the young man<br> is winnin' a fortune.<br> - Here you are, buddy.<br> - Look, pot metal molded in one piece.<br> What good's a vanity case<br> it won't even open?<br> Okay, fella, you had your fun.<br> Now, come on. Move along.<br> And those clocks,<br> they don't have any works.<br> What good are they?<br> Listen, kid, you know what<br> I'm payin' for this pitch?<br> - No. What?<br> - More dough than you'll ever see.<br> So you spend a dime,<br> take $3.00 in cash<br> and then try to tell the<br> public my prizes are no good!<br> Well, they aren't.<br> They're just a lot of junk.<br> Look, you, I've been nice<br> just long enough.<br> - Now, beat it, or I'll call a policeman.<br> - Why don't you?<br> - What's that?<br> - I said, why don't you call a policeman?<br> He's only trying to bluff you.<br> The law says<br> he's got to sell you<br> all the rings you want.<br> - Otherwise, you can close up his place.<br> - Oh, a smart dame, huh?<br> A law student. Now, you listen<br> to me, Arsenic and Glamour,<br> - I don't know who you are...<br> - I'll tell you who I am.<br> My father's the chief<br> of police here.<br> - Your father is...<br> - The chief of police.<br> I was standing here<br> and saw the whole thing.<br> Say, how did you<br> get so good at this?<br> It's kind of a silly thing to be good at,<br> isn't it? But he made me sore last year.<br> I was trying for one of those<br> pearl-handled revolvers.<br> It cost me about $8.00. When I finally<br> did win it, it wasn't a revolver at all.<br> - It wouldn't even shoot. It was just a toy.<br> - Oh, ho!<br> - Defrauding the public, huh?<br> - Now, look, wait a minute.<br> I wouldn't have minded that so much,<br> but he kidded me in front of the crowd.<br> - So I...<br> - You practiced all year just to get even?<br> That's right. I figured I'd come back<br> and make as big a fool out of him<br> - as he made out of me.<br> - Oh, no, you don't.<br> Will you give him $8.00 back<br> if he promises to lay off?<br> - Look, you, I don't care who your father is.<br> - Okay.<br> Here. Here, here.<br> Here's your eight bucks,<br> and you don't come back, see?<br> - Is it a deal?<br> - Think it's all right to take it?<br> Well, sure, it's all right.<br> Here you are. Good-bye.<br> Good-bye!<br> Oh, don't leave, folks.<br> Prizes up to $20.<br> - Ah!<br> - Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!<br> We're having fun here!<br> Gee, it was swell of you to stand<br> up for me like that. Thanks.<br> Well, that's all right.<br> He had it coming to him.<br> Well, uh, now that you helped<br> me get my money back,<br> how about helping me spend it?<br> - No, that won't be necessary.<br> - What about a frozen custard?<br> - No, thank you. I believe not.<br> - Hot dog?<br> No. Really, I have an appointment.<br> I'm late already.<br> Won't I see you again? How about tonight?<br> Will you be on the midway?<br> Tonight? Yes, I think so.<br> I hope so.<br> I'll sure be looking for you.<br> - Do that. Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> You sure you won't change your mind?<br> How about some popcorn?<br> Get tickets now if<br> you care to ride.<br> Train's now ready to leave.<br> Get your tickets for this ride.<br> All aboard if you care to ride.<br> - The train is now...<br> - One, please.<br> Please get tickets for this ride.<br> It's the longest,<br> the highest, the fastest,<br> the safest ride at the fairground.<br> Get tickets now if<br> you care to ride.<br> Hey, Pappy, there aren't<br> any seats together.<br> Oh. Say, mister, do you mind<br> sitting in the seat behind?<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Thanks.<br> - All aboard!<br> - Okay. There they go! Hold your seats.<br> They're off on a race through<br> the clouds. A thrill a minute!<br> Sit down!<br> What are you trying to do,<br> get yourself killed?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Haven't you ever been on one<br> of these things before?<br> Not since I was a little girl.<br> - I used to be afraid of them.<br> - But you're not now.<br> That's what I wanted to find out.<br> Here comes another dip.<br> It's nearly over now.<br> Here's the tunnel.<br> Johnny, stop that!<br> Everybody out, folks.<br> Everybody out.<br> - I'm going around again.<br> - You gotta have a ticket.<br> - Press pass.<br> - Oh.<br> - Is the lady going around again too?<br> - No, thanks. I've had enough.<br> The safest ride at the fair.<br> Get tickets now for this ride.<br> Go and get tickets for this ride.<br> It is the longest,<br> fastest thrill ride<br> at the fairgrounds.<br> Get tickets now<br> if you care to ride.<br> Three rings for a dime. Hurry.<br> - You feel safer down here?<br> - Oh!<br> - I thought you were...<br> - I changed my mind.<br> I was standing there<br> watching you walk away.<br> Every step you took, your hair bounced<br> up and down on the back of your neck.<br> It was really nice. I don't know if<br> that's what got me, but here I am.<br> Now it's your turn<br> to say something.<br> What can I say? I don't know you.<br> - I can arrange that.<br> - And all you know about me<br> is that my hair bounces<br> up and down when I walk.<br> - Everybody's hair bounces up and down.<br> - Mine doesn't.<br> I mean, girls.<br> Well, look over there.<br> Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe<br> it was the way you held your shoulders.<br> - Walk away again. Let me see.<br> - All right.<br> Hey! Hey, wait a minute!<br> - Where are you going?<br> - You told me to walk away.<br> - Yeah, but I...<br> - Really, I have to go anyway.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, I...<br> Well, what? What are you afraid of?<br> - I'm not afraid of anything.<br> - Good.<br> Then what would be wrong with you<br> and me sitting down over there<br> and exchanging our ideas<br> of life over a Coke?<br> Nothing wrong. It's just that...<br> I'm not saying it's a great idea.<br> I'm just asking what's bad about it.<br> What could we lose? Let's give it<br> five minutes. What do you say?<br> Here we are, two people who<br> know nothing about each other.<br> Maybe we should. Maybe it would be<br> fun to find out what we're like.<br> - Maybe it'll be dull.<br> - What do we do if it's dull?<br> - We break it up.<br> - How do we do that?<br> One of us just says, "Let's<br> break it up." That's the end.<br> You go east, I go west. No hard<br> feelings. No questions asked.<br> - Ag reed?<br> - Ag reed.<br> Okay. Here we go.<br> Hold on! Here we go!<br> Hearing words<br> that I have never heard<br> From a man I've yet to meet<br> Now, with rolly coasters,<br> that's different. They're fun.<br> You oughta see the one in New York.<br> There's one in Chicago<br> that's pretty good.<br> There's one out at<br> the beach in Los Angeles.<br> It's not bad, but the one in New York,<br> the one across the river, that's the one.<br> - It's got a dip of 200 feet.<br> - You've been everywhere, haven't you?<br> Not yet. When I first<br> started out in this game,<br> I worked around<br> on different papers.<br> But now, I'm afraid the great Des<br> Moines Register's got me hog-tied.<br> Someday, I'll work on<br> a bigger paper though.<br> I'm sure you will.<br> Well, I think I'd better go<br> the rest of the way alone.<br> I'd have a pretty hard time<br> explaining you to my folks.<br> Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody<br> has a hard time explaining me.<br> - See you again?<br> - Well, I...<br> Or would you like to say,<br> "Let's break it up"?<br> Oh, no! Well, I mean, do you?<br> Look, bobbylocks,<br> don't worry about me.<br> Anytime I wanna throw in the<br> sponge, you'll know it.<br> I just won't be around.<br> Well, I don't know what the<br> family's plans are for tonight.<br> - I don't know where I'll be.<br> - I'll find you.<br> - How?<br> - I'm a newspaperman.<br> It's my job to find the right<br> people at the right time.<br> You'll be seeing me. So long.<br> So long.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What's the trouble, Blue Boy?<br> Ain't you feelin' good?<br> This ain't like you, son.<br> - Ain't sick, is he?<br> - Huh?<br> Sick? Oh, no, no.<br> He's in fine shape.<br> Just had a long trip. Kind of<br> resting up a bit, that's all.<br> Oh. I thought he was sick.<br> Oh, no. He's never<br> felt better in his life.<br> You see what a spectacle<br> you made of yourself?<br> What are people<br> gonna say about you?<br> - Hello, Hank.<br> - Hello, there.<br> - What you got this year?<br> - Never you mind.<br> She'll put anything you've got<br> in the shade. You wait and see.<br> - Come on. Get along, there. Get along.<br> - Hello, Hank.<br> Hello, there, Frake. How are ya?<br> Ah. You got a duroc this time, huh?<br> - And a good one too. Get in there.<br> - She's got nice color.<br> Well, she oughta have.<br> Her mother before her<br> was the most beautiful red<br> sow in the whole world.<br> - What's her name?<br> - Esmeralda.<br> And she'll win the<br> sweepstakes sure.<br> Now you look like something.<br> I don't mind telling you, though,<br> you had me worried, son,<br> but I knew you'd come through.<br> Now you look like a real champion.<br> - Oh! Excuse me.<br> - Oh!<br> Why don't you look where you're goin'?<br> Gawking around like that,<br> people'll think you've never<br> been to a fair before.<br> I just thought we might meet<br> somebody we know.<br> - So what?<br> - Well, why are you looking around?<br> Who are you looking for?<br> I sort of had a half date, with<br> a guy I met here last year.<br> - Why don't you keep it?<br> - What would I do with you?<br> - Well, look, Wayne...<br> - I beg your pardon, sir.<br> - May I trouble you for a match?<br> - Sure.<br> - I think I have some right here.<br> - That's very kind of you.<br> Okay.<br> - Here you are. Thanks.<br> - Why don't you keep them?<br> - My brother has another pack.<br> - Sure, sure. Go ahead.<br> - That's okay.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - You're certainly big with my matches.<br> - What do you care?<br> Your pockets are always<br> full of them.<br> Look, Wayne, if you really wanna keep your<br> date with that friend, I wouldn't mind.<br> - You wouldn't?<br> - No.<br> I hardly slept a wink<br> in that old truck last night.<br> What I really wanted to do<br> tonight was to go to bed early<br> but I didn't wanna disappoint you.<br> Oh, don't worry about me.<br> Uh, maybe you'd better.<br> You do look a little tired.<br> - And I can get back all right.<br> - Ah, that's swell, sis.<br> Thanks. I mean, get<br> a good rest now.<br> I will.<br> Hello.<br> Take home a beautiful<br> pennant from the state fair.<br> Come right over. Help yourself.<br> Oh, pardon me. I'm looking for<br> the chief of police's daughter.<br> - Have you seen her around here anyplace?<br> - His daughter?<br> I don't believe I know her.<br> There's the chief over there.<br> Why don't you ask him?<br> Okay. Thank you.<br> - Good evening, Chief.<br> - Good evening, son. What can I do for you?<br> Could you tell me where<br> your daughter is?<br> I sort of had a date<br> to meet her here tonight.<br> - What?<br> - Well, it wasn't exactly a date.<br> She said... I mean, I told her...<br> Well, let's see.<br> She's around here somewhere.<br> Oh, Violet?<br> Yes, Daddy?<br> This young gentleman tells me you two<br> have a date to go out stepping tonight.<br> Huh?<br> Well, I guess I must<br> mean her sister.<br> I haven't got a sister.<br> Looks like someone's been<br> pulling your leg, my boy.<br> Yeah. That's a pretty good<br> joke on me, all right.<br> Well, thanks.<br> How many, please?<br> - Huh?<br> - How many tickets?<br> Oh. One.<br> And now for your favorite,<br> the lovely Emily Edwards,<br> and That's For Me.<br> Right<br> Between the eyes<br> Quite a belt<br> That blow I felt this morning<br> Fate<br> Gave me no warning<br> Great<br> Was my surprise<br> I saw you standing in the sun<br> And you were something to see<br> I know what I like<br> and I liked what I saw<br> And I said to myself that's for me<br> A lovely morning I remarked<br> And you were quick to agree<br> You wanted to walk<br> and I nodded my head<br> As I breathlessly said<br> That's for me<br> I left you standing under stars<br> The day's adventures are through<br> There's nothing for me<br> but the dream in my heart<br> And the dream in my heart<br> That's for you<br> Oh, my darling<br> That's for you<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Who's that singing?<br> - That's Emily Edwards.<br> She's kind of cute,<br> but she's not my type.<br> She's a redhead.<br> Now, with brown hair,<br> that's different.<br> - Hello, Pat.<br> - Hi, Pat.<br> - Hi, girls.<br> - How are you doin', honey?<br> - Quiet, you.<br> - I guess you know a lot of girls, don't you?<br> Well, in my racket, you know...<br> For you<br> - I, uh, just spoke to your father.<br> - My who?<br> Your father. You know,<br> the chief of police.<br> Oh, that. Didn't you know<br> I was kidding?<br> Well, I do now.<br> And just for that, you're gonna<br> have to have a drink with me.<br> When I first saw you up there,<br> I couldn't believe you were the same girl.<br> Why not? Was I that bad?<br> I didn't mean it that way.<br> You were good, wonderful.<br> That's just it. A girl singer like<br> you with Tommy Thomas's band,<br> I couldn't figure out why you went<br> to all that trouble today just for me.<br> - Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with you?<br> - Oh, nothing wrong with me.<br> I mean, well, maybe there is,<br> but don't tell me.<br> - Like to dance?<br> - Uh-huh. Do you?<br> Sure. That's why<br> I brought it up. Sure.<br> - We can get our drinks later.<br> - All right.<br> The big feature ride of the fair.<br> Get your tickets for the next ride.<br> This is the highest, fastest,<br> safest ride at the fairgrounds.<br> Get tickets now<br> for the big, fast ride.<br> - Come on. I dare you.<br> - I'm game.<br> - How many?<br> - Two, please.<br> - What you thinking about?<br> - Why?<br> Oh, you sort of had<br> a funny smile on your face.<br> - You really want to know?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Well, I was just thinking about<br> you practicing all that time<br> with your mother's embroidery hoops<br> just to get even with somebody.<br> I guess you think I'm kind<br> of screwy, don't you?<br> No, I don't. I don't at all.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I like that kind of a fellow.<br> That's lucky for me, because<br> I like the kind of a girl<br> who likes that kind of fellow.<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The moon is flying high<br> And somewhere a bird<br> who is bound he'll be heard<br> ls throwing his heart at the sky<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The stars are bright above<br> The earth is aglow<br> and to add to the show<br> I think I am falling in love<br> Falling<br> Falling in love<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The stars are bright above<br> The earth is aglow<br> and to add to the show<br> I think I am falling in love<br> Falling<br> Falling in love<br> Maybe it's more than the moon<br> Maybe it's more than the birds<br> Maybe it's more<br> than the sight of the night<br> In a light too lovely for words<br> Maybe it's more than the earth<br> Shiny in silvery blue<br> Maybe the reason<br> I'm feeling this way<br> Has something to do with you<br> Say, you're pretty good in that<br> voice department yourself.<br> I'm an old glee club boy.<br> The moon is flying high<br> And somewhere a bird<br> who is bound he'll be heard<br> ls throwing his heart at the sky<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The stars are bright above<br> The earth is aglow<br> and to add to the show<br> I think I am falling in love<br> Falling<br> Falling in love<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The moon is flying high<br> And somewhere a bird<br> who is bound he'll be heard<br> Is throwing his heart at the sky<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The stars are bright above<br> The earth is aglow<br> and to add to the show<br> I think I am falling in love<br> Falling<br> Falling in love<br> And you were something to see<br> I know what I like<br> and I liked what I saw<br> And I said to myself that's for me<br> A lovely morning I remarked<br> And you were quick to agree<br> You wanted to walk<br> and I nodded my head<br> As I breathlessly said<br> That's for me<br> I left you standing under stars<br> - The day's adventures are through<br> - Ow!<br> There's nothing for me<br> but the dream in my heart<br> And the dream in my heart that's<br> For you<br> Oh, my darling<br> That's<br> For you<br> Hey, cut that out!<br> I'll get you for that. You wait<br> and see now. You just wait.<br> You two sound like you had<br> a wonderful time last night.<br> - Sure did.<br> - Mmm, terrific.<br> Wish your father was enjoying himself<br> instead of brooding over that old pig.<br> Say, I thought you were going<br> to bed early last night.<br> Oh. Well, I was going to,<br> but I changed my mind.<br> I went for a ride<br> on the roller coaster.<br> - It's much better than it was last year.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> I tell you, he's raring to go.<br> When I left him just now, he was<br> strutting around prouder than a peacock.<br> - You'd think he owned the place.<br> - Thank goodness.<br> Maybe now you'll<br> give me a little time.<br> Yes, sir, he's all right.<br> Wait till you see him.<br> There ain't a hog ever was or<br> ever will be that can touch him.<br> For what we're about to receive,<br> O Lord, make us duly thankful. Amen.<br> - You said grace before, Daddy.<br> - Yeah.<br> I did? Well, I'm going to<br> keep on saying it all day.<br> I just hope he stays like he<br> is till the judges see him!<br> Why, they hardly tasted them!<br> And I like my sweet pickles best.<br> They don't have to taste much.<br> They're experts.<br> Don't be so jittery, Mother.<br> - There's that Mrs. Metcalfe.<br> - Hmm?<br> - Behind the lady in the red hat.<br> - Oh, yes, I see her.<br> So biggety. Why, she was<br> just lucky last year.<br> Her pies weren't<br> half as good as yours.<br> - Why, hello, Mrs. Metcalfe. Pardon me.<br> - Hello.<br> Going to win all the<br> prizes again this year?<br> I don't know about all, but I have high<br> hopes for my pickles and mincemeat.<br> Same as you.<br> Look. They like your sour pickles.<br> This is the last year I'm<br> ever gonna enter anything.<br> - It isn't worth it.<br> - Oh, Mother, you say that every year.<br> Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, aren't they going<br> to announce their decision?<br> Not until they finish<br> with the mincemeat.<br> Thank you.<br> I don't remember telling you to<br> cover this part of the fair.<br> Hello, boss.<br> Thought you were specializing in human<br> interest stories on the midway.<br> What's wrong with putting in a plug<br> for the housewives of our state?<br> That, my friend, is Mrs. America.<br> Do tell. And what dainty<br> putter-upper<br> of what delicious preserve is the<br> cause of your presence here?<br> Look, forget you're the managing editor of<br> a newspaper and try to act intelligent.<br> Have you ever seen me with<br> the type who's a good cook?<br> No, but I've seen you<br> with every other kind.<br> You had to get around<br> to these sometime.<br> Shove off. Let me finish this<br> story. It's for your paper.<br> Sure. Only I hope it's better than<br> the one you turned in last night,<br> "Fun on a Roller Coaster." Ouch.<br> Boy, you'd better hope<br> the old man misses that one<br> or he'll never give you a<br> shot at that job in Chicago.<br> That's yours, isn't it?<br> Mmm.<br> Do you think they liked it?<br> They must have. They<br> certainly ate enough.<br> Your attention, please.<br> Silence, please.<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> Quiet, please!<br> We are now ready to announce<br> the awards. Sweet pickles.<br> First prize to Mrs. Edwin<br> Metcalfe of Pottsville.<br> Second prize to...<br> To Mrs. Agnes Field<br> of Arcadia.<br> Sour pickles.<br> First prize to<br> Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.<br> Oh, Mother.<br> Second prize to<br> Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe.<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen...<br> Quiet, please. As you know,<br> we occasionally give a plaque<br> for distinguished achievement.<br> As you are doubtlessly aware,<br> this plaque is only given<br> in rare cases.<br> And on this occasion,<br> my colleagues and I<br> have voted unanimously<br> that it be given to a lady who has<br> concocted the most delicious,<br> the most succulent<br> and spiciest mincemeat<br> ever entered in a state fair.<br> The lady who wins this distinction<br> is none other than Mrs.<br> Melissa Frake of Brunswick.<br> - Oh, Mother! Oh!<br> - Congratulations. I'm so glad.<br> I've got the most a woman<br> can get in life, Margy.<br> - If I think any more about it, I'll cry.<br> - Stand where you are, please.<br> Hold it. Thank you.<br> Thank you very much, ladies.<br> Your picture will appear in the<br> Register tomorrow morning.<br> Good day.<br> - See, Mother? You're famous.<br> - I'm worn out.<br> I'm going up to the trailer<br> and lie down.<br> I never knew what a strain it was<br> to get something you really wanted.<br> - I'll take these, dear.<br> - Oh, my hat too.<br> Now you run along<br> and enjoy yourself.<br> My horse is number 8,<br> Tessie In the green shirt.<br> Come on, Tessie! Come on!<br> Get up there. Come on!<br> Attagirl, Tessie.<br> Pass her! Pass her!<br> Attagirl, Tess!<br> Oh, she made it!<br> She won! She won!<br> Oh, Pat, your horse won!<br> it can't be much fun for you<br> just hanging around waiting<br> to catch me between songs.<br> Can't think of anything<br> I'd rather be doing.<br> Anyway, we can... I mean, can<br> we go someplace after the show?<br> I thought maybe we'd have<br> something to eat or something.<br> Well, I can't tonight, Wayne.<br> - It's Marty's birthday.<br> - Who's Marty?<br> The boy I sing with in the band. We're<br> giving a surprise party for him.<br> Wouldn't you like to come?<br> I was kind of counting<br> on being alone with you.<br> I know. I'd like that better too.<br> But this is a party<br> we cooked up a week ago.<br> We're giving it in my rooms<br> at the hotel<br> - so I can't very well back out now.<br> - Hey, Emily.<br> - They're playing the introduction.<br> - All right, Marty.<br> Now don't go away.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> Listen, kids, I got<br> the greatest number here...<br> McGee, if you ever scare me<br> like that again...<br> I got the greatest number I ever plugged,<br> and I'm gonna give you first crack at it.<br> Buzz off, McGee. We're busy.<br> Eh, just like all singers,<br> they don't like songs.<br> - Hi, buddy.<br> - Hello.<br> - You in the music business?<br> - No. I'm a farmer.<br> A farmer. What a night I'm having.<br> Well, uh, you're a friend<br> of Emily's, ain't ya?<br> That's right.<br> - My name's McGee.<br> - My name's Wayne Frake.<br> - You in the music business?<br> - Yeah, I'm a song plugger.<br> - I work on songs till they get popular.<br> - How do you mean work on 'em?<br> I thought songs got popular<br> because people like 'em.<br> That's naive. How can people like<br> a song if they don't hear it?<br> You got to get the big<br> singers to sing it first.<br> How do you do that?<br> There's all kinds of ways,<br> and none of them is easy.<br> You got no idea what a snook like me has<br> to do to get a song on the hit parade.<br> Last week I fell down in<br> front of Dinah Shore's taxi<br> just to get in<br> conversation with her.<br> Every Christmas, I got to remember<br> to send Sinatra a new bow tie.<br> When a bandleader's<br> wife has a baby,<br> I gotta stay home with it<br> on the nurse's night out.<br> It's a big question whether Mairzy<br> Doats would have been a hit<br> if I hadn't had known<br> how to change a "didey."<br> - Is that a new song you got there?<br> - Yeah, and it's a honey.<br> A natural for your friend Emily.<br> You wouldn't wanna help me<br> get it to her, would ya?<br> I am not at all niggardly<br> when it comes to payola.<br> - Payola?<br> - Ah, it's a technical term. Forget it.<br> The man who wrote this song is<br> starving in an attic in Brooklyn.<br> His wife ran out on him,<br> left him penniless with two kids.<br> She even took the piano with her<br> so now he can't write no more.<br> If this song ain't a hit, there's<br> only one thing left for this man,<br> the river.<br> On the other hand, if somebody was to<br> get a great artist like Emily Edwards<br> to introduce it with<br> a band on the radio,<br> this man's fortune would be made and<br> his genius preserved for posterity.<br> How do you know he ain't<br> another Stephen Foster?<br> - I don't. Only...<br> - Just read those words.<br> Here. Take a couple of copies. I'll hum<br> the tune so you can see how they fit.<br> Follow me.<br> Right there.<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The stars are bright above<br> The earth is aglow<br> and to add to the show<br> I think I am falling in love<br> Falling<br> Falling in love<br> Maybe it's more than the moon<br> Maybe it's more than the birds<br> Maybe it's more<br> than the sight of the night<br> In a light too lovely for words<br> Maybe it's more than the earth<br> Shiny in silvery blue<br> Maybe the reason<br> I'm feeling this way<br> Has something to do with you<br> It's a grand night for singing<br> The stars are bright above<br> The earth is aglow<br> and to add to the show<br> I think I am falling in love<br> Falling<br> Falling in love<br> La, la, la, la, la, la<br> - Hey, where's my drink?<br> - Let's see what else we've got here.<br> Look, Wayne, how about<br> your singing a chorus?<br> No, thanks. You're doing<br> all right without me.<br> - But I want them to hear you.<br> - You can't be as good as she says.<br> - You'd be surprised. Come on.<br> - No, really.<br> Come on. Don't tell me<br> we have to coax you.<br> How about singing one<br> of those corn-fed ditties<br> you guys sing around<br> these little towns?<br> - Come on, Wayne. Sing anything you like.<br> - Yeah, you can't tell.<br> You might have something<br> we can use with the band.<br> As a matter of fact, if you need a new song,<br> I've got one right here I like very much.<br> He didn't expect to sing, but<br> he brought his music with him.<br> - Would you like to try it with me?<br> - You do it yourself.<br> - Did you write it?<br> - No, I didn't. A fellow gave it to me.<br> - Okay, bud.<br> - Okay, bud.<br> This ought to be something.<br> Maybe you'll never be<br> the love of my life<br> Maybe I'm not the boy<br> of your dreams<br> But isn't it kind of fun<br> to look in each other's eyes<br> Swapping romantic gleams<br> Maybe you're not a girl<br> to have and to hold<br> Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay<br> But isn't it kind of fun<br> carousing around the town<br> Dancing the night away<br> Isn't it kind of fun holding hands<br> According to a sweet<br> and corny custom<br> Isn't it kind of fun making vows<br> Admitting that we both<br> intend to bust 'em<br> Maybe we're out for laughs<br> A girl and a boy<br> Kidding across a table for two<br> But haven't you got a hunch<br> that this is the real McCoy<br> And all the things<br> we tell each other<br> Are true<br> I'm not a girl<br> for sentimental tripe<br> I never go for the Romeo type<br> Over a dewy-eyed Juliet<br> No one has seen me drool yet<br> I don't say our hearts are tied<br> By love's eternal tether<br> But using words less dignified<br> Isn't it kind of fun to be together<br> Maybe you'll never be<br> the love of my life<br> Maybe I'm not the girl<br> of your dreams<br> But isn't it kind of fun<br> to look in each other's eyes<br> Swapping romantic gleams<br> Maybe I'm not a girl<br> to have and to hold<br> Well, maybe I'm not<br> a boy who would stay<br> But isn't it kind of fun<br> carousing around the town<br> Dancing the night away<br> Oh, isn't it kind<br> of fun holding hands<br> According to a sweet<br> and corny custom<br> Isn't it kind of fun making vows<br> Admitting that we both<br> intend to bust 'em<br> Maybe we're out for laughs<br> A girl and a boy<br> Kidding across a table for two<br> - But haven't you got a hunch<br> - That this is the real McCoy<br> And all the things<br> we tell each other<br> Are true<br> - Wonderful.<br> - That was great.<br> You know, you're right about<br> that song, Wayne. I like it too.<br> - You do?<br> - "Billings Publishing Company," huh?<br> - A guy named McGee give you this?<br> - That's right.<br> How much did he slip you<br> for plugging it tonight?<br> Wait a minute, Marty!<br> He didn't slip me anything.<br> Didn't he promise to come<br> through with the old payola?<br> - He used that expression.<br> - I'll bet he did. That's great, Emily.<br> Your boyfriend cashing in on you.<br> - How do you like that?<br> - Wayne!<br> Wayne.<br> Wayne, wait a minute.<br> I'm sorry, Emily.<br> I just couldn't help it.<br> He's been putting in digs<br> ever since I got here.<br> I know he was asking for it,<br> but please don't go.<br> You don't think I'd cash in on being<br> friends with you like he said, do you?<br> Of course not. And he wouldn't have<br> said it, only he's had a few drinks.<br> - Please come back.<br> - It just wouldn't work, Emily.<br> I'd let him have it the first<br> time he opened his mouth.<br> Look. Why don't you<br> walk around the block?<br> Give me a chance to get rid<br> of them. How about that?<br> I'd hate to have you<br> break up the party.<br> I'll tell them I have a headache.<br> When you come back, we'll be alone.<br> That's the way<br> you wanted it, isn't it?<br> - Okay. How long?<br> - Come back in half an hour.<br> Emily, I...<br> - Half an hour.<br> - Make it 15 minutes.<br> All right.<br> Only a few stars left.<br> Yeah, and they look kind of tired.<br> Funny how a day creeps on.<br> So slowly at first<br> you think it's never coming.<br> Then all of a sudden,<br> it spreads out over the sky,<br> the sun starts shining.<br> People loom up like that too.<br> Are you really gonna go home and<br> marry that guy you're engaged to?<br> That's what girls usually do, isn't it?<br> Marry the men they're engaged to.<br> Yeah. They're usually<br> sorry afterward.<br> Think you'll every marry?<br> Who, me? Sure. Sometime.<br> Only trouble is, if I ever found<br> a girl I cared that much about,<br> I'd care too much about it to<br> wish a guy like me off on her.<br> - Sounds kind of hopeless.<br> - I guess it is.<br> It's pretty hard for me<br> to picture myself,<br> what do they call it,<br> popping the question.<br> Can you imagine me suddenly turning<br> to some girl and blurting out,<br> "Will you marry me?"<br> No. I can see you wouldn't.<br> Well, bobbylocks, you've<br> made a very wise decision.<br> Anyway, I'd be no good<br> for you, no good at all.<br> Of course, you'd be<br> awfully good for me.<br> Say, what about your old man's hog?<br> Aren't they gonna judge<br> him this afternoon?<br> Oh, yes. I guess<br> I'd better be going.<br> - Wayne's probably in already.<br> - it's getting pretty late.<br> - Don't you want me to go with you?<br> - No. It's better if you don't.<br> - Will I see you tonight?<br> - In front of the roller coaster?<br> Well, I...<br> - Good night, honey.<br> - Good night.<br> - Pat?<br> - Yes?<br> I was only talking. I couldn't<br> marry anybody but you, ever.<br> Well, Blue Boy,<br> this is the great day,<br> your hour of judgment.<br> Now take it easy there now.<br> Don't get your face dirty.<br> Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already<br> won. There's his blue ribbon.<br> Oh, that thing?<br> That's only the class award.<br> That means he's won<br> his class of senior boars.<br> I'm getting him ready now to go<br> in for the grand championship.<br> - Is he all right?<br> - All right? Why, just look at him.<br> He's fit as a fiddle.<br> Class 51, Hampshire senior sows,<br> - pavilion number two.<br> - Better go in now, son.<br> Get seated.<br> We go in right after this.<br> - We'd better get going.<br> - Good luck, Pa.<br> - Thanks, Ma.<br> - You too, Blue Boy.<br> - We'll be pulling for you.<br> - All right. Bye. See you later.<br> Well, let's see.<br> Is your face clean, son?<br> Yes, you're all right.<br> You gotta look your best, you know.<br> You taking her in, Hank?<br> No, not yet.

It's getting late.<br> - Just a minute.<br> Say, you look mighty pretty tonight.<br> Is that a new dress?<br> - Uh-huh. Do you like it?<br> - Prettiest girl I ever saw.<br> Okay, I'm ready.<br> Not too late now. We wanna get<br> an early start in the morning.<br> Might be a little late. It's the<br> last night. So long, Dad.<br> - Bye.<br> - So long.<br> They look nice together,<br> don't they?<br> Hmm? What'd you say?<br> I said we had two lovely children.<br> Who said we didn't?<br> I wish Margy would make<br> up her mind about Harry.<br> Why? He won't run away.<br> He's one of those goody-goody boys.<br> I don't see anything<br> wrong with that.<br> You were a good boy<br> when I fell in love with you.<br> That's what you thought.<br> Well, since you're such a gay dog,<br> you'd better take me to the<br> midway tonight for a little fun.<br> - No, Ma, you're all tired out.<br> - Who said I was tired?<br> Say. Here's something interesting.<br> It's about that judge, the fella<br> that gave you the plaque.<br> It says here how he had a kind of seizure<br> afterwards, delirium tremens sort of.<br> "While Mr. Hippenstahl<br> was unconscious,<br> "he kept murmuring<br> something about mincemeat.<br> "Those nearby declared they could<br> smell brandy on his breath."<br> You fool.<br> Now, just for that,<br> you've got to take me out.<br> Oh, no, Ma.<br> I've got that nice<br> tired-out feeling.<br> - You and I are going to the fair.<br> - I've seen the fair.<br> You've seen the hog pavilion.<br> Are you going<br> to get out of that chair?<br> Now, Ma, I'm up.<br> Now go on in and change<br> your clothes.

I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W-A!<br> Hooray! Ioway! Yea!<br> What do you think of this<br> imitation champagne, Ma?<br> First time I ever tried it,<br> and I love it.<br> It's as good as that<br> French champagne any day.<br> - Did you ever taste French champagne?<br> - No.<br> Who's that little runt?<br> - Hmm?<br> - What's he grinning at?<br> That's Mr. Hippenstahl,<br> the pickle and mincemeat judge.<br> Oh. Oh!<br> Well, that explains it. He's drunk!<br> - Quiet, Pa.<br> - Come on, Ma.<br> - Let's get out on the midway.<br> - All right.<br> Hey, buddy! I wanna thank you for the<br> plug you gave that song last night.<br> It's all set with Tommy Thomas for Emily<br> to sing it in Chicago tomorrow night.<br> - Chicago?<br> - Yeah. That's their next date,<br> the Palmer House.<br> I'm going with them<br> on the plane tonight.<br> Sticking close so they<br> won't change their mind.<br> Emily didn't say she was... I didn't<br> figure on them leaving tonight.<br> Sure, right after the show.<br> I wish she'd hurry up and get<br> out here. I wanna talk to her.<br> Kind of went overboard for<br> each other, didn't you, kid?<br> - Kind of.<br> - She told me.<br> Oh, they all tell me everything.<br> - You going back to the farm soon?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> That'll be good.<br> Come in.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - I was just on my way out.<br> - I'll say you are. Where's your suitcase?<br> - Suitcase? What for?<br> The old man just phoned from Chicago.<br> He's gonna give you a crack at that job.<br> - The Eastern syndicate?<br> - That's right. A column of your own.<br> - I can't believe it.<br> - He's leaving for the coast in the morning<br> and he wants you to fly up to<br> Chicago and talk to him tonight.<br> - That means the 8:30 plane.<br> - How much time have I got?<br> Practically none. I'm holding a taxi<br> downstairs. I'll get your shaving things.<br> - Hey, wait!<br> - What's the matter?<br> I can't leave now. I've got a girl<br> waiting for me out at the fair.<br> - What'll I do?<br> - Do? Get another girl in Chicago.<br> A girl waiting at the fair.<br> I break my neck getting this chance for you<br> and you start yapping about some girl.<br> - This is different. This is not just a girl.<br> - I know. She's wonderful.<br> Only girl in the world. And I<br> suppose this job is just a job.<br> The kind that comes up every day.<br> Look, I wanna make something<br> very clear to you, sonny-boy.<br> The old man is funny.<br> When he wants you someplace,<br> you better, or you're through.<br> - I know that, but...<br> - Do you want this job or don't you?<br> You've got about two minutes<br> to make up your mind.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - What did she say?<br> - She sees a lot of money coming my way.<br> - Good. I can use some.<br> - I don't think it'll do you much good.<br> She says I'm going<br> to marry three times.<br> There they are, folks,<br> the eight fugitives<br> from the Follies.<br> They did a little dance in New York,<br> but the police commissioner objected.<br> He demanded that they take<br> certain things out of the dance.<br> Understand? Well, rather than<br> do the emasculated version,<br> they come out here to give you the<br> original dance with nothing cut out.<br> Just to prove to you what you're<br> gonna see on the inside...<br> Okay, Mike, let her rip!<br> - Do you want to go in?<br> - Huh?<br> It means nothing to me,<br> but if you'd like to see it,<br> I'd be glad to take you in, hmm?<br> Hmm?<br> What do you think?<br> Of course, like I say,<br> it means nothing to me<br> unless you wanna go in.<br> You do? Come on.<br> Two, please.<br> - Enjoying yourself?<br> - Yes, we are.<br> That's good.<br> What's that old buzzard<br> doing, following you around?<br> Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing<br> the fair, having fun, same as we are.<br> All aboard. Train now leaving.<br> Get tickets for this ride.<br> Another train coming in.<br> Get your tickets for that high,<br> fast ride through the sky,<br> on the big roller coaster<br> the big feature ride of the fair.<br> But last night and all the things<br> we said, was that just kidding?<br> No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding.<br> Well, it certainly wasn't with me.<br> I thought that...<br> Oh, what's the difference<br> what I thought?<br> But, Wayne, darling, I thought<br> you understood that...<br> Well, after all, we were just<br> two people who met at a fair...<br> And fell in love, didn't we?<br> Well, that was something<br> I hadn't bargained for.<br> Wayne, will you believe something?<br> Just one thing.<br> It's every bit as hard for me<br> to give you up as it is for...<br> Well, then why do it?<br> Why give each other up?<br> Why don't you come with me,<br> meet my father and mother<br> and go home with us tomorrow?<br> - Because I can't, Wayne. I...<br> - Hey, Emily.<br> - You ready?<br> - No, she isn't!<br> I'll be right in, Marty.<br> Wait here, Wayne.<br> I have to tell you something,<br> something I should have<br> told you before,<br> and I would have, if I<br> hadn't been such a coward.<br> Please, wait, Wayne. Please.<br> You mind if I say something?<br> - Such as what?<br> - First, let me get something straight.<br> When you said that about<br> taking Emily home with you,<br> did you mean the works,<br> a wedding ring and all?<br> That's it, the works. And<br> that's the way it's gonna be.<br> Look, I'll give it to you quick.<br> She's married.<br> She's got a husband, see?<br> He don't work at it very hard.<br> They split up about a year ago.<br> He claims he's a songwriter,<br> but he's just no good at it.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> he's just no good, period.<br> She liked him, though. Sort of<br> knocked her out for a while.<br> Come to think of it, you're the first<br> guy she's looked at since then.<br> I guess I just don't understand<br> the people in your business.<br> Take my word, they're the<br> same as anybody else.<br> They make mistakes, sure,<br> but don't everybody?<br> Are all the people<br> in your town perfect?<br> Why didn't she tell me?<br> She told you why.<br> She didn't want<br> to spoil everything.<br> Maybe she figured she had a right<br> to a little happiness too.<br> You know what you and me<br> need right now?<br> A drink.<br> How about it, buddy?<br> Ring the old pipe!<br> There she goes. 47! He's<br> getting higher and higher!<br> Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake.<br> Not bad, huh? Thank you.<br> But you didn't ring the bell,<br> though. Ho, ho, ho.<br> I know I didn't ring the<br> bell, though. Ho, ho, ho.<br> - Who can? Can you?<br> - I don't know. I never tried.<br> - Why don't you?<br> - I don't know, but I will.<br> Step right up, neighbor.<br> Step right up.<br> - It's kind of heavy, isn't it?<br> - Allow me.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, I suppose the idea is<br> to lean your weight on it.<br> Yes. Put all your 120 pounds in it.<br> Come on, Ma. I'm tired.<br> Let's go home.<br> I suppose it's too late to stop<br> someplace for a cup of coffee.<br> Who said it was too late?<br> - Easy does it, pal. Easy does it.<br> - I'm okay.<br> Sure, you are.<br> What about this Eleanor,<br> the girl from back home?<br> You say you graduated<br> from school together, huh?<br> Yep. She's a fine girl too.<br> What does she look like, redhead?<br> - Nope. Blond.<br> - Oh. I like the redheads.<br> There's a redhead<br> lives on the floor below me.<br> What a dish! I keep thinking,<br> I'll get off the elevator at the<br> wrong floor, but I never do.<br> Why not? Why don't you?<br> And have my wife make<br> a cripple out of me for life?<br> One shoe off,<br> and the other shoe off.<br> Diddle, diddle, dumpling<br> my son John<br> Hey, that don't rhyme<br> like it used to.<br> Did I ever tell you about Eleanor?<br> She's a girl I went to school with.<br> - Yes. I know. I know.<br> - Wonderful!<br> Just the girl for you.<br> Wonderful girl.<br> Look, bobbylocks,<br> don't worry about me.<br> Anytime I want to throw in the sponge,<br> you'll know it. I just won't be around.<br> - You about ready?<br> - Yes. See you next year.<br> Yes, indeed. We'll be here.<br> Take good care of yourself.<br> We will.<br> All right, son, get aboard.<br> - Bye!<br> - Bye!<br> I can't remember when<br> I've been as tired.<br> It's that resting<br> you did at the fair, Ma.<br> Three days' rest<br> will tire anybody out.<br> - Good-bye, Hank!<br> - Good-bye, Frake!
