Well, my.<br> Must be nice to be married<br> to a rich lawyer.<br> What's it for,<br> the living room?<br> No. For the nursery.<br> We wanted to tell you<br> when you and Daddy<br> were together, but<br> you're never together,<br> so... it's every man<br> for himself.<br> I'm pregnant.<br> I realize that.<br> Well, is that it?<br> Is that all you're going to say?<br> What do you want me to say?<br> Well, something along the lines<br> of "congratulations."<br> Congratulations.<br> Would it be too much to ask...<br> for a little excitement?<br> Not too much.<br> I wouldn't want you to<br> break a sweat or anything.<br> It's in July.<br> Oh, Mama.<br> You have to help me plan.<br> We're going to get a new house.<br> Jackson and I are going<br> house hunting next week.<br> Jackson loves to hunt<br> for anything.<br> What does Jackson say<br> about all this?<br> He's so excited.<br> He says he doesn't care<br> whether it's a boy or a girl,<br> but I know he really wants a son<br> so bad he can taste it.<br> He's really cute about the whole thing.<br> It's all he talks about...<br> Jackson Latcherie, Jr.<br> Does he ever listen?<br> I mean, when doctors<br> and specialists<br> give you advice,<br> does he listen?<br> I know you never do.<br> Does he?<br> Huh?<br> What?<br> Well, I guess since<br> he doesn't have to carry the baby,<br> it really isn't any of his concern.<br> Mama.<br> I want a child.<br> What about adoption?<br> You filled out all the applications.<br> Mama, no judge<br> is going to give a baby<br> to someone<br> with my medical record.<br> Jackson even put out feelers<br> about buying one.<br> People do it all the time.<br> Listen to me.<br> I want a child of my own.<br> I think it would help things a lot.<br> I see.<br> Mama, you worry too much.<br> In fact, I never worry,<br> 'cause I always know you're<br> worrying enough for both of us.<br> Jackson and I have given this<br> a lot of thought.<br> Has he really?<br> There's a first time<br> for everything.<br> Don't start on Jackson,<br> Mama.<br> Your poor body has<br> been through so much.<br> Why deliberately<br> do this to yourself?<br> Diabetics have healthy<br> babies all the time.<br> You are special, Shelby.<br> There are limits<br> to what you can do.<br> I'm going to be...<br> very, very careful.<br> Nobody's going to be hurt<br> or disappointed<br> or even inconvenienced.<br> Least of all Jackson, I'm sure.<br> You're jealous...<br> because you no longer<br> have a say-so in what I do,<br> and that drives you up the wall.<br> You're ready to spit nails<br> because you can't call the shots.<br> I did not raise my daughter<br> to talk to me like this.<br> Yes, you did.<br> Oh, no, I didn't.<br> Whenever any of us asked you<br> what you wanted for us<br> when we grew up, what did you say?<br> I'm not in the mood<br> to play games.<br> Just tell me what you said.<br> The only thing I have ever said to you<br> is that I want you to be happy.<br> Okay. The one thing that<br> would make me happy<br> is to have a baby.<br> If I could adopt one,<br> I would, but I can't.<br> I'm going to have a baby,<br> and I wish you'd be happy, too.<br> I'll tell you what I wish.<br> I don't know what I wish.<br> Mama, I don't know why you have to<br> make everything so difficult.<br> I look at having this baby<br> as the opportunity of a lifetime.<br> Sure, there may be risk involved,<br> but that's true for anybody.<br> But you get through it,<br> and life goes on.<br> When it's all said and done,<br> there'll be a little<br> piece of immortality<br> with Jackson's good looks<br> and my sense of style, I hope.<br> Please.<br> I need your support.<br> I would rather have<br> than a lifetime<br> of nothing special.<br> Okay. All right.<br> I'm going to hand it to you.<br> I don't want to hit you<br> upside the head.<br> I got one hole left.<br> Right.<br> Put the cords<br> behind the pole.<br> If they show,<br> it'll look tacky.<br> You told me about 40 times.<br> Annelle, did you do all this?<br> Guilty.<br> Truvy just turned over<br> the decoration<br> responsibility to me.<br> Look.<br> I went to the fire sale<br> at the Baptist book store<br> in Shreveport last week.<br> They had mismatched manger scenes<br> at incredibly low prices.<br> I cleaned them out<br> of baby Jesuses,<br> which I made into ornaments.<br> She's ready to roll.<br> Would you do the honors?<br> Yeah. Here you are,<br> Mrs. Latcherie.<br> Thanks, Sammy.<br> Ready?<br> Down in Louisiana<br> We have a Cajun Christmas...<br> Annelle, it's wonderful.<br> It works!<br> How cute.<br> I think your elves<br> have gone berserk.<br> Well, Shelby,<br> I wasn't expecting to see you.<br> What can I do for you?<br> I'm running a special<br> called a Christmas quickie.<br> I'm beyond help.<br> Last week I discovered<br> the early stages of crow's feet.<br> Honey, time marches on.<br> Eventually you realize<br> it's marching<br> across your face.<br> Oh, no.<br> It's Miss Ouiser.<br> I'm supposed to give her<br> a pedicure today.<br> I hate working<br> on her feet.<br> It could have<br> been worse.<br> She could have wanted<br> a bikini waxing.<br> Let's not get graphic.<br> Why not?<br> Miss Ouiser, I met<br> an old friend of yours.<br> Oh?<br> Owen Jenkins.<br> Oh.<br> Owen. Now, there's<br> a blast from the past.<br> Do you remember him?<br> He remembers you.<br> He had<br> the longest nose hair<br> in the free world.<br> Now he hardly has<br> any hair anywhere.<br> Owen's been gone<br> from Chinquapin Parish<br> since God was a boy.<br> I'd forgotten he'd existed.<br> He lives in Monroe<br> and goes to<br> First Presbyterian.<br> He asked if I knew you.<br> He used to live<br> in Ohio somewhere.<br> His wife just died,<br> and he's moved back down here.<br> Does this story have a point?<br> No, not really.<br> He just remembers you<br> fondly, I think.<br> I can't imagine why.<br> He was not a bad fellow,<br> but I managed<br> to run him off<br> and marry the first<br> of two total deadbeats.<br> Maybe sometime<br> I could arrange<br> for us all<br> to get together.<br> Maybe not.<br> Why not?<br> Shelby, I managed<br> in a few decades<br> to marry the two<br> most worthless men<br> in the universe<br> and then proceeded to have<br> the three most ungrateful children<br> ever conceived.<br> The only reason<br> people are nice to me<br> is because I have<br> more money than God.<br> I'm not about to open<br> a new can of worms.<br> Ouiser.<br> What?<br> If this is how you feel,<br> it isn't healthy.<br> Maybe you should come<br> to the guidance center<br> and talk to someone.<br> We're there to help.<br> I'm not crazy, M'Lynn.<br> I've just been<br> in a very bad mood<br> for 40 years.<br> [Doorbell Rings]<br> Hi.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Oh, look at you.<br> Is that new?<br> I made the dress<br> with my own two hands.<br> I just threw<br> the rest together.<br> The only thing<br> that separates us<br> from the animals<br> is our ability<br> to accessorize.<br> Oh.<br> Annelle,<br> why are you so late?<br> Did you and Sammy<br> get tangled up in the tinsel?<br> Truvy. You kill me.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Oh! Thank you.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Oh, darling.<br> I have to tell you<br> your nephew Marshall<br> is a little piece<br> of heaven on earth.<br> They're family,<br> and I love them,<br> but they do look carved<br> out of cream cheese.<br> Clairee,<br> I'm surprised at you<br> talking about<br> your kin that way.<br> Well, as somebody<br> always said,<br> if you can't say anything<br> nice about anybody,<br> come sit by me.<br> That's a good one.<br> Miss Ouiser.<br> What?<br> There's somebody<br> that wants<br> to see you.<br> Who?<br> I've opened the can<br> of worms for you.<br> What?<br> Hell.<br> Owen Jenkins.<br> Hello, Louisa.<br> Remember me?<br> My God, you look different.<br> Have you shrunk?<br> You look terrific.<br> You've hardly<br> changed at all.<br> I'm not as sweet<br> as I used to be.<br> Jesus Lord, at thy birth...<br> I cannot believe<br> Shelby did that.<br> Owen...<br> After all these years.<br> I'm not sure I can be<br> gracious under pressure.<br> Shelby does a lot of<br> things I can't believe.<br> M'Lynn, what's wrong<br> with you these days?<br> You got a reindeer<br> up your butt?<br> Everybody! Tommy,<br> get all these people outside.<br> Come on, everybody.<br> My dad's going<br> to say something.<br> I just want a moment<br> of your time, folks, now.<br> Today my daughter...<br> told me a big secret.<br> Daddy.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'm not going to tell them<br> you're pregnant.<br> Oh!<br> Oh!<br> Oh!<br> I'm just going to tell them<br> I'm going to be a granddaddy.<br> Oh. That's wonderful.<br> Oh, Grandma!<br> Congratulations.<br> Well, ain't you excited?<br> Smile. It increases<br> your face value.<br> And the doctor said Shelby<br> couldn't have children.<br> Yeah. What do they know?<br> She showed them.<br> They said she shouldn't<br> have children.<br> There's a big difference.<br> This baby is not exactly great news.<br> Jackson and Shelby.<br> [Cheering]<br> Oh, M'Lynn, I really wish<br> I had some words of wisdom,<br> but I don't.<br> Why don't we focus on<br> the joy of the situation?<br> It'll be fine.<br> Absolutely.<br> You know what they say...<br> That which does not kill us<br> makes us stronger.<br> Nothing pleases Shelby more<br> than proving me wrong.<br> Oh, and to<br> my new grandbaby...<br> May he be as<br> good-looking as I am.<br> Born on the third of July<br> He's a Yankee Doodle sweetheart<br> He's a Yankee Doodle boy<br> Yankee Doodle went to London<br> Just to ride the ponies<br> He is a Yankee Doodle boy<br> Whoo!<br> Go ahead.<br> Blow it out, buddy.<br> This is boring as hell.<br> You only have your<br> first birthday once.<br> Little buddy's<br> making a wish.<br> I wish he'd just<br> blow out the candle.<br> I can't stand this.<br> Don't you dare.<br> Come on.<br> Look.
