Stay as you are.<br> Don't pretend.<br> Anyway, it isn't really well-bred<br> to act the way you aren't.<br> But I wanted to be different<br> ever since I met you.<br> If I was around you long enough,<br> I could be.<br> I could learn to talk like you<br> and act like you.<br> Pretty soon, l...<br> Well, you've done a lot for me<br> even in these couple of weeks.<br> You've done a lot for me too.<br> I was very lonely the day you walked in.<br> Oh, no, I don't smoke<br> and I don't drink either.<br> I was lonely and unhappy,<br> and then you...<br> Yes?<br> Oh, I shouldn't have.<br> You won't have<br> any respect for me.<br> Not for girls who let men kiss them<br> whenever they want.<br> I mean, I don't let...<br> I mean...<br> Well, a girl shouldn't<br> unless they...<br> Well...<br> unless they know a man is serious.<br> Ain't she got home yet?<br> Does the old man...<br> - Hello, Pop.<br> - What time did Stella get home?<br> Huh? Oh, that was about...<br> That was around...<br> Oh, I don't know,<br> but she woke me up.<br> Hey, Mom, how about the coffee?<br> And Pop's too.<br> Tell Stella I want to see her.<br> Gee, it was kind of late.<br> Let her sleep.<br> Tell Stella I want to see her.<br> Yes.<br> Why, she ain't here.<br> I wonder where she<br> could've gone so early?<br> She ain't slept there.<br> She spent the night with Carrie Jenkins.<br> It was raining hard.<br> She didn't go out with Carrie.<br> Why should she stay the night with her?<br> When she gets home, tell her to take<br> her things and be out before I get back.<br> Listen, you can't.<br> Give her a chance to explain.<br> You shut up!<br> Tell her what I said.<br> All right, then I guess<br> that goes for me too.<br> Finish your coffee.<br> I'll talk to your pa.<br> I don't want coffee or any part<br> of this dump from now on.<br> I'm through!<br> - I'll tell you later.<br> - Gee, where have you been?<br> - The old man's...<br> - Look, Charlie.<br> Married?

Yes, ma'am.<br> I know who's gonna be boss<br> around here from now on.<br> Oh, gosh.<br> Home never looked so good to me.<br> Poor Stella.<br> I didn't mind it.<br> The hospital got on my nerves.<br> That darned doctor trying<br> to make me stay another week.<br> - He thought it would be better...<br> - Better for who?<br> It was just to get your money.<br> I felt as good the next day as ever.<br> Maybe better than I had<br> for a while.<br> Oh, Stephen,<br> why didn't you bring them to me?<br> The days wouldn't have seemed<br> half so long.<br> - I thought everybody'd forgotten me.<br> - I think we'll get you to bed.<br> Bed? I just got up.<br> Haven't you seen enough of me<br> in bed for the past three weeks?<br> Seems like three years to me.<br> You'll soon find you're not<br> as strong as you think you are.<br> You must remember I've had a great deal<br> of experience in these maternity cases.<br> Experience?<br> What do you think I had?<br> Tell me why doctors, nurses<br> and husbands...<br> always think they know more<br> about this maternity business.<br> Don't you think a mother learns anything<br> in that room they wheel her into?<br> Or is that just<br> a kindergarten class?<br> Let me tell you. I picked up<br> quite an experience in that room.<br> That wasn't out of books either.<br> Experience.<br> - Stephen.<br> - Yes, dear?<br> A dance at the River Club<br> tomorrow night.<br> I think I can wear<br> my blue dress.<br> - I'll let it out a little at the top.<br> - You don't want to go dancing already.<br> Before I went to the hospital,<br> I was stuck in this house...<br> for four solid months<br> without going anywheres.<br> We just got in to the River Club.<br> All my life I've died to go to the real<br> places and get in with the right crowd.<br> Just when I got a chance to get started,<br> I have to give it all up.<br> We'll go next time.<br> I don't want to go next time.<br> I want to go this time.<br> Stephen, I won't dance much.<br> I promise.<br> I just want to get a wave<br> and a manicure...<br> and get all dressed up again<br> and go hear some music...<br> and forget all about doctors<br> and hospitals and nurses.<br> And babies?<br> Ah, but Stephen, please.<br> Why, you're a wonderful dancer,<br> Mr. Munn.<br> If I'm any judge of horse flesh,<br> you don't shake a mean leg yourself.<br> Who's that she's dancing with?<br> He's pretty good too.<br> - I really don't know.<br> - His name is Munn.<br> He has something to do<br> with horse races.<br> The girls invite him over for golf,<br> and he gives them tips.<br> How'd you come to get hooked up<br> to a table like that?<br> They're some business friends<br> of my husband's.<br> Business friends?<br> What is he, an undertaker?<br> Get him to ditch that bunch of moss bags<br> and come over and join us.<br> Spencer Chandler's table?<br> We don't even know him.<br> Well, that won't take long.<br> - You know what he said after our dance?<br> - No. What?<br> He said, ''Ed...''<br> He always calls me Ed.<br> ''You can pick winners on a dance floor<br> better than you can on a racetrack.''<br> Yeah? Ah, go on.<br> Don't red apple me.<br> No, on the level.<br> I'll prove it to you.<br> I'd have to ask Stephen first.<br> - Yes?<br> - Come here.<br> Excuse me. Yes?<br> - This is Mr. Munn.<br> - How are you?<br> Mr. Spencer Chandler wants us<br> to come over to his table.<br> - I'm sorry. We're just leaving.<br> - Leaving?<br> - It's only quarter after.<br> - I know, but that's late for us.<br> - Come just for a nightcap.<br> - Yes, Stephen, please.<br> I'm afraid we can't.<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> I'll get the things.<br> He dug it out of his pocket.<br> The horse came in and paid 20 to 1.<br> What do you think of that?<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Did you lose something?<br> - What was it?<br> - May I help you?<br> I remember.<br> I gave it to Mr...<br> Pardon me.<br> - What do you think of that?<br> - What a story.<br> Say, Ed, did you give me back<br> my handkerchief?<br> - You never gave it to me.<br> - I must have lost it.<br> - Take mine.<br> - No, I didn't mean...<br> Wait a minute. I want you<br> to meet a friend of mine.<br> - Mr. Chandler, this is Mrs. Dallas.<br> - How do you do?<br> Spencer, I want you to prove<br> something to her for me.<br> Didn't you say I could pick 'em on<br> the dance floor as good as on the track?<br> I wouldn't feel too flattered. Munn<br> hasn't given me a winner in a month.<br> - Will you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> Miss Dallas, I'd like you<br> to meet Miss Terry.<br> I believe your wife lost something,<br> and she thought maybe Mr...<br> - Mr. Munn might know.<br> - Thank you.<br> Stephen, this is Mr. Chandler.<br> Mr. Chandler, my husband.<br> Mr. Chandler asked me to dance.<br> You don't mind?<br> Sorry, my wife's just out of<br> the hospital and should be in bed.<br> We'll hurry then.<br> Come on.<br> You wouldn't like to sit down<br> and have a little snifter?<br> No, thank you very much.<br> Thank you.<br> What have I done this time?<br> I'll take my usual lecture. Begin.<br> Stella, I asked you not<br> to wear those earrings...<br> that cheap imitation necklace.<br> You took them off.<br> You agreed.<br> Then after we got there,<br> you came out of the dressing room...<br> I'm perfectly willing to let you<br> tell me how to talk and act.<br> But please don't give me pointers<br> on how to dress.<br> Allow me at least to know more<br> about one thing than you do.<br> After all, I've always been known<br> to have stacks of style.<br> You should have heard Ed Munn,<br> and he's been around a bit too.<br> He's traveled further,<br> and he...<br> All right, then, farther.<br> Whichever it is, I don't care.<br> Gosh, I have to think twice<br> every time I open my mouth.<br> Spencer Chandler didn't seem to<br> have to turn the other way either.<br> He only happens to be<br> one of the Chandlers.<br> Please don't say things<br> like that.<br> - Remember you're my wife now.<br> - And can't look at another man.<br> - That isn't the point at all.<br> - That's a laugh.<br> An affair between<br> Spencer Chandler and I.<br> Well, I am coming up<br> in the world.<br> Stella, can't you...<br> Won't you try to understand?<br> Please listen to me this time.<br> Please.<br> The fake jewelry is not important.<br> Chandler's not important.<br> None of these things matter<br> in themselves.<br> But what's to become of us?<br> That is important.<br> Stella,<br> why did you marry me?<br> Because I was crazy about you, silly,<br> and I still am, only...<br> - Only you just don't seem to ever...<br> - Once, a long time ago...<br> you said you were crazy<br> to learn everything, become someone.<br> Didn't you?<br> - Yes, Stephen.<br> - Please listen to me.<br> I'm only telling you this<br> because I love you.<br> Beamer wants to send me to New York<br> to handle the sales department there.<br> I want to go.<br> I want to take you with me,<br> but I want you to make an effort.<br> I want you to try to be...<br> what you wanted to be.<br> Give up a few things for me<br> and try to adapt yourself...<br> Adapt myself?<br> Give up a few things?<br> Well, what have I been doing<br> ever since I met you?<br> I'm getting<br> a little sick of it too.<br> How would it be for you to do<br> a little adapting for a change?<br> I don't see you<br> giving up anything.<br> I'll tell you one more thing.<br> I'm not going to New York.<br> I'm not gonna leave here just when I'm<br> beginning to get with the right people.<br> You go on and go to New York.<br> I'm gonna stay here.<br> Can you beat that?<br> Laying awake waiting for her dinner,<br> and not a squawk out of her.<br> Gosh, Carrie...<br> I used to think girls<br> at the mill were crazy...<br> when they got married and right<br> off the bat started having kids.<br> But honest, Stella,<br> would you want any more?<br> Sure, if I could have<br> another one like her.<br> She's been a regular pal to me.<br> Since Stephen's been away in New York,<br> I hardly know I have a husband.<br> He's only been here three times<br> this summer, and only on account of her.<br> He's crazy about her.<br> Who wouldn't be?<br> Oh, look at her.<br> Wiping it up at her age.<br> Can you beat that?<br> She's the spit of her old man.<br> Now, who's that? Edna?<br> Is this all the welcome I get?<br> Of all people!<br> - Gosh, I'm glad to see you.<br> - And I you.<br> - I haven't seen you for ages.<br> - Get a load of that kid.<br> Has she grown,<br> or am I crazy?<br> Come on.<br> Gee, Stell, she looks more<br> like you every time.<br> You remember Uncle Ed,<br> don't you, darling?<br> I remember you.<br> - Oh, let me see.<br> - How's that?<br> Oh, Ed, you shouldn't<br> have done this.<br> Don't she look like a little queen?<br> It's gold and turquoise.<br> Edna!<br> You want a drink, don't you?<br> Sure, and if you don't mind,<br> I'll peel this coat.<br> Sure, go ahead.<br> What'll it be?<br> You know me.

Maybe<br> you've been having too much fun here.<br> - I haven't been out for two months.<br> - Been sick?<br> I don't seem to get any fun<br> out of a good time anymore.<br> All the time I'm out, I'm thinkin'<br> of her and what she's doing...<br> and how soon I can get back to her.<br> Well, here's hoping I'll always<br> be around at the right time.<br> - What are you drinking?<br> - Sarsaparilla.<br> Stealin' the kid's drinks, huh?<br> Did you ever catch her<br> sneaking your oatmeal?<br> - Say, can I pick her up?<br> - Sure, go ahead.<br> Come to your Uncle Ed.<br> Got ya, girl.<br> Come on. Ain't you got a big smile<br> for your Uncle Ed?<br> Of course she has.<br> Come on.

That's all.<br> Come on, fellas.<br> Mother's ready.<br> - Come on, boys.<br> - Mother, he rows it himself.<br> Can't we wait until he winds it again?<br> I want you to see how it goes.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Dallas.<br> - You'll send those right away?<br> - Helen.<br> - Oh, Stephen.<br> - I'm so glad to see you.<br> - And you.<br> Boys, come here, please.<br> - Stephen, these are my sons.<br> - How do you do, young gentlemen?<br> How do you do?<br> This is Mr. Dallas, whom your mother<br> has known for such a long time.<br> John.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Lee.<br> - And Cornelius.<br> - Con.<br> He doesn't like<br> to be called Cornelius.<br> I do too.<br> It was my father's name.<br> - Was?<br> - Con's the man of the family now.<br> He looks after us all so beautifully.<br> His father would be very proud.<br> Splendid. Nothing but the finest care<br> would be good enough for your mother.<br> But, Stephen,<br> tell us about you.<br> I gave up all thought of ever<br> seeing you again such a long time ago.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - New York? I'm in business here.<br> If you mean this store, I'm buying<br> birthday presents for my daughter.<br> Your daughter? Oh, Stephen.<br> - Here she is.<br> - Oh, she's pretty.<br> - When may we meet her and her mother?<br> - They're not here.<br> Laurel goes to school near Boston,<br> and her mother spends her time with her.<br> I have so many things to hear<br> and to tell.<br> - Can you lunch with us?<br> - I should be back at the office now.<br> We'd be glad to have you, if you<br> don't mind carrying your own tray.<br> John's been saving up for a whole month<br> to take us to lunch. It's his treat.<br> That's all right. I got enough for<br> one more, if you don't eat too much.<br> How 'bout it, Mr. Dallas?<br> - I can't refuse an offer like that.<br> - Oh, good. Come along.<br> If you run short,<br> I'll lend you a couple of dollars.<br> Gee, thanks.<br> Oh, books again.<br> I've got a good mind to tell him<br> she can get books from the library.<br> But there's no place where you<br> can get a fur coat for nothing.<br> Boy, what I wouldn't give<br> to see her in one.<br> Oh, well. Here.<br> Hide them with the rest<br> and let me get on with this...<br> or it won't be ready for Christmas,<br> let alone her birthday.<br> - Gladys, where's Mother?<br> - Now, let me see.<br> She's...<br> - Hello, Mother.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> Miss Phillibrown, my teacher,<br> came home with me.<br> - She wants to see you.<br> - If I'd known, I could have fixed up.<br> Look at me. I'm a sight.<br> Look at the things all...<br> Oh, dear.<br> Mother, this is Miss Phillibrown.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Pleased to meet ya.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - I haven't a minute, but...<br> Thank you. My dear, I wonder<br> if I might have a glass of water.<br> - Of course. You too?<br> - No.<br> Maybe she'd rather have sarsaparilla.<br> I have some on ice.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - All right.<br> She's such a darling.<br> I didn't want to talk in front of her<br> in case she might be disappointed.<br> I spend the weekends in Boston.<br> May I borrow Laurel for this one?<br> I couldn't get her ready this time,<br> but if you'd ask her again...<br> Lollie thinks the world of you.<br> I know she'd have a wonderful time,<br> seeing some decent shows...<br> not just movies.<br> I had in mind<br> the galleries and museums.<br> - She seems so interested.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> She's crazy about that stuff.<br> She gets it from her father.<br> Her father?<br> You see,<br> I've only heard about you.<br> Oh. 'Course, she don't see<br> as much of her father.<br> Mr. Dallas' business<br> keeps him in New York.<br> - Really?<br> - But I always spend vacation with him.<br> Up in Maine, in the woods.<br> Have you ever been there?<br> Oh, it's beautiful.<br> Your mother's given her permission<br> for you to spend a weekend in Boston.<br> - When?<br> - Very soon.<br> Oh, thank you, Miss Phillibrown.<br> - I really must go.<br> - Oh, must ya?<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Dallas.<br> - Good-bye. Come again.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good-bye, Laurel, dear.<br> - Good-bye, Miss Phillibrown.<br> - Mother, isn't she the nicest?<br> - Yes, darling.<br> - Did you ask her to the party?<br> - No. You think she'd come?<br> Of course. Why not?<br> Mother! For the party?<br> What did you do that for?<br> You're always sticking your...<br> Mother, I'm sorry.<br> Come here.<br> I didn't mean to...<br> You know how I always fly off,<br> and l...<br> Well, I wanted it<br> to be a surprise...<br> Well, now that you've seen it,<br> you may as well slip it on...<br> and let me fit you<br> instead of this thing.<br> - Dummy.<br> - Oh, it's blue.<br> There.<br> - It's beautiful!<br> - Careful. Don't mash the ruffles.<br> Now. Oh, yeah, I forgot.<br> This goes here.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Yes, it gives it a little snap.<br> You're just like your father. You want<br> everything plain as an old shoe.<br> Plain? With all these<br> beautiful, handmade ruffles.<br> Now, turn around.<br> Yes, the length's all right.<br> It's just the sleeves.<br> Take it off, let me get on with it.<br> - Yoo-hoo! What's going on in there?<br> - Come on in, Ed.<br> Wait till I get out.<br> What is this?<br> A Follies dressing room?<br> What's the matter?<br> He shouldn't see me like this.<br> Ed's known you since you were knee-high<br> and seen you with hardly anything on.<br> Even less than that. What have you<br> got to hide from your uncle?<br> - Let me see.<br> - Mother, make him stop.<br> Stop!<br> Lollie, don't be a little fool.<br> I wish you wouldn't tease her.<br> You know she don't like it.<br> I know, but I get a kick from<br> a young one being so finicky.<br> Well.<br> - Your car downstairs?<br> - No.<br> It's in the shop. Why?<br> I wanted to go to town and get<br> the decorations for the party.<br> Why not go in on the train?<br> Take the kid, see a show, have dinner.<br> No, I don't want her<br> to know what I'm getting.<br> Oh, I see.<br> I guess I could show you<br> a better time without her.<br> - How long will you be?<br> - I won't be long.<br> - Unless you got a drink here...<br> - I got sarsaparilla.<br> I'll meet you at the corner.<br> Sarsaparilla.<br> Honest, some of the things<br> I do for you.<br> You'll like it when you get used to it,<br> and it's good for you too.<br> - What's that?<br> - You can read, can't you?<br> Ltch powder?<br> Things are just a little<br> too quiet around here.<br> Hey, can I see that?<br> What's the name of that horse?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I got a ticket on it.<br> - Kokomo wins. I'm rich!<br> - Let me shake your hand.<br> Thank you.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'm awfully glad.<br> - I stand to win $30,000.<br> - Good.<br> - Have a cigar.<br> - What happened?<br> - Have a cigar.<br> - Sir!<br> - You want gum. We go to all parts here.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you.<br> - Say, that was great luck.<br> - Did you see what happened?<br> He won $30,000 on a horse race.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - Kidding?<br> Watch 'em commence.<br> I can't stand it.<br> Another one just bit the dust.<br> You're killing me.<br> Get the old girls.<br> They're doing a sister act.<br> They must have rehearsed.<br> What's so funny?<br> Now what'd you do?<br> Come on, look.<br> They're two down there.<br> Gee, Ed, I don't see how you<br> can keep such a straight face.<br> What's a little kidding<br> among friends?<br> - Is that the father?<br> - No, it can't be.<br> She particularly said<br> her husband was in New York.<br> Such women don't deserve<br> to have children.<br> The one way to drink sarsaparilla<br> is so it don't taste like sarsaparilla.<br> Do you mind?<br> You want some?<br> Laurel's such a lovely child.<br> I don't know what to think.<br> Mary Anne's been asked<br> to her party.<br> Scratch that first entry of yours<br> and give somebody else a chance.<br> - Honest, I'd do anything...<br> - Please don't, Ed.<br> It's like I told you.<br> It's not personal.<br> I don't think there's a man living<br> that could get me goin' anymore.<br> I don't know. I guess Lollie just<br> uses up all the feelings I've got.<br> I don't seem to have any left<br> for anybody else.<br> You got plenty for me.<br> Why can't we go on as we are?<br> I don't know what<br> I would have done without you...<br> when Loli was with Stephen.<br> You're such a good sport<br> and such a lot of fun.<br> I guess you know<br> what you're doing.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I got some of that stuff on me.<br> Wouldn't that be a hit?<br> I have.<br> It's all over here.<br> Gladys, are you nearly ready?<br> I have to let her in.<br> I'm ready. Miss Dallas!<br> Do I look all right?<br> None of them have ever seen me.<br> She's always telling them<br> how beautiful I am.<br> Honey, you sure<br> can live up to it.<br> But if I live through this day,<br> I'm gonna get me another corset.<br> Coming, dear.<br> How ever did you do it?<br> Oh, and you, Mother.<br> You look beautiful.<br> Do I?<br> Some favors!<br> Don't pull 'em. They pop<br> and have little hats inside.<br> - And little baskets.<br> - I put candies in with the nuts.<br> The place cards! They're beautiful.<br> Where did you get them?<br> I sit there,<br> and you sit here.<br> And Miss Phillibrown next to me,<br> and Flo Bell.<br> And Alice May.<br> Mother,<br> could I see the cake?<br> Go ahead.<br> Oh, look!<br> - One, two, three, four, five, six...<br> - You like it?<br> Here somebody is!<br> - Let Gladys go.<br> - All right.<br> Remember what I told you.<br> Yeah.<br> - Is this the Dallas residence?<br> - Yes.<br> Sign here, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's for you, Lollie.<br> Don't forget to say Laurel<br> in front of other people.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - What is it?<br> It's from Miss Phillibrown.<br> She can't come.<br> What did she say?<br> ''Dear, I'm sorry it's impossible<br> for me to come to your party...<br> but I'm thinking of you<br> this afternoon...<br> and I hope you will not<br> be disappointed.<br> Sincerely, your friend<br> Margaret Phillibrown.''<br> That's too bad.<br> I do wish she could've come<br> just to see everything. And you.<br> Well, I'll fix up again<br> for her sometime.<br> Most likely the girls will have<br> a better time without her.<br> They see enough of her in school.<br> I know I did my teachers.<br> Everyone loves Miss Phillibrown.<br> Take these, please.<br> Well, anyway,<br> it'll make an even number.<br> Sure.<br> Come on. We'll wait<br> in the other room.<br> You sit over there.<br> Let Gladys go.<br> Remember what I told you.<br> - Miss Dallas' residence.<br> - That's right.<br> Miss Dallas' residence.<br> Okay. I'll tell her.<br> - Who was it?<br> - Miss Cheeny.<br> She says Alice May can't come.<br> Who?<br> Alice May Cheeny.<br> She sits next to me in school.<br> It'll make the table look better.<br> It won't be so crowded.<br> I'll fix it.<br> I better make some more biscuits.<br> The others is all dried up.<br> Yeah. Let's do that.<br> That's a very good idea.<br> You know, Mother.<br> They're not coming, or they'd be here.<br> Oh, Lollie, you don't think that...<br> We'll go in together.<br> I never know what to look for.<br> You change so much each time.<br> - Do I look older?<br> - Older? You're a young lady.<br> - Your wardrobe's growing up too.<br> - I have a costume for everything.<br> Fine, because we have<br> a wonderful invitation...<br> to spend our whole time together in<br> the most beautiful place in the world.<br> Better than Maine?<br> Where?<br> You'll see.<br> - How are you?<br> - Martha, this is my daughter, Laurel.<br> How do you do?<br> Oh, Daddy, how beautiful.<br> - This is Mrs. Morrison.<br> - How do you do?<br> - So glad to see you.<br> - I'm so glad to see you too.<br> Michael, this is Laurel<br> we've been waiting to meet.<br> Now, don't overdo it.<br> He's such a nice dog.<br> - Where are the boys?<br> - Still down at the stables.<br> Tell them their surprise is here.<br> You don't mind being a surprise?<br> Come on, Mike,<br> we'll go fetch 'em.<br> I'll show Laurel her room.<br> It's lovely.<br> How sweet.<br> If you let me have your keys,<br> I'll have Martha unpack you.<br> Oh, I can do it.<br> I'll take your coat.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> And your hat.<br> Oh, everything.<br> I like nice closets too.<br> We'll hang this here.<br> I'm so glad you brought<br> your riding clothes.<br> It was one of the things on my list,<br> to ride in Central Park.<br> We'll be using them here too.<br> And so many pretty dresses.<br> The fun your mother must have<br> choosing them for you.<br> She makes them all.<br> She does?<br> Oh, how clever.<br> What a lucky girl you are.<br> How lucky she is too.<br> All boys want to wear<br> are overalls.<br> I suppose you want to freshen up.<br> But don't change.<br> I'll see that your father has his tea.<br> He has to get right back to town.<br> Come down when you're ready.<br> Don't keep the boys waiting too long.<br> Thank you.<br> They won't acknowledge they like her.<br> They haven't got as far as that.<br> But have you noticed the hair brushing<br> and collar wearing going on?<br> I have.<br> Mother...<br> am I too little<br> to dance with Laurel?<br> - Did she say so?<br> - No, but Con did.<br> If I wanted to dance with Laurel,<br> I'd ask her, not Con.<br> I will.<br> Big intrigue.<br> Let me have it.<br> You'll drop it.<br> I will not.<br> - Why don't you let Con carry it?<br> - I wanna carry it.<br> - Good-bye. It's been fun.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> We'll look forward so<br> to next time.<br> I've had such a lovely time,<br> I don't know how to thank you.<br> Good-bye, Laurel.<br> I brought your suitcase.<br> - Here's a present for you.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> Good-bye!<br> Oh, aren't they the nicest boys?<br> I think so.<br> How did you like Mrs. Morrison?<br> I think she's<br> the loveliest lady I ever knew.<br> Do you really, Laurel?<br> Oh, I mean... I mean...<br> Of course, I mean,<br> except my mother.<br> Mother, how nice!<br> It's a little stuffy.<br> I'm gonna open a window.<br> All right.<br> You happy?<br> I guess I'll shove off.<br> You two got lots to talk about.<br> So, what are you<br> gonna eat, Ed?<br> Me? I don't know.<br> I ain't very hungry.<br> I thought maybe<br> I'd stop in at...<br> Come back<br> and have dinner with us.<br> - You only bought two chops.<br> - One for you, one for Lollie.<br> I'm so happy,<br> I couldn't even look at a meal.<br> - What time?<br> - An hour.<br> So long, lollipops. I'll come back<br> and tie on the nose bag with ya.<br> - Want me to bring anything?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Why did you? I thought we were<br> gonna have a nice, quiet time alone.<br> So did I, Lollie, darling.<br> Things haven't been going<br> so good for poor Ed lately.<br> You'd never know it<br> to hear him talk.<br> You remember that big watch<br> and chain he used to wear?<br> Well, they're just<br> not there anymore.<br> I'm sorry.<br> She's not here anymore.<br> I let her go.<br> What did I need<br> with anybody around?<br> Oh, Mother, you shouldn't have.<br> Besides, I was glad to have something<br> to do to help pass the time away.<br> You know what I did?<br> I saved enough money out of her wages<br> for a deposit on a fur coat for you.<br> Mother, you didn't.<br> You're just going to<br> get it right back.<br> I don't want a fur coat now.<br> None of the girls at Mrs. Morrison's<br> are allowed to have them yet.<br> Oh, no?<br> Here.<br> You know what I've been thinking?<br> Would it cost too awfully much<br> for us to have a house...<br> with our own front door<br> and a little garden and flowers...<br> and a room for each of us?<br> Just in case sometimes we wanted<br> somebody to stay all night.<br> Mother, not a great big<br> expensive house like Mrs. Morrison's...<br> but just a little tiny place.<br> Say, tell me<br> about this Mrs. Morrison.<br> - What's she like?<br> - Mother, she's lovely.<br> She's sort of...<br> Well, she reminds me<br> of a flower...<br> that grows up in Maine.<br> All pale and delicate,<br> but strong too.<br> I don't know what you call it.<br> I don't care what kind<br> of a flower she looks like.<br> Is she tall or short,<br> dark or light, fat or thin?<br> - How old is she?<br> - She's not any special age.<br> She's like one of those goddesses<br> in my mythology book that way.<br> Come now. You can tell<br> whether she's 20 or 40.<br> Oh, she's not 40, no.<br> I guess maybe she's about 25.<br> And how did your father<br> happen to meet this goddess?<br> It's like a story.<br> Con told me all about it.<br> Con. Is that her husband?<br> Oh, no, he's dead.<br> Didn't I write you?<br> Dead, is he?<br> Well, that's convenient.<br> No, it isn't a bit convenient.<br> When Mr. Morrison died,<br> he left a whole lot of houses...<br> and horses and money.<br> Mrs. Morrison has to look out<br> for them all by herself.<br> She said she wouldn't know<br> what to do...<br> without Father to help her<br> and advise her.<br> Yeah. I can just imagine.<br> I just remembered.<br> I've got some snapshots of her.<br> - I just want to look at you.<br> - I want you to see her.<br> She's beautiful.<br> You'll be crazy about her!<br> The funny thing about her is that<br> she's not only beautiful all dressed...<br> but even when she wakes up<br> in the morning.<br> She spends hardly any time<br> on her face.<br> Once I saw her put soap and water<br> right on it.<br> All I can say is there are<br> different kinds of skin.<br> Besides, with her money,<br> she don't have to worry about her looks.<br> Say, are those real pearls<br> she's got slung around her neck?<br> - Look what you're doing!<br> - What?<br> You're getting cold cream<br> all over her picture.<br> - I didn't mean it.<br> - Give it to me.<br> I'll do it.<br> Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells<br> Jingle all the...<br> Hi, lollipops.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> Here is the mistletoe.<br> Now, where's the kiss?<br> Run along. Go inside.<br> What do you mean by showing up<br> here in this condition? Get out.<br> I've got something for you.<br> I've been robbed.<br> Why, if I thought<br> that anybody would take...<br> Here you are, my dear.<br> A very Merry Christmas.<br> No, thanks. I can't take it.<br> I wouldn't know what to do with it.<br> Oh. What to do with it.<br> Cook it.<br> Run along,<br> give it to somebody else.<br> Me give my chicken to somebody else?<br> You think I'm gonna do that?<br> You come out of there.<br> Ed, what are you trying to do,<br> set the place on fire?<br> Cookin' a turkey.<br> Get that thing out of here.<br> - I say yes.<br> - Don't tell me how to cook a turkey.<br> I know how to cook a turkey.<br> - Now, come on.<br> - Now, listen.<br> I know how to cook it,<br> and so there.<br> The feet won't be very well done,<br> but I don't care for feet anyway.<br> Ed, be reasonable.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Father!<br> I'm so glad to see you.<br> And am I glad to see you.<br> What a nice surprise.<br> You should see the way<br> I've been running to the door.<br> I never dreamed of anything so wonderful<br> as your bringing them yourself.<br> Ooh, what a lovely tree.<br> Here you are.<br> Oh, thank you, Daddy.<br> I'll put them right here<br> while I go call Mother.<br> I'll take your coat and hat.<br> This is a fine Christmas spirit.<br> You don't have anything in the house.<br> Strawberry. There you are.<br> Strawberry.<br> And lemon.<br> Peach.<br> What is this?<br> This is more sarsaparilla.<br> Of all the places I ever saw,<br> a man can't have any...<br> Go inside and keep him company.<br> I'll get dressed as fast as I can.<br> What are you whispering?<br> - You've got to go. I've got company.<br> - Oh, company.<br> - Who's the company?<br> - Never you mind. Just go.<br> I'd like to see the guy.<br> I tell you, Stella, no, sir.<br> I'm gonna sit right here<br> until I find out who the company is.<br> No, you're not.<br> You're gonna go.<br> Pushin' and a-shovin'!<br> I think the company<br> would like the turkey too.<br> It was the biggest turkey<br> I could find.<br> One of the finest turks<br> that the man had.<br> I never saw such a big turkey<br> in all of my life.<br> Daddy, a wristwatch.<br> How lovely.<br> - Do you like it, darling?<br> - Yes.<br> You're getting so grown up,<br> I don't know what to buy for you.<br> Mother copied it from one we saw<br> in the window of a shop in Boston.<br> - You can hardly tell the difference.<br> - It is pretty, isn't it?<br> - It was my best present till you came.<br> - Oh, you doll.<br> Well!<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas to you.<br> It's good to see you again.<br> - Well, it's good to see you.<br> - Sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> - The place looks awfully nice.<br> - You'll go to dinner with us?<br> Well, darling, l...<br> I came to ask your mother a favor.<br> I was wondering if you'd let me have<br> Laurel for the holidays this time.<br> I've never had a place<br> for her before.<br> This time we have an invitation<br> to spend it with the Morrisons.<br> Well.<br> - Would you like to go, Lollie?<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh, that is, if...<br> - Oh, I think it would be lovely.<br> - When would you want her?<br> - Well, my train leaves in an hour.<br> I was hoping I could<br> take her back with me.<br> - Today?<br> - No, not today. I couldn't, Father.<br> Mother and I<br> had something all planned.<br> Well, yes, we did, but...<br> Well, we could do that anytime.<br> Come on.<br> We'll have to hurry.<br> You have your new coat,<br> and you'll want these things.<br> I'll just get her started.<br> Excuse us. Hurry.<br> - There's your case there.<br> - Will this do for the train?<br> That's fine. Pack what you need now,<br> and I'll send your trunk on tonight.<br> All right.<br> She won't be very long.<br> This is for you, Stella.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Stella, I'm awfully sorry...<br> when I see all you've done here,<br> and you did have plans.<br> - I didn't realize...<br> - Oh, it wasn't anything, really.<br> We were just going to a show<br> and dinner at the Bontonne.<br> This'll be<br> a real treat for her.<br> It's been so long<br> since I've seen you.<br> - How have you been?<br> - Well, thank you.<br> - And you?<br> - Oh, fine.<br> That's good.<br> Too bad your train<br> leaves so early.<br> Stella, l...<br> I've been thinking.<br> I don't know why it didn't<br> occur to me before...<br> but there's no earthly reason<br> why you should spend today all alone...<br> just because I've been<br> selfish and thoughtless.<br> There must be a later train.<br> Where's the telephone?<br> Shall we call and see?<br> Oh, yes, please!<br> Here.<br> Beacon Hill 3700, please.<br> Fooled you, didn't I?<br> You put me out the back door<br> and I went around again...<br> right in here.<br> Just where is all this company<br> that I'm being kicked out because of?<br> I'm gonna tell you this. You're not<br> gonna feed 'em my turkey. No, sir.<br> Not...<br> I beg your pardon.<br> I guess l...<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Stella.<br> I didn't mean to...<br> I guess I'll go now.<br> Mr. Dallas.<br> He's had a little too much<br> Christmas, I guess.<br> He was here a while ago<br> and brought a turkey.<br> I had a terrible time<br> getting rid of him.<br> - What did you find out about the train?<br> - I'm afraid it'll be too late.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm all ready.<br> Was I very long?<br> Not at all, darling.<br> Good-bye, Stella.<br> I'll take good care of her.<br> Bye, Stephen.<br> Good-bye, Mother.<br> - Good-bye, Stella.<br> - Bye.<br> Thank you for letting me go.<br> - Mrs. Dallas, Mr. Morley.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Dallas?<br> Won't you sit down, please?<br> I wrote you a letter,<br> and in it I stated...<br> Don't tell me what you stated.<br> Just tell me what you meant.<br> It's only natural to suppose that you<br> should wish to legalize your position...<br> Legalize my position?<br> I've got a marriage license.<br> What are you tryin' to give me?<br> Your freedom.<br> A divorce.<br> Mr. Dallas feels,<br> and I can readily understand why...<br> that you might wish to remarry.<br> Let's get down to brass tacks. I haven't<br> the slightest idea of ever remarryin'.<br> Now, it don't happen,<br> by any chance, to be...<br> Mr. Dallas who wishes<br> to remarry, does it?<br> Well, assuming for the moment<br> that it does...<br> surely you could have<br> no objection.<br> Your allowance would be the same.<br> As a matter of fact, Mr. Dallas might<br> even be able to increase the amount...<br> I don't want any increases. Let him<br> keep it, and let me keep my daughter.<br> Mr. Dallas has no intention<br> of any change regarding your daughter.<br> Oh, he hasn't. Then what's he<br> been tryin' to win her away for?<br> Takin' her to fine hotels,<br> country places, town houses.<br> Makin' her dissatisfied with<br> the kinds of things I been givin' her.<br> Does he think I don't see what he's<br> after? He'll never get away with it.<br> I'm gonna give her the same things.<br> Everything her heart's been set on.<br> Fine hotels, fancy friends. I'm gonna<br> give 'em to her, and he'll pay for 'em.<br> If he's got any increases,<br> he can hand 'em over.<br> If he don't,<br> maybe I'll get a lawyer...<br> and bring in the name<br> of that highfalutin widow!<br> I won't keep ya any longer, Mr. Morley.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Just see the check is mailed to the same<br> place. That's all the benefits I want.<br> This one'll do.<br> Look, put some more lace on it...<br> I'm sorry!<br> Nice one.<br> You're wonderful, Laurel.<br> Dick, you threw me<br> that last game.<br> The last one came over like a bullet.<br> Is that any way to treat your teacher?<br> - That's the way to take him over.<br> - What's the matter? Losing your edge?<br> - Laurel, this is Mrs. Clews.<br> - I'm glad to know you.<br> - You're improving rapidly.<br> - My teacher.<br> We're gonna have Dad's box for<br> the polo game. Won't you come with us?<br> Oh, I'd love to.<br> But I should spend<br> the afternoon with my mother.<br> See ya at dinner then. Bye.<br> - How is your mother today?<br> - Oh, she's much better, thank you.<br> Couldn't Mrs. Clews and I visit her<br> this afternoon while you go to the polo?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - That's an idea, Mother.<br> I've been looking forward<br> to meeting her.<br> It's unfortunate<br> she's been ill all the time.<br> - What do you say?<br> - I'll have to ask Mother.<br> - Come on.<br> - All right!<br> - I'll call you.<br> - All right.<br> Hello, darling.<br> - Did you have a good time?<br> - Oh, heavenly.<br> Richard's mother and a Mrs. Clews I<br> just met want me to go to the polo game.<br> And they want to spend<br> the afternoon with you.<br> And see me for the first time<br> in my nightgown? Huh!<br> I should say not. And me<br> with a trunk full of new clothes...<br> my skin is just itchin'<br> to get next to.<br> Goodness gracious. But you go along,<br> and say I was asleep.<br> No, I won't leave you<br> alone again.<br> There's no sense in the two of us<br> being cooped up here.<br> I'll be all right in a few days. I'll<br> get all fixed up and meet your friends.<br> You know what I was thinkin'?<br> The first night I'm able<br> to go down in the dining room...<br> we'll have this Richard<br> and his mother to dinner with us.<br> Would ya like that?<br> I knew you would.<br> Go on, now. Run along.<br> You mustn't keep him waiting.<br> Wear your blue jacket.<br> I love ya in that.<br> Boy. Oh, boy.<br> Listen, will you tell me<br> which lady is Mrs. Richard Grosvenor?<br> Mrs. Grosvenor's<br> not here, ma'am.<br> Oh, then please direct me<br> to the tennis court. Maybe she's there.<br> Just across the lawn<br> and down that path.<br> You mean sort of over that way<br> and down there?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Oh. Wait a minute.<br> - Here you are, young fellow.<br> - Oh, that's all right.<br> - Don't be sill'.<br> - Thank you.<br> Here goes a birdie.<br> - Did I say birdie?<br> - Well, whoo!<br> - Tryin' to cover it up, huh?<br> - No, I'll wear it everywhere.<br> Did you see the makeup on her?<br> And those shoes!<br> Why, I thought<br> she was wearing stilts.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi, kids. How are you?<br> Come on.<br> Move down one seat.<br> Whatever happened to you two?<br> We've been back hours.<br> We took a shortcut.<br> - Say, Paul, you sure missed a show.<br> - What'll it be, Mr. Grosvenor?<br> - What show?<br> - That woman on the tennis court.<br> I'll have a chocolate ice cream soda<br> with chocolate ice cream...<br> and whipped cream on top.<br> - What about her?<br> - Make mine the same...<br> only with vanilla ice cream<br> and leave off the goo.<br> I didn't know they let<br> that kind of woman loose anymore.<br> - Happy?<br> - You should've seen the getup.<br> - What a woman!<br> - Maybe Dick knows her.<br> - Dick, she was looking for your mother.<br> - Yeah?<br> Pete lobbed one over the fence<br> and she started chasing after it.<br> I never saw her before.<br> Who is she?<br> I don't know, but I'd sure like<br> to know where she got that paint job.<br> - It's a Christmas tree, not a woman.<br> - And it walks.<br> - Does it talk?<br> - And how!<br> - Good?<br> - Delicious.<br> That's the one.<br> I heard her say to Jimmy...<br> ''You oughta see<br> my little girl play tennis.''<br> She must have some little girl.<br> - No, I don't like it.<br> - It is rather heavy.<br> - Let me see that one.<br> - This one?<br> - She's an ad.<br> - An ad for what?<br> We'll see in a minute.<br> Wait'll her hat lights up.<br> You're all wrong.<br> It's a trailer.<br> Do you think that one<br> really suits my personality?<br> - Yes, ma'am. Decidedly.<br> - You do.<br> I'll take that.<br> Send it up to Room 214.<br> Thank you.<br> ''Personality.''<br> Amy, get her.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I must've lost my watch.<br> Wait a minute. You can't go<br> all the way back there now.<br> - When did you see it last?<br> - I want to go. Please let me go.<br> Don't worry about it. Let's finish<br> our sodas first. We'll find it.<br> There you are.<br> I've been lookin' all over for you...<br> Well, Lollie, what on earth...<br> - Mother, we're going home.<br> - Home?<br> What are you talking...<br> - What's the matter? What's happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> Oh, I know.<br> My little Lollie's had<br> a quarrel with her young man.<br> Mother, please!<br> Oh, don't be a little goose.<br> I'll tell you what you do.<br> I'll invite him for dinner, make<br> believe I don't know anything about it.<br> I'll pretend you're not back yet.<br> What's their number?<br> I wanna go home.<br> You wanna go home?<br> Well... Well, what about me?<br> Payin' for two rooms all this time<br> and usin' only a bed.<br> Don't you think I'd like a little<br> of the fun you've been havin'?<br> I should think you'd think<br> of somebody else besides yourself.<br> You know...<br> I like nice people<br> and a little fun myself.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't see how your pride would let you<br> show him you cared that much.<br> If it was me, I'd stay on just to show<br> him that there's other fish in the sea.<br> It's only for you.<br> Well, you said yourself<br> this morning...<br> you'd never been<br> so happy in all your life.<br> And so was I too.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Here.<br> Here you are, miss.<br> Thank you.<br> Board!<br> - She missed it as sure as you live.<br> - Oh, there she is.<br> Nan! Did you have a blowout?<br> No, but just as I was leaving,<br> I met Ethel. Oh, I can't get my breath.<br> Here, sit down.<br> I want to tell you what Ethel told me.<br> You remember that funny-looking woman<br> parading around this afternoon?<br> - No, I didn't see her.<br> - You didn't see her?<br> She can't be described.<br> You wouldn't believe it.<br> I'll tell you, she was quite a number.<br> Her dress was up to here.<br> And paint an inch thick.<br> And bells on her shoes that tinkled...<br> - Oh, not bells!<br> - And bracelets up to here that clanked.<br> You never saw such a sight.<br> Anyway, do you know who she was?<br> - Who?<br> - Laurel Dallas's mother.<br> Laurel Dallas!<br> Oh, I can't believe it!<br> You mean that pretty little girl<br> Dick Grosvenor's been rushing?<br> Yes. Didn't you know her?<br> But are you sure?<br> She seemed so lovely and sweet.<br> Isn't it weird? To have such<br> a common-looking creature for a mother?<br> - Poor thing.<br> - Poor nothing.<br> She's wearing<br> Dick Grosvenor's fraternity pin.<br> - She won't be wearing it long.<br> - Not when Mrs. Grosvenor hears about it.<br> - Your berths are ready, ladies.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I want to tell you about...<br> - Ethel made it so interesting and funny.<br> - Lollie.<br> - It's lonely up there, Mother.<br> I want to come down here<br> and cuddle with you.<br> I'd... I'd like<br> to see Mrs. Morrison.<br> - Was it in reference to...<br> - I couldn't say. It's private.<br> I'd have to see Mrs. Morrison.<br> - What was the name, please?<br> - Mrs. Dallas.<br> Mrs. Stephen Dallas.<br> Yes.<br> I will see if Mrs. Morrison is at home.<br> Come with me, please.<br> - Just wait in there, please.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you Mrs. Morrison?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry to bother you<br> in your home, but l...<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - What I have to say won't take long.<br> - It's just that...<br> - Oh, we may as well be comfortable.<br> It's so very warm.<br> Won't you take off your coat?<br> I know you must think it's funny,<br> me comin' here like this.<br> I'm not gonna beat<br> around the bush, but...<br> what I wanna know is<br> if Stephen was free...<br> if I got a divorce<br> like his lawyer wanted, would...<br> would you two get married?<br> Yes, we would.<br> I'm sorry if it's unpleasant, but...<br> - I'd rather that you knew the truth.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, what I wanted to know is...<br> if you and Stephen<br> did get married...<br> well, what about Laurel?<br> - Would ya take her too?<br> - Oh, no, Mrs. Dallas.<br> I'm a mother.<br> Do you think I could ever deprive<br> another mother of her own little girl?<br> Yeah, but if the mother<br> didn't want her...<br> I mean, if she<br> couldn't very well have her.<br> - If it was inconvenient.<br> - Inconvenient?<br> Yeah. You see...<br> Lollie's growing up now,<br> and she...<br> well, she's quite<br> a responsibility.<br> Oh, I don't understand.<br> Well, you see, it's this way.<br> From now on, there's lots of things<br> Lollie ought to begin having.<br> I don't mean money, but...<br> dances and parties, you know.<br> Good times, and really I've never been<br> much at that sort of thing.<br> So I feel that I've done<br> about all I can for her.<br> I thought that you being<br> so crazy about her father...<br> and she takin' after him so much<br> that...<br> well, if you and Stephen<br> got married...<br> why, Lollie could come<br> and live with you.<br> And your name bein'<br> Mrs. Dallas, you see...<br> everybody would naturally<br> think she was...<br> your little girl.<br> Then when ya went places,<br> you see...<br> well...<br> You see, you're<br> the kind of a mother...<br> that any girl would be proud of.<br> I didn't know anyone<br> could be so unselfish.<br> And I'll say one thing. You'd never<br> be ashamed of Lollie either.<br> Everybody's just crazy about her.<br> Oh, she makes a wonderful impression.<br> She's so refined<br> and elegant in her ways, but...<br> Oh, you already know that.<br> Anyway, she'd...<br> Well, anyway, she's...<br> Well, she's crazy<br> about you already.<br> She don't talk as much<br> as she used to, but...<br> that's because she thinks<br> I'm jealous or something, and l...<br> Oh, I guess I was a little,<br> but I'm not anymore.<br> And you'll see.<br> In a little while, she'll...<br> Well...<br> in a little while,<br> she'll forget all about me.<br> And it won't be any time<br> before she'll...<br> She'll love you just...<br> just like you were<br> her real mother.<br> And Mrs. Morrison,<br> she's so wonderful. You don't know.<br> I do know.<br> And I know it hasn't come<br> only from her father.<br> I have to go.<br> Lollie doesn't know<br> I've come here, and l...<br> I don't want her to yet.<br> She's awful funny underneath.<br> And I thought it all out.<br> It'll be better...<br> to just let her come<br> for the visit like always...<br> and by that time,<br> it'll all be over.<br> The divorce, I mean.<br> And then...<br> Then you can<br> break it to her.<br> It'll be easier that way.<br> - Board!<br> - Good-bye, darling.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Go on. Get inside.<br> - Good-bye, Mother.<br> - Good-bye, dear.<br> - You'll write to me, won't you?<br> - Oh, yes, I will.<br> Now have a nice time,<br> and don't think about me.<br> Wear your new blue dress tonight.<br> I wanna see ya in my mind's eye.<br> All right. Bye!<br> I love you!<br> Good-bye!<br> Good-bye, Mother!<br> - It's a lot of fun, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Haven't you ever played it before?<br> - No, I haven't.<br> John wouldn't go to bed<br> until I promised to bring these in...<br> so you'd still have some family<br> to keep you company tonight.<br> - How sweet.<br> - Oh, that John.<br> - And here's their breakfast.<br> - Gosh! You sure stand high with John.<br> He won't let Lee and me<br> see 'em, let alone feed 'em.<br> I suppose it's time young men removed<br> themselves from ladies' boudoirs.<br> - Okay, Dad.<br> - Good night, sweetheart.<br> - Good night, darling, and sleep well.<br> - I will, thank you.<br> Good night, Laurel.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> - Good night, Mother.<br> - I'll put these in a safe place.<br> Oh, I never saw Father<br> so happy before.<br> And you, dear,<br> are you happy?<br> So very, for you both.<br> But...<br> I've been worrying<br> and worrying about something.<br> Why, what could possibly<br> be worrying you?<br> Well, I don't know<br> what to call you.<br> Oh, if that's all.<br> I'm so glad, because I<br> have something to tell you...<br> which I hope will make you<br> just as happy as it has me.<br> From now on, you're going<br> to be one of us really, dear.<br> You're going to be a member of this<br> family like Con and Lee and John.<br> They're your brothers,<br> and this is going to be your home...<br> as much as it is theirs.<br> - This my home?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> You're going to live with us.<br> - Live here?<br> - Here, the town house, wherever we are.<br> Does it make you happy, Laurel?<br> Oh, yes, it makes me very happy...<br> to know that you want me,<br> and I do love you all so very much.<br> But I couldn't leave my mother.<br> Oh, you won't be leaving her.<br> Your mother will always<br> be your mother.<br> I could never expect or even want<br> to take her place in your heart.<br> - You'll visit her whenever you like.<br> - No, I couldn't.<br> Oh, thank you ever and ever<br> so much, Mrs... I mean...<br> Laurel, your mother, your father,<br> all of us who love you...<br> feel that now that<br> you're getting older...<br> there are many advantages<br> that we can give you.<br> I know.<br> And I do thank you.<br> But I'm sorry.<br> - Good night, Con.<br> - Good night, Dad.<br> Yes, dear?<br> What is it, dear?<br> You don't mean you thought<br> that I could live...<br> anywhere ever without Mother.<br> Well, you've lived without me.<br> Your mother and I are just<br> changing places for a while, that's all.<br> Isn't it fair for me to have a little<br> of what she's had all these years?<br> But that's different, Father.<br> You know it is.<br> I've been with Mother all these years<br> because I needed her.<br> Now she needs me,<br> and you need me less than ever.<br> Oh, Laurel, don't say that.<br> I'm sorry if you don't see that<br> what we've planned is for your good.<br> We thought it would make you happy.<br> Your mother and I have decided upon<br> what we think is best for you.<br> - My mother? Does she know?<br> - Certainly.<br> We have your interests<br> equally at heart, haven't we?<br> We both feel that this should be<br> your home for at least a few years.<br> I'm sorry, Father,<br> but please understand.<br> My home will be with my mother<br> as long as I live.<br> Oh, Stephen.<br> Laurel, you don't understand, dear.<br> This was all your mother's idea.<br> Her wish for you.<br> She planned it all herself.<br> Your father had<br> nothing to do with it.<br> She came to see me,<br> and we talked it all over.<br> - She came to you? When?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> Was it just after we got back<br> from the Mirador?<br> Why, I believe it was, but...<br> Oh, my poor mother.<br> My wonderful mother.<br> Oh, she wasn't asleep.<br> She heard what they said.<br> Oh, I must go to her.<br> I must go to her at once!<br> - Darling, tell us about it.<br> - Oh, please, Daddy.<br> Help me. I can't make my visit here.<br> I must go to my mother!<br> Sure you can see him.<br> That ain't meanin' that he can see you.<br> Hey, Munn.<br> Somebody to see ya.<br> Ed.<br> Ed, wake up.<br> It's Stella.<br> Ed, it's me,<br> Stella Dallas.<br> Hello, Stell.<br> Look, I still live<br> in the same old flat.<br> I want you to take this, get a Turkish<br> bath and shave and come right over.<br> Ed, do ya understand?<br> Sure. I got it.<br> Mommy!<br> Lollie! When did you...<br> Well, whatever brought you back?<br> Mother, how could you think...<br> As if I could ever live<br> anywhere else but with you.<br> Well, I thought you'd like it<br> for a while. No, really, you...<br> You always seem to have<br> such a good time with your father.<br> Yes, but good times aren't...<br> Oh, they aren't<br> what make you belong.<br> It's other kind of times.<br> It's when you've<br> cried together...<br> and when you've been<br> through things together.<br> That's when you seem<br> to love the most.<br> It's different when you...<br> Didn't they send a telegram?<br> They said they would.<br> Most likely they tried to deliver it<br> and I was out. I've been on the go.<br> - Put those in water for me, will ya?<br> - Oh, they're lovely.<br> From an old admirer.<br> Ed Munn blew into town.<br> - I've been steppin' out with him.<br> - Ed Munn?<br> Yeah. Now put 'em in water.<br> I want 'em all fixed nice<br> when he gets here.<br> - Mother, you don't mean that you and...<br> - Haven't you fixed 'em yet?<br> Give 'em to me.<br> Get some water.<br> There.<br> That'll tickle him.<br> Don't you remember<br> a long time ago we said...<br> - And you promised about him...<br> - I know what you're driving at.<br> Now let me tell you something. I've<br> spent the best years of my life on you.<br> A woman wants to be something else<br> besides a mother, you know.<br> Well, you will know<br> when you get grown up.<br> You can't explain<br> everything to a child.<br> Now, go on. Run along.<br> I've come back to stay,<br> if you still want me.<br> - Still want you?<br> - Laurel, my dear.<br> Tell me, dear.<br> What is it, angel? What is it?<br> Oh, Daddy!<br> What is it, sweetheart?<br> I thought it was for my sake...<br> she wanted me to come<br> and live with you...<br> and I was so glad and so proud.<br> But it wasn't.<br> It was for him.<br> She wanted to marry him!<br> - Please don't cry.<br> - You knew him.<br> - Yes, I know him.<br> - And she chose him!<br> Oh, Laurel,<br> come upstairs with me, dear.<br> All right.<br> So long.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Well, hello!<br> You back? Gee, that's great.<br> Who do you think brought me home?<br> Dick Grosvenor.<br> We were just talkin' about you. I'll<br> get him. He's still in the driveway.<br> Oh, no, Con!<br> - I don't want to see him, not now.<br> - Now, now.<br> Oh, no...<br> No, not yet.<br> Go on upstairs, dear.<br> We'll take care of Dick.<br> Hey, Dick!<br> Come on back!<br> Laurel's here.<br> - When did she get back?<br> - She was here when I got here.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Dallas?<br> - Hello, Dick.<br> - I'm glad to see you again.<br> - I'm glad to see you.<br> Con told me Laurel was here.<br> - All right, fella, that's one on me.<br> - No, she's here!<br> - Hey, Laurel's here, isn't she?<br> - Yes. Won't you stay for dinner?<br> Why, if I'm all right as I am.<br> - Of course.<br> - Lf you don't mind, I'd like to wash up.<br> - Come on up to my room.<br> - Hurry up.<br> Okay, Dad.<br> Stephen, Laurel is here.<br> She's here to stay.<br> Who's accomplished it?<br> Couldn't you read between<br> those pitiful lines?<br> I told you those curtains<br> weren't to be drawn.<br> Open them, please.<br> Yes, madam.<br> Yes.<br> Now you must light the candles,<br> and we must hurry.<br> Yes, madam.<br> Come, dear.<br> It's nearly time for our cue.<br> What's this?<br> Oh, my darling.<br> I was just thinking.<br> I never really thought<br> that my mother...<br> I thought that she would<br> read about the wedding and...<br> even though she was too far away<br> to come, at least she would write to me.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> Do you think if she knew...<br> any distance in the world<br> could keep her away?<br> Then you think<br> she just doesn't know.<br> Sorry, but you can't stand here.<br> We have to keep this clear.<br> Move along, please.<br> Break up the group here.<br> - You too, lady.<br> - Please, let me see her face...<br> when he kisses her.<br> All right, folks.<br> You've seen enough. Come on.<br> Move along, please.<br> Come on. Clear the sidewalk.<br>
