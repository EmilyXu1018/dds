                        MAN #1: And with that movie 2001,<br> you're projecting us into the 21st century.<br> - I brought along my son Jonathan...<br> - MAN #2: Hi.<br> who in the year 2001 will<br> be the same age as I am now.<br> Maybe he will be better adjusted to this<br> kind of world that you're trying to portray.<br> MAN #2: The big difference,<br> when he grows up...<br> In fact, if we wanted to<br> wait till the year 2001...<br> He will have in his own house<br> not a computer as big as<br> this, but at least a console<br> through which he can talk to<br> his friendly local computer<br> and get all the information<br> he needs for his everyday life,<br> like his bank statements,<br> his theater reservations,<br> all the information you need in the course<br> of living in a complex modern society.<br> This will be in a compact<br> form in his own house.<br> He'll have a television screen,<br> like these here, and a keyboard.<br> And he'll talk to the computer<br> and get information from it.<br> And he'll take it as much for<br> granted as we take the telephone.<br> MAN #1: I wonder, though, what sort of<br> a life would it be like in social terms?<br> I mean, if our whole life<br> is built around the computer,<br> do we become a computer-dependent society?<br> In some ways, but they<br> will also enrich our society<br> because it will make it possible for<br> us to live, really, anywhere we like.<br> Any businessman and executive<br> could live almost anywhere on Earth<br> and still do his business<br> through a device like this.<br> And this is a wonderful thing. It means<br> we won't have to be stuck in cities.<br> We'll be able to live out in the<br> country or wherever we please.<br> MAN #3: Screen says it's<br> an unimplemented trap.<br> But the error code is<br> wrong. It's a system error.<br> - WOMAN: So what's the upshot?<br> - MAN #3: It's not gonna say hello.<br> MAN #4: It absolutely<br> is gonna say hello.<br> - It's nobody's fault. It's a system error.<br> - You built the voice demo.<br> - The voice demo is flaky.<br> - Keep your voices down.<br> I've been telling you that<br> for... This thing is overbuilt.<br> It worked last night. It<br> worked the night before that.<br> It worked three hours ago.<br> - It's not working now, so just skip over the voice demo.<br> - Fuck you.<br> - Everything else is working.<br> - Shh.<br> Skip over the voice demo.<br> We need it to say hello.<br> - You're not hearing me. It's not going to say hello.<br> - Just fix it.<br> - Fix it?<br> - Yeah.<br> (scoffing)<br> - In 40 minutes?<br> - Fix it.<br> - I can't.<br> - Who's the person who can?<br> I'm the person who can, and I can't.<br> - How bad are you saying?<br> - It's pretty bad.<br> - I don't know what that means.<br> - It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash.<br> You have to keep your voices down.<br> Joel Pforzheimer is<br> sitting out in the house.<br> I don't care if... Who's Joel Pforzheimer?<br> GQ.<br> He's been shadowing you<br> for a week. Did you notice?<br> Just look like everything's fine.<br> He's sitting out in the house.<br> Hey.<br> What are you guys saying?<br> Some kind of race condition, but we<br> haven't been able to track it down yet.<br> Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough?<br> No, so the rates are off<br> and it keeps crashing.<br> WOMAN: It's 20 seconds out of a<br> two-hour launch. Why not just cut it?<br> - We can't cut it.<br> - Yeah, you just cut it.<br> Two days ago, we ran a Super Bowl ad that<br> could've won the Oscar for Best Short Film.<br> There are more people who can tell you about<br> the ad than can tell you who won the game.<br> I understand, but the ad said<br> the Mac was gonna save the world.<br> It didn't say it was gonna say hello.<br> WOMAN #2: We open the house in five.<br> Don't open the house.<br> We're taking a quick break.<br> - Part of the problem is...<br> - What?<br> We can recompile, but if it's a hardware<br> problem, we can't get into the back.<br> Why not?<br> - Do you wanna tell her or should I?<br> - Don't start with me, man.<br> - Why can't he get into the machine?<br> - You need special tools.<br> What kind of special tools?<br> Just take a screwdriver.<br> He didn't want users to be able to open it.<br> You need special tools.<br> (whispers) Is this for real?<br> There are a hundred engineers walking<br> around here. None of them have the tools?<br> In fairness, not many of<br> them were issued the tools.<br> - What about you?<br> - I left them at the office. It was 3:00 AM when I...<br> Oh, Jesus Christ.<br> - Cut "Hello."<br> - No.<br> - What's the first rule of a launch?<br> - It's not gonna crash.<br> It just did.<br> Andy!<br> Which one?<br> The other Andy. You're right<br> there. Why would I be calling out?<br> - He needs to talk to you.<br> - Yeah.<br> The exit signs need to be off or<br> we're not gonna get a full blackout.<br> - We've spoken to the building manager and the fire marshal.<br> - And?<br> There's no way they're gonna<br> let us turn the exit signs off.<br> - (snaps fingers)<br> - I'll pay whatever the fine is.<br> The fine is they're gonna come<br> in and tell everyone to leave.<br> You explained to the fire marshal<br> that we're in here changing the world?<br> I did, but unless we can also change<br> the properties of fire, he doesn't care.<br> - Steve...<br> - If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits,<br> it'll have been well worth<br> it for those who survive.<br> For those who don't, less<br> so, but still pretty good.<br> - Look, I...<br> - I need it to go black. Real black.<br> Get rid of the exit signs and<br> don't let me know how you did it.<br> Fix the voice demo.<br> You need special tools to open the Mac?<br> You knew it was a closed system.<br> I didn't know literally. Jesus.<br> And if you keep alienating<br> people for no reason,<br> there's gonna be no one<br> left for it to say hello to.<br> It's not for no reason.<br> We blow this and IBM will own the<br> next 50 years like a Batman villain.<br> Remember the phone company? That's what<br> Bell was called, "the phone company."<br> IBM will be the computer company.<br> Ten years later they'll<br> be the information company,<br> and that's very bad for the human race.<br> So we don't have time to<br> be polite or realistic,<br> 'cause if we are, this<br> company's next product launch<br> will be held in front of 26 people<br> and a stringer from the<br> Alameda County Shopper's Guide.<br> We haven't advertised the voice software.<br> We could pull it out of the demo<br> and no one would be disappointed.<br> Do you want to try being reasonable,<br> just, you know, see what it feels like?<br> Okay. Pull the voice demo.<br> Thank you.<br> And then cancel the launch.<br> I see. You just tricked me a little.<br> You can tell me how unimportant it is,<br> but if the computer doesn't say hello,<br> then neither will John Sculley,<br> who I promise you agrees with me.<br> Sculley's not gonna cancel the<br> launch 'cause he's not insane.<br> He's also not a hack, and<br> when it comes to the Macintosh,<br> he's gonna do what I ask him to do.<br> - What's in this box?<br> - Nothing you need to worry about.<br> Don't even open it.<br> What the fuck?<br> Why is there a carton of... Who did this?<br> - Somebody thought...<br> - Who?<br> Doesn't matter. Thought it would be a good<br> idea to have copies of that Time cover<br> available at everyone's seat.<br> It was nipped in the bud and all the<br> copies are being taken out of the building.<br> So problem solved.<br> - This isn't a Macintosh.<br> - I understand.<br> Somebody thought it would<br> be a good idea to, like,<br> enthusiastically hand over copies of<br> Time with a not-a-Macintosh on the cover<br> at the launch of the Macintosh?<br> What are they handing<br> out at Hewlett-Packard?<br> A bushel of apples with my face on them?<br> I'm sure the thinking was that<br> since the computer is Man of the Year<br> that that's good for our business,<br> but like I said, I'm having<br> them removed from the building.<br> What I'd like you to do with them<br> is to take them, all 2,600 copies,<br> and stack them on Kottke's desk<br> and tell him Steve says,<br> "Happy New Year to you."<br> Okay.<br> I gave Time magazine full access.<br> The whole campus: Bandley, Apple II, Lisa.<br> I gave him Sculley, Markkula. I<br> gave him Woz. I gave him everybody.<br> What should I call the person who thought<br> it'd be a good idea to hand these out?<br> I'm not telling you who it was.<br> It was done without malice.<br> It's been taken care of.<br> You have a half hour and we<br> have things to talk about.<br> Like what?<br> (sighs) Like a million<br> in the first 90 days.<br> - Joanna...<br> - 20,000 a month after that.<br> - Look. Those are the forecasts.<br> - I'm begging...<br> This is my field. I'm begging you<br> to manage expectations out there.<br> - I'm fanning expectations.<br> - We're not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days.<br> Everyone, everyone, everyone,<br> everyone is waiting for the Mac.<br> Maybe.<br> But what happens when they<br> find out that for 2,495,<br> there's nothing you can do with it?<br> We were competitive at $1,500,<br> but once you replaced the<br> Motorola 6809 with the 68000...<br> Which is what supports menus, windows,<br> point and click, high-res graphics...<br> Yeah, 'cause everyone needs<br> rectangles with rounded corners.<br> Coach lands on the runway at the<br> exact same time as first class.<br> I don't have the first<br> fucking idea what that means,<br> but this is how it got to $2,500,<br> which is the price point on<br> the PC, which can do a lot more!<br> Who's gonna want a PC?<br> What idiot is gonna want...<br> If I wanna tell you there's a spot<br> on your shirt, I point to the spot.<br> I don't say there's a spot 14<br> centimeters down from the collar<br> and three centimeters to the<br> right of the second button<br> while I try to remember what<br> the command is for club soda.<br> That's not how a person's mind works.<br> If the goal was ease of use, maybe<br> you should've given it some memory.<br> You can complain about memory<br> or you can complain about price,<br> but you can't do both at the same time.<br> Memory is what costs money.<br> I'm glad you're telling me<br> your feelings about the Mac now<br> because we have a half hour left.<br> We can redesign it.<br> I'm just asking you to manage expectations.<br> Look at their faces<br> when they see what it is.<br> They won't know what they're<br> looking at or why they like it,<br> but they'll know they want it.<br> Not instantly. When people<br> heard Rite of Spring,<br> they tore the chairs out of the theater.<br> They didn't buy the record.<br> Rite of Spring happens<br> to be the most revolutionary<br> and provocative symphony<br> of the last century.<br> Ballet. It was a ballet.<br> But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he<br> was gonna sell 20,000 units a month.<br> I don't know why we're<br> talking about Stravinsky<br> when what I care about is Dan Kottke<br> sodomizing me in Time magazine.<br> (sighs) Look. Obviously...<br> Let me say this to you.<br> Obviously, Daniel didn't think<br> he was doing anything wrong.<br> - By talking to Time about it?<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't know what that means.<br> You said, when you told me the story...<br> You said you said to Dan,<br> "Did Time magazine ask you<br> if I had a daughter named Lisa?"<br> And Dan said, "Yeah."<br> My point was that he answered<br> you simply and honestly<br> because he didn't think<br> he'd done anything wrong.<br> Except, Joanna... Except I<br> don't have a daughter named Lisa.<br> And this story is now about how I'm<br> denying paternity and took a blood test.<br> And that's why there's a picture of...<br> I don't know what the fuck that is.<br> That's why there's a<br> picture of a PC on the cover<br> instead of a picture of me and the Mac.<br> I don't know what to tell you.<br> I was supposed to be Time<br> magazine's Man of the Year.<br> And then Dan Kottke was born.<br> - Well...<br> - What?<br> - She's waiting for you.<br> - Who?<br> - Chrisann.<br> - Brennan?<br> They're out in the hall.<br> They've been sitting in the back of<br> the auditorium since 7:00 this morning.<br> I'm not having a session<br> with Chrisann right now.<br> We issued 335 press<br> credentials for the launch.<br> Steve, you piss off Chrisann,<br> she's gonna stand in the<br> lobby and give 335 interviews,<br> and you, pal, will be longing for<br> the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.<br> (sighs) Let me get this over with.<br> But don't leave. You're gonna stay here.<br> What? No. I'm not.<br> No. There's less of a chance of a<br> scene if you stay here. She'll be cool.<br> (exhales) I find all this<br> excruciatingly personal and-and...<br> I-I'm... I'm not staying.<br> No. Come on.<br> I don't wanna be in a<br> room alone with Chrisann.<br> This is me and you.<br> Fine.<br> Hey.<br> Steve.<br> This is a surprise.<br> Why don't you come on in?<br> Thank you.<br> - You coming too?<br> - Yes, I'm not gonna leave her in the hallway.<br> Okay. It's a safe hallway, but anyway.<br> You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's<br> the head of marketing for the Mac.<br> Good to see you.<br> Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa.<br> We've met before, and you told<br> me you like the way I talk,<br> and that was my favorite<br> thing anyone's ever said to me.<br> - You're from Poland.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Do you know where that is?<br> - The top of the Earth.<br> I think you're thinking of the North Pole.<br> Well, we're a little<br> pressed for time, so...<br> - I'll leave you guys alone.<br> - Why do you wanna leave when you just said...<br> I'm gonna check in with Hertzfeld.<br> We're trying to get a<br> computer to say hello,<br> but right now it's being very shy.<br> Would you come help me? Is that okay?<br> Sure.<br> STEVE: Thank you.<br> My dad named a computer after me.<br> I'm not your...<br> Actually, do you know what<br> a coincidence is, Lisa?<br> No.<br> Like if you met someone.<br> You made a new friend<br> and her name was Lisa too.<br> That would be a coincidence.<br> "Lisa" stands for "Local<br> Integrated Systems Architecture."<br> L-I-S-A.<br> It's a coincidence.<br> - You about done?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> Come. Let's make that computer say hi.<br> Go ahead, Lisa.<br> So it was the other way around.<br> I was named after the computer?<br> Nothing was named after<br> anybody. It's a coincidence.<br> Come on.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What's the matter with you? Why<br> are you telling her these things?<br> Why are you still telling<br> her I'm her father?<br> - A judge told her you're her father.<br> - No, he didn't.<br> Where the hell do you get off<br> telling Time magazine<br> I've slept with 28 percent<br> of the men in America?<br> - That's not...<br> - Where do you get off?<br> That's not remotely what I said.<br> It's right here. (exhales)<br> First of all, can I tell you<br> something about Time magazine?<br> I believe it's a training<br> facility for paid assassins.<br> - "Jobs insists"... I am quoting...<br> - I didn't invent math.<br> CHRISANN: "...twenty-eight percent of<br> the male population of the United States<br> could be the father."<br> I wasn't saying you've slept<br> with 28% of American men.<br> I was using an algorithm<br> based on the blood test<br> which said there was a 94.1%<br> chance that I'm the father.<br> You're trying to publicly<br> paint me as a slut and a whore.<br> Believe me, I'm not trying to<br> publicly do anything with you.<br> Two million people read<br> Time. How am I supposed...<br> It would be more if they put me on the cover,<br> but Dan Kottke decided to kidney-punch me...<br> - I applied for welfare yesterday.<br> - STEVE: I'm sorry?<br> - Hello!<br> - I said I applied for welfare yesterday.<br> The Time article said your<br> Apple stock was worth $441 million,<br> and I wanted to ask you<br> how you felt about that.<br> Well, I feel like Apple stock<br> has been dramatically undervalued.<br> This would be a good time to get in.<br> Your daughter and her mother...<br> - Chrisann...<br> - are on welfare.<br> We're living in a hovel in Menlo Park.<br> We can't pay the heating bills.<br> She sleeps in a parka.<br> - Your daughter...<br> - She's not my daughter!<br> Because, as reported<br> by Time magazine,<br> - I've slept with 28% of the men in America?<br> - No.<br> All of them, exactly nine<br> months before Lisa was born.<br> - (knocks)<br> - (door opens)<br> I've got Andy here.<br> (door closes)<br> Excuse me.<br> We're there?<br> - Hey, Chris.<br> - CHRISANN: Hey, Andy.<br> - How are you doin'?<br> - Terrible.<br> STEVE: You guys caught up now?<br> Excuse me for saying hello to my<br> friend, who thinks you're a dick.<br> - I don't think you're a...<br> - We're there?<br> - No. It's got a one-in-six chance of working.<br> - Goddamn it.<br> Well, we're not a pit crew at Daytona.<br> This can't be fixed in seconds.<br> You didn't have seconds.<br> You had three weeks.<br> The universe was created<br> in a third of that time.<br> Well, someday you'll have<br> to tell us how you did it.<br> (chuckles)<br> Here's what I'm gonna do.<br> I'm gonna announce the names of<br> everyone who designed the launch demo.<br> I'm gonna introduce everyone<br> and ask them to stand up.<br> The bag was designed by Susan Kare.<br> The Macintosh font that's scrolling across<br> the screen was designed by Steve Capps.<br> The starry night and<br> skywriting was Bruce Horn.<br> MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice,<br> down to the calculator.<br> And then I'm gonna say the<br> voice demo that didn't work<br> was designed by Andy Hertzfeld.<br> (chuckles)<br> Steve...<br> Five-in-six is your chance of surviving<br> the first round of Russian roulette,<br> and you've reversed those odds.<br> So unless you wanna be disgraced<br> in front of your friends,<br> family, colleagues,<br> stockholders and the press,<br> I wouldn't stand here arguing.<br> I'd go try and get some<br> more bullets out of the gun.<br> Do it, Andy!<br> Stop. You.<br> - What size shirt do you wear?<br> - Me?<br> Does anyone know what size shirt<br> he wears? What size shirt I wear?<br> JOANNA: Does anyone know where<br> the closest psychiatrist is?<br> The disk fits in your pocket.<br> I need a shirt with a breast<br> pocket. I can take it out onstage.<br> - A shirt?<br> - The disk!<br> I need a white shirt in my<br> size with a breast pocket.<br> Yes. Which one of the no<br> stores that are open at 8:45<br> do you want me to have someone run<br> to and return from in 15 minutes?<br> Go out in the lobby, find someone<br> my size who's wearing a white shirt.<br> Tell them I'll trade<br> them for a free computer,<br> and they get to keep my shirt.<br> Does it have to be a<br> white shirt? Is blue okay?<br> No. The Mac is beige, I'm beige, the<br> disk is blue, the shirt has to be white.<br> Andy?<br> (exhales)<br> (clicks tongue)<br> STEVE (imitating computer):<br> Hello, I'm Macintosh.<br> Bring me the head of Andy Hertzfeld.<br> I tried to get it to<br> say hello, but it's shy.<br> Yeah.<br> So that's it?<br> STEVE: That's it.<br> I don't get it.<br> I know.<br> What are people going to do with it?<br> Lisa, how old are you now?<br> - You know how old she is.<br> - How old are you, Lisa?<br> Five.<br> Come sit here for a minute.<br> Do you know what this is?<br> - It's a computer.<br> - It's a computer.<br> Can I borrow your hand for a second?<br> Point that arrow and click.<br> You don't have to, but if you<br> want, you can play with it.<br> Nothing you can do will break it,<br> so just do whatever you want with it.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm paying you exactly what<br> the court ordered me to pay you.<br> $385 a month.<br> I'm not the one who decided on that amount.<br> And I'm asking you how you feel.<br> If you feel all right.<br> - If it feels all right to you that your daughter...<br> - She's not my...<br> That your daughter and<br> her mother are on welfare<br> while you're worth $441<br> million for making that.<br> I'm proud to say Apple donates<br> computers to underfunded schools,<br> - and we'll be doing more of the same with the Mac...<br> - What?<br> Apple donates millions of dollars'<br> worth of computers to schools.<br> What does that have to do with...<br> Imagine an underprivileged kid that has<br> their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.<br> We're minutes away from<br> being able to do that.<br> In your head, was that<br> an answer to my question?<br> Tell me the question again.<br> (scoffs)<br> I wasn't the one who sued<br> you for child support.<br> - No, let...<br> - San Mateo County sued you.<br> No, let me explain what happened,<br> 'cause I have plenty of time right now.<br> - (knocks)<br> - (door opens)<br> Excuse me. You have a visitor.<br> Just wanted to say good<br> luck. Hey, Chrisann.<br> - Hello, Woz.<br> - Hang on.<br> (clears throat, groans)<br> - Just wanted to say good luck.<br> - Thanks. You too.<br> - It's a big morning.<br> - Yeah.<br> You should see this crowd out there.<br> This crowd, it's like, um...<br> I can't really wait for you to<br> come up with a metaphor, man.<br> - Yeah. So, listen, I want to ask you a favor.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Can you acknowledge the Apple II team in your remarks?<br> - I cannot.<br> Just an acknowledgement.<br> Have them stand up.<br> - We're launching the Mac.<br> - It'd be a morale booster.<br> Just a mention so they could<br> get a round of applause.<br> - Just a mention.<br> - Can we stick a pin in this for a minute?<br> - Sure.<br> - Thank you.<br> Just talking about an<br> acknowledgement for the team.<br> I've got Chrisann in there.<br> I'll see you in a second.<br> Yep.<br> That.<br> What?<br> You asked me what people are gonna<br> do with it. They're gonna do that.<br> (knocks)<br> One of the engineers.<br> Thank you.<br> Do you like it?<br> I'm sorry?<br> It's an abstract.<br> (chuckles) You used MacPaint.<br> Push that key and the "S" at the same time.<br> - (disk whirring)<br> - (mouse clicks)<br> Now type your name.<br> (typing)<br> Do you know which box says "Save"?<br> Right. Go ahead and click on it.<br> I'll put some money in your account<br> and buy you a new house,<br> someplace near a decent school.<br> Thank you.<br> Woz wants a minute.<br> And Sculley's asking for you.<br> We're done?<br> (scoffs)<br> Could you teach me more things?<br> On the computer?<br> Lisa, wait for me in the hall, please.<br> You can put your coat on in the hall.<br> Bye, Lisa.<br> - Bye.<br> - CHRISANN: Lisa, in the hall. Now.<br> I wanna know, when you say you're<br> gonna put money in my account,<br> how much we're talking about.<br> It's a school day. She<br> needs to be in school.<br> I'm gonna give you whatever you need.<br> (door closes)<br> Woz wants me to acknowledge<br> the Apple II team.<br> You must be able to see<br> that she looks like you.<br> I don't want to insult Woz. I<br> just think it's backward-looking<br> at exactly the wrong moment.<br> - I know you heard what I said.<br> - I heard what you said, Joanna.<br> It's just we're about to do this thing.<br> At 9:41, the planet's gonna shift<br> on its axis nigh and forever.<br> Two most significant<br> events of the 20th century:<br> the Allies win the war and this.<br> This.<br> So maybe right now isn't the<br> very best time to scold me<br> for not being a better father<br> to a kid who's not my kid.<br> - The test said I...<br> - I don't care what the test said.<br> I don't care about 94.1%<br> or the insane algorithm you used<br> to get to 28% of American men.<br> Buying her a new house.<br> I'm giving her money.<br> There's a small girl who<br> believes you're her father.<br> That's all. That's all the math there is.<br> She believes it. What are<br> you gonna do about that?<br> God sent his only son on a suicide mission,<br> but we like him anyway<br> because he made trees.<br> We're gonna sell a million<br> units in the first 90 days.<br> - (sighs)<br> - 20,000 a month after that.<br> So maybe you could give<br> me a break, Ms. Hoffman?<br> (pushes button twice)<br> (elevator bell dings)<br> (breathes deeply)<br> (no audible dialogue)<br> (elevator bell dings)<br> - Woz.<br> - Hey.<br> There's nothing in that vending<br> machine that won't kill you.<br> - Just browsing.<br> - Let's take a walk.<br> - Can I tell you something?<br> - Yeah.<br> After the meeting in Maui, the Apple<br> II team was upset and angry and down.<br> - Do you know why?<br> - Because the Apple II wasn't mentioned even once?<br> The Apple II wasn't mentioned ev...<br> Yes, that's it. You have it. Yes.<br> - That wasn't an oversight.<br> - They know that. They know it wasn't.<br> I don't wanna make a<br> big deal out of this...<br> That's entirely within your power.<br> - The Apple II is...<br> - The Apple II is what was, my friend.<br> The Apple II is what pays the bills<br> around here and has for seven years.<br> And if you embarrass these people,<br> you are going to see a brain<br> drain at this company, my brother.<br> Markkula took you off the Lisa, not<br> them and not me, so don't blame...<br> Markkula took me off the Lisa because of his<br> strong religious objection to making it good.<br> Now I gave you everything<br> you wanted on the Apple II.<br> You don't ask for a lot?<br> There wasn't a single fight you lost.<br> Do you concede the slots are the<br> reason for the success of the Apple II?<br> - We can't still be talking about the slots.<br> - I have a point.<br> It's been seven years. You're still<br> doing it. You're talking about the slots.<br> There's something wrong with you.<br> This argument started in the garage.<br> What are you talking about? Why<br> would you only want two slots?<br> A printer and a modem.<br> With eight slots, you...<br> This is a huge deal that we<br> were able to add eight slots.<br> I appreciate the engineering,<br> but it's not what we're doing.<br> - And thank God I won that argument...<br> - Woz.<br> because the open system is what<br> people love about the machine,<br> and it's why it sold and still sells.<br> An open system. We're<br> not doing an open system.<br> Of course we are. That's what people want,<br> and the breakthrough on the Apple II...<br> People don't know what they<br> want until you show it to them.<br> Serious users want to customize. They<br> wanna modify. They wanna jack it up.<br> They want hardware engineers like<br> me to expand its capabilities, okay?<br> Keyboards for music, better sound board,<br> better display boards,<br> improved memory cards.<br> And it's why there are<br> 3,000 people here right now.<br> The slots are what allowed the Apple II<br> to run, for just one example, VisiCalc,<br> which from my guess single-handedly sold<br> between 200,000 and 300,000 machines.<br> - They want slots.<br> - They don't get a vote.<br> When Dylan wrote "Shelter from the Storm," he<br> didn't ask people to contribute to the lyrics.<br> Plays don't stop so the<br> playwright can ask the audience<br> what scene they'd like to see next.<br> - Painters...<br> - Hobbyists...<br> We're on the verge of<br> a tectonic... Hobbyists?<br> A printer and a modem. Two slots.<br> The Apple II team has my affection,<br> but I'm not loving up a seven-year-old<br> product at the Mac launch.<br> - Computers aren't paintings.<br> - Fuck you.<br> I'm gonna say "fuck you" every time you<br> say that until you either die or stop.<br> - Steve...<br> - Try it.<br> - Steve.<br> - Say it.<br> - Computers aren't paintings.<br> - Fuck you.<br> Yes, they are, and what<br> I want is a closed system.<br> End-to-end control. Completely<br> incompatible with anything.<br> Computers aren't supposed<br> to have human flaws.<br> I'm not going to build this one with yours.<br> (both) Steve!<br> Hey.<br> Today is about the Macintosh.<br> And the Mac is mine.<br> - I give you that.<br> - Thank you.<br> I give you that. Just publicly<br> acknowledge the Apple II team<br> 'cause it's the right thing to do.<br> We'll know soon enough if you are<br> Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are,<br> but in the meantime, it would be great...<br> In the meantime, the Apple II is done.<br> Seven years. It was a great run.<br> You should go out in the<br> house and take your seat.<br> The Mac is Jef Raskin's.<br> Say it for me.<br> - Computers aren't...<br> - Fuck you.<br> All right.<br> (chattering)<br> Five, six...<br> - We're there?<br> - I need more time.<br> - You can't have it.<br> - 20 minutes.<br> - It's 8:58.<br> - We can start late.<br> Hear me. We're a computer<br> company. We can't start late.<br> - Then I have another idea.<br> - What?<br> It's deceptive and borderline unethical.<br> - I'm listening.<br> - It'll run on the 512.<br> - You tested it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Wait. You're gonna demo a 128 computer on a 512?<br> - Nobody's gonna know.<br> And you think that's<br> borderline unethical?<br> Name my other choices, please.<br> Please. You have to tell me why it's<br> so important for it to say hello.<br> Hollywood. They made<br> computers scary things.<br> See how this reminds you of a friendly<br> face, that the disk slot is a goofy grin?<br> It's warm and it's playful<br> and it needs to say hello.<br> It needs to say hello because it can.<br> (applause grows louder)<br> (scattered screaming)<br> We're not committing fraud.<br> The 512 is gonna ship in under a year.<br> Will you absolve me of your<br> Eastern European disapproval?<br> The computer in 2001 said hello all the<br> time and it still scared the shit out of me.<br> Absolve me.<br> Just for this.<br> And just for now.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome<br> founding board member Mike Markkula.<br> All right. Okay.<br> Go make a dent in the universe, Steven.<br> See you in a couple hours.<br> And I'm going to take us through<br> the formal part of the meeting,<br> the legal part, if you will.<br> STEVE: Thank merciful God.<br> The cavalry's shown up.<br> MAN: I hear you've been worse than usual this<br> morning. I didn't think that was possible.<br> So I've been dispatched<br> as the "Steve Whisperer."<br> This is a '55 Margaux.<br> - It's 9:00 in the morning.<br> - This is a '55 Margaux.<br> (chuckles)<br> Is it my imagination or have<br> you started to dress like me?<br> It was a bad idea to have Markkula<br> open with quarterly reports.<br> Instead we should have just<br> dropped water on the audience.<br> You know, just big 10,000-gallon tanks<br> of cold water, dropped from the ceiling.<br> Save Mike some money on index cards.<br> - Oh, just relax.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know. No one's<br> ever asked me that question.<br> - (chuckles)<br> - There you go.<br> You're the only one who sees<br> the world the same way I do.<br> No one sees the world the same way you do.<br> I'm like Julius Caesar, John.<br> - I'm surrounded by enemies.<br> - No, you're not.<br> - The board...<br> - Oh, the board. The board's behind you.<br> Only because you see to it they are.<br> I think it's a good board,<br> but if you want me to push them out<br> one by one, we can talk about that.<br> I want you to push them out all at once...<br> through a window, if it's the nearest exit.<br> The look on their faces<br> when we showed them the spot.<br> I couldn't see their faces, 'cause they<br> were banging their heads on the table.<br> Yeah, yeah. Yesterday, the<br> day after it airs once,<br> the publisher of Adweek calls<br> it the best commercial of all time.<br> Of all time! And it is.<br> And if anyone does one better, it's gonna be<br> Chiat/Day, who the board wanted to replace,<br> and it's gonna be Lee Clow, who the<br> board thought was out of his mind.<br> MAN #1 (on PA): Ladies<br> and gentlemen, "1984."<br> MAN #2 (on monitor): The<br> first glorious anniversary<br> of the information<br> purification directives.<br> We have created for the<br> first time in all history<br> a garden of pure ideology<br> where each worker may bloom,<br> secure from the pests purveying<br> contradictory thoughts.<br> Our unification of thoughts is more powerful<br> a weapon than any fleet or army on earth.<br> We are one people...<br> Did we use skinheads as extras?<br> - A couple of people have told me that.<br> - Yeah.<br> We paid skinheads? I've<br> got skinheads on my payroll?<br> - They had a look you wanted.<br> - The skinheads?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Okay, let's keep that to ourselves.<br> (grunts)<br> MAN #2: We shall prevail.<br> MALE ANNOUNCER: On January 24th, Apple<br> Computer will introduce Macintosh.<br> - JOHN: Who else knows?<br> - STEVE: Who else knows what?<br> - That we paid terrorists to be in our TV commercial.<br> - John...<br> They were wrong about the ad, but<br> they're a good board. Good people.<br> Their only problem... Their<br> problem is that they're people.<br> People. The very nature of people<br> is something to be overcome.<br> When I was running Pepsi, we had a lot<br> of success focusing on 18-to-55-year-olds<br> - who weren't members of violent hate groups.<br> - I get it.<br> You're not surrounded by enemies.<br> We're almost there.<br> I'm back and forth on the Dylan.<br> I might quote a different verse.<br> JOHN: What are the choices?<br> "For the loser now will be later to win,"<br> - which is what we have.<br> - Mm-hmm. Or?<br> "Come mothers and fathers<br> throughout the land<br> and don't criticize what<br> you can't understand.<br> Your sons and your daughters"...<br> "Are beyond your command."<br> I just lost a hundred<br> bucks to Andy Hertzfeld.<br> He said you'd change it to that verse.<br> We got 45 seconds. I want to<br> use it to ask you a question.<br> Why do people who are adopted feel like<br> they were rejected instead of selected?<br> That came out of nowhere.<br> "Your sons and your daughters<br> are beyond your command.<br> Your old road is rapidly aging."<br> So go fuck yourself, because<br> my name is Steve Jobs,<br> and the times, they are a-changin'.<br> I don't feel rejected.<br> - You're sure?<br> - Very sure.<br> 'Cause it's not like the baby is<br> born and the parents look and say,<br> "Nah, we're not interested in this one."<br> On the other hand, someone did choose you.<br> It's having no control.<br> You find out you were out of the loop<br> when the most crucial events<br> in your life were set in motion.<br> As long as you have control.<br> I don't understand people who give it up.<br> What inspired Hertzfeld to make that bet?<br> He was warning me that being your<br> father figure could be dangerous.<br> Keep your 100 bucks. I'm<br> sticking with the first verse.<br> Good.<br> - What the hell does he mean?<br> - Nothing.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> Thank you, boss.<br> MARKKULA: It's my pleasure to introduce<br> my friend and the CEO of Apple,<br> - John Sculley.<br> - (applause)<br> STEVE: John?<br> Yeah?<br> Lisa made a painting on the Mac.<br> MALE REPORTER #1: The Macintosh,<br> Apple's near mythological home computer,<br> has gotten off to a rocky start in<br> its battle with industry titan IBM.<br> FEMALE REPORTER #1: With sales originally<br> projected to be a million in the first quarter,<br> Apple has sold only 35,000<br> of the user-friendly machines<br> in the months since it's<br> been available to customers.<br> MALE REPORTER #2: The<br> insistence by Steve Jobs<br> that it have what's<br> called end-to-end control,<br> which is a way of saying that it's not compatible<br> with most outside hardware or software,<br> is the Shakespearean flaw in a<br> machine that had potential.<br> MALE REPORTER #3: Apple Computers<br> closed two of its factories today<br> in the wake of disappointing sales.<br> FEMALE REPORTER #2: Do you know how<br> many Macs were sold last month? 500.<br> MALE REPORTER #4: In a move that<br> surprised some but not all on Wall Street,<br> the board of directors of<br> Apple Computers voted today<br> to fire its cofounder Steve Jobs.<br> MALE REPORTER #5: Did he<br> jump or was he pushed?<br> His ex-boss, Apple CEO John<br> Sculley, refused to comment.<br> MALE REPORTER #6: However,<br> in an exclusive interview,<br> Steve Wozniak has slammed the<br> integrity of his old friend Steve Jobs.<br> He calls Jobs an<br> insulting and hurtful guy.<br> FEMALE REPORTER #3: Jobs is hitting back<br> with a new company and a new computer.<br> Apple has a new competitor.<br> Steve Jobs's black cube is<br> aimed at the education market.<br> MALE REPORTER #7: Few people have<br> the ability to make the world wait,<br> but that is just what Jobs is<br> doing with his new company, NeXT.<br> (horse whinnies)<br> STEVE: Focus seems kind of sharp.<br> MAN: On the slide?<br> The floor. The pin spot.<br> I think we want a sharp focus.<br> Don't take it personally. Just<br> not a fan of the circus aesthetic.<br> All right, let's hold here. We're gonna<br> have to go up and refocus the instruments.<br> Just one. The 30 is fine.<br> While we're holding, there are<br> well-wishers in the VIP room.<br> And Woz is here.<br> Steve Wozniak. Yes.<br> (chuckles) Thank you very much.<br> JOANNA: And Andy Hertzfeld.<br> Andy Hertzfeld. Thank you.<br> JOANNA: John Sculley is here too.<br> It's nice that he's here.<br> STEVE: Really? I don't<br> think it's very nice at all.<br> JOANNA: You have to see them.<br> They wanna pay their respects.<br> If they were respectful, we'd<br> all still be at Apple right now.<br> (scoffs) Look...<br> If they really wished me well,<br> they'd keep to themselves.<br> - Can I tell you something?<br> - I don't think they do wish me well.<br> But I'm all right with<br> that. I'm over Apple.<br> I got over the Mac and Woz and Sculley,<br> the same way you get over<br> your high school sweetheart.<br> Build a new one.<br> - Can I tell you something?<br> - Yes.<br> You said you wouldn't compete with them,<br> but you designed a computer<br> specifically for the education market,<br> which they putatively own.<br> So, I think it's cool they're here.<br> - They're suing me.<br> - (elevator bell dings)<br> Still.<br> It was nice they came.<br> They're not being magnanimous.<br> They want it to look<br> like an amicable divorce.<br> History doesn't remember Joe<br> DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn.<br> MAN: Steve?<br> (groans)<br> What's your problem?<br> I don't know, but I'm sure<br> it can be traced back to you.<br> You know, I'm the one who<br> has to explain you to people.<br> $100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo<br> when we didn't even know<br> what our company made.<br> A $650,000 mold for the cube,<br> because God forbid the<br> angles be 90.1 instead of 90.<br> I forbid the angles to<br> be 90.1 instead of 90.<br> That box could be on<br> display at the Guggenheim.<br> Don't give them reason to say to the press<br> you have a chip on your shoulder.<br> Will you do that for me?<br> I don't have a chip on my shoulder.<br> (chuckling) Okay, okay.<br> But don't give them a reason to say you do.<br> I don't.<br> - That's the right attitude.<br> - That's not an attitude.<br> They're gonna call me back in<br> a minute to look at the light.<br> - Get one out of the way.<br> - Fine!<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - One more thing.<br> - Sure.<br> No questions from the press after.<br> No... Why?<br> Until I have better<br> answers, no press avail.<br> Somebody asks where I am, you just<br> saw me, and I'll be right back.<br> Okay.<br> Who do you want first?<br> Bring me the face of Steve Wozniak.<br> - (exhales)<br> - Hang on.<br> - I thought you went to school.<br> - Hang on.<br> You were supposed to go to school<br> an hour ago. I thought you left.<br> I didn't wake up my mom<br> on time this morning.<br> It's happened before too.<br> I wake up with the alarm and then<br> I get dressed and eat breakfast,<br> but sometimes I forget to see<br> what time it is after that.<br> - Why doesn't your mom just set her own alarm clock?<br> - It's one of my chores.<br> I don't understand what that has<br> to do with why you're still...<br> Where's your mother?<br> LISA: She went to find a pay phone.<br> An hour ago, she said...<br> You don't have to raise your hand.<br> - You said it was off by a little.<br> - It is.<br> - I just measured it.<br> - Joanna...<br> Exactly a foot on all four sides.<br> There are six sides.<br> But you're not supposed<br> to be here right now.<br> We know if four of the sides<br> are equal to each other,<br> the other two must be equal as well.<br> The top, bottom, right and left<br> are about a millimeter shorter<br> than the front and back.<br> They're not. I measured them.<br> Lisa, I'm kind of an expert in design.<br> And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think<br> there's a chance it could be off?<br> If I had another ruler, I would measure<br> this ruler, but I really doubt it's off.<br> - When your mother comes back, you have to go to school.<br> - Because it's a ruler!<br> Why is it off?<br> - Did you hear what I just said?<br> - Yes.<br> Because sometimes it seems like<br> you just keep saying what you want<br> without listening.<br> I'm listening.<br> - Is there something you need?<br> - No.<br> Why isn't it a perfect cube?<br> - You've asked me before.<br> - I forget what it is.<br> It's an optical anomaly.<br> To the human eye, a perfect<br> cube doesn't look like a cube,<br> so we made it roughly a millimeter<br> shorter than a foot on two sides.<br> What's an anomaly?<br> You've asked me that before too.<br> I don't know why you keep doing that.<br> It's an exception. Something<br> that doesn't fit a pattern.<br> (knocks)<br> You have to go to school. Come in!<br> (door opens)<br> (chuckles) I think you two have met.<br> Hello, old friend.<br> - You look well.<br> - So do you. So do you.<br> And they're telling me George is<br> ready for you to look at the focus.<br> Take a walk with me.<br> - Is this Lisa?<br> - Yeah.<br> - This can't be Lisa.<br> - It is.<br> - Lisa's this big.<br> - They get taller. Come on.<br> - Do you remember me?<br> - She doesn't.<br> I'm your dad's friend Steve Wozniak.<br> I apologize. I don't remember you.<br> You're very polite. (chuckles)<br> - Woz?<br> - Yeah.<br> STEVE: Chrisann's at a pay<br> phone. Would you find her?<br> JOANNA: Yeah.<br> - (door opens)<br> - STEVE: Good turnout.<br> - WOZNIAK: Great turnout.<br> - Yeah.<br> - "Insanely great." (chuckles)<br> - Insanely great.<br> This is the first time we<br> haven't played for the same team.<br> It's like you're releasing<br> your first solo album.<br> I, uh... I appreciate your<br> inviting me to the launch.<br> I just want to wipe the slate clean.<br> That's exactly what I want.<br> That's why I came backstage.<br> I want you to know, um,<br> I'll be out there with you.<br> Any chance I can get you to<br> go out there instead of me?<br> (chuckles) I love you, Steve.<br> I love you too, Woz.<br> WOZNIAK: You know, some things were said.<br> STEVE: They were. They were said in public.<br> They were published. Were<br> you pressured to do it?<br> WOZNIAK: Was I what?<br> Check it out. It's the orchestra<br> pit for the San Francisco Opera.<br> Was I pressured to do it?<br> I once met Seiji Ozawa at Tanglewood.<br> A thunderous conductor.<br> Ungodly artfulness and nuance.<br> And I asked him what exactly a<br> conductor does that a metronome can't.<br> - Surprisingly, he...<br> - He didn't beat the living shit out of you? (chuckles)<br> That's right. No, he said, "The<br> musicians play their instruments.<br> I play the orchestra."<br> That feels like something that sounds<br> good, but doesn't mean anything.<br> Markkula, Sculley... Did they ask<br> you to slag me off in the press?<br> I had reason to be angry.<br> - Did they?<br> - Absolutely not.<br> But they asked you to talk.<br> Apple was under siege.<br> You'd just left the company.<br> Someone had to talk to the press.<br> I'm right here, Woz. The company left me.<br> I begged you. I begged you.<br> The Apple II accounted<br> for 70% of the revenue.<br> What did you think was gonna happen?<br> You didn't care enough about<br> the Apple II or the Lisa.<br> Let's be really clear.<br> I didn't care at all about<br> the Apple II or the Lisa.<br> I wasn't pressured to do it.<br> What I said to the press was an honest,<br> if tempered, reflection of what I believed.<br> - Woz.<br> - Yeah?<br> What the fuck is on your wrist?<br> - You wanna know?<br> - I literally can't wait.<br> Everyone's gonna be<br> wearing these in 10 years.<br> It's a Nixie watch, made using Nixie tubes.<br> This is actually<br> 40-year-old technology.<br> Cold cathode tubes. They're<br> operating at 140 volts.<br> I tilt my wrist 45<br> degrees, it's right there.<br> Hours, minutes and seconds.<br> The way our minds work. Look at that.<br> Do me a favor. Set the watch<br> ahead like you're on a plane<br> and just changed time zones.<br> Not a problem.<br> Unscrew that. Just hit the button.<br> Excuse me. Flight attendant? The man next<br> to me would appear to be detonating a bomb.<br> You think this looks like a bomb.<br> Even right now, I'm not 100% sure it isn't.<br> - I think maybe once people get used to it...<br> - No.<br> I was angry.<br> You were saying things about the Apple II,<br> and the way you were treating the team...<br> Woz. You get a free pass for life.<br> I got to get back onstage. We got<br> two minutes of rehearsal time left.<br> Do you understand how condescending<br> that just was? Maybe you don't.<br> I don't want to see you get dragged<br> off an airplane in plastic handcuffs.<br> I get a free pass for life from you?<br> You give out the pass...<br> Y-Y-You give them to me?<br> You're gonna have a stroke, little buddy.<br> What did you do? What did you do?<br> Why has Lisa not heard of me?<br> Shit, man, how many<br> fourth-graders have heard of you?<br> You can't write code. You're not<br> an engineer. You're not a designer.<br> You can't put a hammer to a nail.<br> I built the circuit board.<br> The graphical interface<br> was stolen from Xerox PARC.<br> Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team<br> before you threw him off his own project.<br> Everything... Someone<br> else designed the box.<br> So how come 10 times in a day,<br> I read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?<br> What do you do?<br> I play the orchestra.<br> And you're a good musician.<br> You sit right there.<br> You're the best in your row.<br> I came here to clear the air.<br> - Do you know why I came here?<br> - Didn't you just answer that?<br> I came here because<br> you're gonna get killed.<br> Your computer's gonna fail.<br> You had a college and<br> university advisory board<br> telling you they need a powerful<br> workstation for 2,000 to 3,000.<br> You've priced NeXT at 6,500.<br> And that doesn't include the<br> optional $3,000 hard drive,<br> which people will discover isn't optional.<br> Because the optical disk<br> is too weak to do anything.<br> And the $2,500 laser printer<br> brings the total to $12,000.<br> And in the entire world,<br> you are the only person<br> who cares that it's<br> housed in a perfect cube.<br> You're gonna get killed.<br> And I came here to stand<br> next to you while that happens<br> because that's what friends do.<br> That's what men do. I don't need your pass.<br> We go back, so don't talk<br> to me like I'm other people.<br> I'm the only one that knows<br> that this guy here is someone you invented.<br> I'm standing by you because that<br> perfect cube that does nothing<br> is about to be the single biggest failure<br> in the history of personal computing.<br> Tell me something else I don't know.<br> - Back onstage?<br> - We're out of time.<br> They've got to mop the<br> stage and open the house.<br> If it crashes, it crashes, right?<br> You'll make a joke.<br> I'll make a joke.<br> If it crashes, it crashes.<br> It's a good slogan. "NeXT.<br> If it crashes, it crashes."<br> I'm not just talking about the demo, Steve.<br> If it tanks, we don't swallow cyanide.<br> - We go back to the drawing board.<br> - No more drawing boards.<br> Invent the Edsel twice, you<br> don't get any more drawing boards.<br> Tell me what the plan is.<br> You have to tell me the<br> plan, because I don't know.<br> You're walking around like<br> you've got "Can't Lose" cards.<br> The plan will reveal itself to<br> you when you're ready to see it.<br> Will I have to drop acid?<br> Couldn't hurt.<br> Is there a plan?<br> Have I ever let you down?<br> Every single goddamn time.<br> - Then I'm due.<br> - Is there?<br> Joanna, there's a plan.<br> I just don't wanna put you in a<br> position where you're lying to people.<br> (sighs)<br> Start 15 minutes late so Avie can<br> recompile and give us a fighting chance.<br> Jesus Christ. How many times<br> are we gonna have this con...<br> - We're not starting late, ever!<br> - Fine!<br> - We're not ever starting late.<br> - Late.<br> But where do you come<br> down on starting late?<br> (snaps fingers)<br> Lisa's been doing this thing where she<br> asks me about stuff I've already told her.<br> She asks me questions, and I know<br> she already knows the answers.<br> What's that about?<br> Kids do that when they're scared one<br> of their parents is in a bad mood.<br> They try to get you talking<br> about something you like.<br> It's very common and can be treated by<br> talking to her about things she likes.<br> Do you have any experience<br> or training in this field?<br> No.<br> Tell them to open the house.<br> - Where's Lisa?<br> - She's around.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - She's running around the building.<br> An hour ago, you said you<br> were taking her to school.<br> She begged me to let her stay. There<br> are fathers who would so love...<br> It is wrong, okay? It is morally<br> wrong, it's parentally wrong.<br> It is wrong for you to use Lisa<br> as a way of getting money from me.<br> She will know, if she doesn't already,<br> that that is your primary use for her.<br> - (water splashes)<br> - She will hate you for the rest of your life.<br> She will see, if she doesn't already, that<br> her mother is a woman who stands up to men.<br> By living off of them.<br> By not letting myself be<br> imprisoned and degraded by them.<br> (toilet flushes)<br> Imprisoned? I can't get rid of you.<br> I need a doctor and I need a dentist.<br> I dropped out of college after a<br> semester, but, okay, let's have a look.<br> You will support your<br> daughter and her mother.<br> Did you pay someone<br> $1,500 to bless your house?<br> - Did you hear what I said?<br> - Did you?<br> I don't remember how much it was, Steve.<br> - It was $1,500.<br> - Well, they don't do it for free.<br> They don't. They charge $1,500.<br> How I spend... Fuck. You<br> know, I'm not even gonna...<br> Were you about to say, "How I spend<br> my money is none of your business"?<br> I have a sinus infection and<br> I need to see a dentist too.<br> So you can see how your blessing<br> budget could have been better spent.<br> Like on a perfect cube?<br> - Look at me, Chrisann.<br> - What?<br> - You know who I am, right?<br> - Yes.<br> - And you know I know people.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Look at me. And you know the<br> people I know, they know people.<br> What is this?<br> If I ever hear again that you've<br> thrown a cereal bowl at Lisa's head...<br> - What?<br> - my private line's gonna ring,<br> and a voice on the other end<br> is gonna say, "We're all set."<br> - That's how I'll learn that you're dead.<br> - Are you cra...<br> I threw the bowl on the floor.<br> I didn't throw it at her head.<br> She wasn't even in the room.<br> She was nowhere... I threw<br> the bowl on the floor.<br> She's a little girl. You're scaring her.<br> I'm a grown man. You're scaring me.<br> Taking out the garbage is a chore.<br> Clearing the table is a chore.<br> Waking you up in the morning<br> is just fucking creepy.<br> - Please teach me more about being a parent.<br> - We're all done here.<br> It means so much coming from<br> someone who won't admit he is one.<br> - Stop screaming at Lisa.<br> - I give her responsibilities.<br> - Got it.<br> - One day she's gonna thank me for it.<br> - Probably in your sleep.<br> - Fuck off!<br> Okay.<br> I never... I never threw<br> anything at her head.<br> Steve.<br> I never would.<br> Things don't become so because you say so.<br> There'll be more money in your<br> account by the end of business.<br> (weeping)<br> - Were you being nice?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> (weeping continues)<br> - Andy's next.<br> - Hertzfeld or Cunningham?<br> Hertzfeld. He's playing with Avie<br> Tevanian on the computer backstage.<br> WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the house is now open.<br> (chattering)<br> - ...playing in front of thousands of people.<br> - Steve!<br> Can he do it later, Joel?<br> We go in eight minutes.<br> - Can I get a quick reaction to the press this morning?<br> - What about it?<br> - The size of it, the volume.<br> - I'll tell you on background...<br> - I was hoping for a quote from Steve.<br> - I'll tell you on background<br> that I've never seen anything<br> like it in the tech industry.<br> I called the Wall Street Journal<br> to take out a full-page ad for today,<br> and do you know what their sales guy said?<br> "Why bother? It'd be like notifying<br> Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."<br> - You saw the Stewart Alsop newsletter?<br> - I did.<br> I'm sorry, Joanna, I need<br> to get Steve on the record.<br> The headline was "Dear NeXT,<br> when can I get my machine?"<br> - When can he?<br> - We'll announce the ship date in the next eight to 10 weeks.<br> Alsop's not talking about the ship date.<br> He wants to know when he<br> can get one to play with.<br> We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop,<br> and we want to get a machine into his hands<br> so he can tell his subscribers about it.<br> - And when will that be?<br> - Very soon.<br> Couple of days? A week?<br> Off the record.<br> - Off the record?<br> - Completely.<br> - We think...<br> - He'll get it when it's finished.<br> It's not finished?<br> It's almost finished.<br> - I've been watching you rehearse the demo for three weeks.<br> - Yeah.<br> - What's left?<br> - A little thing.<br> - What?<br> - I think that's enough.<br> We're off the record, and Joel's always<br> been good at understanding nuance.<br> What's left to finish?<br> I guess, in layman's terms, you'd<br> have to say we don't have an OS.<br> - An operating system?<br> - Yeah.<br> - JOEL: What do you mean?<br> - Well, the OS is what runs the computer.<br> In fact, it sort of is the computer.<br> How has it been running? How's<br> it gonna run this morning?<br> What do you mean, you don't have an OS?<br> STEVE: It's like this. Avie Tevanian<br> is our chief software designer,<br> and he wrote a demo program.<br> It's like we built a great car,<br> but we haven't built the engine.<br> So we put a golf cart battery<br> in there to make it go for a bit.<br> All this computer knows how to do<br> right now is demonstrate itself.<br> You're telling me the only thing<br> you've built is a black cube?<br> Yes. Yeah.<br> But isn't it the coolest<br> black cube you've ever seen?<br> Is this... We're off the record.<br> Is this a strategy or a<br> problem? If it's a problem...<br> Do not share proprietary<br> knowledge with that man.<br> It's not a problem.<br> I wouldn't understand it anyway.<br> I don't understand it either,<br> and my name's on the patents.<br> - It's got e-mail.<br> - Well, e-mail's not just for tech specialists anymore.<br> Well, it is, but it won't be.<br> And I assume an e-mail sent on a NeXT computer<br> can only be received by a NeXT computer?<br> Closed,<br> end-to-end.<br> The new trash can is wrong.<br> I wanna tell you I appreciate<br> all the hours you put into it,<br> but I can't because of how terrible it is.<br> Go back to the other one.<br> Why are we still giving<br> three options on the clock?<br> - How many options do you want to give?<br> - Two. Buy it or don't.<br> Can I talk to you for a second?<br> Abso-fruitly.<br> Uh, look, man. Avie's been recompiling,<br> but he says there may be<br> some glitches this morning.<br> If all there are are some glitches,<br> it'll be a triumph of miraculous magnitude.<br> Why are you translating for Avie?<br> I-I didn't want him to find out the hard<br> way your position on glitches in a demo,<br> but it sounds like you've mellowed.<br> I've been growing, Andy. I've<br> been learning to love myself.<br> Hmm. I wouldn't have ever<br> dreamed that was a problem.<br> (chuckles) Fantastic burn.<br> You need to go to your seat.<br> How about Lisa, getting into<br> a school for gifted kids?<br> Yeah, she was tested and<br> it turns out she can fly.<br> - Seriously, it's a big deal.<br> - I know it's a big deal.<br> That's why I built the school a building.<br> - Well, I'm sure that's not why she got in.<br> - Really?<br> Uh, can I show you something<br> funny from Macworld?<br> - I can't think of anything I have to do right now.<br> - It'll make you feel good.<br> - Joanna! Look at this!<br> - Oh, Andy, he's only got a couple of minutes.<br> It's Guy Kawasaki writing in<br> Macworld. You're gonna like this.<br> Well, can we all enjoy it later?<br> He wrote a parody press release<br> about Apple buying NeXT for your OS.<br> He imagines a near future where Apple<br> needs your OS and has to buy NeXT,<br> and-and you come back as CEO.<br> He has Gates saying,<br> "There would now be more innovations<br> from Jobs that Microsoft could copy."<br> - You can read it later.<br> - Thanks.<br> She would've gotten in without<br> you donating a building.<br> Still, it's something to<br> talk about in the interview.<br> (exhales) All right. Good luck.<br> Thanks.<br> Give that to me. I'll throw it out for you.<br> I'm gonna hang on to it.<br> What?<br> What?<br> You ready for Sculley?<br> Excuse me!<br> Lisa!<br> You can't shout!<br> (elevator bell dings)<br> Lisa?<br> You have to go.<br> It's dangerous up here. That's<br> why I make other people do it.<br> Who are you hiding from, me or your mom?<br> I'm not hiding.<br> Let's go.<br> What were you listening to?<br> I'm listening to two<br> versions of the same song.<br> Then when I get to the ends, I<br> rewind to listen to them again.<br> It's the same song, but<br> the versions are different.<br> - What's the song?<br> - Okay.<br> So it's a really old song, and<br> it's called "Both Sides, Now."<br> - "Both Sides, Now"?<br> - Yeah.<br> What's it about?<br> It's about... There are three<br> verses: Clouds, love and life.<br> And the person singing is singing<br> that they used to think of...<br> That they used to think about...<br> - Clouds, love and life?<br> - Right.<br> One way, yeah, but now they look<br> at them another way, and they...<br> They've come to the conclusion that they<br> really don't know clouds, love or life at all.<br> Those are the exact words.<br> Yeah, Joni Mitchell.<br> 'Cause it's not a really old<br> song, unless I'm a really old guy.<br> You have to go to school now.<br> Do you want me to tell you the<br> differences between the two versions?<br> Right now.<br> The first version is the kind of<br> thing that you would call girlish.<br> I didn't mean I want to know<br> the difference right now.<br> I meant you have to go to school right now.<br> I can stay and watch.<br> You are truant. You're committing a crime.<br> I'm not gonna miss anything important.<br> - How do you know?<br> - I read ahead.<br> The Pilgrims make it to the New World.<br> Then the Declaration of Independence.<br> Yeah, you skipped a couple centuries.<br> Steve? Chrisann's out there.<br> (audience clapping and<br> stomping rhythmically)<br> STEVE: Let's go.<br> Can I make my case for staying?<br> Nope.<br> (clapping, stomping grow faster)<br> - She was with me.<br> - Come on. Your dad doesn't want us to stay.<br> That's not true. That's not...<br> You have to be in school is all.<br> I'm committing a crime right now,<br> and I don't wanna get in trouble.<br> You're not in trouble. I was kidding.<br> Okay.<br> Hey. What was the second version?<br> You said the first version was<br> girlish. What was the second version?<br> I can't really think of the word.<br> Okay. Well, have a good day at school.<br> - Regretful.<br> - What?<br> Like wishing you could go<br> back and do things different.<br> You're too young to be regretful.<br> Not me.<br> The person singing the song.<br> Got it. Regretful. That<br> makes sense because...<br> (whispers) I wanna live with you.<br> Six minutes.<br> - You want to see Sculley?<br> - No.<br> You know all those times I<br> told you you needed security?<br> Here's why.<br> I don't know how it is I've<br> gotten older and you haven't.<br> Some deal with the devil<br> I was never offered.<br> So you know what I've been<br> thinking for the last four years?<br> (scoffs) As it turns out, John, I've<br> never known what you were thinking.<br> No newborn baby has control.<br> Do you know what I'm talking about?<br> In '84, before the Mac launch. You said...<br> - Yeah.<br> - You said that being adopted meant you didn't have control.<br> We're starting in a minute, so...<br> Why do people think I fired you?<br> It's fine, John. It's all behind us.<br> Is it? Hmm?<br> Don't play stupid. You can't pull it off.<br> You came here to ask me why<br> people think you fired me?<br> Why do people think I fired you?<br> Just confirm something for me, okay?<br> - You liked the ad, right?<br> - (chuckles)<br> The commercial... "1984." You liked it.<br> - JOHN: When are you gonna get furniture?<br> - It's not an easy process.<br> JOHN: It is. You buy a<br> couch, take it from there.<br> I'd be really surprised if you came<br> here to talk about interior decorating.<br> I liked the ad very much.<br> - You did?<br> - You know I did.<br> You're a lying son of a<br> bitch. You tried to kill it.<br> - It's time to take a hard look at the Mac.<br> - It's past time.<br> It's overpriced. We<br> need to drop it to 1,995.<br> We need to double the marketing budget,<br> put more bodies on an internal hard drive<br> and invest in FileServer.<br> - Where the hell did you get the idea I tried to kill...<br> - Lee Clow.<br> - Lee's wrong.<br> - He's lying?<br> - He's... mistaken.<br> - JOHN: Where would the money come from?<br> It would come from finally<br> getting rid of the Apple II.<br> The Apple II is the<br> only thing making money.<br> - You agreed with the board.<br> - I understood the board's concerns, but I...<br> The board's concerns that<br> we didn't show the product?<br> - Among other things, but my question was...<br> - What other things?<br> I'm asking because I'm curious.<br> You said "among other things."<br> Among other things, it was<br> set in a dystopian galaxy.<br> It took place on a planet<br> where we don't live.<br> It was dark and the opposite of our brand.<br> And we didn't show the product.<br> People talked about the ad but most of<br> them didn't know what we were selling.<br> The Mac needs to sell for 1,995.<br> There is no market research telling us<br> the Mac is failing because it's overpriced.<br> It's telling us that people don't like it<br> because they think it doesn't do anything.<br> It's closed,<br> end-to-end.<br> We didn't know it wasn't what<br> people wanted, but it isn't.<br> They want slots, they want<br> choices, they want options.<br> The way we buy stereos...<br> mix and match components.<br> John, listen to me. Whoever<br> said the customer is always right<br> was, I promise you, a customer.<br> - It had skinheads in it.<br> - She was liberating them.<br> - Liberating the skinheads.<br> - The ad didn't have anything to do with fucking skinheads.<br> We used them as fucking extras.<br> Nobody even knows they were skinheads.<br> I'm just saying the board had concerns...<br> You invented lifestyle advertising.<br> And our brand was my brand.<br> My job is to make a<br> recommendation to the board.<br> We showed a lot of happy<br> people drinking Pepsi.<br> We didn't say the world was going<br> to end if you bought a Dr. Pepper.<br> Recommend that we drop the price<br> and double the marketing budget.<br> - I can't.<br> - And we showed the product.<br> We showed it being opened, we showed<br> it being poured, being consumed.<br> What are you gonna do,<br> recommend that we kill the Mac?<br> I already have, Steve.<br> What? When?<br> You think the secret to your success<br> was not assuming people knew<br> what to do with a can of soda?<br> I didn't kill the ad, Steve! I'm the<br> only reason it made it on the air.<br> Just now. An hour ago.<br> I'm coming from Markkula's house.<br> - What did he say?<br> - (chuckles)<br> - What did he say?<br> - Invent something new.<br> I'll give you a team. You can sit in Maui.<br> The resorts come with couches.<br> Wait a minute. Are you saying you<br> recommended terminating the Mac<br> or you recommended taking<br> me off the Mac team?<br> We bought three spots in the<br> Super Bowl. Two 30's and a 60.<br> After we screened it, the<br> board wanted that money back<br> and they asked me to sell off the spots.<br> Chiat/Day sold off the<br> two 30's but not the 60,<br> and I let it be known to Lee Clow<br> that if he didn't try very<br> hard to sell the last spot,<br> I wouldn't be unhappy.<br> If we drop the price<br> and double the budget...<br> Drop the price or double<br> the budget. (stammers)<br> The only way to do that is to<br> take money out of the Apple II.<br> The Apple II should embarrass<br> you. It embarrasses me.<br> It doesn't embarrass the shareholders.<br> I don't give a shit about the shareholders.<br> That's why I hired you, so I don't<br> have to hear about shareholders.<br> The shareholders are my problem, and<br> the board represents the shareholders.<br> That's how it works.<br> You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who<br> dragged his feet selling the 60?<br> At my direction, Steve.<br> You think he would have done that<br> on his own, taken it on himself?<br> Yeah. I think he would've done<br> what it took to save it from you.<br> - I was the only thing protecting it.<br> - You didn't want the ad<br> because you were trying to kill the<br> Mac two months before it launched.<br> You are fucking delusional.<br> (sighs)<br> - Can I mention something to you?<br> - Sure.<br> I have no earthly idea why you're here.<br> The story of why and how you left Apple,<br> which is quickly becoming<br> mythologized, isn't true.<br> - I'm gonna take this to the board myself.<br> - Don't do that.<br> - I am doing that.<br> - You can't.<br> Why?<br> They believe you're no longer<br> necessary to this company.<br> I get hate mail, death threats.<br> I get death threats.<br> My kids are getting taunted.<br> Why do people think I fired you?<br> Joanna's gonna call my name in a second.<br> - JOANNA: Steve?<br> - That was unrehearsed.<br> Yeah, I'll be there in just a second.<br> I gave you your day in court.<br> - You gave me?<br> - I gave the board a clear choice.<br> I said, "Do you want to invest in the Apple<br> II or the Mac?" They chose the Apple II.<br> The same people who wanted<br> to dump the Super Bowl spot.<br> And then I got on a plane to China.<br> Mr. Sculley. There's a<br> call for you on Line One.<br> Or I almost got on a plane,<br> because I got a call in the lounge.<br> - Who made that call?<br> - Doesn't matter.<br> STEVE: It matters to<br> me. Who made the call?<br> John Sculley.<br> MAN (on phone): John? If<br> you get on that plane,<br> you'll have lost your<br> job by the time it lands.<br> Steve's been calling the<br> board. He wants you out.<br> JOHN: I left my bags on the plane.<br> My shit's still somewhere in Beijing.<br> I took a car back to Cupertino in<br> the middle of the fucking night.<br> I know what time it is. I need a quorum<br> here in one hour and I want Steve here too.<br> STEVE: You took me off the<br> Mac, and it was bad business.<br> - The quorum call was a homicide.<br> - Right there! Right there.<br> That's the part that's bullshit, my friend.<br> It was a suicide.<br> Because you knew your<br> cards and I showed you mine.<br> I showed you mine, and you did it anyway.<br> What did you think I was gonna do?<br> I'm okay losing, but I'm not gonna forfeit.<br> I'm not okay losing.<br> JOHN: We're losing market share,<br> and the Mac is losing money.<br> Our only hope is the Apple II, which is<br> stagnating because of its soon-to-be-obsolete DOS.<br> Users are already rigging their machines<br> to run with a CP/M operating system<br> that's been built to run on Intel.<br> I can't put it more simply than this.<br> We need to put our resources<br> into updating the Apple II.<br> STEVE: By taking<br> resources from the Mac.<br> JOHN: It's failing. That's a fact.<br> - It's overpriced.<br> - There's no evidence that it's...<br> I'm the evidence!<br> I'm the world's leading expert on<br> the Mac, John. What's your rsum?<br> You're issuing contradictory instructions,<br> you're insubordinate,<br> you make people miserable.<br> Our top engineers are<br> fleeing to Sun, Dell, HP.<br> Wall Street doesn't know<br> who's driving the bus.<br> We've lost hundreds of millions in value.<br> And I'm the CEO of Apple,<br> Steve. That's my rsum.<br> But before that, you sold<br> carbonated sugar water, right?<br> I sat in a fucking garage with<br> Wozniak and invented the future.<br> Because artists lead and<br> hacks ask for a show of hands.<br> All right.<br> Well, this guy's out of control.<br> I'm perfectly willing to hand<br> in my resignation tonight,<br> but if you want me to<br> stay, you can't have Steve.<br> Settle him out.<br> He can keep a share of stock<br> so he gets our newsletter.<br> He'll have to sever his<br> connection to Apple.<br> I'm dead serious. I want the<br> secretary to call for a vote.<br> I fucking dare you.<br> You have done an outstanding job over<br> the years of cultivating the press.<br> And by that, I mean manipulating them.<br> Because none of them, none of their<br> editors, none of their editors' publishers<br> to this day know that you forced it,<br> that you forced the board.<br> Even after I told you<br> exactly what they'd do,<br> which is exactly what they did.<br> Unanimously.<br> I don't have any trouble<br> remembering that, John,<br> because of it being the<br> worst night of my life.<br> And I forced the vote because<br> I believed I was right.<br> - I still believe I'm right. And I'm right.<br> - (mutters)<br> Now I bled that night.<br> And I don't bleed.<br> But time's done its thing,<br> and I really haven't<br> thought about it in a while.<br> Now, I absolutely<br> understand why you're upset.<br> And I want people to<br> know the truth too.<br> JOANNA: It's time.<br> Got it.<br> You're gonna end me, aren't you?<br> STEVE: You're being ridiculous.<br> I'm gonna sit center court<br> and watch you do it yourself.<br> Then I'm gonna order a nice meal with<br> a '55 Margaux and sign some autographs.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> - You want some advice, Pepsi Generation?<br> Don't send Woz out to slap<br> me around in the press.<br> Anybody else... you, Markkula, Arthur Rock.<br> Anyone but Rain Man.<br> Don't manipulate him like that.<br> Whatever you may think, I'm<br> always gonna protect him.<br> Come on, Steve.<br> That's what men do.<br> - We can't start late.<br> - (mutters)<br> I don't think there was any way<br> to detect a chip on my shoulder.<br> Did you know, back at Bandley,<br> the Mac team gave an award every year<br> to the person who could stand up to you?<br> No.<br> - I won. Three years in a row.<br> - Cool.<br> This.<br> This... This Guy Kawasaki<br> in Macworld.<br> He accidentally got it right, didn't he?<br> You've been dragging<br> your feet on the NeXT OS<br> till you can figure out<br> what Apple's gonna need.<br> (clicks tongue)<br> Even if that were true, it doesn't<br> sound that diabolical to me.<br> WOMAN: Hey.

Take this.<br> Everybody, that's it. They've got to<br> mop the stage, reset and open the house.<br> I love you guys.<br> (applause, cheering)<br> Andy, come on back a minute.<br> - Which one?<br> - Hertzfeld.<br> Forbes calls it an<br> "industry-altering success."<br> Look here.<br> Why haven't we ever slept together?<br> We're not in love. Look.<br> - Sculley.<br> - Look what he said.<br> "He has implemented the same simple strategy<br> that made Apple so successful 15 years ago...<br> make hit products and promote<br> them with terrific marketing."<br> - It was nice of him.<br> - It was.<br> I meant it.<br> Sightings of J.D. Salinger are<br> more common than John Sculley.<br> I wasn't being sarcastic.<br> It was nice of him.<br> - Do you talk to him?<br> - No.<br> You haven't talked to him since '88?<br> I'd have told you if I did.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> I don't want people<br> thinking they can cross me<br> - (snaps fingers)<br> - and then, boom, 15 years later, I'm cool with it.<br> I was kidding.<br> What's wrong with you this morning?<br> Let's get off the stage.<br> "The only thing Apple's providing<br> now is leadership in colors."<br> Don't worry about it.<br> - What does Bill Gates have against me?<br> - I don't know.<br> You're both out of your<br> minds. Listen to me.<br> He dropped out of a better<br> school than I dropped out of.<br> But he's a tool bag. I'll tell you why.<br> Make everything all right with Lisa.<br> You know, Joanna? Boundaries.<br> You've come to my apartment<br> at 1:00 AM and cleaned it.<br> So tell me where the boundary is.<br> - There. Let's say it's there.<br> - (sighs)<br> If I give you some real projections,<br> will you promise not to<br> repeat them from the stage?<br> What do you mean, "real projections"?<br> - What have you been giving me?<br> - Conservative projections.<br> Marketing's been lying to me?<br> We've been managing expectations<br> so that you don't not.<br> What are the real projections?<br> We're gonna sell a million<br> units in the first 90 days.<br> - (strikes table)<br> - 20,000 a month after that.<br> - Holy shit.<br> - Yeah.<br> You see? You wait long enough and...<br> What's more, 32% of the sales<br> are going to go to people buying<br> a computer for the first time.<br> And 12% are going to people using<br> some kind of Windows machine.<br> That's what Bill Gates has against you.<br> And it'll be the fastest-selling<br> computer in history.<br> You brought the company<br> back from life support<br> after going through the misery<br> of laying off 3,000 people<br> and cutting 70% of the product line.<br> So, Steven, it's over.<br> You're gonna win.<br> - It would be criminal not to enjoy this moment.<br> - I'm enjoying it.<br> Make things all right with Lisa.<br> - You know...<br> - Come on.<br> I don't like having less<br> privacy than other people have.<br> - Does being a multi-billionaire take some of the sting off that?<br> - No.<br> - All Lisa did...<br> - All Lisa did was give her blessing.<br> - Chrisann sold the house and...<br> - And Lisa could have done what?<br> How was she supposed to stop her<br> mother from selling her own house?<br> That I bought for the two of them.<br> How was she supposed to stop her?<br> Voicing an objection would have<br> been a step in the right direction.<br> You don't think you're<br> having a bizarre overreaction<br> to a 19-year-old girl allowing<br> her mother to list her own house?<br> She could've tried.<br> Was she supposed to stop her<br> mother, that particular mother...<br> She gave Chrisann her blessing to sell<br> the house and she did it to spite me.<br> I don't care if she put a<br> pipe bomb in the water heater.<br> You're going to fix it, now.<br> She's been acting weird for<br> months. She's turned on me.<br> - Fix it.<br> - What the...<br> Fix it, Steve.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Fix it or I quit.<br> How about that? I quit,<br> and you never see me again.<br> How about that?<br> Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.<br> What's been wrong with me for 19 years.<br> (weeping)<br> I've been a witness, and I<br> tell you, I've been complicit.<br> I love you, Steve. You know how much.<br> I love that you don't care how much money a<br> person makes. You care what they make.<br> But what you make isn't supposed<br> to be the best part of you.<br> When you're a father,<br> that's what's supposed to<br> be the best part of you.<br> And it's caused me two decades of<br> agony, Steve, that it is for you<br> the worst.<br> (sighs) It's a little thing.<br> It's a very small thing.<br> (sniffles) Fix it.<br> Fix it now, or you can<br> contact me at my new job...<br> working anywhere I want.<br> I don't happen to think it is<br> a little deal. She knew that...<br> - No.<br> - I bought the house for the two of...<br> - No.<br> - What do you mean, "no"?<br> I mean no. The house has nothing<br> to do with why you're angry at Lisa.<br> I assure you, the house has everything<br> to do with why I'm angry at Lisa.<br> Have you ever heard the phrase<br> "reality distortion field"?<br> - Yes.<br> - As in "Steve's reality distortion field"?<br> I've heard it. I've read it.<br> It's been sung to me by Joan Baez.<br> What you call a reality distortion field,<br> and I'm pretty sure you're<br> the one who coined the phrase,<br> - is the reason we're here.<br> - I know that.<br> If I traded in my bank account for a dollar<br> every time somebody told me something<br> was impossible, I'd come out ahead.<br> - I know that too.<br> - What's the problem?<br> - My problem? It sure isn't the house.<br> - Jo, I...<br> It's that you told her you<br> weren't going to pay for Harvard.<br> That child.<br> That earnest, unironic kid.<br> She told you I wasn't paying her tuition?<br> I should have hit you with<br> something heavy a long time ago.<br> Lisa told you I wasn't paying her tuition?<br> - Andy told me that.<br> - Which one?<br> Hertzfeld.<br> How would Hertzfeld know?<br> He wrote Harvard a check for<br> 25,000 to cover the semester.<br> Are you fucking... He paid her tuition?<br> Isn't that why you just asked to see him?<br> No, I asked to see him about something...<br> Did you tell her you weren't<br> going to pay for college?<br> - Yes, because...<br> - How could you do that?<br> Because her mother, who<br> is also her landlord...<br> Hertzfeld? I was ranting.<br> I was just, you know... I was<br> talking. You think I would...<br> I was pissed off because Lisa<br> was trying to piss me off, Joanna.<br> That was her intent. I don't know...<br> You obviously scared the hell out of her.<br> Hertzfeld wrote a check<br> to Harvard, pay for...<br> - Is she here yet?<br> - I'm sure she is.<br> Can you have someone bring her back?<br> Yes.<br> (exhales)<br> Thank you.<br> You know,<br> my grandmother always used to say to me...<br> I don't give a shit, Yentl.<br> - I'll have someone get Lisa.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And if you see Hertzfeld...<br> - (knocking)<br> HERTZFELD: It's Andy.<br> Speak of the devil's chief engineer.<br> Go.<br> Come on in.<br> You look great today.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Doesn't she?<br> She looks fantastic. Always does. Get out.<br> - Well, I think I know why I'm here.<br> - Do you?<br> Steve...<br> - Did you send the check yet?<br> - Yes.<br> So Harvard got a tuition check<br> from Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?<br> I don't think they look that carefully.<br> I don't think they'd notice<br> the check didn't come from you.<br> Close one. This was<br> almost embarrassing for me.<br> (sighs) I understand how...<br> I'll wire you the money today.<br> I-I understand how you feel.<br> And I do apologize. I do.<br> But let me tell you my thinking.<br> I can't even think of an appropriate<br> analogy to describe what you did.<br> I knew you guys would<br> fix things. You always do.<br> But in the meantime, if the money wasn't<br> there, she'd miss a semester of school.<br> - Yeah.<br> - And she'd have to tell her friends why.<br> And she needed things. She needed socks.<br> - What?<br> - It's cold in Cambridge. She needed warm socks.<br> - You gave her socks?<br> - Well, I gave her money for socks.<br> You don't get to deputize<br> yourself as her interim.<br> You don't get to override my<br> decisions. Do you understand?<br> You don't get to act<br> like you're her father.<br> Somebody had to.<br> What the fuck did you just say to me?<br> I've known her since she was six.<br> I also consider...<br> Chrisann's my friend, outside of what<br> you and I... outside of our relationship.<br> - So you're like a family adviser.<br> - I'm a family friend.<br> Then you probably know that<br> Lisa's been seeing a therapist.<br> - Yeah.<br> - For many years.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Without my knowledge.<br> That really wasn't my business.<br> (chuckles) I'm fascinated by what<br> you think is and isn't your business.<br> Lisa's been going to a<br> therapist and she likes it<br> and would love for you and<br> Chrisann to go with her.<br> And the reason you know that is because<br> you're the one that recommended the therapist.<br> Well, I know a guy.<br> No, I mean you're the one who<br> recommended that she see a therapist.<br> You know what? It was a while ago,<br> and I don't remember how the whole...<br> You told Chrisann that<br> Lisa should see a therapist.<br> Steve, you're stigmatizing.<br> It's a perfectly norm...<br> (sighs) It's not...<br> My thing was, how can it hurt?<br> Let's find out.<br> Chrisann is my friend.<br> - What was the reason you gave?<br> - You mean...<br> What was the reason you gave Chrisann<br> why Lisa should see a therapist?<br> I don't remember. We<br> were talking and I said...<br> It's pretty much what I just said,<br> that it certainly couldn't hurt.<br> You didn't say that Lisa<br> needed a strong male role model?<br> I did.<br> I think it's a miracle she's not robbing<br> banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army.<br> There's no reason in the<br> world why she should be nice.<br> But she is.<br> So I helped, because somebody had to.<br> I'll wire the money to you this afternoon.<br> You threatened me a long time ago.<br> Sorry?<br> A long time ago... You threatened me once.<br> People are attracted to people with talent.<br> People without it find that threatening.<br> - (snaps fingers)<br> - Maybe you should see a therapist.<br> Certainly couldn't hurt.<br> I meant you literally threatened me.<br> At Flint, right before the Mac launch.<br> I was recompiling. I was<br> trying to debug the voice demo.<br> You said if I couldn't find a solution,<br> you'd call me out in front of the audience.<br> - Did it say "hello"?<br> - It did.<br> No need to thank me.<br> Why do you want people to dislike you?<br> I don't want people to dislike me.<br> I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.<br> Since it doesn't matter, I always have.<br> Really?<br> I've always liked you<br> a lot. That's too bad.<br> - Knock 'em dead.<br> - Thank you.<br> What is remarkable, what's<br> hard to fathom but true,<br> is that for a given clock rate, a PowerPC<br> chip is twice as fast as a Pentium II chip.<br> (glasses clatter)<br> In other words,<br> a 266 megahertz G3 chip<br> is twice as fast as a<br> 266 megahertz Pentium II.<br> Or... a 266 G3<br> is equal to about 500 megahertz.<br> STEVE'S VOICE: Do you know<br> what a coincidence is, Lisa?<br> Take a look at Byte<br> magazine's Byte Marks,<br> - the gold standard for any...<br> - (knocking)<br> - Come in.<br> - (door opens)<br> I sent someone into the lobby.<br> - They found her, and she...<br> - Where is she?<br> She said she'd rather not come back.<br> - Why?<br> - That was it.<br> - I'm going out there myself.<br> - You can't. You can't.<br> It'll be a scene out of<br> Hard Day's Night.<br> - (knocking)<br> - (door opens)<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Hey, Joel.<br> Andy said it was okay to come back.<br> - Which one?<br> - Andy Cunningham.<br> I can't do this forever. I need<br> one of them to change their name.<br> You call Andy Cunningham "Andrea."<br> It doesn't matter what I call them.<br> I know who I'm talking<br> about when I'm talking.<br> I need everyone else to<br> call them different names.<br> Give me one second.<br> Can you go get her for me, please?<br> I just talked to Andy.<br> Hertzfeld.<br> I'm just trying to scrub this<br> out of my brain with Drano.<br> But I do want to talk to Lisa.<br> Okay. Just...<br> - Stay cool.<br> - Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, Steve.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - I'm feeling good, Joel. How about you?<br> I don't think I could be in your<br> business. It changes too quickly.<br> Well, I'd hang on, 'cause yours is about<br> to start changing pretty quickly too.<br> This is the third time in 14<br> years I'm writing about you.<br> - What do you think so far?<br> - (knocking)<br> Excuse me. Avie's looking<br> for you. He has a new shark.<br> - You wanna come backstage for a second?<br> - JOEL: Sure.<br> - Who's this one?<br> - Alan Turing.<br> Single-handedly won World War II and,<br> for an encore, invented the computer.<br> - He won't be part of the campaign though.<br> - Why not?<br> 'Cause you just had to ask me who he was.<br> Can I see new shark?<br> I like it better than the old shark.<br> - Sharks.<br> - Sharks.<br> - How many sharks did you go through?<br> - A couple.<br> - This is the 39th.<br> - We're on the record.<br> - Thirty-nine sharks.<br> - Okay.<br> - You know what's special about this shark?<br> - What?<br> No, I'm really asking, because it looks<br> exactly like the other 38 sharks to me.<br> STEVE: Let me see it with<br> the cue, from the profile.<br> WOMAN: This is cue 92-B.<br> This is a profile here, and this<br> is what it looks like from the back.<br> And one more thing. It eats<br> Pentium notebooks as a light snack.<br> This is the shark.<br> I really like it.<br> Nobody gets it right the first time,<br> but I should have been shown<br> this shark 15, 20 fish ago.<br> - You probably were.<br> - Lock it in.<br> Ten minutes.<br> He killed himself by taking a bite<br> of a poison apple... Alan Turing.<br> Yeah.<br> There should be statues of that man.<br> His name should be on the<br> lips of schoolchildren.<br> The rainbow flag apple with a bite<br> taken out... That's where it came from?<br> No, we picked it off a list<br> of friendly-sounding words.<br> But wouldn't it be great if that<br> had been the story behind it?<br> Steve. Kinda liked the last shark.<br> - AVIE: Fuck you.<br> - (chuckles)<br> I wanted to ask you a favor.<br> My friend, a long time ago,<br> you asked me a favor before a<br> product launch, and I said no.<br> - You wanted me to acknowledge...<br> - Hang on.<br> If you're about to say you were wrong,<br> I want to prepare this journalist.<br> I was 100% right, and you<br> were spectacularly wrong.<br> But I still owe you a favor, so name it.<br> (sighs) Steve...<br> - It can't be acknowledging the Apple II team.<br> - Acknowledge the Apple II team.<br> - How about in private?<br> - No.<br> - Is this a prank?<br> - No.<br> I'm trying to remember that<br> a 300 megahertz G3 chip...<br> Just the top guys.<br> Steve.<br> - Excuse me, okay?<br> - Yep.<br> One second.<br> (clears throat)<br> - She said she'd rather not.<br> - What do you mean?<br> She's sitting with her friends, and<br> she said she'd rather not come back.<br> Okay. Tell her... Take her aside.<br> I don't want to embarrass<br> her in front of her friends.<br> But tell her I just scared<br> the shit out of Andy,<br> and this time, nobody's<br> paying her fucking...<br> All right. Don't say that.<br> But do your thing where<br> you sound old and wise<br> because of the broad, tragic<br> European canvas of your life.<br> You know I wasn't born in a<br> 19th-century shtetl, right?<br> Please tell her it's important.<br> - Everything all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - There are people around here, man...<br> - I know.<br> - Including a member of the press.<br> - I see him.<br> Woz.<br> Just the top guys, the ones<br> who are getting laid off.<br> (clears throat) Listen, okay?<br> Last year, Apple lost one billion dollars.<br> I don't even know how that's possible.<br> You were less than 90<br> days from being insolvent.<br> I had three different accountants<br> try to explain it to me.<br> The whole place has to be streamlined.<br> - Start with two of the accountants.<br> - I started with the...<br> - Joel, could you come offstage? We're gonna go backstage.<br> - Leave him right there.<br> I started with the Apple II team<br> because we don't make that anymore.<br> - Just acknowledge the top guys.<br> - Have a mimosa and relax.<br> You will not blow me off right now, Steve.<br> - The top guys deserve...<br> - There are no top guys.<br> All right? On the Apple II<br> team, there are no top guys.<br> They're "B" players, and "B"<br> players discourage the "A" players.<br> I want "A" players at Apple and not Dell.<br> They're not "B" players, and<br> I'm a better judge of that.<br> Less than 90 days from insolvency,<br> in part because somebody thought<br> the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.<br> - Joel, could you come offstage, please?<br> - Leave him.<br> I'm talking about...<br> You guys designed and shipped a<br> little box of garbage while I was gone.<br> I'm talking about the Apple II,<br> which is not just a crucial<br> part of this company's history,<br> it is a crucial part of the<br> history of personal computing.<br> For a time.<br> The least you can do, if you're<br> going to downsize these people...<br> They're gonna live in the biggest houses<br> of anyone on the unemployment line.<br> Is to acknowledge them. Acknowledge<br> them and the Apple II during this launch.<br> This is a new animal.<br> This whole place was built by the Apple<br> II. You were built by the Apple II.<br> As a matter of fact, I was destroyed<br> by the Apple II and its open system<br> so that hackers and hobbyists<br> could build ham radios or something.<br> And then it nearly destroyed Apple<br> when you spent all your money on it<br> and developed a grand<br> total of no new products.<br> - The Newton.<br> - The little box of garbage.<br> You guys came up with the Newton.<br> You want people to know that?<br> This is a product launch, not a luncheon.<br> The last thing I want to<br> do is connect the iMac to...<br> WOZNIAK: To the only successful<br> product that this company has ever made.<br> I'm sorry to be blunt, but<br> that happens to be the truth.<br> The Lisa was a failure.<br> The Macintosh was a failure.<br> I don't like talking like this,<br> but I am tired of being<br> Ringo when I know I was John.<br> Everybody loves Ringo.<br> And I'm tired of being patronized by you.<br> You think John became John<br> by winning a raffle, Woz?<br> You think he tricked somebody<br> or hit George Harrison over the head?<br> He was John because he was John.<br> He was John 'cause he wrote "Ticket<br> to Ride." And I wrote the Apple II.<br> - Everybody? I want to clear the auditorium.<br> - Nobody moves.<br> You made a beautiful board,<br> which, by the way, you were<br> willing to give out for free,<br> so don't tell me how you built Apple.<br> If it weren't for me, you'd be the<br> easiest "A" at Homestead High School.<br> These people live and die by your<br> praise, so here's your chance.<br> Acknowledge that something good happened<br> that you weren't in the room for.<br> - No.<br> - Steve.<br> Do it. It's right. It's...<br> It's right.<br> Sorry, but no.<br> Then let me put it another way.<br> I don't think there's a man<br> who's done more to advance<br> the democratization that comes<br> with personal computing than I have,<br> but you've never had any respect for me.<br> Now why is that?<br> I'd at least consider the possibility<br> that it's because you've<br> never had any for me.<br> (door opens)<br> What the hell is going on here?<br> Nothing. Thank you for your time.<br> It's done. She's coming back.<br> You came a half-inch from putting<br> this company out of business.<br> Now who do I see about that?<br> I'm letting you keep your job.<br> You get a pass.<br> You know, when people used to ask me<br> what the difference was<br> between me and Steve Jobs,<br> I would say Steve was the big-picture guy<br> and I liked a solid workbench.<br> When people ask me what<br> the difference is now,<br> I say "Steve's an asshole."<br> Your products are better<br> than you are, brother.<br> That's the idea, brother.<br> And knowing that, that's the difference.<br> It's not binary.<br> You can be decent and<br> gifted at the same time.<br> JOANNA: He didn't mean it.<br> Yeah, he did.<br> He's a temperamental guy.<br> No, he's not.<br> (scoffs) It's like five<br> minutes before every launch,<br> everyone goes to a bar, gets drunk<br> and tells me what they really think.<br> - (sighs)<br> - She's coming to your dressing room.<br> JOANNA: I told you to make<br> things all right with Lisa.<br> I didn't say you had to settle<br> every blood feud you have.<br> STEVE: Last time blood feuds weren't<br> settled, I lost the cover of Time.<br> Though for the life of me, I still don't know<br> what the hell Dan Kottke was mad at me about.<br> - Kottke didn't lose you the cover of Time.<br> - Of course he did.<br> Would you like me to demonstrate<br> your capacity to be wrong<br> when you're certain you're right?<br> Dan Kottke told Time<br> magazine that I was denying...<br> Do you remember the cover?<br> - Of Time?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - What was it?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - What was on the cover?<br> - A computer.<br> - No.<br> It was a sculpture of a computer.<br> It was a sculpture.<br> Time would have had to have<br> commissioned it months in advance.<br> You were never in the<br> conversation for Man of the Year.<br> Nobody lost you anything.<br> STEVE'S VOICE: ...picture<br> of me and the Mac.<br> So what else are you sure about?<br> I don't know how I could've missed that.<br> - Reality distortion.<br> - No, seriously.<br> Seriously.<br> Don't try to win an argument with Lisa.<br> - Just say you were wrong.<br> - (knocking)<br> Come on in, honey.<br> - It's not "honey."<br> - John.<br> Get in. Get in. Get out of the hall.<br> I was taken in a side entrance.<br> I'll go out the same<br> way. No one will see me.<br> - How are you, Joanna?<br> - I'm good, John.<br> I'm just surprised to see you.<br> Everyone here really appreciates<br> the quote you gave to Forbes.<br> - You didn't have to do that.<br> - My pleasure.<br> JOANNA: If you want, I can slip you in<br> the back once the house lights go out.<br> - JOHN: I'm just here to say "good luck."<br> - Okay.<br> You just have a couple of minutes.<br> - Would you try to find...<br> - Yeah.<br> You're a good man, John.<br> (door opens)<br> (door closes)<br> So I brought you a present.<br> STEVE: A Newton.<br> Don't take it out of the box, you'll be able<br> to sell it, which is more than I can say.<br> Everything all right there?<br> Uh, no... (clears throat)<br> Just something Joanna pointed out to me.<br> I missed something so obvious about...<br> Doesn't matter.<br> Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back<br> and wait to see how you do as CEO,<br> so don't let any fluctuation<br> bother you for the first 12 months.<br> Day traders are gonna respond.<br> I don't need to school you.<br> This your way of telling me I<br> shouldn't have killed the Newton?<br> The most efficient animal<br> on the planet is the condor.<br> The most inefficient animals<br> on the planet are humans.<br> (chuckles) Well, you shouldn't<br> have killed it for spite.<br> That's bad business. Don't do that.<br> But a human with a bicycle<br> becomes the most efficient animal.<br> And the right computer...<br> a friendly, easy computer<br> that isn't an eyesore<br> but rather sits on your desk with<br> the beauty of a Tensor lamp...<br> The right computer will<br> be a bicycle for the mind.<br> Do you like it?<br> I was giving back.<br> And what if instead of it<br> being in the right hands,<br> it was in everyone's hands?<br> Everyone in the world.<br> JOHN: We'd be talking about the most<br> tectonic shift in the status quo since...<br> Ever.<br> I don't know why you've always been<br> interested in my adoption history,<br> but you said it's not like someone<br> looked at me and gave me back.<br> But that is what happened.<br> And you're telling me you<br> have the right computer.<br> It's called Macintosh.<br> A lawyer couple adopted me first,<br> then gave me back after a month.<br> They changed their mind.<br> Then my parents adopted me.<br> My biological mother had<br> stipulated that whoever took me<br> had to be college-educated,<br> wealthy and Catholic.<br> Paul and Clara Jobs were<br> none of those things,<br> so my biological mother wouldn't<br> sign the adoption papers.<br> What happened?<br> There was a legal battle<br> that went on for a while.<br> My mother said she refused<br> to love me for the first year.<br> You know, in case they had to give me back.<br> You can't refuse to love someone, Steve.<br> Yeah, it turns out you can.<br> What the hell can a one-month-old do<br> that's so bad his parents give him back?<br> Nothing. There's nothing<br> a one-month-old can do...<br> Have you ever thought about trying<br> to find your biological father?<br> I've met my biological father.<br> For that matter, so have you.<br> It's called Macintosh.<br> - Mr. Steve Jobs.<br> - Jandali.<br> Say hello to John Sculley.<br> Jandali owns the place,<br> and John's the CEO of Pepsi,<br> but I'm trying to get him to move to<br> Cupertino, put a dent in the universe.<br> You eat vegan as well?<br> You're kidding me.<br> No, I'll eat anything.<br> Why don't you start off with the Mediterranean<br> lettuce salad with purslane, mint...<br> My sister found him.<br> - Does he know?<br> - No. In fact, he bragged to Mona<br> that Steve Jobs comes in<br> the restaurant all the time.<br> - You don't want to...<br> - No.<br> JOHN: Don't you think<br> you should talk to him?<br> He'd probably find a reason to sue me.<br> Oh, Steve...<br> John, if you're here about your legacy,<br> you need to form a line behind Wozniak.<br> (sighs) Wozniak's gonna be fine.<br> I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.<br> Rich, college-educated and Catholic.<br> - (knocks)<br> - Steve? It's time.<br> (smacks lips) I've gotta go.<br> Did I do this? Screw it up?<br> Let's let it go now.<br> Has to be time.<br> Come be our CEO.<br> Yeah. Okay.<br> (both laughing)<br> - (snaps fingers)<br> - It was the stylus, John.<br> - What?<br> - I killed the Newton because of the stylus.<br> If you're holding a stylus, you can't use the<br> other five that are attached to your wrist.<br> Things we could have done together.<br> God, the things we could've done.<br> I'm paying your tuition.<br> Are you crazy? Of course<br> I'm paying your tuition.<br> I must have misunderstood you when<br> you said you weren't paying my tuition.<br> You and your mom selling the<br> house was a hostile thing to do.<br> She needed the money.<br> She always needs the money.<br> She needs a doctor. She<br> has a sinus infection.<br> She's had the same sinus<br> infection since 1988.<br> I'm gonna take care of my mother.<br> I'm sorry if that angers you.<br> It does anger me, because you're a kid<br> and it's not your job to<br> take care of your mother.<br> Is that how yours died?<br> Guys, step away, please,<br> and give them some room.<br> When your mom is 90 and can't feed herself,<br> you can take care of her.<br> But right now, she's 45, perfectly<br> healthy and can't feed herself.<br> You're supposed to work hard at<br> school and be 19, and that's it.<br> - I'll take care of your mother.<br> - Keep up the good work.<br> - What the hell do you want from me?<br> - I was sent for.<br> I bought her a house for $400,000.<br> It's worth twice that much today.<br> She sold it for two magic<br> rocks and a bowl of soup.<br> It was her house.<br> She used that money to<br> travel through Europe.<br> Money which you make her beg for.<br> - Steve...<br> - Don't even start with that.<br> Going to Andy and asking for the money?<br> That was so off-the-charts<br> over the line...<br> I did not do that. Andy came to me.<br> Everybody have an opinion on this?<br> I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,<br> you're going to be late.<br> She spends the money on antiques and then<br> sells them for a fraction of what she paid,<br> and she does it with money<br> I gave to her for you.<br> Steve...<br> You came to me hysterical when you were 13,<br> - asking if you could live with me...<br> - I was not hysterical.<br> because your mom was<br> screaming at you every day.<br> Thirteen was the second time I asked you.<br> The stress of her life<br> as a spiritual healer.<br> I don't believe I said you're a<br> bad guy. But if I did, I'm sorry.<br> Hey. Something happened to you at school,<br> some first semester core class that<br> all freshmen are required to take...<br> - I read Time.<br> - What?<br> I have Internet access at school.<br> I read an old copy of Time,<br> and I asked my mom some<br> questions about my family history.<br> That was...<br> Time wrote a<br> mangled piece of journal.<br> You were never supposed to read that.<br> I had two different Harvard statisticians<br> try to reverse-engineer the<br> equation that you came up with<br> to prove that 28% of American<br> men could be my father.<br> Honey, I...<br> You know, my mother might be a<br> troubled woman, but what's your excuse?<br> That's why I'm not impressed<br> with your story, Dad.<br> It's that you knew what<br> I was going through,<br> and you didn't do anything about it,<br> and that makes you an<br> unconscionable coward.<br> And not for nothing, but<br> "think" is a verb, all right,<br> making "different" an adverb.<br> You're asking people to think differently.<br> And you can talk about the Bauhaus movement<br> and Braun and "Simplicity<br> is sophistication"<br> and Issey Miyake uniforms and<br> Bob Dylan lyrics all you want,<br> but that thing looks like<br> Judy Jetson's Easy-Bake oven.<br> (exhales)<br> (applause)<br> Hey.<br> (stammers) You're gonna start late.<br> - You know what Lisa stood for?<br> - What?<br> The computer. The Lisa.<br> You know what it stood for?<br> I'm sorry I said that about the<br> iMac. It's not what I really think.<br> Behind my back, at the office,<br> you know what it stood for?<br> Local Integrated System<br> Architecture. I was five.<br> - Why couldn't you just lie?<br> - I did.<br> Of course it was named after you.<br> Local Integrated System Architecture<br> doesn't even mean anything.<br> Why'd you say it wasn't all those years?<br> I honestly don't know.<br> Why'd you say you weren't my father?<br> I'm poorly made.<br> - It's after 9:00. You're gonna be late.<br> - I don't care.<br> - You're writing for the Crimson.<br> - What?<br> The Apple chapter of the<br> Harvard Alumni Association<br> tells me you're writing<br> for the Crimson.<br> Oh. Yeah, a little bit. Essays.<br> - I'd like to read one.<br> - Sure.<br> No, I mean now. I'd like to<br> read one of your essays now.<br> Come on. You've got to go on stage.<br> The iMac will not be launched until<br> you give me one of your essays,<br> so the world is waiting for you.<br> JOANNA: I'm really sorry, guys.<br> Good luck.<br> I'm gonna put music in your pocket.<br> What?<br> Hundred songs. A thousand songs. 500 songs.<br> Somewhere between 500 and a<br> thousand songs right in your pocket,<br> 'cause I can't stand looking at<br> that inexplicable Walkman anymore.<br> You're carrying around a<br> brick playing cassette tape.<br> We're not savages.<br> So I'm gonna put a thousand<br> songs in your pocket.<br> - You can do that?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> (man) We'd get<br> soaked right through<br> We used to tell them<br> I was staying at yours<br> Sheltered in our own world<br> You want to watch from backstage?<br> Okay.<br> (vocalizing)<br> We grew up at midnight<br> Go cue one.<br> - We were only kids then<br> - (cheering, applause)<br> (man on speakers, indistinct)<br> Loving woman, loving man<br> Here for you, doing<br> the best we can<br> Hard to figure, hard to bear<br> Hard to think knowing<br> how much you care<br> It's the strangest thing<br> through thick and thin<br> All this time kept<br> the promise you made<br> If you're telling,<br> I'll be told<br> I'll come running and be<br> there as soon as I can<br> Outside of the window,<br> I was stuck on you<br> We were only kids then<br> I was staying at yours<br> You remember that painting<br> you did on the original Mac?<br> I do.<br> (man on speakers)<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> Steve Jobs.<br> (continues)<br> We grew up at midnight<br> We were only kids then<br> We grew up at midnight<br> We were only kids then<br> Woz.<br> But that night we knew<br> Whoo!<br> (continues)<br> (ends)<br> (acoustic guitar intro)<br> (Bob Dylan) 'Twas in another<br> lifetime, one of toil and blood<br> When blackness was a virtue,<br> the road was full of mud<br> I came in from the wilderness,<br> a creature void of form<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> And if I pass this way<br> again, you can rest assured<br> I'll always do<br> my best for her<br> On that, I give my word<br> In a world of<br> steel-eyed death<br> And men who are<br> fighting to be warm<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> Not a word was<br> spoke between us<br> There was little<br> risk involved<br> Everything up to that point<br> had been left unresolved<br> Try imagining a place where<br> it's always safe and warm<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> I was burned out<br> from exhaustion<br> Buried in the hail<br> Poisoned in the bushes<br> and blown out on the trail<br> Hunted like a crocodile,<br> ravaged in the corn<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> Suddenly I turned around<br> and she was standing there<br> With silver bracelets on her<br> wrists and flowers in her hair<br> She walked up to<br> me so gracefully<br> And took my crown of thorns<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> Now there's a<br> wall between us<br> Something there's been lost<br> I took too much for granted,<br> I got my signals crossed<br> Just to think that it all<br> began on an uneventful morn<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> Well, the deputy<br> walks on hard nails<br> And the preacher<br> rides a mount<br> But nothing really<br> matters much<br> It's doom alone that counts<br> And the one-eyed undertaker,<br> he blows a futile horn<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> I've heard newborn babies<br> wailing like a mourning dove<br> And old men with broken<br> teeth stranded without love<br> Do I understand<br> your question, man?<br> Is it hopeless and forlorn?<br> "Come in," she said, "I'll give<br> you shelter from the storm"<br> (harmonica)<br> (ends)<br>
