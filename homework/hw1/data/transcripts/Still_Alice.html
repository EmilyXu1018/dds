                        Okay... happy birthday mom.<br> - Oh, is that for me?<br> - Incredible. You don't look 40...<br> #much less 50.<br> Oh Charlie, please.<br> #But thank you. I appreciate it.<br> - Can I open this now?<br> - Yes open it, please.<br> #My goodness.<br> [Gasps] Oh.<br> - Oh I love it.<br> - Do you.<br> - Oh good. - This is so beautiful.<br> - You can exchange it if it doesn't fit.<br> - Oh no, I'm not going to.<br> - I absolutely love it. You always get me things...<br> - Good.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - Oh hey.<br> - Hey isn't uh, Lisa coming?<br> - No we split up.<br> I did notice that your status popped up<br> to single. Way to go.<br> I uh, forgot your present. I left it<br> in my locker.<br> That's ok. I hope you didn't spend<br> too much.<br> #Oh no, don't worry, he didn't.<br> Where have you been?<br> It was like a mad house. This one guy came<br> in with 6 stab wounds.<br> I swear one missed his heart by<br> seriously...<br> - No Tom, it's dinner time, please.<br> - Not yet it isn't.<br> #Hey.<br> So what kind of antibiotic did you use?<br> - Mom, have you spoken to Lydia?<br> - Yes.<br> She wanted to be here tonight but she<br> had a very important audition.<br> - What for?<br> - Um, a guest spot on some tv thing...<br> #"Something Enemy".<br> - Maybe this will be her big break.<br> - Uh huh. Yeah, maybe.<br> Don't hold your breath.<br> #Meow.<br> Stop it.<br> #You guys must have been something growing up.<br> I imagine dolls with heads cut off.<br> No, my sister and I were very close, actually.<br> No I was uh... I'm sorry I was talking about<br> Anna and Lydia.<br> Oh my goodness. I don't know why<br> I said that.<br> Well we're here to celebrate you, mom...<br> #so dad, what about a toast.<br> Dad, toast!<br> #Oh.<br> To the most beatiful and the most<br> intelligent woman...<br> - I've known in my entire life.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Happy birthday.<br> - [All] Happy birthday.<br> Cheers, darling.<br> [Narrating] My name is Frederick Johnson.<br> I'm associate professor of Cognitive<br> Science here at UCLA...<br> and I'm here to welcome our speaker<br> who just flew in from NY.<br> Now, in my dissertation I spent about<br> a chapter...<br> on how fairly vituperatively<br> citing today's guest...<br> in saying why I thought she was wrong.<br> For the record, every time Alice<br> and I have argued, she was right.<br> Alice Howland is the Lillian Young professor<br> of linguistics at Columbia University.<br> She famously wrote her seminal textbook...<br> from neurons to nouns while raising 3 children.<br> I'm sure getting more than a few "aha"<br> moments from them.<br> And it is now considered one of the<br> cornerstones...<br> of linguistics education all over the world.<br> Please, welcome, Dr. Alice Howland.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Most children speak and<br> understand their mother tongue...<br> before the age of 4 without lessons,<br> homework...<br> or much in the way of feedback.<br> #How they accomplish this remarkable feat...<br> well this is a question that's interested<br> scientists at least since Charles Darwin...<br> kept a diary of the alien language of<br> his infant son.<br> He observed man has an instinctive<br> tendency...<br> to speak as we see in the babble of<br> young children.<br> Much has been learned since then...<br> but today, I'd like to focus on some<br> recent studies from my lab...<br> on the acquisition of past tense<br> irregular verb forms...<br> in children between the ages of 18 months<br> and 2 1/2 years.<br> Now, you may say that this falls into<br> the great academic tradition...<br> of knowing more and more about<br> less and less...<br> until we know everything about nothing.<br> But I hope to convince you that by<br> observing these baby steps into the...<br> Into ugh...<br> I... I knew I shouldn't have had<br> that champagne.<br> Into the word stack of a given language...<br> we will learn crucial information about<br> the relationship between memory...<br> and computation that is the very<br> essence of communication.<br> Let's not.<br> [Party goers chatting]<br> [Party goers chatting]<br> [Party goer] Ok I'm gonna go down<br> and get Shel, I'll be right back.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> #You're just coming. I'm surprised.<br> Come on in, it's um, it's messy but<br> you know I was in the process of...<br> - cleaning.<br> - It's fine. Don't worry.<br> #The boys are total slobs.<br> The kitchen is the main battle ground...<br> but I've got them in training so we'll<br> see how that goes.<br> So uh, where are they? Working?<br> Doug's at Starbucks, Matthew has<br> some catering...<br> I guess that's what they mean by<br> working after, huh?<br> - Are you involved at the moment?<br> - Uh, Dougs dead and...<br> Malcom and I did have a thing but...<br> #it's over.<br> He got me into Open Space though.<br> - It's the best theater company. - It's a hole.<br> Oh thank you. Yeah, I'm done.<br> It would have been awesome if you saw it.<br> Daddie said you were really good.<br> Well, it wasn't my best night but at<br> least you could get a sense of it.<br> Figure out what I was doing.<br> - You know, do a solid for the company.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Um, this is really nice of him, to help out.<br> #How is he helping with the company?<br> It's our responsibility as members to...<br> to raise equity for the productions<br> we put on.<br> And then eventually we get a cut of<br> the box office and...<br> we're sort of shareholders.<br> #So basically you have to pay to act.<br> No, um, it's a theater group. That's<br> just the reality of the situation.<br> That's how it is here. It's Los Angeles.<br> Lydia, don't you think it's time you<br> reconsidered things?<br> You're so smart. There's so much more<br> you could be doing with your life.<br> - Like going to college?<br> - Yes, yes, like college.<br> Yeah like we've never talked about that<br> before. Every single day of my life.<br> I figured out what I wanted to do<br> and I'm doing it.<br> - It's a good thing.<br> - But on who's dime?<br> #You're helping Tom with med school.<br> - You helped Anna with law school.<br> - Sweetheart...<br> those are real careers. I just don't want<br> you to limit your choices.<br> - You want to make my choices.<br> - No I don't.<br> I'm, really happy.<br> I'm sorry I don't... I don't wanna<br> argue about this.<br> - Just forget I said anything, okay.<br> - Forgotten!<br> Is that your phone?<br> #That's just a game, your sister and I...<br> developed an obsession with<br> "Words With Friends".<br> #That's good.<br> You don't wanna play with her. She's<br> a demon.<br> #I'm not surprised.<br> John?<br> John?<br> John?<br> WHERE R U?<br> [Guy handing out flyers] Want one?<br> Here you go.<br> [Flyer guy hawking a sale]<br> [Flyer guy hawking a sale]<br> [Passers by background talking]<br> [Flyer guy hawking a sale]<br> Flyer?<br> - [John] Ali?<br> - I was wondering where you were.<br> - Don't, I'm really sweaty.<br> - How did it go?<br> - What?<br> - UCLA.<br> - Oh, it was good. They were um...<br> - They were really receptive.<br> - I'm sure they were.<br> - How was Lydia?<br> - Good, you know.<br> - Did you guys argue?<br> - Uh, well...<br> I spent the whole evening trying not to.<br> Um, I'd have to say the news that<br> your...<br> bankrolling her theater company<br> didn't exactly help.<br> - I told you about that.<br> - Uh uh.<br> - You didn't. - I thought I did.<br> - You didn't.<br> - Well, you're not gonna like this either...<br> but I still have a lot of things to<br> do at the lab...<br> so maybe you could walk me over<br> there right now.<br> #I don't wanna go back to campus.<br> I just went for a run I really need to<br> be home right now.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah I'm fine It's just you said we'd<br> spend the evening in.<br> I did and we will and the sooner I go...<br> the sooner I'll be back and we can<br> watch a movie.<br> I'm sorry. It's just exhausting.<br> Get some rest. Relax!<br> [Alice] I've started forgetting things. Little<br> annoying things like words and names.<br> And I got lost, completely lost, running<br> on campus.<br> I talked to my doctor about it and she said<br> it could be menopause...<br> the last time I had a period was in<br> February...<br> but then I had one again in September<br> right before my birthday so...<br> [Dr. Benjamin the Neurologist] Are you taking<br> any pills, medications, supplements?<br> Um, I take a multi-vitamin, flax<br> seed oil...<br> calcium, iron. I ocassionally take a<br> sleeping pill when I travel.<br> - Have you had any head injuries?<br> - No.<br> Would you consider yourself depressed<br> or under undue stress at the moment?<br> No, I work a lot but I thrive on it.<br> #How's your sleeping?<br> It's fine. Like 7 hours a night.<br> Now I'm gonna ask you to remember<br> a name and an address...<br> and then I'm gonna ask you for it<br> again later, okay?<br> #Ok.<br> "John Black, 42 Washington Street,<br> Hoboken"<br> Can you repeat that for me?<br> #"John Black, 42 Washington Street, Hoboken"<br> - Good. How old are you?<br> - I'm 50.<br> - What's today's date?<br> - November 26th.<br> #Where are we?<br> We are on the 3rd floor of the<br> New York Presbeterian.<br> - Can you spell water for me?<br> - W.A.T.E.R<br> - And can you spell it for me backwords?<br> - R.E.T.A.W<br> Tell me what you see on these cards.<br> Pliers, a ladder, a seahorse...<br> screwdriver, an elephant.<br> Tell me about your parents.<br> #Well they're both dead.<br> My mother and my sister died in a<br> car crash when I was 18...<br> and my father died in 1999<br> of liver failure.<br> #Hepatitis?<br> Chirosis. He was an alcoholic.<br> And what was he like towards the end?<br> Incoherent... incontinent.<br> Um, to tell the truth we didn't really<br> see a lot of each other.<br> He lived in New Hampsire and we<br> weren't that close.<br> Sorry. Do you have any other siblings?<br> No, I only had the one.<br> Now can you tell me that name and<br> address that I asked you to remember?<br> - Um, John Black...<br> - Uh huh, and the address?<br> Uh, damn it, I forgot.<br> Was it 42 Argyle Street, Cole Street,<br> Washington Street or South Street?<br> Um...<br> I was distracted talking about my parents.<br> Can we do that one again?<br> - There's no need to at this time.<br> - Okay.<br> So I'd like to do an MRI just to<br> rule some things out.<br> Like what, because I think I have<br> a brain tumor.<br> It's just a precaution. But it will<br> allow us...<br> to see if there are any lesions or any<br> signs of a stroke.<br> We can find out what is going on there.<br> Okay, um, what should I do in the<br> mean time?<br> You can get plenty of excercise so you<br> can get the blood pumping.<br> Drink lots of water. Good hydration is<br> excellent for the memory.<br> And the next time you come and see me, can<br> you bring someone who knows you well.<br> - Your husband or a close relative.<br> - Sure.<br> Stethoscope, millennium, hedgehog.<br> Cathode...<br> pomegranite, trellis.<br> - [Tom] Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> - Come on in.<br> - Hey mom.<br> #Good to see you.<br> - This is Jenny.<br> - Hello.<br> #I'm Alice. I'm so happy you could join us.<br> Thank you for having me.<br> Of course. Sweetheart, why don't you um,<br> guys go in there and get a drink...<br> and uh, grab the, the, uh cheese thing.<br> - I'm so happy you could join us, I really am.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It looks so good in here.<br> - Uh huh.<br> Ali did it.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, my god damn eggs.<br> #[Timer rings]<br> Cathode, pomegranite, trellis.<br> - Hey mom.<br> - Hi Lydia.<br> - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.<br> - How was your flight?<br> - Actually, awful.<br> This guy coughed all over me the<br> entire time.<br> #I hope you don't get sick.<br> - Does this mean what I think it means?<br> - Yes.<br> - Bread pudding? - Yes.<br> It's your favorite.<br> - [Annie] Mom. Merry Christmas. - Hi.<br> - Have you seen my latest words with friends?<br> - No honey I haven't had time.<br> - It's a real zinger.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Jealousy on a triple. - Hey.<br> It's already trending on twitter.<br> #How's California?<br> - Nice.<br> - Really? Warmer then here?<br> Yes, definitely warmer than here.<br> Here guys, uh, why don't you...<br> get out of here so I can concentrate<br> on making this.<br> - Where's dad?<br> - He's upstairs.<br> #Can I help you with anything?<br> Uh, no I'm fine. Just go get a<br> drink or something.<br> - Ok. It's going to be delicious.<br> - I hope so.<br> #It will be. I can't wait.<br> BREAD PUDDING RECIPE<br> It's a very big decision. We're excited.<br> The place was recommended by a couple<br> of friends who have being trying for years.<br> And they just had their first child so...<br> #So we'll see.<br> I've heard good things about Well Spring.<br> #Good. It's expensive, but we...<br> obviously want it to work.<br> - You could be a mom already, it's crazy. - I know.<br> - What kind of soup mom?<br> - It's butternut squash.<br> Hi, I'm Alice. I'm so happy you joined us.<br> - I'm Jenny.<br> - It's really nice to meet you.<br> - Well... - Yeah, um.<br> I think I deserve a glass of wine<br> after all that, don't you.<br> - Merlot?<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you. Does everyone have a glass? - [Anna]Yes we do.<br> Let's have a toast...<br> - To Christmas.<br> - [All] Merry Christmas.<br> [Neurosurgeon] Now I don't see anything<br> abnormal in your MRI.<br> No cerebral vascular disease...<br> #no evidence of any strokes. No masses.<br> Thank god.<br> #And your blood work came back completely clear.<br> But what worries me are the memory<br> tests that I sent you for.<br> You have sporadic memory impairement...<br> #totally out of proportion to your age.<br> And there is evidence of decline in your<br> level of mental function.<br> So I think we should do a PET scan.<br> #It's similar to an MRI...<br> but it can pick up things at the<br> molecular level...<br> #I know what a PET scan is.<br> What in particular would you be<br> looking for?<br> I want to see if the results are consistent<br> with Alzheimer's disease.<br> That would be rare for someone as<br> young as yourself...<br> but you do fit the criteria.<br> Now last time I asked you to bring<br> in a close relative.<br> I really didn't think that would<br> be necessary.<br> Okay, but next time for sure, okay?<br> Enhancement of endogenous levels of<br> beta endorphin...<br> has not so far been shown to reduce<br> the incidence...<br> of metastisis in the distinct cell sites.<br> #That's not good.<br> Tell me about it.

John!<br> - but they can't prevent the disease.<br> The thing is, that the type of<br> Alzheimers I have...<br> is... very rare.<br> It's familial.<br> - It's passed on genetically.<br> - My god.<br> We believe that she got it from her father...<br> and of course we're very worried,<br> about the three of you.<br> But there is a test you can take.<br> But it's completely up to you<br> whether you want to find out or not.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm so...<br> Can anyone tell me what it says in<br> the syllabus for today?<br> [Student] Phonology?<br> #And can anyone tell me what Phonology is?<br> "Phono" is from the Greek word "phone"...<br> #meaning sound.<br> Phonology is the study...<br> of the sounds of the language which should be<br> carefully distinguished from phonetics.<br> - Hi Anna.<br> - [Anna on phone] Hello.<br> Are you okay?<br> I got the results.

But<br> I'm positive.<br> Baby how are you feeling?<br> I'm okay.<br> One good thing, at least I found out<br> now before the next IUI testing.<br> I guess there's a way they can test<br> the embryo so...<br> they can make sure the baby's gonna be ok.<br> Anna where are you? I'm on my way to<br> a lecture...<br> but I can cancel it and I can be<br> right there.<br> No mom, it's okay. I'm tired.

I ended up<br> just following the online version.<br> I found linguistics 201 very erratic...<br> I had a hard time following Dr. Howlands<br> lectures...<br> Even she seems like she gets lost in them.<br> Eric, I am so sorry I...<br> I didn't know the students...<br> felt this way.

Was it "East St",<br> "Washington St", "Humboldt St"...<br> or "Main Street" ?<br> Just to jump in here, we're both concerned<br> about the rate of deterioration.<br> Is that normal?<br> #Every case is different.<br> With Familial Early Onset, things<br> can go fast.<br> And actually with people who have a<br> high level of education...<br> things can go faster.<br> Often they've managed to sustain their mental<br> processes through innovative means and...<br> that delays diagnosis.<br> Clearly Alice's memory is failing but she's<br> still incredibly resourceful.<br> Thank you.<br> #I know, you're discouraged.<br> But sometimes I've seen patients plateau<br> even at this point.<br> Don't lose hope.<br> Alice, I read your name in the Alzheimers<br> Association Care Conference brochure.<br> You're gonna give a speech.<br> - Will you be there?<br> - Yes, I'm looking forward to it.<br> I'm going to be away on business<br> in Minnesota and...<br> I'm worried. Are you sure this is<br> a good idea?<br> Considering the state that she's in, she's<br> gonna be under a lot of stress.<br> I think it'll be great for her.<br> I'm sure everything will be fine. You're<br> not worried about it are you Alice?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> While these ways to prevent the production<br> of Amyloid are being tried...<br> There is a new study that combines base<br> and gamma secretase inhibitors...<br> and this is one of our best<br> hopes for the future.<br> That's it, that's the end.<br> [Lydia on computer] Good mom, good.<br> Very scientific.<br> - Yes, well, you know.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'm sure it's valid... but um...<br> - But what?<br> You need to make it a bit more personal.<br> I don't understand what you mean<br> by personal.<br> You know. You're not speaking to<br> a room of scientists.<br> What I wanna know really is like...<br> how you feel. What does it feel like. What<br> is the disease doing to you.<br> You weren't listening because that's all<br> there. That's in the speech.<br> Okay. Don't ask me then.<br> Oh no, then I won't ask... then.<br> Hey... mom... give it more thought, okay?<br> I can't because I have done it already!<br> #[Lydia] Huh?<br> I... I use this... yellow thingy to<br> mark it...<br> so I don't have to read the same line...<br> over and over and over and over again.<br> Got it, totally. Print out one more.<br> Do you know that it took me 3 days to<br> write this?!<br> - You can print out one more.<br> - No it took me... three... days.<br> - Sorry.<br> - 3 days! [Alice hangs up]<br> - [Usher] Here you are.<br> - [Alice] Thank you.<br> Hi.<br> - [Dr. Benjamin] Hello there.<br> - [Tom] Hello.<br> Hi oh uh, Tom this is my doctor. This<br> is my son Tom.<br> Travis Benjamin. I'm your mothers<br> neurologist.<br> #This is my son Tom.<br> So, how you feeling Alice.<br> - I think I'm nervous.<br> - You're gonna do great.<br> - Break a leg. Nice meeting you.<br> - Yeah.<br> [Emcee] It is a great honor to welcome<br> our next speaker, Alice Howland.<br> A former professor of Linguistics at<br> Columbia...<br> she's written textbooks and has<br> lectured all over the world.<br> Alice is living with Early Onset Alzheimers...<br> with the care and support of her<br> loving family.<br> Please welcome Alice Howland.<br> Please give me... just a minute.<br> Good morning.<br> #It's an honor to be here.<br> The Poet, Elizabeth Bishop, once wrote:<br> "The art of losing isn't hard to master..."<br> "so many things seem filled with the<br> intent to be lost..."<br> "that their loss is no disaster".<br> I am not a poet. I'm a person living<br> with Early Onset Alzheimers.<br> And as that person, I find myself learning<br> the art of losing... every day.<br> Losing my bearings, losing objects...<br> losing sleep, but mostly...<br> #losing memories.<br> [Alice exclaims] Oh.<br> Um...<br> I think I'll try to forget that<br> just happened.<br> All my life, I've accumulated memories.<br> They've become in a way, my most<br> precious possessions.<br> The night I met my husband...<br> the first time I held my texbook<br> in my hands...<br> having children... making friends...<br> travelling the world.<br> Everything I've accumulated in life,<br> everything I've worked so hard for...<br> now all that is being ripped away.<br> As you can imagine, or as you know,<br> this is hell.<br> But it gets worse.<br> Who can take us seriously when we are<br> so far from who we once were.<br> Our strange behavior and fumbled<br> sentences...<br> change others perceptions of us...<br> and our perception of ourselves.<br> We become ridiculous... incapable...<br> comic.<br> But this is not who we are.<br> #This is our disease.<br> And like any disease, it has a cause...<br> it has a progression, and it could<br> have a cure.<br> My greatest wish, is that my children...<br> Our children, the next generation...<br> do not have to face what I am facing.<br> But for the time being I'm still alive.<br> I know I'm alive.<br> #I have people I love dearly.<br> I have things I want to do with my life.<br> I rail against myself for not being able<br> to remember this.<br> But I still have moments in the day<br> of pure happiness and joy.<br> And please do not think that I am<br> suffering.<br> I am not suffering. I am struggling.<br> Struggling to be a part of things.<br> To stay connected to who I once was.<br> So live in the moment I tell myself.<br> #It's really all I can do.<br> Live in the moment.<br> And not beat myself up to much.<br> And not...<br> beat myself up too much for<br> mastering the art of losing.<br> One thing I will try to hold onto though,<br> is the memory of speaking here today.<br> It will go... I know it will... it<br> may be gone by tomorrow.<br> But it means so much...<br> to be talking here, today....<br> like my old ambitious self who was so<br> fascinated by communication.<br> Thank you for this opportunity.<br> It means the world to me.<br> Thank you.<br> [John] It's the Mayo Clinic.<br> #It'll start up next spring.<br> And I'll be heading up my own team.<br> So you want us to move to...<br> It's in Rochester Minnesota.<br> It could be a whole new adventure for<br> us. You might even like it there.<br> Every thing I know is here. Anna, Tom<br> and the babies, that are coming.<br> It's just a 2 hour flight. We'd see<br> them as often as we do now.<br> Ali, this just came up and they haven't<br> even made a formal offer...<br> but don't you see, this is it.<br> They're working on so many cutting edge<br> treatments, they've got so many resources.<br> I understand that work is important. I<br> miss working.<br> I think you should ask them if you<br> can start in a year.<br> It's not academia. They don't give<br> sabbaticals.<br> But to pick up and move right when, when...<br> when... [makes exasperated sound]<br> [Alice] Why can't I say what I wanna say?!<br> Ali one way or the other we'll still<br> be together.<br> So... no time off?!<br> I can't take a year off. Financially<br> that's not an option.<br> And god knows where we'll be<br> further down the line.<br> That's it then. That's it.<br> - What?<br> - Well you don't want that.<br> A year... at home... with me,<br> watching this.<br> - I didn't say that.<br> - You didn't have to.<br> WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR<br> OLDEST DAUGHTER?<br> ANNE...<br> [BACKSPACES OVER THE E AND TYPES A]<br> WHAT MONTH IS YOUR BIRTHDAY?<br> O-H-C-T-O-B-R<br> Hon, what are you doing!?<br> - I can't find it! - Can't find what?!<br> - I can't find my phone!<br> - It's the middle of the night!<br> The thing's important. It goes off at 8 O'clock<br> in the morning...<br> and asks me these questions.<br> - I have to find it!<br> - We'll look for it in the morning.<br> - No, I have to find it!<br> - We'll look for it...<br> - Help me find my phone!!<br> - I'll help you find it tomorrow, I promise you.<br> - Help me...<br> - Tomorrow, tomorrow.<br> - No! I want it...<br> - I'll help you find it tomorrow.<br> - Help me find it!<br> I promise you I'll find it, so come<br> to bed with me.<br> Come... come to bed with me please.<br> Please.<br> #Okay.<br> Come on.<br> #[John talking on phone in background]<br> [Anna] Hey.<br> - Anne?<br> - [John in background] I look forward...<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey momma.<br> #Hey.<br> It's Anna, mom<br> - I thought you were my sister.<br> - It's okay.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - Ugh, so uncomfortable.<br> Can't breathe, can't sleep, was it like<br> this for you?<br> - I didn't have 2 at a time.<br> - [Anna] This is true.<br> [John] Did you get the grey kind?<br> - I did. It's right here. - Great.<br> Everything on track?<br> #Yes, they made a very generous offer.<br> - Oh, that's great.<br> - I guess.<br> No it is. It's absolutely the right<br> decision.<br> - [John] Would you like some water?<br> - [Anna] Yes, please.<br> John what happened? Who was<br> on the phone?<br> Uh, that was that hospital honey,<br> the Mayo Clinic.<br> Is someone sick?<br> #No, nothings wrong. Everything's absolutely fine.<br> Oh my god.<br> [Alice gasps]<br> Oh no.<br> I was looking for that last night.<br> [John Whispers] It was a month ago.<br> [John] Ali.<br> #Hon.<br> Wake up crabby. It's time to wake up.<br> Time to get dressed. I'm gonna help you.<br> [John] Got some very good news for you.<br> I'm gonna help you with your pants, ok.<br> [Mumbles] I want my green one.<br> No I think this one will be really nice.<br> Let's put that one on.<br> [Alice] Okay.<br> - Lean on me.<br> - Uh huh.<br> [John] Hold on.<br> Well there she is.<br> - What's the matter with her? Is she?<br> - She just delivered the baby, hon.<br> Hi. You had your baby.<br> Yes I did.<br> - This is Alison.<br> - [John] They're so beautiful.<br> #And that's Charlie Junior.<br> This is little Charlie.<br> #Yes.<br> There you go.<br> #Can I hold her?<br> Uh, is that a good idea?<br> I know how to hold a baby.<br> That's okay. Mom, you can sit right<br> there on that chair.<br> [Anna] There, that's good.<br> Something tells me you've done<br> this before.<br> She looks like you.<br> [John in the background] There are days<br> when she knows where she is...<br> but there are just as many days when<br> she doesn't.<br> Maybe she thinks she's a child<br> back in New Hampshire...<br> #or who knows.<br> It's happening more and more<br> [Tom] I just... I keep thinking about<br> what she said in that speech, you know...<br> how important her memories are. Who<br> she is.<br> [Anna] Yes. That was months ago.<br> [John] Guys, this is difficult, for all of us.<br> But it's important to remember...<br> who Alice was. She would not want<br> to be a burden.<br> Now Anna, you have the babies and you<br> wanna go back to work...<br> and you're not in a position to care for her,<br> not seriously Tom.<br> And I can't keep Mayo waiting. The<br> beginning of this month, I am gone.<br> Now I want to take her with me.<br> I will get her the best possible care.<br> And once she's adjusted to Minnesota...<br> She will be happier for it and so<br> will all of us.<br> - Lydia's having a fit.<br> - So let her.<br> - Well she is.<br> - Well, she has no right to.<br> If she cares she wouldn't be on the<br> other side of the country.<br> Hot in here.<br> [Alice] Who is he exactly?<br> His name is Bill Compton. He's the manager.<br> Why is he so important?<br> He'll open doors for me.<br> You know, get me into auditions that I<br> wouldn't be able to get into.<br> Got me some good head shots.<br> #I see.<br> What's his name?<br> #Uh, Bill Compton.<br> He's with Compton Gold. If you wanna<br> look them up, their good.<br> Kettles boiling.<br> Where's Elena?<br> - I'm making myself a cup of tea.<br> - Cool.<br> Where's your caretaker?<br> Elena's not here today. Her daughter's sick.<br> She's at the doctor.<br> You're alone?!<br> I can make myself a cup of tea.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> #Do you wanna check out my headset?<br> I'll send you a link. Can you open the<br> file, download a file?<br> Yes.<br> Okay.<br> #[Sound of file being delivered on Skype]<br> Okay, yeah, um...<br> - I'll do it for you, okay. I love you.<br> - Fine.<br> - Bye. - Bye.<br> [Sound of Skype signing off]<br> BUTTERFLY MOVIE<br> [Alice in movie] Hi.<br> Alice, I'm you and I have something<br> very important to say to you.<br> Um...<br> I guess you've reached that point where<br> you can't answer any of the questions.<br> So this is the next logical step.<br> I'm sure of it.<br> Because what's happened to you...<br> the, you know the Alzheimers, you could<br> see it as tragic, but...<br> your life has been anything but tragic.<br> You have had a remarkable career...<br> and a great marriage.<br> And three beautiful children.<br> Uh, listen to me, um...<br> This is important.<br> Make sure that you're alone,<br> and go to your bedroom.<br> In your bedroom there's a dresser with<br> a blue lamp.<br> Open the top drawer...<br> in the back of the drawer there's a<br> bottle with pills in it.<br> It says take all pills with water.<br> Now there are a lot of pills in that bottle...<br> but it's very important that you<br> swallow them all.<br> Okay?<br> And then...<br> lie down...<br> and go to sleep.<br> And don't tell anyone, what you're<br> doing... okay?<br> [Movie replaying] In your bedroom there's<br> a dresser with a blue lamp.<br> Open the top drawer, in the back of the<br> drawer there's a bottle with pills in it.<br> It says take all pills with water.<br> [Mumbling the instructions to herself]<br> [Continues mumbling] ... blue lamp...<br> [Movie replays] Make sure that you're alone,<br> and go to your bedroom.<br> In your bedroom there's<br> a dresser with a blue lamp.<br> Open the top drawer, in the back of the<br> drawer there's a bottle with pills in it.<br> It says take all pills with water.<br> Now there are a lot of<br> pills in that bottle...<br> but it's very important that you<br> swallow them all.<br> Okay?

Chase the<br> moon across America.<br> God! Its been years since I was on a plane.<br> When we hit 35,000 feet we'll have reached<br> the tropopause...<br> The great belt of calm air.<br> As close as Ill ever get to the ozone.<br> I dreamed we were there.<br> The plane leapt the tropopause...<br> the safe air and attained the outer rim...<br> the ozone which was ragged and torn...<br> patches of it threadbare as old cheesecloth<br> and that was...<br> frightening.<br> But I saw something only I could see...<br> because of my astonishing ability to see such things.<br> Souls were rising...<br> from the earth far below...<br> souls of the dead of people whod<br> perished from...<br> famine, from war, from the plague...<br> and they floated up like skydivers in reverse.<br> limbs all akimbo, wheeling and spinning.<br> And the souls of these departed<br> joined hands...<br> clasped ankles and formed a web,<br> a great net of souls.<br> And the souls were three atom oxygen<br> molecules of the stuff of ozone...<br> and the outer rim absorbed them<br> and was repaired.<br> Nothings lost forever.<br> In this world, there is a kind of<br> painful progress.<br> Longing for what weve left behind and...<br> dreaming ahead.<br> At least I think thats so<br> That's it.<br> Hey.<br> Did you like that?<br> Hmm, what I just read.<br> #Did you hate it?<br> [Alice mumbles incoherently]<br> [Alice continues mumbling]<br> What...<br> What was it about?<br> Love.<br> #Love.<br> Yeah mom.<br> It was about love.<br> The End @<br> STILL ALICE<br>
