I want to ask the price of this goblet.<br> For this? 1 0,000 liras.<br> It is aging.<br> May l?<br> Please.<br> It is very beautiful.<br> It is a very beautiful color.<br> Perhaps you'll see the color better<br> if you took off your glasses.<br> Are you enjoying Venice?<br> Yes, I have, very much.

That about concludes<br> my entire performance in ltalian.<br> Should I call somebody for you?<br> Who?<br> I don't know. Mrs. Fiorini?<br> I scarcely know her.<br> Do you want to go somewhere?<br> No.<br> I came to see you.<br> Oh, you found another goblet.<br> No. Unfortunately, no.<br> There are not many old goblets<br> in Venice any more. But we'll look.<br> Don't go for any trouble.<br> For you? It is no trouble.<br> May we go in?<br> Sure.<br> It's very hot.<br> Yes.<br> That's better, isn't it?<br> Mr. Rossi, why did you come to see me?<br> It is of nature.<br> You don't give up something you like.<br> No.<br> So I came.<br> Why?<br> Does it matter why? You knew I would.<br> I did not.<br> How can I explain?<br> May be it's my English.<br> May be it's mine.<br> Listen. Two nights ago I went to<br> Piazza St. Marco. You were there.<br> We looked. Next day, you were in my shop.<br> We talked about glasses.<br> We talked about Venice.<br> But we were not speak about that. Are we?<br> So last night I was in St.Marco again.<br> You were at St. Marco again.<br> Half of Venice are at St. Marco again.<br> But half of Venice are not in my shop,<br> or I'll be a rich man.<br> I wanted to buy another glass.<br> That's all<br> There are shops all over Venice.<br> Did you looking<br> at any of them for your glass?<br> No.<br> You see?<br> But you said you'll find one for me.<br> That's why you came back?<br> Yes.<br> Not that reason.<br> I don't know what your experience<br> has been with American tourists.<br> My experience has been that<br> tourist have more experience than l.<br> Can we sit down?<br> No.<br> I've offended you?<br> Oh, yes. You're sorry I'm here.<br> Then you're glad?<br> It may be so to you, but I'm not<br> an ltalian. I'm an American,<br> I thought everything<br> happens so fast in America.<br> Not this sort of thing. Not to me.<br> Yes. I have offended you.<br> Mr. Rossi, I'm not a child.<br> But I don't understand.<br> Understand? Why must you understand?<br> The most beautiful things<br> in life are those we don't understand.<br> As we spoke yesterday,<br> I knew you're simpatico.<br> Is that something you understand?<br> Yes, it means I'm like a sister to you.<br> I have four sisters<br> and I'm not looking for another.<br> Stop. You can make a joke.<br> You make many jokes but inside.<br> I think you can.<br> That's why you're simpatico.<br> Miss. Hudson,<br> you ask me why I came to see you.<br> Because you attract me. Why?<br> Because you do.<br> You Americans<br> are even more suspicious than French.<br> Listen. We saw each other.<br> We like each other.<br> This is so nice.<br> How can it be wrong?<br> Would you do me the honor<br> of seeing me this evening?<br> Hello! Miss. Hudson. What a day we have.<br> We've been shopping.<br> No, let them guess.<br> This is Mr. Rossi.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Mcllenny.<br> How are you?<br> Fine, thank you.<br> It's so nice to be ltalian in ltaly.<br> Glad to know you, Mr. Rossi.<br> How do you do?<br> It's hot. I guess<br> we kind of overrun our schedule.<br> What did you buy?<br> Glass, glass and more glass.<br> She even sent home a chandelier.<br> And before that, we did<br> the glass factory, picture gallery, the<br> whole works. The pictures were marvelous<br> you tell them.<br> Yes, she is right.<br> That place certainly sold me art.<br> It gotta be fine art.<br> Oh, yes.<br> That you gotta see, Miss. Hudson.<br> Come rain or snow, you gotta see.<br> Oh boy, pictures. Rooms full of pictures.<br> Hundreds of pictures. All done by hand.<br> And the cuttest glass.<br> C'mon, I just gotta show you.<br> Over there, so pretty, Lloyd.<br> What are they?<br> Benetian glass.<br> Please don't bother to unwrap it.<br> It'no bother. I'll show you one.<br> And you gotta do this please.<br> You stand right there and watch them<br> They put this stuff on long poles<br> and they heat it to the furnace.<br> And presto change glass! And such colors.<br> You have no idea. There!<br> Isn't that exquisite?<br> Stunning!<br> Oddly enough.<br> I was looking for one just like it.<br> They're only too<br> happy to make them for you.<br> I bought half a dozen.<br> They practically making them<br> for you while you stand there.<br> If I may ask, how much did you pay?<br> Not too much.<br> Lloyd, honestly.<br> You know they wanted 1 1,500 lira a piece<br> But you never give them<br> what they want.<br> You just beat them down every time....<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> No, ltalians love to bargain.<br> How much did you pay finally?<br> Well, 1 0,000.<br> It's fair.<br> Oh we missed something.<br> We never got around the National Library.<br> We can get that over with<br> in morning before we catch the train.<br> Sometimes I think the schedule<br> in Venice is just, well, all wrong.<br> There you go.<br> Why! Thank you.<br> (ltalian)<br> I know a little shop where<br> Mrs. Mcllenny could've saved 7,800 lira.<br> I didn't say<br> your glass which was made yesterday.<br> Of course not. It was 1 8 century, cookie.<br> Do not call me cookie.<br> It's politer than some<br> other names that come to mind.<br> Now you're angry.<br> No.<br> Suspicious again.<br> Angry, no. Suspicious, yes.<br> You can always<br> find something to be suspicious of.<br> Well I can and this doesn't help.<br> Suspicious.....<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Benetian glass<br> the same design used over and over<br> for years and years.<br> Your goblet is aging centuries.<br> You can't believe me, you're not.<br> Now please, believe me.<br> If you do me the honor<br> of taking confidant tonight?<br> There is a concert tonight.<br> Would you like to go?<br> He is beginning music with someone.<br> Relax.<br> Relax and the world is beautiful.<br> Take a deep breath.<br> There.<br> There is not very much<br> to have confidence in me, is it?<br> No.<br> What happens after that.....happens.<br> Does not happen.<br> This is all and<br> more than I ever dreamed of.<br> Back in Akron.<br> You're a surprising person.<br> Surprising?<br> Uh-hum.<br> Every woman should<br> surprise a man at least once<br> How many times have I surprised you?<br> I think you surprise me all the time.<br> Sometimes, you surprise me.<br> Pleasantly?<br> Well....<br> Here is, to many pleasant surprises.<br> Which flower do you prefer?<br> Which one do you think I should have?<br> Choose.<br> I think I know which one you choose<br> You do? Perhaps I might surprise you.<br> Perhaps. Choose.<br> Perhaps not.<br> Surprised?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> Thank you.<br> Which flower<br> did you think I would choose?<br> The rose? the carnation?<br> Oh, dear, I should've known.<br> For once, I wasn't the touring American.<br> Why did you choose that flower?<br> I once went to a ball.<br> Not just the ordinary dance,<br> but a real ball.<br> It was the first one I ever been to.<br> Somehow, I got it into my mind<br> that I had to wear gardenia.<br> I don't know why.<br> I guess I read about<br> gardenia in a book or something.<br> I must have it.<br> I didn't even know what to wear.<br> Did you wear one?<br> Gardenias turned out<br> to cost two dollars a piece.<br> And the boy I was<br> going with was still in college.<br> It was nice theme.<br> Well, now you have your gardenia.<br> Yes.<br> Everything happens sooner or later.<br> Yes. That's what they say.<br> Everything happens to him who waits.<br> Let's take a walk.<br> Alright.<br> That's where I was born.<br> You see the window?<br> With a basket of flowers?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Sixty four steps up. I used to count them.<br> That was a lot of steps.<br> It's still is.<br> I went back there a year ago.<br> What are they doing?<br> Is it a festival or something?<br> No. They're just having fun.<br> They'll have supper somewhere<br> on the canal. They'll sing songs.<br> Look the stars, and perhaps,<br> Well, it is dark on the canal.<br> I'll catch it from the steps.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Oh, Renato!<br> You're home.<br> Say it again.<br> Say what?<br> My name.<br> Why did you do that?<br> Why!<br> Yes. Why did you do that? Like that.<br> I don't think I want to see you again.<br> You don't?<br> Oh, but l......<br> I love you.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Eight.<br> Hey! Lady.<br> You're supposed to<br> come this morning. Remember?<br> I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.<br> If you're really sorry<br> you buy Swiss watch, 1 0 dollars.<br> I must fly.<br> Where're you going?<br> I have an appointment.<br> Take my cordo. Lady.<br> I must've forgotten that, too.<br> Crazy!<br> (ltalian)<br> Do you really think so?<br> Yes, Yes.<br> Miss. Hudson.<br> Oh, it's you.<br> Good evening. I bring a message.<br> Mr. Rossi can't make it.<br> Oh no, he'll be here.<br> But he must be little late.<br> It was very nice<br> of you to come and tell me.<br> Not at all.<br> Won't you have some coffee?<br> No, thank you.<br> Please sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> Cigarette?<br> American?<br> Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> American cigarettes are marvelous.<br> But I'll save it for later,<br> if you don't mind. Permit me.<br> Do you like working for Mr. Rossi?<br> Very much.<br> Do you think he is a nice man?<br> Yes. He is great..Iike God, for you, too.<br> You don't know how upset<br> he was when he knew you'd be late.<br> He didn't want to be.<br> My youngest sister, she was little ill,<br> It was nothing really,<br> he worries so much about the same thing.<br> He does.<br> Always.<br> He worries about whose children?<br> His. Us.<br> Us? Who are us?<br> I'm the oldest. Vito.<br> And how is your mother?<br> Fine. Thank you.<br> So am l. Except the hole in my head.<br> Excuse me, please. My English is not....<br> Sorry. I think you better<br> tell your father not to come.<br> But it won't be long.<br> No, no, it's alright.<br> Just tell him not to come.<br> Perhaps I tell him tomorow night.<br> No. Thank you for your trouble.<br> Good-by.<br> Good-by.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, hello.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Marriage troubles.<br> I wish I had them. Matter of fact, I do.<br> Here you go.<br> Thanks.<br> Cry again.<br> You cry. I'm sunk.<br> Not you.<br> Not me!? I'm feeling miserable.<br> But everybody loves you.<br> I know.<br> They do.<br> I don't want everybody.<br> I can't handle the crowd.<br> I can't even handle.....Here I go again.<br> Everything goes crazy for me.<br> Everything always is crazy.<br> I got to be everything.<br> You got to be everything?<br> Is that crazy?<br> Yeah, that's crazy. Two of you, cookie.<br> What do you mean?<br> Two. That's lovely isn't......<br> Don't push your luck too far.<br> Everything doesn't go crazy,<br> you just ask too much.<br> What's the matter? What did I say?<br> Nothing. I'm teribly sorry.<br> Nothing. It's me.<br> Something happened to you?<br> No, no, nothing happened to me.<br> That's my history.<br> Have stale potato chips.<br> Listen. I don't love you.<br> Who asked?<br> It was very pleasant time we had.<br> Mauro!<br> Gondola.<br> Where did you get that for?<br> It's mine.<br> Where did you get that for? That's dirty.<br> I want it.<br> Is that what you do? Is that your work?<br> What's matter? What's matter?<br> Stop that! you hear? You stop that!<br> What did he do?<br> That was too...he is just a baby, a child.<br> I thought you like the child.<br> What's matter? You crazy?<br> Something happens to this city at night.<br> Are you going to get away from Venice?<br> Your friend with in Kansas City.<br> Not in a gondola.<br> That's ungratitude Venice.<br> Jane.<br> Don't call me Jane.<br> Miss. Hudson, you're shocked.<br> Disappointed.<br> No, shocked.<br> I don't like dishonesty.<br> You're not his wife.<br> Why didn't you tell me you're married?<br> I see.<br> Why?<br> Why?<br> I was afraid.<br> I was afraid if you knew too soon,<br> It'll end us before we begin.<br> Now, I'm afraid I was right.<br> No wonder<br> you approve of that sort of thing.<br> Approve?<br> What Ms. Fiorini does is not my business.<br> She leaves, I leave. I approve of leaving<br> Pretending everything is fine and dandy,<br> Just because you want to do it.<br> You Americans get so disturbed about sex.<br> We don't take it lightly.<br> Take it, don't talk it.<br> My wife and I don't live together.<br> Why?<br> Why? It is an arrangement.<br> Does your wife have friends?<br> Naturally.<br> Gondola friends?<br> No.<br> You're shocked.<br> No. Disappointed.<br> No. Shocked.<br> Your sense of humor is coming back. Good.<br> I'm sorry, yours is leaving.<br> Listen to me.

Not rich. Not witty<br> And married, of course.<br> I'm a man and you're a woman.<br> Don't you see? It's wrong.<br> That's the way it is.<br> You're like a hungry child.<br> Was given ravioli to eat.<br> No, you say, I want beefsteak.<br> My dear girl, you're hungry.<br> Eat that ravioli.<br> I'm not that hungry.<br> We're all the time, Miss. Hudson.<br> There is noise in your head.<br> Be quiet. Let it happen.<br> I want it to happen.<br> I want it to happen.<br> Don't you think I do?<br> Then?<br> It's just.....<br> Isn't the way I thought it would be.<br> I'm sorry.<br> But l...come from<br> such a different world, and I'm not<br> Going to be here long.<br> So it is better<br> to take home when you have it.<br> If you really not so hungry,<br> you do that very well.<br> Do l?<br> Yes.<br> Let me take you outside.<br> No.<br> Please.<br> No. I'm gonna go for a walk alone.<br> Please leave me alone.<br> It is very difficult.<br> Let me take you to a drink.<br> No.<br> At least something to eat.<br> No.<br> There are fireworks tonight.<br> I don't care.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> I'm afraid it is.<br> Gondola, sir?<br> No.<br> Do you know the words?<br> Yes. This song says....<br> I know what it says.<br> Have you ever had it in America?<br> No.<br> You sing it.<br> How do you know I can?<br> Because you're ltalian.<br> (ltalian)<br> They call it Fangela Coppoli.<br> What does that mean?<br> The island where the rainbow fell.<br> It's very late. We ought to go.<br> Are you asleep?<br> Fast asleep.<br> You slept all day yesterday.<br> True<br> You sleep all day and<br> you don't want to sleep at night.<br> You promised to take me to see<br> sights and now it's too late.<br> I'll take you tomorrow.<br> You promise?<br> No.<br> Now, do you promise?<br> It is difficult.<br> If you don't, I'll never kiss you again.<br> Yes, you will.<br> Yes. I guess so.<br> They're getting to know us.<br> You asked them to play it.<br> I did.<br> You're far away.<br> I'm very close.<br> What are you thinking?<br> I was thinking<br> the first evening I came here.<br> First time I saw you,<br> you were wearing that yellow tie.<br> I don't want to forget any of it.<br> Not a single moment.<br> I don't think I ever shall.<br> I could go for a little walk.<br> Take us somewhere quiet.<br> Somewhere that is you.<br> I think you're going to surprise me again.<br> Listen, Renato. I'm leaving today.<br> I'm all packed.<br> My train leaves in two hours.<br> I don't believe you.<br> You have to believe me, because it's true.<br> What have I done?<br> Nothing.<br> What made you change your mind?<br> Well...I hadn't a mind change.<br> Really, I just found it.<br> I haven't made you unhappy.<br> No. You haven't. It's the happiest<br> time I had in my whole life.<br> You must believe that, please.<br> Why throw it away?<br> Because we have to. Because it's wrong.<br> Because you and l<br> will only end in nothing.<br> I love you, Jane.<br> You don't have to say that.<br> I mean it.<br> I shall always love you.<br> Yes. If I go.....<br> All my life, I stayed<br> at parties too long, because<br> I didn't know when to go.<br> Now with you, I've grown up.<br> I think I do know when to.<br> I can't bear it if you go today.<br> I can't bear it, either.<br> Just a few days.<br> No. I couldn't. Then I never go.<br> Please. No. Take me to the station.<br> Oh, no no, please. Please help me.<br> Let me go by myself.<br> Don't go, please.<br> Please don't go.<br> Let me go.<br> I must catch that train.<br> I'll take you to the station.<br> No, that's just what<br> I don't want you to do.<br> Oh, Renato.<br> Mauro!<br> What are you doing here?<br> I come to say good-by.<br> I'm sorry, Mauro, I'm very, very sorry.<br> Ok, ok.<br> You going to Rome?<br> I'm going home.<br> To America?<br> Yes.<br> You come back again?<br> Yeah, yeah, sure.<br> You come back with a big American man?<br> I'll be your guide.<br> Ok.<br> Want this?<br> No, thank you.<br> It's not for sale.
