                        I beg your pardon. Was that your leg?<br> I had no idea we were going into a tunnel.<br> I thought the compartment was empty.<br> I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.<br> Awful man in the next compartment<br> smoking a vile cigar.<br> I had to come in here.<br> You don't smoke, do you?<br> - No, I don't.<br> - Thank heavens for that.<br> After last night, my head couldn't stand it.<br> You understand...<br> May I see your tickets, please?<br> Thank you, miss.<br> I'm afraid<br> you're in the wrong compartment, sir.<br> - It's a first-class compartment, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Then I'm all right.<br> - It's a third-class ticket.<br> What sort of line is this, selling<br> third-class tickets at first-class prices?<br> I am very sorry, sir.<br> That will be 5.04 extra.<br> - You haven't change for a fiver, have you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Don't bother, because I haven't got one.<br> This is the best I can do.<br> Do you suppose the line would settle for<br> 5 and tuppence ha'penny?<br> No, I don't suppose they would.<br> I hate to presume on our short<br> acquaintance, but have you any change?<br> I'm afraid that I...<br> There you are. That'll do. That stamp.<br> Thank you very much.<br> There you are, 5 and tuppence ha'penny<br> and three ha'pence. 5.04.<br> It's legal tender, old boy.<br> Write to your mother.<br> That man.<br> Mr. Aysgarth, may I?<br> Would you mind stepping forward<br> a little bit, Mrs. Fitzpatrick? Thank you.<br> Now, Mr. Aysgarth, please.<br> I wonder if I could have<br> a little bit more of your smile?<br> Not at this hour of the morning.<br> - There he is. Good morning, Johnnie.<br> - How are you?<br> - We've been looking for you everywhere.<br> - Everywhere.<br> Excuse me.<br> If it's possible at all, would you mind?<br> Of course. I'm so sorry.<br> See you later, Johnnie. Goodbye.<br> - Come, Alice. Come, Jessie.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Arert they bright this morning? Now.<br> That's very good.<br> Now could I have a little bit of a smile?<br> You remember.<br> I can hardly believe it.<br> It can't be the same girl.<br> What's her name? Do you know her?<br> Yes, but lay off, Johnnie.<br> You've enough on your hands for one day.<br> Besides, she's not up your alley.<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I'm a little bored with people in my alley.<br> - Introduce me to her, will you?<br> - Certainly not.<br> She's a very carefully brought up<br> young lady.<br> If you won't do it, I'll have to do it myself.<br> Come on, they're going.<br> - Lina, may we come in?<br> - I'm sorry. I didn't see you.<br> - How are you?<br> - Splendid.<br> May I introduce Mr. Aysgarth?<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> We were just passing by<br> and we saw you in the window.<br> - Johnnie insisted on meeting you.<br> - Why?<br> I'm told the sight of a really eligible male<br> is a rare treat in this part of the country.<br> - Isn't Johnnie terrible?<br> - He's too fantastic for words.<br> Arert you, Johnnie?<br> - Hadrt you better hurry?<br> - Hurry for what?<br> You don't want to be late for church.<br> - Did you all come to take me to church?<br> - No, but that is...<br> - lf you want to come...<br> - Naturally, we'd love to have you.<br> That's very kind of you. I think I will come.<br> Good. And put on that saucy little hat<br> you wore on the train the other day.<br> I will. Excuse me.<br> I'll be down in a moment.<br> We'd better sit down, girls.<br> - Where are you rushing to?<br> - To church, Mother.<br> - But I thought...<br> - I've changed my mind.<br> - Shall I go with you?<br> - I'm going with the Barhams.<br> - I thought you didn't like them.<br> - I loathe them.<br> Really, it's most extraordinary.<br> - You're not really going to church?<br> - I certainly am.<br> - No, you're coming for a walk with me.<br> - Don't be ridiculous.<br> Tell you what I'll do, I'll toss you for it.<br> Heads you do, tails you don't.<br> Mother.<br> Now what did you think<br> I was trying to do, kill you?<br> Nothing less than murder could justify<br> such violent self-defense.<br> - Look at you.<br> - Let me go.<br> I'm just beginning to understand.<br> You thought I was going to kiss you.<br> - Werert you?<br> - Of course not.<br> I was merely reaching around you,<br> trying to fix your hair.<br> - What's wrong with my hair?<br> - I'm glad you asked me that.<br> It would have been very discourteous<br> for me to bring the subject up.<br> - Are you serious?<br> - Of course I'm serious.<br> I may seem provincial, but frankly,<br> I can't understand men like you.<br> You always give me the feeling<br> that you're laughing at me.<br> No, I give you my word.<br> But your hair's all wrong.<br> It has such wonderful possibilities<br> that I got excited.<br> For the moment,<br> I became a passionate hairdresser.<br> - What's wrong with it?<br> - Let me show you.<br> Let me see...<br> - Don't do that.<br> - Why not?<br> Because your ucipital mapilary<br> is quite beautiful.<br> What's an ucipital mapilary?<br> - That.<br> - You don't need to touch it.<br> Let's see.<br> That's good.<br> I must be quite a novelty<br> by contrast with the women...<br> that you're photographed with.<br> What do you think of me<br> by contrast to your horse?<br> If I ever got the bit between your teeth,<br> I'd have no trouble in handling you at all.<br> Suppose just as you thought<br> you had me under control...<br> I turned around, neighed, and kissed you?<br> I think you've done enough fooling<br> with my hair.<br> You don't look very good like that.<br> You look more like a monkey<br> with a bit of mirror.<br> What does your family call you?<br> Monkeyface?<br> I still think my way was best.<br> I must go now or I'll be late to luncheon.<br> If my father saw me come in both late<br> and beautiful, he might have a stroke.<br> - Please don't bother to come any further.<br> - I'll be back for you at 3:00.<br> - No, really, I can't come out this afternoon.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> No, really,<br> I have to make calls with my mother.<br> - Liar.<br> - Really.<br> Don't forget, 3:00.<br> Lina will never marry.<br> She's not the marrying sort.<br> She has no need to worry.<br> There's enough to care for her<br> the rest of her life.<br> I suppose you're right, dear.<br> I'm afraid she's rather spinsterish.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> The old maid's a respectable institution.<br> All women are not alike. Lina has intellect<br> and a fine solid character.<br> Come on, I'm hungry.<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> Could I have some well-done,<br> please, Burton?<br> Yes, miss.<br> What kept you so long at church, dear?<br> I didn't go to church.<br> I went for a walk. Thank you, Burton.<br> - With a man.<br> - A man?<br> Yes. His name's John Aysgarth.<br> - John Aysgarth?<br> - Is that Tom Aysgarth's boy?<br> How'd you meet him?<br> Pity he's turned out so wild.<br> Rough luck on Tom.<br> What's this, horseradish?<br> Didrt know horseradish was in season.<br> - It's not out of a bottle, is it?<br> - Of course not, dear.<br> That's real.<br> I can tell the difference at once.<br> I can't stand things out of bottles.<br> They never taste the same.<br> Never, dear.<br> Why did you say<br> that John Aysgarth was wild, Father?<br> He was turned out of some club<br> for cheating at cards, wasrt he?<br> I don't know. I didn't ask him.<br> Or ought to have been.<br> Something unpleasant anyway.<br> - What's he doing down here?<br> - Staying at Penshaze.<br> Lord Middleham<br> wouldn't have him there...<br> if he had been turned out of a club<br> for cheating.<br> Maybe it wasrt cards. Maybe a woman.<br> He was corespondent or something,<br> I believe...<br> or ought to have been corespondent.<br> You can't expect me to remember<br> every detail about everybody.<br> Anyway, I'm going to see him again.<br> He's calling for me this afternoon at 3:00.<br> You're wanted on the telephone, miss.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Johnnie.<br> You can't?<br> Of course, I understand.<br> Thank you for calling.<br> I'd love to,<br> next time you come down again.<br> Hello?<br> Is Mr. John Aysgarth there, please?<br> He isn't?<br> I thought perhaps...<br> Are you expecting him for the Hunt Ball?<br> This is... It doesn't matter. I'll ring again.<br> - Nothing, Miss McLaidlaw.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Positive.<br> - I don't want to be a nuisance...<br> but couldn't it accidentally have been<br> put into somebody else's letter box?<br> I'm sorry, I'm sure it would have been<br> returned if that had happened.<br> Thank you.<br> Regent 0021, please.<br> No reply?<br> Thank you.<br> - Lina.<br> - Hello, Mother.<br> It's 7:00.<br> Arert you going to wear your new dress?<br> No, Mother. I'm not in the mood.<br> - What's the matter, dear?<br> - My head's splitting.<br> I'm not going to the ball.<br> Not going? You mean...<br> What'll your father say?<br> Perhaps some aspirin...<br> - You haven't a temperature, have you?<br> - I don't know.<br> Yes, come in.<br> - Where's your aspirin? I'll get it.<br> - In my bureau drawer.<br> - A telegram for you, miss.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Here's the aspirin, dear.<br> - What for?<br> - Your headache.<br> - That's gone.<br> - Tell Father I'll be down in a second.<br> - Really, I don't understand you.<br> I say, Lina.<br> - Yes, Reggie?<br> - What about our dance?<br> - Why, of course. Poor Reggie.<br> - Good.<br> I say, General, that's not Lina<br> dancing with Wetherby, is it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> - By Jove, I didn't recognize her at first.<br> I hardly knew her myself.<br> There's somebody at the door<br> for General McLaidlaw.<br> There's somebody to see you at the door.<br> This is General McLaidlaw.<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> There's a gentleman at the door<br> who says he's with your party.<br> He has no card, sir. The name is Aysgarth.<br> Aysgarth? Must be a mistake.<br> General McLaidlaw? I'm John Aysgarth.<br> I don't recall having invited you<br> in my party.<br> How awkward. I thought you had.<br> Otherwise I should never have come<br> all the way from London.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> I suggest you say something before<br> you embarrass this poor man to death.<br> - Hello, Johnnie.<br> - Hello, Lina.<br> - Hello, Johnnie.<br> - We were wondering if you were coming.<br> I'm sorry I'm late.<br> I believe this is our dance, isn't it?<br> - Hello, Monkeyface.<br> - Hello.<br> But we can't do this. Where are we going?<br> - Which is your car?<br> - This is ridiculous.<br> - Over there.<br> - Good. Come on.<br> Roll up the window before you catch cold.<br> Have you ever been kissed in a car before?<br> - Johnnie.<br> - Johnnie what?<br> You mustrt joke with me.<br> I'm no good at joking.<br> - I don't know how to flirt.<br> - I'm not joking. I'm serious.<br> - Have you ever been kissed in a car?<br> - Never.<br> Would you like to be?<br> Yes.<br> You're the first woman I've ever met<br> who said yes when she meant yes.<br> - What do the others say?<br> - Hanged if I know. Anything but yes.<br> - But they kiss you?<br> - Usually.<br> - Have there...<br> - Have there what, Monkeyface?<br> - Have there been many?<br> - I'm afraid so. Quite a few.<br> One night, when I couldn't fall asleep,<br> I started to count them.<br> The way you count sheep<br> jumping over a fence.<br> I think I passed out on number 73.<br> - Are you always frank with them like this?<br> - No, not particularly.<br> Why are you frank with me,<br> because I'm different?<br> No, it isn't that.<br> I'm honest because with you<br> I think it's the best way to get results.<br> I hope I'm not saying the wrong thing,<br> but I love you.<br> No, you haven't said<br> the wrong thing, Monkeyface.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - I don't know, anywhere.<br> I think I'm falling in love with you<br> and I don't quite like it.<br> That's why I stayed away from you<br> for a week.<br> I was afraid of you.<br> I didn't think it would happen like this.<br> Neither did I.<br> I saw an entirely different sort of person.<br> - So did I.<br> - I pictured it all rather conventionally.<br> We'd meet at a garden party,<br> he'd call on me in the evenings...<br> and we'd go for rides together,<br> and then afterward we'd...<br> We're coming to my house.<br> Would you like to stop for a drink?<br> No.<br> I'm going to get you back to that ball<br> as fast as possible.<br> Get out.<br> Why have you stopped?<br> I'm sure I don't know.<br> Come on.<br> - Good evening, Burton.<br> - I saw you coming up the drive, miss.<br> We won't be needing you.<br> We just stopped in for a drink.<br> - Very good.<br> - Shall we go in the study?<br> You sit down. I'll mix you a drink.<br> I think you need one.<br> You must be made of iron.<br> - Why?<br> - How can you be so calm?<br> Look at me. I'm shaking.<br> - The least you could do is swoon away.<br> - I know. I'm rather surprised myself.<br> I think it's because<br> for the first time in my life...<br> I know what I want.<br> Are you courting me?<br> I'm afraid I am.<br> This is a wonderful moment.<br> Here we are in my home,<br> the house that I was born in...<br> alone and together in my favorite room.<br> Do you like this room?<br> Very much.<br> Well, what are you doing here?<br> I say, old boy,<br> isn't that going a bit too far?<br> - He doesn't like me.<br> - I know.<br> He doesn't trust me from here to there.<br> Do you?<br> You're right. Stop it before it's too late.<br> Tell her everything you're thinking.<br> That I'm no good to her,<br> I can only bring her unappiness.<br> Warn her. Speak up, man.<br> It's your last chance.<br> Hear him?<br> Very distinctly.<br> He's not exaggerating a thing, dear.<br> It's all true, every word he isn't saying.<br> I love him, Father.<br> - Did you see him jump?<br> - I did.<br> Watch this one.<br> Sir, I have the honor of asking<br> for your daughter's hand in marriage.<br> What do you say to that?<br> You heard him that time, didn't you?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Poor Monkeyface.<br> Do you hear the music?<br> Very clearly.<br> Let's dance, before I... Before we...<br> Let's dance.<br> I was just going down to the post.<br> Could you stop at Marshall's<br> and get me more of this green wool?<br> Where'd I put it?<br> Here it is.<br> Be sure it's the same green.<br> Better take it out into the daylight.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> - Is there anything I can do for you?<br> - No, there's nothing I want.<br> Don't be late for tea, dear.<br> That trunk goes up on the landing.<br> How do you like it, Mrs. Aysgarth?<br> If you don't like it,<br> just blame it all on Mr. Bailey.<br> He rented it during our honeymoon.<br> He decorated the place.<br> - But if you do like it...<br> - I adore it. I'm mad about it. It's wonderful.<br> In that case,<br> you're talking to the right man.<br> - Because I engaged Mr. Bailey, didn't I?<br> - Yes, Mr. Aysgarth. That's true, I must say.<br> Johnnie, you're a genius.<br> Mr. Aysgarth,<br> I shall have to be getting along now.<br> What shall we do about the bill?<br> Will you drop it on that pretty little table<br> on your way out, old boy?<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> And may I wish you both<br> the very best of everything.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Bailey.<br> I never dreamt I would have<br> such a gorgeous place.<br> Are you sure you can afford it?<br> - I've forgotten your name.<br> - Ethel, sir.<br> - Well, Ethel, what about some tea?<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - What do you think of Ethel?<br> - She seems perfect.<br> - Are you sure...<br> - Let's go in the drawing room.<br> - Where are we?<br> - The Hunt Ball.<br> - Where else?<br> - Venice.<br> And?<br> And Naples, and Capri,<br> and Monte Carlo, and Nice.<br> - And?<br> - Paris.<br> Paris.<br> - I beg your pardon. A telegram for you, sir.<br> - Thank you, Ethel.<br> It isn't bad news, is it, dear?<br> An old friend of mine.<br> Stupid fellow, he wants 1,000.<br> - You couldn't spare 1,000, could you?<br> - What does he want it for?<br> Hanged if I know.<br> Probably because I borrowed it from him.<br> You borrowed it? Why?<br> I was going on a honeymoon<br> with the loveliest girl in the world...<br> and I wanted her to be happy.<br> Was she happy?<br> - Didrt you have any money of your own?<br> - Not a shilling.<br> But I thought... I had the impression...<br> Don't worry your darling little head<br> about it today of all days.<br> I'll take care of old Henry somehow.<br> I still don't understand.<br> Are you broke?<br> Monkeyface, I've been broke all my life.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Every time I brought the subject up, you...<br> Whatever made you<br> take this extravagant house?<br> I didn't think you'd want to live in a shack.<br> A girl like you is going to come into<br> plenty of money someday.<br> Wait a minute,<br> I can't quite get this into my head.<br> Were you thinking<br> of my ineritance when...<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Now, darling, really.<br> Isn't it silly to spend<br> the best years of our lives waiting?<br> Why not be comfortable now?<br> Johnnie...<br> I'm just beginning to understand you.<br> You're a baby.<br> I know you didn't marry me for my money.<br> You'd have done much better elsewhere.<br> But my income<br> will never pay for all this. Never.<br> What about your father?<br> I couldn't possibly ask my father.<br> Or even my mother.<br> You saw how restrained she was<br> when she met us at the station.<br> Anyway, you wouldn't actually<br> want to live on your wife's allowance?<br> - Of course not, darling.<br> - Well, then?<br> Answer me, Johnnie.<br> I suppose if the worst comes to the worst<br> and there's no other way out...<br> - I suppose I'll have to...<br> - What?<br> Borrow some more.<br> I haven't touched old Middleham yet.<br> He ought to be good<br> for a month or two's housekeeping.<br> I think you must be mad.<br> Marrying you is the sanest thing<br> I ever did in my life.<br> Come on, give it to me.<br> - That's too heavy for a little girl like you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Clear off the table.<br> Here, take that. Is there any cake?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Go along, get it.<br> Here, dear. Come on.<br> Thank you.<br> There's going to be no more borrowing.<br> - What else is there to do?<br> - You've got to go to work.<br> - Work?<br> - Yes, work.<br> You mean put on old clothes,<br> go out with a shovel?<br> Don't be flippant.<br> Then what do you mean?<br> I'm afraid you're a bit of a dreamer.<br> Let's be practical about this.<br> Do you know the statistics<br> on unemployment?<br> Do you realize in order to be a plumber,<br> or a carpenter, or an electrician...<br> Darling, you haven't been around.<br> They have to be apprentices first.<br> Even after that...<br> - Darling.<br> - There are all sorts of jobs.<br> I'm broad-minded.<br> Let's have some tea and then talk it over.<br> I could make out a list of jobs.<br> It might be fun.<br> I'll get a pencil and paper.<br> Excuse me, dear.<br> It's right there behind you.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Mother.<br> Yes, it's wonderful.<br> A most beautiful house.<br> Would you tell Father how badly I felt?<br> He is? Wait a minute till I tell Johnnie.<br> Father's sending us a wedding present.<br> Mother told him how happy I looked and...<br> I can't tell you how much<br> this means to me.<br> - Me, too.<br> - Yes. Father?<br> - Come on, ask him when he's sending it.<br> - It's coming right away, by messenger.<br> Invite them over for dinner.<br> Perhaps he'd like to play some golf.<br> Tell him that we were in the throes<br> of job-hunting when he telephoned.<br> - It doesn't hurt to impress the old boy.<br> - Really, you are the limit.<br> How can you be so gay about something...<br> that you should be ashamed of?<br> What, Father?<br> Yes, Johnnie and I were just having...<br> a sober and comprehensive discussion<br> of that very subject.<br> He has several ideas of the kind of job<br> he'd like to do...<br> and several good opportunities.<br> There's a messenger<br> from General McLaidlaw.<br> - Bring it in.<br> - It's just come, Father. Hold on, do.<br> I think I know what it is,<br> and if it is what I think it is...<br> Johnnie, you'll be thrilled.<br> It is! How wonderful.<br> We've had them in the family<br> before I was born.<br> Father's had lots of offers to sell them,<br> but he never would.<br> - How many more, for heavers sake?<br> - Just these two, sir.<br> He sent us both of them.<br> These are Father's<br> most precious possessions.<br> You don't say.<br> These will be our first heirlooms<br> to be handed down to our children...<br> - and then to their children.<br> - That's the thing to do with them, all right.<br> Father, you're so good to me<br> that you make me want to cry.<br> What was that?<br> Yes, you've made me very happy.<br> You've made Johnnie very happy, too.<br> Just a minute, he wants to say something.<br> Say something very nice.<br> These chairs really belong in a museum.<br> Hello, General.<br> Yes, but really, shouldn't you<br> have sent them to a museum?<br> Naturally we're thrilled. Who wouldn't be?<br> What, a job?<br> Yes, Lina and I were just going into that.<br> I have some excellent opportunities.<br> What are they?<br> I've just received a letter<br> from my cousin, Captain Melbeck.<br> Yes, he is a splendid chap.<br> He wants someone to manage his estate.<br> I thought I'd take the job.<br> I'm glad you approve.<br> Yes, we must. We'll get together soon.<br> I'll leave it up to Lina, shall I?<br> All right. Goodbye, sir.<br> That was a fib about Captain Melbeck,<br> wasrt it?<br> Was it?<br> - Did you have this letter all the time?<br> - I did.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Because, dear,<br> I never dreamed I'd be using it...<br> any more than I ever dreamed we'd be<br> receiving these two beautiful chairs.<br> Hello. It's a nice place<br> old Johnnie's got here.<br> It's an old Georgian house, isn't it?<br> I bet it cost him a packet to redecorate.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm Beaky Thwaite.<br> - You must be old Johnnie's wife.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> Didrt he ever tell you about me?<br> You're Beaky.<br> That's what they used to call me at school.<br> I happened to be driving by.<br> I thought I'd pop in for a cup of tea.<br> I've heard so much about you,<br> Mr. Thwaite.<br> Johnnie told me about you, too.<br> I ran into him at Newbury Races last week.<br> The races?<br> Put my foot in it as usual, have I?<br> Didrt he tell you?<br> Johnnie has a job.<br> He couldn't have been at the races.<br> Besides, he's given up betting.<br> He has, has he?<br> Don't you believe it, not Johnnie.<br> He's a great lad, he is.<br> You mustrt mind Johnnie cutting up.<br> That's what makes him Johnnie.<br> Besides, he thinks you're a topper,<br> he does.<br> - I think so, too.<br> - Wort you sit down?<br> I don't see why not. Something wrong?<br> Yes. There were two chairs here<br> this morning before I left.<br> Chairs? Disappeared, have they?<br> Yes, apparently.<br> - Were they expensive?<br> - Yes, they were museum pieces.<br> That Johnnie, he'll be the death of me.<br> Don't you understand?<br> - No, I don't.<br> - I bet you 20-to-1 that Johnnie sold them.<br> Sold them? What for?<br> For money, of course. A fellow's got to pay<br> his racing debts, hasn't he?<br> Johnnie dropped a packet of money<br> at Newbury, I can tell you that.<br> These bookies don't trust a chap for long.<br> Not a chap like Johnnie, that is.<br> I don't believe you.<br> I don't believe a word you're saying.<br> Put my foot in it again, have I?<br> My dear, you mustrt take it so seriously.<br> After all, it's Johnnie.<br> Wonderful chap, there's nobody like him.<br> But I needrt tell you that.<br> He couldn't have sold them.<br> He wouldn't, without asking me.<br> Here he comes.<br> Don't tell him I've said a word.<br> If you want to see Johnnie<br> at his very best...<br> just say something about chairs.<br> He doesn't need more than one second...<br> to invent the most howling lie<br> you ever heard.<br> I wouldn't have missed this<br> for anything in the world.<br> - Beaky.<br> - Johnnie, how are you?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I just popped in to see you.<br> I'm so glad to see you.<br> How's my little Monkeyface?<br> - What's the matter, darling?<br> - Nothing. Why?<br> You sure?<br> Your wife seems to be missing<br> some chairs, old boy.<br> Your pipe's not lit.<br> Let me get you a match.<br> Thanks, old bean.<br> - Here you are, catch.<br> - Thanks, old boy.<br> About those chairs, old bean?<br> The missing chairs, old man.<br> Yes, the chairs.<br> I imagine the American came<br> to get them this morning.<br> What American?<br> Didrt I tell you about him, darling?<br> How stupid of me.<br> He dropped by about a week ago.<br> A friend of Melbeck's.<br> I think you were out riding.<br> Go on, old man.<br> Anyway, he admired the chairs.<br> Extravagant fellow.<br> Offered 100 apiece for them.<br> Can you imagine? Anyone would take that.<br> I wouldn't.<br> Wouldrt you really, dear?<br> That never occurred to me.<br> As a matter of fact, I told him you would.<br> Why didn't you mention it?<br> I'm sorry, darling, but I thought I did.<br> That's all right.<br> If they're gone, they're gone.<br> They're gone, all right.<br> Shall we change for dinner?<br> You are an angel.<br> Hold on a minute.<br> You say he offered 100 apiece for them?<br> - That's right.<br> - Let's have a look at the check.<br> - He'll send it along.<br> - I bet you 10 to a shilling...<br> you wouldn't dare let your wife pick up<br> the telephone and ask Melbeck...<br> if he ever saw this American.<br> Are you implying<br> that my husband is a liar?<br> Don't mind Beaky, he's only joking.<br> I prefer jokes on other subjects.<br> Are you staying for dinner?<br> I'm spending the weekend<br> unless you throw me out.<br> Johnnie's friends are always welcome,<br> as long as they remain Johnnie's friends.<br> Hello, Isobel. Good afternoon.<br> - I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - Admiring your display?<br> It's nice.<br> You are our only local celebrity.<br> - Are you going my way?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - How's Johnnie?<br> - He's fine.<br> I just bought your latest for him.<br> He's an ardent admirer of yours.<br> I don't believe there's one of your stories<br> he hasn't read.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I just remembered something.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> I want to make some inquiries.<br> - Certainly.<br> - I'll see you for dinner soon.<br> - Delighted.<br> - I'll phone you, then. Goodbye.<br> Hello, old girl.<br> Mr. Thwaite, I owe you an apology.<br> Good. I mean, what for?<br> I'll explain to you later,<br> but I'm afraid I've done you an injustice.<br> An injustice? Thanks very much.<br> I forgive you from the bottom of my heart.<br> You seem a bit hot under the collar.<br> Not angry, are you? Don't answer. You are.<br> - Must be about old Johnnie.<br> - Would you excuse me? L...<br> You mustrt be angry with Johnnie.<br> It's a waste of time.<br> If you want to get sore with me,<br> that's different altogether.<br> I annoy everybody, always did.<br> But not Johnnie. You mustrt, really.<br> Would you mind, I want to speak<br> to Johnnie alone. Could you...<br> - You mean out in the garden?<br> - Please.<br> Hello. Don't move. Just stay like that.<br> I must watch the expressions<br> on your faces.<br> What've you got there, old bean?<br> You'll find out soon enough.<br> This is a red-letter day.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - What have we to drink in the house?<br> Gin, brandy, champagne and Pimm's No.1.<br> - Bring them all, and get a move on.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Stand aside.<br> Remember that necklace you admired<br> in the shop window in Regent Street?<br> It's yours.<br> And here... No, that's for Ethel.<br> Beaky, here's a little present for you.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's a secret.<br> - Stick.<br> - That's the finest that money can buy.<br> - Thanks, old bean.<br> - Hold those a moment, will you?<br> Darling, do you remember this?<br> I saw the hungry eye you gave it<br> last time we were up in London. It's yours.<br> Thank you, Beaky.<br> Here are some hats for you.<br> Never did like your hats<br> from the moment I ever saw you.<br> - Like the funny hat you wore on the train.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - What made you do all this?<br> - Now, dear, don't be angry.<br> If you don't like the hats,<br> you can always return them.<br> I got a present for myself. Do you mind?<br> I say, old girl, this is a nice stick. Strong.<br> - Dog?<br> - That's right.<br> - All dogs are fond of me.<br> - Go to Monkeyface.<br> But, Johnnie, you haven't told us<br> what this is all about.<br> - Yes, what's it mean?<br> - I have the pleasure of announcing...<br> the Goodwood Cup was run today<br> and I backed the winner.<br> A 10-to-1 shot, and I had 200 on it.<br> 200 at 10-to-1, that's 2,000.<br> - That's amazing.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - The way you worked that out so quickly.<br> - What?<br> - You know, the little sum.<br> - You're pulling my leg, old bean.<br> Darling, what's happened to your tongue?<br> - I suppose you disapprove of my betting.<br> - Not with 2,000 in her lap.<br> Come on, smile. I know I've been naughty,<br> but it's all for you.<br> - See that? That's Johnnie.<br> - Go on, darling, smile.<br> Where did you get the 200?<br> - That's not a very tactful question.<br> - Where did you get it?<br> You know very well there was no<br> American. I got it for the chairs, of course.<br> You sold the chairs<br> to gamble all your money on a horse.<br> Not exactly.<br> I owed the bookies some money.<br> It's an ancient story,<br> but you know how bookies are.<br> I got the 200 to pay them off.<br> But then, along came this hot tip and...<br> Darling, come on, give us a smile.<br> Come on, old girl. I know.<br> - You tickle her chin, and I'll make faces.<br> - Think that will work?<br> Come on, smile. Come on, dear.<br> - Do you see the glimmer of a smile?<br> - No, not a thing.<br> - Know any other tricks?<br> - Yeah.<br> I got something that never fails.<br> I make a noise like a duck.<br> No, that's not doing it.<br> - Shall I do this at the same time?<br> - Yeah, try that.<br> Come on, dear.<br> I forgot something. Darling, look.<br> It's a receipt from a certain shop<br> for a certain pair of chairs.<br> Paid in full,<br> and they deliver within the hour.<br> - Look, she's smiling.<br> - I dare say she is.<br> My darling.<br> Well done, old bean.<br> I say, look. Ethel's done her stuff.<br> What about celebrating?<br> You can always trust Beaky to say<br> the right thing at the right time.<br> Come on, old bean.<br> I could do with a pull at the beaker.<br> Ethel, a present for you. Turn around.<br> Mr. Aysgarth.<br> It's much too good for me.<br> You shouldn't have done that.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> What will my young man think?<br> - Don't forget the box.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Don't forget my hat.<br> - No, sir. Thank you, sir.<br> - This is yours, old girl.<br> - Thank you.<br> - This is yours, old bean.<br> - Thank you.<br> Now for a toast.<br> - What have you got there, brandy?<br> - Just this once.<br> - You know that's not good for you.<br> - All right, old man.<br> - Maybe just this once.<br> - All right, old bean.<br> I drink to the last bet<br> that will ever made by Johnnie Aysgarth.<br> Last bet, old bean.<br> - Get some water, quick.<br> - It won't help. I've seen it happen before.<br> There's nothing much you can do about it.<br> That's no use, darling.<br> It will either kill him<br> or it will go away by itself.<br> Sorry, old bean.<br> One of these days, it will kill him.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Aysgarth.<br> - How are you, Mrs. Newsham?<br> - What a lot of books.<br> - Do you really read them all, my dear?<br> - I'm afraid not. They're for Johnnie.<br> - Since when has he...<br> - Detective stories.<br> - Yes, he adores them.<br> So Johnnie's settled down<br> to the simple rural life.<br> - And it seems to agree with him.<br> - Abandoned all his vices, has he?<br> Vices? What vices, Mrs. Newsham?<br> Such as betting at the races, for instance.<br> He has no time for that.<br> He's much too busy with his job.<br> Is he? Then he must have taken<br> an afternoon off last Tuesday.<br> He was at the Merchester Races.<br> Was he? How interesting. Good afternoon.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Good afternoon, Mrs. Aysgarth.<br> - Good afternoon. Is Mr. Aysgarth in?<br> Why, no.<br> - When do you expect him?<br> - I really couldn't say.<br> Perhaps you'd like to talk<br> to Captain Melbeck.<br> Yes, I would very much, please.<br> Mrs. Aysgarth to see you.<br> Come in.<br> - What a pleasure to see you.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Do sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> I don't want to impose upon you...<br> but you're Johnnie's cousin<br> as well as his employer.<br> I wanted to talk to you about him.<br> I'm terribly worried.<br> Yes, I can understand that.<br> On the other hand, I told him<br> I wouldn't prosecute. Of course...<br> - I don't understand.<br> - I told him I wouldn't prosecute.<br> What on earth are you talking about?<br> How does he get away with it?<br> What reason did he give you<br> when I discharged him?<br> - When did you discharge him?<br> - Six weeks ago.<br> I haven't a very keen sense of humor.<br> If this is a joke, I wish you would tell me.<br> It's not funny to me.<br> We had an unexpected audit<br> six weeks ago.<br> The accounts showed a deficit of 2,000.<br> And when I looked into<br> Johnnie's records...<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> He should have told you.<br> It's perfectly all right.<br> And you say<br> you aren't going to prosecute?<br> Not for the time being.<br> I'll give him every possible opportunity<br> of replacing the money, but...<br> after all...<br> Yes, of course. Thank you very much.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Good afternoon, madam.<br> - Mr. Aysgarth home yet?<br> No, madam.<br> - Then you've heard.<br> - Yes, I've heard.<br> I'm so sorry, darling. I'm terribly sorry.<br> This telegram just came from the doctor.<br> It tells how it happened.<br> And to my dear sister, Emily Scudamore...<br> I bequeath an annuity of 1,000<br> for the duration of her lifetime.<br> To my niece, Miss Elsie Chilling,<br> the sum of 5,000.<br> To my two dear cousins,<br> Robert and Jane Atwood, 500 each.<br> The residue of my estate, my house,<br> and all the property contained therein...<br> I leave to my beloved wife, Martha...<br> with the wish that she continue<br> the present allowance of 500 a year...<br> to my daughter, Lina.<br> Also, to my daughter Lina<br> and her husband John Aysgarth...<br> I bequeath the portrait of myself...<br> painted by the distinguished<br> Sir Joshua Nettlewood.<br> - I could do with a drink.<br> - I'll get you one.<br> Don't bother, I'll get it myself.<br> In the study, isn't it?<br> You win, old boy.<br> Yes, dear?<br> Do you ever have any regrets<br> that you married me?<br> Why do you ask that?<br> It seems pretty obvious...<br> that your father would've left you<br> more than his portrait...<br> if you'd been anybody else<br> but Mrs. John Aysgarth.<br> So that's what you meant.<br> You haven't answered my question.<br> What about you? Have you any regrets?<br> Monkeyface, marrying you is the one thing<br> I've never changed my mind about.<br> - Do you really mean that?<br> - Yes, I really mean that.<br> I want nothing<br> but to spend the rest of my life with you.<br> And if you were to die first, I...<br> If I were to die first?<br> Listen, what about you?<br> I couldn't stop loving you if I tried.<br> Have you tried?<br> Yes. Once.<br> When?<br> When I found out you'd lost your job<br> with Captain Melbeck.<br> - How long have you known?<br> - Since last Friday.<br> - Who told you?<br> - Captain Melbeck. I met him.<br> - Did he tell you why?<br> - No.<br> Suppose you tell me why.<br> We just didn't get along.<br> Quite nice here.<br> Shall we stop and look at the sea?<br> Why didn't you get along with him?<br> I don't know. He's a bit of an old fogy.<br> I suppose my ideas<br> were too daring for him.<br> I've always had the notion that<br> the secret of success is to start at the top.<br> You think I'm talking through my hat,<br> don't you? I'm not.<br> The way to make money<br> is to think in a big way.<br> Look at this all land, for instance.<br> Look at the view.<br> Why isn't something done about it?<br> If I had 10,000, or better still, 20,000...<br> I could start a development here.<br> All you need is 20,000?<br> Or 30,000.<br> An extra 10,000 wouldn't hurt a bit.<br> Beaky, this is the ground plan.<br> Wonderful. We could put<br> the large hotel there.<br> That's the idea. And down here,<br> we could build the beach huts.<br> - Beechnuts, old bean?<br> - Huts, Beaky.<br> - Hello. What goes on here, anyway?<br> - We're organizing a real estate company.<br> We're about to buy<br> a very beautiful piece of land by the sea.<br> What a view, what sun, what air.<br> Then we're going to sell part of it<br> at a profit.<br> - Yes, but it will need financing, won't it?<br> - Of course.<br> You found somebody<br> to put up the money?<br> Of course.<br> - Who?<br> - Me.<br> I see.<br> The idea is mine,<br> but the money is Beaky's.<br> And the corporation, Beaky borrows<br> against those securities he has in Paris.<br> Then we issue stock, and...<br> Let me show you, dear.<br> The company's going to be in my name.<br> - Yes, but...<br> - Look, darling...<br> let me show you how simple it is.<br> - Does Beaky understand it?<br> - Perfectly.<br> I think.<br> I beg your pardon, sir. Captain Melbeck<br> would like to talk to you on the telephone.<br> Thank you. I'll take it in the study.<br> - Excuse me, Beaky.<br> - All right, old bean.<br> Please explain it to me, will you?<br> You see, my dear girl...<br> I say, I rather like this feeling<br> of big business and all that sort of thing.<br> George, I keep telling you<br> not to worry about it.<br> I've got something on now.<br> I can pay you back in a couple of weeks.<br> We buy up this land<br> and then we sell part of it.<br> That gives us a 100% profit in no time.<br> On the other part,<br> we build something or other.<br> But from whom do you buy the land?<br> How much do you pay for it?<br> - To whom do you sell it?<br> - That shouldn't be difficult.<br> Isn't it about time you grew up?<br> - You're scolding me.<br> - You need a scolding.<br> - Do I?<br> - Yes, you do.<br> Shall I go and stand in the corner?<br> - You're not being fair to Johnnie.<br> - That's a bit thick.<br> Why, he's president<br> of the whole bally thingamajig.<br> - Gets a salary, writes his own checks.<br> - Yes, that's what I mean.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> Old bean, Lina's been telling me<br> you're a bit soft in the head. Is that it?<br> - It sounded like that.<br> - Come now, that's not very wifely.<br> Hadrt you better change for dinner?<br> It's getting late.<br> Darling, Beaky's staying with us<br> for a few days.<br> - You know your room.<br> - I shart be a jiffy.<br> Look here. What right have you<br> to interfere in my affairs?<br> I wasrt really. I was only...<br> You were only what?<br> I was only trying to tell Beaky<br> that he shouldn't leave everything to you...<br> because if something went wrong,<br> he should take a little responsibility, too.<br> It's not as if you're both<br> experienced businessmen.<br> - What do you know about business?<br> - Very little. I was only...<br> Suppose Beaky had taken you seriously?<br> You'd have ruined the whole scheme,<br> you realize that?<br> - But if it werert any good...<br> - That's my business, not yours.<br> If I say it's good, it's good.<br> I'm going through with this deal.<br> I don't want any interference<br> from you or anyone else.<br> - Is that clear?<br> - Yes, that's clear.<br> Hello, Monkeyface.<br> You frightened me.<br> I didn't see you coming.<br> I thought you might like to know<br> I'm calling off the real estate plan.<br> Why? What happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Does Beaky know about this?<br> - No, not yet.<br> - Why are you doing it?<br> I don't know. Perhaps the land<br> isn't any good. Who knows?<br> Or perhaps I don't like the idea<br> of risking Beaky's money.<br> Or perhaps it's a stiff job and I'm too lazy.<br> - Are you still angry about last night?<br> - No, I'm not angry.<br> Are you sure?<br> Because I couldn't sleep all night.<br> You'd never spoken so sharply<br> to me before, and I was afraid...<br> Afraid of what?<br> I was afraid you'd stopped loving me.<br> No, Monkeyface, I'm not angry.<br> And I love you very much.<br> Every time I play anagrams,<br> I can only make three-letter words.<br> D-O-U-B. There's no such word.<br> D-O-U-B-T. "Doubt." F-U-L. "Doubtful."<br> Take that, old girl.<br> Personally, I don't see<br> what's wrong with this scheme.<br> But if you say there's no good<br> going ahead, don't let's go ahead.<br> Do I get another turn?<br> I still don't understand why we have to go<br> all the way out there to look at it.<br> I won't be responsible<br> for calling the scheme off...<br> - without first proving to you it's no good.<br> - Lf you say it's no good, that satisfies me.<br> After all, you discovered the land.<br> It was your idea.<br> If a fellow has an idea,<br> he jolly well ought to follow it up.<br> You have to go up there<br> early tomorrow morning and take a look.<br> Why are you so insistent?<br> Because, as I told you,<br> I won't be responsible.<br> That's a long one. "Mudder."<br> There's no such word.<br> Try the "R."<br> I don't want to go up there in the morning.<br> Besides, it'll be nasty, and cold, and wet.<br> - Now, Beaky.<br> - What time do we have to start?<br> If I had an "e" and an "r"<br> I could make that murderer.<br> The earlier the better.<br> I'd say about 7:00.<br> There won't be so much traffic then.<br> - 7:00? That's a bit pig's tail.<br> - Pig's tail?<br> Too early.<br> Did you never hear that one, pig's tail?<br> Is Mr. Aysgarth having breakfast?<br> No, ma'am, he wouldn't wait.<br> He said he'd have some on the road.<br> He left two hours ago with Mr. Thwaite.<br> - What car did they use?<br> - Mr. Thwaite's, I believe.<br> This ought to do it. Put in the plug now.<br> How's that, old bean?<br> - Hello, old girl.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> What's all this?<br> I've only been away a few hours.<br> - It seemed like a thousand years.<br> - Seems like that to me, too.<br> Shut up, Beaky. It was nothing.<br> Nothing? I came very close<br> to losing my life. You call that nothing?<br> - You nearly lost your life?<br> - Came very close to it.<br> - Let's drop the subject.<br> - No, Beaky, go on. I want to hear.<br> There we were at the top of the cliff.<br> I agreed that Johnnie was right.<br> There was too much chalk in the soil.<br> I was trying to turn my car near the edge<br> of the cliff. I never was handy with a car.<br> - Was Johnnie in the car?<br> - No.<br> He was a few feet away<br> looking over at the view.<br> It's hardly won'th talking about.<br> Let's all have a drink.<br> I didn't realize I was backing the car<br> towards the edge.<br> But I was, by Jove. Right up to it.<br> If Johnnie hadrt taken a flying leap<br> and grabbed the brake...<br> I should be in kingdom come by now.<br> - Johnnie saved your life?<br> - He certainly did.<br> Came jolly close to losing his own, too.<br> I can never tell you<br> how much this means to me.<br> - To you, darling?<br> - It means a good bit to me, too.<br> The old fellow deserves a reward.<br> How about a night out?<br> A spot of celebrating on me.<br> That's kind of you,<br> but don't you have to go to Paris?<br> - Paris?<br> - Yes. My securities are over there.<br> I've got to go over there<br> and cancel all the arrangements for them.<br> Why don't you come over with me?<br> The cad seems to forget<br> I'm a married man.<br> I'll tell you what I might do.<br> I might drive up as far as London with you<br> for that evening out.<br> - How about that, Monkeyface?<br> - Yes, Monkey... Lina. Do let him come.<br> It seems to me that...<br> Yes, I know. It seems to you<br> I should be looking for a job.<br> It seems to me I'd have much more chance<br> of getting a job in London.<br> Yes, of course he would.<br> Do let him come, Lina.<br> I don't see very well how I can stop him.<br> Great.<br> Pity that he won't come to Paris with me.<br> Did I ever tell you what happened to me<br> last time I was in Paris?<br> A very curious instance.<br> I was walking down the Champs lyses...<br> and I met the most charming girl.<br> Took her out and gave her a spot<br> of dinner. And it wasrt till much later...<br> Sorry, old bean. Sorry, old girl.<br> Nearly put the foot in it again, have I?<br> There's an Inspector Hodgson<br> in the hall, ma'am.<br> He wanted to see Mr. Aysgarth.<br> But when I said he was away,<br> he asked if he might speak to you.<br> Show him to the study,<br> will you, Ethel, please.<br> Very good, madam.<br> - Will you come this way, please, sir?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Mrs. Aysgarth?<br> - Yes.<br> My name's Hodgson. Inspector Hodgson.<br> We're from the county police.<br> This is my colleague. Mr. Benson.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Benson?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Wort you sit down?<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> I understand your husband's not in.<br> No. He's been up in London for two days.<br> As he's not here,<br> I thought you might be able to help us.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Wort you have some tea or something?<br> No, thank you. We've had ours.<br> I believe you know a Mr. Thwaite.<br> Yes, he's a close friend of my husband.<br> I don't know how to put it, quite.<br> Perhaps it would be easier<br> if I showed you this.<br> This afternoors paper.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm sorry. This is a shock.<br> We knew him so very well.<br> Sorry to have to do this, ma'am...<br> but we're making inquiries<br> on behalf of the Paris police.<br> They found papers<br> on Mr. Thwaite's person...<br> which indicated he'd just formed<br> a corporation with your husband.<br> What do the French police believe<br> caused the death?<br> This is the copy of a telegram<br> we received from Paris.<br> "Thwaite visited the place<br> in the company of another Englishman.<br> "Both men had evidently been drinking.<br> "On arrival, Thwaite ordered<br> a bottle of brandy.<br> "According to the statement<br> of one of the waiters there...<br> "Thwaite's companion asked for<br> the brandy to be served in large beakers.<br> "Apparently, as a result of a bet<br> between the two men...<br> "Thwaite filled one of these beakers<br> to the brim and drank it all.<br> "The other man was not present<br> when the actual tragedy happened...<br> "having left the place<br> a few minutes before.<br> "French police have not yet succeeded<br> in establishing his identity.<br> "According to the waiter, who has<br> a slight understanding of English...<br> "his name would appear to be<br> 'Awlbeam' or 'Holebeam."'<br> I'm sorry to upset you, ma'am.<br> But do you or your husband<br> know of any friend of Mr. Thwaite's...<br> who would answer to such a name?<br> Perhaps Mrs. Aysgarth could enlighten us<br> about this corporation.<br> Yes, I believe I can.<br> My husband had planned<br> a real estate development with him.<br> Mr. Thwaite had gone to Paris<br> to dissolve the corporation.<br> He apparently died before he could do this.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Any further questions, Benson?<br> None that I can think of.<br> - Thank you very much, Mrs. Aysgarth.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> When does Mr. Aysgarth<br> return from London?<br> I expect him this evening.<br> Would you ask him<br> to ring me at the station?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Goodbye, Inspector Hodgson.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Benson.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Aysgarth.<br> He didn't go to Paris.<br> He didn't go to Paris, I tell you.<br> Hogarth Club.<br> May I speak to Mr. Aysgarth, please?<br> When do you expect him?<br> He left yesterday morning?<br> No. It doesn't matter. Thank you.<br> Hello, Monkeyface.<br> You've read about Beaky, have you?<br> I was terribly fond of Beaky.<br> - Were you?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> I loved that silly, generous,<br> good-hearted fool.<br> - Did you?<br> - Of course I did.<br> Next to you, I loved him<br> more than anybody in the world.<br> Next to me?<br> Poor Monkeyface.<br> Here I am thinking only of myself<br> and forgetting all about you.<br> You liked him, too, didn't you?<br> I liked him very much.<br> The police were here.<br> What did they want?<br> They wanted you to help them.<br> They had a telegram from Paris...<br> and it seems there was<br> an Englishman who made a bet...<br> Yes, I know.<br> The whole story was in the late edition.<br> What else?<br> The inspector wants you to phone him.<br> He thought perhaps you could<br> help identify this Englishman.<br> What did you tell them?<br> Did you mention the corporation?<br> Naturally.<br> I told them that Beaky<br> was planning to dissolve it.<br> I wish you'd left all that to me.<br> What else did you tell them?<br> That's about all.<br> I said I was expecting you<br> back from London at any moment.<br> Hello. Wickstead police station, please.<br> Hello, Inspector.<br> This is John Aysgarth. I've just got home.<br> Yes.<br> I drove up to London with him<br> on Tuesday evening.<br> We dined at the Savoy.<br> No.<br> Yes.<br> Then I saw him off at Croyden Airport.<br> Yes.<br> No. I stayed in London until this afternoon.<br> At my club.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Not at all, Inspector.<br> If I can help you in any other way,<br> be sure to let me know.<br> Isobel, may I come in?<br> Lina, how nice.<br> I was thinking only yesterday...<br> that I don't see half as much of you<br> as I'd like.<br> How sweet of you.<br> I couldn't put my light out<br> until 3:00 this morning.<br> I was so interested in your last book that I<br> had to come over and talk to you about it.<br> That's the most thrilling compliment<br> I ever got. Come and sit down.<br> - Had your tea?<br> - Yes, I have. Thank you.<br> I never knew you were<br> such a murder story fan.<br> Neither did I until recently.<br> - Did you really like it?<br> - I couldn't put it down.<br> I was completely fascinated<br> by the way your villain...<br> My villain? My hero, you mean.<br> I always think of my murderers<br> as my heroes.<br> I didn't mean to interrupt. You were<br> saying you were completely fascinated.<br> When he enticed his victim<br> across the footbridge...<br> knowing that the bridge<br> had been sawn through...<br> He also knew that his victim<br> couldn't swim. Don't forget that.<br> What I want to know is this.<br> Would you call that an actual murder?<br> From a moral standpoint,<br> there's no question at all.<br> It is murder.<br> I suppose it is.<br> What does Johnnie think?<br> Johnnie?<br> I haven't discussed it with him yet.<br> I should think he'd be interested.<br> The same situation<br> with this friend of his in Paris.<br> The same?<br> That brandy business<br> is just like my footbridge.<br> If they get his companion,<br> the question would be:<br> Was it murder or an accident?<br> The brandy thing isn't new at all,<br> you know.<br> - It's been done before?<br> - Yes, and in real life, too.<br> I have it here.<br> Richard Palmer got rid of<br> one of his victims that way.<br> A man called Abbey.<br> Was he hanged?<br> Trial of Richard Palmer. Where can it be?<br> They got him eventually,<br> after he killed half a dozen other people.<br> The fool got bored with the brandy<br> method and went on with real poison.<br> - He was a fool, wasrt he?<br> - Maybe I put it under the "T's."<br> If he'd stuck to brandy, he might have...<br> That's an interesting idea.<br> Suppose I ask my brother about it.<br> He's the Home Office Analyst. Conducts<br> post-mortems and all that sort of things.<br> I get some of my neatest ideas from him.<br> It really doesn't matter, Isobel.<br> Please don't bother. It's not important.<br> I'll run along. I don't want to trouble you.<br> - Now I remember. It's in your own house.<br> - What is?<br> The Trial of Richard Palmer.<br> That book about the brandy.<br> Johnnie borrowed it<br> a couple of weeks ago.<br> - Goodbye, Isobel.<br> - Goodbye, my dear.<br> Hello?<br> No, he isn't in.<br> This is Mrs. Aysgarth speaking.<br> This is<br> the Guarantors Assurance Company.<br> Would you tell Mr. Aysgarth that there's<br> been a delay in replying to his inquiry?<br> We have written him fully on the matter.<br> He should get our letter in the morning.<br> Yes, I will. Thank you.<br> - Good morning, madam.<br> - Good morning. Are there any letters?<br> Just three for Mr. Aysgarth<br> and a magazine for you, ma'am.<br> Hello, Ethel. You here again?<br> Yes, sir. I've brought<br> your morning tea and the post.<br> - Hello, darling. Any letters for me?<br> - Three.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> - Well, well, well.<br> - Good news?<br> Got a letter from old Spotty.<br> He's going to India.<br> What a life.<br> Says he wishes he had time<br> to pop down and see us.<br> That'd be a dream. Poor old Spotty.<br> - Do you mind if I take my bath before you?<br> - No, dear.<br> May I have some more soap,<br> Monkeyface? This bit's nearly gone.<br> Yes, there's some in the cupboard<br> above the washbasin.<br> - Darling, you're not shivering, are you?<br> - I've a bit of a chill.<br> Cold in all this sunshine?<br> Let me warm you up.<br> My poor little shivering baby.<br> How do you feel now? Better?<br> - Much.<br> - Good. Perhaps this will help.<br> - Darling, what are we doing tonight?<br> - We're going to Isobel's to dine.<br> What a bore.<br> Issie, let's get back<br> to that new book of yours.<br> The fellow comes into the room, locks it,<br> and starts to strum on the piano...<br> then somebody shoots him<br> through the locked door? That the idea?<br> That doesn't make sense. Why would he<br> lock the door just to play the piano?<br> Was he ashamed of his playing?<br> I arranged it this way.<br> A certain note on the piano was wired to<br> a revolver concealed in the wall paneling.<br> When the victim struck this note...<br> There you are.<br> I don't care much for that.<br> You're slipping, old girl.<br> - What's wrong with it, my dear chap?<br> - That's too complicated.<br> If you're going to kill somebody,<br> do it simply.<br> Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk?<br> You're right.<br> Just as long as you don't get caught.<br> - Do the wine, will you?<br> - Yes, Issie.<br> How would you do it simply?<br> I don't know, dear.<br> I'd use the most obvious method.<br> The most important thing<br> is that no one should suspect me.<br> - For instance?<br> - For instance, poison.<br> Just use the first one<br> that came to my mind. Say, arsenic.<br> Arsenic.<br> I remember...<br> in Gloucester, where<br> we exhumed the body four years after...<br> there was still enough poison,<br> even in the fingernails and the hair.<br> Yes, but did you get the murderer?<br> Let me see.<br> No, I don't think we did.<br> There you are.<br> Think of it. This very minute,<br> there are hundreds of people...<br> who have committed murder<br> and they're walking about freely.<br> Thousands.<br> Do you suppose<br> those murderers are happy, Johnnie?<br> I don't know, dear.<br> I don't see why they shouldn't be.<br> Fear of discovery, my lad.<br> So long as arsenic leaves traces and<br> a bullet's marked by the barrel of a gun...<br> and the tiniest hair of your head<br> can be identified...<br> It seems to me by now someone would've<br> discovered a poison that can't be traced.<br> What about it, Doctor?<br> A very interesting corpse<br> dropped in the other day.<br> - Do let's hear about it.<br> - No, please. Don't change the subject.<br> I saw that look that passed between you.<br> There's an untraceable poison, isn't there?<br> Nonsense. No such thing.<br> I'll bet you know, Doctor. What is it?<br> Not in a million years.<br> Now, come.<br> After all, do I look like a murderer?<br> That's an interesting question.<br> What do you think, Issie?<br> Issie can tell by looking at a persors face<br> whether he or she is capable of murder.<br> Can't you, Issie?<br> I don't want to sound conceited,<br> but I usually can.<br> What about me, dear?<br> Could I murder anyone?<br> You couldn't hurt a fly, Bertram.<br> Unless it was already dead.<br> What about Mrs. Aysgarth?<br> She has a strange glint in her eye.<br> I'm afraid not. Lina hasn't the nerve<br> any more than I have.<br> As for you, you silly thing.<br> Look at the expression on his face.<br> Trying to look mysterious, are you?<br> You can't fool me.<br> You couldn't commit a murder<br> if you tried for 100 years.<br> No, I don't believe I could.<br> Johnnie, you're locking up.<br> What about Ethel?<br> It's Ethel's day off.<br> She won't be back until morning.<br> What about Cook?<br> What's the matter, dear?<br> Have you forgotten?<br> Cook's away on a holiday.<br> Darling, you're shivering again.<br> Do you suppose you're catching cold?<br> Yes. I think that's what it must be.<br> We have to tuck you into bed.<br> Get you nice and warm.<br> - Take off your coat.<br> - No, Johnnie. Please don't.<br> This reminds me of the day we first met<br> on the top of the hill...<br> when you wouldn't let me unbutton<br> the top button of your blouse.<br> Do you remember?<br> I shall never forget it.<br> Get undressed, old girl.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> Johnnie, I'm in a state tonight.<br> I don't know why. I'd like to be alone.<br> Would you mind sleeping<br> in your dressing room?<br> Of course I'd mind.<br> Please, Johnnie.<br> I haven't been sleeping very well lately.<br> I understand.<br> You used to sleep badly<br> when I wasrt here, and now you...<br> All right, if that's how you feel about it.<br> Good night.<br> Feeling better?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> - Hello, Isobel.<br> - How are you, my dear?<br> All right.<br> I've been asleep all day, haven't I?<br> Isobel's brother gave you<br> a sleeping pill this morning.<br> Your nerves seemed to be all upset.<br> We were quite worried about you.<br> Cheer up. Bertram had a good look at you.<br> Although he doesn't usually attend<br> living people, he's a very able doctor.<br> He says all you needed was a little sleep.<br> I'll run down and tell Ethel<br> to fix something for your supper.<br> He's one in a million,<br> that Johnnie of yours.<br> Isn't he?<br> Do you mind if I smoke?<br> Have you been here all afternoon?<br> Naturally. Ever since Johnnie phoned.<br> I warn you. You'd better get well.<br> If you leave me alone much longer<br> with this husband of yours...<br> my career will soon be over.<br> - He flirted with you, I suppose.<br> - Flirted? Worse than that.<br> He's worming all my secrets out of me.<br> I suspect him of writing<br> a detective story on the side.<br> What secrets?<br> He's always pestering me.<br> I always swear I won't tell him<br> and I always do.<br> Did you tell him anything today?<br> Did I? Bertram was furious.<br> Said he'd never confide in me again.<br> But honestly, have you ever been able<br> to deny Johnnie anything?<br> Never.<br> It was about that poison, wasrt it?<br> Don't remind me of it. I'm ashamed,<br> and mortified, and disgraced.<br> I'm just a fool, that's all. If he writes<br> a story on that one before I do...<br> I suppose I'll deserve it.<br> Imagine. A substance<br> in daily use everywhere.<br> Anyone can lay his hands on it.<br> And within a minute after taking,<br> the victim's beautifully out of the way.<br> Mind you, it's undetectable after death.<br> Is whatever it is painful?<br> Not in the least.<br> In fact, I should think<br> it would be a most pleasant death.<br> Good night, Lina.<br> You're still annoyed with me, aren't you?<br> No, Johnnie, really. I still don't feel well.<br> A few days at your mother's house<br> will do more good than staying at home.<br> It's not exactly that. Don't you<br> understand? Mother telephoned me and...<br> She got on that telephone<br> awfully early, it seems to me.<br> Mother gets up early,<br> and she's lonely down there.<br> I happened to mention I was a bit nervy...<br> and before I knew it I'd agreed<br> to spend a few days with her.<br> All right.<br> I'll run down and get the car ready.<br> - No. I'll drive myself.<br> - I prefer to drive you.<br> I think I'll take the short cut.<br> Johnnie!<br> Johnnie!<br> Lina, what's got into you?<br> Lina! Stop it, you little fool!<br> I've had enough! How much do you think<br> a man can bear? Listen to me!<br> You throw me out of your room,<br> run off to your mother's...<br> now you shrink away from me<br> as though you hated me. You're my wife.<br> You almost killed us both back there.<br> You pulled away when I was reaching over<br> to save you from falling out of the car.<br> You don't have to<br> put up with me anymore.<br> Johnnie, where are you going?<br> - First, I'm taking you to your mother's.<br> - And then what?<br> Don't worry. I won't bother you again.<br> Johnnie, you mean you're going to...<br> Why were you asking Isobel<br> those questions about the poison?<br> What were you planning to do with it?<br> Johnnie, you were going to kill yourself.<br> My darling.<br> Yes, but I saw that was a cheap way out.<br> I'm going to see it through,<br> prison term and everything.<br> Prison? You mean Melbeck,<br> that money you took?<br> I can't pay it back.<br> I made the last attempt to raise the money<br> when I went away with Beaky.<br> - Paris?<br> - I went to Liverpool.<br> I tried to borrow on your insurance,<br> but it didn't work.<br> You were in Liverpool when Beaky...<br> Then you didn't go to Paris.<br> Of course not.<br> You think I'd have let some idiot<br> give poor old Beaky that brandy if I had?<br> Johnnie, if I'd only known.<br> This is as much my fault as yours.<br> I was only thinking of myself,<br> not what you were going through.<br> If I'd been really close to you,<br> you could've confided in me...<br> but you were afraid to.<br> You were ashamed to come to me.<br> If I'd only understood.<br> But it will be different now.<br> We'll make it different.<br> People don't change overnight, Lina.<br> I'm no good.<br> Let's turn back. Let's go home<br> and see it all through together.<br> No. It won't work.<br> I'm driving you on to your mother's.<br> It will work. I know it will, Johnnie, please.<br> This isn't your problem, Lina.<br> But it is. You can't shut me out.<br> Turn the car around and let's go home.<br> Please, Johnnie.<br> No, Lina.<br> My darling.<br> English<br>
