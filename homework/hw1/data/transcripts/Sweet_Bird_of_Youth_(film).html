Please.<br> She can't. I'll call you back.<br> Downstairs, in the cocktail lounge.<br> I'll wait.<br> - You shouldn't have done that, Tom Jr.<br> - Aunt Nonnie, you're a silly old maid.<br> And if he calls back, you just hang up.<br> I mean it, Aunt Nonnie. Just hang up.<br> Finley residence.<br> No, Mr. Chance.<br> She still ain't available.<br> We present this controversial<br> newsreel as a public service.<br> In 1930, Tom Finley ran<br> for his first state office.<br> You all know me. I'm just a<br> plain old dirt farmer, like you folks.<br> And Tom Finley was elected.<br> Tom Finley ran for governor.<br> I'm against loose government...<br> ... loose money and loose women!<br> And Tom Finley was elected.<br> Tom Finley built a political machine<br> and became Boss Finley.<br> He also built a<br> plain old dirt farmer's shack...<br> ... worth $300,000.<br> He sails from his private beach<br> in his private speedboat.<br> Boss Finley gave away<br> the offshore oil of his state.<br> The oil man made Finley a partner...<br> ... and Boss Finley made his<br> oil partner the governor...<br> ... and kept him in office<br> all these years.<br> Four months ago,<br> Professor Burtus Haven Smith...<br> ... ran against Finley's handpicked man.<br> The only thing you have<br> to fear is Finley himself.<br> Next day, Professor Smith, fired.<br> His home was invaded by hoodlums...<br> ... books and paintings<br> burned on the lawn.<br> Did you recognize any of them, sir?<br> No. They wore masks like this.<br> I found this button.<br> Yes, sir. I'm president of the<br> Finley Youth Club, and I'm proud of it.<br> But I don 't know nothing about<br> no book burnings or...<br> This thing, it could be dropped<br> accidentally on purpose...<br> ...you know what I mean?<br> - But to date, there has been no probe...<br> ... no police action, no arrests.<br> - Why?<br> - Shut that contraption off.<br> These are the fruits<br> of Boss Finley's rise to power...<br> How can a Christian TV network<br> tolerate those filthy, black lies?<br> - Right here, in the heart of America.<br> - Why, they ought to be...<br> Thank you, honey.<br> - Horsewhipped and shot.<br> And if I wasn't mayor and against<br> violence, I'd do it myself.<br> Well, if that TV report lied,<br> why not sue them for libel?<br> If they lied?<br> You know, you surprise me, Ben.<br> For a man who's smart enough<br> to run a big daily newspaper...<br> ...you sure surprise me.<br> Can't you recognize New York...<br> ...Red propaganda when you see it?<br> Do you call that TV newsreel fair?<br> Now, Maribelle,<br> we're all on the same side.<br> - Are we, Ben?<br> - Fair, you mean?<br> Well, your father's going<br> on the same network.<br> Same time, same freedom of expression.<br> I'd say that was pretty fair.<br> A lot fairer than burning books and...<br> You accusing me, Ben?<br> Why, Tom Jr. Hasn't got<br> a mean bone in his body.<br> He might be a hot-blooded<br> buck like his daddy...<br> - Now, Mrs. Norris.<br> ...but he'd never resort to violence.<br> Never. And you have my personal<br> guarantee that whoever did do it...<br> ...justice will prevail.<br> - Right, sheriff?<br> - Certainly.<br> What in tarnation are you laughing at?<br> Nothing, Pa. Nothing at all.<br> Then shut up!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Only idiots laugh at nothing.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - When I was called from...<br> ...the clay hills where I was born...<br> ...barefoot and hungry, called by<br> the voice of God, which I was...<br> Will somebody pick up<br> that damn phone!<br> I ain't never forgot<br> what I was called for.<br> I didn't build a land<br> of milk and honey to see...<br> - Where you going?<br> - Get something for that cough.<br> Sit down! I've hawked<br> and spit all my life...<br> ...and I'll hawk and spit<br> till the end of my days.<br> You can bet on that.<br> When I answer those charges<br> on TV tomorrow night...<br> ...I expect you to be there.<br> - Why, you know me, Tom.<br> I expect you and your<br> Daughters of Dixie to be there.<br> God bless you, honey.<br> And I expect you to be there too.<br> I'll be there, Mr. Finley.<br> At the press table.<br> You'll be on the platform,<br> at my side, in my support.<br> No, sir. Not so long as you support...<br> ...a gang of juvenile delinquents<br> called Youth Clubs...<br> - With a free hand to commit mayhem.<br> - Hold it!<br> Now, maybe you're right.<br> And maybe, just maybe...<br> ...the Finley Youth Club<br> was mixed up in that shindig.<br> That's why I'm gonna<br> publicly disavow, disown...<br> ...and remove my name<br> from the Finley Youth Club.<br> And if my own flesh and blood<br> was one of them hoodlums...<br> ...he's gonna pay, even though it<br> brings shame on the memory...<br> ...of his dead mother.<br> God rest her soul.<br> They say I stole the oil rights.<br> Well, if I did, I stole it<br> for my state and my people.<br> I also fought the fertilizer trust.<br> I lowered taxes. I saved our hog-raisers<br> from the Chicago meatpackers.<br> A lot of folks like what I did<br> but they don't like the way I did it.<br> But if a bunch of hogs won't come<br> out of your garden when you holler:<br> Then you've gotta use language and<br> methods that hogs and pigs understand.<br> Do you understand, Ben?<br> Hi. Martini on the rocks.<br> Say, you get any phone calls here<br> for Chance Wayne?<br> No, sir.<br> Operator? I'd like to place<br> a long-distance phone call...<br> ...to Miss Louella Parsons.<br> That's right. Person-to-person,<br> from me, Chance Wayne.<br> Yes, Miss Louella Parsons,<br> the famous movie columnist.<br> In Hollywood.<br> The number is Crestview 1-4222.<br> Fine. Thank you.<br> Oh, man, don't you know only squares<br> drink gin martinis with olives?<br> May we have a couple<br> of gin martinis, please?<br> Didn't you hear the man?<br> Only squares drink gin.<br> Wait a minute. Leroy. Could you<br> make that a couple of gin martinis...<br> ...with square olives.<br> - Scotty.<br> - Well, how are you? Bud.<br> - Hi.<br> Is that the hand that made love<br> to Jayne Mansfield?<br> Gee, I hope you didn't wash that hand.<br> Gee, I was about ready<br> to phone you guys.<br> Leroy, did you know<br> this is Chance Wayne...<br> ...the famous Hollywood<br> and Broadway celebrity?<br> - Really?<br> - Sure.<br> All bartenders become movie stars.<br> Right, Chance?<br> Oh, well... What he's<br> trying to say is that...<br> ...I had your job for too long.<br> You know, I designed<br> that uniform you've got on.<br> I copied it from an outfit Cary Grant<br> wore in this Foreign Legion picture.<br> - Looks great on you, kid.<br> - Really?<br> But kidding aside, fellas,<br> it is great to be back.<br> Louella Parsons don't answer.<br> She know it's Chance Wayne calling?<br> Operator? Yeah, well, then try...<br> Try Mr. Walter Winchell.<br> Little black book.<br> In New York at the Pla...<br> Oh, no, he's... He's in Hollywood.<br> Try Romanoff's.<br> Yeah.

I'll bet you got some...<br> ...snappy numbers<br> in that little black book, huh?<br> The best.<br> But they're not always in<br> when you call.<br> Listen, I'm throwing<br> a party tomorrow night.<br> The old crowd,<br> for Princess Kosmonopolis...<br> Royalty?<br> - In every way.<br> - Yeah.<br> No, I mean, it's mostly<br> a surprise party for Heavenly.<br> Well, I bet her old man<br> will be plenty surprised.<br> - What time?<br> - We can't.<br> - Oh, the TV rally.<br> - For Boss Finley.<br> Hey, Jackie. How about<br> a fanfare for a very important...<br> - Jackie!<br> - For a very...<br> Hey!<br> Thanks...<br> ...for remembering our song.<br> - Anytime.<br> - Was it written just for you, Mr. Wayne?<br> - Don't be square, man.<br> Don't you know that<br> all lovers got a theme song?<br> Excuse me.<br> - Sing it, Chance.<br> - Here's to the star of our crowd.<br> Here's to the man who made good.<br> Chance Wayne...<br> ... will do a front-dive layout.<br> Swan dive.<br> Thank you, laddie. Sit down.<br> Not a drinking man yourself?<br> - Oh, no, sir.<br> - Well, happy days.<br> Takes talent to whip up<br> something soothing like that.<br> Yeah...<br> ...you sure got<br> all kinds of talent, laddie.<br> You like Heavenly, don't you?<br> - I love her.<br> - Sure you do. We both love her.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Wanna marry her?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - That's the way. You're my kind of man.<br> You got ambition, ideas, youth. And the<br> good looks to go with them too. But...<br> ...working in a cocktail bar.<br> Of course, I don't blame you.<br> It's not your fault.<br> A town like this got no<br> elbow room for a go-getter.<br> No opportunity for a man<br> who's going places.<br> Yeah, but Mr. Barnaby,<br> you know, sporting goods?<br> He promised me this job as a salesman<br> in promotional sales.<br> Small potatoes.<br> Let me tell you something, laddie.<br> This here is America.<br> Today you're nobody...<br> ...tomorrow you're somebody.<br> But you got to think big, act big,<br> and you'll be big.<br> Now, I could set you up myself, but...<br> No, sir. I wouldn't want that.<br> That's the way.<br> You're my kind of man, laddie.<br> In this world,<br> there's only one payoff window.<br> Number one, the winner, success.<br> Now, that can be you.<br> But a man who's going places...<br> ...he needs a place<br> where he can climb, bust out.<br> A place like New York. Now, this here<br> is the ticket that'll get you there.<br> Train leaves at 9:40 tonight.<br> This night.<br> I'm betting this $ 100 on you, laddie...<br> ...that you come back to St. Cloud<br> number one, riding high on the hog.<br> Well, laddie.<br> But Heavenly, does she know?<br> She told me to wish you<br> luck and Godspeed.<br> Well, I know, but I wanna talk<br> to her, sir. We made a lot of plans.<br> I plumb forgot.<br> Heavenly and Aunt Nonnie left<br> for New Orleans this morning...<br> ...taking a boat for Europe.<br> Don't you go forgetting her, now.<br> You keep in touch, laddie, you hear?<br> Mr. Wayne.<br> Mr. Wayne!<br> Long distance, Mr. Wayne.<br> They can't find Walter Winchell.<br> This is some secretary named Friday.<br> Hello?<br> Yeah. Well, this is...<br> Well, when will Mr. Winchell be in?<br> No. Well, I'm calling for<br> Alexandra Del Lago, who's...<br> Disappeared? Oh, no, ma'am.<br> She... She has been searching<br> America for new faces...<br> ...and she has found them, and she has<br> signed them to a personal contract.<br> Yeah, well, see,<br> she's producing this film...<br> ...called Youth.<br> Yeah.<br> Starring Chance Wayne...<br> ...and Heavenly Finley.<br> Yeah. They're leaving<br> for Hollywood tomorrow.<br> Boy? Pencil. Please.<br> Well, the princess is unable to come<br> to the phone right now. She's out.<br> No, out for a walk.<br> Well, sure. Call any time tomorrow.<br> Thank you.<br> Operator? Say, would you<br> try the Finley residence again?<br> Good night, mayor.<br> Good night, Mrs. Norris.<br> Bye, mayor. I'll get it, Charles.<br> Hello.<br> Well, who's calling?<br> Now, listen to me,<br> you lousy son of a...<br> Boy, you just got a natural talent<br> for being mean and ornery.<br> You want me to<br> like this yellow-bellied...?<br> I'd be grateful if you'd think<br> for once.<br> What's to think about?<br> George told me lover-boy came back...<br> You already told me what George said.<br> But supposing Mr. Wayne<br> didn't just happen to come back.<br> Supposing he was sent for.<br> To smear his stink<br> over Heavenly and over me.<br> Isn't that a reason to go and...?<br> But supposing he is<br> just passing through.<br> - Well, which is it?<br> - That's what you're gonna go find out.<br> - Charles.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Where's Heavenly?<br> - She's down at the beach, sir.<br> Lay out a suit and shirt.<br> I'm going into town tonight.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Pa.<br> Get the lead out, boy.<br> Pa, you didn't mean what you said about<br> disowning the Finley Youth Clubs?<br> After what you did to the professor?<br> I've got to.<br> Burning books, Halloween masks.<br> You're just plain stupid, boy.<br> Least you could've worn white hoods<br> and burned a cross.<br> - The Klan would've been blamed.<br> - Oh, my.<br> You better stop laughing at nothing<br> or you'll end up in a nuthouse.<br> Without me you wouldn't have<br> won the election...<br> ...and you're not gonna win this one.<br> - Bull.<br> - I got you more headlines...<br> ...than the last campaign...<br> - You sure did.<br> Once for drunk driving and once for a<br> stag party cost me $5000 to hush it up.<br> Nonnie.<br> Hey, you.<br> Yeah, you.<br> What's Heavenly doing<br> down on the beach alone?<br> Just trying to be alone, I guess.<br> Sure you ain't arranged a meeting<br> between her and Mr. Wayne?<br> - No, Tom.<br> - But you did tell her he was back.<br> - Yes, Tom.<br> - Sister-in-law...<br> ...you got a powerful lot to answer for.<br> You favored Chance Wayne...<br> ...encouraged, aided and abetted<br> in his corruption of my baby.<br> That boy never could...<br> Could never knowingly harm her.<br> You're like your dead sister.<br> Gullible.<br> Hello, honey.<br> I don't like you out here all alone.<br> Why, Papa?<br> Afraid he might come along?<br> - Who might come along?<br> - Oh, Papa.<br> - I'm concerned, that's all. For you.<br> - That is very touching, Papa.<br> I'm only trying to save my baby<br> from being hurt ever again.<br> How? By insisting I marry<br> Dr. George Scudder?<br> And before him, a 50-year-old moneybags<br> you needed for your business?<br> Me? Sell my own flesh and blood?<br> More than once.<br> Remember the Texas oil tycoon?<br> And the Washington wheel?<br> All of them rich, all of them important.<br> Every one of them<br> had a powerful feeling for you.<br> There was a time when<br> you could've saved me, Papa...<br> ...by letting me marry Chance,<br> when we were both young and clean.<br> If he loved you so much,<br> why'd he run off in the first place?<br> You told him he wasn't good enough.<br> You drove him away to compete<br> with all those big shots.<br> - The point is, he went.<br> - Yes, and he tried.<br> Oh, how he tried.<br> And when the right doors<br> wouldn't open...<br> ...he went in the wrong ones.<br> Oh, don't let's fight, sugar.<br> Not you and me. Not when I need you.<br> For what, Papa? What are you<br> planning to use me for now?<br> Why, honey, ever since your angel mama<br> was took away from me...<br> ...you and your brother are all I got<br> in the world to give my love to.<br> - That doesn't speak well for Miss Lucy.<br> - Who is Miss Lucy?<br> That certainly doesn't<br> speak well for her.<br> I ain't never heard of no Miss Lucy.<br> You never heard of the woman you keep<br> in a $50-a-day suite of rooms...<br> ...at the Regal Palms Hotel?<br> That charges her clothes and<br> beauty treatments to your account?<br> And you say, "Who is Miss Lucy?"<br> Well, keep your love, Papa. Just give me<br> 10 percent of the fortune you spend...<br> ...on this woman you never heard of.<br> - You keep your mouth shut.<br> - You better tell that to Miss Lucy.<br> - You keep your mouth shut.<br> She doesn't speak<br> very well of you, Papa.<br> - She says you're not much of a lover.<br> - Who says Miss Lucy says that?<br> She wrote it with lipstick<br> in the ladies' room at the hotel bar.<br> Wrote what?<br> She wrote,<br> "Boss Finley can't cut the mustard."<br> That is a ridiculous lie.<br> Oh, Papa. I know<br> and everyone knows...<br> ...that Miss Lucy was your mistress<br> long before Mama died.<br> I never harmed your mother,<br> as God is my judge.<br> Careful, Papa. Judgment Day<br> might be any day.<br> You listen to me, you ungrateful,<br> hypocritical slut.<br> Last week, in the state capital,<br> when I was speaking on the menace...<br> ...to the chastity of womanhood,<br> a heckler almost caused a riot.<br> You know what he hollered?<br> "Hey, Boss Finley, how about your<br> daughter? How about her chastity?"<br> An honest question, Papa.<br> What was your honest answer?<br> That was my answer.<br> You have got an illusion of power,<br> Boss.<br> I have power, and that is no illusion.<br> You just won't realize<br> that I'm fighting for my life.<br> I won't embarrass you any more, Papa.<br> - I'll go away. Tonight, if you like.<br> - You're going nowhere.<br> - You're marrying George Scudder.<br> - No, Papa, I'm not.<br> - We'll discuss it tomorrow.<br> - No.<br> - All right.<br> - Not tomorrow, not ever.<br> All right. Tomorrow night, you're coming<br> to the TV rally with me, missy.<br> You're gonna wear the white of a virgin.<br> You're gonna wear a smile on your face.<br> You're gonna face that crowd and<br> TV audience with pride and defiance.<br> - That's gonna stop all those ugly rumors.<br> - I won't do it.<br> Then you won't.<br> And I'm gonna remove Chance Wayne<br> from your life finally and for the last time.<br> Now, sugar, how do you want him<br> to leave St. Cloud?<br> In that fishtail Cadillac he come in,<br> or in the garbage scow...<br> ...that dumps its filth in the gulf?<br> The choice is yours.<br> Sergeant, get my car out.<br> Did you have another attack, princess?<br> What was that strange noise?<br> - Oh, you mean the radio?<br> - Yes, it frightened me.<br> Well, some more oxygen?<br> No. No, I must look hideous in it.<br> No, honey. You just...<br> You just look exotic.<br> Yeah, like a princess from Mars,<br> or a big, magnified insect.<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> - Well, maybe I ought to call a doctor?<br> - No. No, no doctors.<br> Get me my robe.<br> When something disturbs me,<br> I just get a little short-winded, that's all.<br> What is this place? A private hospital?<br> And you. What are you?<br> Are you one of those male nurses?<br> I take care of you,<br> but I'm not your nurse.<br> But you're employed by me, is that it?<br> For some purpose or other?<br> - Yep, you're footing the bills.<br> - I see.<br> - Do you, princess?<br> - Yes, I see.<br> I'm used to footing the bills. Hey.<br> Is your money there?<br> The jewels accounted for?<br> I'm looking for a pill.<br> May I have something<br> to wash it down with?<br> You're not going to give me water.<br> Hello?<br> Oh, yes, Mr. Hatcher.<br> I'm afraid I made a mistake,<br> Mr. Wayne.<br> Those rooms you're in,<br> they're reserved for the TV rally.<br> Well, I'm sorry too, Mr. Hatcher.<br> You see, Miss Alexandra Del Lago...<br> - Don't use my name.<br> ...is sound asleep.<br> - But Miss Del Lago is in no con...<br> - Don't use my name.<br> Ask him how long he intends to stay.<br> - Well, that depends.<br> - Hang up.<br> Well, Mr. Hatcher, you wouldn't wanna<br> bear the responsibility...<br> ...for what might happen<br> to Miss Del Lago if she is...<br> I said, hang up.<br> I wanna forget who I am.<br> Well, I only used your name to stop<br> them from evicting us.<br> Will you please shut up?<br> I'm trying to forget.<br> Forgetting.<br> What are you trying to forget, princess?<br> What're you trying to hide?<br> You're all out of focus.<br> Don't I have any glasses?<br> Where are my glasses?<br> Well, you had a little accident.<br> - Oh, what was that?<br> - You fell flat on your face with them on.<br> - Where'd you put them?<br> - Lf I was in that condition...<br> ...I wouldn't know<br> where anything I had with me was.<br> Or anything I did.<br> By the way, did we do anything?<br> Mostly you've been<br> knocking yourself out...<br> ...with one thing or another.<br> Did we spend the night together?<br> Oh, yes, ma'am.<br> But I did not molest you.<br> Well, should I thank you for that<br> or accuse you of cheating?<br> I like you. You are a nice monster.<br> Well, I was born a monster. And you?<br> One lens cracked.<br> I don't mind waking up in an intimate<br> situation with someone...<br> ...but I do like to see who it is.<br> So I can make whatever adjustment<br> seems called for.<br> Well.<br> I may have done better...<br> ...but God knows I have done worse.<br> Do you remember where we met?<br> Well, this much I do remember:<br> That I like bodies...<br> ...to be silky-smooth, hard gold.<br> - Do you remember where we met?<br> - No.<br> - And the circumstances?<br> - No.<br> All I remember is us...<br> ...driving through a town<br> called Tallahassee.<br> - And before that?<br> - That water. Is that the Pacific Ocean?<br> No, ma'am, that's the gulf.<br> What gulf?<br> The gulf of misunderstanding<br> between you and me.<br> - It's not that funny.<br> - Oh, yes, it is.<br> That's exactly what Bennie Taubman<br> said to me.<br> "Sweetie, sweetie," he said...<br> - No more gulfs between you and I.<br> - Bennie.<br> This comeback will be<br> the greatest success in history.<br> - Miss Del Lago.<br> - I'm worried, Bennie.<br> You leave the worrying to me.<br> Excuse us for a minute.<br> You've been a top star for 15 years.<br> You've got millions of fans.<br> Loyal, devoted.<br> Devoted to the way I used to be,<br> the way I used to look.<br> Bennie, I am scared.<br> - You? Never.<br> - Miss Del Lago!<br> You're a professional, an artist,<br> a personality.<br> Alexandra Del Lago is the sex symbol<br> of America.<br> - Say, Charlie, how about it?<br> - She's coming.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Playback.<br> Get me a little something, will you?<br> - God, no.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I remembered the thing<br> I wanted to forget.<br> The stupid, senseless end of my life,<br> that's all.<br> No wonder I didn't want<br> to remember. I was no fool.<br> - You want some oxygen?<br> - No.<br> Where is it? Where is the stuff?<br> Did you leave it in the car?<br> I want it now.<br> Those pills aren't any good.<br> It's right here.<br> Well, that is a brilliant place to put it.<br> Hotel maid sometimes do clean<br> under mattresses, you know.<br> Wouldn't that be pretty?<br> A year in one of those model prisons<br> for distinguished addicts.<br> This is pretty high-class pot.<br> Where'd you get it?<br> You beautiful, stupid young man.<br> That is not pot.<br> It's hashish. Moroccan, and the finest.<br> Pop star. It's insanity.<br> The legend of Alexandra Del Lago was...<br> Was youth.<br> I was right. I told him I was right.<br> Why...?<br> Why didn't I trust my instincts?<br> They've stood me in good stead<br> for many, many a year.<br> Where does one retire to?<br> There is no place to retire to<br> when you retire from the movies.<br> No place except oblivion.<br> One thing that'll help you<br> forget oblivion is...<br> This. It's this.<br> If I had just been old.<br> But, you see, I wasn't old.<br> I just wasn't young. Not young.<br> I just wasn't young anymore.<br> Nobody's young anymore.<br> Stars in retirement<br> sometimes give acting lessons.<br> They give beauty hints,<br> they write gossip columns.<br> Princess, just smoke.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Smoke.<br> And after this...<br> ...the mercenary young lovers.<br> - Like me?<br> - Yes, like you.<br> Your comeback. I mean, what happened?<br> You just didn't have it anymore?<br> Oh, I had it. I had the will<br> and I had the talent to go with it.<br> But the camera.<br> The camera doesn't know how to lie.<br> The screen is a very clear mirror.<br> There is a thing, God help us,<br> called a close-up.<br> Camera number one in position.<br> Finish your candles, there, boys.<br> Playback.<br> The camera dollies in.<br> And you, your head, your face...<br> ... are caught in the frame<br> with the lights blazing.<br> And all your terrible history<br> screams while you smile.<br> No. No, no, no. Hold it, hold it.<br> I told you I want a shadow right here<br> on her neck. You understand?<br> Not your fault, sweetie. You're terrific.<br> Okay, Charlie. We go again.<br> Right now.<br> - Camera, number one position.<br> - Playback.<br> - Quiet.<br> - All right, places, everybody.<br> And then, before you know it,<br> comes the night of the preview.<br> The first part of the film, I felt so safe.<br> - What did you say her name was?<br> - Alexandra Del Lago, stupe.<br> I thought she was dead and buried.<br> Sweetie, wait. Believe me. Please.<br> Miss Del Lago, one more picture, please.<br> She fell. Oh, poor thing.<br> - She's drunk.<br> - They're all drunks, all of them.<br> After that, flight.<br> Running away from that<br> frightful comeback.<br> I never stopped running until now.<br> - Know what you need right now?<br> - Yes, to forget again.<br> First we...<br> We let the hash take effect.<br> And then...<br> ...we apply the magic formula.<br> What?<br> Like we did in Palm Beach, remember?<br> That soothing, magical formula<br> called papaya cream.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Papaya-cream rubs.<br> Were you one of those faceless<br> young bodies in Palm Beach?<br> Well, that's where we met.<br> Don't you remember, in your<br> private cabana, on the beach?<br> And you were breathless.<br> I mean, just like you are right now.<br> It was painful. Painful to see.<br> And you were the anesthetic<br> that eased my pain.<br> Yeah, and you were smoking.<br> Just like you are right now.<br> That feels so...<br> I don't remember your face,<br> but your hands are familiar.<br> There. That hash,<br> how'd you get hooked?<br> On my way to Europe,<br> running away from my comeback.<br> The ship's doctor gave me injections.<br> Did he know he was giving narcotics<br> to the famous Alexandra Del Lago?<br> He just knew he was helping a woman<br> suffering from neuritis.<br> The hashish came later. In Tangier.<br> How'd you get it into the States,<br> smuggle it?<br> Know another way?<br> You mean you smuggled it right past<br> customs, princess?<br> What are you trying to prove?<br> Nothing. No, I just...<br> Don't forget, you're the one<br> that introduced me...<br> ...to this fine old Moroccan hash.<br> Boy, I doubt very much<br> if I have any vice...<br> ...old or new,<br> that I could introduce to you.<br> - Ma'am, don't call me boy.<br> - You knew all about this stuff, Carl.<br> - My name is not Carl, it's Chance.<br> - You called yourself Carl in Palm Beach.<br> I always carry an extra name<br> in my pocket.<br> Why, are you a criminal?<br> No, ma'am, not me.<br> I mean, you're the one that's committed<br> a federal crime.<br> What'd you do that for?<br> I thought you might've<br> planted someone outside the door.<br> Don't you trust me?<br> Who taught you to rub<br> desperate ladies the right way?<br> And you say all you did<br> was manipulate the papaya cream?<br> - Well, more or less.<br> - How much more?<br> Ma'am, if we'd made love,<br> you'd have remembered it.<br> Well, what stopped you? Certainly not I.<br> And certainly not your ethics.<br> What's the angle?<br> Why did you hold out?<br> I held out till you signed a contract.<br> Well, evidently I signed.<br> Why did you still hold out?<br> - I wanted to hold your interest.<br> - Well, you miscalculated.<br> My interest always increases<br> with satisfaction.<br> You mean you don't intend<br> to live up to that contract?<br> I can get out of that contract<br> any time I want to.<br> - Do you have any talent?<br> - For what?<br> Acting, baby.<br> Acting. A contract for acting<br> implies that you are an actor. Are you?<br> I've been an extra in movies<br> long enough to know that...<br> ...I can be as big a star as some of them<br> she-men that have made it. Princess.<br> Princess?<br> All I need is just one big break.<br> - Carl, it takes more than one break.<br> - Chance. Chance. Chance Wayne.<br> - You're stoned.<br> - Baby, there is no easy way to the top.<br> You can forget about magic formulas<br> and trick contracts.<br> Forget about this false dream.<br> Okay, say it, princess.<br> What is it you want?<br> Come here. Let's comfort<br> each other a little.<br> That's right.<br> Princess?<br> You know something, honey?<br> That all that talk about narcotics...<br> ...it's been recorded on tape.<br> - Where did you get that thing?<br> - You bought it for me in Palm Beach.<br> To improve my diction.<br> - Comeback. The ship 's doctor<br> gave me injections.<br> Did he know he was giving narcotics<br> to the famous Alexandra Del Lago?<br> He just knew he was helping a woman<br> suffering from neuritis.<br> The hashish came later. In Tangier.<br> - Blackmail, is it?<br> - That's very ugly language.<br> The language of the gutter is understood<br> by anyone who ever fell in it. Price?<br> I just want you<br> to live up to this contract.<br> - And that's not all.<br> - Money?<br> - And if I refuse?<br> - Well, you won't.<br> You wouldn't want the FBI<br> to get ahold of these recordings.<br> - Chance.<br> - Or the newspapers...<br> ...and those bigshot columnists?<br> And the dirt magazines?<br> Princess, you got a big name<br> to protect. You still got a reputation.<br> I had, baby, I had.<br> I have been blackmailed by experts.<br> I hate to think what desperation<br> has made you think...<br> ...that you can try to intimidate me.<br> Me, Alexandra Del Lago,<br> with this ridiculous...<br> Oh, Chance, it's silly.<br> It's so silly, it's touching.<br> It's downright endearing.<br> Makes me feel close to you.<br> Now, I gotta see somebody.<br> I want some cash and I want your car.<br> Here. Here. Now, you'd better start<br> signing these traveler's checks, or I'll...<br> Or what? Oh, put that away,<br> and that leaky fountain pen.<br> When monster meets monster,<br> one monster has to give way...<br> ...and it will never be me.<br> Now, then, signed checks are payment.<br> Delivery comes first.<br> I have only one way to forget the things<br> that I don't want to remember...<br> ...and that way is through making love.<br> It's the only dependable distraction,<br> and I need that distraction right now.<br> In the morning, we'll talk about<br> what you want and what you need.<br> Aren't you ashamed a little?<br> Yes. Aren't you?<br> More than a little.<br> Close the curtains, please.<br> Then come here to me.<br> And make me almost believe<br> that we are a pair of young lovers...<br> ...without any shame.<br> Two things, Pa.<br> First, he's bedding in with a broken-down<br> old movie star, Alexandra Del Lago.<br> But she's still famous and capable<br> of causing us trouble...<br> Second, Mr. Wayne don't show<br> any inclination to move on.<br> I told him...<br> ...she's not well enough to travel.<br> - Bull.<br> If you roughhouse this woman,<br> every newspaper's gonna be down here.<br> But if we separate Mr. Wayne<br> from his lady...<br> ...we could proceed more directly,<br> if it was necessary.<br> Right, sir. You're the doctor,<br> call an ambulance.<br> - Haul queenie to the hospital.<br> - Without her permission?<br> Say she's contagious.<br> Bubonic plague, typhoid fever.<br> - I'm not gonna let you involve me in this.<br> - Lower your voice.<br> - He's not gonna involve me in this...<br> - Doctor, laddie...<br> ...you are already involved right up<br> to your scrofulous chicken neck.<br> I've done anything you ever asked me.<br> Anything.<br> But one public mistake,<br> one slip, and we...<br> Laddie, you've got all the symptoms<br> of a nervous breakdown.<br> Now, my prescription for you<br> is a weekend vacation.<br> A change of scenery<br> to build up your backbone.<br> I'd say you're sickly. Critical.<br> Might be even terminal.<br> So you'd better leave quick. Tonight.<br> - See the doc don't miss his train.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Happy Easter, Fly.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Happy Easter.<br> - Thank you, governor.<br> - Shall I ring her, say you're coming up?<br> - No.<br> Lucy?<br> Lucy?<br> Hiya, honey.<br> I'll be with you in a second.<br> How can you watch two TVs,<br> chop your toenails...<br> ...stuff yourself with chocolates<br> all at the same time?<br> I already seen the movie.<br> Shut that damn thing off.<br> I said, shut it...!<br> My, my, my.<br> Ain't we in a mood.<br> Guess what I got for you,<br> for an Easter present.<br> I went all the way<br> to New Orleans for it.<br> Close your eyes, lover.<br> This is a mighty exciting surprise.<br> Don't look.<br> Like?<br> Is that for me?<br> Well, I surely don't intend to give it<br> to anybody else.<br> Oh, feast your tired old eyes,<br> daddy doll.<br> I sure do hope that this brings out<br> the beast in you.<br> Happy Easter, sugar.<br> For me?<br> You'll spoil me yet, honey.<br> Oh, why, it's lovely.<br> It's a lovely Easter egg.<br> Am I supposed to eat it?<br> Open the top.<br> It sure takes a powerful kind of rooster<br> to lay this kind of egg.<br> Oh, darling, you shouldn't have.<br> Why not? You deserve<br> everything you get.<br> Oh, I'm so nervous.<br> Like it, sugar baby?<br> It's absolutely divine.<br> It's heavenly.<br> That's better. Now...<br> ...you go downstairs to the<br> ladies' room of the cocktail lounge...<br> ...and you write on the toilet mirror<br> with this same lipstick:<br> "Miss Lucy is available to any punk's<br> got $5 and can cut the mustard."<br> You know, I don't very much<br> like my Easter surprise.<br> Hello? Operator, did you get<br> the Finley residence yet?<br> Aunt Nonnie?<br> Well, can you talk now?<br> Well, can I see you, then?<br> Well, I can... Where?<br> Well, how soon?<br> All right. I'll meet you there.<br> Aunt Nonnie, whatever it is<br> that happened, I can explain.<br> And listen...<br> ...I got it made.<br> No, I really got it made.<br> All right.<br> Princess?<br> Princess?<br> Pure, hard gold, all right.<br> Yeah. Well, I'm glad<br> you're appreciative...<br> ...but, you know, I'm going out pretty<br> soon and my credit is kind of shaky.<br> I would like to smoke, please.<br> No, no. Just one of the ordinary<br> cigarettes that only give you cancer.<br> What are those lovely bells?<br> Why, madam, it is Easter Sunday.<br> How fitting. I feel absolutely reborn.<br> Yes. The world and I are on<br> very good terms this morning.<br> Yeah, well, we made a little bargain<br> last night, remember?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Well, I will live up to my end<br> of the bargain...<br> ...after I have put on my face.<br> The face I face the world with, baby.<br> Will you open the curtains, please?<br> There something out there<br> you're afraid of?<br> Oh, no, ma'am. The thing I want most<br> in the world is out there.<br> This town belonged to me once.<br> And will again.<br> Were you born here?<br> - On the wrong side of the tracks, but...<br> - Well, most of us were, baby.<br> You know, the set that I ran with<br> was a snob set.<br> You know, they had family,<br> big names, big money.<br> - All I had was...<br> - Beauty.<br> Say it. What you had was beauty.<br> I had it, and I say it with pride.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, the others were born satisfied.<br> Well, I had to get something better.<br> And I did.<br> I got it.<br> While my friends were<br> doing the conventional things...<br> ...like flunking out<br> of state university...<br> ...I appeared in the biggest stage hit<br> on Broadway.<br> I had my picture on the cover of<br> LIFE magazine.<br> And, at the same time...<br> ...I was employing my other talent,<br> lovemaking.<br> That may be the only talent<br> you were ever truly meant for.<br> I've wallowed in a social register<br> of New York...<br> ...with discreet wives<br> in the millionaire set...<br> ...and debutante daughters<br> in the horsy set.<br> Did they foot the bills too?<br> Yeah. But I always gave them<br> much more than I took.<br> To older women, I gave back a feeling<br> of excitement and youth.<br> To sad, lost women...<br> ...a merciful display of affection<br> and temporary hope.<br> Eccentrics?<br> Understanding, tolerance.<br> You must have been quite<br> a successful enterprise.<br> - Oh, I was going places.<br> - Where?<br> Successville.<br> My name was appearing in columns...<br> ...I was promised this part<br> in a big Broadway play...<br> ...Hollywood was nibbling.<br> I was getting to be somebody.<br> Then it was time for me<br> to come home for my girl...<br> ...take her away with me,<br> like I promised.<br> And when I came home, oh, man.<br> This town just buzzed<br> with excitement.<br> Chance.<br> She never asked about the others.<br> Well, she didn 't have to.<br> Of course, she knew that nothing I did<br> or was done to...<br> ... could ever cancel out our love,<br> the pleasure we gave each other.<br> You know, the big difference<br> between people...<br> ...is not between rich and poor<br> or good and evil.<br> The biggest of all differences<br> between people...<br> ...is between those that have had<br> pleasure in love and those that haven't.<br> We interrupt this program to bring you<br> a bulletin from Washington.<br> It was officially announced<br> that United States ground forces...<br> ... entered the Korean War today.<br> President Truman termed<br> the intervention a police action.<br> And I am positive there's no finer,<br> no braver, no more patriotic man...<br> ...to lead our Dixie Regiment<br> than our own hometown boy...<br> ...Chance Wayne.<br> Congratulations.<br> All I could think was,<br> "This stops everything."<br> Just when things were going great...<br> ...the end. Period. Even if I was lucky,<br> I'd have to start all over again.<br> You and a few million others.<br> Their jobs would be waiting for them,<br> but my trade was youth.<br> And war either makes you age fast<br> or die fast.<br> Imagine, a whole lifetime...<br> ...full of hopes and dreams<br> and ambitions...<br> ...being wiped out<br> by a 2-ounce accident like a bullet.<br> A bullet shot off<br> into space by anybody.<br> And my head and that bullet<br> at the same place at the same time.<br> Only, it wasn't a bullet that got me,<br> it was my nerves.<br> A month in a hospital,<br> a medical discharge.<br> And when I came home that time,<br> there was no parties, no banners...<br> ...no picture in the newspaper.<br> - So you ran away again.<br> - Yeah.<br> And I finally made it to Hollywood.<br> And failed again.<br> That time.<br> But not this time.<br> Princess. Now, I've got a few things<br> to iron out right now.<br> But tonight you give this big<br> press conference, see?<br> You know, to tell the world about this<br> new discovery you signed up.<br> The last thing I want is publicity.<br> I know, but this will prove that<br> young talent is your real interest in life.<br> Which it certainly is not.<br> My real, my only, interest in life is me,<br> Alexandra Del Lago.<br> Besides, a movie starring<br> our special talent...<br> ...would be banned in all 50 states,<br> censored worldwide.<br> Princess, I am taking your car.<br> - Well, when will I see you?<br> - Wait here.<br> I don't like waiting for anybody.<br> Baby.<br> Morning, Miss Finley.<br> What is it, sergeant?<br> Nothing, miss.<br> Just sort of spying?<br> No, ma'am. Just sort of<br> watching over you.<br> Easter must be a very dangerous time.<br> Guess so, miss.<br> - The ladies ready for church?<br> - Miss Nonnie's already gone, sir.<br> - She took a taxi.<br> - I see.<br> - She get any calls this morning?<br> - The phone rang.<br> She talked to somebody.<br> No, sir, Mr. Finley.<br> I don't know who to.<br> Get my Bible.<br> Good morning.<br> Nice morning, Mr. Finley.<br> Thank you, laddie.<br> You look mighty sweet, sugar.<br> I would like you to call off<br> your bloodhound, Papa.<br> I would like you to behave<br> like a daughter should.<br> Well, did you meditate<br> on Mr. Wayne's future?<br> At the present, he is enjoying life...<br> ...in the loving arms<br> of a famous Hollywood siren.<br> Hey, Pa, if Chance is living<br> with a real princess...<br> ...does that make him royalty too?<br> It makes him what he always was:<br> A criminal degenerate and parasite.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Chance?<br> She never blamed you for anything.<br> She always had...<br> Nothing.<br> I gave her nothing, Aunt Nonnie.<br> She lived lonely and she died lonely.<br> Gee, I'm glad to see you.<br> I came here to tell you one thing.<br> Well, I was sort of hoping<br> that you'd bring Heavenly.<br> Go away before it's too late.<br> Before her father...<br> Why won't they let me see her,<br> Aunt Nonnie? Because she and George...?<br> - I can't talk about it.<br> - Why?<br> Why? Now, why, Aunt Nonnie?<br> I just can't talk about it.<br> Please. Please help me, Aunt Nonnie.<br> You were always able to...<br> See, you were like a mother to me.<br> You always called me son.<br> Why did you stop calling me son?<br> Oh, Chance, go away<br> before it's too late.<br> I am not leaving here<br> till I talk to Heavenly or see her.<br> Now, you tell her that.<br> Aunt Nonnie, I got a right.<br> Goodbye, son.<br> Aunt Nonnie.<br> - Aunt Nonnie, I'm taking you to church.<br> - No, Chance.<br> I'm afraid. Afraid for you.<br> Take your sister on in.<br> - Happy Easter.<br> - Happy Easter, mayor.<br> Well, look here.<br> Glad to see you, laddie.<br> Hold it, Mr. Finley. Thank you, sir.<br> It's no use, Mr. Finley, l...<br> Laddie, I hear you're consorting<br> with a genuine princess.<br> Guess that sort of makes you a prince,<br> don't it?<br> Happy Easter, Mrs. Cavanaugh.<br> Well, God bless you, Mr. Finley.<br> I once had a dog called Prince.<br> I had to butcher him to keep all<br> the bitches in town from being violated.<br> Deacon, I'm counting on your<br> support at the rally.<br> - Up, the rebels!<br> - Let's see, now.<br> - When did you last visit us?<br> - Why won't you let me see her, sir?<br> I remember, you hit town last time<br> in a freight car.<br> You saw my daughter then...<br> ...and you left her<br> carrying your bastard then too.<br> Let you see her?<br> Sure, prince, when I've had you<br> taken care of like my dog.<br> I remember, you hit town last time<br> in a freight car.<br> No, I'll get you dirty.<br> Hold me. Just hold me. Hold me.<br> What are you thinking?<br> I was just... I was just feeling<br> kind of peaceful and easy...<br> ...listening to those freewheeling birds<br> coming home.<br> If we could just be like one of them<br> out there, just free as a bird.<br> No one in love is free<br> or even wants to be.<br> You know what I was thinking?<br> About those five days and nights<br> on those freight cars.<br> Thinking that, "Heavenly will make me<br> feel clean again.<br> She'll wash away all the..."<br> What's it like...<br> ...in movie land?<br> Oh, it is like no place<br> in this world, baby.<br> In fact, it's not even a place,<br> it's a state of mind...<br> ...with a stone wall around it<br> a mile high.<br> "Strange birds, keep out."<br> No, it's the strange ones that get in.<br> I know.<br> Why, I've been clawing away<br> at that wall...<br> ...for over a year now,<br> trying to get on the inside.<br> This last year's been...<br> - Wasted?<br> - No.<br> No, just a run of bad breaks,<br> back-to-back.<br> Nothing's wasted that teaches you<br> how to operate, how to beat the game.<br> Last year's the best investment<br> I ever made.<br> Oh, next time I'm gonna get lucky.<br> And then I'm gonna<br> take you with me...<br> ...right through that stone wall,<br> first class, straight to the top.<br> Again, Chance?<br> I got the key now, baby.<br> I got the know-how. That Hollywood<br> merry-go-round is a pushover.<br> Today they're stepping on your feet,<br> tomorrow they're kissing your feet.<br> I know, I have seen it. Well...<br> ...that merry-go-round<br> is gonna carry me.<br> It's gonna carry me all the way.<br> And then before you know it,<br> before you know it...<br> ...I'm gonna have that brass ring,<br> that lucky brass ring right here.<br> - Which gets you what?<br> - It gets you the prize...<br> ...honey, money, success, happiness.<br> No. All the brass ring gets you<br> is a free ride on a wooden horse...<br> ...that's going nowhere except<br> up and down and round and round.<br> My papa sold you that phony dream...<br> ...and you're still buying it.<br> How does he say it?<br> "All you need is one lucky break.<br> Something for nothing.<br> Beat the game, hit the jackpot."<br> Anyone can be a millionaire,<br> so everybody's got to try it.<br> That's right. And why not?<br> There are a lot of ways you can make it,<br> and for me there is one quick way.<br> Now, just stick with me, baby,<br> and when I come back next time...<br> - Another next time.<br> - No, this time I got a job.<br> I got a big job in Palm Beach mixing<br> with all kinds of important people.<br> Take me with you. Please.<br> No, I can't, baby. Not yet.<br> You know, in this job,<br> I gotta travel fast.<br> And I gotta travel alone.<br> This is the job, baby.<br> This is the job that's gonna get me<br> inside that magic door.<br> All my life, I've been on the outside.<br> And time is running out.<br> Now, look around you. Boy, they got<br> places for the old and the sick...<br> ...and the homeless,<br> but no place for the failures.<br> And failure is<br> a highly contagious disease.<br> What kind of job is it, Chance?<br> - Oh, baby, it is golden. Just gold...<br> - Chance.<br> Beach boy.<br> To a bunch of fat-bottomed<br> broads at this swank hotel.<br> - But it's a beginning.<br> - Stay here. We'll find something.<br> Baby, I can't. Have you forgotten<br> what's expected of me?<br> I want you as you are.<br> Then look at me as I am.<br> I'm a nothing.<br> A nobody.<br> I couldn't write a check for $2<br> without getting arrested.<br> Busted. Flat broke.<br> I'm ashamed to go home<br> and let my mother look at me.<br> I always dreamed of<br> coming back here like a...<br> Oh, like...<br> Don't ask me to give up my dream.<br> Excuse me.<br> Supposing he comes over, Pa.<br> Well, sugar, it's up to you.<br> Let him alone.<br> I'll be there with you tonight.<br> Just let him alone.<br> - I want him gone before the rally starts.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Not here, stupid. See him alone.<br> He's to go quietly.<br> No fuss. No violence, you hear?<br> Yes, sir. You're the boss, Pa.<br> And don't you ever forget it.<br> No, sir.<br> Does this lovely hotel<br> have a hairdresser?<br> Oh, yes, ma'am. And a drugstore,<br> a cocktail bar...<br> ...tennis courts,<br> everything to make folks happy.<br> Thank you.<br> Chance?<br> Long who?<br> Long distance?<br> There is no Alexandra Del Lago here,<br> operator.<br> Who is it?<br> I am not...!<br> Operator, I ought to know who I am.<br> Just a minute. Just a minute.<br> - Chan...<br> - Excuse me, princess...<br> Whatever you are selling, no.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can't hold<br> these rooms any longer.<br> What did you say?<br> Will you repeat what you said.<br> Ma'am, he says your checkout time<br> is long past.<br> My checkout time at any hotel<br> in the world is when l...<br> Is when I want to check out.<br> Who told you you could<br> come into my bedroom?<br> - Now, where is Chance? Mr. Wayne?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Your companion. Now, where is he?<br> - Who wants to know?<br> This is the assistant manager,<br> and I am Tom Finley Jr.<br> Well, I hardly imagined<br> that you were a senior.<br> Out, both of you.<br> Hatcher, better wait for me<br> downstairs, please.<br> - Now, Miss Del Lago...<br> - I am the Princess Kosmonopolis...<br> Shut up.<br> Miss Del Lago, you ought to be<br> more careful of the company you keep.<br> Operator.<br> Op... Just a moment, please.<br> Do you want me to call the police?<br> All right, you go ahead.<br> Do that, Miss Del Lago.<br> You tell them you spent the night<br> in an orgy with a criminal degenerate.<br> No, hon. Never mind.<br> Now, knowing him,<br> I figure you were victimized.<br> You're a rich, famous,<br> respected person, princess.<br> You don't want any trouble.<br> Thank you.<br> And now, if you are through<br> trying to frighten me...<br> ...or shake me down, or whatever,<br> I would like to finish my breakfast.<br> Yes, ma'am. Go right ahead.<br> May I ask you<br> what Mr. Wayne is to you?<br> You may not.<br> He's... He drives my car.<br> He's in my employ. He's my driver.<br> What are you doing here in St. Cloud?<br> Okay, he brought you here. Why?<br> We're just passing through.<br> - That's all.<br> - Well, fine. Just pass right on through.<br> But you tell that scum<br> to drive you out of here quick.<br> - On whose authority?<br> - Mine.<br> Well, even in this impossible place,<br> you couldn't represent the law.<br> There isn't any law<br> that covers the Chance Waynes.<br> Not after what he did to me<br> and to my family.<br> - What?<br> - You just never mind.<br> - What did he do?<br> - Never you mind.<br> You tell him that I said<br> if he don't pass through...<br> ...his life ain't worth spit in the wind.<br> Well, sometime you come on back<br> and see us, hear?<br> We'll lay out the red carpet for you.<br> Okay?<br> Well, so long, Miss Del Lago.<br> Nightfall. Now, you and him<br> be gone by nightfall.<br> You hear me?<br> Oh, where? Where did he put it?<br> Where?<br> Oh, Chance.<br> Chance.<br> Operator.<br> Operator.

Well, then send me<br> a bottle of anything.<br> And operator?<br> Operator, I want you to find<br> Mr. Chance Wayne for me.<br> Well, page him.<br> And try that happy<br> cocktail bar of yours.<br> - Change for a quarter.<br> - Thank you.<br> Did you arrange to have that<br> prescription filled yet?<br> I'll check, Mr. Wayne.<br> Hello? Professor Smith?<br> You can't beat Boss Finley<br> by making speeches about God...<br> ...or by heckling him about chastity...<br> ...because the Boss has a patent<br> on that jazz.<br> He's a low-down hillbilly.<br> And it takes a hillbilly to cut down<br> a hillbilly, and that's me.<br> Don't bother about my name.<br> You just appear at that rally tonight<br> and ask him one question:<br> Why did Boss Finley make Dr. Scudder<br> chief of staff at the hospital?<br> Operator, are there any calls<br> for a Chance Wayne?<br> No, I mean outside calls.<br> Well, page me if there are, will you?<br> Chance?<br> Chance "High-Stepping" Wayne.<br> Hey, hey, Miss Lucy.<br> Honey, you used to be so attractive,<br> I couldn't stand it.<br> Now I can. Almost stand it.<br> Well, boy, you still look like<br> a million dollars, there, Miss Lucy.<br> Confederate money.<br> Hey, a year ago you would have<br> laughed at that.<br> - Well, I must be faint with thirst.<br> - Thirsty?

Drop dead.<br> What happened to your finger?<br> It got caught in your big,<br> fat blabbermouth.<br> Hey, honey, you wanna laugh?<br> Listen. Last night, Finley gave me this<br> for an Easter gift.<br> Well, he has always been generous.<br> Well, that's not all he gave me.<br> He gave me the treatment,<br> the full Finley treatment.<br> Ending up canceling my rooms,<br> my credit and my welcome.<br> And this morning, I was handed a ticket<br> to New Orleans. One way.<br> Well, that man has an irresistible passion<br> to see other people traveling.<br> Does he know you're back in town?<br> I would say he is<br> aware of my presence.<br> What's in the pill, honey?<br> Well, when you are having fun,<br> this makes you have even more.<br> Are you? Having fun?<br> Baby, I'm having a ball.<br> Honey, I'm an expert<br> at pretending to have fun.<br> You are having a wake, not a ball.<br> Mr. Wayne?

It's a wonderful thing<br> that has happened to me.<br> I felt something for somebody<br> besides myself.<br> You know what that means?<br> That means that my heart is still alive.<br> Still alive, Chance.<br> Well, you've got a wise heart,<br> princess.<br> Oh, I need you.<br> And we need each other.<br> We'll help each other.<br> You won't find me ungrateful.<br> Chance, I am truly ashamed<br> of last night.<br> I will never degrade you...<br> ...nor myself.<br> I understand. Now, please, princess.<br> You want a screen test?<br> You'll have your test.<br> I'll honor that contract.<br> I'll make it good.<br> I'll make it even better.<br> Oh, princess, you are a glorious,<br> beautiful, lovely...<br> Monster. Drive, baby, drive.<br> Break every speed law from here...<br> No. No, baby.<br> - Princess, I got unfinished business.<br> - Don't leave me again. Not now.<br> - I got to.<br> - Chance!<br> Chance.<br> Chance, you'll never come back.<br> They'll cut the life out of you.<br> - Princess, go up to the room and wait.<br> - No, please. Please, baby.<br> I can't be alone now.<br> Don't ask me to stay. Please.<br> Just give me this one last break.<br> Oh, Chance. Chance. Chance!<br> Don't send me back<br> to that room alone.<br> We could both do<br> with some comfort, honey.<br> Southern Comfort, 100 proof?<br> Thank you, miss.<br> Give the hicks a show, miss.<br> You show them you're a real princess.<br> It's good public relations.<br> Public? The public and I have always<br> enjoyed the very best relations.<br> Hi there.<br> Wouldn't you like to have a nice,<br> cool dip before lunch?<br> - Don't you go away, now.<br> - No, ma'am.<br> No.<br> Dear, she shouldn't have gone anywhere<br> without you, should she?<br> No, ma'am, she shouldn't have.<br> Go away, Chance. Go away.<br> Leave here. Leave St. Cloud.<br> - Well, yeah, we'll leave here together.<br> - It's too late for that.<br> Baby, it's just the beginning for us.<br> Now, no more next time.<br> This time, it's for keeps.<br> We got it made, baby.<br> This is my passport out of here.<br> Right to the top, nonstop.<br> Let go, Chance.<br> Let go of my life.<br> But, baby, the door is opened.<br> This is a contract!<br> Now, it's witnessed and notarized<br> and signed by Alexandra Del Lago.<br> She's my patroness.<br> She's my agent, my producer.<br> This is on the level.<br> - You've gotta believe me!<br> - I believe you.<br> All right, then. We'll leave here.<br> Together.<br> You and me and Princess Del Lago.<br> Tonight. Whenever you say.<br> Take your princess and go away.<br> Now. Before tonight.<br> You want me<br> to leave here without you?<br> Don't come back.<br> Don't call anymore. Run!<br> But, baby, what about you?<br> What about you and me?<br> Forget about me!<br> You want me to forget<br> that you're carrying my baby?<br> Yes! The way I had to forget!<br> Go back to your dream!<br> - You got the loudspeaker tested?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How about the TV setup? Okay?<br> - Yeah. Okay.<br> - I want you to stand by for a surprise.<br> - What kind of surprise?<br> I don't know. I got an anonymous<br> phone call, so just stand by.<br> Yes, ma'am, princess!<br> Honey,<br> get the bill ready for suite 212.<br> - Miss Lucy, your bill's been paid in full.<br> - That's what you think.<br> - Hold on.<br> - Tom Jr., they're checking out.<br> The princess lady<br> just asked for the bill.<br> Come here.<br> You just had to see him, didn't you?<br> You just naturally had to lay<br> in Chance Wayne's arms like a trollop.<br> Folks, my daughter!<br> Who says purity and politics<br> don't go together?<br> Well!<br> I thought,<br> from the happy celebration...<br> ...that you were being served on a platter<br> with an apple stuck in your mouth.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Getting out of here.<br> - As fast as your car will take us.<br> - Oh, well. I have another driver.<br> A certain Miss Lucy.<br> A kindly soul who will drive me<br> out of this hellish nightmare...<br> ...as far as New Orleans.<br> I'm still your driver, princess.<br> We're leaving here together.<br> What happened<br> to your unfinished business?<br> Floppola?<br> - Well, I'm back. Isn't that enough?<br> - In a word, no.<br> - Oh, princess, baby...<br> - No!<br> Don't answer that.<br> Chance!<br> - Hello?<br> - I told you not to.<br> - Who's calling the princess?<br> - Will you please, please hang up?<br> It's Walter Winchell, in Hollywood.<br> Oh, no.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Yeah, put him on.<br> - No. No!<br> - Yeah, she's right here.<br> Oh, how did he find me? How?<br> - It was you.<br> - Hello? Hello, Mr. Winchell?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Well, this is Chance Wayne speaking.<br> I called for the<br> Princess Kosmonopolis.<br> Alexandra...!<br> I mean, Alexandra Del Lago.<br> Last night?<br> Oh, yeah. She's fine, fine.<br> She just wanted to tell you about<br> this new star that she's discovered.<br> - Oh, sure, she can talk for herself.<br> - I can't.<br> - Princess, come on. He's waiting.<br> - Well, you tell him that I am dying.<br> And I just might.<br> You gotta meet it halfway.<br> Princess?<br> Walter?<br> Walter?<br> Walter! Well, is that really you, Waldo?<br> Yes, yes, it's me. Alexandra.<br> That's what's left of me.<br> Walter?<br> Oh, yes, yes, I did go to the preview,<br> but I only stayed a few minutes.<br> As soon I saw that first big close-up of<br> myself on that monstrous CinemaScope...<br> ...I tell you, I ran right out of there!<br> I screamed for a taxi,<br> and I haven't been...<br> I haven't stopped running since.<br> What?<br> Oh, no, no. No, no, I heard nothing,<br> read nothing, I just wanted oblivion.<br> What?<br> Walter.<br> You're just being kind, aren't you?<br> Princess, tell him<br> about my screen test.<br> - One moment, Walter, I'm breathless.<br> - Tell him to break it in his column...<br> Go in the bathroom and stick<br> your head under cold water.<br> Walter, now, tell me,<br> do you really think so?<br> You're not just being kind,<br> are you, because of old times?<br> Grown, did you say? My talent?<br> Well, in what way, Walter?<br> - More depth?<br> - Tell him about me.<br> - More what? What did you say?<br> - Me.<br> More power?<br> - Well, God bless you. God bless you!<br> - Come on, now, cut the chatter.<br> Tell him you've found a new<br> leading man with a bright new future.<br> Walter, that is very,<br> very sweet of you.<br> I don't even care if you're not altogether<br> sincere in that statement, Walter...<br> ...because I think you know what<br> the past 15 years have been like.<br> What?<br> What's that, Walter?<br> They want me?<br> They really want me?<br> Well, for what part?<br> Who? Who wants me?<br> Oh, dear Lord.<br> Walter!<br> Walter, please excuse me.<br> No, no. Excuse me. I'm crying, dear,<br> and I haven't got any Kleenex.<br> Come on, talk to him about me.<br> - Oh, Walter...<br> - Me, me, me!<br> Walter, what?<br> No, no, I didn't read the reviews.<br> Newspapers.<br> Who cares what the newspapers say?<br> What did they say? Tell me.<br> Tell me word for word.<br> Before the festivities, let us all<br> bow our heads in silent prayer.<br> Mrs. Maribelle Norris<br> will sing while we pray.<br> Good night, professor.<br> Can't we do this<br> without hurting the girl?<br> Do you wanna get rid<br> of Boss Finley or not?<br> Yes. Oh, no!<br> Oh, Walter, the New Yorker magazine<br> praised it.<br> Oh, I'm too overwhelmed. I'm...<br> Walter, I'll have to call you back later.<br> - I can't believe it. I can't believe it.<br> - Hello?<br> My picture has broken box-office records<br> in New York and L.A.<br> - Get him back on this phone.<br> - Variety says...<br> ...that I am the biggest boff<br> in release today.<br> - Princess, I took care of you.<br> - I've gotta go to a clinic for a week.<br> - I delivered my end.<br> - A week or 10 days.<br> Would you shut up and listen!<br> Bennie. I'll have to get him to cover up<br> my tracks these past few weeks in hell.<br> - Get Winchell back on this phone.<br> - What?<br> Tell him about me!<br> What? Tell him about a beach boy<br> that I picked up for pleasure...<br> ...a distraction from panic?<br> Now? Now, when the<br> nightmare is over?<br> And involve my name<br> with the name of a...<br> A blackmailer.<br> You've just been using me. Using me.<br> When you ran out on me downstairs,<br> you ran out on this contract too.<br> Just a short while ago, I needed you.<br> Oh, how I needed you.<br> Well, now I need nobody.<br> I climbed up alone.<br> And I will climb back alone.<br> Back to where I belong.<br> I will live alone and I will work alone.<br> I know exactly the kind<br> of gold-plated hell I'm going to.<br> But you, you have gone past something<br> you couldn't afford to go past.<br> Your time, your youth.<br> You've passed it.<br> It's all you've had, and you've had it!<br> Look who's talking.<br> Just look at yourself.<br> What do you see in there?<br> I see me.<br> Alexandra Del Lago, artist and star.<br> Now you look at yourself.<br> What do you see?<br> What?<br> A nameless face, that's what you see.<br> Oh, I remember faces like yours.<br> I remember young men<br> with dreams like yours.<br> I remember their eyes,<br> I remember their voices...<br> ...I remember their smiles,<br> I remember their bodies.<br> But their names, their names have gone.<br> They're just nameless bodies.<br> Well, you remind me<br> of one in particular.<br> What was his name? Franz something.<br> Franz, Franz...<br> - Albertzart. Yes, Franz Albertzart.<br> - Are you through? Have you finished?<br> I saw Franz a few years<br> later in Monte Carlo.<br> He was with a woman of 70,<br> and his eyes were older than hers.<br> But she held him.<br> She led him by an invisible chain<br> through a string of hotels...<br> ...and casinos and bars<br> like a blind, obedient lap dog.<br> Chance Wayne is Franz Albertzart.<br> Oh, no. Look, I'm not Franz anybody.<br> Princess, I'm your next leading man.<br> Princess, now, look, you've gotta<br> open the right doors for me.<br> I know you're gonna do this for me.<br> I have been knocking on those doors<br> of success till my insides are bloody.<br> That's how I've been knocking<br> on those doors, with my bare insides.<br> You will open only one door:<br> The door to my car as my chauffeur.<br> You will wake me in the morning...<br> ...as my butler or my lover,<br> depending on what I want.<br> In a few years, you will be through<br> with your good looks...<br> ...and I will be through with you.<br> And that is the truth.<br> Can you face the truth?<br> Are you ready to be my chauffeur?<br> My next Franz Albertzart?<br> Oh, don't you know I would die first?<br> I would. I would rather die first.<br> And here he is.<br> May the good Lord protect him.<br> Our Tom.<br> I am here to answer charges against<br> my good name and character.<br> Thirty years ago,<br> the voice of God told me...<br> ...to save this sweet land<br> from pollution.<br> Well, I am here on the same<br> sacred mission tonight.<br> To save us from outsiders<br> who wanna corrupt our way of life.<br> Boss Finley!<br> Hey, Boss Finley!<br> What way of life you talking about?<br> You mean the way your daughter...<br> The way your virtuous Miss Heavenly<br> had a secret operation...<br> ...at the hands of Dr. Scudder?<br> - What are you waiting for?<br> An illegal operation,<br> performed in your hospital.<br> Aided and abetted by you.<br> - And forced on her without her consent.<br> - That is a dirty, black lie!<br> - Did God tell you how to rob us blind?<br> - Show yourself!<br> - Listen to me, folks!<br> - How to use your office for gain?<br> - Listen to me!<br> - Come on, get him out of here!<br> I have dedicated my life to God,<br> home and country.<br> My life is an open book.<br> Listen to me, folks!<br> Folks, listen to me!<br> Chance, we're leaving.<br> Right now. Together.<br> Murderer! Baby killer!<br> I'm going to send a boy<br> up for my luggage.<br> You had better come down<br> with my luggage.<br> - I am not part of your luggage.<br> - Chance.<br> Whatever I am,<br> I am not part of your luggage.<br> All right. You know what's going<br> to happen to you if you stay.<br> Goodbye.<br> Chance.<br> Chance, dear, I... Well, it's...<br> - You forget something, princess?<br> - Well, yes. Yes, I did.<br> - These, maybe?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Of course, last night<br> they were worthless...<br> ...but now, after my comeback...<br> ...you know,<br> they're worth a small jackpot.<br> - In cash.<br> - On the house.<br> Chance. Please, let me help you.<br> - Goodbye, lover.<br> - At least let me take you away.<br> - And good luck.<br> - I'll wait for you in the car.<br> Princess, each of us has his own<br> private hell to go to.<br> - Find your sister.<br> - Take it easy, Pa.<br> She'll run off with that punk.<br> - No, he's gone. Checked out.<br> - That won't stop her.<br> Will you let me handle this?<br> Mr. Finley.<br> How would you<br> answer the charges...?<br> I am shocked, shocked,<br> to find our state overrun...<br> ...by backstabbing Bolsheviki<br> and Red rabble-rousers.<br> Get the governor on the phone.<br> Are you aware it was the Finley Youth<br> Club hoodlums that started that riot?<br> What riot?<br> I'm only aware that decent Americans<br> were defending freedom of speech...<br> ...which I have yet<br> to receive the benefit of.<br> Oh, Miss Finley,<br> would you care to make a statement?<br> - Miss Finley?<br> - Hasn't enough been said already?<br> Sure, Aunt Nonnie, folks will think<br> we got something to hide.<br> Sugar? Heavenly, baby.<br> Precious, your papa's talking to you.<br> You came here<br> of your own free will...<br> ...and I hereby give you just as much<br> freedom to speak your piece, right now.<br> Take me home, Papa.<br> Good night, folks.
