                        It's a red light!<br> Hang on to your seat!<br> Charlie! I can't believe<br> you did that.<br> You scared me half to death!<br> I can't open my door.<br> How am I supposed to get out?<br> You said you wanted<br> to go to this dance.<br> I do want to go to the dance.<br> I just didn't think...<br> Hi, Charlie. Nice parking job.<br> This is gonna cost me $2.00.<br> Hi. Hello.<br> You're looking pretty. Thank you.<br> You look nice yourself.<br> Look who's here!<br> Your favorite from the Rainbow<br> Road, Miss Patsy Cline.<br> Howdy. You all havin'<br> a good time? Yeah!<br> This is a Bob Wills' tune<br> that I picked special<br> just to sing to you.<br> Deep within my<br> heart lies a melody<br> A song of old San Antone<br> Where in dreams I<br> live with a memory<br> Beneath the stars all alone<br> Well, it was there I found<br> Beside the Alamo<br> Enchantment strange<br> as the blue up above<br> On that moonlit pass<br> that only he would know<br> Still hears my<br> broken song of love<br> That's Cline?<br> Patsy Cline. Right.<br> Why don't I know her?<br> Damned if I know.<br> She sings at the Rainbow Road?<br> On weekends, yeah.<br> Lips so sweet and tender<br> like petals fallin' apart<br> Thanks for bringing me,<br> Charlie. Speak once again<br> Of my love, my own<br> Broken song Empty words I know<br> Shall live in my heart all alone<br> For that moonlit pass<br> She went to school<br> with my brother.<br> They used to say,<br> " Don't dare Patsy if<br> you don't want it done."<br> And Rose, my Rose of San Antone<br> She's got real nice tits.<br> And she's married,<br> Bozo. You lose.<br> Thank you.<br> Stop it! You're such a geek!<br> Hi. Hi.<br> I want you to get your coat.<br> I wanna drive you someplace<br> for a drink. I want us to<br> dance a while.<br> Then I want us to get to know<br> each other a lot better.<br> You want a lot, don't you?<br> Yeah, I do, baby.<br> Well, people in hell want<br> ice water. That don't<br> mean they get it.<br> Patsy, you never did.<br> I did so. I looked him right<br> in the eye and said...<br> "People in hell want ice water.<br> That don't mean they get it."<br> Who was he? Some clown<br> with hot britches.<br> Lord, I do get tired of men<br> sometimes, always pawin'<br> and snortin' around.<br> They after you all the<br> time when you were my age?<br> I don't know.<br> Were they, Mama?<br> Tell me. Stop it.<br> Quit, Patsy.<br> Back when I was in high school<br> and had a better shape...<br> there was this boy<br> named Teddy Welloff.<br> Had gray eyes with<br> coal black eyelashes.<br> This is way before<br> I met your daddy.<br> May he rot in hell. Don't speak<br> like that about Daddy.<br> Anyway, at lunch we'd all<br> go in the cloakroom to<br> get our dinner buckets.<br> Every day this Teddy<br> Welloff used to brush his<br> front up against me...<br> when I was bent over.<br> That's the truth.<br> Wait, there's more.<br> One day, I took my<br> ink pen with me.<br> That thing had a real<br> sharp point on it.<br> I never looked at him<br> the rest of the day...<br> but there was egg salad sandwich<br> all over that cloakroom.<br> That boy walked funny for a week.<br> I'm gonna pee my pants.<br> You gonna come in for a while?<br> Is Gerald still up?<br> It looks like it.<br> No, honey, I better go<br> on home. You chicken!<br> I'll be over for Sunday dinner.<br> Bye.<br> Nightynight.<br> Good night, baby.<br> I'm home.<br> How'd it go?<br> Well, I only made $25.<br> I did real good I<br> think. That's nice.<br> I sang "San Antonio Rose."<br> I've been gone all evening.<br> Don't you want to talk to me?<br> Say "Kiss my ass" or something?<br> Sorry, honey.<br> How'd it go tonight?<br> You already asked me that.<br> Ask me something else?<br> Come on, let's have<br> a conversation.<br> Notice anything different?<br> I finished the riggin'.<br> Patsy, why are you always<br> pushing at me so hard?<br> I don't know.<br> Just hoping for a fight,<br> or a laugh or something.<br> I don't want to fight<br> with you. I'm not mad.<br> I can't stand it. Makes me want<br> to scream and claw my face.<br> What should I do?<br> You didn't ask me how to<br> get into this marriage.<br> I don't think you ought to<br> ask me how to get out of it.<br> Is he mean to you? No.<br> Does he drink? Gamble?<br> Does he chase the women?<br> Then what?<br> Come on, girl. Speak the<br> truth and shame the devil.<br> God as my witness, I don't know!<br> I laid in bed and thought,<br> " Shit! What if I was blind<br> or didn't have my legs?"<br> You watch that mouth.<br> Mom, I'm home.<br> I'm starvin'.<br> There's lunch made,<br> but don't spoil your dinner.<br> Say hello to your sister before<br> you worry about your belly.<br> I don't know, Mama.<br> My life ain't so bad.<br> I got a decent house,<br> a man who loves me.<br> I've even sung on<br> television four times.<br> Tell me. Why do I have to<br> force myself to get out<br> of bed every mornin'?<br> You always was hard to<br> keep satisfied, even when<br> you was little.<br> I'm not talking about<br> when I was three.<br> I'm asking you what<br> I should do now.<br> Maybe you should scream and claw<br> your face. See if that'll help.<br> I said blue moon of<br> Kentucky keep on ashinin'<br> Shine on the one that's<br> gone and left me blue<br> Blue moon of Kentucky<br> keep on ashinin'<br> Shine on the one that's<br> gone and left me blue<br> It was on one moonlit night<br> Stars shining bright<br> Whispered on high<br> Love said goodbye<br> I said blue moon of<br> Kentucky keep on ashinin'<br> Shine on the one that's<br> gone and left me blue<br> Thank you. Goddamn<br> woman, you're good!<br> That bitch can sing!<br> I don't know if you<br> remember me. Take a walk.<br> I really like the way you sing.<br> What were you doing while I sang?<br> You think that's funny?<br> I was listening.<br> I don't like the way you<br> listen. Take a walk.<br> Hi.<br> Oh, merciful God.<br> I want to explain.<br> It's the creature<br> that wouldn't die.<br> I came over here to<br> explain. He won't go away.<br> To apologize for messin' you up.<br> I was just enjoying your singin'.<br> Now that I get a good<br> look at Patsy Cline,<br> she don't look so hot.<br> I don't care if you have<br> sung on some halfassed<br> television program.<br> You don't sing that good.<br> You ever listen to a Kitty<br> Wells record real close?<br> You'd go home and slit<br> your goddamn throat.<br> I've grown so used<br> to that man somehow<br> And I'm nobody's sugar baby now<br> 'Cause I'm lonesome<br> I got the lovesick blues<br> We're gonna take a<br> break. Thank you.<br> Seven and seven.<br> Last week at the high<br> school you said you<br> wanted to buy me a drink.<br> I want a seven and seven.<br> A seventyseven.<br> Well, you've got the<br> advantage on me.<br> You know my name,<br> but I don't know yours.<br> Charlie.<br> Charlie Dick.<br> Dick?<br> Charlie Dick?<br> That's right.<br> What do you want<br> out of me, Charlie?<br> You didn't follow me out<br> to Rainbow Road because<br> you're a fool for music.<br> Hell no. I want to get<br> to know you better.<br> Okay. What does that mean?<br> It means I want to get<br> to know you better.<br> I figure when you say you want<br> to get to know me better...<br> what you mean is you want<br> a tenminute screw in the<br> backseat of your car.<br> Son of a bitch.<br> You must think that thing<br> you got between your legs<br> is lined with gold.<br> I can get tail anytime.<br> I don't have to crawl<br> after a mean woman who's<br> got a cob crossways.<br> If I just want to bump uglies<br> with somebody, I got plenty<br> of places to go.<br> "Bump uglies"? That's right.<br> My Lord, what a charming<br> expression.<br> I just grew up.<br> My daddy dumped us<br> when I was about 16.<br> I haven't seen him since.<br> But Mom and I did okay.<br> She couldn't work too much,<br> so I've worked pretty<br> steady since I was 15.<br> You made a livin' for<br> the whole family?<br> No. Mama sewed for people.<br> But basically I did.<br> I want to ask you something.<br> What?<br> You know all those things<br> you said you want?<br> Yeah.<br> Answer me quick.<br> Which you want most?<br> All of it. I want it all.<br> And I want to make it right.<br> I do.<br> Since I've been 11 or 12 years<br> old, I've had my life mapped out.<br> I haven't pushed hard these<br> last years, but I'm gonna<br> start next year.<br> I'm starting next year,<br> too, by God. That's the<br> time to start for me.<br> I'm serious. I'm gonna<br> be a singer.<br> I'm gonna make some<br> money, have some kids...<br> and then I'm gonna stop singing<br> and raise those kids right.<br> Have a big house with<br> yellow roses all around it.<br> You think that's silly? No.<br> I figure somebody<br> ought to be happy.<br> Hell. It might as<br> well be me. Right?<br> Right.<br> I've never met a woman like you.<br> I can talk to you.<br> You know what that<br> means to a man?<br> Do you?<br> I don't know.<br> Let's go dancin'.<br> Where? Right out here. Come on.<br> In the parking lot? Yep.<br> Are you kiddin'?<br> I don't do this. You don't?<br> No. But I'm doin' it.<br> No, Charlie, don't leave me.<br> I was starving,<br> and I didn't even know.<br> Hey, Mama!<br> Mama, come here.<br> What are you doing here<br> on Sunday morning?<br> Mama, I feel so good!<br> Don't give me that dark<br> look. I feel so damn good!<br> What's them suitcases?<br> I left him.<br> I don't care!<br> There's a man. No,<br> I'm doing this for me.<br> There's a man. Mama! Honey baby!<br> Come on, honey.<br> Be happy for me.<br> Does Gerald know?<br> I stopped by on my way<br> over here and told him.<br> You know what he said? What?<br> "Patsy, if your considered<br> opinion is that you really<br> want a divorce...<br> I'll not stand in your way."<br> There's a man. You're too happy.<br> Yes, there is.<br> I don't know. There might be.<br> I don't know, but oh,<br> sweet Jesus, I just feel so good.<br> Oh, my darling, you're crying<br> Boohoohoohoo<br> There's no use in denying<br> I've cried for you<br> It was your favorite pastime<br> Making me blue<br> Last week was the last time<br> I cried for you<br> Seven hankies blue<br> I filled with my tears<br> Seven letters too<br> I filled with my fears<br> Guess it never pays<br> To make your lover blue<br> Seven lonely days<br> I cried and I cried for you<br> Oh, my darling, you're crying<br> Boohoohoohoo<br> Your cheating heart<br> Will make you weep<br> You'll cry and cry<br> And try to sleep<br> But sleep won't come<br> The whole night through<br> Your cheating heart<br> Will tell on you<br> When tears come down<br> Like falling rain<br> You'll toss around<br> Nice day.<br> Great day.<br> Do you want to top me<br> all the time? Just say,<br> "Yes, it's a nice day."<br> Yes, it's a nice day.<br> This water is cold.<br> We used to come swimmin'<br> here up till November.<br> I'm telling you, this water's<br> got ice cubes in it.<br> A guy in my class says he saw an<br> with his mouth open,<br> showing white.<br> I ain't afraid of snakes.<br> Take a swim, big talk. Go ahead.<br> I'll pay you. How much will<br> it take for you to jump in?<br> What? I'm serious. How much?<br> Three hundred.<br> You'd really do it?<br> You got the cash? I love it!<br> Man, I wish I had $300.<br> You don't have it?<br> I ain't jumping in for nothin'.<br> I'll save you.<br> You want to have other<br> nice days like today?<br> Sure.<br> I mean lots of them. Sure.<br> No, I mean lots of them.<br> Good times all the<br> time, Sunday to Sunday.<br> What?<br> Charlie?<br> Wanna get married?<br> I dare you!<br> Yes!<br> You telling me yes?

Doesn't<br> she look beautiful?<br> Are you ready?<br> We're ready.<br> Byebye.<br> If you find yourself<br> wondering what to do in<br> the dark, give me a call.<br> I think I can manage.<br> I'll see you at work.<br> On Monday morning.<br> Byebye, Mama.<br> I love you, sugar.<br> You take care of yourself.<br> You look so pretty today. Bye.<br> What the hell you been<br> doing in there? Come here.<br> It's kind of scary,<br> isn't it? What do you mean?<br> You go out and buy a new dress...<br> stand in front of a<br> preacher, say a few words...<br> suddenly everything's changed.<br> I just want it to work out,<br> Charlie. I want everything<br> to be right.<br> Well, come here.<br> Wait.<br> This is my wedding night.<br> I want the words.<br> Say the words.<br> I love you.<br> Say it again.<br> I love you, goddamn it!<br> That's so nice.<br> I want this to work out, too.<br> I'm sure as hell gonna try.<br> Yeah? Yeah.<br> Here. You look like you<br> need this more than me.<br> God bless you, mister.<br> Big night, huh?<br> Real big.<br> Tell me. How was the<br> honeymoon? Nice?<br> Hell, yeah. It was wonderful.<br> Two days at a cutrate<br> motel. It was great.<br> Real uptown stuff.<br> Pasty didn't like it?<br> Patsy didn't say a word.<br> She wouldn't. I didn't like it.<br> I didn't like it. Jesus,<br> you're in a mood.<br> I've got $12 to my name.<br> Twelve dollars until payday.<br> The money ain't so bad here.<br> Or so good.<br> What do you want?<br> Want to be like that old<br> fart, Lawrence?<br> Wear a suit, run the place?<br> Hell, no.<br> I'd just like somethin'<br> different maybe. Do something<br> a little better.<br> I'd like to get my<br> own place maybe.<br> I don't care,<br> I ain't gonna do it.<br> The idea of you asking me to<br> go on television and lie.<br> I am not asking you to lie.<br> All you've got to do is say,<br> "Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley.<br> I brought my friend Patsy<br> Cline. I'm her talent scout."<br> That's not a lie.<br> You are my friend.<br> I ain't gonna do it,<br> so stop flapping your jaws at me.<br> That man from the show told<br> you that talent scouts<br> can't be a relative.<br> Is that why you give me<br> that housecoat of yours<br> with the puff sleeves?<br> I give you that housecoat<br> 'cause you said you liked it.<br> Well, I won't lie on television.<br> Goddamn it! I'm not<br> asking you to lie.<br> Just don't spill your<br> guts is all I'm askin'.<br> Stop that dirty talk now.<br> Mama, think of what it could mean<br> to sing on national television.<br> All you gotta do is just say...<br> "Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley.<br> I've brought my friend Patsy<br> Cline.

Why are you<br> so polite anymore?<br> Can't you just talk normal?<br> I feel like I'm talkin' to<br> Eleanor Roosevelt.<br> I gotta go, Charlie.<br> The baby's cryin'.<br> I'll talk to you, okay? Yeah,<br> okay, if Julie's cryin'.<br> Patsy.<br> You awake?<br> Wake up, baby.<br> Shh. Put something on.<br> I want to take you someplace.<br> What's the matter?<br> What are you doing here?<br> It's important.

I always will."<br> I told you before you left,<br> I'm not holding any grudges.<br> I need something from you.<br> I need you to look me<br> in the face and say...<br> "You screw up a lot,<br> but I still love you,<br> Charlie. I always will."<br> You screw up a lot,<br> Charlie, but I still love<br> you and I always will.<br> Say it again.<br> You screw up a lot,<br> but I still love you,<br> Charlie. I always will.<br> I'll have a blue Christmas<br> Without you<br> I'll be so blue<br> Thinking about you<br> Decorations of red<br> On a green Christmas tree<br> Start the movie!<br> Won't mean a thing, dear, if...<br> What are they doin'?<br> What the hell's goin' on?<br> I cannot believe this!<br> Honey, your mama's life is not<br> workin' out.

Is that right?<br> You wrote me a letter<br> about a year ago.<br> But I had a baby and haven't<br> been doin' much singing.<br> You don't have to sell me.<br> I think you're maybe the best<br> country singer in the world.<br> Come in here.<br> Let's you and I talk.<br> I always did like a man who knew<br> how to start a conversation good.<br> I swear, I can make us<br> both a lot of money.<br> You won't be sorry.<br> You know why not? Why?<br> Because when the song is<br> right and I feel it...<br> I can tell from looking<br> at people's faces that<br> I've reached inside them.<br> You got any idea what<br> that feels like?<br> You want to be Kitty Wells?<br> Hell no! I want to<br> be Hank Williams.<br> All right. Sit down,<br> listen to me.<br> I got a story to tell you.<br> I heard you sing one night<br> in a dump in Virginia.<br> Twelve tables,<br> watereddown drinks...<br> dance floor the size<br> of that coffee table.<br> You were good.<br> The crowd liked ya.<br> Ate up that yodelin'<br> and growlin' stuff.<br> Then you let go on "Walkin'<br> the Floor Over You."<br> But you did it slow<br> like a ballad.<br> I'm tellin' you, the hair on<br> the back of my neck stood up.<br> There I was in this<br> dive in Virginia...<br> and I was listening to<br> something real special.<br> Yeah.<br> You get my drift?<br> I'll make it simple.<br> You got a voice that was<br> made to sing love songs.<br> If I work with you,<br> we take advantage of that fact.<br> I don't wanna talk about<br> it anymore. I got starving<br> kids waiting in the car.<br> It's too late. It's all set up.<br> I don't give a damn!<br> I don't want four big male<br> singers drowning me out.<br> They're booked and<br> will be there at 2:00.<br> If they're there,<br> I'm not showing up.<br> Musicians are booked.<br> Owen Bradley's gonna be<br> there.

There it is.<br> See that white one<br> with the columns?<br> Ain't it the truth?<br> I fell in love with it<br> the minute I saw it.<br> I'd like a pale,<br> pale blue carpet.<br> Maybe a couple divans,<br> make a conversation area.<br> Honey?<br> Look at this.<br> We got a dishwasher.<br> And an oven built<br> right into the wall.<br> I want to check a roast,<br> all I have to do is open<br> the door like this.<br> No more bending over.<br> The Queen of Sheba.<br> Say you already bought<br> it? I paid down on it.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I wanted to surprise you.<br> You surprised me.<br> The best thing we can do<br> with our money is put it<br> in bricks and mortar.<br> That show went on<br> forever last night...<br> and every minute of it<br> shows in my face today.<br> I'm glad we saved "Crazy"<br> till the end. I think it<br> made a great encore.<br> You love Charlie?<br> What?<br> You love him?<br> Oh, come on. I couldn't<br> get along without Charlie.<br> How's that song go?<br> " He may have been a headache,<br> but he never was a bore."<br> That's Charlie.<br> Is that an answer?<br> I think Charlie and I<br> deserve each other.<br> Looks like Charlie might be<br> throwing you a little party.<br> Sure does. Take care.<br> I'll see you at the<br> session. All right.<br> Try and get a little sleep<br> between now and Friday.<br> Nightynight. Good night.<br> Miss Patsy Cline! In person!<br> My baby's home!<br> We're having a party.<br> I see.<br> Did you see my new car?<br> I bought an old clunker to<br> drive in the demo derby.<br> How are you?<br> You know most everybody.<br> This is Cindy.<br> John and Sarah from work.<br> That there's...<br> I don't know who that is.<br> This is Skip. He sold me that<br> car. I'm glad to meet you.<br> Nice to meet you. Think I'll<br> get myself a beer.<br> How'd it go tonight? All right.<br> This your date, Otis?<br> Lucky man. Yeah, goddamn it.<br> Help yourself to food in there.<br> Bought a bunch of Chinese.<br> Let's us dance one.<br> Come on. Don't be such<br> an old wet blanket.<br> Oh! No fair. We gotta<br> wait for the next one.<br> I'm going to bed. I'm so tired.<br> That girl I was dancing with goes<br> with that guy from the derby.<br> Obviously you got me mixed up<br> with someone who gives a shit.<br> Come on. There you go.<br> That's Goldilocks and the<br> Three Bears. Take your book.<br> Oh, how's my big boy?<br> You are the most<br> beautiful little boy.<br> Here we go.<br> Fell right on your<br> butt. Take your bottle.<br> Hey, kiddo.<br> Hope you're rested.<br> Otis wants us to go out after<br> the demo derby tonight.<br> Darling, I'm so tired,<br> I feel like I'm<br> walking on stumps.<br> I gotta sing there tonight.<br> I don't feel like walking<br> off the stage and taking<br> a busman's holiday.<br> What's a busman's holiday?<br> A guy drives a bus,<br> he doesn't want to take a<br> bus ride for his vacation.<br> Hell. It's too hard to explain.<br> I understood it.<br> You getting awful goddamn<br> fancy all of a sudden.<br> Yeah?<br> Here comes another<br> paycheck for Charlie.<br> Crazy<br> Crazy for feelin'<br> So lonely<br> I'm crazy<br> Crazy for feelin' so blue<br> You didn't finish that.<br> "And the cow jumped...<br> Over the moon.<br> Three little bears<br> sittin' in their chairs."<br> Better start gettin' ready.<br> We got time. Not that much.<br> "And a pair of mittens."<br> You're not dressed yet.<br> I get dressed faster than you.<br> No, you don't. White?<br> What? White.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Want to see if you say "black."<br> "A quiet old lady who<br> was whispering 'Hush."'<br> Blue moon of Kentucky<br> Keep on ashinin'<br> Shine on the one that's<br> gone and left me blue<br> Love said goodbye I said<br> Blue moon of Kentucky<br> Keep on ashinin'<br> Shinin' bright<br> Whisperin' on high till<br> lovers said goodbye<br> I said blue moon<br> Come on, baby, treat me right.<br> I'm gonna get you!<br> Baby, baby. Be good to me.<br> What happened? That's not<br> supposed to happen.<br> I was lookin' for you.<br> I ain't been hidin' nowhere.<br> Wanna dance? Yeah, later.<br> You should've seen Charlie.<br> His clunker is still burnin'.<br> Why don't you take a busman's<br> holiday? Go sing another song.<br> Sit down.<br> Baby, let's dance.<br> I'm gettin' thirsty.<br> I don't know about you, Otis.<br> I'll be right back.<br> You want to leave?<br> Hey, you.<br> Bitch!<br> What the hell you think you're<br> doing? Same question back to you.<br> I was just talkin' to her. Me,<br> too. I'm just talkin' to them.<br> How old is she anyhow?<br> She said she's 24.<br> Ask her how old she is<br> counting the years she<br> went barefoot on the farm.<br> You got a mean mouth.<br> I'd like to pull your tongue<br> with a pair of pliers.<br> I'm takin' a pee.<br> I'm warnin' you. You set your<br> ass down at my table. You hear?<br> Don't you warn me!<br> You spend the evening rubbing<br> up against some tramp,<br> I'll do whatever I please.<br> You will, will you? I'll walk out<br> with the first guy.<br> I'd like to see you<br> try. You just watch me.<br> This is it right over here.<br> I get Patsy Cline on my<br> cycle, all she wants is<br> coffee and a ride home.<br> You're a real gent. Just my luck.<br> Thanks a lot. No problem.<br> Well, the slut's home.<br> Came home to see the pig.<br> Where's that guy?<br> Had him let me off<br> about a block away.<br> We just talked. You're a whore.<br> Let's not call each other<br> names. It don't do no good.<br> We still gotta wake up tomorrow,<br> and look each other in the face.<br> I ain't having no more<br> nights when my wife goes<br> off with another man.<br> Don't tell me what you<br> will or will not have.<br> I looked at you tonight and<br> thought, "God help you, Patsy.<br> No matter how hard you try<br> to make things right...<br> goodtime Charlie keeps<br> dragging you back down!"<br> Don't whine about me!<br> Where are you when the kids<br> want oatmeal in the morning?<br> Where are you when Julie pukes<br> in bed? You sure ain't here!<br> You lie!<br> You never changed a shitty<br> diaper in your life...<br> between Mama, Madrine and me!<br> That's right, I'm not here!<br> I'm singing in every shit house<br> between here and Kansas City...<br> so you can wear $30 silk shirts!<br> Yeah? Take the goddamn thing!<br> Take it!<br> You lay down for that<br> guy tonight? Don't ask.<br> I'm askin', slut.<br> Yes, I did! I did!<br> It was great. It was wonderful.<br> It was better than it's been<br> with you.<br> We're gonna get married,<br> Mr. Motorcycle man and me.<br> Come here. Stand up!<br> Stop it! Stop!<br> Goddamn it!<br> Shut up!<br> Mama?<br> Oh, God, baby, go back to bed.<br> Regarding that family<br> disturbance, unit 17 has<br> that in hand.<br> Trade me an eye for one<br> of them cigarettes?<br> What are you in here for?<br> Had an argument with my wife.<br> I fell asleep in a doorway.<br> Put them there. You can have<br> one whenever you want it.<br> Thank you. I appreciate it.<br> You look like you got the<br> whole world on your shoulders.<br> You give me a cigarette,<br> these questions go with<br> it, you can have it back.<br> I just thought we'd<br> pass the time.<br> Go ahead and take it.<br> You only got one.<br> It's all right.<br> I smoke too much anyway.<br> Thank you.<br> Sleep light, don't you?<br> Just like my old man.<br> He smoked Camels, too.<br> He started when he<br> was nine years old.<br> There he was, nine years<br> old, in the fourth grade...<br> still wearing knickers.<br> Get up in the morning,<br> he'd have a cup of coffee<br> and a cigarette...<br> right at the breakfast<br> table, big as you please.<br> He was a pisscutter,<br> my old man was.<br> He always could make me laugh.<br> I never knew who my daddy was.<br> I don't think Mama did either.<br> My daddy's six feet tall...<br> when six feet tall was big.<br> Had this real high voice.<br> Could walk halfway around<br> the block on his hands.<br> One morning I was getting<br> ready for school.<br> My daddy stayed home from<br> work, he was at the kitchen<br> table smoking Camels...<br> one right after the other,<br> he was eatin' them.<br> I went to get corn flakes<br> out of the cupboard...<br> and heard this noise.<br> I thought the whole<br> house was falling down.<br> I turned around, he'd shot<br> hisself in the head.<br> Sweet Jesus!<br> I sat on my bed for five days.<br> Wouldn't talk to nobody.<br> Wouldn't go to his funeral.<br> On the fifth day, I got up,<br> went out the door.<br> And I never looked back.<br> Just keep on movin'.<br> Know what I mean?<br> Just keep on movin'.<br> I can't seem to find anything in<br> my life to hold on to anymore.<br> It's like everything is<br> falling down around me.<br> I say to myself, " I don't have<br> to lead that trashy dog's life...<br> that my daddy led my mama.<br> I can make things different.<br> I can make it right."<br> And look at me. Here I am,<br> my face busted up.<br> Calling the cops in the<br> middle of the night.<br> And my kid saw it all!<br> Mama, I don't know<br> what to do anymore.<br> I don't know whether<br> to divorce him or not.<br> All I know is I can't<br> keep him outta the house<br> like this forever.<br> This is your baby.<br> You have to rock it.<br> Hell! I'm not asking for your<br> goddamn eyeteeth! I was asking<br> for your opinion.<br> You're talking to your<br> mama. You keep a civil<br> tongue in your head.<br> Yeah?<br> Oh, no, Randy, not a big show!<br> All right.<br> Christ on the cross!<br> I don't believe it.<br> I got recording sessions Friday.<br> Now I gotta do a benefit for that<br> disc jockey that died last month.<br> Tell him you're wore out.<br> I'm sorry I snapped at you.<br> If that's the worst thing<br> that ever happens to me.<br> You still like me?<br> Now and then.<br> You love me?<br> Sometimes.<br> Tell me what to do with my life.<br> I've got your picture<br> That you gave to me<br> And it's signed "With love"<br> Just like it used to be<br> Hey! Whoa! Charlie.<br> Where are you goin'?<br> I'm gonna talk to my<br> wife. Hold on a second.<br> What do you want, Charlie?<br> I want to talk to you.<br> It's all right.<br> Everybody, take five.<br> Kill Patsy's mike.<br> God, Charlie, don't.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I did wrong.<br> I will never raise a hand<br> to you again. I swear it.<br> I know you're thinkin'<br> of leavin' me.<br> I swear to God, I don't think<br> I could take it.<br> I don't know.<br> Can't we try and<br> make it right again?<br> If you want a definite<br> answer right this minute,<br> the answer is no.<br> I don't know if I can<br> live with you anymore.<br> Sweet dreams<br> Of you<br> Every night<br> I go through<br> Why can't I forget you<br> And start my life anew<br> Instead of having sweet dreams<br> About you<br> You don't love me<br> It's plain<br> I should know<br> I'll never wear your ring<br> I should hate you<br> The whole night through<br> Instead of having sweet dreams<br> About you<br> Sweet dreams<br> Of you<br> Things I know<br> Can't come true<br> Why can't I forget the past<br> Start loving someone new<br> Instead of having<br> Sweet dreams<br> About you<br> Thank you.<br> Tony, I gotta take a pee!<br> Pretty Boy Floyd!<br> Get this boy one.<br> He's been on bread and water.<br> Give me a drink.<br> I've been in the jail.<br> You drink any more, you'll wish<br> you was dead when you wake up.<br> Where was it you left<br> your ball and chain?<br> In my private room in<br> prison. Take a walk.<br> Charlie, finish this and<br> let's get outta here,<br> find us a couple of girlies.<br> That's one thing I do not<br> need. I got that already.<br> Can everybody hear me?<br> I got me a wife.<br> She is hard to handle and as<br> contrary as a hog on ice.<br> That ain't half of it.<br> You guys ain't got no<br> idea what it's like...<br> to be rubbing up against<br> something that dangerous.<br> That's what I like<br> about the South<br> Mama, hi!<br> We're still at the<br> airport. The weather bad?<br> Yeah. We've spent the<br> whole damn night here...<br> but the first spot of good<br> weather we'll take off.<br> How are my babies?<br> Just fine. Charlie came<br> by the house with two<br> quarts of ice cream.<br> He did? He said he<br> missed seeing them.<br> I knew he couldn't stay away.<br> He hadn't had a thing<br> to drink. Good as gold.<br> Hell, Charlie's always<br> good. Except when he isn't.<br> You just hurry home.<br> Give those babies sugar<br> for me. Of course.<br> Let's go! Hot dog! This beats<br> the hell out of drivin'!<br> Let's get this show on the road.<br> Looks like we might be<br> in for a little fun.<br> A little turbulence.<br> Right tank's empty.<br> Switching over.<br> Oh, boy! What the<br> hell's goin' on?<br> What's the matter with this?<br> Gotta drop the nose. Hold on.<br> Kick it over.<br> Come on, baby. Come on!<br> Catch on!<br> Come on, baby.<br> It started. Oh, Lord, thank you!<br> Attaboy, Randy.<br> I almost peed my pants.<br> I did pee in mine.<br> My God!<br> You can't work and take<br> care of two babies.<br> Look at me.<br> I'll take the kids<br> with me for a while.<br> I'll be good to them.<br> I know it.<br> I know it.<br>
