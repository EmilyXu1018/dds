                        Why Emmet Ray?<br> Because he was interesting.<br> To me, Emmet Ray was<br> a fascinating character.<br> I was a huge fan of his<br> when I was younger.<br> I thought he was<br> an absolutely great guitar player...<br> and he was funny.<br> You know, or...<br> if funny's the wrong word,<br> then sort of pathetic in a way.<br> He was flamboyant<br> and he was, you know...<br> boorish and obnoxious.<br> Well, the problem is that there's<br> just so little known about him.<br> But we do know that<br> he was a great guitar player.<br> I'd say he was probably the second<br> greatest guitar player in the world.<br> Django Reinhardt was the best...<br> and believe me,<br> Emmet idolized Django.<br> He was in awe of him.<br> There's a story that says when he<br> saw him playing in France, he fainted.<br> He saw Django again at a restaurant<br> in Germany, and he fainted again.<br> It seems that every time...<br> Django would always make him faint<br> or he'd make him cry.<br> Well, his relationship with Hattie<br> is mostly what's known about him.<br> There are a few Emmet Ray<br> stories before that...<br> but I have no idea whether<br> they're true or not.<br> First time anybody seemed<br> to have heard of him was in Chicago.<br> It was at this roadside joint.<br> Good to see you tonight.<br> - Where the hell is he?<br> - I don't know.<br> You gotta get him, Dan.<br> He's layin' drunk somewhere.<br> - He's probably in a poolroom.<br> - Every night it's somethin' else.<br> He's late. He gets drunk.<br> He falls off the bandstand.<br> - I told you not to hire this guy.<br> - What time does Emmet Ray go on?<br> Look at the crowd.<br> Think they're here to see me?<br> Relax. I'll find him.<br> I'm gonna have to<br> hold the show again.<br> I'll kill this guy.<br> I don't care what kind of artist he is.<br> You take care of business.<br> I'll find him. Just relax.<br> Hey, good to see you again.<br> That's 50 more you owe me.<br> I'm not goin' out of town.<br> Another one?<br> I think you got some visitors.<br> I'll be back.<br> - What'd we get?<br> - Here's your end.<br> This is what you bring me, $30?<br> It's almost midnight. $30?<br> That's half, Emmet.<br> That's all we made.<br> I can't live on that.<br> I got car payments, I got new shirts.<br> I'm sorry. Business was slow.<br> It's a Jewish holiday.<br> And last night it was rainin', and<br> the night before you got food poisonin'.<br> - Because I drank that booze you made.<br> - Listen, Emmet.<br> I don't know how to tell you this,<br> but while I was in bed...<br> with one of the johns you sent me,<br> he got very excited, and he...<br> got a heart attack,<br> and he dropped dead.<br> - Which one?<br> - The salesman from Detroit.<br> - What did you do?<br> - I took my clothes and I left.<br> So there's nothin'<br> to trace back to us?<br> Then I was thinking that maybe<br> he had one of your business cards.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - A pimp doesn't need business cards!<br> You're always tryin'<br> to be too fancy.<br> Emmet, let's go.<br> You're supposed to be on stage.<br> Every night you're either late,<br> drunk, or you don't show up.<br> What is it with you?<br> How are you doin'?<br> I'm on right now.<br> Thanks for comin'.<br> Put their tab on my bill.<br> I don't wanna embarrass you in front of<br> friends, but boss said no more advances.<br> Don't give me a song and dance.<br> Just put their tab on my bill.<br> Hi, guys.<br> It's gonna be a lot of cats there.<br> We always have fun at Don's.<br> - Donald.<br> - Well, Donald.<br> - Watch out over there.<br> - I got this, man.<br> You take care of that.<br> And don't forget to pass.<br> - They caught him a couple of times.<br> - Caught what?<br> Mind your business.<br> Watch the road.<br> What you got there, man?<br> Is that a.45?<br> .45 what?<br> Wait, wait.<br> Better put that shit away.<br> Hey, you wanna go to the dump,<br> shoot some rats? Huh?<br> - Shoot some what?<br> - Rats.<br> I do it all the time.<br> It's a lot of fun.<br> - A hepcat shootin' rats.<br> - I don't think you need no more of this.<br> There should be no other guns<br> in this car besides my gun.<br> Man, where'd you learn<br> to play that thing like that?<br> - I never heard guitar sound so good.<br> - Yeah, I'm the greatest in the world.<br> Well, you know,<br> in France there's Django.<br> Django? You know, he's comin'<br> to America in the summer to record.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah. Ever meet him?<br> I could've once, in Europe.<br> You know, really,<br> our styles are just different.<br> Nate Drummond prefers me.<br> He says I'm miraculous.<br> You're welcome to come here anytime.<br> You know, we play here all the time.<br> - And I make great chili.<br> - Well, thank you.<br> Say, man, we're about to hit it.<br> Can we drop you somewhere?<br> - I like the air. I'll walk.<br> - You sure about that?<br> Yeah. Thank you.<br> Well, I heard stories<br> that he was a kleptomaniac.<br> I heard that once he stole<br> an alarm clock from Hoagy Carmichael...<br> and Hoagy overslept<br> and he missed a record date.<br> What do you think?<br> The only other story that I heard,<br> other than Hattie, was this moon idea.<br> He had this idea<br> about this crescent moon.<br> That he wanted to make an entrance<br> on this big crescent moon.<br> Well, the story is that<br> it came to him, apparently...<br> I guess, in a dream...<br> that he'd build this moon thing<br> with his own money.<br> Because he thought that<br> a star of his great stature...<br> ought to be able to make<br> a real big entrance with a moon.<br> Just try to visualize it.<br> Just try to visualize it.<br> You're lookin' up, and there it is.<br> Gold, beautiful moon.<br> I'm comin' down, and you guys<br> are playin'. What do you think?<br> It's a stupid idea. I told you.<br> Would you let me take this shot?<br> I didn't ask your opinion.<br> I'm just tellin' you how it's gonna go.<br> And then the jacket<br> would match the moon...<br> against a black<br> velvet background.<br> - What do you think?<br> - It sounds okay to me.<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's fancy.<br> I'm considered<br> the best guitar player...<br> maybe that ever lived.<br> Certainly in this country.<br> There's this...<br> There's a gypsy in France...<br> and he's the most<br> beautiful thing I ever heard.<br> Tonight's the night.<br> Emmet, just as long as you're happy.<br> That's the most important thing.<br> It's really beautiful.<br> It is really beautiful.<br> It's like jewelry.<br> Hey, I wanna just be alone with<br> the moon for a minute, all right?<br> You wanna be alone<br> with the moon? Okay.<br> Emmet, you know what you are?<br> You're a genius.<br> She's a knockout, ain't she?<br> Hope it's safe.<br> Of course it's safe.<br> Why wouldn't it be safe?<br> It's a hell of a drop.<br> A man can break his neck.<br> Really?<br> And it starts to build and build<br> in Emmet's mind.<br> And by show time...<br> he's numb with fear,<br> he's petrified.<br> And the audience is out there<br> waiting for him...<br> and he's backstage, meanwhile,<br> drinking and drinking.<br> When he's ready to go on,<br> he's stiff as a board.<br> - Snazzy!<br> - Did you buy that off the rack?<br> Look. The Big Dipper.<br> - Emmet, your gun is bulging.<br> - Do you think?<br> What the hell you<br> need it on stage for?<br> I don't feel right<br> without it.<br> I'll give it back to you<br> as soon as you're done.<br> Show time!<br> - You all right?<br> - Emmet, be careful.<br> You're on?<br> Need a hand?<br> Let's do it.<br> Sooner or later,<br> everybody's dreams go up in smoke.<br> What about my dreams?<br> I can't settle down, Ann.<br> - We don't have to marry.<br> - I can't.<br> I gotta be free.<br> I'm an artist.<br> I thought you liked me.<br> We have fun.<br> I took you to the dump.<br> I let you shoot my gun at some rats.<br> Shootin' rats at the dump<br> is not my idea of a good time.<br> Why not?<br> We brought sandwiches.<br> And sittin' at the railroads watchin'<br> trains, that's pretty strange too.<br> See? That's what I mean.<br> What I like to do, what you like to do,<br> ain't the same thing.<br> That's not it, Emmet.<br> It's that you keep<br> your feelings locked up...<br> and you can't feel nothin'<br> for anybody else.<br> You say that<br> like it's a bad thing.<br> Some terrible things happen<br> to people in love. I know. I've seen it.<br> I enjoy the company of women.<br> I love 'em.<br> It's just that<br> I don't need 'em.<br> I guess, you know, that's the way it is<br> when you're a true artist.<br> It doesn't mean<br> we can't fool around.<br> Oh, right.<br> Or shoot rats or watch trains.<br> I never met anybody that<br> keeps their feelings so locked up.<br> I let my feelin's<br> come out in my music.<br> Maybe if you let your feelings out in<br> real life, your music would be better.<br> Don't talk.<br> Emmet met Hattie in New Jersey.<br> The band was playing a resort hotel.<br> On a day off, Emmet...<br> and his drummer,<br> Bill Shields...<br> were doing their<br> version of charm.<br> They were trying to pick up girls<br> on the boardwalk.<br> This place is heaven on earth.<br> Cotton candy, eight o'clock.<br> Watch me work.<br> Mary! Right?<br> Why don't you drop dead, jerk?<br> I thought you were someone I knew.<br> Sometimes I hit with a... Mary!<br> Martina. Mary Ann.<br> Marge. Kate?<br> Excuse me, miss.<br> I'm a photography buff myself.<br> I was thinkin' maybe we could<br> get my friend to take a picture of us.<br> Wait a minute. Time out.<br> - Do you see this?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Did you see? She looked<br> right at me. She smiled.<br> - That was a smile.<br> - And she was lookin' right at me.<br> Which one you want?<br> The little one<br> with the silly hat.<br> She's more my size.<br> I'll flip you.<br> - I saw her first!<br> - All right!<br> You want the little one?<br> Take the little one.<br> I'll take the redhead.<br> What difference does it make?<br> They're gettin' away. There's<br> nothin' wrong with the little one.<br> The redhead's got<br> nice legs and a nice chest.<br> - I'll take the redhead.<br> - The little one is cute.<br> She has a nice face and those Cupid-bow<br> lips I like, but I'll take the redhead.<br> - You wanted the little one.<br> - I changed my mind.<br> I'll flip you.<br> - Call.<br> - Tails.<br> - I got the little one.<br> - We agree.<br> - Now they gotta agree.<br> - Come on.<br> I'm telling you, you're gonna<br> get on the Ferris wheel this time.<br> Remember when you tried to go on?<br> Last year we tried to get you up there.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - You were scared.<br> Hi. You ladies from around here?<br> Yeah, we work right near here.<br> I'm Billy Shields.<br> I'm a musician.<br> He's with my quintet.<br> I'm Emmet Ray.<br> The Emmet Ray Hot Quintet.<br> We're at the Lakeside Ballroom.<br> It's our day off, so we were thinking<br> maybe you could show us the sights.<br> - You wanna go watch some trains?<br> - What?<br> He's kidding.<br> Let's go for a drink.<br> Ask him. I liked you instantly.<br> I'm bein' honest.<br> We flipped, he won, I got you.<br> I'm Gracie MacRae.<br> Billy Shields.<br> And if I may say, you have the most<br> beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen.<br> This is my friend Hattie.<br> Hattie, I'm Emmet Ray.<br> I've got the quintet.<br> You like jazz music, baby?<br> How about we take<br> a boat ride, huh?<br> Well, sure.<br> We'd love to.<br> - We'll ride around the lake.<br> - Great.<br> What's your name?<br> Don't be shy, darlin'.<br> Hattie don't talk.<br> She's mute.<br> Wanna go take a boat ride?<br> Don't overthrow it.<br> Throw it down.<br> That was a good try.<br> Try it one more time.<br> That was all right.<br> Good try.<br> Thanks for stickin' me<br> with the dummy.<br> - Stop whining. You wanted her.<br> - Then I changed my mind.<br> She seems like a nice girl.<br> How could she seem like anything?<br> She doesn't talk.<br> This is my one day off.<br> I want a talkin' girl.<br> - I think she's a bit of a half-wit.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Gracie says<br> she's not all there in the head.<br> Well, that's great.<br> A man like me, got ideas.<br> Try to have<br> a good time today, huh?<br> You girls wanna<br> go for a walk on the pier?<br> You hungry?<br> Is that a yes or a no?<br> Yeah, me too.<br> What? Huh?<br> I can't read that. It's like a Chinaman.<br> What do you want?<br> Do you know how to write?<br> Did you go to school?<br> What is that?<br> Is that a yes or a no?<br> You're a hard-luck case.<br> You an orphan?<br> You don't know?<br> Oh, this is great.<br> This is great.<br> I get a goddamn mute<br> orphan half-wit.<br> I get all the winners. Were you<br> always like this, born like this?<br> Or did somebody drop you<br> on your head, or what?<br> Gracie's hungry.<br> Let's go get some clams or somethin'.<br> Can we switch for a while?<br> No. What's the matter with you?<br> I was amazing the second<br> I picked up the instrument.<br> It's just in me someplace,<br> like a gift of God.<br> They said I'd have been great,<br> whatever instrument I chose.<br> But on guitar,<br> nobody can touch me.<br> Except this gypsy in France.<br> But mostly, I'm untouchable.<br> They want me to record.<br> They do, but I don't know.<br> Once you record,<br> everybody can copy your stuff.<br> They steal your ideas.<br> Why do I wanna make something beautiful<br> just to have some jerk copy it?<br> You wanna come hear<br> the show sometime? My guest?<br> - Both of you.<br> - Yeah.<br> You'd appreciate it. You would.<br> You'll see.<br> I possess a great talent.<br> You might be mute,<br> but you're not deaf, right?<br> And you don't have to be bright.<br> Music's for everybody.<br> The smart or the dumb.<br> - How'd you lose your voice?<br> - She don't know.<br> It was somethin' when she<br> was a kid, like a high fever.<br> She doesn't remember.<br> - Is she...<br> - Yeah, but she's a good laundress.<br> I've shot guys.<br> That's right.<br> Well, I had to.<br> You know, it was them or me.<br> I could tell you stories.<br> What do you say we go<br> to the dump, shoot some rats?<br> What?<br> Yeah, it'll be a ball.<br> Emmet, please.<br> Not now, huh?<br> Well, it's my car, and I say we're<br> stoppin' at the dump for ten minutes.<br> - Uh, squeeze.<br> - You call this fun?<br> Don't jerk.

She's frownin'.<br> She doesn't like it.<br> Well, they deserved it.<br> They were jerks.<br> She's too good-hearted.<br> A genuinely sweet person.<br> I like that, respect it.<br> Won't get you anywhere in life.<br> I had a dream last night.<br> I had a dream<br> we all went out to Hollywood...<br> and I became discovered<br> as a major star.<br> You? A major star?<br> You were dreamin'.<br> Why not? I got a good face.<br> We're in a short subject.<br> We're the backup band.<br> We're in the background, Emmet.<br> We're lucky to be in focus.<br> You can always get attention<br> if you know how to do it.<br> In this dream,<br> I was standin' there surrounded...<br> by gorgeous actresses.<br> See? That she don't like.<br> Relax.<br> I'm with you now.<br> I'm not one of these guys who turns<br> his head every time some dame walks by.<br> I've had plenty<br> of beautiful women.<br> And I always<br> put 'em in their place.<br> Yeah. "Love 'em and leave 'em,"<br> that's my motto.<br> Love 'em and don't look back.<br> I never once regretted.<br> Not one time did I ever regret<br> dumping a beautiful dame.<br> You gotta keep your guard up.<br> If you don't, them pretty ones get<br> their worms in you, and then it's over.<br> You're done.<br> Particularly if you're an artist.<br> I've seen too many guys<br> cryin' in their beer.<br> Me?<br> I'm gonna be a star.<br> All of me<br> Why not take all of me<br> Can't you see<br> I'm no good without you<br> Take my lips<br> I wanna lose them<br> Take my arms<br> I'll never use them<br> Your good-bye<br> Left me with eyes that cry<br> How can I<br> Go on, dear<br> without you<br> You took the part<br> That once was my heart<br> So why not take all of me<br> The reason Emmet<br> hated Hollywood so much...<br> was because Hattie<br> was discovered, not him.<br> That was the truth of it.<br> She was out there watching him film.<br> Every day she would hang out on the set.<br> And one day, for, you know,<br> some crazy reason...<br> a director, who happened to be working<br> the same lot Emmet was on, noticed her.<br> And the director thought, "This girl<br> is a dead ringer for May Talmadge."<br> He was making a movie with<br> May Talmadge, who was a big star.<br> And he thought Hattie is exactly what<br> he wanted to play May Talmadge's sister.<br> And this is<br> a 30- second part or something.<br> When he found out that Hattie couldn't<br> speak, it didn't make any difference...<br> because the part<br> had no dialogue.<br> He just knew he had to have<br> Hattie to play that part.<br> Well, Emmet hated the whole idea.<br> I can't believe you said yes.<br> Did you nod that dopey face of yours?<br> Do they know you can't speak?<br> I don't get it.<br> You're gonna embarrass me.<br> Suddenly you're a movie actress.<br> Don't make me laugh.<br> Now, as the story goes...<br> Hattie was playing this love scene<br> with William Weston...<br> this handsome older man<br> who always kissed his leading ladies...<br> so they said,<br> with an open mouth.<br> And he was kissing her,<br> and they were doing take after take...<br> and he was kissing her over and over<br> with an open mouth.<br> After 30 takes of getting kissed<br> by this gorgeous leading man...<br> Hattie went into a small coma.<br> And that was the last time...<br> Emmet ever set foot in Hollywood.<br> Yeah, I remember Emmet and Hattie<br> back East at that time.<br> In fact, he had a good manager,<br> this cat named Sid Bishop.<br> Sid was really good to him,<br> and he got him a lot of gigs.<br> Emmet was doing really well,<br> and that really wasn't easy.<br> Back then, a lot of musicians<br> were hurting from the Depression...<br> and there wasn't<br> a lot of work to go around.<br> But Emmet even agreed<br> at that time...<br> to do a couple of sides<br> for the Victor label.<br> He did "Melancholy Baby,"<br> "Exactly Like You"...<br> and "I'll See You In My Dreams."<br> - What do you mean, I'm broke?<br> - You give it away.<br> You drink it up.<br> You pick up checks.<br> You lose it in poolrooms, and<br> you're always buyin' Hattie presents.<br> She's like a kid. She loves<br> tearin' the paper off the box.<br> You gotta go on a budget.<br> I'll go on a budget<br> if someone will straighten me out.<br> A budget's not easy<br> for a guy like you.<br> - When I set my mind to somethin'...<br> - You fight every good idea I have.<br> I'll go on a budget.<br> I'll be good.<br> What do you spend on clothes a year?<br> Do you have any idea?<br> Want me to look like a bum?<br> - What about rent?<br> - I don't know. It's all hotels.<br> - Any idea what you spend on food?<br> - The booze gratis?<br> Help yourself. Do you have any idea<br> what you spend on food or entertainment?<br> Do you have any investments,<br> anything that'll throw off revenue?<br> I got some savings,<br> mostly from Hattie takin' in laundry.<br> Emmet, we gotta look<br> for places to cut down.<br> I burned a hundred dollars once.<br> A guy dared me. He was a four-flusher.<br> He burned a fifty,<br> I burned a hundred.<br> He burned a twenty, I burned<br> another hundred. I could cut that out.<br> You wanna end up<br> in the poorhouse when you're old?<br> You ever see a poorhouse?<br> From now on, your salary<br> and expenses will come to me.<br> I'm puttin' you on an allowance.<br> Okay, that's it.<br> The party's over.<br> Okay, that's it.<br> The party's over.<br> You're spendin' too much,<br> so now we've gotta go on a budget.<br> Now, aside from food,<br> what are your expenses?<br> What about the doctor bills?<br> You got a doctor?<br> I bet you I get you<br> a veterinarian who's cheaper.<br> And this is goin' out.<br> What are we?<br> The electric company?<br> We gotta save every penny.<br> What is that?<br> You remembered my birthday?<br> We can't afford presents.<br> That's gotta go back.<br> It's gotta go back.<br> These are the kid gloves<br> I really wanted.<br> Exactly the gloves<br> I wanted, these are.<br> You know what I'm gonna do?<br> I'm gonna cut you a break.<br> It's my birthday and...<br> So I'm gonna let you<br> give 'em to me.<br> You made this yourself?<br> Your writin' looks like a chicken.<br> Let's see.<br> "It's been almost a year...<br> since we've been together."<br> Ayear?<br> Well, that's scary.<br> What's this word here?<br> Is that... Is that "love"?<br> Oh, no. Don't go gettin'<br> any big ideas here.<br> Jesus.<br> I must've ate somethin' bad.<br> I'm feelin'...<br> I'm gonna be sick.<br> - Got somethin' for me today, Mr. Ray?<br> - I don't.<br> - Mr. Ray, it's me, Charlie.<br> - I'm all tapped out.<br> - You never let me down.<br> - Look.<br> I'd like to help you,<br> but I'm on a budget.<br> I haven't had<br> a bowl of soup all day.<br> What, you wanna make me feel bad?<br> - That's all you get.<br> - All right, thanks.<br> Thanks, Mr. Ray.<br> What's the urgency?<br> I came here as quick as I could.<br> - Would you look at this thing?<br> - This is why I came quick to meet you?<br> - He only wants 4,000 for it.<br> - Yeah, so?<br> Does it fit the budget?<br> Are you kidding?<br> We just sold one of your cars.<br> I'm tryin' to unload<br> the other one, not buy one.<br> - If I cut down?<br> - Cut down?<br> - Where are you gonna get four grand?<br> - I'll borrow the money and pay it off.<br> No one will lend you that kind of money,<br> and you'll be saddled with payments.<br> - I want the car.<br> - No, Emmet.<br> Hattie will give up desserts.<br> - I want the car.<br> - It's out of the question.<br> - I gotta have the car.<br> - You don't have the money.<br> - I gotta have the car.<br> - There's no way!<br> - We can't afford it.<br> - Stop sayin' "we."<br> If I want the car,<br> I'm gonna get it.<br> - Maybe someday, if it's in your budget.<br> - Budget! Budget!<br> You're suffocating me with the budget.<br> I can't buy Hattie a birthday present.<br> You can't buy champagne<br> if you can only afford beer.<br> I'm the best guitar player<br> in the world!<br> If I want the car,<br> I should have it.<br> He said it, but he didn't believe it.<br> He said it, but he didn't believe it.<br> I mean, in his soul,<br> he worshipped Django Reinhardt.<br> It was more than that.<br> He was frozen by him.<br> Django was like a god to him.<br> I don't know if this is true,<br> or just another Emmet Ray story...<br> but Sid Bishop, who was trying<br> to help him financially at the time...<br> got him a job in this club,<br> and one night, just before show time...<br> one of the guys backstage<br> decides to play a joke on him...<br> and tells him this lie.<br> Hey, Emmet!<br> Emmet, you're not gonna believe it.<br> Guess who's sittin' at the front table?<br> Django Reinhardt.<br> Are you kiddin' me? We should<br> get him up on stage with you.<br> Reinhardt.<br> He's gonna show him up.<br> - I'm gonna...<br> - Come on.<br> Emmet, we can get him<br> up on stage with us.<br> - Django Reinhardt's here.<br> - Really?<br> Hey, Django's not in the audience.<br> The house is half-empty. There's<br> just some guy that looks like Django.<br> Let's see if he's got<br> the nerve to come down.<br> - Harry, let's go.<br> - Emmet, we're on!<br> We should do it anyway.<br> Emmet, come on down.<br> I'll wait for you.<br> I'll take you to the front table myself.<br> I'll introduce you to Django.<br> Now, as the story goes...<br> Emmet, as you know, was pathologically<br> phobic about Django Reinhardt...<br> so he tried to escape<br> through the roof.<br> He just figured,<br> to hell with the job that night.<br> But remember, this was a guy<br> who had fainted twice...<br> when he came face-to-face<br> with Django Reinhardt in Europe.<br> He's looking for a way out, and decides<br> to jump to the building next door.<br> Well, as fate would have it,<br> he hits a weak spot in the roof...<br> and crashes through<br> into somebody's apartment.<br> As it happened, the apartment was<br> being used by some counterfeiters...<br> who thought it was a raid when<br> he came through the roof, and ran out.<br> Well, Eddie Durham,<br> the great jazz pioneer...<br> met Emmet in Chicago in the 1930's.<br> Here's what he said<br> about him in his book.<br> "I met Emmet in Chicago.<br> It was the height of the Depression.<br> Work was scarce. A lot of guys<br> took on teaching music as a sideline.<br> Emmet refused.<br> At that time he was married<br> to a woman named Blanche."<br> - What are you doing?<br> - What?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> Excuse me, darling.<br> You were stealing that box.<br> - No.<br> - Oh, yes, you were. I saw you.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> You're a genius, you know?<br> Eubie Blake thinks I'm the best guitar<br> player in the whole world, bar none.<br> - And he knows Django.<br> - Truly?<br> I'm Blanche Williams.<br> - Are you gonna squeal on me?<br> - "Squeal" on you?<br> Gosh. Not only are you<br> vain and egotistical...<br> but you have genuine crudeness.<br> I didn't want the goddamn thing.<br> I won't squeal on you<br> if you take me for a drive...<br> in that sublime automobile<br> of yours.<br> Drive.<br> Where?<br> To the ends of the earth.<br> Astonish me.<br> It's fun, isn't it?<br> Well, it's definitely different.<br> Make sure you don't pull it.<br> You squeeze it.<br> Squeeze the trigger.<br> - Do you do this often?<br> - Every chance I get.<br> Specifically, what's the thrill?<br> Well, I'm not sure, really.<br> There's one.<br> And you got him!<br> Do you get a bigger kick<br> doing this or stealing small objects?<br> You know what?<br> I could really use a drink.<br> I stop in here every time<br> I come through Chicago.<br> She makes great chili.<br> You like chili?<br> What do you think of<br> when you play?<br> What goes through your mind?<br> What are your real feelings?<br> I don't know.<br> That I'm underpaid.<br> I think about that sometimes.<br> Tell me about the girl<br> you lived with.<br> She was nice, but I told her<br> not to fall in love with me.<br> It was very one-sided.<br> She was nice, but I just<br> cut out one night.<br> She was asleep, I left 500 cash<br> by the bed, got my stuff...<br> and got outta there<br> at 4:00 in the morning.<br> I didn't want a scene.<br> She must have really loved you.<br> I didn't say it was<br> an easy decision, but...<br> I needed more than Hattie.<br> - Do you miss her?<br> - Not a bit.<br> I did the right thing for me.<br> Maybe I wouldn't have met you.<br> Come on, Emmet. Join us, man.<br> Cut loose with the fellas.<br> - You know you want to.<br> - Yeah?<br> Please.<br> Come. You'll enjoy this.<br> I'm great. I really am.<br> After-hours jam session.<br> Chicago South Side.<br> He's like a cat...<br> feline with the guitar, which is<br> his only, certainly deepest love.<br> No, his only. The sound...<br> the beat, the ideas.<br> Where do they come from?<br> Any woman would be second<br> to his music.<br> He wouldn't miss me any more<br> than the woman he abruptly left.<br> He could only feel pain<br> for his music.<br> Such is the ego of genius.<br> Must get used to it.<br> I used to have a stable of girls<br> in this town.<br> - No.<br> - Yeah.<br> I made some money, but...<br> whores are unpredictable.<br> - They're nuts.<br> - Really?<br> Yeah. But money's money.<br> I mean, you pimped<br> and you procured?<br> I can't stand it.<br> It's just too perfect.<br> - I don't like that word.<br> - Which?<br> "Pimp." No, I was a manager.<br> - What's too perfect?<br> - That whole seamy world.<br> The girls I came out with were whores<br> too, only we called them debutantes.<br> I lived in a whorehouse<br> when I was 18 for six months.<br> Didn't have a job and no money.<br> The madam put me up.<br> She was a friend of my mother's.<br> I'm sure you learned a lot there.<br> I don't know.<br> It's like being a cook.<br> - A cook?<br> - You're in the kitchen all day.<br> You don't want to look at the food.<br> I'd love to be a whore for a year.<br> Just a year.<br> If you ever want a manager...<br> Look. That's a beauty.<br> What is this fascination<br> with trains?<br> What do you mean?<br> Do you have the urge to go off,<br> to ride to unknown destinations?<br> For what point?<br> Are you trying to recapture some<br> intangible feeling from childhood...<br> when you dreamt of glamorous cities<br> just out of reach?<br> I'm not trying to capture anything<br> from childhood. It stank.<br> Then I can only think it must be<br> the power of the locomotive...<br> the sheer, potent sexual energy<br> that arouses your masculinity.<br> The wheels, the hot furnace,<br> the pistons pumping.<br> You sound like you wanna<br> go to bed with the train.<br> He's impulsive and hot-tempered...<br> yet he listens to the recordings<br> of Django Reinhardt for hours and cries.<br> He has never met this gypsy guitarist<br> and never wants to.<br> I think because he doesn't<br> want to learn Django's mortal.<br> He sleeps with the light on<br> in the room...<br> and last night he woke up screaming<br> the name of his old girlfriend Hattie.<br> Then he asked me to marry him.<br> Get a load of those legs?<br> Take your hat off.<br> She grew up with a butler.<br> It was very impulsive.<br> And as soon as they were married,<br> right from the start...<br> it was very shaky.<br> Why did he marry her so suddenly?<br> I don't know.<br> You know, they only had one thing<br> in common: Clothes.<br> They were like two peacocks.<br> But there was always an unreal<br> quality to the whole thing.<br> Talk about doomed relationships.<br> I feel like gettin' out.<br> Me too, Emmet, but we're broke.<br> He's gonna give me my job back!<br> He said so.<br> If you show up on time,<br> and then not always drunk.<br> Somethin' comes over me.<br> I get cold sweats.<br> You're not sorry we got married,<br> are you?<br> Of course not!<br> You're a beautiful woman.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - What's this all about?<br> I'm trying to analyze your feelings<br> so I can write about them.<br> I'm your husband.<br> I'm not some goddamn book idea!<br> Have you ever cried<br> over the loss of anyone?<br> - Your mother, your father?<br> - Not in me.<br> You let your insides get to you<br> and you're finished.<br> If you just let your feelings out,<br> you might even play better.<br> Richer.<br> Someone else said that to me once.<br> Everybody knows everything.<br> I've been trying to analyze what<br> separates your playing from Django's...<br> and I say it's that<br> his feelings are richer.<br> He's not afraid to suffer<br> in front of anybody.<br> - He doesn't hold things in check...<br> - Stop talking about Django!<br> The guy haunts me. All right?<br> Enough about Django.<br> Yeah.<br> - I want to see Mr. Bedloe.<br> - Be back in a minute.<br> Do you mind if I wait?<br> Got an appointment?<br> - May I?<br> - Go ahead.<br> Nope.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I work for him.<br> I've seen you around.<br> - You're his strong-arm man.<br> - He don't need no help.<br> I saw you beat somebody up<br> in the alley last week.<br> - You're the guitar player's wife.<br> - That's right.<br> - I noticed you too.<br> - You did?<br> Lots of times.<br> Why does Mr. Bedloe<br> need a bodyguard?<br> You come here to ask<br> for your husband's job back?<br> Is it true Mr. Bedloe<br> runs some rackets?<br> Joe thinks the world of<br> your husband's guitar playing.<br> He thinks he's a genius, but...<br> I mean, let's be honest.<br> Either he comes in here late...<br> or he comes in drunk<br> or he don't come in at all...<br> and that's no way<br> to run a nightclub.<br> I thinkJoe's cooled down.<br> He was pretty hot the other night.<br> I hope you don't<br> mind me asking, but...<br> you're wearing a gun,<br> aren't you?<br> Not me.<br> Did you ever kill anyone?<br> Don't tell me that you never<br> noticed me staring at you.<br> - No, I...<br> - You come in here a couple of nights.<br> I couldn't take my eyes off you.<br> - Really?<br> - I love that blue silk dress you wear.<br> Oh, yes. That... Gee.<br> It's warm in here.<br> Morning, Mr. Bedloe.<br> You're a smart girl.<br> You come from a good home.<br> What are you doin' with a drunken<br> guitar player for a husband?<br> Okay, he's a brilliant musician,<br> but who can live with him?<br> Not me.<br> I'll bet it's no picnic for you.<br> He wants me to tell you<br> he's learned his lesson.<br> Do you think<br> I was born yesterday?<br> - I know you think he's great.<br> - Great? His playin' makes me cry.<br> Does he bring in customers?<br> Some.<br> Mostly aficionados.<br> When he shows up.<br> We found him the other night<br> staring at freight trains at 9:00.<br> - He's gonna turn over a new leaf.<br> - Right.<br> He's through drinkin'.<br> Right. All right, look.<br> I'm a soft touch, but I don't<br> like to be made a fool.<br> Out of respect for you, who I like,<br> I'm gonna give him one more shot.<br> But if you want my advice,<br> no genius is worth too much heartache.<br> - How'd you do?<br> - He's such a nice man.<br> You wanna celebrate?<br> - Celebrate?<br> - Yeah, have a drink with me.<br> Come on.<br> Well, I guess.<br> There are a few things<br> I wouldn't mind finding out.<br> I'm a writer, and extreme characters<br> always fascinate me.<br> I ain't so extreme.<br> Everybody I ever rubbed out<br> deserved it.<br> "Rubbed out"?<br> That's so colorful and...<br> What goes through your mind<br> when you're rubbing someone out?<br> Through my mind?<br> What do you think about<br> when you pull the trigger?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Yet you're able<br> to just shoot someone.<br> I don't want to shock you, but...<br> it always came natural to me.<br> Really?<br> Ever since I was 15<br> and I first picked up a gun...<br> I discovered that<br> I had a knack for it.<br> Fascinating.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - You have very soft hair.<br> - Don't.<br> - Why?<br> I'm scared.<br> Because I kill for a living.<br> Because I find you attractive.<br> Blanche was a writer.<br> Some kind of a writer.<br> Not famous or anything,<br> but she was published.<br> In fact, she wrote a story called...<br> "Strutting and Fretting."<br> And it's vaguely about some of the<br> stormy times she and Emmet were having.<br> Why am I bored with my husband?<br> It's all so complicated.<br> In the end, I married<br> for the wrong reasons.<br> And why Emmet rushed into marriage<br> with me is a mystery.<br> Five in the corner.<br> - That's all she wrote.<br> - Lucky shot.<br> You couldn't make<br> that shot again if you tried.<br> Don't give me that.<br> Just hand it over.<br> I'm one of the two, three top<br> pool players in the country.<br> No shame in losin' to me.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Come here. I want to talk to you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Look, we know each other, right?<br> I don't like to cause<br> any problems...<br> so I wanted to give you<br> a little tip.<br> On a horse? Couple of beers.<br> No, not on a horse.<br> I want to give you a tip.<br> Keep an eye on your wife.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Just keep an eye on her.<br> Why?<br> Because she's been spendin'<br> a lot of time with Al Torrio.<br> Who?<br> Al Torrio. The hood<br> that hangs around Bedloe.<br> The bodyguard? And Blanche?<br> Are you nuts?<br> - Just tellin' you what's goin' around.<br> - What kind of mind you got?<br> Blanche'd never make a fool outta me<br> with some strong- arm stooge.<br> - Where'd you hear this?<br> - Here and there.<br> That's why I'm telling you. I didn't<br> think you'd want people laughin' at you.<br> Laughin' at me?<br> You know how rumors get started.<br> Come on. This is what happens when you<br> have a wife everybody's envious of.<br> It's jealousy,<br> but I'm not the jealous type.<br> - They're tryin' to knock me down.<br> - Hope you're right.<br> I've heard stories about this<br> from musicians...<br> I've read about it,<br> but I don't really know.<br> I know that...<br> apparently, Emmet tried<br> to follow Blanche one day.<br> I believe she told him she was<br> going to the dentist or something...<br> and he followed her.<br> You gotta go home right away?<br> I think Emmet's at the poolroom.<br> Come on.<br> Let's go for a drive.<br> You know, I didn't<br> care too much for that movie.<br> - No?<br> - I like Cagney.<br> Guns, bullets, shootin',<br> a little action.<br> How does it feel<br> when you actually kill?<br> What goes through your mind?<br> What do you gotta ask<br> the questions for all the time?<br> Because I wanna know.<br> Emmet has a violent side, but it<br> all turns to passion in his music.<br> With you there's just not<br> a shred of sublimation.<br> It's incredible.<br> Let me ask you one question.<br> Who makes love to you better,<br> me or him?<br> Emmet is an artist,<br> and because he's an artist...<br> he needs no one.<br> Even making love, he seems to exist<br> in a world all of his own.<br> With you I feel like I'm looking<br> right into the heart of darkness.<br> I become crazy when you touch me.<br> Okay, so now Emmet is fuming.<br> Okay, so now Emmet is fuming.<br> I mean, he found out<br> that Torrio and Blanche...<br> have gone to bed with each other,<br> that they're lovers.<br> And he's consumed with rage.<br> Now, just at that moment,<br> Torrio decides to pull off the road...<br> and go into a gas station<br> to buy some cigarettes.<br> And there's Emmet<br> in the back of the car...<br> and he's trying very hard to<br> figure out who he wants to shoot.<br> Does he want to shoot Blanche?<br> Torrio?<br> Should he shoot<br> both of them together?<br> He's working on this problem.<br> They go into the store,<br> and exactly at that moment...<br> a holdup is taking place.<br> Two guys come running out.<br> They don't know what to do.<br> All hell is breaking loose.<br> There's gunshots.<br> Instead of taking their car...<br> Torrio's got a big car.<br> They jump in that and pull off.<br> Calling all cars.<br> I'm Emmet Ray.<br> I'm the greatest guitar player<br> in the world.<br> Except maybe this gypsy.<br> Perhaps you heard my recording of<br> "You Were Meant For Me," RCA Victor.<br> You were meant for me<br> That's not what I heard.<br> That's not what I heard.<br> But like all Emmet Ray stories...<br> you never know what's made up,<br> exaggerated, true.<br> You never know what to believe.<br> What I heard was this.<br> I heard that when they<br> pulled into the gas station...<br> Blanche gets out<br> to get some cigarettes...<br> and that's<br> when he confronted them.<br> How could you? How could you<br> cheat on me with a bum like that?<br> Emmet, don't!<br> Make a fool out of me<br> in front of everybody!<br> So I slept with him.<br> But I was just researching a book!<br> I loved you!<br> Don't be crazy. Do something!<br> I'm sorry. My tire blew out.<br> Believe me, he never tried to kill<br> himself, because Emmet Ray was...<br> He had much too much ego<br> for anything like that.<br> A story that Eddie Condon<br> tells about...<br> And Eddie Condon definitely<br> was not a reliable source...<br> 'cause he was<br> a big embellisher himself.<br> But the story Eddie Condon tells,<br> I believe...<br> is that Torrio was aware...<br> that the fact that he was a gangster<br> was a big turn- on for Blanche.<br> And so he decided...<br> And so he decided...<br> that he would<br> pull into this gas station...<br> and he would stick it up.<br> - Can I help you, sir?<br> - Get your hands in the air, Pops.<br> Give me everything<br> in the register!<br> Emmet was so panicked<br> by hearing gunshots...<br> he crept into the front seat<br> and took off.<br> He didn't get more than 50 feet<br> before he crashed into an oncoming car.<br> Now there's this terrible crash.<br> Miraculously, no one is hurt.<br> And who gets out of the car<br> but a group of musicians.<br> I can't remember who it was.<br> It was like Buck Clayton, Coleman<br> Hawkins, Teddy Wilson or something.<br> But there, suddenly,<br> standing in front of Emmet...<br> is Django Reinhardt.<br> I believe later that year...<br> Emmet turned up in New Jersey...<br> and made that recording he did<br> of one of his own compositions.<br> "Unfaithful Woman."<br> Very good, everybody.<br> - Particularly me.<br> - That was great. And me.<br> - Let's go get somethin' to eat.<br> - Emmet, we're going to New York.<br> We're goin' to New York.<br> The big money.<br> Can I get those cigarettes?<br> Em, I tell you, the music business<br> really picked up, just like you said.<br> We got some dancers lined up for<br> tonight, pretty ones. They are wild.<br> How are you?<br> You look healthy.<br> I'm in town makin' a record.<br> I wrote a beautiful tune.<br> It's a classic.<br> I'm sorry I cut out<br> on you like that.<br> It was time to move on.<br> I was fair. I told you<br> not to fall in love with me.<br> It's nothin' personal.<br> It's just, I'm an artist.<br> I like women,<br> but they gotta have their place.<br> You angry with me?<br> You have every right to be.<br> I don't hold it against you.<br> I even thought of you<br> a couple of times.<br> My wife said...<br> I said your name once<br> in my sleep.<br> Must have had a nightmare<br> or somethin'.<br> Yeah.<br> I had a wife. She's gone now,<br> and believe me, I don't miss her.<br> I don't mean to say<br> I miss you either...<br> but I didn't have<br> any bad feelings about you.<br> We got a real good contract at a club<br> in New York for a year. Good dough.<br> Maybe you'd like to come.<br> You know?<br> I'm not makin' any promises, but...<br> I think you might have fun.<br> You'd be in New York with...<br> one of the two best<br> guitar players in the world...<br> six best poker players.<br> Not countin' that.<br> We leave tomorrow, if you want.<br> If you don't, I understand.<br> You know? Then it'd be<br> "It was nice seeing you again.<br> Good luck."<br> I never could<br> get your handwritin'.<br> Happily?<br> Got kids?<br> Boy or girl?<br> Boy?<br> Girl?<br> It's just as well.<br> I wouldn't want to give you the wrong<br> impression. You'd get attached to me.<br> And you know me.<br> I can't take entanglements.<br> I gotta go. We're gonna take<br> some chorus girls out tonight.<br> And I'm leavin' tomorrow.<br> Take it easy.<br> I'm the greatest solo instrumentalist<br> on the guitar you'll ever hear.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> The public's just getting to know my<br> name. Next year, I'll be in the money.<br> You're a real looker.<br> You are a real looker.<br> - You're not that bad yourself.<br> - I mean it!<br> Maybe that's why the men give me<br> a lot of tips when I dance.<br> You wanna go watch trains?<br> What?<br> - Come on.<br> - Trains?<br> Wait. Where are we going?<br> - Jesus.<br> - Outta the way.<br> Grab my stuff. Jesus.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - My cigarettes!<br> Where do you think<br> you're taking me?<br> Where's my cigarettes?<br> Leave them alone.<br> Let's just go.<br> Come on.<br> Let's go watch trains.<br> You almost lost me there, you know.<br> Did you see that?<br> Jesus. What are we doing here?<br> I like to sit out...<br> and look at the trains pass.<br> Yeah. To each his own, I say.<br> I mean, I don't understand it.<br> I can make my guitar<br> sound like a train.<br> God! I mean, I'm a nice girl.<br> I don't understand<br> why you'd bring me here.<br> I can make my guitar<br> sound just like a train.<br> I got a warm room we can go to.<br> Come on. I'll take care of you.<br> Come on. It's nice.<br> Jesus, I don't understand why you would<br> bring a nice girl like me out here.<br> I'm takin' requests.<br> Do you know "Sweet Sue"?<br> All right, are you finished?<br> Can we go now?<br> I really have to pee, you know.<br> I gotta go to the bathroom.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Go on.<br> - What?<br> - Get outta here.<br> What? What are you talk...<br> - You dragged me out here.<br> - Just leave me alone.<br> - What?<br> - Leave me alone!<br> I don't need anybody!<br> - I made a mistake!<br> - Yeah. I'll say.<br> I made mistake!<br> I have no idea<br> what happened to Emmet Ray.<br> He just sort of disappeared,<br> I guess.<br> He did make, though,<br> in those last couple of years...<br> he made really<br> his best recordings.<br> He never played more beautifully,<br> more movingly.<br> Something just seemed<br> to kind of open up in him.<br> It was amazing,<br> because he was, finally...<br> every bit as good<br> as Django Reinhardt.<br> And then he just, you know,<br> seemed to fade away.<br> I mean, I have no idea.<br> Some people said<br> he went to Europe.<br> And some people feel that he may<br> have stopped playing altogether.<br> But we do have, fortunately,<br> those last recordings he made.<br> And they're great.<br> They're absolutely beautiful.<br>
