Yeah.<br> - Bob.<br> My brother wants to know...<br> ...have you ever tried liquid MDMA?<br> Liquid MDMA? No.<br> Tehran is the world capital.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> You've got a... friend there.<br> How's the kid?<br> He's fine.<br> He's...<br> He's fine.<br> Arash, when you wanna do this?<br> After prayer.<br> Okay.<br> - You said they were both for you.<br> - What do you care?<br> Not a move!<br> Okay. Okay.<br> I was looking for the bathroom.<br> Not a word. Shut up!<br> Okay.<br> You don't speak Farsi, do you,<br> you son of a goat?<br> Georgetown<br> Washington, DC<br> Mr. Whiting, I'm Bennett Holiday.<br> A very big company, Connex,<br> our client...<br> ...Ioses a huge natural-gas contract<br> in the Persian Gulf...<br> ...to the Chinese. At the same time...<br> ...a smaller company, Killen, somehow<br> gets the rights to Kazakhstan...<br> ...one of the largest<br> untapped oil fields in the world.<br> The big company, our client,<br> merges with Killen...<br> ...Justice wants to know<br> how Killen got those rights.<br> You've been scrutinizing<br> exactly these types of deals...<br> ...so if there's something to find...<br> ...I expect you to get it before they do.<br> And come straight to me.<br> Bennett.<br> Sir?<br> At my firm, I have a flock of sheep...<br> ...who think they're lions.<br> Maybe you're a lion<br> everyone thinks is a sheep.<br> No, I wanna talk about the Gulf,<br> and how a goddamn emir...<br> Connex Oil<br> Houston, Texas<br> - What is an emir anyway?<br> - King, it's a king.<br> A king. Well, how some Podunk king<br> tossed you out on your ass.<br> Every company in the world<br> wanted into Kazakhstan...<br> ...into the Tengiz, but Killen got it.<br> And then Connex wanted Killen,<br> and here we are.<br> I made investments.<br> Investments that'll bear fruit<br> for this company.<br> Hell, Tommy, we've all got<br> the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act...<br> ...committed to memory.<br> I got a little copy of it taped<br> to the wall of my head. Right here.<br> Thanks, Jimmy. We appreciate<br> hearing your point of view.<br> However, a U.S. Attorney...<br> ...is looking into your relationships<br> in Kazakhstan...<br> ...and the U.S. Government is holding off<br> on approval of our merger.<br> So Mr. Janus and I have brought...<br> ...Connex's Washington counsel,<br> Sydney Hewitt...<br> ...down here to talk about<br> our strategy for the next 30 days.<br> Sydney?<br> In a way, I feel like Switzerland.<br> I'd like to remind everybody<br> in this room...<br> ...they've signed<br> confidentiality agreements.<br> Allow me to introduce my associate,<br> Bennett Holiday...<br> ...who will be... How shall I put it?<br> - Building consensus day-to-day.<br> Good morning.<br> You've just visited what<br> someday soon...<br> ...could be the most profitable<br> corporation in America.<br> Provided the government<br> approves the merger.<br> Provided we don't start<br> running automobiles on water.<br> And provided there's still chaos<br> in the Middle East.<br> Now the job is, find the problem,<br> fix the problem.<br> And if you do not find a problem,<br> then there is no problem.<br> And when the government<br> approves this merger...<br> ...it's gonna buy a lot of houses<br> in the Vineyard.<br> Maybe even yours.<br> Geneva, Switzerland<br> Cheerios again?<br> - Max!<br> - Max!<br> - Hey, man.<br> - Let's not read at the table, okay?<br> - Put this hand here. Block me.<br> - Sweetie, sweetie.<br> - Mommy? I want bacon.<br> - Yeah?<br> - You have bacon.<br> - I want real bacon.<br> You have real bacon,<br> only it's made from soy beans.<br> I want pig bacon.<br> I want pig bacon too.<br> - Don't say it.<br> - I'll try it if you try it.<br> - I don't know if I can bite this.<br> - It's crunchy.<br> - How'd you do that?<br> - It's kind of hard to cut.<br> - It's pretty bad.<br> - You be quiet.<br> A merger between two U.S. Oil<br> companies is taking place in Houston.<br> The new company,<br> Connex-Killen Corporation...<br> ... will become the fifth largest<br> oil and gas company in the world.<br> The move affects 37,000 workers<br> in 160 countries...<br> ... and with revenues larger<br> than the gross domestic product...<br> ... of Pakistan or Denmark, will create<br> the world's 23rd largest economy.<br> Mr. Leland Janus, chairman of Connex,<br> spoke today of synergy...<br> ... and a desire to pass on savings<br> to the consumer.<br> The merged operations<br> will create economies of scale...<br> ...to deliver the best products to the<br> consumer at the lowest possible prices.<br> LELAND JANUS<br> CEO, CONNEX OIL<br> It's a merger of necessity for Connex,<br> Rebecca, who wants Killen 's fields...<br> ... in Kazakhstan, after gas blocks<br> they pursued in the Gulf...<br> ... were awarded<br> to a Chinese consortium.<br> Producer nations continue to look<br> toward developing markets in Asia...<br> ... which is having a powerful effect<br> on crude prices.<br> There's at least 10 to 12 dollars<br> of instability premium.<br> You have protests in Iran,<br> the threat of more strikes in Venezuela...<br> ...and the Turks still making noise about<br> Russian crude through the Bosphorus.<br> All right, thanks for having me, Rebecca.<br> I'm playing. That's my job, playing.<br> Yeah, well, that's a very,<br> very good job for you to have.<br> - Tell Daddy you love him.<br> - I love you, Daddy.<br> Hey.<br> The emir's summer party,<br> Marbella, this weekend.<br> Any interest?<br> Well, I can't.

Take the children with you.<br> The beach, summer, Marbella.<br> Max'll love it.<br> - Can I do that?<br> - Sure you can.<br> Besides, they love children.<br> John D.

I think we've got something<br> for you, something you'll like...<br> ...that utilizes your specific skill set.<br> You know this guy?<br> - Prince Nasir Al-Subaai.<br> - His money's in a lot of dark corners...<br> ...paying for weapons<br> that could be used against the U.S.A.<br> Paperwork on polygraphs.<br> Wire transfers to Qaeda fronts.<br> Letters instructing his water ministry<br> to employ Mohammed Sheik Agiza...<br> ...the guy who has your missile.<br> He's traveling to Beirut.<br> You have experience in Beirut.<br> It's a great city.<br> This is a bad guy.<br> And, who knows, maybe you'll find<br> your blue-eyed Egyptian.<br> - I sent you a report on...<br> - Sorry, I gotta get going.<br> My daughter's got a soccer game.<br> Big one.<br> Did you see my missile report?<br> I reset the guidance to blow 10 feet...<br> Bob, you just don't get it.<br> Nobody wants to hear about<br> a missing missile, not right now.<br> This is top of the director's list.<br> Hit a walk-off home run...<br> ...you get any desk you want.<br> Sheik Hamad has not yet made<br> a decision about who will succeed him.<br> In our view, Prince Nasir...<br> ...is likely the more ambitious<br> of the two brothers.<br> This, however, does not mean...<br> ...that he will prevail<br> in any succession struggle.<br> Your generosity is bigger than a mountain<br> that shades us from the burning sun.<br> My house has grown too small<br> for my family.<br> If we had more land...<br> ...then my son could build<br> his own house.<br> My father has ordered<br> the Marbella estate to be razed.<br> There'll be a park.<br> We're so sorry for your loss.<br> Six more North Field blocks<br> are being developed.<br> We'd like to offer your firm the rights.<br> Six blocks?<br> - Which phase?<br> - Third phase.<br> Okay, so we'd be<br> in the stream for...<br> ...10 one-hundredths of a cent.<br> So $ 75 million.<br> Seventy... Great. That's great.<br> How much for my other kid?<br> You know, if I were your<br> economic adviser, I'd tell you that...<br> ...that's not the stupidest thing,<br> financially, you've done...<br> ...but probably just the dumbest thing<br> you'll do today. Probably.<br> But why would you need<br> an economic adviser?<br> Years ago, you had<br> the highest GNP in the world.<br> Today, you're tied with Albania.<br> So good work.<br> Your second biggest export<br> is secondhand goods...<br> ...followed closely by dates,<br> for which you lose 5 cents a pound.<br> You know what the business world<br> thinks of you? We think 100 years ago...<br> ...you were living in tents,<br> chopping each other's heads off...<br> ...and that's exactly where you'll be<br> in another 100.<br> So, yes, on behalf of my firm,<br> I accept your money. Thank you.<br> Fine. I'll have the funds<br> transferred to your firm immediately.<br> Great.<br> And I'll give you 100 million<br> for the other kid.<br> So now you're my economic adviser...<br> ...why don't you tell me something<br> I don't already know.<br> All right. You want an idea?<br> Here's an idea.<br> There's the Eurasian triangle.<br> Your kingdom is here. Iran is there.<br> You've been selling your oil...<br> ...sticking it on ships and watching<br> as it sails away around Africa to there.<br> Pretend for a second that<br> this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity.<br> That's your route. Right there.<br> Overland, through Iran.<br> Hook up with these pipes.<br> Commoditize it, control it...<br> ...take it to the doorstep<br> of every home in Europe.<br> I just doubled your profit.<br> I think that's a pretty good idea.<br> Hondo, Texas<br> My granddaddy was a wildcatter.<br> Same with my daddy.<br> That's how I got my start.<br> Luck and hard work.<br> Nobody handed me shit.<br> Now I got...<br> ...libraries and parks named after me.<br> And I'll probably ruin my grandkids.<br> You wearing a wire, Bennett?<br> No.<br> Mr. Janus...<br> ...chairman of Connex...<br> ...and Dean Whiting,<br> founding partner of your firm...<br> ...are proud members of<br> the Committee to Liberate Iran.<br> Danny D. Here is too.<br> D is for "Dalton." I was on the<br> other side of the Tengiz deal.<br> "The other side"?<br> El Presidente Nazarbayev's best pal<br> in the whole world.<br> She's a beautiful field, the Tengiz.<br> Goddamn, is she a beautiful field.<br> What is it?

That's the charm.<br> - That's the number, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> I like consulting.<br> No, I love it.<br> Love it. And I'll say this for it:<br> Private business is efficient.<br> There, I've said it. Fucking clich.<br> And the CIA is, like, what,<br> a 30-billion-a-year business...<br> ...so anybody who wants<br> to sell anything, a pencil, a computer...<br> ...they gotta interface through<br> a security clearance. Don't give me shit.<br> I got two kids in college,<br> and we're doing our kitchen.<br> Stan, I got a chance<br> to go back to Beirut.<br> I wanna go back.<br> Is it safe for me?<br> Are we talking about with your wife<br> or with the wackos?<br> Clear it with Hezbollah.<br> Hezbollah-controlled suburb<br> Beirut, Lebanon<br> Said Hashimi.

He'll disappear.<br> Take him from his hotel, drug him,<br> put him in the front of a car...<br> ...and run a truck into him<br> at 50 miles an hour.<br> It's good to have you back in town, Bob.<br> We begin the process of empowering<br> a new generation of Arabs...<br> Beirut.<br> No, no. He invited me<br> to come with him.<br> I think he thinks he's some kind<br> of reformer or something.<br> Anyway, he's got a nice private plane.<br> Hold on, Vincent.<br> Hey.<br> Beirut? It's great. It's like the...<br> It's like the Paris of the Middle East.<br> Yeah, it's like... It's like winning the NIT.<br> - However, unlike Washington's<br> Greater Middle East Initiative...<br> It's a bad...

Not before<br> he goes into another mosque...<br> ...or a newspaper<br> and the story gains traction. No.<br> - He have Bob's name?<br> - Not his real name.<br> Mussawi's shopping photos<br> of them doing the deal, long lens.<br> Photos of Bob being held.<br> We're lucky this guy is alive.<br> The whole contact was a setup. Mussawi<br> now apparently works with Iran.<br> First he tortures our guy,<br> then he peddles the CIA connection.<br> Put some space between us and Bob.<br> Bob has a long history<br> of entrepreneurial operations.<br> We haven't really had a handle<br> on Bob for years.<br> After 9/11, some people got leeway,<br> let their emotions get the best of them.<br> These are complex times.<br> There's already an active investigation...<br> ...into Bob's activities in...<br> Help me out here.<br> Tehran, the Amiri brothers job.<br> We're finding out who hired Bob<br> for the Amiri brothers job.<br> Could the same people<br> be behind the Nasir job?<br> A lot of people probably want<br> this Nasir dead...<br> ...and Bob knows lots of people.<br> Fill in the rest.<br> Send me everything.<br> Walter Reed Hospital<br> Washington, DC<br> You first established contact<br> with the Amiri brothers in 1998?<br> Yeah.<br> - You met them at a party in France?<br> - Yes.<br> A party given by Reza Reyhani?<br> Reza, yes.<br> Were you aware they were<br> in illegal arms trade?<br> Of course I was aware.<br> That's why I went.<br> Were you aware these two men<br> were Iranian intelligence officers?<br> - What do you think?<br> - This is a diplomatic incident.<br> Two men have been murdered.<br> We've been tasked<br> with the damage assessment.<br> We'll need you to turn<br> your passport over to us.<br> Passports.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, I found this.<br> Wire transfer.<br> In Russian.

"Great."<br> They're thinking, "Keep playing,<br> keep buying yourself new toys.<br> Keep spending $50,000 a night<br> on your hotel room.<br> But don't invest in your infrastructure.<br> Don't build a real economy."<br> So that when you finally wake up,<br> they will have sucked you dry...<br> ...and you will have squandered<br> the greatest natural resource in history.<br> Come with me, please.<br> I studied at Oxford.<br> I have a Ph.D. From Georgetown.<br> I want to create a parliament.<br> I want to give women the right to vote.<br> I want an independent judiciary.<br> I want to start a petroleum exchange<br> in the Middle East...<br> ...cut the speculators<br> out of the business.<br> Why are the major oil exchanges<br> in London and New York anyway?<br> I'll put all of our energy<br> up for competitive bidding.<br> I'll run pipe through Iran to Europe,<br> like you proposed.<br> I'll ship to China.<br> Anything that achieves efficiency<br> and maximizes profit.<br> Profit which I will then use<br> to rebuild my country.<br> - That's exactly what you should do.<br> - Exactly.<br> Except your president<br> rings my father and says:<br> "I've got unemployment in Texas,<br> Kansas, Washington state."<br> A phone call later, we're stealing<br> out of our social programs...<br> ...in order to buy overpriced airplanes.<br> We owed the Americans,<br> but we've repaid that debt.<br> I accepted a Chinese bid,<br> the highest bid...<br> ...and suddenly I'm a terrorist.<br> I'm a godless communist.<br> Dean Whiting...<br> ...who represents not only these<br> aggrieved royals and my brother...<br> ...but also Connex Oil...<br> ...they've been pressuring my father<br> to invalidate the Chinese contract.<br> But they underestimate him.<br> This is about his legacy to his people.<br> I know it seems like<br> people sitting in hotel rooms.<br> That's how they do business.<br> But we're...<br> We're talking world historical stage here.<br> I mean, with the... With the delivery<br> deals we could make in Europe...<br> ...transport through Iran.<br> This guy might be able to revolutionize...<br> ...not just his country,<br> but the whole region.<br> As soon as his father keels over, this<br> guy could be like Mossadegh in '52...<br> ...in Iran.

No, sir.<br> Corruption charges. Corruption?<br> Corruption is government intrusion...<br> ...into market efficiencies<br> in the form of regulation.<br> That's Milton Friedman.<br> He got a goddamn Nobel Prize.<br> We have laws against it precisely<br> so we can get away with it.<br> Corruption is our protection.<br> Corruption keeps us safe and warm!<br> Corruption is why you and I are<br> prancing around in here...<br> ...instead of fighting over scraps of meat<br> out in the street.<br> Corruption is why we win.<br> How'd it go?<br> Well, he's got kids, a wife.<br> He broke the law.<br> Mr. Janus himself wanted me<br> to extend you an invitation...<br> ...to Oilman of the Year.<br> He's being honored...<br> ...so it should be a nice weekend.<br> Relax.

Very well.<br> Then you also know your client<br> is into some shady stuff...<br> ...and it's starting to look like<br> you could be involved...<br> ...in hiding the true nature<br> of the transactions.<br> That's quite a statement, Don.<br> One word:<br> Dalton.<br> Danny Dalton?<br> Defrauded the government of Kazakhstan<br> of funds to which it was entitled.<br> Defrauded the people of Kazakhstan<br> of the right to the honest services...<br> ...of their elected<br> and appointed officials.<br> Seven years. Does three,<br> maybe two and a half...<br> ...on your recommendation.<br> - Now, let me guess.<br> This was a solo act, without<br> the knowledge of Connex or Killen Oil...<br> ...and Mr. Lee Janus or Jimmy Pope.<br> Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.<br> And he'll have a nice little trust fund<br> when he gets out.<br> Not so little, I imagine.<br> Look, Don, we can spend<br> the next five years in court...<br> ...to get back to the very place<br> that we're at right now.<br> And they will fight tough.<br> They'll fight dirty.<br> They'll pressure your boss...<br> ...the people who appointed your boss...<br> ...the wives of the people<br> who appointed your boss.<br> And you will never hit them any harder<br> than this, and you know it.<br> I'm sorry, Bennett.<br> I don't think Dalton's enough.<br> What are you looking at, man?<br> - I didn't say anything.<br> - That's because you have nothing to say.<br> You fucking asshole.<br> There we go.<br> Okay, pal.<br> Come on. Yeah, I know.<br> I know, I know, I know.<br> - Hey, Fred!<br> - You've been such a good boy.<br> Fred.<br> Hey, Bob.<br> There you go, pal.<br> I tell you what, Katie, take that in.<br> Hey, Jack.

That's pretty clear.<br> Nothing I can do, you know it.<br> It's a criminal investigation.<br> - Two men were killed.<br> - I was almost killed.<br> Now they're asking me questions<br> about the Amiri brothers, about Tehran.<br> Understand, this wrecks careers.<br> I shouldn't even be talking to you.<br> I punched in "Prince Nasir Al-Subaai,"<br> and my computer gets seized.<br> Where'd that job come from?<br> Where did the Nasir job come from?<br> I'm advising you to drop it.<br> Why am I being investigated?<br> Why am I being investigated, Fred?<br> Goodbye, Bob.<br> It's okay. Hey, hey.<br> What's up?<br> If I truly lack faith...<br> ...then I am not the right person.<br> The questioning means<br> that you have faith...<br> ...and makes it stronger.<br> That's a lot of shit, I think.<br> We'll be able to intervene in the<br> affairs of family members.<br> We'll be able to help them with<br> whatever they need.<br> You'll be able to get your mother here.<br> Please.<br> I am tired.<br> Father...<br> ...who will be emir?<br> Your brother.<br> Praise be to God.<br> I would ask you to remain<br> as foreign minister.<br> You cannot do this.<br> He is barely qualified to run a brothel,<br> much less a country.<br> I like Europe.<br> I will be happy to stay here.<br> My decision is final...<br> ...and I ask you to support your brother.<br> I cannot do that.<br> For centuries Arabs have been ruled by<br> people with no respect for law...<br> ...monopolies handed out for the<br> things that people want...<br> ...commerce stifled, young people<br> unable to find jobs.<br> Anyone who criticizes is thrown in jail...<br> ...or put to death.<br> And women...<br> ...are treated as second-class citizens.<br> The coronation is tomorrow...<br> ...and your brother<br> has the support of the Americans.<br> And 10,000 of their troops<br> are stationed in our country.<br> True.<br> My father is ill and weak, and unwilling<br> to oppose the Americans.<br> But others are willing.<br> When a country has 5 percent<br> of the world's population...<br> ...but does 50 percent<br> of its military spending...<br> ...then the persuasive powers of that<br> country are on the decline.<br> They're worried.<br> About fallout. They're worried...<br> ...you might wanna talk about it.<br> But if you're already<br> under investigation...<br> What about Mussawi?<br> He's a soldier.<br> He's just like you.<br> Why are they doing a damage<br> assessment on the Amiris...<br> ...and on me for doing my job?<br> This is about our interests in the region.<br> So if Prince Nasir won't allow<br> our military bases in his country...<br> ...and his little brother will...<br> ...well, we'll probably have to<br> do something about that.<br> Who's worried about the Nasir job?<br> Who's worried about me talking?<br> Stan.<br> Who's worried?<br> Hello?<br> Hello, is this Mr. Whitting?<br> This is Homeseal Security.<br> Yes, this is Mr. Whiting.<br> Hi, we're showing a motion-sensor<br> failure in your downstairs study.<br> Yes?<br> Like I said, we're getting<br> a failure message.<br> Want me to stay on the phone<br> while you walk around, or send a car?<br> I'll walk around.<br> Everything seems fine.<br> How are we doing, Mr. Whiting?<br> Everything's fine.<br> - The door's unlocked.<br> - Did you leave it unlocked?<br> Send a car, you imbecile.<br> You were in Beirut in '84.<br> I lost friends there...<br> ...as I'm sure you did.<br> I got a peek at your file.<br> You're a good man.<br> One whose experience<br> is narrow and deep.<br> Your entire career...<br> ...you've been used.<br> And probably never even known<br> what for.<br> I didn't use to need to know.<br> In this town, you're innocent<br> until you're investigated.<br> Innocent until investigated? That's nice.<br> It's got a nice ring to it.<br> I bet you've worn some miles<br> on little sayings like that.<br> Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - No.<br> Gives the listener the sense of the law<br> being written as it's spoken.<br> If anything happens to me<br> or my family...<br> ...an accident, an accusation, anything...<br> ...then, first, your son will disappear.<br> His body will never be found.<br> Then your wife.<br> Her body will never be found either.<br> Now, this is guaranteed.<br> Then whatever is the most dangerous<br> thing that you do...<br> ...it might be flying in a small plane...<br> ...might be walking to the bank...<br> ...you'll be killed.<br> Do you understand what I'm saying?<br> I want you to acknowledge<br> that you do understand...<br> ...so that we're clear<br> and there won't be any mistakes.<br> Beirut rules, Mr. Barnes?<br> I want my passports back.<br> We are a small group...<br> ...the ones who carry convictions<br> and ambitions.<br> And within this group...<br> ...there is another, smaller group...<br> ...who flee from the worldly life...<br> ...in order to spread the true faith.<br> You're ready.<br> Connex-Killen Oil announces the gift<br> of a new children 's hospital...<br> ... to be built in honor of the new emir.<br> I wanted to be on a bobsled<br> in the Olympics.<br> What's a bobsled?<br> Wasim knows what a bobsled is.<br> Papa, I need to ask you...<br> Tell him about the bobsled!<br> Tell him what a bobsled is.<br> It's a little car.<br> A little car that goes down a track<br> of ice and snow.<br> Papa, may I borrow some money<br> for the bus?<br> Oh, how the snow sparkles,<br> the crunch of it under your feet...<br> Dalton's not enough.<br> I would be real careful.<br> You dig a 6-foot hole,<br> you'll find three bodies.<br> But you dig 12,<br> and maybe you'll find 40.<br> China's economy ain't growing<br> as fast as it could...<br> ...because they can't get<br> all the oil they need.<br> Now, I'm damn proud of that fact.<br> We need another body, Mr. Pope.<br> What if...?<br> What if it involved somebody<br> at your firm?<br> Someone way the hell above you.<br> We'd have to have an understanding.<br> Well...<br> ...if...<br> If he's as big as you say...<br> ...then when he goes down,<br> the merger will be approved.<br> Just like that?<br> We're looking for the illusion<br> of due diligence, Mr. Pope.<br> Two criminal acts<br> successfully prosecuted...<br> ...it gives us that illusion.<br> Call me Jimmy.<br> He's a visionary.

Regulatory<br> bodies scratched their heads...<br> ...that nobody at Connex or Killen<br> was at fault.<br> But this merger is so balance-positive<br> for American consumers...<br> ...that, ultimately, Justice wants it.<br> Federal courts want it.<br> Everybody wants it.<br> Our real client, after all,<br> is us, the American people.<br> And we are increasing American access<br> to oil in Kazakhstan.<br> So all they ask is that we give them<br> a little something meaningful...<br> ...which we did.<br> And they got out of our way.<br> Something besides Dalton?<br> Unfortunately, yes.<br> And the best option seemed to be...<br> ...a secret deal for excess<br> Iranian pipeline capacity...<br> ...that I uncovered during the diligence.<br> A little side deal benefiting<br> the lead lawyer...<br> ...involved in the Connex-Killen<br> merger approval process.<br> What...<br> ...do you think you're doing?<br> It's illegal for an American<br> to control these rights.<br> Stop right now.<br> Is there...<br> ...something that<br> you wanna tell me, Syd?<br> Connex/ Al-Salwa LNG loading facility<br> The Persian Gulf<br> Good afternoon.<br> I wanna thank our host<br> for a wonderful spread.<br> The strawberry juice is delicious.<br> Let me just say,<br> on behalf of Connex-Killen...<br> ...how pleased we are<br> to be back in the Gulf.<br> Your Highness?<br> Why don't you ride together.<br> Oh, thank you, Bryan.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...this year's Oilman of the Year:<br> Mr. Leland Janus of Connex-Killen.<br> Who the hell is that?<br> Excuse me.
