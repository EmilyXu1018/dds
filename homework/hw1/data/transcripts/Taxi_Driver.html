I'm gonna<br> fuck her brains out. She goes wild.<br> And she said, "It's the greatest<br> single experience of my life."<br> She gave me a $200 tip<br> and her phone number in Acapulco.<br> Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T?<br> Hey, Travis, got change for a nickel?<br> We call him Doughboy<br> 'cause he'll do anything for a buck.<br> So, how's it hanging?<br> What's that?<br> I just heard on the radio some fleet driver<br> from Bell just got all cut up.<br> - Stickup?<br> - No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.<br> - Cut half his ear off.<br> - Where?<br> They said 122nd Street.<br> Fucking Mau Mau land.<br> You run all over town, don't you?<br> Travis?<br> - You run all over town, don't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> I mean,<br> you handled some pretty rough customers.<br> Yeah, I have.<br> - You carry a piece?<br> - No.<br> - You need one?<br> - No.<br> If you ever need one, I know a fellow<br> who can get you a real nice deal.<br> Lots of shit around.<br> I never use mine. I'm conservative.<br> But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.<br> I'm gonna go do my dirt.<br> Travis.<br> Look.<br> A piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.<br> Dig the symbols.<br> "F- 4-0-5-4-3-4"<br> The watermark.<br> There's one person.<br> There's two persons,<br> and there's three persons.<br> I got this at his estate, The Pines.<br> Why don't you take it? If you can sell it,<br> you give me half of what you got.<br> I don't want it.<br> I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.<br> - I'm terribly sorry.<br> - What now?<br> - Nothing!<br> - That's very cute. Thank you.<br> Hey, you want to see something?<br> Wait. I just typed,<br> "You want to see something?"<br> - What?<br> - lf you had...<br> these three fingers missing on this hand<br> and that hand missing on that hand...<br> how would you light a match?<br> - I wouldn't light a match.<br> - Go ahead, give it a try.<br> Well, I don't think I could do it.<br> No?<br> It's gonna be difficult. I'll give it a try.<br> I got my thumb back for a second.<br> Thank God.<br> Just a minute.<br> I can't do it.<br> - The guy at the newsstand can do it.<br> - I don't work at a newsstand.<br> - He's probably Italian.<br> - No.<br> - You sure he's not Italian?<br> - He's black.<br> If he had been Italian,<br> he might have been a thief.<br> They do that.<br> The mob does that a lot of times.<br> If a thief screws up on the job,<br> they'll blow his fingers off.<br> I'll tell you something else.<br> It's like a joke, but true.<br> If they kill a stool pigeon,<br> they leave a canary on the body.<br> - Apparently it's symbolic.<br> - Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?<br> I don't know why not a pigeon.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You got to catch a pigeon.<br> A canary, you can walk into a pet store.<br> As long as you pay for it, boom.<br> Kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> - Hi. I'd like to volunteer.<br> - Great. I'll take you over here.<br> I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.<br> Why do you feel that<br> you have to volunteer to me?<br> Because I think you are<br> the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.<br> Thanks. But what do you think of Palantine?<br> Charles Palantine, the man you're<br> volunteering to help elect President.<br> I'm sure he'll make a good president.<br> I don't know his policies...<br> but I'm sure he'll make a good one.<br> - You want to canvass?<br> - I'll canvass.<br> How do you feel about<br> the Senator's stand on welfare?<br> I don't know the Senator's stand on welfare,<br> but I'm sure it's a good stand.<br> - Are you sure of that?<br> - Yeah.<br> We all work together here full-time,<br> day and night.<br> If you would step over there,<br> I'm sure the gentleman will sign you up.<br> I drive a taxi at night, so it's hard for me...<br> to work in the day.<br> Then what exactly do you want?<br> Would you like to come<br> have some coffee and pie with me?<br> Why?<br> Why? I'll tell you why.<br> I think you're a lonely person.<br> I drive by this place a lot,<br> and I see you here.<br> I see a lot of people around you...<br> and I see all these phones<br> and stuff on your desk.<br> That means nothing.<br> Then I came inside and met you...<br> I saw in your eyes,<br> I saw the way you carried yourself...<br> that you're not a happy person.<br> I think you need something.<br> If you want to call it a friend,<br> you can call it a friend.<br> - You're gonna be my friend?<br> - Yeah.<br> What do you say?<br> It's a little hard standing here<br> and asking you, so...<br> Five minutes. That's all.<br> Just outside, right around here.<br> I'm there to protect you.<br> Come on. Just take a little break.<br> I have a break at 4:00, and if you're here...<br> - 4:00 today?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'll be here.<br> - I'm sure you will.<br> - All right. 4:00 p. m?<br> - Right.<br> - Outside, in the front?<br> - Yes.<br> Okay. My name is Travis. Betsy?<br> - Travis.<br> - Yeah.<br> I appreciate this, Betsy.<br> May 26, 4:00 p.m.<br> I took Betsy to Child's Coffee Shop<br> on Columbus Circle.<br> I had black coffee and apple pie<br> with a slice of melted yellow cheese.<br> I think that was a good selection.<br> Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.<br> But she could've had anything she wanted.<br> is not bad...<br> but, Christ, the organizational problems.<br> I know what you mean.<br> I got the same problems.<br> I got to get organized.<br> You know, little things<br> like my apartment, my possessions.<br> I should get a sign saying,<br> "One of these days I'll get organezized."<br> - You mean organized?<br> - "Organeziezd."<br> Organeziezd. It's a joke.<br> O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.<br> You mean organezized<br> like those office signs that say "thimk."<br> Do you like the place you work in?<br> We've got some good people<br> working for us...<br> and I think Palantine's got a good chance.<br> You know, you have beautiful eyes.<br> - Do you like the guy you work with?<br> - He's okay.<br> Yeah, but do you like him?<br> He's funny, and he's very good at his job.<br> He's okay.<br> - Though he does have a few problems.<br> - I would say he has quite a few problems.<br> His energy seems to go in the wrong places.<br> When I walked in<br> and saw you two sitting there...<br> I could tell by the way you both related<br> there was no connection whatsoever.<br> And I felt when I walked in<br> that there was something between us.<br> There was an impulse<br> that we were both following.<br> So that gave me the right<br> to come in and talk to you.<br> Otherwise, I never would have felt<br> I had the right to talk to you...<br> or say anything to you.<br> I never would have had the courage<br> to talk to you.<br> With him, I felt there was nothing,<br> and I could sense it.<br> When I walked in, I knew I was right.<br> Did you feel that way?<br> I wouldn't be here if I didn't.<br> - Where are you from?<br> - Upstate.<br> That fellow you work with, I don't like him.<br> Not that I don't like him.<br> I just think he's silly.<br> I don't think he respects you.<br> I don't believe I've ever met anyone<br> quite like you.<br> You wanna go to a movie with me?<br> - I have to go back to work.<br> - I don't mean now. Like another time?<br> Sure. You know what you remind me of?<br> - What?<br> - That song.<br> By Kris Kristofferson.<br> - Who's that?<br> - The songwriter.<br> He's a prophet and a pusher.<br> Partly truth, partly fiction.<br> A walking contradiction.<br> - You saying that about me?<br> - Who else would I be talking about?<br> I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.<br> No, just the part about the contradictions.<br> You are that.<br> I called Betsy again at her office,<br> and she said...<br> maybe we'd go to a movie<br> after she gets off work tomorrow.<br> That's my day off. At first she hesitated.<br> But I called her again and then she agreed.<br> Betsy. No, Betsy what?<br> I forgot to ask her last name again.<br> Damn. I got to remember stuff like that.<br> I don't think we have to worry about<br> anybody here committing themselves...<br> I don't think we have to worry about<br> anybody here committing themselves...<br> until things start coming in from California.<br> This is just making me nervous.<br> We should have waited for the limo.<br> I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going<br> to California without preparing right.<br> - That's gonna get us in trouble.<br> - Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?<br> Yes, I am.<br> I'm one of your biggest supporters.<br> I tell everybody that comes in this taxi<br> that they have to vote for you.<br> Why, thank you...<br> Travis.<br> I'm sure you're gonna win, sir.<br> Everybody I know is gonna vote for you.<br> In fact, I was gonna put one<br> of your stickers in my taxi.<br> But the company said it was against<br> their policy, they don't know anything.<br> - They're a bunch of jerks.<br> - Let me tell you something...<br> I have learned more about America<br> from riding in taxi cabs...<br> than in all the limos in the country.<br> - Yeah?<br> - That's true.<br> - Can I ask you something, Travis?<br> - Sure.<br> What is the one thing about this country<br> that bugs you the most?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I don't follow political issues that closely.<br> There must be something.<br> Whatever it is,<br> you should clean up this city here...<br> because this city is like an open sewer,<br> it's full of filth and scum.<br> Sometimes I can hardly take it.<br> Whoever becomes the President<br> should just...<br> really clean it up, know what I mean?<br> Sometimes I go out and I smell it.<br> I get headaches, it's so bad.<br> It's like, they just never go away, you know.<br> The President should just<br> clean up this whole mess here.<br> He should flush it right down<br> the fucking toilet.<br> I think I know what you mean, Travis.<br> But it's not gonna be easy.<br> - We'll have to make some radical changes.<br> - Damn straight.<br> - Here you go, Travis. Keep the change.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Nice talking to you, Travis.<br> - Nice talking to you, sir.<br> You're a good man.<br> I know you're gonna win.<br> Thank you.<br> Come on, man. Get me out of here, all right?<br> Come on!<br> Come on, baby. This is a real drag.<br> Don't make no scene.<br> You wanna get busted?<br> What's up, bitch, be cool!<br> Don't start no trouble.<br> Cabbie, forget about this. It's nothing.<br> Be cool, bitch.<br> Get your ass out of here.<br> - Hi, there.<br> - Hi.<br> - Did you have a nice day today?<br> - Not particularly.<br> Got a present for you.<br> Now back to Gene Krupa's<br> syncopated style shortly.<br> Why'd you do that?<br> What else am I gonna do with my money?<br> I wish you would've listened to this.<br> I would've, except my record player<br> doesn't work now.<br> Your stereo's broken? How can you<br> stand it? I couldn't live without music.<br> I don't follow music too much.<br> But I would really like to. I really would.<br> - Then you haven't heard this record yet.<br> - No.<br> But I was thinking, maybe we could listen<br> to it on your record player.<br> Now going back to 40 years of Chick Webb.<br> - You've got to be kidding.<br> - Why?<br> This is a dirty movie.<br> No, this is a movie that...<br> a lot of couples come to,<br> all kinds of couples go here.<br> - You sure about that?<br> - Yeah, I see them all the time.<br> Come on.<br> Excuse me!<br> Shut the fuck up.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I have to leave now.<br> Why?<br> I don't know why I came in here.<br> I don't like these movies.<br> I didn't know you'd feel that way<br> about this movie.<br> - I don't know much about movies...<br> - This the only kind you go to?<br> Yeah, I come. This is not so bad.<br> Taking me to this place is about<br> as exciting as you saying, "Let's fuck."<br> There are other places,<br> plenty of other movies I can take you to.<br> I don't know much about them,<br> but I can take you to other places.<br> We're just different.<br> - Wait a second.<br> - I have to go.<br> - I've got to go now.<br> - I wanna talk to you.<br> - I have to go.<br> - Wait a second.<br> Taxi!<br> Can't I talk to you at least?<br> Won't you talk to me? I didn't know...<br> - Look, won't you take the record?<br> - I've already got it.<br> But, please. I bought it for you, Betsy.<br> Thanks. Now I've got two. Let's go.<br> Can I call you?<br> Jesus Christ. I got a taxi.<br> Hello, Betsy. Hi, it's Travis.<br> How you doing?<br> Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.<br> I didn't know that's how you felt about it.<br> I didn't know that was the way you felt.<br> I would've taken you somewhere else.<br> Are you feeling better or...<br> Maybe you had a virus or something,<br> It can happen. Yeah.<br> You've been working hard.<br> I know it's... Yeah...<br> Okay.<br> Would you like to have<br> some dinner with me...<br> in the next few days or something?<br> How about just a cup of coffee?<br> I could come by the headquarters.<br> We could...<br> Okay.<br> Did you get my flowers in the...<br> You didn't get them? I sent some flowers...<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Can I call you again tomorrow<br> or the next day?<br> Okay. No, I'm gonna... Yeah, sure, okay.<br> So long.<br> I tried several times to call her,<br> but after the first call...<br> she wouldn't come to the phone any longer.<br> I also sent flowers, but with no luck.<br> The smell of the flowers<br> only made me sicker.<br> The headaches got worse.<br> I think I got stomach cancer.<br> I shouldn't complain, though.<br> You're only as healthy...<br> You're only as healthy as you feel.<br> You're only as healthy...<br> as you feel.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Let's not have any trouble, okay?<br> What? Why won't you talk to me,<br> or answer my calls when I call?<br> - You think I don't know you're here?<br> - Let's not have trouble.<br> - Please leave.<br> - Get your hands off me.<br> - Okay, then leave.<br> - Know that I know.<br> Let's not have any trouble. Please.<br> This is no place to do this.<br> - Get your hands off me!<br> - Okay, just leave.<br> - Take them off!<br> - All right! Just leave now. Come on.<br> You're in a hell, and you're gonna die<br> in a hell like the rest of them!<br> - There's a cop across the street.<br> - You're like them.<br> I'm calling the cop. Officer!<br> Look. Don't come around here<br> because I'll call the police!<br> I realize now how much<br> she's just like the others.<br> Cold and distant.<br> And many people are like that.<br> Women for sure. They're like a union.<br> Cab!<br> Pull over to the curb over there.<br> No, don't...<br> The fucking meter. What are you doing?<br> What are you doing with the meter?<br> Did I tell you to do that with the meter?<br> Put the meter back, let the numbers go on.<br> I don't care what I have to pay.<br> I'm not getting out.<br> Put the meter back on.<br> Put it down.<br> That's right. Put it down.<br> Why are you writing?<br> Don't write! Put the thing down. Just sit.<br> I didn't tell you to write.<br> I just said, "Pull over to the curb."<br> We've pulled over to the curb.<br> We're gonna sit here.<br> We're gonna sit.<br> Cabbie, you see that light up there?<br> The window?<br> The light, the window<br> up there on the second floor.<br> The one that's closest<br> to the edge of the building.<br> The light up in the window, second story.<br> What, are you blind?<br> Do you see the light?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah, you see it. Good.<br> See the woman in the window?<br> Do you see the woman in the window?<br> Yeah.<br> You see the woman. Good.<br> I want you to see that woman<br> because that's my wife.<br> But that's not my apartment.<br> It's not my apartment.<br> You know who lives there?<br> You wouldn't know. I'm just saying...<br> But you know who lives there?<br> A nigger lives there. How do you like that?<br> I'm gonna kill her.<br> There's nothing else. I'm just gonna kill her.<br> What do you think of that?<br> I said, what do you think of that?<br> Don't answer.<br> You don't have to answer everything.<br> I'm gonna kill her with a.44 magnum pistol.<br> I have a.44 magnum pistol.<br> I'm gonna kill her with that gun.<br> Did you ever see what a.44 magnum<br> would do to a woman's face?<br> It'll fucking destroy it.<br> Just blow it right apart.<br> That's what it can do to her face.<br> Did you see what it can do<br> to a woman's pussy? That you should see.<br> You should see what a.44 magnum's<br> gonna do to a woman's pussy.<br> What's that?<br> I know you must think I'm...<br> You must think I'm pretty sick or something.<br> Right? You think I'm pretty sick?<br> Right? I bet you really think I'm sick.<br> You think I'm sick?<br> You don't have to answer that.<br> I'm paying for the ride.<br> I picked up this midget.<br> He was very well dressed.<br> Italian suit. Good-looking.<br> Had a beautiful tall blonde.<br> A lady midget?<br> No, the guy was a midget.<br> The blonde was the lady.<br> - I got it.<br> - Those midgets are funny.<br> - Sometimes I like to hold a midget.<br> - Yeah?<br> They're funny. They always want<br> to sit in the front seat.<br> Then I pick up these two fags.<br> They're going downtown.<br> They're wearing these rhinestone t-shirts.<br> They start arguing.<br> They start yelling.<br> The other says, "You bitch!"<br> And starts beating him on the head.<br> I say, "Look, I don't care what you do<br> in the privacy of your own home...<br> "behind closed doors.<br> "This is an American free country.<br> We've got a pursuit of happiness thing.<br> "You're consenting. You're adult.<br> "But in my fucking cab...<br> "don't go busting heads."<br> You know what I mean?<br> "God loves you. Do what you want."<br> Tell them to go to California.<br> In California, when two fags split up,<br> one's got to pay the other alimony.<br> Not bad. They're way ahead out there.<br> You know what I mean? California.<br> I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.<br> One time I saw a cop chasing this guy<br> with one leg. He was on crutches.<br> The cop?<br> No, the dude that he was chasing.<br> Fucking cops, they chase anything.<br> Hey, Travis. You got that five you owe me?<br> The man is loaded.<br> I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me<br> some people from Ohio at Kennedy.<br> I took them into Manhattan by way<br> of Long Beach. Tipped me $5.<br> Where's the action around?<br> It's pretty slow.<br> I'm shoving on.<br> Wait.<br> Can I talk to you for a second?<br> Bye, killer.<br> Ninety-nine.<br> You can have all you want.<br> Don't be hitting on me!<br> You better take your ass out, boy!<br> - Yeah?<br> - I know you and I ain't talked too much.<br> But I figured you've been around a lot.<br> So you could...<br> Shoot, that's why they call me the "Wizard."<br> It's just that I got a...<br> - I got a...<br> - Things got you down?<br> - Yeah.<br> - It happens to the best of us.<br> Yeah, it got me real down.<br> I just want to go out<br> and really do something.<br> Taxi life, you mean?<br> Yeah, well...<br> No, it's...<br> I don't know.<br> I just wanna go out...<br> and really...<br> I really wanna...<br> I got some bad ideas in my head. I just...<br> Look at it this way.<br> A man takes a job, you know.<br> And that job...<br> I mean, like that...<br> That becomes what he is.<br> Like...<br> you do a thing and that's what you are.<br> Like, I've been a cabbie for 17 years.<br> Ten years at night.<br> I still don't own my own cab.<br> You know why?<br> Because I don't want to.<br> That must be what I want.<br> To be on the night shift<br> driving somebody else's cab.<br> You understand?<br> I mean, you get a job, you become the job.<br> One guy lives in Brooklyn.<br> One guy lives in Sutton Place.<br> You got a lawyer. Another guy's a doctor.<br> Another guy dies. Another guy gets well.<br> People are born.<br> I envy you, your youth.<br> Go on, get laid.<br> Get drunk. Do anything.<br> Because you got no choice, anyway.<br> I mean, we're all fucked.<br> More or less.<br> I don't know. That's about<br> the dumbest thing I ever heard.<br> It's not Bertrand Russell.<br> What do you want? I'm a cabbie.<br> What do I know?<br> I don't even know<br> what the fuck you're talking about.<br> Maybe I don't know either.<br> Don't worry so much.<br> Relax, killer. You're gonna be all right.<br> I know. I've seen a lot of people, and...<br> - I know.<br> - Okay.<br> Thanks, man.<br> I guess...<br> Yeah, you're all right.<br> What do you think of your opponent's<br> chances in the up and coming primary?<br> Mr. Goodwin is a fine man.<br> I would certainly,<br> if it came to it, prefer him...<br> to our opponent in the other party.<br> I think that my programs<br> are better defined than his.<br> They're more imaginative,<br> and I have a better chance of winning.<br> I think it's academic, though, because<br> he's not gonna win the primary. I am.<br> One more thing I'd like to ask,<br> and that's about your campaign.<br> How do you feel your campaign's going?<br> When we came up with our slogan,<br> "We are the people"...<br> when I said, "Let the people rule"...<br> I felt I was being<br> somewhat overly optimistic.<br> I must tell you that I'm more optimistic<br> now than ever before.<br> The people are rising to the demands<br> that I have made on them.<br> The people are beginning to rule.<br> I feel it as the crowds swell.<br> I know it will continue through the primary,<br> it will continue in Miami...<br> and I know it will rise<br> to an unprecedented swell in November.<br> Bitch, goddamn! I'll blow her face off!<br> I'll kill her, god damn it!<br> Damn! If I get my hands on her,<br> I'll kill her! Goddamn motherfucker!<br> I swear I'll kill that fucking bitch!<br> If I get my hands on her, I'll kill her!<br> Hey, Sport.<br> I'll kill her! Damn it!<br> - This guy keeps following.<br> - Don't look at him.<br> Hey, guys.<br> - You wanna take a walk?<br> - Yeah.<br> Loneliness has followed me<br> my whole life, everywhere.<br> In bars, in cars.<br> Sidewalks, stores, everywhere.<br> There's no escape.<br> I'm God's lonely man.<br> June 8.<br> My life has taken another turn again.<br> The days move along with regularity,<br> over and over.<br> One day indistinguishable from the next.<br> A long continuous chain.<br> Then suddenly...<br> there is change.<br> Hey, Travis, this here's Easy Andy.<br> He's a traveling salesman.<br> How you doing, Travis?<br> - You got a.44 magnum?<br> - It's an expensive weapon.<br> That's all right. I got money.<br> It's a real monster.<br> It will stop a car at 100 yards.<br> Put a round right through the engine block.<br> Here you go.<br> It's a premium, high-resale weapon.<br> Look at that.<br> That's a beauty.<br> I could sell this gun<br> to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.<br> But I deal high quality goods<br> to the right people.<br> How about that?<br> This might be a little too big<br> for practical purposes.<br> In which case for you, I'd recommend...<br> .38 snub-nose.<br> Look at this.<br> Look at that. That's a beautiful little gun.<br> It's nickel-plated, snub-nose.<br> Otherwise the same as a service revolver.<br> That'll stop anything that moves.<br> A magnum, they use that in Africa<br> for killing elephants.<br> That.38, that's a fine gun.<br> Some of these guns are like toys.<br> That.38...<br> you go and hammer nails with it all day...<br> come back and it'll cut dead center<br> on target every time.<br> It's got a really nice action to it<br> and a heck of a wallop.<br> You interested in an automatic?<br> It's a colt.25 automatic. It's a nice little gun.<br> It's a beautiful little gun. Holds six shots<br> in the clip, one shot in the chamber.<br> That's if you're dumb enough<br> to put a round in the chamber.<br> Here, look at this. A.380 Walther.<br> Holds eight shots in the clip.<br> That's a nice gun.<br> That's a beautiful little gun. Look at that.<br> During World War II,<br> they used this gun to replace the P-38.<br> Just given out to officers.<br> Isn't that a little honey?<br> - How much for everything?<br> - All together.<br> Only a jackass would carry that cannon<br> in the streets like that. Here.<br> Here's a beautiful handmade holster<br> I had made in Mexico.<br> $40.<br> $350 for the magnum, $250 for the.38...<br> $125 for the.25, $150 for the.380.<br> You take this and wait here.<br> I'll walk down with you.<br> How about dope? Grass, hash, coke...<br> mescaline, downers, Nembutal,<br> toluol, chloral hydrates?<br> - How about uppers, amphetamines?<br> - I'm not interested in that stuff.<br> I can get you crystal meth, nitrous oxide.<br> I can get you a brand-new Cadillac<br> with a pink slip for $2,000.<br> June 29.<br> I got to get in shape now.<br> Too much sitting has ruined my body.<br> Too much abuse has gone on for too long.<br> From now on it'll be 50 pushups<br> each morning, 50 pull-ups.<br> There will be no more pills, no more<br> bad food, no more destroyers of my body.<br> From now on it'll be total organization.<br> Every muscle must be tight.<br> Look at the size of that. Oh, yeah.<br> It looks so good.<br> It's getting harder and harder.<br> It's throbbing now.<br> The idea had been growing in my brain<br> for some time.<br> True force. All the king's men<br> cannot put it back together again.<br> Where do get more of these?<br> Where do you think?<br> Back at the headquarters.<br> Go all the way back there to get to town.<br> - Come on.<br> - All right. It'll work.<br> - Maybe it's the speakers.<br> - It's not. I've done this 100 times.<br> - You've done this before?<br> - Yes. Don't worry.<br> - When was the last time?<br> - I've never done this before.<br> Betsy?<br> What?<br> Betsy. Come here.<br> You're a Secret Service man, aren't you?<br> Just waiting for the Senator.<br> You're waiting for the Senator?<br> That's a very good answer.<br> Shit, man.<br> I'm waiting for the sun to shine.<br> Yeah.<br> No. The reason I asked<br> if you were a Secret Service man...<br> I won't say anything, because I...<br> I saw some suspicious looking people<br> over there.<br> - You did?<br> - They were right over there.<br> They were just here. I...<br> They were very, very...<br> - Suspicious?<br> - Yeah.<br> Where'd they go?<br> Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?<br> Why?<br> I was just curious,<br> 'cause I think I'd be good at it.<br> I'm very observant.<br> I was in the Marine Corps.<br> I'm good with crowds.<br> I notice there's a little pin there.<br> That's like a signal, isn't it?<br> - Sort of.<br> - Signal.<br> A secret signal for the Secret Service.<br> What kind of guns you guys carry?<br> .38s?.45s?.357 magnums?<br> Something bigger maybe?<br> Look, if you're really interested,<br> if you give me your name and address...<br> we'll send you all the information<br> on how to apply. How's that?<br> - You will?<br> - Sure.<br> Okay.<br> Why not?<br> My name is Henry...<br> Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.<br> - Hopper.<br> - Yeah.<br> Like a rabbit. Hip, hop.<br> Fairlawn, New Jersey.<br> - Is there a zip code with that, Henry?<br> - Yeah. 610452.<br> - Okay.<br> - That's six digits.<br> Okay.<br> I was thinking of my telephone number.<br> I've got it all, Henry,<br> we'll get all the stuff right out to you.<br> Thanks a lot. Great. Hell. Jesus.<br> - Be careful today.<br> - Right. Will do.<br> You have to be careful<br> living around a place like this.<br> Bye.<br> Damn it.<br> Faster than you, you fucking son of a...<br> I saw you coming, you fucking shit-heel.<br> I'm standing here. You make the move.<br> It's your move.<br> Don't try it, you fuck.<br> You talking to me?<br> Then who the hell else are you talking to?<br> You talking to me?<br> I'm the only one here.<br> Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Okay.<br> Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.<br> Here is a man<br> who would not take it anymore.<br> Who would not let...<br> Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.<br> Here is a man<br> who would not take it anymore.<br> A man who stood up against the scum,<br> the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.<br> Here is someone who stood up.<br> Here is...<br> You're dead.<br> Yeah, man?<br> Shut your mouth. Give me the cash<br> out of the drawer. Come on.<br> Let's go. Give me the goddamn cash.<br> - Don't shoot. I'm getting it.<br> - Stop taking so long. Come on.<br> Let me have it. Give me the bread.<br> - This all you got? Get the rest.<br> - That's it.<br> - I don't have any more.<br> - Give me the rest of the cash.<br> - That's all I got.<br> - Give me more.<br> - I got no money.<br> - Reach in your sock. You got more bread.<br> - That's it, man.<br> - Give me the rest of the fucking bread.<br> - Did you get him?<br> - Yeah, I got him.<br> Shit, man.<br> - Is he dead?<br> - I don't know. His eyes are moving.<br> Listen, I ain't got a permit for this thing.<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<br> Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.<br> - Can I give you some money?<br> - No. Just get out of here.<br> No, man. I'll take care of it. Go ahead.<br> That's the fifth motherfucker this year.<br> You wanna buy that little dope?<br> Walt Whitman, that great American poet...<br> spoke for all of us when he said:<br> "I am the man. I suffered. I was there."<br> Today I say to you, we are the people.<br> We suffered. We were there.<br> We, the people, suffered in Vietnam.<br> We, the people, suffered,<br> we still suffer from unemployment...<br> inflation, crime and corruption.<br> "Dear Father and Mother.<br> "July is the month I remember<br> which brings...<br> "not only your wedding anniversary...<br> "but also Father's Day<br> and Mother's birthday.<br> "I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates...<br> "but I hope this card<br> will take care of them all.<br> "I'm sorry again<br> I cannot send you my address...<br> "like I promised to last year.<br> "But the sensitive nature of my work<br> for the government...<br> "demands utmost secrecy.<br> "I know you will understand."<br> We are, all of us...<br> "I am healthy and well,<br> and making lots of money.<br> "I have been going with a girl<br> for several months...<br> "and I know you would be proud<br> if you could see her.<br> "Here name is Betsy,<br> but I can tell you no more than that."<br> Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.<br> Come on, let's go.
