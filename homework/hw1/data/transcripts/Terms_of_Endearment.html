I know.<br> - Here it starts. Here we go.<br> Rudyard... Rudyard, she's not breathing.<br> Honey, she's sleeping.<br> The baby's sleeping.<br> No.<br> Rudyard, it's crib death.<br> It's sleep! She's asleep, honey.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Come on!<br> (EMMA MURMURS)<br> Emma!<br> (EMMA WHIMPERS)<br> - Oh, good.<br> - (EMMA CRIES)<br> That's better.<br> No, thank you.<br> - Thanks. Emma?<br> - Glad to help.<br> He was one of the most dependable<br> men that ever worked for me.<br> - I know. Thank you.<br> - He was a good man.<br> Hey, I'm real sorry about your daddy.<br> Take care of your momma.<br> Emma. Emma, wake up, please.<br> - Wake up.<br> - What's wrong?<br> I was tense. I was tense, and I was<br> wondering how you were feeling.<br> - Would you like to sleep in my bed?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Would you like<br> to sleep in my bed again?<br> Yes!<br> What are we gonna do with this hair?<br> PATSY: Hey, Emma.<br> Patsy, hurry up!<br> You're going to miss him.<br> That's what they were looking at!<br> (LAUGHS)<br> - Good night, honey.<br> - Where's Momma?<br> She's out back with that old fart<br> who's trying to get in her pants.<br> Aren't you gonna wait and see<br> if the astronaut shows up?<br> They've got one on every corner<br> in Houston!<br> Come on. I gotta get my bus.<br> - Okay. Say hi to Race for me.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - Love you. Astronauts!<br> - So?<br> - We better get going.<br> I'm gonna say goodbye to my mother.<br> You want to go with?<br> No. I don't think I'm up to it today.<br> Sure would be nice<br> to have a mother somebody liked.<br> Why don't you face up to the fact<br> that you have certain biological needs?<br> - Because I don't.<br> - EMMA: Mom! I'm going now.<br> Excuse me.<br> (CHUCKLES) Can you believe it?<br> He wants to take me to Tahiti.<br> (SCOFFS)<br> I don't know why you treat these men<br> like this. They have feelings, too. Ouch.<br> You always make so much of things.<br> - Has the astronaut moved in yet?<br> - Ow! Who?<br> "Who?"<br> Is Patsy teaching you coy lessons?<br> Breedlove, Garrett. Next door.<br> Has he moved in?<br> - Put your socks up!<br> - All right. Come say goodbye to Patsy.<br> and no later than 11:00.<br> Say goodbye to Patsy.<br> - Goodbye, Patsy!<br> - Thank you.<br> PATSY: Goodbye, Mrs Greenway.<br> (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY<br> ON RECORDING)<br> EMMA: (SPEAKING WITH RECORDING)<br> In this day and age, anything goes!<br> (SINGING ALONG TO<br> ANYTHING GOES)<br> I feel really foolish getting stoned<br> to hear Mary Martin.<br> See, Patsy,<br> this is not Mary Martin.<br> This is Ethel Merman.<br> This is the last time<br> we're gonna be like this.<br> I just plain refuse<br> to get into that kind of thinking, Patsy.<br> It should not stop.<br> I mean, we're gonna be best friends.<br> Our babies are gonna be best friends.<br> We're all gonna grow up<br> and be best friends.<br> (KNOCKING AT DOOR)<br> - Emma?<br> - EMMA: Oh, God!<br> - Just a minute, Ma.<br> - AURORA: Open the door.<br> - Emma?<br> - Yes.<br> - Open the door, please.<br> - Just a minute, Ma.<br> What do you mean?<br> - Emma, I need to talk to you!<br> - All right.<br> I'm getting married.

Maybe she's going to<br> tell you how to have sex.<br> (CHUCKLING) What? No.<br> She only knows how to avoid it.<br> (BOTH LAUGH)<br> - Okay, hang on.<br> - I can't believe you just said that.<br> I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, I swear.<br> AURORA: What have you<br> been doing, Emma?<br> Nothing.<br> What is it, Momma?<br> I really would like to get some sleep<br> so I could look halfway decent<br> for tomorrow.<br> Come on. What is it?<br> You wouldn't want me to be silent about<br> something that's for your own good,<br> even if it might hurt a little, would you?<br> Yes, ma'am, I certainly would!<br> (LAUGHING)<br> (CONTINUES LAUGHING)<br> Okay, come on.<br> Come on.<br> I've been in here all night.<br> I've been trying to decide<br> what wedding gift to get you.<br> I thought of that Renoir<br> that my mother gave me.<br> But I couldn't reach a conclusion.<br> Then I came to grips with the reason<br> why I couldn't think<br> of a wedding gift for you.<br> Momma, it's all right.<br> I need dishes of any kind, CorningWare,<br> a rotisserie, the car, a house.<br> Emma.<br> I'm totally convinced<br> if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow,<br> it will be a mistake<br> of such gigantic proportions,<br> it will ruin your life<br> and make wretched your destiny.<br> Why are you doing this to me?<br> You are not special enough<br> to overcome a bad marriage.<br> Emma, use your brains.<br> Flap is limited.<br> He hasn't got any imagination.<br> Even at this age,<br> all he wants is a secure teaching job.<br> Mother,<br> I'm marrying Flap Horton tomorrow.<br> I thank God for Flap<br> for getting me out of here.<br> And if this is your attitude, you shouldn't<br> bother showing up to my wedding.<br> Hmm.<br> That's right. No, I think you're right.<br> The hypocrisy was bothering me, too.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> My own mother's<br> not coming to my wedding.<br> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<br> (CONTINUES RINGING)<br> (EMMA LAUGHING)<br> (SNEEZES)<br> (SNIFFLES)<br> (RINGING CONTINUES)<br> Listen to her. She's going crazy.<br> I'll give her until noon tomorrow.<br> That's about all she can take.<br> Emma, your mother<br> boycotted your wedding,<br> she hates your husband,<br> and she only holds you<br> in medium esteem.<br> Medium esteem.<br> That is so cute. That is so cute.<br> (RINGING CONTINUES)<br> Wouldn't it have been strange if one<br> of us married a person who didn't read?<br> God, there's millions of<br> interesting people out there<br> who just never pick up a book.<br> (RINGING STOPS)<br> Flap, I feel so totally good about us.<br> I hope I get pregnant tonight.<br> That would be nice.<br> (SNEEZES)<br> Emma.<br> I love the way you look.<br> You're so nice.<br> You're my sweet-ass gal.<br> Oh!<br> (LAUGHS)<br> (SNEEZES)<br> (EMMA LAUGHING)<br> EMMA: (LAUGHING)<br> Here comes the bride!<br> EMMA: How do you... Yeah.<br> FLAP: Hmm.<br> Wait, Flap.<br> Where did you learn how to do that?<br> FLAP: Quit moving.<br> EMMA: Flap?<br> (GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE PLAYING)<br> That is the strangest music<br> to make love to.<br> I know.<br> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<br> Leave me alone. I don't want<br> to talk to you right now. I'm happy.<br> I don't want to talk to you.<br> No. Did you see<br> the tablecloth Rosie gave me?<br> It's beautiful. It's got red flowers on it.<br> Yeah. I think she made it.<br> No. No, not yet.<br> No, I made omelettes.<br> I started 'em. Kind of Tex-Mex.<br> No. That was the worst thing you've<br> ever done to me in my life, Mother!<br> Well, I think you owe my husband<br> an apology.<br> Until you apologise to my husband,<br> I'm not listening to any of your gossip.<br> No. Well, he's right here.<br> (FLAP MOUTHING)<br> Hold on.<br> - Yes.<br> - No.<br> - Yes.<br> - No. No.<br> Yes.<br> Hello, Mrs Greenway.<br> No, ma'am,<br> I am not enjoying your predicament.<br> Momma, you be nice. I swear.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I don't need or desire an apology.<br> All I want is for you to understand<br> and appreciate my position,<br> to respect our marriage,<br> and to maybe wait another 15 minutes<br> before you call in the morning.<br> Yes, I guess I've said my piece.<br> Okay, I'll put her on.<br> He's so great! I told you.<br> I'll talk to you later. All right?<br> (I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE<br> PLAYING OUTSIDE)<br> GARRETT: I don't care about<br> the neighbourhood.<br> Can't you stay a little while longer?<br> I thought we were having<br> a real good time, didn't you?<br> Listen, don't go yet.<br> One more minute. No, I've got<br> something I want to show you.<br> No, really.<br> (CAR ENGINES STARTING)<br> - Thanks.<br> - Good night.<br> Oops!<br> (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)<br> - I bought you something.<br> - What?<br> A tie.<br> Emma.<br> You didn't buy this tie for me.<br> You were worried about<br> how I was gonna look to your mother.<br> Now I wish you would stop being<br> such a quisling where she is concerned.<br> Why is it every time I get happy,<br> you turn perverse?<br> - Buying this tie made you happy?<br> - Yes! Yes!<br> I wish you could understand this,<br> 'cause you really don't.<br> I mean, it made me very happy,<br> buying this tie.<br> I went to two or three places<br> before I finally found the right place.<br> And then describing your jacket<br> to the salesman<br> and knowing how perfect it would match<br> with what you were wearing,<br> which, by the way, it certainly does.<br> I mean, it was fun!<br> It was a goddamn Mardi Gras,<br> and you're just too dumb<br> to understand that kind of happiness!<br> I'm sorry. I'm being terrible.<br> Going to your mother's,<br> it makes me a little irrational.<br> - Can I help?<br> - Yes. Thank you, Flap.<br> Would you take this candle to Emma?<br> I need another one.<br> - In the kitchen?<br> - Yes.<br> That looks great.<br> Who's that short gentleman?<br> Not that it's any of your business, but...<br> Just leave it at that.<br> What are you looking at?<br> She isn't there any more.<br> She'll be back.<br> I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.<br> Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.<br> God, isn't she something?<br> Here she comes.<br> I met her two weeks ago at church.<br> I guess you might say<br> she's God's gift to Vernon Dahlart.<br> - Then you like her?<br> - Oh, no. Does it show?<br> (VERNON CHUCKLES)<br> Good food.<br> Well, this is what I used to serve<br> when I lived in Boston.<br> Vernon, you haven't said a word.<br> Is that right? I feel like I haven't<br> stopped talking since I came in.<br> I guess because<br> I've been thinking about you so much.<br> Can I give you a suggestion<br> on how to handle me, Vernon?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Don't worship me until I've earned it.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> I appreciate any advice you can give me.<br> - Don't talk with your mouth full, Vernon.<br> - Oh!<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> VERNON: I wouldn't do that, really.<br> I just did it to make you laugh.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> - I got some good news.<br> - What's that?<br> I'm unofficially pregnant.<br> We haven't gotten the tests back yet,<br> but you know me. I'm never late.<br> Well...<br> I don't understand.<br> Um...<br> If you're not happy for me...<br> I'm gonna get so mad<br> if you're not happy.<br> (SCOFFS)<br> Why should I?<br> (SHOUTING) Why should I be happy<br> about being a grandmother?<br> Does this mean you won't be<br> knitting the baby any booties?<br> (GUESTS LAUGH)<br> Flap.<br> Every time you get more<br> than two drinks in you, you confront me.<br> And I won't have it. I won't have it,<br> not in this house. Excuse me.<br> (GARRETT MUMBLES)<br> Do you need some help?<br> No. I'll be fine<br> just as soon as I stretch my legs.<br> AURORA: Oh, God.<br> DORIS: Mr Breedlove.<br> You're bleeding.<br> Yeah.<br> It's okay.<br> - Come on in.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - What are you afraid of, Doris?<br> - Afraid?<br> Well, why not...<br> Why not come on in then?<br> Because you're much older<br> than the boys I date,<br> 'cause you're drunk,<br> and because when I went there tonight<br> to see a United States astronaut<br> give a lecture,<br> I didn't expect him<br> to prowl after us all night long.<br> I didn't expect some silly flirt<br> who had to keep his jacket open<br> because his belly's getting too big.<br> (GRUMBLES)<br> I expected a hero.<br> (MUMBLES)<br> Well, okay, Doris, don't come in.<br> I don't want you in my house.<br> Lee Anne, would you like to come in?<br> You better tend to that cut.<br> Tommy, show me your belly.<br> Come on. Come on!<br> How can you let him run around<br> dressed like that?<br> He's adorable. Look at him.<br> EMMA: (PLAYFULLY) Uh-oh!<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> Uh-oh!<br> Great, Tommy.<br> Uh-oh!<br> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<br> That's Vernon, I'm sure.<br> So tell him that I'm...<br> Out?<br> No. Tell him I'm resting.<br> Hello? Hi, Flap.<br> Where? No. Tell me now.<br> I want to know now.<br> Oh, Flap, you did not<br> expect I'd be happy.<br> Let's be honest with each other<br> before we start pretending.<br> Um...<br> Look, Mom's staring at me right now,<br> so can I talk about it later to you?<br> Yeah. All right. Bye.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> How long you going to<br> keep this a secret?<br> The only school that would accept Flap<br> for his associate professorship<br> is in Des Moines.<br> He can't even do the simple things,<br> like fail locally.<br> It's gonna be fine, Momma.<br> It's Des Moines.<br> FLAP: Say, "Bye bye, house."<br> TOMMY: Bye bye, house.<br> FLAP: All right.<br> (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)<br> Be careful going down these steps.<br> I don't want you to break your leg.<br> Come here.<br> Come here. Come here.<br> Oh!<br> ROSIE: Stay sweet, honey.<br> Rosie.<br> That's enough, Rosie.<br> They have to get started.<br> You tell Momma to drive you home<br> when you work late.<br> Have some fun, Rosie.<br> Don't act so brave. I know you're gonna<br> go crazy without me to nag.<br> You be good to her,<br> or else we're gonna get you.<br> - I mean it.<br> - (CHUCKLES)<br> Bye, Flap.

He ran it.<br> (PANTING LIGHTLY)<br> Hi.<br> I was doing laps when you called.<br> Lucky for us, I only did eight.<br> This is it. This is the Renoir.<br> I like it.<br> I like the painting.<br> I like everything in here.<br> Relax, baby...<br> Now, just who do you think<br> you're talking to like this?<br> Don't you realise I'm a grandmother?<br> It's not flattering to look too surprised.<br> I'll just be a minute.<br> - I like the lights on.<br> - Then go home and turn them on.<br> I'm sorry.<br> (BOTH CHUCKLE)<br> Come on.<br> Dad. Come on. Wake up, Dad.<br> - What? What?<br> - Melanie's sick.<br> - What?<br> - Melanie's sick.<br> - The baby's sick.<br> - The baby's sick?<br> Are you coming, Flap?<br> TEDDY: See, Mom, see?<br> See. What do you think is wrong?<br> EMMA: I have to look first.<br> (MELANIE CRYING)<br> Come on, Dad.<br> (CRYING LOUDLY)<br> Thank you.<br> You can go to bed.<br> She's gonna be all right. She is. Go on.<br> - I couldn't sleep. So why can't I stay up?<br> - Go to bed. I'll be there soon.<br> It's bad enough<br> we're making this a drama.<br> It's not going to qualify as high drama.<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm sure it's the croup.<br> Remember? Tommy had it twice.<br> (MELANIE COUGHING)<br> - Guess you were in the library.<br> - (CRYING RESUMES)<br> Oh.<br> (MELANIE COUGHING)<br> That's the worst sound in the world.<br> FLAP: How long do you<br> keep her in here?<br> Why? Are you going back to bed?<br> I just asked how long.<br> I don't know.<br> Until her throat clears, or I lose<br> I don't know. About 20 minutes, I guess.<br> I've been offered a job.<br> What? Why didn't you say something?<br> I just wanted to think about it.<br> It's head of the English Department<br> at Kearney State College.<br> It's for about the same money.<br> Oh.<br> - Where is it?<br> - Nebraska.<br> Ooh.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> I really don't want to move from here.<br> I love the school, the paediatricians...<br> It's the head of the department.<br> (FUSSING)<br> We'll talk about it, all right?<br> I like it here, Flap.<br> Head of the department, that's...<br> That's great.<br> (SIGHS)<br> - Goodbye, Mom.<br> - Bye.<br> Come on, Teddy.<br> Don't kiss the baby.<br> She may still be sick.<br> Have a good day at school.<br> Oh! You don't know the night I had!<br> Melanie decided to get the croup,<br> and of course, it happened at 3:00 a.m.,<br> so I don't think<br> I've even gotten any sleep yet.<br> Anyway, I don't know if he's kidding.<br> Flap told me that he's taking us<br> to some college in Nebraska.<br> And I'm not sure,<br> but I think Sam is becoming<br> someone that I need in a strange way.<br> (WHISPERING) I'm lying here<br> next to the astronaut.<br> Are you really?<br> (LAUGHS)<br> How was it?<br> I'll speak to you later.<br> I'll let you go. Oh, I feel so good for you.<br> I do. You call me<br> as soon as you can. Okay?<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> (LAUGHS)<br> Mel.<br> Okay, Mel!<br> GARRETT: I just want to<br> make this clear, you know.<br> I see other women.<br> I didn't exactly think we were engaged.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> - Your ego, really!<br> Okay. Let's stay in tonight.<br> - Boy, you're saving a fortune on me.<br> - I'll cook.<br> It's been three weeks,<br> and you haven't even seen my house.<br> My best instincts had me avoiding it.<br> What are you thinking?<br> Oh...<br> I'll tell you what.<br> I think this is really sad,<br> that you feel that you need<br> all this stuff to impress girls with.<br> Need it?<br> Sometimes it isn't enough.<br> I don't think there's anything wrong<br> with using all your assets.<br> Except, you see, I think that<br> it turns your profession into a sex trap.<br> Come on. Everybody uses<br> whatever they have. I earned it!<br> There's 106 astronauts in the whole<br> fucking world, and I'm one of them!<br> It's as much a part of me<br> as anything else.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't...<br> I didn't mean to trip<br> on such a deeply felt principle.<br> GARRETT: Do you want to<br> know what bothers me?<br> None of us ever got together<br> in one room, locked all the doors,<br> and compared notes on the experience.<br> I think there was a rule we had to<br> pretend that it wasn't the fun that it was.<br> You do sense the speed.<br> I remember looking out<br> the window of the spacecraft.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> God, I sound like somebody with<br> a big belly telling stories about Korea.<br> Anyway, this one time,<br> I'm looking out the window.<br> I see a piece of the spacecraft,<br> and it's whistling along the ground.<br> It doesn't make a sound.<br> The only sound you hear,<br> the only noise in the entire world<br> is your heart beating.<br> Ah.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> (SIGHS) It's indescribable.<br> Anyway, I can't think of a better way<br> of saying it, but that was it.<br> That was my moment,<br> the one that doesn't go away.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Yes.<br> Mmm.<br> Hey.<br> This is my moment.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> (LAUGHING)<br> No, don't get nervous, Garrett.<br> (BOTH LAUGHING)<br> (COUGHING)<br> Flap?<br> Anybody?<br> (STUDENTS CHATTERING)<br> (WHISTLING)<br> WOMAN: You don't think it's love<br> because we're having fun.<br> Love can be fun.<br> Would you stop making faces?<br> (FLAP LAUGHS)<br> (WOMAN LAUGHS)<br> That's wonderful.<br> FLAP: I think what we have here<br> is a typical grad school girl crush.<br> Would you please, please, please<br> stop telling me that this is just a crush?<br> Janice, the whole fun<br> with getting involved<br> with someone who is unavailable<br> and a little bit older is that<br> sometimes you get to<br> hear what's really going on.<br> - Flap, you are such a...<br> - Incredible asshole!<br> (COOS)<br> (STAMMERS)<br> Excuse me.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - MAN: Watch it, buddy!<br> Emma.<br> God damn it, Emma.<br> You're gonna ruin us!<br> - 'Cause you're a spectacle!<br> - I am not!<br> Stop jiggling her like that.<br> She's gonna throw up.<br> Your timing was perfect.<br> You caught us before we did anything.<br> I'm taking the car,<br> and I'm gonna take the kids.<br> I'm gonna go to Houston.<br> Give me the baby.<br> You don't know what I did.<br> You don't know.<br> Just like I don't know what you do<br> on your little afternoon drives.<br> Take the...<br> STUDENT: Professor Horton,<br> can I speak to you about my grade?<br> You ought to be happy that I'm going off.<br> If I stayed here, I'd make life hell for you.<br> Don't follow me.<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> (HONKING HORN)<br> It's them. It's them!<br> (WOMEN LAUGHING)<br> - Garrett, you're gonna meet Emma.<br> - No, you don't need outsiders.<br> - You're no outsider!<br> - I'll see them later.<br> Please, come with me.<br> Em, Em, this is Garrett.<br> Oh!<br> - The one...<br> - Pleasure to meet you.<br> I've heard so much about you.<br> Your mother's really been<br> looking forward to this, too.<br> So, go ahead.<br> - Anything wrong, Garrett?<br> - No.<br> It was very nice to have met you.<br> Must be nice to be home, huh?<br> Oh, it's great. It's great.<br> I'll be over later.<br> They're probably tired anyway<br> and will get to sleep early,<br> and I'd like to get to bed early.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> TEDDY: Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!<br> Come on. Bye-bye.<br> ROSIE: Come on out. All right.<br> Whoa! This one likes to squeeze.<br> Teddy likes to squeeze.<br> Tommy likes a squeeze.<br> You both get a squeeze. And...<br> The baby. Where's the baby?<br> Oh!<br> There is my baby.<br> Look at the baby!<br> Oh!<br> EMMA: I keep thinking<br> she looks a little like you.<br> A little? It's like looking in the mirror.<br> EMMA: She loved the ride.<br> She hardly cried at all.<br> - Mmm!<br> - (BABBLING)<br> - Bring in the suitcases.<br> - Okay.<br> - Mom.<br> - Well, I talk to you every day.<br> (MELANIE BABBLING)<br> - Mother, you look great.<br> - And you look terrible.<br> Nobody wants a girl who's washed-out<br> and tired-looking all the time.<br> I just drove about 1,000 miles.<br> Besides, all the men<br> love me the way I am, Mother.<br> It's just like you that when you finally<br> take one small step away from Flap,<br> it's with a married,<br> unavailable, older lowan.<br> - Tell me about the astronaut.<br> - We have to talk about it.<br> Are you going to sleep now,<br> or are we gonna talk?<br> How's the astronaut, Mother?<br> - Really?<br> - (LAUGHING)<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Yes!<br> - He has a name, though.<br> - You really like him.<br> Yeah.<br> (LAUGHING)<br> Well, it's just so...<br> It's so strange that relatively...<br> Relatively late in life,<br> I've found that sex is so...<br> So... So...<br> So...<br> So fan-fucking-tastic!<br> Anyway, that's what he calls it.<br> (BOTH LAUGHING)<br> (EMMA SIGHS)<br> A moth to flame.<br> This affair is going to kill me.<br> No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?<br> Come on, Mom.<br> (VOICE BREAKING) I never thought<br> I'd start to need him.<br> Oh.<br> You're so lucky you have a pool.<br> Come on. Stand there. Just stand there!<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Let's talk about Los Angeles.<br> Do you miss it?<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> (TELEPHONE RINGING)<br> It was so interesting<br> dating Jews after the divorce.<br> - They are so lively.<br> - Really?<br> Yeah.<br> In Los Angeles, they were so anxious<br> to make you feel<br> as if they understood your secret<br> thoughts better than anybody.<br> WOMAN: Patsy!<br> And I was just glad I had some.<br> Honey, there's a telephone call for you.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, hi, Flap. How are you?<br> I'm fine.<br> - I guess I look older, like everyone else.<br> - She does not.<br> Flap, you sound the same, and I'm not<br> sure that's such a good thing.<br> (LAUGHS)<br> Yeah, she's right here.<br> No, we have not. We have other things<br> to talk about besides you.<br> (LAUGHS)<br> Hello.<br> I'm fine.<br> What's up? Feeling contrite?<br> You don't seem to understand, Flap.<br> I saw you together.<br> What?<br> You know, Flap, I can't believe<br> you're doing this to us.<br> (VOICE BREAKING)<br> Well, I think you're spiteful,<br> and I don't know<br> when the hell that happened.<br> No! Goodbye. I'll... Goodbye.<br> (SOBBING)<br> Flap accepted the job<br> at Kearney, Nebraska.<br> I gotta go back.<br> We're gonna move in a week.<br> Emma, I don't know why<br> you don't leave him.<br> Honestly, I don't know, either. He's cute.<br> I've been packing for us all week.<br> - Sure remembers her daddy.<br> - Yeah.<br> So, are you gonna stay mad?<br> I think being uprooted with my kids<br> without my consent<br> is at least worth a pout, don't you?<br> Come on.<br> - Head of the department.<br> - I know. I know.<br> Here.<br> - Aurora?<br> - Garrett! I'm back here.<br> Well, hello, stranger.<br> What's it been, about two days?<br> GARRETT: Your family still around?<br> No, they left.<br> What?<br> You probably know<br> what I'm going to say.<br> Maybe not. I hope not.<br> Well...<br> You're some kind of woman,<br> but I'm the wrong kind of man,<br> and it doesn't look like my shot<br> at being the right kind is<br> as good as I was hoping for.<br> You don't even know<br> how much you're gonna miss me.<br> I don't want to blow smoke up your ass.<br> Oh.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> What a relief.<br> It's just that I'm starting<br> to feel an obligation here.<br> And it makes it rough,<br> especially living next door.<br> I'm starting to think<br> I gotta watch what I'm doing...<br> Blah, blah, blah, blah...<br> (MOUTHING)<br> I am gonna miss you.<br> And I do feel bad.<br> You're lucky.<br> I feel humiliated.<br> Can I have a picture of you?<br> Well, yeah, but the only one I have<br> has Flap in it.<br> I don't mind.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> Come here. Give me a kiss.<br> When you finish this, I need this<br> kind of type or something close.<br> - Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.<br> - Hi.<br> She wanted her daddy<br> to see her dressed up<br> before she went to the doctor.<br> He'll be here any minute.<br> - I'll talk to you later.<br> - Okay.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Miss?<br> - Miss?<br> Don't make me run after you.<br> I have a toddler here!<br> (GRUNTS)<br> Are you the reason<br> that we came to Nebraska?<br> I think that Flap should talk to you.<br> We discussed that.<br> I don't want to say anything<br> until he does, except that<br> I don't think there's an emotion<br> that you're having I couldn't validate.<br> (SCOFFS)<br> Tell you what.<br> If you see Flap,<br> you tell him that his wife and his baby<br> went to the doctor's<br> to get their flu shots, all right?<br> Why don't you do that?<br> DR BUDGE: Just hold still.<br> - That's a good girl.<br> - Ow!<br> EMMA: Okay? You're all finished,<br> all right? It's all over.<br> If it makes you feel any better,<br> Mommy's gonna get a shot, too.<br> - Can I give her one of those?<br> - Sure.<br> - Here.<br> - There you go.<br> Are they gonna tell me in the other room<br> if my husband calls?<br> You have a lump in your armpit.<br> - How long has it been there?<br> - I don't know.<br> Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!<br> There's two of them.<br> It's not very big, though.<br> I have to be out of town next week,<br> and I hate to make it wait that long.<br> They should come out and be looked at.<br> Come out? Should I be scared?<br> All it means is, if you're scared, why,<br> you'll be that much happier<br> when it turns out to be nothing.<br> Dr Budge, Mom should get a pop, too,<br> for her shot.<br> - (CHUCKLING) Right. Here, Mom.<br> - Thanks, Mel.<br> Well, I know what it is.<br> You don't know how to keep yourself up,<br> so your sweat glands have clogged up.<br> - It's a cyst.<br> - So I shouldn't worry, right?<br> It's a cyst.<br> It's right where your oil glands are,<br> and they've clogged up.<br> You never did know how to eat right,<br> and you've never learned how to wash.<br> You're right. You're right. Thanks.<br> Talk to Melanie.<br> - Say hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Hello, how are you? I sent you a blouse.<br> EMMA: Say goodbye.<br> MELANIE: Bye.<br> Okay. Say good...<br> Say goodbye to your mother.<br> - What's her name?<br> - Janice. What did the doctor say?<br> I told you, Flap.<br> The scariest thing about it<br> is that he wants to do it so fast.<br> Janice. With her little folder<br> under her arm.<br> "I can't say anything until he does.<br> We've discussed it, Flap and I."<br> I mean, really, Flap!<br> "Validate my feelings". Your taste!<br> But that thing that the doctor said<br> about feeling good when it turns out...<br> No! No, no. Forget about it.<br> I'm not gonna make you feel better.<br> I'm too mad.<br> (SHOUTING)<br> Dinner!<br> - (SIGHS) Dear, you have a malignancy.<br> - Malignancy.<br> - Say it again?<br> - Malignancy.<br> Rosie.<br> Rosie, our girl is in trouble.<br> She had a cyst, a kind of a cyst,<br> and it turned out to be malignant.<br> And they're going to take her<br> to a hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska.<br> We'll release her in a few days.<br> We do more and more<br> on an outpatient basis.<br> We shouldn't need to take her back<br> here at all unless the illness escalates.<br> - But you're not telling me anything.<br> - What are you confused about?<br> How is she?<br> I always tell people to hope for the best<br> and prepare for the worst.<br> And they let you get away with that?<br> Look, you're wrong to take the attitude<br> that everything is so desperate<br> and serious now.<br> And it won't do your daughter<br> any good to get those signals, either.<br> What's wrong now?<br> I am so frustrated with that doctor.<br> But it all boils down to this.<br> You're getting out of here tomorrow,<br> and you don't have to stay here again.<br> Unless the illness spreads.<br> I really don't feel sick.<br> Emma. I want you to come to New York<br> for a visit. My treat.<br> Great. I mean, we'll have to see.<br> You guys have to see<br> these letters from the kids.<br> Look, Teddy says that he couldn't sleep<br> at all, but Melanie slept fine.<br> Tommy says that he really doesn't think<br> there's anything to be concerned about.<br> Hey, I mean it! You have some time<br> before you have to see the doctor again.<br> Come see New York for a few days.<br> I don't think it's a bad idea,<br> have a vacation by yourself.<br> Rosie and I are here with the kids.<br> - Take advantage of your freedom.<br> - I know you wanna go.<br> This isn't like when they take those kids<br> to Disneyland right before the end?<br> - Stop!<br> - Ow!<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - Patsy, I'm kidding!<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Do you feel funny<br> about leaving the kids?<br> I'm not leaving them.<br> I'm entrusting them to their father.<br> Oh, I thought as long as your mother<br> and Rosie are in town...<br> Not them. You.<br> - Emma. Emma, look! Look! Look!<br> - Are we there yet?<br> - Oh, God! I can't believe I'm here!<br> - Isn't it beautiful?<br> Hey, I want you to meet<br> some of my friends.<br> Not friends like you and I are friends.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Emma, this is Lizbeth.<br> - Hi, Elizabeth.<br> - Hi. It's Lizbeth.<br> Isn't that what I said?<br> No, you said "Elizabeth" with an "E".<br> It's Lizbeth.<br> - Two names? Liz Beth?<br> - No, no, one. Lizbeth.<br> - Lizbeth?<br> - Never mind.<br> - And this is Jane.<br> - Thank heavens!<br> - Here, that's Melanie.<br> - WOMAN 1: Oh, look at that!<br> Teddy's the younger one,<br> and Tommy's the older one.<br> (WOMEN CHATTERING)<br> LIZBETH: The little girl, she's incredible.<br> Yeah, don't think she doesn't know it.<br> Oh, Patsy's got a real thing going<br> with her. I mean, the boys, too.<br> WOMAN 2: Are you gonna wait till she's<br> in school before you go back to work?<br> Oh, I never really worked.<br> - Well, that's okay.<br> - Thanks.<br> (SIGHS)<br> Great.<br> WOMAN 1: When did she find out?<br> PATSY: About a month ago.<br> LIZBETH: There.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Nothing.<br> It was a great honour<br> meeting you, Emma.<br> - I hope you have a wonderful time here.<br> - Thank you.<br> I think those beautiful children are lucky<br> to have you for a mommy.<br> Y'all go ahead. Take the first cab.<br> We're not in a hurry.<br> - You sure?<br> - Yeah. That's fine.<br> See you.<br> - Bye bye, Patsy.<br> - Bye, darling.<br> - You told them, didn't you?<br> - You don't mind, do you?<br> Of course not.<br> Emma, come on. They're jerks.<br> They don't know anything.<br> Why do those women<br> have to act like that?<br> Emma, talk to me!<br> It's not you, Patsy. I don't care.<br> I don't mind them knowing.<br> In less than two hours, two of them<br> told me that they'd had abortions.<br> Three of them told me<br> they were divorced.<br> One hasn't talked to her mother<br> in four years.<br> And the one that has her little Natalie<br> in a boarding school<br> because she has to travel for her job?<br> I mean, hell, Patsy!<br> The one with the yeast disease<br> that thought she had vaginal herpes?<br> If that's fit conversation for lunch,<br> what's so god-awful terrible<br> about my little tumours?<br> Yeah, of course, but...<br> What do you want me to do?<br> I want you to tell them it ain't so tragic!<br> People do get better.<br> Tell them it's okay<br> to talk about the cancer!<br> Patsy tells us you have cancer.<br> (SPITS)<br> (LAUGHS)<br> We should really talk later.<br> I'm a nutritionist,<br> and my husband's with Ticketron.<br> (LAUGHS)<br> Thanks, Patsy.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Flap?<br> - Yes.<br> - Have you heard anything?<br> Uh, no. Emma hasn't called you either?<br> No. How are the children?<br> Oh, I wish I were so carefree.<br> Yes, well, they don't have anything<br> to feel ashamed about.<br> You know something, Aurora?<br> You always seem<br> to lose your manners around me.<br> Stop it, Flap. Let me know if you hear.<br> And if you talk to Emma, don't sound<br> as frightened as you do to me.<br> I don't sound frightened!<br> Daddy.<br> (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)<br> Hi, Mother. Look, they're having this<br> party for me, so I can't talk for very long.<br> But I think I'm coming home<br> a few days early.<br> Not really.<br> It's about time they gave us this room.<br> God, Mother, I can't believe you did this.<br> - It's great.<br> - Sure.<br> Careful there! These are worth more<br> than you'll ever make in your lifetime.<br> I grew up with her my whole life.<br> You can take it for a couple of minutes.<br> This is fine. Thank you so much.<br> Thank you.<br> Hmm.<br> - Oh, they're wonderful!<br> - They look good next to each other.<br> Help me with this, Melanie.<br> Gorgeous isn't everything.<br> This one. This one. Two more.<br> The response to the drugs we tried<br> isn't what we hoped.<br> But there are investigatory drugs<br> which we are willing to utilise.<br> However, if you become incapacitated,<br> or it becomes unreasonable for you<br> to handle your affairs for a block of time,<br> it might be wise<br> to make some decisions now.<br> - Any questions?<br> - (VOICE BREAKING) No.<br> I know what you're saying.<br> I have to figure out<br> what to do with my kids.<br> (SOBS)<br> (SOBBING)<br> Excuse me. It is after 10:00.<br> Give my daughter the pain shot, please.<br> Mrs Greenway, I was going to.<br> - Oh, good. Go ahead.<br> - Just a few minutes.<br> Well, please. It's after 10:00.<br> It's after 10:00.<br> I don't see why<br> she has to have this pain.<br> Ma'am, it's not my patient.<br> It's time for her shot!<br> You understand? Do something!<br> All she has to do is hold on until 10:00.<br> And it's past 10:00. She's in pain!<br> My daughter's in pain!<br> - Give her the shot! Do you understand?<br> - Are you going to behave?<br> Give my daughter the shot!<br> Thank you very much. Thank you.<br> Can I have 222, please?<br> Let's get her!<br> Pushing Grandma in<br> isn't a half bad idea.<br> Don't you dare! I mean it.<br> Come on.<br> - Say, "Hi, Granny."<br> - Hi, Granny.<br> MAN: Aurora?<br> (SOBS)<br> Well...<br> Who would have expected you<br> to be a nice guy?<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> - Who?<br> - It's good to see you.<br> (SOBBING)<br> Take care of yourself. I'll call you.<br> - I'm real glad I came.<br> - Your coming meant a lot to Emma.<br> It meant a lot to me, Garrett.<br> I'll be at the hospital all the time.<br> I'll call you.<br> No, if I do that,<br> and there's someone there,<br> I'll hear that funny sound in your voice.<br> I don't care. Who cares? I don't care.<br> I'm glad you came. I love you.<br> Garrett!<br> Come here.<br> I was curious.<br> Do you have any reaction at all<br> to my telling you I love you?<br> I was just inches from a clean getaway.<br> Well, you're stuck, so face it.<br> I don't know what else to say<br> except my stock answer.<br> - Which is?<br> - I love you too, kid.<br> AURORA: Goodbye.<br> I took him to the airport,<br> and we were standing there<br> in front of the door hugging,<br> and kissing and saying goodbye.<br> - And you know what?<br> - What?<br> I got up the nerve to tell him I loved him.<br> You know what<br> his reaction was, Emma?<br> I don't give a shit, Mom. I'm sick.<br> Not everything has something to do<br> with you. I've got a lot to figure out.<br> - I just don't wanna fight any more.<br> - What do you mean? When do we fight?<br> "When do we fight?" You amaze me.<br> I always think of us as fighting.<br> That's just from your end.<br> That's 'cause you're<br> never satisfied with me.<br> (FLAP SIGHS)<br> - Have you seen her yet today?<br> - Yes.<br> I've been with her most of<br> last night and today, as usual.<br> I haven't really talked to the kids yet.<br> I'm not sure how much they realise,<br> but they know<br> something bad is happening.<br> Flap.<br> Patsy wants to raise Melanie<br> and maybe the boys.<br> I think they should be with me,<br> don't you?<br> What can you be thinking about?<br> Raising three children,<br> working full time and chasing women<br> requires a lot more energy<br> than you have.<br> You know, one of the<br> nicest qualities about you<br> has always been that you recognised<br> your weaknesses.<br> Don't lose that quality now<br> when you need it the most.<br> You have no right nor any invitation<br> to discuss where<br> or how my children live.<br> From what the doctor says,<br> it's time that we have the talk now.<br> Do you know how much I hate<br> the idea of losing you?<br> Yes.<br> Well, nobody...<br> Nobody seems to know that except you.<br> - I... Well...<br> - What?<br> (CHUCKLES) I'm thinking<br> about my identity<br> and not having one any more. I mean...<br> Who am I, if I'm not the man<br> who's failing Emma?<br> - You didn't fail me, Flap.<br> - I don't wanna talk about this.<br> I feel like I'm sucking after forgiveness,<br> which I probably am.<br> You were no more terrible than I was.<br> No. Except for the cheating.<br> You're right. Let's not do this.<br> Look, we had problems.<br> It was never over<br> whether we loved each other.<br> Oh, God! That tie!<br> I can't believe you wore that!<br> God, the mess it must've been<br> for you to find it.<br> The house still isn't in one piece.<br> It was in the last box I looked in.<br> (LAUGHING) I'll bet.<br> God, you're easy to please.<br> I don't know why I couldn't do more of it.<br> I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.<br> It just means so much to me that<br> we can still feel like this, so much.<br> I swear...<br> Listen, I am getting tired.<br> Just tell me, hon,<br> you really want to raise 'em?<br> I never thought I was the sort of man<br> who'd give up his kids.<br> It's a lot of work.<br> As hard as you think it is,<br> you end up wishing it were that easy.<br> Where do you want them?<br> I don't want them to end up with Janice.<br> Well, she's not so bad.<br> I really don't think<br> they should be with you, honey.<br> Well, to tell you the honest truth,<br> I'd probably screw it up.<br> I'll really miss them.<br> Well, maybe we should let<br> Patsy take them.<br> Because it'd be very easy for me<br> to work research summers in New York.<br> No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.<br> Mother should have them.<br> You can see them any time you want.<br> Y'all will decide things<br> for them and everything.<br> - Emma, she can make that very difficult.<br> - She won't.<br> (SIGHS)<br> Well, (CLEARS THROAT) I guess<br> they should be with your mother.<br> I probably have that coming.<br> (LAUGHING)<br> EMMA: Oh!<br> Flap, will you bring<br> the boys by tomorrow?<br> I've got that one waiting for me.<br> I gotta do it.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Thanks.<br> EMMA: Come on, Pats. I gotta get ready.<br> Patsy. Make-up!<br> (BOTH CHUCKLE)<br> Is it terrible for me to say that<br> I can't stand seeing your mother<br> get her hands on that little girl?<br> I'd just love to raise that little girl.<br> Look, I'd let you,<br> but Teddy couldn't spare her.<br> (SOBS)<br> I can't stall any more, all right?<br> You go out there and send the boys in.<br> - Well, do I get to say something ever?<br> - No.<br> (BOTH LAUGH)<br> We don't have to do that, right?<br> Come here.<br> You'll be fine. You will.<br> (VOICE BREAKING)<br> It's just this.<br> (SOBS)<br> You're my touchstone, Emma.<br> The boys.<br> (BED WHIRRING)<br> Hi. Come on.<br> I love you. I miss you.<br> God, I want you to come home.<br> Close the door.<br> Guys, you both look so gigantic to me.<br> - I guess I look pretty bad to you.<br> - Not so bad.<br> You both have beautiful eyes,<br> and your hair's too long.<br> I don't care how long it gets in the back,<br> but keep your bangs cut, okay?<br> - It's too long.<br> - That's a matter of opinion.<br> Just keep it short, all right?<br> Are you getting well?<br> Mmm-mmm.<br> Look up.<br> I'm sorry about this, but I can't help it.<br> And I can't talk to you for too long,<br> or I'll get real upset.<br> I want you to make a lot of friends.<br> And I want you to be real nice<br> to the girls,<br> 'cause they're going to be<br> real important to you, I swear.<br> We're not afraid of girls.<br> What makes you think that?<br> - Well, you may be later on.<br> - I doubt it.<br> - Why don't you shut up? Shut up!<br> - You shut up.<br> Teddy, give me a kiss. Come on.<br> Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.<br> And stop trying to pretend<br> like you hate me. I mean, it's silly.<br> I like you.<br> Okay, then will you<br> listen especially close?<br> What?<br> - You'll listen real hard?<br> - I said, "What?"<br> I know you like me. I know it.<br> For the last year or two, you've been<br> pretending like you hate me.<br> I love you very much.<br> I love you as much as I love anybody,<br> as much as I love myself.<br> And in a few years,<br> when I haven't been around<br> to be on your tail about something<br> or irritating you,<br> you're gonna remember.<br> You're gonna remember that time<br> I bought you the baseball glove<br> when you thought we were too broke,<br> or when I read you those stories,<br> or when I let you goof off instead of<br> mowing the lawn, lots of things like that.<br> And you're gonna realise<br> that you love me,<br> and maybe you're gonna feel badly<br> because you never told me, but don't.<br> I know that you love me.<br> So don't ever do that<br> to yourself, all right?<br> Okay.<br> - Okay?<br> - I said, "Okay."<br> Okay, you two should run along.<br> Take care.<br> Give me a kiss.<br> I was so scared,<br> but I think it went really well, don't you?<br> Yeah?<br> Tommy, if you need to talk,<br> your dad will listen.<br> He's a very smart man, you know.<br> All you have to do is<br> go up to him and say,<br> "Dad, I'm confused.<br> I need to have a talk."<br> You know, I met this boy<br> back in River Oaks where I live.<br> He was telling me that the Cub Scouts<br> in Houston are the best ever.<br> We were never Scouts. Our mother<br> was too lazy to check it out.<br> No! Stop!<br> Come on! Stop it!<br> No!<br> Listen to me! Listen. It's okay, Tom.<br> It's okay. Now... Hey! Stop it!<br> I'm sorry, but I just can't have you<br> criticising your mother around me.<br> (TOMMY SOBBING)<br> Mr Horton. Mr Horton? She's gone.<br> (STIFLED SOBBING)<br> Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid.<br> Somehow I thought...<br> Somehow I thought<br> when she finally went,<br> (SOBBING)<br> That it would be a relief.<br> Oh, my sweet, little darling!<br> Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.<br> There's nothing...<br> Do you want some cake?<br> - Why are you standing over here?<br> - I don't know.<br> Come on. You wanna come over<br> and sit with me?<br> Everything's gonna be all right, Tommy.<br> There's fantastic dance schools<br> in Houston.<br> - Tap?<br> - Tap, ballet, aerobics.<br> Anything you want.<br> Come over here and see your dad.<br> He really knows a pretty girl,<br> doesn't he?<br> She's too old for him.<br> Are you eating away at bunny? Here.<br> Better go on over to Dad and eat it.<br> Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?<br> I understand you're a swimmer.<br> - Me, too.<br> - But you're an astronaut, right?<br> I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.<br> Pretty good-looking suit, there.<br> A little closer. A little closer.<br> A little closer.<br> Do you want to see my pool?<br> Well, I don't know if the time is right.<br> You know, funeral and everything.<br> I think it is. Come on.<br> I'll show you the internationally<br> infamous Breedlove crawl.<br> Just a little stroke<br> I picked up out in space.<br>
