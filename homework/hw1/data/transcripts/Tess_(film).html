                        - Good night.<br> - Good night, Sir John.<br> Begging your pardon, sir.<br> We met on this selfsame road<br> the other day...<br> ...and I said, "Good night," and<br> you replied, "Good night, Sir John."<br> I may have.<br> - Did so again today.<br> - So I did.<br> Why call me "Sir John" when I be<br> plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?<br> Just a whim of mine.<br> I'm Parson Tringham by the way.<br> I made a discovery about you<br> while tracing some family trees...<br> ...for our new county history.<br> I'm an antiquarian, you know.<br> You, Durbeyfield,<br> are directly descended...<br> ...from the knightly house<br> of the d'Urbervilles.<br> - Did you really not know that?<br> - Never heard it before, sir.<br> Raise your head a little so that I can<br> see your face from the side.<br> Yes, that's the d'Urberville<br> nose and chin.<br> - A trifle coarser than of old, but still.<br> - Daze my eyes.<br> According to the records, your line<br> goes back to Sir Pagan d'Urberville...<br> ...who came from Normandy<br> with William the Conqueror.<br> I've been slaving away<br> and living rough all these years?<br> Well, I thought you might already<br> know something about it.<br> It is true, I got an old silver spoon<br> at home and a graven seal...<br> ...but I never paid them much heed.<br> Where do we d'Urbervilles live today?<br> You don't live anywhere.<br> You lie buried in your family vault<br> at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill...<br> ...laid out in lead coffins with your<br> effigies under marble canopies.<br> - And where be our family mansions?<br> - You haven't any.<br> No land neither?<br> None at all?<br> You had an abundance of land<br> in the old days.<br> What can I do about it, sir?<br> Well, as to that...<br> - Can I do nothing?<br> - Nothing whatever...<br> ...save possibly chasten yourself<br> by thinking:<br> "How are the mighty fallen."<br> Good night...<br> ...Sir John.<br> Won't you take a quart of beer<br> with me, sir?<br> There's a grand brew to be had<br> at The Pure Drop.<br> Though not so good as at Rolliver's.<br> Sir John d'Urberville.<br> That's who I am.<br> What is this?<br> - It is our club dance, sir.<br> - Club dance?<br> - But where are your partners?<br> - They've not finished work yet.<br> They'll be here by and by.<br> - Will you join us till then, sir?<br> - With pleasure...<br> ...but one partner won't go far<br> among so many.<br> One's better than none.<br> It is sad work a-footing it<br> with no one to give you a squeeze.<br> Don't be so forward.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I've a mind to enjoy myself. Come on.<br> You're full of nonsense.<br> Suppose someone sees us.<br> All right, go on. Don't wait for me.<br> I'll catch you up in five minutes.<br> Sir? Hey, hey, hey, sir?<br> Hey, sir?<br> Life has found me<br> a great gentleman.<br> - Noblest in the county!<br> - Lord, oh, Lord.<br> If it isn't your father<br> riding home in his cart.<br> There bain't be a man in the whole<br> of Wessex with finer skeletons than I!<br> Father's tired, that's all.<br> He sent for the cart<br> because our own horse died.<br> You know that very well.<br> Rows and rows<br> of knightly ancestors, I got.<br> Bain't be a man in the whole<br> of Wessex with finer skeletons than I.<br> I'm glad you've come.<br> Where are you off to?<br> I thought I'd change and help you.<br> You bide here. I want to tell you<br> what's happened.<br> We've been found to be the greatest<br> gentlefolk in the county...<br> ...reaching back long before<br> Oliver Crumble's time...<br> ...back to the days<br> of the pagan Turks.<br> With monuments and vaults...<br> ...and crests and coats of arms,<br> and the Lord knows what all!<br> Is that why Father made such<br> a mommet of himself in that cart?<br> Our true name is d'Urberville.<br> That's why he came home in style,<br> not because he'd been drinking.<br> Where is he now?<br> It was a parson told him<br> the pedigree of the matter.<br> - But where is he now?<br> - Well, to tell you the truth...<br> ...he was that upset, he's gone off<br> to Rolliver's to get up his strength.<br> Much strength he'll find<br> at the bottom of a pint pot.<br> Very well, I'll go and get him.<br> We'll be back afore you know it.<br> Now, look, be a good girl<br> and put the little ones to bed for me.<br> There it is.<br> That?<br> That spoon may be small,<br> but my family was great.<br> - Jack, I've got a project.<br> - We owned carriages, estates...<br> ...and mansions without number.<br> - Listen to me.<br> Is there any money in it?<br> It is well to be kin to a coach,<br> even if you don't ride in one.<br> I've been thinking since<br> you brought me the news.<br> - I've got a project.<br> - Which reminds me, woman.<br> You better find that dang seal<br> of ours, or I'll do you a mischief.<br> Listen. There's a great lady<br> by the name of d'Urberville...<br> ...living out by Trantridge.<br> Well, she's nothing compared<br> with us.<br> Younger branch of the family,<br> no doubt.<br> I'll wager they don't go back<br> to King Norman's day.<br> That's as may be, but she's rich.<br> Lot of good her money will do us.<br> It could do. We must send<br> our Tess to claim kin.<br> - Claim kin?<br> - Why shouldn't two branches...<br> ...of the same family<br> be on visiting terms?<br> It would certainly put her<br> in the way of a grand marriage.<br> Then she ought to go there tomorrow.<br> Let's drink to that. Mrs. Rolliver!<br> There you are, my poppet.<br> We was just on our way.<br> But you're asking me to go begging.<br> Begging. What are you saying?<br> It is all in the family.<br> If they was in need, I should<br> take them in without a word.<br> We all have to take the ups<br> with the downs, Tess.<br> Now, you must go and see her...<br> ...and ask her for some help<br> in our trouble.<br> If the lady received me at all, it<br> would be enough if she were friendly.<br> You must not expect her to help us.<br> Come, come, my dear.<br> With your pretty face,<br> you could coax her into anything.<br> I'd rather try to get work.<br> Durbeyfield, you decide.<br> If you say she must go, she'll go.<br> Well, girl, do you want to go visiting<br> this grand kinswoman of ours?<br> - I'd much sooner not, Father.<br> - There, she doesn't want to!<br> I don't like my children making<br> themselves beholden with strange kin.<br> I'm the head of the noblest branch<br> of the family...<br> ...and I got my pride to think of.<br> All this bragging about your ancestors.<br> It isn't them as will buy us<br> a new horse.<br> It's all new.<br> Well, my beauty...<br> ...what can I do for you?<br> - I came to see Mrs. D'Urberville.<br> - I'm afraid that's impossible.<br> She's an invalid.<br> What was your business with her?<br> I'm her son.<br> It wasn't business, it was...<br> I can hardly say what.<br> - Not business, sir, no.<br> - Pleasure, then?<br> No, sir.<br> It is so very foolish, I...<br> - I fear I can't tell you.<br> - Never mind.<br> I like foolish things.<br> Try again, dear.<br> I came, sir, to tell you that...<br> ...we are of the same family as you.<br> Poor relations?<br> - Yes.<br> - Stokes?<br> No, d'Urbervilles.<br> Yes, yes, I meant d'Urbervilles.<br> Tell me...<br> ...do you like strawberries?<br> - Yes, when they're in season.<br> - Here, they already are.<br> Our name has become Durbeyfield...<br> ...but we have several proofs<br> that we're d'Urbervilles.<br> That's who the antiquarians<br> hold we are, so Mother said...<br> ...we should make ourselves<br> beknown to you...<br> ...as we've lost our horse...<br> ...and we are the oldest branch<br> of the family.<br> I see.<br> So you've come to pay me<br> a courtesy call, really...<br> ...as one relation to another.<br> - I suppose I have.<br> - Yes. Well, there's no harm in that.<br> I would rather take it<br> from my own hand.<br> Don't be so coy, my pretty cousin.<br> There.<br> Come, this one too.<br> It's the perfect place.<br> Believe me.<br> You'll look a regular posy!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - A thorn.<br> Cousin, beauty has its price.<br> I'm not very hungry. Truly, I'm not.<br> Nonsense.<br> You must eat something<br> before you go.<br> It's no mean ride<br> from here to your village.<br> I shall see what I can do for you.<br> But listen, Tess, no more<br> of this d'Urberville nonsense.<br> Plain Durbeyfield, understand?<br> It's quite a different name.<br> I wish for no better, sir.<br> "In reference to your daughter<br> and further to her visit...<br> ...we write to inform you<br> of our willingness...<br> ...to consider engaging her services...<br> ...in the managing of a poultry farm<br> of modern character.<br> Lf, after a suitable period,<br> your daughter...<br> ...proves satisfactory,<br> we should guarantee her...<br> ...comfortable accommodation<br> and a good wage.<br> Your earliest reply would be<br> greatly appreciated."<br> So you charmed them after all,<br> did you?<br> Let me see that letter.<br> - Who wrote it?<br> - Who?<br> Mrs. D'Urberville, of course.<br> Look at the signature.<br> Me? Manage a poultry farm?<br> - I truly don't think I should go.<br> - Poultry.<br> It is just her way of getting you there<br> without raising your hopes too much.<br> She's going to own you as kin.<br> Hey! The seal!<br> This is it!<br> It's the same as ours.<br> Look at it, lad.<br> A ramping, great, big lion<br> with a castle on top.<br> There's no denying it, girl.<br> Mrs. D'Urberville recognized<br> her own flesh and blood.<br> But she never even saw me.<br> Well, you couldn't expect her to throw<br> her arms round your neck...<br> ...her being an invalid.<br> But her son made you welcome.<br> He called you "cousin," didn't he?<br> I'd rather bide here with you.<br> Goodbye, Father.<br> - You're off, then?<br> - Yes. Goodbye, Father.<br> Goodbye, girl.<br> You're a comely sight.<br> This young cousin of yours...<br> ...tell him that, being so come down<br> in the world...<br> ...l'll sell him the title.<br> Yes, I'll sell it, but a fair price.<br> Not less than<br> a thousand pounds, mind.<br> That's right, tell him<br> I'll take a thousand pounds.<br> Well, now I come to think on it...<br> ...he can have it for a hundred.<br> I won't stand on trifles.<br> Fifty.<br> Twenty pounds, tell him,<br> and not a penny less.<br> - Family honor is family honor.<br> - Come, it's time to go.<br> I want to walk a little ways<br> with Tess.<br> So do I, now she's leaving<br> to marry our gentleman cousin.<br> I'll hear no more of that.<br> Mother, how could you have put<br> such nonsense into their heads?<br> She's going to work for a rich relation,<br> my dears...<br> ...and help us earn enough money<br> to get a new horse.<br> Oh, Mother, I wish our Tess<br> hadn't gone to be a lady.<br> Don't hold my arm!<br> Grab me round the waist!<br> Ungrateful little minx. Why abandon<br> me as soon as you feel safe?<br> The danger came of your foolishness.<br> I say, what a temper.<br> When people are on top of a hill,<br> they have to get down somehow.<br> But not at a gallop, surely.<br> Fancy being asked that<br> by a brave little beauty like you.<br> I always go downhill at a gallop.<br> You can't beat it<br> for stirring the blood.<br> But perhaps you needn't<br> do so again.<br> Perhaps not.<br> It all depends.<br> One little kiss on those ruby lips<br> or even on that satin cheek...<br> ...and I drive at a snail's pace,<br> word of honor.<br> But I don't want to be kissed, sir.<br> Stop, stop, I beg you!<br> Very well, do as you wish.<br> I don't mind.<br> But I thought you'd protect me,<br> being a kinsman.<br> Kinsman be hanged.<br> You're mighty sensitive<br> for a village lass.<br> - Oh, my hat!<br> - Whoa, boy.<br> You look even prettier without it!<br> - Come along, now. Up you get.<br> - No, sir.<br> - You won't ride with me?<br> - No, I shall walk.<br> It's four miles to Trantridge, at least.<br> I wouldn't care if it were 20.<br> You watch out for Dollop, the bailiff.<br> He's a devil.<br> Not Mr. Alec. Spends half<br> his time on horseback...<br> ...and the rest of it chasing<br> the likes of us.<br> His mother's a queer old soul,<br> but no real trouble.<br> It is a mercy for us she's blind.<br> - Mrs. D'Urberville's blind?<br> - Stone-blind.<br> Their real name is Stoke.<br> How's that?<br> It were Mr. Alec's father<br> had the notion.<br> He bought the name<br> of an old extinguished family...<br> ...to make himself important.<br> Whatever are you doing?<br> Missus is waiting for her birds.<br> Quick, it slipped my mind entirely.<br> Now, you catch hold<br> of Phena there...<br> ...and that one.<br> That one there and the white one.<br> So you are the new young woman.<br> Well, how are my birds?<br> This is Strut.<br> He doesn't seem so lively today,<br> does he?<br> He's alarmed at being handled<br> by a stranger, I suppose.<br> And Phena?<br> Yes, yes.<br> They are a little frightened.<br> Aren't you, my poor dears?<br> Never mind.<br> They'll soon get used to you.<br> Can you whistle?<br> Whistle, ma'am?<br> Yes, whistle tunes.<br> A little.<br> Then you will have to practice<br> every day.<br> I think a lot of my fowls, but there are<br> also my bullfinches to consider.<br> I had a young lad who whistled<br> to them very well, but he left.<br> They've been neglected for days.<br> Master Alec whistled to them<br> this morning, ma'am.<br> Him.<br> Nor art nor nature ever created<br> a lovelier thing than you, Cousin Tess.<br> To see that pretty mouth<br> pouting and puffing away...<br> ...without producing a single note.<br> - It is all a part of my work, sir.<br> - Never mind. I'll teach you.<br> I won't lay a finger on you.<br> See? I'll stay exactly where I am.<br> Now you watch me.<br> Don't screw up your lips too tight.<br> Do it like this.<br> Blow gently.<br> Gently.<br> Try.<br> No, no. Try again.<br> Again.<br> There. You'll manage splendidly<br> now I've started you off.<br> Tell me, Tess, don't you find<br> my mother a little odd?<br> I hardly know her, sir.<br> Well, I'm not in her good books<br> at the moment.<br> But you should find favor<br> if you treat her livestock well.<br> If you meet with any difficulties...<br> ...don't go to Dollop...<br> ...come to me.<br> What? Don't you fancy<br> a dance, then?<br> I'm mortal tired.<br> - When are you all going home?<br> - Soon enough, soon enough.<br> Well, my beauty.<br> What are you doing here<br> this time of night?<br> I'm waiting for the others, sir...<br> ...not being acquainted<br> with the road home.<br> I only have a saddle horse.<br> Come to the inn with me.<br> I'll hire a trap for us both.<br> No, no. Thank you,<br> but I promised to wait for them.<br> Very well. Silly girl.<br> Please yourself.<br> What's that creeping<br> down your back?<br> Well, I declare!<br> It is treacle!<br> - You dare laugh at me, you hussy.<br> - I can't help it.<br> No more than the others.<br> You think you're the queen<br> of Trantridge...<br> ...just because you're first favorite<br> with him.<br> She never said anything.<br> Leave her.<br> I'll show you. I'm worth two of your<br> sort for all your airs and graces.<br> If I'd known what sort you were...<br> ...l'd never have lowered myself<br> by accepting your company.<br> - I'll show you.<br> - Hey there, workfolk.<br> What's all the row about?<br> Quickly, jump up beside me.<br> Out of the frying pan, into the fire.<br> - Where are we?<br> - Passing through The Chase.<br> The Chase?<br> It is out of our way, surely.<br> This forest is one of the oldest<br> and loveliest in England, Tess.<br> Don't you think it deserves<br> to be seen...<br> ...on a glorious God-given<br> night like this?<br> Yes, but...<br> No buts. There's a good girl.<br> I'll be honest with you.<br> I'm happy.<br> I'm trying to prolong the moment.<br> You were shivering a while back.<br> Now I can feel your warmth<br> against me.<br> - Are you still cold?<br> - No, not now.<br> I'll let my animal<br> walk a little further.<br> He'll make better progress<br> once he's rested.<br> Tell me...<br> ...what news of your parents' horse?<br> - They have no horse.<br> They have since Monday last.<br> - Did you...?<br> - Forgive me for mentioning it.<br> I thought they would have<br> written to you.<br> - I don't know what to say.<br> - It's nothing.<br> I knew how important it was<br> for your father to have a new horse.<br> Really.<br> It's you he should thank.<br> I'm grateful to you.<br> Truly I am.<br> But I almost wish<br> you hadn't done this.<br> Yes, I almost do.<br> - Is that a reproach?<br> - Oh, no.<br> It is very kind of you, I'm sure.<br> I've been in torment<br> ever since you came to us.<br> - Then I'll leave tomorrow, sir.<br> - That's absurd.<br> I don't want you to leave.<br> That's the last thing I want.<br> Is there no hope for me?<br> None at all?<br> Tess.<br> I'm dying for you.<br> Can't you see?<br> Forgive me.<br> Oh, please forgive me.<br> - Are you hurt?<br> - No, it's nothing. Nothing.<br> You're bleeding.<br> Oh, my God.<br> How ever could I have<br> done such a thing?<br> It's me.<br> Don't be so foolish.<br> Open the door.<br> You'll force me<br> to make a noise, Tess.<br> My mother has sharp ears.<br> She'll hear.<br> Enough of this nonsense, darling.<br> Open up.<br> Why sneak away...<br> ...like a thief?<br> And at this hour in the morning?<br> Nobody would've prevented<br> you leaving.<br> At least let me drive you home.<br> Unless you'd care to come back.<br> I shan't come back.<br> - What are you crying for?<br> - I was only thinking...<br> ...I was born over there.<br> Well, we all have<br> to be born somewhere.<br> L... I wish I'd never been born.<br> - There or anywhere else.<br> - You're absurdly melancholy, Tess.<br> You can hold your own for beauty<br> against any woman.<br> Queen or commoner.<br> I tell you that as a practical man<br> who wishes you well.<br> If you're wise, you'll let the world<br> get a clearer sight of that beauty...<br> ...before it fades.<br> Why not make the most of life?<br> We didn't fare so badly<br> together, did we?<br> - I was blinded for a while, that's all.<br> - That's what all women say.<br> How dare you talk like that?<br> Has it never struck you what all<br> women say, some women may feel?<br> - All right. I was wrong, I admit it.<br> - Please, please stop.<br> I should like to get down here.<br> I'm a bad lot, I suppose.<br> A damn bad lot.<br> I was born bad,<br> and I warrant I'll die bad.<br> Listen, Tess...<br> ...if circumstances should arise,<br> do you understand?<br> If you're ever in the least trouble,<br> the least difficulty...<br> ...just send me one line, and you shall<br> have whatever you need by return.<br> You really won't come back?<br> Goodbye, my four months' cousin.<br> Goodbye.<br> Tess?<br> It is no use her pretending<br> she hates it...<br> ...and wishes it in the churchyard<br> and herself beside it.<br> She loves that child of hers.<br> Poor little mite.<br> It don't look long for this world.<br> Good evening, Durbeyfield.<br> - What's your business?<br> - My business?<br> The child. I must baptize it before<br> the Lord gathers it to his bosom.<br> What child are you speaking of?<br> All my children are baptized.<br> You ought to know.<br> Durbeyfield, don't play games<br> with the Almighty.<br> I don't play, sir, I work!<br> I work! Like a beast of the field.<br> You can tell the Almighty that<br> from me.<br> - My baby's dying.<br> - You ought to have been more careful.<br> Like it or not, Jack,<br> that child was born.<br> It is here, under your own roof.<br> - Not true.<br> - Father, come to your senses.<br> For pity's sake, let the vicar in!<br> He shan't set foot inside this house.<br> Not over my dead body!<br> There's enough disgrace<br> on my name as it is.<br> O merciful God, take pity.<br> Take pity on him.<br> Send down your anger on me.<br> But have mercy on my child.<br> My child.<br> I should like to ask you<br> something, sir.<br> Well, speak, girl. I'm listening.<br> Each of us shares<br> in your sad affliction, my child.<br> We're all members<br> of the suffering body of Christ.<br> My son was baptized.<br> Baptized? By whom?<br> By me, last night.<br> What procedure did you follow?<br> I woke my little brothers<br> and sisters...<br> ...and made them<br> kneel down to pray.<br> 'Liza-Lu held the prayer book open.<br> I lit a candle.<br> And then?<br> Then I held my child like this<br> over the basin.<br> Yes.<br> I poured some water on his forehead,<br> and I said:<br> "I baptize thee...<br> ...in the name of the Father,<br> Son and Holy Ghost."<br> - Did you make the sign of the cross?<br> - Yes, I did that too.<br> Will it be just the same<br> as if you'd baptized him?<br> In the sight of God, I mean.<br> Yes, my dear girl.<br> It will be the same.<br> Then you'll give him<br> a Christian burial?<br> That's another matter.<br> Another matter? Why?<br> Well, that would concern<br> the village as a whole.<br> Not just the two of us,<br> you understand.<br> Won't you do it, sir?<br> Just this once?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I beg you, please.<br> I told you.<br> It's out of the question.<br> Then I don't like you.<br> I shall never come<br> to your church again.<br> Never.<br> Never!<br> - Hey, Mr. Crick.<br> - Eh?<br> What, here already?<br> We didn't expect you afore tomorrow.<br> It is quite a step from here<br> to Weatherbury.<br> - Marlott, sir. I come from Marlott.<br> - Yes, Marlott.<br> Well, that's even further.<br> Quite sure you can stand it here?<br> It is comfortable enough<br> for rough folk...<br> ...but we don't live<br> in a cowcumber frame.<br> I'm accustomed to that.<br> I used to know your part<br> of the county when I were a lad.<br> Good. Right you are.<br> Well, you'll want a rest<br> and a morsel of food.<br> I'd rather begin now,<br> to get my hand in.<br> Oh, come on.<br> You must be famished.<br> No, thank you.<br> A little milk will suffice.<br> Well, if you can swallow that,<br> so be it.<br> It is what I hain't touched for years.<br> It lies in my innards like lead.<br> To my thinking, the beasts<br> aren't giving all they should.<br> That's because there's<br> a new hand come amongst us.<br> I've known it happen afore.<br> They do say that the milk goes up<br> into their horns at such times.<br> Anyone would think we were<br> back in the Middle Ages.<br> I don't appear to be making<br> much progress.<br> Take it gentle, sir. Take it gentle.<br> Whoa, now.<br> - It is skill that does it, not strength.<br> - So my aching fingers tell me.<br> Mrs. Crick's too proud to come<br> milking with us, and that's a fact.<br> Still, there's little enough<br> to wherrit about.<br> And we do eat like gamecocks.<br> No, you'll like it here.<br> Mr. Crick, he's a very kindly man.<br> Just fancy. He has his own<br> family pew in church.<br> Dairyman Dick all the week<br> On Sundays, Mr. Richard Crick<br> Who's that playing?<br> Mr. Clare.<br> Mr. Clare.<br> Him that's learning to milk.<br> Angel Clare, he's called.<br> Angel.<br> It is no common name.<br> He never says much to us,<br> more's the pity.<br> Why?<br> Does he scorn common folk?<br> Quite the opposite.<br> He often makes mock of old families.<br> It is quite simple.<br> He's a parson's son<br> with a mind to be a farmer.<br> He's already tried his hand<br> at sheep farming.<br> Now he's learning dairy work<br> with Mr. Crick.<br> But what does he hold against<br> old families?<br> He says they're...<br> ...worm-eaten.<br> That be your soul trying to escape.<br> It is bread, that's all.<br> No, it is when you sneeze,<br> you're like to blow your soul away.<br> As I see it, no soul can leave<br> its mortal shell afore a body dies.<br> What if a man falls down<br> in a faint, Master Crick?<br> Well, that's a different matter.<br> The spirit bides there inside you,<br> but you cannot feel it.<br> But we can sometimes make<br> our souls leave our bodies.<br> How's that, then, maidy?<br> Only have to lie<br> on the grass at night...<br> ...and look straight up<br> at some bright star.<br> And stare at it with all your might.<br> And by and by, you'll feel<br> you're falling into the sky...<br> ...miles and miles from your body...<br> ...which you'll don't seem<br> to need at all.<br> Tess!<br> Why run away like that?<br> - Are you afraid?<br> - No, sir. Not of outdoor things. No.<br> - But you have your indoor fears, eh?<br> - Heavens, yes.<br> Of what?<br> I couldn't rightly say.<br> Of the milk turning sour?<br> No.<br> Fear of life, in general?<br> Yes, sir.<br> So have I. Very often.<br> Life's a puzzle. Don't you think?<br> Perhaps...<br> ...now you put it that way.<br> It is no use. It won't take.<br> If this continues, I shall have<br> to call on Conjurer Trendle.<br> I don't say I believe in him, mind.<br> But if nothing else works,<br> I shall have to try it, shan't I?<br> Somebody here's in love, I'll be bound.<br> That can cause it, so I've heard.<br> Conjurer Fall,<br> to the side of Casterbridge.<br> He had the knack of it<br> when I was a lad.<br> It is a pity. He must be feeding<br> the worms by now.<br> My grandpa used to go to Conjurer<br> Mynterne out at Owlscombe.<br> But there's no folk<br> like him these days.<br> Somebody's in love, I tell you.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - The blasted butter won't come.<br> - Why is that?<br> - To my mind...<br> How warm it is today.<br> I think I'd be better out-of-doors.<br> They do say it happens<br> when people are in love.<br> I remember as a girl...<br> Don't push.<br> He looks so sad.<br> Whatever can he be thinking of?<br> Well, not of us.<br> You can rely on that.<br> You're a fine one to talk, lzz.<br> - I saw you.<br> - What did you see?<br> It was the other day.<br> I saw you kissing his shadow.<br> Here he comes again.<br> Dear eyes...<br> Dear face...<br> Dear Mr. Clare.<br> It is terrible to think he'll never wed<br> any one of us.<br> More likely, he'll ask us to milk<br> his cows for so much a year.<br> What are we going to do?<br> We shall have to take<br> the stone-bridge road.<br> We'll be late.<br> - Doesn't he go to church?<br> - No, never.<br> I wish he would.<br> You look like cats afraid of water.<br> Only on account<br> of our Sunday best, sir.<br> Very well. I'll carry you<br> just as you are.<br> No, no, I'm far too heavy.<br> Nonsense. I could carry<br> all four of you at once.<br> Hold on to me. That's it.<br> I should put my arms around<br> his neck and look into his eyes.<br> There's nothing in that.<br> There's a time for everything<br> under heaven.<br> A time to kiss and a time to cuddle.<br> Shame on you, lzz.<br> That's scripture.<br> I always heed the prettiest<br> verses in church.<br> If you helped me, perhaps I could<br> climb along the bank.<br> Tess.<br> I've gone to three-quarters of this<br> trouble for your sake alone.<br> She's angry. She doesn't understand.<br> She'll kick over the bucket.<br> Forgive me, my darling Tess.<br> I don't know what came over me.<br> There's only one excuse for it.<br> I love you.<br> Yes, I love you.<br> Angel?<br> Angel.<br> Hello, Mercy. Forgive me.<br> I didn't see you.<br> Forgive me.<br> Welcome home.<br> - How are you?<br> - Very well.<br> God be praised. You look radiant<br> with health, I see.<br> The open air, probably.<br> Have you come to spend<br> the holidays with your brothers?<br> Are they here? I had no idea.<br> No, I'm only paying my parents a brief<br> visit to settle some urgent business.<br> Then I won't detain you.<br> I have my Bible class<br> to take, in any case.<br> Au revoir, Angel.<br> - Angel!<br> - Angel! My boy.<br> I apologize, Father. I had no time<br> to warn you of my arrival.<br> Perhaps you've forgotten how<br> to write. With a pen, remember?<br> I brought you farmhouse delicacies.<br> Black puddings<br> and a bottle of mead.<br> Black puddings?<br> It's true your mother and I<br> have regretted...<br> ...hearing so little of your news.<br> You must bear with him, Father.<br> Spending all his time<br> with sheep and cattle...<br> ...takes one closer to nature<br> but further from Oxford.<br> I would remind you, Felix...<br> ...that a university education<br> means nothing...<br> ...unless it redounds<br> to the glory of God.<br> It can also redound<br> to the glory of man.<br> Only in the second place.<br> How far are you<br> in your apprenticeship?<br> It's drawing to a close.<br> What counts is spiritual cleanliness.<br> Isn't that so, Father?<br> The two go together, my boy.<br> Father tells us you intend<br> setting up on your own.<br> Yes.<br> - In what part of the world?<br> - I don't know yet.<br> The colonies perhaps.<br> Heaven preserve us.<br> It would suit the type of<br> farming I have in mind.<br> - What colony?<br> - The choice is wide.<br> Or I may settle in a foreign country.<br> Some places offer land to immigrants<br> on very favorable terms.<br> Brazil, for example.<br> Wonders will never cease.<br> Nothing's settled yet.<br> I came here to discuss it.<br> That among other things.<br> Shall we take a drop of good<br> Mrs. Crick's delicious mead?<br> Oh forgive me . I forgot.<br> Strong drink is the root of all evil.<br> Take us into your confidence.<br> Is it something serious?<br> Not serious, but something<br> important. The truth is<br> son't you think it's time<br> i considered marrying?<br> Yes indeed my boy, yes indeed.<br> Your mother and I have sometimes<br> debated the same question.<br> Really?<br> And what sort of wife would you favour<br> for a budding farmer like myself?<br> Truly christian, god-fearing woman.<br> One who will be of help and<br> a comfort to you in all things.<br> The rest matters little.<br> You musn't hesitate, dear son.<br> Why hesitate?<br> To marry your heart's desire.<br> Mercy Chant.<br> She may be fond of over-<br> decorating the church and<br> flipparies and flowers,<br> scraps of lacys and so forth but<br> It's merely a girl's fancies. It will pass.<br> Mercy's a pure and virtuous girl.<br> Oh yes I know she's pure and virtuous.<br> But honesty compels me to<br> inform you that I have other plans.<br> Other plans?<br> Very much sir.<br> Mercy Chant appeals more<br> to you than she does to me.<br> I'm not disputing her merits<br> I'm only speaking of my own inclinations.<br> My dearest boy.<br> Angel.Please remember that<br> you are addressing your parents.<br> I'm aware of that.<br> I already know the woman I intend to marry.<br> Her name is Teresa Durbeyfield.<br> Father, Mother. I respect you both.<br> I also respect Mercy Chant.<br> And have no doubt<br> she'll find worthier husband with or<br> without your help. As for me,<br> my mind is made up.<br> Oh it's you...<br> Tess, I want to ask you this now.<br> Will you be my wife?<br> I love you with all my heart and soul.<br> I can not be your wife.<br> Don't you love me?<br> Oh yes yes...<br> I'd rather belong to you<br> than anyone in the world.<br> Forgive me. I can't marry you.<br> It was the good lord who put<br> this nice young person's in your way.<br> You must believe that.<br> But with respects to your question,<br> I tell you quite private but<br> very strong. On no accounts,<br> say a word about your bygone trouble.<br> Never a word, my girl. Least of all to him.<br> Tess. Why does the idea of<br> becoming my wife displease you?<br> I never said that. It would please me so much.<br> It's simply that I can not.<br> Why? Is there someone else?<br> Don't i deserve to know the truth?<br> Well?<br> Not now<br> When then?<br> Later.<br> But why?<br> I'll tell you when we get home.<br> You'll stop loving<br> me when you know.<br> Let me wait till then.<br> Londoners will drink it at<br> their breakfast tomorrow, won't they?<br> Yes but watered down,<br> in case it goes to their heads.<br> Strangers that we have never seen.<br> You saw me once before.<br> you know that?<br> I did?<br> You wouldn't dance with me.<br> It was at Marlott.<br> Of course!<br> That's incredible!<br> You remember now?<br> Tessy!Tessy!<br> Now my girl.<br> Yes. I may never again be<br> brave enough to tell my story.<br> Then get on with your precious story.<br> I was born at such and such place<br> and in such and such a year...<br> I was born at Marlott and i grew up there.<br> I was in the Sixth Form when I left school.<br> They said that I would make a geed teacher.<br> But there was trouble in my family.<br> Father was no great worker.<br> He drank. Anyway, my parents, they...<br> it was then that something happened.<br> Something which changed my life like.<br> They discovered<br> that we were not Durbeyfields<br> but D'Urbervilles.<br> WEll, go on.<br> WEll, that's it.<br> WEll the D'Urbervilles are an old family.<br> I know<br> On account of being of that<br> name my mother thought that...<br> I was sent...<br> -I had a...<br> -A what?<br> I was told that you hated old families.<br> Is that all the trouble?<br> None of that matters, Tess. Say you'll be my wife.<br> Say it, Tess. SAy it, my dear love!<br> Yes yes yes...<br> my health, my simplicity.<br> I'm a strangeness of my situation.<br> I perhaps lessen my fault.<br> But since I've committed it I am guilty.<br> I must be guilty.<br> Because the lord sawfit to take my child.<br> If what I have just written,<br> failed to pass my lips,<br> in your presence, then I have<br> repeated it a thousand times<br> in my heart. For it was the<br> fear of losing you forever.<br> For love of you,<br> Is hall conquer that fear<br> and bring you this letter<br> Once you are savoured Angel<br> you'll hold the rest<br> of my life in your hands.<br> I hope and I tremble. I love you.<br> Oh darling!<br> I've been assumed to put<br> an edge on my appetite.<br> I'm starving.<br> Angel.<br> Angel please.<br> I must speak to you.<br> What's the matter?<br> I want to confess all my past faults, all of it!<br> Later Sweetheart.Once we are married,<br> we'll tell each other everything.<br> I have some failings of my own to confess!<br> I required and charge you both<br> as you all have to answer<br> at that dreadful day of judgement.<br> Let the secrets of all<br> hearts should be disclosed.<br> If either of you know any impediments<br> why you may not be<br> lawfully joined in matrimony,<br> Ye do now confess.<br> Will thou have this woman<br> for thou wedded wife<br> To live together after<br> god's just ordinance<br> In the holiest state of matrimony,<br> will thou love her, comfort her,<br> honour and keep her in sickness<br> and in health and forsaking<br> all other, keep thee only unto her,<br> so long as ye both shall live?<br> I will.<br> Welcome sir, welcome ma'am.<br> Mr Plunkit told me to make ye at home.<br> The rooms, they are ready.<br> They are on the first floor.<br> Mr Plunkit had to leave for Manchester<br> so you'll have the whole house<br> to yourselves. I hope you<br> are very comfortable here.<br> The house is inclined to be<br> damp but I put a good fire<br> in the drawing room and<br> leave it the afternoon.<br> As for food, look, I've prepared<br> you a cold supper and maybe<br> there's a nice bottle of wine to go with it!<br> Tomorrow, if you wish, I'll<br> bring you some of my husband's<br> excellent cider. He makes it himself.<br> Oh... oh... to use your ups...<br> The... bedroom!<br> A bit of surprise, love.<br> I've totally prepared...<br> my son picked it in the bush.<br> Oh... it's a good bed.<br> I think you'll find that you like it.<br> now i'll leave you to yourselves.<br> cheerio<br> Which are my hands and which are yours?<br> They are all yours.<br> Open it. It's for you.<br> Family jewels.<br> Is this for me?<br> Of course.<br> Truly?<br> Put them on. Put them on now.<br> Oh god, how beautiful you are.<br> Come and see.<br> I have a confession to make my love.<br> You have something to confess?<br> Why not? You think far too highly of me.<br> Now listen. I want you to forgive me.<br> And not be angry with me<br> for failing to tell you earlier.<br> This is nothing for fear of losing you.<br> I shall be brief.<br> Not long before we met,<br> I lived in London for a time.<br> There, I met a woman older<br> than myself. Ours was a flase<br> relationship. A sad one.<br> It was all over in a few weeks.<br> That's all there is to tell.<br> Do you forgive me?<br> Angel, oh, Angel.<br> You are so utterly good and gentle<br> I was mad to fear you'll hate me.<br> I have a confession too Angel.<br> Something of a same kind.<br> Well, tell me at table. WE'll talk over supper.<br> I'm hungry, aren't you?<br> I told you. I have a confession like your own.<br> What confession?<br> I shall be just as brief.<br> His name is D'Urberville like mine.<br> Alexander D'Urberville.<br> His family bought the title.<br> Their real name is Stoke.<br> It was fate that drove me to work<br> for false relations as a way of<br> hoping my own folk to live.<br> Alec, Alexander took advantage of me.<br> Lioness strengh... my defeat.<br> I became his mistress<br> and his affaire without love.<br> Like yours, my sad union<br> ended after a few weeks.<br> We bore a child which died very young.<br> My life was a ruins until the day I met you.<br> I'm going out.<br> If you don't forgive me......<br> but I forgive you, Angel.<br> Yes, I know.<br> But you.... you don't forgive me?<br> You were one person, now you are another.<br> I have mercy.<br> I have mercy.<br> Angel, what do you mean by that laugh?<br> How can you speak to me like this?<br> It frightens me. How can you?<br> You are not the woman I loved.<br> Well, who am I then?<br> Another woman in her shape.<br> It is not the woman I love... but<br> another woman in her shape.<br> Angel, Angel, please.<br> I was a child, a child when it happened.<br> I... I knew nothing of men.<br> You were sinned against. That I grant you.<br> So you don't forgive me.<br> I forgive you, but forgiveness isn't all.<br> You don't love me.<br> I can not help associating your lack<br> of firmness with thedecline of your family.<br> Decrepid families imply indeficient<br> will-power and indecadent conduct.<br> I thought you were a child of nature.<br> But you are the last in the line<br> of degenerate aristocrats.<br> Breakfast is ready.<br> You can get rid of me.<br> What did you say?<br> You can get rid of me.<br> You won't see me.<br> Good god.<br> How can you be so simple?<br> You are too much of a child.<br> Too immature.<br> Too ignorant I suppose.<br> Leave that!<br> You are my wife, not my servant.<br> I am your wife but you<br> don't want to live with me.<br> You are going to go, aren't you?<br> I couldn't stay without despising myself<br> which is worse than despising you.<br> How can we live together<br> while that man exists?<br> He is your natural husband. Not I.<br> Can you honestly tell me to stay?<br> No.<br> But it's absolutely necessary<br> that one of us remain here<br> to avoid a scandal.<br> We must at least keep up appearances.<br> Oh yes we must.<br> What will you do?<br> I can go home.<br> You sure?<br> If you leave me, I shall go home.<br> Certainly.<br> Cross-in-hands, sir.<br> Yes I know.<br> Come<br> Now let's be clear about this.<br> There's no anger in our hearts.<br> Even though something<br> has happened between us<br> which I cannot endure at present.<br> I shall let you know where I go<br> and if I think i can<br> bare it, if I'm capable of it,<br> I shall come to fetch you.<br> I shall wait.<br> Until then, you'd do better<br> not to try and join me.<br> Until then, I must not join you.<br> May I write to you?<br> Oh yes. If you are ill<br> or in need of anything.<br> Ha very good day to you Mr Clare.<br> I've brought you some groceries.<br> There is some chicken,<br> come sausages and bacon.<br> Thank you, thank you so much.<br> I've also brought you some butter,<br> some flour, a dozen eggs<br> But that's far too much.<br> Newly-weds are always hungry sir!<br> From tonight onwards,<br> I shall cook for you myself.<br> The truth is, you see, for sometime<br> I shall be needing less than<br> that, because, infact,<br> I shall be alone for a day or two.<br> My wife has been obliged<br> to rejoin her parents.<br> Was there any illness in the family?<br> No no nothing of that kind.<br> It was all arranged beforehand.<br> So as far as all my meals<br> are concerned during Mrs. Clare's<br> absence, I'll talk of that later.<br> Well shall... shall I leave the basket?<br> Yes, indeed... the basket'll do for the day.<br> I was passing on my way home sir.<br> WE wanted to wish you well.<br> You and Mrs. Clare.<br> She's not here.<br> I'm on the point of leaving<br> myself as you see.<br> I'm leaving England.<br> I've made up my mind to go to Brazil.<br> Brazil?

I shall try to forget you.<br> All I ever received of<br> your hands is injustice.<br> Mr Durbeyfield.<br> Beg your pardon?<br> You are Mr Durbeyfield?<br> They don't live here no more.<br> Since when?<br> Since John Durbeyfield died.<br> Do you know where they went?<br> Durbeyfield... from 1832 to 1888<br> more properly D'Urberville of once<br> powerful family of that name<br> and directly descended<br> through illustrious lines<br> of Pagan D'Urberville.<br> Likes of a conqueror.<br> How are the mighty fallen?<br> Ah yes... how indeed.<br> May I? for the poor.<br> I prefer to settle<br> the Mason's account.<br> You'd think he's never<br> been paid for his work.<br> They were an odd family.<br> My collegue Mr Tringham,<br> would have done<br> better to have kept his mouth shut.<br> I should like to see Mrs Clare.<br> Tess<br> Yes I know. She's not here.<br> You are Mrs. Durbeyfield.<br> Yes<br> Where is she living?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm her husband.<br> I guessed as much.<br> Then tell me where she is.<br> Please, tell me.<br> Leave her.

Never.<br> Mrs Durbeyfield,<br> take pity on a lonely,<br> wretched man.<br> Tell me where to find her.<br> I beg you.<br> She's at Sandbourne.<br> Sandbourne? But where?<br> It's a large town these days.<br> That's all I know. Sandbourne.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm looking for a Mrs. Clare.<br> Would you by any<br> chance know her address?<br> Ah, George. You got a Clare around?<br> No... we've had a lot of<br> visitors here. You know.<br> Or Durbeyfield. Miss Durbeyfield.<br> D'Urberville at the Herons.<br> That's it. D'Urberville.<br> It's a boarding house sir. Can't miss it.<br> Where abouts?<br> Yes?<br> Please excuse me<br> for calling at this hour.<br> But do you have a Teresa<br> D'Urberville staying in your board?<br> Mrs D'Urberville you mean?<br> Yes.<br> Please come in.<br> Would be kind enough to<br> tell her that her relative<br> is anxious to see her?<br> It's rather early sir. What name shall I give?<br> Angel.<br> Mr Angel?<br> Angel. It's my christian name.<br> She'll understand.<br> I'll go and see if she's awake.<br> Tess. I came to ask your forgiveness.<br> It's too late.<br> Too late? My darling wife.<br> I've come to fetch you.<br> I'm going to...<br> Don't come near me Angel please.<br> Too Late. Too Late.<br> I'm not the man I was. I've suffered too.<br> I humbly beg you to forgive me.<br> Yes. yes... But I tell you it's too late.<br> Don't you know at all? Don't you?<br> How did you find your way here?<br> I saw your mother.<br> I waited and waited for you.<br> But you didn't come.<br> I wrote to you. But you didn't come.<br> He has been good tome.<br> To all of us.<br> He's won me back to him.<br> He's upstairs.<br> Go now Angel. Go please.<br> Never come back anymore.<br> Good morning my dear<br> WEll, what's the matter now?<br> You feeling unwell?<br> Is that why you have the vapours?<br> Yes? No?<br> yes I know. You are moping as usual.<br> For god's sake, try and make an effort.<br> Did you have a bad dream?<br> Brazil perhaps?<br> These mooning hysterics<br> of yours are in poor taste.<br> Don't forget we are<br> lunching with the Bennets.<br> I'd like you to look presentable.<br> A genuine D'Urberville.<br> I came to tell you that I killed him.<br> I've done it.<br> I don't know how<br> I don't know.<br> I tried to rake him with my glove put<br> the blood in his mouth<br> I thought I might be capable of it<br> Yes... yes. It was from that day on<br> What's mean?<br> I've killed him<br> I won't desert you.<br> I shall protect you by<br> every means in my power.<br> Whatever you may or may<br> not have done, I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Will they hang me?<br> WE must get out at the next<br> station and head north on foot.<br> They'll be looking for us at the Wessex ports.<br> Once we reach the north<br> we'll go abroad.<br> WE have makings of a mule here.<br> and a bottle of wine.<br> Rest at last.<br> We must leave at once.<br> WE must leave here as soon as possible.<br> My life couldn't be a matter of weeks?<br> Why not wait for them here?<br> Since they'll catch me in any case.<br> I'm going to save you.<br> Do you hear?<br> I'm going to save you.<br> Can't we rest here?<br> I'm afraid not. By day this place<br> is visible from miles around.<br> There are no stars tonight.<br> Perhaps we could have made<br> our souls take flight together.<br> Do they sacrifice to god here?<br> No . To the sun I believe. It's a Pagan temple.<br> Older than the ages.<br> Older than the D'Urbervilles.<br> Do you think we shall meet again after death?<br> I'm afraid Angel. I'm afraid.<br> There's no use sir.<br> The whole country's roused.<br> She's sleeping. Just a little longer.<br> Have they come for me?<br> Yes.<br> I'm ready.<br>
