What else do you do<br> When there's nothing to do?<br> It's easy to be gallant<br> When you're doomed.<br> What do you mean,<br> Doomed?<br> You should<br> Ask me that.<br> Who said I was a sucker<br> When he was on fire?<br> I've had 5 days<br> To think, haven't I?<br> Don't you think I know<br> He has to get drunk?<br> Don't you think I can think with you?<br> And don't you think, Mr.<br> Gunner, I've tried to walk out?<br> I've got a ticket in<br> My pocketbook, even.<br> I've packed my bag so<br> Many times it's worn out,<br> But I didn't go,<br> And now I'm going<br> To be drunk to.<br> But, ann, you shouldn't<br> Think like that,<br> Because<br> - because it's no way to think. It's crazy.<br> Well,<br> This is crazier.<br> Doom at the end of each.<br> Suppose<br> He didn't drink,<br> He slapped her<br> Back again,<br> And he sits around, his<br> Nerves screaming with triumph.<br> He sits around<br> Drinking sarsaparilla with ann-me.<br> How he would<br> Love me.<br> The second road<br> Is worse than that.<br> He's retired from flying<br> And works on the ground.<br> Imagine a man with<br> His heart in the sky<br> Living with a woman<br> On the ground.<br> He wouldn't like<br> Himself very much,<br> And I wouldn't like him, either, gunner.<br> Oh, no. He's in love<br> With a woman with wings.<br> She's got him. I've<br> No way to cut her out.<br> But there's<br> Another road.<br> Yes, there is,<br> And we're on it.<br> We go on as if nothing had happened.<br> He goes in the next race, another bat,<br> Another race,<br> Another bat,<br> Until someday, when he's<br> Not quite so young and quick,<br> She slaps him out,<br> And Mrs. Benson takes<br> Another man home on the train.<br> How do you like it?<br> You know, don't you?<br> No, no, I don't know. I've<br> Only had it for 10 years,<br> And you hit it right<br> On the nose, too.<br> You just sit<br> And wait for it.<br> What do I do it for?<br> Because there's nothing<br> Else to do. He gets you.<br> There's no fun being<br> With anybody else.<br> What's fun about waiting<br> For somebody to die?<br> Every ticktock<br> Of the clock-<br> Still living,<br> Still living,<br> Still living,<br> Still living.<br> What for?<br> I won't do it.<br> I won't love him<br> That much.<br> What do you think<br> I'm made of?<br> How can you expect<br> Me to do that?<br> You didn't say<br> I was a sucker.<br> You said I was the champion of them.<br> Well, I won't be.<br> Haven't I the right<br> To live my life<br> Without being tortured every second?<br> Haven't I?<br> Haven't I?!<br> What's the matter?<br> I'm leaving you, that's what<br> It is, on the next train.<br> You'll never<br> See me again.<br> Don't blow on me, ann.<br> Right now.<br> Give me a chance to make<br> Up for this, will you? No.<br> Come on. Give me a chance. I'm<br> Not used to being married yet.<br> No.<br> But I'll pick up.<br> I never asked anybody<br> To do anything<br> For me before.<br> That's a good start,<br> Isn't it, ann?<br> I won't do it.<br> I've been looking forward to<br> Seeing you all day. Ask the gunner.<br> I don't care.<br> And listen, dear, I'm going to<br> Prove a lot of things to you.<br> We started on that<br> Last party together.<br> I can see your face<br> Before me right now,<br> Sitting there<br> Through all that smoke.<br> We were even flirting,<br> Weren't we? Sure we were.<br> That party is going to<br> End up with you.<br> You go in the kitchen<br> And make some sandwiches,<br> And we'll make believe there<br> Were no 5 days in between.<br> Just you and I<br> On a little blowoff.<br> See the idea of it, ann?<br> Please see.<br> No.<br> Take it easy, pal.<br> It's all right. You<br> Can't blame her, I guess.<br> All that talk of sweden<br> And all that.<br> You know those things<br> Are disappointing.<br> And she tried hard<br> To forgive me, didn't she?<br> I wish she hadn't made me<br> Believe it, though.<br> She was kind of sweet the<br> Way she talked at first.<br> Well, that's all right.<br> A lot of angles<br> To it, boy.<br> Yeah? There's just<br> One angle to it, boy-<br> She doesn't love me as much<br> As I thought she did.<br> That's the ticket when<br> You get right down to it,<br> And there's nothing<br> You can do about that.<br> Yeah, and that's<br> All right, too.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Yeah? Well,<br> She fooled me good.<br> I thought I rated higher<br> Than a few days drunk.<br> I'm sorry I asked her<br> To stay now,<br> Because I did ask her. You<br> Were in the room. You heard me.<br> I actually asked her<br> To stay.<br> I did something I never<br> Did before in my life-<br> I begged a girl<br> To be my girl. Hmm!<br> And I didn't beg her once.<br> I begged her twice.<br> Me! A little country girl<br> Off of a kansas farm,<br> And I begged her.<br> I ought to go in there<br> And tell her right now!<br> I'm packed.<br> See all my things?<br> You just happened<br> To come back<br> At the wrong<br> Moment, dear.<br> I was telling gunner how<br> Lonesome I was, that's all.<br> After this,<br> I'll understand.<br> Your life is yours, and the<br> Loudest applause you'll hear of all<br> Will be me in the stands.<br> So, do you still want me<br> To come to the party?<br> I'll make a cheese sandwich if you do.<br> I do that very well.<br> Gee, I'm glad<br> To see you, crazy.<br> Did you really see my<br> Face through the smoke?<br> How's your sky girl? Have you<br> Slapped her since I've seen you?<br> Yes, dear.<br> I know you don't want me<br> To get out of here now.<br> There's that funny look coming over<br> Your funny mug<br> Again.<br> See it, gunner?<br> I don't see why that's<br> Funnier than any other.<br> See? Gunner thinks<br> You're funny, too.<br> You're a big clown,<br> Baby.<br> No other face ever made me<br> Laugh so much before.<br> And she calls me crazy. I ask you.<br> Listen, nuts, I'm going to<br> Do more than look at you.<br> I'm going to<br> Settle down.<br> Yeah. I'm going to surprise<br> You. I'm going to settle down.<br> How, dear?<br> Settle how?<br> Just the way you want it. Jim.<br> I'm going to get<br> That dough back<br> So fast you won't know<br> What hit you.<br> Drake's got jobs that<br> No one wants any part of,<br> All the way from pursuit<br> Jobs to seaplanes.<br> That-a boy. That's a cute<br> Little place to settle down.<br> What do you<br> Mean, pal?<br> I mean, right in the middle<br> Of the atlantic ocean.<br> Oh. Say, who do you love, kansas?<br> You, so help me, the whole ocean full.<br> I'm so crazy<br> About you.<br> Yes. I'm nuts.<br> I must be.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> I wish you could have<br> Seen Drake's face<br> When I told him I was settling<br> Down. He thought I was drunk.<br> You're not fooling<br> Anybody.<br> Wrap it tight, pal. I'm going to<br> Give it the works up there today,<br> And I don't want it<br> To pop open.<br> I'll wrap them.<br> You fly them.<br> What's eating on you? You think<br> I'm going to get drunk tonight, too?<br> You think so?<br> I didn't say that.<br> No. You didn't say<br> Anything.<br> Listen, I meant every word<br> I told her last night.<br> From now on, I'm going to<br> Attend to business.<br> I used to take jobs<br> When I felt like it,<br> But from now on, I'm going to<br> Take anything that comes along,<br> And all the dough<br> - I'm going to put it right in her lap.<br> Will that<br> Please her! Baby!<br> Do you really want<br> To please her?<br> Just watch me.<br> Quit flying and go<br> Into a shoe store.<br> Did she tell you that?<br> I'm just<br> Saying that.<br> Yeah, and you're just<br> Saying nothing, as usual.<br> That just shows you<br> What you know about women.<br> A shoe store! I should give up<br> The trade I love for a woman.<br> She'd hate me.<br> You heard what she said-<br> She'd be the loudest<br> Applause of all.<br> Why don't you go<br> Drown yourself?<br> Is that<br> Tight enough?<br> Yeah, but I'm not<br> Going to be tonight.<br> I'm going to take her<br> To a show instead.<br> And who do you love,<br> Honey?<br> I love you.<br> Yeah,<br> And I love you, too.<br> Come on.<br> Cut it out!<br> Sweetheart,<br> You didn't kiss me.<br> Come on. Let's go<br> And kiss the army.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> Well! He's<br> Getting even<br> To look like<br> A gentleman,<br> Isn't he,<br> Gunner?<br> He's got that settled-down look.<br> Do you play<br> Bridge, Jim?<br> It's an idea.<br> I'll learn.<br> Ah, come to the house any evening.<br> Glad to.<br> Will you come<br> To dinner?<br> Fine.<br> White tie?<br> Right.<br> White tie!<br> Ah, general!<br> Well, you knew I'd make it somehow, huh?<br> Well, I had the idea.<br> Well, well, well,<br> Well, well!<br> Hello, general.<br> I haven't seen you<br> Since you left the army.<br> How are they doing?<br> I might forget<br> A lot of things<br> If you want<br> To come back.<br> I've still got<br> Insomnia.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Oh, Lane.<br> Yeah?<br> Drake has probably told<br> You everything but this-<br> This test is more important to<br> The army than it is to Drake.<br> Drake will sell a lot of ships<br> If you win. That lets him out.<br> But the army needs a new pursuit<br> Speed. We've got to have it.<br> Who are you chasing,<br> General?<br> Wait'll you see<br> What we've got.<br> It's a shame to bust up<br> A pretty bird like this,<br> But you've got to<br> Do it for us.<br> We must find out<br> What that speed is.<br> She'll move,<br> General.<br> I hope so. I saw billy hogan<br> Bringing the other one down.<br> She wasn't loafing,<br> Either,<br> But hogan wasn't alive<br> To tell us.<br> I shouldn't be telling<br> You this, I suppose.<br> Why general, you're giving me<br> The jitters.<br> What do you expect of<br> Those army aviators?<br> Anyway, I'll kiss the<br> Wings good-bye at 3,000<br> And have all the dough<br> For you, ok, general?<br> Come out alive, boy.<br> Yeah. Sure.<br> You should see her.<br> Thank you.<br> Thought you were<br> Going to stay home.<br> That's worse.<br> I'd rather see it, even.<br> Do they go that high<br> Always?<br> That's the idea of it.<br> They got to get a start.<br> How bad is it?<br> As bad as I gathered?<br> Remember,<br> We don't act.<br> I don't know, ann.<br> That's right.<br> Don't kid me.<br> Here he comes!<br> I wish he were home. No, I<br> Don't, either. Come on, Jim!<br> Wouldn't it be funny<br> If it rained?<br> If it rained now,<br> We'd all get wet,<br> And he's got<br> An umbrella.<br> Thanks.<br> You ok?<br> Yes, yes.<br> Go on home.<br> You all right, Jim?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Ok, read it<br> Yourself.<br> Yeah. Wait till you see the<br> Whites of their eyes, gentlemen.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Come on. Take<br> A little more.<br> Good. That's fine.<br> He's all right.<br> You mean it?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Don't tell him.<br> I won't, pal.<br> Thanks.<br> I'll go find him.<br> All right, pal.<br> Well, well!

Then how about<br> Reaching for that, pal?<br> Ooh. $4,000.<br> How's that?<br> Oh, well.<br> Well, look again.<br> It isn't mine.<br> It's made out to me.<br> Yeah, and there's a lot more<br> Coming in that same parade.<br> Didn't I tell you things<br> Were going to be different?<br> And you know what I'm<br> Going to do tonight?<br> I'm going to take<br> You to a show,<br> And then I'm going<br> Home like a gentleman-<br> I mean, like a husband. What do I mean?<br> The whole idea's<br> Got me groggy.<br> Me, too, but I'm not going to<br> Be any more groggier about you.<br> I don't care<br> How sweet you are.huh?<br> I'm stuck on you enough,<br> And that's enough, see?<br> Stuck on me, huh?<br> Yes, I'm stuck on you. And<br> Now I'm going to drink to you.<br> Here's to your mother,<br> Here's to your father,<br> And here's to the best aviator<br> In the entire cockeyed world.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Still living...<br> Still living...

I'll get used<br> To it in time. Give me time.<br> I don't mean that either. I'm grabbing<br> What I can. What do you want me to do?<br> I don't know.<br> Gunner, don't<br> Ever fall in love.<br> Don't ever<br> Fall in love.<br> You know what goes<br> Good with peanuts?<br> What, outside<br> Of you?<br> Champagne.<br> Yeah?

That's the idea, isn't it?<br> You're<br> A tough man.<br> How else do you figure it? And<br> Listen, I haven't started yet.<br> I'll go back up there.<br> I'm going back up there to pay the<br> Sky back for what she did to me today.<br> I'll pay her back.<br> I'll wring her neck!<br> And I'll show ann something she<br> Won't forget in a hurry either!<br> I'll show her!

I don't<br> Know what came off.<br> She's going screwy,<br> I guess. I don't know.<br> Maybe she's<br> In love with you.<br> Hmm. You should have been there.<br> It sounded more like she hated me.<br> If she doesn't love you, she's got<br> A mighty funny way of showing it.<br> You should have been with us<br> This morning after you went up.<br> When the general<br> Asked her for lunch,<br> She said until you<br> Came down, she was dead.<br> Did she say that?<br> Yes, sir. That's<br> Just what she said.<br> She's a nice girl.
