What kind?<br> Well, guides for businessmen...<br> ...people just like you, I guess.<br> Accidental Tourist.<br> - Why, yes.<br> - Really? Am I right?<br> Well, what do you know?<br> Look at this:<br> Gray suit. Just what you recommend.<br> Appropriate for all occasions.<br> See my luggage?<br> Carryon. Change of underwear,<br> clean shirt, packet of detergent powder.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - You're my hero.<br> You've improved my trips 100 percent.<br> I tell my wife, Going with the Accidental<br> Tourist is like going in a cocoon.<br> Well, this is very nice to hear.<br> Times I've flown clear to Oregon<br> and hardly knew I left Baltimore.<br> Excellent.<br> I see you have your book<br> for protection there.<br> Didn't work with me, though, did it?<br> Edward, how you doing, boy?<br> - Hello, Sarah.<br> - Hello, Macon.<br> - You made good time from the airport.<br> - We landed early...<br> ...even with the storm.<br> - I made you some tea.<br> - Well, that's very nice of you, Sarah.<br> So how was Atlanta?<br> About the same.<br> Peachtree Road, Peachtree Centre,<br> Peachtree Fire Hydrant.<br> Come on. Come on, Edward.<br> Hello, Edward.<br> He's a boy.<br> How's your ears?<br> Okay.<br> I think he still expects Ethan<br> to come home, even after a year.<br> Macon?<br> Macon.<br> You know I love you.<br> But I can't live with you anymore.<br> What?<br> What did you say?<br> I want a divorce, Macon.<br> I rented an apartment downtown.<br> Honey, listen, it's been a hard year.<br> We've had a hard time.<br> People who lose a child<br> often feeI this way.<br> It puts a terrible strain<br> on a marriage...<br> ...but it doesn't have to tear us apart.<br> Listen, I've been thinking...<br> ...have you considered<br> having another baby?<br> - Oh, Macon.<br> - I know we can't replace Ethan, but-<br> No, I'm sorry. It would never work.<br> All right, forget that.<br> It was a crazy idea, right?<br> Crazy notion, but...<br> AII I'm saying is, we can start over.<br> Macon, ever since Ethan died, I've had<br> to admit that people are basically bad.<br> EviI, Macon.<br> They're so eviI they'd take<br> our 12-year-old boy...<br> ...and shoot him through the skull<br> for no reason.<br> There have been times<br> I haven't been sure I-<br> Haven't been sure I could live<br> in this kind of world anymore.<br> It's true what you say<br> about human beings.<br> I'm not trying to argue.<br> Tell me, Sarah, why would<br> that cause you to leave me?<br> Because I knew you wouldn't<br> try and argue.<br> You believed all along they were eviI.<br> This whole past year I've felt myself<br> withdrawing from people...<br> ...just like you do, Macon.<br> I've felt myself becoming a Leary.<br> Well, there are worse disasters<br> than that, I guess.<br> Not for me.<br> Macon, I know you loved Ethan.<br> And I know you mourn him,<br> but there's something so...<br> What do you call it?<br> Muffled about the way<br> you experience things.<br> It's like you're trying to slip<br> through life unchanged.<br> Sarah, I'm not muffled.<br> I endure. I'm holding steady.<br> I know you think that,<br> but I think you're fooling yourself.<br> It's not by chance you write books telling<br> people how to make trips without a jolt...<br> ...so they can travel to wonderfuI, exotic<br> places and never be touched by them.<br> Never feeI they've left home.<br> That travelling armchair isn't<br> just your logo. It's you.<br> No, it's not. It's not.<br> When Ethan was in this house with us,<br> we were all right.<br> If there was a distance between us, it<br> didn't matter. We had Ethan in common.<br> But when we lost him, I needed you.<br> I needed you to comfort me.<br> I needed you to be the kind of person<br> you've never been...<br> ...and that isn't even fair to ask of you.<br> That's why I have to go.<br> - Sarah-<br> - Don't fight this, Macon.<br> I don't know<br> how much strength I've got.<br> I'm never gonna recover from<br> Ethan's death. I don't expect it.<br> But there's a chance that I could<br> make a life anyway.<br> But my only hope<br> is to get out of here...<br> ...away from you.<br> Let me go.<br> In the Southeast they say<br> that if you want to go to heaven...<br> ...you have to change planes<br> in Atlanta.<br> The airport in Atlanta must have<br> Come or go, Edward.<br> Oh, make up your mind.<br> I could stop by and pick up the rug<br> on Saturday, if that's convenient.<br> Well, I leave for England<br> tomorrow afternoon.<br> Maybe I could bring the rug over.<br> Or I could let myself in on Saturday.<br> I should have agreed to teach<br> summer schooI or something.<br> Open my eyes in the morning and I think,<br> Why bother getting up?<br> Why bother eating?<br> Why bother breathing?<br> Me too, sweetheart.<br> Mr. Leary, come with me, please,<br> to identify the body.<br> Yes, that is my son.<br> So I guess I'll come by<br> while you're gone, if that's all right.<br> Oh, sorry.<br> Come on, Edward.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> - Hi there.<br> - Do you board dogs?<br> - Sure.<br> - I'd like to board Edward here.<br> - Do you have a reservation?<br> - A reservation? No.<br> - Most people reserve.<br> - Could you make an exception?<br> I've just come from the place<br> we've used before.<br> Suddenly they tell me they can't take<br> him, that he bit someone last time.<br> Edward, do you bite?<br> How could you do such a thing?<br> I'm catching a plane.<br> I'm leaving for a week...<br> ...and I don't have a souI to look<br> after him. I'm desperate, I tell you.<br> - Can't you leave home with your wife?<br> - No.<br> - You're not married?<br> - I am, but she's living elsewhere.<br> They don't allow pets.<br> I'm a divorcee myself.<br> I know what you're going through.<br> So will you keep him?<br> I guess, if you're desperate.<br> Fill this out. Your name and address<br> and when you'll be back.<br> Don't forget to put when you'll be back.<br> I'll most likely see you again<br> when you pick him up...<br> ...if you put the time of day<br> to expect you.<br> My name is MurieI.<br> Is this place open evenings?<br> - Every evening but Sundays, till 8.<br> - Oh, good.<br> MurieI Pritchett.<br> In London, England, I recommend<br> the Underground...<br> ...for everyone except those<br> afraid of heights...<br> ...and even for them, if they will avoid<br> the following stations.<br> It's mystifying why all hotels<br> throughout the world choose only...<br> ...the most abrasive fabrics<br> for their bedspreads.<br> London is among<br> the better foreign destinations...<br> ...in the important category<br> of hotel plumbing.<br> The British have only mixed success<br> with American cuisine...<br> ...but the traveller with persistence<br> can find a meal in London...<br> ...not much different from a meal<br> in Cleveland.<br> Here you are, guvnor.<br> Just as sold at the Yankee Stadium.<br> Have a nice day.<br> - Can I help you?<br> - I'm here for my dog.<br> - Your last name?<br> - Leary.<br> Oh, just a minute.<br> Hi there. How was your trip?<br> Oh, it was...<br> Where's Edward? Is he all right?<br> Sure, he's all right.<br> We got on like a house afire.<br> Seems he took a shine to me.<br> I couldn't say why.<br> That's wonderfuI. So...<br> - ...could I have him back, please?<br> - Caroline will bring him.<br> - Maybe I could pay.<br> - Yes.<br> That will be $42.<br> Thank you.<br> Signature and phone.<br> I don't know if I mentioned before<br> that it so happens I train dogs.<br> Is that right?<br> - That home phone or your business?<br> - Both.<br> Why? What difference does it make?<br> I was just wondering.<br> My speciality is dogs that bite.<br> Specialty. Webster prefers specialty.<br> - That must be dangerous.<br> - Not for me. I can handle anything...<br> ...dogs that haven't been treated right,<br> even split personality.<br> - Split personality?<br> - Your dog is nice to you but kills others.<br> - Come on.<br> - Not that he would bite me.<br> - He just fell in love with me.<br> - I'm glad to hear it.<br> I could train him<br> not to bite other people.<br> Think about it and give me a call.<br> MurieI, remember?<br> MurieI Pritchett.<br> Let me give you my card.<br> Oh, well, I'll bear that in mind.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Or just call for no reason. Call and talk.<br> - Talk?<br> - Sure.<br> Talk about Edward, his problems.<br> Talk about anything.<br> - Don't you ever get the urge to do that?<br> - Not really.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Dad?<br> Dad?<br> Ethan?<br> Where are you?<br> I'm at camp, Dad.<br> You never came to get me.<br> But we thought you were dead.<br> Why would you think that?<br> We have, coming up,<br> brand-new pieces of gold...<br> ...brand-new Capodimonte<br> and two gorgeous rings.<br> Bob, guess what ring I have.<br> My mom's and my favourite...<br> ...this is the beautiful<br> one-carat diamond swirl cluster ring.<br> Take a look at this ring.<br> It is gorgeous. I have the-<br> - Leary.<br> - Macon, it's Muriel.<br> - MurieI?<br> - Muriel Pritchett.<br> Oh, yes.<br> From the vet's, who got on so good<br> with your dog.<br> - Oh, right.<br> - I was just wondering how Edward was.<br> - Looks all right to me.<br> - No problems?<br> Well, he's developed this new symptom.<br> He gets angry when I leave the house.<br> He starts barking and showing his teeth.<br> He ought to be trained.<br> Tell you what, maybe I could just<br> come around and discuss it.<br> - I don't think-<br> - Or you could come to my place.<br> I'd fix you supper.<br> Macon, what do you say?<br> I think for now I'll just try<br> to manage on my own.<br> Well, I can understand that.<br> Believe me, I've been through that stage.<br> So, what I'll do is, I'll wait for you<br> to get in touch.<br> Yes, that would be good.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - I don't wanna be pushy-<br> This is a porcelain rocking horse<br> and a music box.<br> This is handcrafted porcelain.<br> Hand-painted and gorgeous.<br> Nine inches high. $59, a very low-<br> If you wanna come down, come.<br> Otherwise, go away...<br> ...but stop that pitifuI whimpering.<br> This basement is not haunted.<br> That ought to do nicely.<br> Buck up.<br> That's the stuff, Edward.<br> Don't give up, Edward. We can make it.<br> Come on.<br> There is something elementally<br> comforting to the business traveller...<br> ...about that moment when his flight<br> touches down once again...<br> ...at his own airport.<br> After a demanding journey,<br> even the most impersonal terminal...<br> ...can seem as welcoming<br> as an ancestral home.<br> I don't think anyone else<br> has any idea where I am.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I've come over here to stay for a while.<br> - Does it matter?<br> - Should you tell Sarah?<br> It's nice to be so...<br> ...unconnected.<br> I wish things could stay that way.<br> Why can't they?<br> Well, you know, someone will call here,<br> Sarah or someone.<br> - We could just not answer the phone.<br> - What? Let it ring?<br> Why not?<br> Not answer it ever?<br> Most who call me are neighbours.<br> They'll pop over if no one answers.<br> I won't miss it.<br> Let it ring.<br> You stinker!<br> Hypodermic.<br> You're a reaI stinker, Rose.<br> Disinfectant.<br> - You got it.<br> - I know.<br> Doctors and nurses.<br> Nurse.<br> There you go.<br> Down! Down, dog!<br> Macon!<br> Help!<br> Call him off, damn it!<br> Edward!<br> Call off your dog!<br> Edward, stop that. Who is that?<br> This is your employer, Macon.<br> Julian?<br> Come here, Edward.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Come here.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> I really hate a man<br> with an obnoxious dog.<br> I don't hate just the dog,<br> I hate the owner.<br> I'm sorry about this. I thought he was<br> off on a walk with my brother, Porter.<br> - What happened to your leg?<br> - I broke it.<br> I can see that. But how?<br> Well, it's kind of hard to explain.<br> How did you find me here?<br> From the return address<br> on the chapters you sent me.<br> Very interesting.<br> Do you realize how late you're running<br> with this guidebook?<br> Edward, cut it out!<br> This is quite a place.<br> It was my grandparents' house.<br> I grew up here.<br> Where's Sarah?<br> - Who?<br> - Your wife, Macon.<br> Oh, she and I are...<br> She has this...<br> ...apartment downtown.<br> You've split?<br> Yeah.<br> Jesus, Macon.<br> - What went wrong?<br> - Nothing.<br> It turns out these things can happen<br> for no particular reason.<br> Hush, now.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Julian Hedge, this is my sister, Rose,<br> and my other brother, Charles.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Here, let me help you with that.<br> - Charles, how do you do?<br> - Hello.<br> Macon Leary with a sister<br> and brothers too.<br> Who would've guessed?<br> That Macon Leary had a family...<br> ...just never entered my mind somehow.<br> I'm right here, Julian.<br> Yes, I do see a family resemblance.<br> You're Macon's publisher. I'm the one<br> who mailed you Macon's chapters.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - I'm supposed to send you some more...<br> ...but first I have to buy 9 by 12<br> envelopes. All we've got left is 10 by 13.<br> It's terrible when things<br> don't fit precisely.<br> They get all out of alignment.<br> We wouldn't wanna keep you, Rose.<br> Oh, no. Here, I'll take that.<br> The Macon Leary 9 by 12 envelope crisis.<br> Oh, Julian, drop it.<br> Sorry.<br> You know, Macon, if you'd just let me<br> know what was going on in your life.<br> I had no idea.<br> Look, if you want another-<br> I don't know, another month?<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> What's a missing wife or two, right?<br> Here, let me get what I've typed<br> and you can check it.<br> Just what I thought.<br> You monster, do you know how long<br> I've been looking for you?<br> Great.<br> Call it something catchy.<br> The Reluctant Tourist.<br> And you are the fella<br> to write it.<br> But I hate to travel.<br> I thought so.<br> So do businessmen.<br> They would rather be at home<br> in their living rooms.<br> So you will be helping them<br> to pretend...<br> ...that that's where they are.<br> What do you think?<br> Your logo. You get it?<br> While armchair travellers<br> dream of going places...<br> ...travelling armchairs<br> dream of staying put.<br> After this, I want you to start<br> on New York and the Northeast again.<br> So soon?<br> It's been three years, Macon.<br> Edward! Stop it!<br> Macon, did he get you?<br> - I wouldn't have a dog like that.<br> - He's never done that.<br> I'd call the SPCA or the dogcatcher.<br> Tell them you want him done away with.<br> Just go, Julian.<br> Hold on, hold on.<br> We have a couple more limas.<br> Yeah, we do.<br> What do we have next?<br> Now I need M's or N's,<br> anything starting with those.<br> Then how about these noodles?<br> N for noodles.<br> P for pasta?<br> E for elbow macaroni. You might<br> have passed those up earlier, Porter.<br> Rose?<br> Rose?<br> It seems Edward's given me<br> a little sort of nip.<br> - Oh, Macon.<br> - How did it happen?<br> It was an accident,<br> but I think I need an antiseptic.<br> - You need a tetanus shot.<br> - You need to get rid of that dog.<br> He didn't mean any harm.<br> Takes your hand off<br> and he means no harm?<br> You should get rid of him, I tell you.<br> - Well, I can't.<br> - Why not?<br> Come on, boy. Yeah!<br> Ethan, you think<br> you could do that outside?<br> Right.<br> I just can't get rid of him,<br> that's all.<br> Macon, come sit down.<br> Let me see what I have.<br> Maybe we could send him<br> to obedience schooI.<br> Edward, sit.<br> Now, you kind of cluck<br> your tongue.<br> They get to know a cluck means praise.<br> When I hold my hand out, see...<br> ...that means he has to stay.<br> Stay.<br> That was very good.<br> He's supposed to wear this<br> till he's trained.<br> That way, you can yank him back<br> whenever he does something wrong.<br> Here you go.<br> Make him sit.<br> Sit.<br> Poke him down.<br> - He doesn't take you seriously.<br> - I know that.<br> Years ago, I saw this ad in the paper:<br> Make extra money in your off-hours.<br> A dog-training firm<br> that went to people's houses.<br> Doggie Do, it was called.<br> Don't you just hate that name?<br> Who's the lady?<br> Lady?<br> I saw a lady walking<br> through the kitchen.<br> Oh, that's Rose.<br> - Is she your ex-wife, or what?<br> - She's my sister.<br> Your sister.<br> This house belongs to her.<br> I don't live with anybody either.<br> You can release him now.<br> Pardon?<br> Release your dog.<br> What do you do for a living?<br> I write.<br> - Travel guidebooks.<br> - Travel guides!<br> Lucky. I love to travel.<br> Oh, travel.<br> It's just red tape, mostly.<br> Ticket lines, customs lines.<br> Should Edward be barking that way?<br> If I could go anywhere,<br> I'd go to Paris.<br> It sounds so romantic.<br> Paris, actually, is terrible.<br> Everybody's impolite.<br> Take me with you next time.<br> I could show you the good parts.<br> I have a very limited expense account.<br> I never even took my wife.<br> My wife.<br> I was only teasing.<br> You think I meant it?<br> Oh, no.<br> That'll be $ 14.40, including<br> the leash and the choke chain.<br> You have to practice what he's learned.<br> No one else can practice for you.<br> You can pay me the other<br> Sit.<br> Are you absolutely clear about this?<br> Yes. I know exactly where we are.<br> I have the address right here.<br> - Now, I'll be back in one half hour.<br> - Are you sure?<br> Macon, please. I'm just going<br> around the corner. Now, goodbye.<br> The Accidental Tourist on Crutches.<br> I guess I'll be going.<br> My sister's picking me up.<br> Rose? She's coming here?<br> I'd like to see her.<br> Macon, do me a favour.<br> Couldn't you invite me<br> to a family dinner?<br> Well, we're really not much<br> for socializing.<br> Wouldn't have to be anything fancy,<br> just whatever you eat normally.<br> What do you eat, normally?<br> Or I'll bring the meaI myself.<br> You could lock up your dog<br> and I'll come spend the evening.<br> We'll see.<br> Whenever my dad said that,<br> it meant no.<br> When I was in high schooI,<br> I made nothing but A's.<br> You're surprised at that, aren't you?<br> Now, this is the heeI command.<br> You think I'm kind of,<br> like, not an intellect.<br> - I know you're surprised.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> Now, he's supposed<br> to match his pace to anything I do.<br> Slow, fast, anything.<br> Sit!<br> HeeI!<br> Good.<br> I think he's got the hang of it.<br> Now you.<br> Yank that leash!<br> He knows what he's supposed to do.<br> Good. Don't forget to cluck. Every<br> little minute you have to praise him.<br> Pick up that slack!<br> Cluck!<br> This is a bit more difficult<br> with crutches.<br> I once taught a man who had no legs<br> and only one arm.<br> - And he had a Great Dane.<br> - Really?<br> You're not in such bad shape.<br> I have to get going.<br> That'll be $5, please.<br> Plus the 4 cents<br> you owe me from yesterday.<br> Next time I'll stay longer and talk.<br> That's a promise.<br> It is an unfortunate fact that even<br> the most conscientious traveller...<br> ...cannot be prepared<br> for every encounter.<br> At such times,<br> one must remain calm...<br> ...and rely upon one's<br> innate common sense.<br> - Hello, Rose.<br> - Hello, Julian.<br> Come in.<br> I've brought some materials<br> for Macon.<br> - Do I hear that dog?<br> - Yes, he's in the back yard.<br> Hello, Julian.<br> Hi, guys.<br> - Hope I'm not interfering with supper.<br> - No, no.<br> - We're finished.<br> - Really?<br> What time do you eat, anyhow?<br> We haven't had our coffee.<br> Wouldn't you like some coffee?<br> I'd love some.<br> Well, that seems a little silly,<br> if you haven't eaten.<br> For me, home-brewed coffee's<br> a reaI treat.<br> Everybody in my apartment<br> building eats out.<br> There's nothing in their kitchens...<br> ...but a couple of cans of soda<br> and some peanuts.<br> - What kind of place is that?<br> - It's the Calvert Arms.<br> It's a singles' building.<br> Everybody's single.<br> What an interesting idea.<br> Well, not really.<br> Sometimes I wish for the<br> old-fashioned way of doing things...<br> ...with children and old people,<br> like normaI buildings.<br> Well, of course you do.<br> I'm going to get you<br> some nice, hot coffee.<br> Here you go.<br> Where's Porter?<br> We're not sure. He went to a hardware<br> store. We think he got lost.<br> - Good grief! When did this happen?<br> - A little while before supper.<br> Supper. You mean today?<br> He's running an errand<br> on Howard Street.<br> He's not lost<br> in any permanent sense.<br> He got lost on Howard Street?<br> It's a problem with this family,<br> directions.<br> - Really?<br> - Charles.<br> What?<br> Never mind.<br> I'll go help Rose.<br> Julian seems very nice.<br> He's here because he hopes<br> we'll do something eccentric.<br> I pray none of us says anything<br> unconventionaI around him.<br> What would we say?<br> We're the most<br> conventionaI people I know.<br> We bought every map<br> you can buy for Baltimore.<br> Alphabetized them, and still...<br> It's sad, really.<br> Oh, and what do you want<br> in your coffee?<br> Just black's fine.<br> Coffee, Macon?<br> No, thank you.<br> Here you go.<br> What do you do<br> for a living, Charles?<br> I make bottle caps.<br> - Bottle caps? Is that a fact.<br> - Well...<br> ...it's not half as exciting<br> as it sounds, really.<br> And, Rose, do you work?<br> Yes, I do.<br> I work at home.<br> I keep house for the boys.<br> Also, I take care of the older neighbours.<br> They need me to repair their plumbing.<br> You repair their plumbing.<br> What do you think?<br> It could be, Porter.<br> But he knows we wouldn't answer.<br> Yes, he'd surely call<br> a neighbour instead.<br> On the other hand...<br> Do you always give this much thought<br> to your phone calls?<br> Now, where exactly<br> is the Calvert Arms?<br> Edward...<br> ...stay.<br> Good dog.<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I didn't exactly plan on having a baby.<br> In fact, the baby was the reason<br> we got married.<br> Now, you watch him<br> while I walk away.<br> Pretty soon he'II lie like that<br> for three hours straight.<br> Three hours?<br> Isn't that sort of crueI?<br> I thought you promised<br> not to talk like that.<br> Right. Sorry.<br> My son's name is Alexander.<br> Did I tell you that?<br> Something went wrong, they had to do<br> a caesarean and take him out early.<br> I can't ever have any more children.<br> Alexander was so teeny,<br> he didn't even look like a human.<br> He had to stay in an incubator forever,<br> just about, and nearly died.<br> Norman, that's my ex-husband...<br> ...he went, When's it gonna<br> look like other babies?<br> Norman always called Alexander it.<br> Maybe you and Alexander<br> should get together sometime.<br> - Oh, well, I-<br> - He doesn't have enough men in his life.<br> Maybe the three of us could go<br> to a movie. You ever go to movies?<br> I...<br> ...really don't care for movies.<br> They make everything seem so close-up.<br> Bedpan.<br> - Outpatient.<br> - Anesthetic.<br> Hypodermic.<br> One hundred forty degrees?<br> Certain death.<br> What is she thinking?<br> Two quarts of stuffing,<br> I heard her say so.<br> Two quarts of teeming,<br> swarming bacteria.<br> Is this the Thanksgiving we all die?<br> Here comes the turkey.<br> Here it is.<br> Now, this is a reaI Thanksgiving.<br> I just wish my neighbours could see this.<br> There may be a little problem here.<br> The rest of the meaI is excellent.<br> We could fill up on the vegetables alone.<br> In fact, I think I'll do that.<br> What?<br> - The turkey.<br> - What?<br> Pure poison.<br> Come again?<br> We think it may have been cooked<br> at a slightly inadequate temperature.<br> It was not.<br> It's perfectly good.<br> - Mrs. Barrett!<br> - I can hear you.<br> Maybe you'd rather just<br> stick to the side dishes.<br> Well, perhaps I will.<br> I don't have much<br> of an appetite anyway.<br> Macon, how could you do this?<br> My lovely turkey. All that work.<br> I think it looks delicious.<br> Yes, but you don't know<br> about the other times.<br> Other times?<br> You don't fooI me for an instant.<br> I know why you're doing this. You wanna<br> make me look bad in front of Julian.<br> Julian?<br> You wanna drive him off.<br> You three wasted your chances<br> and now you want me to waste mine...<br> ...but I won't do it!<br> I can see what's what.<br> Love is what it's all about.<br> You wanna make me miss it.<br> Well, goodness.<br> You don't want me to stop cooking<br> for you and taking care of this house.<br> You don't want Julian<br> to fall in love with me.<br> Do what?<br> Do you think I ought<br> to go after her?<br> No.<br> That poor, dear girI.<br> I feeI just awfuI.<br> - But she seems so-<br> - She's fine.<br> She's perfectly fine.<br> - Now, who wants a baked potato?<br> - I do.<br> Me.<br> Julian, potato?<br> I'll take the turkey.<br> Actually, have you ever noticed<br> that Julian wears crew necks?<br> That doesn't mean he wouldn't<br> wear a V-neck if he had one.<br> He's younger, you know.<br> I don't know if you realize that.<br> Two years.<br> But he's got a younger style of living.<br> Singles apartments and so on.<br> He's tired of all that.<br> Don't try to spoiI this, Macon.<br> I only want to protect you.<br> It's wrong, you know,<br> what you said at Thanksgiving.<br> Love is not what it's all about.<br> There are all kinds of other issues.<br> He ate my turkey and didn't get sick.<br> Two big helpings.<br> I got this car for only $200.<br> That's because it needed work.<br> But I took it to Dominick,<br> this boy down the street.<br> I go, Dominick, here's the deaI.<br> You fix my car...<br> ...I'II let you use it three nights<br> a week and all day Sunday.<br> Wasn't that a good idea?<br> Very inventive.<br> Hi.<br> What a good boy.<br> Give him lots of praise.<br> - We'll both go in the drugstore.<br> - Is it safe?<br> Have to try it sooner or later.<br> Too pink.<br> What are you doing for dinner<br> tomorrow night?<br> For dinner?<br> Come and eat at my house.<br> Come on, it'll be fun.<br> Just for dinner.<br> You and me and Alexander.<br> Say 6:00.<br> It's 51021 st Street.<br> Know where that is?<br> Well, I don't believe I'm free then.<br> Think it over.<br> How old did you say<br> Alexander was?<br> He's 7.<br> Have you thought?<br> Have you given any thought<br> to coming to dinner?<br> Oh, I...<br> ...could come.<br> If it's only for dinner.<br> What else would it be for?<br> Here he is.<br> Hi, sweetie.<br> Alexander, this is Macon.<br> Can you say hi?<br> You're young to be at the doctor's<br> without your mother.<br> He's used to it. He's had to go often.<br> He's got allergies.<br> I see.<br> He's allergic to shellfish, milk, eggs<br> and most vegetables.<br> We think he may be allergic to air.<br> Whenever he's outside a long time,<br> any uncovered skin gets these bumps.<br> If a bee stings him<br> and he hasn't had his shots...<br> ...he could be dead in half an hour.<br> Dear Muriel...<br> ...I am very sorry...<br> ...but I won't be able to have dinner<br> with you tomorrow after all.<br> Something has come up.<br> Regretfully...<br> ...Macon.<br> I've got a double-barrelled shotgun<br> and I'm aiming it where your head is.<br> It's Macon.<br> Macon.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Last year...<br> ...I- I lost-<br> I experienced a loss.<br> I lost-<br> I lost my son.<br> He was just-<br> He went into a hamburger joint...<br> ...and then someone came...<br> ...a holdup man...<br> ...and shot him.<br> I can't go to dinner with people.<br> I can't talk to their little boys.<br> You have to stop asking me.<br> I don't want to hurt your feelings,<br> but I'm just not up to this.<br> Do you hear?<br> Every day I tell myself<br> it's time to be getting over this.<br> I know that people expect it of me.<br> But if anything, I'm getting worse.<br> The first year was like a bad dream.<br> I was clear to his door in the morning...<br> ...before I remembered<br> he wasn't there to be wakened.<br> But the second year is reaI.<br> I've stopped going to his door,<br> I've sometimes let a whole day pass by...<br> ...without thinking about him.<br> I believe Sarah thinks I could have<br> prevented what happened somehow.<br> She's so used to my arranging her life.<br> Now I'm far from everyone.<br> I don't have any friends anymore.<br> And everyone looks triviaI<br> and foolish and...<br> ...not related to me.<br> Just sleep.<br> Lie down and sleep.<br> What is it, Mom?<br> Go back to sleep, baby.<br> Everything's all right.<br> I just want to sleep.<br> Can you take this off?<br> I'm bashfuI.<br> - Hey there, Macon.<br> - Hey there, girls.<br> - Going to see MurieI?<br> - I thought I might.<br> - You brought your own dinner.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Good idea.<br> - You bet.<br> All right, Gunther!<br> Pizza man. Extra-large<br> combination, no anchovies.<br> I'm allergic to pizza.<br> What part?<br> What part are you allergic to?<br> Pepperoni? Sausage? Mushrooms?<br> We can take it off.<br> All of it.<br> - Can't be allergic to all of it.<br> - Well, I am.<br> You didn't ask what happened with<br> his eye doctor. I was so worried about it.<br> Sometimes you'd think<br> Alexander wasn't your grandson.<br> Ma, I'm going now. Macon's here.<br> See?<br> I shut the valve off.<br> What did I do that for?<br> I'm not so sure about this.<br> He's not very strong.<br> Why did I shut off the valve, Alexander?<br> - Why?<br> - You tell me.<br> - You tell me.<br> - No, you.<br> - So the water won't whoosh all over?<br> - Right.<br> Now, first you<br> unscrew the top screw.<br> - Let's see you do it.<br> - Me?<br> - I don't want to.<br> - Just let him watch.<br> Then he won't know how<br> to fix the one in the bathtub...<br> ...and I'm going to ask him<br> to manage that without me.<br> That's it. Hard!<br> Good.<br> Good. Good.<br> Look at that.<br> WonderfuI!<br> I think you may have naturaI talents.<br> Now, take off the faucet head...<br> ...and there is the culprit.<br> That has to be re-taped.<br> Then we take this wrench<br> to tighten this up.<br> - Now what?<br> - Go ahead and turn that valve.<br> There we go.<br> - Now what?<br> - Now we turn the water back on...<br> ...and see what<br> kind of job you've done.<br> Look at that!<br> You've solved the problem.<br> Now, when you're grown,<br> you can fix the faucets for your wife.<br> Step back, dearie, you can say.<br> Just let me see to this.<br> Let a reaI man take care of this.<br> Good. Really excellent materiaI.<br> I'd like to show you something, Macon.<br> Your sister's Christmas present.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's an engagement ring, Macon.<br> - Engagement?<br> - I wanna marry her.<br> - You want to marry Rose?<br> - I'm gonna ask her at Christmas...<br> ...when I give her the ring.<br> I wanna do this properly.<br> Old-fashioned.<br> - You think she'll have me?<br> - Well, I really couldn't say.<br> Well, she's got to. I'm 36 years old,<br> Macon, but I tell you...<br> ...I feeI like I'm a schoolboy<br> around that woman.<br> You may laugh at this,<br> but I love the surprise of her.<br> And I'm surprised by myself<br> when I'm with her.<br> I'm not exactly the person<br> that I thought I was.<br> I'm afraid I'm gushing.<br> Want to know something?<br> I've never even slept with her.<br> Well, I don't care to hear about that.<br> I want us to have a reaI wedding night.<br> I want to do everything right. God...<br> ...Macon, isn't it amazing how two<br> separate lives can link up together?<br> I mean, two differentnesses.<br> - What I really like is T-shirts.<br> - T-shirts.<br> The kind with a sort of<br> stretched-out neck.<br> I don't want it new.<br> Tell you what.<br> Everything we buy...<br> ...we'll wash about 20 times<br> before you wear it.<br> - But nothing prewashed.<br> - No, no.<br> Only nerds wear prewashed.<br> Right.<br> - Shall I come with you?<br> - I can do it myself.<br> All right.<br> - Macon!<br> - Yes.<br> Laura Canfield.<br> Scott's mother, remember?<br> Of course.<br> Why, Scott.<br> - Hi.<br> - It's nice to see you.<br> - Yeah, me too.<br> - It's nice to see you.<br> - Are you doing your spring shopping?<br> - Oh, I...<br> I'm helping the son of a friend.<br> We're buying the sock department. Every<br> other week Scott runs through his socks.<br> You know how they are at this age.<br> Or rather-<br> Yes, it's amazing, isn't it?<br> I look great!<br> I think it's time we had a talk.<br> About what?<br> I'd like to know what you think<br> you're up to with this MurieI person.<br> Is that what you call her,<br> this MurieI person?<br> You're not yourself these days, Macon...<br> ...and this MurieI person<br> is just a symptom. Everybody says so.<br> Who is everybody, anyway?<br> We're just worried for you, Macon.<br> Could we switch to some other topic?<br> - I had to tell you what I thought.<br> - Fine. You've told me.<br> Can you tell me<br> one unique thing about her?<br> I mean, one really<br> speciaI quality, Macon...<br> ...not something sloppy like<br> she appreciates me?<br> I'm not such a bargain myself,<br> if you haven't noticed.<br> Somebody ought to<br> warn her away from me.<br> That's not true. That's not true at all.<br> I imagine her people<br> are congratulating her on her catch.<br> - Her catch.<br> - Well, someone to support her. Anyone.<br> She'd be lucky to find anyone.<br> She lives in that slummy house,<br> her boy looks like he has hookworm-<br> Porter, just shut the hell up.<br> Hey, you guys, let me catch up!<br> Creep.<br> Wait up for me!<br> - Hey, guys!<br> - Get lost, Pritchett!<br> - We don't need you around here.<br> - Come on, let me catch up!<br> Go itch it, Pritchett!<br> You heard me. Get lost!<br> - Itch it, Pritchett. Pritchett, itch it.<br> - Go.<br> Watch out!<br> Pritchett, itch it.<br> Hiya, boy. How you doing?<br> Good boy!<br> Good dog, Edward.<br> Are you all right?<br> - What was that all about?<br> - Nothing.<br> Even the most disciplined<br> professional traveller...<br> ...may sometimes stumble across<br> that unexpected item he feels...<br> ...he simply must take home.<br> That's fine, as long as one is willing<br> to accept the inconvenience...<br> ...and awkwardness that come<br> with each additional piece of baggage.<br> I don't think Alexander's<br> getting a proper education.<br> He's okay.<br> I asked him to figure what change<br> they'd give back when we bought milk...<br> ...and he had no idea. He didn't<br> even know he'd have to subtract.<br> - He's only in second grade.<br> - You should switch to a private schooI.<br> - Private schools cost money.<br> - So I'll pay.<br> What are you saying?<br> Pardon?<br> Are you saying you're committed?<br> Well, that's not really the point.<br> Alexander's got 10 more years of schooI.<br> Will you be around for that?<br> I can't put him<br> in a private schooI...<br> ...and take him out again<br> on every passing whim of yours.<br> Just tell me this. Do you picture us<br> getting married sometime?<br> - When your divorce comes through?<br> - MurieI...<br> ...marriage is...<br> I don't know.<br> You don't, do you?<br> You don't know what you want.<br> One minute you like me,<br> the next you don't.<br> One minute you're ashamed of me, the<br> next I'm the best thing to happen to you.<br> You think you can just<br> go along like this. No plans.<br> Maybe tomorrow you'll be here,<br> maybe you won't.<br> Maybe you'll just go on back to Sarah.<br> - AII I'm saying is-<br> - AII I'm saying is...<br> ...take care what you promise my son.<br> Don't go making him promises<br> you don't intend to keep.<br> But I just want him to learn<br> how to subtract.<br> Shall I dry?<br> Just tell me this, Macon.<br> Be honest.<br> Why can't we get married in the fall?<br> You'll be separated a year then, Macon.<br> Hey, MurieI, please,<br> I'm not ready for this.<br> I don't think I ever will be.<br> I don't think marriage<br> ought to be as common as it is.<br> I really believe it ought to be<br> the exception to the rule.<br> Perfect couples could marry, maybe...<br> ...but who's a perfect couple?<br> - You and Sarah, I suppose.<br> - No, no.<br> You are so selfish.<br> You are so self-centred!<br> You have all these fancy reasons<br> for never doing a single thing I want!<br> Macon's sister, Rose, is getting married.<br> You understand that, Alexander?<br> Now, don't be nervous, honey.<br> You're it! I'm coming to get you!<br> - No, you're not!<br> - You're it!<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - What's this?<br> - Hey, look! Something for you.<br> Look out!<br> Hello, Macon.<br> - Hello, Sarah.<br> - Turned out to be a beautifuI day.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> I worried when it rained last night.<br> How've you been, Macon?<br> I've been all right.<br> How have you been?<br> Fine.<br> Well, good.<br> I know you're living with someone.<br> Yes, actually.<br> Yes, I am.<br> Rose told me when she invited me.<br> - How about you?<br> - Me?<br> - Are you living with anyone?<br> - Not really.<br> We're ready now.<br> Sarah's my matron of honour.<br> Did I happen to mention that?<br> No, you didn't.<br> Let's go.<br> Welcome, friends.<br> We are gathered here today<br> in this lovely garden...<br> ...to join Rose Anne Leary<br> and Julian Hedge...<br> ...in holy matrimony.<br> In turbulent, troubling times, a good<br> marriage can be the one safe place...<br> ...we know we can go.<br> Once we've been to that place,<br> known that peace...<br> ...we can never forget it.<br> I have to be able<br> to tell you what I want, Macon.<br> - I have to.<br> - You can.<br> But without being afraid<br> you'll go away.<br> - I can't be afraid all the time.<br> - It's all right, I'm not going away.<br> You are. You're all packed.<br> I'm going to Canada tomorrow,<br> remember? It's just my work.<br> Don't leave me, Macon.<br> Go to sleep, MurieI.<br> Sleep.<br> - Yes.<br> - Macon?<br> - Sarah.<br> - I didn't get you at a bad time, did I?<br> No. Is anything wrong?<br> No.<br> Well, actually...<br> ...my lease runs out<br> at the end of the month...<br> ...and I haven't found a new apartment.<br> Yes?<br> So I was wondering<br> if it would be all right with you...<br> ...if I moved back into our house,<br> just as a place to stay for a while.<br> But...<br> ...the house is a mess. Something<br> happened to it over the winter.<br> - Pipes burst, or something-<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> I talked to your brothers.<br> I went over to the house.<br> - Rose told me she'd been over, and she-<br> - Rose?<br> Yeah. She's back at your brothers'.<br> - She's what?<br> - She's living there for a while.<br> Really.<br> Charles and Porter weren't eating right.<br> So is Julian living alone now, or what?<br> Yes. She takes casseroles<br> over to him at the apartment.<br> So, what do you think?<br> - About what?<br> - About my using the house.<br> Well, yes. Fine. Of course.<br> Good. Oh, incidentally...<br> ...the papers came through<br> from the lawyers, about the divorce.<br> Yeah, it was kind of a shock,<br> seeing them in black and white.<br> Didn't take into account<br> the feelings of the thing. I...<br> - I guess I hadn't expected that.<br> - Yes.<br> Certainly. That seems<br> a naturaI reaction.<br> So, anyway, good luck<br> with the house, Sarah. Goodbye.<br> - How's the weather in Edmonton?<br> - It's kind of gray.<br> Here it's sunny. Sunny and humid.<br> Here the air is so dry that rain<br> disappears before it hits the ground.<br> - Really?<br> - You can see it above the plains.<br> It looks like stripes that just fade away<br> about halfway down from the sky.<br> I wish I were there<br> to watch it with you.<br> Well, I moved back into the house.<br> Mostly I just stay upstairs.<br> You wouldn't believe how lonely it is.<br> Macon, do you-?<br> What's that person's name,<br> the one you live with?<br> MurieI.<br> Do you plan on staying<br> with MurieI forever?<br> I really couldn't say.<br> Macon, come home.<br> Let's try again.<br> - I like this, Macon.<br> - Me too, sweetheart.<br> You know what I missed most when<br> we were separated? Little things.<br> The Saturday errands. Even the<br> things that used to bother me...<br> ...like your taking forever<br> in a hardware store.<br> Macon, I think when people<br> have been married as long as we have...<br> ...maybe it's just meant to be.<br> Anything different<br> just doesn't feeI right.<br> Rose, why haven't you<br> moved back with Julian?<br> Sarah, you wouldn't believe the state<br> the boys were in when I came back here.<br> They were living in their pyjamas<br> to avoid doing laundry.<br> - They were eating gorp for supper.<br> - I won't even ask what gorp is.<br> It's a mixture of wheat germ<br> and nuts and dried fruit.<br> What about your apartment?<br> What about Julian?<br> You know, I kept losing that apartment<br> every time I turned around.<br> I would head east to the grocery<br> store and turn west to get back again...<br> ...and I would always be wrong.<br> Always.<br> I mean, the apartment building<br> would've worked to the north somehow.<br> Macon, are you really doing this?<br> You mean to tell me you can just<br> use a person up and move on?<br> You think I'm some kind of bottle<br> of something you don't need anymore?<br> Is that the way you see me, Macon?<br> Thought I'd bring you<br> the materials for Paris.<br> Yeah, it just arrived this morning.<br> Do you think that Rose<br> is not coming back?<br> She's worried about the boys.<br> They're eating glop or something.<br> Those aren't boys, Macon,<br> they're men in their 40s.<br> - I'm afraid that she's left me.<br> - No, no, you can't be sure of that.<br> And not even for any reason.<br> Our marriage was working out fine...<br> ...but she wore herself a groove<br> in that house and she can't help...<br> ...but swerve back into it.<br> At least, I can't think of<br> any other explanation.<br> Well, that sounds about right.<br> Why don't you give her a job, Julian?<br> - A job?<br> - Yeah. Show her that office of yours.<br> That filing system<br> you never get sorted...<br> ...the secretary chewing her gum<br> and forgetting appointments.<br> Don't you think Rose<br> could take all that in hand?<br> - Well, sure, but-<br> - Call her up.<br> Tell her your business is going<br> to pieces. Ask her to come in...<br> ...and get things organized.<br> Get things under controI.<br> Put it that way.<br> Use those words.<br> Get things under controI, tell her.<br> Then sit back and wait.<br> Of course, what do I know?<br> No, you're right.<br> You're absolutely right.<br> What do you think of<br> the sofa bed?<br> It's okay. It's good.<br> How about the fabric?<br> Seems very nice.<br> Honestly, Macon, what's come over you?<br> You used to be downright finicky.<br> Well, it's...<br> ...fine, Sarah. It looks very nice.<br> Let's make it up.<br> Why don't we give the bed a triaI run?<br> - TriaI run?<br> - Yeah.<br> Macon?<br> You've never asked if I slept with<br> anyone while we were separated.<br> Don't you want to know?<br> No.<br> - I think you'd wonder.<br> - Well, I don't.<br> Macon, the trouble with you is-<br> Sarah? Look, don't even start.<br> By God, if that doesn't<br> sum up everything...<br> ...that's wrong with being married.<br> Macon, the trouble<br> with you is...<br> ...I know you better than you<br> know yourself, Macon.<br> The trouble with you is,<br> you don't believe in people opening up.<br> You think everyone should stay<br> in their own little sealed package.<br> Okay. Let's say that that's true.<br> Let's say for now that you do know what<br> the trouble with me is, that nothing...<br> ...that I might feeI<br> could surprise you.<br> And that the reason I don't want to hear<br> about this thing is that I can't open up!<br> If we agree on all that,<br> can we drop it?!<br> Flight 615, service from<br> Baltimore to Paris.<br> If you need help<br> with your luggage...<br> ...the flight attendants<br> will be happy to assist you.<br> MurieI.<br> I'm going to France.<br> But you can't!<br> Excuse me. Can I get by?<br> - MurieI, what in-?<br> - You don't own this plane.<br> - You don't own Paris, either.<br> - I don't understand this.<br> How could you afford the fare?<br> I borrowed.<br> But the point is, why, MurieI?<br> Why are you doing this?<br> You need to have me around.<br> What?<br> You were falling to pieces<br> before you had me.<br> Your room is bigger than mine is.<br> I have a better view, though.<br> Just think. We're really in Paris.<br> The bus driver said it might rain,<br> but I said I didn't care.<br> - Rain or shine, it's Paris.<br> - How did you know which bus to take?<br> I brought along your guidebook.<br> - Wanna go for breakfast?<br> - No, I don't. I can't.<br> You better leave, MurieI.<br> Okay.<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Oh, for crying out loud.<br> Hello?<br> Sarah?<br> Macon, where are you?<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing's the matter,<br> I just felt like talking to you.<br> What time is it?<br> I know it's early.<br> I'm sorry I woke you.<br> I wanted to hear your voice.<br> There's some kind<br> of static on the line.<br> Will you be gardening today?<br> What?<br> Gardening?<br> It depends on whether it's sunny.<br> I wish I were there.<br> I could help you.<br> Macon, you hate gardening.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yes, I'm fine.<br> Well, how was the flight over?<br> Oh, the flight.<br> Goodness...<br> I guess I was so busy reading<br> I didn't really notice.<br> Maybe you have jet lag.<br> Yes, maybe I do.<br> Don't fall for prix fixe.<br> It's like a mother saying, Eat, eat.<br> All those courses forced on you.<br> - Look! See what all I bought!<br> - MurieI...<br> ...have you lost your senses?<br> What must this have cost?<br> Nothing, or next to nothing.<br> I found a place that's, like,<br> the granddaddy of garage sales.<br> You say something's too expensive...<br> ...they lower the price<br> till it's cheap enough.<br> I saw this leather coat I would've killed<br> for, but the man wanted 90 francs.<br> Ninety francs is $ 15 or so.<br> Really? I thought francs and dollars<br> were about the same.<br> No.<br> Well, then these things<br> were super bargains.<br> I'll take this to my room<br> so we can go eat.<br> No, I can't.<br> Macon, what harm would it do<br> to have supper with me?<br> I'm someone from home<br> you've run into in Paris.<br> Can't we have a bite together?<br> CarefuI, those aren't<br> the Whoppers you're used to.<br> You'll wanna scrape off<br> the extra pickle and onion.<br> Who's looking after Alexander?<br> Different people.<br> What different people?<br> I hope you haven't just parked him.<br> Relax, he's fine.<br> Claire has him in the daytime and then<br> Bernice comes in and cooks supper.<br> And any time Claire has a date with<br> the generaI, the twins will take him.<br> Or...<br> ...if the twins can't, the generaI says<br> he's welcome to go with...<br> ...him and Claire to the movies.<br> Long as it's not, like,<br> too adult of a movie.<br> - Macon?<br> - Yes, MurieI?<br> - What are you doing tomorrow?<br> - Tomorrow...<br> ...I'm going out of Paris altogether.<br> Tomorrow I start on the other cities.<br> You're going without me?<br> This is high-speed travel,<br> MurieI, not fun.<br> I'm waking up at crack of dawn.<br> Take me anyway.<br> You don't have to decide right now.<br> You can think about it tonight<br> and tell me if I can go tomorrow.<br> Good night, MurieI.<br> MurieI Pritchett.<br> No.<br> Macon?<br> Macon?<br> Darn it.<br> Why did you go without me?<br> Macon, when are you gonna change?<br> Businessman's Press.<br> This is Macon Leary.<br> To whom am I speaking?<br> Oh, Macon!<br> Rose?<br> - Yes, it's me.<br> - What are you doing there?<br> I work here now.<br> I'm putting things in order.<br> You wouldn't believe this place.<br> Rose, my back has gone out on me.<br> Oh, no. Of all times.<br> Are you still in Paris?<br> Yes. So I was wondering-<br> Don't you worry.<br> I'll take care of everything.<br> Have you seen a doctor?<br> Doctors don't help, just bed rest.<br> Well, rest, then, Macon.<br> Sarah.<br> Hello, Macon.<br> Everything's taken care of.<br> I'll make your day trips for you.<br> We've rescheduled the other cities.<br> I start on them the day after tomorrow.<br> How did you get here so soon?<br> Rose. She's a wizard.<br> She's revamped that entire office.<br> You would not believe it.<br> Merci.<br> - I have a pill from Dr. Levitt.<br> - I don't take pills.<br> This time you do.<br> You're gonna get all<br> the sleep you can...<br> ...so that your back<br> has a chance to heaI.<br> Swallow.<br> Hi.<br> - How do you feeI?<br> - Okay.<br> Here's your next pill.<br> Those things are deadly.<br> They really knock me out.<br> Open.<br> Macon?<br> I saw that woman friend of yours.<br> She saw me too.<br> She seemed very surprised.<br> Sarah, this is not the way it looks.<br> How is it? I'd like to hear.<br> She came over here on her own.<br> I didn't even know it till<br> just before the plane took off.<br> She followed me, I swear it. I told her.<br> I didn't want her along.<br> I told her it was no use.<br> You didn't know till just<br> before you took off?<br> I swear it.<br> Do you believe me?<br> Yes.<br> I believe you.<br> Look who's up.<br> I brought you a snack,<br> some fresh fruit and things.<br> That's very nice of you, Sarah.<br> I was thinking, after I finish these trips,<br> if your back's feeling better...<br> ...maybe we could go sightseeing.<br> - Fine.<br> - Second honeymoon, sort of.<br> We can change your tickets<br> to a later date.<br> Your reservation's for tomorrow.<br> I don't think you can manage that.<br> - Did I tell you about Julian?<br> - No, what?<br> He moved in with Rose<br> and your brothers.<br> - What?<br> - He's living there.<br> He plays Vaccination<br> every night after supper.<br> I'll be damned.<br> Apple cider.<br> Here you are.<br> To a second honeymoon.<br> - Second honeymoon.<br> - Eighteen more years.<br> - Eighteen.<br> - Or would you say 17?<br> No. It's 18, all right.<br> We sort of skipped this past year.<br> - It can still be 18.<br> - You think so?<br> I consider this last year<br> just another stage in our marriage.<br> Don't worry. It's 18.<br> Just tell me one thing, Macon.<br> Was the little boy the attraction?<br> The fact she had a child.<br> Is that what attracted you?<br> Sarah, I swear to you, I had no idea<br> she was planning to follow me over here.<br> Oh, no, I realize that. I was just...<br> - ...wondering about the child question.<br> - What child question?<br> Yeah. Remember when you said...<br> ...that we could have another baby?<br> Oh, well, that was-<br> I don't know what that was.<br> I was thinking maybe you were right.<br> What? No. Lord.<br> Sarah, it was a terrible idea.<br> So the little boy wasn't the reason.<br> What are we talking about here?<br> Can't you just answer me?<br> I'd like to understand.<br> It's over! Can't we close the lid on it?<br> I don't cross-examine you.<br> Nobody's following me to Paris!<br> Would I blame you if someone got<br> on a plane without you knowing?<br> Before it left the ground?<br> Pardon? What-? Sarah!<br> Before it left, you saw her.<br> You could have said,<br> No. Stop this. Get off...<br> ...I never want to see you again.<br> You think I own the airline, Sarah?<br> You could have stopped her if you<br> wanted. You could have taken steps.<br> For once!<br> Sarah?<br> Sarah, I'm going back to MurieI.<br> I knew what you were going to say.<br> I'm sorry, Sarah.<br> I tried, but I can't make this work.<br> You were right about me,<br> I haven't taken steps very often.<br> But maybe it's not too late<br> for me to start.<br> I thought this might happen.<br> I don't know why it's<br> no good for us anymore.<br> I'm beginning to think it's not<br> just how much you love someone.<br> Maybe what matters is...<br> ...who you are when you're with them.<br> Was it a mistake to try again?<br> No. It's wrong to think<br> we can plan everything.<br> As though it were a business trip.<br> I don't believe that anymore.<br> Things just happen.<br> I don't regret a minute<br> I've spent with you, Sarah.<br> When I saw you...<br> ...at Rose's wedding...<br> ...I knew that somehow<br> you'd recovered, that you'd...<br> ...gone on with your life after Ethan.<br> Well, I'd tried, but I couldn't<br> do it on my own.<br> This woman...<br> ...this odd woman...<br> ...helped me.<br> She's given me another chance<br> to decide who I am.<br> To step out of the Leary groove...<br> ...and stay out.<br> You don't need me anymore.<br> We both know that.<br> But I need her.<br> Charles de Gaulle Airport, s 'il vous plait.<br> Stop...<br> for that woman.<br>
