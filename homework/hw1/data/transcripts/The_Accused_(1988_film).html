You have a good time, OK?<br> How's Sadie doin'?<br> She's fine.<br> I just got her a new flea collar.<br> Will I talk to you soon?<br> Yeah. Real soon.<br> - It's kinda expensive to call, so...<br> - OK.<br> I've gotta get up in two hours.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> - You go back to sleep, Ma.<br> - You take care.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> It's the one in the green sweater.<br> Back up, boys.<br> County Sheriff. Your name Bob?<br> Put your hands on the car over there.<br> You're under arrest.<br> - For what?<br> - Put your hands on the car.<br> You have the right to remain silent.<br> If you give up this right,<br> anything you say can be used<br> against you in a court of law.<br> - You have the right to an attorney.<br> - Paul, call my dad.<br> If you cannot afford an attorney,<br> the court will appoint one.<br> You have the right<br> to make one phone call.<br> Do you understand your rights?<br> - Yes.<br> - Fine. Join us, please.<br> - We will indict for first-degree felony.<br> - My client has no prior record.<br> There's a genuine risk of<br> the defendants fleeing the jurisdiction.<br> - I'd like him released to his family.<br> - This is a crime of extreme violence.<br> The victim has concern for her safety...<br> Miss.<br> - I ordered this well done. It's raw.<br> - Sorry. I'll have it for you in a minute.<br> - And I asked for some ketchup.<br> - Right. I'm goin' a little senile today.<br> ...accused of raping a woman at a bar<br> were released on 10,000 dollars bail.<br> Lawyers for the accused men<br> expressed confidence<br> that the facts of the case will reveal<br> that the woman was not actually raped.<br> Our defence is simple:<br> There was no rape.<br> The so-called victim<br> consented enthusiastically to the acts.<br> She put on a show, pure and simple.<br> The debate between the five candidates<br> after the council seat of Daniel Stein<br> now appears to be on again.<br> Representatives for the candidates met<br> for four hours behind closed doors...<br> Bye.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Kathryn Murphy.<br> - Why'd you let 'em out on bail?<br> - I didn't. It's standard procedure.<br> Until the jury finds you guilty,<br> you're free if you can post bail.<br> The guy on the TV<br> made it sound like I did a live sex show.<br> That's not the last time<br> that's gonna happen.<br> May I come in?<br> Yeah. Come on in.<br> Sadie, shut up.<br> The bartender at The Dugout<br> said you were sick.<br> You went lookin' for me?<br> Well, I had to go to the doctor<br> and nobody at work knows.<br> Come on, Sadie.<br> You want a seat?<br> Would you like something to drink?<br> I could really use a drink.<br> Thank you, no.<br> Just to smooth out the edges a little bit.<br> You know?<br> Listen, what time were you born?<br> I already told you<br> I didn't believe in astrology.<br> So what? I do.<br> - What time?<br> - At night. Seven. August 9th.<br> - Where?<br> - Portland.<br> Do you always drink<br> to smooth out the edges?<br> No. Sometimes I'll take<br> a hit of pot or something.<br> Why? You want some?<br> Did you have anything to drink<br> before you went to The Mill? Or smoke?<br> Half a joint, a couple of beers.<br> You know. Nothin' heavy.<br> And while you were there?<br> I don't know. I mean, I wasn't<br> falling-down drunk or anything.<br> - How were you dressed?<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> It means<br> were you dressed provocatively?<br> Showing cleavage?<br> See-through blouse?<br> What the fuck does it matter?<br> They tore it off of me.<br> Did how you dressed make those guys<br> think they could have sex with you?<br> - Did you put on a show?<br> - What the hell are you talkin' about?<br> You saw me at the hospital. You think<br> I asked for that? Is that what you think?<br> Then you get the fuck outta my house.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> that you had a record?<br> Fuck you.<br> I ain't got no record.<br> You wanna tell me about it?<br> All right. Look.<br> I was helpin' my girlfriend move<br> with a U-Haul.<br> Goin' through Jersey we ran into a cop<br> and he sees we got a busted taillight.<br> He pulls us over, he starts<br> lookin' through her desk in the back<br> and finds half a gram of coke.<br> It was nothin' big.<br> - It was her desk, not mine. Her stuff.<br> - So why is it still on the books?<br> I don't know. You tell me.<br> My record was definitely...<br> - Expunged?<br> - Yeah, expunged.<br> Have you ever made love<br> to more than one man at a time?<br> What the fuck kinda question is that?<br> The kind you're gonna be asked<br> on the stand.<br> You'll be asked if Larry or any other<br> man ever hit you and if you liked it.<br> You'll be asked about your drug bust<br> and how many drinks a day you have,<br> and how many joints,<br> and how often you go to bars alone,<br> and whether you wear underwear,<br> and how many abortions you've had.<br> And I will object to all those questions.<br> And sometimes<br> the judge will sustain me.<br> But sometimes not.<br> That ain't fair.<br> Sarah, you're a witness. The defence's<br> job is to show you're a rotten witness<br> because you've got a rotten character.<br> I got a rotten character?<br> You won't defend me<br> because I'm some low-class bimbo?<br> I didn't say that.<br> - Will those bastards go to jail?<br> - Is that what you want?<br> I want those motherfuckers<br> put away for ever.<br> Sarah said you were here that night.<br> Yeah, I was here.<br> But I didn't see what happened.<br> But if Sarah says she was raped,<br> she was raped.<br> Can you identify<br> the men who assaulted her?<br> No, I was out there.<br> Anyway, a bunch of guys were blockin'<br> the door, so I really couldn't see.<br> It was the end of my shift,<br> so I left while she was still in here.<br> - Do you know any of these guys?<br> - No.<br> There was a bunch of 'em that were<br> real rowdy. You know. Yellin', clappin'.<br> I really just thought she was partyin'.<br> You know?<br> - Is there anyone you can identify?<br> - Like how?<br> Did you notice anything different<br> about any of them?<br> Let's say long hair?<br> Beard? Moustache?<br> Birthmark? Bandanna?<br> Jewellery?<br> Scar? Tattoo?<br> Tattoo. Yeah.<br> Can you describe it?<br> A scorpion. One guy had a scorpion.<br> How many drinks<br> would you say she'd had?<br> I don't know. She was pretty loaded.<br> She'd just had this big fight with Larry -<br> the guy she lives with.<br> She just needed to cool out a little.<br> What do you know about Larry?<br> Not much. Except he's an asshole.<br> He says he's a musician<br> but he's just a dealer.<br> He rides a motorcycle.<br> Come on, man. Gimme a break.<br> These guys are my bread and butter.<br> You sure you didn't see anyone else?<br> Some kid I never seen before played<br> one of the video machines all night.<br> - Who was with him?<br> - Nobody I saw.<br> Jesse, I'm gonna phone<br> the state liquor authority<br> and tell 'em how you kept servin' booze<br> while a violent felony was<br> committed in your back room.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yes. Thanks, Jesse. We'll talk.<br> I need these by 11. See you tomorrow.<br> Is he free?<br> - Game time. Let's go.<br> - I know. Just a second.<br> I really don't believe this.<br> - Tina, where the hell are the tickets?<br> - You gave 'em to me to hold.<br> - How are you doing on Tobias?<br> - We'll talk about it at the game.<br> Tina, if Charley calls,<br> I'll be home after 11.<br> Ref, cross-checking!<br> Open your eyes, will ya?<br> Take him out, Donovan!<br> - Play hockey.<br> - Did you see that?<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks.<br> If I take it to trial, they'll destroy her.<br> She walked in alone, she got drunk,<br> she got stoned, she came on to them.<br> - She's got a prior for possession.<br> - That's inadmissible.<br> Sure, but they'll ask her about it.<br> I'll object, the judge'll sustain it,<br> but the jury'll hear it.<br> I read her Q and A.<br> Gang-raped on a pinball machine.<br> - It's an ugly case.<br> - But is it a winnable case?<br> Kathryn, we understand<br> that you love to win.<br> But I can't let you dismiss this<br> because you don't have a lock.<br> A lock? I don't have a case.<br> Her girlfriend didn't see anything,<br> the bartender didn't.<br> The others either didn't see anything<br> or didn't think it was anything special.<br> I got Polito, but once the defence<br> brings up that he's on probation,<br> they'll know that we squeezed him.<br> What about the guy who called,<br> who reported it?<br> We have his voice on tape, but we don't<br> know who he is or where to find him.<br> Kathryn, do you believe<br> she was raped?<br> Yes. But I can't win it.<br> And they can't walk.<br> So make a deal and you put 'em away.<br> - A deal with what?<br> - You got enough. Go for rape two.<br> Any felony, as long as it's a violent one.<br> Assault, coercion,<br> reckless endangerment, menacing...<br> - I can't do that.<br> - You said she was raped.<br> So make a deal and put 'em away.<br> I don't care if they only get six months.<br> Just make a deal and put 'em away.<br> Do you understand, Mr Polito, that<br> you'll be testifying before a grand jury?<br> Yeah, I got that.<br> And you'll be testifying<br> against people you're acquainted with?<br> Yeah.<br> Mr Polito, have I or anyone in the<br> sheriff's department or the DA's office<br> offered you any inducement to testify?<br> Money, gifts, anything?<br> - No.<br> - Thank you, Mr Polito.<br> Well, he's just a taste.<br> The bar was filled with witnesses.<br> We anticipate that they'll all<br> testify for The People.<br> Anticipate? A hundred says<br> you'll have to drag 'em into court.<br> And they'll be useless<br> cos they were too drunk.<br> Whatever you say.<br> Keep in mind that we don't need<br> corroboration to prove rape.<br> And we do have medical evidence:<br> No doubt about penetration.<br> And physical evidence:<br> No doubt about force.<br> - What will you take?<br> - Rape one.<br> We were thinking more<br> in the line of sexual abuse two.<br> Rape one. Maybe I could convince the<br> judge not to give them the maximum.<br> I'd rather go to trial.<br> Fine.<br> By the way, no separate deals.<br> One goes to trial, all go to trial.<br> What would you say to<br> sexual abuse one?<br> - I'd say rape one.<br> - Cut the crap. Polito looks like shit.<br> You don't have anybody better.<br> And your complaining witness?<br> She walked into a bar,<br> got loaded and stoned,<br> and did everything but yank their dicks.<br> No jury'll buy her.<br> What would you say to rape two,<br> with a recommendation for one year?<br> I'd say go to hell.<br> Miss Murphy, are you sure you're<br> in a position to be quite so adamant?<br> - A rape trial...<br> - Is always a gamble. I agree, Mr Henley.<br> And I know your reputation.<br> But look at these photographs.<br> This is what the jury is going to see.<br> And they'll see the girl, too.<br> You can't tell from these, but she's tiny.<br> The most defenceless-looking thing<br> you ever saw.<br> If we go to trial and you lose, I'm gonna<br> ask for 15 to 25 - and I'll get it.<br> - 18 months.<br> - Stop dancing.<br> What's your best offer?<br> Two to five, rape two.<br> With luck,<br> your boys will be out in nine months.<br> On one condition.<br> I'll accept that on behalf of my client<br> if the formal charge is changed<br> to one without a sexual element.<br> He's a kid of 22.<br> He's an A student. He's got a future.<br> I can't do that.<br> He won't plead guilty<br> to a sexual offence.<br> Assault?<br> Coercion?<br> Reckless endangerment?<br> - Malicious...<br> - Reckless endangerment?<br> Three men accused of raping<br> a young woman in a local bar<br> pleaded guilty to a reduced charge<br> of reckless endangerment.<br> They were sentenced<br> to two-and-a-half to five years in prison.<br> Neither the district attorney's office<br> nor the defence<br> would comment on the plea bargain.<br> No explanation was given<br> for reducing the charges<br> from rape to reckless endangerment.<br> A source close to the defence hinted<br> that the alleged victim would not have<br> made a strong witness for the state.<br> - Where do you want these?<br> - There.<br> I think this looks raw.<br> - Shit.<br> - I'll get it.<br> Here we go. Now, this is an experiment,<br> so I want you all to be kind, OK?<br> Excuse me.<br> You double-crossing bitch.<br> You sold me out. Did you see this?<br> - Is this what you did?<br> - Excuse us.<br> Yeah, I wouldn't make a good witness.<br> I'm too fragile. My past is questionable.<br> I'm a drunk,<br> I'm a pothead, a drug addict,<br> a slut that got bounced<br> around a little in a bar?<br> - So I didn't get raped?<br> - Of course you were raped.<br> How come it doesn't say<br> "Sarah Tobias was raped"?<br> What the fuck is<br> reckless endangerment?<br> A felony that carries<br> the same prison term as rape.<br> You asked me to put them away,<br> and that's what I did.<br> Who the hell are you to decide that<br> I ain't good enough to be a witness?<br> I bet you if I went to law school<br> and I didn't live in some dump...<br> I understand how you feel.<br> I did my best.<br> You don't understand how I feel.<br> I'm standin' there with my pants down<br> and my crotch out for the world to see<br> and three guys are stickin' it to me<br> and other guys are yelling and clapping<br> and you're standing there telling me<br> that that's the best you can do.<br> If that's the best you can do,<br> then your best sucks.<br> I don't know what you got for sellin' me<br> out, but I sure as shit hope it's worth it.<br> Wow. What did you do?<br> - That looks weird.<br> - I needed a change.<br> It's nothin' heavy. It's just...<br> I'm not used to it.<br> Stop. All right?<br> When are you gonna get over this?<br> You're gonna have to snap out of this<br> pretty soon cos it's gettin' boring.<br> Get outta here.<br> Fine.<br> - Be back in a couple of hours.<br> - No.<br> You get the fuck out<br> and don't come back.<br> Shit. You can cut your fuckin' hair<br> any way you want.<br> This is my house<br> and I don't want you in it. Now get out.<br> Fine. I'm gone.<br> You caught me. I'm sorry. This is gonna<br> sound like the worst kinda crap,<br> - but I seen you before.<br> - You're right. It's the worst kinda crap.<br> I have seen you. You're a friend<br> of Johnny Alworth's sister.<br> No.<br> It was Duck Island.<br> Last Sunday afternoon, softball game?<br> - Your hair was different.<br> - No.<br> Yes. It was long.<br> Look, I live with somebody.<br> OK? All right?<br> I got it. I'm sorry.<br> He's a lucky guy.<br> You sure you don't wanna<br> go out tonight?<br> I got a smile. Well, it's a start.<br> - Sexy Sadie, what about it?<br> - I told you, I live with somebody.<br> - I don't mind. I'm liberated.<br> - Well, I do. I mind.<br> - Cos I do know you, Sexy Sadie.<br> - You mixed me up with somebody else.<br> Nope. You're the girl<br> from The Mill that night.<br> I remember Sexy Sadie. I do know you.<br> Am I right?<br> Hey, Sexy Sadie.<br> I know you. Do I remember you!<br> Hey, lover lady.<br> Wanna play pinball?<br> I pay my bills. I'm sick and tired of this.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> - I'm sorry...<br> - Come on.<br> I'm sorry about this.<br> But I do know that I made the payment.<br> There's an insurance company that<br> I made the payment to. My husband...<br> - Come on, babe.<br> - OK. I'll phone them. Thanks.<br> You can go in now. Keep it short.<br> Thanks.<br> Sarah?<br> What happened?<br> "Wanna play pinball?"<br> What?<br> That's what he said.<br> "You wanna play pinball?"<br> He sees I'm a piece of shit.<br> Everybody figures I'm a piece of shit.<br> Why not?<br> You told 'em that.<br> I never got to tell nobody nothin'.<br> You did all my talkin' for me.<br> I don't get it.<br> I thought you were on my side.<br> You told me you were on my side.<br> Why did you do that?<br> Sorry, Officer. It's one of those days.<br> My insurance is no good here.<br> I pay all my bills.<br> What happens? Nothing.<br> I'm sorry, OK?<br> - How's your head?<br> - Just great.<br> Honey, just wait here.<br> I'll go get the car.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> I'm sorry to bother you.<br> What exactly happened?<br> Exactly? She rammed my truck.<br> I was minding my own business. She<br> drove her car into my truck. All right?<br> - Do you know why?<br> - How do I know why? She's nuts.<br> - Do you know her?<br> - No, I don't know her.<br> She's a whore. Last time I saw her,<br> she was doin' a sex show.<br> - Come on.<br> - You watched?<br> - You bet. She put on a great show.<br> - I thought she was raped.<br> Raped? She fucked a bar full of guys,<br> then she blames them for it?<br> She loved it. She had an audience.<br> She did the show of her life.<br> Come on, move over.<br> Next time she does another show,<br> tell her I'll be right there to cheer her on.<br> I'd like to report a girl's in trouble.<br> - May I have your name?<br> - Listen, a girl's in trouble.<br> - It's The Mill, the bar on Mill Road.<br> - Sir, I must...<br> She may be hurt. An assault's going on.<br> It's a rape. There's three or four guys.<br> I don't know. There's a whole crowd...<br> - There's a whole crowd.<br> - Can I get your name, please?<br> "...or otherwise attempts to persuade<br> another person to commit a felony."<br> Please.<br> I know about criminal solicitation.<br> But in this case it simply doesn't apply.<br> It's not the intent of the statute.<br> Listen again. "A person is guilty<br> of criminal solicitation<br> if he commands, induces, entreats<br> or otherwise attempts to persuade<br> another person to commit a felony."<br> You can read it to me<br> till you're blue in the face.<br> I am not gonna let you prosecute<br> a bunch of spectators.<br> They're not spectators.<br> They solicited the rape.<br> Do you really want to ask a jury<br> to lock up a bunch of people<br> for clapping and cheering?<br> Clapping, cheering, pushing, goading.<br> Getting the rape going<br> and keeping it going.<br> What happens if you lose?<br> You'll look like an incompetent.<br> If you win,<br> you'll look like a vengeful bitch.<br> Either way,<br> you hurt yourself and this office.<br> Now drop it.<br> You've got more important things to do.<br> No, I haven't.<br> You haven't got more important things<br> to do than go to trial with a sure loser?<br> What the hell has gotten into you?<br> - We owe her.<br> - Owe her what?<br> We put the rapists away.<br> I owe her.<br> I see. You want to spend my money<br> to put a bunch of spectators on trial -<br> a trial you'll lose -<br> because you owe her.<br> No.<br> You don't get to use this office<br> to pay your debts.<br> I am gonna try this case<br> and you're not gonna stop me.<br> Kathryn, you're an ace.<br> You've got a great future.<br> Don't put it in jeopardy.<br> What are you gonna do? Fire me?<br> Go right ahead.<br> My first case will be a civil suit<br> against the rapists, the solicitors,<br> the Bar, and the state.<br> I will show that Sarah was in hospital<br> because this office sold her out.<br> I will subpoena your records<br> and cross-examine you<br> on every sleazy plea bargain<br> this office ever made.<br> You go try your case.<br> You have a good time.<br> Because, win or lose, you're through.<br> What are you lookin' at?<br> Get back to work.<br> Sarah? I'd like to talk to you.<br> May I come in?<br> We got nothin' to talk about.<br> - Yes, we...<br> - Get outta here.<br> Who the hell do you think you are?<br> - I have to talk to you.<br> - Get out of my house.<br> Will you listen to me, please?<br> I'm listenin'.<br> Sarah, I made a mistake.<br> Before I made the deal,<br> I should have offered you the choice<br> of going to trial and testifying.<br> I can offer that to you now.<br> I've found a way for you to go into court<br> and testify that you were raped.<br> - The case is over.<br> - The rape case, sure.<br> You made sure of that, didn't you?<br> I want to prosecute the others.<br> The ones who cheered and clapped.<br> - The ones who made it happen.<br> - So you can make another deal?<br> No. I'm not gonna make any more deals.<br> If I prosecute the others, the rapists<br> will stay in jail for the full five years.<br> And the rape will go on record.<br> The deal won't matter<br> because the rape will go on record.<br> You really wanna do that?<br> Only if you help me.<br> I need you to testify.<br> I get to tell my story?<br> Yes.<br> Are you alone now?<br> Yeah. I kicked him out.<br> While I was laid up, he came back<br> to pick up all of his stuff.<br> What's his is his, what's mine is his.<br> Thank God he left me the radio.<br> Anything I can do?<br> Yeah.<br> What?<br> No deals.<br> Sally? It's Kathryn Murphy.<br> Hi.<br> Listen, I need your help again.<br> Come on, cut it out.<br> - Are these yours?<br> - Yeah.<br> Go play someplace else now, OK?<br> I thought it was all over.<br> I'm gonna prosecute<br> the ones that cheered it on.<br> You said of the guys blocking your view<br> that they were "real rowdy",<br> "yelling and clapping".<br> Not the guys at the door.<br> The ones over by the pinball machine.<br> So you knew that<br> they were yelling about Sarah?<br> Yeah, but they aren't the kind of guys<br> you really wanna mess with.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Listen, I'd like you to come in and see<br> if you could identify them in a line-up.<br> Jesus. They're gonna be<br> right there, aren't they?<br> Yes.<br> I don't know.<br> Why don't we make a date for you to<br> come in to my office and talk about it?<br> Sally, she's your friend.<br> Number two.<br> Seven.<br> You positive?<br> Yes.<br> Number four. Definitely.<br> You can go in now. It's down<br> to the end of the hall to your right.<br> There's no purpose in meeting again<br> because I'm taking them to trial.<br> Good luck to you, too.<br> Hi.<br> Thank you for coming. Sarah,<br> there was no need for you to come.<br> - I figured she could use the company.<br> - Would you mind waiting outside?<br> - Alana, could you hold my calls?<br> - I'll wait outside, then.<br> Sally, why don't you have a seat<br> right down here, OK?<br> I want to begin by asking you a few<br> questions about the night of April 18th.<br> Answer as simply and honestly<br> as possible.<br> A few. Maybe three.<br> I've seen her drink a lot more than that.<br> She needed to get loose cos she'd just<br> had this big fight with her old man.<br> And she goes "I'm so pissed at him."<br> You know?<br> Cos she's sure<br> he's runnin' around on her.<br> You mean sleeping around?<br> Right. Which I bet he is.<br> So we were sitting in a booth<br> just sort of talking...<br> There were these two<br> fraternity guys there,<br> and Sarah looks at one of 'em - Bob.<br> She goes "He's cute. Who's he?"<br> - So we started jokin' around.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You know.<br> Like, how could she get back at Larry?<br> Should she take this guy home<br> and just do it right in front of him?<br> - You said she should take Bob home...<br> - No, she said it.<br> She didn't mean it.<br> She was just jokin' around.<br> She'd had a few drinks.<br> God, she didn't mean it.<br> - I'll wait for you downstairs.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - I want to talk to you.<br> - What's goin' on?<br> - I warned you: No secrets.<br> - I didn't keep any secrets from you.<br> She told me what you said in the bar<br> when you met Bob. Do you remember?<br> - Do you?<br> - Yeah. I said...<br> "I'd like to take that guy home<br> and fuck him in front of Larry."<br> - So what? It was a joke.<br> - She can't be a witness for you.<br> In fact, when the defence finds her,<br> she'll be a witness for them.<br> Now what other surprises<br> have you got waiting for me?<br> None.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Is Jesse around?<br> - No, it's his day off.<br> - Can I get you a drink or somethin'?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Mr Joyce?<br> - Hi.<br> I'm Deputy District Attorney<br> Kathryn Murphy.<br> I'd like to talk to you about the night<br> of April 18th and the rape at The Mill.<br> - I don't know anything about it.<br> - Yes, you do, Mr Joyce.<br> - You want to talk over here?<br> - Sorry. I got a class.<br> Your class can wait. You were there.<br> Your name is on the video machine.<br> And I'm calling you as a witness.<br> Now would you like to sit down<br> and talk about it?<br> What do you want?<br> You got the ones who did it.<br> I'm prosecuting the others.<br> The ones who cheered them on.<br> - I didn't see a thing.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> You were in the room all night.<br> You saw everything.<br> Those other guys didn't do anything.<br> They probably didn't even know<br> what was going on.<br> It was like a show.<br> Big deal. They watched.<br> I bet if you asked a thousand people,<br> They did more than watch,<br> and that is a crime.<br> Wanna tell me about it?<br> Look, if you don't tell me about it now,<br> you'll have to tell me about it<br> on the witness stand.<br> Why? This isn't my business.<br> I don't care about this.<br> Yes, you do.<br> - Birchfield County Emergency.<br> - I'd like to report a girl's in trouble.<br> - May I have your name?<br> - Listen, a girl's in trouble.<br> - It's The Mill, the bar on Mill Road.<br> - Sir, I must...<br> She may be hurt. An assault's going on.<br> It's a rape. There's three or four...<br> Arriving at the courthouse now<br> is Kathryn Murphy,<br> the deputy district attorney<br> in this precedent-setting case.<br> With her is Sarah Tobias.<br> This is our first chance<br> to see the victim in person.<br> Will you put Miss Tobias on the stand?<br> - Who else will you put on the stand?<br> - No comment.<br> - Is your friend testifying against you?<br> - Son of a bitch.<br> - Did you make a deal with the defence?<br> - No comment.<br> Are you deaf, asshole? No comment.<br> You'll wait right here<br> for the officer to come and get you.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Moral support.<br> Saw Whitewood having breakfast with<br> Anderson. Seemed in a good mood.<br> Good luck, Sarah.<br> Sarah Tobias? Please come in.<br> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and<br> nothing but the truth, so help you God?<br> I do.<br> - State your name.<br> - Sarah Tobias.<br> Please be seated.<br> Miss Tobias,<br> on the night of the rape at The Mill...<br> Objection. These men<br> are not on trial for rape.<br> Your Honour,<br> it is imperative that the jury understand<br> what was happening to Miss Tobias<br> before, during and after the rape.<br> Miss Murphy, you may continue<br> your line of questioning, but be brief.<br> Thank you, Your Honour.<br> Miss Tobias, can you please tell us<br> what happened that night at The Mill?<br> Well, my boyfriend...<br> My boyfriend and I had a fight,<br> so I got in my car and I drove<br> to see my girlfriend Sally at The Mill.<br> I figured she'd be gettin' off work<br> and we could talk.<br> - She worked there?<br> - Yeah. She's a waitress, just like me.<br> So anyway, she was on a break.<br> We were sittin' in this booth, talking,<br> and this guy Danny<br> sent over a couple of drinks.<br> She knew him so we took the drinks<br> and he sat down<br> and we started talking.<br> And he was funny.<br> You know. He had a line.<br> So what happened next?<br> A bunch of guys<br> went into the back room to play pinball.<br> So me and Danny went in and<br> we started playing with this guy Bob.<br> And, after I finished my turn,<br> I went to go have a smoke.<br> You know. Smoke a little pot.<br> Somebody put some money<br> into the jukebox<br> and this song I really liked<br> came on the jukebox,<br> so I started to dance.<br> And then Danny comes up<br> and he starts dancing with me.<br> Real close.<br> You know, tight close.<br> And then he kissed me.<br> I'm sorry, Miss Tobias.<br> Could you please speak up?<br> He kissed me.<br> Did you try to stop him?<br> No. I let him kiss me, because I figured<br> he was drunk and he was stoned<br> and that he would kiss me<br> and then he would leave me alone.<br> And then he put his hand up my shirt<br> and he grabbed at my breast.<br> I tried to push him away<br> but he kept pulling me closer.<br> And he put his hand on my throat.<br> And he's a really strong guy,<br> you know.<br> And the next thing I knew...<br> Please go on, Miss Tobias.<br> He was squeezin' my throat<br> with his hand,<br> and he pushed me down<br> on the pinball machine,<br> and he ripped my shirt.<br> He lifted my skirt.<br> He pulled down my underpants,<br> really hard.<br> I wanted to move, but he was<br> holding me down really hard.<br> And he was jammin' his...<br> He was kissing me very hard and<br> he was jammin' his hand on my crotch.<br> I heard a bunch of people yellin'<br> "Hold her down."<br> Then the big guy - Kurt -<br> held my arms down.<br> I could hear 'em yelling<br> and clapping and cheering.<br> And then...<br> Danny put his hands over my mouth,<br> over my face,<br> and I shut my eyes.<br> He was inside of me.<br> And then...<br> And then they switched.<br> I could hear 'em sayin' "Frat boy".<br> Then Bob was inside of me.<br> There was all this yelling<br> and clapping and laughing.<br> Then I heard 'em call for Kurt:<br> "Needle dick".<br> Then they switched again,<br> and Kurt was inside of me.<br> They were yelling "Kurt, Kurt",<br> and there was all this chanting.<br> Please continue, Miss Tobias.<br> What did they chant?<br> Something...<br> "Poke that pussy."<br> The room was full of people<br> cheering this on?<br> Yeah, and I kicked him really hard.<br> I ran out into the road.<br> This guy picked me up<br> and took me to the hospital.<br> No further questions, Your Honour.<br> Miss Tobias,<br> my name is Ben Wainwright.<br> Now, I know this isn't easy for you,<br> so I'm going to ask you<br> only a handful of questions.<br> Now, you have testified that all the men<br> present were strangers to you.<br> You've also testified that,<br> while you were on the pinball machine,<br> that you mostly kept your eyes closed.<br> Is that right? Your eyes were closed?<br> Yes, sometimes.<br> Is it fair to say that you can't tell us<br> who applauded or who shouted?<br> Is that fair?<br> I...<br> Is it possible<br> that only one person shouted?<br> No. There were different voices.<br> So at least two, then.<br> Could it have been only two?<br> No. They overlapped.<br> Miss Tobias, you testified that you were<br> assaulted by three men. Is that right?<br> - Yes.<br> - OK.<br> Is it possible -<br> and I'm just saying possible -<br> that the only ones who shouted<br> were among your assaulters?<br> No. The voices were<br> coming from further away.<br> OK.<br> Miss Tobias,<br> you had had several drinks,<br> you had smoked marijuana,<br> the TV was playing,<br> the jukebox was playing,<br> you were in a room full of noisy<br> video games and pinball machines,<br> you had your eyes closed, sometimes,<br> and you were being assaulted.<br> Now, given these conditions,<br> can you truly say<br> how many voices you heard<br> and where those voices<br> were coming from?<br> No.<br> Is it fair to say, then,<br> that you can't tell us<br> who applauded or who shouted?<br> Is that fair?<br> Yes, that's fair.<br> OK. Thank you.<br> Miss Tobias,<br> while you were on the pinball machine,<br> did you at any time<br> cry "Help" or "Rape"?<br> No. I tried but<br> they were covering my mouth.<br> They were either kissing me or<br> they had their hands all over my mouth.<br> I kept saying "No."<br> "No"?<br> Right. I said "No."<br> Not "Rape" or "Help" or "Police",<br> but "No"?<br> Right. "No."<br> - Did anybody hear you?<br> - I don't know.<br> Did you signal to anybody<br> in the room? A hand signal?<br> No. My hands were pinned down.<br> Signal to anybody with your eyes?<br> No.<br> - Were you struggling?<br> - Yes.<br> Anybody see you struggling?<br> They must have.<br> Miss Tobias,<br> can you in any way prove to us<br> that someone in that room - anyone -<br> saw you struggling<br> or heard you say "No"?<br> No.<br> No more questions.<br> Miss Tobias, while you were being<br> gang-raped, what were you thinking?<br> - Thinking?<br> - Yes. What were you thinking?<br> What words came into your head?<br> Three men were repeatedly raping you,<br> holding you down and raping you,<br> and their friends cheered and clapped,<br> and you lay there naked, defenceless,<br> struggling, weeping and in pain.<br> What words came into your head?<br> What words?<br> "No."<br> No further questions, Your Honour.<br> The witness is excused.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - Good.<br> - Did you cut the whole day to come?<br> - It's no big deal.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - I've been better.<br> So how's everything?<br> What have I been missin'?<br> Listen.<br> They're prosecuting three other guys<br> in the bar who were cheering.<br> They're making me testify. But you have<br> absolutely nothing to worry about.<br> - I just wanted to tell you.<br> - Nothin' to worry about?<br> - Are you out of your fuckin' mind?<br> - You're not even on trial.<br> - What are you gonna say?<br> - I'm gonna tell 'em what happened.<br> And what happened?<br> Come on, man. You know.<br> A bunch of guys<br> were cheering and yelling and stuff<br> as you, Kurt and Danny...<br> well, you raped her.<br> Who said I raped her?<br> I'm not in here for rape.<br> Did you see me rape her, Ken?<br> - What do you think?<br> - You didn't, did you?<br> Yes, I did, Bob.<br> Ken, if you say that,<br> you know what happens to me?<br> - Nothing's gonna happen.<br> - No.<br> Instead of my nine months in here,<br> the parole board'll turn it into five years.<br> - They're making me do this.<br> - No.<br> All they can do is call you.<br> They can't make you say anything.<br> You don't remember. You were drunk,<br> too confused to get any of it straight.<br> I don't wanna lie, Bob.<br> Do you wanna come visit me here<br> for the next five years?<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - I hope you like it black.<br> - I do. Thanks.<br> I meant to tell you. This week,<br> Leos, they frighten away friends...<br> Not now, Sarah, please.<br> Sorry.<br> Excuse us, Miss Murphy.<br> Mr Joyce has something<br> to tell you and Miss Tobias.<br> He doesn't truly remember the events<br> of the night in question.<br> And he only told you what he told you<br> because you coerced him.<br> He says if you put him on the stand,<br> he will recant. He'll take it all back.<br> Did you have something to do<br> with this?<br> I suggest you notify the court and<br> the defence that he won't be testifying.<br> In fact, it might be less awkward<br> if you move for immediate dismissal.<br> Wait right here, one minute.<br> Why?<br> I don't remember.<br> I only told her what I told her<br> cos she forced me to.<br> And if she makes me take the stand,<br> I'm gonna recant it all, take it all back.<br> - Why?<br> - I told you. I don't remember anything.<br> You're full of shit.<br> Where do you get off tellin' me<br> I'm full of shit? I was there, remember?<br> Right. You were there<br> and you saw me have a few drinks.<br> You saw me blow some grass.<br> You saw me flirt a little bit.<br> And then you saw me gang-raped.<br> And you think that I had it comin'.<br> - You're just like all the others.<br> - My best friend is in prison.<br> If I do this,<br> they'll keep him for five years.<br> Your best friend is just some great guy<br> and I'm just this lowlife whore<br> that he raped right in front of you.<br> You're not like all the others.<br> You're worse.<br> That's not true. I'm not like that. OK?<br> Are you scared?<br> Yeah.<br> Me, too.<br> Your Honour,<br> The People call Kenneth Joyce.<br> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and<br> nothing but the truth, so help you God?<br> I do.<br> - State your name.<br> - Kenneth Joyce.<br> Be seated, please.<br> Mr Joyce, were you in The Mill the night<br> of the events involving Sarah Tobias?<br> Yes.<br> Would you please<br> recount for us what happened?<br> It was late, and me and my friend<br> Bob had been to the game.<br> Then afterwards he took me to this bar<br> he sometimes goes to, The Mill.<br> We had been there for a while when<br> this girl walked in. She was really sexy.<br> She was sitting at the table<br> behind us, talking to her friend.<br> This guy Danny was sitting at the end<br> of the bar, and he saw her come in too,<br> and he sent the bartender over<br> with some drinks.<br> So I'm washin' dishes and I hear Bonnie<br> screamin' her head off and go "Great."<br> So Chip walks out in cowboy boots and<br> goes "I didn't just kick her in the head."<br> - Hey, dude.<br> - What's goin' on?<br> - He's cute. Who's he?<br> - Bob something.<br> Some college guy.<br> I should take him home and fuck<br> his brains out right in front of Larry.<br> Yeah, right.<br> Can I watch?<br> Behind you. Blonde girl.<br> Wants me in a big way.<br> Jesse, come here.<br> Here we go, ladies. Compliments<br> of the gentleman at the end of the bar.<br> What do you think he'll do?<br> - Evening, ladies.<br> - Danny, this is my friend Sarah.<br> - Thanks for the drinks, Danny.<br> - It was my pleasure, Sarah.<br> Were you talkin' shop?<br> No, we were talking modern romances.<br> Yeah? I'm a romantic.<br> That makes me just like you, Sarah.<br> And you are one romantic-lookin' girl.<br> Woman.<br> Danny. It's your turn.<br> - Romantic?<br> - She didn't come with me.<br> You don't have to take my word for it.<br> Walk in the back and see for yourself.<br> OK.<br> This is the game room.<br> Then she got up<br> and followed him into the game room.<br> Pretty soon they were playing pinball<br> with Bob and getting really loaded.<br> - I got 100.<br> - That's a double.<br> She's on a roll. Quick reflexes there.<br> - You better shut up.<br> - I don't wanna distract you.<br> Come on, light it up. Keep goin'.<br> Hurry up now. She can score.<br> - Yeah. Go.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - You lose.<br> - No, I'm the winner. I don't lose.<br> - Check the score.<br> - Look at that.<br> - There you go, pal.<br> - Lucky shot.<br> Lucky my ass. Lucky you wish.<br> Yeah?<br> Looks like her hand's<br> connected to her ass.<br> What's your problem?<br> Who is she?<br> Get her outta here. I hate her.<br> - You're up.<br> - Maybe next time, OK?<br> Knock it off.<br> - Go for it.<br> - I'm gonna.<br> You gonna keep that all to yourself?<br> Yeah.<br> - Didn't your mom teach you manners?<br> - No.<br> - Angela, go put some music on.<br> - I don't have any change.<br> Angie, I got some change.<br> - You're so funny, I can't stand it.<br> - I know. Everybody tells me that.<br> - So modest, too.<br> - I'm very modest. Let's get outta here.<br> - Look who's gettin' bossy.<br> - I'll even let you drive.<br> - Do you know how to drive?<br> - Do you know how to walk?<br> - Let's get outta here. Come on.<br> - No. I love this song.<br> - Are you off, honey?<br> - Yeah. I don't like the show.<br> Now I hope it's gonna be me.<br> - Young lady, have you been drinking?<br> - Who, me? No, officer.<br> That's it. I'm taking you in.<br> Listen. I gotta go<br> cos I've gotta work tomorrow.<br> - I'm a workin' thing. I gotta go.<br> - OK. What do they pay you?<br> I'm too drunk, man. I gotta go home.<br> Mr Funny Man, I gotta go.<br> Come on.<br> Yo, Dan.<br> Wait a minute, will you?<br> Come on, man.<br> - Go, Danny. Fourth-and-one. Stick 'em.<br> - Right.<br> - All right.<br> - No!<br> Yeah, yeah!<br> Man, he's gonna fuck her right there.<br> All right, Danny. Good man.<br> Grab her hands, Kurt.<br> - Go on.<br> - All right, Danny!<br> Come on, Dan. Go for it, Dan.<br> Come on, big guy.<br> Smell that new blood, baby.<br> That's it, Danny. Make her come.<br> Come on. She's lovin' it.<br> College boy, you're next.<br> Come on, Dan.<br> Fuckin' pump. Yeah.<br> That's it, man. Go.<br> All right!<br> Frat boy! Frat boy!<br> Get the frat boy in there.<br> Come on, move.<br> - Go get her, frat boy.<br> - Your turn.<br> No!<br> No!<br> Pump that college ass of yours, boy.<br> That's it. Pump that fuckin' college ass.<br> - Come on. Go.<br> - Stick it to her.<br> Hold her down.<br> Is she ready to come? I can't see.<br> Hold her down.<br> Make her fuckin' moan, man.<br> - Hold her down.<br> - Make her moan.<br> Kurt, watch the young kid.<br> You might learn somethin'.<br> Shut the fuck up, asshole.<br> - Whoa, man. Listen to needle dick.<br> - Kurt, come on.<br> - Kurt, are you a faggot?<br> - You let him talk to you like that?<br> You pull down your pants,<br> we'll see silk panties?<br> Shut the fuck up.<br> Kurt! Kurt!<br> Yeah, you got the champion.<br> - Whoa, here comes Kurt.<br> - Come on. Go. Fuckin' get her.<br> Come on, Kurt. Gotta see his panties.<br> Come on, Kurt. Go ahead.<br> Come on. You're next, huh?<br> One, two, three, four,<br> poke that pussy till it's sore.<br> No!<br> Mr Joyce, do you believe<br> that Sarah Tobias instigated that rape?<br> No, I don't.<br> Thank you.<br> So?<br> So Ken helped. Larry - I don't know.<br> Jesse hurt.<br> What about Sally?<br> Bad, huh?<br> Shit.<br> You wanna go for a drink?<br> No. I have to put together<br> my summation.<br> What are our chances?<br> Fifty-fifty, at best.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Your Honour, my colleagues<br> have agreed to a single summation.<br> No objection, Your Honour.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, the state has<br> charged these three men with a crime.<br> The state has supported that charge<br> with the testimony of two witnesses.<br> Sarah Tobias,<br> who told you how three men raped her,<br> and how she heard other men shouting<br> encouragement to her attackers.<br> Did she name these other men?<br> No.<br> Did she describe these other men?<br> No.<br> Could she tell you<br> what these other men shouted?<br> No.<br> Her sworn testimony - her poignant,<br> heart-rending sworn testimony -<br> was an appeal to your pity.<br> And if her story is true,<br> you should pity her.<br> But even if her story is true<br> and you do pity her,<br> that has nothing to do with this case,<br> because those three men<br> did not rape her.<br> Her sworn testimony is nothing,<br> and you must treat it as nothing.<br> Now, if you wish,<br> you can also treat as nothing<br> the testimony of her lover, Larry,<br> who told you<br> what kind of woman she is.<br> And you can treat as nothing<br> the testimony of the bartender, Jesse,<br> who told you that she was so drunk,<br> she could barely stand.<br> And you can treat as nothing<br> the testimony of her friend, Sally,<br> who told you Miss Tobias's intentions<br> when she first saw our clients.<br> Our case does not depend<br> on those witnesses,<br> just as The People's case<br> does not depend on Sarah Tobias.<br> The People's case<br> depends on Kenneth Joyce.<br> If you believe him,<br> you'll convict those three men.<br> And if you don't, you'll acquit them.<br> Do you believe him?<br> Why did Kenneth Joyce testify?<br> Every day for months,<br> he said to himself "I'm guilty."<br> "I'm guilty."<br> Finally he was offered a way<br> to purge that guilt, and he took it.<br> Kenneth Joyce told you<br> he watched a rape<br> and everyone else in that room<br> watched a rape.<br> How did he know that?<br> Did he read their minds?<br> To solicit a crime,<br> you must first know that it is a crime.<br> Who knew it?<br> Kenneth Joyce.<br> Do you think it matters<br> to Kenneth Joyce who shouted?<br> In his mind, every person in that room<br> was guilty. He told you that.<br> And Kenneth Joyce - who is guilty,<br> who did watch a rape and do nothing -<br> will purge himself by bringing down<br> anyone who was in that room.<br> And, of course,<br> at no legal cost to himself,<br> while those three men face prison.<br> Do you believe him?<br> If you do, convict.<br> And if you don't,<br> and I know you don't,<br> acquit.<br> Miss Murphy?<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> Mr Paulsen has told you the testimony<br> of Sarah Tobias is nothing.<br> Sarah Tobias was raped,<br> but that is nothing.<br> She was cut and bruised<br> and terrorised,<br> but that is nothing.<br> All of it happened<br> in front of a howling crowd,<br> and that is nothing.<br> It may be nothing to Mr Paulsen,<br> but it is not nothing to Sarah Tobias.<br> And I don't believe it's nothing to you.<br> Next Mr Paulsen tried to convince you<br> that Kenneth Joyce<br> was the only person there<br> who knew that Sarah Tobias<br> was being raped.<br> The only one.<br> Now, you watched Kenneth Joyce.<br> How did he strike you?<br> Did he seem especially sensitive?<br> Especially observant?<br> Did he seem so remarkable<br> that you immediately thought<br> "Of course. This man would<br> notice things other people wouldn't."<br> Do you believe that Kenneth Joyce saw<br> something those three men didn't see?<br> In all the time that Sarah Tobias<br> was held down on that pinball machine,<br> the others didn't know?<br> Kenneth Joyce confessed to you<br> that he watched a rape and did nothing.<br> He told you that everyone in that bar<br> behaved badly.<br> And he's right.<br> But no matter how immoral it may be,<br> it is not the crime of criminal<br> solicitation to walk away from a rape.<br> It is not the crime of criminal<br> solicitation to silently watch a rape.<br> But it is the crime<br> of criminal solicitation<br> to induce, or entreat, or encourage<br> or persuade another person<br> to commit a rape.<br> "Hold her down", "Stick it to her",<br> "Make her moan".<br> These three men<br> did worse than nothing.<br> They cheered, and they clapped,<br> and they rooted the others on.<br> They made sure<br> that Sarah Tobias was raped,<br> and raped, and raped.<br> Now, you tell me.<br> Is that nothing?<br> - What time is it?<br> - You just asked me that.<br> They want Ken Joyce's testimony<br> read to them again.<br> I don't get it.<br> That's the third time for him.<br> - How come they never ask for mine?<br> - Because they believed you.<br> Look, I did your chart. You're really<br> gonna like this. This is great.<br> Look at this. Saturn in the tenth house<br> is career and ambition.<br> Mercury ruling the tenth, public work.<br> And you had Sun and Pluto in the tenth.<br> That's law and higher understanding.<br> I'm tellin' you,<br> the tenth house is really excellent.<br> You could be president or something.<br> What about you? What's your future?<br> I forgot it at home.<br> Don't you remember it?<br> Yeah, it's just...<br> It's seventh house, mostly. It's like<br> feelings, faith, intuition, mystery.<br> Really useful shit.<br> Do I have any of that?<br> Yeah, you do.<br> You got a little bit right there. See that?<br> Keep it.<br> I was gonna sign it, but I figured<br> you're not really into that kind of stuff.<br> Will you sign it, please?<br> Thank you.<br> Likewise.<br> Still no verdict in the precedent-setting<br> Tobias trial. As the jury continues...<br> On the second day of deliberations, the<br> jury shows no signs of a quick verdict...<br> The jury has been out for two days.<br> While both sides express confidence,<br> one thing is certain:<br> This will be an historic decision.<br> They're coming in.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> have you reached a verdict?<br> We have, Your Honour.<br> Will the defendants please rise<br> and face the jury.<br> We find the defendant Matthew Haines<br> guilty of criminal solicitation.<br> We find the defendant Stuart Holloway<br> guilty of criminal solicitation.<br> We find the defendant Clifford Albrect<br> guilty of criminal solicitation.<br> Sentence will be imposed<br> two weeks from today at ten.<br> This court is adjourned.<br> Miss Murphy,<br> what was the deciding factor?<br> Well, there were many.<br> - I'm very pleased that it's over.<br> - What are your plans now?<br> I'd like to go home<br> and play with my dog.<br>
