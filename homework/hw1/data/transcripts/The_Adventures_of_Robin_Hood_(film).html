                        News has come from Vienna!<br> "Leopold of Austria has seized King<br> Richard on his return from the Crusades.<br> Our king is being held prisoner.<br> Nothing further is known.<br> His Highness Prince John will make...<br> ... further public<br> pronouncement tomorrow".<br> And how are the dear Saxons<br> taking the news, Sir Guy?<br> They're even more worried than<br> Longchamps, Your Highness.<br> They'll be more than worried...<br> ... when I squeeze the fat<br> out of their hides.<br> - You intend to act on your plans?<br> - What better moment than this, Sir Guy?<br> Whoever would have thought<br> my dear brother...<br> ... would be so<br> considerate as to get captured...<br> ... and leave all of England<br> to my tender care?<br> He may disapprove when he returns,<br> Your Highness.<br> If he returns.<br> And I'll see to it that he doesn't.<br> We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.<br> Golden days are ahead.<br> I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow, Your Highness.<br> - But who's gonna pay me?<br> - Pay! Pay!<br> That's all you Saxons think about.<br> Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John,<br> who's just come up from London?<br> Stop! Stop!<br> This man is freeborn!<br> He's a landowner.<br> You can't make a slave of him!<br> Didn't he refuse to send his men<br> to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?<br> But I protest... !<br> Dickon, follow me!<br> The rest remain here.<br> - What's your name, you Saxon dog?<br> - A better one than yours.<br> Look to your manners!<br> This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.<br> Sir Guy or the devil!<br> There's little to choose between them.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Much, the miller's son.<br> - It's death to kill the king's deer?<br> - And death from hunger if I don't.<br> Thanks to you and the rest of you<br> Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.<br> - Be quiet, you.<br> - I won't be quiet!<br> You can kill me if you like,<br> but not until I've had my say.<br> You can beat and starve<br> us Saxons now...<br> ... but when King Richard escapes, he'll<br> take you by the scruff of the neck...<br> ... and fling you into the sea!<br> - What the devil?<br> - Come now, Sir Guy.<br> - You'd kill a man for telling the truth?<br> - If it amused me, yes.<br> Be thankful<br> my humor's of a different sort.<br> By what right do you<br> interfere with justice?<br> By a better right<br> than you have to misuse it.<br> That goes for your master, Prince John.<br> I'll give him that message at the<br> baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.<br> Thank you.<br> He does need a bit of a talking to.<br> - Eh, Will?<br> - He has been getting rather out of hand.<br> - Fetch him.<br> - Hold there. What's his fault?<br> - He's killed a royal deer.<br> - You're wrong. I killed that deer.<br> This man's my servant.<br> Oh. I suppose you realize the penalty<br> for killing the king's deer is death.<br> - Whether for serf or noble.<br> - Really?<br> Are there no exceptions?<br> - Thanks, master.<br> - Better look before you shoot next time.<br> From this day, I follow only you. There<br> isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...<br> ... that doesn't know and bless<br> Sir Robin of Locksley.<br> Take me as your servant.<br> Why, in all the forest,<br> there isn't a hunter as good as me.<br> I ask no pay.<br> Just to follow you.<br> Fetch the deer, then.<br> While Richard is bent on adventure<br> in foreign lands...<br> ... it is our duty as Normans<br> to preserve the realm...<br> ... by giving loyal support<br> to Prince John...<br> ... the only true defender<br> of the Norman spirit.<br> Hail to Prince John.<br> My lords, I thank you.<br> Well, this is what we Normans like:<br> Good food, good company...<br> ... and a beautiful woman<br> to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?<br> Was it worthwhile coming with me<br> from London...<br> ... to see what stout fellows<br> our Nottingham friends are?<br> Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne. One of our<br> most renowned defenders of the realm.<br> Must I take him, Your Highness?<br> Why, you like him, don't you?<br> - Well, he's a Norman, of course.<br> - Is that the only reason for liking him?<br> Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward<br> who must obey her guardian?<br> Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.<br> But he's our most powerful friend in<br> these shires and he's in love with you.<br> If I could promise him marriage<br> to a royal ward, it might help my plans.<br> - Perhaps when I know him better.<br> - Of course.<br> You're a very wise young woman.<br> Any more objections to the new tax<br> from our Saxon friends?<br> Objections, Your Highness?<br> With a Saxon dangling from every...<br> ... gallows tree<br> between here and Charnwood?<br> Well said, sir knight.<br> But not too many, mind.<br> Else we'll have nobody left<br> to till our land or pay the tax.<br> There's one exception I'd make,<br> Your Highness.<br> - A certain Saxon noble.<br> - Who is that?<br> - Sir Robin of Locksley.<br> - Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley?<br> I've heard precious little else since I've<br> been here. What's his latest outrage?<br> Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer<br> in Sherwood Forest today.<br> And you didn't take him?<br> That would have been a problem,<br> Your Highness.<br> - A Saxon a problem?<br> - He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.<br> Aye.<br> An impudent, reckless rogue...<br> ... who goes around the shire<br> stirring up the Saxons against authority.<br> And he has the insolence to set himself<br> up as a protector of the people.<br> I could have captured him<br> long ago, but...<br> But what?<br> Well, he's the deadliest archer<br> in England, and...<br> And my brave High Sheriff<br> of Nottingham is afraid of him.<br> I want him taken and hanged. At once,<br> do you hear? I'll not tolerate...<br> Open the door!<br> Who is this, this... ?<br> - Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.<br> - Ah!<br> Let him approach.<br> Greetings, Your Highness.<br> You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.<br> I no sooner enter his castle doors<br> with a piece of meat...<br> ... than his starving servants<br> try to snatch it from me.<br> You should feed them, Gisbourne.<br> They'll work better.<br> With the compliments of your royal<br> brother, King Richard, God bless him!<br> By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.<br> Robin, I like you.<br> I'm gratified, Your Highness.<br> I don't think Gisbourne shares<br> that sentiment, however.<br> He does look sour.<br> What's the matter, Gisbourne?<br> Run out of hangings?<br> - I know a ripe subject for one.<br> - If you'll excuse me...<br> Sit down! Sit down, my dear.<br> He'll not harm you.<br> Sir Robin, this is<br> the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.<br> I hope my lady had a pleasant journey<br> from London?<br> What you hope can hardly be important.<br> What a pity her manners<br> don't match her looks, Your Highness.<br> You hear that, gentlemen?<br> Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian<br> he daren't say "boo" to her...<br> ... and this saucy fellow<br> gives her better than she sends.<br> My lords and ladies, I would like to<br> present to you Sir Robin of Locksley.<br> Sir Robin, permit me to present to you<br> your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...<br> ... and our noble guests.<br> - I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.<br> - Have you had meat?<br> - None but what I brought.<br> Well, sit down.<br> Sit down there opposite me.<br> - Get up, Sir Ivor. Give him your place.<br> - Your Highness!<br> Get up!<br> Get up, sir knight!<br> Come, Sir Ivor. Out with you.<br> Bring Sir Robin food at once,<br> do you hear?<br> Such impudence must support<br> a mighty appetite.<br> True enough, Your Highness.<br> We Saxons have little to fatten on by<br> the time your tax gatherers are through.<br> Be seated, gentlemen. No need<br> to stand on ceremony on my account.<br> So you think you're overtaxed, eh?<br> Overtaxed, overworked and paid off<br> with a knife, a club or a rope.<br> - Why, you speak treason.<br> - Fluently.<br> I advise you to curb<br> that wagging tongue of yours!<br> It's a habit I've never formed.<br> You know, we Saxons aren't gonna put<br> up with these oppressions much longer.<br> Oh, you're not?<br> Then listen to this:<br> As you may know, my brother<br> is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.<br> And from Leopold, I have received a<br> ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks.<br> That means that you, my friends...<br> ... must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks<br> in the pound, but 3!<br> And the money's to be<br> turned over to me.<br> Why to you, Your Highness?<br> King Richard<br> appointed Longchamps regent.<br> I've kicked Longchamps out.<br> From now on, I am regent of England.<br> Well, confound it,<br> what are you goggling at?<br> Is it so strange that I decide to rule<br> when my brother's a prisoner?<br> Who's to say I shouldn't?<br> - You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?<br> - Not I, Your Highness.<br> - You, Sir Boron?<br> - Nor I, Your Highness.<br> - You, Sir Ralf of Durham?<br> - My sword is yours, Your Highness.<br> And what about our young<br> Saxon cockerel here?<br> What's the matter?<br> Have you no stomach for honest meat?<br> For honest meat, yes.<br> But I've no stomach for traitors.<br> - You call me traitor?<br> - You? Yes.<br> And every man here<br> who offers you allegiance.<br> Your Highness.<br> What do you call a man who takes<br> advantage of a king's misfortune...<br> ... to seize his power?<br> And now, with the help<br> of this sweet band of cutthroats...<br> ... you'll try to grind a ransom for him<br> out of every helpless Saxon.<br> A ransom that'll be used<br> not to release Richard...<br> ... but to buy your way to the throne.<br> Let me ram those words down<br> his throat, Your Highness!<br> Oh, no. Later.<br> Let him spout for the moment.<br> And what do you propose to do?<br> I'll organize revolt.<br> Exact a death for a death.<br> And I'll never rest until every Saxon<br> in this shire can stand up, free men...<br> ... and strike a blow<br> for Richard and England.<br> - Have you finished?<br> - I'm only just beginning.<br> From this night on, I use every means<br> in my power to fight you.<br> Dickon!<br> Such impudence, Your Highness.<br> If I could only reach him.<br> Stand back! Stand back!<br> Open the door!<br> Quick, guards, quick!<br> There's a traitor inside trying to escape!<br> - Shut the door!<br> - Traitor, sir?<br> You infernal idiot!<br> Which way did he go?<br> There, through the gate.<br> - After him!<br> - Guards! Horses!<br> Dickon, follow Mansfield!<br> To your troop!<br> Up you go, quick.<br> Find Crippen<br> the arrow-maker and his friends...<br> ... to pass the word to every man<br> who's been beaten or tortured:<br> The Gallows Oaks<br> in Sherwood tomorrow.<br> - Yes, master.<br> - Off you go, and good luck.<br> Have it proclaimed in every village<br> that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.<br> Hang anybody<br> that gives him shelter or aid.<br> Yes, Your Highness.<br> His possessions are forfeit to the crown.<br> Seize his castle and his lands.<br> Everything he owns.<br> And just to let the people know<br> how the wind has changed...<br> ... the sooner you begin collecting the...<br> - The ransom, Your Highness?<br> Yes, yes, of course.<br> The ransom.<br> There's a death sentence<br> for your Robin of Locksley!<br> I'll have him dangling in a week.<br> - I'm tired.<br> - What?<br> After a refreshing sleep<br> in the greenwood?<br> I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.<br> - Lovely fresh air.<br> - My teeth ache with chattering.<br> - Nightingales singing.<br> - An owl hooting in my ear all night.<br> Hooting?<br> He was singing you to sleep.<br> There's a lusty infant. He'd be<br> a good one to reason into joining us.<br> By the look of him, his<br> quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.<br> - Let's see what he's made of.<br> - It's your skull, not mine.<br> - Give way, little man.<br> - Only to a better man than myself.<br> He stands before you.<br> Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm<br> to brawl with such a windbag.<br> When I've brushed this fly off,<br> I'll give you a dusting for good measure.<br> This fly has a mighty sting, friend.<br> I've only a staff and you threaten me<br> with a longbow and a goose shaft.<br> - Aren't you man enough... ?<br> - Wait! I'll get myself a staff.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yes.<br> Pretty fellow, play a livelier tune that<br> I can make this puny rascal dance to.<br> You need a merrier tune?<br> Well, how's this?<br> Ha!<br> Ha!<br> If you want a lesson,<br> you came to the right man!<br> - Where is he?<br> - Who?<br> - This quarterstaff master.<br> - Here.<br> Give my compliments to him.<br> My friend, I should ask payment<br> for what I'm teaching you here today.<br> There's something on account.<br> There's your change.<br> My head hums like a swarm of bees.<br> What's your name, friend?<br> - John Little. What's yours?<br> - Robin.<br> - Not Robin of Locksley?<br> - Aye.<br> - Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.<br> - 'Twas he who did the falling in.<br> I wanted to see what you were made of.<br> And I did.<br> - I hope you'll not hold it against me.<br> - On the contrary.<br> - I love a man that can best me.<br> - I'd like to join your company.<br> You shall. If you can hold a breach<br> like you held that bridge...<br> ... you're one of us. Welcome.<br> - This is Will of Gamwell.<br> - Yeah.<br> - He took care not to wet his feathers.<br> - Just brain over brawn, friend.<br> You heard Robin's orders.<br> Look nippy now and spread the word.<br> "By royal decree, Robin of Locksley...<br> ... is declared an outlaw,<br> condemned to death".<br> Meet Robin in Sherwood<br> at Gallows Oaks.<br> "Any person aiding him will be hanged".<br> Meet Robin in Sherwood<br> at Gallows Oaks.<br> Robin in Sherwood.<br> At the Gallows Oak.<br> Robin in Sherwood.<br> Robin. Gallows Oak.<br> Gallows Oak.<br> I've called you here as freeborn<br> Englishmen, loyal to our king.<br> While he reigned over us<br> we lived in peace.<br> But since Prince John has seized<br> the regency...<br> ... Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors<br> have murdered and pillaged.<br> You've all suffered from their cruelty.<br> The ear loppings, the beatings...<br> ... the blindings with hot irons,<br> the burning of our homes...<br> ... the mistreatment of our women.<br> It's time we put an end to this!<br> - Robin's right.<br> - Aye!<br> Now, this forest is wide.<br> It can shelter, clothe and feed<br> a band of good, determined men...<br> ... good swordsmen, good archers,<br> good fighters!<br> Men, if you're willing to fight for our<br> people, I want you. Are you with me?<br> Aye! Aye!<br> Then kneel and swear this oath.<br> That you, the freemen of this forest,<br> swear to despoil the rich...<br> ... only to give to the poor.<br> To shelter the old and helpless...<br> ... to protect all women,<br> rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.<br> Swear to fight for a free England.<br> To protect her loyally until the return<br> of our king, Richard the Lion-Heart.<br> And swear to fight to the death<br> against our oppressors!<br> We do! We do solemnly swear!<br> String him up again!<br> - He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.<br> - Oh, he'll die, will he?<br> Another one of their Saxon impudences.<br> They'll do anything to trick us.<br> Continue!<br> - Mercy, good master! Have mercy!<br> - Start him dancing!<br> This will teach you to defy Prince John!<br> Father! Father!<br> Stop!<br> Five men dead. Murdered.<br> Sir Ivor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.<br> - You don't have to name them.<br> - Our men can't lay a hot iron...<br> ... in the eyes of a tax dodger without<br> getting an arrow in the throat.<br> - He's got to be stopped!<br> - Have you tried to stop him?<br> Yes, but I couldn't find him.<br> What chance has anyone of finding him?<br> Every villager<br> and woodcutter's his friend.<br> Every runaway serf and Saxon thief<br> in the shire is joining him.<br> I've sent spies in the forest<br> to find out his hiding place...<br> ... but he strikes, and gone like a flash.<br> - While you stay safely at home.<br> Do you question my valor?<br> Am I not commanding the force...<br> ... that goes with Sir Guy and<br> Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle...<br> ... to guard the tax money he is bringing<br> back, with my sword and life?<br> I only hope this murderer<br> does come out of his hiding place.<br> You hope!<br> Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this<br> outlaw by the heels when I get back.<br> Well, well. A curtal friar,<br> and a mighty fat one at that.<br> - He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.<br> - Be careful, Robin.<br> That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.<br> He's noted...<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> Noted for his piety.<br> A humble soul, he is,<br> with a heart as gentle as a lamb.<br> - Be easy with him, master.<br> - Oh, I won't harm him.<br> You stay here lest you frighten him.<br> Don't interfere.<br> That's one of the most<br> dangerous swordsmen...<br> Shh!<br> Bless my soul, a miracle!<br> Robber! Thief!<br> Give me back my mutton joint!<br> Whoa!<br> If you're a robber<br> you'll get nothing from me.<br> I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.<br> If this is poverty,<br> I'll gladly share it with you.<br> That's what you are doing.<br> Give me back my mutton joint!<br> Not so close, my ponderous one.<br> - I'd have a word with you.<br> - Well?<br> I live in the forest with good fellows...<br> ... who've everything in life<br> save spiritual guidance.<br> And no merit but one.<br> - And what's that?<br> - We're outlaws.<br> Since we're newborn to the greenwood,<br> we need someone to do our christenings.<br> - So we've chosen you.<br> - Not I.<br> They've probably<br> all got your taking ways.<br> Of course.<br> But you'll love them, one and all.<br> Let's waste no more time. We'll<br> take the shortcut across the stream.<br> - Come.<br> - I'll not. I'm happy here.<br> - You will come.<br> - Ah!<br> Now, since I don't care<br> to get my feet wet...<br> ... you'll carry me across on your back.<br> - On my back?<br> - Bend! You must learn obedience.<br> Come on, bend.<br> On, now!<br> Come on! On! On! Faster!<br> I'll have a gallop from you yet.<br> Come now, fat one. Why not give up?<br> You can see I'm a better swordsman.<br> After I let a little air into your bellows<br> you'll whistle a different tune.<br> By Our Lady,<br> you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.<br> Must we go on, then?<br> I think we're even now, friar.<br> Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me<br> by half a leg of mutton.<br> - So...<br> - No. Hold there, friar. Enough.<br> Come with me and I'll promise you<br> the finest venison pasty...<br> ... and the biggest you ever ate.<br> Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.<br> If you'd said that before, you'd have<br> saved us both a wetting. Come along.<br> - You'll join us?<br> - Aye.<br> If only to convert you<br> from your thieving ways.<br> You're Robin Hood, aren't you?<br> The holy henchman!<br> Hail, doubting friar!<br> - Robin.<br> - Aye?<br> He's well named Friar Tuck.<br> It would take half the deer<br> in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.<br> And twice that to fill your empty head.<br> - Whoa, Will!<br> - What news, Will?<br> - I've got word...<br> - It's all right. He's one of us.<br> One of us?<br> He looks like three of us.<br> Aye.<br> And equal to a full dozen.<br> Now, now, now, now.<br> Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?<br> Sir Guy of Gisbourne<br> is stopping by the way tonight.<br> - Has he got the tax money?<br> - A fortune!<br> - He enters Sherwood when?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> We'll have to postpone that stuffing<br> match, but it'll be double tomorrow!<br> Come! Back to camp, men!<br> Here, curb your appetite with that.<br> - Are you ready, men?<br> - Aye.<br> Aye!<br> - See anything of them?<br> - Not yet.<br> Is everything ready?<br> They'll think they've got into<br> a blooming hornet's nest.<br> There they come.<br> Hadn't we better<br> send out flanking guards?<br> What for?<br> This is Sherwood, and Robin Hood...<br> - Afraid of that gallows-face?<br> - Afraid? Certainly not, sir.<br> But it's here that he's boldest.<br> Don't worry. We're more<br> than enough to take care of him.<br> Outlaws have no face to show<br> themselves against armed troops.<br> Are you sure?<br> I seem to remember...<br> He jumps out of ambush at small parties,<br> but he wouldn't dare to attack us.<br> - Well, you old rooster, what do you see?<br> - Make ready. They're in two sections.<br> - Do you see Sir Guy?<br> - He's leading the second.<br> The treasure wagon is with him.<br> Robin! Sir Guy and the sheriff<br> are watering their horses.<br> - The advance guard's far ahead.<br> - Good. Little John!<br> Take your men<br> and cut off the first section.<br> - Surround the advance guard.<br> - Aye!<br> Personally!<br> - Ready, men?<br> - Aye, Robin!<br> Then stand ready for the signal. Come,<br> Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.<br> - Look!<br> - The guard! Quick!<br> Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.<br> What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?<br> Why, that's curious.<br> I've often heard you'd give me a<br> warm welcome if ever we met again.<br> - You're permitting this without even... ?<br> - Fighting?<br> - I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.<br> - Well, I have, you impudent rascal!<br> You're not going to harm my lamb,<br> my honeysuckle.<br> Be still, Bess.<br> We've nothing but peaceful intentions.<br> Have we, men?<br> We only want to stroke his pretty neck.<br> - We won't harm him much.<br> - You see?<br> Well, let's away.<br> Don't bother to mark the way.<br> It'll take keener men than you've got...<br> ... to find our camp again.<br> - You'll hang for this, all of you.<br> A small price to pay for the company<br> of such a charming lady.<br> What can a Saxon hedge-robber<br> know of charm? Or ladies?<br> - She means you.<br> - Me? A hedge-robber?<br> You must tell me more about myself.<br> You may have been misinformed.<br> Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting<br> enough to bother about.<br> You just harm one hair<br> of my lady's head...<br> ... and that ugly face of yours will walk<br> about with no neck under it. Now, mind!<br> - What are you staring at?<br> - I ain't never been out walking...<br> ... with a female before.<br> - What female?<br> - You.<br> - Well, of all the impudence!<br> I suppose you say that to all women<br> that tickle your fancy.<br> I've never tickled<br> a woman's fancy before.<br> No, I've never had a sweetheart.<br> Do you mean to say you never had one<br> single sweetheart in all your life?<br> You don't know what you missed,<br> my lad.<br> I've had the bands on five times.<br> My lord! Your robes for the feast.<br> Hurry up, put them on.<br> - I won't!<br> - You will!<br> I will! I will!<br> To them, this is heaven.<br> Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches,<br> limitless food instead of hunger.<br> - Why, they're actually happy.<br> - Are they?<br> Aren't you even a little pleased<br> to see them enjoying themselves?<br> I think it's revolting.<br> Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it,<br> my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.<br> But if you could know these people<br> as I know them.<br> Their patience, loyalty, goodness.<br> Friar Tuck!<br> These should fit Sir Guy.<br> Me lord. Here is your raiment<br> for the banquet.<br> When you've done with them,<br> give them to Prince John.<br> To the tables, everybody,<br> and stuff yourselves!<br> May I serve you, my lady?<br> I'm afraid the company<br> has spoiled my appetite.<br> Misfortune.<br> Now, mine is excellent.<br> Ah.<br> - A little mutton, my lady?<br> - I said I'm not hungry.<br> Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.<br> Well, you will let me know<br> if you regain your appetite, won't you?<br> Friends! Friends!<br> I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy<br> of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...<br> ... and a bitter enemy of ours.<br> And yet, look!<br> He provides us with this tasty supper.<br> And is this the end of his beneficence?<br> Why, no!<br> For in his train today...<br> ... he's brought us half a score<br> of boxes full of jewels and silks...<br> ... and more, about 30,000 golden marks<br> wrested from the northern shires.<br> - You wouldn't dare.<br> - Sit down!<br> Some of you might think our host...<br> ... intended this treasure<br> for the coffers of Prince John...<br> ... instead of to ransom the king.<br> And you would be right.<br> But a strange thing happened.<br> A change of heart overtook him in the<br> forest, and there it is, safe and sound!<br> - You speak of loyalty.<br> - Yes. Why not?<br> I suppose you and your cutthroats<br> intend to send this treasure to Richard?<br> You wouldn't dream<br> of keeping it yourselves.<br> Friends! What shall we do with this<br> treasure? Divide it amongst ourselves?<br> - Hold it for Richard!<br> - It belongs to the king!<br> - Convinced?<br> - I may have been hasty...<br> But why you, a knight...<br> ... should live here like an animal,<br> robbing, killing, outlawed... ?<br> Are you really interested in learning<br> why I turned outlaw?<br> Or are you afraid of the truth?<br> Or of me, perhaps?<br> I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.<br> Good. Then come with me.<br> Oh, so you are afraid.<br> Sit down! Sit down!<br> - Well, men.<br> - Hi!<br> Hardly an inspiring sight<br> for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.<br> But these poor devils<br> have all had their homes burned.<br> Their families beaten and starved<br> to death by your tax gatherers.<br> - Bless you. We'll never forget you.<br> - Our humble thanks, master.<br> - May we be worthy, Robin.<br> - You are, mother, you are.<br> - Have you eaten well, friend?<br> - Yes, thanks, Robin Hood.<br> We humbly thank you, master.<br> I'm sorry to have to show you that.<br> But once these poor people<br> were happy and contented.<br> Just simple villagers<br> who never harmed a soul.<br> And now... Tortured, eyes put out,<br> tongues slit, ears hacked off.<br> They come to me for protection<br> against your Norman friends.<br> But you've taken Norman lives.<br> Yes, those that deserved it.<br> The cruel and unjust.<br> You're a strange man.<br> Strange? Because I can feel for beaten,<br> helpless people?<br> No, you're strange because you want<br> to do something about it.<br> You're willing to defy Sir Guy,<br> even Prince John himself.<br> To risk your own life.<br> - And one of those men was a Norman.<br> - Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?<br> - It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.<br> - But it's lost you your rank, your lands.<br> It's made you a hunted outlaw...<br> ... when you might have<br> lived in comfort and security.<br> What's your reward for all this?<br> Reward?<br> You just don't understand, do you?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I do begin to see a little now.<br> If you do, then that's reward enough.<br> Now that you've robbed us and had your<br> fill of insulting us, we wish to leave.<br> - Come, Lady Marian.<br> - My men will escort my lady.<br> But before you leave, it might be well<br> if you thanked her for saving your life.<br> My life?<br> Do you think you'd have<br> left this forest alive...<br> ... if it hadn't been<br> for her presence here?<br> - Peter! Harold!<br> - Master?<br> Take six men and guide our loyal host<br> and his nervous friend...<br> ... to the Nottingham Road.<br> - But our horses, our clothes.<br> You'll return to Nottingham<br> as you are, on foot.<br> This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson<br> to you in humility, if not in mercy.<br> - Your people will be returned tomorrow.<br> - But the lady Marian.<br> You'd best be started<br> before I have a change of mind.<br> I think we'd better go.<br> Now, my lady.<br> Friar Tuck! Little John!<br> Take the lady<br> to the Abbey of the Black Canons...<br> ... so tomorrow the bishop<br> can escort her the rest of the way.<br> - Oh, master, may I go too?<br> - With your permission, my lady?<br> Goodbye, my lady.<br> Goodbye.<br> - He took everything you collected?<br> - Every silver penny.<br> And you two nincompoops sat there<br> and let him do it.<br> - Oh, we resisted as well as we could.<br> - Where are your wounds? Your bruises?<br> - And where are your men?<br> - What did Your Highness expect?<br> With the Lady Marian in our company<br> and Locksley's men outnumbering us.<br> And not an arrow wound to divide<br> among them, I suppose.<br> And more than 30,000 marks<br> in the hands of that wolf's head.<br> That fellow's got to be taken.<br> Understand?<br> And how does Your Highness suggest<br> that he be taken?<br> - If I may be so bold as to inquire?<br> - Mind your words, Gisbourne.<br> You're fortunate not to be paying<br> for this with your head.<br> Your Highness, sir, I could muster<br> an army and surround Sherwood.<br> - You couldn't capture him...<br> - Mind your words.<br> ... if he sat in your lap<br> shooting arrows at a crow.<br> Arrows! Arrows!<br> - He said shooting arrows at a crow.<br> - Take that silly looking bonnet off.<br> That stirs something in my mind.<br> Perhaps we can't take him by force.<br> He's too well protected. Knows<br> Sherwood's hidden paths well. But...<br> - But what?<br> - We'll outwit him.<br> We'll hold an archery tournament!<br> Archery tour...<br> And have him fly in on the end of one<br> of his own arrows? That's marvelous.<br> He's the finest archer in the North.<br> Think he'd forgo shooting...<br> ... against the archers of all England?<br> We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.<br> And ask him to risk his neck for that?<br> That won't be the only bait...<br> ... with the Lady Marian presenting<br> the arrow herself.<br> What do you mean?<br> When they came out of the forest,<br> she seemed very friendly.<br> And didn't you notice<br> how his eyes never left her?<br> - Yes, yes, I noticed.<br> - Well, then!<br> - Well, then, how do we get word to him?<br> - Get word to Robin...<br> ... who has an eye in every bush<br> and ears in every wall?<br> But even if he comes,<br> won't he be disguised?<br> Whether he be dressed as priest,<br> beggar, knight...<br> ... palmer, what disguise can conceal<br> the finest archer in England?<br> The man who wins the golden arrow<br> will be Robin Hood.<br> Will you take that bonnet off?<br> I hope our little golden hook<br> will catch the fish.<br> - You hope?<br> - Oh, it will if he's here.<br> If he's not, we'll stick your head<br> upon the target and shoot at that.<br> - Are your men sure of their orders?<br> - Yes.<br> They're stationed all around the field.<br> Even a worm couldn't get through.<br> You talk as if this were a trap.<br> No, my dear. Just a precaution in case<br> the Saxons create a disturbance.<br> By orders of His Highness Prince John...<br> ... the champions<br> of Sir Guy and the knights...<br> ... will be limited to three flights<br> of arrows for the eliminations.<br> The winning team will meet all comers.<br> - You know it's a trap.<br> - A golden arrow, from the lady herself.<br> - They've cooked this up to take you.<br> - Well, what of it?<br> - You know what'll happen if they do.<br> - Where's your sporting blood?<br> Sir Guy accepted our invitation.<br> We'd be rude not to accept his.<br> - It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.<br> - There, my band getting fat and overfed.<br> Where's your love of fights,<br> risk, adventure?<br> Since our friend seems to have gone<br> a little mad, I'll have to see him through.<br> We'll have to see him through.<br> Prepare final flight.<br> Does my lady find it interesting?<br> Lady Marian?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - I asked if you found it interesting.<br> Yes, very.<br> They're splendid archers.<br> You'll find it much more<br> interesting later on.<br> The winning team will compete<br> as individuals.<br> Captain Phillip of Arras.<br> Elwyn the Welshman.<br> Matt of Sleaford.<br> They now challenge all comers.<br> The men who'd shoot against that lot<br> have to have the eyes of a falcon.<br> They're far too good for me.<br> I'm not shooting today.<br> Remaining archers will use<br> center target.<br> Matt of Sleaford, out!<br> Elwyn the Welshman, out!<br> - Ah! The tall tinker.<br> - Now is the time.<br> Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying<br> myself. Let them finish the match.<br> - But he could...<br> - Have your men close in if you wish.<br> Look.<br> Yeah, they're closing in.<br> I hope Robin sees them.<br> I must commend Your Highness<br> for the subtlety of your scheme.<br> Very good. Would you say you'd seen<br> that tall fellow before?<br> And if I had, what interest<br> could a tinker have for me?<br> Phillip of Arras shoots next.<br> Tie!<br> You will be allowed another flight.<br> Target's a deal too close. Can we have<br> it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?<br> Another 20 paces!<br> If your archer captain<br> wins at that distance...<br> ... I'll give you<br> Win or lose, I'll give him<br> to Your Highness for a favor.<br> Provided you let me deal<br> with this wolf's head in my own way.<br> Done. I'm leaving for Norwich right<br> after the tournament anyway...<br> ... so you may do what you please<br> with him.<br> Why, he can't win now.<br> No living man could beat that shot.<br> I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras!<br> He split Phillip's arrow.<br> The tinker wins! He wins!<br> - What is your name, archer?<br> - Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.<br> How is it that a tinker learned so well<br> the use of arms?<br> Even a peaceful tinker...<br> ... must protect himself these days<br> from treachery and other things.<br> It's earned you more<br> than you bargained for today.<br> I pronounce you champion archer<br> of England.<br> From the gracious hand of Lady Marian<br> Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.<br> Advance.<br> I... Here is your prize, sir archer.<br> It's indeed an honor to receive it<br> from the hands of so beautiful a lady.<br> - How is it you didn't use a black arrow?<br> - That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.<br> - Its verdict is always final.<br> - Arrest this man!<br> That's a good idea.<br> You're a very rash young man.<br> And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham to<br> see what Gisbourne has in store for you.<br> - It'll be something special, I'm sure.<br> - I'm sure.<br> Sorry I underestimated you.<br> Next time perhaps...<br> There'll be no next time.<br> Take him away!<br> "Robin of Locksley. Known to<br> some as the outlaw Robin Hood.<br> After trial, in which you did not produce<br> one witness in your behalf...<br> ... you've been found guilty of outlawry,<br> murder, abduction...<br> ... false pretenses,<br> contempt of the Crown...<br> ... poaching in forests<br> and high treason".<br> Haven't you forgotten<br> a count or two?<br> Surely it's a crime under the noble<br> Prince John to love one's country.<br> To protect serfs from injustice<br> and be loyal to one's king.<br> If I could add anything to the charges<br> against you, I would most gladly do so.<br> "It is the sentence of this tribunal, on<br> the morrow at high noon you be taken...<br> ... to the square in Nottingham and there<br> hanged by the neck until you are dead".<br> There may be some who will regret<br> that a man of your peculiar talents...<br> ... should be cut off so early in life. But...<br> You think the sentence extremely<br> lenient. Thank you.<br> What's troubling you, my lady?<br> Is it the outlaw?<br> Yes. I hate to see a human<br> being trapped...<br> Bess, you know where his men<br> may be found, don't you?<br> - Why, my lady, how should I know?<br> - Don't put me off.<br> That little man who liked you.<br> You've been seeing him?<br> - Yes, my lady.<br> - Tell me where.<br> - Do you want to send a message?<br> - To his men, yes.<br> Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale<br> of a night, just now and again...<br> ... at a place in the town and I won't<br> deny as some of the others were there.<br> Where was it?<br> Oh, Bess, please tell me!<br> It was a tavern, my lady.<br> The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.<br> - The landlord's name is Humility Prin.<br> - Humility Prin.<br> Knock at the door and say,<br> "A Locksley".<br> - "A Locksley".<br> - Yes, but...<br> Get me a cloak, quickly!<br> Yes, madame. Oh, dear...<br> - But there must be some way...<br> - Couldn't we storm the place?<br> Why, you'd need an army<br> with a battering ram to even dent it.<br> Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.<br> Maybe Little John's right.<br> Perhaps we...<br> A Locksley.<br> - What is it, Prin?<br> - A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.<br> - What?<br> - It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.<br> She has the password, all right.<br> - Is she alone?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Fetch her in.<br> - What do you want, my lady?<br> - I want to help him.<br> - How did you find us here?<br> - Never mind that now.<br> Please don't stand there staring.<br> Tell me what I can do.<br> - Don't trust her. It's a trick.<br> - Would I come alone if it were a trap?<br> What's to prevent your killing me if... ?<br> Is there no one here<br> with sense enough to see?<br> One moment.<br> We have to make sure, my child.<br> You're a good daughter of the church?<br> You swear by Our Lady<br> that you want to help Robin?<br> I swear, good Father.<br> - Have you thought of a way?<br> - Yes.<br> - Can you get us in the castle?<br> - That's no good. He's heavily guarded.<br> But I thought of another way.<br> Listen.<br> - This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?<br> - Yes, isn't it?<br> With Locksley out of the way,<br> we'll stamp out the rest.<br> Won't it be a pleasant surprise<br> for Prince John when he returns?<br> To think that I was once foolish enough<br> to believe that you rather liked him.<br> Why, your hand is trembling.<br> We Saxons won't forget you,<br> Robin Hood!<br> Take him to the gallows.<br> Take him up there.<br> He'll not be so insolent<br> when they've stretched his neck.<br> Get ready.<br> Stop him!<br> Stop! Guards!<br> Friar Tuck! Much!<br> - Here we are, sir!<br> - Here, safe and sound!<br> Back to camp!<br> Robin! Where are you?<br> Here I am. Stand by!<br> He is different<br> from anyone I've ever known.<br> He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless,<br> and yet he's gentle and kind.<br> He's not brutal like...<br> Tell me, when you are in love, is it...<br> ... well, is it hard to think of anybody<br> but one person?<br> Yes, indeed, and sometimes<br> there's a bit of trouble sleeping.<br> I know,<br> but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.<br> Yes, and it affects your appetite too.<br> Not that I've noticed<br> it's done that to you...<br> ... except when he was<br> waiting to be hanged.<br> Does it make you want<br> to be with him all the time?<br> Yes. And when he's with you,<br> your legs are weak as water.<br> Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you,<br> do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...<br> ... like goosy pimples running<br> all up and down your spine?<br> - Then there's not a doubt of it.<br> - Doubt of what?<br> That you're in love!<br> What do you want?<br> Robin!<br> - I must say. I must say!<br> - Keep quiet, Bess.<br> Are you completely mad?<br> - Why did you come here?<br> - To see you.<br> But don't you realize that... ?<br> My men told me what you did for me,<br> so I've come to thank you.<br> And after what I couldn't help<br> overhearing about that prickly feeling...<br> ... I'm very glad I did come.<br> That was a game.<br> Now, you've got to go at once!<br> A game?<br> Well, couldn't I join in?<br> Of course, I probably wouldn't be<br> as good at it as this pretty young girl.<br> But I could do my best.<br> Bess, will you leave us?<br> Please!<br> Now, let's see,<br> where does this game begin?<br> Oh, I know. It's simple.<br> We'll start where you're in love with me.<br> You are, aren't you?<br> Because I am with you, terribly.<br> That's why I came.<br> I had to see you again.<br> You must go at once.<br> And I don't love you.<br> - Oh! Are you sure?<br> - Yes.<br> Very well then, I'll go.<br> This is rather unfriendly of you,<br> exposing me to my enemies like this.<br> Let me see. There's a fat old captain<br> of the guard down there with bow legs.<br> If I drop on him<br> that'll bend them out worse.<br> An archer! He's too thin.<br> I might miss him altogether.<br> - Robin!<br> - The very thing.<br> Five men-at-arms in a group.<br> They'll break the fall beautifully.<br> - Goodbye, my lady!<br> - Robin!<br> - Yes?<br> - Please.<br> Then you do love me? Don't you?<br> - Don't you?<br> - You know I do.<br> Well, that's different.<br> - Do you know you're very impudent?<br> - Me?<br> You are!<br> When my guardian, King Richard, finds<br> out about your being in love with me...<br> - I know, he'll make me court jester.<br> - He won't!<br> He'll stick your funny head<br> on London Gate.<br> And a fine decoration it will be,<br> my bold Norman beauty.<br> - I'm not bold.<br> - Well, you're Norman.<br> Well, I don't hold that against you.<br> And you are a beauty.<br> - You're the most beautiful...<br> - You're leaving at once.<br> Please, darling, every minute<br> you're here you're in danger.<br> I'll go.<br> - Marian, will you come with me?<br> - To Sherwood?<br> I've nothing to offer you but a life of<br> hardship and danger...<br> ... but we'd be together.<br> - But, Robin, dear...<br> - It's asking a lot, but who knows...<br> ... how long it'll be<br> before Richard returns.<br> Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?<br> Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.<br> Even the danger would mean nothing<br> if you were with me.<br> Then you will?<br> No. Listen to me, darling. You<br> remember that day in Sherwood Forest?<br> I realized then for the first time<br> that what you were doing was right...<br> ... and that we were wrong.<br> No, let me finish.<br> You taught me England<br> is bigger than Normans and Saxons...<br> ... fighting and hating each other.<br> That it belongs to all of us,<br> to live peacefully together...<br> ... loyal only to Richard and to England.<br> But, darling, you could help.<br> I could help much more<br> by watching for treachery here...<br> ... and leaving you free to protect<br> Richard's people until he returns.<br> Now do you see why<br> you have to go back to your men alone?<br> Go now, quickly, dearest.<br> - Goodbye, darling.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, my love.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - You gentlemen have traveled far?<br> - Yes, quite a distance.<br> I'm sorry I can't give you better food.<br> - There is little left to us these days.<br> - This will be enough.<br> The inn at Luton was well supplied.<br> How is that?<br> Ah. That's a Norman inn.<br> But it's an outrage!<br> I'll complain to Prince John.<br> I'll have this rascal's ears,<br> no matter how. Dares to rob me!<br> Strip my person of jewels!<br> What's this country coming to...<br> ... when a churchman<br> can't travel the forest in safety?<br> - Who's he?<br> - The Bishop of the Black Canons.<br> - Do you wish to go on after dinner?<br> - No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.<br> - I'll stay. Tend to the horses.<br> - Yes, Your Grace.<br> - Bring food to us!<br> - Yes, Your Grace, at once!<br> It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.<br> Robbers at every turn of the road.<br> - What happened, Your Grace?<br> - I told you! We've been robbed.<br> Not a chance to defend ourselves.<br> They burst on us from ambush.<br> - Who did?<br> - Why, Robin Hood, of course.<br> There's no other<br> with impudence enough.<br> Robin Hood again, sire.<br> - You've heard of him, then?<br> - Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.<br> - Oh, then you're strange to this shire?<br> - More or less.<br> What might be your names, gentlemen?<br> They're hardly important enough<br> to deserve your interest.<br> - Landlord, where's our ale?<br> - Coming, sirs.<br> Will you gentlemen<br> be remaining here tonight?<br> We hadn't decided, Your Grace.<br> What would you advise?<br> Well, there's so much danger on<br> the road, you'd be far safer here.<br> We will then, since we'll have<br> the added pleasure of your company.<br> I should like to stay, but I recollected<br> some urgent affairs at my abbey.<br> Some other time, or perhaps you would<br> break your journey...<br> ... and sup with me tomorrow.<br> - Your Grace is too kind.<br> Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen,<br> and God speed you in the morning.<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> The window!<br> Are there beds prepared, landlord?<br> Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.<br> - I'm afraid he suspects, sire.<br> - I fear so.<br> His Grace is a Norman.<br> Did you see the fear on the<br> landlord's face when he came in?<br> I've seen it in the faces<br> of thousands since we returned.<br> I ought never to have left England.<br> I noticed when Robin Hood's<br> name is mentioned...<br> The mysterious outlaw<br> whom we have sought.<br> In vain. However, the bishop<br> didn't have any difficulty meeting him.<br> Which gives me an idea.<br> - And you're sure it was Richard?<br> - No doubt of it.<br> How like my dear brother this is!<br> He couldn't rot in Durnstein<br> like any decent man.<br> - But Richard has no army.<br> - No, Your Highness.<br> - If he had, we should have heard of it.<br> - If my brother were to be killed...<br> - England would have a new king.<br> - That would be murder! I'll have no part...<br> You'll do as you're told! That's<br> very simple. Keep your mouth closed.<br> Your Highness, I beg of you!<br> How long will you retain your abbey<br> if Richard survives to find out...<br> ... what you've been up to<br> these years he's been away?<br> Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to... ?<br> Dickon was a knight before<br> your brother hacked off his spurs...<br> ... over some little mischance.<br> There's nothing he wouldn't do for<br> a king who'd restore him to rank.<br> - You don't love my brother, I hear.<br> - I have little reason to, Your Highness.<br> - You know this tavern?<br> - Yes.<br> If Richard dies...<br> Dickon returns to the roll of English<br> knights. Am I not right?<br> With the manor and estate<br> of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.<br> - When shall I start?<br> - Now. How many men will you need?<br> I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.<br> The sooner you're crowned king...<br> The better for my friends?<br> You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.<br> Thank you, Your Majesty.<br> Return to your abbey and make<br> preparations to proclaim me king...<br> ... here in Nottingham,<br> the day after tomorrow.<br> Do you suppose she heard?<br> I don't know.<br> Now you know why Robin's got to find<br> King Richard at once and warn him.<br> Take this note<br> to Much at Saracen's Head.<br> My lady's hearing<br> is a little defective tonight.<br> When you knock at a lady's door as<br> if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.<br> You seem upset.<br> Upset? Why should I be?<br> Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.<br> You've played the innocent long enough.<br> - Let's be frank with one another.<br> - I don't see the need.<br> You're charming, but not exactly<br> clever. You couldn't have failed...<br> ... to overhear what Prince John<br> and I were talking about.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> Please don't trouble to deny it.<br> And your first thought, as Richard's<br> loyal ward, was to warn him.<br> - Am I not right?<br> - Why, how could I warn Richard?<br> How did Locksley and his men<br> arrange his escape...<br> ... from hanging after the archery match?<br> Someone here in the castle<br> must have got word to him.<br> That's ridiculous!<br> When Richard's in danger,<br> what more natural...<br> ... than that you should try<br> to warn him through Locksley?<br> And you do intend to<br> warn him, don't you?<br> - Don't you?<br> - No!<br> If that's true, perhaps<br> you'd explain before Prince John...<br> ... and the Court of Execution<br> the meaning of this.<br> Guard!<br> Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.<br> Not only has she consorted with<br> this Saxon rebel...<br> ... found guilty of outlawry, theft,<br> murder, abduction and high treason...<br> ... but she has betrayed<br> her own Norman people.<br> Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?<br> Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame<br> that I'm a Norman...<br> ... after seeing the things my fellow<br> countrymen have done to England.<br> At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was<br> a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe...<br> ... that the horrors you inflicted<br> on the Saxons weren't just.<br> I know now why you tried so hard<br> to kill this outlaw whom you despised.<br> It's because he was the one man<br> in England who protected the helpless...<br> ... against beasts<br> drunk on human blood!<br> And now you intend<br> to murder your own brother!<br> You'll be sorry you interfered.<br> Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.<br> A prophetic speech, my lady, for that is<br> exactly what is going to happen to you.<br> You wouldn't dare.<br> I'm the royal ward of King Richard<br> and no one but the king himself...<br> ... has the right to condemn me to death.<br> You are quite right, my dear.<br> And it shall be a king who will order<br> your execution for high treason...<br> ... exactly 48 hours from now.<br> Take her away.<br> - You got it all in your stupid head now?<br> - Of course I have.<br> Well, give Robin the whole message<br> exactly like I told it to you.<br> Bess, where was Dickon<br> supposed to find King Richard?<br> Oh, never mind him!<br> What do I care about<br> your kings and thrones and such?<br> Robin has gotta do something<br> to save my baby!<br> Come on, old girl.<br> Robin will look after her, all right.<br> - Where's Dickon heading for?<br> - Kent Road Tavern.<br> Kent Road Tavern?<br> You can save three miles<br> and cut him off through Low Wood.<br> Come on, lass,<br> give us a kiss and wish me luck.<br> Hurry up and take<br> your ugly face out of here.<br> Oh, Much.<br> Oh, you will be careful, won't you?<br> Of course I will.<br> Greetings, sir abbot!<br> - You've traveled far this morning?<br> - Too far to be patient with delay now.<br> Perhaps it's the weight of your purse<br> that wearies you. I can remedy that.<br> If it weighs more than a just amount I'll<br> share it with those who have less.<br> You think I hand my purse<br> to every rough lout who asks for it?<br> You see, sir abbot?<br> We're poor outlaws,<br> with nothing to eat but the king's deer...<br> ... while you have property,<br> rents, and silver. So your purse!<br> I traveled far on the king's business.<br> The silver I have left...<br> ... equals no more than 60 marks.<br> What? Are you<br> friendly to our good King Richard?<br> I love no man better.<br> By that speech<br> you save half your money.<br> Give me 30 marks for the poor.<br> The rest you may keep.<br> Then I can go free?<br> Any friend of Richard's<br> is free of this forest.<br> Would you honor us<br> by sharing meat with us?<br> - Gladly.<br> - Then come.<br> - Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?<br> - I'm called Robin Hood.<br> It seems I've heard of you.<br> - Nothing good, I hope.<br> - Oh, now I remember!<br> How does your loyalty<br> to Richard set on a killer of knights...<br> ... a poacher of the king's deer<br> and an outlaw?<br> Those I kill died from misusing<br> the trust that Richard left them.<br> And the worst rogue of these<br> is the king's own brother.<br> - Oh, then you blame Prince John.<br> - No, I blame Richard.<br> His task was defending his people...<br> ... instead of deserting them<br> to fight in foreign lands.<br> What?<br> You'd condemn Holy Crusades?<br> I'll condemn anything that leaves<br> the task of holding England...<br> ... to outlaws like me.<br> Much!<br> - Much, what's happened to you?<br> - Take me to Robin, quick!<br> - Much, what's happened?<br> - King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!<br> What?<br> Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road<br> Tavern last night to kill the king.<br> - Take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern...<br> - No need, master, no need.<br> I headed Dickon off.<br> He ain't gonna murder no one no more.<br> - But the king? Where is he?<br> - I don't know, master.<br> Men, Richard must be found.<br> He must be brought here for safety.<br> Little John, take a party<br> and scour the country.<br> Friar Tuck, into the town.<br> Will, search every inn and cottage.<br> Don't rest, day or night,<br> until he's found. Understand?<br> You don't need to<br> search for Richard, Robin.<br> He's in good hands. The best in England.<br> What do you mean? Where is he?<br> Here!<br> Sire.<br> All these have remained loyal.<br> Rise, Sir Robin.<br> Rise, men of Sherwood.<br> Sire, Prince John's calling<br> Bishop of the Black Canons...<br> ... to proclaim him king<br> in Nottingham tomorrow.<br> - How'd you learn this?<br> - Lady Marian. She overheard.<br> They've taken her for treason.<br> She's been condemned<br> to the block for warning us.<br> He wouldn't dare<br> execute the king's ward.<br> You underestimate him.<br> To save her and your throne,<br> we've got to act now!<br> By attacking Nottingham castle?<br> Without an army it'll be much<br> too strong. Your men will be killed.<br> If the Bishop of the Black Canons<br> is performing the ceremony tomorrow...<br> ... suppose we visit him<br> at his abbey tonight...<br> ... and persuade him to suggest a way.<br> Brace up. Smile!<br> Wider!<br> Still sure it wasn't you who<br> warned my brother I was in England?<br> Why, sire, believe me, I...<br> Your Grace, smile!<br> You'll sweat the lard<br> off your fat carcass...<br> ... before this day's over,<br> my pudgy friend.<br> And I hope some Norman sword<br> whittles you down to size!<br> Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.<br> Sanctify this thy servant,<br> our royal Prince John.<br> Enrich his noble heart and bestow<br> upon him all princely virtues.<br> Amen.<br> No news of Richard.<br> No. None, Your Highness.<br> Then Dickon must have...<br> Sir Dickon, Your Highness.<br> Of course. Of course.<br> We are ready for the ceremony,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Remember.<br> By what authority do you,<br> John Lackland, Prince of England...<br> ... claim to be crowned this day,<br> sovereign of the realm...<br> ... and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher,<br> to receive the blessing of the church?<br> By right of blood succession.<br> According to the law of the realm.<br> Is it of your own free will<br> that you thus depose your brother...<br> ... Richard the Lion-Heart of England?<br> Richard no longer exists!<br> From this moment forward,<br> I, John, am king of England!<br> Aren't you a little premature, brother?<br> Richard! The Lion-Heart!<br> He's lying! He's an imposter!<br> - The king lives!<br> - Men of Sherwood!<br> Robin Hood!<br> It's a trick of the outlaws!<br> Kill him! Seize him!<br> Did I upset your plans?<br> You've come to Nottingham<br> once too often!<br> When this is over, there'll be<br> no need for me to come again.<br> Your sword, Gisbourne.<br> - Know any prayers, my friend?<br> - I'll say one for you!<br> Save yourself, Robin!<br> The door, quick!<br> Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!<br> But, Richard, Richard! I thought...<br> - You thought I was murdered!<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> I didn't mean to...<br> After all, Richard, I am your brother.<br> Yes, sire, he is your brother.<br> Yes, my brother.<br> I could forgive you if your treachery<br> were against me and not my subjects.<br> I banish you and your followers from<br> England for the remainder of my lifetime.<br> Take them away.<br> See that they leave England.<br> I further banish from my realm<br> all injustices and oppressions...<br> ... which have burdened my people.<br> And I pray that under my rule...<br> ... Normans and Saxons alike<br> will share the rights of Englishmen.<br> Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!<br> What about you, Robin?<br> My sword is yours,<br> sire, now and always.<br> Is there nothing I<br> can grant the outlaw...<br> ... who showed him<br> his duty to his country?<br> Yes, Your Majesty,<br> a pardon for the men of Sherwood.<br> Granted with all my heart.<br> Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!<br> But is there nothing for yourself?<br> There's but one thing else, sire.<br> And do you too wish... ?<br> More than anything in the world, sire.<br> Kneel, Robin Hood.<br> Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,<br> Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...<br> ... and lord of all the lands and manors<br> appertaining thereto.<br> My first command to you, my lord earl...<br> ... is to take in marriage<br> the hand of the Lady Marian.<br> Long live Robin Hood!<br> Long live Robin Hood!<br> Long live Lady Marian!<br> And what say you to that,<br> Baron of Locksley?<br> May I obey all your commands<br> with equal pleasure, sire!<br>
