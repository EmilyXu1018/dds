Sorry I'm late,<br> but one thing and another kept me.<br> You know how it is.<br> Or maybe you don't.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Morning, miss.<br> - Ah, splendid. They've come at last.<br> - Huh?<br> - My rose trees.<br> - You'll stay for tea?<br> Don't mind if I do.<br> I need something in my condition.<br> I'll get a going over when I return.<br> Them Belgians'll call me names.<br> But I don't mind being cussed.<br> They won't fire me.<br> Nobody except yours truly can<br> get up steam on the African Queen.<br> You take sugar I seem to remember,<br> Mr Allnut.<br> - That's right, couple of spoonfuls.<br> - And milk?<br> That's right, miss.<br> - Bread and butter?<br> - That's right, miss.<br> - Brother?<br> - Thank you.<br> Just listen to this stomach of mine.<br> The way it sounds, you'd think<br> I had a hyena inside me.<br> Do have more bread and butter,<br> Mr Allnut.<br> Thanks, miss,<br> I... I don't mind if I do.<br> Excuse me.<br> Queer thing, ain't it?<br> I mean, what do you suppose makes<br> a man's stomach carry on like this?<br> Try a rock cake, Mr Allnut.<br> No, thanks, miss.<br> - Herbie Morton's a bishop.<br> - Huh?<br> - Who's that, dear?<br> - Surely you remember Herbie.<br> Blond, younger than I am, ruddy.<br> He sang a solo at the commemoration.<br> "Holy, Holy", I think.<br> I think I remember.<br> It was so long ago.<br> - He's a bishop now.<br> - Splendid.<br> I'd say Herbie was a bit younger<br> than me, four or five years.<br> It's surprising, really.<br> He wasn't up to much as a student.<br> No more than his share<br> of social graces.<br> - Then, of course, he married well.<br> - Oh.<br> That manufacturer's widow.<br> What was his name?<br> Griggs? Briggs. That was it.<br> Alfred Briggs. Soap flakes, I think.<br> Mrs Alfred Briggs.<br> Not to take anything<br> away from Herbie.<br> - I'm delighted for him.<br> - Of course.<br> Ain't a thing I can do about it.<br> - It was "Holy, Holy".<br> - More tea, Mr Allnut?<br> Thank you, no, miss.<br> I'd better shove off if I'm to get<br> back to the mine by tomorrow.<br> - Don't hurry, Mr Allnut.<br> - Do stay for dinner.<br> Thanks just the same.<br> Oh, uh...<br> I probably won't be coming around<br> this way for a couple of months.<br> Really? What about our mail?<br> There's not gonna be any for a while.<br> - Why not?<br> - The Germans will hold it up.<br> - Why, in Heaven's name?<br> - On account of the war.<br> - War? Where, Mr Allnut?<br> - Europe.<br> Indeed? Between whom?<br> Oh, uh... Germany, England.<br> - England?<br> - That's right.<br> - You really mean war?<br> - That's what they tell me.<br> Germans claim the British started it.<br> British blame the Germans.<br> - What do you know? What's happened?<br> - That's all I can remember.<br> Oh, yes. The French are in it<br> and all them little countries,<br> Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Spain,<br> I forget who's with who.<br> - Is that all you can tell us?<br> - That's all I know.<br> I'll find out more in Lubumbashi.<br> I wonder what our position will be?<br> What harm could be done<br> in this godforsaken place?<br> God has not forsaken this place,<br> as my brother's presence<br> bears witness.<br> - Oh, no offence, miss.<br> - War.<br> Yeah. Yeah, looks like it.<br> Well, I'll be shoving off.<br> Thanks for the tea.<br> Take care of yourselves.<br> Goodbye. Thank you.<br> Goodbye, Mr Allnut.<br> Wretched man. He's a Canadian.<br> Doesn't he realise he's in this, too?<br> Shouldn't we<br> try to get to Lubumbashi?<br> The good shepherd doesn't desert<br> his flock when wolves are prowling.<br> We must ask the Almighty<br> to bless England<br> and carry her<br> through her hour of trial.<br> Rose, go in the house and stay there.<br> What's the meaning of this?<br> How dare you?<br> Ooh!<br> Samuel? Samuel!<br> Dear, here you are,<br> and without your hat on.<br> Didn't you hear me calling?<br> Yes, but I must get the seeds in.<br> It's a bit late... August.<br> But, dear, you know it doesn't matter<br> when one plants in central Africa.<br> Africa?<br> Brother, dear,<br> you're not at all well.<br> A-Africa?<br> I'll help you off with your things.<br> Rose...<br> Brother! Brother! Dear!<br> Smite the Amalekites, oh, Lord.<br> Smite them. Hit them, die.<br> Amen.<br> Cold. Foggy.<br> Where's Rose?<br> - Rose, are you down in the shop?<br> - I'm here.<br> Bring me a nice, hot cup of tea.<br> I'm here, brother, beside you.<br> I try so hard, you know, to study...<br> Hebrew, Greek...<br> I've got no facility.<br> If I don't pass the examinations,<br> I shall volunteer as a missionary.<br> Rose, too.<br> Not comely among the maidens,<br> but she, too, can be a servant<br> in the house of the Lord.<br> Even for such as she,<br> God has a goodly purpose.<br> I'm putting my books away.<br> I'm not working any more.<br> If I don't pass, it'll just mean<br> that God has other work for me.<br> Thy will be done.<br> Oh, no, Lord, if it be thy will,<br> let me distinguish myself.<br> Give me a call...<br> here, in England, at home.<br> Mother would be so proud.<br> Oh, Lord. I have tried so hard.<br> So, they've been here, too, eh?<br> After I left the other day,<br> the drums started in the forest.<br> Pretty soon my boys was moaning.<br> I asked 'em what the trouble was.<br> They said the drums said the soldiers<br> was marching off their people<br> and burning their villages<br> so they couldn't come back.<br> When I got to the mine,<br> everything was a shambles.<br> My boys took one look<br> and bolted into the forest.<br> The way I look at it, they plan<br> to make soldiers of the natives<br> and take over all Africa.<br> - Where's the reverend?<br> - He's in there. He's dead.<br> Oh. Oh, well, now, ain't that awful?<br> If they'd shoot a reverend<br> couldn't do 'em a bit of harm,<br> there ain't nobody safe.<br> They didn't shoot him, Mr Allnut,<br> but they may as well have done.<br> Oh, that's certainly too bad, miss.<br> That's all I can say.<br> When'd he die, miss?<br> He died early this morning.<br> Excuse me, miss.<br> What I mean to say is,<br> what with the climate, the quicker<br> we get him buried the better...<br> if you don't mind<br> my saying so.<br> - You got a spade?<br> - Behind the bungalow.<br> I expect he'd like to be buried<br> in the shade.<br> While I'm digging the grave,<br> you get your things together.<br> We can clear out in a hurry.<br> The Germans might come back anytime.<br> Why should they?<br> They'll be back,<br> looking for the African Queen.<br> They'd give a lot to get their hands<br> on her and what's in her<br> blasting gelatine,<br> cylinders of oxygen and hydrogen,<br> heaps of things<br> them Germans could use.<br> The Germans.<br> I figure we can go somewheres<br> behind an island<br> and talk about what to do.<br> - I'll get ready.<br> Fine. I'll be as quick as I can.<br> Let's go, miss.<br> Let's go while the going's good.<br> Pardon me.<br> Mind taking the tiller, miss?<br> - Huh?<br> - Come on.<br> - But I can't steer.<br> - Come on.<br> A little to starboard, miss.<br> No, no. The other way.<br> Ah. So far so good.<br> Here we are safe and sound.<br> - The question is, what next?<br> - Quite.<br> We got heaps of grub.<br> We're all right.<br> We could stay here for months<br> if we wanted to.<br> Not a bad place to sit out a war.<br> All the comforts of home,<br> including running water.<br> We simply can't remain in this<br> backwater until the war is over.<br> Can't we, miss? You got the map.<br> Show me a way out, I'll take it.<br> The British will attack.<br> Which way will they come?<br> Maybe from the sea, but that would<br> put the Germans between us.<br> Mightn't our soldiers come in<br> from British East?<br> But the war would be over before they<br> hacked through that forest.<br> We're in a bit of a fix, miss.<br> One thing's sure,<br> they won't come up from the Congo.<br> They can't cross that lake<br> while the Luisa's there.<br> - The Luisa?<br> - A 100-ton steamer.<br> The Germans brought her in sections.<br> She's the boss of the lake<br> cos she's got a six-pounder.<br> - What's that?<br> - The biggest gun in central Africa.<br> - I see.<br> - Without the Luisa, it'd be easy.<br> The Germans wouldn't last a month<br> if our men could get across the lake.<br> All that don't get us<br> any closer to home.<br> This river, the Ulanga,<br> runs into the lake, doesn't it?<br> Well, yes, miss, it does.<br> But if you got ideas about going<br> in this launch, get rid of 'em.<br> Why?<br> Well, first off, there's Shona.<br> The Germans have a fort there.<br> If we tried to pass their guns,<br> they'd blow us up.<br> Then there's the rapids.<br> like it was coming from a fire hose.<br> Then the river's called the Bora.<br> They didn't know it was the same<br> river until this Spengler...<br> - He got down it, I remember.<br> - Yes, in a dug-out canoe.<br> With six Swahili paddlers.<br> That was his map you was looking at.<br> Mr Allnut, what's in these boxes<br> with the red lines on them?<br> Oh, them?<br> Well, that's blasting gelatine, miss.<br> - Is it dangerous?<br> - No, miss. That's safety stuff.<br> You can get it wet<br> and it don't do it any harm.<br> You can hit it with a hammer,<br> and it won't go off.<br> Takes a detonator to set it off.<br> - I'll put it over the side for you.<br> - No, we may want it.<br> What are these long, round,<br> torpedo-like things?<br> Oh, them? Them's oxygen<br> and hydrogen cylinders, miss.<br> - Mr Allnut...<br> - I'm still right here.<br> There ain't any other place<br> I could be on a 30-foot boat.<br> You're a machinist, aren't you?<br> Wasn't that your job at the mine?<br> Yes, a kind of jack-of-all-trades,<br> master of none, like they say.<br> - Could you make a torpedo?<br> - How's that, miss?<br> Could you make a torpedo?<br> A torpedo?<br> Ask me to make a dreadnought<br> and do it up right.<br> A torpedo?<br> You don't know what you're asking.<br> There ain't nothing so complicated<br> as the insides of a torpedo.<br> It's got gyroscopes,<br> compressed air chambers...<br> But all those things,<br> they're only to make it go, right?<br> Yeah. Yeah, go<br> and hit what it's aimed at.<br> Well, we've got the African Queen.<br> Uh, how's that, miss?<br> If we were to fill those cylinders<br> with that blasting gelatine<br> and fix them out over the boat,<br> then run the boat against a ship,<br> they'd go off just like a torpedo,<br> wouldn't they?<br> Yeah, if they had detonators<br> in the end.<br> We could get a good head of steam up,<br> and just before she hits,<br> we could dive off, couldn't we?<br> Why, sure, miss. Sure. Absolutely.<br> There's one thing wrong<br> with your idea.<br> There ain't nothing to torpedo.<br> Oh, yes, there is.<br> - Is what?<br> - Something to torpedo.<br> - What's that?<br> - The Luisa.<br> The Luisa?!<br> Oh, now, don't talk silly.<br> You can't do that, honest!<br> We can't get down the Ulanga.<br> Spengler did.<br> If a German did it, we can, too.<br> You never tried it!<br> I never tried shooting myself<br> in the head neither!<br> Trouble is,<br> you don't know anything about boats.<br> In other words, you refuse<br> to help your country<br> - in her hour of need, Mr Allnut?<br> - Huh?<br> Well, I wouldn't put it that way.<br> Just how would you put it, Mr Allnut?<br> All right, have it your way,<br> but don't blame me for what happens.<br> Very well. Let's get started.<br> - What, now, miss?<br> - Yes, now.<br> There ain't two hours of daylight.<br> We can go a long way<br> in two hours.<br> Uh, I'll have to get the old kettle<br> to boiling and...<br> Well, do so, Mr Allnut.<br> "Could you make a torpedo?"<br> "Well, do so, Mr Allnut."<br> A little to starboard, miss.<br> That's right.<br> Hey, you're doing fine, miss.<br> It's really quite easy,<br> isn't it, Mr Allnut?<br> Ah, you got to learn<br> to read the river.<br> Read the river?<br> Yeah. You see that long thing<br> over there,<br> looks kind of like a "v"?<br> That means a snag.<br> - Oh.<br> - This choppy water over here,<br> that means shallow.<br> The Queen don't draw much water,<br> so we can go right over 'em.<br> Most boats would get<br> their bottoms tore up.<br> And when it's smooth and flat<br> like that over there?<br> Does that mean a rock, Mr Allnut?<br> Rocks or hippo, miss.<br> But don't go<br> bumping into no hippo.<br> Makes them awful mad.<br> This boat's only big enough<br> for the two of us.<br> What was the matter, Mr Allnut?<br> Steam pump's full of scum and rust.<br> She gets clogged up.<br> Kicking her starts her<br> working again. I gotta act fast.<br> One of my boys dropped a screwdriver<br> down the safety valve.<br> What would happen<br> if you didn't kick her?<br> Whole boiler'd blow up.<br> But if we're going downstream,<br> why do we need the engine at all?<br> Boat's gotta go fast<br> or you can't steer.<br> If I let the engine die going<br> down the rapids, we'd be goners.<br> - Mr Allnut?<br> - Yes, miss?<br> Why not dismantle the safety valve<br> and remove the screwdriver?<br> I'm gonna do that one of these days.<br> I ain't done it cos I kind of like<br> kicking it. She's all I've got.<br> Ahh...it's kind of hot work,<br> ain't it, miss?<br> I could do with a drink. Excuse me.<br> Oh.<br> You gonna have one, miss?<br> No.<br> - What is it?<br> - Gin, miss.<br> - Something the matter, miss?<br> - No.<br> How'd you like a nice cup of tea?<br> I'd like a cup of tea.<br> It'll taste a little rusty,<br> but we can't have everything, can we?<br> There you are.<br> Get this out of the way.<br> - Sugar, miss?<br> - Thank you.<br> Don't mention it.<br> - A bit of supper, miss?<br> - It's too hot to eat.<br> - How long you been out here, miss?<br> - About 10 years.<br> - What part of England are you from?<br> - The Midlands.<br> - Sounds pretty, anyway.<br> - Yes, it is. It's very pretty.<br> Ever get homesick?<br> It's Sunday afternoons I think of<br> most, the peace and the quiet.<br> Yeah, on Sunday afternoons,<br> I was always sleepin' one off.<br> - This is very, very good.<br> - Yes, it isn't half bad, is it?<br> What brought you to Africa,<br> Mr Allnut?<br> The Zambezi bridge. A whole boatload<br> of us Canucks came to work on it.<br> Don't know why they wanted it,<br> both sides of the river the same,<br> but why does a chicken<br> cross the road?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Nothing, miss.<br> Ah, sometimes I wish I was back<br> rubbing elbows, as they say.<br> There's nothing like the noise of a<br> Saturday night to cheer a fellow up.<br> The rest of the week,<br> I'd be taking orders from somebody.<br> Out here I'm my own boss.<br> Anyway, I was until...<br> Hey, you didn't see any crocodiles,<br> did you, miss?<br> Crocodiles? No.<br> There's no shallows for 'em.<br> The current's too swift.<br> I could do with a bath<br> before I turn in.<br> I'd like a bath myself.<br> Well, I'll go in the bow and<br> hang off the anchor chain,<br> you stay back in the stern<br> and do whatever you have to.<br> As long as we don't look,<br> it won't matter.<br> Well, how about it, miss?<br> Very well, Mr Allnut.<br> That's the ticket.<br> - Mr Allnut!<br> - Right here.<br> I can't get back into the boat.<br> I'll give you a hand.<br> Close your eyes, Mr Allnut.<br> All right.<br> I'm all right, thank you.<br> Mr Allnut!<br> I'm sorry I woke you, miss.<br> What are you doing?<br> I... I ain't doing nothing, miss.<br> Well, get out. This instant!<br> Mr Allnut!<br> Mr Allnut!<br> You may come in out of the rain!<br> Thank you, miss.<br> - Oh, miss?<br> - Yes, Mr Allnut?<br> I'm sorry I gave you such a turn.<br> That's quite all right, Mr Allnut.<br> - Good night, miss.<br> - Good night, Mr Allnut.<br> - What a frightfully strong smell!<br> - What smell?<br> The river.<br> Smells like marigolds, stale ones.<br> Does, huh?<br> Not a very good smell for a flower.<br> They're very pretty,<br> though, marigolds.<br> They are, huh?<br> - Mr Allnut?<br> - Yes, miss?<br> The current's quite strong<br> here, isn't it?<br> Yes. We're getting near the rapids.<br> Really? So soon?<br> Just around that bend.<br> Kind of dangerous.<br> Better let me take over.<br> Here you are, miss.<br> - Well, miss?<br> - Yes, Mr Allnut?<br> - How'd you like it?<br> - Like it?<br> - White water rapids.<br> - I never dreamed.<br> I don't blame you for being scared,<br> not one bit.<br> Ain't nobody<br> ain't scared of white water.<br> I never dreamed a mere physical<br> experience could be so stimulating!<br> How's that?<br> I've only known such excitement<br> a few times before,<br> in my brother's sermons<br> when the spirit was really upon him.<br> - You want to go on?<br> - Naturally.<br> - Miss, you're crazy!<br> - Pardon?<br> What if we'd come against them rocks?<br> But we didn't.<br> I must say I'm filled with admiration<br> for your skill, Mr Allnut.<br> Do you suppose, after I've practised,<br> that someday I might try?<br> Miss, them rapids ain't nothing<br> to what's in front of us!<br> I wouldn't call them rapids at all.<br> - I can hardly wait.<br> - But, miss!<br> Now that I've had a taste of it,<br> I don't wonder you love boating,<br> Mr Allnut.<br> Is something the matter,<br> Mr Allnut? Tell me.<br> Nothing you'd understand.<br> I simply can't imagine.<br> It's been such a pleasant day.<br> What is it?<br> Yes, Mr Allnut?<br> All this foolish talk about<br> the Luisa, going down the river.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - We ain't doing nothing of the sort.<br> Sure we are.<br> What an absurd idea.<br> "What an absurd idea. What an absurd idea."<br> Lady, you've got 10<br> absurd ideas for my one. Ha.<br> Just why don't you want to go on,<br> Mr Allnut?<br> - The river at Shona.<br> - Shona?<br> You're darn right, Shona.<br> All it takes is one bullet<br> in the blasting gelatine<br> and we're in bits and pieces.<br> - Then we'll go by night.<br> - Oh, no, we won't.<br> Then it's the rapids.<br> Nobody in their might rind<br> would tackle the rapids at night.<br> Then we'll go in daylight<br> on the far side from Shona<br> as fast as ever we can.<br> - Oh, no, we won't.<br> - You agreed to go.<br> I never did.<br> I never agreed to nothing.<br> You are a liar, Mr Allnut,<br> and what is worse, you are a coward.<br> Woo! Coward yourself.<br> You ain't no lady. No, miss.<br> That's what my poor old mother<br> would say to you,<br> if my poor old mother<br> were to hear you.<br> Whose boat is this, anyway?<br> I asked you onboard<br> cos I was sorry for you<br> on account of you<br> losing your brother.<br> That's what you get<br> for feeling sorry for people.<br> I ain't sorry no more, you crazy,<br> psalm-singing, skinny old maid!<br> " There was a bold fisherman<br> " Set sail from off Pimlico<br> " And when he got off Pimlico<br> # The winds did begin to blow<br> " And the little boat<br> wibble-wobbled so<br> " Then overboard went he<br> " Singing twinky deedle dum<br> " Twinky deedle dee<br> " Was the highly interesting song<br> that he sung<br> " Twinky deedle dum<br> " Twinky deedle dee... "<br> Oh.<br> Oh, miss. Oh, have pity, miss.<br> Oh, you don't know<br> what you're doing, miss.<br> I'll perish without<br> a hair of the dog.<br> Oh, miss.<br> It ain't your property!<br> Ooh. Oh...<br> Oh, what a head.<br> # There was a bold fisherman<br> # Set sail from off Pimlico<br> # To catch the bold piggy<br> # And the gay macaroo<br> # But when he left Pimlico,<br> the winds... #<br> Ah, it's great to have a<br> lady aboard with clean habits.<br> Sets the man a good example.<br> A man alone,<br> he gets to living like a hog.<br> Then, too, with me,<br> it's always put things off.<br> Never do today<br> what you can put off till tomorrow.<br> But with you,<br> business before pleasure every time.<br> Do all your laundry,<br> make yourself spick-and-span,<br> get all the mending out of the way,<br> and then, and only then,<br> sit down for a nice quiet hour<br> with the good book.<br> I tell you, it's a model,<br> like an inspiration.<br> I ain't had this engine<br> so clean in years, inside and out.<br> Just look at her, miss.<br> See how she sparkles.<br> Myself, too.<br> Guess you never saw me<br> without whiskers and cleaned up.<br> I'll bet you wouldn't recognise me,<br> that much of a change.<br> Dressed up, too.<br> If I only had some<br> clean clothes like you.<br> Now, you...<br> Why, you could be at high tea.<br> Say, that's an idea, miss.<br> How's about a nice little cup of tea?<br> Don't you stir.<br> I'll be glad to make it for you.<br> Uh... how's the book, miss?<br> Not that I ain't read it.<br> My mum used to<br> read me stories out of it.<br> How's about reading it out loud?<br> I could sure do with<br> a little spiritual comfort myself.<br> And you call yourself a Christian.<br> Do you hear me? Don't you? Don't you?<br> Huh? Huh?<br> What you being so mean for, miss?<br> Man takes a drop too much once in a<br> while, it's...only human nature.<br> Nature, Mr Allnut,<br> is what we are put in this world<br> to rise above.<br> Miss...<br> I'm sorry. I apologise.<br> What more can a man do<br> than say he's sorry, huh?<br> You done paid me back, miss.<br> You didn't even leave me a drop.<br> Miss, have a heart. Fair's fair.<br> You've got to say something.<br> I don't care what it is.<br> I'll be honest with you, miss, I...<br> I just can't stand no more of this.<br> I just ain't used to it.<br> So, you think it was your<br> nasty drunkenness I minded.<br> Well, what else?<br> You promised you'd go down the river.<br> Miss, listen to me...<br> and try to understand.<br> There's death a dozen times over<br> down the river.<br> I'm sorry, but blame the Ulanga.<br> You promised.<br> Well, I'm taking my promise back!<br> All right, miss, you win,<br> as the crocodiles<br> will be glad to hear.<br> Down the river we go.<br> Have some breakfast, Mr Allnut.<br> Thanks. Don't mind if I do,<br> cos it'll be my last.<br> Oh, no. Get up steam.<br> Breakfast can wait.<br> Waiting for their supper, miss.<br> Which side of the river<br> is Shona on?<br> How's that, miss?<br> - Which bank is Shona on?<br> - Over to starboard, miss.<br> Good. Then the sun<br> will be in their eyes.<br> Huh?<br> I say the sun will be in their eyes!<br> Don't be worried, Mr Allnut.<br> Oh, I ain't worried, miss.<br> Gave myself up for dead<br> back where we started.<br> Mr Allnut.<br> Better get down, miss!<br> - What?<br> - Fire.<br> Come here. Fire on the ship.<br> Get down lower, miss!<br> Nothing to do<br> but let her drift, miss.<br> Are we going to be all right,<br> Mr Allnut?<br> Oh, yes. Everything's all right,<br> if we can keep up steam and the<br> boiler don't bust and that mend holds<br> and we don't pile up on them rocks.<br> Oh!<br> We made it! We made it!<br> Hip, hip, hooray!<br> We sure put one over on them!<br> How curious to be shot at.<br> - They didn't shoot till we passed!<br> - One isn't afraid at all.<br> They didn't believe we'd<br> go down the gorge!<br> - The bullets sound like mosquitoes.<br> - Cos who could?<br> I felt like clapping at them!<br> Well, we showed 'em!<br> Hip, hip, hooray!<br> Was my handling<br> of the boat all right?<br> Well, yes, miss.<br> It was better than all right,<br> miss.<br> Well, we're...<br> we're running short of fuel.<br> We'd better put in someplace.<br> Well, I... better do some pumping,<br> we'll be swimming pretty soon.<br> - Oh, let me do that.<br> - Oh, no, miss.<br> No, please let me,<br> while you get fuel.<br> Easy does it, miss.<br> Don't wear yourself out.<br> Picked up a thorn in my foot.<br> - It's gone right through the sole.<br> - Let me.<br> Oh, thank you, miss.<br> Do you...recognise these flowers,<br> Mr Allnut?<br> Huh?<br> I've never seen them before.<br> Well, I can't say as I have, either.<br> Perhaps no one has.<br> I don't suppose<br> they even have a name.<br> Whether they have<br> or not, they... sure are pretty.<br> Mr Allnut.<br> Dear.<br> Well... well, now.<br> This is more like it...<br> breakfast in bed.<br> Two spoonfuls of sugar is right,<br> isn't it?<br> Fancy you building a fire and all<br> while I slept.<br> Dear, what is your first name?<br> - Charlie.<br> - Charlie.<br> That's a nice name.<br> Charlie, Charlie.<br> Give us a kiss.<br> Charlie. Charlie.<br> The more I look at this place,<br> the prettier it gets.<br> I expect it's just about<br> the prettiest place I've ever been to.<br> Not that I ain't all for<br> going on down the river.<br> The sooner we blow up the Luisa,<br> the better.<br> What I meant was...<br> I'd like to come back here someday.<br> - Then you think we can do it.<br> - Of course we can.<br> Nothing a man can't do<br> if he believes in himself.<br> Never say die, that's my motto.<br> I've had misgivings.<br> as beginning to think the whole thing was a mista<br> How's that, miss, I mean, Rosie?<br> I had a moment of weakness.<br> If you're weak, a day or two here<br> won't make any difference.<br> Oh, no. We'll go on.<br> Thank heaven for your strength,<br> Charlie.<br> Oh! No!<br> Hey, Rosie. Listen.<br> We nearly done it that time.<br> - How much damage have we done?<br> - Let's get the water out and see.<br> Yeah. Better than<br> we could have hoped for.<br> Skin's tight, no water coming in.<br> What was that clattering<br> before we stopped?<br> That's what we gotta find out.<br> How are you going to do that, dear?<br> I gotta go down underneath<br> and take a look.<br> I hope there's no fancy currents<br> down there.<br> Well, here goes.<br> - Could you see anything, dear?<br> - Yeah.<br> Shaft's twisted like a corkscrew,<br> and there's a blade off the prop.<br> We'll have to mend it, then.<br> Mend it? Ha. Fat chance.<br> Oh, why is that, dear? What should<br> we have to do before we can go on?<br> I'll tell you what we could do<br> if we was back in Lubumbashi.<br> We could pull this old tub out,<br> haul the shaft to the workshop<br> and forge it straight again.<br> We could write the makers<br> for a new prop.<br> They might even have one,<br> as this boat's only 30 years old.<br> While we wait, we could<br> clean 'er bottom, paint 'er up.<br> Then we put the new shaft in<br> and the new prop and go on our way.<br> But this ain't Lubumbashi.<br> Couldn't you straighten the shaft<br> without taking the boat up on shore?<br> Uh...I don't know. I might.<br> Means working under water.<br> Could be done, maybe.<br> If you could get the shaft<br> up on shore, could you straighten it?<br> I ain't got no anvil,<br> hearth, coal, I ain't got nothin'!<br> I saw a Masai native working once<br> using charcoal on a big hollow stone.<br> He had a boy to fan the charcoal.<br> Yeah, I've seen that.<br> I'd use a bellows myself...<br> make one easy enough.<br> Well, if you think that<br> would be better.<br> There's lots and lots of firewood<br> on the bank.<br> Why don't you try it?<br> No. No, no.<br> It ain't no use, Rosie.<br> I was forgetting the prop...<br> blade's gone.<br> Can't we use the blades<br> that are left?<br> The prop would be off balance.<br> The shaft would be twisted up again.<br> We'll have to make a new blade.<br> There's lots of iron<br> and stuff that you could use.<br> Yeah. Tie it on!<br> Well, if you think<br> that would do, but...<br> wouldn't it be better to weld it on?<br> Isn't that the right word, dear?<br> Weld it on?<br> You're a one, Rosie. Really, you are.<br> But isn't "weld" the right word?<br> You know what I mean<br> even if it isn't.<br> I swallowed half the river that time.<br> You were down there<br> an awfully long time.<br> The shaft don't want to come,<br> it's stuck!<br> - Charlie.<br> - Huh?<br> - Let me help you.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - I'm going down there.<br> - Rosie, the currents are fierce!<br> I don't want a drowneded woman<br> on my hands.<br> What will you be thinking of next?<br> Well... here goes.<br> If my dad had put me to blacksmithing<br> when I was a kid,<br> I don't think I should have ever<br> come to Africa.<br> I might have...<br> but then I wouldn't have met you,<br> Rosie, old girl.<br> Charlie.<br> Well. There.<br> That's about as good<br> as I could get it.<br> Didn't take so long, neither.<br> Blade'll be different.<br> I gotta make that.<br> It turns right enough,<br> but that don't mean nothing.<br> Question is, will she stand up<br> under a full head of steam?<br> Well, we'll get the answer<br> out there.<br> The Lord help us<br> if it ain't the right one.<br> Looks like this old river got tired<br> of all the running and jumping<br> and decided to rest for a while.<br> This must be where the river changes<br> her name from Ulanga to Bora.<br> Ah, pinch me, Rosie.<br> Here we are, going down the river<br> like Antony and Cleopatra<br> on their barge.<br> If it hadn't been for you,<br> this couldn't be.<br> - Aren't you proud of yourself?<br> - Certainly not.<br> You kept the engine going.<br> You mended the propeller.<br> It wasn't me at all.<br> There's not another man alive<br> who could've done it.<br> Right you are,<br> cos no other man alive's got you.<br> I'll never forget<br> how you looked going over the falls.<br> Head up, chin out,<br> hair blowing in the wind.<br> The living picture of a heroine.<br> Fancy me a heroine.<br> Oh, Charlie.<br> You've lost your mind.<br> Lost my heart, too.<br> Should we drop the anchor,<br> sweetheart?<br> The river needs to rest for a while.<br> I suppose we do, too.<br> Rosie, soon we're gonna wish<br> we was back shooting the rapids.<br> - Ooh!<br> - Oh!<br> Ooh, this is awful.<br> We gotta get out of here.<br> We got no steam.<br> - I'm going under the water.<br> - That's it.<br> - No!<br> - But I'm being eaten alive!<br> About what you said, look at that.<br> Oh! Get me out of here.<br> I can't stand it! Oh! Ahh!<br> Ahh! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!<br> Charlie! Charlie!<br> Ohh, Charlie!<br> Oh. Oh...<br> Charlie!<br> Hurry, hurry, hurry!<br> We got away from them.<br> You can come out now.<br> I'm ashamed of myself, Charlie,<br> acting this way,<br> but I...I couldn't help it,<br> I was going mad.<br> Oh, you are so bitten.<br> The bites themselves ain't so bad,<br> it's having 'em around you.<br> I've heard of them<br> driving buffalo stark, staring mad<br> so they just run and run<br> until they fall down dead.<br> Will it be that way<br> wherever we tie up?<br> - Probably.<br> - What are we going to do, Charlie?<br> Well, if the river keeps straight,<br> deep and slow, not much can hurt us.<br> I'll let the anchor out.<br> That'll keep us out of trouble.<br> How much further do you suppose it is<br> to the lake, Charlie?<br> Not so many miles as the crow flies.<br> No telling how many days.<br> All depends on how much<br> winding around this old river does.<br> Ah...what a time we've had, Rosie.<br> What a time.<br> We'll never lack for stories<br> to tell our grandchildren, will we?<br> Nothing but grass and papyrus<br> as far as you can see.<br> - Which is the main channel?<br> - Don't look like there is one.<br> - What are we going to do, Charlie?<br> - I don't know.<br> We can't just go round and round<br> here forever.<br> Can't just go round and round.<br> We get in and the grass<br> closes in back of the stern,<br> there's no going back, Rosie.<br> Anything happens, we just sit there<br> till we go off our heads with fever.<br> - I know it.<br> - All right.<br> You pays your money<br> and you takes your choice.<br> That way.<br> Pull her over.<br> We've come along by steam,<br> we've paddled and pushed<br> and pulled this old boat<br> along with a hook.<br> What we ain't done up to now<br> is get out and carry her.<br> Looks like that'll come next.<br> It's hard to breathe,<br> the air is so heavy.<br> Can't tell it from the water.<br> Or the water from the land,<br> for that matter.<br> All the channels we've lost,<br> all the twisting and turning<br> we've done.<br> We may come out where we started,<br> if we come out at all.<br> We've always followed the current.<br> That don't mean<br> nothing to this river!<br> This river's crazy...<br> crazy as I am!<br> Charlie. Charlie.<br> Sorry, old girl.<br> Well...<br> Only thing to put the roses<br> back in our cheeks<br> is to get out of these reeds.<br> What I said about having to get out<br> and carry this old boat<br> was meant to be a joke.<br> Don't look like a joke now. Well...<br> Ahh!<br> Ooh!<br> Ooh!<br> Ooh, the little beggars!<br> Ooh, ooh. Pull them off me.<br> No! If the heads stay in,<br> they'll poison your blood.<br> Salt. Salt, salt.<br> Eww.<br> Oh, if there's anything in the world<br> I hate, it's leeches!<br> The filthy little devils.<br> There. There, dear. There.<br> Fine specimen of a man<br> I am, ain't I?<br> You're the bravest man<br> that ever lived.<br> You just overdo, that's all.<br> What you need is a few hours sleep.<br> There.<br> Now, are you all comfortable?<br> Go to sleep, dear.<br> And when you wake up,<br> we'll be on our way again.<br> - Rosie...<br> - Yes, Charlie?<br> You want the truth, don't you?<br> Even if we had all our strength,<br> we'll never get her off this mud.<br> - We're finished.<br> - I know it.<br> But, Rosie...<br> I'm not one bit sorry I came.<br> What I mean is...<br> it was worth it.<br> Dear Lord...<br> we've come to the end of our journey.<br> In a little while,<br> we will stand before you.<br> I pray for you to be merciful.<br> Judge us not<br> for our weakness but for our love,<br> and open the doors of heaven<br> for Charlie and me.<br> Rosie.<br> Rosie.<br> Rosie. Rosie, dear.<br> Look. We're on the lake.<br> The rain did it...<br> just lifted the old Queen up<br> and carried her over the mud.<br> We couldn't have been a 100 yards<br> from it last night.<br> Look, Rosie.<br> Let's build a fire<br> and get the engine started<br> and get into the middle<br> where we can breathe.<br> Sure, sure.<br> We'll be out of here in a jiffy.<br> This air...<br> - isn't it wonderful?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's like... You don't approve,<br> but it's like a shot of gin.<br> Makes your blood race,<br> your face numb and your spirits soar.<br> I'm sorry I poured that gin out,<br> Charlie.<br> Aw, forget it, Rosie.<br> To show there's no hard feelings,<br> I'll make you another cup of tea.<br> You carry on more over a cup of tea<br> than I do over a glass of gin.<br> Is it?<br> It's the Luisa<br> and she's coming right at us.<br> She must be doing 12 knots.<br> We've gotta make a run for it<br> back to the reeds.<br> She's coming right toward us.<br> I thought for a minute<br> they'd seen us.<br> They're going toward that island.<br> Probably anchor there tonight<br> and leave in the morning.<br> Don't worry. They'll be back again.<br> You know how the Germans are.<br> They lays down systems<br> and sticks to them.<br> Mondays they're one place,<br> Tuesday someplace else<br> and Wednesday they'll be back here.<br> How long will it take<br> to get the torpedoes ready?<br> I don't know.<br> It depends on the detonators.<br> Gotta devise something.<br> I know what you're thinking, Rosie.<br> You're thinking of<br> taking the Queen out at night<br> when the Luisa comes back, ain't you?<br> Well, we ought to manage it.<br> There. That ought to work.<br> When we ram her, these nails will<br> shoot the bullets into the gelatine.<br> Charlie, you're wonderful.<br> Can't put them in the cylinders yet.<br> We'll do that when<br> we're ready to start.<br> It'll be dark by then.<br> Can you do it in the dark?<br> It's a case of have to.<br> You're sure they'll come back<br> with the Luisa?<br> Mm-hmm. Dead sure.<br> The lake's 100 miles long,<br> Luisa does about...<br> uh, about 12 knots.<br> That's 120 miles a day. Yup.<br> She'll be back here tomorrow.<br> When she comes,<br> we'll be ready for her.<br> Charlie, let's make the Queen<br> as clean as we can.<br> Scrub her decks and polish her brass.<br> Sure. She ought to look her best<br> representing the Royal Navy.<br> - You know, Rosie, I been thinking.<br> - Yes, Charlie?<br> There ain't no use in<br> us both going to do it.<br> - Now I see it's a one-man job.<br> - You couldn't be more right, dear.<br> So when the time comes, I'll put you<br> off on the east shore.<br> You'll wait while I attend<br> to the Luisa.<br> - You're the one to be put ashore.<br> - Me?<br> This was my idea.<br> I'm the one to carry it out.<br> Why, Rosie, I'm surprised!<br> You're a sensible woman.<br> We won't have any more talk<br> like that.<br> I can manage this boat<br> as well as you, and you know it.<br> Rosie, you're cracked!<br> Didn't I steer going down the rapids?<br> But you don't know about the engine.<br> Suppose she broke down on you.<br> Me, I'd walk back and do<br> a thing or two to that engine...<br> spit on her, kick her,<br> and she'd go right to work.<br> - Oh, she knows who's boss.<br> - I suppose you're right.<br> Well, now, that's all settled.<br> I'll dive off just before the crash,<br> swim to shore,<br> and we'll be off to Kenya.<br> I meant it may be necessary<br> for you to come along.<br> Didn't we just agree<br> this was a one-man job?<br> But you convinced me<br> that it isn't, so it's settled.<br> - We'll go together.<br> - Oh, no we won't.<br> You'll wait for me<br> on the east shore.<br> Who do you think you are,<br> ordering me about?<br> I'm the captain, and you ain't going.<br> You'd only be in my way.<br> I suppose I was in your way<br> going down the rapids.<br> Then what you said<br> back there was a lie,<br> about how you couldn't<br> have done it alone<br> and how you'd<br> lost your heart and... everything.<br> You liar!<br> Oh, Charlie,<br> we're having our first quarrel.<br> Oh, Rosie, it's only that<br> I just can't bear the thought of...<br> What I mean is,<br> suppose something should happen...<br> - not that anything will, but...<br> - Don't you understand, Charlie?<br> I wouldn't want to go on to Kenya<br> without you.<br> Oh, Rosie. All right.<br> It'll be you at the tiller<br> and me at the engine,<br> just like it was from the start.<br> And there's the Luisa, right on time.<br> Blowing up a bit.<br> Better get started. All right?<br> Charlie! Charlie, I can't steer!<br> It's hard to steer.<br> Too much water in the bow.<br> Moves out of the water<br> half the time.<br> Gotta get her nose up<br> or it's trouble!<br> Rosie, we're sinking.<br> Rosie! Rosie!<br> Rosie! Rosie!<br> Rosie!<br> What is your nationality?<br> - French? Belgian?

Charlie...<br> - Stop that.<br> - Order.<br> Are they going<br> to hang you, Charlie?<br> Frulein Sayer,<br> you will answer the question.<br> Very well. Ask your questions.<br> Why were you on the lake?<br> We came to sink this ship,<br> and we would have except...<br> Let's at least have the pleasure<br> of telling them.<br> Don't believe her. She's touched.<br> Stop that, Charlie.<br> I'm certainly not<br> going to outlive you.<br> And just how, Frulein,<br> did you propose to sink the Luisa?<br> With torpedoes.<br> - Torpedoes?<br> - Nein.<br> Will you be so good as to tell us<br> exactly where and how<br> you acquired torpedoes?<br> - Mr Allnut made them.<br> - How very interesting.<br> You don't believe me, do you?<br> Charlie, tell them how<br> you made the torpedoes.<br> Well, well, I...<br> See, I took the heads off<br> two cylinders of oxygen,<br> and filled them with live explosive.<br> That was easy enough.<br> The detonators took some doing.<br> You know what I used? Cartridges<br> and nails and blocks of soft wood.<br> Then I put the two cylinders<br> in the bows of the African Queen,<br> near the water line.<br> When we rammed you, poof!<br> Where is the African Queen?<br> She sank in the storm.<br> How did you get onto the lake?<br> We came down the Ulanga.<br> The Bora, you call it here.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - Nevertheless.<br> But the river's unnavigable.<br> That may be.<br> We came down it, though,<br> didn't we? And in the African Queen.<br> Would you hang us together, please?<br> - Noose.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Hey, Captain...<br> - Yes?<br> - Will you grant us a last request?<br> - What is it?<br> - Marry us.<br> - Was?<br> We want to get married.<br> Ship captains can do that, right?<br> -Ja!<br> Why, Charlie, what a lovely idea.<br> What kind of craziness is this?<br> Come on, Captain.<br> It'll only take a minute.<br> It'll mean such a lot to the lady.<br> Very well,<br> if you wish it absolutely.<br> What are the names again?<br> - Charles.<br> - Rosie. Rose.<br> Do you, Charles, take this woman<br> to be your lawful wedded wife?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Do you, Rose, take this man<br> to be your lawful wedded husband?<br> I do.<br> By the authority vested in me<br> by Kaiser Wilhelm Il,<br> I pronounce you man and wife.<br> Proceed with the execution.<br> - Hey, what happened?<br> - We did it, Charlie! We did it!<br> But how?<br> Well, what do you think?<br> You all right, Mrs Allnut?<br> Wonderful.<br> Simply wonderful.<br> And you, Mr Allnut?<br> Pretty good...<br> for an old married man.<br> I'm all twisted around, Charlie.<br> Which way is the east shore?<br> The way we're swimming, old girl!<br> # There was bold fisherman<br> # Set sail from off Pimlico<br> # To catch the bold piggy<br> and the gay macaroo<br> # But when he got off Pimlico<br> # The wind, it began to blow... #<br>
