"<br> And, again as usual,|rose at the end of the third act...<br> ...and disappeared.<br> New York then knew|that a half-hour later...<br> ...the Beauforts' annual|opera ball would begin.<br> Carriages waited at the curb|for the entire performance.<br> It was known in New York|but never acknowledged...<br> ...that Americans want|to leave amusement...<br> ...even more quickly|than they want to get to it.<br> The Beauforts' house was one of|the few in New York with a ballroom.<br> Such a room, shuttered in darkness|364 days of the year...<br> ...was felt to compensate for whatever|was regrettable in the Beaufort past.<br> Regina Beaufort came from|an old South Carolina family.<br> But her husband, Julius,|who passed for an Englishman...<br> ...was known to have dissipated|habits, a bitter tongue...<br> ...and mysterious antecedents.<br> His marriage assured him|a social position...<br> ...but not necessarily respect.<br> Newland Archer hadn't stopped at|his club, as young men usually did...<br> ...but came directly to the ball.<br> He wanted the announcement|of his engagement...<br> ...to divert gossip away|from the countess...<br> ...and show his most ardent support|for May and her whole family.<br> The Beaufort house had been|boldly planned.<br> Instead of squeezing through|a passage to get to the ballroom...<br> ...one marched solemnly down a vista|of enfiladed drawing rooms.<br> But only by passing through|the crimson drawing room...<br> ...could one see|The Return of Spring...<br> ...the much-discussed nude|by Bouguereau...<br> Archer enjoyed such challenges|to convention.<br> He questioned conformity in private...<br> ...but in public he upheld|family and tradition.<br> This was a world balanced|so precariously...<br> ...that its harmony could be|shattered by a whisper.<br> On the whole, Archer was amused by|the smooth hypocrisies of his peers.<br> He may even have envied them.<br> Lawrence Lefferts, for instance...<br> ...was New York's foremost|authority on form.<br> His opinion on pumps|versus patent-leather oxfords...<br> ...had never been disputed.<br> On matters of surreptitious romance...<br> ...his skills went unquestioned.<br> Old Mr. Sillerton Jackson was|as great an authority on family...<br> ...as Lawrence Lefferts was on form.<br> The mean and melancholy history of|Countess Olenska's European marriage...<br> ...was a buried treasure|he hastened to excavate.<br> He carried, like a calling card...<br> ...an entire register|of the scandals and mysteries...<br> ...that had smoldered under|the unruffled surface of society...<br> ...for the last 50 years.<br> Now, Julius Beaufort's secret|was the way he carried things off.<br> He could arrive casually at his|party as if he were another guest...<br> ...and might leave early...<br> ...for a more modest but comforting|address in the East 30s.<br> He was intrepid in his business...<br> ...but in his personal affairs,|absolutely audacious.<br> Archer's fiancee was innocent of all|these intrigues and of much else.<br> May Welland represented for Archer|all that was best in their world...<br> ...all that he honored.|And she anchored him to it.<br> I've told my friends,|just as you asked.<br> I couldn't wait.<br> - I wish it hadn't been at a ball.|- But even here we're alone.<br> The worst of it is that|I want to kiss you and I can't.<br> Did you tell Ellen as I asked you to?<br> I didn't have a chance after all.<br> She's my cousin.|If others know before she does....<br> She's been away for so long.|She's rather sensitive.<br> I'll tell her.|But I didn't see her yet.<br> - She didn't come at the last minute.|- At the last minute?<br> She thought her dress|wasn't smart enough.<br> We thought it was lovely,|but she asked to be taken home.<br> Oh, well.<br> Very handsome.<br> Very liberal.<br> In my time, a cameo set in pearls|was thought to be sufficient.<br> But it's the hand that sets off|the ring, isn't it?<br> The setting shows|the stone beautifully.<br> But it looks bare|to old-fashioned eyes.<br> I hope you don't mean mine, my dear.|I like all the novelties.<br> My hands were modeled in Paris by|the great Rochet. He should do May's.<br> Show me, child.<br> Her hand is so tempered.<br> These modern sports spread the joints.<br> But the skin is white.<br> When's the wedding?<br> Soon, if only you'll back me up,|Mrs. Mingott.<br> We must give them time|to know each other better.<br> Know each other?<br> Everyone in New York|has always known everyone.<br> Don't wait till the bubble's off|the wine. Marry before Lent.<br> I may catch pneumonia, and I want|to give the wedding breakfast.<br> What a kind offer.<br> Even if she hadn't been|May's grandmother...<br> ...Mrs. Manson Mingott would|have been the first to receive...<br> ...the required betrothal visit.<br> She was not only the matriarch|of this world...<br> ...she was nearly its dowager empress.<br> Much of New York was related to her...<br> ...and she knew the remainder|by marriage or by reputation.<br> Though brownstone was the norm...<br> ...she lived magisterially|within a large house...<br> ...of controversial pale,|cream-colored stone...<br> ...in an inaccessible wilderness|near the Central Park.<br> The burden of her flesh|had long since made it impossible...<br> ...for her to climb stairs.<br> So with characteristic|independence...<br> ...she had established herself|on the ground floor of her house.<br> From her sitting room, there was|an unexpected vista of her bedroom.<br> Her visitors were fascinated by|the foreignness of this arrangement...<br> ...which recalled scenes|in French fiction.<br> This was how women with lovers|lived in the wicked old societies.<br> But if she had wanted a lover...<br> ...the intrepid woman|would have had him too.<br> For now, she was content simply...<br> ...and to anticipate eagerly|the union of Newland Archer...<br> ...with her granddaughter, May.<br> In them, two of New York's|best families...<br> ...would finally|and momentously be joined.<br> - Goodbye, Mama.|- Goodbye.<br> Ellen.<br> Beaufort, this is a rare favor.<br> Unnecessarily rare, I'd say.<br> I met Countess Ellen,|and she let me walk home with her.<br> This house will be merrier|now that she's here.<br> - Thank you.|- Beaufort, pull up that tuffet.<br> I want a good gossip.<br> You already know about May and me.<br> She scolded me for not telling you.<br> Of course I know, and I'm so glad.<br> One doesn't tell such news|first in a crowd.<br> Careful there.<br> Don't catch your ring on your sleeve.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> Come and see me someday.<br> It's a mistake for Ellen to parade up|5th Avenue with Julius...<br> ...at the crowded hour...<br> ...the very day after her arrival.<br> He's so flagrant. Even his wife|must know about Annie Ring.<br> Sillerton Jackson enjoyed his|frequent visits to the Archer home...<br> ...more than the actual dining.<br> Newland Archer's mother...<br> ...and his sister Janey were both|shy women and shrank from society.<br> But they liked to be well-informed|and doted on their bachelor friend.<br> Certain nuances escape Beaufort.<br> Necessarily.|Beaufort is a vulgar man.<br> Not in business. Most of New York|trusts him with its affairs.<br> My Grandfather Newland|always told Mother:<br> "Don't let that Beaufort|be introduced to the girls."<br> At least he's had the advantage|of association with gentlemen.<br> The Archers and the Mingotts|were the sturdiest branches...<br> ...of New York's tangled family tree.<br> Granny Mingott's family could|embrace May's traditionalism...<br> ...and tolerate Ellen's|unconventionality.<br> But Archer's family held fast|to the old ways.<br> His mother and sister relied|on him for every security.<br> He would always be,|Mrs. Archer assured May's mother:<br> "Their strong right hand. "<br> Was our new cousin at the ball?<br> I appreciate the Mingotts' support|of her, having her at the opera.<br> I admire their esprit de corps.<br> But why my son's engagement...<br> ...should be mixed up with her comings|and goings, I don't see.<br> In any case, she was not at the ball.<br> At least she had that decency.<br> Does she wear a round hat|or a bonnet in the afternoon?<br> The dress she wore|to the opera was so plain.<br> - It was in better taste not to go.|- It wasn't taste.<br> May said Ellen decided|her dress wasn't smart enough.<br> Poor Ellen.<br> We must always remember|the eccentric bringing-up she had.<br> What can you expect of a girl who wore|black satin at her coming-out ball?<br> It's odd she kept such an ugly name|as Ellen when she married the count.<br> I'd have changed it to Elaine.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> It sounds more...<br> ...Polish.<br> It sounds more conspicuous.|That can hardly be what she wishes.<br> Why shouldn't she be conspicuous|if she chooses?<br> She made an awful marriage,|but should she hide her head?<br> Should she slink around|as if she disgraced herself?<br> She's had a sad life.|That doesn't make her an outcast.<br> I'm sure that's the line|the Mingotts mean to take.<br> I needn't wait for their cue,|if that's what you mean.<br> I'm told she's looking for a house.|She intends to live here.<br> I hear she means to get a divorce.<br> I hope she will.<br> Understandably, her marriage|was intolerable.<br> - There are the rumors too.|- I've heard them.<br> The secretary.<br> He helped get her away|from the husband.<br> They say the count kept her|practically a prisoner.<br> Certainly the count|had his own way of life.<br> - You knew him?|- I heard of him at Nice.<br> Handsome, they say...<br> ...but eyes with a lot of lashes.<br> When he wasn't with women...<br> ...he was collecting china.<br> Paying any price for both,|I understand.<br> Then where's the blame?<br> Any one of us would have helped the|countess, just as the secretary did.<br> He was still helping her a year later.<br> Somebody met them|living together at Lausanne.<br> Living together?<br> Why not? She has the right|to make her life over.<br> Why bury a woman alive|if her husband prefers whores?<br> It's hardly a question of entombment.<br> The countess is here, after all.<br> Or do you believe a woman|should share the same freedoms as men?<br> I suppose I do. Yes, I do.<br> Apparently Count Olenski|takes a similarly modern view.<br> I never heard of him lifting a finger|to get his wife back.<br> Three days later,|the unthinkable happened.<br> Mrs. Manson Mingott|sent out invitations...<br> ...summoning everyone|to a formal dinner.<br> Such an occasion demanded|the most careful consideration.<br> It required the appropriate plate.<br> It called for three extra footmen...<br> ...two dishes for each course|and a Roman punch in the middle.<br> The dinner, read the invitation...<br> ...was "to meet the Countess Olenska. "<br> And New York declined.<br> "Regret, unable to accept. "<br> And from our own family.<br> No one cares enough...<br> They all lived in a kind of|hieroglyphic world.<br> The real thing was never said|or done or even thought...<br> ...but only represented|by a set of arbitrary signs.<br> Archer knew these signs. They were|not subtle and were not meant to be.<br> They were more than a simple snubbing.<br> They were an eradication.<br> There was a single court of appeal.<br> He would plead their case|before the van der Luydens.<br> And all this, you think, is due|to some intentional interference by--<br> Larry Lefferts. I'm certain of it.<br> The van der Luydens dwelled|above all the cities' families...<br> ...in a kind of|super terrestrial twilight.<br> Archer appealed to their exquisitely|refined sense of tribal order.<br> And he spoke plainly.<br> Whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins|to suspect her husband of something...<br> ...Larry makes some great diversionary|fuss to show how moral he is.<br> It's the principle that I dislike.<br> I mean, if a member of a well-known|family is backed by that family...<br> ...it should be considered final.<br> We felt this slight on the countess|shouldn't pass without consulting you.<br> We're giving a dinner for our cousin,|the Duke of St. Austrey...<br> ...who arrives next week|on the Russia.<br> I'm sure Louisa will be|as glad as I am...<br> ...if Countess Olenska will let us|include her among our guests.<br> The occasion was a solemn one.<br> But the countess arrived|rather late...<br> ...signaling a carelessness|of which she was entirely unaware.<br> She entered, without haste|or embarrassment...<br> ...the drawing room in which|New York's most chosen company...<br> ...was somewhat awfully assembled.<br> Countess Olenska.<br> Good evening.<br> We're delighted you're here.<br> The Duke of St. Austrey.|May I present Countess Olenska.<br> The Trevenna George ll plate was out.<br> So was the van der Luyden Lowestoft|from the East India Company...<br> ...and the Dagonet Crown Derby.<br> Dining with the van der Luydens|was, at best, no light matter.<br> Dining there with a duke|who was their cousin...<br> ...was almost a religious solemnity.<br> When the van der Luyden's chose,|they knew how to give a lesson.<br> Excuse me.<br> It was not the custom in New York...<br> ...for a lady to get up|and walk away from one gentleman...<br> ...in order to seek|the company of another.<br> But the countess|did not observe this rule.<br> I want you to talk to me about May.<br> You knew the duke before?<br> From Nice.<br> We saw him every winter. He's fond of|gambling and came to our house often.<br> He wears the same suit every evening.|He thinks it brings him luck.<br> He's the dullest man I ever met.<br> But he seems to be admired here.<br> May I tell you what most|interests me about New York?<br> Not all the blind obeying|of somebody else's tradition.<br> It seems stupid to make America|a copy of another country.<br> Would Columbus have taken such trouble|just to go to the opera with Lefferts?<br> If he'd known Larry Lefferts were|here, he might never have left port.<br> And May? Does she share these views?<br> If she does, she'd never say so.<br> Are you very much in love with her?<br> As much as a man can be.<br> Do you think there's a limit?<br> If there is, I haven't found it.<br> It's really and truly a romance then.<br> Not in the least arranged?<br> In our country, we don't allow|our marriages to be arranged.<br> Yes, I forgot. I'm sorry.<br> I sometimes make these mistakes.<br> I don't always remember|that everything here is good...<br> ...that was bad where I came from.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> But you know you are|among friends here.<br> Yes, I know. That's why I came home.<br> You'll want to be with May.<br> She's already surrounded|by so many rivals.<br> Then stay with me a little longer.<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Urban Dagonet,|the Countess Olenska.<br> - How do you do, my dear?|- How do you do?<br> Tomorrow then, after 5,|I'll expect you.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Excuse me.<br> It was good of you|to devote yourself...<br> ...to Madame Olenska|so unselfishly, dear Newland.<br> I told Henry|he really must rescue you.<br> I think I've never seen May|looking lovelier.<br> The duke thinks her|the handsomest woman in the room.<br> Mr. Archer.<br> So how do you like|this odd little house?<br> To me, it's like heaven.<br> You've arranged it delightfully.<br> Some of the things|I managed to bring with me.<br> Little pieces of wreckage.<br> At least it's less gloomy|than the van der Luydens'...<br> ...and not so difficult to be alone.<br> I'm sure it's often thought|the van der Luydens' is gloomy...<br> ...though I've never|heard it said before.<br> Do you really like to be alone?<br> As long as my friends keep me|from being lonely.<br> I see you've already chosen|your corner.<br> - Please, sit.|- Thank you.<br> This is the hour I like best.<br> Don't you?<br> I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour.<br> I'm sure Beaufort|can be very intriguing.<br> He took me to see some houses.<br> I'm told I must move, even though this|street seems perfectly respectable.<br> - Yes, but it's not fashionable.|- Fashionable?<br> Is fashion such|a serious consideration?<br> Among people with nothing|more serious to consider.<br> Perhaps I've been too independent.<br> All I really want is to feel|cared for and safe.<br> The van der Luydens|do nothing by halves.<br> All New York laid itself out|for you last night.<br> It was so kind. Such a nice party.<br> Cream or lemon?<br> Lemon, please.<br> The van der Luydens are the most|powerful influence in society.<br> They very seldom receive because|of Cousin Louisa's health.<br> - Perhaps that's the reason then.|- Thank you. The reason?<br> For their influence.|They make themselves so rare.<br> But of course you must tell me.<br> No, it's you telling me.<br> Then we can both help each other.<br> But I need help so much more.<br> There are so many people already...<br> ...to tell you what to do.<br> I think they're all a little angry|with me for setting up for myself.<br> Still, your family can advise you,|show you the way.<br> Is New York such a labyrinth?<br> I thought it was all straight|up and down, like 5th Avenue.<br> All the cross streets numbered...<br> ...and big honest labels|on everything.<br> Everything is labeled...<br> ...but everybody is not.<br> I must count on you for warnings too.<br> All the older women like you.|They want to help.<br> I know. As long as they don't hear|anything unpleasant.<br> Does no one here want|to know the truth, Mr. Archer?<br> The real loneliness is living|among all these kind people...<br> ...who only ask you to pretend.<br> No, you mustn't.<br> Madame Olenska.<br> Ellen....<br> Does no one cry here, either?<br> I suppose there's no need to.<br> Oh, Mr. Archer, good evening.<br> We didn't see you and weren't|sure whether to send Miss Welland--<br> Lilies of the valley.|Let's make it a standing order.<br> Very good, sir.<br> And those yellow roses.|I'll give you another address.<br> Very good.<br> - They'll go at once?|- At once.<br> It's wonderful to wake|with lilies of the valley.<br> It's like being with you.<br> They came late yesterday, I know.|Time got away from me.<br> But still, you always remember.<br> I sent roses to Ellen too.|Was that right?<br> Very right.<br> She didn't mention it|at lunch today, though.<br> ...and a hamper of carnations|from Henry van der Luyden.<br> She was so very delighted.|Don't people send flowers in Europe?<br> - I know you consider it a long time.|- Very long.<br> But the Chivers were engaged for a|year and a half, the Lefferts for two.<br> Mama expects something customary.<br> Since you were little, you've had|your way. You're almost 22.<br> Just tell your mother what you want.<br> I can't refuse her the last thing|she'd ask of me.<br> Can't we just strike out|for ourselves?<br> Shall we elope?<br> If you would, why not?<br> You do love me, Newland.|I'm so happy.<br> Well, why not be happier?<br> I couldn't be happier, dearest.<br> I showed Ellen the ring. She thought|it was the most beautiful setting.<br> She said there was nothing like it|in the Rue de la Paix.<br> I do love you, Newland.<br> Everything you do is so special.<br> I want to call on your legal skills|for a rather delicate matter.<br> Countess Olenska wants|to divorce her husband.<br> It's been suggested|she means to marry again...<br> ...although she denies it.<br> I beg your pardon,|but because of my engagement...<br> ...perhaps another member|of the firm could consider this.<br> Precisely because of your|prospective alliance...<br> ...and considering members|of the family asked for you...<br> ...I'd like you to consider it.<br> It's a family matter. Perhaps it's|best settled by the family.<br> Their position is clear.<br> They're entirely and rightly|against a divorce.<br> But Countess Olenska|still insists on a legal opinion.<br> But, really, what's the use|of a divorce?<br> She's here.<br> He's there.<br> The whole Atlantic's between them.<br> As things go,|Olenski's acted generously.<br> He's returned some of the money|without being asked.<br> She'll never get|a dollar more than that.<br> Although I understand she attaches|no importance to the money.<br> Considering all that, the wisest thing|is to do as the family say.<br> Just let well enough alone.<br> I think that's for her to decide.<br> Have you considered the consequences|if the countess decides for divorce?<br> - Consequences for the countess?|- For everyone.<br> I don't think the count's accusations|are anything more than vague charges.<br> It will make for some talk.<br> I've heard talk about the countess|and the secretary...<br> ...even before I read|the legal papers.<br> It's certain to be unpleasant.<br> Unpleasant?<br> Divorce is always unpleasant,|don't you agree?<br> Naturally.<br> Then I can count on you?<br> The family can count on you to use|your influence against a divorce?<br> I can't promise that.|Not until I've talked to the countess.<br> I don't understand you.<br> You want to marry into a family|with a divorce hanging over it?<br> I don't think that has anything|to do with the case.<br> Can someone take this to the countess?<br> You refuse such an invitation|on threat of death.<br> Is it so bad?<br> Not if you have a taste|for slow agony.<br> - I've neglected to cultivate that.|- Three days with the van der Luydens!<br> - Take your fur and a hot-water bottle.|- Is the house that cold?<br> - No, but Louisa is.|- Mr. Archer.<br> Come to Delmonico's on Sunday. I'm|having an oyster supper in your honor.<br> Private room, congenial company,|artists and so on.<br> That's tempting. I haven't met|a single artist since my arrival.<br> I know some painters I could|bring to see you.<br> Painters? Are there|any painters in New York?<br> Thank you, but I was really thinking|of singers, actors, musicians...<br> ...dramatic artists.<br> There were always so many|at my husband's house.<br> May I let you know tomorrow?|It's too late to decide tonight.<br> Is this late?<br> Of course, Newland...<br> ...if you can persuade the countess|to change her mind...<br> ...you can join us too.<br> You know painters, then?|You live in their milieu?<br> - Not exactly.|- But you care about such things?<br> Immensely. When I'm in Europe,|I never miss an exhibition.<br> I try to keep up.<br> I used to care immensely too.<br> My life was full of such things.<br> But now I want to cast off all|my old life to be an American...<br> ...and be like everyone else.<br> I doubt you'll ever quite|be like everybody else.<br> Don't say that. I want to put|all the old things behind me.<br> I know.<br> Mr. Letterblair told me.<br> Mr. Letterblair?<br> Yes, I've come because he|asked me to. I'm in the firm.<br> You mean it'll be you who'll|manage everything for me?<br> - I can talk to you. That's easier.|- Yes, I'm here to talk about it.<br> I've read all the legal papers.<br> And the letter from the count.<br> It was vile.<br> But if he chooses to fight,|he can say things that might be un--<br> That are disagreeable to you.|Say them publicly...<br> ...so that they could be|damaging even if--<br> If...?<br> Even if they were unfounded.<br> What harm could accusations|like that do me here?<br> Perhaps more harm than anywhere else.<br> Our legislation favors divorce,|but our social customs don't.<br> Well, not if the woman...<br> ...has appearances...<br> ...in the least degree against her,|has exposed herself...<br> ...by any unconventional behavior...<br> ...to offensive insinuations and....<br> Yes. So my family tell me.<br> Our family. You'll be my cousin soon.<br> And you agree with them?<br> What could you possibly gain|that would make up for the scandal?<br> My freedom.<br> But aren't you free already?<br> It's my business to help you|see these things...<br> ...the way people who|are fondest of you see them.<br> If I didn't show you how they judge|such matters, it wouldn't be fair.<br> No, it wouldn't be fair.<br> Very well.<br> I'll do as you wish.<br> I do want to help you.<br> You do help me.<br> Good night, cousin.<br> For mercy's sake,|don't cry so bitterly.<br> - Forget what I've done!|- On one condition.<br> I accept it, whatever it may be.<br> Never speak a word of love|to me again.<br> Never!<br> On my honor.<br> Heaven bless you.<br> Farewell.<br> It's fascinating.<br> Every season, same play, same scene,|same effect on the audience.<br> Remarkable, isn't it?<br> I'm enjoying this more than in London.<br> Do you see this play when you travel?|I'd travel to get away from it.<br> - Was it a dinner?|- A reception at Mrs. Struthers'...<br> ...given on the Lord's day...<br> ...but with champagne|and singing from the tabletops.<br> People say there was dancing.<br> It was a French Sunday then?<br> Dissipation can be wonderfully|energizing in the early stages....<br> Do you think her lover will send her a|box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?<br> I was thinking about that too.<br> The farewell scene.<br> Yes, I know.<br> It touches me as well.<br> I usually leave after that scene,|to take the picture away with me.<br> They always spend the winter there,|on account of her mother's bronchitis.<br> And what do you do while May is away?<br> I do my work.<br> I do want you to know|what you advised me was right.<br> Things can be so difficult sometimes...<br> ...and I'm so grateful.<br> The next day, Newland Archer searched|the city in vain for yellow roses.<br> He sent a note to Madame Olenska...<br> ...asking to call that afternoon|and requesting a reply by messenger.<br> There was no reply that day|or the next.<br> And when yellow roses|were again available...<br> ...Archer passed them by.<br> It was only on the third day|that he heard from her by post...<br> ...from the van der Luydens' home.<br> "Newland, I ran away the day after|I saw you at the play...<br> ...and these kind friends took me in.<br> I wanted to be quiet|and think things over.<br> I feel so safe here.|I wish that you were with us.<br> Yours sincerely."<br> He had received an invitation from the|Lefferts for a weekend on the Hudson.<br> He hoped it was not too late to reply.<br> Their house was not far|from the van der Luydens'.<br> I came to see what you ran away from.<br> - I knew you'd come.|- That shows you wanted me to.<br> May wrote she asked you|to take care of me.<br> - I didn't need to be asked.|- Why?<br> Am I so helpless and defenseless?<br> Or are women here so blessed|they never feel need?<br> What sort of need?<br> Oh, please, don't ask me.|I don't speak your language.<br> Henry left the patroon house open|for me. I want you to see it.<br> When you wrote me, you were unhappy.<br> Yes, but I can't feel unhappy|when you're here.<br> I shan't be here long.<br> I know.<br> ...if I'm really to help you...<br> ...you must tell me|what you're running from.<br> Is he what you're running from?<br> Or what you expected?<br> I didn't know he was here.<br> Hello, Beaufort.<br> This way. Madame Olenska|was expecting you.<br> All this way just to tell you I've|found the perfect house for you.<br> It's not on the market yet,|so you must take it now.<br> Well, Archer.

Ellen.<br> - Has anything happened?|- Yes.<br> I found I had to see you.<br> What is it?<br> Nothing.<br> Tell me what you do all day.<br> ...from Philadelphia and Baltimore|picnicking at the inn.<br> And the Merrys are setting up|a lawn tennis court...<br> ...but nobody here has really|heard of the game yet, so....<br> I have my racket|and so does Kate Merry....<br> I came here because I thought I could|persuade you to break away from that.<br> To advance our engagement.<br> Don't you understand how much|I want to marry you?<br> Why should we dream away another year?<br> I'm not sure I do understand.<br> Are you not certain of feeling|the same way about me?<br> What on earth do you mean?<br> Is there someone else?<br> Someone else?<br> Between you and me?<br> Let's talk frankly, Newland.<br> I've felt a difference in you,|especially since our engagement.<br> - What?|- If it's untrue, it won't hurt to talk.<br> And if it is true, we should talk.|You might've made a mistake.<br> If I'd made a mistake, would I be|asking to hurry our marriage?<br> I don't know. You might.<br> It'd be one way to settle|the question.<br> In Newport, two years ago...<br> ...before we were promised...<br> ...everyone said there|was someone else for you.<br> I saw you with her, sitting together|on a veranda at a dance.<br> When she came into the house,|her face looked so sad...<br> ...I felt sorry for her.|Even after, when we were engaged...<br> ...I could still see how she looked--<br> Is that all you've been|concerned about?<br> It's long past.<br> Then is there something else?<br> No.<br> Of course not.<br> Whatever it may have been...<br> ...I can't have my happiness made out|of a wrong to someone else.<br> If promises were made, or if|you feel pledged to this person...<br> ...even if it means her divorce,|don't give her up because of me.<br> There are no pledges.<br> There are no promises that matter.<br> That's all I've been trying to say.|There is no one between us, May.<br> Which is precisely my argument|for getting married...<br> ...quickly.<br> He could feel her dropping back|to inexpressive girlishness.<br> Her conscience had been|eased of its burden.<br> "It was wonderful, " he thought...<br> ...

Here?|No, of course not.<br> He sent someone.<br> His secretary?<br> Yes.<br> He's still here. He insisted on...<br> ...waiting in case I changed my mind.<br> You haven't changed, Newland.<br> I had changed until I saw you again.<br> Please don't.<br> Just give me the day.|I won't speak unless you tell me to.<br> All I want is some time with you.<br> Is that man coming to the hotel?<br> - At 1 1 :00, just--|- We must go now.<br> - I must leave a note at the hotel.|- Write on this.<br> I have the paper.

Not as long|as we both can stand it.<br> - This is not a life for you.|- It is.<br> As long as it's part of yours.<br> You won't go back?<br> I won't go back.<br> ...at the theater or a reception.<br> Perhaps he might be seated|next to her.<br> Perhaps they might have another|time alone somewhere.<br> But he could not live|without seeing her.<br> Mr. Archer, I think?<br> My name is Riviere.<br> I dined with you in Paris last year.<br> Yes, I'm sorry.|I didn't quite recall.<br> I had the advantage.|I saw you in Boston, yesterday.<br> I came here on Count Olenski's|behalf because...<br> ...I believed in all good faith|that she should return to him.<br> Forgive me, Monsieur...<br> ...but I really don't understand|your purpose in coming to see me.<br> She's changed, Monsieur.<br> You knew her before?<br> I used to see her|at her husband's house.<br> The count would not have entrusted|my mission to a stranger.<br> This change that you mentioned....<br> It may be my seeing her|for the first time...<br> ...as she is, as an American.<br> She made her marriage in good faith.<br> It was a faith the count|could not share.<br> Could not understand.<br> So her faith was....<br> Broken.<br> Destroyed.<br> Returning to Europe would mean|a life of some comfort...<br> ...and considerable sacrifice...<br> ...and I would think, no hope.<br> I will fulfill my obligation to|the count and meet with the family.<br> I will tell them what he suggests|and wishes for the countess.<br> But I ask you to use|your influence with them.<br> I beg you, do not let her go back.<br> When old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow died,|they found her standing order...<br> ...48 Worth dresses,|still wrapped in tissue paper.<br> ...they wore the first lot|to the symphony...<br> He had written to her|once in Washington.<br> Just a few lines, asking when|they were to meet again.<br> And she wrote back, "Not yet. "<br> I think Julius Beaufort|started the new fashion...<br> ...by making his wife wear|her new clothes when they arrived.<br> I must say, it takes all Regina's|distinction not to look like--<br> - Her rivals?|- Like that Annie Ring.<br> - Careful, dear.|- Everybody knows.<br> Indeed. Beaufort always put|his business around.<br> Now that his business is gone,|there will be disclosures.<br> - Gone? Is it really that bad?|- As bad as anything I ever heard of.<br> Most everybody we know|will be hit one way or another.<br> Very difficult for Regina, of course.<br> And it's a pity that Countess Olenska|refused her husband's offer.<br> Why, for God's sake?<br> To put it on the lowest ground,|what will she live on now?<br> Now that Beaufort--<br> What the hell does that mean, sir?<br> ...and the allowance she gets|from the family is cut back--<br> - I'm sure she has something.|- A little.<br> Whatever remains,|after sustaining more debt.<br> I know the family paid|close attention to Riviere...<br> ...and considered his offer carefully.<br> If everyone rather she be Beaufort's|mistress than a wife...<br> ...you've gone about it perfectly.<br> She won't go back.<br> That's your opinion?<br> Well, no doubt you know.<br> She might soften Mrs. Mingott, who|could give her any kind of allowance.<br> But the rest of the family|don't want to keep her here.<br> They'll simply let her...<br> ...find her own level.<br> Thank you.<br> The lamp is smoking again.|The servant should fix it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I may have to go to Washington|for a few days.<br> When?<br> Tomorrow. I'm sorry,|I should have said it before.<br> On business?<br> There's a patent case coming up|before the Supreme Court.<br> I just got the papers|from Letterblair.<br> Never mind.

You're dear to come.<br> But perhaps you only wanted|to see what I'd left you.<br> Granny, that's shocking!<br> It was shock that did this to me.|No, thank you.<br> It's all due to Regina Beaufort.<br> She came here last night...<br> ...and she asked me....<br> She asked me....|She had the effrontery...<br> ...to ask me to back Julius.<br> "Not to desert him," she said.<br> "To stand behind our common lineage|in the Townsend family."<br> If you back Julius,|you can see the family through.<br> If you don't...<br> ...we will all...<br> ...everyone of us, fall into dishonor.<br> I said to her:|Honor's always been honor...<br> ...and honesty's always been honesty|in the Mingott house...<br> And then she said, if you can|believe this, "But my name, Auntie."<br> But my name, Auntie!<br> - My name's Regina Townsend!|- I said to her:<br> Your name was Beaufort|when he covered you with jewels...<br> ...and it's got to stay Beaufort|now that he's covered you with shame.<br> Then I gave out.<br> Simply gave out.<br> And now family is arriving|expecting a funeral...<br> ...and they'll have to be entertained.<br> I don't know how many notes|Bencomb sent out.<br> - If there's anything we can do.|- Well, Ellen is coming.<br> I expressly asked for her.<br> If May sends the brougham,|I'll take the ferry.<br> Fine.<br> Fine. Thank you.<br> There, you see, Granny,|everyone will be settled.<br> Thank you, dear. Bless you.<br> I didn't want to worry Granny...<br> ...but how can you meet Ellen|if you have to go to Washington today?<br> I'm not going. The case is postponed.|I heard from Letterblair this morning.<br> Postponed? How odd.<br> Mama had a note from him|this morning too.<br> He was concerned about Granny|but had to be away.<br> He was arguing a patent case|before the Supreme Court.<br> You did say it was a patent case?<br> The whole office can't go.|Letterblair decided to go himself.<br> Then it's not postponed?<br> No, but my going is.<br> He knew it was two hours|by ferry and carriage...<br> ...from the Pennsylvania terminus|in Jersey City to Mrs. Mingott's.<br> All of two hours|and maybe a little more.<br> - You didn't expect me?|- No.<br> I nearly came to Washington.|We would've missed each other.<br> Granny Mingott sent me.|She's much better.<br> - You know, I hardly remembered you.|- Hardly remembered?<br> I mean, each time is the same.<br> You happen to me all over again.<br> Yes, I know.<br> For me too.<br> Ellen, we can't stay like this.|It can't last.<br> - We must look at reality, not dreams.|- I want us to be together.<br> I can't be your wife. Is it your idea|I should be your mistress?<br> I want us to find a world|where words like that don't exist.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> Where is that country?|Have you ever been there?<br> Can we be happy behind the backs|of people who trust us?<br> - I'm beyond caring about that.|- No, you're not.<br> You've never been beyond that.<br> I have.<br> I know what it looks like.|It's no place for us.<br> Why are we stopping?|This isn't Granny's.<br> I'll get out here.<br> You were right,|I shouldn't have come today.<br> What are you reading?<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> Because it's a different country.<br> You used to read poetry.<br> It was so nice when you read it to me.<br> You'll catch your death.<br> Of course.<br> I've been dead|for months and months. "<br> Then it occurred to him|that she might die.<br> People did. Young people,|healthy people did.<br> She might die and set him free.<br> - I didn't know when you were leaving.|- I'm not leaving.<br> Granny's asked me to take care of her.<br> - Then we must talk now.|- I'm due at Regina's.<br> Granny lent me her carriage.<br> Granny says Beaufort's a scoundrel,|but so is my husband...<br> ...and the family wants me|to return to him.<br> Only Granny understands.|She's even seen to my allowance.<br> - I must see you somewhere alone.|- In New York?<br> Where we can be alone.<br> The art museum in the park.|2:30 tomorrow.<br> I'll be at the door.<br> You came to New York|because you were afraid.<br> - Afraid?|- Of my coming to Washington.<br> I thought I would be safer.<br> Safer from me?<br> Ellen?<br> Safer from loving me?<br> Shall I come to you once|and then go home?<br> When?<br> Tomorrow.<br> The day after.<br> I'm sorry I'm late.|You weren't worried, were you?<br> - Is it late?|- It's past 7.<br> I stayed at Granny's|because Ellen came in.<br> We had a wonderful talk.|She was so dear.<br> Just like the old Ellen.|Granny was so charmed by her.<br> You can see how the family's|been annoyed with her at times.<br> Going to see Regina Beaufort|in Granny's carriage.<br> Are we dining out tonight?<br> It was the custom in old New York|for brides to appear...<br> ...in their wedding dress|during the first years of marriage.<br> But May, since returning|from Europe...<br> ...had not worn her bridal satin|until this evening.<br> May, I'm sorry.<br> My head's bursting. Please don't|tell anyone. Come home with me.<br> Shouldn't you rest?<br> My head's not as bad as that.<br> And there's something important|I must say to you right away.<br> There's something|that I've got to tell you...<br> ...about myself.<br> Madame Olenska--<br> Why should we talk|about Ellen tonight?<br> Because I should have spoken before--<br> Is it really worthwhile?<br> I know I've been unfair to her|at times. Perhaps we all have.<br> You understood her better than us,|but does it matter now that it's over?<br> How do you mean, "over"?<br> Why, since she's going back|to Europe so soon.<br> Granny approves and understands.|She's disappointed...<br> ...but she's arranged to make Ellen|financially independent of the count.<br> I thought you would have heard|today at your offices.<br> - It's impossible.|- Impossible?<br> She could stay with Granny's money,|but I guess she's given us up.<br> How do you know that?<br> From Ellen. I told you,|I saw her at Granny's yesterday.<br> And she told you yesterday?<br> No.<br> She sent me a note this afternoon.<br> Do you want to see it?<br> I thought you knew.<br> "May, dear: I have at last|made Granny understand...<br> ...that my visit to her could be|no more than a visit.<br> And she has been as kind|and generous as ever. "<br> She sees now that if I return|to Europe, I must live by myself.<br> I am hurrying back to Washington|to pack up, and I sail next week.<br> Be very good to Granny when I'm gone.<br> As good as you've always been to me.<br> If friends wish to urge me to stay,|tell them it'd be utterly useless.<br> "--tell them it'd|be utterly useless. "<br> Why did she write this?<br> I suppose because we talked|things over yesterday.<br> What things?<br> I told her that I was afraid|I hadn't always been fair to her...<br> ...and hadn't always understood|how hard it must have been for her.<br> I knew she could always|count on you...<br> ...and I wanted her to know that you|and I were the same in our feelings.<br> She understood why I wanted|to tell her this.<br> I think she understands everything.<br> My head aches too.<br> - Good night, dear.|- Good night.<br> It was, as Mrs. Archer said,|a great event for a young couple...<br> ...to give their first dinner.|It was not to be undertaken lightly.<br> There was a hired chef, two borrowed|footmen, roses from Hendersons...<br> ...Roman punch, and menus|on gilt-edged cards.<br> It was a particular triumph|that the van der Luydens...<br> ...at May's request...<br> ...stayed in the city to be present|at her farewell dinner...<br> ...for the Countess Olenska.<br> Archer saw all the harmless-looking|people at the table...<br> ...as a band of quiet conspirators...<br> ...with himself and Ellen|the center of their conspiracy.<br> He guessed he had been, for months...<br> ...the center of countless|silently observing eyes...<br> ...and patiently listening ears.<br> He understood that, somehow...<br> ...the separation between himself and|the partner of his guilt was achieved.<br> And he knew that now the whole tribe|had rallied around his wife.<br> He was a prisoner in the center|of an armed camp.<br> Regina's illness|doesn't stop Beaufort...<br> ...from devoting as much time|to Annie Ring as he can.<br> Best thing for Beaufort...<br> ...would be to go stay at|Regina's place in North Carolina.<br> He could breed trotters.<br> And the key to his release had been|returned the day before...<br> ...by mail, unopened.<br> He may stay here as a challenge|to the outrage he's created.<br> Perhaps he'll run for office.<br> Then will Annie Ring|be his first lady?<br> Was your trip from Washington tiring?<br> The heat on the train was dreadful...<br> ...but all travel has its hardships.<br> They're worth it, just to get away.<br> I mean to do a lot of traveling soon.<br> What about a little adventure, Philip?|Athens and Smyrna, maybe.<br> - Maybe even Constantinople.|- Possibly.<br> - Possibly.|- But not Naples.<br> Dr. Bencomb says there's a fever.<br> Oh, really? A fever in Naples.<br> - There's always India.|- You need three weeks for India.<br> Absolutely.<br> Beaufort may not receive invitations,|but he maintains a certain position.<br> Horizontal, I hear.<br> If this continues,|we'll see our children...<br> ...socializing with swindlers|and marrying Beaufort's bastards.<br> Has he got any?<br> Careful there, gentlemen.|Draw it mild.<br> Society has a history of tolerating|vulgar women, after all.<br> Up to a point.<br> Have you ever noticed it's|the people with the worst cooks...<br> ...who always yell about|being poisoned when they dine out.<br> Lefferts used to be|a little more adept, I thought.<br> But then, grace is not|always required...<br> ...as long as one knows the steps.<br> I've never heard Lefferts so abound...<br> ...in the sentiments|that adorn Christian manhood.<br> Indignation lends a scathing eloquence|almost as effective as fear.<br> The pressure at home|must be unrelenting.<br> I never expected to hear such|a paean to the sanctity of the home.<br> The silent organization...<br> ...which held this|whole small world together...<br> ...was determined|to put itself on record.<br> It had never|for a moment questioned...<br> ...the propriety|of Madame Olenska's conduct.<br> It had never questioned|Archer's fidelity.<br> And it had never heard of, suspected|or even conceived possible...<br> ...anything at all to the contrary.<br> From the seamless performance|of this ritual...<br> ...Archer knew that New York believed|him to be Madame Olenska's lover.<br> We were discussing the ball.<br> We have it during Easter week,|to benefit the blind.<br> And he understood|for the first time...<br> ...that his wife shared the belief.<br> You must come visit me when you do.<br> I'll write to you when I'm settled|and let you know where I am.<br> That would be lovely.<br> Shall I see you to your carriage?<br> We're driving dear Ellen home.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> I'll see you soon in Paris.<br> Oh, if you and May could come.<br> Shall we make our way to the carriage?<br> - Delightful evening.|- Good night.<br> Good night, Sillerton, Larry.<br> - It did go off beautifully, didn't it?|- Oh, yes.<br> - May I come in and talk it over?|- Of course.<br> - But you must be very sleepy.|- No, I'd like to be with you.<br> Fine.<br> If you feel up to it, May...<br> I tried to talk to you|the other evening.<br> - Yes, dear, something about yourself.|- About myself, yes.<br> It's difficult to find|the right words.<br> ...and I think...<br> ...each day a little more so.<br> It would be better for everyone|if I were to make a break.<br> You mean, give up the law?<br> Certainly that would be|a part of it, and also just...<br> ...to get away.<br> I'd like to do some traveling.<br> To Europe or....<br> How far?<br> I don't know. I thought...<br> ...India or Japan.<br> As far as that.<br> Well....<br> I'm afraid you can't, dear.<br> Not unless you take me with you.<br> That is, if the doctors let me go.|I'm afraid they won't.<br> I've been sure since this morning,|and I've been longing to tell you.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> You didn't guess?<br> Have you told anyone else?<br> Only Mama and your mother...<br> ...and Ellen.<br> I told you we had a long talk,|and how wonderful she was.<br> Did you mind my telling her?<br> Mind? Why should I?<br> That was two weeks ago, wasn't it?<br> I thought you just said|you weren't sure till today.<br> I wasn't sure then,|but I told her I was.<br> And you see...<br> ...I was right.<br> It was the room in which|most of the real things...<br> Their eldest boy, Theodore...<br> ...too delicate to be taken|to church in midwinter...<br> ...was christened there.<br> I baptize thee|in the name of the Father...<br> ...and of the Son...<br> ...and of the Holy Spirit.<br> It was here that Ted|took his first steps.<br> And here that Archer and his wife...<br> ...always discussed the future|of all their children:<br> Bill's interest in archeology.<br> Mary's passion for sports|and philanthropy.<br> Ted's inclination toward art|that led to a job with an architect...<br> ...as well as some|considerable redecoration.<br> It was in this room that Mary|announced her engagement...<br> I'm so happy for you.<br> ...to the dullest and most reliable|of Larry Lefferts' many sons.<br> And it was in this room too|that her father kissed her...<br> ...through her wedding veil before|they had motored to Grace Church.<br> When May died of infectious pneumonia|after nursing Bill safely through...<br> ...he honestly mourned her.<br> The world of her youth|had fallen into pieces...<br> ...and rebuilt itself|without her ever noticing.<br> This hard, bright blindness...<br> ...made her children conceal their|views from her, just like Archer.<br> She died thinking|the world a good place...<br> ...full of loving and harmonious|households like her own.<br> Newland Archer, in his 57th year...<br> ...mourned his past and honored it.<br> Yes, hello?<br> Chicago wants you.<br> - Dad?|- Is that you, Ted?<br> Dad, my client wants me to look at|some gardens before I start designing.<br> Sounds fine.
